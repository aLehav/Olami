ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Minors would 

not face legal action 
for seeking medical 

assistance

By ALEXA ST. JOHN

Daily Staff Reporter

Following 
the 
successful 

implementation 
of 
medical 

amnesty for minors who con-
sumed alcohol, Michigan rep-
resentatives have introduced 
a bill to extend this amnesty to 
drug use as well.

As stated in the bill, medi-

cal amnesty will prevent legal 
penalties for individuals under 
21 who seek medical assistance 
for drug use for themselves or 
another.

Rep. Al Pscholka (R–Ste-

vensville) introduced House 
Bill 4843 in August, aiming to 
encourage those at risk of over-
dosing to seek help by granting 
medical amnesty.

Pscholka 
introduced 
the 

bill after a Michigan teen died 
from a drug overdose and his 
friends did not get him medi-
cal help for fear of getting in 
legal trouble, according to CBS 
Detroit.

The bill is an amendment to 

Michigan’s 1978 Public Act 368 
titled, “Public health code,” 
which 
discusses 
the 
legal 

repercussions of being found 
in possession of drugs. Legal 
action taken with regard to 
drug possession often includes 
felony or misdemeanor charg-
es or paying a fine, depending 
on the type and amount of the 
drug.

Lifetime probation or com-

pliance with substance abuse 
and addiction services are 
potential penalties as well.

According to the Univer-

sity’s National College Health 
Assessment 
survey 
from 

February 2014, 70 percent 
of undergraduates reported 
drinking alcohol at least once

Dingell, students 
call on officials to 
curb climate change 

during Diag rally

By LYDIA MURRAY

Daily Staff Reporter

After representatives from 195 

countries at the United Nations 
Climate 
Change 
Conference 

on Saturday pledged to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions, about 

840 protesters took to the streets 
of Ann Arbor to promote the 
importance of efforts to counter-
act climate change.

The march was organized by 

several environmentally focused 
student groups in coordination 
with a series of marches held 
around the world and promoted 
by the climate change activist 
group 350.org.

Protesters walked through Ann 

Arbor holding signs and chant-
ing for more than an hour before 
arriving at the Diag for a rally.

LSA junior Alex Kendig, presi-

dent of Students for Clean Energy 
and an organizer of the march, 
said the group wanted to create an 
opportunity for the community to 
show their support for efforts to 
curb climate change.

“We saw an issue that need-

ed action, but we didn’t see any 
opportunities to act,” he said. 
“We wanted to form a march 
where people could get involved 
and show they’re on board with 
this issue.”

The 
rally 
drew 
speakers 

including U.S. Rep. Debbie Ding-
ell (D–Dearborn), Yousef Rabhi, 

a member of the county commis-
sioner and a candidate for the 
state legislature, and a few Uni-
versity students.

In her speech, Dingell talked 

about the upcoming budget legis-
lation Congress will soon review. 
She said it is important that there 
are no clauses in the budget that 
prevent the government from tak-
ing action on climate change.

“You all need to make sure 

there are no bills or parts put into 
that bill that don’t let the United 
States address climate change,”

LSA senior made 
GoFundMe after 

reading man’s 
story on HONY

By RACHEL COHEN

For the Daily

Seven photos, an idea and 

a top Facebook comment led 
Daniel Kang, an LSA senior 
and Troy, Mich. resident, to 
raise more than $15,000 on a 
GoFundMe page for a Syrian 
refugee coming to his home-
town.

Kang’s efforts to help the 

unnamed refugee were even-
tually recognized by Brandon 
Stanton, the creator of the 
Humans of New York blog and 
Facebook page.

On Dec. 8, Stanton posted a 

seven-part photo story to Face-
book as part of his collection of 
12 interviews he had with Syr-
ian refugee families during his 

trip to Turkey and Jordan. The 
interview told the story of an 
elderly refugee who was once 
a successful scientist before the 
war.

Before he sought refuge in 

Turkey, the man said his home 
was destroyed and many mem-
bers of his family were killed. 
The man said he is unable to 
work in Turkey and has been 
diagnosed with stomach can-
cer. His story drew sympathy 
and comment from hundreds 
of thousands of people, includ-
ing President Barack Obama. 
After seeing this refugee’s 
story, Kang decided to start a 
GoFundMe page to make this 
man’s transition to a new life in 
Troy a little easier.

Many refugees from Syria 

fleeing violence in war-torn 
will likely make their homes 
in Michigan, though Gov. Rick 
Snyder (R) has called for a 
pause on accepting new refu-
gees following recent terrorist

After passage with 
bipartisan support, 
bill to replace No 
Child Left Behind

By CAITLIN REEDY

Daily Staff Reporter

No Child Left Behind — the 

education reform bill signed 
into law by President George 
W. Bush in 2007 which has 

generated widespread criti-
cism in recent years — is on its 
way out.

A new bill, the Every Stu-

dent Succeeds Act, now awaits 
President Obama’s signature 
after it passed the U.S. House 
and Senate. The final bill 
includes bipartisan amend-
ments proposed by Sen. Gary 
Peters (D–Mich.).

After three failed attempts 

to replace NCLB, this is the 
first large scale education 
reform bill to achieve passage 

in recent years. Most nota-
bly, the bill states that it will 
end “the federal test-based 
accountability system of No 
Child Left Behind, restoring 
to states the responsibility for 
determining how to use feder-
ally required tests for account-
ability purposes.”

‘U’ debate team achieves 
first place national rank

Group ends semester 
with two consecutive 

tournament wins

By SOPHIE SHERRY

For the Daily

After 
two 
consecutive 

first place wins at the Wake 
Forest University and Harvard 
University debate tournaments 
earlier 
this 
semester, 
LSA 

seniors William Morgan and 
Joseph Krakoff are ranked first 
in the country, according to the 
December 2015 National Debate 
Coaches Association poll.

If the team is able to hold on 

to that ranking through next 
semester they will be the first 
University 
team 
since 
1997 

to enter the National Debate 
Tournament as the first-place 
seed. 

The college debate season 

is divided into two semesters, 
with teams competing in at 
least four tournaments each 
semester. This semester began 
in late September and ended in 
mid-November with the Wake 
Forest 
tournament, 
which 

was the largest event with 146 
teams from across the country 
competing.

The tournament takes place 

over the course of two or three 
days and begins with eight 
preliminary rounds. Next, the 
top 32 teams are seeded in a 
single elimination style bracket. 
The University team then had to 
win five elimination rounds to 
win the tournament. The team 
won their final debate on a 3-2 
decision

Morgan and Krakoff have 

been debate partners for the past 
two years. Morgan views this 
year’s success as the culmination 
of their studies.

“We 
are 
pioneering 
a 

relatively new style of debate 
that heavily involves critical 
theory based argumentation, 
evidence that comes out of Ph.D. 
programs at universities and 
faculty working there, high level 
academic work,” Morgan said. 
“We use this in debate, which 
is a little bit of a departure from 
the norm, which is mostly policy 
based arguments that come from 
think tanks or foreign affairs.”

University Debate Director 

Aaron Kall said this ranking 
will cause many of the top teams 
to spend a disproportionate 
amount of their research and 
preparation time on efforts to 
beat Morgan and Krakoff.

“It’s nice in one regard to have 

that top ranking, especially of 
your peers and the other coaches 
that vote, but at the same time 
you know that you are going to 
really have some tough debates 
in the second semester because 
everyone is going to be aiming 
for you,” Kall said.

The second semester will 

include two tournaments at 
the University of California, 
Berkeley, a tournament at the 
University of Texas at Austin 
and 
the 
National 
Debate 

Championship in Binghamton, 
N.Y. The top 78 teams in the 
country qualify for the National 
Debate Tournament, with no 
more than three team entries 
from each school.

The University debate team 

has been a runner-up at the 
National Debate Tournament for 
the past two years in a row. Last 
year the University’s team lost in 
a 3-2 decision to Northwestern 
University. Since the University 
started 
competing 
in 
the 

National Debate Tournament in 
1971 they have been the runner-
up four times, but never have 
won a National title.

Krakoff 
said 
he 
believes 

that success in the the second 
semester 
will 
come 
from 

maintaining the same work 
habits that have got them to 

Zingerman’s to partner 
with Korean restaurant

Alum’s Asian 

eatery set to open in 
Kerrytown by July

By REBECCA SOLBERG

Daily Staff Reporter

A new Korean restaurant has 

partnered 
with 
Zingerman’s 

Delicatessen to bring Korean 
flavors to Ann Arbor.

After 
experimenting 
with 

her favorite childhood dishes, 
University alum Ji Hye Kim, 
the owner of the San Street food 
cart, decided in July to open 
her own Korean restaurant. 
The restaurant will take over 
the location of Zingerman’s 
Catering in Kerrytown.

Kim said she hopes for her 

food to be accessible to people of 
all backgrounds.

“The kind of Korean food 

that I want to serve is really 
full-flavored and delicious, but 

yet approachable,” Kim said. “I 
want it to be slightly different 
Korean food than what you can 
find elsewhere in town: street 
food or regional food that you’ve 
never seen before.”

Kim 
graduated 
from 
the 

University 
in 
2002. 
After 

spending four years at a start-up 
insurance company, she said she 
decided not to continue in the 
industry.

“You put 70 hours a week 

working but you think, is this 
industry worthy of me?” Kim 
said. “Do I want to spend 70 
hours a week of my life at this 
job? I decided that I didn’t.”

After joining her husband in 

Ann Arbor, she applied for jobs 
with three different employers: 
an 
insurance 
company, 
the 

University and Zingerman’s.

Though she got called back 

to all three jobs, she chose 
Zingerman’s despite her limited 
experience in the food industry 
and the relatively lower pay. 

Kim said she was driven to take 
the Zingerman’s job because 
of her love for food, as well as 
her experience with the deli’s 
exceptional customer service.

Kim said her love for food 

began at a young age, when her 
mother made her homemade 
Korean food from scratch

“My mother didn’t teach me 

how to cook,” she said. “What 
she taught was to recognize 
good food because she fed me 
good food.”

After 
beginning 
at 

Zingerman’s, 
she 
said 
she 

realized she wanted to bring 
that same caliber of service to 
the Asian food industry.

“I was having a great time, but 

at the same time I was thinking 
wouldn’t it be great if I walked 
into a Chinese grocery story and 
got this level of food and this 
level of service,” she said.

Soon 
after 
Kim

in the past month, and 21 
percent reported using mar-
ijuana at least once in the 
past month. Eight percent 
of undergraduate students 
reported using drugs such 
as cocaine, amphetamines 
and ecstasy in the past 
month. All of these numbers 
had increased since a previ-
ous NCHA survey taken in 
2010. 

Mary Jo Desprez, direc-

tor of Wolverine Wellness, 
said alcohol and other drug 
use is a problem that spans 
the entire student popula-
tion. Wolverine Wellness is 
a program housed in Uni-
versity 
Health 
Services 

that, in part, addresses the 
potential harm of drug use 
on campus.

Though 
freshmen 
are 

often the highest risk group 
for drug use, Desprez said 
students of all ages are 
affected. Though the bill 
addresses drug use, she said 
alcohol abuse continues to 
be a bigger issue on the Uni-
versity campus.

Desprez 
said 
medical 

amnesty laws are usually 
created to address the fear 
students experience when 
debating whether or not to 
seek medical assistance.

“At U-M we have a car-

ing community and most 
students tell us they would 
call for help regardless if 
they were worried about a 
friend or a fellow student,” 
Desprez wrote in an e-mail 
interview with The Michi-
gan Daily. “For those few 
that might not, this law 
could provide an additional 
measure of certainty.”

However, these laws have 

the potential to limit the 
ability of health care pro-
fessionals to follow up with 
drug users, Desprez said. 
Prior to the introduction 
of this bill, it was often the 
citation that students would 
receive 
from 
drug 
pos-

session or other unlawful 
acts that allowed the court 
to require an educational 
intervention.

“When you remove that 

accountability loop we lose 
a strategy to talk with peo-
ple about what role alcohol 
and other drug use is play-
ing in their lives,” Desprez 
wrote. “We should continue 
to advocate for these laws to 
include options for address-
ing the potential continued 
harm to that person beyond 
the danger that is happening 
that night.”

Desprez 
said 
through 

education programs, Wol-
verine Wellness aims to 
intervene before any over-
dose happens in the first 
place.

“We have a lot more 

potential to help people by 
moderating 
their 
behav-

ior before they get to the 
point of overdose,” Desprez 
wrote. “If students learned 
how to care for their friends 
long before a potential over-
dose was happening we 
could prevent a large major-
ity of these situations.”

LSA junior Erin Dunne, 

co-director of the Students 
for Sensible Drug Policy 
organization 
on 
campus, 

said 
students’ 
misunder-

standing of the amnesty 
policy plays a large role in 
limiting reporting.

“There’s a lot of catches in 

these laws that might make 
some students be afraid,” 
Dunne said.

While some believe that 

medical amnesty laws could 
go too far, particularly in the 
case of students abusing the 
privilege to stay out of legal 
trouble, Dunne said SSDP 
generally believes medical 
amnesty should apply to all 
drugs and situations.

“You should never be in 

a situation where you are 
going to get in trouble for a 
medical condition, be that a 
condition, overdose or mis-
use,” she said.

Ultimately, Dunne said 

medical amnesty is crucial, 
especially considering the 
Michigan teen that died 
potentially because this pro-
vision was not in place.

she said. “You need to spread 
out across the country and make 
sure we walk, we talk.”

Rabhi said the way to achieve 

real input in climate change leg-
islation is by mobilizing young 
voters.

“This struggle will be won at 

the ballot box,” he said. “When 
we vote, we win. When we 
knock on doors, we win. When 
we go to the streets and protest, 
we win. We will win.”

Meghan 
O’Neill, 
a 
high 

school student in Washtenaw 
County, said she joined the 
march because she thought it 
was key for people to show their 
support.

“I think it’s really important 

to get involved in this because if 
we don’t take action, who else is 
going to?” she said. “We have to 
make a change.”

The demonstration followed 

the conclusion of the climate 
talks in Paris, where coun-
tries set a target of keeping the 
global temperature from rising 
more than 2 degrees Celsius, 

with each country submit-
ting specific goals for reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions. The 
University sent a delegation of 
students and faculty to the con-
ference where they were able to 
observe the negotiations.

Rackham student Mayank 

Vikas, one of the students on the 
delegation, said the deal is not 
as comprehensive as it could be, 
but he hopes it will lead to more 
progress in the future.

“I’m cautiously optimistic 

this deal will lead to some-
thing bigger and better,” Vikas 
said. “It’s a good start, but I 
don’t think the deal is ambi-
tious enough to actually match 
the aspirations that its text 
reflects.”

and 
History 

Prof. Paul Edwards, who also 
attended the conference, said he 
hopes the talks serve as a moti-
vating force for the University 
to take more action against cli-
mate change.

“We should be leading the 

way,” he said. “If we are really 
the leaders and the best we 
should be showing the rest of 
the world how it’s done.”

attacks in Paris, Lebanon and elsewhere.

Kang created the page the same day the 

photos were posted and said the page grew 
more popular when his friend posted the 
page’s link to her top comment on one of the 
photos.

Kang said he started the page because he 

recognized that many people get very upset 
over the refugee’s stories, but few took action 
to help the man and his family.

“A big reason why I started this is because 

I feel like people get so heartbroken over 
the refugee stories and then when it comes 
down to it, some people at the moment want 
to help but then afterwards they don’t care 
about it,” Kang said. “I wanted to jump in 
while people were prepared to help and 
give them the opportunity that they could 
do something.”

Actor Edward Norton had a similar idea. 

On Saturday afternoon, Stanton posted on 
the HONY page that Norton had contacted 
him asking to start a fundraiser for this same 
scientist. Stanton included a link to Norton’s 
fundraiser and commented on the post rec-

ognizing Kang for his fundraising efforts.

Kang said he did not expect to be recog-

nized by Stanton.

“I didn’t really think I did much, so to get 

a shout-out from (the) Humans of New York 
(creator), who I think is one of the most influ-
ential people in the world was pretty great,” 
Kang said. “The amount of people who had 
nice things to say was really foreign. I still 
don’t feel like I did that much … I can see that 
people will think that I’m doing good in the 
world so I really appreciate all of the sup-
port.”

Kang wrote in a top-ranked Facebook 

comment that he is trying to get in contact 
with Norton and has been in contact with 
other people and organizations who are 
also trying to give the scientist a better life.

Kang has also been working with the 

Lutheran Social Services of Michigan, a 
Troy-based nonprofit that helps refugees 
coming to the area find jobs, housing and 
translators if needed. If Kang cannot give 
the money to the scientist, he said he would 
donate the money to the Lutheran Social 
Services of Michigan.

Kang said he still hopes that the man will 

want to meet him when he arrives in Michi-
gan.

This refugee’s particular story touched 

Kang because the scientist said that he 
hopes Troy will be a place that respects sci-
ence.

“I think that Troy … except for maybe Ann 

Arbor is the best place (for) somebody who 
wants to raise a family that’s from another 
region and is interested in science,” Kang 
said. “It’s a very welcoming town, it’s very 
diverse and the education system is very 
good and they’re always pushing for bigger 
and greater things.”

Kang said he hopes that people will sup-

port refugees even if their stories are not 
made popular by the media.

“One big thing that I’m worried about 

regarding future donations and fundrais-
ers is that I feel that people are much more 
concerned about doing good for somebody 
that they can relate to even if they’ve never 
met them, than doing good for the masses 
in general. I think that it’s a problem with 
the media and the way of making the mass-
es unrelatable whereas Humans of New 
York always gives them a face, gives them 
a story.” Kang said. “I think in the future 
people should look towards acknowledg-
ing that everybody has their own story 
regardless of how nameless they are.”

viate pressure currently placed 
on the states and allow for more 
positive growth.

“One of the big impacts will be 

that in many ways (ESSA) relax-
es the tremendous pressure that 
schools have felt from the fed-
eral level down to the states to 
local districts and schools,” Peu-
rach said. “It broadens the capa-
bilities of states and districts in 
finding successful ways where 
they won’t be nearly as pressure 
labeled.”

The bill will strip the fed-

eral government of some of its 
power, which will be returned 
to the states, allowing them to 
decide on appropriate measures 
when tackling various issues, 
such as how to rate the success 
of individual schools. It also will 
allocate a higher percentage of 
federal funding to low-perform-
ing schools as identified by the 
individual state’s accountabil-
ity systems, which may include 
graduation rates and English 
proficiency, 
alongside 
test 

scores.

“One of the things it will 

do is open up the opportuni-
ty to cultivate improvement-
focused climates in schools and 
improvement-focused cultures 
that have been difficult to culti-
vate when the achievement level 
was so pressured,” Peurach said.

Sens. Peters and Cory Gard-

ner (R–Colo.) proposed a bipar-
tisan amendment supporting 
dual and concurrent enrollment 
in schools. This will allow high 
school students to receive col-
lege credit from courses taught 
by college-approved teachers 
while still in high school. The 
amendment will also permit 
fifth-year programs to allow 
students to continue with their 
concurrent enrollment and thus 
receive more credits.

“My provisions in this bill 

will support funding for dual 
enrollment programs that can 
help make college more afford-
able, arm students with the tools 
they need to make responsible 
financial choices in the future 
and protect our most vulner-
able children from falling into 
the school-to-prison pipeline,” 
Peters said.

Peters also championed the 

addition of two other measures. 
One concerned supporting fund-
ing for financial literacy pro-
gramming — particularly among 
at-risk youth and immigrants. 
The other additional measure 
worked to identify dual status 
youth.

In a letter to the Senate 

Health, Education, Labor and 
Pensions 
Committee, 
Peters 

described dual status youth as 
those who have “come into con-
tact with both the child welfare 
and juvenile justice system.” He 
wrote that these children are 
considered most at risk for not 
succeeding in school and con-
tribute to the current “school to 
prison pipeline.” By more accu-
rately identifying at-risk youth, 
as Peters pointed out in his let-
ter, the government can work on 
improving intervention services 
to benefit them.

Despite the intended benefits 

of ESSA, Peurach said there are 
concerns about the implications 
of 50 different achievement stan-
dards from 50 different states.

“It locates a lot of the respon-

sibility of making all of this work 
on to the state departments of 
education,” Peurach said. “Some 
departments are healthier and 
have more capacity than others 
so there is a risk in variability 
in what counts as success across 
states and variability in support 
for schools across states.”

Still, Peurach said the bill’s 

overall benefits should lead to 
greater trust in the educational 
system, and will perhaps inspire 
current college students to tailor 
their studies to the field of edu-
cation reform.

“I expect to see a real change 

in the climate and culture of 
change in schools,” he said. 
“We’ll see a rise of students 
interested in program evalu-
ations to continue to become 
more active in schools and edu-
cational innovations to make 
sure that what these people are 
trying to do actually works. I 
think it continues to open up 
the opportunities for under-
graduate and graduate students, 
as well as faculty, interested in 
getting into schools and helping 
them get better.”

the 
opportunity

Kim talked to Z ingerman’s 

founders Paul Saginaw and Ari

said they were very supportive 
and encouraged her to start 
small.

Accordingly, Kim and a

four years, then this January 
applied for and received a 
partnership with Zingerman’s.

“The

to do it slowly because I wanted 
to figure out exactly what I 
wanted to pinpoint and do.”

She also plans to make her 

own versions of the more 
famous Korean dishes, like 
bibimbap. Above all, she said 
she wants the food to fit well in

“The kind of Korean food 

I want to do will inevitably 
reflect the setting I am in, 
which is Ann Arbor,” she said.

CSG continues silencing minority voices

SINDHU SREEDHAR | MICHIGAN IN COLOR

F

our months ago, I had an 
epiphany while working at 
my beloved sleepaway camp. 

As I lay awake in 
my 
child-sized 

bunk bed, feeling 
genuinely happy 
for the first time 
in a long time, 
I realized that 
I had things to 
say and I wanted 
to find a way to 
say them. Eight 
Daily 
columns 

later, I am ready 
to reflect on the 
heart of what I was really trying to 
communicate.

In my first column, I described how 

I began feeling empty and sad around 
this time last year. My heart and mind 
had finally come to terms with how 
disconnected I felt at the University, 
and I had trouble thinking of valid 
reasons to get out of bed each morning. 
Luckily, I was able to rediscover 
happiness over the summer by doing 
what I loved (working at my camp) 
with people I loved (shout out to my 
campers and co-counselors). Yet even 
while on such a high, I was perceptive 
enough to worry that I might relapse 
into depression as soon as I set foot on 
 

University property.

Miraculously, it’s finals week and 

I’m just as happy as I was back in 
August. However, I had to completely 
change my attitude this semester to 
ensure my happiness would stick, 
a process that I described through-
out my columns. Learning to see 
life through a positive lens has been 
draining at times, especially on bad 
days when I want to give up and revert 
to my old mentality. But staying opti-
mistic has also made life so much 
 

more enjoyable.

According to Forbes contributor 

Travis Bradberry, specific steps are 
required to stay optimistic, such as 
identifying positive thoughts and 
writing down negative thoughts to 
evaluate them more rationally. My 
attempted optimism began more 
haphazardly. I decided I was sick of 
being sad, and therefore I no longer 
tolerated sad thoughts. Whenever 
one surfaced, I attributed it to sleep 
deprivation and moved on.

Unsurprisingly, 
my 
simplistic 

optimism failed, and I crashed from 
my happy summer high right before 
classes started. I had just Skyped my 
best friend from home, who told me I 
was the most smiley and enthusiastic 
she’d ever seen me. I informed 
her that I had finally attained true 
happiness and my depression was 
gone forever. But as soon as I hung 
up, the wonderful feelings vanished. 
It dawned on me that I had to finish 
two more semesters at a place that 
didn’t feel like home, with people I 
didn’t connect with. I wasn’t sure if 
I could get through it, and worse yet, 
I felt disingenuous for proclaiming 
that I had finally found happiness 
when I clearly hadn’t.

In retrospect, I’m glad I crashed 

as early as I did. When I woke up 
feeling happy again two days later, 
I realized this wasn’t depression. 
This was just a bad day. If I could get 
through this bad day, then I could 
get through all the future bad days 
thrown my way. As the semester 
progressed, I rediscovered coping 
strategies, such as journaling and 
working out, which reduced my 
bouts of sadness from days to mere 
hours. And of course, taking time 
to connect with people and do my 
favorite hobbies gave me something 
to look forward to every time I start-
ed feeling down.

At first, I thought having a positive 

attitude meant being positive about 

everything in my life. But eventually, 
I realized it meant knowing when to 
step up versus walk away graciously. 
While seeking new connections 
with people who made me happy, 
I sacrificed a lot of superficial 
connections that had contributed 
to my emptiness and depression. I 
called my mom several times and 
told her I felt like a quitter, but she 
assured me I made the right choice 
and that I needed to re-label it in my 
head to sound more empowering. 
Like the song from “Frozen,” I wasn’t 
giving up; I was letting go. 

With all the positive changes in 

my life, I finally feel true happiness 
in relation to my college experience, 
and I no longer worry about the good 
vibes disappearing. Though it took 
me longer than most, I think I fig-
ured out how to do college right and 
I can’t wait to see where my positive 
attitude takes me next semester.

I’m in a place where there is 

no shortage of opportunity to do 
what I love, and no shortage of 
people to whom I can connect. I’m 
curious to see what will happen 
when I graduate and find myself 
in a whole new environment. After 
my first column, a University alum 
reached out and said that the coping 
strategies she learned while dealing 
with tough situations in college 
prepared her to deal with future 
challenges in her life and career. 
Based on her experience and my 
own unwavering optimism, I’m 
confident that I will be prepared for 
whatever obstacles come my way.

Finding a platform to say all the 

things I wanted to say this semester 
was such a privilege. Thank you so 
much to everyone who supported 
me along the way.

Editor’s Note: The original version 

of this Michigan in Color piece was 
published November 30. The Michigan 
Daily temporarily retracted the piece 
due to factual inaccuracies brought to 
the Daily’s attention after publication. 
This is the final version of this piece.

On November 22, I, along with 

the other 10 members of the Campus 
Inclusion Commission under the 
Central 
Student 
Government, 

resigned. The original goal of the 
commission was to provide a space 
within 
the 
student 
government 

where students with marginalized 
identities felt safe voicing their 
concerns. 
However 
we, 
as 
a 

commission, came to the conclusion 
that CSG’s efforts to make campus 
more 
inclusive 
weren’t 
entirely 

genuine and we felt that working with 
them wasn’t in our best interests. 
 

We left, not because the chair of our 
commission was fired, but because of 
what we believe are the reasons why 
he was fired — for making noise, for 
demanding justice, after I, personally, 
faced discrimination within CSG, for 
questioning CSG’s homogeneity, and 
for advocating for minority voices. In 
our opinion, for doing his job.

As a woman of color, I often feel 

as though I have limited influence 
in spaces. Because of that, I often let 
problematic things go unchecked and 
don’t say anything for fear of retalia-
tion. This experience will not be one of 
them. Here’s my story.

This past September, an Executive 

Committee member of CSG met with 
me to inform me of a significant change 
within student government structure 
— three separate commissions would 
be merged into one larger Campus 
Inclusion 
Commission. 
As 
the 

executive chair of the LGBTQ Issues 
Commission, that decision would 
significantly impact my role. However, 
before I could say anything, he seemed 
to imply that if the commission didn’t 
comply with the new structure, we 
could leave CSG, and they would find 
people to replace us. The preemptive 
threat caught me off guard and I felt 
pressured to go along with what he 
was saying, simply because of the 
power dynamic. He is a white man in 
a higher position than me, and had just 
implied that that I was dispensable. 
I’m a woman of color with seemingly 
no real authority in that space. Whose 
voice really matters here? I felt as 
though the LGBTQ community that I 
was advocating for had suddenly lost 
any voice that it may have ever had 
 

in CSG.

That meeting set the tone for the 

rest of my involvement in CSG. How-
ever, despite that encounter, I still 
tried to be open to the idea of working 
with the student government because 
of the credibility they have under the 
administration and the reach they 

have with students. I continued to 
brush that event and my skepticism 
aside in order to do what I came to do 
— create a more inclusive campus.

Things moved quickly from there, 

as they do in CSG. Applications were 
sent out for a chair position of what 
we now called the Campus Inclusiv-
ity Commission, or CIC. While I was 
invited to apply, I doubted I’d stand a 
chance in the process and didn’t have 
additional time to give an organization 
that had already shown they didn’t 
care about me. I ultimately decided not 
to, and a new commission chair was 
appointed soon after. The new com-
mission first met in mid-October, and 
by the middle of November, we had 
three large projects in process, and the 
members of our new team began to get 
closer. Feeling decently comfortable 
with them, I offhandedly mentioned 
the unsettling interaction I’d had with 
the CSG Executive Committee mem-
ber. Our chair immediately suggested 
that we report the microaggression 
to the rest of the Executive Commit-
tee, and after a day of thinking over 
it, I decided it should be addressed. 
Though I didn’t want to cause trouble 
or ill will within CSG, I believed that 
discussing the comment and its impact 
could begin to create a more inclusive 
campus, one person at a time. Espe-
cially given that doing so aligned with 
the mission of the inclusion committee 
that student government had just cre-
ated, I’d believed we would have their 
support. I was very wrong.

After the CIC chair and I reported 

the incident to the rest of the Execu-
tive Committee, we attempted sev-
eral methods of restorative justice. We 
tried implementing an ally training for 
all members of the assembly. We tried 
getting the Executive Committee 
member who’d made the comment to 
go to an ally training. We tried creating 
a new position on the Executive Com-
mittee to hold them all accountable to 
using inclusive language and taking 
the needs of marginalized students 
into consideration. These initiatives 
were either not taken seriously, were 
not done to CSG’s best efforts or didn’t 
even happen. For example, the person 
who had committed the microaggres-
sion against me was supposed to go 
to a Growing Allies retreat, a training 
that would educate him on microag-
gressions and social identity. Though 
he did receive a link to the wrong web-
site — which was not his fault — he still 
knowingly signed up for and attended 
a sexual assault training instead. His 
failure to question the training he 
was attending and how it related to 
the harm he did indicates to me that 
he was merely fulfilling a mandatory 
requirement instead of showing a true 
dedication to learning.

Finally, I met with the CSG advis-

er and president last week to talk 

about the original microaggression I 
had faced, at this point, two months 
ago. I explained it yet again, thinking 
this would be my final dealing with 
this issue. Instead of simply listening 
to what had happened and helping 
me find the solution I’d wanted, they 
began probing me about the commis-
sion chair — the person who’d helped 
me report in the first place. They 
asked me how I felt that our commis-
sion chair had taken charge in deal-
ing with the issue and making sure 
I was treated fairly. Though I didn’t 
fully understand why I was being 
asked about our commission chair, 
I was honest with them in saying he 
only took charge in dealing with the 
issue when I had asked him to. At the 
time, I’d believed they were just try-
ing to support me, but I now see that 
they had been trying to ambush me 
into providing the Executive Com-
mittee with an excuse to fire him.

I realized this on November 20, 

when I saw an e-mail in my inbox 
from the Executive Committee. It 
said, very bluntly and without expla-
nation, that our commission chair 
had been fired. In their words, “the 
chair of the Campus Inclusion Com-
mission was vacated.” The now-for-
mer commission members met with 
a member of the Executive Commit-
tee and the CSG adviser for one last 
meeting, in which we were told sev-
eral of the reasons the commission 
chair was fired. While some of the 
reasons given were understandable, 
other factors they listed and implied 
should have never been considered. 
For example, the Executive Commit-
tee member mentioned he didn’t like 
that the CIC chair told him to check 
his privilege during several meet-
ings. Even though our committee 
explained to him that this is a crucial 
part of inclusion work, he continued 
to complain that the CIC chair was 
belittling him for not understanding 
certain issues. Because of comments 
like this, it seemed that what the 
Executive Committee member was 
most upset about was the CIC chair’s 
challenging his perspective — a bias I 
doubt was applied to his friend (who 
made the microaggressive comment 
to me) when deciding what conse-
quences would befall him.

Though I will always be invested 

in advocating for a more inclusive 
campus, I (and the rest of the former 
CIC members) have realized that 
within student government is not the 
place to do it. From the unchecked 
comments to the subtle power plays 
to the unjust firing of our com-
mission chair, CSG is no longer an 
organization I trust or am willing to 
 

work for.

Maintaining happiness

FROM THE DAILY

Phase out fossil fuels 

The University must investigate divestment from oil and coal
C

oinciding with the last five days of the United Nations 
Climate Change Conference, Divest and Invest — the student 
campaign advocating for the University to divest from fossil 

fuel companies — hosted a Pledge to The Planet Climate Action Week 
to raise awareness about the University’s role in combatting climate 
change this past week. Similarly, during his last fireside chat of the 
semester, University President Mark Schlissel answered questions 
about his stance on fossil fuel divestment. While Schlissel maintained 
that the University is committed to sustainability, he believes fossil fuel 
divestment is ineffective and a “mostly symbolic action.” One day later, 
Schlissel released a statement on the University’s role in addressing 
climate change, sustainability and the possibility of divestment.

Though 
his 
concerns 
are 
realistic, 

Schlissel’s 
logic 
regarding 
fossil 
fuel 

divestment is flawed. Divestment from fossil 
fuels is more than symbolic; it’s a tangible 
action that demonstrates the University isn’t 
complicit in an industry that’s destroying our 
environment. Schlissel must reconsider his 
statement and request that the University’s 
Board of Regents form a committe dedicated 
to investigating the University’s investments 
in fossil fuel companies — which is what 
the Divest and Invest campaign is currently 
advocating for. 

There is a three-pronged requirement for 

the University to form this committee: there 
must be a consensus on campus for the issue, 
the industry or issue is antithetical to the 
University’s core values and the organizations 
being examined are uniquely responsible for 
the issue at hand. Divestment from fossil fuel 
companies fits all three criteria.

According to the Divest and Invest 

Campaign, the University has about $1 billion 
of its $10 billion endowment invested in 
fossil fuels. However, the group only seeks 
to have the University investigate coal and 
oil investments, providing a gradual and 
reasonable way for the University to divest 
from fossil fuels. 

In March, Central Student Government 

passed a resolution supporting the divestment 
campaign. The Senate Assembly also voiced 
its support for the resolution just last month. 
Agreement on the issue of climate change by 
both students and faculty demonstrates the 
urgency of the issue, which the University 
should not ignore. 

Other universities have already taken steps 

to reduce their financial investment in fossil 

fuels. Three months ago, the University of 
California system sold the $200 million it 
had invested in coal and oil sands. Stanford 
University, 
Georgetown 
University 
and 

Syracuse University have pledged to divest 
from coal mining companies. Other schools, 
such as New York City’s New School, have 
not only dropped fossil fuel stocks from their 
investment portfolios, but have also reshaped 
curricula to promote sustainability and 
combat climate change. About 40 universities 
have made such commitments, and the list of 
corporations and financial institutions that 
have fully or partially divested is large and 
growing fast. 

However, the University has yet to make 

a comprehensive study of divestment that 
would weigh its commitment to sustainability 
against the effect divestment might have on its 
endowment. No large research university can 
afford to mismanage its endowment, nor can it 
fail to examine its options when it can clearly 
identify investments that stand opposed to 
its professed values. Indeed, the Board of 
Regents has dropped socially irresponsible 
investments twice in the past, divesting itself 
of tobacco companies and entities associated 
with apartheid in South Africa. 

Schlissel objects to divestment in part 

because it would not reduce carbon emissions. 
But neither of the University’s previous 
divestments were expected to solve their 
associated problems. They were steps taken

FILM REVIEW
‘Sea’ a shipwreck

By MADELEINE GAUDIN

Daily Arts Writer

“In the Heart of the Sea” 

is a beautiful trainwreck, or 
perhaps its better to call it a 
beautiful ship-
wreck. Visually 
stunning 
and 

painfully 
bor-

ing, the latest 
from 
director 

Ron 
Howard 

(“Rush”) is a 
film 
adapta-

tion 
of 
the 

true story that 
inspired 
Her-

man Melville’s 
“Moby Dick.” It’s not a “Moby 
Dick” movie but it’s also not not 
a “Moby Dick” movie.

The film begins with a young 

Melville, played by Ben Whishaw 
(“Spectre”) approaching Thom-
as Nickerson (Brendan Gleeson, 
“In Bruges”), the lone survivor 
of the whaling ship Essex, in the 
hopes of uncovering the secrets 
of the ship’s final voyage. Told 
mostly in flashbacks, Thomas’s 
story revolves around the ship’s 
first mate Owen Chase (Chris 
Hemsworth, “The Avengers”), 
a shift in main characters that 
can be confusing if you, like me, 
can’t understand every word of 
Gleeson’s scruffy accent. I spent 
the entire film thinking that 
Owen Chase was narrating the 
story to Melville — oops.

The facts of the story are pret-

ty incredible. A mythic whale 
singlehandedly taking down a 
ship full of men should be cin-
ematic gold, but “In the Heart 
of the Sea” manages to make the 
extraordinary painfully ordi-
nary. It could be the only film 

to ever make an audience think, 
“Cannibalism? Mass destruc-
tion? So what.” The characters 
are underdeveloped and difficult 
to care about — to the point that 
you might find yourself rooting 
for the whale to end things as 
soon as possible.

Literary snobs in coffee shops 

across America (myself includ-
ed) breathed a collective sigh of 
relief upon discovering that “In 
the Heart of the Sea” isn’t really 
a “Moby Dick” movie. But mak-
ing a movie about the true story 
that inspired a book is not only 
confusing, it’s limiting. There-
fore, the film is defined not only 
by what it is, but also by what 
it isn’t. It isn’t a literary epic. It 
isn’t a known story. Then, what 
is it? Because ultimately it is as 
much about “Moby Dick“ as it 
isn’t. The captain isn’t named 
Ahab but that doesn’t really mat-
ter because the audience knows 
it’s the same person, only a sim-
pler, less compelling version. “In 
the Heart of the Sea” is an origin 
story that desperately does not 
want to be an origin story.

The only thing keeping the 

film afloat is its cinematography. 
In shots that resemble Turner 
paintings, the sea is a power-

ful beast, churning with color 
and life. Storms sweep violently 
across the water and sunsets 
burn against the massive sky. 
In that sense, the sea is the best 
character in the film, more com-
plicated and compelling than 
any of the humans. The camera 
moves vertiginously, allowing 
the audience to empathize with 
the character’s seasickness — the 
closest thing to an emotional tie 
in the film. During a particularly 
nasty storm, the camera alter-
nates between sweeping aerial 
shots and underwater shots at 
deck level, spinning and cutting 
at nauseating speeds. Similarly, 
the whale is a masterwork of 
CGI. A while speckled monster 
covered in scratches and bar-
nacles, the whale is as beautiful 
and is it terrible. It’s complicat-
ed and mysterious in ways that 
none of its human counterparts 
are. Nature brutally defeats man 
in “In the Heart of the Sea,” but 
the audience is glad that it does.

Ultimately, visual aesthetics 

can’t save “In the Heart of the 
Sea” from being a dull and emo-
tionless attempt at telling (or 
sort of telling) one of the great-
est stories in history.

ALBUM REVIEW
Rozay does it

By SHAYAN SHAFII

Daily Arts Writer

When 50 Cent exposed Rick 

Ross as a former correctional offi-
cer, it seemed his career as a rapper 
was irreparably 
fucked. Instead 
of just taking the 
loss and picking 
up a new hustle 
(competitive 
eating?), 
Offi-

cer Ricky Rozay 
vacuum-sealed 
his echo cham-
ber 
and 
took 

his delusions of 
grandeur to the next level. The 
rest is history.

He hit his peak with the 2012 

release of Rich Forever (one of the 
greatest titles in recent rap his-
tory), where for the first time it 
seemed he was actually crazy 
enough to believe his own fan-
tasies. While Rick Ross and his 
“untouchable” Maybach Music 
Empire have since taken more than 
a few stumbles, the only thing that 
has remained unscathed is Ross’s 
intense desire to be something in 
between El Chapo and Jay Z.

What makes his latest effort, 

Black Market, particularly inter-
esting is a noticeable shift in narra-
tion. We finally get some insight on 
William Roberts: the man behind 
the cardboard Scarface mansion. 
The lush multimillion-dollar beats 
are present as usual, but Black 
Market isn’t another cookie-cutter 
mafia movie. Instead of the traitor 
in our midst, we get Mariah Carey 
on a surprisingly pop-y track 
(“Can’t Say No”) that Ross sounds 
right at home on. Instead of the 
wall of henchman blocking the 
head Bawse, we get a song where 
Roberts 
contemplates 
quitting 

promethazine cough syrup for the 
sake of his mother (“Smile Mama, 
Smile”). Hardly the thoughts and 
actions of a real kingpin, but that’s 
a good thing.

It seems in attempt to paper 

over the cracks in his façade, 
Black Market also hits some of the 
brightest peaks in Ross’s career 
from a technical perspective. “One 
of Us” sees Ross trade verses with 
Nas and actually keep up. When 
he says “You getting money, got 
a body? / Then you one of us” it’s 
easy to forget that the closest he 
has ever been to murderers is 
when he monitored them from the 
outside of a prison cell.

There’s also “Free Enterprise,” 

where Ross alternates between his 
classic luxury rap bars and outra-
geous threats. He likens “beefing 
with broke n****s” to pulling teeth 
just moments before addressing 
his dreams of assassinating Don-
ald Trump “like Zimmerman” — 
A line so absurd, the first time I 
heard it I laughed loud enough for 
someone to come to my study car-
rel and tell me to quiet down.

The most infectious track on 

the album is “Crocodile Python” 
(no such animal or material exists, 
but again, we’ll let it slide), where 
Ross levitates over a beat made of 
yak’s wool and chinchilla fibers, 
or some other expensive sounding 
shit. Point being, this is Ross at his 
smoothest. “Rims on my whip got it 
lookin hypnotic / Stuffing money in 
my pockets as you n***s watchin,” 
is about as Rick Ross as it gets. He 
also compares the size of his chain 
to the girth of a python. Say what 
you will about his fraudulent per-
sona and one-dimensional verses, 
but his ear for beats and steadfast 
commitment to character has to be 
considered admirable.

In a year that’s seen an increased 

focus on ghostwriters (I’m looking 
at you, Drake), Ross also opens 
up about his presence as a ghost-
writer himself on “Ghostwriter:” 
“Fat boy behind all of your favor-
ite flows, man.” For a guy who 
routinely lies about killing people 
and pushing enough cocaine to 
fill a Brinks truck, he takes great 
pride in having (allegedly) written 
all of his own rhymes. As if that 
feat alone warrants a victory lap, 
he spends the hook triumphantly 
shouting, “I be so lonely at the 
top!” for the bulk of the track.

Regardless of your preference 

for the more sinister-sounding 
Rick Ross from Rich Forever, this 
is about as good as a “Rick Ross 
album” can be. It’s filled start-
to-finish with some of the best 
beats this year (featuring manda-
tory production assistance from 
J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League), has some 
of his most memorable bars to 
date and is overall an aesthetically 
cohesive project.

Rick Ross is never going to 

make a life-changing album, and 
it would be stupid to expect him 
to; it’s simply not within him. The 
best he can do is make something 
that blows out your car speakers 
without you regretting how you 
blew them out, and that’s what he’s 
done here, again.

ALBUM REVIEW
Sensual ‘Late Nights’

By MATT GALLATIN

Daily Arts Writer

Jeremih’s music evokes a vel-

vet fantasy. The lyrics are almost 
exclusively and sexual, and the 
production 
mimics 
this 

implicit sensu-
ality. Take his 
enormous 
hit 

“Birthday Sex” 
— you know 
exactly 
what 

you’re getting. 
The 
genius 

of Jeremih is 
that he still manages to set him-
self ahead of the competition at a 
time when seductive and “alter-
native” R&B is everywhere.

Perhaps even more impressive 

is that he has done this without 
releasing a true album since 2010. 
But instead of coming across as a 
throwback, his new Late Nights: 
The Album, like all of Jeremih’s 
releases, is years ahead. The fea-
tures pull from some of the most 
in-the-moment artists (Migos, 
Ty Dolla $ign, Future and Jhené 
Aiko to name a few) and the pro-
duction feels as sharply smooth 
as ever. The result is an album 
so infectious and addictive that 
you’ll find yourself listening to it 
over and over and over.

Single “Oui” takes that addic-

tive quality to another level. It’s 
a diamond-studded work that is 
so perfectly crafted and layered 
that it demands to be replayed. 
It gives and sustains just enough 
to draw you in and make you still 
want more. Such is the strength 
of Jeremih, and this skill is used 
throughout Late Nights. “Impa-
tient” and “Remember Me” croon 
higher and higher, just grazing a 

climax before pulling off. This 
quality is what has allowed Jer-
emih to inhabit a strange space of 
being both viscerally associated 
as a “back-in-the-day” artist and 
still wield a radio-relevant force 
today. If you’re in college, “Down 
On Me” and “Birthday Sex” were 
likely played at your high school 
homecoming dances. Depending 
on your experience, they either 
evoke fond or regretful memo-
ries — but they certainly invoke 
memories. That Jeremih is still 
making songs that crystallize the 
times (“Don’t Tell ‘Em”) and that 
reveal a talent beyond just sing-
ing over catchy beats.

Part of this talent involves his 

ability to effortlessly integrate 
with so many artists. Recently, 
he appeared on the new Chance 
the Rapper track, “Somewhere 
in Paradise,” a bright, optimistic 
and trumpeting song. Jeremih’s 
voice 
is 
another 
instrument 

that weaves in with the orches-
tra. “Giv No Fucks” from Late 
Nights, on the other hand, seam-
lessly incorporates the Atlanta 
rap group Migos — the aesthetic 
antithesis of Chance the Rapper 

— and finds Jeremih leaning on 
the side of trap. Yet neither seems 
at odds with the other, a testa-
ment to the fluidity and ethereal-
ity of Jeremih’s croon.

Of all of the fantasy worlds that 

Jeremih has painted, Late Nights 
is certainly the most mature and 
brooding. His first two albums 
felt, rightly, more youthful and 
full of discovery. This ethos 
has been replaced with a confi-
dent and seasoned professional. 
“Know you probably worried 
what I’m used to,” he sings on 
“Impatient”; this isn’t the Jer-
emih fresh out of music school. 
He still surprises though, and the 
best moment comes as the album 
closes. After the long night of 
partying that the majority of Late 
Nights alludes to, “Paradise” is 
the moment when the sun comes 
up. The bass and synths fade to 
reveal a tender acoustic guitar 
with Jeremih’s voice as the main 
attraction. It’s a beautiful and 
disarming moment that sees Jer-
emih reflecting on the wonder of 
life. “And they say it gets better,” 
he sings. It seems the same is true 
for his music.

The true meaning of 
Netflix Christmas

I’m a sucker for Christmas. I 

love tacky store windows with 
paintings of reindeer and piles 
of crunchy fake snow. I love the 
way the smell of molasses drifts 
to my bedroom 
all the way from 
the kitchen 
when my mom 
bakes ginger-
bread men. I 
love the cringe-
y Christmas 
music, espe-
cially Michael 
Buble’s aggres-
sively no-homo 
cover of “Santa Baby.” But most 
of all — more than all the holi-
day pop culture and more than 
spending time with my friends 
and family — I love Christmas 
episodes of TV.

Christmas on TV is goddamn 

magical, a sparkly time of year 
when characters say what they 
feel and hug and show each 
other the meaning of friendship. 
There’s a reason why Christmas 
episodes of sitcoms are often 
cited as their finest hours — “Mr. 
Hankey, The Christmas Poo” 
from “South Park,” “The One 
with the Holiday Armadillo” 
from “Friends” and “The Strike” 
from “Seinfeld,” to name just a 
few classics. TV Christmases 
tend to be warm and satisfying, 
but are also saturated with drama 
and intrigue. The holiday coin-
cides with the mid-season break 
that many network series take at 
the end of the calendar year, fol-
lowing the traditional “Novem-
ber sweeps” period where shows 
try to garner key ratings by pro-
viding jam-packed and exciting 
episodes.

No matter your religious affili-

ation (or lack thereof), Christmas 
episodes are prime entertain-
ment. I grew up without any 
religious affiliation. Though I 
have relatives who celebrate both 
Christmas and Hanukkah, the 
holidays were always a time for 
decorations and fun secular din-
ners for our branch of the Gilke 
family tree. Christmas episodes 
are designed to appeal equally to 
those who celebrate the holiday 
and those who do not. Whether 
you celebrate Chrismukkah or 
are a godless heathen like myself, 
there’s a special, heartwarming 
joy in watching that “West Wing” 
Christmas episode.

In preparation for this column, 

I took a break from studying 
for finals to chill with Netflix 
and revisit a few of my favorite 
Christmas episodes from recent 
years. “The O.C.” ’s “Chrismuk-
kah” and “Seinfeld” ’s “The 

Strike” have already achieved 
cult status, but other shows have 
turned out some equally great 
holiday episodes.

I was obsessed with the late, 

great NBC series “Community” 
in high school. (“Obsessed” is 
an understatement; if you could 
crack open my skull at any 
moment, Abed quotes would pour 
out instead of blood.) I could list 
off 20 episodes I know by heart, 
but two of my absolute favorites 
are the show’s Christmas-themed 
installments, “Regional Holiday 
Music” and “Abed’s Uncontrol-
lable Christmas.”

“Abed’s Uncontrollable Christ-

mas” should be the model of a 
perfect Christmas episode. Most 
of the episode’s events take place 
in Abed’s increasingly unhinged 
mind, as he hallucinates the 
study group being claymation 
characters and going on a WIlly 
Wonka-style journey to find the 
true meaning of Christmas. It’s 
simultaneously funny, heartfelt 
and deeply melancholy, as all 
holiday episodes (and holidays) 
tend to be.

The holiday season is an emo-

tionally complex time of year. 
For those of us who have recently 
lost family members or suffered 
a break in our nuclear unit, a 
holiday can serve as a reminder of 
all those bygone “perfect” Christ-
mases or Hanukkahs or Kwan-
zaas. Holidays as a construct are 
full of warmth and happiness, 
so every imperfect one feels like 
there is something missing. The 
ritual is disrupted.

As Abed takes his friends on 

an animated journey through the 
annals of his mind, it is eventu-
ally revealed why he is imagining 
the world in claymation. In the 
past, Abed’s mother came to visit 
him every Christmas season. But 
she sends him a letter saying that 
she won’t be able to make it this 
year — she has moved on, remar-
ried and built a new family. Abed 
doesn’t have a place in it. The 
“uncontrollable Christmas” the 
episode portrays is his attempt to 
reconcile the lost ideal of a per-
fect holiday with the lonely state 
of mind he’s in. He’s stranded 
alone at school for the holidays, 
and even pop culture can’t fill the 
void that his estranged family 
left him.

Toward the end of the epi-

sode, “Community” reveals the 
alternative to traditional fam-
ily holidays. Friends are just as 
important of a familial unit, and 
Abed’s pals rescue his holiday. As 
Abed’s animated self (literally) 
freezes into a catatonic ice block, 
and it’s up to the study group to 

sing a sweet song and melt his 
heart. Abed’s mother may have 
broken their tradition, but his 
friends patched the holiday back 
together.

One of my other favorite 

holiday episodes is “Christmas 
Party,” from season two of 
“The Office.” This installment 
is meaner-spirited than “Com-
munity,” and all the sourness is 
due to Michael Scott, the acer-
bic but lovable boss from Hell. 
In “Christmas Party,” Michael 
organizes an impromptu white 
elephant gift exchange because 
he’s dissatisfied with the hand-
knit oven mitt that Phyllis made 
for his present. Michael preaches 
the merits of expensive presents: 
“It’s, like, this tangible thing you 
can point to and say, ‘Hey Man, I 
love you this many dollars worth.’ 
” In his eyes, a cheap gift is basi-
cally a fuck-you to his entire exis-
tence. For us watching, it’s a very 
public (and hilarious) demonstra-
tion of his poor character.

But since this is “The Office,” 

a show where every biting joke 
is met with equal sweetness, one 
of the episode’s subplots deals 
with Jim’s heartfelt gift to Pam. 
He buys her a teapot stuffed with 
inside jokes — and a card pre-
sumably confessing his crush on 
her — because “Christmas is the 
time to tell people how you feel.” 
The teapot gets passed around 
at the gift exchange, but even-
tually ends up back with Pam, 
because she realizes that Jim put 
it together just for her.

If I’m a sucker for Christmas, 

I’m even more of a sucker for 
romantic gestures, and this is 
right up there with the best 
of them. (Jim-and-Pam is my 
paradigm of perfect love, and 
that is my cross to bear.) On TV, 
Christmas is a time for telling 
people how you feel. This often 
takes the form of a kiss or a 
sweet gesture to close out a mid-
season story arc, but just as fre-
quently, telling people how you 
feel means demonstrating your 
commitment to a friendship and 
picking up someone’s fallen spir-
its, like Abed’s friends do for him 
in the “Community” episode. 
Maybe because I missed a Bible 
lecture, but I don’t really know 
the true meaning of Christmas 
— nor do I really care. According 
to TV, Christmas is made of plot 
sweetness, friends and family 
and a teapot stuffed with inside 
jokes.

blank, unemo-
tional faces. 
Her band was 
mid-set, just 
absolutely tear-
ing through 
tracks from all 
across their 
career, but all 
these bearded dudes and flannel-
wearing mid-30s couples just 
looked dead inside.

This was at a Sleater-Kinney 

show, and Sleater-Kinney was 
being fucking incredible (as 
usual), so I don’t think unmet 
expectations were the problem. 
Brownstein played guitar like a 
true possessed rock star, convuls-
ing around the stage and wreak-
ing havoc on the music. Corin 
Tucker’s voice remains one of 
the great mysteries of the world, 
howling in this powerful, soulful 
way that nobody will ever be able 
to recreate. And Janet Weiss is an 
underrated stud on the drums, 
skillfully providing the backbeat 
to Brownstein and Tucker’s fire-
and-ice musical interaction. But 
through no fault of the band’s 
own, the crowd just really, really 
sucked, and it brought down the 
whole performance just a bit. 
Brownstein had no external ener-
gy to feed off of, everything going 
on off stage was dull and there 
were none of the beautiful com-
munal moments that make get-
ting together with tons of people 
to listen to music worth it.

I hate to say it, but I kind of 

saw it coming. I went to the 
Sleater-Kinney show by myself, 
because while last week was 
crazy hectic for any student, I’m 
the kind of person who will do 
whatever he can to see his favor-
ite band live. I know that going 
to shows alone can be a risky, 
potentially awkward endeavor, 
but I wasn’t worried. I covered 
Sleater-Kinney in Chicago back 
in the summer, and for that set I 
was also entirely among strang-
ers. But while I was camped out 
for hours at the front of the stage 
at Pitchfork, I was surrounded by 
young die-hard fans with weird 
hairstyles who were just insanely, 
infectiously hype to see the band. 
So whether I knew them or not, 
in Royal Oak I was going to be 
with my people.

Flash forward to actually get-

ting inside the venue, and the 
entire vibe is different. I’m one 
of the youngest people in a room 
filled with all these suburban hip-
ster couples who could barely be 
bothered to smile. I didn’t want to 
judge based on appearances (after 
all, they looked like I’ll probably 
look in 15 years), but once the 
show started, nobody acted any 
different. The crowd was quiet, 
standing around like statues and 
just looking like they were there 
out of obligation. There was no 
dancing, no connection among 
strangers and no sense that peo-
ple were excited or felt like what 
they were seeing was special. 
And this was right in the front 
of the main floor, where most 
people stand outside for hours to 
be. Don’t get me wrong, I still had 
loads of fun watching S-K play 
some of my favorite songs back to 
back to back to back, barely tak-
ing a breath in between, but I def-
initely felt isolated, like there was 
a serious detachment between me 
and all the older people around 
me. There was a guy in a baseball 
cap right in front of me, literally 
as close to the band as you could 
possibly get, and he never moved 
except to half-heartedly clap 
after some of the songs — and 
he was indicative of most of the 
crowd. All these “fans” with the 
best spot in the whole venue just 
looked so bored.

I realize you’re not reading 

music columns from a college 
kid to get told what to do, but 
if you’re going to spend money 
on a band you like and go to a 
concert, why act so uncaring and 
unmoved about it? Just think 
about how unreal it is to go to 
a show, any show — how our 
brains inexplicably recognize 
the noise coming from the stage 
as beautiful, invaluable bril-
liance and make us do weird, 
stupid shit like losing our voices 
by singing along on every cho-
rus and shouting “I love you!” 
at the musicians or completely 
forgetting ourselves while we 
dance. And if you were at the 
Sleater-Kinney show last week, 
think about the unique power of 
Brownstein, Tucker and Weiss 
and why you care about them 
enough to spend a night in their 
presence, and please try to figure 
out why you couldn’t smile or at 
least act engaged.

I know most concerts aren’t 

real conducive for going all-out 
“Saturday Night Fever” and 
clearing a huge space for yourself 
to show off on the dance floor, 
and I admit that I’m at a bit of 
an advantage compared to most. 
I can stand in place and just 

whip my long hair or do some 
sort of semi-coordinated arm 
movements and not feel too self-
conscious about it, but you don’t 
even have to move that much, 
especially if you’re at a lower-key, 
melancholy or acoustic show. I’m 
not saying you have to be sweat-
ing and out-of-breath after the 
show, just ready to crash into bed 
as soon as the last note ends, but 
you’re probably going to a concert 
because an artist’s music moves 
you in some way, and to share 
that with people, especially when 
you’re all packed in at a festival 
or a punk club, can be a really 
rewarding, memorable thing, 
especially when everyone does it 
all together.

And I get, too, that if you’re in 

your 30s or older, you may not be 
completely, religiously obsessed 
with music in the same way 
you were in college or earlier. 
I shudder just a bit at this ever 
happening to me, but I have to 
be honest with myself and say 
that a lot of the adults I saw at 
S-K weren’t all that superficially 
different from me with their pale 
faces and dark-rimmed glasses 
and unkempt hair. But I’m taking 
this Sleater show as a warning — 
even if responsibilities and work 
and the general stress of being a 
grown-up keep me from indulg-
ing myself with music as much as 
I do now, I can’t ever let myself 
treat having fun at a concert as a 
chore, and I can never let myself 
lose touch with the heart-burst-
ing happiness I feel whenever 
I’m at a wild show with unhinged 
music fans doing crazy shit.

So to the one girl who 

screeched “I fucking love this 
song!” while Brownstein was 
just tuning her guitar, to the 
guys scattered throughout who 
were furiously nodding their 
heads and even jumping up 
and down at times, I thank you 
for giving a shit. To the Arctic 
Monkeys fans who turned GA 
at The Fillmore into a whirlpool 
of bodies a couple years ago, to 
the people who threw at least 
five grams of weed onstage 
at a Schoolboy Q show, even 
to the oversexed couple who 
kept bumping into me at that 
Chance the Rapper show — to 
everyone who has helped turn 
the concerts I’ve gone into the 
bizarre explorations of human-
ity they’re meant to be, I wish 
you had been at Sleater-Kinney 
last week.

THEISEN

Viola Davis (“The Help”), Alfie 

Enoch (the “Harry Potter” series) 
and Matt McGorry (“Orange is the 
New Black”).

Just two years ago, Falahee was 

catering parties in New York. A 
year and a half ago, he led life in 
L.A. as a Lyft driver. Now 26 and 
home for the holidays, Falahee 
gets approached for a photo while 
browsing at Bivouac, and he and 
his family are still slightly in awe 
of the recognition that follows 
him. He has noted before how his 

big Italian family has a tradition 
of hand-rolling gnocchi, and this 
year is no different.

“I come from a really supportive 

family. But my grandma still jokes 
with me like, ‘When are you going 
to get a real job?’ ” he laughed.

With a whole week home, 

Falahee ate his way through his 
favorite local spots, remedying 
his flu with an Arbor Brewing 
Company draft. Despite being 
sick, he played football in the 
rain with old friends and cheered 
on Michigan against Ohio State 
in The Big House. He caught 
up on his reading list, which 
included 
Ta-Nehisi 
Coates’s 

“Between the World and Me,” 
Patti Smith’s “M Train” and Elon 
Musk’s biography. In multiple 
Instagrams, he documented his 
obsession with the Settlers of 
Catan board game, of which he 
raved, “I mean, have you played? 
It’s incredible!”

Well-read and proudly nerdy, 

Falahee is the third child of four 
in a very academic family. His 
younger brother, Michael, whom 
he enjoys playing the guitar with, 
graduated pre-med from the 
University last May. His older 
sister, a lawyer, saved him and his 
“Murder” castmates from relying 
on “Legally Blonde” to learn 
courtroom jargon.

In his senior year of high 

school, 
Falahee 
dual-enrolled 

at Pioneer High School to join 
their Theatre Guild (PTG), which 
School of Music, Theatre & Dance 
students help instruct. When one 
of his student teachers pulled him 

aside and asked if he’d consider 
doing theatre at a collegiate level, 
Falahee decided to seriously 
audition around the country.

While he may not have been 

accepted 
to 
the 
University’s 

School of Music, Theatre and 
Dance, he graduated from New 
York 
University’s 
prestigious 

Tisch drama program in 2011.

“I went from being this guy 

who played sports in high school 
to taking a ballet class in New 
York City,” he said.

However, Falahee reflected 

on the value of pursuing acting 
through higher education.

“I think there was definitely 

a lot I learned in college, I got 
a lot of experience I wouldn’t 
have,” 
Falahee 
said. 
“But 

especially since we invest so 
much in academia now, the 
amount we pay to go to NYU 
… I don’t know.” Nevertheless, 
he justified that it was less the 
university experience and more 
being in “the center of the world,” 
surrounded by theaters in New 
York City, that influenced him 
most as a performer.

In fact, while at NYU, he 

saw Viola Davis and Denzel 
Washington 
co-star 
in 
the 

Broadway 
revival 
of 
August 

Wilson’s play “Fences.” Little 
did he know, he’d one day find 
a maternal figure in Davis, and 
Washington would one day listen 
in on his table read.

Now, it’s no secret (unless just 

an elaborate social media cover-up) 
that the entire “Murder” cast has 
become a close family. Falahee told 

me about a continuous prank on set.

“I know, I get to watch Viola 

Davis act in front of me, but 
when it’s the same two pages 
for 14 hours, it’s exhausting,” he 
said. “So Matt (McGorry) and I 
have this thing where we try to 
make each other laugh during 
the serious court room scenes … 
Alfie (Enoch) and I are holding 
it in, biting our lips to the point 
of self-harm. Aja (Naomi King) 
is over there falling asleep. It’s 
hilarious.”

Then, when asked about his 

“bromance” 
with 
“Murder” 

co-star McGorry, Falahee was 
quick to respond: “Oh yeah, it’s a 
real romance.”

Their playful friendship and 

teasing on social media translates 
to real life as well.

“Matt’s just so funny. We’ll get 

together sometimes and just read 
Shakespeare to exercise different 
muscles,” he said. “He’ll send 
me these emails that are written 
entirely in iambic pentameter.”

Along 
with 
admiring 
his 

co-stars, 
Falahee’s 
acting 

inspirations constantly change 
as he matures as an actor. Most 
recently, he has been fascinated 
with Tom Hardy (“Mad Max: 
Fury Road”).

“I go through these phases 

where I have an obsession with 
one actor,” he explained. “I’ll just 
watch everything they’ve ever 
been in.”

In 
addition 
to 
“Murder,” 

Falahee plays Frank Stringfellow 
in “Mercy Street,” a new PBS 
original series about the American 

Civil War to premiere on Jan. 17 — 
a show Falahee detailed extremely 
passionately. His own fascination 
with the Civil War started when 
his father took him and his two 
brothers to visit Gettysburg when 
they were younger.

“I 
never 
thought 
I’d 
be 

spending 
half 
my 
year 
in 

Richmond (Virginia)” he said. 
“But (the show is) so relevant 
to 
everything 
that’s 
been 

happening in the world right now 
… race relations between African 
Americans and whites.”

In 
thinking 
about 
future 

projects, Falahee noted how he 
would love to eventually return to 
musical theater, which he started 
with in the PTG. He recently 
saw “Hamilton” on Broadway 
and “Elf the Musical” while back 
home, but he laments his crazy 
filming schedule for having little 
time to see more shows. A lover 
of animation and the “Toy Story” 
series, Falahee’s other dream role 
would be a cartoon character.

Though he has become very 

well-adjusted in the Hollywood 
spotlight, Falahee has one piece 
of advice for up-and-coming 
actors — a note taken from Matt 
Damon: “Don’t do it.”

“I know it sounds funny, but 

I’m being serious,” he said. “I 
realize how privileged I am to be 
where I am, but you have to be a 
little crazy and insane to pursue 
it.”

To be successful, to be on a 

show titled “How to Get Away 
with Murder,” I guess you have to 
be at least a little mad.

ALMOST GREAT
SMOOTH SAILING

n Even without Spike Albrecht, 

Michigan coasted to an easy win 

over Delaware State. Page 4B

A guard, a grandpa 
and the end of an era 
W

hen Frank Brunski 
Jr. passed away on 
Sept. 1, 2012, he left 

behind a wife of 50 years, three 
children, 10 grandchildren, one 
great-grandchild and a legacy of 
hard work.

One of those grandchildren 

— Spike Albrecht — 
adopted that hard 
work ethic.

Frank was a 

lifelong Hoosier. He 
was born in Gary, 
Ind., in 1938 and 
stayed put in that area 
his whole life. For 43 
years, he worked as 
a bricklayer in the 
steel mills of Indiana. 
You could count the 
number of days he missed work 
on one hand. He missed even 
fewer of his grandchildren’s 

sporting events.

“He was unbelievable,” 

Albrecht recalled. “He came to 
everything. He was the grandpa 
that was so supportive and 
bragged about me, thought I was 
the best thing since sliced bread. 
That’s how our relationship was. 
We got along great.”

Watching Grandpa Frank, 

Spike learned a thing or two 
about hard work. When Spike 

was a senior in high 
school, Frank came over 
and built a deck for his 
family’s pool.

Spike embodied that 

sense of hard work and 
determination. He went 
from having no college 
basketball offers after 
graduating high school 
to a full-ride scholarship 
to Michigan a year later, 
after playing one season 

in prep school.

When Grandpa Frank passed 

away the week before Albrecht 

started classes at Michigan, he 
kept quiet about it. It tore him up 
on the inside, but he had a college 
basketball career to begin — one 
most people never thought he 
would have.

“I never wanted people to feel 

sorry for me or anything like 
that,” Albrecht said. “But it was 
something that was just tough to 
deal with.”

That’s Spike. He doesn’t want 

to talk about himself. He doesn’t 
want your sympathy. He just 
wants to do his thing and go home.

So Friday — when he 

announced that due to injuries 
he would end his career with 
Michigan — he was out of his 
comfort zone. He was forced to 
talk about himself, his time at 
Michigan and his future.

Asked about his legacy, he 

paused.

“That’s a tough question. I 

don’t like talking about myself,” 
Albrecht said. “I think that I 
showed people you can’t ever let 

someone tell you what you can or 
can’t do. You know, my whole life 
I was told I wasn’t good enough, 
I wasn’t big enough, I wasn’t 
strong enough, fast enough — 
things like that. But I never really 
let that faze me. And I always just 
tried to go out there and prove 
people wrong.”

For three and half years, that’s 

what he did at Michigan. He 
proved people wrong. His legacy 
won’t be in his stat line, it’ll be in 
everything you don’t see in the 
box score.

Forget the 17 points in the 

National Championship Game 
in 2012. Forget the postgame 
tweet to Kate Upton. Forget the 
acrobatic pass to Aubrey Dawkins 
against Illinois in the Big Ten 
Tournament last year. Forget the 
3s from deep, the circus passes 
and the gritty defense.

Remember this: With Michigan 

up 19 points in the second half 
against Houston Baptist last 
Saturday, Albrecht hit the deck 

in an attempt to get a loose-ball 
rebound. The ball went out of 
bounds and Albrecht slapped the 
floor with his right hand.

Michigan didn’t need that 

rebound — it went on to win, 
82-57 — but Albrecht wanted it. 
So, with 12:10 left in the route of 
the Huskies, Albrecht laid out, 
new hips be damned. 

Remember this: During 

Michigan’s Final Four run 
his freshman year, he was 
simultaneously working on a 
group project for school. He 
never missed a meeting or an 
assignment. His group got an A.

Remember this: When he 

comes home from Michigan, he 
goes into his mom’s second-grade 
class and reads to her students. 
Spike Albrecht — Michigan 
basketball royalty — hangs out 
with second graders when he 
goes home.

And most importantly, 

remember this: Spike Albrecht 
cared. He cared when he hit the 

deck for loose balls, when he’d 
smile with a fan for a photo and 
when he went back home and sat 
in a second-grade classroom.

There was never an ego with 

Spike. He was never bigger than 
the game. And because of that, in 
Spike, we saw ourselves. He was 
the little engine that could, and 
with him on the court, anything 
was possible.

He left Michigan the same 

way he came into the program, 
with humility and gratitude.

After his press conference 

Friday, he got up from his 
seat, pushed his chair back in, 
shook a few hands and — as 
he walked out the door — said 
thank you to everyone.

With the help of a work ethic 

he learned from his grandpa, 
Spike Albrecht made his dream 
come true.

Grandpa Frank never got to 

see him play college basketball, 
but he would have been damn 
proud if he had.

Albrecht ends career amid injuries

By LEV FACHER

Managing Editor

Everything 
about 
Spike 

Albrecht’s career at Michigan was 
unexpected — even the ending.

The senior guard came to Ann 

Arbor after receiving offers from 
no other Big Ten schools. Prior 
to an offer from Michigan coach 
John Beilein, he had considered 
playing basketball at Appalachian 
State or becoming a “rec-league 
star” at Indiana.

Then, as a true freshman, 

he scored 17 points in the 2013 
National Championship Game. 
He became known to coaches 
and fans alike as a “baby-faced 
assassin.” For the last two years, 
he has served as the Wolverines’ 
de facto team spokesman.

But 
it’s 
over. 
Albrecht’s 

time with the Michigan men’s 
basketball team — always fun 
to watch, often surreal, rarely 
straightforward — came to an 
end Thursday, when he informed 
Beilein of his decision to sit out the 
rest of the season as he continues 
to recover from a pair of offseason 
hip surgeries, thereby ending his 
career as a Wolverine.

“We’d been doing everything 

we can for the past two months,” 
Albrecht said Friday. “It had just 
been progressing and getting 
worse, so I think it was finally 
time to shut it down.”

Albrecht had played only 

sparingly this season, recording 
11 assists, 15 points and 69 
minutes over the span of eight 
games. Beilein had said earlier 
in the season that Albrecht 
was available only for “spot 
minutes,” but with junior guard 
Derrick Walton Jr. suffering 
a sprained ankle in Dec. 1 at 
North Carolina State, Albrecht’s 
presence became more of a 
necessity than a luxury.

But Albrecht wasn’t in game 

shape in the second half on 
Tuesday at Southern Methodist. 
Though he has endured near-
constant pain in his hips for the 
better part of two seasons, the 
way he felt in Texas may have 
been the straw that broke the 
camel’s back.

“I was actually worried that I 

would pull a groin or re-tear my 

labrum,” Albrecht said. “That’s 
how bad it was out there. If that’s 
how I was going to have to get 
through my senior year, it just 
wasn’t worth it.” 

Albrecht had previously told 

Beilein that he was was available 
for bench minutes at “60 to 70 
percent” health, but as long-term 
health concerns became more 
tangible, the mindset changed.

Beilein likened the injuries to 

a concussion — one that doesn’t 
physically prevent an athlete 
from playing, but that poses 
massive health risk if not given 
the proper time and attention 
required to heal.

“He’s going to have children, 

he’s going to have grandchildren,” 
Beilein said. “Your hips are pretty 
important to you.”

Albrecht’s family considerations 

don’t just pertain to the future. 

“It’s a genetic thing,” Albrecht 

said. “My dad has really bad hips. 
He needs two hip replacements. 
I sure as hell didn’t want to go 
down that road. … I’m not saying 
that it could have gotten there, 
but you never know.”

While 
Albrecht’s 
absence 

shakes up Michigan’s roster in a 
big way, there are still a few things 
that won’t change. Albrecht will 
attend practices, he’ll be on the 
bench at games (dressed in street 
clothes), and he’ll travel with 
the team unless circumstances 
(namely, academics) make road 
trips burdensome.

What does change, however, 

is Michigan’s rotation. Albrecht’s 
absence, 
alongside 
Walton’s, 

doesn’t just deprive the Wolverines 
of two of their upperclassmen 
leaders — it leaves a gaping hole at 
the point guard position.

To spell sophomore guard 

Muhammad-Ali Abdur-Rahkman, 
junior guard Andrew Dakich is 
burning his redshirt, and will be 
available for the Wolverines on 
Saturday against Delaware State, 
likely off the bench.

Dakich is likely experiencing a 

degree of déja vu as he reshapes 
his mentality. This is the second 
consecutive year he has entered 
expecting to redshirt in order to 
preserve a fifth year of eligibility, 
either 
at 
Michigan 
or 
with 

another program. But as was the 
case in 2014-15, circumstantial 
changes have called him into 
action. Last year, it was injuries 
to Walton and then-junior guard 
Caris LeVert that brought Dakich 
off the bench. Now, it’s injuries to 
Walton and Albrecht, along with 
recent ones Beilein declined to 
disclose Friday.

This time, one of those absences 

is permanent.

Asked Friday what his lasting 

legacy at Michigan would be, 
Albrecht 
paused, 
immediately 

remarking that he doesn’t like 
talking about himself. In the end, 
he offered up a pearl of wisdom 
that 
epitomizes 
his 
unlikely 

career as well as any other.

“I think I showed people that 

you can’t ever let someone tell 
you what you can or can’t do,” 
Albrecht said. “My whole life, I’ve 
been told I wasn’t good enough, I 
wasn’t big enough, I wasn’t strong 
enough, I wasn’t fast enough, 
things like that. But I never really 
let that faze me. I guess: Always 
try to go out there and prove 
people wrong.”

Young lineup 
looks strong

By COLE ZINGAS

Daily Sports Writer

Michigan men’s gymnastics 

coach Kurt Golder said Sunday 
he doesn’t expect this season to 
match what has transpired in 
the last four. The Wolverines are 
preparing for their season opener 
next month, but the void left by 
the senior class is just too big to 
fill, he said. 

“Not this year,” Golder said. 

“They were too good. But we can 
progress a long way to get to that.”

The 
Michigan 
men’s 

gymnastics team has been good 
for a while. After capturing two 
national titles in the last three 
years, the graduating senior class 
left a gaping hole in the program. 
The 
fifth-ranked 
Wolverines 

return just seven out of 25 routines 
from their lineup from the NCAA 
Championships last season.

Yet even after losing athletes 

like NCAA All-American junior 
Tristan 
Perez-Rivera 
for 
the 

season to a knee injury, the team 
is full of energy and has high 
aspirations for the season.

Michigan welcomes a strong 

recruiting class — 15 freshmen 
made their debuts at the annual 
Maize-Blue intrasquad exhibition 
on Sunday, as fans peered in to see 
if this Wolverine squad could rely 
on such a young roster.

The first-year Wolverines did 

nothing to give anyone reason to 
doubt their abilities. Five out of 
the six highest-scoring gymnasts 
were freshmen.

This class features redshirt 

freshman Marty Stretch and 
true freshmen Emyre Cole and 
Anthony McCallum, none of whom 
are strangers to the spotlight.

Stretch has been a member of 

the U.S. National Team since 2011, 
and placed second overall at the 
USA Championships in 2013. Cole 
and McCallum have also competed 
on the national level — Cole won 
the U.S. National Qualifier in 2015, 
and McCallum placed first in the 

floor and vault at the 2015 Junior 
National Championships. 

But 
Cole, 
like 
his 
coach, 

recognizes the freshmen have 
work to do.

“We mess up sometimes,” he 

said. “But hey, we’re freshmen.”

Though 
there 
might 
be 

a 
learning 
curve 
for 
these 

freshmen, Golder continues to be 
impressed by their talent. One of 
the highlights of Sunday’s meet 
featured McCallum performing 
and landing an extremely difficult 
vault exercise, earning him a score 
of 15.3, the highest single-event 
score of the day.

“There’s only a few people 

in the world that are capable of 
doing that vault,” Golder said. 
“It wasn’t a surprise because he’s 
been doing it in the gym really 
well, but doing it in competition … 
that’s another thing.”

This is Golder’s youngest team 

in his 20-year tenure at Michigan, 
but he hopes this team can reach 
its potential in the upcoming 
months. For him, that means 
finishing top six nationally and top 
three in the Big Ten. 

One 
person 
who 
quickly 

figured out how to make an impact 
as a freshman is All-American 
sophomore Dmitri Belanovski, 
who in his first year was named 
team MVP and led the 2015 
squad to a spot at the NCAA 
Championships. 
Belanovski’s 

performance on Sunday did not 
reveal any signs of slowing down. 
He won the meet with an overall 
score of 84.4.

Belanovski 
was 
placed 

alongside Cole on the 2016 Big Ten 
Men’s Gymnasts to Watch list. 
Though Belanovski was expected 
to be listed, Cole was pleasantly 
surprised by the honor and says 
he will use it as motivation in 
upcoming meets. 

Cole said his ultimate goal 

for 2016 is being named Big Ten 
Freshman of the Year. Many of 
his competitors for the award are 
wearing the same colors.

Michigan comes close, but not close enough

J

T Compher skated down 
the ice, passed the Michi-
gan hockey team’s bench 

and angrily 
smacked his 
stick against 
the boards 
on the other 
side. He then 
put his gloves 
on his knees 
and his head 
down. A few 
seconds later, 
freshman 
defenseman 
Nicholas Boka did the same thing.

About 10 seconds earlier, 

Compher ended up with the 
puck in his possession and no 
one between him and Minnesota 
goaltender Eric Schierhorn. In 
the waning seconds of Saturday’s 
series finale at Yost Ice Arena — 
after the Wolverines rolled Friday 
night, 8-3 — Compher couldn’t 
put it past Schierhorn for the 
equalizer. Instead, the Golden 
Gophers pulled out a 3-2 win to 
split the series.

That was how most of the night 

went. Michigan peppered 33 
shots at Schierhorn, converting on 
just two. Friday, the Wolverines 
had 10 shots in 35 minutes, and 
everything went in. They knocked 
Schierhorn out after five goals.

Every weekend, Michigan 

seems to have one of each kind of 
night. Some nights, the pucks go 
in. Some nights, they don’t.

Of course, the Wolverines win 

all the time when they’re getting 
the bounces. They have done 
it even in the past three years, 
despite missing three straight 
NCAA Tournaments.

What they couldn’t manage to 

do Saturday was win when the 
pucks weren’t going in, no matter 
how close they were — and they 
were very close.

Michigan put itself in a 2-0 

hole at the end of the first period, 
but for the No. 1 scoring team in 

the country, that’s nothing. At the 
11:53 mark in the second period, 
freshman forward Kyle Connor 
scored his fourth goal of the series 
to cut the deficit in half.

“We’re reminding our team 

constantly — you just can’t bury 
your head and give up because 
the game’s not going the way you 
want it to,” said Michigan coach 
Red Berenson after practice 
Tuesday. “You have to be resilient, 
and then you have to come up 
with a strategy, or an attitude, or 
something, that’s going to change 
the momentum of the game if you 
need a change.”

Connor’s goal could have 

been the spark that started the 
Wolverines’ comeback. Instead, 19 
seconds later, junior defenseman 
Michael Downing laid a crushing 
hit on a Minnesota player, earned 
a five-minute major penalty and 

was ejected from the game. He 
stayed on the ice for a moment, 
arguing with one official while 
another held him back. Compher 
pleaded his case, too. Berenson 
called the ruling “disappointing.”

It was no 

use. Downing 
was out, and 
Michigan was 
behind. Things 
weren’t going 
right.

But the 

Wolverines 
fought back. 
They stifled 
Minnesota 
on the five-minute penalty kill. 
Halfway through, they cleared the 
puck and changed lines as the Yost 
crowd let out a loud cheer. With a 
minute remaining, they did it again. 
Finally, they killed off the penalty.

Michigan came out for the 

third period still behind by only 
a goal, and 94 seconds into the 
final frame, Connor gave the 
Wolverines another boost. He 
stood on the weak side of the net 

and awaited 
a loose puck, 
and on the 
third effort he 
slipped it past 
the goalie.

At that 

point, 
Michigan 
had done 
everything it 
doesn’t always 

do when things aren’t going 
well. It played defense, killing 
off the penalty. It capitalized on 
its chances, scoring on the third 
effort. And it stayed in a rare 
low-scoring game long enough 

for the breaks to come.

With more than 18 minutes 

left, there was still plenty of time. 
But the break never came.

Instead, Minnesota came 

out of the ensuing faceoff and 
scored in 12 seconds. Forward 
Vinni Lettieri knocked a wrist 
shot past Michigan junior 
goaltender Zach Nagelvoort, 
and the Wolverines were in a 
hole again, this time one they 
couldn’t climb out of.

“That’s not a good goal to give 

up, and the timing couldn’t have 
been worse,” Berenson said. “We 
just bounced back, and all of a 
sudden that was a big goal for 
them, and a really disappointing 
goal for us.”

More often than not, they 

find their way out of that hole. 
They have the top scoring 
offense in the country for a 

reason, and usually, that’s good 
enough. Friday, they scored in 
the first 16 seconds — before 
the clock was even set on 
the scoreboard at Yost. They 
cruised from there, scoring 
every which way in a high-
scoring victory.

In a down Big Ten, there will 

be at least one of those every 
weekend. (There were two last 
weekend against Wisconsin.) The 
Wolverines have the firepower to 
win those games.

A team with a great offense 

and an average defense that 
wins 8-3 games will win enough 
games in the regular season 
and the Big Ten Tournament 
to reach the conference final. 
It will have a chance to make 
the NCAA Tournament, like 
Michigan did last season, before 
it lost to Minnesota in the Big 
Ten Championship, 4-2. The 
Wolverines proved Friday they 
can be that team.

But when they killed off the 

five-minute penalty, and then 
scored the game-tying goal 
Saturday, they almost proved 
they can be so much more. They 
almost proved they could win a 
3-2 or 4-3 game, one that will be 
much more common in March.

“We had good shots. We had 

good chances. We had just about, 
and woulda, coulda, shoulda, but 
we couldn’t find the back of the 
net,” Berenson said.

That’s why Compher slapped 

the boards at the end of the game 
after he missed the potential 
game-tying shot. He knew what 
was at stake.

The Wolverines know they can 

win when everything is going 
right. What they have to do, 
and what they keep getting ever 
so close to doing, is win when 
everything isn’t.

‘M’ starts series with win 

By KEVIN SANTO

Daily Sports Writer

Thirty seconds had ticked off 

the clock at Yost Ice Arena, and 
the game was already tied at one.

Welcome to Michigan hockey.
The Wolverines opened the 

scoring 
16 

seconds into 
the 
frame, 

when junior 
forward Tyler Motte fired a slap 
shot into the bottom-right corner 
of the net. It was a start Michigan 
only could have dreamed of in its 
rematch with Minnesota — the 
team that dashed the Wolverines’ 
hopes of making the NCAA 
Tournament last March.

But 
their 
excitement 
was 

short-lived.

Just 
14 
seconds 
later, 

Minnesota 
forward 
Hudson 

Fasching responded with a goal of 
his own to even the score at one.

From 
there, 
the 
scoring 

continued like it has all year at 
Yost Ice Arena, as No. 9 Michigan 
cruised to an 8-3 victory against 
Minnesota behind a three-goal 
surge in the second period.

“(The scoring), it’s not all 

confidence,” said Michigan coach 
Red Berenson. “We’re putting 
our chances in. Sometimes it goes 
in too easy, and maybe this was 
one of those nights. (Minnesota) 
will be better tomorrow, and we 
have to be better. We have to go 
home now and put this game 
behind us, which is hard to do 
because everybody is going to be 
talking to our players about how 
good they were.”

Thanks to sophomore forward 

Dexter Dancs — who picked up a 
loose puck after a scrum in front of 
the net and found twine from the 
top of the crease 6:30 into the first 
frame — the Wolverines (2-0-1-1 
Big Ten, 9-2-3 overall) ended the 
first period with a 2-1 advantage.

After Dancs’ finish, the frame 

was surprisingly quiet compared 
to its opening.

Michigan effectively prevented 

Minnesota from setting up in 

the offensive zone, limiting the 
Golden Gophers (2-1-0-0, 6-8-0) 
to just four shots.

The 
handful 
of 
times 

that Minnesota did have an 
opportunity to establish itself, 
though, 
the 
Golden 
Gophers 

looked dangerous — passing well 
and getting quality shots on junior 
goaltender Zach Nagelvoort.

Nagelvoort was good enough 

throughout 
the 
game 
for 

Michigan to hold down the 
victory, accumulating 22 saves on 
25 shots. At times, the netminder 
committed costly turnovers and 
made questionable decisions. 
But he conceded only one goal 
in the first 10 minutes of the 
second period, when Minnesota 
peppered the net with shots.

The Golden Gophers opened 

the 
frame 
with 
newfound 

energy 
and 
buried 
the 

equalizing goal off the stick of 
forward Tyler Sheehy.

The Wolverines ensured that 

energy wouldn’t last too long.

Michigan 
responded 
with 

three 
unanswered 
goals, 

the first of which came in a 
spectacular fashion from senior 
center Boo Nieves.

Nieves picked up the puck 

at the defensive blue line and 
went on a tear down the ice, 
leaving Minnesota defensemen 
dumbfounded in his wake. The 
veteran 
deked 
three 
Golden 

Gophers before finishing it over 
goaltender 
Eric 
Schierhorn’s 

shoulder to give the Wolverines a 
3-2 lead.

“That was huge,” Berenson 

said. “It’s an individual effort, but 
when (Nieves) got through their 
defense and scored, you could just 
feel that pick our team up. Sure 
enough, we scored the next shift, 
and away we went.

“I have always thought he’s a 

better player than he thought he 
was, and I think he’s gonna live up 
to my expectations.”

After Nieves’ one-man show, 

freshman forward Kyle Connor 
buried Minnesota in an even 
deeper hole. The rookie tacked on 

a goal of his own just 15 seconds 
after Nieves did by putting a 
rebound from junior forward 
Tyler Motte’s shot into the net. 

Connor wouldn’t be stopped 

there, either, as he lit the lamp for 
the second time just over three 
minutes later.

After allowing his fifth goal 

of the night, Schierhorn was 
replaced by sophomore Nick 
Lehr. 
Roughly 
two 
minutes 

after 
the 
change, 
Fasching 

finally stopped the bleeding for 
Minnesota, scoring his second 
goal of the night to cut Michigan’s 
lead to two.

Though the Golden Gophers 

suffered the same fate as most 
teams do when faced with stopping 
the Wolverines’ explosive offense, 
they did improve offensively in 
the second frame themselves — 
outshooting Michigan 11-9.

But 
that 
was 
simply 
a 

consolation prize for Minnesota, 
as the two-goal deficit was the 

closest the Golden Gophers came 
for the rest of the contest.

Motte and junior center Max 

Shuart rubbed salt in Minnesota’s 
wound 2:44 and 13:51 into the 
third period, respectively. The pair 
combined to score the Wolverines’ 
first two goals of the frame, before 
Connor completed his hat trick 
with 3:10 left on the clock.

The Golden Gophers entered 

Yost Ice Arena having ended 
Michigan’s season in the Big 
Ten Tournament last year. And 
the Wolverines had to wait eight 
months to get what they have 
wanted since that moment.

“It’s tough not making the 

tournament since we’ve been 
here,” Nieves said. “But this 
season’s definitely looking up, and 
we want to keep it going.”

And behind the offense that 

just keeps on scoring, Michigan 
gave itself a new memory of the 
Golden Gophers it is sure to be 
fond of.

Michigan splits series after 
lapse in Saturday’s contest

By JASON RUBINSTEIN

Daily Sports Editor

Diagnosing 
the 
Michigan 

hockey 
team’s 
identity 
has 

become nearly impossible.

Are 
the 

Wolverines 
a team that 
can 
erase 

three-goal leads at the snap 
of a finger? Or are they a team 
that will allow three-plus goals 
in a single period? What about 
nights where the nation’s top 
offense can muster only one goal 
against a much-lesser opponent 
in Dartmouth?

No one really knows the 

anatomy 
of 
the 
Wolverines 

(2-1-1-1 Big Ten, 9-3-3 overall). 
Even this far into the season. 
And not much is clearer after 
Michigan’s 3-2 loss to Minnesota 
on Saturday.

“Minnesota played with more 

conviction, they played harder and 

they got the lead,” said Michigan 
coach Red Berenson. “When they 
got that second goal, that was a 
higher hill to climb than maybe 
its been in previous weeks, and we 
just couldn’t climb it.”

Heading 
in 
to 
Saturday’s 

contest, Michigan couldn’t have 
felt comfortable. Even after putting 
up a snowball against the Gophers 
(3-1-0-0, 7-8-0) the night before 
— winning 8-3 — the past had to 
cross the Wolverines’ minds.

“Some nights the puck goes 

in too easy,” Berenson said on 
Friday, “and maybe this was one 
of those nights.”

Berenson’s 
comment 

stems from his team’s past 
performances during the second 
leg of a home series. Six weeks 
ago on Friday, Michigan came 
from two goals behind to beat 
Robert Morris, 5-3, before losing 
on Saturday, 4-0. Three weeks 
ago on Friday, the Wolverines 
dismantled 
Dartmouth, 
7-0, 

before coasting to a 1-1 tie a day 
later. And last Friday, Michigan 
erased a three-goal deficit to beat 
Wisconsin, 6-4, before tying the 
same team 6-6 the next night.

And 
Berenson’s 
sentiment 

held true on Saturday.

“Last night, it was going in too 

easy, I told you,” Berenson said. 
“And tonight, it was not going in.”

The Wolverines, who have 

come out with strong starts 
the previous two weekends, 
struggled to find any semblance 
of offense in the first frame. 
And unlike the night before, 
Minnesota had no trouble doing 
the opposite.

Jake 
Bischoff 
opened 
the 

night’s scoring on the Golden 
Gophers’ first power-play chance. 
The 
defenseman 
rifled 
one 

from the blue line, and junior 
netminder Zach Nagelvoort never 
saw the puck. It didn’t take long 
for Bischoff to be heavily involved 
in a scoring play for a second time. 

Three minutes later, like he did 
on his first tally, Bischoff found 
the puck at the top of the slot and 
fired it toward the net. Forward 
Hudson 
Fasching, 
who 
was 

screening Nagelvoort, ultimately 
redirected the puck home.

And just when it seemed 

like Michigan had any sort of 
momentum 
when 
freshman 

Kyle 
Connor 
scored 
with 

seven minutes left in the first 
period, 
junior 
defenseman 

Michael Downing was ejected 
after laying a massive hit on 
Minnesota 
forward 
Connor 

Reilly. Berenson wasn’t pleased 
with 
the 
referees’ 
decision, 

calling the call “disappointing.”

Michigan was able to kill 

the five-minute penalty, but 
those were five minutes the 
Wolverines 
couldn’t 
pester 

netminder Eric Schierhorn, who 
was pulled Friday.

It looked like Michigan would 

have control of the game, and all 
of the momentum, early in the 
third period when Connor scored 
his second goal of the game — his 
fifth of the series. And that had 
Berenson smiling.

“He’s really, really starting 

to find himself now,” Berenson 
said. “I’ve always thought that 
freshmen usually take about half a 
year in, and then after Christmas 
they take off. And he’s starting to 
take off, so good for him.”

But Berenson’s smile quickly 

turned the other way on the very 
next shift when forward Vinni 
Lettieri put one past Nagelvoort 
on a point-blank chance.

“When they got that goal, 

the timing could not have been 
worse,” Berenson said.

Lettieri’s tally sealed the game 

and for the fourth straight home 
series, Michigan was unable to 
complete a weekend sweep.

So for now, the trend of 

Michigan 
playing 
sloppy 

Saturday games will continue 
and the opportunity to sing 
“The Victors” — a tradition after 
sweeping a series — will have to 
wait until 2016.

Red Berenson lamented that his team has had trouble stringing together consecutive solid performances in weekend series.

Eliminating head 
contact in hockey

By JUSTIN MEYER

Daily Sports Writer

With eight minutes to play 

in the second period of the 
Michigan hockey team’s game 
Saturday night, junior forward 
JT Compher stood at center 
ice flailing his arms in an 
animated fashion at the official. 
Another referee pushed Michael 
Downing toward the exit behind 
Michigan’s net while the junior 
defenseman hollered at the rest 
of the officiating crew.

It was a scene that college 

hockey 
fans 
have 
become 

familiar with.

The loudspeaker announced 

the call — contact to the head 
— and Downing received an 
automatic five-minute major and 
game misconduct penalty. The 
Wolverines’ defensive rock was 
tossed mid-comeback.

Minnesota won the game, 3-2, 

splitting the weekend series.

The advent of concussion 

research brought forth a variety 
of suggestions for reducing 
dangerous hits in contact sports. 
Today, automatic ejections are 
in vogue.

Division I football reached 

its own apex of controversy 
this season with hard-to-define 
targeting rules. In football, a 
player is automatically ejected 
for “contact to the head or neck 
area of a defenseless opponent.” 
Senior linebacker Joe Bolden 
was the subject of such a call 
during the Michigan football 
team’s loss to Michigan State 
this season.

While the targeting rule has 

been widely lambasted for a lack of 
clarity, the success of the contact-
to-the-head rule in NCAA hockey 
is still up for debate.

Positive signs include year-

over-year declines in penalty 
minutes at the Division I level. 
Also comforting is the evidence 
of a rapid return to a normal rate 
of game misconduct penalties. 
When the NHL adjusted its 
rulebook, it saw a dramatic 
spike for only one year — about 
30 percent in 2010 — before 
settling back to historically 
normal levels.

But some still feel that the 

penalty doesn’t fit the crime.

It’s 
unfair 
to 
say 
that 

Downing’s ejection was the 
reason Michigan lost. Instead, 
it seemed to light a fire under 
the Wolverines, who killed off 
the long penalty and eventually 
evened the score at 2-2.

But it would also be wrong 

to deny the significance of 
the call, which left Michigan 
with just five defensemen and 
required 
junior 
defenseman 

Nolan De Jong to play in extra-
attacker scenarios.

Michigan coach Red Berenson 

said after the game that the call 
was “disappointing.” The players 
didn’t use it as an excuse.

But was the game better off 

because of the dramatic call?

Minnesota 
was 
flat-out 

embarrassed Friday night to 
open 
the 
series. 
Freshman 

goaltender 
Eric 
Schierhorn 

posted an abysmal .667 save 
percentage, and the Gophers 
looked 
helpless 
as 
the 

Wolverines piled on eight goals.

Saturday, 
Minnesota 
was 

determined not to get pushed 
around.

Both teams came out hard in 

a game that featured 31 penalty 
minutes. In the early going, the 
contest was a sluggish affair 
because of sloppy passing and 
physical play in the corners. 
Bodies flew, the boards rattled 
and several hits took the breath 
out of the crowd.

For the most part, though, the 

refs were lenient when sending 
players to the box. It’s what 
made the Downing ejection 
such a surprise 
— the offending 

hit certainly wasn’t the worst of 
the game.

Downing himself went to 

the box earlier for breaking his 
stick on a slash across the back 
of a Minnesota player — a minor 
penalty 
was 
assessed. 
Later, 

the 
normally 
mild-mannered 

senior 
forward 
Boo 
Nieves 

took a Golden Gopher player to 
the ground following a cross-
checking bonanza in front of the 
net. Nieves received a two-minute 
minor as well.

Either offense might have 

warranted a more costly penalty, 
but 
Downing’s 
head 
contact 

penalty was the one that changed 
the game.

The NCAA updated the rule 

before the 2010-11 season. A few 
months 
later, 
Sidney 
Crosby 

sustained a concussion that would 
keep him out of the NHL for close 
to a year. That injury made rules 
of this sort more palatable, and 
may have permanently changed 
the conversation on concussions 
in the sport.

Downing 
received 
his 

game misconduct for a hit on 
Minnesota’s Connor Reilly. The 
replay makes apparent that, 
in the process of going for the 
big hit, Downing connected 
with Reilly’s head in an illegal 
manner. Reilly was shaken up for 
a second, but climbed gingerly 
to his feet and finished the game 
without any visible symptoms.

It was an awkward hit in 

which 
Michigan’s 
enforcer 

appeared to miss his mark 
due to last-second movement. 
Detractors would argue the 
game misconduct penalty was 
intended for use on a malicious 
play, not a questionable hit.

Downing has had trouble 

in this area before. He was 
suspended 
three 
times 
last 

season, earning him an extra-
game suspension as a repeat 
offender. Two weeks ago, while 
talking about his timing on big 
hits, he said he was working to 
stay on the ice this year.

But with automatic ejections, 

trying just isn’t good enough.

MEN’S BASKETBALL
Lineup shake-up 
sparks Michigan

By KELLY HALL

Daily Sports Writer

Michigan coach John Beilein 

started off his Friday press 
conference with bad news, just 
not the kind Michigan fans had 
anticipated. 
After 
mentioning 

that junior guard Derrick Walton 
Jr. still hadn’t practiced more 
than a week after suffering 
an ankle sprain against North 
Carolina State, Beilein made note 
of more injuries that had been 
sustained just that day in practice. 

Then came the news the 

Wolverine faithful already knew: 
Senior guard and captain Spike 
Albrecht would be retiring from 
the Michigan basketball team 
due to his slow recovery from 
offseason hip surgeries. 

Despite injuries and rotation 

changes that included redshirt 
sophomore 
guard 
Duncan 

Robinson replacing sophomore 
Aubrey Dawkins in the starting 
lineup, the Wolverines (7-3) 
exceeded expectations against 
winless 
Delaware 
State 
on 

Saturday, 
clobbering 
the 

Hornets, 80-33.

There weren’t any transitional 

issues for Robinson, who got on 
the board first with a 3-pointer 
after being left open on the wing. 
He went on to score 11 points on 
4-for-6 shooting, validating his 
new status as a starter.

“We feel right now, that our 

flow, defensively and offensively, 
is better as a starter for Duncan,” 
Beilein said. “Get him in there 
and let him go and get more 
scorers out there. … I think he 
makes other guys better.”

Robinson dished out four of 

the Wolverines’ season-high 23 
assists. After the Wolverines 
tallied just 12 in their loss to 
Southern 
Methodist, 
Beilein 

made sharing the ball a point of 
emphasis in practice. 

Starting Robinson takes more 

pressure off of senior guard 
Caris LeVert, who leads both the 
scoring and assists categories. 

“He opens up the floor because 

he’s such a great shooter, so that 
really gets us going offensively,” 
said sophomore forward Kam 
Chatman. “Him starting really 
opens up the floor for Caris or 
(sophomore guard Muhammad-
Ali Abdur-Rahkman) or Derrick 
to get into the paint.”

Chatman made some noise 

himself. As soon as he came in 
off the bench, he dished the ball 
to Robinson, who took it home 
for a dunk. Within the next two 
minutes, he added five points, an 
assist, two rebounds and a block.

“Just coming in, I knew the 

play when I was going through 
it the past day, it was going to be 
open, so I told Duncan, ‘Just be 
ready,’ ” Chatman said. “And so 
just throwing that pass, it kind of 
got me going. It was pretty good.”

Junior guard Andrew Dakich 

also had a more impactful day 
than usual, burning his redshirt by 
checking into the game less than 
10 minutes into the first half. With 
Walton still recovering, Dakich 
supplements sophomore guard 
Abdur-Rahkman and LeVert.

“I mean, it was a no-brainer 

after he went down,” Dakich said. 
“Coach Beilein pulled me in and 
told me what was going on with 
Spike. I said, same thing as last 
year, (I’ll help) any way I can and 
contribute the best I can.”

The crowd favorite got Crisler 

Center to the loudest it was all 
game when he made his first field 
goal attempt by faking a 3 and 
completing a running layup. The 
walk-on had a career day in all 
categories with four points, three 
assists and two rebounds. 

“I didn’t want to shoot it today,” 

Dakich said. “I just wanted to get 
other people open. 

“It was nice. It was fun to see 

that first one go down.”

‘M’ routs Delaware State

The halftime entertainment 

at Crisler Center on Saturday 
afternoon 
featured 
“Tommy 

LaSwordfish” 
twerking 
in 

front 
of 

University 
booster 
Al 
Glick, 

“Kevin 
Duranteater” 
rolling 

around on the court to the 
sounds of Limp Bizkit and, 
of course, “Mackerel Jordan” 
swallowing a man whole and 
spitting him out wearing only 
his boxers. 

And 
though 
the 
antics 

of 
the 
giant 
sports-themed 

inflatable animals known as the 
“ZOOperstars” may have stolen 
the show during Michigan’s 
game against Delaware State, 
the 
Wolverines’ 
thorough 

demolition 
of 
the 
Hornets 

proved to be just as flashy — and 
at times, just as bizarre. 

It was a contest that featured 

Delaware 
State 
clanking 
17 

3-point attempts off the rim, 
Michigan chasing a slow-rolling 
loose ball three-quarters of 
the length of the court and 
sophomore guard Muhammad-
Ali Abdur-Rahkman appearing 
to square-dance in a 10-foot 
circle with a defender who 
hooked his arm while dribbling. 

But with the lowly Hornets 

(0-9) unable to 
get 
anything 

going 
offensively or 
defensively, 
the 
Wolverines 
had no issues 
finding shots 
all afternoon. 
Just five days 
after 
being 

manhandled 
in the low post by Southern 
Methodist, Michigan outscored 
Delaware State 36-10 in the paint 
(20-0 in the first half), made 11 
3-pointers, converted seven dunks 

and had six players reach double-
digit scoring in the 80-33 rout. 

“(I liked) the growth we made 

in those couple of days (after) a 
performance that we did not like 
at all,” said Michigan coach John 
Beilein. “We were really solid with 

our 
defense. 

Our offense, the 
ball didn’t stick 
nearly as much 
— we had 23 
assists. We hate 
to lose, but the 
only good is that 
it really makes 
us better in some 
other areas.” 

The 

Wolverines (7-3) 

led from wire to wire, starting 
the game off with a 3-pointer 
from redshirt sophomore Duncan 
Robinson 
— 
who 
made 
his 

first start of the season — and 

beginning a 24-8 opening run. 

As usual, senior guard Caris 

LeVert 
led 
the 
charge 
for 

Michigan, scoring a team-high 
15 points while working as the 
lead guard for the third straight 
game in the absence of injured 
junior guard Derrick Walton Jr.

Junior forward Zak Irvin, 

whose 
game 
has 
steadily 

improved over the last few 
games as he continues to recover 
from back surgery, had one of his 
best showings of the year. After 
tallying nine points and nine 
assists at SMU, Irvin posted 12 
points to go along with eight 
rebounds. He also showed off 
his dribble-drive talents, finding 
open lanes on two straight first-
half possessions and finishing 
with one-handed jams. 

Thanks to a putrid 24-percent 

shooting performance for the 
game, the Hornets were never 

able 
to 
recover. 
Completely 

locked out of the paint, they 
resorted 
to 
launching 
21 

3-pointers, just four of which 
dropped through the net. The 
Wolverines also controlled the 
rebounding battle, 41-29.

Even against vastly inferior 

competition, Michigan came in 
knowing it would have to work 
on its defense and rebounding, 
especially with the Big Ten 
season looming. 

“Those are the two main 

things,” LeVert said. “I think 
today we did a great job of that 
— we limited their offensive 
rebounds, and we played great 
defense at times. We have to keep 
our focus up, because we know 
the level of competitiveness 
will rise as soon as the Big Ten 
season starts.” 

The usual suspects did most of 

the damage for the Wolverines, 
but several role players turned in 
solid performances as well. 

Sophomore 
forward 
Kam 

Chatman was feeling it from 
the moment he checked into 
the game midway through the 
first half, picking up five points, 
two assists, two rebounds and a 
block in his first three minutes 
on the floor. 

And junior guard Andrew 

Dakich, 
who 
burned 
his 

redshirt for the second straight 
season 
after 
senior 
guard 

Spike Albrecht announced his 
retirement yesterday, set new 
career highs with four points, 
three assists and two rebounds 
in his first game of the season.

Though 
Beilein 
admits 

“outsiders” might look poorly 
upon Michigan’s weak non-
conference stretch, he explained 
that 
playing 
opponents 
like 

Delaware State is important to 
get those role players a chance to 
see where they stand, even if the 
game isn’t pretty.

“There are some games where 

we can just get guys out there and 
get them minutes when the lights 
are really on,” Beilein said. “That 
was huge today.”

UCLA too much for Michigan

By CHRIS CROWDER

Daily Sports Writer

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball team faced a tall 
order, 
both 
literally 
and 

figuratively, when it faced No. 
20 
UCLA 

on Sunday. 
The Bruins 
(5-2) 
lost 

both of their contests to top-
five teams by single digits, and 
are physically a noticeably tall 
team. That size was an issue for 
the Wolverines.

The Bruins started the game 

with a big lineup, throwing out 
6-foot-3 forward Kacy Swain 
to match up with 6-foot-5 
Michigan center Hallie Thome. 
UCLA subbed in Swain with 
6-foot-4 Monique Billings to 
play alongside 6-foot-3 Paulina 
Hersler. Nine of the 12 active 
players on the Bruins’ roster are 
at least six feet tall, compared to 
the Wolverines’ four.

“They’re long, and they can 

run the floor,” Thome said. 
“They basically can pass to 
anyone on the court, and they 
can score. You could tell that 
they weren’t nervous when they 
stepped on the floor.”

Michigan (7-2) fought back 

with its own height in Thome, 
who scored a team-high 24 points, 
but the Wolverines fell, 86-77.

Michigan struggled to adjust 

to UCLA’s length, as sophomore 
guard Katelynn Flaherty missed 
her first three shots, including a 
wide-open layup. The Wolverines 
also adjusted to the Bruins’ 
three-quarter-court press, an 
element of Michigan’s game that 
it continues to implement in its 
own defensive agenda.

On both sides of the ball, 

Thome led the way.

“When (Thome) was out of the 

game, they really took advantage 
of the rebounding and the size 
difference,” 
said 
Michigan 

coach Kim Barnes Arico. “That 
definitely hurt us. She needs to 
be in the game for us, because we 
don’t have anyone else with that 
physical presence.”

After the Wolverines held a 

two-point lead at the end of the 
first quarter, the second quarter 

was no different, as the matchup 
remained a back-and-forth affair. 
About six minutes into the frame, 
Thome converted an and-1 to 
give Michigan a three-point 
lead. In the following possession, 
Bruins guard Kari Korver hit a 
deep 3-pointer to tie the score 
once again. The next time Korver 
got the ball, she converted from 
behind the arc again for her third 
3-pointer of the day.

The Bruins’ other star guard, 

Jordin 
Canada, 
came 
into 

Sunday’s matchup averaging 19 
points per game, but was held 
to only one by the end of the 
first half. While Canada was 
crucial for the Bruins in other 
ways, racking up seven rebounds 
and five assists, she still looked 
frustrated at times. With the 
band cooing, “O Canada!” in the 
middle of her free throw routine, 
she missed the next free throw, 
unable to get her shooting on 
track before the halftime break. 
Despite Canada’s slow start, 
UCLA led, 34-30, heading into 
the third quarter.

The Wolverines came out of 

the gate firing, making their first 
three shots. But a block ended 
the 
streak, 
directly 
leading 

to another three from Korver 
in transition. Three minutes 
later, freshman guard Boogie 

Brozoski tossed a rainbow pass 
from half court to Thome, who 
was cutting toward the basket 
for the fundamental layup. The 
players on the Michigan bench 
collectively jumped from their 
seats, down by just three. After 
a UCLA basket and two straight 
turnovers, the Bruins had their 
largest lead of the contest with 
2:30 left in the third quarter at 10.

UCLA’s length continued to 

be an obstacle, as guards such 
as senior Madison Ristovski 
couldn’t dish the ball into 
the 
paint 
without 
getting 

the delivery tipped or stolen. 
As 
Ristovski 
and 
Brozoski 

struggled, the Bruins thrived off 
their mistakes, leading by nine 
going into the fourth quarter.

“Any mistake that we made, 

they made us pay for it,” Barnes 
Arico said. “I think that is 
experience. On our side, that’s 
a sign of our youth. … We looked 
young at times.”

With about seven minutes 

left in the final frame, Flaherty 
drove into the lane, but was 
blocked. The ball was deflected 
right into the hands of Ristovski, 
who 
immediately 
knocked 

down a 3. On the ensuing 
Wolverine possession, Thome 
knocked down another basket. 
Junior guard Siera Thompson 

had an opportunity to cut the 
lead to two, but missed the 
layup. Canada, who eventually 
found her rhythm, scored four 
straight, bringing the lead back 
up to eight.

“The 
little 
things, 
the 

turnovers at the end, were what 
separated us,” Thome said.

UCLA didn’t look back from 

there, as Billings dominated the 
paint on both sides of the ball, 
finishing with 20 points and 11 
rebounds. The Wolverines were 
outrebounded, 45-27.

“We didn’t rebound great like 

we usually do,” Flaherty said. 
“That hurt us, and we tried to 
box out, and that’s something 
going forward we need to work 
on … Going in (to the paint), we 
got a lot of our shots blocked.”

It was fitting that the contest 

ended on a UCLA block. The 
Wolverines 
lost 
to 
a 
more 

talented and, ultimately, a much 
larger team.

“We always talk about being 

better tomorrow than we were 
today,” Barnes Arico said. “I 
think we’re always trying to get 
better. … If each one of us can get 
a little bit better, we can be a lot 
more successful against quality 
opponents. That’s what we try 
to do every day and will do from 
here on out.”

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL
Youth shows in 
first home loss

By BRANDON CARNEY

Daily Sports Writer

Hallie Thome was on track to 

earn her first collegiate double-
double. Then she picked up her 
fourth foul.

It 
was 
a 
situation 
the 

freshman center had never been 
in. Play too aggressively, and 
she’d be on the bench the very 
next possession based on the 
way UCLA forward Monique 
Billings drew fouls seemingly 
every time she touched the ball. 
Play too conservatively, and 
the defensive pressure Thome 
had been putting on the Bruin 
frontcourt would disappear.

Thome ended up choosing the 

latter.

At that point, when UCLA’s 

guards drove the lane, Thome 
was the only thing standing in 
between them and the basket. 

Her 
inexperience 
showed, 

as 
Michigan 
couldn’t 
put 

together a comeback against the 
20th-ranked Bruins on Sunday, 
falling 86-77.

The Wolverines had been able 

to keep up with UCLA for the 
first half and the beginning of the 
second half. But Michigan began 
to show its immaturity around 
the time Thome picked up her 
fourth foul with three minutes 
remaining in the third quarter.

After 
struggling 
with 
the 

Bruins’ height early in the game, 
the 
Wolverines’ 
offense 
ran 

through Thome. She had 20 points 
and seven rebounds when she 
was removed, leaving Michigan 
searching for a new strategy.

Freshman 
guard 
Boogie 

Brozoski 
committed 
two 

turnovers on the night, both in 
the time between Thome was 
subbed out and when she came 
back in with 8:44 left in the 
fourth quarter. With Thome 
off the court, the Wolverines 
committed five turnovers and 
were outscored 13-7 without an 
offensive option to replace her.

As 
UCLA 
continued 
to 

go to the basket, Michigan 

struggled to come up with an 
answer to stop them. Brozoski 
and freshman guard Nicole 
Munger couldn’t lock down 
their 
defensive 
assignments, 

and sophomore forward Jillian 
Dunston had to foul the Bruins’ 
forwards to prevent them from 
scoring easy baskets.

“We talk about it as a team,” 

Munger said. “We try and go 
out every game with the same 
mentality, 
and 
every 
single 

moment of every game. Nothing 
really changed because we have 
the same focus.”

But in this situation, not 

changing the game plan may have 
hurt the Wolverines. Michigan’s 
lead scorer was on the bench, 
and the younger players seemed 
to lose confidence as the deficit 
grew larger.

Michigan coach Kim Barnes 

Arico knew the only way the 
Wolverines were going to get 
their 
confidence 
back 
was 

sending Thome back in. But 
the freshman was overcautious 
defensively, and didn’t know how 
to handle the situation knowing 
she couldn’t pick up the foul.

“She’s been in that situation 

before where she’s picked up 
fouls early and she’s had to sit 
out,” Barnes Arico said. “But it’s 
been a while. She’s going to need 
to learn how to play successfully 
with fouls, because we really 
need her on the floor.”

Inexperience caught up to the 

young Wolverine squad Sunday, 
and while it may have ruined 
their chance at an upset, making 
mistakes and competing for a 
majority of the game with a top-20 
team will benefit Michigan with 
Big Ten play quickly approaching.

“We cut it to four and had 

some opportunities, and we 
didn’t make the best decisions,” 
Barnes Arico said. “Any mistake 
we made, they made us pay for. I 
think that is experience. On our 
side that’s a sign of our youth, 
and I think we’re going to grow 
and we’re going to learn from 
that.“
