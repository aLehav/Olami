* ELECTION 2010
City business
* leaders hope
Snyder's plans
will boost A2

Republican's tax
revamp will attract
businesses to Ann
Arbor, officials say
By ELYANA TWIGGS
Daily StaffReporter
"Optimistic" is the word that
Kyle Mazurek, the vice president
of government affairs for the Ann
Arbor Chamber of Commerce,
uses to describe the feelings most
Ann Arbor business owners have
about governor-elect Rick Sny-
der taking office on Jan. 1.
"We are doing everything we
can to support him," Mazurek
said. "We want to see him suc-
ceed, and we want to see the state
succeed."
Business owners throughout
the city say they're excited for
Snyder to take office because
they anticipate his business
experience and potential tax pol-
icies could draw new businesses
to the area and boost Ann Arbor's
economy.
"The bottom line for every-
body is getting Michigan mov-
ing in the right direction,"

Mazurek said.
However, Mazurek said he
isn't sure if Snyder's promises on
the campaign trail will come to
fruition during his term.
"We are at a point in time
where he is coming off the elec-
tion cycle and campaign and
starting to fully flesh out some
of the ideas he talked about in
a broad sense during the cam-
paign," he said.
One of Snyder's ideas is to
eliminate the current corporate
business income tax and replace
it with a new six-percent flat
corporate income tax. The tax
would exclude some small busi-
nesses and reduce business taxes
by about $1.5 billion.
Mazurek said this proposed
policy is one of the reasons peo-
ple in the business community
voted for Snyder.
Though Snyder's ideas to stim-
ulate the economy are currently
conceptual, Mazurek said Snyder
has a plan to create a more effi-
cient government so that citizens
get "more bang for (their) tax-
payer dollar."
He added that Snyder's lack of
political experience helped him
win votes.

Turnout in fall elections
up slightly from last year

Election director
says he hoped for
more than 10.2
percent turnout
By RACHEL BRUSSTAR
Daily StaffReporter
After collaborative efforts
between the Michigan Student
Assembly, LSA Student Govern-
ment and University of Michigan

Engineering Council, voter turn-
out in student government elec-
tions last week was up from last
year - though student govern-
ment officials say they'd like to
see an even bigger increase next
election cycle.
Fall student government elec-
tions, which took place last week,
saw an increase in voter turn out,
rising from 8.9 percent to 10.2
percent.
While the different student
governments across campus
have previously campaigned for

their individual elections, MSA,
LSA-SG and UMEC decided to
combine budgets and campaign
efforts in an attempt to get more
students to the online polls.
In an interview yesterday,
Sagar Deshpande, MSA elections
director, spoke about the assem-
bly's reaction to the voter turnout
in this election in comparison to
other years.
"While the increase isn't as
largeas we hoped, we are glad to
see anincrease," Deshpande said.

For many students, owning a pet
is worth breaking landlord's rules

'U' economists: Downturn's worst over

Landlords, animal
experts say balance
between college,
furry friends difficult
By DAVID BUCCILLI
Daily StaffReporter
While some students engage
in illegal activities like under-
age drinking and drug use, others
break the rules in order to cuddle

up with a furry friend.
Students living in off-campus
housing say they've hid their pets
from landlords with no-pet poli-
cies. Though these students say the
benefits of owning a pet are great-
er than the punishment of being
caught, landlords, animal experts
and student pet owners say balanc-
ing a college lifestyle with raising a
pet can often be difficult.
"I just wish that more landlords
would be open to having dogs,"
said one LSA sophomore dog
owner who asked to remain annony-

mous because the owner is illegally
keeping a yellow lab named Trap-
per in an apartment.
The owner said hiding the dog is
"worth the risk" of repercussions.
According to a sample lease
posted on the website of Prime
Student Housing, tenants found
with unauthorized pets will be
considered "in default of the lease."
In addition, tenants found with
pets will be charged $50 the first
time the landlord spots the petand
any subsequent sightings. Tenants

At panel, economists
also talk future of
U.S. economy
By AUSTINWORDELL
For the Daily
The worst of the recession is
over, according to economists
from the University, think tanks
and government organizations
who spoke at a two-day confer-
ence held at Rackham late last

week.
Economists expressed a mod-
est yet hopeful outlook on the
economy at the University of
Michigan's 58th Annual Eco-
nomic Outlook Conference spon-
sored by the Research Seminar
in Quantitative Economics. The
conference took place all day
Thursday and Friday morning
and attracted dozens of attendees
from various industries and sec-
tors.
Economists Joan Crary, Daniil
Manaenkov and Stanley Sedo -

all assistant research scientists at
the RSQE - presented The U.S.
Economic Outlook for 2011-2012.
In their report, the economists
predicted that the U.S. economy
would add 900,000 jobs by the
end of 2010 and another 1.5 mil-
lion jobs in 2011 - along with 2.4
million jobs in 2012. Nearly all
forecasts at the conference pre-
dicted job growth in the next few
years, but experts said the gains
still wouldn't offset the 8 million
jobs lost between the end of 2007

fainted while giving a lecture
on climate and global changes
at the University of Southern
California last week, accord-
ing to a Nov. 16 article in the
Daily Trojan.
Nye regained consciousness
shortly after the incident. .
The article reported that
Nye made a joke out of it,
exclaiming, "Wow, that was
crazy. I feel like Lady Gaga or
something."
Despite this incident, Nye
proceeded to give the lecture,
which was warmly received by
USC students and faculty.

The video was a parody of

the clip, a prospective stu-

The article reported that
the students in the group
issued an apology and clari-

intended to mock the signifi-

event itself.

Pike unites with OSU's
chapter for charity run

In annual event,
brothers run with
football from Ann
Arbor to Columbus
By VERONICA MENALDI
Daily StaffReporter
While many students were get-
ting hyped about the last Michigan
football home game of the season
over the weekend, Pi Kappa Alpha
fraternity brothers were already
prepping for Saturday's matchup
against Ohio State.
Seventy-two Pi Kappa Alpha
fraternity brothers ran roughly 90
miles with a football from Thurs-
day evening to Friday afternoon
as part of the fraternity's annual
Rivalry Run. Pike holds the event
each year in which runners carry a
football from Ann Arbor to Colum-
bus - or vice-versa depending on
where the game is - on a 187-mile
relay divided between two groups
of runners.
Normally the event takes place
the week before the Saturday foot-
ball game, but because the game
takes place during Thanksgiv-
ing break this year, the event was
pushed back one week.
Business junior Mike Adelman,
co-director of this year's event,
said in past years the run was split
between Pike and Phi Gamma
Delta fraternity - also known as
FIJI. But this year, due to differ-
ing opinions of where the proceeds
should go, FIJI decided to take
part in another fundraising event.
As a result, the University's Pike
chapter joined with Ohio State's
chapter in order to continue the
annual run.
LSA junior Jared Jaffe, current
president of Pike, said having the
chance to work closely with Pike's
OSU chapter was a great experi-
ence and allowed members to not

only raise money for cancer in a
"unique way" but also to "grow as
a fraternity."
Jaffe said representatives from
Pike nationals loved the idea of two
of their chapters joining together
for one cause. Jaffe said the event
was even more powerful because
the collaboration was between two
groups that are rivals.
"A lot of friendships were fos-
tered," he said.
The proceeds raised by this
year's run will go to the Univer-
sity of Michigan Comprehensive
Cancer Center and the Coach Carr
Cancer Fund, Adelman said and
new Pike members were required
to raise $10,000 collectively.
Though the run ended last week,
the brothers are still raising money
for the cause. A recently created
website - which will run through
the end of the semester - allows
the members to track donations
and for friends and family to make
online donations. As of 6 p.m. last
night the brothers raised $17,759
towards their $40,000 goal.
In the last three years, the Pike
Rivalry Run raised more than
$150,000 for the American Cancer
Society and UM Coach Carr Can-
cer Fund.
"The fight to support cancer
never stops," Adelman said. "We're
not going to stop when the run is
over. We want to raise as much as
possible and keep the door open as
long as we can."
Throughout the event, partici-
pating brothers could run as many
miles as they felt comfortable.
Most averaged two to three miles
before they switched with a broth-
er and rode in vans following the
runners, Adelman said.
However, he added some broth-
ers ran more than 10 miles each as
a challenge to both themselves and
others.
Jaffe said the brothers col-
lectively "run every single foot

between (Michigan) Stadium and
Ohio State's stadium."
The most rewarding part of the
experience was hearing the feed-
back from the Michigan Compre-
hensive Cancer Center, Adelman
said.
According to Adelman, the
money is being used for patient
care, patient family care and
research. Before the event, Adel-
man went every week to turn in
the money raised that week. He
said all the positive feedback was
"amazing", particularly since one
fraternity organized the fundrais-
er and the money went toward a
local cause.
"This year was really special
because we're supporting a truly
local effort," he said.
Jaffe said that while their mem-
bers were running, some thought
about the cause but others were
more focused on the moment.
"For me, personally, I was hav-
ing a blast with it," he said. "We'd
pretend to do football plays and
have a fun experience. For some
people it's also more sentimental."
LSA sophomore Gene Taras, co-
director of the run, said he was fas-
cinated by the idea of the run when
he first joined the fraternity fresh-
man year and was inspired to take
on a larger role in the event.
"I've been a Michigan football
fan my whole life," Taras said.
"I thought it'd be cool to run the
actual game day football and give
back to the community at the same
time."
Taras ran a total of 11 miles and
said he was motivated by his per-
sonal family connections to cancer.
"I have a bunch of family mem-
bers that died or had cancer," he
said. "(The event) meant a lot to
me. Every extra mile I ran was for
them."
Adelman said Pike plans to con-
tinue to hold the annual event and
hopes to raise more money each
year.

U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) on campus in April Stabenow was named chair of the Agriculture committee Friday.
Stabenow named chair of
Senate Agriculture Cmte.

New position means
Michigan Democrat
will oversee drafting
of five-year farm bill
DETROIT (AP) - Sen. Debbie
Stabenow will become the new
chair of the U.S. Senate Com-
mittee on Agriculture, Nutrition
and Forestry starting next year,
it was announced Friday, mean-
ing the Michigan Democrat will
oversee drafting of the next five-
year farm bill.
The two-term senator from
Lansing has served on the Agri-
culture Committee since 2001
and also was a member of simi-
lar committees in the U.S. House
and the state legislature.
She told The Associated Press
her appointment is "really impor-
tant for Michigan," where agri-
culture employs a quarter of the
work force. But although Michi-
gan is among the nation's leaders
in the production of milk, corn,
beet sugar, black beans, red tart
cherries, apples - and blueber-
ries, it has been less involved in
growing commodities, which
historically have been the focus
of federal farm bills.

But Jim Byrum, president
of the Michigan Agri-Business
Association, predicted the
upcoming farm bill - which is
expected by 2012 - is going to
"have a lot less farm and whole
lot of other things," such as nutri-
tion, specialty crops and conser-
vation, and Byrum said Stabenow
is a leader in such areas.
"She has a great understand-
ing of these kinds of things, so
it's going to be a real winner," he
said.
The ag chair job is the second
leadership post the 60-year-
old lawmaker has picked up in
recent days. Stabenow also is
the new vice chairwoman of the
Democratic message and rapid
response operation, serving
under Sen. Charles Schumer of
New York.
The higher-profile jobs come
at a good time for Stabenow, who
is up for re-election in 2012 and
will be running in a state that
gave big victories to Republicans
earlier this month.
"I am planning on running for
re-election," she said. "I think
that, right now, given the incred-
ibly challenging times we have on
the economy, that I'm in a critical
spot to focus the federal govern-
ment on jobs."

Stabenow said she's not con-
cerned about running two years
removed from an election cycle
dominated by the GOP.
"No. We in Michigan are a
very independent lot, and I'm
very independent as well,"
she said. "I think it's critically
important that we get things
done, and I always work across
the aisle to do that. I'll work
with anybody who wants to cre-
ate jobs and make things better
for Michigan families and Mich-
igan businesses."
Stabenow will replace current
Agriculture Committee Chair-
woman Blanche Lincoln. The
Arkansas Democrat was defeated
in the Nov. 2 general election.
Stabenow is the fifth-ranking
Democrat on the committee, but
the senators who outrank her
are all chairmen of other com-
mittees. North Dakota Sen. Kent
Conrad had said he was consid-
ering the Agriculture post but
announced Friday he will keep
his position of chairman of the
Senate Budget Committee.
Stabenow is the first Michigan
senator to even sit on the agricul-
ture committee since Philip Hart
in the 1960s and is the first chair
since Thomas Palmer in the late
1880s, her office said.

NEWS BRIEFS
DETROIT
Lawyer: Stripper
danced at former
mayor's house
A lawyer says a stripper got
$1,000 to perform at a dope-fueled
party at the Detroit mayor's man-
sion and saw Kwame Kilpatrick's
wife attack a woman who was giv-
ing the then-mayor a lap dance.
Tamika Ruffin's statement
comes in documents released Sun-
day by Norman Yatooma, lawyer
for another stripper killed months
after the long-rumored 2002
party.
Yatooma's filing is a response to
efforts by Kilpatrick and the city
to dismiss a lawsuit by Tamara
Greene's family. The 27-year-old
Greene was shot to death in 2003.
Her family says city officials sup-
pressed the investigation.
No one has been charged,
and city lawyers deny officials
squelched a probe.
Ruffin claims Carlita Kilpatrick
attacked Greene with a table leg or
board.
City and Kilpatrick lawyers did
not return messages to The Asso-
ciated Press.
TRENTON, N.J.
Detroit and Flint
among top five most
dangerous cities
A national study finds St. Louis
overtook Camden, N.J., as the
nation's most dangerous city in
2009.
The study released yesterday
by CQ Press found St. Louis had
2,070.1 violent crimes per 100,000
residents, compared with a nation-
al average of 429.4. That helped
St. Louis beat out Camden, which
topped last year's list and was the
most dangerous city for 2003 and
2004.
Detroit, Flint, Mich., and Oak-
land, Calif., rounded out the top
five.
For the second straight year, the
safest city with more than 75,000
residents was Colonie, N.Y.
The annual rankings are based
on population figures and crime
data compiled by the FBI. Some
criminologists question the find-
ings, saying the methodology is
unfair.
TALLAHASSEE, Fla.
Police: Fla. mother
and three children
murdered in home
The deaths of a young moth-

whose bodies were found in their
home are homicides, police said
yesterday.
Autopsies were completed yes-
terday and authorities are looking
for information on anyone who
may have wanted to harm the fam-
ily, said Tallahassee police spokes-
man David McCranie. Police
refused to release the autopsy
results or how the victims died
because making those details pub-

lic might hurt the investigation,
Tallahassee Police Chief Dennis

Police said the victims are
27-year-old Brandi Peters, her
6-year-old twin daughters, Tami-
yah and Taniyah Peters, and
3-year-old son, Jovante Segura.

the street, said her kids often
played with the slain children.
ST. PETERSBURG, Russia
Tigers may become
extinct in 12 years,
experts say
Wild tigers could become extinct
in 12 years if countries where they
still roam fail to take quick action
to protect their habitats and step up
the fight against poaching, global
wildlife experts told a "tiger sum-
mit" yesterday.
The World Wildlife Fund and
other experts say only about 3,200
tigers remain in the wild, a dra-
matic plunge from an estimated
100,000 a century ago.
James Leape, director general
of the World Wildlife Fund, told
the meeting in St. Petersburg that
if the proper protective measures
aren't taken, tigers may disappear
by 2022, the next Chinese calendar
year of the tiger.
Their habitat is being destroyed
by forest cutting and construction,
and they are a valuable trophy for
poachers who want their skins and
body parts prized in Chinese tradi-
tional medicine.

University alum Michael Sherraden, one of Time magazine's 100 most influential people, speaks on Friday.
A SOCIAL AFFAIR?
U' School of Social Work celebrates its
90th year with 'U' alum and pioneer in
the field Michael Sherraden

By DAVID BUCILLI
Daily StaffReporter
One of this year's 100 most
influential people according to
Time magazine came to the Uni-
versity on Friday to celebrate the
90th anniversary of the School of
Social Work.
University alum Michael Sher-
raden, founder and current direc-
tor of Washington University
in St. Louis's Center for Social
Development, told the audience
at the School of Social Work
building about his innovative
ideas on poverty issues and social
work. Sherraden is known for his
ground-breaking theories, which
advocate assisting low-income
families in establishing savings
accounts so that they can build
assets.
Laura Lein, dean of the School
of Social Work, started the event
by congratulating Sherraden on
his many achievements, which
include serving as an advisor to
both Republican and Democratic
White House administrations
and to many federal departments.
"His theory and research ... has
influenced policies and programs
in the United Kingdom, Korea,
Canada, China, Australia, Peru,
Uganda and other countries,"
Lein said.
She highlighted how impor-
tant it is for the University to

be represented by someone like
Sherraden, who holds a master's
degree and doctorate in social
work from the University.
Speaking at the event, Sher-
raden began his address by prais-
ing the School of Social Work.
"It's really a great honor to be
able to give this talk at my alma
mater," Sherraden said, pointing
out the continued success of both
the master's and doctorate pro-
grams in social work at the Uni-
versity, even going as far as to say
the doctorate program was "by
far" the best in the country.
Sherraden said he was very
interested in young people and
"where they fit in society and
where they didn't fit in society,"
when he was studying at the Uni-
versity.
He continued by saying how
underrated social workers and
their responsibilities are in this
country, adding that much of the
world's major issues and advance-
ments are social.
"A lot of what has made civili-
zation possible and made it pos-
sible for people to work together
and generate economic produc-
tivity are social creations," he
said. "Organizations have to be
built. People have to work togeth-
er. There has to be a governed
structure where people can coop-
erate and make decisions without
killing each other."

Sherraden added that at least
50 percent of the budgets in many
countries are social expenditures.
"A lot of what makes the world
function successfully is social,
and it is not automatic," he said.
"It requires work. And we should
embrace these terms much more
than we do."
Sherraden later shared his
thoughts with the audience about
the future of the field of social
work and service work.
"It could easily become nor-
mal for people to think about a
life that includes a year or two of
serving in some kind of way that's
not military service," he said, giv-
ing examples like helping to build
schools, teach languages or other
community-development projects.
Sherraden added that with
Americans having "extended" life
spans, more volunteer and work
opportunities could become nec-
essary.
"There are very few structured
roles for older adults," he said.
After the event, Social Work
Prof. Trina Shanks praised Sher-
radon, thanking him for his "won-
derful talk" and for the many
years of mentorship he provided
her and other former students.
"Your ideas have inspired me
and many others over the last
decades and have just become
bigger and more national and
more immediate," Shanks said.

Environmentalists
and manufacturers
divided on chemical
regulation plan
LOS ANGELES (AP) - It's
almost unthinkable now that
environmentalists and manufac-
turers once stood together as Gov.
Arnold Schwarzenegger signed
a bill making California the first
state to regulate toxic chemicals
in consumer products.
Two years later, with regula-
tions set to take effect in January,
the longtime foes are increasingly
at odds over how the state should
implement regulations that would
apply to everything from baby
bottles to cars.
Environmentalists complain
the plan is too slow to be effec-
tive, while manufacturers say the
state rushed to draft regulations
so bureaucratic and broad they
would even apply to the sale of a
used boat.
The Department of Toxic Sub-
stances Control has revised the
rules to address criticism as com-
panies threaten to sue if forced
to share the chemical makeup of
their products.
"I still love the law, it's just
this particular execution that's a
disaster," said Maureen Gorsen,
who proposed the initiative when
she headed the DTSC - but is now
advising the auto industry against
it. "There's no incentive for the
good and no incentive for the bad
- there's just paperwork."
Proponents hope the law won't
become mired in legal wrangling
because the stakes are high: other
states, the federal government
and even other countries are
watching as the new law moves
toward reality.
"It's really important for this
to get off on the right track," said
Assemblyman Mike Feuer, D-Los
Angeles, who authored the bill,
saying it "could be a whole new
model for how we break the link
between toxic chemicals and can-
cer and other serious diseases."
There are tens of thousands
of chemicals in the stream of
commerce - chemicals found
in everyday products from com-
mercial paint to tires. Eighty-five
percent of chemicals that come on
the market "have zero info about
health and safety," said Joseph H.
Guth, a scientist at the Berkeley
Center for Green Chemistry,
"We're really talking about a
giant task that has only gotten
bigger - the backlog of evaluating
all the chemicals in commerce is
enormous," he said.
The idea was to use science to
identify harmful chemicals, look
at products in which they might
be found and require manufactur-

era to develop safer alternatives.
The state could eventually ban
certain unsafe products from
being sold in California. Regula-
tors could also enforce fines of
$25,000 a day per violation or jail
time against officials of compa-
nies or other people selling prod-
ucts with banned chemicals.
Environmental groups said
they supported the law because
they wanted to prevent situations
where manufacturers replaced
one toxic ingredient with another,
such as replacing asbestos in car
brake-pads with copper, which is
toxic for waterways, or using toxic
cadmium instead of lead in chil-
dren's jewelry - a development
reported by The Associated Press
in January.
"We have a system now where
chemicals are innocentuntil prov-
en guilty which is an appropriate
standard for criminal justice but
not for chemical safety," said Bill
McGavern with the Sierra Club.
For their part, companies said
they supported the measure
because changes to their products
would be scientifically based and
no longer a knee-jerk response to
the latest product scandal. They
also hoped the law would create
a wave of safe product innovation
and interest among consumers
similar to advancements in green
building.
The bill passed the Assembly
with a two-thirds majority vote
but since the drafting process
began, disagreements have been
on the rise.
"Our regulatory proposals are
intended to prevent California
from becoming a toxic dumping
ground," said Maziar Movassa-
ghi, acting director for the regula-
tory agency. "Our goal is to make
sure there is compliance but some
companies are going to invest in
research and development and
some companies are going to
invest in lawyers."
The Green Chemistry Coali-
tion, which represents corpora-
tions ranging from major drug
companies to Boeing Co., believes
the regulations go too far. The law
was supposed to apply to consum-
er products but the current defini-
tion is so inclusive that everything
bought, sold or leased in the state
is considered a consumer product,
said John Ulrich, executive direc-
tor for the Chemical Industry
Council of California.
Another problem, he said, is
that the proposed list of what
chemical traits might be consid-
ered hazardous includes every-
thing from carcinogens to skin
irritants.
"This means that every chemi-
cal in the state of California
becomes a potentially regulated
chemical and every industry
becomes a potentially regulated
industry," said Ulrich.

North Korl~ea buld
new nuclear facility
Secret uranium rt
facility sparks fear
of nuclear weapons
development

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -
North Korea has secretly and
quickly built a new, highly sophis-
ticated facility to enrich uranium,
according to an American nuclear
scientist, raising fears that the
North is ramping up its atomic
program despite international
pressure.
The scientist, Siegfried Hecker,
said in a report posted Saturday
that he was taken during a recent
trip to the North's main Yongbyon
atomic complex to a facility with
a small industrial-scale uranium
enrichment facility. The facility
had 2,000 recently completed cen-
trifuges, he said, and the North told
himit was producinglow-enriched
uranium meant for a new reactor.
Hecker, a former director of the
U.S. Los Alamos Nuclear Labora-
tory who is regularly given rare
glimpses of the North's secretive
nuclear program, acknowledged
that it was not clear what North
Korea stood to gain by showing
him the formerly secret area.
The revelation could be
designed to strengthen the North
Korean government as it looks to
transfer power from leader Kim
Jong Il to a young, unproven son.
As the North's economy suffers
and Washington and others tight-
en sanctions, unveiling the centri-
fuges could also be an attempt by
Pyongyang to force a resumption
of stalled international nuclear
disarmament-for-aid talks.

U.S. nuclear envoy Stephen Bosworth, right, shakes hands with his Sooth KoeNan
counterpart Wi Sung-lac before their meeting in Seoul today.

Whatever the reason, the new
centrifuges provide a fresh set of
worries for the Obama adminis-
tration, which has shunned nego-
tiations with the North following
Pyongyang's nuclear and missile
tests last year and in the wake of an
international finding that a North
Korean torpedo sank a South
Korean warship in March, killing
46 sailors. The U.S. State Depart-
ment announced that the Obama
administration's special envoy on
North Korea planned to visit South
Korea, Japan and China, starting
yesterday.
Hecker wrote that his first
glimpse of the new centrifuges was
"stunning."
"Instead of seeing a few small
cascades of centrifuges, which I
believed to exist it North Korea,
we saw a modern, clean centri-
fuge plant of more than a thou-
sand centrifuges, all neatly aligned
and plumbed below us," Hecker,
a Stanford University professor,

wrote.
Hecker described the control
room as "astonishingly modern,"
writing that, unlike other North
Korean facilities, it "would fit into
any modern American processing
facility."
The facilities appeared to be pri-
marily for civilian nuclear power,
not for North Korea's nuclear arse-
nal, Hecker said. He said he saw no
evidence of continued plutonium
production at Yongbyon. But, he
said, the uranium enrichment
facilities "could be readily con-
verted to produce highly enriched
uranium bomb fuel."
Uranium enrichment would
give the North a second way to
make atomic bombs, in addition
to its known plutonium-based
program. At low levels, uranium
can be used in power reactors, but
at higher levels it can be used in
nuclear bombs. Hecker's findings
were first reported in The New
York Times.

We are finally beginning to see some
of these tough decisions that we made in
the midst of the crisis pay off.

10 percent relevant
MSA needs to encourage student voter turnout
The Michigan Student Assembly held midterm elections
last week - but apparently only 10 percent of students
cared, even though this will be the last year that mid-
terms are held. On Nov. 16, MSA adopted significant changes to
its structure, including the elimination of midterm elections.
Scrapping the November elections was a good move, but the
change can't overshadow the low voter turnout in MSA elections
- which has been abysmal for years. MSA needs to become more
relevant to the student body to encourage participation. At the
same time, in order for the students to hold MSA representatives
accountable, they need to vote in every election.

When Detroit fell from the
ranks of America's top cit-
ies (early 1960s, I'd say),
there were many
things it lost: peo-
ple, businesses,
jobs, splendor and
itsgood reputation.
One thing the city.
kept at the same
rate as any other
large urban center,
however, was gov-
ernmental hubris IMRAN
and delusional,
empty pride. SYED
From the elec-
tion of Mayor Cole-
man Young through the failures of
Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick, Detroit's
vanity was its most plentiful resource
and greatest poison. It was vanity
that allowed the city's voters to look
past Young's many improprieties at
a time when more effective manage-
ment may have prevented the city's
collapse. And it's that same van-
ity that allows city council today (I'll
leave Mayor Dave Bing out of this for
now) to continue to reject solutions
to save the city for the simple reason
that they are funded by "outsiders,"
managed by "outsiders" or simply are
what the "outsiders" want.
As unfortunate and destructive as
this arrogance is, I suppose we might
understand why Detroit's elected
officials play up this stance. They are
politicians and pretending to fight off
meddling by outsiders is a good sell to
voters. But when Detroit's press falls
into this narrow-minded trap, then
things can get much worse still.
In a recent editorial, the Detroit
Free Press derided a ruling by St.
Clair County Judge Peter Deegan
decreeing that Wayne County
courts are grossly under-funded
and must receive a large influx of
funds immediately (A blank check for

Wayne County courts is out of order,
11/11/2010). (Detroit is in Wayne
County. While the two technically
have separate governing structures,
Detroit accounts for the vast majority
of the activity in the county's circuit
courts. Deegan, a disinterested out-
side judge, was asked to decide the
case for the sake of fairness.)
The Free Press wrote that Wayne
County has far bigger problems to
deal with. Money is tight and the
county certainly doesn't need an out-
side judge telling it what to do. Parts
of that opinion are defensible, though
ultimately wrong. The last part, how-
ever, is just an example of Detroit's
press showing the same stubborn
defensiveness that has characterized
and hindered the city's government
for the better part of five decades.
Yes, Wayne County, like all large
urban counties is constantly short
on cash. The problem is exacerbat-
ed here because of a shrinking tax
base and aging infrastructure. And
yes, there are many other problems
for the city and county to deal with.
But Deegan reached his decision not
because of some crazy ideal of lavish,
luxurious government spending, but
rather because he found that unless
the courts receive more funding, the
county's residents will be denied
access to justice. There may be other
places to spend money but funding
courts should be a top priority.
My own experience with Wayne
County courts and the judicial pro-
cess in Detroit leads me to believe that
Deegan's conclusion is absolutely cor-
rect. In the University Law School's
Innocence Clinic, we file all sorts of
motions and requests with courts in
various Michigan counties. In no other
county is the process as difficult, slow
and broken as in Wayne County.
Deegan specifically noted that the
Wayne County Clerk's Office must
receive more funds so that it can hire

enough staff to bring filings up to date.
Having waited on hold over the phone
for literally hours and devoted the bet-
ter part of the day to filing motions in
Wayne County (a process that takes
mere minutes in any other county and
can often be done online), I know that
the things Deegan deemed necessary
are true necessities for access to justice
in Wayne County.
Detroit needs to
accept help from
outsiders:
Knowing that the Free Press's edi-
torial stance is all about equality and
justice, I believe it would also agree
with Deegan's solutions if it took a
moment to reflect on the grave truth
of the problems he means to address.
Instead of engaging with honesty and
listening with an open mind, the Free
Press retreated into a familiar safe
zone and took the easy shots at med-
dling "outsiders" that we've seen a
thousand times before from Detroit's
elected leaders.
The result is that now, not only can
Wayne County officials sit by and do
nothing to solve the problems caused
by a grossly under-funded court sys-
tem, but the press will also actually
applaud this decision. Neither of the
two groups that are supposed to look
out for the people - government and
the press - are doing their jobs. They
sit ensconced in their familiar corner,
baring their fangs at any "outsider"
who dares to offer help.
Meanwhile,Detroit's failure continues.

Last week, several student governments
held midterm elections, including MSA, the
University of Michigan Engineering Coun-
cil, Rackham Student Government and the
LSA Student Government. Final figures on
MSA election turnout were delayed because
of technical difficulties that prevented stu-
dents in the College of Nursing from voting.
Results released to the Daily showed that
voter turnout this semester was 10.2 percent.
Last year, the midterm elections garnered a
9-percent turnout. In March, when the MSA
president and vice president were elected, 14
percent of students voted - the highest per-
centage any MSA election had seen in years.
This year is the last year that November
elections will be held. The Daily reported
on Wednesday, that MSA voted to imple-
ment a new compiled code to improve voter
turnout and restructure its legislative and
executive branches. Among the new rules
was a provision to eliminate November
midtetrelections. Changes are slated to
take effect in March.
Getting rid of the midterm elections is a
smart decisioas, Because fewer and less vis-
ible seats are filled, students know even less
about candidates than they do in the spring
elections. In essence, the dismally low
turnout and lack of awareness about the
midterm elections renders them useless.
MSA has recognized this ineffectiveness
and changed the policy. Now, students will
only have one election to keep track of - the

general election. This may help increase
voter turnout by adding more weight to the
March general election.
For this midterm election, MSA worked
with UMEC, LSA-SG and other organiza-
tions to increase voter turnout. Student gov-
ernment publicized the election through
flyers, Facebook and e-mails. They hoped
that election results and voter turnout statis-
tics would show that advertising campaign
was effective. But there was only a 1-percent
increase from last year.
10-percent turnout - though it's better
than last year's midterms - is still terrible.
MSA has the potential to be an integral part
of the connection between students and the
University administration - and students
need to recognize this. voting is the only
way for students to hold MSA representa-
tives accountable for their actions. If stu-
dents don't vote, MSA won't be able to gain
legitimacy because it won't be responding
directly to students' wants and needs.
But MSA also needs to improve its rel-
evance. The organization must aggressively
campaign for reforms like open housing (for-
merly known as gender-neutral housing),
provide students with interesting activities
and increase the amount of money it distrib-
utes to student groups.
MSA needs to step up - but so do students.
When the winter elections roll around, let's
hope that more than a tenth of the student
population shows up at the polls.

Protect privacy in public

Amidst the smoldering wreckage of privacy
and the Fourth Amendment left behind by the
misuse of technology and a post-Sept. 11 men-
tality, it seems almost trite to advise people
that, "those who would sacrifice liberty for
security deserve neither," as Benjamin Frank-
lin once put it.
In a world where it can be assumed that
your text messages are being read by some spy
at the National Security Agency (if you haven't
already updated the whole world via Facebook
or Twitter), it may seem like the fight to main-
tain some semblance of privacy is over or at
least futile. Thankfully, there are some areas
of our private lives where there is still time
for proactive action. The Ann Arbor Freedom
From Surveillance Ordinance takes steps to
protect the privacy of individuals and allow the
police reasonable access to surveillance.
The use of surveillance cameras as a means
to curb crime is nothing new. Private institu-
tions and businesses as well as governments
and law enforcement have used these cam-
eras for years to observe their customers and
constituents. These invasions of privacy are
generally justified through ex post facto expla-
nations that these cameras, while intrusive,
are worthwhile because of their supposed abil-
ity to prevent and help solve crimes.
This claim is rarelygiven close scrutiny. When
you look at the sum of available empirical evi-
dence, it becomes clear that cameras are ineffec-
tive in combating crime. The United Kingdom
Home-Office Study - a meta-study published in
2005 to evaluate the effectiveness of the coun-
try's closed-circuit television (more commonly
referred to as CCTV) systems - found that the
installation of surveillance cameras didn't reduce
the overall level of crime, didn't make people feel
safer and didn't cause people to change their
behavior. So in many ways, surveillance camera
advocates are asking people to trade their liberty
for a false sense of security.
Across the world, most notably in Great Brit-
ain, the last few years have given rise to a tre-
mendous increase in government surveillance

through the utilization of CCTV cameras. This
can be observed in cities as close as Lansing,
where there are now surveillance cameras in
several residential neighborhoods.
Ann Arbor has, so far, not been a victim of
this trend. While there are certainly plenty of
private surveillance cameras throughout Ann
Arbor, there hasn't been an increase in govern-
ment or police cameras installed. This absence
gives us the opportunity to plan how we want
to protect privacy in our community - a type
of planning that has largely failed to occur
across the country. It's precisely this absence
of planning that leads to the proliferation of,
government surveillance.
The Ann Arbor Freedom From Surveil-
lance Ordinance proposes, amongst other
things, to ban surveillance cameras in resi-
dential neighborhoods while allowing the
installation of cameras in high-crime areas.
Also included are provisions that require the
police to maintain a web-accessible database
of every camera they've installed throughout
the city, while also requiring every installed
camera to be renewed yearly. The renewal
process is especially important because the
tendency is for these cameras to be installed
and never be removed. The renewal require-
ment ensures that cameras don't outlive their
usefulness. The proposed ordinance strikes a
middle ground between the current Wild West
approach and a more radical law, that would
perhaps ban surveillance cameras altogether.
This issue is important to us because mass
surveillance programs fundamentally alter the
communities they monitor. Even though cam-
eras can seem benign, the specter of constant
observation is difficult to ignore. By supporting
the Ann Arbor Freedom From Surveillance Ordi-
nance, we can make explicit our community's
rejection of the all-encompassing surveillance
society and establish a reasonable framework for
surveillance use by law enforcement.

Backpacking for Winter 2011
classes has begun and I, for
one, couldn't be more excited.
Going in for advis-
ing appointments, T
scheduling classes t
around practice
times, making *
sure I have enough
credits, choosing f
fun and interesting y
classes and going
on ratemyprofes-
sor.com constantly COURTNEY
are all a part of the FLETCHER
ritual of scheduling
classes that I look
forward to each
semester. But among those signing up
for classes is a small group that has yet
to leave the comfort of home.
Each year, a small group of student-
athletes make the decision to leave
high school a semester early and enroll
at the University for winter term. This
isn't specific to Michigan - young-
sters all over the nation in a wide array
of sports are starting to enroll ahead
of schedule. There's no single reason
for why student-athletes choose to do
this. Sometimes the pressure comes
from the coaches, sometimes the stu-
dent is ready to get out of high school
and sometimes it's for training pur-
poses. While it's ultimately a student-
athletes's decision to do what's best for
them, there are significant pros and
cons to be examined.
There are definite advantages that
come with an entire off-season of
training. Weight lifting, conditioning
and practice for college athletics are at
a whole different level of intensity than
high school. With four extra months
of training, players can learn the sys-
tem and be better prepared to step into
a role in the upcoming season if their
team calls for it. And when the season
comes around - unlike most fresh-
men - they will already be acclimated
to the demands and work necessary to
---the
podium

succeed as a student-athlete.
But early enrollment also comes
with several cons - most of which are
social. Ifa student-athlete leaves high
school early, they forfeit a lot of events
that are a big part of the high school
experience. Prom, senior trips, gradu-
ation and the fun of being a second-
semester senior are all gone.
Fitting in with the teamis also a con-
cern: identification isthehardestthing.
Are early-enrolled student-athletes
freshmen? Well, yes, technically. But
are they still a freshman when their
class comes in? Not really. This creates
a gap between the early-enrolled stu-
dent-athletes and their peers. A sense
of belonging becomes more difficult to
achieve. And on top of it all, coming in a
semester early doesn't guarantee more
playing time.
I actually considered early enroll-
ment after I committed to Michigan.
I was over the high school scene, was
going to devote a majority of my time
to volleyball anyway and was eager to
go to college. I could have done it, too.
I met with my high school counselor
several times and figured out a sched-
ule that would allow me to graduate
early and enroll in the University for
the Winter 2008 semester.
But looking back, I am so happy I
chose not to. When I was a senior in
high school, my team won a national
championship, I graduated in the
Georgia Dome, went to my senior
prom with all my best friends and
was able to have a somewhat normal
high school experience. The pres-
sures of recruiting had been pres-
ent since freshman year. For once, I
was secure and happy in where I was
going to college and able to sit back
and just enjoy being a teenager.
I think it's a mistake for people to
leave high school a semester early.
There are of course some situations
where the student-athlete is perfectly
happy and makes the right choice.
Three of my former teammates made

the decision to go to college early and
reaped the benefits as well as dealt
with the challenges. But their stories
aren't always the norm.
While many times football players
are the focus of early enrollment, it's
not just student-athletes who make
these choices. There are other academ-
ically-advanced students who aren't
challenged in high school and decide
to go early. Others make the choice
because of family or living situations.
These students face the same social
challenges that student-athletes face.
Instead of physical demands, these
students are challenged academically.
There's no reason
to rush through
high school.
My fear is that this practice will
start to happen more frequently.
Teams can benefit from student-
athletes undergoing an extra semes-
ter of training and universities can
get press for enrolling young, bright
minds early. Early enrollment could
become normal for students who
want to get ahead. A careful consider-
ation of how students will be affected
socially needs to be made before they
choose to do this more and more.
Student-athletes give so much of
themselves to their sports during
their four years of college competi-
tion. For most, there's no reason to
rush it. High school student-athletes
should enjoy what's left of a high
school experience and wait for the
pressures and commitment of college
athletics to start in the fall.

On hallowed ground

We are all
Potter's pals

'Part 1' pleases
Potterheads by
preserving the plot
By KAVI SHEKHAR PANDEY
Daily Film Editor

derous levels
of suspense,
but for a student newspaper film
critic, it also alluded to the prospect
of writing an acceptable assess-
ment of a "Harry Potter" movie.
After all, the current undergradu-
ate student body is considered the
"Harry Potter Generation" - those
who matured alongside Harry &
Friends - and will undoubtedly
read a review with intense scruti-
ny, making composing a successful
one a daunting prospect.
But with the force of a bludgeon
cracking the cranium, the realiza-
tion occurs that the filmmakers
were probably experiencing the
exact same fear - the fear of disap-
pointing the hordes of Potterheads
who have devoted so much of their
life reading, re-reading, watching
and re-watching the books and
movies; knowing that they deserve
to be satisfied, as their passion is
what made Potter a phenomenon.
So the decision to split the
final book, "Harry Potter and the
Deathly Hallows," into two films
was definitely a positive one for
fans who were tired of seeing their
favorite subplots and crucial char-
acter developments excised from
the film - most notably the pen-
sieve trips in "Half-Blood Prince"

"If you say vampires are better than werewolves one more time...

that examined the transformation
of Tom Riddle into Lord Volde-
mort. As the final entry in the
"Harry Potter" journey, the film-
makers understandably wanted to
send the fans off with the grand-
est experience they could possibly
muster. .
And "Deathly Hallows: Part
1," at least for the first half, is tre-
mendously grand. The film quickly
establishes the somber tone that
pervaded the book, leading to a
succession of intensely entertain-
ing, surprisingly violent action
sequences and an infiltration of the
Ministry of Magic that's equally
tense and comical.
Director David Yates, who has
helmed the series since "Order of
the Phoenix," began teasing his tal-
ent for staging spectacular wand
duels with the marvelous battle
at the climax of "Phoenix." A few
short battles popped up in "Half-
Blood Prince," but in "Deathly
Hallows: Part 1," Yates Hulks out,
unleashing his directorial exper-
tise and technical wizardry (ha!)
at full force with several fierce,
exciting set pieces within the first
act alone.
All is well until the infamous

"camping in the woods" segment,
an unrelenting barrage of teen
angst and plot stagnation that's
the entertainment equivalent of a
Crutacious curse. The sequence of
Harry, Ron and Hermione hiding
out in the woods was one of the
most mundane parts of the book, if
not the entire series, and is equally
dull in the film - which exposes
the issue of dividing the book into
two movies.
If "Deathly Hallows" were a
single movie, such lengthy, kind-
of-unnecessary sequences would
have been trimmed out. But by fol-
lowing the plot of the book very
closely and minimizing cuts from
the story, the film also inherits
the flaws of the book, such as the
aforementioned camping sequence
and narrative non sequitors that
feel uncomfortably out of place -
in particular, the events that tran-
spire at Godric's Hollow.
Aside from that, "Deathly Hal-
lows: Part 1" brings back all the lit-
tle things that have made the Harry
Potter movies so enjoyable. The
cast, made up of the cream-of-the-
crop of British actors, is as great
as ever and even brings Bill Nighy
("Love Actually") along for the ride

as the new Minister of Magic. The
film's really dark subject matter is
nicely matched bythe cinematogra-
phy - it's as if a Deluminator sucked
the light out of every scene - but
there's an appropriate amount of
humor delivered as always by Ron
(Rupert Grint) and the Weasley
twins. Lastly Dobby (Toby Jones),
once the Jar JarBinks of the "Harry
Potter" films, rips out the best role
in the movie as the heroic, hilarious
house elf who saves the day - like
a G6.
Perhaps the most understat-
ed quality of the films has been
the evolution of the chemistry
between Harry (Daniel Radcliffe),
Ron and Hermione (Emma Wat-
son). As the characters they played
grew up together, so did Radcliffe,
Grint and Watson - their interac-
tions in "Deathly Hallows: Part
1" are extremely organic, and it's
wondrous to see the love they have
for each other and their bond that
transcends friendship. It's these
quiet characterizations that have
helped us in the Harry Potter Gen-
eration mature ourselves. That's
why, for us, "Harry Potter" is not
just a book or a movie. Itris part of
who we are.

on Thursday SOHONI
night - ahem,
Friday morn-
ing.
Don't get me wrong: As films,
the quality has been up and down
- I'm a film person, and my rela-
tionship with "Harry Potter" over
the last decade has been love-hate
- but there's no mistaking the
lasting power of J.K. Rowling's
saga and how vital the film series's
careful execution has been to the
perpetual obsession that hits our
generation every year and a half.
We all grew up reading the
books; if you didn'tcgrow up read-
ing them, then you grew up with
people who grew up reading them.
First published in June 1997 in the
U.K. and about a year later in the
U.S., the "Harry Potter" series had
a good three to four years before
its inevitable cinematic adapta-
tion. After that, those who had
been content to live on in blissful
ignorance of the escalating profile
of The Boy Who Lived suddenly
didn't stand a chance.
Everybody - Harry, Ron,
Hermione, Dumbledore, Hagrid,
Malfoy, even Dobby - they all got
faces. Concrete, bankable faces
you could put on a poster.
Nine years ago, Warner Bros.
released "Harry Potter and the
Sorcerer's Stone" with a huge
production budget and even more
colossal box office gross. From
the very beginning it was clear, if
perhaps too clear, that the studio
and major players were dedicated
to faithfully adapting the novel to
the screen.
That dedication, even though
the quality of adaptation has been
muddled by complaints from both
book-obsessed fans and unfa-
miliar filmgoers, has never faded
from what is now the biggest film
series of all time.
No "Harry Potter" film has
reached - nor will the yet-to-be-
released "Deathly Hallows: Part
2" ever live up to - the fantasy
adaptation standard set by "Lord
of the Rings" earlier this decade.
But "Harry Potter" has faced an
entirely unique challenge and fit-
fully lived up to its reputation as
the most universal story of the
millennial generation.
When each "HP" film promises
to show viewers their favorite
scenes from the book while keep-
ing the humor and youth of the
text alive, fans flock to the theater:
somewhat-underwhelming sequel
after somewhat-underwhelming
sequel, the saga is not only toler-
ated, but celebrated by diehard
fans for at least mostly sticking to
the script.
I have never personally been a
huge fan of the films, and I'm not
especially obsessed with the story
as a whole. My interest in the
films has always been in the films
themselves and not the adapta-
tion therein - I cringe to hear the
minor complaints over changes
and gaps in the storyline. But
despite any frustration different

sets of viewers have found in the
films, there's no denying that the
entire franchise has been an utter

success beyond most realistic
viewers' hopes and expectations.
Part of that success is due to a
consistent creative evolution as
the films have progressed - from
the bright, young and immature
direction of the first two films
by Chris Columbus to the more
advanced, visually daring presen-
tation of the last three by David
Yates. The scripts, save for the
fifth installment, have been writ-
ten by screenwriter Steve Roves
with a consistent personality, and
have progressed from far-too-
juvenile to sufficiently PG-13. Like
the characters, the creative efforts
have become more mature with
each film to suit the series's aging
audience.
All the while, the most impor-
tant keys in all of this - the faces
onscreen - have remained and
grown with us. Daniel Radcliffe,
Rupert Grint and Emma Watson
are all household names in our
generation, and our connection
with them will last beyond the
"HP" films. They've not only aged
in front of our eyes, but matured in
talent and ability to appropriately
inhabit their roles. They have been
the most tangible sign of progres-
sion and the most solid connection
to its prime viewer base.
And that brings me to us.
College-aged viewers - the
ones old enough to remember
every moment of the last 12 years
of"Harry Potter" but young
enough to relate to the boy-wiz-
ard's plight - are the lifeblood of
Growing up
with The Boy
Who Lived.
the series, no matter how many
times older generationsachastise
us for obsessing over "a kids'
book."
Some (older) peoplereally just
don't get it. I'm not obsessed, but
I fully understand that "Harry
Potter" is our story - we grew up
with it, and we're seeing it reach a
fittingly epic end with its seventh
and eighth films.
That's why, if you were lucky
enough to catch "Deathly Hal-
lows" at midnight, you likely saw
a lot of 20-year-olds like me. The
books aren't children's books, just
as the films aren't children's films
- at least not anymore. What
started with children has followed
those children into adulthood and
itself grown along the way.
It's hard to know how we'll see
"Harry Potter" when the films are
complete. The range of fandom,
from casual viewer to Potterhead,
will always have variable opinions
of how well the screen fits the
story. We imagined Hogwarts
before Warner Bros. constructed
it, and saw Harry, Ron and Herm-
ione in our minds before Daniel,
Rupert and Emma came along.
While some people find that the
films conflict with their imagina-
tion, others revel in the contrast
and enjoy the connection the story
weaves through its fans.
Beyond any divisions, the saga
is ours. "Harry Potter" will always
be ingrained in our generation
- and even more important, our
generation will forever be a fun-
damental part of "Harry Potter."

It's getting old

One would think that at 36
years old, Nelly would have
evolved not just as an artist, but
as a person.
But he's still '*

money, chicks 5.0
and slick club
beats. His latest Universal Motown
hip-pop album
5.0 is a vapid mess of attempted
nightclub bangers and rehash-
ings of the rapper's older work.
While Nelly occasionally ven-
tures into the pop music realm on
5.0, his clever rhyming and South-
ern twang are noticeably absent
in an album populated with lazy
hooks and inane rhymes about
money. While Nelly's contempo-
raries have branched out from
simply imploring women (or
"shawtys") to shake their respec-
tive moneymakers, Nelly tragi-
cally never recovered from, as he
puts it, "get-money syndrome."

appearances by hip-hop main-
stays T-Pain and Akon (who
spends most of the track admir-
ing some girl's ass in typical
Akon fashion). This wannabe
club hit's one redeeming fac-
tor is Nelly's ability to spit his
game faster and with more
energy than almost any rapper
out there. However, it ends up
being a tiring, forgettable song
destined only to get play at the
clubs after everyone is too drunk
to notice the sheer dullness of
the track.
The worst part of the album is

Nelly's campy, soft rhyming. On
"Broke," Nelly claims that "My
crib is plush, plush / I'm talking
elevator / So don't you touch,
touch." Sophie Greene has a grat-
ing guest appearance, singing:
"If you ain't got no money then
you can't do nothing for me / In
Vegas, L.A., Miami and New York
/ Yeah I like shopping." Maybe if
Nelly met a nice, unmaterialistic
girl, he could write a hit about
something other than banging a
ho and gettin' dough (see Nelly,
rhyming isn't that hard). Despite
its exhaustive lyrics, "Broke" at
least has a solid hook and some
dance-party appeal due to tight
production and a hard-hitting
back beat.
On the radio-ready hit "Just a
Dream," Nelly drops the rapper
fagade and makes himself vulner-
able for the epic track. He switch-
es between rapping and singing
about a girl who left him heart-
broken. Nelly isn't afraid to cross
over to sugary, inoffensive pop
and the result is a decent track

From Page 5A
with a sing-a-long hook. Though
his fans will yearn for the rap-
per of yore, the soaring track has
chart-topping potential.
Of course, Nelly's status as
an emerging pop star requires a
little star power. Unfortunately,
the irrelevant Puff Daddy (or is
it P-Diddy these days?) steps up
and remains a fixture through-
out 5.0. On the aptly named "1000
Stacks," Diddy raps about expen-
sive champagne (or Lamborghinis
or something) and making money
while Notorious B.I.G. adds some
credibility from beyond the grave
to back up Nelly and Diddy's tag-
team. But it's doubtful Biggie
would want his sample attached
to such a boring track. Nelly
screams his verses at listeners
on this desperate attempt at club
fare, but nothing he's yelling is
all that innovative or worth the
stress of traumatizing your ear
drums.
The album closes with an awk-

ward piano ballad that has Nelly
attempting to pass off his whin-
ing as singing. "Nothing Without
Her" sounds like a parody, com-
plete with Nelly practically sob-
bing his lyrics like "When I look
deep in her eyes /I see there's love
inside." And though he spends
most of the album worshiping
money, Nelly disingenuously
claims, "See all the money in this
world don't mean / Nothing with-
out her," as a sentimental guitar
strains in the background. Now,
generally Auto-Tune shouldn't be
advocated, but Nelly's voice might
have benefited from some tweak-
ing on this track.
Nelly's latest is populated by
filler and marred by the rapper's
disappointing delivery of subpar
rhymes. Fans will pine for the
man of "Country Grammar" fame
who once rapped, "Forget the
fame and the glamour." Now all
Nelly raps about is fame and glam-
our. Though his last album Brass
Knuckles failed to sell as many
copies as his previous work, Nelly
has said he doesn't consider 5.0
to be a comeback. Which is good,
because it definitely isn't.

The Michigan Daily - michigandail
SNYDER
From Page 1A
"A lot of folks, especially in the
business community, thought it
was time to get someone from the
business community a shot at the
governor's office," Mazurek said.
Ann Arbor business owners
echoed Mazurek's sentiment.
Karl Couyoumjian, president of
TeL Systems in Ann Arbor, which
makes audio and video equipment,
said it's time someone in the busi-
ness realm leads the state.
"Rick understands what's
entailed in starting a business, run-
ning a business and the challenges
we are all faced with, especially in
the economic climate," said Couy-
oumjian, who is also the chair of
the Ann Arbor/Ypsilanti Regional
Chamber Board of Directors.
Couyoumjian said Michigan
would benefit if Snyder runs the
state in the same ways he's man-
aged his businesses. Before run-
ning for governor, Snyder was
chairman of the board for comput-
er giant Gateway and president of
venture capital firm Avalon Invest-
ments, Inc.
"He is approaching his gover-
norship as he has done with many
of his businesses," he said. "He had
a plan, assembled a great team, he
ran a great campaign and as gover-
nor (will do) the same thing."
Couyoumjian said Snyder's hon-
est and forward-thinking attitude
makes him the best choice for gov-
ernor. He added that he is excited
for the revitalization of the Michi-
gan business tax, which he says is
currently "broken."
According to Couyoumjian, Sny-
ECONOMY
From Page 1A
and the end of 2009.
In their presentation, Crary,
Manaenkov and Sedo explained
that the U.S. economy is not
rebounding with the same vigor
that characterized other post-
WWII recessions. The econo-
mists predicted that the country's
unemployment rate will average
9.6 percent in 2011, 9.3 in 2012 and
not dip below 9 percent until early
2013.
While what has been dubbed
the "Great Recession" is now over,
low consumer confidence levels,
fiscal problems at both the state
and the federal levels and lingering
troubles in the housing market are
stillhinderingrecovery efforts, the
experts said.
Crary and fellow researchers
expect the economic impact of
the stimulus package to plateau
and expect the actions of the U.S.
Federal Reserve System to eventu-
ally boost the economy. Crary and
colleagues predict that the Federal
Reserve will wait until the econ-

are also held responsible for any
costs associated with cleaning the
house due to the pet.
A sample lease posted on the
website of Arch Realty states that
tenants aren't allowed to have
pets unless they reach an agree-
ment in writing with the land-
lord. In addition, the first time
the landlord spots an unauthor-
ized pet the tenant is charged
$150 and $275 for any subsequent
sighting. If the tenant fails to get
rid of the pet and pay the fines in
a timely fashion, they'll be con-
sidered "in violation of the lease"
and the landlord could initiate
eviction procedures, according to
the lease.
"Sometimes I'm nervous the
landlord will come and check on
something, but our dog doesn't
really bark, so it's like he's not
there," Trapper's owner said.
"Whenever our landlord comes
over, the night before, we clean
the house, vacuum it, make it look
like (he) never existed ... Then
we drop (him) off at my friend's
house for a few hours."
The pet-owner said the land-
lord of the house she plans to live
in next year has an even stricter
no-pet policy. She said she plans
to continue hiding Trapper in her
new house, though she's consid-
ered other possibilities like giving
him to her brother who attends
Michigan State University.
Whatever happens, the owner
said she wouldn't abandon Trap-
per.
"I would never do that," she

Rick Snyder on campus earlier this month. Ann Arbor business leaders say they believe Snyder's plans will boost business in the city.

der's business policies could attract
more companies to the state, which
would yield more clients for busi-
nesses like TeL Systems and make
Michigan more competitive with
other Midwest states.
"Right now, one of the biggest
things working against Michigan
is that we have a really great state
with a lot of great resources, but we
just don't have a climate conducive
to attracting new businesses," he
said.
Snyder can make the state more
"business-friendly," Couyoumjian
said, adding that the state is not
retaining new businesses.

Rod Byrne, treasurer of the
Washtenaw Economic Club and
director of Wright Griffin Davis
and Company - an accounting
firm in Ann Arbor - said Snyder
has been a "positive force" for
attracting businesses to the Ann
Arbor area.
Byrne said Snyder is a "goal-ori-
ented and focused individual."
"He speaks our language and
understands the tax code a whole
lot better than anyone else." These
attributes, he said, could help the
Ann Arbor business climate.
Byrne, who is also the past
chair of the Ann Arbor Chamber

of Commerce, said the Washt-
enaw Economic Club - a group of
businesses that partner to bring
speakers to the Washtenaw com-
munity - could prosper with Sny-
der as governor because one of
Snyder's objectives is to develop
new business technologies.
"Right here in the Washtenaw
county area, between the Univer-
sity of Michigan, Eastern Michi-
gan (University) and Washtenaw
Community College, you've got
(students with) a high level educa-
tion dedicated towards those new
technologies and creating a new
economy for Michigan."


omy picks up in 2012 to reduce its
balance sheet and begin to increase
short-term interest rates in 2013.
Plans for decreasing the gov-
ernment's deficit and forming new
fiscal policy remain uncertain, but
the researchers at the conference
predicted that not extending the
tax cuts made by George W. Bush's
administration could damage the
economy.
Though the recession ended
more than a year ago, a common
sentiment among presenters at the
conference was that Americans
still feel like they're in a recession
because of the relatively weak job
market.
In summing up the prediction
for the U.S. economy for 2011 and
2012, Crary said Americans can
expect "short-term hesitation, fol-
lowed by muted growth."'
The outlook for the Michigan
economy mirrored that of the
nation, according to panelists at
the conference who said that the
recession only compounded the
loss of 850,000 jobs in the state
over the last decade.
George Fulton, director of the
RSQE, predicted that Michigan's

economy would see job growth
next year, which would be the first
time in more than a decade.
Fulton, along with Crary and
Donald Grimes, senior research
area specialist at the University's
Institute for Research on Labor,
Employment and the Economy,
estimated that the state would add
24,500 jobs in 2011 and 63,000
during 2012. However, these mod-
est gains would not offset the
247,000 jobs lost in 2009 and 2010.
They added that unemployment is
expected to decline but still remain
at a high level - averaging 12.4
percent in 2011 and 11.5 percent in
2012.
Fulton and his colleagues said
the service industry will have the
most job gains in the next few years
with business services, private
education and health care making
up expected additions. While other
Michigan industries have been in
decline, the increasing number of
elderly citizens has driven growth
in the health care industry.
One expected bright spot of the
Michigan economy is the stabiliza-
tion of the manufacturing sector
and, more specifically, the automo-

tive industry. Fulton stressed that a
prerequisite for economic growth
in Michigan is the health of the big
three Detroit automakers.
Despite recent stabilization of
the domestic auto market and the
effect that could have on the entire
Michigan economy, Fulton and his
colleagues were careful to not give
false hope, even though the worst
is over.
"Many residents will feel that
the recovery has yet to arrive," Ful-
ton said.
While other industries are
expected to grow, panelists at the
event said they expect the state
government to cut jobs during the
next two years.
Gary Olson, director of the Sen-
ate Fiscal Agency for the state of
Michigan, said it would be a chal-
lenge in the next few years to bal-
ance the budget at the state level.
As federal assistance ends, tough
fiscal decisions that were pushed
back will have to be made, he
explained.
"2011-2012 is the year of reck-
oning," Olsen said. "Government
can not be sustained without tax
increases."


said.
Bob Rubin, owner of Arbor
Properties, said his company
doesn't often allow tenants to
have pets.
"In general, people get pets
because they're cute," Rubin said.
While pets may be adorable
and fun to play with, Rubin said,
"they're a responsibility, and
(they have) an impact on other
people in the building as well as
the building itself."
Amy Khan, president of CMB
Property Management, said a
housing unit's location, layout
and yard size determines if pets
will be allowed. Ifa student wants
to have a pet, they have to sign a
pet addendum.
Khan added that the company
has not historically had problems
with students abandoning their
pets.
"In my 17 years of working
here, we had turtles abandoned
once," Khan said. "The students
left a note that said, 'We couldn't
take them. Please find them a
home.' In our pet-friendly build-
ings, we have not had neglectful
students when it comes to dogs or
cats."
Deb Kern, the marketing direc-
tor of the Humane Society of
Huron Valley, said the Humane
Society has pet-adoption restric-
tions for students. If students
want to adopt an animal, they
must be 21 years or older and a
Humane Society representative
will contact the landlord to con-
firm pets are allowed in their
building.
"Students tend to be in a tran-
sitional period and aren't in the
place to make these kind of life

decisions. We believe pets are a
lifelong commitment - part of
the family," Kern said.
Kern added that landlords will
find abandoned pets at their prop-
erties at the end of the semester
and the Humane Society is often
called to rescue the animals.
Rubin said students should
think about the future before
adopting a pet so that incidents
like this don't happen.
"If a person's going to rent
a house and knows what the
future's going to be like, that
makes sense (to own a pet)," he
said. "If a dog ends up in a pound,
that's a shame."
Kern said many University
students volunteer at the animal
shelter, which is a great alterna-
tive to owning a pet.
"A lot of times, they'll come and
volunteer for us," she said. "Dogs
need to be walked three times a
week, and there's cat cuddling
people can come in and do."
LSA junior Lauren Lewis said
she finds it difficult to balance
school with raising her 8-month-
old husky named Moose.
"Moose is a crier in the morn-
ing, so he gets up at 7. I don't have
class till 10," Lewis said.
Around 10 a.m., one of her
friends feeds him while Lewis
is in class. In the afternoon, she
takes Moose to one of Ann Arbor's
dog parks, where they often play
with dogs of other students.
"I think Moose is the cutest (at
the dog park), and he is," Lewis
said. "Everyone agrees."
Lewis said Moose sleeps for
about four hours every afternoon,
which allows her time to study.
At night, Lewis explained that

Moose gets "very rambunctious,"
and so she has to take him for a
walk.
"It's harder than I thought it
was, but I love it. I love Moose,"
she said.
LSA junior Kristin Boyer, who
owns a hamster named Reuben,
said owning a hamster is a great,
low-maintenance form of enter-
tainment.
"A lot of people will come over
to our house to play with him ...
We let him run out in his ball,"
Boyer said, adding that she's even
made a Facebook page for him.
Entertainment aside, Reuben
has created a bit of house drama.
"My roommates didn't like him
in the main area because they
thought he smelled," Boyer said.
An LSA senior, who requested
anonymity because the student's
landlords don't know about the
student's two cats Raja and Nala,
said caringfor cats is easybecause
they only need to be fed and have
their litter box cleaned. The most
important thing is making sure
they don't escape from the house,
the cat owner said.
"The worst thing that could
happen in Ann Arbor is having
cats on the loose. I thought they
got out once. It was terrible," the
cat owner said, adding that Raja
and Nala were eventually found
in a hamper.

WASHINGTON (AP) - Presi-
dent Barack Obama took aim
Saturday at Republican senators
standing in the way of a nuclear
arms reduction pact with Rus-
sia, saying they were abandoning
Ronald Reagan's lesson of nuclear
diplomacy: "Trust but verify."
The Senate's GOP leader
accused his Democratic counter-
parts of wasting Congress' lame-
duck session on issues from gays
in the military to environment
regulations. Sen. Mitch McCon-
nell, R-Ky., didn't mention Obama's
push to ratify the new START
weapons treaty with Russia, but
said extending expiring Bush-era
tax cuts needed to be the top pri-
ority.
Obama, speaking from a NATO
summit in Portugal, used his

part of a five-administration con-
tinuum, Obama said the treaty to
cut the permitted number of U.S.
and Russian long-range nuclear
warheads by a third was "funda-
mental to America's national secu-
rity."
The president went to great
length listing the prominent
Republicans from previous admin-
istrations who back the deal,
including former secretaries of
state Colin Powell, George Shultz,
Jim Baker and Henry Kissinger.
He cited GOP Sen. Dick Lugar's
support, but suggested that other
Republican senators were playing
politics with national security.
"Some make no argument
against the treaty - they just ask
for more time," Obama said. "If the
Senate doesn't act this year - after
six months,18 hearings, and nearly

be less cooperative in enforcing
strong sanctions on Iran, securing
loose nuclear material from ter-
rorists or helping the U.S. equip
troops in Afghanistan, Obama
said. He said no agreement with
Russia meant no U.S. inspectors
watching over one of the world's
biggest nuclear arsenals.
"Those who would block this
treaty are breaking President Rea-
gan's rule - they want to trust, but
not verify," Obama said.
At the NATO meeting, officials
from Denmark, Lithuania, Latvia,
Hungary, Norway and Bulgaria
told reporters Saturday that failing
to ratify the treaty would set back
European security.
McConnell, in the GOP radio
and Internet address, focused on
the stubbornly high unemploy-
ment rate and Democrats' failure to

year be extended.
"Americans don't think we
should be raising taxes on any-
body, especially in the middle of a
recession," McConnell said. "But
instead of giving Americans what
they want, Democratic leaders
plan to use the last few days that
lawmakers expect to spend in
Washington this year focusing on
everything except preventing this
tax hike, which will cost us even
more jobs: immigration; a repeal of
the 'don't ask, don't tell'; a reorga-
nization of the FDA; more environ-
mental regulations."
Obama appears ready to com-
promise with Republicans on tem-
porarily extending the tax cuts
passed under President George
W. Bush, despite previous opposi-
tion to continuing them for couples
making over $250,000.

for the coach - it sounds a lot like
an excuse. But at some point, an
excuse becomes too valid to dis-
regard.
"I'm not making excuses.
People will say, 'Ah, he's making
excuses,' but it's not - it's reality,"
Rodriguez said at the podium, get-
ting a little animated. "I've never
coached and had five true fresh-
men playing Division L Are you
kidding me? I mean, think about
that. Again, those guys are playing
their tails off, and they're going
to be better hopefully next year
because of it. But you guys are
pretty smart, go find a school that
has five or six true freshmen play-
ing significant time on defense."
It's an excuse and reality. As
much as I would like to say it, the
biggest problem with the defense
isn't the abjectly awful coaching of
defensive coordinator Greg Rob-
inson (Though it certainly doesn't
help - as gaudy as Wisconsin's
offensive numbers were, they
could havebeen a lot worse if the
Badgers would've taken advan-
tage of the WIDE-open middle of
the field through the air). It's the
youth in the secondary.
Some say, without thinking,
that this is Rodriguez's fault. He
should've recruited more (and
better) defensive backs. Here's
the thing: he had defensive backs.
They all just kinda ... left. That, or
they got injured.
JT Turner, Donovan Warren,
Vlad Emilien, Boubacar Cissoko,
Troy Woolfolk, JT Floyd - even
Demar Dorsey's failure to qualify
all contributed to the secondary's
woes this year.
There are still those who will
say - again, without thinking -
that it's Rodriguez's fault all those

Deshpande added that he
believed the collaborative efforts
of MSA with LSA-SG and UMEC
contributed to the increase in
voter turnout.
"A large number of factors go
into voter turnout, (MSA) being
just part of it," Deshpande said. "I
believe that this past election was
less contested than previous elec-
tions, however, I believe that our
work did do a great job of helping
push that turnout up, regardless."
In an e-mail interview on
Friday, LSA junior Zach Berlin,
elections director for LSA-SG,
commended the efforts of the
student governments to increase
voter turnout among the student
body.
"(LSA-SG), UMEC and MSA's
collaborative efforts were steps
in the right direction, and we are
looking to forward to exploring
other ways to get more people
engaged in government activi-
ties," Berlin wrote.
The exact voter turnout num-
bers for the student government
elections had previously been
delayed by a batch of exception
ballots.
"An exception ballot is sim-
ply any student who votes who

players left. But that's stupid. It's
each player's own individual deci-
sion. Look, a football coach is sup-
posed to be mean; he's supposed
to upset you; he's supposed to yell
and scream and get up in your face
so close you can feel the spit hit
your cheeks. If a player comes to
camp and can't handle not being
treated the same way he was when
he was being recruited, then he
should leave. And the family val-
ues thing? That still just makes me
laugh.
The fact is, much of what's
wrong with the defense is out of
Rodriguez's - or even Robinson's
- control. The Badgers moved
the ball at will against Michigan,
gaining 357 yards on the ground.
It was like watching grown men
play against boys. You know why?
Because that's exactly what it was.
It's impossible forthe defense
to get much better from now until
next weekend, when the Wolver-
ines play Ohio State. It sucks, but
that's just the way it is. All Michi-
gan fans can do is look forward
to having a defensive backfield
loaded with valuable, albeit pain-
ful, experience nextyear.
So yeah, I feel for Rodriguez.
He's stuck with an extraordinarily
young defense full of tough, hard-
working players who desperately
want to win but keep finding that
will is no match for experience
and strength.
Michigan running backs coach
Fred Jackson said it betterthan I
could: "They fought hard, and it's
a testament to them - shows the
character that these kids have. To
me, that's what this program has
always been about. Tough kids
with a lot of character. I think
they showed it to you today, they

isn't known to be affiliated with
a particular school," Deshpande
said. "So that simply means that
this year either there were stu-
dents who weren't already on the
list of students from the different
schools who said that they were
and we need to validate whether
those students are indeed in the
school they claim to be."
Deshpande explained that the
exception ballots are an issue
of students representing them-
selves, and not an issue that MSA
was able to control in the elec-
tion.
Additionally, complications *
with ITS in the election for the
School of Nursing also caused
delays in releasing the final voter
turnout numbers.
In an interview last week,
Deshpande told the Daily that
ITS had used an incorrect eli-
gibility list when setting up the
election for School of Nursing
students. ITS corrected the prob-
lem and contacted Nursing stu-
dents to explain the issue. MSA
also extended the Nursing elec-
tion by 24 hours to allow students
who may have previously experi-
enced complications to vote.
The error also caused a larg-
er number of exception bal-
lots, which underwent the same
review process as in the rest of
the student government election.

Stonum makes big
second-half catches

By RYAN KARTJE
Daily Sports Editor
As senior offensive lineman Ste-
phen Schilling headed to the locker
room at halftime of the Wolverines'
matchup with Wisconsin on Satur-
day, it all seemed familiar.
Little offensive production. Zero
points. No rhythm. A huge, seem-
ingly insurmountable deficit. It all
felt like Michigan's 2008 matchup
with the Badgers - one in which
the Steve Threet-led Wolverines
overcame a three-score halftime
deficit to give Michigan coach Rich
Rodriguez his first signature in the

maize and blue.
"We had come back from just
about this much before," Schilling
said after Saturday's game. "We
got out to those first two touch-
downs in the second half, and the
thoughts were definitely there."
But the 24-0 halftime deficit
proved too much for Michigan's
porous defense and its too-little-
too-late offensive push, as Wis-
consin (10-1 overall, 7-1 Big Ten)
absolutely pounded the Wolver-
ines on the ground - tallying the
most rushing yards against Michi-
gan all season - to win 48-28. The

Each Saturday, the receivers
have treated the Michigan football
game like their own personal con-
test.
Who's going to have the most
catches? The most yards? The most
touchdown receptions?
Essentially, it's a question of who
gets to have the big game and the
headlines.
Against Wisconsin, it wasn't the
receiver with the most catches or
yards who stood out. It was junior
Darryl Stonum, who made the two
biggest catches of the game.
After Michigan's offense limped

through a scoreless first half on
Saturday, it was in need of a spark
entering the second half.
So the Wolverines opened the
third quarter with a methodical
march through Wisconsin territo-
ry, and then, on second down with
seven yards to go, sophomore quar-
terback Denard Robinson floated
a ball toward the right side of the
endzone. Stonum snatched it for
Michigan's first touchdown of the
game.
And 24-7 felt much more sur-
mountable than 24-0.
Three plays later, senior Jonas
Mouton recovered affumble and the
Wolverines got the ball back.

Meram continues tear Michigan moves on to Sweet 16


* tnrougn postseason,

By ZACH HELFAND
DailySports Writer
As the No. 19 Michigan men's
soccer team entered the second
half of its second-round NCAA
Tournament game against Cen-
tral Florida yesterday trailing by
a goal, the quickly approaching
reality of a premature end to the
season began to dawn upon the
2,791 in attendance at the U-M
Soccer Complex.
Michigan coach Steve Burns
said he expected the crowd to be
a little nervous.
But not his team, and espe-
cially not senior forward Justin
Meram.
"I actually thought we were
going to put one or two away in
the first half. We were just down
their throats after they scored,"

Meram said after the victory. "At
halftime, Coach said, 'It's gonna
come, just stay composed and
let's not worry about it and justgo
into the second half at 0-0.' And
that's what we did."
It was Meram, after all, who
eased some of the tension for the
Michigan faithful when his shot
in the 50th minute found the
back of the net to knot the score,
1-1. For a player known for cre-
ating goals with his fancy foot-
work, this goal came naturally
for Meram.
A perfect lead pass from senior
midfielder Alex Wood found
Meram one-on-one with UCF
keeper Shawn Doyle. All that was
left for Meram to do was finish.
Meram has been doing a lot
of that lately- letting the goals

Goodbye to the Big House,
don't forget the good times

As a left my house for the
Big House before the final
home game of 2010on
Saturday, the
nostalgia hit
me like a brick
wall.
Instead of y.
taking Fifth
Street straight '
toward the sta-
dium, I took a-RYAN
detour. It was a KAT
pretty special KARTJE
day after all -
my lastgame in
the Big House as a student, every
senior's last game in the Big House
as a student - soI headed for State
Street.
Like many of you seniors, my
mind immediately flashed back to
freshman year. The first time I saw
State Street at its finest. The first
time I walked past Bongo man.
The first time I took a beer bong
from the third story of a stranger's
apartment.
It was still the spectacle on
Saturdaythat it was before that
first game, when we all excitedly
walked to see Michigan - the No.
5 team in the nation at the time -
blow out a 1-AA school from Boone,
North Carolina that I'd only briefly
heard of during the 2000 NCAA
Men's Basketball Tournament.
And when that didn't happen,
we all survived Black Saturday. We
survived when Michigan lost the
next game to Oregon and started
its season 0-2 for only the second
time in our lifetime. And we sur-
vived when we lost one of the ugli-
est Ohio State games in the history
of the rivalry.
And to think, Michigan finished
that season 9-4.
We've all done a whole lot of
surviving in the past four years.
And none of it has been easy.
When Lloyd Carr left, it was
supposed to be Les Miles who
held the reins of Michigan's most
beloved athletic program. Then, it
was supposed to be Greg Schiano.
But finally, it was Rich Rodriguez,

a spread offense genius from the
heart of Appalachia.
It was a fiasco of a coaching
search that left us all wonder-
ing where Michigan football was
going. Then, when we saw the
direction, most of us wished we
could turn back.
The next few seasons went by
at a painful snail's pace. We sur-
vived a 3-9 team led by a quarter-
back who didn't fit in Rodriguez's
offense and a defense that looked
like it couldn't get worse.
And then Tate Forcier, an
18-year-old signal caller from San
Diego, was deemed "savior" of the
program. He led Michigan to a4-0
start last season as a true fresh-
man. He was on Heisman watch

Michigan State, then Iowa, then
Penn State. And as we left the Big
House for the final time on Satur-
day, we left having endured four of
the most painful years in Michigan
football history.
But we made it.
Now that the experience is over,
there's absolutely no reason to sulk.
So what if Michigan finished 16-14
at home during your four years.
With the exception of a few Sat-
urdays in the last football season
(I'm looking at you, Northwestern
2009), you probably had a great
time at Michigan Stadium, win or
lose.
Sure, the football team owes us,
its loyal following, a whole lot of
appreciation for the last four years.
But what would your college expe-
rience have been without Denard
Robinson? Without a 112-point,
triple-overtime win over Illinois?
or without a last-second failed
two-point conversion to beat Wis-
consin in 2008?
What would it have been with-

out the "We Own Penn State"
chant when we beat the Nittany
Lions in 2007? Or Tate's final drive
to beat Notre Dame last season? Or
the look on Tim Tebow's face when
Michigan smashed Florida into the
ground in the Capital One Bowl?
I know there's little hope of me
convincing you that the last four
years have been a success. Even I
would be kidding myself if I told
you that.
But when all is said and done
and the Wolverines leave Colum-
bus next week, win or lose, don't
feel sorry for yourself. Don't talk
about how unlucky you were to see
the worst four years in Michigan
football history.
Instead, remember those few
moments when that team, your
team, made you feel like no other
sports team can.
Because, in the end, win or lose,
few others have fought as hard as
we have tobe Michigan fans.
And for that, you should be
pretty damn proud.

Freshman center Jordan Mor-

continued to assert himself as the
team's top center option. Morris
targeted him in the paint often
against a weak Gardner-Webb
frontcourt, and Morgan tallied a
season-high 20 points and eight
boards.

said. "He's learning how to fake,
he's feeling the people around him
and he's a very intelligent player.
He's an engineering student, doing
very well. I like his growth."
Morgan looked solid on the
defensive end as well, stifling a
number of drives to the hoop. Late
in the first half, Gardner-Webb
forward Josh Henley received
a pass in the paint, but Morgan
was right there to blanket him. As
Henley struggled to find options,
he was called for a 3-second viola-
tion, and Morgan earned a stand-
ing ovation from the Wolverine
faithful.
Freshman forward Tim Hard-
away Jr. also had a solid day with
15 points, including two buckets
from behind the arc. But for the
second straight game, he found
himself in a bit of foul trouble
early on.
Just a couple minutes into
the game, he picked up his first
personal foul and temporarily
checked out of the game.
"I'm not getting frustrated
- it's just a learning process,"
Hardaway said. "(The coaches)
probably just want to teach me
a lesson to not foul because that
was a stupid foul."
Ironically, the Wolverines
shot a season-high 52.4 per-
cent against the Bulldogs, even
though their veteran leader
- junior shooting guard Zack
Novak - was 0-for-4 from the
field.
Then again, Beilein said all
offseason that the team would
embrace a wide variety of scor-
ing options following the depar-
ture of All-Big Ten stars Manny
Harris and DeShawn Sims from

"It's a good feeling," Novak
said. "I think that just helps
everybody to be that much more
relaxed when they're shooting
because you know if you're not
hitting, it's going to be tough
to stop everybody on this team
from hitting."
With the win, Beilein picked
up his 600th career victory,
with Michigan greats Jalen Rose
(1992-94), Jimmy King (1992-95)
and Ray Jackson (1992-95) of the
infamous "Fab Five" in atten-

more than most teams heading
into the Wolverines' final regular
season game.
Sophomore defensive end
Craig Roh suffered concussion-
like symptoms during the loss.
Neither junior running back
Mike Shaw nor redshirt fresh-
man left tackle Taylor Lewan
played due to concussion-like
symptoms. And junior wide
receiver Darryl Stonum, who had
four catches for 99 yards, was
carted off the field in the fourth
quarter with a right ankle injury.
Junior defensive tackle Mike
Martin was also slowed by ankle
injuries. It's hard to find a healthy
defensive player who was listed

on the preseason roster.
"CraigRoh, Mike Martin, Dar-
ryl Stonum - the list goes on,"
Michigan coach Rich Rodriguez
said. "It's just one of those crazy
years. I've never had a year with
this many guys (injured) in key
positions in certain spots, but
that's where you're at. The next
guy in has to come in. For us,
we're just not at the point where
we can take an experienced play-
er out and put an experienced
player in. There's a lot of inexpe-
rience out there."
LYTLE PASSES AWAY: Former
Michigan All-American running
back Rob Lytle passed away due
to a heart attack on Saturday

night in Fremont, Ohio. He was
56.
"Rob was a teammate and a
terrific individual," Michigan
Athletic Director Dave Brandon
said through a press release.
"It's a sad day because we've
lost someone who was a great
example of a Michigan man. Our
sympathies go out to his family
during this difficult time."
Lytle finished third in the
Heisman Trophy voting during
the 1976 season and when he left
Michigan, his 3,317 career rush-
ing yards was the single-season
record for a Wolverine at the
time. Mike Hart is the current
all-time rushing leader.

STONUM
From Page 1B
On the offense's first play, Rob-
inson tossed a 34-yard pass to Sto-
num, who shielded the defender
from the underthrown ball and
caught it over his shoulder.
In less than two minutes, Sto-
num had given the Wolverine
offense exactly what it needed - a
spark.
BADGERS
From Page 1B
victory was Wisconsin's first in
the Big House since 1994 and the
Badgers' second consecutive win
over Michigan for the first time
since then, too.
"We certainly didn't play
well," Rodriguez said. "We didn't
tackle well. We didn't catch the
ball well. We didn't execute on
either side of the ball at times.
You do that against a good team,
you're going to get beat."
The first half was a forget-
table one for both Michigan's
offense and defense, as the Wol-
verines (7-4, 2-4) registered just
124 yards to Wisconsin's 379.
Sophomore quarterback Denard
Robinson was completely sty-

"It helped to see him make
plays," offensive coordinator Cal-
vin Magee said after the game.
"We were trying to get the ball
to Junior (Hemingway) also, but
Stonum got the coverage that was
favorable. Denard did a good job
finding him."
Teammates said they appreci-
ated what Stonum added to the
offense - big plays from a player
who loves to make them.
"He definitely brings the big-
mied by Wisconsin's brute front
seven, going for 22 yards on 4-of-
10 passing
Meanwhile, the Badger
offense seemed to be toying with
Michigan's defense, even with-
out junior ballcarrier John Clay,
who missed the game with an
MCL sprain.
Clay's backups, sophomore
Montee Ball and freshman James
White, were still too much for
Michigan's defensive front to
handle, as they combined for 187
yards in the first half alone.
It was Wisconsin coach Bret
Bielema's plan all along - run,
run and run some more - and it
was working to perfection.
"There wasn't anything they
could do to slow that down,"
Bielema said.
But in the second half, Robin-

play ability for our offense," junior
tight end Kevin Koger said. "He's a
big threat at any time in the game."
Stonum's playmaking oppor-
tunities increased as he played
a larger role on special teams on
Saturday. He returned four kick-
offs for 103 yards. After Michi-
gan's recent struggles in the
return game, Stonum's sure hands
were a welcome sight for Wolver-
ine fans.
"He does it all," Koger said,
son showed flashes of his early-
season self and a little bit of the
Wolverines' 2008 magic shined
through.
With 11:03 remaining in the
third quarter, Robinson lobbed
a beautiful ball toward the south
endzone where junior wideout
Darryl Stonum took advantage
of man-to-man coverage and
pulled down the Wolverines' first
touchdown of the day.
Then, after Badger wide-
out Isaac Anderson coughed
up a fumble and the Wolver-
ines recovered, Robinson threw
another deep pass to Stonum to
set up his own 4-yard touchdown
scamper. Suddenly, down just 10
points now, another comeback
was in reach.
But Bielema stuck to the game-
plan: expose Michigan's biggest

smiling. "He's versatile and he can
do a lot of things on the field to
help our team."
On his final kick return,
though, he got hit hard while
trying to twist away from a Wis-
consin defender. His right ankle
received the brunt of the hit, and
he crumpled over in pain, clutch-
ing his right leg.
The injury, if serious, would be
a big blow to the Wolverine pass-
ing game. It would also be just
weakness on defense - funda-
mental tackling.
"We were emphasizing that
in practice: that we were going
to have to make players miss
because of the kind of defense
they run," Ball said. "There are
a lot of open bodies. ... We knew
that they miss a lot of tackles."
Bielema didn't call a pass play
for the rest of the game after that,
instead opting for 33 straight run
plays.
After focusing on running
through loose tackles all week in
practice, his backs ran through
and around Michigan's defense,
as White finished with 181 yards
to Ball's 173, and the two com-
bined for six touchdowns on the
ground.
The Badgers' 170 yards rush-
ing in the second half overshad-

another injury on what is turning
into quite a long list of wounded
players on Michigan's roster.
"He's not banged up too bad I
don't think," running backs coach
Fred Jackson said. "He'll be ready
to go this week to try to give us a
chance next Saturday."
Stonum tweeted a few hours
after the game: "Hopefully I'm ok
(I think I am) but its gonna take
a whole lot to keep me out of this
next game."this next game."
owed Robinson's record-setting
effort - he passed Air Force's
Beau Morgan for the most rush
yards by an NCAA quarterback
in a single season (1,538 yards in
1996).
A different Michigan record,
though - a more somber one -
was more telling of the losing
effort and the season as a whole.
After allowing 558 total yards
and 48 points to Wisconsin's
offense, this year's Michigan
defense has officially allowed the
most yards and points in a season
in program history - with one
game still remaining.
"They just pounded us," red-
shirt sophomore safety Jordan
Kovacs said. "We're disappointed
with the way that we played, but
we're moving on, and we have a
big game next week."

SWEET 16
From Page 1B
Doyle.
Meram, who extended his
goal streak to six games, attrib-
uted his recent success to his
partners in crime. He and the
Saad brothers refer to them-
selves as the "three amigos."
"At first, I was trying to
score on my own," Meram said.
"Now, I've changed my outlook
on everything. With Soony and
Hamoody on the attack ... no
team can defend all three of
us."
Following the equalizer,
the game's momentum swung
away from Michigan - much
in part to several seemingly
impossible saves by Doyle.
The back-and-forth, up-
tempo nature of the game con-
tinued to the end of regulation
when the score remained dead-
locked.
"We really needed to get
balls into our forwards' feet,"
Burns said. "We just felt we'd
get a rhythm and get a lot more
chances."
After a Central Florida foul,
such an opportunity presented
itself.Hamoody launched the
free kick from 35 yards out
toward the goal, and just as the
over-capacity crowd thought

Doyle would make another one
of his signature saves, sopho-
more midfielder Latif Alashe
tipped it in for the game-win-
ner.
"We just got lucky on that
one and got it to actually go
in," Alashe said. "(Doyle) made
a few great saves earlier. The
luck just went our way, and it
went in the net."
The Michigan Ultras - the
Wolverines' dedicated student
section - exploded as Michi-
gan made the field of 16. A huge
following was present at the
game and the enthusiasm of
the group hardly went unno-
ticed by the Wolverines or the
opposition.
"It's great for college soc-
cer," Knights head coach Bryan
Cunningham said.
Michigan's next opponent,
South Carolina, also squeaked
by on Sunday. The seventh-
seeeded Gamecocks broke a
scoreless tie in overtime to
defeat Duke.
This upcoming Sunday, in
Columbia, S.C., the Wolverines
will have their hands full. But,
unless South Carolina can do
somethingthat few others have
done and shut down the "three
amigos," Michigan may very
well pull a minor upset of its
own and continue its tourna-
ment run.

MERAM
From Page 1B
come to him.
"At first, I was trying to score
on my own per se, and now I've
changed my outlook on every-
thing," Meram said. "With Soony
and Hamoody and us three in the
attack ... just the combination of
us doing what we do best, no team
can defend all three of us."
The goal was Meram's eighth
in his past six games, including
one game-tying and one go-ahead
goal.

Excluding the game against
Wisconsin in which he didn't play,
Meram has scored at least one
goal in every game since his two-
goal performance against Bowl-
ing Green on Oct. 27.
Meram sent the game into
overtime largely because the the
Wolverines maintained their
composure, even while facing the
possibility of elimination.
"It didn't have the feel of one of
those games," Burns said. "Some-
times there's a feeling when a
team is just throwing bodies in
front of the ball, the keepers on
fire. ... From a fan's perspective,

I think you could get pretty tight
and say, 'Oh, this might not be
Michigan's day.' But it never felt
like that on the bench, and on the
field, these guys certainly didn't
play like that."
Had Meram failed to convert
his open try, though, it would have
been hard to avoid such feelings.
But Meram, a senior, knew
exactly what was at stake.
When asked if he knew what
he had to do to keep his collegiate
career alive, Meram didn't hesi-
tate.
His response?
"Score."

Michigan's vaunted offense was non-existent in
the first half, racking up only 22 yards passing and
102 yards rushing on its way to being shut out. But
the Wolverines picked it up in the second half and
finished with 442 yards of offense and 28 points.

Rich Rods

At the podium after the game on Saturday, Rich
Rodriguez was fed up. He got animated lament-
ing the fact that he was playing five freshmen on
defense, and how his entire team has been rav-
aged by injuries at wide receiver and cornerback.

LOOKING GOOD

FEELING BLUE

SOOHOMORE QUARTERBACK DENARD ROBINSON
Another game, another record broken by Denard
Robinson. With the 132 yards he gained on the
ground on Saturday against Wisconsin, Robinson
broke the NCAA record for most rushing yards by
a quatterback in a season. Ever. The record was
previously held by Beau Morgan of Air Force. He
also became the first player to ever pass and run
for more than 1500 yards in a season. As always,
the success hasn't gone to the quarterback's
head, When asked about it after the game,
Robinson looked at the reporter like he'd just
asked him to wear an Ohio State sweatshirt. The
sophomore was also an efficient 16-of-25 through
the air for 239 yards and two touchdowns.

ARIEL BOND/Dait
DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR GREG ROBINSON
Here we go again. Yes, we were lauding the
improvements in the defense from the Illinois
game and then against Purdue, when they didn't
let the Boilermakers score an offensive touchdown.
On Saturday against Wisconsin ... can you say
regression? The linebackers once again couldn't
tackle anyone and neither could the inexprienced
defensive backfield. The run defense especially
suffered. The Badgers only passed the ball once
in the second half and the Wolverines never came
close to stopping either James White or Montee
Ball. A lot of the issues may be execution, but we're
pointing the finger anyway: Robinson, this is your
fault. (Oh, and he still won't speak to the media.)

.

After Michigan scored 14 unanswered points, Wisconsin responded
with another rushing touchdown with 5:31 remaining in the third quar-
ter to reclaim command of the game. Wisconsin running back James
White took the handoff and went off tackle to the left. Badgers tackle
Gabe Carimi and guard John Moffitt pulled and got out in front to block
for White down field as the Wisconsin tight end blocked the Michigan
defensive end. White broke one tackle and sprinted to the endzone
for a 23-yard touchdown run to give the Badgers a 31-14 lead. White
finished the game with 181 yards rushing and two touchdowns.


NOTABLE

We didn't tackle
