In a briefing for the Universi-
ty's executive officers and deans
yesterday morning, the chair
of the Higher Learning Com-
mission del-

announced
that his com-
mittee would A

The Michi-
gan Daily was given exclusive
access to the meeting, where
Celestino Fernandez, who was
chairing the HLC's delegation
to University, said the commit-
tee will suggest the University
be reaccredited, adding that the
final decision will be made by the
HLC's Board of Trustees later
this year.

Though Fernandez told the
approximately 30 University offi-
cials and fellow HLC committee
members at the briefing that the
HLC site visit committee had
found a great deal of evidence
that the University is meeting or
exceeding standards set forth by
the HLC, he said the University
should examine its commitment
to diversity.
During the process of reac-
creditation review, the Univer-
sity is evaluated by the HLC on
five key criteria areas - how the
University fulfills its mission, the
University's plan for the future,
the quality of the classroom
educational experience, campus
community engagement outside
the classroom and the way in
which the University serves and
interacts with members of the
campus community.
Fernandez said, if anything;
the University officials "under-
stated" the University's perfor-
mance in their self study report
- a document that compiles
information from across campus
on the University's operations
to help both University officials
and HLC representatives better
understand if and how the Uni-
versity is meeting standards.
However, Fernandez did say

Supporters say plan
wouldn't spell huge
job losses for banks
By BETHANY BIRON
and MIKE MERAR
Daily StaffReporters
Legislation currently awaiting
a vote in the Senate, which calls
for student loans to come directly
from the government - instead of

through private lenders subsidized
by the government - is facing
severe opposition from banks and
other private lenders concerned
that if the bill passes they could see
their revenues plummet.
But despite the criticism of the
proposed legislation, support-
ers, including those in President
Barack Obama's administration,
are lauding the change, saying it is
crucial in helping students afford
to attend college. In addition sup-
porters of the bill say they believe

the student loan industry doesn't
stand to lose as much money or as
many jobs as critics claim.
Mike Kantrowiz, publisher and
creator of Finaid.org - a website
with information on financial aid
- said the legislation would help
students by allowing them to go
directly through their school to
receive a loan, but that the bill is
not without criticism.
"There has obviously been a lot
of lobbying going on behind the
scenes," Kantrowitz said.

Rich Williams, higher educa-
tion associate for the U.S. Public
Interest Research Group, also
noted that banks heavily oppose
the bill because of the possibility of
losing the money they receive from
the government to back the loans.
"The banks, receiving all of
these subsidies, really want to hold
on to that money," he said.
Thomas Kelly, a spokesman for
JPMorgan Chase, said the bank
has had to prepare for the possibil-

Graffiti Alley - a small space
next to The Michigan Theater on
East Liberty Street - is one of the
most colorful places in Ann Arbor,

with walls covered top to bottom
in paint from various graffiti art-
ists.
While Graffiti Alley is consid-
ered a kind of haven for graffiti
tags, the spread of graffiti around
the city has become a major con-
cern for property owners, prompt-
ing the Ann Arbor City Council to
unanimously pass an anti-graffiti
ordinance in January 2009.
The results of the ordinance,
which went into effect in May
2009, have yet to be reviewed by
City Council members, though

council members say there
appears to be some positive feed-
back about the ordinance's effect
on the city.
The ordinance requires prop-
erty owners to remove graffiti
within seven to nine days of the
time of an issued notification
from the city. It also allows for a
less severe punishment for prop-
erty owners, who are required

Program offers
online courses to
help baby-boomers
reinvent careers
By CAITLIN HUSTON
Daily StaffReporter
in an effort to help unem-
ployed baby-boomers who lost
their jobs as a result of Michi-
gan's down economy, a University

professor has created a new pro-
gram, which provides resources
geared toward baby-boomers to
help them get their employment
search back on track.
Launched two weeks ago, the
LEARN program is a series of
free online courses designed to
teach workers and baby-boomers
how to reinvent their careers.
Currently the program - a joint
collaboration between the Ross
School of Business, the Maria
Madeline Project Inc., five Michi-
gan libraries and WJBK/FOX 2

News - offers eight health care
courses.
Lynn Wooten, a professor in
the Business School, said she
was interested in becoming a co-
creator of the LEARN program
because of the need recently for
career resources for unemployed
workers in the state.
"I really envisioned it as a
service to our state to think
about how do we help workers
transition into this new econo-
my," she said.

Hospice Student Companions

Though many pre-health students
spend much of their time focused on
acing their organic chemistry exams
and MCATS, one student group is
working to give them a way to spend
their free time that may help in their
future careers.
Founded during the 2007-2008
school year, Hospice Student Com-
panions allows students to volunteer
at nursing homes and work with hos-
pice patients.
The goal of the group is to make
students more aware of patients liv-
ing in hospice, and to create an arena
for students to volunteer their ser-
vices, according to LSA senior Anna
Chase, co-founder and president of
Hospice Student Companions.
The club works with the Howell-
based nursing home, the Howell Care
Center, where volunteers visitpatients,
most of whom are 85 years of age and
older and are given six months or less
to live, according to Chase. Some stu-

dents also visit hospice patients in
their ownhomes, she said.
Prior to the club's formation,
working with hospice patients was
typically an option reserved only for
pre-med students. Chase said the club
was created so that all students who
express an interest in the medical
field can volunteer.
"The actual volunteer work is my
favorite," Chase said. "I love when
you walk into the room and see the
patient light up and smile."
The club has about 40 members
who are trained to become hospice
volunteers by professionals from in-
House Hospice, located in Southfield,
Mich.
Chase said student volunteers play
an important role in hospice patients'
lives by providing them with com-
panionship. Most volunteers work
one-on-one with a patient once a
week. During this time they talk, play
cards or help the patient create a "life

review," which is a journal document-
ing the patient's life memories.
In addition to educating the cam-
pus community on the importance
of hospice patients through the club,
Chase also said she hopes to organize
seminars on grief management to
educate the community.
Kinesiology junior Christina
Monolo, a member of Hospice Student
Companions, volunteers at the Hill-
side Terrace Nursing Home. Monolo,
a pre-med student, said she wanted
to get volunteer experience working
with patients but was hesitant to vol-
unteer at a hospital because she want-
ed to work directly with the patients
rather than do remedial tasks.
"I wanted to volunteer with hos-
pice patients because I wanted to
be the last impression on their life,"
Monolo said. "My favorite part of vol-
unteering is being the highlightof the
patient's week and makingtheir day."

Obama says nuclear
Iran could trigger

President Barack Obama says a
nuclear-armed Iran could trigger an
arms race in the Middle East, some-
thing his administration wants to
avnid.
Obama told Fox News Channel's
Bret Baier that keeping Tehran
without a nuclear weapon is one of
his highest priorities. Baier asked
Obama if a nuclear-armed Tehran
would be a failure of his administra-
tion. Obama's reply was to empha-
size work already under way among
international partners to isolate
Iran.
Iran has accelerated its nuclear
program despite previous U.N. pen-
alties, but the United States and
some of its allies say a renewed dem-
onstration of world resolve could
finally push Iran to negotiate.

A court in northern China has

Huang Songyou, former vice

es, part of a continuing battle by
the Communist Party against deep-
seated corruption.
The Hebei Province People's
High Court yesterday upheld the
life sentence handed down by a
lower court in January, the Legal
Evening News reported. Huang had
no reaction after the decision was
announced, the newspaper said, cit-

Huang, 52, was accused of tak-

Huang was fired and expelled
from the Communist Party in

Men face up to life in
prison for allegedly
planning attacks
ISLAMABAD (AP) - A Paki-
stani court charged five young
Americans yesterday with plan-
ningterroristattacks inthe South
Asian country and conspiring to
wage war against nations allied
with Pakistan, their defense law-
yer said.
The men - all Muslims from
the Washington suburb of Alex-
andria, Virginia - pleaded not
guilty to a total of five charges,
the most severe of which car-
ries a maximum sentence of life
in prison, defense lawyer Hasan
Dastagir told The Associated
Press.
"My clients were in good shape
and high spirits," Dastagir said.
The men, all in their late teens

or early 20s, were charged by
an anti-terrorism court inside
a prison in Sargodha, the city
in Punjab province where they
were arrested in December.
They were reported missing by
their families in November after
one left behind a farewell video
showing scenes of war and casu-
alties and saying Muslims must
be defended.
Their lawyer has said they
were heading to Afghanistan
and had no plans to stage attacks
inside Pakistan.
The court also charged the
men with planning attacks on
Afghan and U.S. territory, said
Dastagir. The charges did not
specify what was meant by U.S.
territory but could be a reference
to American bases or diplomatic
outposts in Afghanistan.
The men also were charged
with contributing cash to
banned organizations to be used

for terrorism and with directing
each other to commit terrorist
acts.
"This last charge carries life
in prison while the rest of the
charges have lesser punish-
ments," Dastagir said.
The trial will begin on March
31, and the prosecution is slated
to present more than 20 witness-
es, Dastagir said.
The defense plans to bring
witnesses from the U.S. and pro-
vide evidence of community ser-
vice carried out by the men back
home, Dastagir said.
Pakistani police have publicly
made several accusations against
the young men, claiming the sus-
pects contacted Pakistani-based
jihadi groups. They accused the
five of using the social network-
ing site Facebook and video-shar-
ing site YouTube while they were
in the U.S. to try to connect with
extremist groups in Pakistan.

Requiring repatriation
'U' should return Native American remains
ver the course of the last two decades, University officials,
students and Native American organizations have been
locked in a controversial debate over museum artifacts
deemed "culturally unidentifiable." But this week, the debate over
these artifacts at the University's Museum of Anthropology may
finally advancing after years of gridlock. Recent changes to the 1990
Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act will force
museums, including those at the University, to re-evaluate "cultur-
ally unidentifiable" remains and return them to the Native Ameri-
can community. The University should act in a timely manner and
return the 1,390 "culturally unidentifiable" remains it currently
possesses to the appropriate Native American groups.

This watchdog is ticked

f you're a regular reader of this
column, you know that some-
thing might be wrong with you.
But you also
know that some-
thing might be
wrong with the
University, too. ;
And you know that
I'm a watchdog of
the University. You
know that if some-
thing isn't right,
I will loudly alert WILL
others of the prob-
lem, in hopes that GRUNDLER
they will make it
go away. This is
what beinga watchdog is all about.
Well, something isn't right. In fact,
everything is wrong. I am referring
to, of course, the tour groups that are
all over campus. PLEASE STOP THE
TOURS. The Daily will double what
you are making to stop, tour guides!
E-mail my editor for details!
No, I am kidding. The tours aren't
the problem. They are only part of
the problem. A lot of bad things have
been happening on campus ever
since the weather turned unnaturally
warm, and not just smarty professors
telling us "We told you so" about cli-
mate change.
Actually, one bad thing happened
off-campus. Like thousands of other
students whose sole reason for exis-
tence is Michigan sports, I was shak-
en beyond measure last Friday when
the basketball team lost to Ohio State
after a buzzer-beater. Our - and by
"our" I mean "the basketball team's"
- last chance to make a miracle run
to the NCAA Tournament was shat-
tered, and now we - and by "we" I
mean "the basketball team" - are
not even in the NIT. This is just an
embarrassment. I mean, why do the
sports teams think students go to
school here in the first place?
It gets worse. If you thought our

athleticswere a jokeyou'll be pleased
to know that our faculty thinks the
LAW is a joke. I'm referring to last
week's traffic violation by Vice Presi-
dent of Student Affairs E. Royster
Harper and University President
Mary Sue Coleman, who were caught
speeding to Bursley Hall. Accord-
ing to a report on Daily's news blog,
E. Royster Harper, who was driving,
had the nerve to tell the police officer,
"Don't you know who I'm with?" To
teach hera lesson, the officer ordered
her out of the car, cuffed her and
yelled repeatedly, "Whatndoes the
"E" stand for!? Huh? No one knows!
Edith? Eleanor!? What gives!?"
This last exchange hasn't been ver-
ified, but nonetheless the vice presi-
dent of student affairs thinks joking
with an officer of the law is morally
acceptable.
So, to recap, tour groups, athlet-
ics and administrators - one would
hope the embarrassment would end
there. One would hope, as a Wolver-
ine, that one could hold one's head
up high and say, without a shred of
sarcasm, "At least we'll always have
our student government." Indeed,
in turbid times, the Michigan Stu-
dent Assembly has always been a last
vestige of respectability. No longer.
The recent website scandal has torn
the very fabric of MSA and its many,
many faithful supporters apart.
At first I thought the website scan-
dal stemmed from the fact that when
you google "MSA," the Michigan
Student Assembly website doesn't
appear until page two, after such
organizations as the Michigan Snow-
mobile Association and the Miner-
alogical Society of America. MSA,
of course, is way more relevant than
these trash organizations, and should
really have the top spot in the Google
results (currently held by Mine Safe-
tyAppliances Company). But THEN I
discovered the real scandal: MSA was
buildinga NEW website (presumably

to overtake Mine Safety Appliances)
and went over its budget by $6,000,
for a total of $9,000 on a site that still
doesn't work.

We're in the midst
of dark days here
at the University.

As reported by the Daily yesterday, a com-
mittee representing NAGPRA approved an
alteration to the initial 1990 legislation on
Monday. Under NAGPRA, museums are
obligated to keep public record of Native
American artifacts in their possession.
The changes approved on Monday would
require museums to inform nearby tribes of
where "culturally unidentifiable" remains
were unearthed. Based on that informa-
tion, Native American tribes may request
the return of the artifacts. The change will
take effect on May 14 and will be followed
by a 60-day comment period. Under the new
rules, the University's Museum of Anthro-
pology will be required to re-examine the
1,390 artifacts in its collection.
The University has refused to take
action to return "culturally unidentifi-
able" remains to Native American groups
for years. Since NAGPRA's inception in
1990, the University has been repeatedly
asked to re-examine its Native American
remains by tribes hoping to find remains of
members of their groups. And though the
University returned a fraction of its human
remains, along with other artifacts, to
Native American tribes in 2005, the Uni-
versity has still failed to act upon other
"unidentifiable" artifacts. But this cultural
insensitivity is unacceptable. The Univer-
sity should take more aggressive action to
identify and return the artifacts.

While the University may feel the pos-
session of these remains is important for
research and educational initiatives, it can't
simply ignore the request of Native Ameri-
can groups to regain ownership of their
history. Native American groups at the Uni-
versity have been fighting for decades for
the proper return of these artifacts, and the
University has unacceptably taken exces-
sive efforts to avoid fulfilling its legal obliga-
tion to do so. The University has an ethical
responsibility to stop dragging its feet and
return the property that rightfully belongs
to Native American tribes.
The battle between the University and
Native American groups has been long
and contentious. But with the passing of
new NAGPRA regulations, the University
now has no excuse for its inaction. It must
make more efforts to return the artifacts.
And now the University has an opportuni-
ty to put the controversy behind them and
return the artifacts without undue delay.
Making sure that these artifacts are
returned in a timely fashion won't make
up for the delay, but it will help establish
a beneficial relationship between the Uni-
versity and Native American groups. This
would herald an important step towards
the reconciliation between the two par-
ties while still allowing the University to
continue its research - without hoarding
anyone's heritage.

During the outrage that followed,
many students experienced intenise
psychological and physiological reac-
tions: shock, disbelief, disgust, loss of
appetite, loss of purpose and rashes.
I think I threw up - though I con-
fess I can't remember exactly what
happened. For the first time in MSA
history, it failed to accomplish whatit
had set out to do.
In my previous columns about the
moral shortcomings of this institu-
tion we all love, Ihave urged students
to not let these types of things get
to them and to instead focus on aca-
demics. But who comes here for the
academics? I realize now that this is
a shallow solution at best. I realize
now that as I pass those infuriating
tour groups, and those infuriating
tour guides - with their little yellow
jackets on, standing on some bench -
I want to stuff a brochure down the
guide's throat and yell to the group,
"What's wrong with you? Can't you
see what a failure this place is? How
do you think you'll get a job after-
ward, with no athletic presence in
theBig Ten and astudentgovernment
who can't even enact a website?"
I guess this is why I see so many
students getting drunk on the week-
ends. These are dark days.

Time to modernize gendered housing

6

Perhaps you've seen someone on the Diag
holding a sign that says "God Loves Every-
one (Yes, including the gays)." And perhaps
he's told you "God bless you, and have a good
day." If you haven't taken the time to speak to
him, you should. He's a pretty nice guy. I know
because I am that guy.
If you count yourself among those that are
confused by my message, don't be ashamed,
you're not alone. Some-people wonder, "How
can a person who is openly gay be a devout and
true Christian?" Answering this question in its
entirety can't be done in the 800 word limit of
this viewpoint, but it's not as simple as saying
"Read Leviticus 18:22 and it's written plain as
day. Homosexuality is just wrong!"
I often (perhaps too frequently) have this
debate with individuals who claim to be "true
Christians." Every time someone thinks theBible
condemns homosexuality, they are coming from
a philosophy that views the Bible as the inerrant
and infallible word of God. The simple response
to these objections is that the Bible just isn't iner-
rant or infallible. One only need observe verses
like Ephesians 6:5 (which condones slavery) or
Matthew 15:4 (which commands parents to killI
the children that disrespect them with a rod) to
realize that the Bible is not perfect, and that it has
some questionable things to say. However, I do
believe that the Bible contains the word of God.
It's just a matter of analyzing the Bible's many
verses critically and with this core philosophy at
the forefront of your mind: Love your neighbor
as yourself.
Using the Bible to disparage any group of
people, including gays, is a dangerous misuse
of the text. Using God as an excuse to hate any
group of people is not only wrong, but is one
of the main reasons that the religious are in
such poor standing among the agnostic and the
atheist. And religious people should care about
what the faithless think about them.
For an extended discussion of these ques-
tions and the issues that they raise, I encourage
students to attend the 2010 TBLG Interfaith
Conference this Saturday, . Mar. 20 from 12
p.m. to 5 p.m. at the Dana Building. It's being
organized by Spectrum of Faiths, an Inter-

faith LGBT organization at the campus. The
aim of the organization and the conference
in general is to help shed some light on these
issues and allow for a different kind of discus-
sion that doesn't end with, "Well, if it's in the
Bible, that's the way it is, and there's no point
in debating it even further." The issue is deep-
er and more complex than that. Additionally,
the conference will address how other faiths,
including Judaism and Islam, are handling
these issues related to sexual orientation and
gender expression. Attending this conference
is a valuable opportunity to learn about the
important role that faith can and does play in
the lives of gays and lesbians.
The bottom line is that if you believe in a lov-
ing God (which I do) and if you believe that God
holds love higher than all other values, there
is no credible way you can object to the genu-
ine love that two people, of any sexual orienta-
tion, have for one another. That also includes
romantic love. Perhaps you don't think that
homosexuals are capable of displayingthis kind
of love. I know many a street preacher that hold
this view. Maybe they think that gay and lesbian
love is not really love, but rather a misplaced lust
that can only manifest itself sexually and pro-
miscuously with the aid of crystal meth. I can
assure them that this view is fundamentally
flawed, and I often find that the people in some
of the most loving, committed and long lasting
relationships, are gay. In the great majority of
cases, they don't even have the official bonds of
marriage keeping them together. Their relation-
ship is sustained in its entirety by the passion-
ate commitment that they have for one another,
and I can find fewer things in life more beauti-
ful than that. The thought of God rejecting this
kind of love is illogical and inconsistent with the
one central commandment: Love your neighbor
as yourself (Romans 13:8).
I encourage you as students of this great
University to learn more about these issues,
and continue to find ways to accept LGBT indi-
viduals into the fabric of your communities,
both secular and spiritual.

This week, the Residence Hall Association will be con-
ducting a survey of current residents in order to gauge
student interest in creating a gender-neutral housing
option in the residence halls. I encourage all eligible resi-
dents to respond to the survey to give Housing an accu-
rate portrayal of the community's opinions.
Gender-neutral housing means that Housing residents
would have the option to choose a roommate they would
like, regardless of gender. Two people of different gen-
ders could live in the same room. Gender-neutral housing
would be offered in specific areas within the residence
halls, in addition to the single-sex and co-ed floors that
already exist. The proposed policies aren't meant to elim-
inate housing choices or force residents into housing situ-
ations, but simply allow more options for all students.
The current housing policy that restricts students to
same-sex rooms is outdated. Many universities already
offer gender-neutral housing options, including the Uni-
versity of California, Berkeley, the University of Pennsyl-
vania, Brown University, and the University of Chicago.
As a leading progressive public university, the University
of Michigan should join these institutions in allowing
gender-neutral housing.
The creation of a gender-neutral housing option is
essential to assuring equality in the dorms for all people,
regardless of their gender, gender expression or sexual
orientation. Gender-neutral housing will benefit the
entire campus community by making the dorms more
inclusive. The University has already made improvements
to the housing policy by offering more options to trans-
gender students, but an openly-available gender-neutral
housing option could help many LGBT students feel more
comfortable in the residence halls.
By forcing men and women to live separately, the Uni-
versity promotes heteronormativity, or the discrimina-
tory mindset that heterosexuality is the norm and other
sexual orientations are less valid. The current housing
standards don't allow men and women to room together,
therefore preventing couples from living together. How-
ever, gay and lesbian couples can share the same room.
The current policy denies that men and women can live in

close quarters without having a sexual relationship.
Many students of different genders choose to live
together off-campus. They are aware that gender alone
isn't a good indicator of whether people will be able to
live together peacefully, feel at ease around each other
or address conflicts successfully. As adults, we should be
able to determine the best living situation for ourselves.
For many students, living with a friend of a different gen-
der would not only be a reasonable choice, but it would
also be the best decision for both parties. However, the
message our same-sex roommate policy sends to those
who would prefer an alternative is "pay up for a single or
get out of the dorms."
Men and women may wish to live in single-sex hall-
ways for personal or religious reasons, and the University
won't violate their rights by randomly assigning them to
a roommate of a different gender. Moreover, University
Housing will continue to offer co-ed halls without gen-
der-neutral options. Gender-neutral housing will simply
be another choice available to students who specifically
request it.
Gender-neutral housing would be beneficial to all stu-
dents regardless of their gender or sexual orientation. It
gives students the right to determine their own living
situation and thereby empowers them. Gender-neutral
housing could create a greater sense of community in
the dorms and make University Housing more appealing
to upperclassmen. The dorms should accommodate the
needs and rights of all students.
Gender-neutral housing may seem like a radical shift,
but it would not differ much from the co-ed floors Hous-
ing already offers. It is time for the University to offer a
gender-neutral housing option to all students.
To take the survey and support gender-neutral hous-
ing, please follow instructions in the e-mail sent out yes-
terday by the RHA. The results will help determine how
to best structure gender-neutral housing at the Univer-
sity.

New CFO says GM could
-end with a profit in 2010

Lidell says Brazil,
China sales could
offset European and
North America sales
DETROIT (AP) - If the econ-
omy cooperates and auto sales
recover a bit, General Motors Co.
has a reasonable chance of turn-
ing a full-year profit in 2010, its
new chief financial officer said
yesterday.
Former Microsoft Corp. CFO
Chris Liddell, at his first meet-
ing with reporters in Detroit, said
the automaker is making money
in Brazil and China, struggling
in Europe and somewhere in
between the two in North Amer-
ica.
"Relative to where we were a
couple of years ago, that's enor-
mous progress," he said in a con-
ference room at GM's downtown
Detroit headquarters.
A full-year profit for GM, which
left bankruptcy protection in July,
would be the company's first since

2004 when it made $2.7 billion. It
has posted more than $88 billion
in losses since then.
Liddell also said it's pos-
sible that GM will sell shares to
the public in the second half of
2010. But he wouldn't set a time-
table because GM must be mak-
ing money, auto sales and the
economy have to recover and the
financial markets must be recep-
tive.
GM also has tobe selling its cars
and trucks well within a recover-
ing market, he said.
"It's impossible to sit here in
March and say when all those fac-
tors are going to come together,"
Liddell said.
GM has received $52 billion in
U.S. government aid, and Liddell
said he would like to repay the
$6.7 billion loan portion of the aid
before June.
Liddell would not predict how
much of the remainder would be
repaid from the stock offering, but
said it likely would take years for
the government to divest itself of
its 61 percent share of the auto-
maker.

Liddell, 51, left his job at Micro-
soft with aspirations of becoming
a CEO. New GM CEO Ed Whitacre
Jr. said Liddell would be a candi-
date for the top job, but that was
before Whitacre took the post
himself.
Liddell said his new job is a
challenge and wouldn't say much
about whether he'd like to suc-
ceed Whitacre. He added he had
other opportunities that paid
more and would have been less
difficult, but he was attracted by
the challenge and importance of
helping to resurrect GM, which
he said affects the lives of mil-
lions of people.
"Other than that, it was an
extremely rational decision," he
joked.
He also said the automaker's
financial operations are not as bad
as characterized by Steven Rat-
tner, the former head of the gov-
ernment's auto task force.
Rattner said in an October mag-
azine article about the task force
that GM had "perhaps the weak-
est finance operation any of us had
ever seen in a major company."

TOM GREEN COUNTY JAL/AP
Colleen LaRose, the self-described "Jihad Jane" who thought her blond hair and blue eyes would let her blend in, is a rare case
of an American woman aiding foreign terrorists and shows the evolution of the global threat, authorities say.
. Cases show challenge
of do-mestic terrorists

More than a dozen
U.S. citizens sought
on terrorism charges
in the past two years
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
growing front in the war on terror-
ism may be no farther than Main
Street.
The terror cases that have
emerged in the past week have one
common characteristic: The sus-
pects are all Americans.
One is a woman who looked
after the elderly in suburban Penn-
sylvania. Another a security guard
from New Jersey.
Altogether more than a dozen
Americans have been captured or
pursued for allegedly supporting
jihad, or holy war, over the past two
years. The cases demonstrate with
increasing clarity what authorities
have long known: The terrorist
threat does not just come from the
skies, far away, but from Home-
town, U.S.A.
Some were inspired by the
U.S. involvement in the Iraq and
Afghanistan wars, federal pros-
ecutors said. Others, like the
accused Pennsylvania woman,
allegedly wanted to avenge what
they considered an insult to the
Prophet Muhammad. Many trav-
eled overseas to get terrorist
training. Some fomented plots on
their computers in the comfort of
their own homes.
There is no evidence that these
cases are connected in any way. But
they underscore the new reality
that there is a threat from violent
Islamic extremism from within the
U.S. It is difficult to say whether
the uptick in cases is because law
enforcement has gotten better at
catching suspects or if there are
simply more to catch.
FBI special agent Brett Hoving-
ton said the government needs to
do more scientific research around
the country on why Americans are
becoming radicalized and turning
toward violent extremism.
Hovington runs the FBI's com-
munity relations unit, which focus-
es on this type of outreach across
the country. Speaking to lawmak-
ers yesterday about countering
violent extremism, Hovington said
sociologists, political scientists and
psychologists can help in this area.
Most of the recent wave of cases
ended with suspects captured
before they could act on their plans.
But some of the people were just
about to execute their plans when
they were caught, like the Denver-
area airport shuttle driver, Najibul-
lah Zazi. Zazi pleaded guilty in
February as the leader of a plot to
bomb the New York subway system
in September 2009 with explosives
made frombeauty supplies.
In the case of Army Maj. Nidal
Hasan, law enforcement was too
late to prevent the attack. Hasan, a
U.S.-born Army psychiatrist of Pal-

estinian descent, is charged with
killing 13 people during a shoot-
ing rampage at the military base in
Fort Hood, Texas.
Law enforcement knew of both
Zazi's and Hasan's contact with
people with suspected terrorism-
ties before they were arrested. Zazi
was under FBI surveillance when
he was caught. And the FBI knew
about Hasan's e-mails with a radi-
cal Islamic cleric but did not think
he posed a serious threat.
Determining how quickly a sus-
pected homegrown terrorist goes
from adopting extremist rheto-
ric to becoming a suicide bomber
is a continuing challenge to law
enforcement. Some people never
make that leap. Others do it in a
matter of months or years.
"Individuals can be radicalized
in a number of ways - by direct
contact with terrorists abroad or in
the United States, over the Internet
or on their own through a process
of self-radicalization," said Assis-
tant Attorney General David Kris,
the top counterterrorism official at
the Justice Department.
These cases, Kris said, "under-
score the constantly evolving
nature of the threat we face."
For years U.S. officials have
predicted there would be a rise in
homegrown terrorism.
"Now we're beginning to see
the predictions coming true,"
said Michael Chertoff, the former
Homeland Security secretary.
Because of this, Chertoff said, it
is critical for communities to look
for unusual behavior. Law enforce-
ment, he added, needs to continue
to educate people on the differing
signs of terrorism.
There is no single reason people
drift toward terrorism.
"It's a combination of psychol-
ogy, sociology and people who,
just for cultural reasons, gravitate"
to Islamic extremism, Chertoff
said. "We can't assume we've got
months and years."
Colleen LaRose, the Pennsyl-
vania woman who allegedly met
violent jihadists online under

the name "Jihad Jane," took only
months to radicalize, prosecu-
tors say. LaRose, according to her
boyfriend, never showed religious
leanings during the five years they
dated. Then, her boyfriend came
home last summer, and she was
gone. In a June 2008 YouTube
video, the blond-haired, green-
eyed Muslim convert said she was
"desperate to do something some-
how to help" ease the suffering
of Muslims, federal prosecutors
allege.
Some homegrown terrorists
take much longer to show their
militant leanings. In the case of
North Carolina drywall contrac-
tor Daniel Boyd, federal prosecu-
tors say he nursed his ambitions for
jihad over decades. Boyd is accused
of leading a group of men - includ-
ing two of his sons - who planned
to kidnap, kill and maim people
in other countries in the name of
jihad.
One of Boyd's neighbors said he
didn't think Boyd was a terrorist.
"If he's a terrorist, he's the nic-
est terrorist I ever met in my life,"
Charles Casale said.
Boyd decried the U.S. military,
praised the honor in martyrdom,
bemoaned the struggle of Mus-
lims and said "I love jihad" on
audiotapes obtained by federal
authorities.
It is not a new concept for
Americans to join the jihadi cause.
In 2001, John Walker Lindh was
arrested in Afghanistan for fight-
ing as part of the Taliban. Raised
Catholic, the California native was
12 when he saw the movie "Mal-
colm X" and became interested in
Islam. A few years later, the teen-
ager converted to Islam.
In 2008, intelligence officials
predicted there would be more
homegrown terrorists over the
next few years and their attack
methods would become more
sophisticated. Officials continue
to be concerned with the Inter-
net as a means to spread rationale,
inspiration and training for the
Islamic extremist agenda.

No deal to stop, congressional
resolution on alleged genocide
As resolution nears
passage, T .Crkeypulls
Washington, D.C.

WASHINGTON (AP) - A con-
gressional resolution that would
recognize World War I-era kill-
ings of Armenians by Ottoman
Turks as genocide could go for-
ward despite opposition from the
Obama administration.
Assistant Secretary of State
Philip Gordon told reporters there
is no deal with Democratic con-
gressional leaders to block the res-
olution. That contradicts earlier
claims by the State Department.
"Congress is an independent
body, and they are going to do what
they decide to do," Gordon said
ahead of speech at the Brookings
Institution.
Turkey strongly opposes the
resolution. It withdrew its ambas-
sador to Washington earlier this
month after a congressional com-
mittee approved the measure.
Gordon acknowledged the con-
gressional committee vote had set
back relations at a time when the
United States is seeking help from
Turkey to rein in Iran's nuclear
ambitions. But he said the United
States has not seen a deterioration
in cooperation with Turkey on a
wide range of foreign policy mat-
ters.
The Obama administration has
urged lawmakers to keep the mea-

mWnaI'

Members of Workers' Party marched in Istanbul last week, after Sweden's parliament
approved a resolution calling the 1915 mass killing of Armenians in Turkey a genocide.

sure from a vote in the full House.
It is not clear whether supporters
of the resolution have enough sup-
port to bring it to the House floor.
"I recognize that we have a
tough job ahead of us to garner the
necessary support," said the reso-
lution's chief sponsor, California
Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff.
Gordon said the resolution is an
obstacle for reconciliation talks
between Turkey and Armenia.
The two countries reached a deal
last year to normalize relations
and open their border, but it has
not yet been ratified by their gov-
ernments.
But Gordon denied the process
had stalled.

"I really think that those two
countries' leaderships are commit-
ted to doing this," he told reporters.
He said that the Obama admin-
istration thinks the historical
issues are best addressed by the
two countries as part of reconcili-
ation talks.
Historians estimate that up
to 1.5 million Armenians were
killed by Ottoman Turks around
the time of World WarI, an event
widely viewed by scholars as the
first genocide of the 20th cen-
tury. Turkey, however, denies the
deaths constituted genocide, say-
ing the toll has been inflated and
that those killed were victims of
civil war and unrest.

WASHINGTON (AP) - An

Kelly added that recently the
number of private student loans
has been steadily increasing,
while federal student loans have
been falling.
Lisa Westermann, a spokes-
woman for Wells Fargo, wrote in
an e-mail statement that regard-
less of the proposed legislation,
Wells Fargo would continue to
support students in any way that
they can.
"We remain committed to serv-
ing the financial needs of students
and families through responsible
lending of student loan prod-
ucts and to our team members
who serve these customers," she
wrote.

Armstrong added that offering
students the option of Saturday
night dining is important because
for many students Saturday night
is a "large drinking night," and a
lack of an option for dinner could
be "dangerous" for those who can-
not afford to eat in Ann Arbor res-

empty stomach.
Armstrong, who also serves as
chair of MSA's LGBT Commission,
said if elected, he will build a better

Saturday night dining option in the

way to target al-Qaida and Tal-
iban leaders hiding in the rugged
mountainous border. While Paki-
stani officials have criticized the
strikes, it is widely believed that
Islamabad privately supports the
attacks and works with the U.S. to
provide intelligence.
CIA director Leon Panetta
said the stepped-up campaign
has driven Osama bin Laden and
other leaders deeper into hiding
and left al-Qaida and the Taliban
in Pakistan's tribal regions in dis-
array.
"Those operations are seriously
disrupting al-Qaida," Panetta told
The Washington Post in an inter-
view. "It's pretty clear from all the
intelligence we are getting that
they are having a very difficult
time putting together any kind of
command and control, that they
are scrambling. And that we really
do have them on the run."
Al-Yemeni is considered an
important al-Qaida planner and
explosives expert who had estab-

lished contact with groups rang-
ing from al-Qaida in the Arabian
Peninsula to Afghan and Paki-
stani Taliban militant groups. He
is also known as Ghazwan al-
Yemeni.
The counterterrorism official
said al-Yemeni was in his late 20s
or early 30s and was a conduit in
Pakistan for funds, messages, and
recruiting but that he specialized
in suicide operations.
A jihadist Web site linked to
al-Qaida recently announced his
death, said Bruce Riedel, a former
CIA officer who now is a senior
fellow at the Brookings Institu-
tion's Saban Center.
"This is another sign that drone
operations and stepped-up efforts
against al-Qaida are having an
impact in the tribal regions,"
Riedel said yesterday. He said
al-Yemeni served prison time
in Yemen in 2005 before being
released and has since moved
through Afghanistan and Iran
and was a trainer for the Taliban.

HLC

theHLC committeefeltthe Univer-
sity should focus additional atten-
tion to one area within the first
criterion, which calls for the Uni-
versity to operate "with integrity to
ensure the fulfillment of its mission
through structures and processes
that involve the board, administra-
tion, faculty, staff and students."
Without going into extensive
detail during the meeting, Fernan-
dez said the University should
ensure this pledge is held and con-
tinues to be upheld by taking a look
at its commitment to diversity.
However, Fernindez reported
the concern was minor enough that
the HLC delegation would not pro-
pose outside intervention, instead
telling University officials they
should look into the matter.
At the meeting, University Presi-
dent Mary Sue Coleman said she
was happy with the process and
was appreciative of the hard work
both members of the HLC delega-
tion and officials at the University
had put into the process.
In an interview following the
meeting, Coleman declined to com-

GRAFFITI
From Page 1A
to pay to remove any graffiti on
their buildings.
The ordinance was implement-
ed after City Council received
complaints from people who
believed many property owners
did not care enough to remove
graffiti when it appeared on their
buildings.
City Councilmember Chris
Taylor (D -Ward 3), one of the
sponsors of the initial proposal
for the graffiti ordinance, said
that while City Council hasn't
analyzed official numbers, he
believes the ordinance is doing
its job.
"Where I used to see graffiti,
I'm not seeing it anymore," Tay-
lor said.
According to Taylor, City
Council is waiting to review the
ordinance until a report is fin-
ished in upcoming months.
Though graffiti is sprawled on
sides of property in Graffiti Alley,
the area remains unaffected by
the ordinance simply because

cuss the matter since the University
had notyet receivedthe delegation's
report. However, Coleman said she.
appreciated the delegation's input
and advice, adding that the com-
mittee was trying to help the Uni-
versity advance its work.
HLC delegates will now return
to their respective universities and
will work on drafting the commit-
tee's report to the HLC. The com-
mittee has four to six weeks to draft
the report, but Fernindez said in an
interview Monday that he expects
the report tobe compiled earlier.
Once the reportis written, a draft
will be sentto University officials to
review for factual accuracy over a
two-week period. In the interview,
Fernindez stressed that University
officials would only be allowed to
offer factual corrections - like if a
name or date was mixed up.
After the committee reviews the
draft with suggested corrections, it
will finalize its report and will sub-
mitittothe HLC Board of Trustees
who will make the official decision
about whether or not to reaccredit
the University.
It is possible that if the University
does not agree with the assessment
offered by the HLC delegation in its
report, it could appeal the findings.
However, Coleman did not make
people have chosen not to file
complaints, according to City
Councilmember Sandi Smith (D-
Ward 1). The ordinance is geared
toward new graffiti that appears
on the sides of clean buildings.
"There is a gray area in the
ordinance, which is for art on
the side of a building," Smith
said. "It seems to me that every-
body looks at Graffiti Alley
as something they don't want
whitewashed."
Smith cited the mural on the
side of Potbelly's at the corner of
South State Street and East Lib-
erty Street as another example of
art on a building. Even if some-
one were to complain about the
mural, the city would likely not
require its removal.
Smith said that she was not a
big proponent of the ordinance
when it was passed, though
she has yet to notice any major
changes to the frequency of graf-
fiti as a result of it.
"I don't know that we see any
more or less (graffiti) than we did
before," Smith said. "In terms of
what deems it a success, I guess
that's in the eye of the beholder."

any indication yesterday that she
planned to do so based on what she
knows about the HLC's findings at
this point.
TheUniversityundergoes areac-
creditation review every 10 years.
During the last review in 2000, the
HLC did not raise concerns about
diversity in its report.
"With strong leadership from
the president, provost and execu-
tive officer, the University of
Michigan is a national leader in its
passionate commitment to diversity
and affirmative action," the 2000
reaccreditation delegation from the
HLC wrote in its report.
It is not yet known what the HLC
delegation will include in it's report
to the HLC Board of Trustee's and
what statement, if any, willbe includ-
ed abouttheir commentson diversity.
The HLC delegation arrived on
campus Sunday to start a two-day
series of interviews that ran on
Monday and Tuesday before leav-
ing after yesterday morning's exec-
utive briefing.
However, HLC representatives
have been working on review-
ing University documentation for
quite some time prior to their visit.
University officials have been pre-
paring the documentation and
coordinating the site visit for the
past three years.
When The Michigan Daily
checked the progress of the
graffiti ordinance in July 2009,
the system for reporting graffiti
was complaint-based, meaning a
resident had to file a complaint
with the city in order for the city
to issue notices to property own-
ers.
According to Taylor, the same
method is still used for the ordi-
nance.
Department of Public Safety
spokeswoman Diane Brown said
it's difficult to measure the fre-
quency of graffiti on campus.
Just like the city's complaint sys-
tem, not all cases of graffiti are
reported to DPS.
Brown also said the University
allows a certain level of artis-
tic expression. University policy
permits temporary graffiti, like
chalk, on horizontal surfaces.
Anything written with a perma-
nent material, like paint, or on
a vertical surface is considered
destruction of property.
"We want to embrace free-
dom of expression but not to the
point of destruction of property,"
Brown said.


business, saying that private loan
and bank programs will still be
allowed to operate. He added that
the loss of jobs won't be too sig-
nificant, because the student aid
industry isn't very "labor inten-
sive."
"The direct student loan pro-
gram still relies on private con-
tractors, banks to service loans
and to do some of the adminis-
tration of loans," Bishop said. "So
there's going to be work under
this program, in fact there contin-
ues to be work under this direct
student loan program."
Bishop said the student aid plan
requires the balancing of resourc-
es and making sure that the bill
will be beneficial to both students
and employees who work in the
student loan industry.
"There's no question in terms of
the benefit to students, benefit to
families. And because of the fact
that there will still be a role for
private servicers in the system,
we think we've struck the right
balance with the SAFRA law."
Pamela Fowler, executive direc-
tor for the University's Office of
Financial Aid, wrote in an e-mail
interview that, for the 2008-2009
academic year, 1,833 undergradu-
ates used private lenders for their
loan needs.
Students are eligible for two
types of student loans, either sub-
sidized or unsubsidized, with the

latter not based on need.
Fowler added that for the 2008-
2009 year, 7,512 undergradu-
ate students received subsidized
loans, while 8,160 undergraduate
students received unsubsidized
loans.
Fowler noted that there is
duplication between the num-
bers, as some students receive
both subsidized and unsubsidized
loans.
Williams of the U.S. Public
Interest Research Group said he
believes the proposed legislation
is important because students like
those at the University who tak-
ing out loans are incurring debt
that has increased dramatically
over time.
"Just twelve years ago, only
one-third of students needed to
borrow to go to college, and their
average debt was $12,000," he
said. "In 2008, two-thirds of col-
lege students are borrowing to
graduate and their average debt is
closer to $25,000."
Kantrowitz of Finaid.org said
he thinks the proposed legislation
could benefit parties other than
students taking out the loans.
"The argument is that you get
all of the savings," Kantrowitz
said. "You can use the savings
for a combination of student aid,
other priorities and deficit reduc-
tion, and you don't have to raise
taxes to increase student aid."


brand themselves," he said.
The goal of the courses is to help
participants find the right career
by gainaing a better understanding
of their strengths.
"We're the bridge between the
former career and the new career,"
he said.
Once the participants choose a
career, LEARN will help them find
the right school for their occupa-
tion and teach them how to fund
that education, Fama said.
Wooten said she chooses the
courses for the program based
on research about the sectors in
which opportunities for employ-
ment are growing.
According to the Department
of Energy, Labor and Economic
Growth, from October 2007 to
October 2009, jobs in the private
health care and social assistance
sectors grew 2.4 percent. Dura-
ble goods manufacturing jobs
declined 26.4 percent in that same

time period.
Because health care has sur-
passed manufacturing as the
leading industry in Michigan, the
program wanted to offer those
courses first, in order to give its
participants the "greatest benefit,"
Fama said.
Courses to come later this
year include classes on emerging
technologies and governmental
non-profit jobs, as well as some
intermediate computer skills
training.
Wooten said she is excited to
offer the computer-based courses
because they can help unemployed
workers create a resume.
Thus far, there has been a large
amount of interest in the program
due to its advertisements on the
Fox 2 news channel, according to
Fama.
"In one week we've seen a huge
jump in our website traffic," he
said. "It really is unbelievable."

and current Rackham Rep. Michael
Benson said at the time that MSA
would push RHA to offer the option,
accordingto the Daily article.
"It's an issue that affects all of
our constituents," he said at the
time. "So now we'll work collabora-
tively, as we have in the past, with
RHA to try and find some sort of a
solution."
Caitlin Sadler, president of the
Residential Hall Association, said in
an interview this week thatthe issue
of Saturday nightdiningcould be via-
ble with sufficient student interest.
"If the students currently in the
residence halls are very interested...
it's definitely something that could
be solved," Sadler said.
University Housing spokes-
man Peter Logan echoed Sadler's
sentiments, saying that Saturday
night dining was cancelled in 2005
because of the low student turnout
in the dining halls. A dinner option
for Sunday - which hadn't been
available since 1965 - was revived
instead.
"It was determined that the stu-
dent interest at that time was more
geared toward a Sunday evening
meal," Logan said. "Saturday eve-
ning dining did not have significant
participation in it because, as you
can imagine, many students have
differentplans on Saturday night."

Logan added that maintaining
both Saturday and Sunday din-
ner options would cost Univer-
sity dining facilities an additional
$300,000.
"When we make a significant
change in operations that has an
increase in expense, we have to fig-
ure out a way to offset that expense
so that we aren't making it an addi-
tionalburdenontheresidential stu-
dent," he said.
"I doubt very much, personally,
that students at this point would
want to undertake an additional
meal that would add sufficiently to
their board expenses," Logan said.
East Quad resident and LSA
senior Elizabeth Jackson said Sat-
urday night dining would be con-
venient, especially during the cold
winter months.
"During winter, I don't want to
leave the dorm, and I don't want to
pay for delivery," she said.
Engineering sophomore Wil-
liam Mohr, said he doesn't mind
the lack of a dinner option on Satur-
day nights because it gives him an
excuse to eat out with friends over
the weekend.
"It's a nice break from cafeteria
food," Mohr said.

Lebler playing best hockey
as M' career winds down

By MICHAEL FLOREK
Daily Sports Writer
When Brian Lebler came to Ann
Arbor, most of the time he was
gasping for air.
"He was a lumbering skater.
He would just kind of lumber up
and down the ice. He had limited
endurance. When we would do our
down-and-backs, he would just
die. SoI was all over him about his
conditioning, about his weight."
For the senior, two words are
more important than the rest of
Michigan coach Red Berenson's
take on his early time with the
Michigan hockey team - "was"
and "would."
Despite his past shortcom-
ings, with his Michigan career
dwindling Lebler has elevated his
game and, according to Berenson
is, "playing the best hockey of his
career right now," and it's hard to
argue against it. The Penticton,
British Columbia native has set
career highs in goals (12) assists
(9) and points (21) this season and
proved to be more of a factor than
the stats have shown.
In Michigan's series-clinching
win over Michigan State last Sat-
urday, the game-winning goal
came from Lebler's linemate,
freshman Chris Brown. But it was
Lebler who hit a Spartan defense-
man in the corner to free up the
puck. Lebler then rolled to the net
to get a whack at the puck, right
before Brown found it and put it
in.

"He's a physical force out there
and that might have led to Brown's
winning goal," Berenson said. "It's
not a pretty goal but it looks pretty
goal on paper."
The late game effort was miss-
ing in Lebler's previous seasons,
as his conditioning and skating
wasn't where it needed to be. He
played in just 29 of the team's 41
games as a sophomore, registering
just eight points. 1
But last season, he took a small
step forward, scoring 16 points
and establishing himself as a
power forward for the Wolverines.
"Last year I thought we a saw
big difference in his condition-
ing and his skating and he looked
lighter on his feet and he was play-
ing lighter," Berenson said. "Then,
he got working on his shot ... then
he got working on his work ethic
.... When all those things start
coming together you start getting
some results."
Lebler's physicality and his
6-foot-3, 212 pound frame have
found him a niche at power for-
ward on the third line, playing
along with Brown and freshman
A.J. Treais.
The three have been playing
together since the start of the
postseason and have notched two
goals in four games.
As the only veteran presence on
the line, Lebler has been forced
into a leadership role.
"I feel like I have to be a leader
everywhere," Lebler said. "But
those two guys are mature hock-

ber of familiar faces in the next

to Michigan's advantage, helping
them alongthe road to becoming
a basketball powerhouse.
And Friday's first-round NIT
matchup against Kent State (20-
10 overall, 12-4 MAC) is just the
beginning.
"I'm just thrilled,
excited, anxious," fresh-
man guard Jenny Ryan
said. "I have no idea what
to expect. We're just so
excited because it's a new
thing for a lot of us. Half
the team has never seen
postseason play before, so
it's crazy."
As he has done on two
occasions in past coaching

the program around. He

years as head coach before

and with three graduating seniors
and only one junior, the program
will be almost entirely picked by
the veteran postseason tourna-
ment coach next year.
While Borseth didn't have
much of a choice in starting two
freshmen this season after six
seniors graduated lastyear - four
of whom started - not only has
it proved a success, but the expe-
rience freshman gaurds Ryan
and Dayeesha Hollins will have

they needed for a Tourney bid.
There is no question that before
the talented freshman class ledby
Ryan and Hollins complete their
careers at Michigan, the team, like
the others Borseth has taken to
new heights, will no longer be one
of anonymity.
"I think that anybody around
basketball that understands rec-
ognizes what we're going through
in trying to build our program,"
Borseth said on Big Ten Media
Day before the season. "I think
they can see that. It's going to
work. It's worked every other
place, and it's going to work here.
It's just the amount of time it's

T here's an organization on campus that
limited experience and turns them
into a team of champions. The Uni-
versity's admissions process is brutal, its athletic
teams recruit vigorously and its artists are tal-
ented, but most have been honing their craft for
years. It's only the University of Michigan Ball-
room Dance Team that turns complete novices
into world-class competitors.
On a Saturday afternoon in the CCRB, you're
likely to stumble across the usual sights and
sounds: people running on treadmills, lifting
weights, sweating it out and feeling the burn
on various complicated exercise contraptions.
In the CCRB's mirror room, however, you'll
find something unique, something that initial-
ly resembles an awkward middle school dance
but upon further observation is clearly much
more.
It's here that the Michigan Ballroom Dance
Team hosts its weekly newcomer lessons. The
room is lined with people shedding their win-
ter boots for dance shoes, while a few brave
couples casually dance to the loud music blar-
ing through the studio. Some watch their arms
or hips in the large mirror, repeating a move
over and over until they're satisfied with how
it looks, while others are simply killing time
before class begins.
An older couple dressed in all black takes the
center of the room and begins class. The room
is almost instantly divided by gender as about
30 women line one side, and 30 men take the
other. The coaches start on the Rumba, slowly
breaking it down, explaining and demonstrat-
ing the quick Latin dance.
Each dancer watches intently, moving his
or her feet along with the instructors', trying
to match each step. That reminiscence of pre-

pubescent dances completely dissipates as the
British man in the center yells, "Men, grab a
woman!" The crowd follows his commands -
"quick, quick, slow, slow" - and the room of 60
men and women becomes a room of 30 couples
moving in unison, surprisingly seamless for a
beginner class.-
In this class, the team was working en
Rumba and Foxtrot, but there are many more
dances the teammembers mustlearn. Ballroom
competitions are divided into two categories,
Latin and Standard, and each category consists
of five dances. Rumba, Jive, Paso Doble, Samba
and Cha Cha make up the Latin dances while
Standard consists of Waltz, Foxtrot, Quick-
step, Tango and Viennese Waltz. Not only do
the dancers have to be proficient in each and
every one of these dances, they have to be able
to perform them unchoreographed, on the fly.
Though most team members have never
partner-danced before joining the team, the
Michigan Ballroom Team is one of the best in
the country, having won seven national cham-
pionships - the International Team Match in
2001, 2002, 2007 and 2008; and the American
Team Match in 2001, 2003 and 2004.
Many of the members, like Engineering
freshman Ryan Pollard, had never danced
before joining and got involved on a whim.
"I had four other friends who decided to join
at the same time, so that was pretty much all
(the persuasion) I needed," Pollard said.
Business junior Daniel Lian joined in a simi-
lar fashion. He and his partner, LSA junior Sofia
Yokosawa, have been dancingtogether for almost
three years now. They found each other using the
dance team's partner search, an event the team
hosts to help newcomers find someone they're
compatible with for ballroom competitions.

that action must be taken, but they also kind of want to go on vacation,

Corralling creativity
will oniy stigmatize

A festival of student plays

There are a lot of delicious foods
out there in the world, and
myself enjoy a tasty treat every
once in a while. Sometimes, I'll even com-
bine two of these deli-
cious items together
to make an even more
delicious entity. But
even someone with as
little cooking experi-
ence as I have knows
that you can't just
throw a bunch of ran- JAME
dom-yet-tasty ingre- BLOCK
dients into a pot and
expect a good result.
I fear that in creating the new living-
learning community Living Arts on
North Campus, the University and the
Arts on Earth Program have made this
same oulinary error. All the individual
parts are worthwhile, but the idea as a
whole might not be constructive.
Inspired by a University class on the
creative process and slated to initiate
next fall, the goal behind the com-
munity is to encourage the sharing of
creative ideas across disciplines and to
get students more involved in the arts
on campus. Beyond that, not much has
been specifically laid out. The plan is to
let much of the programming arise natu-
rally from the students' creativity.
On a checklist, this seems like an awe-
some new option. Being in a think tank
with my fellow creative minds? Seems
awesome. Getting inside access with
performers and lecturers who come from
across the nation and the world? Seems
yet more awesome. Living next to people
with whom I may actually have some-
thing in common? Seems awesome for
me, but maybe not so awesome overall.
In essence, Living Arts is a Residential
College on North Campus, and it's likely
to develop a similar reputation. Now, I'm
a member of the RC, I love the RC and
I would recommend the RC to anyone.
But there's one problem with the RC that
I'm afraid will rear its ugly head again in
Living Arts. If we put all the people with
pink mohawks, a bajillion piercings and
off-the-wall artistic projects in one place,
there will be some level of alienation.
I'm certainly not blind to the stigma
that all RC students are crazy progres-
sive liberals with weird hair and hobbies.
Many of us here in the RC make the same
comments, but in a more loving tone. I
worry, though, that Living Arts will be a
second beacon of alienation. It is a place
that the artistically reluctant could see
as a corral, keeping those weirdos con-
tained in a single area, a safe distance
from the rest of the students.
When a certain group of people is
deemed the "artistic group," outsiders
are even less likely to get involved. It's
like when the girl you had a crush on in

middle school would dance in a circle
with her friends. You're far less likely to
talk to her if you have to break into an
established group. Trust me, I was a shy
little kid. It's intimidating.
Instead of implementing the Living
Arts plan into a specific community,
why not just have similar programs that
are universally available? If we want a
creative think tank, we don't need to
take the "tank" part literally by making
everyone live together. The nobler effort
would be to create some special program
or campus group that made a conscious
effort to recruit artistic thinkers not only
across the disciplines, but also across
campus. Not only does this provide a
more diverse perspective, but it allows
the students to share the ideas they learn
from other program members with the
people around them. In Living Arts, you
wouldn't be able to share these ideas
with your community because your ideas
came from within that community.
Take the Living out
of Living Arts.
And there's really nothing Living
Arts wants to do that can't be done on
this broader scale. If the people behind
the program think there ought to be a
chance to have some casual conversation
time with the speakers and performers
the 'U' brings in, they should certainly
arrange this. But why not make it avail-
able to everyone? To be honest, there
aren't enough people who would have
the interest and free time to attend every
event, so overcrowding should hardly
be a worry. Besides, nobody reads flyers
or campus-wide event e-mails, so most
people won't even know the opportunity
exists. This way it's still a self-selecting
program, but without the corral.
Basically, Living Arts is taking the
wrong approach to the right ideas. Per-
haps the culinary comparison could use
some revision. If I want to make a deli-
cious smoothie (and why wouldn't I?) I
will get some delicious fruits and throw
them in the blender. Living Arts aims to
make itself a smoothie too (I mean, who

Student playwrights'
work performed in its
rawest form.
By EMMA JESZKE
Daily TV/New Media Editor
This weekend, Ann Arbor has an oppor-
tunity to see theater in its rawest, purest
form. Playfest, a fes-
tival that features Playfest
staged theatrical
readings of student- Thursday through
written plays, offers Saturday at 7 p.m.
a new twist on the Studio One
traditional produc- Free
tions put on at Studio
One. With no sets or costumes, and actors
with scripts in hand, audiences can get an
inside lookat student playwrights as their
work is presented in public for the very
first time.
The process behind this year's Play-
fest started last fall with the course The-
atre 327: Intermediate Playwriting, when
Department of Theatre & Drama Prof.
OyamO selected six student playwrights
whose work seemed ready to be pushed
a little further. Consequently, these writ-
ers enrolled in Theatre 429: Playwriting
Towards Production, a course designed
to help them understand their work as an
object to be produced, culminating in pro-
ductions during the week-long Playfest.
"In a sense, (the course) is kind of like
a whisper of a professional developmental
situation," OyamO said. "The object is to
have (students) develop the play as far as
they can."
"The thing isn't to make people write
in a particular, rigid form," OyamO
explained. "This is art, there is no such
thing as (a right way) in my opinion. But
the idea is to somehow or another get them
to recognize what they are doing and why
they are doing it. And to remind them to
write from their heart and intuition as
opposed to some particular notion of how
a play is supposed to be.
"I mean, Edward Albee does not write
like Shakespeare," he added.
After students enrolled in the course
discussed their work in class, each play
was assigned a student director to draw
up theoretical scenic designs and, of
course, cast the plays. In Theatre 429 stu-
dents with all different areas of theatri-
cal expertise are given the opportunity to
work together on something original and
virtually independent from the authority
of a professor.
"Playfest is representing the collabora-
tion process," said Emilie Samuelson, a
School of Music, Theatre & Dance junior
and one of the Playfest writers. "And that's
what theater is about - collaboration. To
take what we've learned and to try it out on
our own, to apply it to something, is really
important."
Audiences attending Playfest will have

Playfest gives student playwrights the opportunity to get peer feedback on their work.

a chance to participate in the collaboration
process too. The director of each play will
lead a talk-back session with the audience,
during which audience members can ask
the playwright questions or offer general
comments. The playwright will then ask
the audience questions, aiming to gain
feedback on the production and gauge the
overall response.
"It's hard to imagine how something
is going to be received," Samuelson said.
"You can justify it in your head all you
want, but whether or not the audience is
going to get it, you never know."
OyamO believes the talk-back session
with the audience is crucial to the profes-
sional developmental aspect of Playfest.
"When we get that audience feedback,
it becomes a very educational situation
where you are learning by doing," he said.
"Some kids get very excited and some may
be a little scared, but you have to get over
that.
"There is no such thing as failure if you
learned something," he added.
Playfest gives students who may not
necessarily be writing concentrators a
one-of-a-kind opportunity to have their
voices heard and to participate in keeping
the contemporary theater fresh..
"Going out into the real world, the
chance of getting a staged reading for an
inexperienced playwright is slim to none,"
Samuelson said.
"With the way the theater is right now,
it seems like there are so many revivals,"
said Matt Bouse, School of Music, Theatre
& Dance junior and Playfest writer. "So
it encourages students to write and then
rewrite. New work is cool and important,
and it helps to keep the theater alive. And
(Playfest) is good for us as playwrights, to
give us some encouragement and ... to see
what people appreciate about (our plays)."
Student-driven productions at the Uni-
versity in the past, including those at Play-
fest, have reached past the scope of the 'U'
and opened a lot of doors for the students
involved.
In 2008, former School of Music, The-
atre & Dance student Seth Moore's "Jone-

sin' was first heard at Playfest. It caught
the attention of Malcolm Tulip, clinical
assistantprofessor ofctheatre & drama who
produced the show as a mainstage Uni-
versity production in winter 2009. This
summer, Moore will be at the O'Neill's
National Playwrights Conference with
"The Man with America Skin," a piece that
premiered in 2009 at Playfest. "A Very Pot-
ter Musical," a completely student-driven
'production with Basement Arts that pre-
miered last winter, has a fan following all
over the country and has become a You-
Tube phenomenon.
"You may be looking at some talent
that's going to be up on a board some-
day, and you can say you saw them first,"
OyamO said.
The ideas students are exploring in
their work featured in this year's Playfest
rest on all sides of the spectrum - ranging
from an absurdist black comedy that starts
with the unexpected arrival of a pizza man
and ends with mayhem and murder, to an
abstract, poetic and idealistic piece about
failing to escape from a destructive life
cycle.
"I can never be certain what these kids
are going to write," OyamO said. "A lot of
the time people say 'Write whatyou know,'
but it's all experimental, so you can pretty
much go wherever you want - there are no
restrictions. Except porn, none of that; I'd
say try cable for that."
Although the opportunity has passed
to see "Living Dead" by Bouse (Monday),
"Pictures of You" by Samuelson (Tuesday)
and "The Tyler Family Portrait" by School
of Music, Theatre & Dance freshman Alli-
son Brown (Wednesday), there are still
three more plays. "Boundary Trauma" by
School of Music, Theatre & Dance junior
Allison Stock premieres tonight, "Caged"
by LSA junior Alison Rieth premieres
Friday, and "Elbow Room" by School of
Music, Theatre & Dance senior Tedra Mil-
lan will close Playfest on Saturday.
"It's interesting to see what young
people are writing," OyamO said. "What
do they think about the world and what's
happening? To me, that's worth seeing."

'No notation necessary for the
daring Creative Arts Orchestra

By JOSHUA BAYER
DailyArts Writer
Not many musical directors would con-
fess, with an impish grin, that their perfor-
mances are just as likely to
"crash and burn" as they rea'e
are to be "completely thrill- A
ing and awe-inspiring."
Meet University lecturer OChestra
Mark Kirschenmann: jazz
trumpeter, solo electronic Tonight at
musician and director of the 8 p.m.
Creative Arts Orchestra, the Rackham
University's fully improvi- Auditorium
sational, genre-shredding
music ensemble.
"There's kind of a stigma sometimes that the
composer hands down this tablet that's etched,
and here it is," Kirschenmann said. "And you
are the player, therefore you will play it exact-
ly the way I've written it for you. So you are,
therefore, then the re-creator."
One of CAD's missions is to shatter this ste-
reotype of musical composition - especially in
the realm of classical music - as a fixed, air-
tight entity. In fact, CAO scarcely even looks at
musical notation at all.
"For the most part, we just set up and play.
We'll just set up in a circle, all 15 of us, and
we'll just start from nothing," Kirschenmann
said. "We won't be reading any music, we
won't be taking any cues. I'm not going to be
up there conducting. I'll be sitting, playing in
the ensemble. And it will just be continuously
unfolding."
Given CAO's unadulteratedly off-the-cuff
nature, it makes sense that its free-the-music
agenda is just as much a recipe for disaster as it
is for experimental genius. But this is precisely
what makes CAO so precious.
The concept of a fully improvisational
orchestra comes packaged with such a hefty
risk quotient that, according to Kirschen-
mann, "There are almost - in the university
system of the world - no ensembles like this."
When 'U' professor and accomplished jazz

musician Edward Sarath founded CAO 20
years ago, the vast majority of those in the
School of Music - students and professors
alike - thought that the idea was, quite simply,
a bit bananas.
According to Kirschenmann, who jumped
on board CAO in 2002, the fledgling ensemble
was met with "real skepticism and, in fact,
opposition." Even jazz musicians, the quintes-
sential proprietors of the improvisation game,
found the whole escapade to be a tad batty.
But, thankfully, CAO has weathered the
storm of practicality and will be unleashing its
renegade brand of music-making at Rackham
Auditorium tonight at 8 p.m. This brings up a
question: Exactly what should one be expect-
ing from this show?
Will Marriott, a tenor saxophonist in CAO
and sophomore in the School of Music, The-
atre & Dance, put itbluntly: "Don't expect any-
thing. Nothing canbe expected. Just go (to the
show) with an open mind and open ears and
experience music."
Taking an improv-
based approach to
classical music.
And, as frustratingly abstract as his dis-
claimer is, Marriott is right on the money.
More than anything else, CAO is out to shatter
boundaries and confound expectations. As far
as any sort of setlist, Kirschenmann asserted:
"We won't decide, probably, until two minutes
before we walk out."
An integral part of this anything-goes men-
tality is CAO's insistence on uniting musi-
cians with incredibly diverse backgrounds and
tastes - the ensemble isn't even restricted to
students in the School of Music.
"Students tend to get categorized and strati-
fied by their majors. We want to dissolve all

that," Kirschenmann said. "Why can'tclassical
players, jazz players, composers (and) music
tech people all get together and make music?
And improvise. And share their common expe-
riences, put them all into this bigpool and let it
brew and simmer.
If anything can be expected, it's a lack of
stuffiness. CAO's performances are a far cry
from any sort of classical jazz standard. The
ensemble often incorporates electronic ele-
ments, unafraid to warp traditional tones with
laptops and effects pedals.
And Gabriel Saltman, a baritone saxophon-
ist in CAO and sophomore in the School of
Music, Theatre & Dance, commented that the
jamboree isn't even limited to musical instru-
ments, stating that it's fair game "to yell, or
speak words."
Saltman actually composed a piece for CAO,
titled "Faces," which will likely debut tonight,
despite the ensemble's aversion to written
music. The catch? The piece contains absolute-
ly zero standard musical notation.
On paper, "Faces" is an expressionistic
accumulation of various shapes and colors,
from which musicians are expected to extract
emotion from and, in turn, convert into sound.
Thus, while the piece is indeed written, its
abstract nature guarantees that it sounds
drastically different each time it's played - an
aspect accentuated by the fact that Saltman
will be conducting the piece in real time, mix-
ing and matching sets of musicians on the spot.
Marriott also composed an unorthodox
piece likely to debut tonight, a kind of musical
equivalent to a "Choose Your Own Adventure"
book. The piece consists of divergent pathways
gradually layering on top of each other as the
musicians spontaneously riff on the central
melody and choose from a variety of open-
ended "routes."
Clearly, tonight's performance is going to be
an unpredictable one. And whether it's a tri-
umph or a "crash-and-burn," it certainly won't
be bland. So leave your expectations at the
door and brace yourself for something truly
unclassifiable.

BALLROOM
From Page 1B

"It's kind of like speed dat-
ing, but it's speed dancing," Lian
explained. "Everybody who
needs a partner gets in the same
room and you kind of go through
everybody, talk with them for
about a minute just to see if you
can match up your interests in
terms of, like, how much you want
to practice, and commitment lev-
els and that sort of thing, and
then you can dance with them for
a little while."
Though most people join with-
out any serious convictions,
they're often captivated by how
much fun ballroom is and quickly
find themselves competing against
- and often beating - the danc-
ers who impressed them as new-
comers. Ballroom Dance Team
President and recent 'U' alum Alex
Rowan is one of the best dancers
on the team, but he has only been
dancing for two and a half years.
He joined in his junior year upon
transferring to the University.
"Someone invited me to the
Welcome Week lessons that are
hosted every fall to recruit new
members and they kind ofspark
an interest," Rowan said. "I didn't
know what ballroom dancing
was. You know, you'd heard of the
dances like the waltz ... but you've
never, like, physically done them."
Rowan is now president of one
of the best collegiate ballroom
dance teams in the country and
consistently takes first place at
national competitions.
The sport of
ballroom dance
It's Feb. 13, the night of the 10th
Annual University of Michigan
Ballroom Dance Competition, and
the bleachers at the Saline Middle
School gymnasium are full of spec-
tators and fans of ballroom. Color-
ful gowns trail serenely behind
the couples as they not only move
to the music but become a part of
it. The dancers' body language
expresses their obvious joy to be on
the floor, making the scene all the
more exquisite. The sheer beauty
of their movement makes it easy to
forget this isn't just a performance
for an audience to admire - that
the romantic and elegant imagery
is only a small part of the evening.
The competition is akin to a
large sporting event, but instead
of two large basketball players tip-
ping off to begin the game, Tchai-
kovsky's "Waltz of the Flowers"
fills the gym and eight couples
begin gracefully twirling and
floating across the dance floor. The
basketball court is dramatically lit
with large spotlights, and mem-
bers of the crowd cheer and yell
out the numbers of their favorite
competitors. The competitive air
clashing with the grace of dancing
creates a surreal experience where
the lines separating art and sports
are blurred.
"My original interest in ball-
room was because it was analo-
gous to a sport ... I was an athlete
and I saw it was a way of train-
ing your body, staying in shape,"
Rowan said. "But at its very roots
and when you really learn a deeper
side of ballroom, it has to be a form
of expression and it has to be very
personal."
Not only does ballroom improve
athletic ability, it requires an ath-
letic attitude and training ethic
that go beyond that of most other
competitive activities. While most

athletes only have to train in one
sport at any given time, these
dancers have to master 10 dif-
ferent styles of dance all at once.
Every team member must perfect
the basic steps, stylistic elements
and additional moves and tricks
for each and every dance style.
The judges first focus on key
criteria like whether the danc-
ers are in time with the music,
whether their posture is correct
and whether they're natural and at
ease on the dance floor. If these are
accounted for, the judges consider
proper footwork and stylistic ele-
ments for each dance when decid-
ing who will move onto the next
round.
In other artistic competitions
like gymnastics or figure skat-
ing, specific moves are required,
but in ballroom the dancers have
complete artistic freedom within
the confines of the dance's style.
And while figure skaters and
gymnasts go into a competition
with a well-rehearsed routine in
mind, ballroom dancers don't even
know what their music will be
before it plays as the performance
begins. Routines are formed as
they dance, with moves being sig-
naled by small physical cues from
the male. Ballroom routines are
incredibly difficult to compare and
rank, considering that no two cho-
reographies are the same.
"A lot of it, being a guy at least,
is thinking about what moves you
want to do next," Lian said. "Any-
thing we want to do, we have to let
(our partner) know through our

Ballroom routines are developed entirely on the fly in competition.

bodies, thus they have to kind of
pick up on it.
"Many times our leads might
not be perfect ... and a lot of the
times their steps are a little more
complicated than ours," he added.
Ifrecallingthebasic steps, addi-
tional moves and stylistic elements
in front of an enthusiastic crowd is
stressful or daunting, the dancers
certainly don't show it. The com-
petitors are calm, cool and col-
lected both on and off the floor at
the February competition. Rowan
and his partner, recent 'U' gradu-
ate Anastasia Alekseyev, are just as
comfortable and at ease as they are
gracefully flawless.
Of course, accidents do happen.
"I've fallen. I was doing the
Viennese Waltz with my partner,
and she stepped on some guy's foot
and ... pulled me down, and we,
like, totally crashed on the floor,"
Rowan confessed. "You fall and
you get back up and you just start
dancing again."
Making champions out
of newbies
of course, an integral part of
any team is the coaches behind it,
and when a ballroom team consist-
ing mostly of dancers with little
prior experience is as successful as
Michigan's, it's clear the instruc-
tion is spot-on. Coaches Steve and
Susan McFerran are responsible
for taking beginner dancers and
working with them until they
become top competitors. They
have been coaching the ballroom
team since its establishment in
1997.
"My mom put me in ballet, tap
and jazz classes when I was four,
and so I did that until I was about
15 years old," Susan McFerran
said. "I found out about the ball-
room dancing and disco and hustle
and all these different things, and
that's when I got into the partner
dancing."
For Steve McFerran, ballroom
was always a part of his life.
"I guess for me my parents just
told me, 'That's what you're going
to do' - I didn't really have a lot
of say in it," he said. "(My parents)
competed, and then I started in a
class and the teacher said, 'There's
a girl around your age who I think
would be good,' and we went to
competitions together."
They said that after years as
successful competitors, the move
toward coaching felt right.
"It was just sort of a natural pro-
gression ... when you get toward
the end of your career as a compet-
itor," Steve McFerran said.
"If you've been successful, peo-
ple will call you, and they want
to take lessons, and they want
to have coaching from you, and
you start judging and coaching
(it's a) thing you do after you
stop competing," Susan McFerran
explained.
Their reputation as successful
instructors, coaches and competi-
tors isn't just known in the realm
of ballroom. Along with fostering a
team that has won seven national
championships, the McFerrans
have also helped ice dancers Emily
Samuelson and Evan Bates win
the World Junior Figure Skat-
ing Championships, take third at
the U.S. National Figure Skating
Championships and qualify for the
2010 Winter Olympics in Vancou-
ver. s
"These ice dancers have to do

different ballroom dances on ice,"
Susan McFerran explained. "They
have compulsory dances, and one
year it might be like tango, then
next year it might be jive, another
year it might be waltz."
The coaches of Samuelson and
Bates, Yaroslava Nechaeva and
Yuri Chesnichenko, contacted the
McFerrans because of their exper-
tise and experience with these
dances.
"They wanted to know what a
waltz or foxtrot is really like and
so they wanted us to teach them
that," Steve McFerran explained.
"When they go to portray iton the
ice and their coaches put their cho-
reography together, they can use

things that really look like ball-
room dancing."
While they may dabble in ice
dancing, the McFerrans are com-
pletely dedicated to the success of
the Ballroom Dance Team. Susan
McFerran credits "the (coach-
ing) consistency that we've been
able to have with this team" as the
main reason Michigan is often the
best among its competitors. They
approach their instruction in a
way that allows the team members
to practice individually what they
learned in their lessons.
"We try to structure it so that
we're very specific about what (the
style) should be," Steve McFerran
explained, "so that when people
come to the classes, they leave
without any doubt about what
they're supposed to do."
Beyond the weekly instruction
the McFerrans provide, the pairs
meet to practice on their own as
much as they deem necessary,
making the dancers' commitment
to the team just as important as the
coaching.
"Most people put in between
two and six hours a week," Rowan
said. "It's completely contingent
on your own interests and what
your schedule flexibility is like.
I started putting in four hours a
week; bythe end of my first semes-
ter, I was doing, like, eight to ten
hours a week."
Finding friends on the
dance floor
The Ballroom Dance Team is
one of the largest competitive
student groups on campus, with
more than 200 active members,
but it started with only eight cou-
ples. The camaraderie among the
dancers makes the team feel much
smaller.
The students on the ballroom
team inevitably become close.
More experienced dancers help
beginners learn new steps and ask
for feedback on their own moves.
They cheer each other on at com-
petitions, hoping just as much for
the success of their fellow couples
as for themselves. They go to the
studio not just to practice, but to
relax and be with their friends and
teammates.
"(The dancers) really make a lot
of friends," Susan McFerran said.
"You really feel like you can meet
so many people. It's just really
positive."
The friendship among the team
members strengthens their danc-
ing ability as they help each other
perfectthe steps and styles.
"The way ballroom is run here
is that it's very mentor-based,"
Rowan said. "You always have
someone to help you with danc-
ing. You have just an outstanding
opportunity to learn how to ball-
room dance."
There are many reasons people
get involved with ballroom dance.
But no matter what their reason
is for joining, everyone finds the
friendships they made to be the
best part of the ballroom dance
experience.
"It's the social aspect that
makes it fun. And also, well, obvi-
ously the whole 'Dancing with the
Stars' phenomenon that's spread
throughout (the country), that's
kind of given ballroom dancing a
little jump-start," Lian said. "But
when you're in the room with,
like, a hundred other people and
you get to interact ... you're doing

something with them that's fun
- that's unique - what it really
comes down to is the relationships
you build with other people."
The dancers agree that the
experiences and opportunities
they've had with the Ballroom
Dance Team are among the best
parts of their collegiate careers.
"The fact that you're a mem-
ber of a student organization
that takes in so many Michigan
students and, like, changes their
lives in an extremely unique and
unexpected way is something I'll
always look back on," Rowan said.
"(I'll) always cherish that memory
and be proud that I was a part of
this team."
