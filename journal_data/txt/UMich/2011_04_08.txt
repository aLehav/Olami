HIGHER EDUCATION
Duderstadt
proposes
plan to help
Midwest

JAKE FROMM/Daily

Former president
calls for universities
to collaborate for
regional success
By MICHELE NAROV
Daily StaffReporter
While the Midwest was a driv-
ing force in the 20th century
that helped power the rest of the
nation, today it's a vast expanse
of rusting manufacturing indus-
tries and emptied urban centers.
For University President
Emeritus James Duderstadt, the
goal is to put the Midwest back on
the map. To do this, Duderstadt
wrote a recent report outlining
the need for a knowledge-based
economy and calling for colleges
and universities in the region to
help propell the heartland into
the 21st century.
The report, titled "A Master
Plan for Higher Education in
the Midwest: A Roadmap for the
Future of the Nation's Heart-
land," was released on March 31

by the Chicago Council for Glob-
al Affairs and published as one of
the council's Heartland Papers,
which focuses on development in
the Midwest.
Duderstadt, who is also chair
of the Millenium Project - a
research center that studies the
ways technology impacts soci-
ety - explains in the report that
highereducation institutions can
act together to encourage eco-
nomic growth in the Midwest by
applying aspects of the region to
a global mindset, collaborating
instead of competing and having
educators from K-12 to higher
education work together.
Midwestern states should
unite and get out of a state-
focused mindset so the area can
have a greater presence on the
world stage, Duderstadt wrote in
the report.
Collaboration is key to the
region's success, Duderstadt
wrote. If education institu-
tions shared facilities and made
degrees easily transferrable,
universities and colleges could
provide high quality education

ST. PAUL, Minn. -
The battle wounds were
apparent.
Carl Hagelin limped
to the postgame press confer-
ence followingthe Michigan
hockeyteam's 2-0 victory over
North Dakota last night.
And Ben Winnett was a
minute late, as he strolled
in - shirt, tie and a bag of ice
taped on his left forearm - to
take a seat in front of local and

national
reporters.
They
were
signs of
the scars,
bumps
and nicks MARK
they'd sus- BURNS
tain for the
good of the
team.
Let me repeat that for you.

The team.
Tonight, Michigan shocked
the world against the Fighting
Sioux.
Okay, maybe they didn't
really shock the world like the
Fab Five did back in the early
1990s. They weren't that big
of an underdog against the
nation's No. 1 team.
But they did do something
many people within the col-
lege hockey community didn't

think was possible: beat North
Dakota - hands down the best
team coming into the NCAA
Tournament two weeks ago
and the hottest squad in the
country - in what was practi-
cally a road game.
The Wolverines arrived at
the Xcel Energy Center with
their lunch bucket and hard-
hat in tow, willing to go to
work.

By DAVID BUCCILLI
Daily StaffReporter
The issue of diversity within
* the University community took
center stage at a panel discussion

last night.
Organized by the black stu-
dent group Here Earning A Des-
tiny Through Honesty, Eagerness
and Determination of Self, or
H.E.A.D.S., the panel sought to
"break down racial stereotypes
in all communities and to spread
awareness and knowledge about
these communities," LSA senior
James Stinson III, the co-chair
of H.E.A.D.S., said.
The panel, titled "Around the
U: Perspectives of Identities,"

was comprised of eight Univer-
sity students from different eth-
nic, cultural, religious and social
backgrounds who fielded ques-
tions about their cultural expe-
riences. Over the course of the
discussion, the speakers empha-
sized how their backgrounds
have impacted their University

STUDENT PROJECT
New student mentor program aims to
help youth through after-school sports

Study presents new
way of thinking
about recovery
By JENNIFER LEE
Daily StaffReporter
It turns out that the physical
pain of heartache that follows
a break-up isn't a figment of the
imagination.

A recent study led by Universi-
ty professors, published last week
in the Proceedings of the Nation-
al Academy of Sciences, found
that social or romantic rejection
activates the same regions of the
brain that respond to physical
pain in the body.
Ethan Kross, an assistant pro-
fessor of psychology and faculty
associate at the University's Insti-
tute of Social Research, was the
lead author in the study.

"When people think about
intense rejection experiences,
they may well be experiencing
physical pain sensations in their
body," Kross said.
To determine which parts
of the brain are co-activated by
the experiences of rejection and
physical pain, Kross and his col-
leagues conducted a study in
which 40 individuals who had
recently experienced an unde-

By SARAH ALSADEN
Daily StaffReporter
This summer, a group of
University students hopes to
make an impact on children's

lives by playing basketball and
football with them.
The student-run program
called i&I Mentor for America
- "i" as a visual representation
of a small child and "I" of a col-
lege student - will offer sports
mentoring to underprivileged
youth involved in community
centers and will train college
students to be coaches and
mentors. The program will

start in Ann Arbor and will
later branch out to other towns
with universities across the
country.
Engineering senior Bo Zhu,
a member of the i&I team,
said the program will feature
a curriculum based on men-
toring and sports and will be
aimed at teaching students life
strategies that will keep them

DP Day to be highlighted
on Discovery Channel

Students discuss
success of 12th
annual service day
By CLAIRE GOSCICKI
DailyStaffReporter
After traveling to Detroit to
clean up parks and gardens in
the city last weekend, a group of
students came together again last
night to reflect on their service.
About 25 students who were
involved in the 12th annual
Detroit Partnership Day, a ser-
vice activity that aims to improve
urban neighborhoods in the city,
came together in Mason Hall to
discuss the outcome of last Sat-
urday's event. The participants
expressed excitement that the
their good deeds attracted the
attention of producers from the
Discovery Channel, which will
include footage from the day in a
three-part documentary.
Participants reflected on the
day's activities, which included
cleaning schools and painting
murals in the city, and spoke

candidly about their experience
in the city. Some said they had
never been to Detroit before the
DP Day.
More than 1,000 students par-
ticipated in the service day. Most
students worked in teams in either
the Southwest or Brightmoor
neighborhoods of the city. After
doing various service activities
throughout the city, the day con-
cluded with a rally at Detroit's Sto-
epel Park on the Northwest side.
The Detroit Partnership is
one of three organizations that
will be featured in the Discovery
Channel documentary. Business
senior Andrew Bahena, execu-
tive director of the Detroit Part-
nership, said in an interview last
night that the documentary will
premiere on the Discovery Chan-
nel in August and will focus on
social action.
"(The Discovery Channel)
is trying to bring awareness to
things that have great potential
to bring about positive change,"
Bahena said.
Detroit's distinct economic sit-
uation will add to the value of the
documentary, he added.

"Detroit is easily the most
unique city in the country
because it took the biggest fall,
and coming out of it, people are
acting in innovative ways," Bahe-
na said.
LSA junior Kaitlin Liroff,
the education director for the
Detroit Partnership, emphasized
the value of having University
students visit the city, especially
since Ann Arbor and Detroit are
so close in proximity. She dis-
cussed how, compared to her
two previous years participat-
ing in the DP Day, this year there
was a significant improvement
in participants' composure and
patience.
"I thought it went . really
smoothly," Liroff said during the
discussion. "Even if things didn't
go as planned, people were calm,
cool and collected."
Bahena discussed how one of
the most exciting parts of this
year's event was a visit from
Lloyd Carr, former head coach of
the Michigan football team. Par-
ticipants bombarded Carr with
photo requests, though he didn't
seem to mind, Bahena said.

The student panel shares their views on cultural identities at the University durin
last night.

DIVERSITY
From Page 1
Chris Armstrong, who is the first
openly gay assembly president,
said the University is a progres-
sive institution focused on diver-
sity and multicultural awareness.
"In terms of the mindsets, the
University is very diverse," Arm-
strong said. "(It is) filled with
individuals who are constantly
trying to look for experiences
outside their often personal com-
munities."
However, LSA senior Roder-
ick Morrison, the other co-chair
of H.E.A.D.S., said the University
doesn't do enough to accommo-
date its diverse population.
"I would go as far as to say
that the U of M accommodates
for us, but it is not ... an authentic
accommodation," Morrison said.
Later, Morrison added that,
"Diversity cannot be forced in
an environment where you just
place people with different iden-
tities in a room."
LSA senior Rachel May, presi-
dentof Zeta Sigma Chi Multicul-
tural Sorority, Inc., said though
the University is diverse, people
from different backgrounds
often choose to remain within
the comfort zone of the groups

they identify with.
"Despite our being a diverse
campus, we're also very segre-
gated," Maysaid duringthe panel
discussion. "There are so many
clubs and groups and organiza-
tions for people to come together
over their likenesses, but there's
not eoough for people to come
together about their differences."
May illustrated this with a
story about having to prove her
Jewish identity ina conversation
with another student.
"After class one day I was talk-
ing to a student, and I told her
that I was Jewish," May said,
adding that the student proceed-
ed to ask if she was "really Jew-
ish or kind of Jewish."
May said she felt her religion
was called into question because
of her race.
"I can't help but think that if I
wasn't black, she wouldn't have
asked me that question," May
said.
LSA junior Sarah Awad-Farid,
who is a member of the Egyptian
Student Association, said she it
is difficult to find somewhere to
pray during the day. However,
once she finds a place, Awad-
Farid said she still faces chal-
lenges.
"It is really uncomfortable
praying in an open space, and you

g a discussion sponsored by H.E.A.D.S.
don't want to make other people
uncomfortable," she said.
While some students said
they feel the University doesn't
entirely accommodate their
beliefs, Kinesiology senior
Dorian Shaw said as a member of
the softball team that she felt the
University was sometimes too
accommodating just because she
is an athlete.
"Everythingthatyoudo is cen-
tered around South Campus and
the Athletic Department, which
is really convenient," Shaw said.
"But at the same time, it kind of
cuts you off from the rest of cam-
pus."
Because of this feeling of sepa-
ration, Shaw said she has some
friends who refuse to wear Mich-
iganathletic geartoclassbecause
they would be recognized as a
student-athlete. She added that
classmates have talked to her and
fellow athletes about having oth-
ers do their work and not having
to work as hard as other students.
Interviewed after the panel,
Stinson said the discussion pro-
vided an important forum for
an eclectic range of speakers to
express their personal experi-
ences and to listen to others.
"This was an opportunity for
everyone to be heard equally,"
Stinson said.

Michigan to close
23 state forest
campgrounds
Michigan parks officials said
yesterday they plan to close 23
state forest campgrounds on May
19 as they continue to grapple
with budget reductions.
The campgrounds are located
in the state's Upper Peninsula
and northern Lower Peninsula.
The closings were to be for-
mally proposed at a meeting of
the state's Natural Resources
Commission. Department of
Natural Resources Director Rod-
ney Stokes could sign an order
directing the closings early next
month.
The rustic campgrounds tar-
geted for closing are seldom-used
compared to other campgrounds.
Many of them are near some of
the other 110 state forest camp-
grounds that would remain open
for the upcoming season.

Firm in India halts
sales of execution
drug to U.S.
A pharmaceutical company in
India says it is no longer going to
sell a key lethal injection drug to
U.S. prison officials.
It's the latest firm to stop sell-
ing the drug to states in the U.S.
amid a severe shortage of the
drug sodium thiopental.
Kayem Pharmaceutical posted
a statement on its website yester-
day, citing its Hindu beliefs in the
decision to stop selling the drug.
Nebraska announced in Janu-
ary it had acquired 500 grams
from Kayem, which is based in
Mumbai. A company salesman
says he also sold the drug to
South Dakota, but state prison
officials couldn't immediately be
reached.

Rep. apologizes
for calling bishop
a 'pedophile pimp'
The Republican leader of the
New Hampshire House has apol-

A spokesman for state Rep.
D.J. Bettencourt says yesterday's
private meeting with Bishop
John McCormack went well and
he's pleased. Spokesman Jim Riv-
ers says Bettencourt isn't com-
menting on the discussion.
McCormack was an aide to
Cardinal Bernard Law in Bos-
ton, where the Catholic sex abuse
scandal began. He was in charge
of investigating sexual miscon-
duct allegations.
The Salem politician last week
called the bishop a "pedophile
pimp" who should've been led
from the Statehouse in hand-

cuffs after criticizing deep cuts
to social services in the House
budget.

Ukrainian gov't.
accused of role in

An opposition lawmaker in
Ukraine is accusing the gov-
ernment of involvement in the
disappearance of a Palestinian
engineer who later turned up in
an Israeli jail.
Dirar Abu Sisi vanished from a
train in Ukraine Feb. 19, and sur-
faced in detention in Israel short-
ly after. Israel charged him this
week with being a senior member
of the militant group Hamas. Abu
Sisi denies the charges.
Ukrainian authorities said
they were not involved in the
operation. The Palestinian is
married to a Ukrainian and was
in the country to apply for citi-
zenship.
Lawmaker Hennadiy Moskal
claimed yesterday that Interior
Ministry agents took Abu Sisi
off his train, transported him to
Kiev airport and put him on a
plane to Israel.

HOCKEY
From Page 1
In the first half of the sea-
son, Michigan coach Red
Berenson was candid about his
current crop of Wolverines not
being some of the most offen-
sively-skilled players in recent
memory, with them possibly
having to grind out their fair
share of games.
And while Michigan fans
aren't accustomed to normally
hearing those words, it's a
mantra that has carried the
team throughout the season -
it wasn't more noticeable than
tonight.
Michigan knew entering the
contest against North Dakota,
it'd need to play a defensive-
minded game. It'd need to slow
down Matt Frattin, a frontrun-
ner for the Hobey Baker Award,
and his line that combined for

69 goals this season.
And, it'd need goaltender
Shawn Hunwick to have the
game of his life.
The Wolverines got all of
that - and more.
Everywhere you looked, a
Wolverine was showing signs
of commitment all over the ice.
The team.
Seniors like Louie Caporusso
and Carl Hagelin - two of the
team's most talented offensive
players - showed their com-
mitment to the defensive side
of the red line.
Just look at Hagelin's limp.
In the first period, freshman
Derek DeBlois got destroyed
along the boards in front of the
Michigan bench, simply to get
the puck out of the zone - a
sacrifice.
And Hunwick played hands
down his best-career game
wearing the block 'M,' as he
made 40 saves to shut out the
nation's second best offense.

From the drop of the puck
to the Wolverines piling on
Hunwick to celebrate the win,
Michigan played team hockey.
With less than 40 seconds
remaining in the contest,
Hagelin blocked a shot in the
Wolverine zone, dishing the
puck to Caporusso. Caporusso
skated up the ice and had a
clear shot from the red line. He
could have easily thrown a shot
into the wide-open net - it's a
shot he could make blindfolded
nine out of 10 times.
But he didn't.
He fed a pass to senior
foward Scooter Vaughan, who
made no mistake about it as he
sent a wrister into the empty
net, sealing Michigan's berth
in the NCAA title game on Sat-
urday.
Pass. Shoot. Score.
The team.

BREAK-UPS
From Page 1
sired break-up in a romantic
relationship engaged in two
different tasks while undergo-
ing MRI scanning.
Participants were presented
with a picture of the person
who they were no longer in a
relationship with and asked to
think about the specific break-
up experience. The second
component involved a device
called a thermode, which the
researchers attached to the
participants' forearms. With
this device, they created a pain
sensation by heating the device
to the temperature of a hot cup
of coffee, Kross said.
The findings from the study,
which was funded by the
National Institute of Mental
Health and the National Insti-
tute on Drug Abuse, showed
that the experience of social
rejection prompted by the
pictures activated the same
regions in the brain that are
known to react to the sensory
experience of pain. The results
gave scientific evidence to the
idea thatbreak-ups cause physi-
cal pain, Kross said.
"When someone says, 'My
feelings hurt, my body hurts,
I'm devastated,' when they
experience rejection, maybe we
shouldn't trivialize those reac-
tions because people may well
be experiencing some type of
physical pain," he said.
Throughout the study, Kross
collaborated with Marc Berman,

a psychology research assistant
atthe University, alongwithWal-
ter Mischel and Edward Smith,
both professors of psychology
at Columbia University, and Tor
Wager, a professor of psychology
at the University of Colorado at
Boulder.
Smith said the clarity of the
results surprised him.
"We didn't know for sure
that we would be able to pick up
pain areas that are associated
with sensory experience, and
we did," Smith said. "That had
not been shown before."
The level of social rejection
the participants experienced
was an aspect of the study that
differed from previous ones
on the topic, Smith said. He
described the participants as
"people who really had a seri-
ous rejection, not a minor one
created by a laboratory situa-
tion, buta real life rejection."
While there have been many
studies conducted in the past
that examined the neural
aspects of social rejection, the
research is the first to iden-
tify the specific sensory pain
regions that are activated in
response to social or romantic
rejection, Kross said.
The study has given
researchers a desire to better
understand the phenomenon,
Kross said. He added that the
new findings also shed light on
how people should approach
recovery from negative social
experiences like rejection.
"Thinking differently about
the experience or getting
people to work through these

events might be useful in help-
ing them combat these feel-
ings and ultimately feel better,"
Kross said.
Future studies might include
the use of behavioral therapy
or standard psychotherapy in
treating patients suffering from
social rejection, Smith said.
"We can use these activa-
tions in the brain area as bio-
logical markers of the rejection
and the pain of rejection, and
once you have a marker, you can
see if it's decreasing with treat-
ment," Smith said.
Geoff MacDonald, an associ-
ate professor of psychology at
the University of Toronto, said
he thinks using these findings
as an excuse to simply medi-
cate patients - rather than
approaching recovery in a more
holistic manner - is not the
take-home point of the study.
"If all you do is numb people
to the pain with medication,
then when the medication lifts,
people haven't necessarily
formed those social bonds that
they would normally be moti-
vated to form because they're
feeling upset," he said.
MacDonald added that the
study emphasized the impor-
tance of social connections in
battling feelings of rejection
and isolation, rather than the
use of medication.
"What this research is sug-
gesting is that it's that sense of
connection to other people that
is probably the best defense
against experiences of social
pain," he said. "I would rather
have a friend than a Tylenol."

DUDERSTADT

at a lower cost, he wrote. In his
report, Duderstadt referenced a
European system - the "Bologna
Process," which standardized
education programs across states
- as a successful model.
Duderstadt's plan asserts that
administrators need to remain
dedicated to all levels of educa-
tion from kindergarten through
continued education and rec-
ognize the success and short-
comings at each stage to make
improvements.
According to Duderstadt's
report, taking these steps can
help make the Midwest an active
player on a global level.
Duderstadt acknowledged
that while manufacturing and
agricultural industries will still
exist, they will not be the prima-
ry force for Midwestern econo-
mies in the future. The new force
lies in knowledge and the ability
to produce change, Duderstadt
said in an interview with The
Michigan Daily this week.
"(The Midwest) was success-
ful in the 20th century because
it was big," he said. "Big compa-
nies, big unions, big universities,
biggovernment, but that's notthe
way the world works anymore ...
now it's about agility."
By expanding an educated
workforce in the Midwest, Dud-
erstadt and other researchers
believe the region can emulate
successful cities like Chicago and
Minneapolis, where knowledge-
based industries, including trade
and financial services, thrive.
Lou Glazer, the president of
Michigan Future Inc. - a non-
profit organization centered on
promoting a knowledge-based
workforce in the state - gener-
ated some of the research in Dud-
erstadt's report.
"To be successful, you have
to make this transition to the
knowledge economy," Glazer
said. "In making that transition,
you have to support your higher
education system, particularly
your research universities."
According to Duderstadt, the
University is making the right
moves by focusing on research
and innovation. However, the=,
University neglects areas outside
Ann Arbor, Duderstadt said.
"I don't think we're deeply
enough engaged across the Mid-
west," he said. "I think some-
times we think of our peers to

be more like Harvard and Stan-
ford, and I think there are a great
many reasons to rethink that,
and see that our collaborations
with other (Midwestern univer-
sities) are terribly important to
those regions."
However, state colleges and
universities in the Midwest also
face the challenge of diminishing
state funding, Duderstadt said. a
"When I first arrived at (the
University of Michigan), we
would drive a truck up to Lan-
sing once a week and fill it up
with money, and then we would
drive it back down and run a Uni-
versity," he joked. "Now there's
no point in driving it up there
because there's no money there."
The Michigan state govern-
ment faces a $1.8 billion deficit.
In recent years, state funding
to Michigan's public colleges
and universities has continued
to dwindle, with a 2.8-percent
reduction for the fiscal year 2011.
The trend of higher education
cuts will most likely continue the
next fiscal year, since Republican
Gov. Rick Snyder is proposing a
15-percent cut to higher educa-
tion institutions.
John Austin, director of the
New Economy Initiative for
Southeast Michigan, said Dud-
erstadt's report illustrates the
economic importance of higher
learning institutions. But for a
majority of taxpayers, state col-
leges and universities aren't a
priority, Austin said.
One of the University's
strengths that the institution
should capitalize on is attracting
world-class talent, Duderstadt
said.
"There are (a) lot of places
that are good at educating people
from Michigan, but not a lot that
can educate people from all over
the world," he said. "This one
can."
According to Juliana Kerr
Viohl, director of the Chicago
Council on Global Affairs, Dud-
erstadt's report has been the
most downloaded paper in the
series of Heartland Papers. She
said the council is non-partisan
and doesn't advocate for policy
change directly, but instead tries
to make sure information on poli-
cy assessments are spread widely.
"We just make surgthe papers
are in the right hands and that
they are available;" Viohl said.
"And we hope that people use the
information and the resources as
a springboard for action."


MENTOR

involved in the community in a
positive way.
The program will create
youth athletic teams that will
train at local community cen-
ters and schools, LSA junior
Ginny Liu, also a member of the
i&I program, said. She added
that the teams - which will be
soccer and basketball to start -
will be coached by the college
student mentors.
Liu said she conceived the
idea for the project along with
Art & Design sophomore Alex-
andra Gardner during her
introductory social entrepre-
neurship class. While work-
ing on a project to see what
changes were needed to make a
low-income community in Bry-
ant, Mich. safer, Liu said it was
apparent that the lack of space
in the community center caused
children and young adults
to venture outside to unsafe
streets and parks after school.
"A lot of times these parks
become places where teenage
gangs hang out," Liu said. "So
it's not a very pleasant or safe
place for kids to hang out."
Liu said by talking to the
children, she found that they
want to be around college stu-
dents and play sports.
"Sports is a universal lan-
guage," she said.
The idea was further devel-
oped after Zhu, Liu, Gardner
and Social Work graduate stu-
dent Eleonora Katsambouris
took an interdisciplinary social
venture creation course in the
College of Engineering's Cen-
ter for Entrepreneurship. The
group then named the program
i&I Mentor for America.
Zhu said he hopes the model,
which he compared to Teach
for America, can be used at

prestigious universities across
the nation.
"Think about UPenn, NYU,
Columbia (University), John
Hopkins (University) - all
these prestigious universi-
ties surrounded by very low-
income neighborhoods and
areas," he said. "There are
tons of very bright gifted col-
lege students and then a huge
disparity in their immediate
vicinity."
There is a large gap nation-
wide between the number of
kids who require mentoring
versus the number who cur-
rently receive mentorship, Zhu
said.
"There are a lot of youth
who aren't being reached out
to by the existing organiza-
tions," Zhu said. "We are trying
to meet the need, not trying to
create competition."
The i&I mentoring team
will launch its pilot program
in the Ann Arbor area this July
to test if it will be sustainable
as a nationwide program. The
group will also work with at
least five community centers in
Ann Arbor, including the Peace
Neighborhood Center and Ava-
lon Housing - a non-profit that
offers support and low-cost
rental housing to people with
lower-incomes.
"We want to be able to cre-
ate a program that has the abil-
ity to assess the impact and to
empower both the kids and
the college students who go
through this program to be the
leaders of the future," Zhu said.
The group would like to
include University athletes as
mentors in addition to non-ath-
letes, Liu said. Zhu added that
he hopes the University will be
open to collaborating with the
group in the future so that stu-
dent participants will be able to
receive course credit.
Zhu also said he .thinks

the project will be successful
because coaches often have a
large impact on students' lives.
"A lot of people think back
to their high school and mid-
dle school experience, and
they remember their coaches
and their mentor figures who
invested a lot of their time into
them," he said.
Moses Lee, an academic pro-
gram manager and lecturer in
the Center for Entrepreneur-
ship, along with Nick Tobier,
an Art & Design associate pro-
fessor, teach the social venture
creation course in which i&I
mentoring was developed.
Lee said he believes the pro-
gram could expand to other
universities because many of
these higher education institu-
tions are located close to under-
privileged areas. He added
that with cuts to K-12 educa-
tion across the country, college
mentors through programs like
i&I will be beneficial.
"I think it could be tremen-
dous for a lot of these under-
resourced sports programs," he
said.
During an i&I information
session in the Michigan League
last night, LSA sophomore Leah
Hargarten said she was inter-
ested in the program because
of her previous experience as a
camp counselor.
"I hope to form some really
good relationships and really
involve myself in the commu-
nity," Hargarten said.
Education junior Michael
Tengel said he heard about the
program through the school
and is interested in participat-
ing since he enjoys sports and
working with children.
"It's important to me to
affect the Ann Arbor area as
much as I can because it has
kind of become my home since
I've spent so much time here,"
Tengel said.

Safety is a choice
Legislature should pass bill easing helmet laws
Motorcyclists may soon be allowed to drive without hel-
mets on Michigan roads. Though attempts to repeal
Michigan's 42-year-old helmet law were twice vetoed by
former Democratic Gov. Jennifer Granholm, the law may be near-
ing its end. There are two bills in Michigan's Legislature that are
attempting to amend the current law. These bills should be passed to
give responsible adults more freedom and to set a precedent that the
state shouldn't be overzealous in dictating the safety parameters of

Like a kid in Candy Land

an individual's life.
The proposed law stipulates that motorcy-
clists who are 21 years or older and posses a
$20,000 insurance policy are exempt from
a helmet requirement. There is a prevalent
fear in the public mind that in the event of an
individual being injured as a result of a motor-
cycle accident, society is inevitably going to
have to foot the bill. This argument is being
used against the new helmet law, suggesting
that an increase in injuries will lead to higher
societal costs. It's unfitting that economics
should affect the legal discussion of personal
freedom, especially when those impacted are
responsible, insured adults. The new law's
insurance policy requirement nullifies the
economic issues of the proposed bill and will
alleviate the costs that taxpayers may incur
due to medical expenses.
An obvious concern regarding the easing of
state helmet laws is the safety hazard it would
pose to motorcyclists. The National Highway
Traffic Safety Association recommends hel-
mets and says they make motorcycle crashes
less severe and highly reduce the likelihood of
fatalities. According to an April 4 Detroit News
article, some motorcyclists claim that helmets
are restrictive and limit vision and hearing,
which can potentially increase the likelihood
of motorcycle crashes. The NHTSA focuses on

statistics that deal with helmet safety in the
event of a crash, but these statistics do not con-
clude whether or not crashes are more or less
likely to occur for people who wear helmets.
Helmets give necessary protection in
the event of a crash, but that does not mean
people should be forced to wear them. Prop-
erly educated, insured and experienced adult
motorcyclists should not be forced to be safe
because other people want them to be. Ciga-
rettes and alcohol are universally accepted as
detrimental to health and potentially lethal
over time,yet they are permittedbecause their
consumption is regarded as an exercise of free
choice for adults. Like many other potentially
harmful personal choices, motorcycling with-
out a helmet should be allowed.
Motorcycle education and safety infor-
mation should be provided for individuals
attempting to get motorcycle licenses. Safe
driving courses and informative policies
should guide people to make the best deci-
sions. No one should be forced into an action
by an overprotective legal system that does
not allow for an individual to make their own
decisions. It may be a mistake to ride without
a helmet, but it would be a far greater mistake
to perpetuate legislation that eliminates per-
sonal choice.

Ann Arbor is the best place
in the world. I mean that.
I think the University of
Michigan is one
of the best Uni-
versities that
the world has
to offer. I'm not
alone in that,
either. The Uni-
versity consis-
tently ranks
among the top ERIC
schools, often SZKARLAT
higher than sev-
eral Ivy Leagues.
It helps to make Ann Arbor the best
place in the world.
While that makes me proud to go
here, it's not the only thing I love
about the University. I love all the
things the University has to offer.
Many of them I will never expe-
rience. Many of them I will, and
already have.
It's no secret that we have an
immense number of student groups.
Circle K, K-Grams, the Prison Cre-
ative Arts Project, Squirrel Club,
Michigan Quidditch, Glee Clubs,
numerous a cappella groups, the
free theater group Basement Arts
and many others help this univer-
sity offer a multitude of extracur-
ricular activities that help students
grow as intellectuals, workers, art-
ists and people.
How many times have you heard
the words, "Get involved?" It's a
staple of the University, and you're
almost peer pressured into doing so.
I hate repeating cliches, so I won't.
Instead, I want to implore you to live
each day of your time here like a kid

in Candy Land. If you do that, you
can't spend four years here without
being involved.
Did you ever play that board game
growing up? If not, you might want
to look it up. It was among my favor-
ite games. I just remember the sheer
exhilaration I felt while looking at
the board. I just marveled at it. Not
for any particular reason, but for a
sheer and inexplicable love of it. I
always wanted to be a part of it -
to meet Plumpy, Mr. Mint, Queen
Frostine and Princess Lolly.
I got the same feeling when I
played that game growing up that
I do every time I walk past the
Law Quad - and I really look at
the architecture - and every time
I learn about how some University
alum has made the news or done
something significant. Maybe it's
pure aesthetic, but to me it's magi-
cal. And the best part about it is that
it's real.
Sometimes, I'm a bit overzealous.
(Those who know me well are laugh-
ing at the truth in that statement.)
But I'm just so overjoyed by the fact
that I go here, and not anywhere
else. One day, I'd love to teach here.
I definitely want it to be the first uni-
versity my children consider. I hope
that I can help them achieve that
goal throughout their childhood and
teenage years.
School is tough. I don't need to
tell anyone that. Exams wear you
down. Papers keep you.up all night.
But remember that at this university,
you have so many opportunities to
do something important.
Every day I'm motivated by the
fact that I was told I wouldn't get

in here. I had the grades, I had the
extracurricular activities, I had the
ACT score, but my high school coun- 0
selor said I wouldn't get in. If I took
her advice to give up applying, you
wouldn't be reading this. I'd prob-
ably be going to Michigan State Uni-
versity and majoring in something
completely different. (I don't think
my dad or grandfather would ever
have forgiven me.)Yet here I sit, on a
Block M blanket that is draped over
the futon in my room.
'U' is one of the
best schools in
the world.
I'm euphoric just to be sitting in
my room, surrounded by maize and
blue. But maybe Michigan doesn't
strike a chord with you as it does
with me. That's fine. I wish every-
body could be as enchanted by this
school as I am, butI understand not
all will. And I know it's not perfect.
But when a friend of a friend asked
me if I liked going here, I found
myself speechless. I couldn't express
the profound joy I felt. I wanted to
say something about everything,
to surround her with all the sweet
opportunities she would have at her
feet if she came here - like a kid in
Candy Land.

Facebook is taking over the world

SEND LETTERS TO: TOTHEDAILY@MICHIGANDAILY.COM

Column's evaluation off
religion is startling
TO THE DAILY:
The language used in Dar-Wei Chen's arti-
cle (Religion is becoming extinct, 4/5/2011) is a
bit startling. The terms "religious baggage,"
"religion excuse" and the statement, "The
Internet and science are exposing many reli-
gious beliefs," offend me for many reasons,
yet I only have 300 words, so I will be brief.
It is very convenient to be so confident that
religion will be "eradicated" when the 21st
century has brought relative prosperity to
the developed world so far. But what of the
dictatorships? Those comrades living under
oppression of every variety must no doubt be
further purged of their religion as well, am I
right? This clearly Stalinist view of bringing
the lowly peasant out of his ignorance is truly
entertaining, especially when the memory of
the millions who have beenkilled in secularist
Chen's argument disregards
facts and history
TO THE DAILY:
This is in response to Dar-Wei Chen's col-
umn (Religion is becoming extinct, 4/5/2011).
I was thinking about responding to his opin-
ion with a logical discussion of religion,
which is as much a universal constant in
mankind as the doubt of religion. I would
have mentioned how every person - even an
ardent atheist - has a God: something that
gives people meaning, something that people
worship and somethingfor which people will
sacrifice everything.
Additionally, I would have made a logical
argument that absolutes cannot be proven.

purges has been forgotten.
I spoke with my grandmother on the phone
last night, and we talked of politics, as usual.
She spoke of living in communist Romania
under mental and religious oppression dur-
ing the last century. It is still hard for her to
believe that she was once forced to choose
between a life of scientific study or religion
(she chose science, so the Romanian secret
police wouldn't take her away). My point is
that people should always be free to choose,
with most everything. Christian Orthodoxy,
a branch of Christianity I doubt many have
heard of, has quite a peaceful and meditative
history that brought hope to so many of the
Eastern Bloc.
I have far too much to say for so little time
and 300 words. I have spoken of Christianity,
because I know that religion best, and I know
that it has followers that have done too much
good in the world to be hounded as they are.

Since I saw "The Social Network" a couple months
ago, I've been terrified. Terrified to go on my comput-
er and know that without meaning to, muscle memory
will open an Internet tab to Facebook. Terrified when
I'm pretending to do work in the Law Library, and I
see Facebook open on 13 out of 14 computers. Terrified
that Facebook has begun to take over the world and that
Mark Zuckerberg and his team don't appear to be stop-
ping any time soon.
First, let's quickly consider exactly what Facebook
is. A fun social network that has changed the way we
interact with the world? Yes - but that's what they want
you to think. It doesn't take any stretch of the imagina-
tion to see Facebook for what it really is: an enormous
company that 1 in 13 people in the world entrust with
their personal identities, interests and relationships. It's
a website on which we say, "Here's what I like, now sell
me something." In short, it's the greatest marketing tool
ever created.
Facebook's power as a personalized advertisement
generator may be ingenious, but recent events in Egypt,
Tunisia and Libya demonstrate that its history-altering,
political power is utterly mind-blowing. While Twit-
ter sustained rebellion movements, their beginnings
were on Facebook as groups and events. After the his-
toric events in Egypt this February, my political science
professor even titled a lecture "From Facebook to Tahir
Square." Facebook's power terrified the Syrian regime
after thousands of users clicked "attending" the Days of
Rage protests against the government.
Facebook's power to mobilize the masses - especially
youth - is clear. I truly believe that Mark Zuckerberg
has the power to overthrow an unstable regime. It may
sound outlandish, but hear me out. First, Zuckerberg
could create a Facebook event, or several events, for
protests. Unlike other organizers who can only reach a
portion of Facebook users, he could send multiple event
invitations to every user in a region or country. Then,
he could constantly bombard invitees with messages
reminding them to attend protests and encouraging
rebellion - including plans for a new Zuckerberg-head-
ed government after the current regime is ousted. As
unlikely as this is, it wouldn't take Zuckerberg more

than a few minutes and mouse clicks to organize.
Aside from government-destroying conspiracy theo-
ries, recent miniscule changes to Facebook illustrate its
ability to dominate. As of recently, Facebook users now
simply hit the "enter" key to post comments and other
notifications, instead of clicking a "post" button. Also, the
picture viewing application now hovers over the user's
current page, instead of existing as a separate page.
While these changes may seem insignificant, closer
examination reveals the motives behind them. Instead
of having to move your hands to post a comment, frac-
tions of a second are shaved off the action by simply
clicking "enter." Multiply these fractions of seconds by
Facebook's 500 millionusers, and that equals thousands
of added hours of surfing. Being able to see another page
underneath the photo application allows Facebook users
to return to the profitable pages more quickly. These
benefits emphasize Facebook's agenda: to get users on
Facebook more frequently, to keep them on for longer
and to view as many advertisements on as many pages
as possible.
A less recent change to Facebook is what I find most
troubling. I, like most students, was subjected to friends'
constant whining about Facebook's decision to show
pictures for its instant message feature instead of list-
ing friends' names. At first, I couldn't think of any reason
why the change had been made. It was more confusing
and less user-friendly - usually the opposite of Face-
book's updates.
As I thought about it more, however, it was a brilliant
move. Though it bothers users, the change forces them
to memorize their friend's profile pictures in order to
chat efficiently. That way, at some subconscious level,
we're basing recognition of a users' presence in terms of
their profile picture, not their name. Zuckerberg wants
the world to think in terms of Facebook - profile pic-
tures and statuses - in lieu of names and voices.
However paranoid I may be, along with more than
500 million others, I log on several times a day. Face-
book wants to take over our lives, and we continue to
help it do so.

Therefore all systems (even science) must
start with a belief that must be assumed and
can be doubted, and the best we can hope to
do is find one that works and is not self-con-
tradictory. Finally, I would have pointed out
that differing ideas, doubt and contact with
other belief systems is as old as mankind.
Therefore, global communication offers
nothing new.
However, it was obvious from his tone and
blatant disregard for facts and history that
Dar-Wei Chen was just trying to be childish
and arouse bickering. Therefore, I will glad-
ly accommodate the level of conversation.

knowledge of
Japan has grown significantly
- as has its interest in the tiny
island nation. In the aftermath
of multiple devastating natural
disasters, Japan has garnered
the attention and aid of West-
ern nations more than ever. In
the midst of these recent events,
this weekend the University of
Michigan Gilbert and Sullivan
Society presents "The Mikado,"
a work that reflects the West's
deep-rooted fascination with
Japanese culture.
Set in imperial Japan, Gilbert
and Sullivan's 1885 operetta is
a madcap work of satire driven
by comedic love-triangles, mis-
taken identities and ridiculously
impossible legal loopholes. In
writing this outrageous work,
Gilbert and Sullivan were hop-
ing to capitalize on Victorian
England's recent craze for Jap-
anese art and culture. Much

That's just a minor hitch,
though - the worst part of
"Insidious" is the laughable end-

allusion to their thematic under-
current, but "Insidious" builds
tension to a fever pitch and dis-
pels it with a plot thread that
comes straight out of left field.
When Renai and Josh reach wit's
end, they call on a medium. She
walks into the house, surveys the
situation and acts as a deus ex
machina, introducing an absurd
element into the story in a des-
perate attempt to distinguish it
from "Paranormal."
"Insidious" does its job as a
horror film, and the astral pro-
jection theme adds an inter-
esting twist. Still, the premise
borrows a bit too heavily from
its predecessors. Peli needs to
stop trying to capitalize off his
first film and start giving view-
ers a new reason to cringe.

ated a partnership with Mehta
in which some of the Glee Club
members accompanied his recent
show, and in return, a number of
his percussionists will accompany
the Glee Club on Saturday.
"It will be cool to have so many
percussionists and make it as
authentic an experience as pos-
sible," said Matthew Griffith, an
LSA junior and the public rela-
tions manager of the Men's Glee
Club.
While this new destination
may come as a shock to some, the
Glee Club has a history of travel-
ing to exotic places. The club has
traveled all around the country,
but has also jet-setted to Aus-
tralia, Spain and Great Britain.
Next year, the group plans to
visit China for its international
tour, which occurs every four
years. The club also performed
in Estonia in 1992, after it
declared independence from the
former USSR.
This trip to Cuba - which
takes off May 9th and ends May
14th - is goingto be aunique stop
for the men of the Glee Club.
"It's a ridiculously unconven-
tional and rare occasion, and we
thought that it would be great for
usto investtime inmakingithap-'
pen," Griffith said.
Historically, Americans have
not been allowed to legally travel
to Cuba. Some may even think it
is dangerous, but the University's
help and financial support, com-
bined with the fact that this trip
is a cultural exchange, allowed
for the visit to take place.
Canada and runs for one week
there in the fall, showing over
50 independent adventure and
mountain culture films. The best
films then go on tour throughout
the U.S. and Canada.
"You get to pick which films
you want to show," said Jeremy
Doody of Outdoor Adventures.
"At each stop, you get something
else out of it. You don't just see
the same thing."
This year, the Ann Arbor
BANFF Festival will feature films
on sports like Midwest moun-
tain biking, whitewater paddling,
monoskiing and, of course, moun-
tain climbing. The main feature of
the evening is a film called "A Life
Ascending," which tells the story
of a family living in the moun-
tains and the lessons its members
learn. There will also be an inter-
mission with raffle prizes and

"It was muchmore ofastruggle
to make it happen, and that makes
it that much more valuable," said
Raul Jimenez, MT&D sophomore
and campus publicity manager of
the Men's Glee Club. According
to Quackenbush, the obstacles
included hiring a lawyer and fill-
ing out mounds of paperwork
months prior to the trip.
The men of the Glee Club are
performing in Havana, Cuba's
capital, and in Matanzas, a more
traditional Cuban city. The club
will be performing for both gov-
ernment officials and the pub-
lic. The concerts will be free of
charge because the men want to
reach out to as many Cuban peo-
ple as they can.
"We're used to havingourpeo-
ple who follow us, and it will be
interesting going out there and
performing for a group of people
who speak a completely different
language and have completely
different customs," Jimenez said.
"I think it's going to be really
great."
According to Quackenbush,
Cuba has a strong choral tradition
because the arts are completely
funded by the government.
"They have exceptional choral
conductors who, unlike here in
the states, have a guaranteed liv-
ing if they go into the arts- so it's
a kind of a unique setup," he said.
Not only are the members tak-
ing part in two choral concerts
during the visit, but they also
plan to do community service,

with a passion for the outdoors
like Bivouac and Moosejaw.
"Outdoor Adventures is a
place where we try to encour-
age people to get out and try new
things," Doody said. "This is
kind of a different take on that,
where we expose people to other
adventure-type sports."
The strength of the festival
resides in its ability to bring in
people who have an interest in
the great outdoors and the envi-
ronment and at the same time
allow for anyone to sit back and
enjoy the rush of adrenaline that
accompanies these sports.
"It's really all about the films,"
Doody said. "It's a fun and new
experience every time. Each
year we try to make it bigger and
better."

McCarthy's new film is a 'Win'

'Win Win' is
versatile and
unclassifiable
By TIMOTHY RABB
Daily Arts Writer
Director Thomas McCarthy
("The Visitor") has done some-
thing highly ironic in his newest
conversation
piece, "Win
Win" - ironic
because by vir- Win Win
tue of avoiding
grandeur, he's At the
given us some- Michigan
thing truly FoxSearchlight
grand.
In an even-
paced manner that recalls the
independent dramedy "Side-
ways," McCarthy acquaints
us with the everyman life of
Mike Flaherty (Paul Giamatti,
"Duplicity"), small-time lawyer
by day, high school wrestling
coach by night and flat broke
regardless. When Flaherty
discovers a hidden prodigy in
troubled teen Kyle Timmons
(newcomer Alex Shaffer), he
thinks he's found the answers
to his financial woes and the key
to ending his wrestling team's

embarrassing losing streak. But
when Kyle's deadbeat mother
shows up to stir up trouble, Fla-
herty reaches a moral impasse
that makes him question his
motives for helping Kyle.
Typical light drama? Perhaps,
if you change your default notion
of "typical." Though McCarthy
avoids the shock-and-awe sto-
rytelling of a triumphant sports
tale, he also abstains from genre
conventions that would have
wasted an excellent character
piece on mainstream cliche. But
before trying to pinpoint exactly
what his new film is, it'd be best
to first specify everything it isn't.
Most importantly, it's not
a sports film. It seems like
"Remember the Titans" estab-
lished a modern template that
outlined what a good sports
film should be, and blockbuster
sports films have copied it over
and over, in every conceivable
way. Instead of mimicking the
formulaic, sauntering gait of
copycat inspirational films like
"The Longshots" and "Mira-
cle," McCarthy went the way of
"The Wrestler" and "Invictus"
by using the sports theme as a
backdrop for an examination of
character.
It's not what you'd expect
from a drama. either. because

it's never quite clear who's right
or wrong. McCarthy levels the
playing field between Flaherty
(with his questionable legal stan-
dards) and his rivalry with Kyle's
mother (with her history of drug
abuse and shameless freeload-
ing). In crafting these complex
personalities, McCarthy shows
us that morality is not a scale
that judges the weight of rights
and wrongs. He places far more
emphasis on a person's ability
to recognize his or her wrongs
and make them right, especially
when the well-being of others
depends on it.
"Win Win" isn't even a com-
edy. Most recent comedies -
even the easygoing "Sideways"
- hyperbolize human speech,
thought and behavior until
characters are reduced to cari-
catures. McCarthy fills us with
lust for life and laughter, not at
the expense of zany sociopaths,
but with the authentic quirks of
real people.
We chuckle at Kyle, the world-
class-wrestler, because he's the
epitome of a troubled adolescent
- aloofunexpectedly perceptive
and too independent for his own
good. We laugh aloud at Kyle's
grandfather Leo (Burt Young,
"Kingshighway"), equal parts
senility and cogency. Best of all

could range from crop work to
helping with construction. They
are also planning to work with
schools to build musical bonds
and have an enlightening shar-
ing of customs.
"It's sort of like our way to say
'we're here, we got here and we
want to give back,' " Jimenez
said. "I think it will be cultur-
ally eye-opening. Cuba is a very
different country and is in very
different conditions. But I think
it's very beautiful and has alot to
offer."
The club prides itself on its
community service and diversi-
ty, but also on its ability to stick
to its "three pillar" adage: tra-
dition, camaraderie and musi-
cal excellence, as the Glee Club
slogan states. This trip will be
nothing short of an homage to
that - especially on the side of
camaraderie.
"The fact that we're doing
this together makes it so rich *
and so meaningful and so abso-
lutely fantastic," Griffith said.
As the Glee Club will be rep-
resenting Michigan and Amer-
ica on this trip, the members
want to make a good impression
on the country.
"And of course, we're wearing
our Michigangear," Griffithsaid.

Men's Glee Club.

"Guess which hand has the quarter ... now pound that bastard."

are Flaherty and his coaching
friends Terry (Bobby Cannavale,
"The Other Guys") and Steve
(Jeffrey Tambor, TV's "Arrested
Development") and the way they
react with deference and awe at
Kyle's uncommon talent, playing
every angle for a chance to win
the state championship.
But if "Win Win" is not a

sports movie, drama or com-
edy, then what is it? The simple
answer is that it's a movie about
life. Sure, the story of a child
prodigy has a cinematic quality
to it, but Kyle's success doesn't
depend on whether he wins or
loses, only on whether the out-
come changes him for the better
or destroys him forever.

" Kim shoots first-round 76 at The Masters

By KEVIN RAFTERY
Daily Sports Writer
AUGUSTA, Ga. - At the start
of his first round on Thursday,
Michigan senior Lion Kim stood
behind the first tee at Augusta
National and watched two-time
Masters Champion Jose Maria
Olazabal and
20-time PGA KEVIN
Tour Champi- RAFTERY
on Davis Love
III both push
their drives to At the Masters
the right and
into trouble.
The miscues of two of the
PGA Tour's best golfers left Kim
unfazed.
"I was confident, there's no
question," Kim said after the
round.
Kim teed up his ball and took
three steps back. He took three
practice swings, pointed his club
at the fairway, closing one eye
to get the best possible angle of
where he envisioned hitting the
ball. One deep breath, and he
walked up to the ball - it was the
same routine at every tee box.
With the weight of the golfing
world on his shoulders, he pulled
the trigger and striped his drive
right down the middle.
Two strokes later, Kim secured
his first career birdie at the Mas-
ters after sticking a seven iron to
eight feet and draining the putt,
center-cup.

"It doesn't get any better (than
that)," Kim said. "It's the best
start you could ask for as an ama-
teur."
After one hole, the board fol-
lowing the 12:31p.m. starting time
group read: Kim 1-under, Love III
1-over, Olazabal 1-over.
But eventually, Kim's inexperi-
ence caught up to him en route to
a first round 4-over, 76.
"You have to learn your way
around the course," said Love III,
who shot 3-over par. "I saw (Kim)
do a couple things where I was
just like, 'Don't lay up over there.
Lay up on the other side of the
fairway.'
"I think that experience is
worth a few shots, and probably
the difference for the first timers."
Kim's first miscue came on
the fourth hole, a 240-yard par 3,
when Kim yanked a hybrid club

He hit the bunker shot to about
10 feet from the hole but couldn't
convert the putt, resulting in his
first bogey of the day.
And that was justthe beginning
of his troubles with controlling
the draw he had been practicing
all week.
After taking a bogey on the
sixth hole by overshooting the
green on the 180-yard par 3, Kim
pulled his second shot to the left
again on the 570-yard par 5.
He was left with a nearly
impossible third shot, having to
contend with eight trees that lied
between him and the green.
He muffed the shot and
advanced the ball only about 10
yards, leaving him with a fourth
shot from the brush.
He made a 10-foot putt to save
bogey and drop to 2-over on thfe

green lined with water on the left
side.
"I was not committed (to that
shot)," he said. "I had to cut that
shot a little bit, and I came right
over it."
The mistake left Kim's ball in
the pond, and it led Kim to his
first and only double bogey of the
day.
But two holes later, Kim earned
a stroke back on the 510-yard,
par-5 thirteenth hole with a bird-
ie after sinking a 5-foot left-to-

right putt.
He parred the next three holes,
but ran into some bad luck on No.

"I thought I hit a good drive,
and then it hit a tree branch and
just kicked way left," Kim said.
The unfortunate break left Kim
214 yards from with two trees
directly in his path, leading to his
fourth and final bogey of the day.
While Kim may have been
disappointed with his score, the
experience today - playing in

front of a national television audi-
ence and thousands of people at
Augusta National - is something
that can't be given a score.
And with a solid round tomor-
row - probably with ascore of par
or better - Kim still has a good
chance of making the cut.
"It was unbelievable playing
with Davis Love III and Olaza-
bal," he said. "Obviously, individ-
ually, I'm not pleased with how I
played, but overall it was a great
experience. I can't complain."

By TIM ROHAN
Daily Sports Editor
Denard Robinson casts a long
shadow.
Standing in it is a 6-foot-4 pro-
tege with a strong arm and long
strides, waiting his turn, techni-
cally with a longer shadow..
Both are mobile quarterbacks,
with speed to burn - there's no
question Robinson has more of it.
But Devin Gardner has one
thing on Michigan's starting
quarterback: size.
"He's a little more of a proto-
type, in that he's tall and can see
the field," Michigan offensive
coordinator Al Borges said.
This spring, while all eyes are
fixated on Robinson and his tran-
sition to the pro-style offense,
Gardner is making the same
change, and just as smoothly.
"Devin is formidable," Borg-
es said. "Devin is doing a nice
job. Devin's a good quarterback.
Devin's done some really good
things. He has some of the same
traits, as far as pull the ball down
and run.
"Denard does some things that
are dynamic that I can't coach
- that nobody can coach. Devin
does some of those too. They play
the position similar in some ways
and different in others in that I
think Devin can work inside the
pocket because of his profile, very .
naturally."
Borges added that Robinson
can work in the pocket, but his
profile doesn't fit the mold of
throwing over and around a tall
offensive line as Gardner's does.
Michigan fans tasted, if for
only 10 pass attempts, what the
future holds in week four against
Bowling Green last season. Gard-
ner completed 7-of-10 passes for
85 yards and a touchdown, and he
also ran for another score.
It was just ayear ago, duringthe
2010 Spring Game, when Gardner
received aswarm reception in the
Big House as the Michigan fans
recognized the arrival of the five-
star recruit.
This spring, he has been put-
ting in the work to improve. With
Tate Forcier's transfer, Gardner
is the Wolverines' only reliable
backup to the injury-prone Rob-
inson.
"(Gardner's) an ambitious kid,"
Borges said. "He spends a lot of
time watching film and trying
to get up to speed on what we're
doing. He has improved at a steady
rate. He's an accurate passer ...
I've been very happy with Devin's
progress. I think he's going to be
a good one before it's all said and
done."
Borges also had kind words

Quarterback Devin Gardner has demonstrated an ability to be effective inside
the pocket in new coach Brady Hoke's pro-style offense.

ment.
But with Michigan coach Brady
Hoke's mantra of competition at
every position, one question natu-
rally comes to mind: Is the Big Ten
Offensive Player of the Year's spot
safe?
Probably.
"Devin is doing his darndest to
see to it that he pushes that issue
and he's done a good job with it,"
Borges said. "But at this point,
Denard's our quarterback. I've got
no reason to believe he's not going
to be our quarterback. Everything
is pending, you never know. But
they both have done a good job.
And they're competing and I love
it - I love it."
One possibility, which Rich
Rodriguez employed at times with
Robinson and Forcier in 2010, is a
rotation between Robinson and
Gardner.
Last year, Rodriguez and the
other offensive coaches said they
had plays they liked to run more
with Forcier than Robinson.
And the boilingpoint came dur-
ing an ugly win at Purdue, when
Robinson was pulled - due to
poor play, not injury - and Forcier
didn't generate much either.
At the time, Robinson insisted
that sitting on the sidelines didn't
negatively affect his game.
But Borges isn't exactly a fan of
the two-quarterback gimmick.
"With the game in the bal-
ance - not much," Borges said.
"I've never been a believer in that.
That doesn't mean we won't do it.
But I've never been a believer in,
'Well, let's play him a series in the
first half, see how he does, get him
a little experience.' And then you
put him in there and he throws an
interception, you lose 10-7.

"But I don't know, I'm not say-
ing we won't do that. Brady and
I got to talk about that after the
spring."
Borges did note that when he
was coaching at Auburn, Georgia
rotated the pocket-passing David
Greene with the uber-athletic
D.J. Shockley and found success.
Shockley threw about four passes
per game during Greene's senior
season in 2004 - Greene gradu-
ated as Division I's all-time win-
ningest quarterback.
And the next year during his
senior season, Shockley was
named an All-SEC quarterback
with more than 2,500 passing
yards and 24 touchdowns.
"(Shockley's) next year, he had
that, playing in every game, and
because of it, it really helped it,"
Borges said. "So I would never
say never. But it's never been my
approach as a coordinator."
, Gardner may have four more
years of eligibility remaining, if he
is indeed granted a medical red-
shirt for his freshman season -
the status of which he won't know
until after his fourth year.
Conventional wisdom would
believe that Gardner will be hand-
ed the keys to the offense when
Robinson graduates or jumps to
the NFL after the 2011 season,
giving him two to three years to
creep out from Robinson's shad-
ow.
But will he see the field this
fall? That is a discussion yet to be
had.
"We're not going to make that
decision until we see all of the
cards on table, get through spring,
see where we are with the whole
thing," Borges said. "But I would
not commit one way or another."

Hunwick's 40-save shutout sends Michigan past
Sioux, to first national title game since 1998

By MICHAEL FLOREK
Daily Sports Editor
ST. PAUL, Minn. - It was Matt
Frattin and Shawn Hunwick.
Michigan's 2-0 win over North
Dakota on Thursday sent the Wol-
verines to
the NCAA MICHIGAN 2
Finals, leav- N DAKOTA 0
ing them
one game away from hoisting the
program's 10th national champi-
onship trophy.
And following the victory,
senior Shawn Hunwick sat in the
locker room - just minutes after
he had shut down North Dakota,
the overwhelming favorites with
the high-powered offense and a
Hobey Baker shoo-in - kicked
back, calmly answering questions,
with no emotion whatsoever.
With 10 minutes left in the
game, Frattin, the North Dakota
forward, picked up the puck and
made a move around senior defen-
seman Chad Langlais. With Frat-
tin on the doorstep, Hunwick came
out to challenge.
It was Frattin, the player with
the respect of the whole college
hockey world, the NHL draft pick,
the story of redemption (from
kicked off the team to Hobey
Baker award favorite). Hunwick,

the former walk-on who wasn't
expected to get significant playing
time his entire career, who won
CCHA goalie of the year based on
his stats but wasn't voted to either
All-CCHA team. The two were
face-to-face.
Frattin let go of the backhand.
Hunwick crouched down and
made the paddle stop - one of his
40 saves on the game - just sec-
onds after Michigan nearly took
a two-goal lead. It came just min-
utes after the small Michigan con-
tingent, occupying two sections to
the right of the Wolverines' bench,
felt compelled to overpower the
Fighting Sioux crow, which filled
the rest of the building, for the first
time since Michigan's goal.
And it came against North
Dakota's best player.
"When it's in a rush, it's hard to
tell if it's actually Frattin coming
in," Hunwick said. "You don't try
to worry too much about it, but you
have to know where theirstars are
at all times. (Frattin's) got 36 goals
for a reason."
Michigan was outshot by 20, but
they scored two goals - the last
one an empty netter. The first goal
came with just over six minutes to
go in the first period.
Long before the crowd watched
the majority of the game in silence,

too afraid to breathe, senior for-
ward Ben Winnett picked up the
puck off a Jon Merrill rebound.
Winnett went around North
Dakota goalie Aaron Dell, who was
sprawled on the ice and deposited
it in the back of the net.
That was all Hunwick needed.
He made kick saves on shots from
in close, blocker saves from shots
on the outside and a sliding save on
North Dakota defenseman Chay
Genoway that may have been his
best.
"I wasn't coming in with the
mindset that I was going to have
to steal one," Hunwick said. "But
once I settled in inthe second,I felt
I could if I had to."
The shutout was Hunwick's
fourth of the season, but the only
one against a team that averaged
more than four goals per game. It
was his second shutout when his
team was outshot. But the shot dif-
ferential of minus-20 this time was
a season-high.
But the most unusual thing
about it was that he didn't fin-
ish the job. The Fighting Sioux
pulled their goalie with just 1:12
to go. Hunwick made two saves
and as the puck bounced out to the
point, North Dakota Danny Kristo
charged in and let go of a shot -

ST. PAUL, Minn. - He had only
scored three goals heading into
last night's Frozen Four matchup
with No. 1 North Dakota, but that
was a statistic that didn't matter to
Michigan forward Ben Winnett.
The senior has played vari-
ous roles for the Wolverines this
season and has seen frequent line
changes and penalty-kill duties.
But even though Winnett wasn't
having the offensive campaign he
wanted, he took it all in stride.
And on Thursday night at
Xcel Energy Center, against the
nation's third best defense in the
Fighting Sioux, Winnett got his
time to shine.
In front of a sellout crowd of
19,139 - the majority of which
had been rooting for North Dako-
ta - Winnett scored his fourth
goal of the season, his first since
December. His lamplighter came
13 minutes into the first period to
give No. 2 Michigan the only lead
it would need against the Fighting
Sioux.
"That's actually been my nick-
name throughout the year: the
scoring machine, because of the
offensive numbers that I've been
able to put up," Winnett joked
after the game. "(But) to be able

ser ns fbart g Oi rat game.
Winnett, along with linemates
senior forward Matt Rust and
junior forward Luke Glendening,
had the task of matching up with
North Dakota's top line for much
of the game. The trio finished with
a combined plus-3 rating for the
Wolverines on Thursday and kept
Fighting Sioux leading scorer and
Hobey Baker finalist Matt Frattin
to a minus-2 rating.
"Going into the game, our line
knew we were going up against a
very high-scoring line," Winnett
said. "But we were able to do a
pretty good job and frustrate them
early, and I think that kind of set
the tone for the rest of the game."
As Michigan coach Red Beren-
son pointed out in the postgame
press conference, Winnett, Rust
and Glendening had a combined
16 goals heading into Thursday's
contest. The Fighting Sioux line
they faced in Frattin, Evan Trupp
and Brad Malone had over 60.
But deep in the NCAA Tourna-
ment, numbers aren't as impor-
tant as execution. And at a timely
moment for Michigan, Winnett's
goal was the much-needed first
spark for the Wolverines.
He definitely wasn't one of the
most high-profile seniors heading

into this weekend, but Winnett
will carry over this confidence
boost into Saturday's National
Championship Game.
Shortly after freshman forward
Jon Merrill rifled a shot that hit
the crossbar of the North Dakota
goal, Merrill took a shot from the
blue line that Glendening kicked
over to Winnett, who had a wide-
open right side of the net and
banged home the eventual game-
winner for the Wolverines.
"I had my head downcomplete-
ly," Winnett said. "Luke was able
to kick it to me free, and I knew
approximately where the net was
and figured the goalie wouldn't be
there that quickly. I just shot it as
hard as I could.
"Obviously getting the first goal
against a team like that, they're
not used to playing from behind
and after that we were able to
frustrate them. Our penalty kill-
ing and goaltending was very
good, and that kind of angered
them and maybe got them away
from the game plan they're used
to playing."
Both his parents flew in from
Vancouver to watch the game.
Embracing the win-or-be-done
mentality of a senior, Winnett
picked a good time to step for the
Wolverines.
He started the game out strong
on the penalty kill, making a few
nice clears of the puck out of the
Michigan zone after the Wolver-
ines took two early penalties to
start the game.
"Personally, I think Ben's had a
very interesting story here," Rust
said. "He's definitely, in my opin-
ion, one of the most skilled guys
on the team. I think he's been put
in a very difficult role in his time
at Michigan, and I couldn't think
of a better person to have that
goal than Ben."

Sioux, penalty kill stifling in win

ST. PAUL, Minn. - Sitting on
the edge of the boards at Xcel
Energy Center after the Michi-
gan hockey team's 2-0 victory
over North Dakota, the unlike-
ly group wanted to stay in the
shadow.
That's where they thrive.
Instead of standing proudly
in the locker room with press
swarming around them, fresh-
men forwards
Derek DeB- NOTEBOOK
lois, Luke
Moffatt and sophomore forward
Jeff Rohrkemper - Michigan's
fourth line - refused to be
interviewed as individuals, but
sent Rohrkemper to serve as the
line's representative.
The stipulation: His answers
needed to begin with "we" and
he had to mention his linemates
by name twice.
Check and check.
On Thursday, the trio was
far from in the shadows - they
were on the game's biggest
stage.
While many teams drop their
fourth line come playoff time,
Berenson counted on his grind-
ers for valuable minutes against
the high-powered Fighting
Sioux attack.
Berenson gives his fourth line
the task of being a "plus player"
- offensive production isn't
required, but being a brick wall
on defense is required.
And they gave their coach
both sides of the equation.
"They came out, they sparked
us when we needed a spark, and
I thought that they outplayed

the North Dakota fourth line,"
senior forward Matt Rust said.
"We talked about it on our flight
over, that our freshmen cannot
be freshmen anymore - our
freshmen need to play like soph-
omores and everyone needs to
play a year older than they actu-
ally are."
The trio was kept out of the
scoring summary, but in a game
that featured just a handful of
quality scoring chances for the
Wolverines, the fourth line was
able to drive deep into the North
Dakota zone and drive the net
with speed.
"Being the fourth line,
when we get out there it's all
about getting the pucks deep,"
Rohrkemper said. "In a close
game like that, I think that style
of play really benefitted us."
They held their own in the
defensive end, guarding against
the ferocious Fighting Sioux
offense throughout the entire
semifinal. That defensive poise
came from battling for the last
spots in Michigan's lineup.
It was a lack of attention to
defense that lost sophomore
forward Lindsay Sparks a spot
in the lineup for most of the sea-
son, and it was defense that got
Rohrkemper back onto the ice in
recent weeks.
These battles were won in the
last eight months of practice.
"Once you're out of the line-
up, you get more of an apprecia-
tion for being in it," Rohrkemper
said. "Each of us is trying to take
advantage of it, and it's good to
see that Coach Berenson putting
more trust in us."
KILLIN' IT: When Rust
received a minor penalty for

elbowing just over three min-
utes into the game, things
looked grim.
North Dakota boasts the
seventh-best power play in the
nation, entering the game at just
over a 23-percent clip.
But the Wolverines were bat-
tle-tested.
In the NCAA West Regional
against Nebraska-Omaha and
Colorado College, Michigan
fought off 12 of 13 man advan-
tages to sweep the regional.
So when the Fighting Sioux
came calling, Michigan was
prepared.
The Wolverines fought the
penalty off with ease, almost
looking stronger on the penal-
ty kill than they did 5-on-5 for
much of the first period.
Michigan went on to shut
North Dakota down on all four
of its power-play attempts
throughout the game.
Both Rust and senior forward
Ben Winnett gave the credit
to assistant coach Billy Pow-
ers, who works the penalty kill
extensively in practice.
"It speaks to the greatjob that
our coaching staff does with
scouting," Rust said. "Billy Pow-
ers truly cares about our team
and the guys who are out there
on the penalty kill. It speaks
volumes to how hard we truly
work. That was one of the most
dangerous power plays we've
faced all year."
Added Berenson: "Our pen-
alty killers were strong. Our
defense played alot in their own
zone. They held up well. I mean,
it was an endurance contest for
our team. We were playing in
our zone."
