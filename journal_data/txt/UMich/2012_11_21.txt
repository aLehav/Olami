UNIVERSITY ATHLETICS
- Brandon:
Expanded
Big Ten a
boon for 'U'

DEFACING OSU

Maryland, Rutgers
could engage large
alumni base on the
East Coast
By STEPHEN J. NESBITT
ManagingSports Editor
After days of rumors, Rutgers
confirmed Tuesday that it was
joining the Big Ten, becoming
the conference's 14th team only
one day after it was announced
that Maryland would also join
the conference.
Rutgers University presi-
dent Robert Barchi, athletic
director Tim Pernetti and Big
Ten Commissioner Jim Delany
announced the move in a Tues-
day afternoon press conference.
Rutgers' jump from the Big East
to the Big Ten will likely mean
an increase in revenue as the
school hopes to capitalize on the
conference's lucrative television
contract and national stature.
After the Rutgers Board of
Governers faxed in its applica-
tion Tuesday morning to join
the conference, the Big Ten
Council of Presidents unani-
mously voted to approve the
Scarlet Knights. Rutgers, found-
ed as Queen's College in 1766,
becomes the conference's oldest

university.
"The Big Ten includes Amer-
ica's most highly regarded aca-
demic institutions, known for
both their athletic success and
academic achievement," Barchi
said. "This is exactly the right
conference for Rutgers. Our
university is one of the nation's
leading research universities
and our student-athletes excel
in the classroom and on the
playing field."
Barchi called it "ahistoric day
for Rutgers University." Pernetti
said it was "a transformative
day."
"The- Big Ten conference is
the ultimate academic neighbor-
hood to live in," Pernetti said.
"And we're not in that neighbor-
hood, with like-minded institu-
tions, peer schools. This is not
just about collaborations on the
field of play, this is about a col-
laboration at every level."
Though Maryland announced
it would join the Big Ten on July
1, 2014, an exit policy with the
Big East has handicapped Rut-
gers in determining a date to
join the conference. The Big
East requires 27 months' notice
before a team departs, though
the Scarlet Knights are in dis-
cussions to negotiate a deal to
leave earlier.

LEGAL DISPUTE
SEC sues medicalI prof.

Gilman allegedly
involved in $276
million insider
trading scheme
By ADAM RUBENFIRE
Daily News Editor
Neurology Prof. Sidney Gil-
man is being sued by the U.S.
Securities and Exchanges Com-
mission for his alleged role in
a historically lucrative insider

trading scheme.
In a complaint filed in the
U.S. District Court of the South-
ern District of New York on
Tuesday, the SEC alleged that
Gilman provided non-public
information about a clinical trial
to Matthew Martoma, a port-
folio manager at CR Intrinsic
Investors, ahedge fund manage-
ment firm based in Connecticut.
The SEC claims that Mar-
toma's hedge funds and other
affiliated funds garnered $276
million in profits or avoided
losses in July 2008 by trading

securities before Gilman was
scheduled to make a "negative
public announcement" regard-
ing the results of clinical trials
for an Alzheimer's medication
being developed for Elan Corpo-
ration and Wyeth, Inc.. Wyeth
was acquired by Pfizer, Inc. in
2009. Pfizer occupied the North
Campus Research Complex
before the University bought the
facility.
Though it went after Mar-
toma, Gilman and CR Intrinsic,
the Wall Street Journal report-
ed that it appears that Steve A.

Cohen, founder and owner of
SAC Capital Advisors L.P., the
parent firm of CR Intrinsic, is
their final target.
Though the SEC complaint
doesn't name Cohen or SAC
Capital Advisors, it notes that
Martoma collaborated with CR
Intrinsic's portfolio manager,
known as "Portfolio Manager
A," who is identified as the
founder and owner of "Invest-
ment Adviser A" - a firm which
is also alleged to have benefited
from the scheme - and CR

SENATE ASSEMBLY
Faculty request more input
in choosing U' executives

SACUA resolution ,
asks for increased
involvement in
hiring process
By PETER SHAHIN
Daily StaffReporter
The University's Senate
Assembly Committee on Univer-

sity Affairs passed a resolution
on Monday calling for more non-
administration faculty on search
committees for the University's
executive officers.
The Senate Assembly is the
representative body of all regu-
lar faculty members on cam-
pus, and the primary advocate
for faculty concerns and issues.
Though the resolution, authored
by Scott Masten, a Business
professor and SACUA mem-

ber, carries no official weight, it
demonstrates a growing desire
among faculty for increased non-
administration involvement in
the hiring of the successors of
University President Mary Sue
Coleman and other executive
officers. Coleman's contract is
set to expire in 2014, and a search
for her replacement will likely
begin soon.

Appreciating Polish culture

Through a variety of
social and cultural events,
the University's Polish Club
- known in Polish as Klub
Polski - seeks to promote
Polish culture and foster a
close-knit community for its
members.
Throughout the year, the
organization hosts a variety
of events such as mixers and
bonfires, which are open to
all students. Though many of
the club's roughly 50 mem-
bers are of Polish descent, the
club is not limited to Poles.
LSA senior Misia Szew-
czyk, the Polish Club social
chair, said her favorite part
of the Polish Club is its close-

knit community and ties to
Polish culture. Members of
the Polish club frequently
gather at houses or residence
halls to cook traditional Pol-
ish dishes such as Pierogi and
Golapki.
"I like the sense of com-
munity and the feeling of
home away from home," Sze-
wczyk said. "Alot of people in
this club grew up with a Pol-
ish influence in their house-
hold and the club fosters that.
When you're feeling stressed
out, it's nice to have food or
songs that reminds you of
home."
The group also partici-
pates in an annual soccer

tournamentoncampuscalled
EuroCup, which serves as an
opportunity for members
of other European clubs on
campus to compete. This
year, competitors included
members of the Russian Club,
the German Club, the Turk-
ish Student Association.
The Polish Club also
hosts speakers from Poland
who are invited annually by
the Center for Russian and
Eastern European studies to
come speak at the University.
The speakers discuss current
international topics like the
European debt crisis.

Israeli missile strikes kill 3
Palestinian TV journalists

Reporters killed in
targeted airstrike of
news van
GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP)
- Israeli airstrikes. killed three
Palestinian journalists in their
cars on Tuesday, a Gaza health
official and the head of the
Hamas-run Al Aqsa TV said.
Israel acknowledged targeting
the men, claiming they had ties
to militants.
Later Tuesday, an Israeli air-
strike hit a building that houses
the office of the French news
agency Agence France Presse.
An agency photojournalist who
was in the office at the time said
the target appeared to be two
floors above him. No one was
injured and the agency office
was not damaged.
The strikes came on the sev-
enth day of Israel's offensive
against Gaza's Hamas rulers.

A number of journalists have
been killed over the years while
covering fighting between the
Jewish state and the Palestinian
militant group, but not in target-
ed strikes that Israel acknowl-
edged.
Two of those killed were
cameramen working for Al Aqsa
TV, the centerpiece of a grow-
ing Hamas media empire, said
station head Mohammed Tho-
urayh. The two were driving
in a car with press markings
in Gaza City on Tuesday after-
noon, shortly after wrapping up
an assignment at the city's Shifa
Hospital, Thouraya added.
The station said the car was
hit by a missile and broadcast
the aftermath, with the vehicle
consumed by flames. Thoura-
ya said the bodies of the two,
Mohammed al-Koumi and Hus-
sam Salam, were badly burned.
Later Tuesday, another Israe-
li missile killed an employee for
Al Quds Educational Radio, a
private station, said Ashraf al-

H--,

Kidra, a Gaza health official.
Mohammed Abu Eisha died
when his car was hit in the cen-
tral Gaza town of Deir el-Balah,
al-Kidra said.
Lt. Col. Avital Leibovich, an
Israeli military spokeswoman,
said a preliminary investigation
showed all three were Hamas
operatives, but would not elabo-
rate.
Israel has struck a wide range
of Hamas-linked targets during
its offensive, including rocket
launching sites and the homes of
suspected activists, killing more
than 120 people.
Asked whether Israel had
widened its range of targets to
include journalists working for
media run by Hamas or other
militant groups, Leibovich said:
"The targets are people who
have relevance to terror activ-
ity."
Thouraya denied that the two
employees killed Tuesday were
linked to violence.
"Our crew were fighters, but
they were not fighting with
weapons," he said. "They were
fighting with their cameras.
They were on the battlefield to
defend the people by filming
the awful crimes (of the Israeli
offensive) and broadcasting
them to the world."
Mahmoud al-Hams, the AFP
photographer, said the build-
ing housing the French news
agency shook and he could smell
fire after it was -hit. He said the
building, which is part of a com-
mercial mall, has an office of a
Hamas-related media outlet for
women, which was hit in the
strike. Families who had taken
refuge in the building from air-
strikes in northern Gaza fled
after the attack.
Over the weekend, an Israe-
li missile struck an Al Aqsa
office on the top floor of a
Gaza City high-rise also being
used by other local and for-
eign news outlets. A second
strike hit the Lebanon-based
Al Quds TV in a second media
center, causing some damage.
Al Quds TV is seen as sympa-
thetic to Hamas.

Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton
meets with
Netanyahu
JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel
and the Hamas militant group
edged closer to a cease-fire Tues-
day to end a weeklong Israeli
offensive in the Gaza Strip, but
after a day of furious diplo-
matic efforts involving the U.S.
secretary of state, U.N. chief
and Egypt's president, a deal
remained elusive and fighting
raged on both sides of the border.
Israeli tanks and gunboats
pummeled targets in Gaza in
what appeared to be a last-min-
ute burst of fire, while at least 200
rockets were fired into Israel. As
talks dragged on near midnight,
Israeli and Hamas officials, com-
municating through Egyptian
mediators, expressed hope that a
deal would soon be reached, but
cautioned that it was far from
certain.
"If there is a possibility of
achieving a long-term solution
to this problem by diplomatic
means, we prefer that. But if not,
then I am sure you will under-

stand that Israel will have to
take whatever actions are nec-
essary to- defend its people,"
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said at a late-night
meeting with visiting Secretary
of State Hillary Rodham Clin-
ton.
Clinton ' was hastily dis-
patched to the region by Presi-
dent Barack Obama to join a
high-profile group of world lead-
ers working to halt the violence.
Standing alongside the Israeli
leader, Clinton indicated it could
take some time to iron out an
agreement.
"In the days ahead, the United
States will work with our part-
ners here in Israel and across the
region toward an outcome that
bolsters security for the people
of Israel, improves conditions
for the people of Gaza and moves
toward a comprehensive peace
for all people of the region," she
said.
Clinton expressed sorrow for
the heavy loss of life on both
sides, but called for the Palestin-
ian rocket attacks on Israel to
end and stressed that the Ameri-
can commitment to Israel's
security is "rock solid."
"The goal must be a durable
outcome that promotes regional

stability and advances the secu-
rity and legitimate aspirations of
Israelis and Palestinians alike,"
she said.
In Washington, State Depart-
ment spokeswoman Victoria
Nuland said Clinton met with
Netanyahu and other Israeli
officials for two hours.
"They discussed efforts to de-
escalate the situation and bring
about a sustainable outcome that
protects Israel's security and
improves the lives of civilians
in Gaza," Nuland said. "They
also consulted on her impend-
ing stops in Ramallah and Cairo,
including Egyptian efforts to
advance de-escalation."
Israel launched the offensive
on Nov.14 in a bid to end months
of rocket attacks out of the
Hamas-run territory, which lies
on Israel's southern flank. After
assassinating Hamas' military
chief, it has carried out a blister-
ing campaign of airstrikes, tar-
geting rocket launchers, storage
sites and wanted militants.
The campaign has killed more
than 130 Palestinians, including
dozens of civilians, and wound-
ed hundreds of others. Five
Israelis have been killedby rock-
et fire, including a soldier and a
civilian contractor on Tuesday.

Feds accuse
Michigan judge of

Federal authorities filed a law-

of a Michigan Supreme Court
justice, accusing her of fraud by
hiding control of the real estate
while persuading a bank to allow
a short sale on another property.
Diane Hathaway is not
charged with a crime,but forfei-
ture complaints in federal court
typically lead to a criminal case.
In 2010, Hathaway and her
husband, Michael Kingsley,
submitted a hardship letter to
ING Bank seeking a short sale
on their home in Grosse Pointe
Park, a Detroit suburb. The cou-
ple did not disclose that they had
put their home in Windermere,

advertising, among other things,
his lawyer said Tuesday.
William Merrill appeared in

* England says no
to female bishops
LONDON (AP) - The Church
of England's governing body
blocked a move Tuesday to per-
mit women to serve as bishops in
a vote so close it failed to settle
the question of female leader-
ship and likely condemned the
institution to years more debate
on the issue.
The General Synod's daylong
debate ended with the rejec-
tion of a compromise that was
intended to unify the faith-
ful despite differing views on
whether women should be
allowed in the hierarchy. But
backers failed to gain the neces-
sary majority by six votes.
"There is no victory in the
coming days," said Rev. Angus

MacLeay. "It is a train crash."
The defeat was a setback
for Archbishop of Canterbury,
Rowan Williams, who retires
at the end of December, and his
successor, Bishop Justin Welby.

Goma as U.N. peacekeepers stood
by without resisting.
But it did not name two coun-
tries accused of supporting the
Congo rebels: Rwanda and Ugan-
da.
The council demanded that the
M23 rebels withdraw from Goma,
disarm and disband, and insisted
on the restoration of the crumbing
Congolese government authority
in the country's turbulent East.
The resolution adopted impos-
es targeted sanctions, including
a travel ban and assets freeze, on
the M23 rebel group leadership.
Individualnations are supposed to

Commutes shut
down as transit
systems strike
BUENOS AIRES, Argentina
(AP) - Argentine President Cris-
tina Fernandez faced a nation-
wide strike on Tuesday, led by
the union bosses who used to be
her most steadfast supporters.
Many workers stayed home
as the strike made commuting a
puzzle, with some trains and bus
lines paralyzed and small groups
of people blocking highways in
about a dozen places around the
capital. Banks, courts and many
schools were closed, many hos-
pitals offered only emergency
services, most Argentine flights
were canceled and garbage
wasn't being picked up.
Butinotherways, itwas a nor-
mal day in Buenos Aires, where
cafes and small stores stayed
open.
The strike was called as a
political show of force by truck-
ers union boss Pablo Moyano, the
longtime leader of Argentina's
vast General Workers' Federa-
tion, and one of the closest allies
of the president's late husband
and predecessor, Nestor Kirch-
ner.
Moyano and some other union
leaders broke away from Fer-
nandez this year as she tried to

contain the demands of a now-
divided labor movement by sup-
porting a rival slate in union
elections. He has increasingly
appeared alongside her political
opponents since then, speaking
out against the government he
long championed.
As his strikers tried to snarl
traffic on Tuesday, Moyano said
their demands include "the total
elimination of income taxes," as
well as other new salary hikes
and benefits.
The point is to make the Fer-
nandez administration under-
stand that it "can't manage the
country in the way that it does,
without providing answers,
with authoritarian attitudes,
imposing everything and defy-
ing all the world," Moyano said
in an interview with Argentina's
Channel 13.
Fernandez, meanwhile, called
on workers to act responsibly and
defend all she's accomplished
for workers in Argentina, rather
than return to a past when a rela-
tive few enjoyed the benefits of
economic growth.
"The first ones to become hun-
gry or be left without jobs will
be the workers," she warned in
a posting Tuesday on her offi-
cial Facebook page. "That's why
I want to call on my comrades,
the workers, to show great
responsibility and defend, not
my government - not at all -

but the political project that has
generated more than 5.5 million
jobs."
Most union workers won
pay hikes of 25 percent or more
this year, in line with what pri-
vate analysts say is Argentina's
true annual inflation rate, much
higherthanthe 10 percent ayear
cited by the government's wide-
ly discredited inflation index.
For most, those pay hikes put
them over the threshold to begin
paying income taxes, some-
thing many lower-paid work-
ers never had to do before. For a
single worker, that annual salary
threshold is about $15,600. Tax
rates then rise from zero to 35
percent, with most workers los-
ing about a fourth of their take-
home pay to income taxes.
"The government should stop
robbing workers with the income
tax," said the Workers' Party
leader Nestor Pitrola, who joined
a blockade of the Pueyreddon
bridge over the Riachuelo river, a
key access point from the south.
Most flights were grounded
in Argentina, frustrating tour-
ists at Buenos Aires' downtown
airport, where machinists'
union leader Ricardo Cirielli
said 100 percent of the work-
ers who maintain the jets of
Aerolineas Argentinas and LAN
Argentina were on strike. Other
international carriers weren't
affected, he said.

Countries rewrite
rules after taxing
five year effort
CORONADO, Calif. (AP) -
The United States and Mexico
agreed Tuesday to rewrite rules
on sharing water from the Colo-
rado River, capping a five-year
effort to create a united front
against future droughts.
The far-reaching agreement
signed near San Diego gives
Mexico badly needed storage
capacity by grantingrights to put
some of its river water in Lake
Mead, which stretches across
Nevada and Arizona.
Mexico will forfeit some of its
share of the river during short-
ages, bringing itself in line with
western U.S. states that already
have agreed how much they will
surrender in years when waters
recede.
Water agencies in California,
Arizona and Nevada also will
buy water from Mexico, which
will use some of the money to
upgrade its infrastructure.
U.S. Interior Secretary Ken
Salazar called the agreement the
most important international
accord on the Colorado River
since a 1944 treaty.
"We have chosen cooperation
and consensus over discord," he
said.
The agreement, coming in
the final days of the administra-
tion of Mexican President Felipe
Calderon, is a major amendment
to the 1944 treaty considered
sacred by many south of the
border. The treaty grants Mex-
ico 1.5 million acre-feet of river
water each year - enough to
supply about 3 million homes"-

making it the lifeblood of Tijua-
na and other cities in northwest
Mexico.
Mexico will surrender some
of its allotment when the water
level in Lake Mead drops to
1,075 feet and reap some of the
surplus when it. rises to 1,145
feet, according to a summary of
the agreement prepared by the
Metropolitan Water District of
Southern California, which will
buy some of Mexico's water.
The agreement expires in five
years and is being billed as a trial
run, potentially making it more
palatable in Mexico.
"These are big political steps
for Mexico to take," said Jef-
frey Kightlinger, Metropolitan's
general manager. "Chances are
we won't have a surplus and
we won't have a shortage but, if
we do, we'll have the guidelines
in place on how we're going to
handle it."
In 2007, facing an eight-year
drought, California, Arizona
and Nevada agreed on how
much each state should sacrifice
during shortages on the 1,450-
mile river that flows from the
Rocky Mountains to Mexico.
That same year, the U.S. and
Mexico promised to work on
ways to jointly address short-
ages.
The negotiations gained a
sense of urgency for Mexico
in 2010 after a magnitude-7.2
earthquake damaged canals and
other infrastructure, forcing
it to store water temporarily in
Lake Mead.
"They have some storage but
it's not enough for drought and
emergencies," said Halla Razak,
Colorado River program direc-
tor at the San Diego County
Water Authority.

Dark matter detector nears
activation in SD gold mine

Army veteran was driver of
float in Texas parade crash.

Driver seeking
professional council
to cope with grief
MIDLAND, Texas (AP) - The
driver ,of a parade float filled
with wounded veterans and
their spouses that was struck by
a freight train in West Texas is
an Army veteran himself who is
"in shock" over the accident that
killed four people, an attorney
said Tuesday.
Dale Andrew Hayden was
driving a flatbed truck that
investigators say edged across a
railroad crossing despite warn-
ing signals of a fast approaching
train, Hayden's attorney, Hal
Brockett said.
"Words can't express the sor-
row and remorse for the people
who got hurt and killed," Brock-
ett said in an interview.
The revelation of who the
driver was came as the National
Transportation Safety Board
conducted a sight distance test at
the crash site. Atrain and atruck
similar to those involved in the
accident were driven across the
site at various intervals, and the
railroad crossing was activated.
Four veterans were killed
.in the collision in Midland on
Thursday. Sixteen people were
injured.
Investigators say the float
began crossing the train tracks
even though warning bells were
sounding and the crossing lights
were flashing. A Union Pacific
train travelling at more than 60
mph ran into the truck as the
occupants scrambled to jump to
safety.
Hayden, who has a military
career spanning more than three
decades, now works as a truck
driver for Smith Industries, an
oilfield services company. Brock-

ett said the company placed
Hayden on medical leave.
Hayden is "kind of catatonic"
and not ready to be interviewed,
Brockett said. "He's just very
much in shock."
Doug Fletcher, a Dallas attor-
ney representing Smith Indus-
tries, said Hayden is an Army
reservist who has been driving
for the company for two years
and aay have driven in the
parade before.
Hayden is undergoing "pro-
fessional counseling," Fletcher
said. "He is beyond distraught."
Fletcher said the company is
taking steps to protect the driv-
er after he received "some hate
emails."
No one responded to a knock
on the door at a mobile home
listed as Hayden's residence
Tuesday.
At the NTSB sight distance
test, a train pulling 10 cars rolled
through the intersection, then
was backed up about a half mile
and driven right to the threshold
of the crossing. The train wasn't
traveling at the same speed as
the one that crashed Thursday.
The same type of simulation
was undertaken with the truck.
NTSB investigators in yellow
vests took photos.
Reporters watched from a
parking lot that still has the
painted outlines of where bod-
ies were thrown from the parade
float.
Midland police ' also are
investigating the crash, but it's
not clear what, if any, criminal
charges will be filed.
"I really can't speculate as to
what any charges might be," said
the county's district attorney,
Teresa Clingman, because the
police "investigation is not com-
plete."
John Klassen, the U.S.
attorney in Midland, said he's

unaware of any federal crimi-
nal authorities investigating the
accident.
According to the NTSB, the
railroad crossing warning sys-
tem was activated 20 seconds
before the accident, and the
guardrail began to come down
seven seconds after that.
But some Midland residents
have said there isn't enough time
between when the signal begins
and the trains arrive. They say
guardrails aren't completely
down by the time a train comes
by.
The Union Pacific freight train
heading to Louisiana was esti-
mated to be going at 62 mph at
the time of the crash.
The veterans had been invited
to Midland, a transportation and
commerce hub in the WestTexas
oilfields, for a three-day week-
end of hunting and shopping in
appreciation of their service. A
local charity, Show of Support,
had organized the trip, parade
and other festivities. Show of
Support officials have declined
to identify the driver.
Killed were Marine Chief
Warrant Officer 3 Gary Stouffer,
37; Army Sgt. Maj. Lawrence
Boivin, 47; Army Sgt. Joshua
Michael, 34; and Army Sgt. Maj.
William Lubbers, 43.
According to Army records,
Hayden holds the rank of staff
sergeant, and his occupational
specialty is light wheel vehicle
mechanic.
He began his military career
as an active-duty soldier from
1980 to 1988. He did two stints in
the Oklahoma National Guard in
the 1990s beforesigningup again
for the Army Reserve in Decem-
ber 2003, according to Army
records. He served in Iraq until
March 2005 and was deployed
to Afghanistan in 2009 until the
following September.

Ten million dollar
experiment waiting
one mile below
surface
SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP) -
Scientists hoping to detect dark
matter- deep in a former South
Dakota gold mine have taken
the last major step before flip-
ping the switch on their deli-
cate experiment and say they
may be ready to begin collect-
ing data as early as February.
What's regarded as the
world's most sensitive dark
matter detector was low-
ered earlier this month into a .
70,000-gallon water tank near-
ly a mile beneath the earth's
surface, shrouding it in enough
insulation to hopefully isolate,
dark matter from the cosmic
radiation that makes it impos-
sible to detect above ground.
And if all goes as planned,'
the data that begins flowing
could answer age-old questions
about the universe and its ori-
gins, scientists said Monday.
"We might well uncover
something fantastic," said
Harry Nelson, a professor of
physics at University of Cali-
fornia, Santa Barbara and a
principal investigator on the
Large Underground Xenon
experiment. "One thing about
our field is that it's kind of bru-
tal in that we know it's expen-
sive and we work hard to only
do experiments that are really
important."
This one hasn't been cheap,
at about $10 million, but like the
discovery of the Higgs boson
- dubbed the "God particle"
by some - earlier this year in
Switzerland, the detection of
dark matter would be a seis-
mic occurrence in the scientific
community.
Scientists know dark mat-
ter exists by its gravitational
pull but, unlike regular matter
and antimatter, it's so far been
undetectable. Regular matter
accounts for about 4 percent of
the universe's mass, and dark
matter makes up about 25 per-
cent. The rest is dark energy,
which is also a mystery.
The search in South Dakota

began in 2003 after the Home-
stake Gold Mine in the Black
Hills' Lead, S.D., shuttered for
good. Scientists called dibs on
the site, and in July, after years
of fundraising and planning, the
LUX detector moved into the
Sanford Underground Research
Facility, 4,850 feet below the
earth's surface. It took two days
to ease the phone booth-sized
detector down the once-filthy
shaft and walkways that origi-
nally opened for mining in 1876
during the Black Hills Gold Rush.
There, the device was fur-
ther insulated from cosmic
radiation by being submerged
in water that's run through
reverse osmosis filters to deion-
ize and clean it.
"The construction phase is
winding down, and now we're
starting the commissioning
phase, meaning we start to
operate the, systems under-
ground," said Jeremy Mock, a
graduate student at the Univer-
sity of California, Davis who
has worked on the LUX experi-
ment for five years.
Carefully submerging the
delicate detector into its final
home - a water-filled vat that's
20 feet tall and 25 feet in diam-
eter - took more than two
months, Mock said.
Scientists are currently
working to finish the plumb-
ing needed to keep the xenon as
clean as possible. The xenon, in
both liquid and gas form, will
fill the detector and be con-
tinuously circulated through a
purifier that works much like
a dialysis machine, pulling the
substance out to remove impu-
rities before pushing it back
into the detector.
Keeping the water and xenon
pristine will help remove what
Nelson called "fake sources"
- or stuff that scientists have
seen before, such as radiation,
that could serve as false alarms
in their efforts to detect dark
matter.
Nelson likens the experiment
to Sherlock Holmes' approach
to discovering the unknown by
eliminating the known.
Once the. data start to flow,
it'll take a month or two before
the detector is sensitive enough
to claim the "most-sensitive"
title, Nelson said.

Private mail
Drastic measures must be taken to save USPS
In the 2012 fiscal year, the United States Postal Service has
reported a loss of $15.9 billion. This is an unsustainable finan-
cial trajectory and policymakers in Washington D.C. have
realized this. In the face of this impending crisis for the USPS, many
solutions have been proposed, but none have caught on. The reality
is that Congress lacks the ability to institute structural reforms in
time to stave off a default. The best option is total privatization.
The financial difficulties of USPS are root- provided at a loss by the USPS, namely mail

Before it's too late

fter a long presidential
campaign that hardly men-
tioned climate change, it

was refreshing
to see President
Barack Obama
make a short, but
important refer-
ence to the topic
in his victory
speech on elec-
tion night.
"We want our
children to live
in an America
that isn't bur-

dened by debt, that isn't weakened
by inequality, that isn't threatened
by the destructive power of a warm-
ing planet," the President declared
to a roaring crowd of supporters in
Chicago.
Last week, in his first press con-
ference since June, Obama reiter-
ated his commitment to fighting
climate change: "I am a firm believ-
er that climate change is real, that
it is impacted by human behavior
and carbon emissions. And as a
consequence, I think we've got an
obligation to future generations to
do something about it." However,
he conceded that "for us to take
on climate change in a serious way
would involve making some tough
political choices."
Translation: Obama wants to
fight climate change, but the cur-
rent political landscape is holding
him back from making a significant
dent in the problem.
I understand the logic behind
the President's recent statements.
Since there seems to be some com-
mon ground between both parties
on issues such as the fiscal cliff and
immigration reform, it makes sense
to focus on those issues first. Howev-
er, in the process, we can'tforgetthat
climate change is the most important
issue of this era - even moreso than
the economy. It won't matter wheth-
er our economy is thriving, poverty is
eliminated or any of the other major

challenges facing our country are
resolved if we live on an irreparably
damaged planet. Several decades
from now, it might be too late to curb
the damage.
The World Bank recently
released a new report with a dire
warning: if we continue our current
policies, "we're on track for a 7.2*F
warmer world marked by extreme
heat-waves, declining global food
stocks, loss of ecosystems and bio-
diversity and life-threatening sea
level rise." According to Reuters,
the report also mentioned some
climate change effects happen-
ing now: "Arctic sea ice reached a
record minimum in September, and
extreme heat waves and drought in
the last decade have hit places like
the United States and Russia more
often than would be expected from
historical records."
But climate change isn't just
about higher temperatures. In its
summary of the report, Reuters
wrote that "all nations will suffer
the effects of a warmer world, but it
is the world's poorest countries that
will be hit hardest by food short-
ages." Underscoring the urgency of
the situation, in a recent conference
call with reporters, World Bank
President Jim Yong Kim said, "We
will never end poverty if we don't
tackle climate change. It is one of
the single biggest challenges to
social justice today."
Climate change is harmful to
our struggling economy. Harvard
Law School Prof. Cass Sunstein
recently wrote that even conserva-
tive icon Ronald Reagan supported
reducing damage tf the ozone layer
because of the economic benefits
of doing so: "Reagan's economists
found that the costs of phasing out
ozone-depleting chemicals were
a lot lower than the costs of not
doing so." Sunstein wrote, "econo-
mists of diverse viewpoints concur
that if the international community
entered into a sensible agreement
to reduce greenhouse gas emis-

sions, the economic benefits would
greatly outweigh the costs."
To his credit, Obama took some
steps ?in the right direction dur-
ing his first term: he "doubled fuel
efficiency standards on cars and
trucks" to take "alot of carbon out of
the atmosphere" and "doubled the
production of clean energy, which
promises to reduce the utilization
of fossil fuels for power generation."'
But we need to do more.
Climate change
is one of the
biggest social
issues we face.

So what can college students do
to help reduce the impact of climate
change?
We can take small steps to reduce
our individual carbon emissions,
like carpooling when we drive
home or walking or riding a bike
around campus instead of driving.
But even that won't be enough to
solve the problem.
The most important way We can
help combat climate change is to
keep pressuring our elected repre-
sentatives, senators and president
to develop legislation that will put
a huge dent in the growing prob-
lem. The influence of our' genera-
tion is grouting: according to Edison
Research's early National Exit Poll,
19 percent of the people who voted in
the 2012 election were ages 18 to 29,
which was 1 percent higher than in
2008. Politicians are listening to us.
We need to let our lawmakers
know that we are notgoing to let this
issue go away - not when we're the
ones who will have to pay the price.

CHRIS FLOYD IVIEWPOINT
Leave no man behind

It's hard to believe that within the past
100 years, issues like political participa-
tion of women and African Americans
were controversial topics
that divided the country. At
this point, it seems absurd
that anyone would believe
women or African Ameri-
cans didn't deserve the
right to vote, but there were
42 years between the intro-
duction of the 19th Amend- MARY
ment and its ratification GALLAGHER
in 1920. Now, if one politi-
cal party was to oppose
the suffrage of women or
minorities, the opposing party would overtake
them in a landslide victory, no matter how rea-
sonable the anti-suffrage party's views were on
the economy or other issues.
The Nov. 6 election has shown us that a
new group of issues may be making the leap
from controversial and partisan to accepted
facts of life in the United States. Of these, the
most obvious is same-sex marriage. The bat-
tle for gay rights began to gain steam in the
late 1960s and has made significant strides
since, with same-sex marriage legal in nine
states and Washington D.C., and the ubiquity
of realistic and progressive portrayals of the
LGBT community in the media.
However, there's still a lot of progress to be
made: 41 states continue to reject the validity
of same-sex marriage. Though, in this elec-
tion cycle, gay marriage won battles in every
single state where it was in question: Maine,
Maryland, Washington and Minnesota.
Each of these was a ballot initiative, which
means every state voter had a say. Because of
this, it can't be argued that this is a case of
the government usurping popular opinion, as
organizations like the National Organization
for Marriage have maintained about similar
court rulings or legislative decisions. The
people spoke, and they spoke overwhelming-
ly in favor of same-sex marriage.
Another oft-publicized point of contention
during this campaign was the argument over
abortion and access to birth control. Although
Roe v. Wade was passed nearly 40 years ago,
there's still a significant number of Americans
who believe that abortion should be made ille-

gal except in cases of rape or incest - some even
believe that it should be altogether outlawed no
matter the circumstances. However, it seems
that most of the population is hesitant to make
it completely illegal. Ina May 2012 Gallup poll,
77 percent of Americans responded that abor-
tion should always be legal or sometimes legal.
Despite this fact, the Republican Party contin-
ued to stand behind their position, seemingly
oblivious to the fact that they now represent a
minority of the population.
Some day, we'll
wonder why anyone
ever got up in arms
over gay marriage.
In a democracy like ours, the government
shouldbe ruledby the people, not the other way
around. It's easy to lose faith in the system and
to believe that individual voices and opinions
don't really matter. But then an election like
this comes around and reminds us that chang-
ing the minds of the voting public really can
make an impact on the government.
It seemed like the way many people framed
this election was around the issues of gay
marriage and abortion, rather than on more
complex subjects such as the economy or the
environment. I prefer these Democratic eco-
nomic models to that of the Republican Party.
However, I'd rather hear an election that was
a debate between two different plans to actu-
ally make the United States a better place to
live, rather than bickering over subjects that
the majority of the country has come to agree
upon. Rachel Maddow said it best on elec-
tion night, sayingthat if the Republican Party
continues to focus on outdated issues, "we
are all deprived, as a nation, of the construc-
tive debate between competing, feasible ideas
about real problems."

Last week, I read Ben Estes's
article, "Life after Football: the
Struggles after Playing Days Come
to an End." I spent the last five
months interviewing for an inspir-
ing story about turning challenge
into opportunity, on both an indi-
vidual and institutional level.
The story promised to highlight
the benefits of the M-PACT pro-
gram, which helps student athletes
transition into life after gradua-
tion, by providing a compassionate
and honest illustration of the career
challenges undergone by three for-
mer University football players
in the twelve years following our
National Championship victory in
1997.
I hoped the story would focus on
the lack of inclusiveness pervad-
ing the interaction between former
football players and the program we
gave so much to, and focus on sug-
gested avenues for bridging this gap.
To say I was disappointed would
be an understatement - but if you
want a story told right, you should
tell it yourself.
My story started in 1994. I was
an All-American running back from
Detroit's Cooley High School on an
athletic scholarship at the Universi-
ty, the second youngest of seven sib-
lings and the first of those seven to
attend college. Football was my top
priority; developing the life skills
to supersede a career-ending injury
was not. My career path would have
benefited from the existence of a
program like M-PACT and the pas-
sionate work of people like M-PACT
director Shari Acho.
I was a starting fullback for the
118th Big Ten and National Cham-
pionship football team of 1997 that
finished 12-0. Those of us who were
a part of that team still carry that
pride deep in our souls. But another
thing many of us have in common is
the feeling that the athletic depart-
ment we care so much about no lon-
ger cares for us.
This attitude of exclusivity hurts
everyone by precluding the ben-
eficial contributions we can make to
the program as former student ath-
letes with a wealth of experience,
talent and unique insights. Our
frustration over feeling excluded is

exacerbated by the difficulty many
of us have had transitioninginto our
professional careers as a result of
underdeveloped life skills.
In the article, Acho referred to
me as a "lost soul" and said that
stories like mine fuel her passion
for her work. If I was a lost soul, it's
because I was an 18-year-old kid liv-
ing a dream. And, because the most
persistent lesson our "leaders" ever
taught me was: "Your number one
mission is to win a Big Ten Champi-
onship and graduate." So I did both.
I support the M-PACT program.
But it must incorporate better sup-
port for inner-city and minority
student athletes, many of whom are
left feeling disillusioned by a uni-
versity with seemingly no regard
for how we'll get by when they're
done with us. Transitional services
should also extend to any student
athlete who studied here before
M-PACT's inception.
And for God's sake, please don't
call us names!
In 2002, I retired from the
NFL and came to work for Mike
Gittleson, Michigan's first direc-
tor of strength and conditioning. I
never intended to be a college foot-
ball trainer, but Gittleson knew
I'd work hard and he hoped I'd
find a second passion. In my four
years under Gittleson, I applied
for countless jobs in the athletic
department, but was told I needed
to further my education and diver-
sify my work experience to move
up in the program.
So I earned a master's degree,
worked for the NFL Players Asso-
ciation, the Detroit Lions, Wayne
State University Athletics, the Gfn-
eral Service Administration and
the Department of Defense, before
applying to be the assistant direc-
tor of alumni engagement this year.
The job was all but promised to me
during the months in which I left
my former job and moved back to
Ann Arbor. Perhaps I quit my job
prematurely, but I did so in good
faith, only to learn they gave the job
to someone else.
Finally, after 10 years of feeling
rejected by the athletic department
I've remained so loyally devoted
to, my frustrations gave way to an

inappropriate Twitter post that-
became the subject of much noto-
riety.
I regret my lapse in judgment,
but those wounded feelings remain.
I may not have been the most
qualified for this last role, but
surely, in 10 years an opportunity
must've existed for me to remain a
part of the program to which I've
given my all. Healing the discon-
nect many former student athletes
feel with the football program
beginsby institutionalizing a spirit
of empowerment and support for
those "lost souls" who need to feel
that this place is still our home.
Anyone who has played foot-
ball for the University knows that
if a coach or director makes you a
promise, his word is his bond. It
comprises the very fabric of the
program and the shared values that
produce men who form a brother-
hood from all walks of life:
1. Be on time.
2. Respect everyone.
3. No excuses.
4. Positive attitude.
5. Make a promise, keep it.
This, means showing respect to
those who helped to pave the way
and validating the bond of trust
between former athletes and the
program they remain committed to.
The program needs a more inclu-
sive and transparent hiring pro-
cess that expands post-graduation
avenues and repays the meaningful
contributions of its former athletes.
We also need a shared dedication to
life skills preparedness on the part
of coaches and student athletes
alike.
My message to current student
athletes comes frompast U.S. Presi-
dent Calvin Coolidge:
"Nothing in the world can take
the place of persistence. Persis-
tence and determination alone are
omnipotent."
. Students, be persistent in your
career planning and challenge the
status quo. The University has one
of the richest and most storied tra-
ditions of any university. But with
this power comes responsibility.
No M-PACT program can save our
"lost souls" if we just blindly follow
the "leaders."

BIG TEN
Frorrr Page lA
Maryland, along with Nebraska
joining the conference in 2010,
has expanded the Big Ten foot-
print 200 miles east and 300
miles west in the past two years.
There are significant finan-
cial bonuses in the deal for both
Rutgers and the Big Ten. Each
Big Ten university earned $24
million last year from The Big
Ten Network, the most lucrative
television network in college
athletics. With the addition of
the Scarlet Knights and Terra-
pins, the network will enter the
New York City and Washington,
D.C. markets, a move that ESPN
estimated Monday could bring
the conference and its member
schools up to $200 million in
extra revenue.
Delany, however, said the Big
Ten's desire to exploit the East
Coast market has been "a little
overplayed."
"The assessment by us was
really one that there had been a
paradigm shift in conferences,
and we were maybe slow to take
it up," Delany said. "We lived
with11members for 22 years, we
weren't necessarily seeing our-
selves at 14 or 16 members when

we added Penn State in 1990.
We weren't seeking the New
York market, we were seeking
a great institution located in an
adjacent state with a prosperous
academic and athletic approach.
It wasn't a TV play."
The relationship between
the Big Ten and Rutgers has
been an ongoing one, Delany
explained, with conversations
dating back several years. Per-
netti described the relationship
as "the perfect storm of rela-
tionships."
"Our job starting today at Rut-
gers is going to be to help create
new value for the Big Ten con-
ference," Pernetti said, "to bring
new things to the party that's
going to help further this confer-
ence as the greatest conference in
college sports."
The announcement culmi-
nates a quick climb for Rutgers
athletics, and particularly the
football program. Rutgers was
0-21 in the Big East from 2000-
02 before then-head coach Greg
Schiano lifted them to six bowl
appearances from 2005-11.
The Scarlet Knights are 9-26
all-time against Big Ten football
opponents and have never faced
Michigan. They also have the
designation as the first victor in
college football history - Rutgers

beat Princeton, 6-4, on Nov. 6,
1869 in the first-ever intercolle-
giate football game.
Rutgers joined the Big East in
1991 and it has won six Big East
team titles in that time - three
comingin baseball and one apiece
in women's basketball, men's soc-
cer and men's track and field.
Similar to Maryland, the Rut-
gers athletic department cut six
varsity sports - men's tennis,
men's lightweight crew, men's
heavyweight crew, men's swim-
ming and diving, men's and
women's fencing - in 2006. Per-
netti said the university intends
to focus on bolstering the 22 var-
sity team it still fields before look-
ing to reinstate any of the teams it
cut in the last decade.
The eventual progression
for the Big Ten appears to be
a 16-team conference, but for
today the conference is con-
tent to celebrate its most recent
addition.
"It's the perfect place for Rut-
gers," Pernetti said. "For athlet-
ics, the Big Ten conference is
the model, it's the ultimate. It's
ahead of the curve, and it's set
the bar in so many areas.
"For us it means stability in
an unstable time, it has secured
our future as an athletics pro-
gram and a university."

Intrinsic. The Journal reported
that people close to the, investi-
gation have identified Cohen as
"Portfolio Manager A."
Gilman - who served as safe-
ty monitoring chair for the tri-
als - is believed to have been
rewarded about $100,000 for
providing Martoma with infor-
mation, including detailed results
of the trial before the July 2009
public announcement. According
to the SEC, Martoma received
a $9.3-million bonus in 2008,
much of which can be attributed
to sales of Elan and Wyeth stock
allegedly prompted by Gilman's
information.
According to the SEC, Gilman
received about $79,000 from
Elan Coporation for his work on
the trials for the drug, Bapineu-
zumab.
Gilman was paired with Mar-
toma through an expert network
firm, which is a common occur-
rence for connecting investors
or consultants with industry
experts for analysis. The SEC
complaint does not name the
expert network firm, but Gil-
man's resume, posted on the
University of Michigan Health
System website, notes that he
held a consulting position with
Gerson Lehrman, among several
other firms, since 2002. The Wall
Street Journal reported Tuesday
that individuals familiar with
the case have confirmed that the
expert network firm used by Gil-
man and Martoma was Gerson
Lerhman.
GAME
From Page 1A
Swimming and Diving team also
helped facilitate the event.
University Regent Katherine
White (D-Ann Arbor), the event's
grand marshal, gave the opening
remarks. As a lieutenant. colonel
in the U.S. Army reserves and a
reserve instructor of law at the
United States Military Academy
at West Point, N.Y., she said she
feels a personal connection to
the veterans and to Wednesday's
game.
"We are here tonight to raise
awareness in our community
about those with disabilities and
to celebrate the veterans we have
within our community," White
said.
In addition to praising the vet-
erans, White took time to thank
the families and relatives of the
veterans, many of whom were in
attendance at the event.
"The demands placed on those
who serve in the armed forces
deeply affect family members and
most service members and vet-
erans could not accomplish what
they do without family support,"

The case notes that, after deal-
ing with Martoma through the
firm for several years, Gilman
saw him as a "friend and a pupil."
According to the SEC com-
plaint, Gilman scheduled his
consulting appointments with
Martoma around meetings of the
Safety Monitoring Committee
for the clinical trials, and would
share with Martoma what he
learned from the meetings.
Martoma was arrested by the
FBI and charged Tuesday with
conspiracy to commit securities
fraud and two counts of securi-
ties fraud. He was released on $5
million bail.
Gilman has entered a non-
prosecution agreement with the
SEC in which he has agreed to
settle the charges and cooperate
in this case and related investi-
gations in return for not being
criminally charged.
In the civil case, the SEC seeks
for the court to order Gilman and
the other defendants to desist
from the illegal activities, pay
civil monetary penalties and dis-
gorge all profits resulting from
the scheme. Gilman has already
agreed to pay $234,000 in set-
tling the case.
The SEC claims that the case
is the largest insider trading
case it has ever charged. Rob-
ert Khuzami, the director of
the SEC's Division of Enforce-
ment, said ina statement that the
actors involved took great risk in
engaging in illicit activities.
"Today's record-setting
insider trading case reinforces
the cold, hard lesson of so many
other recent cases that when
you trade on inside informa-
White said.
White also commented on the
positive impact that veterans con-
tinue to make on the University
community.
"It is your life experiences that
significantly broaden the per-
spectives of our campus commu-
nity," she said. "There are certain
things learned in military service
and experienced in military ser-
vice that are very difficult to learn
and experience anywhere else."
Teams for the event were com-
prised of student-veterans from
the University of Michigan and
Eastern Michigan University, as
well as veterans from the Washt-
enaw County Sheriff's Office.
Four official wheelchair team
players were also on each team.
While many of the veterans
competing actively embraced the
enjoyable nature of the event,
there was no lack of competitive
drive on either side. The Navy
Midshipmen looked to defend
their 2011 title, while the Army
Cadets looked for a repeat of their
2010 victory.
Navy scored the first points
of the game after rebounding off
a failed shot attempt, but Army
quickly evened the score with a
breakaway basket.

tion, you're not just betting your
money, but also your career, your
reputation, your financial secu-
rity and your liberty," Khuzami
said.
Law prof. Adam Pritchard
said information about clinical
trials is used in insider-trading
schemes frequently.
"The value of that sort of
information is potentially very
substantial," Pritchard said.
Pritchard said $276 million
is a very significant profit for an
insider-trading scheme.
"That is a lot of money, and
a lot of money for insider trad-
ing," Pritchard said, adding that
the stock exchanges and the
SEC often look for unusual, sub-
stantial trading prior to major
announcements.
Pritchard said it's not unusual
for the SEC to investigate a leak
of information prior to a public
announcement, but the use of
physicians or other experts as a
source seems to be a new trend
and new investigative priority
for the SEC.
"You'd more frequently see
somebody inside the company,
but the SEC has been looking
hard at some of these expert net-
works, and the line between the
experts providing expertise and
information can be a bit blurry,"
Prtichard said, referring to the
consulting firm through which
Gilman and Martoma met.
UMHS spokesman Pete Bar-
key declined to comment on the
case, citing an "ongoing federal
investigation."
Neither Gilman nor his law-
yer, Marc Mukasey, could be
reached Tuesday evening.
As time wore on in the first
period, both the pace and physi-
cality of the game increased, with
several more breakaway baskets,
including an early score by Scot
Severn, a U.S. Paralympic ath-
lete and former Army reservist at
Camp Graylingin Grayling Town-
ship, Mich.
The back-and-forth action lead
to a tied score of 8-8 at the end of
the first quarter. A pair of steals
and clutch baskets in the last 30
seconds of the half, however, gave
the Midshipmen an 18-14 lead.
Even and consistent play in the
third quarter brought the score to
24-21 in favor of the Midshipmen.
They controlled the remainder of
the game and won their second
second consecutive title with a
final score of 32-27.
Event organizer Gerald Hoff,
an insurance verification repre-
sentative for the University of
Michigan Health System, said the
event served as a means for the
University to support veterans,
both with and without disabili-
ties, and urged students to get to
know veterans at the University.
"The veterans that we have
here on our campus are second to
none," Hoff said. "They are ter-
rific young men and women."


FACULTY
From Page 1A
tees for executive officers and,
particularly, the search commit-
tee for the University's next pres-
ident, include representatives of
the Faculty Senate chosen from a
list of names selected by SACUA
and approved by Senate Assem-
bly," the resolution read.
According to Masten, the
recent search for the Universi-
ty's new general counsel, Timo-
thy Lynch, did not include any
non-administration faculty. The
resolution is meant to reaffirm
and reinforce the University's
tradition of including non-exec-
utive members of the faculty on
search committees for various
positions.
"Unlike the last time there
was a search for general counsel,
it didn't include any representa-
tives from the official faculty
bodies," Masten said. "This reso-
lution was just to encourage the
administration and the (Board of
Regents) to include those faculty
in the future."
Masten was cautious not
to criticize the actions of the
search committee and said the

focus of the resolution was sim-
ply to broaden the inclusiveness
of future search committees for
executive positions. He added
he didn't think the exclusion of
non-administration faculty was a
conscious decision by the admin-
istration, but that the resolu-
tion expressed faculty concerns
regardless.
"We think that generally the
administration probably wants
to have faculty opinions," Masten
said. "These are important posi-
tions, they will be interacting
with faculty while they're here
and the faculty have a long-term
interest inthe success of the Uni-
versity."
At the next SACUA meeting,
Masten said the group will meet
separately with University Pro-
vost Philip Hanlon and Coleman,
noting it is possible that the reso-
lution will be discussed with the
officials.
Kimberlee Kearfott, the
SACUA chair and an Engineering
professor, said the group's prima-
ry objective in passing the reso-
lution was to ensure faculty were
included inthe search committee
for the next University president,
but the motion fully extended
to search committees for other

executive officers as well.
Kearfott emphasized that the
resolution was not meant to rush
the selection process, praising
Coleman's tenure as University
president.
"(Coleman) is not a lame duck
president and has several initia-
tives that she's putting forward,"
Kearfott said. "It's not appropri-
ate for me to be speculating on
a search committee ... We have
an active president with a very
healthy relationship with faculty
governance."
Inclusion of students on
search committees for Universi-
ty executive officers was another
change that Kearfott said she
would personally like to see in
the future.
"I've had no one ever say (to
me) they were resistant to such
an idea," Kearfott said.
Both Masten and Kearfott said
they had not received a response
to the resolution from the Uni-
versity's administration. Kear-
fott said it is likely that the next
SACUA meeting will focus par-
tially on athletics, particularly
in light of the recent expansion
of the Big Ten conference to
include the University of Mary-
land and Rutgers University.

Pereira paves the path to America

By JEREMY SUMMITT
Daily Sports Writer
Nothing binds a country
together like the world's most
popular game. In Brazil, there's
hardly anything comparable to
22 athletes and a ball inside a sta-
dium - 90 minutes of emotional
bliss that can push away a per-
son's worries and urgencies with
the first tremendous strike on
goal.
Soccer has tied Michigan
junior midfielder Fabio Pereira
and his country together through
a prominent mutual bond. His dad
played, his brother nearly made it
professionally back home in Sao
Paulo and everyone else in Brazil
can easily relate to the experi-
ence that soccer brings to South
America's largest and most soc-
cer-crazed nation.
"Soccer is like a culture,"
Pereira said. "Even among the
lower classes you see people just
playing in the streets."
Pereira was no different - soc-
cer strengthened every connec-
tion in his life, from his family to
friends, and between his home
and another country.
Pereira has always been a step
ahead throughout his soccer
career - he's had a ball at his feet
ever since he could walk, and ulti-
mately he competed at the highest
youth levels with many of his bud-
dies back home. Pereira says his
fondest sports memories in Brazil
stem from the youth tournaments
that he participated in across the
world.
"In high school, I went with
this team in Brazil to play in the
Gothia Cup and we made it to the
finals," Pereira said. "It was really
cool for me to make it all the way
there."
The Gothia Cup is the largest
youth soccer tournament in the
world. More than 1,500 teams
from 72 countries competed last
year in the week-long event that
takes over Gothenburg, Sweden
every July.
On a global stage with over
52,000 people attending the
matches, it's easy to understand
why the experience was so pow-
erful for Pereira. You can label'the
experience an unforgettable one
for a student-athlete that every

Junior midfielder Fabio Pereira coses from Brazil, where soccer is king. He's brought that passion to Michigan.

himself in top fitness and his work
ethic is superb."
Pereira has received unending
praise from his coaches, but he's
always focused on getting better
and enjoys living in the moment.
Ann Arbor and Sao Paulo, partic-
ularly with respect to the sports
atmosphere, share some recog-
nizable differences that he can
fully embrace.
Michigan is just another stop
in Pereira's path, but possibly the
most impressive one, at least at
this stage of his career. Pereira
has always been ahead of his com-
petition, whether it's by crossing
up opponents with crafty foot-
work, succeeding in the class-
room or deciding to move to the
United States.
During the season, double
teams would flock to Pereira
in hopeless attempts to some-
how diminish his confidence on
the ball. Additionally, opposing
defenses have hardly salivated
at the bitter' taste of Pereira's
remarkable ability to place the
ball anywhere he wants, as he tal-
lied eight assists this year.
Pereira's journey from Brazil
to Connecticut to Michigan has
bridged a new path for some of
his friends from his youth team to
follow.
"From my friends, I was the
first one to come to America,"
Pereira said. "Now, two of them
play at Kentucky and one is at
Wake Forest."
Pereira's life has been directly
paralleled to numerous instances
of success and important connec-
tions. Like soccer has the ability
to unite an entire nation, Pereira
has fused a connection between
the United States and Brazil for
himself and his friends back home
to have a better chance at playing
professionally someday.
. At Michigan, Pereira is getting
a taste of what a professional foot-
baller, as most of South Ameri-
cans would say, feels like each
time he steps on the pitch. Until
he can entirely grasp the ecstasy
of playing at the highest level, the
always-rowdy Michigan Ultras
will have to take the place of true
soccer fanatics and the U-M Soc-
cer Complex can act as a sufficient
precursor for the next chapter of
Pereira's career.

Michigan soccer fan has grown
to love.
"My dad (got me started) when
I was like 3 years old," Periera
said. "(He) was huge in my deci-
sion to come here to the U.S."
Pereira came to the United
States just before his senior year
of high school, and for genuine
reasons that reiterated the true
meaning of the term student-ath-
lete.
"I always wanted to play pro-
fessionally," Pereira said. "I had
to drop out of school to play soc-
cer in Brazil and it was a very
risky choice. Here I can still get a
degree and pursue my future, and
then (still) get in the MLS draft,
hopefully."
His ambition landed him in
Connecticut, where he led South
Kent High School to a New Eng-
land Championship, en route to
winning all-state honors in his
first year in the United States.
Fabio continued to tally up more
remarkable accomplishments,
even in an extremely unfamiliar
environment.

Falcons
face off in
CCHA tilt
By MICHAEL LAURILA
Daily Sports Writer
It has been just five days since
the No. 19 Michigan hockey team
suffered its first sweep of the sea-
son at home against No. 6 Notre
Dame. And now Bowling Green
comes to town for a one-off mid-
week game with hopes of upset-
ting the struggling Wolverines.
Yost Ice Arena hasn't been nec-
essarily friendly this year to the
Wolverines, as Michigan (2-5-1

play.
Despite Michigan's struggles,
the Falcons (1-5-2, 2-8-3) seem
like the perfect team to allow the
Wolverines to snap a three-game
losingstreak spanning all the way
back to their loss against Michi-
gan State in East Lansing on Nov.
10. Bowling Green comes into
Wednesday's contest tied with
Northern Michigan for the worst
record in the conference.
"I'm sure (Bowling Green) is
a better team than their record,"
said Michigan coach Red Beren-
son. "I think we're trying to prove
we're a better team than our
record."
Berenson said that in any single
game, no team in the conference is
better than any other. But Michi-
gan holds statistical advantages
in both goals scored and goals
allowed over Bowling Green. The
Wolverines have 23 goals scored
and 29 goals allowed in confer-
ence play, compared the just 12
goals scored and 22 goals allowed
for the Falcons.
Despite these statistics, Michi-
gan has been inconsistent as of
late, and it holds just two more
points than Bowling Green in
the conference standings. A Wol-
verine loss on Wednesday would
position the Falcons ahead of
Michigan for ninth-place by alone
point.
Though Bowling Green has not
shown itself to be a powerhouse,
or even a threat, the Wolverines
can't let their guard down -
Berenson said they did just that
against Michigan State two weeks
ago, leading to an embarrassing
7-2 loss in East Lansing.
"You're always going to have
people that don't respect the
opponent and that's why there
are upsets," Berenson said. "It's
our job to get our team focused

on how we have to play. We can't
look at the opponent, we've got to
look at (us). We need to show up
and then we'll worry about the
opponent."
Inconsistency in the defensive
zone and in offensive produc-
tion have plagued Michigan dur-
ing its current losing streak. One
solution that Berenson used was
to mix up some of the lines, and
he said that this week the coach-
ing stuff has been making "subtle
changes" to getthe lines going yet
again.
How the short rest will affect
the Wolverines also remains to be
seen. After the loss to the Spar-
tans, Michigan had just five days
to prepare for the Fighting Irish -
resulting in a loss and the sweep.
Senior defenseman Lee Moffie,
who has experienced similar
games and series on shorter than
usual rest, said that this should
not play a major factor.
"The other teams deal with the
same thing, so it's kind of a two-
way thing," he said.
Either way, Bowling Green
appears to be the perfect team to
get Michigan back on track after
a difficult start to the season. But
Berenson knows that it won't just
be a weaker opponent that will set
the path right.

Rutgers University
joins the Big Ten

Senior quarterback Denard Robinson spent time at wingback, tailback, wide receiver and quarterback last weekend in his first game back from injury.
Robinson eys Borges s new

By ZACH HELFAND
Daily Sports Editor
For Michigan offensive coor-
dinator Al Borges, football is a
game of possibility. It's survey-
ing a field or scribbling plays on
a napkin, devising ways to get
two top-five NFL draft picks in
the same backfield, getting play-
makers in open space or to get
your playmaker the ball even if
he's injured. In his mind, there
are possibilities.
"My creative juices are flow-
ing all the time," Borges said..
"Depending on the game, I'm
considered creative or idiotic.
But they're always flowing."
Saturday was creative. Junior
Devin Gardner played most of
the game at quarterback against
Iowa, as he has for three weeks
now after senior quarterback
Denard Robinson injured his
elbow against Nebraska. Rob-
inson, the explosive playmaker,
often lined up in the backfield.
Robinson hasn't thrown a
pass since Michigan's game
against Nebraska on Oct. 27, but
the possibilities are still abound-
ing. There were new formations
and handoff options and a triple
reverse: loads of new possibili-
ties - some realized and some
theoretical - for which Ohio
State must prepare.
Michigan coach Brady Hoke
said Borges had already created
nine plays featuring Robinson

as a back before he was injured.
After Robinson's injury, Borges
drew up six more. Borges said he
devised some of the plays from
scratch, and others he tweaked
from existing offenses.
"When you coordinate an
offense for it seems like 100
years, you run a lot of plays at
one time or another," Borges
said.
"So consequently, there's a lot
of copy-cats and thievery. I've
had plays stolen from me, and
I've stolen plays from other guys
then tweaked plays to make
them hopefully fit with what
you're doing."
Michigan's new offensive
look, though exotic, isn't a
novel concept in college foot-
ball. Clemson featured plenty of
inverted wishbone - the same
formation Michigan uses for
its three-back look. The Green
Bay Packers featured the same
look two years ago in the play-
offs. Then, it was used to give
a power-offense look, not what
Michigan seeks to create with
its full-house set.
Louisiana-Monroe used
an even more unconventional
offense for one series against
Baylor earlier this year, using
two quarterbacks who each had
the option to pass. On one play,
one quarterback handed off to
the other, who then threw the
ball. Though Robinson has not
thrown with much zip in warm

ups for the past three weeks, the
possibility is there.
The idea of using playmak-
ers in unconventional roles isn't
new for Borges. As the offensive
coordinator at Auburn in 2004,
he coached Ronnie Brown and
Cadillac Williams, both top-five
NFL draft picks the following
spring.
He was handed the key to two
Ferraris, but he only had one
driver. Well, OK, one was actu-
ally a Cadillac, but he had to
figure out a way to utilize them
both at the same time.
"They're both tailbacks, you
know?" Borges said. "It didn't
seem like a fit, but if you could
do enough homework to figure
out how to get them both back
there, there were ways to do it."
And though Robinson didn't
throw on Saturday, Borges still
found him a way to get involved
- Robinson played in 20 of 62
offensive plays against Iowa.
He lined up as a tailback and a
wingback and a quarterback. He
touched the ball on 18 of those
plays.
Eight times, Robinson played
quarterback, though he only
went so far as to fake a pass
once. (He lined up as a quarter-
back one other time, but Michi-
gan called timeout before the
snap).
Another six times, Gardner
was under center flanked by
Robinson and two other backs.

He also lined up three times as a
tailback and three as a wingback
or receiver.
"There's so many different
things you can do with 11 guys,
it's like no other game," Borges
said. "That's what kind of makes
this game fun for coordinators."
And Borges had his fun. Early
in the game, Gardner handed
off to Robinson, who then ran
the option with redshirt junior
tailback Fitzgerald Toussaint.
Later, he used a triple reverse
to get Robinson into open space.
But Robinson may have been
more effective as a decoy. In the
full-house formation, Borges
called a throwback screen and
a misdirection pitch, each of
which set up touchdowns. And
with defenders creeping, Gard-
ner enjoyed his best passing per-
formance yet.
"When Denard had the ball,
he made big plays, but when
he didn't have the ball, we had
our even bigger plays," Gardner
said. "Just the attention he gets
is amazing."
The offense is still evolv-
ing, and Borges did not reveal
much at his press conference on
Tuesday, other than to say that
the tinkering has been fun. And
though the offense has been
designed in Borges's image, he
hasn't come up with a name that
is likely to stick.
"We call it, 'Denard in the
backfield,"' Borges said.

After days of rumors, Rutgers
confirmed Tuesday that it was
joining the Big Ten, becoming the
conference's 14th team only one
day after it was announced that
Maryland would also join the con-
ference.
Rutgers University president
Robert Barchi, athletic director
Tim Pernetti and Big Ten Com-
missioner Jim Delany announced
the move in a Tuesday afternoon
press conference. Rutgers' jump
from the Big East to the Big Ten
will likely mean an increase in
revenue as the school hopes to
capitalize on the conference's
lucrative television contract and
national stature.
After the Rutgers Board of
Governers faxed in its application
Tuesday morning to join the con-
ference, the Big Ten Council of
Presidents unanimously voted to
approve the Scarlet Knights. Rut-
gers, founded as Queen's College
in 1766, becomes the conference's
oldest university.
"The BigTen includes America's
most highly regarded academic
institutions, known for both their
athletic success and academic
achievement," Barchi said. "This
is exactly the right conference for
Rutgers. Our university is one of
the nation's leading research uni-
versities and our student-athletes
excel in the classroom and on the
playing field."
Barchi called it "a historic day
for Rutgers University." Pernetti
said it was "a transformative day."
"The Big Ten conference is the
ultimate academic neighborhood
to live in," Pernetti said. "And
we're not in that neighborhood,
with like-minded institutions,
peer schools. This is notjust about
collaborations on the field of play,
this is about a collaboration at
every level."
Though Maryland announced
it would join the Big Ten on July
1, 2014, an exit policy with the
Big East has handicapped Rut-
gers in determining a date to
join the conference. The Big East
requires 27 months' notice before
a team departs, though the Scar-
let Knights are in discussions to
negotiate a deal to leave earlier.
The additions of Rutgers and
Maryland, along with Nebraska
joining the conference in 2010,
has expanded the Big Ten foot-
print 200 miles east and 300
miles west in the past two years.
There are significant financial
bonuses in the deal for both Rut-
gers and the Big Ten. Each Big
Tenuniversity earned $24 million
last year from The Big Ten Net-
work, the most lucrative televi-
sion network in college athletics.

With the addition of the Scarlet
Knights and Terrapins, the net-
work will enter the New York
City and Washington, D.C. mar-
kets, a move that ESPN estimated
Monday could bring the confer-
ence and its member schools up
to $200 million in extra revenue.
Delany, however, said the Big
Ten's desire to exploit the East
Coast market has been "a little
overplayed."
"The assessment by us was
really one that there had been a
paradigm shift in conferences,
and we were maybe slow to take
it up," Delany said. "We lived
with 11 members for 22 years, we
weren't necessarily seeing our-
selves at 14 or 16 members when
we added Penn State in 1990. We
weren't seeking the New York
market, we were seeking a great
institution located in an adjacent
state with a prosperous academic
and athletic approach. It wasn't a
TV play."
The relationship between the
Big Ten and Rutgers has been an
ongoing one, Delany explained,
with conversations dating back
several years. Pernetti described
the relationship as "the perfect
storm of relationships."
"Our job starting today at Rut-
gers is going to be to help create
new value for the Big Ten con-
ference," Pernetti said, "to bring
new things to the party that's
going to help further this confer-
ence as the greatest conference in
college sports."
The announcement culminates
a quick climb for Rutgers athlet-
ics, and particularly the football
program. Rutgers was 0-21 in the
Big East from 2000-02 before
then-head coach Greg Schiano
lifted them to six bowl appear-
ances from 2005-1.
The Scarlet Knights are 9-26
all-time against Big Ten football
opponents and have never faced
Michigan. They also have the
.designation as the first victor in
college football history - Rutgers
beat Princeton, 6-4, on Nov. 6,
1869 in the first-ever intercolle-
giate football game.
Rutgers joined the Big East in
1991 and it has won six Big East
team titles in that time - three
coming in baseball and one apiece
in women's basketball, men's soc-
cer and men's track and field.
Similar to Maryland, the Rut-
gers athletic department cut six
varsity sports - men's tennis,
men's lightweight crew, men's
heavyweight crew, men's swim-
ming and diving, men's and
women's fencing - in 2006. Per-
netti said the university intends
to focus on bolstering the 22 var-
sity team it still fields before look-
ingto reinstate any ofthe teams it
cut in the last decade.

'M 'faces Pitt in NIT Tip-Off

By COLLEEN THOMAS.
DailySports Writer
Once upon a time, the National
Invitation Tournament was a
prestigious postseason tourna-
ment where
teams would vie P*
for the national 6
title - but that vs. Michigan
was before the Matchup:
NCAA Tourna- Pittsburgh 4-0;
ment and the Michigan 3-0
March Madness When:
that comes with Wednesday
it. 9:30 p.m.
Today, the Where: Madi-
postseason NIT son Square
is a consolation Garden
for, teams that TV/Radio:
don't make the ESPN2
NCAA Tour-
nament, but
its preseason counterpart has
become more esteemed.
The 2012 edition of the NIT
Season Tip-Off has No. 4 Michi-
gan as its heavy favorite, seeded
first of the 16 teams. After the
Wolverines dominated IUPUI
and Cleveland State in the first
and second rounds, they will
spend Thanksgiving weekend in
New York City.
Michigan (3-0) will play Pitts-
burgh in the semifinals of the
tournament Wednesday at Madi-
son Square Garden. The Garden
seems to be Pittburgh's home
away from home, as the Panthers

have amassed a 28-14 all-time
record in the arena. Michigan
junior guard Tim Hardaway, Jr.
admitted playing on such a big
stage can be a bit nerve-wracking.
"I'm kind of excited to go to
New York," Hardaway said.
"It's great, playing in Madison
Square Garden for the first time.
It's a blessing to have the oppor-
tunity to play in front of people
in New York, and the alumni out
there."
Led by head coach Jamie
Dixon, Pitt (4-0) returns 11 play-
ers and has added a few notable
freshmen. Forward Talib Zanna
and guard Tray Woodall head a
Panthers squad that is deep and
experienced, something that
Michigan coach John Beilein
knows is key to performing well
in a big-stage tournament this
early in the season.
Zanna is arguably Pitt's best
defender and is a rebounding
threat along with 7-foot fresh-
man center Steven Adams, the
preseason Big East Rookie of the
Year, who will be the tallest man
on the floor and can also rebound
well.
Junior guard Trey Zeigler,
who transfered from Central
Michigan during the offeseason,
brings an athletic, flexible body to
the Panthers lineup. The 6-foot-
5 guard caught the eye of Beilein
after Zeigler's father, Ernie, was
fired from his post as the Chippe-

was' head coach in March.
The one concern the Wolver-
ines may have with the Panthers
is their rebounding ability. Pitt
has four players listed at 6-f'oot-9
or taller, all of whom consistently
see the floor, while Michigan has
just three players on its entire
roster at that height. Rebound-
ing has always been a concern
under Beilein, but with the addi-
tion of freshman forward Mitch
McGary, rebounds have improved
so far this season.
And with the Wolverines play-
ingin Pantherterritory, this game
could provide an early test for the
youngsquad.
"I'm very proud of our team,
that we're in this situation, that
we're going to New York and play
on a national stage," Beilein said.
"Our kids are really excited about
it."
Added Hardaway: "It's defi-
nitely a huge honor, and it's great
not only for ourselves and our
team, but for Michigan. We work
hard, we get to show everybody .
what we're capable of and set an
example for the people coming in
next year."
The NIT Season Tip-Off is just
one of many notable tournaments
the Wolverines have participated
in - Michigan traveled to Hawaii
last year for the Maui Invitation-
al and just announced it will be
heading to south next year for the
Puerto Rico Tip-Off Tournament.

hough praising and
bashing the eats in Ann
Arbor is my customary
modus operandi, I'm shifting
course a bit this time around
in honor of
Turkey Day.
Join me as I
mix together
a few family
favorites, a
blue ribbon_
culinary
technique or NATHAN
two and some WOOD
real-deal tips
and tricks
that - served with a pinch of
sarcasm - will have you cook-
ing up the perfect Thanksgiving
dinner in no time. In this last
installment of my Thanksgiving
series, we're putting the finish-
ing touches on our spread so that
Thanksgiving 2012 will be one
to remember.
One of my fondest Thanks-
giving memories as a child is
making homemade butter with
my grandma. Of course, she had
a million other (probably more
pressing) things to do in order
to get turkey dinner on the
+* tabe but she somehow always
managed to pause for a few
minutes to help me whip cream
into butter. And unlike back in
the day, when a butter churn
was necessary, it really does
only take a few minutes.
Homemade Butter
Ingredients:
2 16-ounce cartons (2 pints)
heavy cream
/ teaspoon kosher salt
Directions:
Pour your heavy creaminto
an electric mixer or food pro-
cessor and beat on high speed
until the mixture curdles and
turns pale yellow. There should
also be a fair amount of sepa-
rated milky stuff in the bottom
of the bowl. These curdles will
soon be our butter and this
milky stuff is buttermilk! The
whole process takes approxi-
mately 10 minutes.
Using a mesh strainer and
some pressure from your palms,
separate the buttermilk from
the butter solids. Form the but-
ter solids into a ball and dry on
paper towel. Knead in the salt
and serve chilled, if desired.
And what could be easier to
make from scratch than butter?
Whipped cream! Plus, since
Uncle Jimmy is responsible
for bringing the pies this year,
those sure-to-be Meijer Bakery
specials could use a handcraft-
ed touch.
Homemade Whipped Cream
Ingredients:
116-ounce carton (1 pint)
heavy cream
1 teaspoon pure vanilla
extract
1 cup confectioner's ("pow-
dered") sugar
Directions:
Pop the beaters and bowl
of your electric mixer into the

freezer for 10 minutes. Upon
removing them, immediately
add all ingredients to the bowl
and begin whipping at high
speed. Continue until stiff
peaks form, meaning that when
you hold the beaters upside
down, the whipped cream
doesn't fall over like the top
of a soft-serve ice cream cone,
but instead stands resolutely.
Don't over-

beat, lest you want little butter
chunks in your whipped cream.
But no matter how deli-
cious your whipped cream is,
there are always those fam-
ily members who are going to
want to top their pies with ice
cream (guilty). If you're feel-
ing really adventurous, keep
with the theme and try making
your own. I just saw a recipe
for Brown Sugar-Bourbon Ice
Cream in Bon Appdtit's October
issue that I plan on making to
serve with my pecan pie this
Thanksgiving, though vanilla
bean would also be a delicious
addition to all sorts of after-
dinner treats. But if you're
looking to save time by going
store-bought, Hsagen-Dazs
offers the best alternative.
To wash down those pies and
our handcrafted toppings, keep
it simple by offering only regular
and decaffeinated coffees. Teas,
cappuccinos, flavored creamers
and dessert wines are all totally
unnecessary. In the same vein,
limit dinner drink offerings to
wine, iced water, milk and spar-
kling grape juice for the kiddies
(St. Julian's Sparkling Red is as
good as it gets). Soda, lemonade,
iced tea and other artificially
sweetened beverages are class-
less when served at the table.
Leave 'em for the other 364 days
of the year.
The true
meaning of
Thanksgiving.
So with our desserts and
drinks all wrapped up, the tur-
key we prepared and roasted
last week and the delicious
sides we've been making this
week, our Thanksgiving spread
is nearing completion. (I mean,
there is always the cranberry
relish and buttered corn, but
since I don't particularly enjoy
either of these things, I've pur-
posefully decided to overlook
them.) Shift the responsibility
of everything beyond these
turkey dinner mainstays to your
guests: One can bring the green
bean casserole, one the fruity
salad, one the Brussels sprouts,
one the mac and cheese, etc.
And don't forget t incorpo-
rate family classics. In my fam-
ily, this means Great-Grandma
Buit's dinner rolls, Grandma
Bowen's famous broccoli salad
with raisins and bacon and
Waldorf salad a la Grandma
"Duper" (the unfortunate
nickname my creative mind
assigned her and Gramps when
I was a kid ... long story).
Because that's all that really
matters anyway, isn't it? Deli-
cious food is definitely a plus,
but the Thanksgiving memo-
ries you'll cherish for the rest
of your life are eating Waldorf
salad with Grandpa and Grand-
ma Duper, laughing with Uncle
Jimmy about his Meijer pies,
remembering Great-Grandma
Buit over her dinner rolls, peel-
ing potatoes with Cousin Nata-
lie ("Bratalie") and taking time
to make homemade butter with

Grandma Bowen.
I think of Marcie's words in
"A Charlie Brown Thanksgiv-
ing": "Thanksgiving is more
than eating ... We should just
be thankful for being together."
Happy Thanksgiving, everyone!

musical, "A
Little Night Performance
Music," which NetworkTheatre

production of
all three with a twist of comedy.
As a renowned American com-
poser and lyricist, Sondheim is
known for bringing a contem-
porary New York setting to the
stage, but his take on "A Little

audiences to Scandinavia.
The winner of six Tony awards
and a Grammy, "A Little Night
Music" is set in Sweden in the
early 1900s and follows a series
of love triangles. When Fredrik
Egerman, a successful lawyer,
takes his trophy wife, Anne, to a
play one weekend, he unexpect-
edly meets his ex-lover, Desiree
Armfeldt, an alluring Swedish
actress. While the love between
the two is rekindled, Fredrik's
son, Henrik, falls in love with his
stepmother, further complicating
the situation. This chain of events
drives this collection of charac-
ters into a weekend of harmony
and discord.
"We have a brilliant cast,"
said Naz Edwards, a PNT associ-
ate artist who will play Desiree
Armfeldt. "It's amazing to see
the talent that we have here - all
from Detroit, Michigan. I think
that you will see it - I've never
seen such a strong vocal group
of people in a show here ever. So,

and gratetul tar who I'm working
with."
Opening its first act with the
song, "Remember?," "A Little
Night Music" is a triptych of
songs that are first sung indepen-
dently and subsequently braided
together both musically and the-
matically. As the lyrics begin to
overlap, so do the characters.
"The songs are a heavy exten-
sion of the dialogue," Edwards
said. "I think Sondheim has
incredible lyrics and music, with
a very definite tone, very - you
know - it's not the basic musi-
cal theater music. It's lyrics that
are smart because they are just
words that people speak. It's
like one leading into the other
- really beautiful, stunning
music."
Some of the other songs that
will be featured in the show
include "Send in the Clowns" and
"The Glamorous Life."
With Broadway music and a
cast that includes Tony, Grammy,.

winners and Pulitzer-Prize win-
ning authors, PNT hopes to pro-
vide Ann Arbor audiences with,
an experience that speaks to a
wide range of audiences through
its production of "A Little Night
Music."
"Oh, I think it's a classical for
everybody. I think its sophistica-
tion is itself comprehendible for
all ages and it's just fun for every-
body," Edwards said. "It crosses
over, too, I would say, to people
who like opera - light Opera,
because there's a lot of sophisti-
cated vocal sounds in the music
like there are in the pop music of
today."
She added: "(Sondheim's) lyr-
ics are brilliant, the music is
great. There's nothing like it. It's
a very different journey when
you go see a piece of his. For me,
it makes me think so much and
feel so much as a performer. It's
not fluffy and light. It's just so
incredible. It's very deep, and
thoughtful and real - very real."

or South America, the first time the Botanical Gar-

dens has hosted an event this
time of year in the holiday spirit,
citing a past theme of sustainable
Christmas decorations.
Through the years, a special
guest has been making an appear-
ance for the kids as well.
"We've always done kids class-
es, and Father Christmas has
become a tradition," said David
Betz, the garden's visitor opera-
tions manager. "We've had dif-
ferent activities that have been
more related to either a craft or
an activity in the conservatory or
a speaker or a lecture related to
the exhibit."
Betz oversees the educative
aspects of the event, as well as
the creation of the overall look.
One of the staples of the Botani-
cal Gardens holiday events is the
Poinsettia Tree, made entirely of
Poinsettia plants.
"It's always a big draw and a
great photo opportunity," Betz
said. "And there will be different
colors of poinsettias depending
on what (green) house you are in.
There's a big focus on holiday col-
ors to complement the interpre-
tation of the feast and the plants
and food that are celebrated."
This year, however, is the first
time the Botanical Garden will be
hosting a culinary feast.
"We're working with the U
of M chefs, and they've created
a menu using ingredients that

could be found in the conserva-
tory," Betz said. "Every entree,
every appetizer, even our mock-
tail has an ingredient that can be
found in the conservatory."
In an interactive way, the world
dinner party sets the theme of the
exhibit.
"It's about reallyhelpingpeople
make that connection between
vanilla orchid and the vanilla fla-
voring and the vanilla they expe-
rience in foods," Betz said. "Orthe
chocolate and how it becomes the
chocolate we know and use and
how other cultures use them."
He added: "Some ancient cul-
tures are showcased and how
they use these plants as well as
some current cultural celebra-
tion."
The dinner takes place on Dec.
14 at 6 p.m. and will include a pre-
dinner tour of the exhibit as well
as a chef's cooking demonstration.
"We would love to see how (the
dinner) is received," Betz said. "It
would be great to have something
in the conservatory, like around
Valentine's Day, that can play off
this idea to make a connection
between plants and foods, and
really just enjoying the space this
way."
"Really, during this time of
year when we all are thinking of
food, we can create environmen-
tal awareness of relationships of
food supply," Grese said.

You will rarely be as succesful in achieving your goal standard of living as
you will be during college. Enjoy.
-Scott'82, regarding "The snacker generation"

The day after Thanksgiving is one
of my favorite days of the year. Not
because of Black Friday, but because
of the commercials. My cousins and broth-
er and I eat leftovers all day, lounge on the
orange shag carpet in my Grandma's base-
ment and watch the first Christmas movie
of the season.
If we're lucky, it's "Home Alone." If ABC
decides to show a different family holiday
flick, we have back up and pull out our own
collector's edition of the Macaulay Culkin
classic.
But it's way better to watch on TV.
Because the commercials on Black Friday
are just as good as the movie. It's the first
day of the season, and advertisers are in
fine form. They can finally use all of the
great Santa-and-his-elves material they've
been working on all year.
There's that one animated commercial
where a poor little elf is sitting in his cabin
on top of a snowy mountain. He has a ter-
rible cold and can't help Santa build toys.
His nose is so raw it looks like Rudolph's.
Remember that one? The voiceover rhymes
in couplets about how sad the elf is to stay

in bed - until someone brings him Puffs
Plus with Lotion! The elf uses one of the
tissues, the redness goes away and he is
instantly happier.
I won't be offended if you don't remem-
ber it.
Advertisers love me. Slogans and jingles
by celebrities meant to sell me something
usually succeed. They convince me' that
there's a 100-percent chance my life will
get better if I buy whatever they're trying
to sell.
Once there was this ad for toothpaste that
was so cool and minty fresh that your mouth
would feel as icy and clean as the snow of an
avalanche rushing down the side of a moun-
tain. It had these little breath strips in it that
exploded to reveal a girl with radiant white
teeth skiing down the mountain, narrowly
escaping the wall of snow crashing down
behind her.
I buy that toothpaste.
I also buy shampoo that claims it will
make my hair smoother and shinier. You
know those commercials where they zoom
in on animated hair follicles and show how
each and every rough strand of hair is silky

after using whatever kind of hair condition-
er they're selling? I think I'm doing that to
my hair almost every time I shower. Some-
times I disgust myself.
As you can imagine, terror strikes at
Starbucks. Those seasonal beverages get
me every time. Pumpkin spice lattes dictate
when fall begins, and the arrival of pepper-
mint mochas mark the beginning of my holi-
day festivities.
I'm painfully aware of how susceptible
I am to corporate persuasion. One of my
majors is communications.
Once, my professor showed us two dif-
ferent commercials for bleach. One of the
commercials featured a black family, and
the other a white family. Then she asked us
which one made us want to buy the bleach.
I raised my hand and said the one with the
black family. The professor then informed
us that the majority of those who watched
that version of the ad shared my opinion.
According to the studies we later looked at,
white clothing looks cleaner and brighter on
darker skin, so the company chose to use the
ad featuring the African American family.
'Time after-time, class after class, I con-

tinued to find myself falling in line with the
what "the majority of Americans are influ-
enced by."
Even though I'm learning about all the
different ways advertisers try to appeal ,W
consumers, I still fall for it. I know drink-
ing Diet Coke won't make everything in my
hectic life fall into place, but I still buy one
when I'm stressed out. If I have a cold and
my nose is red, I rush to CVS and buy a box
of Puffs Plus with Lotion and immediately
believe the redness will dissipate. I know
what these marketing schemes are trying to
do, and I let them have their way with me
completely.
I may be an exaggerated case study, but
everybody is influencedby advertising some-
how. It just depends on how much you give
in to them. It takes a strong person to pass
by a Starbucks while warm cinnamon swirls
and pumpkin leaves adorn the windows.
All I'm saying is that you should give in
sometimes. Buy a Diet Coke and watch as
your life gets better.

to work at the Michigan League, though his
schedule varies in shift times, length and
location.
"(Before college) I was more of a morn-
ing person, but I'm kind of anything now,"
Broughman said.
His earliest class is at 9 a.m., and though
the latest he tends to get off work is 2 a.m.,
once a month each building manager pulls
an all-nighter to monitor the door to the
Inn at the League, the hotel in the League.
Broughman said the first few hours aren't
bad, but it can become a battle to stay
awake as the night wears on. However, he
claims to not be burdened by sleep debt.
"If I can sleep in just one day after, I'll be
fine," Broughman said.
Broughman added that he's used to a var-
ied weekly schedule since he started work-
ing in the Unions freshman year and has
m worked as a building manager for more than
a year. He's taking 16 credits, and though he
said academics come first, his job can get in
the way.
"There are times when it's kind of hectic,"
Broughman said. "I'm looking forward to
Thanksgiving break."
Linton said her work can be "frustrating"
and "physically exhausting," so she's only
taking 10 credits this semester and plans on
taking 11 credits winter term.
Sleep habits account for the largest
amount of discrepancy in the grade point
averages of college students, according to
a 2000 study published in the Journal of
American College Health. Later wake-up
times were most closely tied with lower
grades.
This is a study I can relate to. I had to take
two Incompletes in classes last semester, and
the largest contributing factor was the per-
sistent sleep problems I encountered that
made attendance difficult.
The study also claims low grades are very
closely associated with a high number of
paid or volunteer work hours per week.
This semester, I'm juggling 12 credit

hours along with three part-time jobs -
one of which is in the restaurant industry.
The effects of this schedule on my GPA
remain to be seen, but for me, the only ben-
efit of a predisposition to getting less sleep
is more waking time to work and socialize.
Linton said despite working about 35
hours a week, she still manages to get
adequate sleep most nights. Her earliest
class starts at 1 p.m., and she seldom has
to wake up before 10:30 a.m. For Linton,
working nights is worth sacrificing social
opportunities and altering her sleep
schedule.
"I'm taking out loans, and my parents are
very willing to help, but I'd rather make my

own spending money," she said.
Miles to go before I sleep
For others, staying up isn't a choice - it's a
part of who they are.
Jonathan Poczatek doesn't have a sleep
schedule. When we met at a coffee shop on
a Friday afternoon, he exclaimed that he
woke up at 8 a.m. for the first time in a long
while.
The LSA sophomore's earliest class is at
4:00 p.m. on Tuesdays and Thursdays. While
sports and after-school activities kept him in
check in high school, Poczatek has become
accustomed to an adaptive, and at times
sleepless, schedule in college.
"In college, I can go all the way around the
clock," Poczatek said.
Poczatek was on a prescription for
Adderall, an amphetamine oftentimes pre-
scribed by physicians to treat attention def-
icit hyperactivity disorder, but he recently
stopped taking the medication because the
added benefit of increased concentration
didn't outweigh the downsides of crashing
and having to increase dosage for effective-
ness.
"It's-really just speed," Poczatek said.
Poczatek said it's "obvious" when stu-
dents are abusing amphetamines to focus in
class and -in the library, but he's not willing
to trade off sleep and well-being for the cor-
rective powers of Adderall and medications
of its kind.
I've tried several sleep aids, which have
worked to varying degrees, but, like Poc-
zatek's experience with prescription medi-

cation, the benefits weren't worth the side
effects.
Poczatek said a full night's sleep is rare.
Instead he operates on two-to-six hour
naps and he hardly ever feels tired. He
said he's tried cutting down on caffeine
and altering his schedule in the past, but
he's never slept much. He added that his
mother understands because she's always
been the same way, and his housemates are
getting used to his almost constant wake-
fulness.
Even without the Adderall prescription,
Poczatek sometimes stays up all night to
participate in Hack-A-Thons or just play
video games with friends. He hopes to
transfer into the College of Engineering to
pursue computer science next year. Pocza-
tek said the life of a programmer - where-
in work can be done from home, at any
time, as long as its completed by a deadline
- appeals to his night owl preferences.
Poczatek told me his new espresso
machine is the "best thing ever," and he said
he'll use it frequently to stay alert as course-
work picks up near the end of the semester
and to play a new video game. He said losing
out on sleep will be compromising, but worth
it.
"I'm not going to feel like a person for -a
while," Poczatek said.
There are times when I feel more like
a creature of the night than a person, but
there's no better place than college to find
fellow creatures. They're studying in the
UGLi until dawn. They're sweeping up the
bottles dropped at the bar. They're online,
asking, "you up?"

udgjernent-

' ris k o f e
disease
Obsity

y the time I started counting how
many probes were attached to my
head and body, I was too tired to
complete the task. I stopped at 28 and tried
to settle into a comfortable position in the
railed, hospital twin bed. Dawn, my ironi-
cally named night shift nurse at the KMS
Sleep Center near Briarwood Mall, spoke to
me over the intercom.
"State your name for the video record,"
she ordered. Saying my name to a disem-
bodied voice while hooked up to probes in
a dark room is on the short list of creepiest
things I've ever had to do, but it had to be
done.
I'd been waiting to participate in a
sleep study for more than six months. I
was hoping to get diagnosed and figure
out a better treatment plan for the sleep
problems I was facing - sleep paralysis
and insomnia.
But even after spending 18 hours in a
10x12 room with probes stuck to my head,
the data was inconclusive. For many college
students like me, sleep is still an elusive end
to a long day.
Some of us pull all-nighters to cram for an
exam, some of us stay up until dawn drink-
ing, but some of us have more reasons than
others to brave the moonlight.
One well acquainted with the
night
Fourth-year Medical student Eliza-
beth Chenoweth has learned to sleep
whenever she can. During her third year,

Chenoweth often had to work demanding
hours - once staying at the hospital for 25
hours straight because of scheduling con-
flicts during her Obstetrics and Gynecol-
ogy training.
_ Fourth-year Medical stgdent Scott DeRoo
said The Accreditation Council on Gradu-
ate Medical Education enforces an 80-hour
per week work limit for trainees, but before
these new regulations, he often worked
30-hour shifts.
"You do it because that's what you need
to do," DeRoo said. "But in some ways, it's
actually a shame that things have changed
because good learning goes on at night."
Chenoweth said the ACGME has since
altered regulations to cap the shift times for
trainees at 16 hours, but the training is still
taxing.
"Depending on what rotation you're on,
you can be working many, many hours or
you could be having a pretty light rotation,"
Chenoweth said. "But you still have to take
exams and quizzes on top of that."
Chenoweth said the first and second years
of medical school are similar to the under-
graduate years because students only have to
be concerned with academic responsibilities.
Though all-nighters are common, total sleep
hours are unaltered.
"You might be up late cramming one
night, but then you can make up for it later
on," Chenoweth said.
College students tend to accrue sleep
debt - the difference between the doctor-
recommended amount of sleep you should
be getting and how much you actually get.

sup i

And like regular debt, sleep debt can't usu-
ally be "paid off" in one lump sum of a nap,
according to a 2008 article in Scientific
American. The only wpy to make up for lost
sleep, according to the article, is to slowly
increase how much you sleep per night -
an unthinkable lifestyle change for many
stressed students.
The third and fourth years of medical
school, which are meant to prepare for the
rigors of residency, involve much more sleep
debt. Chenoweth and DeRoo currently have
two months off to apply and interview for
residencies, which is why they could meet
me at a coffee shop to talk last Sunday.
Meanwhile, the third-year medical students
I e-mailed last week still haven't gotten back
to me.
Among the hardships of a restless sched-
ule is illness, an inconvenience Chenoweth
said her superiors in the health field under-
stand. However, it's difficult for interns to
take sick time off becase they don't want to
fall behind.
"Sometimes it's really hard to be healthy,"
Chenoweth said.
Sleep is often cited as a top determiner of
overall health - physical and mental, long-
