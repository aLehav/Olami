FINE ARTS NOTEBOOK
Carving art into the Olympics

Modern art seeks to
redefine competitive
influences
By JONATHAN ODDEN
Daily Arts Writer
With the London Olympics fast
approaching, it's high time the art
community gears up for another
celebration of all things artistic. Or,
at least, that was the case a century
ago.
It's hard now to imagine art's
place at the Olympic games, espe-
cially considering the Wolff Olins
2012 logo that has outraged many,
given seizures to some and has
even been seen as racist by the
Iranian government. Yet, a hun-
dred years ago, art was actually
a competitive event at the 1912
Stockholm games.
Pierre de Coubertin, the inno-
vator and posthumously criticized
founder of the International Olym-
pic Committee, believed that the
games needed a synthesis of athlet-

is and intellectual pursuits to round
out the competition. He drew this
viewpoint from his interpretation
of the Greek games - where sport
and culture seemed interwoven -
and from his personal educational
philosophy - which sought to cre-
ate a more complete individual
through learning and sport.
So a system was designed in
which art, or rather artists' tech-
niques, would be split into five
judged categories: architecture,
literature, music, painting and
sculpture. Within each category,
the judges would award honors of
gold, silver and bronze medals just
as they would in any other Olym-
pic competition. This format was
followed in the Olympic games for
the next forty years, until it was
decided by the IOC that artists
were professionals and the com-
petition was discretely dropped
after the Helsinki summer games
in 1952.
The competition did draw
some unusual artists to the Olym-
pics, such as American Walter
W. Winans', who won the gold

medal for his bronze sculpture,
An American Trotter, in 1912.
Interestingly, this was not Winans
first Olympic medal, but his third.
He also received the gold for his
shooting skills in rifling during
the 1908 London games and the
silver in 1912.
That same year, Pierre de Cou-
bertin won the gold medal for liter-
ature with his poem "Ode to Sport."
Perhaps Coubertin's victory reflects
his own ego and desire to recede
amid the Olympiads, but maybe it
was an outcome of necessity, since
no other artist rose to challenge
him in the event. In fact, across all
five events of the Stockholm games,
just six artists participated, mak-
ing it a competition in name only.
The sole silver medalist that year,
French sculptor Georges Dubois, is
unfortunately all but lost to history
now.
Yet the year 1912 was far from
lacking in artistic flair. Cubism had
thrown the art world into the avant-
garde of modernism, and futurism
emerged, heraldingthe triumphs of
modernity. However, neither move-

ment, nor their peripheral imper-
sonators and reactionaries, were in
Sweden that summer. The pieces
winning the Gold were traditional,
formulaic and - as with winner
Giovanni Pellegrini's gold medal
painting - genuinely cartoonish.
Clearly, something was institution-
ally wrong.
The problem may come from
the "amateur" status that the com-
petition required, since most seri-
ous artists then and now dedicate
themselves to their work, not com-
petition - see if you get very far
calling Christo and Jeanne-Claude
or Murakami an amateur. Even still,
the labels of "amateur" and "profes-
sional" are more slippery in regards
to art than in sports. So, if we just
sidestep that issue, can we find an
intersection between the Olym-
pic games, competition and the art
world?
Some say no, suggesting that art
and competition is like water and
oil, but such a notion is misguided
when looking at the increasingly
competitive art world. Perhaps now
art is even more competitive than

the sports world when you con-
sider the percentage of highly paid
artists to highly paid athletes or
the critical reception they receive
- Nobel Prizes in literature, poet
laureates and so on. Art exhibitions
are now corporate sponsored and
museums are more and more pre-
occupied with admission. And this
competition isn't solely at the high-
est echelons of the art world, since
scholarships for art, essays and
design are as numerous and com-
parative as athletic scholarships.
Though the art world may not like
to acknowledge it, valuation is rife
within its ranks.
Why shouldn't we see a Prisma-
color sponsored artist someday?
It might already exist, consider-
ing that national funds constant-
ly support artists they believe
support their ethos - think Lee
Ufan's Guggenheim show last fall
that was sponsored by Samsung.
We may very well be on the verge
of art returning to the Olympics,
but hopefully not at the expense of
the unknown artists that push the
art world forward.

and Feker and assisted by "The biggest angle on our menu

is that we're only serving food that
betters you," Morse said. "By eat-
ing it, the cauliflower will help you
think clearer, the kale chips will
help build your body, the pome-
granate will improve your mood,
and it's all these different compo-
nents that improve the way you
live."
In addition to the health ben-
efits of these foods, The Beet Box
will also be sourcing all their
foods locally, through either the
Ann Arbor Food Co-op or the Ann
Arbor Farmer's Market, which has
become an increasingly popular
trend due to the benefits of sus-
taining the local economy and the
added nutritional benefits of fresh
produce free of preservatives.
Both of these benefits tie into the
philosophy behind The Beet Box,
where the health food initiative,
already a strong theme in the Ann

Arbor community, is only one part
of the revolutionary whole.
"I thinkthat(sourcinglocal food)
also ties into our greater concept,"
Morse said. "Beinga restaurant that
not only serves the community, but
completely engages and creates the
community."
To do this, The Beet Box syn-
thesizes the approaches to the
individual and the community.
Along with the benefits of sustain-
ing the local economy through
local produce, The Beet Box also
plans to create an alliance of local
health causes and health-promot-
ing non-profits by donating a por-
tion of the price of each meal to
these organizations.
"We declare that our mis-
sion is empowering people to be
healthy," Morse said. "And every
single business or non-profit in
the community becomes our part-

ner because they agree with that
mission."
Another edification of this alli-
ance and its resulting commu-
nity is a twist on an old formula:
Instead of giving a recurring cus-
tomer a free meal after so many
purchases, they'll receive a free
pass to a yoga or dance class with-
in the community.
"We're transforming the rela-
tion between the person behind
the counter and you," Morse said.
"You're giving them channels to
be healthy, and you're giving them
influence to be healthy."
The Beet Box is a place where
students can not only eat a quick,
healthy meal to the sweet sounds
of Motown, but also meet others
with a similar passion and togeth-
er join this vertex to a commu-
nity founded on the celebration of
health and empowerment.

As someone who really likes
video games, I can saythat I was not
alone in being completely under-
whelmed by the launch of Sony's
handheld powerhouse, PlayStation
Vita. A little more than a month
after its release, the PS Vita has yet
to make a significant splash.
Yet, the PlayStation Vita is a
sweet piece of hardware. Even the
most jaded of nerds aren't left indif-
ferent by the specs: two on-board
quad-core processors, a five-inch
touchscreen, two analog sticks (one
more than its previous iteration, the
PlayStation Portable) and your stan-
dard d-pad and array of four Play-
station buttons, among others. For
those not versed in gaming lingo,
the PlayStation Vita is a stacked
handheld portable gaming platform
that is more than capable of housing
high-end single- and multi-player
content. So why hasn't anything
significant happened in the last five
weeks?
For one, portable gaming has
(mostly) been relegated to iPhones/
Androids and their respective apps.
People have started to move away
from hours spent playing Pokdmon,
opting for that 30-second reprieve

offered by a round of "Draw Some-
thing" or the quick satisfaction of
smashing pigs into oblivion, a la
"Angry Birds."
While the casual gaming mar-
ket has expanded many-fold with
the advent of smartphones, more
hardcore thrill-seekers can find
refuge in some of the higher-end
games available for their iPhones/
Androids without having to carry
around a second item. "Infinity
Blade," for example, is a game with
respectable graphics and immersive
gameplay available on the iPhone
that received a great bit of praise for
its use of the available hardware.
Additionally, the PS Vita is falling
into the same traps as its predeces-
sor. The PlayStation Portable never
lived up to expectations despite
a series of good releases and re-
releases, as well as the massive
success of the "Monster Hunter"
series. The Nintendo DS and 3DS,
comparatively, acquired a large
portion of the casual gaming mar-
ket through adorable gimmicks
like "Nintendogs" and the release
of quality content. Nintendo's 3DS
has been smashing the PlayStation
Vita's sales almost every week since
its release.
The quality of content being
released on traditional consoles

PlayStation Vita not up to par

(PC, Xbox 360, PS3) is so much
higher than what's available on the
Vita - which is admittedly very
high-end, especially when com-
pared to previous capabilities of
past handheld platforms, but it isn't
necessarilyworth the investment to
someone who has access to the mil-
lions of fun, low-intensity games on
smartphones.
Vita can't beat
'Nintendogs'
Through Vita, Sony appeared
to be attempting to appeal to the
small niche of gamers who are
excited enough about high-end
hardware to buy a PlayStation
Vita, but who don't own a smart-
phone. The biggest issue with
this strategy lies with the Vita's
current library. It's essentially a
string of small-name games with
no distinctive draws to make them
stand out. In other words, (mostly)
underwhelming rehashes, includ-
ing a game with "Okami"-style
painting mechanics that becomes
cumbersome and boring, a poor

NA MCO R AN DAI

The Powerpuff girl's hotline must be ringing off the hook.

"Ridge Racer" port, an average
"Katamari" release with the exact
same gameplay as the last few,
the umpteenth iteration of Major
League Baseball games and a
high-quality Playstation 3 port of

Looking over all the popu-
lar and soon to be released 3DS
games, we have a ton of cutesy
games that do everything but
promise an intense gaming experi-

don't sound as enticing as "Ridge

but they appeal to a larger group
of individuals who probably won't
care so much about how terrible
the games are.
Sony's PlayStation Vita
attempts to fill a niche that's too
small with a library that's too dull
while going against some tough
competition. It's an awesome sys-
tem that lacks the support and
demand needed for serious suc-
cess, and until the Vita gets its
own set of high-octane releases,

Avengers revamps tired genre

Whedon's script to
breathe new life into
comic book heroes
By KAYLA UPADHYAYA
Senior Arts Editor
An unofficial leader of the nerd
realm, Joss Whedon has estab-
lished himself as a prolific and
venerated screenwriter on tele-
vision with the dynamic duo of
"Buffy the Vampire Slayer" and
"Angel" - as well as the short-
lived but ever-loved "Firefly" -
and on the big screen with cult
favorite "Serenity" and the more
recent, self-aware "Cabin in the
Woods." It's fitting that a man
with the super skills of Whedon
has stepped up to write and direct
Marvel's "The Avengers," the
much-anticipated culmination of
four years of box-office-exploding
Marvel superhero movies.
In a recent conference call in
which The Michigan Daily par-
ticipated, Whedon explained that
this is not the first time he has had
to work with pre-existing charac-
ters and stories, as he worked on
an "X-Men" movie and wrote one
of the "Alien" installments.
"Even on a TV show, even if
you're the one who established
them every time you write a
script, you're dealing with an
established universe," Whedon
said. "So it's not hard for me to fall
into the cadences of these people.
In fact, it's a lot easier when you've
already seen them being acted in
the other movies."
In "The Avengers," S.H.I.E.L.D.
director Nick Fury (Samuel L.
Jackson, "Pulp Fiction") has to
bring together a bunch of heroes
who all have superhuman pow-
ers and superhuman egos. Having
to direct a cast made of a slew of
acclaimed and talented actors,
Whedon's job as director was sim-
ilar.
"I felt very much like Nick
Fury," Whedon said. "He's the
director of S.H.I.E.L.D., literally,
and that puts him at a remove from
everybody, even if he likes them
... I'm not nearly as intelligent or
manipulative as Nick, and I didn't
have as many problems because
my actors actually wanted to be
together. They enjoy each other."
Whedon explained that he dif-

fers from Nick because he never -
at least he hopes - put his actors in
harm's way as Nick has to do with
his team.
"You do feel that responsibility
that you've gotta get all of these
people to give their best," Whedon
said. "You know, for him it's in bat-
tle and for me it's when we're roll-
ing to really, you know, come up
with their best stuff and play off
each other as well as possible. And
you have a great responsibility to
service them with your camera at
the same time. So I definitely felt
some of the pressure, but I can see
out of my left eye."
Because the film had such a
large cast, Whedon noted that
unfortunately not every pairing
got screen-time. He had difficulty
choosing a favorite combination of
characters.
"I love the Bruce Banner-Tony
Stark relationship," Whedon
explained. "Bruce Banner's the
first guy Tony Stark's come across
really who operates on his level
intellectually, who isn't a villain.
... Tony's particular attitude about
the Hulk is endearing and cool.
But I also love Tony and Steve and
how much they can't stand each
other. And I'm very invested in
Natasha and Hawkeye and their
deep, deep friendship, so ... oh, I
love them all."
In explaining how he became
attached to the project, Whedon
said he has known Marvel Studios
President Kevin Feige for a while
and has been reading comics for
even longer.
"I think Marvel has a great nose
for a director who has a passionate
vision, who's not famous for turn-
ing out big-budget hits, but will
bring something a little bit fresh
to the concept of a hero movie, and
it's one of the things that I respect
the most about them ... it just
seemed like a good fit," he said.
Though the characters and cast
will be familiar to moviegoers,
Whedon said his directorial style
is distinct and that his film won't
necessarily look like the other
Marvel movies that preceded it.
"There's no way you could make
a movie that looked like a Jon
Favreau, Kenneth Branagh, Joe
Johnston, Louis Leterrier movie,"
Whedon said. "I do think, you
know, the DNA of the Marvel movie
begins with 'Iron Man,' and that's

very grounded in the real. I tend to
be a tiny bit florid with my camera
work and my dialogue, but hopeful-
ly in a way that feels like a realistic
version of a comic book universe."
The more sci-fi and fantasy ele-
ments of "The Avengers" were
what drew Whedon - who has
incorporated everything from
vampires, to space cowboys, to
all-powerful evil gods in his past
work - to the story.
"Marvel was known for it's gritty
realism, and 'Spider Man' was sort
the template for 'oh, they could just
be people in New York,' " Whedon
explained. "And even though the
Avengers made their home in New
York, they were so often out in
that space and dealing with artifi-
cial intelligence, and grand beings
from another world, and gods and
monsters. And I love that element.
That's definitely a part of the film."
Whedon described the writing
process for the film as very organic.
For him, when writing a script, fig-.
uring out how things are going to

look and feel are just as importantas
the actual dialogue. Because he and
his crew were working on a tight
schedule, some of the set pieces and
action sequences had to be worked
on before the story was-put to paper.
This made it difficult to piece it all
together, but he again emphasized
the organic- and teamwork-based
nature of the process.
With dozens of larger-than-life
action films hitting the box office
this summer, Whedon explained
that he hopes his movie is a bit
more reminiscent of what summer
movies used to represent.
"I think 'The Avengers' is the
kind of movie that I grew up want-
ing to make and thought they had
stopped making," Whedon said.
"When I grew up, the summer
movie was literally created as a con-
cept, and all my life I wanted to do
something like that, something like
the first 'Indiana Jones,' something
that was steeped in character, in
love of the genre that it was por-
traying, had intelligence, had real

MARVEL
acting, had a story that unfolded
and wasn't just a sort of big premise
that you already knew going in - or
isn't based on, you know, Parcheesi
or something just because it has a
name."
About more recent summer
flicks that are more about the
spectacle than the story, Whedon
is critical.
"More and more summer movies
have felt a little cynical," Whedon
said. "There are .very, very big
exceptions to that, but that has
been the case when people throw so
much money down. ... They're not
interested in a story, they're inter-
ested in just barraging you with
excitement, and imagery, and brand
names."
He added: "Marvel doesn't
operate that way. They care about
the people. That's why they hire
some of the best actors in the busi-
ness to play their heroes. And this
is an old-fashioned movie: It's a
little bit bigger than life, but it's
very human."

President says the
issue is personal, he
graduated with debt
By JACOB AXELRAD
Editor in Chief
En route to Boulder, Colo-
rado, President Obama hosted a
conference call from Air Force
one on Tuesday with reporters
from college newspapers across
the country.
During the call, he explained
that if Congress fails to act in the
coming months, interest rates on
student loans will double by July
1.
Obama said that as many
as 7.4 million students could be
affected if the interest rate jumps
from its current 3.4 percent to an
estimated 6.8 percent by July. He
explained that for many Ameri-
can families, the increased rate
would make college unafford-
able.
"For the first time now we've
got Americans owing more debt
on their student loans than they
do on their credit cards," Obama
said.
The President said his cur-
rent tour includes the University
of North Carolina-Chapel Hill,
the University of Colorado-Boul-

der and the University of Iowa.
Obama said by visiting campuses
he hopes to reach out to students
directly on an issue that has
"never been more important."
- Obama explained that this
issue is personal for himself and
First Lady Michelle Obama.
"Students who take out loans
to pay for college graduate owing
an average of $25,000 a year," he
said. "And I know what this is
like, because when Michelle and
I graduated from college and law
school we had enormous debts,
and it took us a lot of years to pay
off (the debt)."
Obama explained that he
views the potential interest
rate rise as an issue of class and
said it is the duty of Americans
to help stop the middle class
from shrinking more than it has
already in previous years.
"We've got to build an econo-
my where everybody is getting a
fair shot, everybody is doing their
fair share, everybody is playing
by the same set of rules," he said.
"That's ultimately how the mid-
dle class gets stronger."
Following the main segment
of the conference call, Cecilia
Munoz - Assistant to the Presi-
dent and Director of the White
House Domestic Policy Council
- and Roberto Rodriguez - Spe-
cial Assistant to the President

for Education Policy - answered
questions from listening univer-
sity newspapers.
In Munoz's response to a
question from the Minnesota
Daily, she referenced the Presi-
dent's address at the Al Glick
Field House last January when
he discussed the importance of
a college degree and his plans to
alleviate student debt.
"(The President is) somebody
who understands what college
debt means in a student's life,"
Munoz said. "It hurts us eco-
nomically when students finish
with an average of $25,000 of
debt and you have to delay things
like buying a home or starting a
business."
When Spelman College asked
how Congress benefits from bat-
tling an increase in interest rate,
Munoz said it's an opportunity
for the House to demonstrate
bipartisan cooperation between
Democrats and Republicans.
By gathering support in
upcoming weeks, the White
House hopes to prove to Congress
that it has the necessary time to
pass this proposal with support
from both parties, according to
Munoz.
"The case that we're trying to
make here is that this is the kind
of thing that can get done in a
bipartisan way," she said.

team in competition with the Wol-
verines, then some 500,000 alumni
will hunt you down and paint you
maize and blue," Gupta said.
He also said the graduates should
drink a beer at Ashley's, which was
met with applause from listeners
and prompted Gupta to offer to buy
drinks for anyone he saw out on the
night of commencement - and the
cheers continued.
Gupta told anecdotes about
his children and his experiences
reporting abroad that have put his
life at risk.
He spoke about a time when he
was in a war zone in Afghanistan
and his camp was being invaded by
enemy soldiers. He was instructed
to write a letter to his loved ones in
case of his death. He suggested the
graduates think about what they
would write in such a situation.
"I don't know what you'd write,
and maybe you've never thought
two seconds about it, but lesson
number five graduates, make sure
you can write this sentence: 'I am
who I always wanted to be,"' he
said.
As the speakers in the stadium
were still echoing Gupta's final
words, the crowd erupted with a
"Go Blue" chant. University Presi-
dent Mary Sue Coleman paused to
laugh before continuing with the
ceremony.
During a press conference after
the speech, where Gupta donned
a navy blazer and maize socks, he
said Coleman asked him to be the
commencement speaker at a foot-
ball game.
"It was a tremendous honor," he
said. "I think it was particularly
exhilarating just being in the Big
House ... because this place has pro-
found memories for me."
After the ceremony, Gupta also
said that while the current econ-
omy is challenging, he feels the
graduates have an advantage when
it comes to finding jobs with their_
degrees from the University.
"I think Michigan graduates
are pretty uniquely prepared in
our collective society," Gupta said.
"It's tough (with) the economy, but
I think Michigan grads probably
have a leg up just because of the
education they have and also the
resources in terms of the alumni."
Gupta explained during his
speech the ways he defines the
Michigan tradition, telling the
graduates to never forget what the
tradition means as they go forth in
their lives.

"It's a Michigan tradition to take
risks and, in the process, blaze new
trails," Gupta said. "It's a Michigan
tradition to always read the direc-
tions but not always to follow them,
to always prepare but sometimes
throw that preparation in the trash
allowing yourself to be surprised,
honest and genuine. It's a Michi-
gan tradition to make history and
change the world, to be immortal
not as in living forever but as never
being forgotten."
Other speakers who addressed
the crowd of about 50,000 before
Gupta's speech included LSA Asso-
ciate Dean Philip Deloria, who
spoke in place of LSA Dean Ter-
rence McDonald who was unable to
attend, Engineering graduate Julia
Brennan and Coleman.
In Deloria's remarks, he
explained the word "gumption"
to the crowd, saying all of those
graduating have it. He said though
having gumption gives one "guts"
and "wits," it is not the only aspect
graduates will need in life as they
move forward.
"Mix one part gumption with
equal parts knowledge, commit-
ment, patience and the willingness
to take a risk," Deloria said. "Stir in
a healthy portion of liberal arts and
sciences education and you have
before you a recipe for success - a
recipe to become truly one of the
leaders and best."
Brennan, who was the selected
student speaker, asked the students
to never forget their first days at
the University, which she said was
a shared experience between all of
the graduates.
"Celebrate that unsettled feel-
ing," Brennan said. "Celebrate
Michigan for instilling in us the
confidence to thrive in everything
we choose to do."
Coleman was the last to speak
before the granting of the honorary
degrees. She spoke about creativ-
ity and said the graduates will need
to adopt new ways of thinking to
change the future.
"Simply put, we expect you to
raise a few eyebrows," Coleman
said.
Honorary degrees were awarded
by the University's Board of Regents
to five University alumni, including
Gupta, who received a Doctor of
Humane Letters.
J. Ira Harris, a financier, received
an honorary Doctor of Laws, and
Richard Sarns, a biomedical engi-
neer and entrepreneur, received an
honorary Doctor of Engineering.
Susan Orlean, author and writer
for The New Yorker magazine, and
Chris Van Allsburg, author and
illustrator, received honorary Doc-
tors of Humane Letters as well.

Stop student loan hi~kes
Students can't afford a 6.8 percent interest rate on loans
Jn todajy's economy, college has become an almost necessary invest-
ment in order to secure a job. It's an enormous expense that millions
of students have to deal with every day. Student loans, such as the
Stafford loan and Pell Grants, can take many years to pay off and contin-
ue to be a financial burden after graduating from college, with increasing
interest rates not making payments any easier. The House of Represen-
tatives voted on Friday to put a freeze on the student loan interest rate
increase and continue to subsidize at a lower rate. While it is commend-
able that the House is working to put a freeze on these loans in a fiscally
responsible manner, money should not be taken out of the Prevention and
Public Health Fund in order to compensate for the subsidy.

Wolverines lose two of three to Illinois

By GREG GARNO
Daily Sports Writer
Members of the No. 22 Michigan
softball team walked off the field on
Sunday with their heads held low,
frowning and ILLINOIS
averting their MICHIGAN 
eyes from the - -
crowd. They I -LLINOI 1
were silent IIHIAN 2
walking into
the club- ILLINOIS 21
house. The MICHIGAN 01
disappoint-
ment covered their faces.
The Wolverines (13-5 Big Ten,
33-15 overall) lost two of three
games against Illinois (7-11, 23-23)
at Alumni Field this weekend,
managing only three runs overall.
Originally delayed by rain, Saturday
began with gloomy weather and set
the tone for the series. Michigan
ended the weekend with a 2-0 loss
to the Fighting Illini, marked by the
Wolverines' four total hits.It was an
uncharacteristic showing for the
Wolverines, who needed a strong
performance against a mediocre
team to stay on top of the Big Ten,

in which they currently hold a half-
game lead.
"I told the kids we get what we
deserve," said Michigan coach
Carol Hutchins. "When we. play
with passion, when we play with
genuine enthusiasm, when we're
excited to be out there, we'll get
what we deserve."
Freshman right-hander Sara Dri-
esenga took the loss in the circle
in the final game despite giving up
only four hits and one earned run.
Neither team was able to pro-
duce much, but Illinois struck first
in the second inning. Senior first
baseman Amanda Chidester fielded
a grounder at first base, and tagged
it for the out, but the throw home
to freshman catcher Lauren Sweet
was not in time. Illinois scored
again in the fourth inning, when
Jess Perkins ran home after a wild
pitch by freshman left-hander Hay-
lie Wagner hit the backstop.
Michigan was unable to get any-
thing going during the game, leav-
ing eight runners stranded on base
- two of which came in the final
inning. Michigan still struggled in
the second game of the series, but

took advantage of base runners
when it counted, winning 2-1.
The game moved slow up to the
fourth inning when Driesenga got
the offense started with one of her
two walks on the day. With junior
Jaclyn Crummey pinch running
for Driesenga, Wagner came up to
bat and remained alive in the count
after hitting several foul balls, until
she crushed her fourth home run of
the season into the outfield stands.
But the Wolverines were unable
to hold the momentum after the
home run, and managed to produce
just six total hits.
"We're playing with fear and
fear is not acceptable in sports.
You can't be afraid that you're not
going to win, and we seem very
fearful," Hutchins said. "We're not
very attacking and we need to pick
up our level and our approach to
enthusiasm."
The lack of enthusiasm was most
evident in the first game of the
series, where Michigan lost, 5-1. As
usual, the Wolverines pitchingstaff,

as well. Both teams remained score-
less through seven innings after
stranding runners on base in all but
two innings, forcing the game to go
into the eighth inning. In relief, Dri-
esenga allowed two runs to begin
the eighth before Perkins blasted a
three-run home.run to give Illinois
a 5-0 lead.
Michigan could only muster one
run in the fifth, after sophomore

left-fielder Nicole Sappingfield sin-
gled to score Sweet with two outs.
Chidester came up to bat next, but
popped out, stranding two of Mich-
igan's 14 runners left on base.
"It's probably just nerves," Evans
said. "We just have to get every-
one in the right mindset and we'll
do fine. We're going to work hard.
We're going to figure it out. We
always do."

Multiple woes plague Michigan in two weekend losses

The College Cost Reduction and
Access Act, passed five years ago,
lowered the interest rate on Staf-
ford student loans from 6.8 per-
cent to 3.4 percent. For the average
student loan balance of $23,000,
this increase in interest rate would
cost about $40 extra per month
for 10 years following graduation.
The College Cost Reduction and
Access Act is set to expire on July
1st of this year. The House of Rep-
resentatives, however, has passed
a measure that would keep inter-
est rates at 3.4 percent. To fund
this, they would pull money from
the Prevention and Public Health
Fund, which supports breast and
cervical cancer screenings, prena-
tal tests for birth defects and child
immunizations.
Maintaining low interest rates
for college students should not be
a partisan issue. Many students
are deterred from attending col-
lege because of the sheer amount

of money they will have to pay
back in the future from student
loans. Unfortunately, for many
prospective college students, bor-
rowing money from parents is
simply not an option. According
to Rob French of Bridge Maga-
zine, University of Michigan stu-
dents graduate with an average
debt of $27,828. This substan-
tial amount of money cannot be
repaid quickly, and thus causes
students to live with this finan-
cial burden through their 20s and
beyond. Measures to reduce these
interest rates on student loans
should be thoroughly explored.
This is a pressing issue that the
House of Representatives, the
Senate and the President need to
come together to solve. While the
House of Representatives voted
to extend the subsidy for one
year, they argue that the only way
to finance this measure is to cut
funding from the Prevention and

Public Health Fund. Many have
coined this as a "politically moti-
vated" move that takes money
away from services important
to women. Approval ratings for
Congress are already extremely
low, and this inability to commu-
nicate and cooperate exemplifies
their ineffectiveness and blatant
disregard for a suitable compro-
mise.
A college degree is invaluable
in today's economy. It is the gov-
ernment's responsibility to help
reduce interest rates on these
loans and to make the finan-
cial burden of paying for college
as feasible as possible. Afford-
able student loans are an issue
that should extend beyond party
lines. The future workforce of our
nation may have to pay for the
government's inability to form a
viable solution on how to reduce
interest rates for students.

By COLLEEN THOMAS
Daily Sports Writer
The Michigan softball team is
slowly falling apart.
After a strong start to their Big'
Ten schedule, the 22nd-ranked
Wolverines have cooled off.
They began the conference sea-
son by sweeping Penn State and
Michigan State and dropping just
one game to Indiana. But since
classes ended on April 17, the squad
has lost its series to Minnesota and
Illinois.
On Sunday, the Wolverines lost,
the rubber game to the Fighting
Illini in a 2-0 decision after beat-
ing them 2-1 in the first game of the
doubleheader. They also lost a 5-1
game in extra innings on Saturday
after holding off Illinois' offense for
a full seven innings.
Michigan is starting to falter late
this season and it's time to take a
look at the areas that have been
struggling as of late - highlight-
ed by the weekend performance
against Illinois.
HITTING
The Wolverines have been con-

necting on pitches several times in
games - they tallied a total of 16
hits over the three games this week-
end - but haven't been consistent
across the board.
Michigan's power hitters, senior
first baseman Amanda Chidester
and junior second baseman Ashley
Lane, haven't produced as well as
they did last year. Lane went 0-for-5
against Illinois and hasn't recorded
a hit since April 22. Chidester's bat-
ting average is about 70 points lower
than last year's .432 average, due in
part to a 3-for-10 performance this
weekend.
The rest of the lineup hasn't
helped much, either. Freshman
pitcher Sara Driesenga seemed to
be hinting her stride at the plate
after earning a permanent spot in
the lineup as the designated player,
boosting her average to .380. But in
the past six games, she's gone 5-for-
16.
But sophomore Nicole Sapping-
field has stepped up recently, and
her performance earned her the
number-two spot in the lineup. Her
batting average has recently bro-
ken .300, good for third best on the

team, and has been one of the most
consistent hitters for the Wolver-
ines all season. But against Illinois,
she went 2-for-12, though Sapping-
field did record Michigan's only RBI
on Saturday.
In comparison to the recent
struggles on offense, the Wolver-
ines tallied a season-high 13 hits in a
game against Penn State on March
25 and have averaged almost eight
hits per game over the course of the
season.
RUNNERS LEFT ON BASE
Though the bats may be making
contact, the runs aren't pouring in.
Despite a six-hit game against
Illinois on Saturday, the Wolverines'
managed just one run.
Recently, the squad has left
quite a few runners on base. Michi-
gan stranded a total of 23 run-
ners against Illinois and left 18 on
base against Minnesota - runners
which could've easily turned into
tallies on the scoreboard.
In Saturday's game against the
Fighting Illini, the Wolverines had
a couple of chances early to put runs
on the board, but failed to do so. In
the second inning, two walks put

runners on first and second with no
outs, and a sacrifice bunt by junior
shortstop Amy Knapp advanced the
runners to second and third:
But two consecutive outs - a
strikeout and a ground out -
stranded two on base and ended any
chance of scoring.
In the third inning, Michigan
loaded the bases with one out and
again, the Wolverines couldn't con-
vert.
Michigan also had that problem
earlier in the season when it trav-
eled to Louisville. The Wolverines
left seven runners on base in both
losses that weekend, to the then-
16th-ranked Cardinals and St.
Louis.
Though stranding runners is
an obvious problem to a faltering
Michigan offense, Hutchins doesn't
believe that runners left on base is
the problem.
"We have to have quality at bats
whether there is a runner on base
or not," Hutchins said after the Red
and Black Tournament in March.
"The game doesn't know there are
runners on base.... We need to have
some quality at bats and make bet-

ter contact whether there (are) run-
ners on base or not."
DEFENSE
Michigan hasn't had difficulty
fielding, but sometimes errors can
be costly. And against Illinois this
weekend, errors hurt the Wolver-
ines.
The squad combined for five
errors over the weekend - not a
significant amount - but the errors
came at unfortunate times.
A fielding error in the second
inning of Sunday's second game
allowed an Illinois runner to reach
first. The Fighting Illini proceed-
ed to load the bases with no outs,
but a throw to freshman catcher
Lauren Sweet by Lane caught the
runner out at home. Michigan did
allow one run that inning, and the
error helped get the Fighting Illini
offense rolling. This was enough for
Illinois to win the game.
Though errors are a normal part
of the game, Evans knows it's not
the biggest issue.
"We're going to have some errors
in the game," Evans said. "But the
hitters have to back it up. We can't
dwell over little crors."

Western Division championship,
the 10th-ranked Michigan wom-
en's water polo team (4-2 CWPA,
23-12 overall) was looking to con-
tinue its success at the Eastern
Championships at Brown Uni-
versity this past weekend. But the
Wolverines fell short of a cham-
pionship with a 2-1 record in the
tournament.
On Friday, Michigan jumped
out to a quick start in its first game
against Bucknell (2-4, 15-24),
taking a 5-3 lead into halftime.
Michigan's attackers - sophomore
Lauren Dudley and junior Kiki
Golden - led the way with two
goals each in the first half.
As the second half began, the
Wolverines did not let off the gas.
Golden picked up a hat trick early
in the third quarter, and Michigan
took an 8-5 lead into the final quar-
ter.
Bucknell tried to make a come-

back off two quick goals to start the
fourth, but the Wolverines man-
aged to tally three of their own in
the final four minutes of play. The
scoring outburst by both teams led
to a final score of 12-8, and Michi-
gan headed to the semifinals the
next day.
With much excitement and opti-
mism, the Wolverines hopped into
the pool to face their 14th-ranked
division rival, Maryland. With a
championship berth at stake, the
Terrapins struck first.
Maryland scored first, as the
Wolverines managed to miss a pen-
alty shot shortly after conceding
the first goal. Following the missed
penalty were two more goals, giv-
ing the Terrapins a 3-0 lead after
the first quarter.
"If I knew (what caused the
slow start), we wouldn't have
been slow," said Michigan coach
Matt Anderson. "(Possibly) it was
because we missed the penalty
shot so early."
Whatever Anderson said in
the huddle after the first quarter
worked for the Wolverines, as they

rebounded nicely to knot the score
at four heading into the halftime
break.
The third quarter was a back-
and-forth affair, with the Wolver-
ines and the Terrapins exchanging
goals until the quarter ended, leav-
ing Maryland up, 7-6, heading into
the fourth quarter.
With the championship game
in sight, the Wolverines came
together to make one last attempt
at achieving glory.
The alternating trend of goals
continued in the final quarter, and
Maryland led Michigan, 9-8, head-
ing into the final possession.
The Wolverines drew a penalty
with two seconds remaining and
had one last chance to send the
game into overtime.
Golden was chosen to take the
final penalty shot, but the Mary-
land goalie stepped up and won the
game for the Terrapins.
"If we had to do it again, the best
player takes the final shot," Ander-
son said. "(We) missed two penal-
ties this game so maybe it wasn't
meant to be. They worked hard,

By PETER BROWN
Daily Sports Writer
Matt Thompson was too busy
to attend his graduation ceremony
on Saturday. '
While his fellow peers were
taking in Sanjay Gupta's com-
mencement speech at Michigan
Stadium, the senior was hitting
the links for his now-alma mater
at the 2012 Big Ten Champion-
ships in French Lick, Ind.
He didn't disappoint either.
Thompson (74-73-70-72) shot a
one-over-par, four-round total of
289, six shots behind champion
Luke Guthrie of Illinois - good for
third place individually.
"I felt like I got off to a good
start pretty much every round,"
Thompson said. "(The) first two
rounds, I ended up with a couple
higher scores than I would've
liked to."
The same could be said for a
majority of the competitors as
well. As the first-ever neutral site
of the men's golf Big Ten Cham-
pionships, the Pete Dye Course
at French Lick Resort gritted
its teeth all weekend long. Dye's
course layouts frequently are
given the moniker "Dye-abolical."
"(It) was probably one of, if not
the toughest course we've played
all year," Thompson said. "Every
hole was a grind. There wasn't
really one hole where you stood
on the tee box and you felt like you
had to make birdie. Par was a good
score on every hole."
Following Saturday's third
round, Thompson was in sole
possession of second place, seven
strokes behind Guthrie, who shot
a stellar five-under-par 67 in the
round.
"Unfortunately, Luke (Guth-
rie) played so well in that third
round," Thompson said. "After
he triple-bogeyed one of his first
holes, he then had eight birdies.
That's just crazy."
During Sunday's final round,
Thompson shot an even-par 72,
complete with two birdies and
two bogeys. Guthrie finished his
tournament with a one-over 73,
good for a five-under-par total,
four strokes ahead of second-place
finisher Sam Chien of North-
western and six shots in front of
Thompson.

"There was a pretty good gap
for (Thompson) to make up at the
start of the day," said Michigan
coach Chris Whitten. "This golf
course does not really allow for
someone to go out there and tear
it up."
It's been an uphill battle for
the Wolverines this spring. In
order to make their fifth-straight
NCAA Regional appearance, they
needed to win the the tourna-
ment outright for an automatic
bid. Ultimately, the Wolverines'
inexperience that made them fall
short.
"We had four guys who had
never played in the Big Ten Cham-
pionship before," Whitten said.
"So, I think it was a learning expe-
rience for them. I know all of them
wish that they had played better,
and they're capable of playing bet-
ter.
"We're just going to take this
tournament and learn from it, and
it'll help us get motivated for the
summer and for next year."
Junior Miguel Echavarria was
Michigan's second-best scorer of
the tournament, ending with a
21-over-par total and tied for 33rd.
The other three Wolverines mak-
ing the trip down to French Lick
were freshman Noori Hyun, who
finished 55th, freshman Andrew
Wong, who finished 56th, and
junior Matt Alessi, who finished
59th.
The Wolverines finished in 10th
place in the team standings, one
place behind their initial seeding
for the tournament.
As for Thompson - Michigan's
record-holder for lowest scoring
average in a season - his steady
play all season long will more than
likely warrant an individual berth
at the NCAA Regional. On May 7,
the NCAA will release its choices
for individual at-large bids. If
Thompson receives a bid, then
he'll be playing at his home course
come mid-May.
"(Matt) has had a great year
and he just keeps getting better,"
Whitten said. "The thing about
him is his consistency. He just
shows up at every single tourna-
ment playing well and he did that
again this week."
The NCAA Central Region-
al will be held at the U-M Golf
Course May 17-19.

but there were a couple keys to the

rnm

game that allowed Maryland to get
their goals."
After a tough loss to rival
Maryland, the Wolverines had to
rebound quickly for their third
place game against Brown Univer-
sity (3-2, 20-18).
Michigan jumped out to a quick
lead with two goals from Gold-
6 en before surrendering the lead
before halftime.
In the third quarter, however, it

goals in the third to bring her game

crown.

expectations, but we didn't meet

best," Anderson said.

Almost everyone is a criminal.
If you have ever smoked marijua-
na, consumed alcohol underage
or walked on railroad tracks, you
are guilty of a misdemeanor. You
would most likely be in prison
right now if you were convicted
for every single offense you ever
committed.
We want the police to use
their authority to punish people
who injure others, however, they
often use their power to harass
and imprison those who have not
harmed anyone. Many think that
the police only enforce the law, and
that anyone who goes to prison is
getting whatthey deserve. But this
is not always the case. We are all
criminals, but those of us who are
not in a targeted group can, for the
most part, ignore this. The police
rely on individual complaints and
don't always enforce the law in a
just manner. If every crime were
prosecuted,>courts and prisons
would be overflowing with pris-
oners. If this were the case, politi-
cians and their supporters would
be caught in the system, making
it necessary to reform laws and
restrict police authority.
To avoid criticism, police offi-
cers often only arrest those who
they can get away with target-
log. Officers respond totvalid
complaints, but they also harass
homeless people, radical politi-
cal groups and religious groups
who have little political power.
The process of choosing whom to
watch and arrest is largely invis-
ible to the public. Police depart-
ments, such as the University of
Michigan's Department of Public
Safety (DPS), have internal poli-
cies and individual officers that
can choose when to arrest people
or let them off with warnings.
-Surveillance cameras make this
process even more secretive and
powerful. With cameras readily
available, the police do not need

citizens' complaints to justify
who they choose to target. Video
surveillance is not limited by the
size of a police staff, and officers
are held less accountable by the
public, when they use surveillance
cameras. In order to promote a just
community that protects peopies'
civil liberties and rights, the peo-
ple need a say in police authority,
and installing more surveillance
cameras does just the opposite.
University Vice President for
Student Affairs E. Royster Harper
and DPS leaders have suggested
installing more cameras because
of the recent increase in larcenies.
Administrators must not agree to
this and can support this argu-
ment with evidence from around
the world showing that surveil-
lance cameras are often ineffective
in preventing crime. Regardless
of such data, some students will
support the plan and many will
remain apathetic because they do
not think the police will be inter-
ested in targeting them. While
these students may be right, we
must not endanger the civil liber-
ties of those whom the police are
likely to target.
We should only accept increased
police surveillance if it will bring
us great benefits along with this
cost. While DPS has a unique duty
to promote campus safety, it must
not be given free rein to unnec-
essarily control our civil liber-
ties. It is critical that DPS and
University administrators look
carefully at the potential costs of
surveillance cameras on campus.
Slightly reducing the chance that
our laptops are stolen is not a good
enough reason to give up what
little oversight we have over our
campus police.

It's finally summer vacation.
After many months of wait-
ing, it's time for long weekends
with friends, movie marathons
and, in some
households, the
sound of cable
news com-
mentators fill-
ing the home
as families go_
about their
daily lives.
It's no secret MICHAEL
that cable news SPAETH
isn't always the
most objec-
tive. In fact, studies have shown
that cable news often misinforms
its viewers. In November 2011, a
study by Fairleigh Dickinson Uni-
versity found that Fox News view-
ers were "less likely to know that
Egyptians overthrew their gov-
ernment" than people who didn't
watch any news at all. The study
also found that MSNBC viewers
were "most likely to think the
(Occupy Wall Street) protestors
are Republicans" than people
who didn't watch any news.
The large amount of viewers
absorbing this misinformation is
certainly troubling. The real prob-
lem, however, lies in the common
belief that watchingtelevision is a
passive experience. This, in turn,
makes it difficult for viewers to
rationally consider political issues
and events. As The New York
Times columnist Jane Brody stat-
ed in 2004, watching television is
a "mentally passive activity." Nor-
mally, we watch television when
we are relaxing, texting a friend
or doing another activity. Let's be
honest - we don't carefully ana-
lyze everything we see on televi-
sion. Instead, we just sit back and
enjoy the show.
Most of the time, there's noth-
ing wrong with that. Sitcoms,
sports games, home improvement
shows, dramas and most other
shows on television aren't sup-
posed to be carefully scrutinized.
They're meant to be enjoyed.
These shows are clearly adver-

tised as entertainment and should
be treated as such.
News programs, however,
aren't supposed to be entertain-
ment. They're there to be actively
analyzed and critiqued by view-
ers when the information isn't
correct or when politicians aren't
being held accountable for their
actions by the news media. Yet,
cable news is becoming a form of
entertainment in which commen-
tators compete to be the loudest
voice in the room, catering to the
preferences and beliefs of specific
viewers at the expense of provid-
ing a vital service to our country.
If we treat cable news as enter-
tainment, we will naturally sit
back and enjoy the show, instead
of scrutinizing the content of the
programs. When watching cable
news becomes a passive expe-
rience, we consciously give up
our willpower to fight back with
our own logical reasoning. Most
importantly, without rational and
informed citizens, our country is
weakened greatly.
When we read bodies of text,
our minds are more engaged than
they are when watching televi-
sion. In 2009, Dr. Jennifer Otten
of Stanford University's School
of Medicine told The New York
Times, "compared to watching
television, you burn more calories
reading, writing, doing desk work
- pretty much any activity other
than sleeping." In November,
Associate Professor Dr. Ahmad
Salehi of Stanford University also
told The New York Times, "for
everyone, the evidence is very,
very strong that physical activity
will ... improve cognitive health."
Since we are more physically
active when we read than when
we watch television, reading bod-
ies of text can help to improve our
cognition and, in turn, improve
our understanding of the facts
underlying important political
issues.
Although some articles in news-
papers, news magazines and other
publications may contain con-
tent that is similar to the content

of cable news shows, the notion
that our cognition improves when
we read bodies of text suggests
that our minds are more capable
of fighting back against illogical
arguments when we read. Even
the Internet - which poses another
set of problems for our cognitive
processing, according to writers
like Nicholas Carr - is likely to be
better for our minds than televi-
sion because we choose what we
read on the Internet, we read at
our own pace and our minds are
actively processing the informa-
tion. When we read, the television
does not determine what informa-
tion we absorb or the rate at which
we receive that information.
News
programs aren't
entertainment
As the future leaders and great
thinkers of the world, we need to
get in the habit of actively ques-
tioning and analyzing informa-
tion in the political arena on its
own terms, without the interfer-
ence of cable news commentators
who could possibly be spreading
misinformation. Even if news net-
works won't meet their respon-
sibilities toward our country, we
can still meet our responsibilities
to ourselves and our futures. We
can start by reading about news
to further exercise our cogni-
tive abilities. But when the TV is
inevitably turned on, we need to
separate entertainment from sub-
stantive content that impacts our
lives and think about the material
accordingly.
I plan to watch some comedies
during my summer vacation. I
might even watch a drama or two.
But cable news won't be the source
of my relaxation this summer.

Guerrier added that implement-
ing LearnZillion means overcom-
ing the technology limitations of
school districts.
"It's more that the structure
in schools actually makes it very
hard to effectively use technology.
Sometimes there's bad connec-
tivity, sometimes there's crappy
and old hardware, but also there
are rules about it," Guerrier said.
"There are rules about using stuff
in class, and rules about where you
can use it, and then from our per-
spective, there are a lot of educa-
tion products that are more built
with a school district in mind
rather than an individual teacher,
if that makes sense."
Guerrier said LearnZillion
appreciates the SvF investment
and connection to the University
the investment brings.
"Being introduced to and hav-
ing access to interested students is
great," Guerrier said. "We have an
intern, in fact maybe two coming
from Michigan ... that's awesome."
Guerrier added that LearnZil-
lion continues to improve with
help from professors and students
in the School of Education at the
University.
"One of the things that's impor-
tant for us as an education organi-
zation, providing an (education)
service directed at teachers and
students, is being able to measure
the impact that we have on learn-
ing for our users," Guerrier said.
"Basically access to that academic
mind at the Ed. School helped
guide that research, and that's a
relationship that's continuing."
Business Prof. Gautam Kaul
oversees SvF and said it is a two-
year program with an application
process that includes intense work
and research in making invest-
ment decisions.
Kaul said the nature of the fund
goes back to the roots of business
as a tool for social welfare.
"I believe business was created
to serve society, and I think that's
what our business proposition is,"
Kaul said.
Kaul added that the goal of
the fund is to display the positive
effects of financial ventures and
the impact they can have on the
well-being of society.
"We are very keen on showing
to the world that doing good is
financially sustainable," Kaul said.
"It is not that you can only make
money by serving the rich, we
want to prove that entrepreneur-
ship in creating things for people
who do not have the resources
most of us are fortunate to have is
a viable business model."

April 11, Drake came in as a pinch
hitter, but struck out to finalize
the series loss.
"Every little thing is magnified
for us," Maloney said. "We haven't
been able to play over it, pitch over
it or make the next play."
In the final contest, freshman
left-hander Trent Szkutnik gave
up five earned runs in 2.2 innings.
The defensive woes settled in the
third inning when sophomore
right-hander Alex Lakatos stepped
up with a 5-1 deficit to work with.
In his 4.1 innings of action,
Lakatos struck out six batters,
giving up no earned runs and just
two walks. But he couldn't recover
from a few mental mistakes.
"Lakatos was (good) today, for
a while," Maloney said. "Then he
kind of hit a blunder.... But outside
of that, he was sharp."
The Wolverines belted what
would seem like a successful num-
ber of hits - they tallied 35, but
stranded 26 base runners. It had
a multitude of opportunities to

score, but Michigan just couldn't
find the timely hit.
Though the Wolverines strug-
gled in crucial moments, there
were a handful of players that
encouraged Maloney at the plate.
Senior third baseman John
Lorenz extended his six game hit-
ting streak - four of which were
multi-hit outings. He manned
the hot corner with experienced
defensive plays and consistently
made contact at the plate.
Lorenz posted solid numbers,
going 5-for-11 with four runs on
four singles, a double and three
walks.
Equally impressive was White,
in his rookie campaign, who
cleared the bases with two con-
secutive-game home runs in oppo-
site-field shots.
"We've had guys, especially
right now, like ... Lorenz that are
playing really well and it's nice to
finally get in there and contribute
to their success," White said. "It
feels good."
Though a number of players are
satisfied with their own efforts,
they're unhappy with the way the
team pieces it together. To them,
nothing really matters when
Michigan sits at the bottom of the
Big Ten and gets swept by Indiana.
"I feel okay," Lorenz said. "It's
good to start helping out the team
a little more. ... But it just doesn't
feel good losing."

Wolverines come up short against Purdue in tournament

By SCOTT FREEDMAN
Daily Sports Writer
The Michigan women's tennis
team came up short in the final
match of the Big Ten Tournament
against Purdue on Sunday.
Losing the dual match, 4-3, the
No. 15 Wolverines failed to cap off
the weekend in Columbus success-
fully, despite having captured a
share of the Big Ten regular season
championship a week ago.
Michigan entered the tourna-
ment as the second seed, earning
a first-round bye. The team went
on to trounce Indiana and Illinois
on its way to the final showdown
against Purdue.

Friday's match against Indiana
marked the fifth-straight match
in which Michigan claimed the
coveted doubles point. The Wol-
verines, strengthened by the
ninth-straight victory from the
No. 10 duo of freshman Emina
Bektas and sophomore Brooke
Bolender, used the momentum of
the doubles victories to surge past
the Hoosiers, taking the overall
match, 4-2.
Saturday was the high point of
the weekend, as Michigan blanked
Illinois with a final score of 4-0.
Bektas and Bolender, who secured
the doubles win yet again, locked
up individual victories as well.
Also performing impressively was

No. 121 junior Mimi Nguyen, who
coasted to a straight-set victory,
despite trailing 4-0 in the first set.
When the dust settled on Sat-
urday, Michigan had taken every
single match from No. 20 Illinois,
cementing the Wolverines' domi-
nance over the Illini this season.
Sunday was where the Wolver-
ines seemed to run out of magic.
Despite jumping out to an early
advantage, nabbing the doubles
point, Michigan could not capital-
ize on the solid start and ended up
falling just short in the final sin-
gles match.
The weekend marks yet another
disappointing finish for the Wol-
verines in the Big Ten Tourna-

ment. Historically, in each of the
past eight seasons, Michigan has
advanced to the final match of
the weekend. Despite constant
appearances, Michigan has lost all
eight-consecutive Big Ten Cham-
pionship matches. The Wolverines
have only won the title once in the
team's history, grabbing the cham-
pionship in 1997.
Michigan coach Ronni Bern-
stein, while dissatisfied with the
tough loss, asserts the importance
of moving on, especially with
the NCAA Tournament rapidly
approaching.
"We've had a good year, and we
have to look at the big picture,"
Bernstein said. "This is definitely

disappointing, but it's also some-
thing that we can hopefully learn
from. I want to see them go after
it and play to win rather than be
scared to lose.
"We still have the postseason,
and that's what we're looking
forward to now. You want to play
matches like this, win or lose,
because it makes you better just to
compete like this. This definitely
hurts, but once we get back home
and start practicing, we'll really
focus in on the NCAAs."
The Wolverines will return to
Ann Arbor to await their selection
for the NCAA Tournament. The
selection show will take place on
May 5.
