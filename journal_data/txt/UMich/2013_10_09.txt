STUDENT GOVERNMENT
CSG partners
with IFC to
expand Blue
Bus services

Routes to run
Thurs. through Sat.,
include off-campus
neighborhoods
By AMRUTHA SIVAKUMAR
Daily StaffReporter
When January comes roll-
ing around, students can expect
to see more Blue Buses rolling
through off-campus neighbor-
hoods.
The Central Student Govern-
ment announced Tuesday that
S5 it had partnered with the Inter-
fraternity Council to pilot an
off-campus bus route that will
run at least three days of the
week. Starting Winter 2014, the
bus route will utilize existing
Ann Arbor Area Transportation
Authority and University bus
stops from 10 p.m. to 3 a.m. on
Thursdays, Fridays and Satur-
days.
After re-reading all of the
crime alerts that he has received
since arriving at the University
four years ago, CSG President

Michael Proppe said the alerts
prove that there is a need for
safer off-campus transporta-
tion services. He said 84 percent
of reported crimes took place
after 10:00 p.m., 67 percent took
place off-campus and 64 percent
occurred in scenarios in which
the victim was walking.
The idea of a bus route oper-
ating off campus was first dis-
cussed during an IFC during
the Winter 2013 semester. As
a result, Proppe and CSG Vice
President Bobby Dishell, also the
vice president of recruitment for
IFC, incorporated an off-campus
route as one of their six platform
promises in the March CSG elec-
tions.
In a process that began in
April and involved dialogue
that lasted the duration of the
summer and included meeting
with University administrators
in Parking and Transportation
Services, University of Michigan
Police Department and the Office
of Student Life.
Discussions with the AA4TA
regarding the agency's own
research solidified that a fixed

Before University President
Mary Sue Coleman reached the
podium at her annual leader-
ship breakfast Tuesday morn-
ing, the atmosphere inside Ross
School of Business's colloqui-
um had already become bitter-

sweet.
In her final State of the Uni-
versity address, Coleman's
impending departure was evi-
dent in her reflections on devel-
opment, research and student
life with rounds of applause
and cheers. The gathering of
administrators and Univer-
sity supporters lauded their
president not only for the last
year's work, but for more than a
decade spent at the University's
helm.
"It would be easy to be a bit
melancholy, but there's no time
for that," Coleman said. "There's
simply too much momentum to
do anything but look ahead."

During her speech, she laid
out lofty goals for "the Michi-
gan of tomorrow," including a
$1-billion campaign fundrais-
ing goal for financial aid alone
- nearly double the $545 mil-
lion raised for that purpose dur-
ing the previous campaign, The
Michigan Difference. Coleman
said student support must be
the top priority of The Victors
for Michigan Campaign, set to
begin Nov.8.
"We want every student, no
matter where they hail from, or
what their family circumstance,
to have access to a Michigan
education," she said. "No goal
is more important. We must

provide financial support for
talented students we admit to
ensure the academic quality of
Michigan."
Coleman also addressed the
national concern of college
affordability, which has been
compounded by rising tuition
rates at the University. Between
the 2004 and 2012 academic
years, LSA tuition increased 60
percent for in-state students and
55 percent for out-of-state stu-
dents.
To ensure that students see
financial aid rise with tuition,
the campaign will work to
ensure that higher education is

Funded by CSG,
more students will
attend this year
By YARDAIN AMRON
Daily StaffReporter
As University students count
down the days to Fall Break,
about 50 students have their
hearts set on the weekend after,
when they will carpool to Pitts-
burgh to join 10,000 fellow
youth leaders from across the
nation for the Powershift con-
ference.
The biannual youth summit
is aimed at training and edu-
cating the next generation on
climate change and demand-
ing from leaders a shift in pol-
icy from fossil fuels to clean
energy. From Oct. 18 to Oct. 21,
registered youth leaders will
hear from keynote speakers
and participate in panel and
workshop trainings on a range
of environmental and social
issues. Participants will also
enjoy concerts featuring artists
such as Big K.R.I.T. and Talib
Kweli.
Created and organized by
the youth-led Energy Action

Coalition, the conference
entered the international scene
in 2007, when a few hundred
youth leaders converging on
Washington, D.C. quickly grew
to 6,000. That number doubled
to almost 12,000 by 2009.
This year will mark the Uni-
versity's first sizeable presence
at the conference. Public Policy
junior Marissa Solomon was
still a high-school senior and
aspiring rabbi when she attend-
ed Powershift in April 2011.
Having already been accept-
ed to the University, Solomon
noticed a lack of Wolverines at
the summit. There were only
two, to be exact, perhaps due to
the April conference's concur-
rence with finals week. In com-
parison, she said there were 50
students from Ohio State Uni-
versity, another 50 from Michi-
gan State University and 20
from Kalamazoo College.
While this year's conference
does not coincide with finals,
Solomon and her team still con-
fronted many hurdles. Fund-
ing remained the biggest issue.
EAC charges a registration
fee that has risen from $50 to
$80 - a fee many students are
unable to afford.

9/11 with help of

The University's chapter
of the Delta Gamma women's
fraternity hosted best-selling
author Michael Hingson for its
second Lectureship in Ethics

and Leadership event Tuesday
to a crowd of about 200 stu-
dents and guests.
Blind since birth, Hingson
was at work on the 78th floor
of the World Trade Center on
9/11. Roselle, then his guide
dog, led Hingson and others
down the 78 flights of stairs
and through the chaotic situa-
tion that ensued that day.
Lectureship is a national
Delta Gamma event that will
occur on 19 campuses through-

out the country this year. This
is Delta Gamma's second such
event at the University. The
first was held in spring 2011
and featured Kerry Kennedy,
an American human rights
activist and writer.
LSA junior Ailie Steir, vice
president of communications
for Delta Gamma, said the

SPIN CYCLE STRIKES AT LEAST FOUR TIMES IN ONE MONTH
Alleged'poopetrator' at large at Yale University

At least four times in the past
month, an unknown individual
or group of people has soiled
students' laundry in dryers with
urine and feces, The Yale Daily
News reported Monday.
Early Friday morning, stu-
dentswere alertedby e-mailthat
a laundry line of soiled clothing
- later proved to be stained by
chocolate - was strung outside
the Saybrook residence hall.
Yale security officials say
they're increasing security in
laundary rooms; but students
tell the Daily News that it's
unclear if changes have been
made at other residence halls.
Yale police and. administra-
tors are investigating the issue
and reviewing laundry-room

security.
The Daily News reports that
rumors have come to light on
campus that suggest that a
prank group may be responsible
for the soiling.
In incidents like this, hall
directors at Yale, known as
masters, are finding it difficult
to protect the safety of stu-
dents while still allowing them
to have freedom from constant
surveillance, according to the
Daily News.

Turmoil leaves scars on Cairo *

Vivacious city
now has curfew,
unfriendly spirit
CAIRO (AP) - Egypt's capital
has long been proud of its nick-
name, "Mother of the World"
- a metropolis of 18 million
throbbing with the vitality and
fun of other great cities, even if
at times it seemed unmanage-
able and chaotic.
But Cairo's spirit has been
deeply scarred by 32 months of
turmoil and bloodshed from two
"revolutions," constant protests
and crackdowns, and a military
coup.
Residents talk of an unfa-
miliar edginess. People are
more suspicious of each other,
whether because of increased
crime or constant media warn-
ings of conspiracies and terror-
ism.
Families are split by bitter
ideological differences. Fights'

are sparked by a word or a ges-
ture seen as supporting either
the military or the Islamists
who were ousted from power by
the armed forces.
The mood goes beyond ideol-
ogy. With police battered by the
upheaval and rarely enforcing
regulations, many people flout
laws with no thought of the
consequences - whether it's
the cafes that take over side-
walks or thugs who seize plots
of land.
A curfew in place for nearly
two months has put a damper
on Cairo's nightlife. It has been
eased to start at midnight, but
that was usually the hour when
streets and parties were just
getting lively.
Political violence has killed
more than 2,000 people in the
city and wounded many oth-
ers, starting with the Jan. 25,
2011, revolution that ousted
autocrat Hosni Mubarak. That
was followed by demonstra-
tions against the military rulers


who replaced Mubarak, the pro-
tests during President Moham-
med Morsi's year in office,
and the June 30 "revolution"
that prompted the July 3 coup
against the president.
"Political differences have
made some people lose their
humanity," said Shaiymaa
Awad, a 32-year-old Morsi sup-
porter.
Awad said she was in a
bus recently that drove past
Rabaah el-Adawiya, the mosque
where hundreds of Islamists
were killed in August when
police cracked down on a sit-in
demanding Morsi's reinstate-
ment.
When she broke down crying,
"other passengers looked sur-
prised, but none of them under-
stood why," Awad said.
The Rabaah mosque is not the
only city landmark now more
famous for one of the violent
incidents of the past 21/2 years.
Others include:
- Ajistoric bridge over the
Nile, once a favored romantic
spot for couples, that was the
site of a battle between police
and anti-Mubarak protesters.
- The towering Nile-side
state TV headquarters nick-
named "Maspero," now known
for the army's killing of more
than 25 Christian protesters.
- Moqattam, once simply
the rocky plateau overlooking
the city where couples went to
steal kisses, now- remembered
for a bloody street fight between
Muslim Brotherhood support-
ers and opponents.
New neighborhoods joined
the list Sunday, when Morsi
supporters and police clashed,
killing at least 40 people. With
more streets strewn with debris
and blackened by fires, Cairenes
fear the city is turning into a
Baghdad or a Beirut at their
most violent.
"Blood is everywhere," said
Belal Fadl, a popular satirical
columnist and scriptwriter,
"It is good that life goes on
after every episode of blood-
shed, but it is terrible from a
human perspective," he said,
adding that people now react to
violence "as if they are watching
it on asilver screen."

Detroit gets 35
days to develop
plan for lawsuits
A federal judge issued an order
Tuesday giving Detroit officials 35
days to develop and present a plan
to settle lawsuits that were pend-
ing before the city filed for bank-
ruptcy protection.
The order from Judge Steven
Rhodes would allow a lawsuit by
the mother of a slain police offi-
cer to move forward at the end
of the 35-day period unless the
city's plan was approved or a time
extension granted.
Dozens of unsettled lawsuits
against the city automatically
were put on hold July 18 when
Detroit emergency manager
Kevyn Orr filed the bankruptcy
petition.

Judge hears
estimates of BP oil
spill damages
For weeks after BPs massive
2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico,
people across the globe were cap-
tivated by a live video feed from
underwater cameras that showed
the company's blown-out well
belching plumes of black crude
into the water.
On Monday, more than three
years later, clips from the spill
cam were projected on a screen
in a New Orleans courtroom
while lawyers for BP and the fed-
eral government quarreled over
how much oil gushed out of BP's
Macondo well during the 87-day
crisis. The images helped some of
the scientists calculate how much
oil polluted the Gulf.
Determining how much oil
spilled is a multibillion-dollar
question for U.S. District Judge
Carl Barbier, who is presiding
over the trial involving the deadly

Deepwater Horizon rig explosion
and the nation's worst offshore oil
spill. The judge ultimately could
decide how much more money BP
owes for its role in the disaster.
NAIROBI, Kenya
1,600 ivory pieces
hidden in sesame
seeds
Kenyan officials are counting
and weighing more than 1,600
pieces of illegal ivory found hid-
den inside bags of sesame seeds in
freight traveling from Uganda to
Kenya's major port city, Mombasa.
Kenya Wildlife Service offi-
cial Arthur Tuda said Tuesday
that smugglers hid small pieces of
ivory inside hundreds of 90-kilo-
gram (200-pound) bags of seeds.
Tuda said officials have found
1,642 ivory pieces weighingnearly
5 tons in two shipping containers
bound for Turkey.
Tuda said the seized ivory, dis-
covered by officials last week, did
notcome fromrecentkills. He said
no suspects were in custody.
Wildlife officials are alarmed at
the increasing number of African
elephants and rhinos being killed
to feed demand in Asia, particu-
larly China, for ivory and rhino
horn powder.

"an intellectual passport, not a fis-
cal anchor," she said.
"Investing in Michigan pro-
vides life-long dreams," Coleman
said. "Higher education is the
single most important invest-
ment students can make for their
futures."
Coleman and her husband, political
scientist Kenneth Coleman, contrib-
uted to student aid with as $1-million
gift that will provide financialsupport
forstudy-abroad programs.
She will leave the University
only a few months into the new
development drive.
"Campaigns are notthe vision of
the president, but rather the aspi-
rations of the broader University
community," Coleman said. "The
immense planning that has gone
into it is a wonderful gift to the
University's next leader."
Coleman also touched on an
array of accomplishments from the
previous year. When she began her
tenure in 2002, she completed for-
mer University President Lee Bol-
linger's work with the Michigan
Difference campaign.
She also oversaw the comple-
tion of the Life Sciences Institute,
which is celebrating its 10th anni-
versary this year. Throughout
her years as president, Coleman
launched the Residential Life Ini-
tiative, which continues with the
renovation of South Quad Resi-
dence Hall, and approved the ren-
ovations of the student unions and
recreation buildings.
The breakfast was not only the
last for Coleman, but also for var-
ious administrators who plan to
step down from their roles. Ted
Spencer, executive director of
undergraduate admissions, and
Lester Monts, senior vice provost
for academic affairs, will resign
from their respective positions,
serving for more than 25 years
and 20 years, respectively.
Additionally, Constance Cook, the

executive director for the Center for
Research on Learning and Teach-
ing, and Ruth Person, the chancellor
of the University of Michigan-Flint,
willretire from their roles.
Though Coleman's speech
urged the University to push for-
ward, she did not end her final
State of the University address
without lingering in the past.
With the University's 2017
bicentennial, Coleman said the
anniversary serves as an opportu-
nity to redefine the campus. Cole-
man appointed Gary Krenz, who
serves as special counsel to the
president, to work as the co-chair
for programs surrounding the
milestone.
"The bicentennial compels us to
rediscover this impact, tell it and
celebrate it," Coleman said.

ize the University's vast history early

ees to imagine "a seminal moment"

Ann Arbor from Detroit, came for-
ward to support the University.
"It's- 1840," Coleman began.
"And what we know was the Diag
was a scrubby pasture. A lone
classroom building faces State
Street ... And now a gift arrives. It
is a German encyclopedia from a
fur trader who has never been to
Ann Arbor. We don't know why he
chose the University, but we know
he believed strongly in educating
the next generation, including his.
own children."
Channeling that distant moment
from the penthouse of a building
she helped bring to reality, Cole-
man allowed a speech on the Uni-
versity's future to dip into its past.
"The University of Michigan
is about legacies, and it is about
futures, about historic encyclope-
dias and talented freshmen," she
said. "We're reflecting on all of
them, on everything that's been
accomplished in using those expe-
riences to move forward on bold
ideas, crazy dreams, and using
them to create the University of
tomorrow."

BUS

bus route would be more effec-
tive than expanding SafeRide,
a University service for late-
night transportation between
campus buildings and areas
within a one-mile radius of
campus.
While the initial cost of
$30,000 to run the route for the
first semester will be equally
split between IFC and the CSG

executive branch's discretion-
ary budget, running the route
for additional semesters will
rely on the success of the pro-
gram and a permanent stream
of financial support from spon-
sors.
The operation of the bus
route during additional days
of the week will depend on the
support of CSG and other spon-
sors, Proppe said. He hopes that
by the time January hits,he will
secure approximately $70,000
to run the route all week.

Because the idea for an off-
campus transportation system
was initially conceived in the
IFC; Dishell said the council
wanted to continue to collabo-
rate with CSG. IFC President
Michael Freedman said the
councilwas optimistic about its
success.
"It all really depends on
the numbers and the results,"
Freedman said. "But we're
pretty positive in thinking that
the crime rates will go down
because of the bus route."

Obama nominates
Yellen to head U.S.
monetary pOlicy as
Fed. Reserve head

After Summers
withdrew nom.,
Yellen would become
first chairwoman
WASHINGTON (AP) - Presi-
dent Barack Obama will nomi-
nate Federal Reserve vice chair
Janet Yellen to succeed Ben
Bernanke as chairman of the
nation's central bank, the White
House said Tuesday. Yellen
would be the first woman to head
the powerful Fed, taking over at
a pivotal time for the economy
and the banking industry.
Both Yellen and Bernanke
are scheduled to appear with
Obama at the White House
on Wednesday for a formal
announcement.
Bernanke will serve until his
term ends Jan. 31, completing a
remarkable eight-year tenure in
which he helped pull the U.S.
economy out of the worst finan-
cial crisis and recession since the
1930's.
Under $ernanke's leadership,
the Fed created extraordinary
programs after the financial
crisis erupted in 2008 that are
credited with helping save the
U.S. banking system. The Fed
lent money to banks after credit
markets froze, cut its key short'-
term interest rate to near zero
and bought trillions in bonds
to lower long-term borrowing
rates.
Yellen, 67, emerged as the
leading candidate after Law-
rence Summers, a former Trea-
sury secretary whom Obama was
thought to favor, withdrew from
consideration last month in the
face of rising opposition.
A close ally of the chairman,
she has been a key architect of
the Fed's efforts under Bernanke
to keep interest rates near record
lows to support the economy;
and she would likely continue
steering Fed policy in the same
direction as Bernanke.
The White House announce-
ment comes in the midst of a

confrontation between Obama
and congressional Republi-
cans, particularly those in the
House, over the partial govern-
ment shutdown and the looming
breach of the nation's $16.7 tril-
lion borrowing limit. Obama has
been harshly critical of Repub-
licans for demanding either
changes in health care or spend-
ing policies in exchange for pay-
ing for government operations
and raising the debt ceiling.
White House aides, however,
said Obama was not likely to use
Yellen's nomination announce-
ment for partisan remarks on the
shutdown and debt limit. f.
Mark Zandi, chief economist
at Moody's Analytics, said that
the administration probably
decided to go ahead with the
announcement to send a signal of
policy stability to financial mar-
kets, where investors are grow-
ing increasingly nervous over
the partial shutdown and what
they perceive as the much bigger
threat of a default on Treasury
debt if Congress does not raise
the borrowing limit.
"Markets are very unsettled
and they are likely to become
even more unsettled in coming
days," Zandi said.. "Providing
some clarity around who will be
the next Fed chairman should
help at least at the margin."
As vice chair since 2010, Yel-
len has helped manage both the
Fed's traditional tool of short-
term rates and the unconven-
tional programs it launched to
help sustain the economy after
the financial crisis erupted in
2008. These include the Fed's
monthly bond purchases and its
guidance to investors about the
likely direction of rates.
Sen. Tim Johnson, D-S.D.,
who heads the Senate Bank-
ing, Housing and Urban Affairs
Committee, which must approve
Yellen's nomination, said he will
work with the panel's members
to advance her confirmation
quickly.
"She has a depth of experience
that is second to none, and I have
no doubt she will be an excel-

Solomon responded by rais-
ing more than $1,130 through
a private donation website -
most coming in from family and
friends of her team.
An additional $600 of
funding was granted by a
Central Student Government
resolution passed late Tues-
day night by a unanimous
vote. The resolution requires
attendees to present a report
to the assemblyonthe confer-
ence and further sustainabil-
ity initiatives the University
can pursue.
Results from the Power-
shift conference can be seen
on several U.S. campuses. The

"Divest and Invest" campaign
- which Solomon helped start
at the University - began just
two years ago after a workshop
hosted by two universities at
Powershift 2011.
According to Michigan's Stu-
dent Sustainability Coalition,
the University has almost $1
billion dollars invested in fossil
fuel industries, which accounts
for 5 percent of total fossil-fuel
investments fromU.S. universi-
ties.
In addition to "Divest and
Invest," this year's conference
will focus on environmental
justice, which is a growing part
of the environmental move-
ment.
"How our environment is
affecting the people - a lot of
time that is ignored in national

campaigns," Solomon said.
"People don't look at the peo-
ple aspect of 'it and that is so
important to motivate other
people."
The group initially reached
out to churches for lodging, but
many were already booked, and
others unwilling to accommo-
date.
"You don't want a bunch
of college students sleeping
on your floor when you're not
there and you have services to
run Sunday morning," she said.
"It's a big ask."
Solomon said she is opti-
mistic they will find friends
at nearby schools that can
squeeze 10 people on the floor,
and will consider couch-surfing
or camping, if it comes down to
it.

Federal inaction, local effects
The shutdown could have huge ramifications for higher education
T he current federal government shutdown - now in its second
week - is costing the state of Michigan about $18 million per day
according to the state's budget director. There have been many
"threats" and "warnings" from both parties, yet there appears to be no
end in sight. While there have been major repercussions across the board,
the shutdown has already induced huge ramifications for higher educa-
tion. If the shutdown continues, which very well may be the case, the
effects on University students could be astounding.

B eing an immature male and
a. self-identifying feminist
can be tough sometimes. I
mean, it's not
centuries-of-
oppression-
leading-to-
widespread-
economic-and-
social-discrim-
ination tough.
But still, as
someone who JAKE
strives to be an OFFENHARTZ
ally to all those
fighting misog-
yny-on the front
lines, I often find myself in trouble-
some moral quandaries.
What is my responsibility, for
example, ifa friend of mine cat-calls
a group of scantily clad sorority girls
outside of Rick's? What is my expect-
ed response to the "Bitch, make me
a sandwich" humor that still gets a
cheap laugh while watching foot-
ball? Duringmoments like this - fre-
quent as they are - is it my duty as
an Emma Goldman-loving, Jezebel-
reading male to halt the conversa-
tion, to condemn the comment as
sexist while debunking the myth that
all feminists hate men?
Regardless of whether or not
I have an obligation to speak out
against anti-women speech, I almost
never do. Admittedly, cowardice and
ignorance play a role in my silence,
as I am neither courageous nor
informed enough to intelligently
expound upon the ways in which
hate speech can contribute to often-
ignored gender inequalities. Even if I
were equipped with Mother Teresa's
bravery and Virginia Woolf's elo-
quence, I'd still be hesitant to assert
my feminist ideals in response to a
friend's demeaning language.
But, this has less to do with my
male-feminist identity than it does
with the fact that I - as a 20-year-
old with a juvenile sense of humor -
am sometimes a total shithead. Sure,

I make a conscious effort to avoid
the garden-variety misogyny that
plagues the vocabulary of some of my
peers, but in other respects I can be
narrow-minded and insensitive.
The truth of the matter is that
just as assholes can be feminists,
well-intentioned people sometimes
use sexist language to degrade
women. I'm not saying it's OK - it
totally isn't. I truly believe that
the seemingly harmless act of slut-
shaming girls outside a bar can
contribute to the victim-blaming
rhetoric that so harmfully pervades
our culture. That said, the moral
ground I currently stand on is sim-
ply not sturdy enough for me to feel
comfortable reprimanding a friend
for this all-too-common transgres-
sion. How then, do I define my role
as a male feminist?
For me, being a male feminist
means acknowledging that my
straight, male identity puts me at
place of enormous privilege in our
patriarchal society. It means rec-
ognizing that
societal con-
structions ofgen- There's n
der have led us
to falsely equate of Fem
hypermasculin-
ity with power can ca
and femininity
with weakness. Status
It means accept-
ing the fact that
words have the power to perpetu-
ate double standards - so that the
word "bitch" being synonymous
with both non-submissive women
and effeminate men is problematic.
Part of me, though, realizes it's
unfair to.expect everyone to know
or agree with these basic tenets
of feminist theory. Discussions
of social constructions and the
patriarchy take place in University
classrooms so that - just as privi-
lege begets privilege - privilege
also begets the study of oppression.
The part of me that realizes this is,

in many ways, responsible for my
rarely criticizing those who verbal-
ly encroach on my feminist ideals.
Therefore, the matters that I'm
passionate enough to espouse publi-
cally tend to be of the sort that any
basic egalitarian would be outraged
over. It's absolutely appalling to me
that one in four women will be vic-
tims of rape or attempted rape before
graduating college. It's embarrassing
that - 50 years after President John
F. Kennedy signed the Equal Pay
Act - women are still paid on aver-
age 77 cents for every dollar made
by men. It's more than unforgivable
that educated members of the media
think women breadwinners are anti-
science and it's a crying shame that
rich, old - uterus-less - men insist
on controlling the debate about abor-
tion. while feminism seeks to illumi-
nate these systematic discrepancies
as institution-based, the mere recog-
nition that all persons deserve equal-
ityisn't cause for radical association.
Do I deserve to call myself a
feminist then,
or is my self-
President identification
just some men-
inism IJ tal gymnastic
to exchange
ll for a accountability
for credibility?
report. The answer
to that ques-
tion remains
uncertain, as there's no President
of Feminism I can call for a status
report. In the meantime, here's
hoping our culture will one day
reject rigid gender norms and all
forms of subjugation, that unequal
pay will soon be a thing of the past
and rape statistics won't make me
wish my little sister would just go to
college online. When that day does
come, this petty matter of labeling
can finally be put to rest.

The federal government shutdown has
paused the U.S. Department of Education's
Office for Civil Rights' current investigations
of universities suspected ofviolating mandates
of Title IX - the federal gender equality law
- by mishandling of sexual violence on their
campuses. The processing of Clery Act com-
plaints - filed by students and faculty about
college's reporting of safety and security -
as well as follow-up on resolved complaints
and reforms in college policies have also been
halted. Crimes concerning sexual assault
are extremely time-sensitive issues, and not
addressing them in a prompt manner might
undo the steps that have been taken to make
collegiate handling of sexual violence more
transparent and fair.
Federal research funding has been stalled,
and all associated agencies have had to close
their doors. Federal scientists - deemed
nonessential - have had to drop their work,
meaning the large community of researchers
at academic institutions were forced to halt
their ongoing projects. The University itself
might see reduction in federal research as
federal sponsorship accounts for about 62 per-
cent of the University's total research volume.
Research projects funded through contracts
rather than grants, or awaiting federal regu-
latory approval, are on hold. The University
has also stalled the process for obtaining new
awards for research. In addition, many federal
electronic databases regularly used as schol-

arly resources in academic work and research
papers aren't being updated, including those
of the Library of Congress, the U.S. Census
Bureau, the National Science Foundation and
the Bureau of Economic Analysis at the U.S.
Department of Commerce.
Military service academies have also been
affected. Some immediate consequences
include shutdown of the U.S. Merchant Marine:
Academy in NewYork, along with classes being
cancelled at other academic institutions.At the
schools still holding classes, such as the Air
Force Academy, students can't access books at
the library, tutoring centers or resources from
the mediadue to cuts in academic sources. Here
at the University, the Gerald R. Ford Presiden-
tial Library on North Campus remains closed.
These serious impediments are, however,
fairly immediate - an elongated shutdown
could cause immense difficulties in numer-
ous other areas. The need-based Pell Grant
and federal student loans have been affected
- most of the employees overseeing the pro-
grams have been furloughed - making it dif-
ficult for recipientsto get answersto questions.
However, a longer shutdown could reduce
federal funding in this area. Federal funding
also goes beyond tuition for some college stu-
dents; food subsidies, grants and loans for stu-
dent housing all come from the government.
These disagreements must end to eliminate the
stranglehold on college students and the rest of
the American people.

How learned to be white

VICTORIA NOBLE . l
A student-friendly GOP

Critiques of the Republican Party haven't
been in short supply lately. Awkward sexist
gaffes - hello, legitimate rape - and a stub-
born government shutdown have led many'
to throw their hands up at the second largest
American political party. But, even though it
looks bad, the Grand Old Party isn't beyond
repair. If the party wants to win over tradi-
tionally liberal students - who have been
turning out to the polls in record numbers
- they have to ditch backward policies and
update their platform to accommodate a
changing world. Here are a few suggestions
to help the Republicans do just that.
First, stay out of our bedrooms. The "party
of personal freedom" has no business telling
us when we can or cannot use birth control or
who can marry whom. According to a study
by social work Assistant Prof. Michael Wood-
ford, 68 percent of heterosexual Michigan
students support same-sex marriage. Oppos-
ing equal rights has always put the offend-
ing party on the wrong side of history. If the
Republicans want any sort of resurgence
among students, they must reverse this trend
of ignorance and inequality.
Perhaps most pressingly, take charge of
the healthcare debate. Most Americans still
don't like the Affordable Care Act, or at least
don't fully support it. While it's great that
the ACA gives healthcare to more uninsured
Americans, the bill is still nothing more than
a Band-Aid fix. Until hospitals stop charging
insurance companies - and now the govern-
Ment - $70 for an antibiotic that costs six
cents to manufacture, the healthcare debate
will not end. If the Republican Party can
come up with a solution to do away with this
ridiculous inflation and lower healthcare
costs across the board, it will surely expand
their constituency.
But that means they must shut up and
compromise. According to Federalist Paper
10, a democracy is supposed to mediate
between different factions. By design of the
idolized founding fathers, the Republicans
can't get their way all the time. They'll need
to work with the - gasp! - liberal agenda if
they expect the liberals to work with theirs.
Maybe they'll even stop a few government
shutdowns in the process.
Next, stop being sexist. Most Republican
politicians don't want to marginalize women,
but sometimes that's what their policies do.

Common-sense policies such as equal rights
and pay shouldn't be divided by partisan
politics. They also need to leave the abortion
issue alone. No legislator has the power to do
anything about Roe v. Wade. The Republi-
cans would be wise to ignore this issue and
spend their political capital elsewhere.
This capital would be best spent playing
to their strength - the economy. Polls con-
sistently show that more Americans trust the
Republicans to handle the economy. Repub-
licans need to stop fighting with Democrats
over social issues and work on ways to reform
the many government structures that inhibit
economic growth.
And they can do that by working the media.
The Democrats frequently play the "cool kid"
card by appearing on talk shows and new
media outlets frequently visited by students.
The Republicans rarely, if ever, appear on
non-traditional news. sources - as in, any-
thing but Fox News. Some of President Ron-
ald Reagan's success can be attributed to his
ability to use media to his advantage. Instead
of complaining about media bias, modern
Republicans need to use new media sources
to change their stuffy public image.
And lastly, Republicans need to sup-
port education. Education is a capital good
with strong spillover benefits. Good schools
can singlehandedly reduce crime, reduce
income disparity without having to redistrib-
ute wealth and ensure long-term economic
growth by investing in future laborers, lead-
ers, professionals and capitalists. There's
absolutely no excuse for the Republicans
not to support every effort to improve edu-
cation and education funding at all levels.
Strong primary and secondary schools give
students a solid foundation for later work
and education. Strong public universities
help get promising impoverished students
into quality institutions. The students then
often go back to their original hometowns or
cities and elicit real change for those areas.
It's clear that meaningful education can do
,more to solve social disparity than other fed-
eral programs ever could. It could also reduce
welfare dependence.
These goals could legitimize the Republi-
can Party and make it slightly more attractive
to younger generations.
Victoria Noble is.an LSA freshman.

At birth, I entered the lifelong
process of blindly learning what
it means to be white. Life coaches
bestowed the notion of whiteness in
me - my parents, peers, teachers,
institutions, media, song lyrics, legal
system, schools and countless oth-
ers. Through an unspoken process of
socialization, I have learned how to
be white.'
At just four months old, my par-
ents left a country filled with blood-
shed, hatred and nationalism in the
hopes of finding a utopia called
America. Instead, they found the
same deathly and suffocating grip
choking the people of the United
States. It was no longer just religion
that simply divided people: It was
race. *
At age two, my parents were
already socialized by American
society which included adopting
the notion of separation and oppres-
sion along racial divides. They soon
learned that this country was quick
to assume, doubt, ignore, belittle,
torture and deny based on the color
of one's skin. Now, America looks
onto Bosnia and its civil war as a
senseless affair between ignorant
barbarians.
Bold statement from a country
with a similar history.
At age five, Ruby and I were
lumped together in preschool,
because our teacher assumed that
her non-white dialect and my non-
English accent went well together
and made us equally un-American.
At age seven, I desperately wanted
my hair to be braided with pink clips
and beads on the ends, but an unspo-

ken and uncomfortable exchange
between my mother and the hair-
dresser ensued that proved silent
resistance could be overlooked in
order to appropriate someone else's
culture.
At age eight, my parents climbed
the social ladder and moved away
from the poor inner city.
At age eight and a half, my parents
started to lock their car doors when
they wandered back to their old
neighborhood.
At age nine, my whitewashed
town grew afraid of others after 9/11.
At age 10, my father pointed out
the factories piled in Detroit and
told me that all I would have to do
in order to avoid the assembly line
would be to work hard in school.
At age 12, the evening news
showed white individuals and lumps
of color.
At age 13, I learned the world his-
tory of white conquerors and saviors
who acquired God's duty to spread
civilization to the rest of the world.
At age 14,I moved to a rich, white
area to go to a better school, and soon
learned to ignore the too-close-for-
comfort "ghetto" separated by an
invisible border of high taxes.
At age 15, the cool kids in high
school bonded over creating their
own racial slur.
At age 16, my role models included
all of my teachers at school - all of
them white.
At age 17, I let my head bob to the
rhythm of lyrics and beats produced
by a different race: by a different
world ridden by a struggle I will
never experience.

At age 18, I watched the masses
of my affluent white peers receive
academic awards while the handful
of black students received athletic
awards.
At the University, I thought the
campus was very diverse and wel-
coming.
At the University, my he'artbeat
quickened when a black man was
walking towards me at night.
At the University, my slight accent
attracted inquisitive comments, and
my response of being born in Bosnia
made me seem interesting and cool
while immigrants of color received
snickers and were negatively regard-
ed as "fresh off the boat."
At the University, my white guilt
drove me to smile excessively at peo-
ple of color as they walked by.
At the University, no one demand-
ed that I speak without an accent,
while others rolled their eyes when a

A Lennon tribute
concert for peace

Local artists to
present peace-
themed music
By GRACE PROSNIEWSKI
Daily Arts Writer
Few artists have so influenced
and inspired people to work
toward societal change as John
Lennon. From
his days with Veterans
The , Beatles, For Peace
through his solo
work until his John Lennon
death in 1980, Birthday
Lennon was
an iconic and Concert

As his
73rd birthday The Ark
approaches,
fans of Lennon. $15
have an oppor-
tunity to celebrate his life and
ideals while supporting a worthy
cause. The sixth annual "Veterans
for Peace John Lennon Birthday
Concert," put on by the Veterans
for Peace Chapter 93, features sev-
eral local artists, who will perform
a wide array of Lennon's works
and other peace-related songs.
For the first event held in Ypsi-
lanti's Corner Brewery, Chapter
President Bob Krzewinski con-
tacted Yoko Ono's people in New
York and asked to use John Len-
non's name for the peace event.
About a month later, the chapter
receiveda$10,000 checkfromOno
in support of the event.
The concert continued to grow

and develop fromthenon,so much
so thatorganizers decided to move
it to abigger venue.
"The biggest change made to
the event was moving it last year
from the Corner Brewery to The
Ark," said Chapter Vice-Coordi-
nator William Shea. "The Brewery
was a free place, while The Ark
cost significantly more. But at the
Corner we had to get the sound
system, lights, set up publicity, etc.
But at The Ark, that's all taken care
of Plus, because of the size of The
Ark, there's the potential to make,
or lose, a bit more money."
The event promises to be a
thoughtful forum on combating
acts of war and systematic vio-
lence through peaceful means.
"The concert," Shea said,
"serves two purposes: to raise
money for the Utah Phillips/J.
David Singer Chapter of Vet-
erans For Peace's Peace Schol-
arship Fund, a fund that has
supported 10 college students
who are studying conflict reso-
lution, be it in a single course,
a degree-granting program or
research-dissertation work, and
to get like-minded peace activ-
ists together to celebrate peace
efforts throughout the world."
Thecriterionforreceivingdona-
tions from the event has changed
to accommodate more candidates
in different concentrations.
"The award system has been
opened up," Shea said, "to
include almost any Michigan
resident who is studying con-
flict resolution and has a need
for funds to accomplish their
activities and goals. We've given
out as little as $250 for a small,

one-time project to as much as
$5,000 for financial assistance
on a major dissertation project."
Lennon's aggressive activism
against war serves as an inspi-
ration for others who believe in
peace to act on their beliefs.
"Lennon was a militant paci-
fist," Shea said. "He knew full
well that you often have to get in
warmongers' faces to get them to
pay attention to the fundamental
destruction onthe lives and psyche
of those affected by war and con-
flict."
The call for peace is especially
poignant when coming from vet-
erans, men and women who have
experienced the brutality of war
firsthand and who refuse to let
such atrocities continue unchal-
lenged.
"I am a Vietnam-era vet and
when I meet younger vets, we
often understand that the wars
we've been in may be from a dif-
ferent time, but in reality there is
no difference between one war
and another," Shea said. "A war is
a war, be it World War II, Korea,
Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan. The
destruction on all is the same, the
(post-traumatic stress disorder)
is the same, the dehumanizing
effect on both military and civil-
ian participants is the same, the
hatred is the same."
With all the recent discussion
about taking military action in
Syria, Lennon's message of giv-
ing peace a chance is as relevant
today as ever.
"War seems to be the first
solution by many," Shea said,
"when truly it should never be
considered a solution at all."

Reich wants to tell you about
one of the biggest economic and

you're probably going to listen
to him - and not just because

In director Jacob Kornbluth's
("The Best Thief in the World")
latest documentary, Reich talks
to the audience about the wid-
ening income inequality in the
United States and the effect
that it has on society. His story
begins with America's economy

on the original
vampire fam-
ily; we've seen their whole sor-
did story in repeated flashbacks
since "TVD" season two. In the
new premiere, "The Originals"
had to work around this previ-
ous knowledge while providing
enough token exposition for new-
comers to gain a shaky foothold.
To get around this, the series
essentially recycles the previ-
ously aired pilot, but reworks the
unfolding events through Elijah's
(Daniel Gillies) point of view.
While it's not oh-shit-what-is-
going-on exciting like a top-of-
its-game episode of "TVD," the
premiere manages to get all of its
ducks in a row with a satisfying
amount of shifty looks and secret
meetings to heighten suspense.
As if we haven't been waiting on
the edge of our seats for months
now.
Elijah, while a supremely bor-
ing character in "TVD," makes
an excellent 'narrator here. We
find out even more twisty details
about his rocky relationship with
Klaus (Joseph Morgan) and see
him get a little too up-close-
and-personal with Klaus's -baby
mama, Hayley (Phoebe Tonkin).
Turns out starchy, proper Eli-
jah is human (well ... you know
what I mean) after all. Props to
"The Originals" for handling the
whole hybrid baby thing without
delving into "Twilight" territory
- though the super prolonged
pause to hear the heartbeat was
toeing the line.
While "TVD" isn't completely
forgotten - there's a shoutout or

After hot start, reality check
at Erin Hills Collegiate

Michigan finishes
eighth out of 14 at
Wisconsin course
By MICHAEL KESSLER
Daily Sports Writer
Two top-three finishes to
start the season for the Michi-
gan men's golf team was an
ideal start, especially coming
off a disheartening last sea-
son. The talented sophomore
duo of Chris O'Neill and Brett
McIntosh was off to a fantastic
start, leading a young Wolver-
ine squad that looked poised to
compete for the Big Ten cham-
pionship.
Those expectations haven't
evaporated by any stretch, but
a disappointing performance
at the Erin Hills Collegiate
may give those aspirations a
sobering pause. The Wolver-
ines fell back to reality with an
eighth-place finish this week
in Hartford, Wis., shooting a
29-over-par 893.
Though Michigan started
relatively well, shooting its
best round of the tournament
in the first round and finishing
the day in sixth place, it slipped
to eighth after a rough second
round on Monday that was ham-
pered by strong, gusty winds.
Scores across the board spiked
in the round, but despite an
improved final round, the Wol-
verines were unable to make
up any ground and settled for
eighth place in the 14-team field.
"We were capable of bet-
ter," said Michigan coach Chris
Whitten. "The golf course was
challenging and was really
penalizing poor shots. This will
leave a little bit of a bad taste in
our mouths."

For the No. 10 Michigan hock-
ey team, Thursday night's home
opener against No. 4 Boston Col-
lege just got even more daunting.
Coming off a losing season in
which the Wolverines missed the
NCAA tournament for the first
time in 23 years, the pressure will
no doubt be on in Yost Ice Arena
for Michigan's first regular-sea-
son matchup.
To make mat- NOTEBOOK
ters worse, this
young team will skate without
junior forward Alex Guptill, who
will serve a team-sanctioned sus-
pension, on Thursday before he
returns to the lineup Saturday
against Rochester Institute of
Technology.
Last season, Guptill led the
Wolverines in nearly every offen-
sive category with 36 points, 16
goals, 144 shots and three game-
wining goals.
A third-round draft pick by
the Dallas Stars in 2010, Guptill
also finished second behind then-
freshman forward Boo Nieves in
assists and power-play goals.
After Guptill sat out the exhibi-
tion game Sunday, Michigan coach
Red Berenson announced Tues-
day that he would miss the home
opener as a result of an undis-
closed incident that occurred over
the summer.
"It just happened to be a big
game," Berenson said. "This isn't
something I like, but it's the right
thing to do. It's not something he
likes either. It's a big game, it's a
home game and it's a tough game

to win."
Guptill stayed in Ann Arbor
for an away series in December
against Ferris State lastseason due
to a similar incident. But for the
time being, Berenson isn't worried
about a pattern of behavior.
"I'm seeing more (maturity)
now," Berenson said. "That'sgood.
So we're making headway."
Without Guptill on Sunday,
Michigan managed 35 shots
against 22 for Waterloo - a sign
the offense is as strong as prom-
ised. But the Wolverines went
0-for-5 on power plays - one of
Guptill's specialties. The offense
will have to convert on extra-man
opportunities against the mighty
Boston College defense to prevent
playingfrombehind.
SWITCHING IT UP: Nine of
Michigan's 10 freshmen saw time
on the ice in Sunday's exhibition.
Despite a strong showing
both offensively and defensively,
Berenson favors familiar pairs on
offense heading into the regular
season. He expects to put Nieves
back with junior Phil Di Guiseppe
and partner freshmen JT Com-
pher and Tyler Motte in an effort
to increase power-play conver-
sions.
"I just didn't see enough of the
lines that I think we can do bet-
ter with so we just made.a couple
of changes," Berenson said. "I'm
interested to see how three of our
lines jell. We have a lot of young
players, and you're looking for that
young player to do what you need."
On defense, Michigan's pen-
alty kill, which featured three
freshmen, was near perfect
against Waterloo. While fresh-

men Michael Downing and Kevin
Lohan looked particularly strong,
Berenson is uncertain as to which
to lineswill appear infrontofBos-
ton College's trio of top scorers.
Berenson plans to keep the
three freshmen defensemen on
their respective lines Thursday.
AN EYE ON TROUBA: For-
mer Michigan defenseman Jacob
Trouba seems to have settled in
nicely into his new home in Win-
nipeg, Man.
Troubamadehis NHL debut for
the Jets last Tuesday, contributing
one goal and one assist.
In a single year at Michigan,
Trouba netted 12 goals and 17
assists en route to a first team
All-American selection. As a
freshman, Trouba led all fresh-
men defensemen nationally, con-
tributing six power play goals.
The Rochester, Mich., native was
named Michigan's Hal Downs
Most Valuable Player and first-
team all-CCHA, while winning a
gold medal with the U.S. National
Junior Team at the 2013 IIHF
World Junior Championship in
Russia.
As former teammates, senior
captain defenseman Mac Bennett
and junior alternate captain for-
ward Andrew Copp were watch-
ing on Tuesday.
"I played with him last year,"
Bennett said. "He's a very special
player. You could seethat last year.
Obviously he's ready for the next
level, and he played like nothing's
changed."
Added Copp: "Topping Mac, I
played with Trouba for nine years.
He's a confident kid, and those sit
uations don't bug him at all"

By LIZ VUKELICH
Daily Sports Editor
When offensive coordinator Al
Borges first saw Graham Glasgow
in 2011, he was skeptical that the
offensive lineman would ever play
in Michigan Stadium.
Glasgow, now a redshirt sopho-
more, was all over the place as a
tackle his freshman year, running
into teammates and unaware of
when to block. Borges doubted
Glasgow would ever reach a high
enough caliber to be on the field
for a snap, let alone a start.
It wasn't just Glasgow's con-
fusion during practice that made
Borges hesitant about putting him
in the lineup - it was the fact that
Glasgow, a walk on, was compet-
ing against his highly recruited,
scholarship-worthy teammates,
not just for a chance to play, but
for the coaches' attention.
"It's a credit to a walk-on kid to
get in the starting lineup because
he's done something to get you
thinking he can play," Borges said.
Glasgow talks about the coach-
ing hierarchy in the eyes of a
walk-on, the list of people that
needed to take notice before he

could makethe jumpto being seri-
ously considered to play in games.
He had already caught the eye of
the strength coaches, so next on
the list of people to impress was
offensive line coach Darrell Funk.
But that was already taken care
of: fifth-year senior left tackle
Taylor Lewan was acting as a sort
of liaison, casually bringing up
Glasgow's name in front of Funk
as a younger guy who stood out.
So after seeing Glasgow strug-
gling at both the tackle and guard
positions, Funk gave him center
duties in practice last fall to see if
he fared any better there.
Finally, it was Borges's turn
to pay attention, after the spring
game of Glasgow's freshman year.
He "wasn'tgoing to take the world
by storm" at the time, said Borges,
but the extra time Glasgow spent
in the weight room during the off-
season paid off.
"(Glasgow) worked hard and
... it's important to him," Borges
said. "That's all a coach asks. If it's
important to you, you do all the
right things to get you as good as
you can be. If that's good enough
to play, then great."
Now, two years later, Glasgow

is a self-made lineman. He was
awarded a scholarship at the
beginning of the season, and after
starting the first four games at left
guard,he moved over to center for
the Big Ten opener last weekend.
He's been one of Michigan's most'
reliable interior linemen, which is
why the coaches had no qualms
about changing his position a
week before the game.
After the Minnesota game,
Lewan said Glasgow plays bet-
ter with a full plate, that the
increased multitasking and
heightened sense of responsibil-
ity make him a better fit at center
than at guard.
Glasgow agreed with the
assessment, rationalizing' it by
saying that the number of things
there are to keep track of dur-
ing games keeps him from get-
ting complacent now that he's
achieved both scholarship and
starter status.
"One good performance isn't
going to change their perspec-
tive," Glasgow said. "There's
always that mentality you always
need to work hard even if you've
been given something. You need
to still prove them right."


Freshman running back Derrick Green had his workload increased in Michigan's win over Minnesota on Saturday.

Waiting in the wings is Michi-
gan's No. 2 tailback, freshman
Derrick Green, whom Borges
described as "a load" during his
Tuesday press conference. And
that's the perfect way to describe
the top-ranked running back in
the high-school class of 2013.
Green's former coach at Her-
mitage (Va.) High School, Pat-
rick Kane, burst out laughing
upon hearing Borges's assess-
ment.

evident than late in the game
against the Golden Gophers,
when the coaching staff put the
ball in Green's hands and trusted
he wouldn't fumble.
Playing second fiddle to Tous-
saint isn't something Green is
accustomed to, though Kane, his
high-school coach, called him
a "team guy," adding that indi-
vidual stats have never mattered
much to him.
Kane said Michigan was the

a talented kid like that, there's
nothing wrong with that. But I'll
never put a number on how many
carries he's got to have."
Borges called Green a "work
in progress," which is to be
expected for a freshman, even
one who came in as highly tout-
ed as Green. But as the coaches
become more comfortable with
him, his carries will come, and
they'll be in key situations when
the team needs yards.

Wednesday, Octcber 9, 20 !,' The Statement

letter from the editor
These are yours, ours, everyone's statements. This issue
is filled with stories about life's experiences that resonat-
ed in our souls, so much that we had to put them on our
pages. Writing can be a cathartic process, a way to wrestle
through emotions, a moment to gain more understanding
and - if we're lucky - peace. I was lucky enough to read
through many stories and see those moments of clarity.
But I was also entrusted to select only six personal state-
ments for these pages. Some are funny, some are sad, but
all are the reality. One personal statement is published in
The Statement regularly, but this week, we dedicate the
issue to those moments where you speak to us.

44 ey, gorgeous."
It's been three and ahalfyears
since Papa died, but I can still
hear his familiar, embarrass-
ing greeting. He came to my house almost every day
when I was growing up, and the greeting was a tradi-
tion that had sprung up over the years. He'd walk in
and say his hello, and I'd run over and give him a hug,
blushing. After, we would sit in the family room and
watch the Tigers game or Michigan football together.
It may not seem like much, but it's one of the
things I miss most about him.
Papa Henry, my father's father, was ahard worker,
fiercely loyal to family and, above all, he was kind. In
the almost 18 years I got to spend with him, I never
once heard him say something negative or hurtful
about someone.
He was a good man, and he made me a better
person.
Papa was a joker, constantly making us all laugh,
even if we had heard the joke once or twice before.
He was a favorite among friends and strangers alike.
He loved crossword puzzles, and he fell asleep every
time he picked upa book.
On days when I thought the world was out to get
me, he was my ally, comforting me when the tears
wouldn't stop. And when I felt insecure, Papa was
there with a bologna and mustard sandwich, ready-
to make it better.
He had a big heart, and he filled it with family. My
grandma was the love of his life, and they had a mar-
riage any couple would be lucky to have. He raised
both of his sons to be respectful and kind. From
driving my cousin, D.J., to school each morning, to
sitting through every last one of my dance recitals,
he loved each of his grandchildren unconditionally,
and continuously showed it.
The memories, of course, are endless. But my
favorites revolve around our annual family trip to
Traverse City, We were all on different schedules,
but every year we set aside time for the Family Vaca-
tion because Papa wanted us all together. Truthfully,
the games of putt-putt, rounds of go-carts, family
softball games and sand castle-building competi-
tions are some of the best times my family has had
together. We still go to Traverse City every year, and
we still have a great time, though his sunburnt feet
are noticeably absent.
Papa was a family man, but he was also one of
the biggest sports fans I've ever known. Base-

ball was his game, but he loved Michigan athlet-
ics, too. My first game at the Big House, I was
sandwiched between him and my dad, trying
to learn the chants as I reveled in the glory of
Michigan football.
Admittedly, I don't remember if we won or lost
that game. But I do remember Papa let me bor-
row his Maize and Blue cap to keep the sun out
of my eyes.
He loved Michigan, but Papa didn't go to college.
He had ten brothers and sisters, and his parents just
couldn't afford it.
when I was growing up, Nana and Papa would
bring over bags and bags of presents every Christ-
mas for their four - and eventually five - grandchil-
dren. When Papa was a child, the Salvation Army
brought him a pair of shoes every December.
Buthe, and Nanaworked incrediblyhard and sent
both of their children to college. In that regard, Papa
is the epitome of the American Dream. He worked
tirelessly, painting houses and eventually working
for General Motors, so he could give his family what
he himself never had. For his children, it meant that
they would receive a college education.
For me, it meant a college degree from the Uni-
versity of Michigan, specifically. My family has bled
Maize and Blue for generations. Michigan was my
dream - and Papa was my biggest supporter.
So growing up, I studied hard, I played sports, I
joined clubs andI watched every Michigan game with
my family on TV.I sang "The Victors" with the rest of
my family when my sister was accepted in 2008, and
I explored the campus with her, wide-eyed, counting
down the days until I could join her in Ann Arbor.
Everything was running smoothly, until it wasn't.
Papa passed away two weeks before my high-school
graduation. It happened so quickly, we didn't get to
say goodbye, and Papa never knew that my dream of
attending the University would come true. I trans-
ferred here in my sophomore year.
It wasn't fair, but that's how it went.
At the time, it felt like I lost my best friend. Some-
times, it still does. Almost four years later, I still cry
when I try to talk about him. Writing helps.
When I graduate from the University this May, I
know Papa won't be in the Big House with me. But
I know how proud he would be of me, and I'm so
thankful for the 18 years I got to spend with him.

ot many people are able to say they
held the distinction of being stu-
dent council president. Far fewer
can say they ascended to that position in
the fourth grade because, well, how many
elementary schools have a stu-
dent council?
But I can say, with near
certainty, that I was the only
grade-school politician to have
been brought down by a water-
gate-esque scandal - the likes
of which Cincinnati's Maple
Dale Elementary. had never
seen before.
Yes, that's right. I was
impeached as student coun-
cil president before I had even
reached middle school. My
political career was over before
it truly began. Had it not ended
so abruptly, maybe I wouldn't
have chosen a career as a politi-
can's best friend and worst
enemy - a journalist. Perhaps
I'd have stuck with politics and,
you know, actually made money
the rest of my life.
But I digress. Back to that
fateful day at recess.Â°
It was a beautiful fall Mid-
western day, and my term
as president could not have
been going any better. The
year before, I began my politi-
cal career as vice president
but quickly rose to top dog
with a coup that would make
even Frank Underwood from
"House of Cards" green with
envy. Either that, or the kid
who Ihad served under passed fourth grade
and moved on to middle school. You choose.
Approval ratings were high. I success-
fully strong-armed the cafeteria ladies

me.). On rainy days, during indoor recess,
I made good on my campaign promise of a
copy of "Oregon Trail" in every classroom.
But it all came crashing down faster than
all of my "Oregon Trail" characters could
contract cholera.
The end of my presidency began, like all
political demises do, with a game of kick-
ball.
I was an above-average, if unspectacular,
athlete in that day, long before I switched
from playing sports to writing about them.
Later in life, I would score a left-footed slid-
ing goal to send a playoff soccer game into
overtime before celebrating a la Brandi
Chastain. I'd knock down 3-pointer after
3-pointer to defeat the local Jewish day
school (a basketball. powerhouse at the

time) in a shooting display that came from the bases, probably jawing at the pitcher ifI obstacles, who I'll call Charlotte.

next words came out of the
principal's mouth.
The mother and daugh-
ter were alleging that a
classmate had paid me $3
in exchange for kicking the
ball in the general direction
of the girls - in essence, a
playground hit on an inno-
cent child.
I was appalled. I wasn't
sure which part of the tfdi-
crous accusation to debunk
first. The idea that I, non-
violent by nature, could
be bought so cheaply, still
offends me to this day.
It was around this time
when the principal informed
me that this kind of conduct
was not appropriate for the
student council president
and, because of that, I would
be removed from that posi-
tion. So she didn't actor'
use the word impeached.
Whatever. We both knew
what this was.
There were tears. Surely,
this had nothing to do with
Charlotte's mother's role as
PTO president which, in
those days, apparently
meant something other than
AN MULHOLLAND she had a little too much time
on her hands.
My mom, on the other hand, was livid,
as I later found out. She-knew her son was
incapable of intentionally harming anyone,
let alone a girl. I faked sick on the day we
dissected worms in biology class, for crying
out loud.
Not to mention, my aim simply isn't that
good. Sometimes I can't even hit the toilet
bowl. There's no way that I could accurately
place a kickball so far away. If I could, I'd
have homered every time, and I'd probably
be a professional kickball player, if such a
thing exists.
In hindsight, I should have demanded to
see the X-rays. Was that finger actually b
ken? But it shouldn't even matter.
What does matter is that I recently
Facebook stalked her, having not seen her
since shortly after the incident. Let's just
say she's not not attractive. I wonder if she
holds a grudge .

ers who covered the school's sprawling
blacktop, could've possibly been prepared
for what was about to occur.
Standing about 15 feet behind the center
fielder was a group of fourth-grade girls,
who severely underestimated my ability to
kick a ball. They were chatting and general-
ly paying no mind to the fact that they were
in fair territory of a kickball game between
third and fourth graders, which felt like the
Super Bowl if the players in the Super Bowl
had little to no athletic ability.
The pitcher delivered a slow roller, with
minimal spin, just a few inches off the plate
- in other words, right in my wheelhouse.
I began striding toward the incoming ball
and made perfect contact with the top of
my foot. The ball soared out of the infield
and over the head of the center fielder, who
played me far too shallow.
You probably see where this is going.
Unfortunately, the gabbing girls in deep
center didn't. I wasn't able to see what hap-
pened next. I was triumphantly rounding

with one of the unsuspecting girls' hands.
And apparently, I struck the kickball with
enough force to break one of her fingers.
The next thing I remember is being
dragged (not literally - Maple Dale Ele-
mentary, to its credit, does not condone
corporal punishment) into the principal's
office the following day during recess.
Now this was not my first encounter with
the principal's office, nor would it be my
last. That would come senior year of high
school when my cell phone was snatched
away for texting in class. The message I
was composing? Informing my dad that I
had been accepted to Michigan. By then, I
had developed a reputation as a bit of a class
clown, and I'd come to realize that the walk
to the principal's office was a necessary evil
for me to continue to have my fun.
As I sat down, the principal calmly
explained to me that the previous day's
kickball homer, the pinnacle of my school-
yard athletic career, had resulted in a bro-
ken pointer finger for one of the center-field

Wednesday, October 9, 2013 // The Statement E3

A Letter to My Freshman Self: How
you're using your English degree
by Carmen Allen

3 a.m., welcome week.
by Jon Horford

Iwould tell you that all the hours you're spending
researching requirements for Columbia's English doc-
toral program is a waste of time, but as it marks your
first real practice in collecting and evaluating information,
a process that will become all too familiar to you, I'll let
you be.
You won't transition to a Ph.D. immediately after under-
grad but will abandon the idea altogether, entertaining
thoughts of law school and volunteer work before you
finally settle on corporate America. Thirty-seven days
after your cap-and-gown-clad exit from the Big House,
ynJ1 don a blazer and skirt for your first day as a manage-
ment trainee on Long Island. You will work for Slomin's,
the nation's largest privately-owned home security and
residential heating oil company, and your hands-on expo-
sure to the company's operations will include shadowing
alarm mechanics, HVAC technicians, oil drivers and sales
representatives in between table sessions with department
heads and executives.
By May 4, you'll be ready for a world without coursework
and academic politics. A month into the real world, part of
you will be starved for Ann Arbor's intellectual life, but the
other part will be relieved that you're no longer volleying
jargon around a classroom in theoretical discussions about
s ectionality. Instead, you'll be watching it.
- Over the next four years, you will minimize "access to
education" to juveniles in Highland Park detention facili-
ties and will blink when you see its evidence in the oil driv-
ers, and mechanics that speak and interact so differently'
than your classmates and friends.
When you shadow a sales representative, more substan-
tial discussions will replace small talk as you drive from
one sales call to the next. You'll talk religion and theo-
ries of political advocacy and family and work-life bal-
ance, everything the professional workplace deems taboo
because it fears the abrasion with which the parties might
speak. But you'll talk delicately, no longer the freshman
who huffs out sentences to make.her case. You are not so
naive to believe that an employee's worldview won't affect
his work experiences.
How can you manage if you don't know what's going on
in your employees' lives? How can you communicate if you
don't know your audience?
And through these discussions you'll learn that this
audience doesn't listen harder when you throw around
words like 'dichotomy' and 'disseminate.' It takes humility
to release everything you learned, the vocabulary so care-
fully honed, the value of a degree reduced to your ability
to converse with people without one. Within the first two
weeks on the job, when you help Mechanic 292 snake wires
through walls, handing him crimps and screwdrivers and
'L'stepladder, you'll find that field workers won't open up
when they think you're a snobby college grad.
You'll see it in the way they talk about education. One
technician will tell you, "You don't need to be in the office.
You'll make more money as an oil mechanic." Conversations
with department heads about raises and bonuses will show
you the complications of that statement, but English 325
as taught you that perception is everything. Field workers
might shy away from giving you information, afraid that
you'll report them or that you might be their boss someday.

And you might.
So you cultivate relationships to benefit your future self
who in one, five, ten years from now can reflect with satis-
faction on the beginning of your career.
"Do you think people are inherently good or bad?" you
ask Mechanic 292 during a lunch break overlooking the
Atlantic. You talk about crime and anarchy, bouncing
between his thoughts on a recent movie and your analy-
sis of Native Son. He finds your crime and justice minor
fascinating and asks about your classes, turning the
discussion to the topic of autonomy. At the end of your
rotation with him, he'll thank you for the conversations,
and you'll carry the experience to department heads in a
debriefing about employee treatment and company cul-
ture. You note that the field workers value managements'
interest in the day-to-day grind mechanics and drivers

undergo: this is Marx's ironic but comfortable niche in
the capitalist world.
What you love about English you will find in the real
world. It will begin in classroom discussions that grow
heated as you befriend characters and evaluate their choic-
es. It will continue outside of the classroom, when you will
compare literary theory to managing a student organiza-
tion. And it will culminate in .your senior year, when you
find that your thesis on transactional relationships in Dick-
ens is not terribly dissimilar to the corporate America for
which you are preparing. The value of an English degree is
more than honors on a thesis, more than a B.A. on a resume.
It's preparing you for a career in management because it's
teaching you how relationships work.
Contrary to popular belief, contrary to your own
thoughts at this point, a liberal arts degree will not pre-
pare you solely for a lifetime in academia but for success

in the real world as well. You'll notice it in your colleagues'
comments on how well you articulate and in your abil-
ity to facilitate communication between the president and
department heads. You'll see it in the ease with which you
can identify the larger picture. You'll identify it in the ways
your language classes are contributing to your thoughts on
improving cross-company communication.
This is how you will come to see it: You can't have an
oil delivery without a sale. And you can't have a sale with-
out marketing. And you can't have effective marketing if
you don't understand how aesthetics appeal to people. And
you can't understand the effect of aesthetics if you don't
know how people work. And when the vice president says,
"We're proud to view customers as people, not account
numbers," you know that the liberal arts taught him that.
Because the customer is first a purchaser, who .is first a
homeowner, who is first a part of humanity - and it is his
human desires you are satisfying when you talk about good
customer service, an attempt to make the face of a company
a human-to-human interaction. How do you have a relation-
ship with a service?.
You'll discover that defamiliarization makes a good mar-
keting technique. When discussing Photoshop effects with
one of the programmers, you'll know this is what literary
theorist Shklovsky said, in more words, perhaps, about
what makes the stone stony, now applied to the visual. The
programmer wants to zoom and crop, showing only a sec-

In a discussion with the president of the company about
a banner photo on the new website, you defend your choice
of a couple snuggled against each other, dessert in hand,
a wintry window behind them. You'll claim, "We're not
selling a product, we're selling an experience. Home heat-
ing means intimacy." You'll situate yourself as the liaison
between the marketing team's vision and the program-
mers' fixation on coding the mobile site. Throw in a cyni-
cal image management guru and you'll realize you walked
into a character-driven plot that will define your corporate
experience. So you navigate the personality minefield to
talk about language in a website copy discussion. What is
home security, anyway?
The longer you are in corporate America, the more
you will realize how dependent it is on the liberal arts.
Your business classes will teach you what a transaction
is. Your friends' engineering classes will teach them how
to make it more efficient. But the humanities will tell
you why it happens.
As for you, you'll question everything in debriefing ses-
sions with department heads and executives. Your col-
leagues laugh at your inquisition and might let a snarky
comment slide when you press deeper into an answer, all
stemming from your acute observations in the field.
But when the vice president of sales and marketing
approaches you and says, "I hear you're doing a good job,"
you'll smile.
You have four years of participation points to thank for that.

watching three couples engage
in the college version of a mating ritual.
One couple is sitting on the couch to my

a respectable amount of time in between
meeting and making the "beast with two

of whatever it is you were raised to think
your mind should be focued on. A few more
shots of shitty tasting liquid should help
but if you really want to test your tolerance
for certain situations, throw your sober
self at the nearest bar around 1:30 a.m. and
observe what a sense of "community" has
become. Not that I don't partake in said
activities on a weekly basis, but somewhere
between a group of 10 good friends texting
silently in a living room pregame and con-
versations starting only after your breath
becomes flammable, I have to draw the line.
How many times has your pride stopped
you from doing what you want because you.
didn't want to feel weak or stupid? You had,
to maintain this image of yourself that you

thought other people would be willing to
accept because ultimately, what's worse.in
life than being alone and feeling like you
don't belong? You could have every trea-
sure the world can offer but if you could
only use those treasures for yourself, what
worth would they truly have? The bottom
line is that everyone wants to be loved in
some way. This might sound lazy, but let's

be attained if you have your thoughts and
beliefs at a certain frequency. I'm not here
to tell you what is best or what you should
do; do what feels right to you and under-
stand that not knowing and not being sure
is the way it is and will be for everyone. Our
journeys are different so don't base yours
off of comparisons to others. Begin to enjoy
everything that happens to you. Will old

your decisions. The act of not doubting is
strength. Believe in yourself and you will
accomplish anything. And when you have
become the person you had dreamed of
becoming, remember this: no matter how
many "great" things you accomplish in your
life, you are no better than a person who has
done what society would consider "noth-

Losing It
by Paige Pearcy

He asked me if I was squeamish.
"No," I paused a second longer
than I should have. "No, I'm not," I
finished.
"Alright, be here at eight," he said. "I'll
have the saw all ready to go."
When I pulled myself out of bed at 7 a.m.
the next morning, my eyes were still sol-
dered shut with the dreams of my four-hour
slumber. I reached my arms
above me, let out a yawn and
accepted that I really had to
go. Pigs were waiting.
I wondered why some-
one would choose to be a
butcher. And I wondered
even more why I chose to
spend my morning learning
about what they did. Being
a butcher was not on my
career list in the slightest.
And yet my intrigue as a self-
proclaimed foodie propelled
my curiosity.
When I reached the meat
counter, heads of three pigs
greeted me like my Barbies
do when I venture into my
childhood toy box - decapi-
tated.
Attached to the ceiling
above us, dried prosciutto
chunks, hams'and various
other meats hung with tags
tied by twine, reading "Not
for sale." The hanging meats
looked far less appetizing in
appearance than the marbled pinks, reds and
whites that collaged the case in front; they
were dried out, browning and had crumbles
from their breakdown dusting their exterior
- the epitome of dry-aged.
I watched the team ,of two butchers
methodically chisel fat from their pieces of
art. I thought about how easy they made it
look and also how much I used to wish that
that was what I could do to myself at age 15.
After a thorough run down of the meat and
cuts, I, naturally curious, began to wonder
what they do with the unusual parts of the
animals, like the ears and eyes. The butchers
had stressed they try to make as little waste
as possible. It was a question I later regretted.
The butcher explained that she boils the
pig heads whole causing the parts to decom-
pose and form a congealed substance. Then,
she molds it into a bundt cake shape and
sells this as a delicacy called "head cheese."
I asked to see it.
She offered me a slice of her creation after
sensing my curiosity. I hesitated; certain I
could see pieces of an eye and Crisco-like fat,
and then placed the moist brown slice on my
tongue. In an attempt to not taste it, I pushed
it to the roof of my mouth, closed my eyes and
swallowed the whole thing at once. It tasted

so strongly of salt that it made my mouth dry.
However, I wasn't surprised that I had.eaten
the slice because of what it was made out of
- it's rude to turn down something someone
else makes - I was surprised simply by the
fact that I ate it. Three years ago I didn't eat
food. This trip to a butcher was not about the
job. It was a test.
In my first year of high school, I would do

those who have it and to those who don't. I
hated food. I hated it because I lost control of
it. I hated it because it caused so many prob-
lems. I hated food because I still didn't feel
beautiful even after I stopped eating it.
As the butcher told me his qualifications
for the meat he purchases and sells, he said
he could tell when an animal was poorly fed
because their muscles weren't well devel-

i

She continued to explain that because ofmy
weight I was at a point where I needed to be
careful of my heart. It was being overworked
and fast movements could have serious ,et
sequences. She also told me if I persisted to
deny myself food, I would not be able to have
my own kids. A crack traveled down my ver-
tebrae and in reverse motion the hairs on my
arms and back of my neck stood up. I cared
less about the potential of my heart
stopping when I walked up stairs - I
wanted to be a mom someday.
I knew at this point, my moth-
er would not rest until treatment
worked and the threat of death was
retired. She wouldn't let the disease
win. I should thank her more often,.
Not eating became easy - I had
become immune to hunger. Then
when I started treatment and eating
again, after months of ignoring the
growls, forcing an entire meal into my
stomach was harder. I could visual-
ize the organ, shriveled and prunish
from lack of use, having to stretch out
for the entire serving of roast beef I
had consumed. It hurt. I would make
dimples in the skin on my belly after
I ate, measuring how farI could push
in with my fingers and feeling inter
gible pain as I could push less and less
- I was full.
Today, I clamor in my kitchen
working to make food pretty, making
sure spinach leaves are blanched just
OLLAND enough so that they're soft but still as
vibrant as the greens still attached to
the earth. There's seldom a day I don't book-
mark a recipe and explore the never-ending
food blogosphere. The difference between
now and then is that, although the voice is
still here, it's much more quiet now and I
know how to not listen.
That day at the butcher I thought about
how much I actually enjoy steak and won-
dered why I ever stopped eating it. Had I
continued believing less food is more, I could
have been dead like the cows whose parts
were all over the butcher's space - certainly
less gruesome, but just as dead.
I expected to go to the butcher and have
some sort of revelation. I expected to figure
out how my relationship with food changed.
I expected to find confirmation that the voice
was really gone. I expected to feel better. But
when I stepped outside of the shop and real-
ized the air carried the thick smell of a recix
rainfall and no longer the smell of cold cut
meat, that was the only change I felt.
I didn't feel uncomfortable and I didn't feel
guilt for what I did in my past. I didn't really
feel anything - it wyas all just meat to me. But
perhaps that was affirmation I was look
for.

Deep in the openchambered springs
D of Yellowstone National Park, life
colorfully covers itself across the
safety of secluded landscapes - an image
I'm sure must haunt watercolorists who
were never able to capture it in all of its
magnificence. Behind billowing blankets of
steam lifting skyward every morning, life
truly lives on the edge of survival here. Or
does it? Whether from a distance or nearby,
it's impossible not to see the conglomeration
of hundreds of billions of seemingly ostenta-
tious microorganisms, known as "extremo-
pfiiles," that line the hot spring's runoff
channels, filling them with extravagant col-
ors in an environment that was once thought
to be too extreme for life to grow, develop
or reproduce. Ecologists now recognize that
we are only just beginning to understand
how these organisms have adapted to live
in such harsh environments. I can't help but
to wonder whether the secret to the birth of
life is encoded somewhere within these dis-
tantly related extremophiles.
This past summer, while attending the
University of Michigan's western-most
campus in the Rocky Mountain range of

Jackson Hole, Wyo., 24 students and I
learned a great deal about how the geology
of a region shapes and modifies the ecology
present. About halfway through the sum-
mer semester, our class traveled to Yellow-
stone National Park for three days of field
observations. One morning we traveled to
the Midway Geyer Basin. It was here that I
found myself rapt in the spring's warm veils
of vapor as they erupted into the sky, as if the
clouds themselves were generated on Earth
in these open havens - a sight more marvel-
ous than, dare I write, old Faithful.
"To be honest," Earth and Environmental
Sciences Prof. Joel Blum stated with a sly
smile, "There is no better place to studygeol-
ogy and ecology than right below your feet."
We had been walking on an elevated bridge
as to not damage the fragile, yet smolder-
ing, rock surface below, when I had noticed
onehot spring in particular: the Grand Pris-
matic Spring. While the size alone is impres-
sive (it is the largest hot spring in the United
States), what sets this juggernaut of a spring
apart from others is the array of life that
clings .to the spring's fringe and surround-
ing, outflowing paths, as if the assortment
of microorganisms were the white light cast
by the refraction through an optical prism.
Red, orange, yellow and green were the

resulting shades of the residing extremo-
philes while at the center of the spring itself
laid the sharpest and most contrasting blue
I had ever seen.
Prof. Blum was right. I was only able to
observe how captivating the landscape adja-
cent to the Grand Prismatic was when the
sun rose, further increasing both the heat
of the ground and the heat of the atmo-
sphere. The haste of the climbing clouds
eventually subsided, which in turn illumi-
nated the ebb and flow of groundwater at
the spring's edge. Beating pulsations from
under ,the gaping hole of the Earth flung
water out and into the spectrum of life, and
there was no immediate or apparent trend
for the panorama presented in front of me.
Magnificent reds swirled around orange and
yellow blooms while dingy-brown and neon
greens emptied into the river's channels. I
knew that what I was observing was a living
mosaic of organisms suited to its particular
environment; I just could not find the trend.
But there was a pattern. Minute differ-
ences in elevation at the foothold of the
Grand Prismatic spring regulated which
species of bacteria could outcompete and
thrive best within equally minute differ-
ences in temperature. Where some extremo-
philes pooled in cool-temperature water,

areas tended to be lush in emerald. In other
areas where molten magma was just meters
away from the Earth's surface, hotter rock
temperatures limited which bacteria could
sustain populations. Where these extremo-
philes pooled in high-temperature water,
areas tended to be set ablaze with fiery red.
The happy medium extremophiles, repre-
sented by a stained deck of orange and yel-
low, found refuge underneath waters that
filtered over the thick crust in areas 'not
too hot' but 'not too cold.' The pattern was
a highway-like construction of life that lay-
ered itself almost too perfectly between the
surface of the ground and the surface of the
water. It was another Earth.
I wrote in the beginning that I imagine
there must be a haunted watercolorist some-
where out in the world that was never able to
capture the Grand Prismatic's decadence. I
say this with confidence because to paint the
landscape would be to gloss over the eccen-
tricities of the magnificent showcase of life.
If I were a painter, I would find frustration
in even the smallest paintbrush I owned, for
the bristles alone would be larger than an
entire colony of red extremophiles fighting
the battle to keep their home.

anything to eradicate calories from every

constantly adding up calories and determin-
ing how much I needed to cut to insure I con-
sumed 3,500 less than my basal metabolic
rate would burn that week. That amount of
calories not eaten equaled one pound lost.
There was a time when I knew how many
calories were in an average sized single baby
carrot (it's 1.4 in case you're wondering). I
made sure there were only had five in my
lunch and would throw away any extra car-

My mom and I fought because she just
wanted it to stop. She wanted me to turn
it off and start eating normally again. But
anorexia doesn't work like that. It isn't acti-
vated or deactivated - at least not quickly.
No, anorexia controls the brain like a cruel
puppeteer. I couldn't stop because it told my
brain I didn't want to stop. mom and I
fought because she thought it was easy, but I
knew it was hard and I wasn't sure I had the

"It's like a malnutritioned person," he said.
"The tenderloin along the back is too small."
I knew that three years ago my muscles
wouldn't have fit his standards.
A year after my formal diagnosis, which
my parents first met with denial and then
concern, I sat in my pediatrician's office shiv-
ering because I had no body fat to keep me
insulated. My pediatrician walked in as I ner-
vously bounced my knees up and down. She
gently put her moisturized hands on them to
keep them still, knocking the bones together.
I knew I would be weighed at this appoint-
ment so I wore the heaviest clothes I could
find; this included wearing long underwear
beneath my jeans. The scale tipped at 89
pounds. I continued this method of wearing
heavy clothes for quite a while, hidingbehind
my layers and the heavier numbers to avoid
my mom's eyes laden with bags of exhaustion
and sadness. My mother's visible pain didn't
affect me. Ultimately, I didn't believe any of
the comments she would say about my weight
or my health - she wasn't a doctor, how did
she know?
"Paigey," my doctor started, trying to slice
the silent rope of tension between my mom
and I. "You have to stop this."
