Daily StaffReporter
Gov. Jennifer Granholm
announced the 2010 state budget
yesterday, confirming fears that
large-scale cuts are in store for
an array of programs, including
a 3-percent reduction in funding
for universities.
The 3-percent cut in university
funding would affect state col-
leges and schools, but would not
impact community colleges.
In a statement yesterday, Pro-
vost Teresa Sullivan wrote that
the cut in funding would trans-
late into a $9.8 million decline
in funding for the University of
Michigan's General Fund, from
which a variety of academic pro-
grams receive funding.
Though the University has
asked the state to increase fund-
ing nearly every year, the cash-
strapped state government has
rarely said yes. According to
the University's 2008 Financial
Report, state fundinghas declined
in each year from 2004 to 2008,
except in 2007. The worst of these
years was when the University
was hit with about a 10-percent
reduction in 2004.

Sullivan said in the statement
that such financial problems were
not unexpected and may force
administrators to hold off on
some of the University's plans.
"We anticipate the next several
years will present numerous fis-
cal challenges, and we may have
to delay or rethink some of our
programs and projects," Sullivan
wrote.
However, in interviews yester-
day, Granholm said she was opti-
mistic that the recently passed
federal economic recovery pack-
age would provide the state with
enough funding to maintain the
previous years' funding levels to
public schools and universities.
The 2010 budget includes $500
million in federal funding, but the
state could receive as much as $2
billion in the form of grants and
loans over the next two years.
In a statement released yes-
terday, Cynthia Wilbanks, the
University's vice president for
Government Relations, wrote
that the University of Michigan
plans to work with state officials
to find a solution to its funding
woes.
"We look forward to working
with the governor and legisla-
tors over the next several months
to minimize the negative conse-
quences of what we anticipate
will be another difficult year,"
Wilbanks wrote.

There are about 45 million
Americans without health insur-

Claim made that
non-partisan policy
may violate bylaws
By DANIEL STRAUSS
Daily StaffReporter
Last Tuesday, LSA Student Gov-
ernment President Leslie Zaikis,
speaking on behalf of LSA-SG's
executive board, announced that it
had asked the newly formed Michi-
gan Vision Party and the Michigan

Action Party to refrain from run-
ning party candidates in LSA-SG's
upcoming March elections.
But that announcement has come
under some criticism as it may vio-
late LSA-SG's own bylaws.
On Wednesday, former LSA-SG
President Keith Reisinger submit-
ted a letter to the Daily's opinion
section pointing out the possible
contradiction. The full letter is pub-
lished on today's opinion page.
"First, it is a violation of the LSA-
SG Bylaws to not allow students to
come together and form parties

to run in elections and have their
party name appear on the election
ballot," Reisinger wrote in the let-
ter.
Reisinger is referring to Chapter
20, Section 16 of the government's
bylaws. That bylaw states, "Candi-
dates may jointly request in writ-
ing using the Party Name Request

tor that a party name be printed

Calvin College
ousts student over
Facebook posting
Calvin College has expelled a
student over a sexual comment
about a fellow student he says was
posted on his Facebook page with-
out his knowledge.
Calvin earlier put 19-year-old
sophomore Tony Harris of South-
field on six months' probation.
TheChristianReformedChurch-
affiliated school told Harris to have
no contact with the female student,
move out of the dormitory they
shared and post a retraction on
Facebook.
Vicky Harris tells The Grand
Rapids Press Calvin expelled her
son yesterday after he refused to
post an apology. Messages seek-
ing comment were left for Calvin

Harris says the November post-

U.S. and Russian officials traded
shots yesterday over who was to

in nearby orbits.
The smashup 500 miles (800
kilometers) over Siberia on Tuesday

A prominent Russian space
expert suggested NASA fell down
onthe job by not warning of the col-
lision. But U.S. space experts said
the Russian has the wrong agency.

Respected newspaper The Age

The Age reported that the

21 people.
More than 180 people were

War crimes court overshadows Darfur talks

Up to 300,000
people have died in
the conflict
DOHA, Qatar (AP) - Darfur reb-
els and Sudan government officials
exchanged blame for undermining
three-day-old peace talks, which'
were overshadowed yesterday by
fighting over a Darfur town and the
prospect of an imminent interna-
tionalarrestwarrantagainstSudan's
president for alleged war crimes.
The talks hosted by Qatar are
the first such one-on-one meeting
between the Sudanese government
and Darfur's strongest group of
ethnic African rebels, the Justice
and Equality Movement. It 'was
also the first round of peace talks
between any rebels and the gov-
ernment since the last negotiations
foundered in 2007.
Other Darfur rebel groups are
not attending the talks, which
began Tuesday with the aim of
sealing a cease-fire and setting a
framework for negotiations on a
peace deal. Up to 300,000 people
have died and 2.7 million have been

forced from their homes in Dar-
fur's war, which began after rebel
groups complaining of discrimi-
nation and neglect took up arms
against the Arab-led government
in 2003.
But the talks were shaken yes-
terday by reports that the Hague-
based International Criminal
Court will soon issue a warrant
against President Omar al-Bashir,
whom court prosecutors accuse of
war crimes for allegedly master-
Aminding genocide against Darfur's
ethnic Africans. Al-Bashir denies
the charges
A U.S.officialin Washington said
Thursday that the ICC is expected
to issue a warrant this month. The
official spoke on condition of ano-
nymity because of the diplomatic
sensitivity of the situation.
The leader of JEM, Khalil Ibra-
him, who was attending the Qatar
talks this week, welcomed the
report and said his group is ready
to arrest al-Bashir if he doesn't
hand himself in.
"A decision (by the ICC to issue
a warrant) won't affect the Doha
negotiation track, instead it rein-
forces the need for negotiations,"

nominee withdraws

Judd Gregg is the
third Obama
cabinet nominee
to withdraw
WASHINGTON (AP) - Say-
ing "I made a mistake," Repub-
lican Sen. Judd Gregg of New
Hampshire abruptly withdrew as
commerce secretary nominee on
yesterday and left the fledgling
White House suddenly coping
with Barack Obama's third Cabi-
net withdrawal.
Gregg cited "irresolvable con-
flicts" with Obama's policies,
specifically mentioning the $790
billion economic stimulus bill
and 2010 census in a statement
released without warning by his
Senate office.
Later, at a news conference
in the Capitol, he sounded more
contrite.
"The president asked me to do
it," he said of the job offer. "I said,
yes. That was my mistake."
Obama offered a somewhat
different account from Gregg.
"It comes as something of a
surprise, because the truth, you
know, Mr. Gregg approached us
with interest and seemed enthu-
siastic," Obama said in an inter-
view with the Springfield (Ill.)
Journal-Register.
Later, he told reporters travel-
ing with him on Air Force One that
he was glad Gregg "searched his
heart" and changed course now
before the Senate confirmed him
to the Cabinet post. He also said
Gregg's withdrawal won't deter
him from working with Republi-
cans and trying to change the par-
tisan ways of Washington.
"Clearly he was just having
second thoughts about leaving
the Senate, a place where he's
thrived," Obama added.

The unexpected withdraw-
al came just three weeks into
Obama's presidency and on the
heels of several other Cabinet
troubles. The new president is
in the midst of expending politi-
cal capital in Washington - and
around the country - for his
economic package and is seeking
to move forward with an ambi-
tious agenda in the midst of an
economic recession while the
country continues to face threats
abroad.
Now Obama also finds himself
needing to fill two vacancies - at
Commerce and at the Health and
Human Services Department.
Former Senate Democratic leader
Tom Daschle withdrew his nomi-
nation for that post amid a tax
controversy. Treasury Secretary
Tim, Geithner was confirmed
despite revelations that he had not
paid some of his taxes on time.
New Mexico Gov. Bill Richard-
son was Obama's first choice as
commerce secretary. He withdrew
in early January following disclo-
sure that a grand jury is investi-
gating allegations of wrongdoing
in the awarding of contracts in
his state. Richardson has not been
implicated personally.
Gregg was one of three Repub-
licans Obama had put in his Cabi-
net to emphasize his campaign
pledge that he would be an agent
of bipartisan change.
White House Chief of Staff
Rahm Emanuel said Gregg told
the White House early this
week that he was having second
thoughts and met with Obama
about them during an Oval Office
meeting on Wednesday. Emanuel
said there were no hard feelings
and "it's better we figured this
out now than later."
"He went into this eyes open
and he realized over time it
wasn't going to be a good fit,"
Emanuel added.

with fraternities in an effort to
reduce risk and avoid social pro-
bation," Nunez said in an e-mail
interview. "This program was a
product of that philosophy."
In fall 2008, the program was
piloted with four training ses-
sions, which included two for the
IFC and Panhellenic Association
executive boards and two for the
pledge classes.
Parritz said it's important for
sober monitors to receive ade-
quate training because the Greek
community relies on them to
maintain a safe environment at
parties.
"My goal for this program is to
have every new member - that is,
the individuals generally respon-
sible for the operation and conduct
of our social events.- complete it
by February of 2010," Parritz said
in an e-mail interview. "Our com-
munity trusts these individuals
with the safety and conduct of
our social events; as such, they
should be trained by profession-
als, and never be placed in a situ-
ation where they are unsure what
to-do."
Desprez said there have been
three training sessions so far this
semester, with each session having
between 10 and 40 people in atten-
dance. There are planstohave eight
to 12 sessions conducted by the end
of the semester, she said.

members of the IFC and Pan-
hel executive boards have gone
through the training. They plan
to have first-year members start
attending the sessions after spring
break. The training program is not
a series program, but rather some-
thing individuals would go to only
once, he said.
In the past, the program was
imposed as a sanction for chapters
that violated social responsibility
policy, said Parritz. But this semes-
ter, the program will no longer be
used as a requirement for those
chapters, but as a recommended
educational tool for all chapters.
Desprez said there will be other
educational programs designed for
chapters that have violated social
responsibility policy.
"Our hope is we can get as many
people trained and not have people
see it as some sort of punishment,"
Desprez said. "We would design
something different. When we
design an educational program
based on a sanction we would have
it tailored to that particular inci-
dent."
Parritz said the program is not
going to be mandated for all Greek
members so that it remains some-

thing that individual chapters can
voluntarily attend.
"To preserve the integrity and
genuine interest in the sober moni-
tor training program, we are leav-
ing the decision to the individual
chapters as to whether or not they
want their new members to par-
ticipate," Parritz said.
LSA freshman Michael Was-
serman, a member of Delta Tau

sion on Tuesday. He said 'he
thinks the program will be suc-
cessful in helping the Greek
community.
"I think it's going to be very
effective," Wasserman said. "It's
helpful to know what to do in bad
situations and how to assess if it's
something serious."
Nunez said the program was
designed specifically to meet the
needs of the University's Greek
community. He added that the pro-
gram was the first of its kind to be
developed at the University or any
other institution.
"It isn't a cookie-cutter pre-
sentation, or a paid speaker who
makes the same presentation
at universities across the coun-
try," Nunez said. "It is a program
developed by Michigan students
and staff, specifically to address
the needs. of the Michigan Greek
community."
Parritz said the program's goal
is ultimately one of long-term
value, in which all members of the
Greek community will be educated
in this area.

Michigan's promise
New promise zones are good for students and the economy
f the CTools video featuring University Provost Teresa Sulli-
van, the barrage of e-mails from the office of Financial Aid and
the exorbitant bills students pay each semester have yet to sink
in, here's a clue: tuition is absurdly expensive. And across the state,
students who can't afford to pay up have no choice but to forgo a col-
lege education. But the new Michigan Promise Zone Act that was
recently signed into law could ease the burden of higher education
costs to these students. For the act to be effective, though, private
donors must invest in the state's future by helping to pay for these
students to go to college.

On Jan. 13, Gov. Jennifer Granholm
signed the Michigan Promise Zone Act,
which will create zones in which scholar-
ships are provided for students in low-in-
come areas. The promise zones are based
upon the highly successful Kalamazoo
Promise program, which fully covers
tuition to graduates of Kalamazoo Public
Schools who go on to attend in-state public
universities. Since the Kalamazoo Prom-
ise began two years ago, the city has seen
higher graduation rates and an increase in
enrollment. Enrollment and retention rates
for Michigan State University and the Uni-
versity of Michigan have also improved.
The success of the Kalamazoo effort
is encouraging and is more than enough
evidence to justify the state's expansion
of the program. Right now, there are 125
communities in Michigan with poverty
levels that qualify them to become promise
zones. Promise zone status will be granted
on a first-come, first-serve basis for com-
munities that prove they have enough pri-
vate funds to provide scholarships for two
years. After that, the state will match the
funding. Both Muskegon and Pontiac are
already working to raise the money.
The winners here, of course, are the stu-
dents who get the chance to go to college.
The communities eligible to become promise
zones are full of students whose only obsta-

cle to a college education is the bill. Promise
zones will make this sad reality a thing of the
past for many Michigan residents. _
And while students will get free college
out of the deal, the state will see its fair
share of benefits, too. The Michigan Prom-
ise Zone Act will boost the enrollment at in-
state public universities, which will affect
college rankings and likely keep more col-
lege graduates working in Michigan. High-
er enrollment and graduation rates will
lead to economic stability. Churning out
more college-educated workers is the only
way to shift the state's economy away from
manufacturing.
But if Michigan residents want to help
the state, they must do their part to help
make the promise zones a reality. Private
investors should be motivated to donate to
these scholarships until the state matches
the funding, since the fates of private busi-
nesses are tied to the fate of Michigan's
economy. When private businesses and
donors invest in programs that help Michi-
gan diversify its economy, they are helping
themselves in the long run. A better-edu-
cated workforce means more successful
businesses.
And though the zones come too late to help
students already enrolled at universities,
this law might even make it so that Sullivan
doesn't have to appear on CTools anymore.

Democrats have been making up for
lost time with a government spending spree
on the taxpayer credit card."

spending in the recent stimulus package, as reported yesterday by The New York Times.

LSA-SG President's actions
violate organization bylaws
TO THE DAILY:
In response to LSA Student Government
President Leslie Zaikis' decision that party
affiliations were no longer going to be part of
LSA Student Government elections (LSA Stu-
dent Government to drop party labelsfrom ballot,
2/11/2009), the actions of LSA-SG's president
and some of the executive officers are in viola-
tion of the LSA-SG's bylaws and of students'
rights, which those bylaws are intended to pro'-
tect. As a former president of LSA-SG, I would
like to set up some facts for those on campus
who are interested in running in the LSA-SG
election, an opportunity that I would encourage
any interested student to explore.
First, it is a violation of the LSA-SG bylaws to
notallowstudentstocometogether and formpar-
ties to run in elections and have their party name
appear on the election ballot. While a single-
party system is by no means an appropriate way
to handle government elections, banning parties
all together is rather rash and inappropriate. Stu-.
dents who do not have a widespread popularity
base simply cannot win without a party system,
regardless of how qualified they may be.
Furthermore, this solution to the one-par-
ty system problem will only make problems
worse in that only the students who are "well-
connected" or "popular" will continue to win
student government elections because they
will not have the additional finances, time,
and energy that comes with being a member
of a political party. Due to its other important
obligations, LSA-SG is not capable of reaching
out to everyone on campus. This is where par-
ties come into play. Parties have the time and
energy to seek out new and interested students
from a variety of backgrounds to bring more
diversity of perspective and thought to LSA's

student government.
I. strongly encourage all members of govern-
ment, and even all LSA students, to become edu-
cated on their rights to run in an election and
exercise them accordingly.

president ofLSA-SG.
Daily's concerns aboutPh.D.
policy change are unjustified
TO THE DAILY:
There are many questions that still need to be
resolved about the current proposal for continu-
ous enrollment thathas been passed by the Rack-
ham Executive Board, but the issue raised in your
editorial (Rackham's mistake, 02/12/2009) is not
one of them.
Class sizes will not increase by requiring con-
tinuous enrollment. The people who are affected
by this measure are overwhelmingly Ph.D. candi-
dates who are not taking classes. As a Rackham
professor, I meet with my Ph.D. students wheth-
er they are enrolled or not, so this will not really
mean any difference in my workload.
The proposal aims to ensure that departments
have a financial incentive to ensure that students
receivethe proper attention from faculty mentors
and that they have an active University affiliation
upon which to draw if they need to. However, the
questions the GEO raises in Thursday's news arti-
cle (Ph.D.s in uproar over new policy, 2/12/2009)
are pertinent, especially in areas where the
demands of cutting-edge research have tended to
mean that itntakes longer to graduate.

As the economic crisis contin-
ues, our nation is struggling
to turn around its money,
fate and fortune.
Proceeding hand- K
in-hand with our
economic restruc-
turing has been the
call to "Buy Ameri-
can" and even to
mandate it as a part
of the economic
stimulus plan.
The call to buy MEG
American makes YOUNG
some people anx-
ious, both the
free-trade crowd
here and our foreign suppliers. This
week's cover of The Economist maga-
zine melodramatically expressed
those fears. Trade protectionism is
personified as a reanimated corpse
with a horror flick title across the top
that reads, "The Return of Economic
Nationalism."
Despite the stir, buying American
holds a lot of power right now. And
not just on the national level: Gover-
nor Jennifer Granholm's latest State
of the State address featured Michi-
*gan labor as an essential part of the
state's plan. According to Granholm,
"instead of spending nearly $2 billion
a year importing coal or natural gas
from other states, we'll be spending
our energy dollars on Michigan wind
turbines, Michigan solar panels,
Michigan energy-efficiency devic-
es, all designed, manufactured and
installed by... Michigan workers."
We need to make a similar effort
to buy American on a local level.
Regardless of our differences when
it comes to international trade policy,
we can agree on what we want our
city's economy to look like.
All ofus benefit from the smallbusi-
nesses that stitch together Ann Arbor's
economy. Because of the little restau-
rants and bookstores that make this

place so unique, the University is able
to attract some of the most progressive
minds in the world. This is a symbiotic,
even chicken-and-egg relationship; it's
tough to say which boomed first. Ann
Arbor and the University wouldn't be
one withoutthe other.
When I read in the Ann Arbor
News that Shaman Drum bookstore
was looking for help from an inves-
tor, it hit me like a call to arms. More
students are buying their textbooks
online to save money - and in these
hard times, that is completely under-
standable. Shaman Drum owner Karl
Pohrt took pre-emptive measures to
prepare for the blow. He applied Sha-
man Drum for nonprofit status in an
attempt to embrace our community
and Shaman Drum's role in it. The
Internal Revenue Service returned
his request with a letter in November
sayiiigthat they're too swamped with
requests to review it for some time. In
the meantime, Shaman Drum needs
our support.
Students cannot become investors
in our local icons, but our actions en
masse are just as influential. We truly
are voting with our dollars when we
spend them. In this vein, I want to write
a campaign ad for our community.
Shaman Drum has books you'll
never find in a chain store because
Pohrt and his staff cater to our com-
munity. To really look at the shelves
is to take the city's pulse. They'll even
have the esoteric book your profes-
sor suggested you read. But one thing
matters most of all. The place has the
soul of a poet and a scholar. Besides,
it brings literary figures in to speak,
many of whom are recently gradu-
ated authors in need of a launching
point to "the real world."
When I heard that Shaman Drum
might be having tough times, the first
thing I did was pick up some books
there. It's an empty gesture, unless
you do it too. Times are hard for
everyone right now and we have to

stick together.
But we're not just talking about
bookstores here. When you go out to
eat, forget the sandwich chains that
have elbowed their way onto State
Street (aren't as affected franchises if
the rent is too high). Go say hi to Sava
or Silvioinstead.
Want to help
the economy?

Buy American.
Forget seeing "My Bloody Valen-
tine" in 3D. Check out the Michigan
or State Theater instead - your date
might even mistake you for "cool." In
all seriousness: when you choose to
buy local, your lifestyle will change
for the better.
You and the shopkeepers begin to
know each other. Those little conver-
sations you have, or even their nod of
recognition, can pick up your day and
theirs.
Sure, we need our food to be cheap
if we're going to eat out at all. I'd just
like to let the .$5 sandwich crowd
know that they can get a pound of
Indian food at the same price. You
just have to know where to look. For
those in a hurry, snag a chicken sha-
warma pita.
Everything local has an unfair repu-
tation for being expensive. I work at
Caf6Ambrosia, and wehave the cheap-
est cup ofcoffeeinAnnArbor.Working
there only convinces me that people
like that local familiarity. Most of our
customers come in every day.
Give a little place a try that you
haven't been before. My next stop? The

Unchecked power

By KAVI PANDEY
For the Daily
February is a notorious dumping ground for
sub-par superhero movies (see
"Ghost Rider" and "Jumper").
Unfortunately, "Push" fol-

tion. The film's visual beauty
and brilliantly executed action At Showcase

by a convoluted storyline with Summit
super-powered characters who
are impossible to track. It's
nothing more than a big-budget, well-directed
episode of "Heroes."
In the universe of "Push," people with super-
human abilities live among ordinary citizens.
The crackpot origin of their powers is given in
the opening credits, but by the end of the movie
Striking visuals with
no substance.
few viewers will remember or care. People with
superpowers are tracked by Division, a shady
government agency. To accomplish their mys-
terious evil agenda, Division is developing a
serum that will enhance peoples' superpowers.
The story follows a woman named Kira (Camilla
Belle, "10,000 BC"), who escapes from Division
with the only sample of this serum and flees to
Hong Kong. There, she finds help among a group
of superhumans, including Nick (Chris Evans,
"Fantastic Four") and Cassie, played by ageless
wonder Dakota Fanning ("War of the Worlds").
What follows is a spectacularly confusing tale
comprised of a few dazzling set pieces mixed
with long-winded exposition.,
"Push" divides individuals into categories by
their abilities. The film's title comes frpm the
most powerful group, known as Pushers, who
have the ability to "push" any thought into some-
one's mind. Nick is a Mover who can telekineti-

cally move objects; Cassie is a Watcher who has
visions of future events. The rest of this article
could be spent listing the remaining categories:;
characters with new powers seem to appear
whenever it's convenientfor the plot.
The film's main characters are all action movie
stereotypes, but a handful of quirks make their
depictions seem fresh. Nick is the goofy-yet-vul-
nerable protagonist hopingto avenge his father's
death. Cassie is the sassy, all-knowing teenager.
Both have grudges against Division: it killed
Nick's father and has Cassie's mother in custody.
Part of the film's limited appeal is the heroes'
ineptitude. Unlike most superheroes, Nick and
Cassie are far from experts with their abilities.
Nick can't even use his powers to win a dice
game in a back alley and the far-superior Divi-
sion agents beat him up throughout the movie.
Cassie, meanwhile, constantly misinterprets her
visions. For some reason, she believes alcohol
will clarify these visions and ends up buying a
bottle of vodka. Yes, Dakota Fanning gets drunk
in this movie.
Narrative failures aside, "Push" is a feast for
the eyes. It was filmed on location in Hong Kong,
with an impressive lack of green screens. The
city comes alive in the hands of director Paul
McGuigan ("Lucky Number Slevin"), treating
audiences to sequences in the slums as well as
glitzy casinos. The action sequences are easily the
most engagingsections of the film. They are shot
in the claustrophobic, shaky style of "The Bourne
Ultimatum" against the backdrop of Hong Kong's
radiant neon skyline. Unlike most spectacle mov-
ies, "Push" would have benefited from more of
these tight, stunning fight scenes.
But "Push" just can't seem to find its target
audience. There isn't enough violence for action
junkies, comic book geeks will roll their eyes at
the run-of-the mill superpowers and the unnec-
essarilycomplexplotwilldrive awayviewerswho
just want to pass time. McGuigan is a true talent
and will become a Hollywood mainstay as soon
as he has a proper script with which to work. But
"Push" is full of so many double-crossings and
plot holes that few will walk out of the theater
with a clear understanding of what happened.

"The Gspot must be around here somewhere.
Swet 'Coraline

Director Henry
Selick's animation
scores again
By NOAH DEAN STAHL
Daily Arts Writer
Revered animated-film direc-
tor Henry Selick has a new picture
out. It's not a clas-
sic. Selick's new *
film, "Coraline," is
the story of Cora- oralne
line Jones (voiced
by Dakota Fanning, At Showcase
"The Secret Life of and Qualityl6
Bees") a girl who Focus
moves to a gloomy
woodland apart-
ment building with her remarkably
negligent parents (Teri Hatcher of
TV's "Desperate Housewives" and
John Hodgman, the bespectacled
"PC" from Apple' commercials). She
stumbles upon a hidden door that
leads to a parallel universe in which
everything is the same, except more
marvelous and fantastical.
In this world her parents are caring
and devoted; her once-oddball neigh-
bors are still pretty odd, though in an

entertaining, vaudevillian sort of way;
and the chatterbox neighborhood boy
can no longer talk - his cat assumes
the role of conversationalist. Oh, and
everyone has buttons for eyes.
The film is an affirmation of Selick's
ability to create a world so extraordi-
nary and bizarre that it should literally
make viewers' jaws go slack. With a
resume like Selick's, perhaps that's no
surprise. His first feature film, 1993's
"The Nightmare Before Christmas,"
is considered to be one of history's
most iconic holiday films - animated
or otherwise. Three years later, he
adapted Roald Dahl's beloved "James
and the Giant Peach." Five years after
that, however, he forayed into mixed
animation and live-action with "Mon-
keybone," a critically catastrophic
box-office disappointment.
With "Coraline," Selick returns to
the mediun with which he is most
comfortable: stop-motion animation.
He also uses a different technology:
3D animation, which has started tobe
considered by some as the newest cin-
ematic innovation.
3D films are not new by any means.
The industry made a push for it in the
'50s and then again in-the '70s, though
the shtick didn't hold up and 3D tech-
nology took its place in the ranks of

pop-culture ephemera.
In "Coraline," certain 3D aspects
definitely enhance the film. At other
times, however, these elements feel
like cheap parlor tricks. What the film
amounts to is an awkward amalgam
of old and new innovations. This is
particularly the case because of the
admirable - though admittedly primi-
tive - style of the animation. From
an artistic standpoint, it's important
that filmmakers like Selick are mak-
ing stop-motion features. That said,
a film like "Coraline," which employs
the use of both stop-motion and 3D, is
emblematic of the differences between
traditional and modern animation and
revelatory of the limitations of a film
that uses both.
"Coraline" is a light and fun movie
that is, more than anything, an inter-
esting formal endeavor. There's no
question that it pales in comparison to
"The Nightmare Before Christmas"
and "James and the Giant Peach."
Whether it will be remembered and
recalled in the same breath as those
films depends on the success of new
3D technology. "Coraline" could just
as easily be seen as either a significant
step in the direction of film innova-
tion or a well-meaning technological
misstep.

Nicktoons's X factor

By TOMMY COLEMAN
For theDaily
Ever find yourself humming the theme song to
that old '90s X-Men cartoon?
For those craving the group's *
animated return to television,
there's some X-cellent news. Wolverine
Since the first X-Men comic and
in 1963, the gang has become
one of the most popular super- X-Men
hero lineups in American Fridays at
culture. Aside from multiple
comic book series published 8 ppm.
by Marvel, the X-Men have Nicktoons
recently dug their way into the
mainstream with three feature films. Less cele-
brated - at least by a majority of people - are the
X-Men cartoons. "Wolverine and the X-Men" is
the latest animated show, succeeding "X-Men:
The Animated Series" and "X-Men: Evolution."
This retelling of the X-Men story breaks the
norm by beginning not at the time of the group's
formation, but rather at the time they disband.
A mysterious attack on the home of the X-Men
leaves the school and X-Men base in ruins. Pro-
fessor X and team member Jean Grey go miss-
ing, and the remaining X-Men decide to hang up
their tights in exasperation.
In the meantime, the ruthless government-
run Mutant Response Division is capturing and
detaining mutants and anyone who sympathizes
with them. Without the X-Men, there's no super-
team to defend the helpless remaining mutants.
Now it's up to Wolverine to get the
gang back together.
This series's is the most manly
incarnation of the character to
date. He's still the motorcycle-
riding rebellious outsider with
kick-ass sideburns who thinks
everyone's name is "Bub." But his
voice is lower and more intimi-
dating than ever, thanks to Steve
Blum (the voice of Spike from
"Cowboy Bebop"), and each of his
arms is the size of his torso, mak-
ing bodybuilder Ronnie Coleman
look like Steve Urkel.
Wolverine is joined by fellow
teammates and fan favorites Beast,
Wolverine takes
charge at last.
Rogue, Shadowcat, Nightcrawler,
Cyclops, Iceman and Colossus.
Comic fans will be pleased that
most of these well-known Marvel
mutants are very similar to their
comic book counterparts.
Except for Cyclops, that is. Jean
Grey's disappearance has turned
the formerly confident frontman
into a miserable mess, and he has
given up his role as the leader of
the X-Men for a life of moping
around. This allows Wolverine,
once the outsider of the group, to
try his hand at responsibility, tak-
ing Cyclops's place as the captain
of the X-Men.
The animation is stylistically

similar to anime and the visuals of "Wolver-
ine" are noticeably more impressive than those
of "X-Men: Evolution." The environments are
drawn more intricately and the characters'move-
ments animated more naturally. As a result, the
fightingscenes are tremendous. It's impossible to
top the three X-Men
movies when it comes
to mind-blowing
action scenes, but
these cartoon battles
come close.
The cartoons onl
Nicktoons Network
are not exactly tai-
lored to the adult shaping the
demographic, but

Honduras union leaders discuss
Russell plant 'injustices' last night

Stimulus package
headed to House
for vote Friday

University has come
under fire for
licensing deal with
apparel company
By VANESSA NUNEZ
For the Daily
At an event last night, two union
leaders from Honduras spoke to a
group of students about the alleged
injustices they experienced work-
ing at a Russell Athletic apparel
plant.
The event, which was sponsored
by Students Organizing for Labor
and Economic Equality (SOLE),
comes on the heels of news that the
University's Advisory Committee
on Labor Standards and Human
Rights sent a letter to Kristen
Ablauf, director of licensing for the
University.
The letter called to the Universi-
ty's attention allegations of unjust
firing of employees at a Russell
plant in Honduras.
Last month, Russell athletic
apparel fired 1,800 workers from
its clothing factory in Honduras.
Russell claimed the factory closure
was due to economic reasons, but
Honduras union leaders alleged it
was their unionizing that caused
them to lose their jobs.
The plant's union president,
Moises Elias Montoya Alvarado,
and vice president, Norma Estella
Meija Castellanos, presented their
side of the story about the factory
closing and the injustices they
suffered as a result. Both spoke
in Spanish throughout the event,
and had translators convert their
words into English.
Alvarado said that when the
union requested a raise from Rus-
sell management, they responded
by offering them a raise of 3 cents
in U.S. dollars.
"We were shocked," Alvarado
said of the miniscule size of the
raise.
He said that when the union
refused to accept the raise, Russell.
management threatened to take
offers to move the factory to El Sal-
vador and Guatemala.

Senate likelyto vote
later today or
over the weekend
WASHINGTON (AP) - Reluc-
tant to call it quits, key lawmakers
bargained into overtime yesterday
on the $790 billion economic stimu-
lus legislation before reaching final
agreement more than 24 hours
after first announcing a deal.
Lingering controversy over
school-modernization money and
a scaled-back tax break for busi-
nesses forced a delay in final votes
on the legislation.
But by nightfall, with Democrat-
ic leaders eager for final passage
by the weekend, all issues were
reported settled. House leaders
announced a vote for today, with
the Senate to follow later in the day
or over the weekend.
Republicans, lined up to vote
against the bill, piled on the scorn.
"This is not the smart approach,"
said Sen. Mitch McConnell of Ken-
tucky, the Republican leader. "The
taxpayers of today and tomorrow
will be left to clean up the mess."
President Barack Obama deliv-
ered what has become a daily call
for congressional action, this time
from the industrial heartland.With
approval of the bill, he said in Peo-
ria, Ill., companies "may be able to
start growing again. Rather than
cutting jobs, they may be able to

create them again."
He spoke at Caterpillar Inc., the
heavy machinery giant that has
announced 22,000 layoffs. The
president has said in recent days the
company has promised to rescind
some of them once the stimulus
passes, but Chief Executive Jim
Owens said there probably would be
more layoffs before that can occur.
At the Capitol and in an atmo-
sphere of uncertainty, provisions
were coming to light that had not
been included in the original bills
that passed the House or Senate - or
that differed markedly from earlier
versions, or that appeared to brush
up against claims of the bill's sup-
porters that no pet projects known
as "earmarks" were included.
One last-minute addition was a
$3.2 billion tax break for General
Motors Corp. that would allow the
ailing auto giant to use currentlosses
to claim refunds for taxes paid when
times were good. GM got a $13.4 bil-
lion federal bailout late last year -
and is expected to receive more in
2009 --and argued that without the
provision, its government-financed
turnaround plan could force the
company to pay higher taxes.
The legislation does not mention
GM specifically, but the company has
been lobbying hard for the provision
for months, with help from Michi-
gan's representatives in Congress.
"We wanted to make sure that the
restructuring wasn't counteracted,"
said Rep. SanderM. Levin, D-Mich.

Honduran union leader Moises Elias Montoya Alvarado (right center) talks at an event last night in the Michigan League.

Holding a solid black Russell
sweatshirt, Alvarado said the
workers were required to meet
high quotas. But Alvarado said that
even if the workers hit such high
marks, "we only make 1,300 lempi-
ras, which in U.S. dollars would be
about $60 a week."
Alvarado said that when he
arrived in the United States
earlier this month as part of a
speaking tour to raise awareness
about Russell's alleged abuses,
he was stunned to see the price
of the goods they had been mak-
ing.
"When we came to this country
we were shocked to find the prices
students paid for this apparel," he
said, adding that the price of just
one of the shirts in the United
States equals their salary for one
week.
However, Alvarado said that
making more money was not the
point of his fight for justice.
"We are not asking for enormous
salaries," he said, "all our organiza-
tion is fighting for is dignity and a
fair wage in which we can support
our families."

As a result of their participation
in the unionization, Alvarado and
Castellanos began receiving con-
tinuous threats to their lives from
the company. Castellanos said she
was so terrified by the threats that
she told her kids that they couldn't
go to school one day.
The union leaders found they
couldn't even get cooperation
from their own government, since
many of the people who worked
in business there also worked for
the government. They decided
they needed to get international
help by going to the U.S. Congress
to denounce the negligence of the
Honduran government.
Since Russell has contracts with
the University of Michigan as well
as other universities, Alvarado and
Castellanos recognized the enor-
mous impact students on campus
could have in improving workers'
rights.
"Work of students in this is
totally fundamental in a number
of aspects; historically students
have been able to talk about these
abuses being done by corporate
monsters," he said. "Students can

demand that the company must
follow the code of conduct set forth
by the University."
Castellanos added: "We are
not here just to represent workers
from Honduras but workers from
all over the world putting up with
these kinds of abuses."
Students in attendance last night
said they felt it was very important
to understand the injustices in
Honduras.
LSA freshman Claire Baker said
she thought it was great to "have
people actually come here who
have experienced this, and once
you see the faces of the workers,
you can see it is real and you can
connect more with it."
LSA sophomore Britt Wede-
noja said she "thought it was very
beneficial to get the whole picture
from the ground floor, from their
point of view, it was very mov-
ing."
Both also said they hope that
this event will encourage Univer-
sity of Michigan President Mary
Sue Coleman to take the necessary
steps to ensure equal rights and
fair labor laws in Honduras.


FUNDING
From Page 1
Despite the budget cuts and
financial strains facing both the
University and the state, Sullivan
said she remains optimistic about
the University's ability to maintain
its high academic standards and
accessibility to students from all
economic backgrounds.
"In setting budget priorities, pro-
tecting the University's academic
mission - including recruiting
and retaining outstanding faculty
members - is at the forefront of
our decision-making. Making U-M
accessible to students also is one of
our top priorities," she said.
As the state's economic picture
has darkened and funding for high-
er education has dwindled, Sulli-
van wrote that the University has
worked to reduce expenditures.
"Although we have cut operat-
ing expenditures by more than $135
million during the past six years, we
must reduce expenses even more
to meet the financial challenges
ahead," she wrote.

In addition to these cost-cutting
measures, the University plans to
continue reducing expenses wher-
ever possible. However, one of its
major focuses has been increasing
the amount of financial aid avail-
able to students.
According to Sullivan, a com-
mittee comprised of faculty, staff
and students will work to find new
ways for the University to cut costs
in the year ahead. The committee
is scheduled to meet for the first
time in March and will seek input
and suggestions from students, fac-
ulty and staff.
Cuts to public school funding,
the state correctional system and
arts and culture programs were
also included in Granholm's budget
released yesterday. These cuts are
designed to combat the approxi-
mately $1.4 billion budget deficit
Michigan is expected to face in the
2010 fiscal year.
The cuts are expected to include
layoffs of 1,500 state employees,
the release of 4,000 non-violent
prison inmates and a $59 per pupil
reduction in spending at public
schools.

"Quality of health care should

"Unfortunately, many people are

thinks that could be changed

ber of candidates (rounded up) for

No party may run more candidates

Zaikis's original announcement
came after weeks of internal dis-
cussions with the executive board
- made up of the president, vice
president, treasurer, counsel, exter-
nal relations officer, academic rela-
tions officer and secretary - but not
the entirety of the LSA-SG body.
After Tuesday's meeting, Zaikis
said the executive board's inten-
tion was to promote a system in
which issues are the focus of the
election, not parties. The idea was
that candidates who run with a
party are identified more with
being part of that party.than with
the issues they are campaigning

Nathaniel Eli Coats Styer, chair
of the University's chapter of Col-
lege Democrats, said Dingell's talk
is coming at an important time.
With the economy struggling, par-
ticularly in Michigan, Styer said a
national health care program is a
necessity.
Styer said the event would be

In an interview this week, Reis-
inger said that's exactly the oppo-
site of what being in a party does.
"Parties are how we get diversity.
This is how we get diverse constit-
uents on government, by allowing
parties, because parties will go out
and do all the outreach that people
don't have time to do," Reisinger
said. "Government attracts the
same type of people, and so if you're
not purposefully outreaching dif-
ferent groups of people, by elimi-
nating parties, you're eliminating
diversity."
Steven Benson, the counsel for
LSA-SG, said that on Tuesdaynight,
LSA-SG leaders encouraged people
to run on independent tickets, as
opposed to telling them that parties
are outlawed. He said that knowing
this, the executive board is acting
accordingly.
"We're open for parties to run,"
Benson said. "We're allowing it to
happen. The bylaws call for it."

SI's Davis: Michigan
tourney hopes still alive

For the first time since 1998,
the Michigan men's bas-
ketball team will make the
NCAA tournament.
Well, that's according to Sports
Illustrated's Seth Davis. The col-
lege basketball writer features a
weekly column, "Inside College
Basketball," and is a studio analyst
during CBS's
NCAA Tourna-ALEX
ment coverage.
"Right now, PROSPERI
they're on my On Mven's
board," Davis Basketball
said during a
teleconference Feb. 11to promote
his partnership with Coke Zero.
"They're probably going to be one
of my last teams in, certainly. But
right now, I have them in."
Davis was in Indianapolis on
Wednesday to participate in a
mock selection seminar for the
NCAA Tournament. The real
Selection Sunday is March 15. Of
the 65 spots, 31 are automatic bids
awarded to conference tournament
champions, while the other 34 are
at-large bids.
He pinned upset wins against
UCLA and Duke as keys to the
Wolverines' chances of dancing in
March.
"They're going to hang on to
that (UCLA) win and the win over
Duke at home for all it's worth,"
Davis said. "There are not going to
be a lot of teams in that situation
that are goingto have those quality
wins."
The Blue Devils are No. 6 and
the Bruins are No. 11, and the bet-
ter they play, the stronger Michi-
gan's wins will look.
"You give me 34 at-large teams
that are more worthy," Davis said.
"When you get to those last few
spots, you're really looking at some
very flawed resumes."
But how much stock can you put
in two games? Sure, both teams
were ranked No. 4 at the time, but
they both have one glaring weak-
ness - post presence. Defending
the paint has been one of Michi-
gan's biggest problems all season,

Sophomore Manny Harris and the Wolverines areonthe NCAA Tournamentbubble.

SAID ALSALAH/Daily
Sophomore Carl Hagelin will skate in front his father Boris this weekend as Michigan takes on Nebraksa-Omaha.
Sophomore finds comfort in
father's visit from Sweden

and if there were any highly-
ranked teams that could fall to
the Wolverines, it would be those
two. Plus, both games came before
conference play, when most teams
often hit their stride.
Michigan can point to those
two games as reasons to receive a
bid, but the Wolverines need to do
more.
Ultimately, Michigan's poor
road record night be the reason
they're in the National Invitation
Tournament in March. The Wol-
verines are an impressive 12-3 at
home, but just 1-6 on the road with
a 2-1 record at neutral sites. Their
lone road victory came against
lowly Indiana, who is 1-10 in the
Big Ten.
If Michigan (5-7 Big Ten, 15-10
overall) doesn't improve its play on
the road, it will find itselfaoutside
the tournament bubble. There are
two must-win road games left, and
the first is this Sunday when the
Wolverines take on Northwestern
(4-6,13-8) at Welsh-Ryan Arena in
Evanston.
The Wolverines have three more
games after Sunday's to rack up
more road wins - Iowa on Feb. 22
(another must-win), Wisconsin on
Mar. 1 and Minnesota a week later.
But to impress the NCAA Tour-
nament Selection Committee, wins
at Northwestern and Iowa won't
cut it. Michigan must win its regu-
lar-season finale against the Gold-
en Gophers, the final ranked team
the Wolverines face on the road. If

they lose, they'll be left without an
impressive road win.
And the work doesn't end there,
as Michigan must put on a strong
performance at the Big Ten Tour-
nament. The conference tourna-
ment is the last opportunity for
bubble teams to make their case
for the Big Dance. Last season, No.
10 Illinois, whose only shot at the
NCAA Tournament was to win
the conference title, made it to the
championship game before falling
to No. 1 Wisconsin.
Like the Illini, Michigan will
have to make a run during the
weekend. Michigan would be the
No. 8 seed if the tournament start-
ed today, meaning it would have to
win a game on Thursday to play in
the quarterfinals on Friday. Both
games are must-win. An early exit
will diminish whatever success
the Wolverines have over the next
three weeks.
The fact that Davis put Michi-
gan in his mock bracket shows he
is confident that Michigan will
finish strong. But he should be
cautious. There's little reason to
believe the Wolverines will make
a run in these last six games. They
squandered a golden opportunity -
to impress the Selection Commit-
tee when they lost 54-42 to Michi-
gan State on Tuesday, and have
lost seven of their last nine games.
But ifnthey can go as far as Illi-
nois in the Big Ten Tournament,
then Davis's prediction may come
true.

By NICOLE AUERBACH
Daily Sports Editor
At the end of Tuesday's hockey
practice, Michigan sophomore
Carl Hagelin walked off the ice,
saw his father in the bleachers
and called out to him in his native
Swedish.
Standing close to Hagelin as
he conversed with his dad, senior
forward Danny Fardig tried to
mimic his teammate.
After a couple of attempts, Far-
dig gave up with a smile, and the
father and son continued making
plans for the evening.
Boris, Hagelin's dad, has been
in town visiting from Hagelin's
hometown of Sodertalje, Sweden,
since last Thursday. Lastweekend,
he watched the Wolverines sweep
Lake Superior State, and he'll be
in the stands again tonight as they
take on Nebraska-Omaha.
And when Boris is around, it
usually bodes well for Michigan
- or at least his son. Last Satur-
day, Hagelin tallied the game-
tying goal with 28 seconds left
in the first period to swing the
momentum in Michigan's favor.
The Wolverines eventually won
the game, 2-1.
It's hard to quantify, but the
Michigan coaching staff agrees:
Hagelin plays better when his

father is in town. That could be
a good omen for this weekend's
series against the Mavericks (8-9-
7-3 CCHA, 13-11-7 overall).
"Some kids put too much pres-
sure on themselves when their
parents are here to really show
them what they can do," Wolver-
ine assistant coach Mel Pearson
said. "Obviously, in his situation,
it's different. He doesn't feel that
pressure to have to perform. It just
encourages him.... We might have
to get (Boris) to live over here per-
manently if that's the case."
Boris normally flies to Ann
Arbor about four times each year
for ten-day trips, during which he
stays with Hagelin and his room-
mate, sophomore forward Louie
Caporusso.
"It's me, him and Boris, the
three amigos," Caporusso said.
"He made us steak Monday night.
Unbelievable. Filet mignon, and
he made us mashed potatoes and
a nice salad with avocado. ... My
stomach's been well-nourished
since Boris has gotten here, for
sure."
Caporusso said they also like to
go to the movies together, adding
that the three of them recently saw
Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa at the
Dollar Movies at Briarwood Mall.
Hagelinsaidhis father alsokeeps
him and Caporusso in order. The

two rushed to clean up their apart-
ment last Wednesday evening, the
night before Boris flew in.
Despite the added chores,
Hagelin enjoys having his father
around. And even though Boris
attends practice each day when
he's in Ann Arbor and has previ-
ous coaching experience, he said
he hardly discusses hockey with
his son because Hagelin doesn't
like it.
"That's just something me
and my dad stopped doing when
I turned 17," Hagelin said. "He
used to talk alot about hockey. We
just stopped talking about hockey
because I can't think too much
about it. Still, he talks about hock-
ey everyday with my other broth-
ers, so he'll get his hockey talk in
every day."
Caporusso explained that each
player treats hockey differently.
Some like analyzing their play off
of the ice, but others prefer dis-
tancing themselves. Hagelin is one
of the latter.
"Carl doesn't like to think about
hockey too much during the week,"
Caporusso said. "When he's away
from the rink, he likes to stay away
from the rink. When he gets to the
rink, he gets pretty excited."
With his father in the stands,
Hagelin has even more of a reason
to be fired up tonight.

the Maple Leaf flag. What are
your plans for honoring that
country on that day? A themed
party? Traveling north? Watch-
ing CBC?
Didn't think so.
But if celebrating Canadian
heritage is
something
that strikes CHANTEL
your fancy, JENNINGS
perhaps ---e -
you should OnWoa en's
consider B
attending the Michigan women's
basketball game against Min-
nesota.
Senior Stephany Skrba and
junior Krista Phillips, both native
Canadians, will be playing at Cris-
ler Arena this Sunday.
Still not sold on coming?
Well, how about the fact that
this Sunday is probably the last
chance you'll have to watch the
Wolverines play this year? Their
only remaining home game is
during Spring Break.
And trust me, despite its 10-14
record, this is a talented team
that you'll want to see play. Mich-
igan has beaten two top-25 teams
this year and nearly toppled a
third. Each game, it seems like
another player comes out of the

4

woodwork for Michigan.
Will freshman Courtney Boy-
lan drop 18 like she did against
Kentucky? Is freshman Carmen
Reynolds going to follow up her
20-point performance against
Penn State with something equal-
ly thrilling? How many threes
will senior Carly Benson hit?
You might think, why do I care
about the Golden Gophers?
Wolverine point guard Jessica
Minnfield will be taking on her
counterpart in Minnesota's point
guard Emily Fox. Minnfield,
Michigan's starting court gener-
al, will have her hands full with
Fox's quickness. Not only is Fox
a WNBA prospect, but she also
holds the world record in cup
stacking, which is actually a real
sport. Confused? Check out you-
tube.com or just come Sunday.

If you heckle her enough, maybe
she'll show you.
Are you intrigued yet?
Consider the fact that Michi-
gan coach Kevin Borseth is the
most animated coach in the Big
Ten. Each game, he paces up and
down the sideline shouting at the
players, refs and assistant coach-
es - sometimes even turning his
head toward the heavens.
But you've got to hand it to
him. He knows what he's doing.
In the past 18 years, teams he has
coached have been to 17 post-
season tournaments. He knows
what it takes to turn a mediocre
program into a championship
contender. Even John Wooden
didn't turn UCLA into a basket-
ball powerhouse overnight.
Still not convinced?
This Sunday's game is the Wol-
verines' Pink Zone Game. The
Pink Zone Game is part of the
Women's Basketball Coaches
Association's initiative to raise
breast cancer awareness and
support.
The Wolverines are work-
ing towards earning $20,000
for the University of Michigan
Women's Health Program.
At this Sunday's game, "Pink
Zone" T-shirts will be sold for
$10, and everyone at the game
wearing pink willzbe entered in
a raffle to win prizes. The play-
ers will even wear pink uni-
forms, which will be auctioned
off during the game.
What else are you doing on
Sunday?
Between the Canadians,
Borseth, the show of talent and
the charitable cause of this
game, you have no reason not to
be there. So, on Sunday, trade in
yourhomework for aticket, your
mnaize and blue for pink, and
even if you're not Canadian, con-
sider celebrating at Crisler. Eh?
