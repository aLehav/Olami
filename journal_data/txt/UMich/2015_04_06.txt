Spring Game 

Initiative aims to 
increase minority 
enrollment amid 
calls for change

By ALLANA AKHTAR 

and CARLY NOAH

Daily Staff Reporters

The University will host 46 high 

school freshmen and sophomores 
from Kalamazoo Public Schools 
for a three-day residential pro-
gram designed to spur increased 
application and enrollment num-
bers for underrepresented minori-
ties on campus.

The purpose of the program 

is to expose younger high school 
students to the University in a way 
that will encourage them to aspire 
to attend. Students must have at 
least a 3.0 grade point average and 
submit a 300-word essay to gain 
acceptance into the program.

The newly formed Michigan 

Institute for the Improvement of 
African American Representation 
— a committee connected with the 
University’s Black Student Union 
— will organize and run the pro-

gram.

Engineering junior Will Roys-

ter, who helped launch MIIAAR 
and is the BSU Academic Concerns 
Committee chair, said the idea 
stemmed from interest in expand-
ing minority representation on 
campus. He said many of the pro-
grams offered for minorities at the 
University don’t provide partici-
pants with the full college experi-
ence.

“Most of the other programs 

don’t let students allow themselves 
to visualize themselves as students 
on campus,” Royster said.

Among the activities planned 

are opportunities for participants 
to meet with various student orga-
nizations, take a campus tour, view 
a presentation from an admissions 
counselor, participate in an SAT 
workshop and hear from Univer-
sity alum Shawn Blanchard, who 
teaches mathematics for the Uni-
versity’s Summer Bridge Program, 
a pre-freshman year academic 
preparation program.

While this is the immersion 

program’s pilot year, Royster said 
he hopes to increase participation 
from other underrepresented high 
schools in the state, such as dis-

‘Hash Bash’ promotes 

ballot measure 

legalizing cannabis 

and hemp use

By ISOBEL FUTTER

Daily Staff Reporters

Marijuana smoke, along with 

screams of, “Free the weed, end 
the war,” filled the air Saturday 
as the 44th annual Hash Bash 
unfolded on the Diag and Mon-
roe Street. The event lit up at 
“high noon.”

Speakers included State Rep. 

Jeff Irwin (D–Ann Arbor), Lan-
sing Mayor Virg Bernero, City 
Councilmember 
Sabra 
Briere 

(D—Ward 
1) 
and 
acclaimed 

comedian and activist Tommy 
Chong.

Since its inception, Hash Bash 

has been an outlet for advocates 
of marijuana decriminalization. 
This held true Saturday. Charlie 
Strachbein, who coordinates the 
accompanying Monroe Street 
Fair, estimated that 9,000 people 
were in attendance. One of these 
attendees was the event’s origi-
nator: John Sinclair.

The first Hash Bash was held 

in 1972 as a response to the 1969 

arrest of activist and poet John 
Sinclair, who gave two marijua-
na joints to an undercover offi-
cer. Sinclair was sentenced to 10 
years in prison, which sparked 
the “John Sinclair Freedom 
Rally” in December 1971.

Held 
in 
the 
University’s 

Crisler Arena, the event featured 
a host of celebrities, including 
John Lennon, Yoko Ono, Stevie 
Wonder and Allen Ginsberg who 
came to protest for Sinclair’s 
release. The Michigan Supreme 
Court eventually overturned the 
law under which Sinclair had 
been convicted, and by the fol-
lowing April, the first Hash Bash 
was underway.

“I started this and I’m still 

alive, so I like to come back,” Sin-
clair said. “This was all a little 
idea me and some other people 
had 44 years ago … One day, I’ll 
be here and we’ll be celebrating 
legalization in Michigan.”

A large emphasis at this year’s 

Hash Bash was promoting a 2016 
state ballot measure that would 
legalize cannabis and hemp 
use in Michigan. It also aims to 
remove past criminal convic-
tions for the possession of mari-
juana.

In Ann Arbor, marijuana pos-

session is a civil infraction — 
offenders can incur a $25 fine.

Diag festivities 
feature student 

organizations, tap 

water tasting

Daily Staff Reporters

Though Earth Day is celebrated 

nationally on April 22, University 
celebrations came weeks early this 
year to accommodate potential 
conflict with final exams.

Central Student Government’s 

Commission on University Sus-
tainability, the Student Sustain-
ability Initiative and University 
Dining co-hosted the festivities, 
in partnership with more than 20 
campus groups Friday. The event 
drew in both University students 
and local attendees, with activities 
underway on both the Diag and in 
Palmer Commons.

On the Diag, activities included 

sustainability-themed 
games, 

moss graffiti and a “take-the-tap-
water taste test,” in which students 
were asked to taste test unlabeled 
containers of bottled and tap water 
and guess which was which.

Students selected Knute Nadel-

hoffer, professor of ecology and 
evolutionary biology and direc-
tor of the University’s Biological 
Station, to address attendees and 
explain the significance of Earth 
Day. He spoke from the steps of 
Hatcher Graduate Library to the 
crowd.

Nadelhoffer spoke to the inten-

tions of Gaylord Nelson, the former 
Wisconsin senator who founded 
the day in 1970, whose wish was to 
raise awareness about a multitude 
of environmental issues, including 
pollution and the impact of over-
population on the environment.

“Back then, we had no idea 

about fossil fuels and burning for-
ests,” Nadelhoffer said.

Several of the University’s 

South Asian student perfor-
mance groups gathered at the 

Power Center on Saturday night 
to perform in the fifth annual 
“That Brown Show.”

Michigan Sahana, a student 

group composed of Indian clas-
sical dancers and musicians, 
organizes and hosts TBS every 
year.

Engineering 
sophomore 

Sandeep Siva, Michigan Sahana 
vice president and TBS Com-
mittee chair, said the event 
was created to showcase South 
Asian arts to University students 

and local residents. Siva said 
the founders of the event titled 
the event “That Brown Show” 
to connect across a variety of 
groups across campus.

More than 800 students, 

alumni from the performing 
groups, family members of par-
ticipants and Ann Arbor resi-
dents attended Saturday’s event.

In the time it takes a watch’s

its watches — will open on South 
Main and East Liberty streets.

The new store in Ann Arbor 

will be the first of eight to 10 addi-

However, smoking marijuana on 
a state university campus is a 
misdemeanor, punishable by a 
fine up to $2,000 and up to one 
year in prison.

The Ann Arbor Police Depart-

ment 
and 
University 
Police 

patrolled the event and watched 
for any emergencies. Despite the 
fact that the usage of marijuana 
was illegal, and very prominent 
at Hash Bash, only three arrests 
were made.

To Sinclair, addressing mari-

juana use as a criminal offense is 
a laughing matter.

“Crime?” Sinclair said. “What 

kind of crime do they have here? 
I don’t worry about it, I’m going 
to get high anyways.”

The Michigan Comprehen-

sive Cannabis Law Reform Ini-
tiative Committee — which goes 
by MI Legalize — helped to both 
organize the event and book 
local speakers. The organization 
is an advocate of the pending 
legalization ballot measure.

“We have been working hard 

to provide you with a uniquely 
thought-provoking and entirely 

radical rally,” said Nicholas 
Zettell, Hash Bash Director of 
Operations. 
“We’ve 
selected 

accomplished and knowledge-
able figures within this diverse 
and colorful community to pro-
vide you with a savory blend of 
community leaders, elected offi-
cials, patients and much more.”

Irwin, one of the elected offi-

cials, is the state representa-
tive responsible for drafting the 
pending 2016 ballot measure. He 
believes it is unethical to contin-
ue criminalizing individuals for 
smoking marijuana.

“You’ve heard a little bit about 

how cannabis is a gateway drug, 
and I’m here to tell you folks it is 
a gateway drug to a real bad time 
with law enforcement,” Irwin 
said in a speech to Hash Bash 
attendees. “It’s a gateway to a 
criminal record; it’s a gateway to 
a misdemeanor or a felony; it’s a 
gateway to losing your financial 
aid. It’s a gateway to hundreds 
of millions of dollars wasted of 
taxpayer money arresting, try-
ing, prosecuting and incarcerat-
ing marijuana users.”

In a phone interview prior to 

the event, Briere said it is impor-
tant to remember that Hash 
Bash promotes activism and 

political commentary, not civil 
disobedience.

“It’s a collection of speeches 

and live music where people 
from different areas collaborate 
to focus on reforming the mari-
juana laws of Michigan,” Briere 
said.

Though Irwin, Bernero and 

Briere all spoke about the legal-
ization of marijuana at Satur-
day’s event, there were many 
different ideas raised through-
out the afternoon’s speeches.

Chong called for the elimina-

tion of the Drug Enforcement 
Administration, claiming that 
marijuana advocates were win-
ning the war on drugs.

“It started as a protest, but 

it’s turning into a celebration 
because we are winning,” he 
said. “What we’re having today 
is the celebration of the greatest 
plant known to man. All pot use 
is medical.”

One speaker, Jim Powers, MI 

Legalize board member, talked 
about how cannabis oil saved 
his son’s life. Powers is also a co-
founder of the Michigan Parents 
for Compassion — an organiza-
tion dedicated to teaching oth-
ers about the positive effects of 
medical marijuana on children’s 
health.

His son, Ryan, suffers from 

Minimal Change Disease — an 
autoimmune disease of the kid-
neys. Powers said despite this, 
he and his son have not received 
medical protection from the 
state, which means his son’s 
successful medical treatment is 
still, technically, illegal.

“Before cannabis oil, Ryan 

was able to maintain a remission 
of about 14 days. I’m pleased to 
report that today, on cannabis 
oil, Ryan has been in remission 
for 302 days,” Powers said.

Law student Reid Murdoch 

and LSA senior Brian Kardell, 
executive members of the Uni-
versity’s Students for Sensible 
Drug Policy chapter, discussed 
the 
impact 
the 
University’s 

policy prohibiting smoking in 
residence halls could have on 
students. Kardell urged the stu-
dent crowd at Hash Bash to take 
a stance against such discrimi-
nation.

“Just because I choose to use 

marijuana doesn’t mean that

DANCE FOR MOTHE R E ARTH

During an Ann Arbor City 

Council meeting, three rep-
resentatives of the Washt-
enaw Interfaith Coalition for 
Immigrant Rights requested 
that the council forbid the 
Ann Arbor Police Depart-
ment from participating in 
federal immigration raids.

The WICIR representa-

tives asked for a revision of 
a 2003 resolution that allows 
the AAPD to take part in 
U.S. Immigrations and Cus-
toms Enforcement raids.

“It is not necessary for 

local police to be involved in 
enforcing immigration laws 
because ICE has the power 
and the resources to enforce 
its orders and its words,” said 

WICIR representative Alicia 
Alvarez. “By enforcing local 
immigration law, the police 
risk losing community sup-
port, and create problems 
with racial profiling.”

John Hieftje, Ann Arbor 

mayor at the time, and Coun-
cilmember 
Mike 
Anglin 

(D–Ward 5) agreed that 
reviewing the resolution was 
necessary to address com-
munity concerns of unnec-
essary violence being used 
during the raids.

Anglin also called for a 

“stronger resolution” that 
would limit the role of the 
AAPD in federal arrests.

Ann 
Arbor 
residents 

became concerned about the 

role of police in immigration 
raids after the AAPD assist-
ed federal agents in the sei-
zure of an illegal immigrant 
who resisted arrest, Hieftje 
said. This made residents 
suspicious of the police.

WICIR 
member 
Laura 

Sanders said these raids 
made the Latino community 
fearful of the ICE.

“ICE officials have thrown 

people on the ground, left 
blood on the floor, chased 
women into rooms,” she 
said.

Three arrested during 
‘Hash Bash’ celebrations

University, Ann 

Arbor police 

enforce prohibition

By ANDREW ALMANI

Daily Staff Reporter

When hundreds of marijuana 

fans crowded the Diag for the 
annual Hash Bash on Saturday, 
local law authorities made three 
arrests for possession of marijuana 
with intent to deliver during the 
course of the event.

In an interview with The 

Michigan Daily several days 
prior to Hash Bash, Division 
of Public Safety and Security 
spokeswoman 
Diane 
Brown 

described the division’s objec-
tives during the marijuana-
fueled festival.

“The event, itself, which usu-

ally has to do with having some 
speeches and collecting signatures 
— that part of it is an acceptable 
event for a student group to hold 
on the Diag like they do most every 
day of the year,” Brown said. “We 
don’t condone what this event 
sometimes attracts with the use 
of drugs or public consumption of 

alcohol.”

Brown said University officers 

often encounter individuals who 
are under the impression that the 
event provides a day of amnesty for 
illegal drug activity.

“There are some people who 

come to this who perceive ... that 
marijuana and other drugs being 
displayed, transacted, possessed or 
used is permissible,” Brown said. 
“So the officers are there to ensure 
that anyone coming to the event is 
able to be there in a safe and secure 
environment.”

Brown said the number of 

arrests varies every year, noting 
that the majority of those arrest-
ed tend to be visitors from outside 
the city.

“Last year, the University police 

officers made one arrest during 
Hash Bash detail,” Brown said. 
“The year before, there were 16 
people who were arrested for pos-
session of suspected marijuana, 
and one person arrested for MIP. 
None of those were students. Very 
few students are arrested during 
this event. But they aren’t usually 
engaged in public displays of viola-
tions of law.”

Because they enforce state law, 

University officers must arrest 

those engaged in the consump-
tion or possession of marijuana. 
According to a city ordinance, use 
of marijuana is a civil infraction 
resulting in a fine. The punishment 
an individual receives depends on 
jurisdiction where the infraction 
occurs.

“If you’re on Dominick’s prop-

erty, you’re in the city; if you’re 
across the street on the Law Quad 
then you’re on University prop-
erty,” Brown said. “If you’re on 
Monroe Street in the middle, that’s 
technically a city street under the 
enforcement of the city police, but 
on all streets that are city property 
and adjacent to the University, both 
police agencies have concurrent 
jurisdiction.”

To reserve events in the Diag, 

a group needs to have some affili-
ation with a University student 
group, staff or faculty. In the past, 
the University has attempted 
to restrict the presence of Hash 
Bash on its property.

“Ultimately, the free speech 

aspect of the event was deter-
mined to make it something that 
could occur,” Brown said. “(The 
concern is) the illegal activity 
that the event tends to draw, not 
the free speech part of it...”

I don’t deserve a professional 
career or that I am a bad student 
and a person,” Kardell said. “As 

leaders of the future, we don’t 
want to feed into a system of mis-
information and justice. We need 
to have our voices heard now.”

tricts in Battle Creek and Detroit. 
He said he hopes to increase the 
number of participating students 
from 46 to 100.

“We want to allow them to accli-

mate to the culture and make them 
passionate about the University,” 
Royster said. “We want them to 
envision themselves at the Univer-
sity.”

Black students enrolled at the 

University currently make up 4 
percent of the student body.

After the Proposal 2 ballot ini-

tiative passed in 2006, the state 
of Michigan outlawed the consid-
eration of race, among other fac-
tors, in the admissions process for 
public colleges. Minority enroll-
ment subsequently declined, and 
the University has relied largely 
on recruitment efforts to encour-
age underrepresented minority 
students to apply and then enroll at 
the Unviersity.

Royster 
said, 
by 
working 

through a student group rather 
than the administration, MIIAAR 
has more freedom and it is easier to 
make efforts to increase minority 
enrollment without being limited 
by Proposal 2. However, Royster 
said, because the program is not a 
part of the University, it is some-
times harder to receive the extra 
resources 
University-affiliated 

programs receive.

“Students can target minority 

groups and bring them to campus,” 
Royster said. “For us, as students, 
we can create a program and reach 
out and make a difference.”

E. Royster Harper, vice presi-

dent for student life, said according 
to the admissions office, students 
who visit campus are more likely 
to attend upon admittance. The 
program, she said, is attempting 
to develop a relationship between 
high-achieving minority students 
and the University to increase the 
likelihood they will want to apply 
and attend.

Erica Sanders, interim direc-

tor of Undergraduate Admissions, 
said students on campus want to 
connect with others from simi-
lar backgrounds or from the same 
area. She applauded the program’s 
effort to connect prospective stu-
dents with current students from 
the same area.

“We are encouraged by the level 

of commitment and dedication 
from Will Royster and the Black 
Student Union to make this pro-
gram a success,” Sanders wrote in 
a statement.

In past years, the University has 

struggled with increasing minority 
enrollment.

Last year, members of the 

Black Student Union launched 
the #BBUM movement, which 
demanded the University increase 
Black enrollment to at least 10 per-
cent of the student population.

MIIAAR worked alongside Rob 

Sellers, vice provost for equity, 
inclusion and academic affairs, to 
help develop the residential pro-
gram. Sellers heads the Office of 
the Provost’s Committee on Diver-
sity, Equity and Inclusion, which 
University Provost Martha Pollack 
convened in December 2013, fol-
lowing the #BBUM campaign.

The committee’s report, released 

in September, recommended the 

University heavily invest in new 
and existing programs to build 
partnerships with target districts 
“to increase the pipeline of college-
ready underrepresented minority 
students as well as first-generation 
students.”

Sellers said the MIIAAR pro-

gram aims to help build familiar-
ity and trust between talented 
students and the University.

“We commend the Black Student 

Union for its dedication and com-
mitment to creating a more diverse 
campus,” Sellers said in a state-
ment. “This is a goal we all share.”

Harper said though the pro-

gram would help get students more 
familiar with the University cam-
pus, she cannot predict whether 
minority 
enrollment 
numbers 

would see a direct impact.

“I think it’s just trying to 

increase the notion that students 
will consider Michigan as an option 
by having them on campus, getting 
them familiar with being on cam-
pus, going to some classes, meet-
ing with other students,” Harper 
said. “I think that this helps in that 
recruitment effort, but I’m not sure 
you can draw a direct relationship 
between if you do this then you’ll 
have more students of color on 
campus, I think that’s a stretch.”

Royster said because this is the 

first year of the program, he, too, 
can’t promise an increase in minori-
ty enrollment without any influence 
in the admissions process. Howev-
er, he said, he can still inspire stu-
dents to attend the University.

“When it comes to students in 

a minority environment, under-
standing they can come here and 
that there is a body and a face that 
looks like theirs is very important,” 
Royster said. “We want to get them 
more excited to apply and more 
aware of the obstacles they will 
face to apply.”

member, said many of the partici-
pating organizations meet togeth-
er regularly, and so hosting this 
event was a way to share the work 
that these groups have done.

“I think sustainability is some-

thing that our previous president 
and our current president, Mark 
Schlissel, have kind of seen as a 
really important value for the Uni-
versity to have and I think a lot of 
students feel that way,” Yang said. 
“For CSG to put on an event like 
this really represents how key sus-
tainability is as a value to every-
one.”

Sustainability was the tagline of 

the day, with each group present 
weighing in on the concept.

LSA 
sophomore 
Stephanie 

Galczyk is a member of the LSA 
Student 
Government’s 
Taking 

Responsibility for the Earth and 
Environment subcommittee — 
which promotes more sustainable 
practices within LSA. At the event, 
she said, to her, sustainability is 
“preserving of natural resources 
that are far from abundant.”

The subcommittee distributed 

natural cleaning products and 
“seed bombs,” colorful clumps 
of birdseed with biodegradable 

paper adhesive.

Keith Soster, director of student 

engagement for University Unions, 
said sustainability through the 
scope of Michigan Dining means 
providing students with locally 
produced food processed within 
250 miles of campus. In the spirit 
of representing local produce, Sos-
ter dressed as a carrot.

He added that making use of 

seasonality is another way the 
University reaps maximum ben-
efits regarding food quality as well 
as cost efficiency. Soster spoke to 
the effectiveness of this technique 
in incorporating healthier food 
into the campus diet.

“Right now, asparagus is out of 

season, so it tastes bad and would 
be expensive,” he said. “We save 
money by not getting it.”

Michigan Dining chefs were 

prominently 
featured 
in 
Fri-

day’s event, performing cooking 
demonstrations and distributing 
healthy snacks.

Friday’s festivities also drew 

discussion on the role of students 
in promoting environmental pro-
tection.

Rackham 
student 
Jonathan 

Morris, a member of the Divest 
and Invest campaign, said activ-
ism is a campus’s most powerful 
tool in making constructive, sus-
tainable change. Divest and Invest 
has repeatedly called on the Uni-

versity to divest from coal and fos-
sil fuels.

Most 
recently, 
Divest 
and 

Invest worked with the CSG to 
pass a resolution calling for the 
University’s Board of Regents to 
create a committee to consider the 
University’s investments and the 
potential of divesting from oil and 
coal companies.

“The best thing for students 

to remember is that they have 
a tremendous amount of politi-
cal power,” Morris said. “Just by 
coming out to an event, or signing 
petitions, they can make a change. 
Activism works when it is run on 
clean, student powered energy.”

Engineering 
junior 
Jessica 

Abfalter, president of the Uni-
versity’s chapter of Take Back 
the Tap, a student group that 
promotes 
the 
importance 
of 

municipal water facilities and the 
value of tap water, said the event 
showed her that most people 
want to reduce the use of plastic 
bottles. She said altering public 
opinion is perhaps no longer the 
primary goal at hand.

“It’s been really refreshing to 

see that it’s not really a matter of 
changing public opinion that we 
need to focus on as much as get-
ting the administration to kind 
of follow along in what the stu-
dent body and the citizens of Ann 
Arbor already have expressed 

that they feel about bottle water,” 
Abfalter said.

The Earth Day celebration also 

showcased the efforts of Beat the 
Bottle, a petition launched last 
week by LSA senior Joanna Thel-
en that calls on the University to 
phase out plastic bottle sales.

LSA sophomore Jayson Toweh, 

CSG 
Sustainability 
Commis-

sion treasurer, added that stu-
dent activism for sustainability 
has expanded significantly since 
Earth Day’s conception — a 
positive sign for the future. He 
dressed as “Rufus the Recycler,” 
the blue mascot of the Univer-
sity’s Waste and Recycling Office.

“Informing people about a 

cause and going to the people in 
charge, is the right way,” he said. 
“It shows education and gets rid 
of the crazy tree-hugger image 
and makes it about the science.”

This new wave of “formal 

activists” 
are 
what 
Toweh 

believes is the future of a less rad-
ical and more mature method of 
making change on campuses.

“This 
event 
raises 
aware-

ness of the wonderful things our 
Earth provides and celebrates 
these things, as well as identifies 
the problems our planet faces,” 
he said. “We hope students will 
participate in more sustainable 
actions and take initiative around 
campus.”

of the show without getting dis-
tracted by the planning process, 
which began in January.

“We put a lot of time and effort 

into it,” he said. “A lot of the time 
it’s easy to get caught up in the 
logistical work, but the main thing 
we wanted to emphasize was the 
community of musicians and danc-
ers that represent South Asian arts 
… The main idea is to build that 
community and build that con-
nection and showcase the arts to 
everyone.”

LSA freshmen Shalini Rao and 

Dhara Gosalia, publicity co-chairs 
on the TBS Committee, posted fly-
ers around campus, chalked side-
walks and promoted the show on 
social media.

Throughout March, members of 

Michigan Sahana and other partic-
ipating dance groups — including 
Michigan Manzil and the Michi-
gan Bhangra Team — posted selfies 
on social media with TBS’s mascot, 
a bear named Thyagraja, using the 
hashtags #traja2015 and #tbs to 
promote the event.

Affectionately known as T-Raja, 

the bear mascot helped make TBS 
more popular and visible this year, 
Rao said.

“People who might not normally 

notice what the ‘That Brown Show’ 
table is, they see the bear dancing 
around and that’s how we can get 
our name out there,” Rao said. “The 
mascot really helped us with get-
ting all the other teams integrated 
with TBS. Even though Michigan 
Sahana hosts it, TBS has been put 
on by eight different groups in 
total, so in the past years it has 
been a struggle getting those other 
teams more involved in promoting 
TBS with us, but taking selfies with 
the bear was a great promotional 

tool.”

Rao added that Saturday’s audi-

ence was one of the biggest in TBS’ 
five-year run.

“It was so rewarding to see 

people asking me if they could sit 
in the taped-off area because there 
weren’t other seats left, or having 
people ask if to go into the balcony 
because the main floor was that 
packed,” Rao said. “We got a lot of 
people to come who didn’t come 
last year.”

Ann Arbor residents Pallavi 

Prabhu and Baani Jain said they 
were impressed with TBS. Prabhu, 
who trained in Indian classical 
dance for 13 years, said her favor-
ite part of the show was the final 
performance put on by Michigan 
Sahana dancers.

“I think it was really well-coor-

dinated and I think they choreo-
graphed it themselves,” Prabhu. 
“It takes a lot of effort to pull off 
something where a teacher isn’t 
watching.”

Prabhu will begin attending 

the University next fall, and said 
she hopes to come back and watch 
future performances of TBS.

“Hopefully next year I’ll be par-

ticipating in it,” Prabhu added.

LSA freshman Rahul Ahluwalia 

said he attended the event to sup-
port his friends in Michigan Raas, 
Michigan Manzil and Michigan 
Izzat, but enjoyed the classical and 
modern dance fusion performanc-
es.

“I thought it spread the culture 

well,” Ahluwalia said.

Siva noted that he regularly 

snuck out to the audience from 
backstage throughout the show to 
observe reactions. He said numer-
ous people after the show told him 
how much they liked the event.

“When the other teams told me 

how much they enjoyed the show, it 
really made me feel like a commu-
nity had been built,” he said.

cities likely to see a new Shinola 
store this year.

Ann Arbor will be the first. 

Heath Carr, chief executive 
officer of Shinola’s parent firm 
Bedrock Manufacturing Co., 
said Ann Arbor residents often 
visit the Detroit store, prompt-
ing the opening of a Main Street 
location.

“We’re very excited to be 

coming to Ann Arbor,” Carr said. 
“We believe we have a solid cus-
tomer following there based on 
the people that make the trip 
over to our Detroit store and for 
that reason we’re very excited 
to be there and can’t wait to get 
open.”

Shinola produces a variety 

of products, including watches, 
bikes, leather accessories and 
paper products. The Detroit 
location produces all of their 
watches and bikes while leather 
production 
expands 
beyond 

Detroit to St. Louis, New York 
and Massachusetts. Paper prod-
ucts are made in Ann Arbor.

Though operated by Bed-

rock Manufacturing in Texas 
and owned by Swiss timepiece 
maker Ronda, Shinola is based in 
Detroit. The city is its epicenter 
for sales, manufacturing, mar-
keting, design, product develop-
ment and distribution.

The crux of the Shinola brand 

is that products are manufac-
tured in America, Carr said.

“We believe in the beauty 

of manufacturing and creating 
jobs in the United States and we 
believe that folks in the United 
States — specifically in Detroit 
and the other cities where we 
manufacture —that people can 

design, create and manufacture 
beautiful products in the United 
States and we want to support 
that as best as we can,” Carr said.

Edwards Brothers Malloy is 

an Ann Arbor-based book print-
ing company and plant.

John Edwards, president of 

Edwards Brothers Malloy, said 
while they print a variety of book 
types — such as textbooks — 
they also supply Shinola with all 
of their sketchbooks and lined 
and gridded journals of all sizes.

“We’re used to shipping books 

that we make all over the coun-
try and all over the world, so it’s 
pretty neat that they’re actu-
ally having a store here in Ann 
Arbor,” he said. “I think for our 
employees it’s a pretty neat thing 
that they can go see our product 
placed at a store in town, a prod-
uct we make for them.”

Like the Shinola in Detroit, 

along with its products the store 
will have a Commonwealth Cof-
fee on its first floor. Unique to 
the Ann Arbor location, how-
ever, will be a “finished-out” 
lower level to be used as an event 
space for brand and community 
events.

“It’s really just about con-

necting to the community and 
having a place where not only 
can people have a coffee and 
purchase the products that we 
manufacture here in the United 
States, but also they can come in 
and hang out,” Carr said.

While Carr said the number 

of employees at the Ann Arbor 
store will be contingent on the 
store’s volume of customers 
and products, Shinola’s other 
branches employ an average of 
eight workers.

Beyond functioning as a store, 

Carr said the Ann Arbor Shinola 
may also partner with the Uni-

versity, as is done through its Detroit 
store with the College for Creative 
Studies. Because the store is locat-
ed near the campus, the company 
works with the school to both par-
ticipate in and sponsor classes, Carr 
said. They’ve given courses in envi-
ronmental design, bicycle design, 
watch design and leather accessory 
design.

“We’re actively involved with the 

school, we love being in that build-
ing, being part of the creative energy 
from there,” Carr said.

While no official discussion has 

begun as to whether Ann Arbor’s 
new Shinola store will open up lines 
of communication with the Univer-
sity, Carr said it’s likely to arise even-
tually.

“We love being in the town where 

the University is and introducing 
the brand to the University and the 
community there, so I wouldn’t be 
surprised if we’re working with the 
University in many diverse ways in 
the future,” he said.

Shinola has already collaborated 

with University students. In SHEI 
Magazine’s last issue, which had 
a theme of “movement,” Shinola’s 
watches, bikes and leather goods 
were featured in a 10-page spread.

LSA senior Anna Fuller, editor 

in chief of SHEI Magazine, said the 
issue was her first experience with 
the brand, and was a very positive 
one.

“We had such great success work-

ing with them this past fall and 
everyone really loved the brand,” 
she said.

K

urt Vonnegut wrote in his 
last book, “A Man With-
out a Country” that most 

great 
literature 

— “A Farewell to 
Arms,” 
“Ham-

let,” the Bible — 
is about what a 
bummer it is to 
be a human being. 
He wrote next: 
“Isn’t it such a 
relief for someone 
to say that?”

If 
this 
reso-

nates at all with 
you, it probably does for two big rea-
sons. The first is that you have prob-
ably lived enough and read enough 
to know that life is a bummer. You 
share in the collective discontent 
with the way life is. The second rea-
son explains why you might not have 
realized that you shared in any “col-
lective discontent”: you, too, have 
long had your discontent suppressed. 
Not only have the people around you 
seldom spoken publicly about what a 
bummer life is, you yourself have sel-
dom spoken about it. Every day when 
you walk out the door and someone 
asks, “How are you?” and you smile, 
saying, “fine” or “good,” you have had 
to deny the fact of your discontent to 
others, and thus denied the fact of it 
to yourself.

But the discontent and its various 

emotional manifestations (sadness, 
anxiety, anger, etc.) didn’t then go 
away. With your help, society has 
suppressed your sadness, anxiety 
and anger deep into your psyche, pre-
venting them from entering the pub-
lic space and allowing them to fester 
inside of you, becoming infected. 
Consequently, you drink too much, 
smoke too much, eat too much, fuck 
too much, unwittingly trying to 
soothe this now gnarly, deep-seated 
discontent when the real solution 
would be to talk about it, or at least 
listen to others talk about it.

Honestly, how often are you fine or 

good? I’m fine or good maybe a quar-
ter of the time, and I don’t consider 
myself an especially unhappy person. 
I’m one of the lucky ones. But I, too, 
smile automatic, phony smiles when 
greeting people on the street, and I 
lie and tell them I’m fine or good.

I’m not necessarily not fine the 

other three-quarters of the time — 
I’ve got decent food to eat, a decent 

place to sleep, etc. — but quite often 
there’s something bothering me 
that I feel uncomfortable talking 
about and uncomfortable confront-
ing even privately. There exists for 
me, and I think for others, too, this 
social pressure not to “bother” peo-
ple with my problems. I think it fits 
in with this ideal of rugged individ-
ualism that we Americans learned 
to embrace from watching too many 
Westerns. “John Wayne doesn’t cry, 
so I don’t either! Chris Kyle doesn’t 
cry, so I don’t either!” OK … so how’s 
that noble self-reliance working out 
for ya?

I, too, often feel unduly burdened 

by other people’s problems when 
they bravely break social custom and 
tell me how they’re really doing. I’m 
already struggling alone with the 
problems that I feel pressured not 
to share or talk about with others, 
so I don’t have any mental energy 
left over for other people’s problems, 
and so, in turn, they don’t have any 
mental energy left over for my prob-
lems; so goes the vicious cycle. But, if 
I did the brave thing and shared my 
burden with others, then I could, in 
turn, share in their burdens. I would 
not only alleviate myself of my dis-
content that has been compounded 
by repeated social interactions as 
well as self-denial, I would alleviate 
the discontent of others as well.

And this is not to say that it’s not 

OK to be miserable, because it is 
OK. You need not always be either 
“fine” or “good.” If you aren’t at least 
occasionally bummed out by being 
a human, you either aren’t a human 
or you aren’t paying attention. Even 
if you have heaps of money, food 
and sex, there is stuff in life about 
which you probably ought be mis-
erable. Don’t be afraid of it; the bad 
stuff will probably enrich your life 
 

experience and you as a person.

Often when I’m unhappy, I feel 

like something’s wrong with me, 
and that makes me even unhappier. 
I read the opening of the Declara-
tion of Independence (always good 
to have a copy handy) and I think 
to myself, “I ought to pursue hap-
piness!” But you don’t always have 
to be happy and you don’t always 
have to pursue happiness. Isn’t it 
such a relief for someone to say that? 
When I’m miserable, let me be mis-
erable. The only thing worse than 
being miserable is being miserable 

and feeling as if you shouldn’t be. 
That makes me frustrated, and then 
I smoke, drink and/or eat too much 
pizza right before bed in order to 
“fix” my misery, and then wake up 
the next morning feeling shitty, and 
then I feel as if I should be happier 
than I am, and I drink too much cof-
fee and the cycle continues. But if, 
when I was unhappy, I was OK with 
feeling unhappy, then I wouldn’t try 
so hard to be happy. Paradoxically, 
that’s the way to be happy: be OK 
with being unhappy.

Thank god for literature, because 

literature (good literature) helps 
us not be so alone with these feel-
ings when the rest of society doesn’t 
want to hear it. Thank god for mov-
ies, too (good movies). These medi-
ums of artistic expression penetrate 
our fleshy masks and speak to our 
lonely feelings of sadness, anxiety 
and anger and show us that other 
people feel like life is a bummer, too. 
We don’t have to explicitly tell any-
one else we feel like the characters 
in the movie or the book, but by the 
fact of our watching the movie or 
reading the book, others can infer 
our secret, lonely dissatisfaction 
with the way life is going.

I wouldn’t want to rob art of its 

fantastic capacity to make us less 
alone with our sadness, anxiety and 
anger, but it needn’t be the exclusive 
site of eradicating loneliness and 
sharing discontent. Let each of us 
reveal the various manifestations of 
our discontent in order to expose the 
collective discontent inside society. 
By alleviating each of our individual 
burdens, we shall alleviate the col-
lective burden. Surely the first step 
to making ourselves happier is con-
fessing the ways we aren’t happy. Of 
course, such a widespread confession 
of unhappiness would be difficult for 
established power and pretentious 
authority whose reign depends on 
everyone pretending that everything 
is awesome. Surely, everything is 
awesome for some people, and those 
people most likely stand to benefit 
from the system as it is: the status 
quo. So for those of us who are dis-
content and dissatisfied, we ought to 
take deliberate measures to change 
the miserable conditions that exist 
on this earth.

Greek life. Two words that have, by them-

selves, the same innocence afforded to them as 
any other. However, when you put those two 
words together, they automatically assume 
an air of negativity. The first stereotypical 
thoughts that people have when they hear the 
words “Greek life” are unfortunately those of 
incessant partying, rape, sexual harassment, 
drinking, hazing, racism and entitlement. And 
because of recent events, Greek life has never 
before been attacked in the way it is now.

With everything going on lately, there have 

been two sides, of sorts, that have sprouted 
up surrounding the topic. The first is that of 
the media and general population: Greek life 
is a menace that fosters humiliating practices 
which need to be ended immediately on every 
level. The second is members of Greek life, who 
feel victimized and generalized by everything 
that has gone on recently, causing them to spout 
off any and all facts about how helpful Greek 
life is, with which I, as a proud member of Beta 
Theta Pi, do not disagree.

However, neither of these sides is very help-

ful in moving forward. They both defend what 
they believe in because they are passionate 
about their beliefs, and there is nothing wrong 
with that. Everyone should be afforded the 
opportunity to defend his or her ideals. How-
ever, in this case, the worst thing that can hap-
pen is dividing us into two sides.

People aren’t really mad at Greek life. People 

aren’t enraged about college students coming 
together in brotherhood or sisterhood. They 
are upset about the horrible acts that are broad-
casted nationwide — events like racist chants, 
reports of sexual assault and rape and even peo-
ple committing suicide. These are the real rea-
sons why people are up in arms. The nation is 
trying to find some sort of outlet for this anger, 
and because the media can paint an easy target 

on Greek life, fraternities and sororities nation-
wide are now under the scrutiny of the societal 
magnifying glass, looking for any excuse to try 
to burn the whole system to the ground. They 
do this because it’s easy to confront something 
physical, like Greek life, and because people 
find it interesting to read about, which helps 
ratings. However, the real problem lies in the 
societal shortcomings and defects that allow 
for these atrocities to happen.

The fact is this: these sorts of tragedies hap-

pen far too frequently at every college campus 
across the nation. Issues like sexual assault and 
mental illness are still considered taboo. The 
problem with our society isn’t Greek life mem-
bers committing terrible acts. The problem 
is that we, as a culture, haven’t worked hard 
enough to get rid of the overarching problems 
that allow people to do these terrible things.

We haven’t supported the survivors of sex-

ual assault as a nation. We have looked down 
upon the events as something terrible with-
out fully realizing the emotional and physi-
cal toll that the survivor must go through, for 
perhaps the rest of their lives, as a result. We 
haven’t made it socially acceptable for some-
one with a mental or physical illness to reach 
out to a friend or ask for help. Instead, they try 
to struggle against it themselves. We haven’t 
educated people enough about personal identi-
ties and how they can be complex and fragile 
at times.

We haven’t done this because we are always 

pointing fingers. The problem with this is that 
the true evil doesn’t care about sides. The only 
way to combat this injustice is through unity, 
understanding and communication. And until 
we learn that, we will never be able to rid these 
evils from our world.

PAUL DEFORD | VIEWPOINT

Divided we fail

Are feminists asking for too 

much? Many men and even some 
women answer this question with 
a definitive “yes.” Critics of the 
feminist movement say that women 
in America have all their funda-
mental rights protected already. 
Still, feminists continue to mobi-
lize, because their ultimate goal of 
equality under the law for both men 
and women has not been met.

Women cannot be equal under 

the law until they are included in the 
process that creates the law. Eleanor 
Roosevelt, first lady and the first 
chair of the United Nations’ Human 
Rights Commission, believed that 
women must be at the table negotiat-
ing policy themselves if their voices 
are to be heard. For this to happen, 
women must be included in all levels 
of government.

At first glance, it seems as if 

women have as much space as men 
to govern and craft policy. Ameri-
can laws do not prohibit women 
from running for office or holding 
executive positions. International 
law explicitly protects women’s 
political rights in the Convention 
on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination 
against 
Women, 

which gives women the right to 
participate in the formulation of 
government policy and to hold 
 

public office.

Despite the apparent opportu-

nity, women are overwhelmingly 
not included in governing bodies. 
Although women make up 50.8 
percent of the nation’s population, 
their representation in public posi-
tions falls far below that.

Rutgers’ Center for American 

Women and Politics portrays the 
discouraging number of women 
in American government. On a 
national scale, women represent 

just 19.4 percent of Congress, leav-
ing the remaining 80.6 percent to 
men. Not to mention that no woman 
has yet held the presidency.

It doesn’t improve dramatically 

on a state level, either. Women hold 
just 24.2 percent of state legislature 
seats. Within the more “presti-
gious” state senates, the percentage 
is even lower. These figures point 
to the harsh reality that men are 
the ones dictating policy-making. 
Frighteningly, still, is that what 
begins with unequal political rep-
resentation becomes unequal law.

Because women do not have as 

great a voice in policy-making, it is 
difficult for them to address laws 
which disproportionately impact 
women. This leads the laws them-
selves to become unequal, often 
widening the gap between equality 
for men and women.

In 2012, when the Michigan Leg-

islature was considering an anti-
abortion bill, there were just 31 
women holding seats. Ultimately, 
it was men who made the decision 
about what would happen with 
women’s bodies, and the few voices 
of women that were available were 
silenced. The New York Daily News 
reported that two female represen-
tatives were barred from speak-
ing on the floor after they used the 
words “vagina” and “vasectomy.”

This serves to demonstrate the 

social inequality that still exists 
between men and women. Male 
legislators punished a woman for 
not speaking the language of law, 
or what is really the language of 
men. By reducing the value of these 
women’s voices, they also reduced 
the value of the women themselves.

Much of the existing inequal-

ity is directly linked to the lack of 
political representation by women. 

Men dominate the policy-making 
fields, despite the fact that they rep-
resent just half the population.

Yet when feminists point to this 

huge disparity, excuses are all that 
follow. Nobel laureate Jody Wil-
liams provided a telling example 
of this. When she asked a UN 
ambassador why so few women 
hold leadership and director-level 
roles within the United Nations, he 
replied that there weren’t enough 
qualified women.

A presumably intelligent and 

well educated man believed that 
not 
enough 
competent 
women 

existed to fulfill the role, though 
evidence says otherwise. Accord-
ing to the Russell Sage Foundation, 
a social science research center, not 
only do women earn more master’s 
degrees than men, they also earn 
more Ph.D.s and an almost equal 
number of professional degrees. 
With these numbers, it is nearly 
impossible to believe that qualified 
women don’t exist for high-level 
government jobs.

The problem is not women’s 

lack of certification, nor is it lack 
of legislation protecting women’s 
rights. Inequality stems from the 
fact that women are not the ones 
writing policy and designing law. 
Without 
female 
representation, 

unequal laws are passed and social 
 

inequality is perpetuated.

It is up to both women and men 

to change this by helping women 
campaign, get on the ballot and 
ultimately win the race. When 
women take their seat at the negoti-
ating table, they can begin to erase 
inequality, and only then can femi-
nists begin to achieve their goal of 
equality under the law.

A flawed system

CSG election process in need of reformation

T

his past week marked the official end to the annual Central 
Student Government election cycle and, yet again, the system 
has shown its weaknesses. After a week of litigation within 

the University Election Commission, Make Michigan retained 
the top seats within student government. Overall, voter turnout 
increased, and all three parties — Make Michigan, The Team and 
the Defend Affirmative Action Party — utilized a variety of tactics to 
try and entice voting participation from a largely apathetic student 
body. That said, voter participation still remained under 25 percent. 
Furthermore, there were unmistakable problems associated with 
campaigning throughout this cycle that are sadly only an addition 
to a long pattern of political pettiness that has become synonymous 
with CSG elections. If CSG hopes to be taken seriously as an authority 
on campus, serious reforms are needed.

In recent memory, litigation has become the 

face of CSG elections. For example, two years ago, 
a lawsuit filed within the UEC that was flimsy, at 
best — photographs were used to demonstrate 
voters were influenced by candidates to vote for 
a specific party — led to the disqualification of 
the presidential and vice presidential candidates 
who received the most votes. Last year, litigation 
did not affect who won, yet it took five days for 
election results to be certified — an excessive 
amount of time.

This year has been no different; both Make 

Michigan and The Team filed suits charging 
each other with campaign violations in 
the hopes of rendering the opposing party 
disqualified from the election. A party can 
be disqualified if it accumulates 10 or more 
demerits, which are handed out by the 
UEC for election code violations. One of 
these violations — levied against The Team 
— resulted in five demerits for dumping 
water over a chalk advertisement on the 
Diag supporting Make Michigan, which the 
UEC qualified as “destruction of campaign 
materials.” The evidence, in this case, is highly 
questionable and even if true, the punishment 
is exorbitant and unreasonable.

On the other hand, The Team filed a suit 

against Make Michigan for harvesting 5,719 
e-mails through a UPetition called “Crush the 
Calendar,” which was created by LSA freshman 
Lauren Siegel, Make Michigan’s campaign 
manager. However, the UEC ruled it could not 
find Make Michigan guilty of a violation because 
“it is possible that she may have reasonably 
believed that the students to whom she sent 
promotional e-mails would be more likely than 
any other student to support Make Michigan.” 
Thus, in a seemingly clear violation of the CSG 
code, the UEC decided not to act at all upon this 
suit because — according to the commission — 
anyone who signed the “Crush the Calendar” 

UPetition was somehow more likely to vote for 
Make Michigan than any other student despite 
this petition having no affiliation with Make 
Michigan whatsoever.

Make Michigan also filed a suit against LSA 

senior Andrew Loeb for harvesting 534 e-mails 
from the Lloyd Hall Scholars Program. However, 
the UEC ruled The Team did not violate their 
harvesting standards. Not only are CSG parties 
resorting to increasingly undemocratic and 
time-wasting tactics, but the body responsible 
for holding candidates and party managers 
accountable appears to allow elections to go on 
with questionable rule enforcement.

The demerit system utilized by the UEC 

needs to be reevaluated. Rather than subjecting 
an entire party’s qualification to 10 demerits, 
allocated by the UEC for violations of policy, 
the demerit system should, instead, be tied to 
vote accumulation — the more demerits a party 
receives, the more votes should get deducted 
from their overall total. Currently, the difference 
between nine and 11 demerits is the difference 
between life and death, even though it is relatively 
easy to accumulate two or more demerits.

Above all else, CSG must return to acting 

as an apolitical body. Students are turned off 
by the constant badgering of campaigners and 
quasi-political rhetoric espoused by candidates 
across the campus. It is no surprise that voter 
turnout — even though it increased this year — 
stands at just 22 percent of the student body.

CSG has an immense capacity to affect 

students in a positive manner. The onus is now 
on our new leaders-elect — LSA junior Cooper 
Charlton, LSA sophomore Steven Halperin 
and the newly elected representatives — to 
effectively guide our campus to a new era of 
student governance, along with a revitalized 
and professional campaign atmosphere. If this 
does not happen, the same embarrassing cycle 
will continue.

STYLE INTERVIEW
Olivia Carrino talks 
fashion industry

University alum 
and Shopbop PR 

associate discusses 

career

By CAROLINE FILIPS

Daily Arts Writer

It’s rare for our realities 

to mimic our dreams. The 
chance of someone uttering “I 
love my job” with conviction 
is even less likely in today’s 
pragmatic workforce. Luckily 
for 
University 
alum 
Olivia 

Carrino, 
PR 
associate 
of 

Shopbop, she found herself 
where she always aimed to be 
by keeping her goals specific, 
aspirations lofty and optimism 
high.

“I kind of fell into PR and 

now that I’ve been doing it 
for three and a half years, it’s 
really exactly where I should 
be,” Carrino said. “I love 
interacting with people; I love 
the face time; I love meeting 
new people.” 

For Carrino, the proverbial 

finish line meant pursuing 
a career in fashion or, more 
specifically, 
achieving 
her 

lifetime goal of working at 
Vogue 
Magazine. 
By 
the 

summer of 2009, before her 
junior 
year, 
she 
landed 
a 

promotions internship at the 
fashion publication, and her 
dreams became a reality. 

“The only place I wanted to 

intern was Vogue magazine, 
and there was no other option,” 
Carrino said.

When she arrived at Condé 

Nast that summer, having the 
University of Michigan on her 
resumé seemed to pair well 
with her sartorial pursuits. 

“The woman that hired me 

for my internship was also a U 
of M alum and she said to me 
on my first day, ‘Well, I knew 
you were going to be smart, 
because you graduated from 
Michigan,’” Carrino recalled.

She 
found 
her 
Vogue 

experience to be a stepping 
stone along her ever-evolving 
career pathway. Though her 
internship on the promotions 
side of the magazine was 
scheduled to last half of the 
summer, she was asked to stay 
for the remainder of the season 
on the magazine’s editorial 
side.

“It led to so many things,” 

Carrino said. “I was very, very 
lucky, but it took a lot of hard 
work to get there.”

With Carrino, her go-getter 

attitude 
manifests 
into 
a 

unique triple threat — one 
part drive, another part work 
ethic and a third her outgoing 
disposition. 

“Whether it was dancing 

competitively or playing soccer 
or going to the University of 
Michigan, I had one goal and 
just kind of chased it until I got 
it,” Carrino said.

It’s 
that 
unchecked 

ambition 
along 
with 
her 

lifelong penchant for fashion 
that 
Carrino 
attributes 
to 

her 
success. 
During 
her 

time at the University, she 
pursued a double major in 
Communications and Spanish, 
dabbled in writing for The 
Michigan Daily’s News section 
and participated in the NOiR 
fashion show her senior year. 

“It’s funny because I think 

a lot of people tend to say, 
‘You know, what I learned in 
college doesn’t really apply 
in my real life,’ but I actually 
feel very different for what I 
do,” Carrino said. “I’ve been 
working on a marketing team 

and in PR and events, and 
really what I learned in my 
communications 
classes 
is 

very, very applicable.”

By 
the 
time 
graduation 

rolled around, Carrino had two 
job offers — full-time positions 
at both Vogue and Shopbop. 
Torn between her childhood 
goal and the exciting prospects 
of a new fashion environment, 
Carrino struggled to come 
to a decision. Ultimately, she 
chose the Shopbop position for 
its e-commerce focus — one 
she decided would endow her 
with a valuable edge for future 
opportunities.

“It felt like the longest 

weekend ever, making that 
decision,” Carrino said. “It 
was funny, it almost felt like 
everything I wanted was right 
in front of my face and I chose 
to go the opposite direction. 
But I think in life you learn 
different things about yourself 
with 
different 
experiences, 

and I felt like my internship 
had given me really great 
experience and exposure in 
the publishing world and I was 
ready to move onto the next 
step.”

At Shopbop in New York 

City, 
there 
is 
no 
typical 

workday for Carrino in the 
constantly evolving landscape 
of e-commerce. Between being 
in and out of meetings, editing 
interviews, editor lunches and 
post-work events, hardheaded 
Carrino is fit for the hectic 
schedule. Along with being 
style-savvy, 
it’s 
imperative 

for fashion PR women to stay 
up-to-date in all facets of the 
media.

“I read WWD everyday; I 

read The Skimm daily; I have 
different Google alerts set 
up,” Carrino said. “I think 
being in PR, you need to stay 
really addressed to current 
events especially, obviously in 
the industry. You need to stay 
current because that’s what PR 
is all about.” 

When asked for sage career 

advice for those who share her 
affinity for fashion, Carrino 
stressed the old adages of being 
yourself and working hard, 
similar to the strong example 
she has set. 

“I really believe you need to 

stay true to yourself and kind 
of not get lost in the glitz and 
glamour of what the fashion 
industry is portrayed to be,” 

she said. “From the outside, 
fashion is all pretty. At the 
other side of the industry there 
are a lot of smart people doing 
a lot of really big things that 
make it run, and I think that 
you need to kind of leave your 
entitlement at the door and be 
ready to work and work.”

Staying 
true 
to 
her 

philosophy 
of 
accepting 

professional 
challenges 
in 

favor of the valuable learning 
experiences 
that 
follow, 

Carrino recently accepted a job 
offer as the U.S. PR Manager 
of MiH Jeans, a denim brand 
based in London.

“After three and a half years 

at Shopbop, I have decided it 
is time to move on,” Carrino 
said. “Though bittersweet, I 
wanted to go brand-specific 
and challenge myself in ways I 
have not yet experienced.”

Though 
Carrino 
has 

experienced success in her 
field, she makes a point to stay 
grounded in an industry often 
seen as superfluous. 

“New York is an interesting 

place 
and 
fashion 
can 
be 

interesting,” 
Carrino 
said. 

“Sometimes I need to remind 
myself I’m not curing cancer 
and 
it’s 
just 
clothes, 
and 

that kind of puts things into 
perspective a little bit.”

‘Going Clear’ shocks

HBO

Don’t be mad at us, Tom Cruise.

By SOPHIA KAUFMAN

Daily Arts Writer

Alex Gibney’s new documen-

tary, 
“Going 
Clear: 
Scientol-

ogy and the Prison of Belief,” is 
mesmerizing. 
Based on Law-
rence Wright’s 
eponymous 
book, it sheds 
light onto the 
strangely 
fas-

cinating 
cult 

that has been 
the source of 
rumors 
and 

half-joking 
references 
in 

American cul-
ture for years. 
But more than just a history of an 
enigmatic group, the documen-
tary tells a captivating story of the 
consequences of human desires; 
desires to be a part of something, 
to bring change, to mean some-
thing as an individual in a world 
populated by billions of people — 
even when swayed by charismatic 
leaders and a tempting ideology. 

The documentary begins with 

snippets of real audio recordings 
of former Church of Scientology 
members answering questions, 
their voices blending together to 
create a discordant soundtrack 
that feels like the beginning of an 
artistic horror film. The Oscar-
winning director constructs his 
narrative by profiling the Church’s 
founder L. Ron Hubbard. Gib-
ney demonstrates a sharp talent 
for pacing from the beginning, 
methodically undermining Hub-
bard’s credibility with each beat. 

Hubbard’s science fiction novels, 
written years before he founded 
the Church, contained many of 
what became the principal tenets 
of Scientology. The foundation on 
which the Church was built con-
sisted of recycled material from 
Hubbard’s “Dianetics,” a novel 
published in 1950. He lied exten-
sively about his World War II ser-
vice, spinning his own story into a 
hero’s tale, insisting that Scientol-
ogy cured him of war wounds — 
ones he never actually suffered. He 
manipulated his wife, threatening 
suicide and homicide to make her 
acquiesce to his demands.

The 
documentary’s 
great-

est strength lies in the camera’s 
unflinching gaze into the eyes of 
former Scientologists who broke 
with the Church. It’s clear these 
ex-members just aim to explain 
themselves — wanting us not only 
to believe them but to sympathize 
with their former selves, whom 
we see triumphantly cheering 
for David Miscavige’s (the leader 
of the Church after Hubbard) 
speeches in grainy old video foot-
age. Their accounts of the attrac-
tiveness of Scientology, an ideology 
that preaches a world without war, 
crime or insanity, are riveting, 
revealing, as stories spill out that 
have been bottled up for years. 

Actors John Travolta and Tom 

Cruise, the two most recogniz-
able names associated with Sci-
entology, are discussed at length. 
Travolta’s 
glassy 
stares 
and 

sharklike smiles, and Cruise’s 
manic convictions in old inter-
views are included in archived 
footage. For faces that have been 
on our screens for years, they are 

startlingly frightening in this 
context.

The most damning stories of the 

Church aren’t those about their 
campaign (which they won) to 
get tax exemptions or even their 
attacks on their critics, but rather 
in the accusations of psychologi-
cal and physical abuse. One former 
member, Sylvia “Spanky” Taylor, 
describes escaping in a getaway 
car from the headquarters of the 
Church after seeing the kind of 
neglect her newborn baby was sub-
jected to. 

Despite 
the 
ex-member’s 

eagerness, the documentary still 
would’ve benefited from more 
pointed questions to its interview-
ees, who were happy to talk with-
out being prodded; it is unclear 
whether many of the followers 
believed in the pseudo-scientific 
aspects or if they were content to 
ignore them. However, the direc-
tions that they take in telling their 
own stories without being prompt-
ed often are absorbing enough to 
keep audiences intrigued.

“Going Clear” doesn’t waste a 

single minute or breath on super-
fluous information or gratuitous 
dramatic devices, relying on facts 
to craft a narrative that is chill-
ing in its honesty. Its persuasive 
power is in the rhythmic reveal of 
fact after fact, culminating in a sol-
idly constructed depiction of the 
church. At the end of two hours, 
it has left us not with an unshake-
able belief in the inherent evilness 
of Scientology, but rather a morbid, 
vaguely repulsed fascination with 
the inner workings of a cult-like 
organization that has managed to 
stay under the radar for so long.

TV REVIEW
‘Roast of Bieber’ not 
 

as funny as intended

Comedy Central 
roast is like its 

subject: not as cool 

as it thinks it is

By HAILEY MIDDLEBROOK

Daily Arts Writer

If there is one pastime that 

has endured through the years: 
gossip. Trash-talk, backstabbing, 
venting to any-
one who will lis-
ten; it happened 
in 19th century 
tea shops and 
it happens over 
salads 
today. 

Everybody talks 
about everyone 
else, making it 
an 
inevitable 

asset of our culture, but also a 
paradoxically invisible one, since 
the key to venting about a per-
son is to say it behind his or her 
back. The trash-talk ends when 
the trashed one joins the group 
— then it’s all smiles and “I love 
yous,” obviously. 

Comedy Central flips this for-

mality on its head by hosting the 
“Roast,” where a cavalry of celeb-
rities is assembled with the mis-
sion to knock down one of their 
own, who is dubbed the “roast-
ee.” Hosted by a “Roast Master,” 
the celebrity roasters take turns 
standing at the mic, taking brutal 
jabs at the roastee while he or she 
sits on stage and takes the heat.

The best roastees are tabloid 

caricatures like Pamela Anderson 
(“Baywatch”) in 2005 or Charlie 
Sheen (“Two and a Half Men”) 
in 2011 — those whose egos prob-
ably should be checked in front of 
a live audience. The best roasters 
are the celebs closest to their vic-

tim, like Seth Rogen (“Pineapple 
Express”) in the 2013 roast of his 
castmate, James Franco. Good 
friends naturally have good dirt 
on each other, making their jokes 
cringingly harsh and all the more 
entertaining.

The heat of the “Roast” fizzles 

out quickly, however, when the 
roasters don’t really know the 
guy they are trying to mock. This 
year, Comedy Central brought 
in “Baby” pop superstar Jus-
tin Bieber, the 21-year-old with 
an estimated net worth of $200 
million, over 46 million Twit-
ter followers and unmeasurable 
swarms of tween fans called 
“Beliebers.” But these scream-
ing preteens aside, everyone and 
their mothers (especially their 
mothers) pretty much agree that 
Bieber’s a cocky little brat — from 
his reportedly paying for a “swag-
ger coach” to getting arrested for 
a DUI in Miami, then later egging 
a neighborhood mansion, Bieber 
has become the media’s favorite 
fallen child star. 

But, everybody knows that. 

As of 2014, the music video for 
“Baby” set a YouTube record for 
the most dislikes of a video, rak-
ing in over four million. So the 
problem with roasting Bieber is 
that it’s too easy, for it’s all been 
said before: He looks like a “les-
bian” and walks like a wannabe 
gangster. We get the picture. 

And despite their best efforts, 
roasters 
Kevin 
Hart 
(“The 

Wedding Ringer”), Snoop Dogg, 
Ludacris, 
Shaquille 
O’Neal, 

Martha Stewart and even Will 
Ferrell, posing as Ron Burgun-
dy from “Anchorman,” could 
not find anything new to tease 
Biebs about. 

As Bieber himself so aptly put 

it: “What do you get when you 
give a teenager $200 million? A 
bunch of has-beens calling you a 
lesbian for two hours.” 

Though Bieber was simply too 

easy of a target, the real high-
lights of the show were when 
the celebrities took jabs at each 
other. Like when stand-up come-
dian Natasha Leggero called out 
Stewart saying, “All these rap-
pers on stage and Martha Stew-
art has done the most jail time.” 
Or when Shaq smashed pint-
sized Hart with, “Kevin is the 
only celebrity with a star on the 
yellow brick road.” 

But the real kicker of the 

night was when Stewart took 
the stage and proceeded to 
scorch her (sort of) wholesome 
image. “You need to settle 
down, bring some balance into 
you life and find a nice gal,” 
Stewart said to Bieber. “Some-
one on your level, someone 
powerful and rich, someone 
you can smoke with, have the 
occasional three way with. I’m 
saying someone who’s a player 
in the boardroom and a freak in 
the bedroom. My final piece of 
advice is — call me!” 

Outrageous, 
cover-your-

mouth mocking will always be 
entertaining, as Comedy Cen-
tral’s “Roast of Justin Bieber” 
proved. But it’s even more deli-
cious when the person being 
bashed has more than 21 years 
of mishaps to dredge out into 
the spotlight.

TV REVIEW
Derivative ‘Loners’ 

By MATT BARNAUSKAS

Daily Arts Writer

There are ubiquitous expecta-

tions placed on almost everyone. 
As “Weird Loners” discusses 
in its opening 
episode, one of 
those expecta-
tions is finding 
love. While it’s 
not as pressing 
as it once was, 
there’s a cer-
tain 
pressure 

for adults to 
find that spe-
cial someone. 
But what about 
those who just can’t figure it out?

The title quartet of “Weird 

Loners” isn’t about overly eccen-
tric individuals who struggle to 
simply exist alongside others. 
Rather, it tells the story of typi-
cal 30-somethings who, for one 
reason or another, are still single 
— seemingly the odd ones out in 
their age group. 

There’s 
Stosh 
(Zachary 

Knighton, “Happy Endings”), 
the self-professed douchebag 
who is introduced as he loses 
his job for having sex with his 
boss’s fiancée. “Is it my fault 
she’s a wild woman?” he ques-
tions. “Did I get her that hit 
of ecstasy?” Kicked out of his 
apartment, Stosh seizes the 
opportunity to live with his 
cousin Eric (Nate Torrence, 
“Hello Ladies”), whose father 
dies next to him while watch-
ing baseball on TV. Eric is the 
most socially awkward, having 
lived with his parents for years. 
But the show steers away from 
making him the typical leech 
forced into the world of adult-
hood. The guy is naïve, yet has 
a job and chose to stay home to 
take care of his parents in old 
age. Therein lies the greatest 
strength of “Weird Loners.” It 
exists in well-worn territory and 
its characters are archetypes, 

but it gives them enough nuance 
to make the show enjoyable even 
when it becomes predictable. 

Such is Eric’s neighbor, Caryn 

(Becki Newton, “Ugly Betty”), 
who tells herself she wants 
stability in an engagement to 
her boyfriend Howard (David 
Wain, “Children’s Hospital”), 
but she finds herself lacking real 
pleasure in a relationship con-
stricted by societal conformity 
for women her age. A cynical 
romantic, Caryn wants some-
thing more in her relationships 
and she can’t really find it.

The only lacking character 

is Zara (Meera Rohit Kumb-
hani, “Black Box”), the emo-
tionally detached, free-spirited 
artist. She avoids commitment, 
as she shrugs off a steady rela-
tionship in her first scene. The 
character’s weakness lies in 
her lack of interaction with 
the other three characters on a 
more personal level. Stosh and 
Eric share a reuniting dynamic 
while Caryn and Stosh have the 
sitcom’s predesignated sexual 
tension that sparks the moment 
the two meet. The pilot creates 
a serviceable dynamic between 
these characters, but Zara feels 
like the odd woman out, used 
mostly for quips. “Passion is 
such a fleeting thing; that’s why 

I like masturbation,” she casu-
ally pronounces. “Me too,” Eric 
responds as the two share a 
high-five, creating the strongest 
connection Zara has to any char-
acter. Caryn and Zara’s interac-
tions together are minimal, so 
it feels especially odd when the 
former asks the latter to move in 
together (oh, the magic of alco-
hol and sitcom tropes).

However, there is good chem-

istry in the foursome, best illus-
trated near the end of the episode 
when they watch a wedding from 
afar. Lip-reading the blushing 
couple’s vows, Stosh, Zara and Eric 
cheer up a recently single Caryn as 
they subconsciously espouse their 
own insecurities about marriage 
and relationships in general. Stosh 
still lives a life of womanizing, 
Zara shuns tradition and Eric just 
has no clue as he concludes, “I now 
pronounce you Malomites. You 
may fist with pride.”

“Weird Loners” slyly com-

ments on several expectations 
people face as they near a cer-
tain age. But the genre also traps 
the show within a degree of 
predictability that at times runs 
counter to its message, making it 
a strength as well as a hindrance 
to a new series that must set 
itself apart in a crowded field of 
similar sitcoms.

SPORTSMONDAY COLUMN
Attitude change 

brings back 

Michigan culture
H

appy 86th birthday, Bo. 
Man, do I have a sur-
prise for you.

Remember your second 

game as 
Michigan’s 
football 
coach, when 
49,684 
people 
watched 
your 
Wolverines 
pummel 
Washington 
at the Big 
House? 
Or the following week, when 
just 15,000 more came for 
the meeting against top-10 
Missouri?

Well, I wish you could have 

been at Michigan Stadium on 
Saturday, when 60,000-plus 
filled the bowl to see the Spring 
Game — a scrimmage, featuring 
a virtual punter! All to catch 
their first glimpse of new coach 
Jim Harbaugh.

Yes, that Jim Harbaugh, 

the one you said would never 
play a down 
for Michigan 
when he 
arrived late 
for his first 
meeting. He’s 
in charge of 
the program 
now, and let 
me tell you, 
he has people 
excited. 
As you wrote in Bo’s 
Lasting Lessons, comparing 
quarterback recruits, Harbaugh 
had “twice the brains and 
10 times the heart,” and he 
has shown both since his 
introduction Dec. 30.

See, Harbaugh and Athletic 

Director Jim Hackett seem to 
have figured out that you don’t 
need fireworks and flyovers 
to sell Michigan football. As 
it turns out, if you stick to 
tradition and put the right man 
in charge, things generally turn 
out pretty well.

“We’ve got to keep our 

expectations (reasonable),” 
Hackett said in a fireside chat 
last week. “They just have to get 
the team right. From the stuff 
I’ve seen, I’m really excited.”

Consider this: The season 

doesn’t begin for five months, 
and there’s already a wait list 
for football tickets. The luxury 
boxes are sold out, too.

That’s not to sing Harbaugh’s 

praises quite yet — he hasn’t 
even coached his first actual 
game in Ann Arbor, after all. 
But you’d be proud of what 
he has done this spring to 
prepare his team for the likes of 
Michigan State and Ohio State. 
(Don’t ask about Notre Dame. 
We don’t want to talk about it.)

The weight room? It 

has been stripped bare of 
everything but the necessities. 
Why? Because, as Harbaugh 

said, “this is work.”

The practices? Because 

every position is up for grabs, 
every drill has become a fierce 
competition. And the winners 
of said drills “get” to run extra. 
Why? Because, according to 
Harbaugh, “the winners get the 
right to get better. The winners 
have the right to condition 
more, to be better football 
players, and the losers have to 
go to the side.”

“You have to buy in,” said 

redshirt freshman defensive 
end Lawrence Marshall on 
Saturday. “When you buy in, 
it shows on the field like it did 
today.”

Just as you treated every 

player equally, Harbaugh 
has adopted that and other 
abnormal practice techniques.

And that’s just the way they 

want it.

Take Shane Morris, 

for instance. As the only 
quarterback on the roster with 
significant in-game experience, 
the junior figured to be the next 
man in line for the job. Instead, 

there are eight 
quarterbacks 
on the current 
roster, with 
another 
arriving soon 
via graduate 
transfer. 
Morris’ 
response?

“You can 

bring in 100 

quarterbacks,” he said. “It’s not 
going to matter to me.”

And, as a result of his 

dedication and improvements, 
Morris will have the edge for 
the starting role entering fall 
camp.

Or take future Wolverine 

defensive back Tyree Kinnel, 
who will join a deep defense 
as a freshman this fall. Upon 
seeing the competition and 
intensity of the unit — which 
forced four turnovers — during 
the Spring Game, he voiced his 
anticipation in a text message 
to the Daily.

“It was great,” Kinnel said. 

“I haven’t been this excited 
about Michigan since the day I 
committed.”

Helmet stickers are 

back. The band will be the 
principal form of pregame 
entertainment, not piped-in 
pop music. The Wolverines will 
even transition back to wearing 
black cleats.

And one recent alumnus of 

the Michigan football program 
told the Daily, “I’m jealous. 
People want to see what 
Harbaugh has been up to.”

Sixty thousand of them 

watched it Saturday afternoon. 
And Bo, you would have been 
proud.

Peppers steps up on defense

After season on the 
sideline, Peppers 
seeing daylight

By ZACH SHAW

Daily Sports Writer

At 
long 
last, 
the 
Jabrill 

Peppers show was on display 
Saturday. And it couldn’t have 
come a moment sooner.

Returning for his second 

season with the program, the 
freshman has grown, learned, 
moved to safety and become 
the vocal leader of the defense, 
bringing 
the 
long-awaited 

excitement to light in Saturday’s 
Spring Game.

The growth comes less than 

a season after exciting fans with 
his talent, only to tantalize those 
same fans with an ambiguous 
injury that relegated him to 
sideline duty for much of the 
forgettable 2014 season.

“He’s been A-plus, he really 

has been, all spring,” said 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh. 
“He’s really just out there 
taking reps in a drill, and he’d 
go through the repetition of the 
drill, and I’d see him back at the 
front of the drill. That’s the kind 
of youngster he is. He’s brought 
great energy and enthusiasm to 
the game, and his play has been 
really good.

“It means a lot to me that he 

wants to keep getting better and 
better … you start to fall in love 
with guys like that.”

Players miss games, even 

seasons, 
all 
the 
time. 
But 

when 
you’re 
the 
Michigan 

football team’s highest-ranked 
recruit since 2006 and draw 
comparisons to 1997 Heisman 
Trophy winner and NFL Pro 
Bowler Charles Woodson, the 
pressure can mount quickly each 
game you don’t produce. Such 
was the case for the redshirt 
freshman cornerback.

But 
while 
fans 
struggled 

to support a team that was 

struggling even more on the field, 
Peppers prepared for what was 
to come. With a new outlook, the 
longtime Michigan fan-turned-
player knew that he would 
take full advantage of his next 
opportunity, whenever it was.

“No one’s going to feel sorry 

for you at this point,” Peppers 
said. “Yeah, I got hurt, so 
what? I’ve still got to be a great 
teammate, got to help the guys 
in any way I can. It’s just about 
maturing.

“That made me take a step 

back and look at life and see, 
‘Wow, this can actually be taken 
away from me, so don’t take 
anything for granted,’ and that’s 
how I’m moving forward.”

Once healed, the first step of 

moving forward was for Peppers 
to become a leader. Moving to 
the safety position, a role he 
likens to the quarterback of the 
defense, Peppers not only had to 
recover and develop physically, 
but mentally as well.

“Jabrill’s doing a great job,” 

said senior wide receiver Jehu 
Chesson. “The kid is just so 
energetic, his passion for the 
game is unbelievable. We need 

guys like that because energy is 
contagious, positive and negative.

“You can look at a couple 

stretches when you’re down in 
the game, you need someone to 
come and pick everybody up. 
He’s one of those guys.”

As Peppers’ skillset grew, so 

did the pressure. Still among 
the team leaders in raw talent, 
a fanbase desperate for wins is 
looking to the young player to 
deliver — not years down the 
road, but right now.

That was clear from one of 

the game’s opening plays. Just 
minutes into the game, Peppers 
made his first tackle of the game. 
Though it was an intrasquad 
scrimmage full of turnovers, big 
gains offensively and even more 
prolific tackles, the play drew 
some of the largest cheers from 
the estimated 60,000 fans in 
attendance.

“I noticed that, but there’s 

no pressure if you’re prepared,” 
Peppers said. “I block out the 
crowd, and I’m just doing what 
I love doing and have been doing 
since I was younger, so there’s 
really no pressure at all.”

Later on in the game, Peppers 

had a chance to make an even 
bigger play. With plenty of open 
field in front of him, the safety 
tracked down an errant pass, 
ready to make a game-changing 
play fans have already come to 
expect.

Instead he dropped the ball, 

coming away empty-handed and 
agitated.

“I tried to start running 

before I could pick it,” he said. 
“You can’t do that. You’ve got 
to stick to the fundamentals. I 
told the team that one’s on me, 
didn’t really get a chance to 
make another play, but you live 
and learn.

“That’s what separates the 

good players from great players. 
That would’ve changed the game. 
I had daylight in front of me.”

Despite missing on the play, 

the daylight remains in front 
of Peppers. After the game, 
Peppers was wearing his high 
school state championship ring. 
The trinket serves as a reminder 
of his successful past, but also a 
sign of what’s on the team’s mind 
moving forward.

“Many 
more 
to 
come,” 

Peppers said with a laugh.

‘M’ dominates twice in Indiana

By BETELHEM ASHAME

For the Daily

The Michigan women’s tennis 

team is used to dominating 
opponents at home in the Varsity 
Tennis Center, but this weekend, 
the Wolverines took their home 
facility’s magic touch with them 
on the road.

Michigan traveled to Indiana 

to take on two Big Ten opponents, 
Purdue 
(3-3 
Big 
Ten, 
10-5 

overall) and Indiana (2-4, 11-7), 
and 
thoroughly 
overpowered 

both 
teams. 
After 
winning 

both matches emphatically by 
scores of 7-0, the 14th-ranked 
Wolverines are in great shape 
in 
the 
conference 
with 
an 

undefeated record.

“It’s 
definitely 
a 
huge 

confidence booster,” said senior 
Sarah Lee. “Purdue and Indiana 
are probably the best teams that 
we’re going to play in the Big Ten 
this year, so we’re really, really 
excited that we were able to play 
as well as we did. We’re also 
really excited about the future 
because we feel like we have a 
little bit more in us. Things are 
looking good right now.”

The Wolverines (8-0, 17-3) 

started strong Saturday against 
the Boilermakers, earning the 
doubles point with wins at the 
No. 1 and No. 2 positions. The 
No. 2 pair of Lee and junior Ronit 
Yurovsky jumped out to a 6-1 lead 
en route to an 8-2 win.

Michigan’s No. 1 duo of senior 

Emina Bektas and freshman Alex 
Najarian had a bit of a tougher 
time against Purdue’s team of 
Tess Bernard-Feigenbaum and 
Daniela Vidal, ranked No. 1 
nationally. With a 7-4 lead and 
match point seemingly in their 
reach, 
Bektas 
and 
Najarian 

watched the set seemingly slip out 
of their hands as Purdue battled 
back and won three straight 
games to force a tiebreaker.

But the duo was able to bounce 

back and secure an 8-7 win.

“We did a good job yesterday 

of sticking together when things 
got tough,” Bektas said. “A lot 
of times when those situations 
happen, I can get kind of 
negative, and that doesn’t really 
help us out. But I think we did a 
good job of focusing and checking 

in with each other to know that 
we were going to be okay and we 
were going to pull it out. I think 
the fact that we were able to stay 
positive really helped us out.”

In singles play, five out of the 

six matches were decided in 
straight sets.

Bektas struck first, dropping 

just three games on her way 
to defeating Vidal, her No. 1 
opponent. No. 4 Lee and No. 2 
Yurovsky followed suit, beating 
their opponents, 6-3, 6-4 and 6-4, 
6-3, respectively, to clinch the 
win for Michigan.

Sunday 

got off to an 
even 
brighter 

start for the 
Wolverines in 
the 
doubles 

matches when 
Bektas 
and 

Najarian made 
quick work of 
the opposition, 
winning 
8-0 

over their Hoosier counterparts.

“It felt really good,” Bektas 

said. “I think today we played 
a really strong match. We were 
really aggressive and usually our, 
coach Ronni (Bernstein), tells us 
to focus on the basics, so we did a 
good job of focusing on our serves 
and picking up on our returns 
and volleys. It was really good for 
us today.”

After a tougher battle against 

Indiana’s No. 2 team, Lee and 
Yurovsky managed to come away 
with an 8-6 win and the doubles 
point for the second straight day.

“It was a little tough today,” 

said 
Michigan 
coach 
Ronni 

Bernstein. “I don’t think they 
played their best. (Saturday) 
they played a little bit better, but 
they grinded it out and competed 
hard, and that’s going to be the 
key. You’re not always going to 
feel great every day, but they did 
a good job of figuring it out and 
getting us the doubles point today, 

because 
we 

needed it to get 
us going.”

Michigan 

continued 
to 

find success in 
the singles, led 
by No. 1 Bektas, 
who followed 
up Saturday’s 
impressive 
performance 

with a 6-2, 6-2 win.

“My recent singles play gave 

me a lot of confidence coming 
into this weekend,” Bektas said. 
“I’ve been trying to play my game 
by coming to the net and being 
aggressive, and I was able to do 
that pretty successfully. It has 
helped a lot.”

Another 
Wolverine 
who 

has had a good run of singles 

play 
lately 
is 
Lee. 
After 

Saturday’s straight-set victory, 
she struggled initially to take 
control of the match. She fell 
behind 4-1 in the first set and 
3-0 in the second set, but on both 
occasions, she was able to turn 
the sets around to secure a 6-4, 
6-4 win.

“It helped a bit in the second 

set, knowing that in the first set I 
was able to pull the first one out 
after being down three games,” 
Lee said. “My opponent played 
pretty well in order to get that 
lead off of me. It took a little bit of 
persistence on my end and doing 
what I’m good at doing, which 
is stepping in and seeking the 
ball early and keeping focused. 
I just had to figure it out and be 
persistent.”

After Bektas, freshman Mira 

Ruder-Hook became the second 
Wolverine to claim a win, making 
her mark by defeating her No. 
5 opponent Sarah Baron, 6-4, 
6-0 to run the team score to 3-0. 
Then, Lee and Yurovsky won 
nearly simultaneously to clinch 
the win for the Wolverines.

With the two victories this 

weekend to add to its resume, 
Michigan 
has 
now 
won 
11 

consecutive matches. Confidence 
and team morale are running 
high, and the timing is perfect 
with the Big Ten Tournament on 
the horizon.

AMANDA ALLEN/Daily

Senior Emina Bektas won both her doubles and singles matches, each against Purdue’s Daniela Vidal.

job of sticking 
together when 

things got tough.”

Michigan stays hot, wins series

The Wolverines 
take two games 

over defending Big 

Ten champs

By DANNY VARGOVICK

Daily Sports Writer

The wins just keep on coming.
Last weekend, the Michigan 

baseball team (4-5 Big Ten, 18-13 
overall) won its series against 
Maryland, the preseason Big 
Ten favorite. This weekend, the 
Wolverines took their series 
against Indiana, the defending 
Big Ten champion, splitting 
the 
Saturday 
doubleheader, 

7-3, 11-13, before winning the 
deciding game Sunday, 4-3, in 
Bloomington.

“We’ve taken an approach 

the last couple weeks that our 
backs are against the wall and 
we’re going to fight our way 
out of it, and that’s what we’ve 
done,” said Michigan coach Erik 
Bakich.

The deciding game was a 

nailbiter. 
Freshman 
closer 

Bryan Pall retired the side in 
the eighth inning, and then 
struck out the first batter in the 
ninth. He allowed a solo homer 
to cut the lead to one, but then 
struck out the next two batters 
to 
preserve 
the 
Wolverine 

victory.

Bakich had all the confidence 

in the world in his freshman 
closer, even after the home run.

“I knew we were in good 

shape,” Bakich said. “I never 
had any doubt whatsoever, and 
I don’t think any of our players 
did either.”

It 
was 
left-hander 
Brett 

Adcock, however, who laid the 
groundwork for the victory.

The sophomore, who has 

struggled with walks this year, 
gave the Hoosiers (2-6, 18-10) 
only one free pass and one run 
in six innings of work.

“I 
attacked 
them 
with 

fastballs, moving it inside and 

outside, and worked off that 
with my off-speed pitches,” 
Adcock said. “It was big to 
only give up one walk because 
their offense starts going when 
pitchers make mistakes.”

Saturday, 
junior 
right-

hander 
Jacob 

Cronenworth 
was 
just 
as 

impressive 
in 

his start in the 
first game.

In his second 

collegiate start, 
he also went 
six

and 
allowed 

only one run. 
He threw 76 
pitches as he continued to build 
his 
arm 
strength, 
allowing 

five hits, striking out five and 
walking two.

The one low point in the 

weekend was freshman right-
hander Ryan Nutof’s start in the 
second game on Saturday. He 
allowed six runs — five earned 

— and his earned-run average 
ballooned from 2.93 to 3.74.

“He 
pitched 
well 
— 
he 

pitched just like he pitched 
last weekend,” Bakich said. 
“It just so happened that the 
pitches that he threw, they put 

some quality 
at-bats 
together. 
Credit 
their 

players 
for 

hitting some 
quality 
pitches.”

Still, 

Bakich 
was 

thrilled with 
how his team 
almost pulled 

out an implausible win in the 
unlikeliest of situations.

“Even when we were down 

13-4, our guys didn’t stop 
fighting,” Bakich said. “That 
was something I came away 
from very proud of, the way our 
guys never quit.”

Senior centerfielder Jackson 

Glines, who leads the team 
in hitting, had just two hits 
on the weekend. In his stead, 
Cronenworth, sophomore right 
fielder Carmen Benedetti, and 
recent returnee junior infielder 
Travis Maezes stepped up.

In 
game 
one, 
Benedetti 

collected three hits and one 
walk while scoring two runs.

In game two, the trio reached 

base a combined eight times 
while scoring four times and 
collecting 
eight 
RBI. 
Two 

of those RBI came in the 
first inning, when Benedetti 
homered, plating Cronenworth.

In 
the 
third 
game, 

Cronenworth, 
Maezes 
and 

Benedetti each reached base 
three times. Benedetti again 
went deep on a two-run shot, 
this time scoring Maezes.

“We had a lot of timely hits, 

two out RBIs,” Bakich said. 
“Just up and down the lineup, it 
was a good team win.”

After a slow start to Big Ten 

play, Michigan is back on track.

Wolverines take 
battle for Big Ten

By TED JANES

Daily Sports Writer

The best of the Big Ten squared 

off in Minneapolis, and at first, it 
seemed like the home team would 
run away with the series.

A slow start to the weekend 

gave the Michigan softball team 
(7-2 Big Ten, 33-6 overall) its 
worst loss of the season, as the 
fourth-ranked Wolverines fell 
9-1 in a mercy-rule defeat to No. 
14 Minnesota (6-3 Big Ten, 30-7 
overall).

But Michigan regrouped Satur-

day as senior left-handed pitcher 
Haylie Wagner stepped into the 
circle and earned a 9-4 victory 
in the second game of the series. 
Wagner was also a force in the 
batter’s box, hitting a two-run 
shot to the right-field scoreboard 
for her first home run of the year.

Sunday, the Golden Gophers 

brought back their strongest 
pitcher in Sara Groenewegen, 
who gave Michigan all sorts of 
problems in the series opener, 
tallying 10 strikeouts.

In the circle for Michigan was 

sophomore pitcher Megan Betsa. 
Despite giving up one run, Betsa 
totaled nine strikeouts on the 
day, a stark contrast from Fri-
day’s game when she allowed 
nine hits and walked five batters.

“Minnesota is a very aggres-

sive team,” said Michigan coach 
Carol Hutchins. “(Betsa) really 
kept us in. We struggled Friday to 
do much at the plate, and the key 
to beating a good pitcher is hav-
ing a good pitcher. (On Sunday,) 
she held a really potent offense 
and did a nice job.”

In the rubber match, the Wol-

verines connected with their bats 
in the top of the sixth inning, as a 
six-run rally sealed the 9-1 victory.

Unlike Friday, Michigan found 

a way to frustrate Groenewegen. 
A sizzling grounder from junior 
infielder Sierra Lawrence skid-

ded past the shortstop to bring 
in sophomore infielder Lindsay 
Montemarano. Another single 
by junior second baseman Sier-
ra Romero scored Lawrence, 
stretching the lead to 5-1.

After Romero’s hit, the Golden 

Gophers finally took Groenewe-
gen out of the circle, and in doing 
so, sacrificed their best asset.

“She worked the corners a lot,” 

Wagner said. “She had a good off-
speed pitch, and she mixed up the 
seams.”

After the pitching change, 

it was all downhill for Minne-
sota. Sophomore outfielder Kelly 
Christner ripped a single to right 
field, junior outfielder Kelsey 
Susalla was hit by the next pitch 
and senior catcher Lauren Sweet 
notched a grounder that was mis-
handled by the second baseman, 
scoring Romero and Christner. 
The onslaught continued, and by 
the end of the inning, Michigan 
led by eight runs.

“We were amped up that 

we hit Groenewegen out of the 
game,” Montemarano said. “We 
were getting hits and trusted 
the game plan. We were the ones 
throwing the punches.”

Montemarano’s big afternoon 

was capped off by an RBI double 
that was part of the sixth-inning 
rally. She drew a pair of walks 
and also posted two runs and two 
hits on the day, one of many Wol-
verines contributing offensively.

In the bottom of the sixth, 

with one out, Betsa missed low 
and wide with the 12th pitch of 
an at-bat to load the bases. Just 
two outs away from ending the 
series, another long at-bat result-
ed in Betsa’s ninth strikeout, and 
the Wolverines came closer to 
mercying the Gophers.

An infield popup to freshman 

first baseman Taylor Swearingen 
ended the game, and the run rule 
kicked in, concluding the week-
end with another Michigan win.

SOFTBALL

‘M’ earns first Big Ten win

By DANIEL TACHNA-FRAM

Daily Sports Writer

This year, the Michigan men’s 

lacrosse team has preached 
resilience. The mantra might 
just have saved the Wolverines’ 
season as they came up with 
a 
crucial 

10-8 home 
win 
over 

Rutgers on 
Sunday.

Michigan (1-1 Big Ten, 5-5 

overall) is currently sitting 
in fourth in the conference 
standings, and with just the 
top four teams advancing to the 
inaugural Big Ten Tournament, 
Sunday’s game against fifth-
place 
Rutgers 
had 
all 
the 

makings of a must-win game for 
both squads.

Last Sunday, the Wolverines 

suffered a 13-4 drubbing at the 
hands of Maryland in their 
Big Ten opener. It would have 
been easy to let the loss to the 
Terrapins deflate the team and 
derail the rest of the Big Ten 
season, but Michigan managed 
to 
right 
the 
ship 
against 

Rutgers.

Freshman attacker PJ Bogle 

opened the scoring for Michigan 
six minutes into the game. 
Sophomore attacker Ian King 
added to the early lead with a 
goal in transition less than a 
minute later, when goalkeeper 

Gerald 
Logan 
corralled 
a 

Rutgers shot, brought the ball 
halfway up the field and dished 
it off to King.

King 
didn’t 
stop 
there, 

though, scoring three more 
goals in his first action in over 
a month after coming off a foot 
injury.

“It’s awesome,” King said. 

“It’s the kind of thing you 
dream of every day (when 
you’re out).”

Junior attacker Kyle Jackson 

closed out Michigan’s scoring in 
the first quarter with a rocket 
past the Scarlet Knights goalie, 
stretching the lead to 3-0.

From there, Michigan began 

to stumble. Pressured by two 
Rutgers 
attackers, 
redshirt 

sophomore defenseman Charlie 
Keady rolled the ball behind 
him for a turnover, which led 
to an easy goal for the Scarlet 
Knights late in first quarter.

The 
Wolverines 
saw 

themselves outscored 4-1 in the 
second quarter and ultimately 
trailed at halftime, 5-4.

After 
coughing 
up 
the 

lead, the resiliency that has 
characterized the Wolverines 
this season surfaced in the 
third quarter as they took back 
control of the game. King’s 
second goal of the day quickly 
tied the game at five just two 
minutes into the third quarter, 
and junior midfielder Riley 

Kennedy added another a few 
minutes later to give Michigan 
the lead once again. It was 
short-lived, though, as Rutgers 
responded 16 seconds later to 
tie the game at six.

That’s when Jackson took 

over for the Wolverines. He 
scored back-to-back goals in the 
third quarter to put Michigan 
on top for good.

King 
drove 
the 
dagger 

through the Scarlet Knights 
when, 
with 
one 
minute 

remaining in the third quarter, 
he scored his third and fourth 
goals of the game just seven 
seconds apart. Rutgers added 
two goals in the fourth quarter 
while 
holding 
Michigan 

scoreless, 
but 
the 
Scarlet 

Knights couldn’t overcome the 
deficit.

“This team stays hungry,” 

said Michigan coach John Paul. 
“They handle adversity pretty 
well. They come back ready 
to work every week no matter 
what 
happened 
the 
week 

before.”

After losing some of its 

momentum 
in 
the 
fourth 

quarter Sunday, Michigan will 
face a stern test against Ohio 
State. The Buckeyes will likely 
test the Wolverines’ resiliency 
yet again, as the team looks to 
continue progressing toward 
its ultimate goal of a Big Ten 
Tournament appearance.

Michigan drops heartbreaker

Duquesne scores 
late goal to down 

Wolverines at 

Michigan Stadium 

By DANIEL TACHNA-FRAM

Daily Sports Writer

Sunday, 
Duquesne 
scored 

the first goal and the last one, 
downing the Michigan women’s 
lacrosse 
team, 
11-10, 
in 
a 

heartbreaking, 
back-and-forth 

battle.

That 

first 
goal 

set the tone 
for the rest of a disappointing 
afternoon for the Wolverines.

“We wanted to come out and 

set the tone and play a much 
more upbeat, aggressive game,” 
said Michigan coach Jennifer 
Ulehla.

The turning point of the 

game came with 16 minutes 
left to play in regulation and 
Michigan nursing an 8-7 lead. 
Sophomore goalie Allison Silber 
saved a shot and gained control 
of the ball. The Duke defense 
elected not to pressure Silber, 
allowing her to hold the ball 
and give her defense time to 
rest. After about 30 seconds, 
Silber made an ill-advised pass 
about 30 yards downfield that 
was picked off by a Duquesne 

attacker with nothing but open 
field between her and the net. 
The play allowed the Dukes to 
tie the game and shifted the 
momentum clearly in their 
favor.

The game started close, and it 

stayed that way, as neither team 
managed to open up more than a 
two-goal lead. 
One of those 
two-goal 
leads 
came 

early in the 
first half when 
Michigan 
responded to 
the 
Dukes’ 

opening goal 
with three of 
its own, the 
final of which 
came from sophomore attacker 
Jess Angerman, who finished 
the day with a hat trick.

“Today I was obviously lucky 

because my teammates were 
able to find me,” Angerman 
said. “Just the way the defense 
worked with me playing behind 
the cage I was able to get some 
looks.”

When Duquesne battled back 

to make it 3-2 midway through 
the first half, the Wolverines 
quickly responded with another 
goal and it seemed like they 
would manage to stay in control 
of the game. But that reality 
quickly subsided, and the Dukes 
dominated the second part of 

the first half by scoring three 
consecutive goals to take the 
lead, 5-4.

Seconds 
before 
the 
half 

expired, sophomore midfielder 
Anna 
Schueler 
scored 
an 

equalizer to send the teams to 
the locker room knotted at five 
apiece.

In the first 

five minutes of 
the second half, 
Angerman 
sandwiched 
her 
second 

and 
third 

goals 
of 
the 

game 
around 

a 
Duquesne 

goal scored off 
a penalty shot. 
Less 
than 
a 

minute after Angerman’s third 
goal of the afternoon, Duquesne 
responded with a goal to tie the 
game at seven.

Michigan notched two quick 

goals 
following 
the 
Silber 

blunder, but the Dukes quickly 
responded with two of their own 
to tie the game once again.

Finally, 
after 
setting 
the 

tone for much of the afternoon, 
Duquesne scored the last goal of 
the game in the final minutes.

“We 
never 
really 
put 
it 

together,” Ulehla said. “We’d 
make a stop on defense, then 
we’d turn the ball over. That has 
been a constant that we’ve been 
struggling with all season.”

“That has been 
a constant that 

we’ve been 

struggling with.”

Defense rules Spring Game

By MAX BULTMAN

Daily Sports Editor

Technically speaking, the Blue 

team topped the Maize team, 
7-0. But the real winner of the 
Michigan football team’s 2015 
Spring Game was the defense, 
and it wasn’t even close.

Even aside from the fact there 

was only one touchdown scored 
in the game, both the Maize and 
the Blue teams looked mostly 
disjointed on offense. And while 
much of that can be attributed 
to a team still familiarizing itself 
with the playbook, the depth of 
Michigan’s defense made things 
even harder on its offense.

The Blue team, for instance, 

averaged 0.7 yards per carry … 
and won.

“It’s been impressive,” said 

fifth-year 
senior 
linebacker 

Desmond Morgan. “All spring, 
I think the defense has really 
stepped up in a lot of ways. We 
pride ourselves on getting a lot 
better than what we were, even 
last season.”

The Wolverines allowed 22.4 

points per game last season, 
already an impressive figure good 
for 27th in the nation. But with the 
talent they return, highlighted by 
a linebacking corps that includes 
Morgan and senior Joe Bolden, 
they could be even better.

That started Saturday. Bolden 

led all players with 13 tackles for 
the Maize team, three of them 
for loss, while Morgan had four 
tackles and an interception for 
the Blue team.

More importantly, they each 

anchored units that snuffed 
out runs and hawked balls. 
The defenses came away with 
four total turnovers, a striking 
contrast 
to 
the 
one 
total 

touchdown. And even then, the 
Blue team’s lone score came when 
junior quarterback Shane Morris 
exploited 
a 
clear 
mismatch, 

hitting 
redshirt 
sophomore 

receiver Jaron Dukes in stride 
over the top of senior Dennis 
Norfleet, who just recently began 

working as a nickel cornerback.

While it’s easy to blame an 

offense 
that 
ranked 
among 

the nation’s worst last season, 
redshirt 
freshman 
Jabrill 

Peppers is less inclined to do so.

“Our offense is actually very, 

very 
good,” 

Peppers said. 
“It’s 
just, 

offense takes a 
little longer to 
develop than 
defense. 
Not 

to mention our 
defense, we’re 
playing 
out 

of our minds 
right now.

“The 

game plan, the play calls are so 
simple, it just let’s us play without 
thinking. When you play without 
thinking, you’re just that much 
more instinctual. You’re making 
that much more plays. You’re 
having that much more fun.”

Peppers 
had 
four 
tackles 

Saturday, but seemed to be 
around the ball all game, enjoying 
his transition to safety. He said he 
switched positions because he 
liked to ‘hit more,’ and it showed.

He flew to the ball, taking 

advantage of his new position and 
a supporting cast that enhanced 
his freedom even further.

If there were players out 

of position, they went largely 
unseen, 
whether 
that 
was 

because 
a 

teammate 
covered 
the 

mistake 
or 

because 
the 

offense failed to 
exploit it. Either 
way, the unit’s 
cohesiveness 
on both teams 
opened 
up 

opportunities 
for playmakers 

to emerge at the positions with 
question marks.

At defensive end, it was 

redshirt 
freshman 
Lawrence 

Marshall 
and 
senior 
Royce 

Jenkins-Stone wreaking the most 
havoc. They played on opposite 
teams, but Marshall came away 
with a sack and 1.5 tackles for 
loss, and Jenkins-Stone had a 
sack and 2.5 tackles for loss.

Beyond those two, redshirt 

junior Chris Wormley generated 

significant pressure, racking up 
five tackles but affecting even 
more plays.

“(Wormley) provided some 

really good pass rush on the 
inside,” said Michigan coach Jim 
Harbaugh. “If there’s any way 
we can get pass rush from a four-
man line, that’s what we need to 
do. We need that improvement. 
The edge will come, but I thought 
we had a good interior pass rush 
today.”

Still, the pressure Wormley 

and 
others 
generated 
came 

against two sets of offensive lines 
that didn’t look sharp.

It really isn’t shocking that 

Michigan’s 
veteran 
defense 

outshined an offense that’s still 
learning the playbook. In fact, 
that lack of surprise is as big a 
positive as any moving into the 
summer.

“I think it’s something where 

we both tipped our hats to each 
other at the end of the game 
saying, ‘Hats off to the defense. 
Good job, guys,’ ” Morgan said.

But while half of the defense 

followed that exchange with a 
steak dinner, a hat tip was as good 
as it got for the others.

Pasta or steak?

By MAX COHEN

Managing Sports Editor

The man of the moment for 

the Michigan football program 
spent much of the team’s Spring 
Game staying out of the way. Jim 
Harbaugh hovered about 20 yards 
behind the line of scrimmage on 
each play, his hands either on his 
hips or his knees as the pen he 
wore around his neck dangled in 
the wind.

His 
interaction 
with 
his 

players was limited. He walked 
toward the line of scrimmage 
between plays, sometimes to 
peek into the conversation in the 
huddle, other times to offer his 
players words of encouragement. 
Redshirt 
freshman 
defensive 

end Lawrence Marshall said 
Harbaugh hardly communicated 
with the defensive line at all.

Harbaugh 
aimed 
to 
stay 

impartial throughout the contest, 
purposefully 
refraining 
from 

contributing to the discussions 
that planned the numerous trick 
plays attempted during the game. 
The intensity fans have come 
to expect from Harbaugh was 
largely absent. The vast majority 
of plays elicited little reaction 
from the hyper-competitive head 
coach.

That wasn’t the case for his 

players. 
Redshirt 
freshman 

safety Jabrill Peppers jumped 
up and down, flapping his arms 
in frustration after a missed 
interception 
in 
the 
second 

quarter. When junior quarterback 
Shane Morris threw the game’s 
only 
touchdown 
to 
redshirt 

sophomore wide receiver Jaron 
Dukes, the offense’s celebration 
would have been worthy of a 
regular-season game.

The 
excitement 
was 
not 

without cause. For its postgame 
meal, the winning team received 
steak, while the losing team 
would have to settle for pasta.

The motivational ploys of 

Harbaugh’s 
staff 
throughout 

the 
spring 
have 
been 
well 

documented. At the end of every 
practice, either the offense or the 
defense emerges as the winner. 
The winning side runs gassers, 
while the losing team is forced to 
sit and watch. Though the players 
were intrigued by Harbaugh’s 
methodology at first, they quickly 
bought in.

“You have to buy in, and when 

you buy in, it shows on the field 
like it did today,” Marshall said.

Marshall, who recorded a 

thumping sack of Morris in the 
game’s second quarter, wore a 
gray sweatshirt with the moniker 
“Ball Hawk” across the front to 
his postgame media presser. It 
was emblematic of an another 
incentive 
for 
the 
Wolverine 

defense.

“In practice, you knock the 

ball down, you rush the passer, 
cause a fumble — you get one of 
these shirts,” Marshall said.

The 
sweatshirts 
were 

defensive 
coordinator 
D.J. 

Durkin’s idea. When a defensive 
player makes a play in practice 
like the ones Marshall described, 
the coaching staff makes a point 
of recognizing him in front of his 
teammates.

“It kind of pushes you a little 

bit harder to focus on some of 
those things that maybe if it 
wasn’t recognized as much you 
wouldn’t notice or pay attention 
to as much,” said fifth-year senior 
linebacker Desmond Morgan.

When Saturday’s defensive 

struggle ended, it was once again 
time to celebrate the winners. 
Morris threw his arms up into 
the air as he made his way off 
the field. Harbaugh offered brief 
congratulations to the winning 
coach, offensive coordinator Tim 
Drevno, before running into the 
tunnel alone.

Dinner 
was 
waiting, 
and 

the winning team was ready to 
receive its due. It had been all day.

“I made sure I ate enough 

spaghetti this morning so I didn’t 
have to eat it later on,” Dukes 
said.

Morris leads QB battle

Sophomore outplays 
Malzone, holds edge 

after spring

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

Junior 
quarterback 
Shane 

Morris 
gave 
his 
handoffs, 

stood in the pocket and made 
his throws early in his second 
Spring Game at Michigan.

And then he took his first hit, 

and things really got going.

“It’s awesome — it’s football,” 

Morris said later. “I get tackled 
in football games. I hope I would 
get tackled in practice. I’ve been 
live all spring practice. We do 
third-down 
drills, 
I’m 
live. 

Being live in the pocket is part of 
being quarterback and playing 
the game of football. It doesn’t 
bother me at all.”

In the heat of a quarterback 

battle, Michigan coach Jim 
Harbaugh let the quarterbacks 
be hit in Saturday’s Spring 
Game at Michigan Stadium. 
He let his candidates — Morris, 
early enrollee Alex Malzone 
and redshirt freshman Wilton 
Speight — play it out on the field 
all spring.

When camp closed Saturday, 

Harbaugh had what he wanted: 
a leader.

“If I look at it overall over 

spring ball, Shane would be 
ahead,” Harbaugh said. “The 
competition will rage on, though, 
starting tomorrow. Into April, 
and into May, and certainly into 
June, July and August.”

There’s 
no 
doubt 
the 

competition will remain fierce, 
but Morris ended the day as 
the frontrunner. He completed 
11 of 24 passes for 135 yards, 
an interception and the game’s 
only touchdown. Malzone, by 
contrast, was 15-for-27 for just 
95 yards and two interceptions.

The two signal callers played 

the whole game for the Blue and 
Maize teams, respectively.

Morris, the more experienced 

of the two, used more of the 
playbook as the game went on, 

throwing down the sidelines to 
redshirt junior wide receiver 
Amara Darboh, who finished 
with four catches for 75 yards. 
He was close on a number of 
other deep balls but overthrew 
them.

“I thought Shane played well, 

played with really good courage 
in the pocket,” Harbaugh said. 
“I think he’ll come out of this 
feeling good about the way he 
played, and he’ll build some 
good confidence.”

Meanwhile, 
Malzone 
was 

limited mostly to short screen, 
hitch and out routes. His longest 
completion of 21 yards was on 
a catch-and-run to Chesson 
after 
junior 

cornerback 
Jourdan 
Lewis jumped 
the route but 
missed 
the 

interception.

Harbaugh 

said the game 
was 
a 
good 

learning 
experience 
for the early 
enrollee 
from 
Birmingham 

(Michigan) Brother Rice High 
School.

“Anything’s good for him,” 

Harbaugh said. “He’s so young. 
He should be in high school right 
now. He’s out here competing in 
11-on-11 football. The game, the 
environment, the situation — that 
is valuable, valuable experience.”

Morris said the players joke 

around with Malzone, telling 
him to “close the yearbook.” But 
even that is premature.

Malzone reminds them he 

hasn’t gotten a high school 
yearbook yet.

Still, 
he 
has 
five 
weeks 

under his belt of learning the 
playbook and getting to know 
the receivers, an effort that will 
continue this summer.

“If you had one quarterback, 

you would obviously spend a lot 
of time with that quarterback,” 
Chesson said. “In theory, you 
have to spend a lot of time with 
every single quarterback. So 
that’s what we do.”

Turnovers were an issue for 

both 
quarterbacks. 
Malzone 

threw the first interception 
on a deep throw down the left 
sideline. 
Redshirt 
freshman 

wide receiver Maurice Ways 
appeared to have control of it, 
but senior safety Jarrod Wilson 
jarred it loose, and redshirt 
freshman Brandon Watson came 
up with it.

Morris returned the favor 

three plays later when his pass 
was deflected into the air and 
easily caught by junior safety 
Delano Hill. Malzone’s second 
interception went right into 
the hands of fifth-year senior 
linebacker Desmond Morgan 
over the middle.

“We 

definitely 
had a lot of 
setbacks today, 
but 
we’re 

building,” 
Chesson 
said. 
“We’re 

building 
something 
towards (fall) 
camp, and we 
definitely have 

to pick up things next week 
when we go out there and correct 
the mistakes that we made. We 
executed on some plays and we 
didn’t do well on some plays, so 
we just need to keep working 
hard and keep pushing.”

That effort will continue over 

the summer as the quarterbacks 
compete for playing time in the 
fall. With Morris ahead in the 
race for now, a reporter asked him 
about a postcard featuring the 
line of Michigan quarterbacks 
going back almost a century.

“We have it in our quarterback 

office,” Morris said. “It’s crazy 
to look at that and see the legacy 
of quarterbacks that have been 
at the University of Michigan. 
Having the potential to be a part 
of that, to be talked about as 
those guys, as the Tom Bradys, 
the Denard Robinsons, the Chad 
Hennes, the John Navarres, 
all those guys, it would just be 
unbelievable.”

There’s still a long way to go, 

but Morris took the first step 
Saturday.
