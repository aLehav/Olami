Replacement chosen for
oversight committee
after student resignation
ByJOSEPH LICHTERMAN
Daily Staff Reporter
A replacement student representa-
tive for the Department of Public Safe-
ty Oversight Committee will step in at
the next committee meeting after one
of its two elected student representa-
tives resigned last spring.
LSA senior Deandre Hicks, a mem-
ber of the Defend Affirmative Action
Party, finished third during the March
elections, and according to MSA regu-
lations, will be selected as the replace-
ment for LSA sophomore Ellie Howe
- also a member of DAAP.
The spring elections were the first
for student representatives on the
DPS Oversight Committee - respon-
sible for hearing citizens' grievances
against the Universitys police force
- in over a decade. Previously, rep-
resentatives had been appointed by
the Michigan Student Assembly, but a
Michigan Daily investigation last fall
revealed that the practice was in viola-
tion of state law.
The 1990 Michigan state law that
allowed four-year public universi-
ties to establish campus police forces
required the institutions to create
oversight committees with representa-
tives directly elected by the students,
faculty and staff.
In a student-only vote, Howe and
LSA sophomore Hari Vutukuru of the
Michigan Vision Party were elected as
the student representatives to the com-

Decrease in
endowment payout
rate to be gradually
implemented
By JOSEPH LICHTERMAN
Daily StaffReporter
The University's Board of
Regents voted 5-2 to reduce the
University's endowment payout
rate from 5 percent to 4.5 percent
at their monthly meeting Thursday.

University officials say they
believe that reinvestment of the
extra one-halfpercent will increase
the net worth of the endowment
and result in payouts that are larg-
er, or equal, to current payouts.
In a letter to the regents, Tim
Slottow, the University's execu-
tive vice president and chief finan-
cial officer, said the change in the
endowment payout rate would be
implemented gradually to keep
current payouts at or above current
levels.
"The distribution rate would
be implemented gradually over a
number of years in a flexible man-

ner that would keep the dollar
amount of distributions per share
constant during the implementa-
tion," Slottow wrote.
Regents Julia Darlow (D-Ann
Arbor) and Denise Ilitch (D-Bing-
ham Farms) voted against the pro-
posal.
Before voting, several regents
explained their position on the
measure. Darlow said she thought
decreasing the endowment payout
rate would send the wrong mes-
sage to the public.

spending say they're preserving

UMHS put on
honor roll list

'U' Health System
ranked by U.S. News
and World Report
By KYLE SWANSON
Daily NewsEditor
The U.S. News and World Report
gave the University Health System
top marks in its latest set of rankings
released last week.
The magazine, which ranks the
country's best hospitals each year,
named the University's Hospitals and
Health Systems the 14th best in the
United States. The honor is the sec-
ond year in a row that the University's
Hospital has held the spot and is the
16th year in a row that the organiza-
tion has been on U.S. News and World
Report's honor roll list - which rep-
resents the top 0.3 percent of health
systems able to most capably confront
the most demanding and complex
medical challenges.
In an interview last Thursday, Ora

Pescovitz, the University's executive
vice president for medical affairs,
praised UMHS employees for their
hard work that has allowed the Uni-
versity to maintain its position on the
leader board.
"We're thrilled with the rankings
because they demonstrate continued
excellence and quality of care in all
measures," Pescovitz said. "I think
they affirm the outstanding quality of
our faculty and staff."
Pescovitz added that being among
U.S. News and World Report's top-
ranked hospitals was a great honor
for the University, but was also good
news for the entire state.
"It's a significant achievement,
because there were thousands of hos-
pitals competing to be on that honor
roll," she said. "It's good news for the
citizens of the state of Michigan to
have an asset and a resource of this
caliber in their backyard."
Hospitals that came out in front of
the University in the rankings includ-
ed Johns Hopkins Hospital, the Mayo
Clinic and Cleveland Clinic.

And while University officials may
have their eyes set on improving their
overall ranking in the future, Pescovitz
made it clear that significant challeng-
es lie ahead for the health system due
to the ongoing health care reform.
"Ultimately, with health care
reform in the future, I think what the
challenges of the future will bring
will be to improve safety and quality,
decrease costs and improve access,"
Pescovitz said.
Many of the hospital's specialties
rose to that challenge this year, with
all 16 specialties evaluated receiving
honors from U.S. News and World
Report, including many that moved
up in the rankings from last year.
Doug Strong, the director and CEO
of the University's Hospitals and
Health Centers, said in a statement
released last week that he was happy
with the newly released rankings.
"We are pleased to be nation-
ally recognized in so many areas as a
result of the hard work of our faculty
and staff," Strong said. "It is our wide-
ranging strength in so many special-
ties that keeps us high on the list year
after year."
Among the top ranked specialties of
the University's Hospitals and Health
Systems were Ear, Nose and Throat,
which ranked ninth among the more
than 4,800 hospitals evaluated, and
Urology and Heart and Heart Surger-
ies, both ranking as the 11th best in
the country.

In a U.S. News and World
Report evaluation of more
than 4,800 hospitals across
the country, the University
of Michigan Hospitals and
Health Centers ranked
among the top 25 hospitals
in each of the 16 specialties
evaluated.

professors are designing, building

Withsth tde idea laid out, Shirley
wrote that le hopes the center can

stssdy in the area
'lhe goal of the center is to pen
doors for an isolated community
through education and to provide a
nea ntis for scientific research to
advance it the area," he wrote.
As Shirley pitched his idea to co-
founder and LSA senior Julie Bate-
stan last summer, he wrote that they
both vigilantly sought out funding
for the school. Shirlev added that
they have since received a grant from
the Davis Foundation, fellowships
from the Ginsberg Center and other
funding from the College of Engi-
neering, the College of Architecture,
LSA Honors and private donors.
Shirley also wrote that the con-
struction of the school is being
undertaken by Brazilian locals, GIEU
students and himself to avoid any
further bureaucratic delays.

Sustainability and
conservation to be
focus for students
By CAITLIN HUSTON
Daily Staff Reporter
Inspired by issues of sustainabisity
and education, one University stu-
dent is spending his break transform-
ing the lives of the residents of the
Northern Pantanal region oflirazil.
With construction beginning this
summer, LSA senior Ethan Shirley
is spearheading the creation of the
Pantanal Center for Education and
Research on the Jaguar Ecological
Reserve in lirazil. The center will
feature classes for local children and
adults, as well as a field station where
University researchers and students
will study sustainability and the sur-
rounding environment.

The center also histed a Global
Intercultural Experience for Under-
graduates Programi eld site and
engaging the work of University
engineering students in the Multi-
Disciplinary Design Progras.
In an e-mail interview with the
Michigan Daily, Shirley wrote that he
initially came to the Pantanal region
in 2003 as a tourist and returned sev-
eral times afterward to volunteer at
an ecological resort.
With these visits, Shirley added
that he was struck by the area's need
for a school, as the closest education
center was over 90 miles away in the
town of Pocon6. Another ecologist
had previously tried to start a school
in the region, but Shirley wrote that
the progress was inhibited by the
locals' dislike of the individual.
Shirley also wrote that he felt the
Brazilian government had not initiat-
ed the construction of a school there
due to laziness.

In the e-mail, Shirley wrote that
lie case up with the idea of creating
a school combined with a ield sta-
tion, so that there would not be any'
concerns about the funding of the
project. Under his model, the center
will be funded by the fees research-
ers pay for access to the field station
and other amenities, as well as by the
fees that GIEU students pay to study
there.
At the school, classes will be
offered to children as well as illit-
erate adults, with the curriculum
emphasizing the importance of con-
servation, Sustainability workshops
will also be available for the general
public.
With its focus on sustainability,
the Pantanal Center will also feature
a solar-powered system that will also
be used as a tool for research on the
effectiveness of renewable energy
systens.

'U' receives
grant to study
algal blooms

THE BIGGEST HOUSE

Federal grant funds
will be used to be
improve water quality
of the Great Lakes
By SUZANNE JACOBS
Daily StaffReporter
The University has received
$835,000 from the federal govern-
ment for a project that promises to
improve water quality in the Great
Lakes.
Allen Burton, a professor in the
School of Natural Resources and
Environment, said the money will be
used to better detect harmful bac-
teria and harmful algal blooms, or
HABs, in certain areas of the Great
Lakes.
"(The purpose of the grant is) to
develop and implement techniques,
identified by stakeholders, for pre-
dicting water quality at beaches up to
two days in advance and for forecast-
ing the trajectory and fate of harmful
algal blooms wherever they occur in
the Great Lakes," the grant proposal
said.
Burton, director of the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Admin-
istration's Cooperative Institute
for Limnology and Ecosystems
Research, is one of seven principal
investigators working on the project.
The other six scientists include three
from the NOAA and three from the
University.
The current system in place to
monitor bacterial levels in the Great
Lakes is known as the "persistence
model," which uses one day's mea-
surements of E. coli levels to deter-
mine the next day's water quality.
The principle investigators on the
project claim that this model can
predict inaccurate health conditions
more than 50 percent of the time.
The new model they plan to put in
place with the grant money, they say,
will improve predictions of swim-
ming conditions by at least 20 to 30
percent.
In addition to better predict-
ing bacterial levels in the water, the
project will develop a better method
tn monitor, forecast and under stand


HABs.
According to the Center for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention Health
Studies Program, HABs occur when
algae grow quickly, forming visible
patches in the water. The patches
can block sunlight and deplete the
oxygen that other organisms need to
survive. The HABs also may release
toxins that are dangerous to humans
and other animals.
The current method for detecting
HABs, the principle investigators
argue, is "not sufficient to provide
timely warning about the presence of
HAB ... at a drinking water intake or
recreational beach."
Burton said scientists will be able
to accomplish a lot with the grant
money because it will supplement
research that has already begun.
"The fact that this is taking ongo-
ing projects to the next level ... will
make it easy to accomplish alot in the
next year," Burton said.
Scientists from Michigan State
University, University of South Flor-
ida and the Michigan Sea Grant will
also collaborate on the project.
The money awarded to the Uni-
versity is part of a larger $5.5 mil-
lion federal grant for protecting the
Great Lakes. The largest sum of $3
million is going toward plant and
animal habitats in Saugatuck, while
the Houghton area will get $1.7 mil-
lion for ecology and conservation
research, according to the Associated
Press.

The newly renovated Michigan Stadium opened its doors to the public on Wednesday. The Big House, which can hold 109,901 people,
features a brand new press box, 81 suites and 2,952 outdoor club seats. Go to MichiganDaily.com for the full story on the renovations.

BRAZIL
From Page 2
Melissa Matice, a lecturer in the
English Language Institute and the
GIEU team faculty leader for the
trip, wrote that she and 14 other stu-
dents worked on the school by dig-
ging, doing masonry, mixing cement
and working on whatever else the
site needed.
Through the GIEU program, the
students also gave English lessons
to locals and conducted a census of
the region, so that they can be regis-
tered with the state.
After returning from the program

last week, LSA sophomore Elizabeth
Ludwig said she learned a lot about
the region and the locals' need for
a school through gathering data for
the census.
Ludwig said she talked to many
locals who either would not send
their children to school or who
were forced to pick only one or two
of their children to attend school
in Pocond - many of whom were
unable to see their family for the
majority of the year.
With the opening of the school,
Ludwig said she believes many fami-
lies will be reunited and will be able
to maintain a better family dynamic.

As the construction progresseJ,
Shirley wrote that the center should
be completed by mid-August and the
school will be open to students nkxt
April. But because the school will be
overseen by the state government,
there are still many governmental
hurdles to overcome.
Looking toward the future, Shir-
ley wrote that he is hopeful about
the center's impact on the North-
ern Pantanal community. Once any
problems that might arise at the site
are dealt with, Shirley wrote that he
is considering taking his approach
to other parts of the Pantanal region
and possibly to Madagascar.

Salaries vs. students
Holding down tuition is more important than pay raises
No one was surprised when the University increased tuition again
this year, as it has done for decades. Thanks to a decrease in spend-
ing, though, the hike was relatively small in comparison to past
years. But the University could have increased tuition by an even smaller
rate - or perhaps not at all - if it hadn't committed itself to giving bloated,
sky-high pay raises to its administration. Phil Hanlon, the University's new
provost, followed this trend with a 28 percent pay increase over his prede-
cessor. If the administration wants to get serious on containing spending, it
should look seriously at how much they are costing the University.

Let me tell you a little about my
grandmother. Joyce Gach is one of
the strongest, kindest people I know.
She helps anyone without a moment's
hesitation and always gives all she
has if it means someone she cares
about will benefit. Since I was very
young, she helped take care of me
and was an irreplaceable part of my
childhood. I used to call her "Mom"
because she was with me so often,
and, for this and so many other
things, she has my eternal gratitude
and respect. Truly, my grandma is
my hero.
In May of 1994, my grandma was
diagnosed with breast cancer. I
was too young at the time to under-
stand what this meant or appreci-
ate the struggle she would have to
go through. Thankfully, after sur-
gery and radiation, the disease was
removed from her body. However,
after seven years of having cancer
lurk in the back of her mind, doc-
tors found it again in the fall of 2001.
Again, against the odds, my grandma
beat cancer and has been living can-
cer-free for nine years.
Her story is like so many others,
but many aren't as lucky to have
beaten cancer twice in their life-
time. Approximately 12.6 percent of
women are diagnosed with breast
cancer in their lifetime, and, contrary
to popular belief, men can develop
breast cancer as well. With around
200,000 new cases each year, breast
cancer is second only to lung cancer
in cancer-associated deaths. 40,000
deaths annually are associated with
this cancer and the vast majority of
these victims ace womcn.
Upon diagnossis of bceast cancer,
there are currently many treatments
offered, ensuring that it's not a death
sentence. From surgery to chemo-
therapy to hormonal therapies, there
are many ways that a person can fight
cancer and live a healthy, normal life.
More important than anything, how-
ever, is early discovery of the can-
cer. This early detection is key, and
when breast cancer is discovered in
its earliest stage, 95 percent of people
experience a five-year survival rate.
Every woman, regardless of age,
owes it to herself and those who care
for her to get checked each year for

breast cancer.
This summer, to play my part in
finding the cure for breast cancer, I
walked in the Susan G. Komen Race
for the Cure in Detroit. I walked one
mile alongside 30,000 other like-
minded individuals and survivors in
hope that this disease that destroys
people's lives and entire families is
eradicated. I walked in celebration
of my grandma's many achievements
and in memory of the millions that
have died from this disease. Count-
less teams of pink-clad walkers and
runners filled Woodward Avenue and
showed their dedication to fighting
cancer. Not even the rain could wash
away the jubilant spirits of the crowd
or dampen the hopes each partici-
pant carried.
Imagine your grandmas, your moms
and your sisters. Imagine getting the
call saying that the person you care
most about has been diagnosed with
one of the deadliest diseases of our
time. It's our duty as the future leaders
of the world to do our partin educating
others and fighting cancer.
And there's so much you can do.
The Susan G. Komen Foundation is
dedicated to educating people about
breast cancer and researching a cure.
You can help this cause by donating,
participating in an event like Race for
the Cure or doing personal fundrais-
ing through their Passionately Pink
for the Cure organization. It's our
responsibility to pop our college bub-
ble and see the bigger picture. Find-
ing a cure and fighting for the ones
we love is the noblest thing we can do
- whether we raise thousands of dol-
lars from others sr donate one dollar
ourselves to a foundation, every little
bit counts.
This year I walked a mile. Next
year I plan to run the SK race in
support of the Komen Foundation.
I know the importance of standing
up for what I believe in and fighting
for what I know is right. I hope that
everyone who reads this article will
do their own personal work to fight
breast cancer or support a cause they
feel strongly for. I will walk for sup-
port, race for the cure and fight for
my hero, my grandma.

This January, former Provost
Teresa Sullivan announced her
resignation after she was offered
a position as the president at the
University of Virginia. Philip
Hanlon, formerly the Univer-
sity's vice provost, was hired
to replace Sullivan in Febru-
ary. But the details of his con-
tract, including his salary, have
only recently become available.
According to the terms of Han-
lon's contract, he will receive a
yearly salary of $470,000, a 28
percent increase over Sullivan's
salary of $366,000.
Competitive pay packages
are necessary to draw the best
administrators and faculty mem-
bers to Ann Arbor. And when
their deferred compensation
Sullivan forfeited by leaving the
University is taken into account,
the difference between her total
package and Hanlon's is not. as
great. But the sheer size of his
compensation renders the "com-
petitive pay" argument moot. In

fact, Hanlon will now be making
more than the presidents of the
University of Wisconsin, Univer-
sity of Minnesota, University of
Illinois, Purdue University and
the University of Notre Dame did
in 2009.
The University has a respon-
sibility as a public institution to
its studentsto ensure thathigher
education is financially accessi-
ble. The funding for administra-
tor salaries comes from general
revenues - of which tuition is
a principal component - and
students simply can't afford
to foot the bill for administra-
tors' pay raises. The recession
and decreased state support
mean that students are bearing
a heavier burden, and finan-
cial aid has not increased suf-
ficiently to counter these costs
for everyone. The $104,000
difference between Sullivan's
and Hanlon's salaries could pay
for the University's estimated
full cost of attendance (tuition,

housing, supplies, etc.) for four
in-state freshmen and still have
money left over. The University
has decided that administrator
salaries come before the educa-
tion of four Wolverines.
Hanlon's pay raise is especially
concerning considering the influ-
ence the provost has on the Uni-
versity's yearly budget. One of
Sullivan's greatest strengths was
decreasing spending in an effort
to keep tuition increases low.
Perhaps the most important part
of Hanlon's job will be to follow
Sullivan's lead in cutting costs.
In a disturbing twist of irony, the
man responsible for formulating
aresponsible budget has accepted
an irresponsible pay increase.
The University has a choice:
pad the wallets of its top officials
or make the sacrifices necessary
to keep higher education acces-
sible to everyone. Hanlon's pay
raise paints a disappointing pic-
ture of where the administra-
tion's priorities lie.

We can't legislate wisdom or passion.
We can't legislate competency."
- Sen. Christopher Dodd (D-Conn.) on the passage of financial reform
legislation on Thursday, as reported that day by The New York Times.

Big Ten. Each one
of these changes has been met with
difficulties as well as triumphs. For
a non-athlete, these changes might
not seem extraordinary by any ica-
sure, but they have a huge impact on
an athlete's everyday life.
Head coaching changes are an
enormous transition for any team.
Football and basketball players,
specifically, were affected by Rich
Rodriguez's and John cteilein's
new systems and training icethods.
Luckily for Lis vollcyball players, our
coaches Mark and Leisa Rosen have
beeni re forai ahiile, and we knew
t'e .c.tatilonsliwhen we came in.
hit wrile iUcOwn coaches didn't
change, theN wholc athletic decpart-
cient was affected by a strength and
conditioning overhaul. One day, we
walked into the weight rooi and all
the machines cire gone. Apparent-
ly, the focus had switched to olym-
pic lifting and free weights.
Another change that had a large
impact on the whole athletic depart-
ment was the hiring of Dave Bran-
don as the new athletic director.
The previous director, Bill Martin,
was outstanding. He improved the
department's finances dramatically
and left a physical legacy by reno-
vating and updating facilities. More
than half of the athletic teams on

campus owe their state-of-the-art
arenas to him. With the announce-
ment of his retirement came the
question of his predecessor: what
changes would be made, what the
new focus would be, how it would
affect the department, etc. But so
far David Brandon has been nothing
but a positive force in balancing the
University's tradition with a busi-
nessman's perspective.
The shift from Nike to Adidas
was also a huge change. For fans,
seeing a different symbol on a jer-
sey isn't anything special, but for
athletes it's a big adjustment. Sizes,
fit, comfort, color and durability are
all crucial to being able to play your
sport well. With Nike, every team
had figured out what they liked and
disliked, and they could make small
adjustments in their gear from year
to year. But Adidas specializes in
soccer and football gear, so things
like volleyball shoes and jerseys
presented new challenges.
Nike also copyrighted the color
"Maize," so Adidas actually had to
make a new version of our school
color, now known as "Sun" (which
the volleyball team has affection-
ately dubbed the "highlighter" jer-
seys). While the switch has become
progressively easier throughout the
past iwc "'rs, it's coie with grow-
ing Pains.
'll( most exciting and expensive
change has been the addition of box
seats in the Big House. Michigan
has regained the claim to the largest
stadium in college football, the field
will be 30 percent louder and the
Big House intimidating presence is
now on a whole new scale. Some of
the renovations were structurally
necessary, but some were for added
revenue. This proves, once again,
that the University is always striv-
ing to be bigger and better than the
competition.
Lastly is the newest change: the
addition of the University of Nebras-
ka to the Big Ten. The switch was,

of course, motivated by profit for the
schools and television networks, but
it is the athletes who are ultimately
affected most. Nebraska is not just
another opponent on the schedule -
it's a complete change in ourlives. On
the surface, it creates one more week
of travel. That means more missed
classes, more money spent on travel
and more stress.
The University's
athletic tradition
is evolving.
Another question is how Nebras-
ka will fit in with the Big Ten. Their
athletic department has proven to
be strong, so the level of competi-
tion will be itn par with everyone
else. But it remains to be seen if
their academic standards can mesh
with that of the Big Ten's. So far,
though, it appears our conference
will not be hugely affected by the
addition. At the same time, it's a
huge benefit to Nebraska, and the
Big 12 was'greatly hurt by the css.
Though there are always uncer-
taintics when it comes to change,
all of these new people, projects
and partners seem to be moving
the University Athletic Department
into a new era. There is a strong
respect for the past and the founda-
tion that we were built on, with an
understanding that we must evolve
in order to stay the leaders and
best. The block 'M' will always be
a powerful symbol of the past, but
we must also embrace the changes
now being made in order to help
Wolverie athletics stay on top in
the future.

ENDOWMENT
From Page 1
the endowment for perpetuity,"
Darlow said. "I suspect that for
many people struggling under the
economic conditions prevailing in
this country and state today, per-
petuity sounds like an awfully long
time."
Regent Olivia Maynard (D-
Goodrich) said she believes the lower
distribution rate will help ensure the
long-term stability of the University's
endowment.
"This is a way to maintain, with
minimal net damage, the value of the
University," Maynard said. "Perpetu-
ity is a large word, but on the other
hand, we believe in public higher
education and we want to make sure
it thrives, no matter what the situa-
tion is."
In an interview following the
regents meeting, University Presi-
dent Mary Sue Coleman said she
appreciated the debate the regents
had over changing the payout.
"Obviously I was very much in
favor of it because my administra-
tion made the recommendation, but
I understand that people have legiti-
mate differences," Coleman said. "I
have faith that our folks will be very
careful; they want to make sure that

nobody gets less money from one
year to the next. I felt like it was the
prudent thingto do and I appreciated
the discussion."
Currently, the total endowment
value is determined using a sev-
en-year rolling average, which is
recalculated at the end of each fis-
cal quarter. The spending policy
replaced a three-year rolling average
in 2006 to help stabilize payouts in
volatile markets.
REGENTS APPROVE CON-
STRUCTION SCHEMATICS
The regents also unanimously
approved designs for the renovations
of Crisler Arena, the new golf prac-
tice facility and the addition to the
Institute of Social Research build-
ing.
The $20 million renovations to
Crisler Arena will make the building
compliant with the American with
Disabilities Act by increasing the
number of handicapped accessible
seating, replacing the seats in the
lower bowl and widening the aisles
in the lower bowl.
The renovations will also improve
the arena's emergency systems with
new fire detection and suppression
systems, smoke evacuation system
and emergency lighting.
A proposed schematic design for

the Athletic Department's new golf
practice facility, to be located on
South Main Street near the Univer-
sity Golf Course, was also approved
at the meeting. The new facility will
allow the men's and women's golf
teams to train year-round with
indoor driving bays, putting greens
and chipping areas. Additionally,
the facility will include office space,
meeting rooms and locker rooms.
Women's golf coach Cheryl Stacy
said in a statement that the $2.5 mil-
lion facility will enhance the com-
petitiveness of the University's golf
program.
"This facility will enhance our
program's ability to practice dur-
ing the winter months, providing an
environment for our players to con-
tinually work on their technique,"
Stacy said.
Regents also approved a design
proposal for the ISR addition, which
will consist of a four level, 44,700
gross square foot addition to the cur-
rent ISR building and renovations of
7,200 gross square feet of the current
building.
The $23 million project will cre-
ate new office, research and meeting
spaces as well as state-of-the-art bio-
specimen and data storage.

mittee, which is also comprised of
faculty and staff representatives.
Hicks, who removed himself from
the race before the votes were cast,
remained on the ballot.
Hicks did not respond to interview
requests, but in an interview with The
Michigan Daily last March, he said he
withdrew from the race because of a
"hectic schedule," which was com-
prised of classes and a 40-hour-per-
week internship with United States
Rep. John Dingell (D-Ann Arbor).
Hicks' name remained on the bal-
lot as a result of miscommunication
between MSA election officials and
the candidate, officials told the Daily
last spring.
Despite his withdrawal from the
contest, Hicks told the Daily last
March thatifelected hewould accept
the seat on the committee. However,
he also said he wasn't fully knowl-
edgeable on what his responsibilities
as a representative would be, or what
the function of the committee was.
"As far of the details, I'm not quite
sure," he said at the time.
In an e-mail interview, MSA Presi-
dent Chris Armstrongsaid Hicks will
start work on the committee as soon
as possible.

"Deandre is away for the summer,
but as soon as he returns, he will be
attending the next DPS Oversight
Committee meeting to officially
replace Ellie," Armstrong wrote in
the e-mail.
In an e-mail interview with the
Daily, Howe wrote that her resigna-
tion was a result of other conflicting
priorities.
"I was taking summer classes,
working, and trying to plan an afford-
able trip to Europe," Howe wrote. "It
was a very overwhelming and stress-
ful time and I felt in over my head.
"It would have been possible to
stay on, and sometimes I wish I had,
but I realized that when your family
needs you, there are some things you
have to give up," Howe added. "So I
made the difficult decision to leave,
and the committee was very under-
standing."

Equipped with handheld GPS devic- targeted certain ethnic, subcultural

or language groups led by people from
that community. The advertising was
disproportionately local this time, as
opposed to national."
For example, Groves said that to
reinforce the importance of counting
each and every person in the house-
hold, the Los Angeles Regional Office
distributed onesies for babies that said,
"I'm here. I should be counted."
Advertisements for the 2010 Census
appeared in a wide variety of languag-
es in an attempt to make more people
aware of the process and the dead-
lines to decrease the number of non-
responses.
Another way that the Census Bureau
attempted to reduce the number of
non-responses was by mailing out
replacement forms.
"Survey researchers have known
for maybe 40 years that if you send
a replacement form, that raises the
response rate. The 2010 Census for the
first time has that feature," Groves said.
Based on preliminary results, Groves
said he has noticed the positive effect of
the replacement forms in the response
rates. He also noted something inter-
esting about the response rates.
"A surprise to meas a social scientist,
was thatifyoubuild apredictive model,
you can drive the race and ethnicity
coefficient almost to zero if you put in
socioeconomic indicators," Groves
said. "This is a much bigger correlate

than race and ethnicity. I'm not sure
we have addressed that as a country as
much as we've addressed the variation
in race and ethnicity."
But there is always some data that
will simply not be returned to the
bureau. Groves said one of his favorite
stories from the 2010 Census collection
came from the Detroit Regional Office.
Groves said an employee working
for census collection ventured to the
Upper Peninsula to deliver a question-
naire to an isolated cabin. After hik-
ing for more than a mile, the employee
came upon the cabin to find the 2000
Census, still attached to the doorknob.
"You cannot be cost efficient in a
census," Groves laughed about the
story.
Despite the efforts of the Census
Bureau so far, Groves said the numbers
collected at this point are still only pre-
liminary.
"The revisions of these numbers will
continue throughout the fall. I believe
strongly that one building block of
the credibility of census is for us to be
transparent. You are going to see all
these numbers," he said.
The deadline for the 2010 Census is
December 31. By this date the Census
Bureau must submit the population
counts on a state level to the President
so that the number of seats inthe House
of Representatives to be reapportioned
accordingly.

Old, new at A2 fair

New innovations don't
compromise spirit of
Ann Arbor Art Fairs
By EMMA JESZKE
ManagingArts Editor
Anyone who has ever been in Ann
Arbor over the summer knows what
kind of madness
ensues during the Ann Arbor
Art Fairs: The mas- Art Fairs
sive flock to all areas
of campus and down- Wednesday
town leaves little through
room for anything Saturday
but the art that the Various locations
city comes together around campus
to celebrate. and downtown
Each year, four Free
independent fairs
- the Ann Arbor Street Art Fair, The
Original; the State Street Area Art Fair;
the Ann Arbor Summer Art Fair and
Ann Arbor's South University Art Fair
- act as one,bringinginroughlyathou-
sand artists and over half a million visi-
tors from all over the world.
The high-traffic, low-parking occa-
sion probably seems like a reason for
University students to piss and moan.
But participating artists explain why
the Art Fairs provide an opportu-
nity for all demographics to become
involved with the local art scene.
Samuel Yao, a professional basket
weaver and Art Fair veteran, com-
mented on the fairs' importance as an

Ann Arbor staple, recognized across
the nation.
"During the year, I travel to many
places ... almost anywhere Igo, the peo-
ple know Ann Arbor," Yao said. "Ann
Arbor is very famous for two things:
One is the University, of course, and the
other one is the Ann Arbor Art Fair."
Yao expressed that the eclecticism
and variety provided by theAnn Arbor
Art Fairs comes from a continuous
cycle of not only patrons of the fairs,
but from the new work being displayed
from up-and-coming artists.
"Because the Art Fair has been run-
ning for so many years, I see over the
years some old artists retiring and also
young artists coming in for the shows,"
Yao said. "This is a very good thing for
the Art Fair to continue - when some
artists retire, new artists keeping add-
ingin."
Yao also commented on how the Art
Fairs are not only good for celebrating
the culture and work of the artists, but
also for stimulating the local economy
by bringing a high influx of out-of-
towners into the city and, in turn, a lot
of business for local shops and restau-
rants.
While most aspects that avid fair-
goers know and love will remain
intact, some innovations have been
introduced to this year's Art Fairs.
Brought up-to-date with the latest
technology, they will create as low-
stress an experience as possible for
those who may be averse to the chaos
of the fairs.

Innovations at this year's fairs
include a free Ann Arbor Art Fairs
iPhone App - people can download
it via iTunes directly to their iPhone.
The app gives access to an artist search
thatincludes participants' information
and a sample of their work, an enter-
tainment search by name/stage/genre
and convenient ways to getto and from
the Art Fairs as well as parking, a local
business search and more.
Also new this year will be air-con-
ditioned trolleys which run on natural
gas - at a cost of $1 per day, fairgo-
ers will be able to be shipped easily
between the separate fairs.
There are also new park-and-ride
options available for fairgoers, with a
new location at Maple Village Shop-
ping Center for a $4 round trip. Other
shuttles are available at Briarwood
Mall, Pioneer High School and with
the University Commuter Bus from
North Campus - all for about a $3
round trip.
Although these changes have been
made to help the Art Fairs run as
smoothly as possible for visitors, the
integrity of the fairs remains the same.
Each of the fairs holds its own person-
ality, and each has a unique draw that
distinguishes it from the other loca-
tions. The fairs will be hosting a wide
array of artists - some local to the
A2 scene, like Yao, and some from all
corners of the globe; some artists who
have been coming to the fairs for 30
years, and others just on the brink of
their professional careers.

The stuff dreams are made of

lnception' plants kicks and thrust their subjects head-
first toward the real world.
ideas of greatness But a kick is something else too,

By ANDREW LAPIN
Editor in Chief
There's a common term employed in
the world of dream thieves headed by
Leonardo DiCaprio's
Dom Cobb, and it's
an important one. It's
called a "kick," and it inception
refers to an act of pro-
pulsion that produces At Quality6
an adrenaline rush so and Rave
intense it wakes you Warner Bros.
from your dreamland.
Submerging a head underwater, driv-
ing a car off a bridge, creating a giant
explosion in a zero-gravity elevator
shaft - these are all acts that produce

something less tangible. When you
kick, you're taking a plunge.You're jolt-
ed away from what you had previously
believed your reality was. The earth
turns on its side. The walls crumble
around you. And if this happens to you
when you're watching a movie, well,
maybe that movie just kicked your ass.
"Inception" is a feature-length kick.
It's a heist movie that hops across
dreamscapes instead of across the
globe. It pulls rug after rug after rug
out from under the audience and justly
earns every pull. Here is a movie so
smart and all-knowing that its writer-
director, Christopher Nolan, was able
to plant the ideaof itsgreatness into the
mind of its audience even before anyone
saw it. Who told us to love this movie so

much? Maybe our dreams did.
Nolan, of course, is known for
making movies that mess with his
characters, whether they're forget-
ful detectives ("Memento"), tortured
superheroes ("The Dark Knight") or
obsessive magicians ("The Prestige").
And he also knows how to mess with
his audience in a hyper-contextual-
ized, pay-attention-every-second-or-
you'll-regret-it kind of way. This is the
brand of filmmaking wizardry that's
on display in "Inception," partnered
with ingeniously contrived action
sequences that push the limits of the
mind. It's like if James Bond were sent
to Shutter Island and got trapped in Dr.
Parnassus's Imaginarium.
Figuring out how "Inception" works
is half the fun, so it does no good
to relay a plot description or offer a
detailed explanation of the worlds of
the dreams. After all, when the good
guys have to enter a target's mind, the
experienced ones know they have to
enter the dream cold; any knowledge
of the environment could become
intertwined with their own subcon-
scious and jeopardize the mission.
Similarly, any background info on
the content of the film could cloud
viewers' interpretations and prevent
maximum enjoyment. Which means
you shouldn't know what a totem is, or
why the film doesn't employ the device
to its full potential. And you shouldn't
know how the rules of the dreamland
affect what it means to "die," or why
being sent to Limbo strikes more fear

Saturday was even better: Titus
Andronicus put on an awe-inspiring
performance, towingthe line between
the hardcore punk of Husker Dil and
the anthemic orchestrations of the
Boss in his prime with tracks from
this year's brilliant Civil War concept
album, The Monitor. Wolf Parade was
equally impressive, proving that indie
bands can rock just as hard nowadays
as ever (Beach House aside).
LCD Soundsystem's performance
turned Union Park into a packed-in

So what can be known about "Incep-
tion" going in? Well, for starters, the
ensemble cast is tremendous. Youthful
Ellen Page ("Juno") and Joseph Gor-
don-Levitt ("(500) Days of Summer")
more than hold their own against
the seasoned vets. Nolan gets great
leverage out of his usual company of
actors, from Ken Watanabe as a shady
businessman to Cillian Murphy as
the unwitting star of his own dream
(both previously featured in "Batman
Begins"). And Marion Cotillard ("Pub-
lic Enemies") gives the movie's best
performance in her many incarna-
tions, but the particulars of who she is
and why she keeps appearing are best
left unanswered.
electro-punkers Can and Suicide on
the rambling track "Losing My Edge."
Always ironic and hyper-aware,
Murphy even commented on the fes-
tival itself, complimenting the event
staffers for their down-to-earth
treatment of the audience (dousing
the front rows with ice and water
mid-performance, lowering the price
of water to $1 during the peak of
the 95-degree afternoons and hav-
ing plenty of restroom facilities and
recycling bins). The peak of the night
was the band's stirring performance
of Sound of Silver's late-night ode to
broken relationships and ennui "All
My Friends." With glowsticks, beach
balls and paper ribbons in the air, the
entire crowd sang, "Where are your
friends tonight?" with heart-choking
fervor.
Sound problems plagued only a
small handful of bands through the
first two days. Real Estate's lead
vocals were cut for an entire song,
and a nasty ring of feedback and
noise plagued the first half of Broken

There's also the sheer audacity of this
filmmaking endeavor tobe considered:
Nolan shot "Inception" in six different
countries, even though the majority of
the movie is set within non-location-
specific dreams. And those zero-grav-
ity action scenes ... holy moly, do they
look great (if a bit "Matrix"-inspired).
Will "Inception" contain as many
satisfying secrets in its repeatviewings
as "The Prestige?" Probably not. Will
some call it out for similarities to that
other 2010 release starring a mentally
unstable DiCaprio? Perhaps. Should
this stop anyone on the planet from
seeing the movie as soon as possible?
Absolutely not. This nonstop adrena-
line rush to the psyche willblow minds
with every passing second. The movie
is a living thing. It kicks.

shaky starts, each band settled into
its groove once the knob-turners off-

Rare gaffes aside, festival organiz-
ers know that the music at Pitchfork
reigns above all else, and they took
great lengths to ensure top-notch
sound quality and earsplittingvolume
when appropriate. (Hint: It's always
appropriate).
And while I was holding out for
a picturesque sunset to Pavement's
"Gold Soundz" with the Sears Tower*

(almost) just as exciting. Though it's

Season Preview

Blue D-backs may struggle to return to glory

By RYAN KARTJE
ManagingEditor
When analyzing Michigan's
defense during the RichRod era, one
glaring weakness has become obvious,
year after year:
Ninth in Big Ten pass defense in
2008.
Seventh in the same category last
season.
See a pattern? Adding more insult
to injury, the year before Rich Rodri-
guez took over as head football coach,
the Wolverines' pass defense ranked
near tops in the Big Ten, allowing just
178.8 yards per game in Lloyd Carr's
last season at the helm.
One could point to the improve-
ment (albeit slight) in Michigan's pass
defense from the 2008 season to the
2009 season. That sort of improve-
ment should continue, right?
Well, with a pass rush that remains
a huge question mark and a second-
ary devoid of the shutdown skills of
All-Big Ten talent Donovan Warren
- who signed with the New York Jets
after going undrafted - the Wolver-
ines could be hard-pressed to improve
on their meager numbers in the defen-
sive backfield.
With Warren gone, the pressure
will be on senior corner Troy Wool-
folk to fill the shoes of Michigan's
shutdown corner. After splitting time
between corner and safety last year,
Woolfolk should be prepared to be
Warren-esque in his performance.
And although he lacks the impressive
size that made Warren the dominant
force he was, Woolfolk makes up for
it with blazing speed, enough to be
referred to by some as the fastest play-
er on the team..
But aside from Woolfolk, the rest of
the position group gets pretty fuzzy
* from there. The other cornerback
spot, which many thought could be
filled by blue-chip prospect Demar
Dorsey before he was denied admis-
sion to the University, remains a wide
open competition.
The most likely candidate for the
job is J.T. Floyd, a redshirt sophomore
who was a regular in nickel and dime
packages last season. With a few years
of experience in the defense (even
though it's been consistently changing
since he enrolled), he should have the

advantage to nab that second spot - at
least to start the season. In his time
in the spotlight, however, Floyd was a
little better than average, appearing to
be in over his head at times.
But don't count out freshman Cul-
len Christian. Christian was one of
the Wolverines' star recruits in their
past recruiting class and his size
makes him an ideal replacement for
Warren. Just like Warren, however,
Christian has been criticized for lack-
ing top-end speed, which kept him
from five-star status on all the major
recruiting sites.
Floyd will still get the nod against
UConn, but don't be surprised if you
see Christian take that spot for his
own by the fifth or sixth game, with
Floyd sliding back to the nickel or
dime spot. And maybe, just maybe,
sometime this season Wolverine fans
will get a glimpse of super prospect
J.T. Turner. As for the safety spots, the
goal of improving those pass defense

numbers doesn't get much easier.
Jordan Kovacs will most likely
retain his spot at the bandit safety
position, where he'll play up close and
aid with the run-defense in addition to
droppingback into coverage. And with
the lack of viable options behind him,
it's not likely that Kovacs will lose his
job. But if anyone were to challenge
him, it'll be incoming freshman Mar-
vin Robinson who has wowed coaches
to this point with his brute strength
and athleticism.
But aside from the glaring question
marks, there is one unique and seem-
ingly positive experiment going on in
the Wolverines' back four.
Cam Gordon, a wide receiver when
he came to Michigan, has made head-
lines this spring and summer for his
seamless conversion to the Wolver-
ines' free safety spot, where it looks
like he'll start come Sept. 4.
Despite his lauded transformation,
it still should worry Michigan fans, at

Senior cornerback Troy Woolfolk is Donovan Warren's potential replacerent this year.

least a little bit, that Gordon has never
played a down on defense. If he turns
out as dominant as the coaches say he
will be, then he'll be one of the most
pleasant surprises of Michigan's sea-
son.

Blais enjoys challenge as'M'netminder

By CASANDRA PAGNI
Daily Sports Writer
Growing up 2,300 miles away in
Seattle, Washington, redshirt junior
Chris Blais never dreamed he would
be the starting goalkeeper at Michi-
gan.
And since Blais's parents and
grandparents were Notre Dame grad-
uates and avid fans of the Fighting
Irish, the fact that Blais now proudly
dons a Michigan jersey is even more
incomprehensible.
But Michigan and Blais were a per-
fect match - so much so that Blais
now laughs when he recalls his days of
rooting for the Fighting Irish.
"Obviously growing up, I was a
little bit of a 'Golden Domer', as they
say," Blais said. "But once I got into
recruiting, I took my visit to Michigan
and (saw a) game at the Big House. I'm
pretty much a sports junkie, so see-
ing all the big time sports Michigan
has was a big thing for me. That was
the combination for me - a big school
with sports that obviously has very
good academics."
The goalkeeper is heading into
his second season as the Wolverines'
starter, and the expectations for Blais
are higher than ever.
A full time goalie since he was 10
years old, Blais has come to enjoy the
high-stakes environment that a colle-
giate-level keeper competes in.
"I don't feel pressure but I always
feel anxiety to play the game," Blais
said. "Four or five hours before we
play, I'm already anxious for the game
... Once the game starts, once the
whistle is blown, that's when every-
thing changes for me and I'm just
ready to go."
A FORCE IN THE NET
While Blais's position is a respon-

sibility that senior defender Chase
Tennant called "tough from the start,"
Blais thrives on the intensity of the
position he plays.
"As a kid I played basketball, base-
ball and soccer, and in some ways
(being) goalie involved all three of
them," Blais said. "Being the only
player who is able to use their hands
and catching skills, it brought me to
really like the position."
The keeper decided to redshirt his
freshman season in 2007, as former
Wolverine Patrick Sperry was the
starting goalie that year. Blais had to
wait two seasons before the starting
job became his, but now understands
how valuable his seasons on the bench
truly were.
"In my life, I never had to be the
second guy (before my redshirt sea-
son)," Blais said. "Whether it was club
soccer or high school, I was always
the one playing. I learned a lot about
myself especially that no matter who
you were before you came to college,
you can always work harder."
Following his redshirt season, Blais
played three games for the Wolverines
in 2008 with one start, which he won.
With two years of little to no game-
time action, Blais tried to soak up as
much of the veteran team's knowledge
as he could, knowing that his turn to
start for Michigan was just around the
corner.
"When I wasn't the full time start-
er, I didn't have that anxiety (for the
game) as much," Blais said. "You know
as a backup goalie you might have a
chance to get in the game, and you try
and warm up in practice every day like
you're maybe going to play, but with a
long season that is kind of hard.
"But when I knew I was the starter,
I took every rep in practice so seri-
ously and the preparation for the game
was so serious. That was the biggest

Blais was named to the CoSIDA/ hometown for the second summer in

a row.
"(Blais) has a year under his belt
which gives him all the confidence
in the world," senior forward Jus-
tin Meram said. "He had a good year
already and it was like his rookie year
in a sense ... I think he's going to come
in with the right mindset after train-
ing in Seattle."
THE FUTURE LOOKS BRIGHT
With Michigan's season set to kick-
off August 21 against West Virginia,
Blais is making sure the rest of the
team remains focused on their sum-
mer preparations.
Meram calls Blais a jokester until
game time, but then "(Blais) is all busi-
ness."
"He sets up meetings during the
offseason to get everybody together
and to see where everybody's at,"
Meram said. "He wants to win like all
of us, but he takes control of it and puts
it in a positive way in that we all feel
comfortable with it."
With an experienced team set to
take the field for Michigan this fall,
the Wolverines know how vital Blais's
season is to their overall team success.
The senior class and those with
prior time on the team know how
"quick it goes"- a phrase Meram used
to describe the brevity of the college
soccer season. But with Blais settled
into back of the net, Michigan can
rest assured that their goalkeeper has 0
one goal in mind - a trip to the NCAA
Tournament for the senior class.
"Everyone knows (Blais') capa-
bilities and what kind of player he
is," Tennant said. "Knowing that and
knowing that we are comfortable and
confident with his abilities, it raises
the confidence of everyone else."
