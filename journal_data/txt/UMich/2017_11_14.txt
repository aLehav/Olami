On Tuesday, University of 

Michigan 
Central 
Student 

Government will vote on its 
divestment resolution. Tensions 
have been ramping up, as it has 
in mid-Novembers over the 
past decade. The resolution 
aims to gain support from CSG 
on divestment from companies 
operating 
in 
Israel 
due 
to 

possible human rights violations 
of Palestinians.

 
This 
year’s 
iteration 
of 

the resolution has not been 
without conflict. Last week, 
an 
investigative 
committee 

within CSG was convened to 
review “improper use of CSG 
materials” by a member of the 
executive team stating CSG did 
not support the #UMDivest 
movement.

 According to the ethics 

committee’s 
reports, 
the 

undisclosed member of CSG’s 
executive committee sent an 
email to a recipient outlining 
CSG’s 
supposed 
opposal 
to 

the movement. According to 
allegations, the member then 
had a conversation with another 
student stating CSG’s opposition 
to divestment. A Facebook post 
also discussed anti-divestment 
sentiment in the body, this time 
in relation to the assembly’s 
diversity. 
The 
post 
claimed 

the 
individual 
stated 
there 

are “not enough white men” 

and “Jewish people” on the 
assembly; however, a self-survey 
distributed within CSG last year 
found a member of the body 
was most likely to be a wealthy, 
white heterosexual male. 

 History of the resolution
Students Allied for Freedom 

and Equality — a group of 
“student activists organized to 
promote social justice, human 
rights, 
liberation, 
equality, 

and self-determination for the 
Palestinian people” — brought 
the resolution in its current form 

in 2014, in what remains the 
high-water mark for the campus 
movement. After first reads 
in mid-March, the assembly 
voted to indefinitely postpone 
a decision on the resolution. 
AFE members and allies held a 
weeklong sit-in in CSG’s Union 
chambers to force a vote — but 
the resolution ended up failing 
in a secret ballot vote 25-9. 

 SAFE’s arguments center 

around alleged human rights 
violations 
by 
companies 

supporting 
Israeli 
military 

activities and operations. This 
year’s resolution names Boeing, 
Hewlett Packard and United 
Technologies as “companies that 
supply weapons and equipment 
to Israel’s illegal occupation 
of Palestinian territories in 
violation of international human 
rights law” through actions 
such as checkpoints and civilian 
casualties. 

 Divestment is rare. Since 

1817, the University has divested 
just twice — first in 1978 from 
apartheid 
in 
South 
Africa 

and later in 2000 from the 
tobacco industry. Yet before 
any resolution even reached the 
floor of any student government 
on 
any 
of 
the 
University’s 

campuses, 
former 
University 

president Mary Sue Coleman 
expressed in 2002 the University 
would not be divesting from 
Israel. In a 2005 statement 
describing 
the 
University’s 

investment 
portfolio, 
then-

Chief 
Financial 
Officer 

Timothy 
Slottow 
remarked 

the 
University’s 
endowment 

is profit-driven, veering away 
from 
political 
persuasions. 

SAFE draws upon the precedent 
of South Africa, tobacco in its 
resolutions, 
arguing 
human 

rights violations are antithetical 
to the University’s commitment 
to “invest in socially responsible 
companies.” 

 Institutions like Columbia 

and 
Harvard 
had 
already 

established endowment ethical 
advisory review committees. In 
the last decade, Northwestern 

University, the University of 
Wisconsin 
at 
Madison, 
the 

University of Minnesota and 
the University of California-
Berkeley have passed resolutions 
calling for divestment. Student 
governing bodies at the Ohio 
State 
University, 
meanwhile, 

spoke out against divestment 
where the resolutions failed to 
pass.

 
On 
this 
campus, 
the 

resolution’s 
proponents 
and 

critics seem to reach an annual 
impasse on core issues such as 
identity, inclusion and the role 
of dialogue. Students on both 
sides wonder if this year will be 
any different. 

 The divide between sides
Historically, the divestment 

movement 
has 
been 

characterized as divisive; critics 
argue SAFE seeks to break 
apart the student body rather 
than bring it together. In an 
interview with The Daily, two 
SAFE members — who wish 
to remain anonymous due to 
targeting 
of 
pro-Palestinian 

activists online — decried the 
“divisive” argument as one used 
to quell Palestinians’ concerns. 

 
“This 
argument 
has 

historically 
been 
used 

silence 
marginalized 
voices, 

historically in the country and 
not just on campuses,” one of 
the 
students 
said. 
“Voicing 

someone’s concerns about literal 
human rights violations should 
not be a divisive point.”

 During last year’s resolution, 

one SAFE member asked, “How 
is 
helping 
Palestinians 
on 

your campus hurting Jewish 
students?”

 
Earlier 
this 
month, 

SAFE released a “Statement 
of 
Solidarity 
to 
Support 

Divestment” 
in 
2017. 
More 

than 30 student organizations 
— many of which are social 
justice-oriented — signed the 
statement, including the Black 
Student Union, Jewish Voice 
for Peace, the executive board 
of 
United 
Asian 
American 

The 
Senate 
Advisory 

Committee on University Affairs 
convened 
Monday 
afternoon 

to 
discuss 
amending 
the 

Statement of Student Rights and 
Responsibilities — a University 
of Michigan document written 
by and for students that outlines 
University standards and norms 
of behavior — making tuition 
more affordable for students and 
increasing the faculty’s role in 
diversity, equity and inclusion. 

LSA senior Anushka Sarkar, 

Central 
Student 
Government 

president, served as a guest 
speaker and discussed amending 
the statement to include biased 
motivated 
misconduct 
as 
a 

violation of University behavior. 
The section regarding bullying 
and harassment violations does 
not explicitly state that biased 
and prejudice motivation against 
another 
student 
results 
in 

heightened sanctions, according 
to Sarkar.

“Under the statement, there’s 

no codification that says that if 
a student stalks another person 
or hazes another person and it’s 
bias-motivated — you hazed a 
person because they were Black, 
you hazed a person because they 
were gay — that you would receive 
heightened sanctions for that,” 
Sarkar said. “Myself and a lot of 
students find that to be wrong and 
that is something that should be 
codified in documents.”

Sarkar proposed amending the 

document to add “Violation V,” 
which clarifies bias-motivated 
misconduct language.

“Bias-motivated 
misconduct 

is a violation of community 
behaviors, 
including 
but 
not 

limited to characteristics such as 
race, gender, sexual orientation, 
gender expression,” Sarkar said.

Sarkar 
also 
announced 
a 

second amendment that will 
outline the measures that will be 
taken if a student is in violation of 

bias-motivated misconduct.

“Should a student be found 

of having committed an act 
against another person with 
bias or prejudice motivation that 
their sanctions be heightened 
automatically,” she said.

The 
purpose 
of 
these 

amendments is to deter students 
from committing bias-motivated 
acts, as they will know there 
will be heightened sanctions as a 
consequence. The level to which 

sanctions will be heightened will 
be treated on a case-by-case basis 
up to the discretion of the Office of 
Student Conflict Resolution, and 
each of these cases will result in 
two separate charges, according 
to Sarkar.

“The goal here is to set the 

precedence in our governing 
documents that action that is 
taken against another person in 
a malevolent way with biased or

the Adult and Higher Education

Monday 
afternoon, 
Central 

Student Government announced 
it will continue a program from 
the previous administration to 
encourage students to participate 
in Bystander Intervention training.

This initiative, a program CSG 

piloted under past-President David 
Schafer last year, will require any 
student 
organization 
wishing 

to claim more than $1,000 a 
semester in funding from the CSG 
Student 
Organization 
Funding 

Commission to have at least two of 
their authorized signers complete 
a Bystander Intervention course. 
The trainings, facilitated by Sexual 
Assault Prevention and Awareness 
Center’s Bystander Intervention 
and 
Community 
Engagement 

program and Wolverine Wellness, 
aim to bring issues of sexual abuse, 
as well as drug and alcohol abuse, 
into the open. They are focused 
on empowering people who might 
witness incidences of misconduct 
to intervene and change campus 
culture surrounding these issues.

Tragedy struck this weekend 

at A2 STEAM, a K-8 Ann Arbor 
public magnet school program 
housed in Northside Elementary 
School, when a fire Saturday 
night killed several chickens 
being raised by A2 STEAM 
students.

The fire department was 

called about 9:20 p.m. with a 
report of flames on the side 
of the school. According to 
Derek Wiseley, Ann Arbor Fire 
Battalion chief, when firefighters 
arrived on the scene, they found 
the adjacent chicken coop to be 
on fire.

The fire was put out within 

20 minutes of the call, but the 
firefighters were unable to save 
four of the coop’s five chickens. 
The surviving chicken is being 
cared for at a local animal 
hospital and is expected to 
survive.

The incident has taken a 

toll on A2 STEAM students and 
families, Wiseley told MLive. 
Parents and teachers came to the 

school Saturday night to offer 
help and assess the damage.

“It’s a big deal for these kids 

and the parents and everybody,” 
Wiseley said. “There were some 
parents on the scene that were 

clearly upset.”

YOUTH SYMPHONY

ON THE DAILY: NO MORE CHICKENS CROSSING THE ROAD

Rep. 
John 
Sarbanes, 

D-Md., attended a roundtable 
discussion 
with 
University 

of 
Michigan 
students 
in 

the School of Public Policy 
Monday, discussing the issues 
of 
“big-money” 
politics, 

gerrymandering 
and 
the 

hyperpolarized 
partisanship 

that he says has developed in 
Congress.

Sarbanes 
started 
by 

explaining a unique solution 
to eliminate big donors from 
controlling 
a 
politician’s 

campaign 
funding. 
He 

proposed 
small-donor 

matching 
for 
campaign 

funding, with an accompanied 
federal tax credit.

Sarbanes claimed this would 

enable voters to “reclaim their 
democracy.”

“The average citizen feels 

like their voice is not being 
heard,” Sarbanes said, “Young 
people have an important role 
to play in figuring out new 
approaches to our politics that 
can be more empowering.”

Public 
Policy 
professor 

Richard 
Hall 
moderated 

the 
discussion. 
He 
said 

he 
appreciated 
Sarbanes’s 

position 
on 
money 
and 

campaigning.

 “(Sarbanes) is the leader in 

the house on campaign finance 
reform … (which) hasn’t gained 
much traction in a very long 
time,” 
he 
said, 
explaining 

the importance of smaller 
donations.

When 
discussing 

gerrymandering, Sarbanes said 

he supports the Redistricting 
Reform Act of 2017, which 
would authorize nonpartisan 
groups to redraw the districts’ 
lines to eliminate politicized 
districts.

This 
is 
a 
significant 

conversation 
in 
Maryland, 

especially 
in 
Sarbanes’s 

district, where large cities 
and communities are greatly 
divided among districts, he 

explained.

He 
said 
computers 

now dictate district lines, 
where 
they 
construct 

districts with “precincts 
not 
communities,” 

as 
top 
priority. 

Gerrymandering 
in 

Michigan is also largely 
debated.

Public Policy junior 

Jeryne 
Fish, 
whose 

home is in Sarbanes’s 
district, said she’s glad 
Sarbanes 
addressed 

topics important to her, 
such as the cynicism 
between politician and 
constituent.

“I think it is rare that 

everyday 
citizens, 
let 

alone one’s our age, can 
sit down and talk to him 
to ask these questions,” 
she 
said. 
“(Sarbanes) 

talking to our generation 
is a step in the right 
direction because all too 
many times politicians 
say that they don’t have 
the time.”

prejudice motivation will not be 
tolerated and will be sanctioned,” 
Sarkar said. “Not only will you 
be sanctioned for the act you 
committed, but you will also be 
sanctioned for the motivation that 
you had to commit the act.”

E. 
Royster 
Harper, 
vice 

president for student life, discussed 
the degree to which OSCR is 
engaged in the process of these 
incidents.

“(Students) believe the only 

recourse is the criminal recourse,” 
Harper stated. “Sometimes it’s not 
a crime in the criminal kind, it is 
a violation of our own values and 
standards.”

Martin Philbert, provost and 

executive 
vice 
president 
for 

academic affairs, served as a 
second guest speaker and reported 
University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel believes the University 
should not tax the income of 
graduate students.

“These are people who have 

already engaged in undergraduate 
education 
and 
are 
going 
to 

contribute to society in a deeper 
and 
sometimes 
broader 
level 

through the acquisition of even 
higher education, and adding a 
financial tax on that commitment 
to deeper engagement to society 
just seems unwise,” Philbert said. 

“It puts them in financial jeopardy 
and deepens the divide between 
those who can afford and those 
who we would like to bring in but 
can’t necessarily afford.”

Though the University would 

like to reach this goal, the reality 
of budgeting interferes with any 
chance of it. According to Philbert, 
current budget proposals, being 
in the tens of millions of dollars 
with some reaching $20 million, 
create a challenging obstacle for 
administrators.

However, based on this financial 

need among students, Philbert is 
hopeful to make tuition as low as 
possible.

“There is a clear sense among 

staff and the student body that 
along with making a healthy living, 
there is a healthy need to make 
the world a better place, but that 
frequently comes at the cost of 
making a healthier financial living, 
so I think we need to provide as 
affordable education as we possibly 
can,” Philbert said.

Philbert also discussed the 

faculty’s role in diversity, equity 
and inclusion and how to create 
a more open campus climate that 
welcomes dialogue.

“The nearest I have come to it is: 

Are we welcoming of everyone?” 
Philbert 
asked. 
“Within 
that 

welcome we are mindful of the fact 
that people come from different 
places, different experiences, and 
they are all here, so that for faculty, 

students and staff this is a place of 
learning.”

When discussing solutions to 

reach this goal more effectively, 
Philbert 
emphasized 
the 

importance of using the humanities 
to connect with people rather 
than relying solely on science and 
numbers.

“Let’s 
not 
underestimate 

the power of the humanities in 
describing the world, describing 
society and the power of using 
the narrative rather than the 
measurement,” Philbert said. “One 
of the ways that President Schlissel 
has articulated this is by placing 
a greater emphasis on public 
engagement.”

Sami Malek, Senate Assembly 

member and associate professor 
of internal medicine, discussed the 
need for more open dialogue, since 
many faculty members believe they 
will be marginalized or labeled if 
they stand up for an issue that is 
important to them.

“We ought to look at the way 

we are permissive towards open 
dialogue,” Malek said. “There are 
many places in this University and 
this society that are not open to 
open dialogue, and unless people 
feel that they can say what’s 
on their mind without feeling 
ostracized for it, I think we’re 
missing the boat.”

about normative narratives of 
transpeople coming out as feeling 
like people are trapped in the 
wrong body when they’re a kid,” 
ze said. “I actually came out as 
trans in my late twenties.”

At the time Nicolazzo worked 

at the University of Arizona, 
primarily 
with 
students 
in 

fraternity 
and 
sororities. 
Ze 

moved to Ohio where ze attended 
Miami University to pursue hir 
Ph.D. in Student Affairs in Higher 
Education, and saw it is as chance 
to start over and come out.

In deciding on a topic for hir 

dissertation, Nicolazzo explained 
ze wanted to think about what 
life was like for people who 
didn’t necessarily have the same 
privilege that ze had, to move to a 
new place. Ze noted ze didn’t have 
a traditional transgender college 
experience.

“When I moved to Ohio I didn’t 

really have a whole lot of trans or 
gender nonconforming or gender 

queer people to spend time with,” 
ze said. “So I thought doing this 
research would be a way not 
only to write my community into 
existence but to find a community 
to spend time with in the first 
place, and really try to think 
about how we could do this 
project together — me and the 
participants.”

Nicolazzo explained what ze 

called the transgender paradox 
— that there appeared to be a 
lot of research and writing on 
the transgender identity, new 
communities, new industries and 
new disciplines in the late-20th 
century, yet there was not a lot of 
research on transgender college 
students.

As part of hir work, Nicolazzo 

spent 
18 
months 
with 
nine 

transgender college students; ze 
spent time on campus without 
them, observing the campus, and 
then spent time with them. Ze 
traveled to the places the students 
enjoyed on campus and those they 
avoided, as well as the events and 
classes they attended. 

In 
compiling 
hir 
findings, 

Nicolazzo explained it wasn’t 

fair to simply pull together and 
“package” the common themes, 
because there are too many ways 
to consider one’s transness, gender 
and identity. Ze explained those 
identities change across time and 
space as well. Instead, ze explained 
ze wanted to discuss the ways in 
which the participants’ narratives 
converge, or arrive, at similar 
points, but also how they diverge, 
or depart from one another, so as 
to not lose outlying moments.

Ze explained the students ze 

observed seemed to understand 
what cultural discourses were 
operating on their campus.

“There 
was 
a 
binary 

understanding of gender,” ze 
said. “There were only two ways 
people could exist on that campus. 
You could either be a cisgender, 
nontrans man, or a cisgender, 
nontrans woman.”

Ze found the participants could 

easily articulate what these two 
groups looked like.

Additionally, 
Nicolazzo 

developed the term “compulsory 
heterogenderism.”

“Participants would talk about 

how their gender identities were 

erased and instead they were 
understood through stereotypical 
notions of sexuality,” ze said.

For example, one participant 

in Nicolazzo’s study identified as 
agender. This student explained 
identifying as agender would 
require an explanation for what 
agender meant. Since people don’t 
typically understand transness, 
the student explained, it was 
easier to identify as a lesbian, 
because that is how this person 
was perceived.

“This is about cultural erasure,” 

ze said. “Both the notion of 
compulsory heterogenderism and 
the gender binary discourse are 
what I call twin cultural realities. 
This is kind of the cultural ether 
in the air and constructs college 
campuses as spaces in which trans 
people are not understood nor can 
they be understood.”

Another key component of 

Nicolazzo’s discussion was talk 
of resilience. However, ze wasn’t 
interested in using the word in 
the stereotypical sense, where it 
is often paired with words like 
grit. Ze explained the notion of 
grit implies one is living in a toxic 

environment and individualizes 
the reality of someone needing 
to push through, rather than 
considering the negative cultural 
climate itself. 

Nicolazzo 
explained 

participants did many things 
to navigate their toxic climate. 
Some described not walking past 
certain areas, what ze described 
as a practice of resilience. Some 
would listen to music or text as 
they walked.

“All of these (are) small, little 

micro-examples of how it is that 
we’re able to navigate through our 
day.”

Nicolazzo also discussed what 

ze described as the labor of being 
trans on campus.

“The ways in which knowledge 

is commodified and packaged 
and basically sold to students 
who are then seen as consumers 
of that knowledge and then spill 
it out all over tests … in much the 
same way these trans participants 
were often put on the spot to do 
the work of educating cisgender 
people on campus,” ze explained.

At a fall welcome event for the 

LGBTQ community at the school 

Nicolazzo observed, ze explained 
the chief diversity officer actually 
called on the trans and gender 
queer community to teach the rest 
of the community what they need 
to know.

“This was exhausting that 

students were basically told in no 
uncertain terms you need to teach 
us what we need to know: you 
different people — is the words 
that weren’t there — need to teach 
us normal people what we need to 
know,” ze said.

Nicolazzo 
explained 
hir 

findings don’t mean anything 
unless they are used to change 
how campuses are constructed.

Mark 
Chung 
Kwan 
Fan, 

assistant director for engagement 
at the Spectrum Center, said there 
is a lot of conversation around 
how to support trans students on 
campus. Fan explained Nicolazzo 
has been a pioneer in this space. 
He also said he thinks measures 
taken to support trans college 
students vary from college to 
campus.

Organizations and the School 
of Social Work Student Union. 
This 
year’s 
proposal 
also 

leans upon the University’s 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
strategic 
plan 
to 
argue 

divestment represents a campus 
commitment to inclusion by 
uplifting marginalized voices of 
Palestinian students. 

During CSG’s final meeting 

in 
October, 
more 
than 
50 

members of the Latinx Alliance 
for Community Action, Support 
and Advocacy, expressed their 
support of divestment as well.

 “It is my moral obligation 

to stand here in solidarity with 
my Palestinian brothers and 
sisters,” Public Policy senior 
Gloriela Iguina-Colon said. “As 
Latinx people we know what 
it feels like to be run out of 
our homes, to know that there 
are 
legacies 
of 
colonialism 

persisting today, to feel in 
our souls the pain of ours and 
others’ oppression, to know 
that our liberation is bound 
together.”

 For many Jewish and pro-

Israel students, the implications 
of a resolution for divestment 
align 
with 
the 
broader 

Boycott, Divest and Sanctions 
movement, though SAFE states 
its resolution is unaffiliated. 
Many Jewish students said 
they feel divestment promotes 
anti-Semitism. 
University 
of 

Michigan Hillel, an organization 
providing 
programming 
for 

Jewish students on campus, 
recently circulated a petition for 
students who oppose divestment 
and the BDS movement to sign.

 In a statement to The Daily, 

LSA senior Joshua Blum, chair 
of Hillel, said the petition is 
evident 
of 
the 
resolution’s 

divisiveness. 

 “The resolution pits different 

student groups against each 
other, rather than promoting 
the diversity of voices,” he said. 
“For me, I oppose divestment 
because I feel as if it targets the 
one Jewish state unfairly and it 
is not conducive to solving the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict.”

 Last January, after the 

2016 resolution to divest on 
the University campus failed 
by a vote of 34-13, then-LSA 
junior Gaby Roth — a CSG 
representative — and then-LSA 
sophomore Eli Schrayer — a CSG 
representative and member of 
Hillel — proposed a resolution 
to fund monthly luncheons 
to promote dialogue between 
sides of the Palestinian-Israeli 
conflict. Then-CSG president 
David Schaefer, an LSA senior, 
vetoed 
the 
effort, 
arguing 

CSG’s priorities did not align 
with the values put forth by the 
dialogues, and voiced concern 
SAFE did not sponsor the 
resolution. 

 The luncheon measure did 

not pass, even after the body’s 
judiciary committee overturned 
Schafer’s veto. Roth, along with 
members of the Palestinian 
and Israeli community, met 
unofficially four times, but still 
opposes the resolution due to its 
perceived ties to BDS.

 “It’s hard to see that this 

movement, the BDS movement 
that #UMDivest is part of, is 
anti-Semitic because it’s not 
necessarily blatant swastikas 
being painted around campus,” 
she said. “I think that at this 
point I can really relate to some 
of the calls to action in the 
resolution and I understand 
a lot of what they are saying 
just from hearing some of 
the author’s perspectives and 
stories and family history. It’s 
all real and it’s all their own 

truth. But with that said, I 
think that divestment is really 
problematic for a few reasons,” 
she said. “There are things 
happening in Israel that I really 
stand against, but at the same 
time it’s a complex issue and 
this just doesn’t paint the full 
picture.”

 
The 
Egyptian 
Student 

Association countered Blum’s 
points on division with an 
email 
statement. 
Supporting 

divestment, the board stated, 
is a cause uniting marginalized 
communities in their efforts 
to be heard and supported on 
campus. 

 
“ESA 
strongly 
supports 

SAFE’s mission to divest from 
companies that profit off the 
violation of human rights of 
the Palestinian people,” the 
statement reads. “ESA is part 
of a large campus coalition that 
stands with this movement,” 
it read. “This is what real 
DEI looks like — listening to 
marginalized 
and 
silenced 

voices on campus that are being 
amplified by communities of 
color. We urge CSG to listen to 
these communities and not to be 
complicit in this abuse.”

CSG 
representative 
Hafsa 

Tout, an LSA senior authored 
the resolution this year. She 
agreed on the need for dialogue, 
and emphasized its place within 
divestment. 

 “It’s not just dialogue between 

students at that point,” she 
said. “It’s an institutionalized 
conversation 
around 
this 

topic. If a committee—which 
the resolution calls for—will 
decide whether or not the 
University will divest, and to 
get there you have to start that 
institutionalized dialogue on 
the issue.” 

 Potential for Backlash
Even as SAFE members take 

action, they said they remain 

fearful of the repercussions of 
their activism. Divestment, they 
said, has received the support 
of faculty, including tenured 
professors, 
These 
faculty 

members, 
however, 
remain 

silent on the issue due to similar 
concerns of losing their jobs. 
A SAFE member argued the 
issue’s playing field is unlevel 
given no professors can publicly 
support the effort.

“The people who oppose 

the resolution usually bring in 
administration 
or 
professors 

to speak and have institutions 
backing them up,” the member 
said. “Although we have the 
same (support) as well, it’s 
that that institutional support 
cannot be voiced and show 
because they are scared.”

 
At 
first 
reads 
of 
the 

resolution last week, LSA Rep. 
Jay Cutler, a Public Health 
junior voiced concerns about 
the direct impact Palestinians 
face. One of the SAFE members 
answered the query to The 
Daily, 
describing 
the 
many 

threats affecting her day to day 
life.

“I 
know 
specifically 
a 

Palestinian student who was 
at the frontline of this issue, 
she literally attended therapy 
sessions because she was put 
on a blacklist for voicing her 
concerns about the violations 
of human rights of the people in 
her country,” she said.

 The SAFE member went 

on to argue consequences for 
speaking in favor of divestment 
play out differently in terms of 
student welfare than anti-divest 
students.

 “When you’re sitting there 

studying and then you get a 
tweet from a blacklist or a 
tweet that literally says we’re 
watching you, obviously that’s 
going to take away from your 
focus,” she said.

 The national — and global 

— context

Attempts 
at 
institutional 

action 
towards 
divestment 

at the University campus has 
primarily remained contained 
in CSG chambers. According 
to University spokesman Rick 
Fitzgerald, there has not been 
“involvement in this topic.” LSA 
senior Nicholas Fadanelli, LSA 
Student Government president, 
also confirmed he is not aware 
of divestment being brought to 
LSA SG.

 
In 
fact, 
no 
governing 

student body at any U.S. college 
or 
university 
had 
passed 

resolutions to divest from Israel 
until April 19, 2003, when Wayne 
State 
University’s 
Student 

Council voted 9-7 in favor to 
call upon its administration to 
divest from companies doing 
business 
with 
Israel. 
The 

Wayne State University Board 
of Governors signed a statement 
which reads: “Therefore be 
it resolved that the Board of 
Governors 
of 
Wayne 
State 

University supports the October 
2002 statement of the President 
and will not take action to 
divest the university in interests 
it may hold in companies that do 
business in Israel.”

 
Other 
local 
divestment 

efforts were soon successful, 
as the University of Michigan-
Dearborn’s student government 
passed 
a 
similar 
resolution 

one year later in 2004. For 
all of SAFE and #UMDivest’s 
struggles, 
U-M 
Dearborn’s 

Student 
Government 
passed 

five 
additional 
divest 

resolutions in six years. Though 
the group brought the measure 
to the same Board of Regents 
CSG reports to, yet none of the 
resolutions gained an actual 
foothold with the board after 
being deemed not in accordance 
with the board’s policy on 

student activism. 

 Outgoing U-M Dearborn 

student body President Fiana 
Arbab 
gave 
her 
farewell 

speech at the Board of Regents 
meeting held at the University’s 
Dearborn campus this March. 
Once 
again, 
she 
brought 

up 
the 
government’s 
most 

recent successful divestment 
resolution that passed last year. 

 
Regent 
Mark 
Bernstein 

(D) spoke out at the meeting, 
expressing his deep sentiments 
against BDS.

“I 
believe 
it 
is 
an 

intellectually bankrupt, morally 
repugnant expression of anti-
Semitism,” he said. He outlined 
a set of criteria known as the 
“3-D Test of Anti-Semitism” 
that argues the merits between 
constructive criticism of Israel 
and anti-Semitism.

 Arbab recounted the weeks 

leading up to the Regents 
meeting in an interview with 
The Daily. She said Schaefer, 
then-University student body 
president, repeatedly asked to 
review her address to the board, 
offering help and eventually 
suggesting to not bring up the 
divestment issue at all.

 “He had requested that I 

send him my speech for at least 
a week straight,” Arbab said. 
“He didn’t know exactly what 
I was going to do or say, but he 
did know that I was going to 
bring up divestment. He wanted 
to have a phone conversation 
with me in ‘preparation for the 
Regents meeting’ to help me 
out, and I knew exactly what he 
was doing. He tried to advise me 
on how I should bring it up, or 
like, ‘Maybe you shouldn’t bring 
it up at all, but if you did be very 
vague.’”

A

t first glance, the University 
(and only the University) 
causes 
the 
stress 
that 

defines many parts of our college 
lives. That stress has translated to 
action many times over; it seems 
that every other week, some 
coalition of students expresses 
its grievances toward University 
of Michigan President Schlissel. 
This academic year has been no 
different. In September there 
began more of a push to rename 
the C.C. Little Science Building; in 
October, Charles Murray; and this 
month, perhaps as a chaser for the 
acrimonious start to the year, East 
Quad Residence Hall dining hours. 
At the University, when students 
detect so much as a drop of blood 
shed by the University, you can say 
goodbye to nuance. Outrage and 
oppression take the wheel.

I 
myself 
am 
not 
entirely 

blameless of this mindset. I 
have been contemptuous of the 
University in the past; a few of 
my columns have even dealt 
with problems that I believe the 
University should address. Nor 
do I believe students must always 
acquiesce to the University. We pay 
a premium to attend the University 
of Michigan. There is something to 
be said about ensuring we have the 
best experiences here.

But is our university really so 

broken that we must harp on its 
small shortcomings, rather than its 
years of triumph? Must the student 
body so frequently drive a wedge 
between itself and the University?

On both counts, I found myself 

answering in the negative. I arrived 
at this answer not out of disdain, 
but from my Twitter feed. It was 
on my Twitter feed where, proudly 
displayed 
on 
the 
University’s 

Twitter account, I saw an homage 
to Janaki Ammal, the first woman 
to earn a U.S. doctorate in botany.

In the backdrop of our own 

seemingly taxing lives at the 
University, consider Ammal’s life. 
Ammal, one of 19 children, was 
born and raised in India. Although 
she was arranged to marry her first 
cousin, Ammal instead left for the 
United States after she earned a 
prestigious Barbour Scholarship 
from the University of Michigan. 
At the University, she first earned 
her master’s degree in 1925 and 
then her doctorate in botany in 
1931.

She 
then 
returned 
to 

Coimbatore, India, where she 
used her expertise in cytogenetics 
to create a high-yielding strain of 
sugarcane that thrived in Indian 
conditions. Shortly thereafter in 
1935, Ammal was invited to be 

a research fellow at the Indian 
Academy of Sciences, but her status 
as a single woman of a low caste 
forced her to move to London to 
continue her research. Working 
in London during World War II, 
Ammal would describe to friends 
how she would dive under her bed 
during German night bombings 
and continue with her research the 
next day.

Stories of University alumni 

like Ammal put our own lives 
in 
perspective. 
Ammal 
used 

the University to explore and 
to innovate. For Ammal, the 
University was not an infringer, 
an impediment or an institution 
confining us to our daily routines. 
The University was instead a 
bridge, moving her from poverty 
in India to international acclaim in 
the sciences. For those of us today 
who inevitably hail from more 
fortunate backgrounds, Ammal’s 
story still offers valuable lessons, 
like the need to step back and 
considers the University’s storied 
history before embarking on our 
own diatribes.

Lessons 
like 
these 
hold 

true in the stories of the other 
impressive alumni emblazoning 
the University’s Twitter feed. 
There were the familiar names, 
of course, like Desmond Howard, 
the University’s stud wide receiver 
who won the Heisman in 1991, 
and Larry Page, the co-founder 
of Google. But the University 
predominantly celebrated some 
of its less well-known, but equally 
impressive alumni like Ammal. 
There was William Mayo, who 
co-founded the Mayo Clinic in 
1889; Frances E. Allen, he first 
woman to win the Turing Award 
for her high-speed computing 
innovations; and Robert Shiller, 
who shared the 2013 Nobel Prize in 
economics.

For the unaware, the surge in 

alumni 
acknowledgments 
and 

folklore comes as the University 
celebrates its Bicentennial. The 
University has used the hashtag 
#umich200 to honor alumni like 

Ammal, Howard and Mayo.

For the cynics on campus, the 

Bicentennial is easy fodder. A 
cursory look at the Bicentennial 
celebration flatly reads as another 
distraction to dodge on the walk 
through the Diag. And, for that 
matter, is this even the University’s 
true Bicentennial?

A little research reveals that 

yes, it is in fact the University’s 
true Bicentennial, and, yes, the 
Bicentennial celebration is more 
than a Diag nuisance. If it were 
not for the University’s prolonged 
celebration of its Bicentennial, 
perhaps the stories of Janaki 
Ammal, William Mayo or Frances 
E. Allen would have remained 
sparsely told. If nothing else, 
the 
Bicentennial 
celebration 

has done a commendable job in 
acknowledging our University’s 
history.

Possessing 
a 
deeper 

understanding 
and 
knowledge 

of the University’s history helps 
us when we feel tempted to lash 
out at the University. For the 
students who feel bogged down 
by the stresses of University life 
and for those who feel the need to 
issue demands toward President 
Schlissel, the Bicentennial reminds 
us that our most notable alumni 
worked with the University rather 
than in opposition.

It does not invalidate our 

rights as students on campus. 
We deserve the best here, and 
it is within our jurisdiction to 
hold the University to the best 
standards. But celebrations like 
the Bicentennial that honor people 
like Janaki Ammal should give us 
perspective on how lucky we are 
to be at this University. There is a 
wealth of potential for us to seize 
on campus.

And while protest is a right 

guaranteed to us all, something 
I touched upon in a previous 
column, we would do better 
to remember the great people 
and the storied history of our 
University. We are a part of 
the University, not a foil to 
it. Consider the role of the 
University in the life of alumni 
that 
the 
Bicentennial 
has 

illuminated. Appreciate that we 
go to a University that takes pride 
in alumni like Janaki Ammal — 
not all schools celebrate their 
history. Ally with the University 
and who knows, maybe when the 
tricentennial comes along, you, 
too, will be mentioned in kind.

W

hen I was about five 
years old, I found 
a picture book in 

the children’s section of my 
neighborhood library with an 
illustration of a mass of KKK 
members 
in 
white 
sheets, 

riding horses down a hill. I 
don’t know whether the book 
was about Reconstruction or 
the civil rights movement, but 
that image has been a visceral, 
scarring memory ever since. I 
had no idea what the KKK was, 
but it was one of the first times 
I instinctively felt utter fear. 
My stomach still drops each 
time I think about it.

With civil rights and public 

interest lawyers as parents, 
I had picture books about 
Harriet 
Tubman, 
Frederick 

Douglass and Ruby Bridges. In 
my family’s annual Passover 
seders, we talk about the 
connection 
between 
the 

enslavement and centuries-
long persecution of Jews, and 
the enslavement of African 
people and persecution Black 
people throughout the world 
deal with today. We talk about 
the responsibility we feel to 
work for equity and justice.

So when in my first semester 

at the University of Michigan 
I learned there was strong 
presence of KKK sentiment 
just 30 minutes away from 
campus, I was naively but 
seriously unnerved. I looked 
more closely at hate group 
maps 
from 
the 
Southern 

Poverty Law Center. I talked 
with folks about the way that 
chapter’s existence impacts 
the 
movement 
of 
people 

throughout 
the 
state 
and 

its psychological effect on 
residents near the chapter. 
Of course, in my time at the 
University we have seen white 

supremacy surface above its 
daily institutional and cultural 
presence 
to 
interpersonal 

violence, pseudoscience fliers, 
a 
student-organized 
debate 

and more.

On Aug. 11 and 12, white 

supremacists 
converged 
in 

Charlottesville. They brought 
with 
them 
anti-Blackness, 

antisemitism, 
xenophobia, 

Islamophobia and hatred for 
anyone who “isn’t a member of 
their respective communities.” 
If that were my campus, I 
probably would have been 
in the crowd of counter-
protesters. While swastikas 
are triggering for me, I think 
I would mostly not have felt 
threatened as a Jew because 
white 
privilege 
allows 
me 

to pass as Christian. But I 
would have been terrified as 
an unarmed young person 
standing up to a mob in military 
gear. I would have been a 
target with a masked identity, 
a complex positionality I often 
feel in this political moment.

I don’t want to have to make 

that choice of whether or not 
to show up to protest against a 
mob of white supremacists, but 
if University President Mark 
Schlissel and the Board of 
Regents allow Richard Spencer 
to come to campus, I will have 
to. Let’s make it so that none of 

us have to make this decision. 
Join me in demanding the 
University 
deny 
Spencer’s 

request to speak on campus. 
Sign the petition, write a letter 
and ask alumni, friends and 
family to do the same. 

As a student organizer, I 

think a lot about who feels like 
they belong on this campus and 
how I can help make it so that 
more and more people feel that 
way. The white supremacists 
who 
marched 
through 

University 
of 
Virginia’s 

campus took a space away from 
students, professors and staff 
who cultivate it, but the reality 
is that many marginalized 
students have likely never felt 
that space totally belonged to 
them.

At our predominantly white, 

higher-income 
institution, 

we white people — especially 
those 
of 
us 
from 
higher-

income backgrounds — need to 
lean into the things that help 
our fellow Wolverines feel 
welcome and safe. Michigan 
is a battleground. We need to 
call out bigotry. We sometimes 
need to put our bodies on the 
line. We need to check-in with 
and check our friends. We need 
to report bias incidents in class 
instead of worrying about our 
grades and recommendation 
letters. We need to be in spaces 
where we are the minority 
(if we’re welcome) and listen. 
We need to set goals for self-
education. We need to actively 
acknowledge 
that 
this 
is 

America and this is real, but 
this is not us.

MICHAEL MORDARSKI| COLUMN

“

I never use the word very. 
It is a very weak word.”

That quote from former 

Secretary of Defense Donald 
Rumsfeld 
is 
written 
on 
a 

whiteboard above my desk.

It’s there alongside other 

quotes from an almost comically 
diverse group of writers and 
public 
figures, 
which 
the 

warmongering 
Rumsfeld 
is 

a part of. Quotes from Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg, George Carlin, 
Khaled Hosseini and Aaron 
Sorkin overfill this whiteboard 
in fading dry-erase colors.

And as an avid reader and 

writer, I like to think they 
serve as reminders about how 
effective written and verbal 
communication can be within 
our world.

No matter how poorly others 

may think of my writing, I 
take pride in my efforts when 
attempting to thread together 
words and thoughts in order to 
inspire emotion and motivation 
within my readers (see my 
article “We smug liberals”).

And if I could do anything in 

the world, it would be writing 
speeches for a future president 
of the United States.

Yet, this passion I have 

for writing is restricted to a 
single language. I have not 
truly expanded these skills 
and talents into anything other 
than English.

Sure, as LSA students here, 

we are required to develop 
proficiency 
in 
a 
foreign 

language. And most likely, 
many of us, after years of 
tepid practice in elementary 
and high school, develop a 
beginner’s 
fluency 
in 
our 

language of study. But in the 
overall spectrum of our higher 
education, the courses are not 
properly 
stressed 
as 
being 

equal to the core requirements 
for our degrees — but they 
should be.

The importance of another 

language 
is 
paramount 
in 

the rapidly changing world. 
Physical distance no longer 
matters as the instantaneous 
connection between countries 
continues to expose us to 
new 
people, 
cultures 
and 

economies.

Participating in this new 

hyper-connected 
world 

requires 
learning 
new 

languages in order to break 
down the final barriers holding 

us 
back 
from 
connections 

across the globe.

America has a language skills 

problem. 
My 
self-absorbed 

story at this university is not 
even remotely exclusive. Across 
the country, foreign language 
is viewed as secondary to the 
more emphasized core courses 
within education. 

The Atlantic published a 

piece last year that highlighted 
the ineffective way in which 
our education system teaches 
foreign languages throughout 
the 
country. 
The 
author, 

Amelia Friedman, argued that 
foreign language courses are 
not prioritized, which has a 
massive impact on students 
early on. The secondary level at 
which we value these courses 
prevents the proper funding, 
emphasis and applicability of 
learning a new language within 
schools early on.

This lack of prioritization 

creates low enrollment levels 
in which a cycle emerges where 
fewer students study a foreign 
language, and less work is put 
in to promote such courses.

And 
even 
the 
languages 

that 
are 
studied 
are 
still 

primarily European and not 
applicable of the emerging 
global markets. According to 
Friedman’s article, “In 2013, 
roughly 198,000 U.S. college 
students were taking a French 
course; just 64, on the other 
hand, were studying Bengali. 
Yet, globally, 193 million people 
speak Bengali, while 75 million 
speak French.”

Mandarin, Arabic, Bengali 

and Hindi — all languages on 
which we place less emphasis, 
despite them being some of 
the most widely spoken in the 
world. All these languages 
of peoples and markets are 
ready to be connected to, but 
only if these communication 
barriers 
could 
be 
more 

effectively broken. 

In totality, the academic 

culture we learn in can make 
people feel intimidated when 
they attempt to learn a foreign 
language. According to Richard 
Brecht, the founding executive 
director and founder of the 
Center for Advanced Study of 
Language at the University of 
Maryland, “It isn’t that people 
don’t think language education 
important. It’s that they don’t 
think it’s possible.” Learning 
a new language is challenging, 
and maintaining it is even more 
difficult within the United 
States, as there is often a lack 
of opportunities to practice 
and maintain such skills.

But the world has shrunk; the 

globalized economies we live in 
can provide such connections. 
Prioritizing foreign languages 
would further encourage us to 
study these courses and be able 
to transfer such skills to the 
professional world.

To be clear, the teachers 

and instructors are not the 
ones at fault here. Personally 
speaking, 
here 
at 
the 

University of Michigan, I have 
had some of the most hard-
working, passionate and caring 
instructors who deeply cared 
about students gaining this 
immensely resourceful skill, 
and I know fellow students 
who have felt the same way 
about other instructors.

I 
just 
wish 
there 
was 

greater emphasis placed on 
this 
requirement, 
not 
only 

in college and high school, 
but far earlier on within our 
elementary classrooms as well.

I take pride in my writing 

and communication, but I have, 
in the most underachieving 
way, restricted myself from 
billions of others in our world.

There is another quote on 

my 
whiteboard 
that 
comes 

from George Carlin. He was 
once said: “Language is the 
most 
elementary 
aspect 
to 

our 
humanness, 
probably. 

In addition to that, it’s the 
embodiment, it’s the apotheosis 
of the human experience, it’s the 
way we summarize ourselves.”

Learn another language; the 

world is a small place.

Disclaimer: OK, look. At this 

point, everyone just needs to 
get over it. Clearly this isn’t 
an actual, profound, biweekly 
treatise on food and the culture 
surrounding it. Clearly I’m not 
qualified for this (but who’s 
qualified for anything, really?). 
And, clearly, I’m just using this 
“food column” as a pretense 
to 
write 
about 
nebulously 

food-adjacent things I find 
interesting. Let’s all just accept 
this and move on.

With 
that 
being 
said, 

here’s a hypothetical scene of 
Thanksgiving at the Pioneer 
Woman’s house. For those of 
you who aren’t Food Network-
heads (boo), have fun hanging 
out with Ree Drummond, Ina 
Garten, Chris Santos, Marc 
Murphy, Scott Conant, Geoffrey 
Zakarian, Marcus Samuelsson, 
Alex Guarnaschelli, Giada de 
Laurentiis, Bobby Flay and 
Guy Fieri. Apparently there are 
those out there who don’t know 
who these people are.

The 
boys 
are 
outside 

cleaning up with Ladd. Paige 
and Alex are inside doing each 
other’s hair. The kitchen smells 
of butter and heavy cream and 
vaguely 
ethnically 
inspired 

foods. It’s Thanksgiving, and 
Ree Drummond is happy.

It’s been so long since I’ve felt 

this feeling of … warmth, she 
thinks, for a fleeting moment, 
before she’s interrupted by the 
doorbell. The guests are here!

What 
enchanting, 

bewildering fun. Entertaining 
has always been a staple of 
Ree’s 
lifestyle; 
thank 
God 

Ina let her host this year. Ree 
puts down her copy of Mrs. 
Dalloway and rushes to answer 
the door.

Speak of the devil: It’s her.
“Oh hey, Ree!” she exclaims 

with feigned excitement. They 
hug as if they actually like 
each other. Ugh. “Jeffrey will 
be here in a bit. He’s just going 
to find parking.”

“Well, you can just park 

anywhere in the field,” Ree 
says. “We’ve got so much open 
space.”

“We just wanted to find a…

parking lot,” she replies. “The 
ranch is gorgeous, though!”

Ina walks inside and sets 

down her dish wrapped in 
tinfoil. 
She 
looks 
around 

before 
placing 
it 
in 
the 

warming drawer beneath the 
oven. Ree knows what it is — 
she just can’t believe it.

The stupid lemon chicken. 

A simple mixture of herbs 
and olive oil, lemon wedges 
and slices of onion covering 
the width of the chicken, all 
roasted in a pan — and for 
what? The insipid taste of 
lemon and garlic infused in a 
dry slice of chicken? There’s 
already a turkey. Ree plots to 
“forget” the dish in the drawer. 
Take that, Barefoot Contessa.

The bell rings again. Ree 

can hear too many voices at 
the door, so she knows who 
it is: The Chopped Boys. She 
laughs at the thought of their 
group tattoo, which is actually 
spelled Chopt Boiz, but that 
wouldn’t fly in Oklahoma.

She opens the door and 

laughs; it’s always great to see 
the boys. They might air back-
to-back, but they never can 
seem to find the time.

Chris, Scott, Aaròn, Marc, 

Marcus, 
Geoffrey 
and, 
of 

course, Alex. She always was 
the outsider. Ted didn’t come, 
though. No one on that show 
likes Ted.

“Hey, 
Aaron, 
brought 

anything good this year?” says 
Ree.

“Ree, mija, you know it’s 

pronounced Aaròn,” he replies. 
They all laugh and hug each 
other.

Except for Scott, of course. 

Scott never laughs.

It’s a warm and inviting 

atmosphere, and Ree is in a 
good place. The kids have been 
great, of course, and Ladd is 
still such a great and stoic 
rock for her, but… It’s been 
so long since Ladd has shown 
her any affection. Sometimes, 
she thinks, this whole rugged, 
country lifestyle might be 
getting the better of their 
marriage. Would it be better 
if they left? Would the boys 
still be men and the girls still 
be ladies? Would “The Pioneer 
Woman” still be a brand? Ah, 
well. Thoughts for another 
day, she concludes.

After the big shots arrive — 

Giada, Bobby and, yes, Guy — 
it’s time to begin the feast. The 
boys run back inside and Paige 
and Alex come downstairs. 
Bobby ruffles the boys’ hair 
like a proud uncle. It truly is 
a family at The Food Network.

Ree has made her specialty: 

meatloaf. Some people might 
laugh, but there’s nothing that 
screams Oklahoma more than a 
thick, sweaty slab of meatloaf. 
Douse that in ketchup and 
you might as well be yelling 
“Boomer Sooner” in Norman! 
Ree chuckles to herself as she 
places the dish on the table. 
It jiggles as she sets it down. 
Yum.

Aaròn has brought maíz 

tortillas 
to 
fill 
with 
a 

beautifully grilled skirt steak 
and 
chimichurri, 
courtesy 

of Marcus. (Ree catches Ina 
mouthing the words, “store-
bought” to Giada on the side of 
the room.) Chris hasn’t brought 
food, but, as always, he’s 
brought his guitar — he’s the 
post-dinner 
entertainment, 

always has been.

Bobby 
and 
Giada 
have 

collaborated (not for the first 
time, Ree thinks to herself) 
on a shitty bowl of pasta 
with a “Southwestern twist!” 
Great job, sellouts. Ree tries 
to 
obscure 
this 
with 
her 

immaculately 
constructed 

centerpiece.

Geoffrey and Scott procure, 

seemingly out of nowhere, 
a fully cured ham. It’s been 
sitting in Scott’s basement 
in Great Neck for months, 
apparently. 
Ina 
shoots 

him 
a 
 
“Great-Neck?-It’s-

No-Hamptons” 
look 
as 
he 

explains. Geoffrey pulls the 
finest switchblade, made in 
Switzerland, and shaves it in 
the finest slices known to man.

Finally, they let Guy bring 

out 
his 
famous 
“Bloomin’ 

Onion, Guy’s Way.” It’s just 
a Bloomin’ Onion he bought 
from Outback Steakhouse that 
he put in a deep fryer again. 
They let him have this, every 
year. It makes him feel valued.

Ree 
makes 
everyone 
sit 

down quickly and smirks at 
Ladd — he knows she’s just 
negged 
Ina, 
HARD. 
They 

squeeze hands under the table. 
This feels right.

“Oh my God, guys, no,” says 

Geoffrey. “We forgot to invite 
Ayesha!”

There’s a moment of silence 

before 
they 
all 
burst 
out 

into 
laughter. 
Always 
the 

comedian, Geoffrey.

But then Ina makes a motion. 

Of course she does.

“Wait, guys!” she exclaims, 

her exasperated hands waving. 
She rushes over to the oven 
and pulls out the dreaded 
lemon chicken. She rips off the 
tinfoil and places it right in 
the center, for everyone to see. 
Bitch.

And then Ree sees it. A 

smile creeps onto her face. The 

Contessa has no idea what’s 

about to happen.

“Are those… are those red 

onions?” Scott trembles at the 
sight before him. Geoffrey’s 
face turns gaunt. Alex turns to 
the rest of The Chopt Boiz and 
screams.

Geofrrey grabs Scott by the 

face and turns him. “Scott, 
no,” he whispers. “You can 
fight this. You are stronger 
than this.”

Scott’s 
face 
is 
now 
an 

unrecognizable shade of red. 
Ree is scared, but secretly 
happy. She steals a glance at 
Ina’s confused, horrified face. 
It’s glorious.

“THE 
ACIDITY!” 
Scott 

screams. It’s a lost cause now. 
“RAW RED ONION IS TOO 
ACIDIC FOR MY PALATE!”

He flips the table with 

seemingly 
unknown 
force. 

Everything falls to the floor. 
He rips off his shirt. Ree 
notices 
he’s 
surprisingly 

jacked, but makes sure to 
comment on that at a later 
time.

“TAKE IT AWAY FROM ME! 

CRUCIFY THAT BANSHEE! 
THAT EVIL HAG! BANISH 
HER FROM OKLAHOMA!”

Ina is terrified. She begins 

to apologize, but Jeffrey puts a 
finger to her lips. He grabs her 
by the arm and the two of them 
sprint out.

Ree 
surveys 
the 
scene. 

Geoffrey massages Scott’s back 
as he crouches on the ground, 
panting. The worst is over for 
now. Alex and the rest of the 
gang are crying. Bobby and 
Giada are nowhere to be seen, 
but a thumping sound is heard 
from the upstairs bedroom. 
Guy picks at a tortilla fondly.

Ree turns to Ladd and plants 

a kiss right on his mouth.

“I love Thanksgiving.”

COURTESY OF SMTD

SMTD’s ‘Blood at the 
Root’ to challenge, inspire

“This 
piece 
is 
not 
for 

the faint of heart,” wrote 
Music,Theatre & Dance and 
LSA senior Elyakeem Avraham 
in an email interview with The 
Daily.

Avraham 

will be playing 
De’Andre, 
one 

of the six teens 
depicted 
in 

the 
SMTD’s 

upcoming 
performance 
of 

“Blood 
at 
the 

Root.” The play 
centers 
around 

the Jena Six, a 
group 
of 
black 

teenagers 
who, 

in 
December 

of 
2006, 
were 

convicted 
of 

beating 
Justin 

Barker, a white 
student at Jena High School in 
Louisiana.

Written 
by 
Dominique 

Morisseau for Penn State’s 2014 
graduate acting class, “Blood 
at the Root” is fictitious, 
using the historical event as a 
launching point for the story to 
unfold. A member of the class, 
SMTD director Stori Ayers was 
a producer and an original cast 
member of Morisseau’s 2014 
production.

“We were the winner of 

the Graham F. Smith Peace 
Foundation Prize for its (“Blood 
at the Root”) promotion of 
human rights,” Ayers wrote. 
“[We] have taken this play to 
many high schools and all the 
Penn State Branch campuses to 
do outreach and social justice 
workshops in hopes of starting 
a conversation and igniting 
within our generation a spirit 
of activism.”

The play aims to challenge 

both the audience and the 
history it’s developed from, 
and Ayers is imbuing SMTD’s 
performance with the same 
fire as the show’s origin.

“[The] 
story’s 
specificity 

creates a universality that 
charges the audience with 
the social responsibility of 
dealing with the ‘other’ in 
order to create change,” Ayers 

explained. 
“Everyone 
has 

an ‘other’; whether based in 
sexuality, race or gender, we 
all deal with people who are 
unlike ourselves. This play 
explores the experiences of a 
group of high school students 
desperately trying to define 
themselves 
and 
navigate 

around those who identify 

themselves 
differently.”

Working 

as 
Associate 

Choreographer 
in addition to his 
role as De’Andre, 
Avraham 
was 

drawn 
to 
the 

show 
for 
its 

content.

“When 
Jena 

Six happened in 
2006, I was one 
of the leaders in 
a protest against 
the charges that 
the 
Jena 
Six 

faced,” he wrote. 
“For 
12 
days 

straight, about 300 students 
wore all black to school in 
solidarity with those facing 
charges in the Jena Six case. 
It escapes people that racial 
injustices, such as this one, 
happened only 11 years ago and 
continue to happen today.”

Compelling and expository, 

“BATR” isn’t meant to just 
entertain. It’s a story of self-
agency and the resiliency of the 
human spirit, and it’s intended 
to affect — whatever form that 
may take.

Other cast members Charda 

Jameson (SMTD, sophomore), 
Kathleen 
Taylor 
(SMTD, 

junior), 
Sierra 
Stephens 

(SMTD, sophomore) and Eddie 
Williams (SMTD/LSA, senior) 
spoke with The Daily on what 
being in the play means for 
them:

“When I read this play for 

the first time last year, the 
thing that stuck to me the 
most was the fact that each 
and every character in the play 
struggles with a certain aspect 
of their own social identity 
and cultural context in a very 
humanizing 
way,” 
Stephens 

recalled. “As a white person in 
this piece, being here means 
putting my white privilege 
on the table for analysis. It 
means showing the white-

identifying community what it 
means to recognize privilege 
and what it means to confront 
the 
systematic 
racism 
we 

perpetuate every day.”

“BATR” 
is 
self-aware, 

and it’s cast embodies this 
sentiment — knowing that the 
world isn’t OK, and people 
sometimes 
aren’t 
OK, 
but 

collectively we can be.

“(The play) portrays young 

people as fiercely intelligent, 
deeply feeling human beings. I 
think it’s rare to find a piece of 
media that takes teenagers so 
seriously,” Taylor wrote.

A thoughtful piece, “BATR” 

hopes to give a holistic view on 
modern-day racism.

“(The 
audience) 
should 

expect 
to 
see 
different 

perspectives and viewpoints, 

both from people involved in 
the issues that arise and the 
people that actively choose to 
stay out of them,” Williams 
mentioned.

Telling a story that needs 

to be heard, the show makes 
sure to involve moments of 
light to keep the performance 
charming.

“Peope should expect to 

be moved in ways that are 
uncomfortable, but to also 
go on a fun ride, with dance 
and comic relief mixed in our 
piece,” Jameson noted.

No matter the background 

you’re coming from, “Blood 
at the Root,” promises to be 
hopeful and provoking. The 
performance is scheduled for 
this Thursday evening in the 
Arthur Miller Theater.

‘Shameless’ takes on the 
Trump era in season 8

Standing in her bra and 

underwear, 
staring 
at 
an 

unclothed Tinder match, Fiona 
Gallagher 
(Emmy 
Rossum, 

“You’re 
Not 
You”) 
shakes 

her head and proclaims “I 
can’t do this anymore.” It is a 
moment of self-determination 
and realization; in a single 
sentence, this woman who has 
struggled through hell and 
high water decides that she’s 
had enough — enough with 

random hookups and enough 
with the way life tosses her 
around. As she smiles at the 
blurred lights of Chicago’s 
skyline while the chorus of 
PrettyDeep’s 
“SugarCane” 
synths 
in 
the 

background, 
one 

thing 
becomes 

glaringly 
clear: 

these are not the 
Gallaghers 
we 

have seen before.

In 
its 
eighth 
season, 

“Shameless” 
looks 
to 

transform 
its 
lovable, 

degenerate characters in a way 

that keeps them true to their 
disposition while remaining 
pertinent in 2017. Gone are the 
Gallaghers of 2011, dancing 
on the edge of poverty on 

the 
southside 

of 
Chicago. 

These are the 
Gallaghers 
of the Trump 
years, 
and 

they’ve 
got 

newfound 
money in their 

pockets to spend (albeit as a 
result of pushing their dead 
mom’s 
meth) 
and 
mended 

futures to pursue. And while 

SAMANTHA DELLA FERA

the Trumpian effect is evident 
in the show it is nowhere near 
centerstage — at least not 
yet. Newly militarized Carl 
(Ethan Cutkowsky, “Law & 
Order: SVU”) laments over 
the ungrateful elite. An ICE 
agent responds, “Do you really 
have to ask?” when asked why 
he only cares about illegal 
Mexican 
immigrants 
over 

Russian ones. Perhaps these 
ideas will be explored further 
as the season progresses, but 
right now, those lines serve 
the same purpose as the use 
of a fidget spinner in various 
scenes: “Shameless” is well-
aware of the trends and tirades 
of 2017, it’s just not ready to 
tackle them head-on quite yet.

But for once, that’s not a bad 

thing. The season premiere 
is filled to the brim with new 
plotlines 
that 
poignantly 

tackle 
very 
real 
and 
very 

relevant issues. Fiona exploits 
the benefits of gentrification 

with her latest tenant status. 
Debbie (Emma Kenney, “Epic”) 
looks directly into the face 
of collapsing trade industries 
when talking to her new welding 
classmates. 
Kevin 
(Steve 

Howey, “Blue & Green”) faces 
the stigma and uncertainty of 
male breast cancer. Only Frank 
(William H. Macy, “Room”) 
seems to be stuck in his old 
ways, continuing to blame his 
deceased wife and enabler for 
pretty much everything wrong 
in his life. Still, it seems that 
smoking a half-pound of meth 
has allowed him to reach some 
level of enlightenment. Every 
scene with Frank shows him 
apologizing 
to 
people 
he’s 

wronged over the past forty 
or so years (which, by the way, 
leads to the best line of the 
episode, in which he kneels at a 
tombstone and declares, “Wow, 
when you’re right, you’re right. 
I should’ve let you drive.”)

“Shameless” has finally freed 

its characters, allowing them to 
take control of their own lives 
rather than having to work 
with 
the 
continuous 
blows 

that life has delivered them. 
Of course, the show would 
not be the drama it is without 
conflict, and the fact that the 
Gallaghers and Co. are doing so 
well right now only means that 
their inevitable fall will hurt 
that much more. Eradicating 
the 
looming 
shadows 
of 

addiction and poverty let the 
characters look deeper into 
themselves and decide what 
kind of people they are going 
to be. Will they reverse back to 
their old, destructive ways? Or 
will they take the the high road 
out? These are the difficult 
questions driving the show 
as it teeters on the edge of 
becoming Showtime classic or 
just another series overstaying 
their welcome. I, for one, can’t 
wait to come along for the ride.

‘Daddy’s Home 2’ a failure

PARAMOUNT PICTURES

“Shameless”

Season 8 Premiere

Sundays @ 9 p.m. 

Showtime

The Christmas season has 

finally arrived, and with it, 
the inevitable tide of bad 
Christmas movies. We already 
got 
the 
astonishingly 
lazy 

“A 
Bad 
Mom’s 
Christmas” 

last week, and this week we 
come to “Daddy’s Home 2,” 
the sequel to the 2015 comedy 
that existed to make us forget 
how great Will Ferrell (“The 
House”) and Mark Wahlberg 
(“Transformers: 
The 
Last 

Knight”) 
were 
in 
“The 

Other Guys.” Now, its sequel 
doubles 
the 

number of dads 
and 
drenches 

everything in a 
Christmas veneer 
to 
distract 
the 

fact that there’s 
nothing going on 
underneath.

Of course, the 

shallowness would be easier 
to forgive if “Daddy’s Home 
2” were actually funny, and in 
all honesty, there are moments 
where it verges on entertaining. 
It’s nearly impossible to count 
more than five times when it 
actually crosses the line into 
chuckle-worthy, 
but 
there 

are set-ups here that briefly 
appear promising before they 
go to waste. The obligatory 
Christmas tree incident finds 
Brad 
(Ferrell) 
accidentally 

cutting down a cell phone 
tower. The family gets into 
a fight while participating 
in a live Nativity. The other 
patrons at a bowling alley get 
way too invested in how bad 
one of the kids is at the sport. 
A director dedicated to their 
premise would be able to guide 
their cast to comedic gold with 
any of these.

The 
problem 
is 
in 
the 

execution. 
In 
“The 
Other 

Guys,” the scenes that worked 
did so because Adam McKay 
was willing to let Ferrell and 
Wahlberg riff off each other. 
The extras on the Blu Ray are 
filled with alternate takes of 
the two taking a premise like a 
simple confrontation between 
their characters and running 
with it. With more outlandish 
ideas like the ones on display 
in “Daddy’s Home 2,” there’s 
little reason they couldn’t do 
the same, but director Sean 
Anders (“Horrible Bosses 2”) 
seems unwilling to allow his 
cast to let loose. Audiences are 
stuck with jokes and scenes 
that either fizzle out before 
they show any signs of life or, 
in the case of an unfortunate 
incest gag, probably shouldn’t 

have been written in the first 
place.

This is doubly disappointing 

considering the caliber of the 
cast. Ferrell, despite being 
in the middle of a streak of 
lackluster 
flicks 
like 
“The 

House” and “Zoolander 2,” is 
an icon of modern comedy, and 
on the rare occasions when 
“Daddy’s 
Home 
2” 
works, 

it’s because of him. Mark 
Wahlberg 
has 
also 
proven 

himself a more than capable 
leading man in both drama and 
comedy, and series-newcomer 
John Lithgow (“Miss Sloane”) 
— here playing Brad’s father, 
Don — has recently carved 
himself out a niche as a reliable 

character 
actor 

of 
genre 
and 

prestige fare.

Even 
John 

Cena 
(“The 

Wall”), 
known 

better 
for 
his 

professional 
wrestling 
persona, 
has 

shown himself to be willing 
to commit to insane stunts 
for big laughs in projects 
like “Tour de Pharmacy” and 
“Trainwreck.” But again, the 
material that would allow for 
this simply isn’t there. Instead, 
the talented cast languishes 
under the unfunny material 
and lackluster direction.

The obvious odd one out in 

the cast is Mel Gibson (“The 
Expendables 
3”). 
Like 
the 

rest of the cast, Gibson has 
proven his comedic chops in 
the past, but it’s hard to see 
what he brings to the role of 
Kurt, the father of Wahlberg’s 
Dusty, besides the discomfort 
of seeing the controversial 
actor 
essentially 
playing 
a 

toned-down version of himself 
for laughs. It seems like an 
example 
of 
cynical 
stunt 

casting more than anything 
else.

Still, “Daddy’s Home 2” is 

a Christmas movie, or at least 
it carries itself as one, so it’s 
important to view it through 
that lens. This is where the 
film fails the most. It has all 
the hallmarks of a holiday 
movie — the bickering family, 
the mall Santa, the lights-
related disaster — yet until 
the shoehorned delivery of 
the final message, it’s all 
surface level. Even “A Bad 
Mom’s Christmas” for how 
tired its script was, seemed to 
at least be written by people 
who enjoy the spirit of the 
season. In “Daddy’s Home 2,” 
there’s nothing but paper-thin 
characters paying unfunny lip 
service to the most wonderful 
time of the year.

Michigan finishes 1-2, both advance to NCAA Championships

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

cross 
country 
team 
came 

into the NCAA Great Lakes 
Regional as a heavy favorite 
after winning the Big Ten 
Championship. 

The Wolverines lived up 

to that expectation Friday, 
finishing 
first 
overall 
– 

outracing 
second-place 

Michigan State by 16 points. 
It 
was 
Michigan’s 
third 

consecutive regional win and 
sixth in the past seven years.

“It 
feels 
pretty 
good,” 

said Michigan coach Mike 
McGuire. “It’s a nice reward 
for the hard work the women 
have put in this year and a 
continuation of a nice legacy 
established in the past.”

The 
first-place 
finish 

guarantees 
the 
Wolverines 

an automatic bid to the NCAA 
Championships 
next 
week 

in Louisville, Ky. It will be 
Michigan’s 16th appearance 
in the championships – the 
third-longest 
qualifying 

streak in the nation.

Fifth-year 
seniors 
Gina 

Sereno and Jamie Morrissey 
led the Wolverines in the 
regional, finishing second and 
third, respectively. Morrisey 
improved her time from last 
year significantly, jumping up 
18 spots from 21st place.

“They’ve had an outstanding 

year,” McGuire said. “Jamie 
really has stepped up her 
game, running at the highest 
level she has ever been. Gina 
has just been a tremendous, 
steady 
force 
for 
the 
last 

several years, so you know, it’s 
definitely nice having a two-
headed attack to get started.”

The pair was never far 

behind 
Indiana 
runner 

Katherine 
Receveur, 
who 

finished 
first 
overall. 

Receveur was unsuccessful in 

carrying fifth-place Indiana 
to a qualifying spot at next 
week’s nationals. 

Michigan was the only team 

to finish with five runners in 
the top 30 – a key factor toward 
its 
success. 
Junior 
Claire 

Borchers finished 15th overall, 
another steep improvement 
from her 39th – place finish a 
year ago. Sophomore Madeline 
Trevisan finished 22nd and 
fifth year senior Haley Meier 
finish 29th. 

In terms of preparing for 

nationals 
next 
week, 
the 

Wolverines plan on continuing 
the routine that has worked 
well so far this season.

“There isn’t any magical 

workout 
that’s 
all 
(of 
a) 

sudden 
gonna 
change 
the 

world,” McGuire said. “I don’t 
see us improving our national 
ranking, but I don’t see us 
going backwards either. We’ll 
probably be eighth ranked 
nationally going in.”

A year after surprisingly missing 

out on the NCAA Championships, 
the No. 10 Michigan men’s cross-
country team came into this season 
seeking redemption. A top-two 
finish at the Great Lakes Regional 
Championship would ensure that 
the Wolverines would secure an 
NCAA berth this time around. 

Friday afternoon, they got the 

job done.

At LaVern Gibson Championship 

Course, Michigan punched its 
ticket to the national championship 
with a second-place finish. Led by 
a platoon of fifth-year seniors, the 
Wolverines posted an excellent 
team score of 79. Although No. 13 
Michigan State edged Michigan by 
11 points, coach Kevin Sullivan isn’t 
too worried about not winning the 
meet outright.

“Our focus has been on making 

nationals. That’s been our focus all 
year,” Sullivan said. “Today was 

just getting the job done, qualifying 
for nationals and keeping everyone 
healthy.”

As he has all season, fifth-year 

senior 
captain 
Ben 
Flanagan 

spearheaded the Michigan effort. 
Amidst a field of 268 elite runners, 
Flanagan stormed ahead for a 
first-place finish. Running with 
a combination of discipline and 
ferocity, he pounded his feet across 
the line with a time of 30:54 — an 
astonishing six seconds faster than 
his closest competitor.

“(Flanagan) has got a lot of 

talent,” Sullivan said. “And he backs 
that up with a lot of commitment 
and dedication to better himself in 
every area, both in athletics and 
academics. Those are traits that 
really set him apart.”

Flanagan 
wasn’t 
the 
only 

Wolverine that excelled, though. 
Fellow fifth-year senior Connor 
Mora also finished strong, ending 
up in seventh place. Three more 
Michigan runners finished in the 
top 26 — illustrating their valuable 

depth, and executing Sullivan’s 
strategy perfectly.

“We just wanted our guys to be 

in the main pack, in the all-region 
spots, and we felt that if we had five 
guys in the top-25, we’d go back to 
nationals,” Sullivan said. “We were 
a little short of that, our fifth guy 
was one spot out of all-region, but 
everything else kind of played out 
the way we planned.”

Next 
Saturday, 
Michigan 

will compete in the national 
championship race in Louisville. 
Out 
of 
30 
championship 

appearances, the Wolverines have 
failed to finish higher than fourth 
place. They have only finished in 
the top-10 once since 2004, but 
Sullivan believes Michigan is 
capable of it this year.

“Our focus is on trying to be a 

top-10 team next week,” he said.

If his team can repeat its 

performance from regionals, that 
finish is within its grasp.

They just need to get the job 

done — one last time.

‘M’ seeks villain role

The 
two 
most 
important 

weeks of the season have arrived 
for the Wolverines.

With its final two games of 

the year coming up against No. 
8 Wisconsin and No. 13 Ohio 
State, the Michigan football team 
(5-2 Big Ten, 8-2 overall) has 
one last chance to make a push 
into contention for the Big Ten 
Championship.

But in order to pull off the feat, 

Michigan will have to play spoiler. 
The Wolverines have embraced 
that role wholeheartedly.

“I think we’ve taken on the 

role of the villain a little bit,” said 
fifth-year senior center Patrick 
Kugler. 
“People 
have 
been 

doubting us, saying we haven’t 
beaten a team with a winning 
record this year — that’s kind of 
the big one that’s going around 
right now.

“The next two games are big 

ones, Wisconsin and Ohio State. 
So if we can come out on top, then 
the villain wins, and that’s kind 
of a fun role to play.”

It certainly won’t be easy. The 

Badgers are currently undefeated 
atop the Big Ten West standings, 
and the Buckeyes have only one 
conference loss to lead the Big 
Ten East faction. 

“We’ve got two big weeks, but 

we’re going to take it one week at 
a time,” said sophomore defensive 
end Rashan Gary. “... This whole 
week in practice is going to be 
getting after each other and 
making sure everything is perfect. 
We got an opportunity in front of 
us, and we don’t want to let it go.”

If Michigan manages to win 

both contests, a 10-2 season 
is within reach. That record, 
along 
with 
tiebreakers 
over 

the two highest-ranked teams 
in the conference, might be 
enough to guarantee a spot in 
Indianapolis for the Big Ten 
championship game. That’s been 
the Wolverines’ goal all along.

“Our goal is still to go to the 

Big Ten championship, and that’s 
still a possibility,” said junior 
receiver Grant Perry. “So we’re 
just gonna do what we can, and 

just win.”

A few weeks ago, the picture 

looked entirely different for 
Michigan.

After a blowout loss to then-

No. 2 Penn State, coupled with 
an unexpected loss to then-
unranked Michigan State two 
weeks before, the Wolverines 
were pushed out of consideration 
for the College Football Playoff.

Their season could have gone 

off the rails, but Michigan coach 
Jim Harbaugh made sure it 
didn’t.

“We talked about staying 

together as a family, as a team, 
especially after a couple of tough 
losses,” Kugler said. “And that’s 
exactly what we’ve done.”

The goal since then has been 

to win out. And Michigan is three 
games in and two games away 
from accomplishing that goal.

Meanwhile, the rest of the 

top competitors in the Big Ten 
have been knocking each other 
down a peg. Ohio State lost to 
Penn State, which then lost to 
Michigan State, which then lost 
to Ohio State. Now, the Nittany 
Lions and Spartans have two 
conference 
losses, 
just 
like 

Michigan — though the former 
two own those tiebreakers. The 
Buckeyes might only have one, 
but if the Wolverines beat them, 
the entire pool would be in for a 
chaotic finish.

Still, 
as 
Kugler 
noted, 

Michigan has been unable to 
shake off its doubters.

“I mean, obviously we’re not 

getting a lot of love in the playoff 
polls,” he said. “... But we’re a very 
tight-knit group. We know what 
we’re capable of, and we’re just 
excited for the chance.”

As far as the Wolverines are 

concerned, Wisconsin is just 
the next team on the schedule 
on their road to a possible Big 
Ten Championship berth. But 
stopping other teams along the 
way has become a new part of 
their goal.

“It’s just kind of fun to ruin 

seasons,” Kugler said. “... It’s just 
kind of fun to go into a hostile 
environment like Wisconsin and 
come away with a victory. There’s 
nothing better than that.”

Mike Rodriguez makes special appearance 
at Wolverine dual meet at Catholic Central

NOVI, Mich. — Friday night, 

Catholic Central’s high school 
gymnasium was filled to the 
brim. All sections of the blue 
bleachers 
had 
been 
pulled 

out to maximize capacity, but 
spectators 
still 
spilled 
into 

the upper deck. They lounged 
against the railings circling the 
deck, where numerous state 
championship banners hung. 

The Michigan wrestling team 

stood on the left side of the gym 
while Arizona State stood on the 
right. High school staff lined the 
edges of the mat, waiting for the 
meet to begin.

Everyone quieted down as the 

announcer began to talk. The 
two teams would wrestle, but 
before that, a man would lead the 
pre-meet prayer.

That 
man 
was 
Michigan 

wrestling legend and former 
Catholic Central coach Mike 
Rodriguez.

“That was great,” said senior 

Adam Coon. “That was great to 
have him here. There was a lot of 
tradition there, both for Catholic 
Central and for the University of 
Michigan. It was great to have 
him sitting on our bench and I 
definitely loved the prayer that 
he led with. That was a very class 
act, and I very much enjoyed 
having him on the bench with us 
for sure.”

Added Michigan coach Joe 

McFarland: “It was an honor to 
sit next to him on the bench — 
it was an honor to have him on 
our bench, I should say. I mean, 
you think about how many lives 
that guy has changed. Seriously. 
From 40 years of coaching here? 
There’s a lot of lives he molded.”

The prayer was short and 

brief, but it was everything it 
needed to be. Rodriguez handed 
the microphone back as quickly 
as he’d gotten it, but the audience 
didn’t let the brevity of the 
moment get away from them, 
applauding until he took his seat.

“Coach Rod” led the Catholic 

Central wrestling program for 40 

years, coaching the Shamrocks to 
seven state championship titles. 
He coached in over 730 dual 
meet wins, earning a spot as one 
of the winningest high school 
wrestling coaches in Michigan 
history.

When he was in high school, 

Rodriguez was a senior with 
15 
different 

collegiate offers. 
But he knew he 
wanted 
to 
go 

to 
Michigan. 

He 
ended 
up 

in prep school 
for a couple of 
years 
because 

he didn’t have 
the grades for 
Michigan yet. He 
had to focus on 
rigorous academics at that time, 
explaining how he had to sit in a 
room for an hour and write about 
a single topic.

He really wasn’t a fan of the 

intensity.

“I wrote half a page in a whole 

hour,” Rodriguez said. “I was not 

into the writing thing. I wrote 
half a page, came back bloody. 
He asked me, ‘Well, what are you 
doing in here?’ I said, ‘I’m gonna 
go to college.’ He says, ‘Well, 
where? Wayne State?’ And I said, 
‘No, I want to go to Michigan.’ 
And he said, ‘Michigan? You are? 
Who’s gonna help you?’ It was a 

struggle, but I 
got there and it 
was well worth 
it.”

Before 
his 

coaching career, 
he was a three-
time 
Big 
Ten 

champion 
and 

two-time NCAA 
finalist. He even 
was a member 
of the basketball 

team until he was cut between 
his sophomore or junior season. 
A new coach came in wanting 
to build his team around height. 
Rodriguez didn’t fit that mold.

He wasn’t happy about it, but 

he took it out on the mat. That 
seemed to pay off, as Rodriguez 

graduated as one of the most 
decorated Michigan wrestlers in 
history. He even went on to place 
fifth at the World Championships 
in Japan.

After that? He went home.
Rodriguez spent the next 

40 years coaching at Catholic 
Central. So with the Wolverines 
set to wrestle the Sun Devils 
at Catholic Central, it was only 
fitting that Rodriguez led the 
prayer.

“I saw a young man that 

was here when I had him as a 
freshman, some state placers, 
and it’s just such a joy to see them 
back again and still living and 
being productive,” Rodriguez 
said. “They own businesses or 
are doctors or lawyers, and it’s 
just such a blessing to work at 
this place because they come 
here to be successful.

“And you see all of (these 

banners) up on the wall, it’s all 
put up there by hard work. God 
tells us a man should know how 
to work hard, and that’s what I 
tried to teach them here.”

Notebook: Wolverines “excited” for first trip to Madison since 2009

It’s been a while since the 

Wolverines took a trip to Camp 
Randall Stadium. 

The Michigan football team 

hasn’t faced Wisconsin on the 
road since 2009, but that streak 
will finally be broken this 
Saturday.

The stage for the return 

couldn’t be much bigger. The 
fifth-ranked 
Badgers 
are 

out to defend an undefeated 
record. Michigan is dead set 
on winning out and hoping for 
some help that could place the 
Wolverines in contention for a 
Big Ten title. And for the second 
time this year, ESPN’s “College 
GameDay” will be on the scene 
prior to a Michigan kickoff.

The 
Wolverines 
boast 
a 

roster ready to get their first 
in-person 
taste 
of 
playing 

football in Madison.

“I 
actually 
visited 
Ben 

Bredeson, he has an older 
brother in my class,” said junior 
wide receiver Grant Perry. “I 
went back to his house a couple 
summers ago, met a couple of 
the Wisconsin players and they 
were all telling me about the 
“Jump Around” thing that they 
do, and how hype it gets. I’m 
excited for it personally.”

Added 
fifth-year 
senior 

Patrick Kugler: “I heard it’s 
awesome, 
one 
of 
the 
best 

environments in the country. 
… I’ve never played there (and) 
I’ve been here five years, so I 
was excited when we found out 
we were playing at Wisconsin. 
You want to play at every 
stadium and I haven’t had the 
opportunity to do that in the 
Big Ten unfortunately, even (in) 
five years.” 

AN 
UNCONVENTIONAL 

TASK: 
Despite 
losing 
T.J. 

Watt and Vince Beagle to the 
NFL, the Badgers still return 
a plethora of talent on their 
defensive front.

Couple that with a true 3-4 

scheme rarely seen consistently 
on the college level — one that 
Kugler said is “different than 
what we played all year” — and 
the Wolverines will have their 

hands full.

The formation functions so 

well, in large part, because of 
nose guard Olive Sagapolu. 
Kugler 
called 
him 
“a 
big 

boy,” and even that may be 
underselling it. At 6-foot-2 and 
346 pounds, Sagapolu could 
prove to be a major test for 
the Wolverines’ 
offensive line.

Kugler 
and 

his 
unit 
are 

relishing 
that 

challenge.

“It’s exciting,” 

Kugler 
said. 

“Everyone 
always 
talks 
about 

Wisconsin’s 
O-line and how 
they’re always one of the best 
in the country, and we’re trying 
to throw our name in there too. 
I think we’re very capable and 
it’s gonna be a great battle on 
Saturday.

“They’re 
a 
very 
physical 

front on defense as well. And so 

it’s gonna be a great challenge 
for us, but it’s more exciting 
than anything.”

WHERE’S 
THE 
CALL?: 

Maryland 
didn’t 
make 

freshman 
wide 
receiver 

Donovan 
Peoples-Jones’ 
life 

easy.

On the Wolverines’ first drive 

of 
the 
game, 

Peoples-Jones 
was 
targeted 

on 
1st-and-10 

from Michigan’s 
41-yard 
line. 

He wasn’t able 
to reel in what 
would have been 
a 
first-down 

reception, 
but 

was 
animated 

after the play, 

pleading for a pass interference 
call after seemingly having his 
jersey pulled.

Jim 
Harbaugh 
took 

exception to the no-call as well, 
expressing 
his 
frustrations 

to the referee on the sideline. 
And on Monday, Harbaugh 

articulated his dissatisfaction.

“There was one of those. 

There was another one where 
the DB had his hand on the back 
of his jersey, horse collared 
him and (he) wasn’t able to go 
catch the ball and make a play,” 
Harbaugh said. “I don’t know 
what to tell him at that point. 
... 
Lift 
more 

weights so they 
don’t grab you 
and horse collar 
you from making 
a catch?”

As for Perry, 

he did find one 
silver 
lining 

to 
Saturday’s 

events.

“That’s 

respect because, 
you know, if they can’t guard 
you without holding you, that 
says 
something,” 
he 
said. 

“He’s gonna learn how to 
fight through that, and we’re 
definitely gonna work on that 
this week. It’s gonna be a tough, 
physical game in Madison, and 

we’re gonna be ready for it.”

RUIZ 
GETS 
THE 
NOD 

AGAIN: Cesar Ruiz got the 
first start of his career against 
Minnesota. He didn’t have to 
wait long for his second.

The freshman right guard got 

the starting nod again against 
the Terrapins, and continued to 

impress.

“I found out a 

lot of good things 
about 
Cesar,” 

Harbaugh 
said. “I’m very 
happy with the 
job 
he’s 
done. 

He’s 
acquitted 

himself 
very 

well.”

Ruiz’s second 

start 
was, 

once again, the byproduct of 
an injury Michael Onwenu 
sustained 
against 
Rutgers. 

Though Onwenu was dressed 
for 
the 
matchup 
against 

Maryland, 
Harbaugh 
said 

the sophomore wasn’t “100 
percent.”

Harbaugh added that the 

rest was beneficial and that 
he anticipates Onwenu will 
be back this week. As for who 
will start against Wisconsin 
when Onwenu does return, 
Harbaugh cited that, as always, 
the Wolverines function as a 
meritocracy.

Either 
way, 
Ruiz’s 

performances to this point 
haven’t gone unnoticed.

“We knew since day one 

(when) he got here that he 
was a great talent,” Kugler 
said. “Sooner or later he was 
gonna get his opportunity, and 
we knew he was gonna take 
advantage of it when he did. 
He’s been doing a great job at 
right guard.”

INJURIES: 
Michigan 

continues to work through a 
slew of injuries, and Harbaugh 
provided 
updates 
on 
them 

Monday afternoon.

Lavert Hill exited Saturday’s 

game, and Harbaugh said that 
the 
sophomore 
cornerback 

is 
currently 
going 
through 

concussion protocol — though 
he did not indicate whether 
or not Hill will be available 
against the Badgers.

Ty 
Isaac, 
on 
the 
other 

hand, did not make the trip to 
College Park. Harbaugh said he 
received “positive news” on the 
fifth-year senior running back, 
and that he would know more 
as the week moves on.

The big question, of course, 

is the status of redshirt junior 
quarterback Wilton Speight. It 
appears not much has changed 
since last week, when Harbaugh 
said that Speight was cleared 
to throw but not for contact 
activity.

“(Freshman tight end Nick 

Eubanks) 
and 
Wilton 
will 

be in the same category this 
week,” Harbaugh said. “They’ll 
practice, they’ll be in a red 
jersey, they won’t have contact. 
I don’t know if either one will 
be cleared by the time we get 
to the game on Saturday, but 
they’ll be reintroduced back 
into practice per the doctor’s 
clearance for being able to 
practice but not being able to 
have contact.”

Abdur-Rahkman leads Michigan to win, 
despite another uneven performance

Saturday against North Florida, 

Muhammad-Ali Abdur-Rahkman 
took one shot in the first half.

The senior guard did not make 

that 
mistake 
again 
Monday, 

grabbing a stranglehold of the 
Michigan men’s basketball team’s 
struggling offense the way a 
captain should.

He led the team in minutes with 

37, shots with 15 and points with 17, 
guiding the Wolverines to a 72-65 
win over Central Michigan.

“His 
aggressiveness 
really 

set a tone,” said fifth-year senior 
forward Duncan Robinson. “His 
ability to get to the basket and also 
score from the outside is fantastic 
for us. We really feel like we’re 
at our best when he’s aggressive. 
Hopefully, we’ll see more of that 
moving forward.”

But the outcome, as was the 

case Saturday, remained in doubt 
well into the second half.

The Chippewas came out eager 

to shoot threes, and at least early 
in the game, were making them. 
They made five of their first 10 
attempts from beyond the arc and 
grabbed an eight-point lead with 
7:36 left in the half.

On the other side of the court, 

Michigan 
showed 
a 
familiar 

dysfunction.

Though offensive stagnation 

was reminiscent of the Wolverines’ 
season-opening performance, the 
nature of their struggles was quite 
different. The Chippewas’ frenetic 
defense — a soft full-court pressure 
that broke down into a frantic 
matchup zone — wreaked havoc 
early, and Michigan looked out of 
sorts from the opening tip. At the 
first media timeout, the Wolverines 
were 1-for-6 with three turnovers, 
and trailed an energized Central 
Michigan team, 8-3.

But the shots wouldn’t fall 

forever for the Chippewas, and 
slowly but surely, Michigan’s 
offense began to find its footing. 

After combining for just four 

points in the first half against 
North Florida, Abdur-Rahkman 
and 
junior 
forward 
Moritz 

Wagner took ownership of the 
offense Monday, combining for 12 
of the team’s 26 first-half shots and 
16 of the team’s 32 points.

A corner 3-pointer from Abdur-

Rahkman sent the Wolverines into 
the half on a 12-3 run with a 32-31 
lead in hand. His personal 8-0 
run — with halftime sandwiched 
in between — gave Michigan the 
lead. 

He couldn’t do it alone, though. 

His backcourt mate, sophomore 
Zavier Simpson, staked the most 
defiant claim yet to make that 
starting spot permanent. Coupled 
with his usual defensive tenacity, 
Simpson posted his best offensive 
performance as a Wolverine, 
making five of his seven shots and 
scoring a career-high 13 points.

The 
Chippewas 
weathered 

that blow early in the second 
half, though, to grab a 47-46 lead 
on a layup from guard Shawn 

Roundtree. 
He 
led 
Central 

Michigan with 19 points, and 
speaheaded 
the 
up-tempo 

Chippewa offense.

“We had Roundtree (before the 

game) as a, what we call ‘Two-gap’ 
— a good shooter, but not a great 
shooter,” said Michigan coach 
John Beilein.“His points were a 
big difference in this game. He was 
really good.”

But the effort was not quite 

enough to pull off the upset.

With the Wolverines clinging 

to a three-point lead with 6:49 to 
go, it was Abdur-Rahkman who 
took initiative. With the shot 
clock running down, he found 
himself trapped near the baseline. 
Effortlessly, the senior pivoted out 
of duress toward the hoop, and 
made an underhand shot in the 
lane. 

He then raced down toward the 

other end and stole a pass headed 
for a driving Chippewa, hurdling 
his way over photographers in the 
process.

“I just love what he’s bringing 

us right now with defense,” Beilein 
said. “We talked about — ‘Are 
you going to be a thermometer 
or the thermostat? Are you going 
to be the one who reads the 
temperature or are you going to set 
the temperature?’

“…‘Set the temperature today. 

Go out there and you gotta show 
everybody how hard we’ve got to 
play, because if you’re just playing 
and you don’t have that extra 
bit right there, everybody will 
probably follow that.’

“I just thought it was really a 

great play from him, and one that 
really helped us win the game.”

From there, Michigan began 

to pull away, eking out another 
uneven victory, 72-65, and a 2-0 
start to the season. It’s another 
bumpy perfomance, but, according 
to Beilein, it is all part of a longer 
process.

“I have some confidence the 

sun’s going to rise tomorrow, and 
we’re going to get better,” he said. 
“I’m just saying it’s going to be a 
journey.”

John Beilein said he wished 

Zavier Simpson would “look at 
the basket” more after Michigan’s 
season opener on Saturday. 

It was a plea for the sophomore 

guard to be more aggressive 
offensively — to make plays and 
take his shots when they’re there.

Monday, 
against 
Central 

Michigan, Simpson heeded his 
coach’s advice.

In a game where the Wolverines 

couldn’t find their offensive touch 
— especially from 3-point range, 
where they shot 29 percent — the 
Chippewas were able to hang 
around. With just 3:32 left in the 
game, a shot from forward David 
DiLeo pulled Central Michigan 
within seven points. Michigan 
needed a spark from somewhere to 
push it over the edge.

The 
Chippewas 
entered 
a 

hawkish, 
full-court 
press 
— 

different from the more relaxed 
full-court 
defense 
they 
had 

employed all game. The Wolverines 
didn’t panic, though, breaking the 
press with ease. Simpson ended 
up with the ball in the frontcourt. 
He lobbed it over the outstretched 
hands of the last Central Michigan 
defender and gently toward the 
hoop where junior forward Moritz 
Wagner slammed it home.

Moments 
later, 
after 
the 

Chippewas 
answered 
with 
a 

3-pointer, fifth-year senior forward 
Duncan Robinson drove into the 
lane and kicked the ball out to a 
wide-open Simpson at the top of the 
key. And on a day when scorers like 
Robinson and Wagner struggled to 
find their stroke, Simpson didn’t.

The shot was a high point of a 

5-for-7 shooting performance that 
netted him 13 points. While Beilein 
believes there’s more work to be 
done, he saw the performance as 
an sign of improvement for his 
point guard.

“That’s what he has to do. He 

can’t be a swinging gate out top,” 
Beilein said. “We’ve got to get 
closer. If you watch him and Jaaron 
(Simmons), 
sometimes 
they’re 

standing on the block ‘M’ reversing 
the ball (and) we’re playing four on 
five. That’s a spatial thing we’ve 
just got to keep working on. … 
That’s what he has to do.”

In addition to his improved 

shooting, Simpson continued to 
do the things that put him in the 
starting lineup in the first place.

Defensively, he added two steals 

to his stat sheet, and on a number 
of different occasions, he forced 
bad shots or jump balls.

And after having only one 

turnover against North Florida, 
Simpson had none against the 
Chippewas. 
While 
his 
assist 

numbers did drop from nine 
to three in the two games, the 
sophomore noted that taking 
care of the ball is a main focus 
for him. It’s something he credits 
assistant coach Deandre Haynes 
for instilling in him.

“It’s definitely a more concerted 

effort to take care of the ball,” 
Simpson said. “It’s important as 
a team. We try to limit ourselves 
to no more than 10 turnovers 
a game. With assistant coach 
— coach Deandre — he’s on me 
about turnovers, whether that’s in 
practice or the game.

“… For a starting point guard, 

it’s just important that I take care 
of the ball.”

Beilein has said recently that he’s 

eventually hoping to cut the three-
man rotation at point guard to two. 
It was already a fairly safe bet that 
Simpson would stay in that rotation. 
It’s less of a sure thing, though, 
whether he’ll maintain his starting 
role once fifth-year senior guard 
Jaaron Simmons gets acclimated.

But if Simpson can continue 

to improve his aggressiveness 
offensively, 
while 
maintaining 

his defensive and ball-protecting 
capabilities, he’ll make it hard for 
Beilein to bench him.
