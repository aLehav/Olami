Councilmember 

proposes resolution 
to facilitate dialogue 
on homeless camps

By EMMA KERR

Daily News Editor

Councilmember Stephen Kun-

selman (D–Ward 3) announced 
Wednesday night that he intends 
to challenge the recent effort to 
recall him from Ann Arbor City 
Council by addressing the issue of 
homeless camps in Ann Arbor at 
Tuesday’s Council meeting.

Kunselman has come under 

fire from various members and 
allies of the homeless community 
in Ann Arbor following state-
ments some individuals of that 
community considered insensi-
tive and threatening. The recall 
petitions specifically cite Kunsel-
man’s July comments on the city’s 
controversial decision to bulldoze 
a homeless camp.

These types of camps do not 

meet current zoning ordinances 
in the city of Ann Arbor nor do 
they adhere to Michigan resi-
dential building codes, meaning 
camps like the one in question 
cannot legally remain in use.

The Washtenaw County Elec-

tion Committee decided on Jan. 5 
to consider four submitted recall 
petitions both factual and clear, 
clearing the way for the petitions 
to appear on a ballot if they get 
2,000 signatures from Ann Arbor 
voters by May. Kunselman is also 
up for reelection in November. A 
successful recall petition would 
remove him from office several 
months earlier than his term con-
cludes.

In a press release, Kunselman 

said he will not appeal the deci-
sion to confirm the language of 
these petitions in court, but rath-
er that he plans to eliminate what 
he believes is misinformation by 
placing a resolution on City Coun-
cil’s agenda. The “Resolution 
Supporting the Establishment 

Faculty, students

experiences, ideas

At an open speak-out Wednes-

day night, members of the Univer-
sity community participated in an 
intimate dialogue in the Michigan 
Union’s Rogel Ballroom on police 
brutality and recent events in Fer-

guson, Mo., and Staten Island, N.Y.

The discussion — sponsored 

by Central Student Government 
in collaboration with Counsel-
ing and Psychological Services, 
the Black Student Union and the 
Students of Color of Rackham — 
derived from a November CSG 
resolution pledging to stand in 
solidarity with the people of Fer-
guson. In August, unarmed Black 
teenager Michael Brown was shot 
and killed by a Ferguson police 
officer, sparking a national dia-
logue on race and police brutality.

A clause of the resolution stated 

CSG would plan a forum to dis-
cuss police brutality with the Uni-
versity community.

The event included no formal 

speakers and was open to any-
one in the University community. 
Those in attendance were first 
asked to reflect on their own expe-
riences with policing at the Uni-
versity and offer their thoughts 
and perspectives about the quality 
of policing on campus.

BSU speaker Arnold Reed, an 

LSA senior, shared a story of how 
he and his and fraternity brothers 
were surrounded by police one 

night while practicing their step 
routine for the October 2014 Mid-
night Madness performance.

“Walking away from that situa-

tion I felt very confused, attacked 
and unsafe,” Reed said. “Had that 
been a different group of guys, 
who knows what would’ve hap-
pened?”

BSU secretary Cap Kendall, a 

Kinesiology junior, discussed how 
her negative experiences with 
campus police have emotionally 
impacted her.

“It’s to the point where I don’t

Entrepreneurially minded Uni-

versity students are preparing 
to compete for a new title: “The 
Startup.”

Organized by the University’s 

Center for Entrepreneurship and 
modeled after NBC’s reality show 
“The Voice,” the program, in its 
first year, encourages students to 
share their business ideas in an 
environment designed to simu-
late the real-world stakes faced by 
entrepreneurs.

Similar to what contestants 

endure on “The Voice,” selected 
applicants will participate in a 
casting call, where they will pres-
ent their business proposal and 
describe what “The Startup” can 
do for their personal and profes-
sional development.

Taylor talks 

continued positive 
interactions with 
President Schlissel

By ANASTASSIOS 
ADAMOPOULUS

Daily Staff Reporter 

Mayor Christopher Taylor 

(D) has been in office for two 
months — and a great deal has 
happened.

Under Taylor’s purview, the 

city has adopted a resolution 
calling for Ann Arbor police 
officers to wear body cameras, 
inaugurated a new fire chief and 
approved the construction of a 
new parking structure.

And the mayor has met with 

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel twice since coming to 
office — one of these meetings 
was during Taylor’s first day on 
the job.

Taylor, a University alum, has 

previously stressed the impor-
tance of a strong relationship 
between the city and the Uni-

versity.

He said he expects to meet 

with Schlissel periodically and 
looks forward to continued 
communication with the Uni-
versity, which he added indi-
cates a “mutual commitment” 
to the Ann Arbor community.

“We are long term players,” 

Taylor said in an interview with 
The Michigan Daily. “It is in 
the University’s best interest 
to have a city that works (and) 
have a successful Ann Arbor, 
and it is in Ann Arbor’s interest 
to have the University continue 
to be a global leader in higher 
education.”

Taylor has played a role in 

facilitating several initiatives in 
his first two months as mayor, 
such as beginning snow remov-
al earlier than usual this year to 
preempt weather-related traffic 
issues.

He also noted that City Coun-

cil is trying to make local hous-
ing more affordable and is using 
a Homeless Needs Assessment 
report to direct these efforts. 
The initiative comes after the 
council approved in December

Former DHS 

secretary discusses 
negative perception

Daily Staff Reporter 

The Ford School of Pub-

lic Policy hosted University 
of California President Janet 

Napolitano, former secretary of 
Homeland Security under Pres-
ident Barack Obama, for a lec-
ture and question and answer 
session on public service and 
politics Wednesday.

Napolitano, who also served 

as Arizona’s governor from 
2003 to 2009, spoke to an audi-
ence of almost 300 at the Power 
Center on a number of issues 
including public higher edu-
cation institutions, negative 
perceptions of politics and her 
experiences serving in various 

posts.

Napolitano urged the crowd 

to change their views on the 
role of politics, which she said 
has turned negative across 
the country, and to strive to 
become leaders and improve 
what they see as problematic 
with the current leadership.

“When practicing politics 

is perceived as a lesser, not 
greater form of public service, 
practicing 
politics 
becomes 

unattractive to those who like

Scientists find 
microbes and 

invasive species on 

boats

TRAVERSE 
CITY, 
Mich. 

(AP) — Government-sanctioned 
tests of equipment designed to 
cleanse ship ballast water of 
invasive species are seriously 
flawed because they don’t deter-
mine whether the systems will 
remove microbes that cause 
gastrointestinal illnesses, scien-
tists said Wednesday.

Ballast water provides sta-

bility for cargo ships in rough 
seas. But it’s believed to have 
introduced numerous invaders 
to U.S. coastal waters and the 
Great Lakes, including zebra 
mussels, spotted jellyfish and 
Japanese shore crabs, along 
with bacteria and viruses.

The Environmental Protec-

tion Agency and the Coast Guard 
have set limits on the number 
of live organisms ballast water 
can contain, based on standards 
proposed by an international 
agency in 2004. To comply, ship 
companies must install technol-
ogy that kills enough creatures 
to meet the limits.

Laboratory testing of treat-

ment systems has been con-
ducted for 10 years. But a newly 
published paper in the Marine 
Pollution 
Bulletin 
contends 

the evaluations have a crucial 
defect: They don’t adequately 
measure the systems’ effec-
tiveness against three disease-
carrying microbes that the 
regulations target. One of them, 
E. coli, can indicate the pres-
ence of fecal sewage.

“This is a real problem,” said 

Andrew Cohen of the Center for 
Research on Aquatic Bioinva-
sions in Richmond, California, 
who wrote the paper with Fred 
Dobbs of Old Dominion Univer-

sity in Virginia. “We know there 
are serious pathogens in ballast 
water. There’s good evidence 
that ballast water has moved 
them around the world and into 
U.S. waters.”

The Coast Guard declined to 

comment and EPA had no imme-
diate reaction to the report.

Some experts believe bal-

last water from Asia caused a 
1991 cholera outbreak in South 
America that killed 10,000 peo-
ple, Cohen said. According to 
the paper, at least 38 species of 
disease-causing bacteria have 
been detected in ballast tanks.

Companies 
are 
develop-

ing on-board cleansing sys-
tems using tools such as filters, 
chemicals, ozone and ultravio-
let light. University and private 
laboratories are testing how 
well they work. Fifty-three sys-
tems have won approval from at 
least one country with member-
ship in the International Mari-
time Organization.

The U.S. Coast Guard and 

EPA have yet to certify any sys-
tem but have allowed the tem-
porary use of 45 endorsed by 
other nations.

Cohen and Dobbs said they 

obtained data from 390 tests 
conducted on 38 treatment sys-
tems between 2004 and 2013. 
They said in 95 percent of the 
tests, the water samples con-
tained so few of the targeted 
microbes from the start that 
they met the standards even 
before the treatments began.

“The equipment being tested 

would have passed the microbe 
tests even if it hadn’t been 
turned on,” Cohen said. “You 
need to begin with at least 
enough microbes in the water so 
that if the system is turned off, 
the (sample) will fail.”

The 
process 
should 
be 

improved and all tests con-
ducted thus far redone using 
water containing microbial lev-
els “comparable to what ships 
would encounter in a bad situ-
ation out in the real world,” he 
said.

Two men finish 

their free climb of 

Dawn Wall

YOSEMITE 
NATIONAL 

PARK, Calif. (AP) — A pair 
of Americans on Wednesday 
completed what had long been 
considered the world’s most 
difficult rock climb, using only 
their hands and feet to conquer 
a 3,000-foot vertical wall on El 
Capitan, the forbidding granite 
pedestal in Yosemite National 
Park that has beckoned adven-
turers for more than half a cen-
tury.

Tommy Caldwell and Kevin 

Jorgeson became the first to 
“free-climb” the rock forma-
tion’s Dawn Wall, a feat that 
many had considered impossi-
ble. They used ropes and safety 
harnesses to catch them in case 
of a fall, but relied entirely on 
their own strength and dexter-
ity to ascend by grasping cracks 
as thin as razor blades and as 
small as dimes.

The effort took weeks, as the 

two dealt with constant falls 
and injuries. But their success 
completes a years-long dream 

that bordered on obsession for 
the men.

The trek up the world’s larg-

est granite monolith began 
Dec. 27. Caldwell and Jorgeson 
lived on the wall itself. They 
ate and slept in tents fastened 
to the rock thousands of feet 
above the ground and battled 
painful cuts to their fingertips 
much of the way.

Free-climbers do not pull 

themselves up with cables or 
use chisels to carve out hand-
holds. Instead, they climb inch 
by inch, wedging their finger-
tips and feet into tiny crevices 
or gripping sharp, thin projec-
tions of rock. In photographs, 
the two appeared at times like 
Spider-Man, with arms and 
legs splayed across the pale 
rock that has been described as 
smooth as a bedroom wall.

Both men needed to take rest 

days to wait for their skin to 
heal. They used tape and even 
superglue to help with the pro-
cess. At one point, Caldwell set 
an alarm to wake him every 
few hours to apply a special 
lotion to his throbbing hands.

They also took physical pun-

ishment when their grip would 
slip, pitching them into long, 

swinging falls that left them 
bouncing off the rock face. The 
tumbles, which they called 
“taking a whipper,” ended in 
startling jolts from their safety 
ropes.

Caldwell and Jorgeson had 

help from a team of supporters 
who brought food and supplies 
and shot video of the adven-
ture.

The 36-year-old Caldwell 

and 30-year-old Jorgeson ate 
canned 
peaches 
and 
occa-

sionally sipped whiskey. They 
watched their urine evaporate 
into thin, dry air and handed 
toilet sacks, called “wag bags,” 
to helpers who disposed of 
them.

There are about 100 routes 

up the rock known among 
climbers as “El Cap,” and many 
have made it to the top, the 
first in 1958. Even the Dawn 
Wall had been scaled. Warren 
Harding and Dean Caldwell 
(no relation to Tommy) made 
it up in 1970, using climbing 
ropes and countless rivets over 
27 days.

No one, however, had ever 

made it to the 3,000-foot sum-
mit in one continuous free-
climb — until now.

pete in a first round to secure a 
spot on one of the competition’s four 
mentor-led teams. As on “The Voice,” 
the mentors select students for their 
team who they believe have the 
most potential.

During three additional rounds, 

teams and mentors work closely 
to prepare for the next challenge 
and to advance their team’s pro-
posal. Attendees at “Entrepreneur-
ship Hour,” an event held through 
the CFE every Friday, will vote to 
eliminate a team after every round. 
The final remaining team will be 
crowned “The Startup.”

Sarah Bachleda, communication 

and marketing maven for the CFE, 

said in addition to working closely 
with team mentors, students will 
also gain increased operating capi-
tal as they make it past each round. 
She added that the winning team 
will not only win the title “The 
Startup,” but also earn a grand prize 
to continue building their business.

“The rounds will take place live 

in front of our Entrepreneurship 
Hour students, giving these teams 
a ton of visibility as well,” she said. 
“It will take place semester-long, 
providing an engaging structure 
and space to truly advance the 
startups.”

Amy Cell, vice president of the 

Michigan 
Economic 
Develop-

ment Corporation, will serve as a 
team mentor for the competition. 
Cell said “The Startup” is a great 
opportunity to explore a business 

idea in a fun, accelerated way.

“I’ve been involved with CFE 

since the beginning, and I’m con-
tinually amazed with the energy, 
creativity and passion of the pro-
grams that they put together,” 
Cell said. “As an economic devel-
oper for the state of Michigan, I 
understand the critical impor-
tance of innovation and entrepre-
neurship.”

Cell said the program will not 

only serve as a learning experi-
ence for students, but also for the 
mentors involved.

“I hope to find people that I 

can follow and support for years 
to come,” she said. “I also hope to 
find startups that can start having 
a near-term impact on Michigan.”

Applications to participate in 

the program are due Friday.

of Homeless Camps in Ann 
Arbor” is intended primarily to 
allow for debate on the matter, 
as opposed to propose a specif-
ic action of the Council.

Kunselman stated he intends 

to vote against this resolution.

In the release, Kunselman 

also said various volunteers 
and city officials have ensured 
there is enough funding and 
capacity for every homeless 
person, making camps that 
pose the threat of hypothermia 
obsolete.

“My position on homeless 

camps is no different than 
that of Mayor Mike Duggan 
of Detroit, who just last week 
successfully led the effort to 
dismantle a homeless camp 
and find safe and legal shelter 
for all the homeless involved, 
all of whom were very grateful 
to have warm shelter,” Kunsel-
man said. “Homeless camps 
are 
dangerous, 
unsanitary, 

illegal and unnecessary given 
the high quality of homeless 
services available to the home-
less to live safely and legally in 
Ann Arbor.”

In an interview Wednesday 

evening, Councilmember Sabra 
Briere (D–Ward 1) said while 
she has not reviewed the reso-
lution proposed by Kunselman, 
her initial reaction was one 
of concern as to whether this 
discussion would be helpful in 
solving problems of affordable 
housing in Ann Arbor.

“While I understand that 

he is annoyed, I am sorry he 
thinks doing this is a solution 
to anything,” Briere said. “I 
don’t think it moves us toward 
finding a solution to the need 
for affordable housing, but I 
haven’t seen the resolution yet 
and I have no idea where things 
will head, I have no opinion 
right now about whether I will 
support this.”

Wednesday evening, Coun-

cilmember Julie Grand (D–
Ward 3) said she would like to 
see more constructive solu-

tions 
to 
the 
disagreement 

between Kunselman and the 
housing group.

“Councilmember 
Kun-

selman is going to be up for 
reelection in August, so if 
there’s a group that’s not sat-
isfied with his performance, 
then they have every right to 
run a candidate in the August 
primaries or in the November 
general election,” Grand said. 
“I think that’s a more effec-
tive way to address the issue 
certainly than with a recall. 
Ultimately, the most effective 
way to address the issue is to 
work for issues that address 
our housing and homelessness 
situation. There’s not a magic 
bullet, but if there was we cer-
tainly would have implement-
ed it already.”

Mayor 
Christopher 
Tay-

lor (D) declined to comment 
Wednesday evening.

WINDSOR TOWNSHIP, Mich.
State police move 
headquarters from 
Lansing to suburb

Michigan State Police head-

quarters is leaving Lansing for the 
suburbs and taking 400 jobs with 
it.

State police director Col. Kriste 

Kibbey Etue said Wednesday that 
the move will start in September 
and take two years.

She says the new headquar-

ters will be in the State Second-
ary Complex in Eaton County’s 
Windsor Township, southwest of 
Lansing.

Caleb Buhs is a spokesman 

for the Michigan Department of 
Technology, Management & Bud-
get and says the move is part of 
a shuffling of state agencies that 
is expected to save the state $30 
million over 10 years.

Buhs tells the Lansing State 

Journal 
that 
the 
Michigan 

Department 
of 
Community 

Health will move into the current 
state police headquarters.

CORONADO, Calif.
Michigan RNC 
representative 
censured by panel

The 
Republican 
National 

Committee’s executive commit-
tee voted to censure Michigan 
Republican David Agema for 
what it calls “harmful rhetoric” 
about gays and Muslims.

At the outset of the RNC’s win-

ter meeting near San Diego, the 
panel said Michigan Republican 
National Committeeman Dave 
Agema’s history of “harmful and 
offensive rhetoric” has no place in 
the party.

Last March, Agema posted 

on Facebook an unsubstantiated 
claim that gays account for half 
the murders in large cities. Last 
month, he told a Michigan county 
GOP committee that gay Ameri-
cans tried to obtain health insur-
ance because they risk contracting 
AIDS.

Agema also came under fire 

from the Council on American-
Islamic Relations for a Facebook 
posting this month questioning 
Muslims’ commitment to char-
ity.

BUCYRUS, Ohio
Man pleads guilty 
to killing four 
while on cocaine

A man on a cocaine binge 

fatally beat or strangled four 
others at their homes — in one 
case, using his own shoestrings 
— then walked into the police 
station to confess after recog-
nizing one victim’s relatives in 
a newspaper photo, a prosecutor 
said Wednesday after the defen-
dant was sentenced to life in 
prison without parole.

Donald Hoffman apparently 

was high and looking to steal 
money for more drugs when he 
killed the men last fall in the 
small, north-central Ohio city of 
Bucyrus, Crawford County Pros-
ecutor Matthew Crall said. Hoff-
man used whatever means were 
available, stomping on one man’s 
throat and striking another with 
a bottle, Crall said.

FREETOWN, Sierra Leone
Hopeful president 
predicts no new 
cases of Ebola

Even as his country regis-

tered 19 new Ebola cases over a 
24-hour period, Sierra Leone’s 
president is predicting there will 
be zero new confirmed cases by 
the end of March.

President Ernest Bai Koroma 

also predicted that his West Afri-
can country — one of three hard-
est hit by the outbreak — would 
be Ebola-free by World Health 
Organization standards by May. 
Koroma made this pronounce-
ment during town hall meetings

 Daily wire reports

the expansion of services for 
the homeless who frequent the 
Ann Arbor District Library.

During his campaign, Taylor 

said one of his priorities was 
to expand public transporta-
tion such as the Ann Arbor 
Area Transportation Author-
ity. He said the city is currently 
examining potential sites for a 
new train station, which could 
include the renovation of a 
pre-existing Amtrak station at 

Depot Street.

However, the project would 

likely involve the purchase of 
adjacent property from DTE 
Energy. The city is waiting on 
environmental impact reports 
for other potential sites before 
moving forward.

Another initiative in the 

works is fixing Ann Arbor’s 
roads. In September, Washt-
enaw County voters approved 
a 0.5-mill tax to provide for 
improvements to existing roads 
and infrastructure. Taylor said 
he expects the next year to 
include several construction 
projects to fix roads in the area. 

He added that the millage will 
yield repairs on 6.4 miles of 
roads.

So far, Taylor said his larg-

est challenge has been deal-
ing with the repercussions of a 
November 2014 police shooting, 
in which a 40-year-old woman 
was fatally shot by an Ann 
Arbor police officer.

“The shooting obviously took 

place in the context of an impor-
tant and justifiable national con-
versation and so dealing with 
that in the city has been probably 
my most challenging area,” he 
said.

Taylor noted that the Michi-

gan State Police have been con-
ducting an investigation in the 
case. Ultimately, findings from 
the investigation will be given to 
the Washtenaw County Prosecu-
tor’s Office, who will then decide 
whether or not to indict the offi-
cer in question.

“It’s very important for us to 

reflect from what happened 
once we have the full and final 
facts and to make sure we can 
do everything we can to protect 
public safety,” he said. “Our 
officers … I think do a great job 
at that. They are a professional 
and dedicated police depart-
ment.”

In response to the pending 

case, and other similar inci-
dents nationwide, City Council 
passed a resolution in Decem-
ber to implement the use of 
body and in-car cameras for the 
Ann Arbor police officers.

Taylor said outfitting offi-

cers with body cameras had 
been in the works for months 
prior to the shooting.

He also said he is now focused 

on 
preparing 
Ann 
Arbor’s 

upcoming budget proposal, set 
for release in April, which will 
play a significant role in shap-
ing the city’s agenda.

many of you here seek to engage 
in public policy for the public 
good,” Napolitano told the audi-
ence.

She attributed this problem 

to political partisanship, the 
media’s focus on negativity, 
potential candidates’ concerns 
about intrusions into their pri-
vate lives and lack of commu-
nication about the importance 
of politics. She added, however, 
that this should not mean that 
people exclude themselves from 
political life.

In an interview with The 

Michigan Daily after the event, 
Napolitano expanded on that 
idea adding if individuals want 
to affect change, running for 
office is the direct way.

“Don’t get me wrong, it’s great 

to be a civil servant, a policy 
adviser,” she said. “Those are all 
wonderful things. But the way 
our government is organized, it’s 
the elected official who makes 

the decision. So if you want that, 
then at some point you need to 
do it yourself.”

She also touched specifically 

on female leadership, telling the 
attendees that though women 
have proven that they can suc-
cessfully run for office without 
help from men and party boss-
es, they often still choose not 
to run for elected office.

More generally, she said 

politics must become a more 
attractive engagement for citi-
zens.

“We 
need 
to 
reset 
and 

reboot how we view political 
leadership in this country and 
enlarge the pool of talented 
individuals who are willing to 
engage in elected politics,” she 
said.

Napolitano 
also 
fielded 

several questions after the 
speech about her time in 
office, including her knowl-
edge of the National Security 
Agency wiretapping programs. 
Though she declined to discuss 
the level of intelligence she to 
which she had access, she did 
say both the president and the 

Senate, who have oversight 
responsibility of the NSA, need 
to have greater oversight of the 
intelligence gathering process.

However, she acknowledged 

that she does not know if the 
situation has changed since 
her departure from the Obama 
Administration.

In the interview, Napoli-

tano also discussed what pub-
lic universities can do to cope 
with reduced state funding, a 
prevalent issue in both Michi-
gan and California. The UC 
system recently proposed rais-
ing tuition by 5 percent yearly 
to cope with reduced funding.

She noted that universities 

can reduce costs internally 
and discussed UC’s Working 
Smarter initiative that aimed 
to reduce costs within univer-
sities.

“We have identified $660 

million in costs,” Napolitano 
said. “We didn’t replace certain 
people who were in manage-
ment or administration when 
they retired. So we actually 
have fewer senior managers 
now than we did in 2007, 2008. 

And we really worked to bring 
down administrative overhead 
on students, so all those things 
go together.”

Napolitano 
addedthat 

decreased state funding and 
efforts to persuade the state 
to reinvest in higher education 
has been her biggest challenge 
since becoming UC president. 
She said she intends to use her 
bully pulpit both in California 
and Washington D.C. to sup-
port the role of public higher 
education as means for creat-
ing opportunity for students.

In 
Michigan, 
Republican 

Gov. Rick Snyder enacted cuts 
to higher education in the 
first years of his term. Though 
recent budgets have included 
funding increases for higher 
education, the funding has not 
been restored to its former lev-
els. In June, the University’s 
Board of Regents enacted a 1.6 
percent tuition increase for in-
state students and 3.4 percent 
for out-of-state students.

State investment, she said, 

is key for schools especially 
for increasing a student body’s 

socioeconomic diversity. She 
said universities both need 
build pipelines between high 
schools in poor areas and pub-
lic universities and establish 
robust financial aid policies, 
adding that schools need to be 
conscious of the burden that 
tuition increases cause for 
middle-class students.

She cited the UC system as 

an example — where students 
with 
families 
making 
less 

than $80,000 annually receive 
free tuition — though she said 
tuition increases remain a con-
cern, particularly for middle-
class students who just miss 
the threshold.

“(The policies) are an engine 

of social mobility,” she said. 
“We want to keep that up. But 
we can’t provide (students) 
with the quality of education 
that their predecessors got, 
and do that, without some more 
money getting into the system. 
And the more money either has 
to come from the state or needs 
to come from tuition, from 
those who are paying tuition.”

even want to reproduce and bear 
children,” she said. “I don’t want 
my children to feel the terrible 
feelings I feel being Black every 
day.”

Participants also discussed 

the relevance of the incidents 
in Staten Island and Ferguson, 
where grand juries chose not to 
indict officers who had killed 
unarmed Black men.

University faculty and staff 

were also present to share their 
experiences and thoughts on 
police brutality. One faculty 
member shared a story of how 
her Black colleague, a doctor-

al student, was often stopped 
by police when riding his bike 
around campus.

A portion of the discussion 

was also dedicated to brain-
storming ways in which stu-
dents, faculty and University 
police can work to create a posi-
tive and safe environment on 
campus. Ideas discussed includ-
ed ensuring University crime 
reports are more specific and 
encouraging University Police 
becoming involved with the 
#BlackLivesMatter 
campaign 

and other events on campus.

In recent months, members 

of the University and Ann Arbor 
community organized several 
events to call attention to police 
brutality, including “die-ins” 

on the Diag and in front of the 
Crisler Center following Winter 
Commencement.

University Police Chief Rob-

ert Neumann was also present 
at the event. Though he did not 
participate in the discussion, he 
took notes as students offered 
ideas to improve the quality of 
policing on campus. In an inter-
view with The Michigan Daily, 
Neumann said having the dis-
cussion was essential in devel-
oping a positive relationship 
between the police and commu-
nity.

“It’s critical that the com-

munity and the police have an 
open and trusting and trans-
parent relationship,” he said. 
“The police are here for the 

community, we have to always 
to remember that. Good police 
administration seeks out input 
from the community.”

Neumann also said working 

to improve public safety on cam-
pus is a process that will require 
continued support and coopera-
tion from the campus commu-
nity.

“We will never rest on what 

we’ve done in the past, in terms 
of community outreach,” he 
said. “We are always looking for 
news way to engage our com-
munity, because our community 
is evolving and we must evolve 
with it.”

LSA senior Geralyn Gaines, 

BSU vice speaker and a CSG 
representative, helped plan the 

event. She said hosting the dis-
cussion was vital to sparking 
more of a reaction from the Uni-
versity community to nationally 
recognized instances of police 
brutality and bringing attention 
to the issue as a whole.

“As a student body, I don’t 

feel we have had enough of a 
response in regards to what’s 
going around in the U.S. where 
there are victims of police bru-
tality,” Gaines said. “I think that 
it’s really important to address 
these issues and continue to 
have these dialogues where peo-
ple can express themselves.”

The BSU will host a follow-up 

event Wednesday evening titled 
“Know Your Rights” at the Trot-
ter Multicultural Center.

M

y friends tell me that 
I’m too political when 
I write, and that those 

who don’t know me 
as a person would 
never understand me 
to be the awkwardly 
funny 
and 
dynami-

cally strange person they see every 
day. They challenged me to write this 
week’s column on something apoliti-
cal, something “fun” and “light” that 
many students could relate to. The 
Golden Globes were a convenient 
excuse for me to tap into my “main-
stream” interests, and share my 
thoughts on popularized cinema and 
television in America.

My new favorite show is “Jane 

the Virgin.” I think it’s brilliant, 
and apparently so does the Hol-
lywood Foreign Press Association. 
It’s a mix of “Ugly Betty” quirk and 
“Gilmore Girls” sentiment, but bet-
ter. Last night, Gina Rodriguez (a.k.a. 
Jane) won the Golden Globe for Best 
Actress in a TV Series, Musical or 
Comedy, beating television veterans 
and icons like Julia Louis-Dreyfus 
and Taylor Schilling.

On this new CW series, Rodri-

guez plays the show’s protagonist, a 
23-year-old virgin who is artificially 
inseminated by accident and decides 
to keep the baby, partly because her 
pregnancy is the father’s only chance 
at biological parenthood. The show 
is a balance of deep respect for reli-

gion with a realistic and admirable 
depiction of the varying factors that 
accompany all reproductive health 
options when it comes to carrying 
a pregnancy to term or terminating 
that pregnancy.

But without intention or effort, I 

watch Jane through a critical frame-
work that deconstructs the meaning 
behind every interaction, theme and 
decision made by this fictional fam-
ily onscreen. And while I think this 
show is brilliantly executed and has 
done a fantastic job portraying vary-
ing 
and 
diverse 

Latino/Latina 
narratives as well 
as tons of queer 
and 
empowered 

women, the show 
still has just one 
element that irks 
me, and that’s the 
name.

Jane is not a 

“virgin.” She is just a 23-year-old 
who has not had a penis in her vagi-
na. Virginity is a social construct. In 
America, virginity is rooted in the 
historic commodification of women 
and a religious precedent of male 
ownership. The concept of virginity 
is meant to make people, especially 
women and non-heterosexual indi-
viduals, feel badly about their sexual-
ity and sexual experience. This social 
concept is a way of policing other peo-
ple’s bodies and classifying a sexual 

social ideal. The virginity of a female 
body is impossible to prove unless an 
individual declares and labels oneself 
as having engaged sexually before. 
But there, too, is an issue, seeing as 
no formal sexual act defines virginal 
status from non-virginal status. It’s 
socially understood that unless a 
penis penetrates a vagina, sex has not 
been had. This definition delegalizes 
anal sex, oral sex and other forms of 
sex as “real sex,” and upholds hetero-
sexual norms. So while I love Jane, I 
do not love the title so aptly given to 

her simply because 
there 
has 
never 

been a penis inside 
her vagina.

I truly adore 

this 
show 
and 

Rodriguez, 
and 

I think that the 
show itself begins 
to 
challenge 

the 
dangerous 

social construct that is “virgin-
ity.” As Jane gradually continues 
to acknowledge that her worth as 
a human being is not tied to her 
sexual activity (or lack thereof), 
every Monday night at 9 p.m. we get 
to watch the deconstruction of this 
historically oppressive concept. I 
think that’s pretty cool.

W

hile raising the mini-
mum wage has always 
been a relevant topic, 

it’s garnered more 
attention 
since 

fast food work-
ers 
began 
pro-

testing 
for 
$15 
 

hourly wage.

I’ve 
heard 

numerous 
opin-

ions 
on 
the 

minimum 
wage, 

ranging 
from 

people 
wanting 

$15 wages to those 
that think we shouldn’t raise the 
minimum wage at all. The minimum 
wage should definitely be raised 
yearly to keep up with inflation, but 
raising it to $15 isn’t a feasible option.

A $15 minimum wage is like com-

munism: a good idea in theory but 
bad in application. I think everyone 
likes the idea of the lowest-income 
citizens doubling their wages, but 
this actually only hurts these citi-
zens. The basic model of labor supply 
and demand shows this.

Since higher wages are incentive 

to work more, the supply of workers 
increases as the wage increases (i.e. 
the supply curve slopes upward).

Contrarily, as the wage increases, 

producers cannot afford to pay for as 
much labor, decreasing the demand 
for workers in the market (i.e. the 
demand curve slopes downward).

This means that the markets will 

adjust until they reach the one wage 
where laborers demanded equals 
laborers supplied. At this point, sup-
pliers are producing as much output 
as they want, and laborers are work-
ing as much as they want.

This doesn’t happen if we have a 

minimum wage higher than the equi-
librium wage.

Setting the minimum wage solidi-

fies a specific wage, meaning that 
the market can’t move to an equi-
librium position. We’re stuck with 
an excess amount of job seekers, 
and as you can see from the chart 
below, this means that a high mini-
mum wage will drive some people 
working at the equilibrium wage 
 

to unemployment.

At least to me, the loss of jobs alone 

is justification not to significantly 
raise the minimum wage. A mini-
mum wage should be helping those 
on the lower socioeconomic end, 
and while some would benefit from 
the increased wages, others would 
be forced into a lower class and be 
unable to find jobs.

This idea isn’t just abstract; it’s 

proven in application.

SeaTac, a suburb of Seattle, recent-

ly raised its minimum wage to $15 
dollars per hour and has seen clear 
consequences. The local hotel closed 
its restaurant, laying off 15 workers in 
addition to a night clerk and mainte-
nance worker.

Additionally, as seen in the labor 

supply model, the increase in wage 
causes an increase of laborers seek-
ing employment. The Clarion Hotel 
has received an influx of applicants 
from outside the city seeking the 
new wage, and as some of these 
people have more skills than current 
employees, the hotel must consider 
laying off less-qualified workers to 
hire better workers, only further 
stratifying minimum wage workers.

Those still employed at the air-

port also incur costs of the increased 
wage. A woman working at the air-
port exclaimed her disdain for the 
changes, revealing how her shiny 
$15 wage came with the loss of 
her 401(k), health insurance, paid 
holidays, vacation, overtime oppor-
tunities and available food while 
working. She also must pay for park-
ing and receives less in tips. These 
losses minimize the benefits of her 
increased wage, indicating that the 
extra money she’s receiving is less 
than the difference between her new 
and previous wage.

Now, all of this may lead you 

to believe I’m against raising the 
minimum wage, but this isn’t com-
pletely true. There’s a difference 
between raising real wages and 
nominal wages, and I support rais-
ing nominal wages so real wages 
stay the same.

Let’s just super quickly define real 

and nominal wages. A nominal wage 
is the numerical amount of money 
that you receive. $12 is always greater 
than $11, and $11 is greater than $10.

Real wages are how many goods 

that your nominal wages can buy 
you. For simplicity, assume the aver-
age price of goods in an economy is 
$2, and you receive $11 per hour. Your 
real wage is $5.50 per hour, because 
it’s relative to what goods cost.

Real wages are more important 

than nominal wages. If you could 
choose between receiving $15 per 
hour when average goods cost $2 and 
$100 per hour when average goods 
cost $50, it’s more economically 
sound to choose the $15 option. Even 
though $100 is more nominal money, 
you can buy more goods with $15 per 
hour, which is the purpose of work.

It’s also important to note that 

the increase in the average price of 
goods — called inflation — occurs 
almost every year in an economy. The 

Bureau of Labor Statistics compiles 
data to discover how much inflation 
occurs each year (I won’t bore you 
with how they do this).

Given 
this 
information, 
it’s 

important that a worker’s nominal 
wage is tied to increase yearly by the 
same percentage as inflation. If this 
didn’t happen, workers would lose 
money each year. Even though their 
actual paycheck wouldn’t decrease, 
they would be less wealthy given 
that everything around them costs 
more money.

Tying the minimum wage to infla-

tion won’t hurt companies, either. 
Since the average prices of the 
products they sell increases, they’re 
bringing in more nominal revenue. 
Providing the excess of this revenue 
to workers only redistributes the 
wealth so companies aren’t benefit-
ing from laborers’ losses.

Now, this is certainly a lot more 

complex in application than in theo-
ry. Not all companies increase their 
prices by the average amount. It is, 
after all, an average. So work would 
need to be done to more accurately 
figure out the price increases across 
different markets to minimize error.

But this system could work very 

effectively. Scaling the minimum 
wage to inflation helps workers hold 
onto their already-low incomes.

This information also explains a 

lot of the misconceptions that exist 
around raising the minimum wage. 
Many websites, even the Bureau of 
Labor Statistics itself, state that rais-
ing the minimum wage won’t cause 
people to lose their jobs. But their 
evidence relies on studies examining 
prior increases in minimum wage.

When you examine the real values 

of these past wages, they are close to 
the real value of the current wage, 
only being a dollar or two greater 
than or less than our current real 
minimum wage of $7.25. These small 
differences aren’t comparable to the 
larger differences that occur with a 
minimum wage of $15.

I’m a huge proponent of helping 

adults who are struggling to live on 
the current minimum wage. I really 
am. An adult working a minimum 
wage job is a constant struggle, but 
we need to focus on policies and ideas 
that will actually help these people. 
Raising the minimum wage will only 
create new problems for people liv-
ing on minimum wage. Instead, we 
need to advocate programs and trade 
schools to help these people move 
into higher-paying positions.

Maximizing the minimum wage

P

resident Barack Obama announced on Jan. 9 a federal proposal 
that aims to extend two years of free tuition to all students 
wishing to attend community college. The president unveiled 

his ambitious plans for higher education in Knoxville, Tennessee, 
where a similar state-level policy has already come to fruition. If all 50 
states participate in the program, an estimated nine million students 
will benefit. Eligible candidates will include solely high-school seniors. 
Socioeconomic status is not a factor for consideration; however, students 
must earn a minimum GPA of 2.5 to maintain their free enrollment. 
While this new proposal is a leap forward for the U.S. education system, 
concerns and amendments still remain for the proposition.

The call for universal access to higher 

education will ensure all students are afforded 
at least two years of community college 
without financial burden, assuming the 
requirements are met. Full-time community 
college students will save approximately 
$3,800 in annual tuition. Due to the climbing 
costs 
of 
higher 
education, 
community 

colleges have become increasingly focused on 
vocational training, as opposed to the liberal 
arts and sciences. With free tuition, students 
will have more liberty to choose majors 
based on passions and interests rather than 
practicality. A high-school degree no longer 
suffices for a wide range of occupations in 
our nation’s society. By 2020, 35 percent of 
job openings will require at least a bachelor’s 
degree, and 30 percent will require some form 
of college education or an associate’s degree. 
The anticipated influx of students will not 
just prepare the youngest generation for the 
workforce, but also stimulate improvement 
in the quality of education community 
 

colleges provide.

The plan is estimated to cost $60 billion 

over a 10-year period. The source of subsidies 
is general at best, which is a cause for concern 
for those who fear that large expenses 
will further push the nation into debt. 
Highlighted in the proposal thus far is the 
following: states that choose to participate in 
the program will be expected to cover one-
quarter of the cost, while federal funding 
will cover the rest. These states will have the 
flexibility to allocate particular resources to 
students in need.

With states slated to have plenty of 

autonomy in the process, they should be 
held responsible for a number of different 

factors. States will have the opportunity to 
create more early intervention and outreach 
programs, 
expand 
community 
college 

offerings and improve the affordability of 
four-year universities. States should also 
ensure that students in need of financial aid 
are guaranteed room and board, books and 
transportation. FAFSA, the financial aid 
application filled out by students across the 
nation, should be streamlined to conveniently 
process school applications and financial 
aid 
packages 
side-by-side. 
With 
these 

considerations, Obama’s proposal will surely 
give American students the competitive edge 
they need to thrive in today’s rapidly-evolving 
economic climate.

The new plan will model after community 

college initiatives in Tennessee, which 
have shown great success. In Tennessee, 90 
percent of high-school students applied to 
the state’s community college program in 
the past year, the first cycle of the program. 
Only 40 percent of Tennessee students 
were expected to apply. Furthermore, the 
Tennessee College of Applied Technology, a 
participant in the program, has a graduation 
rate of 80 percent with 85 percent of students 
placed into jobs, showing the potential and 
demand of a national program to improve the 
work force.

Obama’s proposal foresees many changes 

not just in the education system, but also 
in the long-term economy. The possibility 
for students to receive two years of free 
higher education will enhance the quality of 
community colleges, bridge the segregation 
between students of various socioeconomic 
statuses and provide more job opportunities 
for generations to come.

A college for every community

t’s that time of year again.

Ann Arbor’s biannual Res-

taurant Week begins this Sun-
day. Throughout the week, 
some of the city’s most popular, 
critically acclaimed restaurants 
will offer coveted dishes for 
discounted prices.

The event, which is also held 

annually in June, will feature 
58 participating restaurants. 
Depending on the restaurant, 
throughout the week students 
can purchase a lunch option for 
$15 and dinner option for $28, 
either one price for two people 
or two prices for two people.

This year’s Restaurant Week, 

which will end Jan. 23, coin-
cides with the Martin Luther 
King, Jr. day weekend. Accord-
ing to Maura Thomson, direc-
tor of the Main Street Area 
Association, the wintertime 
Restaurant Week is typically 
busier than the summertime.

“We typically try to choose 

weeks where restaurants are 
historically very slow,” Thom-
son said in a Jan. 2014 inter-
view with the Daily. “We’re 
trying to help restaurants get 
a little more business and give 
people the opportunity to try 
these new places during a time 
when it is not as busy and your 
odds of getting a table are bet-
ter.”

While many of the city’s best 

restaurants participate, here 
are some deals that are too 
good to miss:

JAMAICAN JERK PIT

The Jamaican Jerk pit will 

offer lunch for two people 
(that’s $7.50 per person) for one 
appetizer, an entrée for each 
person served with either a 
soup or sandwich and French 
fries. The pineapple upside-
down cake and coconut cake 
can also be included with the 

dinner option.

SILVIO’S ORGANIC PIZZA

Both Silvio’s lunch and din-

ner menus offer a three-course 
menu with seven options for 
each second course. Menu 
items include a Tartufo calzone 
with shiitake mushrooms and 
truffle oil and Michigan Ravioli 
with walnuts and wild chicory 
mixed in.

MARNEE THAI 
RESTAURANT

A little farther from the pop-

ular Main Street restaurants, 
Marnee Thai samples quality 
Thai food at a discounted price. 
During its lunch hours, the res-
taurant offers meat and veggie 
pre-fixed menus with popular 
Thai entrees and appetizers. A 
dinner-for-two option comes 
with a shareable appetizer and 
dessert, with one entrée for 
each of diner.

THE BLUE NILE

Offering a three-course din-

ner for $28, the Blue Nile is 
notorious for it’s large, family 
style portions and hearty food. 
The deal will get two people 
their choice of appetizer, not 
normally offered on the din-
ner menu, and a sharable plat-
ter of Ethiopian-style cabbage, 
lentils, collard greens, peas and 
meat atop a layer of airy injera 
bread. The deal also includes a 
choice of dessert, like a tradi-
tional bread pudding with rum 
crème anglaise.

THE CHOP HOUSE

Only offering a dinner menu, 

The Chop House offers a choice 
between beef medallions and 
salmon filet, and also offers 
a layered brownie cake with 

MHacks

When it comes to dining 

in college, students must be 
mindful of what they put in 
their bodies. However, how 
students get their food is 
equally essential. 

While making food in a 

kitchen is very cost-effective 
and rewarding, going out for 
a meal can also be rewarding 
and require a lot less work. 
Which is better?

INGREDIENTS

At home: 

At home, you may have less 

to work with when preparing 
your meal. A typical college 
student’s refrigerator might 
contain only a box of pizza, old 
milk and some questionable 
produce items.
Dining out: 

Restaurants have a much 

larger supply and variety of 
ingredients. 
Depending 
on 

where you eat, the kitchen staff 
will probably have a variety of 
food to work with. Knowing 
that every ingredient in your 
food is not near its expiration 
date makes eating out an even 
more pleasurable experience.

AMBIENCE

At home: 

After cooking a meal for 

yourself, where you choose 
to eat is completely up to you. 
More often than not, a meal 
is almost never eaten at a tra-
ditional table. Why eat at a 
table when you could eat your 
meal in bed or on the sofa? The 
ambience and environment is a 
personal choice.
Dining out: 

At a restaurant, eating a 

meal in bed is not an option. 

You must eat at a table, and 
are usually required to use sil-
verware and drape a napkin 
across your lap. The ambience 
may be much more dramatic 
than your couch, but that’s the 
small price to pay for consum-
ing a meal of restaurant qual-
ity.

PRESENTATION

At home: 

Cooking a meal at home is 

hard work. After you’ve fin-
ished cooking, the plate, tray 
or even the apparatus you pre-
pared it in could suffice as a 
surface to eat on.
Dining out: 

A simple chicken dish will 

be artfully presented on a 
clean plate, usually placed 
upon a brightly colored bed of 
rice. The chefs at a restaurant 
are professionals, and want 
each plate of food they create 
to look appealing.

CLEAN-UP

At home: 

Ugh. After you’ve done the 

work to make yourself a meal, 
you have to clean it all up 
yourself. Washing dishes is a 
process that can be done to a 
varying degree of thorough-
ness. A common solution to a 
massive amount of pots and 
pans is conveniently dropping 
them into the sink.
Dining out: 

Dining out at a restaurant 

couldn’t be any more different. 
You’ve eaten your beautifully 
presented meal and are now 
extremely full. The best part? 
With a quick swipe of your 
server, your dirty plates and 
dishes are gone from your sight 
and have been turned over to 
the restaurant employees to 
handle.

Walton indispensable for ‘M’

By MAX BULTMAN

Daily Sports Editor

Just when the Michigan men’s 

basketball team thought it found 
its lockdown defender, it couldn’t 
use him.

Michigan coach John Beilein 

planned 
to 
use 
sophomore 

guard Derrick Walton Jr. as the 
primary defender against Ohio 
State guard D’Angelo Russell. But 
when Walton had to sit most of 
the first half with a pair of early 
fouls, Russell — who torched the 
Wolverines for 21 points and six 
assists in the Buckeyes’ blowout 
victory Tuesday — was able to 
exploit the defensive drop-off 
and lead Ohio State to a 15-point 
halftime lead.

When Walton was in the game, 

despite his lingering toe injury, 
Michigan looked more alert. In 
the game’s first five minutes, 
the Wolverines led 12-9 and 
looked to be in a rhythm. Walton, 
though, picked up his first foul 
in the game’s first minute and 
his second nine minutes later, 
forcing Beilein to play freshman 
guard Muhammad-Ali Abdur-
Rahkman for eight minutes.

With 
Russell 
creating 

an 
athletic 
mismatch, 
the 

Wolverines were forced to use a 
combination of Abdur-Rahkman 
and junior guards Caris LeVert 
and Spike Albrecht on the 
Buckeye freshman.

And when that happened, 

Russell flourished.

It wasn’t that Walton was 

able to lock down the freshman, 
but he did seem to be the only 
one capable of forcing him into 
mistakes. All three of Russell’s 
first-half turnovers came during 
the eight minutes Walton was on 
the court.

“We thought he would be a 

big part (of guarding Russell),” 

Beilein said. “We lose by 19 and 
we’re down 15 at half. I don’t 
think we’re down 15 at half if 
Derrick’s out there playing the 
whole time.”

Michigan didn’t just miss 

Walton’s influence on defense, 
though. 
In 
previous 
games 

this season, including against 
Minnesota on Saturday, Walton 
has been able to generate offense 
for the Wolverines by forcing the 
issue in transition.

He had only one steal against 

the Golden Gophers, but as 
the most athletic defender in 
Michigan’s lineup, he provided 
the most effective ball-handling 
on the break, leading to points 
in transition. The Wolverines 
tallied 
11 
fast-break 
points 

against Minnesota, but just two 
against Ohio State.

Perhaps 
most 
important, 

Walton’s stability defending the 
perimeter 
allowed 
Michigan 

to stay focused on its defensive 
rotations, even when trailing by 
double digits.

“We kind of got into scramble 

mode trying to rotate and trap 
guys to kind of dig ourselves out 
of that hole,” Albrecht said. “We’d 
just mess up on rotations on the 

backside and things like that, and 
they got a few baskets.”

Walton’s 4.8 boards per game 

are the second most on the 
team, making his presence on 
the floor all the more important. 
While the box score shows Ohio 
State technically outrebounded 
Michigan by just three, those 
numbers don’t accurately reflect 
the Buckeyes’ dominance on the 
glass.

And all of that is to say 

nothing of the sloppy play 
Michigan exhibited on offense. 
The Wolverines committed 13 
turnovers, as Abdur-Rahkman 
didn’t transition smoothly into 
Walton’s role.

Really, no one could. Walton’s 

lingering injury, and now his 
foul trouble Tuesday, proves that 
Michigan can’t afford to have 
him miss time.

Questions of not having a 

go-to player outside of LeVert 
have loomed over Michigan all 
season, but they were especially 
present with Walton on the 
bench. The sophomore guard is, 
by necessity, one of the veteran 
voices on the team, and without 
him, the Wolverines looked truly 
lost.

Racine and Nagelvoort continue to compete for time

By ERIN LENNON

Daily Sports Editor

It was almost exactly midway 

through regulation in the No. 19 
Michigan hockey team’s series 
finale against No. 16 Minnesota on 
Saturday when junior goaltender 
Steve Racine surrendered a third 
goal to the Golden Gophers. He 
then signaled for senior forward 
Zach Hyman to relay a message to 
coach Red Berenson.

A few plays later, Racine skated 

to the Wolverines’ bench with 
a broken skate that had been 
causing discomfort. Sophomore 
Zach Nagelvoort set up in the 
crease for the first time since Dec. 
5.

Racine did not return in the 

third period.

“It’s a tough thing to pull 

yourself in the middle of the 
game when your team is ahead,” 
Berenson said. “But at least he 
didn’t hurt the team. Nagelvoort 
had a chance to come in, and he 
helped the team, so it turned out 
fine.”

More than a 7-5 win and a 

series sweep, Saturday’s contest 
was a microcosm of Michigan’s 
goaltending predicament over 

the last two years — Racine 
seemingly securing the starting 
position before suffering an 
injury and Nagelvoort making 
a case for the position before 
Racine’s return.

On 
Saturday, 
Nagelvoort 

was as good as Racine when he 
needed to be, but wasn’t lights-
out. He allowed a pair of goals, 
including one late in the third 
frame to cut the Wolverines’ lead 
to two. Though the duo allowed a 
combined five goals on 31 shots, 
the shared win was largely due to 
Michigan’s four-goal first period.

So just when it looked like 

Racine — who had won his third 
straight game the night before — 
would all but ensure a fifth start 
against Ohio State, Nagelvoort 
changed the conversation once 
again.

“Both their job is just to 

stop the puck,” Berenson said, 
reiterating that decisions will still 
be made on a weekly basis.

In the moment, the switch 

wasn’t all that significant.

“About 
five 
minutes 
after 

Nagelvoort went in, I was asking 
the guys when Steve came out,” 
said freshman defenseman Culter 
Martin.

Added sophomore defenseman 

Michael Downing: “Honestly, I 
didn’t know Nagelvoort was in 
the net until the start of the third 
period.”

Under other circumstances, 

though, 
Downing 
and 
the 

defense may have discussed their 
approach to the distinct styles of 
each netminder.

“A lot of the times we just tell 

Steve to stay in the net,” he said. 
“He doesn’t play the puck that 
much anyways, so we just say stop 
the puck and just worry about 
that. With Nagelvoort, when he’s 
in the net, we know he plays the 
puck.

“We do talk before the games.”
Racine has a good glove, but 

gives up rebounds that often turn 
into golden follow-up chances for 
opponents rushing the net. He 
has worked to minimize those 
rebounds over the last year, but 
still relies heavily on the defense 
to clear pucks.

And yet, he has proven he can 

make the big saves and that he 
can do it consistently enough to 
merit a starting role, as he did 
during his freshman campaign.

Meanwhile, 
Nagelvoort 
is 

calm and confident, nearly to his 

demise. He is vocal and handles 
the puck much more aggressively 
than his counterpart. He has 
also been clutch, so much so that 
the Edmonton Oilers drafted 
Nagelvoort in the fourth round of 
the 2014 NHL Draft.

But for all the accolades, 

Nagelvoort has disappointed this 
season. He has allowed easy, and, 
at times, lazy goals.

It must be noted, though, 

that the Wolverines didn’t give 
Nagelvoort much room for error 
during his first 13 starts. He 
posted a 7-6-0 record in the first 
half, but five of those losses 
came against ranked opponents. 
And over that five-game stretch, 
the offense scored just eight 
times. Often the beneficiary of an 
offensive flurry, Racine is 5-1-0 
after earning just two starts in 
the first half. In six appearances, 

the junior posted a .912 save 
percentage 
despite 
having 

played half as many minutes as 
Nagelvoort.

Most 
importantly, 
the 

Wolverines 
are 
now 
equally 

confident 
in 
both 
starting 

candidates. Racine’s most recent 
stretch, especially, has given a 
young defense an opportunity 
to trust that he will hold strong 
when mistakes are made.

‘M’ gritty before pretty

By BRAD WHIPPLE

Daily Sports Writer

On the first day of preseason 

practice, the Michigan women’s 
basketball team gave itself an 
identity, laying the foundation for 
the kind of basketball it wanted to 
play: a scrappy kind.

The Wolverines claim to be 

“the hardest-working team in 
America,” a phrase spoken by 
coach Kim Barnes Arico in the 
team’s pump-up video before 
games. It echoes throughout 
Crisler Center, holding Michigan 
accountable to be the tenacious 
team it promised it would be.

So 
far 
this 
season, 
the 

Wolverines have been living up 
to day-one expectations.

Sunday, Michigan (3-2 Big 

Ten, 11-5 overall) defeated Ohio 
State, 100-94, after an emotional 
overtime battle that featured 
six lead changes in the final 25 
minutes.

The stat sheet will tell you that 

the Wolverines shot 45 percent 
from the field, and that freshman 
guard Katelynn Flaherty scored a 
career-high 24 points on 6-for-11 
shooting beyond the arc, senior 
guard Shannon Smith scored a 
career-high 36 points and senior 
forward Cyesha Goree grabbed 
more rebounds than the rest of 
Michigan’s starters combined.

But the stats won’t tell you that 

Flaherty played a more physical 
game than ever before. They 
won’t tell you she dove on the 
floor with under two minutes 
left, stole the ball, gave Smith an 
easy fast-break layup and helped 
force overtime. They also won’t 
tell you that Smith took a charge 
in the early minutes of the game 
and pumped her fists in the 
air, setting the tone for several 

similar plays later.

Those 
are 
the 
intangible 

things that won’t show up on the 
scoreboard, but are perhaps the 
plays that matter most.

“Who cares if you have 30 

(points) at the end of the day?” 
Goree said. “At the end of the 
day, if you got that charge to help 
us win the game or that loose 
ball, those are things that people 
outside might not notice, but us in 
the locker room — coaches have 
noticed. That’s what we pride 
ourselves on.”

Barnes Arico quantifies those 

key-play moments by awarding 
block ‘M’ stickers to players after 
games. For the team to earn 10 
or more is extremely rare — by 
that point, Goree said, the team is 
“guaranteed to win.”

Sunday was one of those 

instances.

“You would think that was 

some 
kind 
of 
million-dollar 

prize,” Barnes Arico said. “Doing 
something that is your own 
individual sacrifice for the good 
of the team, you are rewarded 
with that sticker.”

Leading the team in the 

intangible count are Goree and 
senior forward Nicole Elmblad, 
who, along with Smith, embody 
the things Barnes Arico wants 
her younger players to be.

Goree is a robust rebounder, 

Elmblad is a selfless leader and 
Smith is a daring shooter.

They were the key components 

of Sunday’s victory, with Smith 
leading the offensive charge 
while Elmblad and Goree battled 
in the paint to open up guards 
like Flaherty. Now in their last 
year, it’s more important than 
ever to set an example.

“I thought those three guys 

really came together and willed 

our team to victory and wouldn’t 
allow us to lose tonight,” Barnes 
Arico 
said 
after 
Sunday’s 

game. “The three of them were 
sensational.”

Added Goree: “To just get 

Michigan State and Ohio State 
at home, and get both of those 
victories, we wanted to leave that 
mark to show (the newcomers) 
how important it was to us they 
can execute the same way when 
we leave.”

Back in November, Goree — 

who didn’t start once during 
her first two years in Ann Arbor 
and now holds the single-season 
rebounding record with 317 — 
said her progress could help 
inspire the team’s youth to do the 
same. It’s this younger generation 
that will lead the charge in future 
seasons.

“Our conference is exploding,” 

Barnes Arico said. “The best 
players in our league right now 
are freshmen and sophomores. 
The incoming classes that have 
signed with our league are just 
incredible.

“I need those younger ones to 

get scrappy.”

The Wolverines played their 

most physical game against the 
Buckeyes, living up to the mantra 
that the players — young and old 
— heard on day one.

After the game, Barnes Arico 

was thrilled by her team’s 
performance and seemed more 
energetic than ever — she had 
evidence that her team could 
be scrappy. With Barnes Arico 
at the helm, Michigan could be 
the hardest-working team in 
America.

But there’s still a ways to go.
“Tomorrow is a new day, 

though,” she joked. “That’s the 
problem.”

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL

John Spooney: The renaissance man of track and field

By CHRIS CROWDER

Daily Sports Writer

He was two-sport athlete at 

Brown, but that time has long 
since passed.

Now he is an aspiring medical 

school student. He was once 
good enough for a tryout with the 
Baltimore Ravens. He has just ran 
the fourth-fastest 60-meter time 
in school history in his first race 
as a Wolverine. And he has come 
a long way from a childhood near 
Jacksonville, Florida.

Meet 
John 
Spooney, 
the 

renaissance man.

“Once you step on that track, 

you have to feel like you’re 
invincible. Because if you don’t, 
you’re bound to lose,” Spooney 
told the Akron Beacon Journal in 
a video interview after winning 
the Youngstown (Ohio) Division 
One regional title during his 
senior year at Macedonia High 
School.

From 
the 
look 
of 
his 

accomplishments, he has been 
feeling invincible ever since.

After 
high 
school, 
Brown 

was the only institution on his 
list that would let Spooney both 
play football and run track. With 
an offer from an impressive, 
academically-challenging 
university, Spooney chose to 
commit.

He made sure Brown didn’t 

regret its decision.

***

Meet John Spooney, the former 

fastest man in the Ivy League.

On the track, Spooney was 

a 
three-time 
Heptagonal 

Champion in the 100-meter — 
just the fourth person in Ivy 
League history to do so — and 
two-time champion in the 200-
meter, setting school records for 
the Bears in both events.

During his senior year, though, 

the three-time All-Ivy selection 
left the track to focus his attention 
on the gridiron.

“My senior year of football was 

just a big highlight,” Spooney said. 
“It was kind of a dream, I guess.”

His highlights on YouTube 

reveal the makings of a great 

player, providing plays that have 
to be seen to be believed. During 
the first play from scrimmage in 
a game against Penn, Spooney 
bounced off a defender and cut 
through the rest for a 93-yard 
touchdown. His next touchdown 
was another display of blazing 
speed, this time for 94 yards.

Eight 
touchdowns 
later, 

Spooney secured the Ivy League 
rushing title with 1,170 yards — an 
average of 130 yards per game — 
good for fifth in the nation. His 
outstanding 
senior 
campaign 

caught the eyes of some coaches, 
earning him an invite to a rookie 
camp tryout with the Baltimore 
Ravens.

As an undrafted free agent, 

Spooney’s chances to make the 
team were an uphill battle. And 
those chances shrank further 
when he was switched from 
running back to safety.

“I was lost a bit. I didn’t like 

it,” Spooney said. “Because of 
(the position change), I wasn’t 
able to perform to the best of my 
abilities and you have to be at a 
high caliber to be on the football 

team.”

Despite posting a faster 100-

meter time than one of the NFL’s 
speediest running backs, Chris 
Johnson, Spooney didn’t make it 
to the professional level.

But he didn’t let that phase 

him. He had other aspirations 
in his sights, one of which was 
medical school.

Following the conclusion of 

the Ravens’ rookie camp in May, 
one of Spooney’s track coaches at 
Brown began talking to a friend, 
a track coach at Michigan. Soon 
enough, Spooney was notified 
of an opportunity to run track 
for the Wolverines as a graduate 
student with one year of eligibility 
remaining.

Spooney kept his options open 

as the year went on. With summer 
around the corner, he had to make 
a decision.

“Once they got back to me 

about an opportunity to go to 
Michigan to run track, I didn’t 
want to close any doors.” Spooney 
said. “When I realized that 
football was a fleeting thing and 
when it was May I was like, okay, 

what do I need to do to apply to 
grad school at Michigan?”

***

Meet 
John 
Spooney, 
the 

scholar.

Before 
he 
even 
came 
to 

Michigan, Spooney had some 
obstacles in the way. He treated 
the process like he would as if 
he were in the running lane or 
looking for a hole between the 
offensive linemen for him to 
speed through.

“One thing that was kind of 

crazy was that I had to take the 
GRE in a really short amount of 
time, which was kind of stressful, 
but it worked out,” Spooney said. 
“I had taken the MCAT not too 
long before, so I was already in 
test mode.”

As a biology major, Spooney’s 

end goal is medical school. 
But, again, he is keeping his 
opportunities open. He has a 
few other ideas, one of which is 
the military. If the opportunity 
presents itself, he would also 
like to conduct research while 

attending medical school on the 
side, which was the original plan.

No matter how impressive 

John Spooney’s résumé may 
look, though, he is still looking 
to improve on the track. Even 
with the fourth-fastest 60-meter 
time at Michigan, he expects 
more record-setting days on the 
horizon.

“(The record is) cool, but as the 

season goes on, I hope I can get 
faster,” Spooney said. “It’s not a 
one-and-done kind of deal.”

For John Spooney, nothing 

is one and done. He is never 
satisfied, but is always striving 
toward self-improvement. He is 
a man of high aspirations, a man 
who those around him have no 
doubt will succeed, both as an 
athlete and a professional.

He’s a renaissance man, the 

former fastest man in the Ivy 
League and a scholar. But for a 
short time, Spooney will have 
another title. If only for one year, 
the men’s track team will be able 
to call him by another name.

John 
Spooney, 
Michigan 

Wolverine.

M-Agination Films President 

Anna Baumgarten is not a film 
buff.

“This is the most embarrassing 

thing about my film major back-
ground because I don’t watch a 
ton of movies,” she said. I have 
more, since I’ve been at school, but 
I don’t have a lot of influences that 
I could pinpoint (as a filmmaker).”

That may seem odd, consid-

ering Baumgarten oversees the 
annual production of more than 
a dozen student films, but rather 
than reaching her current position 
because of an obsession with films 
and directors, the Screen Arts & 
Cultures senior was motivated by 
a love of writing and performance.

“I always wanted to be a writ-

er,” she said. “When I was in 
second grade, I wanted to be an 
author … And also performance. 
I acted throughout middle school 
and high school, and (film) was the 
combining of those two passions.”

Interested 
in 
screenwriting 

from the time she arrived at the 
University, and curious about 
directing, Baumgarten submitted 
a script to M-Agination, and the 
club accepted it — an unusual but 
extremely exciting opportunity 
for a freshman. She would direct 
that project and continue with 
filmmaking from there.

“I was more writing initially, 

but I fell in love with production 
along the way,” she said.

Baumgarten is now in her sec-

ond year as president of M-Agi-
nation. The club has 16 board 
members and is in its first year of 
a restructured hierarchy. Instead 
of two co-presidents and no other 
leadership positions, like in years 
past, the club now has a president, 
vice president, secretary and trea-
surer, as well as marketing and 
business sections. As leader of the 
club, Baumgarten — who is also 

on the sales career course track at 
the Ross School of Business — gets 
to oversee and manage both the 
business and creative aspects of 
the club.

***

Formed in 2000, M-Agination 

Films is a student-run produc-
tion organization that accepts 
scripts written by students and 
helps those students find actors, 
equipment and funding to film 
those screenplays. Each semester, 
around 30 to 40 eager screenwrit-
ers submit their scripts to the club. 
Everyone on the Board of Produc-
ers reads the scripts, and then 
the club meets to decide which 
projects it wants to produce (usu-
ally resulting in around eight per 
semester).

When describing what they look 

for in the scripts, both Baumgar-
ten and LSA senior Anthony Kalil, 
M-Agination’s vice president and 
a SAC major, point to quality first.

“We’re looking for a good story, 

strong voice, characters that are 
likable and people want to watch,” 
Baumgarten said, who also noted 
that the club aims to produce films 
in a variety of genres each semes-
ter.

But M-Agination also has to 

look at which productions are the 
most ideal for filming in a college 
town with a very small budget, 
and so both Kalil and Baumgarten 
mention feasibility immediately 
after quality. It can be challenging 
to cast roles that aren’t meant to be 
played by college students, or find 
locations if the script calls for a 
scene set somewhere that can’t be 
found in the Ann Arbor area.

“Does it take place on the moon? 

If it does, it’s probably not the best 
material for M-Agination,” Kalil 
said.

Working under Baumgarten 

and Kalil is a group of produc-
ers who oversee the day-to-day 
operations required to make sure 
the films are made. LSA freshman 
Max Doyle originally tried to sub-
mit a script to M-Agination last 
semester. While the club didn’t 
have the resources to produce it, 
they liked his writing and told him 
about an open associate producer 
job, which he took. Doyle is work-
ing on a five-minute drama called 
“Looking Back,” now in the final 
stages of post-production.

“Most of my stuff, being an 

associate producer, actually hap-
pens before we even get on set,” he 
said. “We only really had one full 
day of being on set, but I took up 
my jobs a couple months before 
that, like getting the location 
down and finding all our crew and 
making sure our directors like our 
actors and everyone can meet at 
the same time.”

“I’ve talked to a few real pro-

ducers in the industry, namely 
Christine Vachon,” Doyle contin-
ued. “And she says that being a 
producer is kind of like being an 
executive babysitter. You just got 
to make sure everyone has what 
they need and is at the right place 
at the right time.”

***

The culmination of M-Agina-

tion’s year is its annual film festi-
val. Held at the Michigan Theater, 
this upcoming April will be the 
14th time M-Agination produc-
ers and filmmakers gather to see 
what they’ve accomplished in the 
past two semesters. While many 
of these filmmakers (the ones in 
SAC, especially) may have pre-
sented their class films in Uni-
versity buildings at the annual 
Lightworks Student Film Festival, 
seeing their work projected onto 
the screen at a landmark institu-
tion like the Michigan Theater is 
an entirely unique experience.

Though Lightworks is more 

casual, Baumgarten and Kalil 

shoot to make the M-Agination 
Film Festival a special occasion. 
The festivalgoers dress up for the 
event with a formal dinner this 
year at Sava’s beforehand. In addi-
tion, Baumgarten and Kalil hope 
to include intermission perfor-
mances by ComCo, the Michigan 
Pops Orchestra and other student 
groups that share a residence in 
the University Activities Center.

One of this year’s filmmakers is 

LSA senior Jameson Duggan, also 
a SAC major. Duggan’s M-Agi-
nation project in the Fall 2014 
semester was “Babysitter,” a short 
comedy sketch about a couple’s 
over-the-top interview process in 
their search for someone to care 
for their child.

“Last semester I was doing 

television production, which is 
mainly in the studio, but I didn’t 
have a production class that really 
allowed me to create a film,” Dug-
gan said of his decision to produce 
the film through M-Agination. “I 
had always heard about M-Agi-
nation but I had never tried it, and 
it seemed like a cool way to make 
a movie without having the class 
restrictions on content and time.”

During the production of “Bab-

ysitter,” Duggan worked with two 
M-Agination producers, who set 
up and recorded auditions and 
provided equipment. The club also 
hosted a writers’ workshop to help 
the directors rework their scripts 
to accomodate their relatively lim-

ited resources.

“In the original script, it called 

for a live dog,” Duggan said, “And 
I was like, ‘I don’t actually want to 
work with a live animal,’ so I talk-
ed with them about how we could 
still incorporate that aspect of it 
without having a live dog.”

While Duggan said that his own 

production went fairly smoothly, 
he mentioned one possible pitfall 
that out-of-class filmmakers can 
face.

“Since it’s not for class, since it’s 

for a club, people don’t really need 
to commit,” Duggan said. “On one 
hand it’s great because they’re just 
passionate about the project and 
they want to learn, because it’s not 
all film students, but then, on the 
other side, there’s nothing really 
deterring people from, on the day 
of, being like, ‘Oh, just kidding. I’m 
really busy.’ ”

Duggan said he was luckily able 

to sidestep this problem because 
of his easy-to-shoot script and his 
interested and committed core vol-
unteers.

Doyle, on the other hand, had 

his shoot pushed back a month 
when one of the project’s main 
actors dropped out.

“That’s what being a producer 

is,” he said, “Finding sudden hur-
dles and having to get over them.”

However, working outside of 

class can also be a change of pace 
for SAC majors that can give them 
diverse viewpoints and take off 
some pressure.

“Having that extra mile outside 

the course work is really what lets 
us work outside of the pressure of 
working for a grade and also allows 
us to work with a lot of people 
who aren’t SAC majors, so we get 
a wider range of people to collabo-
rate with within M-Agination,” 
Kalil said.

***

The SAC major officially began 

in 2005, when LSA’s Film and 
Video Program was transformed 
into a new department. While 
M-Agination isn’t just a club made 
up of SAC majors, many of its core 
members and participants wish 
to work in the industry in some 
way after graduation.

Baumgarten is currently work-

ing on her Honors Production 
Thesis, a 30-minute sitcom called 
“Co-Education.” She would like 

to go into producing, and she’s 
planning to move to Los Angeles 
after graduation.

Doyle is undeclared, but is cur-

rently taking SAC classes. He 
would like to move up in M-Agina-
tion and said he “definitely” wants 
to work in the film industry.

Meanwhile, Kalil said that 

entering the film industry is “kind 
of a crapshoot,” but he’s looking 
to build his portfolio and take his 
skills into the advertising indus-
try.

Duggan also hopes to enter the 

industry. With the fast approach-
ing Jan. 25 deadline for submis-
sions for M-Aginations winter 
productions, he’ll likely offer 
assistance with camera work or 
other jobs, rather than directing 
a production.

When describing what kind of 

film he would like to make, Dug-
gan said, “I want to make a movie 
that people enjoy. There are plenty 
of movies that I would say, ‘That 
was a great movie. I really appre-
ciate it, but I don’t really have any 
interest in watching it again.’ So, I’d 
much rather make a movie that was 
less critically acclaimed, but that 
people like to watch over and over 
again, and people like to quote.”

He named “Mean Girls,’ “The 

Perks of Being a Wallflower” and 
“She’s the Man” as examples of 
these kinds of movies.

Even if they don’t want to go on 

to work in the industry, the passion 
that these students bring to the 
film projects is invaluable. “With 
M-Agination, there’s a lot of differ-
ently skilled people coming togeth-
er to collaborate,” Kalil said. “A lot 
of people who aren’t studying film, 
but have a lot of experience in arts 
or in camera. There’s a lot more 
perspective collaborating on some-
thing through M-Agination than 
there is just doing it by myself.”

TRAILER REVIEW

The camera pans down the 

barrel of a sniper rifle until it 
meets the eye of Chris Kyle, the 
most 
lethal 

sniper 
in 

U.S. history. 
He’s got his 
finger on the 
trigger, peer-
ing down the 
scope; it is 
he who must 
watch 
over 

his brothers in arms on the 
ground. In his Texas drawl he 
informs his superiors that he’s 
spotted a woman who appears 
to have handed a grenade to a 
child, not 10 years old. He asks 
for confirmation, which his 
superiors cannot give — “It’s 
your call,” they say. It is Kyle 
who decides who lives and 
who dies, it is Kyle who must 
play God.

This trailer for Clint East-

wood’s (“Jersey Boys”) lat-
est proves the perfect teaser, 
expressing the soul of the 
film without giving away 
any of its action. We sense 
the intensity of not just this 
particular scenario but the 
intensity of Kyle himself, this 
guardian angel, this angel of 
death. Resurrected by Brad-
ley Cooper (“Guardians of 
the Galaxy”), this version of 

the American war hero, tragi-
cally gunned down in 2013, is 
stoic yet sincere, brutish yet 
caring. “American Sniper” 
looks to be a return to form 
for Eastwood and another 
critical success in the blos-
soming career of Cooper. Not 
since “The Hurt Locker” has 
a film about Iraq seemed so 
urgent, and equally timeless.

SINGLE REVIEW

Canadian duo Purity Ring 

released the single “Begin 
Again,” in anticipation of 
their 
newest 

album Anoth-
er 
Eternity, 

set 
to 
drop 

in 
March. 

The 
group 

released 
“Push Pull” in 
2014, then just 
a hint at their 
latest project.

“Begin Again” gives fans a 

much clearer taste of what is 
to come, as well as showcasing 
much of what the duo is gen-
erally known for. The sound 
is oddly celestial, building to 
multiple instrumental breaks 
with full, potent sounds – the 
kind of thing best listened 
to loudly, in dark, crowded 
spaces. Layers include ring-
ing bass, sparse piano and 
crisp down beats throughout 
the chorus.

The vocals, as always, are 

haunting and slightly creepy. 
Megan James’s delivery is 
calm and delicate, entirely 

contrasting the more force-
ful and wobbling beats of the 
track. Lyrics draw on oth-
erworldly imagery, likening 
a lover to the moon and its 
lunar orbit. The track itself 
seems to be traveling along 
its own circular path, as it 
both begins and ends with 
the same lyrics. This affect is 
enhanced with astrologically 
charged lyrics and a round 
sound, not to mention the 
title itself.

While the track closely 

adheres 
to 
the 
standard 

sounds of Purity Ring, it 
is neither predictable nor 
stylistically overdone. The 
track is dynamic. The layers 
of sound seem to be in con-
stant motion, making “Begin 
Again” a strong and seam-
less addition to Purity Ring’s 
small but impressive body of 
work.

LITERARY COLUMN

Starting the year 

on a new page

J

anuary is a time of 
optimism. The days 
are slowly growing 

longer, a fresh layer of snow 
lies 
on the 
ground 
and the 
prom-
ise of 
Spring 
Train-
ing in 
two 
months 
forti-
fies us against the bitter cold.

Invariably, with this renewed 

sense of enthusiasm for the future 
comes New Year’s resolutions. 
Maybe this year your goal is to 
get fit. Or perhaps you’re trying 
to live on a budget. While all are 
no doubt well-intentioned, resolu-
tions have a nasty habit of folding 
under the pressures of daily life.

According to a 2002 study by 

the University of Scranton, about 
a quarter of people abandon their 
New Year’s resolutions after one 
week.

If you’re still on track with 

your original New Year’s resolu-
tion, keep it up, you go-getter, you. 
If, however, you find yourself in 
the dreaded 25%, and you’re cur-
rently filled with both an entire 
large pizza and a copious amount 
of self-loathing, or you’re staring 
at a bank account sitting pretty at 
17 cents, surrounded by hundreds 
of dollars worth of impulse online 
shopping purchases (curse you 
and your outrageously reasonable 
prices, Forever 21!), fear not.

Hope 
springs 
eternal, 
for 

there’s one resolution that’s sim-
ple, effective and almost impos-
sible to screw up.

Read more!

How much more, you ask? Well 

that’s the beauty of it; it’s entirely 
up for you to decide. You could 
do the Goodreads 2015 Reading 
Challenge and choose a specific 
number of books you wish to read 
in the year, or you could set aside 
a set amount of time each day 
devoted exclusively to reading.

I, for one, am participating in 

POPSUGAR’s 2015 Reading Chal-
lenge. The challenge lays out 50 
different literary-themed stipula-
tions, from reading a book with 
more than 500 pages to reading 
a book you started but never fin-
ished. All told, if you don’t use 
a single book to fulfill multiple 
items, the final goal is to read 52 
books by the end of the year (one 
of the conditions is to read a tril-
ogy).

Because I have a penchant for 

planning ahead, I’ve compiled a 
list of titles I plan to use for each 
condition. Looking at my collec-
tion, I feel confident enough to 
say I have a great year of reading 
ahead of me.

What I like about this particu-

lar challenge is that it forces you to 
pick up works you may never have 
chosen to read when left to your 
own devices: a book that came 
out the year you were born (“The 
Giver”), a book that takes place in 
your hometown (“Split Images”), 
a book written by an author with 
your same initials (“Enormous 
Changes at the Last Minute”). The 
list is filled with enough whimsy 
and variety as to ensure a fun and 
diverse literary experience the 
whole year through.

I have put down books I’ve 

been meaning to read for years, 
like Khaled Hosseini’s “The Kite 
Runner” — which will count for a 
popular author’s first book — and 
Joseph Heller’s satirical classic 

“Catch-22” — a book with a num-
ber in the title.

And I will finally, FINALLY 

read something by Neil Gaiman. 
I know, I know, I don’t know how 
I’ve managed not to read anything 
by him yet. I even follow the man 
on Tumblr for God’s sake. But I’ll 
be making up for lost time this 
year with both “Neverwhere” and 
“The Sandman,” so cut me some 
slack.

My list also includes books I 

fully intended on reading this 
year anyway, such as the always 
delightful Amy Poehler’s “Yes 
Please,” as well as my third 
encounter with the brilliant 
sophisticate 
Edith 
Wharton 

with “The House of Mirth.” One 
of the books I’m most excited to 
get started on is Joe Gola’s “The 
Satanic Bridegroom,” a self-
published work written in the 
Lovecraftian vein that, I have on 
good authority, does the Weird 
Fiction genre (a mix of ghost 
story and speculative fiction) 
proud.

Of course, some books will be 

easier to get through than oth-
ers. I’m not particularly looking 
forward to the book with bad 
reviews condition, as I’ve settled 
on a work entitled “Mr. Darcy, 
Vampyre.” It might be uninten-
tionally hilarious or downright 
torturous, but either way it’s 
sure to be an experience.

So if you’re feeling adventur-

ous, come take the 2015 Reading 
Challenge with me. And if by 
any chance someone can recom-
mend a book with a love triangle 
that isn’t (shudder) young adult 
fiction, I’d be much obliged.

University carilloneur Kipp Cortez plays the bells in the Burton Memorial Bell Tower.
University carillon 
rings above campus

By DANIELLE

RAYKHINSHTEYN

Daily Arts Writer

The bucket list of a typical 

University student reads some-
thing like this: go to Rick’s, 
paint the Rock, sneak into a din-
ing hall, blackout at Rick’s, spin 
the Cube, swing on the swing in 
front of UMMA, go to Skeeps 
after Rick’s, go see if Shady is 
really all that shady, attend at 
least 14 football Saturdays ...

And, finally, see a carillon 

being played.

The carillons — the techni-

cal name for the multiple-bell 
instruments that sit atop Bur-
ton Memorial Tower on Central 
Campus and the Ann and Rob-
ert H. Lurie Tower on North 
Campus — are played every 
weekday from 12:00 p.m. to 
12:30 p.m. and from 1:30 p.m. to 
2:00 p.m. on Central and North, 
respectively. At those times, 
they are open to the public.

“When people do come up 

here and see it and realize 
where this music is coming 
from, their jaws just hit the 
floor,” said University carillon-
neur Kipp Cortez.

As University carillonneur, 

Cortez plays the bells, teach-
es others how to play them 
and organizes other carillon 
necessities such as the recital 
schedule, keeping up the Face-
book page and making sure the 
instruments undergo regular 
maintenance.

The bells themselves never 

need to be retuned, but every 
year, the same bell foundry that 
built the Burton Carillon, John 
Taylor & Co., will check other 
parts of the instrument such as 
the wooden levers used to play 
it, for loose or worn-out parts.

The Burton Tower Carillon, 

built in 1936, is the third-heavi-
est carillon in the world, mea-
suring in at 43 tons, the lightest 
of which weighs 15 pounds and 
the heaviest of which weighs 12 
tons. Yes, tons.

The carillon is situated at the 

very top of the Burton Tower, 
two floors above where the ele-
vator stops. On the ninth floor 
is Cortez’s office, and at the top 
of a rather narrow set of stairs 
beginning in the hallway out-
side of his office sits the instru-
ment.

The Ann and Robert H. Caril-

lon was built in 1996 and has 60 
bells, but they are much smaller 
than those housed in the Burton 
Memorial Tower.

“We have two carillons on 

this campus, which is so unusu-
al. It’s totally not the norm,” 
Cortez said.

Cortez began his musical 

career in eighth grade, when 
he began taking organ lessons, 
which he became intrigued by 
after seeing one at church. After 
attending Valparaiso Univer-
sity for his bachelor’s degree in 
organ performance and church 
music and the University for his 
master’s degree in organ per-
formance, he began pursuing 
his doctorate in musical perfor-
mance at the University as well. 
It was during this time, in April 
2013, that he became a carillon 
Graduate Student Instructor 
and was put in charge of all car-
illon matters.

“I’m an organist, and I like 

big instruments,” Cortez said. 
“One day I decided that the 
organ was no longer big enough 
or loud enough, and I thought 
to myself, ‘Wicked cool to have 
a big-ass carillon.’ ”

While Cortez said that he is 

the one person who plays the 
instrument most often, he also 
had six carillon students during 
the Fall 2014 semester who also 
played.

“When the instrument was 

built, the dean of the music 
school said that it would become 
the voice of the University,” 
Cortez said. “What I take that 
to mean is that these are the 
musical expressions and styl-
ings of the students of the Uni-
versity. They’re able to express 
themselves on this instrument 
for the whole campus to hear.”

Cortez added that only one 

of these six students is in the 
School of Music, Theatre & 
Dance, and he would never 
deter anyone who wanted to 
learn to play the instrument.

“Most people just go blindly 

searching for ‘Michigan bells,’ 
and it turns out, ‘Oh, this is a 
musical instrument! Oh, I can 
learn to play this! Oh, this is 
awesome!’ ”

The carillon resembles a 

piano in the sense that it has 
foot pedals and keys spanning 
several 
octaves. 
Instead 
of 

the white and black keys of a 
piano, the carillon is composed 
of wooden levers that, when 
pushed down using a soft fist, 
move a lever that rings the cor-
responding bell. The foot ped-
als on the carillon are linked to 
the larger bells, as more force is 
required to ring them.

“The sound of the bells is mar-

velous,” Cortez said. “The instru-
ments we have here are just world 
class instruments. It’s such a priv-
ilege to come up here and make 
music and to share it with other 
students, with the community 
and with the rest of the campus.”

Cortez said he has an arsenal of 

songs that he generally repeats, 
but he likes to add in at least one 
new song every week, and there 
is a large amount of music avail-
able for the carillon. He also said 
there is a responsibility as a caril-
lonneur to be cognizant of world 
events and to play songs accord-
ingly.

“What we carillonneurs try 

to do is to be sensitive to hap-
penings around campus, things 
that happen in the state and 
around the world,” he said. “On 
Veterans Day or on the Fourth 
of July, we’ll do a program of 
patriotic music.”

“The day after (the Ottawa 

shooting) I played the Cana-
dian national anthem, as part 
of standing in solidarity with 
them to the north.”

Cortez said he ultimately sees 

this instrument as something 
for the students, as it reaches 
most students’ ears every single 
day. While the bells that ring 
every 15 minutes are mecha-
nized, the carillon is an instru-
ment he encourages everyone to 
learn or at least come see.

“When you hear real music 

coming out of the tower, it is 
actually a human being,” Cor-
tez said.

If you would like to learn to 

play the carillon, you may apply 
for the class through the SMTD 
website or contact Kipp Cortez 
directly at kippcor@umich.edu.

EPISODE REVIEW

Last week, Lifetime brought 

a popular British television 
show to the 
American 
screen. 
Over 

the course of 
eight 
weeks, 

the American 
MENSA holds 
a competition 
that tests 20 
of the coun-
try’s 
most 

intelligent and 
well-rounded 
children, all of whom are under 
twelve. They endure a series of 
extensive quizzes, answering 
questions on high school level 
mathematics, world geography 
and history, SAT vocabulary, 
science and other subjects. The 
show cuts from question to 
question quickly, barely allow-
ing the audience time to process 
the information or play along 
like in other game shows, dem-
onstrating how the topics fly 
over our heads even as adults.

The show opens with insight 

into each contestant’s “normal” 
home life. The preparation 
behind the scenes is toilsome 
and exhausting, but the grand 
prize is enticing: $100,000 
toward 
college, 
and 
more 

importantly, the prestigious title 
of Child Genius. Thus, for the 
kids, their days include rigorous 
intellectual training routines, 
various extracurricular lessons 
and parents who drill them 
without cessation. One mother 
justifies to her son, “I’m not a 
Tiger Mommy … (I) just don’t 
want you to look like an idiot.”

At the end of the episode, half 

of the contestants are cut – to 
their disheartening sobs, and 
their parents’ scowls. Though it 
should be uplifting to see poten-
tial in a generation that will 
lead our future, “Child Genius” 
is often labeled as “the most 
controversial reality TV show.” 
Even before they have reached 
double-digit ages, these chil-
dren’s greatest fears are failure 
and disappointment. The series 
is not unlike other reality televi-
sion programs that “exhibit” (or 
exploit?) the talents of today’s 
youth. Is this a worthwhile price 
for precocity?

SINGLE REVIEW

Doped up and peacocking 

for a pretty lady in a crappy 
diner is the premise of Child-
ish Gambino’s 
newest music 
video 
for 

“Sober.” Don-
ning 
cords 

and a cardi-
gan, 
Gam-

bino stumbles 
across a diner, 
overconfi-
dent and drugged, to converse 
with the curly-haired woman 
sipping at her soda. The lyrics 
paint the video’s storyline, “And 
now that it’s over / I’ll never be 
sober / and now I’m so high.” As 
the nervous diner chick starts 
to distance herself from the 
inebriated fellow with a pocket 
tee, the video transitions into an 
awesome 21st century mating 
ritual. Is this a stoner’s drug-
induced fantasy? Or perhaps 
this is the classic correlation 
between drunken heartbreak 
and a rebound? Or is the diner 
chick his lost love? Who cares. 

The video’s intention is untel-
lable and relatively unimportant 
in comparison with the simple 
creativity of Gambino’s perfor-
mance. 
Funny, 
idiosyncratic 

and suave, especially following 
a clever admission of “I’M SO 
HIGH,” 
Gambino’s 
perfor-

mance is viscerally enjoyable. 
This is a video not meant for 
excessive deliberation or analy-
sis; instead, as a viewer, give this 
video a quick YouTube search 
and watch a great performer 
present a great performance.

Never before has a perfor-

mance by Childish Gambino 
felt as close to the rapper’s true 
identity: comedian, actor and 
screenwriter Donald Glover. 
Gambino, in comparison to 
Glover, has always appeared 
rougher, tougher and more 
capable of actually fighting 
Drake. Complete with carefree 
air guitar performances and 
magic tricks involving doves, 
the randomness and creativity 
underlying his additions draw 
the rapper persona closer to its 
highly intellectual counterpart.

 -“East Coker,” T.S Eliot
I’m nearing 

the end of a 
month-long 
layover. 
On 

December 
16, 
I 
flew 

from Detroit 
to 
Boston. 

And on the 
evening 
of 

January 
21, 

I’ll 
board 

a 
plane 
in 

Boston headed for Rome, to study 
and eat and file this very column. 
When my editors approved my 
proposal to write pieces from 
Italy, they mentioned I would 
have a column due before I made 

my transatlantic journey.

“Write 
something 
about 

Boston!” they suggested.

A good idea, but harder than 

one might think. Not that there’s 
a dearth of word-worthy edibles 
in Beantown — in fact, it’s the 
opposite. I could tell you about 
the perfect fried oysters I ate 
at B & G last weekend, how the 
crisp crust contained a nugget 
of briny, almost molten meat, 
how they were served in their 
original shells. I could give you 
my practiced rant about how 
the pizza in Boston is actually 
better than the pizza in New 
York. I could wax poetic about 
the sausage sandwiches with 
peppers and onions that carts sell 
outside of Fenway Park.

But after a few paragraphs 

of that, I’m sure you’d get tired. 
When I ran out of adjectives 

and alliteration, there’d be that 
dreaded 
“So 
what?” 
Simply 

describing the food scene of 
my home city could only hold 
your attention for so long. Good 
food writing — good writing of 
any kind — always starts with a 
question. Here’s mine: Why did 
the cold spaghetti I ate out of a 
tupperware at 2 a.m the other 
night taste so bad?

Sorry, I’ll back up a bit. I’m 

not really from Boston, you see. I 
actually hail from a suburb called 
Concord, whose revolutionary 
and literary lore you probably 
learned about in high-school 
history. I associate my house — 
cappuccino-colored 
exterior, 

just down the road from a farm 
— with food. I have many happy 
memories of childhood dishes: 
tomato sauce, roasted chicken,

We were in the depth of Janu-

ary freeze, and the barren woods 
of North Campus were honestly 
the last place I wanted to be in 
the dark. With frozen fingers 
and sweaty palms, I blindly felt 
my way around Pierpont’s Wi-Fi 
and 
service-less 
basement, 

searching for this godforsaken 
“reflection room.” I finally hap-
pened upon a reclusive and bleak 
– but tranquil – room used as an 
artists’ escape.

Jenny walked in just a few 

minutes 
later, 
clearly 
much 

more familiar with the space. 
She made herself at home, and 
immediately colored the bare 
walls with an animated energy. 
As she detailed her passion proj-
ect, it was clear her ambitions 
were lofty, grander than her 

petite stature suggested she was 
capable of.

I first heard about Jennifer 

Larson when I attended the Uni-
versity’s Lightworks Film Fes-
tival this past December, where 
her trailer won the Best Docu-
mentary award. Larson gradu-
ated with a degree in Screen Arts 
and Cultures shortly after the 
premiere, and now devotes all 
her time to expanding her docu-
mentary trailer into a formidable 
full-length project.

Though film is her principal 

medium, Larson also has exten-
sive photography and graphic 
design portfolios called “The 
Larson Lens.” She has worked 
on dramatic and comedic shorts 
before, but she considers docu-
mentary her forte – pieces that 
intertwine shots of people in 
their fields with interview clips 
from community members. By 

combining action scenes with 
poignant 
commentary, 
Lar-

son aims to bring awareness to 
inspiring, real-life stories she 
believes are worth sharing.

Growing up in Royal Oak, 

Larson always had an eclectic 
array of interests, but she was 
certain she would make a living 
out from her creativity. Though 
she never took any art classes 
beyond middle school man-
dates, she rooted herself in the 
University’s School of Art and 
Design. It was at her Sophomore 
Review at the end of her sec-
ond year, that professors saw a 
different spark in her – a spark 
they declared bluntly as, “You 
belong in the film school.”

On a shaky whim, she trans-

ferred into LSA’s Screen Arts 
and Cultures program, even 
though she was taking a risk so 
late into her college career. Over

Univeristy alum Jennifer Larson chronicles the Cooley Reuse Project. 

IN

FOOD COLUMN

Home is where the 

hunger is

time, she smoothly transitioned 
from her art background to pro-
duction design in film. Soon, she 
made a larger discovery in her 
new field.

“I very much enjoy doing the 

artistic side of things, but my 
passion is still with documen-
taries … I’m very committed to 
sharing stories and messages, 
especially ones that aren’t given 
enough attention by the media,” 
Larson said.

Appropriately, 
her 
current 

passion project is to film the 
progress of the Cooley Reuse 
Project in Detroit – an endeavor 
set to span the course of the next 
five years.

Nicole Pitts, the project’s 

creator, stumbled upon Cooley 
High School – a magnificent 
building 
of 
Spanish-Renais-

sance exterior and terribly 
dilapidated interior – acciden-
tally. In 2010, the school was 
unfortunately closed due to 
lack of sufficient enrollment 
and budget. It is now Pitts’ 
mission to raise the funding to 
purchase the property – then 
fully revive and remodel it as a 
community center, which will 
include job training services, 
gym facilities, mixed-income 
residential housing and other 
resources for the Detroit com-
munity.

CRP 
is 
primarily 
Nicole 

Pitts’s project, but it is Larson’s 
job is to follow and document 
the process and progress. Her 
connection with Pitts traces 
back to her early adolescence, 
as Larson’s mother and Pitts 
are colleagues at Oakland Com-
munity College. Larson and 
Pitts have known each other 
for about 10 years, and just last 
year, Larson latched her own 
project onto Pitts’s.

As Larson puts it, “(the CRP 

is) going to help rebuild the 
community, bring more power 
to it, give more opportunities 
to people in that area who don’t 

feel like they have anyone to 
reach out to. They don’t know 
where to go to get on their feet – 
to be more successful.”

As a filmmaker who cares 

deeply about Detroit, Larson 
knows there is a whole city of 
unique options she can high-
light on film. However, what 
initially attracted her to CRP 
was not only Nicole Pitts’s cha-
risma, but a proud sense of duty.

Larson explained, “I feel 

like (Detroit’s) my home. It’s 
an underdog city that is por-
trayed in a grossly negative 
light … The particular stories I 
want to tell are the ones that I 
think will have a positive influ-
ence … Nicole Pitts and her 
Cooley Reuse Project are defi-
nitely something that should be 

known at least by the people of 
the Detroit and Michigan area.”

It’s this dedication to her 

passion and her personal proj-
ect that is tremendously inspir-
ing. Larson plans on releasing 
the documentary in three sepa-
rate 30-minute segments: the 
pre-development, the purchase 
of the property and finally the 
completion’s effect on the com-
munity. As advised by one of 
her SAC professors, she intends 
to package her completed film 
on Seed and Spark, an online 
forum for independent film-
makers to share their passion 
projects.

Larson has since become an 

integral CRP member, as well. 
She has thus far used her per-
sonal funds and equipment to 

fuel her own project – without 
even a Kickstarter campaign 
to buttress her financially. The 
scope of the project is a hefty 
one – one most fresh post-grads 
and budding filmmakers would 
not immediately commit to.

“(My film) shows the people 

in Detroit … coming together 
to make something better for 
themselves, to benefit further 
generations – and to help bring 
back the phoenix rising from 
the ashes,” she says.

Larson’s 
upcoming 
mis-

sion is a trailer event to bring 
a swarm of support out to vol-
unteer on Martin Luther King, 
Jr. Day this year, where she and 
Pitts hope to clean the outside 
of Cooley High School to make 
it safer even before it opens to 
the public. Slowly but surely, 
she will aid in making the 
revival of Cooley High and the 
completion on her film both a 
reality.

“Apathy is a huge problem 

in our youth and in our soci-
ety today,” she said. “One of 
my goals as a filmmaker is to 
make my spectators active… 
I’m 
hoping 
that 
something 

they take away will be a spark 
… something that drives them 
to … make a change, to be more 
involved in their community.”

Even in her language, it is 

clear 
artistic 
thought 
runs 

through her every nerve – and 
empathy is a quality so genuine 
to her character. Larson holds 
up her coffee cup to help visu-
ally demonstrate a metaphor.

“Say my coffee cup is a soda 

can … and you try to open it and 
the tab pops off … Something 
is only as strong as its weak-
est point,” she explained. “The 
weakest point would be Detroit 
and this situation in America, 
and … it’s important for – even 
if you’re in California or New 
Mexico or Arizona or wher-
ever – you should care about 
Detroit.”

“I’m hoping that 
something they 
take away will 

be a spark.”

still do now. I liked the leftovers 
even better; there was always 
something sinfully illicit about 
heating them up late at night.

Much of modern gastronomy 

is, paradoxically, sentimental. 
Great chefs — even ones who 
use liquid nitrogen and make 
foams — often create dishes that 
reheat 
long-frozen 
memories. 

Thomas Keller, whose French 
Laundry was once named the 
best restaurant in the country, 
used to make miniature grilled 
cheese sandwiches with tomato-
water 
soup. 
David 
Chang’s 

Momofuku Ko (two Michelin 
stars) serves fried apple pies 
with 
miso 
butterscotch 
for 

dessert, a refined version of the 
McDonald’s classic. Countless 
other 
chefs 
dish 
out 
these 

Proustian moments, and there is 
no shortage of customers eager to 
experience them.

I assumed, then, that chowing 

down on my cold spaghetti would 
be full of delicious nostalgia. 
When the sweet sauce, thickly 
caked on the spaghetti, hit my 
palate, it would fire some well-
seasoned neurons and flood me 
with halcyon feelings. I would be 
14 again, having a snack before a 
long Friday-night sleep.

But therein lies the problem. 

It’s probably fun for a 40 year old 
to be reminded of their favorite 
food when they were 14. At 20, 
in that anxious layover between 
adolescence and adulthood, it 
wasn’t fun to feel like a teenager 
again. 
Why? 
Because 
that 

spaghetti tasted so simple, so 
comfortable, so easy. In a forkful 
of pasta I had regressed, and saw 
how easy it could be to do that 
over and over and over.

Maybe I was alone in this 

feeling. I associate my house 
— my whole childhood — so 
strongly with food, but then 
again, my parents spent a large 
amount of time and money 
cooking and shopping and eating 
with my siblings and me. Did 
others have such good memories 
of eating at home? I made a 
simple survey, and sent it out to 
scores of friends, asking if the 
food at home or at school was 
better. I checked a day later, and 
83 percent of them had chosen 
“home.”

Students like myself are in a 

bit of a half-sour pickle. Most 
of us hope when we leave for 
college we’ll transition from the 
kid version of everything to the 
adult version. Sleepovers with a 
pilfered 12-pack will be replaced 
by keggers. A rigid curriculum 

will be replaced by classes you’re 
actually interested in. Singles are 
finally stretched into home runs. 
It’s rare that I meet a college 
student who misses high school.

And yet, most of us miss the 

food of our childhoods, and aren’t 
that excited about “eating like 
adults.” At an age when many of us 
so desperately want to, and often 
need to, forget the practices of our 
youth, food is the one thing that 
we often don’t want to change. 
But because food is so infused 
with the essence of childhood, 
the simple act of eating can bring 
many of us to a state that we 
struggle to move out of.

The other night, I was roasting 

a chicken with some garlic and 
herbs. I remember being small and 
getting on my tippy-toes to place 
my nose near the oven, to breathe 
in the wonderful, exciting aroma 
of ingredients transforming into a 
meal. This night, I hunched over 
and inhaled the fumes, like the 
oracles of Ancient Greece, hoping 
they would tell me something.

My chicken needed to cook 

longer.

chicken. To help him pass the time,
