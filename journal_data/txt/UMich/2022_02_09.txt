Trigger Warning: This article 

contains descriptions of sexual 
assault.

University of Michigan alumni 

and survivors of former U-M 
American Culture lecturer Bruce 
Confoth came together at a virtual 
press conference Monday morning 
to announce they would be filing 
a lawsuit against the University 
for failing to adequately protect 
students 
against 
a 
predatory 

professor. 

In 
total, 
there 
are 
eight 

U-M alumni — who attended 
the University between 2004 
and 2017 and are survivors of 
Conforth’s 
abuse 
— 
involved 

with the lawsuit. They are being 
represented by Michigan law firm 
Grewal Law and said they will be 
filing the initial complaint with 
the Washington County Circuit 
Court.

Several sexual assault allegations 

against Conforth, including those 
for inappropriate emails and rape, 
came to light on April 23, 2021. It 
wasn’t until 2017, Conforth retired 
from the University after previously 
winning the 2012 Golden Apple 
Award for most outstanding U-M 
instructor. 

Nolan Erickson, a legal counsel 

for some of the Conforth survivors, 
said the University was complacent 

despite knowing of Conforth’s 
sexual 
misconduct 
allegations 

during his professorship.

“Even after (the University) 

learned 
of 
the 
professor’s 

misconduct because of student 
complaints in 2008, it did not 
prevent him from committing 
further abuses or warn students 
about 
his 
behavior,” 
Erickson 

said. “What followed was nearly a 
decade of serial abuse in the form 
of sexual harassment and sexual 
abuse of students.”

Katherine 
McMahan, 
who 

graduated from the University in 
2008, is one of the survivors who 
spoke at Monday’s press conference. 
McMahan 
said 
Conforth 
had 

invited her and other students to a 
bar outside of class one night and 
bought everyone a round of drinks. 
She alleged that when she got up 
to use the restroom, Conforth 
cornered her, grabbed her waist and 
repeatedly asked her to sleep in his 
home. After that incident, McMahan 
said she received multiple emails 
from Conforth asking her to not 
report what had happened. 

“He hoped that I wouldn’t 

do anything rash (and that) he 
had his career to think about,” 
McMahan said. “Bruce knew 
what he did was wrong. It was not 
something a professor should do 
with a student and he was trying 
to guilt me into staying silent.”

ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Anderson protestors say work is far from 
over following $490 million settlement

Vaughn, Christian reflect on agreement, continue to advocate for stronger misconduct policies at UMich 

Survivors of the late University 

Athletic Doctor Robert Anderson 
say they are not done protesting 
the University of Michigan for 
strengthening sexual misconduct 
policies and protecting students 
on campus, following the $490 
million 
settlement 
with 
the 

University. 

102 days after former U-M 

football player Jonathan Vaughn 
first began protesting outside 

former University President Mark 
Schlissel’s house, the University 
announced — after over 15 months 
of mediation — they had reached 
a $490 million settlement with 
1,050 survivors of the late Dr. 
Robert Anderson. 

Vaughn told The Michigan 

Daily the settlement was an 
important milestone, but his work 
is far from over.

“It’s an amazing win in the 

battle, but it doesn’t even remotely 
end the war,” Vaughn said. “My 
attitude is really business as usual.”

While 
Vaughn 
said 
he 

appreciates that a settlement 

was reached and that it is an 
important part of the healing 
process 
for 
some 
of 
the 

survivors, he said he is still 
waiting to hear many of the 
details of the settlement.

“We know what the number is, 

we don’t know all the provisions … 
We’re looking at probably a 60 or 
70 page document when it’s all said 
and done,” Vaughn said. 

The 
settlement 
— 
which 

provides $460 million to the 
current claimants and allots 
the remaining $30 million to 
claimants who opt in before July 
31, 2023 — was widely reported 

to include a clause stipulating 
Vaughn end his protest. 

Vaughn said he wasn’t aware 

that his leaving was part of the 
settlement and was still evaluating 
the next steps for his protest. 

“I’m 
in 
a 
wait-and-see 

mode (about the status of his 
protest) because I don’t think 
anything has changed,” Vaughn 
said. “There still needs to be 
institutional reform within the 
University of Michigan as it 
pertains to student health, sexual 
assault and rape cover-ups.”

 Eight U-M alumni sue University for 

failing to protect students

The University of Michigan’s 

Office of Multi-Ethnic Student 
Affairs hosted the opening ceremony 
of Black History Month Tuesday 
afternoon. The opening ceremony 
consisted of spoken word, music 
performances and a keynote address 
delivered by Dr. Naomi André, 
professor of Women’s Studies. 

MESA’s theme for Black History 

Month 2022 is Black Joy. According 
to 
the 
Black 
History 
Month 

committee, “Black Joy shows that as 
Black people, despite the centuries of 
trauma we have experienced, we are 
proud to be who we are. No matter 
where we come from or what we 
identify as, we are one and we are 
happy to be Black.”

The opening ceremony consisted 

of a spoken word performance by 
LSA sophomore Benjamin Colding 
titled “Joy is Pride”. 

“I can go down this Zoom call 

and bet money that dang near all 
of us have been slammed, sneered 
at, slided and slandered for, I don’t 
know, wearing caps indoors, wearing 
hoods when it’s cold, letting our hair 
chill in its natural state, and just not 
giving in to many unsung pressures 
emitted by an abundance of forces in 
society,” Colding said. “And instead of 
dropping out, and instead decided to 
pursue their ideal images of successes 
with nothing but twinkles in their 
eyes.”

Colding said he feels pride and joy 

for the accomplishments of the Black 
community.

“From dang near nothing, we built 

a culture that would sing its influence 

globally, and ain’t there power in 
that?” Colding said. “With our 
predecessors as our teachers have we 
gained a top-tier education and ain’t 
there strength in that? With nothing 
but our hands and feet did we imbue 
ourselves within an abundance of 
skills and talents and ain’t there joy 
in that?” 

Neika White, a U-M alum and 

administrative assistant for MESA, 
spoke at the opening ceremony and 
said she believes Black joy is knowing 
you belong everywhere you go. 

“Black joy means that so many 

things keep happening to my people, 
I have to stand up and make a choice 
everyday that am I going to show up, 
or am I just going to be there,” White 
said. “Sometimes you have no choice 
to decide whether you are going to be 
there or not because the minute you 
show up you stand out.”

Dillon Cathro, program manager 

for MESA, also spoke at the event 
and said Black History Month is 
important as a space for Black people 
to share their experiences and joy 
since these spaces are hard to come 
by.

“Blackness is not a monolithic 

experience,” Cathro said. “Black, 
Blackness, 
Afro-descendentness, 

whatever you wanna call it, means 
something 
different 
to 
every 

person,” Dylan said. “But that 
experience being Black is unified. 
It’s not everyday that we get to 
have a space like this to share in 
commonality, to share in joy, because 
we are oftentimes talking about 
things that are not joyous when it 
applies to Black communities.”

 Seven Michigan Starbucks locations 
unionize for greater autonomy, safer 

COVID-19 protocol

Majority of employees at these MI chains have signed union authorization cards

Starbucks employees at seven 

Michigan locations — five in Ann 
Arbor — announced they are 
moving to unionize in protest of the 
company ending hazard pay during 
the COVID-19 pandemic as well as 
the limited safety protocols. 

The news came after several 

other Starbucks locations across 
the 
country 
signaled 
their 

plans to unionize, including the 

first company-owned store to 
successfully unionize in Buffalo, 
New 
York. 
The 
locations 
in 

Michigan submitted their petition 
for union elections to the National 
Labor Relations Board on Jan. 28. 

The Michigan locations will be 

organizing with Workers United 
(SEIU) and will also be joining 
the Starbucks Workers United 
movement. According to a press 
release obtained by The Michigan 
Daily, a majority of workers at the 
Michigan locations signed union 
authorization cards indicating their 

support of the move to unionize. 

News of the unionization came 

as a result of rising frustrations 
among workers at the Michigan 
locations. Ryder Meilstrup-Eady, a 
shift supervisor at the Washtenaw 
Avenue location, detailed a harsh 
work environment, saying he and 
his coworkers often joked about 
the toll their work experiences had 
on their lives and relationships 
with other workers.

“We all like to joke about work 

trauma, or how work trauma 
brings us together,” Meilstrup-

Eady said. “But honestly, that’s not 
really a joke.”

Starbucks employees also said 

another source of stress falls on 
understaffing, a factor that many 
local and national businesses 
have recently experienced due 
to COVID-19. Jina Henderson — 
an employee at the Washtenaw 
Avenue location — detailed how 
understaffing affects them, especially 
in the midst of increased call-offs due 
to employees needing to call in sick.

BUSINESS

Cinnaholic, 
an 
Atlanta-based 

vegan bakery chain with locations 
across the United States and Canada, 
opened its first Michigan location in 
Ann Arbor on Friday morning. The 
store sold its specialty cinnamon 
rolls at $1 to the customers braving 
the freezing temperatures for the 
opening event. 

U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell spoke 

at the ribbon cutting ceremony. She 
told the crowd — which stretched a 
block down East Liberty Street — she 
enjoys cinnamon rolls and is happy to 
have the new business in the city. 

“I am a cinnaholic … I will be their 

best customer,” Dingell said. “I’ll be 
in line first thing … This is an exciting 
day for Ann Arbor.” 

Deborah 
Boener 
and 
Doug 

Moeller, the owners of the Ann 

Arbor location, moved to Michigan 

after losing their California home to a 
wildfire in 2018. In an interview with 
The Michigan Daily, Boener and 
Moeller said they were excited about 
their decision to open the bakery.

“We saved for two years to try to 

figure out if we were going to rebuild 
the house,” Boener said. “And we just 
decided we were going to rebuild our 
lives instead.” 

The couple decided to open a 

Cinnaholic location after Moeller 
left the corporate world because 
they frequently ate at a Cinnaholic in 
Berkeley, California.

“(We’re) just so thrilled to be 

doing it in Ann Arbor,” Boener said. 

Located near the corner of East 

Liberty Street and S. 4th Ave., 
Cinnaholic will be open 10 a.m. to 
9 p.m., seven days a week. Beyond 
their specialty cinnamon rolls, they 
also sell other desserts, including 
brownies and edible cookie dough. 
Their products are 100% vegan and 
allergen-friendly. 

Boener said she is looking forward 

to providing the community with 
another vegan food option. She 
said many people are surprised 
to learn the company’s cinnamon 
rolls are vegan when they first try 
them. 

“We want to be known as a 

really good cinnamon roll bakery, 
not just a vegan cinnamon roll 
bakery,” Boener said. 

Ann Arbor resident Elizabeth 

Wilkinson was first in line at 
Cinnaholic 
on 
opening 
day. 

Wilkinson said the event was 
exciting, even though it was cold 
outside, and she was looking forward 
to trying the half dozen cinnamon 
rolls she ordered. 

“I haven’t left my house in all of 

2022, and I had errands to run, so I 
figured, ‘Why not?’” Wilkinson said.

Wilkinson said she expects the 

bakery to do well among Ann Arbor 
customers. 

“I think the fact that it’s dairy 

free, that it’s vegan, I think it’s going 
to pull a lot of people,” Wilkinson 
said.

McMahan said she decided to 

report the incident to the Office of 
Institutional Equity — which was 
replaced in 2021 by the Equity, Civil 
Rights and Title IX Office — after 
she graduated. She said she waited 
until she was no longer a student 
to report Conforth so her ability to 
graduate would not be thrown into 
jeopardy. She said when she brought 
the emails between her and Conforth 
to Pamela Heatlie, the OIE senior 
director and Title IX coordinator at 
the time, Heatlie assured McMahan 
the allegations would be taken very 
seriously. McMahan said Heatlie 
then reached out to Conforth, asking 
him to corroborate McMahan’s 
account.

“Pam emailed me to tell me that 

Bruce 
corroborated 
the 
events 

and that the department and the 
University were taking all the 
necessary steps to ensure this 
wouldn’t happen again,” McMahan 
said. “But Bruce was allowed to keep 
teaching.”

Isabelle 
Brourman, 
a 
2015 

University graduate and another 

survivor of Conforth, alleged 

that the OIE had known about 
Conforth’s 
sexual 
harrassment 

and manipulation toward female 
students since 2008. 

Brourman said she first heard 

about Conforth freshman as a 
freshman in 2011 and met him in 
winter semester of her sophomore 
year in 2013. Brourman said going 
into her first year at the University, 
she knew Conforth’s classes were 
popular and often had long waitlists. 
She said she heard from other 
students that meeting with Conforth 
in person was the best way to try to 
get off the waitlist.

“(When) I nervously approached 

him about taking one of his courses, 
he stared at me and then told me 
he would see what he could do,” 
Brourman said. “Moments later, 

Bruce began the grooming process. 
He managed to find my Facebook 
account and sent me a friend request.”

Brourman said Conforth began 

contacting her from encrypted email 
accounts. Though she did not know 
he was the one sending her the emails 
until later, she said the anonymous 
sender claimed they were a powerful 
cult leader and threatened her safety 
if she did not allow Conforth to 
sexually abuse her. She said she took 
these threats seriously at the time.

“I was told that (the anonymous 

cult leaders) were watching me, that 
they might kill previous romantic 
partners and that I was required to 
sexually service Bruce as a way to 
keep not only myself safe, but to also 
prevent his death,” Brourman said.

In the summer of 2014, Brourman 

said 
she 
received 
an 
email 

threatening her life if she did not have 
sex with Conforth.

“This time I arrived at the 

University of Michigan not as a 
willing student, but as a helpless 
hostage,” Brourman said. “Bruce 
locked his office door and began to 
rape me.”

In 2016, Brourman and two other 

survivors filed Title IX reports to 
the OIE detailing Conforth’s abuse. 
Brourman said she was made 
aware that Heatlie was examining 
Conforth’s University email account 
at the time and found an explicit video 
Conforth had taken of Brourman. 
However, Brourman said Conforth 
allegedly told the OIE that she had 
consented to sexual interactions with 
him. After that, Brourman said OIE 
did not follow up with her about her 
Title IX report.

“When (Heatlie) asked (Conforth) 

about it, he, a 65-year-old instructor, 
told (her) that he and I, a 23-year-old 
former student, were in a committed 
and 
consensual 
relationship,” 

Brourman 
said. 
“I 
was 
never 

asked (about it). I was never even 
contacted by the OIE. OIE was the 
only lifeline I had, the only people 
or agency that was privy to reports 
about his violations, and (they) felt 

no obligation to inquire into my well 
being.”

Erickson said Brourman sent 

a Freedom of Information Act 
request to the University in June 
2021 to obtain several documents 
and emails pertaining to her Title 
IX report. Erickson said as of Jan. 
31, the University still has not 
responded to the FOIA requests. He 
said he worked with Brourman to file 
another FOIA lawsuit last week to 
pursue the documentation.

Erickson said she has been 

frustrated by the extent to which 
it seems sexual survivors have to 
advocate for themselves to receive 
any sort of justice. 

“(Survivors) need better support, 

they need to know that they’re not 
alone,” Erickson said. “They need 
to know that this isn’t happening 
in isolation. That is something that 
has to change at the University 
of Michigan, and frankly, other 
institutions in the state of Michigan 
and across the country.” 

In an email to the Michigan Daily 

on Monday, University spokesperson 
Rick Fitzgerald wrote Conforth was 
covered by a collective bargaining 
agreement which requires several 
actions be taken before an individual 
is terminated. Fitzgerald wrote 
the University took the necessary 
actions to ensure he had no contact 
with students prior to his resignation 
and that Conforth was not offered 
any compensation or benefits in 
exchange for his resignation.

“Mr. 
Conforth 
admitted 
to 

allegations of sexual misconduct 
that were made and a separation 
agreement outlined his permanent 
removal from the university, no 
contact with students and other 
requirements,” 
Fitzgerald 
wrote. 

“The university was prepared to 
initiate dismissal proceedings had he 
not first resigned.”

Fitzgerald wrote the University 

is committed to protecting students 
and community members from 
misconduct and has added new 
policies such as prohibiting student-

teacher romantic relationships to 
facilitate that goal.

“The university continues to 

take extraordinary measures to 
put critical protections in place 
for students and all members of 
our community on top of earlier 
protections,” Fitzgerald wrote. “We 
continue to work with the nationally 
recognized 
consulting 
firm 
of 

Guidepost Solutions on additional 
measures.”

Brourman also spoke on the 

history of silencing survivors at the 
University, including allegations in 
the Philbert and Anderson cases. She 
urged the University to take action 
and accountability for administrative 
sexual misconduct.

The University recently reached a 

settlement agreement with survivors 
of the late doctor Robert Anderson 
after 
15 
months 
of 
mediation 

between Anderson survivors and 
the University. The $490 million 
settlement follows months of protest 
and over 1,050 survivors coming 
forward with sexual misconduct 
allegations against Anderson.

Former University of Michigan 

President 
Mark 
Schlissel 
was 

terminated by the Board of Regents 
in early January after an internal 
investigation 
revealed 
he 
had 

been engaging in an inappropriate 
relationship 
with 
a 
University 

subordinate. Documents obtained 
from the Detroit Free Press reveal 
Schlissel could still return to the 
University this fall as a tenured 
professor due to a faculty tenure 
position he is entitled to under his 
initial contract with the University.

“Firing the President does not 

fix this issue,” Brourman said. 
“Changing a Title IX office while 
keeping the same administration and 
procedures in place does not fix this 
issue. Your empty, false messaging 
every time a new story comes out will 
not fix this issue. Tell the truth. Tell 
them what you allowed to happen to 
us.”

Though 
the 
center 
of 

campus is usually filled with 
students 
hurrying 
to 
classes, 

the University of Michigan Diag 
was uncharacteristically empty 
Wednesday afternoon. Only a 
handful of students bundled up 
with bulky jackets could be seen 
trudging through the six inches of 
snow that fell throughout the day 
Wednesday.

However, just after 7 p.m., the 

Diag was packed with about 300 
U-M students and thousands of 
airborne snowballs. It’s been almost 
exactly a year since the Diag was 
last transformed into a wintry 
battleground, proving once and for 
all that there’s nothing Wolverines 
love more than a good snowball 
fight.

The National Weather Service 

issued a winter storm warning 
for Washtenaw County and the 
surrounding area from 6 a.m. 
Wednesday to 10 p.m. Thursday. As 
a result, the Ann Arbor Public School 
district chose to conduct classes 
virtually through Friday and city 
offices and non-essential services 
closed as well. The University’s 
Ann Arbor campus remained open 
throughout the week, though the 
Dearborn and Flint campuses 
moved classes online. 

Nonetheless, campus building 

closures 
affected 
students 
on 

the U-M Ann Arbor campus as 
well. The Shapiro Undergraduate 

Library 
closed 
Wednesday 

evening at 8 p.m. rather than the 
usual 12 a.m. due to the inclement 
weather. The Martha Cook dining 
hall — which is only for residents 
of the building — also closed after 
lunch Wednesday due to staffing 
shortages, according to an email 
from Heather Guenther, director of 
communications for the Division of 
Student Life. All other dining halls 
across campus remained open. 

Students across campus also had 

to adjust to changes in course formats. 
While professors were allowed to 
hold classes in person, some chose 
to pivot to a hybrid or online format 
so commuting students could attend 
more easily. Art & Design sophomore 
Sarah Dettling said most of her classes 
were cancelled or moved online due 
to the weather Wednesday and 
Thursday. 

“The 
painting 
classes 
were 

cancelled because you can’t paint at 
home with oil paintings … and then 
the other ones were moved online,” 
Dettling said. “They were really short 
so it was basically just a snow day for 
me.”

LSA freshman Nilisha Baid said 

all of her classes were also moved 
online or were recorded. Baid said 
she felt it was easy to quickly switch 
to online classes since everyone had 
experience attending class online 
during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Having grown up in California, 
Baid also said was excited to enjoy a 
“snow day” on campus.

RESEARCH

ADMINISTRATION

The University of Michigan was 

ranked the top-funded institution 
in social science research in the 
U.S., according to the Fiscal Year 
2020 Higher Education Research 
and Development (HERD) Survey 
recently released by the National 
Science Foundation (NSF). The 
survey 
measures 
the 
annual 

research and development (R&D) 
spending by academic institutions 
across all academic disciplines. 

Higher 
education 
R&D 

expenditures increased 3.3% from 
the previous fiscal year to $86.4 
billion in total, according to the NSF 
report. Out of the 915 universities 
and colleges included in the survey, 
the University’s Ann Arbor campus 
ranked second in FY 2020 R&D 
expenditures in all fields.

Across all social science areas, 

the University topped the list with 
a $187 million R&D expenditure. It 
was also placed in the top 10 in five 
of the six social science subfields. 

The University is home to 

Institute 
for 
Social 
Research 

(ISR), the world’s largest academic 
social science survey and research 
organization. Dr. Kathleen Cagney, 
director of ISR, said the way funding 
works in ISR is entrepreneurial-like. 

ISR researchers receive grants from 
different agencies and foundations, 
rather than having funds be 
allocated by a committee. 

“Researchers come together and 

they develop their own research 
programs,” Cagney said. “They will 
write lots of different types of grants 
… that go to places like the National 
Institute of Health (NIH), the 
National Science Foundation (NSF) 
and other agencies.” 

Cagney also emphasized ISR’s 

role in creating the environment 
that 
values 
multidisciplinary 

research.

“One thing that makes (the 

University) distinctive (is) to have so 
many social science disciplines that 
are engaging in novel and cutting-
edge research,” Cagney said. “The 
intersection of disciplines (is) where 
novel research emerges.”

To get an idea of what kind of 

social science research is being done 
at the University, The Michigan 
Daily sat down with three social 
researchers to discuss their work 
and contributions to the field. 

Getting older in America
Funded by the National Institute 

of Aging and the Social Security 
Administration, the Health and 
Retirement Study (HRS) is a 
longitudinal study that collects 
survey data from a sample of 
approximately 20,000 people over 

the age of 50 in America every two 
years to understand the challenges 
and effects of aging. The survey 
asks participants about a wide 
range of topics from income, health, 
employment and lifestyle factors — 
all data that can be used for aging 
research. With high scientific 
productivity, HRS is now a model 
for longitudinal studies around the 
world.

David Weir, director of HRS, said 

the study began in 1992 in an effort 
to combine economic and health 
information of elderly population to 
help inform older generations.

“Our job is not to write the paper 

about the elderly,” Weir said. “Our 
job is to collect data and get it out for 

other people to use.”

Weir said HRS has maintained 

funding for 30 years, which is 
impressive for any longitudinal 
study. 

“The longitudinal studies often 

go for five to 10 years and that’s it,” 
Weir said. “So to go 30 years is pret-
ty unique and to do that, we have to 
have very innovative applications 
every time.”

Minority representation in the 

study is one area Weir said the HRS 
is focused on, especially since many 
of these groups are underrepresent-
ed in social science research.

“One of the things that we’ve 

become really valuable for is the 
representation of Blacks and His-

panics,” Weir said. “A lot of NIH 
studies don’t have much represen-
tation of those groups and they’re 
definitely understudied in terms of 
biomedical research. So that’s one 
of our strengths … (and) so we have 
innovations around adding differ-
ent cohorts of minority traditional 
minority disciplines.”

HRS also uses innovative strate-

gies to collect genetic informa-
tion for quantitative analysis. 
Weir said the DNA collection 
can be used to assess general 
risks for diabetes, alcoholism 
and mental illness, among other 
factors.

“What we are finding is that 

when you look across the whole 

genome, millions of pieces of 
information, you can find clusters 
of things that do predict higher 
risk,” Weir said. “So in terms of 
the connection of genetics to social 
science, we’re not (saying) ‘Here’s 
the gene for diabetes’, but we can 
give you a score based on that 
person’s whole genome of their 
relative risk of developing (the 
disease).”

Weir added that collaboration 

among epidemiologists, psycholo-
gists and other researchers to ana-
lyze data across different disciplines 
is vital to the project. Weir said that 
being at the University of Michi-

The Board of Regents fired 

former University of Michigan 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel 

effective immediately on Jan. 
15 
following 
a 
third-party 

investigation 
revealing 
an 

inappropriate 
relationship 

between 
Schlissel 
and 
a 

subordinate. The investigation 
— 
which 
uncovered 
over 

two years of emails and text 
messages 
between 
Schlissel 

and the unnamed subordinate 
— marked the end of a 
tumultuous presidency since 
he first took office in 2014. The 
Michigan Daily took a look 
back at events that happened 
during the Schlissel presidency, 
year by year.

This article represents a 

summary of Schlissel’s presi-
dency over the past eight years 
and is not representative of all 
events which took place during 
that time. 

2014: Students, faculty 

express excitement over the 
prospect of a new president

On Jan. 24, 2014 the Board 

of Regents and now-Interim 
President Mary Sue Coleman 
held a special meeting to 
announce that then-Brown 
University 
Provost 
Mark 

Schlissel 
would 
succeed 

Coleman as the University’s 
14th President. 

At the meeting, Schlissel 

said he hoped not to lead from 
the “top down,” but to listen 
to students and faculty first 
and foremost. 

“The best ideas come from 

the people who do the teach-
ing and the learning, so that’s 
why I need to do some listen-
ing first,” Schlissel said. 

Schlissel had served as 

Brown 
University 
Provost 

for three years and Dean 
of the Biological Sciences 
Department at the University 
of California-Berkeley from 
2008-2011. With an MD-PhD 
degree 
in 
physiological 

chemistry, Schlissel was a 
prominent 
researcher 
and 

continued to publish papers 
throughout 
his 
tenure 
at 

Berkeley and Brown. 

“(Research) 
was 
his 

life,” Kwan Chow, one of 
Schlissel’s former students 
at 
UC-Berkeley, 
told 
The 

Michigan Daily in 2014. “He 
ran a lab. Two years doing 
administrative 
work 
isn’t 

going to erase that.”

On Oct. 26, graduate stu-

dents at Brown University 
penned an open letter warn-
ing graduate students at The 
University of Schlissel’s com-
mitment to anti-labor and 
austerity while he was their 
provost. 

“We ask graduate students 

at the University of Michigan 
to join us in reminding Mark 
Schlissel 
about 
a 
central 

lesson of liberal thought: 
Academic freedom isn’t clean 
and quiet, and civil discourse 
isn’t polite and restrained,” 
the letter reads. “Not all great 
ideas with public value are 
profitable. When it comes 
to 
racism, 
sexism, 
labor 

exploitation, appropriation of 
public resources and overall 
devaluation of the people who 
work, teach and research for 
the classroom, there can’t and 
won’t be consensus.”

Schlissel’s 
appointment 

came after an over $315,000 
presidential 
search 
that 

spanned over eight months 
and was met with initial hope-
fulness from students and fac-
ulty. Dentistry professor Rex 
Holland, then-vice chair of 
the Senate Advisory Commit-
tee on University Affairs, said 
he was impressed with Schlis-
sel’s credentials and excited to 
see him lead the University. 

“I’m very impressed with 

President-elect 
Schlissel’s 

credentials,” Holland said at 
the SACUA meeting in 2014. 
“I have great confidence that 
President-elect Schlissel will 
be a splendid leader for a 
splendid institution.” 

Members of the Central 

Student Government in 2014 
were also pleased with the 
student-centric 
approach 

Schlissel displayed in his 
announcement address. 

“(Schlissel) 
mentioned 

working with students at 

every opportunity that he 
had,” then-CSG Vice Presi-
dent Bobby Dishell said at a 
2014 CSG meeting. “That’s 
something that we’re very 
much looking forward to, and 
every student should be very 
excited about.” 

Schlissel began his initial 

five-year appointment on July 
1, 2014, with an initial base 
salary of $750,000.

In September 2014 — just 

four months into his tenure 
as President — a graduate 
student launched a petition 
calling for the removal of 
then-athletic director David 
Brandon. 
Brandon 
was 

criticized 
by 
students 
for 

raising the price of student 
tickets and for the slump in 
student attendance to football 
games, as well as ignoring 
player safety concerns. The 
petition — which garnered 
over 10,000 signatories in just 
over 24 hours — came amid 
concern that Schlissel’s Ivy 
League 
background 
made 

him incapable of managing a 
Big 10 football team. Schlissel 
ultimately accepted Brandon’s 
resignation on Oct. 31, 2014. 

“Dave feels that it would 

be in the best interests of our 
student-athletes, the athletic 
department and the University 
community if he moved on to 
other challenges and allowed 
the important work of the 
department and the University 
to continue without daily dis-
tractions,” Schlissel said at a 
press conference announcing 
the resignation. 

2015 brings struggles with 

Fraternity 
and 
Sorority 

Life party culture, sexual 
misconduct in first year of 
presidency

Schlissel began his tenure 

as 
U-M 
President 
with 

several initiatives including 
streamlining 
sustainability 

and 
addressing 
sexual 

misconduct on campus.

In September, Schlissel met 

with members of all University 
FSL chapters to discuss alco-
hol abuse and sexual miscon-
duct – two issues he said ran 
rampant within Fraternity and 
Sorority Life. Schlissel said the 

excessive party culture deval-
ued the University’s reputation 
for academic excellence. 

“The 
value 
of 
(alumni) 

degrees are gonna go down 
because the reputation of the 
University of Michigan won’t 
be the excitement in the Big 
House or our teams doing well 
under our fantastic new coach 
(Jim 
Harbaugh),” 
Schlissel 

said. “It’s not gonna be the 
kids who receive the Rhodes 
Scholarships and the Ful-
bright Scholarships, and the 
famous professors who do the 
work that you’re going to get 
reflected on for or the National 
Medal for the Arts that our 
faculty won this past week. 
It’s going to be the ‘Shmacked’ 
videos. So it’s really up to you 
what the value of your educa-
tion is going to be, what the 
reputation of this institution’s 
going to be.”

Schlissel’s meeting marked 

the first time members of all 
FSL chapters gathered together 
in their over 170-year history. 

The University also intro-

duced Wolverine Pathways — a 
rigorous mentorship program 
for middle and high school stu-
dents that would eventually 
accumulate with full tuition — in 
October. Pathways was an initia-
tive to increase racial and socio-
economic diversity amongst the 
student body. 

“Inseparable from our efforts 

to enhance our academic excel-
lence as a public good is our work 
to improve diversity, equity and 
inclusion at the University of 
Michigan,” Schlissel said. “We 
cannot be excellent without 
being diverse, in the broadest 
sense of that word.”

2016 brings debate sur-

rounding free speech on cam-
pus

The 2016 election introduced 

a point of contention on cam-
pus. Following former President 
Donald Trump’s surprise victory 
on Nov. 8, Schlissel penned an 
email to the University com-
munity providing resources 
for students seeking support 
in the aftermath of the elec-
tion.

Political activists, scholars 

speak on learning from 

Native American thought, 

environmental impact

Symposium explores contributions of 

Indigenous knowledge, legal framework

The 
Eisenberg 
Institute 
for 

Historical Studies conducted an 
online event Friday afternoon to 
discuss the possibility of “radical 
futures” through an analysis of 
Indigenous political thought. 

Featuring four panelists, the 

symposium explored the contri-
butions of Indigenous knowledge, 
science and political thought. The 
event also focused on recognizing 
the importance of Indigenous peo-
ple for the future instead of simply 
framing them in the past.

The event opened with remarks 

from Mrinalini Sinha, event mod-
erator and director of the EIHS. 
Sinha said the EIHS has worked 
extensively to foster a setting where 
individuals can participate together 
in vigorous intellectual exchange, 
as displayed by this symposium and 
other discussions.

“The inspiration for this event 

was a part of our year-long theme 
of recovery,” Sinha said. “We were 
wanting to think about the future, 
but not in a kind of linear way but 
rather by overcoming events from 
the past. On the issue of climate 
justice, for example, more privi-
leged people probably think of the 
environmental disaster as a future 
event. But Indigenous people have 
watched the extinction of species 
and seen environmental disasters 
committed for centuries and have 
figured out ways to adapt to it, 
which we can learn from.”

Ana María León, assistant Art 

History professor, began with a 
discussion of the legal framework 
of Indigenous thought and said the 
Constitution gives people the ability 
to litigate the ecosystem on behalf 
of their personal gain, which con-
sequently leads to environmental 
degradation.

“Environmental entities should 

realistically give people the abil-
ity to advocate for their environ-
ment and outdoor space,” León said. 
“However their actions, both on the 
left and right, are solely political. … 
The vast resources of capital that 
could be used to protect the envi-
ronment have no bearing if the state 
decides to go another way.”

Sinha 
then 
redirected 
the 

conversation to Rebecca D. Hardin, 
associate professor at U-M’s School 
of Environment and Sustainability. 
Hardin, who has conducted research 
in South Africa, said her work was eye 
opening, particularly her analysis of 
the Royal Bafokeng Nation.

“When I saw the inner workings 

of the Bafokeng Nation, I was in awe,” 
Hardin said. “The champagne flutes 
and Christian Dior suits were a deft 
and creative combination of not only 
their sartorial forms but also their 
governance form … these strategic 
acts are in danger of colonial roman-
ticization.”

Kyle Whyte, a professor in the 

School of Environment and Sustain-
ability, then spoke on his work in the 
climate change sector of Indigenous 
people.

“All that the term climate change 

indicates, is that people who have been 
sheltered against colonialism now think 
that they may have something to lose,” 
Whyte said. “But, (Indigenous people) 
have faced years and years of climate 
and environmental chaos that we 
have adapted to and if these methods 
are employed, people may not lose as 
much as they think.”

When asked about land defense 

strategies and government change, 
Whyte said it is relevant to compare 
the past and the present. He shared 
information about a tribe in Okla-
homa in the early 20th century, the 
same tribe’s situation today and his 
perspective on what should be done in 
response to the changes.

“The tribes were dealing with envi-

ronmental change that they didn’t 
cause, and their lands were in the 
process of being liquidated,” Whyte 
said. “Land was going unstewarded 
and the U.S. government was forcing 
them to adopt democratic processes. 
We’re engaging in land defense, seek-
ing to take back our government and 
make our own decisions about tech-
nology infrastructure.”

David Myer Temin, assistant 

professor in political science, said 
his side of the discussion aligned 
with an overview of the Land 
Back Movement — a movement 
aiming to return ownership of 
Indigenous lands to Indigenous 
communities.

Everyone grows up. It’s the inevi-

table consequence of life ticking for-
ward one second at a time, but just 
because we grow up doesn’t mean we 
are grown-ups. We all come of age dis-
tinctly, surrounded by different people 
and existing in different circumstances, 
but we are united in the fact that grow-
ing up sucks. It’s a beautiful, disgusting, 
painful, euphoric process that asks us 
to strip ourselves bare, raw and vulner-
able before building us back into the 
person we are meant to become. Like 
every other difficult experience in life, 
the best way to explore coming of age 
is through art. This B-Side is a gallery 
walk through eight wonderful writers 
as they explore where coming of age 
intersected with their lives.

The enormity of 17 has no space for 

sickness by Managing Arts Editor Lil-
lian Pearce

Seventeen is the idolized coming-of-

age age. It’s not representative of a num-
ber necessarily but of a concept. The idea 
of 17 has been explored and exploited in 

Hollywood since 1965 — “You are six-
teen going on seventeen / baby it’s time 
to think / Better beware, be canny and 
careful / Baby, you’re on the brink.” Sev-
enteen is notable because it’s between 
two symbolic ages in American culture.

‘Big Mouth’ puts the ‘coming’ in 

‘coming of age’ by Daily Arts Contribu-
tor Maya Levy

Created by childhood best friends 

Nick Kroll (“Kroll Show”) and Andrew 
Goldberg (“Family Guy”), the series is 
a profane retelling of their own experi-
ences in middle school — acne scars and 
all. Now in its fifth season, the series 
has developed a complex cast of tweens 
accompanied by an array of personified, 
monstrous pubescent emotions. Where 
most coming-of-age stories show how 
things might get worse before they get 
better, in “Big Mouth,” things just keep 
getting worse, forcing us to endure the 
extreme (and often graphic) truths of 
puberty.

The older I get, the less I like hind-

sum of all of our past selves, that self-
reflection is healthy and so on. Howev-
er, there are moments when I think back 
to some of the things I wore or liked or 
did or believed when I was younger and 
I vow to never reminisce again. When

I’m forced to recognize that I was prob-
ably a pretty fucking unbearable teen-

Better known as “sylly week,” the

condone their laziness and theoretically 
couldn’t yet be behind. For some stu-
dents, it’s purgatory at worst, party time 
at best. For me, though, sylly week (and 
its single day high school equivalent) is 
misery. Every semester, I feel as if I am 
staring up a mountain, lacking both the

I’ll get a book recommendation once a

content hating on J.D. Salinger’s “Catch-

Holden Caulfield. After seeing so many 
nearly identical angry takes, I caved. I

The Coming-of-Age B-Side

My own Mr. Keating: Why I love ‘Dead Poets Society’

“I went to the woods because I 

wanted to live deliberately. I wanted 
to live deep and suck out all the mar-
row of life. To put to rout all that was 
not life; and not, when I had come to 
die, discover that I had not lived.”

I first watched “Dead Poets 

Society” my junior year of high 
school; its poster taunted me, sit-
ting unwatched in my watchlist. 
When one of my classmates learned 
I had never seen it before, she was 
outraged. “Why not?! Your mom is 
an English teacher, for crying out 
loud!” I watched it shortly after and 
loved it, just as she knew I would. 
I then recommended it to another 
friend who hadn’t seen it, who came 

up to me days later and told me it 
made him cry.

At the prestigious preparatory 

school Welton Academy, a group of 
young students is inspired by their 
new English teacher, John Keat-
ing (Robin Williams, “The Angri-
est Man in Brooklyn”). It is under 
Keating’s direction that the boys 
discover the beauty of poetry, resur-
recting the Dead Poets Society — a 
club which Keating founded when 
he himself was a student at Wel-
ton. Through their newfound love 
of words, the boys learn to think 
for themselves and pursue their 
own passions, much to the chagrin 
of their parents and school’s more 
conservative administration. Fea-
turing Peter Weir’s beautiful shots 
of New England autumn and a score 
by Maurice Jarre that I can only 

describe as nostalgic, this movie has 
become a comfort film for me, even 
though it breaks my heart with-
out fail. The film became a staple 
at movie nights; my close circle of 
friends never got tired of it despite 
the countless rewatches (though our 
varying interpretations of its mes-
sage have caused debate). We fell in 
love with the wholesome charac-
ters, laughing at their teenage antics 
and cheering when they stood up 
for themselves. But what left a last-
ing impact on me was Williams’ 
performance, mixing humor with 
kindness and encouragement as a 
classroom role model.

It only makes sense then that we 

would see our senior year English 
teacher as our very own Mr. Keat-
ing.

If Mr. McNally was the uncon-

ventional Keating, then the beige 
walls of my Catholic high school 
were the uninspiring grounds of 
Welton. I don’t mean to bash any-
one, because I enjoyed my time in 
that building; the ways that Mr. 
McNally structured his classes and 
treated us students simply felt dif-
ferent than all of my other teach-
ers at the time. His lectures were 
much more similar to a college-style 
seminar — he preferred fostering 
discussion to reading off a Power-
Point word-for-word while we sat 
in silence, copying notes. We may 
not have been ripping pages out of 
our textbooks like the students do in 
the movie, but discussing whether 
Charles Ryder and Sebastian Flyte 
were gay for each other in Evelyn 
Waugh’s “Brideshead Revisited” 
gave us a similar thrill. Like Keating, 

he encouraged us to do more than 
simply memorize information and 
regurgitate it into an essay. For our 
circles of hell projects while reading 
Dante’s “Inferno,” students came 
in with colorful posters, LEGO 
dioramas and even a Minecraft 
server. McNally was mischievous: 
He admitted to us that he would 
mess with Wikipedia pages so that 
he could tell when a student hadn’t 

done proper research. Instead of 
detentions he made us write lines 
as punishment, only to rip them up 
when we handed them in the next 
day. “You waste my time, I’ll waste 
yours,” he’d say. (I never had to write 
any, but walking into class and see-
ing a sentence on the board was 
amusing.)

Crying in a car alone: 

Coming of age just like in 

the movies

“And I had a feeling that I belonged. 

I had a feeling I could be someone.”

As this quote from Tracy Chap-

man’s “Fast Car” evokes in its mag-
nificent and haunting chorus, there is 
something about flying along in a car 
that makes you feel like you can leave 
what you know behind and do any-
thing. While the narrator of this song 
does not drive the car herself, it is still 
the object that both literally carries 
her away from home and figuratively 
carries her into a new chapter of her 
life. One where she belongs. One 
where she can “be someone.” Like 
so many songs and stories describe, 
my coming of age coincided with the 
time I learned to drive.

It was my junior year of high 

school. I spent a great deal of time 
learning how to make a left turn 
across an intersection in less than a 
full minute and sitting in a classroom 
watching obligatory videos about 
how quickly you would die if you hit 
a tree going 55 miles an hour. When 
I got my license, I was apprehensive, 
having come to the conclusion that 
the only way to be safe was to live 
underground — far from any roads, 
for the rest of my life. While overcom-
ing the fear instilled in me from Driv-
er’s Ed, I was also facing another fear: 
My best friend had gone to Sweden 
as a foreign exchange student, leav-
ing me to realize how few truly close 
friends I had. Just as I was experienc-
ing driving alone for the first time, I 
was experiencing an increased loneli-
ness in the rest of my life.

I don’t think that you can “come 

of age” without spending time 
alone, a theory supported by popu-
lar media. Look at Olivia Rodrigo’s 
2021 song “drivers license,” in which 
she drives alone past places she once 
thought she would drive with her 
ex-boyfriend, taking away some of 
the power these places — and the 
breakup — hold over her. Or take 
Greta Gerwig’s 2017 film “Lady Bird,” 

where punky teenager Lady Bird 
(Saoirse Ronan, “Little Women”) 
finally leaves Sacramento for college 
in New York City. Only after leaving 
her best friend and family and expe-
riencing the freedom of being alone, 
hooking up with a sophisticated man 
she hardly knows and getting so 
drunk that she ends up in a hospital, 
does Lady Bird realize she needs to 
change. In the final scene, she calls 
and leaves a message for her parents. 
She addresses her mom, asking if she 
felt emotional the first time she drove 
through Sacramento, because despite 
having known the city for her whole 
life, it felt different when Lady Bird 
first drove through it herself. It is in 
this final scene where she first calls 
herself by her given name, Christine, 
rather than using the moniker she 
chose for herself. Being alone for the 
first time intersects with her accep-
tance of her identity as her mother’s 
daughter, despite their strained rela-
tionship.

Unfortunately for me, junior year 

of high school was not an ideal time 
for isolation. I had a crush on some-
one and was too afraid of rejection 
to act on it. I instead fell down a pit of 
insecurities when hiding my feelings 
didn’t make anyone fall in love with 
me. I convinced myself that I was 
not good enough in any way, be that 
my personality, of which I was cer-
tain I had none, or my body. I became 
closed-off from the friends who were 
still there because I felt they didn’t 
care about me. The truth was, they 
didn’t know anything was wrong 
because I never said anything about 
it. I had never been one to talk much 
about my feelings, and until that year, 
that had felt like a strength. Suddenly, 
this trait isolated me and convinced 
me I had no one to talk to if I wanted 
to. Reflection makes it seem impossi-
ble that I let these very junior-year-of-
high-school problems devastate me 
as much as they did. We’ve all been 
there. (Please tell me we’ve all been 
there.)

About a year ago, I ran into 

an old friend during the com-
mute home from one of my 
classes. Given the state of the 
world in 2021, that commute 
was, of course, entirely vir-
tual, and consisted merely of 
moving a cursor from the big 
red “Leave Meeting” button 
on Zoom to the power down 
button on the Windows start 
menu. But during my cursor’s 
brief virtual transit across the 
screen, it passed by a familiar 
face, somehow unchanged in 
the years since we’d first met: 
the “Minecraft” launcher icon.

It had been at least a year 

since I had played or thought 
about “Minecraft,” and on that 
day, I was eager to jump back in. 

The game was a huge part of my 
childhood, so I was hoping to 
recapture a piece of my youth. 
Yet, for as much as I remember 
loving it, the gameplay didn’t 
captivate me like it once did. 
Despite the amount of time that 
had passed since I last played 
“Minecraft,” I still remem-
bered exactly how to progress, 
which incidentally made my 
achievements feel trivial. It’s 
hard not to compare this lack-
luster experience to my Her-
culean memory of my younger 
self, 
whose 
existence 
was 

largely defined by overcoming 
the game’s various obstacles. 
I sped through the beginning 
of the game with ease, but my 
playthrough ended abruptly — 
not because I made a mistake in 
the game, but because I pushed 
the technical capabilities of my 
underpowered laptop too far. 

By attempting to load into the 
Nether Dimension, I tanked 
the game’s graphical perfor-
mance and allowed a low-level 
enemy to kill me before I could 
even see it. I pushed the game 
to its limits; I broke it, and it 
broke me. Frustrated and dis-
appointed, I closed the game 
for what remains, to this day, 
the final time.

Even though I was disap-

pointed by the gameplay of 
“Minecraft” during my last 
playthrough, something else 
unexpectedly captivated me: 
the music, composed by Dan-
iel Rosenfeld (a.k.a. C418). I 
had never cared much for the 
soundtrack 
of 
“Minecraft,” 

but when I first heard the mel-
low piano arpeggio of C418’s 
“Wet Hands” fade in on my 
most recent playthrough, I was 
immediately transported from 

soulless, 
resource-gathering 

gameplay to another realm, 
one far beyond the menial 
tasks (both in the game and in 
real life) that kept me tethered 
down to this temporal dimen-
sion. I was instantly lost in 
ancient memories of the game, 
memories I didn’t even know I 
had. Within my mind, I casu-
ally meandered between entire 
years of my life: I had become 
unstuck in time. I remembered 
the first few times I played 
the game, coming home from 
school 
and 
building 
grand 

buildings on my own in creative 
mode. I remembered staying up 
late to play survival mode with 
friends and the genuine fear 
we felt as we slayed monsters. 
I even remembered the lone-
lier later years, returning to 
playing by myself as my friends 
slowly lost interest in the game, 

just before I did too.

 

‘Minecraft’ gave us the soundtrack to a generation

‘Big Mouth’ puts the 

‘coming’ in coming of age

Hindsight is 20/20: A look back on ‘(500) Days of 

Summer’

The coming-of-age trope has 

been a classic for centuries, con-
sistently employed in film, televi-
sion and literature to fill our hearts 
with the nostalgic saga of matura-
tion. The bildungsroman — liter-
ally “novel of education” — serves 
as a glowing example of personal 
growth, recounting downfalls and 
mistakes from which one learns and 
matures into a better person. The 
archetypal bildungsroman often 
romanticizes this journey, down-
playing the painstaking process 
of growing up. For example, “The 
Perks of Being a Wallflower” glo-
riously uplifts a socially awkward 
freshman to a life of enjoyment and 
discovery. The story has its down 
moments, but they are ultimately 
smothered by a more powerful joie 
de vivre. Even “Little Women,” a 
narrative full of family tragedy and 
painful young love, is told in beau-

tiful detail and ends with ultimate 
success. “Call Me By Your Name,” 
“The Breakfast Club,” “The Princess 
Bride” — all these classic coming-of-
age stories tell us that life will be 
beautiful if we can just get through 
a couple of awkward moments. Net-
flix’s television series “Big Mouth” 
tells a different story. 

Created 
by 
childhood 
best 

friends Nick Kroll (“Kroll Show”) 
and Andrew Goldberg (“Family 
Guy”), the series is a profane retell-
ing of their own experiences in 
middle school — acne scars and all. 
Now in its fifth season, the series 
has developed a complex cast of 
tweens accompanied by an array of 
personified, monstrous pubescent 
emotions. Where most coming-of-
age stories show how things might 
get worse before they get better, in 
“Big Mouth,” things just keep get-
ting worse, forcing us to endure the 
extreme (and often graphic) truths 
of puberty.

The older I get, the less I like hind-

sight. I know that since we’re only 
the sum of all of our past selves, that 
self-reflection is healthy and so on. 
However, there are moments when 
I think back to some of the things I 
wore or liked or did or believed when 
I was younger and I vow to never 
reminisce again. When I think back, 
especially to high school, I’m forced 
to recognize that I was probably a 
pretty fucking unbearable teenager. 
This is a relatively easy thing to for-
give — I think I’d be hard-pressed to 
find an adult who’s especially fond 
of their high school self — but some-
times looking back genuinely makes 
me mad.

My coming of age was a clumsy 

one. I was frequently so wrapped 
up in my fixation of the month that 
I forgot to develop any sense of self-
awareness. My conceptions of life 
and love and all of the Big Stuff were 

more heavily informed by those fixa-
tions than by my actual experiences. 
I loved the ideas of things more than 
I could possibly love them for what 
they actually were.

One of those fixations— and a foun-

dational text for my understanding of 
love — was “(500) Days of Summer,” a 
rom-com but not a love story. It warns 
us of this right from the beginning 
by way of a golden-throated, omni-
scient narrator (Richard McGonagle, 
“Regular Show”) whose matter-of-
fact commentary bookends the film. 
As impressionable as I was, I don’t 
know if I was ever really convinced 
that it was a love story, if only for the 
simple fact that the couple at its cen-
ter don’t end up together. My biggest 
takeaway, though, was always the 
protagonist Tom’s (Joseph Gordon-
Levitt, “Mr. Corman”) romanticism: 
his belief in fate and certain absolute 
truths about love. I never registered 
that those things were doomed to 
keep him from learning anything 
substantive about himself or how he 
conducts himself in relationships. 

Rather, I figured they were things to 
strive for and emulate.

I can’t be too hard on my younger 

self for that, though; “(500) Days of 
Summer” is sort of a deceptive film. 
Its suggestions of Tom’s inalterable 

idealism-to-a-fault are subtle enough 
to go over the heads of people more 
intelligent than 17-year-old me. In her 
defense, though, the ending is played 

like a happy one. When the 500 days 
that revolve around the titular Sum-
mer (Zooey Deschanel, “New Girl”) 
inevitably come to a close, he meets 
a woman, aptly named Autumn 
(Minka Kelly, “Titans”), and a recur-

ring intertitle marking the days ticks 
from “500” back down to “1.”

Hot take: I hate syllabus week. 
Better known as “sylly week,” the 

first week of college classes in a semes-
ter is often referenced affectionately as 
the final week in which a student could 
condone their laziness and theoretically 
couldn’t yet be behind. For some stu-
dents, it’s purgatory at worst, party time 
at best. For me, though, sylly week (and 
its single day high school equivalent) is 
misery. Every semester, I feel as if I am 
staring up a mountain, lacking both the 
desire and proper equipment to climb.

I remember the first day of junior 

year of high school the most clearly. As 
I moved from classroom to classroom, 
one uncomfortable metal chair to the 
next, each of my teachers told me they 
“meant business” and droned on about 
the seemingly unending list of assign-
ments I would face. Each one felt like 
another stone dropped in my hiking 
backpack. By the end of the day, I hadn’t 
even begun the trek to the top but I had 
collapsed under the weight of the stones 
regardless.

I escaped to the solace of my room. 

The walls had recently been painted 
gray to cover the aqua and lavender opti-
mism of my youth and now generated 
the visual equivalent of white noise. I 
had many thoughts that afternoon, but I 
remember only one: the day was exactly 
as bad as I thought it would be. I sought 
comfort then, as I had on many other 
desperate occasions, in “The Perks of 

Being a Wallflower.” The Tumblr-esque 
film was chock-full of the aesthetic I 
so admired in my teenage years while 
excluding the excessive chain-smoking 
of the eponymous novel that so discom-
forted me before my exposure to my 
own chosen vices. 

Although my attraction was (and still 

is) to Sam (Emma Watson, “Return to 
Hogwarts”), I didn’t know yet that it 
was the soft touch of another woman’s 
lips I yearned for. I wanted to love her, 
be loved by her and, most of all, to be 
her, but it was Charlie (Logan Lerman, 
“Fury”) in whom I most saw myself. I 
felt his loneliness, his tears and I knew 
exactly what he meant when he said he 
was “both happy and sad … and trying 
to figure out how that could be.” I saw 
Charlie’s depression play out on screen, 
giving me the permission I needed to 
process my feelings, though I didn’t yet 
have a name for those feelings that we 
shared. 

When Sam offered Charlie a drink 

and said, “welcome to the Island of 
Misfit Toys,” I hoped for the day that 
I would be offered a similar sense of 
belonging. When Patrick (Ezra Miller, 
“Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find 
Them”) read aloud, “Chapter One: sur-
viving your fascist shop teacher who 
needs to put kids down to feel big,” and 
then added, “Oh wow, this is useful guys 
we should read on,” I cracked a smile — 
even on my darkest day. When Sam and 
Patrick implored Charlie to write a book 
about them and call it “the Slut and the 
Falcon,” I imagined possible plotlines 
that the book could have. When Sam and 

Charlie kissed under the fairy lights to 
ensure that the first person to ever kiss 
Charlie would be someone who truly 
loved him, I wished my first kiss had 
been so picturesque and kind but decid-
ed not to abandon all hope that my next 
could be. 

Years passed and I had not seen this 

film in a long time. Not for lack of try-
ing, but when I attempted to watch it, 
it generated the opposite sensations it 
once did. Rather than feeling like I was 
wrapped in a warm blanket, I experi-
enced the profound discomfort of an 
itchy sweater. I wouldn’t last 20 minutes. 
I started skipping over scenes, dragging 
the cursor past minutes of dialogue that 
used to mean everything to me in hopes 
that I might be able to enjoy the rest of 
it, just a little. Still, I could hardly bear 
to look, and I know why: I felt ashamed 
of the person I used to be and Char-
lie reminded me too much of her. I had 
grown enough that I no longer was that 
person, but not enough to forgive her. 
The phase of my life where Charlie was 
my closest friend was characterized by 
unrelenting self-loathing, not the least 
of which was centered around my frus-
tration at feeling such seemingly unex-
plainable sadness. I couldn’t banish 
those feelings, and I felt it should have 
been easy to do so. It wasn’t. 

I can’t really say what finally enabled 

me to watch the film. There wasn’t one 
wonderful movie therapist who changed 
my life in a session, a breakup that final-
ly woke me up inside or a rock bottom I 
hit that spurred me to change (although 
I hit many). They say that you can’t love 

another person if you don’t love your-
self, and I’m here to tell you that that’s 
not even a little bit true. Even when I 
had little but contempt for myself, the 

love I felt for the important people in 
my life never wavered. But, it is true 
that when you’re at peace with yourself, 
you can love others best. I wasn’t ini-
tially inspired to get better out of love 
for myself, but because I wanted to give 
the best love possible to the people I care 
about. I realized that as my current self, 
I wasn’t doing that. Even if you don’t 
start off doing it for yourself, what mat-
ters is that you started in the first place. 
Only once I realized that I could simul-
taneously not be particularly fond of the 
person I once was and also proud of her 

for growing into the person I am now, 
did it become possible for me to enjoy my 
favorite movie again. 

About a month ago, I tweeted (or won-

dered aloud for all the internet to hear) if 
being the same version of myself around 
each of my loved ones, even those that 
did not associate with each other, was 
self-actualization in action. In the same 
hour, I tweeted that I can’t believe Wil-
lem Dafoe is a real name, so how much 
I have matured is certainly in ques-
tion, but how much I have grown is not 
(especially because I finally put an app 
time limit on my Twitter). Today, for the 
sake of journalism, I watched the film. 
I didn’t skip any scenes; I didn’t look 
away. It felt like a hug from an old friend.

Self-Love and ‘The Perks of Being a Wallflower’

Lessons on loss: A defense of Holden Caulfield

The enormity of 17 has no space for sickness 

My TikTok feed has only ever 

dabbled in the literary subgenre 
of BookTok. I’ll get a book recom-
mendation once a month, at most. 
But for whatever reason, I get a dis-
proportionate amount of content 
hating on J.D. Salinger’s “Catcher 
in the Rye.” Some creators criti-
cize the work as a whole; others 
go to great lengths to tear apart 
its protagonist, Holden Caulfield. 
After seeing so many nearly identi-
cal angry takes, I caved. I bought a 
used copy of “Catcher” to re-read 
it and get to the bottom of why so 
many grown adults were insistent 
on verbally berating a fictional 
16-year-old.

No doubt, Holden’s narration 

style is annoying. The first couple 
pages alone left me both frustrated 
and amazed with the ratio of “god-
dam” and “hell” to all other words. 
Holden’s hypercritical and cyni-
cal scope of viewing the external 
world was also quite jarring, which 
should say a lot considering I have 
edited my fair share of Daily Arts’s 
most cutting reviews over the last 
two years.

While these hurdles were fairly 

quick to adjust to, Holden’s con-
trarianism and emotional stag-
nation made the novel lack the 
satisfaction of other coming-of-
age works in which the reader or 
viewer can witness the adolescent 
protagonist mature before their 
very eyes. It’s easy to enjoy the 

coming-of-age catharsis of high 
school students realizing the arbi-
trariness of cliques and cultivating 
friendships across them (à la “The 
Breakfast Club”) but Holden’s situ-
ation is simply incomparable. As 
I read more, though, I made it to a 
crucial scene that I hadn’t remem-
bered, and that the TikTokers had 
conveniently omitted. In a passing 
but vivid vignette, Holden recalls 
the pain of his younger brother’s 
passing before abruptly distract-
ing himself with other ideas — a 
behavior and narration device that 
quickly becomes as ingrained as his 
excessive crassness.

Holden yearns to tell the reader 

about his late brother Allie, and he 
does so sporadically through sto-
ries that always seem prematurely 
cut off. While his narration style 
can be choppy in general, these 
abrupt endings typically come at 
especially emotional moments and 
reflect overwhelmedness rather 
than merely a short attention span. 
The bulk of Holden’s coming of 
age takes place three years before 
“Catcher” does, with Allie’s pass-
ing. The novel itself reflects the 
aftermath of a child forced to deal 
with a level of trauma that can 
plague adults indefinitely. Risking 
banality, Holden came of age too 
soon.

Salinger’s depiction of loss is a 

realistic one, with the goal being 
merely surviving rather than thriv-
ing. When I read “Catcher” in high 
school this wasn’t clear to me, but 
my recent revisit came in the same 
year as the loss of a close friend. 

And I’m not ashamed to say, I saw 
some of Holden’s grieving habits 
and mentalities reflected in myself.

The role of distraction in Hold-

en’s psyche often resonated with 
me. Just as he could only remi-
nisce about memories of Allie in 
small doses, I could not linger on 
my own memories for too long at a 
time, giving his erratic recollection 
some clarity. It was not as though I 
consciously chose to stop reminisc-
ing — my brain would only let me 
produce a few moments at a time, 
perhaps as subconscious self care.

Holden’s relationship with dis-

traction in a broader sense per-
vades the novel in a way akin to 
its role in my own coping toolbox. 
Sometimes, Holden is met with a 
wave of sudden restlessness and 
disdain for his existence, and he 
decides he needs to do something 
— anything to get his mind off it. 
It could be the middle of the night, 
but if Holden needs to wander and 
look for a task, he doesn’t hesitate. 
“Night walks” have become a part 
of my vocabulary in a similar man-
ner. Sometimes that deep restless-
ness sets in when I wish I could be 
sleeping and, knowing I won’t be 
able to sleep anyway, I’ll wander 
around to see if there’s anything 
new I can notice. If there’s some 
happy thoughts I can think. Re-
reading “Catcher” has made me 
even more willing to act on these 
task cravings. Holden has his fair 
share of bad takes, but he’s right 
that it’s never good to lay and sim-
mer with negative thoughts.

In terms of his worldview itself, 

I would be wrong to omit Hold-
en’s feelings about phonies. While 
“hell” and “goddam” would likely 
rank first and second in their fre-
quency within the novel, bronze 
would have to go to “phony.” Hold-
en will call anybody and everybody 
who he is not willing to emotionally 
connect to a phony. Sure, he spins 
this as judgment and spite toward 
their interests and personalities, 
but this labeling and distancing is 
more emblematic of dealing with, 
and consequently deeply fearing, 
loss.

The depths of grief make enjoy-

ing many things unrealistic. A 
surface-level conversation with a 
friend or a cheesy comedy may do 
absolutely nothing to raise spirits 
or even distract one. Even more 
so, your friends’ inability to perk 
you up by any fraction can serve to 
antagonize you altogether. Some of 
Holden’s lowest lows came at times 
when hopeful distractions failed to 
do their job. These disappointments 
hurt. A lot. It always felt like a major 
setback when I finally worked up 
the drive to follow through on a 
plan, and it did nothing for me emo-
tionally. While I wouldn’t person-
ally use Holden’s vernacular, seeing 
other people find joy from situa-
tions that brought me none could 
feel inauthentic, phony.

The magnitude of this phony-

menon, if you will, is amplified 
through behind-the-scenes cop-
ing mechanisms. I’ve spent this 
past year feeling vulnerable. And 
below his paper-thin, abrasive 
facade, Holden is vulnerable too. 

For months I couldn’t imagine los-
ing someone I was close to, some-
one I cared about, again. And you 
can’t lose someone close to you if 
you don’t let them in or connect 
with them. As maladaptive as it is, 
it’s technically true. While I’m not 
sure if I could handle another loss 
right now, at least I’m getting better 
at re-learning how to let people in, 
and I’d like to think Holden has it in 
him to re-learn this himself.

Before I leave you to maybe 

revisit the book, allow me to para-
phrase an internal monologue that 
cements “Catcher” as a quintessen-
tial coming-of-age story, if nothing 
else does. Holden recalls his numer-
ous visits to the Museum of Natural 
History and the various exhibits 
within it. He finds deep comfort 
in the fact that the exhibits remain 
constant with each visit, even as 
he changes. He acknowledges that 
these changes in himself may not 

always be robust — in fact they may 
seem insignificant at times. Even 
still, these changes and morsels 
of character growth exist and are 
fulfilling for Holden to reflect on 
against the stable scenery. 

As chaotic of a character as he 

seems, Holden just wants a sem-
blance of stability while he grows. 
It’s not the growing up itself Hold-
en wishes to avoid but the lasting 
changes to his surroundings that 
come with it. More concisely, he 
doesn’t want to lose the people and 
situations external to him in order 
to grow internally. We all wish we 
could have the merits of growing 
up without the ongoing hardships 
from which the lessons stem. Rath-
er than getting bogged down hating 
Holden Caulfield and his numerous 
arbitrary internal tirades, we need 
to remember where his shortcom-
ings came from and will ourselves 
to move on where he could not.

Seventeen is the idolized 

coming-of-age age. It’s not rep-
resentative of a number neces-
sarily but of a concept. The idea 
of 17 has been explored and 
exploited in Hollywood since 
1965 — “You are sixteen going 
on seventeen / baby it’s time to 
think / Better beware, be canny 
and careful / Baby, you’re on 
the brink.” Seventeen is notable 
because it’s between two sym-
bolic ages in American culture. 
At 16, you’re given a taste of the 
future that awaits you; getting 
your driver’s license is less of 
an obligation and more like a 
rite of passage. A license means 
freedom, it means power, it 
means control over your life. 
It’s the peak of the romanticiza-
tion of adulthood. It’s an intoxi-
cating age, and it all leads up 
to 18, when these dreams and 
manifestations can be realized 
because you are now, legally if 
not mentally, an adult. 

Seventeen seems far from 

both of these vital ages. I felt a 
bigger distance between 16 and 
17 than I had with other ages. I 
felt old — too old for high school 
yet too young for any substan-
tial life changes. I certainly 

didn’t want to be 16 anymore, 
but I was equally certain that I 
didn’t want to be 18, either. I was 
trying hard to avoid change, but 
it was occurring incessantly: 
There was no escaping the col-
lege search or impending SATs. 
I could feel the future breathing 
down my neck, and I shuddered 
at its uncomfortable warmth. I 
didn’t find any solace in looking 
back at the past either, most-
ly because there was nothing 
there for me anymore. Seven-
teen erases nostalgia but fails 
to replace it with anything else. 

This depressing understand-

ing of 17 is only one side of the 
coin; the other is much more 
enticing. The fresh start hang-
ing in front of your face is tan-
talizing. 
Though 
uncertain, 

17 offers the chance to chase 
something new, to ride the high 
of the break in expectations, to 
explore a new side of yourself, 
all of which was not lost on me. 
Avril Lavigne’s “17” captures 
this essence of the age per-
fectly. She sings: “We were on 
top of the world / Back when I 
was your girl / We were living 
so wild and free / Acting stupid 
for fun / All we needed was love 
/ That’s the way it’s supposed to 
be / 17.” This 17 is unrestrained, 
unlimited and compelling. The 
world is right in front of you, 

you can go anywhere you want 
to go, and you can be anything 
you want to be. It’s not yet time 
for the hard decisions; real-
ity can be suspended for a little 
while longer. 

As an anxious person, the 

unrestrained possibility of 17 
was not particularly enticing 
to me — it was nauseating. The 
suspension of reality made me 
feel lost. Instead of enjoying 
the delight of avoiding big deci-
sions, I was stuck in a constant 
loop of said decisions: Where 
would I go to college? Did I 
want to be close to or far from 
my family? What do I want to 
do with my life? Should I even 
go to college with no plan in 
sight? Why does this make me 
upset? 

“Heathers: 
The 
Musical” 

explores the ambiguity of 17. 
Neither of the protagonists 
are enjoying their age; instead, 
they’re 
singing 
about 
how 

they’re desperate to be “nor-
mal” teenagers that “sneak a 
beer and watch TV.” Although 
the circumstance they’re in 
deserves acknowledgment of 
its absurdity, the sentiment 
remains: “Can’t we be seven-
teen? Is that so hard to do?” It is 
hard to be 17, and not only when 
you’re in a relationship with a 
serial killer.

Though the thought of inch-

ing closer to adulthood was 
scary for me, I decided I would 
embrace the glamour of 17 and 
use it as a time to explore who 
I was and the things I wanted. 
For two months, I embodied 
this side of 17 to a T. I made 
lists of potential colleges, I 
researched the best college 
towns, I enjoyed commitment-
free relationships and I spent 
too much time having late-night 
life conversations with friends.

I was preparing to travel out 

of the country over the summer 
when I finally admitted to my 
mom that I was having trouble 
eating. Anything I ate or drank 
caused me physical pain. I had 
been ignoring it for some time 
for the sake of being 17 the way 
I wanted to. I wasn’t ready for 
life to get serious yet. Cancer 
was simply not part of the plan.

I spent a few weeks abiding 

by a strict doctor-ordered diet, 
and after seeing no changes, 
I had the MRI that showed 
the first tumor. It was hard to 
admit I was sick after having 
spent months forcing myself to 
embrace the invincibility of 17. 
It’s the perfect balance between 
youth and adulthood: At 17, you 
are free to make mistakes with-
out large repercussions. You 
can afford to be careless and 

impulsive because you have the 
redeeming qualities of youth 
on your side. At the same time, 
it’s when you first have the 
chance to take control of your 
life. Though most major deci-
sions can be delayed until 18, 
you start to weigh them at 17. 
What colleges sound exciting? 
What new place would you 
like to explore? How will you 
decorate your new space? To a 
certain extent, these questions 
are largely in your hands. So I 
didn’t want to be sick. I didn’t 
want to miss out on this part of 
being 17 — on the making mis-
takes, on the manifesting of my 
future path. 

Cancer magnified this para-

dox. I spent the rest of my 
summer in Ann Arbor, moving 
constantly in between the Rogel 
Cancer Center and the C.S. 
Mott Children’s and Von Voigt-
lander Women’s Hospital. For 
my specific type of cancer, usu-
ally seen in patients 60 years or 
older, the more qualified doc-
tors resided at Rogel and the 
main University Hospital. But, 
since I was only 17, I had all of 
my MRI, CAT and PET scans 
at the Children’s Hospital. At 
17, I was handed a pink Dora 
pillow as they prepared me for 
my scans. I took a picture with 
a Big Bird statue and started to 

collect hospital stickers. The 
enormity of the world I origi-
nally feared became painfully 
small. 

It was difficult to figure out 

how to feel about it all — not 
just the diagnosis, but being rel-
atively young for the diagnosis 
and all the while being on the 
brink of adulthood. At Rogel, I 
was constantly placed next to 
white-haired, wrinkly patients 
in the lobbies, and every time I 
met a new doctor or nurse, they 
would greet me with “I’ve never 
had such a young patient here 
before.” Meanwhile, I stuck out 
like a sore thumb at the Chil-
dren’s Hospital, standing next 
to toddlers as we rode the eleva-
tor up to pediatric radiology. 

The original beauty of the 

paradox of 17 quickly turned 
ugly. I was treated neither like 
an adult nor like a child. I had 
to be accompanied by an adult 
to all of my appointments and 
scans, but I was the one fill-
ing out the paperwork. I was 
old enough to articulate my 
pain and understand my diag-
nosis, but I needed my parent’s 
consent to receive any medical 
treatment. I was contemplating 
my odds of living before I could 
even buy a lottery ticket.

It all started as an innocent way of 

sending funny pictures of yourself to 
your friends on Snapchat and “harm-
lessly” touching up small blemishes 
on our faces to appear more flatter-
ing in our selfies. Now, social media 
has transformed into an inescapable 
reality where significantly altering 
your appearance to seem more “pol-
ished” and “socially acceptable” is 
the norm. The existence of Snapchat 
and Instagram filters, Photoshop 
and Facetune has become normal-
ized, drastically changing the natu-
ral state of our bodies in order to be 
perceived as desirable. 

I’ve been using social media since 

I was 12 years old. I’ve witnessed the 
change from casual Snapchat con-
versations and unedited Instagram 
pictures to Photoshopped faces and 
unrealistic edits. Facetune, Pho-
toshop and Snapchat filters have 
absolutely demolished society’s per-
ception of normality to the point 
where there is a stark difference 
between our natural appearance and 
the body that is posted on our feeds. 
Filters and apps smooth out every 

single possible blemish on one’s face, 
dramatically enlarge lips, change 
eye colors and more — all in order 
to make people appear perfect. They 
put us into a body completely differ-
ent from the one we really live in. 
What used to be a fun way of sharing 
life with friends has now turned into 
a modality centered on overanalyz-
ing every miniscule part of a picture 
to make sure our posts portray us as 
the best and most perfect versions of 
ourselves. 

It’s extremely difficult for me to 

get into the mindset of accepting my 
face and body as beautiful the way 
they are when I’m constantly sur-
rounded by other people who appear 
to be perfect. It is so tempting to fix 
my insecurities when one can easily 
tap a few buttons and become “per-
fect.” I desperately try not to use 
them because I have noticed how 
much they destroy my self-esteem, 
but because I am constantly sur-
rounded by “perfection” on my Ins-
tagram feed, it’s hard to beat the 
temptation of downloading Photo-
shop. If these apps can turn me into 
my idealized image of myself, why 
wouldn’t I want to use them? 

The widespread use of filters and 

Photoshop is largely attributed to 

the rise in the commodification of 
social media. As Social Media Influ-
encing has become a job, one’s per-
sonal brand is important to uphold. 
To make your life seem desirable and 
to keep the brand deals rolling, you 
have to look perfect and post aes-
thetic content. Simply put, the more 
people that are envious of your life-
style, the more brands will want to 
work with you and the more money 
you will make. I completely under-
stand that this is a way that many 
people make a living, but I honestly 
don’t know how much more of being 
“influenced” I can handle — espe-
cially if it means I am constantly 
surrounded by unrealistic expecta-
tions of what I should look like and 
how I should live. 

In addition to the alternate reali-

ties these filters create, they are 
also extremely problematic for non-
Eurocentric features and non-white 
skin tones. Filters are way too small 
for my Afrocentric lips. They place 
a white cast over my Black face, 
and turn my dark brown eyes light 
brown, blue or green. They even 
work to contour my nose to make it 
look visibly smaller. Filters create an 
unrealistic view of what our society 
looks like, not only by polishing peo-

ple’s faces to perceived perfection, 
but also by erasing non-white char-
acteristics in an attempt to create 
a “pretty” or “perfect” person. Fil-
ters continue to reinforce European 
standards of beauty and they don’t 
seem to be stopping anytime soon. 

I understand why people use fil-

ters and Photoshop. They’re great 
for hiding sleepy eyes, unexpected 
pimples and other unfavorable qual-
ities of our pictures. I also under-
stand how addicting editing your 
pictures can be. It is so easy to turn 
your body into your idealized self, 
and the praise you receive when 
you present yourself in this way is a 
serotonin booster. However, I miss 
the casual use of social media that 
we used to have. The constant state 
of perfection that society pressures 
us to adhere to is suffocating. It used 
to be so liberating to post whatever I 
wanted on social media; now I have 
to overanalyze every aspect of any 
photo I want to post.

This problem seems to grow even 

worse every day. Apps are becom-
ing so accurate in how they mold 
filters to our faces that it is getting 
harder and harder to tell if a filter 
or Photoshop is applied. People have 
expressed the desire for “Old Insta-

gram,” when it was a less judgement-
al and more casual space to share our 
lives with others. A recent attempt 
to restore the casual nature of Ins-
tagram has emerged through “photo 
dumps,” or the act of posting casual 
and unrelated pictures of one’s life, 
along with a few selfies in a single 
Instagram post. However, even these 
types of posts are deliberately curat-
ed in a way that makes life seem per-
fectly imperfect. It is just another 
way to show your “real life,” but in 
a polished way. If we continue down 
this path of normalizing the altera-
tion of how we appear for the atten-
tion of Instagram, our perceptions of 
beauty will fall deeper into this false 
reality we have created and we will 
continue to lose our sense of self. 
The more we change what appears 
on our screens, the more we will 
hate what we see in the mirror. 

I’m terrified of what this is 

doing to society’s perception of life 
and beauty. We don’t see real life 
through a pretty filter. Our bodies 
are not meant to look perfect. If they 
are creating this false sense of life, 
are filters and Photoshop even ben-
eficial? Does editing ourselves really 
give us the satisfaction we want it 
to? 

A few weeks ago, I heard the FaceTime 

call notification buzzing from my phone. 
My eyes shifted and saw that it was Mom 
who was calling. Calls from Mom bright-
en my mood because on days that school 
takes up so much of my time, it’s nice see-
ing and hearing her face and voice from 
all the way back home. Mom called to 
ask about when my spring break for this 
school year was. After a quick Google 
search for the UMich academic calen-
dar, I told her the dates. The next thing I 
knew, she was talking about sending me 
to Mexico for spring break. 

I thought to myself, “Mexico? Mexico!” 

I’ve always wanted to go to Mexico, but 
I wasn’t expecting to go so soon. I had 
talked with my mom about wanting to 
go and we had decided to go together 
next year after I graduated. I thought to 
myself again, “Why am I going so soon? 
And without Mom?” I was excited, but I 
didn’t know the reason for the trip. This 
would be my first time stepping foot in 
Mexico and finally getting to meet my 
family. Up until this point, all I’ve had 
are laggy Whatsapp video calls. The plan 
had been to go to Mexico with Mom, but 
it was too urgent to wait.

Mom told me that I needed to go see 

Abuelita.

The reality is that Abuelita is getting 

older and her health is becoming a con-
cern. Our whole family knows this, and 
Mom wants me to see her and enjoy as 
much time with her as I can before things 
get worse. Abuelita has always been 
the one who visits us, but not this time 
around. Now I’m the one who’s visiting 
her. Over the years, it’s gotten harder for 
her to travel from Mexico to the U.S.; she 
has difficulty walking and doesn’t like to 
travel by air due to all the stress, com-
motion and long periods of waiting and 
sitting down. Abuelita’s health is get-
ting worse with every passing year and 
I needed to see her. I want to hug her, I 
want to hold her hand — for Mom, who 
hasn’t been to Mexico in over 30 years. 
But mostly, I want to create more memo-
ries with the person that I love so dearly.

Thankfully, my family has been lucky 

enough to have visited my grandma 
throughout the years but sadly not as 
much as we would have liked to. Geo-
graphic conditions make it difficult for 

me to connect with my family in Mexico, 
and I don’t get to see them as much as I 
would like. You see, these are the things 
you go through when you are part of an 
immigrant household. Our families liv-
ing in the U.S. and Mexico are miles 
apart, divided by a border that shows no 
remorse and imposes stringent immigra-
tion laws.

When my family lived in Los Angeles, 

Abuelita would visit us regularly, but I 
was too young to remember. At the time, 

she was 20 years younger and happy to 
see all her new grandchildren and be 
surrounded by my tíos, tías, primos and 
primas. A lot of our family migrated to 
Los Angeles, so it was like a second home 
away from everyone in Mexico. 

When I was five years old, we moved 

to Wyoming, Michigan. It took about 
five more years for Abuelita to visit us 
in the Midwest. I was 10 years old when 
Abuelita first visited. I still remember her 
adventurous spirit joining my siblings 
and me to explore the backyard, which 
is primarily forest; for many years there 
was a large, sand dune-like hill and vast 
empty lot being prepared for construc-
tion. Once you pass the woods and lot, 
you are within walking distance of a Dol-
lar Tree and liquor store.

As my siblings and I followed Abuelita 

through the bushes and trees, I stopped 

and froze when I saw the biggest spider 
I had ever seen. I had been comfortable 
exploring the backyard for some years, 
but my fear of spiders always stayed with 
me — I was terrified of spiders as a little 
kid. Everyone walked right past the spi-
der, but not me; I was stuck. Tears began 
to flow faster and faster down my cheeks. 
I knew that I had to pass the spider to 
be with my grandma and siblings, but I 
couldn’t pull myself together. The tears 
kept coming and everyone else became 

desperate. Abuelita got a little impatient 
but it’s not my fault; I wasn’t raised in 
the Mexican countryside like her where 
spiders and snakes were commonplace. 
Once Abuelita yelled, “Apúrate!” I knew 
that was my cue to get it moving. I was 
so little, but I knew that Abuelita wasn’t 
scared of anything and that she would 
push me to overcome the smallest of 
obstacles. I knew, even then, that her 
age and short stature never defined her 
because regardless of the adversity she 
faced in life, she never turned away. And 
I wanted to be like Abuelita. Fearless. As I 
got older, I began to understand what her 
history and upbringing were truly like. 
Abue’s mom lived through the Mexican 
Revolution in the early 1900s, where she 
had to hide from Mexican officials. 

There is a history of resilience in my 

family from the women who have shaped 

me into the person I am today. 

Some other memories I cherish with 

Abuelita when she visited were the times 
we went cherry picking, napped on the 
same bed, prayed alongside each other 
with a glow-in-the-dark rosary before 
going to bed and when I watched her 
take down shots of tequila like water. 
She didn’t visit often, but reflecting back 
on the times when she was here, I was 
always present with her. One of the most 
recent — and one of my favorite memories 
 

— is when we sat down and made brace-
lets together. 

The last time I saw her was when she 

most recently visited us in the summer 
of 2017. She spent the hot summer days 
inside the house nestled in our massage 
chair sewing or outside on a bench on the 
deck, knitting away. Abuelita loves to knit 
and quilt. It was something she enjoyed, 
but more importantly, it was also how she 
made money in Mexico. She was born in 
1933 and never got an education. Abuelita 
was born and raised en su rancho with 
no schooling, so she started working as a 
young girl. She doesn’t know how to read 
or write either, so selling the things she 
knitted and quilted was one of the best 
ways she could earn some income. She’s 
extremely talented, from making her 
own blankets and scarves to counter-
top mats and sweaters. She always adds 

a special touch to her pieces, knitting in 
floral designs to make it her own. I’ve 
always wanted to learn how she does it 
because I want to create some of my own 
clothes in the future.

During this particular summer, I 

would read books beside her in my own 
nook and occasionally glance over and 
watch as her tense hands worked their 
knitting magic. At some point, I put the 
book down and decided to sit next to her 
and just watch. She was knitting together 
a red hat. I wanted to join her but I knew 
that my skills were very limited. After 
telling her this, she taught me some of 
the knitting basics, but soon I lost track of 
the steps and gave up a little too quickly. 
When I put the yarn down on the floor, 
I saw her little box containing all of her 
supplies by her feet and I began to dig 
through it. There were so many different 
colors of yarn, so many different types of 
yarn. All different shapes and sizes. 

After failing the knitting experiment, 

I asked her if there was something easier 
we could try. This is when she brought up 
the idea of making bracelets. 

She told me to pick the color of yarn I 

wanted to use and I ended up picking the 
pink and yellow yarn. We sat by the win-
dow for the next 20 minutes working on 
the bracelet together, with the pink yarn 
in her hand and the yellow yarn in mine, 
creating this bracelet together as she was 
walking me through the process. 

“¡Así no mijo!”

 “¿Cómo?” 

“Mira, ¿ves? Fácil.” 

When completed, the bracelet was 

fresh bright pink and bright yellow. It was 
something that I created with Abuelita 
and it’s something that I’ve worn every 
day for the past four and a half years. 
It’s a reminder that Abuelita is with me 
wherever I go. Now my bracelets are a 
part of me; and when I don’t have them 
on, I don’t feel like myself. When I’m 
nervous, I fidget with the strings and 
I like to shake my bracelets out of habit 
to hear the beads beat against the yarn. 
Whenever I look at my bony left wrist, 
I’m reminded of that summer day spent 
by the window sill with Abuelita tying 
together this bracelet. 

1. Choose a topic. Pull up your notes app 

and reunite with the neglected thoughts 
in the dusty reaches of your brain. Cringe 
over an idea you jotted down before bed 
weeks ago. Don’t just scan your notes, 
squint hard so you don’t miss that phrase 
snuck between grapes ramen conditioner 
frosted flakes hand cream soy milk and 
fall 2020 Zoom links. Squint hard until 
your vision blurs. Until tears well up and 
the next thing you know it’s sophomore 
year you’re sobbing uncontrollably before 
your desk during the ending monologue 
in “Lady Bird.” Sometimes you think your 
life would be easier if you were a white 
girl from Sacramento. But instead of Sao-
rise Ronan, you would be the best friend 
who struggles with her body image and 
daddy issues.

2. Talk over your ideas. Attend a shift 

in the newsroom and meet with your 
friends, who are your editors. You com-
plain about how Chipotle didn’t put let-
tuce in your order, which you think is 

a hate crime against Canadians (Dis-
claimer: the author is Chinese Canadian). 
Observe the romance that brews in the 
newsroom. Watch people discover their 
newfound love for writing and editing. 
Watch columnists’ eyes turn into cres-
cent moons above their masks. Watch 
people approach another section’s table 
for candy and end up staying there for 
hours. Sometimes you are a part of the 
romance; sometimes you are merely a 
pedestrian that passes a late night diner, 
fascinated by the light and warmth inside 
which ultimately excludes you. That’s 
okay, you tell yourself, because you are 
just here to talk about ideas. Loneliness 
envelops you but it is only temporary, 
because an editor/friend finally finishes 
his homework and is traversing single-
digit temperatures to hear about your 
first column. You shit on the month of 
January together and joke about not hav-
ing a work life balance. Still, your idea 
weighs on your tongue like a Jolly Ranch-
er that’s too big to swallow. 

3. Scroll through Tinder, the app you 

told everyone that you downloaded for 
journalistic purposes, whatever that 

means. Close the Google Docs tab and 
take out your phone. Be sure to turn your 
brightness down to the lowest setting and 
tilt your screen away from the people sit-
ting near you in Trotter. You swipe left 
at the sight of men in her first photo or 
“Black Lives Matter” or “Feminism” in 
her list of “passions,” because you are 
tired of people who wear politics like 
an accessory. After almost developing 
thumb arthritis, you land on “Movies” 
“Coffee” “Cats” “Hiking.” You go through 
her selfies and judge her top Spotify art-
ists. A pop-up notification obscures her 
eyes, “How’s the piece going?” You do not 
respond.

4. Consume a lot of boba. According 

to your Snackpass Wrapped, you were 
embarrassingly among UniTea’s top 1% of 
customers in the past year. “I will be liv-
ing dangerously close to three boba plac-
es next year,” you joked when your mom 
picked you up from the airport for win-
ter break. “Bubble tea is disgusting,” you 
recall her responding. You think about 
the internalized racism and self-hatred 
she has imparted, and the years it took 
to unlearn it all. How in every story you 

write, there is a mother, even though you 
can barely recall the last time you shared 
a casual conversation. You think about 
how writing, especially for Michigan in 
Color, is an act of resistance, to her and 
to the beliefs she stands for. You wonder 
if there will come a day when she reads 
your articles. If she will read through 
each line with a Chinese dictionary open 
on her phone. If she will finally under-
stand your sadness, and then you will 
regain your mother. 

5. Next, pan-fry kimchi pancakes after 

midnight. Because kimchi pancakes are 
fucking delicious.

6. Now, it’s time to ask your editor for 

an extension. Wait till the last minute to 
text her because, just hours before the 
deadline, you believed you could finish. 
You were wrong. She graciously grants 
you some extra time, but now you are 
more than terrified. Capitalism has made 
you internalize that time is linear, thus 
more time must equal a better product. 
So exit the window and tell yourself that 
inspiration will come in a few days; it 
won’t.

7. Type. Take up the blank space with 

your words. Let your joy and grief spill 
like a broken faucet. Recall the reason 
why you started writing in the first place, 
when your story was read aloud before 
the class in 3rd grade. Or when you per-
formed self-directed skits for your fam-
ily during kindergarten. Because what is 
writing if not thinking and scraping and 
thinking and scraping and rehearsing in 
your mind 1000 times before even typ-
ing out the first letter? Remember the 
people you are writing for. Write for your 
friends who call you during breakdowns 
in between classes. Write for your friends 
who can recite the entirety of Lisa’s rap 
in “Ice Cream.” Write for your friends 
who took a shot to every homoerotic 
moment in Red Velvet’s “Bad Boy.” Write 
for your friends’ smeared mascara write 
for your friends’ couple rings write for 
your friends’ avocado salad recipe write 
for your friends’ Snackpass gifts write 
for your friends’ curated Spotify playlist 
write for the people who stay with you 
and cheer and clap until your editor hits 
“Publish.”

8. Go back to your friends. For they are 

the reason why you write at all.

8 — Wednesday, February 9, 2022 

On Sunday Jan. 26, student 

organizers from the Indian Amer-
ican Student Association and the 
United Asian American Orga-
nizations came together to host 
an intimate dialogue about the 
re-examination of South Asian 
Queerness — a much-needed first 
of its kind. Before the event was 
underway, I sensed something 
irresolute in the air of the dimly 
lit Hussey Room at the Michi-
gan League. Though, more likely 
than not, it was just me and my 
unfamiliarity with safe Queer 
spaces that also reflected my eth-
nic identity. To ease my nerves, 
I channeled my inner reporter 
and quickly introduced myself to 
IASA Social Awareness Co-Chairs 
Meghana Kandiraju and Sahana 
Prabhu and IASA Co-President 
Shaunak Puri, who welcomed me 
and shared their enthusiasm in 
hosting this unique event.

As folks settled down, Kan-

diraju and Prabhu encouraged 
attendees to speak to one another 
about their experiences with the 
LGBTQ+ community — as an ally 
or as a member — in the realms 
of 
mainstream 
media, 
fam-

ily dynamics and cultural values. 
Though the prompt was unmis-
takably catered to a predominant-
ly cishet audience, individuals 
shared their support, their qualms 
and their collective desire, among 
other things, to slowly integrate 
what little media representation 
does exist for Queer South Asian 
people into the purview of their 
most immediate families. Within 
the South Asian culture, especial-
ly within family dynamics, exists 
deeply rooted gender norms and 
general nonacceptance of Queer 
identities. This discourages many 
Queer South Asians from coming 
out, and for the lot that do, there 
often remains the underlying 
familial expectation of eventual 
cisheteronormative 
marriage. 

One individual went on to express 
how she felt it her duty as a cis-
gender, straight woman to talk to 
her family about Queerness under 
her relative privilege of social 
and cultural security. As she and 

other cishet people indulged in 
their well-intentioned sentiments, 
when it came around to the Queer 
attendees, there was a notable 
stoicism among their responses. 
For my half of the table, learning 
about Queerness was a matter of 
personal experience.

The Co-Chairs then delved into 

the forgotten sexual diversity of 
South Asian culture dating back 
to the Kama Sutra and early Tamil 
Sangam literature. The Kama 
Sutra is an ancient Indian Sanskrit 
text full of prose and poetry on 
sexuality, eroticism and emotion-
al fulfillment in life. As Kandi-
raju and Prabhu noted, both these 
precolonial texts had segments 
dedicated to the homosexual rela-
tions of their time, but were often 
overlooked by the enactment of 
restrictions and fines that grew 
more punitive well into the Medi-
eval empire, the Mogul empire 
and the British empire. 

They went on to explain the 

effects of British colonial rule on 
Queer rights, which started with 
the Offenses Against the Per-
son Act in 1861. This act codified 
consensual and nonviolent sod-
omy under physical and sexual 
acts of violence, resulting in a life 
sentence. Further, it begot Sec-
tion 377 of the Indian Penal Code 
which directly criminalized any 
intercourse “against the order 
of nature,” including consensual 
homosexual activity. The law was 
only recently ruled unconstitu-
tional in 2018.

In response to this historical 

context, many attendees started 
to realize much of the current 
anti-Queer sentiment within the 
diaspora stems directly from its 
legal implementation due to Brit-
ish colonialism.

Next, 
Puri 
introduced 
the 

Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 which 
specifically targeted “eunuchs,” 
a stigmatizing colonial term that 
refers to individuals who do not 
conform to British ideas of mascu-
linity and gender. This inherently 
ostracized the Hijra community 
as well, a once venerated, diverse 
community of intersex people, 
asexual people, non-binary peo-
ple and transgender people that 
held important religious and gov-
ernmental authority during the 

Mogul empire. In the late 20th 
century, people across the South 
Asian Diaspora advocated against 
this law and for the recognition 
of the Hijra community. Then, in 
2014, the Indian Supreme Court 
finally 
recognized 
Hijra 
and 

transgender people as a “third 
sex,” or “third gender” as indi-
cated by the language used by the 
court system. This legal recog-
nition served to safeguard their 
rights under the Constitution and 
laws made by Parliament and the 
State Legislature, and it marked 
a huge human rights victory sig-
nifying the expiration of another 
legal British influence. 

Still, conscious perpetuation of 

social harm against the Hijra com-
munity and South Asian Queer 
people continues today. Historical 
legal progress only goes so far to 
protect individuals from rampant 
hate crimes, damaging stigma and 
forced invisibility within and out-
side the diaspora.

There’s 
something 
really 

cathartic in learning about the 
gradual Queer liberation in South 
Asia through the renunciation of 
colonial legislation, and Kandi-
raju explained it perfectly when I 
came up to her later: 

“There is such a rich and deep 

history with regards to South 
Asians and Queerness. However, 
when these two identities are 
brought up, they are often seen 
as mutually exclusive — but this 
clearly isn’t the case,” Kandiraju 
said.

Clearly. And clearly, there’s a 

long way to go, but maybe Queer-
ness was never meant to feel so 
alienating within South Asian 
existence. Queerness is a multi-
tude of things that transcends any 
single identity or experience, just 
like the diaspora itself. The South 
Asian experience is inherently 
polylithic among its eight differ-
ent countries, but ethnic assimila-
tion to the model minority myth, 
a white supremacist ideology that 
upholds 
cisheteronormativity, 

diminishes this diversity. It leaves 
little to no room for intersectional 
identities, let alone Queerness. 
South Asian cishet individuals 
who implicitly subscribe to the 
model minority myth thus use 
this idea in order to perpetuate 

Queerphobia within the diaspora. 
Even so, recognizing the impor-
tant roots of Queerphobia within 
our culture does not absolve us of 
the responsibility to actively fight 
against it today.

For the second segment of the 

presentation, 
UAAO 
President 

Gina Liu delved into the redefi-
nition of Queerness and Queer 
activism within the diaspora. She 

started off by recognizing the his-
torically derogatory definition of 
the word Queer as well as its rec-
lamation in Queer liberation. She 
then explained how non-western 
countries are othered for their 
lack of conformity to western ide-
als, and in turn, homosexuality 
has now been duped into white 
progressiveness and ulterior pink-
washing under what is refered to 
as “homonationalism.” 

Through 
homonationalism, 

nationalist regimes operate under 
the guise of progressiveness by 
associating homosexuality with 
their ideals. In their ostentatious 
performance of Queer liberation, 
they distract attention from their 
more oppressive policies. Israel’s 
campaign as the “gay mecca” of 
the Middle East is an extreme 
example of how pinkwashing is 
used to violently advance Zion-
ist, anti-Muslim rhetoric. This 

ongoing campaign is a direct PR 
attempt to overshadow violence 
against Palestinians as a whole 
while aggrandizing Israel’s Queer 
rights agenda as the ultimate lib-
erator of Palestinian and Arab 
Queer people.

Similar strategies are utilized 

by the radical right in the United 
States to push across conserva-
tive agendas while remaining 
palatable to woke America. Queer 

liberation in America is thus pos-
ited as the savior of young Queer 
immigrants, and being Queer as a 
member of a non-white diaspora 
is erroneously propogated as a 
privilege of white progressiveness 
unattainable in the homeland.

This 
perception 
of 
mutual 

exclusivity between being a Queer 
person and South Asian, to many 
families, means that the adoption 
of such “western ideals” takes 
away from traditional culture. 
When South Asian immigrant 
parents say, “We’re not American 
in that way,” they are telling us 
that Queerness is contradictory to 
our heritage — yet precolonial his-
tory teaches us that we are inher-
ently South Asian in that way. 

After introducing the facade 

of western Queer politics, Liu 
importantly made note of the oft-
invisible histories of South Asian 
Queer people and Queer activism 

in the United States. She indicated 
the presence of same-sex relations 
as early as the first wave of Indian 
immigration in the 1880s particu-
larly among Punjabi men, while 
explaining how, as mentioned 
in Nayan Shah’s book “Stranger 
Intimacy: Contesting Race, Sexu-
ality and the Law in the North 
American West,” they were often 
accused of crossdressing by white 
men because they did not conform 

to expressions of European man-
hood. Additionally, she mentioned 
the role of publications such as 
Trikone Magazine and Anamika 
Magazine in celebrating Queer 
identities across the diasapora 
and aiding the decriminalization 
of sodomy in many countries. 

All this to say that seeing our-

selves in history is important, and 
in some ways, validating, but his-
tory itself is seldom exhaustive. 
Liu wrapped up by reminding 
audience members that there is 
inherent value in our own expe-
riences as we navigate very cis-
heteronormative and colonized 
spheres, saying, “Even if none of 
this existed, even if (this was) the 
first generation of Queer Asian 
people, that doesn’t make (your) 
experiences any less impactful or 
relevant.” 

It was 8 p.m. on the Saturday 

before Winter term began, and I 
was sitting on my bed at home in 
Chicago unraveling my box braids 
— the most recent hairstyle I had 
that soon grew outdated for me 
after a few weeks. I was planning 
on having a peaceful night filled 
with self-care practices and HBO 
movies, but as soon as I finished 
undoing my braids, I got a text 
from the hairstylist who was sup-
posed to do my hair: “Sorry, I have 
to cancel tomorrow, something 
came up.” While it may seem 
inconsequential for her to cancel 
on me, reading this text made my 
stomach drop. Usually, I prefer to 
wear protective hairstyles when-
ever I can because they require 
less maintenance, which is per-
fect considering how busy my 
day-to-day schedule is. I wanted 
to do this before coming back to 
campus because I knew I would 
quickly become busy as soon as I 
got to Ann Arbor. But having my 

stylist cancel on me completely 
threw a wrench in my plan. 

Before panicking, I immediate-

ly texted my usual go-to stylist, 
and she regrettably informed me 
that she was on vacation. Next, I 
called a friend, asking if she could 
do my hair, and she apologetically 

told me that she wouldn’t have the 
time to do so before classes start-
ed. Lastly, I even tried booking a 
hairstylist that I’d found on Insta-
gram, with whom I immediately 
made an appointment when I saw 
an opening … just for her to can-
cel on me within the hour. I soon 

became fed up with trying to find 
a new stylist to do my hair — I was 
leaving at 6 a.m. the next morn-
ing for Ann Arbor, and my options 
were slim. I was left with only one 
choice: I had to get it done myself. 

I immediately went to my bath-

room and started brainstorming 

what to do with my hair. I knew 
I couldn’t attempt a style that 
was too complex considering the 
limited time that I had. Every 
time the frustration with my hair 
reaches a new peak, I always grab 
my scissors, only half-jokingly 
thinking about shaving my head 

entirely. It would surely be a lot 
less work to deal with. I’ve expe-
rienced this moment too many 
times before — getting frustrated 
with my hair to the point where I 
just don’t want to deal with it any-
more. 

During my sophomore year of 

high school, I was invited to an 
extravagant 16th birthday party 
at a bowling alley for one of my 
friends. On the morning of the 
party, I woke up and instantly 
knew I was going to have a bad 
hair day. With every style I tried, 
I grew increasingly annoyed with 
my hair, and finally, I texted my 
friend that I woke up with a sore 
throat and that I wouldn’t be able 
to make it to the party. In hind-
sight, my hair didn’t look that bad, 
but I was so bogged down by the 
idea that I had “difficult” hair 
that I had just given up complete-
ly for the day.

When I was a junior, I did in 

fact take a pair of scissors to my 
hair, cutting nearly all of it off and 
forcibly beginning my natural 
hair journey. At the time, I got so 
fed up I felt it would be simpler to 

start all over from scratch. This 
moment served as a catalyst for 
a transformational hair journey 
in which I had to learn how to do 
my own hair, rather than relying 
on my mom to take care of it for 
me. Since then, I’ve slowly been 
on the path to becoming better 
at styling my hair by myself. For 
the first year, doing my own hair 
felt incredibly tedious. I endured 
many long nights and sore arms 
from just washing, conditioning 
and trying to style my hair into 
two-strand twists. Now, I can tell 
when it’s time to give my hair a 
detox, I always know when I’m in 
need of a trim and I have my wash 
day routine down to an exact sci-
ence. 

However, I’m still a novice at 

braiding my own hair, so when 
all of my stylists canceled on me, 
I was forced to enlist some help. 
I came knocking at the doors of 
my two older sisters’ bedrooms 
and to my relief, they came to the 
rescue. Around 9 p.m., my sisters 
began to help me part my hair 
and braid it down. For over six 
hours, we watched movies, lis-

tened to music and had amusing, 
yet heartfelt, conversations about 
relationships and our love lives. 
We got the chance to spend qual-
ity time together, which doesn’t 
happen as often now that we’re 
all so busy with our academic and 
professional lives. I’m not sure if 
I had ever been more grateful to 
have two older sisters. By 3 a.m., 
we were exhausted, and our fin-
gers were beginning to cramp, but 
finally, my hair was done. Even 
though I knew I’d be running on 
three hours of sleep, I was filled 
with the immense relief of not 
having to worry about my hair for 
the next few weeks. At the end of 
it all, my eldest sister turned to me 
and said, “This was cute and all, 
but don’t ever let it happen again,” 
and we laughed. While she didn’t 
show it on her face, I knew she 
was glad that she got to spend the 
time with us as well. A situation 
that started off as stressful and 
anxiety-inducing ended in a tir-
ing, yet heartwarming, moment 
between my sisters and me. 

Trigger warning: this article 

contains descriptions of murder 
and gun violence, mentions of 
gender-based harassment, race-
based harassment and sexual 
harassment.

The Asian woman-white man 

coupling has been a long-run-
ning joke and stereotype that 
is still cycling through the col-
lective consciousness of Ameri-
can popular culture and online 
platforms. As much as I hate 
to admit, there is some truth 
to the stereotype. Indeed, an 
Asian woman-white man cou-
ple can be spotted frequently on 
city streets and university cam-
puses as well as in other left-
leaning spaces in recent years. 
However, I was not aware of the 
terrifying existence of a violent 
incel community online com-

posed of East Asian men until 
fairly recently. This community 
assembled in response to Asian 
women dating out of their race 
at a higher rate than any other 
gendered racial groups, and 
perhaps to a lesser extent, their 

emasculation at the hands of 
popular culture.

Incel is short for “invol-

untarily celibate,” a term co-
opted by straight, cisgendered 
right-leaning young men who, 
due to one reason or another, 
find themselves deprived of 
sex 
and 
relationships 
with 

women. 
Upon 
first 
glance, 

their strange philosophy and 
vendetta against women may 
appear pathetic, but the extent 
to which they have taken their 

misogyny is beyond extreme. 
In several subreddits which 
are now banned, these men 
discussed violent revenge plots 
and fantasies they would insti-
gate against “Chads” and “Sta-
cies,” which are incel slang 
for attractive young men and 
women. “Chads” and “Stacies” 
are almost certainly racialized, 
as they are common names for 
young, white people, and with 
that whiteness comes implied 
attractiveness as well as tra-
ditional masculinity and femi-
ninity, accordingly. Aside from 
the fact that incels in general 
are 
overwhelmingly 
white, 

East Asian incels are in a league 
of their own, as they focus 
more on their own racial iden-
tity. They also especially focus 
on their female counterparts, 
blaming their interracial mar-
riages as the source of the East 
Asian incel’s personal misery.

One of the most infamous 

incels was the lone gunman of 
the heinous 2014 San Diego Isla 
Vista killing who was of mixed 
white and East Asian descent. 
He had released a 140-page 
manifesto detailing his life 
and citing his hatred toward 
his circumstances, such as his 
mixed heritage and parents’ 
divorce, as contributors toward 
his perceived social rejection 
and misogyny. He then went on 
to murder his housemates and 
seven sorority girls at the Uni-
versity of California, Santa Bar-
bara, whom he considered to 
be the physical manifestation 
of “Stacies” and the embodi-
ment of the women who reject-
ed him. He then went on to 
murder 2 of his housemates, 1 
other man, and 3 sorority girls, 
before committing suicide. The 
gunman perceived his Chinese 
heritage as a deciding factor in 
his attractiveness, and conse-
quently, as the reason for his 

failure with women. 

The manifesto was fueled by 

self-hatred 
and 
internalized 

white supremacy. The gunman 
attributed his “dorkiness” to his 
Chinese identity and cited his 
jealousy towards another fully 
Asian man receiving attention 
from a white woman, who was 
the only type of woman he was 
attracted to. Him being only 
attracted to white women, of 
course, echoed his own inter-
nalized racism, as further evi-
denced by his resentment for 
his Chinese mother for her 
interracial 
marriage 
to 
his 

father. His self-hatred, mixed 
with an inferiority complex 
over full-blooded Asian people, 
had perhaps manifested in his 
brutal murder of his house-
mates, who too were young 
East Asian men, as well as the 
sorority girls.

O

n Aug. 19, 2021, Only-
Fans announced that 
the 
platform 
would 

ban sexually explicit content. This 
came as a shock to many, espe-
cially sex workers who depend 
on posting their content on the 
site for income. OnlyFans’ pub-
licity has skyrocketed because 
of its explicit content, and it is 
supported immensely by explicit 
content creators. Banks and pay-
ment companies were the main 
reason behind OnlyFans’ deci-
sion. Many banks do not process 
payments connected to the adult 
industry, citing the risks of asso-
ciating with adult content. A simi-
lar business move was seen when 
PornHub removed all unverified 
partner content in response to 
Mastercard and Visa prohibiting 
the use of their payment method 
on the site after images of rape and 
abuse were discovered. Despite 

OnlyFans’ seemingly set-in-stone 
intention to ban explicit con-
tent, the company suspended it 
only six days later, claiming that 
they received assurance that they 
would be able to support their 
entire creator community. This 
action from OnlyFans was a major 
discredit to sex workers’ labor. Sex 
work is and should be seen as labor 
that is valued. Further, sex work 
should be legalized or at least 
decriminalized because the bene-
fits of legalized sex work outweigh 
the moral aversions those against 
sex workers hold.

OnlyFans’ demeanor toward the 

sex workers on its platform is indica-
tive of the wider negative stigma 
attached to sex work. Several argu-
ments are common, often made to 
discredit and immoralize sex work, 
but most of them neglect the com-
plexity of the issues they discuss. A 
common argument is that sex work 
isn’t “real” work. This takes a narrow 
view at what the concept of work can 
entail. Work is not just a process by 
which a laborer produces an object or 

traditional, physical labor. Sex work is 
actually closely related to the work of 
a masseuse, therapist, actor, and so on. 
This type of work produces emotional 
labor that consumers gain a benefit 
from. While sex work may not be be 
providing a “traditional” good or ser-
vice, the labor provided suffices the 
occupation as real work.

Another 
common 
argument 

against sex work is that female sex 
workers’ choice to become a sex work-
er harms other women and sends a 
bad message. For one, this argument 
neglects that people of all genders can 
be sex workers, but that’s besides the 
point. Some sex workers do say that 
in an ideal world sex work wouldn’t 
exist, but you have to play the hand 
you’re dealt in life. Sex work can often 
be easier to do than getting help from 
the state by hopping through tons of 
bureaucratic welfare hoops. 

But on the point that women par-

taking in sex work harm other women, 
it could be claimed that many occu-
pations women assume harm other 
women. Lawyers, police officers and 
other occupations can cause real harm 

to women at times. Sex workers are 
often targeted and harassed by police 
even more viscously than the clients 
they deal with. So, if those against sex 
work wish to claim that sex work is 
wrong because it harms women, they 
have to play the harm against women 
card consistently. 

The reality for sex workers at the 

moment is bleak, to say the least. 
Because much of sex work is criminal-
ized, sex workers are regularly appre-
hended and arrested. Police brutality 
against sex workers is also not uncom-
mon. Lack of legalization or decrimi-
nalization means that the industry is 
mostly unregulated and leaves sex 
workers unprotected. Sex workers 
are threatened by clients, others in the 
industry and the law. If a sex worker 
is on the receiving end of abuse from 
a client, they are unable to go to law 
enforcement for help because they will 
most likely be detained for participating 
in sex work or prostitution. Contacting 
clients through the internet can be safer 
for sex workers as they can screen cli-
ents before meeting in person. But laws 
like SESTA and FOSTA have made 

doing that quite difficult, influencing 
platforms like Tumblr, Craigslist and 
most recently OnlyFans to curtail or 
ban not safe for work (NSFW) content 
from their platforms. Criminalizing sex 
work makes the occupation a form of 
black market labor that ends up being 
unsafe for the sex workers themselves. 
A lot of these issues could be helped 
through legalization or decriminaliza-
tion.

Legalizing, or at the very least decrimi-

nalizing, sex work would bring about 
many benefits for the lives of sex work-
ers and the sex work industry. For one, it 
would keep sex workers safer. Having sex 
work decriminalized would likely abate 
some of the police brutality afflicting sex 
workers, since officers would not be able 
to charge them on account of their occu-
pation. It also would allow sex workers to 
be able to reach out to law enforcement 
when needed if they experience danger 
in their work. Another benefit would be 
that sex work would become taxable and 
would be able to generate more income 
for governments if it were not criminal-
ized. 

In terms of whether sex work 

should be decriminalized or legal-
ized, many sex workers advocate for 
decriminalization over legalization. 
Legalization has the potential to create 
a sort of brothel system that may not 
allot much agency to sex workers and 
to create a two-tiered system where 
only some sex workers are able to 
front the fees to pay for proper licens-
ing. Decriminalization, on the other 
hand, would put power directly into 
the hands of sex workers and would 
not create legal barriers that only some 
have the means to bypass.

Sex work should be legalized, or 

at least decriminalized. As the Only-
Fans’ NSFW content ban shows, stig-
ma around sex work is still rampant. 
When looking at all of the arguments 
leveled against sex work, only per-
sonal moral imperatives remain. One 
should not be able to dictate the pro-
fession of another based on their per-
sonal beliefs. Sex work is valid labor, it 
should be viewed as such. The Only-
Fans ban is a litmus test that indicates 
the devaluation of sex workers. It’s 
time for this to change for the benefit 
of sex workers everywhere.

W

inters 
in 
Michigan 

are not for the faint 
of heart. As students 

here at the University of Michigan, 
we have all experienced the wind 
biting at our faces as we trek from 
class to class in the blustering winter 
weather. The cold, however, is only 
half the battle. Along these walks, 
patches of ice, piles of snow and 
areas of sludge serve as obstacles to 
our destinations. With a two-day 
snowstorm striking Ann Arbor just 
this past week, we understand these 
phenomena all too well. 

The winter obstacles we face 

are not only an inconvenience 
for students, but a danger to the 
community as a whole. There are 
serious 
consequences 
for 
Ann 

Arbor citizens, especially for the 
elderly and the disabled. Last year, 
an 88-year-old man named Richard 
Derick was walking his dog in 
Kerrytown when he slipped and 
fell after stepping over a snowbank 
left by a plow truck. A couple hours 
later, he tragically passed away from 
a brain bleed.

Incidents such as Derick’s are 

preventable, but only with adequate 
maintenance 
of 
our 
sidewalks 

and roads during the winter. 
Unfortunately, Ann Arbor currently 
lacks effective maintenance in this 
area. In light of this, it is necessary 
to consider potential solutions to the 
dangers of poor snow removals in 
Ann Arbor. 

In Holland, Mich., there is 

an intricate system of hot water 
that runs beneath the sidewalks 
in order to melt snow and ice as 
soon as it begins to accumulate. 
Ann Arbor could certainly follow 
suit; however, council members 
expressed 
concern 
about 
this 

strategy, as this would be out of the 
question in terms of budget and 
logistics. While the eventual result 
of more effective snow removal 
is worthwhile, it is unlikely that 
Ann Arbor residents would be 
happy with years of disruptive 
construction across the city.

Alternatively, Ann Arbor could 

ramp up the number of employees 
who work to clear the roads and 
sidewalks. The worker shortages 
plaguing not only Ann Arbor, 
but the entire country, make this 
easier said than done. Some council 
members have also noted that fiscal 
considerations need to be made, 
arguing that the costs of this solution 
would again be too high. Depending 

on the extent of the staffing ramp 
up, the cost could reach into the 
millions.

This all seems pretty dismal, with 

solution after solution being shot 
down. However, there are actions 
we can take as a university to help 
the greater Ann Arbor community.

To understand our role in 

snow removal, we must first 
acknowledge that the vast majority 
of the student population is young 
and able-bodied. Because of this, 
we are sometimes oblivious to the 
risks that icy sidewalks and piled 
up snow pose. Yet, as members of 
the larger community, there is a 
level of responsibility students need 
to take on in order to ensure they 
are playing their role in protecting 
others. We must understand that 
not all members of the campus 
community, nor Ann Arbor as a 
whole, have the capacity to jump 
around or over snow and ice. For 
many, effective snow removal is 
not about convenience, it is about 
safety. 

We must also remind ourselves 

that snow removal is not only a 
responsibility, but a law we must 
follow. The city of Ann Arbor has 
clear requirements for residents 
and property owners, including 
the need to clear snow and ice on 
adjacent sidewalks and crosswalk 
ramps, as well as near bus stops and 
mailboxes. Individuals who fail to 
follow the city ordinance can be 
subject to the costs it takes for the 
city to clear the areas the resident 
failed to clear. Residents also have 
the ability to report those who are 
not following the ordinance. 

Those who live off campus 

are 
sometimes 
responsible 
for 

snow removal on their property, 
depending on the caveats in their 
lease. Students should check their 
lease to see what their landlord’s 
policy is. Those who are proactive 
about knowing the relevant terms 
of their lease can avoid potential 
fines if it is indeed the landlord’s 
responsibility to remove snow and 
ice on that property. They can hold 
their landlords accountable if and 
when they fail to properly maintain 
the surrounding sidewalks and 
streets. 

For those who are required to 

remove snow under their lease, 
many properties do not offer salt 
treatment to residents, as this is not 
standard. To remedy this, the city 
offers free salt and sand solution 
that residents can use to prevent 
ice accumulation at seven locations 
throughout the city. 

Unfortunately, none of those 

locations are particularly close to 
the U-M campus or the off-campus 
areas where students tend to live, 
making it even more difficult 
for students living off campus to 
effectively treat their sidewalks. 
We recommend that, in order to 
help students play their role in 
snow removal, the University or 
the city could offer salt to students 
in a location they frequent daily. 
This could be at a location such 
as The Union on Central Campus 
or Pierpont Commons on North 
Campus. 

Though the Editorial Board 

recognizes that the University is 
generally effective in keeping the 
campus cleared and safe of snow 
and ice, there is certainly room 
for improvement. In the past, the 
University has done a comparatively 
better job of removing snow and 
ice on Central Campus than in 
off-campus areas, even though 
many students live in those areas. 
It seems that there is an invisible 
boundary where the level of care 
that the University provides to its 
campus fades away. The University 
should extend their boundaries 
of snow removal in order to play 
a role in helping off-campus sites. 
Using University resources to help 
remove snow in nearby off campus 
sidewalks would help alleviate the 
burden felt by both residents and the 
city. 

When shoveling snow or salting 

driveways and sidewalks, it is 
important that students wear the 
proper winter gear. Unfortunately, 
some are unable to afford a pair of 
winter boots and a heavy winter 
coat. There are no immediate 
locations on or around campus 
where students can go for cheap 
winter gear. Bivouac, on State 
Street, is one of the few stores that 
sells winter gear on campus, but 
the brands they sell are relatively 
expensive, and this may be out of 
reach for some students. As such, 
the University should also consider 
adding a winter clothing and gear 
bank, similar to the successful food 
bank program they run, where 
students in need can go for cheap or 
free winter attire. 

While snow removal can seem 

a trivial issue on the surface, 
considering the risks that can come 
with improper or inadequate snow 
removal show how important it 
is. Especially to a populace that 
traverses to and from campus on 
foot daily, it is crucial that a proper 
system is in place and that all players 
do their part to ensure the safety of 
Ann Arbor residents.

From The Daily: Snow removal 

policies in Ann Arbor need to change

BENJAMIN DAVIS

Opinion Columnist

Sex work stigma is alive and well on OnlyFans 

T

he University announced 
on Jan. 15 that President 
Mark Schlissel had been 

fired, effective immediately, for an 
“inappropriate relationship” with 
a subordinate employee. It should 
be noted, given the present social 
climate around issues of sexual 
and workplace misconduct, that 
there is no evidence that Schlissel 
engaged in any form of predation 
or coercion; he was removed solely 
for the inappropriate relationship 
he maintained with a subordinate. 
While many in the University 
community 
were 
blindsided 

by the news, either because of 
the timing or the nature of the 
allegations which finally did him 
in, a outpouring of student support 
for Schlissel’s removal took shape 
as the news broke. Schlissel had 
long been a divisive figure in Ann 
Arbor — his alleged affair was only 
his latest in a long line of blunders 
and humiliations throughout his 
otherwise-forgettable 
term 
as 

president.

Whether Schlissel should have 

been fired isn’t really the issue 
here — he violated the University’s 
supervisor 
relationship 
policy. 

The bigger problem at hand is 
how he could possibly have been 
allowed to continue in his position 
up to this point, sex scandals 
notwithstanding. 
Schlissel 
has 

consistently been under fire for 
his handling of a variety of issues 
throughout his seven-plus years 
leading the University, but his 
most notable failure came with 
his handling of the COVID-19 
pandemic. It’s a common sentiment 
around campus that Schlissel has 

brazenly placed the University’s 
economic 
interests 
ahead 
of 

the safety and security of U-M 
students.

While in retrospect it’s obvious 

that 
every 
university 
would 

face significant challenges in 
mitigating the impact of COVID-
19 on campus, Schlissel’s failures 
were glaring. It wasn’t enough 
for him to bring nearly 30,000 
students back to campus for 
the fall 2020 semester, despite 
keeping all instruction online. It 
also was not enough to eschew 
routine mandatory testing for all 
students — clearly in the interest 
of limiting documented cases and 
keeping students on campus. It 
wasn’t enough to brazenly ignore 
a vote of no-confidence by the 
Faculty Senate in response to his 
COVID-19 protocols. It was raising 
student tuition — with approval 
from the Board of Regents — 
amid a crippling economic crisis 
and public health emergency 
that made it abundantly clear 
Schlissel had one singular motive 
for his administrative policies: 
the University’s bottom line. It 
was not student safety, nor was 
it providing the most fruitful 
academic experience in spite of the 
circumstances. It was money.

It should outrage the U-M 

community that this man has 
retained his employment by the 
school in a more limited capacity: as 
a tenured professor. At a time when 
University accountability is at the 
forefront, Schlissel is going to keep 
a cushy title and an on-campus 
office? The University is sending 
this man into the classroom as a 
role model to the next generation 
of doctors and educators? It’s 
offensive. It’s a slap in the face 
to a community that was clearly 

happy to have seen the last of Mark 
Schlissel.

This is someone with plenty to 

be ashamed of, but what should 
embarrass him most is his betrayal 
of his obligations as a trained 
medical 
professional; 
Schlissel 

is both a medical doctor and a 
professor of immunology and 
molecular biology. He spent years 
of his life studying the human 
immune system, but was willfully 
negligent as a highly infectious 
disease ran rampant through an 
institution he claimed to oversee. 
He knew opening the dorms at 
full capacity would render the 
University 
an 
industrial-sized 

petri dish. He also knew one of his 
bosses, the widely-loathed U-M 
Regent Ron Weiser (R), stood to 
benefit economically from the 
hastily-implemented 
return 
to 

campus. It doesn’t take an M.D. to 
come to those conclusions, only 
common sense and basic human 
decency. What is clear is that optics 
did not matter to Schlissel. In less 
than two years, that amounts to 
no less than five fireable offenses, 
but only when he became a social 
pariah was he removed. 

That’s what makes this so hard 

to understand. At one of the largest 
and most prestigious institutions 
of higher education in the country, 
the President placing students 
and the city at risk with his apathy 
was not cause for termination, 
but a relationship with a staffer 
was a bridge too far. The Board of 
Regents have a lot to answer for 
here, too. Schlissel was derelict in 
his duty to U-M students as a result 
of his actions, but the Board was 
derelict in its inaction. They are 
not blameless bystanders – they are 
constituent parties to a years-long, 
humiliating institutional scandal.

Schlissel’s firing is long overdue

T

his month in Virginia, 
my 
home 
state, 
Gov. 

Glenn Youngkin, R-Va., 

signed an executive order banning 
mask mandates in public schools 
— a move that produced mixed 
reactions from school districts 
across the state. Rural districts 
were quick to lift their mandates, 
while 
suburban 
districts 
in 

Northern Virginia and Richmond 
openly defied the governor. Seven 
districts went so far as to sue him for 
encroaching upon the authority of 
school districts to run themselves. 
Lt. Gov. Winsome Sears responded 
to the rebellious districts by stating 
the governor would withhold state 
funds from these districts to ensure 
compliance. 

Further complicating matters, 

a group of parents in Loudoun 
County (yes, that Loudoun County 
you might have heard of) stood 
outside a high school before 
classes to protest the school’s mask 
mandate. Thirty students, after 
refusing to wear a mask, were 
escorted to an auditorium and given 
the option to work asynchronously 
or go home. Similar treatment was 
given to a 10-year-old student at 
a neighboring elementary school. 
Broadly, however, there was little 
to no backlash against continued 
mask 
mandates 
in 
Northern 

Virginia.

Youngkin’s decision to ban these 

mandates, instead of leaving it up 
to local school districts, seems 
ill-advised. 
Rural 
communities 

might have been eager to lift their 
mandates, but, as evidenced by the 
response in Northern Virginia, the 
majority of families in suburban 
communities were still in favor 
of mask mandates. Youngkin is 
politically astute enough to have 
foreseen the widespread backlash. 
Wouldn’t devolving power back to 
individual districts increase local 
communities’ agency over their 
COVID-19 protocols and avoid 
unnecessary 
conflict? 
Perhaps, 

but Youngkin doesn’t need to 
make everyone happy — just the 
parents who voted him in. He ran 
a strong campaign that promised 
to give parents more control over 
education and is making good on 
that promise now.

While that may be all well 

and good for certain parents, 
Youngkin’s policy has already 
harmed some students, and it 
has the potential to wreak even 
more havoc. At least 31 students 
in Loudoun were humiliated as a 
consequence of Youngkin’s order. 
One could argue that the school 
administrators are to blame in this 
case, since they physically sent the 
kids into auditoriums, but they 
were acting according to public 
health guidelines and the interests 
of a majority of their respective 
school’s families. By signing the 
order, Youngkin gave his contingent 

of supporters in Northern Virginia 
false confidence that they could 
wave a piece of paper and get their 
way. Additionally, I find it difficult 
to believe that wearing a mask 
would have been worse for those 
students than being yanked into 
an auditorium. Sure, they may not 
have liked having to wear a mask all 
day, but it certainly wouldn’t have 
ostracized them from their peers 
to do so. 

I pray that case counts will be 

low in mask-optional schools. If 
Youngkin’s policy keeps people 
healthy, that would be great! But, 
if cases rise, then schools might 
encounter staffing issues that could 
precipitate temporary shifts back 
to remote learning, something 
districts around the country dealt 
with earlier this month. That 
would be unequivocally worse for 
students than a mask requirement 
due to the well documented mental 
health consequences of remote 
learning. 

Beyond the issue of masks, 

the crusade for “parents’ rights” 
raises bigger, long-term concerns 
for public education in Virginia. 
On the campaign trail, Youngkin 
released an ad featuring Laura 
Murphy, a Fairfax County parent 
who sought to ban Toni Morrison’s 
novel “Beloved” from the school’s 
curriculum because of the book’s 
explicit content. 

Gov. Youngkin’s push for “parents’ 

rights” opposes the interests of children

O

n Jan. 19, coming off a 
year of unprecedented 
attacks on the right 

to vote by Republican state 
legislatures 
throughout 

the 
country, 
congressional 

Democrats made their last-
chance 
gambit 
and 
finally 

had a vote on carving out an 
exception for the filibuster 
for voting rights and election 
reform 
legislation. 
As 
had 

been telegraphed for months, 
the move failed, coming up 
two votes short of the 50-vote 
threshold 
needed. 
All 
50 

Senate Republicans were in 
opposition, joined by centrist 
Democrats 
Joe 
Manchin, 

D-W.Va., and Kyrsten Sinema, 
D-Ariz. It was a deflating 
end to a long and seemingly 
hopeless effort, capped off 
with 
intraparty 
fighting 

and a prevailing pessimistic 
mentality. It also left a choice 
for congressional Democratic 
leaders: fold over and move on, 
or go back to the drawing board 
in hopes of getting at least 

something passed to protect 
an 
imperiled 
democracy. 

Thankfully, it appears some 
in Congress are beginning to 
choose the latter.

Seemingly 
just 
as 
the 

filibuster carveout vote failed, 
reports began to surface of an 
amplified bipartisan push to 
reform the Electoral Count Act, 
which lays out the procedure 
for counting Electoral College 
votes, along with the potential 
for 
increased 
funding 
for 

the facilitation of elections 
and measures to ensure the 
fair counting of votes. There 
has also been reporting that 
lawmakers are looking at ways 
to defend election workers, 
who had to endure an onslaught 
of 
dangerous 
rhetoric 
and 

physical threats of violence. 
The effort also seems to have 
real potential for success, with 
politicians on the ideological 
scale ranging from Sen. Chris 
Coons, D-Del. Chris Coons 
to 
House 
Minority 
Leader 
 

Kevin McCarthy R-Calif., who 
himself voted to overturn the 
election, expressing at least 
some sort of optimism and 
interest in a deal. 

These are all policies that 

would 
make 
an 
important 

difference, and would address 
some of the most important 
problems facing our elections. 
The potential to have wide-
ranging bipartisan support for 
such an issue that has sadly 
turned so contentious is a 
unique opportunity and one 
that should gladly be seized. 
Unfortunately, some Democrats 
don’t view it as such.

Some progressive Democrats 

have 
dismissed 
the 
effort, 

either as a distraction from the 
larger problem or insufficient 
to address the problems at 
hand. Sen. Raphael Warnock, 
D-Ga., when asked about the 
potential reform, stated, “They 
are not serious. And this is a 
diversion in order to prevent 
us from ensuring that every 
eligible 
American 
has 
the 

right to vote.” First, there does 
seem to be a serious effort at 
play, especially by senators 
like Susan Collins R-Maine, 
who 
has 
worked 
earnestly 

with Democrats in the past, 
on infrastructure for example. 
Second, if Democrats have an 
all-or-nothing attitude, in a 

50–50 Senate, they are going to 
struggle to get things done for 
the remainder of this session in 
Congress. When dealing with 
the realities of a 50–50 Senate, 
a bare House majority and a 
Democratic senator from a state 
that voted for Trump by more 
than 35 points, compromise is 
inevitable and necessary.

Additionally, 
Senate 

Majority 
Leader 
Chuck 

Schumer claimed the effort 
simply 
“says 
you 
can 
rig 

the 
elections 
anyway 
you 

want and then we’ll count it 
accurately.” This too, is the 
wrong approach. If all voter 
suppression, intimidation and 
barriers to the ballot suddenly 
evaporated, yet those counting 
and deeming the winner could 
simply throw out the results, 
turnout would be irrelevant. 

The reality is, though voter 

suppression and barriers to the 
ballot are real and dangerous, 
especially for minorities and 
the underserved, the larger 
threat to democracy is not 
actually solved by addressing 
voter 
suppression. 
For 

example, in the 2020 election, 
mail-in voting as a result of 

the pandemic made it easier 
than ever to vote. Turnout 
flourished, reaching numbers 
not seen since at least 1980. 

Yet, many would admit that 

the integrity of the election 
was under attack in ways not 
seen in the modern political 
era. 
State 
and 
local-level 

Republicans 
made 
attempts 

to send fraudulent “alternate” 
electors 
and 
prevent 
state 

election results from being 
certified, and 147 Republican 
members of Congress even 
voted to throw out the will of 
millions of voters in multiple 
states, even after the Jan. 
6 
insurrection 
had 
taken 

place. This is all on top of 
the sustained push by then-
President Trump and his allies 
to have then–Vice President 
Pence unilaterally reject slates 
of electors, a wildly anti-
democratic course of action 
that, thankfully, Pence did 
not pursue. If Pence had gone 
along with Trump, there is no 
clear telling what would have 
happened. As written, such a 
scenario is not explored within 
the Electoral Count Act, and 
it is worrisome to imagine 

how such an event would have 
unfolded.

These 
threats, 
among 

many others, illustrate the 
most dangerous threats to 
American democracy. Though 
discussions are preliminary, 
there is evidence to suggest 
that the new bipartisan push 
would help to greatly thwart 
these problems. If an avenue 
is there, as one appears to be, 
congressional Democrats must 
take it and work to maximize 
the reforms that could be 
enacted. Moreover, none of 
this is to say voting rights 
cannot and should not be 
addressed whenever possible, 
as they clearly should. If 
Democrats manage to win 
at least two Senate seats in 
upcoming 
midterms, 
their 

voting 
rights 
and 
election 

reform bills will have a real 
chance of passing, so long as 
they can hold the House. But 
as the last few months have 
shown, that option is closed at 
the moment, and it would be 
irresponsible and dangerous 
not to take whatever electoral 
reform they can now, a sizable 
amount at that.

H

ow do you talk to your 
roommates 
about 

COVID-19 safety? I’m 

nervous about cases spiking and 
want to make sure we’re all on the 
same page. – H

Hi H! I think it’s good to 

center the conversation around 
the rising cases and how your 
behaviors should change in 
response. Start by bringing up 
your feelings around COVID-19, 
then get into how you would like 
yourself and your roommates to 
respond. Ask them about how 
they’re 
feeling. 
Be 
specific: 

Fewer 
people 
visiting 
your 

space? More frequent testing? I 
think one of the most important 
topics to address is what to 
do if someone gets COVID-
19. Will that person move into 
quarantine 
housing? 
Will 

the rest of your roommates 
quarantine? 
Whatever 
your 

goals are, frame them as things 
both your roommates and you 
can do, instead of asking for 
changes from your roommates 
alone. 
Even 
if 
they’re 
less 

concerned about COVID-19 than 
you are, it’s not unreasonable 
to ask for more precautions. If 
you’re concerned about possibly 

upsetting your roommates, I 
don’t think this conversation 
needs to be confrontational at all 
— as long as you’re honest about 
your feelings and goals. 

I think my roommate might 

have a crush on me. What do I 
do? We get along really well, but 
I’m in a really happy relationship 
already. I don’t think she would 
act on it, so should I just ignore 
it? – B ’25 (she/they)

Hi B! Admittedly, that’s a 

tough one, but I think there 
are several ways to approach 
this. We can’t control who we 
develop feelings for, but we 
can control how we handle 
the situation. Assuming you’re 
right about your roommate’s 
feelings, the responsible thing 
on their part would be to respect 
your relationship and not act 
on their feelings. In this case, 
I would suggest leaving the 
situation alone and allowing 
your roommate space to work 
through 
their 
feelings. 
If 

they’re acting more flirtatious 
and you’re concerned about it 
affecting your friendship, it 
might be better to talk with 
them about their feelings. I’ll 
be honest, it will probably be 
awkward at first, but in this 
case, I think it would be best to 
be open so both of you can be on 
the same page. 

The paradox of choice – I feel 

like I’m having a very hard time 
settling down and committing 
to someone because I’m always 
worried about something better 
coming along, or that I’ll like 
someone else I’m talking to more. 
How do I get over that? – L ’24 
(she/her)

Hi L! I think it’s important 

to 
explore 
your 
options 

before getting into a serious 
relationship. Go on multiple 
casual 
dates 
with 
different 

people and see who you connect 
with the most. I think once you 
find someone that you really 
connect with, you shouldn’t 
find yourself being so concerned 
with the possibility of someone 
better. If you’re worried about 
finding 
someone 
else, 
then 

maybe it’s a sign that whoever 
you’re with isn’t working out. 
Be honest about your feelings 
and don’t rush into anything just 
because you feel obligated. I’d 
also suggest working through 
these 
concerns 
while 
you 

navigate the dating scene. What 
would something “better” look 
like? Would you feel trapped in 
a relationship? You’re never tied 
down to someone, but I hope 
that when you find someone, 
you feel confident about your 
feelings and unbothered by the 
thought of other possibilities.

JENNA HICKEY/Daily 

Michigan isn’t a good team, but late in the season, it is making 
some strides toward getting better.

Women’s tennis optimistic despite 

loss to UNC

Entering 
Saturday’s 
match 

against North Carolina, Michigan 
women’s tennis coach Ronni Ber-
nstein was just a single win shy of 
becoming the winningest coach in 
program history.

The 
Wolverines, 
however, 

couldn’t deliver Bernstein her 
record-setting win. That accom-
plishment will have to come anoth-
er day as Michigan (3-2 overall) 
couldn’t handle the constant pres-
sure from the star-studded Tar 
Heels (7-0) in a 5-2 loss. 

According to Bernstein, UNC is 

the best team the Wolverines have 
seen so far. Five of its six singles 
players are ranked — including 
four in the top 20 — and it has six 
ranked doubles pairs.

“We switched around our 

teams a little bit and had some 
chances,” Bernstein said. “We 
knew we probably needed to go 
out and get that doubles point.”

While Michigan brought ener-

gy during doubles play by chant-
ing and calling out to the crowd, 
it ultimately couldn’t overcome 
the Tar Heels’ firepower. UNC set 
the pace and the Wolverines were 
unable to keep up, dropping the 
No. 1 and No. 2 doubles matches.

Soon after, at No. 1 singles, 

Michigan sophomore Kari Miller 
took the stage. Ranked 17th in the 
country, Miller looked to main-
tain team morale. She swept the 
first set over fifth-ranked senior 
Cameron Morra while constantly 
cheering on her teammates beside 
her.

Morra, though, stepped up 

her game in the following set. 
She unleashed a flat serve that 
painted the corner of the court, 

then switched it up with a top-
spin serve that kicked so hard it 
changed direction on impact.

“I told her after the first set, 

(Morra’s) probably going to get 
better and start making more 
balls,” Bernstein said. “And she 
did, and Kari wasn’t ready for 
that.”

Miller struggled to find the 

same success she had in the 
first set, but she remained calm. 
Finding the occasional open-
ing, she secured two games with 
finesse but ultimately lost the 
set, 2-6.

As Morra smashed the ball 

with her characteristic double-
handed forehand, Miller stopped 
cheering on her teammates to 

hone her focus on the opponent in 
front of her.

After narrowly conceding the 

first game and squeaking by the 
second, Miller’s defense became 
impeccable. She dug out ball after 
ball until Morra would make a 
mistake. Then, she capitalized 
with a well placed shot to win the 
point. 

After losing that first game, 

Miller won six straight. She cel-
ebrated with her signature “On!” 
as she took down one of the high-
est-ranked singles players in the 
country.

But while Miller battled at No. 

1, the Tar Heels swept the No. 2, 
No. 4 and No. 5 singles to clinch 
the victory.

Wins from Miller and sopho-

more Gala Mesochoritou at No. 
6 brought some excitement, but 
it didn’t last long. Junior Andrea 
Cerdan fell promptly in consecu-
tive games to end the longest 
match of the event, reminding 
the spectators at the Varsity 
Tennis Center of the match’s 
outcome.

Bernstein, though, remained 

optimistic for the team’s future 
— and that her milestone win will 
come soon.

“Hopefully this will give us 

confidence,” Bernstein said. “We 
have to play teams like this and 
see where we stand, and hope-
fully against California we’ll be 
ready.”

For The Daily

Miller and Mesochoritou are lone bright spots in loss to UNC

Everyone loves a good underdog 

story.

On Saturday, sophomores Kara 

Miller and Gala Mesochoritou 
were underdogs who earned the 
No. 20 Michigan women’s tennis 
team its only two points in a 5-2 
loss to No. 2 North Carolina.

Miller, ranked No. 17 in the 

nation, was coming off her first 
dual-match win her last time out 
against Georgia Tech. She looked 
to carry the momentum from that 
win into her No. 1 singles match 
against the Tar Heels’ Cameron 
Morra— the fifth-ranked player in 
the nation.

Miller came out firing. Main-

taining 
a 
constant 
pressure 

throughout the first set, she was 
able to secure a 6-0 sweep to take 
a lead. She faltered in the second 
set, though, as Morra came back 
and took an early 3-0 lead. Trying 
to mount a comeback, Miller was 
able to take the next two sets, yet 
ultimately fell 6-2. But in the third 
set, she was able to bounce back, 
powering her way to a 6-1 win and 
securing the upset victory.

“She lost a little bit of momen-

tum right in the middle there,” 
Michigan coach Ronni Bernstein 
said. “She competes so hard and 
after losing the second set, she 
regrouped and played a great 
third set. Really great.”

Despite having a fantastic first 

set, Miller really showcased her 
skills in the third set. Morra, car-
rying the energy from her second-
set win and shaking off the tough 
first-set loss, delivered a barrage 
of powerful slams, each one get-
ting faster than the previous. 
The pressure didn’t get to Miller, 
though, as she kept her compo-
sure and consistently matched 
Morra’s intensity.

On the opposite side of the 

complex was sophomore Gala 
Mesochoritou at No. 6 singles, 
who continued to prove that the 
ACL injury she suffered in 2021 
was not going to hold her back. 
Her elite performance reminded 
everyone of the level she played 
at before her injury, when she 
went undefeated in 17 singles 

matches.

“Gala at 6, coming back from 

what she’s been through, was a 
fantastic lift for us,” Bernstein 
said.

Mesochoritou took the match 

in straight sets, ending with a 6-3 
first set win and a hard-fought 7-5 
second-set win. This win secured 
the Wolverines’ first point and 
provided a much-needed morale 
boost for the rest of the team.

Although Michigan fans didn’t 

see the upset they craved, they 
got a fantastic showing from 
two young, promising athletes. 
Despite being the underdogs in 
their respective matches, they 
persevered 
and 
proved 
that 

there’s a bright season ahead for 
the Wolverines.

ZACHARY XU
For The Daily

SportsWednesday: Against 

Purdue, Michigan’s 
problems look dulled

Sports writing is rife with 

metaphors. 

The offense went quiet in 

the last quarter. It was a David 
and Goliath matchup. They 
were 
the 
Cinderella 

story of the year. 

Here’s another cli-

che for you: The Mich-
igan men’s basketball 
team was expected to 
come out of the gates 
running at the start 
of this season. Now, at 
the beginning of Feb-
ruary, the Wolverines 
are just learning to 
walk. 

On Saturday against Pur-

due, Michigan put up one of 
its strongest offensive perfor-
mances of the season. Despite 
the 
loss, 
the 
Wolverines 

showed that they are capable 
of putting together the pieces 
that have been there all year. 

Thus far, Michigan has been 

– to put it nicely – inconsis-
tent for a myriad of reasons: 
The bench hasn’t been able to 
contribute. It hasn’t found a 
second reliable shooter outside 
of sophomore big man Hunter 
Dickinson. It hasn’t been able 
to hold onto momentum and 
make meaningful scoring runs, 
either. 

But, 
against 
the 
Boiler-

makers, all of those problems 
looked subdued.

Towards the end of the first 

half, the Wolverines’ backup 
players 
showed 
their 
first 

signs of life. Already facing a 
hefty deficit by the middle of 
the first half, Michigan coach 
Juwan Howard turned to the 
bench. The backups put up 13 
points, including two shots 
from behind the arc from 
freshman guard Kobe Bufkin 
and senior forward Brandon 
Johns Jr. 

“We always want big pro-

duction out of our bench,” 
Michigan 
assistant 
coach 

Howard Eisley told reporters 
on Monday. “We don’t want 
to have to rely on our starters, 
not only for big production but 
to carry a heavy minute load 
… production that we can get 
off the bench is always wanted 
and needed.”

It was by no means an amaz-

ing showing — especially com-
pared to Purdue’s 21 points in 
the same category — but it was 
still a marked improvement 
from the Wolverines’ average 
of eight bench points across 
their three most recent games. 

Dickinson also had a superb 

day. He racked up 28 points 
– his most so far this season 
– and was 2-for-3 from deep. 
Not only did Dickinson look 

like the offensive power-
house Michigan expect-
ed — and needed — him 
to be at the beginning of 
the season, but he also 
managed to stay out of 
foul trouble. 

The added offensive 

firepower 
seemed 
to 

make 
the 
Wolverines 

more resilient. Despite 
the 
Boilermakers’ 

aggressive offense all the way 
through, Michigan wouldn’t 
let the game get out of hand, 
keeping it close until the very 
end. 

“Basketball is about runs,” 

Howard said. “You try to pre-
vent your opponent from scor-
ing zero points but realistically 
(that) is not going to happen. 
And then teams want to make 
shots, and they’re going to 
make shots sometimes.”

None of this erases the fact 

that the Wolverines lost by six 
and never led in the game. This 
isn’t the team that kept fans 
glued to their TVs last season, 
each game solidifying visions 
of a Final Four appearance.

This team is at risk of not 

making the NCAA Tournament 
and holds a 5-5 Big Ten record. 
It’s not a team that’s going to 
win the Big Ten. It’s not a team 
that’s going to have a meaning-
ful postseason run. 

But making strides this late 

in the season says something 
not just about this team but, 
more importantly, about How-
ard and his ability to adapt. 

There are a lot of ways to 

make a winning team, whether 
it’s a couple dominant scor-
ers or a well-rounded lineup 
or militant defense. Michigan 
doesn’t have any of these, but 
Howard isn’t done trying to 
put the pieces together. 

This won’t be a team that 

sprints towards a National 
Championship but, on Satur-
day, it proved that there’s still 
room to improve before it hits 
the finish line. 

“I applaud them for what 

they have been able to endure 
throughout the season,” he 
said. “And — by the way —the 
season isn’t over.”

Who knows? Maybe the Wol-

verines will take this walk and 
turn it into a respectable jog.

Michigan narrowly falls in tight battle vs No. 19 Harvard

LANE 

KIZZIAH

JEREMY WEINE/Daily 

Michigan ended its three-game road stand with a 4-3 loss to Har-
vard.

Side-by-side, 
sophomore 

Jacob Bickersteth and junior 
Ondrej Styler — the No. 17 Mich-
igan men’s tennis team’s No. 2 
and No. 3 singles — fought tooth-
and-nail for three sets in unfa-
miliar territory. Left to battle 
for more than an hour, neither 
was able to capture the third-set 
victory needed for the Wolver-
ines to clinch a victory over No. 
19 Harvard, leading to a narrow 
4-3 loss.

“Ondrej is sometimes a big 

brother out there for Jacob,” 
Michigan coach Adam Steinberg 
said. “They had a great connec-
tion and fought together but just 
came up short.”

Two vastly different stories 

trailed Bickersteth and Sty-
ler heading into this duel with 
Harvard. Bickersteth entered 
on a roll, sporting a 4-0 spring 
singles record. His three most 
recent wins came at the Wol-
verines’ No. 2 spot, while Styler 
made his first appearance back 
in Michigan’s lineup since the 
team’s season-opening faceoff 
against Virginia Tech on Jan. 
16.

Due to a left wrist injury he 

re-aggravated versus the Hok-
ies, Styler was forced to adjust 
his left backhand to a slice in 

order to continue rallies. Even 
then, he came back from a first-
set loss to defeat Harvard’s Har-
ris Walker, 7-5, in the second and 
rebounded from a 1-4 deficit to 
narrowly lose the final set, 4-6.

“When I was left on the court 

for the match’s deciding point, 
my teammates were there for 
me,” Stylez said.

Not only were Styler’s team-

mates there to support him until 
his final point, but they also set 
the stage for his match to decide 
the Wolverines’ fate.

After losing the doubles 

point when its No. 2 — senior 
Patrick Maloney/Bickersteth — 
and No. 3 — sophomore Gavin 
Young/freshman Will Cook-
sey — doubles pairs fell 5-7 and 
4-6, respectively, Michigan fell 
in an 0-2 hole. The Wolverines 
then lost another point when 
senior Andrew Fenty fell to 
No. 17-ranked Henry von der 
Schulenburg 4-6, 1-6. Before 
his 
singles 
match, though, 

Fenty and sophomore Nino 
Ehrenschneider teamed up to 
complete an impressive victory 
over Harvard’s No. 11-ranked 
pair of Brian Shi and Daniel 
Milavsky.

Michigan quickly bounced 

back to capture a 3-2 lead with 
straight-set victories from No. 
4 singles Maloney, No. 5 singles 
Young and No. 6 singles Ehren-
schneider. Maloney and Young 

each improved their spring 
singles records this year to 4-1, 
while Ehrenschneider went to 
3-2 on the season.

“I was playing a little behind 

Pat,” Young said. “But I was 
able to boost my energy when I 
looked to my right and saw him 
winning as well. I thought I was 
serving well, and I was able to 
capitalize on my return games 
too.”

Despite the loss, Styler’s fight 

through his injury is emblematic 
of the dedication he has always 
brought during his three years 
at Michigan.

“I found a way to compete 

with all of these great players 
with no backhand, and that’s 

a huge foundation for my con-
fidence going into the next 
match,” Styler said. “I enjoy and 
cherish every moment that I 
have on the court.”

Through this close loss to 

Harvard, the Wolverines remain 
steadfast 
in 
seeking 
victo-

ries moving forward, no mat-
ter where they are slotted in 
on match day. The narrowness 
of the loss only increases that 
determination.

“Wherever Coach needs me in 

the lineup, I’ll be ready to show 
up and give my best effort,” 
Young said. “Where I’m placed 
in the singles lineup is just a 
number.”

One month and a lifetime ago, 

Jim Harbaugh sat at a podium with a 
backdrop of College Football Playoff 
logos, expressing vigorous optimism 
for the future of the Michigan foot-
ball program.

“It’s still a beginning for this 

team,” Harbaugh waxed, his outlook 
unchanged in the wake of Georgia’s 
23-point drubbing in the Orange 
Bowl. “That’s when it began last year, 
and it’ll begin anew this year. Start of 
a new year.”

Harbaugh continued, his voice 

firm.

“To me, it feels like a start. Feels 

like a beginning.”

A beginning, indeed.
In a stunning turn of events, 

Harbaugh will return to Michigan 
for the 2022 season. He informed 
an “elated” Warde Manuel of his 
decision Wednesday evening, on 
the heels of traveling to Minnesota 
to interview for the Vikings’ head 
coaching vacancy earlier that day. 
After a month-long craze of NFL 
rumors and boundless speculation, 
Harbaugh will remain in Ann Arbor. 

Each of Harbaugh’s seven years 

as the Wolverines’ coach began with 
the same tired song and dance: Will 
Harbaugh leave? Baseless rumors 
swirled. TV personalities and pun-
dits prattled alike. It was, if anything, 
a tired yet entertaining ritual.

Each time, Harbaugh remained 

in place.

Though interest from the NFL 

hardly waned, the sentiment was 
unrequited. Harbaugh had yet to 

accomplish what he first set out to 
do.

In 2014, at his introductory press 

conference, 
Harbaugh 
deflected 

questions about expectations. In typ-
ical Harbaugh-speak, he preferred to 
stress the importance of the first day 
of practice, the first meeting and the 
first week at his new job. One day at 
a time.

But, to borrow a phrase from 

Harbaugh’s vernacular, sometimes 
the questions answer themselves. 
The expectations were already set 
in stone; the beloved former quar-
terback had come home to rescue 
Michigan’s sputtering football pro-
gram from the abyss. Harbaugh — 
ballyhooed, quirky and charismatic 
— would be the savior.

It took seven long years, a herky-

jerky roller coaster ride of thrill and 
disappointment, for that vision to 
materialize. But this past year felt 
like a climax, Harbaugh’s program 
at last delivering upon the unspoken 
promise. He vanquished Ohio State, 
captured a Big Ten Championship 
and led Michigan’s inaugural foray 
into the College Football Playoff. He 
had, at last, returned the Wolver-
ines to their long-vacant spot on the 
sport’s grandest stage. 

In 
December, 
underneath 
a 

drizzle of maize and blue confetti, 
Harbaugh stood triumphantly on a 
makeshift stage and reached deep 
into his soul to unleash a “Go Blue” 
that rang throughout Lucas Oil Sta-
dium. He hoisted the coveted Big 
Ten Championship trophy high 
above his head, a Christmas-morn-
ing grin plastered across his face. 
Charles Woodson joined him for a 
resounding rendition of “The Vic-

tors,” beckoning cheers from the 
giddy Michigan faithful on hand. 
This felt like the glory days; this was 
pure euphoria. 

As of Wednesday morning, the 

growing consensus was that the 
moment would become a culmina-
tion of Harbaugh’s Michigan tenure, 
his final triumph as a Wolverine. 
NFL interest appeared to be build-
ing to a crescendo. Tuesday evening, 
reports surfaced that Harbaugh to 
Minnesota was a formality; he had 
allegedly exchanged a handful of 
“goodbyes” and “thank yous.”

Harbaugh is 58. NFL interest 

won’t last forever; much of it is tied to 
his year-to-year success at Michigan. 
These past two seasons — a 2-4 cam-
paign followed by a Big Ten Champi-
onship — certainly emphasized the 
sport’s fickle nature.

On the heels of the Wolverines’ 

best season in decades, one that Har-
baugh rightfully called one of the 
best in the storied program’s history, 
Harbaugh’s personal stock may have 
never been higher. NFL speculation 
long inundated Harbaugh because 
people had a hard time believing he 
could live without chasing that cov-
eted Lombardi Trophy again. Temp-
tation, then, made sense. Perhaps the 
lightbulb never died. 

But it certainly flickered. And 

with Harbaugh informing Manuel 
that NFL speculation would not 
become a reoccurring issue, effec-
tively deciding to commit to Michi-
gan for the long-term, it appears to 
have died. 

Few disputed Harbaugh’s proc-

lamation that this was merely the 
start, a full-fledged restoration of a 
sleeping national power. It’s an ardu-

ous task to stack successful seasons 
in college football, particularly in 
the Big Ten. But everything seemed 
to be trending upwards for the Wol-
verines, a revelation following years 
of tumult. 

This time last year, without sig-

nificant NFL interest, Harbaugh 
preoccupied himself by overhauling 
the program’s culture with a youth-
ful coaching staff, a seismic shift that 
paid immense and immediate divi-
dends. In December, he capitalized on 
Michigan’s on-field momentum with 
a top-10 recruiting class and seemed 
poised to reel in touted prospects in 
droves. Michigan’s future was tied to 
a tantalizing nucleus of young talent, 
headlined by freshmen J.J. McCarthy 
and Donovan Edwards and sopho-
more Blake Corum.

And Harbaugh himself appeared 

revitalized. His quips — about 
George Patton and Neil Armstrong, 
about “Clint Eastwood wins” — 
returned with fervor. He seemed, 
at last, genuinely happy. This was 
the Harbaugh who wanted to wear 
cleats into the Mormon church, 
who orchestrated sleepovers with 
recruits, who waged war on SEC sat-
ellite camps, who reveled in his fic-
tional character Freddy P. Soft. This 
Harbaugh brought the old Michigan 
back with him.

Now?
It’s all here to stay.
Michigan’s 
disastrous 
perfor-

mance in the Orange Bowl revealed 
just how far the Wolverines, as a pro-
gram, have to go to entrench them-
selves in college football’s upper 
echelon. A product of the many 
inequities that mar college football, 
there’s a chasm between mere play-

off contenders and championship 
contenders, and Michigan has yet to 
cross it. Harbaugh knows that. Of the 
many traits that Harbaugh embod-
ies, ignorance is not one of them. 

It’s impossible to overstate how 

losing Harbaugh may have cratered 
this program. Michigan is littered 
with people — current players, 
incoming recruits, high school pros-
pects, assistant coaches — whom 
Harbaugh sold on a vision. He con-
vinced them that he would take care 
of them, that he would ascend them 
to new heights, that he would usher 
them from boys to men. 

When those promises are stripped, 

loyalty often goes with it. Perhaps, in 
the alternate universe in which Har-
baugh leaves, the doomsday scenario 
never materializes. But it’s difficult 
to imagine this beginning, absent the 
man who patented it. 

With Harbaugh in tow, the proc-

lamation is alive and well. 

Goalposts have shifted. Michigan, 

finally, is over the hump. If this is a 
beginning, then Harbaugh’s vision 
lies on the other side, beyond resto-
ration and into sustainment, a pro-
longed stay in the upper echelon as 
opposed to a guest pass. That carries 
with it a new set of goals for Har-
baugh to accomplish in the second 
stage of his tenure.

Perhaps Michigan permanently 

closes the gap with Ohio State, capi-
talizing on the program’s surge on 
the recruiting trail and vibrant cul-
ture. Perhaps the Wolverines restore 
their glory days. Perhaps they crack 
that elusive group of championship 
contenders, joining Clemson, Ala-
bama and Georgia with a spot at the 
sport’s most coveted dinner table.

We can’t be certain which path 

Michigan will follow. All we know is 
that there’s no time for a honeymoon.

Harbaugh has to find a pair of 

new coordinators, with Mike Mac-
donald and Josh Gattis each moving 
on. Replacing Macdonald, the archi-
tect of the defensive restoration and 
someone whom players touted as a 
genius, is arduous. Gattis’s shoes, too, 
are large; while his “speed in space” 
proclamation never truly material-
ized, Michigan’s offense blossomed 
into one of the nation’s best under 
Gattis’s watch this past season. It’s 
not easy finding two heirs in the 
same offseason, let alone this late in 
the cycle, with spring ball looming in 
March. 

And yet, with Harbaugh here to 

stay, those glaring holes at coordinator 
feel, at least in part, moot. Michigan 
has a legitimate shot to turn all of those 
above hypotheticals into reality. With-
out Harbaugh, they are mere fantasies.

At the aforementioned introduc-

tory press conference, Harbaugh 
likened his different coaching desti-
nations to building houses. At each 
stop — first San Diego, then Stanford, 
then the 49ers — Harbaugh had built 
what he called “pretty nice homes,” 
doing so from the ground up.

At Michigan, though, he aspired 

for more. A beginning, but not neces-
sarily an end.

“I would really like to live in one 

permanently,” Harbaugh said, fully 
immersed in his metaphor. “That’s 
what I’m very hopeful for here.”

A chorus of applause followed. 
Seven years later, as the Wolver-

ines grapple with this new reality, so 
will Harbaugh. He can finally move 
in for good.

Can’t Buy 
Me Love
Can’t Buy 
Me Love

What is love? Scientists explain it in terms of 

the body’s release of adrenaline, dopamine and 
serotonin; cynics refute its existence by citing 
ancient philosophy. The Greeks had six words 
to describe it, whereas Merriam Webster offers 
a simple definition. More recently, a Hallmark 
card asserted that love is when you find “the 
sprinkled donut in a sea of glazed.” 

Whatever it may be, the complexity of “love” 

opens the arena for many interpretations and 
ways of expression. It is an intangible feeling 
that we seek to materialize through tangible 
exchanges, much like how our desire to consume 
is expressed via the transaction of paper money. 

Therefore, “punny” cards depicting talking 

donuts, a cherub with a quiver of arrows and cen-
turies of heart-shaped anything are the expected 
form of currency when transacting love come 
Feb. 14 — a currency made of paper, measured in 
chocolate and scented like a rose. 

 It has been over a millennium since Feb. 14 

was formally recognized for a martyred Catholic 
priest and an estimated 545 years since the earli-
est surviving valentine was sent to its lovestruck 
recipient. 

Love — whatever it means — has been 

expressed since the dawn of time, with paper 
love notes serving as a common source. Love 
is a feeling, a drive; a motivator, a risk. Love is 
everything that you can feel yet everything you 
can’t touch. Hence, there is one designated day 
each year that gives us the chance to materialize 
said feeling, where valentines attempt to express 
their “eros” using Cupid as their guide. Under his 
direction, the currency of love has maintained 
its medium of paper, creased with a crisp cen-
terfold, patterned with a red filigree design and 
sealed with a kiss. 

Valentine’s Day became popular in the U.S. 

during the 1840s, when increased paper produc-
tion and the proliferation of the printing press 
allowed for pre-printed notes featuring iconic 
love birds, bright red hearts and our favorite “god 
of love.” Specifically, Esther Howland is accred-
ited with making Valentine’s Day a business after 
transforming her stationary art into a monopo-
listic essential for American lovers. Put simply: 
Love went commercial. 

Howland sold many of her creations for the 

high price of 75 cents (the equivalent of $100 
today), embossing each note with her signa-
ture “H.” Howland’s work was an artistic, tan-
gible symbol of love and an early example of the 
importance of branding in shaping social and 
cultural trends. 

Early cards often featured short greetings and 

poems that juxtaposed playful flirtation with 
biting humor. Luxury cards, like Howland’s, fea-
tured wafered paper pressed to mimic lace, over-
laid with precious gold foil and colored paper 
cutouts. They were intricate pieces of art, art that 
required much creative thought and intention — 
and all of an average American’s daily salary. 

For the superfluous valentine, though, hand-

made cards highlighted the sentimentality of the 
sender, saving pennies while creating a spark. To 
some, a man who can write his own poem was 
more wooing than one who can simply open his 
wallet. 

To explore the historic commodification 

of love and its place in popular culture, I spoke 
with Dr. Elizabeth White Nelson, University of 
Nevada, Las Vegas professor and cultural his-
torian of 19th century America. Her research 
supports that romantic relationships of the 19th 
century were characterized by a focus on eco-
nomics — valentines serving as a “broker.” The 
trading of cards was a testament of wealth and 
devotion, recording fraught issues of love and 
marriage on paper. 

And while the circulation of cards may have 

been born out of pure, heart-beating inten-
tions by entrepreneurs like Howland, they soon 
became a symbol of status. After all, middle-class 
women of the 19th and 20th centuries had to 
consider the relationship between romantic love 
and the economic reality; the alternative of mar-
riage being work in factories or mills. The holiday 
was a way to test the viability of said reality, using 
heart-shaped materialism as a measurement of 
future stability. The currency of love was a cur-
rency for survival, a notion that may have stuck. 

Now, Valentine’s Day marks the main day of 

the year in which singles and couples alike sub-
ject themselves to both cupid’s arrow and the 
card aisle, using materialism to mimic stability in 
both a financial and emotional lens. 145 million 

cards travel from hand to hand every year and a 
mere $21.8 billion dollars is projected to be spent 
on gifts this Feb. 14. Red roses are the staple flow-
er in every bouquet order, heart-shaped boxes of 
chocolate are an ancient aphrodisiac that can’t 
stay on the shelves — each gift accompanied with 
a love note. 

Talking avocados, cartoon cats and sexual 

innuendos make up many card designs nowa-
days, supplementing long-held romantic motifs 
with evolving visual fads. Yet to Dr. White Nel-
son, while the material symbols of love may have 
lost some sophistication, “we are still struggling 
with love in the same way.” 

The evolution of card exchange is an ever-

changing quest for materializing love, a never-
ending haste to commodify a feeling. Hence, 
shifts in romantic, socio-cultural trends caused 
by reduced disposable income levels and the 
deconstruction of heteronormativity reveal 
that the true underpinnings of Valentine’s Day 
and the act of giving cards may have never been 
about love in the first place. Instead, it is about 
defining comfort within a relationship through 
an element of tangible risk; a risk of love and a 
relationship hidden behind the front of a mis-
chievous cupid or talking donut. A risk not need-
ed solely between a man and a woman or under 
a sizeable budget. 

This risk is partly what inspired Dr. White 

Nelson’s research: “you’ll find someone who has 
a charming and lovely valentine story, but most 
Valentine’s stories are of heartbreak and fear and 
concern and disdain for the holiday as insincere.” 
This is likely because “we feel both drawn to the 
idea that goods can speak for us and uncomfort-
able with the idea that we don’t control them.” 

Cards can therefore be viewed as an invita-

tion to romantic love, an invitation that has the 
opportunity to be declined or embraced. While 
cards may not in essence be an all-encompassing 
embodiment of love, they are in fact a currency 
of it. A currency that is difficult to standardize — 
something that has been grappled with for cen-
turies. 

Ann Arbor, at one point rated one of the coun-

try’s most romantic cities, has hosted count-
less card exchanges and budding relationships, 

spreading love throughout campus and within 
the lecture halls. 

Archived within the Bentley Historical 

Library are scrapbooks featuring students’ paper 
love, dating from the early 1900s onward. Many 
feature rosy-cheeked cupid, others: cartoon sil-
verware. 

Yet, cards were not always the premier mode 

of Valentine’s gift-giving on campus. In fact, the 
1939 Valentine’s Day edition of The Michigan 
Daily touted love notes as a “stale” form of “com-
mercialized sentimentality,” suggesting instead 
a $2 horse-drawn tour around Washtenaw coun-
ty. The 1951 edition cited “decreasing money and 
decreasing chivalry” as the cause of lessened 
card exchanges, two years later stating that 
“people with enemies are more likely to receive 
[valentines] than people with friends.” 

Pre-made cards with lackluster poems were 

no longer causing a spark. If not a card, what is 
the way to our hearts? 

The 1987 edition advertised a heart-shaped 

pizza from the Brown Jug and a couples getaway 
to the Bahamas with the ingenious tagline “A 
day in the library? Or a day in paradise?” By 2022 
standards, Kay Jewelers claims a lab-created 
pink opal heart ring is the perfect gift, presented 
with a card depicting hugging blocks of cheese 
with the caption “Will you brie my valentine?” 

Such evolution in gift-giving, ranging from 

spiteful valentines to romantic cheese, exposes 
the varying, and somewhat comical, generation-
al attempts in pinpointing the materialization 
of love — something seen within our own city. 
There is no return to the “good old days” where 
love spread with sincerity, unaffected by capi-
talism or social demands; history provides cor-
roboration. Despite subtle changes in gift-giving 
or card circulation, what remains constant is the 
tangible risks of expressing love coupled with the 
reliance on shops and card aisles to commercial-
ize sentimentality. As a result, business execu-
tives and card designers are (and have always 
been) sticking their noses in our romantic busi-
ness. Gross!

Fathers, daughters 
and daddies

Necto, TikTok, And the importance of queer spaces

Fathers, daughters 
and daddies

Necto, TikTok, And the importance of queer spaces

When thinking about father-daughter rela-

tionships, unfortunately, there is no “dad” without 
a “daddy.”

Since entering our collective vocabulary, 

terms like “daddy issues,” “fatherless behavior” 
and “father complex” have dominated the ways 
we discuss the complex relationships between 
women and their dads. All the difficulty, nuance 
and complications that exist in these relationships 
flattened into a singular, sexually tainted dimen-
sion: daddy. 

This linguistic minimization means that any 

mention of the term triggers its associations with 
daddy kinks, if not outright discussions of sex. 
In a way, daddy has gone mainstream. The pod-
cast “Call Her Daddy” has received criticism and 
acclaim for its unfiltered discussion of sex. The 
“Daddy Gang,” aka the fans of the show, number 
in the millions and eagerly await host Alex Coo-
per’s vulgar commentary each week. 

But what are “daddy issues?” The top entry in 

Urban Dictionary defines it as “when a girl has a 
messed up relationship with her dad. usually the 
fathers fault. either he left or is acting like a total 
bitch.”

The page goes on to define an array of causes: 

child abuse, neglect, absent or emotionally 

unavailable fathers. It’s purposefully imprecise, 
encapsulating a range of traumas and experienc-
es only loosely tied together through the common 
thread of fathers. “Daddy issues” is convenient; 
any traumatic experience or unresolved feeling 
can fall under the catch-all term. At best it’s an 
unwillingness to precisely name and identify our 
experiences; at worst it’s a misogynistic assump-
tion that these women have had the same experi-
ence — or at least similar enough ones — and can 
be lumped together. 

Daddy issues seem to mean something differ-

ent to everyone. When I was introduced to the 
term, a friend told me that it didn’t apply to me 
because my dad was still alive. I simultaneously 
was relieved and annoyed upon hearing this. No 
girl wants to be labelled as having daddy issues; I 
certainly didn’t identify myself that way. But it felt 
like it was the only language there was to describe 
imperfect paternal relationships.

The relief was only temporary. That was just my 

friend’s subjective interpretation of daddy issues; 
later, others would tell me that emotional unavail-
ability did, in fact, qualify. The precise meaning of 
the term never became clear to me. Anytime my 
friends and I tried to psychoanalyze our relation-
ships with our fathers, we came to conflicting 

con-

clu-

sions, 
each of us 
pointing 
toward a 
different 
aspect 
of daddy 
issues to justify our observation. 

Throughout my adult life, I’ve struggled to 

define and understand my relationship with my 
father on my own terms. No matter how hard I 
try to make sense of my feelings and experiences, 
every conversation eventually turns to the same, 
empty idea: “You know, lots of girls have daddy 
issues.” But it couldn’t be that simple. 

***

Growing up, I heard variations of the same 

refrain over and over again: “I thought your mom 
was raising you alone?” “I’ve never seen your dad 
before.” “Your parents are still together?”

I never quite know how to talk about my dad. 

My dad is 62 years old. He has a collection of vin-
tage snowmobiles and pretends to dislike our cats. 
I inherited my nose and my addiction to diet soda 
from him, but unlike me, he prefers Coke to Pepsi. 

Still, all that feels too fac-
tual. 

The truth is that my dad was 

physically present during my child-
hood but for the most part, he was emotion-
ally unavailable. Our relationship existed on a 
superficial plane of awkward family dinners 
a few times a year, attending parents’ night at 
school and changing the oil in my car.

 It was nice, I guess. These interactions 

reminded me that he cared. But there was 
never any emotional closeness that came 
with it, and I grew resentful of his disinter-
est in me.

I went to my first fraternity formal in February 

of my freshman year, and I sat in Chatime, sipping 
my roasted milk black tea with pearls while wait-
ing to head over. I was petrified.

When I was in grade school in rural Texas, I 

didn’t have many parties or social events that were 
clearly designated as LGBTQ+ friendly spaces. But 
on this night during my first year in Ann Arbor, I 
could tell that things were different. There was a 

guy waiting for me at the ADPhi fraternity and he 
had assured me that no one there would give me 
shit if I came with him — even if we were together, 
even if we were gay. The thought of being with a 
guy at a public event was electrifying: It felt taboo 
and daring, especially in front of frat guys, people 
who I didn’t immediately associate with queer 
acceptance. 

To my surprise, I ended up having a wonder-

ful 
night, 

dancing and 
talking 
to 

people 
and 

playing vari-
ous 
games. 

Most of the 
girls 
were 

very cordial 
and kind to 
me, even if 
many of the 
guys 
were 

not. 
I 
felt 

myself being 
stared down 
from 
every 

corner of the 

room, as if I were a spy infiltrating somewhere 
that I shouldn’t and they were onto me. Regard-
less, the guy that I was with made me feel weight-
less, ending the night by leading me up to the 
balcony of the frat house where bubbly beverages 
and candles were prepared. We danced to “I’ll Be 
Seeing You” by Billie Holiday before he whispered 
to me: 

“Happy Valentine’s Day.”
After that, I was curious to know where there 

were other places where I could openly dance 
with other guys without frat guys staring me 
down. It’s something I still wonder. 

I recently typed “gay bar” into Ann Arbor 

Google Maps to see what would come up and 
was surprised by the result. The closest loca-
tion was a place called “Boylesque Drag,” which 
is approximately 7.7 miles away from my house 
in Kerrytown. The rest of these LGBTQ+ spaces 
were peppered throughout Ypsilanti and mostly 
concentrated in Detroit. I was shocked: It seemed 
strange that such a large university setting only 
offered Friday nights at Necto for queer nightlife 
environments.

I then Googled to see if there were any venues 

that had recently closed. The only establishment 
that I could find was “Aut Bar,” which closed 

about two years ago at the start of the pandemic 
after being open for 25 years. Unfortunately, the 
decrease in LGBTQ+ establishments is not unique 
to the Ann Arbor area — surprisingly enough, the 
trend of gay bars closing manifested itself long 
before the pandemic.

Across the United States, gay bar listings have 

declined 36.6% between the years of 2007 and 
2019, according to a study by Oberlin College’s 
Gregor Mattson. 

The study reads that, “The number of listings 

for bars serving people of color declined by 59.3 
percent, cruisy men’s bar listings declined by 47.5 
percent and bars for women declined by 51.6 per-
cent.” 

Of course, the pandemic has waged its impact 

against mainstays like The Stud in San Francisco 
and Therapy in New York, to name a couple. The 
economic hardships from 2020 to now have left 
all sorts of nightlife establishments (queer or not) 
boarded up and empty. But there might be more 
subliminal reasons for the decline in gay bars 
across the United States.
