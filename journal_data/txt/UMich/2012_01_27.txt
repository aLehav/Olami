Gov. Rick Snyder
to release budget
proposal on Feb. 9
By ANDREW SCHULMAN
Daily Staff Reporter
With Republican Gov. Rick Sny-
der's presentation of the 2013 fis-
cal year budget two weeks away,
University officials say they are
optimistic about a possible uptick
in higher education and revenue-
sharing allocations for next year.
The budget, which Snyder will
present on Feb. 9, will be released
as the state faces its first surplus in
years after a spate of cuts to high-
er education funding, including a
15-percent cut to the state's 15 pub-
lic universities last year.
* Coupled with an improved
economy statewide, the surplus has
give, University officials and state
representatives hope that the Uni-
versity budget could grow for the
2013 fiscal year.
Cynthia Wilbanks, the Univer-
sity's yice president for government
relations, said she is "cautiously
optimistic" about an increase in
higher education funding for next
year. She added that her optimism

stems from the state's economic
rebound and Gov. Snyder's pledge
last year to expand higher educa-
tion funding when the state became
financially capable.
"What we are looking for is
renewed investment, and there"
may be opportunities this year that
we have not seen in many, many
years," Wilbanks said.,"... The Uni-
versity is eager to see new invest-
ments in its public universities."
Wilbanks said she was unsure
of the amount by which the allo-
cations might increase, or if they
will at all. Last year, the Univer-
sity received about $268 million
following the 15-percent funding
cut across all state universities. In
response, the regents voted in June
to raise tuition 4.9 percent for out-
of-state students and 6.7 percent for
in-state students.
This year's budget may intro-
duce formula funding, which relies
on performance metrics to deter-
mine how funds are distributed to
each state university. The metrics
are based on factors like gradua-
tion and freshman-retention rates,
which previously had no impact on
the allocation of funds to the state's
15 public universities.

Speech to be
broadcast at
several campus
buildings
By AARON GUGGENHEIM
Daily Staff Reporter
For the students who
decided to opt out of joining

the crowd of 3,000 who with-
stood bitter cold early yester-
day morning to obtain tickets
to President Barack Obama's
speech at Al Glick Field House
today, alternative viewing
options will be provided.
Due to the high demand
for tickets, the University is
making arrangements for the
speech to be broadcast via web
cast. Viewings of the speech
will also be held at the Michi-

gan Union Ballroom, the Ross
School of Business and the
Duderstadt Center.
Last night, students began
filling the Union at about 7:30
p.m. in hopes of being among
the first in line to receive a
ticket. At 1 a.m., students were
asked to leave the building
before it officially closed to the
public at 2 a.m. The crowd of
people - which was estimated
to be at 1,000 at the time -

relocated to Regents Plaza and
extended around the Cube and
toward the Fleming Adminis-
tration Building.
University Spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald said the University
decided to make the speech
available to everyone through
the webcast in an effort to
accommodate for the mem-
bers of the campus community
unable to receive a ticket.

New Mexico debate over restrictions
on immigrant driver's licenses persists

0

Officials say
current policy a
threat to safety
SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -
Republican Gov. Susana Mar-
tinez suffered a temporary
political setback yesterday in
a bid to stop New Mexico from
granting driver's licenses to ille-
gal immigrants.
A legislative commit-
tee shelved her proposal and
approved a Democrat-backed
alternative that continues to
allow licenses for illegal immi-
grants but with new restric-
tions.
The politically-charged fight
is far from over, however. The
legislation heads to another
panel for consideration and
Martinez stands a strong chance

of success if the issue reaches
the full 70-member House for
a vote. A measure to overturn
New Mexico's license policy for
immigrants passed the House
last year with the support of
eight Democrats and one inde-
pendent.
"I've got all the votes I need
in the House," said Rep. Andy
Nunez, a Hatch independent
sponsoring the governor's pro-
posal.
Nunez conceded it's very
uncertain whether the mea-
sure can clear the Democrat-
controlled Senate, which solidly
rejected it last year.
The House Labor and Human
Resources Committee voted 5-4
on a party-line split for what
Democrats described as a com-
promise proposal. Republicans
opposed it.
The measure allows illegal

immigrants to continue getting
licenses but for only two years
before needing renewal. Cur-
rently, licenses can last four
or eight years. The measure
increases penalties for license
fraud and will cancel licenses
previously issued to foreign
nationals if they renew them
within two years - allowing
the state to determine whether
people remain New Mexico resi-
dents.
House Majority Leader Ken
Martinez, a Grants Democrat,
said the state's license policy
allows illegal immigrants to
"come up from the shadows"
so they can drive to work and
take their children to school
and other places without fear of
arrest for not having a license.
The committee-approved
restrictions will "really hit the
bad guys hard," he said.

Farmers eager
for right to kill
attacking wolves
John Koski is itching to pick
up his rifle after losing dozens
of cows to hungry wolves on his
farm in Michigan's Upper Penin-
sula - and it appears he'll soon
get his chance.
A legal shield that has pro-
tected gray wolves in the west-
ern Great Lakes region for nearly
four decades will disappear today
when the animal leaves the feder-
al endangered species list. With
that milestone, a primal struggle
that was waged in this rugged
backcountry for more than a cen-
tury will resume, although in a
more restrained fashion.
"It's about time," said Koski,
67, one of many ranchers eager to
begin shooting wolves that prey
on livestock. Likewise, hunters
are pushing for the chance to
stalk a foe legendary for its cun-
ning that has long been off-limits.

Mitt and Ann Romney failed
to list investment income from

required of presidential candi-

A Romney spokeswoman said
yesterday the adjustments would
be trivial and would not alter the
overall picture of the Romneys'
finances. The former Massachu-
setts governor has estimated his
wealth at as much as $250 million.,
The Swiss account was held in
Ann Romney's blind trust. The tax
returns show the Romneys made
$1,783 in interest income from

that account in 2010.

Elephant meat
trendy in Thailand
A new taste for eating ele-
phant meat - everything from
trunks to sex organs - has
emerged in Thailand and could
pose a new threat to the survival
of the species.
Wildlife officials told The
Associated Press that they were
alerted to the practice after find-
ing two elephants slaughtered
last month in a national park in
western Thailand.
"The poachers took away the
elephants' sex organs and trunks
... for human consumption,"
Damrong Phidet, director-gen-
eral of Thailand's wildlife agen-
cy, said in a telephone interview.
Some meat was to be consumed
without cooking, like "elephant
' sashimi," he said.
Poachers typically just remove
tusks, which are most commonly
found on Asian male elephants
and fetch thousands of dollars on
the black market. A market for
elephant meat, however, could
lead to killing of the wider ele-
phant population, Damrong said.

BUDGET

questioned formula funding,
but Wilbanks said she would not
necessarily be opposed to the
implementation of performance
metrics.
In November, the University's
Board of Regents sent a letter
to State Budget Director John
Nixon, developer of the for-
mula, stating that they felt the
model might not account for the
University's value to the state
in terms of its more specialized
endeavors, like research.
University President Mary
Sue Coleman echoed this senti-
ment in an interview last month,
saying that the metrics model
would not best serve the Univer-
sity's interests.
"I've never seen a formula
that could be fair," Coleman
said. "I'm very concerned since
the funding level in the state
is the bottom 10 percent in
the nation among states, that
somehow we would do harm to
institutions right now -by say-
ing, 'Ok, suddenly we're going
to have a formula that seems
willy-nilly."'
State Rep. Joan Bauer (D-
East Lansing), vice chair of the
State House of Representatives
Higher Education Appropria-
tions Subcommittee, predicted
only a small percentage of the
state budget will be directed to
the performance-based model,
while the majority of higher
education funding would be
allocated under the traditional
system.

"Some are fine with CTools,"
Kucher said. "But there are
others who are definitely inter-

rience that students get."
Sean Demonner, director

sity about CTools, particularly
regarding its tab sections.

Bauer said that it would not
be fair to fully instate a new per-
formance-based model in the
budget this year since universi-
ties haven't had adequate time to
prepare for the changes.
"To me it wouldn't be fair to
drop this on this current budget
when they haven't had ample
time to say, 'Ok, here are the
things they're going to look at,'
Bauer said. "There's still lots of
moving parts."
State Rep. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann
Arbor) said he thought the per-
formance-based model might
be problematic since it could
preclude schools that do not per-
form well from improving in the
future.
"You want to reward the best
and brightest," Irwin said. "But
how do you come up with a fair
way to do that - how do you
come up with a (method of) per-
formance-based pay forteachers
that doesn't ultimately just pay
the teachers based on the qual-
ity of the students, not based on
the quality of the teaching."
Regardless, Irwin said educa-
tion is the state's most impor-
tant mission and he hopes to see
increased allocations to higher
education in the budget.
"We should be making (it) a
priority," he said. "It's the most
important thing the state does.
It's the biggest determinant to
our economic prosperity long-
term ... there's really no excuse
for the cuts that we've passed
along to college students and
young kids in the last decade."

According to Demonner,
the University has used learn-

CTools for many years, and
is currently in the process of
developing the Sakai Open
Academic Environment - an
advanced platform that will
replace CTools in the future.
"We envision a future aca-

marked by ease of use, reliabil-

with other important services,

LSA senior Mallory Edel said
she isn't satisfied with the cur-

be happy to see upgrades to the

David Canter, executive direc-

Barbra Meek, another co-

as articulating novel thoughts

the complex, it is still in the pro-
cess of developing the. types of
programs it will hold.
"You need new people, but you
also need some new programs
and that's a little bit more com-
plex," Forrest said. "Programs
involve figuring out the interre-
latedness you want between the
various activities, and that takes
time."
He added that the interdisci-
plinary nature of the program
allows for various academic pro-
grams to work collaboratively in
research endeavors.
"It provides a tremendous
opportunity to bring groups from
different disciplines together to
solve large problems," Forrest
said. "If you get different mixes
of people and disciplines, you
find that you're solving different
problems, and if you're solving
different problems, you have the
opportunity to expand the rest
of your research while making a
bigger impact."
Forrest said one of the NCRC's
greatest accomplishments so far
mingincludes a number of cours-
es as well as events focused on
the nature of language in society
such as lectures, films, museum
exhibits and workshops.
"The course offerings enable
students to investigate mul-
tiple facets of language, includ-
ing biological, social, cultural,
anthropological, communicative
and literary," Baptista wrote.
"In short, LSA theme semester
courses offer a unique platform
for interdisciplinary collabora-
tions and exchanges on a single
topic."

Coordinator Jennifer Nguyen
said one of the unique things
about the theme semester is that
it approaches language from a
number of unique angles, includ-
ing humor, education and endan-
germent.

also strives to draw attention to

a ticket, but understands other
students wanted tickets more
than she did.
"I'd love to go. How many
chances do you get to see the
president speak?" she said. " ...
(But) I would have spent the
night if I was a die-hard Obama
supporter."
She said while she wishes

Six people die in
building collapse
in Rio de Janeiro

RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) - A
janitor finishing up the day's
work, an accountant closing the
books for the month, a computer
technician installing software:
each had a reason to stay a little
late at work.
They were among those
trapped when three buildings
suddenly collapsed into a pile
of rubble in downtown Rio de
Janeiro. Rescuers pulled out at
least six bodies, according to
the city morgue, and 16 people
remained missing yesterday as
the smoke from small fires drift-
ed above the wreckage.
Authorities were still inves-
tigating the cause, but officials
speculated that illegal construc-
tion work damaged the struc-
ture of a 20-story building and
caused it to crumble, wrenching
down two other office build-
ings alongside at about 8:30 p.m.
Wednesday.
The janitor was among the
six injured extracted by rescue
crews from the heap of bricks,
metal and glass. The accountant
and the computer technician are
among the missing. Their friends
or relatives took shelter from the
scorching sun in a nearby build-
ing, hoping for news.
Francisco Adir was trying to
get information about a friend,
Flavio Porrozi, 23, who had been
attending a computer course in
the largest of the three build-
ings.

"We think he's alive. At 3 a.m.
he managed to call his girlfriend
and say, 'Hello, love,' before his
phone went dead," Adir said.
"The rescuers haven't given us
any information, but the family
is hanging all their hopes on that
phone call."
Five of the six bodies pulled
out have been identified in the
city morgue, and Porrozi is not
among them.
As the hours ticked by, rela-
tives of the missing tried to keep
despair at bay.
"We last heard from him at 8
p.m. when he called his wife to
say he wouldn't be much longer,"
said Luis Cesar Vasconcelos,
whose brother, computer techni-
cian Luis Leandro Vasconcelos,
remained trapped in the debris.
"Since then, there's been no sign
of him, but the family is hopeful
to the end."
The state's governor, Sergio
Cabral, issued a statement saying
the government was doing all it
could to support the families of
the victims.
"We're still living a moment
of shock," he said. "There is still
hope of finding survivors, and in
a last instance, of rescuing bod-
ies."
One of those pulled out alive
was Marcelo Moreira, a jani-
tor in one of the buildings that
crumbled near Rio's historic
Teatro Municipal and the Fine
Arts Museum.

Salling better care
State House shouldn't delay insurance exchange
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act has the
potential to bring necessary improvements to Michi-
gan's health care system. But gridlock in the state
House of Representatives threatens to hold up implementa-
tion of the bill, which will bring improved medical coverage
to .Michigan residents. House Republicans are stalling leg-
islation pushed by Republican Gov. Rick Snyder that would
create a Michigan health insurance exchange as mandated by
federal law. The GOP majority should stop dragging its feet
on passing this beneficial law. Failure to pass this legislation
would force Michigan to adopt a federally managed exchange
program instead of a system unique to Michigan's needs.

It's all about you(tube)

Atypical day at the florist that
my family owns involves
some "idiot teenager" - or
so my aunts
say - order-
ing a ridiculous
floral arrange-
ment online
because "your
generation 3
doesn't have
enough. social .ADRIENNE
skills to pick ROBERTS
up the phone".
We usually then
have to call up that certain idiot
anyway to let them know what they
chose were out of season, we can't
deliver to their area or the vase they
chose only holds about $5 worth of
flowers.
I cringe when I hear this, and
struggle to think of some - usu-
ally inarticulate - reason why it's
simply not true that my generation
has poor social skills, that it's just
all a misunderstanding. But this
small misinterpretation of genera-
tional differences has turned into a
major catastrophe. Being an active
member of this so-called "YouTube
generation" comes with a price.
My generation has been called
self-promotional, computer nerds,
technology-dependent and simply
not self-aware. The name calling
reveals a deep mistrust between my
generation and those previous.
The Stop Online Piracy Act and
Protect IP Act showed the YouTube
generation just how much igno-
rance exists surrounding the tech-
nologies that define our era.-The
second part of the sentence seems
redundant. Watching congressmen
call people who know how to use
the Internet "nerds" in condescend-

ing tones is slightly unnerving.
SOPA is not the only expose of
the animosity that exists between
generations. On Jan. 14, Saturday
Night Live aired a mock talk show
segment called "You Can Do Any-
thing." It was loaded with sarcasm
and,. unfortunately, some truth.
The hosts say lines such as, "You're
so self-promotional and everyone
enjoys that" and "the incredibly
high self-esteem of the YouTube
generation." This parody put into
words what many are thinking:
Members of the YouTube genera-
tion believes they can do anything
they want from the comfort of a
computer screen.
The fact is that my generation
and previous generations need to
work on understanding and accept-
ing the way different generations
live and function in society if we
hope for any social or political
progress. The YouTube generation
- the generation that represents
the future. workforce and lead-
ers - is constantly judged on how
its actions will change the present
and future. It can't look productive
to previous generations as my gen-
eration sits at a job, or in a.lecture,
switching between Facebook and
Twitter. There is a perception that
people in the YouTube generation
have no social skills because their
heads are too frequently buried in
various mediums of technology.
There is a flip side to these accu-
sations. Many times, using social
networking sites and still getting
work done is possible. Technol-
ogy has become seamless, mean-
ing that while someone else's day
might end at five, people now do
homework and write papers on lap-
tops and smart phones way past the

standard workday.
It's essential for the progress of
our society to agree to disagree.
It's quite possible that a person
free of technology can accomplish
the same as a person engrossed in
new technology. People aren't get-
ting dumber; the way we think is
simply changing. Social skills have
not died with older generations.
They have, however, been modified
to fit into today's society. Change is
scary for older generations because
what they know and have grown up
with is slowly becoming obsolete.
Younger generations must realize
that social skills and the ability to
accomplish things without technol-
ogy are still essential.
The world has

changed in style,
not content.
The world has changed less in
content and more in style. The
need for communication and the
desire to do one's best work have
not changed. A cross-generational
understanding of this concept has
the power to unite people of all
ages, leading to the accomplish-
ment of beneficial change and much
progress in this world.
And please, just pick up the
phone to order flowers. My aunts
will thank you.

In March 2010, President Barack Obama
fulfilled a key campaign promise by signing
major health care reforms into law. Among
other initiatives, the reform package calls for
each state to create a unique health insur-
ance exchange, offering a private market-
place with a variety of plans for consumers
to choose from. In Michigan, approximately
500,000 residents would use the exchange to
buy insurance. The state must approve leg-
islation to create an exchange marketplace.
There's no reason for House Republicans
to continue delaying. Health care interest
groups within the state, including Michi-
gan Consumers for Health care and AARP
of Michigan, are pushing for immediate
approval of the plan.
Both Snyder and state Senate Republicans
support the measure, but House Republicans
are delayingthe bill, hoping the U.S. Supreme
Court will rule the health care act unconsti-
tutional. Members of the House should follow
their counterparts in the Senate and approve
the bill. A decision from the Supreme Court,
even if it were to limit parts of PPACA, may
not be handed down until the summer. State
leadership in Lansing can't put off passing the
bill for that long. A local insurance exchange is
vital for Michigan now, not later.

Continued delays put the state at risk of
losing the opportunity to develop its own dis-
tinctive healthcare exchange. If legislation is
stalled until after Jan. 1, 2013, the state will
lose control of nearly $10 million in federal
funding. Failing to meet the deadline is unac-
ceptable for the people of Michigan and state
insurance providers.
Passing on the option for an exchange set
up by Michigan legislators will limit choices
for consumers because local providers could
likely be left out in favor of larger national
firms - meaningless competitive and specif-
ic insurance options for Michigan consum-
ers. In order to ensure that Michiganders
receive the best coverage, the exchange
should be managed on the state level.
With the passage of the Patient Protection
and Affordable Care Act, the Obama Admin-
istration took a major step towards ensur-
ing access to health care for all Americans.
Millions of uninsured Americans will now
receive competitive coverage and treatment.
Republicans in the state House are putting
politics before their constitutents. They
should abandon attempts to postpone this
important legislation and move forward with
the creation of a Michigan health insurance
exchange.

JACOB LIGHT I V
Worth the wait

I don't consider myself an outdoorsy per-
son. As a matter of fact, I try to avoid being
outside as much as possible - especially over-
night. I can count the number of times that I've
camped out on one hand, and each of those
instances has been for a midnight Harry Pot-
ter release. While I try to avoid camping at all
costs, I'll have to add another outdoor experi-
ence to the tally: Waiting outside the Michigan
Union to get my hands on a ticket to President
Barack Obama's speech this morning.
Words cannot describe how exciting it is to
know that the president of the United States is
going to be on our campus. Today, more than
ever, it's important that our student body pays
close attention to what Obama has to say. Con-
servative or liberal, Democrat or Republican,
Obama's address presents our student body
with an incredible opportunity to hear what
he is planning to do for us, as students and as
Michigan residents.
Obama's speech at the University is not sim-
ply an opportunity to use political rhetoric to
feign interest in our state's welfare. The presi-
dent has consistently shown a vested interest
in the state of Michigan throughout his time
in office. Just months into his presidency, he
invested in Michigan's automobile industry,
which saved thousands of jobs and prevented
two of the largest employers, General Motors
and Chrysler, in our state from shutting down.
During his State of the Union address on
Tuesday he highlighted Michigan's economic
comeback as an example of American resil-
ience and successful government interven-
tions. Again and again, President Obama has
shown his firm commitment to the success of
our state.
As University students, we should also pay
close attention to Obama's vision for higher
education. With skyrocketing tuition costs,
college is becoming increasingly out of reach
for many Americans. Many at the University
face the prospect of graduating with insur-
mountable student debt. This frightening

future is one that both President and First
Lady Michelle Obama have experienced them-
selves - they spent a decade repaying their
own student loans. In his State of the Union
address, he discussed rising tuition costs and
crippling student loans, and introduced plans
to increase work-study opportunities and urge
states to make higher education a priority. For
a state that cut higher education appropriations
by 15 percent last year, Obama's call to action
couldn't come at a better time.
In November, we will have the opportunity
to choose the person who will lead our country
for the next four years. When listening to what
candidates for the presidency have to say, ask
yourself, "What will he or she do for students.
For Michigan?"
As a state, we cannot risk electing a candi-
date like Mitt Romney, a man with Michigan
roots who argued that the automakers should
be allowed to "go bankrupt." As students, we
cannot afford to elect a candidate like Newt
Gingrich, who blames education debt on stu-
dents' own irresponsibility. We must take great
care to elect the person who supports our state
and supports our education. Obama is thatcan-
didate.
I am willing to forego my aversion to camp-
ing outdoors for only a few people. For a while,
only Harry Potter could get me to get out a
sleeping bag and camp outside of a bookstore or
movietheater. Giventhe uncertaintyfacingour
country's future, however, I think I can make
an exception for Obama.
As University students, we should be hon-
ored that Obama is coming to address the
University. His visit shows that he cares about
Michigan and about students. It is up to us to
give him our attention and support as we move
into the most important election of our genera-
tion.

your obvious cues, he pushes on

"Without your help, we can't
make a difference! Show us how
much you care about the environ-
ment and donate now!" he instructs.
How exactly will your donation
be used? Are there other ways in
which you, a not-so-financially-
endowed college student, can con-
tribute to the cause? And most
importantly, why is he shouting so
loud? Never mind those details. He
just wants you to feel guilty, really
guilty, until you fork over the cash.
When pitching views about the
environment and public health,
activists, marketers and others
often use dramatic guilt and fear
tactics to catch their audience's
attention. Though this can be
effective in attracting people to
the cause, it can also come off as
pushy and irritating - and unlike-
ly to accomplish much in the long
run.
Fear and guilt-induced moti-
vations to support or reject envi-
ronmental initiatives are fleeting.
These tactics are no substitution
for solid facts, thorough research
and sincere passion in their poten-
tial to change long-term viewpoints
and motivate others to action. It's
time to look past such desperate,
emotional pleas.
Arnold Schwarzenegger, the for-

in Washington to meet with the
head of the Environmental Protec-
tion Agency, Schwarzenegger com-
mented on California's strong role
in the forefront of modern environ-
mental progress, saying, "Success-
ful movements are built on passion;
they aren't built on guilt."
Schwarzenegger also compared
environmentalism to bodybuild-
ing, which he said was considered
"a marginal sport for weirdos" in
the past. But as with bodybuild-
ing, Schwarzenegger thinks that
the role of environmental issues is
going to take a major shift." (Body-
building) became mainstream, it
became sexy, attractive - and this
is exactly what has to happen with
the environmental movement," he
said.
Maybe environmental issues
don't quite have the same poten-
tial for the literal attractiveness of
bodybuilding, but they should be
reported in a way that is interesting
and accessible to the public - with-
out making those listening feel like
they're doing absolutely everything
wrong. An interaction on that note
is just plain draining.
A Nov. 25 article on Canada.
com echoes the importance of this
sentiment. It uses terms like "eco-
anxiety" to describe environmental
guilt trips and states, "If you carry
the weight of 'green guilt,' consider
this column your permission to get
over it. You can't take care of any-
one if you can't take care of your-
self," Canada.com reported.
The article also mentions a
recently published book titled, "Spit
That Out! The Overly Informed
Parent's Guide to Raising Children
in the Age of Environmental Guilt."
The book was written to help moth-
ers recover from spinning on the
hamster wheel of healthy living
advice and nearing a "green mom

non-renewable resource depletion,
loss of global biodiversity and cli-
mate change, to mention a few -
fear and guilt-induced decisions to
make lifestyle changes in the name
of sustainability aren't the answer
to effective and long-term action.
Though I have the utmost respect
for all who make major, immedi-
ate lifestyle changes in the name of
sustainability, that process can be
overwhelming and isn't practical
for everyone.
Nobody likes a
cranky preachy
enviromentalist

I'll admit that I've taken on the
persona of the unrelenting environ-
mentalist in the past. Not always on
purpose, but sometimes yes. It can
be a force for good, but, when alone,
it is less likely to have positive con-
sequences than when coupled with
facts, logic and pragmatism.
Ecology is 'all about trade-offs.
Though some organisms alter their
ecosystems more drastically than
others, all species must do so in
order to survive. No matter how
much we try to become "one with
the earth," we will never literally
be capable of such a feat.
So, chill outa little bit. Don't ago-
nize over drinking from one paper
cup or give your mother the silent
treatment for forgetting cloth gro-
cery bags. You're doing your best -
and your best will never be perfect.

he Ark's annual
k Festival features
n array of artists
By KATIE STEEN
DailyArts Writer

Throaty utterances ofheart-felt
lyrics. An abundance of banjos.
Perhaps, peasant skirts. But also,
"fire-breathing circus freaks"
who use kitchen utensils as
instruments. These are just a few
things attendees of the Ann Arbor
Folk Festival can expect.
This year's Folk Festival fea-
tures an impressive group of
headliners includingRyanAdams,
DeVotchKa, Emmylou Harris,
Nanci Griffith and Glen Campbell,
but also intermingles emerging
talents Elephant Revival, David
Wax Museum and Caravan of
Thieves (the self-titled circus
freaks). While The Ark as -the -
organization that runs Folk Fes-
tival, the event's expected atten-
dance of six to seven thousand
folk fans would be an amount sim-
ply impossible to jam into the cozy
setting of The Ark itself. Instead,
these musicians will share the
stage at the Hill Auditorium
tonight and tomorrow in an event
that has been played since 1977.
The Ark's Marketing Director,
Barb Chaffer-Authier elaborated
on the history of the Folk Festi-
val, emphasizing its importance
in maintaining The Ark's non-
profit mission. The event was
created with the goal of raising
money for the organization after
funding from the First Presby-
terian Church began to dwindle,
and started as a few friends and
performers of The Ark gather-
ing at the Power Center to make
music and money. While the Ark
was originally founded as a cof-
feehouse where youth of the 'U0s
could discuss Vietnam and Wood-
stock, it gradually began to focus
more on the music. By 1969, it was
the hub of Ann Arbor's folk music
scene, and while money was no
longer an issue, The Ark decided
to stay non-profit.
"We're really the longest-sur-
viving non-profit music venue of
our kind in the nation," Chaffer-
Authier said. "There was a time
where there were a lot of non-
profit music venues, but there
aren't a lot of those left."
However, the Ark isn't exactly
begging for change. The Folk Fes-
tival, as per usual, is sold out this
year. Part of what attracts such
large crowds to the two-night
concert is the diverse lineup.
While there are Folk Festival
devotees who attend every year,
there is also a substantial num-
ber of attendees drawn by a single
headliner.
"It's a great opportunity for
people to come to the festival to
see someone like Ryan Adams, in
which case they know the music
.and that's what brings them in,"
Chaffer-Authier said. "But they
might leave the festival knowing
someone new who might be their
future favorite."
To accommodate for such musi-
cal discoveries, The Ark invites
the non-headlining Folk Festival
performers to play a full show
in the spring. Chaffer-Authier
gave a particularly serendipitous
example of a Folk Festival artist
who achieved a more than solid

fan base in just two nights. Chi-
cago native Joe Pug had never
performed in Ann Arbor and
wasn't even on the Folk Festival
lineup, and when he performed as
a guest appearance, he only played
one song each night. But when he
returned to the Ark in the spring,
he sold out.
"I like when young perform-
ers get a boost," Chaffer-Authier
added. "We book headliners first
and then the headliners influence
who we pick to round out the bill
each year. We try to have a bal-
ance of different styles."
Sometimes, creating this
diversity means booking loud-
er, more energetic artists, like
2002's Melissa Ferrick. Some-
times it means booking a drum-
mer who wears nothing but a
loin cloth during performance,
as it was for 2007's Kiyoshi
Nagata Ensemble.
"A lot of our bands can be a
surprise to audience me'mbers.
depending on what they think of
when they think of folk music,"
Chaffer-Authier said. "No matter
what folk means to you, we'll have
it at the Folk Festival. There's a
different definition for everyone."
one band in particular, Ele-
phant Revival, encompasses a
multiplicity of genres in their
music. Multi-instrumentalist and
singer Dan Rodriguez explained
the band's label of "transcenden-
tal folke" was eoed -unon +he

nalist.
"From my understanding, folk
music is music created by the
people for the people," Rodri-
guez said. "You can't really define
music through labels. They're a
way to conceptualize or compart-
mentalize. But we are definitely
folk music."
But part of what distinguishes
Elephant Revival from the stereo-
typical folk band image of beard-
ed guitarists with a washboard
is its wide range of influences
and the malleability of its sound..
Rodriguez described the music of
Elephant Revival as a spectrum,
able to channel a variety of styles
- old-time, avant-garde jazz, pop
rock.
"We all have such different
influences," Rodriguez said, "And
it all comes together and creates
this tapestry. That's why we can
play for all audiences. It's all over
the map, in a good way. A broad
spectrum."
Given the band's eclectic
nature, Elephant Revival seems
like an obvious choice for the fes-
tival. Though Rodriguez was a bit
surprised at the invitation to per-
form, he expressed a contagious
enthusiasm.
"The lineup looks awesome so
we're excited to be on the same
stage as so many amazing, tal-
ented artists. We're grateful to
have this opportunity to play for
the folks of Michigan," Rodriguez

At first glance, "House of Lies"

the zeitgeist. In the wake of the

lives of the 1
percent was all o s
but inevitable. Pilot
But "House of
Lies" isn't really Sundays at 10 p.m.
that show - it's Showtime
about a wacky
team of management consultants
having zany adventures at a dif-
ferent struggling megacorpora-
tion everyweek - and this kind of
procedural storytelling isn't real-
ly conducive to making a socio-
economic point.
Not only that, but the show's
topicality is completely under-
minedbyitstone-deafness. Show-
time often disguises its comedies
with the form and tone of dramas,
as was the case with "Weeds" and
"The Big C." As satire, "House of
Lies" may have been better served
by the same treatment. Played
straight, it's just lifestyle porn in
the style of "Entourage" married
haphazardly to workplace com-
edy and then stapled to antihero
drama.
Just like the characters it por-
trays, "House of Lies" is way too
slick and self-satisfied. You could
think of it as a clever metatextual
technique intended to echo the
mocking characterization of ass-
holes with MBAs. But really, it's
just a show about assholes with
MBAs. A strip club scene is por-
trayed with completely unironic
glamour and thus speaks to the
show's lack of self-awareness.
The show's most irritating
conceit is borrowed from, of all
things, "Saved by the Bell": Don
Cheadle ("Hotel Rwanda") stops
time occasionallyto explain man-
agement consulting terms to the
audience. This is an unbelievably
clumsy way to convey informa-
tion. And when Cheadle explains
terms with obvious definitions,
it's just a meaningless waste of
the viewer's time and patience.

Two years ago at the State
Theater, I was convinced my
death was imminent. Huddled
in my cushioned seat, I watched
the final scene of "Paranormal
Activity" through crisscrossed
fingers (a special fear-reducing
technique I've developed). In the
packed rows of the theater, others
wailed and assumed similar posi-
tions: death-gripping the hands
of significant others (as if your
boyfriend could save you from
the demon) becoming suddenly
engrossed by the bucket of pop-
corn in their laps or - recogniz-
ing that escape was impossible
- simply staring at the screen,
wide-eyed.
This was not the isolated fear
oflyingin bed alone as a child, but
the shared terror that only mov-
ies and ghost-stories can produce.
My roommate Brian, one of those
special individuals immune to
paralyzing fear, was wrestling my
hands off of my face. "Watch it,
watch it, watch it!" he whispered
embarrassingly loudly.
My heart stopped as the ulti-
mate scene passed. I recall willing
it to beat again (I still had so much
to do and see!), as the man behind
us issued a high-school-girl-like
scream and Brian grinned widely.

Another rivalry game, and

The game Center Arena

of the most CBS
hyped match-
ups between
the two teams in years, as the
rivals haven't played against
each other as ranked teams
since 1992.
"We're fortunate this week,"
said freshman point guard Trey
Burke. "We have about three or
four days to prepare for them
and watch film on them, some-
thing we really haven't had since
the beginning of the year."
It's been nine years since
Michigan (6-2, 16-5) took down
the Buckeyes on the road, but
this year's Wolverines may be
the best candidates in a decade
to knock off their rival.
At 6-2, the Wolverines are off.
to their best conference start in
six years. Burke, who is averag-
ing 14 points and five assists per
game, has added & new dynamic
to Michigan coach John Beilein's
offense, making it quicker, crisp-
er and more explosive.
The game will mark Burke's
return to his native Columbus,
where he became close friends
with Buckeye star forward,
Jared Sullinger.

Ohio State centerJared Sullinger is averaging 17 points and nine rebounds per game this season for the Buckeyes.

Ohio State, widely considered
the runaway favorite to win the
Big Ten at the start of the sea-
son, lived up to its billing dur-
ing its non-conference slate. The
Buckeyes' only blemish during
pre-Big Ten play came on the
road against No. 5 Kansas, a
game which Sullinger sat out
with a back injury..
But as soon as the Buckeyes
entered conference play, it was
unable to shed the plague that
has infected the rest of the
conference - road losses. Ohio
State fell to Indiana on New
Year's Eve and was upset 10 days
later at Illinois behind a stel-
lar 43-point performance from
Fighting Illini guard Brandon
Paul. The two losses leave the
Buckeyes in a three-way tie for
first place with the Wolverines
and No. 10 Michigan State.
Ohio State is led by Sull-
inger, who averages 17 points
and nine rebounds a game,

numbers almost identical to his
stellar freshman year. Forward
Deshaun Thomas has broken
out this season, nearly doubling
his scoring average from last
season.
But the key matchup on Sun-
day could be at point guard
between Burke and Ohio State's
Aaron Craft. Satisfied with
recruiting Craft two years ago,
Ohio State coach Thad Matta
showed little interest in Burke
coming out of high school,
despite the Buckeyes being his
top choice.
"He never really forced the
issue to recruit me or offer me
a scholarship," Burke said. "I
think it was more of, he knew
who he wanted at the point
guard position. He was just
recruiting other players. I kind
of knew that he really wasn't
interested in me, or the coach-
ing staff really wasn't interested
in me as much as I wanted as I

wanted them to be.
"Once I got here to Michigan,
I saw that this was the best deci-
sion for me and the best place for
me to be."
For that, Michigan can credit
Craft and Matta for its fast start.
However, the last time Michi-
gan started this well, it didn't
turn out so hot. The 2005-06
team that started out 6-2 was
ranked 21st going into its ninth
conference game. But that next
contest was a blowout loss on the
road at Iowa and the Wolverines
went on to lose seven of their last
nine regular-season games.
Michigan hopes to avoid a
similar fate this year as it nears
the back half of its conference
schedule.
"It's real important," Burke
said. "We're tied at first with
Ohio State. Pulling out a win in
Columbus will probably give us
a chance of being one of the top
teams in the Big Ten."

Wolverines falter
in paint at Crisler

Junior guard Nya Jordan collected a double-double against Penn State on Thursday, scoring 10 points and grabbing 12 rebounds in the Wolverines blowout loss.

MICHAEL LAURILA
Daily Sports Writer
It's the same story, just a dif-
ferent chapter.
The Michigan women's bas-
ketball team lost to No. 18 Penn
State on Thursday at the Crisler
Center, their second loss to the
Nittany Lions in as many weeks.
Two weeks ago, when the
teams met at State College, the
Nittany Lions used their ath-
leticism and speed to score 24
points in transition, running the
Wolverines out of the gym in a
78-63 victory.
Thursday, Michigan was able
to contain a speedy Penn State
team, but was unable to stop
the Nittany Lions'. impressive
inside-outside strategy. Junior
center Nikki Greene, standing
at 6-foot-4, dominated the paint
the entire contest.
Greene's ability to establish
herself down low allowed the
Penn State guard trio of Zhaque
Gray, Maggie Lucas and Alex
Bentley to get open looks all
night.
"Nikki Green was pretty dom-
inant in the first half, and any
time you can have a post player
that has that kind of presence
inside, I think it opens things
up for our shooters," said Penn
State coach Coquese Washing-
ton. "Usually we're a team that
if we get great shots, we make a
pretty good percentage of them."
The Nittany Lions took advan-,
tage of those opportunities in
the first half to shoot 49 percent
from the field - with 22 points
coming from Lucas and Bentley.
Because the Wolverines were
forced to pay more attention to
Green than they anticipated, the
guards were freed up to score.
Michigan, which started out
playing a help-oriented defense,
switched to a zone for a majority
of the game to stop Greene.
But when the ball went to
Greene and the Wolverines
collapsed on her, she was able
to kick it back out to her open
guards.
Junior forward Sam Arnold
attributes the open looks to
Michigan testing different

defensive strategies.
"Since we were switching up
our defense, so much, you're try-
ing something new every time
down the court," Arnold said.
"You just need to know where
you're. at and find the people
near you."
Arnold, who comes off the
bench for junior forward Rachel
Sheffer, came into the game
because she was better able to
compensate for Greene's height
and strength. Though she didn't
fare much better than Sheffer on
defense, she was able to get some
tough points in the paint offen-
sively.
"(Greene) is a big girl and we
were outsized a little bit,"Arnold
said. "I also think it comes down
to knowing the other people on
the floor and we needed help to
be there."
The only problem was that
even when the help came, it
was ineffective because Greene
dished to the perimeter.
Greene, who averages 8.2
rebounds per game, finished
with 11 - four offensive and
seven defensive. Though Greene
isn't even one of the top-two
best offensive weapons for Penn
State, she was crucial in Thurs-
day's victory.
Neither coach said they had
made big changes following the
teams' first meeting two weeks
earlier.
Both Borseth and Washing-
-ton knew what their opponent's
game plan was. Penn State did
something entirely different
though - attacking the paint.
The key similarity was that the
Wolverines happened to come
out on the short end of the stick
yet again.
"Their best part of their game
is transition," Borseth said.
"They're really good.
"When they get you in transi-
tion, all of a sudden you're try-
ing to stop Bentley, who's just a
bulls-eye onthepull up, and then
you try to rush up with (Lucas),
and then you have to block out
(Greene), and one thing leads to
another, it snowballs, and (the
lead) just gets bigger and big-
ger."

COLLEEN THOMAS
Daily Sports Writer
If the Michigan women's
basketball team had trouble
with Penn State two weeks ago,
it wasn't
any better PENN STATE 77
Thursday MICHIGAN 561
night.
The Wolverines (5-3 Big Ten,
16-5 overall) shot uncharacter-
istically poorly in the first half,
digging themselves into a deficit
they couldn't overcome. It didn't
help that the 18th-ranked Lady
Lions (6-2, 16-4) shot 56 percent
on the night.
Michigan tallied a season-
low 19 points in the first half on
24-percent shooting. None of the
starters found rhythm early, and
a 13-0 run by Penn State in the
first half seemed to seal the deal.
The Lady Lions went on to win,
77-56.
"They're a good team," said
junior forward Sam Arnold.

"They were getting great shots
as well.
"We were trying to switch up
our defense and throw different
things at them based on who's in
our lineup and cater to the play-
ers out on the court."
Unfortunately for the Wol-
verines, no matter what defense
they threw at it, Penn State was
going to make its shots.
The Lady Lions were yet
again fueled by sophomore Mag-
gie Lucas, who led all scorers
with 23 points.
Juniors Alex Bentley and
Nikki Greene also put up double
figures, scoring 18 and 13 points,
respectively.
The trio was unstoppable,
combining for 23-for-33 shoot-
ing.
But it didn't work out as well
for the Wolverines, who made
only eight shots in the first half
and weren't able to improve
much in the second half. The
Wolverines shot 34 percent

overall and 15 percent from
behind the arc. Arnold led the
Wolverines with 12 points,.and
junior guard Nya Jordan and
senior guard Courtney Boylan
each had 10 points.
Though it was an off night for
Michigan, the team believes it
was getting the right looks.
"We were getting a lot of open
looks, and it was just a mat-
ter of knocking them down,"
Arnold said. "They were making
us move a lot faster and we just
needed to slow down and take a
good shot."
Added Jordan: "I think the
game started off fast, so a lot of
us were getting good shots. We
were shooting so fast because
their defense was really fast-
paced. We needed to take more.
time and focus on the shot."
But the Wolverines couldn't
execute that in Thursday's game.
Every missed shot turned
into a defensive rebound and
an opportunity for Penn State

to extend its lead. The lead was
stretched to 31 at one point, and
it didn't help that Michigan went
one-and-done almost every trip
down the court.
Though the Wolverines had
an off night, Borseth won't
detract from Penn State's stellar
play.
"They are by and far the most
talented team in our confer-
ence," Borseth said. "They're the
team in our conference that can
go and put a dent in the NCAA
tournament because they have
all the pieces in the puzzle.
(They're) big, fast, strong, ath-
letic, and (have the) shooters
and skills. They're a really good
team."
NOTE: Senior guard Car-
men Reynolds tied the program
record for career 3-pointers
tonight when she hit the shot
early in the second half. She now
sits atop the list with Alayne
Ingram ('99-'02) with 182 career
3-pointers.

LUKE PASCH
Daily Sports Editor
Ohio State men's basketball
coach Thad Matta has proven
once again that he is one of the
nation's top recruiters.
A season after three of his five
starters graduated - Dallas Lau-
derdale, Jon Diebler and David
Lighty - his fourth-ranked Buck-
eyes still have the firepower to
hang with the country's perennial
elite.
Featuring a dominant front-
court led by returning NCAA
Freshman of the Year Jared
Sullinger and a backcourt led by
the nimble Aaron Craft, Matta's
Buckeye squad is still quite formi-
dable.
When No. 20 Michigan (6-2
Big Ten, 16-5 overall) travels to
Columbus on Sunday to take on
Ohio State (6-2, 18-3), the two
teams will be tied atop the Big Ten
standings.
And taking control of first place
won't be easy for the Wolverines,
as the Buckeyes haven't lost at
home in 38 straight contests.
At Big Ten Media Day in Octo-
ber, Matta and Craft sat down
with the Daily to discuss the
upcoming season.
The Michigan Daily: Is it dif-
ficult to replace guys like Lighty,
Diebler and Lauderdale?
Aaron Craft: It is definitely dif-
ferent. There were a few times in
the summer, when we went in the
locker room, went in the weight
room, and those three guys
weren't there. Not just from lead-
ership standpoint, but their per-
sonalities are gone. It's definitely
different.
(The team has) grown into
it now I think, -and it's a cool
experience. The freshmen have
been really understanding. Even
though Jared and I and (forward

Senior defenseman Greg
Pateryn has been working hard
this season to bring certain tro-
phies back to Yost Ice Arena.
December saw 'the return of
the Great Lakes Invitational's
MacInnes trophy to its familiar
perch on a table outside of Michi-
gan coach Red Berenson's office.
A month later, it was joined by a
40-pound figure of a hockey play-
er from the Wolverines' victory at
the Frozen-Diamond Faceoff.
But on Thursday, Pateryn
brought a different trophy out of
hibernation.
A Michigan hockey helmet
set on a wooden platform left its
usual home on top of a refrigera-
tor in Yost and saw ice for the first
time in a couple years.
This week saw the Michigan
hockey team pitted against each
other as White versus Blue in a
weeklong battle of three-on-three
games that culminated in a skills
competition.
This year, the Blue team -
under the direction of Pateryn -
won the contest and brought the
unnamed trophy out of the case.
"(The trophy) started years
ago," Berenson said. "We used to
have a time when we had a week
off. We decided to have a three-
on-three trophy. It's been around
for a long time."
Though the competition isn't
a staple event for the Wolverines,
they're currently on a bye week,
Berenson thought a friendly chal-
lenge would give the team a little
fun while still staying focused on
upcoming games.
. Michigan started playing its
three-on-three games on Tues-
day, with the points adding onto
each other as the days progressed.
Though the bulk of the week's
practice focused on improving
some of the Wolverines' lacklus-
ter units - notably the power play
- the scrimmages allowed for a


little bit of experimentation on
Berenson's end. Berenson specifi-
cally divided the teams by match-
ing players who don't normally
skate together.
"You'll see us do three-on-
threes early in the week some-
times, especially for players that
don't silay a lot," Berenson said.
"They get a chance to get in a good
competitive situation."
The skills-based portion of the
competition saw the lighter side
of the Wolverines' practice, which
started off with a radar gun mea-
suring the team's hardest shooter.
"Two years ago one of the base-
ball kids brought a handheld gun
out there," Pateryn said. "I got a
96 (mph)."
How much of an improve-
ment did Pateryn see Thursday?
Enough to win him the title of
Michigan's strongest shooter.
"Today, I finally got the 100."
Other skill-based drills includ-
ed breakaway simulations, accu-
racy tests and agility relays.
Berenson tried to highlight each

player in areas where he thought
they'd best excel.
Though the Blue team ulti-
mately walked away from the
week victorious - freshman
forward Alex Guptill marked
the occasion by mimicking a cel-
ebrational photo shoot with the
trophy - the contest was closely
contested.
Though the White team led in
the three-on-three, its Blue coun-
terpart snuck ahead to seize the
win with victories in the skills
categories.
In fact, Berenson compared the
end result to a situation the Wol-
verines have become quite famil-
iar with this season.
"It's like a shootout," he said.
"The one team might have been
the better team, but the other
team wins in the shootout."
NOTE: Senior forward David
Wohlberg collided with a team-
mate at the beginning of practice
on Thursday. He wore a sling on
his left arm, as a precaution for an
upper-body injury.
