Research indicates 

red meat, fish 
impacts time of 
menstruation

By ALEXA ST. JOHN

Daily Staff Reporter

Though a young girl might 

not expect it at the time, her 
prepubescent dietary habits can 
have major effects on when she 
hits puberty.

According to University of 

Michigan research released last 
week, girls who eat red meat 
more often start menstruation 
about five months earlier than 
girls of the same age who 
consume less red meat.

The study also showed that 

eating fatty fish more often, 
however, has the opposite effect 
and may delay a girl’s menarche, 
or first period, by a few months.

“Animal 
protein 
is 

important 
for 
child 
growth 

and 
development,” 
wrote 

senior study author Eduardo 

Villamor, 
professor 
of 

environmental health sciences 
and epidemiology, in an e-mail 
interview. 
“However, 
it 
is 

possible that some sources of 
animal protein may be healthier 
than others.”

The study, which focused on 

the diets of 456 pre-pubescent 
girls in Bogota, Colombia, was led 
by Public Health student Erica 
Jansen. The girls participated 
in a six-year longitudinal study 
as part of the Bogota School 
Children Cohort. Jansen wrote 
in an e-mail interview she and 
Villamor focused on this region 
of the world due to its unique 
dietary factors.

“Colombia 
is 
currently 

undergoing 
a 
nutrition 

transition, where consumption 
of red meat may be increasing,” 
Jansen wrote.

The researchers, after asking 

when the girls had their first 
period, found that those who 
reported consuming meat two 
or more times a day began their 
periods, on average, at the age 
of 12 years and three months.

Lecturer draws 

from philosophical, 

logic-based 
perspectives

By JENNIFER MEER

Daily Staff Reporter

Scott Klusendorf, founder and 

president of the Life Training 
Institute, spoke in defense of 

pro-life 
beliefs 
and 
activism 

Wednesday evening at an event 
organized by Students for Life.

Established in 2004, the Life 

Training Institute is a pro-life 
organization 
that 
advocates 

against 
the 
legalization 
of 

abortion and trains anti-abortion 
activists.

Klusendorf 
gave 
what 
he 

defined 
as 
a 
scientific 
and 

philosophical argument against 
abortion, emphasizing that it was 
not reliant on religion. As part 

of his argument, he addressed 
five specific questions regarding 
the nature of moral reasoning, 
the unborn, the definition of 
abortion, the question of what 
makes humans valuable and two 
opposition approaches that he 
then countered.

To start, he stressed what 

he called his syllogism against 
abortion.

“Premise one: it is wrong to 

intentionally kill an innocent 
human being,” he said. “Premise 

two: 
abortion 
intentionally 

kills an innocent human being. 
Conclusion: therefore, abortion is 
wrong.”

Students for Life Vice President 

Rachel Crawford, an LSA junior, 
said she thinks it is important 
for 
University 
of 
Michigan 

students to be open to the pro-life 
discussion. 

“I think it’s important for 

any academic space to be able to 
allow speakers from unpopular

Governing body 
passes multiple 
resolutions on 

student well-being

By RHEA CHEETI

For the Daily

At 
their 
Wednesday 

meeting, representatives of 
the LSA Student Government 
passed several resolutions 
focusing 
on 
the 
mental 

well-being and inclusivity 
of University of Michigan 
students.

The 
first 
resolution, 

sponsored 
by 
LSA 

sophomores 
Nicholas 

Fadanelli 
and 
Nicholas 

Meier, aimed to enact the 
first 
University 
Mental 

Health 
Day. 
According 

to 
the 
resolution, 
UM 

mental 
health 
resources 

such 
as 
Counseling 
and 

Psychological Services have 
experienced a 20 percent 
increase in demand, and the 
University’s student body 

experiences 
higher 
levels 

of depression and anxiety 
than the national average. To 
combat this, the resolution, 
which passed unanimously, 
authorized LSA SG to partner 
with a variety of student 
organizations and campus 
resources such as Wolverine 
Support 
Network, 
Active 

Minds, the Sexual Assault 
Prevention 
Awareness 

Center (SAPAC) to host a 
day centered around mental 
health awareness on campus.

Speaking 
in 
favor 
of 

the resolution, Meier said 
promoting 
mental 
health 

this way has had a positive 
response at other universities

“The concept has been 

implemented 
in 
other 

colleges like Michigan State 
University, and has proved to 
have been very successful,” 
Meier said.

LSA 
sophomore 
Uriel 

Lee also emphasized the 
importance of making CAPS’ 
current services more well 
known.

Daily Staff Reporter

Crisis Text Line, the first free 

24-hour text support system for 
people in crises which utilizes in 
part the University of Michigan’s 
privacy 
and 
security 
policies, 

was made available as a resource 
for researchers on February 16, 
with the potential to broaden 
understanding of mental illness in 
youth. Researchers interested in 
using the service’s data must apply 
for access.

Along with the University’s 

policies, the Crisis Text Line data 
set also uses policies established by 
the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention and National Institutes 
of Health.

Launched in 2013 by CEO Nancy

Event part of second 

annual week on 

campus celebrating 

the city

By RACHEL COHEN

Daily Staff Reporter

The Detroit Partnership’s “The 

SOUP” event brought students 
together Wednesday to learn about 
Detroit-based charities through a 
collaborative environment and a 
soup dinner.

The event, part of the University 

of 
Michigan’s 
second 
annual 

Detroit Week, was modeled off 
of the Detroit SOUP, a micro-
granting dinner that sponsors 
Detroit-based projects and aims to 
foster a sense of community for its 
attendees.

The Detroit Partnership had 

hosted SOUP events for several 
years before Detroit Week started, 
and organizers said they were 

asked to come together with several 
other 
student 
organizations, 

including Semester in Detroit and 
the Black Student Union, to help 
initiate Detroit Week and continue 
the event this year.

Public 
Policy 
senior 
Blair 

Sucher, part of the recruitment 
staff of Semester in Detroit and one 
of the main organizers of Detroit 
Week for the past two years, told 
the audience the event was about 
broadening the narrow views in 
which many people see the city.

“Detroit Week is really about 

branching out from the norms of 
how we see Detroit...there are a lot 
of narratives that are talked about 
when you talk about Detroit,” she 
said. “The point of Detroit Week is 
really to broaden that view and see 
it from a different light.”

To participate in SOUP events, 

attendees pay a sum of money 
— in this case, $5 — which buys 
them dinner and a chance to vote 
on which charity idea they would 
like to see come to life. The money 

raised from the event goes directly 
to the winning project.

While 
most 
SOUP 
events 

end in a vote, due to last minute 
cancellations from two of the 
presenting groups, The Children 
of Detroit was the only charity 
to present and received the event 
earnings of $200.

The Children of Detroit is a non-

profit tutoring program started by 
Olivia McKinney and Courtney 
Blackett, Clarkston Junior High 
School freshmen. McKinney and 
Blackett said they and a few other 
tutors plan to travel to Schulze 
Academy for Technology and the 
Arts in Detroit to help the students 
grow and learn.

While they noted that they 

are starting small, they said 
their overall aim is to grow their 
organization to help students at 
various Detroit public schools and 
give them a fair chance at success.

McKinney and Blackett said 

the idea for the nonprofit stemmed 
from 
encouragement 
in 
their 

language arts class to create 
activist campaigns, and their 
passion for Detroit.

McKinney said she hoped by 

improving Detroit’s education 
system, 
it 
would 
improve 

perceptions of the city as a whole.

“I think that by helping kids in 

the school system and by helping 

the next generation, (people’s 
views) 
will 
improve 
slowly,” 

McKinney said.

Many of the students who 

attended the event were students 
involved in the Detroit Partnership. 
LSA senior Shannon Folster, who 
serves on the Education Team 
within the Detroit Partnership, 
said she thought SOUP fit into 
Detroit Week because it was a way 
of getting the campus together 
to support programs benefitting 
Detroit.

“It’s a cool way to get people 

together to celebrate something 
we’re interested in within Detroit 
context,” Folster said.

LSA 
senior 
Imran 
Hakim 

Mohamedsha, 
the 
Detroit 

Partnership’s education director, 
said he hopes attendees leave the 
event feeling inspired.

“If a freshman in high school 

could do something like a peer 
tutoring 
project, 
obviously 
as 

college students we have more 
resources and experience so I hope 
that we all feel a bit challenged to 
do a bit more,” he said.

LSA junior Amalia Gomez-

Rexrode said she attended because 
she volunteers at the Detroit 
Hispanic 
Development 
Center, 

adding that her experience as an 
out-of-state student spending time 
in Detroit has been meaningful. 

“I thought it was a wonderful 

event, definitely very casual, really 
conducive to good conversation 
and it was awesome to hear from 
these freshmen who were just so 
innovative and really want to make 
a difference so that was incredibly 
inspiring,” Gomez-Rexrode said.

opinions so that we can listen to 
those who disagree, because when 
we listen to those who disagree we 
discover the truth more,” she said. 
“I also think that we as a society 
are kind of moving towards a place 
where we feel that the question of 
abortion has been answered, but I 
think that there is a conversation 
that still needs to be had.”

Students for Life member Emily 

Stumpo, an LSA freshman, said 
she felt the pro-life argument 
should be heard, noting that she 
liked how Klusendorf took a 
philosophical approach. 

“I am personally pro-life, so 

I really appreciate the fact that 
the University allowed this to 
happen,” she said. “A lot of the 
time, in pro-life work, you get shut 
down really early on, so I really 
appreciate that. I really liked the 
balanced way his discussion went. 
It wasn’t religious, which is a large 
turnoff for a lot of people.”

Stumpo added she felt what she 

called a value for human life was 
an integral part of the lecture.

“I just enjoyed his passion for 

human life,” she said. “That’s 
something that I aspire to, as 
a psychologist. Life and the 
potential for people to have a 
productive life is something that 
we as people who have productive 
lives take for granted, and we don’t 

realize that we contribute to those 
lives that aren’t productive. I really 
appreciate people who do Scott’s 
work so that human life really gets 
the integrity and human life that it 
deserves.“

In an interview after the 

presentation, Klusendorf said he 
hopes to spark a new conversation.

“My goal is — if they’re pro-

choice — is to give them something 
they’ll think about,” he said. 
“That’s it. I don’t think we want 
to say people will not change their 
minds. I’m open to having my 
mind changed. I could be wrong. 
And then the way I keep an open 
mind is to listen to arguments from 
the other side. My goal was to give 
pro-choice students something to 
think about. My goal for the pro-

life students was to equip them 
to give an intelligent but gracious 
defense for the pro-life view.”

Klusendorf 
added 
that 
he 

thought it was important for 
different viewpoints to exist in a 
university setting.

“I think one of the most 

damaging 
things 
to 
a 
good 

education is political correctness 
that censors viewpoints and deems 
them to be unsafe or intolerant 
or somehow dangerous to the life 
of the community,” he said. “We 
ought to have a commitment to 
pursue the truth and follow the 
evidence wherever it leads and 
not close off certain things as off-
bounds because we don’t want to 
offend somebody.”

U.S. News released 

their annual list of 
graduate program 
rankings Wednesday, 
placing the University of 
Michigan in the top 15 for 
all 6 categories. Especially 
significant thiws year 
is the University’s Law 
School ranking, which 
jumped from eleventh to 
eighth nationally.

The list includes 

business, education, 
engineering, law, 
medicine and nursing 
programs.

Jeff Thomas, Kaplan 

Test Prep’s executive 
director of pre-law 
programs, said he thinks 
the Law School’s ranking 
is particularly exciting.

“The University of 

Michigan Law School 

jumped three spots in 
the U.S. News & World 
Report rankings, which 
is both notable and 
impressive because it’s 
a list where the order 
remains relatively static. 
It remains one of the most 
competitive JD programs 
in the country,” Thomas 
said.

The College of 

Engineering was ranked 
sixth nationally. The 
Medical School was 
ranked 11th for research 
and fourth for primary 
care. The Ross School of 
Business and the School 
of Education both made 
the list at number 12, and 
the School of Nursing 
was ranked seventh. 
Additionally, the Ford 
School of Public Policy, 

which is ranked every 3 
years, also made number 8 
on this list.

“U-M officials 

note that rankings are 
just one measure of a 
university,” a University 
press release said. “What 
matters most in choosing 
a school is the match 
between the particular 
interests, abilities 
and ambitions of each 
student with the specific 
programs, approaches and 
opportunities offered by a 
particular school.”

Five new members have been 

selected by the Michigan Society 
of Fellows to serve three-year 
appointments as postdoctoral 
scholars and assistant professors. 
The fellows will teach courses 
related to their departments 
and continue working on their 
research beginning next semester.

The new fellows include Aniket

Breakfast

University President Mark 

Schlissel went to Washington, D.C. 
on Wednesday to discuss his plans 
for academic excellence, diversity 
and making a public impact in 
research and education at the 
annual University of Michigan 
Congressional Breakfast. 

Schlissel also discussed the 

importance of the University Flint 
campus, especially with regard to 
the water crisis, according to the 
University press release. More than 
300 people were present at the 
event.

University alum Rep. Tom Price 

(R–Georgia) was the keynote 
speaker of the breakfast and 
spoke to the audience about how 
attending the University for both 
his bachelor’s and medical degrees 
changed his life and led to his 
successful career.

Airplane technology 
to be modeled after 
wings of birds

After receiving a $6 million 

grant from the Air Force Office 
of Scientific Research, an 
international team of researchers 
will create a high-tech bird model 
from which to later create airplane 
wing technology. 

The researchers, including 

those from the University 
aerospace engineering program 
and collaborators from around the 
country, Canada and the UK, will 
produce an analysis of bird flight 
and later apply this technology to 
aircrafts. The technology is meant 
to make planes faster and lighter 
than aircrafts currently in use. 

David Lentink, a professor 

at Stanford, decided to develop 
a system that would not harm 
small birds, and instead, would 
measure air pressure disturbances 
surrounding the bird. The system 
will allow the researchers to 
use their findings with the 
maneuverability and agility of a 
bird and apply it to materials that 
could alter an airplane wing’s 
shape to respond to environmental 
factors while in flight, according to 
the University press release. 

Engineers will focus on a 

variety of ways to morph wings for 
aircrafts and program computer 
controls to mimic neurons in a 
bird’s brain that instinctively 
collects airflow and pressure data.

NEWS BRIEFS

Those who ate red meat less 
than four times a week began 
their periods, on average, at 
the age of 12 years and eight 
months.

For fish, on the other hand, 

girls who consumed tuna or 
sardines at least once a week 
during their middle childhood 
years experienced menarche 
later than girls who consumed 
these fatty fish less than once a 
month.

Jansen noted that it cannot 

be 
said 
for 
sure whether 

environmental factors, such as 
higher availability of red meat 
in Bogota also contributed 
to the results. She noted that 
there also are no correlations 
between their findings and 
a generally earlier onset of 
puberty in Colombia compared 
to other countries.

However, this five month 

difference in age of first period 
ultimately has indications for 
both physical and behavioral 
health later in life, Jansen 
wrote.

“Earlier 
menarche 
has 

been related to higher risk 
of breast cancer in addition 
to 
other 
adverse 
health 

outcomes including obesity, 
type 2 diabetes, and all-cause 
mortality,” she wrote. “In the 
short term, an earlier age at 
menarche has been associated 
with 
earlier 
sexual 
debut, 

teen pregnancy, and abuse of 
alcohol and tobacco.”

Those 
physical 
health 

outcomes could be related to a 
number of factors, she added.

“We cannot say for sure what 

could explain the association, 
but it could be related to macro- 
or micronutrients present in 
red meat, substances fed to 
cattle, or components related 
to preservation or preparation 
of these meat sources,” Jansen 
wrote.

Sarah Ball, assistant dietetic 

internship 
director 
in 
the 

Department 
of 
Nutritional 

Sciences, 
echoed 
Jansen’s 

statement and said the way the 
cattle is raised can make a big 
difference in what humans end 
up consuming.

“At least in this country 

there’s 
a 
big 
difference 

between, or could potentially 
be a big difference between, 
your small ranching, grass-fed 
cattle and the meat we consume 
from that compared to your big, 
large industry-based grain-fed 
cattle production,” Ball said.

Ball 
said 
other 
factors 

besides red meat intake, such 
as body mass index, could 
also contribute to the time of 
puberty onset of young women. 
BMI can increase based on 
higher consumption rates of 
sugar-sweetened 
beverages 

and lower consumption rates of 
fruits and vegetables.

Ultimately, because this is 

only an observational study, 
earlier 
menarche 
cannot 

solely be attributed to higher 
red 
meat 
intake, 
Jansen 

wrote. Researchers suggested 
prepubescent girls should not 
necessarily limit their red meat 
intake to avoid menarche, but 
rather should consume red 
meat in moderation.

“We cannot conclude for 

sure that red meat intake causes 
early puberty from this study,” 
Villamor 
wrote. 
“Excessive 

red meat intake is probably 
not a good idea in general. It 
does not need to be completely 
abolished from the diet, but 
it can be eaten sparsely and 
replaced with other sources of 
animal protein, for example, 
fish.”

Though recommended diets 

change based on demographics 
and geographics, the general 
recommendation 
for 
the 

best diet for people living in 
the United States, including 
children in middle childhood 
years, is a varied diet as 
found in the Current Dietary 
Guidelines 
for 
Americans, 

according to Ball.

“It’s a (dietary) pattern that 

includes a variety of fruits and 
vegetables, whole fruits instead 
of juice, vegetables from a 
variety of different groups and 
different colors, whole grains, 
low-fat dairy and a variety of 
protein foods,” she said.”Really 
focusing on seafood and those 
lean meats — poultry, eggs, 
beans, nuts and seeds — and 
then healthy oils, with a limit 
on sugar-sweetened beverages 
and more processed products.”

resources 
CAPS 
currently 

has, because most of them fly 
under the radar,” Lee said. 
“We can only fund so many 
new programs, and we need 
to put up our resources at the 
forefront.”

The representatives also 

passed resolutions requesting 

that LSA officially recognizes 
the International Day for 
the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination 
and 
the 

creation of a “Before I Die” 
wall for students to post their 
bucket list items in Angell 
Hall. 

In 
addition, 
a 

resolution 
advocating 
the 

implementation of a “Let’s 
Talk” CAPS on North Campus 
was proposed.

LSA 
sophomore 
Joey 

Hansel said one of CAPS’ 
focuses in the coming years 
should be on students in more 
isolated parts of campus.

“We need to help facilitate 

the 
conversation,” 
Hansel 

said. “It’s a sad truth, but 
CAPS is underfunded, and, as 
the LSA Student Government, 
we should focus on funding 
CAPS 
and 
helping 
these 

students.”

Meier, 
another 
sponsor 

of the resolution, said no 

matter where students live 
on campus, they should be 
afforded the same access to 
mental health resources.

“People 
should 
not 
be 

prevented from having access 
to the same resources as 
other students just because 
of where they were randomly 
assigned to live,” he said. “We 
need to get something there 
now, so they can get the help 
they need now. Not in a month 
or five years, but now.”

A CSG resolution that aimed to 

support undocumented students 
by advocating for the extension of 
in-state tuition to undocumented 
students was an early topic of 
contention. LSA senior Keysha 
Wall, the Defend Affirmative 
Action 
Party 
presidential 

candidate, criticizing both Your 
Michigan and newMich for their 
response to it. In her opening 
remarks, Wall challenged her 
opponents to take a stronger 
stance on on the resolution, citing 
Your 
Michigan’s 
presidential 

candidates’ 
decision 
to 
vote 

against the resolution.

newMICH 
presidential 

candidate David Schafer, an 
LSA junior, agreed with Wall, 
charging that Hislop interrupted 
two women of color while 
debating the resolution. 

In 
response, 
Hislop 
said 

he supported the spirit of the 
resolution, but the content of 
it wasn’t well planned. He also 
said the two women involved in 
the conversation agreed with 
him and emphasized that he 
supported the message behind 

the resolution.

Beyond 
the 
resolution, 

candidates 
also 
sought 
to 

show how they were different 
as a party on a number of 
other fronts. In speaking to 
their 
platform 
during 
the 

presidential 
debate, 
Your 

Michigan heavily emphasized 
the tangibility of their goals and 
their interest in working with 
the University administration 
closely, criticizing what they 
called 
newMICH’s 
strategy 

of 
“demands.” 
In 
Schafer 

responded to those criticisms 
by calling Hislop’s emphasis on 
working with the administration 
rather than demanding changes 
an example of privilege, saying 
that minorities had a right to 
demand modifications to current 
policies.

The 
theme 
of 
showing 

difference continued in the vice 
presidential debate, most notably 
when candidates were asked if 
they considered the University to 
be “great,” referring to the slogan 
of GOP presidential candidate 
Donald Trump, “Make America 
Great Again.”

newMICH 
vice-presidential 

candidate 
Micah 
Griggs, 

an LSA junior, charged that 

Your Michigan had referred 
incorrectly to Black students in 
their platform.

“When first addressing Black 

students, they first called them 
intercity, then they called them 
urban and then finally called them 
underrepresented,” Griggs said.

She added that she thought 

Your Michigan’s platform was 
full of “condescending language,” 
calling it similar to an attitude 
she said the University presents 
that keeps many Black students 
from attending.

In response, Your Michigan 

vice-presidential candidate Cam 
Dotson, an LSA junior, defended 
his use of using “intercity” and 
“urban” as correct language 
he learned from his sociology 
classes.

The debate also touched on the 

presence of Greek life — which 
several candidates belong to — on 
campus.

Hislop 
referenced 
his 

leadership position in Greek life, 
saying he accepted it because he 
wanted to bring about change. 
He said he hopes to see safer 
measures for students, such as 
earlier dining hall hours and 
safer tailgates.

Wall said she believed that 

Greek 
life 
supports 
women 

in their time in college and 
provides sisterhood, but also 
said that the University needs to 
address sexual assault and rape 
on campus. Wall and Okorom 
both put heavy emphasis on the 
expulsion and outing of rapists on 
campus throughout the debate, 
stating the University had a 
history of covering up incidents.

After the debate, current CSG 

President Cooper Charlton, an 
LSA senior, said he believed that 
DAAP’s closing speech was most 
passionate.

During the remarks, Wall 

stated that CSG had previously 
let 
students 
be 
oppressed, 

citing DAAP’s experiences with 
protesting on campus.

“I was very moved by the 

passion, and that was something I 
really resonated with as a leader,” 
Charlton said.

He noted that the issues being 

discussed this year include an 
underlying distrust for CSG.

“I definitely think CSG has a 

lack of trust from student body 
right now,” Charlton said. “It’s 
something we’ve tried to fight 
this year, and unfortunately I 
don’t think we completed our 
goal.”

ideation, coming out as gay, 
bullying and sexual or physical 
abuse, according to the comapny’s 
Chief Data Scientist Bob Filbin.

Depression, a common mental 

health 
issue, 
affects 
nearly 

14.8 million American adults, 
according to the Depression and 
Bipolar Support Alliance. Among 
youth, untreated depression is 
the number one risk for suicide. 
When someone texts theCrisis 
Text Line, they immediately 
receive an automated message 
asking about the type of crisis they 
are experiencing. Within a few 
minutes, a live and trained crisis 
counselor will begin responding 
to the texts to help the texter with 
their crisis.

The Crisis Text Line has not 

yet begun working with any 
researchers, as the first round of 
applications opened February 16 
and will close April 1. Following 
the close of the application, 
those at the Crisis Text Line will 
spend two months reviewing 
the project applications, and will 
release the data on June 1 to the 
first cohort of researchers. Filbin 
said the company’s data is crucial 
in promoting and encouraging 
research 
on 
personal 
crises 

because as the first of its kind, 
it’s able to reach a new group of 
individuals seeking help.

To date, the Crisis Text Line 

has exchanged 14.5 million text 

messages between texters and 
crisis counselors, making it the 
largest data set on crisis in the 
United States, Filbin said. The 
count increases by roughly one 
million messages per month. 

LSA sophomore Mary O’Brien, 

president 
of 
the 
University’s 

chapter of the National Alliance on 
Mental Illness — an organization 
which focuses on mental health 
advocacy on campus — said she 
thought services like these are 
an important resources because 
of the atmosphere surrounding 
mental illness.

“Especially in the competitive 

culture at U of M, many students 
don’t seek help because it’s easy 
to mistake symptoms of a mental 
illness 
for 
normal 
academic 

stress,” O’Brien said. “Without 
seeking help, the stress can 
snowball and make the problem 
worse. Crisis text lines, I think, 
are particularly effective because 
a lot of students name preferring 
to deal with their issues on their 
own and not having time as two 
major reasons for why they do not 
seek help. I think crisis text lines 
address both of these problems.”

O’Brien 
said 
she 
believes, 

especially in a technological 
age, crisis text lines are the best 
way for people in need to receive 
immediate help.

“Technology is becoming an 

increasingly important tool for 
reaching people in crisis,” O’Brien 
said. “Crisis text lines specifically 
succeed in reaching people who 
might not otherwise seek help for 

mental illness.”

“We think that this data, when 

shared with researchers that 
have been starved for access to 
this kind of data, is really going to 
allow the crisis space to increase 
its effectiveness as a whole in 
supporting people in crisis,” Filbin 
said.

The process behind allowing 

researchers to access the data, 
according to Filbin, includes 
an online application requiring 
approval 
from 
a 
college’s 

Institutional Review Board, as 
well as approval from the Crisis 
Text Line Data Ethics Committee.

Filbin said any research project 

that is accepted to use the data set 
has to reach four benchmarks: 
ethics, privacy, security and value.

Those who text the Crisis Text 

Line often expect to get help 
while simultaneously remaining 
anonymous. Because of this, 
Filbin said the service provides 
an electronic privacy policy at the 
start of each conversation and will 
assure anonymity when releasing 
the data for further research. 

“It’s an anonymous service, so 

when you text in we don’t require 
that you provide any demographic 
information or name,” Filbin 
said. “Our rule is, we only ask for 
information when it’s valuable to 
the texter.”

In extreme cases, however, 

Filbin said a texter’s address is 
requested to direct emergency 
services to their location.

The Crisis Text Line also 

operates through an enclave 

data system, meaning all of the 
data stays within their system. 
Researchers accepted to utilize the 
data will log in through a network 
through a secure data enclave. 
As an additional precaution, the 
service “scrubs” the conversations 
of any personally identifiable 
information that was shared 
by the texter prior to the data’s 
release to researchers.

So far, more than 100 research 

teams have expressed interest in 
gaining access to the data, and 
applications have exemplified a 
wide range of projects, Filbin said. 
For example, researchers from 
the United States Department 
of Transportation are interested 
in looking at how the data 
might be applicable in reducing 
railroad suicide. A team at the 
Kempe Center of the Children’s 
Hospital in Colorado is focusing 
on revealing better ways of 
identifying cases of child abuse, 
and researchers at the University 
of Utah are interested in the 
relationship between altitude and 
suicidal ideation.

Filbin said he looks forward 

to improving the quality of the 
Crisis Text Line service on an 
internal level, as well as improving 
the quality of crisis counseling 
nationwide through each research 
expert who gains access to the 
data.

“I think it’s definitely a unique 

data set that has a lot of potential 
to really make a difference for 
people in crisis,” Filbin said.

— Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland, in response to a question about 

judicial activism at his 1995 confirmation hearing.

“

NOTABLE QUOTABLE

Federal judges do not have roving 

commissions to solve societal problems. The 
role of the court is to apply law to the facts 
of the case before it … not to legislate, not to 
arrogate to itself the executive power, not to 

hand down advisory opinion on 

the issues of the day.

T

he last time I ate fast food 
was in November. I watched 
the employee at Wendy’s 

pour 
frozen, 
asymmetrically 

shaped chicken 
nuggets 
into 

the deep fryer 
and my stomach 
churned. 
I 

observed another 
employee 
emerge from a 
dark, mysterious 
area in the back 
of the kitchen 
with bundles of 
buns, 
burgers 

and 
lettuce. 

The smell of grease and salt filled 
my nostrils as I watch french fries 
unthaw in the deep fryer. I gently 
rested my hand on my stomach, 
offering an apology to my body for 
waiting so late to eat that fast food 
restaurants were our only choices for 
nourishment.

I apologized to the chickens 

that were likely mistreated and fed 
with hormones or unnatural foods 
because people like me demanded 
it — one in three American children 
and adolescents receive a portion 
of their daily intake of calories 
from 
fast 
food. 
Most 
people 

would assume that economically 
disadvantaged groups make up 
the 
majority 
of 
this 
statistic, 

but researchers have noted that 
middle-class people are frequent 
fast food consumers, too — because 
this demographic is made up of 
people with increasingly busy lives 
who are often pressed for time, they 
appreciate the convenience of drive-
through 
windows. 
Additionally, 

most food stamp programs do not 
permit fast food orders, though 
this is circumstantial on a state-
by-state basis, varying by a state’s 
participation in the Restaurant 
Meal Program.

Economics 
are 
at 
the 
core 

of 
food 
sustainability 
issues. 

Nutritionally deprived foods are 
produced with less input costs and 
in higher quantities. Nourishing 
foods that are recommended by 
the Food and Drug Administration 
dietary guidelines, such as fruits, 
vegetables and proteins are more 
expensive to buy. Population studies 
have demonstrated the disparities 
between food and social class: 
According to the American Journal 
of Clinical Nutrition, food-desert 
and 
food-insecure 
communities, 

which are often low-income, tend to 
consume unbalanced diets.

Food insecurity is not a natural 

construct; it was made by design. 
Certain communities are restricted 
geographically and economically 
from attaining the four dimensions 
of 
food 
security: 
availability 

(sufficient amount), access (physical, 

social and economic ability to 
obtain), food utilization (nutritious 
and safe food that meets dietary 
needs) 
and 
stability 
(available 

consistently 
over 
time). 
People 

should not have to choose between 
purchasing fruits and vegetables 
or a full meal at McDonald’s, yet 
millions of Americans must make 
these decisions daily. Fresh and 
nutritious 
goods 
have 
become 

luxury goods, which means it is 
“economic elitism” to advocate 
widespread adoption of nutritious 
diets without also addressing issues 
of affordability.

Even though economics are clearly 

at play here, lower-income families 
could also be consuming fast food 
simply because, just like missions of 
other Americans, they like the taste 
of sugary, fatty and processed foods. 
This is just as legitimate a reason 
to consume fast food as potential 
economic advantages.

The 
industrialization 
and 

commodification of food, paired 
with 
the 
on-the-go 
American 

lifestyle, has also led to an increase 
in engineered food in general, 
which 
ultimately 
impacts 
our 

health, nutrition and our lifestyles. 
These updates in technology and 
legislation 
have 
permitted 
the 

use of cheaper products, such 
as refined wheat, high-fructose 
corn syrup and artificial meats, 
which 
have 
proliferated 
store 

shelves, commercial restaurants 
and 
school 
cafeterias. 
Studies 

have shown that these foods are 
linked the exponential growth of 
health complications Americans 
have. A large percentage of our 
foods are injected with fat, sugar 
and artificial preservatives that 
some scientists argue override our 
appetite-suppressing 
hormones, 

stimulating an addiction to food 
that can ultimately lead to obesity.

A 
number 
of 
consumers, 

filmmakers and legislators have 
challenged 
the 
way 
companies 

process our food. But the food 
industry’s profits are so deeply 
entrenched 
in 
inexpensive 

production 
strategies 
that 
any 

transformative 
change 
seems 

virtually impossible.

Food sustainability seems to be a 

less politicized issue to rally around, 
yet food industry lobbyists still 
strong-arm politicians in a way that 
perpetuates inequities in the types 
of food available in communities. 
Eating has henceforth become a 
political act.

Though the food industry may 

not modify its practices to be more 
sustainable and consumer-friendly 
in the short term, consumers have 
demanded to know what is in the 
products they are eating. Consumer 
choice plays a large role in ensuring 
a sustainable food system for all, 

but in order for consumers to make 
informed choices, consumers need 
to be informed and educated about 
the foods available to them. Food 
education, therefore, is an important 
part of developing a knowledgeable 
consumer base.

The language about food has 

changed just as quickly as seasonal 
fashions. Labels such as non-GMOs, 
 

natural, 
all-natural, 
gluten-free, 

organic, 
farm-raised, 
free-range, 

refined, enriched and fortified are 
just a few of the many markers 
on store-bought products used to 
both entice and inform consumers 
of what ingredients comprise the 
final product. This jargon can be 
bewildering, but it can also serve as 
a key element in building consumer 
efficacy in their food choices.

The distinction between “healthy” 

and “nutritious” is just as important 
in determining sustainability. Food 
itself cannot be “healthy.” We as 
humans can be healthy, but food 
is nutritious. “Healthy” describes 
overall well-being, whether that 
is in food or finances. “Nutritious” 
describes a food or drink that 
provides nutrients.

Adopting a nutritious diet has to 

begin early. Children are not born 
liking avocados or donuts. What 
adults feed their children shapes 
children’s taste buds and their 
tolerance of specific foods. The 
food industry uses advertisements 
to entice children to eat sugary 
cereals, cinnamon rolls and candy. 
Parents have to be autonomous 
in educating their children about 
the variety of foods available that 
best support our bodies’ needs. We 
must not jeopardize the present and 
future needs of generations to come.

American 
food 
production 

practices 
obstruct 
food 

sustainability, an issue that impacts 
the American political and social 
landscape. The demand for food 
systems to adjust their practices is 
an immediate need — by 2050, the 
world will need to feed 9.7 billion 
people, evoking a consequential 
human and environmental cost on 
our Earth’s resources.

Food sustainability is not just 

about food. It intersects with 
land use, housing, poverty and 
democracy. Legislatures need to 
be more proactive in promoting 
food sustainability by addressing 
issues of nutritious food access 
and production. The agriculture 
industry has a three-part challenge, 
as SciDevNet outlines: “to increase 
agricultural production, especially 
of nutrient-rich foods, to do so in 
ways which reduce inequality and 
to reverse and prevent resource 
degradation.”

Much needed change to MIP law 

The Michigan House must support fairer punishments
O

n March 3, the Michigan Senate passed a bill that would reduce 
the consequences of a minor in possession charge. If approved 
by the state House, the bill would make an MIP a civil infraction 

for the first offense, becoming a misdemeanor only in subsequent 
offenses, meaning a first offense would not go on the offender’s record. 
Fines would also be lighter for MIP offenses under the new law. While 
further evaluation of the laws regulating the drinking age itself, as 
well as the implementation of such laws may be warranted on both the 
state and national level, this new state law concerning consequences is 
a much needed change. The new law can potentially serve to lessen the 
disproportionate impact of MIP laws on underprivileged minority groups 
and will help create a safer climate around drinking.

The penalties for receiving MIPs under 

the current law are too harsh. As it stands, 
anyone under the legal drinking age of 21 
found in possession of or attempting to buy 
alcohol can be charged with a misdemeanor, 
and can receive up to a $100 fine with 
probation. A second violation includes up to 
a $200 dollar fine and possible jail time of up 
to 30 days if the party violates probation. A 
third violation may have consequences of a 
fine up to $500 and possible imprisonment 
of no more than 60 days if the charged party 
violates probation.

Lessening 
the 
severity 
of 
overall 

punishment along with reducing fines for 
MIPs can lessen the disproportionate effect 
laws like this have on underprivileged 
minorities. Minorities are more likely to have 
lower socioeconomic status, which puts them 
at a disadvantage in the legal system. While 
students with access to financial resources 
may easily pay any fines incurred and hire 
lawyers who will help them avoid jail time, 
those with lower socioeconomic status face a 
more significant financial burden to cover the 
cost of fines, and they may be unable to hire 
lawyers all together.

By changing the first offense from a 

misdemeanor to a civil infraction, the new 
law also lessens the long-term impact of 
a first-offense MIP on citizens. Having a 
misdemeanor on one’s record after just a first 
offense can have consequences that reach far 
into the offender’s future beyond fines and 
jail time.

Law enforcement already acknowledges that 

underage drinking occurs, as evidenced by the 
state of Michigan’s medical amnesty law. To 
promote safe and responsible practices, the 
law exempts those who voluntarily present 
themselves or their friend to law enforcement 
from 
receiving 
an 
MIP 
because 
they 

demonstrate an alcohol-induced “legitimate 
health care concern.” This new law for MIPs 
follows in the trend of the medical amnesty law 
because it seeks to create a less punishment-
heavy approach toward underage drinking.

This kind of law-enforcement mentality 

can serve to make campus climates safer 
on college campuses across the state (Just 
as the medical amnesty law works toward 
this goal, a more affordable fine and lighter 
consequences from a first violation could 
make students less concerned about trying 
to hide their activity.) The medical amnesty 
law recognizes that when students are less 
likely to hide underage drinking, they are 
more likely to seek help when something 
goes wrong. This new MIP law could serve a 
similar purpose.

And while some may argue a disadvantage 

of this law is that the police may be more 
willing to write the first citation, this 
willingness could actually be an advantage, 
serving as a justifiable warning to offenders 
who violate the law. Since the first violation 
does not result in a misdemeanor and 
therefore does not appear on one’s record, 
a first offense as a warning wouldn’t be 
detrimental 
to 
the 
offender’s 
future. 

Additionally, law-enforcement officers who 
feel more comfortable issuing citations may 
be less likely to issue them subjectively. A 
police force that is less likely to cherry pick 
who gets cited is more likely to garner respect 
from citizens.

As 
well, 
studies 
have 
shown 
legal 

punishments 
are 
not 
necessarily 
the 

determining factor in one’s decision to 
commit a crime. Therefore, a more severe 
law like the one that currently stands doesn’t 
necessarily curb underage drinking. Further, 
a weaker law cannot be argued to encourage 
underage drinking.

It is all too clear that the MIP law needs to 

change, as the current law employs unjustly 
harsh punishments. The new legislation has 
the potential to lessen the impact of MIPs on 
underprivileged minority populations, makes 
the important shift from a misdemeanor to a 
civil infraction upon the first offense and can 
help create a healthier mentality surrounding 
underage drinking and relations with law-
enforcement officials.

When someone finds out that I 

actually know a thing or two about 
baseball and basketball, I get a few 
different reactions: “Wow, I didn’t 
know you liked sports. That’s 
cool,” “It’s funny how into sports 
you are; I wouldn’t have guessed” 
or “I don’t meet a lot of girls who 
like to watch sports as much as 
you do.” And by now, I have come 
to largely anticipate an eyebrow 
raise or head tilt, as if to say, “Are 
you serious?”

Looking back on the countless 

times I’ve heard someone utter these 
phrases, I realize that the majority 
of these comments come from guys. 
These comments seem to come from a 
widespread disbelief that women can 
be, and are, serious sports fans, too. 
And it’s not just guys — there have 
even been a few times my girlfriends 
have made similar comments, as if 
they have internalized the notion 
that female sports fans have to be 
something rare.

My favorite comment came from 

my one of my closest girlfriends a 
while back: “Guys think it’s cool 
when a girl is into sports.” She 
said this as though one of the 
reasons I should like sports is 
so guys will think I’m cool. And 
while not everyone has reacted 
in these ways, comments like this 
one are among the most common 
I receive from people outside my 
own family. These reactions speak 
to the ways in which we have 
gendered sports to the point that 
female sports fans seem to exist as 
anomalies. 

When I was younger, I was 

content knowing people thought 
it was exceptionally cool that I, as 
a girl, liked sports. But then it got 
to be a chore, constantly explaining 

why I got into sports (“because 
your mom certainly was never this 
into sports”) or if I just liked the 
San Francisco Giants after they 
won their first championship, even 
though they’re my home team. And 
it got tiresome trying to explain 
that I liked sports because I was 
interested in sports and I wasn’t 
trying to impress anyone. And after 
a while, I realized it shouldn’t be 
considered cool that a girl likes 
sports. It should be considered 
normal. But the sad reality is that 
it isn’t, because many people — at 
least many I’ve talked to — think 
that female sports fans are few and 
far between.

Contrary to this popular notion, 

women attend professional sports 
games in significant numbers. A 
study conducted by Scarborough 
Sports Marketing in 2010 showed 
that females comprised 41.2 percent 
of MLB game attendees and 36.4 
percent of NBA game attendees. 
What’s more, the study found 
that percentages of females who 
attended 
professional 
hockey, 

football, soccer and NASCAR events 
also hovered at about 40 percent.

Even though I realize I shouldn’t 

have to, I still rush to justify why 
I’m a fan, explaining how my dad 
got me into sports when I was 4 
years old and that I’ve loved them 
ever since. I even throw in the 
name of a player who is no longer 
on the team to prove I’m not just a 
bandwagon fan; to prove that I’m 
not just talking a big talk. But I 
need to stop doing this because I 
shouldn’t have to prove myself.

Some people are fanatics. They 

know every stat, every player 
and every rule of the game. I 
am definitely not one of those 

people, but I feel like I have to 
be in order to be considered a 
fan at all. But do men hold each 
other to these same standards? 
Sometimes 
I 
mistake 
two 

players, but don’t we all?

I shouldn’t be held to a higher 

standard of knowledge than my 
male 
counterparts, 
simply 
to 

prove that I enjoy sports. Can’t 
I ask questions, too, like a guy 
would ask his buddy, without it 
being chalked up to me being a girl 
who doesn’t know as much about 
sports as she says?

Women are often met with 

similar surprises when they say they 
want to be doctors, businesswomen, 
scientists or lawyers. And the 
reality is that until a few decades 
ago these fields, along with sports, 
were “boys’ clubs.” For many years, 
women weren’t allowed at Ivy 
League schools and there were zero 
women in many top professions. 
And though the numbers have not 
changed significantly, they have 
changed at least a little for the 
better. In 2015, according to the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics, women 
comprised 27.9 percent of chief 
executives, 34.5 percent of lawyers 
and 37.9 percent of physicians and 
surgeons combined.

We shouldn’t have to qualify our 

answers or choices with reasons 
why. As mathematicians or sports 
fans, we shouldn’t be treated as 
anomalies, or we will always be 
anomalies. I shouldn’t have to 
prove myself and nor should any 
other woman.

No, it’s not cool I like sports. I 

just like sports. End of story.

Michigan wins WNIT opener

By LELAND MITCHINSON 

Daily Sports Writer

In its first action in nearly two 

weeks, the Michigan women’s 
basketball 
team 
needed 
time to get 
back into the rhythm of things. 
But after a lackluster first half in 
the Wolverines’ WNIT opener 
Wednesday against Wright State, 
they found their usual high-
scoring form and beat the Raiders 
handily, 81-53.

Michigan (9-9 Big Ten, 18-13 

overall) 
struggled 
with 
foul 

trouble all season, and it looked 
like that wouldn’t change for 
the start of postseason play. 
The Wolverines committed six 
team fouls in the first quarter, 
including two from senior guard 
Madison Ristovski, who made a 
record-tying 133rd appearance 
for Michigan and moved into 10th 
place on the program’s career 
made 3-pointers list. However, 
Michigan 
kept 
things 
under 

control the rest of the game, 
committing just four fouls.

Much of the game flow in the 

first half depended on the post 
players from each team. The 
Wolverines began their offensive 
attack with a concentrated effort 
to get the ball to freshman center 
Hallie Thome in the post, but it 
was largely unsuccessful due to 
the back-side help from Wright 
State (12-6 Horizon League, 24-11 
overall) that took away the lob 
pass opportunities for Michigan.

“I think we talked about ‘Hey, 

if they’re fronting her and there 
is help from the backside, let’s 
not throw her the ball. And if we 
do throw her the ball, we’re just 
trying to get the defense to sink in, 
so let’s throw it in and kick it out,’ 
” said Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico. “I thought we did a much 
better job of that in the second 
half, making extra passes and 

then our shots were open shots.”

The primary matchup in the 

post pitted Thome against a fellow 
6-foot-5 center, Wright State’s 
Richelle van der Keijl, who did 
her best to limit the freshman. For 
the most part, Keijl was successful 
and held Thome to three first-half 
points. Keijl finished the game 
with a double-double, scoring 19 
points and collecting 10 boards.

Though 
the 
Wolverines’ 

top two scorers, Thome and 
sophomore 
guard 
Katelynn 

Flaherty, struggled to get things 
going in the first half, the rest 
of the team picked up the slack. 
Thome and Flaherty combined for 
10 points, but Michigan still went 
into halftime with a 37-32 lead.

“I think we all have the ability 

to step up when others are not 
at their best or are struggling a 
little bit,” said junior guard Siera 
Thompson. “I think all our guards 
and all our posts have the ability 

to do that. I just try to do whatever 
is needed of me.”

Thompson, usually the player 

charged with getting the ball in 
the hands of the scorers, led the 
team with 13 first-half points. 
Junior guard Danielle Williams 
scored a career-high 10 points in 
the opening frame and finished 12 
total in just her third start of the 
season.

“I was just excited to play 

again,” Williams said. “I feel like 
every day is exciting when it’s 
gameday. My teammates and my 
coaches instill a lot of confidence 
in me and they were finding me.”

Added Barnes Arico: “I think 

she has a great knowledge, but she 
plays incredibly hard and has a 
great toughness about her, and she 

showed that this week in practice.”

Michigan showed just how 

dangerous it can be coming out 
of 
halftime. 
The 
Wolverines 

outscored Wright State, 23-7, in 
the third quater and jumped to a 
60-39 lead with one frame to play.

With the team’s turnaround 

came a personal turnaround for 
Flaherty, who finished the game 
with a team-high 22 points. 
Thompson finished with 19 points, 
five rebounds and six assists.

Michigan cruised through the 

fourth quarter to kickstart its 
postseason run with a victory. 
The Wolverines will look to keep 
the momentum going when they 
play their WNIT second-round 
game against either Bucknell or 
Akron on Saturday.

‘M’ dominates

By TED JANES 

Daily Sports Writer

Thursday, 
the 
Michigan 

women’s basketball team won by 
28 points, a benchmark it hasn’t 
accomplished since Dec. 19.

Against Wright State in the 

first round of the Women’s 
National Invitation Tournament, 
the Wolverines (9-9 Big Ten, 
18-13 overall) cruised to victory, 
dominating in the second half en 
route to an 81-53 win.

It has been a while since the 

Wolverines looked this good, 
but it has also been a while since 
they’ve played a team that knew 
this little about them.

“Our players were surprised 

at times that they were open for 
shots — so open — whereas our 
conference 
opponents 
really 

test those shots and really know 
what we do inside and out and 
take those things away,” said 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico. “Tonight, we had some 
really good looks when we 
executed 
our 
stuff, 
because 

they didn’t have a ton of time to 
prepare for us.”

Unlike opponents such as 

Iowa, which has seen Michigan 
three times already this season, 
the Raiders had just four days 
to prepare after falling in the 
Horizon 
League 
Women’s 

Basketball 
Tournament 

semifinal.

Wright 
State 
would 
have 

known that sophomore guard 
Katelynn Flaherty is as good 
as advertised, and that 6-foot-5 
freshman center Hallie Thome is 
tough to stop in the post. But the 
Raiders didn’t know about junior 
guard Siera Thompson, junior 

guard 
Danielle 
Williams 
or 

senior guard Madison Ristovski, 
who combined for 39 points 
Thursday.

While the bracket was just 

released Monday, the Wolverines 
had at least ample time to rest, 
having last played in the Big Ten 
Tournament on March 3.

In fact, the Wolverines hadn’t 

played in so long they actually 
felt like it was the preseason 
again. It reminded them of a time 
before they had to meet Big Ten 
opponents, a time when Michigan 
rolled past defenses in a similar 
fashion to the way it did Thursday.

“They felt like tonight was the 

first game of the year,” Barnes 
Arico said. “I think that’s an 
incredible feeling, because they 
had that drive, that passion, that 
energy level back. They were 
rested and ready to go.”

Added Thompson: “It had 

the first game jitters, I think 
that’s why we came out off, kind 
of rusty, but it was definitely 
exciting to get out there.”

Thompson scored 19 points 

along with five rebounds and six 
assists, and provided Michigan 
with 
consistent 
scoring 

throughout the night. But as 
Thompson mentioned, the rest of 
the team was not so hot getting 
out of the gate.

Michigan trailed by two points 

at the end of the first quarter, as 
Wright State took advantage of a 
lackluster, ugly performance in 
the opening 10 minutes.

But as the game went on, 

Michigan took control against 
the inferior opponent — shooting 
57 percent in the second half 
compared to 35 in the first — and 
ended the Raiders’ season.

Wolverines pound 
Eastern Michigan

By ORION SANG 

Daily Sports Writer

Sara Driesenga lined up in the 

circle.

Eastern Michigan’s leadoff hitter 

dug 
into 

her 
stance, 

the 
infield 

readied themselves and the fifth-
year senior right-hander uncorked 
the first pitch of the game.

Softball was back in Ann Arbor.
No. 2 Michigan (21-2 overall) 

played its first home game of the 
season Wednesday, notching a 
14-1 run-rule victory over Eastern 
Michigan backed by its potent 
offense and a strong performance 
from Driesenga.

“I thought we were locked 

in,” said Michigan coach Carol 
Hutchins. “Honestly, the first 
day at home is sometimes very 
distracting. We’ve been on the road 
(for) 22 games. These kids have not 
had a day where they have had a 
home routine, where they go to 
class (and) ride the MGoBlue bus. 
It’s a change in format.”

Michigan began its offensive 

onslaught early, scoring three runs 
in the first inning. After senior 
second baseman Sierra Romero and 
junior left fielder Kelly Christner 
were both walked, senior right 
fielder Kelsey Susalla cleared the 
bases with a three-run home run.

Eastern Michigan got one run 

back in the second inning, when 
right fielder Michelle Kriegshauser 
blasted a pitch onto the adjacent 
baseball field.

But the Wolverines came right 

back in the bottom of the inning.

Freshman 
infielder 
Faith 

Canfield — who started at second 
with Abby Ramirez out due to 
a sprained ankle — was hit by a 
pitch, senior centerfielder Sierra 
Lawrence walked and Romero 
singled up the middle to bring 
Canfield home.

If not for good defense by the 

Eagles, the Wolverines could’ve 
broken the game open that same 
inning. After a Christner walk 
loaded the bases, Susalla ripped a 

ball toward first base. But Eagles 
first baseman Olivia Logan was up 
to the task, corralling the ball to get 
the force out. Though a Michigan 
run crossed home plate, Eastern 
Michigan 
escaped 
the 
inning 

having given up just two runs.

In the third inning, though, 

Michigan 
scored 
four 
more 

runs to increase its lead to eight. 
Junior third baseman Lindsey 
Montemarano crushed a two-run 
homer over the left-center-field 
fence, while Lawrence and Romero 
also crossed the plate in the inning.

With Michigan cruising, the 

fourth inning was much of the 
same.

Driesenga gave up a leadoff 

double, but was able to escape the 
inning unscathed. Montemarano 
continued her production in the 
bottom of the inning, when she hit 
a long double to add another run 
to Michigan’s lead. Canfield got in 
on the action in the fourth as well, 
hitting a three-run shot to left field 
for her first career homer.

Driesenga returned to the circle 

for the fifth inning, inducing three 
quick outs to clinch the 14-1 run-
rule victory.

The right-hander’s win pushed 

her record to 11-0 and continued a 
streak of impressive outings. She 
gave up just two hits on the day, 
while striking out five.

Driesenga was quick to credit 

her teammates when asked what 
was critical to her success.

“Trusting 
myself, 
trusting 

whatever pitch is called, trusting 
the defense, and even trusting the 
offense that they’re going to score 
runs,” Driesenga said. “Trust in 
general is all-encompassing.”

It was the type of complete 

performance that Hutchins is 
looking for from her team.

“It was great that we got a lot 

of runs,” Hutchins said. “But I 
thought 
everybody 
contributed 

and did their part. Sara (Driesenga) 
did a fantastic job. Gave up the 
early home run but (it) didn’t faze 
her. She was a great leader for 
everybody, and it was fun to get all 
the young kids in.”

Irvin’s clutch 3 
leads Wolverines 
past Tulsa, on to 

Notre Dame

By JACOB GASE 

Daily Sports Editor

DAYTON, 
Ohio 
— 
The 

Michigan men’s basketball team 
got the NCAA Tournament bid 
it was sweating for on Selection 
Sunday — as a No. 11 seed playing 
in the First Four at University of 
Dayton Arena — and it initially 
looked like 
it received 
a favorable 
opponent 
as well.

After 
the 
bracket 
was 

released, no team in the field 
received more criticism than 
the 
Wolverines’ 
opponent, 

fellow No. 11 seed Tulsa. Even 
though the Golden Hurricane 
finished the season with a 20-11 
record, most experts had them 
projected well on the wrong 
side of the bubble after they lost 
to Memphis by 22 points in the 
American Athletic Conference 
Tournament.

But once the game actually 

began 
Wednesday 
night, 
it 

progressed as a back-and-forth 
affair. 

Both 
teams 
traded 
leads 

throughout the second half, 
and Tulsa found itself leading, 
60-59, with a minute to play. But 
junior forward Zak Irvin — just 
six days after hitting the game-
winner against Northwestern in 
the Big Ten Tournament — had 

more heroics left in him.

With 53 seconds remaining, 

Irvin hit a 3-pointer to put 
the Wolverines back on top, 
saving their season once again. 
Michigan (23-12) iced the game 
from the free-throw line and 
escaped with a 67-62 victory, 
advancing 
to 
a 
first-round 

matchup with No. 6 seed Notre 
Dame in Brooklyn on Friday.

“(Irvin’s) 
just 
got 
that 

mentality,” said junior guard 
Derrick Walton Jr. “No matter 
how many he’s missed, when the 
moment is big and the shot really 
matters, you can count on him to 
take and make that shot.”

Michigan led 28-20 at halftime 

thanks to a late offensive surge, 
but 
early 
second-half 
foul 

trouble — which left Walton on 
the bench for nearly six minutes 
— allowed Tulsa (20-12) to jump 
right back into the game.

After a rapid series of lead 

changes, it was the Wolverines 
who first showed signs of pulling 
away when redshirt sophomore 
Duncan 
Robinson 
knocked down 
a 3-pointer to 
put Michigan 
up 47-45. Irvin 
knocked down 
a 
mid-range 

jumper 
and 

sophomore 
guard 
Muhammad-
Ali 
Abdur-

Rahkman hit a pair of free 
throws to stretch the lead to 
six with 7:38 to play. But the 
Golden Hurricane refused to 
go down, continuing to attack 
the rim with layup after layup 

and ultimately retaking the lead 
with 4:24 to play.

The two teams played within 

three points of each other right 
up until Irvin finally delivered 
the dagger, and he and Walton 
helped the Wolverines pull away 
at the charity stripe for another 
nail-biting win — their third in a 
week.

“We haven’t had too many 

close games (this year),” Irvin 
said. “The Big Ten Tournament 
definitely helped us out. We’re 
able to finish close games. We 
know we’ve gotta be able to do 
that in the NCAA Tournament — 
survive and advance.”

Irvin and Abdur-Rahkman 

each had a game-high 16 points, 
with Abdur-Rahkman adding a 
big shot of his own — a banked 
jump shot with just under four 
minutes to play that Michigan 
coach John Beilein called a “nine 
out of 10” degree of difficulty.

Robinson, 
meanwhile, 

attempted to shed his reputation 
as a pure shooter by playing one 

of his best all-
around games 
of 
the 
year, 

finishing with 
13 points, 11 
rebounds and 
four assists.

“If 

somebody 
told me he’d 
get a double-
double, I could 
see 10 threes in 

game — I wouldn’t have believed 
11 rebounds,” Beilein said. “He’s 
just learning the game, the 
college game (is) played against 
really good players.”

The 
second-half 
scoring 

frenzy stood in stark contrast 
to the first half, in which both 
teams fell victim to lengthy 
scoring droughts.

Robinson started off the game 

with a 3-pointer and freshman 
forward Moritz Wagner sparked 
the Wolverines early with a 
dunk, two rebounds, a block and 
a steal in his first minute on the 
court.

But 
Michigan’s 
shooting 

quickly 
went 
cold. 
The 

Wolverines started the game 
3-for-16 from the floor and 1-for-
9 from three, falling into a 6:13 
scoring drought that allowed the 
Golden Hurricane to take a 16-9 
lead midway through the half.

But Irvin knocked down a 

triple to snap Michigan out of its 
funk, and Tulsa embarked on a 
6:36 scoreless stretch of its own. 
Walton — who struggled with his 
shot in the Big Ten Tournament 
and most of the first half of the 
game Wednesday — also sprang 
to life with 10 points in the 
final four minutes of the half, 
including two 3-pointers.

It was the same story in 

the second half for Irvin and 
Walton, who woke up in the nick 
of time to keep the Wolverines’ 
tournament run alive.

Wagner’s big night 
comes at the right 
time for Michigan

By KELLY HALL 

Daily Sports Editor

DAYTON, Ohio — With 22 

seconds left and a First Four 
victory securely locked in place, 
Moritz 
Wagner 
exited 
the 

hardwood at University of Dayton 
Arena and lifted his arms. All 
night, the freshman forward 
pumped up his teammates and 
the crowd on Michigan’s way to a 
67-62 victory over Tulsa (20-12).

His 
exuberance 
wasn’t 

unwarranted.

Wagner played 22 minutes on 

his way to eight rebounds, four 
blocks and four points — all of 
which came off of slam dunks. 
He had just two blocks all season 
until Wednesday night, when he 
doubled his season total.

“Yeah, Mo’s an energy guy,” said 

sophomore guard Muhammad-
Ali Abdur-Rahkman. “Even when 
he’s not on the court, he’s trying 
to lift us up when we’re down and 
things like that. So it’s great to see 
him out there, being energized 
and play well.”

After shooting 3-for-3 for nine 

points against Indiana in the 
Big Ten Tournament, during his 
first substantive minutes since 
December, Wagner has seen the 
floor more often, and for good 
reason. 

Though Wagner’s help came 

on the offensive end against the 
Hoosiers, his help in the First 
Four came on the defensive. 

During Michigan’s 6:13 scoring 

drought in the first half, which 
resulted in a Golden Hurricane 

8-0 run, Wagner prevented Tulsa 
from wreaking more havoc on 
the Wolverines (23-12) with his 
well-timed blocks — one of which 
came within his first minute on 
the court. 

In the second half, Wagner 

blocked 
6-foot-9 
forward 

Brandon Swannegan, trapping 
the ball against the backboard. 
Wagner proved to be the best 
option against Swannegan, an 
important role to have in a game 
where Tulsa scored 38 of its 62 
points in the paint. 

Though 
he 
did 
most 
of 

his damage on the defensive 
end, Wagner’s few offensive 
performances 
were 
ones 
to 

remember. Sixteen seconds after 
being subbed into the game, 
Wagner stole the ball. Redshirt 
sophomore Duncan Robinson 
missed his 3-point attempt on the 
possession, but Wagner followed 
up with an offensive rebound. 
Seconds later, Robinson threw 
the ball to Wagner so he could 
jam it into the net for a two-
handed slam to give Michigan a 
9-8 lead. 

Later, Wagner had the ball just 

beyond the arc and momentarily 
thought about shooting it, but 
he decided to take a few long 
strides to get beneath the net 
after seeing Abdur-Rahkman in 
the corner. He dished it to the 
sophomore guard, who drove for 
a layup. 

Of course, Wagner’s most-

memorable play came when the 
two teams were trading buckets 
as the clock ticked down. After 
a Robinson layup put Michigan 
back up by one point with 2:49 
remaining, 
the 
Wolverines 

needed to capitalize on the next 
possession, and they did. Wagner 
grabbed 
an 
offensive 
board 

after Abdur-Rahkman missed a 
jumper, and he dumped it into the 
net to give Michigan 59-56 lead. 

Following 
his 
dunk 
and 

the late-game scare, Wagner 
turned to the crowd for help and 
encouragement.

“When you tell me that right 

now, I feel a little embarrassed,” 
Wagner 
said 
of 
his 
loud 

engagement with the crowd. 
“That’s just me. I can’t help it, I’m 
just doing it. It’s fun. It’s great. It’s 
just me.”

Fouling has been a problem 

of Wagner’s, but he didn’t foul at 
all in the first half. He collected 
his first almost 10 minutes into 
the 
second. 
Twenty 
seconds 

later, he fouled again and was 
consequently subbed out. Though 
his fouls didn’t prevent him from 
seeing the court, it was obvious 
that he was concerned about 
fouling. 

 Just over eight minutes into 

the first half, Wagner stared 
down the referee nearest to him, 
nervously clenching his teeth. It 
was almost as if he was afraid that 
his second block of the game was 
going to be called a foul, and that 
he would end up on the bench like 
he had in too many of his previous 
games.

But it was called for what it was 

— the freshman’s second block 
of the game — and the big man 
stayed in. The rest is history, and 
now the Wolverines are on their 
way to Brooklyn to take on No. 
6 seed Notre Dame in the first 
round of the NCAA Tournament. 

“Mo has been huge for us,” 

said junior guard Zak Irvin. “He’s 
definitely a spark plug off the 
bench. It all started in the Big Ten 
Tournament. He was a big asset 
tonight. He’s gotta keep that going 
into Notre Dame.”

SHORT FILM REVIEW

In his Oscar-nominated 

short film “Ave Maria,” 
director Basil 
Khalil finds 
room for 
humor in a 
exploration 
of the Israeli-
Palestinian 
conflict. The 
short follows 
an Israeli family who, while 
racing home for Shabbat, 
crashes their car into a statue 
of the Virgin Mary outside 
a convent. The family must 
enlist the help of the convent’s 
nuns despite their initial 
reservations.

“Ave Maria” doesn’t take 

itself or its subject matter too 
seriously, and it’s wonderful. 
The rule-driven lifestyles of 
both the Jewish family and 
the Christian nuns are tackled 
with humorous reverence. 
One scene, in which a man 
has to ask a mute nun to dial 
the phone for him and hold it 
to his ear because he cannot 

operate machinery on the 
Sabbath, showcases the film’s 
delicate humor. Likewise, the 
final shot — the family driving 
home in a Palestinian car with 
a neon Virgin Mary strapped 
to the roof — is ridiculous yet 
heartwarming. 

“Ave Maria” sets high 

expectations for a 15 minute-
long film, but it doesn’t quite hit 
the mark. It wants to achieve 
so much — social commentary, 
satire, humor, heart — that it 
doesn’t allow itself to breath. 

At times, it feels like Khalil is 
checking things off a bucket 
list, moving from a scene that 
screams “humor!” to a scene 
that screams “heart!” without 
allowing his scenes time to be 
both.

Still, “Ave Maria” is 

beautifully shot and 
charmingly funny. The film is 
full of hope, and the belief that 
deep down (sometimes really 
deep down) people are innately 
good.

“In Ann Arbor, they call it the 

Big House,” an actress says. Add-
ing a regional twist, she provokes 
a flood of 
laughter.

They’ll 

call it a 
cooch, 
snatch, box, 
hoo-ha, lady 
bits, muff, 
biscuit, 
pudendum, 
tuna town 
and honey 
pot, among 
others. Yet although approxi-
mately 50 percent of the world 
has one, it’s edited out of every-
thing from polite conversation to 
Supreme Court debates.

“The Vagina Monologues,” 

written by Eve Ensler, was first 
performed in 1996. Ensler inter-
viewed various women about 
their relationships with their 
vaginas and compiled the inter-
views into a project that seeks to 
explore the taboo subject.

Students for Choice will pres-

ent its fourth annual production 
of “The Vagina Monologues,” 
featuring Ensler’s original work, 
with some adaptation and addi-
tions including a preface of origi-
nal student-written monologues, 
on their own personal experi-
ences pertaining to the topic. 

Rachel Beglin, an LSA sopho-

more cast member, said she 
thought the show helped open 
up healthier dialogue about sex 
education.

“I grew up in Arizona with 

abstinence-only sex education 
and wondered why didn’t my 
mom teach me this? Why didn’t a 
teacher teach me this? Why didn’t 
anyone give me a link, a pam-
phlet, anything?” Beglin said.

LSA senior Lizzie Stewart 

wrote her own monologue about 
her experience as a queer woman.

“My monologue is about the 

effect that an unwanted sexual 
act had on my sexual identity and 
my process of figuring out what 

that is, and I think it’s important 
for people to know that it’s okay 
to not know,” she said.

“The Vagina Monologues” has 

faced criticism in the past for its 
lack of inclusivity and represen-
tation of both non-heterosexual 
women and women of color.

LSA senior Irene Syriac plays 

an asexual character in a mono-
logue written by a close friend of 
hers who is asexual.

“My character says in the 

monologue, ‘You never see 
asexual characters anywhere,’ so 
I think it’s good exposure,” Syriac 
said.

“If I want the audience to get 

anything out of this, it’s a remind-
er that the word ‘vagina’ is not a 
swear word.”

Although many of the mono-

logues focus on discovery of 
peace with one’s body or a kind of 
awakening, not all of the stories 
are so hopeful or enlightening. 
For instance, Music, Theatre 
& Dance sophomore Mackenzi 
Anthony’s monologue touches 
on violence toward transgender 
women.

“My story is not so much about 

acceptance. I talk about how they 
killed my boyfriend for dating a 
transgender woman, and that’s 
intense,” she said.

The women working on the 

show have engaged in self-reflec-
tion and personal storytelling to 
more accurately understand the 
show’s strength. The secrecy and 
shamefulness associated with the 
experience of having a vagina can 
be alienating and overwhelming.

“Seeing ‘The Vagina Mono-

logues’ for the first time I 
thought, ‘Oh my god, everyone 
else is just as confused as I am! 
Everyone is just as angry and 
worried and scared as I am’ and 
I’m just like, ‘Why do we have to 
feel this way about our genitalia?’ 
” Anthony said.

Director and LSA junior 

Angelle Antoun hopes that “The 
Vagina Monologues” will open 
up the floor for further discus-
sion about feminism and diversity 
through its candid and multifac-
eted approach. Antoun acted in 
“The Vagina Monologues” last 

year and understands the need to 
appeal to a diverse audience. 

“That’s been the issue I came 

in expecting, and it has been a 
challenge and something that 
I’ve been working very hard to 
ameliorate about the show so 
that it can speak to a number of 
women,” Antoun said.

In preparation, the women 

shared their own stories about 
their experiences of overcoming 
obstacles in their womanhood.

“We thought it really brought 

us closer as a cast, not only 
because we knew those things 
about each other, but because 
sharing those sorts of stories can 
be very difficult,” Antoun said. 
“Having those other women 
giving nothing but respect and 
support to the other women there 
was a really wonderful feeling.”

Antoun also said the group 

wanted to perform a show that 
will engage the community 
beyond women.

“These are not issues that 

women talk about in day-to-day 
life (openly) … when you go to 
shows like this there’s this fear 
that it’s going to be man-hating 
and angry feminism and this 
show isn’t that at all. I think that 
men that go to it will come away 
with the idea that yes, feminists 
can be angry, but not so much at 
men as at the system and come 
away with it more willing to be 
part of the fight,” she said.

In addition to opening dia-

logue about experiences that are 
usually pushed aside, “The Vagi-
na Monologues” seeks to support 
movements to reduce sexual vio-
lence against women. All of the 
proceeds will be donated to the 
SafeHouse Center and the V-Day 
campaign. There will be a talk-
back panel to debrief and further 
explore the implications of the 
show on the following Monday at 
8 p.m. in the Earl Lewis Room in 
Rackham Auditorium.

“The Vagina Monologues” will 

moan, bleed, cry, argue, joke and 
ponder with the intention of let-
ting you know that the women 
brave enough to share their sto-
ries have no plans of shutting up 
any time soon. 

‘Monologues’ break 
taboos at Rackham

COMMUNITY CULTURE PREVIEW

By DANIELLE YACOBSON

Daily Arts Writer

Our story begins in London 

circa 
1871, 
when 
contempo-

rary fashions of lung-restricting 
corsets deemed breathing for 
the weak, and bustles plumped 
up even the most conservative 
behinds. Artist James McNeill 
Whistler, hired by a wealthy Eng-
lishman who was tickled by every-
thing porcelain, transformed the 
Englishman’s ceramic-filled liv-
ing room into an aesthetic master-
piece. Gold peacocks danced on 
Parisian blue walls in what came 
to be known as “Harmony in Blue 
and Gold: The Peacock Room.”

In 1904, American art connois-

seur Charles Lang Freer bought 
the room and installed the paint-
ings in his Detroit home. After his 
death, the gold and blue murals 
were taken to the Freer Gallery 
in Washington D.C., but many 
still consider the room a Detroit 
historical landmark. Today, a new 
Peacock Room, a women’s bou-
tique, can be found in what used 
to be the living room of a 1920s 
luxury hotel, embodying the 
glamour of the original space and 
Whistler’s art, all with a spunky 
twist that Detroiters exemplify oh 
so well.

“When you think of a peacock, 

you think of showing off,” founder 
and storeowner Rachel Lutz said. 
“You think of pride, and that’s 
what I want women to feel in my 
store.”

Carrying sizes 00 through 

26, the boutique features styles 
to dress everybody, carrying 
a diverse range of silhouettes, 
forms and proportions so that no 
woman is left behind.

“Just because you see some-

thing in a fashion magazine 
doesn’t mean it would necessar-
ily translate to your body,” Lutz 

said. “We don’t go after a specific 
demographic. We just go after 
women who want to feel great 
about themselves and want to 
express their style. We’ve had 
three generations of women come 
in at the same time and each walk 
out with a dress.”

The Peacock Room stands out 

by abandoning traditional brand 
labels and focusing on design and 
good fit instead. It’s the place to 
spice up any wardrobe, perhaps 
with something a bit riskier that 
flatters both the body and spirit.

“The only real criteria I have 

when finding my finds is asking, 
‘What would get you a compliment 
from a stranger?’ ” Lutz said. “We 
really try to de-emphasize labels 
and boxes on people. Instead, we 
try to emphasize unique finds.”

The store’s treasures include 

their 
vintage 
pieces, 
which 

make up about 10 percent of the 
merchandise. 
They’ve 
carried 

everything from micro-beaded 
handbags well over 100 years old 
to jewelry lines made from antique 
French molds.

“I love the thrill of the hunt,” 

Lutz said. “We take pride in the 
fact that you never quite know 
what to expect when you walk in, 
so maybe your best finds are here, 
and you just don’t know it yet.”

For many, shopping victories in 

large department stores come few 
and far between. Instead, trips 
are fruitless pursuits that leave 
fashion-hopefuls discouraged and 
underwhelmed. Even Lutz, who 
owns a successful and flourishing 
boutique, dislikes shopping and 
the fashion industry.

“Shopping has gotten all the 

pleasure out of it,” she said. 
“Instead of going into a nice bou-
tique, we push grocery carts down 
fluorescent-lit aisles and there’s 
no one to serve you.”

This frustration is left out of 

The Peacock Room equation, 
where the emphasis is placed on 
providing a personable shopping 
experience that doesn’t adhere 
to the parameters established by 
designers or merchandisers.

“Style is the expression of your-

self, and fashion is merely the 
renewal of that process,” Lutz said. 
“It doesn’t have to come from a 
runway or a magazine, so take con-
trol of your own style.”

A scarf doesn’t have to be a 

scarf; it can be a head wrap, a table 
runner, a beach towel. The possi-
bilities, Lutz says, are endless, as 
long as you see the garment how 
you want to wear it and not how 
someone else wants you to wear it. 

“Detroiters, by nature, are risk-

takers,” she said. “I think that 
translates into our style. You see 
women that are more willing to 
experiment with color and tex-
ture, who aren’t wearing what 
someone told them to wear but 
making it their own.”

Ultimately, The Peacock Room 

seeks to instill confidence in the 
shoppers who visit their store. 
Women have bought dresses for 
first dates with men who became 
their husbands, and for opera per-
formances that colored a defining 
moment in their career. Each time, 
The Peacock Room played a part in 
creating that special experience.

“A woman came in the day of 

her mother’s funeral and I was 
really touched that on such a pow-
erful and hard day in her life, she 
found my store as her sanctuary,” 
Lutz said. “It was a really hum-
bling compliment.”

A trip to The Peacock Room 

is more than an average session 
of retail therapy. It’s emotional 
cleansing, confidence building and 
a reminder that there is no mold 
for beauty.

“It’s not just a store, it’s a confes-

sional,” Lutz said.

Detroit has long been wiped 

of many of its historical, boom-
era anachronisms. Generations 
have come and gone, and with 
them, legendary sites and rel-
ics of Detroit’s record industrial 
growth and world status in the 
20th century have left without 
a trace. Among them, Detroit’s 
legendary J.L. Hudson Compa-
ny had an especially important 
place in Detroit’s history, helping 
foster much of the city’s former 
glory.

The 
Hudson’s 
department 

store (formerly on the streets of 
Woodward and Gratiot) stood 
at a towering 29 stories. For the 
majority of its existence, it was 
the tallest retail space in the 
world, and for the entirety of 
its existence it was the second-
largest department store in the 
United States by square footage 
— only bested by Macy’s Her-
ald Square in New York City. At 
its peak in the late ’50s to early 
’60s, it boasted 12,000 employees 
and 100,000 customers coming 
through its doors every day. Hud-
son’s was a cultural behemoth at 
a time when the United States 
was experiencing vast societal 
transformations. As important as 
it was for Detroit, it was equally 
important 
for 
merchandising 

and fashion for all of the United 
States.

“You could go to Hudson’s and 

get everything on your shopping 
list,” Sally Gell, former Detroit 
resident and Hudson’s shopper, 
said. “It had everything imag-
inable.” Gell used to frequent 
Hudson’s during the store’s peak, 
recounting how it was the quint-
essential destination for all types 
of goods. The store was often 
peddling up to 600,000 items 
from 16,000 different vendors 
from across the globe.

Humble Beginnings
Born in England, but a product 

of years in Ontario and Michi-
gan, Joseph Lowthian Hudson 
and his family lived a meager 
lifestyle, putting bread on their 
table by selling personally craft-
ed clothes wherever they lived. 
While living in Michigan, Hud-
son quickly became a helping 
hand in his father’s small cloth-
ing shop in the town of Ionia, 
Mich., learning the textile trade 
while helping run his father’s 
enterprise. However, what was 
a stable stream of work for his 
family came to an abrupt halt 
after the Panic of 1873 plagued 
much of the country. With shut-
tered textile mills and a dearth 
of customers, Hudson was thrust 
out of the business and forced to 
declare bankruptcy. His father 
died soon after.

In a bout of ambition, Hudson 

brushed himself off and trans-
planted his family from Ionia to 
the then bustling city of Detroit. 
With what small funds and sup-
porting creditors he had behind 

him, he established a store-
front in the old Detroit Opera 
House — the humble precursor 
to Hudson’s vast department 
store empire. Finding himself 
immediately successful thanks 
to Detroit’s meteoric growth, 
Hudson paid off the creditors 
from his previous bankruptcy 
and moved his store to a larger, 
grander location. After years of 
sustained success, what became 
the J.L. Hudson Company (col-
loquially “Hudson’s”) made its 
eventual move into the famous 
J.L. Hudson Building on Wood-
ward Avenue in 1946. It didn’t 
take long for Hudson’s to quickly 
embed itself in Detroit’s local 
culture, its name famously being 
synonymous 
with 
Christmas 

shopping and the latest in haute 
couture.

Making Its Name Known
On the back of his business’ 

success, J.L. Hudson quickly 
established himself as one of 
Detroit’s leading culture patrons. 
Hudson 
sponsored 
Detroit’s 

first Thanksgiving parade, pav-
ing way for Detroit’s long and 
beloved 
annual 
tradition 
of 

America’s Thanksgiving Parade, 
the second oldest parade of its 
kind (sharing that title with New 
York’s own Macy’s Thanksgiving 
Day Parade). Hudson’s fireworks 
display quickly became a part of 
every Detroit family’s Fourth of 
July celebration. Hudson opened 
up satellite storefronts and shop-
ping malls all across the Detroit 
metro area — Southfield’s loca-
tion being among the most note-
worthy for providing parking for 
10,500 cars and having 53 store-
fronts (including a Hudson’s 
location) — all the way back in 
1954. 

Detroit flourished in the early 

part of the 20th century, largely 
due to businesses like Hudson’s 
and their presence in the city.

Hudson’s was “more than just 

a department store … It was one 
of a kind,” Gell said. In addition 
to creating one of the most noto-
rious retailers in the country, 
Hudson leveraged his success 
toward Detroit’s own well-being. 
Arguably, Detroit reached its 
peak thanks in part to the contri-
butions of men like Hudson.

“Hudson’s was the place to 

work and shop in the 1950s,” 
Elsie Vasich, a former patron 
of the store and resident of 
the Detroit metropolitan area, 
said. Vasich’s sister was once 
employed at Hudson’s Detroit 
location. “Many women wanted 
jobs at department stores like 
Hudson’s, because the work and 
pay was quite good.”

Of the shopping experience, 

Gell said. “It was very comfort-
ing for anyone who wanted to 
shop there.”

Hudson’s 
embodied 
an 

approach toward shopping that 
has been long forgotten by U.S. 
retailers. On the graces of the 
experience, it crafted for its shop-
pers and employees alike, Hud-

son’s became the quintessential 
destination for elegance, class, 
reliability and service — acting as 
both a cultural and commercial 
cornerstone of Detroit during the 
height of its existence.

End of an Era
Stripped away for parts — 

such was largely the essence of 
Hudson’s’ demise. With the rapid 
growth of suburban communi-
ties in Metro Detroit in the ’70s 
and ’80s, Detroit’s population 
began dwindling. Those who 
were wealthy enough planted 
themselves in the various afflu-
ent communities on the outskirts 
of the city. Changing waves in 
Detroit’s demographics versus 
those of the outerlying sub-
urbs led to the eventual closure 
of Hudson’s flagship store in 
Detroit.

With the closure of its Detroit 

storefront came the disappear-
ance of Hudson’s fundamental 
identity. As time went on and the 
retail industry became saturated 
with extraordinarily successful 
nationwide enterprises, compa-
nies like Hudson’s couldn’t keep 
up with competitors and conced-
ed to closure and consolidation 
with larger corporations. After 
a series of corporate hand-offs, 
Hudson’s former Detroit store-
front was demolished in 1998; 
additionally, 
what 
eventually 

became Macy’s, Inc. gutted and 
swallowed what Hudson’s prop-
erty was left.

To some extent, Hudson’s fall 

from grace was cruel foreshad-
owing for what was to come for 
Detroit. People who once called 
Detroit home ended up fleeing 
at the slightest indications of 
trouble; Hudson’s felt as if it was 
only logical to follow suit. The 
domino effect of demographic 
shifts swept Hudson’s, along 
with everybody else, away from 
the city. As much as Hudson’s 
was a part of Detroit’s strength 
as a city, its end was also one of 
many symbols of the city’s even-
tual undoing.

It’s vital to remind ourselves 

of stories like Hudson’s. After 
being blighted with its fair share 
of misfortune, the grand stories 
and characters associated with 
Detroit’s glory are slowly dwin-
dling. Though Hudson’s had as 
unceremonious a send-off as a 
cultural staple could, the legacy 
of J.L. Hudson and his stores 
mustn’t go forgotten.

With recent rising tides in 

Detroit, remembering the indi-
viduals who made Detroit the 
city it once was, and the city it’s 
once again trying to become, is 
important. How fitting is it to 
revitalize a city without taking 
into account the culture and his-
tory that made the city as grand 
as it used to be? Is blanketing a 
city with a completely new iden-
tity the same thing as reviving it? 
No matter how you feel, reading 
the stories of individuals like J.L. 
Hudson is earnest fuel for the 
betterment of Detroit.

MTV’s ‘Real World’ 

looks for stars at 

Charley’s

By ALLIE TAYLOR

Daily Arts Writer

“Real World,” MTV’s longest-

running reality program, will be 
holding a casting call at Good Time 
Charley’s on South University 
Avenue from 10 
a.m. to 5 p.m. 
on 
Wednes-

day, 
Mar. 
23. 

Since 
1992, 

“Real 
World” 

showcases and 
exposes 
the 

reality of how 
people between 
the ages of 21 
and 25 interact 
with each other 
under 
intense, 

intimate 
cir-

cumstances. 
Each season, seven to eight people 
live together under one roof for 
three months, undergoing chal-
lenges, excursions and everyday 
experiences that assess the integ-
rity and personality of each person. 
The cast members begin as com-
plete strangers, often with extreme 
differences in beliefs, lifestyles, 
upbringings 
and 
personalities, 

creating an intense and intriguing 
environment. 

The show follows these people 

as they develop relationships with 
each other and evolve as people. 
Issues of sex, drugs, racism, par-
tying, love, pain and truth are 
brought forth, leaving cast mem-
bers challenged, confronted and 
vulnerable. Oftentimes, the cast 
members find themselves in situ-
ations that test everything they 
know to be true about themselves 
and about the world around them. 

Kailah Casillas, a cast member 

of the upcoming 31st season “Real 
World: Go Big or Go Home,” grew 
up watching the show. In an inter-
view with The Michigan Daily, 

Casillas said that being on the 
show was different from what she 
expected.

“It’s a lot harder,” Casillas said. 

“I had the time of my life. But you 
don’t realize how hard it is psy-
chologically, with all the cameras 
... being away from home, being 
in a new environment and having 
to be very tolerant of other people 
and their behaviors and lifestyles. 
These people are culturally totally 
different from me.”

Microphones and video camer-

as follow each cast member around 
24/7. 

“The only time we were allowed 

to take our microphone off was to 
shower and to sleep,” Casillas said. 
“We were filmed 24 hours a day 
and seven days a week.”

Reality TV shows are often 

scrutinized for not being an accu-
rate portrayal of real life, and 
questions arise regarding how 
authentic the “reality” part truly 
is. In “Real World,” however, the 
show seems to stay true to its name 
by refraining from interfering with 
each cast member’s life. The cast 
members are neither told what to 
do, nor given any kind of instruc-
tion on how to act.

“God, I wish it were staged,” 

Casillas said, when asked if any 
part of the show was orchestrated. 
“If it were staged, I would be able 
to blame all of my crazy antics on 
someone else. But, unfortunately, 
those are actually the things that 
I do.”

“We take pride in the fact that 

we don’t coach the cast members,” 
“Real World” casting director 
Themi Chahales said in a separate 
interview with the Daily. “We real-
ly let them bring their personalities 
to us.”

When casting, Chahales looks 

for characters: people with strong 
personalities who aren’t afraid to 
speak their minds, people from 
diverse backgrounds, people who 
are open and honest about their 
daily experiences, people with 
over-the-top 
personalities 
and 

people who are dynamic.

“People like to think we’re look-

ing for a certain type of person, but 
really, the characters come to us,” 
Chahales said. “There’s an endless 
amount of characters with an end-
less amount of stories. It’s not like 
some of those other reality shows 
that are really specific (with who 
they cast). There’s not a specific 
criteria for this show, and because 
of that, I think it allows the cast-
ing of people to be endless. There’s 
always 20-somethings that are fig-
uring out who they are.”

The show serves as a major 

learning experience for everyone 
involved. When diverse groups of 
people are confined together for 
three months, attitudes change 
and mindsets open up. By the 
end of the season, cast members 
become different people.

“I left a changed person because 

I saw what other people were going 
through,” Casillas said. “I saw that 
I need to be more open-minded. My 
beliefs were so questioned because 
everyone was so different from me. 
People have it much harder than 
I ever could have imagined. I left 
there 
completely 
mind-fucked. 

This experience made me think 
about everything I had ever been 
taught, and everything I ever 
believed in. I never had to think 
differently before this. When I got 
there, and lived with a kid who was 
pansexual, a girl who was from a 
really, really rough part of St. Louis 
and a girl who was adopted, I left 
there being like: ‘Wow, who am I?’ 
It really made me question all of my 
beliefs.”

To the people who are consider-

ing going to the casting call, Casil-
las said, “Do it. This is something 
you will never ever be able to expe-
rience anywhere else.” 

As for advice to people who 

want to be cast, both Chahales and 
Casillas emphasized the impor-
tance of being yourself. 

“You never know what these 

casting directors are looking for,” 
Casillas said. “Being open and hon-
est and being yourself is really the 
key to being on ‘Real World.’”

Saturday:
9 
a.m: 
Before 
you 
do 

anything, pick up some carrots 
and curios at Eastern Market, 
America’s oldest continuously 
running farmer’s market. Long 
before “local” was a buzzword, 
the market was one of several in 
the city, one in each direction: 
Northern, Southern, Eastern 
and Western. Be sure to try 
some local coffee to kickstart 
a busy day, and perhaps some 
flowers, 
particularly 
if 
it’s 

around Flower Day on May 20, 
one of the biggest flower shows 
in the country.

11 a.m: Drop off your bags at 

The Inn on Ferry Street. With 
a prime location in Midtown on, 
you guessed it, Ferry Street, the 
historic hotel’s four renovated 
Victorian homes ooze with old 
world charm. In spring, the 
inn gives you a perfect vantage 
point to enjoy the blooming 
green spaces scattered around 
the urban jungle.

12 p.m: Head down the 

street to a delicious lunch at 
Maccabees at Midtown, a 
perennial 
favorite 
bursting 

with Detroiters and out-of-
towners alike. If you can wind 
your way through the light rail 
construction on Woodward to 
find it, you’ll discover one of 
Detroit architecture’s best kept 
secrets: the Maccabee building, 
an Art Deco treasure built 
by the Jewish organization 
Knights of the Maccabees in 
the 1920s.

2 
p.m: 
Pop 
across 
the 

street to spend the afternoon 
exploring the city’s art scene 
from 
yesterday 
and 
today. 

The 
Detroit 
Institute 
of 

Arts is the legendary home 
of Picassos, Van Goghs, the 
famous Rivera mural and one of 
the finest collections of African 
American contemporary art in 
the country. Be sure to check 
out the spring exhibition of 

art from kids throughout the 
Detroit Public Schools, featured 
until Jun. 12. Then head down 
Woodward a few blocks to 
the 
more 
unconventional 

Museum of Contemporary 
Art Detroit, featuring avant 
garde works from around the 
world, including the fantastic 
Detroit Affinities photography 
series on display until April 
24. Finally, catch the end of the 
Detroit Historical Museum’s 
exhibition 
Fashion 
D.Fined, 

a look into the city’s lesser 
known, but still significant 
contributions to the world of 
fashion.

6 
p.m: 
Exhausted 
from 

a 
day 
wandering 
among 

masterpieces? 
There’s 
no 

better place to unwind than the 
Whitney Mansion. A historic 
1890s home built with the 
city’s pre-industrial riches, the 
Whitney is now one of Detroit’s 
foremost restaurants. Expect a 
classy atmosphere, top-notch 
food and a seat in the mansion’s 
exquisite interior, or even the 
beautiful gardens if the night is 
warm. If you’re in a slightly less 
classy mood after dinner, you 
can hit Midtown’s newfound 
nightlife 
down 
the 
street, 

including the beloved Cafe 
D’Mongo’s.

Sunday:
10 a.m: Before you check out 

of the inn, scurry down the 
street to a mysterious little 
stone building called the Scarab 
Club. Tucked away in the 
Museum District, this discreet, 
historic building is still home 
to the city’s oldest association 
of artists. With tours of its art 
collection as well as painting 
and sketching classes, the club 
has produced some of the area’s 
most prominent artists.

11 a.m: Then head over to Cliff 

Bell’s famous jazzy brunch 
downtown. One of Detroit’s 
legendary jazz clubs, at night 
Cliff Bell’s is full of speakeasy 
charm. 
But 
every 
Sunday, 

their brunch, accompanied by 

famous jazz musicians, is just 
as popular in town.

1 p.m: While Detroit may 

be better known for its urban 
grit and downtown hipsters 
than it is for natural beauty, 
there’s plenty to be found along 
the Detroit Riverfront, the 
gorgeous public walkway along 
the river that will eventually 
connect large swaths of the 
city. If you stroll along it 
long 
enough, 
you’ll 
come 

across plenty of landmarks, 
from the Joe Louis Fist, the 
famous statue on West Grand 
Boulevard 
commemorating 

the local boxing hero, to the 
Underground 
Railroad 

Monument, a stirring tribute 
to the city’s role as the end of 
the 
Underground 
Railroad, 

which 
then 
transported 

escaped slaves across the river 
to freedom in Canada. If you 
continue even further, you’ll 
pass the Renaissance Center, 
headquarters 
to 
General 

Motors, and you can even stop 
by Belle Isle, the beloved park 
in the middle of the river that 
was designed by Frederick Law 
Olmstead, the same famous 
designer who created Central 
Park.

5 p.m: You’ve had quite 

the afternoon. Before leaving 
town, head down the freeway 
to 
Southwest 
Detroit. 
At 

Mexicantown Bakery, you can 
pick up some churros, tres leches 
and other traditional sweets for 
the road. Just down the street 
go to Lupita’s Taquería, a 
favorite among everyone from 
locals to Canadians visiting 
from over the border, for a 
phenomenal bowl of pozole or 
some top notch tacos. Finally, 
grab a coffee or dessert a 
few blocks over at Café con 
Leche or its ice cream-themed 
neighbor La Michoacana. It’s 
time to go, but now that you’ve 
had a taste of what the city has 
to offer, you’ll be back soon 
enough.

H

ow does a musical 
gain a following? 
How does it keep it?

On the surface, there’s really 

nothing 
relatable 
about 
a 

musical. 
People 
rarely just 
break out 
into song 
and dance 
about 
some-
thing 
they’re 
thinking or talking about. It’s 
not realistic. Yet so many musi-
cals have gained our support.

Why in the world do we love 

them so much?

I went over to Google to 

do a little research on which 
musicals were considered the 
best of Broadway. I realized 
quickly that a lot of Google sites 
claim to know the top ten best 
musicals — and they all list a 
different top ten. I decided 
instead to look at the longest 
running musicals. Here they 
are, according to Wikipedia: 
“The Phantom Of the Opera,” 
“Chicago,” “The Lion King,” 
“Cats,” 
“Les 
Misérables,” 

“A Chorus Line,” “Mamma 
Mia,” “Beauty and the Beast,” 
“Wicked” 
and 
“Rent.” 
All 

of these productions get at 
something that we want in a 
musical. Here is a breakdown 
of the major components these 
musicals are built upon:

The first: the story. Though 

people often want a story that 
is relatable to their own lives, 
interest towards a musical isn’t 
usually lost if the relatability 
is. “The Lion King” does not 
directly correlate to events that 
take place in our daily lives, 
and it doesn’t have to. We love 
it, and frankly, that’s enough. A 
story of love, of growing up, of 

finding one’s place in the world 
— these are aspects of a musical 
that produce an audience’s 
devotion. All of these musicals 
in 
some 
way 
or 
another 

comment on the parts of a story 
that make us want more.

The second: the music. Since 

the musical scores within all 
these shows are all different 
and unique, there isn’t one 
universal component that I can 
say leads to a musical’s success. 
The songs become popular 
and loved when people start to 
attach real emotions to them. 
There is something in the lyrics 
and music that has to hook an 
audience and for these “longest 
running musicals,” people have 
stayed hooked for years.

The third: the cast. The 

original cast of a musical is 
often credited with a huge 
portion of why a musical is so 
successful. And that makes 
sense. 
The 
relationships 

between characters and the 
emotions 
behind 
them 
are 

brought out through the cast. If 
people see those relationships 
and characters as genuine, they 
naturally “root” for them. Thus, 
the musical gains a following.

The question at the heart of 

any musical is this: why should 
we care? When these musicals 
answer that question, people 
remain loyal. The heart of the 
story, the music, the people — 
it has to get us to a place where 
we care. We need something 
that speaks to the truth of 
what is in our world today. We 

crave that from entertainment. 
If people watch a musical 
that is upbeat and lively, they 
might react saying, “yeah, that 
was fun.” Or reversely, with a 
drama, “that was sad.” We need 
something 
more, 
something 

gained or something learned. I 
think the musicals listed above 
get us there.

Modern controversy behind 

popular musicals on Broadway 
today comes from a worry 
that many popular musicals 
are only successful because 
they are tied to a well-known 
film, book or character, which 
has 
“commercialized” 
the 

Broadway stage. These debates 
make it difficult to distinguish 
if there are specific elements 
that make a musical successful 
or if it is simply a result of the 
audience’s recognition of a 
familiar story, with praise that 
follows when it’s brought to the 
stage.

I 
think 
by 
dwelling 
on 

concerns like these, we lose 
what 
makes 
a 
musical 
so 

magical. The reason that these 
musicals have gained support 
and praise is because a story 
(whether it comes from a book 
or movie or not), a musical score 
and a talented cast have come 
together and brought these 
elements to life. The audience is 
captivated by what they see in 
front of them, and they’re taken 
to a different place — a different 
world. They leave the show in 
awe of what they witnessed and 
eager for more.

If a musical has produced 

reactions like these, it deserves 
a following.

We need

What do you get when you give 

a weapons developer, a street art-
ist and a derivatives trader a stage 
name? Art.

Meet Autograf, three artists in 

their own right who turned loft 
party DJing into the career path 
of their dreams. Jake Carpenter, 
Louis Kha and Mikul Wing com-
prise a Chicago-based DJ/pro-
ducer/artist trio, currently taking 
the dance music scene by a tropical 
house storm. After catching them 
at a festival over New Year’s, I got 
a chance to see them again when 
they stopped at Populux as part of 
their three-month Metaphysical 
tour, which will culminate in New 
Orleans at the Buku Music + Art 
Project.

Maybe it’s because I’m writing 

this on a beach listening to Dream 
(thank you, indulgent affordanc-
es of college lifestyle and Spring 
Break), but thinking back on last 
Saturday gives the feeling of sway-
ing in a hammock to the beat of 
twinkly piano lines. Though their 
style is certainly more laid back 
than some other electronic art-
ists, the show still buzzed with 

energy and excitement. I can tell 
you from personal experience 
that it’s not quite fit for a booze 
cruise, but that’s OK. The boys of 
Autograf aren’t exactly going for 
the debauchery of an all-you-can-
drink vibe.

Though they all have differ-

ent artistic and educational back-
grounds, 
the 
music 
certainly 

comes together nicely. Wing, the 
street artist (who unfortunately, 
was absent due to a bad case of 
strep throat) had a few galleries in 
Chicago, and Kha the derivatives 
trader, studied economics at the 
University of Virginia in Arlington. 
Carpenter, who went to Colum-
bus College of Art and Design for 
metal sculpture, worked for the 
Department of Defense as weap-
ons developer, also doing research 
and development and underwater 
robotics.

The fact that all three were indi-

vidually involved with music made 
coming together as Autograf natu-
ral.

“My mom made me take piano 

lessons for ten years,” Carpenter 
said of the start of his music edu-
cation. “I did drum lessons for five 
years. In high school I played in the 
jazz band and marching band, but 

I didn’t do any art until the end of 
high school/start of college. It was 
just recently that I started doing 
art again with music.”

Kha, on the other hand, picked 

up music as a hobby and assumes 
he would still be in economics had 
production not taken over.

“I feel like most people are put 

on a path at an early age, a lot of 
times they kinda stay on that path,” 
he said. “For me, I jumped around 
… a lot of people have idealistic 
dreams when they’re young and if 
you don’t pursue it, a lot of times 
you forget about it. I was just for-
tunate enough to pursue it and be 
successful with it.”

That idealistic dream has taken 

shape in the form of a thriving 
endeavor to create music and per-
form live. Detroit was treated to 
a gorgeous set — complete with 
Carpenter on drums — that had 
Populux holding on to every note. 
From start to finish, whether play-
ing their most well-known hits like 
“Dream” and “Metaphysical,” or 
spinning out some nuanced noises 
that can’t quite be categorized, we 
were in it. Based on what I’ve seen 
and heard, it appears fans of the 
trio can only continue to grow in 
dedication and numbers.

SINGLE REVIEW

Weddings are often viewed 

as a joyous celebration of eternal 
monogamy, but for British singer 
Natasha 
Khan (aka 
Bat for 
Lashes) 
they can be 
extremely 
harrowing. 
This duality 
imbued 
within marriage acts as the 
emotional core of her new song 
“In God’s House” from her 
upcoming concept album, The 
Bride. From just one listen, you 
can hear Khan agonizing with 
fear as she waits for her groom 
to get to the church, only to 
discover that he will never show 
up.

A bewitching, mystical synth-

pop track, “In God’s House” is 
one of Khan’s most ambitious 
and emotionally stirring works 
to date. Its ethereal synths 
glisten and propel Khan’s 
masterful, vulnerable vocals, 
which swing effortlessly from 
a gentle whisper to a shrieking 
cry. “Through this veil they 
can’t see / The fog of death 
unveil me,” Khan sings woefully, 
almost as if the world is slowly 
closing on her. But the most 
heartbreaking moment comes 
when Khan realizes that her 
lover has been killed by a fire, 
repeating the word “fire” until 
she can no longer catch her 
breath.

In a sense, “In God’s House” 

is a tonally opposite counterpart 
to last month’s single “I Do,” 
which offers a much more 

light-hearted narrative on 
Khan’s hapless bride through 
a swooping harp instrumental 
and lyrics that reflect her giddy 
optimism on her wedding day. 
Both songs are like two sides of 
the same playing card: “I Do” 
saw Khan ruminating anxiously 
and excitedly over nuptial 
commitment, whereas “In God’s 
House” found her searching 
for answers on the verge of 
an emotional breakdown. 
Entrenched within the nuances 
of marriage, Khan understands 
that where there’s happiness, 
there’s also darkness. If “I Do” 
is the sweet, rosy prologue to a 
wedding, then “In God’s House” 
is the nightmarish climax 
with an uneasy, ambiguous 
resolution.

For the Daily

I can only imagine what the 

conversation 
between 
Kanye 

West and 19-year-old rapper 
Desiigner sounded like where 
Kanye told Desiigner he was 
sampling Desiigner’s viral hit, 
“Panda,” on The Life of Pablo. 
’Ye also signed Desiigner to his 
record label GOOD Music — an 
impressive endorsement and a 
sign that Desiigner is here to stay, 
at least for a little while. However, 
before we throw Desiigner into 
the growing pool of innovative 
new-school rappers, it’s important 
to take a long look at his musical 
roots.

Probably the most quotable 

line in “Panda” is the first one. 
Desiigner raps, “I got broads in 
Atlanta / Twisting dope, lean, and 
the Fanta.” Desiigner references 
Atlanta in his lyric, but more 
palpable is the iconic Atlanta 
sound Desiigner emulates. He 
raps with timely Young Thug-
esque adlibs sprinkled in and a 
low, almost apathetic, drawl that 
is so much more Future’s than it 
is Desiigner’s. (Desiigner’s sound 
is so similar to that of Future’s 
that when Desiigner’s chorus 
comes onto Kanye’s “Freestyle 4,” 
even after the hundredth listen I 
can’t help but think, “Are we sure 
that isn’t Future?”). The bitter 
irony, and maybe a microcosm of 
Desiigner’s problem, is that he has 

never been to Atlanta. The rapper 
so easily compared to Atlanta’s 
heaviest rap hitters has lived his 
entire life in Bed Stuy Brooklyn (A 
neighborhood graced with its own 
set of rap legacies).

Rap music has always tiptoed 

the fine line between inspiration 
and theft. (Just throw on Guerilla 
Black’s “Compton,” close your eyes 
and try to convince yourself you’re 
not listening to an unreleased 
Biggie track.) But Desiigner seems 
like an extreme example. “Panda” 
sounds like a focus group tested 
version of a Future mixtape track. 
“Future, mumble a little less, let’s 
make the snare clap a little harder, 
and while we’re at it, MORE 
ADLIBS.” Regardless, “Panda” 
is a great song. It’s Future, subtly 
contorted and twisted for a more 
pleasing pop sound. It replaces 
the doldrums of codeine addiction 
and 
depression 
with 
simple 

lyrics about cars and money (and 
pandas). It’s also plagiarism.

A few years ago Drake was 

forced to pay rapper Rappin’ 4 
Tay $100,000 for stealing the Bay 
Area legend’s verse, tinkering 
with it slightly and putting it on 
YG’s “Who Do You Love.” Rappin’ 
4 Tay rapped “I got a ho named 
Reel-to Reel. She got a buddy 
named SP 12, now you know the 
deal. We gets freaky in the studio 
late night, that’s why the beats that 
you hear coming real tight.” While 
a red-handed Drizzy rapped “I got 
a shorty name Texas Syn. She got 

a buddy named Young JB and now 
you know the deal. We turnt up in 
the studio late night. That’s why 
the songs that you hear are comin’ 
real tight.” That is, and will always 
be, plagiarism.

How different is Rappin’ 4 

Tay’s case compared to Future’s 
though? Sure, I can’t as plainly 
put in words the plagiarism of 
Desiigner’s work, but listen to any 
Future song and any Desiigner 
song and the similarities are 
undeniable. What makes a lyric 
any more integral to the song than 
the tone or the style? Why can 
anybody and their mother hop on 
a Metro Boomin’ beat and mumble 
like Future, but if they steal a lyric 
they’re a hack?

There’s probably no definitive 

answer for why Desiigner hasn’t 
caught too much flack for his 
subtle plagiarism. It might be 
because the GOOD Music moniker 
gives 
Desiigner 
temporary 

immunity from rap criticism. It 
might be that I have jumped the 
gun, and once “Panda” moves 
from “popular” to “overplayed” 
the criticism will come. My guess, 
though, is that people just don’t 
care about plagiarism in rap that 
doesn’t have to do with lyrics. 
Just look at Kanye, who’s made an 
entire career out of coordinated 
rap curation.

I love “Panda,” but I’m skeptical 

about how far Desiigner can go 
riding on the coattails of a city he’s 
never been to.

S

poilers for ‘The Room’ fol-
low. 

This weekend, scores 

of moviegoers, myself included, 
will line up at the State Theatre for 
the annual 
midnight 
showing of 
the 
2003 

film 
“The 

Room.” 
We will be 
treated to 
100 
min-

utes of a 
cinemati-
cally incon-
gruous, 
confused 
anomaly of a film. During this 
spectacle — which features plot 
points that arise only to be dropped 
immediately following their men-
tion, several anatomically ignorant 
sex scenes in the first 30 minutes 
and a medley of football-tossing 
shenanigans — we will laugh, we 
will hurl both insults and plastic 
spoons at the screen and we will 
toss footballs. This is all a ritual 
honoring the cult classic film that 
many regard as the king of worst 
films ever.

I’ve never seen “The Room” in 

a theater, and so I look forward to 
partaking in the shared experience 
of mocking and interacting with 
director-producer-writer-star 
Tommy Wiseau’s widely regarded 
fiasco of a film. And it’s very, very 
easy to mock. “The Room” very 
deliberately breaks all of the 
rules of cinema at every angle: a 
script that defies the bounds of 
the English language, camera 
movements 
that 
ignore 
the 

established setting (for example 
an effortless swipe left through 
what should be a wall), a complete 
lack of character direction so that 
characters appear and vanish 
at 
Wiseau’s 
will, 
overdubbed 

dialogue that doesn’t quite match 
up the movements of the mouth, 
etc. “The Room” doesn’t do 
just most things badly — it does 
everything badly. 

But to dissect every single 

problem the film has is best 
reserved for actually viewing 
the film. After all, that’s where 
much of the fun is. I’d rather try 
something more interesting and 
take a stab at analyzing Wiseau’s 
vision, if he even has one. No 
director, even if they’re the insane, 
probably stranded extraterrestrial 
that is Tommy Wiseau, sets out to 
deliberately destroy every accepted 
convention in film and achieve 
that destruction so successfully. 
“The Room” had a point, and it is 
perhaps worth examining what 
that point is.

An appropriate one-sentence 

summary I found for the film 
reads, “A happy-go-lucky banker 
sees his world fall apart when 
his friends begin to betray him 
one by one.” The banker, Johnny, 
is friendly, caring and honest 
and treats his fiancée, Lisa, to 
expensive gifts and frequent sex 
in what appears to be Lisa’s navel. 
This apparently solid relationship 
begins to unravel when Lisa 
decides she no longer loves Johnny 
and begins a passionate affair 
with Johnny’s best friend Mark. 
Ultimately the love triangle leads 

to a series of confrontations that 
result in tragedy.

This 
series 
of 
unfortunate 

events ignites 10 minutes into the 
film when Lisa’s mother Claudette 
comes to visit her daughter. Lisa 
tells her mother about her change 
of heart about Johnny, that he is 
“so … boring.” Claudette responds 
with an argument that switches 
between reminders of Johnny’s 
love and acknowledgements of 
Johnny’s wealth. Johnny, she says, 
“supports you, provides for you, 
and, darling, you can’t support 
yourself,” and “his position is very 
secure. And he told me he plans to 
buy you a house.” Lisa responds 
to her mother with reluctant 
acceptance, her face smoldering 
with disappointment.

With this telling first encounter, 

we come to realize that Lisa has 
been pigeonholed into the position 
of housewife. Her mother clearly 
views her as inept and incapable of 
fulfilling any role that is not as a sex 
object. And it is clear this is the role 
Johnny desires for his fiancée; that 
the very first meeting we see of this 
couple is their navel coitus, ended 
only by Johnny’s leaving for work, 
establishes Johnny as breadwinner 
and Lisa as concubine.

Compounding this relationship, 

which is reminiscent of 1950s 
values, with the obvious age 
difference between Johnny and 
Lisa (Johnny’s face bears the 
marks of a grizzled, hardened 
Vietnam vet and contrasts with 
Lisa’s sprightly 23 year-old visage), 
we come to understand that 
Johnny and Claudette represent 
the old world while Lisa embodies 
the generation that came of age 
either just before or just after 
September 11.

Yes, “The Room” is a study of 

the expectations and limitations 
of two warring generations, vying 
for dominance in this post-9/11 
America. Johnny and Claudette 
embody the Old World, and adhere 
to the old order with which they 
grew up and have lived for some 
time. Lisa, by contrast, personifies 
the new generation that sees how 
the Old World has failed to nurture 
its citizens and has repressed the 
young to elevate the established. 
Now the new generation, as Lisa 
says, “wants it all” and looks to 
upend the old — in cheating on 
Johnny, Lisa rebels against the Old 
World. Every scheme she concocts 
— creating a fake pregnancy and 
claiming Johnny has become 
abusive, 
while 
simultaneously 

defending and even glorifying 
him — mocks the old system and 
furthers her utter dismantling of it.

And it seems others too are 

shifting 
away 
from 
the 
Old 

World, as evidenced by Johnny’s 
encounter at the flower shop. “Oh 
hi Johnny, I didn’t know it was 
you,” the store owner says, despite 
the fact that 1) Johnny is evidently 
her favorite customer and 2) it is 
impossible not recognize a face 
that looks like Wormtongue from 
“Lord of the Rings” but was left 
just a little too long in the kiln. 
Indeed, society is leaving Johnny 
behind.

At the heart of this struggle 

between Old and New is Mark, 
torn 
by 
his 
friendship 
with 

Johnny and his equally powerful 

attraction to Lisa. Mark writhes 
under the weight of his actions, 
reaching his peak frustration 
when he very deliberately attempts 
to throw one of his friends off a 
building, only to schizophrenically 
and immediately revert back to 
his normal, amiable self. Each 
encounter between Mark and 
these two other indomitable forces 
draws him further into the fray, 
tugging at his loyalties whether 
through games of catch in the park 
with Johnny or sex with Lisa; it 
is the battle for Mark’s soul that 
provides the beating heart of this 
story.

The 
final 
confrontation 

between Johnny and Mark, a 
fistfight at a surprise birthday 
party for Johnny, solidifies Mark’s 
rejection of Johnny and the Old 
World. Johnny, despondent and 
tortured by remembrances of all 
he has lost, destroys his apartment 
and everything in it — the physical 
markers of his broken, capitalist 
system. 
“Why? 
Why 
is 
this 

happening to me?” he beckons, 
only to realize, “It’s over.” He puts 
a loaded gun in his mouth and 
pulls the trigger.

And so the two symbols of the 

Old World, Johnny and Claudette, 
are destroyed — Johnny by his 
own hand and Claudette by her 
inevitable demise due to the 
breast cancer that she mentioned 
in passing at one point. His body 
positioned cross-like, recalling 
the Christ, Johnny must die for 
the building of a new world. What 
that world brings is uncertain. 
Perhaps Mark and Lisa will 
build a life together — despite his 
insisting she “drop off the Earth, 
that’s 
a 
promise” 
(whatever 

that means), Mark stays with 
Lisa to comfort her and Denny, 
Johnny’s creepy ward — perhaps 
they won’t. Perhaps Denny will 
learn from Johnny’s mistakes, 
or perhaps he’ll embrace the 
murderer inside him that is 
clearly seeping from just below 
the surface. The aftermath simply 
cannot be known.

What is known is almost every 

scene in “The Room” begins with 
someone entering a space, and ends 
with someone leaving it, and if that 
is not symbolism then I do not 
know what is: our time in a space, 
in a room, is finite, just as a ruling 
system begins and will eventually 
break under its own weight. How 
we perceive usurper and usurped 
depends on our positions within 
that system, but the system will 
certainly, one day, fall.

Destruction is the thematic 

core of “The Room,” mirrored 
in 
Wiseau’s 
destruction 
of 

every convention of film. What 
I 
previously 
described 
as 

problematic bad cinema might 
actually be Wiseau dismantling 
the old for something new. How we 
view “The Room” — as a comedy 
of errors or as a critical anti-film 
— speaks to an artistic vision, or 
megalomaniacal vision. Choosing 
which option is a privilege I leave 
to you, lest you be otherwise torn 
apart.

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW

Our hearts are broken, his 

heart is broken — we’re all 
broken.

By leaving 

Vampire 
Weekend 
— one of 
the most 
essential 
millennial 
bands to 
surface 
since Arcade 
Fire — Rostam Batmanglij, 
the band’s former producer, 
ensured that. But he wants to 
move on, and we’ll hear him 
out. His latest single, whether 
deliberate in that association 
or not, stays in the field of 
separation and heartbreak, as 
ROSTAM attempts to make 
a name for himself beyond 
Vampire Weekend.

The music video for “Gravity 

Don’t Pull Me” succeeds 
in this far better than its 
predecessors. While “EOS,” 
“Don’t Let it Get to You” and 
“Wood” could all feasibly be 
worked into his former band’s 
sound, this is ROSTAM’s first 
track on which he gives a true 
argument that he can flourish 
as an individual, not simply 
as support for an absorbing 
frontman or woman — at least 
production-wise. Where his 
first solo works each struggled 
at times to carry themselves 
through the whole track, 
giving a sense of unrealized 
potential, “Gravity Don’t Pull 
Me” turns and spins start to 
finish, maintaining the energy. 
The tail-end of the track 
evolves into a consuming synth 
reminiscent of the elusive 
electronic artist Jai Paul, and 
it features some of ROSTAM’s 
most captivating solo work yet.

Lyrically, though, ROSTAM 

still lags. His songwriting is 
basic and straightforward, a 

strong contrast to Vampire 
Weekend frontman Ezra 
Koenig’s complex witticisms 
and intricate tales. “Gravity 
Don’t Pull Me” gives itself 
away clearly: “And the worst 
way I ever felt / Was from 
this same boy that I still miss 
/ Cause I messed it up / And 
it broke my heart.” Still, it’s 
a strong enough message to 
complete the track and add 
some emotion while it’s at it.

The video that accompanies 

the track reflects the 
lyrics — stripped-down, 
straightforward and 
occasionally interesting. 
ROSTAM enters our view 
singing into a mic and spends 
the rest of the video doing 
just that. The true driving 
force behind this video is the 
dancers, Jack Grabow and Sam 
Asa Pratt. Their compelling 
choreography, peaking when 
their mirrored movements 
become nearly indecipherable 
from one another, captures 
the pop sensibility of the track 
and the longing that its words 
divulge. The camerawork and 
the visual effects speckled 
throughout add traces, making 
sure not to interfere too much.

The video, however, suffers 

from the same problem his 
prior releases did: unrealized 
potential. The best moments, 

when the song, dance and 
effects are most in-sync, are 
too often disrupted or tabled 
for more scenes of ROSTAM 
at the mic. It’s understandable 
that he wants the focus on 
himself for a change, but it’s 
too jarringly generic against 
the backdrop of the track and 
the dancers. When the video 
ends with ROSTAM walking 
slowly away from the stand, it’s 
difficult to shake off a feeling 
of hackneyed millennial 
cheesiness.

One commenter aptly notes, 

“This is the most New York 
thing I’ve ever seen,” and while 
for that I would direct readers 
to Matt and Kim’s “Daylight” 
video, the specter of New 
York is clear. The dancers are 
dressed in all black, there’s a 
grimy white wall, a fashionable 
looking rain-jacket and a 
general sense that everyone 
involved in this video lives in 
Brooklyn.

That’s not necessarily a bad 

thing. But for an artist trying 
his best to establish his own, 
ROSTAM risks succumbing 
to his affiliations when he 
needs to transcend them most. 
“Gravity Don’t Pull Me” is a 
step in the right direction. It’s 
still just a step.
