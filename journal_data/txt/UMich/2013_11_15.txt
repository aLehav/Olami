Delta Phi Epsilon
will lose house to
Gamma Phi Beta
By CHRISTY SONG
Ditly StaffReporter
There will be some new Greek
letters on campus in the coming
years as a chapter of the Gamma
Phi Beta sorority returns next fall
and the University considers add-
ing two additional sororities.
Due to a record number of
students during registration for
recruitment and with the quota
limiting 62 recruits per pledge
class this year, a committee made
up of representatives from each
campus sorority decided to extend
the sorority community and invite
three more organizations to join.
In addition to Gamma Phi Beta,
chapters of Alpha Omicron Pi and
Kappa Delta may find their way to
campus in the next four years.
The process of looking for new
sororities began in Winter 2012.
The committee accepted pack-
ets of infor sation from national
sorority organizations that were
interested in joining the Univer-
sity community and narrowed the
applicants.

While Alpha Omicron Pi and
Kappa Delta have been invited to
join campus, whether or not they
will join depends on if the Greek
community feels it's ready for new
additions when the time comes for
the chapters to join.
The committee wants to ensure
the growing number of new
members experience the same
tight-knit community previous
generations shared without being
overcrowded, said LSA senior
Emily Goor, the president of the
Pan-Hellenic Council.
Although Gamma Phi Beta is
joining next year, the sorority
has a long history with the Uni-
versity, going back to 1882, when
it was brought to campus. One of
its founders, Frances E. Haven,
was the daughter of a University
professor and six of their national
presidents were members of the
University's chapter. Upon hear-
ing of the chapter openings, Goor
said the sorority seemed really
excited to jump onboard.
While the addition of Gamma
Phi Beta has been met with excite-
ment, it has caused a logistical
problem for the University's chap-
ter of the Delta Phi Epsilon soror-
ity.

Social Innovation
Alliance will work
to find solutions
By JENNIFER CALFAS
Daily StaffReporter
Fight the power! Construc-
tively, of course.
As part of the Victors for
Michigan fundraising cam-
paign, LSA hopes to raise $400

million; a fraction of the cam-
paign's $4 billion goal. Pending
donor support, the college has
already announced its inten-
tion to begina Social Innovation
Alliance Center to find solutions
to expansive social issues.
Although the center's plan-
ning is still in its early stages,
SIA aspires to have a $4 mil-
lion endowment and contribute
funds to annual fellowships,
one-credit mini-courses, sum-
mer innovation grants and an

annual social innovation chal-
lenge as a result of the campaign.
Specific programs will be devel-
oped as donor support increases.
The new center will partner
with optiMize, a student-run
organization with an analogous
mission.
Philip Deloria, LSA's associ-
ate dean for undergraduate edu-
cation, wrote in a statement that
the center reflects larger goals
within the college such as using
a diverse education to challenge

and solve real-world problems.
"The Social Innovation Alli-
ance unites the energy and ideas
of committed students with
a support structure that will
enable them to bring those ideas
to fruition," Deloria wrote.
After serving as optiMize's
organizational sponsor, LSA has
expanded its commitment to the
center's creation. Since students
founded the organization, Delo-
ria said the Social Innovation

Last May, the University
launched The Michigan Mobility

Medical faculty
clinch prestigious
research awards

Professors
honored by AAMC
at meeting in
Philadelphia
By JULIA LISS
Daily StaffReporter
Earlier this month, two
faculty members of the
University Medical School
received top awards from
the Association of American
Medical Colleges at a meeting
in Philadelphia.
Huda Akil, who is a pro-
fessor of neuroscience in
psychiatry, won the Award
for Distinguished Research
in the Biomedical Sciences.
Akil studies the biology of
the brain with a particular
focus on mood, emotions and
addiction, oth in humans and
animals, inthe hopes of devel-
oping possible treatments for
psychiatric disorders.
Akil said she was "surprised
and honored" to win the
award and felt strongly that it
was the shared efforts of her
team as a whole that deserved
recognition. She plans on con-
tinuing her research on the
role of emotion because she
believes it is still one of the
least understood and impor-
tant aspects of the brain.
"I feel that when emotions
go wrong in a chronic way,
when people feel stuck with

their emotions, the price of
that is really very high on the
person themselves, on their
family and on society in gen-
eral," Akil said.
The other award recipi-
ent was Gilbert Omenn, who
received the David E. Rogers
Award.
Omenn is a professor of
internal medicine, human
genetics, and public health
and is director of the Center
for Computational Medicine &
Bioinformatics at the Univer-
sity. He said he was pleased to
earn the recognition, because
it's a lifetime award that was
named after a doctor whom
Omenn knew personally.
"I actually worked directly
with him, so that was really
quite wonderful," Omenn said.
The David E. Rogers Award
was presented as a monetary
prize as well as an engraved
glass sculpture. Though
Omenn could not specify
exactly what he plans to do
with the money at this time,
he promises to donate it to a
new or existing initiative at
the University involving medi-
cine and public health.
Omenn is currently look-
ing forward to holding a
leadership role in the Human
Proteome Project, an interna-
tional research goal similar
to the Human Genome Proj-
ect. Additionally, he and his
colleague are competing for
a grant toward their BigData
project.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP
University receives award for
encouraging economic growth

Award recognizes
work with public
and private sectors
By HILLARY CRAWFORD
Daily StaffReporter
The Association of Public and
Land-grant Universities recent-
ly granted the Economic Pros-
perity Award to the University
for its efforts integrating entre-
preneurial education with state-
wide economic initiatives.
The APLU, the oldest higher
education association in the
United States, is a research and

advocacy organization with
219 university members. The
APLU's Commission on Inno-
vation, Competitiveness, and
Economic Prosperity, which
established the Economic Pros-
perity Award, encourages mem-
bers to assess their own work in
regional economic development.
Northern Illinois University,
the University of Cincinnati and
the State University of New York
also received the award. The
APLU said the four universities
were chosen because they col-
laborated with both private and
public sector business partners
and actively promoted statewide
economic growth.

Marvin Parnes, managing
director for the University's
Institute of Social Research, had
a role in applying to the award
during his time as the Univer-
sity's associate vice president
for research. He said as a public
institution, the University has
an obligation to be "more delib-
erate in helping improve the
economy."
In its application, the Uni-
versity highlighted three inno-
vation programs, including the
Institute for Research on Labor,
Employment, and the Economy;
the Business Engagement Cen-
ter; and the Michigan Venture

Ethnic group
declares self-

northeastern area
BEIRUT (AP) - Syria's Kurds
have dramatically strengthened
their hold on the far northeast
reaches of the country, carving
out territory as they drive out
Islamic militant fighters allied
to the rebellion and declaring
their own civil administration
in areas under their control this
week amid the chaos of the civil
war.
The moves could be a first
step toward creating an auton-
omous region similar to one
Kurds run across the border
as virtually a separate coun-
try within Iraq. But the Kurds'
drive has angered rebels fight-
ing to topple Syrian President
Bashar Assad. It even worries
some Kurds, who suspect the
main faction leading the fight-
ing and the new administration
is actually acting on behalf of
Assad to undermine the rebel-
lion.

Kurds are the largest eth-
nic minority in Syria, making
up more than 10 percent of the
country's 23 million people.
They are centered in the impov-
erished northeastern province
of Hassakeh, wedged between
the borders of Turkey and Iraq.
The capital Damascus and Syr-
ia's largest city, Aleppo, also
have several predominantly
Kurdish neighborhoods.
The declaration of their own
civil administration on Tuesday
was a sign of Kurds' growing
confidence after taking control
of most of Hassakeh province
in an offensive against jihadis
that has accelerated in recent
months. The fighters, known as
the People's Protection Units,
have driven militants out of a
string of towns and have cap-
tured long stretches along the
borders with Turkey and Iraq,
easing the way for support from
fellow Kurds in those regions.
Only a day after the
announcement, activists said
Kurdish fighters captured nine
villages from jihadis. Kurdish
fighters are now in control of all
predominantly Kurdish cities in
the province as well as dozens

of villages and towns, though
jihadis continue to control pre-
dominantly Arab towns in the
province such as Shaddadeh.
"More than 75 percent of the
province is in the hands of the
People's Protection Units," said
Kurdish journalist Malba Ali,
who lives in Hassakeh.
Assad's forces largely pulled
out of the region late last year
when the Syrian military was
stretched thin by fighting with
rebels elsewhere in the coun-
try, effectively ceding control
of the area, though they main-
tain some security posts. Their
withdrawal sparked a fierce
competition between rebels -
mainly Islamic militant factions
- and the Kurds.
Kurdish officials say they
launched their offensive in
recent months after coming
under repeated attack by jihadis
from two al-Qaida-linked
groups fighting against Assad
- Jabhat al-Nusra, or the Nusra
Front, and the Islamic State in
Iraq and the Levant. The Kurds
say jihadis wanted to dominate
their region and impose their
hard-line ideology on the popu-
lation, which is largely secular.

DETROIT
Incoming Detroit
mayor's spending
budget approved
Mike Duggan has been

spending related to his transition
to the Detroit mayor's office.
A spokesman for state-
appointed emergency manager
Kevyn Orr says Thursday that
* Duggan's transition budget will
be paid from the city's restruc-
turing account.
Duggan appointed former
mayoral candidate Lisa Howze
and former police chief Ike
McKinnon Wednesday to lead
his transition team. The team
is expected to work with Orr's
staff.
Voters elected Duggan ear-
lier this month. The ex-Detroit

Burning chemicals
forces evacuation
of neighborhood
A Detroit company that makes
adhesives, paint, primers and

Thursday by a blaze that forced
authorities to evacuate sur-
rounding homes and a nearby
elementary school.
The fire started early Thurs-
day afternoon at Chemical
Technology Inc.'s offices and
warehouse on the city's east side
and sent up huge plumes of thick
smoke that were seen miles away.
Fire officials quickly labeled it
a hazardous materials situation.
Homes and other businesses
close to the company were evac-
uated, while some streets in the
area were shut down to traffic.
COLUMBUS, Ohio
Death row inmate
hopes to donate
organs to his sister
An eleventh-hour request by
an Ohio death row inmate to
donate his organs is raising trou-
bling moral and medical ques-
tions among transplant experts
and ethicists.
Less than a day before child
killer Ronald Phillips was set to
die by lethal injection, Repub-
lican Gov. John Kasich on
Wednesday postponed the exe-
cution so that medical experts
can look into Phillips' suitability
as an organ donor.
Phillips, 40, wants to give his
mother a kidney before he is put
to death and donate his heart to
his sister afterward.
The governor said he is open
to the possibility of Phillips
donating a kidney or other non-
vital organs before he is execut-
ed. But Kasich appeared to rule

out a post-execution donation.

Mass burial held in
Philippines after

Scores of unidentified bodies
were interred together Thursday
in a hillside cemetery without
any ritual - the first mass buri-
al in this city shattered by last
week's Typhoon Haiyan.
Six days after the disaster,
some progress was being made in
providing food, water and medi-
cal aid to the half-million people
displaced in the Philippines.
Massive bottlenecks blocking
the distribution of international

SORORITIES
From Page 1
Phi Beta's former house for
three years from the national
sorority. With its return next
year, DPhiE needs to find a
house by the end of their cur-
rent lease in 2015.
The sorority has already
begun its search and has a few
leads; they also may bring in
the help of a realtor. DPhiE is
looking for a home near their
current location and sees this
move as an opportunity to
grow and further expand the
sorority.
This is not DPhiE's first
move. Before they moved
into Gamma Phi Beta's house,
they rented out the University

chapter of the Zeta Tau Alpha
sorority house, until ZTA
returned to campus.
During this first transi-
tion, the sorority had one of
its largest recruitment years.
The organization has contin-
uously grown and the quota
has gradually risen to accom-
modate the popular demand
for Greek life, according to
Tiffany Neal, the assistant
executive director of DPhiE
housing.
Neal added that moving
could actually be beneficial to
welcomingnew members.
"DPhiE is now the largest
it has ever been in the his-
tory of being on campus at the
University of Michigan," Neal
said. "So, we just see this as an
opportunity."

Center. These programs served
as case studies, but the University
also mentioned its expansion of
entrepreneurship and entrepre-
neurial education in recentyears.
"I think the best thing we do is
train our students to go out and be
successful," Parnes said.
The University's Institute for
Research on Labor, Employment,
and the Economy, founded in
2008, works to promote under-
standing of the economic trends,
while creating specific programs
that can be implemented in eco-

nomically distressed areas of the
state.
The Business Engagement
Center, founded in 2007, also
played a significant role in the
APLU's assessment of the Uni-
versity. The center works in uni-
son with Technology Transfer
and other departments to attract
corporate businesses to relevant
research and technology devel-
oped on campus by staff and stu-
dents.
Similarly, the Michigan Ven-
ture Center has fueled the exten-

sion of University initiatives, as
it helps new campus-based start-
ups grow into influential corpo-
rate businesses that can serve the
needs of a larger constituency of
people.
Parnes hopes that the award
shows other universtities that
they have an obligation to serve
the larger public in the states in
which they reside.
"We often don't publicize as
much some of these activities,
so it's nice to see them get rec-
ognized."

CENTER
From Page 1
Alliance Center will function
as a "hybrid" - helping provide
resources, support and infra-
structure while maintaining
student leadership in innova-
tion.
Rackham student Jeff
Sorensen, co-founder of opti-
Mize, said his time as an LSA
undergraduate made him
realize that students have the
capacity to solve global issues,
but often have no clear path to
do it.
He created optiMize with
several other students to pro-
vide a platformwhere students
could take action. While the
organization's membership
has swelled from three to 30
participants, Sorensen said the
new center will allowthe orga-
nization's reach to continue to
grow.
"I hope that every student
that comes to Michigan won't
find barriers to entering a pro-
gram that helps them utilize
the passions that they have for
solving important problems
in the world and start taking
these steps towards making

that a reality for them the rest
of their lives," Sorensen said.
Since the program will be
student-led, Deloria said he
hopes it can establish a transi-
tional leadership position - a
Social Innovation fellowship
- to lead the program. The fel-
low may be a recent graduate
who is willing to further the
center's goals.
Considering that the Vic-

Bulger was found
guilty of racketeering
and 11 of 19 murder
charges
BOSTON (AP) - Former Bos-
ton crime boss James "Whitey"
Bulger was led off to prison
Thursday for the rest of his life,
accepting his punishment in
stone-faced silence as a judge
castigated the 84-year-old
gangster for his "almost unfath-
omable" depravity.
Bulger's sentencing for his
murderous reign in the 1970s
and '80s brought to a close a
sordid case that exposed FBI
complicity in his crimes and left
a trail of devastated families
whose loved ones were killed by
Bulger or his henchmen.

Many of the relatives had
vented their anger at Bulger
during the first day of his sen-
tencing hearing on Wednes-
day, calling him a "terrorist," a
"punk" and "Satan."
So when U.S. District Judge
Denise Casper announced the
punishment - two consecutive
life sentences plus five years -
there were no shouts of joy or
applause from the families, just
silence.
Afterward, many said they
took some satisfaction in know-
ing that Bulger will spend the
rest of his life behind bars.
"That old bastard is finally
going to prison. He's going to die
in prison," said Tom Donahue,
whose father was gunned down
by Bulger after he happened to
offer a ride home to a man who
was Bulger's actual target.
Bulger, the former boss of the

Winter Hill Gang, Boston's Irish
mob, fled the city in 1994 after
being tipped off by a former
FBI agent that he was about to
be indicted. He was a fugitive
for more than 16 years until he
was captured in Santa Monica,
Calif., in 2011.
His disappearance became
a major embarrassment for the
FBI when it was learned that
corrupt Boston agents had taken
bribes from Bulger and pro-
tected him for years while he
worked as an FBI informant,
feeding information on the rival
New England Mafia.
A jury convicted Bulger in
August in a broad racketeering
case. He was found guilty in 11
of the 19 killings he was accused
of, along with dozens of other
gangland crimes, including
shakedowns and money laun-
dering.

Finland finds economic boost from

portation Research Institute.
This project will use innova-
tive technology equipment to
evaluate how technological
connections between vehicles
can help improve road safety.
Approximately 3,000
vehicles have been equipped
with devices that allow them
to communicate with other
cars and send other vehicles
information about their sur-
roundings, such as road condi-
tions. The goal of testing these
connected vehicles is to get a
sense of how and what kind of
technology should be used to
develop safer automated cars
in the future. Though the test
will only last for a few months,
David Lampe, executive direc-
tor for strategic communica-
tions in the Office of the Vice
President for Research, is
hopeful for the future of the
program.
"We have this great system
in place and so the next ques-
tion for us is, rather than just
shut it down, how can we make
even further use?" Lampe said.
Lampe said the DOT has

invested $25 million in the
Safety Pilot Model Deploy-
ment, "the world's largest on-
road test of the concept."
Lampe also said the rela-
tionship with the automotive
industry and its funding of
research is one of the project's
great strengths.
Jonathan Levine, a profes-
sor of urban and regional plan-
ning, is also part of the project
as the only member from the
urban and regional planning
department.
Levine is concerned that
automated vehicles could
make commuting easier, lead-
ing to increased urban sprawl.
He added that technologi-
cal innovation tends to cause
migration to urban areas.
A remedy to this poten-
tial problem is promoting the
shared use of the cars.
"If I live closer in a dens-
er area, I get better service
because the density of vehicles
is higher," Levine said. "I can
order a vehicle very quickly
and, once it's done with me, it
goes off to somebody else very
quickly. So I believe deploying
it this way could strengthen
close in living rather than
becoming another sprawl."

After Nokia, country
finds new success,
export revenues may
exceed $2.7 billion
HELSINKI (AP) - From
mobile phones to mobile games.
Finland has found there's life
after Nokia in a bustling start-
up scene that's produced hugely
popular game apps from "Angry
Birds" to "Clash of Clans."
Mobile gaming is fast becom-
ing the Nordic country's new
flagship export industry, with
revenues expected to double to
2 billion euros ($2.7 billion) this
year.
About 150 game developers
were showcasing their ideas
to global investors this week
at the annual Slush confer-
ence - a hotspot for startups in
Europe. The conference, which
ended Thursday, has tripled in
size from 2012, with investors
representing venture capital
funding worth more than $60
billion.
"The whole startup thing
here is amazing," said New

Zealander Duane Atkins, a for-
mer Nokia engineer who found-
ed a startup of seven people in
Helsinki providing software for
social networks.
Many Finns hope startups in
general and game developers in
particular will preserve Fin-
land's position as a high-tech
hub as an era ends with the sale
of the phone division of Nokia
- once the industry bellwether
- to Microsoft.
Although still small com-
pared with Nokia, which in its
prime had annual revenues of
more than 30 billion euros, the
games industry employs some
2,200 people in more than 180
companies nationwide.
According to UBM Tech, a
global business information and
data company, Finland ranked
third in a survey this year of
300 leading European game
developers who were asked
where in Europe they thought
the best games would come
from five years from now. Only
Germany and Britain - much
bigger countries - ranked
higher. Finland's neighbor Swe-
den ranked fourth.
One of the most buzzed-

about Finnish game developers
is Supercell, creator of "Clash
of Clans" and "Hay Day" -
top-grossing apps for Apple's
iOS software in more than 100
countries.
Supercell started making
the games for tablets in 2011
with half a dozen people. Last
month, the company announced
it was selling a 51 percent stake
to Japanese investors for $1.5
billion.
Supercell chief Ilkka Paanan-
en said Finns have focused too
much on Nokia, a company that
became a symbol of the small
nation's successes and failures.
"There will never be another
Nokia, and there shouldn't be.
We need to spread knowhow
much more broadly," Paananen
told The Associated Press, add-
ing Supercell wants to invest in
Finnish startups to help new-
comers who show promise.
"We have so much talent here
that there's no reason why we
can't make this a new Silicon
Valley," he said. "It won't be the
same as in the U.S. but never-
theless a regional hub - just as
it seems to be already becom-
ing."


Federal officials hope
to levy $400,000 fine

PHILADELPHIA (AP) -
Federal officials cited glaring
violations of accepted safety
standards Thursday in pro-
posing nearly $400,000 in
fines against two companies
involved in a botched build-
ing demolition in Philadelphia
that killed six people.
The willful and serious
breaches by Campbell Con-
struction and S&R Contract-
ing led to the collapse of a
large masonry wall onto a
thrift store, according to
the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration.
"If these employees had
simply followed the mostbasic
safety precautions, no lives
would have been lost," said
David Michaels, an assistant
secretary in the U.S. Labor
Department.
The companies' respective
owners, Griffin Campbell and

Sean Benschop, have 15 days
to respond to the citations.
Their lawyers did not immedi-
ately return calls for comment
Thursday.
Workers had been knock-
ing down a vacant four-story
structure in June when an
unsupported wall crashed
down onto an adjacent Salva-
tion Army store filled with
shoppers, killing six and
injuring more than a dozen.
The demolition site was
chaotic and dangerous,
according to the 12 citations
issued Thursday. Campbell,
the prime contractor, was
fined $313,000 for violations
such as not razing the build-
ing from the top down; leav-
ing an unsupported wall more
than one-story high; failing
to commission an engineer-
ing survey; and not providing
hard hats for employees.

Transparency through information freedom
Bill provides citizens with realisitic access to government records
The Michigan Freedom of Information Act was created to guaran-
tee public access to state-level government records. However, based
on the law, the public bodies holding documents can unilaterally
control information through delays, unreasonably high prices and dubious
denial of requests. In response to these problems, the recently proposed
House Bill No. 4001 marks the latest attempt at FOIA reform. Journalists
have a lot at stake with FOIA, but the bill deserves attention from anyone
even moderately concerned with Michigan's governance. Passing the bill
would provide Michigan's citizens with realistic access to FOIA documents,
upholding the expectation of government transparency and accountability.

T he Detroit Free Press
recently published an edi-
torial about the devastating
effects of scrap-
ping on Detroit
neighborhoods.
The article aptly
discusses the
need for - hope-
fully impend-
ing -- legislation,
that will make
it difficult for ALEXANDER
scrappers to sell HERMANN
obviously stolen
materials, one of
the biggest issues facing the bank-
rupt city today.
No surprises here - I couldn't
agree more with the Freep's incred-
ibly uncontroversial opinion.
what, then, is missing from their
otherwise on-point analysis? Some-
thing - anything really - that
grounds scrapping, and its processes
and effects, in reality.
Let's be real, scrapping and the
fear of scrapping, squatting and
other related crimes don't regu-
larly instill fear in most University
students and Ann Arbor residents.
When we leave our homes for class
during the day, or even when we
leave them unoccupied for longer
periods of time over breaks, hardly
a thought is given to the potential
burglarizing of our TVs, gaming
consoles and personal possessions.
Even less consideration is given
to the possible theft of furnaces,
plumbing and copper wiring that
probably earns much less cash on
the black market.
These are fears many Detroit resi-
dents face every day - even though
scrapping is associated most with
recently abandoned homes. Unless
vigorously protected, a newly vacant
home in Detroit will be completely
vandalized within 48 hours.
Although I can never claim to
understand the true effects of scrap-
ping - neither the strain nor the
cost encumbering individuals -
working at a Detroit-based human-
services nonprofit prior to graduate

school exposed me, somewhat, to
these daily horrors.
The Detroit Rescue Mission,
the organization I worked for, had
a program that received donated
homes from individuals, banks and
the city of Detroit and, provided we
could repair the homes at an afford-
able price, deeded the fixed-up
properties to homeless families we
served. In my capacity, I frequently
ventured out to different parts of
the city to inspect homes under
consideration.
There isn't adequate space in
this column to do justice to what I
saw, but, almost exclusively, unless
the home was currently occupied,
there was no chance we'd acquire
the property. Not only are Detroit
homes among the oldest in the met-
ropolitan area - a common plight
in central cities across the United
States - but poorer occupants are
often financially incapable of invest-
ingintheupkeep ofthese properties.
As neighborhoods deteriorate fur-

Rescue Mission accepted a donated
home, we relocated a client to the
property immediately. They kept the
premises secured at night while we
finished the rehab work.
The only marginally effective
counter to scrappers targeting
abandoned homes is the diligence
of neighbors - but even then, the
limitations of such measures are
obvious when you consider the per-
vasiveness of abandoned structures
in Detroit - as many as 78,000
according to some estimates - and
the need for residents to, you know,
actually sleep at night.
Once, when looking at a home
near Grandmont on Detroit's west
side, a neighbor confronted me
upon hearing someone enter the
house. After explaining my orga-
nization's intentions, he told me
how he regularly had to chase away
squatters and scrappers alike in
the home. A college student in his
early, maybe mid-twenties, he was
attending the University of Detroit-

Michigan's FOIA, enacted in 1977, hardly
delivers the "free" information it promises. In
reality, public bodies can maneuver around
FOIA requests with relative ease. Officials can
withhold requested information up to five days
- sometimes longer when granted extension -
and don't necessarily have an incentive to speed
up the process. While this might appear reason-
able, it allows significant conflicts of interest to
develop. Freezing information when the need is
urgent, such as during elections or policy votes,
has the potential to distort the democratic
process. But most people don't even reach that
point, lacking the robust finances necessary for
fees. Joe Sontag of the National Federation for
the Blind was charged $2,400 for a request in
regards to a cafeteria's closing. Sontag called
the fee "outrageous," and couldn't appeal a case
without alegal staff to supporthim. Public bod-
ies also can contrive reasons to deny the pro-
cess outright, often without much explanation.
Fulfilled FOIA requests can make an important
difference in public issues, but the current stat-
ute does little in accomplishing its duty.
The prosed policy would rectify current

FOIA issues by imposing new rules and lower-
ing fees. Officials would be required to present
information free of charge, and if individuals
require copies of the documents, the charg-
es couldn't be more than 10 cents per page.
Requests delayed past the five-day deadline
would be deducted 20 percent of their total cost
every day; after five days. And repercussions for
arbitrary delay or denial, as judged by a circuit
court, would result in higher damages, now
$5,000 instead of the original $500 penalty.
These changes would shift the current legisla-
tion toward a more public-oriented policy that
counteracts bureaucratic attempts to circum-
vent FOIA. Legitimate concerns would gain
traction, and the paralysis caused by the cur-
rent system would be eliminated.
FOIA's premise of open information uses
the agency of proactive residents to maintain
a transparent, responsible state. But under
the current law, faulty protocol precludes
most inquiries' success before a request is
even made. This undermines not only the
freedom of information but the justice and
protection of citizens.

Ilsuring all aspects of health

Health insurance plans for University
employees - including faculty, staff and
graduate students - cover almost all aspects
of reproductive health and family planning,
including contraceptives, pregnancy ter-
mination, elective adult sterilization, male
sexual dysfunction treatments, and sexually
transmitted disease testing and treatment.
However, there is one troubling omission in
this coverage: fertility treatments. Not only
are fertility treatments omitted from stan-
dard coverage, but University employees also
do not even have the option to purchase addi-
tional coverage for fertility treatments on
any of the 2014 plans offered in the state of
Michigan by Blue Cross Blue Shield, Health
Alliance Plan or Priority Health.
The unavailability of access to fertility
treatments is much more than just a personal
issue: It can affect the University's competi-
tiveness when recruiting faculty and gradu-
ate students. Other Michigan universities,
most notably Michigan State University, offer
insurance plans that cover these treatments.
In recent meeting of Senate Advisory Com-
mittee on University Affairs, faculty mem-
bers raised concerns that the University's
benefits package could keep us from recruit-
ing top researchers. In the United States
from 2006 to 2010, 6.7 million women were
unable to get pregnant after trying for one
year or could not carry a baby to term, while
more than 600,000 men were medically diag-
nosed with an infertility problem. We cannot
assume that fertility treatments will be an
insignificant factor in a prospective faculty
member's to come to the University.
Furthermore, infertility affects a number
of marginalized groups and should be seen as
a social justice issue within the larger debate
about reproductive rights. Although much of
the debate has focused on a woman's right to
prevent and terminate pregnancy, we have
largely ignored a person's right to have chil-
dren, especially when he or she requires assis-
tance to do so. Professional women who must
delay having children to be competitive with
their male counterparts, young women diag-
nosed with premature infertility, gay couples,
cancer patients treated with radiation, and
people with traumatic injuries to their repro-
ductive organs are all disproportionately
affected by infertility. Infertility also dispro-
portionately affects African American and
Hispanic women, and those women are less
likely to receive fertility treatment.

In response to my own diagnosis of infer-
tility, I petitioned top-level administrators
and women's issue groups at the University
advocating for coverage of fertility treat-
ments for employees. Currently, the question
of whether or not to add coverage is under
the consideration of Laurita Thomas, the
associate vice president of human resources
for both academic and medical campuses.
Thomas will base her decision on guidance
from the Medical Benefits Advisory Com-
mittee, a voluntary committee of 10 men and
six women employed as doctors, lawyers and
academics. MBAC will finalize their recom-
mendation to Thomas at the committee's
meeting on Nov. 19.
Although I am pleased that the Univer-
sity is considering adding fertility treatment
coverage to our benefits plans, I remain con-
cerned that they will not support the cov-
erage based on feedback from University
President Mary Sue Coleman's President's
Advisory Committee on Women's Issues. A
representative of that committee reporting
from its last meeting said that few members
saw any hope of increasing health benefits to
include fertility treatments.
Members of the University community
may object to adding this coverage on the
grounds that fertility treatments are expen-
sive and experimental. First, while increases
in cost to the University may be a concern for
some, addingcoverage for University employ-
ees is not likely to increase health care pre-
miums. States like Massachusetts that have
mandated fertility coverage from insurance
plans have not seen costs associated with
infertility increase after adding the coverage.
Second, while fertility treatments used
to be novel and experimental, most disease
treatments, regardless of cost, become cov-
ered after the technology becomes standard
practice for effective treatment of the dis-
ease. In the case of fertility treatments, the
national average for success rate is an almost
50-percent chance of pregnancy from one
cycle of in vitro fertilization. This success
rate is higher than many other covered treat-
ments for other diseases.
My hope is that the University community
will recognize that access to fertility treat-
ments is not just important to our institution,
but it is also a social justice issue-spanning
gender, class, race and sexuality.

ver since I re-embraced the
warm, sometimes sweaty
arms of singlehood a few
months ago,
my roommate
Margaret and
I have talked a
lot about boys.
Guys. Men.
Everything in-
between. Last
year, these KATIE
conversations STEEN
wouldn't have
been very inter-
esting, and
probably would have centered on
"30 Rock," pizza, spooningor a com-
bination of the three. Now, it seems
every other day or so, I'm giving ol'
Marge some sort of an update as I
navigate through singlehood. But
since these conversations are not
to be discussed outside of the walls
of room eight of Minnie's Coopera-
tive House, I'll just sum up what we
share with two words - girl talk.
The funny thing about girl talk is
that it usually centers on ... not girls.
A quick look in the trusty Urban
Dictionary defines "girltalk" - not
to be confused with the mash-up
artist - as, "Deep conversation
between members of the female sex.
Contrary to popular believe, it is not
always about boys."
But if you have to say "it is not
always about boys," it's probably
going to be about boys for the vast
majority of the time. Like, 90 per-
cent of the time, with the other 10
percent being talking about how
your period has synched up with
your roommate's. Or something.
Anyway, this newfound bond-
ing over guys colloquially known as
girl talk got me thinking: If my life
were a movie - hah - and Marge
were in it, too, we would totally fail
the Bechdel test. The Bechdel test
requires that a movie has at least
two women in it and these women
talk to each other about stuff beside
men. It also got me thinking about
a conversation I had last summer
in the humid, crowded kitchen of
a Michigan House summer party.
"What makes you feel like a man,"
I had asked a friend for who knows
what reason. He thought about
it for a second, then referenced a
summer hiking trip he took that
involved all kinds of manliness -
not shaving, not showering, using
muscles, drinking beer, farting...
After he answered, my friend asked
in response, "What makes you feel

like a woman?"
"Umm... " I thought of various
forms of activity that can be placed
under the umbrella term of hanky-
panky. "Uhh?" I really had no idea.
While my friend was reminisc-
ing upon hiking up north, inhaling
and farting into fresh Midwestern
air like a true man, the only thing
I could think of in terms of defining
my womanhood ... required a man?
Recently, I decided to throw this
question around some more. To my
friends and housemates who iden-
tify as male, I asked, "What makes
you feel like a man?"
"Barbecuing. Bacon," "Working
on the car," "Sports," "Definitely
everything sexual," "Whenever I
drive," "Being outside," "Drink-
ing two fingers of whiskey, pints
at the pub" - the pub? Some were
a little more general - "I feel like
a man when I'm around women
because I'm strong," "If a situation
needed someone to take control of
it, I should be the default," "When
I need to act rationally." As one of
my housemates said, "A lot of things
that make me feel like a man make
also make me feel like an adult."
To my housemates who identify
as female, I asked, "What makes
you feel like a woman?" Like before,
the question could be interpreted in
different ways, but the results were
pretty similar: "Putting on lip-
stick," "Wearing heels," "Lacy, fun
underwear," "When I go on a date.
When a boy pays for me." Others
were fairly straightforward - "My
boobs." "When I get my period."
The generalizations I'm about
to make with this small, not ran-
domized sample of responses is by
no means applicable to everyone.
But I think it's worth pointing out
that the majority of the answers I
received were based off of stereo-
types and socially constructed ways
that we're raised to think about our
gender, our sexuality and ourselves.
The first magazine I ever sub-
scribed to was "Girls' Life," or "GL."
My much cooler neighbor who
was a year older than me had con-
vinced me that it was necessary to
my ability to survive middle school
- which was admittedly a little
bit true, looking back. Within two
months of being a "GL" subscriber, I
gained lots of important knowledge
like how to apply liquid eyeliner
and what foods to eat at lunch in
order to attract hott - with two ts
- guys. For the record, finger foods
are highly recommended, especial-

ly grapes - cute and healthy.
It appears "GL" hasn't changed
much since. A quick skimming of
the magazine's website shows that
it's all still there - fashion, makeup,
gossip, adorable cupcakes - pre-
sented in an array of pinks, purples
and baby blues. And what's the first
tab at the top of the "Girls' Life"
website? "Guys," which includes
sections like "Get a BF," "Ask Bill
and Dave" and "What Guys Think."
On a website specifically devoted to
the lives of girls, we have a whole
section focused on dudes. Hmm.
I headed over to the website for
"Boys' Life," a magazine created
by the Boy Scouts of America. Its
homepage was jam-packed with
things like "make a pingpong ball
launcher," "weird science projects,"
aguide tobuying just about any out-
doorsy piece of gear you can imag-
ine, "hobbies, projects, and other
fun stuff you can do," and abso-
lutely nothing about girls. In other
words, while we're learning how to
eat grapes cutely over at "GL," the
"Boys' Life" boys are actually doing
things! Hobbies! Projects! Expe-
riences! Stuff that's a hell of a lot
more fun than putting on lip-gloss.
Of course, "Boys' Life" is just as
guilty of pushing boys into fulfilling
the stereotypical expectations of
being a male - science, outdoorsy
stuff, physical activity. And I sup-
pose that's expected given that the
magazine is run by Boy Scouts peo-
ple. But damn it, at least the boys
are encouraged to do things instead
of just shop and worry about how to
attract a significant other.
And these expectations and ste-
reotypes persist into adulthood,
even if we recognize the stupidity
or untruthfulness of them. Accord-
ing to the responses of my house-
mates, "being a man" means doing
things, while women are supposed
to care about appearance and guys.
Sigh.
I'm not saying that my house-
mates' responses to my questions
affirm that they follow the expect-
ed gender roles. And I'm not trying
to tell people of any gender to not
buy makeup or talk about guys or
whatever else is "GL"-certified. I
am trying to remind everyone that
gender roles exist, and are perpetu-
ated by what we read and watch and
listen to and click on, and that they
begin at a young age.

DailyArts Writer
The concept of "selling out"
as an artist is nothing new to the
music industry. I don't want to
explore working definitions of
selling out, so much as why it's
significant. For that, I'll be using
Eminem's most recent release.
The Marshall Mathers LP 2, as
a framework for my discussion,
which I'm sure won't sit well with
loyal fans.
Some see selling out as corre-
lated with becoming mainstream,
working to alter an artist's vision
and limit creativity. Eminem was
put into the mainstream spotlight
after his career took off when he
got "produced by Dre." But, Emi-
nem didn't suddenly sell out: It
wasn't until he got a record deal
that he further explored his alter-
ego Slim Shady, and along with it
many highly controversial top-
ics, such as calling out a whole
host of celebrities and rampant
cussing. His most recent album
shows his ability to take risks,
too, with Marshall experimenting
with variations of his own voice,
occasionally exchanging his pri-
mary trademark edgy voice and
hard-nose tone for a relatively
more at-ease demeanor. This is
a risky move that likely wouldn't
have been contemplated if he had
"sold out" in a mainstream sense,
because it goes against the grain.
While people make a big deal
over it, selling out also doesn't
necessarily mean the music
sounds bad. Sometimes, an art-
ist who sells out produces music
that is bland, so while it appeals
to larger audiences, it's less
unique and meaningful.
Take the music video for Emi-
nem's "Survival," for instance:
It seems to be almost purely
an advertisement for the latest
"Call of Duty" game, featuring
video-game footage throughout
the music video - badass, right?
While this may be a questionable
movethe songitselfis still enjoy-
able, with smooth flowing verses
and soothing female vocals for
the chorus.
Often a red flag for fans is who
an artist collaborates with. In
The Marshall Mathers LP 2, the
song "Headlights" features Nate
Ruess, the lead singer of fun.
This can be viewed two ways: On
the one hand, Eminem is selling
out, adopting the whiney synth
sound of fun. for increased prof-
its, overall popularity, blah blah
blah. Back to the argument that
selling out can sound bad, let's
just say this is certainly not my
favorite song on the album.
On the other hand, you can
view Eminem as trying some-
thing new and expanding his
musical repertoire. Many bands

try new sounds and flavors, and Eminem is trying to project his

So, if selling out doesn't have The Marshall Mathers LP 2

that to remain possible, Michi-

- something it has struggled to
do in recent years - at North-
western.
Despite an 0-5 Big Ten record
that's disappointing considering
the early season expectations,
the Wildcats enter Saturday's
game as three-point favorites
over the reeling Wolverines.

In addition to aiding the non-
existent running game, the
offensive line needs to figure
out how to give Gardner more
time in the pocket. He has been
sacked seven times in each of the
past two games.
Gardner hinted this week that
short routes for the receivers
might be the only way around
the inadequate pass protection.
While sophomore Devin Funch-
ess and fifth-year senior Jeremy
Gallon have been targeted suc-
cessfully deep in some key spots
this season, the time simply isn't
there for Gardner to wait around
on deep routes.
When Michigan takes the field
for the first time with a Big Ten
title out of the picture, Hoke
said there's no reason to expect
anything less than 100-percent
effort out of his team.
"Well, number one, you're a
competitor," Hoke said. "You
want to go out and fight. We
always play for our seniors, and
we're always going to work hard
for those guys. The other thing
is, you have a chance to win 10
football games. That opportu-
nity is always out there. That's
always been a benchmark."

ing the Wildcats one less threat

Wolverines aren't able to stop

expect a different result Satur-
day, especially considering the
offense's massive struggles.

tive yardage on the ground in the
past two games.

Michigan pass offense vs.
Northwestern's pass defense
It seems like everything ties
back to the offensive line, doesn't
it? Redshirt junior quarterback
Devin Gardner has taken a beat-
ing the last two games, partially
because he's getting no protec-
tion but partially because he's
hanging onto the ball too long.
In two games, he's been
sacked 14 times and hit countless
other times. By the end of last
week's 17-13 loss to Nebraska, it
was taking him a while to get off
the turf after being hit.
Can he sustain that type of
pressure this week? It almost
doesn't matter that Northwest-
ern is the No. 11 pass defense in
the Big Ten and is allowing close
to 250 yards through the air per
game. If the Wildcats can get
pressure on Gardner - which
doesn't seem to be too hard now-
adays - that's all that matters.
Still, Gardner is one of the
best athletes in the conference,
as is his favorite target, fifth-
year senior wide receiver Jeremy
Gallon. If those two can get just
a split-second more time in the
pocket, Michigan should be able
to succeed against an unimpres-
sive Northwestern secondary.
Edge: Michigan
Michigan rush offense vs.
Northwestern rush defense
Negative 69 rushing yards in
the last two games. Negative 69.
There's really nothing more
that needs to be said here.
Edge: Northwestern
Northwestern pass offense
vs. Michigan pass defense
The strong suit of North-
western's offense is the running
game, but the passing game is
nothing to overlook.
The offense operates entirely
from the shotgun and utilizes
two quarterbacks, Kain Colter
and Trevor Siemian. Colter is
more of a runner, while Siemian
is the more prototypical pocket-
passer.
Combined, the duo has com-
pleted almost 70 percent of their
passes while throwing for 11
touchdowns and almost 1,900
yards.
All season, Michigan's pass
defense has been bend but don't
break. It's weathered massive
passing performances from
Indiana but given up easy first
downs against Nebraska.
Last week, defensive coor-
dinator Greg Mattison decided
to switch up his starting safe-
ties, going with senior Court-
ney Avery and redshirt junior
Josh Furman. Apparently, usual
starter Thomas Gordon had an
ankle injury, even though the
redshirt senior played special
teams.
The new starters, Furman in
particular, struggled early on.
And on the biggest play of
the game, a fourth-and-2 late
in the fourth quarter where a
stop would have won the game,
Michigan's cornerbacks played
eight yards off the line of scrim-

mage.
The result was a 26-yard com-
pletion that essentially gave the
game to Nebraska.
Michigan's secondary has
been solid all season, and North-
western isn't a terror through

the air. Still, mistakes like that
fourth-down play last weekend
could be the difference against
the Wildcats.
Edge: Michigan
Northwestern rush offense
vs. Michigan rush defense
Some of the Conrhuskers' big-
gest offensive plays last week
came off of option pitches,
including the go-ahead score
late in the fourth quarter.
So this is Northwestern's
biggest advantage on Satur-
day because if the Wolverines
struggled against the option last
week, it's only goingto get worse
in Evanston.
The Wildcats rely on Colter
to rip apart defenses out of the
option, which he's done to the
tune of 523 yards and four touch-
downs this season. The main
running back he's pitching to,
Treyvon Green, averages more
than six yards per carry.
This unit is missing star run-
ning back Venric Mark - who
was a second-team All-Big Ten
selection last year - due to a
fractured left ankle but could
still give the Wolverines fits.
In practicethis week, redshirt
junior wide receiver Anthony
Capatina has been the scout
team quarterback and the one
Michigan has been practicing
the option against.
Whether that matters
remains to be seen, though,
because in order for Colter and
the running game to not have
a field day, Michigan's young
defense is going to have to stay
disciplined and not forget its
pitch assignments. It's allowed
just 3.2 yards per carrythis year,
but it also hasn't seen an option
like Northwestern's.
Edge: Northwestern
Special teams
Junior punter Matt Wile had
arguably his best game of the
year against Nebraska, punting
six times while averaging almost
49 yards per punt, including a
69-yard blast in the second quar-
ter. He also missed a 52-yard
field goal, but fifth-year senior
kicker Brendan Gibbons picked
up the slack by going 2-for-2.
Northwestern's special teams
unit, from kicker to punter to
kick returner, are all solid if not
unspectacular.
Edge: Michigan

Northwestern hasn't won a
game in the Big Ten yet. The
Wildcats came close against
Ohio State and even closer
against Nebraska, but still,
that's the bottom line for ateam
expected to compete for a Big
Ten title before the season.
But in a way, that's almost
an advantage. Northwestern is
going to have a breakthrough
game at some point this season.
Why not this weekend,
against a Michigan team that's
lost three of its last four, has
heard boos for the first time in
Michigan Stadium in the three
years Brady Hoke has been
the coach and has consistently
struggled on the road?
If that breakthrough is going
to come, it's going to come this
weekend.

Though the rink seldom fills

being upheld - sent Michigan to
a regional final before going to
its 24th Frozen Four.

Senior defenseman Mac Bennett has three assists and 14 blocked shots as a captain this season.

hockey weekend."
Unlike Michigan, Nebraska-
Omaha (5-5) has played five
straight weeks of hockey enter-
ing this weekend's series, includ-
ing matchups against No. 15
North Dakotaand No.19 Cornell.
The Mavericks are 2-4 at home.
But, much like the Michi-
gan Tech team Michigan (6-1-1)
faced early this month, Nebras-
ka-Omaha's record is more a
reflection of its schedule than its
talent. Still, three years after the
last meeting, the coaching staff
expects a similarly high-tempo
team this weekend.
"We expect speed and skill,"
said Michigan assistant coach
Billy Powers. "They're a team
that plays with great tempo, and
they really get up and down the
ice well. I think it's been a staple
of (Nebraska-Omaha coach)
Dean Blaze's teams back to his
North Dakota days. They're very
impressive on film, in particular
their ability to create offense."

In addition to downtime and
team bonding during the bye
week, the Wolverines switched
lines up once again in practice
last week, hoping to spark an
offense that will find the back of
the net more than .082 percent of
the time. Michigan's 22 goals in
eight games are tied for 28th in
Division-I hockey.
The bye week has given new
lines - namely that of freshman
forward Tyler Motte, sopho-
more Andrew Copp and junior
Phil Di Giuseppe - time to build
the necessary chemistry to make
an impact this weekend.
Even with a few off days
last week, captain Bennett was
pleased with the energy in prac-
tice both week.
"We still get worked pretty
hard," Bennett said Monday. "It
was nice to have those off days.
Sometimes in an off week guys
kind of slow down a little bit,
but I thought everyone brought
their 'A' game to practice, and

they were excited and ready to
be there."
Extra practice time also made
the choice between freshman
goaltender Zach Nagelvoort and
sophomore Steve Racine - who
both delivered strong practices
this week - that much more dif-
ficult. Though Michigan coach
Red Berenson made his decision
Tuesday after practice, Powers
said that he would announce
Friday's starter to the team on
Thursday before practice.
Though talks of a platoon sys-
tem like that of former Wolver-
ines Shawn Hunwick and Bryan
Hogan persist, Powers said the
series will not necessarily be
split. If Friday's starter earns a
win, he will likely be in the net
on Saturday. If Michigan loses,
expect to see Friday's backup in
the crease this weekend.
For now, Berenson will make
his decision one win at a time. It
is the motto of this team, after
all.

where the forecast calls for tem-
peratures in the high 70s - they'll
be in blustery Ames, Iowa, home
to a perennially scrappy team and
one of the toughest road environ-
ments in the country.
Both the seventh-ranked Wol-
verines and Iowa State have cake-
walked through two blowouts,
and Sunday's game will go a long
way in answering questions about
the legitimacy of each team's
early season expectations.
Though the Cyclones fell short
of a preseason ranking, most
expectations tabbed them some-
where in the Big 12's upper ech-
elon. A big part of that is because
Iowa State rarely loses at home;
the Cyclones are 32-3 in Hilton
Coliseum over the past two sea-
sons.
And if a raucous home envi-
ronment isn't enough to rattle the
freshmen, Dick Vitale will be on
hand to call the nationally tele-
vised game - a first for freshmen
like Walton and guard Zak Irvin.
On a Thursday teleconfer-
ence, Michigan coach John
Beilein raised eyebrows when
he announced that the timeline
for sophomore forward Mitch
McGary's return may be drasti-
cally abbreviated. Earlier indica-
tions suggested that McGary may

miss all of November, and per-
haps even December, but Beilein
told reporters that his big man
began participating in drills that
he hadn't done since last year,
and that his return will probably
"happen very quickly."
Still, even if he dresses on Sun-
day, don't expect McGary to play
- which is unfortunate for the
Wolverines given the Cyclones'
undersized frontcourt.
Even without McGary, 6-foot-
10 redshirt junior forward Jon
Horford could exploit a mismatch
on the block - Iowa State's start-
ing forwards are 6-foot-6 and
6-foot-7.
But while Beilein has praised
Horford's rebounding abilities
this season, the forward has
never been a reliable offensive
threat.
Until McGary returns to the
floor, Michigan will need to rely
on production from the wing,
where it has a wealth of options.
Sophomore guards Caris
LeVert and Nik Stauskas and for-
ward Glenn Robinson III have
scored 101 of theteam's 162 points
through two games - 62.3 per-
cent of the offense - and that fig-
ure will likely increase as games
get more competitive and role
players' minutes decline.
Iowa State nearly eliminated
Ohio State in the third round
of last year's NCAA Tourna-
ment, but its starting backcourt
has since graduated, and the
Cyclones' best player, forward
Melvin Ejim, is injured and isn't
expected to play.
Especially with Ejim out,
the game should come down to
whether Michigan can play with
composure. Barring a completely
flat performance, the Wolverines'
talent should be enough to over-
come some marginal road strug-
gles from the freshmen.
"I think we're ready," Stauskas
said. "Hopefully, they don't get
too scared or too nervous of the
moment, and I'm pretty sure they
won't.
"I guess we'll see on Sunday."

After taking mgoblue.com
his team to the
Sweet 16 last
year, Michigan
coach Greg Ryan is confident that
this year could be "very special."
Saturday, the third-seeded
Wolverines (9-1-1 Big Ten, 15-3-1
overall) will host Wisconsin-Mil-
waukee in the first round of the
NCAA Tournament. This week-
end's winner will move on to face
the victor of Louisville and Illinois
State.
The Panthers are coming into
their 11th NCAA Tournament as
conference champions. In Sun-
day's Horizon League champion-
ship game, forward Kelly Lewers
scored with 23 seconds left to
lift her team to its sixth straight
tournament title. She is second on

her team with nine goals and was
named both tournament MVP
and Horizon League Player of the
Year.
But of the five NCAA Tourna-
ment teams it has faced this sea-
son, Wisconsin-Milwaukee has
only one victory. Of those four
losses, one was at the hands of
Michigan in the season opener.
The game ended in a 3-0 shutout
victory for the Wolverines.
"We played them early in the
year, and both teams were just
gettingstarted," Ryan said. "How-
ever, both teams have improved
tremendously since then."
In last week's Big Ten Tour-
nament, old scoring struggles
returned to force a first-round
Michigan exit. Still, Ryan feels
that the early elimination actually
gave his team a huge advantage.
With 11 days off, the team had
the opportunity to physically and
mentally recover before hitting
the field once again.
"These are possibly our best
days of training all year," Ryan
said. "The reason is we were able
to rest. It's amazing what it does
for the legs, the mind and the
spirit."
Added senior defender Holly
Hein: "We've been working on the
fundamentals, like making sure
our back line is sound, getting to
the goal and making sure every-
one is committed to scoring and
working collectively."

If the Wolverines are going to
score, they will need to do it early.
In the games when it scores first,
Michigan is 13-0. To continue this
trend, Ryan has made his team
play pickup games that end when
the first goal is scored, empha-
sizing the importance of getting
ahead in the game.
"The key for us is not just
being content to have the ball but
to do something with it," Ryan
said. "We have to recognize that
whether we score first or not, we
have to continue to battle away."
Saturday, Michigan will have
home-field advantage as it host a
first-round game for the second
consecutive year. In fact, the Wol-
verines are undefeated (7-0) in
NCAA Tournament games in Ann
Arbor.
The last time Michigan was at
U-M Soccer Stadium was in its last
regular-season game against Ohio
State on Nov. 2. The chance to play
at home again is especially mean-
ingful for the seniors.
"It wasn't guaranteed that we'd
get another game here," Hein said.
"It's really nice to have at least one
more here, and we're really happy
about it."
Added Ryan: "Once the NCAA
Tournament starts, you have to
throw everything out. What's on
paper doesn't matter anymore.
It's what's in your heart, what's
in your mind and what's in your
body."

(1-1) in a
matchup of
the Ristovski sisters as the Wol-
verines look to rebound from
an overtime loss to Xavier on
Wednesday.
"It's all about the bounce
back," said Michigan coach Kim
Barnes Arico "That's part of our
job as coaches to say, 'Hey, we
don't have much time. We have
to turn around and play again
on Saturday, so we have to make
sure we're getting better every
day, and we're ready to go for
Detroit."'
When asked at Michigan
media day which game she was
most looking forward to play-
ing this season, Ristovski smiled
and answered almost immedi-
ately. Facing her sister would be
great, even if she was going to see
limited minutes, but with Ris-
tovski a late preseason addition
to the starting lineup, the sisters
will find themselves on the floor
together for much of the game.
"We are going to have a sister
rivalry," Ristovski said at media
day. "We're probably going to end
up guarding each other, so that
will be kind of cool."
Though Ristovski calls the
matchup "cool," her mother,
Svetlana Ristovski, couldn't be
more stressed about the game.
"They've always played
together, so it's really hard, and
I know they're so close, so it will

probably be really emotional for
them," Svetlana said. "And for
me, I'm sitting in the middle,
wearing neither color and root-
ing for both teams. May the best
team win."
To make matters more com-
plicated for the Ristovski family,
Madison's uncle is an assistant
coach for the Titans, and her
youngest sister also committed
to playfor Detroit nextyear.
"For Madison, I'm sure it's a
pretty big deal," Barnes Arico
said. "I'm sure it's going to be a
big game for the Ristovski family
as awhole. Madisonusuallyplays
well in big games, so hopefully
she'll be up to the challenge."
Added junior forward Nicole
Elmblad: "I think there's goingto
be a lot of emotions on Madison's
end for sure, but if the rest of the
team can just be around her and
just keep her focused, I think
she'll be ready to play."
Though it's early in the season,
the starting lineup has had suc-
cess with Ristovski in it. After
recording her first career start
against Bowling Green, Ristovski
came off the bench in Michi-
gan's second game of the season,
against Arizona.
Barnes Arico decided to put
Ristovski back in a starting role

in the Wolverines' home open-
er loss to Xavier. The Sterling
Heights, Mich. native posted a
career-high 12 points, adding
two rebounds and an assist.
Because Michigan has a quick
turnaround after a tough loss,
Barnes Arico may continue to
tinker with the starting lineup,
citing practice performance as
the primary determinant of who
sees playingtime.
"With a young team that we
have, I don't think anybody's
really established themselves
starting night in and night out
with the exceptions of maybe
(junior forward Cyesha Goree)
and Nicole," Barnes Arico said.
With Detroit looming, the
Wolverines need to look out for
guards Ellisha Crosby and Senee
Shearer, who average 14 and 13.5
points, respectively. Crosby also
adds 9.5 rebounds per game. The
Titans also field a fairly small
team, but their guards, particu-
larly Crosby, are on the bigger
side and could pose matchup
problems for Michigan.
But for Madison, the most
important guard on the floor
is going to be Haleigh, and the
battle of the Ristovski sisters
should provide for an entertain-
ing affair.

Jabrill Peppers: The next Woodson?

w

By JASON RUBINSTEIN
Daily Sports Writer
Dozens of reporters crowded a
glorified media closet that, on the
afternoon of May 27, 2013, served
as an ESPNU studio to broadcast
the college decision of a 6-foot,
205-pound athlete who can score
from virtually any position -
Jabrill Peppers.
Once the cameras started roll-
ing, Peppers dove right into a rap:
"I couldsee it now
The fans scream and yellin'
As I'm walking out that tunnel
Wearing a winged helmet
Go blue, baby. I'm going to
Michigan."
Seconds later, ESPN's No. 2
high-school player in the country,
an Under Armour All-America
Game invitee, put on the winged
helmet. Beaming with happi-
ness, he sealed his commitment
to Michigan,
The Wolverines hadn't seen a
commit with his potential two-
way abilities since they signed
Charles Woodson over a decade
ago, The ex-Don Bosco Prepara-
tory (N.J.) and current Paramus
Catholic (N.J.) star had become
Michigan's highest-ranked com-
mit ever, and any doubts about
coach Brady Hoke as a recruiter
were squashed.
The Woodson comparisons
immediately ensued.Yes, Charles
Woodson, the Michigan legend
and surefire NFL Hall of Famer.
Comparing a high-school senior
to arguably the best Michigan
defender ever seems a bit unfair,
but the 1997 Heisman Trophy
winner loves it.
"I don't think he should
dampen the expectations, but
he should embrace the expecta-
tions," Woodson said in an phone
interview with the Daily last
week. "From everything I have
read about Jabrill, he is a very
confident player, and you bring
that confidence to the next level.
It's good to have expectations,

his ability to contribute on both
sides of the ball, it is inevitable for
Wolverine fans to draw compari-
sons to Woodson.
Peppers will have his fair share
of mistakes early on, and teams
will certainly throw his way. But
when this happens, Peppers will
still think he's better than his
opponent and shrug off his mis-
take.
"My mindset is that Ihave been
playing this game my whole life,"
Peppers said. "I know what I got
to do, my coaches explain to me
the game plan, so if I am making
a mistake, it's on me, and I don't
want to chalk it up as a freshman
mistake."
Michigan defensive coordina-
tor Greg Mattison recruited Pep-
pers as a cornerback, but it willbe
hard to keep the offensive mon-
ster off the field - something ex-
Michigan coach Lloyd Carr had a
hard time doing with Woodson,
"My main focus was defense,"
Woodson said. "But Lloyd Carr
always let me know that if my
defense ever slacked off, even a
little bit, then he would take me
off of offense. That always made
me work that much harder and
make sure that whatever was
asked of me on defense that I got
it done."
Carr's tactics worked wonders
for Woodson. At the end of the
1997 season, Woodson became
the first defensive player ever to
win the Heisman Trophy.
Will Peppers have a similar
role? He certainly wants to. But
like Woodson said, players can't
get ahead of themselves.

player, but before he can do that,

itary-like setup with its players
working their way up, learning
from the upperclassmen along

conformity. He ran a 4.4 40-yard

race. More impressively, though,
