'M' dancing for first time since'98

No. 10 seed Michigan
to play No. 7 seed
Clemson in first
round Thursday
By ALEX PROSPERI
Daily Sports Writer
The Michigan faithful waited
more than 4,000 days and watched
more than 300, games in prepara-
tion for a day like Sunday.
And judging by the turnout at
Crisler Arena, it was worth the
wait.
For the first time since 1998, the
Michigan men's basketball team'
has. earned an NCAA Tournament
bid. CBS announced Sunday night
that No. 10 seed Michigan would
face No. 7 seed Clemson in the
South Regional in Kansas City on

Thursday at 7:10 p.m.
If the Wolverines win, they will
face the winner of No. 2 seed Okla-
homa and No.15 seed Morgan State.
"I knew that the country wants to
see the block 'M' back at the dance,"
MichiganAthleticDirectorBill Mar-
tin said. "I think it's a real defining
moment for our program this year,
It's just upward going forward."
The Wolverines (20-13) have
played their best basketball this
season with their backs against the
wall. Michigan was the 61st team to
have its name called Sunday, which
put the team through the grinder
yet again.
"It was very appropriate because
that kind of sums up our season,"
fifth-year senior C.J. Lee said.
"We've been right there, back and
forth all year."
When studio host Greg Gumbel
finally said 'Michigan' on the CBS
telecast, it was to the tune of hun-

dreds of screaming fans who filled
the lower bowl on the east side
of Crisler Arena. Michigan coach
John Beilein addressed the crowd
after the show.
"I don't even know because of
all the excitement, where are we
going?" Beilein asked.
Michigan waited more than a half
hour to hear its name called - not
an easy task for players or coaches.
"I was so nervous," fifth-year
senior co-captain David Merritt
said. "My stomach was turning
over just to think that there was a
chance we wouldn't make it. Luck-
ily and thank God that our name
came up as a10 (seed)."
Added Lee: "Of course I was ner-
vous. When you're seeing all those
spots beingtaken by teams that kind
of are similar to yourself, we were
just playingthe waiting game."

passed away at the

By VERONICA MENALDI
Daily StaffReporter
Bill - Davidson, Detroit Pistons
owner and Ross School of Business
alum, passed away last Friday at the
age of86.
Davidson died at his Bloomfield
Hills home, and
although the
cause of death is1
still unknown,
Davidson's
health had been
poor for the last
few years.
The funeral DAVIDSON
will be held at
Congregation .
Shaarey Zedek in Southfield, Mich.
Tuesday at noon.
University President Mary Sue
Coleman wrote in an e-mail state-
ment Saturday that Davidson will be
greatly missed here at the University.
"It was always a pleasure to spend
time with him, and my thoughts are

with Karen and their family," Cole-
man wrote in the e-mail to The
Michigan Daily. "We will miss him,
and we will honor his legacy as a
dedicated and successful alumnus."
As part of his legacy at the Uni-
versity, Davidson created the Wil-
liam Davidson Institute in 1992 at
the Ross School of Business. 'The
institute, according to its web-
site, is a "non-profit, independent,
research and educational institute
dedicated to developing and dis-
seminating expertise on issues
affecting firms in transition and
emerging market economies."
WDI Executive Director Robert
Kennedy, who worked with David-
son over the past six years, wrote
in an e-mail to The Michigan Daily
Saturday that Davidson loved to
help however he could, and was
truly a great man.
"Bill Davidson was a business
visionary, a great philanthropist
and a dedicated family man," he
wrote. "He was incredibly generous
to the University of Michigan.
"One of the nice things was that
it was never about him. Bill always
encouraged us to aim high and to
accomplish great things," he wrote.
"The thing he said most often was,
'How canI help?'"

U. Montana paper criticized for sex column

GEITHNER GOES ABROAD

The University of Montana's
student newspaper, the Montana
Kaimin, has recently come under
fire for publishing a column on sex,
the Montana Kaimin reported.
Kirsten Juras, an assistant pro-
fessor of law at the University of
Montana, has criticized the column
calling it inappropriate, the Mon-
tana Kaimin reported.
"It's embarrassingly unprofes-
sional," Juras told the Montana
Kaimin. "It affects my reputation
as a member of the faculty."
The student-run newspaper
operates separately from the uni-
versity, which has reportedly led
some supporters to claim Juras's
criticisms are not justified.
The Montana Kaimin began
publishing the sex column, which
has discussed topics like sex toys
and virginity, at the beginning
of this semester on the opinion
page of the newspaper, the paper
reported.

DRUG COMPANIES QUESTIONED economic situation, the report said.

Harvard Medical School research-
ers have come under increased
scrutiny for potential conflicts of
interest with drug companies, The
New York Times reported.
According to the report, a
newly created internal commit-
tee is questioning the ties pro-
fessors have to pharmaceutical
companies. Members of Congress
are also reportedly investigating
the issue at other schools across
the country.
Matt Zerden, a fourth-year stu-
dent at the Medical School told
the Times that his pharmacology
professor is a paid consultant to 10
drug corporations. Accordingto the
report, 1,600 professors have rela-
tionships with drug companies.

UNIVERSITIES THAT TOOK
EXTRA CHANCES.HIT HARD BY
ECONOMIC DOWNTURN
Colleges and universities that take
high-risk investments, over-build on
campus and over-estimate their bud-
gets have helped contribute to the
current economic crisis, The Chroni-
cle of Higher Education reported.
The Chronicle reported that
Yale University, which typically
earns 16 percent on its investments
and had $23 billion endowed last
year, has lost one quarter of its
investments.
Increased campus construc-
tion has contributed to the current
situation. According to a survey by
The Chronicle, 14 percent of col-
lege buildings were built in the
past decade.

NEWS BRIEFS
WASHINGTON
White House says
economy is sound
despite 'mess'
The economy is fundamen-
tally sound despite the temporary
"mess" it's in, the White House
said yesterday in the kind of upbeat
assessment that Barack Obama had
mocked as a presidential candi-
date.
Obama's Democratic allies plead-
ed for patience with an administra-
tion hitting the two-month mark
this week, while Republicans said
the White House's plans ignore
small business and the immediate
need to fix what ails the economy.
After weeks projecting a dismal
outlook on the economy, admin-
istration officials - led by the
president himself in recent days -
swung their rhetoric toward opti-
mism in what became Wall Street's
best stretch since November.
Duringthe fall campaign, Obama
ielentlessly criticized his Republi-
can opponent, Sen. John McCain,
for declaring, "The fundamentals of
our economy are strong." Obama's
team painted the veteran senator as
out of touch and failing to grasp the
challenges facing the country. .
WASHINGTON
Outrage sounded
over AIG bonuses
Leaders of the White House eco-
nomic team and the Senate's top
Republican bellowed about bonuses
at a bailed-out insurance giant and
pledged to prevent such payments
in the future.
From one Sunday talk show to
the next, they tore into the con-
tracts that American International
Group asserted had to be honored,
to the tune of about $165 million
and payable to executives by Sun-
day, even as the company has ben-
efited from more than $170 billion
in a federal rescue.
AIG has agreed to Obama
administration requests to restrain
future payments. Treasury Secre-
tary Timothy Geithner pressed the
president's case with AIG's chair-
man, Edward Liddy, last week.
"He stepped in and berated them,
gdt them to reduce the bonuses fol-
lowing every legal means he has
to-do'this," said Austan Goolsbee;
staff director of President Barack
Obaia's Economic RecoveryAdvi-
sory Board.
KABUL, Afghanistan
Bomb kills 4 U.S.
soldiers in eastern
Afghanistan
Aroadsidebombkilled fourAmer-
ican soldiers in eastern Afghanistan
yesterday - new evidence of rising
violence in a region where clashes
and attacks in the first two months
of 2009 more than doubled from the
same period a year ago.
The spike in violence along the
border is an early indication that
roadside bombs and other ambush-
es are likely to surge as thousands of
new U.S. forces arrive in Afghani- '

stan this year.
Brig. Gen. Richard Blanchette, a
spokesman for the NATO-led force
here, confirmed that. a roadside
bomb killed four U.S. troops in east-
ern Afghanistan. A U.S. statement
indicated the troops were based in
Jalalabad.
A suicide bomber, meanwhile,
attacked a NATO convoy in Kabul
on Sunday but instead killed two
passers-by - among18 people killed
Sunday, officials said.
EAST LANSING, Mich.
City authorities
look to fix riot laws
Authorities want to fine-tune the
city ordinance against rioting.
The existing law in part defines
a rioter as someone who assembles
or acts "in concert with four or
more other persons for the purpose
of engaging in conduct constituting
the crime of riot... "
Police Chief Tom Wibert says
that leaves "a lot of room for inter-
pretation," and he's supporting
revised language more specific to
riot-related behavior.
Wihert tells the Lansing State
Journal that the new categories
would include throwing' objects,
taunting police, discharging fire
extinguishers, "mooning" people
and wearing a gas mask to avoid the
effects of tear gas..
The amendments are being pro-
posed almost a year after Cedar
Fest, which attracted 4,000 people,
resulted in at least S5 arrests.

was also feeling the pressure.
"I told Coach (John) Mahoney
after the second (regional) that
we were probably going to be in
the last group, not really believing
it, but just kind of trying to psych
myself out," Jackson said.
When Michigan's name
appeared on the screen, the Wol-
verines jumped out of their seats
on the sideline and hugged each
other in a team huddle.
The lowerbowlwas mostlyfull a
half hourbefore the selection show,
and the Jumbotron was dropped to
about 10 feet from the floor so fans
could easily watch the broadcast.
When Beilein did an interview with
CBS 15 minutes before the start of
the selection show, he had to cover
his right ear because the Crisler
crowd was so loud.
Beilein joins Lefty Driesell,
Eddie Sutton, Tubby Smith, Rick
Pitino, Lon Kruger and Jim Her-
rick as coaches who have taken
four different teams to the NCAA
Tournament.
"We were hugging so many
people," Beilein said. "I don't
know if I saw the looks on (the
players') faces. There was a lot of
joy in the room. There was a lot of

passion out there."
The selection is the program's
21st all-time NCAA Tournament
appearance, and Michigan has a
41-19 overall record in the tourna-
ment. The bid comes just one year
after the Wolverines finished with
a dismal 10-22 record in Michigan
coach John Beilein's first season.
The Wolverines' strong RPI
(44) and strength of schedule (11)
were key to earning a bid. Non-
conference wins over Duke and
UCLA and Big Ten wins against
Illinois, Purdue and twice against
Minnesota, all teams that made
the tournament, also helped
Michigan's cause.
Despite sitting on the bubble
for the past few weeks, the Wol-
verines essentially locked a bid
after topping Iowa 73-45 in the
first round of the Big Ten Tour-
nament on Thursday. Even after
dropping its quarterfinal match-
up against Illinois, Merritt was
confident that Michigan had done
enough to earn a bid.
"Hopefully. I think we've made
a case," said Merritt when asked
Friday "We've played everybody
this year, haven't strayed away
from playing anybody. We've com-
peted in a tough conference. It's,
one of the best in the country."
Michigan could be difficult for
any tournament team to handle.

Dolan added that the new school
will help to improve the level of
education at the Business School.
"We have a distinctive approach
to education based around action
based learning and you need a
different kind of facility to sup-
port that work," Dolan said. "The
amount of space dedicated to
informal gathering right here in
the Winter Garden and the num-
ber of group study rooms, that was
really the kind of functionality
that we didn't have before."
Ross said he believes the Uni-
versity business community will
continue to rise to the occasion
and become the global business
school of the future.
However, Ross said that while
the physical construction is com-
plete, the school will not stop
being innovative.
"The school will continue to
build in order to make sure we
are creating future leaders of the
world," he said.
There aren't many teams who play
as much 1-3-1 and 2-3 zone defense
as the Wolverines. Michigan also led
the Big Ten in 3-pointers attempted,
meaning if the Wolverines get hot
from behind the arc, they have the
potential to go onbig runs.
The Wolverines were on the
other 'side of the tournament
bubble in 2007 after they fin-
ished with a 21-12 record. A pair
of losses to top-ranked Ohio State
in their regular-season finale and
the quarterfinals of the Big Ten
Tournament diminished their
tournament hopes.
In 2006, Michigan was 16-3
before losingsix of its last eight reg-
ular season games. The Wolverines
then lost to Minnesota in the first
round of the Big Ten Tournament.
Michigan settled for the Nation-
al Invitation Tournament in both
seasons, losing to South Carolina
in the title game in 2006. The Wol-
verines won the NIT in 2004.
In 1998, the last time Michigan
earned an NCAA Tournament
berth,.Beilein was in his first year
as head coach at Richmond and
freshman guard Stu Douglass was
seven years old.
Although Beilein said making
the tournament in his second year
with the Wolverines 'is ahead of
his initial rebuildingprocess, both
the team and fans appear ready.

DAVIDSON
From Page 1A
Davidson has given more than
$55 million to the University,
with $30 million going toward the
founding the WDI.
Coleman wrote that Davidson's
impact on the University commu-
nity will "last for generations."
"His generosity as an adviser, a
business executive and a philan-
thropist enhanced the teaching
and research experience for U-M
students and faculty," she wrote.
"He did not hesitate to share his
knowledge and expertise, and our
university is stronger for it."
Davidson also gave $20 million to
the Weizmann Institute of Science in
Rehovot, Israel, funded the William
Davidson Graduate School of Jew-
ish Education in New York, and pur-
chased the DetroitPistons for around
$7millionin 1974fromFred Zollner.
When Davidson bought the
team it was considered by many
to be a dying franchise. But during
his time as owner, Davidson trans-
formed the program that is today
worth $500million. Detroit Pistons

Presidential candidates will be

MSA Election Director Emily
Winter, who helped organize the

future president will make MSA
more transparent and the direc-

Current MSA Vice President
Arvind Sohoni and Jason Raymond,
rules and elections committee chair,
also helped to organize the event.
Page said he will select "salient
and challenging questions from
a stack of questions submitted by
interested students."
Winter said she thinks the can-
didates for this election have more
focused goals for MSA than in
years past, which she said should
make the debate more interesting.

the team are "deeply saddened" by
the news of Davidson's death.
"He's been a great owner who
genuinely cared for players, coach-
es and employees," Curry wrote.
"He will not only be remembered
as a great owner but also as a per-
son who made a difference in many
people's lives. Our thoughts and
prayers are with Mrs. D and the
entire Davidson family."
When Davidson was inducted
into the Basketball Hall of Fame in
September, Pistons President Joe
Dumars said Davidson was a great
man, the Detroit News reported:
"It was just a great, great, great
comfort for me to know I had
someone who was the owner of
the Pistons who just epitomized
everything you wanted in a great
owner: incredible character, hon-
est, straightforward," Dumars said.
"When someone is a trailblazer, a
risk-taker, an innovator, that per-
son should be recognized. If any
person deserves to be in there (in
the Hall of Fame), it's this guy right
here. It's Bill Davidson."

the University just recently announced the creation of a film office
to assist studios interested in making movies on campus. With the
state economy floundering, the Ann Arbor bubble can only remain
intact for so long. Encouraging filmmakers to choose Ann Arbor is
a great way to stimulate the local economy. In addition to this, the
film office should also work with studios to create more opportuni-

Rewriting the books

The University has been swamped with
requests for filming on campus following
the passage of the Michigan Motion Picture
Incentive Program last spring. This pro-
gram offers a 40 percent tax credit to large
filmmaking projects in Michigan, allowing
studios to cut back on cast, crew and other
production costs. Since this incentive went
into effect, there has been a spike in filming
around the state, including in Ann Arbor,
and plans for Michigan-based studios have
already been proposed. The University's
new office, while not a profitable endeavor,
hopes to streamline the process for film-
makers to shoot on campus.
The most beneficial part of encourag-
ing film 'production in Ann Arbor is the
economic boon a large movie production
would bring to the community. The local
support system that comes with the arrival
of a large film crew stimulates local busi-
nesses. Unless these crews plan on living
in tents and eating canned food, increased
patronage at local bars, restaurants and
hotels will result from the arrival of film
crews in the city.
But the University's new film office
should make an effort not only to help
filmmakers obtain access to University

locations for shooting, but also to encour-
age the hiring of arts majors seeking a
career in the film industry. Not only does
this help retain Michigan students in need
of.jobs, but it also keeps breathing life into
Ann Arbor's cultural identity - one that
already includes the Ann Arbor Film Festi-
val - by keeping young, talented artists of
various kinds in the city despite economic
woes statewide. Motivated filmmakers,
artists and performers have the chance
to take advantage of the opportunities at
their doorstep.
The effort to bring in filmmakers should
also be considered an investment in the
University's exposure. Film crews find out
how great the University community is and
audiences across the country get a glimpse
of what it means to go to school here.
University officials are making the
right move to help establish Ann Arbor as
a hot spot for movie material. While not
every movie made in Ann Arbor will be an
award-winning masterpiece, the increased
presence of the film industry in the city
is an encouraging bright spot for those
who wish to use the creative talents they
learned at the University without leaving
the area.

I have always been Christian and religious. I can't
remember a time when I'didn't believe in God. I grew up
in a conservative Presbyterian church that had a "love the
sinner, hate the sin" attitude toward homosexuality, so
when I came out to myself as queer at 16, 1 was devastated.
At first, I considered celibacy, which was my church's only
answer to homosexuality. I would have done it if I had
been sure it was what God wanted, but something nagged
at my brain. How could it be a sin? Who was I hurting?
Why would God have made me queer if I was supposed to
spend my whole life fighting it? I considered fighting it for
a while and then started looking for other options.
I found out that a lot of denominations, my own includ-
ed, have groups of churches that accept lesbian, gay,
bisexual, transgender and queer people without asking
us to change. I visited all different kinds of churches:
Methodist, Lutheran, United Church of Christ and Pres-
byterian. I began to believe that homosexuality was not
a sin - that God loves and accepts people regardless of
their sexuality. Jesus, after all, said nothing about homo-
sexuality and spenthis time with all sorts of people on the
fringes of society.
Still, I had considered getting ordained for a long time,
and if that was what God was asking of me, I wanted a
church in which I could get ordained without having to
be celibate. This narrowed my search down to the Epis-
copal, Unitarian Universalist and Metropolitan Commu-
nity Churches. I tried a local Episcopal Church and fell in
love almost instantly. Sexuality was talked about openly,
I was allowed to be a Sunday school teacher and the priest
herself wss in a committed, same-sex relationship. I was
confirmed into the Episcopal Church in June of 2009 and
it felt like coming home.
Coming to college, I was afraid I wouldn't find a reli-
gious community that accepted me the way my first
church had. By the grace of God, I found two: Canterbury

House and St. Clare of Assisi Episcopal Church. The first
time I met St. Clare's parishioners was at an Oasis Even-
song, a service held once a month by and for LGBT people
and our allies. They encouraged me to visita service at St.
Clare's, and sure enough, it me feel at home the moment I
walked through the door.
At Canterbury House, the Episcopal student ministry,
I found another terrific community. The music is wild,
the preaching is radical and you will be welcomed into
the community no matter where you are in life. In it I
have found a Christian community of LGBT people and
our allies. I've gained countless Christian friends, some
LGBT and others straight.
Robin Williams once joked that the best thing about
the Episcopal Church is that, whatever you believe, you
are sure to find someone there who will agree with you.
In some ways, he's right - certainly not everyone in the
Episcopal Church believes LGBT people should be accept-
ed into the life of the-church, and we are still struggling
over whether LGBT people should be bishops. I love the
fact that we can disagree civilly (most of the time), but I
wish everyone could see what I see - LGBT Christians
pray, laugh, cry, worship, work and raise families in the
church just like everyone else.
LGBT people are an integral part of the church. We
have a powerful presence in the life of the church and we
belong in its sacred space as much as anyone else. Cer-
tainly, we have come a long way, but there's still much
more to do. Although it won't be easy, I truly believe that
LGBT people in all faiths have the responsibility of work-
ing to advance our cause in organized religion. We too are
faithful people, and we too deserve the chance to be wel-
comed into our religions the way we are. It's bound to be
an uphill battle, but I know we'll get there.

Give me discs,
not downloads

There's something beau-
tiful about a compact
disc. First, there's its
circular shape, which symbolizes
the unending -
cycle of death,
rebirth and a
life of gaming.
Then there's its
art, a teaser of
the wondrous
beauties to be JMSr E
witnessed upon BLOCK
a game's instal-
lation; the physical solidity of the
thing - the fact that you can hold
a disc in your hand and just stare
at it for a minute, letting the feel-
ing sink in: "This game is gonna
be fucking awesome."
But games on discs are slowly
becoming obsolete. The first
things to go are expansion packs,
which, especially on consoles, are
starting to be available exclusively
as downloads. Something just
doesn't feel right about this. The
vicious behemoth some blindly
call "the Internet" is already
devouring physical, paper-bound
books as we know them. Why
does it have to prey on games, too?
Now, the matter is obviously
different for games than it is for
books. When a book is put online,
the format in which people read
it changes. Yet no matter how you
go about buying the game, you
still play it on the same screen.
What the disappearance of the
disc means for gamers is an end
to the wondrous process of buy-
ing a video game and anticipating
playing it.
Some of my favorite childhood
moments were spent in Best Buy.
I would rush into the store and
make a mad dash for the game
I wanted. Once I got my grubby
little fingers on it, I would turn
it over in my hands, reading
every single letter printed on the
shiny and colorful new hox, right
down to the distribution info and
seizure warnings. Once I had
scanned it thoroughly, I would
walk up and down the aisles
looking at the vast array of other
games and watching the bigger
kids play demos, all the while
clutching the box tightly to make
sure nobody tried to steal it.
.As soon as we got back to the
car - if I could wait that long - I
would rip off the plastic and open
the box, finally beholding the disc
itself. As I did with the box's text,
I would diligently scour every
page of the instruction booklet,
stopping only when we got home
and I could finally experience the
game first-hand. These were fun
times.
But today's youth are simul-
taneously spoiled and deprived
by their own impatience. Sure,
when you download a game right
to your system you can play it
right away, but where's the fun in
that? Nobody plays any one game

forever, so it's not like you're los-
ing any play time by going on an
adventure to the store to pick the
game up yourself.
Also, the last thing gamers need
is a way to become even more
sedentary. In the world of yester-
year, you could always buy a game
on Amazon.com.without leaving
your house. But at least you had
to get off the couch and go over to
the computer. And then, when the
game arrived, you had to open the
door to get it, possibly even get-
ting some much-needed fresh air
in the process.
But there's also an economic
aspect to those sneaky game pub-
lishers' decision to move online:
They're killing the used game
market. Sure, you'll still be able
to sell your old Xbox and Game-
cube games, but for how long?
As newer systems come out, the
market for retro gamingbecomes
narrower and narrower. And the
older the system, the harder it is
to find a functioning console.
Games that are downloaded
can't be bought and sold after
the initial purchase. They're on
Taking games
out of stores
takes the heart
out of games.
.your hard drive, and that's where
they're staying. It's a sinisterly
clever move by the game compa-
nies, who are basically assuring
themselves financially by mak-
ing everyone who wants to play
a game on their own console by
their own copy. You can't even
horrow from a friend anymore.
The advent of the downloadable
game is going to have unforesee-
able consequences on stores like
GameSpot and the local Get Your
Game On, so I won't attempt to
foresee their futures with any
particular degree of specificity.
But suffice it to say this: A store
that sells video games will have a
hard time making it when video
games are no longer sold in stores.
Duh.
Whether you're a retro kid
like me who thinks that discs
and game boxes are just plain
pretty or a hardcore gamer who's
worried that he won't be able to
mooch his friend's copy of the
next "Grand Theft Auto," there's
something just plain wrong about
selling games solely via down-
load. Besides, the Internet is
probably just a fad.

School in France: Pretty good actuall

At the top of its class

'The Class' offers a gritty,
realistic view of teaching in
inner-city schools
By ANDREW LAPIN
Daily Film Editor
The line between truth and fiction is expertly
manipulated in "The Class," a
French docudrama that won
the Golden Palm at last year's
Cannes Film Festival. The class
The film is about the teach-
er of an inner-city middle At the
school in Paris and his stu- Michigan
dents, who hail from several Sony
different racial and socioeco-
nomic backgrounds. Director Laurent Cantet

("Heading South") achieves an incredible sense
of realism for a scripted film, thanks to constant
improvisation, use of non-professional actors
and fly-on-a-wall filmmaking techniques. "The
Class" will transport even the most jaded view-
ers back to the trials and turmoil of their middle
school years.
The source material for the film is a 2006
semi-autobiographical novel by former teacher
Francois Begaudeau. Begaudeau co-wrote the
screenplay and stars as the teacher in "The
Class" who is also named Francois.
His students are played by the real-life stu-
dents at the school where the movie was filmed.
The students gave up five weeks of their sum-
mer vacation to sit in a cramped classroom and
be filmed yelling at their "teacher." When kids
are sacrificing their vacations in the name of
higher art, something magical must be at work.
The students' parents in the film, who make

brief appearances during parent-teacher confer-
ences, also play themselves. Their scenes high-
light ever-present cultural borders between
teacher and parent - when Frangois attempts
to tell one mother about her boy's troublemak-
ing habits, he is distraught to find she doesn't
speak French.
For its first half, "The Class" refuses to devel-
op a coherent storyline, instead dealing frankly
with the many issues that present themselves
in the educational system. In focusing on little
details like the effort it takes Francois to quiet
his students at the start of class every day, "The
Class" further cements its status as a refresh-
ingly realistic tale about the educational sys-
tem. There are no angel-like.Robin Williams or

investment team meets with fund
managers and investors, learns
about their investment strategies
and decides whether or not to work
with that fund. If the University
decides to work with these groups,
its investors commit initial money
to the fund. Unlike stocks or bonds,
however, venture capital and pri-
vate equity commitments usually
span multiple years and sometimes
more than a decade, meaning Uni-
versity investors can't simply yank
their money out of a fund if they so
desired.

team has sought to increase the
percentage of the endowment made
up of venture capital and private
equity investments.
But venture capital and private
equity, too, have suffered losses of
3 percent and almost 10 percent,
respectively, as of Sept. 30. (The most
recent data for the endowment's illiq-
uid assets is Sept. 30 because of a lag
time in calculating illiquid asset val-
ues; liquid assets, on the other hand,
are easier to calculate.)'
The -last two illiquid buckets in
the endowment are real estate and

nearly 21 percent.
The endowment also hasa "cash"
bucket containing cash holdings,
which comprised over 3 percent of.
the endowment as of Dec. 31.
While stocks, bonds and "abso-
lute return" investments are con-
sidered liquid assets - meaning
they can be converted more quickly
and easily into cash - the rest of
the endowment consists of illiquid
assets, which are often investments
in longer term partnerships and
agreements.
Venture capital and private equi-
ty investments - together making
up almost 23 percent of the endow-
ment as of Dec. 31, according to the
February investment filing - are
two types of illiquid investments.
In the case of venture capital
and private equity, the University's

"So the investment period is for
four years," Lundberg explained.
During that period, the fund or
group will "go out and buy a com-
pany, or they'll go out and start
companies, or they will go out and
sponsor entrepreneurs and help
them grow their companies. ... And
when the company's ready, they'll
take it public or they'll sell it to
another company, and then we get
our money back. But it may take 10,
in some cases up to 15 years, from
when the fund starts until it ends."
Historically, the venture capital
and private equity buckets have-
reaped rewards for the endow-
ment, reporting 3- and 5-year
returns anywhere from 16 percent
to 26 percent, according to the 2008
Report of Investments. Not surpris-
ingly, the University's investment

energyinvestments,whichtogether
comprise around 27 percent of the
endowment as of Dec. 31, according
to the February investment filing.
Real estate investments involve
endowment funds being invested
in real estate managers through-
out the United States and the world
who identify property development
opportunities such as buying office
and residential properties and then
improving and reselling them for a
profit.
Though profitable in past years,
real estate investments included in
the endowment have suffered loss-
es of about 7 percent as of Sept. 30.
The final bucket is the endow-
ment's energy investments. The

gas fields that are declining in pro-
duction and use advanced extrac-
tion methods to make those oil and
gas fields produce more.
"They maybe drill a few more
wells, but the whole idea is there's
proven oil and gas reserves in there,
and their goal is to get out more
than what the seller could've'gotten
out knowing what they do," Lund-
berg said.
Though the 'energy bucket had
posted a 13-percent loss as of Sept.
30, the endowment's energy invest-
ments reported an astounding 61
percent return in the 2008 fiscal
year, on the back of record oil and
gas prices in the first half of 2008.
On top of that, the energy 'bucket
has recorded 3-year returns of 47
percent and 5-year returns of 56
percent, according to the 2008
Report of Investments.
THE UNIVERSITY'S
FINANCIAL GUARDIANS
Other colleges and universi-
ties with multi-billion-dollar
endowments often employ mas-
sive investment teams - Harvard
Management Company, which
oversees the school's endowment,
pension assets and other invest-
ments, employs over 200 people,
and the University of Texas Sys-
tem's management company has
almost 60 employees listed on its
website.
The University of Michigan
Investment' Office, ' located in
downtown Ann Arbor, is a bit more
tight-knit.
The University's investment
team consists of 12 financial ana-
lysts and three administrative
staff members. Heading that team
is Lundberg, a Norwegian native
and former analyst and invest-
ment strategist for phone company
Ameritech, who started the Univer-
sity Investment Office in 1999.
Prior to the onset of the current
financial crisis last fall, Lundberg
andhisteamhadenjoyedimpressive
returns over the past decade, having
helped, alongside impressive Uni-
versity fundraising efforts, to grow
the endowment from $2.5 billion in
1999 to $7.6 billionby June30.
As a result, Institutional Investor
magazine named Lundberg one of
its "Excellence in Investment Man-
agement" award winners in 2007.
Lundberg also earns one of the top
base salaries at the University, hav-
ing made $426,000oin2006 and 2007
and $491,000 in 2008, according to
annualUniversity salary data.
Although the investment team
oversees the direction, strategy
and performance of the school's
endowment, University analysts
don't actually do the buying and-
selling. Instead, outside investment
groups, who partner with the Uni-
versity Investment Office, make the
actual investment transactions.
"Our job is to put together the
composition of the aggregate port-
folio, like deciding how much we
should have in stocks and bonds,
and then all of these different asset
classes," Lundberg explained, "and
then go out and say (to outside
investment groups), 'Populate that
(portfolio composition) with the
best of breed outthere."'
Coming up with the most profit-
able investment strategy isn't solely
theresponsibilityoftheUniversity's
investment team, either. As Lund-
berg said, "It's not just me sitting in
my corner office here looking at the
world saying, 'Hey, this is what we
should be doing."'

Integral to the investment team's
strategy is the advice of the Univer-
sity's Investment Advisory Com-
mittee. An eight-member group of
investment veterans, the commit-
tee's members include directors at
institutions like Goldman Sachs
and Bain Capital and individuals
whose specialties range from ven-
ture capital to private equity to
other kinds of investments. (For
a list of the Investment Advisory
Commitee's members, go to michi-
gandaily.com.)
Committee members meet with
the University's investment team
severaltimes a year, offering advice
on what kinds of investments they
think would benefit the endow-
ment and other strategic advice for
investing the University's money.
'The Investment Advisory Com-
mittee has been widely praised.
After participating in one of the
committee's meetings, Charlie
Munger, the vice chairman of the
venerable 'Berkshire Hathaway
Corporation and a former Univer-
sity student, said it was the best
investment committee he had ever
seen of its type, recalled committee
member Sanford Robertson.
Lundberg also praised the com-
mittee, describing it as "a very good
sounding board, (offering) very
good advice, sound advice."
Lundberg also emphasized that
other parts of the University help
with various aspects of managing
the endowment. The University
Controller's Office, for example,
continually tracks the endowment's
investments for the Investment
Office, Lundbergsaid.
"We rely very heavily on other
parts of the University to do our
job," he said.

ARIES
(March 21 toApril 19)
This is an up-and-down day. You're
very restless. You want adventure and
something different, but somehow, this
doesn't click with your job and your pri-
vate life. Frustrating!
TAURUS
(April 20 to May 20)
This is a poor day to make major deci-
sions about shared property or anything
having to do with inheritances, insurance
matters, taxes or debt. You feel pulled in
two directions.
GEMINI
(May 21to June 20)
Discussions with partners and close
friends are bit challenging today. Bosses
or parents cotld be critical. It's not all
bad; however, it's not all good, either.
CANCEL
(June 21 toJuly 22)
Be extra patient with co-workers
today. It's easy to feel mildly annoyed
about a lot of things. Fortunately, in
between these hangnail moments, there
are a few rainbows. (Whew!)
LEO
(July 23 to Aug.. 22)
Romance is touchy today. You might
feet at adds with your main squeeze.
Teaching ortaking care of children could
be a bit exasperating. But really, none of
this is a big deal.
VIRGO
(Aug. 23 to Sept. 22)
Conversations with family members
and people you live with, as well as
close friends, are all a bit dicey today.
It's minor stuff, but it's there. Just be
cool.
LIBRA'
(Sept. 23 to Oct. 22)
Make sure you are concentrating when
driving or doing any kind of mental
work. You might feel impatient with rou-
tine details. Don't push yourself too hard
today.

SCORPIO
(Oct. 23 to Nov. 21)
Be patient with children today. Be
extra careful with money matters, espe-
cially related to sporting events, hotels,
theme parks and vacations. Keep your
receipts.
SAGITTARIUS
(Nov. 22 to Dec. 21)
The Moon is in your sign today; how-
ever, it's challenged by Mercury and
Saturn. The good news is your ruler,
Jupiter, arrives tothe rescue! Ta da! This
creates moments of impatience inter-
spersed with laughter.
CAPRICORN
(Dec. 22to Jan. 19)
Remind yourself that your glass is
half-full, not half-empty. The fact that
you're reading this column shows you're
in a fortunate segment of the population
on planet Earth.
AQUARIUS
(Jan. 20 to Feb. 18)
You might have financial concerns
today. (Join the club - we number mil-
lions.) Curb your expenses right now.
Stay under the radar.
PISCES
(Feb. 19 to March 20)
Be gracious while talking to parents
and bosses today. Things can gokwell,
hut there are a few snags. Look foe
win/win scenarios, because they do
exist.
YOU BORN TODAY Movement
through dance, aviation and travel attract
you. You like activity, and you like to be
involved, especially with a noble cause.
You flit from one thing to another seek-
ing stimulation, and offering your sym-
pathy and talent where possible. You
don't like to be pinned down! You're
modern and cutting-edge. Work hard to

uncooperative and unruly, and the school proves itself
many times to be ill-equipped for dealing with them.
Eventually a story emerges around Souleymane
(newcomer Franck Keita), a loudmouth Malian stu-
dent who is threatened with expulsion after a heated
exchange of insults in the classroom spirals out of
control. What complicates matters is that Frangois is
not a complete bystander in the situation; there is a
possibility that the frank and unorthodox methods he
uses to speak to his students caused him to overstep
his boundaries.
Theviewer isultimatelyleft tojudge whatthe proper
course of action should hdve been, and the decision is
not an easy one. Souleymane's story is an embodiment
of the disconnect between students' personal lives and

unbearably memorable tune is an earworm worth let-
ting in.
The album hits an early low point on the laughable
"47," with its fragmented melody and embarrassing
refrain of "I called you 46 times /And you answered on
the 47th." The awkward lyrics and disjointed rhythm
make "47" Fight's least worthy offering.
n The band hits the road with overzealous guitars
and double-kick drums on "Truck Stop Blues." The
song nearly spins out of control until a toe-tapping
chorus grooves its way into a reflection on the way
"highways and telephone lines" are the only things
connecting touring rock stars with their loved ones.
This . simplistic but lasting metaphor is certainly
nothing new from a road-worn band, but lead singer
Jordan Pundik's sincere croon deserves an empathet-
ic response.
"I'll Never Love Again" showcases guitarist Chad

their teachers' strike-hard-and-fast disciplinary phi-
losophy. And there are many unanswered questions
about what would have been tfe best way to approach
Souleymane's situation.
The original French title of "The Class" - and the title
of the novel from which it is based - is "Entre Les Murs,"
which translates to "Between the Walls." It's a fitting
description, as the vast majority of the film takes place
within the walls of Frangois's classroom. The cramped
space provides a revealing look at how students inter-
pret the world. In one instance, a black girl rightfully
chastises Frangois for only using "white" names during
his grammar lessons; in another, a discussion of soccer
teams devolves into a flurry of racial stereotyping.
Despite all the drama, by the end of the school year
many students have learned from Frangois and from
each other. "The Class" is thankfully just optimis-
tic enough to suggest that most of them have bright
futures in their sights.
Gilbert's shredding skills, which complement Pundik's
devastating lament on the prospect of rio longer being
able to partake in relationships. "Reasons," a con-
trast to its predecessor, follows by opening with an
easy acoustic line that fades into the background as a
confrontational Pundik informs, "You can cut off my
tongue / I'm speechless / and -I'm wasting away / to
nothing at your feet."
Not Without a Fight solidifies NFG's position on top
of the pop-punk throne, The guitar-driven.tunes have
an angst and energy that were hardly perceptible on
its predecessor, the more pretentious, piano-plagued
Coming Home. Reverting back to the sound heard on
Sticks andStones (NFG's most commerciallysuccessful
effort) has worked in the band's favor. The members of
NFG are not musical geniuses, but their emotive songs
continue to serve the purpose of entertaining and
sharing common feelings with a loyal fan base.
It's no secret that pop punk's glory days have long
since passed. But NFG refuses to be another casualty
of a vanishing genre. New Found Glory shows no sign
of slowing down now - at least not without a fight.

"It's just upward going forw

Beilein has made'M a*
" Tournament contender

This bid was
for the fans, too

By RUTH LINCOLN
Daily Sports Editor
John Beilein jumped out of his large leather chair,
embraced his wife and children to his right and ran on
to his jubilant players.
The man who had just been hiding his inevitable
nerves, sitting calmly, with his legs crossed and left
hand sitting reassuringly on the back of redshirt fresh-
man Laval Lucas-Perry's chair, was ecstatic.
With hundreds of screaming fans in Crisler Arena,
Michigan men's basketball coach had just led his team
to sometbing huge - its first NCAA Tournament berth
since 1998.
When Beilein first met wiih his players in April 2007,
he brought theNCAA Sweet 16 and Elite Eight rings he
earned at West Virginia to share. As each player slid the
rings on and off, Beilein's message was clear:
"We're going to put these on as soon as we can,"
Beilein said through the Athletic Department in 2007.
"NCAA rings, we're going to go. after it as soon as we
can. There's no timetable. Just do your .best, and our
coaching staff and everyone will do the best they can,
as well."
That was 534 days ago. It has been 11 years since

Michigan's last Tournament appearance. On Thursday
at 7:10 p.m., that will change.
Yesterday, Michigan became a legitimate Tourna-
ment team. And Beilein deserves a lot of the credit.
HE'5.BEEN EVERYWHERE
Thirty. years of head coaching experience speaks
pretty loudly, and 26 winning seasons is even clearer.
Never as an assistant, Beilein has learned how to
win as a head coach at all levels - community college,
NCAA Division II, and for the last 17 years, Division-I.
In April 2007, after six seasons under former-Michi-
gan coach Tommy Amaker and no NCAA Tournament
bids, Michigan Athletic Director Bill Martin brought in
someone with a winner's resume.
.Known as a true teacher, Beilein directed his pro-
grams to greatness with a quirky offensive system
and an ability to make seemingly average players into
household names.
"John Beilein can win at whatever level you put him
at and still maintain the integrity of the institution and
the integrity of his program," said John.Maddock, an
associate athletic director at Canisius who served on
the Canisius search committee that helped hire Beilein.
See BEILEIN, Page 4B

T he numbers didn't matter anymore.
. Eight seed, 10 seed, 12 seed, 16 seed - no
one cared as hundreds of fans nervously.
stared at the Crisler Arena Jumbotron and waited for
the announcement'that was 11 years in the making.
With each successive bubble
team called --Arizona, Minne-
sota, Southern California, Mary-
land - the drama built up, doubt
growing in every mind. Fifth-
year-senior guard C.J. Lee sat in
a plush chair, hands held-in front
of his face as if he were praying.
Michigan coach John Beilein
slumped in his seat, scowling and ANDY
shaking his head for every brack- REID
et that didn't feature Michigan's
name. Fans rubbed their temples
and booed other selections.
The Midwest, the West and the East brackets
were called first. The tense murmurs and "what ifs"
started to buzz throughthe crowd.
Then it happened.
The Michigan men's basketball team was extend-
ed an invitation to participate in the NCAA Tourna-

ment.
It was great for the players, who celebrated as if it
had just made the Big Dance for the first time in more
than a decade - oh, wait - bt yesterday was about
more than the players and coaches.
It's about the eight fans who have.frequently
painted themselves to spell out "MICHIGAN,"-even
during the 10-22 debacle last.year.
It's about senior Vince Coughlin, Super Fan and
head of the Maize Rage club, who probably hasn't
missed a home tennis match in his four years inAnn
Arbor, let alone a basketball game.
It's about William Austin, a CrislerArena usher
for 26 years, who can't remember too many moments
as.special as this one. He'd be going to Kansas City if
he didn't have to fulfill his professional obligations at
the Michigan baseball games this weekend.
It's about cheerleaders and band members and
season ticket holders. Team managers, marketing.
representatives, alumni who watch every game from
their couches, and ex-team members who played
through four years of Tournament-less seasons.
It's simply about everyone who has a vested inter-
est in this team. It was a long time coming.

Michigan's collapse
in desert series
By TIM ROHAN
Daily Sports Writer
Last weekend, the Michigan
baseball team was played the New
York Mets,'a professional team. This
weekend against 'Arizona, it just
seemed that way.
The Wolverines (10-5), who
hadn't been shut out since May 16 vs.
Northwestern, were held scoreless
twice over the weekend en roite
to being swept in a three-game
weekend series at Arizona (11-7).
Michigan kept Friday and ,Satur-
day's games close, when Michigan
losing 2-0 and 9-7, romped Arizona
romped in-a14-0 win on Sunday.
Michigan coach Rich Maloney
said he expected th6 offense to
struggle coming into the season and
the pitchiig and defense to carry
the Wolverines. But that. has not
been the case, as the offense. has
been a great surprise.
The 25th-ranked Wplverines are
batting .316 as. a team so far this
season - a point below last season's
final average. Michigan's defense
had struggled before this weekend
with 17 errors on the season, but
didn't have a single one against
Arizona. But the usually effective
pitching staff allowed 43 baserun-
ners.
Michigan didn't have many pleas-
ant surprises over the weekend.
"(I'm) very, very disappointed,"
Maloney said. "We don'tlike losing.
I don't care who we're playing. Lose
three games and ... quite frankly,
they embarrassed us, they played.so
well. We don't like. taking a whup-
pin' like that. So we'll work real hard-
so that doesn't happen again."
The series was a chance for
Michigan to seek revenge. A 4-3
.defeat to the Wildcats was one of
the two losses that eliminated the
Wolverines from -last year's NCAA
Regional. .
The team has changed consid-
erably since then. In .that.game,
then-freshman centerfielder Ryan
LaMarre was batting in the ninth
position. This season, he is batting
third, and his 10-game hittingstreak
was snapped on Sunday.
$enior Chris Fetter started the
opening game of the series and
pitched into the eighth inning, giv-
ing up just two runs, one of which
came on a passed ball in the fifth

Just like last year, the Wol-

time, it isn't as scary. Redshirt

practice..

Forcier has been hyped as the
quarterback Rodriguez was look-
ing for all last season, and the
coach didn't bother to hide his
excitement over Forcier and the
team's six other early enrollees.
"The nice thing'about it is
I think they've really blended
into our program," Rodriguez
said.,"They've not tried to be out
front and brag about themselves.
They know they have to earn the
respect, and I think they've tried
to do it. I'm tickled to death the
way they worked so far."
But'a quarterback can't be good
without a solid offensive line,
which was one of the Wolverines'
-biggest issues last year.
Rodriguez said Saturday he

Saturday he might have 10 poten-

most embarrassing weaknesses

This spring, Rodriguez said
he thinks the Wolverines can
hold outdoor practices for the
first three or four sessions--
.,and that up to half of practices
may be spent working on special
teams. In just the first half'hour
of Saturday's practice, the Wol-
verines worked on kick returns,
punt returns and blocking
punts.
Last yearstarting from that
first spring practice, it often felt
like Rodriguez and some of the

other coaches were just putting on

That quickly vanished during
Michigan's five-game midseason
