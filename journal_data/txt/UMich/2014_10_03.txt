one week after sophomore
quarterback Shane Morris suf-
fared a concussive hit in the
'Wolverinea' matchup againat
Minnesota, the University Ath-
letic Department has begun to
open up about the incident with
media outlets - including Ath-
letic Director Dave Brandon in
an interview with The Michigan
Daily Thursday.
In addition to Brandon, Uni-
versity President Mark Schlissel
and Michigan coach Brady Hoke
have both addressed the media.
However, as of Thursday, there
has been no communication from
any of the eight team physicians
currently contracted with the
football team.
In a 12:30 p.m. Monday press
conference, Hoke told the media

the medical dcpartment would
deliver a statement on Morris'
condition. However, no further
communication was received
until Brandon's 12:52 a.m. state-
ment Tuesday.
Andtherehavebeennofollow-
ups by medical personnel since.
Attempts by The Michigan
Daily since early Wednesday to
contact the team's eight physi-
cians yielded no responses. Two
of the eight declined comment -
one citing his desire to not com-
ment on the work performed by
colleagues - while the other
six did not respond to interview
requests.
In addition to their roles with
the Athletic Department, seven
of the team physicians hold a
professorship in the University
of Michigan Health System. Each
holds a medical degree, unlike
the athletic trainers and athletic
medicine staff.
Jeffrey Kutcher, the football
team's neurologist, has been
widely credited as a leader in
concussion research and safety.
His prominence in sports medi-
cine landed him a place as one of
the Team USA physicians for the
2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi,

the fourth quarter of Saturday's
football game against Minneso-

for another play after takingthe
hit and was later reinserted for
another snap, apparently not
undergoing evaluation for head
trauma.
According to NCAA policy,
a player must be removed from
the game immediately if he
shows any sign of a concussion.
But Hoke has maintained that
he, other coaches and medical
personnel did not see the inci-

Brandon said he doesn't
know how Hoke eventually
learned of the concussion. As of
Monday afternoon's press con-
ference, the coach had claimed
he was only aware of Morris'

"That was just another exam-

among of the doctors, all of the
trainers - in this case, the head

Romney campaigns for
Michigan GOP candidates

Republicans
gather support
before upcoming
midterm election
By SHOHAM GEVA
Daily StaffReporter
LIVONIA - A slate of
statewide Republican rallies
received a boost Thursday
morning when former Repub-
lican presidential candidate
Mitt Romney visited the state
for a rally a little more than one
month before Election Day.
Romney, a Michigan native
who lost the state by 450,000
votes in the 2012 presidential
election, spoke at Laurel Manor
in Livonia in support of mul-

tiple GOP candidates, namely
U.S. senatorial candidate Terri
Lynn Land (R) and Michigan
Attorney General Bill Schuette
(R), who is running for reelec-
tion. Both have been within
single-digit margins in recent
polls with their opponents.
Before Thursday's engage-
ment, Romney visited Colo-
rado, which, like Michigan,
features several tight statewide
races.
Republican Gov. Rick Sny-
der, who is running to maintain
his seat in another major state-
wide election, was absent from
the rally. He hosted a campaign
town hall Thursday evening in
Sterling Heights.
"As many of you know, this
could not be amore criticalyear
for Michigan," Michigan GOP
Chairman Bobby Schostak told

the crowd to kick off the event.
"Michigan Republicans have
been working diligently the
past four years to put Michigan
back on the road to recovery."
Romney spoke to the crowd
about his Michigan roots, and
said he enjoyed visiting the
state because of the connec-
tions many of his family mem-
bers have with it, including his
father, a former governor who
served between 1963 and 1969.
. "I have family here, and I
feel like you're family," Rom-
ney said. "I appreciate the
support of people in this great
state."
He said he supports Land
because of the contrast she
represents to the policies of
President Barack Obama and
Senate Majority Leader Harry

One of Ann Arbor's fledgling
startups is looking to vault its com-
petition by creating an easier, more
social way of storing students'
valuables. Its motto: "Your closet
away from home."
The goal of Vaultd, co-founded
by LSA senior Mikey Shen and
Engineering junior Brett Mecham,
is to provide low-cost storage,
in addition to free drop-off and
pickup capabilities, to students
throughout the year. Shen said
there are currently few storage
facilities in Ann Arbor.
"The options here are pretty.
limited," Shen said. "They do have
self-storage things that are around
here, but most of my friends are
paying a couple hundred dollars a
month for storing whatever!"
Shen said his idea for more
affordable storage came during his
freshman year, when he noticed
how expensive it was for his out-
of-state friends -and international
students to store their belongings
over the summer. He ultimately
started the company in April 2014.

Grant for. Detroit transit
should improve access

Federal and state
money to bring 50
new buses to city
By NEALA BERKOWSKI
Daily StaffReporter
New federal money for the
Detroit Department of Transpor-
tation offers an opportunity to
improve the city's bus system.
Detroit was granted nearly $26
million by the Federal Transit
Administration last Thursday - a
grant that was partially matched
by state funds for a total of $32.3
million. The money went toward
the purchase of 50 new city buses,
said Megan Owens, executive
director of Transportation Riders
United.
"The Federal Department of
Transportation provides support
for purchasing new buses regu-
larly and the secretary of trans-
portation said that Detroit made
-HU

a compelling case that they have
a real need to increase their bus
fleets," Owens said. "There was
about $100 million available
nationally and Detroit got about
$26 million, which is pretty sub-
stantial."
She said Detroit will receive
its buses in the next six to 18
months. Owens explained this
implementation time is typical,
because the city has to work out
the logistics of contracts and of
manufacturing the buses before
they arrive.
"Another nice thing is that the
city was able to repurpose some
other funds that they had to pur-
chase another 30 buses," Owens
said. "Those are already on order
and they're hoping to have -at
least some of those buses running
before the end of the year. Alto-
gether, gaining another 80 buses
over the next year or so should
provide a big help to the city,
improving its reliability."
One third of Detroit house-
H-m

holds do not have a car and rely
on buses, biking and walking, she
said. Detroit's transportation sys-
tem is unreliable in part because
there are not enough buses run-
ning to meet current schedule
requirements. The current sched-
ule requires about.225 buses, but
there are only 180 buses in the
city's fleet.
"There are bus routes that just
don't have a bus operating and
there's no way for the passengers
to know that; say, Woodward is
supposed to have six buses oper-
ating on it in order to handle the
20,000 people a day who ride,
but if they only have four buses
that day, the buses get very over-
crowded and get behind," Owens
said. "It really makes a lot of peo-
ple late."
Daniel Spyker, associate mem-
ber of the Consumer Family
Adversary Council of the Detroit
Wayne County Community Men-
tal Health Agency, has been riding
city buses as many as six times per
day for the last 32 years. He said
the bus system is undependable
and not accessible for those with
mental health disabilities.
"I would say as far as perfor-
mance, my view of the city buses is
unfavorable for me and the people
I work with," Spyker said. "People
can't get to their jobs or job inter-
views on time and miss doctor's
appointments."
Unlike major Midwestern cit-
ies like Chicago, Detroit does not
have a sales tax on transportation,
Owens said. Cuts have been made'
to transportation over the last
decade as Detroit struggled with
its finances and decides how to
distribute its scarce dollars, lead-
ing to inadequate transportation
services.
"The amount that the city has
allocated has dropped to half over
the last six or eight years," Owens
said. "They used to be spending
$80 to $90 million every year to
run a transit system for the city.
Now that's closer to $50 million.
And so that's one of the big chal-
lenges, that there is no money that
automatically goes to the transit

STARTUP
From Page 1
Shen and Mecham began work-
ing with one another through
"Startup Academy," an annual
event put on by entrepreneur-
ship-focused student organiza-
tion MPowered. There, Shen said,
Mecham helped him explore the
idea of renting out self-storage and
catering that to students asa prof-
itable service.
The duo conducted a test run
this summer with a group of
roughly 30 students, selling them
cardboard boxes for a nominal fee
and storing their goods in a small
warehouse space. What made
their services different from other
storage facilities, they said, was
charging students for their boxes
on a monthly basis and not charg-
ing them at all for pickup and
delivery.
The average rate for these
boxes is $10 per month - totaling
roughly $40 for the duration of
summer break.
Now, they are changing their
business model and moving away
from cardboard boxes. Vaultd has
paired with a manufacturer and
has ordered a limited quantity of.
large plastic boxes measuring 24
by22 by12 inches.
"Because we used the card-
board boxes, we found that after
a few months, even in a climate-
controlled facility, between mov-

ing and transporting stuff, and
stacking the boxes on top of each
other, they just kind of got warped
and damaged," Mecham said.
"With plastic bins, they're a lot
more sturdy, they're waterproof
... you can even zip-tie them," he
added.
Vaultd's main competitor as of
this moment, it seems, is John's
Pack and Ship. For its standard,
18-by-18-by-24-inch large box,
the company charges from $55 to
$187.50 for five to eight months of
storage, with the pricing contin-
gent on the weight of the box.
John's Pack and Ship also sells
its own cardboard boxes; each
large box costs $5.
Furthermore, a local self-stor-
age unit, such as Stop 'N Lock,
costs $33 per month for its small-
est locker, which is 5 by5 feet.
Since its summer trial period, in
which Shen and Mecham invested
their personal funds, Vaultd has
received a $5,000 grant from
Grand Rapids startup accelerator
Start Garden. Mecham said the
company will now use this to test
a new theory that students may
even desire extra storage during
the year.
The decision to test this comes
after Vaultd used its capital from
the summer to invest in a larger
storage warehouse in downtown
Ann Arbor, for quick and local
access to students' stored goods.
The hope, after this three-
month trial period, is to re-pitch
their business to Start Garden

for an additional $20,000 invest-
ment. Shen said the company has
also networked with other helpful
local sources through the Univer-
sity's Center for Entrepreneur-
ship, where Mecham works as a
peer advisor.
The duo has attended events
at startup incubator Ann Arbor
SPARK, and was even encouraged
to apply for a grant through a Ross
School of Business commercial-
ization fund.
Another goal of the company
is to expand into a peer-to-peer
storage service by creating a web
- and eventually, mobile - app.
Essentially, Mecham said, Vaultd
wants to set up a social network
through which students can keep
extra items in the homes of local
students and residents willing to
store them on their behalf for a
small fee.
The company would still
charge its standard $10 per box
per month, and would seek com-
mission from the people storing
boxes in their homes. Mecham
said Vaultd has also considered
pairing ridesharing services such
as Uber or Lyft to streamline
delivery and pickup methods as
well as engage more with the Ann
Arbor community.
"We're hoping that this ... one-
size box, flat rate, monthly, will
definitely be able to compete
well," Mecham said. "Especially
with our modernized web and
mobile app, which definitely
appeals to college students."


agency.
Detroit's total area is dispropor-
tionate to its population, which is
now less than 700,000. Population
decline has eroded Detroit's tax
base, leaving less money to devote
to transportation. Detroit's popula-
tion peaked at around 1.8 million
residents in the 1950 census and
has been declining since.
"There is hope that in the next
couple of years there will be a
regional tax on the ballot to help
support an improved regional
transit effort that would improve
regional transit between Detroit'
and Ann Arbor to supplement what
the city is doing and provide some
additional options for people to
get around," Owens said. "We now
have this Regional Transit Author-
ity thatoversees DDOT, Ann Arbor
Transit, SMART and the People

Mover. They're looking for ways to
improve the service."
Owenssaid adding50 new buses
to the fleet is a step in the right
direction for Detroit's transpor-
tation system, but there are still
changes to personnel hiring and
the buses' maintenance that the
city needs to make to permanently
improve its transportation reliabil-
ity.
"They still need to fix their
maintenance so that these buses
can stay in good condition," Owens
said. "Getting new buses and then
not keeping up on them doesn't
help."
When bus drivers quit or retire,
it is hard for the city to find people
to replace them who have experi-
ence, training and can pass drug
testing, Spyker said.
"If a bus breaks down or one

person doesn't come in, the whole
system shakes," Spyker said. "Last
year one of my favorite drivers on
the Livernoisbustold mehissuper-
visor was literally having a stress-
related mental breakdown because
someone didn't show up. When
this happens people just sit around
waiting for the bus to come."
To succeed, Detroit needs reli-
able public transportation for the
people who rely on it, Owens said.
"It's just something that every
city needs to have," Owens said.
"We need to have transportation
options. Everyone of us is one bro-
ken leg away from needing transit
to get where we need to go, but
especially in Detroit ... Ultimately,
Detroiters are never going to be
able to get ahead if they're unable
to get around through reliable
transportation."

said he had not met with Bran-
don since the game. However,
Brandon said, "right after the
game, whenever anyone's injured,
there's immediate discussion, and
the discussion really is centered
around, 'are they OK?'
"The discussion I heard was
that Shane was doing fine," Bran-
don said.
The Athletic Director said he
spent Sunday "getting further
acquainted to what happened on
the sidelines" without Hoke. And
Brandon decided that, at least for
the time being, Hoke will remain
in charge of the football team.
As the person "responsible for
Michigan athletics," Brandon
explained that he made the deci-
sion to release Tuesday morning's
statement, despite Hoke previous-
ly saying itwould come from med-
ical professionals. The Athletic
Director said information learned
throughout the day Monday led to
the release being finalized close to
1a.m.
"The appropriate person in
athletics - and I judged that to
be me - needed to make it very
clear that a mistake Was made,"
Brandon said. "We own it, we rec-
ognize and we acknowledge that
a mistake was made, we apologize
for it - and I did - and we imme-
diately committed that we would
learn from it and make changes
S to ensure that it wouldn't happen
again."
New protocol
Brandon said he is moving for-
ward to improve sideline com-
munication to avoid a situation
"where everybody isn't on the
same page." As a first step, he
said the Athletic Department
will bring in technology the team
has never had before, wiring in
trainers and doctors to be in com-
munication while the game pro-
gresses.
With 110 players on the side-
line spread between the 30-yard.
lines, Brandon's larger goal is
to have his staff connected at in
real-time to process everything.
"There are a lot of voices, a lot
of pak &:ioterpretinginf ma--

we worked really hard to fix, is
to try to bring more protocol and
more process around the whole
communication side of this so,
that we don't get into a situation
where everybody isn't on the
same page."
Brandon's bigger plan is to
insert a medical professional
into the press box, separate from
coordinators and "distractions,"
where they can review each play
in real-time and on a monitor
broadcasting a six-second delay,
all on top of a TV feed of the game
and the stream it displays.
Michigan will implement the
policy as soon as Saturday's game
against Rutgers.
"That provides a couple of
advantages," Brandon said. "He'll
be able to see the field and and see
things occurring that are hard to
see on the sideline. He'll be wired
to the sideline so that he can com-
municate with all those doctors
and trainers in a real-time basis.
He'll have a television set that is
always on a six-second delay. So
what he'll be able to do is watch
the player live from their vantage
point and then he can refer to the
play on television. .
"What I've learned, going
through this process, is that
one of the great advantages we
can provide them, is to get them
wired up in a way they can talk
to one another without hav-
ing to necessarily stand next to
one another, because sometimes
that's difficult."
But that doesn't mean Hoke
will be wearing a headset on the
sideline as a result of the fail-
ure in communication. Brandon
already believes Hoke's commu-
nication is more prevalent than
any other coach he has seen.
Hoke rarely wears a headset
on the sideline, using an assistant
behind him to relay any "infor-
mation that is specific to him,"
according to Brandon.
"That frees him up to better
communicate better with play-
ers," Brandon said. "And that's
just something that coach Hoke
has had as a practice in the way
that he coaches and the way that
he communicates with his play-
ers from the very beginning."
"We've taken some steps that
are both innovative and are
directly addressing the situation
that occuced Saturday in hopes
that something like that is not
going to happen again."

The Obama administration
has delayed a vote on Keystone
XL, a controversial oil pipeline
approved by the Senate Com-
mittee on Energy and Natural
Resources in June, which would
carry oil from Alberta, Canada,
to the Gulf Coast. The ACA, the
signature legislative achievement
of the administration, has been
a similarly salient policy for the
GOP, especially House Republi-
cans, who have voted to repeal it
more than 5o times. The Common

for state K-12 education, has also
received bipartisan scrutiny.

Analysts view Michigan as a
key state that the GOP could flip
in their quest to gain control of the
Senate, following the retirement
of incumbent Sen. Carl Levin (D-
Mich.). However, the Senate race
is now viewed as leaning in favor
of Rep. Gary Peters (D-Mich.), the
Democratic senatorial candidate
who has maintained a consistent
edge over Land during the last
month of the race, according to
recent polls.
Land, who took the stage after
Romney spoke, echoed several of
the same issuesrepeatingapledge
to vote against the ACA and also
pledging to oppose amnesty for
undocumented immigrants.
She pointed to several other
policy areas as additional focuses,
including fixing Michigan's roads,
and criticized both the Demo-
cratic Party and Peters for their
stances on those issues.
"Washington is broken, and
now it's trying to break Michigan,
and we need a senator who's going
to put Michigan first," Land said.
"We've been through some tough
times here, but we're making a
comeback."
Land also called on the state to

provide more options for skilled
workers in the form of grants,
namely for those who choose to
participate in vocational pro-
grams instead of attending four-
year colleges.
"The federal government gives
loans for four-year colleges, but
they leave behind those who don't
attend a university," she said.
The auto industry bailout in
2008, which state Democrats
have criticized Romney and Land
for not supporting, largely went
unmentioned by both speakers,
though a protest by a SuperPAC
outside the venue over the issue
drew roughly 100 people.
Republican candidates for three
of the state's university governing
bodies - Michigan State Universi-
ty, Wayne State University and the
University of Michigan - were
also in attendance at the rally.
Each university's governing board
currently has two open seats.
"We have an opportunity on
our campuses to create more of a
balance ... politically and from a
policy standpoint," Schostak said
before introducingthe candidates.
The University of Michigan's
Board of Regents currently has six

Democrats and two Republicans.
Both seats up for reelection this
year are currently held by Demo-
crats.
Republican candidate Ron
Weiser, a former U.S. ambassador
to Slovakia, stressed several goals,
including reducing tuition and the
financial burden on students after
graduation. Rob Steele, the other
Republican candidate, echoed
this call for fiscal responsibility.
He also pointed to diversity issues
on campus, and suggested that
the University could do more in
that area by recruiting veterans
through the G.I. Bill.
- Weiser also touched on some of
the negative publicity the Univer-
sity has been receiving recently.
"We have a new president," he
said. "There are some problems.
Give him a chance to fix those
problems."

common occurrence in the play.
"This is a very common reac-
tion in this case where people
are asking, 'Why did she drink
so much? Why did she dress that
way?' Victim-blaming is a secu-
rity operation. It's a way for peo-
ple to feel safer. I'm going to find
something that the victim did
and attribute her victimization to
that then because then if I don't
do that, I'm going to be safe."
Music, Theatre & Dance senior
Jocelyn Weberg, who attended
the performance Thursday, said
the play was successful in explor-

ing themes surrounding sexual
assault.
"The script is new and it's
really relevant," Weberg said. "I
really think it brought up a lot
of issues that people don't really
talk about. A lot of people aren't
really educated in what's right
and what isn't in these kinds of
situations."

characters in the play have a hard

"When you're around your

you have a bunch of girls togeth-

Robert Cantu, clinical pro-
fessor of neurosurgery at
Boston University and senior
adviser to the NFL's Head,
Neck and Spine Committee,
said a proper concussion evalu-
ation - had it been conducted
- would have taken at least 10
to 12 minutes. Certain symp-
toms, such as loss of conscious-
ness, stumbling and impaired
eye movements can lead to a
positive concussion diagno-
sis in fewer than 10 to 12 min-
utes, but a concussion cannot
be confidently ruled out in a
shorter amount of time.
"At the moment of concus-
sion, you don't really know if
it's going to be mild, moderate
or severe, because you don't
know how long the symptoms
are going to last," Cantu said.
Proper neurological exami-
nation following a concussion
includes - but is not limited
to - a 26-symptom checklist,
a neurological assessment of
cognitive aspects and memory,
assessment of eye-tracking and
movement and a range of phys-
ical balance tests.
Each one of these steps is
critical to the overall diagnosis,
especially in potential minor
injury, Cantu said.
"There are certain things
that you really know within
seconds, but for those that have
a lesser degree of concussion
you need to go through a com-
plete neurological exam."
Players who have sustained
concussions face two major
risks if they return to a game
prematurely: second impact

In an interview Wednesday
with The Detroit Free Press,
Brandon placed the fault for
Morris' reinsertion on the
medical staff.
"Our medical staff, which
incorporates all of our trainers,
our physicians - it's a rather
large complement of people
down there - their job is to
notify the coaches ifa situation
occurs where either somebody
needs to come off the field or
somebody cannot go back on
the field." Brandon said.
To improve this communi-
cation, . the Athletic Depart-
ment sent out a statement
Thursday evening outlining its
plans to improve communica-
tion regarding player safety.
The new measures will
include having a certified ath-
letic trainer in the press box to
receive a better perspective on
injuries that may occur on the
field. This improvement will
allow the athletic trainer to
view multiple replays to best
watch for potential injuries.
To increase the effective-
ness of the system, the pro-
gram plans to add a two-way
radio communication process
between the medical staff and
trainers to ensure there are no
further breakdowns in com-
munication.
Another update to the proto-
col includes taking players' hel-
mets away once they are ruled
out of the game with an injury.
The new protocol will be
implemented Saturday night
when Michigan plays at Rut-
gers.

Improved concussion response protocol needed across the NCAA
The recent debacle surrounding the Michigan football
team's handling of sophomore quarterback Shane Morris'
health inevitably turns the discussion toward concussions
and player safety policies. A recently released study found that of
79 deceased NFL players whose brains were examined, 76 had
chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease.
Of a larger pool including 128 former professional,. semi-pro,
college and high school players, 80 percent tested positive for
CTE. Concussions can also have serious consequences in the
short term, as a second hit to the head of a concussed player can
result in serious permanent injury or death. The standard line is
that protecting student-athletes is a priority for the University
and the NCAA, but these institutions must prove this through

it isn't hard to look at all of these

past week have shown a failure to
realize this statement.
But as well-meaning as Schlis-
sel's purposes for his statements are,
it fails to recognize that athletics is
Michigan too. Whether the name of
the school is stitched onto a basket-
ball jersey or printed on adiploma, it
is Michigan, defined not only in the
classroom, but also on the field and
court. Just as I wouldn't claim that
sportswere my only pursuit growing
up, athletics too are not the prima-
ry mission of Michigan. But sports
are and were a key piece to my own:
character and they are an integral
component to what Michigan is.
Last year I would sit outside in

we know that Michigan is better.
I love "Michigan sports," but it's
more because of the former rather
than the latter. Legendary former
football coach Bo Schembechler
once said,"Whenyour teamislosing,

Michigan has lost a lot on the field,
but it has lost more off of it. Yet at
the end of every game without fail,
the band plays "The Victors" and
the last words that echo through
the stadium are "the leaders and the
best," even after a loss. Because that

action rather than words.
The NCAA's official concussion policy con-
tains guidelines thateach of its memberschools
must follow. These policies mandate that insti-
tutions have a yearly concussion education ses-
sion for players, a process for taking players out
of games when they exhibit "signs, symptoms
or behaviors consistent with a concussion," a
policy that prohibits concussed athletes from
returning to athletic activity for the rest of the
day and a policy that requires medical clear-
ance for concussed athletes wishing to return
to athletic activity. These steps are important,
but there remains a lack of oversight and abil-
ity to enforce these guidelines. For an issue as
important as player safety, unenforced guide-
lines that are followed at the schools' discretion
lack the power and enforceability that would
come withclearlydefined rules and subsequent
consequei'es for failure te tomply. Other-'
wise, the policy not only poses a risk to players'
careers, but also to their lives.
The University and NCAA must also be
proactive in addressing the growing problem
of concussions. Recently, the lack of a proper
response to the issue led to a $70-million
settlement by the NCAA in a class action
lawsuit. Pursuing new helmet technology that
aids in concussion detection from helmet-
makers such as Riddelland Xenith should be
enthusiastically backed by the NCAA. With the
potential unreliability of on-field concussion
examinations, the NCAA should also support
new testing protocols such as a proposed
breathalyzer test that can detect concussions..
At his press conference after Saturday's loss
against Minnesota, Michigan football coach
Brady Hoke commented on Morris' injury,
later determined to be aconcussion, sayinghe's
a "tough kid" and "if he didn't want to (play) he
would've come to the sideline or stayed down."
However, athletes are immersed in a culture
of toughness and playing through injury, and
often come off the field only as a last resort.

Hoke's comments reinforce this drive to be
tough at the risk of personal safety. Because of
this mindset, important decisions that impact
player safety cannot be left up to players alone.
These decisions not only fall on the coaching
staff and medical teams on the sideline, but
also on the NCAA and its conferences to
make sure schools follow through on the
commitment to the health and well-being of
its student-athletes.
In order to help remove the human element
from determining whether a potentially con-
cussed player should be removed from a game,
the NCAA should expand the types of situa-
tions in which such a removal must take place.
Currently, a player must leave the field if his
helmet comes off during a play, but this rule
should be expandedto include players involved
in helmet-to-helmet contact penalties and
any other flagged penalties involving a hit to
the helmet, such as roughing the passer. This
would give the medical staff an opportunity for
a quick check for any signs of concussion-like
symptoms, which, if found, would then allow
them to conduct the full concussion assess-
ment. Since the hit on Morris was flagged,
this expansion of the rules would have forced
him to leave the field for a play. Michigan is
also instituting a plan starting with Saturday's
game vs. Rutgers to have a health professional
in the press box to look for potential player
injuries and have two-way radio communica-
tion between the sideline staff and the press
box. This setup, proven necessary by the Mor-
ris incident, should not just be a standard for
Michigan, but across college football.
While the situation with Morris was a huge
mistake, it also serves as a wakeup call for the
University and for other schools around the
country to prevent repeats of the situation and
continue to make player safety a priority. Better
concussion protocol is essential for players'
futures, both on the field and off.

MOZHGAN SAVABIEASFAHANI|
The environmental poisoning of Iraq

When I arrived at Michigan in 2001, I
was interested in researching effects of
environmental pollutants to help protect this
planet from further degradation. By 2004,
wars and invasions had disfigured the face
of my home, the Middle East, so much that it
was no longer recognizable. By that time, the
United States and Israel were both beating
the drum to obliterate my country Iran.
This past summer we all witnessed what
public health looks like after a high-tech mili-
tary outlaw is let loose on a civilian popula-
tion. Israel killed over 2,100 Palestinians and
left more than 10,000 injured, many of whom
will die since the hospitals, clinics and reha-
bilitation centers have been heavily bombed.
Every one of these deaths is due to intense
U.S. military and political support for Israel.
Iraq and Afghanistan were put through the
same nightmare. They will be traumatized for
the next century by the experience.
As global health researchers, it is our
responsibility to think about how we may be
able to prevent such public health catastro-
phes from happening ever again. I have tried
to encourage the University to defend public
health in the Middle East in the past.
Following my interest in public health,
under virtually impossible circumstances, I
developed collaborations with Iraqi doctors
and published our findings with them.
Our Iraq research suggests severe public
contamination by metals heavily used in
weapons manufacturing including lead,
titanium(Savabieasfahani et al. 2014, inpress)
and magnesium. Simultaneously, many Iraqi
children are being born with birth defects

and neurodevelopmental disorders. Some
of these birth defects are so severe that they
have not been reported in any medical books.
Against this backdrop, my colleague, Dr.
Muhsin Al-Sabbak, is coming to the United
States to tour U.S. campuses with me. We will
be discussing our findings on the environmen-
tal poisoning of Iraq and the epidemic of birth
defects in Iraqi cities. He will arrive in Ann
Arbor this Oct. 6. Our tour begins in Michigan.
Our first appearance is at the University of
Michigan School of Natural Resources and
Environment. Those interested can come to
1040 Dana Building on Wednesday Oct. 8 at
5 p.m.. Our talks are entitled "The epidemic
of birth defects in Iraq and the duty of public
health researchers."
We have also been invited to speak at
Princeton, Columbia, Harvard and Boston
University, among others.
Indeed students at the University of
Michigan School of Public Health would
benefit from our presentations. I invite the
UMSPH to seize the opportunity of having an
Iraqi researcher on their campus and to allow
our research in Iraq to become widely known
to their student body. We all know that Iraq is
in shambles because of the outlaw behavior of
the U.S. government.
As public health researchers, we are
responsible to all people of the globe. A one-
hour presentation to UMSPH students would
be of immense value to their global health
mission.

be clear, I am not,
by any stretch of
the imagination,
an expert on the craft of the perfect
cover letter or any of the above-
mentioned pieces of professional
writing. The only thing I really
have over my students is an ability
to string words into semi-coherent
sentences and possibly paragraphs.
Except this use of "only" is a
severe understatement to just how
important language is.
My mother was recently laid off,
and so this job application stuff has
become especially salient in my
family. My mother's grasp of the
English language is limited, which
also limits the kinds of jobs she can
apply for. Based on her work expe-
riences, she qualifies for plenty of
positions that don't require "strong
communication skills," but the bar-
rier is still there. I spent a good deal
of time removing the rookie spelling
mistakes, the grotesque capitaliza-
tion errors, the blatant ignorance of
proper formatting techniques until
all that was left on the page was what
I really believed my mother to be -
dedicated, hard-working, team-ori-
ented, with over a decade of relevant
work experience in a diverse set of
environments. In other words, when
the clunky language no longer drew
attention to itself, the skills that my
mother genuinely could offer to the
position finally came through.
In practicing for an interview:

"No, Mom, it's 'oriented.' Or-EE-en-
ted. Try saying it again."
I'm always anxious when my
mother goes out to her interviews.
Will her voice on the page or in
the e-mail match her speaking
voice? Will the interviewers look
past her accent? Will they even
understand her?
To my student: "You see, in

It's disheartening to hear that

spend the majority of their sum-

English section, only to score sig-

this point, they probably have a bet-

Everything great about the

"Broadchurch," every twist

series seems familiar instead of
surprising. According to former

Kevin Reilly, the ending will be
different, and the show starts
to hint at differences in episode
seven. But that doesn't stop the
first half from feeling like a less-
subtle version of "Broadchurch"
or help the fact that Tennant
is giving a performance that's
nearly identical to his in the
British version. The accent is
different but a lot of the quirks
and characteristics are the same.
It's really unfortunate
that's the case, because on its
own "Gracepoint" is actually
quite good. However, given
"Broadchurch" 's recent run,
which hits a lot of the same
points in a much more subtle
fashion, it's hard to give
a full recommendation to
"Gracepoint." That may change
at the end of the season with the
different ending, but for now,
"Gracepoint" can't be given all
the credit it might otherwise
deserve - and stays firmly in the
shadow of the original.

Striking a balance between
beauty and strength is
difficult, and one that in many
ways defines the feminine
experience. This balancing
act is explored in a unique
way during shows like "Pick a
Card: A Burlesque Exploration
of Tarot," spearheaded by Ann
Arbor native and burlesque
dancer Elizabeth Lottman. A
16-act burlesque variety show
and multimedia experience,
the event brought together
a multitude of national and
international performers in
a one-night exploration of
the mysticism of occult tarot
cards.
Lottman, who performs
under the pseudonym Gala
Delicious, is a student at
Eastern Michigan University
who has been performing
burlesque in Ann Arbor for
about four and a half years.
She previously performed with
Ann Arbor-based burlesque
troupe Tickled Fancy until its
recent disintegration.
Lottman has been a dancer
her whole life, attending
Ann Arbor Community High
School's program Dance Body
Company, where she dedicated
three hours a day, five days a
week to classical dance. It was
during this time that Lottman's
Dance Body teacher urged her
to begin choreographing her
own dances. After graduating
from Community and losing
the opportunity to dance on
such an intensive level, she
felt the need to get back into
dancing as part of her creative
outlet.
A friend and MC at Tickled
Fancy suggested she come to
a show and possibly consider
tryouts later that week. After
sitting thrdugh a performarnce,
Lottman .,said she was
overwhelmed by the need she
felt to try burlesque herself.
"I've always been a little
audacious, and I've always
pushed boundaries, and
I've also been interested in
exploring what it meant to be a
woman and what I was allowed
to do as a woman," Lottman
said. "In high school that's a
really skewed and messed up
perspective that's put on you,
so I saw (burlesque) and ran
with it."
Through Tickled Fancy,
Lottman formed a solid group
of dancer friends and formed
the basis for the performers
appearing in "Pick a Card."
In conceptualizing the show,
Lottman had her heart set
on two things: a burlesque

warm and easy as a standalone,
is chock full of higher-order jokes
for adult viewers. The dramatic
arc feels like a jamboree of crowd

Calvin & Hobbes-ian, and that's
high praise.

I, in my pretentious, twenty-

screenplay occasionally slips in
words like "dichotomy" and the
old-school cartoons are clever
and referentially detailed. For

an allusion to gout, the "rich
man's disease"; in the Victorian

era, people mistakenly thought
that too rich a diet led to tissue
inflammation. And the white
hat? A snarky poke at the idiom
"to don the white hat," a saying
indicating the wearer assumes
the role of Righteousness. In the
case of"The Boxtrolls," the white
hat is a symbol of aristocratic
power, and to the upper crust of
Cheesebridge, "might is right."
The white hat, in Boxtrolls, is
the golden idol serving as a grail
for the antagonists while the
protagonists , pursue greater,
community-oriented dreams.
Why boxes? It's unclear. The
most central symbol of the movie
is the most difficult to unravel.
We imagine it has something to
do with class and Eggs' dubious
self-identification, which makes a
cute subplot, but maybe it's not a
childish question. Maybe we each
need to decide for ourselves what
our "box" is, in our own lives, and
then, after deciding that, decide
whether or not to take it off.
This movie provides us with
sweet, easy answers and endings,
but on the sly, offers some very
complex and difficult questions.
Not an extraordinary movie, but
a curious one. You won't care for
the plot, but you'll remember how
you felt when Eggs licked the fat
lady's wrist.

Building a perfect
playlist for a party

With today's musical
diversity,you can't
please everyone
By KEN SELANDER
DailyArts Writer
The course load at the
University of Michigan is time-
consuming and requires a lot
of hard work. Music definitely
helps me to relax, unwind and
chill out during a stressful day.
It's no secret that students
also like to unwind by partying,
whether you're in Greek Life or
throwing a rager at your house
or apartment every so often.
I recently found myself at a
party where the music selection
on a friend's playlist was simply
not cutting it. I stepped in
and DJ-ed for an hour (read:
plugged an aux cable into my
iPhone and pressed play on a
bunch of songs). By the endI felt
as if I had compromised my own
musical integrity for the sake of
entertaining people. Everyone
responded well to Katy Perry,
Gnarls Barkley and Eminem,
but the second I turned on some
personalfavoriteslike ZZ Topor
Lil Boosie I could immediately
see the dissatisfaction brewing
in the crowd.
What exactly makes a
good party song? How did I
intuitively know which songs
people would make people stay
and which would be a stretch,
and how do others know the
same?
Obviously this article will
be biased toward my own
experiences, but I'll proceed
anyway.
To loosely define a "party,"
as I'm trying to explain it,
whoever is running the musical
selection cannot personally
know the music preferences of

the majority of people attending
and there can't be a theme
dictating the tunes.
There always seems.to be a
basic formula applied to concoct
a playlist to appease the general
audience. Typical playlists at
parties consist of the following:
EDM/Dubstep, throwbacks,
pop music and novelty songs.
All of these selections have
either lots of bass or are simply
well known.
Electronic music is
commonplace at parties
because it'supbeat, excitingand
often has aggressive, repetitive
bass that's easy to dance to. I've
heard "Clarity" by Zedd way
too many times. Throwbacks
are tracks known by most
everyone because of their
convenient placement in our
childhoods, so they resonate
with everyone's younger self
and are fun to sing along to. In
my mind, pop music consists
of rap (whether for comical or
hype affect) and anything on
the Top 40 - "Anaconda" by
Nikki Minaj, "Wrecking Ball"
by Miley Cyrus or anything by
Juicy J.
The novelty category applies
to songs that a lot of people
know because they are bizarre
or wild. The couple tracks that
immediately come to mind are
"Gangnam Style" and "Hot.
N*gga," both of which have
accompanying dances, too.
And yes, that's a lot of songs
covered in the four categories,
but there are still a number of
genres left out.
As a music snob of sorts, I
find myself exclaiming "this
song sucks" a handful of times
at parties, but is there crossover
between good party music and
good music in general?
Yes.
Looking at my own track
record of musical interests, I'm

all over the board -rock, rap,
hell, even heavy metal. I qualify
mostofwhatI listento as "good"
music because it requires skill
in my mind. Accordingly, I often
ponder the difference between
what is more thoughtful rap and
extreme gangsta rap - Gucci
Mane, Migos, Lil' Boosie and
Chief Keef - and why a very
white kid from the suburbs
listens to some Boosie Bad Azz
on the way to class in between
Led Zeppelin and Elvis records.
Why do I like it? Analyzing
gangsta music in the context of
party playlists, it's essentially a
grey area between party music
and good or personal music.
It's just fun to listen to - I don't
think it has any particular
musical value to speak of, and I
sure as hell can'trelate to selling
crack out of a trap house. I'm
not saying Oj Da Juiceman is the
greatest rapper ever, but "Make
the Trap Say Aye" is too funny
not to blare on some speakers.
How do I relate this tangent
to party music? The ever-
constant song requester.
When you think- about it,
that requester bothering a
DJ despite your carefully
selected playlist is actually a.
good sign. The requester is just
attempting to make a party
more personal. While requests
in my experience are highly
obnoxious and frequent, the
basic concept behind such
requests shows exactly how
party playlists are supposed
to work - the requesters are
satisfied enough to stay at the
party even though a particular
song they want hasn't been
played, but nonetheless they
want to hear their own song so
they can feel special.
So in the end, party music
keeps everyone content and in
attendance - until the booze
runs out, that is.

I'm not sure if there is a
defined genre of food movies,
but if there isn't, there should
be. However, that doesn't
mean that there aren't mov-
ies, or at least scenes in them,
invested in
food and
cooking,
in chefs
and restau-
rants. Yes,
these mov- ,
ies can ulti- GIANCARLO
mately be
about life BUONOMO
or love, but
the food
still matters. As Jim Harri-
son once said to a New York
Times reporter, "Food is a
great literary theme. Food in
eternity, food and sex, food
and lust. Food is a part of
the whole of life. Food is not
separate." With that in mind,
I would like to share with you
a few scenes that celebrate
food, scenes that have ment-
and always will mean a great
deal to me.
10) The cooking scene
from "The Godfather."
Peter Clemenza shows
Michael Corleone the secret
to making great spaghetti and
meatballs: a dash of sugar.
It's a sweet moment between
two guys who end up killing
about a dozen people each.
9) The roast chicken
scene from "Amlie." .
Our titular heroine finds a
box hidden in her bathroom
wall, placed there by a boy
named Dominique Breto-
deau years ago. She wants
to return the box to the now
adult Dominique, and season
his life with sone happiness.
However, we learn what real-
ly makes him happy: carving
up a roasted bird and then
sinking his hands into the
steaming carcass to pick out
every last scrap of meat.
8) The sandwich scene
from "Spanglish."
I've always found it, well,
funny, that Adam Sandler
excels in dramatic roles.
This is one of his best, in his
portrayal of LA chef John
Clasky. In one scene, John
improvises a glorious sand-
wich that looks like a combo
of a ham and cheese and
BLT, complete with a runny
egg. My favorite part of this
scene is that world-renowned
chef Thomas Keller actually
designed the sandwich for
the movie and taught Sandler
how to make it.
7) The eggplant scene
from "The Lunchbox."

I saw this film over the
summer, and when I left the
theater, I didn't talk for a
solid 20 minutes. Of all the
"food" movies I've seen, I ..
think "The Lunchbox" is
the best exploration of what
food can mean both by itself
and as a source of connec-
tion between people. A young
housewife sends a lunch-
box into Mumbai everyday,
except instead of going to
her husband it gets delivered
to a widowed accountant.
Food and memory constantly
intertwine - she sends him
a special eggplant dish, the
comforting flavor of which
reminds him of a dish his
wife used to make.
6) The spaghetti and
risotto scene from "Big
Night."
As an admittedly snobbish
Italian, I've always gotten a
kick out of the saga of two
old-world brothers and theirw
struggle to serve authentic
food to Americans. Thafun-
niest part is when a customer
tells Secondo, the general
manager, that she wants a
side of spaghetti with her
risotto - a starchy taboo.
When Secondo brings this
request to Primo, his brother
and the chef, he exclaims
"That bitch!" Secondo pleads
with him to just indulge her,
but Primo replies, "She's a
criminal. I need to talk with
her!"
5) The Big Kahuna Burger
scene from "Pulp Fiction."
After a vigorous exposi-
tion of what McDonalds in
France calls their burgers,
Vincent and Jules barge in on
Brett and his buddies, who
have Marcellus Wallace's
briefcase. As a gesture of his
power over Brett - or maybe
just because he's hungry -
Jules takes a nice bite out
of Brett's Hawaiian burger.
I've always wondered how
a burger becomes "Hawai-
ian"; is the bun a Hawaiian
roll? Does it have pineapple?
Either way, that look on
Jules' face when he washes
the burger down with Brett's
Sprite is priceless - it can
only be described as an extra-
terrestrial smirk.
4) The soup scene from
"Ratatouille."
Anyone can cook, accord-
ing to this Pixar tour-de-
force. How they came up
with the plot - a French
rat who wants to become a
gourmet chef - is beyond me,
but that's why I don't make
movies. The best scene by
far is when Retmy covertly

3) Anything from "Chef."
So that I don't turn out
like Jonah Lehrer, I won't
just quote the review of it I
wrote this summer, where I
couldn't contain my excite-
ment for this magical movie.
It's as if Jon Favreau was
smoking joints rolled out
of back issues of Gourmet
Magazine.
2) The shrimp-vibrator
scene from "Tampopo."
This Japanese flick, Tffec-
tionately labeled a "Ramen
Western," is one of the fun
niest films ever made. The
main story arc is the plight of
a young widow to make the
best ramen possible, aided
by a truck driver and her
young son. However, there
are numerous other vignettes
that all deal with food and
sex and folly. My favorite is
one about a mobster whose
appetite for food overlap
with his appetite for his girl-
friends' body. One of his pre-
ferred games is placing live
shrimp in a bowl with some
soy sauce, and then over-
turning it onto his ladies lady
parts. The crustaceans thrash
and swim, giving her a literal
food orgasm.

fixes Linguini's soup. With
that great big-band music
in the background, Remy
pours in broth and cream,
salt and seasoning, herbs
and whatever else he can get
his paws on. Apparently the
animators researched how
leeks fall off the stalk when
sliced. Whatever they did
worked, because the ones
Remy throws in the pot are
tres bons.

1) The dinner scene from
"Tom Jones."
Based on Henry Field-
ing's novel, this quirky com-
edy chronicles a hedonistic
yet kindhearted foundling,
raised as a country gentle-
man, and his quest to learn
his origins and win the love
of his life. In the dinner
scene, Tom and a woman he
met on the road share supper

Wolverines open at Ferris

Waldeck trifecta
leads to easy win

By ZACH SHAW

Despite NCAA rules
limiting the coaching staff's
participation in practice and
a young group still getting

No. 8 Michigan
hockey team

time on any
one phase
of the game
for me to tell you we're game-
ready," said Michigan coach
Red Berenson. "But I think the
players are anxious to play, and
the enthusiasm will be there.
We just need to capitalize on
our breaks and minimize their
breaks."
The opening game kicks
off yet another season of high
expectationsfortheWolverines.
Followingadisappointing18-13-
4 campaign last year, Michigan
still showcases enough talent
to garner a top-10 ranking and
be picked by coaches to finish
second in the Big Ten.
Junior forward and
returning captain Andrew
Copp and sophomore forward
JT Compher look to bring
back their top-scoring tandem
from last season. In total, the
Wolverines bring back five
of their top-10 scorers from
last season, and the addition
of highly touted recruit and
freshman forward Dylan Larkin
will give Michigan plenty of
scoring threats on its top three
lines.

For the Daily
Despite conceding early,
the Michigan women's soccer
team left no doubt on the field
Thursday against Nebraska. .
Nicky Waldeck's hat trick led
the Wolverines to a 3-i comeback
victory.
From NEBRASKA 1
the first MICHIGAN 3
whistle,
the Wolverines exhibited a
comfort in possessing the ball
out of their own defensive third.
Michigan's back line patiently
circulated the ball until
opportunities to play it over
the top to a target striker were
available. Nebraska prepared
with a counter-attacking
defensive shape, employing all
10 field players to sit behind the
ball untiltheygainedpossession.
Although Michigan displayed
dominance in the air and an
acute level of defensive discipline
for the majority of the game, it
found itself down early due to a
poor defensive clearance.
In the eighth minute, after
the Wolverines failed to clear
a blocked shot, Nebraska
forward Mayme Conroy gained
possession inside the 18-yard box
and buried a shot firmly in the
bottom right corner of the goal.
However, Michigan continued
to dominate possession and
apply intense pressure until its
scoringbreakthrough. In the 31st
minute of the first half, redshirt
freshman forward Ani Sarkisian
won possession in the midfield
and played a ball over the top
of the defense to sophomore
forward Waldeck. After beating
a defender in a one-on-one
situation, Waldeck dribbled past
the goalkeeper and tapped the

ball in from three yards away.
After putting one on the board,
the Wolverines played with an
air of confidence, when they
scored for the second time in the
first half. In the 42nd minute,
after an interception, freshman
midfielder Niki Wilkinsonplayed
Waldeck in on a breakaway with
the Cornhuskers' keeper. In a
similar fashion, Waldeck drew
the keeper off her goal line and
slotted the ball in.
In the second half, Nebraska
began with intense pressure
and escalated the speed of play.
It appeared that the Wolverines
would concede a second goal
for the first 20 minutes of the
second half, as the Cornhuskers
maintained the majority of
possession and had two shots
on goal.
However, in the 65th minute,
Waldeck relieved the pressure
by completing her hat trick.
Junior midfielder Corinne
Harris sent a through ball to
Waldeck, who hit it across her
body and placed it brilliantly in
the bottom left corner.
Waldeck's hat trick makes
her the Wolverines' highest
scorer, with eight goals.
Waldeck though, was quick to
deflect credit for the feat to her
teammates.
"The last person to do it was
Nkem (Ezurike) in 2011.... So the
fact that I'm being associated
with that is humbling and
incredible," Waldeck said. "They
were all pretty similar goals....
They were just great passes, the
balls through were perfectly
timed and weighted."
The Wolverines remain
undefeated at home this season,
and Michigan coach Greg
Ryan won't understate the
unblemished home slate.

JAMESCOLLtR/Daily
The Michigan hockey team's rood bock to the NCAA Tournament begins Saturday with a touth lest away from Yost.

But questions remain on
defense - a weak point in each
of the past two seasons. This
year's team features just two
upperclassmen on the blue line.
Berenson is counting on the
talented and energetic crop of
freshmen and sophomores to
mesh with the experience of
returning goalies junior Steve
Racine and sophomore Zach
Nagelvoort.
"I think we've got two goalies
we can play, whereas last year
I wasn't sure," Berenson said.
"On defense we don't have the
seniors we had last year, so
we're going to be relying on
some of our younger guys to
step up. So far I've liked the
energy from the younger guys.
"We might not be as deep
on defense as last year, but we

might be better on defense."
on the other side of the
ice, the Bulldogs are quite the
opposite. After falling just one
double-overtime loss shy of the
Frozen Four last March, Ferris
State graduated a number of key
offensive weapons, but returns
an experienced and hungry
lineup led by senior goaltender
and captain CJ Motte.
"Their strength starts in goal,
where CJ Motte is as good as
it gets and is a real top college
goalie, and their defense is
good around him," Berenson
said. "They've got all their
defensemen back but one, so I
think it'll be a tough challenge
for us."
The matchup also presents a
unique challenge for Michigan
sophomore forward Tyler

Motte, CJ's brother. The two
faced off last year in Ann Arbor,
the Wolverines winning in a
shootout.
"Last year (against Ferris
State,) my mom had the split
sweater going with half-
Michigan, half-Ferris, and
my dad went with the neutral
gray," Tyler said. "Our friends
and family get into it, probably
more than we do, but it can be
a lot of fun. We're both playing
on competitive programs and
trying to get a victory, so we
really look at it as just another
game."
It's early in the year, it's 'a
non-conference game and the
Wolverines may not feel ready,
but ultimately come Saturday
night, Michigan hockey will be
back.


. LeVert, Albrecht take veteran roles

By LEV FACHER
Daily Sports Editor
The Michigan men's
basketball team's leadership
duties for the 2014-15 season will
fall to a pair with a reputation for
being soft-spoken: junior guards
Spike Albrecht and Caris LeVert.
Albrecht, LeVert and senior
forward Max Bielfeldt are the
only upperclassmen among the
15 players the Wolverines list
on their roster. And it seems
that from the get-go, beginning
with Michigan's summer trip
to Italy, the duo of juniors has
been taking its role-model
responsibility seriously.
"It could be something as
simple as making sure you're
showing up to practice 10 or 15
minutes early and not in there
looking sleepy-eyed," Albrecht
said. "That type of stuff will
drive the coaches nuts."
Albrechtadmittedthatneither
he nor LeVert is outspoken in
the first place, making their
emergence as leaders more of an
intentional transition than an
organic one.
"It's interesting, because both
Carla and myself are a little
bit more mellow, kind of shy,"
Albrecht said. "But when we
talk, people listen. Like I said
earlier, we've kind of earned our
stripes here. We're juniors now.
We have respect among some
of the other guys in the locker
room."
The team's early cohesion has
impressed Michigan coach John
Beilein, who said this squad has
gelled in the early going as well
as any other in his eight years at
the helm.
The Wolverines had the
advantage of spending 10 days in
Italy over the summer, playing
four games against competition
that generally wasn't ready for
them. And with six incoming
freshmen, Michigan was happy
__to take advantage of a ready-
made opportunity for bonding
and growth while overseas.
"This group right now is very
connected for this age," Beilein
said. "That has a lot to do with
the personality of Spike and

Caris and (sophomore forward
Zak Irvin and sophomore
guard Derek Walton), who are
extremely otgoing."
It's clear that Albrecht and
LeVertwill lead moreby example

FOOTBALL
Q&A withDaily
Targum reporter

Conference moves
create matchup
between oldest
teams in FBS
By MAX COHEN
Daily Sports Editor
When Rutgers joined the
Big Ten, there were numerous
questions about how its
football team would fit into
the conference. The -Scarlet
Knights were viewed as an
underwhelming program, one
incapable of competing for Big
Ten titles.
But it's Michigan (0-1 Big Ten,
2-3 overall) that desperately
needs a win entering the first-
ever meeting between the
historic programs. Rutgers (0-1,
4-1) put ascare into Penn State in
its first Big Ten game, ultimately
falling short in a 13-10 loss in
Piscataway, but the Wolverines
fell to Minnesota in their opener,
30-14.
Though the Scarlet Knights
are new to the Big Ten, the
program's history is lengthy.
Rutgers participated in the
first-ever college football game,
defeating Princeton, 6-4,on Nov.
6,1869.
Michigan played its first game
10 years later, defeating Racine,
1-0,onMay 30,1879. Rutgers and
Michigan are the two oldest FBS
football programs.
The Scarlet Knights
historically haven't experienced
the success the Wolverines have.
Rutgers is 464-437-22 all-time,
and didn't have a single winning
season between 1992 and 2005.
But the Scarlet Knights have had
just two losing seasons since.
Former head coach Greg
Schiano helped put the program
in position to win consistently
during his 11-season tenure from
2001 to 2011. The highlight of
Rutgers' recent success came
during the 2006 season, in which

By ALEJANDRO ZONIGA
ManagingSports Editor
The Daily Targum writer Greg
Johnson discusses the upcoming
Michigan-Rutgers game.
The Michigan Daily:
Quarterback Gary Nova has
really struggled at times this
year, including that ugly five-
interception game against Penn
State. How much of the blame
lies with him?
Greg Johnson: Nova's
inconsistencies over the years
have been his own sporadic
decision-making, but he tends to
run into trouble when he's asked
to do too much. Nova has talent
and can make plays when the
offense is in rhythm, but he's best
suited as a game manager. He's
excelled in that role the last two
weeks, so granted Rutgers runs
the ball effectively early, we'll
see if he can deliver in a big game
against the Michigan defense.
TMD: Saturday's meeting will
be the first between these two
storied programs, but Michigan
is far from the level most
people expect of it. What's the
excitement level like given the
Wolverines' poor starts
GJi Despite the 2-3 record,
Michigan is still Michigan to
Rutgers and its fans, and a win
would be huge this weekend.
Given the crushing loss to Penn
State and the factthatthis athletic
department has had its own
share of PR nightmares the last
couple years, fans are desperate
to see this program make noise in
the Big Ten and keep moving in
the right direction.
TMD: Rutgers is a big first-
half team; Michigan can't seem
to score in any way. The Scarlet
Knights capitalize on turnovers;
the Wolverines' offense can't
stop committing them. Does it

feel like Michigan iswalking into
abuzz saw in Piscataway?
GJ: It's funny how the
narrative has gone from"Rutgers
might have a chance" in the
preseason to now . essentially
"Rutgers better not lose." I
wouldn't be shocked if the
Knights pull away handily in
this one, but I also wouldn't be
surprised if Rutgers lays a goose
egg.Therealotofreasonstothink
Rutgers is getting Michigan at a
perfect time, but there's still alot
of talent on that roster. On paper
this is certainly a game Rutgers
should win.
TMD: What has the move to
the Big Ten been like?
GJ: It's exciting. It's bringing
in tons of notoriety and definitely
helpingrecruitinginalotofways.
Having The Big Ten Network set
on campus for the first time a
few weeks ago was great for the
fans. Granted, the conference's
football product hasn't been
great so far this year, but there's
a tremendous buzz when people
think of the history and prestige-
of the Big Ten.
TMD: Finally, we'd be
remiss not to talk about Andre
Hunt, the freshman walk-on
who is listed as a co-starter for
Saturday's. meeting. And in the
bigger picture, how will Rutgers
be affected most by the 19-man
injury list?
GJ: Hunt is a great guy with
an even better backstory. Almost
quit football after blowing out
both of his knees in high school
back in Minnesota.
As far as the lengthy injury
list, most of the guys on there are
just for precautionary measures.
Only star running back Paul
James' torn ACL really matters
long-term. Kyle Flood is also less
cryptic with injuries than alot of
college head coaches, including
Brady Hoke, it seems like.

The Michigan football team has struggled to manage much offensively, and It will be tested by a ferocious Rutgers 'D.'

the Scarlet Knights went 11-2.
Runningback Ray Rice became a
national star, leadingthe offense
and rushing for 1,794 yards and
20 touchdowns.
On Nov. 29 of that year, the
undefeated, 15th-ranked Scarlet
Knights upset No. 3 Louisville,
28-25, in a game many
remember as "Pandemonium
in Piscataway." Because of the
program's previous lack of
success, the fans were raucous
when presented with the
opportunity to see their team
play in a big game. When the
upset concluded, the fans rushed
the field.
Though the team eventually
lost two games, the contest
set the precedent for added
excitement about the Rutgers

program. Many compared the
environment at the Scarlet
Knights' first Big Ten home
game against the Nittany Lions
to the atmosphere at the 2006
Louisville game. Saturday's
game against the Wolverines is
sold out, and the atmosphere is
expected to be rowdy.
Fifth-year senior .Devin
Gardner will be Michigan's
starting quarterback once again
after he was benched in favor
of sophomore Shane Morris
before the Wolverines' loss to
Minnesota.
Gardner won't have much
time to get comfortable now that
he has regained his position.
Rutgers currently leads the
Big Ten with 21 sacks, posing
a challenge to Michigan's

relatively inexperienced
offensive line. Michigan coach
Brady Hoke said a variety of
issues have plagued his team in
pass protection.
"We cut some guy loose
because we were a little over-
aggressive, and we cut some guys
loose because we hadn't picked it
up the right way from a backfield
standpoint, and we cut some guys
loose because our quarterback
hasn't stepped up in the pocket,"
Hoke said Wednesday.
In most weeks, off-field
issues serve as an interruption
from football talk. But with.
controversy swirling around
the handling of Morris' injury,
football will give Michigan
a much-needed break from
everything else.


Q&A: Kyle Flood

Breakdown: Distractions loom

By ALEXA DETTELBACH
Daily SportsEditor
Michigan coach Brady Hoke
said Wednesday that Rutgers is
a "well-coached football team"
whose success begins with
coach Kyle Flood.
Flood has led the Scarlet
Knights for three years after
replacing coach Greg Schiano,
who left for the NFL in 2011.
He's gone 16-10 with Rutgers.
The Daily sat down with
Flood at Big Ten Media Day in
August.
The Michigan Daily: What
are you most excited about with
Rutgers joining the Big Ten?
Kyle Flood: I think there's a
couple things that come up right
away. It's one of the power five
conferences; we're in the elite
academic athletic conference in
the country. So to me, you have
a destination location, which in
college football the landscape a
couple years ago, not everybody
has that now. We feel like we
belong here. This is a very
good marriage for Rutgers and
the Big Ten. So to me that part
of it now we can move past it,
and now we're trying to win
championships.
TMD: What have you found
as the biggest challenge with
the transition?
KF: For us as coaches, we
have a yearly routine of how
you go about things, so now
this year because it's a new
conference, 12 new opponents
on our schedule, not just the
conference schedule. That's
been the most taxing thing on
our staff. But really in terms of
how we got about things and
how we train, we've been doing
it at Rutgers a long time so that
doesn't change for us.
TMD: You've been coaching
for over 20 years, how do you
still find it exciting everyday?
KF: There's no better way to
spend your waking hours than
to work with young people and
to me, I started as a high school
math teacher, then I moved to

the coaching profession. When
you have the opportunity to
work with young people that
energizes you a lot I think.
TMD: You guys were in the
Jabrill Peppers conversation for
a while, what kind of player do
you think he is?
KF: I think Jabrill is quite
a good football player. He was
certainly a good football player
in high school, but now he's
going to have to transition into
college. There's no question he
has a high ceiling.
TMD: Now that Rutgers has
a Midwest connection how can
that help with recruiting and
the direction of the program?
KF: I think what it does
it really opens up some not
traditional areas. We have a
quarterback and a receiver that
we got from Michigan, a tight
end from Minnesota, a tight end
from Texas. The access to those
players, although we're not
going to be full time recruiting
in the Midwest, because there's
not really a huge population
of players close to home, but if
there's a position we need we
can go out there and get it and
that'll be good. Plus, they'll be
interested in coming to the Big
Ten.
TMD: Did you notice a big
bump in recruiting over the
year once it was decided you
were moving to the Big Ten?
KF: Absolutely, there's no
doubt. The best players in high
school want to play against the
best. You're playing against
some of the most historic
programs in the history of
college football. There's no
doubt that's what they want.
TMD: What can you say
about the Michigan-Rutgers
matchup that's going to be at
night in High Point Solutions
Stadium stadium?
KF: It's a very big game and
will be great for our program.
As for the event side, like I said
I don't know much about it, but
I'm sure it will be great.

The Daily breaks down this
week's matchup.
Michigan pass offense vs.
Rutgers pass defense
Michigan's passing lives and
dies with junior wide receiver
Devin Funchess, which should
make for easy game planning
for the Rutgers defense. Fifth-
year senior quarterback Devin
Gardner's rapport with wide
receivers against Minnesota
didn't look better than it did two
weeks before against Utah.
But the Rutgers passing
defense ranks 13th in the Big
Ten, and has allowed nearly
1,400 total yards having played
the likes of Tulane and Howard.
The Scarlet Knights have just
three interceptions this season,
but they could feast on Gardner's
inaccuracy.
In this case, it's a matter of
which one makes the fewest
mistakes.
Edge: Rutgers
Michigan rush offense vs.
Rutgers rush defense
The Michigan rushing game,
once led by sophomore Derrick
Green, is now up in the air after
he struggled against the Golden
Gophers. Sophomore De'Veon
Smith hasn't proved to be much
of a better back, but did find some
room last Saturday.
The Wolverines' line hasn't
been able to open up enough
holes betweenthe tackles.
Combined with Rutgers
defensive end Darius Hamilton,
who has six tackles for loss this
season, and a 49th-ranked Scarlet
Knights rush defense, this doesn't
bode well for Michigan.
Edge: Rutgers

Rutgers quarterback Gary Nova threw five picks against Penn State, but he can be an efficient game manager.

running game's success to take
the pressure off him. When's
he forced to drop back to pass,
as opposed to using play action,
Nova's arm is exposed. Against
Penn State three weeks ago, he
threw five interceptions.
Michigan's secondary,
meanwhile, returns junior safety
Jarrod Wilson and senior corner
back Raymon Taylor to bring
back some experience and depth
at the positions.
Edge: Michigan
Rutgers rush offense vs.
Michigan rush defense
One team's strength against
another team's strength means
something has to budge. And the
way Michigan has played against
the rush, it should find the upper
hand.
It's led by a line that doesn't
miss a beat often, regardless of
who steps in. Redshirt sophomore
defensive tackles Willie Henry
and Ryan Glasgow held their own
this year. But against Minnesota,

they were gashed for 167yards.
The Wolverines have allowed
more than 100 yards in just two
games this season, and have
otherwise allowed exactly three
yards per carry. Rutgers, led by
Paul James' five touchdowns and
5.7 yards per carry, hasn't been
tested at the line.
Edge: Michigan
Specialteams
This could very well determine
a game in which both sides
appear even with each other.And
if that's the case, it doesn't bode
well for the Wolverines.
Its punting blunder against
Utah aside, Michigan hasn't given
reason to be optimistic that it can
make a big play. The Wolverines
are 11th in the Big Ten in punt-
return average and 12th in kick
returns.
Junior Dennis Norfleet hasn't
had a chance to run with the ball
when punt coverage doesn't give
him enough time to catch the ball
and break free.

Redshirt sophomore Amarah
Darboh and Peppers haven't
made much of an impact
themselves as returners.
While Rutgers hasn't played
much better on return coverage,
it does have four blocked kicks
that could be pivotal to swinging
momentum.
Edge: Rutgers
Intangibles
In theory, Michigan should be
motivated to silence critics who
have grown louder each week.
But with all the distraction
surrounding Michigan coach
Brady Hoke and Athletic
Director Dave Brandon, it's going
to be tough to keep focused on
this game. It's an opponent the
Wolverines haven't faced, and
things could come crashing down
quickly on the road.
With Michigan earning all
of the attention, the Scarlet
Knights should be more focused.
FINAL: Rutgers 24,
Michigan 21
