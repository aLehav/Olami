ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

It was a tense night in the 

Central 
Student 
Government 

chambers as attendees discussed 
the question of divestment and 
Students Allied for Freedom 
and Equality petitioned CSG 
to pass a resolution supporting 
the divestment from companies 
operating in Israel on the behalf 
of Israel.

Last year, during the David 

Schafer administration — the 
previous CSG president — the 
resolution failed to pass — 
however, with its closest margin 
ever, at 34 to 13.

A group of about 50 students 

from the Latinx Alliance for 
Community Action, Support and 
Advocacy arrived at the chambers 
during community concerns to 
present their case in support of the 
Palestinian students on campus 
— which is not yet a resolution. 
The group petitioned and spoke 
about how they believed in and 
supported divestment.

“It is my moral obligation to 

stand here in solidarity with my 
Palestinian brothers and sisters,” 
Public Policy senior Gloriela 
Iguina-Colon said. “As Latinx 
people we know what it feels 
like to be run out of our homes, 
to know that there are legacies 
of colonialism persisting today, 
to feel in our souls the pain of 
ours and others’ oppression, to 
know that our liberation is bound 
together.”

Representatives from LACASA 

related 
to 
the 
struggles 
of 

Palestinian students and spoke 
about how they believed these 
companies 
were 
committing 

human rights violations. Heated 
arguments formed as the group 
expressed 
their 
sentiments 

and were quickly silenced by 
CSG’s uniform processes and 
regulations.

Some CSG members fired 

back and asked the community 
members to stop disrespecting 
them, 
to 
which 
the 
group 

responded by saying they were 
trying to make their voices 
heard to the people they elected 
as representatives.

This 
later 
sparked 
a 

conversation 
among 
CSG 

members to pause rules and 
open caucus during agenda 
topics like community concerns 
in order to make CSG more 

accessible to the general student 
body. 

Another group, who said 

they were Palestinian students 
speaking on behalf of other 
Palestinians, called on CSG to 
support them in having their 
concerns acknowledged by the 
University of Michigan. They 
called for CSG’s assistance in 
creating an ad hoc, unbiased 
committee of professionals to 
look further into the issue and 
hear concerns on both sides.

“What 
we’re 
proposing 

with this resolution is for the 
University to create a board 
to make these decisions about 
divestment,” LSA senior Reema 
Kaakarli said. “What we’re 
asking for, because we know 
this is such a controversial 
and difficult topic, is for the 
University to create an ad hoc 

committee to work directly 
with the divestment office, and 
put together a group of people 
who have a lot of knowledge 
about the University and how 
divesting would work.”

The group called for CSG to 

acknowledge their voices and 
the needs of the students at the 
University, and asked for help 
in getting administration to do 
the same. They want a group 
of 
impartial 
individuals 
to 

research into the situation and 
student reactions and propose 
alternate companies to divest 
in.

CSG also passed resolutions 

in 
support 
of 
funding 
a 

SAPAC conference, protecting 
resources 
that 
support 

survivors of sexual assault and 
a calculator loan program, both 
unanimously.

Black 
holes, 
new 
planet 

discoveries and now, breaking 
records. 
For 
University 

researchers, the sky isn’t the 
limit — and neither is space. 

A 
Hall 
thruster 
engine 

designed by a University of 
Michigan team has broken 
records 
in 
its 
speed 
and 

efficiency, 
compared 
to 

similar devices used in space 
technology today.

The project research and 

development was headed by 
Alec 
Gallimore, 
University 

of 
Michigan 
professor 
of 

aerospace 
engineering 
and 

Robert 
J. 
Vlasic 
dean 
of

The development of a Hall 

thruster relies on technology 
which 
utilizes 
the 
power 

generation 
capability 
of 
a 

spacecraft 
through

rays, putting power in a small 
amount of propellants, more 
than

The Meijer grocery shuttle, 

a Central Student Government 
initiative 
that 
last 
year 

provided 
students 
with 
a 

weekly bus shuttle to Meijer, 
has 
been 
discontinued 
for 

future use. The service was 
launched in fall 2016 under 
former CSG President David 
Schafer’s 
administration, 

which worked closely on the 
issue of food insecurity on 
campus.

According to Engineering 

junior AJ Ashman, CSG chief 
of staff to the vice president, 
the program began with a 
commission within Shafer’s 
administration in order to 
assist freshmen who live off 
campus or who might not be 
aware of the food options 
available to them outside of 
the dining halls. Specifically, a 
goal of the administration was 
to help those students of low 
socioeconomic 
backgrounds 

find 
less 
expensive 
food 

options, 
as 
many 
grocery 

stores in the heart of campus 
are more expensive are than

Considering 
the 
protests 

on campus that followed the 
speech from Charles Murray 
last month and student concerns 
over a possible visit from 
Richard Spencer, The Daily sat 
down with University President 
Mark 
Schlissel 
to 
address 

these issues, the progress the 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
plan has made over the past 
year and the renaming of the 
C.C. Little building.

The Michigan Daily: Since 

our last meeting with you, the 
one-year anniversary for the 
DEI plan has passed. How do 
you think the progress has been 

going and how has its execution 
really been performed over the 
past year?

President Mark Schlissel: I 

think the best way of answering 
that is to highlight next week’s 
summit. So we have a Diversity, 
Equity and Inclusion summit 
with multiple events through 
the week, which will include 
Rob Sellers and myself releasing 
our report on the first year, 
which has both a summary and 
then a whole bunch of individual 
reports from all the schools and 
colleges that lays out each of 
their objectives and reports on 
progress over the first year. If I 
had to say in general, I think the 
initiative is off to a good start, 
but there’s a huge amount of 
work to be done and there are 
some things that are immediate 
and short term, and there are

Students think there’s more to 
housing than SES, survey finds

Results indicate students wary of expense, relationship between SES and location

The Michigan Daily administered 

a survey to 1,000 randomly selected 
respondents at the University of 
Michigan campus. There were 100 
respondents, representative of all off-
campus neighborhoods as delineated 
by Beyond the Diag. The following 

article includes data collected in this 
survey, particularly regarding the 
relationship between socioeconomic 
status and housing location.

For Kinesiology sophomore Paige 

Willian, the matter of procuring 
off-campus housing was a decision 
shaped by recommendations from 
her peers rather than monthly 
rent — yet, after having lived in her 

apartment for a couple of months, 
she said she now strongly believes 
housing is segregated by students’ 
financial situations.

“Looking for housing last year, 

I was fortunate enough to not 
worry too much about the price 
of my living situation,” she said. 
“I chose my apartment building 
through recommendations from 

older students I knew that were 
older than me who do happen to 
be of similar socioeconomic status 
to myself. This year I definitely see 
that this results in segregation of 
housing by how much students can 
afford.”

other things that we start now 
and we are going to have to be 
continued for a long time and 
there’s still other things that 
we learn about and decide there 
are better ways to do the things 
that we already started doing. 
So it’s very much a living and 
continuously renewing plan.

Some of the things I’m most 

excited about is we’ve got a 
number of pipeline programs 
up 
and 
running, 
including 

Wolverine 
Pathways 
that 

works with students in seventh 
through 12th grade and it’s after 
school, on the weekend and (in) 
summertime and, at the end, if 
they do well, and they get into 
the University, we promise them 
a generous scholarship at the 
end. And we’ve launched the 
Go Blue Guarantee in January, 
which is designed to promise 
socioeconomic 
diversity 
on 

campus, and when you get 
socioeconomic diversity you also 
get geographic diversity and all 
different kinds of diversity come 
along with that, so those things 

are going well. The schools and 
colleges are working on their 
local plans to work on the climate 
locally and in each of our schools 
to gauge how well we appreciate 
and address issues of difference 
between humans. There’s an 
inventory work that has been 
done — diversity inventory work 
has been done in the dorms, so 
there’s a lot of activity. Another 
big thing that we’ll talk about at 
the summit was one of our major 
goals of the first year, which 
was a campus climate survey. 
We’ll be releasing the results in 
the coming days. … It asks the 
question: How are we doing? 
What is it like to be a student, 
or a faculty or a staff member 
here at the University and it’s 
disappointing but not surprising 
I guess is that different people 
experience this campus very 
differently 
based 
on 
where 

they’re coming from. So I think 
those results are very important 
to show us where to focus our 
efforts, to establish a baseline we 
can use to track whether we are 
improving the campus climate. 
The end goal is to have each 
individual here — no matter 

where they come from — have 
equal opportunity and a similar 
quality of experience, feel like 
they’re being equitably treated 
and being a full member of this 
large and diverse community. 
So we’re going to roll out that 
and speak during the diversity 
summit on what we’re learning 
or what we’ve learned from the 
climate survey. There will also 
be a fantastic keynote address 
by perhaps one of the most 
famous senior scholars in this 
area, a professor from Stanford 
named Claude Steele, who came 
up with a theory that has lots 
of support about something he 
calls “stereotype threat.” In 
effect, people internalize what 
the stereotypes are for their 
identity and that internalization 
affects their behavior and can 
self-perpetuate 
that 
identity, 

sometimes unfairly. So it’ll be a 
great talk; I encourage people to 
go.

It’s been a lot of effort — we’ve 

maintained the engagement and 
interest across all the schools 
and colleges, a lot of good initial 
things are happening and there’s 
a long way to go.

TMD: As you mentioned 

campus 
climate 
and 
the 

fact that different students 
have different experiences 
here, is there anything else 
specifically that you would 
say needs further specific 
attention as far as the DEI 
plan or anything that hasn’t 
been up to your standards or 
expectations?

Schlissel: I wish that all 

the things we’re working on 
could go faster. I wish that 
we could more quickly get 
to an environment where 
the quality of everyone’s 
experience is quite similar to 
everyone else’s experience. 
I wish that we wouldn’t be 
derailed by these episodic 
episodes of racism and other 
kinds of hurtful, insulting 
messages in our environment. 
I wish that our campus 
demographic could improve 
more quickly — in other words, 
get a more representative mix 
of students in our society. I 
think we’re making progress

Every Wednesday, The 
Michigan Daily asks a 
University affiliate what the 
University’s Bicentennial 
means to them. 

“I was born and raised in 
Michigan, and so I think it’s 
really cool that, over the past 
200 years, Michigan has stayed 
true to its roots and served 
the people of the community 
while maintaining growth in 
all other areas to become a 
nationally-recognized institute 
for public research, and pushing 
the envelope across all sorts of 
fields while still maintaining its 
connetion to the place it was 
founded in. I think that’s really 
special, and it’s something really 
unique that I’m really proud of 
as a native Michigander.”

proven to have the capability 
to be much faster and use 
significantly 
less 
propellant 

than regular rockets.

“With 
a 
standard 

conventional chemical rocket 
the gas leaving the back might 
be leaving at something like 
4 or 5 kilometers per second. 
Our systems can do 20, 30, 40, 
even over 100 kilometers per 
second of exhaust velocity. And 
that translates into allowing the 
spacecraft to go much faster, 
anywhere from twice to 10 
times as fast as a conventional 
spacecraft can go,” Gallimore 
explained.

With this technology, both 

robotic systems and people have 
the capability to be transported 
from one place to another 
in 
space, 
either 
using 
less 

propellant than a normal rocket 
or traveling there at a much 
faster rate. Both possibilities 
are of interest to NASA and have 
been invested in through the 
Next Step project, which has 
allowed researchers to develop 
these prototypes.

This technology is both 10 

times faster than any engine 
that is currently used in space 
and has broken NASA’s record 
for thruster speed made several 
years ago.

The 
next 
step 
for 
this 

research is to operate a thruster 
at al least 100 kilowatts for 100 
hours continuously. Gallimore 
is optimistic that by 2018, with 

minor 
modifications 
based 

on what they have learned 
from this round of testing, the 
thruster will be capable of going 
much more than 100 hours 
continuously.

Gallimore 
expressed 

appreciation that his research 
can coexist with his roles as 
dean of Engineering and a 
professor.

“One of the things I’m really 

happy about is how research, 
and the education of students 
through research, is something 
that the University of Michigan 
does very well, in comparison to 
many of our peer institutions. I 
am really fortunate as dean to 
be able to demonstrate this in 
person by my own research that 
I still do, and by the fact that I 
have amazing students,” he said.

This 
group 
includes 

Engineering graduate student 
Scott Hall, who worked as a 
research fellow with NASA 
on this project and has been 
offered a position to work at 
center 
where 
he 
conducted 

research 
after 
getting 
his 

Ph.D. He explained the test’s 
importance as the culmination 
of his own work with aerospace 
engineering.

“A pretty large team has 

been working on the project 
since well before I even came to 
grad school. It was an amazing 
experience to be a part of the 
passionate, 
dedicated 
group 

of engineers and technicians 
at NASA that I worked with 
to accomplish this test. I’ll be 
defending my dissertation based 
heavily on that experiment in a 
few weeks,” he said.

those outside of the University 
of Michigan’s borders.

During the first few weeks 

of 
the 
initiative, 
Ashman 

said, CSG paid for the buses 
—about $800 per bus. With 
this, they were able to provide 
one shuttle every other week. 
Eventually, 
Meijer 
noticed 

high interest among students 
using the shuttle and offered 
to 
pay 
for 
the 
program 

themselves, 
which 
allowed 

two shuttles to run every 
week.

This year, however, Meijer 

discontinued funding as they 
begin to join recent trends 
to have groceries delivered 
directly 
to 
homes 
and 

students, so as to compete 

with other delivery services 
such as Amazon.

“They didn’t see the value in 

having a bus bring kids to their 
locations when their real goal 
was to have students order 
the groceries and have them 
delivered to them,” Ashman 
said.

CSG, 
unable 
to 
provide 

funding 
for 
what 
would 

amount to $1,600 per week, 
decided to cut the program 
from their budget. This was 
in order to continue paying 
for other programs such as 
Student Organization Funding 
Commission — which helps 
fund 
student 
organizations 

— as well as financial aid 
support.

“We tossed it around for a 

bit and ultimately decided we 
just couldn’t, we didn’t want 
to start it and stop it and we 

couldn’t eat that cost for a 
whole semester or a whole 
year,” Ashman said. “That was 
going to impact a lot of other 
stuff we wanted to do which 
was 
also 
important 
work. 

We didn’t want to make that 
commitment.”

Though CSG looked into 

other ways to provide students 
with a grocery shuttle, Ann 
Arbor public buses The Ride 
currently allow students direct 
transportation to off-campus 
grocery stores. Engineering 
sophomore Olivia Sun used 
these services last year, and 
said because of the options 
available to students she feels 
the need for a specific shuttle 
from CSG is not as significant.

“I heard about (the CSG 

Meijer shuttle), but I never 
used it,” she said. “I personally 
don’t see (its discontinuation) 

as an inconvenience to myself 
just because I was already able 
to take a (Ride) Bus to Meijer 
… since that bus already goes 
there I don’t see the need for 
there to be a specific shuttle 
just to go to Meijer.”

Addressing food insecurities 

on campus was a large part 
of the Shafer administration 
platform and an issue included 
as part of eMerge’s campaign 
last spring. CSG committees 
are currently working on other 
means to combat the issue, 
such as providing farmers 
markets 
on 
campus 
and 

partnering with dining halls to 
include fresh produce options 
within University dining. 

“We 
certainly 
have 
not 

forgotten about the issues of 
food insecurity and access to 
healthy foods on this campus,” 
Ashman said.

over the past two weeks, 85 
percent of survey respondents 
believe housing in Ann Arbor 
is segregated by income level. 
26 percent of the respondents 
come from families making over 
$220,000 annually, while the 
second largest percentage was 
the 22 percent of respondents 
from families making $120,000 
to $150,000 annually. Less than 11 
percent of respondents come from 
families making less than $60,000 
per year.

In 2016, Michigan’s median 

household income was $52,492 
— a stark contrast to the median 
household income of $154,000 for 
University of Michigan students. 
Additionally, 
9.3 
percent 
of 

students’ families make upwards 
of $630,000 per year.

Willian further noted housing is 

segregated by student preferences, 
rather than solely by family income. 
She emphasized how athletes often 
choose to live by their practice 
facilities, most commonly in the 
Yost neighborhood, rather than 
other neighborhoods off-campus.

“I would also say housing is 

definitely segregated by where 

students prefer to live in addition 
to what they can afford,” she said. 
“To my understanding, many of 
the athletes live closer to where 
their practices are held. I live on 
South U near Central Campus, 
in a location that is close to my 
classes. I don’t really have to go 
near the sports complexes besides 
for on game day so I wouldn’t like 
to live too far away from Central. 
I also chose this location because 
there are many other apartment 
complexes in a close vicinity and 
a lot of the friends I made last year 
live in this area too.”

Engineering junior Siddharth 

Ramesh 
further 
supported 

this, stating though Ann Arbor 
certainly has an issue with 
expensive housing, he believes 
housing is expensive across the 
map — rather than segregated by 
certain neighborhoods.

“When I first started the 

search for a place off campus 
I 
was 
astonished 
by 
how 

expensive every place was. I 
would say that yes, housing off 
campus is segregated by price, 
but I think the primary factor 
is proximity to campus,” he 
said. “Apartments and houses 
closer to campus are a lot 
more 
expensive, 
apartments 

especially, and then they get 

cheaper as you go farther out.”

Ramesh said his hunt for 

housing was based around his 
own personal preferences, as 
he knew he would be paying a 
large amount for monthly rent 
regardless of location.

“Once I reconciled myself 

with the fact that I was going 
to be paying close to $1,000 per 
month for housing, I think my 
primary factors in determining 
where to live was how far the 
house was from where I studied 
plus from where my roommates 
studied plus area of common 
spaces plus food options near 
by,” he said.

The median rate for rent in 

Ann Arbor increased 14 percent 
from 2010 to 2015, reaching 
$1,075 per month — even as the 
amount of high-density housing 
has jumped by 32 percent — 
according to the U.S. Census 
Bureau. However, this data is for 
the entire city and may not be 
reflective of the cost of housing 
for students specifically, most of 
which are clustered downtown.

In fact, the survey showed 

the average monthly rent of 
respondents to be approximately 
$772.

Rather 
than 
living 
in 
a 

neighborhood after freshman 

year, many students choose 
to instead live in one of the 
numerous luxury apartments 
scattered across Ann Arbor, 
such as Landmark or Foundry 
Lofts. However, with monthly 
rates going for upwards of 
$1,000 per person, depending 
on the size of the apartment, 
these apartments only cater to a 
certain percentage of the student 
body. As developers constructed 
these high-rises in the center 
of the city, they touted the 
benefits of bringing an influx of 
wealth to the area. Furthermore, 
they 
initially 
believed 
the 

construction of such buildings 
would cause rental prices for 
houses further from campus to 
drop — a phenomenon that has 
not yet been proven.

In an interview with the 

Ann Arbor News in 2012, local 
commercial real estate agent 
Peter Allen said though the 
apartments are expensive, the 
average University student can 
afford to pay for convenience 
and extra amenities.

“The profile of students can 

afford these super ammenized, 
very convenient locations,” he said.

in all these areas but I share 
the 
frustration 
effort 
from 

many students and also faculty 
and staff that it’s just too slow. 
Change isn’t fast enough.

TMD: Specifically to that 

point, 
there 
was 
Tabbye 

Chavous, 
the 
director 
of 

the 
National 
Center 
for 

Institutional Diversity, who was 
quoted back in February saying 
that “this Fall will likely have 
an appreciable difference on our 
faculty (in terms of diversity).” 
How are things on that front?

numbers.

I’m sure, does. But programs 
are up and running in each of 
the schools and colleges that 
are designed to purposefully 
increase the diversity of the 
faculty, to use legal means, but 
to purposefully look for scholars 
that enhance the study of or the 
environment for diversity and 
inclusion on campus.

One of the programs that 

I think is the most robust 
is happening in our largest 
college, 
in 
LSA, 
there’s 
a 

postdoc 
program. 
Postdocs 

are potential faculty members 
who have already finished their 
Ph.D. They’re not quite ready 
necessarily for an independent 
faculty position but they come 
and work at the University for a 
year or two, they do a little bit of 
teaching, they continue working 
on their scholarship, and if their 
career progresses, we have an 
assistant 
professor’s 
position 

waiting for them. LSA began a 
program as part of their diversity 
plan to set aside quite a number 
of these postdoctoral slots for 
scholars that would help us 
either with the study of diversity 
or in building a more diverse and 
equitable community. They’re 
making good progress on that, 
so that’s an example, but I don’t 
have the numbers to share with 
you.

There’s a lot of information in 

this and I’m still absorbing the 
information. We’ll have plenty 
of time at the diversity summit 
to actually discuss and answer 
questions about the information, 
and then the data will be made 
available so that individuals can 
look at the data and draw some of 
their own conclusions.

TMD: One of the things we 

wanted to address was your 
support for undocumented and 
immigrant students, specifically 
at the Regents meeting earlier 
this month. What has come out of 
the immigration working group? 
Has there been any progress on 
requests from students, such as 
liaisons, or financial aid? Where 
are we with that?

Schlissel: This immigration 

working group continues to 
function. 
It 
interacts 
with 

both 
individuals 
and 
then 

organizations 
representing 

groups of individuals. It has 

received a bunch of requests 
most recently from students in 
support of our DACA students, 
and a number of these things 
have been put into place. It’s 
mainly making sure that our 
entire community that is subject 
to these changes in immigration 
rules and regulations knows 
where to turn for information 
and knows where to turn when 
they need help. So we continue 
to improve our ways of making 
it easier for people to reach out 
and to know who to reach out 
to. But the important thing from 
the University perspective is we 
wouldn’t be Michigan without 
being a magnet for people from 
all around the world — and at all 
levels: faculty, staff and students. 
For students, we’re committed 
to all the students that are here, 
helping them achieve their life 
ambition. As a lifelong educator, 
the notion that somebody wants 
to make their life and their 
family’s lives better by getting 
educated — there’s nothing more 
worthy of support than that. 
We’re at the stage now, though, 
where also our professional 
organizations 
are 
lobbying 

Congress to come up with a 
more definitive solution to the 
DACA situation. So the DACA 
was a set of regulations that, you 
saw from recent events, could 
be overturned. The government 
changes, 
you 
overturn 
the 

regulations. The hope is to turn 
the DACA situation into a law — 
an act of Congress — that will 
give long-term assurance and 
stability to young people that are 
in the DACA category.

The other thing that really 

weighs on me is 20 percent of the 
Michigan faculty was born outside 
the United States. Just think of 
the advantage that our University 
and our country has by being a 
magnet for talent from all around 
the world. Why would we want 
to give that up? Why wouldn’t 
we want talented, hardworking 
people to come here and join our 
country and contribute to our 
shared wealth? So that’s why 
the immigration issue is really 
important for the University.

TMD: Shifting gears toward 

C.C. Little. So there’s an advisory 
committee for its renaming. What 
progress has been made in that 

committee, what have the main 
considerations been, and what 
does the timeline look like?

Schlissel: As you know because 

you published this, there has 
been a formal request, very well 
documented, made by a group of 
students with some faculty help — 
or maybe for my faculty colleagues 
I should say faculty with some 
student help — making a request 
that we consider removing the 
name. C.C. Little, of course, is a 
former president of the University 
and it’s a big deal. A year ago, 
we had a committee that has 
existed for a while called the 
President’s Advisory Committee 
on University History go through 
a discussion to advise us about 
what are the criteria we should 
use when these kind of questions 
come up. So that was before we 
ever got the C.C. Little question or 
Winchill — another former faculty 
member who has a hall named 
after them — where the question 
has also been raised over whether 
that naming is appropriate. So 
this committee spent a number 
of months saying what are the 
criteria we should use to judge 
these cases, how do we even think 
about a request to change a name? 
They came up with a bunch of 
recommended principles — those 
are posted up on my website for 
the whole community to see. And 
they’re a very valuable guide for 
how we deal with the proposal 
that was raised with C.C. Little. 
So what I did when I got the 
request for the Little naming was 
first look at the overall request to 
make sure it seems serious to me 
and detailed enough to forward 
to the committee and I thought 
it was and the committee agreed. 
The committee has been working 
on this request now for a few 
months. What they’ve been trying 
to do is apply their criteria to this 
particular question.

For example, one of the more 

interesting 
and 
challenging 

criteria is: You can imagine there 
are many ideas that in today’s 
context seem ridiculous, that 
they’re so out of step with our 
current values and the current 
social norms in our society that 
they make no sense. 


T

his is a man’s world. 
Despite 
all 
the 

accolades women have 

won and the inequalities we 
continue to work 
against, women still 
receive 
deplorable 

treatment and are 
usually left with less 
than they deserve. 

It’s evident in the 

scandal of Harvey 
Weinstein, 
who 

used his wealth and 
power to intimidate 
young female actors 
and make them feel 
like they had no 
choice but to do what he wanted. 
Weinstein then paid off his 
victims to keep them quiet and 
leave his reputation untainted 
in the public’s eyes. It’s evident 
in 
the 
continuous 
gender 

wage gap despite the fact that 
women are more likely to have 
a bachelor’s degree. It’s evident 
in the feeling of needing to 
have a makeshift weapon ready 
when walking alone at night and 
getting catcalled on the streets.

Sexism is ingrained in every 

part of our culture, and we 
can see and hear it play out 
especially well in hip hop. This 
is not a new discovery — we’ve 
known that hip hop has been 
criticized for its misogynistic 
lyrics in the past, and artists 
continue to perpetuate sexism. 
While hip hop artists have 
begun to reflect on how lyrics 
contribute to misogyny and 
create songs that do not focus 
on the objectification of women, 
radios still play songs with slyer 
hints of sexism.

We 
should 
expect 
more 

from this industry, but its 
representation of women is not 
surprising 
considering 
how 

male-dominated it is. According 
to Forbes, only one out of the 20 
highest paid hip-hop artists of 

2017 is a woman. That woman, 
Nicki Minaj, has some words for 
the industry.

On Oct. 25, Minaj released 

a series of tweets 
showing 
how 

undervalued she feels 
as an artist because 
she is also a woman.

Who 
society 

typically pictures as 
a rapper or hip hop 
artist is very different 
from Minaj. The image 
of a rapper is typically 
a man who is tough 
and 
intimidating, 

who wears his wealth 

on his sleeve and who says 
whatever he feels, no matter if 
it is offensive or crass. Society is 
not used to and not comfortable 
with women who display some 
of these characteristics; women 
who are assertive, outspoken or 
speak about taboo subjects, as 
Minaj does, are not embraced by 
society in the same way as men.

In one tweet Minaj notes that 

the discussion of “The Greats” 
often 
ignores 
women. 
Just 

type in “Greatest Rappers of 
all Time” in Google; there are 
only a few women mentioned. 
Some lists will include Minaj, 
Lauryn Hill, Salt-N-Pepa and 
Missy Elliot, but there’s no 
mention of other rappers like 
Queen Latifah or Lisa “Left 
Eye” Lopes.

Minaj elaborated on sexism 

in hip hop in 2014 during an 
interview with Hot 97.

“The game is run by men,” 

Minaj says in the clip. “Men 
feels like it takes something 
away from them to give a female 
props the way they would give 
Jay or Kanye or Em.”

In the interview, Minaj also 

points out the use of qualifiers 
as exceptions. “Don’t say I’m 
good for a girl,” Minaj tells 
the radio DJ. This is exhibited 

throughout 
our 
society, 

because when talking about 
public figures like artists or 
politicians, people often put 
“female” before their job title. 
No one does the same thing for 
men. There is no need to always 
use 
“female 
rapper” 
when 

talking about Nicki Minaj or 
other rappers like Cardi B.

Minaj also calls out the DJ for 

mainly playing tracks by Minaj 
that feature male artists. She 
can’t exist as her own entity; she 
has to have a man on her track or 
be featured on a track by a man. 
But clearly that is not the case 
 
— her songs “Super Bass” and 
“Starships” did just fine without 
featuring a male artist.

In addition to having the 

confidence often associated 
with maleness, Minaj is also 
very creative. She’s not just 
one artist — she has various 
alter egos. She’s not just 
changing hip hop because 
she’s a female. She’s changing 
hip hop because she is unique 
and crafts lyrics that become 
massive parts of our society — 
no one can forget “Anaconda.”

The 
influence 
of 
rappers 

like Nicki Minaj and Cardi B 
is undeniable, whether people 
want to recognize it or not. 
There’s no way to escape hearing 
lines from “Bodak Yellow,” the 
longest running number one 
song by a solo “female rapper,” 
on any popular radio station. 
Hopefully, the success of Cardi B 
and Minaj will make executives 
and 
producers 
change 
the 

demographics of rap. Perhaps 
then 
rappers 
like 
Princess 

Nokia, Noname and Sampa the 
Great will come to the forefront, 
actually get air time and replace 
the tired lyrics that objectify or 
criticize women. 

L

ast week, the United 
States Navy announced 
the redeployment of the 

aircraft carrier U.S.S. Nimitz 
from the Middle East to the 
Pacific Ocean, where it will 
join two other carriers already 
stationed there. Its arrival marks 
the first time since 2007 that the 
U.S. has positioned three carrier 
strike groups in the region 
and represents an intriguing 
development in the escalation of 
tensions between the U.S. and 
North Korea. 

Despite 
the 
Navy’s 

unremarkable announcement of 
the Nimitz’s redeployment, the 
move drew considerable media 
attention, 
as 
most 
defense 

experts believe the presence 
of 
multiple 
carrier 
strike 

groups is a critical prerequisite 
for any preemptive military 
action against North Korea. 
Furthermore, 
the 
carrier’s 

arrival 
coincides 
with 
the 

deployment of other advanced 
warships to East Asia and comes 
amid reports that the Pentagon 
is considering putting nuclear 
bomber planes on 24-hour alert.

These developments would 

likely be less scrutinized if not 
for the incendiary rhetoric of 
President Donald Trump and 
others in his administration. 
Though nearly three months 
have 
passed 
since 
Trump 

threatened to strike North Korea 
with “fire and fury like the 
world has never seen,” tensions 
remain high. In his address 
to the U.N. General Assembly, 
Trump mocked Kim Jong-un as 
a “little rocket man” and again 
threatened military conflict.

Though 
widely 
criticized 

as extreme and 
aggressive, 

Trump’s 
sentiments 
were 

reinvigorated by Nikki Haley, 
the U.S. Ambassador to the 
U.N., who assured that the “fire 
and fury” remarks were “not 
an empty threat.” North Korea 
has responded with its own 
provocations, including threats 
to attack Guam, “ruin” the 
U.S. military and develop the 
world’s most powerful nuclear 
weapons. Though North Korea’s 
bluster is nothing new, under 
previous administrations, the 
U.S. typically declined to retort.

Unfortunately, the bellicosity 

of Trump, Haley and others in 
Trump’s 
administration 
has 

often 
overshadowed 
cooler 

heads. For example, Defense 

Secretary James Mattis has 
emphasized 
the 
resolute 

unwillingness of the U.S. to 
accept a nuclear North Korea 
while 
acknowledging 
the 

“catastrophic” consequences of 
war. Mattis is right — war with 
North Korea would indubitably 
be severely destructive and 
possibly result in upward of 
millions of (mostly civilian) 
deaths and trillions of dollars in 
economic damage.

There is no simple military 

solution to North Korea; any 
military invention is certain 
to be massive, lengthy and 
costly. 
Yet, 
alarmingly, 
the 

public statements of Trump 
and 
many 
of 
his 
advisers 

suggest a disconnect between 
his administration’s vision of a 
potential war and the actualities 
of military intervention. In the 
same interview in which Haley 
defended Trump’s “fire and 
fury” remarks, she curtly stated 
that if diplomatic solutions 
failed, “General Mattis will take 
care of it.” Likewise, at his U.N. 
speech, Trump declared that 
the U.S. may have “no choice 
but to totally destroy North 
Korea,” implying the existence 
of a straightforward, painless 
military solution.

Both 
Haley 
and 
Trump’s 

comments reveal a deeply flawed 
and 
objectively 
inaccurate 

perception that military conflict 
with North Korea would be easy 
and fruitful. Perhaps even more 
frustrating, 
their 
comments 

demonstrate a profound failure to 
learn from the U.S.’s recent history 
of repeated foreign policy blunders. 
This is most analogous to military 
interventions in Iraq and Vietnam, 
where unrealistic expectations 
and the absence of clear long-term 
objectives drew the U.S. into long 
and costly conflicts.

This is not to diminish the 

threat posed by North Korea 
nor to contend that military 

intervention 
is 
categorically 

unwarranted, 
but 
rather 

to suggest that the current 
situation with North Korea is 
a delicate issue that requires 
thought and level-headedness. 
Defense concerns surrounding 
North Korea are legitimate; 
the CIA believes North Korea 
is merely months away from 
realizing the ability to strike 
the U.S. mainland with nuclear 
weapons. Given North Korea’s 
reputation for aggression and 
unpredictability, it must be 
prevented from attaining this 
capacity at all costs.

The 
U.S. 
must 
also 
be 

prepared for, and willing to 
implement, military solutions 
should the situation deteriorate 
to the point where there are no 
other options. However, any 
military solution to North Korea 
must be recognized for what 
it is: a costly, unideal and last-
resort option to counter a direct 
threat to national security.

Trump’s 
willingness 
to 

respond 
to 
North 
Korea’s 

rhetoric and issue dramatic 
threats of his own is troublesome. 
The rapid escalation of tensions 
and series of North Korean 
weapons testing over the past 
few months has shown that 
Trump’s bombastic comments 
serve to embolden, rather than 
intimidate, North Korea.

Though one could argue 

Trump’s 
brash 
and 
direct 

persona 
has 
paid 
political 

dividends, this style is ill-suited 
for crafting effective foreign 
policy. Foreign policy decisions 
are often not easy nor easily 
undone, and their consequences 
are often irreversible, which 
just serves to underscore the 
importance of approaching such 
decisions 
with 
considerable 

thought and care. On the matter 
of North Korea, Trump’s bluster 
has only further destabilized an 
already precarious situation.

Trump is set to embark on 

an overseas trip to East Asia 
soon, which will include a visit 
to South Korea. Undoubtedly, 
the president will face many 
questions from world leaders 
and 
international 
media 

regarding tensions with North 
Korea; it would do him and the 
U.S. well to embrace nuance 
over bluster when he answers.

O

n my family’s annual 
hibernal sojourn to visit 
family in the Northeast, 

I wore a red T-shirt I bought 
online 
from 
an 
American 

Apparel sale. The front read: 
“Legalize 
LA!” 
We 
always 

took 
the 
shortcut 
through 

Canada, which required us to 
go through customs. While 
the 
customs 
officer 
was 

checking our passports, he 
noticed my shirt. “What does 
that mean?” My parents and I 
abruptly explained to him that 
he needn’t worry about this 
sartorial protest. 

Flash forward a few years. 

Now a junior in college, I have 
the liberty to explore Ann 
Arbor at will. I walked down 
Liberty Street and noticed signs 
that indicated the campus’s 
American Apparel closure. Once 
summer passed, store operations 
ceased, and now all that remains 
is an empty storefront. So long 
to my adolescent years of trying 
to emulate the aesthetics of 
alternative culture.

American Apparel was an 

instance in which we could 
have 
been 
more 
conscious 

consumers. 
If 
we 
first 

acknowledge 
the 
process 

behind a product being made 
and ways companies utilize 
messaging 
to 
keep 
their 

respected place, we will be able 
to avoid supporting business 
practices that hurt others.

Recently I have been thinking 

about how certain economic 
and political actions end up 
contributing 
to 
injustices, 

whether or not these acts 
are 
intentional. 
Things 
we 

buy, statements we make and 
brands we associate with can 
have dire consequences if we 
do not address how we may be 
oppressing others by our tacit 
support. In today’s discourse 
surrounding 
women 
and 

immigrants, a need to reconsider 
these attitudes becomes even 
more urgent.

The 
red 
T-shirt 
I 
wore 

through 
customs 
probably 

would not have prevented me 
from re-entering the country, 
yet this experience does not 
compare to those of students at 
this university who are directly 
affected 
by 
dramatic 
shifts 

in immigration policy. When 

I wore that red T-shirt as I 
crossed the border, I intended it 
to be a show of support for the 
rights of immigrants.

This pro-immigrant stance 

mirrored that of the ex-owner 
of the company I bought the 
shirt from. Dov Charney, a 
Canadian-born 
entrepreneur, 

started American Apparel in 
the late 1990s. It blossomed into 
the quintessential hipster brand 
for the licentious youth to buy a 
plain T-shirt for upwards of $30 
— until recently.

American Apparel clothing 

was made in Los Angeles by a 
multicultural production staff, 
paid fair wages and provided 
transparency 
in 
company 

practices. The company embraced 
progressive attitudes toward gay 
rights and advocated on behalf 
of their workers for immigration 
reform, seen in their Legalize Gay 
and Legalize LA social justice 
campaigns, 
respectively. 
This 

platform drew many customers 
to support American Apparel’s 
mission and became profitable by 
doing so.

However, 
these 
utopian 

visions 
were 
met 
with 
a 

divergent 
reality. 
Workers 

complained 
about 
factory 

conditions. 
There 
were 

numerous sexual harassment 
allegations against Charney, and 
their ads routinely objectified 
women. The company dismissed 
undocumented 
employees, 

and lawsuits followed in swift 
succession, which soon turned 
Charney from a visionary to 
a serial nuisance. American 
Apparel’s board let Charney 
go and the hopes and dreams 
of innovation and patriotism 
which Charney instilled into the 
brand soon followed.

Perhaps if consumers knew 

this background they would 

not give the company their 
unequivocal support. Thinking 
they were helping end one 
oppression, they had no idea 
what was actually occurring 
behind 
company 
doors. 

Whether or not the increased 
number 
of 
allegations 
was 

either correlative or causative 
with 
American 
Apparel’s 

bankruptcy, a company board 
and media attention found no 
friend in Charney.

The past few weeks in culture 

and politics have brought forth 
revelations our country has never 
dared 
discuss. 
The 
damning 

reports in The New York Times 
and The New Yorker regarding 
Hollywood 
producer 
Harvey 

Weinstein’s long history of sexual 
harassment and assault have 
catalyzed a societal dialogue 
captured in social media with the 
now-trending #MeToo.

With victims speaking out with 

such velocity and innumerability, 
there is no way to dispute that 
harassment and actions far worse 
are endemic within companies. 
Unfortunately, most of the time 
consumers are left in the dark 
because 
companies 
attempt 

to 
conceal 
these 
allegations 

from the public. For publicly 
traded companies like American 
Apparel, how can shareholders 
keep 
executives 
accountable 

when 
there 
is 
not 
even 

accountability among the highest 
orders of authority? These dark 
secrets are shrouded under a veil 
of misinformation, like American 
Apparel’s marketing campaign 
promoting equality.

Much 
has 
changed 
from 

when I first bought my T-shirt at 
American Apparel, and I’m not 
sure if simply wearing this shirt 
really helped the causes I was 
trying to support. Maybe taking 
concrete action would have been 
a better tactic than trying to 
look cool. And under this false 
premise of political awareness and 
expression, I thought I was giving 
others a voice who needed one.

My lesson has been learned. 

Do your research. One kind of 
oppression does not substitute 
for another. Recognize all 
the 
implications 
of 
your 

financial decisions.

DOGGYSTYLE RECORDS

I want a Martha Stewart feature on the next one
What happened, Snoop?

We want the old Snoop back on ‘Make America Crip Again’

Snoooooooop (cue “Drop It 

Like It’s Hot” background vocals)! 
Snoooooooop! Snoop? Snoop?! 

If you’re looking for Snoop Dogg, 

Snoop Doggy Dogg, The D-O-
double-G or any classic incarnation 
of the legendary G-Funk rapper 
who ignited the hip-hop world with 
his sly voice and swagger-oozing 
flow, you will not find him on Make 
America Crip Again. Instead, you’ll 
find an artist in the midst of an 
identity crisis, so torn between the 
worlds of old and new hip hop that 
he was forced to release a project 
full of contradictions, as undefined 
and insecure as 2017 Snoop himself.

In general, Make America Crip 

Again is an EP meant to embrace 
and 
celebrate 
Black 
culture 

in the midst of racial struggle 
under controversial leadership. 
Lines like, “Them black boys is 
balling out, the whole block been 
eating,” and, “The world is yours 
nigga, so go and see that bitch,” 
certainly elicit a positive message 
meant to encourage and celebrate 
Black Americans, and Snoop’s 
motivation behind the album is 
certainly commendable. However, 
as an artistic project, the laudable 
characteristics of Make America 
Crip Again do not extend further 
than intention, and listeners are left 
with an outdated and insubstantial 
collection of songs under the name 
of one of rap’s former greats.

Snoop’s Make America Crip 

Again lacks in two major areas: 
Message and music — two of the 
most basic categories regarding 
album quality.

Given that the EP’s title is 

a play on President Trump’s 
fabled slogan, “Make America 
Great Again,” one would think 
the album tends towards the 
political; it does, but in ways that 
are at times contradictory. On the 

album’s opener, “M.A.C.A.,” Snoop 
preaches 
about 
uniting 
Black 

communities across boundaries of 
color and creed with the lines, “Now 
just imagine if we stop shooting our 
own kind / I’m a Crip with no color 
lines, that mean I’m colorblind.” At 
face value, there is nothing wrong 
with these lines — an end to futile 
intraracial crime is an important 
emphasis in socially conscious hip 
hop. However, this message hits 
a wall when met with lines like, 
“Me and my homies gangbang on 
the field,” and, “Locked in, locked 
out / Talk shit, get socked out,” 
that only seem to emphasize and 
encourage the senseless violence 
and prideful disputes within Black 
communities that Snoop originally 

derode. This contradiction, though 
sometimes common in rap, feels 
particularly odd here. His assertion 
of dominance and competition 
seems counterintuitive to Snoop’s 
moral of solidarity. 

Even the title, Make America Crip 

Again, lends itself to a contradiction 
with 
the 
rapper’s 
supposed 

message of unity — can Snoop 
preach togetherness with an album 
title built on the inherently violent 
bipolarity of gang violence and 
drug wars within urban centers? 
The album cover is also entirely 
blue, only further muddying the 
waters of Snoop’s claims. Though 
many argue that the prevalence 
of gangs in urban centers may 
provide a sense of community for 
Black Americans who need it most, 
the support of such inherently 
competitive organizations does 
not quite align with Snoop’s 
initial 
“drop 
your 
weapons” 

message — even the most inclusive 
gangs still battle rival gangs; the 
rapper’s “colorblindness” is only 
superficially encouraged. If Snoop 
really wanted to profess solidarity 
within 
Black 
communities, 

perhaps ditching the Crip support 
in favor of a more unified and 
consistent theme would have been 
more effective.

Musically, 
Make 
America 

Crip Again is forced and simply 
misses the mark. Snoop, who 
made headlines a few months 
ago for hilariously impersonating 
trap rappers and exposing the 
lack of originality in today’s rap 
surprisingly became exactly what 
he spoke out against. The music 
is just not suited for the Snoop we 
know and love; the straightforward, 
booming beats dilute the rapper’s 
charming tendency to sit back on 
the beat and swing his rhymes. 
Instead, listeners are jarred with 
far too simple and concise lines 
hidden behind slight autotune that 
lack wordplay and mirror the likes 
of Future and Playboi Carti.

Snoop obviously pigeon-holed 

himself with his latest project, 
and in doing so he became 
something we never wanted him 
to be. With an unclear message 
and an unappealing music array, 
Make America Crip Again is a 
failed project, and Snoop is clearly 
struggling to keep up with the 
rapidly evolving hip hop world. 
Instead of grasping at straws to 
become the next Future, Snoop 
should take a step back and 
embrace his role as The D-O-
double-G, the funky and spunky 
Long Beach rapper who developed 
G-Funk and famously encouraged 
us to stay “laid back.” We’ve seen 
flashes of classic Snoop Doggy 
Dogg in recent years — just listen 
to his verse on “Institutionalized” 
by Kendrick Lamar and you’ll be 
sucked back into the height of West 
Coast rap in the ’90s. The sooner 
Snoop returns to this form with his 
solo projects, the better.

Danny McBride stars in HBO’s “Vice Principals”
Danny McBride & David 
Gordon Green of ‘Vice 
Principals’ chat with us

“We like to design our projects 

to be able to be consumed in one 
hungover afternoon.”

This is the opinion of Danny 

McBride, the creator and star of 
HBO’s “Vice Principals.” Now 
in its second and final season, 
the black comedy continues the 
saga of Neal Gamby (McBride), 
a man determined to become 
the Principal of North Jackson 
High 
School 
by 
whatever 

means necessary. He competes 
mercilessly 
with 
his 
rivals 

 
— namely, his more popular 
Co-Vice Principal Lee Russell. 
At the end of season one, Gamby 
is shot by a faceless villain in a 
mysterious mask.

Season two picks up the pieces, 

and then tears them apart. It’s 
uncomfortable, outrageous and 
very funny. 

The Michigan Daily spoke 

with McBride and David Gordon 
Green, a frequent director on the 
show and an executive producer. 
McBride and Gordon Green 
shared insight into the process, 
the current season and how they 
got where they are today.

This 
isn’t 
their 
first 

collaboration. 
The 
pair 
also 

worked on “Eastbound & Down,” 
a comedy about a failed pro-
baseball player turned substitute 
gym teacher. Clearly, something 
about small-town high school 
administrators 
and 
teachers 

inspires 
both 
McBride 
and 

Gordon Green.

“I was a substitute teacher for a 

little bit,” McBride said. “I always 
thought it was so fascinating how 
there’s one world going on with 
the students and then there’s 
a completely different world 
going on with the teachers and 
administrators … rarely did those 
two sides get a full understanding 
of the other one.”

The duality of these worlds 

is 
very 
prevalent 
in 
“Vice 

Principals.” Choosing to set a 
story in a setting as specific as 
North Jackson High School and 
to center the plot line on two 

men “jockeying for the head of 
that world” is a tried and true 
storytelling 
device. 
McBride 

himself admits that it’s a “classic 
quest for the crown story.” For 
Neal Gamby and Lee Russell, 
the fight for Principal of North 
Jackson is akin to Macbeth’s 
bloodthirsty quest to be King.

These 
characters, 
though 

ambitious in their own rights, are 
incredibly flawed protagonists. 
Neal Gamby, for example, is ill-
tempered, 
short-sighted 
and 

dictatorial in nearly all aspects of 
his life. Yet somehow a successful 
two-season, 18-episode story has 
been created around Gamby and 
his cohorts. How? McBride feels 
like “it has to do a lot with being 
able to understand them. And 
understand them doesn’t mean 
making excuses for them, I think 
it means you can understand that 
someone is a terrible person and 
still not be endorsing them.”

Grounding 
his 
fictional 

character in reality is easy, he 
explains, because, “that’s how 
people are in life anyways. It’s 
very easy to write people off or 
have people be defined by their 
worst attributes.”

Creating a balance between 

a 
flawed 
and 
sympathetic 

protagonist is what they worked 
hardest on in the writing. Citing 
both Gamby and Russell, McBride 
notes, “we’re always trying to 
do is make these characters 
feel like they’re real, for better 
or for worse.” And with a show 
like “Vice Principals,” where for 
worse is taken hyper-literally, 
this is incredibly important.

The ability to successfully 

pull off a character like Gamby 
is a sign of good writing and 
great 
collaboration. 
Evident 

in the interview is the healthy 
balance in McBride and Gordon 
Green’s working relationship — 
as collaborators, peers, friends. 
The pair, plus Jody Hill, who 
co-created both “Eastbound & 
Down” and “Vice Principals,” 
have been working together since 
first meeting in the dorms of the 
University of North Carolina 
School of the Arts.

McBride reminisced on what 

inspired the partnership.

“I saw David’s short film. 

He was a year ahead of me, 
and it was a first-year student 
film,” McBride said. “It was 
called, ‘Will You Lather Up My 
Roughhouse’ and it ended with 
two men … taking a bath together 
and singing. I saw it and I said, I 
want to make stuff with this guy.”

They’ve made quite a few 

things 
together 
— 
usually 

comedies. 
Recently, 
however, 

Gordon Green and McBride have 
forayed into a new genre: horror.

“The world is such a strange 

and evolving — often off-putting 
— place that I think if I was just 
trying to live in the melancholy 
side of my interests, it wouldn’t be 
healthy,” Gordon Green said. He 
counters, however, adding that 
he and Danny are “working on a 
horror film [“Halloween”] trying 
to step in a new direction. It’s 
important to always be evolving 
and trying something new.”

The 
opportunity 
to 

experiment and try new genres 
is facilitated by a strong team of 
creative partners. What makes 
“Vice Principals” unique and 
likeable is the unified vision 
for the piece, and the cohesive 
understanding of each uniquely 
flawed character. The strength 
of the show comes through in the 
direction and execution of darkly 
funny plotlines. At the end of the 
day, however, it works because 
it’s created by a group of friends 
doing what inspires them, and 
working to inspire each other.

Gordon 
Green 
emphasizes 

how special it is to work with 
close friends.

“It’s cool to think of these 

relationships as family, as we’ve 
grown and learned and tried to 
challenge each other in lot of 
ways,” he said. “You always know 
with this group of collaborators 
that you could walk out on a limb 
… the world could reject you but 
your friends will always be there 
pushing you to be creative, and 
pushing you to enjoy what you do 
for a living.”

Vice 
Principals 
currently 

airs on HBO. The series finale is 
November 12th, 2017.

A Thanksgiving narrative 
finds new footing in gloom

Feldman’s latest novel challenges its characters and the genre

BOOK REVIEW

It would be quite an endeavor 

to find a piece of literature to 
which the descriptor “Great 
American 
Thanksgiving 

Novel” 
could 
be 
applied. 

Thanksgiving narratives are 
usually reserved for television 
or the silver screen; most 
often, they either boil down 
to 
tales 
of 
dysfunctional 

families and their bumbling 
misadventures (think “Planes, 
Trains & Automobiles”) or 
heartwarming 
reflections 

(more 
“A 
Charlie 
Brown 

Thanksgiving”) on the “true 
meaning” of a holiday where 
actually 
giving 
thanks 
is 

quickly 
overshadowed 
by 

overeating and then passing 
out while watching the annual 
Macy’s parade or Lions game. 
With his sophomore novel 

“Start Without Me,” however, 
author Joshua Max Feldman 
aims to translate the classic 
Thanksgiving 
story 
to 
the 

page 
while 
simultaneously 

abandoning 
all 
of 
its 

conventional hallmarks.

The unfamiliar lens through 

which “Start Without Me” 
explores 
the 
traditional 

Thanksgiving 
familial 

gathering 
is 
immediately 

made evident by its main 
characters. 
Adam 
is 
a 

recovering 
alcoholic 
whose 

bygone career as a bandmate 
and its accompanying rockstar 
lifestyle left him a shell of the 
vivacious musical prodigy he 
once was, and Marissa is an 
overworked flight attendant 
whose 
troubled 
marriage 

hangs by a very flimsy thread. 
On one cold Thanksgiving Day, 
Adam has already abandoned 
yet another family get-together 
that he was invited to after 

sobering up and convincing 
them 
he’d 
changed, 
and 

Marissa is distraught by the 
knowledge that she is pregnant 
from 
an 
impetuous 
one-

night stand with 
her 
high-school 

boyfriend. In spite 
of all that, a chance 
meeting of these 
two 
imperfect 

strangers 
at 
an 

airport 
hotel 

restaurant is the 
beginning of their 
unlikely 
odyssey 

across 
New 

England 
as 
they 

both 
attempt 
to 

come to terms with 
their past and make sense of 
the future that lies ahead of 
them.

Marissa’s 
attempt 
to 

chauffeur Adam back to his 
family is quickly thrown off 
course by a confrontational 

run-in with Adam’s sister at 
a gas station, where Adam is 
directly convinced that no one 
in his family was ready for him 
to appear in their lives again. So, 
the pair decide to try their luck 
with the Thanksgiving meal 
that Marissa has been dreading 

to 
attend. 

The 
following 

extended 
scene 

at the Russells’ 
(Marissa’s 
husband’s family) 
progressively 
ramps 
up 
in 

tension, 
yet 

feels 
somewhat 

contrived 
just 

for 
the 
sake 

of 
discussing 

complex subjects 
like race, gender, 

sexuality and class. Marissa’s 
in-laws are quite a unique couple 
(a Black man and a Jewish 
woman firmly ensconced in 
the upper class), but it appears 
that Feldman only writes in 
these diverse characters and 

their interactions with Marissa 
and Adam to shoehorn in 
dialogue that addresses the 
aforementioned 
contentious 

topics. 
Although 
the 
novel 

falters at points like those, it 
shines when it shifts its focus 
toward Adam and Marissa’s 
attempts to deal with questions 
of love and choice while they 
are both at rock bottom.

The 
best 
scenes 
in 

“Start 
Without 
Me” 

highlight 
characters 
whose 

Thanksgivings are as glum 
as those of he two main 
characters: 
a 
disgruntled 

waitress whose mother just 
passed away, a husband who 
would rather spend his holiday 
camped out in front of Walmart, 
Marissa’s deadbeat mom and 
her new pothead boyfriend. 
Even the Russells barely act 
like a family, as they would 
rather find a random man on 
Craigslist 
to 
prepare 
their 

meal and have a photographer 
take faux candids instead of 
actually loving each other and 

coming to terms with what it 
truly means to be a family. By 
concentrating on these flawed 
characters instead of the cheery 
and happy people that normally 
populate Thanksgiving stories, 
Feldman is able to nail themes 
of loneliness and depression by 
juxtaposing them with a holiday 
centered around togetherness.

The dichotomy between two 

of 
the 
Thanksgiving 
meals 

consumed during the novel — 
an 
undercooked, 
pre-made, 

so-called feast and a cold bucket 
of KFC — are illustrative. 
People can either maintain an 
insecure façade while brushing 
their problems under the rug, 
or they can embrace who they 
really are and proudly display 
that person to others, especially 
their family members. While 
“Start Without Me” wraps up 
a little too quickly and neatly 
without fully developing its 
ideas, it is an introspective read 
that explores the struggles to 
know and to accept one’s true 
self.

George Clooney and the Coen Brothers team up once again
Clooney does Coens and 
disappoints with a drag

Lengthy and uneventful, ‘Suburbicon’ fails to be anything special

Directed by George Clooney 

(“The Monuments Men”) and 
written by the Coen brothers 
(“Hail, Caesar!”), “Suburbicon” 
teases as a dark crime thriller that 
involves irrevocable actions and 
inevitable consequences, set in a 
1950s suburban neighborhood. But 
despite its promising collection of 
Hollywood elites, “Suburbicon” 
is a messy, flat and directionless 
disappointment. The film opens 
with an introduction to the world 
of 
Suburbicon, 
a 
wholesome 

and white-washed Pleasantville 
saturated in a cheesy 1950s 
aesthetic. Tensions ensue when 
a Black family moves in, and the 
community is outraged by the 
breach of their WASP oasis. Flash 
to a crowd of white men foaming 
at the mouth at a town meeting, 
demanding 
the 
neighborhood 

upholds their right to maintain 
segregation. Right off the bat, the 
movie dives into racial tensions 
of the ’50s, white flight and 
the socioeconomic politics of 
integration.

Just as quickly as they appear, 

racial dynamics take a back seat 
as the film spotlights the Lodge 
family, led by Matt Damon (“The 
Great Wall”) as the white-collar 
patriarch Gardner in perhaps 
his worst role to date. The family 
also includes Julianne Moore 
(“Kingsman: The Golden Circle”) 
in a dual role, playing both 
Gardner’s paraplegic wife Rose 
and her twin sister Margaret. 
Here we see another example of 
the hot trend of actors playing off 
themselves, done compellingly by 
Ewan McGregor in “Fargo” and 

James Franco in “The Deuce.” 
Moore is an incredible actor who 
would have certainly been dynamic 
if able to really explore this dual 
role, but unfortunately, the movie 
immediately takes a drastic turn 
that negates this opportunity. 

The crime narrative evolves 

in the film’s crucial scene, which 
happens abruptly and jarringly, 
and is messy in its immediacy. 
The rest of the film is just as 
chaotic and confusing. As a crime 
movie, the progression of the plot 
would have been interesting had 
it been eerie and psychological. 
Instead, Moore’s turn as Margaret 

comes 
off 
as 
superficially 

schizophrenic, 
or 
psychotic 

without the character depth the 
role demands. Damon is worse, 
playing the calculated patriarch 
as stiff and devoid of complexity. 
There is zero chemistry between 
him and Moore that makes their 
motivations wholly unbelievable. 
Maddeningly, Nicky understands 
the gravity of the film’s central 
conflict, but doesn’t do much about 
it; the film is riddled with plot 
holes that all involve Nicky being 
critically aware of his situation but 
somehow unable to voice his truth 
to anyone except the people that 
threaten him.

“Suburbicon” does have a splash 

of the Coen brothers charm that 
flickers to create a shadow of 

satire. A few scenes and lines of 
dialogue are kind of funny, smart 
and subversive, though fleeting. 
Near its end, the film gets so 
violent and bloody that is seems 
like a satirical crime thriller in the 
vein of Tarantino, though it never 
quite gets there. Oscar Isaac (“The 
Promise”) is fabulous as a cunning 
and slick insurance claim agent 
hot on the scent. Aesthetically, 
the film is strong, with some 
creative shots that make the movie 
visually interesting. The score by 
Alexandre Desplat (“Valerian and 
the City of a Thousand Planets”) is 
also exciting and effective.

The film’s weaknesses, though, 

by far outweigh its strengths. 
Tonally, the movie is all over the 
place, trying to be tumultuous and 
eerie but ending up flat. The acting 
is just as one-dimensional. Because 
it has no real protagonist, the film 
just floats in an empty dead space 
that makes connecting with the 
characters impossible. Random 
moments in the movie are devoted 
to showing the neighborhood’s 
crazed harassment of the Black 
family, but this racial subplot 
is completely superfluous and 
irrelevant to the larger narrative. 
Because they get no lines, the 
family members become tokens 
rather than characters. The movie 
isn’t really about racial dynamics, 
so the inclusion of this subplot 
is extremely problematic and 
superficial.

After two endless hours, it’s hard 

to figure out what “Suburbicon” 
is actually about. Is it a social 
commentary on white flight and 
WASP racism? Is it a subversive 
satire of mob thrillers? Is it a 
cinematic success for Clooney and 
the Coen brothers? None of the 
above.

DAILY FILM COLUMN

Everybody knew, 
everybody knows

Why does human decency only extend so far in Hollywood?

Earlier 
this 
week, 
Kevin 

Spacey joined the growing list 
of 
“everybody 
knew” 
sexual 

abusers after Anthony Rapp came 
forward, detailing how the actor 
came on to him when he was only 
14-years-old. In a particularly 
disgusting turn of events, Spacey 
spun the news into a coming out 
announcement.

Like Weinstein earlier this 

month, Spacey’s digressions seem 
to have been expertly covered up 
by a complicit support system. 
People have dug up Family Guy 
jokes that hint as Spacey’s sexual 
misconduct, and Rosie O’Donnell 
tweeted at him: “we all knew 
about u.”

I was surprised, and a little 

emboldened, by the swift and 
thorough takedown of Kevin 
Spacey. Hours after allegations 
surfaced, his Netflix show “House 
of Cards” was canceled. The 
LGBTQ community attacked his 
conflation of homosexuality and 
pedophilia. The TV Academy 
withdrew 
his 
International 

Emmy Founders Award.

For an industry built of the 

bodies of women and children, 
Hollywood has proved itself to 
be a somewhat sentient beast 
in the last month. Spacey and 
Weinstein’s luciferian falls from 
grace might signal a sea change 
in the way the industry deals 
with one of it’s most rampant and 
complicated problems.

This kind of instantaneous 

and all-reaching condemnation 
is similar to that of Ben Hopkins 
of queer punk band PWR BTTM. 
After allegations surfaced, the 
band was dropped from their 
record label, their music removed 
from streaming services and 
their upcoming tour canceled. It 
was exactly the kind of reaction 

perpetrators of sexual violence 
deserve. It was, in the context of 
basic human decency, just and 
fair.

The reaction didn’t, however, fit 

into the mold of how the music (or 
for that matter, film) community 
deals with sexual assault. There 
was little debate, overwhelming 
support for the victims and, for 
once, some kind of justice.

But, of course, not all reactions 

are created equal. Woody Allen 
still has a new film coming out 
this month and another slated for 
next year. Johnny Depp has three 
movies coming out this year and 

at least two for next year. After 
winning the Academy Award for 
Best Actor, Casey Affleck was 
in one of the years most highly 
regarded indies, “A Ghost Story” 
and has two more films slated for 
2018.

These men are also “everybody 

knew” cases, only with them 
the “everybody” includes us. We 
know. The people who cast and 
work with them know. Their 
agents, producers, directors and 
co-stars know.

It doesn’t make sense that the 

same industry can react to these 
men in such different ways. What 
makes Weinstein or Spacey’s case 
different from Depp or Allen’s?

Kevin Spacey, of course tried to 

use his sexuality to undercut and 
distract from the allegations. His 
sexual misconduct, he seems to 
think, is only condemned because 
he’s gay. Not because he’s a gay 
man preying on underage boys.

Maybe it’s the magnitude of 

Weinstein’s crimes that forced an 
unwilling public to come to terms 
with what it long had known: 
Hollywood (and really, America) 
has a problem with sexual assault. 
It’s much easier to ignore one 
woman than it is to ignore on 
hundred. Maybe it’s the status of 
his victims, who include Angelina 
Jolie and Gwyneth Paltrow, that 
forces us to acknowledge what 
he’s done.

As a person with a body, and 

more specifically a woman who 
wants to work in a creative 
industry (don’t ask me which one, 
I don’t know yet), this all feels 
very immediate and confusing.

Men have touched my body 

who I haven’t wanted to, they’ve 
yelled and me followed me, made 
me feel afraid of them. But I’ve 
never felt trapped by them or 
indebted to them. I’ve never been 
made to feel that my silence and 
my success were one in the same.

So it’s a little (a tiny bit) 

heartening to see an industry 
that I (maybe) want to enter so 
swiftly and thoroughly the men 
that abuse their power and status 
to make less powerful people feel 
afraid and unsafe. But, I’m not 
completely convinced.

Because there will be more 

cases that emerge where we sigh 
and say “everyone knew.” And 
there are still people that we 
know about, who we let succeed 
nonetheless. Hollywood is still a 
hypocritical, self-serving piece of 
garbage. But maybe, just maybe 
it’s getting better.

Erdem knocks it out of the 
park with an H&M collab

Luxury replaces cheapness in latest line with Swedish retailer

For 
a 
notoriously 
cheap 

brand, H&M spares no expense 
to promote its high fashion 
collaborations. This year for their 
partnership with British-based 
designer 
Erdem 
Moralıoğlu, 

which releases Nov. 2, they 
hired famed filmmaker Baz 
Luhrmann (“The Get Down”) 
to direct the promotional video. 
The short film is undeniably 
odd; it depicts a love triangle 
set in a mysterious country 
estate in shambles and includes 
dialogue so cringeworthy it 
makes you shudder with second 
hand-embarrassment. However, 
despite its adherence to weird 
tropes, the film is rhetorically 
effective: it makes you want 
to buy the clothes. The short 
is optically spectacular, every 
shot saturated with multi-hued 
flowers and attractive people 
dressed to the nines.

The 
collection 
itself 
is 

impeccably done; the clothes 

have 
a 
luxurious 
intensity 

to them, coupled with a fine 
attention to detail. There is a 
dichotomy among the pieces: 
half are defined by their crisp 
tailored lines, while the other 
half posses a more relaxed, 
flowey silhouette. All of the 
looks, however, are united by 
their sense of romanticism. 
While weird, the Luhrmann 
film does the collection justice, 
because — thanks to its modern 
take on Victorian style (lace, 
high collars, long sleeves) — if 
you were to find yourself in an 
old manor filled with flowers, 
looked after by an eccentric, 
Miss 
Havisham-esque 
lady, 

this collection is precisely the 
thing to wear. Of the collection, 
a few looks are outstanding, 
particularly the double-breasted 
gray wool womenswear suit and 
its floral brocade twin, as well as 
a silk pajama set, intended to be 
worn by both genders.

But the question still remains: 

will this collaboration be as 
lucrative 
for 
the 
Swedish 

retail giant as the ones of 

the 
past? 
Unlike 
Balmain, 

Alexander Wang or Versace, 
who 
all 
previously 
debuted 

collections with H&M, Erdem 
does not carry worldwide name 
recognition. Additionally, most 
of the pieces are priced at a 
point — about $200-299 — that 
a typical H&M shopper might 
balk at, a conscious decision on 
part of the designer. 

“I wanted to create something 

that was the opposite of fast 
fashion; I love the idea of 
creating pieces people would 
have forever,” he said in an 
interview with Fashionista.com. 
“Classic pieces that feel relevant 
in 10 years, 20 years.”

Which is precisely what he 

did. This collaboration excels 
because it is more than just junky, 
cheap clothes smeared with the 
brand name. Yet despite the lack 
of ostentatious logos, anyone 
familiar with the designer will 
instantly know you’re wearing 
one of his pieces. This collection 
is indistinguishable from his 
main line, yet is about one-tenth 
of the cost.

THE MICHIGAN DAILY | NOVEMBER 1, 2017

ILLUSTRATION BY EMILY KOFFSKY


T

his 
September, 
The Michigan 
Daily held its 
Bicentennial 

reunion 
weekend. 
Daily 

alumni 
from 
across 
the 

country 
were 
invited 
to 

return 
to 
our 
beloved 

newsroom and, among other 
things, mingle. As many of 
you know, “mingle” translates 
into “network” in hyper-
competitive college speak. As 
one of my fellow managing 
editors so elegantly put it to 
me, fidgeting in her heels and 
with an air of resignation, 
“Come to happy hour if you 
want a job.”

And that I did. I went, drank 

a little wine to make myself 
more pleasant and talked. 
And after conversation after 
conversation with Pulitzer 
winner after Pulitzer winner, 
something 
became 
very 

clear to me: I was making a 
mistake.

According to everyone I 

met that night — extremely 
successful leaders in their 
fields, mind you — dedicating 
myself to copy editing was 
a waste of time. The job 
I’ve spent three nights a 
week at for months was not 
going to exist in a few years; 
copy editing, they informed 
me, was quickly becoming 
obsolete.

Another notable quote from 

the evening: “Oh, don’t go 
into copy. Can’t your design 

editor show you InDesign or 
something?”

I like my job. It’s demanding 

but rewarding, and I get paid 
to be nitpicky — something 
people, mostly ex-boyfriends, 
consider one of my greatest 
faults. I delete commas and 
I fact-check. I get to blithely 
inform writers that “people 

affected by the aftermath 
of 
the 
hurricane” 
could 

and should be shortened to 
“Hurricane María victims.” 
I like it, and I’m qualified for 
it. In considering post-grad 
options, a looming concern 
in my final year of college, I 
naturally gravitated toward 
copy editing. I thought it’d 
be a safe bet for an English/
Spanish major who didn’t 
want to teach. It was, to put it 
lightly, a rude awakening.

I had been paying attention 

to the goings-on in my 
prospective field, of course, 
but not really; when I saw 
that The New York Times 
was doing away with their 
copy desk entirely I was sad 
(and I pulled my subscription, 
half out of support for those 
striking and half out of 
spite) but I considered it 

an isolated incident. What 
I hadn’t realized until that 
night, a few months before 
my graduation, was that 
newspapers 
across 
the 

country are downsizingtheir 
desks significantly.

This gem I found after 

falling 
down 
a 
massive 

research rabbit hole for this 
piece sums it up nicely. And 
people are noticing; “no other 
job classification has suffered 
so many losses as the news 
business downsizes,” CNN 

reported, and it’s the reason 
you’ve been seeing so many 
typos in online articles as of 
late. And while The Times’s 
corrections 
of 
misprinted 

facts may sometimes be funny, 
this 
mass 
disappearance 

of editors is representative 
of a much larger cultural 
phenomenon and one that 

has 

become especially prevalent 
since the 2016 election.

Facts just aren’t priority 

anymore. This 
is not 
a 

revolutionary 
statement; 

Donald 
Trump’s 
shaky 

relationship 
with 

documented 
occurrences 

has 
been 
well-reported. 

Post-truth 
was 
Oxford 

Dictionary’s 2016 word of the 
year. Alternative facts were 
not a one-time press gaffe 
but instead have become a 
cultural phenomenon. And 

not to perpetuate the whole 
“fake news” nonsense, but 
this shift manifests itself in 
the media as the sacrifice of 
copy editors, the ones whose 
job it is to make sure the 
facts are true and correctly 
represented.

With 
the 
omnipresence 

of 
the 
internet 
and 
its 

instantaneous 
refreshing, 

breaking a story before a 
competitor has become more 
important than ensuring its 
quality. Modern American 
media 
and 
culture 
have 

regressed to a place where 
fact-checking 
just 
isn’t 

important anymore, and it’s 
telling.

As for me, I’ll be fine. 

I’m currently working on 
“diversifying,” which you all 
know is hyper-competitive 
college speak for “starting at 
square one,” but I have some 
ideas. Maybe I’ll finally learn 
how to use InDesign. What 
keeps me up at night isn’t 
my 
personal 
professional 

instabilities but the larger 
existential 
questions 
they 

bring up: Do veracity and 
accuracy hold any cultural 
weight anymore? Can I fit 
in a society that blatantly 
disregards 
all 
I’ve 
been 

conditioned to care about? 
How do we determine truth 
if there is little punishment 
for a lie? How do we make 
sense of nonsensical daily 
occurrences? How did we get 
here? Do we care?

Soundtracking: Midterms

M

idterms. The first sign that your 
semester is heading down the toilet 
real quick. It’s like if you were going 

down a slide but as you start your descent, you 
smack your head on the bar and just tumble 
down the slide, lying in a wood chip pile of lost 
GPA points and self-pity. Every time you say 
you’re going to duck, but every time you are sadly 
mistaken.

This semester, I was optimistic. I was hopeful. 

Like a third grader stepping up to bat at their first 
little league game, picturing that ball sailing over 
the fences as the crowd cheers their victory lap, I 
thought success was bound to come my way. Good 
thing many strikeouts were in my future to bring 
me back down to Earth.

I don’t know why, but in the first month of the 

semester, I kept saying I wanted the work to hit 
me already. I was uncomfortable with how little 
the workload was stressing me out. I wanted the 
semester to bodyslam me into submission like it 
inevitably always does. I can’t explain why this 
was the case but suffice it to say, I regret every 
sentence now.

It’s 11:47 p.m. the night before one of my exams. 

After finishing some other assignments also due 
tomorrow, I sit staring at my laptop, prominently 
featuring a study guide file on Canvas. If you look 
into my eyes, the lights are on, but clearly nobody’s 
home. I’m more focused on the clock in the right-
hand corner of the screen. 11:48. 11:49. It takes 
every moral fiber in my body to not pull up some 
Vine compilations and ignore the PDF in front 
of me for a while. By the time my inner conflict 
between studying and the remnants of long-
deceased Vine is resolved, 11:53 has rolled around. 
It’s time.

“Sometime Around Midnight” — The Airborne 

Toxic Event

Working my way through the guide, every 

concept from lecture on the study guide hits me 
with more and more force, and my confusion 
responds accordingly. The professor stressed about 
28 times each lecture how this study guide is just a 
starting point and should not be the sole extent of 
my studying efforts. Seeing as though it is now 12:32 
a.m., my eyelids are already staying closed for longer 
when I blink, and the exam is at noon tomorrow, this 
will be the extent of my work prior to the test.

As I begin to stare off into space, I come to terms 

with the fact that this is my fault and my fault 
alone. No one came into my life and forced me to 
prioritize looking at the course catalog for hours 
on end instead of getting a head start on studying. 
No one offered me life everlasting to procrastinate 
this much. The only person I can directly blame 
for this entire situation is Matt Harmon and that 
dweeb is about to get a strongly worded letter after 
this hour and a half trainwreck tomorrow.

Hours of studying roll by and suddenly it’s 4:00 

a.m. and I’m still wearing a “#1 Grandma” sweater 

and jeans. I check my beard to make sure I didn’t 
wind up spending twenty years staring at that 
study guide. I don’t want to look like Tom Hanks 
in “Castaway” at this point in my life.

As I head to my room and my head hits my 

pillow, thoughts of this exam tomorrow fade out 
of my mind. No sense in stressing during my sleep. 
I set my alarm for 9 a.m. tomorrow to get a full 
breakfast and study a little more before noon. 
Everything fades and my worries melt away.

“Forget About Life” — Alvvays
The sun washes over my covers as my eyes open. 

That’s weird that I woke up before the alarm, 
seeing as though I was up pretty late. Oh well, I’m 
not one to argue with a good thing. I check my 

phone.

11:45 a.m.
Legit end me now.
I throw my blanket off as fast as I can, manage 

to pull my pants up without tripping over myself 
and eating the floor, grab my backpack with two 
#2 pencils for the scantron and a pen for the short 
answer section, and book it out the door with the 
speed of a taxi in a movie when the passenger yells 
“get me to the airport and step on it!” If any two-
ton vehicle wants to become really good friends 
with my body right now, I would gladly accept the 
offer.

“Fast Car” — Tracy Chapman
Sweating, shoulders aching from my backpack 

straps bouncing up and down and slamming into my 
back, I basically burst into the lecture hall at 11:58 
a.m. People have been slowly trickling in, studying 
like the responsible students they are and here I am, a 
shitshow of a person who doesn’t even deserve a study 
guide.

I owe my life to whoever created Michigan time.
I grab a spot in a random row, my friends from 

the class spread out around the room, looking at 
each other and making expressions that say more 
than words. If I had to guess, I’d say most of them 
were thinking “What is this exam, and why is Matt 

sweating so much?”

For about a year and a half in high school, I walked 

around with a penny bouncing around in my shoe. My 
great-grandma always said if you find a penny heads 
up, put it in your shoe and good luck will come your 
way.

Where’s my penny now?
“Lucky Penny” — JD McPherson
I fill out the scantron’s front page with my full 

name. Mathew doesn’t fit in the first name boxes, so 
I have to drop the W. For all intents and purposes, 
Matthe Harmon is about to bomb this bad boy. I feel 
bad for Matthe right now. I bubble in the key number 
and the rest of the sheet and open the exam.

I didn’t know I was taking an exam in a foreign 

language today, but that’s rad. I know my professor 
said the study guide isn’t all that will be on the exam, 
but why did she have to be telling the truth? Some 
of these terms and questions I have never even seen 
before. Call me MF doomed.

An hour and a half passes before you can say “I love 

Reggie the Campus Corgi” and about 75 percent of 
the class takes the full time like me. In the last five 
minutes, almost everyone succumbs to peer pressure 
and rises out of their seats to turn their tests in as a 
collective. Strength in numbers, I guess.

We all look at each other, never having felt more 

united over a travesty like that before.

“Crew” — GoldLink
Flash forward to two weeks from that fateful day. 

I’m sitting in the dining hall on my phone when I get 
an email from my GSI.

Subject line: Matt Exam Issue
He had mentioned something a few days ago in 

section about how grades for the midterm aren’t out 
yet because some people mixed up their key numbers 
on the scantron so they had to recalculate some 
scores. Who in their right mind would mix up a 1 and 
a 2? How in hell could you even mess up that badly?

In the wise words of Jeff Goldblum from “Jurassic 

Park,” “Life, uhhhhhh, finds a way.”

Message: “Dear Matt, you mixed up your key 

numbers on your scantron. From the first grading 
of your multiple choice section, you got 21 out of 80 
points.”

“Why You Wanna Treat Me So Bad” — Prince
I look up from my phone, my jaw almost smacking 

into the table below. What did I ever do to deserve 
this life? Who did I wrong? Did I accidentally upset 
some witch or force beyond my control that decided 
to make it their life duty to make sure Matt screws 
up in every possible way? It must have been Matthe 
that filled the scantron out wrong. Matt or Matthew 
would never do that but Matthe probably wants to see 
me fail.

I keep reading. “We assumed this was a mix-up and 

regraded your midterm. This will not happen again if 
you mess up your scantron on the final. BTW, you did 
well on your midterm.”

“Sweet” — Brockhampton.
Matthe, you done good, kid.

Gender and the Gym

coping with masculine stereotypes in fitness

b y S a m R o s e n b e r g , Daily Arts Writer

“

You need to be more aggressive.”

I nodded quietly at my baseball 

coach and walked back to home 
plate, where I attempted to muster 
up all the energy in my lithe, eight-

year-old body to hit the ball. My helmet felt too 
big on my head. My milk-white pants felt too 
tight on my legs. I already had two strikes, and 
I knew that I was a swing and a miss away from 
my third. It didn’t even matter at that point. I 
wasn’t “aggressive” enough to play baseball, 
and I couldn’t pretend to be.

From an early age, most boys are expected 

to embody ideals of masculinity — strength 
and competitive attitudes — often in physical 
activities, like sports. Unfortunately, sports 
never really stuck with me.

During soccer tournaments, I would try to 

entertain myself with an inner monologue. 
I’d even sit on the field when I sensed the ball 
wasn’t going to be kicked in my direction. Bas-
ketball was fun at times, but my short stature 
made it difficult to compete against my much 

taller, faster and more athletic teammates. I 
played tennis for several years, but I never felt 
skilled enough to commit to it. Of every sport 
I played, baseball was the most excruciatingly 
tedious. I would often either be sitting in the 
dugouts or standing in the outfield, both of 
which were paradoxically the best and loneli-
est parts of my Minor League career.

It wasn’t until the end of eighth grade that 

I found a sport more suitable to my interests: 
cross-country running. I would spend each 
fall semester of high school running with my 
teammates in the dry San Fernando Valley 
heat, sweating and heaving until my calves 
grew sore. I felt incredible knowing that I was 
getting stronger and faster with every meet 
and practice, beating my personal records and 
starting to feel like “a man.”

As co-captain of my team during my senior 

year, I was thrust into a position of leadership 
that encouraged the macho, aggressive men-
tality I eschewed when I was younger. I need-
ed to use a “manly,” aggressive voice to prove I 

could be a strong leader for my team.

Before becoming captain, I never expected 

to be the best runner or athlete or version of a 
man, because maybe I was never meant to be. 
I ran because I liked it, because it was good 
exercise and because it was easy. But perhaps I 
also ran because I felt the need to show myself 
and others that I was capable of expressing my 
masculinity in the most socially acceptable 
way possible: through sports.

For someone who doesn’t fully fit the domi-

nant mold of masculinity, sports can be alien-
ating. As I’ve grown older, I’ve found this 
alienation doesn’t escape the college campus 
either.

*****
The Intramural Sports Building and the 

Central Campus Recreation Building are the 
largest gyms on campus, and they’re free and 
accessible to undergraduate and graduate stu-
dents. Given the academic rigor and heavy 
workload of the college atmosphere, exercising 
at the gym makes for a great stress relief. It also 

helps that gyms have been statistically found to 
increase GPAs for college students.

U.S. fitness centers reached a total mem-

bership of 57.25 million in 2016, with roughly 
36,000 membership-based exercise facilities 
nationwide. Clearly, gyms are an important 
part of American and college life, and as such, 
they often reflect the same gender-based 
norms that dictate men lift weights and women 
run on the treadmill. Only 21 percent of women 
participate in strength training, according to a 
2017 study from the National Center for Health 
Statistics.

Many female students at the University of 

Michigan find the gym to be a rather intimidat-
ing place — especially the weight room.

“As a girl, I know most people don’t expect 

me to do anything other than cardio,” LSA 
junior Ali Rosenblatt, said.

Since Rosenblatt’s freshman year of high 

school, she has been consistently doing a mix 
of cardio and weight training. While she has 
become used to working out in the weight 
room, Rosenblatt still senses a stigma against 
women lifting weights at the gym, since 
weights are generally associated with “manli-
ness.”

“There’s usually a look of, ‘What’s she gonna 

pick up?’ ‘Does she actually know what she’s 
doing?’ ” she said. “People kind of look for you 
to mess up. I have a lot of friends who don’t 
want to go, whereas I see boys who clearly do 
not know what they’re doing, but they’re com-
fortable because it’s a ‘boys’ room.’ ”

LSA junior Phoebe Hopp echoes Rosen-

blatt’s sentiment.

“You never really feel like you’re just work-

ing out for yourself,” Hopp said. “Every time 
you do work out, it feels like there’s an audi-
ence.”

At non-campus gyms, Hopp says she has 

been interrupted by guys trying to instruct her 
on how to use the equipment and sometimes 
even use that opportunity to ask for her num-
ber.

“It makes your workout feel like it’s some-

how inferior to the other guys that have been 
working out,” Hopp said.

Building self-confidence can be tricky when 

appearance — looking physically strong — is at 
the forefront of gym culture. Even for people 
who have been working out since they were 
young, like Data Science junior Isha Kathuria 
trying to perfect one’s body can be an emotion-
al burden. Since she got her first gym member-
ship at age 13, Kathuria has grown accustomed 
to the gym atmosphere.

“A lot of times, there weren’t very many 

people at the gym I went to, so I was able to 

become very comfortable with myself being 
there,” Kathuria said. “When I went to bigger 
gyms, I was already comfortable with myself. I 
don’t really pay attention to what other people 
are doing and just focus on my own workout.”

But it’s easy to become self-conscious of 

one’s body image given the influence of social 
media, where Instagram fitness models gain 
popularity for posting pictures and videos 
of their exhaustive workouts and toned phy-
siques. Kathuria subscribes to fitness users 
like Whitney Simmons and Linn Lowes, both 
of whom have accumulated about one million 
Instagram followers.

“When I haven’t worked out in a while and 

feel down on myself, I avoid going on Insta-
gram Discover so I don’t have to see the videos,” 
Kathuria said. “You have your own body and 
you have your own goals, but they shouldn’t be 
based on what other people look like.”

While watching these videos can negatively 

impact one’s self-esteem — Instagram, in par-
ticular, is a known detriment to mental health 
— Kathuria says fitness models can sometimes 
be helpful when explaining the strenuous 
nature of their process.

For someone like Janae Marie Kroc, a well-

known bodybuilder from the Ann Arbor area 
who identifies as transgender and genderfluid, 
the idea of conforming to the societal standard 
of masculinity has never been easy.

“As a muscular male, (working out) is largely 

seen as a positive thing,” Kroc said. “People 
respect it. When you’re dating, it’s a plus.”

Originally from a small town in northern 

Michigan, Kroc has maintained a passion for 
exercise since childhood. By age 12, Kroc was 
working out consistently. She entered body-
building competitions during her high school 
years and continued lifting during her time 
in the Marine Corps. Currently, she trains 
five days a week, doing cardio every morning 
and following a bodybuilding diet of oatmeal, 
chicken and rice.

“It’s always about trying to be better than 

yesterday,” Kroc said.

But since beginning estrogen therapy, Kroc 

has noticed a few changes in the way people at 
the gym perceive her.

“As a woman, it’s completely different. 

Immediately, it draws a lot of stares and nega-
tivity. People question your sexuality. Especial-
ly being transgender, you get pushback from 
your own community.”

Though she now mostly trains at home, Kroc 

has added “post-estrogen PRs” to help broaden 
her workout goals to gain as much strength as 
possible during her transition.

“It’s still about progress, it’s still about mov-

ing forward. But now, it’s basically a different 
set of rules and a different framework,” Kroc 
said.

Despite the obstacles Janae faced in the 

midst of her transition, she found solace in the 
other women in the bodybuilding community.

“They struggle with all the same things 

when their femininity is questioned in the pur-
suit of muscularity and strength,” Kroc said.

*****
The weight room may not be as welcoming 

as it should be, but working out there isn’t the 
only way to stay in shape. In addition to her 
ventures to the CCRB, Rosenblatt partakes in 

weekly yoga classes at the Center for Yoga on 
the corner of East William and State Streets, 
where she says some of her male friends also 
practice.

“There’s a stigma against yoga as a more 

feminine workout,” Rosenblatt said. “But my 
(male) friends who go to yoga classes know it’s 
a tough workout.”

Along with yoga, CrossFit provides a more 

inclusive alternative to the classic weight 
room. Mika LaVaque-Manty, a political science 
professor and the director of the LSA Honors 
Program, has been going to Joust Strength and 
Fitness for nine years, a CrossFit gym in Ann 
Arbor founded by three women. Though Cross-
Fit is notable for its intense, grueling weightlift-
ing, plyometrics, gymnastics and powerlifting 
exercises, it has taken steps toward narrowing 
the gender gap by applying a more group-cen-
tric approach, in which men and women are 
given the same amount of attention and agency 
in reaching their workout goals.

“You’re suffering together, supporting one 

another, having fun together, and not compet-
ing against anyone else,” LaVaque-Manty said. 
“In so many sports, the things that we associate 
with masculinity and often with athletic excel-
lence like strength aren’t the things that make 
somebody be better athletes.”

He pointed out that CrossFit gyms generally 

don’t have mirrors. With greater gender and 
age variance, CrossFit gyms have provided a 
conscientious approach to fitness in regards to 
challenging and shifting preconceived notions 
of gender, body image and masculinity.

*****
But the question still remains: How do we 

enforce more inclusivity at gyms here on cam-
pus, and what exactly would that look like?

Mike Widen and Lisa Shea, the director and 

associate director of University Recreational 
Sports, take that issue into account when deter-
mining how to improve activities and spaces 
offered at the CCRB and the IM Building. 
When setting policies, Shea and Widen receive 
feedback from students, faculty, alumni and 
the Rec Sports advisory committee about what 
changes need to be made to on-campus gyms.

“Students play a valuable role in the process 

because they see it from both perspectives,” 
Widen said. “They experience the spaces them-
selves, but they also understand the logistics 
of what makes a place like the gym the envi-
ronment that it is. Whatever the decisions we 
make, we want to make sure that recreational 
sports are inclusive to all students, regardless 
of gender.”

Since the IM building reopened last school 

year after renovations, the space has made sev-
eral significant changes regarding inclusivity, 
such as the addition of gender-neutral bath-
rooms and locker rooms.

“It’s about the environment and physical 

structures of making our space feel welcome,” 
Shea said.

In addition to the gender-inclusive spaces, 

Shea added that incorporating a tubular design, 
softer colors, a wider entrance space, greater 
visibility and lighter-weight strength and 
cardio equipment helped implement a more 
comfortable and inviting atmosphere at the 
IM building. The rec sports’ Group X program 
also gives students a more individualized cur-

riculum through small group training in yoga, 
mindfulness, meditation and movement.

Widen and Shea both hope to apply simi-

lar gender-inclusive improvements to the 
CCRB, which is slated for renovation in 
2021, following the completion of the North 
Campus Recreation Building’s renovation in 
fall 2018 and the restoration of the Michi-
gan Union.

While gender-neutral bathrooms and locker 

rooms are creating progress in inclusivity at the 
IM building, Kroc believes education is a key 
solution to combating hyper-masculine men-
tality at the gym, to make it a safer space for 
women and gender nonconforming people.

“Being open helps a lot,” Kroc said. “For 

me, being as big and muscular as I am, it’s 
kind of a double-edged sword. On the one 
hand, it makes it very difficult for me to 
pass. Even when people read me as a female 
bodybuilder, I’m often bigger than anybody 
they’ve seen before. My muscularity also 
offers me a small measure of protection 
because people are less likely to be aggres-
sive with me.”

Men at the gym aren’t just perpetuating a 

hyper-masculine mentality; they’re affected 
by it as well. A 2017 study on masculinity 
from the Journal of American College Health 

found that college-aged men are under sig-
nificant social pressure to conform to mas-
culine gender roles. Trying to embody these 
hyper-masculine traits has also been linked 
to mental health issues, such as depression 
and substance abuse, and less favorable atti-
tudes toward getting psychological help, 
according to a 2016 study from the American 
Psychological Association.

Usually when I go to the gym, I’ll first do 

15 minutes of running on the treadmill, fol-
lowed by exercise machines, free weights and 
pull-ups. Whether it’s at the CCRB or the IM 
Building, I am constantly aware of my skin-
ny frame in comparison to the much buffer 
men standing near me. Through the mirror, 
I can feel the weight of others’ stares on me, 
even as I attempt to focus on myself and my 
physical growth. But seeing how these men 
have perfected themselves is a hard thing to 
come for someone who doesn’t participate in 
a sport anymore.

But going to the gym shouldn’t be about 

acting the most “aggressive” or looking the 
most “masculine.” It should be about lim-
proving our physical health, appreciating 
our vulnerability, understanding our limita-
tions and, ultimately, finding our own inner 
strength.

Empath in the Wild: When I Fight Back

Trigger 
warning: 
This 
article 

mentions 
sexual 
harassment 
and 

gender-based violence.
I

’ve 
never 
been 
very 

enthusiastic about Michigan 
football, but it’s my senior 
year, and I decided the 

Saturday of the Michigan State night 
game that I would go out with my 
roommates and give tailgating one last 
go before I graduated. On Saturday 
afternoon, I was ready to go, but as 
I tied my shoes to leave, something 
inside me knew I’d end up lamenting 
later that I’d spent several hours on 
this.

I should have trusted my gut: That 

Saturday a guy groped me at The 
Pit, my roommate and I witnessed 
intimate partner violence on the street 
and we were verbally harassed by two 
men a block away from our house with 
a level of graphic detail and disregard 
for basic human rights that I have 
never personally experienced before.

My 
last 
column 
was 
about 

empathizing 
with 
people 
who 

promote violence without condoning 
their behaviors, and where empathy 
and justice butt against one another. 
I 
used 
the 
example 
of 
white 

supremacists 
and 
neo-Nazis 
who 

protested in Charlottesville, saying 
I can empathize with their emotions of, 
say, displacement, while still vehemently 
opposing their actions. I’m white, so to 
a certain extent, I identify that my call 
for all people, regardless of their race, to 
empathize with white supremacists and 
neo-Nazis may reveal a white-privilege-
induced bias. Racism is a detriment to 
everyone, but it affects people of color 
much more directly than it affects me. 
One could say it’s easier for me to make 
this call for empathy because I’m white.

Although I realize racial oppression 

is different from gender oppression, I 
outline my experiences on game day to see 
if I, myself, could empathize with people 
who act violently toward me directly, 
based on my gender as a woman.

I won’t pretend to know exactly what 

goes through the minds of individuals 
who perpetrate sexual harassment and 
gender-based violence, but I can certainly 
speculate, knowing that anyone’s actions 
are a result of their inner thoughts and 
emotions. In addition, the perspective 
I’ve gained, living for 22 years as a woman 
in the U.S. can inform my speculation: 

From being catcalled while going on 
training runs for cross country in high 
school to encountering sexism in intimate 
relationships with men, I’ve been subject 
to both milder and more extreme sexual 
harassment and misogyny. I recognize 
men aren’t always the offenders in these 
situations, but they most often have been 
in my experience.

When the guy at the Pit groped me, I 

yelled at him not to. When my roommate 
and I witnessed a girl being physically 
and verbally attacked by her boyfriend, 
we offered her help. When my roommate 
and I were verbally harassed, I yelled at 
him (with plenty of expletives).

What’s frustrating is that yelling at 

people with such aggression and anger 
is not in my character. These instances 
of gender discrimination and violence 
force me into these kinds of behaviors 
because it feels like the only thing I can 
do in response. In a perfect world, I could 
try to speak out, take to activism, and 
educate people about sexual harassment, 
sexual violence and other related topics. 
People would listen, learn and adjust 

their actions accordingly.

But activist and educational efforts 

have been going on for a long time, and 
are going on right now at the University. 
The Take Back the Night protest happens 
every year; bulletin boards in dorms and 
University halls are covered with flyers 
for events such as the Vagina Monologues.

What’s more, women’s calls for equal 

treatment are all over the mainstream 
media. Hillary Clinton is a controversial 
figure, but she brings even basics of 
feminism into a general public. Further, 
assault allegations against public figures 
such as Bill Cosby and Harvey Weinstein 
also bring issues of gender equality to 
glaring attention.

The only reason I can imagine for 

someone to ignore calls for equality is 
because they feel threatened. If they 
ignore nonviolent calls, they can continue 
to reap the benefits of their privilege as 
men (in this case, white). Maybe they’re 
scared that if they begin learning more 
about women’s experiences, the faint call 
of justice may grow louder and force them 
to renounce some of their power.

This warrants fighting back. 

When one group makes nonviolent 
calls to change and the other in 
power refuse to listen, choosing 
instead 
to 
continue 
oppressing 

those who call for change, I 
can engage in empathy but also 
violence—whether it’s in the form 
of yelling, punching a guy in the 
face, or getting my friends to yell at 
him with me. Women and LGBTQ 
activists have also been doing this 
for centuries: Take Carrie Nation, 
for example, who was part of the 
feminist temperance movement in 
the late 1800s and early 1900s. The 
movement sought to stop men from 
drinking because drinking was 
associated with increased instances 
of domestic abuse. Nation was (and, 
among some, still is) famous for 
leading all-women raids into bars 
and attacking the bar fixtures and 
stock with a hatchet.

Thankfully, 
These 
kinds 
of 

encounters are unusual for me. They 
stick out in a generally peaceful 
existence. But I know other people 
— specifically people of color and 
people who are genderqueer — 
experience 
oppression 
ranging 

in levels of violence every day, 
and can feel alienated on campus 

and in classrooms, which are spaces 
they’re supposed to feel comfortable. 
The existence of this oppression is clear 
from frequent and recent protests and 
demonstrations, especially in the case of 
race relations on campus.

When people in power deliberately and 

continuously ignore nonviolent calls for 
equality, what’s the next step? Refusing 
nonviolent calls provokes people to 
become violent, turning a dialogue into a 
fight.

Even if violence can be justified in 

fights for equality, what my fellow 
advocates for human rights must never 
forget is that the other side is made up of 
individuals with valid emotions. Ignoring 
anyone’s emotions is dehumanizing, and 
it’s easy to act violently against someone 
who is construed as being less than 
human. In this way, dehumanizing people 
serves to further violence, which I believe 
should be a last resort in any fight for 
equality, whether it’s for my own equal 
treatment or for that of others. Empathy 
and violence can coexist, but it’s certainly 
not ideal.

Personal Statement: Scio Church Road

A

rms 
pumping 
vigorously 

in an attempt to match the 
cadence of my legs, I begin 
my ascent — my flushed 

cheeks a stark contrast against the dismal 
October sky of southeast Michigan. I am 
no stranger to this momentous hill, lead-
ing up toward Scio Church Road from Pio-
neer High School, or this route, as I have 
run it over 100 times since the fall of my 
sophomore year. I have now reached the 
point where I can run that 6-mile loop 
with my eyes closed, pulled along by some 
imaginary cord keeping me tethered to 
the earth beneath my rapidly moving feet.

My mind is occupied, but not with dis-

heartening thoughts — rather the reassur-
ing rhythm of my breath leaving my chest, 
the startling beauty of sunlight filtering 
through concrete, and the remnants of 
some song working its way through my 
conscious. I focus so intently upon the 
way my stride hits the pavement, and the 
burning in my lungs, that I barely notice 
the cars whizzing by or the fatigue set-
tling into my aching legs.

For once, I am not feverishly question-

ing whether I turned the stove off before 
leaving the house.

So many people ask why I choose to run 

the same route every single day, especially 
in a city replete with verdant parks, forest 
trails and bike paths. To truly understand 
my self-imposed monotony is to grasp the 
thought patterns of an anxious mind — 
this seemingly fanatical routine did not 
spring from nothingness. Rather, it devel-
oped from the multitude of attempts I 
made to deal with my anxiety while main-
taining some semblance of normalcy. I 
tried speaking with a therapist, yet strug-
gled with being completely vulnerable in 
sharing the extent of my anxieties, so this 
only lasted a few weeks. However, deter-
mined to quiet the thoughts clouding my 
brain, I continued to run. Even today, I am 
still running.

Some of my family members have dealt 

with mental health struggles — most com-
monly, 
obsessive-compulsive 
disorder 

and generalized anxiety — throughout 
their lives. For so long, I harbored the 
quiet thought that I had simply “missed” 
the anxiety gene, choosing to completely 
negate my immobilizing panic surround-
ing cross-country races, or intense fear 
of public transportation. By ignoring my 
anxiety, and failing to acknowledge it 
for what it was, I prevented myself from 
learning how to truly handle the obses-
sive thoughts invading my headspace.

I was confronted with the full effects 

of this avoidance mindset last fall when 
a combination of anxiety and depression 

left me vulnerable and frightened in the 
face of day-to-day life — panic attacks 
were not uncommon. For someone who 
has always prided herself on self-suf-
ficiency and independence, I felt over-
whelmed and unable to fully express the 
thoughts churning inside my head. I ran, 
but I felt so heavy. I knew something was 
innately not right when I began crying 
in the midst of what should have been an 
easy 3 miles from a pressing feeling that 
my chest was folding in on itself — trying 
to wring me out from the inside.

The tears, mixed with sweat, stung my 

eyes.

However, like the 40 million adults 

throughout the United States dealing with 
generalized anxiety, I could not dwell in 
darkness forever. After taking medication 
for a number of months, coupled with an 
overwhelming determination to not let 
my life be consumed by such irrational 
thoughts, I slowly started to view life as 
something to be celebrated rather than 
feared.

During this time, I began to run this 

same route every day, finding quiet solace 
in not having to plan or actively antici-
pate new twists and turns in my path. For 

45 minutes a day, I can simply just exist, 
buoyed by adrenaline and a welcome rush 
of endorphins, rather than nervously 
anticipating whatever responsibility lies 
ahead.

My mind must work constantly to prevent 

itself from being completely consumed by fear 
and dread, and sometimes I grow too weary of 
this struggle to continually battle my thoughts. 
Every single day, I obsessively worry that 
somebody I know is going to die — potentially 
even myself — due to some dire catastrophe 
that seems incredibly implausible to any other 
normal brain except my own. The thought is 
always there, as persistent and vital as any other 
basic life function. I worry about other things 
too, like whether my friends will spontaneously 
decide to dislike me, or if I will say something 
that could be misconstrued as strange in any 
conversation.

I used to enjoy public speaking, but now my 

voice always trembles — no matter the size of 
the crowd.

Yet, despite the internal noise, I have learned 

to appreciate my brain for what it is — an amal-
gamation of infinite complexities capable of pro-
ducing beautiful, rather than dismal, thoughts. 
Because of my anxiety, I am more perceptive of 
the world around me and sensitive to emotional 

nuances that sometimes go unnoticed. Only 
after periods of darkness, when I feel a constant 
tightness in my chest and dark lens obstructing 
my vision, do the mundanities of life appear so 
much more luminous.

More so than any medication or conver-

sation with a therapist, I will always have 
running to quiet my reeling mind. From 
putting on my well-worn running shoes 
to tightening my ponytail, the consistency 
of this routine provides me with a sense 
of comfort and purpose unmatched by 
any other activity in my life. Sometimes 
I glide along with relative ease, while 
other days, I feel as if my legs are being 
anchored to the ground by some sort of 
perverse gravitational pull. But regard-
less of the physical condition of my body, 
my cherished route allows me to breathe 
fully, unburdened by anxiety, for the first 
time that day.

And as I crest the hill, for a single 

moment, no matter how fleeting it may be, 
my once chaos-filled brain is replete with 
a quiet serenity. And from there, I move 
forward into the uncertain future the 
only way I know how — putting one foot 
in from of the other, my eyes scanning the 
horizon, until I reach home.

When I was in elementary school, my parents used to take me and my sisters trick 
or treating at the University’s Museum of Natural History. My mom would dress us 
up in some last-minute costume so we could hang out with dinosaurs the Sunday 
before Halloween. So when the Natural History Museum announced it was closing 

this December and moving to the new Biological Sciences building, I knew I had 
just one last chance to experience Halloween in the Hall of Evolution. As I gazed 

upon the line of trick-or-treaters at the museum last Sunday, all those memories of 

me in costume came back.

 Families enjoy the Hall of Evolution.
