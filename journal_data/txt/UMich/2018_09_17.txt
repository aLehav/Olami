A 2015 interview with Ann 
Scanlon McGinity, Michigan 
Medicine 
chief 
nursing 
executive, is record of the 
administrator’s 
hostility 
toward unions, nurses say. 
Scanlon McGinity — a lead 
player in the University of 
Michigan Professional Nurse 
Council’s ongoing contract 
bargaining with the hospital 
system 
— 
spoke 
in 
the 
interview of her dislike for 
unions and her experience 
of locking the nurses’ union 
out of the hospital when 
they held strike during her 
time as an administrator in 

the University of Maryland 
hospital system.
In the interview, Scanlon 
McGinity makes seemingly 
disparaging remarks about 
working with nurses’ unions.
Scanlon McGinity began her 
position at Michigan Medicine 
this June, shortly before the 
expiration of the UMPNC 
contract. Now, nurses are 
questioning portions of the 
2015 interview, which she 
participated 
in 
with 
the 
Women’s History Project at 
the Texas Medical Center. 
UMPNC is currently voting 
on whether to authorize a work 

In a survey of over 1,800 local 
governments in Michigan, the 
Ford School of Public Policy’s 
spring 2018 Michigan Public 
Policy survey showed most 
prohibit medical marijuana 
and nearly half report that 
medical 
marijuana 
created 
issues in their community. 
This survey gauged where the 
state’s municipal governments 
stand on the issue of medical 
marijuana.
As 
of 
Aug. 
31, 
Ann 
Arbor, 
Ypsilanti 
and 
Sharon 
Township 
are 
the 
only 
Washtenaw 
County towns represented in 
the 8 percent of governments 
surveyed that allow medical 
marijuana 
businesses. 
The 
survey reports 75 percent of 
Michigan’s local governments 
are 
to 
prohibit 
medical 
marijuana facilities, while 16 
percent have not finalized any 
legislation. 
Of 
the 
local 
officials 
polled, 42 percent reported 
experiencing problems with 
medical marijuana use in 
their 
community 
and 
21 
percent reported witnessing 
benefits related to medical 
marijuana 
use. 
Though 
the 
majority 
of 
Michigan 
governments 
don’t 
permit 
medical marijuana facilities 
in their jurisdictions, many 
Washtenaw County residents, 
such as Ypsilanti local Michael 
Moriarty, see public health 

benefits associated with local 
dispensaries.
“I think there’s a number 
of conditions that medicinal 
marijuana is beneficial for in 
ways that maybe traditional 
pharmaceuticals 
are 
not,” 
Moriarty said. “I know, for 
example, a handful of people 
with 
migraines 
that 
it’s 
beneficial for, cancer patients 
who lose their appetites, that 
kind of thing.”
According to the Harvard 
Medical 
School’s 
Harvard 

Health 
Blog, 
about 
85 
percent of Americans support 
legalizing medical marijuana. 
LSA 
senior 
Johnny 
Cole 
said he thinks dispensaries 
should open where they can 
do the most good for the 
communities they are serving.
“I feel like if it’s been 
proven that it can help with 
certain conditions, then I 
think that dispensaries should 
be in places where people with 
those conditions are most 
common,” Cole said.

In addition to pain relief and 
other medical purposes, some 
residents, such as Moriarty, 
see the potential tax revenue 
and 
job 
creation 
medical 
marijuana businesses could 
generate. Michigan legalized 
medical marijuana in 2008, 
and 
according 
to 
Forbes 
magazine, 
the 
state 
has 
reported over $600 million 
in marijuana sales revenue 
to date. Medical marijuana 
sales are taxed at 6 percent in 
Running on a tight schedule? 
A treadmill desk could be the 
answer.
Weiyun Chen, a health and 
fitness associate professor at 
the University of Michigan 
School 
of 
Kinesiology, 
investigates 
correlations 
among 
exercise, 
sleep, 
mental health and academic 
performance, 
focusing 
on 
promoting healthy lifestyles 
for students in her Physical 
Activity & Health Laboratory.
In a recent study, Zhanjia 
Zhang, a Kinesiology graduate 
student in Chen’s lab, examined 
active 
work 
environments, 
such as the treadmill desk, and 
tracked participants’ executive 
function as they performed 
mental tasks during physical 
activity. These tasks tested 
working memory, inhibition 
— the ability to focus on a 
relevant task — and cognitive 
flexibility — the ability to 
transition 
between 
tasks.

Known for her passionate remarks at City Council meetings, Griswold will serve first term

The city of Ann Arbor saw 
three out of four incumbent City 
Council members defeated in 
the August primary elections. 
Councilmember Kirk Westphal, 
D-Ward 2, lost his primary 

race to Kathy Griswold bt 
53 
votes. 
The 
Michigan 
Daily sat down with incoming 
Councilmember 
Griswold, 
to 
discuss her platform and future 
plans.
Griswold is a former trustee 
for 
the 
Ann 
Arbor 
Public 
Schools district and will run 
now uncontested for her ward 

seat this November.
Though this will be Griswold’s 
first term as a council member, 
she has attended meetings for 
years and is known for providing 
frequent, impassioned remarks 
during public commentary in 
City Council meetings. Her main 
points have been promoting 
public safety and accelerating 

sewer and road repairs.
Furthermore, 
she 
spoke 
out against a 2014 proposal to 
expand transit services and the 
2016 proposal to increase City 
Council terms to four years.

are distinct in two ways: They are 
organizations, not individuals, and 
they are the youngest recipients of 
the award in its 26-year history.
The award was created to 
commemorate the legacy of Raoul 
Wallenberg, a U-M alum who saved 
more than 80,000 Hungarian 
Jews near the end of World War 
II. It is awarded to those who 
“demonstrate the capacity of the

Michigan.
“In 
the 
business 
sense, 
I mean it’s tax revenue,” 
Moriarty 
said. 
“Usually 
they’re small businesses 
that are locally owned. I 
don’t really see a negative 
impact 
on 
communities 
coming from them.”
However, 
legalizing 
medical 
marijuana 
facilities 
can 
cause 
controversy, 
which 
LSA junior Kyla Truax 
experienced 
in 
her 
hometown.
“I actually live in a 
town up north (Michigan), 
and they were thinking 
of putting in a plant right 
where I live,” Truax said. 
“A lot of people opposed 
it, so it ended up getting 
shut down and moved to a 
different city … I know a 
lot of people that were in 
support, thought it was a 
great idea to bring in jobs.”
The 
Public 
Policy 
School 
survey 
also 
included questions about 
recreational 
marijuana. 
Though only 21 percent 
of 
local 
government 
officials 
support 
the 
legalization of recreational 
marijuana, 61 percent of 

Michigan residents support it. 
Engineering junior Margaret 
Kohler 
understands 
the 
rationale for the legalization 
of 
recreational 
marijuana 
because she foresees people 
without 
legitimate 
medical 
marijuana cards gaining access 
to the drug anyway.
“I think you’d also expect 
an increase in fake medical 
marijuana 
cards 
so 
that 
people could get it, and it’s 
almost a better argument just 
to legalize recreational use,” 
Kohler said.
Moriarty said he supports 
the 
total 
legalization 
of 
marijuana.
“On top of medicinal, I 
would support full legalization 
of marijuana, and to that 
end, it also decreases the 
criminal element, decreases 
having to put people in prison 
over 
marijuana 
offenses,” 
Moriarty said. “I don’t really 
see a downside under any 
circumstance.”
According to the Public 
Policy 
School 
survey, 
low 
support 
of 
recreational 
marijuana legalization among 
officials is true across political 
affiliation and age.

The Michigan Marching 
Band 
gave 
an 
electoral 
themed 
performance 
Saturday 
to 
support 
the 
efforts of the Big Ten Voting 
Challenge during University 
of Michigan football game 
against Southern Methodist 
University halftime show.
The challenge seeks to 
increase voter participation 
across 
the 
14 
Big 
Ten 
universities, 
awarding 
schools with the highest and 
best improvement ineligible 
voter turnout. 
In one of its most politically 
charged presentations, the 

band 
performed 
several 
formations 
on 
the 
field 
related to U.S. history and 
politics, including the phrase 
“We the People” and the 
American flag. The band 
also used its act to highlight 
low voter turnout in the 2016 
presidential election as well 
as low voter turnout among 
college 
students 
in 
the 
primaries this year.

to 
Dr. 
Mark 
Schlissel, 
Dr. 
Martin 
A. 
Philbert, Cynthia Wilbanks, 
Kallie 
Michels, 
Edie 
Goldenberg, 
and 
Mark 
Clague for their help with 
yesterday’s halftime show! 
Also thanks to Bill and 
Janelle 
Sykes 
for 
their 
support 
of 
Saturday’s 

halftime performance. 
In the video aired on 
the big screen before the 
performance, 
University 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel 
urged students to participate 
in 
their 
opportunity 
to 
 
share 
their 
voice 
this 
November.
Following 
Schlissel’s 
video presentation, speeches 
from 
former 
Presidents 
Gerald Ford, Barack Obama, 
and Abraham Lincoln were 
presented 
on 
the 
video 
screen. At one point in the 
presentation, 
marching 
band members held up two 
large flags one opposite ends 
of the field, depicting the 
Republican party elephant 
and the Democratic party 

donkey. 
The 
band 
then 
brought 
the 
two 
flags 
together, urging attendees to 
look beyond party. 
“Election day is almost 
here,” Schlissel said. “We 
urge students to get involved 
in civilian life, get registered 
and out to vote and bring 
home the trophy for the 
Maize and Blue.”
Central 
Student 
Government 
and 
the 
Ginsberg 
Center 
for 
Community 
Service 
and 
Learning have collaborated 
to help with the online 
voter registration process. 
The 
University 
has 
also 
partnered with Turbovote to 
collect voting data and help 
students with registration.

ON THE DAILY: MARCHING BAND CALLS ATTENDEES TO VOTE 

RACHEL CUNNINGHAM
Daily Staff Reporter


Somewhere in China, a little 

girl talks to her father on the 
phone. He is in the United 
States. She tells him he is a bad 
person and that the Chinese 
police are good people. That’s 
the last he hears from her for six 
months. His wife soon divorces 
him, because being married to 
him puts a “target on her back.” 
He is left hopeless, posting 
on social media in hopes of 
finding his wife and daughter. 
Unfortunately, the reason for 
this separation is this man, 
Tahir Imin, and his family have 
been diagnosed with a deadly 
disease. It’s very contagious, 
a “virus of the mind” the 
government calls it, and it has 
infected over a billion people 
worldwide. The disease is called 
Islam.

What’s happening in China is 

rarely talked about, but it’s real 
and it’s terrifying. China has 
deemed the religion of Islam 
a “contagious disease” and an 
“ideological illness” and has 
sent about one million Uighurs 
(a 
predominately 
Muslim 

ethnic minority in northwest 
China) to internment camps to 
be brainwashed and forced to 
denounce their own thinking. 
According to The Atlantic, 
when parents are sent to these 
camps, “younger children are 
sent to de facto orphanages 
known 
as 
child 
welfare 

guidance centers and older 
children are sometimes sent to 
state-run vocational schools.” 
The conditions in these camps 
are horrible, described by a 
worker in Xinjiang — a name, 
which means “Muslim Frontier 
Land,” the Han Chinese gave 
to the Uyghur Autonomous 
Region — as a place where 
children are “locked up like 
farm animals in a shed.” The 
little girl, Imin’s daughter, has 
been trained to despise her 
religion and express loyalty to 
the Chinese Communist party. 

Families are being ripped apart 
as the Chinese government 
attempts to erase generations 
of traditions, beliefs and ideals. 
The government is so strict 
about this surveillance that 
citizens are afraid to even say 
Islam-related words on the 
phone. The party has even 
gone to the disturbing extent 
of initiating “home stays,” in 
which “officials temporarily 
move 
in 
with 
families 
in 

Xinjiang to surveil and report 
on them.” Muslims detained 
in these camps are also forced 
to eat pork and drink alcohol, 
which is against the tenants 
of their faith. Among some of 
the punishments for failure to 
denounce their religion and 
identities include starvation, 
beatings 
and 
solitary 

confinement. One can only 
imagine 
the 
psychological 

damage that ensues from this 
type of treatment.

Islam and Muslims have 

been the target of hate and 
bigotry since 9/11, but this 
bizarre phenomenon of treating 
the religion like an actual 
disease and sending Muslims 
to be quarantined is absolutely 
outrageous. Referred to as the 
“the largest mass incarceration 
of a minority population in 
the world today,” the lack of 
attention and concern for this 
issue baffles me. My heart goes 
out to all the Chinese Muslims 
who live in fear, who are being 
tortured 
and 
brainwashed, 

who are being stripped of 
their faith and their families 
and their identities. Uighurs’ 
unique religious and ethnic 
traditions are being replaced 
with 
manufactured 
Chinese 

communist pride. I pray we see a 
day when Muslims of every race 
and country can freely practice 
and be rid of the life sentence 
of scrutiny that the world has 
inflicted upon us. I pray we see a 
day when the world understands 
the real “ideological illness” is 
hatred and the inability to allow 
humans to exist as humans and 
not targets.

Don’t ask why we came.
Ask why we left.
Some say the story ends in 

liberation,

but there was no end,
only the horizon.
In the distance,
a military ship.
Men dove into the water
like fish eager for home.
But I,
who had learned to escape,
not swim,
remained onboard.
Safety was already far 

behind us.

And in front,
a soldier.
One finger on the trigger,
the rest clawing through 

my bag.

Our compass buried at the 

bottom

of a rice bowl.
Your father, a boy of 

seventeen

with a twist in his leg,
passed the time
in the nape of my neck.
No one could know us now.
I was so hungry for a new 

life

that I had swallowed the 

paper trail.

There are no heroes in this 

version,

only survivors.
I’ve always been that kind 

of person,

the kind to remember the 

way things were

yet still forget to be afraid.
Don’t feel bad, my dear.
These aren’t tears —
just the ocean left in my 

eyes.

You 
could 
never 
love 

Vietnam,

for you are a December 

child,

and to return to that 

country

is to step into summer 

forever.

But do not think you could 

come

from anywhere else.
You look like me
after all. 

I’ve 
never 
really 
cared 

about or followed the latest 
trends. Instead, I’ve always 
thought 
of 
myself 
as 
a 

trendsetter. But on Monday, I 
stumbled upon Seek Refuge, 
a clothing company that uses 
its platform and products for 
female empowerment, Muslim 
representation and refugee aid. 
They’re branded as the first to 
make streetwear for Muslim 
women 
regardless 
of 
their 

personal modesty choices.

For me, my wardrobe is an 

extension of who I am. My style 
is a reflection of my personality 
and my commitment to be 
unapologetically me.

Like my wardrobe, I don’t 

neatly fit into one box or 
category. 
I 
am 
boho-chic, 

professional and daring. I am 
Nigerian-American, 
Muslim 

and progressive.

Like my personality, my 

closet 
is 
overflowing 
with 

vibrant colors, patterns and 
fabrics. I am as bright as my 
favorite coral dress, as unique 
as my African attire and as 
strong as my leather handbags.

Like the way my outfits 

change as the seasons pass, I 
am adaptable, reliable and a 
little unpredictable.

Yet, I have always struggled 

to find a balance between 
expressing 
myself 
through 

fashion and staying true to 

my faith as a Muslim woman. 
I see Muslim women cloaked 
in beautiful robes and tightly 
pinned hijabs and yearn to 
look as beautiful as they do. 
Yet, when I pin up my hair and 
look into the mirror, I don’t 
see me. It’s taken me so long to 
feel comfortable and beautiful 
in my own skin and now I’m 
proud to show it off. I’m finally 
starting to find a balance 
and defining my own type of 
modesty. Seek Refuge gives 
Muslim women a way to define 

modesty for themselves.

The best part is a portion 

of every purchase is donated 
to refugee aid organizations 
overseas. Lately, I’ve felt pretty 
frustrated with my inability 
to aid in the growing refugee 
crisis across the globe. I feel 
guilty at times knowing I 
have two homes when about 
11 million Syrians have been 
forced to flee their homes, but 

companies like Seek Refuge 
give me a way to do something 
I probably would have done 
anyway while giving back.

I personally cannot wait 

to get my very own “Refuge 
Jacket,” their feature item. Its 
oversized fit and the Arabic 
script on the back perfectly 
embodies 
Seek 
Refuge’s 

mission. It’s quite literally a 
fashion statement. The Arabic 
script on the back, handwritten 
by a Muslim calligrapher, is 
a poem written by a Syrian 
refugee. It reads:

Once we were at least happy. 

There once was peace where 
we resided

In 
our 
land 
of 
birth; 

our 
homeland. 
We 
never 

anticipated this

That war would tear us apart 

and leave us miserable this way

We witnessed so powerlessly 

our 
brothers 
and 
sisters 

brutalized

Our homes and properties 

burnt, and then came our 
displacement

We 
have 
hopes 
but 
in 

despair. We cried peace but in 
bloodshed

That oh, we’d better seek 

refuge. We ran for our dear 
lives

Hunting for safety across the 

borders our dreams seem direly 
shattered

As we seek for a new 

homeland, in a land where no 
one wants us.

What’s

“Kuch Kuch Hota Hai,” “Dil 

Chahta Hai,” “Kabhi Khushi 
Kabhie Gham,” “Mujhse Dosti 
Karoge!”, “Kaho Naa… Pyaar 
Hai” - I grew up watching the 
sappiest romance movies ever. 
My first celebrity crush was 
a Bollywood actor and I’ve 
always cared more about the 
newest Hindi movie than the 
latest Jonas Brothers album 
(my worlds have been colliding 
a lot recently … ). When I was 
younger I’d get teased for not 
having seen “Toy Story” or 
not being able to quote “The 
Parent Trap.” While my friends 
debated the spelling of “sup
ercalifragilisticexpialidocio
us,” I was singing, “chanda 
chamke cham cham chikhe 
chaukanna chor, chiti chate 
chinee 
chatoree 
chinikhor” 

from “Fanaa.”

When I was younger, I 

watched 
Bollywood 
movies 

because that’s what my desi 
parents watched and it’s all I 
knew. As I got older, I continued 
to watch them for a multitude of 
reasons.

When I would visit my 

cousins abroad, they made fun 
of my weird American accent 
and how I couldn’t really 
communicate 
with 
anyone 

outside of our family. My 
cousins in Mumbai learned 
Hindi and English in school as 
well as our family dialect. I, on 
the other hand, grew up in the 
United States, where the only 
additional language I learned 

was English. I used to visit India 
confused about everything and 
with zero communication skills. 
So, I watched Bollywood movies 
in the hopes of learning Hindi.

I 
continued 
watching 

Bollywood movies in the hopes 
of learning about customs that 
weren’t mine. I didn’t like the 
astonished reactions I would 
get when I told people I didn’t 

know the answer to their 
question about Hindu rituals 
that they assumed were Indian 
traditions, or when my non-
Muslim desi friends mentioned 
holidays or ceremonies that my 
family didn’t participate in. I 
wanted to be part of the desi 
community around me and 
watching 
Bollywood 
movies 

was how I tried to decipher all 
the things that to an outsider I 
looked like I would know, but 
just didn’t.

Now, I watch Bollywood 

movies because these movies 
are a connection to my South 

Asian roots. I’ve spent so much 
of my life internalizing racist 
ideals and distancing myself 
from my parent’s heritage that 
Hindi movies have become 
my way of learning to love my 
culture.

As much as I love the 

Bollywood film industry and 
Hindi-language films, I can’t 
help but feel some cognitive 
dissonance every time I sit 
down to watch one. Bollywood 
movies are SO problematic. This 
is, of course, a reflection of the 
society that creates these movies 
and the audiences that consume 
them. Yet, while I recognize 
the problems in these movies, 
I haven’t been able to bring 
myself to boycott them the way 
I will Hollywood movies. How 
can I cut myself off from the one 
thing that’s keeping me rooted 
in 
my 
culture? 
Ultimately, 

I’ve decided that I can still 
appreciate a typical Bollywood 
blockbuster for its filmy drama, 
while acknowledging that some 
of the jokes, and sometimes even 
the entire plot, is extremely 
problematic.

This 
column 
will 
be 
a 

space for me to talk about my 
problematic favs. The biggest 
Bollywood movies always have 
questionable 
elements 
and 

I want to think about them 
critically while still being able 
to appreciate the reasons that I 
bother watching these movies 
in the first place. Stay tuned for 
movie reviews, rants about the 
many messed up parts of the 
Hindi film industry and some 
celebrity buzz too.

T

he White House was 
rocked 
last 
week 
following 
The 
New 
York 
Times’s 
publication 
of a critical Op-Ed from an 
anonymous senior official in 
President 
Donald 
Trump’s 
administration, 
eliciting 
a 
far-reaching 
array 
of 
reactions from all sides of 
the political spectrum. The 
Op-Ed, 
which 
praised 
the 
president’s 
conservative 
legislative achievements while 
condemning 
the 
president’s 
“anti-democratic” 
impulses 
and 
“amoral” 
disposition, 
publicly 
embarrassed 
the White House and left 
prominent 
administration 
officials scrambling to deny 
any role in the editorial’s 
authorship.
Arguably the most extreme 
reaction 
was 
from 
Steve 
Bannon, former White House 
chief 
strategist 
and 
“alt-
right” leader, who declared 
the Op-Ed a “coup” and part 
of 
a 
“broader 
conspiracy” 
against Trump, likening the 
author to George McClellan, 
the Civil War general who 
was punished for ignoring 
Abraham 
Lincoln’s 
orders. 
Bannon’s 
comments 
are 
characteristically hyperbolic 
and only loosely based in 
reality, 
but, 
ironically, 
he 
draws attention to one of the 
greatest dangers of the Trump 
presidency: the damage to our 
nation’s political system and 
institutions that could linger 
long after Trump leaves office.
Trump 
came 
to 
Washington, 
D.C., 
with 
a 
pledge to “drain the swamp,” 
but that vow has manifested 
itself as a bitter assault against 
anyone and any institution 
that resist Trump’s political 
narrative 
and 
proposed 
policies. Rather than root out 
corruption 
or 
inefficiency, 
the 
president 
has 
merely 
normalized the reckless and 
childish rhetoric that defined 
his campaign. At times it feels 
redundant, or even tiresome, 
to evaluate the president’s 
leadership and temperament, 
but 
let’s 
examine 
his 
interaction with the various 
actors and institutions in our 
political system.
Trump’s most acrimonious 
relationship is the combative 
rivalry 
he 
has 
cultivated 
with 
the 
media. 
Trump’s 
relationship 
with 
the 
mainstream media has been 
strained since his campaign 
began over three years ago. 

Trump’s penchant for lying 
led to countless news articles 
and hours of media coverage 
devoted to fact-checking his 
various tweets and speeches. 
Trump responded by deriding 
mainstream media outlets like 
The Washington Post, The 
New York Times and CNN as 
“fake news.”
One 
hoped 
Trump’s 
animosity toward the press 
would subside once he took 
office, but rather the president 
has attempted to use the office 
to legitimize his contempt of 
the media. From lying about 
the size of his inauguration 
crowd to euphemizing these 
false claims as “alternative 
facts,” to comically distorting 
his own statements at a summit 
with 
Russian 
President 
Vladimir Putin, frequent lies 
and attacks on the media have 
become a defining staple of the 

Trump White House.
The president’s assault on 
the press has worked, at least 
among his base. Over half of 
Republicans believe the press 
is the “enemy of the people” and 
43 percent say Trump should 
be allowed to shut down news 
organizations. These numbers 
are incredibly disconcerting, 
and 
symptomatic 
of 
an 
administration 
that 
has 
legitimized the notion that 
facts are subjective. When 
the facts don’t align with 
your beliefs, the appropriate 
response 
is 
to 
reevaluate 
your beliefs, not to get new 
“facts.” Unfortunately, Trump 
has normalized the baseless 
rejection of opposing evidence, 
exacerbating political divisions 
and impeding efforts to govern 
effectively. Furthermore, the 
deluge of falsehoods from the 
West Wing has degraded the 
credibility of the executive 
branch and created a mindset 
that White House statements 
are to be scrutinized rather 
than respected.
Another one of Trump’s 
favorite 
targets 
is 
the 
legal 
system. 
Trump 
has 

routinely disparaged special 
prosecutor Robert Mueller’s 
investigation 
into 
alleged 
Russian interference during 
the presidential election and 
publicly blasted judges whose 
decisions 
he 
disapproved. 
He either fails to understand 
or fails to appreciate the 
virtues of an independent 
justice 
system, 
evidenced 
by 
his 
frequent 
criticism 
of 
Attorney 
General 
Jeff 
Sessions’s decision to recuse 
himself 
from 
the 
Russia 
investigation and his firing 
of FBI Director James Comey 
— a decision Trump himself 
said was partly due to the way 
Comey handled the Russia 
investigation.
In a way, Steve Bannon 
is right — our ideal world is 
not one where the president 
is undermined by his own 
aides and allies. But our ideal 
world is also not one where the 
president starts trade wars, 
threatens to shut down news 
agencies, 
withdraws 
from 
multiple international treaties 
and muses about assassinating 
foreign rulers — often on a 
whim.
The reality is that our 
political institutions are under 
attack — not by whistleblowers 
or the Op-Ed’s author, but by 
the president. This is not to say 
that our political system cannot 
recover. 
Our 
Constitution 
is strong, the separation of 
powers 
is 
well-established 
and as The New York Times’s 
Op-Ed 
demonstrates, 
even 
many of those within the 
administration will resist the 
president’s worst ideas and 
impulses. Still, we must guard 
the health and integrity of 
our democratic institutions. A 
vibrant free press and strong, 
independent judicial system 
are both central pillars of 
democracy, 
which 
is 
why 
Trump’s incessant attacks on 
them are so irresponsible.
The 
fallout 
from 
these 
attacks threaten to remain 
long after he leaves office. 
Bad policies can be reversed, 
but it is far harder to repair 
a political system that has 
been 
continuously 
attacked 
by the most powerful man 
in 
the 
country. 
Likewise, 
the true threat of the Trump 
presidency lies not in his 
legislative agenda, but in his 
shameless disparagement of 
our democratic institutions.

New hemisphere, new perspective
A

t the 5,000-foot summit 
of a mountain in Wanaka, 
New Zealand, I cried. I 
was sitting on the ground eating a 
peanut butter and jelly sandwich 
after having trekked up the nearly 
four miles of straight incline trail. 
There was salt on my face from the 
sweat, chilling against my skin in 
the breeze. As I looked out on the 
water and mountains surrounding 
me, I felt a sense of calm I had never 
known — so much so that I was 
overwhelmed and, before I knew 
it, I was actually, embarrassingly, 
crying.
Next to the sleepy town of 
Wanaka on the South Island of 
New Zealand lies Roy’s Peak, which 
offers a full-day zigzagging hike 
up the side of Mount Roy through 
grass and packed gravel, littered 
with sheep and the presents they 
leave behind. It was a difficult hike 
for a novice like me, especially 
considering I was ill-equipped with 
a pair of worn-in running sneakers 
 
and the same Jansport backpack 
that I use to carry my books to class. 
Once I reached the summit, I was 
forced to forget the pain in my legs 
and reckon with the panoramic, 
seemingly endless views across and 
beyond Lake Wanaka.
There are some places and 
moments that defy description. It’s 
cliché, trite and frankly groan-
inducing of me to say, but this was 
one of those moments. Not in terms 
of physical description — I could 
wax poetic about the rolling hills 
and cascading mountains, about the 
bluest blue of the water, about the 
eerie and comforting sound of only 
the wind and the footsteps of fellow 
hikers — but in terms of the feelings 
it inspired.

I traveled to New Zealand for 
10 days during my semester abroad 
in Sydney, Australia. The decision 
to study in Sydney was spurred 
by a desire to go to Australia for 
as long as I could remember. It’s 
where I was born and my family 
lived for five years in the mid-’90s 
before returning home to Boston. I 
spent four months in the Southern 
Hemisphere, kicked off with a trip 
to Southeast Asia and bookended 
by nearly two whole days sitting 
on a plane. To say I experienced 
more natural beauty abroad than I 
had seen in the last 21 years of my 
life would be a given. To say I saw 
the smallest and rarest dolphins 
in the world, had what is likely an 
increasingly rare chance to see the 
Great Barrier Reef and tasted the 
Australian delicacy that is a Tim 
Tam would be bragging. To say I 
experienced a change within me 
that can only come with travel 
would be more accurate, albeit 
nauseatingly cheesy.
On the other side of the world, 
in a place that I barely knew, I felt 
surer of myself than ever before. 
I felt more grounded and less 
anxious. I felt less worried about 
how I was being perceived and more 
concerned about the next item on 
my bucket list. I’m almost positive I 
blinked less, keeping my eyes open 
wide as much as possible to soak up 
everything around me. I watched 
more, I noticed more, I learned 
more.
A trip like this is few and far 
between. One where you focus 
on what is directly in front of you 
rather than the noise inside your 
head. One where you wake up and 
go to sleep when the sun does, rather 
than when your phone alarm tells 

you. One where you are overcome 
with emotion — on more than one 
occasion — from contemplating 
just how much bigger and more 
important the world is than you.
If you are young, have the 
physical ability and the financial 
means and are eager to be better, 
you should travel — as frequently 
and as widely as possible. Hop in a 
car, on a plane, on a bus. Plan, but not 
too much. Eat whatever you think 
you can stomach, even if it’s a bird 
embryo in Vietnam. Talk to people. 
Learn. Be open.
The more places I see and 
experience, the smaller I feel. The 
world is impossibly vast, and the 
more I explore it, the more I realize 
how little I know, how many places 
I have yet to go, how much more I 
have to learn. Traveling makes you 
feel insignificant in the good kind of 
way.
This 
specific, 
humbling 
insignificance, I have decided, is 
my favorite kind of feeling. I want 
to pocket it for times when I feel too 
self-assured, too smug, too caught 
up in my own minute troubles. I 
want to feel tiny and unwise and 
know I have places to go that will 
bring me, in the most literal sense, 
back down to earth. I want to hold 
on to this feeling for the rest of my 
life. When I set off for my return 
down Roy’s Peak — with a quiet 
brain, tired legs and a huge smile on 
my face — I set off in pursuit of that 
insignificance.

Institutions under attack

This case involved a male 
student, referred to as John 
Doe, and a female student, 
named Jane Roe, who were 
attending a fraternity party. 
Doe 
allegedly 
sexually 
assaulted Roe after serving 
her alcohol, and Roe went 
to the hospital to have a 
rape kit administered later 
that evening. No criminal 
charges were made against 
Doe; however, the University 
decided he was guilty of 
sexual misconduct, and he 
left 
school 
before 
being 
expelled. Doe then sued the 
University on the grounds 
that he was denied his right 
to a cross-examination of his 
accuser, and the circuit court 
eventually ruled in favor of 
Doe. In light of this ruling, 
we as the Editboard at The 
Michigan 
Daily 
encourage 
the 
University 
to 
stay 
committed to supporting and 
protecting all survivors of 
sexual assault.
The ruling declares those 
accused of sexual misconduct 
must be given the option to 
cross-examine their accuser. 
Researchers have shown that 
live cross-examination does 
little to find truth in legal 
proceedings, but rather it gives 
the defense an opportunity to 
intimidate and manipulate the 
victim. Cross-examination is, 
at its essence, combative and 
aggressive; 
Thapar 
himself 
characterizes 
the 
practice 
as 
“the 
back-and-forth 
of 
adversarial questioning” in 
the ruling. 
In 
cases 
of 
sexual 
misconduct, this process of 
adversarial 
questioning 
is 
gratuitously 
traumatizing 
for the accuser, as it requires 
them to face their alleged 
abuser and recall distressing 
events. Due to this effect, 
the ruling may discourage 
victims from coming forward 
to the University about the 
assault or misconduct they 
have experienced, in fear that 

they will be forced to relive it 
through 
cross-examination. 
Furthermore, 
it 
may 
also 
discourage 
witnesses 
from 
testifying 
on 
behalf 
of 
accusers, as they are also 
subject to cross-examination. 
There is reason for having 
separate 
University 
and 
legal proceedings in sexual 
assault cases, so as to provide 
the 
survivor 
with 
greater 
agency in handling the case. 
This ruling narrows the gap 
between these two kinds of 
proceedings, thus removing 
a substantial part of that 

agency.
This 
ruling 
also 
has 
implications beyond cross-
examination; 
it 
has 
been 
framed 
as 
a 
victory 
for 
the 
accused 
in 
cases 
of 
sexual assault, and also as a 
victory on behalf of men in 
general. In the ruling, the 
judge writes the University 
has “discredited all males, 
including Doe, and credited 
all females, including Roe, 
because 
of 
gender 
bias,” 
suggesting 
in 
the 
effort 
to 
support 
survivors, 
the 
University has in fact been 
discriminatory 
against 
all 
men. This rhetoric conflates 
“males” with “accused,” and 
“females” with “accusers,” 
which reinforces the idea 
that men cannot be victims to 
sexual assault. Furthermore, 
it paints an image of accusers 
as 
conniving 
or 
wrongly 
motivated in coming forward. 
Framing sexual assault in 

this way is dangerous and 
harmful to survivors of all 
genders.
The University has yet 
to 
announce 
if 
they 
will 
appeal this ruling to the 
Supreme 
Court. 
We 
hope 
regardless of their decision, 
they will stand ardently on 
the side of survivors and not 
succumb 
to 
rhetoric 
that 
seeks 
to 
intimidate 
them. 
Assuring that sexual assault 
proceedings are done in a 
manner that makes the victim 
as comfortable as possible 
is essential to this goal, as 
we want survivors to feel 
empowered to come forward, 
rather than discouraged by 
fear of intimidation. Moreover, 
we encourage the University 
to 
continue 
creating 
a 
process 
that 
encourages 
healing for survivors rather 
than 
disturbing 
traumatic 
memories.
In summary, we as an 
Editboard 
do 
not 
believe 
cross-examination 
will 
add anything beneficial to 
sexual assault cases at the 
University; moreover, it will 
unnecessarily upset survivors. 
The rhetoric surrounding the 
case has also been harmful and 
counterproductive. For these 
reasons, we do not support the 
circuit court’s ruling. Despite 
the University’s decision in 
this particular case, we hope 
they will continue to protect 
their students by supporting 
survivors in all future legal 
proceedings.

FROM THE DAILY

The problems with cross-examination
L

ast Friday, September 7th, the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 
on a controversial sexual assault case against the University of 
Michigan. Judge Amul Thapar wrote the decision, ruling that 
“if a public university has to choose between competing narratives to 
resolve a case, the university must give the accused student or his agent 
an opportunity to cross-examine the accuser and adverse witnesses in 
the presence of a neutral fact-finder.”

Cross-
examination is, 
at its essence, 
combative and 
aggressive

ANSWER TO PREVIOUS PUZZLE:

Release Date: Monday, September 17, 2018

There’s something utterly 

charming 
about 
comedian 

Hasan Minhaj. He has big 
eyes that bug out whenever 
he delivers a joke and he’s not 
afraid to be self-deprecating at 
any chance he gets. 

Last 
weekend, 
comedian 

Minhaj visited the Michigan 
Theater with his “Before the 
Storm” standup show. The show 
is meant to be a preview for his 
upcoming show on Netflix, 
“Patriot 
Act 
with 
Hasan 

Minhaj,” which will debut in 
Oct. 28, 2018.

Ann Arbor didn’t disappoint 

in its enthusiasm, delivering 
two sold-out shows. Hundreds 
of people flocked outside the 
Michigan Theater’s entrance, 
and their nervous energy was 
infectious. I felt like I was 
waiting outside of the movie 
theater to watch a Bollywood 
movie premiere in the U.S. after 
it became a huge hit in India. 

Minhaj immediately thanked 

us for agreeing to lock up our 
phones with Yondr so that we 
wouldn’t leak any spoilers for 
“Patriot Act.” At the beginning 
of his tour, he had asked the 
audience 
to 
refrain 
from 

taking and posting videos, but 
inevitably, he would look down 
at the front row and see lots of 
“old uncles” with their phones 
up, taking a video even as he 
asked them not to. 

With the quick wit that 

brought 
Minhaj 
to 
“The 

Daily 
Show” 
as 
a 
senior 

correspondent, he launched into 
the heart of his show, discussing 
politics in an entertaining but 
serious way. Minhaj is a master 
of using our emotions to build 
up our laughter and energy so 
that when he tells us something 
somber, we feel it hard. Using 
video 
clips, 
graphics 
and 

some funny pictures, Minhaj 
commented on the country’s 
political and cultural landscape, 
from the fear of terrorism to 
media portrayals of people from 
different ethnic backgrounds.

For the same reason we 

had to lock up our phones, I’m 
not going to spoil too many of 
Minhaj’s bits about politics. 
What I will say is that if you’re 
looking to figure out the cost 
of terrorism insurance, then 
Minhaj is your guy. 

My favorite part of the show 

was 
the 
conclusion, 
when 

Minhaj stepped aside from 
politics and delved into his 
personal life with the story of 
how he proposed to his wife. 
Upon deciding it was time to 
finally make the commitment, 
Minhaj set out to buy an 
engagement ring, and saw his 
bank account hit $0 for the first 
time in his life.

Then, Minhaj realized he 

still needed money for the 
actual proposal part.

He turned to the ultimate 

source of good deals — Groupon 
— to book a sunrise hot air 
balloon ride on a Wednesday 
morning. After facing a few 
challenges 
(his 
soon-to-be 

wife thinking he was going 

to murder her when he drove 
her to an empty field at 4:00 
a.m., realizing the hot air 
balloon pilot would come up 
with them in that tiny basket 
and another couple going up 
on a balloon next to them 
and the guy proposing to his 
girlfriend with a massive sign), 
Minhaj drove her to the closest 
breakfast place he could find 
that was open (Applebee’s) and 
proposed. 

This show was everything 

I wanted it to be and more. As 
Minhaj has stated earlier in his 
Netflix special “Hasan Minhaj: 
Homecoming 
King,” 
there 

weren’t many people of similar 
backgrounds for him to look 
up to while growing up. Going 
to school, dating and pursuing 
his passions all came with their 
own complications in addition 
to his confusion with identity 
as an Indian American from a 
Muslim family. Looking at the 
audience last weekend, it was 
clear that others felt the same 
way. But in simply sharing his 
stories, Minhaj is telling us it’s 
okay, because we’ve all faced 
similar challenges, and now 
we’re better for it. 

“Before 
the 
Storm” 
was 

just a taste of how Minhaj 
seamlessly talks about pressing 
issues in today’s American 
society without becoming too 
dark. 
Sometimes 
the 
truth 

can be hard-hitting, but with 
Minhaj’s 
eyes 
bugging 
out 

every five seconds and his self-
deprecating personal stories, 
it’s much less scary with lots of 
laughter.

It has become something of 

a tradition for me to begin the 
year by writing about Strange 
Beautiful Music, an annual 
contemporary music marathon 
put 
on 
by 
the 
musicians’ 

collective New Music Detroit 
— and who am I to break with 
tradition?

Running now for 11 years, the 

Strange Beautiful concerts had 
their latest iteration over the 
weekend, and there’s as much 
to say about them as ever. This 
year the marathon was divided 
across two days and three 
different venues, presenting a 
genre-defying hodgepodge of 
performances. Friday saw the 
Charles H. Wright Museum 
of African American History 
and The Detroit Institute of 
Art play host to a variety of 
different sets, and Saturday 
saw 10 hours of music at the 
Detroit Symphony Orchestra’s 
The 
Cube. 
Due 
to 
the 

expansiveness of the events, I 
wasn’t able to catch the entire 
marathon (missing the Wright 
Museum sets on Friday), but 
what I did see proved to be 
an effective reminder of the 
cultural vibrancy of Southeast 
Michigan’s avant-garde music 

scene.

Friday evening’s sets in The 

DIA were intense and viscerally 
moving in a way that I haven’t 
encountered too many times 
in my life. The performance 

space was the Rivera Court, 
a spacious chamber in the 
center of the museum named 
after the painter of the famous 
“Detroit Industry” murals that 
adorn its walls, Diego Rivera. 
I arrived partway through 
a performance by the James 
Cornish Light Opera, a group 
of some 13 musicians and two 
dancers, who were performing 

a musical interpretation of the 
poem “I Come From There” by 
the late Mahmoud Darwish, a 
poet who has been called the 
national poet of Palestine. I 
later learned that the music 
and 
dancing 
were 
largely 

improvised, but by that time I 

was taken by the raw emotion 
of it. Making use of drones and 
a free sort of meter, the sonic 
space the musicians created 
was meditative and ritualistic, 
infused 
with 
the 
sort 
of 

aching 
melancholy 
familiar 

to those who have yearned 
for 
something 
unattainable. 

By 
the 
end, 
however, 
the 

music turned ferocious and 
terrifying, a clamour that filled 
the reverberant walls with a 
harrowing sound of apocalypse, 
a thunderous noise that left me 
shaken to the core. The best 
way I can describe the music is 
simply as essential (in the true 
sense of something being part 
of one’s essence) and somehow 
referential to a longing at the 
core of the human spirit.

After a brief interlude the 

next set went on, Marcus 
Elliot’s 
Beyond 
Rebellious 

Ensemble. 
Made 
up 
of 
a 

rotating cast of characters, this 
weekend’s version of the group 
played a set of tunes coming 
out of the avant garde jazz 
tradition. Elliot, as bandleader 
and 
conductor, 
provided 
a 

collection 
of 
melodies 
and 

structures 
beforehand, 
and 

during the performance would 
direct the feeling of the music 
and cue the ensemble as needed 
throughout, 
occasionally 

writing directions on a small 
whiteboard he would show 
to the group. Afterward he 

described 
this 
process 
as 

“conduction,” a term which 
he credited to the composer 
Butch Morris. The set itself 
was incredibly engaging — 
one man who sat to my right 
described it as “transcendent” 
— and incredibly varied. At 
some moments there were 
catchy head tunes I later 
found myself whistling, and at 
other times there were wild, 
raucous explosions of sound or 
ethereal squeals that offered a 
new perspective on the sorts 
of sound an ensemble like that 
could produce.

Saturday featured around 

10 hours of performances 
at the DSO. As one might 
expect, these ranged widely 
in style, tone and genre, varied 
in such a way that nothing 
ever seemed to grow stale. 
As one also might expect, I 
won’t touch on everything 
that happened during the 10 
hours, but I do feel like it’s 
important to mention a few of 
the performances that I found 
to be the most meaningful.

One 
of 
the 
more 

conventional 
groups 
to 

perform on Saturday was the 
Detroit Composers’ Project, a 
collective formed by composer 
Harriet Steinke (who was a 
peer of mine a couple summers 
ago at a music program in 
Paris) to promote the work of 
Michigan-based 
composers. 

When 
I 
say 
conventional, 

it’s important not to think 
of it as a pejorative; I say 
“conventional” only insofar 
as it refers to what you tend 
to 
find 
at 
“contemporary 

classical” 
concerts, 
which 

is to say classical musicians 
performing notated music on 
classical 
instruments. 
The 

project already premiered a 
number of compositions earlier 
this month, at the DIA, and it 
was a delight for those of us

who weren’t able to attend the 
first show for them to present a 
set at Strange Beautiful Music. 
The group played a variety of 
compositions, each with its own 
personality, and by the end one 
was left with a good impression 
of the diversity of music being 
made contemporary classical 
scene today.

This impression of musical 

diversity was only augmented as 
the day went on. Another group 
stemming from the classical 
tradition was the University’s 
own Contemporary Directions 
Ensemble, 
which 
presented 

a 
stunning 
program 
of 

works 
from 
three 
living 

women 
composers, 
Anna 

Thorvaldsdottir, 
Angélica 

Negrón and Julia Wolfe. The 
Thorvaldsdottir in particular 
was wonderful and spacious, 
enveloping the listener in a 
meditative sound-world until, 
near the end, a beautiful melody 
appeared, 
breaking 
through 

the music like sunlight through 
clouds. Set in contrast to the 
Wolfe, which was thrillingly 
energetic, the piece made quite 
a lasting impression.

Throughout 
the 
rest 
of 

the day audience members 
heard from groups like the 
freewheeling and noisey group 
ONO, 
the 
“sono-cybernetic 

exoskeleton”-donning 
Synergistic Mythologies, the 
experimental band saajtak, the 
New Music Detroit collective 
itself — I could go on, but 
the point is that there wasn’t 
any one dominant idea at 
the marathon. It was a wild, 
wacky amalgamation of all of 
the vaguely out-there music 
being made around Detroit, 
and 
a 
beautiful 
reflection 

of the artistic diversity of 
the 
city. 
Strange 
Beautiful 

Music continues to be an 
invaluable platform for the 
avant-garde, the weird and the 
unclassifiable, and one of the 
highlights of the year.

MUSIC REVIEW

When I stumbled on All Are 

Saved in early 2015, approaching 
my high school graduation, I was 
certain I didn’t think I would be 
writing this review almost four 
years later. My graduation from 
university is now more imminent 
than is comfortable. I remember 
vacationing in Folly Beach, S.C. 
during spring break, the same 

week that Carrie & Lowell was 
released to the world at large. I 
was just beginning to find music 
for myself, exploring Stereogum, 
Pitchfork, Consequence of Sound 
and NPR and digesting every 
word as gospel.

One morning during that week 

of vacation, I was seeking out new 
music on Pitchfork and found 
it: Fred Thomas’s All Are Saved, 
with a clean little “8.0” next to 

the album cover. I had recently 
paid my enrollment deposit to 
the University, and a line in the 
first paragraph of the review read 
“Fred Thomas is always standing 
right behind you at a basement 
show in Ann Arbor.” Some quick 
research revealed that Thomas 
had been a mainstay of the 
southeast Mich. scene for over 
20 years by then — 25 by now. 
Although I had only been to town 
a couple of times then, I was more 
than prepared to make Thomas’s 
music mine, something literally 
close to home that I could latch 
onto.

All Are Saved was Thomas’s 

ninth solo album, but the first to 
receive any real critical attention. 
Changer, a more guitar-driven 
effort with hints of power-pop, 
arrived in early 2017, falling 

into a neat narrative surrounding 
Thomas’s life: He had gotten 
married, quit his job and moved 
to Montreal where his wife would 
be getting her graduate degree. 
Now, Aftering has been pitched 
as the end of an informal trilogy, 
in part nonspecific reflections 
penned from abroad — Thomas 
watching from the outside as his 
home country elected Trump 
— and in part hyper-personal 
anecdote.

The best way to think about 

the concept of Aftering is as a 
long walk off a short pier. Or a 
dead sprint straight off the edge 
of a cliff, followed by a careful 
narration 
of 
the 
seemingly 

endless fall. The first five songs on 
the album, especially “Hopeless 
Ocean Drinker,” “Good Times 
Are Gone Again” and “Altar,” are 
pure melody, catchy guitar and 
keyboard hooks under Thomas’s 
sometimes 
endearingly 
off-

key vocals. The album opener, 
“Ridiculous 
Landscapes,” 

features 
the 
Montreal-based 

Common Holly and Detroit-
based Anna Burch, whose music 
Thomas forwarded directly to 

Polyvinyl, earning her a contract. 
Both will be joining Thomas for a 
fall tour.

Following the rush of “Altar,” 

things 
go 
downhill 
quickly 

— imagine the rug pulled out 
from under your feet, only to 
reveal that there was no floor 
beneath it. “House Show, Late 
December” is the embodiment 
of that immediate anxiety, the 
plunge into the lake waiting at the 
end of the pier. It’s a steamroller 
that builds and builds as Thomas 
just talks at you, only a hint of 
sing-song in his voice. Thomas’s 
nostalgic 
musings 
removed, 

the song could easily pass as 
something by Explosions in the 
Sky. The last three songs follow 
suit. If “House Show” is the 
plunge, the rest of the album is 
the realization of how damn cold 

that water is, how slow things 
move, the tragedy of youth and 
memory and growing up. It’s half-

conscious confusion and sharp 
self-awareness in equal measure, 

all over fuzzed out electronics, 
keyboard 
and 
carefully 

orchestrated strings. 

When I interviewed Thomas 

earlier this year, I asked him if he 
could name a number of artists or 
albums that have influenced or 
continue to influence his writing. 
He responded saying that, though 
it may sound pretentious, his 
inspirations are largely just his 
experiences 
(though 
he 
has 

uploaded a playlist to Spotify 
titled “Aftering Mood Board”) 
and it’s evident that this is more or 
less true. “Alcohol Poisoning” and 
“House Show, Late December” 
function in concert as reflections 
on the difficulties of touring and 
the anxiety that accompanies 
being a local artist who is trying 
to get by on their art alone, spoken 
from the mouth of the ultimate 

lifer. Meanwhile, “What The 
Sermon Said” dives deep 
into Thomas’s childhood. He 
recalls the child miscreant 
he was, and how he couldn’t 
make friends his own age, 
and how his family never 
went back to that church.

“Mother, 
Daughter, 

Pharmaprix” 
includes 
an 

anecdote about a mother and 
daughter arguing in French: 
the daughter who “simply 
hates her / With that blinding 
burning meanness only teens 
get / Like she has to / Like her 
mom did to her mom / Like 
we all do,” and the mother 
who “loves her so much that 
she’s constantly terrified.” 
Thomas’s storytelling here 
is at its best: He takes a 
simple interaction and teases 
something 
like 
objective 

truth out of it. He can’t 
speak the language but he 
understands the subtext all 
too well; we weren’t there, 
but we can see it in ourselves. 
This, it seems, is Thomas’s 
ultimate goal, and one he 
approaches with an alarming 
urgency: to find solidarity, 
connection and empathy in 
the days when good times are 
gone again.

The conclusion of Fred 
Thomas’s trilogy is an 
anxious ice bath

Aftering

Fred Thomas 

Polyvinyl 

The 
#MeToo 
movement, 

revealing and cathartic as it has 
been, has also felt profoundly 
disorienting. There’s little that 
hasn’t been dredged up and laid 
bare on a mental dissection table 
for study. Who are these people 
we thought we knew? What 
should we make of experiences 
we hadn’t made anything of 
before? And as consumers of 
pop culture, what role have we 
played in it all? How badly have 
our own concepts of love and 
boundaries been warped and 

corrupted?

“You,” a thrilling new series 

from Lifetime, is a remarkably 
sharp attempt to grapple with 
those questions. It begins in 
an Upper East Side bookstore, 
where 
Joe 
(Penn 
Badgley, 

“Gossip Girl”), the manager, 
encounters Beck (Elizabeth Lail, 
“Once Upon a Time”) a doe-eyed 
MFA student in search of some 
Paula Fox essays. It’s the meet-
cute that launched a thousand 
romances — they gossip about 
the other customers, lapse into 
playful banter and trade reading 
recommendations.

But it doesn’t take long inside 

Joe’s inner monologue for us 
to realize that our sensitive 

bookstore owner is in fact r/
TheRedPill 
personified, 
a 

deeply insecure creep with a 
toxic savior complex that deems 
Beck a damsel worthy of his 
rescue. It might be a touch on 
the nose that Beck’s given name 
is Guinevere.

Oh, 
how 
quickly 
one 

fleeting 
interaction 
turns 

into a dangerous obsession. 
Joe has soon pored through 
Beck’s 
social 
media, 
found 

her 
apartment, 
studied 
her 

relationships and learned her 
routines, 
all 
while 
making 

grand, improbable conclusions 
about the sort of person she 
must be: “Every account is set to 
public — you want to be seen.” 
Most frightening is the ease 
with which he’s able to convince 
himself that everything he’s 
doing is just fine. Hiding in 
Beck’s shower, after her early 
return cuts his apartment break-
in short, Joe laughs the whole 
thing off in a voice-over. “I’ve 
seen enough romantic comedies 
to know that guys like me are 
always getting in jams like this.”

It’s a smart indictment of our 

culture — the Western canon 
has always reassured the Joes 
of the world that nice guys 
win in the end. In one telling 
scene, he brings home a copy of 
“Don Quixote” for his forlorn 
kid neighbor. “It’s about a guy 
who believes in chivalry, so he 
decides to become an old-school 
knight,” Joe tells him. Um, 
aren’t you forgetting something, 
Joe? The Man of La Mancha was 
delusional.

“You” is sometimes weakened 

by its tendency toward the 

absurd — let’s just say there’s a 
giant plexiglass book repair cell 
in the basement of Joe’s store 
that may or may not function as 
a makeshift torture chamber. 
But in other moments, “You” 
is buoyed by its disinterest in 
being tethered to reality or 
subtlety. It’s what keeps the 
show exciting and gives it the 
freedom to wander around New 
York, poking fun of Brooklynite 
caricatures, 
like 
Beck’s 

insufferable ex-boyfriend Benji 
(Lou Taylor Pucci, “The Story of 
Luke”), whose line of artisanal 
soda is, in his words, “legit, 
period.”

And for all the fun “You” is, it 

manages to stay terrifying and 
familiar. In the wake of #MeToo, 
some men have lamented that 
they’re being forced to reassess 
their every move and gesture 
lest they be misinterpreted. 
It’s ironic, because, as “You” 
illustrates, that’s exactly the 
sort of mental calculus women 
have to perform all the time. 
When Beck pays for her book 
with a credit card, Joe decides it 
must be a deliberate invitation: 
“You have enough cash to cover 
this, but you want me to know 
your name.” There is nothing 
quite like the terror of moving 
through the world constantly 
wondering whether the quiet 
guy at the bookstore might 
really be a deranged chauvinist.

If “You” stays smart and 

probing, it could function as a 
thoughtful look at romance in 
the digital age. At the very least, 
the pilot offers a few pointers 
upfront: Keep your blinds closed 
and your Instagram private.

FILM REVIEW

In what more closely resembles 

a melodramatic mystery than 
reality, Tim Wardle’s (“One Killer 
Punch”) shocking documentary 
breaks conventions in style and 
tone to tell a true story that 
can only be described as jaw-

dropping. 
“Three 
Identical 

Strangers” tells the story of 
identical triplets, Robert Shafran, 
Edward 
Galland 
and 
David 

Kellman, 
separated 
at 
birth 

and placed into three different 
homes. Their reunion led them 
to become global sensations, 
appearing on TV shows and 
even checking out Madonna in 
“Desperately Seeking Susan.” 
The three brothers even opened 
a restaurant together in New 
York 
City, 
not 
surprisingly 

dubbed “Triplets.” What seems 
like a happily-ever-after type 
of tale twists itself into a dark 
nightmarish saga of deception, 
experimentation and loss as the 
nature of the triplets’ adoption 
becomes more clear.

The documentary combines 

home videos with talking heads 
footage 
alongside 
tastefully 

shadowed re-enactments. The 
re-enactments are not forced; 
rather, they create a narrative 
as twisted as the reality the 
triplets faced. In a way, the 
re-enactments make the story 
feel more fictional, played by 
curly-headed lookalikes of the 
triplets clad in striped polos 
and flared jeans. The triplets’ 
first-hand 
accounts 
of 
their 

story emphasize the reality of it, 
reminding the viewer that the 
film before them is unfortunately 
not fiction at all. Sooner rather 
than later, the viewer might 
notice the absence of one-third 
of the triplets. While Shafran 
and Kellman have a lot to say 
in their interviews, Galland is 
mysteriously not present. As the 
film progresses, the viewer will 
come to understand the dark 
nature of Galland’s absence.

The film slowly unravels the 

mystery of the triplets’ separation 
keeping the viewer engrossed 
until the very last minute. What 
is uncovered is the fact that the 
triplets were separated for the 
purpose of scientific study. A 
psychiatrist by the name of Peter 
B. Neubauer, an Austrian Jew 
who escaped Nazi occupation, 
led dozens of these “twin-
studies” that separated twins and 
triplets into different families 
based on economic status and 
parenting style to discover the 
real difference between nature 
and nurture. Children adopted 

through the Louise Wise Agency 
with help from the Jewish Board 
of Family and Children’s Services 
were used for these experiments, 
unbeknownst to the adopted 
parents or the children.

For years, the triplets were 

not privy to files that detailed 
the purpose of their separation; 
in fact, the adoption agency 
that handled their case and so 
many other twin separations 
have sealed the files until the 
year 
2066. 
However, 
since 

the film’s release and other 
twin discoveries, some of the 
information regarding the study 
has been released to individuals 
who were adopted from the 
Louise Wise Agency. Still, there 
are dozens of people out there 
who have no idea that they have a 
twin. Wardle’s film has inspired 
many to investigate their pasts 
and has even led to reunions 
of siblings that had no idea the 
other existed.

The 
most 
unsettling 
part 

of 
the 
film 
is 
the 
human 

experimentation that took place 
without knowledge or consent. 
Even more troubling is the Jewish 
adoption agency and the Jewish 
researcher that re-created these 
Mengele-esque experiments on 
Jews in a post-Holocaust United 
States. Many draw an ethical 
comparison between Neubauer’s 
twin experiments to those of the 
Nazi regime, making the irony 
devastatingly clear.

Patterson needs backup
S

hea 

Patterson 
has played 
even better 
than the 
most 
optimistic 
Michigan 
fans could 
have expected.
Saturday’s 45-20 win over 
SMU was the most recent 
example. And yes, it’s only a 
three-game sample, but the 
consistency and prolificity 
with which Patterson has 
played in those three games 
is something that hasn’t been 
seen in Ann Arbor since … 
maybe Denard Robinson, but 
probably Chad Henne.
It’s certainly the best 
quarterback play Wolverines 
coach Jim Harbaugh has had 
in his tenure.
“Accuracy, really. His reads 
feel really good, he’s making 
really good decisions,” 
Harbaugh said after the 
game. “… He’s getting out of 
trouble and creating plays 
when sometimes there isn’t 
one to be there. Just playing 
really — playing the position 
really well. And then making 
the throws when they present 
themselves. He’s hitting 
the short ones, he’s hitting 
the intermediate ones, he’s 
hitting the deep ones. Good 
quarterback play.”
Strong quarterback play 
is something that Michigan 
has been searching for since 
Harbaugh has arrived in 
Ann Arbor. Jake Rudock 
showed flashes in 2015, but 
the supporting cast around 
him wasn’t ready, and Rudock 
didn’t have the physical talent 
Patterson has.
The last two seasons, 
Wilton Speight, Brandon 
Peters and John O’Korn were 
surrounded by elite athletes, 
but couldn’t put it all together 

to lead the Wolverines to the 
promised land.
Patterson is that 
quarterback. The throws that 
were missed in past losses, 
like the ones against Iowa in 
2016 or to Michigan State and 
Ohio State in 
2017 — he can 
make those. 
We’ve already 
seen it.
Patterson is 
now 46-for-65 
for 589 passing 
yards and six 
touchdowns 
this season, 
including three 
touchdowns 
each in the last two games. 
Michigan hadn’t thrown 
three touchdowns in a game 
since Nov. 5, 2016, against 
Maryland. Last season’s 
team didn’t have six passing 

touchdowns until the ninth 
game of the season.
“We’ve had Jake Rudock 
here, and there’s problems 
that are beyond the scope of 
a quarterback, but in terms 
of how our offense efficiently 
played and how 
Shea looked, 
I’d say it’s as 
good as any 
quarterback 
I’ve seen here,” 
said fifth-year 
senior defensive 
end Chase 
Winovich after 
the Wolverines’ 
win over 
Western 
Michigan two weeks ago. 
“It was weird being on the 
sideline and them just scoring 
touchdowns. I remember 
(junior safety) Josh Metellus 
… he goes, I just remember 

him sitting there looking, he’s 
like ‘Man, this is nice!’ I think 
the feeling is mutual from my 
half.”
It’s ironic, then, that now 
that Michigan and Harbaugh 
finally have the quarterback 
who can make 
all the throws, 
question marks 
have popped up 
around the rest 
of the roster.
It isn’t the 
offensive line, 
though they 
have struggled, 
because that 
position has 
been a trouble 
area for at least the last two 
seasons.
What is different is that the 
defense that made Michigan 
a force to be reckoned with in 
the Harbaugh era has looked 

vulnerable at times.
The things that put 
the Wolverines in a hole 
against Notre Dame popped 
up again Saturday. There 
were penalties and missed 
assignments that, against a 
better team, 
might be a 
death sentence. 
Heck, if it was 
last year’s 
offense that 
was on the field 
against the 
Mustangs, the 
defensive lapses 
might have 
been a death 
sentence, too.
But it wasn’t, because 
Patterson made play after 
play and throw after throw. 
Michigan, for the second 
week in a row, scored more 
points than it scored in any 

game last season.
SMU’s first touchdown 
came when the Wolverines 
miscommunicated in 
coverage, and wide receiver 
James Proche ran wide open 
up the sideline for a 50-yard 
pitch and catch. On the 
next drive, Patterson drove 
Michigan right back down 
the field, 60 yards in five 
plays. He capped it off with 
a 35-yard toss to sophomore 
wide receiver Donovan 
Peoples-Jones.
It wasn’t a hard throw, as 
Peoples-Jones was wide open, 
but in the past year or so, 
even the easy throws couldn’t 
be taken for granted.
“The thing about Shea is 
that he just has such a sense 
of confidence that doesn’t 
come off as cocky, but you 
just know and he knows — 
this is my opinion about it — 
that he’s the man,” Winovich 
said last week. “He’s the man 
for the job, and he can get the 
job done. I think for him, it 
was just another day at the 
office.”
I think I have written 
this part in every one of my 
columns, but I do feel it’s 
appropriate to repeat when 
being critical this early in the 
season. It would be misguided 
to say that there are problems 
that will not be fixed, or at 
least patched up enough to 
win any game moving forward 
— especially for a team with 
this talent. 
But if the rest of the 
Wolverines don’t solidify 
themselves, this season 
might feel like a huge missed 
opportunity. Because Shea 
Patterson is the quarterback 
Michigan has wanted. It 
would be a shame to let that 
go to waste.

The good, the bad and the ugly: SMU

The good: Patterson/Peoples-
Jones connection

In Saturday’s postgame press 
conference, a reporter asked junior 
quarterback Shea Patterson and 
sophomore wide receiver Donovan 
Peoples-Jones about one of the 
duo’s three touchdown connections 
on the day — a back-shoulder fade 
to move the score to 28-7.
Is that something you regularly 
practice?
Both paused. Patterson glanced 
at Peoples-Jones and smiled.
It took everyone in the receiving 
corps some time to feel comfortable 
with the new signal-caller. 
But after some time, it seems 
Peoples-Jones 
and 
Patterson 
— each former glistening five-
star talents — have found that 
comfortability, and the offense, is 
being rewarded in droves.
Saturday, Peoples-Jones notched 
the first three-touchdown game 
from a Michigan wide receiver 
since Jehu Chesson scored four 
touchdowns against Indiana in 
2015. It is also Peoples-Jones’ first 
multi-touchdown game, as the 
former top wide receiver commit 
in the country continues to show an 
ever-expanding toolset.
The first touchdown came on a 
crossing route late in the first half. 
He glided across the field, caught 
a dart from Patterson and turned 
up field for a 35-yard score. Then 
came the back-shoulder fade — the 
first such score in recent Michigan 
history (with only exaggeration). 
The ability to adjust his body, find 
the ball and get his feet down 
offered the clearest sign of a wide 
receiver with a world of potential 
starting to put it together.
The 
throw 
— 
from 
the 
quarterback completing nearly 80 
percent of his passes — was on the 
money.
Then, to cap it off, Patterson 
found Peoples-Jones in stride on 
a 41-yard deep post for a score, a 
route Harbaugh called “terrific” 
and a throw he deemed “right on 
the money.”
Peoples-Jones finished the day 
with four catches for 90 yards and 
three touchdowns, a banner day for 

a receiver and a quarterback who 
seem to just be getting started.

The bad: the secondary

If you’d never heard of James 
Proche before Saturday, the SMU 
receiver 
offered 
a 
memorable 
introduction. 
Proche 
pranced 
around the Michigan secondary 
all day, catching everything in sight 
and drawing pass intereference 
calls on the off chance he didn’t.
In the end, Proche tallied 11 
catches for 166 yards and two 
touchdowns. That seems low.
While Proche, who has over 
100 career catches and nearly 
2000 yards, has clear talent, it’s a 
foreboding sign that an American 
Athletic Conference receiver had 
his way with a secondary that is 
supposed to be one of the nation’s 
best.
Juniors Lavert Hill, David Long 
and Josh Metellus, along with 
several others, took their shot at the 
Mustangs’ top receiver. Time and 
time again, Proche had his way.
One such error included a simple 
wheel route from the slot, crossing 
with a receiver running to the 

middle of the field. Metellus and 
sophomore safety Brad Hawkins 
had a miscommunication on the 
coverage, leading to a walk-in 
50-yard touchdown to tie the game 
at seven.
All this complementing the 
seven penalties that plagued the 
defense — many of which came on 
pass interference calls. 
With Big Ten play set to begin, 
Michigan’s secondary simply has 
to be better. The margin for error 
is going to get much slimmer in the 
coming weeks.

The ugly: penalties*

You won’t win many games with 
13 penalties for 137 yards. Against 
SMU, it can be used as a harmless 
teaching point. Against a formidable 
opponent, it could be a back-breaker.
On the verge of Big Ten play, 
Harbaugh will be sure to emphasize 
the former.
“My point is, you address each 
of them,” Harbaugh said. “And 
penalties are hurting us. That’s 
something we have to clean up and 
get better at. We address each one 
— technique, what we’re using, the 

discipline that we have. Get them 
corrected, get them coached, get 
improved. Don’t want 13 penalties 
in a game.”
Some 
of 
them, 
Harbaugh 
disagreed 
with. 
Some 
even 
emphatically so. 
In the third quarter, junior 
VIPER 
Khaleke 
Hudson 
was 
ejected for targeting. Harbaugh — 
and anyone who was asked about it 
after the game — took objection to 
that call in particular.
The point remains, though, 
that it’s among the flaws the 
Wolverines will seek to correct 
going forward. Perhaps based on 
the sheer randomness of penalties, 
it’s less dire than other flaws (say, 
pass protection or safety play), but 
penalties reared their ugly head on 
Saturday.

*This section noticeably leaves 
out SMU coach Sonny Dykes 
kicking an onside kick with a 
player who wasn’t a kicker, then 
promptly getting penalized for 
it. This is a Michigan publication. 
Unfortunately, this play did not 
qualify for publication. It was, 
however, quite ugly.

FIELD HOCKEY 
‘M’ opens Big Ten play

It wasn’t overtime and it 
wasn’t a game winner but the 
No. 10 Michigan field hockey 
team (1-0 Big Ten, 4-3 overall) 
notched 
its 
third 
straight 
victory Friday night.
Once again, senior forward 
Emma Way is to thank.
After an onslaught of seven 
goals in six games to start the 
season, including two overtime 
winners last weekend, Way’s 
dominance came in a more 
balanced manner on Friday. 
She assisted two goals in the 
Wolverines’ 3-1 win over No. 17 
Rutgers (0-1, 5-1).
Freshman 
midfielder 
Kathryn Peterson opened the 
scoring 25 minutes in with 
her first collegiate goal on a 
left-handed shot past Scarlet 
Knights goalie Gianna Glatz.
“It’s 
just 
fun,” 
Peterson 
said. “And my family was 
here so that was a little more 
significant, but it was just one 
of those goals with a good 
feeling about it.”
Of course, it was Way on the 
assist. Way came around the 
backside of Michigan’s press to 
receive the ball just outside of 
the circle, where she passed it 
beyond the last defender into 
Peterson’s path.
“She’s 
just 
a 
machine,” 
Peterson said. “She’s just a 
captain that gets the job done. 
You can look to her for an 
example.
“Emma’s getting her part 
done, so you gotta go get your 
part done.”
Minutes after the halftime 
break, Way notched her second 
assist of the game. This time, 
she received a corner at the 
top of the circle, dragged the 
ball to her left and unleashed 
a ferocious shot into traffic. 
Another freshman, midfielder 
Sofia Southam, got her stick to 
the ball to deflect it past Glatz.
But once again, Way was at 
the center of the Wolverines’ 
offense.
“She’s just such a special 
player,” said Michigan coach 
Marcia Pankratz. “She does 

some things that a lot of other 
players can’t even imagine 
doing.”
Unfortunately for Pankratz, 
last year’s loss of Big Ten Player 
of the Year Katie Trombetta 
means she no longer has a 
defensive counterpart to Way. 
Early in the season, that posed 
a challenge for the Wolverines, 
who allowed 10 goals in three 
early losses after posting 16 
shutouts in 24 tries last year.
With 
three 
consecutive 
games of allowing just one 
goal, that tide may be shifting. 
Michigan’s 
defensive 
spirit 
was evident on a play late in 
the first half when Rutgers 
appeared to have tied the 
game before redshirt freshman 
defender Abbey Hutton raced 
back to slap the ball away from 
the Wolverines’ goal line.
“It’s not luck that she was in 
the right position to get that 
ball out,” Pankratz said. “She’s 
a smart player, and she was in 
the right position to make that 
happen.
“It’s a very, very young 
defense. … It’s tremendous 
what they’ve been able to 
accomplish. They’ve been really 
disciplined and communicate 
well, and they’ve been playing 
with a lot of confidence, so I’ve 
been proud of them.”
In the end, Way once again 
sealed the win for Michigan, 
extending her goal streak to six 
games in the process.
Like her second assist, she 
received a corner at the top of 
the circle. This time, she baited 
two Rutgers defenders into 
charging at her before calmly 
taking the ball around them 
and ripping a shot to the near 
post to make it 3-1, Wolverines.
With 
that, 
Michigan 
completed a dominating win 
in which it controlled the game 
from start to finish against an 
undefeated Rutgers team.
“We 
owned 
our 
house,” 
Peterson said. “And we shut 
them down when it mattered.”
After whiffing on each of 
their marquee non-conference 
win opportunities, that was 
exactly the start to Big Ten play 
that the Wolverines needed.

EVAN AARON/Daily
Junior quarterback Shea Patterson has proven he is the most talented quarterback of coach Jim Harbaugh’s tenure, but he’ll need some help from his teammates.

“His reads feel 
really good, he’s 
making really 
good decisions.”

“He’s the man 
for the job, and 
he can get the 
job done.”

Two units and two perspectives 
A

s 

Donovan 
Peoples-Jones 
surveys the 
media during 
postgame 
interviews, he 
compliments 
his 
quarterback 
for sparking his collegiate 
breakthrough performance.
Peoples-Jones found the end 
zone three times in Michigan’s 
45-20 victory over SMU, so a little 
praise was warranted. That very 
quarterback, junior Shea Patter-
son, sits beside the wide receiver 
on stage, squeezing his shoulder 
after the shoutout.
“I feel like we’ve been doing 
a heck of a better job,” Peoples-
Jones says of the offense. “Today 
showed improvement, but we’ve 
gotta keep working hard.”
It is a snapshot of a quarterback-
wide receiver duo that has been 
there, done that in the past. They 
see the offense is clicking — it has 
outscored last season’s high of 36 
points in consecutive games.
Shortly after, Chase Winovich 
walks into the room with his 
chest puffed but an expression of 
nonchalance. The fifth-year senior 
defensive end is asked if he thinks 
the defense is as dominant as 
advertised.
“I feel like you’re pigeonholing 
me into a response,” Winovich 
says through a grin.
The answer to the question, for 
those with eyes and a television, 
was a resounding “no.” Allowing 
20 points — 15.7 per game on aver-
age — wouldn’t qualify as domi-
nant, though it’s a far cry from a 
concern.
But giving up 166 yards and 
two touchdowns to the Mustangs’ 
James Proche is. Seven defensive 
penalties — 13 in total — are. Espe-
cially when you are expected to be 
a top-five defense in the country.
“I think we played pretty 
decent and we could do a lot 

better,” said junior safety Josh 
Metellus, who recorded a pivotal 
pick-six on Saturday. “We strive 
on being the best defense in the 
nation.
“Today, we didn’t really look 
like it.”
The dichotomy between the 
offensive excitement and defen-
sive indifference is uncharacteris-
tic, but unsurprising. The stalwart 
defense believes it’s trending in 
the wrong direction, while the 
identity-seeking offense believes 
the opposite. Both could be true, 
but that doesn’t guarantee the 
same results. Problems with pen-
alties and giving up long plays 
— those plaguing the Wolverines 
against SMU — have slowly been 
injected into their character.
Michigan has committed 27 
penalties through three games 
— 113th in the country. A stag-
gering 21 have come on defense, 
12 of which have resulted in first 
downs. Call it early season rust, 
but that time is evaporating. Call 
it a byproduct of Don Brown’s 
aggressive defense — one that’s 
ranked in the top five nationally 
the past three seasons — but you 

must question if it’s worth it, espe-
cially with the toughest games 
ahead.
“How we see ourselves is how 
we performed in the most recent 
game, and I felt like we made a 
lot of mistakes, especially with 
penalties,” Winovich said. “… That 
was not ideal, especially when 
you can’t be extending drives. I 
feel like SMU wasn’t able to take 
advantage of those as other teams 
down the road will.”
Against Western Michigan 
on Sept. 8, penalties and mental 
lapses were excusable — three 
of six defensive flags came in 
garbage time after all. You’d be 
hard-pressed to find a comment 
more boilerplate than “we need to 
improve next week.”
Now, the offense and defense 
combined for another blowout 
against the Mustangs, but with 
incongruent evaluations of their 
respective units. Redshirt junior 
tight end Zach Gentry thought the 
offense was “getting better every 
week” with “a lot more to prove.”
The forthright Winovich was 
hardly as anticipative.
“It seemed like we were a lot 

more confident in the way the 
game went last week, in terms of 
just positivity,” Winovich said, 
“And just, I don’t know — I don’t 
want to say that we were like, ‘Gee, 
oh my god, this is amazing.’ But we 
were definitely more optimistic, 
just the way things had gone.
“... This week, it just felt like we 
had a lot mistakes and stuff that 
we need to address. And that was 
kind of the attitude. Especially in 
our minds, now shifted to Nebras-
ka, Big Ten play. There’s both of 
those coming into play. We’re not 
getting too high on this win.”
The sentiment comes as a reck-
oning for the Wolverines as the Big 
Ten slate commences. The rose-
colored glasses are off on Michi-
gan’s strongest unit, impermeable 
to Jim Harbaugh’s coachspeak.
The Wolverines didn’t look 
like a team that took a uniform 
step forward yesterday. But it just 
depends who you believe, the 
offense or the defense.

Youth gets first action at 
the Spartan Invitational

John Tatter was supposed to 
run his first collegiate cross-
country race close to home.
The Winston-Salem, N.C. 
native — along with the rest 
of the Michigan men’s cross 
country team — was originally 
slated to compete in a meet 
hosted 
by 
North 
Carolina 
State. It would have been the 
perfect start to a career, the 
chance to show off his stuff 
to family and friends while 
getting acclimated to the world 
of college cross country.
But sometimes, things don’t 
work out the way they’re 
supposed to, and for Tatter and 
the rest of the team, there was 
a change of plans.
Because 
of 
Hurricane 
Florence, 
Michigan 
coach 
Kevin Sullivan decided he 
didn’t want to risk the safety of 
his team by traveling to North 
Carolina. Soon after that, the 
meet was cancelled and the 
Wolverines were forced to find 
a contingency plan. So instead 
of competing at North Carolina 
State, Michigan sent its young 
runners to the Auto Owners’ 
Spartan Invitational, featuring 
No. 24 Michigan State and 
several local teams — many 
of which compete in Division 
II or the NAIA — while its 
regular top four stayed home 
to train.
The 
Wolverines 
placed 
second as a team — behind the 
Spartans — with a total of 58 
points. Tatter placed sixth with 
a time of 25:21.4 and finished 
as 
Michigan’s 
top-ranked 
individual. It seemed like an 
uninspiring performance for 
a team that last year won the 
Big Ten Championships. But 
in some meets, the total focus 
is on winning while others are 
more for development, and this 
was one of the latter.

“We decided that we would 
leave our top four runners at 
home to train (because) they’d 
get better benefit from training 
through this week than racing 
here 
at 
Michigan 
State,” 
Sullivan said. “ … A lot of it was 
about gaining experience. For 
a lot of these guys, it was their 
first time running 8K and it’s 
a little bit different from what 
they deal with in high school.”
Still, Tatter’s performance 
flashed 
potential. 
Used 
to 
running the 5000-meter race, 
Tatter held his own at the 
longer 
distance 
and 
made 
his case for cracking the 
Wolverines’ lineup later in the 
season.
Redshirt sophomore Joost 
Plaetnick 
also 
impressed, 
finishing ninth with a time of 
25:28.2.
“(He) had probably his best 
competition for us in uniform,” 
Sullivan said.
And despite the lack of 
top finishers, five Michigan 
runners placed in the top 20 
— Tatter, Plaetnick, redshirt 
sophomore 
Jacob 
Branch, 
freshman Gabe Mudel and 
redshirt junior Kevin Hall.
With 
the 
Wolverines’ 
change in plans came a change 
in expectations. Michigan’s 
mindset shifted from that of 
the reigning Big Ten champions 
to a young team looking to get 
early-season experience. And 
in that light, while a second-
place finish and the 29th-best 
score in the country leaves a 
lot of room for improvement, 
it 
also 
demonstrates 
the 
Wolverines’ future potential.
“We all need to make a little 
move forward,” Sullivan said. 
“But the guys that are here 
this year are making a nice 
move towards that. So we have 
depth, we’re really young, 
so there’s definitely a big 
foundation that we’re building 
for the future.”

Wolverines beat Irish to remain undefeated

For 
a 
game 
with 
many 
unexpected turns, there was one 
constant in the No. 19 Michigan 
volleyball team’s matchup against 
Notre Dame.
For Michigan, it has been the 
same story all season long. The 
Wolverines have had a perfect 
season, winning nine straight 
games in sweeps before beating 
the Fighting Irish on Friday in 
three straight sets — 25-22, 25-17 
and 25-18 — to add another to 
the streak. The set streak finally 
came to an end on Sunday, but the 
winning streak stayed alive.
Friday’s 
match, 
though 
it 
appeared otherwise, did not come 
easily for Michigan. In fact, to start 
the match, Notre Dame went on a 
11-4 run to push the Wolverines 
into a calling a timeout in an 
attempt to shift the momentum. 
It was evident Michigan was out 
of sync and sloppy, a moment 
of lapse the Fighting Irish took 
advantage of and played to its 
fullest potential.
“(Notre 
Dame) 
touch 
everything with (its) block. They 
served really aggressively, and 
they’re digging,” said Michigan 
coach Mark Rosen. “Our outside 
hitters hit rockets in the first 
couple sets that got dug, and we’re 
just not used to that. So I think a 
little of that put us on our heels, 
and we had to figure that out.”
And just as Michigan was 
figuring out adjustments, Notre 
Dame found a way to match the 
Wolverines’ efforts. The Fighting 
Irish also grew negligent. Careless 
play came from both sides, with 
Michigan seeing the better end 
of many rallies. Two Notre Dame 
service errors, a floater from 
senior outside hitter Carly Skjodt 
and a Skjodt service ace later, 
momentum shifted in favor of the 
Wolverines to bring them within 
four. As the dust settled, it became 
clear who had the better of whom.
The pressure then started 
mounting for both teams, as they 
battled the remainder of the set, 
tooth and nail. Just when Notre 
Dame reclaimed the lead at 21-20, 
however, errors began to plague 
the Fighting Irish just as they had 

earlier to cost them at the most 
inopportune time — though part 
of it was the Michigan stepping up 
its defensive intensity. A service 
and two attack errors gave the 
Wolverines the chance to put the 
set away, and freshman outside 
hitter Paige Jones did just that.
Jones had a clear view of court 
as she hit a line drive straight into 
the center of court, ending the set 
with two quick kills. Jones, as she 
has with every game, answered 
with the composure and patience 
most veterans learn through 
experience. She ended with a 
game-high 13 kills, adding 10 digs 
for her first career double-double.
The patience and cohesiveness 
that pushed Michigan over the 
edge at the end of the first set 
carried over into the second as the 
Wolverines took the second set in 
a similar fashion, but with much 
less of a scare. Instead of being 
down a large deficit.
In part, it was due to the 
adjustments made by junior setter 
Mackenzi Welsh.
Hesitant to do so in the first set, 
Welsh started back-row setting 
in the second that opened the 
offense to more options previously 
blocked off by the Fighting Irish 
front line. By just opening more of 
the offense to becoming a scoring 

threat, the efficiency of the team’s 
attack increased.
While it only had a slight impact 
in the second, the third benefitted 
far more from the potent threat of 
the balanced offense — Michigan’s 
calling card.
“We need balance,” Rosen 
said. “For us, that’s our style of 
our game. And (the Fighting Irish 
are) a team that tries to take your 
balance away, because they serve 
really tough, so if your pass isn’t 
great, and your setter is on the 
run, she now has one option to 
set so that’s what they’re trying to 
do is make you unbalanced. And 
we’re trying to stay balanced, so 
that’s kind of like the battle within 
the battle.”
Just look at the numbers. The 
first set saw a .119 attack average. 
Well 
below 
average 
initially, 
thanks 
to 
Welsh’s 
previous 
expansion of the offense, there 
was a slight increase to .139 the 
second set before. the third saw 
a significant jump to a .441. The 
only jump more significant would 
be Paige Jones’ after she cut to the 
front center and ended the game 
on an emphatic spike.
What made the game tricky 
for the Wolverines wasn’t just 
the talent of their opponents — 
though it was definitely a factor. It 

was also the unique playstyle, one 
that Rosen could only describe as 
“unorthodox.”
“(The Fighting Irish’s) tempo 
is different,” Rosen said. “Trash 
balls, kinda like junk balls, it’s 
very unorthodox, and it can be 
frustrating for blockers because 
there are a lot of balls that you 
can’t block. You do everything 
right and they just junk it over 
the top, and they make your front 
row, opposite front row players 
play a lot of balls, who stand in 
transition, it’s hard for them to 
hit. They clog up your system a lot 
with what they do.”
But the most Notre Dame 
managed was to stagger — not stop 
— Michigan’s balanced offense. 
Key players such as Jones, Skjodt 
and junior outside hitter Sydney 
Wetterstrom couldn’t be stopped 
once they got into a rhythm. The 
team totalled three hitters with 
double-digit kills and four with 
double-digit digs. Welsh, Jones 
and Skjodt posted double-doubles.
“They threw a lot of things at us 
that we’ve never seen before, just 
kind of got us off balance a bit,” 
said senior libero Jenna Lerg. “So 
being all over the floor just calms 
us a little bit knowing that they 
can throw things at us but we’re 
just going to retaliate.”

‘D’ backs Michigan in 
weekend sweep of ND

The score was 17-17 in the first 
set.
After falling behind, 11-4, early 
to Notre Dame at home, the No. 
19 Michigan volleyball team (11-
0) fought all the way back to tie 
the set. Still struggling to find 
any real momentum to pull away 
from the Fighting Irishww, the 
defense saved four spikes before 
finishing the point off with a kill to 
take a lead that they would never 
surrender, en route to yet another 
straight set victory.
The play in the first set 
continued the trend of dominant 
defense that has been the catalyst 
behind the scorching start to the 
season for the Wolverines. Led 
by junior setter Mackenzi Welsh, 
redshirt junior middle blocker 
Cori Crocker up front and senior 
libero Jenna Lerg patrolling the 
back, Michigan has dominated the 
opposition with commanding play 
at all levels.
“We were able to come up with 
some big defensive plays in that 
first set,” said Michigan coach 
Mark Rosen. “Senior outside hitter 
(Carly Skjodt) came up with a 
couple of big digs, (Welsh) made a 
couple of digs and next thing you 
know we’re on a roll.”
The digs did play an integral part 
in the Wolverines’ victory. Lerg, 
Welsh, Crocker and freshman 
outside hitter Paige Jones all 
finished with double-digit digs in 

the match, as Michigan outdug 
Notre Dame 63 to 46. This was the 
first time since 2016 the Wolverines 
had four players record double-
digit digs in the same match.
“Jenna is a stud at libero. She 
pretty much can pick up any ball, 
which is so awesome playing next 
to her,” Skjodt said. “Our block has 
done a great job, which makes it 
easier for our floor defense at the 
back to read around it and pick up 
balls that we wouldn’t have been 
able to pick up otherwise.
The digs offer arguably the 
biggest evidence towards the 
dominance from Michigan this 
season. It has 497 digs on the 
season compared to 385 from its 
opponents. That averages out to 
16.6 digs per set, compared to 12.8 
from its opponents.
“Digging 3-4 consecutive plays 
in a row, it’s great. It really gets the 
crowd going which gets us going,” 
Lerg said. “It really tires out the 
other team because it’s exhausting 
when they keep swinging and keep 
swinging and don’t get anything in 
return. I think it really puts the 
other team at a disadvantage and 
then once we can finish the point, 
it’s really a momentum swing.”
The defense has kept them in 
control of their matches time and 
time again this season. With Big 
Ten conference play starting, that 
continued dominance could be the 
key for the Wolverines to continue 
to climb the national rankings and 
raise the ceiling for what this team 
can accomplish this year.

The arrival of Donovan Peoples-Jones

Fairly or not, much as has been 
expected of Donovan Peoples-
Jones in his short time with the 
Michigan football team. The 
sophomore wide receiver came to 
Ann Arbor nearly two years ago 
as a five-star prospect and the 
highest-ranked member of the 
Wolverines’ 2017 recruiting class.
Despite 
ample 
playing 
opportunity, however, Peoples-
Jones hadn’t played like it. He 
was Michigan’s fourth-leading 
receiver last season and averaged 
just 6.9 yards-per-catch to start 
2018. Though it’s nothing to balk 
at, those numbers don’t exactly 
jump off the page.
But 
Peoples-Jones’ 
performance Saturday did: He 
made four catches for 90 yards 
and found the endzone on all 
three of the Wolverines’ passing 
touchdowns.
“He’s always been a super 
athletic guy, a freak athlete,” 
said redshirt junior tight end 
Zach Gentry. “Credit to him 
taking the next step to learning 
the playbook inside and out and 
perfecting his craft coming out 
of breaks and running his routes. 
He looks comfortable, and he’s 
doing a good job.”
Peoples-Jones 
joined 
Jehu 
Chesson, 
Braylon 
Edwards, 
Devin Funchess, Jeremy Gallon, 
Mario Manningham and David 
Terrell as the only Michigan 
players with three or more 
touchdown receptions in a game 
since 2000.
His first touchdown was a 
gift of the perfect play call. The 
Wolverines 
went 
double-play 
action — first faking to sophomore 
Ambry Thomas on a jet sweep, 
then to junior running back Tru 
Wilson — before Patterson saw 
that SMU had blown its coverage. 
Running a post route, Peoples-
Jones was wide open and made 
no mistake finishing the play, 
racing to find the pylon for a 
35-yard score.
“The post that Donovan ran 

from the slot (was) a terrific 
route,” Harbaugh said. “About 
as much separation you can get, 
really good (throw) by Shea right 
on the money, good protection on 
that one. Just like you drew it up.”
Though he was a decoy, 
Thomas was instrumental in 
the play’s development. After 
receiving his first career carry in 
the opening quarter, Michigan 
ran the same jet sweep action 
to get the Mustangs’ defense 
moving opposite People-Jones.
“(We ran) at least two maybe 
three runs earlier in the game to 
set that play up,” Harbaugh said. 
“It was a well-designed play and 
well executed.”
Peoples-Jones’ 
second 
touchdown, meanwhile, required 
much more skill. From the 
Mustangs’ 
seven 
yard-line, 
Patterson lofted an arching fade 
to Peoples-Jones, who adjusted 
in textbook fashion to corral the 
back-shoulder pass.
“That was a beautiful route, 
great catch and terrific throw,” 
Harbaugh said.
It’s the type of play that shows 
just how talented Patterson is. 

Though he wasn’t as sharp as last 
week — he threw a pick at the 
goal line and should have been 
intercepted earlier in the first 
half — he again made high-level 
throws 
consistently, 
finishing 
14-of-18 for 237 yards.
The longest of those attempts 
naturally went to Peoples-Jones. 
From the Mustangs’ 43-yard line, 
Peoples-Jones ran a go-route and 
simply burned SMU’s safety over 
the top to catch a perfect deep 
ball from Patterson. 
“(Donovan’s) a freak athlete,” 
Patterson said. “He’s very smart, 
very fast, great football size to 
him. I know if I throw it up, 
there’s a lot of trust in him (to 
make the catch).”
Developing chemistry in the 
passing game is the epitome of a 
welcome sign for the Wolverines. 
Their receivers combined for just 
three touchdowns all last season 
— the mark Peoples-Jones met 
Saturday.
Last week, sophomore Nico 
Collins broke Michigan’s 364-day 
stretch without a wide receiver 
touchdown before Peoples-Jones 
caught his first-career score. And 

with Gentry — who made four 
catches for 95 yards Saturday 
— as well as sophomore Oliver 
Martin and fifth-year senior 
Grant Perry also contributing, 
the Wolverines’ passing attack is 
continuing to take shape.
“(Our rapport with Patterson) 
has grown a lot,” Gentry said. “It 
feels good to just spread the ball 
around, make plays in the passing 
game and have some statistics 
there. It’s improved every week 
since camp started.”
Peoples-Jones was nonetheless 
the 
clear 
redzone 
priority 
Saturday. He hasn’t lived up to 
his high school hype just yet, 
but Saturday was a reminder of 
Peoples-Jones’ talent and the 
time he still has to realize his 
potential.
“People forget he’s young,” 
Gentry said. “I remember coming 
in as a freshman, and there’s just 
no way (you can be really good). 
It’s just a whirlwind. I think him 
being so young, you see a big leap 
from the first year to the second 
year and so on.
“Three touchdowns in a day 
isn’t too bad.” 

Metellus finds redemption in pick six 

Josh Metellus has had more 
than a fair share of ups and down 
already in the 2018 season.
Less than six minutes into 
the season opener against Notre 
Dame, the junior safety was 
ejected for a targeting call. His 
replacement, 
Brad 
Hawkins, 
allowed a touchdown on the same 
drive.
But against Western Michigan 
the following week, Metellus 
quietly led the defense with seven 
tackles and 1.5 tackles-for-loss.
If history had a say, Metellus 
was poised for a dip in Saturday’s 
game 
against 
Southern 
Methodist.
And for a moment, with the 
Wolverines leading just 14-7, it 
looked to be the case. On the 
Mustangs’ final drive of the 
second quarter, wide receiver 
James Proche — who finished 
with 11 catches for 166 yard 
and two scores — ran past the 
Michigan 
defense, 
Metellus 
included, for 32 yards to the 
Wolverines’ 24-yard line. Two 
plays later, with his back turned 
away 
from 
the 
quarterback, 
Metellus was called for an ill-

advised pass interference. SMU’s 
drive had the makings of a 
potential game-tying score with 
17 seconds left on the clock.
“I don’t think I held them or 
pass interference or whatever 
they called,” Metellus said. “... 
I was mad for like two seconds 
because I feel like I didn’t do pass 
interference. I just knew I had to 
brush that play off and play the 
next play.”
And in the blink of an eye, 
Metellus’ penalty — one of 13 
on the day for Michigan — was 
forgotten the next play. Metellus 
said he recognized the formation 
from a play run earlier on the 
drive, so he anticipated his 
coverage. Metellus blanketed his 
man along the left sideline, and 
telegraphed 
quarterback 
Ben 
Hicks’ throw, catching it right on 
the numbers.
Memories of Metellus’ Florida 
high school football days — times 
he shared with then-teammates 
Devin Bush and Devin Gil — 
emerged.
“Me, Bush and Gil — we all had 
picks and we all blocked for each 
other,” Metellus said. “Seeing 
(Gil) right in front of me when 
I caught the ball brought back a 
memory of me catching the pick 

and him blocking for me. I see 
him and he’s like ‘come on’ and 
he turned, and I was like ‘I’ve 
gotta score.’ I knew there was 
no time left on the clock because 
before the play I looked up, and it 
said 17 seconds. I knew had to put 
some points on the board.”
Metellus had nothing but 
green and those four blockers in 
front of him. But a straight-line 
sprint looked more like a rabbit 
chase. Hicks’ legs were twisted 
in his downhill pursuit, and with 
Mustang running back Xavier 
Jones catching up, Metellus 
changed course and cut to the 
middle. As he slowed down, 
Metellus made a second inside 
cut past two Mustangs and finally 
lunged towards the end zone just 
before being taken down.
“I liked the route that I took,” 
Metellus said through a smile. “I 
just tried to get in the end zone in 
any way possible.”
Instead of a one-possession 
game against a subpar SMU 
team, 
Michigan 
headed 
to 
the locker room with a two-
possession cushion and every 
ounce of momentum as it headed 
towards a 45-20 victory.
“Our strength coach is big on 
boxing,” Proche said. “He says if 

you take punches in the mouth, 
you bounce right back. We got 
punched 
and 
didn’t 
bounce 
back.”
Metellus’ 
interception 
— 
alongside his five tackles — was 
a bright spot on an otherwise 
unimpressive 
defensive 
performance. 
The 
defense 
collected seven penalties for 
72 yards — 37 of which came 
on one drive that ended in an 
SMU touchdown. It was both 
a testament to the errors the 
defense still must eradicate as 
well as how well the Wolverines 
respond to mistakes.
Metellus is less an exception 
and more of a figurehead to that 
testament. The nature of Don 
Brown’s defense often leaves 
Metellus in isolation, leaving 
it up to him to win one-on-one 
coverage or to spy on a potential 
run or short throw. Some may 
call the role thankless, but it’s 
a give-and-take that Metellus 
acknowledges.
“I feel like I could play at a 
higher level,” Metellus said. “I’ve 
made some good plays so far 
throughout the season. I’ve had 
some plays that I wish I could 
have back. So far, I feel like I 
could take another step to help 
the team out more. Not that I’m 
playing bad, I just feel like I’ve 
got more in me that I could help 
the team win.”
The score was lopsided against 
the Mustangs, but even the 20 
points Michigan allowed seemed 
excessive. The indifference in 
Metellus’ words — “not that I’m 
playing bad” — is recognition of 
the room for improvement. One 
defensive touchdown can’t erase 
the seven defensive penalties.
“You address each of them,” 
said 
coach 
Jim 
Harbaugh. 
“I know some of them were 
penalties. Penalties are hurting 
us, we have to clean up and get 
better at it. … I don’t want 13 
penalties in a game.”
If 
you’re 
Metellus, 
you 
recognize the need to change, 
but admire his unit’s short-term 
memory and resiliency.
It’s 
something 
the 
junior 
safety has refined each season, 
and his pick six is living proof of 
that.

There’s room 
to improve
F

ootball players 
and coaches love 
to remind people 
that there’s always room for 
improve-
ment. The 
Michigan 
football 
team is no 
different, 
and Satur-
day’s game 
was not an 
exception. 
“Really 
look 
forward to a great week of 
practice for the football 
team,” Michigan coach Jim 
Harbaugh said after the Wol-
verines beat SMU, 45-20, on 
Saturday. “We’re getting clos-
er to being good, really good, 
but we’re still not quite there 
yet. See improvements can 
be made. And really looking 
forward to a great week this 
week in preparation.”
In most cases, the senti-
ment of 
Harbaugh’s 
quote is sim-
ply coach 
speak, because 
of course 
every team 
can always 
improve. It 
still probably 
qualifies as 
coach speak 
here, given 
that the question Harbaugh 
was asked was whether or 
not he expects running backs 
Karan Higdon and Chris 
Evans to play next week 
against Nebraska.
But even despite that, and 
despite the Wolverines’ lop-
sided victory, there were mis-
takes, sometimes glaring ones, 
on which Michigan will have 
to improve.
Take, for example, the 
Mustangs’ first touchdown of 
the game. Wolverines safety 
Brad Hawkins and corner-
back David Long had some 
kind of miscommunication, 
and, whatever it was, it left 
SMU receiver James Proche 
running wide 
open up the 
sideline. 
Proche caught 
the pass from 
quarterback 
Ben Hicks and 
scampered 50 
yards to the 
house. Just 
like that, a 
game Michi-
gan should 
have run away with was tied, 
7-7.
And based on the final 
score, you could argue Michi-
gan did run away with it. But 
it was still a game that saw the 
Wolverines commit 13 penal-
ties for 137 yards, including a 
targeting call on junior VIPER 
Khaleke Hudson which will 
hold him out of the first half 
of next week’s game against 
Nebraska.
“You address each of them,” 
Harbaugh said. “… And pen-
alties are hurting us. That’s 
something we have to clean up 

and get better at. We address 
each one — technique, what 
we’re using, the discipline 
that we have. Get them cor-
rected, get them coached, get 
improved. Don’t want 13 pen-
alties in a game. Don’t think 
anybody does.”
And of course, there were 
some mistakes along the 
offensive line throughout the 
night, but hashing through 
those feels like overkill at this 
point.
The thing about all of this 
is that the mistakes, this time, 
didn’t matter, because the 
Wolverines ultimately played 
well enough to win comfort-
ably.
Junior safety Josh Metellus 
prevented the Mustangs 
from scoring before half and 
flipped the whole feel of the 
game on its head with his 
73-yard interception return 
for a touchdown. Junior 
quarterback Shea Patterson 
continued to show exactly 
why his arrival 
was so coveted 
this offseason, 
and sophomore 
wideout Dono-
van Peoples-
Jones proved 
he belongs on 
this stage with 
his three touch-
downs.
The talent 
on Michigan’s 
roster is eye-popping, espe-
cially against the SMUs of the 
world. Perhaps that’s what 
makes the Wolverines’ mental 
mistakes so mind-boggling.
Michigan has time to fix 
many of these errors before 
it gets to the meaty part of 
its schedule, and if it wants 
to reach its preseason goals, 
it needs to. Wisconsin, even 
with its loss to BYU is still a 
team that will gladly make 
them pay for 137 penalty 
yards and blown assignments. 
Michigan State and Penn State 
will too.
Heck, if Nebraska quarter-
back Adrian Martinez returns 
next week, the Cornhuskers 
aren’t a team 
to play around 
with.
The point is 
this: the Wol-
verines got by 
on Saturday 
with some mis-
takes because 
they were 
always going to 
beat the Mus-
tangs. The tal-
ent gap was far too wide.
But there are teams coming 
soon against whom that kind 
of thing won’t fly, and, since 
those games are the ones that 
will define the Wolverines’ 
season, ignoring the gaffes 
would be disingenuous. 
Maybe it feels like nit-
picking, but in this case, it’s 
about more than just room to 
improve.
