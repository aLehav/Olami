Though campus is abuzz 

about the presidential election, 
international students, many of 
whom have never experienced 
the American political process 
firsthand, are bringing a new 
perspective to the contentious 
race.

Noting 
political 
discourse 

among students has been tense at 
times during the election season, 
Business sophomore Jonathan 
Cheng, who is from Hong Kong, 
said he thinks Americans should 
first recognize what a privilege 
it is for them to be able to 
democratically elect their leader.

“I think it is pretty impressive 

for Americans to vote for their 
president,” Cheng said. “Voters 
should treasure this opportunity 
where this is not a certainty for 
people in many other countries.”

Cheng said he decided to 

pursue his college studies in 
the United States, both because 
American 
universities 
are 

consistently 
ranked 
highest 

in the world, and because 
he valued the more relaxed 
learning 
environment 
and 

relationship between professors 
and students.

“The relationship between 

students and faculty are more 
‘equal’ and friendly,” Cheng said. 
“I remembered in my accounting 
class, while a student dropped 
his notes on the floor, the lecturer 

The University of Michigan 

Central Student Government 
launched a new campaign, 
“It Starts With Me,” at an 
event on the Diag Tuesday. 
The initiative aims to bring 
awareness 
to 
racism 
and 

discrimination on campus.

As 
part 
of 
the 
event, 

students were also encouraged 
to submit feedback to the body 
about their initiatives and 
plans this semester.

For 
the 
event, 

representatives 
from 
the 

general assembly, as well as 
CSG commissions, were posted 
near Mason Hall with 600 
donuts, CSG handouts and a 
suggestions board for students 
to write on.

As of Tuesday afternoon, 

the suggestions on the board 
primarily 
centered 
around 

transportation 
to 
North 

Campus, as well as expressions 
of 
solidarity 
for 
minority 

students on campus.

LSA junior Zena Shunnar, 

deputy programming officer 
for CSG, said the event was 
organized in part because 
leaders in the organization 
believe the body needs to be 
more accessible to students. 
Increasing transparency of the 
assembly’s initiatives was part 
of the platform of newMICH, 
the political party led by CSG 
President David Schafer and 
CSG Vice President Micah 

Griggs, LSA seniors.

“I think it’s important to 

show students what we’re 
doing, 
to 
actually 
have 

interaction,” Shunnar said at 
the event. “The main reason 
we chose Diag Day (was) just to 
show face and to not be behind 
a door so much.”

“One trend that I’ve noticed 

is about more frequent buses 
on weekend, like the timing 
of 
buses,” 
Shunnar 
said. 

“And then just, like, a lot of 
people who have been feeling 
discrimination 
on 
campus, 

supporting different causes 
and minorities on campus.”

In the past few months, 

several 
incidents 
targeting 

minority students have sparked 
controversy on campus. In 
September, posters were hung 
in Mason and Haven Halls 
bearing slogans like “denying 
your heritage … be white.” In 

response to the slogans, more 
than 200 students marched 
through campus, chanting “No 
justice, no peace” to express 
solidarity.

By the end of the day, the 

suggestion board was covered 
with more than 300 different 
suggestions, 
ranging 
from 

“No more meatless Monday” 
to “Fight racism,” and CSG 
representatives 
said

Wayne State Prof. Saeed A. Khan speaks at Islamophobia: Politics, Priorities and Prejudice in 2016 at the Hatcher Graduate Library Tuesday.

With the presidential election 

less than a week away, about 
50 people gathered Tuesday at 
Hatcher Graduate Library to 
listen to researchers Saeed Khan 
and Sarrah Buageila discuss data 

on how everyone, but especially 
those 
from 
marginalized 

communities, 
can 
affect 
the 

political process at both the local 
and national level.

The event — Islamophobia: 

Politics, Priorities and Prejudice 
in 2016 — was organized by 
the Institute for Social Policy 
and Understanding, a nonprofit 

founded in 2002 that conducts 
research aimed at empowering 
American Muslims to increase 
community 
involvement 
and 

participation in democracy in the 
United States.

Buageila, the project manager 

for ISPU’s research department, 
began the talk by detailing the 
results of two polls on American 

Muslims. She said the ISPU found 
61 percent of Americans hold 
an unfavorable view of Islam, 
roughly half of all Americans do 
not know a Muslim and 80 percent 
of U.S. media coverage of Islam is 
negative. Furthermore, she said 
only 60 percent of Muslims are 
registered to vote in the United

“When I first moved to the

where things were and what was 
going on, so in my free time, I 
started pulling data and creating 
my own maps to understand 
it,” Hill said. “In that process, 
I was connecting with a lot of

making maps and they were 
creating some great work.”

Monday, Facebook was 

flooded with posts of individuals 

checking in at the Standing Rock 

Reservation in North Dakota, 

including many University of 

Michigan students, to show their 

support of the people protesting a 

proposed pipeline that would go 

through the reservation.

As of Tuesday evening, 

303,547 people had checked in at 

Standing Rock, according to the 

Facebook page, and the Standing 

Rock Indian Reservation page had 

665,319 likes.

Many of the people who were 

checking in at Standing Rock 

were not actually visiting North 

Dakota, and some of the posts 

stated that the large number of 

check-ins aimed to overwhelm and 

confuse police officers in the area. 

A portion of the posts additionally 

suggested the Morton County 

Sheriff’s Department was using 

Facebook check-ins in the area to 

target protesters.

However, in a Facebook post, 

the Morton County Sheriff’s 

Department stated that it was 

not using the check-ins to find 

protesters.

“The Morton County Sheriff’s 

Department is not and does not 

follow Facebook check-ins for the 

protest camp or any location,” the 

post read. “This claim / rumor is 

absolutely false.”

LSA senior Dylan Nelson 

wrote in an email interview that 

at first he did not wish to join the 

many people checking in because 

he believed it did not inspire any 

real change, but later changed 

his mind, citing the importance 

of raising awareness. “I was 

initially very reluctant to check in 

because it seemed to be another 

example of privileged but well 

intentioned liberal undergraduates 

superficially engaging with a 

resistance movement to feel useful 

and accumulate social capital,” 

he wrote. “Then I read a post by 

a friend of mine validating my 

insecurities about appropriating 

the movement’s symbolic power 

but encouraging people to check 

in anyway without, for example, 

a clarifying message that I wasn’t 

actually there.”

In an email interview, LSA 

junior Madison Fyke wrote that, 

regardless of the statement made 

by the Morton County Sheriff’s 

Department, she would rather 

take the extra step than risk the 

potential safety of the protesters.

“In my opinion, we can’t 

ignore the fact that building the 

Dakota Access Pipeline through 

the Standing Rock Indian 

Reservation would compromise 

the Sioux Tribe’s burial and prayer 

sites,” she wrote. “And even if 

the Morton County Sheriff’s 

Department denies that they’re 

following Facebook check-ins at 

the protest camp, it’s important to 

take all precautions to protect the 

protesters when we can’t be there 

to protest ourselves.”

The protests in Standing Rock 

have been going on for months 

in response to the Dakota Access 

Pipeline, a 1,100 mile fracked-

oil pipeline, which is under 

construction. According to the 

#NoDAPL website, the pipeline 

would increase fracking around 

the Bakken shale region and 

endanger a major drinking water 

source for the Standing Rock Sioux 

and 8 million additional people 

living downstream.

Proponents of the pipeline 

argue the new construction would 

provide an economic boost for the 

country and make the U.S. more 

self-sufficient.

Nelson added that the series 

of posts inspired him to research 

the issue more and have a better 

understanding of the protesters 

actions.

“I also know that because of 

the check ins I spent more time 

than I might have otherwise 

getting my facts straight and that I 

now understand more clearly why 

this is something worth getting so 

upset about,” he wrote.

BRIEF: STUDENTS SHOW SUPPORT FOR STANDING ROCK

Following 
the 
discovery 

of 
shallow 
groundwater 

contaminated with the toxic 
compound 
1,4-dioxane 
in 

October, the city of Ann Arbor 
took steps to pursue new legal 
action against the responsible 
party Tuesday night.

City 
Council 
voted 

unanimously during a special 
session to pursue a new legal 
intervention in the state’s 
decades-old 
settlement 

against the original polluter 
during a special session.

The contamination in the 

groundwater is believed to 
have 
originated 
from 
the 

Gelman plume, the result of 
improper wastewater disposal 
by 
the 
Ann 
Arbor-based 

company Gelman. From 1966 
to 1986, the waste created 
a large slow-moving mass 
of carcinogenic water — or 
plume — beneath the city of 
Ann Arbor, as well as Scio 
and Ann Arbor Townships. 
The company has since been 
purchased by Pall Corporation.

The plume, first discovered 

in 1985, has forced the closure 
of more than 100 private 
residential wells and could 
reach the Huron River in the 
coming decades, according to 
county projections. Residents 
have also expressed concerns 
about potential exposure to the 
compound from groundwater 
seepage into basements on the 
city’s west side.

At a community town hall 

held 
last 
week 
regarding 

the 
discovery 
of 
shallow 

contamination, 
Ann 
Arbor 

Mayor Christopher Taylor told 
residents the city intends to 
launch a new legal action to 
achieve standing to negotiate 
with the polluter. Under the 
current consent judgement in 
the 1992 case, only the state 
of Michigan can negotiate 
with Pall Corporation. City 
Council had earlier discussed 
the possibility of pursuing the 
option in a closed-door special 
session earlier last week.

In 2006, Ann Arbor formally 

settled with Pall Corporation 
for $500,000 and lost any 
negotiating rights under the 
state’s original 1992 lawsuit 
and consent judgement against 
Pall Corporation.

In 
an 
interview, 
Taylor 

said if the Washtenaw County 
District 
Court 
accepts 
an 

official motion for intervention 
from the city’s attorney, Ann 

Arbor would have the right 
to directly negotiate with 
Pall Corporation regarding 
cleanup 
and 
pollution 

control, along with the 
Michigan Department of 
Environmental Quality.

“The current court case 

is between the state and 
the polluter; we’re looking 
to have a seat at the 
table,” Taylor said. “We’re 
looking to have a seat at 
the table as the discussion 
moves forward. You can’t 
have a seat at the table; we 
can’t be in the room where 
that conversation occurs if 
we are not a party to the 
case.”

While Taylor said he had 

the support of the MDEQ 
director to take this step, 
specific details of the city’s 
legal strategy still must be 
finalized and the timeline 
for filing a new motion are 
to be determined.

However, 
some 
local 

residents present at the 
special session expressed 
skepticism as to whether 

Concern arises over discovery of shallow contamination in water

Ann Arbor resident Brie Clark, with the nonprofit organization Animal Equality, puts a Virtual Reality viewer on Engineering freshman Dylan Carleton on the 
Diag on Tuesday. 

ANIM AL EQUALIT Y

walked by and picked that up 
for him, and it was like nothing 
special happened; this may seem 
to be usual here, but it was rarely 
seen in some societies.”

He said his parents favor 

Democratic presidential nominee 
Hillary Clinton and often ask 
him about what the supporters 
for both candidates are like.

“People from other countries 

pay a whole lot attention to what 
the U.S. president says, and the 
president’s speech and action can 
fluctuate the global economic 
and political environment a lot,” 
Cheng said. “I think the success 
in this country counts on both a 
great education system and the 
diversity of foreign workers.”

Engineering sophomore Tony 

Li is originally from Beijing, but 
has lived in Calgary, Alberta, 
Canada, since the age of 7. During 
his senior year of high school, he 
said, he decided to take a leap and 
attend school in the United States 
because of the University of 
Michigan’s “stellar” engineering 
program.

“My family moved to Canada 

from China when I was 7, and 
I’ve lived there until I came here 
for university,” Li said. “The 
Canadian schools are OK schools, 
but just not engineering-wise.”

Li said he feels bad for students 

who can vote, most of whom are 
voting in their first presidential 
election.

“It’s not a desirable choice,” 

He said.

Thrust 
into 
the 
political 

atmosphere on campus during 
this year’s presidential primaries 
as a freshman, Li said he was 
especially shocked to see Trump 
emerge 
as 
the 
Republican 

nominee as opposed to someone 
more appealing such as Sen. 
Marco Rubio (R–Fla.) or Ohio 
Gov. John Kasich.

After 
watching 
the 
2015 

Canadian 
federal 
elections, 

Li said, he expected a more 
moderate 
candidate 
than 

Trump to emerge, similar to the 
newly elected Canadian Prime 
Minister Justin Trudeau of the 
Liberal Party or former Prime 
Minister Stephen Harper of the 
Conservative Party.

He said he initially wanted 

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I–Vt.) to win 
because he generally agrees with 
Sander’s 
democratic 
socialist 

policies since they are similar to 
the Canadian political system, 
but added he felt Sanders never 
really had a chance.

“I definitely care who wins, 

I’m here (in America) quite a bit,” 
he joked.

When he goes back home to 

Canada for breaks, he said, his 
friends will often poke fun at 
the U.S. presidential election; 
however, they intently keep up to 
date with the race.

“They’re still following the 

politics,” Li said. “America is a 
superpower and people do care 
about who’s going to lead and 
have that supreme power.”

Li added that he senses 

political tension among students 
on campus, particularly when 
he sees people having polarized 
political arguments.

“They all bring in their 

personal viewpoints, but I don’t 
think they’re taking anything 
from the other side,” Li said.

While he is interested in the 

outcome, Li said he probably 
won’t bother to watch the 
election results live.

“It’s pretty much decided from 

the polls; Trump does not have 
a chance,” Li said. “I’ll definitely 
check online once in a while that 
evening.”

While Li and Cheng are 

experiencing the presidential 
election up close as a byproduct 
of attending college in the United 
States, Jori Korpershoek, said he 
is currently studying abroad at 
the University semester partially 
because he wanted to experience 
the 
U.S. 
election 
firsthand. 

Korpershoek 
attends 
Leiden 

University College in The Hague, 
Netherlands.

He said he wants to have a 

greater understanding of why 
there is a surge of the alternative 
right-wing movement happening 
in 
the 
United 
States 
with 

Trump’s nomination, especially 
considering that candidates in 
the past, like 2012 GOP nominee 
Mitt Romney have been more 
moderate.

“If you have a two-party 

system, 
you 
would 
expect 

the candidates presented to 
the people to be relatively 
mainstream,” Korpershoek said. 
“I didn’t think Trump would win 
the primary.”

Korpershoek said he finds 

conservative 
philosophy 

intriguing, but added that he 
doesn’t think Trump embodies 
those principles.

“I think there’s something 

admirable 
about 
pure 

conservatism 
and 
I 
think 

Trump has very few of those 
qualities,” Korpershoek said. 
“I think what I’ve been trying 
to understand is, on the one 
hand, trying to sympathize 
with people who are voting for 
politicians like Trump, while at 
the same time also trying to find 
that balance between economic 
anxiety or if everybody is just 
like racist.”

Currently, Korpershoek said 

people in the Netherlands are 
talking more about the U.S. 
election than the forthcoming 
Dutch election in 2017.

“It’s pretty intriguing how 

there’s 
a 
relatively 
sizable 

percentage 
of 
people 
who 

follow the American election 
intensely,” Korpershoek said. “I 
couldn’t recognize other German 
politicians, for example, but I 
could tell you who Marco Rubio 
is and what John McCain looks 
like.”

For the most part, Korpershoek 

said he doesn’t sense a lot of 
tension on campus, but rather 
a general nervousness on both 
sides of the political spectrum.

“I kind of expected things to 

be tense, but I feel more of an 
apathy in most people I meet, 
rather than anger,” Korpershoek 
said.

States — compared to 94 percent 
of Protestants.

She told the crowd she hopes 

these numbers bring light to 
issues with voter registration 
and negative perceptions and 
spark more involvement from the 
Muslim community.

“We don’t want to do research 

just for the sake of doing 
research, we want to do research 
that empowers the community,” 
Buageila said.

In her remarks, she focused on 

how to increase voter turnout in 
not only the Muslim American 
community, 
but 
also 
in 
all 

minority communities. Noting 
Islamophobia and the erosion of 
civil liberties is a main concern 
for Muslims, she emphasized 
that this should be a concern 
for all Americans, calling it an 
extension of the United States’ 
legacy of slavery and imperialism.

Buageila 
concentrated 
on 

increasing 
Muslim-American 

civil participation particularly 

through short-term strategies, 
long-term strategies and “Get 
Out and Vote” tactics. In practice, 
these strategies include educating 
the 
Muslim 
community, 

volunteering to work at the polls 
on Election Day and increasing 
mosque 
attendance. 
Despite 

some negative perceptions of 
mosques, Buageila said polls 
show 
that 
frequent 
mosque 

attendance is linked to greater 
civic engagement.

Khan, 
a 
lecturer 
in 
the 

department of Near East and 
Asian Studies at Wayne State 
University, 
continued 
the 

conversation 
by 
connecting 

Islamophobia 
to 
other 
anti-

progressive campaigns during 
American demographic shifts.

He 
said 
rapidly 
shifting 

demographics in the U.S., like the 
first year with a non-Protestant 
religious majority in 2010, has led 
to an unprecedented moral panic 
regarding the direction of the 
country.

Although 
the 
religious 

majority has changed, Khan also 
acknowledged the prominence of 
Islamophobia and questioned the 
real root of its increase, saying 

it does not solely come from the 
federal level.

“Washington has proven to 

be paradoxically fairly impotent 
when it comes to fairly moving 
the needle on anything,” Khan 
said.

To instead locate the source 

of Islamophobia at the local 
level, Khan researched six topics 
of 
law: 
voter 
identification, 

immigration, 
abortion 
rights, 

same-sex marriage, right to work 
and anti-Sharia law.

Through this research, he said 

he found restrictive legislation 
is overwhelmingly driven by 
Republicans, though only 13 
percent 
of 
total 
Republican 

lawmakers in the country work 
to pass such legislation. Khan 
said 80 percent of this small 
group 
supports 
voter-access 

laws, adding they display a desire 
to disenfranchise and restrict 
people from their rights as 
Americans to engage in civil and 
political matters.

Based on his findings, Khan 

said it is important for Muslims 
to increase their self-awareness 
and education on these areas 
of law, as well as to take part 

in more political engagement. 
For the broader community, 
Khan urged people to develop 
a contextual understanding of 
the Muslim community, as well 
as identify and integrate how 
wider 
legislative 
and 
policy 

concerns will impact the Muslim 
community.

“It is all connected, it is all 

related, it is all integrated,” Khan 
said.

LSA sophomore Mary Najjar, 

who attended the event for her 
Arab-American studies class, and 
said she thought many Muslim 
Americans feel conflicted about 
their political participation.

“I 
thought 
that 
it 
was 

interesting, I guess you almost 
kind of understand it, but, like, 
the Muslim community thought 
that there wasn’t anyone there to 
represent them so there was no 
point in voting because nobody 
is there for their interest,” Najjar 
said. “It is kind of a paradox 
where you have to vote to get 
their attention so they focus 
more on your issues, but also 
if they’re not focusing on your 
issues you wouldn’t want to get 
involved.”

“If 
you’re

successful in life, those 
resources should go back 
to society,” Lipsey said in a 
video interview at the Daily

institution that educated 
you and allowed you to 
mature deserves support

After graduating from

Lipsey

during the Korean War 
as editor of the Offutt, a 
Nebraska-based newspaper 
Air Pulse at Strategic Air 

Command Headquarters.

He 
then 
joined 
the 

weekly Sun Newspapers in 
his hometown of Omaha in 
1953, where he eventually 
became 
the 
paper’s 

publisher and owner. In 
1969, Lipsey sold the paper 
to Warren Buffett, but 
continued 
as 
publisher. 

During his tenure at Sun 
Newspapers, the paper won 
a Pulitzer Prize for local 
investigative reporting in 
1973. 

In 1983, Lipsey became 

publisher of The Buffalo 
News in New York at the 
request of Buffett, who 
also owned the paper. He 
remained in that position 
until his retirement in 
2012.

Lipsey is survived by 

his wife, Judith; daughter, 
Janet; son, Daniel; and two

the city’s strategy would be

Vince Caruso, a founding

county-wide

combat the plume Allen’s Creek 
Watershed Group, said he is not 
confident the MDEQ will be 
able to adequately control the

believed the only way forward 
would be to petition for an

federal intervention.

“I think we have good 

evidence the DEQ is not up to 
this effort,” Caruso said. “I 
think we need to move and I 
think the EPA has technology, 
they have scientists, they have 
large numbers of staff that 
can come in, they have the

will go after the responsible

viewed the day as a success.

CSG 
Communications 

Director Joe Shea, a Public 
Policy 
senior, 
echoed 

Shunnar, 
saying 
it 
was 

important for students to 
know what their elected 
officials are working on.

“We’re 
very 
passionate 

about making sure we are 
a resource for students, so 
the best way to do that is 
solicit feedback by any way 
possible,” he said.

The organization’s goal, 

Shunnar said, was to have 
students fill the board of 
suggestions 
with 
their 

opinions 
on 
recent 
CSG 

initiatives and future events 
they would like to see hosted 
by the assembly.

“If 
that 
board 
of 

suggestions gets filled and 
we’re able to see something 
consistent on that board, that 
will help us progress and do 
something students really 
want,” Shunnar said.

LSA freshman Brittany 

Jullie, 
who 
signed 
the 

banner, said she was glad to 
see the initiative.

“I think it’s a really good 

idea that people can raise 
suggestions with what they 
want to see happen,” she 
said.

Shunnar noted that the 

board also made it clear 
students weren’t completely 
familiar 
with 
assembly 

initiatives, 
because 
many 

students expressed concerns 
about problems the body is 
already working to fix.

“It’s nice that we’re able to 

be a little more transparent 
with 
what 
things 
we’re 

doing, because it’s different 
to send out an email than to 
talk to students,” Shunnar 
said. “We’re getting a lot of 
kids.”

She said she hopes to host 

another event similar to 
Diag Day, perhaps in another 
location, in the future.

“I think we may have 

one on North Campus, so 
just to change the scenery, 
obviously just getting a lot of 
student impact is important,” 
she said.

Eagle Scout, he said he was 
curious about understanding his 
surroundings through his map-
making skills.

“I think it’s definitely the boy-

scout effect,” he said. “I did a lot 
with maps and compasses as a 
kid, so as part of that I’ve really 
always enjoyed looking at maps 
to understand what was going 
on.”

Hill and his collaborators use 

open-source data, information 
that is freely available to the 
public, to create their maps. 
They combine different aspects 
of raw data to create intricate 
visualizations 
of 
certain 

phenomena. 
Some 
examples 

include “Detroit’s Digital Divide,” 
“Liquor, Parks and Homicide,” 
and 
“Detroit 
Neighborhood 

Coffee Shop Density.”

“A 
lot 
of 
the 
ideas 
for 

maps come from community 
conversations where people will 
have questions about something, 
and I’ll make a map for it,” 
Hill said. “I follow a lot of the 
conversations in urban planning 
and public health within the 
city, so I look for how research 
and data from other cities can be 
applied to Detroit.”

LSA senior Kyle Monagle, 

one of the approximately 30 
students in attendance for Hill’s 
presentation, said he was there to 
satisfy a requirement for a class 

in the Department of American 
Culture.

“We’ve been talking a lot about 

gentrification 
and 
pertinent 

problems the city is dealing 
with,” 
Monagle 
said. 
“I’m 

planning on living and working 
in Detroit after graduation, so I 
want to learn more about the city, 
which is why this talk sounded 
really interesting to me.”

In his presentation, “Giving 

Data Empathy,” Hill discussed 
the different ways maps make 
sense of social, political and 
economic phenomena. He noted, 
however, that statistics without 
context aren’t going to motivate 
lawmakers, voters or residents to 
enact change.

Hill said he believes it is 

necessary to help consumers 
relate to data on a more personal 
level. Through Detroitography, 
he hopes to empower Detroiters 
by giving them the tools to 
understand and tell the story of 
their neighborhoods themselves.

He noted that as part of the 

project, he organizes mapping 
workshops 
in 
libraries 
and 

community 
centers 
to 
help 

Detroit residents improve their 
data literacy, saying he believes 
the repair and preservation of 
any city must be grounded in the 
people living there.

“I am always looking for ways 

to collaborate with other people 
in the area,” Hill said. “For me, 
this project made sense because it 
is a way to keep the conversations 
about change in the city going.”

F

acing worsening polls, 
Donald 
Trump 
has 

brought the issue of 

voter fraud to the forefront of 
American 
political 

debate. 
He 
claims 

that because of voter 
fraud, the election is 
being rigged against 
him. It’s important 
to note where these 
claims come from; 
Trump is advocating 
for voter ID laws, a 
legislative 
monster 

that the Republican 
Party 
has 
been 

building up for years.

While Trump tries to frame 

the issue as protecting our 
democracy, we need to be 
aware of the facts. Voter ID 
laws are intended to prevent 
voter impersonation on Election 
Day, but, as I will prove, voter 
impersonation (showing up to 
the polls and pretending to be 
someone else) is non-existent. 
Under false claims, the issue 
of voter ID laws has become 
political. 
What’s 
really 
at 

stake with voter ID laws is the 
right to vote, which is an issue 
that should not be politicized. 
These laws already exist in 
20 percent of states. Voter ID 
laws 
are 
ineffective, 
could 

disenfranchise more than 21 
million Americans and must go.

The problem of voter fraud 

isn’t the issue it’s made out to 
be. Donald Trump correctly 
states that 1.8 million deceased 
people 
are 
still 
registered 

to vote, but that in no way 
indicates that voter fraud is 
being 
undertaken 
on 
their 

behalf. The much publicized 
South Carolina voting fraud 
case of dead people voting 
was investigated by the State 
Law 
Enforcement 
Division, 

and in an election with more 
than 1.3 million votes, just 
five possible, unaccounted-for 
“zombie” votes were found. 
Trump claims that 14 percent 
of non-citizens are registered 
to vote, but according to the 
managers 
of 
the 
database 

who accumulated the data 
he’s basing that on, “the likely 
percent of non-citizen voters in 
recent US elections is 0.”

In Florida, there are more 

instances 
of 
shark 
attacks 

than there are of voter fraud 
cases with sufficient evidence 
to investigate, according to 
Politifact. 
A 
comprehensive 

report 
published 
in 
The 

Washington Post found just 
31 potential incidents of voter 
fraud out of one billion votes 

cast, dating back to 2008. The 
number of Americans killed by 
lightning from 2000 to 2010? 
It’s numbered at 441, which is 

11 times the amount 
of potential voter 
fraud cases.

A research group 

from 
Arizona 

State 
University 

investigated 
2,068 
election-

fraud cases dating 
back to 2000 and 
concluded 
that 

while 
fraud 
has 

occurred, the rate 
is infinitesimal, and 

in-person voter impersonation 
on 
Election 
Day, 
which 

prompted 37 state legislatures 
to enact or consider tough 
voter ID laws, is virtually non-
existent. 

Let’s 
break 
down 
what 

we’re 
talking 
about: 
Voter 

impersonation exists on such 
an “infinitesimal” level that 
there is “virtually no voter 
impersonation 
fraud.” 
That 

is what all the data indicates 
over the past decade. However, 
to 
stop 
this 
non-existent 

problem, we have potentially 
disenfranchised up to 21 million 
Americans, roughly 11 percent 
of our country, which is the 
number of Americans without 
a valid voter ID who would be 
prevented from voting.

So why, you ask, do we have 

these laws at all? You might 
not be shocked at the answer 
— it’s political. Ninety-three 
percent of Blacks voted for 
the Democratic Party in the 
2012 election. There is an 
unmistakable trend that these 
laws are intended to suppress, 
in 
particular, 
votes 
from 

minorities. If you’re doubtful, 
look at the trends. Twenty-five 
percent of African Americans 
do not have the necessary voter 
ID that some states require, 
while only 8 percent of white 
Americans do not. The U.S. 
Court of Appeals ruled that the 
North Carolina voter ID law 
was unconstitutional, saying 
that the provisions “target 
African Americans with almost 
surgical precision.” What led 
them to such a conclusion? 
North 
Carolina 
lawmakers 

actually requested data on how 
race affected voting behaviors. 
According to the lawmakers, 
“with race data in hand, the 
legislature amended the bill to 
exclude many of the alternative 
photo IDs used by African 
Americans. The bill retained 
only the kinds of IDs that white 

North Carolinians were more 
likely to possess.”

In 
that 
race 
data 
was 

also research that indicated 
African 
Americans 
were 

more likely to use same-day 
registration 
and 
the 
early 

voting period. With this data 
in 
hand, 
North 
Carolina’s 

legislature eliminated same-
day registration and cut the 
early 
voting 
period 
nearly 

in 
half. 
Most 
damagingly, 

the judges wrote that this 
“comes as close to a smoking 
gun as we are likely to see in 
modern times, the State’s very 
justification for a challenged 
statute hinges explicitly on 
race.” This is a court, not a 
partisan think tank. Courts 
around the country have slowly 
started to rule these voter ID 
laws unconstitutional in that 
they target minority voters.

To 
further 
prove 
the 

politicized nature of the issue, 
feel free to juxtapose the most 
conservative states with those 
with the strictest voter ID laws. 
There’s another clear trend: In 
general, the more Republican 
the state, the harsher the voter 
ID laws. The GOP platform 
actually argues for stricter 
voter ID laws, even though 
a federal appeals court has 
ruled them unconstitutional. 
Combined 
with 
felony 

disenfranchisement, 
which 

by itself disenfranchises 13 
percent of the Black population 
in 
the 
United 
States, 
an 

absolutely staggering number, 
voter ID laws are intended to 
build upon laws that already 
suppress 
minority 
voting. 

There is no doubt that voter 
suppression of minorities is a 
politically charged action.

Democrats and Republicans 

both go out of their way to 
politicize what should not be 
politicized. This is just another 
example, but it’s crucial to 
promoting 
real 
democracy. 

Nearly 11 percent of the country 
does not have proper voter ID 
— to disenfranchise all those 
people for political reasons is 
undemocratic. In the face of 
voter fraud rhetoric, we can’t 
lose sight of the big picture and 
get steamrolled. We need to be 
finding ways to increase voter 
turnout, not depress it. On the 
principles of our democracy, 
we must reduce voter ID laws, 
and our rhetoric around it 
must change.

Voter suppresion is the real threat

Let’s deconstruct celebrity

ISAIAH ZEAVIN-MOSS | COLUMN

alking 
into 
The 

Loving 
Touch 
in 

Ferndale on a cold, 

dreary Thursday night, I was 
surprised to see, standing right in 
front of me, the artist 
whom I had come to 
watch. Greta Kline, 
the lead singer of 
Frankie Cosmos — one 
of my favorite bands 
— was selling her 
group’s merchandise, 
standing 
behind 
a 

propped-up table. No 
security in sight, no 
intra-crowd shoving 
or 
cursing 
to 
get 

Kline’s attention. She 
stood there, engaging 
with her fans, and we responded 
with equal calmness.

I 
found 
this 
experience 

surprising 
for 
many 
reasons. 

Principally, I find that we as a 
culture endow celebrities and 
artists whom we admire with 
certain divine attributes. We 
shake their hands and then do not 
wash that hand, as if the artist’s 
talent might literally rub off onto 
us. We configure lives for them, 
somewhat based on their music, 
but mostly upon our projections 
and fascinations and imaginations.

And I do not mean to distinguish 

myself from this culture of 
fanaticism. Last month, after 
seeing Bernie Sanders speak at 
UMMA, I felt viscerally saddened 
when I could not shake his hand. 
He was quickly swept behind a 
curtain by a big, burly security 
guard, and he was gone — whisked 
away and thrown back into the 
confines of my mind, where I can 
project fantasies and ideas about 
Sanders the celebrity, ignoring 
Sanders the human.

But Kline’s warm welcoming 

of her fans seemed to blur this 
very distinction between the 
celebrity and her fans. Instead, if 
only for a moment, she became 

one of us. Dressed in an oversized 
striped shirt, blue jeans and a 
simple baseball cap, Ms. Kline 
interacted seamlessly with the 
dozens of people asking for 

photographs. Many of 
these fans stood and 
stared in disbelief at 
Kline’s 
unequivocal 

generosity 
and 

welcoming attitude.

Immediately upon 

entering the space, I 
came up to her and 
asked if she would be 
in a photograph with 
me. 
She 
accepted, 

and turned to me 
— admittedly, I was 
sweating 
(I 
sweat 

more than anyone I’ve ever met, 
outside of my brother (and this is 
something we bond over a lot and 
he’s coming this weekend so if you 
see me feel free to empathize or to 
check in with us about our surely 
sweaty armpits and backs and 
faces (and do you feel the effect 
that this anecdote about my sweat 
had on you? You now feel like you 
know an additional element of me, 
the writer, Isaiah (Hi, I’m Isaiah), 
because I shared it with you, I 
said, “Hey, I can actually share 
more than I normally do because 
I trust my reader not to call me 
out. I trust that I can be a little bit 
vulnerable and playful with my 
reader. That’s what I think was at 
the core of Kline’s open welcome 
to her fans)))). I struck a pose — 
and, without a hesitation, Ms. 
Kline stuck her tongue out and her 
hands up as if we were best friends 
— and, in that moment, I felt like 
we could have been! She was right 
there with me, in that moment, 
equally embracing our shared 
sense of silliness and playfulness.

Eventually, the show began. 

Having seen Kline in this casual, 
playful context made me feel so 
much closer to her music, which 
deals explicitly with the narrator’s 

self-consciousness and anxiety. 
There was no longer any alienation 
between myself and the words 
and sentiments in the songs. This 
could be about me, this could be 
about any of my friends whom 
I’m dancing with, about any of my 
friends from home.

I think there’s a lesson to be 

learned from this experience: 
By fantasizing and imagining 
lives for celebrities, we do not, in 
fact, get closer to them. Instead, 
the conclusions at which we 
arrive have their footing in other 
assumptions 
that 
we 
make. 

And I’m not saying this sort of 
fanaticism is inherently wrong. 
Not at all. As I said, I engage in 
it — it’s fun to narrativize and 
to make characters of real-life 
human beings.

But I think if our goal is 

transparency — if our goal is to 
actually understand artists or 
celebrities for who they are — then 
we ought to try to break down the 
social barriers between fans and 
their idols, between public figures 
and their followers. We ought 
to have be able to interact with 
them in less strictly constructed 
settings, where they will not shy 
away from engaging with those 
who have flocked to witness them. 
Because in this kind of a space — 
one in which people engage freely 
and set aside the cultural currency 
attached to their bodies, we get a 
little bit closer to one another.

It takes courage. It takes both 

parties trusting each other not to 
humiliate or taunt. This is how 
we should regard one another by 
default. Just like I believe you, 
the reader, to be decent enough 
to know that I sweat, horribly, 
humiliatingly, 
disgustingly 

without criticizing me. My body 
gets exorbitantly wet. It does! And 
that’s OK.

racist 

once people decide 
it is. Rather than 
asking 
whether 

something is racist, 
it’s more productive 
to discuss whether 
or not people find 
it racist.

If you had to guess how many 

Native Americans are bothered 
by the name of the Washington 
Redskins, what would you say? 
Fifty 
percent? 
Seventy-five 

percent? This issue has been at 
the forefront of conversations 
about social justice for years, 
so it’s only logical to conclude 
that this bothers a significant 
portion of the Native American 
community. A recent survey found 
that 9 percent of Native Americans 
polled find the name offensive. 
This isn’t an argument that the 
name is appropriate. If very few 
Native Americans actually take 
pride in the name, I don’t think 
there are many (if any) compelling 
reasons to keep it. But, this piece of 
data goes to show how fickle our 
perception of racism is.

In other policy domains, we can 

see similar ways in which we’ve 
essentialized the views of people of 
color. Consider this recent pair of 
surveys about racism in the United 
States. In one conducted by CNN, 
17 percent of Blacks polled viewed 
the Confederate flag as a symbol of 
Southern pride. In another by Pew, 
36 percent of Blacks surveyed had 
a “great deal” or “fair amount” of 
confidence that local police treat 
Blacks and whites equally. Neither 
of these numbers is particularly 
high, but they were both much 
higher than I’d been led to believe 
by leftist discourse.

Let’s be clear: Police brutality 

is a serious issue — no two ways 
about it. In that same Pew survey, 
just 0.6 percent of Blacks expected 
the police to use an appropriate 
amount of force in a given scenario. 
In regards to the Confederate flag, 
73 percent of Blacks in the sample 
said that it should be taken down 
from 
government 
buildings. 

Clearly, these are both pressing 
issues that deserve action, but 
it’s important not to create a one-
dimensional Black perspective to 
advance social justice causes.

This sort of measured 

stance 
is 
good 
for 

discourse, but bad for 
advocacy. 
Can 
you 

imagine 
the 
NAACP 

saying that they speak 
for 47.543259 (to use 
an 
arbitrary 
number) 

percent 
of 
Black 

people? It would be a 
catastrophe. They would 
lose credibility in the 
public 
sphere. 
These 

well-intentioned 
and 

often effective groups — 

whose efforts I agree with — seek 
to institutionalize a limited version 
of truth to suit their agenda.

A large part of an institution’s 

power lies in its ability to convince 
people that it best represents the 
truth. To better understand the 
relationship between truth and 
power, it’s helpful to borrow from 
Foucault’s theory of “regime of 
truth.” To quickly reduce his 
writing: What we conceive as 
truth isn’t absolute; it’s influenced 
politically and has an agenda. The 
struggle for power in the public 
sphere is based upon claiming 
heir to truth. This isn’t to make 
an argument that all truth is 
totally relative, subjective and 
individuated. It is possible to 
create a universal theory; however, 
we should not expect this to 
come from our political arena. 
As I previously discussed, groups 
focused on political actions are less 
concerned with representing the 
whole truth than with convincing 
the masses and policy makers that 
their version of truth is correct. 
Rather, we can use the arts as a 
lens to construct these coherent, 
comprehensive worldviews.

The television show “Atlanta” 

is a good example of how art 
can bolster our discourse. The 
show has a clear political bent; 
Donald Glover’s character often 
acts as a proxy for the show’s 
liberal audience. Additionally, it 
has other aesthetic goals beyond 
representation, such as humor 
and drama. However, the show 
does a lot of important work, 
like not breaking police brutality 
down into a simplistic Black-
white binary. Early in the series, 
Paperboy, an aspiring rapper, is 
leaving jail when a Black police 
officer recognizes him and asks 
for a photo. The officer poses with 

Paperboy by holding his fingers 
together in the shape of a gun; 
the rapper is clearly nonplussed 
by the officer’s lack of sensitivity. 
As the two talk, the police officer 
gleefully reveals that he arrested 
famed Atlanta rapper Gucci Mane 
and doesn’t connect the dots 
between Gucci and Paperboy’s 
similar plights.

In this short scene, “Atlanta” 

demonstrates how people of color 
are incorporated into systems 
of oppression, which is an 
important nuance often left out of 
discourse about police brutality. 
I 
recall 
some 
conservative 

commentators 
claiming 
that 

race could not have played a role 
in Freddie Gray’s murder due to 
the fact some of the cops were 
Black. This demonstrates just 
one deleterious effect of leaving 
out important nuances like these 
in our public conversation.

Similarly, the show doesn’t 

shy away from presenting how 
prejudices, such as sexism and 
homophobia, exist within the 
Black community. These problems 
exist in all communities, but they 
morph depending upon their 
social context. It’s important to 
recognize that “Atlanta” is about 
Atlanta and tells a specific story 
that is underpinned by geographic, 
cultural 
and 
socioeconomic 

locations. Thus, we shouldn’t use it 
as a synecdoche for Black America. 
At the end of the day, this show 
is a single data point, but it does 
add important nuances to our 
conversation and is accessible to a 
wide audience in a way that other 
discursive modes aren’t.

Discussions of race are often 

based around the truth proffered 
by civil rights groups, which are 
extremely important, but don’t 
represent the entire truth. They’ll 
occlude facts and perspective that 
don’t advance their goals. This 
is true in all realms of policy. We 
can’t fully understand the effects 
of NAFTA solely by looking at 
employment statistics. We need 
to understand people’s narratives 
and communities’ responses to 
increasing globalization. If we 
want to have a full conversation 
about the issues in our world, 
we can’t rely on purely political 
sources of truth. Art like “Atlanta” 
isn’t the only way to end the 
discursive essentialism, nor is it 
necessarily the best way, but it 
provides an important first step.

It’s kilt season.
Guest’s ‘Mascot’ lacks 
luster of his prior films 

Mockumentary focused on mascot competition silly, but overkill

FILM REVIEW

A few months ago, GQ ran 

a health-focused profile of Bill 
Clinton. The former president 
was but a sliver 
of his former self, 
the color drained 
from his lips and 
his 
southern 

grit 
and 
charm 

absent 
from 
his 

defenses of liberal 
politics. 
Quietly 

devastating, 
the 

profile painted a 
portrait of greatness (scandals 
aside, President Clinton was 
indisputably 
a 
phenomenal 

politician) in decline.

Similar words could be written 

about Christopher Guest, the 
king 
of 
mockumentaries. 
A 

starring role in Rob Reiner’s 
“This Is Spinal Tap,” about a 
British hard rock band in decline, 
led to a brief stint on “Saturday 
Night Live “and then a string 
of phenomenal improvisational 
mockumentaries, “Waiting for 
Guffman,” “Best in Show,” “A 
Mighty Wind” and “For Your 
Consideration.” 
These 
films, 

planned but unscripted, brilliantly 
pick apart inane, niche worlds 
ripe for comedic emasculation: 
Small-town community theater? 
Dog shows? Folk music? Oscars 
fanaticism? Nothing is off limits 
for Guest and his repertory 
company 
of 
improvisational 

actors, who inhabit quirky roles 
with a deftness that defies human 
comprehension.

Guest, who would star in his 

films 
alongside 
the 
brilliant 

likes of Jane Lynch (“Talladega 
Nights”), 
Catherine 
O’Hara 

(“Home Alone”), Eugene Levy 
(“Finding Dory”) and so many 
others, showed just as much 
brilliance in front of the camera 
as behind it. But in “Mascots,” his 
return to filmmaking after a ten-

year hiatus (albeit interrupted by 
a TV show, “Family Tree,” and a 
wonderful segment at the 2012 
Oscars), Guest is only a remnant 
of his former self, color faded from 
his face like the former president. 
Reserving himself to a small 

role, and lacking 
O’Hara and Levy, 
his two greatest 
stars, Guest’s latest 
project resembles 
more an off-kilter 
impression 
of 

himself 
than 
a 

further 
addition 

to his impressive 
oeuvre.

Perhaps that’s because the 

subject of the film — a mascot 
competition — feels like a rehash 
of “Best in Show,” which focused 
on a dog show competition. 
Quirky characters from around 
the 
world, 
dedicated 
to 
a 

pointless competitive activity, 
are introduced one by one and 
descend on the host city, mix 
and mingle and then compete 
(with a number of setbacks) until 
a winner is named. But it’s not 
just the context that feels overly 
familiar; so many of the specific 
events and character types that 
feature in “Best in Show” return 
in “Mascots,” which renders 
the 
film 
utterly 
predictable, 

especially if one has seen “Best 
in Show” countless times like me. 
Even the opening scene — a couple 
in the competition bickering with 
each other in a Shakespearean 
depiction of ill fate — is directly 
copied. It’s unfortunate because 
Guest’s 
films 
revel 
in 
their 

imagination 
and 
creativity. 

Predictability ought to be an 
anathema, rather than a defining 
feature of a Guest film.

Perhaps it’s also the strong 

sense of removal the film can’t 
help but evoke. Netflix is a great 
platform for experimentation, but 
its penchant for expressive color 
palettes (think the bright pinks 
and yellows in “Unbreakable 

Kimmy Schmidt” or the intensely 
faded colors in “House of Cards”) 
gives “Mascots” a sheen of artifice 
that ruins its lived-in world. 
Mascotery, as the characters call 
it, isn’t nearly present enough 
as a competitive field in pop 
culture for us to really laugh. 
Dogs aren’t particularly silly in 
and of themselves, but dog shows 
are rather ludicrous. The Oscars 
aren’t inherently ripe for humor, 
but the pageantry surrounding 
the desire to be nominated for 
one is. I had thought that mascot 
competitions were an invention 
of 
Guest 
(Google 
corrected 

me — they are in fact real), but 
mascots themselves are a rather 
funny concept. The added layer 
of a competition seemed to be 
overkill.

That’s not to say the film isn’t 

worth watching. Anytime Guest’s 
regulars are assembled on screen, 
hilarity ensues. I lost it when 
Jennifer 
Coolidge 
(“Legally 

Blonde”) 
and 
Bob 
Balaban 

(“Moonrise Kingdom”) appeared 
as 
a 
wealthy, 
disinterested 

couple. Parker Posey (“Dazed and 
Confused”) and Ed Begley Jr. (“St. 
Elsewhere”) are funny as ever. 
Fred Willard’s (“Anchorman”) 
appearance 
and 
troublingly 

funny aloofness on any screen is 
cause for celebration. And while 
Guest’s younger generation of 
new collaborators don’t quite 
rise to their predecessors’ level, 
they still add blissfully funny 
moments.

“Mascots” isn’t so much a 

failure as it is a disappointment. 
Each laugh amplified the silences 
in between, of which there 
were far too many, when the 
awkwardness between characters 
simply proved too artificial, too 
phony or too familiar. Guest’s 
model is perhaps unsustainable 
— luck no doubt plays a role in 
encountering terrains well suited 
for comedic deep dives — but I 
never expected Guest’s fortune to 
run out.

LIL WAYNE

“Smell my armpit!”

Celebrity culture and its inter-

textuality have always caused 
tension in hip hop, a genre found-
ed on authentic-
ity. Famous people 
strive to control 
their public per-
ceptions by pre-
senting themselves 
through 
care-

fully crafted, often 
glamorous lenses, 
but rappers have 
traditionally been 
expected to por-
tray themselves unashamedly. At 
the art form’s inception, cyphers 
occurred on street corners, and 
lyrics 
represented 
livelihoods. 

Fibs were pounced on. Word was 
bond.

By the 2000s, hip hop had 

exploded into the mainstream and 
its fanbase evolved into a reliable 
market. Clothing labels, movies 
and TV shows emerged, all repre-
sented by rappers, the 21st-centu-
ry rock stars and starry-eyed fans 
were expected to purchase the 
products. Veterans who retired or 
lost steam — Diddy, Jay Z, 50 Cent 
and more — expanded into less 
artistic industries and the expres-
sive lifestyle that the genre once 
stood for started to dissolve into a 
corporate scheme. Artists’ focus-
es seemed to switch to creating 
crossover hits and earning enough 
celebrity status to do an expensive 
endorsement. Hip hop’s humanity 
was dwindling.

Throughout the aughts, Lil 

Wayne combatted this mental-
ity switch ferociously. He released 
what felt like infinite mixtapes 
of fully engaged lyrical exercises 
for free on the Internet and chal-
lenged peers to match his work 
ethic by rapping on beats that 
belonged to them. From 2003 to 
2007, he pushed out 11 free proj-
ects and two major-label albums. 
In between his own hits, he 
hopped on other artists’ songs to 
stay creative. An avid sports fan 
and 
self-described 
competitor, 

he started rapping at eight-years-
old and released his first album 
at age 15. Much like Michael 
Jackson, Dwayne Carter seems 
to view himself as a performer 
first, human being second. He 

never “turns off” Lil Wayne. Years 
before hip hop’s morphing with 
social media, he worked endlessly 
to be present in his fans’ lives.

It should be unsurprising, then, 

that Lil Wayne’s first literary 
endeavor is a chillingly personal 

memoir. But what’s 
most intriguing is 
its setting: Rikers 
Island Correctional 
Facility. In Novem-
ber 2010, Lil Wayne 
was sentenced to a 
year in prison for 
firearm possession, 
and though other 
rappers have served 
time 
— 
notably, 

Bobby Shmurda, who’s still incar-
cerated, and Gucci Mane, who was 
released in June — few have done 
it with the theatrical quality of Lil 
Wayne, who was well-represented 
by his then-rookie prodigy, Drake, 
during his absence and even 
appeared on new songs from jail.

Lil Wayne’s first book — titled 

“Gone ’Til November” and pub-
lished in his handwriting — 
offers unfiltered glimpses at the 
thoughts and emotions that fueled 
the rapper’s persistence through-
out his incarceration. It’s more of 
a cathartic clearing of conscience 
than a project designed for fans: 
the journal is part of a daily regi-
men that Wayne creates to stay 
busy and sane. His other routine 
activities include watching televi-
sion in the dayroom, listening to 
sports on the radio, praying and 
making phone calls to friends, 
family or his children (whom he 
refuses to allow to see him in pris-
on, despite never wasting a visita-
tion day).

On the second day of his 

sentence, 
Wayne 
becomes 

acquainted 
with 
a 
group 

of inmates that he calls a 
“brotherhood,” and its members 
ease each others’ time by sharing 
food, wisdom and conversation. 
A lot of the group’s activities 
are documented in “Gone ’Til 
November” — cooking dinners 
with items from commissary, 
watching sports and fantasizing 
about the outside — and Wayne 
narrates their routine with an 
underlying sense of gratitude. 
When Flea, one of his peers, is 
released, he says: “I am happy like 
I am getting out.” When Coach, 
another peer, wants to marry 

another inmate, Wayne grabs a 
Bible and officiates the ceremony. 
He often sounds stripped from 
star power and humbled by his 
surroundings. Wayne sincerely 
cares about his peers’ happiness.

Yet “Gone ’Til November” is 

filled with analyses of different 
guards and the special privileges 
that each grants Lil Wayne. On his 
first day, two female guards are 
suspended for leaving their posts 
to seek him out and Wayne accepts 
the news as proof that attracted 
fans will pursue him anywhere. 
The most exciting thing about this 
book is its constant and inevitable 
Lil Wayne-ness: even while incar-
cerated, his optimism and humor 
remain mostly intact. His visitors 
include Diddy, Chris Paul and 
Kanye West; he makes a phone 
call to order a new Ranger Rover 
after seeing it in a commercial; 
he doesn’t wear the same pair of 
underwear more than once.

It’s been years since Lil Wayne 

released a relevant solo album. 
With “Gone ’Til November,” he 
offers something different to 
appease fans while court battles 
with Birdman, his former busi-
ness partner and father figure, 
continue to restrain his musical 
freedom. In the book’s preface, he 
notes that he didn’t initially intend 
to publish the journal. Thus, some 
sections are scarily dark and hope-
less. Wayne’s willingness to share 
such deeply pained material is 
another example of his unswerv-
ing commitment to pleasing fans.

During a mild confessional that 

occurred on Twitter last month, 
Lil Wayne hinted at his retire-
ment and publicly dreaded his 
own helplessness. He claimed that 
his final album, Tha Carter V, is 
finished and sitting in a drawer, 
waiting to be released at the con-
venience of Birdman. “I AM NOW 
DEFENSELESS AND MENTAL-
LY DEFEATED,” he wrote. It’s an 
upsetting road to retirement for a 
performer who was once the best 
at his craft, who has been cited 
as a major influencer by younger 
stars like Kendrick Lamar and 
Chance the Rapper, who actively 
steered hip hop toward its mod-
ern, anarchic race to release music 
constantly. He should at least be 
able to walk away from his field 
at peace. Lil Wayne tweeted that 
he: “ain’t lookin for sympathy, just 
serenity.” I hope he’s able to find it.

SALVATORE DIGIOIA

‘November’ full of heart, history

Lil Wayne memoir chronicles his experience being incarcerated

It’s the blurring of traditional 

gender roles with non-conforma-
tive ones; it’s the cognitive dis-
sonance that accompanies men 
acting as women 
and women as men; 
it’s the reversal of 
sex and sexuality 
in a play written by 
one of literature’s 
most eccentric, con-
troversial 
homo-

sexuals. It’s a case of 
mistaken identity.

As written, “The 

Importance 
of 

Being Earnest” is a 
comedy masked in 
layers. Written by Oscar Wilde and 
published in 1895, the play centers 
around relationships, specifically, 
the relationships of two men and 
women who fall in love over the 
course of the play. But of course, 

simplicity is not an option in a Wil-
dian world or in a comedy, and as 
these two men, Jack and Algernon, 
pursue courtship, they digress into 
a web of lies tied together by the 
name “Earnest” — the man they’re 
both pretending to be.

Apparently, according to Wilde, 

women prefer a man 
named Earnest; it’s 
the 
predominant 

aspect we look for 
in a man. As confu-
sion arises over the 
course of the writ-
ten play and the 
men’s lies devolve 
into 
chaos, 
their 

façade is mercifully 
put to an end. But in 
a campus produc-
tion from the Rude 

Mechanicals, a key aspect of the 
facade persists through the cast.

Opening 
Thursday, 
Rude 

Mechanical’s production of “The 
Importance of Being Earnest” fea-
tures an all-female cast with the 

exception of one boy, who will be 
playing Lady Bracknell, a role tradi-
tionally played by a man dressed in 
drag. A play that is already charac-
terized by deceit, this feature adds 
an entirely new dimension to the 
dynamics of deception.

“It was an interesting season 

for the U-Prod mainstage. They 
had very male heavy casting, so 
we were trying to figure out how 
we could compensate for that in a 
show that has a decent sized male 
cast,” School of Music, Theater 
and Dance junior Elle Smith. “My 
assistant director and I were brain-
storming and trying to figure out 
how we compensate for that. We 
had this idea, that originally wasn’t 
anything we were ever expecting to 
do, but then thought, ‘An all-female 
production of Earnest? That could 
totally work.’ And then we realized 
that it really could work.”

Taking place in post-war Britain 

during the 1950s, in this adaptation 
not only will the men be played by 
women; there won’t be men at all 

NATALIE ZAK

Daily Community Culture Editor

Rude’s original spin on ‘Earnest’

Resurrected theater troupe takes on Oscar Wilde’s most famous play

COMMUNITY CULTURE PREVIEW
— the traditional characters are 
revisioned as women disguising 
themselves as men in an attempt 
to come to terms with both the 
spheres of separation instilled in 
the 1950s home, as well as the spec-
trum upon which their sexuality 
lies.

“During the 1950s and coming 

off of World War II, there were 
more women in the workforce, so 
we’s picturing Jack and Algernon 
and their female identities as they 
would have been involved in that,” 
Smith said. “But then, “Oh, the 
men are back from war’ and they 
lose all this independence they had 
during the war time, so they create 
these two male alter egos that they 
wouldn’t have been able to have as 
women.”

All of this — the elaborate analy-

sis of these women, their sexual-
ity and their places in a post-war 
society — exist under the umbrella 
of the original play’s script. Noth-
ing has been verbally changed to 
accommodate this drastic creative 
interpretation of the play. Through 
the careful emphasis on certain 
pronouns and pointed stage direc-
tion, the goal of conveying these 
women’s stories is achieved, and at 
no cost to the central theme of love.

“We’ve been playing with this 

idea that the character Jack is a les-
bian, and the only way she can work 

through her sexuality is by pre-
tending to be a man,” Smith said. 
“Whereas Algernon, who is essen-
tially Wilde inserted into the play, 
loves everything and does every-
thing and lives this life of complete 
pleasure and finds herself caught 
off guard by Cecily and surprised 
by falling in love with her.”

As the first of two shows put on 

by Rude Mechanicals this year, 
“The Importance of Being Ear-
nest” opens their 20th anniversary 
season. Rude is re-solidifying its 
place on campus under the leader-
ship of producers Lindsay Harkins, 
a SMTD senior studying perfor-
mance arts management, and Vio-
let Kelly-Andrews, a SMTD junior 
in the same program.

“It’s mostly about us trying to 

give Rude more credibility now by 
continuing producers. Because it’s 
student-run theater, it’s really just 
about opportunity and experiences 
for students,” Kelly-Andrews said. 
“People don’t know about Rude 
Mechanicals yet though because it 
has only just been raised from the 
dead.”

“Earnest” appears to be a strong 

promise from Rude Mechanical’s 
resurrection. Broaching sexuality 
and gender as accepted in 2016 and 
placing it in the 1950s with a script 
from the 1890s brings “an inter-
esting mix of ideals from differ-

ent generations that actually work 
really well together” Smith said, 
while also adding to the continuous 
layers that envelop this production.

And although Rude has only 

recently been revived, as an under-
dog it has room to grow, along with 
a vast community of students in 
and outside of SMTD who audition 
for shows.

“We’re definitely the underdog 

but that’s what makes it exciting,” 
Violet said. “The payoff is so much 
more worth it. When we accom-
plish something it’s a huge accom-
plishment, and it’s an amazing to 
feel like you’re working on some-
thing that’s brand new but also 
been around for a while.”

Just like the play itself, Rude 

Mechanical exists within the curi-
ous paradox of old and new, having 
both a sense of freshness and youth, 
while also holding a certain legacy. 
But this paradox plays to their 
advantage, for as Smith’s direction 
of “Earnest” demonstrates, any 
limitations can be handled — and 
handled in style.

There’s an underlying sense that 

Wilde would approve of the direc-
tion his beloved play has taken in 
this production, for as Algernon 
exclaims in one of his Wildian epi-
taphs, “In matters of grave impor-
tance, style, not sincerity, is the 
vital thing.”

“Nice Free People caftan.” “Nice Ann Taylor shift dress.”

With the burgeoning progres-

siveness of peak TV, Amazon’s 
newest drama “Good Girls Revolt” 
should’ve been a real 
standout. Created by 
“Narcos” co-execu-
tive producer Dana 
Calvo and adapted 
from the book “The 
Good Girls Revolt” 
by 
Lynn 
Povich, 

the show has all the 
workings for a great 
television program: it contains an 
unexpectedly great cast, glossy pro-
duction values and several inspired 
moments. Additionally, “Good Girls 
Revolt” features feminist overtones, 
including strong female leads who 
pass the Bechdel test and subvert 
trite depictions of female TV char-
acters. The problem is that “Good 
Girls Revolt” squanders its poten-
tial by turning a powerful true story 
into something that is less so.

Though “Good Girls Revolt” suc-

ceeds in some aspects, its promis-
ing premise is unfortunately poorly 
executed, suffering from sluggish 
pacing, scattered storytelling and 
middling dialogue. The Amazon 
show is definitely on the right track 
to work its way up the very steep 
ladder of streaming television pro-
grams, but it has a while before it 
can reach the dramatic heights and 
emotional depth of its ’60s drama 
counterpart “Mad Men.”

Technically, the plot of “Good 

Girls Revolt” is based off an actual 
sexual discrimination lawsuit filed 
against Newsweek in 1970. But 
the show alters the story slightly, 
instead following a group of female 
researchers at the esteemed New 
York magazine News of the Week in 

1969, headed by Don 
Draper 
lookalike 

Finn 
Woodhouse 

(Chris 
Diamanto-

poulos, “The Three 
Stooges”) and the 
irritable 
Wick 

McFadden 
(Jim 

Belushi, “Show Me a 
Hero”). “Good Girls 

Revolt” includes only two real-life 
characters, screenwriter Nora Eph-
ron (Grace Gummer, “Mr. Robot”) 
and American Civil Liberties Union 
activist Eleanor Holmes Norton 
(Joy Bryant, “Parenthood”), but the 
fictitious characters are surprising-
ly more compelling.

At the forefront of the cast are 

the hippie, peace-loving Patti (Gen-
evieve Angelson, “Backstrom”), the 
stuck-up but confident Jane (Anna 
Camp, “Pitch Perfect”) and the 
mousy photo copier Cindy (Erin 
Darke, “Don’t Think Twice”), all 
of whom showcase a passion for 
journalism, especially when Eph-
ron takes a stand against McFad-
den in a pivotal scene at the end of 
the pilot episode. While each actor 
gives 
admirable 
performances, 

specifically Camp and Angelson, 
there remains some hollowness to 
the show.

With each episode ranging 

from 45 to 54 minutes, “Good 

Girls Revolt” drains many of its 
positive qualities with a cluttered, 
unfocused narrative. Interesting 
plot developments, such as Patti’s 
on-and-off romance with her co-
worker Doug (Hunter Parrish, 
“Weeds”), are downplayed and 
overlap with mediocre plot points. 
The other romances between the 
characters feel cliché and over-
done, showcasing an overt amount 
of sexual tension that will make 
your eyes roll.

Scenes 
that 
involve 
female 

empowerment come off as some-
what preachy, especially when Bry-
ant’s character, who is one of the 
show’s only women of color, is dele-
gated to playing a slight stereotype 
of the wise Black woman offering 
advice to white, privileged women 
on how to stick it to the man.

That being said, “Good Girls 

Revolt” addresses office sexism 
and discrimination in a complex, 
nuanced way, propelling the trio of 
female researchers toward combat-
ing their domineering male coun-
terparts with a drive to succeed in 
the world of journalism.

“Good Girls Revolt” could have 

been transcendent, had it cut out a 
lot of its familiar elements — its too-
obvious 1960s references, lengthy 
sequences of dialogue and predict-
able romantic entanglements. Still, 
with the rise of female voices on 
television, whether through writ-
ing, directing or acting, “Good 
Girls Revolt” represents a fine, 
albeit flawed example of the kinds 
of gripping stories that can be told 
through a female perspective.

Fandom is a tough concept 

to make concrete. The extent 
to which we, as spectators, love 
certain forms of entertainment 
cannot be definitively graded, 
and while it might be more 
important to just absorb the 
entertainment 
rather 
than 

assess our appreciation for it, 
how genuinely we experience 
things does matter. Celebrities 
Aziz Ansari and Donald Glover 
(aka “Childish Gambino”), for 
example, seemed to be LCD 
Soundsystem fans, completely 
losing their shit in various clips 
of “Shut Up and Play the Hits,” 
which documented the band’s 
(then) farewell concert in 2011 
at Madison Square Garden. 
As did the “crying boy,” a boy 
who was shown legitimately 
bawling for the duration of that 
same show.

Levels 
of 
fandom 
are 

relevant here, because after 
an incredibly draining day, 
we were in a sea of diehards 
for 
LCD’s 
headlining 
set 

July 31 at Lollapalooza in 
Chicago’s Grant Park. This 
is important, not as much 
because the crowd of mostly 
twenty-somethings 
around 

us were more “sophisticated” 
or “mature,” but because the 
teens rolling face were finally, 
and 
appropriately, 
confined 

to the suburban high school 
enclave that is the adjacent 
Perry’s stage.

This? This was a set for 

the fans, and on that festival-
closing 
night, 
fandom 

manifested 
itself 
as 
total, 

complete and unadulterated 
joy. James Murphy, Nancy 
Whang and the rest of the gang 
proved they have a special 
way of causing this. Maybe it’s 
the distinct sound, or just the 
memories we have associated 
with 
this 
sound. 
They 

disbanded in 2011 and, while 
we all thought that was the 
end, it wasn’t; it was July 2016, 
and we were able to experience 
their reunion tour and hear 
this sound once more.

What started off as a roll 

call of hits — “Us V Them,” 
“Daft Punk Is Playing at My 
House” and “I Can Change” 
supplied the set with tons 
of 
early 
momentum 
— 

gave way to the organized 
chaos 
of 
“Tribulations” 

and “Movement.” The band 
sounded 
good, 
but 
more 

important, they had us locked 
in. Bodies jumping up and 
down, swaying back and forth; 
cultish, in the best type of way.

Interspersed in the madness 

were sincerely earnest words 
from Murphy, snippets like 
“thank you guys for being very 
sweet to us … you never know, 
you could just hate us and be 
here just to throw things, but 
thank you for hanging out and 
listening.” But the privilege 
was all ours. After all, it would 
be foolish not to feel privileged 
to see this act, an act that 
had once been thought of as 
extinct. Beyond that, it was 
necessary to appreciate the 
sheer perfection of the set. 
Murphy often looks tense on 
stage, maybe even pained. It 
seems to come out of severely 
perfectionist 
tendencies. 

It’s not easy to synchronize 
a 
conglomerate 
of 
music 

machinery into harmonious 
poetry. 

Consequently, raw emotions 

hit, and the waterworks peaked 
during “Home.” The feeling 
of truly being back home, of 
remembering the rough nights 
— albeit with the right people 
— got to me: “And after rolling 
on the floor / And thankfully, 
a few make sure that you get 
home / And you stay home / 
And you better.” The song, off 
of This Is Happening (2010), 
unlocked a bundle of memories 
and future uncertainties, and 
such 
an 
anxiety-inducing 

package hit hard.

The 
unique 
thing 
about 

LCD Soundsystem’s music, in 
fact, is just how emotionally 
exhausting it is. In nearly every 
song, 
there’s 
an 
especially 

methodical intro, a prodding 
hook 
and 
a 
meticulously 

plotted out comedown. And 
so, we respond as such: where 
is it, what is it, where is it, oh 
wow, oh my gosh, wow, well 
OK that was cool, wow. Repeat. 
Each song is grounded in pure 
catharsis. So, in the span of one 
Lollapalooza set, it’s like being 
thrown on 14 ultra-sentimental 
loops, 
for 
90 
consecutive 

minutes, surrounded by equally 
overwhelmed people.

A 
lot 
of 
the 
audience, 

including me, were with our 
friends that night, the same 
friends with whom we have 
been listening to LCD for 
years: 
the 
awkward 
years, 

the pressure-filled years, the 
transitional years. LCD had 
carried us through it all. This 
aforementioned 
catharsis 

proved to be overpowering. 
By the time the first notes of 
“All My Friends” rang out — 
urgent, but distinct, notes — 
we were all sobbing. “Where 
are your friends tonight?” Our 
friends were there, and other 
peoples’ friends were there. 
James Murphy had created, for 
one night, friends everywhere. 
That night, we were all crying 
boy.

MUSIC NOTEBOOK

TV REVIEW

In the spirit of Halloween, 

entertainment and media out-
lets are (rightfully) capitalizing 
on all things spooky. And since 
one 
can 
never 

have too many 
period 
pieces, 

BBC 
America 

has wrapped up 
horror and 19th-
century England 
into 
one 
pack-

age. “The Living 
and the Dead,” a 
six-episode mini-
series, 
has 
the 

right setup for a 
compelling end-
of-October binge, but falls flat 
in execution.

Nathan Appleby (Colin Mor-

gan, “Merlin”) and his wife 
Charlotte (Charlotte Spencer, 
“Above”) inherit a struggling 
family farm in Somerset, Eng-
land, only to be haunted by the 
supernatural. Nathan, a turn-
of-the-century 
psychologist 

from London who believes in 
science and logic, spirals down 
a dangerous path as he seeks 
an explanation for the mysti-
cal forces that are plaguing his 
vicarage. Before long, Nathan 
is forced to face the memory 
and ghost of his dead son from 
a previous wife, further strain-
ing his relationship with Char-
lotte in the process.

The series pilot introduces 

“The Living and the Dead” 
’s supernatural elements as a 
neighbor’s daughter becomes 
possessed by ghosts of farm-
ers past. She’s just scared of 

her own sexuality, Nathan psy-
choanalyzes, as the adolescent 
girl attempts to murder one of 
the farmworkers. The theme 
of science vs. supernatural 
emerges early on, and is car-
ried throughout the season as 
Nathan attempts (and fails) to 

use his practice 
to 
explain 
the 

tragedies. 
But 

the series strays 
from good old-
fashioned haunt-
ings when it tries 
to pull an origi-
nal surprise — a 
decision that is 
perhaps its big-
gest misstep. At 
the end of the 
first episode, a 

woman dressed in 21st-century 
apparel and carrying an iPad 
walks through the 1894 man-
sion. Adding time travel is 
risky: the genre has developed 
so many tropes that it’s nearly 
impossible to find an original 
take. In the case of “The Liv-
ing and the Dead,” it not only 
opens up room for clichés but, 
more importantly, completely 
invalidates the 19th-century 
England the series attempts to 
recreate. What is supposed to 
be a “twist” is so jarring and 
out of place that it destroys the 
historical feel necessary to cre-
ate a believable period piece.

What “The Living and the 

Dead” does best is deliver an 
aesthetically 
pleasing 
view-

ing 
experience. 
The 
shots 

of countryside England are 
whimsical — warm and almost 
sepia-toned, as if taken right 
out of an old photo book. 
Colin Morgan’s jawline isn’t 

too hard on the eyes either, 
but a successful series needs 
more than an attractive lead 
to keep an audience engaged. 
Both Morgan and Spencer play 
characters that are difficult to 
connect with and draw on emo-
tions that are almost too unre-
latable. 
Their 
performances 

aren’t strong enough to grab an 
audience through the discon-
nect of both another time and 
a world plagued by the undead, 
serving to only further alienate 
the series from success.

Period pieces act like a 

mirror: they reflect an aspect 
of the present day through 
the 
lens 
of 
another 
time. 

Stories set hundreds, even 
thousands, of year back can 
still be unbelievably relevant 
to the modern viewer, because 
themes of humanity, justice 
and hope have not changed 
throughout the timeline of the 
human experience. Yet the 
BBC America series isn’t able 
to establish that connection. 
Without 
the 
humor 
of 

“Downton Abbey” or the thrill 
of “American Horror Story,” it’s 
no surprise that “The Living 
and the Dead” wasn’t renewed 
for a second season.

Michigan searching for an identity

Michigan hockey coach Red 

Berenson knew right away.

At 
Thompson 
Arena 
on 

Saturday night, he saw his 
players 
disheartened 
and 

discouraged. After battling with 
Dartmouth the whole game, his 
then-11th-ranked Wolverines let 
up a late goal to lose 3-2 to the Big 
Green. Michigan’s players looked 
to their coach for a message of 
motivation in a weekend when it 
lost both of its games.

“His message was that we did 

good things, but there’s still some 
things we have to get better at,” 
said senior defenseman Nolan 
de Jong. “It was a glimpse of 
what we can be, rather than the 
Vermont game where we pretty 
much struggled throughout the 
entire game — there wasn’t very 
much pushback from us. 

“At least we kind of see the 

team we can be. See the energy, 
the legs, the enthusiasm that we 
can play with. It’s a good sign. 
We gotta keep improving every 
day.”

Through seven games, the 

Wolverines stand with a .500 
record and many questions. 
Michigan’s lines continue to 
shift nearly every period, and its 
goaltending situation remains 
a mystery until just before puck 
drop. If the Wolverines had 
consistently 
outplayed 
their 

opponents, these aspects would 
be solidified. But until they do, 
Berenson believes it necessary to 
constantly tinker with his lineup 
and netminders.

As the third-youngest team in 

college hockey — with an average 
age of 20.9 — another coach 
might be easily frustrated having 
to teach his new system to a fresh 

set of players. But Berenson — in 
his 33rd year in Ann Arbor — is 
used to it.

“Even 
though 
we’ve 
had 

maybe not as many freshman, 
you look at the age of our team, 
it’s always been around 18,19 
or 20,” Berenson said. “... We’re 
helping them develop and learn 
how to play at this level and 
they’re already ready. You’ve 
seen 
Lockwood 
and 
Slaker, 

they’ve already made an impact 
on this team. It’s not like they 
have to be reinvented. These kids 
know how to play hockey. Some of 
them are more ready than others. 

It’s our job as a group to help 
them all make the adjustment on 
where to fit in.”

In De Jong’s 

freshman 
year, the team 
struggled 
at 

times, including 
a 
four-game 

losing streak and 
a month when it 
won just four of 
nine games. As a 
first-year player, 
he looked to his 
older leaders (former Michigan 
defenseman Mac Bennett and 

former forward Derek DeBlois) 
for guidance. 

“They 
were 

the 
guys 
who 

no matter what 
happened, 
whether we lost 
10-1 or we won 
10-1 they were 
always in here 
putting 
their 

work 
in,” 
De 

Jong said. “Doing 
extra things in 
the weight room 

or on the ice, they were always 
trying to get better, which is 

something I looked up to a lot.”

Now 
as 
a 
senior 
leader 

and captain, De Jong says he 
“absolutely” sees himself in that 
role.

“It’s not always going to be 

things that I say, but it’s going to 
be things that have to show,” De 
Jong said.

“That’s going to be if we have 

a conditioning skate at the end, 
even if I’m not the fastest guy 
out there, I’m gonna be the guy 
that’s gonna push it all the way 
to the goal line or get those 
extra few strides in. Whether I 
have to block a shot in practice 

or whatever to kinda show guys 
that I’m all in.”

The 
Wolverines 
have 

spent these first seven games 
constructing their own identity, 
one that already looks drastically 
different from last season’s, in 
which its prolific offense had an 
immediate impact in games. This 
year, though, Michigan is still in 
the midst of developing its own 
distinct character.

The growing pains that the 

Wolverines inevitably have faced 
are simply a part of the game, 
according to Berenson. He will 
keep readjusting and focusing 
in order to find groups that work 
and succeed together.

“This is our team now and it’s 

about creating an identity and 
creating the personality for our 
team,” De Jong said. “I think 
we have a lot of youth and that 
should bring a lot of excitement 
and I think at this point in the 
season, we can’t be using youth 
or a young team as an excuse.

“(It is) time to push forward. 

We’re going to have to be a hard 
team to play against. A fast team, 
stingy defensively and I think 
goaltending is going to be a big 
part of our team. I think we’re 
still working on the identity but 
we’re going to get there.

Added Berenson: “We haven’t 

really played the kind of hockey 
that I think our players think we 
can play, or the coaches think 
we can play. We gotta build 
whatever identity that is. Our 
next game is our best chance 
to take a step in that direction. 
You’re not gonna do it all in one 
game, or a week or a weekend, 
but I think if we start seeing 
the same results, better results 
in certain areas then we’ll start 
getting an identity that we can 
believe in as a group.”

Panel tackles issues of polling, Twitter and cybersecurity

With the general election six 

days away, topics dominating 
the national conversation such 
as the influence of Twitter on 
the election, the vulnerability of 
America’s voting technology to 
hackers and whether a shift to 
electronic voting could solve it 
were discussed at a University 
of Michigan Information and 
Technology 
Services 
panel 

discussion 
titled 
“Disrupting 

Democracy: How Technology is 
Influencing Elections.”

The event was moderated by 

the host of Michigan Radio’s 
Morning Edition, Doug Tribou, 
and attended by approximately 
60 students, faculty and staff 
members.

Alex Halderman, a professor 

of engineering and computer 
science who was a panelist 
at 
the 
event, 
researches 

polling technology and voting 
machines 
by 
deconstructing 

government 
machines 
and 

conducting 
security 
analyses 

on them. During his remarks, 
he 
emphasized 
cybersecurity 

concerns that surround polling 
technology in an age of increasing 
digital connectivity, as well as 
increased cyber concerns over 
hacking by non-state and foreign 
actors.

“Unfortunately, the security 

is nowhere near where it should 
be,” 
Halderman 
said. 
“The 

problem is that about a quarter of 
American voters, even today, will 
be voting on technology on voting 
machines that don’t produce any 
form of physical record.”

To illustrate more specific 

concerns 
over 
exclusively 

electronic 
voting, 
Halderman 

spoke 
about 
how 
in 
2010, 

Washington, D.C. staged a mock 
election in which all polling 
would be conducted via the 
Internet. Officials in D.C. invited 
computer scientists and hackers 
to infiltrate the voting system’s 
network so as to learn about 
potential 
issues 
with 
online 

voting. Halderman and a team of 
UM students took up the district’s 
offer and, within two days, they 
were in complete control of the 

voting system.

“I am not sure how many 

people 
can 
be 
reading 
the 

newspaper 
or 
watching 
TV 

today, and think that it would be 
a good idea to take our election 
system and just put it at a website 
somewhere that could be reached 
from anywhere in the world,” 
Halderman said.

Chris 
Dzombak, 
another 

panelist, 
also 
stressed 
the 

vulnerability of America’s polling 
infrastructure, saying it has not 
received nearly enough attention 
this election cycle. Dzombak 
is an Ann Arbor resident who 
works for The New York Times 
as 
a 
software 
engineer 
for 

iOS development. He said he’s 
discussed the increasing issue 
of cyberattacks on governments 
with his coworkers.

“We have seen more and more 

higher profile sort of Internet and 

computer security issues as these 
sort of things are becoming more 
and more common,” Dzombak 
said. “A paper audit trail and 
checking it against the results 
are important and they seem like 
common sense security measures 
and I am really disappointed 
we have not implemented these 
measures.”

Panelist Walter Mebane, a 

professor of political science 
and statistics, also discussed 
his research on U.S. elections 
and election forensics, a field 
of study that analyzes ballot 
formats 
and 
compares 
the 

merits 
of 
voting 
machines. 

Mebane said when a social 
media site like Twitter becomes 
the central place that voters 
to turn for information on 
the election, the inability to 
disprove a lot of the information 
disseminated on the site allows 

rumors and misinformation to 
run rampant.

“Twitter can certainly be 

used to spread rumors and 
misinformation … as it is a 
kind of weird universe where 
credible information is hard to 
establish,” Mebane said.

Beyond the issue of spreading 

misinformation, Mebane said 
Twitter and social media is 
often bifurcated, or divided 
based on the preferences of 
the consumer. Noting the high 
polarization characterizing the 
current election, he said this 
bifurcation lets users only seek 
out like-minded individuals and 
consume political information 
that aligns only with their 
previously held viewpoints.

“If the post-election behavior 

mirrors 
the 
pre-election 

behavior, one set, one group 
saying big fraud, big rigging, big 

problems … regardless of what 
happens there,” Mebane said. 
“That would be an issue and the 
question would be to counteract 
that message if it deserves to 
be counteracted to and have 
that message be supported or 
refuted by evidence.”

LSA sophomore Jamie Pew, 

an attendee, agreed with some 
of the sentiments voiced at the 
event, saying he has noticed his 
Twitter feed features views and 
opinions predominantly in favor 
of 
Democratic 
presidential 

nominee Hillary Clinton and 
related topics.

“I 
have 
a 
very 
narrow 

perception of what’s going on 
in the election and what the 
outcome will probably be,” Pew 
said. “It is definitely a challenge 
to find the right people to 
follow, both Democrats and 
people who are conservative.”

If 
the 
college 
football 

season 
ended 
today, 
the 

Michigan football team would 
have a chance to compete for 
the national championship.

The Wolverines ranked No. 

3 in the first College Football 
Playoff poll released Tuesday 
night. At the end of the year, 
the top four will reach the 
playoff, with the first- and 
fourth-ranked 
teams 
and 

second- 
and 
third-ranked 

teams playing each other and 
then the winners of those 
games playing for the national 
title. 
The 
semifinals 
this 

year for the teams that make 
the playoff are in Atlanta 
and Glendale, Ariz., and the 
championship 
game 
is 
in 

Tampa, Fla.

Alabama (8-0) earns the 

top-ranked spot this week, 
with Clemson (8-0) at No. 
2. Texas A&M (7-1), despite 
losing to the Crimson Tide, 
33-14, is the final team in the 
top four, ahead of undefeated 
Washington at No. 5.

Michigan’s opponents also 

earned a strong showing in the 
poll, with Wisconsin (6-2) at 
No. 8 and Colorado (6-2) at No. 
15. The Wolverines beat the 
Badgers on Oct. 1, 14-7, and the 
Buffaloes on Sept. 17, 45-28. 
One of the biggest surprises 
in the rankings is Penn State 
at No. 12. The Nittany Lions 
struggled earlier in the year 
and lost at Michigan Stadium, 
49-10, on Sept. 24. They make 
an appearance in the poll in 
large part because of their 
upset of then-No. 2 Ohio State 
on Oct. 22.

The Buckeyes (7-1) come in 

at No. 6 in the rankings and 
play Saturday night at home 
against No. 10 Nebraska (7-1), 
the fourth Big Ten team in the 
top 10.

Michigan turns to Bens to carry O-line’s left side

One of the Bens on the left 

side of Michigan’s offensive 
line is a fifth-year senior, and 
the other is a true freshman, 
but the similarities between 
them outweigh the differences.

Ben Braden, a fifth-year 

senior from Rockford, Mich., 
will make his 32nd career start 
on the Wolverines’ offensive 
line 
this 
weekend 
against 

Maryland. Ben Bredeson, a 
true freshman from Hartland, 
Wisc., will likely make his 
fourth.

The two lived next to each 

other for the duration of fall 
camp, and now they play next 
to each other, Braden at left 
tackle, Bredeson at left guard. 
In addition to their dorm this 
summer and their first name, 
they also share a meeting room, 
a heritage from the Upper 
Midwest and a love of hockey.

Michigan made the change 

during its bye week to start both 
of them against Illinois on Oct. 
22 and against Michigan State 
on Saturday. After starting left 
tackle Grant Newsome suffered 
a season-ending knee injury Oct. 
1, the Wolverines gave redshirt 
sophomore 
Juwann 
Bushell-

Beatty the nod at that position 
the next week against Rutgers. 
They also started Bredeson 
in place of Braden — who has 
battled injuries for most of the 
season — at left guard.

Michigan then emerged from 

its bye week in a new alignment, 
starting Braden at left tackle 
for the first time in his career. 
It was not a drastic change, nor 
did it respond to a significant 
need. But when the Wolverines 
tested different arrangements 
during their week off, they 
found success with Braden and 
Bredeson on the left side, and 
so the two Bens it was.

“We were constantly fluid, 

changing things up all the 
time,” Bredeson said. “You 

just have to stay ready, and 
that’s what I did. That’s what 
everyone on the line does. We 
all have to be ready to go when 
our number gets called.”

That wasn’t always the case. 

Michigan started the same 
five offensive linemen in the 
same five spots for all 13 games 
last season. Newsome, who 
occasionally played as a sixth 
offensive lineman, was the only 
other one to play significant 
snaps.

This year, the Wolverines 

have 
used 
four 
different 

combinations, with all of the 
changes coming on the left 
side. Part of the fluctuation is 
because of Newsome’s injury, 
and another part is depth 

— Michigan did not have 
Bredeson last year, and Bushell-
Beatty played sparingly until 
last month.

The unit also appears to 

be more versatile this season. 
Junior 
center 
Mason 
Cole 

started at left tackle for two 
years. Bredeson often draws 
comparisons to him for his 
ability to move around. And 
until Braden went in at left 
tackle during the bye week, he 
had not practiced there since 
fall camp.

Among Michigan’s group, 

Bredeson steps into a group 
with three fifth-year seniors 
and another three-year starter 
in Cole. He seems to have built 
a particularly strong rapport 

with Braden.

When he first spoke to 

media in late September before 
the Wisconsin game, he said 
Braden had mentored him “a lot 
more than you can imagine.” 
The two also room together in 
the team hotel the night before 
each game.

“He’s helped me with plays, 

protections, pregame tests, life, 
basically everything,” Bredeson 
said in September. “… He has 
gone far out of his way to help 
me, mentally and physically, 
with the game.”

Braden 
gives 
similarly 

complimentary remarks about 
Bredeson, who backed him 
up at left guard before both 
cracked the starting lineup and 

who appears to be the future of 
the offensive line.

“Bredeson’s a good kid,” 

Braden said. “He works really 
hard. Smart guy, great attitude, 
great character. … I’ve really 
enjoyed getting to know him, 
and I definitely see myself 
growing with our friendship 
even 
when 
I’m 
not 
here 

anymore.”

As 
for 
the 
roommate 

assignment 
that 
sparked 
a 

particularly close friendship, 
Bredeson isn’t sure how that 
came about.

“I couldn’t tell you,” he said. 

“They just decided to make 
it confusing and put the two 
guys with the closest names 
together.”

AMANDA ALLEN/Daily

Fifth-year senior offensive lineman Ben Braden and freshman offensive lineman Ben Bredeson (74) have settled into their positions on the left side of the line.

Cole plays through sickness for standout game

Monday, 
Michigan 
coach 

Jim Harbaugh said that his 
youngsters would have to start 
drinking more whole milk. He 
wasn’t talking about his growing 
children, though.

Instead, it was his response 

to senior tight end Jake Butt 
and junior center Mason Cole, 
who were battling sicknesses 
last week. Both were still able to 
see the field and had a hand in 
defeating Michigan State, 32-23, 
and Cole even received high 
praise from Harbaugh.

“Mason Cole, there’s a guy,” 

Harbaugh said. “And I’ve always 
said this, too, but (I) experienced 
playing some of my best games 
with 
a 
temperature. 
There’s 

something that makes you focus 
more during a game. Mason was 
our offensive lineman of the 
week. I thought he had the best 
performance of our offensive 
line.”

Harbaugh 
also 
suggested 

doing more push-ups and using 
hand sanitizer to combat illness, 
though Cole’s sickness didn’t 
seem to have much of a negative 
impact on his game.

While he doesn’t necessarily 

agree with Harbaugh’s belief that 
being sick can set up for a great 
game, he understands where his 
coach is coming from.

“I can see what he’s saying,” 

Cole said. “When you’re not 
feeling right, you just focus on 
you. You kind of put everything 
else aside and you have to focus 
on you 100 percent to do your 
job.”

Nothing was going to detract 

from playing his in-state rival, 
and at no point did he anticipate 
being absent from the Michigan 
State game. 

“(My illness) really wasn’t that 

big of a deal,” Cole said. “There’s 

not much that can take you away 
from playing in that kind of an 
environment. You’ve gotta go 
there and perform and in that 
rivalry game and you just gotta do 
what you gotta do. It wasn’t bad — 
it wasn’t as bad as people made it 
sound.”

He attributed his illness to the 

changing seasons and said that 
people everywhere are working 
through the same thing. Luckily 
for the Wolverines, Cole is back 
to feeling healthy. He may have 
been physically unavailable for 
practice last week, but he said 
that he was there mentally.

As 
a 
three-year 
starter, 

Cole’s absence would be felt 
immediately. After two years at 
left tackle, Cole switched to the 
center position, which is a role 
he feels completely comfortable 
in. Despite spending more time 
at tackle, he now likes playing at 
center more.

Cole held Michigan State’s 

star defensive lineman Malik 
McDowell — who leads the 
Spartans 
with 
seven 
tackles 

for loss on the season — to just 
two tackles last weekend. Cole 
thought he played fairly well, 
despite missing some practice. 
The rest of his team wasn’t quite 
there though.

Michigan’s offense was prolific 

in the first half, scoring 27 points, 
but production slowed in the 
second. One of the offense’s most 
disappointing 
performances 

came during the fourth quarter, 
when Michigan went 2-for-7 
on third down and had just 16 
rushing yards.

“I think you’d like to see us go 

out there and see us get a few first 
downs and close out the game, 
but we didn’t,” Cole said. “But our 
defense came up big, our special 
teams came up big … they saved 
us, but it’s a team effort, and they 
covered us that time.”

Regardless of the changes that 

are occurring on the offensive 
line — with sophomore Grant 
Newsome out for the season and 
freshman Ben Bredeson earning a 
starting role — Cole has emerged 
as Michigan’s rock up in the 
middle.

“I mean, he’s moving people 

and getting his job done down 
after down, playing low and 
fast and physical,” Harbaugh 
said. “He’s really developing 
as a center, there’s no question 
about it. … (I) feel great that this 
is his position. He is an ideal, 
prototypical center and doing 
a great job. Just gotta boost his 
immune system.”

statement

THE MICHIGAN DAILY | NOVEMBER 2, 2016


When I was five, I hated broccoli. I would scream 

and choke and run away for fear that I would have to eat 
broccoli. Cauliflower I would eat, sometimes, if my dad 
melted enough cheese on top. Brussel sprouts? Never.

These reactions to food are similar to how I believe a lot 

of college students feel about cooking. No judgement, by the 
way. I would much rather dump a can of soup into a pot and 
heat it up than roast a chicken and use the leftovers to make 
my own homemade broth. To some, students will always be 
stuck in a Campbell’s soup frame of mind, and that’s totally 
fine. But, for me at least, my taste buds have been affected by 
a mixture of maturation and already decreasing metabolism 
and I now crave a grilled salmon over fish sticks.

(That comparison was mostly made for effect rather than 

truth. I actually sincerely dislike fish sticks and have not 
had one since elementary school. I do, however, sincerely 
love salmon.)

I have always been a decent “chef.” My parents worked 

a lot growing up, and so I had plenty of opportunities 
to start experimenting in the kitchen by myself from a 

young age. My mom taught me fractions using measuring 
cups for baking in kindergarten, making me feel right at 
home behind the stove when I began to move from baking 
brownies to roasting a chicken. Since the beginning of 
high school, my mom and dad would offhandedly describe 
what they were doing when making dishes such as chicken 
cacciatore, brisket, tilapia with asparagus, etc. So I’m very 
confident in saying that when I cook, the food comes out to 
an edible degree.

So, the problem in college isn’t that I prefer pizza rolls to a 

homemade whole-wheat crust margherita pizza garnished 
with fresh basil. It’s that there isn’t enough time in the day 
to spend creating food compared to just heating it up. To 
me, this is the “pizza-roll aesthetic,” in which it is almost 
fashionable to use the kitchen as an oversized microwave 
in college.

Don’t confuse a want for already prepared foods as being 

lazy. I maintain an A GPA average, am the president of a pre-
law sorority, secretary of a law society, work in four major 
roles at the Daily (columnist, women’s basketball beat writer, 

sports night editor and recruitment chair) and hold a job 
as a barista at a coffee shop. When I come home at the end 
of the day, I am looking for something that only requires 
me to stand up for no longer than 10 minutes. Past that 
threshold, I refuse to do anything but cuddle in my bed 
and watch Netflix. Judging by my roommates and friends, 
that sentiment is shared by a lot of my peers — sans the 
occasional spurt of culinary energy and motivation.

But as senior year wears on, I’m more aware of the fact 

that when I leave college I will no longer feel the “pizza-
roll aesthetic” will apply to my life. Or rather, I will feel 
unaccomplished if it does apply. For me, I’m capable of 
more. I’m capable of a “Julia-Child aesthetic.” A lot of that, 
though, begins with grocery shopping and trying new 
things. I’m not suggesting to seniors that we immediately 
replace our beloved pizza rolls with intimidating dishes 
like Thai-style meatballs and roasted butternut squash. I 
am suggesting that we start to strive to make those dishes 
our goal, while evolving pizza rolls into an indulgent 2 
a.m. snack.

T H O U G H T B U B B L E : HALLOWEEN

“My second costume was an impromptu decision 

because someone was selling a halo on the Ladies 

of U of M Facebook page and my friend and I did a 

devil/ angel combined costume. This was probably 

one of my best Halloweens because of how easy it 

was to make costumes.”

– LSA senior Alexandra Meilhac

I’m 20 years old now. I’ve had skewered octopus in Japan, 

alligator in New Orleans, pig cheek in Spain, cacti in New 
Mexico and lobster ice cream in Cape Cod — and I still 
refuse to eat broccoli. I still dislike cauliflower. But I will 
now make, and then eat, brussel sprouts if they’re roasted 
to the point of being charred crisps with no semblance of 
green left.

So, I guess that’s me maturing.
How to: Grocery shop and not buy pizza rolls
1. Coupon AF
2. Get the whole-wheat bread
3. Frozen vegetables? Canned vegetables? Girl.
4. If you’re working with a budget, get the generic brand
5. It actually tastes just as good, Buzzfeed Video has 

proven this

6. Don’t overbuy; if you see something you might use 

maybe, don’t get it

7. Chips and salsa are a staple and/or hummus and pita
8. Buy that instead of your next bag of potato chips
9. Caveat: If you are planning on engaging in nighttime 

fun, make sure your drunchies are satiated at home so you 
don’t feel the need to go out and spend money at 2 a.m.

10. If you can’t cook, no worries; practice makes perfect
11. Food is love, food is life
12. Get all the free samples

I

’m not creative.

I’m just not. I know saying 

that seems like the ultimate 

admission of failure to some, especial-
ly considering my choice to pursue an 
English major, but after a lot of soul-
searching and many failed attempts to 
write the next Great American 
Novel, I’ve come to the some-
what 
depressing 
realization 

that I am just not creative.

I have my creative moments, 

but the thought of sitting down 
to write something completely 
on my own talents and with 
no instructions seems terrify-
ing. Even writing this took me 
weeks of planning and outlin-
ing and it still was not easy for 
me to create something unique 
of which I could be proud. I like 
rules, I adore guidelines and I 
function a heck of a lot better 
with a clear instruction manu-
al. That’s why I love the work-
ing at the copy desk so much.

Not to say that everyone at the 

copy desk is like me, because in 
my time at The Michigan Daily I 
have learned that copy attracts 
creative and witty people with 
a fondness for Oreos and the 
Oxford comma. I simply hap-
pen to thrive in an environment 
where the rules are clearly laid 
out and I have a guide to follow. 
The Stylebook is probably the 
most comforting tab open on 
my computer, all 65 pages of it. 
I’m not creative, and working at 

the copy desk allows me to be a part of 
the creative process where otherwise 
us non-creative people would get shut 
out.

Coming to college, I was under the 

impression that every single intelli-
gent person was also creative — they 

had only original thoughts, they never 
struggled to say something interesting 
and the quality of their work, no matter 
the discipline, always reflected their 
imaginative dispositions. I thought 
that I had to be someone who only ever 
added to the discussion with original 

insight. I thought that being creative 
was a sure-fire way to be successful 
at the University of Michigan and in 
careers beyond.

There wasn’t one specific moment 

when I realized I wasn’t creative and 
decided I was probably doomed to fail 

in any and all future endeavors. 
My creative energy just sort 
of deflated over time, and as I 
realized how utterly uncreative 
I was, I began to see and appre-
ciate all the more the depth 
of creativity that exists in my 
peers. There are some wacky 
and wonderful things going on 
at this University, and my lack 
of creativity means I am often 
on the outside peering in.

The world needs people who 

are creative, but the world also 
needs people like me who love 
creativity but just can’t be a part 
of it. My work at the copy desk 
is probably going to be reflec-
tive of most of my adult career. 
I am not going to write the nar-
rative, but I am going to be able 
to come alongside those who 
are creative and hone and shape 
their work into something that 
is even better. If that involves 
changing “amidst” to “amid” 
and Googling party affiliations 
of city council members for the 
rest of my life, that’s fine with 
me. I’m just happy to be includ-
ed, lack of creativity and all.

“It’s pretty strange to put something like that 
out with such little information right before 
the election... In fact, it’s not just strange; it’s 
unprecedented and it is deeply troubling.”

—HILLARY CLINTON, Democratic presidential nominee, on F.B.I. director 
James B. Comey, who disclosed the agency was looking into potential new 
emails tied to Clinton’s private server on Friday, October 28. 

on the record: “your damn emails”

“As it stands, we now have real-time, raw-take 
transparency taken to its illogical limit, a kind 
of reality TV of federal criminal investigation. 
Perhaps worst of all, it is happening on the eve 
of a presidential election. It is antithetical to the 
interests of justice, putting a thumb on the scale of 
this election and damaging our democracy.” 

— JAMIE GORELICK, former deputy attorney general under President Bill 
Clinton, and LARRY THOMPSON, former deputy attorney general under 
George W. Bush, in an op-ed for The Washington Post.

“In the absence of additional, authoritative 
information from the FBI in the wake of your vague 
disclosure, Congress and the American people are 
left to sift through anonymous leaks from Justice 
Department officials to the press of varying levels of 
detail, reliability, and consistency... The American 
people deserve better than that.”

—SEN. CHARLES GRASSLEY (R-IOWA). chairman of the Senate Judiciary 
Committee, in a letter to Comey on Monday, October 31.

This is part of an ongoing series on the writer’s study 

abroad in Chile.

“65. He had no children, but the people loved him. 66. Like 

the Cross, do we have to come back to Neruda with our knees 
bloodied, our lungs full of holes, our eyes full of tears? 67. 
When our names no longer mean anything, his name will keep 
shining, it will keep projecting over an imaginary literature 
called chilean literature.”

—Roberto Bolaño, “Carnet de baile”

I.
I woke up to the sound of heavy footsteps and a 

conversation in Spanish, using everything at my disposal 
to keep out the light beating down on my eyelids. The 
conversation came closer and grew louder. A door slammed 
shut, and I realized there was no point trying. I raised my 
torso from the couch. I was still wearing my coat. It seemed 
that someone had covered me in a blanket after I passed out 
the night before. It fell off my chest into a bundle around 
my waist. Soft white sunlight shone into the room through 
a window in the ceiling, burning my eyes, and there was a 
young woman I’d never seen before sitting on the adjacent 
couch, staring at me.

“Good morning,” she said in Spanish.
She was blurrier than she ought to have been, so I wiped 

my hand across my eyes, trying to find my 
glasses. I grunted at her and patted blindly at 
the blanket covering my legs, the coffee table 
next to me and the floor underneath the couch.

“Wh … gla … gaf … ”
“What are you looking for … your glasses?”
“Yeah … ”
“They’re on top of your head, man.”
I patted the top of my head and, sure enough, 

my glasses were nestled into my hair. I tried to 
pull them down onto my face and felt a sting as 
a few strands tore out of my scalp. I looked back 
at the girl, sure that I’d never seen her before.

“You’re one of Gustavo’s friends, right?” she 

asked.

“Yeah … uh, Gustavo.”
“Ah, OK. Well, he’s in the bathroom.”
It was 10:30 a.m. I stood up, light-headed. 

Gustavo. We were playing Never Have I Ever 
the night before, but with pisco. Nunca nunca. 
Terrible idea. Never again. I took a few steps, 
wandering in a confused circle. She looked 
concerned or uncomfortable.

“Are you OK?” she asked. “Can I get you 

something … Some water? … An egg?”

I patted myself down; wallet, keys, flip 

phone, pen, passport. Everything in order.

“No, no,” I said. “I’m fine, thanks.”
“Mhmm … OK, well, like I said, Gustavo’s in 

the bathroom. He should be done in a minute.”

Something was wrong … I left my goddamn 

bag at the hostel. I looked around the room 
again, making sure it wasn’t just sitting under 
a couch or a coffee table. It wasn’t. I had to go.

She looked up at me incredulously as I 

shuffled out. The light shone brighter as I 
moved closer to the door and I covered my 
eyes with a forearm as I stepped out onto the 
terrace.

The sky over Valparaíso was gray that 

morning, the air heavy, cold and wet. On my 
left, I could see the harbor sandwiched among 
the rows of houses lining the street that runs 
down off Cerro Concepción, one of the steep 
rolling hills on top of which Valparaíso is 
built. To my right I saw thousands of brightly 
colored houses coating the mountains around 
the bay. The city looked like a box of crayons 
gradually fading away into a cloud of fog and 
mist. Even from there, I could smell a bit of 
ocean. A French-sounding melody echoed off 
the facades around the terrace in disjointed 
phrases; oboe, tuba, accordion. I climbed down 
the narrow stone staircase and passed through 
an iron gate into the cobblestone street. As I 
tried to remember how to get back to the hostel, 
an old man in a beret and brown wool jacket 
watched me stumble over a sudden drop in the 
sidewalk. The street was called Papudo and it 
was somewhere on that enormous hilltop. I was 
hoping nobody stole my bag. I needed my books 
— I was going to Pablo Neruda’s house.

II.
For the better part of an hour I wandered 

up and down the streets running along Cerro 
Concepción, one of the hills that dominates 
the Valparaíso landscape. I eventually found 
the hostel and fished my bag out of the wooden 
storage box underneath my bed. Then, I 
descended 
the 
65-degree-angled 
roadway 

that lead back to Valparaíso proper without 
falling or throwing up, and shuffling down 
increasingly busy streets. I wandered between 
an endless procession of smoking street 
barbecues and sopaipilla carts as stray dogs, 
some of them in polyester sweaters, trotted 
between refurbished electronics stores and 
the old, crag-faced men lining the sidewalk, 
smoking cigarettes in their wool beanies and 
rough leather jackets, looking as though their 
entire lives had been a constant shore leave 
that never quite ended, even after they’d 
finished their careers and disembarked for the 
last time.

As I dragged myself through the city, the 

weight of 10 years of Spanish classes; 15 years 
of defending my interest in socialism to friends 
and family who considered it somewhere 
between 
naive 
and 
psychotic; 
thousands 

of hours of extracurriculars; four years of 
working two jobs alongside 18-credit course 
loads; 5,500 miles on an American Airlines 
plane; an hour on the Santiago subway; four 
hours trapped in a Pullman bus with “The Big 
Bang Theory” playing at full volume out of the 
overhead speakers and a lifetime of plaintive 
sighing over the novels and books of poetry 
hidden in between my textbooks and inside of 
my instrument cases — the combined weight of 
everything that I had ever considered essential 
to myself. All of that seemed to have crawled 
into the pile of books in the messenger bag 
slung across my shoulders and threatening to 
drag me down into a gutter if I should slacken 
under the weight for even a moment. Chief 
among them: Neruda’s “Twenty Love Poems 
and a Song of Despair.”

Born in 1904, Neruda was a Chilean poet and 

politician. His first book of poems, “Twenty 
Love Poems and a Song of Despair,” was the first 
book in Spanish I ever owned. I have a small, 
red, hardcover with pictures of pomegranate 
seeds arranged in even rows across the front. 
On the back, there’s one of those classic 
portraits of Neruda in his wool jacket and 
tweed golf cap, glancing languorously off to 
his right. His hand — a young man’s hand, 
less grizzled than the rest of him — is pressed 
up against the side of his face in an uncanny 
sort of way, somewhere between resting on 
the thing and propping himself up with it. An 
impossibility dressed like a simple gesture, or 
maybe an everyday motion done so well as to 
appear more than what it is. In any case, it’s 
incredibly Neruda.

I spilled a glass of water on the book the day 

after I bought it and spent the majority of that 
evening airing out the pages with my mom’s 
hair dryer. It spent the next seven years on my 
nightstand, where it slowly grew into a species 
of totem that I used in a sort of ritual that, 
in retrospect, seems pretty much completely 
ass-backward. While the rest of my books 
accumulated copious marginalia and words 
translated in superscript, I’d occasionally 
thumb through my copy of the “Love Poems” 
— pristine except for a dark stain left on the 
back cover by the water incident — and read a 
few lines at random, waiting for the day when 
my Spanish or my literary sensibilities were 
developed enough to be able to read entire 

poems without resorting to Google Translate 
while experiencing sudden, sublime flashes of 
working-class spiritual insight with each turn 
of the page. Something about Neruda’s cap told 
me that that was what was supposed to happen 
when you read one of his poems.

But as with any totem, fetish or otherwise 

meaningful object, the version of Neruda’s 
book I had floating around in my head was, 
I was quite convinced, largely disconnected 
from anyone else’s notion of what that book 
should mean, how it should be read, or how it 
should be contextualized within Neruda’s life 
and larger body of work, within the particular 
moment in Chilean history to which it belonged 
and within some grandiose Weltanschauung 
about the nature of the human spirit.

For that matter, the more I thought about 

it, the more it seemed to me that not only 
my relationship with Neruda but the entire 
scenario in which I found myself wondering 
about 
that 
relationship 
was 
somehow 

fundamentally wrong. Rather than sitting in 
the comfort of a modernist poetry course back 
in Ann Arbor, nursing a Lobster Butter coffee 
and talking with a group of like-minded gringo 
collegiate-types about a bunch of poems that 
were little more than words on a page, I was 
instead taking a book I schlepped from a 
Barnes & Noble 5,000 miles away on an absurd 
pilgrimage halfway up a mountain where 
nothing was waiting for me but an old house 
full of jaded tour guides.

III.
I walked through the sultry streets the 

rest of the way, bearing the rain as it began 
and intensified. But just as I thought I might 
need to duck into a mercadito and wait for the 
rain to pass, I turned a corner and saw two 
uniformed guards standing just inside a large, 
open portico. Behind them was a courtyard full 
of people lifting jackets and magazines over 
their heads, making a collective light jog of an 
exodus toward what looked like a chimerical 
lighthouse that had been called forth out of the 
mountainside by a coven of chanting Nerudas. I 
had made it to the poet’s house: La Sebastiana.

In place of the coven, however, Neruda’s 

house is kept from sinking back into the 
mountain by a cushion of cold, hard cash. I 
bought a ticket to the show in the adjacent 
gift shop and made my way toward the house’s 
front door, which led into a foyer full of 
tourists holding electronic audio guides up to 
their ears. There to greet visitors, the museum 
staff seemed more preoccupied with ensuring 
that the audio guides matched each guest’s 
respective lingua franca.

When I was suddenly left out in the wake of 

a group of Japanese tourists, a young woman 
in a black-and-white uniform noticed me, yet to 
receive an audio guide, and asked in heavily-
accented English, “Where are you from?”

I answered in Spanish, “I’m from the U.S., 

but I speak Spanish.”

Standing behind the reception desk, a man in 

his 30s called out in his own accented English, 
“What does he speak?”

The young woman, again in English said, 

“English, but he speaks Spanish.”

The man behind the counter looked at her, 

then me, and then looked for a moment at the 
air between us, his face suddenly consumed by 
the sort of expression you see pass across flight 
attendants’ faces during boarding procedures, 
just after they’ve greeted one passenger and 
just before the next one comes close enough 
to warrant a verbal address; a brief relaxation 
of the muscles of the face that causes the bags 
under their eyes to suddenly appear, palpably, to 
be unmistakably there, as if they were actually 
shouting at you and not simply hanging above 
the flight attendant’s cheekbones like a bit of 
wallpaper.

He then reached down into the audio-guide 

rack and pulled up one of the units, tossing it 
underhand to the young woman next to me, who 
placed it in my hands and told me, in Spanish, 
to enjoy my visit.

I hit play and held the guide up to my 

ear. A different young woman’s voice came 
through the speaker, welcoming me to the La 
Sebastiana House/Museum Guided Audio Tour 
in yet another gradation of accented English. I 
glanced back at the woman who had greeted me 
at the door. She was busy making hand gestures 
at a middle-aged French couple. C’est la vie.

IV.
La Sebastiana looks like a person of extreme 

rotundity, or, really, like a wedding cake. In any 
case, each floor fans out from a spinal column of 
a central stairwell that leads up to a sort of aerie 
where Neruda wrote poems in his trademark 
green ink under the watchful gaze of a massive 
portrait of Walt Whitman. The other levels of 
the house each have their own aesthetic, and 
the audio guide provides a careful description 
of each room. The audio guide’s description 
is a catalogue of the incoherent collection of 
furniture, artworks and knickknacks Neruda 
had amassed during his lifetime followed by a 
series of references to the poet’s work, politics 
and personality quirks that serve as something 
of an explanation for the otherwise chaotic 
assemblage of material.

But of course, an audio guide really doesn’t 

make sense of all of those knickknacks. I 
wonder, in fact, why they even bother trying. 
Whatever relationship the Pablo 
Neruda 

Foundation — which handles the day-to-day 
operations of the museum — might be able to 
draw between Neruda’s life and the random 
assortment of shit in his house simply doesn’t 
reveal any profound new way of reading 
his work or even add much to the body of 
biographical information amassed in the wake 
of his death in the throes of the Chilean coup-
d’état in 1973. The audio guides almost admit 
as much. They explain that Neruda simply 
had an interest in collecting things, and that 
almost all of the ornaments on display in his 
house came from friends and admirers who 
thought of him while wandering through flea 
markets and antique shops around the world. 
The only thing that explains this place is the 
fact that Neruda lived in it, and at the end of 
the day that’s about all that can be gleaned 
from the entire edifice.

But if the guide does manage to account, 

in however slapdash a manner, for Neruda’s 

approach to interior design, it doesn’t do 
anything to change the fact that the layout of 
the place makes for a terribly uncomfortable 
museum experience in the here-and-now. 
The aforementioned stairwell is only wide 
enough for single-direction traffic and the 
house’s sumptuous furnishings leave roughly 
the same amount of room open for any kind of 
walking tour. As a result, the 50-or-so people 
simultaneously wandering around the place 
with nothing to guide them other than a set 
of plastic wands quickly turn into an anxious 
mob that can’t do much of anything other than 
try to get around itself. The place is a literal 
tourist trap, and the cage walls are made out 
of the other tourists walking around the house.

By the time I reached La Sebastiana’s top 

floor, I had spent the better part of an hour 
watching a series of middle-aged gringos inch 
their way down the house’s staircases and 
seriously regretted the 10,000 pesos I had 
blown getting into the place. As I waited in the 
seven-person line crammed into the hallway 
leading into Neruda’s study, I was already 
dreading the walk back down to the ground 
floor and busied myself trying to calculate 
the number of sopaipillas I could have bought 
(upward of 20) instead of coming here in the 
first place.

After flattening myself up against a wall to 

allow an old German woman with a walker to 
shimmy past, there was finally enough space 
in the room for me to step in. A four-foot-tall 
portrait of Walt Whitman stared out at me from 
one side of the room. Next to the portrait, there 
was a copy of a map of the Americas drawn 
up by a Dutchman in the 16th or 17th century, 
complete with caricatures of the indigenous 
peoples populating Chile and Argentina and a 
couple of sea monsters floating around in the 
Pacific. I didn’t bother turning on the audio 
guide.

I shuffled past Neruda’s writing desk and 

stood next to the window, looking down over 
the hills of Valparaiso and out to the harbor 
and the Pacific Ocean stretching out into the 
distance. The four or five people crowded next 
to me were all looking through the window 
with the same sort of exhausted expression 
on their faces. They had given up on the audio 
guides, too.

As I looked over at the them, I wondered 

whether they had come to Neruda’s house 
looking for the same sort of things I had come 
there for. In all honesty, though, my reasons 
for going there were making less and less sense 
with each passing moment. I figured that 
people go on a pilgrimage — even a made-up 
pilgrimage like the one I was on — to remind 
themselves why they continue to believe the 
things they do; to renew their sense of right 
and wrong and remind themselves why they 
keep observing the rites and rituals prescribed 
by their holy books, no matter how out of touch 
with reality those ideas seem. If a holy site were 
anything, it seemed to me, it ought to be a place 
where those beliefs still made something like 
rational sense. A place without compromises 
and without hypocrites, where nobody cuts 
corners and nobody has to cut corners to keep 
true to their dreams and ideals.

I looked back at Walt Whitman. I suppose 

I wanted him to be crying, or something 
miraculous like that. He wasn’t. And this wasn’t 
any kind of shrine. I had gone on pilgrimage to 
a goddamn gift shop.

V.
As I sidled back down the stairs toward 

the rainstorm waiting outside, I wondered to 
myself why I thought I’d find anything other 
than I did here.

Before coming to Valparaiso, I had, on a few 

different occasions, talked about Neruda with 
my host family and Chilean friends. As I should 
have expected, none of them read Neruda with 
any kind of regularity. After all, nobody reads. 
Period. And even fewer people read poetry, even 
when it’s poetry by a Nobel-winner. Even in 
asking people what they thought about Neruda, 
I got the vibe that I was coming across as a bit 
of an ass. I mean, shit, imagine a tourist coming 
up to you off the street and expecting you to 
have an opinion about Walt Whitman. Even if 
you did have one, chances are you’d probably 
be on your way to work and want nothing more 
than for that guy to get out of your face so 
you could get back to your Facebook feed and 
the Drake pouring out of your earbuds for the 
hundred millionth time, slowly demolishing 
your ear drums.

The few Chileans I met who did have a 

serious opinion about Neruda pretty much 
invariably hated him. They thought he was a 
self-aggrandizing cornball at best and, if you 
really wanted to get into it, they thought he was 
a chauvinist who served as a mouthpiece for 
precisely the sort of machista, heteronormative 
Marxism that the Latin American Left has 
been trying to disassemble for the last 20-some 
years.

In other words, they saw Neruda for what he 

was: an old man from a bygone era, a latter-day 
Romantic whose utopias were an escape from 
an antiquated set of problems. A quaint sort of 
antique, maybe, like the ships in bottles and 
imported silk screens and Coptic tapestries 
lining the walls of his house. But, in any case, 
an antique that’s better off left hanging on the 
wall.

When I finally made it back down to the 

ground floor, the guy standing at the front 
desk had his forehead in his hands. He was 
massaging his temples and sweating around his 
collar. I left my audio guide on the counter and 
stepped out the door back into the rain.

I stood outside the gift shop for a moment and 

watched the steady stream of tourists flowing 
through the door. The guards over by the front 
gate were smoking cigarettes under their 
umbrellas. Over to my left, a few more tourists 
had gathered at the edge of a concrete overlook. 
They were speaking Portuguese and trying to 
figure out how their knock-off selfie stick was 
going to work with one of their iPhones.

I took my glasses in my hand and did my best 

to dry off the rainwater with the hem of my 
coat. I looked down toward the harbor, which 
seemed just as far away as when I arrived. I 
glanced at my watch. There was a bus back to 
Santiago in 45 minutes. But I didn’t need to 
rush. The busses left every two hours.

THE HOUSE OF 
PABLO: A Journey 

to the Home of 
Pablo Neruda

By Adam DePollo, Daily Arts Writer


S

he lay on her side with her head on the armrest, her 
angular shoulder wedged into the square corner of 
the couch. She was so small, you nearly missed her 

with a quick glance at the living room. But if you stared 
long enough, you could see the rise and fall of her chest. 
If you listened close enough, you could hear the wheezing 
of her lungs.

I remember a lot of things: the things you see in 

movies, the things you read in novels. Her hair came out 
in stages — sticking to the brush in small strokes at first, 
then falling out in handfuls to fill the bucket we kept by 
the sink. She never threw up — at least that I knew of — 
but she hacked as if to turn the walls of her intestines 
inside out. Her nails chipped and turned yellow, then 
blue, then black. She lost her appetite and I watched her 
ribs protrude from her skin one at a time.

My mom was diagnosed with breast cancer and lung 

cancer when I was in eighth grade.

I remember coming home to my parents sitting at the 

dining table. The air so still, I could see the specks of dust 
hovering in space.

I didn’t fully understand it then, what it meant to live 

with a disease. She had surgery on her breast, before the 
radiation and chemo. They removed a quarter of her lung 
to rid the tumor, and she was left with a gashing scar that 
ran down her back — a slightly pinker, second spine. She 
fully recovered a year later, and by then I was accustomed 
to packing lunches for my dad, my brother and myself, as 
well as cooking dinner, cleaning the house and waiting 
for clothes to dry while learning algebra.

My eighth grade was different. I got little sleep, which 

I now think trained me well for this rigorous college 
curriculum. I was forced to grow up, forced to see pain 
and feel the fear of death lurking in its peripheries.

Maybe it was a combination of this fear and 

independence that led me to attend boarding school in 
another country and subsequently leave for college far 
away.

I know it sounds ironic — why leave? How could I. 
I started dancing when I was three years old and 

dreamed of becoming a professional dancer in a Chicago-
based contemporary dance company. When my family 
moved from California to Japan after fourth grade, I was 
shocked by the culture but also the urgency I felt to return 
to the United States. I wanted to pursue this dream that 
formed over time, crystalline images that were so clear 
they were reflective.

My mom supported me most. Dreaming isn’t easy for 

everyone, she used to tell me. I was lucky to have a dream, 
to want something so badly I could change my lifestyle. I 
could travel across the globe. So I did.

After boarding school in North Carolina, an ACL tear 

and an awakening for a career shift, I chose to attend 
the University of Michigan to double major in dance and 
neuroscience and pursue a career path in medicine.

I was entirely consumed by my happiness, with the 

feeling of finally finding my niche and belonging to a 
university-sized world that I could pin my own. This is 
probably why the news of the recurrence of lung cancer 
hit me hard.

Stage 4 lung cancer — not surgically removable or 

treatable with radiation or chemo like last time.

My mom got the news of the recurrence in October. 

I may have been at a football game, I may have been 
drunk off cheap wine, I may have been locked in the 

library thinking midterms were a series of metastatically 
depressing days. My parents waited to tell me. It wouldn’t 
have been right to tell you over the phone, when you 
couldn’t see my face and know that I’m OK, my mom 
rationalized.

I didn’t understand how fighting cancer twice wasn’t 

enough.

I didn’t understand how someone who never smoked 

a cigarette and cooked every single meal from scratch 
could receive this sort of punishment from life. I didn’t 
understand why it always had to be her, why it couldn’t be 
the chainsmoker across the street or the serial killer who 
got away — someone who deserved it, someone not her.

How could a mom so selfless, who let her daughter 

leave home get this in return? How could someone make 
it their life mission to give and teach compassion and 
receive an ultimatum: You fight this war in the front lines 
or you die. I didn’t understand. I still don’t understand.

I would have taken her place if I could. But honestly, I 

don’t think I could. Say genome editing allowed my mom 
and I to swap our DNA helices — I could not take her 
place. I wish I could, I wanted to say I could, but I was 
too scared. Despite my astronomical feelings of guilt and 
resentment for the spontaneous recurrence of malignant 
cells, I wasn’t brave enough. I could not even begin to 
comprehend the fear she felt going to bed and waking up 
to, day after day.

And you know what the hardest part was? That she 

was still her — she was still happier than me, she was still 
more positive and giving than I could ever be. Watching 
her, with just three quarters of regular lung capacity, 
taking oral drugs to suppress tumor growth that were 
nothing short of poisonous, hurt.

If she could wake up in the morning and smile, still 

give something positive to the world, there was nothing 
I couldn’t do.

On New Year’s Day, I remember sitting at home with 

my mom. Because Japan is 13 hours ahead of Michigan, 
my Snapchat and Instagram were exploding with sparkly 
cocktail dresses and shiny cocktail glasses. Champagne 

corks hitting ceilings, people throwing kisses like confetti.

I remember sitting at the dining table, my mom sitting 

in front of me. The medication managed to stop the 
tumor’s growth but came with strong side effects. Her 
nails were destroyed, her fingers cut and the skin on her 
back covered in hives. I helped her apply the antibiotic 
ointment on her back every night to places she couldn’t 
reach. I covered the red bumps with the white cream like 
snow covering mountain tops.

For the first time, it occurred to me that my happiness 

fueled my mom. That I, pursuing my passions, inching 
toward my dream and happiness, was her greatest dream. 
That maybe, just maybe, the best thing I could do was 
focus on myself and my aspirations, because the sight 
of me refusing to quit somehow was a reflection on her 
relentlessness and willpower — I am living proof that she 
will not lose this war she is fighting.

Nov. 7 marks my mom’s two-year anniversary of the 

start of this medication. The tumor has not grown and 
that is what I am grateful for every morning. Every couple 
of weeks, she goes to the Kobe City Medical Center to 
get checked. Her lungs, her breasts and her blood. Every 
couple of weeks, my stomach drops and my intestines 
feel as though they are getting wrung out dry. But every 
couple of weeks, I am reminded of how lucky I am.

It is so easy to get caught in the drama of college, the 

friendships that fail, the relationships that disintegrate 
and the grades that teeter on a pinpoint. I took a cancer 
seminar last year and read cases of medications failing 
after long-term use. I fear that this balance of tumor 
suppression and growth could be shattered any day.

But I think this fear is what drives me forward. It is 

what tells me to appreciate today for what it is, to remind 
the people I love that I love them for who they have 
made me become and inspire me to be, and to never take 
anything for granted. I hope that someday I will have the 
kindness and strength my mom carries with her every 
day — that one day, I can embrace the future the way she 
embraces tomorrow.

Learning to Love Myself in Safe Spaces

A

t the beginning of the summer, I went to my mid-
dle school for a Girl Scouts reunion. The school 
remained exactly as I remembered it (including the 

stench of hormone-fueled hysteria clinging to the walls), 
except there were new stickers on the door of many class-
rooms. Those rooms were designated as “safe spaces” for 
LGBTQ individuals — meaning that, as a school, these 
classrooms have a zero-tolerance policy for homophobic 
and transphobic aggression toward students who identify 
as LGBTQ. As a queer girl who was called a dyke too often 
in that very building, I held back a scornful laugh.

In middle school, I learned everything was fair game 

for merciless gossip, from who you ate lunch with to the 
length of your pants. There was never a right answer. And 
worse, I could not exempt myself from critique like I had 
in the past by keeping things to myself. Criticism came to 
me without so much as an invitation. You would be pretty 
if you, like, straightened your hair and wore makeup!

And then I started getting called a dyke by lanky, acne-

ridden 13-year-olds wearing malicious smirks. Unbe-
known to them, I had already begun to question what 

was “wrong” with me. To be sure, gossiping about cute 
boys in my class was a favorite pastime of mine since first 
grade, but there was more happening beneath the surface. 
I remember finally bringing my mom’s attention to the 
gorgeous models in shampoo commercials I fawned over 
in third grade, and by fifth grade the hot, heavy sensation 
that would stir within me when I saw bombshell musi-
cians like Christina Aguilera perform in provocative cos-
tumes. I thought everyone did.

My devoutly Catholic and Latina mom always shut 

off the TV or shielded my eyes during the movies when 
a straight couple would kiss on screen. She would also 
remind me of how I was going to grow up to marry a good 
man and have beautiful children like God intended. At 13, 
I felt like I was going to have to choose between this con-
fusing future and turning into an angry, buzz-cut-sport-
ing lesbian like the ones I saw on TV. I didn’t know what 
to make of myself, and these stereotypes didn’t help.

I was very hurt by God for giving me a sure-

ly damned, defective brain that couldn’t pray away 
my lust for women on the one hand, while having 

crushes on boys in class just like “other girls” on the 
other. I was mortified that people thought I was a les-
bian in spite of sharing which boys I had crushes on. My 
attempt to keep my feelings for girls to myself failed with-
out having said a word.

In middle school, I developed adjustment disorder, or 

situational depression, which is a short-term disorder 
that arises when you can’t handle major changes in your 
life. I felt numb to my core and stayed in bed for entire 
weekends due to emotional exhaustion, and I never con-
sidered letting my parents know about what was happen-
ing at school because I felt they would be angry at me 
deep down, too.

On the last day of seventh grade my favorite teacher 

pulled me aside into her empty classroom. She hugged me 
and, out of the blue, said I was strong and courageous. 
She didn’t say why, but I knew. She was acknowledging 
the bullying I endured. I thanked her out of respect, but 
I felt a cold apathy. Her words felt as cheap as the paper 
these new “safe space” stickers were printed on. She had 
revealed that she knew I was being bullied but did noth-
ing to stop it. She was expressing her sympathy after 
being a bystander over something that tore me up inside.

If these new “safe space” stickers had been posted 

throughout my school six years ago, would she have done 
something then? Times have certainly changed.

Once I got to the University of Michigan, I immedi-

ately sought help. I am very thankful for the University’s 
Spectrum Center — a designated safe space on campus 
— where I was guided with nothing less than compas-
sion and self-affirmation. Professionals there moved me 
to tears with supportive smiles and explained to me the 
facts of bisexuality. In the Spectrum Center’s first-year 
student initiative program, I met other queer freshmen 
who showed me I was not alone on this journey to self-
discovery. I saw I could thrive on campus in the LGBTQ 
community. Through the center’s mentorship program, 
I was mentored by another bisexual girl who was in the 
School of Social Work. She let me confide in her, like a 
cousin who had already been in my shoes. As a fellow 
Catholic, she convinced me I would meet someone who 
would make me happy regardless of the inner conflict I 
currently feel, helping me stop my self-loathing and live 
my truth. I learned who I was in safe spaces.

Heated columns criticize “safe spaces” at universities, 

claiming they baby college students by isolating minori-
ties and infringing on free speech. Critics argue that these 
havens shelter marginalized communities from the hard-
ships of the real world. To be sure, too much of a good 
thing can be a bad thing. But for many in the LGBTQ com-
munity, college provides the first time one can openly 
explore and embrace their true identities. It gave me the 
courage prove to myself that all of me is real and wor-
thy of love, no matter how much those close to me would 
rather I pretend this part doesn’t exist. And there is noth-
ing coddling about that.

Last weekend, I photographed Mud Bowl — a fundraiser for C.S. Mott 
Children’s Hospital. The atmosphere was unlike any other sport I’ve 
shot before; spectators ranged from tailgaters, to alumni to Greek life 

members, all cheering on their favorite team. Being on the sidelines was 

nothing short of chaotic, and I got mud splashed all over me as I tried 
to capture the action, atmosphere and fights breaking out. It reminded 

me that the spectators and atmosphere are just as important as the 
athletes and telling the story of the game. That’s why Mudbowl easily 

claims the spot as my favorite event I’ve shot on campus.
