About 
100 
students, 
faculty 
and 
community 
members came to Rackham 
Auditorium 
on 
Wednesday 
afternoon to hear Charles 
W. 
Mills, 
a 
distinguished 
philosophy professor at the 
City University of New York, 
speak on the concept of racial 
justice and why it has been 
historically ignored within 
the field of philosophy.
Mills was featured as the 
guest speaker of the 2019-
2020 
Tanner 
Lecture 
on 
Human Values sponsored by 

the University of Michigan 
Department 
of 
Philosophy. 
The 
Tanner 
Lectures 
are 
funded by Obert Clark Tanner, 
a late philosophy professor 
who hoped the series would 
contribute 
to 
an 
ongoing 
dialogue on human morality. 
The University was the first 
to host a Tanner Lecture and 
is one of nine institutions 
worldwide to participate in 
the tradition.
University President Mark 
Schlissel lauded the lecture 
series as an opportunity to 
consider 
important 
issues 
demanding our intellectual 
attention. 

“With Dr. Mills, we have a 
pioneering scholar who has 
added 
new 
dimensions 
of 
thought to the examination of 
human values,” Schlissel said. 
Mills opened by framing his 
lecture with the question of 
why racial justice has been so 
rarely addressed in Western, 
and particularly American, 
political 
philosophy 
when 
justice is a main idea of 
debate within the discipline. 
To lay the groundwork of his 
argument, 
Mills 
explained 
the 
theories 
of 
classical 
liberalism, a set of ideals 
from the Enlightenment era 
advocating for free markets, 

rule of law, private property, 
individual 
freedom 
and 
equality based on free trade.
As Mills explained, classical 
liberalism was the dominant 
political ideology of modern 
Western 
countries 
including 
the United States prior to the 
20th century. Classical liberals 
claimed to break from oppressive, 
undemocratic political systems 
such as feudalism, a hierarchical 
medieval-era system in which 
peasants worked on the lands of 
nobility, and absolutism, a belief 
in the absolute power of a king 
who owned by divine right.

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-NINE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Volunteering in a clinical 
setting 
is 
an 
important 
part of pre-med students’ 
medical school applications. 
Each semester, there is a 
high demand for positions at 
the University of Michigan 
Hospital, the biggest and 
most 
accessible 
hospital 
on campus, with slots for 
attending 
an 
information 
session filling up within five 
minutes. 
After 
attending 
an 
information 
session, 

students 
are 
offered 
an 
interview 
on 
a 
lottery 
basis and then assigned a 
volunteer 
position 
based 
on their top three choices 
and time availability. Some 
students told The Daily they 
have found this process to 
be too long and sometimes 
frustrating. 
LSA 
sophomore 
Sadie 
Mauger said she has applied 
twice to volunteer through 
Michigan 
Medicine, 
but 
did not get an interview 
despite 
attending 
an 
information 
session. 
According 
to 
Mauger, 

the problem lies not only 
with capacity but with the 
process itself. She said the 
hospital was unclear when 
sharing 
interview 
times 
over the past year and was 
assigning time slots before 
people had finalized their 
schedules. 
“I 
think 
the 
most 
frustrating thing is that 
there 
is 
no 
seniority 
in 
terms 
of 
volunteer 
preference,” Mauger said. 
“I am applying to medical 
school, and I need that 
experience to apply, and I 
know that there are a lot of 

freshmen that are already 
volunteering, so seniority 
is something that would 
help the process.”
Though 
first-semester 
freshmen are not eligible 
to apply, the hospital does 
not 
have 
a 
preference 
among the other students 
during the hiring process. 
Returning 
volunteers 
have first pick at available 
positions at the beginning 
of each semester before 
new 
volunteers 
are 
registered.

Admin was aware of 
Philbert complaints, 
Free Press reports

University of Michigan 
administrators and faculty 
were 
aware 
of 
several 
complaints about Provost 
Martin Philbert while he 
served 
in 
various 
roles 
within 
the 
School 
of 
Public Health, according 
to The Detroit Free Press. 
Philbert 
was 
placed 
on 
paid 
administrative 
leave 
on 
Wednesday, 
Jan. 22 following several 
allegations 
of 
sexual 
misconduct.
Thomas Komorowski, a 
former research associate 
for 
the 
University 
who 
worked in Philbert’s lab at 
the School of Public Health 
in 2003, claimed in a 2004 
lawsuit he was wrongfully 
terminated because of an 
inappropriate relationship 
between Philbert and a 
female researcher. Philbert 
denied that Komorowski 
was laid off due to his 
relationship 
with 
the 
female 
researcher 
and 
claimed 
Komorowski’s 
grant aid had run out.
In 2005, the University 

settled the lawsuit for an 
unknown amount.
The Detroit Free Press 
reported that more than 
20 
women 
have 
filed 
complaints 
of 
sexual 

misconduct 
against 

Philbert, 
according 
to 
anonymous 
sources. 
In 
2009, when Philbert was 
leading research at the 
School of Public Health, 
an 
anonymous 
woman 
notified 
her 
supervisor 
in the dean’s office that 
Philbert 
had 
sexually 
harassed her. 
Philbert 
was 
one 
of 
several 
candidates 
who 
applied 
to 
be 
dean 
of 
the 
School 
of 
Public 
Health in 2010. When the 
search committee moved 
Philbert’s 
candidacy 
forward, 
an 
anonymous 
email 
accusing 
the 
committee of manipulating 
the process was sent to the 
leader of the committee 
and copied to the entire 
school. Then-Provost Phil 
Hanlon replied with an 
email to the school.

The 
impeachment 
trial 
of President Donald Trump 
has generated much debate 
across the political spectrum. 
The Daily spoke with several 
conservative 
students 
about their viewpoints on 
impeachment. 
On Jan. 15, 2019, the House 
of Representatives filed two 
impeachment articles against 
Trump, 
accusing 
him 
of 
abusing his power as president 
and obstructing Congress. In 
the following two weeks, U.S. 
senators filled the chamber to 
conduct an impeachment trial 
against 
Trump, 
ultimately 
voting to acquit the president 
of 
all 
charges. 
The 
vote 
was along party lines, with 
the exception of Sen. Mitt 
Romney, R-Utah, who voted 
that the president should be 
charged with one of the two 
counts. 
The filing of the two articles 
came after a whistleblower 
in the White House filed a 
complaint on Aug. 12 to the 
Senate and House Intelligence 
Committees, 
claiming 
the 
president used his position 
to get a foreign country to 
meddle 
in 
the 
2020 
U.S. 
presidential election. In a 
phone call, Trump allegedly 
asked the president of Ukraine 
to 
investigate 
disproven 
corruption allegations against 
Democratic 
presidential 
candidate Joe Biden and his 
son, Hunter Biden. 
Austin McIntosh, Michigan 
campus 
correspondent 
for 
Campus 
Reform 
and 
LSA 

senior, said the president did 
no wrongdoing and therefore 
should 
not 
have 
been 
impeached at all. 
“When 
I 
read 
the 
transcript, I didn’t see any 
(wrongdoings),” 
McIntosh 
said. “I would say (Trump) 
didn’t (commit any crimes). 
(Trump) didn’t even begin 
to ask about (looking into 
Biden), what he did tell him 
about was ‘Look, we found 
out that there seems to be 
some corruption going on. It’s 
your administrators or your 
advisers, and I think you need 
to find the root of that.’ I don’t 
think Donald Trump saying 
‘Hey, there’s corruption in 
your government, figure it 
out,’ I don’t think that’s so bad 
or anything.’”
Nicholas Schuler, freshman 
chair of College Republicans 
and 
LSA 
freshman, 
said 
though Trump did have a 
phone call with the Ukrainian 
president, he believes there 
was nothing said that would 
be worthy of impeachment. 
This is a view supported by 
many within the Republican 
party. Though one in three 
Republicans 
believe 
that 
Trump 
may 
have 
done 
something wrong, 86 percent 
believe he was not deserving 
of removal from office. 
“So we know that he had a 
phone call with the Ukrainian 
president, and we also know 
that aid was later cut to 
Ukraine,” Schuler said. “I 
think anything in between 
that we don’t know. There was 
no explicit wrongdoing by the 
president and certainly not 
something impeachable.”
Lincoln Ballew, president 

of 
Young 
Americans 
for 
Freedom and LSA junior, said 
she believes the impeachment 
trial isn’t a pressing issue for 
many Americans.
“I don’t think very many 
people care about it or pay 
attention because it’s really 
complicated and there hasn’t 
been very much transparency 
with the issue,” Ballew said. 
“It’s been really hard for the 
public to follow what’s been 
going on, so I don’t think many 
people care.”
Voters 
in 
Michigan 
are 
divided over their thoughts 
on impeachment. Michigan 
is a key battleground state in 
the 2020 election, and a state 
Trump won in 2016. Trump 
has made two campaign visits 
to the state since January 
2019, and Vice President Mike 
Pence is scheduled to make an 
appearance in Troy at the end 
of the month.
Another common argument 
voiced by those who spoke 
with The Daily was that the 
process 
of 
impeachment 
should be fundamentally non-
partisan and should remain 
based on the facts. McIntosh 
also 
said 
senators 
should 
use their voting power to 
reflect how their constituents 
feel about impeaching the 
president. 
“There’s 
congressmen 
or 
senators who feel like they 
shouldn’t be afraid of the 
backlash from the right — 
you’re supposed to represent 
your people,” McIntosh said. 
“You should represent your 
base, and if a certain base feels 
a certain way on the president, 
that’s how you should vote.” 
Since 
the 
conclusion 
of 

impeachment, 
many 
have 
speculated 
about 
how 
the 
impeachment 
trial 
will 
affect the 2020 election. LSA 
junior Caroline Martin, vice 
president 
of 
outreach 
for 
WeListen, said she believes 
the impeachment trial did not 
have much effect on the 2020 
election. 
“I think the impeachment 
proceedings 
are 
timed 
very well,” Martin said. “I 
don’t 
necessarily 
know 
if 
they would have impacted 
my personal view of this 
particular president because 
your opinions of him before, 
whether or not you agree with 
him or disagree with him, 
wouldn’t change as much after 
hearing some of the evidence; 
you would be more inclined to 
stick with what you already 
believe.”
Regina 
Egan, 
communications director of 
College Democrats, also wrote 
in a message to The Daily that 
the organization believes the 
impeachment 
trial 
shows 
voters in the 2020 election 
that 
the 
Democrats 
are 
steadfast in their commitment 
to the truth. 
“In fact, (the impeachment 
trial) shows that Democrats 
value the integrity of a trial 
and are willing to deliver 
on 
their 
fundamental 
responsibility to the American 
people, the majority of whom 
wanted 
witnesses,” 
Egan 
wrote. 
“What 
voters 
will 
remember in November is the 
Democrats’ pursuit of truth 
and a fair trial.”

Alves 
said 
having 
worked in the legal sector 
in New York, in politics 
at the White House and 
at 
fintech 
startups 
in 
Silicon Valley, she’s found 
the 
hardest 
problems 
facing the financial world 
require different types of 
knowledge.
“The hardest problems 
to solve are ones that 
require people to have a 
perspective from different 
sectors, and that’s how I 
thought about my careers … 
I needed to have experience 
in all those places and 
speak those languages and 
understand those cultures 
to be able to bring them 
together and solve really 
thorny problems,” Alves 
said.
Harris also spoke on 
regulating U.S. financial 
institutions and challenges 
in the new age of fintech, 
where 
technologies 
involving 
machine 
learning 
and 
artificial 
intelligence 
have 
the 
potential 
to 
influence 
finances. Recent changes 
and 
the 
incorporation 
of 
technology 
into 
the 
financial 
industry 
have 
drawn 
attention 
to 
systematic 
issues 
and 
require policy innovation.

“Before, 
fintech 
data 
was just your transaction 
data … but now everything 
is financial information,” 
Harris said. “You take Uber 
or Lyft, where you went 
and at what time is now 
tied up with a financial 
service, 
and 
payment 
apps 
— 
everything 
has 
become financial data and 
everything 
has 
become 
data on which financial 
decisions about you can 
be made. The trick is, as a 
regulator, as a policymaker, 
is how do you stay close 
enough 
to 
industry 
to 
help drive an affirmative 
agenda, to help catch the 
no-no’s when they happen, 
but not stifle innovation?”
Harris said the highly 
personal nature of money 
and 
finance 
and 
the 
unknown 
role 
fintech 
companies 
will 
play 
in 
possibly perpetrating or 
amending 
mistrust 
in 
financial institutions. 
“(Finance) is emotional, 
it’s personal, it’s stressful, 
it’s all of these things and 
you’re basically expected 
to 
just 
hand 
it 
over, 
whether it’s the money 
itself or it’s our login,” 
Harris said. “When fintech 
first came along they were 
like, ‘We’re not the big 
financial institutions.’ ... 
But that also used to be the 
case, sort of, with Google 
and 
Facebook, 
so 
we’ll 

see how this changes. I 
think we start off feeling 
trustworthy and become 
less so over time.” 
Alves 
discussed 
some 
of her motivations behind 
organizing this dialogue. 
Alves said the event took 
place as part of diversity 
week 
at 
the 
Business 
School, 
which 
aims 
to 
bring awareness to key 
issues regarding access to 
financial institutions and 
trust in them. 
“I thought of why I 
wanted to do an event on 
financial 
inclusion 
and 
what did I want to learn 
more about and what did I 
also want my peers to hear 
about in terms of financial 
inclusion,” 
Alves 
said. 
“Some of the main points 
(were) trusting financial 
institutions 
and 
getting 
traditional banks or bigger 
financial 
institutions 
to 
actually 
serve 
these 
underserved communities 
and populations.”
Harris 
elaborated 
on 
the 
potential 
for 
fintech 
companies 
to 
help decrease the cost of 
providing 
traditionally 
“underbanked” people, or 
those 
without 
frequent 
access 
to 
mainstream 
financial 
services, 
with 
access to credit as well 
as educating people on 
financial health. 
“Historically, 
people 

have said it’s too costly to 
serve 
those 
populations 
because they don’t create 
enough revenue for the 
institution,” Harris said. 
“Fintech 
sort 
of 
came 
about with the promise of 
we’re going to use tech to 
drive down the cost and 
therefore that ratio will 
be going back and we’ll be 
better able to serve these 
people.”
Sanchez-Burks said the 
subject matter of the event 
was interesting, noting the 
interdisciplinary aspect of 
the event.
“There’s a lot of work 
being done in the studio 
around financial inclusion 
and credit … to focus it 
on fintech and financial 
inclusion, the dangers and 
possibilities have got to be 
very interesting,” Sanchez-
Burks said. “We want to be 
this hub for the University 
of innovation and partner 
with 
other 
units 
on 
campus.”
Harris 
answered 
questions from the crowd 
of 
students, 
alumni 
and 
faculty 
addressing 
topics including fintech’s 
durability during a possible 
economic recession.
“A big question in the 
fintech 
community 
is 
what’s going to happen 
when there’s a recession,” 
Harris said. “We just don’t 
know yet because we’ve 

only seen fintech in this 
one economic cycle.”
Harris also addressed 
the potential to use fintech 
to analyze wealth gaps in 
the U.S. and the role that 
race plays in accessing 
credit 
and 
financial 
resources. 
“Because of the history 
of this country around 
race, there are wealth gaps, 
income gaps that tend to, 
themselves, 
perpetuate,” 
Harris said. “I’m hopeful 
that 
part 
of 
what 
technology will allow us to 
explore is our conceptions 
about this.”
Business 
freshman 
Isabella 
Conti 
attended 
the event and expressed 
her interest in fintech, 
considering its potential to 
increase financial access in 
underserved communities. 
“(The 
talk) 
brought 
up a lot of things that 
I’d never thought about, 
with the future of finance 
and technology and how 
that 
intersects,” 
Conti 
said. “My family is Latino 
and my parents are both 
immigrants, so how this 
could help underprivileged 
people and demographics 
was 
really 
interesting 
to me, as I know a lot of 
people who could benefit.”

While Mills said liberalism 
is a great idea in theory, he 
noted the ideals of it have not 
been carried out in practice. 
He 
noted 
freedom 
and 
equality have exclusively been 
the rights of certain members 
of society, while others, such 
as people of color and women, 
have been left out. Mills said 
the 
conventional 
narrative 
portrays 
modern 
Western 
society to be more egalitarian 
than it truly is.
“We need to remember 
most 
Western 
European 
states at one time or another 
had 
empires 
— 
British, 
French, 
Dutch, 
Spanish, 
Portuguese, 
Belgian 
— 
in 
which 
non-Europeans, 
indigenous peoples, in some 
cases, African slaves were 
systemically 
subordinate,” 
Mills said. “Together, these 
Western 
countries 
ruled 
undemocratically 
over 
the 
vast majority of humanity.”
With these considerations 
in mind, Mills said classical 
liberalism 
has 
historically 
been both a “patriarchal” 
liberalism, 
supported 
by 
male 
gender 
domination, 
and 
“racial” 
liberalism, 
underwritten by white racial 
domination. Yet, Mills said 
the philosophy discipline has 
done little to address these 
historical biases.
According to Mills, part 
of the problem with the 
philosophy field is that it is 
predominantly 
white. 
He 
acknowledged his claim is 
controversial as some say 
philosophy isn’t affected by 
race because it supposedly 
theorizes about the general 
human condition. However, 
Mills 
said 
this 
argument 
misses the experiences and 
issues specific to people of 
color. 
Mills said a consequence of 
non-diverse academia is that 
the education system ignores 

certain aspects of history. 
For example, Mills told the 
audience that Japan, one of 
the few non-white countries 
in the post-World War I 
diplomatic council the League 
of Nations, advocated for a 
racial equality clause in the 
Treaty of Versailles. However, 
the other countries rejected 
the proposal.
When 
Mills 
asked 
the 
audience how many people 
knew about the unsuccessful 
racial equality clause, only a 
handful of people raised their 
hands.
“This is a prestigious, very 
well-known 
university,” 
Mills said. “You need to ask 
yourself, what does this say 
about the education system 
… and the broader history of 
colonialism?”
Mills 
spent 
much 
of 
his 
talk 
criticizing 
the 
theories of John Rawls, a 
20th-century 
American 
political philosopher. In his 
book “A Theory of Justice,” 
Rawls proposed the idea of 
distributive 
social 
justice, 
which 
expanded 
upon 
the social contract theory 
developed by Enlightenment 
thinkers 
John 
Locke 
and 
Thomas Hobbes.
According 
to 
social 
contract theory, individuals 
in a state agree to give up their 
freedoms and be governed 
by the state in exchange 
for security. Rawls added 
onto 
this 
theory 
through 
the thought experiment of 
a “veil of ignorance,” which 
hypothesizes that a person, 
before they are born, has the 
opportunity to create an ideal 
society. 
However, the person has no 
knowledge of who they will 
be in this world. Because they 
do not know if they will be a 
part of the privileged class 
or not, Rawls claims people 
will create an objectively just 
society out of self-interest in 
case they are born without 
certain privileges.
According to Mills, Rawls’s 

theory does not apply to the 
U.S. because Rawls sees the 
country as one with racism 
instead of as an inherently 
racist 
society. 
However, 
Mills said Western societies 
have historically been racist 
because race affects the basic 
structure of these societies, 
from the economy to the 
main 
political 
and 
social 
institutions.
Instead 
of 
theorizing 
about what an ideal world 
would 
look 
like, 
Mills 
believed racial justice should 
consider and acknowledge 
racist histories and focus on 
corrective justice. According 
to Mills, corrective justice 
entails 
actions 
such 
as 
radical 
revision 
of 
the 
prison-industrial 
complex 
and 
perhaps 
even 
a 
consideration of reparations. 
Mill’s 
revision 
of 
the 
Rawls’s “veil of ignorance” 
thought experiment, under 
the 
lens 
of 
corrective 
justice, 
would 
aim 
to 
repair 
historically 
racist 
structures. 
“As a white person, you 
ask yourself, I’m doing this 
thought experiment … let’s 
say I’m a Black woman in a 
ghetto in South Side Chicago, 
or let’s say I’m a Latino 
somewhere in southwestern 
United States or I’m a Native 
American on a reservation,” 
Mills said. “What structures, 
what policies would I want to 
see put in place to make sure 
as much as I can that I’m not 
radically handicapped?”
Following his talk, Mills 
opened the floor to questions 
from the audience. 
The first person to speak in 
the Q&A portion claimed Ann 
Arbor is a reverse racist and 
reverse sexist community that 
discriminates against white 
males like himself. When 
people started clapping after 
he said he planned to leave 
the country because of this 
discrimination, 
he 
became 
angry and left the event. 
Several audience members 

asked Mills how to incorporate 
discussions of racial justice 
into 
the 
classroom, 
both 
in college courses and in 
secondary 
schooling. 
Mills 
said efforts should be made 
not only to have dedicated 
courses to race theory but also 
to center considerations of 
identity.
“See how race can be 
incorporated 
into 
the 
curriculum … because it’s 
not as if you’re distorting 
the material,” Mills said. 
“Because 
race 
permeates 
everything.”
Rackham 
student 
Gabrielle Peterson and the 
rest of the Racism Lab, an 
interdisciplinary 
group 
of scholars, attended the 
event 
together. 
She 
said 
Mills’s point about the lack 
of 
diversity 
in 
academia 
resonated 
with 
many 
of 
them. 
“Mills’s 
discussion 
of 
the 
demographics 
within 
research 
bodies 
in 
philosophy 
that 
influence and inform the 
misrepresentations of Black 
people and other minorities 
was extremely helpful in 
rethinking 
and 
reflecting 
on our own experiences in 
our respective disciplines,” 
Peterson said. 
Jessica 
Castellani, 
a 
graduate 
student 
at 
the 
University 
of 
Toledo, 
drove to the event with 
her 
classmates 
and 
her 
professor 
to 
hear 
Mills 
speak. Castellani said she is 
taking a class on critical race 
theory and has been reading 
Mills’s work in class.
Castellani said she talked 
to 
classmates 
about 
the 
audience 
member 
who 
brought up reverse racism. 
She said she believes his 
anger is a product of the fear 
of having his rights taken 
away. 

PHILOSOPHY

Catherine Marudo, Public 
Health junior and president 
of Phi Delta Epsilon, said 
she believes that despite the 
drawn-out process, it is still 
worth it to apply. She also 
advised 
students 
to 
have 
reasonable expectations.
“If 
you’re 
looking 
for 
clinical experience, it’s either 
a hit or a miss,” Marudo said. 
“You shouldn’t go in with 
the 
expectation 
that 
you 
will have patient experience 
since those clinical positions 
go really fast. But especially 
for pre-med students, any 
form of service in the long-
term will go well with their 
application and they should 
keep reaching out, whether at 
U of M Hospital or elsewhere, 
to find those opportunities.”
LSA 
Honors 
Adviser 
Stephanie Chervin addressed 
the importance of clinical 
experience 
for 
pre-med 
students and advised students 
to apply to other clinical 
settings as well, such as the 
Veterans 
Affairs 
Medical 
Center, St. Joseph’s Mercy 
and other clinics in the Ann 
Arbor area. 
She said she often comes 
across students who complain 
about 
the 
appointment 
slots filling up or missing 
deadlines.
“With 
the 
10,000 
pre-
meds we have, it definitely 
is a stressful thing for our 
students trying to get into U 
of M Hospital,” Chervin said.
LSA 
junior 
Kateryna 
Karpoff is currently involved 
in the Hospital Elder Life 
Program, a program at the 
University 
Hospital. 
For 
those looking to volunteer, 
she advised reaching out to 
upperclassmen to understand 
which programs allow for 
more patient interaction.
“Not all volunteer positions 
are equal, you do kind of have 
to fight for the better ones 

(with patient interaction),” 
Karpoff said. “I think (initially 
applying to the hospital) is a 
good segue, just to get your 
name in the system, and then 
each semester, you can reach 
out to the departments and 
ask if you can be placed in a 
position you’re interested in.”
Loulie Meynard, director 
of volunteer services at the 
University Hospital, said the 
department has made changes 
to the process over the years 
in an attempt to make it fairer. 
She 
discussed 
how 
in 
previous 
years, 
students 
would 
grab 
whatever 
appointment time they saw 
open 
without 
considering 
their own class schedule. 
Realizing this was an issue, 
the department shifted to a 
lottery system and assigned 
appointment times based on 
the availability indicated in 
the student application form. 
“The only thing we got 
tripped up on this time was 
one of the info sessions was 
scheduled before anyone got 
their class schedules. So now 
we are really paying attention 
to when that works,” Meynard 
said.
Michigan 
Medicine 
has 
more 
than 
2,000 
active 
volunteers. 
Meynard said it can be hard 
to manage all of them, but 
she said she attempts to work 
with students on a case-by-
case basis if they’ve attended 
multiple information sessions 
without getting an interview 
by guaranteeing them one in 
the next cycle. 
“We 
have 
a 
wonderful, 
terrible problem,” Meynard 
said. “There are more people 
in this community who want 
to 
volunteer 
at 
Michigan 
Medicine than we have places 
to put them.”

anonymous 
attack 
threatens the collegiality of 
the School and violates all 
standards of professional 
behavior,” Hanlon wrote.
Hanlon said he received 
two similar emails that 
summer. 
These 
emails 
reportedly warned Hanlon 
to 
investigate 
Philbert’s 
behavior. Hanlon was also 
allegedly told in person 
that there were previous 
complaints about Philbert.
When the University was 
informed of allegations of 
misconduct on Jan. 16 and 
17 this year, the University 
hired 
Washington 
D.C.-
based law firm WilmerHale 
to 
investigate 
Philbert’s 
history.
Philbert 
first 
came 
to the University as an 
assistant 
professor 
of 
toxicology in the School 
of Public Health in 1995, 
later becoming an associate 
professor in 2000. He was 
the 
associate 
chair 
for 
research and development 
in 
the 
Department 
of 
Environmental 
Health 
Sciences from 2000 to 2003. 
Philbert was promoted to 
professor in 2004 and served 
as the senior associate dean 
for research at the School 
of Public Health before 
being appointed as dean in 
2010. He was approved and 
began serving as provost in 
2017. As provost, Philbert 
presided over the Office 
of 
Institutional 
Equity, 
which is responsible for 
investigating 
claims 
of 
sexual misconduct.
In an email to The Daily, 
University 
spokesperson 
Kim 
Broekhuizen 
emphasized the importance 
of letting the investigation 
run its course.
“It is critical that we 
all 
allow 
the 
outside 
investigators to determine 
the 
facts,” 
Broekhuizen 
wrote. “While that process 
is ongoing, there is very 
little that we are able to 
say.”

petition signatures. 
She has yet to publish 
a 
platform, 
but 
she 
described her motivation 
to run for office in a 
statement posted to her 
Facebook page.
“My 
training 
and 
instincts 
are 
to 
make 
sure people are ok and 
safe. 
My 
upbringing 
reminds me how a poor, 
refugee family can claim 
new identities and build 
new communities,” Song 
wrote. “My friends were 
right. More social workers 
need to run for office.”
She 
also 
noted 
her 
previous electoral victory 
when she won her seat on 

the Ann Arbor District 
Library’s 
Board 
of 
Trustees in 2016. 
“My term ends this year 
and 
I’m 
committed 
to 
fulfilling my obligations 
as 
Board 
President,” 
Song 
wrote. 
“However, 
I’m 
once 
again 
called 
by community members 
to serve, this time for 
a 
different 
institution. 
I’ve pulled petitions so 
that I can be on this 
November’s ballot as a 
Democratic candidate for 
Ann Arbor’s City Council. 
The meetings are longer 
but the goals are the same 
when it comes to serving 
the public good.”
In 2018, Song protested 
a proposed amendment 

to the city charter to 
build a downtown park, 
instead 
advocating 
for 
the lot to be sold to 
Chicago developer Core 
Spaces to build a high-
rise apartment building. 
Song told MLive she 
thought the proposal was 
fraught.
“Designating 
the 
majority of the block in 
perpetuity as parkland, 
without 
the 
formal 
planning 
process, 
funding 
or 
public 
engagement 
that any other park or 
development 
would 
undergo, 
significantly 
limits future options for 
the 
downtown 
library 
and 
downtown 
area,” 
Song said.

Song is one of many

New dog, old and vitally important trick

I

n July 1787, the United States, 
under the governance of the 
Articles of Confederation, 
enacted a piece of legislation 
titled the “Northwest Ordinance.” 
The Ordinance called for the 
delegation of land to new states 
in the Northwest Territory — 
land bound to the west by the 
Appalachians, the south by the 
Ohio River and the northwest 
by the Great Lakes. Allocated to 
the U.S. in the Paris Treaty of 
1783, which formally ended the 
Revolutionary War, the territory 
had not yet been developed into 
designated states. The legislation 
contained rules regarding the 
formation of new states and their 
governments. However, its lasting 
effect lies not in its specificity, 
but rather in its advocacy for the 
adoption of righteous virtues 
in society and government. But 
what does this have to do with the 
University of Michigan, and how 
can this be relevant today? Well, 
every student has likely walked 
past the Ordinance’s moral pith, 
literally: It’s inscribed on the 
western facade of Angell Hall, 
the University’s largest academic 
building. 
Article 1 of the ordinance 
guaranteed 
that 
“no 
person, 
demeaning himself in a peaceable 
and orderly manner, shall ever 
be molested on account of his 
mode of worship or religious 
sentiments.” Similarly, Article 2 
ensures the writ of habeas corpus, 
trial by jury and no cruel and 
unusual punishments. Readers 
will recognize these as core tenets 
of the Bill of Rights that would 
come four years later. Perhaps the 
Ordinance enacted in 1787 — one 
year before the Constitution’s 
drafting — was a trial run of what 
would become foundational 
legislation. 
Additionally, 
Article 
6 
declares 
“there 
shall be neither slavery nor 
involuntary 
servitude” 
in 
the territory, and Article 3 
mandates that “the utmost 
good 
faith 
shall 
always 
be 
observed 
towards 
the 
Indians; 
their 
lands 
and 
property shall never be taken 
from 
them 
without 
their 
consent.” Keep in mind, this 
was 76 years before Lincoln’s 
Emancipation Proclamation. 
To my eye, they got it all right. 

But my fascination with the 
Ordinance — and what I believe 
is its paramount lasting effect — 
lies in the first sentence of Article 
3. It reads: “Religion, morality, 
and knowledge, being necessary 
to good government and the 
happiness of mankind, schools 
and the means of education shall 
forever be encouraged.” This is 
the text forever inscribed in stone 
above Angell Hall, and is clearly 
fitting. 
First is religion, which I believe, 
despite its debatable flaws, is the 
most successful and most effective 
means for teaching character that 
has ever existed. There are myriad 
lessons and teachings on virtue 
that are undeniably valuable; 
the condemnation of murder, 
theft and Coventry, the praise of 
integrity and encouragement of 
charity are all examples. Thomas 
Jefferson, the primary author of 
the Ordinance, understood this 
and rightly sought to preserve 
religion’s benefits. 
Morality follows next and is 
unique not only for its ambiguity 
or contentiousness but because 
of the means, and mediums, of its 
teaching. Religion is a longstanding 
source of morality, expounding 
lessons and stories that comment 
on the nature of that which is 
good and bad. On the other hand, 
education — especially through 
subjects like philosophy, history 
and English, with its analysis of 
texts — offers alternative means 
for discussing morality. Both 
operate synchronously and are 
each necessary to inculcate virtues 
vital to effective government 
and mankind. Again, Jefferson 
understood 
— 
and 
his 
pen 
further cemented in writing — 
these complementary forces as 
necessary means to an educated, 
virtuous and content populace.
Last is knowledge. The pursuit 
of knowledge has forever been 
the driver of mankind, from his 
first discovery of fire to Newton’s 
articulation of the world around 
us. And this pursuit is not 
rooted in vanity or fame, but in 
discovering new, more effective 
means to achieve prosperity. Fire 
enabled man to cook food, light 
his caves and triumph over the 
cold. Education is knowledge’s 
natural complement; it is how new 
knowledge is distributed. And 

once distributed, that knowledge is 
left to the creative and productive 
devices of the individual. By virtue 
yet again of mankind’s constant 
pursuit of knowledge — now 
embarking with more complex 
building 
blocks 
— 
fantastic 
achievements can be had. From 
Bacon to Babbage to Tesla to 
Turing, and more along the way, 
we arrived at the device on which 
I’m writing this. Not bad. 
Today, more information is 
accessible than ever in human 
history. 
Globally, 
3.7 
billion 
people access the internet. Google 
processes 40,000 searches every 
second. It has never been easier 
to access new information, and 
this is the modern legacy of 
Angell Hall’s inscription. Yes, 
“the means of education shall 
forever be encouraged.” Schools 
and universities must continue to 
educate class after class of scholars 
to ensure that each generation is 
well versed in broad fields of study. 
But I disagree with the notion 
that educational institutions must 
alone bear that burden. As a species, 
we learn a great deal from one 
another. Communities and religious 
institutions 
provide 
excellent 
resources to grow, and learn morals, 
virtues and engage in mitzvot. To 
some degree, it is the onus of the 
individual to pursue knowledge, 
in any and every aspect of life. 
For example, as a civic duty to our 
country exists the responsibility of 
individuals to formalize themselves 
with our government, and the 
processes by which it operates, to 
complement that which we are 
taught in schools. 
This dynamic must hold true 
across multiple disciplines. History, 
economics, writing and English 
are necessary proficiencies, and 
while it’s sad to observe the subpar 
performances in these provinces 
from vital institutions, there exists 
a complementary responsibility of 
every individual to seek knowledge. 
The Ordinance articulated this 
233 years ago, but the widespread 
accessibility of information today 
brings entirely new meaning to its 
text. We must adapt, and follow 
through on our instructions to 
achieve “good government and the 
happiness of mankind.”

Make reproductive rights non-partisan ... again
S

peaking 
to 
my 
own 
experience of President 
Donald Trump’s election, 
the aptest way I can describe 
the event is surreal. In the 
moment, it was as if we’d had 
the collective wind knocked 
out of us and were all trying 
to catch our breath. But once 
that breath was found, not a 
moment was wasted in using 
it to speak as survival plans 
for the next four years were 
laid out. For many folks with 
uteruses, reproductive health 
was a primary concern. Facing 
uncertainty about the future 
of insurance coverage and the 
right to choose, people took to 
the internet to seek and share 
suggestions for adapted birth 
control solutions. A popular 
recommendation was to get an 
intrauterine device (IUD), a 
method which can last for up 
to 12 years — outlasting even 
an eight-year administration. 
This advice was not taken for 
granted, with a 2019 JAMA 
Internal 
Medicine 
study 
finding the demand for IUDs 
and other long-lasting birth 
control increased after the 2016 
election.
While this demonstration of 
outreach and agency is inspiring, 
its 
necessity 
is 
somewhat 
absurd. Of course, there is a lot 
that’s absurd about Trump’s 
presidency. What began as a 
laughable candidacy rode a wave 
of manipulation, divisiveness 
and those notorious red “Make 
America 
Great 
Again” 
hats 
all the way to the Oval Office, 
taking Trump from a reality 
TV host to the president-elect 
in just over a year. But this need 
for a heightened fight for bodily 
autonomy 
seems 
especially 
unexpected when considering 
Trump’s 
past 
positions 
on 
the right to choose. In a 1999 
interview he claimed to be “pro-
choice in every respect,” a sharp 
contrast to his current status 
as the most pro-life president 
ever, according to White House 
counselor Kellyanne Conway. 
The changes he made to Title X, 
which caused the withdrawal of 
Planned Parenthood from the 
program, support this claim. 
But regardless of how genuine 
— or agreeable — this change 
in opinion is, it’s, in theory, the 
objectively strategic move. How 
could anyone hope to earn the 
Republican nomination without 
an 
anti-choice 
approach, 
considering 
the 
Republican 
Party’s definitively conservative 
stance on reproductive rights?
Actually, this stance is not as 
definitive as many may think. 
At present, reproductive rights, 
including access to birth control 
and abortion, are seen as a 
highly partisan issue. According 
to a Gallup poll, the proportion 
of 
Democrats 
who 
support 
legal abortion in all cases has 
risen distinctly in the past 
three decades while Republican 
support has gone down. For the 
stance of illegal abortion in all 
cases, the trends are reversed, 
with 
Democratic 
support 
decreasing 
and 
Republican 

support going up. But most 
significantly, these polls show 
how similar the proportions 
of Democratic and Republican 
support are to one another 
across all three circumstances 
— legality, limited legality and 
illegality — in 1975. In fact, in the 
first and last case, Republican 
and Democrat support differ 
by just one percent. So, what 
happened? When did party 
opinions divide? Why do they 
stay that way, and what can be 
done to change it?
Uncovering the answers to 
these questions is imperative 
in the advancement of health 
equity and bodily autonomy. 
Reproductive justice is a human 
rights issue — it should not be 
a political strategy. Legislation 
and accessibility should not be 
decided by strict partisan lines, 
but 
through 
consideration, 
compassion 
and 
critical 
thinking. And there should not 
be talk of strategic birth control 
survival every time a Republican 
takes the presidential oath.

The history of birth control 
is a complicated one, woven 
with 
threads 
of 
politics, 
overpopulation concerns and a 
dash of the American Dream. 
There is not a precise split 
resulting in a partisan approach 
to reproductive justice, but 
Harvard University professor 
Jill Lepore points out a moment 
when it began to fray in her 
2011 historical chronicle of 
reproductive rights in The New 
Yorker. Abridging this history 
a bit, let’s begin with Dwight 
Eisenhower. As a Republican 
president in 1959, Eisenhower 
claimed the funding of Planned 
Parenthood and family planning 
at large was not a public concern. 
But in 1965, with overpopulation 
concerns rising, he reversed 
his position, even co-chairing 
a 
Planned 
Parenthood 
committee. A few years later, 
U.S. Rep. George H.W. Bush 
and President Richard Nixon, 
both Republicans, pushed for 
public family planning, in terms 
of visibility and funding. As 
president, Nixon would go on 
to sign Title X in 1970, a federal 
grant dedicated to the provision 
of 
widely 
accessible 
family 
planning services.
This point, however, is where 
the non-partisan support for 
family planning hits a snag. 
Preparing for the election of 
1972, Nixon hoped to court 
Catholic voters and to divide the 
Democratic Party. His advisors 
urged him to reconsider his 
stance on abortion, a strategic 
move that would accomplish 

both objectives. Ultimately he 
listened, reversing his position 
on Title X, utilizing the Catholic 
rhetoric of the sanctity of life. 
And he won in 1972, leaving a 
divide in the Democratic Party.
The origin of the partisan 
fight 
over 
reproductive 
rights is not some ideological 
imperative — it’s a matter 
of 
campaign 
strategy. 
As 
Lepore 
puts 
it, 
“abortion 
wasn’t a partisan issue until 
Republicans made it one.” The 
legacy of this divisive move 
was not solidified until the 
late 1980s, with First Lady 
Betty Ford, Vice President 
Nelson 
Rockefeller 
and 
President Ronald Reagan all 
demonstrating inconsistencies 
in the Republican stance on 
abortion. But today, the effect 
is 
clear: 
The 
Republican 
Party at large stands firmly 
against 
abortion, 
while 
refusing for the most part to 
support better birth control 
accessibility, 
improved 
sex 
education or address the social 
structures which reproduce 
socioeconomic inequality and 
drive the desire for abortions 
in the first place.
American history makes it 
clear that reproductive rights 
do not have to be a partisan 
issue — and if we hope to 
advance them, they shouldn’t 
be. Moreover, the right to 
not have children should be 
incorporated into the larger, 
intersectional framework of 
reproductive 
justice, 
which 
also includes the rights to have 
children and to raise them 
with dignity. According to 
Nixon, “no American woman 
should be denied access to 
family 
planning 
assistance 
because 
of 
her 
economic 
condition.” The right to plan 
a family — whether or not that 
plan includes children — is a 
fundamental one, regardless 
of not only economic class, but 
of race, gender identity, sexual 
orientation and even marital 
status.
The Trump administration 
continues 
to 
threaten 
this 
right through stricter Title X 
regulations, attempts to slash 
the Affordable Care Act and a 
plan to gut Roe v. Wade. In this 
era of oppression and control, 
it’s 
clear 
the 
increasingly 
partisan 
divide 
on 
family 
planning is on a dangerous 
trajectory, 
jeopardizing 
the 
accessibility 
of 
reproductive 
rights and dismantling hope for 
a future of total reproductive 
justice and equality. We need 
to advocate for a collaborative 
approach to reproductive justice 
that is not based on Republicans 
or Democrats, but on mutual 
dedication 
to 
freedom 
and 
liberty. 
Together, 
we 
will 
make reproductive rights non-
partisan again. Oh, by the way 
— if we make any merchandise, 
can we instead go for a colorless 
gaudy than imperial red? It just 
clashes with everything.

Technology should be our salvation, not our downfall
T

oday, 
technological 
failures 
often 
drive 
conversations 
about 
how 
inconvenient 
and 
counterproductive technology 
can be. As evidenced by the 
app used to carry out the data 
collection 
during 
the 
Iowa 
caucus 
earlier 
this 
month, 
technology can be complex and 
problematic. Additionally, the 
overwhelming 
difficulty 
of 
utilizing start-up technology 
on 
a 
national 
scale 
has 
become 
apparent, 
and 
we 
have to realize that digitized 
products must be improved by 
developers for years in order 
to ensure widespread success 
among consumers. 
Major 
issues 
can 
be 
averted 
when 
we 
embed 
preventative 
technology 
into 
our 
infrastructure. 
The 
proven 
effectiveness 
of 
applying 
computerized 
numerical models to predict 
weather patterns, including 
damaging storms, outweighs 
the inconvenience of the lack 
of public access to this type 
of 
technology. 
That 
said, 
we have not discovered the 
potential benefits of enacting 
automated 
infrastructural 
processes — such as building 
rehabilitation 
or 
land 
restoration — in immediate 
response to climate disasters. 
Processes that use algorithms 
to direct unmanned, automatic 
equipment could be adapted 
by technology to limit human 
interaction and facilitate faster 
reactions to large scale issues. 
Though 
difficulties 
exist, 
automated 
infrastructural 
recovery 
efforts 
and 
their 
ability to help society recover 
from 
destructive 
natural 
disasters are promising, just 
as 
engineered 
remedies 
in 
medicine serve as promising 
solutions to health issues today. 
Technological advancements 
have 
assisted 
society 
in 
carrying 
out 
solutions 
to 
physical 
problems 
in 
the 
natural 
world. 
But 
these 

advancements have essentially 
been isolated solutions and 
I wonder if expanding the 
functionality and accessibility 
of 
technology 
could 
allow 
society to increase its reliance. 
Could 
current 
efforts 
to 
develop 
smart 
stormwater 
systems in Ann Arbor have 
been 
used 
to 
prevent 
or 
mitigate 
the 
contamination 
of the Detroit River with 
uranium and other harmful 
chemicals? In other words, 
could reducing the impact of 
these mistakes imposed on 
the environment be instigated 
with digitized infrastructural 
solutions? In this regard, the 
advancement of technology 
could serve society in more 
conducive, far-reaching ways.
More 
importantly, 
this 
technology could better equip 
us to address major climate 
issues. Since the University 
of 
Michigan 
is 
a 
public 
research institution, it’s our 
responsibility 
to 
commit 
to innovation to facilitate 
how 
college 
campuses 
address climate issues with 
technology. 
Leaders 
on 
campus 
should 
understand 
the importance of investing 
in the future of the entire 
campus and work to prioritize 
these 
efforts 
above 
other 
points of interest, like the 
apparent aversion to making 
substantial transitions toward 
a carbon-neutral campus. 
As 
community 
members 
with the potential to influence 
administrative decisions, we 
should push for legislature 
that will not hinder a society 
distressed by climate change. 
Instead, these developments in 
citywide, regional and national 
policy should become tailored 
for an inclusive environment 
where not everyone is required 
to be educated thoroughly and 
where everyone can benefit 
from 
the 
intellectual 
and 
physical access to technology. 
In doing so, a community 
like Ann Arbor could see 

widespread 
benefits 
from 
research-developed technology, 
and as these solutions ultimately 
become 
implementable 
for 
society, they could be used to 
address climate issues. 
Society 
should 
strive 
to create more automated 
climate solutions that can be 
executed through technology 
due 
to 
the 
opportunities 
technological 
progress 
can 
provide. 
From 
separating 
cafeteria waste to restoring 
a coastal wetland affected 
by a hurricane, technology 
could 
enable 
society 
to 
achieve more in both trivial 
and 
monumental 
tasks. 
Transforming our mindset to 
one of speculation about how 
we utilize existing technology 
and 
act 
on 
hypothetical 
advancements is essential for 
progress.
It’s reasonable to wonder 
if human intervention is the 
answer 
society 
is 
looking 
for, one that could ultimately 
restore 
all 
humans 
have 
laid waste to. Should we, 
as the carriers of modern 
civilization, instead remove 
ourselves from the natural 
world as a way to prevent 
further 
burden 
going 
forward? With this question 
in mind, the driving force 
behind a sustainable future 
should be the belief that 
we are capable of involving 
ourselves positively in the 
healing process of the planet. 
Every day, the commitment 
to creating positive human 
intervention in the natural 
world 
contributes 
to 
its 
revival. Challenging ourselves 
to commit to technological 
solutions that propagate a 
positive way in which we 
respond to and remedy the 
climate 
disasters 
we 
will 
inevitably face is the first step 
in making our multifarious 
natural world a better place.

Michigan learning to adapt with three wrestlers out on Olympic redshirts

Shortly 
after 
the 
World 
Wrestling Championships ended, 
Michigan coach Sean Bormet met 
with his competitors in a hotel 
room. They had 24 hours to make 
a decision.
At the week-long competition, 
two 
Michigan 
wrestlers 
had 
qualified for the Olympics. Two 
others had a shot at Olympic 
Trials. But now, they had to decide 
if they wanted to remain with 
the Wolverines or disenroll from 
classes and take Olympic redshirts.
Worlds ended on Sept. 22. The 
add/drop deadline was Sept. 23. 
Each wrestler had put this choice 
aside for a bit, but now, they had to 
make a decision.
The 
NCAA 
offers 
Olympic 
redshirts to wrestlers who meet 
certain conditions: past national 
team members, top-3 finishers 
at NCAAs, top-8 finishers at the 
Senior U.S. Open or previous 
medalists at Cadet, Junior or U23 
Worlds. This year, Michigan — 
coming off a fifth-place finish at the 
NCAA Championships in 2019 — 
had four wrestlers who met those 
conditions.
Myles Amine and Stevan Micic 
both finished fifth at Worlds — 
competing for San Marino and 
Serbia, respectively — and punched 
their tickets to Tokyo. Logan Massa 
and Kanen Storr both compete for 
the United States and would have 
opportunities throughout the year 
to qualify.
Because 
they 
compete 
for 
European countries, Micic and 
Amine had travel obligations that 
would make attending classes 
difficult. Olympic wrestling has just 
six weight classes compared to the 
NCAA’s 10, so Micic needs to drop a 
weight and Amine is moving up one 
in preparation. 
The four decided that whatever 
they did, they would do it together. 
Amine, Micic and Massa were set 
to be fifth-year seniors, and they 
wanted to complete their last year 
of eligibility together to ensure the 
team was as strong as possible that 

year. Storr, a redshirt junior, had 
two years left, so he could go either 
way.
By the end of the day, they’d 
made their decision: All four 
withdrew from classes to chase 
their dreams. And with that, the 
rest of the Wolverines entered 
uncharted territory.
Though he’s just in his second 
year 
as 
head 
coach, 
Bormet 
competed for Michigan in the 
early 1990s and returned as an 
assistant coach in 2011. Through 
his years with the program, Bormet 
doesn’t remember an instance of 
the Wolverines using even a single 
Olympic redshirt. At the start of 
the season, Bormet had to take a 
team with high expectations and 
navigate through the loss of four of 
its top wrestlers.
Michigan scuffled out of the gate, 
dropping a dual to North Carolina 
and finishing in the middle of the 
pack at invitationals. Meanwhile, 
Storr realized his chances for the 
Olympics were dwindling — his 
main hope to qualify for Olympic 
Trials was to win an NCAA title. 
So he registered for classes for 
the winter semester and pulled 
his redshirt at the Midlands 
Championships in December.
“Midway through the (fall) 
semester, I thought, ‘I really don’t 
wanna put off school any longer. 
I wanna wrestle a long time, so 
there’s no point for me to delay my 
career,’ ” Storr said. “And ... I think 
me coming back was just a good 
little kickstart to kind of start the 
second half strong.”
Storr’s 
return 
helped, 
but 
the results for the team have 
nevertheless been mixed. Michigan 
still has three top-10 wrestlers — 
Storr and redshirt freshman Will 
Lewan are both ranked No. 9 in 
their respective weight classes, 
while sophomore Mason Parris is 
No. 2 in the country at heavyweight. 
But there’s only so much three 
wrestlers can do.
Many of the Wolverines’ matches 
tell similar stories: Michigan starts 
out stong and builds up a lead, but 
that cushion evaporates as the 
middle of the lineup comes up — 

the spots Massa, Amine and Micic 
usually fill. Young wrestlers try 
their best to hold their own against 
tough Big Ten competition. Then 
Parris comes and tries to save 
the day. Sometimes it’s enough. 
Sometimes it isn’t.
Bormet admits that he’s a 
competitive person and he’s not 
fully satisfied with Michigan’s 
results. But he also views this 
season as a challenge to his entire 
staff — how can they get the most 
out of a depleted roster?
Sometimes, wrestlers have had 
to compete in higher weight classes 
than normal — redshirt junior 
Tyler Meisinger has wrestled at 
three different weights this year 
and junior Reece Hughes has 
wrestled at four.
Michigan knows it’ll take its 
lumps at times. From there, it 
becomes about limiting damage. 
Even in losses, individual wrestlers 
can mitigate the blow by keeping 
opponents from earning bonus 

points 
or 
major 
decisions 
— 
potentially allowing a teammate 
like Storr or Parris to aid in a 
comeback later.
Meanwhile, Amine, Micic and 
Massa are still in Ann Arbor. They 
go through individualized workout 
regimens, but still occasionally 
practice with the team, along 
with providing moral support and 
offering advice. That gives the 
wrestlers a chance to learn from 
some of the best in the sport — 
and an extra year to compete with 
them, too.
“It’s not the end of the world 
cause it’s … just a redshirt,” Lewan 
said. “They’re gonna get back and 
be able to wrestle for us still. It just 
gives me a longer time to get people 
that good in the room.”
It’s not hard to see the flip side 
of the struggles this year. Amine, 
Micic and Massa plan to return for 
their final year of eligibility next 
season. Storr will be back too, along 
with Lewan and Parris. That’s 60 

percent of Michigan’s lineup spots 
going to top-level wrestlers. With 
that much talent and experience, 
the Wolverines have a good chance 
to contend nationally.
There 
are 
a 
few 
roster 
complications, of course. Losing 
three wrestlers to the Olympics 
wasn’t part of any long-term 
plan for Bormet; rather, it was 
something that the athletes and 
staff only started discussing in the 
last 6-8 months. That would throw 
a wrench into even the best thought 
out recruiting plans, but the 
nature of wrestling scholarships 
mitigates that issue somewhat. 
Division I wrestling teams get 
9.9 scholarships to work with; 
Michigan has 33 athletes on its 
roster this year. So most wrestlers 
are on just partial scholarship, if 
they’re on scholarship at all.
On the other hand, the redshirts 
mean there are people who believed 
they would have lineup spots next 
year who suddenly won’t. But 

any wrestler knows that intense 
roster competition comes with the 
territory, and Bormet believes the 
idea of a powerhouse team next 
year will be just as enticing.
“Even in the recruiting process, 
that’s talked about a lot,” Bormet 
said. “And when you go to a school 
that has a really good wrestling 
program like ours and a really 
competitive program, next year 
we’re trying to put our best lineup 
on the mat to win a national 
championship, guys know that 
it’s gonna be competitive to get a 
starting spot.”
Bormet sees it as a two-way 
street. Of course it’s a sacrifice for 
any college coach to lose three of 
his best wrestlers for a season. But 
wrestling is also one of the most 
difficult sports to make an Olympic 
team in — just 16 athletes make it at 
each weight.

Hayhurst helped by position switch

Back 
in 
December, 
Mel 
Pearson leaned back in his 
chair at Yost Ice Arena and 
reflected on graduate transfer 
forward Jacob Hayhurst’s first-
half performance.
At 
the 
time, 
Hayhurst 
had only one goal through 
his first 20 games — after 
Pearson picked him up as a 
graduate transfer because of 
his offensive ability. In each of 
his last two years at Rensselaer 
Polytechnic 
Institute 
(RPI), 
Hayhurst led the Engineers in 
points with 23.
But when he started at 
Michigan, the offensive output 
dried up. In game after game, 
Hayhurst found himself with 
Grade-A scoring chances, but 
just couldn’t find the back of 
the net. It took until Nov. 8 for 
him to light the lamp, and it 
was the only goal he scored in 
the first half of the year.
“I thought he’d be a better 
goal 
scorer,” 
Pearson 
said 
Dec. 11. “He’s had some great 
chances, even this weekend he 
had some. Saturday, (he had) 
some great looks. He just can’t 
finish.”
When the Wolverines came 
back from the mid-season break, 
it appeared that Hayhurst’s old 
issues had come back with him. 
In the second game back — the 
GLI 
championship 
against 
Michigan Tech — he caught 
the post late, when Michigan 
needed a goal to tie things up 
and force overtime.
Then the Wolverines got 
back into conference play, and 
a switch flipped. After moving 
from center to the wing in late 
November, Hayhurst looked 
settled in his new role by the 
time Michigan went to Notre 
Dame in early January.
It was a move made by 
necessity 
— 
Hayhurst 
was 
injured in November and it 
wasn’t clear if he’d be able to 
play, so Pearson had him work 
as the extra skater instead 
of centering a regular line in 
practice — but it ended up being 
exactly what Hayhurst needed 

to find his footing.
“That’s been an awesome 
transition for me,” Hayhurst 
said Wednesday. “Wing wasn’t 
something that I was really 
used to to start the season. … 
I think jumping to a wing just 
gives you a little more space. 
You get to kind of observe 
the ice a little more instead of 
having a definite defensive-end 
responsibility where you need 
to pick a guy up and stay on 
him, so it definitely gives you a 
lot more option for creativity.”
Complicating the adjustment 
was that Hayhurst’s transition 
in roles at Michigan wasn’t just 
moving from center to winger 
— he went from go-to scorer to 
playing more of a depth role.
At RPI, Hayhurst carried the 
mantle of the leading scorer 
on a team that struggled to get 
wins. For the Wolverines, even 
when they were struggling for 
most of the year, the offense 
has come by committee, and 
Hayhurst has spent most of the 
year on the third line. Adjusting 
to a new role, in a new system, 
at a new school, took longer 
than anyone expected, but now 
it looks as though Hayhurst has 
fully acclimated.
“I don’t think, for me or 
for the coaching staff, things 
transitioned as fast as we 
would’ve liked,” Hayhurst said, 
“but I think now you can see 
that they’ve finally transitioned 

and I think it’s at a good point 
in the year where the whole 
team’s hot. We’re heading into 
playoffs, we’re kind of on a roll, 
so I think everything’s going 
really well.”
In his seventh game as a 
winger — after playing center 
for almost his entire career 
— Hayhurst found twine for 
his second goal in a Michigan 
sweater. Three games later, 
he added another. Two weeks 
after that, he scored a goal in 
each of the Wolverines’ wins 
over Wisconsin.
Both 
goals 
against 
the 
Badgers 
were 
highlight-reel 
tallies — and Saturday night’s 
goal was the eventual game-
winner. 
The 
goal-scoring 
acumen Pearson saw when 
looking for a transfer back in 
the spring was finally coming 
to light.
“You see it,” Pearson said. 
“The goal he scored Friday, 
he just had patience. Most 
guys will just bang that puck 
right back into the pile, but 
he fakes, takes some time, 
takes a step. He’s got the net 
to shoot at. And then even on 
the goal on Saturday, it was all 
individualistic, but you can see 
the skill and the change of pace 
and the deception that he has.
“He knows how to put the 
puck in the net. I think he’s 
positioned to have a really good 
finish here.”

Livers, Brooks proving dangerous

EVANSTON – Michigan’s 
game 
plan 
against 
Northwestern on Wednesday 
night 
was 
clear 
from 
the 
outset: make the most of a size 
advantage and attack the paint 
all night long.
The first five minutes of 
the 
contest 
made 
it 
clear 
that the plan needed some 
adjustment. The Wolverines 
went 0-for-8 attacking the 
rim over that stretch. Despite 
being significantly smaller, the 
Wildcats looked surprisingly 
solid defending the paint.
So Michigan changed its 
approach, looking more to the 
outside, searching for open 
shots and able shooters.
And there, in the steady 
hands of a pair of juniors, was 
the solution to Wednesday 
night’s 
problems. 
Forward 
Isaiah Livers and shooting 
guard Eli Brooks combined 
for 35 points, 10 rebounds and 
a fair number of electrifying 
shots, helping Michigan to a 
79-54 win.
With Livers’ recent long-
awaited return from a lingering 
groin 
injury, 
Michigan’s 
offense has been finding some 
of the energy and movement 

it had been lacking without 
him. Livers had 17 points 
Wednesday night, but he was 
also key in keeping the ball in 
motion on offense, in creating 
opportunities 
not 
just 
for 
himself, but for everyone.
“When I’m out there, I mean, 
yeah I try to get my shot, cause 
coach (Juwan) Howard tells me 
to be aggressive, but also, I’ve 
been able to move the ball,” 
Livers said. “If I’ve been on 
top, I’m trying to orchestrate, 
get (Jon Teske) the ball, try to 
swing it to Eli for a 3, get (Zavier 
Simpson) 
downhill, 
Franz 
(Wagner) doing what he does. I 
just — I know my players, so I 
know who to swing it to.”
But 
Livers 
is 
one 
of 
Michigan’s top talents, and 
with that mantle comes added 
pressure 
from 
opposing 
defenses. In situations where 
Livers can’t get open, Michigan 
turns to Brooks, who Livers 
refers to as “the silent assassin.” 
When the Wolverines get him 
an open shot, more often than 
not, the result is nothing but 
net. Often, it’s enough to shift 
the rhythm, the pace of the 
game back to Michigan. 
When 
Northwestern 
started making a run late, the 
Wolverines needed something 
to swing the momentum back 

to them, something to stem the 
purple tide. So they looked to 
Brooks outside.
He buried it from the arc.
“That was huge,” Howard 
said. “Eli made that three 
when we’d been struggling to 
score, but more importantly, 
struggling to make a play. The 
three was huge. It gave us that 
momentum that we needed.”
Both players have proven 
themselves capable of making 
those kinds of poster-worthy, 
morale-boosting 
plays 

throughout the season. Late in 
Wednesday’s game, a resurgent 
Livers — still nursing the 
remnants of that nagging groin 
injury — couldn’t resist making 
one more. 
He 
got 
the 
feed 
from 
sophomore point guard David 
DeJulius. The result: a massive, 
one-handed 
airborne 
dunk. 
The healthy Michigan crowd 
at Welsh-Ryan Arena exploded. 
Livers — and the Wolverines 
they knew — were finally back.
“Every time I run down the 
middle, Dave is always giving 
it back to me,” Livers said, 
grinning. “I already knew. I’m 
there in my take-off zone, want 
to jump off one. I’m all good. 
No injuries. So it was exciting 
to get a dunk — two dunks — 
and finish a game.”

EVANSTON 
— 
Michigan 
coach Juwan Howard stepped 
off the plane in Chicago and 
inhaled deeply. He was back 
home. There was something 
different about the air in his 
hometown, he said.
Whether it was the nostalgia 
of being back where he grew 
up or the crowd of maize 
and blue in the bleachers at 
Northwestern 
or 
the 
herd 
of old friends — including 
former NBA All-Star Dikembe 
Mutombo 
— 
Howard 
felt 
different about Wednesday’s 
game.
Whatever was in the air 
though, clearly affected the 
Wolverines (15-9 overall, 6-7 
Big Ten), who trounced the 
Wildcats (6-17, 1-12) to the tune 
of 79-54 in a full display of the 
team’s talents.
But things weren’t so rosy 
from 
the 
onset. 
Michigan 
started the game badly, opening 
up the contest 0-for-11 from 
the floor with seven of those 
shots registering as either 
layups or dunks. Most of the 
offensive stagnancy fell on the 
shoulders of senior center Jon 
Teske, who failed to convert 
around the rim, missing easy 
looks against a drastically 
undersized 
Northwestern 
team. He finished with six 
points on 3-for-14 shooting.
But that was the last time 
Michigan needed to worry 
about the outcome of the game.
And, as if possessed, the 
Wolverines’ 
shooters 
began 
to take things into their own 
hands.
Junior guard Eli Brooks 
lit it up from behind the arc, 
going 4-for-8 and finishing 
with a team-high 18 points. His 
quick release and deep range 
torched the Wildcats all night 
and earned the nickname “the 
silent assassin” from teammate 
Isaiah Livers. 
Adding 
to 
the 
offensive 
production — largely in the 
first half — was senior forward 
Austin Davis, who checked 
in for the flailing Teske and 

added a much-needed presence 
in the interior.
If 
a 
programmer 
were 
designing a consistent, reliable 
player to fill the 10 feet or so in 
front of the rim, that player’s 
performance 
would 
look 
strikingly similar to Davis’s in 
the first half.
The big man opened up 
his scoring in style with a 
two-handed 
flush, making a 
statement 
that 
the lax interior 
presence would 
not 
continue. 
The 
new-life 
offense 
went 
on a 26-5 run 
to take a strong 
38-23 lead into 
the locker room.
Oh, and the 
Wolverines did it all without 
star guard Zavier Simpson, 
who watched all the action 
from the bench with two quick 
fouls. Sophomore guard David 
DeJulius stepped up, as he’s 
done in the past, and filled 
Simpson’s shoes to the inch, 
finishing with seven points 
and seven assists.
“When 
(Simpson) 
came 
in, they told me it was my 
opportunity,” DeJulius said. 
“And I watched film and saw 
how they play defense, and I 
just executed the game plan.
“And I’m naturally a scorer, 
that’s just my game, but that’s 
not what I care about. I care 
about doing whatever is best 
for the team, and just to see 
that I got seven assists. … That 
feels good for me.”
If 
ever 
one 
play 
could 
characterize 
a 
game 
of 
basketball, it would have to be 
Livers’ ferocious slam late in 
the second half. With just over 
five minutes to play, Livers 
found himself streaking down 
the court after a massive block 
from Teske. The junior caught 
the feed from DeJulius and 
forced down a thunderous 
dunk to shake the building.
It also helped that the 
Wildcats sit comfortably in 
the basement of the Big Ten 
standings. 

Northwestern showed some 
life later in the half though, 
catching stride with its shot 
selection. 
The 
Wildcats 
threatened to chip away at a 
20-point Wolverine lead with 
an 8-0 run, but would never 
actualize the comeback with 
Brooks drilling a 3-pointer to 
snap Michigan out of the rut.
Brooks’s 3-pointer felt like 
more 
of 
an 
inevitability 
rather than a 
big-time shot by 
a veteran player. 
The game was 
never truly in 
doubt and the 
Wolverines 
proved 
to 
be 
simply 
too 
much 
for 
the 
undersized 
Wildcats. After all, they were 
never meant to spoil Howard’s 
homecoming.
Maybe that’s why the “Let’s 
Go Blue!” chants emanating 
from the stands in Evanston 
following 
Livers’s 
game-
defining dunk didn’t feel out of 
place. Through Howard, this 
was Michigan’s home game 
too.

EVANSTON — When the 
Michigan men’s basketball team 
needed a spark on Wednesday, 
it turned to an unlikely source.
It was a game in which the 
Wolverines 
shouldn’t 
have 
needed a spark in the first 
place, for a number of reasons. 
But even coming off a season-
altering win over Michigan 
State, Michigan struggled out of 
the gate against Northwestern.
The Wolverines’ early-game 
struggles have become all too 
predictable. Just four days after 
missing 10 of its first 11 shots 
against the Spartans, Michigan 
failed to find bottom on 13 of 
its first 15 against the Big Ten’s 
doormat.
Enter Austin Davis.
In the midst of a breakout 
senior season, the forward 
injected a jolt of life into a half-
empty Welsh-Ryan Arena when 
the Wolverines needed it most. 
After Isaiah Livers’s baseline 
drive was cut off, the junior 
forward found an open Davis 
beneath the rim.
With Michigan trailing, 13-8, 
he rose above three Wildcats 

and threw down a two-handed 
flush.
The dunk ignited an 8-0 
spurt for the Wolverines — one 
that eventually became a 27-5 
run, propelling Michigan to a 
79-54 victory. Davis was a key 
cog through it all, scoring seven 
points in just six minutes, on 
his way to nine total points. His 
first-half performance came on 
the heels of a dismal start from 
senior center Jon Teske, who 
missed his first four layups 
before throwing a dunk off the 
back of the rim.
“(Austin) is so strong,” Livers 
said. “… His finishing around 
the rim is probably the best on 
the team, honestly.”
Just over a year ago, he was 
upended 
by 
then-freshman 
forward Brandon Johns Jr. 
for Michigan’s backup center 
duties. At the time, Johns was 
battling a steep learning curve 
and playing out of position. 
Even still, former coach John 
Beilein preferred him over 
Davis.
This season, however, Davis 
has flipped the script. He 
began the campaign behind 
sophomore 
forward 
Colin 
Castleton 
before 
surpassing 

him 
in 
December. 
Against 
conference opponents, Davis is 
averaging 5.3 points on a team-
best 71 percent shooting clip.
What’s most intriguing about 
Davis, though, is the timeline 
of his emergence. He’s peaking 
in his fourth year with the 
program — a time in which 
players have usually already 
reached their ceiling.
In Davis’s case, the turning 
point came when Michigan 
tabbed Beilein’s replacement in 
May.
“That’s the Austin we knew, 
but the man just took coach 
(Juwan) Howard to come in 
here and work on his post 
moves,” Livers said. “His post 
moves are elite. I’ve had to 
guard that big dude down there 
before — it’s not easy at all.”
Added Davis: “(Howard) is 
high energy all the time. He’s 
pedal to the metal every minute 
of practice. I love it. He’s down 
in the trenches with the post 
guys working with us. He’s got 
the pad, he’s banging on us and 
he’s giving us feedback as we’re 
going. It’s really invaluable. … 
The amount of knowledge and 
corrections he makes everyday 
is incredible. He played 19 years 
in the NBA, and it really comes 
through.”
Following 
Wednesday’s 
4-for-4 shooting performance, 
finishing with nine points, 
Davis is now shooting an eye-
popping 94 percent from the 
field over Michigan’s last five 
games. At this rate, he won’t 
remain an unlikely spark source 
for much longer.
When Davis returned to 
the locker room after the 
game, there was an unfamiliar 
face 
waiting. 
Dikembe 
Mutombo, one of Howard’s 
self-proclaimed 
“favorite 
teammates” from his playing 
days — greeted him with the 
hand he used to popularize his 
signature finger wag.
For a moment, the line 
between idolization and reality 
was blurred.
And for Wednesday’s unlikely 
spark source, it was only fitting 
for his first congratulations to 
come from an unfamiliar face.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

“Once upon a time, not long ago, I was 
a hoe,” sang rapper/singer/Internet meme 
Mariahlynn through our phone speaker, 
my two best friends and I singing along 
as we hurtled across Europe in a rickety 
passenger train. This was not the first 
time any of us had mimicked her risque 
lyrics in public. By the end of our trip 
to Vienna last year, we had memorized 
the entirety of “Once Upon a Time” and 
several other incredibly explicit songs. 
Sitting on that train, whisper-screaming 
lines like “But I fuck him though / And I 
don’ even care if his mother know,” I had 
a momentary thought — would songs like 
this have even existed 15 years ago? 
Sure, maybe from a male writer or 
singer, but not from a woman, at least 
not so brazenly. The reinvention of lust 
in music has turned what used to be 
unmentionable into a badge of pride for 
some female-identifying artists, as glitter 
and sweat and everything in between 
mixes to create the new sound of sex. 
This sound seems so commonplace now, 
with samples that would fit right in on 
PornHub, littering songs like the popular 
“Deepthroat” by CupcakKe. They are 
created by somewhat fringe artists, but the 
shock value of their work and its positive 
embrace of sexuality have catapulted this 
new idea of popstar sexuality into the 
spotlight. Though CupcakKe announced 
she was retiring in September 2019, in 
December she came back to announce 
she had not only lost 30 pounds, but also 
signed an $8 million deal with Sony Music 
Entertainment. That’s right, SONY.
The same company that boasts Beyonce, 
Michael Jackson and Prince in their ranks 
not only signed CupcakKe, but gave 
her millions of dollars, of which she is 
allegedly donating $60,000. If that’s not 
evidence of a major paradigm shift, I don’t 
know what is. In the age of the internet, 
anyone can cultivate their own audience, 
regardless 
of 
the 
content 
they 
are 
producing. For artists like CupcakKe, this 
independent following is what supported 
her brash acceptance of sex and its motifs 
in her music. But even for those who 
aren’t putting orgasm-like sounds in the 
first seconds of their singles, things are 
changing for the sex-positive artist. 
This change began in the late ‘90s and 
early aughts for artists like Peaches, whose 
2002 record The Teaches of Peaches 
includes titles such as the ultra-popular 
“Fuck the Pain Away.” Her early songs are 
a cacophony of machine-generated drums 

and cymbals, the artist’s languid talk-
singing detailing her sexual escapades 
in emotional and physical detail. It’s this 
nonchalant acknowledgement of female 
sexuality that marks the difference from 
previous artists, as the hidden secrets of 
‘70s songs like The Starland Vocal Band’s 
“Afternoon Delight” are now made clear 
for a listener to plainly understand.
These moments of heightened femme 
pleasure-seeking exist on a scale, ranging 
from the drawling lyrics of artists like 
Lana Del Rey to the intensely explicit 
Brooke Candy, but the fact that they exist 
at all in the mainstream is a wonder of its 
own. Del Rey sings “My pussy tastes like 
Pepsi-Cola / My eyes are wide like cherry 
pies,” and an audience of millions listens.
Del Rey in particular represents a niche 
of the sexualised pop-star that bridges 
the gap between traditional songwriting 
and the new world of increasingly 
devoted internet fanbases. Her fans love 
her because she is transparent about the 
harsh realities of hypersexuality, about 
the turmoil and violence of relationships 
with bad men and good men all the same. 
One could argue that Del Rey, real name 
Lizzie Grant, is a character immune 
to the flak of sharing her sexuality so 
plainly in the public eye. But I’d say that 
her presence in the mainstream media is 
that of an interloper from the internet age, 
where her flower-child inspired persona 
grew into what it is today.
The reason she can sing lyrics like “In 
the land of gods and monsters / I was 
an angel, lookin’ to get fucked hard,” 
is because of her fanbase, much like 
CupcakKe’s, yet she has hidden them in 

a traditionally pop format. If you don’t 
look closely, she could be singing about 
anything in a sexy voice, seemingly 
slurring her words in a stylized old-
Hollywood persona. As one of the initial 
female artists to bring the complexity of 
bold sexuality from an internet subgenre 
to top-40 stardom, Del Rey’s popularity 
signaled the introduction of newer, even 
more intense and honest artists than 
herself. 
This shift is in part due to these artists, 
as the audiences for their music become 
desensitized to the shock value and 
up-front crudeness of their lyrics, but it 
has also been influenced by the massive 
changes in the music industry at large. We 
no longer rely on sanitized, FCC-regulated 
radio to get our music — not even in the car 
or on a train — as my friends and I found 
that day on the way to Austria. Listeners 
are now able to choose what they want 
from their musicians, supporting artists 
that would not have made it to the ears 
of record executives, let alone the radio, 
because of their niche status or subjects. 
We are now able to directly support 
artists like Del Rey, CupcakKe, Peaches 
and Brooke Candy, at the same time 
proving the existence of an audience 
for them and furthering the presence of 
sex-positive music for femme, queer and 
other 
traditionally 
underrepresented 
demographics. The personalization of 
music in the last two decades has made 
it possible to bring what has always been 
private into the public eye, thus allowing 
the hushed existence of female lust and 
sexuality to enter the spotlight it so 
desperately needs.

Doing nothing for 
as long as possible

EMILY YANG
Daily Arts Writer

Not long after I sat down 
to 
write 
about 
Ottessa 
Moshfegh’s third novel, “My 
Year Of Rest And Relaxation,” 
I got an email notification 
from the campus health center 
informing me that I had mono. 
I wasn’t surprised, exactly: 
when I went in for tests, I 
figured I had the flu but with 
an abnormally prolonged and 
intense sore throat. As it turns 
out, I somehow have something 
worse than the flu: a disease 
that stays latent in a person 
for months, slowly taking out a 
tide of fever and fatigue. 
I was mortified about this, 
obviously, but I was also a bit 
relieved. I had something to 
call the feelings that were 
amassing in my body and a 
satisfactory 
explanation 
for 
everything. I could send emails 
to my professors and safely 
take a few days off to “recover,” 
which is to say sit around and 
do nothing. In the meantime 
I would get sympathetic coos 
from friends and housemates 
who would wander into the 
room and see me in my pathetic 
state curled up in a blanket. 
The unnamed protagonist 
in 
Moshfegh’s 
novel, 
who 
tries to sleep off her malaise 
for 
a 
year, 
doesn’t 
have 
anything to call it — the word 
“depression” doesn’t make a 
single appearance in the book 
— but she does give her vague 
feelings a shape. She gives 
herself a year of nothing, an 
allotted time for her to change. 
Moshfegh writes: “I thought 
life would be more tolerable 
if my brain were slower to 
condemn the world around 
me.” She wants to detach, to 
not care. And so she goes to a 
disreputable psychiatrist and 
gets prescribed all manner 

of anti-anxiety medications, 
sleep aids and sedatives, and 
self-medicates herself into a 
stupor 
somewhere 
between 
wakefulness and sleep.
The novel manages to be 
engaging despite this premise. 
There’s still a whiff of agency 
and rebellion in this dramatic 
act of refusal, a sense in which 
the 
protagonist 
is 
taking 
control of her life (or at least 
attempting to) by refusing to 
live it. Given what the rest 

of her world looks like — an 
unsatisfying job at a gallery, 
a 
humiliating 
on-again-off-
again relationship with an 
older 
Wall 
Street 
type, 
a 
single friend with whom she 
has a codependent, resentful 

relationship. It’s additionally 
implied that the protagonist is 
trying to undo her memories of 
her emotionally cold parents, 
both of whom died a few 
months before the plot of the 
novel started. In this light, her 
decision to just try to remove 
herself totally has its merits 
and even comes across as 
eminently reasonable given the 
circumstances. The excessive, 
self-destructive rest she goes 
through 
is 
both 
a 
coping 
mechanism and a way (in her 
mind) of shaping herself into 
someone better, without the 
baggage of her previous life. 
There’s a sense in which her 
self-administered care is a way 
of forgetting, of purging, of 
becoming clean and pure. 
It’s clear that the scheme 
isn’t going to work, at least not 
in the way the narrator thinks 
it will. Moshfegh knows that 
you can’t rest yourself into 
wholeness, or even wellness, 
really. Even in my case, where 
I’m resting off an affliction 
of the body rather than of the 
spirit, I understand that rest 
can only do so much. When I 
return to class next week, I 
will have a degree of the same 
fatigue and aches, and I will 
still have more to do. This 
is the fundamental problem 
with rest, relaxation, so-called 
“self-care” and a good portion 
of “wellness” — that in the 
end you have to return to your 
life. It’s possible, in the end, 
that rest is only ever its own 
reward, something Moshfegh 
seems to understand: there’s 
a 
particular 
pleasure 
the 
protagonist feels throughout 
her voided months, somewhere 
between active and passive, 
sadistic and masochistic. The 
ambiguity of this desire forms 
the dramatic tension of this 
book. For now I can have long 
languid hours to stew in my 
dizzy mind, which feels to me 
the point.

The seven sins and the swag bags

Leonardo

Saoirse

and 
Quentin Tarantino: some of the biggest 
stars of the principal categories of the 2020 
Oscars who left without a golden man. 
However, these stars did not exactly leave 
empty-handed. In 2001, The Academy 
began administering swag bags for all of 
the nominees in the leading categories: 
Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Supporting 
Roles and Best Director. Recognized by 
their luxurious gifts and expensive cost, 
the bags were soon investigated by IRS, 
and The Academy officially put an end to 
the superfluous gifts. 
This is when Distinctive Assets stepped 
in. 
Unaffiliated with the Oscars, it is now 
Distinctive Assets who sponsors these 
swag bags for the top nominees. Those 
who accept are subject to an income tax, 
and in recent years the refusal of the swag 
bag has occurred. But the 2020 Oscar 
swag bags entail the most luxurious items 
of them all — how could anyone resist? 

Pride 
A tried-and-true initiation to “thank 
you” speeches usually follows along the 
lines of being so “humbled” to have been 
chosen. That they are undeserving. Small 
hints of hesitation may be disclosed, but 
all is forgotten when the gift bag arrives. 
The winners may take more pleasure 
with their goodies while the losers find 
solace on their 12-day “Scenic Eclipse” 
cruise, during their secluded getaway in 
a Spanish lighthouse or perhaps during 
one of their cosmetic treatments, worth 
around $25,000 in itself. 
How embarrassing it must be for 
Margot Robbie, Scarlett Johansson and 
Charlize Theron (all included in Forbes’ 
List 
of 
Highest-Paid 
Actresses 
this 
year) to be snubbed for their incredible 
performances. Money couldn’t buy them 

an Oscar, but it could buy stays at Wellness 
Resorts and phone calls with a Life Coach 
to help them push forward. 

Gluttony 
Though 
the 
nominees 
may 
be 
Hollywood 
stars 
leading 
entirely 
different lives to that of average citizens 
like us, all of us are connected by our 
universal appreciation for comfort food. 
Is there anyone in need of more comfort 
following the Oscars than the forgotten 
nominees? While there are McDonalds in 
Hollywood, what better way to welcome 
a win or cope with a loss than with Mad 
Mac Macarons, dinner for two at Flora’s 
Field Kitchen in Cabo, Mexico, a guided 
tasting of Coda’s Signature Chocolate 
edibles and more. 

Sloth 
Distinctive Assets ensure the nominees 
feel rewarded. Guaranteed relaxation is 
tacked on to the luxuries in the swag bags, 
persuading the stars to take a break. To 
let loose and enjoy themselves. After all, 
life is hard for millionaires. 

Lust 
The swag bag has all one could ever 
need to partake in rather than merely 
lustful activities. Romantic getaways, 
gold-infused bath bombs, trips to a 
destination spa, everything condoning 
pleasure and indulgence, sealed with a 
red ribbon and placed into the hands of 
the biggest faces in film today. 

Wrath 
Distinctive Assets knows just the route 
to take to prevent stars from speaking 
out. Dilute their anger with gifts, let 
them know they will get to take a prize 
home. Smother them with jokes about 
the lack of women nominations for Best 
Director and rather repetitive jokes 
about the lack of representation present 
in the nominations and the audience, 
preventing them from insisting that those 
with power do something about it. Find 
the fury and diminish it with hydrogen-
infused water and a brain-wave sensing 

meditation headband. Turn their anger 
into gratitude. Turn their wrath into 
acceptance. 

Envy 
Envy, our final sin, does not belong to 
the argued perpetrator. 
The final sin belongs to us. 
While the Oscars swag bags may not be 
the most moral signifiers of achievement 
for our beloved Hollywood stars, is it 

not our own envy that drives us to make 
these claims of dubious intent? These 
accusations are reeking with jealousy. I 
enviously type away, framing these stars 
and their acknowledgments, deeming 
them unworthy of such acclaim due to my 
own insecurity that my own achievements 
and impacts will never equate. But these 
celebrities are doing their job. A job we 
liken to worth, notability and success. A 
job we label as impressive, a necessary 
asset to the functioning of our society. 
Are we not the engine driving such award 
shows to take place? 
We are greedy for quality films, prideful 
in our original opinions, gluttonous for 
movie snacks, lazy as we stream from 
our beds, lustful in our engagement with 
the indecent scenes, angry when our top 
pick doesn’t win, and we. Are. Envious. 
Jealous in our recognition that we have 
such small odds of being on that stage. 
That we will never be gifted anything as 
salivating. 
Perhaps we are the most sinful of all.

The 2020 Oscar swag 
bags entail the most 
luxurious items of them 
all — how could anyone 
resist?

B-SIDE: COMMUNITY CULTURE

LILLY PEARCE
For The Daily


I love sinning as much as the next guy, but when it 
comes to literature and writing, there is one cardinal 
sin that truly irks me. The eighth deadly sin, more 
insidious than its seven predecessors, is the non sequitur 
(a conclusion or statement that does not logically follow 
from the previous argument or statement), the tangent, 
the digression. It’s funny and bizarre at first, but when it 
drags on for too long, it becomes grating. There is media, 
literary or otherwise, that is able to pull off going on 
tangents well, and then there is media that is not able to. 
But before delving into some of these sinful works, it’ll 
help to trace back the etymology of these words with the 
assistance of the Oxford English Dictionary, one of my 
favorite sites. My other most visited sites are isitchristmas.
com (by the way, it’s not Christmas today. Christmas 
celebrates the birth of the religious figure Jesus Christ, 
though the actual date of the historical Jesus’s birth was 
likely not Dec. 25. There are many theories as to why 
Dec. 25 was chosen as the day to celebrate this event, but 
it remains uncertain) and michigandaily.com ;). 
The usage of ‘non sequitur,’ for example, dates back 
to 1450, as used in Melbourne’s “Pilgramage Lyffe 
Manhode” to indicate some sort of article of clothing. It’s 
unclear how our current usage relates to this definition, 
but the OED indicates that a play on words may link 
the two. This, however, is uncertain. Philology and 
etymology can inspire deep appreciation for the beauty 
of our language, like why knight is pronounced “nite” 
instead of “kuh-nee-ght” (spoiler alert: we can thank the 
Normans for that. You may have heard of the Norman 
Conquest of England — not to be confused with the 
Lana Del Rey album titled Norman F*cking Rockwell. 
The title song of this album and the album itself were 
actually nominated for Grammys. Unfortunately, the 
song got snubbed, not unlike “Cats” got snubbed this 
year at the Oscars. And James Corden’s costumed 
appearance at the awards ceremony did nothing to 
assuage the pain I felt over “Cats” not being nominated 
for its phenomenal visual effects. In all honesty, the only 
comfort that could have soothed me was if every speaker 
who followed was dressed as an anthropomorphic cat, 
but, knowing the snobbery of the Academy Awards, this 
was unlikely. Nevertheless, other parts of the night did 

excite me. “Joker” winning awards for being too edgy 
was so exhilarating, and it should have won more. I will 
always believe “Joker” got snubbed for Best Picture, 
Best Director, Best Supporting Actress, Best Production 
Design, Best International Feature Film, Best Adapted 
Screenplay, Best Original Screenplay, Best Short Film, 
etc. because it was too deep and philosophical for the 
Academy to understand. At least Joaquin Phoenix stood 
up for what he believed in when he won his Oscar and 
talked about how angry he was that cow orphans exist. 
The Joker himself philosophizing on how we live in a 
society was inspiring. The world is so dark and twisted 
these days that it is so enlightening to have a voice of 
reason in these times of madness. His life really is a 
comedy… Much like the first half of the winner of the 
Best Picture category, “Parasite.” “Parasite” might have 
been shallow and meaningless compared to “Joker,” but 
I’ll accept it as the winner that “Joker” was supposed to 
be. But I digress… — which was the successful campaign 
to invade England marked by a decisive Norman victory 
at Hastings in 1066. The resulting influence of Norman-
French in this period permanently changed the English 
language), or why ‘yeet’ is a word. 
Words can undergo much more radical changes than 
the mere loss of syllables, of course. For example, did you 
know that the word ‘nice’ originally was meant to denote 
stupidity? I think a lot of things are “nice” in the sense 
that we use it today, but one of the nicest things on this 
planet is food. I’m not talking about bland white-people 
food, like casseroles or unseasoned chicken breasts, 
I’m talking about the good stuff, like Kraft Mac and 
Cheese, and that purple ketchup from the ‘90s. One way 
to really spice up your Kraft is to add some seasoning, 
some extra cheese, or some bacon bits. Personally, I 
love peppering my Kraft with cilantro, from the herb 
coriander. Apparently, it’s possible to blend cilantro into a 
dipping sauce and even a cocktail. I can’t imagine dipping 
my fries into cilantro sauce, but to each their own. I can 
appreciate the variety of preferences some can have. 
What I don’t appreciate is the lack of variety in 
a few of the University’s dining halls. South Quad 
in particular draws my ire. I love fruit, yet all that 
MDining can scrounge together is a limited selection 
of melons, pineapple, bananas, and apples. Where is 
the watermelon, the dragon fruit, the blueberries, the 
strawberries, the raspberries, the durian, the loquat, 
the cherimoya, the kumquat, the apricot, the coconut, 

the jujube, the cloudberry, the European blueberry, the 
damson, the gooseberry, the boysenberry and, most 
importantly, the kiwi? Where are my brown fuzzy little 
ovoids filled with green goodness? 
Speaking of kiwis, which are one of my favorite fruits, 
the Apteryx mantelli (the bird kiwi) is one of my favorite 
animals, and not just because these birds look like the 
fruit in question. I like the kiwi bird due to its association 

with the beautiful island country of New Zealand 
(Speaking of the Oscars, Taika Waititi, director of the 
Oscar-winning “Funny Heartwarming nazu Film” and 
the upcoming “Romeo and Juliet” adaptation, “Thor: 
Love and Thunder,” just so happens to be from New 
Zealand. Much like the kiwi bird, Waititi is emblematic 
of much of what New Zealand represents: beauty 
incarnate.); New Zealanders are even often called kiwis. 
Assigning names to groups or individuals is often an 

endeavor loaded with meaning, and oftentimes the name 
assigned holds cultural or personal significance. 

For fear of going off into a tangent, I won’t discuss 
the historical significance of names and titles, so I’ll list 
ten names and their etymological roots instead. The 
name ‘Julianna’ comes from the name ‘Julian,’ which 
traces its way back to the name ‘Julius,’ which denoted 
‘youth’; ‘One Directioner’ derives from the hit boy band 
‘One Direction,’ and is used to talk about fans of said 
band; Christ comes from the Greek Khristos, deriving 
from khriein, meaning ‘to anoint’; the Jewish/German 
name ‘Schlissel’ comes from an occupational title for a 
“maker of dishes”; ‘Reggie’ is a nickname for the longer 
name ‘Reginald,’ which comes from Old German and 
literally translates to ‘ruling with power’; ‘Belieber’ is a 
combination of the pop idol Justin ‘Bieber’ and the word 
‘believer,’ used to discuss fans of Justin Bieber— many 
artists have fans with humorous names, and even the fan 
bases of these artists often have names. One example is 
Beyonce’s fan base, dubbed the ‘Beyhive.’ 
Beyonce’s transcendence as a music artist is hardly 
done justice by this name, but it seems that this higher 
plane of talent runs in the family: I have recently 
discovered that Beyonce has a sister, Solange. Her latest 
album, When I Get Home, is a beautiful discussion of 
race and femininity. This duo of sisters is not novel in 
their familial talent, for they are preceded by the 19th 
century authors Charlotte and Emily Bronte. And, of 
course, the Brontes follow a literary period of satire, 
during which Laurence Sterne’s novel “The Life and 
Opinions of Tristram Shandy” was published, which is a 
perfect example of a piece of media built around the idea 
of tangents and non sequiturs. A more modern example 
of media that plays with non sequiturs is “Monty Python 
and Holy Grail”

B-SIDE: TV NOTEBOOK
The Real Housewives as the seven deadly sins

Imagine a reality television show devoid of sin. Oh, 
it’s already been cancelled. Now, imagine watching a 
reality television show, but this time, the disgustingly 
great feeling of schadenfreude is missing from your 
viewing experience. Not nearly as fun, right? Since the 
dawn of the genre, reality television and the idea of 
sin have been intrinsically intertwined. It’s easy to see 
why: Few reality shows have ever touched on subject 
matter extending outside of the realm of petty social 
in-fighting, sex and the fallout from having it, beach 
vacations and other exploitative pursuits. So depraved 
is the reputation of reality television and its viewers that 
it’s almost become a sin to admit to being a fan. 
But how could you not consider it to be a vice? 
The industry is comprised of channel after channel, 
program after program built upon the foundation of 
miserable people gathering together weekly (in person 
or on Twitter) to watch other people’s lives in some 
state of disarray. What ground do we, the fans, have to 
stand on? 
What I have found in my near-lifelong addiction 
to reality television is that, contrary to popular belief, 
what lies beneath most people’s fascination with reality 
television isn’t a superiority complex, but rather a level 
of underlying self-identification with the caricatured 
people on our screens. This is particularly true of the 
network providing some of the most nuanced and 
individualized depictions of American superficiality, 
Bravo. 
The seven deadly sins, or capital vices, are essentially 
our own natural tendencies in overdrive. We are all born 
with the ability to feel jealous or angry or like you’d fuck 
the shit out of Harry Styles. However, the sins provide 
a sort of exaggerated, cautionary framework to indicate 
when you have experienced too much of a good, bad 
thing. I see a striking parallel between this notion and 
how we view the stars of reality television in relation 
to ourselves. I almost see them as the contemporary 
versions of stock characters used in early theatre to 
espouse morals. In viewing the sensationalized versions 
of vulnerabilities we most likely already recognize 
within ourselves, in a sense, we are better able to reflect 
on and ground our own anxieties. 
No one likes to admit to their own sins, but we are 
self-aware enough to look for it in other people. Is 
this healthy? 100% no. Is this better than having no 
awareness of the origins of your feelings of inadequacy? 
That’s up to you to decide. But, until Bernie gives me 
free healthcare or CAPS finally remembers that I’ve 
already filled out that form before, I’ll continue to self-
medicate with the icky comfort Bravo provides. 
A close reading of something as seemingly trivial as 
reality television, specifically something as notorious as 
the “Real Housewives” franchise, may be off-putting 
— I’m keenly aware of how this could be viewed. But, 
you’ve already made it this far, why not stick around for 
some armchair psychoanalysis? 
Here are the Real Housewives as the seven deadly 
sins. 

PRIDE: A tie — LuAnn de Lesseps (“The Real 
Housewives of New York”) and Karen Huger (“The 
Real Housewives of Potomac”) 

There are many ways to define pride. Webster’s 
defines it as a “high or inordinate opinion of one’s own 
dignity, importance, merit or superiority,” but it could 
also be pretty well summed up through the act of brow-
beating everyone in your life to refer to you as “Countess.” 
Unironically. To be fair, once LuAnn de Lesseps of “The 
Real Housewives of New York” was divorced from her 
now ex-husband, Count Alexandre de Lesseps, she did 
stop using her courtesy title. After she was forced to do 
so. Seven years after the divorce papers were signed. 
While LuAnn serves as a reminder of a bygone era 
of early reality television pridefulness — when stars 
actually believed that they could dupe audiences into 
looking past the very apparent shortcomings of their 
lives via performative haughtiness — Karen Huger, the 
self-proclaimed “Grand Dame of Potomac,” represents 
the future trajectory of this cautionary tale.
The more I mull over the topic, the more I believe 
that the act of forcing others to call you by a fabricated 
title of nobility might just be the best metric to gauge 
one’s pridefulness, as well as his or her grasp on reality. 
Huger prides herself on two things: her marriage to 
the “Black Bill Gates” and her wigs. Ironically, both of 
these things have been weaponized against her to poke 
holes in her delusions of grandeur. Her husband, Ray 
Huger, more Papa Smurf than Bill Gates, was outed 
for “personally [owing] nearly $1.5 million in back-due 
federal taxes, and his software company owes more 
than 3 million.” As for her wigs, please do me a favor and 
Google the video of her wig falling off mid-argument, 
and see her attempt to act as though it is not happening. 
You won’t regret it. 
Karen refuses to make substantial comment on 
either of these matters, choosing instead to pick fights 
about her fragrance line (that is still missing from 
department store shelves). Unlike during the early 
years of the “Housewives” franchise, now, everyone 
can see through the illusion of elitism propped up by the 
Bravo network’s checkbook. But, the beauty of the pride 
archetype is the hilarity that comes out of their efforts 
to convince us otherwise.

WRATH: 
Lisa 
Vanderpump 
(“The 
Real 
Housewives of Beverly Hills”) 

Unlike pride, wrath is an easier sin to unknowingly 
fall prey to. Anger is a slippery slope, but wrath only 
comes when you prolong the effects of the initial burn 
and then weaponize it to hurt the person who hurt you 
instead of acknowledging the feeling in the moment. 
Using her British origins as a crutch for her passive 
aggression, Lisa Vanderpump of “The Real Housewives 
of Beverly Hills” has made an art form of grudge-
holding. Lisa was likened to chess master Bobby Fischer 
one time for her careful manipulation of others. Eight 
years later, we are still talking about it. No comment on 
whether or not she sees the irony of accusing others of 
being “real” chess masters for scapegoating her as the 
chess master. Though I am admittedly a fan of both a 
good grudge and Vanderpump, she has never been able 
to hold down a considerable friendship on the show for 
more than two consecutive seasons. Maybe she’s better 
off taking a note from other “Housewives” franchises 
and just escalating to physical fighting. 

GREED: Another tie — Teresa Guidice (“The 
Real Housewives of New Jersey”) and Phaedra 

Parks (“The Real Housewives of Atlanta”) 

Easily the most recognizable of the “Housewives” 
couples, you’ve probably seen Teresa and Joe Guidice 
on the cover of a magazine when the line at the grocery 
store is taking too long. Whether the story is covering 
rumors about Joe, Teresa’s infidelity or Teresa’s rise 
to the top of the bodybuilding world, they can’t seem 
to stay out of the news. You may think I’m going to be 
making the argument that they represent the downside 
of when one is too greedy for the spotlight — but you’d 
be wrong. The Guidices represent greed because of 
their 39-count conviction for charges of wire, bank and 
bankruptcy fraud. 
It would be inaccurate to include a section on greed 
and not memorialize the first couple in franchise 
history to do hard time while still signed onto the show, 
however, I have a conscience and know that Teresa and 
her four daughters are going through an even harder 
time right now dealing with Joe’s deportation back to 
Italy. The number one rule of the Housewives is that 
“you don’t bring family into this,” so like my televised 
icons, I will also choose to situationally invoke this 
principle and give her a break. 
After all, at least Teresa copped to her charges — 
unlike Phaedra Parks from “The Real Housewives 
of Atlanta.” Who can forget that one time Phaedra’s 
husband, Apollo, was convicted on charges of 
producing and cashing fraudulent insurance checks 
and Phaedra apparently “knew nothing” about it? 
And can you believe the timing — just when they were 
almost finished building their extravagant new home? 
The interesting thing about these twin displays of greed 
is that both the Guidice and Parks families began their 
tenure on their respective shows espousing the traits 
associated with pride, and only turned to crime when 
it became clear that they could no longer keep up with 
Joneses — or their castmates with more money. 

LUST: Ramona Singer (“The Real Housewives of 
New York”) 

Bravo fans (who I keep addressing, but know aren’t 
actually reading this), I know there are plenty of other 
options in the Housewives arsenal who probably would 
have been simpler picks: Brandi Glanville, Claudia 
Jordan, even Ramona’s blonde-in-crime, Sonja Morgan. 
But the thing about lust is that the sin of it lies more in the 
excessive and obsessive act of desiring*, not necessarily 
the catharsis that comes in the follow through. 
*The Catholic Church gets final say, though.
The other women have demonstrated the follow 
through, so consequently, the housewife who serves 
as the cautionary tale of this sin is the one who would 
never cop to the charge, Ramona Singer. For context, in 
earlier seasons, Ramona was a staunch traditionalist. 
She was the woman who, because she was married, 
demonized the single women in the friend group and 
self-indulgently used her own marriage to support the 
archaic idea that if you can keep your man happy, he 
will stay. Then Ramona’s husband Mario publicly left 
her for a woman 30 years her junior. Go figure. 
While this karmic retribution could have provided a 
learning experience for Ramona, she ultimately did not 
take this route. Maybe it’s because she’s insecure about 
reaching her 60s. Maybe it’s because her daughter 
doesn’t visit enough. Maybe old habits die hard and after 

you’ve internalized misogyny for over 50 years, you just 
can’t break the habit. Either way, Ramona embodies 
lust in its most exaggerated form, not only because of 
her continued undying need to prioritize the pursuit of 
a significant other above all else, but because she also 
has developed a cringe-worthy pattern of hitting on, 
sending drinks to and publicly making out with men 
who have already been claimed by her close friends. 

GLUTTONY: 
Kandi 
Buruss 
(“The 
Real 
Housewives of Atlanta”) 

To me, gluttony isn’t that big of a deal. Yeah, I do ask 
for double rice at Chipotle — you wanna fight about it? 
Honestly, I don’t think many people retain the nuance 
to be able to delve into what connotes gluttony without 
veering fully into the territory of fatphobia, so to save 
us all the headache, this categorization will not be a 
condemnation. 
Kandi Burruss is a cut to the chase kind of woman. 
As she said prophetically in her season seven tagline, 
“I’m not about the drama. Don’t start none, won’t be 
none.” She’s earned a reputation for being one of the 
most prolific songwriters in R&B (penning TLC’s 
“No Scrubs” amongst many others), and being the one 
Housewife to always locate the food or snacks when the 
cast is away on a girls’ trip. And for that, I give her props. 

ENVY: LeAnn Locken (“The Real Housewives of 
Dallas”) 

Yes, there really is a LeAnn and a LuAnn within the 
“Housewives” franchise. And what about it? Envy, like 
greed and lust, is characterized by an uncontrollable 
desire for something that other people have. And 
though she’s open — very open — about her humble 
upbringing as a carnie, you’d think she’d be a bit more 
transparent about her feelings of inadequacy toward 
her castmates. 
Instead of outwardly expressing a desire for more, 
LeAnn claims she’s “happy” with what she has while 
simultaneously planning a wedding she can’t afford 
and blackmailing (on camera) an upscale wedding 
dress designer to give her a gown for free. However, 
the sin isn’t inherent in the striving for a better life. Her 
sin isn’t even marrying a cop who wears a permanent 
eye patch. Like Watergate, the true sin comes in the 
cover-up. Rather than honesty, LeAnn opts for reactive 
(and misplaced) ridicule of friends’ things as being 
low quality — like castmate Kary Brittingham’s seven-
bedroom, waterfront beach villa in Careyes, Mexico 
that she claimed was “too small” and had “too many 
stairs.” As a comparison, LeAnn did not provide food at 
her wedding. 

SLOTH: Any of the one-season wonders that 
gave zero effort to produce drama

Last, but definitely not least, sloth is characterized 
by “an excessive laziness or the failure to act and utilize 
one’s talents.” You can see where I’m going with this. 
Who feels self-important enough to sign on for a reality 
show and then proceed to act as though they are above 
the genre by providing viewers with absolutely no 
drama, no effort and no vulnerability? I won’t name 
names, because I honestly can’t remember most of 
them.

The seven deadly sins...but make them fashionable

B-SIDE: STYLE

I set Greed in the 1910s, because this era 
seemed to be obsessed with gaining wealth 
and social standing. A confining dress of 
gold with flaps modeled after Faberge Eggs, 
paired with an extensive amount of heavy 
jewelry are the featured parts of this outfit.

LUST

Lust is set in the 2010 #MeToo era. I envisioned 
a Harvey Weinstein-esque male authority figure, 
using his power to sexually assault women. I 
wanted to make this man as disgusting and 
sleazy as possible, uncaring of who he exposes 
himself to. The animal paired with Lust is a 
cow, so assless chaps were a must, especially 
with a cow udder protruding from the front.

GLUTTONY

I 
decided 
to 
focus 
on 
the 
idea 
of 
overindulgence 
in the form of alcohol instead of food for 
Gluttony. This 1920s flapper has spilled 
alcohol down her dress, and dons a cape made 
of various alcohol labels and a pig face fan.

SLOTH

I took inspiration for Sloth from the 
1970s, since that era is often associated 
with pot-smoking hippies. I pictured 
this androgynous look as something 
they rolled out of bed in. I heavily 
featured the goat in the horn shoulder 
pads and go-go (or goat-goat) boots.

PRIDE

I thought Pride could be embodied 
perfectly through the 1940s, during the 
height of war. I imagined a veteran still 
full of pride for his country, despite having 
suffered immensely. His leg is replaced 
with a rifle, and his uniform made of 
Tiffany glass is shattered from bullet holes.

I set Envy in the 1950s because of the cultural 
tendency to try to portray everything as 
perfect, from clothes to home life. The lack 
of artistry on my part really comes out in this 
piece, especially with the dog pelt around 
her neck, but I tried. Her headband is a nod 
to Roy Lichtenstein.

WRATH

Wrath is a classic 1990s grunge girl for 
obvious reasons. The makeup is smeared, 
the clothes are ripped and the hood of the 
flannel tutu dress is a bear to bite all of her 
enemies.

ENVY

The “Seven Deadly Sins” is such an iconic image that even my theatrical scenic design class incorporated it into 
our lesson plan. The final project of Introduction to Scenic Design (THTREMUS 240) taught by Rob Murphy 
asked us to create costume designs for each sin, incorporating the animal and color related to the sin in mythology, 
as well as an artist of our choosing. I’m no artist, as you will see from the frequent eraser marks and poorly drawn 
features, but the project was a fascinating way to explore these classic vices and what impact they have on society.

During a drive to Ann Arbor 
with three other people in 
my car, I asked each of my 
companions to queue two songs 
on Spotify for us to listen to 
along the way. Two were quick 
to add their songs, but one of 
my friends was hesitant to add 
something to the queue. “I 
don’t know what to add, just 
skip me,” she insisted, but I 
demanded two songs from her. 
So she reluctantly queued two 
songs.
I suspected her hesitance 
stemmed from embarrassment 
about her taste in music — I 
wagered a guess it was K-pop. 
The 
first 
track, 
a 
bossa-
nova-esque indie ballad, was 
perfectly inoffensive to her 
audience of artsy people in 
the car. Then the second track 
played: “dayfly” by Korean R&B 
singer Dean.
“Were you nervous because 
you 
like 
music 
in 
other 
languages?” 
I 
immediately 
asked. I told her, I may not 
follow K-pop, but even I have 
listened to Dean, and I think 
his music slaps. Only then did 

she spill her interest in Korean 
R&B 
and 
other 
genres 
of 
international music.
The last few years have seen 
so many hobbies that were once 
considered “nerdy” or “lame” 
become mainstream and cool. 
Video 
games 
are 
vanilla. 
Mid-40s office workers who 
couldn’t name a single Pokémon 
before 2015 are often the most 
devoted of Pokémon Go players. 
Just five years ago Reddit was 

considered (by its users) to be a 
geeky website you couldn’t talk 
to other people about, but today 
it’s almost as normal as using 
Facebook — it usually hovers 
in the top 10 or 20 most visited 
sites on the web nowadays.
Still, there’s a hesitance to 
fully embrace some of these 

things. 
Many 
people 
won’t 
adopt the label “gamer” or 
admit 
the 
true 
extent 
to 
which they play video games. 
Dungeons & Dragons players 
remain 
fairly 
low-key. 
The 
breakout popularity of BTS has 
still not fully normalized open 
interest in K-pop, with many 
listeners opting to keep it on 
the down-low. Reading young 
adult novels has seemed to 
constantly fluctuate between 

feeling “totally normal” and 
“utterly uncool.” 
I’ll never forget my chief 
paranoia of 2012: hiding my 
obsession with anime. There 
was 
nobody 
going 
around 
saying “anime is for dweebs,” 
but the pressure to hide my 
hobby was like a heavy weight 

over 
my 
shoulders. 
Anime 
turned out to be just a phase for 
me, one that I would keep secret 
for several more years. Then at 
some point in college I finally 
stopped caring and covered my 
bedroom in posters of anime I 
hadn’t watched in six or seven 
years. It’s almost like I needed 
to make up for all those years 
repressing my hobby.
I know I wasn’t the only one 
hiding it, and the feeling of 
embarrassment still exists: A 
plea for subtle anime wallpapers 
was posted on Reddit just one 
year ago (The caption reads: 
“I need some new phone and 
desktop wallpapers, but im 
not going to expose myself as 
a weeb to everyone i know just 
yet.”) Though a sense of shame 
seems to run particularly high 

in the anime community, I can 
imagine some K-pop fans or 
D&D players similarly looking 
for subtle ways to express their 
passions 
without 
“outing” 
themselves.
When I think deeply about 
it, I struggle to pinpoint what 
exactly is so “different” about 
these “nerdier” interests. Maybe 
the perceived obnoxiousness of 
their fans, but there are just 
as many bad apples in more 
mainstream 
fanbases 
like 
sports. So what’s responsible 
for this overbearing sense of 
shame and embarrassment?
I think most people are just 
looking to feel welcome and 
accepted, even at the expense 
of showing who they really are. 
Society has trained us to feel 
validated by the thoughts of 

others. Hiding our true selves 
is an unfortunate consequence.
I say stop hiding what you 
love. Taking pride in it is not a 
cardinal sin.
As I’ve grown older I’ve 
sought to shift the dynamic. 
Today I prefer to make the 
things that matter to me loud 
and clear as a sort of litmus test. 
I’ll proudly blast “Flamingo” 
by Kero Kero Bonito out my 
car windows, and if someone 
were to give me a weird look 
for listening to music sung in 
Japanese, then they probably 
aren’t worth getting to know. 
On the same token, don’t take 
your anime posters down before 
bringing your Tinder match 
into the bedroom. If they think 
it’s weird, then they’re probably 
not worth another date.

Watching anime is not a 
sin: On media that’s uncool

The experience of devoting 
nearly two hours of one’s life 
to 
watching 
an 
episode 
of 
“The Bachelor” is not only 
transformatory, it is blissfully 
sinful. On both sides of the screen, 
people are being as unabashedly 
awful as they please. Some 
background on the show for 
those who aren’t familiar: “The 
Bachelor” is a reality TV show 
where a cohort of 20+ women 
is winnowed down to “the 
one” by the bachelor himself, a 
single man “dating” all of these 
women at once. He chooses who 
continues on the show by giving 
the contestants a rose — if you 
don’t receive a rose, you go home. 
It’s a patently ridiculous concept 
that gamifies love and dating in 
a way that would be awful if we, 
as a collective fanbase, didn’t 
all agree that it was a complete 
charade. Almost none of the 
couples from “The Bachelor” or 
its spinoffs, “The Bachelorette” 
or “Bachelor in Paradise,” end 
up still together a few months 
after the show has ended. And 
yet 
every 
single 
contestant 
walks into the competition the 
first night claiming earnestly 
that this man, who is dating 20 
other women, is truly the love 
of their life and their future 
husband. I don’t mean to belittle 
these women — among them 
this season are an attorney, a 
marketing executive, a foster 
parent recruiter and a nursing 
student — but the entire premise 
of the show essentially destines 
any relationship for failure. 

Let me start by saying that 
I love “The Bachelor” in a way 
that should probably be a little 
bit more ironic than it actually 
is. As a snobby middle schooler, 
I believed myself above the other 
girls in my grade who gushed 
about the bachelor and regaled 
the drama from last Monday 
night’s episode. This was my 
first excursion into this sinful 
experience, because while I 
thought I was better than the 
people who were amused by 
such petty drama, I was actually 
exhibiting the first deadly sin: 
pride. The truth is, no one is 
above watching “The Bachelor.” 
You may think you’re better 
than the men and women who 
go on the show, but the truth is, 
you’re letting your pride hold 
you back from an experience 
that will liberate you from the 
stressful drama of actual daily 
life and release you into a world 
where the only thing you have to 
worry about is whether Hannah 
Ann intentionally stole Kelsey’s 
champagne. 
We 
all 
deserve 
a break from the real world 
sometimes, and “The Bachelor” 
is the perfect way to indulge in 
our sins. First of all, watching 
someone else act in a blatantly 
awful way when it has no actual 
consequences 
is 
genuinely 
incredible. I relish the moment 
that one of the women gets up 
from the couch and walks over 
to Peter to say “Can I borrow 
you for a minute?” because I 
know for a fact that it will cause 
drama that will have absolutely 
no effect on me or the world 
whatsoever.
The women on this show 
consistently commit sins that 
are nearly textbook in their 
definitions. 
Greed: 
wanting 

Peter all to themselves. Envy: 
watching other girls date the 
same man they are dating. Wrath: 
(allegedly) stealing another girl’s 
champagne to drink with Peter. 
Pride: to quote one contestant, 
Kelley, “The other girls are 
children… Just look at me. I’m 
an attorney.” Lust: this one goes 
without saying. The key to “The 
Bachelor’s” success, however, is 
not just the sins on the screen. 
It is the fact that the show 
implicates its viewers in those 
sins. Watching an episode from 
a place of complete moral high 
ground would be not only boring, 
it would be painful. Luckily for 
us, it is impossible to watch it 
from a moral high ground. By 
watching the show, the viewer is 
absolutely implicated in the sin 
that they are watching. This is 
the beauty of reality television: 
we must accept, or at least play 
along with, the insane rules 
that govern the show. That 
acceptance instantly enmeshes 
us in the same moral fabric of 
the bachelor and the women 
on the show. Not only are we 
committing gluttony, by eating 
potato chips and Twizzlers, and 
sloth, by sitting in one spot and 
doing nothing productive for two 
hours, but we are susceptible to 
every sin committed on screen. 
But ultimately, there are worse 
ways to sin. Why should we feel 
bad for completely indulging in 
our baser natures for two hours 
a week on Mondays? Let yourself 
get completely enveloped in the 
unreal reality of “The Bachelor.” 
Care deeply, for two hours, about 
things that do not matter. Come 
out on the other side, laughing at 
yourself for getting so invested, 
knowing you’ll do it again next 
week.

The seven deadly sins: 
‘The Bachelor’ Edition

Mead has unflattering image 
problems, and the most common 
imagery may be what you think of 
at your local renaissance fair. That 
drink is overly sweet yet insipid 
— a drink you would reluctantly 
sip as you wistfully pine for a 
drier, sharp-tasting beer. You 
may wonder how an ingredient 
as aromatic and complex as honey 
can be reduced to what amounts 
to little more than alcoholic, 
sweet and yellow water.
Compared to its more popular 
cousins, beer and wine, mead 
has yet to grab the attention of 
mainstream culture. But the 
production and quality of craft 
mead has exploded within the 
past decade, with some of the 
finest meads coming from the 
state of Michigan. At the center 
of that boom is Schramm’s Mead, 
the storefront of the eponymous 
Ken Schramm: author of “The 
Compleat 
Meadmaker” 
and 
referred to by many mead-
brewers as “The Godfather of 
Mead.” 
Schramm’s Mead is located 
within 
a 
cluster 
of 
well-
established 
restaurants 
of 
Ferndale in the heart of Nine Mile 
Road. You may find the storefront 
of Schramm’s quite comely aside 
from the garish American stars 
with its blue background painted 
on its side facing the parking lot. 
Walking in, you find the interior 
is anything but garish; you are 
greeted by a warm, cozy bar and 
tasting room and knowledgeable 
bartenders passionate about the 
meads they have on tap.
Before 
I 
encountered 
Schramm’s Mead, I had been 
indulging in sweeter dessert 
wines such as the 2014 - 2016 
batches of Chateau Ste. Michelle 
Riesling. It’s a surprisingly crisp 
but light drink — a wine that 
almost reminds you of a dry-
sweet cider made from Granny 
Smiths as opposed to a wine made 
of white grapes. This is a drink 
you savor on its own, perfect for 
a night-in while binging Netflix. 
Yet a dessert wine like this feels 
somewhat incomplete. You crave 
full-bodied drinks which possess 
a thick, luscious mouthfeel that 
complements 
their 
intensely 
sweet and fruity profile. What 
you crave, in essence, is an alcohol 
unicorn to provide the perfect 
finish to your day.
A brief look into Schramm’s 
tasting 
menu 
shows 
that 

Schramm’s 
specializes 
in 
melomels, meads which include 
fruits along with honey in the 
fermentation process. You may be 
confused about this kind of mead 
if your previous experiences with 
mead were solely with ghostly 
renaissance fair varieties. Given 
the bias towards berries, you may 
wonder whether these meads 
have some passing resemblance to 
young ruby port wines or perhaps 
even to a Korean raspberry wine 
called bokbunja.
Among 
the 
selections 
are 
the raspberry mead and the 
blackberry 
mead, 
excellent 

starting points for your adventure. 
Upon first taste, you may be 
stupefied by the sheer intensity 
of honey flavor and aroma that 
sings throughout each sip. The 
tartness of either the raspberry 
or the blackberry alleviates the 
heavy-hitting sweetness of the 
honey while also complementing 
the honey with a fruity and jam-
like quality. Taking a second 
sip, 
you 
are 
intrigued 
and 
amazed at how the honey and 
the berry harmoniously express 
their 
individuality 
without 
compromise, similar to the proud, 
unabashed confidence of Shakira 
and J.Lo performing “Let’s Get 
Loud” at the LIV Superbowl 

halftime.
Following the raspberry or 
blackberry mead, you may be 
piqued by the boldly-named “The 
Statement” — a sour cherry mead. 
Like the raspberry and blackberry 
meads, the flavor of the Batalon 
cherries melds inconspicuously 
with the sweetness of the honey. 
Fans of sour flavors may rejoice 
to find that compared to the 
raspberry or blackberry meads, 
the sourness of the Batalon 
cherries takes the center stage 
compared to the sweetness of 
the honey. “The Statement” is 
reminiscent of the 1976 London 
live performance of “Europa” 
by Carlos Santana, in which the 
sour tartness of the cherries 
melodically riffs across your 
tongue in the midst of honey-
like synthesizer melodic chord 
progressions.
But perhaps no night is complete 
without 
trying 
Schramm’s 
“Heather” mead. Unlike most of 
the other selections, “Heather,” 
as its name suggests, consists 
solely of Scottish Heather honey. 
In contrast to many of Schramm’s 
offerings, “Heather” provides a 
flavor reminiscent of vanilla and 
oak barrels — somewhat similar to 
a whiskey, yet packed with a honey 
aroma bordering on caramel. 
Consider the possibility of the 
“Heather” as a whiskey substitute 
in an old-fashioned, or instead 
simply enjoy “Heather” for the 
drink that it is — a showstopping, 
exclamatory punctuation to end 
your mead-drinking experience.
You may be concerned that a 
prerequisite to enjoying a bottle 
of Schramm’s for your nightly 
Netflix binges would involve 
driving to Ferndale. Luckily, 
Schramm’s is available across 
many locations within the state 
of Michigan, including Ann Arbor 
stores such as Blue Front and Plum 
Market. Not all of Schramm’s 
products are available in these 
locations. Notably, the “Heather” 
is disappointingly missing from 
these available meads.
In the cold, overcast winters 
of the Midwest, any reminders 
of warmth and sun provide a 
welcome respite to an otherwise 
dreary day. During the winter, 
Schramm’s Mead is a powerful 
but demure reminder of the 
warmth and joy that lies ahead 
of the harrowing weather. In the 
height of spring and summer, 
Schramm’s is a celebration of 
nature’s luscious bounty that 
flourishes 
throughout 
Pure 
Michigan.
Schramm’s Mead is located at 
327 W Nine Mile Rd, Ferndale, MI 
48220.

culture. But

and quality of 
craft mead has

and cool


The showcase of Richard 
Quinn’s 
Spring 
2019 
line 
opened 
with 
what 
many 
fashion publications would 
call a “luxe morphsuit.” The 
first four models were covered 
from head to toe in skin-tight 
black velvet accompanied by 
tonal tulle cocktail frocks, 
commanding silk capes, a pair 
of lilac pants and a striking 
blue satin a-line dress, covered 
in a jeweled vine of ruby red 
roses (with a matching bag!). 
The initial onslaught acted 
as something of a palette-
cleansing agent for the looks 
to come, the first of which 
were an abrupt change in 
tone. That’s not to say that the 
collection 
lacked 
cohesion. 
In fact, different ideas were 
neatly tied together through 
a range of silhouettes, but 
the “luxe morphsuit” concept 
was particularly interesting 
because of the jarring, almost 
sinister allure it held. The 
models were obfuscated by 

this stylistic choice, and it 
afforded them a kind of agency 
that can only be wielded by 
playing the role of a silent 
actor.
Quinn’s masked foray fits 
neatly into a larger movement 
of labels tapping into concepts 
first brought forward by the 
Dada movement in the early 

20th century. Perhaps the 
first to introduce this idea 
since Maison Martin Margiela 
in 2009, Gucci debuted a 
model covered in crystals 
in the fall of 2017. Demna 
Gvasalia’s Balenciaga, a house 
with a reputation for pushing 
stylistic directions to their 
absolute 
extreme, 
posted 
photos on their Instagram 
of models similarly covered 
in 
pantyhose 
as 
well 
as 
digitally manipulated images 
that either multiply figures 
to the point where they are 
rendered unrecognizable or 
do away with them entirely. 
The first and most notable 
installment of these is a 
digitally manipulated closeup 
of their blockbuster knife boot 
in a compiled money print. 
The 
sharply 
pointed 
boot 
lurches toward the viewer in a 
penguin-toed fashion, only to 
vanish into thin air at the mid 
calf. Another photo features 
a 
house-branded 
“Space 
Hunters” tee and a pair of suit 
pants hanging over a drying 
rack with a model creeping out 
from underneath. The photos 
might 
feel 
categorically 
dissimilar, but they instill that 
same sense of relative unease 
as Quinn’s morphsuits, which 
they achieve by tapping into 
the uncanny. 
We all have agreed notions 
of what reality is supposed 
to look like and they become 
linked to metrics of mental 
clarity and basic safety. Dada 
artists like Marcel Duchamp, 
Hannah Höch and Sophie 
Taeuber were among the first 
to introduce the idea that 
those notions can be upended 
through art. By creating work 
that 
undermines 
universal 
norms, like the expectation 
that a pair of boots will be 
connected to a pair of legs or 
that clothing will be modeled 
by a person and not a faceless 
morph, the viewer is asked 
not only to question the work 
itself but the environment 
surrounding them. As one 
might expect, exploring the 
strange vegetations and fears 
that occupy the unknown can 
also be a chance to consider 
or call attention to existing 
problems in the sociopolitical 
sphere.
RuPaul’s Drag Race Season 
10 finalist Asia O’Hara was 
seen alongside her sisters 
during one of her pre-finale 
appearances covered in black 
mesh, a protruding rib cage, 
ruched 
knee-length 
dress 

and matching halo crown. 
Speaking on her sartorial 
choice, O’Hara told London’s 
Metro “I think there comes 
a point in the competition 
where 
some 
non-majority 
queens or non-perfect queens 
start to fade and disappear 
into 
the 
background. 
My 
dress and my attire was 
just a visual representation 
of exactly how I was being 
perceived.” Around this time, 
Asia was also receiving death 

threats for suggesting that 
4th runner-up Miz Cracker 
shouldn’t 
continue 
in 
the 
competition during episode 
10. It should be noted that Asia 
was the only Black queen (or 
queen of color, for that matter) 
to have made it to the final 
four and has been vocal about 
the disparity in treatment she 
has received in comparison to 
the other finalists. In visually 
reflecting 
her 
experiences, 
ranging from lack of credit 
to virulent aggression, her 
look helped forward the long 
overdue conversation around 
race issues in the Drag Race 
fandom. 
Vehicles of Dadaism remain 
a piercing and cogent tool 
at the disposal of artists 
regardless of their chosen 
medium, 
whether 
that 
pertains to getting onlookers 
to sit up in their seats during 
fashion week or addressing 
issues that permeate society as 
a whole. In choosing to isolate 
themselves, Asia, Quinn and 
Demna are in good company.

Daily Style Columnist

At three in the morning at 
some point during the winter of 
freshman year, Pizza House was 
just a quick, frostbitten walk away. 
I had avoided this destination 
many times before, but now I was 
swept up by the masses to this 
greasy heaven for the buzzed. I see 
the archway to the establishment 
and shudder at what will become 
of me tomorrow, a month from 
now, years away. Visions of weight 
gain creep through my mind in 
between shrieks of excitement 
from the night.
My group of eight friends, most 
of whom I begged to go back to the 
dorms with me, dramatically ogle 
pizzas and shakes on the menu. I 
think, “Oh god. What am I going to 
order? I can’t not order anything, 
because no one likes that person. 
I can’t order any of the things 
everyone else wants to order 
because then I will lose all control 
and become a giant blueberry.” I 
hear my mother in the back of my 
head warning about how anything 
eaten past 4 p.m. just turns to fat.
As the waitress skillfully makes 
her way around the loud, crowded 
table, I begin to sober up. I see my 
aunt who is constantly struggling 
with her weight in between Diet 

Cokes and donuts; she ended up 
alone, living with her parents. 
My other aunt got a divorce after 
having kids because her husband 
couldn’t take her changing body. 
My grandmother always told me 
how crucial keeping your weight 
down is. My father recalls with 
pride when my mother was able to 
lose 25 pounds in two months for 
her sister’s wedding. 
I 
hoped 
to 
avoid 
any 
conversation 
about 
the 
appearance of my body with my 
family by upholding the routine 
set for me by my mother before I 
went to college. I would avoid all 
food past 4 p.m. and put all sweets 
and carbs under intense scrutiny 
before consuming. Above all else, 
for the love of God, no late-night 
eating. 
Throughout my teenage years, I 
attended ballet class and rehearsal 
from 12 p.m. to 10 p.m. every day. 
One night, I came home, sweaty 
and exhausted from the day. I 
picked out a peach in the kitchen 
and collapsed on the couch to 
enjoy it. My mother was also on 
the couch.
“What do you think you’re 
doing?”
“Eating a peach. I’m hungry.”
“It’s only going to turn to fat, 
you know.”
“I’m hungry. I’ve been sweating 
and exercising for the past five 
hours.”

“Then drink water.”
I didn’t budge. I took a bite and 
felt the juice run down my chin. 
She glared at me.
“Throw it away.” She said. I 
didn’t move. 
“What? Do you want to be 
obese like Aunt Jenny? It’s in your 
genetics. You’re already halfway 
there anyways. I’m just trying to 
help you. Throw it away!” She said. 
What was I doing sabotaging 
myself? Didn’t I want to be 
beautiful? Didn’t I want to find a 
husband that would love me? No 
one could truly love someone fat. 
And then there was my career to 
worry about. I wanted to be an 
actress. It would be significantly 
more difficult to get a job if I 
gained weight. My father would be 
disappointed in me. I began to cry, 
but I threw the peach away. 
As my mother’s screams echoed 
in my mind, I remembered all the 
other times we would go out to 
dinner, and she would mock me 
for whatever I chose, even if it 
was the salad, because she had 
the discipline to not eat anything, 
meanwhile I would have to work 
off the croutons at the gym later. 
As the waitress made her way 
to me, I panicked. I had never 
eaten so late in my life, let alone 
at a place where everything was 
forbidden. 
“And what would you like?” She 
asked. 

“I’ll have a cup of fruit and some 
water, please.”
Everyone at the table went 
silent. Everyone else had gotten 

towering, extravagant milkshakes. 
“I’ll just split the pizza with you 
guys.”
“Just get a shake. They’re so 
good here. It will be worth it, I 
promise.” My friend urged me.
I could hear my mother warning 
me against it. I would never be 
loved, only pitied. I would never 
be successful. 

“Okay,” I said. “I’ll have the 
smallest chocolate shake you 
have.”
Well, that was the end to those 
voices of shame in my mind. Upon 
completion of my drink, I floated 
back to my dorm. Everyone was 
full and blissfully unaware of 
whatever we ate at the restaurant. 
I went to ballet the next morning 
and looked the same. 
A couple months later, I met 
a boy who I was blindingly in 
love with. He was a senior and a 
stoner, but also a connoisseur of 
ordering the most extravagant and 
delicious things at restaurants. 
The first time I spent the night, he 
suggested we go grab some food 
at around one in the morning. 
Fleetwood Diner smelled like 
burned butter and burgers. He 
ordered us milkshakes, fries, 
hippy 
hash, 
sandwiches 
and 
pancakes. I could feel the voice 
of my mother screaming as she 
melted into nothing in the back of 
my mind. 
I ate more than he did. We ate 
and ate and ate, and laughed, and 
ate until I was in a food coma. We 
would work it off later, anyways. 
I was getting used to this whole 
late-night eating thing. It looked 
good on me, too. I filled out my 
jeans and bras. I developed cute 
little cheeks people could pinch, 
and above all else, I was really, 
really happy. 

I enjoyed the time I spent with 
my friends more at restaurants. 
I enjoyed the time after eating; I 
enjoyed indulging in it. 
I remember going back home 
after the first year and giving my 
mom a hug. I never realized how 
frail she was. We were the same 
weight, but I felt like I had to be 
very gentle with her. 
Now, I’m a senior and have 
figured out how to balance my 
eating habits. Through both a 
nutrition class and learning how 
to enjoy life more, it seems strange 
to recall all the times my mom 
projected those toxic values onto 
me. She is a good person — I don’t 
want to put my mom completely 
on blast — it’s just a difficult world 
to live in as a woman. She came 
into her womanhood as anorexia 
was being glorified in the media. 
Women still live in a world of 
unattainable beauty standards. In 
a world of implants and photoshop, 
it’s easy to get lost comparing 
yourself to others. However, it 
really doesn’t bother me much. 
I think what’s most important is 
how you feel instead of how you 
look. Thankfully, I have amazing 
friends who always make me feel 
beautiful.
Funnily enough, when I was 
approached to do this article, it 
was very late and I was on my way 
to a friend’s 21st birthday. I stayed 
for the cake.

U’s ‘Latin Xpressions’ is 
admirable but mediocre

My 
mother 
thought 
she 
was in for a night of flamenco 
when she agreed to accompany 
me to “Latin Xpressions” this 
weekend at the Power Center. 
Regrettably, she was wrong.
“Latin 
Xpressions,” 
an 
annual show put on by the 
Department of Dance, featured 
multiple works choreographed 
by Spanish or Latin American 
choreographers 
as 
well 
as 
School of Music, Theatre & 

Dance 
faculty. 
Performers 
included guest artists as well as 
BFA students at the University.
Right from minute one, I 
wondered why this show had 
been called “Latin Xpressions.” 
Pieces were set to Latin music: 
I caught a lively castanet beat 
or delicate marimba in almost 
every song. Yet, the dances 
themselves were far from Latin 
styles. Almost all numbers were 
modern dance except for one, 
which may have been included 
in the lineup just to label the 
show as vaguely Latin. I wasn’t 
expecting this twist, and it was 
clear that the audience wasn’t 
either; confused chuckles and 
hesitant 
applause 
followed 

most 
pieces. 
The 
program 
and posters featured dancers 
in red tops and long flowing 
black skirts, leading me to 
believe I’d be watching a night 
of flamenco-style pieces, not 
modern dance with a few 
tinges of Latin influence. A 
friend later told me that the 
program was choreographed 
by people of Latin or Spanish 
origin, 
but 
there 
was 
no 
introduction to the program to 
offer that insight.
The first few acts were 
enjoyable at best; the last two, 
“Interlude 3” and “End With 
You,” were phenomenal. The 
show kicked off with “Prized 
Possession,” choreographed by 
Rosie Herrera, a lovable and 
quirky piece. Each dancer had 
large swaths of velcro on the 
chest of their costumes, and 
each embrace with a partner 
was followed with a slow 
burn, crackling rip as they 
pulled apart, an amusing and 
appreciated addition to the 
dance. But after the applause 
died down, I could already 
sense the unease from the 
crowd: Is this what they’d 
come to see?
The following performances 
were 
similar: 
pleasant 
but 
unsettling. 
Frequently, 
flamenco 
music 
switched 
abruptly to jazz, leaving the 
audience craving the former 
and unsure about the latter. 
“Cuca Deluxe,” a piece based 
on la cucaracha (cockroaches), 
featured dancers acting like 
insects: 
scattering 
when 
light shined on them or being 
symbolically stomped on by a 
crunching sound effect. The 
hilarity of this segment lost 
interest fast, and even more so 
when dancers were “crushed” 
but came back to life multiple 
times during the piece.
The first exception to this 
mediocrity was “Interlude 3.” 
Dancers entered the stage in 
intricately frilled lace tops and 
traditional skirts to perform a 
mixed routine with elements 
of 
samba 
and 
merengue, 
among others. Though a little 
uncoordinated at times, the 
piece moved the audience. By 
the end, everyone was clapping 
to the beat, egging on the 
dancers.
I 
dare 
say 
the 
final 
dance, 
“End 
With 
You,” 
choreographed 
by 
the 
acclaimed Ron De Jesús, a 
prior dancer with Hubbard 
Dance Street Chicago, made 
the 
whole 
program 
worth 
attending. 
Three 
rotating 

staircases of lights dropped 
down slowly from the ceiling, 
teasing the audience with a 
subtle black and white strobe 
effect. All the dancers were 
precise with their movements 
and spatially aware of everyone 
around them, creating a sense 

of harmony within lighting 
fast mounts and lifts. I had 
the magical sense that I was 
in the eye of a hurricane, like 
watching the currents and 
waves of an ocean crash around 
me while staying perfectly 
stationary.
With some more careful 
marketing, “Latin Xpressions” 
could 
become 
a 
staple, 
enjoyable 
show. 
But 
this 
weekend’s 
performances, 
while carefully executed, were 
mediocre at best.

I ate more than 
he did. We ate 
and ate and ate, 
and laughed, and 
ate until I was in 
a food coma. We 
would work it off 
later, anyways
