A demonstrator chants slogans as several thousand supporters of Egyptian Pres. M
Supreme Constitutional Court on Sunday to prevent the judges from entering.

Justices will march
to protest Pres.
Morsi's decree of
power
CAIRO (AP) - Egypt's highest
court joined a judicial rebellion
against President Mohammed
Morsi on Sunday by declaring an
open-ended strike on the day it
was supposed to rule on the legit-
imacy of two key assemblies con-
trolled by allies of the Islamist
leader.
The strike by the Supreme
Constitutional Court and opposi-
tion plans to march on the presi-
dential palace on Tuesday take
the country's latest political cri-
sis to a level not seen in the nearly
two years of turmoil since Hosni
Mubarak's ouster in a popular
uprising.
Judges from the country's
highest appeals court and its
sister lower court were already
on an indefinite strike, joining
colleagues from other tribunals
who suspended work last week to
protest what they saw as Morsi's
assault on the judiciary.
The last time Egypt had an all-
out strike by the judiciary was
in 1919, when judges joined an
uprising against British colonial
rule.

The standoff began when
Morsi issued decrees on Nov. 22
giving him near-absolute pow-
ers that granted himself and the
Islamist-dominated assembly
drafting the new constitution
immunity from the courts.
The constitutional panel then
raced in a marathon session. last
week to vote on the charter's
236 clauses without the partici-
pation of liberal and Christian
members. The fast-track hearing
pre-empted a decision from the
Supreme Constitutional Court
that was widely expected to dis-
solve the constituent assembly.
The judges -on Sunday post-
poned their ruling on that case
just before they went on strike.
Without a functioning justice
system, Egypt will be plunged
even deeper into turmoil. It has
already seen a dramatic surge in
crime after the uprising, while
state authority is being chal-
lenged in many aspects of life
and the courts are burdened by a
massive backlog of cases.
"The country cannot func-
tion for long like this, something
has to give," said Negad Borai, a
private law firm director and a
rights activist. 'We are in a coun-
try without courts of law and a
president with all the powers in
his hands. This is a clear-cut dic-
tatorial climate," he said.
Mohamed Abdel-Aziz, a rights

Mohammed Morsi surrounded the
ins strike
lawyer, said the strike by the
judges will impact everything
from divorce and theft to finan-
cial disputes that, in some cases,
could involve foreign investors.
"Ordinary citizens affected by
the strike will become curious
about the details of the current
political crisis and could possi-
bly make a choice to join the pro-
tests," he said.
The Judges Club, a union with
9,500 members, said late Sunday
that judges would not, as custom-
ary, oversee the national referen-
dum Morsi called for Dec. 15 on
the draft constitution hammered
out and hurriedly voted on last
week.
The absence of their over-
sight would raise more questions
about the validity of the vote. If
the draft is passed-in the referen-
dum, parliamentary electionsare
to follow two months later and
they too may not have judicial
supervision.
The judges say they will
remain on strike until Morsi
rescinds his decrees, which the
Egyptian leader said were tem-
porary and needed to protect the
nation's path to democratic rule.
For now, however, Morsi has
to contend with the fury of the
judiciary.
The constitutional court called
Sunday "the Egyptian judiciary's
blackest day on record."

 Michigan health officials say
the number of state residents
infected during a national out-

risen by nine to 197, with 13
deaths.
The Michigan Department
of Community Health says that

meningitis cases, 116 epidural
abscesses, one stroke and 13 joint

A bus lodged into an overpass at the Miami International Airport on Saturday. The vehicle was carrying over 30 people.

Miami International Airport

Charter crash into
overpass left many
injured
MIAMI (AP) - At Miami
International Airport, two large
signs warn drivers of large
vehicles not to pass beneath the
8-foot-6 inch concrete overpass.
Authorities say two passengers
are dead and others' have been
critically injured after a too-tall
charter bus smashed into the
overpass, crumpling metal.
One of the. signs attached to
the top of the concrete barrier
reads: "High Vehicle STOP Turn
Left." The other, placed to the
left of the driveway and several
feet in front of the barrier, says all
vehicles higher than the 8-foot-6
threshold must turn left.
Authorities said the large,
white bus carrying 32 members
of a church group hit the overpass

after the driver got lost Saturday,
killing two male passengers and
leaving three other passengers
critically injured.
Airport spokesman Greg Chin
said the bus was too tall for the
entrance to the arrivals area
and that buses are supposed to
go through the departures area
because of its higher clearance.
The bus was going about 20
mph when it struck the overpass
Saturday morning, Chin added.
News photographs showed the
front of the vehicle's rooftop
crumpled beneath the overpass.
Osvaldo Lopez, an officer
with the Miami-Dade Aviation
Department, said he heard a
loud noise Saturday morning and
rushed to help. He said he went
inside the bus and found several
passengers tossed into the cen-
ter aisle. He said the passengers,
many of whom were elderly,
remained calm.
"It was just very bloody," he

added.
Police said that one man, Sera-
fin Castillo, 86, of Miami, died at
the scene. A second man identi-
fied by authorities as Francisco
Urana, 56, also of Miami, died
later at a hospital.
Chin said passengers told him
they were partof a group of Jeho-
vah's Witnesses headed to West
Palm Beach. Police said in a news
release that the group had char-
tered the bus to take them to a
church convention there.
The group was made up of
congregation members of Sweet-
water's Kingdom Hall of Jeho-
vah's Witnesses, said Sweetwater
Mayor Manny Marono.
"This is a tragic accident that
has affected many families, as
well as, our Sweetwater family,"
Marono said in a statement.
A phone number listed for the
center in Sweetwater went unan-
swered in the hours after, the

FROM TE DAILY
Pure tourism
State should capitalize on natural resources
Michigan is well known for unique Great Lakes geography
and the abundance of outdoor activities that come with
being encircled by such a large expanse of fresh water.
This November, Gov. Rick Snyder has been reviewing a report aimed
at diversifying and expanding Michigan's "trails, outdoor adventure
sports, nature observation, eco-tourism, motorized and non-motor-
ized water sports, cultural events and festivals." The expansion of
environmental and seasonal tourism is fairly inexpensive to advocate
and will improve Michigan's economy. Our state should capitalize
on its natural resources and existing parks and trails to promote and
further reap the benefits of Michigan's tourism industry.

NOTABLE QUOTABLE
I just got to Bahrain! OMG can I live here
please? Prettiest place on earth."
- Kim Kardashian tweeted on Saturday after arriving in Bahrain to promote Millions of Milkshakes,
a chain restaurant. Protests erupted in the capital, Manama, after Kardashiant's arrival.
Not so secret

I
I

In light of the new report, Michigan's land
trails - which are necessary for transport-
ing non-motorized water vehicles - could
be expanded to become the most extensive
trails in the country. While Michigan already
boasts many miles of trails for transporting
non-motorized boats, the expansion could
make Michigan a top tourist destination for
many who spend the summer months specifi-
cally seeking these tracks and extensive parks.
Tourists who travel the country for safe and
easy canoeing and kayaking destinations would
have a special interest in Michigan. In.this way,
the proposed report outlines an underdevel-
oped market. With new tourists coming for the
boating and trails in Michigan, profits would
stay local.
Furthermore, the proposed funding for the
growth of the state parks in the report has the
possibility to revitalize big cities like Detroit.
With the creation of four to five new "signa-
ture" parks, cities around the state would have
focal points and must-see destinations, further
helping to bring in more tourism. The report
uses Chicago's Millennium Park and Provi-
dence, Rhode Island's WaterFire Park as exam-
ples for similar urban expansion and economic

opportunity to mimic in Detroit and elsewhere
in Michigan. With special tourist destinations
that offer family fun and a unique experience,
these sites could bring much needed business
traffic to Michigan's cities.
Since parks, trails and other nature obser-
vation sites are permanent fixtures in the
Michigan landscape, they present a perfect
opportunity for long-lasting economic prosper-
ity. The Pure Michigan advertising campaign
has already been successful in bringing in $605
million for the state since its inception in 2006.
With the suggested improvements, Pure Mich-
igan would have even more to advertise about
despite its budget cuts. The profit can only con-
tinue to grow as Michigan expands its parks
and recreational areas.
This proposal helps Michigan's economy
and preserves the state's natural resources and
beauty. By expanding upon parks and natural
areas, the project preserves habitats for Michi-
gan's extensive biodiversity. More specifically,
preserved land means cleaner water and a
healthier environment for Michigan's residents
and the entire Great Lakes region. The proposal
should pass to promote the environment and
under-developed market.

We've all done it.
In the middle of class,
you receive a text mes-
sage. You don't
want to be seen
reading your
phone when
you're supposed
to be listening
attentively, so
you slide it out
of your pocket DANIEL
slowly, subtly.
Keeping the CHARDELL
phone at your
hip, below the
shadows of the desk, you one-hand-
edly type your reply and send it off.
Your eyes are lowered, but you keep
your head up the whole time to give
the impression that you're listening.
Or this: as lecture winds down,
you feel the urge to check Face-
book. Most of your friends are in
class, so there's probably noth-
ing too exciting happening online
at the moment. But still, you can't
resist. Perhaps you're sitting in the
front of the auditorium, so you look
up every so often at your lecturer as
you comment on your friend's sta-
tus - that way it looks like you're
simply taking notes.
It's easy to get away with, right?
Wrong.
Before you get upset with me for
exposing these secret rituals of ours,
let me tell you something: they're
not so secret. We're not as clever as
we think. If you're giving a lecture,
or if you're leading a discussion, it's
extremely easy to distinguish the
focused student from the texting

student. One is an alert student who
engages class material. The other,
is a dead-in-the-eyes student who
inexplicably keeps his/her eyes
downturned for minutes on end.
Students who text or use Face-
book during class give themselves
away. In the poker sense of the
word, they have certain "tells."
The most obvious tell is this: a stu-
dent reads something hilarious on
Facebook, so he reflexively smiles.
Unless he happened to smile at the
exact moment that his professor
cracked a joke, the student's out-of-
the-blue smile is a telltale giveaway
of the,"I'm obviously on Facebook"
syndrome. This can be especially
awkward if the subject of the lec-
ture is far from funny.
I'm not telling you this so that
you can devise new, better, more
self-aware strategies to get away
with texting or using Facebook in
class. Instead, I'm telling you this
because it's a losing habit for every-
one: you don't learn, you distract
your classmates, you look irrespon-
sible in the eyes of your instructors,
and you insult their teaching. That
is the brutal truth.
The best learning environments
that I've experienced are ones that
are distraction-free and where
everyone is not only encouraged,
but excited to participate. In this
regard, of course, much relies on
the quality of instruction: students
will have less motivation to seek out
distractions if they find themselves
absorbed in the course material.
I'm but a lowly undergraduate, yet
I humbly remind any professors or

graduate student instructors that
it's your responsibility to teach us
with passion and to expectthe most
of us.
The classroom
is affected by
our addiction to
technology.
But this doesn't mean that stu-
dents are off the hook, either.
After all, whether you text your
friends or check your Facebook is
ultimately your choice to make. So
consider this a friendly message
from a concerned peer.
I know it's tempting to abuse the
many electronic distractions at our
fingertips. Like I said, we've all done
it. But, as one of my professors once
put it, our inclination to habitually
- even involuntarily - check our
phones or Facebook pages is fright-
eningly evocative of addiction.
Addiction is defined as insur-
mountable dependence on a cer-
tain substance or activity. If you
want to prove that you're not an
addict to these social technologies,
refrain from using them when you
know you shouldn't be: ina univer-
sity classroom.

BAYAN FOUNAS I VIEWPOINT
Unfounded claims

4

A recent viewpoint in The Michigan Daily
("Israel acted in defense," 11/18/12) claimed
that Hamas initiated the recent violence
between the Gaza and Israel "without jus-
tifiable provocation." This claim, however,
is misleading and feeds University students
false information. According to Reuters on
Nov. 8, Israeli military forces crossed the
border into the Gaza Strip in an apparent
incursion, prompting retaliatory fire - at the
Israeli force, not into Israel - from the Popu-
lar Resistance Committees, a militant group
in Gaza. The Israel Defense Forces returned
fire, killing a 12-year-old Palestinian boy in
the process. This incident ended a two-week
standstill in violence between the two parties.
On Nov. 14, Israel launched "Operation Pil-
lar of Defense," which resulted in the death of
170 Palestinians and the injury of 1,220 more,
most of whom were civilians. The people of
Gaza faced relentless bombardment from
the air and sea, with any semblance of calm
quickly interrupted by the buzz of a drone or
roar of an F16.
The viewpoint also states that Israel
withdrew from Gaza in 2005 with "hope
for peace," but IDF only repositioned their
forces on the periphery of Gaza. The block-
ade imposed on Gaza has been equally - if
not more - abusive and oppressive on Gazans
than the pre-2005 Israeli occupation there.
The Gaza Strip is one of the world's most
densely populated regions, with its 1.6 mil-
lion residents living in what has been deemed
the world's largest open-air prison.
Amnesty International reports that more
than 70 percent of Gazans depend on humani-
tarian aid for survival. They also report that
"Israeli authorities hindered or prevented hun-
dreds of patients from leaving Gaza to obtain
medical treatment," as well as workers and
students from pursuing their jobs and educa-
tion, respectively: And, as we now know from
a recent Ha'aretz report, food consumption
in Gaza has been restricted - by calculating a
minimum number of calories per person - so
as to keep Gazans on the brink of starvation.
The policy can be summed up by the following
quote from Dov Weisglass, an adviser to former
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert: "The idea
is to put the Palestinians on a diet, but not to

make them die of hunger." Thus, the collective
punishment of the Palestinian people, in this
case via starvation, has been a part of Israel's
"defense" strategy, in clear violation of interna-
tional laws and covenants on human rights.
The viewpoint mentions the dropping of
warning leaflets in the Gaza Strip during
Operation Cast Lead in Dec. 2008, a three-
week Israeli offensive. But given the inescap-
ability of the besieged Gaza Strip, these leaflets
functioned more as death sentences than well-
intentioned warnings. The three-week assault
resulted in more than 1,400 Palestinians
killed and more than 5,300 wounded, as well
as more than 10 Israelis killed and more than
500 wounded. Of the 1,400 Palestinians killed,
more than 900 were civilians. The killing of
almost 1,000 civilians is not collateral damage
as the authors state - it is a massacre.
Israel's recent onslaught on Gaza's civil-
ian neighborhoods is part of a pattern that
reemerged again a few weeks ago during
Operation Pillar of Defense, the death toll
consisting mostly of Palestinian civilians.
This operation included a strike that killed
three generations of the same family, which
resulted in nine total fatalities, including four
children agedbetween land 7. The Dalou fam-
ily has no affiliation with any militant group,
yet Israel has yet to issue anything resembling
an apologyto any of the victims.
Moreover, a ceasefire was mediated last
Wednesday by Egypt to halt this recent escala-
tion, which Israel has repeatedly broken over
the week by shooting civilians near the border
fence for protesting. About 19 people have been
wounded and 20 year old Anwar Qudaih was
shot dead.
Israel cannot claim self-defense as long as
it occupies, annexes and destroys Palestinian
land, while collectively punishing an entire
population for resisting that occupation. This
punishment includes restrictions on movement
and essential goods, kidnapping and torture,
the destructionofhomes and theft ofresources.
As long as Israel's brutal occupation continues,
so too will the resistance from Palestinians,
until their genuine cries for freedom are heard
and recognized.

Sandra Harding and I wouldn't
get along. ,I suppose I've known
this for a while now, having fol-
lowed the professor's work on the
philosophy of science for a few
years without finding anything to
agree with her about. Still, I saw
her lecture last Tuesday, in which
she asked whether "real sciences"
had tobe secular, as something that
could bridge the separate worlds of
religion and science. "Of course sci-
entific methods must be secular," I
thought to myself. "Surely she will
agree." But I suppose you already
know how this story ends: Sandra
Harding and I didn't get along.
She began by claiming that
there's a certain unwarranted resis-
tance to. "indigenous knowledge
systems" - systems of knowledge
derived by local communities gen-
erally as part of a cosmology and
expressed through laws, oral tradi-
tions and rituals - by proponents of
"Western science." By discounting
these apparatuses of knowledge,
Western science does itself a dis-
service by disqualifying modes of
thinking and ways of understanding
to both itself as a methodology and
to the universe as a whole. Further-
more, Harding claims that these
indigenous knowledge systems have
allowed people to thrive and sur-
vive and accomplish great feats in
their lives and therefore should be
permitted entry into realms of sci-
ence as valid forms of reasoning. In
fact, she claims thatto do otherwise
is intolerant and prejudicial.
One of the main reasons Harding
gives for the existence of such oppo-
sition by "the West" - a term that's
more an abstract idea than a real
"thing" - is that the West has built
itself up for millennia by declaring
certain dichotomies between itself
and the "other" civilization. Such
binaries include freedom vs. bond-

age, progress vs. retreat, universal-
ity vs. particularity and reason vs.
dogma. Harding claims that what
underlies each of these choices is the
fundamental opposition of secular-
ism and religion, legitimized by the.
West's massive scientific enterprise.
If the sciences were to allow reli-
giously derived indigenous knowl-
edge systems into their ranks, the
West would be unable to justify their
exclusion anywhere else in its'infra-
structure. Hence, all of the progress
the West has made would be undone.'
Thus the reticence.
Or at least so far as Harding would
have us believe.
The actual reason is less romantic,
less conspiratorial than all of that.
These indigenous knowledge sys-
tems are usually just plain wrong. It's
actually quite a simple point Harding
herself not only neglected to address
in her lecture but also failed to
answer adequately when questioned
by the audience. When asked, "If
there aren't fairies in the garden, why
should scientists care that some cul-
ture believes and acts like there is?"
She retorted that we should accept
their worldview because "it works."
She then lamented the grammar of
the question, saying that it comes
from a Protestant Christian type
of secularism embedded in notions
such as "beliefs" which have no bear-
ing on other cultures, going so far
as to say that indigenous knowledge
systems "are not interested in the
truth or falsity of their beliefs."
But that fallacy obviates any pos-
sible scientific discussion. Scientific
methods are about establishing the
truth or falsity of claims about the
universe using evidence and logic
to attain these ends. If a knowledge
system has no concern for whether
or not what it says is true, I suppose
that's allwell and good, but it doesn't
qualify as science. It cannot. It is for

this reason that religious knowledge
was excluded from scientific meth-
ods so very long ago, as it is neither
held up by evidence nor held down
by the lack of it. The truth or fal-
sity of a religious or spiritual tenet
is generally not near the top of the
"List of Things Religious or Spiri-
tual People Care About." Usually,
these belief systems are focused on
ritual, community and understand-
ing oneself and one's place in the
cosmos, and whether any of these
religious beliefs are true or false is
beside the point to a believer.
To a scientist, however, the truth
of a claim is all that matters. The
way the world is matters. Using the
best tools we'can - evidence, reason,
logic, deduction and experimenta-
tion - we're able to paint finer and
finer pictures of our cosmos. Our
cosmic picture's colors get more
accurate, the positions of all the facts
more precise, the canvas expanded
nearer to its proper proportions. That
someone else may draw a pretty pic-
ture of the same universe is nice and
wonderful and spectacular and can
be deeply moving to both themselves
and others - it can be many things,
but "science" isn't one of them.
This isn't to say that we can't
learn from others' new techniques
or ways to visualize our existence,
but rather to declare that science
can only be concerned with giv-
ing us the most correct picture it
can, not the prettiest, not the most
meaningful. The world we live in is
the way it is, and it's the job of sci-
entists to find that out as best they
can. If there aren't actually any fair-
ies in the garden, then there are no
grounds to include them in science's
cosmic canvas, no matter how much
we may wish they were real.

More women serve in
the U.S. Marine Corps.

Five rewarded at annual
Kennedy Center Honors

Efforts seek to
add more females,
diversity to
organization
SAN DIEGO (AP) - Marine
1st Lt. Brandy Soublet is about as
far from the war front as possible
at her desk in the California des-
ert, but she's on the front lines of
an experiment that could one day
put women as close to combat as
their male peers.
The Penfield, N.Y. woman
is one of 45 female Marines
assigned this summer to 19 all-
male combat battalions. The
Defense Department in the past
year has opened thousands of
combat positions to women to
slowly integrate them and gauge
the impact such a social change
would have on the military's abil-
ity to fight wars.
No branch is likely to feel that
change more than the Marine
Corps.
* The small, tight-knit force is
the most male of the armed ser-
vices and prides itself on having
the toughest and most aggressive
warriors. The Corps historically

has higher casualty rates because
it is considered to be the "tip of
the spear," or the first to respond
to conflicts. It also was among the
last military branches to open its
doorsto women, formingthe first
female Corps in 1943, accord-
ing to the Women's Memorial in
Washington D.C.
But changing times are chal-
lenging the traditions of the
force, long likened to a brother-
hood.
Modern warfare has put
women in combat like never
before over the past decade, even
though a 1994 policy bars them
from being assigned to ground
combat units below the brigade
level, which were considered too
dangerous since they are often
smaller and closer to combat for
longer periods.
Already under pressure to
provide the same opportunities
for women, the Defense Depart-
ment was hit Tuesday with a
second lawsuit by female ser-
vice members - including two
Marines - charging that the
gender barriers unfairly block
them from promotions open to
men in combat.
The lawsuits are intended to
accelerate the military's slow

march toward lifting the ban
that plaintiffs allege has barred
women from 238,000 positions.
Defense officials say they
recently opened 14,500 jobs to
women, and they need to move
cautiously to ensure the change
will not disrupt wartime opera-
tions. Soublet and the other 44
women are part of the quiet,
slow transformation. Women
make up about 7 percent of the
Marine Corps compared to
about 14 percent overall among
the military's 1.4 million active
military personnel.
She said some Marines ini-
tially eyed her pioneering pres-
ence in the all-male battalion
with skepticism.
"The way that I would
describe it to friends and family
was it was kind of like I showed
up to work in a costume," the
25-year-old logistics officer
said in a phone interview from
Twenty-Nine Palms, a remote
desert base east of San Diego.
"They stared a little bit but after
a while it wasn't like, that any-
more."
That experience may play out
on bases and boats worldwide as
the Pentagon levels the battle-
field.

Hoffman,
Letterman, Led
Zeppelin receive
awards
WASHINGTON (AP) - David
Letterman's "stupid human
tricks" and Top 10 lists vaulted
into the ranks of cultural acclaim
Sunday night as the late-night
comedian received this year's
Kennedy Center Honors with
rock band Led Zeppelin, an
actor, a ballerinaand a bluesman.
Stars from New York, Holly-
wood and the musicworld joined
President Barack Obama at the
White House on Sunday night
to salute the honorees, whose
ranks also include actor Dustin
Hoffman, Chicago bluesman
Buddy Guy and ballerina Natalia
Makarova.
The honors are the nation's
highest award Tor those who
influenced American culture
through the arts. The recipients
were later saluted by fellow per-
formers at the Kennedy Center
Opera House in a show to be
broadcast Dec. 26 on CBS.
Obama drew laughs from his
guests when he described the
honorees as "some extraordi-
nary people who have no busi-
ness being on the same stage
together."
Noting that Guy made his
first guitar strings using the
wire from a window screen, he
quipped, "That worked until his
parents started wondering how
all the mosquitoes were getting
in."
The president thanked the
members of Led Zeppelin for

behaving themselves at the
White House given their history
of"hotel rooms trashed and may-
hem all around."
Obama noted Letterman's
humble beginnings as an India-
napolis weatherman who once
reported the city was being
pelted by hail 'the size of canned
hams."'
"It's one of the highlights of
his career," he said.
All kidding aside, Obama
described all of the honorees
as artists who "inspired us to
see things in a new way, to hear
things differently, to discover
something within us or to appre-
ciate how much beauty there is in
the world."
"It's that unique power that
makes the arts so important," he
added.
Later on the red carpet, Letter-
man said he was thrilled by the
recognition and to visit Obama at
the White House.
"It supersedes everything,
honestly," he said. "I haven't won
that many awards."
During the show, comedian
Tina Fey said she grew up watch-
ing her mom laugh at Letterman
as he brought on "an endless
parade of weirdos."
"Who was this Dave Letter-
man guy?" Fey said. "Was he a
brilliant, subtle passive-aggres-
sive parody of a talk show host?
Or just some Midwestern goon
who was a little bit off? Time has
proven that there's just really no
way of knowing."
Alec Baldwin offered a Top 10
reasons Letterman was winning
the award, including the fact that
he didn't leave late night for a six-
month stint in primetime --a not-
so-subtle digatrival Jay Leno.

Jimmy Kimmel, who will soon
compete head-to-head with Let-
terman on ABC, said he fell in
love with Letterman early in life
and even had a "Late Night" cake
on his 16th birthday.
"To me it wasn't just a TV
show," Kimmel said. "It was the
reason I would fail to make love
to a live woman for many, many
years."
For Buddy Guy, singers Bonnie
Raitt, Tracy Chapman and others
got most of the crowd on its feet
singing Guy's signature "Sweet
Home Chicago."
Morgan Freeman hailed Guy
as a pioneer who helped bridge
soul and rock and roll.
"When you hear the blues, you
really don't think of it as black or
white or yellow or purple or blue,"
Freeman said. "Buddy Guy, your
blue brought us together."
Robert De Niro saluted Hoff-
man, saying he had changed act-
ing, never took any shortcuts and
was brave enough to be a perfec-
tionist.
"Before Dustin burst on the
scene, it was pretty much OK for
movie stars to show up, read their

By the end ofthe night, the Foo

PROPOSAL 2
From Page 1A
Reviewing the case en bane, the
6th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled
in an 8-7 decision on Nov. 15 that
Proposal 2, the state-wide ban on
racial preferences that was passed
by popular vote in 2006, was
unconstitutional.
Judge R. Guy Cole Jr. wrote in
the majority opinion that Proposal
2 violates the Equal Protection
Clause by placing an undue.bur-
den on those seeking affirmative
action.

difficult.
"The only way to make this
work is it has got to be region-
al," Casperson said. "There's
got to be buy-in from the whole
region, not just Wayne County or
Detroit. That's been kind of the
struggle all the way through this
thing."
While the proposal has
received its fair share of opposi-
tion, Casperson said it is not pri-
marily based around party lines
and there has been bi-partisan
support.
Much of the opposition has
emerged in Washtenaw County,
where local political leaders
have said they want to opt out
of the plan. Dan Smith, a mem-
ber of the Washtenaw Board of
Commissioners, said he views
Washtenaw County as a second-
ary focus.
"The concept is interesting,
but I think there's a lot bigger
problems that Wayne and Oak-
land County need to iron out
before Washtenaw County gets
involved," Smith said.
State Rep. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann
Arbor) said because the Ann

From Page 1A
the project was aimed at keeping
manufacturing current with the
newest technology available.
"Based on the tremendous
advances that have been made
in the past few years, there are
very good reasons to believe that
advanced battery technologies
can and will play an increasingly
valuable role in strengthening
America's energy and economic
security," Chu said.
University professors and
state leaders likewise hailed
the project, which includes
nearly 40 other labs, universi-
ties and businesses nationwide,
as a key achievement for the
state to maintain its status as
a leader in the manufacturing
industry.
Mark Barteau, the director of

sity philosophy Prof. Carl Cohen,
who authored Prop. 2, said they
expected the Supreme Court to
take up the case.
Cohen estimated the odds to
be "97 percent, I'd say, maybe
98."
If the Supreme Court opts to
rule on the case, the Court might
need "a still picture" of affir-
mative action and the effects of
absence on universities to rule
effectively, according to Law
Prof. Mark Rosenbaum, who
argued the case in favor of affir-
mative action.
While Rosenbaum called the
order to stay the ruling a disser-
vice to the state, he said it was a
practical necessity given that the
ruling came down in the middle

of an admissions cycle.
"Everything would be topsy-
turvy," he said. "It would be
changing the rules in the middle
of the process, and that would
lead to mass confusion and
claims of unfairness."
The Supreme Court could
wait until October of next year
to decide whether to review the
ruling, Rosenbaum said. If that
is the case, the Court might not
issue an opinion until the spring
of 2014, meaning this admissions
cycle and the next could proceed
without the University being able
to use affirmative action in its
admissions decisions.

SUSTAINABILITY

ly as committed to pursuing sus-
tainability on campus," Pfeiffer
said.
Thirty-five studentleaders met
in September to discuss the agen-
da, and six student organizations
have pledgedto help work toward
the agenda's goals - including the
Greek Life Sustainability Team,
Compost Michigan and the Envi-
ronmental Issues Commission of
the Central Student Government
- according to Pfeiffer.
Pfeiffer said she is in contact
with more than 50 student orga-
nizations, and those groups were
set to finalize their pledge on Fri-
day.
Andrew Horning, the direc-
tor of the Graham Sustainability
Institute, said the institute serves
as a channel for students to pro-
pose ideas to the administration
and develop more student and
faculty input in decision-making.
"It seems like virtually every
new creative sustainability ini-
tiative on campus starts with a
push fromthe students," Horning
said. "'I think the fact that stu-
dents continue to do that effec-
tively and orderly as possible is
exactly what we want. The more
thoughtful the students are, the
better the chance they have at
succeeding."
Horning said the combined
efforts of the student organiza-
tions will make sustainability on
campus more achievable.
"All the student groups are
only going to be as successful as
they are able to work together,"
Horning said. "Trying to weave a

fabric through all of these groups
will bring success."
Horning added that he hopes
student and faculty cooperation
will complete 4the University's
sustainability goals by 2025.
Leah Zimmerman, a Rackham
student in the Herb Institute for
Global Sustainable Enterprise
andastudentsustainabilityboard
member, said the board will prob-
ably be unable to complete each of
the goals within the school year
because they were designed for
long-term implementation.
"We did want to set some
reach goals, and some big pic-
ture goals that we really want to
work towards as students," Zim-
merman said. "We also included
some language in the agenda that
would suggest where we wantthe
University to go. Obviously that is
limited because the focus is on
student efforts, but we included
stretch goals for student groups."
Pfeiffer said the SSI is looking
at each individual goal and apply-
ing them to the student body
accordingly.
For waste prevention, the SSI
is working with Music Matters,
MRelay andTEDx University of
Michigan to make their events
waste-free next semester.
"They're all large events that
are happening and affect a huge
amount of students in the student
population," Pfeiffer said.
She added that working with
these student organizations
would provide the opportunity
for feedback for nextyear's agen-
da.
"We can look back and see why
we weren't able to make all of
these events waste-free," Pfeiffer
said. "We would be able to work

with the administration to make
it easier for students to compost
and give them the infrastructure
to do so."
LSA junior Kevin Kononenko,
the adviser to the Greek Life Sus-
tainability Team, said he attend-
ed the meeting in September and
immediately joined the initiative.
"I felt like their goals were
right in line with our goals,
especially in waste prevention,"
Kononenko said. "We defined
what goals were realistic and
what way we could work with the
administration."
Kononenko said GLIST cre-
ated a recycling campaign called
Trust for Cups that launched in
October, in which eight fraterni-
ties signed to increase the recy-
cling rates of their houses. The
houses aim to have 35 percent of
their waste be recyclable.
Each fraternity' house has a
recycling operation consultant
that educates the sustainabil-
ity chair of the house on the pro-
cess of recycling, according to
Kononenko.
"The biggest thing that we
shoot for is to have leadership in
the fraternity houses," Kononen-
ko said. "The leaders will then
take the stuff they have learned
and bring it to the entire frater-
nity."
Pfeiffer said the work in waste
prevention gives everystudent an
opportunity to get involved with
sustainability.
"Ithink it's ahuge opportunity
for students from all over cam-
pus, who aren't just involved with
sustainability, to actually care
about the environment," Pfeiffer
said. "It's like the saying, 'We all
live on Planet Blue."'


the Michigan Energy Institute
and a professor of advanced
energy research, said the proj-
ect will be important in forging
advances in energy technology.
"This hub is aimed at break-
throughs in battery technology
for energy storage, because step-
out advances are needed to reach
the energy densities desired for
both automotive and grid storage
applications," Barteau said.
According to Barteau's state-
ment, University research-
ers will look into building new
materials for the project.
U.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow
(D-Mich.) said in a statement
that the project presents a good
opportunity to grow jobs in the
state.
"When we make things here
and grow things here, we create
jobs here in Michigan," Stabe-
now said. "Michigan is leading
the country in clean energy

innovation and advanced bat-
tery technologies, creating jobs
and reducing our dependence
on foreign oil. These new hubs
will bring together Michigan's
innovative businesses and uni-
versities from across the state
to create more breakthroughs in
advanced battery technologies
right here in Michigan."
U.S. Rep. John Dingell
(D-Mich.) also indicated the
project has potential benefits for
the state in a statement on Fri-
day, adding that it is a good fit for
the University.
"As demand for electric vehi-
cles continues to rise, we need to
invest new technologies that can
be developed here in Southeast
Michigan," Dingell said. "We
must keep fighting to regain our
leadership position in the clean
energy race and this announce-
ment is a strong step in that
direction."

After a 150-person game of
rock, paper, scissors, the student
entrepreneurs btoke into small-
er groups to attend workshops.
University alum Erik Torenberg
- an MPowered alum, former

of Rapt.fm, a Chat Roulette-style
rapping website - instructed

a workshop entitled "Sell-

learned about networking and
freestyle rapping.
Other workshops included
"Bootstrapping and Fundrais-
ing," where students learned
about effective fundraising
techniques from Jake Cohen,
the vice president at Detroit
Venture Partners. Another
was "Getting Started in the D,"
where the aspiring entrepre-
neurs discussed potential busi-
ness opportunities available in
Detroit with Maria LaLonde,
the recruiting and development
leader at Bizdom, a tech-based
entrepreneurship accelerator.
LSA junior Sarah Oleinick,
co-director of the summit, said
MPowered's goal is to spread
the entrepreneurial spirit across
campus as much as possible.
"Today we're hoping that they

will learn a little bit in the work-
shops, that they'll meet as many
people as possible, pitch their
ideas and just really get inspired
to take that next step," Oleinick
said of the semi-finalists.
LSA junior Rachel Hamp-
ton's environment-related pitch
earned her a spot in the semi-
finals. She said she came to the
summit to hear stories and learn
from successful entrepreneurs.
"I was really excited to see
what MPowered had to offer,"
Hampton said. "U of M has so
many opportunities, it's like why
not take advantage of them?"
Engineering " sophomore
Joshua Rosefelt said he attended
to learn about earning grants to

"We're really here just to fig-
ure out more of what we can do

Highway tunnel ceiling
slabs fall in Japan, kill 9

Unstable roof
delays search and
rescue effort
TOKYO (AP) - Concrete ceil-
ing slabs fell onto moving vehi-
cles deep inside a long Japanese
highway tunnel, and authorities
confirmed nine deaths before
suspending rescue work Monday
while the roof was being rein-
forced to prevent more collapses.
Two vehicles caught fire
in the accident Sunday morn-
ing, and heavy smoke initially
hindered rescue efforts. The
location of the accident about
1.7 kilometers (a mile) inside
the 4.7-kilometer (3-mile) long
Sasago Tunnel was also making

the work difficult.
The nine dead were traveling
in three vehicles in the tunnel
about 80 kilometers (50 miles)
west of Tokyo on a highway that
links the capital to central Japan.
The tunnel opened in 1977 and is
one of many in the mountainous
country.
The search was suspended
Mondaymorningwhile the high-
way operator does work to sup-
port the remaining slabs in the
ceiling, said Jun Goto, an official
at the Fire and Disaster Manage-
ment Agency. It's expected to
resume by afternoon.
Goto said it's not clear if there
are other survivors.
Police and the highway opera-
tor Central Japan Expressway
Co. were investigating why the

concrete slabs collapsed. An
inspection of the tunnel's roof in
September found nothing amiss,
according to Satoshi Noguchi, a
company official.
An estimated 270 concrete
slabs, each weighing 1.4 metric
tons (1.54 short tons), suspended
from the arched roof of the tun-
nel fell over a stretch of about
110 meters (120 yards), Noguchi
said.
The operator was exploring
the possibility that bolts hold-
ing a metal piece suspending
the panels above the road had
become aged, he said. The pan-
els, measuring about 5 meters (16
feet) by 1.2 meters (4 feet), and
8 centimeters (3 inches) thick,
were installed when the tunnel
was constructed in 1977.

Third storm in less than a
week drenches North Calif.

Powerful rain
and winds, but
structural damage
less than expected
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -
Residents of Northern Cali-
fornia endured the brunt of
another powerful storm that
drenched the area with yet
another round of pounding rain
and strong winds, but damage
from the storm was less than
expected, officials said.
The latest storm system -
the third to hit the area in less
than a week - moved across the
region late Saturday and early
Sunday dropping as much as an
inch of rain per hour in some
areas, toppling trees and knock-

ing out electrical service to tens
of thousands of people, officials
said.
Rivers across Northern Cali-
fornia swelled from the deluge,
but did not flood as extensively
as had been expected, officials
said,
Forecasters had issued flood
warnings for the Napa and Rus-
sian rivers, two rivers north of
San Francisco with a history of
flooding, as well as the Truckee
River, near Lake Tahoe, but by
Sunday afternoon had canceled
the warning for the Russian
River.
"It (the storm) moved
through a lit bit faster than it
was looking like it would, so
it didn't plant on top of us and
keeping raining," said Austin
Cross, a meteorologist with the
National Weathir Service. "The

period of heavy rain didn't last
as long."
In Napa, where officials had
handed out more than 8,000
sandbags and about 150 tons of
sand before the storm hit, offi-
cials breathed a sigh of relief Sun-
day afternoon after the heaviest
rain moved out of the area and
the city appeared to avoid any
major damage from the storm.
"We've had some minor
street flooding and some of the
intersections were flooded,"
Napa city spokesman Barry
Martin said.
Flood construction projects
were credited with keeping the
river within its banks through
the city, while most of anticipat-
ed flooding, expected around 6
p.m. Sunday, was expected to
hit a mostly agricultural area
outside of the city, officials said.

Island nation claims
treaty is outdated,
insufficient
DOHA, Qatar (AP) - High-
lighting a rift between the rich
countries and emerging econo-
mies like China, New Zealand's
climate minister staunchly
defended his government's deci-
sion to drop out of the emis-
sions pact for developed nations,
saying it's an outdated and
insufficient response to global
warming.
Other key issues at the con-
ference, now starting its sec-
ond week, include how to help
emerging nations switch to
climate-friendly energy sources
and charting the course for a
new treaty that would replace
the Kyoto Protocol, which covers
only developed countries.
New Zealand announced
before the U.N.'s climate talks
started here last week that it
would not take part in the sec-
ond phase of the Kyoto treaty.

That angered climate activists
and stunned small neighboring
island nations, who fear they
could be submerged by rising sea
levels spurred by global warm-
ing.
Climate Minister Tim Groser
told The Associated Press on
Sunday that New Zealand is
"ahead of the curve" by shifting
its attention from the 1997 Kyoto
deal to a new global climate pact
that would also include develop-
ing nations.
The U.S. never ratified Kyoto,
which expires this year, partly
because it did not impose limits
on China and other emerging
economies.
Australia and European coun-
tries want to extend the pact at
the current conference in Doha
until a wider treaty comes into
force. That is not scheduled to
happen until 2020.
Groser didn't see a point in
that, because those countries
together represent less than 15
percent of global emissions.
"You cannot seriously argue
you are dealing with climate

Osama Faisal/AP
change at the U.N. climate talks in
Out Of
ate Talks
change unless you start to tackle
the 85 percent of emissions that
are outside (Kyoto)," Groser said.
"We're lookingbeyond Kyoto now
to where we think the real game
A majority of emissions of
heat-trapping gases that most
climate scientists blame for ris-
ingglobal temperatures currently
come from developing countries,
and China is now the world's top
emitter. Beijing argues it must be
allowed to increase its emissions
as it economy expands, lifting
millions of people out of poverty.
It also insists that Western
nations bear a historical respon-
sibility for climate change, since
their fossil fuel factories spewed
emissions into the atmosphere
long before China started indus-
trializing.
China therefore wants to retain
the sharp division between rich
and poor countries that has guid-
ed the slow-moving climate talks
since they started two decades
ago. Rich countries want to get rid
of that distinction, which they say
doesn't reflect the world today.

How Claire Danes,
became unstoppable

FILM REVIEW
resh-paced thrills

For two years, Claire
Danes has been invin-
cible. Since 2010, she
has been nominated for nine
significant awards (two Emmys,
two Satellites,_
two Golden
Globes,
one SAG,
one Critics'
Choice and
one Televi-
sion Critics
Association) KAYLA
for her roles UPADHYAYA
in the HBO
biopic "Tem-
ple Grandin" and Showtime's
thriller "Homeland."
She won all nine.
I first discovered Danes in
seventh grade. I was at a friend's
house watching TeenNick - my
family only had basic cable at
the time, so this was a big deal -
when "My So-Called Life" came
on. As unpolished and bluff as a
middle schooler's diary, "Life"
was unlike any of the moralizing
teen shows I watched at the time
("Boy Meets World" and "7th
Heaven" beingsome of the worst
offenders of twisting adolescence
into'romanticized parables).
I caught episodes sporadically,
unable to watch the series from
start to finish until Netflix came
around, but even in fragmented
pieces, I fell for Danes's Angela
Chase, who thought being a
woman meant dyeing her hair
without her mother's permis-
sion, wearing dark red lipstick
and dating boys who drink their
coffee black. I treasured Angela's
striking, star-crossed friend-
ship with Rayanne, like Angela
clutching Tarot cards close to
her heart.
Much of MSCL's charm came
from its emotionally honest writ-
ing and characters, but Danes
was its beating heart, her natural
delivery - full of "ums," "likes"
and uneven pauses - injecting
Angela with truth.
We've quite literally watched
Danes grow up on our TV
screens. She was only 15 years
old when she won her first Gold-
en Globe for Best Lead Actress in
a Drama in 1995, and she beat out
contenders with well more than
double her experience. In her
acceptance speech, she was as
plain-spoken as Angela, but for-
got to thank her parents. Which
is why, 17 years later, she was
sure to thank them right away
when she accepted the same
exact award for her performance
as the charged and discerning
Carrie Mathison in "Homeland."
I told you - Claire Danes knows
how to win awards.
Nowadays, every TV critic
worth his or her salt is head-
over-heels for her, but this wasn't
always the case. For a brief
period in the late '90s, Danes
was incredibly unpopular among
critics and TV lovers, but it had
nothing to do with her talent.
When it became apparentthat
"My So-Called Life" was facing
cancellation, news soon followed
that Danes had approached the

Slasher porn 'The

unflinchingly At Quality16
reject "The and Rave
Collection" as
a bloodbath- LD
ing, talentless,
sadistic exhibit. That'd be too
easy, because he or she would be
100 percent correct.
But films of this "Like, are you
serious?" nature actually accom-
plish a fundamental task of going
to the movies: They manifest
entertainment value.
In "The Collection," sicko-
genius director Marcus Dun-
stan ("Saw 3D") doesn't deviate
from his usual fucked-up genre:
blood, tits and bloody tits. His
Rotten Tomatoes profile is
devoid of a picture and a bio, and
his filmography holds a consis-
tently "rotten" appraisal. Still,
he doubtlessly succeeds here in
unconventional ways with sat-
ire, Shooter McGavin with boy-
ish, blonde locks and high-octane
lensing that beautifully depicts
the gross-out fest.
Elena (played amateurishly by
rookie Emma Fitzpatrick) and
two friends head to an under-
ground nightclub -youknow,the
one guarded by a Mortal Kombat
character and located down 39
different alleyways. Dancing,
drugs and drinking ensue. Irrel-
evant to everything, Elena finds
her boyfriend, supposedly work-
ing overtime, sucking face with a

"I'LL NEVER GIVE YOU BACK THAT CHARIZARD CARD!"

random chick. Classic.
The focus then shifts to a bug-
eyed, leather-masked subhu-
man who presses a button that
mechanically locks all doors in
the club. Then a spinning spiked
wheel descends across the entire
dance floor. Splat. Elena sur-
vives, but is taken by The Collec-
tor, causing her wealthy father
(played with comical sincerity by
Christopher McDonald, "Happy
Gilmore") to assemble a merce-
nary team to retrieve her in an
abandoned hotel. Let the good
times roll.
A fair question to ask is: What
distinguishes this rubbish from
the "Saw" or "Hostel" series? In
many ways, all three are simi-
lar: the sadism, the superflu-
ous expletive counts, the failed
attempts at plot consolidation.
But "The Collection" delivers a
special component that brings it
freshness: the tempo. Once the
labyrinth odyssey begins, the
rest of the film balances painfully
slow, whispering moments with
the skull-crushing speeds of kill-
ing sequences. It works.
Too many people forget to
laugh at films like this. It's sup-
posed to happen. The writers
know it, the genre fans definitely
know it, but generally viewers
take splatter moyies too seriously.
This leads to an immediate dis-
counting of the film and "What
were the writers smoking?"

arguments. "The Collection"
is teeming with truly impres-
sive creativity. The abandoned
hotel, for instance, is rigged with
human-size mousetraps that all
serve the same purpose: drain
the victim of all blood. But it's not
the blood fountains that make or
break this film - blood is a given.
Let it make you cringe, scream,
barf and stuff your face into your
date's cleavage. But don't allow it
to make you disbelieve too much.
Remember: The creators are even
more aware of their film's objec-
tive, ridiculousness and lack of
believability. Movies, at their core,
transport oneself to an alterna-
tive world where different people,
events and meanings exist. Films
too often aren't self-aware. "The
Collection" knows exactly what
it is, how many statues it plans to
reel in and the eternal following
these movies retain.
When juggling between decid-
ing to see "The Collection," one
shouldn't juxtapose blood-ver-
sus-drama or gross-versus-clean.
Instead, think farce-versus-
comedy or satire-versus-blatant
LOL. It's a funhouse everyone
has nightmares about. In the
end, it's simply an inexplicably
Animorph-eyed dude wearing

"We are excited to represent

Michigan coach Brady Hoke said
through the football team's offi-

The selection to the Outback

of a letdown for the Wolverines.
It appeared that they would be

But the Cornhuskers' blowout

to the Capital One Bowl instead

then relegated Michigan to the

the Wolverines (3-6-1 CCHA,

able to pull out a shootout vic-

weekend with two points.

stretch, several waving plungers
followed. The junior stretched

It was in this pit, in Michigan's

Four of them have played this
season, with varying degrees of
frequency. Forward Glenn Rob-

forward A.J. Treais. "If they
score a goal, we got to get right
back at them and refocus:I

allowed the first goal of the
game this season they have
posted just a 2-6 record. The

Changing of the guards gives
quick-dividends for Michigan

By NEAL ROTHSCHILD
Daily Sports Editor
PEORIA, Ill. - Thirty-six
minutes from Nik Stauskas and
the first playing time of Caris
LeVert's career sent the mes-
sage loud and clear.
There's a new order at guard
for the Michigan basketball
team.
.Stauskas, the freshman, led
the team with 22 points on four
of five 3-point shooting, propel-
ling the 3rd-ranked Wolverines
to their 74-66 win over Bradley
on Saturday at Carver Arena.
But one man's minutes on the
court are another's off the
court, and senior gualds Matt
Vogrich and Eso Akunne rode
the bench for longer than either
had the whole season.
After spending the first six
games coming off the bench,
Stauskas got his first start,
and it came at the expense of
Vogrich, who played only the
final four minutes of Saturday's
game. Akunne, after playing in
each game this season, sat the
entire time.
And though Stauskas , has
impressed with his offense
- he's now averaging over 14
points and has led the Wolver-
ines in scoring over the last five
games - it was his defense that
prompted Michigan coach John
Beilein to put him in the start-
inglineup.
"He's doing too many other
good things," Beilein said. "If he
hadn't played such good defense
the other night against (North
Carolina State's Scott) Wood,
this wouldn't have happened.
But he's shown he can guard
some people, he's shown he can
get in the lane, he obviously can
shoot."
Though Stauskas's progress
was clear to see, and his spot in
the starting lineup was prob-
ably overdue, LeVert's presence
on the court was a surprise.
The freshman was long consid-
ered to be a redshirt candidate
because of his raw skills, unde-
veloped frame, and the abun-
dance of senior guards on the
roster.
But his talent appeared to be
too overwhelming for Beilein to
keep him stationed on the bench
the entire year.
"Caris, it was one of these
things where we're saying, our

I

intention is not to just burn
(the redshirt) for two min-
utes a game, but to put him in
there, put him in the top eight
or nine and hopefully he'll play
even more minutes than that,"
Beilein said.
"I loved the way he reacted
to it, and he really wanted to do
it too. If he didn't want to, we
wouldn't have done it. He was
anxious."
The genesis of Beilein's
choice to burn the redshirt
came in Tuesday night's victory.
"I think we saw some things
in the North Carolina State
game where one of his roles will
be, is to be a defensive stopper
out there," Beilein said. "To
really go out and guard some
people."
Beilein also sees it neces-
sary.for LeVert to give junior
guard Tim Hardaway Jr. a
breather. Though Levert only
played seven minutes, grabbing
a rebound and picking up an
assist, Beilein plans to put him
in for Hardaway Jr. more often
to give the Miami native three
or four minutes of rest.
Freshman point guard Spike
Albrecht continues to see time
in order to give Burke a rest, a
situation when Akunne saw
time until Saturday.
Michigan has five seniors,
and none of them played, aside
from Vogrich's four minutes,
perhaps a signal of how Beilein
plans to manage his rotation
down the road.
"You don't want a redshirt

playing two minutes a game,"
Beilein said, referringto LeVert.
"So you gotta take minutes from
somewhere in order to give it to
the young man, but the young
man's proved it and (Vogrich
and Akunne) are ready if we
need them."
In addition to the guards,
Beilein also felt like making
a change in the frontcourt to
accommodate the homecoming
of one of his big men.
Redshirt freshman forward
Max Bielfeldt, who grew up in
Peoria, played a career-high
nine minutes and scored a bas-
ket.
Beilein asked junior cen-
ter Jon Horford, who usually
sees time as the Wolverines'
third post player behind red-
shirt junior Jordan Morgan and
freshman Mitch McGary, to
step back so that Bielfeldt could
shine in front of his friends and
family. Horford was benched
the whole game.
But the gracious move for
Bielfeldt may not just be a one-
time occurrence.
Beilein said that there's a
running competition among the
four big men for playing time,
and that he's still trying to see if
the two-post offense is feasible.
The drawback to that lineup, he
says, is that it forces freshman
forward Glenn Robinson III out
of the lineup or that other play-
ers have to move out of their pri-
mary positions.
"Those four are trying to get
the minutes of three." .

Rosen said.

Michigan chomps Gators

After tradingleads throughout
Saturday's game, the Michigan
women's basketball team pulled
away in the second half to defeat
Florida, 59-53. Led by senior
guard Kate

son's 21 MICHIGAN 59
points, the
Wolverines shot 42.9 percent
from the field to complete a five-
game home stand.
"I thought we definitely had
to grind it out," said Michigan
coach Kim Barnes Arico. "We
struggled in the first half on
things we are typically good at,
like making free throws and hit-
ting open shots.
"Part of it was due to the Flor-
ida defense and their pressure, so
we missed a bunch of things in
the first half that we would nor-
mally make. I was happy to see us
finish a game that we didn't play
exceptionally well in."
The Gatorsscored 32 points on
41.4 percent shooting in the first
half, but Michigan locked down
on defense to hold their oppo-
nents to 21.6 percent from the
field in the second half. Florida
did, however, win the battle for

rebounds, grabbing two more
than the Wolverines' 38 total.
Senior forward Rachel Shef-
fer, who appeared in her 100th
career game, provided 13 points
on 7-for-9 shooting. In her second
consecutive start, senior forward
Nya Jordan secured a season-
high 11 rebounds, followed by
senior guard Jenny Ryan's nine
boards. Ryan, who also dished
out five assists against the Gators,
scored all nine of her points in
the second half.
Florida capitalized on Michi-
gan's first-half woes, scoring 12
points off the Wolverines' eight
turnovers. Michigan struggled
early on to find their offensive
rhythm-and allowed the Gators
to carry out an 11-2 run midway
through the period. Thompson
halted Florida's run by hitting
consecutive baskets from beyond
the arc to kick-start a 9-2 scoring
stretch for the Wolverines.
Despite shooting 1-for-5 from
the free-throw line and giving
up nine second-chance points,
Michigan battled to close the def-
icit before halftime. The Gators,
however, received 15 points off
the bench and relied on defensive
pressure to earn a 32-27 advan-
tage going into the break.
"We weren't really playing like

ourselves the first half," Sheffer
said. "We just got together and
said, 'Come on.' We need to focus
on us and do what we do well."
The Wolverines came out fir-
ing to open the second half, exe-
cuting a 10-0 run generated by
Ryan and Jordan nailing a pair
of 3-pointers. Jordan's 3-pointer,
her first basket from beyond the
arcthisseason, gave Michiganits
first lead of the half.
With dominant interior
defense, the Wolverines refused
to give up their lead for the
remainder of the game. When
foul trouble forced Sheffer to
the bench, senior forward Sam
Arnold stepped in as a valuable
replacement. Michigan then
broke the lead open with a 12-5
run to earn a comfortable seven-
point advantage.
"I thought Sam gave us great
minutes," BarnesAricosaid. "She
did a tremendous job of keeping
thingstogether when Rachel was
out for a long stretch there, so I
was really proud of the minutes
that she gave tonight."
When it appeared the Wolver-
ines had the game under control,
Florida continued to battle back.
With less than three minutes
remaining, the Gators buried a
3-pointer to trim the lead to four,

but it was already too late. Michi-
gan redeemed itself at the char-
ity stripe to close the game, going
4-for-6 at the line to secure a six-
point victory.
"I think that we're getting
better and better at (handling
pressure) each and every time
we play," Barnes Arico said. "The
more that you face something,
obviously the more experience
you have against it, the better
you're hopefully going to attack
it."
. After struggling against No.
4 Duke's full-court press, the
Wolverines effectively handled
Florida's defensive pressure.
Thompson was an offensive
dynamo within the paint, but
also demonstrated her shooting
abilities from the perimeter. In
her fifth-straight game scoring
in double figures, Thompson has
proven to be key for Michigan,
as it has won four of five games
when she scores at least 10 points
this season.
"It all comes back to my team-
mates, they were setting really
good screens," Thompson said.
"Florida is a very aggressive
team within passing lanes, so
they were recognizing when the
switch would come and get me
open."

In a repeat win of the Hawk-

No. 22 Michigan women's swim-

it had somethingto prove.
After three days in the pool,
the Wolverines finished first out

Veterans and new faces alike

just 29 seconds after the Nieves
tally, senior forward Lindsay

third Michigan goal of the peri-
od.
The three Wolverine goals in
just two minutes and 49 seconds
were a pleasant surprise for a
team that has struggled as of late
to find the back of the net. Span-

her two wins on the day.

ROAD TEST
From Page 1B
First off the bench was guard
Nik Stauskas, who usually came
in with forward Mitch McGary.
When preseason All-American
point guard Trey Burke needed
a breather, Spike Albrecht would
take his place.
On Saturday, freshman guard
Caris LeVert entered less than five
minutes into the game, burning
his redshirt. Stauskas started his
firstgame oftheyear, and Albrecht
entered after an early Burke foul.
By the time McGary checked in a
little more than six minutes into
the game, all five freshman had
played.
The inexperience showed at
points, but Michigan righted the
ship after halftime en route to a
74-66 victoryover Bradley.
The nerves were evident early
on for the sharpshooting Staus-
kas. Coming off the bench in every
game this year, he has shota58-per-
cent from beyond the three-point
are - but was 3-for-8 from the
floor in the first half while playing
19 of the 20 minutes.
"I've been out there a lot in pres-
sure situations, so I just played the
game the same way I normally do
and didn't look at it any different-
ly," Stauskas said. "It was a little
bit exciting, but when the game
starts you just gotta do what you
gotta do."
As a team, Michigan (7-0) shot
41-percent from the floor in the
first half, which would have been
good for its worst percentage of
the season if that trend had con-
tinued the entire game.
But the more pressing concern
was turnovers. Michigan had
seven giveaways in the first half,
one more than they did in the
entire game against then-No.18
North CarolinaState last week.
The one saving grace in the
first half was rebounding, which
helped to mask the poor shooting
and giveaways. Michigan record-
ed 10 offensive rebounds, while
the Braves (5-2) had just nine
defensive rebounds. McGary, in
particular, was all over the glass,
pulling down five rebounds in 11
first-half minutes.
The Wolverines entered half-
time up by just four, and Hard-
away, the team's leading scorer at
almost 18 per game, didn't have a
point to go along with his three
turnovers.
And in the second half, Bradley
played like its crowd - roaring,
resilient and ready to go. Michi-
gan kept on attacking, but Brad-
ley wouldn't let the lead balloon.
Teams like Michigan don't play in
Bradley's Missouri Valley Confer-
ence, but the Bravedcountered tal-
ent with tenacity.
"The crowd came today and we
felt it," Burke said. "Every time
they went on a run, we felt it, but
I think we did a really good job of
just staying calm in those situa-
tions."
But that tenacity couldn't last
all game. Bradley finished the
game with 15 turnovers, and it
couldn't keep Michigan off the
glass. The Wolverines finished
with 32 rebounds, 13 of them on
the offensive end.
"They were definitely a really
physical team down low," Morgan
said. "It definitely was a battle,
probably close to ifnotcomparable
to what we will see inthe BigTen."
It wasn't until about 10 minutes

left in the game, when Burke fed
Hardaway for amassive fast break
dunk, that the crowd quieted
down a little bit.
That pushed the Wolverine lead
tlo, and the lead fluttered around
double-digits for the rest of the
game.
Stauskas, like the rest of the
Wolverines, had a much improved
second-half, finishing the game
with a game high 22 points while
shooting 53 percent from the floor.
Back-to-back turnovers by red-
shirt junior forward Jordan Mor-
gan and Hardaway cut Michigan's
lead to seven with a little over a
minute to play, but a Braves turn-
over cost them valuable time and
finished off the game.
Michigan finished the game
-shooting 49-percent from the
floor, but still had 13 turnovers -
tied for the most it's had all year.
Down in the pit, the Wolver-
ines finished off their first true
road game of the year undefeated
amongst the plungers and the
noise.
"Playing here was kind of like
playing on the road somewhere in
the Big Ten," Burke said. "We're
going to have a lot of road games
this year and we're young, but I
think we handled our first real
road game tonight."

of its teams in recent years and
has often struggled mightily in
bowl season, especially against
SEC teams. The conference went
just 4-6 in bowl games last sea-
son, though a Big Ten team won
the Outback Bowl as Michigan
State defeated Georgia.
Michigan hasn't had the
same struggles as its conference
brethren in the past against the
SEC, carrying a 23-7-1 all-time
record against the conference
and a 7-4 mark against it in bowl
games. The Wolverines were
defeated by Mississippi State in
the 2011 Gator Bowl, 52-14, in
their last bowl matchup with an
SEC team. Michigan also lost to
Alabama, 42-14, in the season-
opening Cowboys Classic this
to fully eliminate the rambunc-
tious Ferris State student sec-
tion.
It seemed that the puck con-
stantly ended up deep in Michi-
gan's defensive zone, and Racine
dangerously tested during the
final minutes of the second peri-
od.
With 13:33 remaining in the
third period, Ferris State tied
up the game at three a-piece
when Bonis rifled a wrist shot
past Racine's glove side into.

for his second goal of the game.
This would conclude the scor-
ing for the remainder of regula-
tion. Though the Bulldogs had
the momentum during the final
frame, the Wolverines possessed
the puck and generated more
chances than they had done in

fall.
In South Carolina, Michi-
gan faces a team without its top
offensive player in Marcus Lat-
timore. The talented running
back severely injured his leg
against Tennessee Oct.27, which
knocked him out for the season.
The Gamecocks have managed
to win every game since the
injury though, including their
regular-season finale against
instate rival Clemson.
The Gamecocks are led by
star defensive end Jadeveon
Clowney. The likely future top-
10 NFL draft pick has accrued
13 sacks in his sophomore sea-
son, helping South Carolina rank
fifth nationally with 40 sacks as
a team.
the second period.
"Even though (Ferris State)
got some momentum at times
in the game, our team hung in
there," Berenson said. "Maybe
we didn't capitalize on a couple
of our chances that would have
separated us in the game but
nevertheless give them credit.
They're a good team at home and
they proved it."
The game was to be decided
by a shootout after neither team
generated much offense during
the overtime period.
With the score tied 2-2 after
the first three shooters, junior
forward Luke Moffatt juked
Motte and scored. Racine would
hold strong against the Bulldog's
last shooter, en route to Michi-
gan earning two points on the
weekend.

TRACY KO/Daily
Junior defenseman Mac Bennett and the Michigan hockey team salvaged the weekend with a shootout win Saturday.
Wolverines can get back
on track in December,

By MATT SLOVIN
Daily Sports Writer
BIG RAPIDS - It wouldn't
be a stretch to say that Michi-
gan has yet to put together a full
60 minutes of quality hockey
this season.
But as it found out after Sat-
urday night's 3-3 shootout win
over. Ferris State, the Wolver-
ines don't always have to -
though it would certainly help
them hang onto leads, like the
two-goal advantage they held
over the Bulldogs, that have
been hard to come by.
Friday night, - Michigan
played an opening frame that
coach Red Berenson said was
carried by the Wolverines.
"I thought we came out
strong, and after playing that
first period. I think we all felt
pretty good in the locker room,"
said junior defenseman Mac
Bennett.
But after a solid first 20 min-
utes, the next two periods were
filled with disaster.
"I liked our start again,"
Berenson said Friday. "I look
back on this stretch of games
that we haven't played as well
in at the end, but we played
well at the start. Then the sec-
ond period begins and, for one
reason or another, our game
changes."
After Ferris State finally
scored the game's first goal,
there was an opening of the
floodgates that has been a too-
familiar sight to Michigan so
far this season. In fact, the Bull-
dogs' three-goal second period
marked the sixth time this
year that the Wolverines have
allowed at least that many tal-
lies in a single period.
Bennett readily admit-
ted after the series-opening
loss that the team's mentality
goes awry at times after fall-
ing behind early. Far too often

Commence
a Michigan

month that culminated ina Great
Lakes Invitational title.
Now back to the present day.
Michigan, severely underper-
forming, visited.Ferris State for a
series that straddled November
and December. Friday night loss,
Saturday night shootout win.
November is like a time bomb.
Michigan knows the number
of games in the first half of the
season is waning and that it has
to get on better CCHA footing
before a difficult second half
kicks in.
Michigan coach Red Beren-
son is good at avoiding the panic
zone when the team falters. The
players? It's trickier. It's been
clear to see how easily the team
has gotten down on itself during
games - how aone-goal deficit
has turned into two, then three,
then five, with the Wolverines
rarely coming back to put a point

on the board.
So when the calendar changed
this weekend, it seemed Michi-
gan's game plan also changed
from Friday to Saturday night.
"I thought we played harder
and better," Berenson said. "Even
though they got some momentum
at times in the game, our team
hung in there."
It started with putting togeth-
er a full 60 minutes. Though
walking away from Saturday
nightwith two points instead of
three wasn't ideal, the players
still celebrated like they had won
the whole weekend. When things
don't go your way, everything
gets magnified, and two points
look a lot better than none.
Instead of having only one
strong period on Saturday, Michi-
gan had three - you don't make it
to a sudden-death shootout with-
out everyone on the team pulling
their weight.
The defense put in more effort
to clear the zone and clear out the
crease to assist freshman goalie
Steve Racine when the Bulldogs
swarmed the goal. The offense
finally started firing on multiple
cylinders, with the three goals
each coming from different play-
ers. -
Oh, and don't discredit the
magic of puck luck, either. Just
ask Racine about the shot he
stopped on the goal line between
a post and a player's skate. The
Wolverines haven't had that kind
of luck lately.
"For us to come back and
establish the weekend with a tie
(and) shootout win is big for us,"

said senior forward A.J. Treais.
"I think that everyone's just all
in right now. Everyone's playing
defense ... everyone's bought into
the system nbw."
And then there's mentality.
It's not all about staying.clear-
headed, though that does have
a lot to do with the Wolverines'
performance - off-ice mindsets
have just as much to do with it.
Just look at sophomore Alex
Guptill, one of Michigan's staple
forwards, who didn't even make
the trip to Big Rapids.
Berenson said he wasn't
happy with Guptill's "day-to-day
approach to the game, the team,
his work ethic and his perfor-
mance." Is-it hard scratching
someone who should be a top
scorer while less productive for-
wards see ice time? Yeah. But for
a team that has lacked the mental
conditioning to make it through
a game, Berenson needed some-
one that was all in. His gamble
of a better attitude trumping a
less effective player didn't hurt
on Saturday. Does this weekend
mark the turning pointin the.
Wolverines' underachieving
season? Perhaps. An upcoming
bye week gives Michigan extra
practice time to readjust before
playing Western Michigan.
But the best thing about fac-
ing the Broncos? It will still
be December. And maybe the
Wolverines can hold on to that
December magic that'sbeen so
good to them before.

gan come out sharp and com-
petitive, only to look flat-footed
and shell shocked as the games
wear on. -
"That's something we need
to be better at," Bennett said.
"Our mental toughness is a
huge part of this game. Espe-
cially in college hockey, you can
get a good bounce here or there
- you can go down or go up. If
we can be mentally tough, we'll
be in a good place."
Saturday was different,
though. Instead of packing
it in after the quick Bulldog
goal, Michigan seemed to play
with more intensity. Early in
the game, freshman forward
Andrew Copp rallied the bench,
delivering some :much-needed
energy into a lineup that had
failed to produce offensive
chances recently.
"I like the way our team put
that behind them and slowly
took over the game," Berenson
said. "Rather than let it bother

us or upset us, we moved on."
That's when the Wolver-
ines began to fight back with
three goals of their own. But as
evidenced by the Ferris State
comeback that brough the game
to overtime, Michigan isn't yet
able to play consistently for a
full game.
Freshman goaltender Steve
Racine gave the Wolverines a
chance to win the game Sat-
urday, and they did so despite
their inability to control all
three periods. By the end of the
second, Ferris State was clearly
closing in on an equalizer, and
the Bulldogs missed several
opportunities to win it in the
third.
As long as Michigan con-
tinues to play more tentatively
with leads, or self destruct
when it trails early on, it's going
to be difficult put together a full
60 minutes. First, the Wolver-
ines must eliminate the goals
that come in bunches.
