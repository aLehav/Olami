The alleyway between
Momo Tea and Insomnia
Cookies was filled with stu-
dents on Friday, but they
weren't standing outside to
buy tea or cookies they were
hanging around to get a taste
of Detroit.
Crowd 313, a student-run
organization that seeks to
better connect University
students with cultural and
entrepreneurial offerings in
Detroit, kicked off their first
event with the 2013 Detroit
Sound Fest at Eat the Hub, a
new food-cart development
on South University Avenue.
The event brought the
Motor City to Ann Arbor
with Detroit bands and food
in hopes of improving the
city's reputation among the
University community.
The Sound Fest featured
four Detroit musicians,
including The Hand in the
Ocean, Kickstand Band,
Little Animal and DJs Man-
uel Gonzalez and Conor
Mendenhall. Food was also
available from Detroit and
Ann Arbor-based vendors,
including The Beetbox

Cheese Dream, Cafe Con
Leche, El Manantial and
Hut-K Nutrilicious.
Art & Design junior Matt
Rosner, executive of Crowd
313, said the biggest goal of
the event was to engage stu-
dents with a positive Detroit
experience despite pervasive
negative media coverage.
"Everyone has a different
perception of Detroit, but
overall it is a negative view,"
Rosner said.
Jordan Evans, a musician
in The Hand in the Ocean,
said it's easy for students to
talk negatively about Detroit
because of the city's econom-
ic decline, bankruptcy, aban-
doned buildings and crime.
He said he hopes to show
Detroit's creative side and
motivate students to rethink
their perspective through
the band's music.
"You really have to get past
that thought to see what is
really going on Downtown,"
said Business sophomore Mer-
edith Bury, on-campus event
coordinator for Crowd 313.
Bury added that once stu-
dents see the positive things
Detroit has to offer, it will be
easy for them to change their
view.
Rosner said he was very
optimistic about the turn-
out of the event - despite
the cold - and the future of
Detroit. He said there will
more events in the future to
showcase the city's diverse
opportunities for students,

It's easy to lose track of the
spirit of the season during late-
night cramming for final exams.
However, the University
Health Sciences Scholars Pro-
gram's community service club,
has made it easy to give back to'
the community with its "Giving
Tree" initiative, benefiting stu-
dents ina Detroit-area school.
As a part of the project, the,
organization has decorated a col

umn outside the Couzens Resi-
dence Hall's community center
with 143 holiday light-shaped
tags inscribed with information
on a student from the Academy
of International Studies char-
ter school in Hamtramck, Mich.
Couzens residents can take a tag
off the column and purchase a
present for a student
"We thought it would be a fab-
ulous way to get everyone in the
giving spirit," said LSA freshman
Victoria Chochla, HSSP's com-
munity service representative.
Couzens residents can con-
tinrue to donate gifts through Dec.
once the gift drive closes, club
ers will wrap presents and
se gifts for any remaining
fore delivery to the school

before winter break.
"The school is very happy
that we reached out and part-
nered with them," Chochla said.
"It's really nice because we have
students from the University of
Michigan partnered with stu-
dents from a charter school in
Hamtramck, so you have that stu-
dent connection between older
students and younger students.
It's really nice and it makes the
holidays."
LSA senior Jacqueline Frank-
lin, head of HSSP's community
service club, said manynon-HSSP
Couzens residents, staff and
facilities workers have also par-
ticipated in the gift drive. Out of

Right from the outset, Detroit
Emergency Financial Manager
Kevyn Orr spoke bluntly and
honestly about the city's condi-
tion.
"itold your applause until
you hear what I have to say," he
said, after being introduced as
the keynote speaker at Friday's
fourth-annual Revitalization &
Business Conference at the Ross
School of Business.
In March, Orr was appointed
by Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder to
handle Detroit's ongoing bank-
ruptcy proceedings and to create
a sustainable plan for the city's
financial health. On Tuesday, a
federal judge ruled that Detroit
is eligible for bankruptcy - mak-
ing its $18 billion default the larg-
est municipal financial failure
in U.S. history. The city's insol-
vency has caused distress among
Detroit residents, who are coping
with reduced city services. Retir-
ees who worked for the city also
face steep cuts to their pensions,
a sticking point of the judge's rul-
ing.
Orr opened the conference by
giving an overview and progress
report on Detroit's recovery. He
described Detroit as a city criti-

FOOD AND FUN

The University sought about
$22.6 million from the Michi-
gan state legislature to cover
operation costs and research
efforts. This additional rev-
enue represented a $2.8 mil-
lion increase from the previous
year.
The money was also intend-
ed to support the University's
growing student body, which
was expected to rise from
17,500 in 1953 to about 18,500 in
1954. This included a $150,000
increase to cover the cost of the
50 medical students enrolled in
the medical school.

Members of the Universi-
ty's Gay Awareness Women's
Kollective appeared before
the Ann Arbor human rights
department to file complaints
against a local restaurant
owner, Greg Fenerli, who had
"clashed" with the women in
the prior weeks when they
attempted to visit his bar,
Rubaiyat.
Fenerli, who criticized
the women's "openly sexual
behavior," said he applied the
same standards to gay couples
that he applied to heterosexual
ones.

A study conducted by The
Michigan Daily concluded new
professors at the University were
paid more than those with more
experience.
Professors working at the Uni-
versity for fewer than three years
earned approximately $101,000
per year on average, while those
working for 30 years or longer
averaged about $78,000. Overall,
the Daily reported the "median
salary for every category of pro-
fessors rigidly follows the trend
of decreased pay with longer
employment."

Prosecutors decline to press
charges against bus driver

Donor pledges $5 million to
protect Detroit art, retirees

Student originally
charged with
abandoning bus
will not face trial
By SAM GRINGLAS
DailyStaffReporter
The Washtenaw County pros-
ecutor will not press charges
against the 22-year-old student
bus driver who left a Blue Bus
unattended during his shift last
month.
Steven Hiller, Washtenaw
County chief deputy assistant
prosecutor, said charges were
denied on Nov. 20.
Though University Police
initially arrested the student
on charges of unlawfully driv-
ing away of an automobile,
Hiller said if the prosecutor
had pressed charges, the more
appropriate charge would have

been akin to joyriding - motor
vehicle use without authority
and without intent to steal. That
charge would carry the weight
of a misdemeanor.
If charged, a conviction could
lead to imprisonment for no
more than two years or a fine of
up to $1,500. For a first offense,
the court may reduce the pun-
ishment to imprisonment for no
more than three months or a fine
of no more than $500.00.
However, the statute does
not apply in situations where
the vehicle's owner employs the
driver, as was the case here. As a
result, there was no statute upon
which the prosecutor could
press charges.
"There wasn't an appropriate
statute that fit these facts," Hill-
er said. "That happens."
This situation isn't uncom-
mon. When making an arrest,
officers base their decision on
their best understanding of the
law and known facts at the time

of the arrest. Later, prosecutors
may find that charges aren't
warranted.
"So it is not uncommon for an
officer to arrest, quite properly,
for offense A, based on what the
officer knows at that time, and
later have the prosecutor charge
offense B, return the case for
further investigation or deny
prosecution altogether," Hiller
said.
Though the prosecutor did
not press charges, University
spokesman Rick Fitzgerald
said the University no longer
employs the student. He said he
is unaware of any further conse-
quences for the student.
Fitzgerald also pointed out
that the University has no
stake in the prosecutor's deci-
sion on whether or not to press
charges.
"It's up to the prosecutor to
determine whether it's appro-
priate to press charges or not,"
Fitzgerald said.

A. Paul Schaap
seeks to prevent sale
of DIA holdings
DETROIT (AP) - A former
Detroit university professor is
pledging $5 million, hoping it
will spark a wildfire of private
financial support to protect
valuable art from being sold to
pay creditors in the city's bank-
ruptcy.
A. Paul Schaap said he wants
to help the Detroit Institute of
Arts as well as retirees whose
pensions could be cut as part
of the city's plan to eventually
exit Chapter 9 bankruptcy. Art
purchased over the years with
city money could be pursued
as assets that should be sold to
pay off a portion of $18 billion in
long-term debt.
Schaap and wife Carol want
to prevent that from happening.
"I believe there are more than

just a few people in the metro
Detroit area who would step up
and see this as something we
should all try to do to save the
pensions and stabilize the DIA,"
Schaap said in an interview Fri-
day.
Detroit emergency manager
Kevyn Orr hasn't said whether
he will sell art as part of any
bankruptcy reorganization
plan. New York auction house
Christie's said art purchased
with city money is worth $450
million to $870 million. It's 5
percent of all art at the Detroit
Institute of Arts.
"We have a passion for the
city," said Schaap, who lives
next door in Grosse Pointe Park
and was a Wayne State Univer-
sity chemistry professor before
starting his own technology
company. "We go to the DIA,
the symphony, ballgames. We're
Detroiters. Maybe this is a way
to help."
Schaap, 68, said he was meet-

ing Friday with U.S. District
Judge Gerald Rosen, who is serv-
ing as chief mediator between
the city and its creditors while
the bankruptcy case moves for-
ward. The Detroit News and
Detroit Free Press have reported
that Rosen has reached out to
foundations and wealthy people
to try to raise as much as $500
million to protect the museum
and assist pensioners.
Schaap said he read about
Rosen's effort and decided to
step forward, becoming one
of the first to publicly make a
pledge. The judge and others
in the philanthropic commu-
nity have declined to comment,
although Orr this week said he
"fully supports" Rosen's pitch to
potential donors.
"I've already heard from
people who can't give that much
but want to contribute," Schaap
said, referring to his $5 million.
"We will be looking for a mecha-
nism to make that possible."

* * * Q **U Ukraine protests continue in capital

Demonstrators
gather in largest
anti-govt. rally since
Orange Revolution
KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Hun-
dreds of thousands of protest-
ers poured into the streets of
Ukraine's capital on Sunday, top-
pling a statue of former Soviet
leader Vladimir Lenin and block-
ading key government buildings
in an escalating standoff with
the president over the future of
the country.
The biggest demonstration
in the former Soviet republic
since Ukraine's pro-democracy
Orange Revolution in 2004 led
the government to fire back. It
announced an investigation of
opposition leaders for an alleged
attempt to seize power and
warned the demonstrators they

could face criminal charges.
The West pressed for a peace-
ful settlement.
Hundreds of thousands of
Ukrainians flooded the center
of Kiev, the capital, to demand
President Viktor Yanukovych's
ouster after he ditched ties with
the European Union in favor of
Russia and sent police to break
up an earlier protest inthe nearly
three-week standoff.
"Ukraine is tired of Yanu-
kovych. We need new rules. We
need to completely change those
in power," said protester Kosty-
antyn Meselyuk, 42. "Europe
can help us."
Packing Independence Square
as far as the eye could see, Ukrai-
nians waving EU flags sang the
national anthem and shouted
"Resignation!" and "Down with
the gang!" in a reference to Yan-
ukovych's regime.
"I am convinced that after
these events, dictatorship will

never survive in our country,"
world boxing champion and top
opposition leader Vitali Klitsch-
ko told reporters. "People will
not tolerate when they are beat-
en, when their mouths are shut,
when their principles and values
are ignored."
As darkness fell, the conflict
escalated further with protest-
ers blockading key government
buildings in Kiev with cars, bar-
ricades and tents.
The protests have had an anti-
Russian component because
Russia had worked aggres-
sively to derail the EU deal
with threats of trade retaliation
against Ukraine.
About half a mile (1 kilometer)
from the main square, one group
of anti-government protest-
ers toppled the city's landmark
statue of Lenin and decapitated
it Sunday evening.
Protesters then took turns
beating on the torso of the fall-

en statue, while others lined up
to collect a piece of the stone.
The crowd chanted "Glory to
Ukraine!"
"Goodbye, Communist leg-
acy," Andriy Shevchenko, an
opposition lawmaker, wrote on
Twitter.
The demonstrations erupted
last month after Yanukovych
shelved a long-planned treaty
with the 28-nation European
Union to focus on ties with Rus-
sia. They were also galvanized
by police violence and fears that
Yanukovych was on the verge
of bringing his country into a
Russian-led economic alliance,
which critics say could end
Ukraine's sovereignty.
"It's not just a simple revo-
lution," Oleh Tyahnybok, an
opposition leader with the
national Svoboda party, told the
crowd in a fiery speech from a
giant stage. "It's a revolution of
dignity."

Thai parliament dissolved

Surprise move
comes as protestors
threaten govt.
overthrow
BANGKOK (AP) - Thailand's
prime minister announced
Monday she will dissolve the
lower house of Parliament and
call elections in an attempt to
calm the country's deepening
political crisis. The surprise
move came as 100,000 protest-
ers vowing to overthrow her
government marched through
the streets of Bangkok for a
"final showdown."
Prime Minister Yingluck Shi-
nawatra's appeared emotional
and her voice shook as she spoke
in a nationally televised address
Monday morning.
"After listening to opinions
from all sides, I have decided
to request a royal decree to dis-
solve Parliament," Yingluck
said, breaking into regular pro-
graming. "There will be new
elections according to the demo-
cratic system."
She said the Election Com-
mission would set a date "as
soon as possible."
It was unclear whether the
move would ease the country's.
political standoff, which deep-
ened Sunday after the main
opposition party resigned from
the legislature en masse. Pro-
test leader Suthep Thaugsuban
has repeatedly said that calling

fresh elections would not be
enough to end the conflict, and
he made no immediate comment
on Yingluck's announcement.
Police estimated that about
100,000 protesters were out on
the streets of the Thai capital.
Thailand has been plagued
by political turmoil since the
army toppled Yingluck's broth-
er Thaksin in a 2006 coup. In
broad terms, the conflict pits
the Thai elite and the educated
middle-class against Thaksin's
power base in the countryside,
which benefited from populist
policies designed to win over
the rural poor.
"We will rise up. We will
walk on every street in the coun-
try. We will not be going home
again," Suthep said Sunday. His
supporters have occupied the
Finance Ministry and part of a
vast government complex for
more than a week. "The people
who will be going home empty-
handed are those in the Thaksin
regime."
Many feared the day could
end violently when demon-
strators converge from nine
locations on Yingluck's office
at Government House. More
than 60 Thai and international
schools in Bangkok have closed
as a precaution.
As Yingluck spoke, long col-
umns of protesters paralyzed
traffic on major Bangkok boule-
vards. They filled a major four-
lane road in the city's central
business district, waving flags,

blowing whistles and holding a
huge banner that said, "Get Out
Shinawatra."
Since the latest unrest began
last month, at least five people
have been killed and at least 289
injured. Violence ended sud-
denly last week as both sides
paused to celebrate the birthday
of the nation's revered king, who
turned 86 Thursday.
The crisis boiled over after
Yingluck's ruling party tried to
ram a controversial amnesty bill
through the legislature. Critics
say it was designed mainly to
bring back Thaksin, who lives
in self-imposed exile in Dubai to
avoid jail time for a corruption
conviction he says was politi-
cally motivated.
Abhisit Vejjajiva, the leader
of the Democrat party and a
former premier, said Yingluck's
government had become "ille-
gitimate" since then, and his
party had no choice but to pull
out of the lower house. The
Democrats held 153 of the 500
seats in the legislative body,
according to the latest figures
on their website. Abhisit said
the resignations were effective
immediately.
"The solution to our current
problems needs to start with
the showing of responsibil-
ity," Abhisit said. "The prime
minister has never showed any
responsibility or conscience."

Copper Peak jump
looks for comeback
to world stage
IRONWOOD, Mich. (AP) -
It's been nearly 20 years since
athletes soared into the sky off
the Copper Peak ski jump near
Ironwood, Mich. But change is
in the air.
The board that operates the
western Upper Peninsula land-
mark is backing a new plan they
hope will put Copper Peak back
on the international stage and
attract athletes from around
the world for ski jumping - and
not just in the winter, accord-
ing to the Duluth (Minn.) News
Tribune.
"This is really big news
for ski jumping in the United
States," said Bryan Sanders, a
1992 U.S. ski jumping Olympian
and member of the Copper Peak
board. "This makes us relevant
again on the world scene."
Two key components of the
plan are transforming Copper
Peak from its present status as
a ski-flying hill to a ski-jumping
hill, and bringing summer ski
jumping to the venue by 2016.
Copper Peak, which opened
in 1970, features a 267-foot
steel jump structure - that's
about 26 stories high - built
atop a 365-foot rock outcrop-
ping about 10 miles northeast of
Ironwood.
Ski flying is similar to ski
jumping but takes place on
larger hills that allow for longer
jumps.
Copper Peak had been the
only ski flying hill in the West-
ern Hemisphere - and one of
just six in the world - but it was
small for that circuit.
So the Copper Peak board,

backing from the Federation
of International Skiing (FIS),
wants to make the transition to
the largest ski-jumping hill in
the world.
"We haven't flown at Copper
Peak in a number of years. Our
hill has not progressed in size
(as other slopes) have length-
ened their landing slopes," said
Charlie Supercynski, president
of the Copper Peak board. "So
the question is, what kind of
a hill are we? Are we a small
flying hill, or do we want to
become a large jumping hill?"
And the answer, backed by a
unanimous vote of the Copper
Peak board last month, is to fol-
low the FIS plan and switch to
ski jumping. That will require,
among other renovations,
reshaping the hill to meet FIS
ski jumping specifications.
In conjunction with the
switch from ski flying to ski
jumping, the plan envisioned by
FIS and the Copper Peak board
includes the addition of sum-
mer ski jumping.
How does summer ski jump-
ing work?
The landing zone "is essen-
tially skiing on plastic - a spe-
cially designed surface that
looks like spaghetti that you
stack up like shingles on a roof,"
Supercynski said. It approxi-
mates snow, allowing skiers to
glide along as they land.
The jump itself would be
outfitted with ceramic tile or a
refrigerated ice surface - that's
still to be determined - that
athletes would glide down to
make their runs.
The sport has grown in pop-
ularity in Europe because the
warmer weather conditions are
more favorable for fans, and
there are fewer variables for
skiers to contend with. Events

The startup is housed in a

After NY train
derailing, pair of
lawmakers demand
new safety measures
NEW YORK (AP) - A week
after four people died in a New
York commuter train derailment,
two federal lawmakers proposed
Sunday that trains nationwide
be outfitted with cameras point-
ed at engineers and at the tracks.
"I know you're going to hear
from Metro-North that there are
costs, but the costs of these audio
and visual recorders is minus-
cule, in fact negligible, compared
to the hundreds of millions of
dollars that this tragic incident
will cost Metro-North in the
end," said Sen. Richard Blumen-
thal of Connecticut who joined
New York Sen. Charles Schumer
for a news conference at Man-
hattan's Grand Central Termi-
nal.
Last Sunday, a Metro-North
Railroad train approached a
curve on the tracks just north
of Manhattan going 82 mph -
nearly three times 30 mph speed
limit. Rail cars careened off the
tracks, with the front car ending
up inches from the water where
the Hudson River meets the
Harlem River.
A lawyer and union leader
for the derailed train's engineer,
William Rockefeller, have said
the train's hypnotic motion may
have caused him to experience a
"nod" or a "daze" at the controls.
The Democratic lawmakers
are urging the Federal Railroad
Administration to demand the
implementation of a measure
they say might prevent the kind
of deadly Metro-North derail-
ment that also left dozens of
people injured.
The National Transportation

Safety Board first recommend-
ed installation of the audio and
video recording cameras in loco-
motives and operating railway
cabs five years ago.
The railroad administration
issued a statement saying that
safety was its "highest priority"
and 2012 was the safest year in
railroading history.
"We support the use of cam-
eras in cabs to further improve
safety," the agency said, adding
that it continues to work with
the NTSB on the investigation
into the New York accident.
The NTSB said it has a
"long history of advocating for
improvements stemming from
fatal accidents."
"In an era where the average
citizen has a device in their pock-
et capable of recording audio
and video, installing cameras in
locomotives for accident investi-
gation and prevention purposes
simply moves the railroad indus-
try into the 21st century," NTSB
Chairman Deborah A.F. Hers-
man said in a statement.
Schumer said fatigue was
suspected in two other colli-
sions - one in Iowa, in 2011
and another in Newton, Mass.,
in 2008 - and might have been
proven if cameras were present.
He said such images might have
caught behavior patterns that
could have been prevented in the
future.
"Get on board and implement
these recommendations now,"
Schumer said, directing his com-
ments to the Federal Railroad
Administration, which has the
power to demand the changes.
The railroad administration has
yet totake any regulatory action
putting these recommendations
in place.
"Shame on Metro-North for
failing to adopt this system,"
Blumenthal said. "Shame on the
operators of this railroad for

failing to move forward with a
recommendation that is so cost
effective. Keep people alive."
The Metropolitan Transpor-
tation Authority, which runs
Metro-North, released a state-
ment late Sunday detailing
immediate changes to improve
safety on curves and bridges.
Those improvements include
the installation of new sig-
nal safety protections at the
crash site that - starting Mon-
day - will warn engineers of
approaching speed reductions
and automatically apply the
train's emergency brakes if
speed is not lowered to the 30
mph maximum in the curve.

A health ter transition
Michigan's Medicaid expansion gives needed support to ex-inmates
 rn 2014, the Affordable Care Act will expand Medicaid to cover all adults
earning less than 38-percent above the federal poverty level; a large
portion of these beneficiaries will be former prison inmates and detain-
ees. Michigan will expand its Medicaid program to help cover the health-
care costs of released offenders and current inmates who require long-term
hospitalization or other specialized care outside of prison. This expansion
of Medicaid will be financially beneficial to the state. Furthermore, the new
benefits available may help former inmates adjust to independent living and
could be a way to curb recidivism and improve the lives of former prisoners.

ike every Public Policy stu-
dent, I look forward to holi-
days not just for the food, or
the presents, or
the avoidance
of doing a load
of laundry, but
because of the
inevitable politi-
cal banter that
goes on in every
U.S. household PATRICK
when extended MAILLET
families reunite.
Whether alco-
hol-induced or
not, most families will likely have at
least one political conversation on
Thanksgiving. This year was certain-
ly no exception with the government
shutdown still pretty fresh in all of
our minds, nuclear talks with Iran,
and of course, the wildly successful
rollout of HealthCare.gov.
In my family, you better know
what you're talking about when it
comes to politics. If you make a stu-
pid argument or a baseless claim,
there's no doubt that someone will
bury you for it. For years, I've been
arguingthat all Mailletholiday fam-
ily functions should have a stenog-
rapher present for this exact reason.
Growing up, I remember sitting
around the table after Thanksgiv-
ing dinner arguing about former
President George Bush's torture
policies with the grownups in my
family while all the other kids
played downstairs. Sure, these
were the early signs of beinga mas-
sive political geek, but that's how
I learned how to express an argu-
ment and how to win a debate.
Although these debates inevi-
tably happen year in and year out,
I can't help but feel that they have
grown more militant over the past

couple years. Where we once may
have agreed on certain things, now
it seems like every time a debate
happens within my family, both
people leave the conversation more
entrenched in their own perspec-
tive with little understanding of
how someone could possibly see
another side.
One debate that I always look
forward to is the one that inevitably
breaks out between Uncle Jim and
me. While I do love Jim dearly, let's
just say he and I don't exactly see
eye-to-eye on just about anything in
terms of politics. For starters, Jim
thinks Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas)
should be our next president. Need
I say more?
Jim is a proud Tea Partier and
still truthfully believes that Presi-
dent Barack Obama was born
in Kenya. I don't really take the
"birther" claims seriously anymore,
but this year, Jim said something
that truly resonated with me.
In the heat of a conversation,
while Jim and I were screaming at
each other as the rest of the family
desperately tried to hold a conver-
sation in the other room, Jim said,
"Obama is your president, not mine."
This statement made me take a
step back. Where could the conver-
sation go from here? If we couldn't
agree on the very concept that
Obama is the commander-in-chief
of our nation, then what else is there
to talk about?
Even after the Thanksgiving
plates were cleared and everyone
gave their goodbye hugs, Jim's
words stuck with me.
Never, even in the darkest of
times during the Bush administra-
tion, did I ever think that the for-
mer Texas governor George Bush
was not my president. I know this is

easy to say in hindsight, but if Mitt
Romney had won last November, I
would be calling him "my president."
I might not be happy about it, but I
would still respect the office.
The reason that Jim's statement
haunted me so much was because
I immediately realized that he
wasn't alone in this belief. Millions
of Americans do not even acknowl-
edge Obama as their president. More
importantly, many elected officials
do not make this acknowledgment.
Any bill that Obama presents to Con-
gress is immediately shut down.
Why? Not because it may be good
or bad or partisan or bipartisan, but
because it has the president's name
on it. Tea Party candidates obviously
can't support anything backed by
Obama - they are elected in districts
where voters don't recognize Obama
as their president!
Our democracy is not based on the
concept that the minority justdoesn't
have to acknowledge the legitimacy
of the opposition party. Across the
country, we are seeing extremism on
either side of the political spectrum
rewarded. While compromise used
to be an inevitable part of govern-
ment, it has now become a surefire
way for a candidate to lose his or
her upcoming primary. We need to
start respecting each other and not
entrench ourselves so deeply into our
respective parties that we are inca-
pable of accepting that the other side
might have a good idea every once in
awhile.
Our conversations need to start
being a lot more civil, otherwise the
only thing Jim and I will have to talk
about on Thanksgiving is, well... tur-
key.

Upon release from prison, former inmates
face a myriad of barriers to successful rein-
tegration into society. In some cases, former
inmates may not have a basic level of edu-
cation. Without support for and access to
basic services, housing or health care, many
inmates are released into a familiarly hope-
less environment, and recidivism becomes a
vicious cycle. Expansion of Medicaid to cover
the recently released will significantly reduce
some of inmates' stress of readjusting to
independent life. Michigan has already been
using state funds for reintegration programs
that include health care - in the past five
years, the state has seen its prison population
decrease from 51,554 to 43,636.
A key element of Medicaid expansion is
its coverage of continuous mental-health
care for current and former prison inmates.
Mental health is an oft-neglected segment of
healthcare programs in general, but it plays
an especially large role in the prison popula-
tion and the effort to decrease the incidence
of repeat offenders. Because mental illness is
sooften ignoreduntil incidence ofamajor dis-
turbance, the mentally ill are disproportion-
ately represented in the prison population.
According to the National Institute of Health,

56.2 percent of inmates in state prisons have
a mental illness, compared with 26.2 percent
of adult members of the general population.
In order to reduce recidivism, it's crucial to
address both the mental and physical health
of former inmates. After using limited state
funds to assist released offenders with spe-
cial needs, most of which were mental disor-
ders, Michigan's recidivism rates decreased
by half between 1998 and 2012. Expansion
of Medicaid will significantly increase funds
available to provide continuing mental health
care for inmates.
Additionally, Michigan will reap financial
benefits from expansion of Medicaid. The fed-
eral government will take over more coverage
of inmates who are enrolled in specialized
care outside of the prison system, but more
importantly, reduction of repeatoffenders will
save the state thousands of dollars per inmate.
Expanded health care for former inmates will
cost roughly $2,000 per person, versus $3,500
each year for every imprisoned inmate.
The state's expansion of Medicaid for
inmates will be a welcome change and will
improve the quality of life for impoverished
or mentally ill former inmates and greatly
assist their reintegration into society.

As I sit on the couches in The
Michigan Daily newsroom,
writing my last column, I
can't help but
smile at how
things have
come full circle.
I walked into
this place the
first week of my
freshman year,
not knowing H SHA
the first thing NAHATA
about writing
for a newspaper.
I had no idea at
the time what the Daily would grow
to mean to me.
From late night shifts to elec-
tions that run until 5 a.m., from
heated editorial board debates to
difficult endorsement decisions,
the memories are endless. I can't
begin to sum up how big of an
impact the Daily has made on my
college experience. It has not only
been an outlet for my jumbled up
thoughts, but a platform for my
voice. Beyond that, it's the only
reason I'm now semi-competent in
Photoshop and InDesign. I really
can't thank this place enough.
Coming into college, I never
considered myself a writer. I still
remember my first editorial read
through with an editor. I came in
on a Sunday afternoon to sit down
with the editorial page editor and
went over my article. I was ter-
rified going into it. I didn't know
anything about Daily style - I still
used oxford commas - or how to
structure an editorial. And I got
quite a few edits. But none of that
compared to the feeling of seeing

my writing in print the next day. I
was hooked..
Writing became my way of mak-
ing sense of the world. I fell in love
with words and the ways in which
they can be used to communicate
ideas, stories and beliefs. To raise
awareness or advocate for a cause or
simply make someone laugh. There's
that indescribable feeling you get
when you've found the perfect word
to describe what you want to say,
and you know that the person read-
ing it, will, if only for a second, pic-
ture exactly what you've imagined.
I've grown so much these past
years, both as a writer and a stu-
dent, and I have the Daily to thank
for much of it. Having a column
is constantly putting yourself out
there, but in the best way possible.
It's a series of feedback, in person,
through e-mails and Facebook
comments - sometimes angry,
sometimes encouraging, but always
educational. It is the opportunity
to be constantly challenged about
your views, and to learn from the
people surrounding you. And I
wouldn't have it any other way.
By the time senior year rolls
around, you start spending a
lot of time thinking about what
you'll leave behind, what people
will remember you for, what your
"legacy" will be. One of my favor-
ite quotes is by filmmaker Robert
Bresson: "Make visible what with-
out you might never have been
seen." And, if nothing else, I hope
my column has done that. I hope it
has added value and made you see
things in a way slightly different
than how you had seen them before.
Walking through Palmer Com-

mons on Sunday, I noticed a ques-
tion posed on the big chalkboard;
"Every 26 seconds someone drops
out of high school. What can you do
in 26 seconds?"
I can do alot in 26 seconds, I can
write a sentence; I can do a math
problem; I can send a Snapchat ...
maybe two. I can even learn a little
bit more about education inequality.
That's not why I'm bringing this
up. Bynow, you know this isn't a col-
umn about the public education sys-
tem. Experiences like this continue
to remind me how blessed I am.
Blessed to have the opportunity to
be at such a great university, to voice
my opinion and have people actually
read it, to be surroundedby so many
individuals who care so passionately
about different causes, to have the
resources to make an impact.
By the very nature of our degree,
we're going to leave the University
in a position to make a difference.
They say college isn't just a place
you go to get a degree, but a place
that makes you a better citizen,
a better thinker. I can't speak for
everyone, but I know that has been
resoundingly true of my college
experience.
So in my final column I have a
call for action for you. There are
many problems to solve and oppor-
tunities to create positive change
- regardless what field we may be
going into. I hope you are able to
use the experiences and knowledge
you've gained here to give back to
someone, somewhere, in some way,
no matter how big or small.

cal to the history of the state,
country and world, as it was cen-
tral to the origin of the organized
labor movement, the expansion
of the middle class and the birth
of cars, commuting and transpor-
tation.
The most elemental com-
ponent of the city's financial
distress, Orr said, is its rapid
population decline. Once a city of
1.8 million residents in the 1950s,
Detroit's population is now just
over 700,000 and the city has lost
close to 240,000 residents in the
last decade alone.
Compounding the popula-
tion decline is Detroit's physi-
cal enormity: the entire cities of
New York City, Boston and San
Francisco can fit inside Detroit's
139-square-mile border. While
the city's revenue stream from
property and income taxes has
shrunk because of the dwindling
population, the city remains as
geographically large. Thus, the
costs to maintain city infrastruc-
ture and services remain the
same while the budget to fund it
continues to shrink.
This dynamic has created a
complex accumulation of chal-
lenges for the city to provide its
essential services. For instance,
the city can afford to keep just 60
percent of its street lamps lit on
any given day - leading to a host
of problems for law enforcement
and emergency services.
"Turn a city dark, you will see
. crime," Orr said. "It's very sim-
ple."
The city's rising crime rate is
also driven by "economic dispar-
ity, hopelessness and helpless-
ness," Orr said. Yet thanks to the
city's vast size and decreased
police force, it often takes close to
an hour for authorities to respond
to emergencies.
Another persistent issue is
the city's bus system, which Orr
says reaches its routes on time at
just a 65-percent rate. The pub-

lit school system does not have
its own buses, so young children
ride the city buses to and from
school, enduring long wait times
in the cold, unlit and crime-rid-
den streets - a combination that
Orr worries is a detriment to edu-
cation.
In addition to detailing the
flawed distribution of services,
Orr also outlined the extent of
the city's $18 billion in debt obli-
gations, which, if not addressed
soon, could make the financial
situation even worse. Private
enterprise secures $6 billion
of that debt, and most of the
remaining $12 billion is related to
employmentcand retiree cost: $5.7
billion for health care costs for
retirees, $3.5 billion for unfunded
pension obligations, and $1.4 bil-
lion in bond debt used to pay into
the pension system.
As difficult as it is to accept,
Orr said the city has no choice but
to readjust and reduce its finan-
cial obligations, meaning that
many pensioners will not receive
the retirement income they were
once promised.
These tough choices underlie
the enormity of Orr's task. Unlike
the bankruptcy and restructur-
ing process in the private sector
- Orr also represented Chrysler
LLC when it filed for Chapter 11
in 2009 - there is a human ele-
ment inherent to these proceed-
ings.
Orr's address laid the frame-
work for the rest of the conference
held by the Detroit Revitalization
& Business Initiative, a student-
run organization in the Business
School whose mission is to help
students learn about Detroit,
engage with the community and
commit to contributing to its
revitalization.
"(Orr) really was able to con-
nect the hard, cold numerical
facts with the real human truths
of the challenges facing Detroit,"
Business graduate student Nir-
mal Deshpande said. "It puts
what we're learning here into a
very clear context."
The theme of Friday's con-

ference was "Growth and
Regrowth," exploring the new
industries that will drive the city
and investigating how to reinvig-
orate the traditional sectors that
made the city strong. The confer-
ence, which was attended mostly
by graduate business students,
included panels on the inter-
section between education and
business, as well as a forum for
students interested in working in
the city upon graduation.
"As a lot of us try to figure out
where we're going to settle, it
makes you think twice about, 'Do
I wantto go to Chicago, doI want

ization (in Detroit),"' Deshpande
said.
Faculty, as well as students,
seemed to view Orr's address
positively.
Business lecturer Peter Allen
said in an e-mail interview that
he was impressed with Orr's
resolve to have a two-year budget
and 10-year projection in place by
the time his appointment ends 10
months from now, and was also
pleased with Orr's apparent will-
ingness to work in concert with
the city's elected officials.
Emergency financial manag-
ers have been criticized by many
for having too much power and
being able to override the power
of elected officials.
"Overall, if I were a Detroit
investor, I would feel very com-
fortable making an investment
today," Allen wrote.
The attendees' seeming-
ly favorable reaction to Orr's
remarks reflect that, while
unequivocal in his assessment of
the city's fiscal state, he was able
to inject a dose of optimism as
well.
"At the end of the day, there
are twothings I have to leave this
process with," Orr said. "A city
that functions effectively and
some semblance of hope that peo-
ple who depend on these services
to live, will be able to live out rest
of their lives with some form of
dignity and hope."

Mourners pray and sing to celebrate the life of Nelson Mandela outside his old house in Soweto, Johannesburg, South Africa

of prayer for Mandela

South Africans of
all faiths pray
for Mandela
CAPE TOWN, South Africa
(AP) - In death, Nelson Mandela
unified South Africans of all races
and backgrounds Sunday on a day
of prayer for the global statesman
- from a vaulted cathedral with
hymns and incense to a rural,
hilltop church with goat-skin
drums and barefoot dancing.
Mandela was remembered
in old bedrocks of resistance to
white domination as well as for-
mer bastions of loyalty to apart-
heid.
"May his long walk to freedom
be enjoyed and realized in our
time by all of us," worshippers
said in a prayer at the majestic
St. George's Cathedral in Cape
Town, where the first white
settlers arrived centuries ago
aboard European ships.
South Africa's reflection on

Mandela's astonishing life was a
prelude to a massive memorial in
a Johannesburg stadium Tues-
day that will draw world leaders
and luminaries. They will gather
to mourn, but also to salute the
achievements ofthe prisoner who
became president and an emblem
of humanity's best instincts.
The extended farewell - a
bittersweet mix of grief and cel-
ebration - ends Dec. 15, when
Mandela is to be buried in his
rural hometown of Qunu in East-
ern Cape province.
The anti-apartheid campaign-
er wanted to die in those mod-
est, traditional surroundings;
instead, he died Thursday at age
95 in his home in an exclusive
Johannesburg area. He was sur-
rounded by family after months
of a debilitating illness that
required the constant care of a
team of doctors.
Family friend Bantu Holomisa
told The Associated Press that
Mandela wasn't on life support in
his final hours. He appeared to be

sleeping calmly but it was obvi-
ous that he was finally succumb-
ing, added Holomisa, who said
he saw Mandela about two hours
before his death.
"I've seen people who are on
their last hours and I could sense
that he is now giving up," said
Holomisa, who is the leader of
the United Democratic Move-
ment in parliament.
"You could see it is not Madi-
ba anymore," Holomisa added,
using Mandela's clan name.
The government and Man-
dela's family have revealed few
details about Mandela's death.
Ahmed Kathrada, who was
sentenced to life in prison with
Mandela in 1964, said he was
informed shortly before Mande-
la's death that his old friend had
little time left.
Kathrada said Graca Machel,
Mandela's wife, conveyed the
message to him through another
person that Mandela "will be
leaving us that night" and "the
doctors have said, 'Anytime."'

UPO to infuse Hill
with mystery

New production to
showcase lyricism
of instruments
By GILLIAN JAKAB
DailyArts Writer
The bassoon is perhaps the
most exotic of the traditional
orchestra's instruments, with
its double-
reed delicacy University
and deep Philharmonia
breadth. An
unfinished Orchestra
symphony Monday at
is surely the
most myste- 8p.m.
rious of com- Hill
positions.
Mystery and
intrigue,
added to a classic, century-
old, comic opera performed
with instruments only, yield an
exciting program at the Univer-
sity Philharmonia Orchestra's
semester-closing concert Mon-
day night at Hill Auditorium.
"(Monday's program has) lots
of hummable melodies; lots of
rapturously gorgeous orches-
tration and color, and so it's in
some ways the best way to end
the semester because it features
everybody on the stage creat-
ing so many really beautiful
moments of great music," said
Christopher James Lees, the
conductor of the UPO.
The UPO is made up of 85
students this semester ranging
from freshman to second-year
masters students. They will be
playing three different com-
positions Monday night: Franz

Schubert's Symphony No. 8
"Unfinished," Gioachino Ros-
sini's Concerto for Bassoon &
Orchestra "Concerto da Espe-
rimento" and Richard Strauss's
"Der Rosenkavalier Suite."
An unfinished symphony?
Stories, explanations and
attempts to finish Schubert's
8th have abounded in the wake
of the glory of incompletion.
"There's always that question
of, if he had finished it, what
would it sound like?" Lees said.
"And the music that he did leave
is so kind of profound that it
bears being played even without
the rest of it."
It's common to go to an
orchestral performance and
hear a featured violin or piano,
but bassoon? Not so much.
Associate Professor of Bassoon,
Jeffrey Lyman, will be featured
on the mellifluous woodwind,
often likened to a baritone sing-
ing voice. The UPO gets to work
with different featured profes-
sors for each concert who shake
up the dynamic and bring some-
thing new to the orchestra.
"Jeffrey Lyman is (a) fantas-
tic musician, a consummate art-
ist, incredibly funny and a heck
of a nice guy," Lees said.
The last piece is a suite from
Richard Strauss's opera "Der
Rosenkavalier" - or the "Rose
Knight." It's a comedic story
named after a character who
delivers a silver rose from a
man to his fiance, but upon
delivering the rose, falls in love
with the man's fiance himself.
The tying thread of Monday's
concert is lyricism.
"(Strauss's piece) came from
an opera. Rossini was an opera

composer. Schubert was a song
composer," Lees said. "And yet
we're doing pieces that involve
no voices whatsoever."
They've been doing a lot
of singing in their rehearsals
in an effort to translate the
melodic quality of the vocals
through their instruments.
The music is sure to be beau-
tiful, but will compositions
from hundreds of years ago res-
onate with the audience today?
When works of art last for so
long, it's usually because they
capture some universal human
sentiment that is timeless in its
relevance. As for its freshness,
leave that to the UPO.
"One of the things I like
to say about the creation of
music," Lees said, "is that we
should strive to make new
music sound old and old music
sound new. So if it's fresh it
sounds tried, and true and vet-
ted. And if it's old that it sounds
alive and like you're creating
it for the first time during the
performance. And that's the
quality of performance we go
after."
Just like the student body of
the University, the musicians
of the UPO come from diverse
backgrounds and experiences.
When they play together on the
stage of a Hill Auditorium - a
venue with a hundred years
of history that has seen some
of the greatest artists in the
world - the whole is more than
a sum of its parts. Under the
direction of Lees, the UPO is at
once presenting the history of
western music, and its future,
while making it their own in the
moment.

"We want you to know that
we understand your pain," the
statement read. "We realize
that all you've grown to know
is destruction and that you see
no way out. This is precisely
why we are here. Our work is
not about tangible 'things,' it is
about the Power of the Human
Spirit. We recognize that there

us now. Instead, we invite you
to join our family in creating a
better neighborhood, a better

than for yourself."
The message, however, was
not well received by the arson-
ist, who proceeded to burn
down the last two houses. The
community is upping volunteer
patrols and police surveillance
in hopes of protecting this com-
munity pillar, as well as the
residents in the area who are
threatened by the fires.
In lieu of the recent destruc-

one cannot help but wonder
what the future holds for urban
art. The beautification of urban
decay into nationally recog-
nized art installments, no mat-
ter how untraditional the art
form, shouldn't be grounds for
disembodiment. More destruc-
tion cannot be the response to
revival, or else all progress will
be negated, as though taking
one step forward and two steps
back.
Fulfilling Detroit's city
motto, The Heidelberg Project
guarantees that it will rise from
the senseless ashes of the last
month, proving yet again that
Detroit's resilience can extin-
guish even the strongest fires of
adversity.

numbers, the
broadcast Available for
networks streaming
have started
to program NBC
live-avents in
order to bring in viewers. NBC's
president Bob Greenblatt is a
fan of musicals, so he decided to
try a live presentation of "The
Sound of Music." What resulted
was three hours of television that
contained a mix of success and
failure: The musical itself caused
some of the problems, but others
came from decisions by the cre-
ative team.
The biggest mistake the pro-
ducers made was casting Carrie
Underwood ("Enchanted") as
Maria Rainer. Underwood is best
known as a country music super-
star, not as an actress, and the
producers took a huge risk cast-
ing her in this role. Musically, it
absolutely paid off. Underwood
sings the hell out of the songs,
especially her first number, "The
Sound of Music." In the dialogue
scenes, however, she truly fails to
register as a character - seem-
ing more focused on remember-
ing her lines than crafting a well
formed role.
Even if Underwood barely reg-
isters as an actress, the produc-
ers surround her with Broadway
and television veterans, enough
so that they were at least able to
make everything else bearable.
The best performance in the
show belongs to Audra McDon-
ald ("Private Practice") as Moth-

TV REVIEW
'Mob City' can't find light in film noir

AMC's new period
piece lives and dies
with tropes
By JOE REINHARD
DailyArts Writer
Part of the appeal of film noir
is that it's instantly recogniz-
able. Audiences know just what
to expect,
mostly thanks C±
to a handful

of dialogue,

exaggerated shootouts and vio-
lence, and usually a Femme
Fatale too. AMC's new period
piece "Mob City" delivers these
things and more. Despite being
obviously modern, it does a
great job capturing the tone of
the classic noir flicks from the
1920s, '30s and '40s. Indeed, it's
so laced in its genre that some-
times it's difficult to separate the
two. Maybe that's a good thing
because, by itself, the show just
doesn't hold up. Separate the
story from the cast and crew's
stylistic choices, and you're left
with a decent tribute to a cher-
ished genre.
That's especially a shame,
because the show had a lot going
for it in the production depart-
ment. Helmed by "The Shaw-

shank Redemption" director
Frank Darabont, who also helped
create the widely successful "The
Walking Dead" on AMC, "Mob

of creative investment and con-
trol onboard. The show is based
on the true events of John Bun-
tin's book "L.A. Noir: The Strug-
gle for the Soul of America's Most
Seductive City," which details a
long-lasting struggle between the
Los Angeles Police Department

and the city's organized crime.
"Mob City" tracks their conflict
and spends a good amount of time
with both sides.
Standing in the middle is
Marine-turned-police officer
Joe Teague (Joe Bernthal, "The
Walking Dead"). So far, he plays
each side, working a delicate bal-
ancing act between the good guys
and the bad guys, or "the white
hats" and "the black hats," as he
calls them. Basically, he's the

troubled anti-hero characteristic
of notonlythe noir genre, but a lot
of recent TV programs. ("Break-
ing Bad," "House of Cards" and
"Dexter," to name a few.)
Unfortunately, Joe Teague
doesn't stand out from that pack.
When "Mob City" borrows from
noir elements that are distinct
to the genre - like with its cam-
erawork and lighting - then the
results tend to be fantastic. But
when the show plays around with
other elements, elements that
aren't so unique anymore (such
as a morally ambiguous protago-
nist) then it falls short. Teague
isn't particularly poorly written,
and Bernthal delivers a solid per-
formance, but at this point, his
character is too vague to warrant
much interest. Seeing how we're
already two episodes into a six-
episode season, this proves trou-
bling.
The rest of the cast holds their
own, with no standout perfor-
mances, but a couple of highlights
worth mentioning. Simon Pegg
("Shaun of the Dead") makes an

uncharacteristic guest appear-
ance in episode one, "A Guy
Walks Into a Bar," playing a cyni-
cal comedian named Hecky Nash.
The aforementioned Femme
Fatale also makes an appearance,
in the form of the aptly named
Jasmine Fontaine (Alexa Davalos,
"Angel"). She plays a large role
in episode two, "Reason to Kill
a Man," and her connection to
Teague ends the episode on an
intriguing note.
Regardless, there aren't
enough twists and turns to make
this hour-and-a-half premiere
satisfying. The stock characters
do little to help out. What "Mob
City" does well (its heavily styl-
ized tone) relies too much off of
what it doesn't do well (char-
acters and plot). The former's
meant to complement the latter,
but right now, the tone carries
all of the weight. The show may
have the mobsters, the shadows
and the cigarettes, but it doesn't
have a story with enough sub-
stance to make it especially rec-
ommendable.

in spicy match-
up with K-tState

Senior middle blocker Jennifer Cross was one of five seniors to have their season come to an end against LSU on Friday.

SWolverines eliminate in s

By LIZ VUKELICH
Daily Sports Editor
Last year, it was the Bloomin'
Onion. This year, it's boneless
wings.
The Michigan football team
will conclude its season in
Tempe, Ariz. when it takes on
Kansas State in the Buffalo Wild
Wings Bowl at Sun Devil Stadi-
um on Dec. 28. The game kicks
off at 10:15 p.m. EST.
"We are excited to represent
the Big Ten Conference in the
Buffalo Wild Wings Bowl and to
face a challenging Big 12 Confer-
ence opponent in Kansas State,"
said Michigan coach Brady
Hoke in a statement. "This is a
greatopportunity for Team 134,
and we relish the chance to play
one of college football's most
successful programs.
"Our team is focused on fin-
ishing the season right and
sending our seniors out with a
victory in their last game in a
Michigan uniform."
The Buffalo Wild Wings Bowl
matches up the third selec-
tions from the Big Ten and Big
12. Since the two conferences
started competing in the post-
season game in 2006, the Big 12
leads the series, 5-2. It will be
the first-ever meeting between
Michigan and Kansas State.
The Wolverines haven't
played a bowl game in Arizo-
na since the 1986 Fiesta Bowl,
where they defeated Nebraska.

It will also be just the seventh
time in 42 bowl appearances
that Michigan plays in Decem-
ber.
Though the Wolverines
concluded their season with a
strong showing in a loss against,
Ohio State two weeks ago, they
finished with a 7-5 record, a far
cry from their stated goals of
a Big Ten championship and a
10-win season.
"I don't know if you ever wipe
the season clean," said defensive
coordinator Greg Mattison on
a conference call Sunday eve-
ning. "You emphasize why you
didn't win the game you felt you
should've won and make sure
during these extra bowl practic-
es that you emphasize that and
don't allow it to happen again.
"You get a chance to get so
many more practices. We're a
very young football team, and it
gets our guys another 15 prac-
tices to get better and improve
onthe mistakes thatthey made."
The Wildcats also finished
with a 7-5 record and lost four
conference games, including
Oklahoma State and Baylor.
The Wolverines are 1-1 in
bowl games under Hoke, having
beaten Virginia Tech in the 2012
Sugar Bowl and lost to South
Carolina in last year's Outback
Bowl.
Michigan will begin selling
bowl tickets Monday morning,
with prices ranging from $30-
$100.

the Tigers (19-12).
"It's no question this was a
disappointing loss for us," said
Michigan coach Mark Rosen.
"This team has high goals and
high expectations, and we cer-
tainly are disappointed that we
didn't advance."
Coming off a Cinderella run
to a Final Four appearance a
year ago, a first-round loss is
tough for the Wolverines to
swallow. They returned most of
their starters but struggled to
click as a team.
"It's very easy to fall into
the trap of comparing it to last
year," Cross said. "For us, at
Michigan, culture and family

is everything, so I think that's
kind of why, as a cornerstone
of our program, we struggled if
that wasn't solid."
With the momentum com-
pletely shifted from the start
of the match, Michigan entered
the decisive fifth set fighting to
keep its season alive. But this
year, it was not to be, as LSU

When winning it all doesn't require winning it all

There were big riots in
East Lansing on Satur-
day night, and I couldn't
confirm this, but I think it was in
celebration of my intramural flag
football team's championship the
previous day.
After four years of disappoint-
ment and heartbreak, Team
Globo Gym
finally did it.
Couch burn-
ing, naturally,
was in order.
Either
that, or the
fine citizens
of East Lan-
sing were ZACH
excited HELFAND
about that
other game
this weekend. In fact, these two
teams - these two champions -
sharea similar story.
For years, my No. I goal at
school was to win an intramu-
ral championship. Last year, in
the softball finals, I popped out
with the bases loaded in the last
inning, stranding the winning
run. It has haunted me since.
Michigan State has gone
through a championship
drought, and to a lesser degree,
Michigan has too. I can empa-
thize. It gnaws at your soul.
So as the year started, and
Michigan set its sights on a
Big Ten title, and the Spartan
defense began its dominance, I
set my heart on the flag football
championship. Our quarterback
and coach practiced on the Arch
Street asphalt, perfecting timing
and routes. They watched film on
Drew Brees to imitate his foot-
work and vision. I'm not making
this up.
We were ready, with a roster
refined over the years and sup-
plementedby emergency alter-
nates Nithin - our child-genius
roommate, future doctor and
good sport - and my girlfriend.

the championship, but a champi-
onship was enough.
And that's where these two
stories intersect. I neglected to
mention the game-throwing
scandal that put our Team Globo
Gym in position to win the
championship in the first place.
In our first game of the sea-
son, we lost atight 55-7 game
against the Michigan football
team's managers. The team was
effectively unbeatable. So, like
the smart, industrious college
students we are, we concocted a
plot. We would throw our final
game to ensure a 1-2 record,
sending us to the Men's 'A' con-
solation round, where our path
to immortality and free T-shirts
wouldn't cross that of the man-
agers.
But how to do it? Have Nithin
chug a bottle of Jack Daniels
in the backfield, earninga dis-
qualification? Have Nithin spew
expletives atthe referees until
we were charged with the loss?
Ultimately we just decided to
show up late, but not too late that
we couldn't still play a practice
game. The plan worked, and we
won the T-shirt of course, and
you know what? It felt just as
sweet.
And that's the point. The Big
Ten, at least in the near future, is
stuck in the consolation bracket.
The SEC, like the football man-
agers, remains unbeatable for
now.
Butthere's a reason why
Michigan State didn't care about
any of that, and why Michigan
coach Brady Hoke says the Big
Ten title is his goal. It may be a
consolation, but it doesn't feel
like it.
And more importantly, I
hear the Big Ten champions get
T-shirts, too.

ADAM GLANZMAN/Daily
The Michigan State football team, like Zach Helfand's flag football team, did not win it all. But it did capture a Big Ten Championship and reach the Rose Bowl.

But, this being the Michigan
intramurals, our march to a title
wasn't without controversy.
For Michigan State, the
bad break came in the form of
dubious pass interference calls
against Notre Dame.
For us, it was the age-old
football bugaboo: knitted tassels.
In the playoffs, our quarterback
was sent off for wearing a tas-
seled winter hat. Tassels, appar-
ently, are not allowed in football,
lest the game devolve into anar-
chy. But we survived Tasselgate

and moved on.
We then survived an opening-
round battle against a talented
group of first-year medical stu-
dents. Then we got hot and won
our next two games en route to
the finals, buoyed mostly by a
forfeit, and, critically, a second
forfeit. The finals were so close
we could taste it.
In our way was a rather large
group of grown men, apparently
in the MBA program. Several
had played Division I football.
But, much like Michigan State,

our defense carried us. We won
13-0, our first shutout of the
season.
The T-shirt was ours. I may
have had one or two happier
moments in my life, but if so,
they haven't yet come to mind.
For the moment, I could ignore
the scandal that got us there.
Before we delve into that,
let's rehash that other game
this weekend, involving our
academic neighbors to the north-
west. Remember this game as
that time you, proud Michigan

fan, were really tempted to sing
Michigan State's fight song. By
beating Ohio State in the Big Ten
Championship Game, the Spar-
tans earned atrip to the Rose
Bowl. Also of note: Michigan
State was likely a pass interfer-
ence call against Notre Dame
away from a shot at the national
championship.
That's unfortunate for them,
but, as Sports Illustrated report-
ed from Indianapolis, that mat-
tered approximately not at all in
the moment. They hadn't won

WRESTLING
Michigan places
5th in Las Vegas

By MAX BULTMAN
Daily Sports Writer
Coming off a month of lim-
ited competition, some rust
could have been expected from
the No. 3 Michigan men's swim-
ming team.
Instead, the Wolverines
delivered a series of perfor-
mances worthy of another
national title bid.
As sophomore Dylan Bosch
touched the wall Saturday in
1:41.01 in the 100-yard butterfly,
it became clear that the week-
end would be a memorable one
- not just as a return to form,
but as a meet full of exceptional
performances.
Coming toward the finish on
his final lap, Bosch heard his
teammates erupt in cheers -
the first time he had ever heard
that from inside the water.
When he looked up at the-clock
afterward, he understood why.
Bosch is the defending
national champion in the event
- which he won in 1:41.33 last
March. But that performance
was at the end of the season,
after time-improving tech-
niques like tapering and shav-
ing. Now, in December, the
meaningful part of the season
hasn't even started.
"To see 1:41.01 is just a really
good feeling," Bosch said. "The
hard work we've put in at the
pool is paying off."
It was that kind of weekend
for the team, which won the
AT&T Winter National Cham-
pionships in Knoxville, Tenn.
The Wolverines defeated a
combination of NCAA schools
and U.S. swimming clubs at
Allan Jones Aquatic Center,
competing against college ath-
letes and Olympic gold med-
alists alike. They scored 316
points to claim first place,
ahead of SwimMAC swim club
of North Carolina.
"Any time you step into an
arena where the competition
is raised, you're going to rise
to that competition if you're a
fighter," said Michigan coach
Mike Bottom. "These guys are

of the day belonged to junior
Bruno Ortiz, who had to race
Olympic gold medalists Nathan
Adrian and Matt Grevers in the
50-yard and 100-yard freestyle
events. Ortiz swam his best
times of the season in 19.53 and
43.43, respectively, but couldn't
keep up with Adrian, who won
both events. Ortiz finished 10th
in the 50-yard and 13th in the
100-yard, beating Olympian
Cullen Jones in the longer race.
"They're not just here to
swim against (the Olympians),"
Bottom said. "They're watch-
ing them, they're learning from
them and they're going to be

With so much success this
early in the season, there's
plenty of reason for excitement
on the pool deck. And, as Bosch
and his teammates felt on Sat-
urday, that emotion should fuel
the Wolverines to faster times.
"I felt like every swim we
had someone doing something
pretty amazing," Wynalda said.
"Someone was talking about
watching the live feed, and
they called it the 'Let's Go Blue
Audio Channel.' They couldn't
hear anything other than us
cheering."

Freshman Adam
Coon captures
heavyweight title to
lead the Wolverines
By NATHANIEL CLARK
For the Daily
Most people who go to Las
Vegas return poorer than when
they arrived.
Don't tell that to the Michigan
wrestling team, which didn't win
any money but returned richer for
the experience. The 20th-ranked
Wolverines finished in fifth place
out of 33 teams with a score of
108.5 points at the Cliff Keen
Invitational in Las Vegas. No. 4
Oklahoma placed in first with
154.5 points. Two other Big Ten
teams, No. 10 Nebraska and No. 8
Ohio State, finished ahead of the
Wolverines, coming in second and
third, respectively.
Even though he is too young to
enter a casino, freshman Adam
Coon still drew aces for Michigan.
Coon, who was the eighth seed in
his class, won the heavyweight
championship against second-
seeded J.T. Felix of Boise State,
7-5. Coon rallied from a 4-1 defi-
cit to take the victory, completing
an undefeated weekend with two
pins. He's now a perfect 13-0 on
the season, making him Michi-
gan's onlyundefeated starter.
"He has the will to win," said
Michigan coach Joe McFarland.
"He is aterrific competitor."
While he said it felt good to
win, Coon downplayed the tri-
umph and his perfect record
despite his coach's praise.
"I have to take it one match at
a time," Coon said. "I can't just
think of it like I'm 13-0, I have to
just focus on the next match and
do everythingI can to win."
But it wasn't just Coon who
came up big for the Wolver-
ines. Freshman Brian Murphy
advanced to the semifinals in
the 157-pound division in his
first-ever varsity meet, defeating

Spencer Hill of Cal State Bakers-
field, No. 4 Andy McCulley of
Wyoming in a sudden victory and
No. 5 Max Schneider of Cal Poly.
Murphy was finally defeated in a.
close match by No.1 James Green
of Nebraska, 7-5, in a sudden vic-
tory that came on a controversial
locked-hand call.
Sophomore Eric Grajales made
it to the semifinals for the 149-
pound weight class as the No. 3
seed. He won by sticking Adrian
Avelar of Western Wyoming and
Jeremy Golding of North Idaho,
11-3, before losing a competitive
match to No. 2 Jake Suflohn of
Nebraska, 7-6.
Fifth-year senior Dan Yates
had a particularly impressive.
performance for Michigan. As
the third seed, he advanced to
the semifinals in the 165-pound
weight class. Yates was put into a
deep half by No. 5 Cooper Moore
of Northern Iowa in the third-
place wrestleback match, but
Yates foughtbackto stick Moore.
"Danny showed a ton of heart
today," McFarland said. "He got
off his back and kept fighting."
.McFarland was happy with
the way his young wrestlers per-
formed in Las Vegas. He also
likes how captain Max Huntley
and the seniors have been lead-
ing the young teammates. McFar-
land said that his upperclassmen
are the glue that keeps the whole
squad together.
"The seniors are really mesh-
ing well with the young guys,"
McFarland said. "This was a very
competitive weekend, and our
guys showed greatcharacter."
Things do not get any easier
for the Wolverines. Nine of the 12
teams in the Big Ten are ranked
in the top 10, and Michigan will
wrestle individually against
seven of them this season. Michi-
gan also will face a tough Central
Michigan team next Sunday.
"The Big Ten is the power
conference in NCAA wrestling
this year," McFarland said. "But
our guys are really excited to see
where they stack up against the
rest of the Big Ten."

"He shot pretty well from 3,
eh?"
More than a half hour after
the Michigan men's basketball
team finished its blowout win
over Houston Baptist, 107-53, a
group of 60 of sophomore guard
Nik Stauskas's family, friends
and neighbors congregated in
the Crisler Center concourse.
In thick Canadian accents,
those from his hometown spoke
giddily of Stauskas's dominant
shooting performance.
Thanks to buses organized
by Stauskas's parents, the group
made the four-plus-hour bus
trip from Mississauga, Ont. to
Ann Arbor. For many, it was the
first time watching the guard
play in person.
Stauskas knew he had to
put on a show for them. With
the help of his teammates, his
guests should've felt right at
home from their upper-bowl
seats as they watched a con-
tinuous party from beyond the
arc - one not all that different
from what they're used to see-
ing in Stauskas' backyard.
Led by the sophomore's
game-high 25 points on 6-of-9
shooting from 3-point range,
the Wolverines shot a season-
best 16-for-26 from 3, good for
61.5 percent.
"I didn't expect that kind
of shooting, although we are
a good shooting team," said
Michigan coach John Beilein.
Michigan connected on
10-of-16 from deep in the first
half before cooling off - by just
2.5 percent -

Sophomore forward Nik Stauskus tied a career high with six 3-pointers.

Senior middle blocker Jennifer
Cross thought about the differ-
ence between last year, the vol-
leyball program's first Final Four,
and this year, an unexpected
flameout in the first round of the
NCAA Tournament.
She thought about the close
wins Michigan had last year en
route to the national semifinal,
and the close losses it suffered
this year. She thought about the
two 3-2 defeats to Illinois and
all the other matches that could
have defined the Wolverines but
didn't. She thought about what
was different.
"Well, if we knew..." Cross said,
"we would apply it."
Friday, Michigan showed hints
of the power it could have shown
all year long, closing out a first-
set win over LSU, 25-23, and then
hammering the Lady Tigers in
the second set, 25-9. The Wolver-
ines headed to the locker room
with a comfortable lead and
thought that maybe, just maybe,
it would be the match that turned
their season around.
In a way, the LSU match rep-
resented the whole season. The
Wolverines started the year 10-1,
winning two tournaments. But
their success was short-lived.
"We just struggled finding our
identity as a team," Cross said.
"Our fault at the end is that we
VOLLEYBALL
From Page 1B
The Wolverines took control
early with a hard-fought 25-23
victory in the first set. In a high-
ly competitive set, the score was
tied on 12 different occasions,
and neither team led by more
than three.
Cross posted six kills and a
block in the first set, helping her
team overcome three key service
errors. Senior Ally Sabol led a
persistent defense, starting her
fifth consecutive game at libero
in place of sophomore Tiffany
Morales, who was not complete-
ly healthy and spent most of the
match rotating in as a defensive
specialist. Cross finished off the
first set by earning four of her
team's final five points to seal the
victory.
Energized by the victory, the
Wolverines stormed out and
dominated the second set. After
jumping out to a 6-1 lead to

"It's getting there," he said.
"It's not even really hurting

By taking away Stauskas,
Duke essentially stymied the
entire Wolverine offense.
Watching highlight film, the
Michigan coaches weren't
happy with the offense's spac-
ing - a developing pattern from
other losses, namely the one at
Iowa State.
"I think in the Duke game,
there were times where our
spacing was horrible so, we
definitely worked at that a lot in
practice," Stauskas said. "I was
glad that we could see that out
there in the game."
But the team's pinpoint
shooting was a far cry from
what Beilein saw in Friday's
preparation for Saturday.
Working against a variety of
defensive sets, Michigan strug-
gled to shoot the ball in prac-
tice.
"I bet you we went 3-for-20
from 3, and the whole idea was
just keep shooting and ifyou get
open looks, knock them down,"
Beilein said. "We certainly had
that opportunity again today
and we made the most of it."

come, and Michigan took the
second set, 25-9 - one of its larg-
est margins of victory all season.
The blocking game was espe-
cially strong for the Wolverines
in the second set. Cross and Toon
each had three blocks in the set,
while sophomore outside hitters
Krystalyn Goode and Ally Davis,
junior setter Lexi Dannemiller
and freshman middle blocker
Abby Cole also joined in on sev-
eral tandem blocks.
Michigan looked like a team
destined for a date with No. 3
Washington in the second round.
Then, suddenly, the wheels fell
off.
Everything that went well
for Michigan in the second set
went horribly wrong in the third.
The Wolverines only managed
one block and committed seven
errors. LSU went on a 4-0 run to
begin the set and never looked
back.
The Lady Tigers rode the
strength of an 8-0 run in the
middle of the set to gain an.18-7
lead before ultimately winning
25-14.
"They served us short a lot
more, and that kind of threw our
rhythm off a little bit," Rosen

said. "We adjusted later, but by
then our ball control was strug-
gling a little bit, and we weren't
able to stay in system."
Rosen also acknowledged a
sudden decline in the Wolver-
ines' defense coming off their
dominant second set.
To remedy the situation,
Rosen sent Morales out in the
libero jersey to start the fourth
set.
Though Morales had a pro-
ductive match - she led the team
with 20 digs - the Wolverines
still couldn't close out the Lady
Tigers.
A 6-0 LSU run in the fourth
set broke a 6-6 tie. The Wolver-
ines' offensive struggles dictat-
ed the set, as they committed a
match-high eight errors. Michi-
gan couldn't capitalize on a late
rally and ultimately dropped the
set 25-19.
Michigan finished with nine
fewer wins than last season
despite being ranked No. 7 at the
start of the season. It was the
final match for seniors Cross,
Toon and Sabol, as well as fifth-
year senior defensive specialist
Brittany Lee and senior outside
hitter Lexi Erwin.

The Michigan Daily - michigandaily.com

JRL Q,

MONEY
From Page 1B
er adds roughly $5.5 million in
direct revenues each year.
For a star player like former
Michigan quarterback Denard
Robinson, Texas A&M's Johnny
Manziel or, to a lesser degree,
Gardner, that figure can climb
much higher.
"At that extreme level, you
can't even say how much," said
Lawrence Kahn, a professor of
economics at Cornell Univeristy,
referring to players like Robin-
son or Manziel. "All you can say is
he's, I'm sure, way more valuable
that the average NFL draftable
player."
That is likelytrue of most quar-
terbacks who play at Michigan, a
schoolthat typically creates NFL-
caliber players at the position that
often become the face of the pro-
gram.
"You take Gardner, and you put
him at Utah State,he's notgoingto
generate the revenues obviously
that he will at Michigan," Brown
said.
For Gardner, the current
quarterback, the conservative
$5.5-million estimate puts his
value to the program at $16.5 mil-
lion over a three-year career as a
scarcer.
The players do receive com-
pensation, including scholar-
ships, apparel, travel, training and
meals. According to the Knight
Commission, Michigan spent
$273,863 on each scholarship foot-
ball player in 2011, ninth most in
the nation. For comparison, that's
more than 10 times the $26,345 it
averages in academic spending for
all students.
But James Duderstadt, Univer-
sity president from 1988 to 1996,
says that figure is inflated by fac-
tors other than direct spending on
athletes.
"The fallacy on that is that, in
fact, the ($273,863) that is spenton
each student is primarily spent on
coaches and staff salaries," Dud-
erstadt said. In 2011, Michigan
spent $8.76 million on salaries for
coaches, support staff and admin-
istration.
The athletes, he said, are "the

people that are generating the
wealth, but the wealth is going to
athletic directors, coaches, con-
ference commissioners. None of
it, I would add, really goes to the
universities."
IN EXPOSURE VALUE, MORE
VALUES
The study's $5.5-million
annual figure includes direct rev-
enue sources such as television
revenues and ticket sales. But it
ignores indirect sources like jer-
sey sales and media exposure.
Jersey sales receive the bulk
of the attention, but for universi-
ties, they account for a tiny frac-
tion of total revenues. Even with
Manziel, the most attention grab-
bing in the country, Texas A&M
earned just $59,690 on all jersey
sales for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 2013, according to ESPN.
Jersey sales account for 1.1 per-
cent of licensing revenue, accord-
ing to the Collegiate Licensing
Company.
Most teams, like Texas A&M,
take 10 percent of the wholesale
cost in royalties. Michigan takes
12 percent. Jersey sales are lucra-
tive for the manufacturers and
retailers, but not for the schools
themselves.
The real money comes from
the freeradvertising generated by
players like Gardner. To estimate
the value of Gardner's exposure,
the Daily commissioned analysis
from the Ann Arbor-based Joyce
Julius and Associates, a research
firm that specializes in measuring
and evaluating corporate spon-
sorships. The company looked at
Gardner's media exposure on tele-
vision, print and online for August
- a month with just one game -
and September.
"We're basically saying, 'OK,
how many people saw or hear
the message or heard the article
or story' of whatever the topic
was that we were monitoring,"
said Eric Schwartz, president and
executive director of research
of Joyce Julius and Associates.
"Say Devin was mentioned on
SportsCenter, we would value
that mention based on the number
of folks that were watching that
particular broadcast."

In other words, the company
determined how many people
each piece of media reached, and
evaluated how much money the
University would otherwise have
to spend to reach a similar-sized
audience.
The results revealed an enter-
prise even more profitable than
on-field revenues. In the two
months analyzed, Gardner was

mentioned or appeared in an arti-
tle 7,565 times, reaching an audi-
ence of 702 million people. That
was worth $15.6 million in free
advertising in just two months,
for a team that struggled early on.
Of the media exposure, a major-
ity of the value - $11.7 million -
came from Internet news sources.
Another $2.4 million came from
print media and $1.5 million from

television news.
Most of the value came during
the month of September - about
$11 million compared to the $4.5
million in August.
Of course, NCAA rules pro-
hibit any monetary compensation
and puts restrictions on transfers
and other forms of compensation.
Economists, including Brown,
describe the NCAA as a cartel

operating in whatthey call a mon-
opsony - one buyer for labor but
many sellers.
"Because they restrict the pay,
there's exploitation," Brown said.
"Players are worth more than the
compensation they receive. That's
the bottom line."
