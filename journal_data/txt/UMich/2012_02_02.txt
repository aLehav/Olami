National Signing Day

Wolverines finish
with fourth-ranked
recruiting class
By STEPHEN J. NESBITT
Daily Sports Editor
Brady Hoke and the Michi-
gan football coaching staff
eased into their seats in the war
room at Schembechler Hall and

waited. It was 7 a.m. yesterday -
National Signing Day.
Fourteen minutes later, the
first Letter of Intent printed out
on the fax machine down the
hall. It was a sigh of relief for
the staff completing its first full
recruiting class at Michigan.
By noon, the last of the Wol-
verines' 25 incoming freshmen
faxed in his paperwork, filling
the board. Scout.com tabbed
Michigan as the No. 4 recruiting

class in the nation.
"I know none of you will ask
the question, 'Is this a good
class?' " Hoke joked at the
National Signing Day press con-
ference. "Because it is. We don't
try to recruit bad classes.
"Hoping to save you some
embarrassment."
Hoke gave a weary grin. It
had been an early morning.
The biggest surprise of the
day came long before the coach-

ing staff made its way to Schem-
bechler Hall. In the wee hours
of the morning, the Wolverines
secured a surprise commitment
from Dennis Norfleet, a four-
star running back from Detroit,
to round out the class.
Norfleet's offer came late,

After discovering her passion for
food during a stint abroad in Flor-

own bakeshop in Ann Arbor - Sweet

Leavitt said her cultural anthro-

about different cultures and people.
Pairing her time in Italy with her
knowledge of art and affinity for
sculpture, Leavitt developed her
arts thesis by creating a series of
edible monuments to highlight food
producers and artisans in the Ann
Arbor area. The project eventually
blossomed into her current business.
"It was really easy to combine my

New drug helps alleviate

By K.C. WASSMAN
Daily StaffReporter
The city of Ann Arbor -
also known as Tree Town
- has been widely recog-
nized for its environmental
and sustainable practices.
However, these awards rep-
resent just the beginning
of Ann Arbor's sustainabil-
ity efforts, according to city
officials.
In an effort to make the
city more environmentally-
friendly, a four-part Sus-
tainable Ann Arbor forum
series was launched ear-
lier this year. An energy
financing program called
Property Assess Clean
Energy was implemented
last fall. The series, which
held its first community

District Library earlier this
month, is meant to facilitate
public discussion on four
sustainability themes -
resource management, land
use and access, climate and
energy and community.
The meetings have
had large turnouts thus
far, more than 100 people

Gingrich, Santorum
vow to push forward
after Florida defeat
ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) - The
race for the GOP presidential
nomination probably is far from
over.
Front-runner Mitt Romney's
rivals - chief among them Newt
Gingrich - are refusing to bow
out despite his resoundingFlori-
da victory. New rules for award-
ing delegates to this summer's
Republican nominating conven-
tion give even losing candidates
little incentive to drop out.
And so-called "super" political
action committees have proven
they can keep even the most
cash-strapped campaigns alive
by accepting unlimited dona-
tions from individuals to run
ads on their behalf.
"All of them have earned the
opportunity to keep going,"
said David Azbell, an Alabama
Republican consultant said of
the candidates. "We're only
four primaries in for goodness
sake."
Indeed, some 46 states have
yet to vote and only 6 percent of
the delegates have been won.
"I understand that people are

concerned about how long the
primary process is dragging out,"
House Speaker John Boehner,
R-Ohio, said yesterday. "I think
everybody just needs to realize
that this will resolve itself."
His assurances aside, the
likelihood that the primary
will stretch into the spring or
beyond has some Republicans
fretting about their eventual
nominee emerging battered and
broke, only to have little time to
prepare for what promises to be
an intense fall campaign against
President Barack Obama.
"Dealing with the residue of
a very tough primary battle can
be a difficult problem," acknowl-
edged former New Hampshire
Gov. John Sununu.
Others, Romney included, are
defending a protracted nomi-
nating fight as a test of strength,
even though a long battle risks
tearing an already fractured
GOP even further apart.
"We are looking for a full-
spectrum conservative, sub-
stantively and politically skilled
- not possible to discern in a
couple of contests," said Mary
Matalin, a veteran GOP presi-
dential campaign operative.
But she added: "A possible
concern of protraction is not
duration but acrimony." She

recalled the fight between
Republicans Gerald Ford and
Ronald Reagan in 1976, when
Democrat Jimmy Carter won
and said: "That one was ideolog-
ical. This one is personal."
Former Rep. Asa Hutchin-
son of Arkansas said Romney's
Florida victory makes clear
"that he's going to be the likely
nominee. Yet, Hutchinson also
downplayed the notion that
a protracted fight would aide
Democrats, saying: "Only if (the
Republican contest) is a negative
campaign does it benefit them."
Said Azbell: "We're kind of in
a Catch-22 situation. We don't
want to be hurt by a long prima-
ry but we also don't want to be
stuck with a nominee that the
public cannot coalesce behind."
In his victory speech Tuesday
night, Romney sought to turn
his bitterly personal fight with
Gingrich into a positive light,
even as he all but urged the GOP
to rally behind his candidacy.
"A competitive primary
does not divide us, it prepares
us," Romney told supporters
in Tampa, Fla. "And when we
gather here in Tampa seven
months from now for our con-
vention, ours will be wwa unit-
ed party with a winning ticket
for America."

DETROIT
Chrysler posts
first annual net
profit since 1997
Higher sales of Jeeps and
other new vehicles propelled
Chrysler to its first annual net
income since 1997, capping a
pivotal turnaround that many
thought would never happen.
The U.S. automaker, now pri-
vately held and majority owned
by Italy's Fiat SpA, earned $183
million last year, reversing a
$652 million loss in 2010, its
first full year out of bankruptcy
protection.
Just three years ago Chrys-
ler was close to running out of
cash and heading for the auc-
tion house. But a government-
funded bankruptcy cut debt
and expenses, and Chrysler
spent last year rolling out 16
new or revamped models to
boost sales. Now the company
is expanding into small cars
and adding jobs.
Chrysler expects an even
better 2012, despite a sluggish
and uncertain economy. The
company, which sells most of
its vehicles in the U.S., predicts
it will make about $1.5 billion
this year and increase revenue
18 percent.

An investigation of a major

estate and 10 vehicles, including
a Rolls Royce and Bentleys, fed-
eral authorities said yesterday.
An indictment unsealed in
federal court charged 12 people,
including a former state law-
maker.

Indiana gov. signs

Indiana is the first Rust Belt
state to enact the contentious
right-to-work labor law prohibit-
ing labor contracts that require
workers to pay union representa-

Mitch Daniels signed the bill
yesterday.
The Senate approved the mea-
sure a few hours earlier yester-
day, following weeks of discord
that saw House Democrats boy-
cott the Legislature and thou-
sands of protesters gather at the
Statehouse.
"Seven years of evidence and
experience ultimately demon-

strated that Indiana did need a
right-to-work law to capture jobs
for which, despite our highly
rated business climate, we are
not currently being considered,"
Daniels said in a statement. A
spokeswoman said he would not
take questions on the measure
 yesterday.

Forces to remain in
advisory, training
role until 2014
BRUSSELS (AP) - Defense
Secretary Leon Panetta laid
out the administration's most
explicit portrayal of the U.S.
drawdown in Afghanistan, say-
ing yesterday that U.S. and other
international forces in Afghani-
stan expect to end their com-
bat role in 2013 and continue a
training and advisory role with
Afghan forces through 2014.
Panetta's remarks to reporters
traveling with him to a NATO
defense ministers meeting in
Brussels showed how the foreign
military role in Afghanistan is
expected to evolve from the cur-
rent high-intensity fight against
the Taliban to a support role with
Afghans fully in the lead. The
timeline fits neatly into the U.S.
political calendar, enabling Pres-
ident Barack Obama to declare
on the campaign trail this year
that in addition to bringing all
U.S. troops home from Iraq and
beginning a troop drawdown in
Afghanistan, he also has a target
period for ending the U.S. com-
bat role there.
It also serves to possibly
bridge an apparent gap between

France and the rest of the NATO
partners of the U.S. on defining
the end game in Afghanistan.
All NATO members in
November 2010 endorsed a plan
to keep forces in Afghanistan
until the end of 2014. But France
this week appeared to throw
that plan into doubt when Presi-
dent Nicolas Sarkozy proposed,
with Afghan President Hamid
Karzai at his side and seemingly
in agreement, that NATO end its
mission in 2013 - one year ear-
lier than planned.
Sarkozy also said, however,
that France would provide sup-
port for the training of Afghan
forces beyond 2013, so his
approach might not be entirely
different from the one Panetta
outlined in which allied troops
shed their combat role in the
second half of 2013 but remain
through 2014 to train, advise
and assist.
Panetta said he hoped to
hear more from the French del-
egation at the NATO talks today
and tomorrow.
Panetta called 2013 a critical
year for the Afghanistan mis-
sion that has dragged on for
more than a decade with little
sign that the Taliban will be
decisively defeated. He noted
that NATO and the Afghan gov-
ernment intend to begin a final

phase of handing off sections of
the country to Afghan security
control in mid-2013.
"Hopefully by the mid to lat-
ter part of 2013 we'll be able to
make a transition from a com-
bat role to a training, advise and
assist role," he said. He added
that this "doesn't mean we're
not going to be combat-ready,"
but rather that the U.S. and
other international forces will
no longer be in "the formal com-
bat role we're in now."
Panetta said the administra-
tion wants to make sure that
the Afghan forces, after foreign
troops depart, are "sufficient
and sustainable," but noted
that will require continuing
financial support not only from
the United States but also from
allies and many other countries.
"One of the things we'll be
discussing (in Brussels) is what
the size of that (Afghan) force
should be, but a lot of that will
be dependent on the funds that
are going to be put on the table
in order to sustain that force,"
he said. "That's one of the
things, frankly, I'm going to be
pushing at this (meeting)."

Rose said that putting the

Assange takes extraditio
the Great Britain Supren

Wikileaks founder's
last chance to avoid
going to Sweden
LONDON (AP) - Julian
Assange took his extradition
battle to Britain's Supreme
Court yesterday, arguing that
sending him to Sweden would
violate age-old legal tradition.
The two-day hearing is
Assange's last chance to per-
suade British judges to quash
efforts to send him to Scandi-
navia, where he is wanted on
sex crimes allegations. The case
will continue Thursday, but no
decision is expected for several
weeks.
Assange - who leads the
WikiLeaks anti-secrecy web-
site - was accused of rape, coer-
cion and molestation following
encounters with two Swedish
women in August 2010, shortly
after his group published sensi-
tive U.S. government documents
relating to the Afghan war.

He denies the allegations,
claiming the sex was consen-
sual.
Assange's case before the
Supreme Court hinges on a sin-
gle technicality: whether Swe-
den's public prosecutor could
issue a warrant for Assange's
arrest.
In Britain as in the United
States, generally only judges
can issue arrest warrants, and
U.K. courts only honor Euro-
pean arrest warrants issued by
what they describe as judicial
authorities.
The warrant seeking
Assange's arrest was issued by
Sweden's public prosecutor, but
British courts have so far upheld
it on the grounds that Swedish
prosecutors, like some of their
European counterparts, play a
quasi-judicial role.
Assange lawyer Dinah Rose
blasted that argument Wednes-
day, telling the seven justices

Detroit needs to carefully consider drastic cuts
Detroit has once again been forced to make budget cuts, and
this time the fat-trimming is expected to occur within the
week. Last Monday, the Detroit City Council convened to
discuss the city's finances, one week before Republican Gov. Rick Sny-
der's deadline for the city to make budget cuts. In a desperate effort
to avoid being given an emergency financial manager by the state, the
council is looking to privatize services like ambulances, close recre-
ation facilities, increase bus fare and garbage collection fees and merge
its health department with Wayne County's. One week to make cuts
to a city that's been hurting for decades is unreasonable and likely to
hurt most residents. While cuts are necessary, it is essential that this
deadline be extended in order to allow for careful, reasonable deci-
sions that lessen adverse effects on Detroit residents.

Ingenuity of creativity

acebook, Twitter and Google
- these are some of today's
hottest companies that
started off as
ideas; not ideas
planted in your
head by Leon- -
ardo DiCaprio,
but ideas that s
arose from the
culmination of
intelligence, an JASON
open-minded PANG JAO
environment
and polychro-
matic experi-
ences. A sparkle of an idea, or even
a resemblance of an idea inflames,
the rest of one's neurological and
musculoskeletal systems and wires
this person in front of a desk until
the flares turn into a volcanic rup-
ture that gives birth to a multi-bil-
lion dollar company.
An idea is what enables us to
create new blockbuster products,
find cures to diseases and institute
social change. In order for an idea
to survive, we have to foster it with
the right resources and not let the
surroundings of its bearer crush
that idea. Governments have the
responsibility to provide a suitable
environment for creativity, and if
they cannot accomplish this goal,
it is our responsibility, the respon-
sibility of the people, to tell them,
"We want change!"
In Europe, a dearth of innova-
tion has brought some of the once
mightiest nations down to the brink
of bankruptcy. The PIGS countries,
Portugal, Italy, Greece and Spain,
gained notoriety as the center of
attention during the European sov-
ereign debt crisis. Creditratingagen-
cies Standard and Poor's, Moody's
Investors Service and Fitch Group
recently downgraded the credit-
worthiness of PIGS. With the added
apparent risk, investors demand
even higher interest rates for hold-
ing bonds issued by PIGS, rendering

it more difficult and expensive for
these nations to raise funds.
As the debt' crisis drags on,
industry experts ask, "Why is this
happening?" Many conclude that
it's the political corruption, the
inept fiscal policies and tax evasion
that led to today's quandary. Now,
with new data from University of
Toronto's Rotman School of Man-
agement, I can confidently say that
a lack of investment in Research &
Development and other innovative
activities are a major potential cul-
prit for the crisis.
PIGS, both in the public and pri-
vate sectors, each spent between
0.58 percent (Greece) and 1.51 per-
cent (Portugal) in R&D activities
as a percentage of GDP in 2008,
which lagged significantly behind
the averages of the European Union
(1.9 percent), the United States (2.76
percent) and Japan (3.44 percent).
According to the Global Creativity
Index Report of 2011, which mea-
sures a country's technology, tal-
ent and tolerance levels (the 3Ts),
the PIGS nations lag in at least two
of the three metrics. For example,
Greece ranked ninth out of 82 in
the education and creative class but
lacked the tolerant environment and
technological infrastructure needed
for retaining its talent. Spain ranked
sixthout of81for tolerance ofminor-
ities and LGBTQ members in its
communitybuttrailed intechnology
and talent. When compared with the
per-capita GDP of countries, GCI
shows a correlation of 0.82, indicat-
ing a strong link between creativity
and economic prosperity.
The United States, which ranks
second in GCI behind Sweden, has
the world's highest GDP. But with
industry-driven economies like
those of China and India shifting
employment opportunities abroad,
we must look for ways to catalyze
the growth of our economy if we
wish to harbor and improve upon
our success story.

. In his speech in Ann Arbor last
Friday, President Barack Obama said
he wished to bring back the manu-
facturing jobs from abroad. With all
due respect, I think we ought to stop
thinking about what we can take
back and focus on what we can make
anew. Iamspeakingaboutnewentre-
preneurial start-ups like Facebook

for jobs so great that the free market
and its constituents will have to hire
domestically. The Obama adminis-
tration and Congress should seek
ways to further this cause, includ-
ing the establishment of a long-term
R&D tax incentive plan, the creation
of a bureaucracy-free business land-
scape thatpromotes small businesses
and start-ups, and scholarships that
reward students based on their cre-
ative and problem-solvingskills.
Obama said University students
know how to "make" things. We
damn right know how to "make"
things - from world-class solar cars
to renowned search engines, from
fissionable materials to informa-
tion theory. I am proud to say that
we have one of the most formidable
student bodies in terms of talents and
enthusiasm. We have all the will and
the right ideas. The question is, is
America ready to listen?

Though Detroit Mayor Dave Bing is count-
ing on substantial savings through conces-
sions with unions, City Council is not so
confident. It's likely that Bing's current pro-
posed plan will only reduce the city's budget
by $44 million - far short of the $102 mil-
lion necessary to avoid an emergency man-
ager. However, the City Council's job is to
respond to its residents' needs, not to virtu-
ally disappear for the sake of reaching bud-
get cuts. On Monday, Council President Pro
Tem Gary Brown justified the hastiness of
the belt-tightening and affirmed that Detroit
is "really out of time."
It's certainly true that budget cuts need to
happen quickly in order to avoid the appoint-
ment of an emergency manager who is fiscal-
ly in charge of the city. However, the budget
should not shave off essential services like
garbage pick-up to residents nor should it
employ lay-offs, of which another 1,300 may
occur. There are other ways of implement-
ing budget cuts, like bringing back the State
Revenue Sharing Program. This program
redistributes sales tax collected in the state

to local governments. A program like this
would not only benefit Detroit now, but could
also help other distressed cities in the future.
If cuts are not implemented, Snyder will
appoint an emergency financial manager
for Detroit or will form a consent agreement
that would involve shared fiscal responsibil-
ity with city officials. However, the proposed
partnership has also been met with opposi-
tion. Since the mayor and council would
essentially be given the ability to institute
fast-track changes in how the city is run -
such as changing administration details or
privatizing city services, it seems that the
option only differs from that of the emergen-
cy manager in its bureaucratic makeup. Both
the City Council and an emergency financial
manager would have the power to greatly
impact the lives of Detroiters.
Impulsive decisions that focus only on the
short-term can become huge problems in the
long run. The Detroit City Council, Bing and
Snyder should all look for ways to extend the
deadline and come up with solutions that are
minimally harmful to Detroit's residents.

Numbers can lie

JOSEPH VARILONE I
SAFE supports humanrights

In the Jan. 23 article "Viewpoint: Engage
in Productive Discourse," Students Allied for
Freedom and Equality, a student organization
dedicated to the liberation and self-determi-
nation of the Palestinian people, was unfairly
slandered by its author Max Heller, who inap-
propriately insinuated false things about SAFE
as an organization and what we stand for. Hell-
er's accusation of SAFE propagating myths is
directly contrary to the first-hand experiences
and testimonies of the Palestinians themselves,
and his historical analysis is predicated on
colonialist assumptions.
Heller contends that it is "dishonest to claim
the Israeli government is racist and expelling
Israeli Arabs from their homes." This is what
made the Jewish state of Israel possible - the
1948 expulsion of more than 700,000 Pales-
tinians from their homes during what Pales-
tinians refer to as al-Nakba (the catastrophe).
To this day, expelled Israeli Arabs continue to
speak up about this reality. Perhaps more egre-
gious is that Israel and the Jewish National
Fund attempt to erase the record of al-Nakba
by planting trees over the sites of old Palestin-
ian villages. It's nothing more than a falsehood
to claim that Palestinians were given a chance
to live peacefully within Israeli borders. A
quick look through the writings of David Ben-
Gurion, Israel's first prime minister, reveals
that his plans were nothing less than the com-
plete ethnic cleansing and expulsion of Pales-
tinians from their land to create a Jewish state.
That's precisely what he did.
Heller's historical summary and analysis are
predicated on the assumption that Jews were
entitled to their own state in the land of Pales-
tine, and since Palestinians were denying them
this privilege, they deserved what they got.
But why would anyone allow a foreign people
to take ownership of their land and establish
a state in which the indigenous people were
not welcome? This is the reality: Israel, like
the United States, is a nation founded upon
colonialists and oppression. It is founded
upon the killing and expulsion of indigenous
peoples from their lands. It is founded upon
entitlement, privilege, supremacy and ethnic
cleansing. The Palestinians were never morally
obliged to give Jews any of their land, just as
the Potawatomi, Tolowa and the Lakota were
never morally obliged to give up their land to
European colonialism. All future peacemaking
attempts must be viewed in this light. Israel
has always failed to recognize of Nakba and
the Palestinian right of return to their lands

that were stolen. This implies that what Israel
defends as necessary for national security is in
reality its way of maintaining hegemony, colo-
nialism and dominance in the region.
SAFE stands for human rights. We not only
oppose Israeli colonialism and racism, but also
the oppression of other people, wherever it may
manifest itself. We don't condone violence and
we condemn anti-Semitism, but Heller inap-
propriately insinuates the contrary when he
refers to Hamas and Fatah as terrorist organi-
zations and subsequently questions our claim
that we do not support or affiliate with them.
We strongly affirm our statement that we do
not officially support any political party, be it
American, Israeli or Palestinian. This distracts
discourse and resistance from the root causes
of Palestinian oppression. Heller implies that
since Palestinians have elected these parties
to power, they have no right to self-determi-
nation. But this is akin to saying that since the
Democrats and Republicans are both incompe-
tent, in my own opinion, the American people
do not have the right to self-determination.
What if Palestinians aren't fond of either Fatah
or Hamas, but view one of them as the lesser
of two evils? Does this sound familiar? All
peoples have the right to self-determination.
If Israel is so democratic, then why do they
oppose the right of the Palestinian people to
determine their own future?
Israel's supporters consistently oppose
so-called unilateral Palestinian acts of resis-
tance and self-determination, as they did dur-
ing the Palestinians' UN statehood bid last
fall, and this is reflected in Heller's response
to SAFE's walkout of Israeli politician Ish-
mael Khaldi. Supporters of Israel consistent-
ly oppose any form of Palestinian resistance
that they do not have complete control over,
such as the statehood bid, walkout protests
and humanitarian flotillas. They only sup-
port dialogue, which has failed to achieve
Israeli recognition of the Palestinian right
of return. As stated in our Dec. 11 viewpoint,
we don't think dialogue with one's oppres-
sor leads to liberation. Would explicitly rac-
ist U.S. laws have ended if Dr. Martin Luther
King, Jr. sat down with white leadership and
had a quick chat? Would British imperialism
in India have ended if Gandhi sat down with
royalty and asked them to leave? We don't
think so, and for the same reasons, we know
that dialogue will not free Palestine.
Joseph Varilone is an LSA senior.

lection years always feature
numbers that are supposed
to show the accomplish-
ments or errors
of a particu-
lar politician.
On Jan. 6, the
Bureau of Labor '
and Statistics
released its lat-
est unemploy-
ment data, and MATTHEW
politicians have ZABKA
been quick to
present these
data as beneficial to their support-
ed policies. Both President Barack
Obama and Republican Gov. Rick
Snyder have recently cited drop-
ping unemployment rates as a sign
that their economic policies are
working.
While it may seem that a drop in
the unemployment rate is a posi-
tive sign for the economy, this isn't
always the case. Some politicians
attempt to exploit such misunder-
standings of unemployment num-
bers, and it's therefore important
that one understands what unem-
ployment data says so one can accu-
rately judge politicians' claims.
All else constant, it's certainly
true that if enough jobs are created,
the unemployment rate will drop.
Economists say normal population
growth requires the economy to
add between 80,000 and 100,000
jobs per month to maintain a
steady unemployment rate If the
economy adds significantly more
than 100,000 jobs in a month, the
unemployment rate will drop, but
if fewer than 80,000 jobs are added
in a month, the unemployment rate
will rise.
With this information, a politi-
cian's claim that his policies added
jobs, but not enough to keep up with
population growth, should not be
sufficient to impress voters.
Obama's campaign released a

graph on Facebook on Jan. 3 that
shows the number of private sec-
tor jobs added per month. The
campaign claims the graph shows
Obama's strong record of job cre-
ation and specifically touts 21
months of growth. Ignore for a
moment that the graph examines
only a cross section of the econo-
my; including the entire economy
would have yielded a less flattering
picture. The graph still shows that
in several of the 21 months, fewer
jobs were created than necessary
to keep up with population growth.
This is no reason to brag, but a gen-
eral misunderstanding of economic
data that allows the Obama cam-
paign the opportunity to present
the graph as positive material.
To avoid falling for a politician's
slight of hand, understanding the
definitions used in any set of data is
key. The BLS defines the labor force
as anyone who is at least 16 years of
age and is either working or actively
seeking work. The unemployment
rate is then defined as the percentage
of the labor force that is unemployed.
By definition, a drop in the unem-
ployment rate only means that a
smaller percentage of the work force
is unemployed. Should a large num-
ber of unemployed people stop look-
ing for work and, by definition, leave
the workforce, the unemployment
rate will also drop. In this situation,
the unemployment rate looks better,
even though the country's economic
situation has worsened.
This unfortunately appears to be
the case for much of the post-reces-
sion economy. Even though few
jobs were created during the poorly
named "recovery summer" in 2010,
the United States's unemployment
rate was mostly constant. This was
because discouraged unemployed
people left the labor force.
Michigan's situation is particu-
larly noteworthy in this regard and
gives another example of a politician

using numbers that should impress
no one. Snyder said Michigan's
unemployment rate has dropped
below 10 percent for the first time
since he took office in his State of the
State address last month. But accord-
ing to the BLS, the number of jobs
in Michigan has remained almost
unchanged. Rather than new jobs
lowering the unemployment rate,
frustrated unemployed workers'
decisions to stop looking for work
have reduced Michigan's work force
and thus driven down Michigan's
unemployment rate.
Misuse of data
is more common
than you think.
This column only contains a
brief introduction to understanding
unemployment rates. Other factors,
like seasonal variation, can also
affect unemployment data. While
understanding the definitions
used is important, nobody can be
an expert on everything, and with
so many politicians trying to mis-
represent data for their advantage,
how can one accurately judge the
state of the economy?
The answer is to trust experts.
Voters should not give politicians a
free pass for misrepresenting eco-
nomic data. Listening to economists,
such as the ones regularly consulted
in The Wall Street Journal and The
New York Times, can serve as an
important fact-check against politi-
cians' economic claims.

tives, each of which represents
an incremental effort in the
direction of less pollution, less
energy use, less carbon dioxide in
the atmosphere, less water run-
off, less transportation cost and
impact, and more of many things
that have positive effects on peo-
ple's lives," Graham wrote.
He added that a combination
of small sustainability programs
ultimately adds up to large-scale
environmental change in the city.
"The list of these things that
we are thinking about and/or
actively working on at any given
time is quite surprisingly long,"
he wrote. "It is the combination
of each small success that makes
progress overall."
Andrew Brix, city energy pro-
grams manager, said support
from the city has helped further
sustainability efforts.
"I think that we're one of the
cities here in the U.S. that has a
very supportive population," Brix
said. "We've got a lot of support
from the University, and we've
got support on City Council, from
the mayor, and that is fantastic,
we're really lucky to have that."
The next sustainability forum
will take place next week, and
will focus on land use and access
including city transportation,
infrastructure and public spaces.
Apart from the forums, Mat-
thew Naud, city environmen-
tal coordinator, said the PACE
program will help Ann Arbor
improve its energy efficiency by
allowing commercial property
owners to borrow money from
the city in order to improve their
building's energy efficiency.

know local farmers and arti-
sans."
After shopping at farmer's
markets in Italy, she became
committed to using local ingredi-
ents in her cakes.
"In Italy, at the farmers'
markets, you buy everything
directly from the farmers and
every cheese and vegetable is
named after the region it is
from," Leavitt said. "I was really
inspired by the food culture and
knew that I wanted to explore
this when I came back to Michi-
gan."
Leavitt, who works with fel-
low University alum Claudia
Kimbell, said using seasonal and
local ingredients in their signa-
ture cakes makes their shop -
located on Metty Drive and open
only for appointments - unique
from other businesses.
"Two things that set us apart
from other bakeries are the
focus on local ingredients and
our artistic ability," Leavitt said.
"Our olive oil almond cake with
blood orange curd uses seasonal
winter citrus and pays homage
to my time in Italy."
In addition to utilizing local
products, Leavitt aims to keep
up with food industry trends

According to Naud, the city
will wait until it has $1 million in
potential projects through PACE
before looking into obtaining
loans for the projects.
Naud added that PACE will
not only help the environment,
but also improve Ann Arbor's
economy.
"I think the PACE program is
a real game changer," Naud said.
"It goes a long way to making our
built building stock more sus-
tainable, more energy efficient,
cheaper to businessinAnn Arbor,
more comfortable, and ideally, it's
all local contractors and local
jobs doing that work so it's a huge
economic multiplier in the com-
munity."
According to Naud, Ann Arbor
spends about $250 million per
year on natural gas and electric-
ity, and he said he hopes PACE
will lower the city's spending by
improving inefficient heating in
buildings, particularly off-cam-
pus student housing.
Naud said he believes student
housing is the largest sustainabil-
ity issue in the city, and with the
University supplying about 7,000
new student renters every year,
Ann Arbor should continue to
make it a priority to improve.
"It's not hard to walk around
downtown and go through some
of the student neighborhoods
and you see the upstairs attic
room they've occupied with the
windows open in the wintertime
because it's so hot and the air
conditioner is actually still in the
window," Naud said. "It's a huge
waste of energy."
He added that the city hopes
to decrease energy waste in stu-
dent housing through a $3 million
grant that Washtenaw County
and the expectations of clients.
She works closely with her cus-
tomers to become familiar with
their style, in order to decide
what type of individualized cake
may appeal to them most.
"Each cake is totally unique
for each person," Leavitt said. "I
recreate their personality with
their cake. It's a varied process
starting with sketches and tast-
ings, all the way down to the
final details."
After graduating in 2007,
Leavitt gained hands-on baking
experience at local eateries such
as Decadent Delight, Cake Nou-
veau and Eve the Restaurant.
At Eve the Restaurant, Leavitt
developed recipes and refined
her taste palette as she worked
toward developing her small
business by baking for friends
and family - including baking
her first wedding cake, which
she made for her best friend's
nuptials.
Aside from working on her
business, Leavitt also competed
on the Food Network Chal-
lenge twice while working with
Courtney Clark of Cake Nou-
veau in Oct. 2008 and Jan. 2009.
On the show, cooks, pastry chefs
and culinary artists from across
the nation compete on television
in a food battle for cash prices,
according to foodnetwork.com.
"It was an amazing experi-

received from the U.S. Depart-
ment of Housing and Urban
Development in November.
Washtenaw County was one
of four communities to receive
the grant to make communities
more economically competitive
through initiatives that improve
housing, schools and transporta-
tion.
Naud said use of the grant
money has not yet been deter-
mined, but hopes that it will be
used for education on efficient
energy use for students in the
county.
"One of the things we proposed
is a three-year effort to hire a per-
son to really work with landlords,
renters and the universities to fig-
ure out what are the educational
efforts we can do," Naud said.
"How do we teach (students) how
to be sustainable on campus and
then live sustainably when they
move into off campus housing?"
Naud added that 20 percent of
the city's operations use renew-
able energy from the generation
of hydroelectric power at two
dams on the Huron River. The
city also uses a landfill gas col-
lection system and sells back
the energy from such facilities
to DTE Energy, which displaces

said. "I was competing against
(my) idols. I was never very com-
petitive in high school sports,
but I found a competitive edge
with cake decorating. It was a
cool place to share ideas and
techniques. The reality show
created a nationwide commu-
nity."
In additionto providingbaked
goods for the Ann Arbor com-
munity, Leavitt was also a guest
lecturer in the Penny W. Stamps
Speaker Series, an annual event
at the School of Art & Design.
"The art schoolis a really spe-
cial place," Leavitt said. "I made
a lot of connections and am still
in touch with my professors and
the school. I bake cakes for them
and have done some catering
work with the University."
Leavitt said the University's
supportive alumni network has
made Ann Arbor a prosperous
and rewarding location for her
cake shop, adding the company
has secured a space on North
Main Street and is planning to
move their business there soon.
"Baking personal cakes and
wedding cakes is a very inti-
mate process," Leavitt said. "It's
fabulous to hear from satisfied
customers and see the finished
product."

due to a few unused scholarships
and a need to fill the void left on
the kick-return team when wide
receiver Darryl Stonum was dis-
missed in mid-January.
Just how late did Hoke and Co.
turn to the 5-foot-6 Norfleet?
"To be honest with you, it was
pretty much yesterday," Hoke
said.
Nonetheless, Norfleet quickly
flipped his commitment from
Cincinnati to Michigan and fired
up the fax machine, joining Ann
Arbor Pioneer's Drake Johnson
to form the class' running back
duo.
But the most important area of
need addressed by the staff was
in the trenches on both sides of
the ball.
Of the 25 commits, 12 will
be on the front lines. Michi-
gan graduated three starting
defensive linemen, two starting
offensive lineman and a pair of
tight ends from Team 132. These
freshmen will be expected to fill
those voids.
"We're always going to take
guys up front," Hoke said. "You
just think about the pounding of
the game of football. Most of it
wears at the line of scrimmage,
so we've always got to be recruit-
ing three, four, five offensive
linemen a year. Same thing with

can't tolerate.
In many cases, patients are
hesitant to undergo treatment
because of the intensity of the
medication, Lok said. To com-
bat this, the study found suc-
cess using a drug that does not
contain interferon, but rather, a
combination of two direct-act-
ing anti-viral agents.
"It's the first ever study to
prove that you can get a cure
even though the patients never
receive interferon," Lok said.
Lok said she and her col-
leagues dreamed of finding a
cure without using interferon
for years, but the possibility
seemed unlikely. She added that
this is the first study to show
that it's possible to better fight
hepatitis.
Lok said all 21 subjects in the
study had been diagnosed with
hepatitis C virus genotype 1, the
most difficult type to treat, and
that they had not responded to
treatment in the past. The sub-
jects were randomly assigned to

defensive linemen.
"So are we replenished? No,
but we're making progress."
Anchoring the trenches will
be a pair of Rivals.com five-star
behemoths. Hoke's staff flipped
offensive tackle Kyle Kalis from
an Ohio State commitment in
July and added defensive tackle
Ondre Pipkins - a 6-foot-3, 325-
pound specimen - a month later.
Hoke called Kalis "a road-
grading guy." And "Pee Wee"
Pipkins?
"Pee Wee, uhh, he's a big man,"
Hoke said.
Fair point. But the big men
might not all be off the board.
Four-star offensive lineman
Jordan Diamond from Chicago,
who will decide his college des-
tination tomorrow, has Michigan
among the handful of teams he is
considering.
When asked whether the 25
commits completed the recruit-
ing class, Hoke gave a smile.
"We'll see," he said.
Geographic proximity is the
most distinct feature of this
group of recruiting. Eighteen of
the incoming freshmen hail from
the states of Michigan and Ohio.
"You've got to protect the
backyard," said defensive coor-
dinator Greg Mattison.
Another crucial factor in the
coaches' recruiting process was
securing the majority of the
commitments early in the year,
before Michigan's season kicked
two testing groups.
The first group consisted
of 11 patients who were given
a combination of two direct-
acting anti-viral agents. Of the
11 patients, four achieved a
sustained virologic response -
meaning the hepatitis C virus
wasn't detected in the patients'
blood 12 weeks after treatment.
"Four out of 11 is not all that
great, but it's actually very excit-
ing because these are patients
who have not responded to any
previous treatment," Lok said.
"Getting any response is better
than nothing."
A second group of 10 patients
was treated with interferon, but
showed an improved response
rate. When they were given the
same two drugs paired with
pegylated interferon and riba-
virin, all 10 patients achieved a
sustained virologic response.
Lok said the study will be
conducted in two phases, and
it needs to go through another
phase of research before the
FDA can approve it. She added
that though most researched
drugs never become available
commercially, she was optimis-
where walking is the most com-
mon mode of transportation.
"Yesterday, I went out with
only a light jacket," Lee said.
"And I actually enjoyed walking
to class."

tunity to use their bicycles due

off in early September. By the
opener, 20 of the class's 25 mem-
bers had committed to the Wol-
verines.
According to Hoke, Michi-
gan's quality of education and
standing as the winningest pro-
gram in college football history
led to the early recruiting suc-
cess, beginning with offensive
lineman Ben Braden's commit-
ment in early March.
"Having those early com-
mitments definitely helped,"
Hoke said. "Because you see
those guys working and recruit-
ing guys that they want to play
with."
With the 2012 class all but
wrapped up, Mattison said the
coaching staff would take an
hour off and then get right back
to work to fill the 2013 recruit-
ing class in a similarly efficient
manner.
There's no rest for the weary,
but work on the recruiting trail
can make the coaching staff's
job easier down the road.
"The longer you're engaged
(with recruits) and building
those relationships and the
information and the commit-
ment, it's like going to the bank,"
Hoke said. "You're putting your
money in the bank. You're mak-
ing the commitment. It's no
different. When you commit to
people and they see that com-
mitment, usually things go pret-
ty well."
tic that it could be a possibility.
"I expect that the drugs in
this particular study will have
the chance to see daylight
because the results are good,"
Lok said.
Thelma King Thiel, chair of
the Hepatitis Foundation Inter-
national, said because hepatitis
C is not accompanied by strong
symptoms or signs, many people
with the infection are unaware
of their condition. Though
patients may not experience
much physical pain, Thiel said
they may suffer psychologically.
"Although they feel fine,
patients often are psychologi-
cally depressed knowing that
they have a communicable dis-
ease that can lead to cirrhosis
and cancer of the liver," Thiel
said.
Thiel said new cures for hepa-
titis C, such as the one studied
by Lok, reportedly have fewer
side effects and have the poten-
tial to cure patients who have not
responded to other treatments.
"We have hope that they
will be more effective treat-
ments than those currently pre-
scribed," Thiel said.

Kalis headlines formidable Wolverine front

By TIM ROHAN
Daily Sports Writer
Short-handed but not discour-
aged, Darrell Funk found that the
hardest part of his job in 2011 was
logistics. With just eight offensive
lineman on scholarship - most
programs have about 14 - Funk's
graduate assistant, Roy Manning,
would joke with Funk that it took
him a half hour every day just to
figure out the rotations for prac-
tice.
He'd sit down and think out
all of the scenarios, which grew
more complicated when redshirt
junior Ricky Barnum went down
with an injury. After the starting
five, who backed up whom? And
in practice, where would the reps
go?
"Sleepless nights are kind of
a given for an (offensive) line
coach," said Funk, who now must
deal with losing his Rimington
Trophy winning center, David
Molk, and a reliable fifth-year
senior in Mark Hugye.
Here come reinforcements.
National Signing Day on
Wednesday was good to Funk,
who will have four quality
recruits - the best class he's ever
had, he said - who will make
his job much easier. When Funk
coached at Colorado State, he
said, he once had a four-man class
that featured all four-year start-
ers, and each one spent time in
the NFL.
"If you go 4-for-4 with all NFL
guys, that's a good class," Funk
said. "And this class is more tal-
ented than that.
"It's going to be a few years
before we get exactly where we
want, but I'm telling you, the
quality of the kids just got better
with these four."
Targetingsize to help alongthe
transition to a pro-style offense,
Michigan coach Brady Hoke

you. And that's one thing that
Kyle does real well."
Funk laughed, describing one
clip in which Kalis knocked over
an umpire "when he was throw-
ing someone around" and couldn't
decide whether to help the man
up or find another victim.
On Wednesday, the potential
of Kalis and Magnuson stood out,
but so did one absence - that of a
legitimate center recruit.
For four years, Molk may have
been the offensive line's most
indispensable player, providing
cohesion and consistency. When
he tore a tendon in his foot during
warmups before the Sugar Bowl
in January, redshirt junior Rocko
Khoury stepped in for three
disastrous plays.
"I think three bad snaps and
an offensive series with negative
yardage helped it," Molk said last
week. "I just taped it up, sucked it
up and played."
Though he sounded confident,
Funk wasn't as upbeat when he
ran through the successors to
replace Molk, all of whom have
practiced at center: Khoury,
who'll be a fifth-year senior; Elliot
Mealer, the do-everything back-
up; Barnum, who's never played
center in a game at Michigan but
has in practice; and two unher-
alded youngsters, freshman Jack
Miller and redshirt freshman
Joey Burzynski.
The lack of a new scholarship
freshman in that mix wasn't due
to a lack of trying.
"I'm not saying we didn't
recruit a center," Funk said. "But
with these four (we did sign),
these guys are going to play other
positions and we'll - at least for
another year - we'll use the guys
that we have in the program to
anchor that down.
"We'll be fine."
If not, Funk may suffer through
many more sleepless nights.

ERIN KIRKLAND/Daily
Michigan redshirt sophomore Taylor Lewan and redshirt junior Patrick Omameh are joined by a four offensive linemen in incoming 2012 recruiting class.

nabbed Kyle Kalis (305 pounds),
Erik Magnuson (275), Blake Bars
(275) and Ben Braden (319) - all of
them exceed 6-foot-5.
Hoke and Funk recruit line-
man with positions in mind they
have Magnuson - a consensus
four-star recruit - pegged as a
left tackle, with his prerequisite
athleticism and basketball back-
ground.
Bars and Braden have tackle-
like bodies Funk said, but will
slide inside to play guard. Bars
is a four-star lineman, Braden a
three-star, according to Rivals.
com.
During recruiting, Funk told
them that a redshirt season
wasn't a guarantee. Hoke's man-
tra, the best players are going to
play, rings true on the offensive

line. If a freshman is in the top
two spots in the depth chart,
Funk said, he could play immedi-
ately. It just might not be at their
optimal position.
"For all the guys that I've had
that have had the chance to go on
to the NFL, most of them didn't
finish their career at the same
position they got their first start,"
Funk said. His hand was forced
last season, when Barnum's inju-
ry forced redshirt sophomore
Michael Schofield to play at guard
for most of the season.
"You ask a kid, 'Hey, you're
going to be a left tackle, but do
you want to start this game at
this position?' or 'You're going to
be a right guard, but do you want
to play backup or do you want to
play?' And usually they say they

want to play," Funk said.
Kalis, who may be the gem of
the group, wants to play imme-
diately: He told Funk he wants to
be a right tackle, which has a gap-
ing hole with Hugye graduating.
Funk obliged, and Kalis will be a
right tackle, but the starter's spot
isn't guaranteed.
Hoke described Kalis as a
"powerful, strong, road-grading
type of offensive lineman." The
recruiting websites disagreed
with each other slightly - Rivals.
com pegged Kalis as a five-star
recruit, Scout.com had him as a
four star.
Funk fondly recalled the first
time he spoke with Kalis, who
decommitted from Ohio State
once Jim Tressel was fired. Funk
had to excuse himself from a
a KYLE KALIS - 0L

family dinner at Damon's in Ann
Arbor. He wouldn't say when
exactly they first spoke, other
than it was cold outside and
"more than seven months ago."
Funk remembered Kalis know-
ing Michigan tradition, asking
great questions and hitting it off
well. Outside the restaurant was
a big picture of Jake Long. Funk
mentioned it to Kalis, who knew
all about the All-American with
a mean streak similar to his own.
"He just wants to tear your
head off every play," Funk said.
"And we need that. ... You can
have really good skill positions
guys like we have, and that's
important. But at the end of the
day, it starts up front.
"It starts with knocking the
heck out of the guy across from

Glendening leads by example

By LIZ VUKELICH
Daily Sports Writer
Michigan hockey coach Red
Berenson doesn't keep official
tabs on who wins the shuttle runs
during practice. But if he did,
senior captain Luke Glendening
would have his name showing up
on yet another stats sheet.
Each week, the Wolverines
line up at one end of the rink and
sprint as fast as they can down
the ice and back with their line-
mates. It's standard for any sport,
especially one like hockey - the
players' ability to consistently win
footraces night in and night out
can make or break a game.
Lucky for Michigan, it has
Glendening.
"I don't know if he was as fast
when he got here, but he really
worked hard as a freshman,"
Berenson said. "He's got a com-
pete level that is off-the-charts,
that is showing up on the ice and
in his skating."
Some of Glendening's speed
just comes naturally. Junior for-
ward A.J. Treais jokingly referred
to his linemate as "freak," citing
superior genetics as a reason why
Glendening is so quick on the ice.
But in reality, it has to do more
with nurture than nature. Beren-
son and Treais are in agree-
ment that no Wolverine is as
disciplined in the weight room
as Glendening. Throughout his
time at Michigan, Glendening
has added muscle to his 5-foot-
11 frame without bulking up too
much.
In past seasons, it was easy
for Glendening's quickness to be
overshadowed by that of former
Wolverine Carl Hagelin. Hage-
lin, who recently won the title of
fastestskater at the NHL All-Star
Game, was known throughout
his Michigan career as a speed-
ster who never lost a race.
But after Hagelin's gradua-
tion last year, it was Glendening's
turn to come up and claim the top
spot.
It's easy to see Glendening's
speed and strength manifest

Michigan tries to
shake the slump

ERIN KIRKLAND/Daily
Senior forward Luke Glendening is a two-year captain for Michigan coach Red Berenson's hockey team.

By MATT SPELICH
Daily Sports Writer
There comes a point in every
season when a team must lay
everything on the line. For the
Michigan women's basketball
team, that moment will be this
Thursday,
when the Wol- NWestem
verines square
off against at Michigan
Northwestern. Matchup: NU
The oppo- 13-9; Michi-
nent has very gan16-6
littlebearingon When: Thurn-
the significance day 6:30 P.M.
of this game -
there are larger Where: Crisier
forces at work.
More impor- TV/Radio:
tant is that this BTN
will be Michi-
gan's first time battling back from
two consecutive losses.
The Wolverines, known for
their resilience and slump-resis-
tance, were served a pair of losses
this past week courtesy of No. 18
Penn State and unranked Wis-
consin.
While some are calling this a
sink-or-swim game for the Wol-
verines, the players remain hope-
ful and determined to stop the
slide.
"It's extra motivating for us
to win coming off of two losses,"
said senior guard Carmen Reyn-
olds. "We tend to bounce back
quick, and so we really need to get
it done tomorrow on the court."
Though the Wolverines aren't
overly concerned with records,
Michigan coach Kevin Borseth
understands that winning Thurs-
day's game is essential for keep-
ing his team's postseason hopes
alive. A loss here could really
damage its chances as time runs
out on this waning season.
"We are looking to get back on
track and get to the NCAA Tour-
nament," Borseth said. "Being

successful in games is what we're
all looking to do, obviously. Our
wins and losses are behind us
now though, and right now all we
can do is do whatever it takes to
get back on the winning track."
The Wildcats are 3-6 in Big
Ten play, but the last time they
played the Wolverines, Michigan
squeaked by with a 58-48 win
after a long defensive battle on
both sides of the court. Though
the Wolverines' defense has seen
major improvements as the sea-
son has progressed, Michigan
has struggled to put points on
the board in its last few games. A
strong defensive team like North-
western may prove the Wolver-
ines' undoing.
"We just got to, put the darn
basketball in the hoop," Reyn-
olds said. "We always rely on our
defense. Ard although defense
wins games, we have to find ways
to translate into offense, to get
some shots in rhythm and to not
force anything."
The other foreseeable prob-
lem for Michigan will be deal-
ing with the 6-foot-5 Dannielle
Diamant, who has shown her-
self to be a handful on both sides
of the court. It's assumed that
junior center Rachel Sheffer will
be matched up on Diamant in
the game on Thursday. It will be
interesting to see how Sheffer,
the Wolverines' leading scorer
over the last two weeks, will han-
die the pressure from a larger and
equally high-scoring post player.
"Diamant's size is definitely
going to be a factor," Borseth
said. "I mean any time you have
a 6-foot-5 kid and you put her in
the right spot at the right time,
there's not a whole lot you can

Conlon lifts vault to new heights

By BEN SEIDMAN
Daily Sports Writer
Late one night, sophomore
Victoria Wesley received a text
message from Shean Conlon
asking her to open her e-mail.
Wesley found an in-depth e-mail
about how he could improve her
performance, and Wesley could
tell how much time he put into
it. A husband, coach and former
athlete, Conlon is a mad scientist
at heart.
Unpaid volunteer assistant
coach Shean Conlon has trans-
formed the Michigan men's and
women's pole vaulting program
through innovative techniques
and a contagious passion for the
art of the pole vault.
Originally from Colorado,
Conlon has two major interests
- archaeology and pole vaulting.
At Oberlin he earned a degree in
archaeology, and then a master's
degree in exercise physiology
at Eastern Michigan University
some years later. Through his
connections at Eastern Michi-
gan, he met Michigan men's
track coach Fred LaPlante.
His love for pole vaulting runs
deep. He tried to articulate why
exactly he cannot get away from
the sport.
"The actual physical experi-
ence of it is like a roller coaster
ride," Conlon said. "There's
nothing like the feeling of jump-
ing into a fifteen foot fiberglass
pole and feeling it bend on the
energy you created - it's kinda
weird - but by far the greatest
feeling is once you get upside
down and the pole thrusts you
into the air.
"The greatest part for me
is the instant when you peak
and gravity has not taken over
yet and you stall out above the
bar and in that instant you are

weightless."
A man who has done archaeo-
logical digs all around the world
is now in charge of both the
men's and women's pole vault-
ing, a role that no coach at Mich-
igan has filled in a long time.
One of the most impactful
things Conlon brings to Michi-
gan is his fervent passion and
his constant desire to be better.
A true competitor as an athlete,
Conlon tries to bring that same
intensity to his coaching profes-
sion.
"I want to be the best coach I
can be, and I want to help them
in every way I can," Conlon said.
"It's almost like an obsession."
Conlon has the pole vault con-
stantly on his mind. When he is
done with practice, he goes home
and does more work, whether it
is watching film or learning new
scientific approaches.
Training smartly is key for
Conlon. His master's degree has
aided him in applying the physi-
ology to the techniques he uses
in practice. His recent study of
biomechanics and physics has
helped him to understand which
methods can help vaulters most.
One of the coaching methods
he uses is periodization, a help-
ful technique to set time incre-
ments between activities in
order to increase productivity.
Conlon bases the training on
the individual and how long it
takes that person to learn a new
technique before moving on.
"I just spend all my time on
the vault," Conlon said. "I go to
different coaching clinics, I've
gotten different certifications, I
just get information from any-
where and everywhere I pos-
sibly can. Every year I try new
things."
Conlon's perfectionism has
rubbed off on the athletes he

coaches. After every vault, he
tells them exactly what went
wrong - even if it was a good
vault - and how they can
improve on it for the next vault.
"Once they saw that my pas-
sion matched their own, it's been
great," Conlon said. "There are
always ups and downs, but I feel
like they trust me and I trust
them, and it works out."
Though working with two
teams might seem burdensome,
Conlon embraces the challenge.
"I am the first coach in a
long time to work with both
the men and the women so I am
in a unique situation," Conlon
said. "I have to let two different
groups of people know what's
going on with the athletes and
have to figure out who I'm going
to travel with on each weekend."
Conlon has a way of bring-
ing out the best in the athletes
he coaches, helping them reach
their potential.
"He sets your goals so high
and you don't realize," sopho-
more Kiley Tobel said. "Goals
at the beginning of the season
made me think he was crazy, but
he makes you realize how attain-
able they, are makes you realize
what you are capable of."
Conlon also tries to make
vaulting larger than life for the
athletes to instill confidence and
passion amongst them.
When Conlon came to Michi-
gan, Tobel remembers her
outlook on the sport changed
because she knew he would
make her the best vaulter she
could be.
"It's not just something I do
anymore it's really a part of my
life," Tobel said.
"It gets scary, but if you don't
trust yourself, you're going to
fail that every time," Wesley
added. "You have to have full

confidence or else its notgoingto
work. Shean has taught me that."
Conlon only wants the best
for all of his athletes, as he sets
every type of goal one can imag-
ine. His goals are often lofty, but
in his mind, anything is possible.
He walks around with a sheet
of paper, where he writes down
all of the meets for the year
with the long-term goals. When
Tobel took a peek at what it said
under "outdoor," she saw "Olym-
pic trials." Tobel just thought
to herself, "Oh my God, this is
ridiculous."
Maybe Conlon is a great coach
because he doesn't play favor-
ites and gives everyone the same
amount of attention. Maybe it;s
because he barely sleeps. Maybe
it's because he is young and can
relate to the athletes easily.
Either way, the Michigan
track and field teams have a gem
at the pole-vaulting coaching
spot who is helping young men
and women reach new heights
through his love of the sport,
fiery enthusiasm and unique
work ethic.
Conlon believes that he will
be at Michigan for the next cou-
ple of years, but even Tobel and
Wesley admit that he will soon
be recruited by some of the best
track and field programs in the
country.
"I could see myself coaching
for the rest of my life, but that's
such an absurd thought," Conlon
said. "If I get to the point where
I am satisfied with everything
that I have done, I could see
myself moving on because there
is no longer that fire to get better
and better.
"So far, I really want to get
better and all my athletes to get
better. After that, I could see
myself getting back into archae-
ology or teaching."

The two freshmen that have
taken the Big Ten by storm this
year met on Wednesday night
for round two.
Michigan point guard Trey
Burke and Indiana center Cody
Zeller have brought their teams
to new heights this season and
figure to have much of their
teams' responsibilities on their
shoulders down the stretch of
the conference season.
"Both are very poised beyond
their years," said senior guard
Stu Douglass. "That head-to-
head thing is a tough compari-
son. What makes them special
is their poise and their ability
to not let things bother them.
They're hitting that freshman
wall and just busting through it.
That stuff doesn't affect them."
Zeller dominated the first go-
round in January, making8 of 10
shots for 18 points as he helped
the Hoosiers to a 73-71 victory in
Bloomington.
Burke struggled that night,
scoring just 10 points on 15 field-
goal attempts. He missed three
free throws that would have
been the difference in the game,
which was decided in the final
minute.
For Tuesday's rematch, Dou-
glass said Burke's matchup with
Zeller in Ann Arbor was not on
the freshman's mind.
"Last game, (the media) tried
to pin him against (Ohio State's
Jared) Sullinger and (Aaron)
Craft, and he doesn't look into
that," Douglass said. "He just
wants to win. We put a lot of
responsibility in his hands, so
he's just focused in on winning
games, making winning plays."
Added Burke: "I tried not to
get caught up with that tonight.
Plus, we're two different posi-
tions. He was definitely the top
player on our (scouting report),
that was the main point - to
stop him. But I really didn't
think about (the personal
matchup)."
This time around, it looked
like it would be all Burke from
the get-go.

TODD E s LE/Daily
Freshman guard Trey Burke scored a game-hith 18 points against Indiana.

The Columbus native
matched his point total from the
January game in the first 6:21
of play on Wednesday. Burke
zipped down the line and fin-
ished with his right hand to
open the scoring, and he was
only getting started.
"This young man has seen
everything," said Michi-
gan coach John Beilein about
how opponents defend Burke.
"Whether they double, wheth-
er they go under the screen,
whether they hedge and recov-
er. He's trying to read it all the
time, and they're locking the
rails. They're putting a big guy
on him, they're putting a small
guy on him. He's learning all the
time."
Burke knocked down two con-
secutive 3-pointers two minutes
later as the Wolverines jumped
out to a 10-0 lead. That jumped
to 15-2 when Burke added
another layup, but his produc-
tion came to a sudden halt.
As the 20-point Michigan
lead dwindled, Zeller began to
assert himself and Burke disap-
peared from the boxescore.
Burke didn't score again until

30 minutes later, when Michi-
gan was clinging to a four-point
lead.
While he wasn't dominant,
Zeller put up another impres-
sive stat line, recording 11 points
and 12 rebounds. The Hoosiers
had trouble getting him the ball
in the post consistently, and he
relied on second-chance points.
He was able to out-rebound the
entire Wolverine frontcourt.
Though Burke made only one
field goal in the second half, he
salted the game from the free-
throw line. He made six free
throws down the stretch to tie
for a game-high 18 points as
Michigan completed its 68-56
victory.
The two are the runaway
leaders in the Big Ten Fresh-
man of the Year race, though
both deny thinking about the
award. Burke averages 14 points
and five assists, while Zeller
is putting up 15 points and six
rebounds per game.
"I don't worry about awards
or anything, so it's not a big
deal," Zeller said.
Added Burke: "Right now, I
really don't care."

Connor Jaeger isn't as vis-
ible as Denard Robinson, though
he's been just as effective. He's
not a professional prospect like
Tim Hardaway Jr., though he
has the skills. And no, he's not a
household name at Michigan like
Shawn Hunwick.
He should be.
The sophomore has been a
vital part of the No. 4 Michigan
men's swimming and diving
team. Swimming butterfly and
freestyle events for the Wolver-
ines, Jaeger has tallied three
event wins in the past two meets.
Swimming was always second
nature to Jaeger. Growing up in
Fair Haven, N.J. , Jaeger lived
close to the beach and joined a
beach club, which furthered his
enthusiasm for swimming.
"My parents had me take swim
lessons, so I knew how to swim
from a pretty young age" Jaeger
said. "And at these beach clubs
they actually had swim meets
against each other... so I was on
that at a really young age, com-
peting for the beach club."
Jaeger carried his passion
throughout his childhood and
into his adolescence. When high
school rolled around, Jaeger seri-
ously entertained the notion of
becoming a collegiate swimmer.
Junior year, when thinking about
where to take his talents, Michi-
gan emerged as his first choice.
"I was always impressed with
Michigan athletics," Jaeger said.
"When I started taking my trips,
I was always comparing every-
thing else to Michigan."
The transition was not easy.
College brings about its own set
of challenges: adjusting to new
locations, people and classes.
Amid the hype and expectations,
fans tend to forget the fact that
student-athletes are mere mor-
tals too, regardless of what they
do on the field or in the pool. Jae-
ger faced the same rough waters
as other freshmen.
"Freshmen year was definitely
hard, adjusting from my easy

club practices," Jaeger said. "And
obviously school was a lotharder,
so that was a lot to adjust to."
What helped Jaeger adjust,
though, was what he described
as a big-brother system. It was
a support system to help every-
one settle in with the team, give
advice, monitor progress - in
essence, have each others back.
His big brother happened to be
senior and current captain Dan
Madwed. And the rookie was
able to adjust very well: Jaeger
was named to the 2011 All-Big
Ten first team after his fresh-
man campaign and was part of
the 800-yard freestyle relay that
won the Big Ten Championship.
As with all athletes, though, he
wanted more.
"I was expecting a lot from
myself at the end of the year,"
Jaeger said. "Guys on the team
were stepping up and helping me
out when I couldn't really per-
form the way that I should have
been able to.
"(Last season's performance)
actually did motivate me to work
harder because I did not want to
be in that position again...I didn't
want to feel that helpless to the
team," Jaeger said. "Hard work
with the team this past summer
has given me the confidence to
go on and race the way that I do
now."

It was evident Jaeger had
left the past behind in his meet
against Notre Dame this season.
He won the 1,000-yard free-
style by shattering his best time
by an astonishing 15 seconds
and added a first-place finish
in the 500-yard freestyle, help-
ing Michigan to a 55-point win.
Since then, Jaeger has continued
his fine form. He is one of the
few swimmers to win multiple
Big Ten Swimmer of the Week
honors, the most recent of which
came Jan. 18 after a lone event
win on the final day of the SMU
Classic helped Michigan edge
out No. 5 USC by six points.
He asserted his dominance
with an exclamation mark this
past weekend, out swimming U
Ohio State's Alex Miller in the
500-yard freestyle - an event in
which Jaeger is ranked second
in the nation - by four seconds.
This may not seem like much,
but ina sport where winners and
losers and determined by hun-
dredths of a second, four seconds
is a blow out. But Jaeger isn't
done improving quite yet.
"I wouldn't describe this as
my breakout year because the
year isn't finished yet," Jaeger
said. "All of how I've swam so
far doesn't really mean anything
unless I swim fast at the end of
the season."

Rave makes film friendly
to those with disabilities

Eulogy for Seal
and Heidi

Sensory Sensitive
1 Cinema eases
movie-going
By ANNA SADOVSKAYA
Daily Fine Arts Editor
Lining up for premieres, load-
ing up on popcorn and squeezing
into the last seat of sold-out films
0defines movie-going for many,
but it's easy to take for granted
the ability to jump in a car and
zip over to the movie theater. For
those who are affected by disabili-
ties or are classified on the autism
spectrum, sitting politely and
quietly during a movie can be dif-
ficult. Especially for families with
autistic or disabled children, mov-
ie-going may turn into a stressful
excursion that can frustrate par-
ents, children and perhaps even
other people in the theater.
Dr. Catherine Lord - former
director of the Autism & Com-
munication Disorders Center at
tthe 'U' and present director of the
new institute for Brain Develop-
ment at New York-Presbyterian
Hospital, Weill-Cornell Medical
College - is at the forefront of
autism research and treatment.
According to Lord, individu-
als with autism may have dif-
ficulty sitting through regular
movie screenings due to repeti-
tive motor gesticulations and an
inability to connect with the film
material, which can stem from
symptoms of their disorders.
To help families with special
needs, Rave Motion Pictures's
Sensory Sensitive Cinema pro-
vides a new way to experience the
delight of seeing a film on the big
screen.
"Sensory Sensitive Cinema is
the normal feature with a couple
exceptions," said Kelly Mervyn,
general manager of Rave Motion
Pictures. "The lights are going
to be up, the sound's going to
be lower' and the folks seeing it
will be mainly families with dis-
abilities, such as autism or Down

Sensory Sensitive Cinema shows features with lights on and the sound lowered.

syndrome, who want to go see a
movie but don't want to have the
problem of a child being loud or
disruptive."
By altering certain aspects of
the movie-going experience, Rave
Cinemas provides film-lovers
with disabilities the chance to see
their favorite movies in an envi-
ronment more accommodative to
their needs.
Every fourth Saturday of each
month, families can travel to Rave
in order to experience Sensory
Sensitive Cinema. Each person
who buys a ticket for a movie is
told of the viewing's special fea-
tures.
Sensory Sensitive Cinema
sprung from collaborative meet-
ings that set out to widen the
population of Rave Cinemas visi-
tors.
"We were trying to come up
with ways to get more folks to
come," Mervyn said. "Most of
these ideas come from that direc-
tion, and (Sensory Sensitive
Cinema) in particular is highly
important to us."
Sensory Sensitive Cinema is

suitable for people of all ages, as
the atmosphere is more relaxed
and calming for anyone affected
by disabilities.
"Our next movie, 'Journey 2:
The Mysterious Island,' is not
only for children," Mervyn said.
"We try to gear it towards as
many people as we can. Of course
it's going to be more family-
oriented, but if you're a fan of a
movie, your age won't matter."
Though experiences such as
Sensory Sensitive Cinema cater to
the needs of individuals with dis-
abilities, there is still a shroud of
obscurity surrounding disorders
like autism, according to Lord.
"About 1 percent (of people in
the U.S. are affected by autism),
which covers the whole range -
from kids and adults that have
very severe intellectual disabili-
ties, to those that are very bright
and articulate but still have the
social difficulties or sensory
issues you associate with autism,"
Lord said.
This range, according to Lord,
is the mystery behind autism. Peo-
ole may see Hollywood oortravals

of the disorder or know friends
and neighbors with autism, and
thus picture the disorder based
on a single individual. But autism
affects people differently, and the
key to understanding the mystery
behind the disorder is to see it as
a range, rather than a concrete
diagnosis.
"The reason why we keep talk-
ing about the spectrum rather
than ahundred different disorders
is because there are core features
that are present in all of them,"
Lord said. "It's about understand-
ing the different aspects of social
behavior, but there is also the
need to understand the core fea-
tures that are usually present."
These core features of autism
include repetition and social diffi-
culties, where individuals express
repetitive behavior and an inabil-
ity to connect with the subject at
hand.
"You may have one child with
autism who is very significantly
delayed and have another thathas
mild problems and is very bright
intellectually," Mervyn said.
Just as most people enjoy the
entertainment that films provide,
those with autism and other dis-
abilities also want to experience
the excitement of movie-going.
"It's a great experience,"
Lord said of Sensory Sensitive
Cinema. "I think children and
adults (with autism) really enjoy
videos, enjoy stories and anima-
tion. They enjoy visual input and
music, but the general atmo-
sphere of a movie may be over-
whelming. This program allows
them to become accustomed
with movie-going rather than
feel lost in it."
Rave's Sensory Sensitive Cin-
ema is set up in such a way that
allows for any individual, no mat-
ter where they are on the autism
spectrum, to enjoy a movie.
"I think this example is a'really
good one, where you have a facili-
ty that, by making minor changes,
allows for a wider public," Lord
said. "They'll make movie-goers
of children that usually wouldn't
have that opportunity."

Shakespeare also uses the play

to emphasize the characters'

conveys his true beliefs when he
describes "the evil that men do."

able to draw his own attention

to Cornish, the music is a great
facilitator, which enables stu-
dents to become familiar' with
the text.
"Everybody can live with this
opera as much as they want,"
Cornish said.
Opera texts, known as libretti,
are full of difficult and archaic
language forms. Students discuss
opera as literature and anno-
tate the libretti with an eye for
character development, images
and recurring motifs, as well as
grammar, cultural background
and even musical analysis. At
performances, they even critique
the translation in subtitles.
"Students can internalize the
Italian language, but not just
mundane phrases - passion-
ate phrases about love, death,
betrayal, despair and life," Cor-
nish said.
Considering Cornish's other
work, the relationship between
different strains of Italian is
a foundational element of the
course. Her examination of ver-
nacular Italian translation of
classical literature provides an
understanding not only of the
time of the translators and the
literature they worked on, but of
the overall relationship between
language and literature.
According to Cornish, ver-
nacular languages exist within
a local context and have limited
accessibility. But the vernacu-
lars of Italy became cosmopoli-
tan languages when they were
written down in literary form.
Cornish's book, "Vernacular
Translation in Dante's Italy: Illit-
erate Literature," examines the
"ocean of translated work" that
lies between the first literary
experiments in 13th century Italy
and the "Divine Comedy," which
was written 60 years after the
original, nascent works in ver-
nacular Italian.
It is particularly appropriate
that Cornish examines translated
works, because in intertextual
examinations, we find the most
profound insights about the cre-
ation of literature. The manu-
scripts were initially supposed to
be simple copies, but scribes often
corrected and improved on each
other's works, and even annotat-
ed or clarified the originals.
This phenomenon "demon-
strates how many people are
involved in the production of
literature," Cornish said. The
"chain of people" tried to make
sense of Virgil. Cicero. Ovid and

naabemowin, it was illegal to
teach the language until the pas-
sage of the Native American Lan-
guages Act of 1990. Fortunately,
the culture survived the de facto
purge that occurred prior to the
passage of the bill. Since then,
Anishinaabe culture has flour-
ished, in no small part due to the
program at the University.
When Noori first started
learning Ojibwe, it was largely
propagated through tribal elders
who weren't able to write and
whose capacity to teach the lan-
guage was largely unsystematic.
A large part of the Ojibwe revival
was learning how to better teach
it; in this respect, Noori attained
a Ph.D. in Linguistics. Her efforts
to better understand language
comprehension in general has
paid off.
"My kids grew up with the

History through opera
"Italian through Opera" is one
of those high-concept classes
that jumps off the page of the
course catalogue. In any lan-
guage class, one can hardly help
but absorb some of the culture,
through osmosis if nothing else.
According to Italian Prof. Ali-
son Cornish, "Italian through
Opera" goes a step further, build-
ing on the fundamental Italian
language sequence to engage the
culture.
According to Cornish, students
in "Italian through Opera" study
one opera per semester in enough
depth that many of them end up
memorizing large tracts of the
text. Cornish chooses the operas
based on what's available, either
through a local ensemble or the
New York Metropolitan Opera's
national broadcasts. According

other literary and devotional
works, often localizing them by
using vernacular vocabulary to
describe historical events and
concepts.
"They would call Cicero a
knight. Well, Cicero wasn't a
knight - he was a Roman sena-
tor, but it made more sense to the
public," Cornish said.
More than just music
Music is perhaps the best
example of the importance of
the place that careful, directed
and varied use of language has
in culture. Anthropology Prof.
Kelly Askew's work in Swahili
music reveals just as much about
the society she is studying as the
interconnectedness of language
and creativity.
As the founding Director of
the African Studies Center at
the University, Askew started
her eclectic career by studying
music. Her doctoral work took
her to Mombasa, Kenya to study
musical mixing in Indian dias-
poras. While that search proved
fruitless, she found the style and
culture-mixing in which she

was most interested in the sung
Swahili poetry of tarab. In the
syncretic form of tarab, there are
audible Middle Eastern, Indian
and Japanese influences and even
strains of Cuban and American
rock.
Askew is a trained musician
and is cognizant of the amplify-
ing effect music has on poetry.
Tarab is referred to as "sung
poetry," and not simply as a
"song." The poetic structure of
tarab is just as important to the
form as the variegated instru-
mentals.
"There's a very sing-song qual-
ity to it, because the rule in Swa-
hili is that you always stress the
second-to-last syllable," Askew
said.
Askew's work is more than just
musical analysis - tarab music
also serves as a peculiar form
of social cue. At social gather-
ings, musicians play songs from a
well-established canon covering
themes of love, loss and reconcil-
iation. By publically tipping the
musicians, people can send very
pointed and directed messages to
social rivals, all without saying a
word.

"It's not the speaker commu-
nicating through words to a lis-
tener who interprets his words,"
Askew said. "The audience
appropriates the songs, and the
musicians' voicing is almost tan-
gential."
Beginning with the basics
"Learningis only one aspect of
language," Meek said. "Language
involves grammar, acquisition,,
and sociocultural expectations
and practices."
Even though the initial stages
of learning a foreign language are
difficult and, so to speak, foreign,
the courses spotlighted by the
themed semester are an example
of where language learning can
lead. "Italian through Opera"
expects second-year proficiency.
To interpret cuneiform tablets,
one needs to first go through the
laborious process of learning
Sumerian. While language learn-
ing can be drudgery, it opens up
singular and challenging avenues
of creativity.
"Language was chosen
because it epitomizes being
human," Meek said.

Classes like "Italian through Opera" form connections among language, culture and history.

play? We can each think of
someone who emphatically
declares "King Lear" unparal-
leled or picture the reaction-
ary who'declares Shakespeare
a worse playwright than Mar-
lowe. About all we agree on is
that Iago is evil, there are too
many characters named Anto-
nio and "Measure for Measure"
is mislabeled as a comedy. How,
then, do we arrive at those
subjective answers, especially
when we are debating such a
vast number of characters and
plays?
We might think of there
being two distinct threads in
a play's content: characteriza-
tion and plot. Though it would
be foolish to separate the two
completely, we need, for such a
subjective notion as "greatest,"
to delimit our measure. Follow-

ing Dhruv's argument, I will
also make the supposition that
characterization is our focus -
however, I hesitate to describe
any characters as either a pro-
tagonist or antagonist. Rather,
in close examination of the
style of language used by Julius
Caesar, Octavius Caesar, Mar-
cus Brutus and Cassius - with
the notable exception of Mark
Antony - there are many syn-
tactic and semantic similari-
ties. What emerges are similar
characters - which is not to say
they're the same or of stock cre-
ation - who react to the play's
political power plot from their
loci.
Interestingly, these shared
similarities actually create
more pathos in the play. Where-
as in "Othello" we have evil
seemingly corrupting virtue
for an illusive, highly debated
motive, in this play we have
honorable men with the inten-
tions of the greater good in con-

tention. With clear motivation
comes an even crisper message:
the evil of good versus good.
With that message, we might
consider the larger Elizabe-
than context and the issue of
the succession. I won't digress
long, but it is important to jux-
tapose this play against the
waning reign of Good Queen
Bess, considering the problem
of Elizabeth's lack of heir and
Caesar's baroness are more
than coincidental.
"Julius Caesar" is a great
play, but perhaps not for its
"complexity of the human
condition." Instead, it is the
similarities, the shades of grey
and the honor of the Romans
that make the play so power-
fully tragic. Out of that similar
humanity, Shakespeare retells
a perennial allegory of power
and politics, describing corrup-
tion and virtue with complex
realism.
