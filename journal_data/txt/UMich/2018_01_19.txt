One 
LSA 
freshman, 
who 

requested to remain anonymous, 
said he has paid almost $200, 
and will pay about another $400 
in courts costs and up to $1,000 
in probation fees. He also has to 
complete five days of community 
service, and though the student 
foresees a judge accepting his 
plea and giving him six to 12 
months of reporting probation, 
combined with regular drug 
and 
breathalyzer 
tests, 
the 

repercussions aren’t over.

This student has received 

two 
MIPs 
while 
attending 

the University. He grew up 
in Michigan and noted MIPs 
were treated differently in his 
hometown.

“I am from Michigan, and have 

been dealing with the old laws 
since I started drinking in high 
school senior year. In my county, 
one that hasn’t voted a Democrat 
into office since the 1800s, the 
consequences of a MIP were 
much higher than in Washtenaw,” 
he said.

Under previous law, those 

convicted of a MIP could have 
faced heavy fines, community 
service, enrollment in an alcohol 
education program or jail time 
if probation is violated. Now, the 
civil infraction carries a $100 
fine and no court appearance for 
violators, on par with a traffic 
ticket.

New Year’s Day new laws 

governing Minor in Possession 

of Alcohol offenses went into 
effect in Michigan, changing the 
crime from a misdemeanor to a 
civil infraction and reducing the 
penalties for underage across the 
state. The legislation first passed 
the Michigan Senate in the spring 
of 2016 and was signed by Gov. 
Rick Snyder in December 2017.

A blood alcohol content of 0.02 

or above for anyone under 21 years 
old constitutes a violation under 
the law. Though the first offense is 
now a civil infraction, the second 

offense remains a misdemeanor 
punishable by 30 days in jail, a 
$200 fine and a driver’s license 
suspension.

The legislation was sponsored 

by state Sen. Rick Jones, R-Grand 
Ledge, a former policeman. In 
an interview with the Detroit 
Free Press earlier this month, 
Jones said he wants to give young 
people a chance to make a mistake 
without obtaining a criminal 
history.

“As a former police officer, I 

would never try to put something 
in a law that would encourage 
young people to drink. But when 
college students go out to drink, 
they don’t think about committing 
a misdemeanor,” Jones said.

College 
towns 
consistently 

rank among the top districts 
for MIP citations in the state 
of Michigan. According to the 
Michigan State Police, 4,408 
people were charged with an MIP 
in 2016. From 2009-2013, a total 

University of Michigan student 

organization Michigan Pakistanis 
held a vigil Thursday night to 
honor Zainab Ansari, an eight-
year-old girl who was raped and 
murdered in Kasur, Pakistan last 
week. Around 25 students gathered 
on the Diag, which was adorned 
with candles in the shape of the 
Pakistani flag.

Ansari went missing Jan. 4 after 

leaving her home to attend Quranic 
studies. Police officials found her 
body five days later in a trash can. 
Her abuse and murder have set off 
protestsand riots across Pakistan, 
calling for the government to take 
more action to prevent similar 
crimes like this.

LSA senior Muneeb Shaikh, 

president of Michigan Pakistanis, 
noted how Ansari’s murder is not a 
unique case in in Pakistan. She was 
the eighth child who was raped and 
murdered in Kasur this year.

“This is part of a larger problem 

plaguing Pakistan right now,” 
Shaikh said. “There have been 
multiple documents of incidences 
of rape and murder to young girls.”

The vigil began with Shaikh

On 
Thursday 
afternoon, 

Michigan 
State 
University 

announced white supremacist 
Richard Spencer would be 
permitted to speak at the 
university on March 5. This 
decision comes as part of a 
lawsuit against MSU after 
it initially denied Spencer’s 
request to rent space at which 
to 
speak, 
citing 
security 

concerns in the wake of 
the 
white 
supremacist, 

“Unite the Right,” rally in 
Charlottesville, Virginia, in 
which one woman was killed. 
Kyle Bristow, an attorney 
representing Spencer’s team, 
dubbed the decision a victory 
for the “alt-right.”

“This is a resounding First 

Amendment victory for the 
Alt-Right,” Bristow said in 
an interview with the Detroit 
Free 
Press. 
“Left-wing 

censorship of right-wing ideas 
in academia is unacceptable.”

 

In 
a 
statement, 
MSU 

president Lou Anna Simon 
reaffirmed the university’s 
rejection of Spencer’s message 
and said the arrangement of 
the event was intended to 
minimize risk.

“This 
agreement 
was 

based 
on 
the 
university’s 

requirement that the event 
occur on a date and at a 
venue that minimizes the 
risk of violence or disruption 
to 
campus,” 
Simon 
said. 

“The security of our campus 
community remains our top 
priority and all appropriate 
security measures will be 
taken in connection with the 
event. Michigan State rejects 
this 
group’s 
divisive 
and 

racist messages and remains 
committed 
to 
maintaining 

a 
diverse 
campus 
and 

supporting an inclusive, just 
and democratic society.”

MSU 
and 
Spencer’s 

lawyers agreed to a two-hour 
speaking time from 4:30 p.m.

Rankine’s “The White Card” strives to promote lasting conversations on race

Nearly every seat in the Michigan 

Theater’s main auditorium was 
filled Thursday night to hear poet 
and 
essayist 
Claudia 
Rankine 

discuss her transition from print 
to the stage, as part of the Penny 
Stamps Speaker Series.

Rankine was joined onstage by P. 

Carl, an accomplished theater artist, 
who collaborated with Rankine 
to bring her new play, “The White 
Card”, to the Emerson Paramount 

Center in Boston. The play is set to 
premiere on Feb.4.

“The White Card” follows the 

story of Charlotte Cummings, a 
Black artist who visits the home of 
two white prominent art dealers in 
New York City. The tensions that 
unfold around the dinner table 
when Charlotte arrives reflect 
Rankine’s interest in unpacking 
racism in everyday life.

Rankine also spoke about being 

on tour for her New York Times 
best-seller “Citizen: An American 
Lyric,” a collection of poetry that 
reflects racial aggressions in the 

21st century. Rankine noted her 
experience during question and 
answer sessions following her book 
readings were what inspired her 
play.

“The beginning of the process 

really began as I toured with 
‘Citizen’, I got to the point where 
the reading of ‘Citizen’ at these 
readings was the least interesting 
part for me,” Rankine said. “What I 
really wanted to hear was what the 
audience wanted to say.”

According 
to 
Rankine, 
the 

dynamic of these conversations 
elicited the central question of “The 

White Card”.

“That idea, how do you stage 

a conversation around race that 
continues, that doesn’t get shut 
down because of good manners 
or is able to ride the tide of good 
manners, and still come back to the 
questions on the table,” Rankine 
said. “That became the generator for 
‘The White Card’.”

Both Rankine and Carl grappled 

with the challenge of engaging 
theater attendees and maintaining 
an honest discourse of whiteness 
in America while working on “The

Every Friday, one Daily news staffer will give a behind the 
scenes look at one of this week’s stories. This week, LSA 
freshman Remy Farkas covered HuffPost EIC’s lecture at 
the University.

“Interviewing Lydia Polgreen, the editor-in-chief of HuffPost 
was really, really cool. Being in front of somebody who had 
done such amazing journalistic work in the past was quite 
intimidating but after talking to her I was able to really 
understand her concepts and the things that she talked about 
in terms of American identity. I think that her perspective 
is quite interesting. She comes from a very multiultural 
background and her analysis of cureent American times is 
something everyone should consider. Writing the story about 
the symposium at which she spoke allowed me the ability to 
see what journalism could be and how important journalism 
is in today’s day and age.“

spirit ... We are all we need, because the power is the

Own your greatness. We need you. The legacy of Dr. King

Author-activist talks police brutality

Andrea Ritchie says violence against women receives less attention than with men

“What’s the first name that 

comes to mind when you think of 
police brutality?” Andrea Ritchie 
asked a crowd of about fifty people 
Thursday night during her talk 
at the Hatcher Graduate Library 
titled “Invisible No More: Police 
Violence Against Black Women 
and Women of Color”.

Ritchie, 
a 
researcher 
in 

residence at the Social Justice 
Institute of the Barnard Center for 
Research on Women and lawyer, 
is the author of a book bearing 
the same title as her talk. The 
lecture was co-sponsored by the 

Departments of Political Science 
and Women’s Studies. Ritchie 
will also be speaking Friday, Jan 
19. in a day-long event titled “The 
Other America: Still Separate, 
Still Equal”, featuring different 
narratives 
of 
police 
brutality 

among Black Americans.

In 2014, Michael Brown was 

fatally shot by police officer Darren 
Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri. 
Three 
months 
later, 
Tanisha 

Anderson, 
a 
Black 
woman, 

was killed by a police officer in 
Cleveland, Ohio. While responding 
to 
a 
call 
about 
Anderson 

“disturbing the peace,” an officer 
placed Anderson in a “prone 
position,” forcing his knee into 
her back until she was no longer 

breathing. However, Ritchie noted 
this case did not “play the same 
iconic role” as Brown’s case –– a 
fact she attributed to Anderson’s 
gender.

“If we are going to talk about 

police brutality, we need to expand 
our view and deepen our analysis,” 
Ritchie said. 

She then related the experiences 

of other women of color such 
as Nicola Robinson, a pregnant 
woman who was punched in her 
belly by a policeman on her porch, 
and Charnesia Corley, who was 
pulled over for speeding and then 
publicly stripped at the waist. 
These names are part of a long list 
of women who have suffered from 
extreme police brutality.

Ritchie said another major 

issue affecting women is 
sexual mistreatment by police 
officers. What is particularly 
troubling, she said, is the fact 
that over half of the police 
departments in the country 
have no policy about how 
to interact with pregnant 
women.

“While sexual misconduct 

by police is second most 
reported 
after 
police 

brutality, it is not second most 
talked about,” Ritchie said.

She discussed an instance 

in which a woman was 
forced to perform oral sex as 
an ultimatum after a police 
officer convicted her of a 
minor crime: Being in the park 
at night. She cited this as an 
example of “broken window 
policing,” a theory in which 
police use minor crimes in 
order to discriminate against 
certain individuals.

Ritchie further elaborated 

on the stories of other 
victims of police misconduct, 
including 
Asian 
women, 

Middle Eastern women and 
members of the LGBTQ 

community. She remarked on one 
case in which a Black transgender 
man named Juan Evans was 
pulled over for speeding. Having 
left his identification at his office, 
Evans provided the officer with 
his information, which the officer 
accused as false. The officer then 
publically searched Evans in order 
to verify his gender.

When 
Ritchie 
asked 
the 

audience who knew the name 
“Aura Rosser,” just a handful 
raised their hand. Rosser, she told 
the audience, was an artist and 
a mother of three. In 2014, Ann 
Arbor police responded to a call 
from Victor Stephens, Rosser’s 
spouse, 
saying 
Rosser, 
who 

suffered from bipolar disorder, 
was threatening him with a 
knife. Within five to 10 seconds 
of entering the home, one officer 
discharged his taser and the other 
fired his gun, killing Rosser. The 
officers claimed that Rosser had 
charged at them.

“This needs to inform our 

resistance,” Ritchie said.

While she showed pictures of 

Ann Arbor students protesting 
in the aftermath of this tragedy, 
she discussed how this event was 
still not well-known or heavily 
discussed.

Mental 
health 
issues 
are 

prevalent in police brutality cases, 
Ritchie said, affecting half of 
victims in brutality cases.

LSA 
senior 
Nicole 
Miller 

attended the event and was glad to 
see diversity among attendees.

“This is what most excited me 

because in the Black community 
this is what we talk about every 
day,” she said.

Another Alumni Gabe Coleman 

indicated 
his 
gratitude 
after 

hearing Ritchie speak, saying the 
lecture motivated him.

White Card.”

The economics of theater, 

as described by Carl, is often 
centered around the reality that 
the primary consumers of theater 
are white. 

“It has been an interesting 

learning curve for me as an artist 
of trying to figure out how do we 
present this play in a way that 
makes people want to stay in the 
room and have the conversation, 

but also feels real and true,” Carl 
said.

Rankine described the artistic 

negotiation that occurs between 
profitability 
and 
authenticity 

within the theater business. She 
said the amount of thought she 
and her collaborators have given 
this negotiation has been one of 
the most of surprising aspects of 
her creative process.

“So, suddenly, you have this 

thing you are trying to make, and 
you are trying for the thing to be a 
reflection of the life you are living 
and the life you are seeing, but you 
also have to be careful because 

the life possibility of the thing you 
are making is dependent on the 
generosity of the subject of the 
play,” Rankine said. “There is a lot 
of anxiety around that.”

Rackham 
graduate 
student 

Daniella Toosie-Watson, a first-
year fellow in the Helen Zell 
Writers’ Program, said she was 
inspired by Rankine’s willingness 
to engage in dialogue and was 
able to empathize with Rankine 
through her own experiences as a 
writer within the classroom.

Education. Spencer will rent 
the space for $1,650 and 
MSU will provide security 
and ticketing. Spencer will 
provide insurance for the 
event but will not contribute 
to securing the event and will 
not hold any other event on 
MSU’s campus.

March 5 is the first day of 

MSU’s spring break, a time in 

which many students return 
home and are off campus. In 
negotiations regarding the 
pending request from Spencer 
to speak on the University of 
Michigan’s campus, Spencer’s 
team also requested dates 
during the University’s spring 
break. After announcing they 
would begin negotiations in 
November, 
the 
University 

said it would suggest dates to 
Spencer’s team by the end of 
January. 

However, 
that 
doesn’t 

necessarily 
mean 
the 

event would be lacking in 
attendance. In a December 
email shared with the Detroit 
Free Press, Bristow said one 
of the reasons they needed 
a quick response from the 
University was so they would 
have time to make travel 
arrangements for “numerous 
involved parties.”

University 
spokeswoman 

Kim Broekhuizen said that 
there are no updates on 
whether the decision in the 
MSU case will affect U-M’s 
negotiations with Spencer.

informing attendees of these 
recent events and reaffirming 
the purpose of the gathering: To 
honor Ansari’s life and mourn her 
loss. Public Policy senior Ibrahim 
Ijaz, a member of the executive 
board of Michigan Pakistanis, 
gave a speech voicing his sadness 
and highlighting the severity of 
the issue and need for action. He 
thanked the crowd for showing up 
to the vigil the despite the cold.

“It’s important to take time 

and space out of your day to think 
about what’s going on in the 
world,” Ijaz said.

Following 
Ijaz’s 
speech, 

attendees 
participated 
in 
a 

moment of silence to pray or 
reflect. 
LSA 
senior 
Martina 

Cholagh said she appreciated the 
moment for t“We all just prayed, 
or did whatever we thought 
necessary to honor this girl’s life,” 
Cholagh said. “We come from 
different backgrounds, different 
beliefs, but we were able to come 

together to honor this girl’s life 
and basically pray for her. I think 
that was really important.”

Cholagh noted one of the hopes 

of the vigil was to help people view 
the crime with more empathy 
and emotion, rather than simply 
reading about it in the news.

“I think vigils really help in 

bringing a face to the situation, 
acknowledging that this is a 
human being just like any other 
instead of having this senseless 
murder be another number in the 
media,” Cholagh said.

Ijaz’s 
final 
remarks 

emphasized the importance of 
every individual coming together 
to take action in preventing and 
seeking retribution for abuses like 
Ansari’s.

“We cannot just expect justice 

if we’re not harboring it or honing 
it in ourselves first,” Ijaz said. 
“We need to make sure that as 
members of any society that 
we’re in, whether we’re Pakistani 
Americans, whether we come 
from another country, whether 
we’re born in this one, we need to 
act with justice in everything that 
we do, every single day.”

Following 
months 
of 

competition, Amazon released 
a short list of 20 cities Thursday 
as potential locations for its 
second headquarters, “Amazon 
HQ2.” Despite encouragement 
from Mark Schlissel, president 
of the University of Michigan, 
Detroit did not make the list. 

“We’re a research machine 

with 
an 
enormous 
array 

of 
faculty 
doing 
work 
of 

relevance to the types of 
businesses that Amazon is 
in,” Schlissel stated in an 
interview with The Detroit 
News in September. “And, 
we’re a source of educated 
talent 
for 
whom 
Amazon 

here in Michigan might be an 
employer of choice.”

Amazon seeks to invest 

$5 billion into its second 
headquarters 
and 
expects 

the headquarters “to be a 
full 
equal 
to 
our 
Seattle 

headquarters,” CEO Jeff Bezos 
said in a statement. 

Amazon sought locations 

fitting 
specific 
criteria 

including being within two 
miles of a major highway, 
access 
to 
mass 
transit, 

proximity to a top university 
and being within 45 minutes 
of an international airport. 
While 
the 
headquarters 

do not need to be located 
in an urban area, it had to 
meet 
the 
aforementioned 

criteria. An offer of potential 
business incentives such as 
tax exemptions or relocation 
grants 
was 
an 
additional 

consideration Amazon took 
into account.

A location in Michigan, 

specifically near Detroit, fit 
many of these qualifications. 
Amazon HQ2 in Detroit would 
create about 50,000 high-
paying jobs and contribute 
billions of dollars into the 
local economy, according to 
Amazon. The Detroit Mayor’s 
office stated the city would 
be evaluating the potential of 
the office. Gov. Rick Snyder of 
Michigan was a proponent of 
Amazon HQ2 in Detroit.

“Not only is Michigan a top-

10 state for doing business and 
attracting 25 to 34 year-olds, 
our workforce is growing at a 
higher rate than the national 
average and we lead the region 
in 
inbound 
migration 
for 

those with bachelor’s degrees 
or higher,” Snyder said in a 
statement.

Following 
the 

announcement of Amazon’s 
decision 
not 
to 
consider 

Detroit, 
Snyder 
released 

a 
statement 
expressing 

disappointment as well as 
encouragement and excitement 
for Detroit’s future.

“It’s 
disappointing 
we 

will 
not 
be 
welcoming 
a 

new 
Amazon 
headquarters 

to 
Detroit, 
but 
appreciate 

their 
continued 
investment 

and expansion in Michigan, 
including right in the heart of 
our Comeback City,” Snyder 
said. 
“Michigan’s 
spirit 
is 

unstoppable, and so is our 
comeback. This won’t set us 
back- we’re accelerating to the 
next opportunity. We know it’s 
out there.”

Other 
cities 
still 
in 

consideration include Bezos’s 
hometown 
Miami, 
Atlanta 

and Washington, D.C. and its 
metropolitan area. Amazon 
received proposals from 238 
communities and will now 
work with the remaining 20 
locations to decide on the best 
location for the company. A 
final decision is expected in 
2018.

of 38,499 were charged across the 
state, with 401 citations originating 
from Washtenaw County alone.

Enforcement on campus is 

relatively consistent. According 
to Diane Brown, University of 
Michigan Division of Public Safety 
and Security spokeswoman, DPSS 
arrested 172 people for MIPs in 
2017 and 168 people in 2016.

On 
campus, 
Student 
Legal 

Services 
provides 
University 

students with free resources and 
legal assistance as part of their 
tuition. A comprehensive review of 
the change in the law is published 
on their website. Attorney Douglas 
Lewis, director of Student Legal 
Services, said they serve many 
students with MIP charges.

“Under the old law, it was our 

responsibility to make sure that 
(the students) left us without 
having a conviction on their 
records. 
That 
usually 
meant 

paying a fine, working through 
the court’s first offender program 
and the student taking a class 
called ‘basics,’ offered by Health 
Services,” Lewis said.

Though the original MIP law 

included possible jail time for 
multiple 
offenses, 
Lewis 
said 

through the Washtenaw County 
courts, none of his clients ever 
faced jail time.

“Even on second and third 

(offenses), I never saw a person 
sent to jail for a MIP,” he said.

That may be unique to Ann 

Arbor, though. Lewis said the MIP 
law was being unevenly enforced 
across counties, and some courts 
were giving harsher penalties than 

others.

“The old law read that a court 

may give (a violator) a first-
offender program. A lot of courts 
that are in the northern counties 
weren’t giving anybody any first 
offender program. You came in 
with a MIP, you walked out with a 
conviction,” Lewis said.

He 
said 
he 
believes 
one 

motivation behind the new law 
was to instill more consistency 
across all county courts.

“The treatment of the law 

from one county to the next was 
not necessarily uniform, and I 
think the new statute changes 
that. It makes the language much 
more mandatory for the courts to 
follow,” Lewis said.

Brown echoed Lewis’s point 

that MIP charges in Washtenaw 
County 
often 
got 
expunged 

from students’ records, so the 
outcome was effectively like a civil 
infraction — though this was not 
the case in all counties.

“In the county, Washtenaw 

County, the court system had 
in place some protocols to deal 
with 
first-time 
offenders 
for 

alcohol violations that allowed the 
offender to take a number of steps 
and then that particular violation 
often was expunged from their 
record. So the outcomes for first-
time offenders of MIP, in this 
county, likely aren’t going to get a 
lot different in what happens with 
them,” Brown said.

She recognized such a protocol 

for 
getting 
a 
misdemeanor 

expunged was not make available 
in all counties. 

“That kind of active role that the 

court system played in Washtenaw 
County wasn’t duplicative all 
across the state,” Brown said.

In Ann Arbor, the anonymous 

student received his first MIP from 
holding an open container outside 
of a party, and a second MIP for 
drinking in his dorm room. He 
received his second MIP while on 
probation from the first. 

For his first MIP, he had to 

pay $405 and received 50 days 
probation. For his second MIP, 
he admitted wrongdoing under 
the Michigan’s Holmes Youthful 
Trainee Act, which is a way for 
young adults to keep convictions 
off their record.

He 
said 
he 
thinks 
the 

punishments he is facing under 
the old law are unfair given his 
offense, saying the punishment he 
received felt on par with someone 
who got arrested for driving under 
the influence.

“After this whole process is 

done, I will have paid close to two 
grand, and my chances of getting 
a government job are completely 
done. The people I am doing my 
community service with are there 
for stuff like felony assault, DUI 
and home invasion, while I am just 
a college student looking to have 
a good time on the weekends,” he 
said.

Ultimately, no one is sure if the 

change in MIP law will result in 
more or fewer arrests, or affect 
student drinking behaviors.

“I don’t think (the new law) will 

lead to more drinking… College 
students are going to drink no 
matter what,” he said.

Lewis pointed out the effect of 

the law will still depend on how 
police choose to enforce it.

“It’s going to take time to see 

what police do with this. The court 
has come up with a new system 
of dealing with them. Folks can 
simply walk in, pay their ticket and 
leave,” Lewis said.

DeGraff studies variations of 
Creole, a group of languages 
that developed during the rise 
of colonialism. Haitian Creole, 
DeGraff says, is one of the 
most stigmatized languages 
in linguistics. The dialect 
has been called primitive, 
undeveloped 
and 
childish 

by linguistic scholars. This 
perception is common among 
people in Haiti.

Growing 
up, 
DeGraff 

attended a private school 
where 
speaking 
Haitian 

Creole was forbidden.

“I spent the formative years 

of my life being told by parents 
who love me, who want the 
best for me, that Haitian 
Creole is broken French,” he 
said. “If you want to succeed, 
you have to be human. You 
have to speak French.”

Despite the stigma, only 

5 percent of Haitians speak 
French fluently and most of 
the nation use Haitian Creole, 
French remains the primary 
language of instruction in 
schools. 
DeGraff 
believes 

this worsens Haiti’s standing 
when it comes to education. 
The country has a 61 percent 

literacy rate for males and 57 
percent for females, which 
is 
currently 
the 
lowest 

literacy rate in the Western 
Hemisphere. 
Being 
taught 

in French rather than the 
much more prevalent Haitian 
Creole 
creates 
another 

obstacle 
Haitian 
students 

must overcome.

“We didn’t go to school 

to learn math. We didn’t go 
to school to learn physics,” 
DeGraff said. “Kids go to learn 
French. It’s a tough situation. 
How do you convince parents 
that kids can learn French as 
a second language, as well 
as math and physics and 
geography?”

After his lecture, DeGraff 

received a commemorative 
plaque for his scholarship and 
work in social justice from 
the Department of Romance 
Languages and Literatures.

LSA sophomore Dominique 

Witten 
said 
anti-Creole 

prejudice reminded her of 
Ebonics, an American dialect 
spoken 
by 
some 
African 

Americans.

“My mom has actively said, 

‘You need to use standard 
American 
language,’ 
with 

the idea that Ebonics itself 
is a lower grade of English,” 
Witten 
said. 
“I’m 
even 

struggling myself –– would 

I want a school where I’m 
taught everything in ebonics? 
I’m not sure of the answer.”

LSA 
junior 
Mitchel 

Dipzinski said he also found 
similarities between attitudes 
toward Haitian Creole and 
Ebonics.

“Ever 
since 
I 
took 
a 

language 
and 
diversity 

course, it has kind of opened 
my eyes to the education 
system in ways that I didn’t 
think about it before, with 
things like Ebonics and how 
that can affect the people 
learning,” he said. “This just 
solidified more of what I 
want to be an activist for, and 
there’s ground being made.”

DeGraff 
and 
the 
MIT-

Haiti Initiative have hosted 
numerous 
workshops 

promoting the use of Haitian 
Creole in government and 
academics. DeGraff hopes to 
expand Haitians’ access to 
Creole-speaking education.

“Children being taught in a 

different language and being 
told that what you speak at 
home is not a valued language 
is a serious issue,” DeGraff 
said. “It’s a challenge to 
human rights when you have 
schools or administrations 
that use another language for 
discourse.”

N

early two weeks ago, 
Oprah Winfrey gave 
an 
unquestionably 

moving speech, calling on 
leaders — especially those in 
Hollywood— to end a culture 
of 
sexual 
harassment 
and 

assault. Out of this rose the 
#Oprah2020 
hashtag 
along 

with a debate we shouldn’t be 
having: Should Winfrey run 
for president?

The critical thing, though, 

is that celebrities are prepared 
to 
market 
themselves, 
and 

billionaires are prepared to 
ensure their own advantage. 
Barack Obama and George W. 
Bush (that is, Dick Cheney) 
were savvy presidents, to be 
sure, but their early lives and 
careers still weren’t altogether 
different from those of most 
Americans. 
They 
entered 

politics from the (relative) 
ground up, moving from state 
to national politics in a familiar 
pattern — we’re used to leaders 
like them.

I understand that electing 

an “Average American™” is the 
most tired campaign slogan in 
American politics, and beyond 
that, I wouldn’t actually want 
a completely average person 
running the country. That said, 
I think there is a fundamental 
difference 
of 
worldview 

between being a privileged 
child (Bush) or a politician ( 
Hillary Clinton, Obama) and 
being 
fantastically 
wealthy 

and the focus of the media. 
American culture so deifies 
the rich and famous that — 
naturally — their personalities 
change to fit the role.

On the other hand, it’s 

definitely tempting to meet 
Trump with his antithesis: 
resentment 
with 
inclusion, 

ineptitude in business with 
legitimate 
success, 
erratic 

egoism 
with 
a 
ruthlessly 

managed image. Winfrey is 
everything 
effective 
about 

Trump as a marketer, but 
with additional patience and 
a basic level of empathy for 
other people.

She’s 
not, 
however, 
a 

politician. We have no idea 
what her specific policy goals 
are or would be; we don’t 
know how she would act with 
regard to her wealth or the 
wealth of her peer group. 
Any campaign promises and 
candidate 
platforms 
would 

be created in the moment, 
without 
the 
weight 
of 

legislative accomplishments or 
prior lobbying to back them up. 
Winfrey would lack the unique 
political 
savvy 
developed 

by 
many 
other 
candidates 

through 
congressional 
or 

governing experience.

Journalist Derrick Clifton 

wrote in a Vox article last 
week that “(e)ven Winfrey 
isn’t safe from being called on 
to carry America’s burdens. 
Black women are seen as long-
suffering laborers who can 
(be) counted on to carry heavy 
political baggage, despite often 
having the fruits of their labor 
stolen.” We’ve seen similar 
behavior following the election 
of Doug Jones in Alabama, 
where 
Black 
women 
voted 

overwhelmingly in his favor.

If speculation about a run 

from Winfrey continues — 
even though it’s been denied 
by third parties — it’s likely 
because she’s embraced the 
possibility, not because we’ve 
forced her to accept the burden 
of “most powerful person in 
the world.” Winfrey’s status 
as a businesswoman, media 
power and billionaire cloud 
the lens (as described by 
Clifton) used to evaluate the 

way liberals treat Black women 
as a voting bloc.

As part of a discussion over 

whether or not Winfrey should 
run for president, though, I’m 
not sure whether the cultural 
tendency 
Clifton 
indicated 

plays as large a role as some 
would suggest. Billionaires and 
celebrities seem to increasingly 
consider the presidency as part 
of their career trajectories, even 
more so than the entitlement to 
wealth. This is because of our 
collective entertainment with 
a presidential system in which 
brand recognition trumps all 
other factors.

I don’t have a problem with 

Winfrey specifically — she’s 
made comments that should be 
part of our discourse but which 
classic politicians would never 
(rationally) say. This, though, 
is the same justification I get 
when people defend Trump to 
me: He says what he wants, and 
that’s enough. As refreshing as 
it is to watch someone shove 
aside the frustrating traditions 
and 
decorum 
of 
normal 

politics, 
these 
traditions 

do 
serve 
a 
purpose. 
The 

opposition to tradition seen 
in the election of Trump isn’t 
justification enough to discard 
them entirely.

#Oprah2020 is an alluring 

idea because she, in a way, is 
more popular than Hillary 
Clinton, Kamala Harris or 
Bernie Sanders could ever 
be. Furthermore, I’m sure 
she’d perform exceptionally 
well in a campaign against 
Trump — not that this is some 
superhuman feat of strategy 
— because of the eloquence of 
her past speeches, interviews 
and 
public 
performance. 

It’s important to remember, 
though, that campaigning and 
governing are two entirely 
different things, and we need 
candidates that can transition 
between 
the 
roles. 
The 

candidate who opposes Trump 
in 2020 will ultimately have 
to govern, and govern well, if 
they want to win.

 The question of #Oprah2020

HANK MINOR | COLUMN

M

y boyfriend asked me 
recently, “Is there a 
word like ‘bromance’ 

for girls?” And I said, “No, boys are 
the ones who aren’t 
allowed to just have 
friends.”

I said this as a 

thoughtless 
retort, 

and then the truth 
of it sank in. Though 
I’d heard the word 
around me on social 
media, on TV and in 
conversations with 
peers, I had never 
given much thought 
to its implications.

The 
word 
“bromance” 

shows up time and time again 
in headlines. In an article by 
Medical News Today (which 
studies a small, homogenous 
group of men), the author 
argues that bromances are 
making a comeback because 
of a decline in the prevalence 
of homophobia. A bromance 
is supposedly different from 
a regular friendship between 
two men because of a few 
factors, 
namely 
emotional 

intimacy and comfortability 
with 
physical, 
affectionate 

closeness. Both this article 
and one published by Time 
warn that the reemergence 
of 
close 
male 
friendships 

could 
threaten 
romantic, 

heterosexual relationships.

My concern with these articles 

is not (for these purposes, at least) 
the 
wholly 
unrepresentative 

samples 
surveyed 
or 
the 

responses of participants to the 
idea of a bromance. My concern 
is that these articles exist at all. 
Treating male friendships as if 
they are anomalous perpetuates 
the societal mindset that there 
is something wrong with men 
outwardly expressing emotion 
or affection, or finding joy in 
platonic companionships.

Consider 
the 
movie 
genre 

dedicated to telling the stories of 
male friendships, the category 
that produced films like “I Love 
You, Man” or “The Wedding 
Ringer”. The very existence of 
a genre dedicated to portraying 
male friendships as out of the 
ordinary, notable relationships 
takes a normal dynamic and twists 
it. Even in the depiction of close 
male friendships, the jokes are 

often tinged with barbed hints at 
homosexual relationships, which 
use queerness as a punchline; 
in order to encourage male 

friendships, 
it 
seems, 

the genre cannot allow 
same-sex 
romantic 

relationships outside the 
confines of a joke. This 
portrayal enforces the 
idea that awareness of 
the relationship must 
remain at the front of the 
mind and there are lines 
that cannot be crossed. 
Thus the existence of the 
iconically 
problematic 

“no homo.”

Regardless of whether the 

term “bromance” is expressly 
used, what seems to be emerging 
is the idea that it is in some way 
abnormal or progressive for men 
to have close friendships with 
other men. In movies, there is a 
spotlight on the fact that the men 
have an emotional connection. 
The existence of the film is 
predicated on the idea that there 
is amusement to be found in the 
novel notion that men want to talk 
with other men and that they want 
to share experiences and feelings 
with close friends.

Another common theme in 

“bromance” movies is the pitting 
of men against women. The male 
friend must exist for emotional 
support because the woman — 
girlfriend, fiancé or wife — turns 
out to be cruel or have ulterior 
motives. Apparently, as suggested 
by the genre, men get only one 
intimate, emotional relationship; 
they 
must 
choose 
between 

romantic or platonic, between 
woman or man.

I don’t mean to imply that 

I 
think 
there’s 
something 

wrong with representing male 
friendship or that the movie genre 
shouldn’t exist. Representation 

is important; one way to fight 
back against the stigma of close 
male bonds is to show them and 
normalize them — I think there 
are a few programs that do this 
well and allow for sensitivity, 
vulnerability 
and 
genuine 

affection in male friendships (see 
“Scrubs”, “The Flash”, “Stranger 
Things”, among others that I’m 
sure are out there). Treating them 
as a novelty still enforces their 
existence as outside the bounds 
of ordinary relationships.

Representation 
also 
means 

showing that friendships and 
relationships can coexist; there’s 
no reason to have to choose one 
or the other. Male friendships 
shouldn’t be a substitute for a 
romantic 
relationship 
because 

that implies the friendships will 
be abandoned when a romantic 
relationship is found. Rather, each 
relationship should occupy its own 
space and offer its own benefits to 
an emotional well-being.

There isn’t a female equivalent 

for “bromance” because it’s never 
been a question that it’s positive 
and healthy for women to have 
other women to turn to. There 
is no suggestion that intimate 
female friendships undermine the 
value of a romantic relationship. 
Women are allowed their separate 
spheres of relationships; they are 
allowed to cultivate and maintain 
a support group outside of a 
romantic relationship that offers 
meaningful interactions.

I don’t mean to fault men 

for being part of a system. I’m 
not even inherently against the 
word “bromance.” But I think 
it’s important to consider the 
motivation 
behind 
labelling 

male friendships with a word 
other than “friendship.” It’s 
important to consider what 
happens when we treat male 
friendships as unusual. Rather 
than creating a space in which 
men can turn to those with 
similar life experiences and 
perspectives, we create a space 
in which men are expected 
to keep emotions bottled up 
and keep their relationships 
an arm’s length away. Men 
should be allowed to have their 
friendships, untainted.

I 
love 
period 
dramas. 
I 
love everything about them: 
gorgeous cinematography of old 
cities, scores with music I’ve 
come to associate with growing 
up despite it being much before 
my time, transatlantic accents 
when 
appropriate. 
I 
love 
thinking about all of the work 
that goes into making sure 
they’re true to the times they’re 
portraying. It’s fun to trace 
history through the details of a 
story: trying to guess what part 
of a decade a film is set in based 
on the eyeliner and lipstick, on 
the hemlines and hairstyles, 
on whether everything in the 
kitchen is matching pastels or 
eclectic earth-tones, on the 
tiny gestures of femininity or 
chivalry that we’ve grown up 
seeing on big screens.
Basically, 
I 
binge 
“Mad 
Men” and rewatch “Pride and 
Prejudice” like The New Yorker 
is paying me to.
But after watching some of the 
newer cinematic offerings of the 
past couple months, I couldn’t 
help but compare two that have 
almost nothing in common — 
Amazon’s “The Marvelous Mrs. 
Maisel” and “Darkest Hour” — 
precisely for how each handled 
those minute details. I’m talking, 
almost exclusively, about how 
and what we see in the vanity 
mirrors, the cosmetics scattered 
throughout the women’s rooms 
(and, 
of 
course, 
everything 
they metaphorically represent). 
Because I’ve started to tire of 
the easier moves that some of 
these dramas are employing.
“Mrs. Maisel” is set in the 
late 1950s, following the title 
character, 
Midge 
(Rachel 
Brosnahan “House of Cards”), 
a young Jewish housewife who 
discovers a talent for stand-up 
when her gleamingly perfect 
life begins to unravel. “Darkest 
Hour” is a film about Winston 
Churchill that provides, among 
other things, a look into the 
political underside of the plot of 
“Dunkirk.”
“Darkest 
Hour,” 
eerily 
reminiscent in some scenes 
of 
Spielberg’s 
“Lincoln,” 
included two female characters: 

Churchill’s 
secretary, 
a 
complete and unabashed cliché, 
and his wife Clementine, the 
only character who seems to 
truly “get” him. Very limited, 
perfunctory attention was paid 
to the secretary’s lines and 
direction; with Clementine, they 
tried harder. There are a few 
moments where she gets to show 
a glimmer of understanding 
about her husband, typically 
withheld from other people. In 
one scene, we see her sit in front 
of her vanity mirror. She looks 
worn, almost haggard, looking at 

her reflection; her eyes are lined 
with soft charcoal, and face 
powder is lifting a little from 
her skin. Various concealing 
cosmetics are scattered artfully 
around her vanity table. There is 
a quiet sort of grace around her; 
we see her breathe deeply in, out 
— and then she reenters public 
life, wearing a uniform for a 
photo shoot to inspire women to 
do their part.
It was a quietly touching 
scene, but it came nowhere 
near the poignancy it was 
going for simply because we’ve 
seen that exact scene formula 
time and again. An intimate, 
feminized instance of privacy, 
of strength and vulnerability, 
surrounded and framed by the 
accoutrements of femininity or 
“womanhood” — moments like 
those are littered throughout 
period dramas, both the good 
and the bad. They’re easy 
to do, so they’re given more 
weight than they should, and 
because they’re so familiar, 
they’re easily accepted without 

critical examination. They’re 
perfunctory at this point and 
almost self-indulgent.
Part of what I found so 
compelling 
about 
“The 
Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” was 
the funny and fresh take on 
moments like those, portrayed 
in a totally different light. We get 
to see Midge wake up next to her 
husband, Joel, under the sunlight 
that she has strategically let 
shine through her window onto 
her face. She scurries to the 
bathroom, freshens up, undoes 
her hair rollers and applies 
makeup, and then goes back to 
bed and pretends to wake up 
with her alarm. Later on in the 
season, we watch her mother 
do the same thing. They both 
perform their nightly cosmetic 
rituals after their husbands are 
asleep. In one of the episodes, 
when Midge finds herself having 
an impromptu make-out session 
with Joel, she stops him abruptly, 
with a serious look on her face, 
and tells him she has something 
important to tell him. Confused, 
and distracted, Joel urges her to 
spit it out — and she informs him 
that she had spent years secretly 
undoing every other button on 
her corset before having sex so 
that it wouldn’t take him too 
long to do it himself.
These moments are set to 
music, and aren’t at all rushed: 
They’re given the space they 
deserve. 
And 
they’re 
not 
framed didactically — there’s 
no 
disapproving 
shadow 
of 
judgment cast over the women 
who partake in behaviors meant 
to make themselves as appealing 
and faultless to men as possible. 
These scenes breathe.
Both “Maisel” and “Darkest 
Hour” have been criticized for 
some 
historical 
inaccuracies 
(“Darkest Hour” has also been 
criticized on other accounts, 
such as not truly conveying the 
trajectory of the relationship 
between 
Winston 
Churchill 
and the English people), which 
I would be remiss for not 
mentioning. But these moments 
in “Maisel” are so compelling 
that I was willing to forgive 
some of them anyway. 

Whose self-indulgent 
vanity mirror is it, really?

Carlina Duan’s identity in 
‘I Wore My Blackest Hair’

In “I Wore My Blackest 
Hair,” Carlina Duan conjures 
up a richly textured jewel box 
of poems, each one offering 
a glimpse into a world that 
is both lushly strange and 
heartrendingly intimate. These 
poems 
are 
filled 
with 
the 
mystical — a girl transformed 
into a bird, the body conceived 
of as an ocean or a feral animal 
— and the mundane — moons, 
rain, 
teeth, 
cups 
of 
milk. 
Through them, Duan wrestles 
brilliantly with what it means to 
be suspended between cultures, 
continents, ages and the polar 
forces of hope and loss.
Duan, an Ann Arbor native 
who received her BA from the 
University and is currently 
pursuing an MFA at Vanderbilt 
University, wrote most of the 
poems that appear in this book 
for her undergraduate honors 
thesis. The book is in many 
ways a coming of age narrative 
that examines the meaning of 
girlhood, the adventures and 
misadventures of romantic love 
and the attempt to understand, 
as Duan put it in a phone 
interview with The Daily, “Who 
your parents were before they 
were your parents.” Duan says 
that the original inspiration 
for the project was the idea 
of 
girlhood: 
“I 
was 
really 
interested in interrogating that 
idea of girlhood and seeing 
how it could be expanded, 
specifically as someone who 
maybe doesn’t fit this box of 
American girlhood. To me, 
coming of age felt so ripe and 
so essential to what a lot of 

the book ends up being about, 
because of the courage and 
the fear and the rage and the 
adrenaline and the total joy that 
it takes to be able to be inside a 
body and inhabit that space and 
then grow up beyond it.”
Duan is the child of Chinese 
immigrants, and the ambiguity 
of existing between cultures is 
a common thread through many 
of her poems: “I was thinking a 
lot about the uniqueness of being 
born in the United States and yet 
born to immigrant parents, and 
all of the thousand ways that 
my girlhood was influenced. As 
I got older a lot of the questions 
that I had about girlhood 
revolved around that friction 
of 
Chinese 
and 
American 
identity, and wondering when 
I looked around myself in the 
larger world why there were all 
these monolithic boxes of what 
identity was.” In her poems, 
Duan aims to break down those 
boxes and reclaim the liminal 
space between them.
Although 
the 
poems 
in 
this collection were written 
before the 2016 election and 
the 
subsequent 
upswing 
in 
public declarations of American 
xenophobia, 
“I 
Wore 
My 
Blackest Hair” is remarkably 
current in its expression of 
anxiety regarding what it means 
to belong in this country and 
who gets to decide. Although 
Duan doesn’t consider herself a 
political poet, she said that “all 
poetry is inherently political,” 
and believes in “The power of 
poetry to open up windows of 
conversation.” 
Although 
the 
incidents 
of 
blatant 
racism 
depicted in this book are largely 
autobiographical and indicate 
a bleak contemporary reality, 

Duan’s outlook is altogether 
hopeful. 
As 
much 
as 
she 
exposes moments of ugliness, 
she also revels in the beauty of 
connection and the power of 
family and culture.
“This 
book 
is 
definitely 
tapping into a longer ongoing 
conversation of a history of 
violence, but I would also say 
a larger history of love in this 
country, and the attempts and 
the misattempts to love through 
language, or when we fail to use 
language and language becomes 
violence,” Duan said. In these 
poems, many of which code-
switch between English and 
Chinese, language is the most 
powerful force, for both harm 
and healing.
Duan could be considered 
a poet of place; much of this 
collection is set in Ann Arbor, 
and 
Duan 
considers 
her 
hometown “a part of my poetic 
obsession.” But her conception 
of home in these poems is 
complex, 
tied 
not 
only 
to 
physical land but also to webs of 
family and culture and language. 
The poems in this collection are 
concerned as much with place 
as they are with displacement, 
what it means to be severed 
from the people and places 
you love. In her meditations on 
place and displacement, Duan 
plays an emotional note that is 
at once intimately specific and 
surprisingly universal: the need 
for belonging and the longing 
for home. As a whole, “I Wore 
My Blackest Hair” speaks to 
what might be the most human 
of desires: to “love all I love / 
with my wide open mouth / I 
bite down bite down / & keep 
biting I don’t / spit any of it / 
out.”

‘Alone Together’ amuses 
despite its inadequacies

In a world full of brand deals, 
Instagram models, green juice 
and hipster millennials, it’s 
rare to come across originality 
in media. Yet, in a strange turn 
of events, Freeform’s newest 
comedy, “Alone Together,” is 
not only able to accomplish 
that kind of authenticity but 
also simultaneously subvert 
and 
embrace 
mainstream 
L.A. culture. That’s not to 
say, though, that the pilot was 
some immense success, that 
the show fits in on Freeform 
or that “Alone Together” is a 
series for everyone — but hey, 
at least it has some potential.
The series, written by and 
starring 
Esther 
Povitsky 
(“Crazy Ex-Girlfriend”) and 
Benji 
Aflalo 
(“City 
Girl”), 
follows two platonic aspiring 
comedians in their attempts 
at 
adulting, 
navigating 
the conceit of the city and 
constantly dodging the “are 
you two dating?” question. 
The duo — characteristically 
the same person, just different 
genders — makes it through 
the first episode by staying 
loyal and having each other’s 
backs while still calling each 
other out on their bullshit.
A round of applause is most 
definitely in order for Povitsky, 
Aflalo and Eben Russell (“New 
Girl”) 
as 
co-writers. 
The 
sharp one-liners and moments 
of 
pure, 
eccentric 
hilarity 
are somehow able to trump 
the show’s flaws enough to 
persuade me to follow up next 

week. In fact, the writing in 
a show meant to mock the 
status-obsessed 
nature 
of 
young Hollywood is probably 
so spot-on that it seems like 
the script was based on the 
authentic lives of eager stand-

up comedians themselves.
That is, I’m not entirely 
sure that Povitsky and Aflalo 
needed to star in the show as 
well as dream up the humor 
behind it. The delivery of the 
jokes was often too awkward, 
making 
me 
wonder 
how 
much more connected to the 
characters I would feel if the 
acting was more polished and 
nuanced. 
Esther’s 
Cali-girl 
tone and millennial whining 
were exaggerated to the point 
of annoyance, and Benji was 
never truly given a moment to 
shine as anything other than 
Esther’s sidekick and self-
deprecating best friend.
Moreover, “Alone Together” 
just feels majorly out of place 
on Freeform — a network 
that usually contains more 
well-rounded characters and 
investigative storylines. The 
layout of this half-hour comedy 
seemed choppy and jumbled, 
as so many different, wacky 
scenarios took place in such 

a short amount of time. I was 
left feeling a little confused 
and unsure about the show’s 
plot direction. How is it that 
Esther and Benji jump from 
being on the getaway from 
Esther’s 
chaotic 
one-night 
stand to ordering wellness 
shots and spirulina crisps from 
a quintessential L.A. juice bar 
to Esther wanting to become 
an escort in order to boost 
her self-esteem? I’m still not 
following that train of events.
The show itself is unclear 
about its motive as a comedy. 
Is the premise centered on 
two comedians trying to make 
it big in a city of stars, or is it 
focused on Esther and Benji’s 
possible and highly anticipated 
future relationship? Hopefully, 
we’ll find out as the season 
progresses, though I’m not 
entirely sure which run-of-
the-mill route I’d prefer.
In the end, by no means is 
“Alone Together” a show that 
all audiences would welcome 
into their weekly schedules. 
As a matter of fact, I think you 
have to be a social media fiend 
and sometimes a self-doubting 
millennial yourself to truly 
understand and appreciate the 
comedy. The playful banter 
and loving yet brash criticism 
that 
overwhelms 
most 
of 
Esther and Benji’s encounters 
is oddly familiar and twistedly 
endearing for a millennial 
like me. And while the basis 
of the show was cluttered, 
“Alone Together” does enough 
in wittiness and relatability 
in order for me to reconsider 
watching it when in need of 
some mindless TV.

Los Angeles Times Daily Crossword Puzzle

Edited by Rich Norris and Joyce Nichols Lewis

xwordeditor@aol.com

It’s hard to fully grasp just 
how many different events are 
happening on North Campus 
at the School of Music, Theatre 
& Dance. It would be nearly 
impossible for someone to catch 
the 450+ performances the school 
puts on each semester. It can 
be a daunting task for someone 
wanting to experience the talent 
and artistry this University has to 
offer.
Collage hopes to help with that.
By giving each department 
a little time to shine, SMTD’s 
annual Collage Concert provides 
audiences with a little sample of 
all the magic going on within the 
school.
The Collage Concert at the 
University is based off of the 
“Prism 
Concert,” 
a 
tradition 
started at the Eastman School of 
Music that quickly spread to music 
and performing arts schools all 
across the country. Even some 
high schools have taken up the 
challenge. The idea is to surround 
the audience in a “prism” of sound. 
Acts perform back to back, with 
no time in between for applause, 
on different corners and sides of 
the stage. My eyes darted from 
side to side, watching Shakespeare 
turn to bluegrass, beatboxing to 
baroque and Hayden to Hodges.
The 
performances 
were 
powerful. The first and second 
halves were unique in their own 
respects. While neither had a 

distinct theme, aside from the 
fact that the first half featured 
the University’s Symphony Band 
and the second half featured the 
Symphony Orchestra, they both 
felt different. After the Symphony 
Band left audiences in awe with 
their performance of the fourth 
movement of David Maslanka’s 
“Symphony no. 4,” I wasn’t sure 
how the second half could follow 
such a showstopper. But when 
the lights went low for the second 
time, I was swept away by the back 
to back performances that were 
happening all around me.
My favorite set of performances 
came in the second half, with the 
piece “Through Our Eyes” and the 
third movement of Rachmaninoff’s 
Second Symphony. “Through Our 
Eyes” featured students of color 
in a collaborative dance and vocal 
piece, detailing the issues they 
face at the University. Vocalists 
Zion Jackson and Jaime Sharp 
performed sections of spoken 
word as well as a unison melody 
that accompanied both the dancers 
and themselves. In addition to 
these sections of spoken word, 
testimonies from students of color 
at the University rang throughout 
the auditorium. These vocals 
worked in conjunction with a 
group of students from the dance 
department, putting together a 
powerful performance that shook 
the audience to its core.
Whoever 
planned 
Collage 
must have had it out for me, 
because after already feeling 
these 
overwhelming 
emotions 
from “Through Our Eyes,” the 

sheer beauty of Rachmaninoff’s 
“Adagio” 
from 
his 
second 
symphony really did me in. I could 
feel the tears coming as soon as the 
opening melody was played.
However, there were more than 
just tears shed at Collage. Whether 
it was when members of the 
theatre department performed a 
selection from “The Merry Wives 
of Windsor,” or when members of 
the music school reimagined Leroy 
Anderson’s 
“The 
Typewriter” 
with smartphone clicks and dings, 
the audience reacted with laughs, 
giggles and everything in between.
Logistically, 
I 
was 
pretty 
amazed 
by 
how 
well 
this 
performance 
came 
together. 
Getting hundreds of performers 
in the right place at the right time 
can be a difficult task — not to 
mention the sound and lighting 
difficulties that come with it. I 
was surprised at how fast acts 
were able to transition into each 
other, and besides a few lighting 
mistakes, everything looked and 
sounded clean. In a massive space 
like Hill Auditorium, acoustics are 
everything. And although some 
sounds required amplification, 
it was hard to tell when sounds 
were being projected over the 
PA because of how natural it all 
resonated.
It’s always inspiring to see my 
peers share their passions through 
their performances. With so many 
artistic accomplishments being 
made everyday within SMTD, 
the annual Collage Concert does 
an amazing job at sharing a bit of 
these special performances.

‘Paddington 2’ is clever and as sweet as marmalade

The 
first 
“Paddington” 
was quietly dropped in Jan. 
2015, and as an animated film 
released during the first weeks 
of the new year, the smart bet 
was that it was going to be 
awful. A marketing campaign 
that fronted a story ripped 
from any number of “fish out 
of water” kid flicks did nothing 
to help. It came as a welcome, 
genuine surprise that, despite 
its predictable story, the movie 
itself was actually quite good. 
Each scene held an abundance 
of wit, charm and honest-to-
God style that the whole thing 
played like your kid’s first Wes 
Anderson film. The only things 
missing were Bill Murray and 
chain smoking.
It was a victory against all 
odds, yet somehow director 
Paul King (“Bunny and the 
Bull”) and his cast and crew 
have found a way to outdo 
themselves. 
“Paddington 
2” 
exceeds the first film in almost 
every way possible; from its 
unique style to its clever sense 
of humor, everything is stepped 
up. Still, at the core is the 

same beating heart that makes 
it so easy to fall in love with 
Paddington 
(Ben 
Whishaw, 
“Spectre”) and his surrogate 
family, the Browns. If the movie 
that introduced us to them was 
a great kid’s film, then its sequel 

is a great film, period.
Without a doubt, the greatest 
improvement made is the use 
of the human characters. Apart 
from the Browns — the parents 
portrayed 
gamely 
by Hugh 
Bonneville (“Downton Abbey”) 
and Sally Hawkins (“The Shape 
of Water”) — the first film 
didn’t have much in this way 
besides Nicole Kidman (“Lion”) 
playing a villain who is never 
as funny or as lively as the film 
itself. “Paddington 2” has two 
characters who almost steal the 
show from Paddington himself.
The first is Hugh Grant 
(“Florence 
Foster 
Jenkins”) 
as 
Phoenix 
Buchanan, 
a 
former thespian who frames 
Paddington for a theft he 

himself committed. Buchanan’s 
series of increasingly ridiculous 
costumes and personas gives 
Grant the opportunity to ham 
it up, playing opposite himself 
in a nearly self-satirical role. 
This climaxes in the character’s 
final scene, which set an early 
high bar for hilarity in film 
this year. It’s worth noting 
that when “Paddington 2” was 
released in the United Kingdom 
late last year, Grant — as well as 
the script and the film itself — 
was nominated for the BAFTA 
Film Award for Best Supporting 
Actor. Now that it has been 
released in America, it’s easy to 
see why.
The other terrific addition 
is 
Brendan 
Gleeson 
(“Mr. 
Mercedes”) 
as 
Knuckles 
McGinty. Every scene Gleeson 
shares 
with 
Paddington 
is 
filled 
with 
the 
best 
jokes 
“Paddington 2” has to offer, 
from his reaction to Paddington 
shoving a marmalade sandwich 
into his mouth to the reveal 
that he misspelled his name — 
“Nuckle’s” — when tattooing it 
across his fists. Similar to the 
film itself, there’s a beating heart 
at Knuckles’s core, and the very 
real friendship that develops 
between 
the 
curmudgeonly

‘Underground Railroad 
Game’ performances to 
continue this weekend

It is rare that I leave a 
presentation of art — be it a work 
of theater, a museum or a concert 
— and find myself at a loss for 
words. I am usually quick to 
reflect on and dissect what I see, 
able to articulate the emotions 
and 
feelings 
and 
questions 
that 
are 
provoked 
by 
my 
immersed 
experience. 
But 
tonight, 
I 
was 
rendered 
speechless. 
The 
exhilarating, 
intense, 
exhausting 
and 
confrontational 
90 
minutes 
that 
is 
“Underground Railroad 
Game,” 
presented 
at 
Arthur Miller Theatre 
by University Musical 
Society as part of their 
inaugural No Safety Net 
festival, forces audiences 
away from their comfort 
zones 
and 
confronts 
protruding issues of racism in 
ways that are unconventional 
and 
unrelenting. 
The 
real 
magic 
of 
the 
show 
comes 
from its approach. Issues are 
presented and explained in a 
way that makes leaving your 
comfort zone feel natural and 
necessary, rather than abrasive 
or intrusive.
Following the opening scene, 
the audience assumes the role 
of a middle school class being 
taught about the Civil War. Part 
of the lesson plan is to participate 
in “The Underground Railroad 
Game” (a real game played 
in fifth grade by the show’s 
co-star and co-writer, Scott R. 
Sheppard), where students on 
the Union’s side must attempt 
to move Black dolls from safe 
house to safe house — bins in 
each teacher’s classroom — 
without being caught by the 

students on the opposing side: 
the Confederates. In order to 
designate who’s on which team, 
under each audience chair is 
a toy soldier of either blue or 
silver: blue means Union, silver 
means Confederate. Contrary to 
many other works, the audience 
participation in this instance 
felt natural, not tacky, and added 
a personal investment aspect for 
everyone in the room.
While the theme of this game 

is ever-present throughout the 
duration of the performance, 
the two-person piece moves 
beyond 
the 
classroom 
and 
hones in on often unspoken 
issues 
regarding 
mixed-race 
couples, stereotypes, how to 
respond to the “n” word, how 
to teach children about racism 
and 
how 
to 
handle 
racist 
incidents. 
By 
breaking 
the 
“fourth wall,” and the initial 
blanket casting of the audience 
as 12-year-olds, “Underground 
Railroad Game” does a heroic 
job of breaking down difficult 
matters and explaining them 
simply without coming across 
as condescending. Yet, it still 
implores the importance of the 
topics at hand in a way that 
everyone understands.
This, however, is only one 
aspect 
of 
the 
show. 
What 
makes this theatre experience 

remarkable is its multi-layered 
complexity 
and 
absolute 
fearlessness. From full frontal 
nudity and shouted expletives to 
seeing the two characters (and 
their relationship) transform, 
“Underground Railroad Game” 
unapologetically 
presents 
audiences with an experience — 
one they must sit through, learn 
from and internalize.
While it is true that I could 
not find words to describe my 
feelings immediately 
following this glorious 
marathon of a show, I 
was 
overwhelmingly 
curious 
to 
hear 
about other people’s 
experiences 
and 
interpretations. I was 
excited 
to 
engage 
with those around me, 
to convene with the 
newfound community 
of 
people 
who 
shared this powerful 
experience. I was, and 
am, looking forward 
to the conversations that will 
surely take place because of this 
show — important conversations 
that will help people process 
and learn and grow.
The presentation opened the 
No Safety Net festival, a series 
of provocative theater events 
presented by UMS that will take 
place over the next few weeks. If 
“Underground Railroad Game” 
is any indication of what’s to 
come, it is safe to say that No 
Safety Net will be a beautiful, 
necessary and vital source for 
exploration, conversation and 
education.

walks the walk and walks it well 
should be celebrated.

Amid momentum and improvement, Michigan set to face Penn State

The Michigan hockey team 

faced the first real undertaking 
of its 2017-18 campaign on its 
third weekend. The Wolverines 
walked away from that weekend 
in State College, Pa. establishing 
themselves as a conference 
contender by splitting their 
series with Penn State — and 
were just an overtime away 
from sweeping the weekend.

As the 12th-ranked Nittany 

Lions (6-5-3 Big Ten, 13-8-3 
overall) visit Yost Ice Arena 
on Friday and Saturday night, 
almost three months will have 
passed since that last meeting. 
For Michigan, though, it seems 
more like an eternity.

Stemming from their first 

series against Penn State — 
which also opened up Big Ten 
play — the Wolverines (5-7-2, 
10-10-2) gave up an average of 
3.83 goals during a 12-game 
stretch, struggling to solve 
defensive lapses.

But with its performance 

since the calendar flipped over, 
Michigan seems to be taking 
the mantra “new year, new me” 
to heart.

The 
Wolverines 
— 
now 

ranked No. 20 — faced an uphill 
battle after winter break with 
consecutive 
series 
against 

Notre Dame and Minnesota. 
They were largely able to rise to 
the occasion, in more ways than 
one. 

Though depth has been a 

systemic problem for Michigan 
this 
season, 
particularly 

in relation to its defensive 
unit, the blueliners turned a 
noticeable corner against the 
Fighting Irish that was then 
again showcased when facing 
the Golden Gophers.

Part of this can be attributed 

to minimizing unforced errors 
in the defensive zone, but also 
to senior defenseman Cutler 
Martin’s 
return 
to 
health, 

as his reappearance sparked 
competitiveness 
for 
starting 

spots in the lineup. Martin 
played in the Notre Dame series, 
sending sophomore defenseman 
Griffin Luce to the bench, and 
then the following weekend saw 
the reverse.

“Sometimes, 

when 
you’re 

in all the time, 
you 
can 
get 

complacent 
and you can get 
comfortable, 
it’s just human 
nature,” 
said 

Michigan coach 
Mel 
Pearson. 

“And 
I 
think 

with (Griffin), he just needed a 
little bit of a wake-up call. And 
with Cutler (Martin) back, we 
have some flexibility and we 
can do that.”

This competitive atmosphere 

gives Michigan’s blueline more 
options, which will be more 

important 
than 
ever 
when 

squaring off with the Nittany 
Lions — a team possessing the 
most productive attack unit in 
the nation.

In 
sweeping 

then-No. 
9 

Minnesota 
in 

Minneapolis for 
the 
first 
time 

in 41 years last 
weekend, 
the 

Wolverines saw 
contributions 
from all lines, an 
adjustment from 
this 
season’s 

storyline 
of 

the top line of seniors Tony 
Calderone and Dexter Dancs 
and 
junior 
Cooper 
Marody 

bailing out the team. Last 
weekend marked the first time 
the same lines were started in 
consecutive games, and Pearson 
noted that these lines will be 

sticking against Penn State.

Michigan’s 
offense 

demonstrated not only depth 
but also timeliness, jumping 
to early leads within the first 
minute 
and 
a 

half both nights 
against 
the 

Gophers. 
The 

Wolverines never 
relinquished 
their 
edge, 
a 

tactic that will be 
advantageous 
in 

facing the Nittany 
Lions. As a team, 
Penn State leads 
the 
nation 
in 

shots taken per game with 40.1 
and hasn’t had trouble finding 
the net this season.

“You can’t come back when 

you’re 
down 
every 
game,” 

Dancs said. “And I think getting 
a lead against (Penn State) is 
crucial because they are a team 

that gets a lot of shots, they are 
a physical team and they wear 
you down, so getting a hot start 
will be key for us this weekend.”

Regardless 
of 
Michigan’s 

substantial 
weekend 
in 

Minnesota, 
Pearson 
emphasized 
the importance 
of hard work 
this week, and 
how letting up 
on focus could 
be detrimental 
as 
the 
team 

prepares to play 

the Nittany Lions.

“We’re 
not 
good 
enough 

that we can take days off, 
regardless of the good weekend 
we had,” Pearson said. “We 
need everybody and we’ve got 
to work extremely hard for 
everything that we get. We 

can’t just rely on our skill and 
show up and play.”

Michigan — even before these 

changes — gave Penn State a 
run for its money in October. 
But the Nittany Lions have gone 
through a metamorphosis of 
their own.

Penn 
State 
was 
riding 

a 
more 
considerable 
wave 

of 
momentum 
than 
the 

Wolverines, having claimed an 
11-game undefeated streak until 
last Saturday night when Ohio 
State put a stop to the trend.

The offensive powerhouse 

knocks in an average of four 
goals per game and executes 
its power play more effectively 
than 
any 
other 
Big 
Ten 

contender. One of their most 
vital players, junior forward 
Andrew 
Sturtz, 
leads 
the 

Nittany Lions’ offensive efforts 
with 30 points, just a point 
shy of Marody’s contributions 
this season. That’s not to say 
that Penn State’s attack isn’t 
balanced, 
though 
— 
seven 

separate Nittany Lions have 
notched at least 15 points on the 
season. 

Yet, 
though 
both 
teams 

have 
gone 
through 
major 

transformations 
since 
their 

last series, it is more than likely 
that this weekend will present a 
fiercely competitive atmosphere 
similar to the meeting at Pegula 
Ice Arena in October.

Given 
this, 
Pearson 

emphasized the importance of 
Michigan focusing on its own 
development and performance 
more so than that of the Nittany 
Lions.

“We caught them at a time 

when they were struggling with 
their goals against, so they’ve 
improved,” Pearson said. “But 
I think it’s more about us and 
how we’re playing now. And if 
we can do A, B, C and D, then 
we’ll have a good chance to win. 
It’s a coaches’ cliché but it’s so 
true, we’ve got to really worry 
about ourselves and our game 
and what we do well, and if we 
do, we’ll have a chance.”

Penn State 

leads the nation 
in shots taken 

per game.

“We’re not 
good enough 
that we can 
take days off.”

Riding recent hot streak, Lavigne builds confidence

Some athletes have more of a 

margin for error than others. A 
baseball player who gets a hit just 
three times out of 10, for example, 
is considered proficient at the plate.

Hockey goaltenders don’t have 

that same luxury.

“When you’re a goalie, you’re 

judged on your mistakes,” says 
Michigan goaltending coach Steve 
Shields. “That’s it. Nobody cares 
if you’ve made 10 great saves if 
you’ve allowed the goal that cost 
the game.”

This fine line makes confidence 

all the more important for having 
success at the position. In fact, 
Shields, 
a 
former 
Wolverine 

netminder who played 10 years in 
the NHL, believes goaltending is 
“all confidence.”

“In today’s game, you could take 

all 60 college (starting) goalies and 
they would be very similar with 
regards to their skill level,” Shields 
said. “Some of them have more 
confidence and therefore that could 
lead to better focus, it could lead to 
feeling like they’re going to make 
more saves, and ultimately it leads 
to better performance.”

Over his last four games, 

sophomore Hayden Lavigne has 
proven Shields correct with his 
recent solid play, leading to him 
effectively being named Michigan’s 
starter in the process.

Like 
sophomore 
Jack 

LaFontaine, his main competition 
for the No. 1 role, Lavigne has 
displayed flashes of brilliance all 
season. In October, Lavigne made 
42 saves against Penn State — the 
nation’s highest-scoring offense — 
in the hostile road environment of 
Pegula Ice Arena as the Wolverines 
came away with a 5-2 win, a night 
after 
LaFontaine 
stopped 
49 

Penn State attempts. Six weeks 
later, Lavigne denied a slew of 
dangerous Michigan State shots, 
going a perfect 21-for-21 to earn 
the Wolverines’ first shutout of the 
season.

Despite these positives, neither 

LaFontaine nor Lavigne had been 
able to pull away with the starting 
job until recently, even though 
Michigan 
coach 
Mel 
Pearson 

originally wanted to settle on a 
primary goaltender within the 

season’s first two months. Neither 
goalie made more than three 
consecutive 
starts 
during 
the 

season’s first half, while their play 
began to suffer behind a struggling 
defense — the Wolverines gave up 
an average of 4.4 goals per game 
from Nov. 11 to Jan. 2.

But dating back to a Jan. 5 

showdown against then-No. 2 
Notre Dame, Lavigne has allowed 
just two goals per game with an 
elite .926 save percentage, taking 
firm control between the pipes.

“At the beginning of the season 

we saw a good game here and a good 
game there, which obviously isn’t 
enough at this level,” Lavigne said. 
“Recently, I’ve been able to string 
together four pretty solid games 
back-to-back, and that in itself 
leads to a little more confidence 
where I’ve found myself playing a 
little bit farther out, little bit more 
sure of the plays I’m making in net, 
which just kind has led to an overall 
stronger game.”

Much of Shields’ work with the 

Wolverines’ netminders concerns 
the mental aspects of goaltending, 
and thus, their training is more 
individualized 
than 
any 
of 

Michigan’s other position groups. 
For Lavigne, Shields has stressed 
getting back to basics.

“Lately, what we’ve done is we 

just simplified things and gotten 
back to going out early,” Shields said. 
“Making sure that he’s warmed up, 
in the right frame of mind and he’s 
felt some of the repetitive shots that 
goalies build confidence from.”

According to Shields, Lavigne 

possesses a natural, ingrained self-
confidence that some goaltenders 
lack. 
The 
two 
have 
worked 

together to maintain this level of 
self-assurance, allowing Lavigne to 
remain in rhythm even when “puck 
luck” hasn’t gone his way.

“He knows that he’s a good 

athlete, he knows that he can play 
the position,” Shields said. “So it’s 
my responsibility to just to keep 
him in that frame of mind. (It) can 
go the other way when you don’t 
have success, and then you get away 
from what naturally is your level of 
confidence or what you feel you can 
do.

“He’s been really good at sticking 

with it, especially at times where 
he wasn’t getting the bounces and 
not a ton of easy shots to help your 
save percentage and goals-against, 
which are confidence builders. So 
he’s had to do it just gutting it out.”

Lavigne hasn’t necessarily faced 

a barrage of shots during his recent 
hot streak — Minnesota fired just 
two shots at him in the third period 
last Saturday. He’s made 25 saves 
per contest over the last four games, 
slightly below the team average of 
26.4.

So 
while 
it 
may 
sound 

counterintuitive, the high-volume 
offense of Penn State — which 
leads the nation with 40.1 shots per 
game — may prove to be a perfect 
setup for an assertive Lavigne 
this weekend. The Nittany Lions 
have built a reputation based on 
launching pucks from all over 
the offensive zone, rather than 
incisively hunting for grade-A 

chances near the crease.

Against Penn State, Lavigne 

won’t have to constantly “gut it out” 
as he has needed to do recently. He’ll 
be on his toes from the opening 
puck drop until the final horn. 
Many of the attempts the Nittany 
Lions will take this weekend are 
likely to emulate the “repetitive,” 
less dangerous shots Lavigne faces 
during his preparation.

“That kind of gives you a little 

bit more confidence when you get 
shots early and a lot of times they’re 
taking shots that aren’t always 
high-quality 
scoring 
chances,” 

Lavigne said. “So you’re getting 
shots that are from far out and 
are from bad angles, or they’re in 
situations where you can just kind 
of go down and let it hit you and 
(you) don’t really have to make the 
save, which just kind of gives you a 
lot more confidence.

“You start to feel the puck a little 

bit better, which leads to better 
rebound control, and in turn the 
flow of the game starts to feel a little 
bit more calm.”

“Calm” normally isn’t the first 

word you’d use to describe a hockey 
game between Michigan and Penn 
State. In their last meeting, the 
two teams combined to score 16 
goals and take 173 shots on goal 
over two games. That’s not exactly 
the happiest environment for a 
goaltender.

Unless, however, you’re self-

assured, playing your best hockey 
as of late and thrive on high-
pressure situations like this one.

Unless you’re Hayden Lavigne.

Streaking Wolverines 
hosting Fighting Illini

After a devastating overtime 

loss to Ohio State on Jan. 7, the No. 
19 Michigan women’s basketball 
came back with a vengeance.

A few short days after the loss, 

the Wolverines beat Indiana, 
84-79. They followed with an 
exciting overtime victory over 
Nebraska. 
And 
on 
Tuesday, 

Michigan got its chance in a 
rematch against the Buckeyes.

The game was close, as the 

Buckeyes had the lead at the half. 
But in an exciting play in which 
junior 
guard 
Nicole 
Munger 

played point guard and set up 
senior guard Katelyn Flaherty 
for a three-pointer late in the 
third quarter gave Michigan the 
lead, which it held onto for the 
remainder of the game.

The Wolverines are on top of 

the world after bouncing back and 
hope to continue their winning 
streak against Illinois at Crisler 
Center at 6 p.m. on Saturday.

Hallie Thome has hit her stride 

the past few games. She played 
a key role in the first matchup 
against Ohio State, even though 
the Wolverines came up short. In 
the last game against the Buckeyes, 
Thome had 11 rebounds, becoming 
the 16th Wolverine in program 
history with over 600 rebounds.

“It’s really important for us to 

take it one game at a time,” said 
Michigan 
coach 
Kim 
Barnes 

Arico to WTKA. “Obviously we’re 
excited about those two top-25 
victories but we have to concern 
ourselves with Illinois because I 
think the most important piece 

of all this is that our league has 
tremendously improved.”

This is Nancy Fahey’s first 

season coaching Illinois and she 
has an overall record of 9-11 and 
a conference record of 0-6. The 
Fighting Ilini’s leading scorer is 
junior forward Alex Wittinger 
who has scored 277 points on the 
season. Another player to watch 
out for is sophomore Brandi 
Beasley, who tied her career high 
of 19 points against the Spartans 
on Jan. 16 and has 244 points on 
the season. 

Even though Illinois is winless 

in Big Ten play, Barnes Arico still 
wants her team to be prepared for 
anything because the league has 
improved a lot since last season.

“The bottom two teams didn’t 

have any road wins last year and 
maybe six total wins and now 
one was most recently in the top 
25, Rutgers,” Barnes Arico said. 
“And the second one, Nebraska, 
played us into overtime and beat 
ranked Iowa last night, so I think 
our league is better than it’s ever 
been.”

In its most recent game against 

Michigan State, Illinois took the 
lead early on in the first quarter but 
the Spartans fought back. Though 
Illinois held them to just one field 
goal in the fourth quarter, it was 
not enough to close the gap and the 
Spartans came out victorious.

“Illinois is a team that is a really 

improved team as well,” Barnes 
Arico said. “They played Michigan 
State last night in a tough game, 
and we know they’re going to be 
a challenge and I think it’s really 
important for our team to be 
focused on Illinois.”

AARON BAKER/Daily

Kim Barnes Arico believes that the Big Ten has “tremendously improved.”

SHUCKED

LINCOLN – The Michigan 

men’s basketball team ended 
its game with the Nebraska 
crowd chanting its best player’s 
name. They were mocking 
junior forward Moritz Wagner.

The normally brash star had 

no answer. He scored just two 
points all game. So, with the 
crowd openly making fun of 
him, Wagner could only smile 
and shake his head.

It was a particularly bad time 

for the junior to disappear, 
as the Cornhuskers ran away 
with the game, 72-52.

“I 
think 
you 
could 
see 

tonight 
why 
Nebraska 
is, 

what’s their record at home, 
one loss? 11-1, played Kansas 
really well,” said Michigan 
coach John Beilein. “Playing 
small right now, that’s a really 
difficult challenge for people 
to play against right now. … 
We’re playing on really short 
rest. So credit Nebraska for a 
great game plan. They played 
much better than us, and they 
got a W.”

For the second game in a 

row, the Wolverines (5-3 Big 
Ten, 
16-5 
overall) 
needed 

a big second half. For the 
second game in a row, Beilein’s 
team was looking to avoid a 
momentum-damaging loss.

After 
an 
opening 
frame 

where 
Michigan 
could 
do 

nothing right against Nebraska 
(5-3, 14-7), it trailed, 32-21 at 
the break on Thursday.

And though it came back to 

beat Maryland on Monday night 
despite an equally terrible first 
half, this comeback effort fell 
apart quickly.

“We can’t just think we 

can turn it on and off,” said 
redshirt 
sophomore 
guard 

Charles Matthews. “Maryland 
got down and we made a run, 
Maryland came back really 

almost won that game. So we 
can’t just say that when we 
get down we’re automatically 
gonna win the 
game. We have 
to stay poised, 
we 
can’t 
put 

ourselves 
in 

these positions 
anymore.”

After 
the 

Wolverines 
cut the lead to 
eight with 17:26 
left, 
Matthews 

collected 
a 

defensive 
rebound 
off 
a 

missed Cornhusker 3-pointer. 
Matthews 
turned, 
looked 

and threw the ball directly to 

Nebraska forward Isaiah Roby.

Roby drove in, euro-stepped 

around Matthews, and brought 

the lead back to 
double 
digits. 

Then 
Isaac 

Copeland made 
a 
turn-around 

jumper. 
Then 

Evan 
Taylor 

made a pull-up 
jumper. 
Then 

Anton 
Gill 

drilled a corner 
3-pointer.

The rout was 

on, and Michigan was helpless.

“I don’t know what we were 

doing a few time,” Beilein said. 
“And then in the second half 

we get a rebound, we’re down 
eight and we throw it right 
to them. There’s some things 
we’ve 
really 

gotta grow in.

“If you go to 

Texas and win, 
if 
you 
go 
to 

Michigan State 
and win, if you 
go to Iowa and 
win, you don’t 
expect a crowd 
like 
this 
to 

bother you. It’s 
disappointing 
we didn’t play with efficiency 
in the first half, so we had like 
14 points with five minutes to 
go. If you don’t play real smart, 

you’re not gonna score points.”

Nebraska’s defense stifled 

the Wolverines all game. They 

finished with 12 
turnovers, shot 
just 38 percent 
from the field 
— 
22 
percent 

from 
deep 
— 

and 
struggled 

to get anything 
going in one-on-
one 
matchups, 

an area where 
Beilein’s 
team 

can 
sometimes 

expose opponents.

The 
Cornhuskers 
were 

sterling on the offensive end 
as well. They looked to pound 

the ball inside in the first 
half, attacking Wagner on the 
post. It resulted in countless 
easy 
looks 
from 
forwards 

Roby and Copeland and was 
a contributing factor to the 
double-digit, 
halftime 
lead. 

In the second half, things 
opened up for Nebraska. It 
started hitting all its jumpers, 
leaving the Michigan defense 
guessing.

Even when a dunk from 

freshman guard Jordan Poole 
brought the lead back down 
to 12 with 9:08 left, the hope 
of a comeback was fleeting. 
The Cornhuskers hit two free 
throws and a 3-pointer just 
over a minute later to make it a 
17-point gap again.

The 
slow 
starts 
are 

something the Wolverines have 
battled at times throughout the 
season. In most of those games, 
they’ve been able to overcome 
them. With Thursday’s loss, 
though, the trend becomes a 
bit more concerning.

“Concerned, I mean — yeah, 

if you want to say that,” Wagner 
said. “Concerned about our 
offensive 
performance 
in 

general, just the way we were 
careless today with the ball. 
We threw the ball away 12 
times. Eight of them were 
unforced, something like that. 
… Sucks, but we’re going to 
figure it out.”

It 
just 
wasn’t 
the 

Wolverines’ day. Each time 
something 
good 
happened 

for them, momentum would 
almost 
immediately 
swing 

back to Nebraska. Wagner, 
himself had a thunderous 
dunk 
to 
open 
Michigan’s 

scoring in the second half. 
Soon 
after, 
Matthews’ 

turnover turned the tide once 
again.

Michigan’s 
efforts 
were 

ultimately swallowed up in a 
sea of red, chanting Wagner’s 
name long into the night.

Turnovers, poor shooting doom No. 23 Michigan on the road in a 72-52 loss to Nebraska

Michigan has no answer for screen-switching defense

LINCOLN – It’s normally like 

clockwork.

A Michigan guard holds the ball 

outside the 3-point line. Junior 
forward Moritz Wagner runs up 
to set a screen. Against a lot of 
teams, Wagner’s ability to drill a 
shot from deep off the pick-and-
pop makes the incredibly simple 
play near-impossible to guard — 
Maryland coach Mark Turgeon 
said as much after Monday’s game. 
If you hedge on the ball handler, 
Wagner will be wide open. If you 
help too hard on Wagner, the ball 
handler will be headed downhill 
to the basket.

On Thursday night against 

Nebraska, though, it wasn’t that 
easy.

Cornhusker coach Tim Miles 

started forward Isaiah Roby, 
tasking 
him 
with 
defending 

Wagner. Nebraska then switched 
on every ball screen. There was no 
room for the ball handler to attack 
the hoop, and there was no space 

for Wagner to shoot the three.

The 
Wolverines 
had 
no 

response to the defense, and 
Wagner — usually an offensive 
juggernaut — finished with two 
points on 1-for-5 shooting.

“They switched everything. 

On every screen,” said Michigan 
coach John Beilein. “Roby allows 
them to do that. I don’t know if it 
would be successful with the big 
guys, but that’s a thing we’re going 
to see again from many teams. 
And we saw it actually all at the 
end of last year, and we’ve got to 
continue to develop what we do in 
that situation.”

Last season, the play had a more 

obvious solution. The Wolverines 
had Derrick Walton Jr., who could 
simply blow by a bigger defender, 
often making them look silly along 
the way. This year’s team has yet 
to find somebody who can make 
those plays consistently.

Michigan even saw it earlier 

this season against Purdue. And 
though 
the 
defense 
stymied 

Wagner and the rest of the offense 
for a time in that game as well, 

they mounted a comeback with 
their guards hitting 3-pointers 
over top of a mismatched big man.

Against the Cornhuskers, there 

was none of that, as the Wolverines 
shot just 22 percent from deep.

“We 
didn’t 
make 
shots,” 

Wagner said. “We were like, I 
think I saw up there we made 21 
shots today. That’s not a lot for a 
whole basketball game. When you 
don’t make shots they make shots, 
on the road especially, that’s just 
tough, man, you gotta be better 
than that.”

One might think the answer 

is to put Wagner in the post and 
expose the guard who is now 
guarding him. Michigan tried 
that.

Nebraska’s guards played in 

front of Wagner, denying an easy 
entry pass. The few times the 
Wolverines tried to lob it into the 
big man, the help defense was 
waiting to poke the ball away or 
contest the shot.

Another answer would be for 

Michigan’s guards to do their best 
Walton impression and use their 

quickness to generate shots from 
deep or layups at the rim. The 
Wolverines tried that too.

That also led to sloppiness, with 

players missing contested layups, 
getting blocked at the rim or 
simply turning the ball over once 
they got into the lane.

To put it simply, there is no easy 

answer. If there were, as Wagner 
said after the game, “I wouldn’t 
have lost.”

But an answer will have to 

come eventually. While many 
teams don’t have the length and 
versatility of the Cornhuskers, 
like Beilein said, teams are going 
to continue switching screens 
on Wagner until the Wolverines 
prove they can beat it.

It could be any one of these 

solutions. It’s likely a combination 
of all of them.

Either way, the book is out on 

how to defend Michigan. What 
Turgeon said after Monday’s 
game is no longer true. Now, 
Beilein, Wagner and the rest of the 
Wolverines will have to find a way 
to adjust.

Patterson’s eligibility still unknown 

Shea Patterson is already 

the 
most 
highly-anticipated 

quarterback of the Jim Harbaugh 
era, even before taking a snap.

The 
Michigan 
football 

team has played the following 
quarterbacks in Harbaugh’s four 
years at the helm:

A graduate transfer from Iowa 

for 13 games. A now-departed, 
three-star quarterback for 21 
games. A transfer from Houston 
for 17 games. And a redshirt 
freshman for six games.

So it would make sense that the 

former top-ranked quarterback 
in the 2016 recruiting class who 
threw for over 300 yards per 
game and 23 touchdowns in his 
10 starts at Mississippi would 
pique the interest of fans. Pro 
Football Focus graded Patterson 
as the third best quarterback in 
the SEC last year. At a position 
of need, that’s hardly a pedigree 
the Wolverines can afford to turn 
their nose up at. That they even 
pursued Patterson signals less 
a concern about the personnel 
in the program, but a unique 
opportunity to bring a special 
talent in.

No matter how confident 

you are in the development of 
redshirt 
sophomore 
Brandon 

Peters or redshirt freshman 
Dylan McCaffrey, the presence 
of Patterson undoubtedly brings 
a new level of intrigue.

But exactly when he takes 

that anticipated first snap in the 
winged helmet — whether in the 
fall of 2018 or in 2019 — might be 
the preeminent question heading 
toward spring practice. 

Patterson 
transferred 
to 

Michigan in January without 
knowing whether he can even 
play in the upcoming season. 

A transfer from a four-year 

school 
to 
another 
four-year 

school, 
by 
rule, 
requires 
a 

mandated year off. The player 
can practice but not play in 
competitive games until the 
following year.

But it’s a tenuous rule.
According 
to 
the 
NCAA 

website, 
a 
transfer 
from 
a 

four-year school can only be 
immediately eligible at another 

school if he is academically 
eligible and the school files a 
petition to the NCAA, detailing 
grounds for an exception.

According to an email sent 

by Patterson’s lawyer to Land of 
10, Michigan has yet to submit 
the petition to the NCAA. He 
anticipates the NCAA will rule 
on Patterson’s case by the end of 
February, but cautions that the 
timetable remains unclear.

Patterson left Mississippi after 

the program was hit with a bowl 
ban and other sanctions due to 
recruiting violations. Because 
of the ban, seniors were granted 
the freedom to transfer with 
immediate eligibility. 

For 
Patterson 
and 
other 

underclassmen who chose to 
transfer? That’s a gray area.

There 
has 
long 
been 
a 

prevailing sentiment of optimism 
that Patterson and his former 
teammates who also chose to 
transfer — notably, receiver Van 
Jefferson and safety Deontay 
Anderson 
— 
would 
receive 

immediate eligibility. Michigan 
pursued the other two, though 
Jefferson ended up at Florida and 
Anderson at Houston.

Of course, even if Patterson 

does receive eligility, the job 
won’t be handed to him. That’s 
never 
been 
how 
Harbaugh 

operates. 
Given 
McCaffrey’s 

and Peters’ experience in the 
offensive system, it would be a 
fool’s errand to rule either out 
in the inevitable quarterback 
competition. All three have their 
merits.

“The 
only 
thing 
that 

is 
guaranteed 
here 
is 
an 

opportunity,” Harbaugh told the 
media Dec. 20.

But 
Patterson’s 
presence 

immediately 
elevates 
the 

potential at a position that was 
a clear weakness on the 2017-18 
team. 

“There’s always a guy you 

look back at that you didn’t get,” 
tweeted director of recruiting 
Matt Dudek after Patterson’s 
commitment. “Never been so 
happy to get a 2nd chance! Here’s 
to looking forward!”

But whether Dudek and others 

will have to look even further 
forward remains to be seen. For 
now, it’s a waiting game.
