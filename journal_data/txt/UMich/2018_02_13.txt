ACADEMICS

With about two months 

left 
until 
the 
Lecturers’ 

Employee 
Organization’s 

current contract ends on April 
20, the union’s bargaining 
team 
continues 
to 
meet 

weekly 
with 
a 
University 

delegation to negotiate a new 
agreement regarding wages, 
performance 
evaluations 

and other factors. In a closed 
bargaining 
session 
at 
the 

Administrative 
Services 

Building Monday night, the 
University responded to a 
salary 
proposal 
that 
had 

been submitted at the end of 
October, offering an increase 
of $1,000 to the starting pay, 
according to the LEO blog.

Founded 
in 
2003, 
LEO 

represents 
approximately 

1,700 
non-tenure 
faculty 

among 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan’s three campuses. 
LEO’s 
principal 
demands 

include 
better 
pay, 
more 

benefits and improved job 

security.

The University originally 

planned to offer its own 
salary proposal Friday at an 
open bargaining session in 
Dearborn, but the event was 
canceled due to inclement 
weather. A shorter meeting 
was scheduled for Monday to 
make up for lost time.

LEO 
President 
Ian 

Robinson, Lecturer in the 
Sociology Department, said 
the 
University 
delivered 

its response “earlier than 
has typically been the case 
in 
bargaining,” 
a 
change 

he 
regards 
as 
a 
positive 

development.

“The U of M bargaining 

team began by telling us 
that they think the current 
contract is great and they see 
no need to make major changes 
to any of it,” Robinson said. 
“Of course, that’s an opening 
stance, and in bargaining, you 
never start by saying what you 
are prepared to do.”

According 
to 
LEO,

minimum 
salary 
in

University students with invisible illnesses navigate layers of conflicts in class

For 
students 
like 
LSA 

sophomore Sari Grossman, who 
suffers from Crohn’s disease 
— a chronic gastrointestinal 
ailment resulting in frequent 
complications and trips to the 
bathroom — not a moment goes 
by without the thought her 
disease might flare up during 
class or a test. Public Health 
junior 
Madison 
Polay 
has 

similar worries during the day 

while coping with her Type 1 
diabetes. Polay always makes 
sure she carries enough snacks 
just in case her blood sugar 
drops, leaving her dizzy and 
unable to concentrate in class.

“I always make sure I am 

eating 
regularly, 
food 
with 

carbs so my blood (sugar) goes 
up and I try and get it higher so 
my pump isn’t alarming when 
my blood sugar is going low,” 
Polay said. “I have to make 
sure that I am stocked with 
juice boxes and snacks in my 
backpack.”

“Invisible” 
diseases 
that 

afflict 
students, 
including 

Crohn’s, colitis, diabetes, Lyme 
disease, mental health illnesses 
and more, often go unnoticed. 
Many 
of 
these 
diseases 

require students to alter their 
academic routines in order to 
be successful at the University 
of Michigan.

The Office of Services for 

Students 
with 
Disabilities 

helps 
accommodate 
these 

students’ 
needs 
and 
works 

with 
University 
faculty 
to 

ensure 
their 
conditions 
do 

not 
impede 
their 
academic 

abilities 
through 
testing 

accommodations, 
note-taking 

services, real-time translations 
and more. According to the SSD 
2016-2017 annual report, the 
office served 2,708 students, 
14 percent of whom suffer 
from a chronic illness, making 
chronic illness the third most 
common condition seen by SSD.

REMY FARKAS

On Monday night, a group 

of five current and former 
southeastern 
Michigan 

legislators spoke to a crowd 
of about 40 students in the 
Ford School of Public Policy’s 
Annenberg 
Auditorium, 

answering 
questions 
about 

issues 
currently 
affecting 

the University of Michigan 
community. 
Questions 

concerned tuition and housing 
affordability, sexual assault and 
harassment on campus, diversity 
and inclusion on campus, and 
the state of Michigan’s economic 
environment.

In response to a question 

about the 7.2 percent increase 
in the average cost of attending 
a four-year college, panelist 
and state Rep. Adam Zemke, 
D-Ann Arbor, raised the issue 
of state budgetary cuts instead 
of public higher education as a 
contributor to the rising rate of 
tuition. According to Zemke, 
tuition has been rising at the 
same time state aid has been 
decreasing.

“There’s a direct and inverse 

relationship between the time 
when Michigan started de- 
investing the state aid to our 
public universities and the rise 
in tuition,” Zemke said. “And it’s 
literally when I say it’s a direct 
and inverted relationship, the 
line is the same slope in the 
opposite direction.”

State Rep. Yousef Rabhi, 

D-Ann 
Arbor, 
who 
sits 

on 
the 
Higher 
Education 

Subcommittee 
for 
Budget 

Appropriations, 
added 
that 

many 
factors 
contribute 
to 

rising 
tuitions, 
including 
a 

general rise in the cost of living. 
He also expanded on Zemke’s 
comment about state budgetary 
appropriations, 
saying 
state 

appropriation for the University, 
which was cut by 15 percent in 
2011, has not recovered to its 
former levels when adjusting for 
inflation.

“In my ideal world, we 

would go even further than 
that; we would have free public 
universities 
and 
community 

colleges,” Rabhi said.

State Sen. Rebekah Warren, 

D-Ann Arbor, named several 
possible policies that could 
control rising costs or help 
students with financial aid, 
including more comprehensive 
tax 
deductions 
for 
interest 

on loans and a package of 
bills currently in the state 
senate 
intended 
to 
create 

an 
ombudsman, 
an 
official 

dedicated to helping students 
navigate the world of student 
loans.

Warren also discussed her 

work on policy relating to 
campus sexual assault.

“I’ve had the opportunity for 

the last couple years to work 
with first lady Sue Snyder and 
colleagues in both the house and 
the senate on a campus sexual 
assault prevention task force,” 
Warren 
said. 
“We’ve 
been 
Mark 
Hoeltzel, 
a 
former 

University of Michigan pediatric 
rheumatology 
specialist, 
was 

arrested at Detroit Metropolitan 
Airport Monday morning on 
charges of child pornography. He 
was returning from an out-of-
state trip, but has been under FBI 
investigation since December.

Hoeltzel was initially under 

investigation for a two year long 
sexual relationship with one of 
his female patients, who was 
only 17 years old when she began 
receiving care from Hoeltzel for 
her rheumatoid arthritis, while 
also, according to court records, 
having various mental health 
diagnoses. According to records 
unsealed in U.S discrict court, 
Hoetzel gave the patient pain 
pills she didn’t need, talked to her 
about other “hot” female patients 
who were as young as twelve years 
old and visited her apartment for 
sex.

After a house search warrant 

issued on Dec. 11, law enforcement 
officials found a flash drive 
with over 200 images of child 
pornography. Files were created

College Dems, Roosevelt 
Institute call for further

Arbor for full-time lecturers is 
$34,500, $28,300 in Dearborn 
and $27,300 in Flint. LEO’s 
bargaining 
platform 
calls 

for an increase in minimum 
salaries 
and 
measures 
to 

address the pay gap between 
the three campuses.

“U of M is so well off that, 

unlike 
many 
employers, 

they have seldom demanded 
concessions 
— 
i.e., 
lower 

wages 
or 
benefits 
— 
in 

bargaining,” Robinson said. 
“But neither have they been 
eager to pay us better, despite 
our low rate of pay relative to 
K-12 teachers and community 
college faculty.”

Data 
from 
the 
National 

Education Association shows 
that the average salary for 
a 
Michigan 
public 
school 

teacher was $61,560 in 2012.

University spokesman Rick 

Fitzgerald said the University 
and LEO have been working 
to reach an agreement on a 
large number of the proposed 
changes.

“The 
first 
test 
of 
any 

contract is that both sides 
see it as a fair and reasonable 
agreement,” Fitzgerald said. 
“The 
University’s 
overall 

objectives 
are 
to 
have 
a 

contract that is economically 
fair to the lecturers and 
fiscally responsible for the 
University, does not impinge 
on the academic mission of 
the university, and allows 
the 
university 
to 
recruit 

and retain the best possible 
educators for this portion of 
our instructional faculty.”

Fitzgerald 
said 
the 

bargaining 
process 
has 

involved “many hours and 
levels of internal consultation” 
with 
lecturers 
and 
other 

prominent voices across the 

three 
campuses, 
including 

University Human Resources 
and the provosts.

“LEO 
has 
put 
a 
large 

number of proposals on the 
bargaining table this year and 
we are working through those 
proposals 
systematically,” 

Fitzgerald said.

Enhanced 
job 
security 

for entry-level lecturers is 
another LEO’s demand. Of 
the four types of lecturers, 
those designated as Lecturers 
I or Lecturers II primarily 
teach, while Lecturers III 
and Lecturers IV additionally 
perform 
administrative 

duties. Lecturers I tend to be 
the most vulnerable, as they 
have one-semester or one-
year contracts and are paid 
per class. Lecturer II, III or 
IV typically have multi-year 
contracts, and Lecturers III 
and IV are usually paid higher 
than the minimum.

LEO was able to raise the 

minimum 
salary 
when 

they 
negotiated 
their 

first agreement with the 
University 14 years ago, 
and Lecturer I salary has 
increased by 11 percent 
since 
then. 
However, 

Robinson said in the time 
since that deal was struck, 
those gains have eroded 
as prices in 2018 are 34 
percent higher than the 
prices in 2003 due to 
inflation.

“That tells me that LEO 

in those years did not build 
enough power to force the 
admin to do something 
they did not want to do,” 
Robinson said. “And in the 
absence of that power, the 
admin was content to see 
the real income of their 
Lecs go down. This time 
around, 
we’re 
building 

the power to ensure that 
we not only make up the 
ground lost.”

LEO 
has 
amassed 

support for its bargaining 
efforts 
from 
allies, 

using 
the 
hashtag 

#RespectTheLecs.

Central 
Student 

Government 
representative 

Frank 
Guzman, 
an 
LSA 

sophomore, made remarks to 
administration at a meeting on 
Jan. 26, reading aloud a CSG 
resolution that unanimously 
passed in support of LEO’s 
efforts. Guzman said he felt 
compelled to do so because he 
attended a school district in 
California where the teachers 
were “considerably underpaid 
in comparison to surrounding 
cities.”

“I came to the University 

of Michigan to find the same 
issues within the University,” 
Guzman said. “The status 
of the lecturers’ contract is 
definitely of concern to the 

entire student body. These 
are our educators and paying 
them higher wages is a tribute 
to the respect they deserve for 
helping us become the best 
versions of ourselves. Our 
lecturers push us and teach 
and wherever we go we will 
have a part of them with us.”

Robinson 
said 
he 
feels 

“cautiously optimistic” LEO 
and the university will meet 
the bargaining deadline.

“In short, we’re demanding 

big changes,” he said. “But 
over the last 35 years of 
corporatization, U of M — 
and public higher ed more 
generally — has drifted a long 
way from where it ought to 
be, in a number of respects. 
We can’t get back on track 
... without a major course 
correction.”

mobility 
impairments, 
the 

accommodations 
process 
is 

a 
collaborative 
effort 
and 

dependent on communication.

“Accommodations 
are 
95 

percent 
communications,” 

Marshall said. “(We) are taking 
a lot of time to make sure 
(students) are being supported 
in the classroom … and making 
sure that everyone feels good 
about everything; it’s a team 
effort.”

Marshall 
emphasized 

each student’s needs differ. 
When 
evaluating 
students’ 

accommodations, 
she 
looks 

over their medical reports 
from doctors, researches the 
condition 
and 
meets 
with 

students individually.

“I believe that people with 

disabilities know themselves 
best,” Marshall said. “It’s an 
individualistic 
process 
and 

every student is completely 
different than another.”

LSA senior Lauren Kimmel, 

president of the Crohn’s and 
Colitis Student Initiative, said 
she needs the support of the 

SSD in order to schedule her 
IV infusions when she must 
miss 
class. 
Public 
Health 

student Kayla Mandel, former 
president of the organization, 
said students with Crohn’s 
may need to take an exam 
in a separate room close to 
a bathroom and be timed 
separately.

“No 
one 
has 
the 
same 

manifestation of Crohn’s, but 
for me I fear... during an exam 
or a pop quiz, having to run 
to the bathroom and get back 
and having time being called,” 
Mandel said. “(I) fear that 
professors are going to think 
you are acting nefariously.”

According to Mandel, many 

students do not know how to 
receive accommodations for 
their illness.

“(The possible alteration) 

isn’t advertised, you have to 
seek it out. It’s not like the 
University emails me (about 
accommodations),” 
Mandel 

said. “They aren’t going to pull 
that information and inform 
me about it.”

Polay 
is 
not 
registered 

with the SSD and said she 
does not feel that she needs 
the accommodations. While 
taking an exam in a separate 

room would be helpful if she 
needs to check her blood sugar, 
Polay said she is concerned the 
isolated environment would 
harm her performance. Rather, 
she ensures she is prepared 
for an exam by eating before 
and making sure she has extra 
supplies in her backpack.

“I definitely think it would 

be helpful because it would 
take off that extra worry I 
have during an exam,” Polay 
said. “I don’t know if it would 
be beneficial (for me) because I 
just know that if you are ready 
and prepared for something 
and are surrounded by a bunch 
of people you do better than 
when you are just around 
yourself.”

Invisible 
illnesses 
often 

make students worry about 
how 
professors 
and 
other 

students 
perceive 
them 
in 

the 
classroom. 
Many 
of 

these students may have to 
step out of class to go to the 
bathroom 
or 
check 
their 

blood sugar, something that 
may take more time than a 
traditional bathroom break. 
An illness like Crohn’s can also 
deplete a student’s immune 
system, 
making 
recovery 

from a traditional cold more 

challenging.

“On the outside, you can’t 

tell 
if 
they 
are 
physical 

disabilities,” 
Mandel 
said. 

“They 
are 
called 
invisible 

illnesses for a reason, so a 
classmate might think you are 
slacking on something and 
didn’t turn in the assignment 
because you look hungover but 
actually you are recovering 
from a cold you got two weeks 
ago.”

Marshall said she works 

with registered students on 
self-advocacy in the classroom, 
a skill they can also use in 
the professional world in the 
future.

“I 
really 
think 
what’s 

difficult for these students 
is the invisible nature of it, 
and there is the feeling they 
need to prove that they might 
be 
struggling,” 
Marshall 

said. “Even if they might tell 
someone, there is a sense of not 
quite believing the individual 
… 
I 
work 
really 
closely 

with my students on self-
advocacy skills, just because 
it’s something you are going 
to readily need from time to 
time so they have those skills 
readily at hand.”

up to May 17, 2017.

Hoeltzel’s lawyer, Raymond 

Cassar, told The Daily he believes 
the woman’s mental health played 
a role in her relationship with the 
doctor. He also thinks Hoeltzel 
did not have sexual relationships 
with any other patients.

“All we know is some tidbits in 

this complaint about her,” Cassar 
said. “I’m wondering what was 
really going on.” 

Hoeltzel is scheduled for a 

detention hearing on Wednesday, 
where the decision will be made of 
whether to release him on bond, or 
if he will continue his time in jail 
until the case outcome is decided.

Cassar said he thinks it will be 

more beneficial for Hoeltzel to be 
out on bond. 

“He’s going to be of more help 

to me (in this case) if he’s out 
here,” Cassar said. 

Michigan Medicine was made 

aware of this investigation in 
early December and fired him 
from his position. According to a 
statement released by Marschall 
Runge, executive vice president of 
Medical Affairs at the University 

and 
the 
CEO 
of 
Michigan 

Medicine, 
the 
institution 
is 

providing 
all 
resources 
for 

patients to report any concerns, 
as well as fully cooperating with 
Hoetzel’s investigation.

“These are very disturbing and 

serious allegations, and we have 
reached out to our patients to 
inform them of concerns related to 
Dr. Hoeltzel, offer resources and 
provide them with a way to report 
any concerns,” Runge wrote.

Additionally, 
Runge 

reaffirmed Michigan Medicine’s 
prioritization and commitment to 
patient safety.

“Any behaviors we discover 

that risk the safety of our patients 
or employees, or violate state or 
federal law, will be reviewed and 
addressed with the appropriate 
follow up,” the statement reads. 
“In addition, we have retained 
an 
experienced 
national 
law 

firm with expertise in this area 
to investigate this matter. The 
review is ongoing with the goals 
of better understanding the facts 
and circumstances surrounding 
this 
incident, 
identifying 

opportunities for improvement, 
and furthering the mission of the 
University to provide the safest 
and the highest quality patient 
care.”

where to invest their available 
funds. According to the Free 
Press, as much as $4 billion 
of 
the 
University’s 
nearly 

$11 
billion 
endowment 
has 

been invested back into the 
companies of large donors such 
as alumni Sandy Robertson, 
Sam Zell and Stephen Ross. 
The report also claimed the 
amount of oversight over the 
endowment 
has 
decreased 

while the endowment itself 
has increased over the past 
few years. According to the 
University’s 
2017 
Financial 

Report, the endowment has 
increased from $9.7 billion 
in 2016 to the current $10.9 
billion.

In 
response 
to 
the 

investigation, 
University 

President Mark Schlissel wrote 
in an op-ed article published 
by the Free Press that the 
claims about the endowment 
are false and do not reflect 
the 
investment 
materials 

provided by the University. 
The University Public Affairs 
Department 
also 
published 

an explanatory webpage to 
respond to the claims made by 
the Free Press.

“We have said all along that 

our endowment’s purpose is to 
provide 
sustained 
resources 

to support our students and 
academic programs,” Schlissel 
wrote. “Without donor and 
endowment 
support, 
annual 

tuition in Ann Arbor would 
be nearly $6,000 higher per 
student. This success requires 
that we achieve the highest 
returns 
through 
the 
best 

investments.”

In response to the University 

and the endowment claims, the 
resolution sponsored by the 
Roosevelt Institute and College 
Democrats 
is 
particularly 

concerned with how students’ 
tuition is being invested in 
ways that will be beneficial to 
the community of which they 
are a part.

LSA 
junior 
Christopher 

Olson, one of the authors of the 
resolution and co-president of 
the Roosevelt Institute, wrote 
in an email interview that 
investments in companies of 
major donors limit the amount 
the University can use to assist 
students with rising condition 
costs.

“As students we have a 

vested interest in how the 
endowment is used to promote 
the educational excellence of 
this University,” Olson wrote. 
“Conflicts 
of 
interest 
with 

University endowment have the 
potential to reduce the returns 
of the endowment which in 
turn will reduce the money 
which could be used to reduce 

the cost of tuition.”

Public policy junior Lauren 

Schandevel, 
communications 

director of College Democrats, 
wrote in an email interview that 
allowing benefactors to serve 
on the Investment Advisory 
Committee is a large conflict of 
interest for the University.

“Students have a right to 

know where the University 
invests its money, especially 
if its motivation for doing so 
is purely to benefit donors,” 
Schandevel wrote. “It seems 
like common sense that if the 
University 
invests 
in 
your 

business, then you should not 
be permitted to sit on the its 
(sic) 
Investment 
Advisory 

Committee. That is an obvious 
conflict of interest and it not 
only keeps money away from 
programs that truly benefit 
students — like financial aid, 
housing and academic services 
— but it also erodes our trust in 
the institution.”

According to the webpage 

published by Public Affairs, 
including alumni donors in the 
investment process increases 
the efficiency and productivity 
of the committee.

“The fact is, U-M alums are 

some of the top investment 
managers in the nation,” the 
page stated. “We would be 
foolish not to reach out to these 
alumni for their high-level 
advice and, when it fits with 

the 
University’s 
investment 

approach, to invest in their 
well-managed funds. The key 
fact is that all investment 
opportunities get vetted in the 
same fashion and we only invest 
with funds and managers that 
meet our stringent criteria.”

In 
an 
official 
statement 

published on the Roosevelt 
Institute’s Facebook page, the 
two organizations criticized 
the 2 percent — or $218 million 
— the University invests in 
firms owned by members of the 
advisory committee, claiming 
the figure is still a large 
amount 
of 
available 
funds. 

They also mentioned the lack 
of specificity in regard to the 
criteria by which investments 
are considered and the claim 
that tuition would decrease if 
these endowment funds were 
spent at the University instead 
of through investments.

“We 
call 
on 
the 
Board 

of 
Regents 
to 
increase 

transparency 
on 
investment 

decisions and performance, to 
increase their oversight of the 
endowment, to appropriately 
address 
potential 
conflicts 

of interest, and to increase 
annual endowment spending to 
sufficiently serve the University 
community,” 
the 
statement 

read. 
“The 
University’s 

investment 
and 
endowment 

spending decisions have eroded 
our trust in U-M. Instituting 

these reforms would begin to 
restore it.”

University spokesman Rick 

Fitzgerald wrote in an email 
interview the Regents already 
publish approved investments 
on their website, so a call for 
more transparency from the 
Regents is not a reflection of 
the current situation.

“All new investments are 

approved by the Board of 
Regents 
and 
are 
publicly 

available as part of the board 
meeting 
agenda,” 
Fitzgerald 

wrote. “For example, later this 
week Regents will consider 
a $30 million investment in 
Detroit area housing.”

Fitzgerald also mentioned 

the segment of the Public 
Affairs Q&Apertaining to the 
spending of endowment funds. 
The website claims endowment 
funds cannot be spent on any 
area the University sees fit.

“How endowment funds may 

be spent is usually restricted 
by 
the 
donor,” 
the 
Public 

Affairs website read. “Such 
funds can be used only for the 
specific purpose for which the 
endowment was established … 
To ensure continuing support 
for 
future 
generations, 
the 

funds themselves are not spent 
but invested so that part of the 
annual distribution can provide 
a steady flow of dollars each 
year.”

LSA senior Enrique Zalamea, 

president of the University’s 
Chapter of College Republicans, 
stressed this is not a partisan 
issue and that all students 
should come together to ensure 
there are checks and balances 
to the people in power when 
it comes to investing tuition 
dollars.

“It’s not a partisan issue 

for us, we just think that 
the 
University 
needs 
more 

transparency,” Zalamea said.

LSA junior Amanda Delekta, 

vice 
president 
of 
College 

Republicans, voiced concerns 
about the endowment being 
utilized for future investments 
in 
addition 
to 
improving 

current University practices 
and 
lowering 
costs. 
She 

also explained why she is in 
support of a resolution asking 
for more transparency from 
the University on these large 
investments.

“Our motivation as students 

on this campus is to make 
sure tuition is going toward 
investments that best serve 
us, that will best reap rewards 
and create programs for us to 
thrive in and take advantage 
of,” Delekta said. “So I think it’s 
really important to make a more 
transparent system where the 
endowment is being invested 
to best serve students, and I 
don’t know if that’s necessarily 
happening right now.”

able to carve out money in the state 
budget in a time where we haven’t 
had a lot of new programs so it’s 
been exciting to see this as an area of 
bipartisan focus.”

That money has been used to fund 

individual university proposals to 
reduce sexual misconduct on their 
campuses.

She added that the issue went 

to higher societal levels, a topic 
which U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell, 
D-Mich., spoke on as well, alluding 
to the recent national conversation 
sparked by the #MeToo movement 
— a social movement encouraging 
women to come forward about 
sexual 
harassment 
and 
abuse 

they’ve survived.

“We’re at a crossroads in this 

country,” 
Dingell 
said. 
“When 

the #MeToo movement started in 
November, I said at the time that 
there were consequences for too 
many women (for reporting on 
sexual assault). It wasn’t going to be 
real until it was real for the waitress, 
for the factory worker, the lawyer 
trying to be partner or student on 
campus.”

She went on to criticize White 

House officials on all levels for not 
acknowledging the movement and 
the high-profile cases that have 
driven national conversation.

Public Policy senior Stephanie 

Gusching, the chair of government 
relations 
for 
Central 
Student 

Government, said the event was 
intended to bring students into 
dialogue with legislators about 
issues that affect them, and the 
event was successful on this front.

The 
Michigan 
Daily 

interviewed Rupert Allman, the 
executive producer of NPR’s daily 
radio show “1A,” prior to this 
week’s recording of the show at the 
University of Michigan hosted by 
Wallace House. Joshua Johnson, 
NPR’s host of “1A,” will talk 
on “Speak Freely: Debating the 
First Amendment in a Changing 
America.” The recording will 
be held Thursday at Rackham 
Auditorium.

Here are some highlights from 

the interview:

TMD: I want to talk about, 

first, the background of this show. 
It seems really geared toward 
significant issues of our time 
here in the United States — with 
our current political and social 
climate, how have you seen the 
significance of the show change?

Allman: We’re new, we’ve 

only been going a year, so it 
might be a bit early for us to 
make any firm conclusions about 
changing dialogue. I think what 
was important for us when 
we launched the program was 
that we felt that it was going to 
be really important to try and 
provide some vehicle on the air 
or online where we were happy 
to let it go anywhere, but the only 
rule we had was the fact that it 
was going to be done in a way 
where we avoided just people 
shouting at each other. I don’t 

mean we can’t be passionate. 
But it’s really important that 
we wanted to make sure that 
whatever we produced, people 
felt that they’re heard. … I worry 
a lot about the fact that, clearly 
there’s always going to be any 
number of shades of opinion that 
people genuinely feel, no matter 
what their position, they’re being 
heard, and I think that’s where 
we’ve come at the program, at 
least in our first year.

TMD: And what do you hope 

your central audience is?

Allman: It’s a challenging 

one, because to a certain extent 
we’re hoping that we’re part of 
a movement; perhaps people 
discover us really anywhere that 
they choose. Typically, on one 
level, we’re a very traditional 
outfit, a legacy media piece — you 
can hear us on the radio, you can 
tune in when we’re live and all 
of it. But what we’ve been trying 
to do more aggressively is make 
sure that we’re also in front of 
audiences who would never own 
a radio, they wouldn’t know how 
to turn on a radio. There are 
plenty of people who know what 
we do because they only get us 
on their phone, for example, or 
they might sample some of what 
we have through social media 
or something like that. If we’re 
more successful in that area, then 
the argument from our point of 
view is that we’ll hopefully bring 
in people who know nothing 
about public radio. It’s not really 
part of their media diet, and 

we’re kind of introducing them 
into something which hopefully 
would be some kind of area of 
discovery. Through us, they 
might find other things; they 
might find other, different pieces 
that they wouldn’t normally 
consume. I think that’s part of 
the mission; not just to keep us 
across the news, but also feel 
that we’re thinking about how 
we can get our content and our 
conversations in front of people 
who wouldn’t be a traditional 
public radio audience.

TMD: 
Right, 
and 
that 

definitely makes sense because 
a lot of these issues are so 
significant to the general public, 
not just the news mediascape.

Allman: I think you’re right 

— it’s that whole thing about 
who you’re talking to. We’re very 
conscious about preaching to the 
choir, we love the choir; they’re 
great for us, they’re hugely 
supportive, they’re absolutely 
valuable to what we do and are 
truly important to our business 
model, but I think we’re really 
conscious about the idea now 
that there is a very much so 
fragmented media landscape. We 
can’t expect them to come to us; 
it’s about how we aggressively go 
after them.

It’s important that we are 

mobile 
— 
we’re 
a 
national 

program, 
we’re 
based 
in 

Washington, D.C. — but it’s really 
important for us to make sure 
that we, as a new program, get in 
front of new audiences, go to new 

places, try different things out, 
and we’re trying to start to do 
that. It’s going to be a long thing 
for us to successfully do but it’s 
important that we’re asking to be 
mobile because there’s no reason 
why we have to stay in our studio 
environment being comfortable 
inside.

TMD: You’ll be coming to U of 

M to talk about these issues, and 
of course the First Amendment 
and free speech has come up 
quite a bit for the University of 
Michigan, especially recently 
— can you talk about (and this 
also previews the event a bit) the 
role of free speech with regard 
to often controversial speakers 
like Richard Spencer or – we 
also hosted Charles Murray in 
the fall – talk about that role and 
the possibility of them coming to 
campus?

Allman: I’m not here to offer 

definitive answers. I think it 
is a hugely important and very 
complicated subject. I think 
what’s important in terms of what 
we’re planning for this week is I 
think there are peculiarities and 
sensitivities about free speech 
on campus that really is worth 
exploring and is worth finding a 
little bit about — not just where 
we are at the moment, but 
perhaps the direction of travel 
for some of these arguments. 
Because depending where you 
are on the spectrum, you can 
see the debate as it happens 
on campus as being a kind of 
microcosm of the way this debate 

will play out on a much bigger 
field in the next five or 10 years’ 
time. I’m really intrigued to kind 
of sample something which goes 
beyond the little bit of academic 
discourse, if you know what I 
mean. It’s one of those things 
where you feel perhaps there 
may well be generational divides 
in this particular argument, 
that it goes a little bit perhaps 
to what we’ve heard from some 
of the #MeToo discussion, that 
depending on your age and 
circumstance, 
you’re 
clearly 

looking at this in a different 
way, and that thing that really 
fascinates me, of course, is the 
fact that some of the positions 
seemed to be flipped. That those 
who take a particular position 
you would naturally assume 
to be maybe perhaps part of 
a younger demographic, and 
the more conservative, kind of 
intense positions, being someone 
on the older range of things. That 
feels at the moment, that a lot of 
things we’re talking about are 
on their heads, it’s been turned 
topsy-turvy a little bit, and I 
think that’s worthy of discussion. 
… We’re very happy to expose 
some of those raw nerve ends, but 
hopefully push past just all the 
heat and see if some of the debate 
we get into can make us think 
a little bit more broadly about 
where the discussion is going.

A

s a gay man, I’ve heard 
the word “queer” used 
as 
an 
insult 
since 

childhood. The best definition 
I can come up with is to say 
that it is used to describe 
someone who doesn’t uphold 
the same norms of masculinity 
as their straight counterparts. 
The word stung, but I think 
it’s time to have a serious 
conversation discussing the 
future of the word “queer” in 
spaces as it relates to lesbian, 
gay, 
bisexual 
and 
possibly 

transgender individuals.

In having this discussion, I 

understand that I am someone 
who has a lot of privilege 
in LGBTQ spaces; as a gay, 
white male, there are a lot 
of privileges that I hold in 
comparison to many of my 
compatriots. In making this 
argument, I will never try to 
say that all of my experiences 
are the same as people who 
fall outside of the binary 
or have a different sexual 
orientation 
than 
myself; 

however, in terms of activism, 
I see this as a powerful way 
to unite the community in 
shared goals.

In a lot of ways, we can see 

that corporate America has 
begun to be more accepting of 
sexual identity. A favorite store 
of millennials, Target Corp., 
has 76 items for sale under 
their “PRIDE” umbrella. A lot 
of people see this and assume 
the world has become more 
accepting of LGBTQ identities; 
in my mind, these products 
simply give companies another 
marketing 
demographic 
to 

exploit. If you’ll notice, most 
of them talk about “pride” but 
avoid the controversial topics 
about sexuality or identity, or 
fail to acknowledge the tough 
questions or advocacy that 

a company and organization 
should if they’re to engage 
in this kind of profitable 
endeavor. For example, here 
in the state of Michigan, I 
could be fired for being gay, 
and I don’t see Target Corp. 
directly protecting individuals 
against 
sexual-orientation 

discrimination. 
Millions 
of 

Americans are experiencing 
the same thing; we can see 
that this experience is shared 
among a variety of identities 
within the queer community.

These shared experiences 

are why I want to employ 
the 
word 
queer; 
despite 

the 
various 
differences 
in 

our 
marginalization 
and 

experience in the community, 
we should be fighting together 
to 
protect 
people 
from 

workplace 
discrimination, 

to 
make 
it 
obligatory 
for 

insurance companies to cover 
gender-confirmation surgery, 
for 
legal 
protections 
for 

polyamorous relationships and 
various other experiences.

I want to employ the word 

queer to show solidarity with 
other 
identity 
counterparts 

who might be experiencing 
marginalization in ways that 
I am not. The queer rights 
movement did not stop at 
gay marriage. And if I have 
it my way, it will never stop. 
A 
common 
misconception 

of the Stonewall Rebellion, 
according to Henry Abelove, 
is that the idea of liberation 
was to identify as homosexual 
or heterosexual. In actuality, 
it was to remove those titles. 
While I firmly believe everyone 
has a place to belong, I want us 
to aspire to foster a community 
where those identities can 
help us find a home both 
within 
that 
identity 
and 

outside of it, into the broader 

queer community and beyond. 
There may not be a path to 
this in the immediate future, 
but I think this argument of 
employing the word queer 
needs to be a larger focus 
in the discussions about the 
community. Trans-inclusivity 
into the LGBTQ community 
needs to be stronger and the 
issues of trans individuals 
need to be centered in these 
discussions, because I envision 
a community where the most 
marginalized can be the ones 
I stand in solidarity with and 
assist in any way I can.

As an aside, I’m not here 

to use the word for straight 
cis-peoples’ comfort. I don’t 
care if it makes one of those 
individuals uncomfortable in 
using the phrase. I’m here to 
be a gay man who identifies 
as being a part of the queer 
community. And I hope that 
many of us can aspire to do 
the same.

I can think of no better 

word 
to 
describe 
the 

community 
than 
the 
one 

which was employed when I 
was a kid. When I was younger, 
it 
would 
symbolize 
when 

someone was doing something 
outside of the gender norms 
that we follow on a day-to-day 
basis. I want to fall outside of 
those norms, though. I have no 
interest in being a part of the 
structures that have caused 
myself and so many of my peers 
to be marginalized. I aspire 
to reclaim the word queer in 
an attempt to show that we 
don’t need to fall in line with 
the negative connotations this 
word initially imposed.

Economically, 
the 

Republican-driven 
bill 

restructures loan repayment 
plans and removes Public 
Service 
Loan 
Forgiveness. 

These changes make it more 
difficult for undergraduate 
and 
graduate 
students 
by 

making it more difficult to 
receive financial aid because 
of 
PROSPER’s 
redeveloped 

loan limit. The bill also calls 
for the elimination of Stafford 
and PLUS loans, replacing the 
varying options with a singular 
Federal ONE Loan program.

These 
Federal 
ONE 

Loans give students differing 
borrowing limits, depending 
on their financial situation; 
dependent 
undergraduate 

students are able to borrow 
$39,000 in federal student 
loans, 
and 
independent 

undergraduate 
students 

have a $60,250 lifetime cap. 
Repayment options are also 
being restricted, with only 
two 
new 
repayment 
plans 

that are the standard 10-year 
plans. These limiting actions, 
in addition to the phasing out 
of all federal grant programs 
(excluding the PELL grant), 
have the potential to widen the 
education disparity between 
socioeconomic 
groups 
and 

lessen the educational options 
available 
to 
lower-income 

students. The loss of options, 
aid and change in loan caps 
ultimately restrict students and 
make the pursuit of graduate 
education less attainable.

In addition to monetary 

changes, 
PROSPER 
also 

includes 
many 
social 

restrictions 
that 
could 

leave 
students 
fearing 

discrimination. 
There 
are 

explicit 
provisions 
within 

the bill about freedom of 
expression 
and 
religion, 

which will make it so that 
no 
government 
institution 

is able to take action against 
an 
institution 
of 
higher 

education 
that 
is 
acting 

within “its religious mission.” 
This 
has 
prompted 
many 

LGBTQ 
advocates 
to 
fear 

legal 
discrimination 
based 

on 
sexual 
orientation 
and 

gender identity. The fear of 
discrimination acts as a barrier 
for students deciding to which 
schools to apply, limiting their 
education options.

The bill allows private 

institutions 
to 
receive 

federal funding regardless of 
whether or not they institute 
discriminatory 
practices. 

The provisions also allow for 
discrimination at the public 
level, as student organizations 
could undermine a university’s 
anti-discrimination 
policies 

due to their own beliefs and 
determination of freedom of 
expression. And finally, the 
focus on freedom of speech 
within 
PROSPER 
could 

possibly make it even easier 
for controversial speakers to 
reach campuses, leading to 
social tensions and higher 
potential for security risks, 
putting the safety of college 
students into question.

In addition to economic 

and 
social 
provisions, 

PROSPER also comments on 
due process in a manner that 
undermines 
sexual 
assault 

policies on campuses across 

the nation. With a focus 
on 
sexual 
assault 
within 

PROSPER, 
the 
bill 
allows 

institutions to set their own 
standards for evidence when 
investigating 
accusations. 

Institutions could, therefore, 
have the right to introduce 
greater criminal standards, 
possibly “beyond a reasonable 
doubt” — the standard of 
proof required in criminal 
cases 
— 
rather 
than 
the 

“preponderance of evidence” 
standard previously required 
by the Obama administration. 
This 
allows 
for 
more 

opportunity 
for 
victim 

shaming, longer trial times and 
the undermining of survivors’ 
accusations. And, this again 
affects 
LGBTQ 
students 

disproportionately, 
as 
they 

are more susceptible to sexual 
assault and less likely to report 
their experiences. This could 
ultimately impact the number 
of student survivors who come 
forward and the concern given 
for those who do.

The 
PROSPER 
Act 
is 

a bill that hurts current, 
future, 
undergraduate 
and 

graduate students by directly 
affecting 
their 
experience 

and 
safety 
within 
their 

college 
environment, 
while 

also limiting the choices they 
have when applying for higher 
education. The Michigan Daily 
Editorial Board calls upon the 
University of Michigan to lobby 
against this bill when the time 
comes as it is not conducive to 
our values of equal opportunity 
and anti-discrimination.

Lobby against PROSPER Act 

N

ews broke last week 
that the Pentagon is 
in the early stages of 

planning a large military parade 
in Washington, D.C. after being 
directed to do so by President 
Donald 
Trump. 
The 
Trump 

administration has long desired 
a military parade. It reportedly 
hoped to organize one for Trump’s 
inauguration and the interest was 
rekindled after watching France’s 
Bastille 
Day 
military 
parade. 

At some point in late January, 
Trump’s interest in a grand 
military spectacle became an 
order, and the parade is reportedly 
being planned at the “highest levels 
of the military.”
 News of the parade elicited 
criticism from both sides of the 
aisle, and retired military leaders 
have also expressed opposition. 
Legislation has been introduced 
to 
restrict 
appropriations 
for 

any 
parade, 
but 
Republican 

congressional leaders will likely 
block it from even coming to a vote 
to avoid embarrassing the Trump 
administration. The parade is 
likely to proceed regardless of 
the criticism, and the White 
House has confirmed planning 
is underway, with possible dates 
including the Fourth of July or 
Veteran’s Day.
 If executed properly, a military 
parade could serve as a fitting and 
deserved tribute to our troops and 
armed services. However, because 
such a parade is unfortunately 
more likely to manifest itself as 
a politicized show of military 
force, it is difficult to envision the 
parade’s advantages exceeding its 
potential drawbacks.
 The most obvious of these 
drawbacks is cost. It is estimated a 
military parade will cost millions 
of dollars at minimum, and one of 
the scale that Trump desires will 
likely cost several million more. 
The steep price tag comes from 
costs associated with transporting 
military equipment and vehicles to 
Washington, D.C. and the massive 

security costs the parade will 
surely entail. The last time the U.S. 
held a military parade was 1991 
to celebrate victory in the Gulf 
War. That parade cost $12 million, 
would be $21.6 million today when 
adjusted for inflation.
 Furthermore, the parade could 
cause damage to D.C.’s roads, 
which are not designed to support 
vehicles as heavy as the tanks and 
armored vehicles that will be 
featured. In the 1991 parade, tank 
tracks punched holes through 
the capital city’s boulevards. 
That 1991 parade also caused 
extensive damage to a sculpture 
garden when the air blast of 
low-flying helicopters showered 
the exhibits with pebbles. Such 
a freak accident will not likely 
be repeated in Trump’s parade 
but underscores the hazards of 
holding military spectacles in 
civilian settings.
 
 
Another 
concern 
is 
the 

disconcerting optics of a military 
parade through the nation’s capital. 
Some democratic countries do 
hold military parades; the Bastille 
Day celebrations that inspired 
Trump are an example. However, 
there is no denying that grand 
displays of military strength evoke 
connotations 
of 
authoritarian 

regimes like North Korea, China 
and Russia, where demonstrations 
of force serve to dissuade dissent, 
prop up autocratic rulers and 
intimidate 
adversaries. 
Several 

retired 
generals 
have 
raised 

concerns that military parades 
go against American democratic 
traditions. Robert O’Neill, the 
former Navy SEAL who claims 
to have fired the shots that killed 
Bin Laden, concurred and likened 
the idea of a military parade to 
autocracy in colorful language.
 Perhaps the authoritarian optics 
could be easily overlooked under 
another president, but the reality is 
that Trump has earned a reputation 
for admiring despotism, making 
the optics of a military parade 
through Washington, D.C. all the 

more unsettling. For example, 
Trump has previously expressed 
respect for Russian President 
Vladimir Putin’s leadership and 
praised former Iraqi President 
Saddam Hussein’s brutal internal 
security 
policies. 
Around 
the 

same time news of the parade 
surfaced, Trump called Democrats 
in Congress “treasonous” for not 
clapping during parts of his State 
of the Union address, an accusation 
that is both false and grossly 
inappropriate in a democratic 
government. 
These 
statements 

create the persona of a man craving 
power 
and 
genuinely 
hostile 

toward his opposition. This image 
is entirely self-inflicted and, fairly 
or unfairly, is reinforced by Trump 
ordering the Pentagon to organize 
a military parade.
 The White House is marketing 
the parade as a celebration of 
the armed forces and veterans. 
Veterans are certainly worthy of 
the honor of a parade, but there 
are far better ways to thank 
them for their service. Instead 
of spending tens of millions on a 
lavish and ultimately meaningless 
military parade, spend that money 
on veterans’ health care, job 
placement, disability benefits or 
suicide prevention.
 Amid these far more important 
issues, it becomes clear that 
Trump’s parade serves merely 
as a distraction from real policy 
measures, foreign and domestic. 
For 
Trump 
and 
his 
dismal 

approval ratings, perhaps this 
distraction will be welcomed; 
but for the American people, 
a 
military 
parade 
through 

Washington, D.C. is nothing more 
than an unsightly and extravagant 
waste of time and money. With 
the fate of Trump’s parade in the 
hands of the White House and the 
Pentagon, we can only hope that 
his parade of indulgence does not 
come to fruition.

A pointless parade

FROM THE DAILY

A 

higher education bill, known as the PROSPER Act, has been passed 
through committee and is awaiting consideration by the House 
of Representatives. PROSPER, which stands for “Promoting Real 

Opportunity, Success, and Prosperity Through Education Reform,” is 
intended to reassert and amend the 1965 Higher Education Act, with a 
strong focus on the processes by which students pay for higher education 
and the regulations on free speech and assembly within these institutions. 
The Michigan Daily Editorial Board feels that the provisions of the bill hurt 
students pursuing higher education financially and socially, as well as in 
regard to their safety. There are serious problems within the current bill, 
which should not be passed without significant amendments.

During last year’s Oscars, I 

can remember myself frozen 
in my seat, awaiting the results 
for best picture. Between a 
texting battle with my mom — 
a hopeless romantic rooting for 
“La La Land” — I kept repeating 
to myself “Please don’t let it 
win.” When Barry Jenkins’s 
“Moonlight” 
actually 
won 

for Best Picture (minus the 
momentary switched-envelope 
screw up), I froze again, this 
time with a smile on my face, 
ecstatic for a win that I thought 
was merited but not expected.

I had a similar feeling of being 

stopped in time, unable to move, 
after I watched Sean Baker’s 
“The Florida Project.” I sat 
there still in my seat, incapable 
or processing what I had seen. 
I was in awe and enamored. 

Overwhelmed. And prior to 
nominations, it appeared like 
others felt the same way; Baker 
won for Best Director at the 
New York Film Critics Circle 

Awards, which was a prelude to 
Barry Jenkins’s eventual Oscar 
triumph.

“The 
Florida 
Project” 

should have been this year’s 
“Moonlight.” The film traces 
Moonee, an independent and 
spunky 8-year-old resident of 
Orlando’s Magic Castle, a cluster 
of lilac project homes, as she 
goes on adventures and learns 
that life isn’t as magical as she 
thought it was. Both films are 
indeed quite similar — they tell 
stories that are rarely told. They 
both expose a pocket of hidden 
America, specifically Fla., that 
has escaped popular American 
consciousness — whether it be 
the poverty on the outskirts of 
Disney World, or the struggle 
of being Black and gay in an 
underprivileged neighborhood. 
They both confront ugly themes 
beautifully, 
with 
masterful 

cinematography that is unique 
and stands out as their own kind 
of character. Both directors find 
ways to use color and nature and 
give them symbolism while still 
sticking to their urban, poverty-

Oscar Snubs: ‘The Florida 
Project’ deserved better

FILM NOTEBOOK

DAILY FOOD COLUMN

I 
will 
henceforth 
settle 

the greatest dispute from my 
childhood once and for all: Dad, 
I love you, but Uncle Bobby is 
a better cook. While I’m at it 
— when it comes to meatballs, 
his are better. I’m going to 
throw Mom under the bus here, 
because she agrees with me. 
Bobby Rallo is the king of the 
meatball — the messiah of the 
coveted Italian side dish. And I 
know it hurts to hear it, but the 
man deserves some praise.

My uncle cooks with his 

whole soul. It’s a beautiful and 
understated way to cook, in a 
world where commercial chefs 
and big business dominate the 
American food industry, taking 
us away from the foundations 
that our love for food stems 
from. I think every foodie and 
chef alike has an origin story 
— a moment or a meal where 
they knew their heart and their 
hands were made for a kitchen.

When thinking of where my 

love for good food and cooking 
came from, I always start at my 
base. I was born into a family 
with a strong background in 
Italian cooking — beginning 
in the early 1900s in coastal 
Sicily and growing all the way 
to Red Bank, New Jersey. The 
faces and times have changed 
but the recipes have not. The 
passion has not. When I was 
little, my uncle owned a classic 
Italian place called “Rallo’s.” 
It has since closed, but if I 
could name five of my favorite 
places to eat in the world, it 
may be number three (behind 
II Vecchio Mulino in Sardinia, 
Italy — get the bucatini — and 
Le Bernadin in New York — 
have anything, and make sure 
you don’t have to take care of 
the bill).

At Rallo’s, my uncle would 

always be in the kitchen, which 
is a rare place for a restaurateur 
who normally mans the front 
of the house or walks around 
intimidatingly. 
But 
Bobby 

Rallo’s heart is in the kitchen 
and when he makes a kitchen 
his, it’s something like magic. 
I would burst through the 
aluminum doors of Rallo’s 
kitchen and he’d be behind the 
grill — white t-shirt, stained 
with a smear of oil and a splash 
of fresh Jersey tomato sauce, 
white apron — covered in pizza 
flour and pork chop grease.

If you’re not willing to get 

messy in the kitchen, then 
cooking isn’t for you.

I’d sit on the counter and 

he’d 
break 
off 
chunks 
of 

parmigiano 
reggiano 
and 

salami, prosciutto and sweet 
little cherry tomatoes, handing 
them to me as he flipped dough 
and stirred sauce. A chunk of 
soft Italian baguette with a 
little olive oil and rosemary. 
A traveling charcuterie, if you 
will — one for a duo always 
on the move. I would watch 
while he cooked, and even 
better, watch his face when 
he’d break from the flame and 
the daunting task of stuffing 
ravioli to bring a plate to a 
customer. If I had to describe 
my Uncle Bobby, that’d be the 
picture. Leaving the kitchen 

to bring someone something 
he made with his hands, and 
watching their eyes and their 
face as they take the first bite. 
It’s a gratitude of sorts.

Our similar love for food, 

spontaneity and the literature 
of the 1960s make us quite the 
pair. We always make the point 
to go on some sort of lunch 
endeavor every few weeks, and 
our growing list of favorites 
include boardwalk tacos and 
nutella pizzas.

The 
distance 
between 

suburban 
New 
Jersey 
and 

Mich. gives me a lot of things to 
miss, but these lunch dates are 
one of the things I miss most 
(also his lending of worn copies 
of Kerouac and spontaneous 
donut deliveries). In perfect 
Bobby fashion, he proposed 
we 
keep 
the 
lunch 
dates 

alive in an unconventional 
albeit 
charming 
way. 
The 

proposition: I’d go to lunch 

somewhere 
in 
Ann 
Arbor 

(with good company) and eat 
something delicious, strange, 
greasy, fattening, and I’d call 
him afterwards, describe the 
experience, and he’d cook the 
very same meal from home, eat 
it and then we’d talk about it. 
This is one of the best ideas he’s 
ever had, and not letting the 
throngs of distance split apart 
such an important part of who 
I am blew up with potential.

A lunch date from 1,000 

miles away.

The first place I chose was 

somewhere I knew would spark 
delicious conversation and fit 
with the simple yet traditional 
nature of my Uncle’s palate. 
Monahan’s Seafood Market in 
Kerrytown was the spot — and 
my best friend was the company. 
Monahan’s is one of the perfect 
little quirks of the world, 
situated 
in 
the 
Kerrytown 

markets in a sequestered yet 
quaint corner. It has been in 
business for nearly 40 years, 
and is an understated yet 
brilliant joy. I ordered the 
fried fish sandwich — a pile of 
fresh fried cod, sandwiched 
between a perfectly soft roll, 
accompanied 
with 
lettuce, 

tomato, red onion and an 

undefinable 
yet 
incredible 

sauce. My sandwich experience 
was wonderful. I split a side of 
cajun fries with my best friend 
and we talked about the fact 
that we trekked through the 
arctic tundra for a sandwich, 
and we laughed a lot.

I called my uncle later 

that day and he said he’d be 
back to me with his sandwich 
experience by that night. When 
he called me on the phone, I 
felt like I was looking at him 
across the table of one of our 
favorite 
pizza 
restaurants 

from all the way over here in 
Mich. Bobby made himself a 
locally caught New Jersey fried 
flounder sandwich between a 
Balthazar roll (which he says 
is the true magic ingredient 
— crunchy on the outside, soft 
on the inside), accompanied 
with romaine lettuce, tomato, 
Sicilian olive oil, red wine 
vinegar and oregano. After we 
talked logistics, there was a 
pause in the conversation.

“It’s funny you chose a fish 

sandwich,” he said with a 
nostalgia I recognized, and I 
knew it was time for one of the 
stories of his that I cherish so 
greatly.

“I am a curator of visual 

nuggets from the past — a fried 
fish sandwich is a big trigger 
for these visual memories.”

My heart longed to have 

him saying these words to me 
from the bar of a sushi place 
we frequent. But even over the 
phone, I hung onto each word 
he said. He began to unpack 
the fish sandwich, like a door 
to the past. It starts at Crabs 
Claw Inn, a little shack type 
place down the Jersey Shore 
where Bobby took Antonio, a 
European aristocrat he met 
in 
college. 
Antonio 
didn’t 

appreciate 
the 
beauty 
of 

the 
sandwich 
and 
greatly 

misunderstood the power of a 
good meal. It made for a good 
laugh. The memory evolved into 
eating a fish sandwich with my 
father and drinking Polish beer 
and laughing about something 
ridiculous and getting thrown 
out of the restaurant, but not 
without the sandwiches in tow. 
The final memory, hungover 
at a highway side McDonald’s, 
the spring of 1987 — eating a 
McDonald’s filet-o-fish.

I laughed for a while at that 

image, imagining the person 
he was in college. Based on his 
integrity and deep sense of self, 
I doubt he was any different 
back then. I also have many of 
the books he read back then, 
all annotated and stained with 
various substances, perhaps 
a splotch of Sicilian olive oil, 
perhaps the grease of a fish 
sandwich. A man with a heart of 
absolute gold, an irreplaceable 
sense of the things he loves and 
a deep passion for lunch dates 
and sandwiches on good bread. 

“It’s what I grew up with — 

it’s a particularly memorable 
food for me. We grew up on 
the beach. We’d catch fish and 
clean it, like after surfing, and 
we’d make fish sandwiches.”

A pause — for dramatic 

effect perhaps, or to pick up his 
two year old daughter, who is 
sitting at his feet.

“I love my fish sandwich. But 

not as much as I love my Eli.”

The 1,000 mile lunch date

ELI RALLO

Daily Food Columnist

I’m often skeptical of bands who 

define themselves as “genreless”, 
as Son Lux does on their website 
— most who label themselves as 
such have a strong 
tendency to drift 
into masturbatory 
self-importance 
in a paradoxical 
pursuit 
of 

individuality. 
However, in the 
case 
of 
their 

latest 
album, 

Brighter 
Wounds, 

“genreless” 
happens to be an apt description. 
The 
album 
is 
ceaselessly 

innovative 
and 
captivating, 

each song an exploration of a 
different genre and emotion. 
The 
album 
shifts 
seamlessly 

from downtempo slow-burners 
(“Labor”) to erratic, syncopated 

trip-hop (“The Fool You Need”) 
redolent of a more dramatic 
and dynamic James Blake; the 
progression is both surprising and 
natural.

Despite the restrained run 

time of 44 minutes, the album 
feels grandiose and sprawling, 

largely 
due 
to 

both the variety of 
instrumentation 
on 
display 
and 

the 
experimental 

structure of each 
track. There is not a 
boring or repetitive 
track on the album, 
although some are 
prone to a little bit 
of excess — I’m not 

a big fan of “All Directions,” which 
drifts too far into self-indulgence.

The singer, Ryan Lott, has a 

voice that is technically proficient, 
but tends to be a little overly-
theatrical, a certain pervasive, 
wavering quality that threatens 
to turn drama into melodrama 

— it grows tiresome toward the 
end of the album, but it never 
overshadowed the positives of the 
work.

The 
highlights 
include 

“Aquatic,” 
a 
reserved 
and 

thoughtful song marked by a 
gorgeous string motif, as well 
as “Dream State,” a relentlessly-
pounding dream pop epic, possibly 
their most satisfying attempt 
at grandiosity across the whole 
of Brighter Wounds. “Slowly” is 
excellent as well, an atmospheric 
groove with a stuttering rhythm 
and a celestial edge.

I found the album to be slightly 

challenging to listen to in one 
sitting, not because it grew dull, 
but because there was so much 
going on in every track — however, 
it was a rewarding challenge; 
it has been a while since I’ve 
enjoyed listening to a new album 
this much. There is not a dull 
moment during Brighter Wounds, 
an album worth the time of any 
music fan.

stricken and lets not forget, 
humid, roots. Both let the films 
speak for themselves without 
excessive 
plot 
or 
dialogue. 

They treat issues of hardship, 
addiction, 
abuse 
and 
self 

discovery, but they treat them 
tenderly. Carefully.

Similarly, some would say 

that this year’s nominations 
for Best Picture have opened 
up the diversity bracket, with 
“Lady Bird” showing a nuanced 
and imperfect mother-daughter 
relationship 
and 
“Call 
Me 

By Your Name” delivering a 
homosexual love story with 
sensuality 
and 
purpose. 
It 

therefore feels a little bit off 
that “The Florida Project” was 
rendered absent in this category. 
Actually, it was rendered absent 
in most categories except Best 
Actor for Willem Dafoe (“Justice 
League”), whose nomination is 
well-deserved. But that leaves 
“The Florida Project” with a 

total of one nomination, the 
same amount of nominations as 
“Boss Baby.”

To 
say 
that 
Hollywood 

isn’t 
changing 
wouldn’t 
be 

recognizing the obvious. But 
it is definitely not changing 
enough. It almost feels like 
things got suddenly revisionist 

after “Moonlight”’s win. But 
it’s clear that Hollywood is still 
cold to newcomers. “The Florida 
Project”’s 
cinematography 
is 

splendid. Baker himself has 
proven to be an uncommon, 
unorthodox 
filmmaker 
that 

makes us see things we don’t ever 
think about, without exploiting 
them or chastising them — 
we just observe. Brooklynn 
Prince (“Robo-Dog: Airborne”) 
exhibits maybe one of the best 
child 
performances 
in 
film 

history. And yet, no nominations 
in these categories. These stories 
will undoubtedly continue to be 
told by filmmakers who favor 
passion over recognition, while 
Hollywood still prefers the 
sentimental fantasy of “Darkest 
Hour” and “The Post.” But with 
A24’s rapid ascent over the past 
years, hopefully independent 
films like “The Florida Project” 
will gain the recognition they 
deserve.

BOOK REVIEW

If you knew the hour of 

your death, would you live 
differently? 
This 
deeply 

existential 
question 
forms 

the basis of Chloe Benjamin’s 
New York Times-bestselling 
novel “The Immortalists,” a 
saga which follows the four 
Gold siblings from childhood, 
each 
of 
their 
respective 

paths carrying magic, love, 
mystery and science in tow. 

It’s a book that calls a reader 
to consider their own lives 
at every turn of the page. 
The Golds find themselves 
juggling both unfathomable 
tragedy 
and 
joy 
as 
time 

plugs 
onward. 
Benjamin’s 

writing ebbs and flows with 
it, 
creating 
believable 
and 

engaging settings in which the 
drama of life plays out across 
decades. Though these places 
are rich and enthralling, they 
never seem to overshadow 
the poignancy of Benjamin’s 
characters — the Golds’ history 
as a family is steeped in a sense 
of the unknown, something 
which ultimately propels them 
into the future.

The novel begins in late 

1960s New York City, where the 
devoutly Jewish Gold family 
lives in a small apartment on 
the Lower East Side. The Golds 

— parents Saul and Gertie 
and children Varya, Daniel, 
Klara and Simon — live with 
both friction and admiration 
for each other, some closer 
than others but still a family 
nonetheless. Klara and Simon 
are 
inseparable, 
Daniel 

stony and adult and Varya 
withdrawn. The children hear 
of a travelling fortune teller 
who can predict when a person 
will die, and sneak out to find 
her — this is where the story 
truly starts, a point from which 
the Golds decide how their 
lives will truly be, based on 
the years they supposedly have 
left. For Simon, the youngest, 
it’s short, for Klara, somewhat 
longer, for Daniel, middle age 
but Varya is promised a long, 
long life. Benjamin’s expert 
fiction takes this sometimes-
cliché storyline and uses it 
to create a meditation on fate 
and family, following each 
Gold from that fortune-teller’s 
home with their own death 
dates lodged into the children’s 
minds.

From 
there, 
the 
novel 

spirals into four distinct parts, 
each shadowing the Golds’ 
paths into the future with the 
knowledge of the past guiding 
them. Simon and Klara run off 
to San Francisco too young, 
Simon in search of a community 
that supports his budding gay 
identity and Klara following 
dreams of becoming a magician 
to end all magicians. Daniel 
becomes an army doctor, and 
Varya a medical researcher. In 
knowing their own mortality, 
life seems to have a bitter bite — 
each Gold child grapples with 
their fortune on a subconscious 
level, especially in the wake of 
each sibling’s predicted death.

As the decades pass, this 

fortune becomes even more 
abstract, 
as the 
remaining 

Golds try to understand the 
power 
of 
their 
knowledge 

and its influence over their 
realities. Benjamin’s strength 
is in this conflict, as she 
explores the meaning of life and 
death on a small scale, in the 
situations and histories which 
the 
Golds 
find 
themselves 

a part of. The existential 
questions posed throughout 
the novel are daunting, yes, 

but easier to consider in the 
scope of one family whom the 
reader comes to know quite 
well. In this, Benjamin gives 
us a gift — a way to think about 
the 
overwhelming 
darkness 

and lightness of life as applied 
to others, as the reader is on 
the outside looking in. While 
“The 
Immortalists” 
tackles 

different places, periods and 
social issues throughout the 
lifespans of its characters, the 
core question is never lost and 
instead fuels the story, making 
it one of the more engaging and 
emotionally poignant family 
sagas in recent years.

‘The Immortalists’ takes 
on life, death and family 

Benjamin gives 

us a gift — a way

“The 

Immortalists”

“The Insult” is a Lebanese 

film that navigates the rocky 
landscape of ethnic tensions, 
systematic 
prejudice 
and 

victimization. Earning an Oscar 
nomination for Best Foreign 
Language Film, “The Insult” 
seeks to explore the complexities 
surrounding 
Palestinian 

immigration 
into 
Lebanon 

through an allegorical narrative 
of a Lebanese Christian suing 
a Palestinian refugee in court. 
The film works like a courtroom 

drama, in which the ethnic 
divide 
between 
Lebanese 

and Palestinian is examined 
and challenged through the 
framework of legality.

The conflict that sets the 

premise for the entire film comes 
almost immediately — Lebanese 
resident 
Toni 
(Adel 
Karam, 

“Caramel”) gets angry when 
Palestinian 
foreman 
Yasser 

(Kamel El Basha, “Love, Theft 
and 
Other 
Entanglements”) 

fixes his gutter. Yasser throws 
a derogatory slur at Toni, and 
Toni demands an apology. But 
when Yasser goes to apologize, 
Toni throws a derogatory slur 
right back, causing Yasser to 
punch him in the stomach. 
The exchange of insults leads 
Toni to take Yasser to court, 
and the following length of the 
film examines the underlying 
tensions behind this petty and 
inconsequential incident.

The beginning of “The Insult” 

is clumsy and nonsensical. Toni 
appears irrationally angry and 
hostile towards Yasser, who is 
doing his job with a polite and 
calm demeanor. The binary 
between Lebanese Christians 
and 
Palestinian 
refugees 
is 

established early on, and is 
the clear reason for Toni’s 
hostility, but the lack of back 
story for either character makes 
the confrontation seem one-
dimensional and archetypal. The 
pacing is rapid, making Toni’s 
decision to sue seem confusing 
and melodramatic. The film’s 
failure to ground itself and its 
preoccupations 
with 
ethnic 

tension in its first act weakens the 
gravity of the film as a whole — 
Toni and Yasser’s anger towards 
each other doesn’t translate 
seamlessly 
into 
internalized 

prejudice, but instead comes off 
as petty anger.

The court room scenes take 

up the entire second and third 
acts. The court room allegory 
is a somewhat effective tool 
for analyzing perspective in 
victimhood and creating an 
empathetic link between two 
characters 
who 
are 
victims 

of trauma and displacement. 
However, most of the time, these 
scenes are extremely tedious 
and static, with little physical or 
narrative movement. Ultimately, 
the stage on which the film 
chooses to set its discussion of 
ethnic divide is an uncompelling 
one, weighted down by dramatic 
clichés and repetitive imagery.

While Karam and El Basha 

deliver 
solid, 
if 
simplistic, 

performances, the women of the 
film stand as the most compelling 
characters. Rita Hayek (“Kafa: 
Enough”) plays Toni’s wife, a 
strong and outspoken woman 
who acts as the moral compass 

for Toni and the audience. 
Diamand 
Bou 
Abboud 
(“In 

Syria”) plays Yasser’s calculated, 
capable lawyer and Julia Kassar 
commands the film as the firm 
but rational judge. The women in 
this film are all incredibly strong 
and thoughtful characters; their 
actions drive the fate of the men 
whose stubbornness, pride and 
bouts of anger lead them to fall 

in a sinkhole of a larger national 
conversation.

Ultimately, “The Insult” does 

manage to communicate the 
impact of trauma in cementing 
ethnic prejudice, as well as 
the complicated landscape of 
contemporary Lebanon. The film 
seeks to explore silenced parts of 
Lebanese history, showing that 
identities rooted in tragedies of 
the past (the civil war in 1990, 
for example) have profound 
lifelong impacts. With its final 
images, “The Insult” resonates 
with a heavy understanding of 
irrational hatred and the power 
of human empathy to peek 
through the haze. 

‘The Insult’ lacks logic as 
it exlpores ethnic tension

There for the taking

M

el Pearson’s timing was 
interesting, to say the 
least.

Sitting in 

the bowels of 
Little Caesars 
Arena on 
Saturday 
night after 
Michigan 
had defeated 
Michigan 
State, 3-2, to 
claim the Iron 
D Trophy, 
Pearson was 
asked how significant the victory 
was to his team.

“Huge. You can’t say it enough,” 

the Wolverines’ coach replied. 
“We want home ice in the playoffs. 
I think we were picked to finish 
sixth in the conference, so we’ve 
got something to prove.”

It’s a noticeably different 

tone from the one Pearson 
struck earlier this season. That 
was months ago — back when 
Michigan’s dismal 13-19-3 
campaign of a year prior was still 
poignant, rather than the wisp of 
a memory it is now.

Back then, the Wolverines, 

curiously, didn’t act like a team 
with a ton to prove. Yes, they were 
picked to finish second-to-last in 
a loaded Big Ten. No, that didn’t 
mean much to them at all. Pearson 
said at Michigan’s media day in 
late September that he would pick 
his team to win the league if he 
were a forecaster.

“We don’t try and look too 

much into that,” said senior 
forward Dexter Dancs at media 
day. “But it’s obviously a little bit 
of an ‘F you,’ I guess you could say, 
to us. … It was a little bit of a topic 
of conversation, but, you know 
what, we’re not looking too much 
into it.”

And it’s been that way 

all season. Preseason 
prognostications clearly brought 
some motivation, but the 
Wolverines’ success this season 
has never really felt like a rags-
to-riches, chip-on-shoulder 
underdog story. This was further 

evidenced when Michigan took 
down then-No. 4 Minnesota on 
Nov. 11. After that game, Pearson 
was asked if his team made a 
“statement” with the win. His 
response was firm and definitive.

“No, no, no,” he said. “I told 

our team we expect to win every 
night, so it’s not a statement game. 
We’ve got a lot of games, but it’s a 
good win.”

Last Saturday, then, was the 

first time in a good while that 
Pearson or any of his players had 
sought validation.

The timing is interesting, 

because Michigan has already 
proven itself.

There are just four games 

left in the Wolverines’ regular 
season, and at least six when you 
include the Big Ten Tournament. 
After 30 games and all the twists, 
turns, ups and downs that came 
with them, Michigan has nearly 
escaped the Big Ten gauntlet 
relatively intact.

With the victory over the 

Spartans, the Wolverines moved 
to third place in the conference 
standings and 14th in the Pairwise 
rankings, putting themselves 
firmly on the NCAA Tournament 
bubble. It’s a position that few 
outside of Ann Arbor would have 
imagined they’d inhabit five 
months ago.

The hard work needed to get to 

this point, however, has already 
been put in.

Michigan can proudly list a 3-1 

record against Penn State and a 
road sweep at Minnesota on its 
resume. It arguably outplayed 
then-No. 2 Notre Dame when the 
two teams met for a home-and-
home series in early January. The 
Wolverines have battled through 
adversity, such as the absence 
of key players Josh Norris, Will 
Lockwood and Quinn Hughes 
for three games due to the World 
Junior Championships in January, 
and the loss of Lockwood for the 
entire season after a shoulder 
injury.

In his first season on the job, 

Pearson has completely revamped 
Michigan’s offense. In 2016-2017, 

it languished, ranking 57th out 
of 60 teams in Corsi percentage 
— a measure of puck possession 
and shot differential — and 
42nd in goals per game. The 
Wolverines are up to 21st and 14th, 
respectively, this year.

While the first four months 

of Michigan’s season haven’t 
always provided a consistent 
narrative from game to game, 
a wholesale overview of those 
30 games clearly reveals what 
the Wolverines have proven to 
be — young, talented and much-
improved, strong in some areas 
and shaky in others, with a very 
real chance at the postseason.

This weekend brings two 

clashes — one home and one 
away — with the Fighting Irish. 
Michigan shouldn’t, and maybe 
won’t, be punished excessively if 
they suffer a sweep at the hands 
of the No. 1 team in the nation. 
But a victory would likely do 
wonders for the Wolverines’ 
hopes.

“We’ll be ready and I know 

Notre Dame will be ready,” 
Pearson said Saturday. “But we 
had two good games with them, 
and we’ll look forward to it.”

After that, however, Michigan’s 

schedule offers no such ambiguity. 
The final regular season home 
series is a non-conference set 
against Arizona State. And the 

Wolverines are guaranteed a 
best-of-three quarterfinal series 
in the Big Ten Tournament, 
likely against either Penn State, 
Wisconsin or Minnesota — which 
Michigan, three points ahead of 
the fourth-place Gophers, is likely 
to host.

A sweep against the Sun Devils, 

who rank 56th in Pairwise, feels 
imperative. As does a first-round 
tournament victory in a series 
against the Nittany Lions or 
Badgers — the loser of which 
likely would see their tournament 
dreams vanish.

If Michigan accomplishes 

both of those feats, a semifinal 
matchup against Notre Dame or 
Ohio State likely awaits. Win then, 
and it becomes nearly impossible 
to picture the Wolverines failing 
to snag an at-large bid. But at that 
point, why not just win the Big 
Ten and remove all doubt?

It’s past the time for validation. 

At this point, Michigan’s identity 
is all but finalized. What’s left 
requires putting that identity into 
action.

The Wolverines have earned 

their spot on the bubble. 
Everything after that is there for 
the taking.

Wolverines struggle in
Match Play tournament

The Michigan men’s golf team 

opened up its spring season on 
Thursday 
at 
the 
prestigious 

Hammock Beach Golf course in 
Palm Beach, Fla.

After 
a 
three-and-a 
half 

month hiatus, the Wolverines 
matched up against Ohio State 
in the opening round of the Big 
Ten Match Play Championship. 
They 
struggled 
against 
the 

Buckeyes, ultimately falling, 5-1. 
Sophomore Brent Ito was the only 
successful golfer for Michigan, as 
he notched a 4-2 victory.

“Although we started off slow, 

there were still a lot of positive 
things we saw from the guys,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 
Chris 

Whitten.

Following the loss to Ohio 

State, 
the 
Wolverines 
saw 

massive improvements against 
top-seeded Purdue. The squad 
became more familiar with the 
course, but still fell, 4-2. Junior 
Nick Charlson offered a bright 
spot in his matchup, which came 
down to the final holes before he 
eventually prevailed, finishing 
two up on his opponent.

“The team played much better 

against 
the 
Boilermakers, 
I 

thought,” Whitten said.

Sitting in last place in the 

division 
heading 
into 
the 

weekend, Michigan looked to 
shape things up going into its 
matchup 
against 
Maryland. 

The tournament, however, got 
interrupted by a fog delay, thus 
reducing the match from 18 holes 
to nine. This did not bode well for 
the Wolverines, as they lost a pair 
of matches coming down to the 
final few holes.

“Today was a lot of situational 

things,” Whitten said. “One putt 
you needed for momentum just 
never fell our way.”

The 
Wolverines 
faced 

Nebraska in one last consolation 
match Saturday afternoon.

Freshmen Henry Spring and 

Charlie Pilon each tallied victories 
against the Cornhuskers. Spring 
won his match, 6-4, while Pilon 
sank 
Nebraska’s 
Sean 
Song, 

4-3. The match proved to be the 
most competitive of the day, as 
the Wolverines finished with 2.5 
victories. However, this was not 
enough, as the Cornhuskers came 
out on top, 3.5-2.5.

Michigan faces a two-week 

break before its next action at the 
Southwestern Jones invitational. 
And it’s clear there is a lot of 
improvement to be made before 
then. 

“We need to get back into the 

rhythm for our next tournament,” 
Whitten said.

The Michigan men’s golf team lost all four of its matches this weekend.

Wolverines need to find their flow
O

n Jan. 23, the Michigan 
women’s basketball team 
put 

Michigan 
State to 
shame with a 
26-point vic-
tory. When 
the two sides 
met again last 
Sunday, the 
Wolverines 
started the 
game with a 
7-0 run and 
looked like they might cause fur-
ther humiliation to their rivals.

That didn’t happen. Michigan 

quickly lost its touch and fell to 
the Spartans, 66-61.

After the game, Michigan 

State coach Suzy Merchant best 
described the Wolverines’ fallout:

“They couldn’t get into a flow,” 

Merchant said.

Come to think of it, when was 

the last time No. 23 Michigan (9-5 
Big Ten, 20-7 overall) was in its 
flow?

Yes, the Wolverines won 

their prior contest against 
Northwestern in dominant 
fashion, by 21 points. Senior guard 
Katelynn Flaherty and junior 
center Hallie Thome had silenced 
the offensive critics, tallying 36 
and 25 points, respectively. But at 
12th in the conference and 184th 
in the RPI rankings, the Wildcats 
aren’t exactly the most skilled 
team.

A team like Michigan is 

expected to dismantle opponents 
of Northwestern’s caliber. While 
the lopsided victory may have 
boosted the Wolverines’ morale, 
they hardly reached their flow.

Michigan surely wasn’t in its 

flow the week before that, either. 
The Wolverines were upset, 63-56, 
by Rutgers on the road, and also 
blew a 16-point fourth quarter 
lead in an overtime loss to Purdue.

While these two teams are a 

step up from Northwestern, they 
still aren’t anywhere close to the 
top of the pack in the conference. 
The Scarlet Knights are ninth in 
the Big Ten and were on a four-
game losing streak at the time. 

And against the Boilermakers, 
Michigan was cruising — as 
expected — but completely fell 
apart. Both were contests the 
Wolverines — who have been 
nationally ranked all season — 
should have easily won.

The three matchups prior were 

all blowout victories. One was 
against Illinois — who is last in 
the Big Ten standings — and the 
others were against the Spartans 
and the Wildcats.

Though Michigan outscored 

its opponents by an impressive 91 
points through these three games, 
nothing less was expected. For 
instance, the main reason the 
Wolverines dominated Michigan 
State in the first meeting was 
because the Spartans were 
burdened by injuries. The second 
matchup perhaps seemed more 
indicative of the true result.

Through this lens, the last time 

Kim Barnes Arico’s team won a 
meaningful game was almost a 
month ago in Columbus. On Jan. 
16, the Wolverines topped then-
No. 8 Ohio State, 84-75. They shot 

over 53 percent from the floor in 
that game and attacked the basket 
well. It was a signature win. 
Michigan was in its flow.

The recent loss against 

Michigan State marked the 
Wolverines’ third defeat in their 
last four games.

“We battled till the end,” 

Barnes Arico said after the game, 
“but were never really able to 
recover.”

The season is spiraling out of 

control. Michigan is still hanging 
on to its NCAA Tournament 
aspirations, but just barely.

With two games left in the 

regular season, the team still 
has a chance to get redemption. 
Recovery will be tough, though, 
as it will face Minnesota on the 
road and No. 10 Maryland at 
home.

To make the most out of what’s 

left, the Wolverines must keep 
battling and find their flow.

‘M’ comes up short at 
Indoor Championships

Heading into the weekend 

ranked No. 10 in the nation, 
the Michigan women’s tennis 
team knew it would have to 
get past tough opponents at 
the ITA National Team Indoor 
Championship. What it didn’t 
anticipate was a disappointing 
1-2 weekend record.

Hoping to get four points 

against Georgia Tech just like 
it had done in an invitational 
to kick off the season, the 
Wolverines came up just short 
when it counted.

“We went in knowing they 

were a really tough team, but 
I think we took 
some confidence 
from when we 
played them in 
our invitational 
about a month 
ago,” said junior 
Kate 
Fahey. 

“We knew we 
could hang with 
them, but they 
honestly 
just 

played 
better 

(Friday).”

After an uncontested first 

day of doubles matches, when 
Michigan dropped the point 
to Georgia Tech, it came out 
with a different fire the next 
day. Facing No. 12 Auburn, 
the Wolverines took no time 
to 
make 
adjustments 
and 

get started on the right foot, 
claiming the doubles point 
with 6-0 and 6-1 victories.

“Obviously 
the 
coaches 

were a little disappointed in 
our doubles, and we talked 
about it and realized it can 
only go up from here,” Fahey 
said. “We all played with no 
pressure. We played to win, 
and I think that was the 
difference.”

However, 
Michigan 
was 

not able to keep its lead for 
long, losing tight matches at 
the last four singles positions. 

No. 6 Bella Lorenzini and No. 
4 Mira Ruder-Hook dropped 
their final sets in tiebreakers, 
giving Auburn the two points 
needed for victory.

“(Mira) did a really good 

job. She went down 5-2 in 
the third set, but she really 
stayed tough,” Fahey said. “I 
heard (associate head coach 
Teryn Ashley-Fitch) tell her 
to be aggressive and keep 
going for her shots because 
that’s really her game and 
what she does well. The other 
girl just played a really good 
tiebreak.”

With one more match left 

against the host Wisconsin, 
Michigan faced the unusually 

disastrous 
prospect 
of 

a 
winless 

record. 
Its 

thirst 
for 
a 

win showed in 
the box score, 
sweeping 
Wisconsin, 
4-0.

“We 
did 

have some fire 
in 
our 
belly 

after losing two in a row,” 
Fahey said. “We wanted to get 
some redemption and get one 
win from the weekend.”

Though this past weekend 

didn’t go as planned, Michigan 
is staying positive for the long 
conference season ahead.

“Indoors is always a great 

tournament to go to because 
you are surrounded by the best 
teams in the country, early in 
the season. It is like a preview 
of the NCAA Tournament,” 
said Michigan coach Ronni 
Bernstein. “We would have 
liked to have gotten a few 
more wins, but it is a long 
season and we will have more 
opportunities to face some of 
the best teams in the country. 

“We know what we need 

to work on and will continue 
to get better as this season 
progresses.”

The architect of Michigan’s new identity

Zavier Simpson had heard 

Iowa guard Jordan Bohannon’s 
name a few too many times that 
week. 

Resting 
against 
the 
wall 

outside the locker room of the 
emptied Carver-Hawkeye Arena 
following Michigan’s 75-68 win 
over Iowa, Simpson made that 
abundantly clear.

“Defense is a pride thing in 

my opinion,” Simpson said with 
a straight stare and a stern tone. 
“I knew Bohannon was good. 
The coaches love Bohannon, 
to the point where it started to 
become annoying. … Bohannon, 
Bohannon, Bohannon.”

At 
the 
16 
minute 
mark, 

he 
heard 
the 
voice 
again: 

“Bohannon.”

At 
the 
18-minute 
mark, 

“Bohannon.”

The 
35 
minute 
mark? 

“Bohannon.”

But defense being a source 

of vehement pride is nothing 
new for Simpson. Teammates 
frequently use the word “dog” as 
their endearing way to describe 
him. That mindset alone has 
often been his path to playing 
time, even when his offensive 
production sputters. He’ll grab 
any opportunity he can get to 
tell you he takes every defensive 
matchup personally, and that 
you should too.

“I felt like it’s a disease,” 

Simpson said, “so it can spread.”

That bird in his ear? The one 

that drove Simpson to near 
insanity on a frigid January 
night in rural Iowa? The one 
that compelled him to shut 
down Jordan Bohannon and 
then therapeutically grumble his 
name into submission afterward? 
That was Luke Yaklich.

That disease?
Oh, it’s spread all right. Like 

wildfire.

When 
Yaklich 
approached 

Joliet 
West 
High 
athletic 

director Steven Millsaps about 
a collegiate coaching offer in 
2013, Millsaps wasn’t surprised.

“Luke’s such a student of 

the game,” Millsaps said in a 
phone interview last week. “I 
remember clear as day, when 
he was talking to me, we came 
off a pretty good season when 

he came to me and talked to me 
about he got offered to go be at 
Illinois State.

“He was very unsure — 

obviously that’s a big jump.”

Yaklich 
was 
comfortable 

at Joliet West. He had built 
a successful basketball team 
and was thriving as a history 
teacher and content specialist, 
overseeing many of his peers 
on staff and implementing a 
program called “Teach Like a 
Champion.” His family was a 
staple in the Joliet community, 
with 
his 
son 
Griffin 
even 

emerging into a talented young 
basketball player himself. 

“Teaching is a pretty good 

gig,” Millsaps said. “We all 
think we’re going to be in our 
positions the entire time. Then 
opportunity and life takes you 
in other places.”

For Yaklich, life took him to 

Illinois State, a program that 
was 21-33 in conference play 
the three years prior and, more 
pertinent to Yaklich, a middling 
defensive team even in its better 
seasons. Yaklich was a coach 
who ran a man-to-man scheme, 
heading off to a program that 
ran a 2-3 zone. 

“You 
have 
to 
design 
a 

system that best allows your 
players to be successful given 
their 
personal 
strengths 
as 

defensive 
players,” 
Yaklich 

said recently. “You are looking 
at your opponent’s strengths, 
your own player’s strengths and 
sometimes the sum of the parts 
is greater than the whole.”

He took a group of parts at 

Illinois State and undeniably 
made them a greater whole, 
branding a hard-nosed defensive 
identity with a roster that 
seemed hardly conducive for 
such. Last season the Redbirds 
had only one player taller than 
6-foot-9, and he played just 12 
games.

In his four seasons at Illinois 

State, Yaklich led a resurgent 
Redbirds defense, capping off 
his tenure with an adjusted 
defensive efficiency that ranked 
19th in the country last season.

This 
offseason, 
when 

Michigan coach John Beilein 
was left scrambling to fill 
two assistant coach positions 
— 
including 
Billy 
Donlon, 

his 
defensive 
confidant 
— 

he sought assertiveness. He 
wanted a defensive voice that 
could command a gym in one 
moment, and calmly instruct an 
individual player in the next. 

Yaklich 
was 
eager 
and 

qualified to oblige.

And he knew both he and 

Beilein — both former teachers 
— 
shared 
a 
philosophical 

wavelength in that regard.

But Yaklich wasn’t going 

to 
passively 
wait 
out 
the 

exhaustive hiring process. He 
wanted to take matters into his 
own hands. 

“We didn’t know each other,” 

Yaklich said. “So one of the 
things (Beilein) wanted to know, 
he used to always say, ‘Do you 
have that voice? Do you have 
command?’ ”

Yaklich instructed a video 

staff member at Illinois State 
to send him clips from practice 
showing him in action, which 
he then relayed to Beilein. 
Player film is one thing. This 
was coaching film. Beilein’s 
skepticism 
vanished 
shortly 

after. 

“He goes, ‘Is that how you are 

all the time?’ ” Yaklich recalled. 

“It was a great line. I said, ‘Yes, 
Coach. I’m comfortable between 
the 
lines 
and 
comfortable 

teaching.’ … I knew when he 
asked me that question, I said, 
‘Man, if that’s the hangup, I 
think I’ll be able to make a good 
impression there in the first 
couple days.’ ”

***
Yaklich was hired last August, 

along with another Illinois State 
assistant, 
Deandre 
Haynes. 

Yaklich 
instantly 
immersed 

himself in tape from previous 
seasons. By the time the team’s 
media day rolled around, he was 
able to discuss, in length, the 
team’s defensive strengths and 
weaknesses, how he hoped to 
deploy individual players and 
tangible goals for the defense he 
had already begun build.

In practice, his entire focus 

was on the defensive side of 
the ball, allowing Beilein the 
freedom to work with individual 
players.

“(Defense is) all he thinks 

about,” Beilein said on Feb. 2, 
the day before the Wolverines 
played 
Minnesota. 
“That’s 

really good for our coaching 
staff. As a head coach you’ve got 
to think of everything, but when 
I’ve got a guy who doesn’t care 
what we’re doing offensively — 
he does care, but he (doesn’t) 
worry about that — keeps me on 
point toward what we have to 
do. … We do almost everything 
he suggests.”

Just 24 hours later, Yaklich 

would make one his boldest 
suggestions of the season.

The Wolverines trailed the 

Golden Gophers 50-40 with 
11 minutes left, as Minnesota 
guards 
Nate 
Mason 
and 

Isaiah 
Washington 
made 

Crisler Center their personal 
playground. Yaklich implored 
Beilein to unleash a previously 
unused zone. It was a zone 
Beilein 
said 
they 
practiced 

“every other day,” but had yet to 
use. In the heat of the moment, 
with an upset loss staring them 

in the face, Yaklich decided the 
time was right.

Minnesota went over three 

minutes before scoring next, 
allowing a sluggish Michigan 
offense to regain its footing. 
Over the next eight minutes, 
the Wolverines strung together 
a 17-6 run, capturing the lead. 
They finished the game in the 
zone, pulling out a 76-73 win in 
overtime.

“That was Luke Yaklich all 

the way,” Beilein said after the 
game.

Before 
Yaklich 
arrived, 

Michigan had never finished 
higher than 37th in adjusted 
defensive 
efficiency 
in 
the 

Beilein 
era. 
This 
year 
the 

Wolverines are 25th. 

They 
didn’t 
do 
it 
by 

reinventing the wheel, either. 
Yaklich came in wanting to 
rebound at an elite rate and 
contest every shot. 

“You 
can’t 
emphasize 

everything 
defensively, 
you 

have to hang your hat on one or 
two things,” Yaklich said. “You 
have to be able to guard the 
dribble and rebound the first 
shot. I think those two things 
take you a long way in February 
and March.”

Check and check.
Yaklich 
inherited 
a 

historically poor rebounding 
program — and a frontcourt 
with 
plenty 
of 
rebounding 

deficiencies. 
He 
aimed 
to 

have a defensive rebounding 
percentage over 75 percent. The 
team’s 
defensive 
rebounding 

percentage currently sits 13th 
nationally at 78.8 percent. The 
previous best in the Beilein era 
was 2015, when the Wolverines 
finished 49th nationally at 75.6 
percent.

Michigan is also allowing just 

63.7 points per game, the fewest 
the Wolverines have averaged 
since the 2012-2013 national 
runner-up, when the shot clock 
was 35 seconds. 

The 
prudent 
defensive 

adjustment against Minnesota 
was “Luke Yaklich all the 
way.” And maybe this is all 
Luke Yaklich. Maybe this is the 
emergence of a future high-
end head coach. Maybe — just 
maybe 
— 
Beilein 
stumbled 

upon one of the pre-eminent 
defensive minds in the small 
town of Normal, Illinois.

***
Yaklich cracks a wry smile, 

breaking through his even-
keeled demeananor when he 
hears the story about Simpson 
and Bohannon. He can’t help 
himself.

“X is great,” he says, before 

jolting 
back 
into 
character, 

diving 
into 
a 
psychological 

breakdown of his defensive 
mentality. 
Yaklich 
doesn’t 

say 
whether 
the 
Bohannon 

saturation was an intentional 
motivational tactic. He doesn’t 
have to.

“(Simpson) brings it each and 

every night, and I’m glad he 
takes some of those challenges 
from 
the 
coaching 
staff 

personally.”

Simpson 
is 
a 
player 

engineered to play for Yaklich. 
But while there’s a degree 
of predictability in a close 
relationship between the most 
avid 
defensive 
competitor 

and the de facto “defensive 
coordinator,” the rest of the 
team came into the season with 
defensive questions littering the 
roster.

Yaklich’s 
biggest 

accomplishment 
doesn’t 
rest 

in an uber-motivated Simpson, 
but in a team-wide attitude 
shift. Michigan has had elite 
defenders under Beilein — D.J. 
Wilson, Jordan Morgan and 
Zack Novak spring to mind. 

But it’s not simply a rarity for 

a Beilein-led Michigan squad 
to have an elite team defense. 
It has never had an elite team 
defense.

“We 
were 
either 
pretty 

good offensively or bad in both 
(offense and defense),” said 
former 
Michigan 
basketball 

player Anthony Wright in a 
phone interview. Wright played 
under Beilein from 2007-2010.

“Before, Beilein would always 

say, ‘Hey, look, you may have 
a mismatch when we have to 
guard bigger guys, but they’re 
going to have to guard you, too.’ 
That was the mindset.”

That transformation extends 

far beyond some overhaul of 
the previous system or grand 
change in scheme. This has 
been about a renewed emphasis 
and hyperfocus, not exhaustive 
change.

For the players, the attitude 

comes with a dose of direspect 
and 
a 
modicum 
of 
talent 

compensation.

“We may not have the same 

talent offensively as years past,” 
said senior guard Muhammad-
Ali Abdur-Rahkman after a 
58-47 win over Northwestern 
Jan. 29. “But we’re still a good 
team. We’re just playing to 
our strength — we have a lot 
of athletic guys that can play 
defense. So we just play to our 
strength.”

The sky is orange. Water is 

dry. Michigan’s defense is its 
strength.

“Coach Yaklich was really on 

that from the beginning of the 
year, ‘We’ve got to play defense, 
we’re not going to win games 
if we don’t play defense,’ ” said 
freshman guard Jordan Poole. 
“But then the players started 
buying in, saying, ‘All right, he’s 
right, but we’re the ones playing 
out there so we’re the only ones 
that can really make a difference 
about this.’ ”

It made a difference in a 

stifling performance in a 59-52 
win at Texas, in the marquee 
non-conference 
win 
of 
the 

season. It made a difference 
in a 58-47 rockfight against 
Northwestern at home. It made 
a difference in the one-point 
victory over Maryland. It has 
made a difference all season 
on one of the worst offensive 
squads of the Beilein era.

Twenty-seven games in — 20 

wins later — this is no longer a 
mirage. It’s February now. This 
is who the Wolverines are.

“I think we have the right 

personnel, the right mentality 
(defensively). … That’s the way 
we practice, that’s the way we 
play,” said junior center Moritz 
Wagner 
before 
pausing 
to 

consider the peculiarity of what 
he — a team captain and the 
voice of the team — said next.

“It’s kind of our identity.”

Sophomore guard Zavier Simpson’s tough style of play has married well with Yaklich’s defensive vision.
