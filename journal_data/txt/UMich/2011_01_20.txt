HEALTH CARE REFORM
. After health
care changes,
students now
see benefits

Students can remain
on parents' health,
insurance plan
until age 26
By HALEY GLATTHORN
Daily StaffReporter
Nearly 10 months after Con-
gress passed the historic health
care reform bill, some of the ini-
tial changes enacted by the legis-
lation are beginning to take effect
at the University.
The most significant change
for the majority of students and
University employees is the part
of the law that requires insurance
companies to allow individual
under age 26 to remain on their
 parents' health plans - regard-
less of their status as a dependent
or student.
Robert Winfield, the Uni-
versity's chief health officer
and director of the University
Health Service, said about 5 per-
cent of undergraduate students
and 10 percent of graduate stu-
dents currently don't have health
insurance. The new health care
legislation benefits those students
by offering more complete cover-
age in the event of accidents or
serious illness. However the ser-
vices UHS offers won't be impact-
ed, he said.
"What has been a problem is

that students who are 22 or 23
might not have insurance under
their parents," Winfield said. "We
(once) had a student with an infec-
tion and the bill was $15,000."
Laurie Burchett, student insur-
ance manager at UHS, said she is
interested in seeing how many of
the approximately 1,400 students
currently on the University's
domestic insurance plan will not
submit payment for the winter
2011 semester since they can now
remain covered by their parents'
insurance.
"A lot of people's parents don't
have health insurance, and I've
heard a lot of companies raised
the rate so that it would be more
expensive to put their child back
on their insurance," Burchett
said.
For University employees who
receive health care coverage
through the University, Burchb t
said the process of putting an
employee's child back on the Uni-
versity's health insurance plan is
simple. Employees are required
to fill outa form requesting to put
a child on the plan and provide a
birth certificate and submit it to
the benefits office.
In a conference call with
reporters Tuesday afternoon,
White House Press Secretary
Robert Gibbs said this specific
provision of the health care law
was purposely created for col-
lege-aged individuals.

LANSING - Delivering his first
State of the State address, Repub-
lican Gov. Rick Snyder stressed
the importance of Michigan's eco-
nomic development as he spoke
before the state legislature at the
Capitol building here last night.
In his address, Snyder empha-
sized the need for public and

private partnerships in order to
stimulate economic growth. Sny-
der highlighted several examples,
including a pending collaboration
between the corporation Procter
& Gamble and the University
Research Corridor - the research
consortium comprised of the Uni-
versity of Michigan, Michigan
State University and Wayne State
University.
"It's groundbreaking," Snyder
said. "It's a collaboration that will
speed ideas to the marketplace by
simplifying the legal process that
companies and universities use
to negotiate research projects. It
will also provide opportunities for
Michigan students to gain first-
hand exposure to large compa-

nies and the real business world,
while exposing these companies
to top talent and future potential
employees."
Ultimately, Snyder said, the
program will be expanded to
include all 15 public universities in
the state, notjustthe institutions a
part of the URC.
In an interview with The Mich-
igan Daily after Snyder's speech,
University President Mary Sue
Coleman said she was glad the
new governor spoke about unify-
ing the state to finda way to devel-
op Michigan's economy.
Coleman added that she was
"extremely pleased" Snyder spe-
cifically mentioned the URC-P&G
partnership in his remarks.

"It's a big breakthrough," Cole-
man said. "It's a wonderful exam-
ple of ways we can be effective in
interacting with companies and
using the resources all over the
state."
In a telephone interview last
night, P&G spokeswoman Lisa
Popyk said the company is part-
nering with the URC to gain
access to the state's top talent, as
well as to give students the chance
to experience the business world.
"The universities are a great
source of innovation and talent
and research," Popyk said. "We've
found that by partnering with
them we can bring innovation to
markets, often faster with higher

S'1' graduate schools try to
keep undergraduates in A2

School of Public
Health, Law School
and others increase
recruitment efforts
By LEE SOVA-CLAYPOOL
For theDaily
The University has long taken
pride in its undergraduate stu-
dents being "the leaders and best."
And in following this motto, the
University doesn't want students
leaving Ann Arbor anytime soon.
To encourage undergraduates
to continue their graduate-level

education at the University, sever-
al graduate schools, including the
School of Information, the School
of Social Work, the School of Pub-
lic Health and the Law School,
have taken a more active approach
to recruiting on campus in recent
years, according to University,
admissions officials.
These new recruiting tech-
niques include targeting student
organizations and contacting indi-
vidual students in order to receive
as many applications as possible
from University undergraduates.
And admission officials say these
new tactics are working. Most
graduate programs at the Univer-
sity reported an increase in appli-

cants in the past few years, with
active on-campus recruitment
being a potential contributor to
this rise.
As an example of typical
recruitment activity, the School
of information sends postcards
and e-mails to every single under-
graduate with information about
open houses and advising oppor-
tunities, according to Laura Elgas,
associate director of admissions
and student affairs at the School of
Information.
"We definitely find that students
who completed their undergrad at
Michigan have some advantages
in that they are familiar with the

The University hosted a wide
range of employers yesterday at the
2011 Winter Career Expo which
encouraged students to explore
potential careers.

More than 800 students and
about 65 organizations were
expected to attend this year's expo,
held in the Michigan Union and
co-sponsored by the Career Center
and Office of Multi-Ethnic Student
Affairs. The employer registration
rate for this year's expo was up by
23 percent from last year, according
to Schueneman, the career events
manager for the Career Center.
One-third of the organizations
in attendance were non-profit and
government agencies including

City Year Detroit, Yes Prep Pub-
lic Schools and Grassroots Cam-
paigns.The remaining two-thirds
of the organizations comprised of
for-profit groups like Capital One,
Target and Toyota, which were
offering leadership development
programs and job opportunities in
advertising.

Perfecting penmanship

Stemming from their
interest in Islamic studies,
LSA juniors Anthony Chase
and Lena Abuelroos are aim-
ing to give other students on
campus an opportunity to
learn the history and writing
of Arabic calligraphy.
Chase and Abuelroos
founded the Arabic Cal-
ligraphy Club last fall after
realizing that many students
on campus, like themselves,
were interested in learning
how to write Arabic calligra-
phy, Chase said.
"Both of us have been
interested in learning cal-
ligraphy for a long time,"
Chase said. "You're kind of
exposed to it a lot just study-
ing Arabic, but we never
really learn how to do it or
just how the art form was
developed."

Mohammed El Khoja,
a local calligrapher from
Libya who wrote calligraphy
for newspapers in his home
country, will start to teach
the club's members how to
write the most widely used
Arabic script as well as dis-
cuss the history of Arabic
calligraphy at their next
meeting.
"Right now we're just try-
ing to learn the basics, and
after we have that down, we
then want to branch off and
maybe explore other forms
of text," Abuelroos said.
Though El Khoja didn't
formally study calligraphy
in school, Chase and Abuel-
roos said he has previously
worked with many students
in Ann Arbor.
As the club's membership
grows, Abuelroos said she

and Chase will continue to
try to expand the opportu-
nities available to students
interested in studying Ara-
bic calligraphy. Later this
semestertheclub'smembers
are planning to visit the Uni-
versity's Special Collections
Library and see old calligra-
phy texts, which are studied
by the University's Islamic
Studies faculty members.
Since its founding, the
club has. attracted a diverse
group of students and has
drawn about 35 people to its
first meeting.
"We have individuals
from all over," Abuelroos
said. "A couple of our mem-
bers have no exposure to
Arabic whatsoever, and
they're attending. It's open
to everyone."

Supreme Court rules NASA
background checks are OK

Investigations of
gov.'t job applicants
to continue
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Supreme Court yesterday refused
to stop federal investigations
into the private lives of people
who want to work at government
installations - even those who
don't have security clearances and
don't work on secret projects.
The high court turned away
challenges to background checks
of low-risk employees at NASA's
Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasa-
dena, Calif., despite claims from
those federal contractors that the
investigations were unconstitu-
tional because they invaded their
privacy.
"We reject the argument that
the government, when it requests
job-related personal information
in an employment background

check, has a constitutional burden
to demonstrate that its questions
are 'necessary' or the least restric-
tive means of furthering its inter-
ests," Justice Samuel Alito said.
Employees said the agency was
invading their privacy by requir-
ing investigations that looked into
their medical records and asked
friends about their finances and
sex lives. If the workers didn't
agree to the checks and fill out
questionnaires on Standard Form
85 (SF-85) and Form 42, they were
to be fired.
The Jet Propulsion Laboratory
is NASA's premier robotics lab,
famous for sending unmanned
spacecraft to Mars and the outer
solar system. Unlike other NASA
research centers, it's run by the
California Institute of Technol-
ogy. Lab scientists, engineers and
staff are Caltech employees, but
the campus and its buildings are
owned by NASA.
A federal judge originally

refused to stop NASA's back-
ground checks while the lawsuit
made its way through the courts.
He was overturned by the 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in San
Francisco.
Alito wrote, in a unanimous
judgment for the Supreme Court,
that the justices were not ruling on
whether there was a constitution-
al right to "informational privacy."
"We hold, however, that whatev-
er the scope of this interest, it does
not prevent the government from
asking reasonable questions of the
sort included on SF-85 and Form
42 in an employment background
investigation that is subject to the
Privacy Act's safeguards against
public disclosure," Alito said.
The lead plaintiff in the case,
Robert Nelson, a senior research
scientist at NASA JPL, said he was
disappointed with the Supreme
Court's decision, addingthat it will
dissuade some qualified potential
employees from working at JPL.

New bacteria threatens citrus
crop, believed to be incurable

Hundreds of
researchers met to
brainstorm ways to
combat disease
VERO BEACH, Fla. (AP) - While
Florida farmers have lost some of
their crop to cold weather for the
second year ina row, they saya fast-
spreading, incurable bacteria pres-
ents a greater threat to their trees
and the citrus industry.
Citrus greening has destroyed
groves in the U.S., Brazil, Asia and
Africa. Detected in Florida in 2005,
it leaves fruit sour, malformed and
unusable. Eventually, itkillsthetree.
"Citrus is our signature crop,"
said Florida Agriculture Commis-
sioner Adam Putnam. "The sheer
economic impact it has on our state
- it doesn't matter whether you live
in a condo tower on Miami Beach
or you live in Zolfo Springs, Flori-
da, this impacts you as a Floridian

because the demise of the Florida
citrus industry would have envi-
ronmental, economic and social
impacts."
The disease has been particu-
larly devastating because it takes
years for citrus trees to reach peak
production, and the disease targets
young trees, making it difficult for
growers to replace those that have
been lost.
"It's probably is one ofthe biggest
negative impacts in Florida today,
short of the housing collapse," said
Louis Schacht, a Vero Beach farmer
whose family has grown oranges for
60 years.
Trees don't pass the bacteria to
each other. Instead, greening - also
known as yellow dragon disease,
HIB or, in Chinese, Huanglongbing
- is spread by insects. There is no
cure.
Hundreds of researchers from
more than a dozen countries con-
verged on Orlando last week to talk
about the disease and hear the lat-
est research. They found hope in

one announcement: A University of
Florida-led group of international
scientistshas assembled thegenome
sequences for two citrus variet-
ies - sweet orange and Clementine
mandarin - in an effort to deter-
mine why trees are so susceptible to
greening. Eventually, they hope to
engineer varieties that aren't.
"There is nothing we have today
that is effective against the bacte-
ria," said Dan Gunter, chief operat-
ing officer of the Citrus Research
and Development Foundation Inc.,
which funds research on greening
and other citrus issues.
Two percent to 3 percent of Flor-
ida's citrus trees die in a typical year
because of things like cold weather,
bugs or old age. But since greening
emerged, 4 percent to 5 percent have
been lost each year, experts said.
Since most of Florida's oranges
become juice, while California
mainly grows those found in lunch
boxes, greening could eventually
affect consumers at the breakfast
table.

Lawyer argues
Duvalier's right to
participate in politics
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP)
- Haitian authorities want Jean-
Claude Duvalier to leave the coun-
try, but the once-feared dictator
will not go and could even choose
to get involved in politics, one of
his lawyers said yesterday.
Defense attorney Reynold
Georges told reporters that it is
Duvalier's right to remain in Haiti,
but that he is free to travel. He
stressed that Haiti's government
has not ordered Duvalier to return
to France following his surprise
return on Sunday.
"He is free to do whatever he
wants, go wherever he wants,"
Georges said of the once-feared
strongman, known as "Baby Doc."
"It is his right to live in his coun-
try ... He is going to stay. It is his
country."
Georges said a Haitian judge
who met with the 59-year-old for-
mer leader, who apparently does
not have a valid Haitian passport,
asked him when he planned to
leave. "They wanthim to leave," he
insisted.
Georges portrayed the former
leader as an esteemed ex-president
iB

who might choose to help a small
Duvalierist political party during
his time in Haiti, though he gave
no details on what the help might
involve.
Duvalier, who assumed power
in 1971 at age 19 following the
death of his notorious father,
Francois "Papa Doc" Duvalier,
faces accusations of corruption
and embezzlement for allegedly
pilfering the treasury before his
1986 ouster. He returned to Haiti
on Sunday evening after being
exiled for nearly 25 years.
Alice Blanchet, a special advis-
er to Prime Minister Jean-Max
Bellerive, refused to speculate
about Duvalier's plans to stay in
a country struggling through a
dire political crisis following the
problematic Nov. 28 first-round
presidential election, as well as a
cholera epidemic and a troubled
recovery from the last year's dev-
astating earthquake.
"Let justice do its job, run its
course. He is a citizen and no one
is above the law," she said in a
Wednesday e-mail, adding that
Duvalier "remains available to the
prosecutor" while he is in Haiti.
On Thursday, Duvalier stayed
at the upscale Hotel Karibe in
the hills above downtown Port-
au-Prince and spoke publicly only
through his lawyers. Duvalier and
4t

his longtime companion Vero-
nique Roy were seen eating break-
fast on his balcony.
Outside, on the rutted streets
of Port-au-Prince, there were no
signs of widespread support for
Duvalier. When he was led to a
courthouse on Tuesday, support-
ers staged demonstrations on
his behalf but they were tiny by
Haiti standards. More than half
the nation's people are too young
to have lived through his govern-
ment.
Most Haitians who remember
the Duvalier years hoped he had
left for good, closing an era of
terror and repression that began
under "Papa Doc." Human rights
groups say tens of thousands of
people were killed during the
29-year father-and-son dictator-
ship, while many others were
maimed or forced into exile.
Haitian authorities moved
toward trying Duvalier for alleged
corruption and embezzlement
committed during his brutal
15-year rule by opening an inves-
tigation on Tuesday, but specifics
about the probe were scarce.
Duvalier defense attorney
Gervais Charles said a judge of
instruction will decide whether
there is enough evidence to go to
trial. It's a process that can take up
to three months.

in his 30s and about 5-foot-9. All the
victims are black, and they range in
age from 17 to 33 years old, the chief
said.
MIAMI
Florida's ban on
adoptions by gay
couples overturned
A gay Miami man has officially
adopted two brothers after he suc-
cessfully fought to overturn Flori-
da's three-decade old ban on gay
adoptions.
Martin Gill and his partner
were the boys' foster parents for
six years before the adoption was
finalized yesterday.
Gill and the American Civil Lib-
erties Union filed a lawsuit against
the state, calling the ban unconsti-

tutional. The 3rd District Court of
Appeal agreed in a ruling last year.
The state decided not to appeal.
The prohibition was enacted in
1977 and court records indicate it's
the only law of its kind in the Unit-
ed States.
The Department of Children
and Families changed its forms
so adoptive parents aren't asked if
they're homosexuals.
SAO PAULO, Brazil
Brazil police look
into death of priest
from United States
SAO PAULO (AP) - Authorities
are trying to determine if a U.S.
Jesuit priest found dead in north-
eastern Brazil committed suicide or
was killed.
The nude body of Ferdinand
Azevedo, 72, a professor at a local
university, was found on Monday in
his room at a spiritual retreat near
the city of Recife, capital of Per-
nambuco state, said police inspec-
tor Morgana Alves.
Alves was one of the first police
officers to enter the room where
Azevedo's body was found, in
a kneeling position and in an
advanced state of decomposition.
Azevedo's left hand was tied
behind his back with a cord that
went around his waist, she said in a
telephone interview. A metal chain
was wrapped around his neck. The
body showed no signs of violence
and nothing was stolen from Aze-
vedo's room.

High school
increases security
following shooting
LOS ANGELES (AP) - Security
officers wielding metal detecting
wands meticulously searched stu-
dents yesterday as they waited in a
longline outside a Los Angeles high
school where twol5-year-olds were
shot in a classroom a day earlier.
The stepped-up security mea-
sures come after a 9 mm semiau-
tomatic handgun being carried in
a backpack by a 10th-grader dis-
charged Tuesday when he put the
bag down on a desk at Gardena
High School, authorities said.
A bullet pierced a boytinche neck,
exited, and hit a girl in the head.
The boy was doing well yesterday,
while the girl remained in serious
condition with a skull fracture.
The girl regained consciousness
and could move her body after sur-
gery to remove a blood clot from
her brain caused by the bullet's
impact, said Julie Rees, spokes-
woman for Los Angeles County
Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. The
boy was expected to be discharged
last night, Rees said.
The 17-year-old suspect, who
was already on probation for a fight
at school, was arrested. Police said
two other students were also taken
into custody for investigation of
concealing evidence.,

A boy traded clothes with the
fleeing suspect, and a girl took
the backpack, police Detective A.
Batris said.
In an unrelated incident, author-
ities said a bulletproof vest saved
the life of a Los Angeles school
police officer who was shot yester-
day as he confronted a man who
appeared to breaking into cars
near El Camino Real High School
in Woodland Hills. Also yesterday,
a 16-year-old boy was shot in a res-
taurant parking lot near his high
school in the Los Angeles suburb
of Bell, authorities said. The Bell
High School student was shot once
in the abdomen, but his vital signs
appeared good when he was taken
to a hospital, Bell police Captain
Anthony Miranda said.
A preliminary investigation
determined the lone shot came
from a pickup truck that sped away
after the shooting, Miranda said.
Authorities were questioning a per-
son of interest in the case Wednes-
day evening. There have been no
arrests.
Police Chief Charlie Beck said
the man got out of a car and fired
several times, hitting the officer at
least once in the chest. A manhunt
was under way.
Security experts and school offi-
cials say it is almost impossible to
completely prevent students from
bringing guns onto school campus-
es, but there are basic precautions
that should be followed, including
random metal-detecting checks.

Egyptian leaders
look at societal issues
in light of Tunisian
overthrow
CAIRO (AP) - Though he still
delivers a speech like an aloof
corporate executive announc-
ing quarterly profits, the son and
presumptive heir of Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak is busy
remolding his image into a popu-
list who can deliver prosperity
for the struggling population in
this key U.S. ally.
Gamal Mubarak, 46, may have
made the switch none too soon.
The popular uprising that
toppled Tunisia's authoritar-
ian president this month has
exposed the risk Arab regimes
run if they don't work fast to
tackle such potentially explosive
economic ills like unemployment
and rising prices of food and
other basic goods.
The gravity of the threat fac-
ing them was bluntly put by the
Arab League's outspoken head
Amr Moussa in an address yes-
terday. "The Tunisian revolution
is not far from us. The Arab citi-
zen entered an unprecedented
state of anger and frustration,"
he warned, addressing Arab
leaders meeting in Egypt.
Tunisia, ironically, was an
economic darling of the West
and cited as a model for other
Arab states. But it came with an
unsteady foundation: high unem-
ployment, corruption and tight
controls on freedoms.
Egypt, largely following eco-
nomic policies initiated and
pushed by Gamal, also has seen
high growth rates, but they have
yet to trickle down to average

Egyptians who have endured
soaring prices.
The economy is the strongest
card that Gamal holds in his bid
to succeed his father as leader
since he has little popular base
and no experience in the military,
the source of Egypt's presidents
since the end of the monarchy
nearly 60 years ago.
But now all Arab leaders feel
increasing pressure to address
poverty and social ills head-on.
The ambitious economic
reforms Gamal has engineered
in the 10 years since he launched
his political career have fueled
strong growth but largely failed
to improve the lot of the poor
majority of Egyptians, benefiting
mostly the small clique of busi-
nessmen surrounding him.
At a recent ruling party con-
ference, Gamal sought to strike
a man-of-the-people persona,
touting his experiences touring
rural areas and speaking to ordi-
nary folks.
"The concerns, problems of
Egyptians and the need to raise
their standard of living will
remain and continue to be our
main preoccupation and the piv-
otal part of our party's endeav-
ors," he told party delegates in a
nationally televised speech last
month.
Gamal's father has ruled
Egypt for almost three decades,
and uncertainty over the lead-
ership's future has never been
higher. The 82-year-old Mubarak
underwent gallbladder surgery
last year, raising questions about
his health.
The elder Mubarak has not yet
said whether he will run in presi-
dential elections this fall as many
political analysts believe he will.
If his father does run - but is
unable to finish another six-year

term - the picture gets murkier.
Gamal would still be the main
potential replacement, but he
faces opposition among some in
the old guard of the ruling party
and the military who question
whether he has the political and
security clout to run the coun-
try.
The elder Mubarak, a former
air force chief, has built a reputa-
tion as a strong hand, especially
with his ruthless suppression of
an Islamic militant insurgency in
the 1990s.
Gamal, in contrast, may look
like a lightweight to some party
hands. One close ally inthe party,
Gehad Ouda, disputes that, argu-
ing that any president grows into
the position.
"Once you're strategically
positioned in the job of the
president, you take. charge,"
said Ouda, a senior member of
the party's Policy Committee,
headed by Gamal. "Being effec-
tive on security issues is among
the requirements of the job and
it's something you acquire on the
job."
As he leaped up the ranks of
the National Democratic Party
over the years, the younger
Mubarak has avoided confirm-
ing or categorically denying he
intends to seek the presidency.
The most concrete sign came
last year, when thousands of
posters went up around Cairo
touting him as the best choice for
future president - but the cam-
paign, believed linked to party
members, fizzled.
His credentials as the guide
of Egypt's economy suffered a
setback when food prices soared
in 2008 and street protests over
low wages, unemployment and a
higher cost of living grew in fre-
quency.

U.s . earning reports
show improvements

Banks report
economic growth
among Americans
NEW YORK (AP) - Americans
are starting to get their household
finances in order.
In an encouraging round of
earnings reports, major banks say
fewer mortgages are going bad,
credit card defaults are down and
morepeople are payingthe bilIs on
time.
One of the nation's largest con-
sumer lenders, Wells Fargo, said
yesterday that 29 percent fewer
loans went bad in the last three
monthsof2010thantheyear before.
And late payments on loans consid-
ered likely to default declined for
the first time since 2008.
Late payments on credit cards
issued by Bank of America, JPM-
organ Chase and Citigroup also
improved at a record pace at the
end of last year, according to an
analysis by Barclays Capital.
The reports are a sign that.
Americans are feeling more com-
fortable about their finances. Per-
sonal spending powers about 70
percent of the U.S. economy, and
most economists say a fiscally fit
consumer is critical to a strong eco-
nomic recovery.

"There are signs of stability
and growth," said JPMorgan CEO
Jamie Dimon.
The bank news comes after a
holiday shopping season in which
spending was the strongest since
2006, and auto sales grew 11 per-
cent last year, the first gains since
2005.
Taken together, the spending
indicators are the "strongest show-
ing for consumers since the peak
years of the last expansion," and
signal that the economy is "near
a threshold of self-sustaining
growth," analysts at Citi Invest-
ment Research & Analysis said in a
report earlier this month.
Economists and policymakers
are waiting for signs that the eco-
nomic recovery can power itself
rather than rely on outside sup-
ports, like the Fed's decision to buy
hundreds of billions of dollars in
government bonds to drive down
interest rates.
The recent bank results are fuel-
ing that optimism.
Citigroup said loan losses fell 11
percent from the previous quarter
as more of its customers kept up
with payments.
It was the sixth straight quarter
of declining losses, allowing the
bank to release $2.3 billion from the
reserves it sets aside for bad loans
and helping it to report a profit.


Vatican denies tellin
not to report suspec

Catholic Church
officials: Uncovered
1997 letter is
'misunderstood'
VATICAN CITY (AP) - In a
new round of damage control, the
Vatican insisted yesterday sus-
pected of sex abuse to police had
been "deeply misunderstood."
The Associated Press on Tues-
day reported the contents of the
letter, in which the Vatican's top
diplomat in Ireland told bishops
that their policy of mandatory
reporting such cases to police
"gives rise to serious reserva-
tions of both a moral and canoni-
cal nature."
The newly revealed letter,
obtained originally by Irish
broadcaster RTE from an Irish
bishop, has undermined persis-
tent Vatican claims, particularly
when seeking to defend itself in
U.S. lawsuits, that Rome never
told bishops not to cooperate
with police.
An Irish government-ordered
investigation into decades of
abuse cover-ups in the Dublin
Archdiocese concluded that Irish
bishops understood the letter to
mean they shouldn't report sus-
pected crimes.
And victims groups say it's a
"smoking gun" that shows that
the church enforced a worldwide
culture of concealing crimes by
pedophile priests of which Rome
bears ultimate - and legal -
responsibility.
"The letter confirms that the
cover-up goes as far as the Vati-
can, that Vatican officials knew

exactly what was going on, and
that they proactively sought to
deter Irish bishops from coop-
erating with civil authorities in
Ireland," said Andrew Madden, a
former Dublin altar boy who was
raped repeatedly by a priest, Ivan
Payne, in the 1980s.
"This letter also documents
how the church remained of the
view that it is a law unto itself,
how its rules and regulations
regarding the handling of a crimi-
nal offense take precedence over
civil society's laws," said Madden,
who in 1995 became the first vic-
tim in Ireland to go public with a
lawsuit against the church.
Yesterday, the Vatican insisted
the 1997 letter was only intended
to emphasize that Irish bishops
must follow church law meticu-
lously. The Vatican spokesman,
the Rev. Federico Lombardi, said
the Holy See wanted to ensure
that pedophile priests wouldn't
have any technical grounds to
escape church punishment on
appeal.
It by no means instructed bish-
ops to disregard civil reporting
requirements about abuse, added
the Vatican's U.S. lawyer, Jeffrey
Lena, who said the letter had
been "deeply misunderstood" by
the media.
At the time, there were no
such reporting requirements in
Ireland. In fact, the Irish bishops
were ahead of Irish lawmakers
in pledging cooperation with law
enforcement as dioceses were hit
with the first lawsuits by victims
of abusive priests.
Yet as a result of the 1997 let-
ter, most Irish dioceses never
implemented the 1996 commit-
ment to report all suspected

g bishops
ted abuse
abuse cases to police, according
to the conclusions of the gov-
ernment-mandated investiga-
tion into the Dublin Archdiocese
published in 2009.
"This in fact never took place
because of the response of
Rome," the commission said in its
report, although it quoted Dublin
Archdiocese officials as saying it
was implemented there.
That eight-year inquiry inter-
viewed two senior Dublin Arch-
diocese canon lawyers involved
in handling abuse complaints.
They were quoted as saying the
letter discouraged bishops from
pursuing their 1996 initiative for
fear of being overruled by Rome,
as had already happened in one
notorious case of a serial pedo-
phile.
The AP has requested inter-
views with both officials, Mon-
signors Alex Stenson and John
Dolan. But the Dublin Arch-
diocese said yesterday that no
officials would be available to
comment on either the 2009
investigation or the publication
of the Vatican's 1997 letter.
In that letter, Pope John Paul
II's diplomat to Ireland, Arch-
bishop Luciano Storero, told
the Irish bishops that their 1996
policy contained procedures that
appeared to contradict canon
law and stressed the need to fol-
low that law "meticulously" or
risk having their canonical trials
overturned on appeal.
They noted that the Vatican
has consistently ignored letters
from several Irish investigations
seeking church documents, such
as the 1997 letter, that would
shed light on the scope of Catho-
lic child abuse and any cover-up.

Snyder's one-point plan
The governor shouldn't only focus on economy
espite media speculation, Republican Gov. Rick Snyder
didn't indicate any plans to make the University private
in his State of the State address last night. In fact, Snyder
barely mentioned the University. His speech focused heavily on
his plans for the economy, explaining that "job one is jobs" and his
plan to support Michigan businesses. While repairing the economy
is a top priority and his economic platform appears thorough and
well planned, Snyder only elaborated on one point of his five-point
"Michigan dashboard." Though his speech was optimistic for Mich-
igan's business industry, Snyder needs to ensure that other sectors
- particularly education - aren't neglected.

Planning for the perfect storm

Snyder delivered his first State of the
State address in Lansing on Wednesday
night. Snyder spoke in detail about mea-
suring the state's performance through
a report card that would gauge the state's
success. He presented a tool for monitor-
ing the state's progress that he called the
"Michigan dashboard," which incorporates
21 measures in five key areas. In his speech,
Snyder listed the components of the Michi-
gan Dashboard as: economic growth, value
for government, quality of life, public safe-
ty and health and education.
Snyder is clearly focused and enthusi-
astic about his plans for the economy. He
began his speech by stating, "Economic
development is the focus of the night." In
talking about plans for developing Michi-
gan, he indicated his plans to eliminate the
controversial Michigan business tax and
replace it with a 6-percent corporate net
income tax. Snyder also expressed his sup-
port for a second downriver bridge - a joint
project with the Canadian government that
will hopefully foster international trade.
These plans have the potential to help grow
Michigan businesses and bring people to'
th1e state.,
Though the economy is obviously a pri-
ority, there are other pressing issues for the
state. And while Snyder described them as
part of his Michigan dashboard, he went

into no detail about the future of the pub-
lic sector, the environment or social issues.
Snyder mentioned his support for environ-
mental projects and expanding the Univer-
sity Research Corridor so that it's accessible
for all students in Michigan, but he failed to
explain how he would do so. It's troubling
that these topics and programs received so
little attention compared to the economy.
An obvious concern for students was also
glossed over last night - the future of educa-
tion in Michigan. Snyder briefly mentioned
that the emphasis should be on P-20 edu-
cation - an education system that includes
pre-natal through college - and that he
plans to address education in April. But with
potential cuts to public education fund-
ing in the new budget, administrators need
to be informed further in advance of their
school's financial status. Snyder focused on
the importance of retaining young people
after they graduate, but he needs to ensure
that resources remain available for current
Michigan students as well.
Though Snyder's economic plans were
positive, it's concerning that describing them
took nearly the entire hour. The state has too
many problems for Snyder to afford the kind
of one-dimensional approach that his speech
exhibited last night. He needs to make sure
that all Michigan issues are given the focus
they deserve.

Notorious for its earthquakes
and Prop 19 - the state of
California could be in for
another major
disappointment.
Scientists and
government offi-
cials are cur-
rently bracing
for a storm that
has the potential
to be far more
devastating than
any earthquake JOE
and is as much
of a buzz-killas SUGIYAMA
a Slayer album.
Last Thursday,
the United States Geological Sur-
vey released its findings concerning
a "superstorm" that could devastate
California. This storm could poten-
tially cause damages up to $300 bil-
lion.
For those of you who may be quick
to jump on the global warming band-
wagon, bear in mind that this has
happened before - quite a few times
actually. The most recent California
superstorm took place in 1861. That
storm lasted for more than one month
and flooded California so severely
that the state capital was temporarily
moved to San Francisco once Sacra-
mento had been turned into an island.
Scientists estimate that storms of this
same magnitude had hit the Golden
State at least six times prior to the
storm in 1861.
These storms are caused by atmo-
spheric rivers, which are massive
jets of warm air that contain large
amounts of moisture and cause exten-
siVe flooding due to extreme rain and
wind. By observing sediment buried
in the coastal regions of California,
researchers have been able to get
a good grasp on how these storms

work. Using this information, engi-
neers working for the USGS created
computer-generated models that pre-
dict how the superstorm will act. The
USGS has also laid out plans of action
that state and federal officials can use
in their preparations for an impend-
ing storm.
I mentioned earlier that you
shouldn't be too quick to blame this
situation on global warming, but it
shouldn't be discounted entirely.
Increases in temperatures can accel-
erate the development of the atmo-
spheric riversjust as theincreases can
cause more extreme weather patterns
throughout the world. But because
this isn't California's first encounter
with a superstorm, it's not unreason-
able to believe that this particular
storm isn't entirely the fault of green-
house gases.
As we all witnessed with Hurri-
cane Katrina, there are some major
implications of massive floods. Power
outages, loss of communication tools,
landslides and polluted water sup-
plies are some of the many problems
- as noted by the USGS - which
California residents would face as a
result of such a storm. Perhaps the
most important section of the USGS's
report concerns the evacuation of
the affected areas. The approximate
number of people who would have to
be evacuated due to flooding is esti-
mated to be about 1.5 million. It seems
that swift action - that we didn't see
with Hurricane Katrina - might be
the key to saving many lives.
Our government has a tendency to
sluggishly address important issues,
especially those pertaining to the
'environment. But because we have
seen this scenario play out in the past,
California government officials need
to make sure the state doesn't suffer
the same fate as New Orleans. Now

there are certainly some extenuating
circumstances that make Hurricane
Katrina something of an anomaly
- including shoddy levees and the
inherent risks of costal cities - but
that doesn't mean there is nothing to
be learned from the experience.
A "superstorm"
could devastate
California.
According to the report issued by
the USGS, the storm currently predi-
cated is a scenario "of catastroph-
ic proportions for which existing
national and state disaster policies
are ill-suited." Because of the magni-
tude of this storm and the potential
flooding of California's entire Cen-
tral Valley region - a 300 by 20 mile
area - there is simply not a plan to
safeguard citizens from this storm.
If we thought that we were unpre-
pared for the breaking of a few levees
in one city, I shudder to think of how
ill-equipped we are for the potential
flooding and evacuation of 22 Califor-
nia cities.
The bottom line is that without
proper planning and forethought
many lives could be lost. The writing
is on the walls - or perhaps locked
in layers of sediment - and we know
that there is a good chance that a
superstorm could devastate the state
of California. I think the federal gov
ernm ent should do its best ta not get
caught with its pants down this time.

Without a Blood Alcohol Content of .10, it
can be tricky to get up the nerve to ask out that
"perfect 10" in your chemistry lecture. Fortu-
nately for all the Nervous Nellies and Shy Ron-
nies across campus, maintaining your virginity
is no longer the only option. LikeALittle.com,
a website launched on Oct. 25, aims to help the
meek, the mild and the all-around creepy avoid
another Friday night alone watching Full House
reruns.
According to a Jan. 14 article in the Michigan
Daily, LikeALittle's CEO and co-founder Evan
Reas hopes to build "a social network where
people around each other, can connect" - a
novel concept, no doubt. But if you ask me, Reas
was being modest. LikeALittle is a platform
for modern Edgar Allan Poes and 21st century
Elizabeth Barrett Brownings to bear their souls,
as evidenced by three recent posts on the site's
University of Michigan page:
"Female, blonde. 5'3, skinny, does kegstands.
I saw you at a frat party doing a kegstand. I was
impressed...vour hot. Hit me up."
"Male, Brunette. You were jump-roping after
you ran. Nice endurance."
"Female, blonde. You were barfing outside a
party of State Street. It was gross."
And they say romance is dead.
Of course, this isn't the first instance when
the Internet has served as a breeding ground
for love connections. Back when we were still
watching Recess, our weird uncles were using
online dating websites to, well, let's face it,
embellish their various accomplishments and
embrace perhaps lackluster physical appear-
ances in hopes of scoring a date ("Middle-aged
man with 'more to love' seeks chubby chaser").
What makes LikeALittle standout is of course
the anonymous factor - the ability for users to
hide behind the screen names the site selects, all
named after fruit.
Now, I'm not concerned with the site's effects
on flirting and relationships. Despite the fact
that Reas describes the site as a "flirting facilita-
tor platform," it's fairly obvious that most users
use LikeALittle as a stage for a battle of wits,
as anonymous posters try to out-clever fellow
users with academic innuendos ("I'd like to light
your Bunsen burner") and deliberate placement
of Ke$ha lyrics. The real concern? The website
is a breeding ground for narcissism and has the

potential to feed into our generation's already
massive ego.
For years, psychologists have claimed that
the moderncollege student is becoming increas-
ingly self-absorbed, which has led to people
coining a slew of new titles for Generation Y -
Generation 'N' for narcissism, Generation Me
or simply "brats." In 2009, USA Today report-
ed that 57 percent of college students polled
believed that social networking sites fueled self-
promotion and narcissism, while two-thirds of
students surveyed said our generation was more
egocentric than any other. Two years later, that
percentage is most likely on the rise, and anony-
mous sites such as LikeALittle and Formspring
are sure to up the ego ante.
My fears of the growing generational egotism
were elevated as I overhead students in the East
Quad cafeteria while they were huddled around
a laptop as they scrolled through the site.
"Oh my God, male, brunette, green shirt - I
was wearing a green shirt two days ago!"
"Wait, wait - beautiful, blonde, female, in the
Bursely dining hall? Do you think that's me?!"
"You guys, this is so creepy....Hey, wait, scroll
back up. Female, brown hair, reading a book? Is
my hair brown? I was totally reading yesterday."
The group of students continued to refresh
the website, hoping that someone, somewhere
- whether it was iii Angell Hall or outside of a
bathroom at the UGLi - had noticed them.
Now, there's nothing wrong with the occa-.
sional ego boost, but we're starting to go too
far. Through the compulsive use of social net-
working sites, our generation is taking compli-
ment fishing to a whole new level. Ifa day goes
by without a single Facebook notification, it's
almost as if we've been cast off by society. And
now with LikeALittle, students peruse the web-
site and become offended if they aren't men-
tioned in the hundreds of posts - despite the
fact we go to a university with more than 40,000
students who could just as easily be described as
"brunette, eating lunch in Mojo." Do we really
need the constant attention? Isn't ita little self-
absorbed to assume -
Oh, wait, what's this - "female, blonde, glass-
es, creeping in EQ South Cafe" - OMG, do you
think that's me?

a "home" game against Alabama in
Cowboys Stadium in 2012. And as a
University regent, Brandon support-
ed a $226 million expansion of the
stadium - a position that alienated
many traditionalists and may have
played a role in his defeat when he
ran for re-election in 2006.
Given all this, it's tempting to call
Rich Rodriguez a kindred spirit. Upon
becoming Michigan's head football
coach after the 2007 season, Rodri-
guez, like Brandon, showed respect -
in most cases - for the proud historyof
the winningest college football team of
all time while also rejecting the notion
that he couldn't make significant
changes. He set out to builda new kind
of Michigan football team, one cen-
tered on his innovative spread offense
that had inspired praise and imitation
among other college coaches while he
was at West Virginia University.
But Brandon has something Rich
Rod never seemed to have earned:
"Michigan Man" status. That's right,
Brandon holds just about the most
meaningless distinction ever, the
central piece of a philosophy that says

one is only worthy of the University
if he has lived in Ann Arbor and had
some association with the Wolver-
ines in the past.l
There are apparently a good deal ofi
Michigan fans and supporters who arec
preoccupied with this charming but
ultimately limiting ideal. And no one
seems to mind that the quintessential
Michigan Man - legendary football
coach Bo Schembechler - wasn't aj
Michigan Man when he came to town..
He became one through success on
the football field.
In his handling of Rodriguez's dis-1
missal, the coaching search and the
eventual hiring of Brady Hoke, Bran-
don has only reinforced the Michigan]
Man hang-up. But I don't think rever-1
ence for tradition drove him. Instead,
he saw an opportunity in which tradi-
tion happened to align with his main]
area of concern.
Schembechler, for whom Brandon
was a backup quarterback, had a sin-
gle focus: The Team, The Team, The
Team. For Brandonit's The Brand.
In speeches and interviews, he
can't stop referring to The Brand. It's
entirely appropriate, even vital, for
the boss of the Athletic Department
to embrace marketing. But he has
treated the program like a corpora-
tion with an image problem instead
of a football team with a football
problem.
During a press conference follow-
ing Rodriguez's firing, Brandon was
asked to prioritize the characteristics
of his ideal replacement candidate.
First was "a clear understanding of
what the University of Michigan is all
about." Second, a "spokesperson for
the University," because "Michigan
athletics is the front door to the Uni-
versity of Michigan in terms of the
brand and the shaping of the brand."
And finally, someone who can "com-
pete at the highest level."
That all came before acknowledg-
ing that the new coach ought to be a
worthy leader for a group of young
athletes who moved to Ann Arbor'
from all over the country because of

the guy he just sent packing.
Brandon sees the Michigan Man
as the cornerstone of the Michigan
Brand. So with Rodriguez flailing in
the tail end of his third season, Bran-
don sought to score a grand slam for
the Wolverines' slouching reputation.
We may never know the full story of
the coaching search, but as I interpret
what has been reported, Brandon pri-
marily pursued three Michigan Men:
Jim Harbaugh, Les Miles and Brady
Hoke, in that order.
By presumably holding out for Har-
baugh because his Stanford team had a
January bowl, Brandon left players in
the lurch and recruits feeling uneasy.
He acknowledged that this could've
had a detrimental effect on recruiting.
And in settling on Brady Hoke after
evidently failing to land the first two,
Brandon raised questions about his
priorities.
AD capitalized on
"Michigan Man
hang-up.
Hoke deserves every Michigan fan's
support. He is praised widely by those
who know him and have worked with
him, and skepticism related to his
record as a head coach (47-50) is easily
discredited by recent history - Gene
Chizik, who just coached Auburn to
a national championship, had a 5-19
head coaching record when the school
hired him three years ago.
Michigan fans can only hope that
Brandon picked Hoke for who he is,
not what he symbolizes. Time will tell
whether Brandon sold short the single
most beloved tradition in Michigan
football: winning.

imminent move to repeal the law international students studying at
doesn't hold much weight since the the University.

Since the domestic plan isn't
required, premiums are significant-
ly higher than those of the inter-
national plan, which is $99 dollars
per month compared to $224.83 per
month for the domestic plan.
"Unfortunately (the domestic
plan is) a bit expensive because
many young people don't buy
health insurance," Winfield said.
"There's adverse selection so the
price goes up because it's all based
on the types of claims submitted."
According to Burchett, the
domestic plan is available to any
University student taking at least
one credit. The plan is typically
purchased by students whose par-
ents don't have health insurance or
students who don't qualify for cov-
erage under their parents' plans.

Even for students who are on
their parents' health insurance
plans, there may be a discrepancy
between the coverage out-of-state
students receive at home and the
coverage they have in Ann Arbor.
According to Winfield, a student
who has "great" health insurance
in California may not be eligible
for the same level of coverage in
Michigan. Therefore, purchasing
the University's domestic plan may
sometimes result in better cover-
age, he said.
Though the University's health
insurance plans must comply with
any changes in federal law for
2011, Burchett said the University
isn't likely to have to make many
adjustments to either its domestic
or international plans for students.


CAREER EXPO
From Page 1A
job positions.
"It's a great chance to see what is
out there," Schueneman said. "It's
the first step in that internship or
job that you want."
Many University seniors attend-
ed the expo with the chief goal of
finding possible jobs, while others
focused on networking and intern-
ship searches.
LSA seniors Sara Bennett and
Lindsey Etterbeek said they went to
the expo with hopes of finding a job
for after they graduate.
Kinesiology senior Dwayne Riley
said the expo was helpful and that
he attended in order to follow up
with prospective employers he met
at the Fall Career Expo.
"I came to the one in the fall, and
it was pretty helpful, so I wanted to
follow up in the winter to show my
face before applying to desired posi-
tions," Riley said.
Engineering sophomore Brad

Rock, a first-time expo attendee,
said he felt the expo was a great
opportunity, though he was some-
what nervous to talk with company
representatives. He said he would
encourage other students to give it
a try even if they're apprehensive.
"You feel uneasy at first, but ask
good questions, and don't be too
nervous," Rock said. "And try not to
view every opportunity as the end
of the world, if it goes badly."
Though many students said they
found the expo helpful, some stu-
dents said it didn't meet expecta-
tions.
. Business School junior Sara
Jablow said the event wasn't com-
pletely accommodating. She said
she felt the fair could have been bet-
ter organized and that it was hard
to tell what skills companies really
wanted.
"The other career expos that I
have been to were more special-
ized," Jablow said.
LSA senior Sarah Avellar said
there weren't a lot of choices for
students, adding that the potential

employers were targeted to stu-
dents interested in business.
"This one was useless for me,"
Avellar said. "It wasn't as individu-
alized."
When asked if they favored non-
profit or governmental jobs over
careers with for-profit organiza-
tions, many students said they pre-
fer corporate jobs. Business School
junior Colin Buck said he would like
to work for a corporate organiza-
tion instead of a non-profit because
he finds corporate companies tobe
more driven.
"(Corporate companies are)
more motivated," Buck said. "Non-
profits are friendly, but they lack
motivation."
Some students, however, said
they would rather work for a non-
profit organization.
University alum Brittany Moore
said she didn't even walk into the
room with the corporate organiza-
tions and that she was sold on the
non-profits.
"I walked in the Pendleton
Room, with the corporations, and I

was like, 'no, wrong room,"' Moore
said.
LSAsenior AbiolaOmishope said
the expo prompted competition
between students, and encouraged
self-determination.
"It was helpful because you get
to gauge how competition really
works, how to present yourself
and how to be self-competitive,"
Omishope said.
When asked what they thought
of the job hunt, many students
interviewed, including LSA senior
Jessica Zelvin, said it is a tough yet
manageable task if students put in
the work.
"(It is) overwhelming (and) frus-
trating but possible," Zelvin said.
"It's challenging, but if you give
great consideration, and effort, you
will find what you're looking for."
After the expo, Schueneman said
she received positive feedback from
the employers who attended.
"(The employers) seemed to be
impressed with the quality of the
students (and) with the profession-
alism of the students," she said.


CLINICS
From Page 1A
New Jersey ruling that exempted
public university clinics from sub-
mitting to open records requests.
No such ruling currently exists in
Michigan regarding the relation-
ship between the open records
requests and clinics associated with
public higher education institu-
tions.
The New Jersey ruling involved
the Rutgers School of Law Envi-
ronmental Law Clinic, which
has submitted a brief to the New.-
Jersey State Supreme Court call-
ing fo'' a-repeal of the'decision.
Founded in 1985, Rutgers Univer-
sity law students work at the Envi-
ronmental Law Clinic to solve
issues involving building permits,
waste transfer and water and air
pollution, according to the clinic's
website.
Frank Askin, director of the
Rutgers School of Law Constitu-
tional Litigation Clinic, said he
expects the New Jersey Supreme
Court to decide whether to hear
the case in the next couple of
weeks. He said submitting to open
records requests would be harm-
ful to the operation of university
clinics because clients could no
longer expect their information to
be safeguarded against becoming
public knowledge.
"It would be very harmful to
clinical education at public law
schools if (the October New Jer-
sey ruling) became the law," Askin

said. "It would open us up to all
kinds of harassment."
The Rutgers Environmental
Law Clinic is more like a public
defender office since it is funded
in part by the state but doesn't
exclusively work for the state,
Askin said. Many of the cases the
clinic takes on are against the
state, Askin said, so treating the
clinic like a state employee is con-
fusing.
"The whole thing is ridiculous,"
Askin said. "It doesn't make sense."
While a co-chair of a subcom-
mitteeoftheAmericanAssociation
of Law Schools, Bridget McCor-.
mack, now co-director of the Uni-
versity of Michigan Law' School's
Innocence Clinic, worked on a
legal brief in defense of the Rutgers
Environmental Law Clinic.
McCormack said the Innocence
Clinic functions like a private law
firm and should be treated as such.
The New Jersey ruling under-
mines the confidentiality clients
should expect from the office rep-
resenting them, she said.
McCormack said she fears that
with such legislation, the oppos-
ing council in many cases could
use open records requests as road-
blocks.
"I don't think the rule is appro-
priate for any law practice because
it doesn't allow us to practice law
ethically," McCormack said. "The
ethical practice of law requires
that we be able to promise our cli-
ents confidentiality, and you can't
do that because you happen to be
subject to a state open records law."

But McCormack also said Court appellate division denied a

SCHOOLS

University and Ann Arbor, as well
as campus resources," Elgas said.
Similarly, to increase undergrad-
uate interest, the School of Public
Health sets up lectures and presen-
tations on health issues, offering
undergraduate students opportu-
nities to communicate face-to-face
with public health representatives,
according to Kiran Dhiman, stu-
dent admissions coordinator in the
School of Public Health.
"Michigan graduates are well-
prepared, strong candidates for our
graduate programs," Dhiman said.
"We've increased our on-campus
recruitment efforts as a result."
The number of applicants to
the School of Public Health yhas
increased steadily since 2008, Dhi-
man wrote in an e-mail interview.
In 2008, there were about 1,650
applicants, in 2009 there were
about 1,825 applicants and in 2010
there were approximately 2,100
applicants to the school, according
to Dhiman. Though 2011 admis-
sions are still open, Dhiman wrote
that numbers currently "appear to
be slightly ahead of last year."
Similarly, Sarah Zearfoss, the
assistant dean and director of
admissions at the Law School,
wrote in an e-mail interview that
there was a "large uptick" in appli-
cations for the 2009 admissions
cycle when nearly 6,500 students
applied. This increase came after
the Law School's application num-
' bers held steady between 5,500 and

6,000 applicants a year since 2002,
she wrote.
"It seems that this year, we'll be
on the high end of our usual range,
and that's exactly where we'd like
to be," Zearfoss wrote. "It's a large
enough pool that we have an enor-
mous amount of talent to choose
among, but not so large that there
are a lot of unrealistic applicants."
Each class is composed of about
360 students, accordingto Zearfoss.
Zearfoss also wrote that the Law
School seeks incoming students not
just from the University's under-
graduate student body, but from all
over the United States as well.
"We recruit nationally, travel-
ing around the country to our top
feeder schools and reaching out to
prospectives across the nation," she
wrote.
Some graduate and professional
schools on campus like the Law
School even offer special incentives
for University undergraduates to
apply. The Law School's Wolverine
Scholars Program allows highly
qualified University students to
apply to the school without taking
the LSAT.
Zearfoss said the new program,
first started in fall 2008, is promis-
ing for University undergraduates
and the school.
"The program is in its infancy,
but we're very enthusiastic about
the caliber of people it has brought
our way," Zearfoss said.
LSA senior Andrew Lieberman,
who recently applied to the Law
School and the Wolverine Scholars
Program, said the new program has
helped him in the application pro-

cess.
"The school seemed very eager
to keep Michigan's best under-
grads wishing to go to law school,"
Lieberman said. "It allowed the
Law School to know that I was very
interested in them once the regular
admission cycle rolled around."
Zearfoss echoed this idea and
said the Law School's awareness of
the intimacies of an undergraduate
education at the University typi-
cally help applicants.
"Our familiarity with the
strength of various (University)
programs and our relationships
with faculty in other parts of the
University always help Michigan
undergrads," Zearfoss said. "It
means we take some non-obvious
candidates very seriously when in
(the) absence of key'insider info' we
might not know."
Like the Law School's Wolver-
ine Scholars Program, the School
of Social Work has an optional
preferred admissions program for
entering freshmen who already
know they want to pursue gradu-
ate-level studies in the social work
field. The option has been avail-
able since 1987, but recently, the
Preferred Admissions program has
gained popularity for undergradu-
ates, Erin Zimmer, the assistant
director of Student Services in the
School of Social Work, said.
Zimmer said only a small amount
of applicants apply via the Pre-
ferred Admissions Program their
freshman year. She speculated that
the current economic situation has
contributed to the increasing inter-
est in the school by leading more

students to go to graduate school
instead of heading straight to the
job hunt.
The School of Social Work has
seen an increase of more than 250
applicants from the 2009 admis-
sions cycle to the 2010 admissions
cycle, according to Zimmer.
"We think the economy is con-
tributing (to the increase in appli-
cants)," Zimmer said. "A lot of
students want to advance them-
selves to be competitive in the job
market."
LSA senior Talyah Sands is cur-
rently participating in an overlap
graduate program, called the 4+1
Program, at the School of Public
Health. She is currently complet-
ing her psychosocial health major,
which she created through the
University's Individual Concentra-
tion Program. The program allows
seniors to begin their graduate
degree during their senior year, with
credits overlapping between under-
graduate and graduate studies.
"A huge advantage ofthe 4+1 Pro-
gram is the opportunity to dive into
my desired field of study as I fin-
ish up my undergraduate degree,"
Sands said. "Since I already knew
that I wanted to study public health,
it was niceto start takingcourses in
it right away during my senior year,
instead of just filling up my sched-
ule with miscellaneous credits."
She said her experience in this
dual program has been positive.
"The school is amazing, and it
is an honor to be able to learn from
some of the brightest and most
accomplished people in the field,"
Sands said.

creativity, and this enables us to
touch more lives of more consumers
in more parts of the world."
Though it was announced last
night, the partnership between
the URC and P&G hasn't yet been
finalized. According to Popyk, the
negotiations have been ongoing
for several months, and the deal is
expected to be finalized in Febru-
ary.
SNYDER TO CUT MICHIGAN
BUSINESS TAX
Snyder said in his speech that he
will eliminate the Michigan Busi-
ness Tax in his two-year budget
proposal to be submitted to the state
legislature in mid-February.
The governor added that he
hopes the legislature will have the
budget completed by May 31.
Snyder said he plans to replace
the "job-killing" business tax with
a 6 percent corporate income tax.
Repealing the business tax would
create a large revenue shortfall in
the state budget, but Snyder didn't
say how, or if, that shortfall would
be replaced.
Many, including Coleman, have
speculated that the state could cut
higher education funding in order

to balance the budget. But Cole-
man said it is too early in the budget
process to determine how potential
cuts would affect the University.
"(Snyder) has used the words
'shared sacrifice,'so I don't know yet
what this means," Coleman said. "I
know, though, that the governor has
a deep appreciation for the role of
universities in society and for access
for students, but it's just too earlyto
tell."
In an interview last week, Uni-
versity Provost Philip Hanlon said
the University plans several budgets
to prepare for however high or low
the state appropriation is.
"Gov. Snyder wants to reform
the business tax, which, in the
short run, will lower revenue even
lower (than it already is)," Hanlon
said. "So that leads to uncertainty.
It's quite certain that there will be
a gap between the current year's
expenditures and next year's rev-
enues for the state. So, what they
have to do is close that somehow,
and what we don't know is how
they'll do that."
In the current state budget,
signed into law by former Demo-
cratic Gov. Jennifer Granholm last
October, the University received
$316 million from the state - a
2.8-percent decrease from the pre-
vious year.
In the official Democratic
response to the State of the State

address, Senate Minority Leader
Gretchen Whitmer (D-East Lan-
sing) lambasted Snyder, saying that
eliminating the Michigan Business
Tax would create a budget hole that
would adversely affect government
services.
However, Whitmer said the Dem-
ocrats in the state legislature would
be willingto work with Snyder if the
proposed legislation is prudent, no
matter which party came up with
the plan.
"We are eager to take a look at
anything that really makes Michi-
gan more competitive and creates
jobs while protecting the things that
make our state great, like our educa-
tion and public safety," she said.
SNYDER VOWS TO IMPROVE,
UNIFY STATE
Echoing sentiments from his Jan.
1 inaugural address, Snyder pledged
to better the state by working with
Republicans and Democrats alike.
Throughout his speechlastnight,
Snyder discussed several plans to
create jobs and improve Michigan's
economy.
"The path to a bright future is
based on all of us contributing to the
solution," Snyder said. "Tonight, I
will start with specifics on the topic
of economic development. Simply
put - job one is jobs."
Snyder said he is forming a group

made of the Michigan Economic
Development Corp, the Michigan
Department of Transportation, the
Michigan State Housing Develop-
ment Authority and the Michigan
Department of Energy, Labor and
Economic Growth to help the state
bounce back from the recession and
produce more jobs.
He also announced his support
for the Detroit International River
Crossing project that would build a
second bridge spanning the Detroit
River toconnectDetroittoWindsor,
Ontario. Snyder said he brokered an
agreement with the Federal High-
way Administration last week in
Washington, D.C., in which the
federal government would match
the $550 million the Canadian gov-
ernment is supplying for the bridge
project.
Snyder proposed several other
programs to foster economic
growth including expanding the
scope of the MEDC and encourag-
ing educated foreign immigrants to
move to the state. He added that it
is the responsibility of all Micjgan-
ders to work together to move the
state forward.
"We can, and indeed we must,
begin right now to build a Michi-
gan where the next generation has
the chance to live, to work, to play,
to prosper," Snyder said. "So let's
roll up our shirt sleeves and get to
work."

Blue looking to
live up to higher
expectations

Michigan coach Kevin Borseth has guided the Wolverines to a 3-2 Big Ten record this season, including wins over No. 12 Ohio State and No, 14 Iowa.
'M'takes on pesky Wildcats

By CAITLIN SMITH
Daily Sports Writer
Coach Kevin Borseth has con-
tinuously emphasized that the
mentality of the Michigan women's
basketball team is to take the sea-
son one game at a
time.
"One play at a EI O
time, that's how at North-
you do it," Bors- wem
eth said after
practice last Matchup:
week. "We don't Northwestern
go to streaks and -5 chi-
we don't go to gan1-7
records, we go to When: Thurs-
the next play and day 9 P.M.
the next game. Where:
Every team pres- Welsh-Ryan
ents a different Arena
set of challenges,
so we've got to be able to prepare,
on both sides of those court, for
those challenges."
But after yet another defining
win this past weekend against
a Big Ten opponent, Wisconsin,
it's hard not to look at Thursday's
game against Northwestern as a
pivotal moment for the Wolverines

in conference play.
Michigan (3-2, 10-7) started off
its Big Ten season with consecutive
wins over conference frontrunners
No. 14 Iowa. and No. 12 Ohio State
contesting its reputation as a weak
team in the competitive league.
Coming into January, the Wolver-
ines stepped up their defensive
pressure early and were executing
shots at over 40 percent in both
games.
Michigan followed a hot start
withtwohard-foughtlosses to Pur-
due and Michigan State, leading up
to Sunday's 75-59 win against Wis-
consin. With the win, the Wolver-
ines have returned to above-.500 in
conference play and have an oppor-
tunity to prove against Northwest-
ern that their successful start in
the Big Ten was no fluke.
"Right now, we're on the fence,"
senior guard Veronica Hicks said
last week after practice. "We know
that we started off on the top, and
now we are neck-and-neck with a
lot of teams, so this is kind of where
... you start to realize if you're going
to be at the top or the bottom."
But Northwestern will not be an
easy stepping stone for Michigan,

who is looking to launch its season
into an upward swing. The Wild-
cats (3-3 Big Ten, 14-5 overall) have
been positioned as the surprise
team of the Big Ten since the pre-
season.
"It is no surprise to us coaches,
but Northwestern is going to be a
great team this year," Iowa coach
Lisa Bluder said in October. "The
perception is still that they are
toward the bottom of the Big Ten,
but they are a very good basketball
team, and they are well coached.
I think they are going to shock
everybody else."
And Northwestern has come
close, notching two conference
wins againstIllinois and Ohio State
and splitting two games against
Purdue. But even the Wildcats'
losses have been notable - com-
ing against Penn State, who is cur-
rently tied for the Big Ten lead, and
Indiana who sealed its two-point
win by finishing a layup with just
three seconds left in the game.
Northwestern is led by 6-foot-
5 senior center Amy Jaeschke,
who averages 22.8 points and 9.2
rebounds per game. Jaeschke is
a three-time All-Big Ten selec-

tion and is currently fifth in the
nation in blocked shots, with four
per game. Jaeschke is paired with
junior forward Brittany Orban,
who averages 12.4 shots and 6.9
rebounds a game and shoots just
under 50 percent from behind the
arc.
But on Thursday, the Wolverines
will not focus all their efforts on
defending Jaeschke. Rather, Mich-
igan will emphasize offensive pro-
duction of its own, having finished
0-6 this season when scoring less
than 60 points in a game. So that's
the plan: Put the ball in the basket.
"(Scoring is) being able to finish
on the block, penetrating and fin-
ishing around the basket," junior
guard Courtney Boylan said last
week. "It seems like we can really
get threes at any point, it's just tak-
ing good shots and getting the ball
around the rim to get easy shots."
If Michigan can successfully
execute on the offensive end of the
court, then the matchup against
Northwestern may prove to be
more than another game - it could
be another push in the right direc-
tion for the Wolverines' confer-
ence play.,

After impressive
2010 season, team
strives to earn
Big Ten title
By EMILY O'DONNELL
For the Daily
Boasting an overall 61-18
record, Michigan coach Ronni
Bernstein - the 2010 Big Ten
Coach of the Year - has set the
bar high for her fourth season at
the helm of the No. 8 Michigan
women's tennis team.
In just one year, Michigan's
preseason ranking has gone from
No. 19 to No. 8 in Division I.
As a result of having an out-
standing 2010 season, "the bar
has definitelybeen raised and the
expectations are greater," fresh-
man Sam Critser said.
Preparing to live up to these
expectations, the team is focused
and determined to perform well.
"We are pushing ourselves
harder," senior Rika Tatsuno
said. "We're doing everything
hard in training and practice."
But the team has already start-
ed off the season well.
This past weekend at the Mich-
igan Invitational, senior Denise
Muresan, 2010 Big Ten Player of
the Year, won the singles' title.
"We played well against some
great teams, but there is still
room for improvement," Bern-
stein said.
Last season, the team hit a
peak in rankings at No. 3 and
went into the NCAA Champion-
ships in May ranked No. 4.
It also defeated some of the
top schools in the nation in dual
matches, including wins against
No. 4 Northwestern and No. S
Baylor.
In the coming months, the

Wolverines will compete in
matches against other top-
ranked tennis programs like No.
4 Notre Dame in early Febru-
ary and No. 6 North Carolina in
March. But the highlight match-
up will, once again, be against
the Wildcats in late April.
"There's going tobe some good
teams this season," Critser said
of this season's matchups. "Our
biggest rivalry is Northwestern,
along with Notre Dame."
In order to succeed as much as
they did last year, the Wolverines
must use their team chemistry to
their advantage.
"We push each
other ... We have
no weaknesses
this year."
"Team chemistry is our big-
gest strength," Tatsuno said.
"We push each other, on and off
the court. We have no weakness-
es this year."
When deciding to come to Ann
Arbor this year, Critser said that
she loved the atmosphere around
the tennis program, along with
everything the University had
to offer. And for Critser, adjust-
ing to Michigan has been so easy
because of the team.
The team's ultimate goal for
the season is to make the NCAA
tournament and win Big Ten.
With how it played last year
combined with their determina-
tion to win this year, those goals
appear to be well within reach.
Taking its first step toward'
their goal, Michigan will play
Western Michigan this Sunday

Daily Sports Writer
The Michigan men's tennis
team faces a familiar foe on Sat-
urday though the Wolverines
hope to have better results this
time around. After cruising past
Western Michigan, 7-0, in the first
scoring match of the season last
weekend, the Wolverines will host
No.5 Texas this weekend.
Earlier this month, Michigan
saw the Longhorns in a non-scor-
ilg tournament in Key Biscayne,
Florida. In its final preseason
test, Texas did not surrender a
single match to the Wolverines.
Michigan was swept in singles by
the Longhorns, with their closest
matches endingin tough losses for
sophomores Chris Cha 7-6 (4), 7-6
(4) and Evan King 7-6 (5), 6-4.
Along with six other Wolverine
singles players, King was unable
to win a set against a tough Texas
squad. Senior Jason Jung was the
only player to take a set in singles.
Though it appeared that Texas
trounced the Wolverines, some of
the scores were close.
"In the last match, we had our
chances," King said Tuesday.

"There were a lot ofgreat matches."
After being swept on day one
of the tournament, the Wolver-
ines looked to avenge their singles
defeats against the Longhorns in
doubles on the final day. Michigan
was unable to do so as they were
swept once again. The freshmen
pair of Alex Buzzi and Justin Rossi
and the doubles team of King and
Jung were the only two teams to
keep it close, but both lost their
matches 8-6 in the pro-set.
Despite losing the first time
around to the Longhorns, Michi-
gan - especially the doubles team
of King and Jung - is looking for-
ward to the rematch. King and
Jung are slated to be Michigan's
top tandem in 2011. Their lead-
ership on and off the court will
play a big role in Michigan's suc-
cess, and the chance to knock off
a highly-ranked team like Texas is
an opportunity for the Wolverines
early in the season.
"We're familiar with all the
players, we know what to expect,
we know their tendencies and we
are really looking forward to the
match," King said. "I think we
have a good chance."
But for Michigan to win, it will

need heavy contributions from its
freshman class.
"Even though we didn't do so
well last time we played Texas, we
took some important information
from those matches," freshman
Shaun Bernstein said. "It's up to
us to shake off the early nerves of
playing dual matches as freshmen
and step up and play our game."
Having already played Texas,
Michigan now knows the tenden-
cies and styles of play in each posi-
tion on the Longhorn roster. Even
though the Wolverines cruised
over the Broncos last Saturday, this
weekend's match against a tough
Texas team will notbe as easy.
However, this weekend will
offer Michigan an opportunity to
see some of the best competition
in the country, while also making
a statement early in the season.
"For us, this match is both a
learning experience and a chance
to upset a top team," Michigan
coach Bruce Berque said. "We
really believe we can do it; we are
going into this match to win it.
"We are going to have to win
the closer matches and raise our
level to do it, but we believe we
can do it."

Wohlberg shines in
bounce-back season

Blue defense crumbles .
in early Big Ten action

By MICHAEL FLOREK
Daily SportsEditor
Why has the No. 6 Michigan
hockey team won seven of its past
eight games? Part of the answer lies
in one of the Wolverines' biggest
question marks headed into this
season.
Junior forward David Wohlberg
has eight points in Michigan's past
eight games and is second on the
team with11goals.
But after struggling with a nag-
ging back injury all last season,
health was a concern as October
dawned and the puck dropped
inside Yost Ice Arena. Without a
clear-cut diagnosis on what was
ailing Wohlberg, it was unknown
whether the injury would fester
into this season.
"If you talk to the doctors that
have talked to him and have looked
at the X-rays and so on, they can't
tell you exactly," Michigan coach
Red Berenson said after practice
Tuesday. "A back is like a moving
target. This isn't defined. It's not
'this' and when 'this' gets better,

A hampered Wohlberg mustered
10 goals and 27 points his sopho-
more season, a step backward after
a surprising 15 goal, 30-point fresh-
man campaign.
In his first season with the Wol-
verines, the South Lyon, Mich.
native came in as a gritty forward
who was good with the puck. He
entered the spring as CCHA Rookie
of the Year.
"I thoughtI was justcgoing to try
and play, get in the lineup, help the
team any way I could," Wohlberg
said. "I started off on the fourth
line, just fighting for a spot every
night. Puck luck started happen-
ing - going my way - and I slowly
moved up."
But then the back troubles start-
ed. Though Wohlberg missed just
one game last year, he frequently
sat out of practice early in the week.
Berenson said he "never really got
going." Wohlberg called ita "disap-
pointment." However there were
still some flashes of his goal-scoring
ability.
In Michigan's double-overtime

By BEN ESTES
Daily Sports Writer
in the wake of the Michigan
men's basketball team's subpar
defensive performance on Tues-
day night in its 74-60 loss to North-
western, one may find it difficult to
believe that the same group - just
a week-and-a-half prior - was able
to hold then-No. 3 Kansas to just 51
points in regulation.
But iii recent games, the Wol-
verines' defense has been playing
like a completely different unit
from the one that stifled the high-
powered Jayhawks - and not in a
good way.
Before the conference opener
against Purdue on Dec. 28, Michi-
gan had played stifling man-to-
man defense all season, holding
opponents to 38.1 percent shooting
from the field and just 56.7 points
per game - top-SO in the nation at
the time.
In Big Ten play, the Wolverines
(1-5 Big Ten, 11-8 overall) have
allowed 72.8 points per game,
fourth worst in the conference and
befitting of their 10th-place stand-
ing in the league.
"Our will is there," junior guard
Stu Douglass said after the North-
western loss. "Our eagerness is
there. Maybe we're a little too anx-
ious.
"We're just not staying poised.
One through five, everyone out
there is not playing solid every
single possession. That's basically
going to take the win out from
you."
Part of the problem has been
foul trouble for several Wolverine
starters. Even with its full roster
available, Michigan is thin and
inexperienced as it is.

JAKE FROMM/Daily
Junior David Wohlberg is second on the eam with 11 goals scored this season.

loss to Miami to end the season,
Wohlberg scored one of the Wolver-
ines' two goals, had a couple break-
aways and launched four shots on
net - the most on the team.
That momentum continued into
this campaign. Wohlberg, who
hasn't had any trouble with his
back this season, had five goals in
Michigan's first seven games. But
after a roller coaster career through
two years, the ride didn't stop
in his third season. It hit a down
slope. Wohlberg registered just two
points in the next 10games.
"He got off to such a good start,
and I think he thought everything
was going to keep going that way,"
Berenson said. "Well it doesn't keep
going that way. And sometimes
you're lucky and sometimes you're
good. But I think Wally got into
some, maybe taking it for granted
or just expecting things to go well."
At 6-foot-1, 195 pounds, Wohl-
berg is big, but not overly intimidat-
ing. He's reserved when talking to
the media. But according to Beren-

son, despite his good-natured man-
ner off the ice, it's Wohlberg's grit
that defines him on the ice.
In the past eight games, he's
found the scoring touch again. Last
Saturday against Ferris State, with
Michigan shorthanded, Wohlberg
went after a loose puck at center ice.
He pushed away a Bulldog defense-
man, who arrived at the same time,
away and fed it to senior forward
Scooter Vaughan, who was break-
ing into the zone. Vaughan did the
rest to put the Wolverines up 4-0.
That hustle play came in between
Wohlberg's two goals that night.
His three points in the game tied
his career high.
"Right now you're seeing what
you get," Berenson said. "An hon-
est player, working hard and his
game's starting to come together. I
thought that was his best weekend
of the year."
So why has Michigan won
seven of its past eight games? Look
to plays like Wohlberg's assist for
the answer.

Hail to the Maize and Blue

FLAVOR
From Page 7B

With its large blue awning
and heavily tinted win-
dows, it's hard to tell
immediately that Maize and Blue on
south University Avenue is a deli. The
exterior of the
hulking square i
building somewhat
resembles the
outside of a Gold's,
Gym. Throngs of
frat boys filing into _
the place donning
their Sunday best LILA
- sweatshirts, KALICK
sweatpants and -
Michigan lanyards
- perhaps further this misconception.
However, once you enter, any doubt
dissipates. Maize and Blue captures
the zeitgeist of a true delicatessen.
Perhaps you haven't heard of Maize
and Blue. It, of course, stands in the
4hadows of the most famous institu-
tion of Ann Arbor and the world over:
no, not the Big House - Zingerman's.
Admittedly, my favorite sandwich
in this city is still there, and I never
miss an opportunity to go. But Maize
and Blue offers a great alternative at a
slightly cheaper price, about nine dol-
lars per entree.
Inside, the large glass display case
to your left leaves nothing out. Meats,
cheeses, coleslaws, chicken salad, tuna
salad and cheesecakes sit under plastic
containers stuffed with an assortment
of Lay's chips.
The bottom right corner of the case
contains another tell-tale sign of true
deli-dom - Dr. Brown's Black Cherry
Soda. I could seriously writea mem-
oir about Dr. Brown's. If you haven't
sipped one of these on the beach while
eating a sandwich, it may be safe to say
your best days are ahead of you.
Though it's located only a couple
kdocks from the Diag, Maize and Blue
doesn't just attract students. It's typi-
cal to walk in around lunchtime and

food item presents.
"If you look at an onion or a pep-
per, there's not just one way to cut it,
there's a thousand ways to cut it -
same to cook it," Turchan said. "I've
injected into the menu spots where
the chefs can be creative. Every week
(at North Quad) we have a ten-way
chicken where you just have the
chicken and can create your own
sauce or serving style."
Cummings echoes this sentiment,

see the brown granite tables packed
with youngsters, college kids and
a crew of old-timers, all seemingly
embroiled in serious conversation at a
favorite table toward the back. Patrons
congregating at the front desperately
wait in line to sample the sandwiches
they've been dreaming about since
breakfast.
The restaurant itself is small. Its
tall sood-paneled walls are broken up
by a large mural with "Maize 'N Blue
Deli" tagged in the middle. They're
flanked by the cutouts of a basketball
and football player painted in - what
else - maize and blue. The mural is
covered with the scribbled messages
of the deli's hundreds of fans through
the years.
You'll find no signed picture of Bill
Clinton here as you would in Katz's
Deli in New York. There are no booths
reserved for celebrities as there are at
the Carnegie. All you get in terms of
decor is a smattering of art that seems
better suited for ayard sale - a bald
eagle, a majestic mountain range, an
old hockey photo cut out from the
newspaper.
Michael Phelps
ate here, so you
should, too.
Yet despite the lack of celebrity
headshots hawked openly at well
known delis, Maize and Blue has an
array of famous fans. Michael Phelps
dropped in with a camera crew to let
everyone know how much he loves
Maize and Blue, as did Adam Richman
of "Man v. Food" last September.
A whiteboard menu hangs along
the back wall broadcasting Maize
and Blue's countless combinations by
stressing that it's the little things that
make a meal superb. He cites straw-
berry sauce-topped cheesecake as an
example. Students complained that
the sauce was too lumpy and looked
unappealing, so Cummings worked
with students to modify the topping
so that the cheesecake was brought
to its full potential.
"Everything we do, we try to make
it more appealing for our custom-
ers, whether it's just a fresh sprig of
parsley on a piece of roast turkey or
a lighter strawberry sauce for the
cheesecake," he said.
But for Cummings and Turchan,
creativity is only a part of the job. The

category. Trying them all might takea
lifetime, so it's worth it to ask for rec-
ommendations from the staff - some
of the friendliest, most helpful people
around.
The "Maize 'N Blue Awning" -
probably the joint's most famous sand-
wich - is outstanding. The sandwich
is made of roast beef, smoked turkey,
Colby, Jarlsberg cheese, honey cup
mustard, tomato, onion and green
pepper on grilled sourdough white
bread. Massive, it almost forces you to
dehook your jaw in order to properly
masticate. The honey cup mustard
adds an inexplicable spiciness to the
freshness of the pepper and onion.
The "Where's Bo?" - pastrami,
fried egg, Canadian Cobat cheddar,
mayo, onion and green pepper on
grilled challah - is excellence. Those
who finish it will be champions.
The "Triple Play Reuben" is anoth-
er crowning achievement. The sour-
dough rye bread is perfectly toasted,
bringing together a symposium of
flavors - corned beef, pastrami, Swit-
zerland Swiss, Jarlsbergcheese, sauer-
kraut and Russian dressing. It was so
good and filling that I couldn't eat for
the rest of the day.
There's one major drawback: veg-
etarian options are sparse. There is
one vegetarian sandwich. Somewhat
surprisingly, there is also no egg salad
... weak. But besides these misgivings,
Maize and Blue delivers in te-ms of its
menu. It's got almost every classic deli
delight you desire, plus some specialty
Michigan additions.
You get what you pay for at Maize
and Blue, and that's a massive sand-
wich stuffed with deliciousness and
a smile from the guys behind the deli
counter. It's a happiness that will last
you at least two meals.

two chefs also try to instill a passion
for the culinary arts in the students
they work with and meet in the dining
hall. To date, Cummings has collabo-
rated with four students who dropped
out of the University and transferred
to the Culinary Institute of America.
But at the same time, the chefs also
recognize that not every student
working has gourmet aspirations and
will also reach out to the casual chef.
"I love to teach people," said Tur-
chan. "If you want to learn to cook,
just ask. You're here for your studies,
but you cook once you leave here. You
can't eat at restaurants for the rest of
your life."

home is sometimes reflected in
Project Flavor's menus too.
"I'll say, 'You guys, I made this
awesome black bean thing last
week, I think we should try it at the
cook date' ... We just have constant
teaching-learning experiences,"
Adams said.
Adams started cooking in college
after she took a course on the phi-
losophy and the ethics of food.
"I think that whoever made that
class owes me, because I talk about
it all the time. It basically changed
my life," she said. At the end of the
class, she had to cook a meal for all
the class members, with an ethical
reasoning behind the food that she
prepared.
"Mine was that I wanted to use
all local food for my meal, and from
then on I've gone to the Farmers
Market pretty much every weekend.
I've really changed my lifestyle and
become very interested in cooking,"
Adams said.
In fact, the course was so influen-
tial for Adams that she designed her
own food systems major to accom-
modate her interest.
"Since U of M doesn't have a
nutrition program ... I decided I
wanted to major in something I
was passionate about, so I wrote my

After two acts of diplomatic meet-
ings, banquets and cultural excur-
sions, the six principles take the
stage during the third act of the show
and express their memories, doubts,
regrets and insecurities to the audi-
ence. This final moment takes away
the veil of mystery that separates the
common man from the politician on
television and turns these mythic
figures into relatable human beings.
In addition to its importance in
the operatic world, "Nixon in China"
also has significance on an interna-
tional scale. Since the opera's pre-
miere in 1987, China has grown from
a stubborn Communist nation to a
near capitalist economic superpow-
er; if anything, the opera has become
even more relevant as a topic for
artistic analysis.
"Nixon in China" captures the
moment at which the U.S. re-estab-
lished relations with the PRC. In
1971, a year before Nixon's trip,
America lifted its trade embargo on
China, hoping to facilitate friend-
ship between the two nations. Now
that the United States's economic

own," she said.
Project Flavor also tries to use
as much local produce as possible.
Until October or November, Adams
goes to the Farmers Market on
Wednesdays specifically to get the
ingredients the group needs for its
cook date that week.
"I think that it's silly for us to be
purchasing something like spinach
that's from Meijer and has been
shipped halfway around the world
when we have really great quality
spinach in Ann Arbor," she said.
"I like and appreciate good food,
healthy foods; I feel like stuff you
get a lot of times in restaurants is
such low quality ... You don't feel
good afterward," Isaacoff added.
"But when I make stuff, it's fresh
and it's a lot of whole ingredients."
According to Levine, apart from
how good it tastes, there are other
reasons why she savors the Project
Flavor experience.
"It kind of makes you feel good
when you make something that
tastes good," Levine said.
For Project Flavor, it's all in the
name. Masterfully maneuvering
its way through the kitchen at the
Ronald McDonald House to serve
a scintillating meal that delights
residents' taste buds, the group
gives a piquant kick to the vapid and
mundane. But in its simplest form,
Project Flavor isn't just a club about
volunteering - it's a group of stu-
dents who really love to cook.
fate is inexorably tied to that of
China, Adam and Goodman's opera
contains a new level of meaning for
audiences in 2011.
This fact seems to have spurred
recent interest in "Nixon in China."
In 2009, Naxos Records released
a new critically acclaimed Opera
Colorado recording of the work.
Next month, Nonesuch Records will
reissue its 1988 Grammy-winning
recording of the original cast. In
addition, opera-goers far and wide
will be able to witness director Peter
Sellars's celebrated production of
"Nixon in China" when the Metro-
politan opera broadcasts a Feb. 12
performance to cinemas across the
globe.
Opponents of opera often com-
plain that the art form is unrelatable
and outdated. Yet new works like
"Nixon in China" turn the audience's
attention inward toward society
and make a fascinating connection
between art and current events.
Gods and heroes still exist today, yet
they take on the form of politicians
and celebrities. So while opera may
have been transformed over the past
500 years, it still plays on our imagi-
nations by giving flesh, blood and a
musical voice to the figures we see
only on television and in the news.

A decade before Gordon Gekko taught
us that "greed is good" in 1987's "Wall

was already a way of life
for many a coke-addled
disco clubber. Destroyer
chief Dan Bejar taps into str
late-'70s excess seamless-
ly on the title track from "Kaputt"
his new album, Kaputt,
locking in a smoldering
two-chord groove over six minutes of sexy
overproduction. A dreamy throwback to
the late-disco likes of Bryan Ferry or Hall &
Oates, "Kaputt" captures the era perfectly
and with enough. headroom to fit in among
chillwavers 30 years later. This music is hip
- said without the slightest hint of hipster
irony. Williamsburg might actually dance

to this stuff.
Skating along with a silky smooth saxo-
phone, 'lude-addled synths and arpeggiat-
ing horns, Bejar holds the track in place with
carefully manicured guitars that jangle like
The Cranberries on cocaine. Wistful and
whispery throughout, Bejar's vocals main-
tain an arm's length from the surrounding
soul, rounding out powder-inflected notes
like the Thin White Duke at his groovy best.
However corny as it all might seem on paper,
"Kaputt" is a slow-burning boogie with
enough texture, personality and panache
to stay alive long after the late-night buzz
wears off. 'Til then, find that dusty copy of
Saturday Night Fever, grab a zoot suit and

TRAILER REVIEW

What is "Battle: Los Angeles?" The alien
invasion movie's first trailer, which debuted
on iTunes in November, was a mysterious
collection of slickly edited
action set pieces. It fea-
tured jittery camerawork
that evoked memories of e: Los
"Black Hawk Down" and
"The Hurt Locker," fan- AeleS
tastically executed sci-fi Columbia
CGI comparable to "Dis-
trict 9" and the futuris-
tic, mournfully desperate sound of J6hann
Jfhannsson's "The Sun's Gone Dim and
the Sky's Turned Black." There was no dia-
logue, zero exposition and barely seconds of
screen time for the film's two leads, Aaron
Eckhart ("The Dark Knight") and Michelle
Rodriguez ("Avatar"). Was the film going for
something somber and serious? Or would it
be overdramatic and unintentionally funny,

like last year's "Skyline?"
The second trailer gives us a definitive
answer, and it doesn't involve a universally
loathed, zero-star film. TV broadcasts fill us
in on Earth's condition. Eckhart and Rodri-
guez give line deliveries ripped from battle-
field documentaries. And thenwe plungeright
back into the explosive action of the first trail-
er - the intense, frantic urban warfare that
put "Battle" on the map. Skyscrapers burn.
Helicopters crash. Aliens die. Conceptually,
it's nothing new - films ranging from "War
of the Worlds" to "Independence Day" have
tackled the whole alien invasion thing time
and time again. But judging by the trailer, the
cinematography, the serious tone and the lack
of foreseeable sci-fi MacGuffins all put this
film a notch above the rest of the pack. Points
off though, for recycling the same J6hannsson
song at the end of the trailer.

at the same time and it's nice when
people think its tastes good."
For the members of Project Flavor,
food is a common passion and con-
sumes much of their attention, mak-
ing the volunteering aspect of the
group an added bonus.
"Yeah, I actually forget sometimes
that we do this really positive volun-
teer thing," Isaacoff said.
Isaacoff also emphasized his


interest in healthy food. Growing up,
his mother cooked tasty, high qual-
ity food and his family went out to
eat often. When he went to college,
Isaacoff needed a way to learn how
to cook, which is why he joined Proj-
ect Flavor.
"I was accustomed to eating really
well prepared food ... I went off to
college and left my mother behind
and I was like, 'How am I gonna eat
good food?'" Isaacoff said.
According to Adams, the group
constantly learns from each another
in the kitchen. It was Project Fla-
vor that has taught her how to cook
things she had no idea how to cook
before - like bread.
Project Flavor does its best to
cook with as many fresh, healthy
ingredients as possible, and many of
its menus include tortillas or bread
made from scratch.
"We've made our own lasagna
noodles and we've done ravioli in
the past - that's always fun," Levine
said, adding that one of his favorite
dishes was homemade apple dump-
lings that consisted of apples covered
in dough and caramel sauce.

Cafeteria creativity at the'U

Meet the culinary
experts behind the
chicken broccoli bake
By LEAH BURGIN
SeniorArts Editor
When Natalie Emcard swipes into
a campus dining hall, she may not
consider herself a customer. But for
the chefs who toil in hot kitchens
Rehind the scenes, students are cus-
tomers. And each chef uses his or her
creativity and culinary arts training
to satisfy the thousands of patrons
daily who bustle through the serving
lines and salad bars in the Universi-
ty's nine residential chow houses.
But students who may be pictur-
ing dramatic scenes from "Top Chef"
£nd "Iron Chef" will find that Univer-
sity kitchens don't exhibit the same
panache,wittybanter or frantic atmo-
sphere prevalent in such TV shows.
North Quad Chef Frank Turchan -
a Culinary Institute of America grad
who, like many of the chefs employed
at the University, has worked in a

number of high-profile restaurants,
country clubs and hotels - said he
misses the artistry of high-pressure
kitchens similar to those featured on
the small screen.
"If you watch a dinner service at
any of the fine restaurants, it's almost
like a dance," he said. "No one talks,
they call out orders, there's just this
flow. It's amazing how food goes out.
"I could see down the line and it's
like an orchestra," he added, refer-
ring to his time at the dinner theater
Opus One in Detroit. "You can coor-
dinate who's doing what. You got the
saute station and the grill and the
roaster and the broiler and it's all
crazy."
When East Quad Chef Buzz Cum-
mings, a 20-year veteran of Residen-
tial Dining Services, discussed his
decision to work for the University,
he remembered being uncertain if
cooking at a "college cafeteria" would
merit the same creativity as other
jobs in "the business."
His concern was not without foun-
dation. According to Cummings, for
14 years, the policy of University
dining was to mimic a "McDonald's

model."
"If you go to Bursley to eat lasagna,
you should go to East Quad and West
Quad and South Quad and eat lasa-
gna and it should be the exactly the
same," Cummings explained. "Just
like McDonald's. If you go and get a
cheeseburger and fries and a milk-
shake here, you should be able to go
to Japan and get the same thing."
Four years ago, a new director was
hired who, according to Cummings,
had a different philosophy - creat-
ing a niche identity for each dining
hall on campus to increase selections
for the students and options for the
individual chefs. Students can now
see the result of this change - West
Quad boasts a burrito and Mediterra-
nean bar, the Hill Dining Center rolls
sushi and North Quad specializes in
international cuisine.
But University chefs aren't given
complete free creative rein. Dining
Services executive chef Steve Mey-
ers, who has worked at the Universi-
ty since 1986, emphasized that, while
students may have a different dining
experience depending on where they
eat, the University still stresses stan-
dardization for dining hall basics
and favorites, like the chicken broc-
coli bake.
Chefs are also expected to con-
coct meals based on other Univer-
sity guidelines, including vegan and
vegetarian options, nutritional con-
siderations and student allergies.
And, unlike cooks at private restau-
rants, RDS chefs must, as Turchan
described, "feed a small city" - up
to 5,000 students per dining hall -
every day:

Despite all the factors that must
be considered when writing up each
recipe and menu, Meyers believes
that chefs have the creativeblicense
to dabble freely in their chosen craft.
"I think the opportunity was
always there," Meyers said. "From
the day I started here, one of the
discussion points was, 'We want the
food to be more exciting.' Even back
in 1986, we wanted the food to be cre-
ated as nice as possible and presented
as nice as possible."

Cummings and Turchan agree
with this statement, citing examples
like recipe concoction, chef specials,
themed dining weeks, local vegetable
purchasing and special University
occasions as opportunities for them
to stretch their culinary muscles and
take a stab at a new and exciting dish.
Turchan, who has created about
40 new recipes this academic year,
believes that culinary creativity can
be found in the many options a simple

QUICKIE BURGER
800 South State St.
The sweet potato fries at Quickie Burger
are the best you're likely to find. They cost
more than most are willing to pay for a pota-
to product whose purpose is to supplement
the taste of a cheeseburger, but after all, they
aren't just normal potato fries; they're sweet
potato fries. If you're willing to spend $6.50
on a burger, you should splurge and spend
the extra $3.50 on these fries. The only thing
you'll regret is how quickly you ate them all.
SEVA
314 East Liberty St.
While not marketed as "sweet potato" per
se, Seva's yam fries are the vegetarian haven's
most popular menu item, and for good rea-
son. Each delectable morsel bursts with soft,
sugary goodness under its crunchy and salty
exterior. But the real highlight of the appe-
tizer is the dipping sauce that accompanies
it: Made from a combination of mayonnaise
and locally stewed Clancy's Fancy Hot Sauce,
it makes double dipping a must.

SAVA'S
214 South State St.
Sava's has been gradually classing it up
since its leap across the street. But while
many things may have changed, the sweet
potato fries have stayed true to their old
deliciousness. The portion is generous and
the fries are warm and soft. The wide, thin
strands of sweet potato are perfect for dip-
ping, the only flaw beingsome are cut so thin
that they end up more fry batter than sweet
potato.
GRIZZLY PEAK
120 West Washington St.
At Grizzly Peak, the sweet potato fries are
just as they should be: hearty, sweet and per-
fectly crispy. They are less fries than thick-
cut wedges, which provide the full flavor
and texture of the common sweet potato.
The brewery fries the orange starches light-
ly, so as not to detract from their delicate
sweetness. There is enough taste present to
warrant condiments useless. Fans of sweet
potatoes and fried fare need look no further.

Understanding the art of the roll

Roughly 70 to 80 percent of the selection at the People's Food Co-op is organic or spray-free.
Kerrytown's ow locally grow

People's Food Co-op
promotes organic,
sustainable food
By EMILY BOUDREAU
Daily Arts Writer
On a cold and snowy Tuesday
morning, the People's Food Co-op
bustles with activity despite the
drifts pilingup outside. The shoppers,
immune to the pitfalls of Michigan
weather, simply dust off their bicycle
helmets and stomp the snow off their
rugged boots before entering.
Once inside, it's easy to see why
customers would brave tundra-like
conditions to make a weekly pilgrim-
age to this red brick Mecca in the
heart of Kerrytown. Put simply, the
Food Co-op gives off good vibes. It's
as if breathing the air, just looking
at the local apples and organic kale,
even considering washing your hair
with jojoba shampoo will perma-
nently rid your system of toxins and
allow you to contort your body into
the most fantastic yoga positions.
But this sense of balance and
integrity doesn't just spring out of
nowhere. For 40 years, the People's
Food Co-op has been catering to the
needs of the Ann Arbor community at
large - 15 percent of which are Uni-
versity students.
The Co-op was officially started in
1971.
"That was the tail end of Viet-
nam, and (was) kind of a reaction to
the '50s, when everybody thought
science was saving the world and
people thought, why cook when you
can open a box and add water?" said
Kevin Sharp, the Co-op's marketing
and member services manager. "The
'60s and '70s were reacting against

some of that stuff. There was a real
movement back to nature and people
were looking to get away from all that
highly processed stuff."
According to Sharp, there are a
variety of legends surrounding the
Co-op's start-up, but the most impor-
tant part of its story and its success
is that it was a grassroots movement
that percolated up to satisfy the needs
of all of Ann Arbor.
"We're still here because of the
hard work, commitment and dedica-
tion of those who utilize the Co-op's
resources, because of people who
value what we've done," Sharp said.
"There have definitely been ups and
downs; it's come close (to closing) a
few times, but we're not here to make
stockholders wealthy or open stores
around the country."
It's this sense of openness and hon-
esty in the Co-op's approach to busi-
ness that has drawn members of the
community toward it. For example,
David Klingenberger grew up in Ann
Arbor and worked at the Co-op when
he was in high school.
Klingenberger now runs his own
local business, The Brinery, where
he makes natural, fermented foods
like sauerkraut that he describes as
"artisanal, ancient and delicious." But
it was his days spent working at the
Co-op that sparked his passion for
locally crafted foods.
"Ilove the strong connection it has
to the neighborhood and its dedica-
tion to local farmers," Klingenberger
said. "Especially since now, things
that are local and handcrafted are
kind of under siege in this country."
Indeed, Sharp can remember a
time when Kerrytown was even more
of, as he puts it, "an alterna-hippie
heaven." He remembers that years
ago there was a community-owned
bakery and even a spice co-op just

around the corner on Ann Street.
"I think now, people are really see-
ing what it's like when a local business
goes and then a big chain moves in,"
he said. "When I first started working
as produce manager, I used to scoff at
somethinglocal' being from a farm 15
miles away, but now, because of urban
sprawl, among other things, we'd
be delighted to have produce from a
farm 15 miles away."
It's hard to supply local produce,
especially in the winter, but the Co-
op's first duty is always to its custom-
ers. If the customers want bananas
(and there is no chance in Hell, Mich-
igan, that anyone is growing local
bananas, especially in January) then
the Co-op will carry bananas, even if
it means bringing them in from Cali-
fornia.
"We still do have a commitment to
local farmers, and sometimes we do
get criticism for charging two dollars
for garlic, but we've made that com-
mitment," Sharp said.
At the same time, the people at the
Co-op are running a business that
they hope they can sustain for anoth-
er 40-plus years.
"We have to charge enough for rent
and pay our workers, but (as a not-for-
profit organization), the measure of
what's profitable and how we do busi-
ness is different," Sharp said.
Unlike Whole Foods, the Co-op
doesn't try to cater to a higher-end
shopper and instead wants to reach
out to all members of the community,
providing them with the opportu-
nity to incorporate local, organic and
healthy foods into their diet. How-
ever, even if a customer is stockpiling
bananas from California, a solid 70
to 80 percent of the Co-op's food is
organic or at least is no-spray.
"So like with the garlic example, if
the local is too expensive, we'd also buy

cheaper garlic and put both kinds out,
clearly labeled, and let the customer
make their own choice," Sharp said.
The Co-op is particularly custom-
er-oriented because it's owned by the
people who shop there. Anyone can
walk in and become a member.
"Right now, we have around 7,000
members who've invested to main-
tain a place where they know the
food has integrity and that we're not
trying to get rich off their tofu and
sprouts," Sharp said.
What the Co-op is trying to do is to
bring people together to meet a need
in an egalitarian and honest way.
"Co-ops have been around for-
ever," Sharp said. "It's how a lot of
indigenous cultures operate. Even
after the Industrial Revolution, when
corporate interests took advantage of
people in a community, people band-
ed together in response to that ... We
want to promote the Co-op as a model
of doing business and hope others
look at it and say, 'Hey, that works.'"
"When I first started The Brinery, I
knew that the Co-op would be a perfect
place for my product," Klingenberger
said. "It's supportive and welcoming
and more than any other place repre-
sents the local food ... (That's) some-
thing I want to be a real economic force
in Washtenaw County."
The People's Food Co-op isn't the
only force pushing for a return to
local foods in Ann Arbor. Even here
at the University, people are moving
to make the way students live more
sustainable.
"For many years now we've been
trying to bring in more local foods
(to the housing system)," said Kathy
Whiteside, University Housing nutri-
tionist. "We're lucky that we've been
able to formalize it and have it grow
...We can't purchase everythinglocal,
but we have the option when it's

affordable and available in the quan-
tities we need."
It's hard to find local farmers who
can supply the school with the enor-
mous amount of produce required, but
luckily, the more the University wants,
the more the local farmers can expand.
Yet the dining system isn't just lim-
ited to incorporating more sustain-
able produce.
"Sustainable development meets
the needs of the present without com-
promising the needs of future genera-
tions," said Sandra Lowry, director
of the Residential Dining Services.
"And that's what we are trying to do
here. We've got the tray-less initiative
in East Quad right now; composting;
we recycle our cooking oil; we recycle
plastic, aluminum, glass and our nap-
kins are all recyclable."
Of course, the success of these
initiatives depends on the students'
willingness to participate. Students'
requests and input play a large role
in the University's movement to a
more sustainable future. In 2007, a
student contacted Whiteside to ask if
the milk at the school was rBST free.
Whiteside was able to work with the
University's vendor, a local farmer
co-operative, to remove the additive.
It's changes and initiatives like
these in the University's dining sys-
tem that ally with the People's Food
Co-op's mission in responding to
changes in the technology, environ-
mental practices and legislation in
America that surround the way our
food is produced.
"I don't know how we can do any-
thing but continue to nurture the
community, reduce our carbon foot-
prints, support local farmers and pro-
mote sustainability ... It's a complex
web we've woven to feed ourselves,
and these concerns aren't going
away," Sharp said.

Ann Arbor chefs
provide a taste of the
secrets of sushi
By JACOB AXELRAD
DailyArts Writer
Philadelphia roll with smoked
salmon, cream cheese and avocado.
Dragon roll with shrimp tempura
topped with eel. Geisha roll with
tuna, salmon, Tobiko and Ponzu
sauce. These are just a few of the
names found on the menu of Ayaka
Japanese Restaurant on South Uni-
versity Avenue.
Sang Paik, head chef at Ayaka,
carefully cuts and prepares the fish
that will go into these rolls. He works
in silence, with his head bowed at the
neck and an expression of intense
focus painted on his face. His hand
methodically moves the blade as he
chops and peels, chops and peels, all
the while making sure to greet and
bid farewell to every customer. He
makes his work look simple, but in
reality, this couldn't be further from
the case. After all, the work of a sushi
chef takes the utmost precision and
dedication.
Sushi is a traditional form of Japa-
nese food that varies in style and taste
depending on the region. According to
Paik's wife and Ayaka's owner, Kazu-
mi Paik, the popular Osaka style of
sushi is known for its variety in ingre-
dients, while the Tokyo style is known
for its seasonings.

But the basic process of sushi roll-
ing begins with the fish. Sashimi, a
plain fish, and nigiri, a fish with rice,
are the two original kinds of sushi.
Yet according to LSA senior and
Sushi.com waiter Isaac Kim, the most
popular form of sushi in this country
is maki, or rolls. This contrasts with
Japan, where the customary sashimi
and nigiri continue to dominate the
sushi scene.
"(Maki) is more of an American
thing," Kim said. "But by now (in this
country), it's all just sushi."
As a town known for its cultural
diversity, Ann Arbor boasts a vibrant
sushi scene - evidenced by the
numerous sushi bars and restaurants
littering the edge of campus. Though
a lot of things have changed about the
practice of making sushi through its
transplantation from Japan to Amer-
ica, some of its original attributes are
still present today in Ann Arbor -
most notably gender distribution of
sushi chefs.
"In Japan, it's much more tradi-
tional to have men as sushi chefs,"
Kazumi Paik said.
This custom has its roots in the
old Japanese thinking that men, by
nature, have a lower body tempera-
ture than women, making their hands
cooler. Thus, when men touch the fish,
they're transporting the least amount
of heat.
"When you make sashimi or nigiri,
you're supposed to touch it the least
amount of times as possible," Kim
said. "That's also why the portions are
so small. As opposed to serving sushi

in large quantities, you're supposed to
eat it in small portions so you can eat it
quickly before it gets warm."
The process of making sushi dif-
fers from restaurant to restaurant, but
there are a few common trends.
"First we make the sticky rice," said
Haeri Lee, manager of Totoro on State
Street. "Then we marinate and mix it
in with a special vinegar sauce. Once
this is done, we roll it in sea'eed,
and finally you can add whatever you
want, like salmon or tuna."
The important part comes with the
preparation - sushi can either be of
excellent or poor quality depending
on the way it's treated and cut, espe-
cially when it comes to the raw fish
itself.
"The way you can tell the quality
of a sushi chef is by how he cuts the
fish, and by the color," Kim said. "A lot
of our chefs make the rolls, but only a
couple are allowed to make the nigiri
and sashimi."
Sushi is seasonal and thus depends
upon external factors for quality and
quantity. Whether a restaurant has a
certain fish in stock is largely reliant
on the popularity of a certain item and
its availability.
"What a lot of people don't know
about sushi restaurant culture is that
just because an item is on the menu
doesn't mean it's really there. There
are different seasons for different
fish," Kim said. "Certain fish are what
one might call an acquired taste,
like sea urchin, and these are really
expensive. So we might not order a lot
of that type."

Sushi has taken on a life of its own
since its spike in popularity in the
United States. These innovations can
be found here in Ann Arbor, both in
the style and in the ingredients that
go into the recipes.
"American sushi is so different, in
a good way," Kazumi Paik said. "In
Japan, we would never think to use
cream cheese or avocado or to deep
fry our sushi. These are all American
influences."
The creative aspect is something
that's also distinctly American. New
York rolls that tower with seasonal
decorations and caterpillar rolls using
avocados as the body and soy sauce
as the eyes and mouth are just two
examples of items that can only be
found on the menus of American sushi
restaurants.
According to Kazumi Paik, the sin-
gularity of American sushi has even
begun to influence what's occurring
back in Japan.
"My family came here from Japan,
and they were so impressed with
this kind of American sushi that they
asked me to come back to Japan to
start an American-style sushi restau-
rant," she said.
But the artistry goes deeper than
cultural influences. It begins in the
kitchens themselves. Chefs are the
ones responsible for developing new
rolls, both in taste and in aesthetic
design.
At Totoro, when chefs come up
with a new roll, they begin by tast-
ing the ingredients themselves. Then
comes the design. They've been

known to incorporate anything from
spicy sauces to apples and carrots
for decoration. Finally, the new cr
ations are brought to customers to see
whether a warm reception is in order.
If not, it's back to the drawing board.
"We always eat food with our
mouths, but first we see it," Lee said.
"So if it looks terrible, people are more
hesitant to eat it. This is why we tryto
make it as attractive as possible."
As a college town, Ann Arbor has
shown itself to be more than hospi-
table to sushi culture. The diverse
student population and University
community have allowed for numer-
ous restaurants to sprout up right
along the edge of campus.
"Around here, it's mainly students
and families, so we try to accom-
modate for them," Kim said. "On
Wednesdays, it's 20-percent off fee.
everyone (at Sushi.com)."
This symbiotic relationship works
out well for the restaurants and the
students alike.
Beyond the cultural and tradi-
tional aspects that comprise the sushi
scene in the country and Ann Arbor,
good sushi rolling aims to prepare
and present the best food possible.
In a brief break from his work, Sang
Paik noted his personal favorite roll -
Ayaka's rainbow roll #2.
"It's so good. It melts in your
mouth," he said.
The joy Paik takes in his craft par-
allels the level of customer satisfac-
tion found in the sushi restaurants
in Ann Arbor - in this town, people
simply love sushi.

Most sushi chefs are men, following from a traditional Japanese view that men have lower body temperatures, which keeps the sushi cool.
