City Council voted down a 

resolution Monday that would 
have directed the city attorney 
to investigate the actions of 
the protesters who sought to 
disrupt Ann Arbor’s annual 
deer cull. The measure, which 
was defeated in a 6-5 vote, 
would have required the city 
attorney to “take any and 
all 
appropriate 
responsive 

actions, 
including 
issuance 

of citations and the filing of 
lawsuits seeking an injunction 
or such other relief that the 
city 
attorney 
determines 

appropriate.”

Ann Arbor established its 

deer management program in 

late August of 2015 in response 
to resident complaints about 
overgrazing 
and 
worries 

about deer-vehicle collisions. 
Since then, municipal deer 
management 
efforts 
have 

racked up costs to the city 
of more than half a million 
dollars, 
with 
City 
Council 

approving more than $182,000 
in 
continued 
spending 
in 

November. 
According 
to 

the city, a total of 274 have 
been killed and 72 surgically 
sterilized. 

Councilmember 
Jane 

Lumm, I-Ward 2, said there 
was an urgent need for the city 
to intervene.

“I’m bringing forward this

Researchers 
at 
the 

University of Michigan are 
leading a national collaborative 
effort to study firearm injury 
and death among children and 
teens. The interdisciplinary 
project, comprised of more 
than 30 researchers, health 
practitioners, 
and 
firearm 

owners and a dozen academic 
institutions, seeks a scientific 
approach 
to 
gun 
violence 

prevention with respect to gun 
ownership rights.

The 
project, 
known 

as 
the 
Firearm 
Safety 

Among Children and Teens 
Consortium (FACTS) is led 
by professor of emergency 
medicine and director of the 
Injury 
Prevention 
Center 

Rebecca 
Cunningham, 

professor of public health Marc 
Zimmerman, 
and 
assistant 

professor 
of 
emergency 

medicine 
Patrick 
Carter. 

In November 2018, FACTS 
launched a new website with 
data, research, videos, courses, 
fact sheets and other resources 
on firearm injury prevention, 
less than a week after the 
National 
Rifle 
Association 

prompted 
controversy 
by 

tweeting that doctors should 
“stay in their lane.”

In response to those who 

argue academics and doctors 
should 
not 
be 
involved, 

Cunningham 
believes 
gun 

violence is a public health 

problem, 
one 
that 
should 

be 
addressed 
with 
injury 

prevention 
science 
and 

increased funding for research. 

“The amount of money we 

have 
for 
firearm 
research 

still pales in comparison to 
the amount of funding for 
cancer, which actually kills 
less children,” Cunningham 
said. “Firearms are the second-
leading cause of death among 
children and adolescents in the 
United States. In the same way 
that having less car crashes 
is not political, or less opioid 
overdoses 
is 
not 
political, 

having less firearm injuries and 
deaths is not political.”

The 
five-year 
project 
is 

funded by a $4.9 million grant 
from 
the 
Eunice 
Kennedy 

Shriver 
National 
Institute 

of Child Health and Human 
Development 
(NICHD), 
the 

largest NIH grant for firearm 
research in 20 years. It has 
a number of goals, such as 
developing a research agenda 
through identifying research 
questions 
and 
priorities, 

conducting pilot studies to 
establish groundwork and best 
practices and creating an online 
data repository of existing 
research. 
These 
initiatives, 

according to Cunningham, aim 
to develop resources in a field 

that has been largely neglected 
in the past.

“Firearm prevention is in its 

infancy. It’s been very much 
suppressed,” Cunningham said. 
“FACTS is set up to jumpstart 
research on firearm violence 
that has been mostly absent 
for the past couple of decades. 
At the end of five years, we will 
have helped to create a field 
that is much more active and 
a group of researchers that are 
much more knowledgeable.”

Ann Arbor City Council passed a 

resolution Monday night directing 
the city attorney to settle a lawsuit 
with a citizens group over the 
sale of a plot of land adjacent to 
the Ann Arbor District Library. 
Local attorney Tom Wieder filed a 
complaint in Augustin Washtenaw 
County Circuit Court on behalf of 
the Ann Arbor Central Park Ballot 
Committee in response to the sale 
of the lot to Chicago developer Core 
Spaces.

Proposal A passed by a narrow 

margin in November after months 
of debate and opposition from 
Mayor 
Christopher 
Taylor. 
It 

amends the city charter, nullifying 
a vote by City Council in April 2017 
to sell the lot to Core Spaces, which 
had planned to build a 17-story high 
rise with office and retail space, a 
hotel, apartments and an outdoor 
plaza.

Following

Organization calls for reversal of decision ordering cross-examination in misconduct cases

Tuesday afternoon, Jane Roe, 
a newly-formed student group 
at the University of Michigan, 
penned a petition calling for 
the University to adjust its new 
policy in Title IX investigations, 

based on the September Title 
IX ruling by the Sixth Circuit 
Court of Appeals. The ruling 
states students accused of sexu-
al misconduct must be allowed 
the right to cross-examine their 
accuser as a part of due process. 
LSA freshman Emma Sandberg, 
a founding member of the orga-

nization, said adhering to this 
ruling would cause further trau-
ma to survivors and discourage 
students from coming forward 
to report sexual assault.
“The harm that would be 
caused by this policy would be 
devastating,” 
Sandberg 
said. 

“Having to sit face to face with 

the person who raped you and 
be forced to speak, interact, and 
be drilled with questions by 
the person who violated you...I 
consider that to be abusive. A 
process this cruel will have life-
long, emotional consequences

diverse community and they 
need to be very understanding 
… we want somebody who 
is compassionate as well as 
authoritative.”

On Jan. 14, City Council 

will 
hold 
a 
work 
session 

outlining the goals for this hire. 
Hayner said the current police 
climate has taken a toll on the 

department and their hiring 
prospects.

“We are having a heck of 

a time trying to fill our ranks 
because no one wants to be a 
police officer right now,” Hayner 
said. “I highly recommend that 
we are doing ride alongs to see 
(the community) through the 
law enforcement officer’s eyes.”

Hayner 
discussed 
the 

necessity of the new chief being 
able to train others.

“What any department needs 

is a real strong leader who is 
going to set the tone for the 
department and someone who 
is going to do the training to 
avoid the situations we see on 
the news,” Hayner said. “I think 
it’s really important that we 
find someone who sets a tone of 
tolerance in the department.”

During the meeting, Thomas 

highlighted the community’s 
strong emphasis on the future.

“The point that I would 

emphasize is that there are 

issues and circumstances 
that has led to the model 
that is being used today,” 
Thomas 
said. 
“What 

I’m 
hearing 
from 
the 

community is that there 
is a willingness to move 
past that. I have not heard 
anybody say that they’re 
so stuck in the past that 
they’re not willing to 
move into the next stage.”

When asked about the 

challenges facing the next 
chief, Thomas emphasized 
the 
department’s 

challenges with workforce 
turnover and diversity. 
However, 
he 
said 
he 

would not favor a minority 
candidate.

“Clearly there’s been 

questions about staffing 
and turnover,” Thomas 
said. “Diversity of the 
workforce 
is 
another 

challenge, but these issues 
aren’t 
unique 
to 
Ann 

Arbor. The goal is not 
necessarily the race. The 
goal is the philosophy.”

Hayner said he was 

looking for someone who 

would be progressive in leading 
the police department.

“It’s a look at someone who 

is versed not only in ridged 
academy training but in new 
styles of policing, community 
policing 
and 
restorative 

justice and diversion practices 
... 
finding 
a 
balance 
and 

embracing and testing out new 
ideas,” Hayner said. “There is 
a perception problem and (we 
need) someone who is going to 
be intolerant of poor behavior 
in the department.”

Throughout 
the 
hearing, 

residents discussed concerns 
regarding 
the 
financial 

inequalities in Ann Arbor based 
on factors such as education 
and social privilege, with some 
saying they knew of people who 
had left the community because 
of a high cost of living and the 
lack of middle- and low-income 
housing. They said they wanted 
the incoming police chief to 
understand the concerns and 
politics of the community.

LSA freshman Audrey Ling 

said she was satisfied with 
the current work of the police 
department and hopes the new 
police chief can help continue 
this good work.

“It seems like the crime in 

the area is not as severe, so it 
seems like they’re doing a good 
job,” Ling said.

In talking about what she 

would want from a police 
chief, Ling discussed the large 
responsibility that falls on the 
police chief.

ON THE DAILY: UNIVERSITY ALUM DARREN CRISS WINS GOLDEN GLOBE 

THIS WEEK IN HISTORY: CLINTON SEXUAL HARASSMENT CASE TO PROCEED

On the Daily: University 

alum Darren Criss becomes 
first Filipino-American to 
win Golden Globe

SMTD graduate and actor 

Darren Criss became the 
first Filipino-American to 
win a Golden Globe award 
at the 2019 Golden Globe 
Awards in Beverly Hills 
Sunday.

Criss received the award 

for best actor in a limited 
series or TV movie for The 
Assassination 
of 
Gianni 

Versace, where he portrayed 
Andrew Cunanan, the serial 
killer who murdered Gianni 
Versace and four others.

Criss has always been 

proud 
of 
his 
Filipino 

heritage, and credited the 
award to his mother who 
grew up in Cebu, Philippines.

“This has been a marvelous 

year for representation in 
Hollywood, and I am so 
enormously proud to be a 
teeny tiny part of that as the 

son of a firecracker Filipino 
woman 
from 
Cebu 
that 

dreamed of coming into this 
country and getting to be 
invited to cool parties like 
this,” Criss said. “Mom, I 
know you’re watching this.”

Criss also played Blaine 

Anderson in Glee. He also 
performed at the inaugural 
balls of the 57th Presidential 
Inauguration and released 
an independently-produced 
EP in 2010.

January 10, 1996
WASHINGTON (AP) - An 

Arkansas sexual harassment 
case 
against 
President 

Clinton can go to trial, a 
federal appeals court ruled 
yesterday, setting the stage 
for a Supreme Court battle. 
Clinton’s 
attorney 
argued 

that Clinton should not be 
questioned under oath on 
such matters while serving 
as President. But an appeals 
panel in St. Louis decided on a 
2-1 vote that the case brought 
by a former Arkansas state 
employee, Paula Jones, can 

proceed.

“The President, like all 

other government officials, is 
subject to the same laws that 
apply to all other members of 
our society.” The court ruled. 
“A sitting President is not 
immune from civil suits for 
his unofficial acts.”

“Obviously, we’re a little 

disappointed, but there was 
a 
very 
strong 
dissenting 

opinion...which 
we 
believe 

the 
Supreme 
Court 
will 

follow, assuming it takes the 
case,” said Robert Bennett, 
Clinton’s attorney.

If the top court did agree to 

take the case, there’s virtually 
no chance a trial would start 
before the 1996 election. The 
Supreme Court would not 
hear arguments until October 
at the earliest, and a decision 
would not be expected until 
sometime next year.

Jones, a former Arkansas 

employee, alleges that Clinton 
sexually harassed her during 
an encounter in a Little Rock 
hotel suite in 1991. She has 
said she rejected Clinton’s 
suggestion that they engage 
in sex. Clinton has denied 

ever having an encounter 
with Jones, and has said he 
cannot recall whether he ever 
met her. Bennett has tried 
to have the case dismissed 
on grounds of presidential 
immunity.

In a statement, Gilbert 

Davis, one of Jones’ attorneys, 
said 
his 
client 
was”very 

pleased” 
with 
yesterday’s 

ruling. 

“This 
goes 
beyond 
the 

parties in the case because 
it stands on the proposition 
that no one is above the law,” 
Davis said. 

He said the next step - 

barring any further legal 
delays - would be taking sworn 
statements 
from 
Clinton 

and a former Arkansas state 
trooper that Jones has alleged 
first told her that Clinton was 
interested in meeting her in 
the private hotel suite.

Bennett 
argued 
in 

September that letting Jones’ 
case proceed would set the 
precedent of exposing sitting 
Presidents 
to 
lawsuits 
by 

anyone who disagrees with 
their policies. In addition, 
Bennett has contended that 

the lawsuit would unfairly 
distract Clinton from the 
performance of his official 
duties - an argument often 
employed 
by 
government 

officials to avoid testifying in 
civil proceedings. But Davis, 
Jones’ attorney, has asserted 
that his client is due the same 
rights to a fair and speedy 
trial as anyone else - whoever 
the defendant is.

Bennett has two weeks to 

appeal the three-judge panel’s 
decision by asking the full 8th 
Circuit court to consider the 
matter.

as safe storage of guns 
and how to work with 
families with high-risk 
teenagers, 
without 
taking 

away guns. In addition, given 
that 2018 was the worst year 
for gun violence in schools 
on 
record, 
Cunningham 

expressed the need for further 
inquiry into whether existing 
safety measures in schools are 
effective.

For Cunningham, working 

as a doctor in the emergency 
department 
only 
further 

highlights the need to focus on 
firearm injury prevention. 

“One of the things that’s 

specific about taking care of 
patients who have been injured 
by a gun is the lethality of the 
bullet is such that there’s not 
as much you can do after the 
event,” Cunningham said. “We 
take care of people who have 
had horrific injuries, but I want 
to do work so we not have them 
in the ER in the first place.”

To include non-academics 

in the project, FACTS created 
a 
practitioner 
advisory 

board 
composed 
of 
health 

practitioners, gun owners and 
stakeholders, 
pastors, 
and 

others involved in the gun 
violence prevention effort. 

Tom O’Connor, who also 

serves on the board of directors 
for Gun Owners for Responsible 
Ownership, is a member of the 
advisory 
board. 
O’Connor 

highlighted 
the 
importance 

of the firearm injury field, 
emphasizing that gun owners 
should be engaged in the 

conversation. 

“With 
rights 
come 

responsibilities… My personal 
belief is that if gun owners 
don’t step forward and support 
solid research and common 
sense solutions to reducing 
gun violence, you get policy 
responses 
that 
don’t 
work 

and might not make sense,” 
O’Connor said.

FACTS also hopes to create 

an active field that will outlast 
the five year duration of the 
project, prioritizing the need 
to train future firearm injury 
researchers. School of Public 
Health PhD candidate Amanda 
Mauri is involved in the FACTS 
policy taskforce. She explained 
being with the project has given 
her a network of individuals and 
experts with similar interests. 

“What FACTS has really 

provided me is this great space 
to interact with the existing 
renowned researchers within 
the firearm space,” Mauri said. 
“I can also connect with other 
trainees who are interested 
in firearm-related work both 
within and outside of Michigan, 
from the Masters through the 
Post-Doctoral level.”

Mauri 
also 
noted 
the 

University is well-positioned to 
lead this growing field due to its 
existing infrastructure.

“We have some of the most 

established firearm researchers 
in the U.S. The Injury Center 
is one of the most established 
ones in the country,” Mauri 
said. “This is a historic moment 
for firearm research in that we 
can finally start adding to the 
evidence base.”

that have been brought to our 
attention regarding protesters 
who have been interfering,” 
Lumm 
said. 
“They 
haven’t 

been peacefully demonstrating, 
they 
have 
actually 
stopped 

and prohibited our contractor 
White Buffalo from performing 
their culling contracted work 
on properties that have been 
identified for culling.”

The city hired Connecticut-

based White Buffalo Inc. to 
execute its deer management 
program in 2016. Since this 
year’s cull began at the start 
of the month, the company’s 
sharpshooters 
have 
taken 

up positions on public and 
private land around Ann Arbor, 
including land owned by the 
University of Michigan, and will 
remained stationed there until 
Jan. 27.

Protesters from groups like 

Friends of Ann Arbor Wildlife 
in Nature and Ann Arbor Non-
Lethal Deer Management have 
held 
demonstrations 
by 
the 

sharpshooters’ perches.

Lumm said the protesters 

have worked to disrupt the cull 
and make the city-hired hunters 
less effective.

“The protesters are preventing 

them again from conducting this 
work effectively,” Lumm said. 
“The taxpayers are on the hook 
paying for this contract and the 
result has been that they will not 
perform the work that they have 
been contracted to perform.”

Lisa Abrams of FAAWN said 

the group’s protests were lawful, 
and thanked the councilmembers 
who 
voted 
against 
Lumm’s 

resolution.

“The fact is that our protests 

have been peaceful,” Abrams 
said. “We have been on the 
sidewalk every single time, or 
we have gotten the permission 
of private residents to be on their 
private property, so every single 
time we have been peaceful 
and we are expressing our First 
Amendment right to free speech, 
and thank you for protecting that 
so we are not living in a gestapo 
state.”

Mayor Christopher Taylor has 

repeatedly opposed the deer cull 
and was the lone vote against it 
when the program was adopted 
in 2015, but he said his opposition 
was not the reason why he did 
not support Lumm’s resolution.

“Civil disobedience involves 

disobedience 
and 
occasional 

violation of the law,” Taylor said. 
“We have protests in the streets 
without permits on occasion and 
I don’t want to get into a situation 
where nonviolent protest results 

in legal action.”

In an email interview, Bernie 

Banet of Washtenaw Citizens 
for Ecological Balance, a group 
that supports the city’s deer 
management efforts, said the 
protesters purposefully tried to 
impede the success of the cull.

“The small band of ‘protesters’ 

seeking to protect deer have been 
very 
successfully 
interfering 

with this year’s culls, from 
what I hear,” Banet wrote. “By 
congregating at the cull sites 
and, 
they 
claim, 
exercising 

their free speech rights they are 
successfully scaring away the 
deer. That is, in my opinion, their 
transparent intention, not simply 
to protest. This effect on the 
planned culls can be construed 
as illegal interference with a 
lawful 
animal 
management 

program.”

Banet criticized City Council 

for failing to pass the resolution.

“This does not bode well for the 

City going forward being able to 
protect its residents and its parks 
and neighborhoods from the 
impact of deer overabundance: 
collisions with deer on the roads, 
tick-borne illnesses facilitated 
by a dense deer population, 
interference 
with 
forest 

regeneration, and destruction of 
plantings throughout the city,” 
he wrote. “A better balance 
between the right to protest and 

a government’s right to protect 
its citizens from an animal 
menace must be found.”

Councilmember Jeff Hayner, 

D-Ward 1, voted against the 
measure. He said he did not want 
to discuss his personal beliefs 
regarding the cull but defended 
the protesters.

“I really believe that the 

opposition 
to 
this 
cull 
is 

legitimate,” he said. “… They feel 
that it’s not the right thing to 
be doing to send guns into our 
parks, that it’s not necessary, 
that we should live and let 
live. I think that these are very 
valid arguments, and the idea 
of banging pots and pans and 
shining lights and yelling and 
exhibiting other forms of civil 
disobedience, well, it’s been 
famously said that the riot is the 
language of the unheard, and I 
believe that these people do feel 
unheard.”

Councilmember Ali Ramlawi, 

D-Ward 5, said one of his primary 
obligations as an elected official 
was to make sure residents’ tax 
dollars were not being wasted — 
a responsibility that included the 
money spent on the cull.

“I’m all for civil disobedience, 

but I know it comes at a cost,” 
Ramlawi said. “You break the 
law, you break the law and you 
suffer the consequences of doing 
so.”

agreement in late December.

Will Hathaway, a member of 

the Ann Arbor Central Park Ballot 
Committee, commended the city 
for moving to settle the citizens 
group’s lawsuit.

“This 
action 
will 
help 

disentangle 
(the 
city) 
from 

the idea of selling Library Lot 
development rights to a private 
corporation,” Hathaway said. “It 
is time to look forward to the idea 
of an urban park and civic center 
on the library block. Creating a 
consensus vision will take some 
work and time. All of us want a 
resulting public space of which we 
will be proud.”

City 
Councilmember 
Jane 

Lumm, I-Ward 2, said she was 
glad the resolution to wind down 
the lawsuit was on the agenda.

“Whenever there is litigation 

against the city, especially when 
it strains from our citizens, 
our hope is that the litigation is 
ultimately settled in an amicable 
agreement,” 
Lumm 
said. 

“The passage of Proposal A in 
November is a clear statement 
from residents that the sale of the 
Library Lot development rights 
to Core Spaces is not what the 
majority of residents wanted for 
the property.”

City Administrator Howard 

Lazarus informed the developers 
that the city was abandoning the 
deal in a letter on Dec. 31.

“The 
charter 
amendment 

prevents or impairs the city 
from carrying out the sale of the 
development rights on the Library 
Lot,” Lazarus wrote. “Because 
this situation is obviously one that 
cannot be cured, the agreement 
with Core Spaces is terminated. 
We will arrange for the return 
of the deposit paid as part of 
this transaction and await your 
direction on where and how to 
send it.”

The 
letter 
directed 
Core 

Spaces to send any further 
correspondence to him and City 
Attorney Stephen Postema. In a 
statement issued Jan. 2, Andrew 
Wiedner, chief acquisitions officer 
of Core Spaces, criticized Ann 
Arbor’s decision to dismantle the 
agreement.

“We strongly disagree with 

the city’s position as stated in 
the letter,” Wiedner said. “We 
are evaluating our options and 
will be responding in more detail 
shortly.”

At a City Council meeting 

Dec. 17, Core Spaces attorney I.W. 
Winston cautioned the city to 
take steps to avoid provoking legal 
action.

“I do think that there is an 

opportunity to have discussions 
and I would hope to have those 
in a different form in the future 
to see whether the issues that 
separate us can be resolved 

without high stakes and very 
expensive litigation,” Winston 
said.

Had the Core Spaces deal 

gone through, $5 million of 
the proceeds would have been 
allocated to the city’s affordable 
housing trust fund. Monday night 
at City Hall, Ann Arbor resident 
Robert Gordon pointed out that 
the collapse of the sale meant the 
city lost money that would have 
benefitted people struggling to 
afford the city’s high cost of living.

“We 
have 
a 
significant 

challenge ahead of us,” Gordon 
said. “It’s one thing to have good 
faith disagreements about the use 
of property in downtown Ann 
Arbor. It’s quite another to ignore 
the needs of the lower income 
people of Ann Arbor. Let’s look 
out for them. That’s a big part of 
your job.”

Aside from legal costs, the city 

is still facing nearly $250,000 
in fees for its failed deal with 
Core Spaces. Tom Crawford, the 
city’s chief financial officer, told 
MLive Ann Arbor would have to 
pay about $220,000 in fees to a 
real estate broker that helped the 
city solicit different development 
proposals for the site in 2015.

The Library Lot has been 

the subject of another legal 
challenge prior to the Ann Arbor 
Central Park Ballot Committee’s 
complaint.

In 
June, 
former 

Councilmember 
Sumi 

Kailasapathy, D-Ward 1, and 
Councilmember Anne Bannister, 
D-Ward 1, sued the city, Taylor 
and 
City 
Clerk 
Jacqueline 

Beaudry for a breach of protocol 
in the process of selling the 
Library Lot. The lawsuit alleged 
that when Taylor and Beaudry 
signed the contract with Core 
Spaces, the document finalizing 
the sale was not presented to City 
Council. That was supposedly in 
violation of the city charter, which 
requires that a minimum of eight 
councilmembers approve sales 
worth more than $25,000.

During a hearing in early 

September, Judge David Swartz 
of the Washtenaw County Circuit 
Court heard arguments in the 
case and said he would issue a 
written opinion, but has not done 
so yet.

Lumm said she hoped the city 

would find a way to settle all the 
legal issues pertaining to the 
Library Lot quickly, noting that 
the Ballot Committee’s lawsuit 
was more or less a moot point 
after Proposal A’s passage.

“The purpose of the litigation 

obviously was to stop that sale, 
and that now being done, an 
agreement 
and 
court 
order 

confirming that the sale to 
Core will not take place is the 
simple, natural way to close the 
book on the issue,” Lumm said. 
“Hopefully we will also be able to 
close the book on the other related 
litigation soon.”

of victims of sexual assault.”
Rick Fitzgerald, assistant vice 
president for Public Affairs said 
that the University decided to 
implement the interim policy 
and will be gathering feedback 
on the effectiveness of the pol-
icy.
“We understand that this new 
element in our policy can be up-
setting to those involved in the 
process,” Fitzgerald said. “We 
believe questioning by students 
is less traumatic than question-
ing by attorneys and also re-
moves concerns that a student 
may not be able to hire an attor-
ney. Also, our process remains 
an administrative procedure, 
not a court hearing.”
The ruling was made in re-
sponse to a lawsuit filed by a 
former University student who 
claimed the University does 
not provide due process for 
male students accused of sexual 
misconduct, which the lawsuit 
attributed to gender discrimi-
nation. The lawsuit alleges on 
March 12, a female student 
reported to the Office of Insti-
tutional Equity that she and a 
male student had engaged in 
non-consensual sex about four 
months prior. 

As the lawsuit reads, the male 
student alleged he and the fe-
male student had continued to 
talk with each other after the 
incident via Snapchat and occa-
sionally ate together within the 
campus’ dining halls. He also 
claims the female student had 
sent a text message suggesting 
the two should have sexual in-
tercourse once more. The stu-
dent said he declined this offer, 
telling her the nature of their 
relationship was one of a casual 
friendship.
The female student filed anoth-
er complaint pertaining to an 
infraction regarding a no-con-
tact order established in April. 
She claimed she saw him at a 
University dining hall where he 
remained after the alleged en-
counter. However, the male stu-
dent provided Mcard documen-
tation proving he was not at the 
dining hall at the said time.
The lawsuit also cited that 
because of these allegations, 
the 
University 
forcibly 
re-

voked the student’s access to 
his transcripts, impeding his 
enrollment in a graduate engi-
neering program. The lawsuit 
challenged the University’s in-
vestigative procedure and the 
initial withholding of the stu-
dent’s transcripts.
The University released the 

male student’s transcripts in 
mid-June, about a week after 
the lawsuit was filed, yet the 
battle regarding due process 
remained until about a month 
later.
The decision, mirroring a pre-
vious 2017 case at the Univer-
sity of Cincinnati in which the 
court ruled an accused student 
must receive some type of hear-
ing in cases formed by word 
of mouth where credibility is 
in question, evoked an appeal 
from the University itself citing 
similar grievances found in the 
Roe petition. However, Sand-
berg claims the University has 
taken the ruling a “step further” 
even after their appeal.
“The Sixth Circuit ruled that 
the University must require 
cross-examination by the ac-
cused or his agent,” Sandberg 
said. “So, the key is that they 
said ‘or his agent’ which would 
be a personal adviser or a law-
yer, which is how it is done 
within criminal and civil cases. 
Currently, at other schools it is 
done by a lawyer. To have it be 
done by the accused rapist is 
unbelievable, I don’t know why 
(the University) felt that it was 
a better way to go about cross-
examination by the accused 
rapist themself.”
As a student going through the 

Title IX investigation process, 
Sandberg said the act of simply 
reporting is exhausting.
“I am currently in a Title IX 
case in another school,” Sand-
berg said. “My case currently 
doesn’t require cross-exami-
nation. But, it is already very 
stressful — it is so much to deal 
with. A lot of people don’t real-
ize how difficult these Title IX 
cases are, they just think about 
the accused. For the person 
who is the complainant, it is an 
exhausting process.”
LSA sophomore Rebecca Har-
ley, a volunteer at Women at 
Risk International, a nonprofit 
providing support for women 
and children of abuse, believes 
this ruling will create further, 
unnecessary mental trauma in 
already difficult and lengthy 
situations as described by Sand-
berg.
“This new ruling could create 
further trauma for survivors 
of sexual assault,” Harley said. 
“Being in the presence of your 
attacker could resurface the 
trauma of the incident. This is 
an unnecessary risk that falls 
solely on a person who has al-
ready undergone severe mental 
and physical suffering.”

City 
Council 
moved 
to 

amend an ordinance limiting 
the unauthorized use of Ann 
Arbor’s official seal at a meeting 
Monday after the American 
Civil Liberties Union called 
restrictions requiring mayoral 
permission unconstitutional.

Mayor Christopher Taylor 

said the city attorney’s office 
worked to craft an ordinance 
to respond adequately to the 
ACLU’s concerns.

“This 
is 
an 
ordinance 

that 
complies 
with 
those 

objections,” Taylor said. “It’s 
our goal, of course, to avoid 
confusion in the suggestion 
of affiliation or sponsorship, 
but it is also our goal to make 
sure we comply with the First 
Amendment in all obligations, 
so I’m glad that this is moving 
forward and I think this is an 
effective change.”

In 
July, 
City 
Council 

passed a resolution banning 
unauthorized displays of the 
seal, with violations incurring 
possible fines of up to $10,000.

In November, Dan Korobkin, 

deputy legal director for ACLU 
of Michigan, and Gayle Rosen, 
co-chair of the Washtenaw 
County 
ACLU 
Lawyers 

Committee, sent a letter to the 

city criticizing the measure, 
saying it violated constitutional 
protections for freedom of 
speech and calling for Ann 
Arbor to repeal it immediately.

“The City Seal and Flag 

Ordinance is unconstitutional 
on 
its 
face,” 
they 
wrote. 

“Unlike commercial products, 
a city seal and flag do not 
enjoy trademark protection. 
As a content-based restriction 
on free speech, the ordinance 
is subject to strict scrutiny 
and 
cannot 
survive 
that 

rigorous test. And requiring 
the 
mayor’s 
permission 
to 

display the seal or flag is a 
classic unconstitutional prior 
restraint on speech.”

City Council enforced the 

ordinance in the case of Ann 
Arbor resident Ed Vielmetti, 
who was notified to cease 
and desist after using the city 
seal on an Ann Arbor page 
on 
localwiki.org 
about 
the 

seal itself. Vielmetti called 
the letters he and the parent 
organization 
of 
LocalWiki 

received “threatening.”

Vielmetti 
spoke 
at 
the 

meeting Monday, saying he 
appreciated 
City 
Council’s 

effort 
to 
narrow 
the 

prohibitions on using the seal.

“The letters, although they 

were not a ticket, were very 

clear threats of a $10,000 fine,” 
Vielmetti said. “So I thank 
all of you who voted for this 
amendment, and I will thank 
those of you who will change 
your vote next time.” 

Councilmembers Jack Eaton, 

D-Ward 4, Jeff Hayner, D-Ward 
1, and Anne Bannister, D-Ward 
1, voted against the amendment 
to the ordinance.

The 
changes 
to 
the 

ordinance strike the permitting 
provisions while specifically 
allowing Ann Arbor to obtain 
an injunction to stop “unlawful 
use of the flag and/or seal.” 
While debating the resolution, 
Hayner 
asked 
Matthew 

Rechtien, senior assistant city 
attorney, about a theoretical 
situation in which an elected 
official used the city seal on 
social media.

“If I was a councilperson, 

which I am, and I had some 
kind of social media account 
and I presented myself in front 
of the city seal and I said, ‘Vote 
no on this, vote yes on this, 
vote for this person, don’t vote 
for that person,’ would you 
consider that a violation of the 
council rules?” Hayner said. 
“Would you consider that using 
the city property?”

Rechtien refused to answer 

Hayner’s hypothetical, saying 

he would need all the facts 
before offering legal advice.

“I’m just not going to get into 

judging a vague hypothetical 
here on the record in a council 
meeting,” Rechtien said.

Councilmember 
Zach 

Ackerman, 
whose 
Twitter 

header was the city seal, said 
he thought Hayner’s question 
was in reference to him.

“I realized now my cover 

photo on Twitter is the seal 
of the City of Ann Arbor, 
and I think Councilmember 
Hayner may be alluding to 
that and I would just say if you 
take objection to that you’re 
more than welcome to just 
call me and I’ll change it if it 
makes 
you 
uncomfortable,” 

Ackerman said. “I haven’t once 
thought about it until this very 
moment.”

Councilmember 
Kathy 

Griswold, D-Ward 2, said she 
regretted that City Council had 
passed the original ordinance 
at all.

“The fact that we wasted 

staff resources to write this 
ordinance in the first place 
and 
we 
are 
now 
wasting 

staff resources to talk about 
whatever conversation we’re 
having tonight troubles me and 
I apologize,” Griswold said.

T

hough we are basking 
in the light of the new 
year, we cannot forget 
an utterly devastating realization 
that the world came to after the 
Intergovernmental 
Panel 
on 
Climate Change released a special 
report regarding global warming 
near the end of 2018: Continued 
human activity causing greenhouse 
gas emissions will raise the global 
temperature by 1.5 degrees Celsius 
by 2040, predictably causing severe 
and unprecedented effects of climate 
change. Perhaps the most feared 
aspect of this issue is the unknown 
and the questions that arise from the 
sole phrase “climate change”. We 
have come to connote this phrase as 
something that we should be fearful 
of, but why? In essence, I believe that 
when we choose to come to terms 
with the issues of climate change and 
educate ourselves on what must be 
done to prevent it, then we will open 
ourselves up to a collective that will 
make the large-scale effort feasible. 
Furthermore, it is crucial to outline 
how the effects of the predicted 
climate change will affect all of our 
lives, not to strike fear into your 
hearts but for the reason that we will 
all be able to do more when we know 
more.
As a result of increased global 
warming, public health, food and 
water security, human security and 
international 
economic 
growth 
are likely subject to risks by climate 
change. The IPCC is highly to 
moderately confident that increased 
global temperatures will cause 
complications for the livelihood 
of disadvantaged and vulnerable 
populations, intensify the risks of 
ozone-related illnesses and vector-
borne diseases and minimize the 
net yields of crops among major 
continents. As we continue activities 
that increase the overall temperature 
of the atmosphere, we are making 
ourselves more susceptible to disease 
and impoverished conditions in 
underprivileged areas. Ultimately, 
this exemplifies how the populations 
of all lifeforms susceptible to 
calamities will not be the ones who 
are directly contributing to the 

damage, and thus spur arguments 
that global injustice has become 
prominent in the wake of self-
propelling maneuvers made by 
world leaders. Not only will we be 
affected by the complications created 
for our public health, but we will also 
be responsible for the leaders we 
choose to direct our state towards 
just or injust climate action.
Current pathways that have 
been suggested for limiting global 
warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius 
will require rapid and extensive 
transitions in energy, land, urban 
infrastructure 
and 
industrial 
systems. The IPCC is highly 
confident that the use of existing 
technologies to reduce carbon 
dioxide emissions in industry will 
be limited by economic capacity 
and large-scale industrial capacity. 
Additionally, the transition of 
urban 
infrastructure 
will 
be 
limited by institutional and socio-
cultural 
barriers. 
Finally, 
the 
transition of agricultural land use 
will be limited by technological 
and 
environmental 
barriers 
across regions. As we take steps 
that attempt to reduce the overall 
temperature of the atmosphere, 
we will be challenged by the 
interconnection of the sectors 
within our society that will be 
affected accordingly. As a result, 
people of all societal sectors will 
have to develop effective methods 
of collaboration and diplomacy 
as we look to compromise on 
the optimal way to proceed with 
generating solutions.
While we maintain hope that 
we can alleviate the climate change 
issue with the correct action, it is 
important to understand that the 
scale of adaptation that will be 
necessary if we fail to completely 
mitigate these issues may not be 
of a capacity that is feasible to us. 
The IPCC is moderately confident 
that while there are dozens of 
adaptation options for reducing 
the risk to natural and managed 
ecosystems, sea level rise and 
economic growth in urban areas 
and adaptation to ecosystems, food 
and health systems will likely be 

more challenging. This is due to 
the adaptation capacity of these 
vulnerable regions becoming more 
limited with increased warming. 
Furthermore, it is important that 
we begin to strategize how we 
can eliminate the issues posed 
by climate change completely 
rather than prepare to adapt to the 
repercussions, because it is unlikely 
that successful and total adaptation 
will be possible.
Despite my worries regarding 
global warming and climate change, 
I am confident that the steps taken by 
institutions hosting leaders in public 
research and initiatives towards 
developing solutions for these large-
scale environmental issues will 
continue growing in significance 
and thus contribute to implemented 
solutions. As a part of the Blue 
Sky Initiative formed during the 
end of 2017, a team composed of 
professors, directors and program 
managers within various schools 
at the University of Michigan was 
created in the summer of 2018 to 
create the Global CO2 Initiative. 
The objective of this team is to 
research and identify commercially 
sustainable approaches that can 
be pursued to reduce global CO2 
emissions using a system-level 
process of technology assessment, 
technology 
development 
and 
commercialization. 
Principal 
investigator Volker Sick, a professor 
at the University, has expressed the 
team’s eagerness to follow through 
with the initiative in a statement 
following the 24th Conference of 
the Parties to the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate 
Change held in December 2018, 
“The conclusion of COP24 in Poland 
we believe marks the end of official 
climate 
diplomacy 
and 
begins 
the era of climate action. Carbon 
management 
technologies 
and 
policies will be part of this new era 
and we are excited about sharing in 
this mission with all of you.”

Should Britain really Brexit – and can they?

ZACK BLUMBERG | COLUMN

I

n the summer of 2016, Great 
Britain stunned the world 
by 
passing 
the 
“Brexit” 
referendum to leave the European 
Union. 
However, 
as 
Britain’s 
deadline to finalize a deal with the 
European Union over the terms 
of their departure grows nearer, 
the mood in Britain is starting to 
change. The sense of confusion 
that had previously enveloped the 
debate over Brexit is slowly being 
replaced by panic, as Britain inches 
closer to the March 29 deadline with 
no deal in place. As beleaguered 
Prime Minister Theresa May 
desperately negotiates with both 
Parliament and the European 
Union, something has become 
clear: Britain shouldn’t leave the 
European Union, and under the 
terms Brexit was voted through on, 
it really can’t.
First, there’s the simple fact 
that leaving the European Union 
would create problems for Britain. 
According to research done by the 
Confederation of British Industry 
in 2016, 71 percent of CBI member 
businesses 
reported 
that 
the 
Britain’s membership in the EU 
has had an overall positive impact 
on their business. The positive 
impacts these businesses mention 
are likely tied to the numerous 
economic benefits Britain receives 
as an EU member: access to a single 
European market through the 
elimination of tariffs between EU 
member states and the increased 
negotiating power Britain had in 
the global marketplace thanks 
to the EU’s ability to negotiate 
as one entity. Additionally, the 
EU’s free movement policies have 
proved beneficial for both British 
businesses, who used the policies 
to plug labor gaps with foreign 
workers, and British citizens, who 
used the policies to find jobs abroad 
in other EU states (there are more 
than 
750,000 
British 
citizens 
working abroad in the EU). While 
nationalists complain about the 
influx of immigrants from poorer 
Eastern European countries such 
as Poland and Hungary, Britain 
needs immigration. Since 1973, 
Britain’s birth rate has been below 
replacement level every year (it is 
currently 1.8 births per couple). An 
aging, declining population would 
put an immense strain on Britain’s 
public services. To top it all off, 

Britain’s position within the EU is 
already more advantageous than 
that of a standard member: Britain 
is allowed to use its own currency, 
the British pound, meaning the 
value of its currency is not tied to 
the economies of other EU nations.
While 
pontificating 
about 
the economic advantages Britain 
currently enjoys as an EU member 
is one thing, another grimmer 
and more immediate issue faces 
Brexit right now: On the terms 
it was promised, it appears to 
be 
completely 
infeasible. 
For 
starters, using a simple majority 
as a trigger for leaving the EU was 
a nonsensical decision that went 
against Britain’s own precedent. 
In 1975, Britain held the United 
Kingdom European Communities 
membership referendum, which 
was a vote on whether they 
should remain in the European 
Economic Community. The British 
government carried out this vote 
to demonstrate public support; 
subsequently, 67 percent of the 
electorate voted to remain a part of 
said Common Market. To ensure 
consistency, this same procedure 
should have been used when 
leaving the EU, and would have 
helped ensure strong support for 
leaving, instead of the chaotic mess 
Britain currently finds itself in. 
Potentially, there could be grounds 
for holding another Brexit vote 
on the principle that a 60 percent 
majority should be required.
Secondly, Brexit negotiations 
will 
simply 
never 
satisfy 
Parliament, making a deal between 
the European Union and Britain 
unworkable (and for Britain, the 
only thing worse than leaving 
the EU with a bad deal is leaving 
the EU with no deal at all). The 
simple truth is that there are too 
many parties and too many issues 
— it would be near impossible 
for May to come up with a deal 
that appeases everyone. Between 
trade regulations, oversight of the 
Ireland-Northern Ireland border, 
and the status of customs unions, 
there are too many partisan 
interests at play for May to create a 
solid coalition.
Parliament isn’t the only group 
May 
cannot 
persuade; 
British 
citizens who voted to leave might 
have even higher expectations of 
what May can wrestle out of the 

EU. The abundant lies spread by the 
Leave campaign in the lead-up to the 
Brexit vote drive these unrealistically 
high expectations. As part of their 
campaign, Leave guaranteed that 
leaving the EU would allow an 
additional £350 million per week 
to be invested into National Health 
Services, while economic analysis 
showed the actual number was 
closer to £250 million (the campaign 
was called out for this lie a few days 
before the vote and walked back 
on it, but not before convincing 
nearly half of British voters it was 
true). Additionally, Daniel Hannan, 
a member of Parliament for the 
Conservative Party who helped lead 
the Brexit movement, said before the 
vote, “Absolutely nobody is talking 
about threatening our place in the 
single market.” Since then, May has 
repeatedly explained that leaving 
the EU means leaving the single 
market. In creating a campaign 
backed heavily by falsehood and 
exaggeration, Leave has placed 
unattainable expectations on May, 
meaning no deal she brings back can 
satisfy British citizens who voted for 
Brexit on the basis of Leave’s false 
promises.
While 
Britain 
should 
do 
everything it can to try to stay in 
the EU, overturning Brexit will 
be difficult. With May unlikely to 
back down, the responsibility falls 
to Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the 
opposition Labour Party, to call for a 
no confidence vote, allowing Labour 
to gain a majority in Parliament and 
hold a referendum to overturn the 
initial decision. It might not be easy, 
but with so little time left to avoid a 
no-deal Brexit, it seems like Britain’s 
best option.
Lastly, this piece only exists 
because of deceptive campaigning 
and ill-informed voting. In a 
world heavily influenced by social 
media, it is more important than 
ever that we hold institutions 
accountable for what they publish, 
and simultaneously work to be 
informed citizens and voters. 
While we at home haven’t voted 
for anything as long-term or 
consequential as Brexit, the mere 
existence of this column is a 
reminder of the duties we have as 
citizens of a democracy.

MILES STEPHENSON | COLUMN

S

croll through the average 
news or social media feed 
and you’ll see exclamations 
about the end of times. Whether a 
claim about the incoming nuclear 
war, Trumpmania and the fall of 
democracy, or an indictment of 
children’s 
overconsumption 
of 
technology, many seem to be up in 
arms about the state of the world in 
2019. But how bad are things truly? 
And how does the world today 
compare to the world just a few 
generations ago?
Surely if the world was nearing 
apocalyptic standards we would 
see 
an 
increase 
in 
negative 
statistics, particularly in the youth 
of today. As the sample of the 
population that would be most 
likely to reflect the consequences 
of modern societal changes, we 
should see an increase in violence or 
drug use or hateful demonstrations 
among today’s youth if the panic 
were to be believed. This, however, 
is the opposite of reality. Today, 
teens are using less drugs and 
alcohol than the generations that 
came before them, having less 
unprotected sex and are exercising 
more, reflecting an unprecedented 
societal 
consciousness 
about 
physical well-being. Despite the 
sensationalist 
media 
coverage, 
gun violence is far lower now than 
in 1993 (a whopping 49 percent 
decrease), teens are less likely to 
bring weapons to school, and teens 
are less likely to fight at school. 
Teens are also more proficient 
in 
writing 
and 
mathematics, 
more likely to wear seatbelts and 
less likely to experience hate 
comments. As the news website 
Vox puts it, “today’s teenagers are 
the best-behaved generation on 
record.” So where does this massive 
concern for the “smartphone” 
generation 
come 
from? 
Some 
experts point to “juvenoia,” or the 
exaggerated fear of the effects of 
social change on youth, as the root 
cause. Michael Stevens, a popular 
American educator, explains this 
phenomenon. 
“Children 
are 
the future of the species, so it’s 
reasonable to assume that nature 
would select for features in a 
species that cause adult members 
to prefer the way they were raised 
and distrust anything different. 
After all, parents by definition, 
were 
a 
reproductive 
success 
for the species; they made new 

members. So whatever choices and 
influences brought them to that 
point must have been good enough. 
Any deviation from that could be a 
problem.”
But perhaps these seismic crises 
must be viewed from a worldwide 
perspective, not just from the well-
being of the newest generations. 
From this standpoint, however, 
nearly every positive statistic about 
human life has increased as well. 
Around the globe, life expectancy 
has doubled since 1800. In the 
next three decades, more people 
will receive formal education 

than in all of human history up 
to this point, and everywhere 
people are earning three times 
more than they did in 1950. World 
Resources Institute reports that 
“Worldwide, the number of people 
living on less than $1 per day-the 
international standard for extreme 
poverty-has dropped from 1.25 
billion in 1990 to 986 million in 
2004,” and even countries in 
states of extreme privation today 
have 
lower 
infant 
mortality 
rates than the most successful, 
safe countries in 1950. Since the 
dawn of humans, inequities have 
persisted, and it is unlikely that 
we will ever eradicate them from 
society. That said, the general 
standard of living has improved 
for the average person. Those that 
would have once been relegated to 
famine and homelessness in a past 
society can now enjoy experiences 
that would have been viewed as 
luxuries for most of history. As 
the Heritage Foundation reports, 
“The typical poor household, as 
defined by the government, has a 
car and air conditioning, two color 
televisions, cable or satellite TV, a 
DVD player, and a VCR.” This point 
is made not to belittle the woes of 
those struggling with poverty, 
but instead to show how far the 

definition of what it means to be 
“poor” in the world has improved. 
This revolution is largely from 
contributions 
in 
science 
and 
medicine from countries like the 
United States and from institutions 
dedicated to the improvement of 
mankind including the University 
of Michigan.
Even when looking at the 
state of the environment, a realm 
of news saturated with doomsday 
predictions, the prevalence of the six 
major pollutants – carbon monoxide, 
lead, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, 
ozone and PM2.5 – in the atmosphere 
has fallen dramatically. Furthermore, 
carbon emissions in the United States 
have decreased steadily since the 
1940s and the biggest trend of 2018, 
“The Straw Ban,” helped introduce 
the issue of plastic pollution in our 
oceans to the public imagination. 
This isn’t to say the environment 
faces no ecological issues. There’s a 
long road ahead for humans in their 
struggle to manage the health of the 
planet and to mitigate the effects 
of climate change, but I believe 
no solution will be met before we 
consider an appropriate appreciation 
for how technology and the Internet 
has helped us make things better.
The quality of life on Earth is 
increasing every day, and nearly 
every statistic available argues that 
there is no better time for a human 
to exist on our planet than this very 
moment. And yet, this apocalyptic 
thinking endures. For most of history, 
this kind of thinking would have 
been appropriate, as disease, famine, 
oppression and suffering plagued 
the majority of humans. But in 2019, 
I believe we need to update our 
outlook. I’m not advocating for blind 
positivity, nor the lack of appropriate 
criticism when corruption or the 
misallocation of resources occurs. 
Instead, as I reflect on the coming 
of the new year, I advocate for an 
appreciation of the unprecedented 
well-being of mankind and the 
role technology and medicine have 
played in improving life on our 
planet. Research and educational 
institutions like the University must 
continue to do their part in improving 
humanity, but it’s OK, from time to 
time, to stand back and marvel at the 
genius of the modern world.

In 2019, let’s celebrate humanity

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

It takes only a page or two of 
reading to realize that the cover 
of “Milkman” is deceptive. The 
binding of the 2018 winner of 
the Man Booker Prize depicts 
an innocuous, fluorescent-pink 
sunset — one of those once a year, 
stop-and-snap-a-photo sunsets 
that makes “Milkman” stands 
out among its fellow books.
The 
sedative 
lightness 
of the cover seems to admit 
innocuousness. But “Milkman” 
is not innocuous. Nor is it gentle, 
or quiet, or apologetic — nothing 
that the cover may suggest about 
a subdued, romantic narrative. 
To say I wasn’t excited to read 
the Booker winner would be a 
lie — based on the superficiality 
of covers and excerpts, I have 
rooted for “Milkman” since its 

nomination on the long-list — 
but the way I fell in love with 
reading “Milkman” was not in the 
pleasant, blushing manner I had 

expected. It was a cycle of shock, 
recoil and return.
Anna 
Burns’s 
third 
novel 
narrates the story of an 18-year-
old girl (referred to as “Middle 

Sister,” as none of the characters 
in “Milkman” are prescribed 
actual names) over the course of 
two months. Her unnamed town 
is saturated with violence — 
violence from the ubiquitously 
demonized 
enemy 
countries 
“over the water,” violence from 
the renouncers of the state that 
control Middle Sister’s town and 
violence from the state police 
as they intervene in a village 
of 
scattered 
revolutionaries. 
Surprisingly, though, this war-
zone setting is but an offhand 
normality in the book. Instead, 
it is Milkman, a paramilitary 
that begins making unwarranted 
advances on middle sister, that 
takes the place of chief antagonist 
in the book.
At first glance, Burns lays out an 
insidious landscape that seems to 
hyperbolize the dark experience 
of growing up as a woman in 
the late 20th century. Maybe,

BOOK REVIEW

The last “Revisiting” piece 
I wrote covered “Mad Men,” a 
show that many deem to have 
ushered in the “Golden Age” of 
television, along with classics 
such as “The Sopranos,” “Six 
Feet Under” and “Deadwood.” 
In a similar vein, Joss Whedon’s 
“Buffy 
the 
Vampire 
Slayer” 
has occupied a space where its 
mixture of cult status and critical 
acclaim has elevated it into the 
pantheon of legendary TV.
And yet, I spent the first 18 
years of my life never watching 
it — not due to my ignorance of 
its existence, but rather because 
I thought it had a “silly name.” 
Over its nearly 150-episode span, 
“Buffy” 
somehow 
traversed 
nearly every sociological and 
philosophical 
quandary 
you 
could think of. Its basic premise 
is that the protagonist Buffy 
(Sarah Michelle Gellar, “The 
Crazy Ones”) is a special teenager 
endowed 
with 
superhuman 
strength and other attributes to 
help defeat the demonic presence 
in her hometown of Sunnydale, 
California. Her group of friends, 
known as the “Scooby Gang,” 
help her throughout the process. 
It still took me embarrassingly 
long to stop dismissing the 
fantastical, 
supernatural 
elements of the show, even 
though it is these very elements 
that make the show so intriguing. 
Academics, in particular, seem to 
have an affinity towards the show, 
creating (perhaps facetiously) 
a new academic field called 
Buffy-ology to analyze the social 
dynamics it portrays. To them, 
the demons and monsters can 
be compared to anything from 
terrorists to sexual predators. It 
is possible, due to its influence, 
that popular culture is becoming 
a more respectable subject of 
study. 
I still maintain that the show 
took entirely too long (nearly two 
seasons) to find its groove. But 

when it did, it really did. It features 
some of the best portrayals of 
young adult life I have seen on 
TV, both acknowledging but not 
belittling the drama and emotions 
that pervade it. It handles high 
school life especially well, leading 
to a slight dropoff in quality after 
many main characters eventually 
graduate. 
The 
“Buffyverse” 
has 
remained so popular through 
the years that it has permeated 
nearly every form of media. For 
starters, the series “Angel,” a 
spinoff centering on the vampire 
of 
the 
same 
name 
(David 

Boreanaz, 
“Bones”), 
received 
similar 
amounts 
of 
acclaim. 
There have been (frankly not very 
good) novels, six video games 
and recently, an in-development 
sequel. 
“Buffy” may not have the 
prestige drama veneer of “Mad 
Men” or “The Sopranos” or the 
gritty realism of “The Wire,” but 
that does not mean it is necessarily 
any less complex. “Buffy” is 
fantastical and surreal, but it 
uses those elements to make as 
valuable a social commentary as 
the former, all while dismantling 
TV tropes and norms that were 
all too prevalent in the era. 
“Innocence” 
(Season 
2, 
Episode 14)
This is the episode that firmly 

convinced me the show was on a 
path towards greatness. It starts 
as a touching portrayal of young 
love 
and 
sexual 
awakening, 
but the turn it takes as a result 
was my first true jaw-on-the-
floor moment in the series. 
While Buffy’s loss of innocence 
is heartbreaking, it aids in her 
development, allowing her to 
end the episode a stronger, 
more mature character. Perhaps 
the most resonant aspect of 
the episode is the fact that 
the emotions Buffy feels are a 
universal experience at that age, 
even if we do not have to go out 
and kill demons. 
“The Body” (Season 5, Episode 
16)
“The Body” lies in the same 
tier of episodes as “Ozymandias” 
and “College.” In a show whose 
strengths lied in its subtle use 
of music and sound effects, this 
episode contained neither. Sure, 
it is a painful watch, containing 
barely any (if at all) catharsis. 
Like Buffy, we are dragged on 
a 
rollercoaster 
of 
confusion, 
sadness 
and 
horror, 
lacking 
any 
discernible 
explanation 
or justification for what just 
happened. It’s actually one of 
the 
less 
fantastical 
episodes 
of the series, which makes the 
events that transpire even more 
shocking and brutal. It tackles 
human mortality in a way that we 
can all relate to. 
“Hush” (Season 4, Episode 10)
It takes a tremendous amount 
of skill to make a compelling 
episode of television with little to 
no dialogue. Like the more recent 
episode of “Bojack Horseman” 
(“Fish Out of Water”), “Hush” 
features little speaking roles due 
to a group of ghouls stealing the 
voices of Sunnydale’s residents. 
These ghouls, known as “The 
Gentlemen,” are some of the 
show’s creepiest beings, even 
scaring the cast during the 
episode’s production. Overall, 
the episode is an intriguing 
examination of the power of 
language in its ability to express 
clearly yet also to obscure.

REVISITING SERIES

We 
are 
all 
constantly 
running out of time. In reading 
that sentence you just ran out 
of at least one second. If that 
gives you as much stress as 
it does me, this list is for you. 
Reading to me is like food and 
air — I can’t go a day without it. 
But, recently, getting through 
entire novels seems to be 
taking up far too much of my 
time. Yet, I still crave the act 
of reading. The creative thrill 
of piecing together strings of 
words into images that only 
your mind pays witness to can 
be addicting. This is why I’ve 
started to maximize the most of 
my time and brain capacity by 
reading short fiction. Through 
reading short fiction, I feel as 

though I’ve fulfilled my thirst 
for creative reading in the 
least amount of time possible. 
The short stories I’ve read are 
quick, important and detailed, 
and can be found online for 
free. And, conveniently, are in 
the following list. 
1. “At the Birthplace of 
Sound” by Akil Kumussary
The author of this short 
story, Akil Kumussary, is a 
recent 
Charles 
Pick 
South 
Asian Fellow in fiction. Her 
novel “Half Gods” has gone 
on to achieve critical acclaim, 
being selected as the Editor’s 
Choice for the New York Times 
Book Review. She was also 
my creative writing professor 
last semester. I accidentally 
stumbled upon her short story 

while doing research for this 
notebook. 
After 
thinking 
“That’s 
my 
professor!” 
I 
began to read the story. Upon 
finishing it, I thought, “Oh my 
God … that’s my professor.” 
If you’ve never read anything 
written in the second person, 
I’d suggest starting at this 
story. The use of second person 
allows the story to come alive 
in a way third or first person 
wouldn’t allow. Kumussary’s 
prose alone is enough to keep 
the reader interested. Every 
sentence is not only needed but 
wanted. She depicts the “not-
so-quite” and “almost enough” 
limbo all people go through 
in a way that isn’t pitying, but 
celebratory of the excitement 
in the “in-between” moments 
of life.
2. “A Trip” by Claudia Ulloa 
Donoso (Translated by Lily 
Meyer)
Akil assigned this story as 
required reading in her class. 
In this piece of flash fiction 
not reaching over 1,000 words, 
the main character goes on a 
vacation in the stomach of her 
cat. The story is unexpected, 
hilarious 
and 
would 
pair 
perfectly well with a cup of 
morning coffee.
3. “Marzipan” by Aimee 
Bender
I 
discovered 
Aimee 
Bender 
last 
semester, 
and 
she has easily become one 
of my favorite authors. Her 
collection 
of 
short 
stories 
titled “Girl in the Flammable 
Skirt” should be on everyone’s 
to-read list. “Marzipan” was 
one of the stories in this book 
that particularly stood out to 
me. All of the stories in this 
collection are told through the 
perspective of a woman. They 
all possess a certain type of 
fantastical flare. “Marzipan” 
focuses on how it feels to lose 
a parent. The story starts off 
with a woman being concerned 
over the fact that her husband’s 
stomach has taken on the shape 
of a donut — with a gaping hole 
in the middle, coincidentally 
happening after the passing of 
her father-in-law. The woman 
then becomes concerned with 
her own stomach, as she is 
impregnated at age 50. The 
story takes a gruesome turn 
for the best, but you’ll have to 
read it to find out more. It is a 
whacky and creative metaphor 
for loss and grief. Bender trusts 
the minds of her readers are 
as wild and interesting as her 
own.
3. “The Coast of Leitrim” by 
Kevin Barry

After 
reading 
this 
short 
story in The New Yorker this 
October, I understood love a 
little better than I had before. 

You meet the main character 
alone 
in 
his 
dead 
uncle’s 
cottage. An infatuation (or is it 
love?) with a barista takes away 
his loneliness for a bit. Was 
that all this barista did for him, 
though? Check out this short 
story to uncover more about 
this character and his lonely 
and realistic journey through 
love.
4. 
“Puppy” 
by 
George 
Saunders
Who would I be if I didn’t 
include a George Saunders 
story in my list of recommended 
short 
fiction? 
Saunders 
is 
acutely aware of the terrible 
things humans do, and he’s also 
aware of the humor that can 
be found in it. The short story 
“Puppy” was actually the first 
piece of fiction I read by him. 
The wit and pacing in this story 
immediately had me inclined 
to read more. Featured in his 
book of short stories “The 
Tenth of December,” “Puppy” 
is a sad and strangely hilarious 
recounting of the adoption 
of a puppy. This seems like 
a 
wholesome 
activity 
but, 
naturally, humans find a way to 
mess it up.
Diving into any of these 
stories will open your eyes to a 
world you haven’t experienced 
before. 
The 
authors 
are 
brilliant. 
The 
stories 
are 
emotionally resonant. The time 
it takes to read them is short. 
Take a break from your day 
and enter the world of someone 
else’s for a bit. I promise you, 
it’ll be worth it.

Burns seems to suggest, the 
descent of society would look 
like this for all genders. But on 
second thought, the landscape 
Middle Sister walks — and how 
her 
hyperaware, 
rightfully-
paranoid thoughts congeal in 
it — becomes painfully real. 
Middle 
Sister’s 
encounters 
with Milkman while walking, 
her fears of being drugged, the 
pernicious comments coming 
from third brother-in-law, all 
resonate uncomfortably with 
the realties meeting women 
today.
This daring, critical kick 
at that experience of being 
a 
woman 
pays 
off. 
The 
apotheosis of the book’s dark 
and applicable portrayals is 
perhaps Tablets Girl, a “girl 
who was actually a woman,” 
that is one of the local outcasts 
in Middle Sister’s town due 
to her propensity to poison 
people. This usually takes place, 
most suitably and without 
retribution, in bars. People flee 
from Tablets Girl, people watch 
their drinks when Tablets Girl 
is around. It’s not just Burns’s 
clear allusion to date-rape 
that that is to be appreciated 
here, but her spiked humor and 
exaggeration also.
This 
is 
not 
to 
reduce 
“Milkman” down to a forced, 
constricted focus on gender-
politics 
though. 
Burns’s 
writing alone is remarkable 
(something I refuse to say 
passively). 
“Milkman” 
is 

brimming with endlessly long 
paragraphs, 
lose-your-train-of-
thought stretched sentences and 
digressing thoughts from Middle 
Sister that render the book 
incredibly complex. At first, I 
was perturbed by this formal and 
royal-esque writing, especially 
upon 
an 
encounter 
with 
a 
paragraph spanning four, almost 
five, pages. But as I continued, I 
found myself — in an unlikely way 
— reading Middle Sister’s voice 
in an uninterrupted pattern even 
more critical and translucent 
than I expected possible. This is 
assisted by Burns’s near-perfect 
draw of synonyms through the 
book, making her writing appear 
dependably careful and personal.
I 
was 
enamored 
by 
the 
characters in “Milkman” and 
the abrasive humor that was 
tacked onto them. It isn’t often 
that I get a full cast of characters 
(narrator, 
antagonist, 
family) 
that are so real, so exciting to 
encounter. 
Most 
memorable 
are the “wee sisters,” Middle 

JOHN DECKER
Daily Arts Writer

Sister’s three younger sisters 
who, despite their young ages, 
are infatuated with topics such 
as French revolutionaries, going 
through “Kafka phases” and 
eavesdropping every moment 
they get. Characters like the 
wee sisters offer unexpected 
gratification 
along 
Burns’s 
dark timeline of events. The 
real 
humor 
displayed 
make 
“Milkman” 
all 
the 
more 
authentic and pleasurable.
I love “Milkman” because it 
is a fruitful attempt to offer me 
hints of a human experience I 
will never be able to understand, 
let alone be familiar with. 
Perhaps the most evocative 
and vivid account in the vein of 
social-rebellion and unwanted-
gaze I have ever encountered, 
“Milkman” is a narrative that 
has been told repeatedly, even 
frequently in the 21st century. 
Burns’s 
unequivocal 
writing 
turns this narrative into a 
fearsome chant, one well worth 
shouting along to.

‘Milkman’ investigates the 
modern day with ingenuity


The world is familiar with the 
professional killer trope: “Star 
Wars,” the James Bond novels and 
even Pulp Fiction all include some 
reiteration of the same type of 
character. And for the right reason: 
Readers devour these stories. The 
remorseless, accessible killers exist 
in realms where the borders of 
reality are difficult to identify, and 
excitingly easy to contort.
Un-Su Kim takes this trope 
to a new level in his first book 
translated to English; all of the 
characters in “The Plotters” are 
assassins except for a select few. 
These are not paid killers who are 
hired by someone else for dramatic 
effect, the killers themselves are 
the central focus of the book. 
Kim looks deep into the killers’ 
humanity and at the complex 
socio-political sphere they operate 
within.
“The 
Plotters” 
settles 
its 
crosshairs over Reseng, a thirty-
something Korean man who has 
been working as a for-hire assassin 
for years. Adopted by Old Raccoon 
(a vacant, older man who works in 
tandem with assassins) as a child, 
this world is all Reseng knows. 
He flourishes in an environment 
where men labelled “Plotters” 
take orders for homicides, in turn 
handing these orders and victim 
profiles over to assassins. It is an 
environment where corruption 
is ubiquitous, tacitly suggesting 
that, everyday, disappearances or 
political deaths — outright murder 
or not — are the result of the 
Plotters and their transactions.
While “The Plotters” at times 
seems unsure of what it is trying 
to accomplish plot-wise, it is in his 
characters that Un-Su Kim shines 
as a writer. The characters in the 
novel are diverse in temperament 
and realistically formed — greatly 

nuanced for the “typical” assassin 
type. While initially the novel 
is 
disproportionately 
saturated 
with men and (at times, the 
often accurately ludicrous) male 
perspective, 
Kim 
thankfully 
escapes this trough by the final 
half of his novel. He offers several 
female characters, most centrally 
Mina, who is, along with Reseng, 
one of the most fantastically formed 
characters. Mina is both flawed and 
a badass. She takes on stereotypical 
female propensities that authors 
often disregard when employing a 

“strong woman” archetype. She is 
annoyingly talkative, cares about 
her physical appearance and is 
physically meek. Simultaneously, 
however, she fights for a cause, 
is 
remarkably 
intelligent 
and 
remains the calmest amongst all of 
the characters in the face of peril. 
She is a shining example of Kim’s 
ability to craft truthful, balanced 
characters. Mina, while certainly 
imperfect, is a refreshing offer of a 
female character in a thriller novel. 
Authors molding (usually female) 
characters often feel the need to 
choose between good and bad, 
between “manic pixie” and socially 
altruistic. Mina, along with the 
many other characters of “The 
Plotters,” is allowed to be both.
The story of “The Plotters” is 
interesting. The writing is good, for 
the most part. There are certainly 
sloppy lines, especially when it 
comes to dialogue, though this 

perhaps can be attributed to the 
translation element of the novel. 
Depending on the intensity of 
the scene at hand, the book is not 
remarkably difficult to put down. 
There are gripping scenes —they 
just do not come with frequency.
Although its characters stand 
out, “The Plotters” slips into an 
ill-fated middle ground between 
literary fiction and the thriller-
mystery fiction familiar in works 
such as “The Girl on the Train.” 
Kim seems unable to decide on 
one territory — or perhaps is just 
unwilling to examine both 
territories entirely at the same 
time. There are two or three 
especially moving scenes in the 
work where Reseng’s humanity 
(and sometimes his inability 
to adhere to it) is revealed. 
Principals of love and loss are 
toyed with eloquently.
However, 
these 
passages 
falter when Kim later neglects 
them, juggling instead with 
his thriller plot, trading blood 
and adrenaline for half-hearted 
examinations of literary themes 
every few chapters. It is difficult 
to be wholly enamored with “The 
Plotters,” especially when sincere 
themes seem diluted by a desire 
to continue to force moments of 
drama and violence.
Thrillers, both onscreen and 
read, are often made or broken by 
their ability to trick audiences and 
retain their attention for the span 
of the story. Characters such as 
Reseng and Mina — characters that 
feel remarkably authentic — do this 
uniquely, as it is hard not to lean 
into their stories and human depth. 
“The Plotters” is a good thriller 
for its willingness to investigate 
outside of the at-hand, adrenaline-
begetting drama and the novel 
takes refreshing breaths. In the 
future, hopefully Kim expands the 
appeal of his work with even more 
of these voyages.

‘The Plotters’ a thriller

Doomsday. The End of Days. The 
Rapture. Whatever name it takes, 
the dramatization of the moment 
of reckoning for the human race 
continues to fuel the film industry 
without fail. By now, Hollywood 
has presumably squeezed out every 
last plotline possible about the 
world’s demise. Yet, even after 2012 
came and went, the end-of-life-
as-we-know-it craze persists. Our 
expectations for films within this 
genre are understandably low, given 
the common threads of painfully 
predictable plotlines, poor action 
and weak direction found in films 
like “The Knowing,” “2012” and 
“This is the End.” However, “Bird 
Box,” Netflix’s latest apocalyptic 
flick, is perhaps an outlier within its 
class. Fresh, thought-provoking and 
terrifying, through Sandra Bullock’s 
talent and strategic fiddling with 
chronology, “Bird Box” offers more 
than the flame-filled skies, splitting 
streets and screaming pedestrians 
that we expect of it.
Cynical loner Malorie (Sandra 
Bullock, “Gravity”) cannot help but 
dread the invasion of her solitary 
lifestyle her progressing pregnancy 
will inevitably yield. While initially 
detached from the influx of news of 
mass suicides occurring overseas, 
Malorie is thrust into panic when 
the glazed-eye, suicidal individuals 
materialize 
within 
her 
town. 
Somehow escaping the mayhem 

alive, Malorie and a slew of fellow 
survivors determine the key to their 
survival is to blind themselves to the 
outside world, realizing that through 
seeing, they will likely meet the 
same fates as the corpses littering 
the streets. As tensions build, fears 

grow and literal darkness ensues, 
the survivors struggle to maintain 
their humanity as they adapt, 
quickly learning their realities will 
never be the same again.
Though riddled with moments 
of confusion we manage to follow 
along (our hearts racing every step 
of the way) to the end of the film, 
thanks to Sandra Bullock’s superb 
acting. Malorie serves as our much-
needed guide through the bizarre, 
post-apocalyptic world that “Bird 
Box” conjures. Her sturdy, no-bull 
demeanor produces a character 
who is consistent and tangible. 
Viewers, like the terrified characters 
within the film, are desperate to 
latch onto something solid amidst 
the unpredictable and harrowing 
backdrop of their world — where 
a tool as essential as eyesight is 
limited. Along with her firmness, 
viewers are able to find comfort 
and solace in the quiet relationship 
Malorie 
builds 
with 
fellow 
survivor, Tom (Trevante Rhodes, 
“Moonlight”). The refreshing thing 

about this romantic subplot is its 
subtlety.
Also working in the film’s favor 
is its usage of time. Two parallel 
timelines operate to show the 
present and the past. Viewers 
begin the movie in a state of utter 
confusion, following a blindfolded 
woman and two children down a 
daunting, gray river. Audiences, 
drawn in from this point of curiosity, 
have most of their questions 
answered in the second timeline, 
which illustrates flashbacks from six 
months prior. Our furrowed brows 
slowly begin to relax as we begin 
to piece together the intersections 
between present and past.

While elements like Bullock’s 
acting chops and the manipulation 
of time make “Bird Box” an 
intriguing watch, it should be 
known that this is not in any way a 
mild or ‘light’ movie. The sensations 
we are left with after watching are 
comparable to those that linger after 
sitting through an episode of “Black 
Mirror.” We are impressed and 
fascinated by the film’s imagination 
of a reality where sight, a quality 
that is normally so simply taken for 
granted, is restricted. At the same 
time, however, over the course of the 
film, we develop a sickening twist 
in our stomachs, nauseated and 
distressed by the unpleasant nature 
of humans in crisis. Its intense fear 
factor aside, “Bird Box” should be 
praised for its inventiveness. In 
fact, the film’s simultaneous ability 
to make us jump with fright and 

Bullock bold in ‘Bird Box’

Getting cozy in Detroit 
for The Internet’s show

CONCERT REVIEW

There’s 
something 
so 
satisfying about going to a 
concert to catch a break from life 
kicking your ass. On December 
12, when I was sinking in the 
mire that was the final days 
of fall semester, I nonetheless 
decided the best use of my time 
before a final exam was to drive 
to Detroit to see The Internet 
(yes, the band) live. Despite 
some logistical hiccups, which 
resulted in me driving alone, in 
a borrowed car, with a manual 
transmission, I still managed 
to scoot down the highway 
to Detroit. On the downtown 
streets, I avoided the high-vis 
vest types harping their parking 
lots and opted to poorly parallel 
park only a block away from the 
venue.
Walking to the steps of Saint 
Andrews Hall and beholding 
people still waiting in line 
almost an hour after doors 
opened 
was 
an 
omen 
the 
atmosphere 
that 
night 
was 
going to be electric. A pat down 
and a trip to will call later, I 
was armed with a photo pass 
on my wrist, which gave me 
William Miller from “Almost 
Famous” levels of confidence 
as I smooth-talked my way 
into the exclusive VIP seating 
upstairs. 
Opener 
Moonchild 
took the stage as soon as I found 
an advantageous spot to settle 
on the railing. Their brand was 

slightly Vulfpeckian, lo-fi funk 
with tinges of pop and jazz.
They were nothing to write 
home about until the main 
vocalist, Amber Navran, and 
the two pianists flanking her 
sides each pulled a saxophone 
or trumpet seemingly out of 
nowhere, much to the crowd’s 
surprise. 
Maybe 
it 
was 
a 
testament to the audience’s 
attention level that we didn’t 
notice the array of instruments 
at their feet for a song or two, 
but after they busted out the 

brass, our eyes and ears were 
captivated 
by 
their 
sweet 
symphony.
Moonchild didn’t stop there; 
they showcased their talent 
as multi-instrumentalists by 
playing flutes and clarinets to 
boot. While the crowd gathered 
was not quite their mellow 
target audience, we still vibed 
with them, especially when 
they got everyone chanting 
along to a cover of Jill Scott’s 
“A Long Walk.” They exited to 
joyous applause, not stealing 
the show from the main act but 
serving up a savory appetizer: 
the perfect kind of opener.
After Moonchild had packed 
up their instruments and bright 
lights flooded the venue once 
again, the wait for the top-billed 
band was par for the course 
(read: almost criminally long), 
but the in-house stereo system 
kept it lively, which is almost 
too easy to do in Detroit when 
you play “First Day Out” by Tee 
Grizzley. So when the music 
abruptly cut and the lights went 
dim, the audience was roaring. 
A 
five-man 
wrecking 
crew 
piled onto the tight platform to 
the opening kicks and snares 
of “Roll (Burbank Funk),” and 
immediately everyone in the 
packed Saint Andrews Hall was 
bobbing to the music.
Both the crowd and band 
were in perpetual motion the 
remainder 
of 
the 
evening, 
stopping only for a second 
after the intro song when 
frontwoman, Syd, took a swig 
of her drink from a paper cup 
and set it down near a speaker. 
“Hold on, let me secure this tea,” 
she said to the crowd’s laughter, 
as drummer Christopher Smith 
started to play the opening notes 
of “Dontcha.” Other than that 
track, the setlist was comprised 
of cuts from Ego Death and their 
2018 release Hive Mind, with 
the 
balance 
unsurprisingly 
favoring the more recent.
The 
first 
half 
of 
their 
performance was more geared 
to cutting a rug, with crowd 
favorite singles “La Di Da” and 
“Come Over” doing the heavy 
lifting. And yes, The Internet 
had two literal Persian rugs 
on stage, a couch stationed on 
top of them. While Smith and 
producer Matt Martians mainly 
sat behind their drum set 
and synthesizer respectively, 
guitarist Steve Lacy, bassist 
Patrick Paige II and Syd didn’t 
hesitate to get comfortable. 
Paige and Syd flopped on the 
couch and cheered on Lacy as 
he took over for “Beat Goes On,” 
while Syd and Lacy sat in awe of 
Paige’s meditative verse which 
closes out “It Gets Better (With 
Time),” a song that Syd took a 
somber moment to dedicate to 
their late friend Mac Miller.
On 
stage, 
The 
Internet 
looks a motley bunch, each 
aesthetically adding their own 
stylistic flair: Lacy, who I am 
convinced can make any piece 
of clothing look hot, rocked a 
tie-dye shirt, split toe boots 

and a rainbow guitar straps; 
Syd was unassuming in her 
plain white T-shirt and ultra-
flared pants; Smith happily 

drummed along without a shirt. 
Much like the crowd packed 
within walls of the venue, The 
Internet represents a variety 
of ages, backgrounds, styles 
and personalities. But together, 
they somehow make it work, 
and get the crowd to work in 
unison, too. As Syd and Lacy 
slowly strode from side-to-side 
strumming and singing along to 
“Curse,” the mass on the main 
floor copied them, swinging in 
sync with the twosome like the 
Hall was playing Simon Says.
We were enchanted by the 
love songs, but also bounced to 
the triumphant songs like “Get 
Away” and “Just Sayin.” For 
the latter, Syd even coached us 
through the hook (“You fucked 
up!”) recognizing the audience’s 
adrenalized 
engagement. 
“I 
know how Detroit get loud as 
fuck,” she yelled, a wide smile 
on her face. With a longer-
than-average set and magical 
prowess, they gave us a reason 
to get loud. Everyone left with 
vibrancy coursing through their 
veins.
The Internet ended their set 
a tad unceremoniously, but with 
a good sense of humor: They 
picked up their instruments 
and shuffled off-stage as the 
“Curb 
Your 
Enthusiasm” 
theme played. Perhaps a bit 
ironic, as I had to return to 
the empty reality of the bleak 
winter night outside and Ann 
Arbor where work awaited, 
or perhaps a bit self-aware, as 
The Internet keeps up with the 
constant pressure of touring 
as they continue across the 
United States before embarking 
for 
Australia 
and 
Europe. 
Nonetheless, exams happen and 
sold-out shows will be played, 
because on nights like this, The 
Internet reminds us the beat 
goes on.

This must be 
the place

“
”


I

n terms of an introduction, this is a column about 
nothing in particular. But it’s also a column about 
anything under the sun. I don’t know if this affords 
me unmeasurable literary freedom or if it cages me in, 
wandering aimlessly around the halls of banality. But as 
a circus manager in charge of transporting the big top 
from town to town has probably said at least once, “Let’s 
get this show on the road.”
If you’re my mom, you might know I used to write a 
column in Statement called “Soundtracking,” where I 
would pair events and feelings with specific songs in an 
attempt to highlight the musicality of life, which is often 
filled with repetition and been-there, done-thats. If you 
happen to not be the woman who brought me into this 
world and supported me in everything I ever did (even 
during the mullet phase in middle school), you probably 
have no clue that column existed. And I’m okay with that. 
It was an experiment in exploring myself.
Every two weeks, Statement editors (sometimes much 
to their dismay I’m sure) afforded me the privilege of 
scrolling through Spotify playlists and recounting tales 
of embarrassment, profound life changes and even my 
own lackluster deflowering on one specific occasion. But 
every time I sat down to write — and even now, as I sit 
at my desk hoping the patron saint Billie Holiday will 
give me something of value to say — I wrote to destress. 
I wrote to take a moment for myself. I was comfortable 
where I was, click-clacking away obnoxiously because I 
never learned how to type.
No seriously, I never learned how to type. My right 
hand goes wild but my left pecks and only covers like 10 
or 15 keys. I look like that gif of Kermit the Frog at the 
typewriter, but only typing 30 or 40 words per minute. 
But back to writing.
I wrote that column because I felt as though it was 
where my needs and skills (or lack thereof) fit best. And I 
absolutely loved it. I had the freedom to revel in my past 
embarrassments, to explore the deepest caverns of my 
memory and share them with the world. I was able to toy 
with the past while staying incredibly present. Now, it’s 
the future I’m scared of.
C

ut back to this most recent Thanksgiving — the 
worst holiday when you don’t have a concrete, 
step-by-step answer to the foreboding question, 
“What are you thinking post-grad?” The question looms 
over every conversation with every third aunt 18 times 
removed. Even when the words aren’t leaving their lips, 
you can see it in their eyes. It’s like when parents can’t 
wait to ask the waitress how their day’s been.
Some inquiring adults I can evade with a simple, “I’d 
be happy in anything as long as I’m writing.” I do mean 
that wholeheartedly, but it really does the trick to get 
people off my back. Then I can go on my merry way. But 
one especially persistent relative dared to hit me with the 
follow-up.
“But what does that mean, Matt? What happened to 
journalism?”
“Ummmmm…”

(Before I have the chance to respond) “You’re almost 
21! You can’t not know what you’re gonna do after you 
graduate.”
Dat shit hurted.
After that one interaction, I lied awake at night, try-
ing to imagine a million different futures — my own fig 
tree straight from Plath. I made so many yellow legal pad 
lists, scrawling internship pathways, connections to call 
in, everything a higher-education institution has taught 
me to do. It’s not what you know, but who you know. But 
how am I supposed to figure out who I know if I don’t 
even know myself?
Over every gust of wind on this campus, every echo, 
I hear a voice. The voice demands your future be set in 
stone. Whether it’s your own decision or someone else’s 
— what you do, the voice cares not. But the voice badgers 
me every day for not knowing exactly what my plan for 
the future is. If I don’t have a pathway I can confident-
ly outline to any newcomer who demands one, maybe I 
should just do what others want me to do instead. Then I 
never have to figure it out myself.

A

n hour ago (an hour from writing, not an hour 
real time from when you’re reading this. That 
would be crazy if I could time that out), some-
one asked me what my plans are this semester. When I 
told them about being a deputy Statement editor — and 
how I planned on taking a step back from the 24/7 News 
process I used to be entrenched in — I was hit with a big, 
fat “Why?”
And now I would like to present to you a list of ques-
tions it is acceptable to ask someone when they are excit-
ed about their new job on Statement, even if it doesn’t fit 
in your expectations of what you thought they might do 
with their life:
“What are you guys thinking about doing with State-
ment?”
“Are your occasional columns gonna be like 
Soundtracking? Your mom told me those were great!”
“Why are you so strapping and handsome?”
And here’s a list of questions that aren’t acceptable:
“That seems like a step back. Why don’t you want to 
do more?”
“Don’t you love The Daily?”
“Why are you already crying? It’s only 9 a.m.”
I know this isn’t their fault (especially the crying bit). 
It’s just our immediate reaction. We expect people to 
strive to do the most they can for the things they love. 
And I do love The Michigan Daily and News. With my 
whole heart. But I also love being able to experiment with 
other projects and mediums of expression. Taking a step 
back to bask in what you’ve created and focus on yourself 
shouldn’t be an instinctively interrogated decision.
But here’s where my typical, self-destructive behavior 
would kick in, telling me I’m being self-serving and let-
ting people down for not doing more.
This semester, I’m trying a new thing. It’s called confi-
dence. Haven’t heard of her before, but we’ll see how she 
is.I

n an ideal world, I just want to breathe. And we 
aren’t afforded much time to breathe at this uni-
versity. It’s four years, maybe five, and then you’re 
thrust out into the scary world like a newly christened 
ship embarking on its maiden voyage. Everyone wants to 
know about where the ship is going, but few ask how the 
ship’s doing as it bobs in the water. As a professor once 
told me when I almost broke down during office hours 
asking what I should do with my life, higher education 
should be a place for experimentation.
As members of this university and, even broader, as 
humans, we need to collectively encourage exploration. 
Because what typically follows experimentation is a bet-
ter understanding of self. And isn’t that what higher edu-
cation should be about? Finding out who the hell you are?
Take that ceramics class even if the credits won’t count 
for anything. Who says you can’t play mandolin? Tell the 
world to take its expectations of you and feed ‘em to the 
birds.
As Socrates probably once said, “Love yourself, you’re 
worth it, cutie.”

3B

M

y expectations of 
love and romance 
were doomed from 
the start. As a child, I lived and 
breathed Disney movies. The 
story was always the same: A 
beautiful princess was in trou-
ble and — shocker — a beauti-
ful prince came to save her. The 
perfect pair fall in love as soon 
as they look at one another, and 
BOOM! They’re set for life. To 
me, this cliché was reality. It 
was December 2010, and at 10 
years old, I was already scoping 
my classroom for viable bach-
elors. I was a fifth-grader ready 
to be in love.
AJ was a 4-foot-10-inch bru-
nette football player who was 
in my best friend’s class. In my 
mind, he was perfect boyfriend 
material. He was cool and ath-
letic: the perfect embodiment 
of an apathetic jock. I was a 
perky dancer, which in my mind 
was close enough to the classic 
cheerleader. We were bound to 
be perfect. I was determined to 
date him.
I told each of my friends 
about my crush, all part of my 
master plan of him finding out 
and then, of course, asking me 
to be his girlfriend. Elementary 
school gossip travels fast, so 
naturally, AJ knew I liked him 
by the end of that day. We were 
dating by that night.
The following Friday was 
a snow day, which set the 
scene for a perfect first date. 
We were invited to sled at my 
friend Emma’s house, and I 
immediately started planning 
strategies in order to make 
the night flawless. We would 
share a sled, and it would be 
just like the magic carpet ride 
from “Aladdin”. I’d get cold and 
he’d give me his jacket. Maybe 
Emma’s mom would make us 
spaghetti for dinner, and we 
could share a noodle like Lady 
and the Tramp. We could even 
watch a movie and he’d pre-
tend to yawn, then put his arm 
around me. To start the night 
off right, I secured the roman-
tic ambience by wearing a shirt 
that said “Free Hugs” — a flir-
tation tactic that nobody could 
deny. There was no room for 
error.
By the end of the night, 
everything 
had 
gone 
as 
planned. It was even more than 
I had hoped for because AJ had 

kissed me! It was just as roman-
tic as I had hoped for too, as we 
snuck off into Emma’s closet, 
closed our eyes, counted down 
from three, and leaned in. I 
was the happiest 10-year-old 
alive. I was proud of my cour-
age. I knew my brave efforts to 
put myself out there had paid 
off. Through hard work and 
determination, I had turned 
a fantasy into actuality. My 
two best friends showed their 
solidarity and agreed with my 
sentiments. And just as good 
friends do, they came back 
to my house, and we laughed 
about it all night. Not only was 
I in love, but I was an EXPERT 
on all things kissing!
“Was it on the lips or the 
cheek?!” Lips, obviously. This 
was the real deal.
“Who leaned in first?!” He 
did, duh! I was not that bold.
“Did you flick your foot in 
the air?” No, I didn’t. That only 
happens in the movies.
It was all fun and games until 
my mom came home. As soon as 
she walked into my room, she 
could tell something was up. 
I saved myself the interroga-
tion and blurted out the good 
news. My boyfriend kissed me! 
I expected a parade of joy, a 
giant hug, a mazel tov.
Instead, I was humiliated.
My mom explained to me that 
I was 10 years old, and kissing 
is inappropriate. Could I even 
imagine what the other fifth-
graders would say if they found 
out? I didn’t even think about 
other people during my plan-
ning process — in the movies, 
no one else’s judgement mat-
ters but of the couple in love. I 
didn’t think that my behavior 
could be considered improper. 
I didn’t think kissing could 
be classified as such a taboo 
action. But the more I thought 
about it, the more anxiety I felt. 
The once present feeling of sol-
idarity began to fade as my best 
friend whispered to me, “Some 
girls may think you’re a... slut.”
A slut.
I had to keep it a secret 
because if not, I was destined 
to be the class slut.
A fifth-grade slut.
I cried the entire night. How 
could I be so slutty and not 
even realize it? I was gross. I 
felt an uncontrollable feeling 
of emotion come over me, an 

emotion I had never truly felt 
before. It was the perfect storm 
of humiliation, distress, anxi-
ety and embarrassment caused 
by an understanding that my 
behavior was unacceptable. It 
was my first true encounter 
with the emotion that I would 
come to know as shame, and 
I had to get rid of the linger-
ing disgust immediately. The 
only way I knew how was to 
continuously deny it even hap-
pening, shown by breaking up 
with AJ and swearing every-
one involved to secrecy. No one 
else could know about what I 
thought was the first skeleton 
in my closet.
One of the main things I 
learned from my dabble in pro-
miscuity is to never to trust 
fifth-graders to keep a secret, a 
truth that I was naive to at the 
time. Just like before, elemen-
tary school gossip travels faster 
than the speed of sound, and by 
the end of the following Mon-
day, everyone knew about my 
first kiss. Denying it became 
impossible. By the end of the 
week, even the girls from the 
elementary school in the other 
part of town knew. Apparently, 
they didn’t want to be friends 
with the Deerfield girls any-

more. We were too slutty for 
them.
I was a 10-year-old who 
already 
knew 
shame, 
who 
already felt the ostracism asso-
ciated with sexual experimen-
tation. I was a 10-year-old girl 
who wanted romance and love 
and flowers and a boyfriend 
and an innocent kiss. I instead 
was labeled a slut.
Thankfully, 
10-year-olds 
tend to forget and move on. 
Girls started kissing boys regu-
larly as soon as we hit middle 
school. I quickly became yes-
terday’s news, and my embar-
rassment eventually subsided. 
I no longer felt the humiliating 
consequences of my actions. 
Instead, other girls were con-
demned to the ruthless ridicule 
associated with sexual curios-
ity.
My friends have been sub-
jected to any of the following: 
easy, prissy, whore, prude. Slut.
Whether it’s an experience 
that happened in college or an 
innocent fifth-grade kiss, the 
backlash is inescapable. But 
I’ve grown to realize that the 
backlash isn’t worth it. People 
will always pass judgements; 
people 
will 
always 
inflict 
shame. But by understanding 

this very feeling of shame is 
defeatable, I have been able to 
grasp that wearing my actions 
as armor is the most redeeming 
form of resilience.
I’ve watched “The Breakfast 
Club” thousands of times, and 
one quote always seems to stick 
with me.
“If you say you haven’t (had 
sex), you’re a prude. If you say 
you have, you’re a slut. It’s a 
trap. You want to, but you can’t, 
and when you do, you wish you 
didn’t, right?”
There’s no right answer. 
There will never be a right 
answer. No matter the action, 
or even lack thereof, there 
will always be the tempta-
tion of what seems to be an 
inevitable feeling of disgust, 
embarrassment, 
distress, 
humiliation. Shame is a col-
lection of unasked-for ridi-
cule, controlling the actions of 
the curious, condemning the 
actions dauntless.
And with that, I’ve learned to 
accept that I will forever be the 
10-year-old girl with an open 
heart, vulnerable only to Dis-
ney princesses’ rare side effect 
of promiscuity.
If that makes me a fifth-
grade slut, then so be it.

Annie Klus /Daily 
The Good News Accapella group performing.

I

t’s a Saturday night in mid-December, 
and despite the freezing temperatures 
and the impending tempest of finals, 
Angell Hall Auditorium A at the University 
of Michigan is packed. Students and families 
have crowded into the rows of cramped seats, 
and there’s a folding table along the back wall 
piled high with veggie trays, cookie platters 
and boxes of Entenmann’s Little Bites. The 
biannual Good News Christian a cappella 
concert is about to start.
The performance begins with a video, pro-
jected on the screen at the front of the room. 
In the video, Good News members do a vari-
ety of skits about the ordinary stresses of col-
lege life: an awkward date at Bubble Island, a 
looming exam, catching the flu at an inconve-
nient time. All this, they explain, is why they 
feel a bit unprepared for the concert — but the 
show must go on. The video ends with the 
Good News crew opening the doors of Audi-
torium A. As their on-screen counterparts 
enter, so do the flesh-and-blood members of 
the group. The lights turn back on, and the 
show begins. Whatever I expected from a 
performance by the University’s only Chris-
tian a cappella group, this wasn’t it.
A 

few weeks before the concert, I 
spoke to two Good News members 
at a tiny table in the South Univer-
sity Espresso Royale: LSA sophomore Maica 
Mori and Information graduate student Luke 
Thompson. Mori is in her second year with 
Good News, and Thompson is in his fifth 
(he’s been a member since his sophomore 
year of undergrad). Both Mori and Thomp-
son arrived at the University unsure about 
how they would integrate their faith into col-
lege life.
“I knew I wanted to be a part of a singing 
group,” Mori explained. “A capella seemed 
cool.”
When she stumbled upon Good News 
online, she was intrigued. “I felt really strong-
ly about Good News,” she said. “Joining it has 
been one of the best college decisions.”
“My sophomore year, I tried to get more 
engaged with the University,” Thompson 
said. “I thought I would try to embrace the 
faith I’d been brought up in and just see if that 
would help me get to know people and under-
stand my faith better.”
Singing has always been important to both 
Mori and Thompson, as both a part of wor-
ship and outside it. 
Thompson grew up Lutheran, and since 
coming to college, he’s tried out a few dif-

ferent churches in southeast Michigan. He 
recently settled on Zion Evangelical-Luther-
an Church of Detroit, a 600-seat neo-Gothic 
stone building located down the street from 
the historic Senate Theater.
Mori was raised Apostolic Pentecostal, a 
Christian sect with wildly different tradi-
tions than Lutheranism.
“I grew up going to a church that has a lot 
of bands, worship, music, open worship every 
Sunday,” Mori said. “So I’m used to collective 
singing Christian songs,”
“And I come from a bunch of stoic Ger-
mans,” Thompson joked.
Good News members were raised with 
all kinds of Christian denominations, which 
Mori and Thompson believe is part of the 
group’s strength.
“I grew up in maybe a kind of an older style 
of church,” Thompson said. “So seeing people 
who worship in a different way — people who 
have emotion as more prevalent in the way 
they worship — it sort of teaches me about 
how they understand things and I’m able to 
impart stuff I’ve learned in a more traditional 
setting.”
“You can come from a very specific 
denominational background, but then when 
you come to Good News, you can meet other 
Christians and see different worship styles 
and different ways that people live out their 
faith,” Mori added. “It really causes you to 
grow as a Christian.”
Mori explained the Apostolic Pentecostal 
traditions are much more emotive than those 
of the Lutheran services Thompson grew up 
attending.
“It’s the complete opposite side of the 
coin,” she explained. “It’s a newer (type of 
Christianity), a whole mixed bag of people. 
It’s very much big displays of worship. It’s 
completely different. I visited Luke’s church 
before and it’s the traditional cathedral thing 
— the priests came up and they did the goblet 
of wine.”
At her church, things are far less formal. 
“It’s very much open,” Mori said. Sometimes, 
she explained, people even dance during ser-
vices. “If some people show emotional dis-
plays, it’s completely acceptable. If people are 
crying, things like that.”
Though she began college unsure of how 
faith would fit into her new routines and 
rhythms, Mori explained the strength of 
other Good News members’ devotion has 
helped her realize that a life with God is the 
one she wants and needs.

I asked Mori if Good News has changed 
the way she thinks about religion.
“In more ways than I could talk about with 
our time,” she said. “It was really cool because 
coming into college I had this thing, like, I 
didn’t really want to go to church as much as 
I used to. My faith was really waning. I would 
talk to God sometimes and be like ‘God, to be 
honest, I might take a break from church, I’m 
not really sure about this.’”
After joining Good News, her initial uncer-
tainty evaporated. Mori said it is the specific 
blend of community, singing and faith that 
makes Good News such a good fit for her.
When I asked about the primary goal of 
the group, they explained the group doesn’t 
really have a single, defined aim.
“It’s kind of a fun question,” Thompson 
said. “I think if you ask different members 
of Good News, you’d get slightly different 
answers. I mean, ultimately we’re united 
around the Good News. We want to tell peo-
ple that are Christian or people that are not 
Christian that Jesus died so that they could 
be forgiven.”
“It’s a prayer set to a tune,” Mori explained. 
“It’s worship set to a tune.”
Music for prayer is nothing new.
“Gregorian chant is like the first a cap-
pella,” Thompson said, “There are reasons 
they would sing instead of speak everything. 
There’s a long history in Christianity of 
using music to express prayer. It’s thousands 
of years old — we’re just adapting it to the 
times.”
To prepare for their performances, they 
spend the first hour and a half of rehearsals 
singing. The last 30 minutes are devoted to 
fellowship.
This can take on a variety of different 
forms. Sometimes members of Good News 
meet in a stairwell in the Modern Languages 
Building to sing and worship. Other times it’s 
bible study, games, prayer or announcements.
“You meet people who are passionate 
about music and who are passionate about 
God,” Thompson said. “You get these situ-
ations where everybody is definitely differ-
ent people but we’re able to unite. We’re not 
just uniting in the way that a lot of choirs do, 
where you’re uniting because you’ve got to 
make this music sound good. We’re united in 
our faith, ultimately.”
A

s someone who doesn’t take part in 
organized religion, my discussion 
with Mori and Thompson gave rise 
to questions I knew they probably couldn’t 

answer. I wondered, in the way I think all 
agnostics and atheists do: How are you so 
certain? Do you ever have doubts? But these 
didn’t feel like questions I could ask them. I 
was there to learn about Good News, not to 
interrogate the basis and tenacity of their 
faith.
The closest we came to discussing the 
experience of belief — the actual physical 
feeling of piety — was when they talked about 
singing. They told me about the overwhelm-
ing sense of peace and harmony they felt, 
strong enough to break through stage fright. 
About performing a solo, surrounded by their 
friends, their brothers and sisters in Christ.
This, at least, felt as though it shared a 
boundary with something I could under-
stand. It reminded me of something I learned 
about two years ago in a class whose material 
mostly escapes me now.
I took Sociology 100 my freshman year. 
The class blurs together with the rest of first 
semester: milk stained with dining hall cere-
al, the bridge to the Hill, long evenings lost in 
the strange rush of explaining my whole life 
to new friends. But one concrete lesson I have 
not forgotten from Sociology is something 
LSA lecturer Terence McGinn told us about 
concerts. Bear with me. I promise this con-
nects to Christian a cappella.
A few years ago, McGinn had a student 
who wrote an honors thesis about the sociol-
ogy of concerts. The student was interested 
in the experience of euphoric connection that 
many concert-goers report feeling. I found 
the thesis online. It begins with the author, 
Jeffrey May, LSA ‘10 and current Michigan 
Law student, describing his own powerful 
sense of ecstasy during a cover of the Talking 
Heads song “This Must Be the Place” by The 
String Cheese Incident.
I confess that I was already intrigued. I 
love “This Must Be the Place.” A few months 
ago, some Saturday night when it was still 
warm out, my friends and I sang it together 
as we walked home. We were on the corner 
of Washtenaw Avenue and South Univer-
sity Avenue, waiting to cross the street, and 
I remember how that moment made me feel 
more deeply what I’ve always sort of known 
to be true: that the chimerical promise of 
whatever is next will always be eclipsed by 
the hugeness of our anticipation. The mem-
ory of the stuff we were waiting for will fade, 
and what remains is everything else: dancing 
in someone’s living room while the sun sets, 
the quiet walk home.

“I’m just an animal looking for a home and / share the 
same space for a minute or two.”
I think the most tender, supreme pleasures of friend-
ship and community come when we acknowledge the 
shared things (God, the Talking Heads) that make us feel 
our own expansiveness. Still, it is — and I say this self-con-
sciously — far easier for me to understand Jeffrey May’s 
exhilaration than it is for me to imagine Mori or Thomp-
son’s.
When I listened to The String Cheese Incident’s cover 
of “This Must Be the Place” on Spotify, I thought 
it was just all right. May even admits that he 
didn’t initially think much of the rendition. But 
as the music began to build upon its own energy, 
something changed for him.
“As the last verse commenced, I started to feel 
as though I was possessed by an outside power, 
and my whole body swelled with an alien energy. 
With this possession came a feeling of empower-
ment and a sense of peace and calm — everything 
was finally alright,” May writes. He hesitated to 
tell anyone about this experience: “I thought that 
they would have no understanding of what I had 
seen and experienced: a chance encounter with 
what I could only desperately call the divine, the 
transcendent. Had I found God?”
I’ll spoil the thesis here: May decides that it 
wasn’t God. Instead, he thinks it was collective 
effervescence, a theory proposed by sociolo-
gist Emile Durkheim. Collective effervescence 
is Durkheim’s way of explaining the heightened 
emotions that result from participation in a group 
activity. He argues that being in a group of people 
who are all on the same page — thinking the same 
thing, doing the same thing, hearing or singing 
the same song — can result in a sense of group 
identification so electrifying that it feels other-
worldly.
The word effervescence first came into use in 
the late seventeenth century. It comes from the 
Latin word effervescere, which means “to boil 
over” (ex- meaning “out” plus fervere, which 
means “to boil”). It wasn’t until the 1800s that the 
word took on its current meaning: vivacity, live-
liness. I like to imagine emotions bubbling and 
boiling over and making a mess. If only we could 
always let our interior life express itself this 
plainly: a temperamental liquid, prone to spilling. 
 
This might all seem only tangentially related 
to Good News, but as someone who isn’t reli-
gious, the idea of collective effervescence helps 
me understand why participation in this group 
is so important to its members. College neces-
sarily involves finding out which communities 
or friends speak to our multitudes, our peculiari-
ties and incongruities. We discover which groups 
draw out our most interesting selves — which 
ones make us feel effervescent — and which 
groups we find tedious and limiting. In Good 
News, members are allowed to be Christians, college stu-
dents and singers, all at once. It’s the recognition of the 
overlap between these identities that makes the group so 
special to its members.
***
I began this article with the intention of surveying 
niche clubs and organizations on campus. University tour 
guides tout the huge selection of student organizations — 
more than 2,000 — and I wanted to write about the most 
unique of the bunch. I thought I knew what the core of the 
story was going to be: that there are many, many clubs on 
campus, all of them addressing some specific intersection 
of identity and interest, all of them strange and silly and 
quirky and important. I interviewed the president of Craft 
Beer Club, the co-founder of Game of Thrones Club, the 

president of Cubing Club and the founder of CurlTalk. I 
couldn’t seem to go beyond the surface of the questions I 
was asking, though.
It wasn’t until I spoke to Mori and Thompson that I 
realized what these clubs have in common is not simply 
their specificity — it is the fact of their communality. Sing-
ing, praying, drinking beer, watching Game of Thrones, 
solving a Rubik’s Cube, celebrating natural hair: These 
things can all be done alone. There must be something 
special, then, about doing them in a group.
Fall of my freshman year, I joined Leim, the Univer-
sity’s only Irish dance group. I did Irish dance for about 
eight years growing up, and I wanted to keep dancing in 
college. As a kid, we mostly did solo dancing. Ceilis (group 
dances) were reserved for special competitions and our 
annual Christmas shows. But in Leim, we exclusively did 
Ceilis, and it reinvented Irish dance for me. I was in Leim 
for just one year, but it was exactly what I needed at the 
time: a tangible tie to my childhood, a group with whom I 
could feel identified beyond explanation.
In Leim, we didn’t talk while we were dancing. We 
were silent, hearing the music, feeling it, remembering the 
steps, moving our bodies together to make something big-
ger than ourselves. We held hands in a circle. We moved 
in and out and formed a line. Sometimes, before we got 
tired and cranky and forgot what we were supposed to be 
doing, the separation between our bodies and the music 
seemed to shrink to nothing. The sound was inside us; we 
needed it in order to dance and it needed us in order to 
play.
I may be biased, but Irish music seems to open itself up 
particularly well to this sense of interconnectedness. How 
delicately layered are its intricacies, how clean the sliding 
notes — the kind of sound that longs for movement. For 
me, there has always been a pure joy in the way the song 
fits the dance, in the body memory it inhabits. It engen-
ders certainty. It speaks us into conviction. Surely this 
can’t be so different from singing Christian a cappella.
***
James Verini wrote in the New Yorker that “This Must 
Be the Place” is the song that explains the Talking Heads. 
“It’s been covered by Arcade Fire, MGMT, and the jam 
band The String Cheese Incident, among others,” he 
writes. “There are books named for it. Hip brides march 
down the aisle to it. It’s quoted in mawkish editorials.”
What he means, I think, is that “This Must Be the 
Place” has become synonymous with a sort of ironic senti-
mentality, a wistful self-awareness that feels particularly 
easy to pin on young people (and people who miss being 
young). This article might very well be the mawkish edi-
torial that Verini dismisses. But I’d much rather be mawk-
ish than apathetic. I’m thinking of Leslie Jamison when 
she wrote, “I want our hearts to be open.” It seems both 
especially easy and especially hard to have open hearts 
in college. We want to be known for who we are, but we 
also wonder: Who are we? Perhaps having open hearts is 
the problem and the solution; we find those who make our 
hearts feel open by first opening them.
Humans are pack animals, college students even more 
so. We want to figure it out. A pizza is ordered; a final is 
failed; we call home. We call each other. We try to find 
the people who will help us move forward into the future 
and for whom we are able to do the same — the ones who 
bolster our certainty that the world is endlessly capable of 
containing whatever we can manifest.
Verini writes, “‘This must be the place’—it’s not a state-
ment of certainty, is it? It’s not ‘This is the place.’ It’s more 
‘This is what someone said the place was.’ It’s even a little 
desperate. ‘I don’t know what I’ll do if this isn’t the place.’”
College: Someone once told us that this was the place, 
and now we’re trying to see exactly what kind of place 
that is, and where within it we are supposed to fit. This 
must be the place — but only because we’re here together, 
because it’s all happening right now and this is where.

7B

I 

grew up in the arid valley where 
the moonlight was muffled by the 
smoke of thousands of coal-burning 
stoves. It was cold and scary at night and 
the day came, only to reveal the night’s 
crimes. Every morning, the newspaper 
delivered headlines of the number of peo-
ple, my people, who didn’t make it through. 
Dozens every month. Hundreds every year. 
It was an eye for an eye among my people. 
The vicious cycle of death and suffering 
continued uninterrupted for years.
Nobody was spared — not the rich, not 
the poor, not those who ran or those who 
hid. Every single person was affected. 
Family members started to go missing. 
Some came back and some were never seen 
again. Some were taken viciously and pur-
posely. Some were mere accidents of a rico-
chet bullet. Their deaths were quick and 
painless.
Nobody knew how to stop the misery, 
but everyone was learning every day how 
to live in it. There were no rules. Love was 
vanishing. We lived in a war zone, yet the 
world was unaware of our suffering.
I sat somewhere on the top branches of a 
tree looking out at Lake Michigan, unearth-
ing memories. It had been some time since 
I had been to Juarez, Mexico, but I still 
liked to open my chest of memories once 
in a while. I was afraid of forgetting about 
my people and their suffering, but was also 
privileged enough to be able to see it from 
the other side — o separate myself from it 
instead of live through it. I felt guilty some-
times. All of the femicides, the organized 
crime, the anarchy that ruled my city’s 
streets. I was away. I wasn’t there to see it, 
but all I could do was remember.
I 

remembered a woman and a girl in 
a car at dusk. They were driving on 
an empty avenue, their conversation 
dwindling because of a disagreement. A 
typical mother daughter interaction. The 

girl iced her mother out for picking her up 
early from a friend’s house, even though 
the mother had agreed to extend the cur-
few by a few hours.
Unbeknownst to the girl, who had just 
started la escuela secundaria (middle 
school), her mother was afraid. A crippling 
anxiety crawled up her spine, and the hairs 
in the back of her neck were permanently 
spiked. She would not be at ease until they 
crossed the 15-foot wall and electrified 
fence that separated their neighborhood 
from the city streets.
Safety is only a few minutes away, the 
mother thought to herself while she looked 
over to the passenger seat, where her 
daughter sat with her arms crossed and 
eyes fixed on the ground.
Her daughter’s face was no longer that 
of a little girl. It had started to trans-
form, along with her body, to give way to 
a woman. It was a dangerous time to be a 
woman in this city. Women had been dis-
appearing and dying here for decades, and 
there was nothing more dangerous than a 
girl and a woman in a car by themselves.
Suddenly, a car pulled up next to them. 
It was another woman. She was older, but 
the years manifested in a lovely way. This 
woman had the appearance of someone 
who wasn’t afraid anymore. She had seen 
too much. Lived too much. Suffered too 
much. She was there as an act of freedom.
During these years, no women dared 
going out of the house without their hus-
bands, especially not at night. Being by a 
man’s side gave them an illusion of safety, 
as if any man could have stopped what hap-
pened that night.
The light was still red when a small, 
white, battered-up Toyota driving on the 
cross street — the only other car within 
sight — stopped in the middle of the inter-
section. Two armed men poured out of the 
Toyota and headed straight for the older 

women’s car.
In the sliver of a second before the men 
came too close, the two women and the 
girl looked at each other. Their mouths 
watered and stomachs dropped at the sight 
of danger.
“Don’t look at them,” the woman said to 
her daughter.
The exact complexion of either of the 
men would remain a mystery, as neither 
of the women nor the girl could recollect it 
after the incident. But their presence was 
infinite. It was as if their bodies radiated a 
kind of heat that could permeate the doors 
of the car. Their presence seeped through 
the atmosphere and filled the veins and 
minds of the two women and the girl with 
fear.
The light was still red when the men 
went up to the driver’s side of the older 
woman’s car and pulled their guns out, 
pointing them at her head through the win-
dow, opened the door and yanked her by 
the arm. Her gesture of freedom, the brav-
ery of being in the streets on her own, left 
her kicked and bleeding on the ground. She 
wore a handkerchief around her head that 
was now covered in blood and dirt. One of 
the men took her purse as well.
When she saw this, the mother did not 
hesitate to accelerate through the red light. 
The men got into the cars and shortly after, 
the battered-up Toyota and the older lady’s 
car appeared in her rearview mirror. The 
old woman still laid frozen on the ground; 
becoming smaller and smaller as the cars 
drove away.
There might have been other red lights 
that night, but the mother did not stop at 
any of them.
She did not breathe until she had driven 
her car past the 15-foot stone wall and elec-
trified fence that divided their neighbor-
hood from the city streets. Her shoulders 
did not relax until she and her daughter 

were safely in their home.
She locked all of the doors and drew 
all the curtains. As if any physical barrier 
was going to stop the men who robbed and 
kicked a woman on the street from coming 
after them.
T

hat mother and daughter were 
me and my mother. When I think 
of it now, I always remember 
family, friends, sunny days and happiness, 
but the more I sit on top of trees unearthing 
memories, the more I realize how real and 
possibly traumatic my experiences were.
My family has been living across the 
border now for a few years. Here, where 
all the lawns are perfectly manicured and 
everyone wears braces, it is hard for people 
to understand what happened. It’s hard for 
anyone here to really know me when my 
past is so foreign to them. I could attempt 
to explain, but there’s no way to put these 
feelings into words.
I know I’m not from Juarez anymore, 
but it is important to never forget. To 
keep reliving those moments, as if it could 
change the fate of the city or my own. As if I 
could forget about the privilege of being on 
top of a tree looking out at Lake Michigan 
without a trace of worry. As if I could go 
back without being seen as a gringa.
I look back now, after spending most 
of my teenage years in Michigan, and I 
can pick out all of the ways in which I am 
different than my friends who stayed in 
Juarez. I think they can see it, too. When-
ever I am with them, I am the Michigander, 
but whenever I am with my new friends, I 
am the Mexican.
I sometimes feel like I don’t have a home, 
but what I do know is that I grew up in 
the arid valley where the moonlight was 
muffled by the smoke of thousands of coal-
burning stoves. It was cold and scary at 
night and the day came, only to reveal the 
night’s crimes.

MICHIGAN STAYS UNBEATEN, TAKES CARE OF IU

As Zavier Simpson converted 

a hook shot, extending the 
Wolverines’ lead to 16 with 
14:35 to go in the game, Indiana 
coach Archie Miller shouted 
and punched the air in anger, 
frustration spilling into body 
language.

Miller spent most of Sunday’s 

game standing on the visiting 
sideline with his hands on his 
hips, shaking his head after 
missed shots, exasperation 
open — putting on display just 
how far ahead Michigan is of 
his team.

If there was a game for the 

Wolverines to lose, this was it. 
Sophomore forward Isaiah Livers 
missed his second straight game 
with back spasms, meaning 
Michigan coach John Beilein 
had no choice but to rely on 
freshman Brandon Johns and 
redshirt sophomore Austin Davis 
at backup center. The Wolverines 

have sputtered in every game for 
a month. Indiana is a top-25 team 
with two All-Big Ten-caliber 
players in Romeo Langford and 
Juwan Morgan.

It took only minutes for 

Michigan (15-0 overall, 4-0 Big 
Ten) to prove otherwise, and 
minutes more for the Wolverines 
to take an insurmountable lead 
on No. 21 Indiana (12-3, 3-1) on 
their way to a 74-63 win.

This, in contrast to a month 

of games against subpar 
competition, was the Wolverines 
of November, back in full force. 
This was the team that went 
into Villanova and stunned the 
national champs, then ran North 
Carolina out of the building 
two weeks later. They stayed 
undefeated and they looked good 
doing it.

From the jump, this was 

Michigan’s game. Sparked by 
Charles Matthews on both 
ends, the Wolverines started the 
contest on a 9-4 run, extending 
their lead to 23-9, then 30-13, all 
before the 10-minute mark of the 

first half.

“We made some shots and we 

really guarded them,” Beilein 
said. “I think we were in better 

rhythm man-to-man, ’cause we 
just played Penn State — we had 
been into a funk there a little 
bit when we were just playing 
against all the zones. You don’t 
know how people are gonna play 
you. And so I thought we just hit 
a really good rhythm and we set 
the tone.”

Matthews, a redshirt junior, 

looked as good as he ever has in 
a Michigan uniform early on, 
getting to the basket and creating 
points in transition seemingly 

at will. He drew two fouls on 
Langford, a future NBA lottery 
pick, in the game’s opening 
minutes, then held the five-star 
recruit to 17 points on 5-of-11 
shooting. By the end of the first 
half, Matthews had 16 points 
on 6-of-9 shooting, ultimately 
finishing with 18.

“He’s a dominant scorer, 

and he’s a dominant defender,” 
said sophomore guard Jordan 
Poole. “And Charles doesn’t put 
himself in situations where he 
thinks about anybody else. Or 
matchups, or guys going lottery, 
or whatever situation. Charles is 
looking at who’s in front of him 
and he’s gonna try to kill him 
every night.”

In front of a multitude of NBA 

scouts, Matthews wasn’t the only 
one to impress. After two early 
3-pointers, Poole finished with 
18 points, his third straight game 
with over 15.

Indiana did manage to cut 

Michigan’s lead to single digits 
midway through the second half, 
buoyed by Langford and Morgan, 
who combined for 17 points in the 
first 10 minutes after the break. 
After junior center Jon Teske 
picked up his fourth foul with 
just over eight minutes to go, the 
window seemed open for the 
Hoosiers to mount a comeback.

Johns slammed it shut.
In 13 second-half minutes, 

Johns did everything asked 

of him, banging down low 
and slamming home dunks 
on his way to eight points and 
eight rebounds on the day — a 
performance that could see the 
backup center job become his to 
lose.

“He’s sort of trying to learn, 

‘What’s the next step? What’s 
the next play?’ And it’s just 
really simple things that, as the 
game slows down for him, he’s 
more capable of going further,” 
Beilein said. “But that was a 
matter of foul trouble by Austin, 
foul trouble by Jon (Teske) and 
Brandon getting in there.”

After the game, a calmer 

Miller stood at the podium trying 
to describe what happened, 
the same fate that has befallen 
the prior 14 coaches to face the 
Wolverines.

“Undisciplined,” he called his 

team. “Just some backbreaking 
plays. Fouling shooters. And 
again, not being able to convert 
some easy ones. Just led them 
to be able to, pretty much, 
comfortably play the game.”

Unlikely veteran Matthews dominates Langford

In the waning seconds of 
Sunday’s game, it was Charles 
Matthews who stood at center 
court, dribbling the clock 
out on the Michigan men’s 
basketball team’s win over 
Indiana. It was appropriate, 
for a game where, for much of 
it, the redshirt junior wing had 
been a focal point.
Coming into the contest, 
a 
lot 
of 
the 
focus was on 
his 
matchup 
with 
Hoosier 
wing 
Romeo 
Langford. They 
were 
both 
highly 
ranked 
recruits out of 
high 
school, 
and in a way a 
microcosm 
of 
the 
different 
ways recruits can turn out. 
Langford is the player who’s 
living up to his hype, an 
instant star for Indiana who 
revitalized the Hoosiers after 
a down year. Matthews is the 
guy who never thought he’d be 
here, a fourth-year player who 
transferred from blue blood 
Kentucky after plans to go 
one-and-done didn’t work out.
Matthews — as sophomore 
guard Jordan Poole noted 
after the game — doesn’t 
usually think about matchups. 
He just looks at what’s in front 
of him and takes it from there. 
But this matchup was a little 
higher profile than most.
“He was fired up about 
this matchup,” said Michigan 
coach John Beilein. “Because 
he’s got respect and he knows 
how good that Langford is.”
And going against Langford, 
Matthews had perhaps his 
best performance of the year — 
firing up not just himself, but 
the team around him, carrying 
it to its 15th straight win.
It was just the second 
possession of the game when 
Matthews stripped the ball 
from Langford, then drew a 
foul. After the inbound, Poole 
hit a jumper.

Just over three minutes 
later, Matthews threw down 
a dunk right over Langford 
— and to add insult to injury, 
Langford 
fouled 
him 
on 
the shot. Matthews missed 
the and-one, but the play 
contributed 
something 
far 
more important. Just four 
minutes into the game, one 
of Indiana’s best players was 
already in foul trouble. He sat 
much of the remainder of the 
half.
“That was a 
designed 
play 
to see if we 
could get that 
second 
foul,” 
Beilein 
said. 
“And 
Charles 
paid attention, 
taking the ball 
strong 
then 
right 
then 
... 
not be as strong 
with 
it. 
That 
was a strong baseline drive, 
and that’s who he can be.”
For the rest of the half, it’s 
who he was. Matthews added 
two more dunks in the half, 
including one off an offensive 
rebound. 
He 
imposed 
his 
will on the Hoosiers, not 
letting them take anything on 
offense or on defense en route 

to 16 first-half points, three 
rebounds and three steals.
And beyond that, Matthews 
provided a veteran presence. 
He may have been fired up 
more than usual because of 
the matchup with Langford or 
the bright lights of a big game 
at Crisler, but it carried over to 
the rest of the team and kept 
the Wolverines rolling to an 
11-point win.
“It’s a huge energy boost, 
for everyone, because he does 
so much,” Poole 
said. “He’ll get 
a tip deflection 
or he’ll go and 
he’ll get a steal 
or he’ll get a 
tip rebound of 
a 50-50 ball, so 
being 
able 
to 
see a leader out 
there 
hustling 
and being able to 
get easy buckets 
and transition buckets and 
being able to get the crowd 
going and give us a positive 
boost and positive momentum 
in any time in the game is 
definitely huge for a game like 
this.”
And that goes back to 
Matthews, 
the 
fourth-year 
player who wasn’t supposed 

to be here. But he is, and now 
he’s transformed into a vocal 
guy on a young team. He’s the 
only fourth-year on the team, 
so it falls to him to provide 
the energy. As he got going, 
Beilein realized it was time 
to get the ball in Matthews’ 
hands more often. The coach 
drew up plays for him and 
trusted him to do his job.
Matthews 
then 
went 
out 
there 
and 
disrupted 
everything, 
from 
Indiana’s 
shooting to its 
spacing to its 
defense. 
He 
held Langford 
to just 5-for-11 
from the field. 
He 
grabbed 
boards 
and 
forced 
turnovers 
to 
salvage empty 
possessions. 
Against a team 
like the Hoosiers, he made 
sure Michigan left nothing to 
chance.
“Don’t 
discount 
what 
Charles — Charles is just 
huge,” Beilein said. “It’s about 
winning. It’s about winning. 
This is his fourth year in 
college.
“Just wants to win.”

Redshirt junior Charles Matthews scored 18 points and held Indiana’s Romeo Langford to 5-of-11 shooting on defense.

“This is his 
fourth year in 
college. Just 
wants to win.”

“He knows 
how good 
that (Romeo) 
Langford is.”

With Livers out, Johns gets his chance and makes his introduction

For a minute there, Brandon 
Johns felt like he was in high 
school again.
With seven minutes left in 
the second half, Johns gathered 
a pass from junior point guard 
Zavier Simpson and tried a left-
handed layup off the glass. It 
bounced off the rim, but Johns 
popped straight back up over 
everybody and tipped the ball 
into the cylinder.
On 
Michigan’s 
next 
possession, Johns slipped a 
screen, caught Simpson’s pass all 
alone in the post and pummeled 
the ball through the net with his 
right arm.
Not 
enough? 
Twelve 
seconds later, the freshman 
forward — he of just 10 games 
of college basketball — leapt up 
to challenge Indiana forward 
Juwan Morgan at the rim and 
stuffed the All-Big Ten senior. 
What was left standing of Crisler 
Center after Johns’ dunk was set 
ablaze.
“It reminded me a lot of East 
Lansing (in high school),” Johns 
said. “Different levels, but it’s 
great to be out here.”
That 56-second sequence was 
a throwback to Johns’ high-
flying, highlight-reel high school 
career, during which he had 28.1 
points, 11.3 rebounds and 2.5 
blocks per game as a senior.
But in that same sequence, 
Johns arrived on the big stage.
His arrival was both long-
anticipated and sudden. Johns 
rode the bench for most of the 
Wolverines’ first 14 games as 
he acclimated to the college 
game. But for a Michigan 
team that struggled to find 
stability backing up junior Jon 
Teske, the 6-foot-8 Johns’ raw 
athletic ability was a tantalizing 
prospect; a perfect complement 
to the 7-foot-1 Teske at the ‘5.’
In the last week, Johns got the 
break he needed.
Sophomore forward Isaiah 

Livers missed last Thursday’s 
game against Penn State due to 
back spasms, and after feeling 
less than 100 percent in practice 
and warmups over the weekend, 
was listed as doubtful minutes 
before tipoff Sunday, his absence 
opening up an opportunity 
in the Wolverines’ small-ball 
lineup. And just over midway 
through the first half, redshirt 
sophomore 
center 
Austin 
Davis, Teske’s primary backup, 
committed his second foul.
“It 
was 
the 
need,” 
said 
Michigan coach John Beilein. 
“He’s 
making 
progress 
in 
practice, but we’ve seen that a 
few times in practice. … That 
was a matter of foul trouble by 
Austin, foul trouble by Jon and 
Brandon getting in there.”
Added Johns: “I just knew 
I had to be ready, know 
everything, defense, offense, just 
in case he does call my name, if 
somebody gets in foul trouble I 
can come out and contribute.”
He did just that, going straight 
to work inside and inhaling 
rebounds — four of them in 
less than three minutes. In 13 
minutes against the Hoosiers, he 
would finish with a team-high 
eight of them, along with eight 
points and a block.
“That’s one thing I’ve really 
been focusing on since I got 
here 
is 
just 
rebounding, 
play with a high 
motor,” 
Johns 
said. 
“I 
think 
rebounding 
was like what 
everyone 
thought 
the 
main thing that 
I could do, and 
if anything else 
followed up, it’s 
okay.”
In the second half, the rest of 
Johns’ game materialized in full 
force.
Just over six minutes into the 
half, Davis was sent to the bench 
for good after hacking Morgan; 

his fourth foul in as many 
minutes. With Teske on the 
bench with three and Indiana 
climbing back into the contest 
after trailing by 
as much as 17, 
the 
weight 
of 
the Wolverines’ 
perfect 
start 
came to rest on 
the shoulders of 
the callow East 
Lansing 
High 
School product.
The Hoosiers 
had cut the lead 
to 55-46 when 
redshirt junior forward Charles 
Matthews surged into the lane, 
his runner missing high off 
the backboard. Johns saw it, 
rocketed off the ground and 
powered home the rebound.
Turns out, that impressive 

display of athleticism was only 
the appetizer.
Less than two 
hours 
before 
his 
rejection 
of 
Morgan, 
it 
wasn’t 
even 
a 
sure thing Johns 
would 
play. 
Now, 
against 
a 
nationally-
ranked 
opponent, 
in front of a 
national TV audience, one of 
the most unlikely of players had 
taken complete control.
“I 
did 
not 
(see 
Johns’ 
performance coming), but I 
do know that he is capable,” 
Matthews said. “Injuries allow 
some people to step up and make 
the most of the occasion. He 
definitely had a big game, big 

impact for us.”
After 
the 
game, 
Beilein 
noted 
that 
Johns had been 
too 
passive 
in 
practice 
on 
occasion. 
The next step 
in 
Johns’ 
development, 
according 
to 
Beilein, 
is 
bringing 
the 
same energy he showed on 
Sunday more consistently.
“We’ll see how he does in the 
next two days,” Beilein said. “But 
there’s an argument for him to 
be the first big man off the bench 
after how he played today.
“... Just do this in practice and 
do this in games. He would tell 
you himself. We played four-on-

four the other day, full-court, 
four-on-four, no rules, he was 
a non-factor in the game. He’s 
good, he’s good. He’s got to be a 
factor in these games. … Playing 
harder, playing smarter, just 
embracing the contact is all I 
need to do.”
“I love the kid. He’s going to 
be a really good player.”
John’s 
breakout 
showing 
didn’t end when the final buzzer 
sounded. Nor did it end when 
he led the Wolverines in singing 
“The Victors” in the locker 
room.
As he left the Crisler Center 
media room and a swarm of 
reporters behind, a man in 
a 
Michigan 
sweater 
came 
up to him with a five-word 
declaration.
“Welcome to regular playing 
time.”

ALEXIS RANKIN/Daily
Freshman forward Brandon Johns had eight points and eight rebounds in his breakout performance against Indiana, perhaps cementing a regular role in the rotation.

“It reminded 
me a lot of East 
Lansing (in 
high school).”

“I did not 
(see Johns’ 
performance) 
coming.”

Jordan Poole emerging

Two months ago — back when 
the Michigan men’s basketball 
team barely cracked the top 20 
and before its season had even 
tipped off — sophomore guard 
Jordan Poole was anointed as 
the Wolverines’ star. Redshirt 
junior wing Charles Matthews 
and junior guard Zavier Simpson 
were the leaders, but Poole, 
seven months removed from the 
program’s most iconic moment 
in recent memory, was the face of 
the team.
Then, 
freshman 
forward 
Ignas Brazdeikis stole that title 
and ran with it. When Michigan 
made its introduction to the 
national stage in a 73-46 win at 
Villanova in mid-November, it 
was Brazdeikis — not Poole — 
who shone brightest. Through 
five games, Poole was averaging 
just 7.8 points per game, reaching 
double-digits only once, while 
Brazdeikis had done so four 
times.
Since then, Poole hasn’t had 
a game with under 11 points, 
transitioning from the enigmatic 
scorer he was a year ago to 
the Wolverines’ most reliable 
weapon.
“Coach 
(John 
Beilein) 
is 
definitely giving me the green 
light, but he also trusts me a lot,” 
Poole said on Sunday. “He wants 
to put the ball in my hands, and 
he definitely trusts me on making 
the right play.”
Added 
Beilein: 
“It’s 
the 
complete package of having a 
guy that you gotta trust he’s 
gonna learn what good shots are. 
But you don’t want to take that 
hunting personality he has away 
from him.”
In Michigan’s latest dominant 
win — a 74-63 over Indiana on 
Sunday — that trust was on full 
display.
The first half was a showcase 
of everything Poole offers the 
Wolverines when he’s at his best. 
Five minutes into the game, he 
made back-to-back threes to 
extend Michigan’s early lead to 
eight and blow the roof of the 
Crisler Center, as he did so many 
times off the bench a year ago.

But after the break, he ran into 
the type of adversity that would 
have stymied his effectiveness 
last season. Each of his three 
3-point attempts clanged off 
the rim and into the hands of a 
Hoosier.
Instead of frustratedly jacking 
up more threes, though, Poole 
responded to each of his misses 
by going inside the arc and 
scoring, including a highlight-
reel crossover into a mid-range 
jumper. While his second half 
didn’t have the same pop as his 
first half, all three makes came 
after an Indiana basket as the 
Hoosiers tried to claw back into 
the game.
“We always look at what the 
defense is giving us, and we can 
tell that we were able to pivot 
past some of the mismatches that 
we had in the game today,” Poole 
said. “I feel like we were able to 
drive more in the second half and 
space the floor and get threes in 
the first half.”
Poole’s 
performance 
on 
Sunday was no aberration. In 
last week’s sluggish 68-55 win 
over Penn State, he led all scorers 
with eight points in a low-scoring 
first half. When Brazdeikis and 
Matthews made the headlines 
with 12 points apiece after the 
break, Poole remained consistent, 
with nine of his own. Four 
days earlier, as the Wolverines 
scuffled to a five-point halftime 
lead over Binghamton, it was 
Poole who kept them afloat with 
12 first-half points.
For the kid who had a tendency 
to disappear as a freshman, that 
ability to perform when he and 
his team hit adversity has been 
the biggest difference in Poole’s 
10-game 
double-digit 
point 
streak.
“Over the summer, I saw a 
great growth in what’s important 
in winning basketball,” Beilein 
said. “As opposed to the way 
he probably was playing his 
freshman year.”
And when he and his team are 
on?
Well, then he’s still Jordan 
Poole 
— 
with 
the 
behind-
the-back passes and stepback 
jumpers to prove it.

Michigan falls to Merrimack, 4-2

After 40 minutes of play, 
Michigan (7-8-6) and Merrimack 
(6-15-1) were deadlocked at one 
goal apiece. Forward Derek Petti 
was able to break the stalemate 
with a goal just seconds into the 
third period that allowed the 
Warriors to take the lead and 
eventually the victory, 4-2.
Entering 
the 
final 
period, 
Merrimack was on the power 
play 
as 
a 
result 
of 
senior 
defenseman Nick Boka taking an 
unsportsmanlike conduct penalty 
at the end of the second period. 
And just 17 seconds into the man 
advantage, Petti skated into the 
slot untouched and fired a shot 
past freshman goaltender Strauss 
Mann to put the Warriors up by a 
goal.
“The second goal, we take a bad 
penalty at the end of the period,” 
said Michigan coach Mel Pearson. 
“A real bad penalty, and they 
convert on it. A real soft goal.”
Merrimack added another tally 
moments later to stretch its lead to 
two.
Michigan struck back just over 
two minutes later, when freshman 
defenseman Jack Summers’s shot 
was tipped into the net by junior 
forward Adam Winborg, but the 
late-game goal proved to be not 
enough for the Wolverines. They 
fell to Merrimack, which entered 
the game ranked 52nd in Pairwise 
— out of 60 teams — and have 
now won just one of their last five 
games.
“(The 
Warriors) 
played 
desperate, and that was the 
difference,” Pearson said. “They 
played desperate, they played like 
their life depended on it. We played 
like it was just another game. We’re 
not good enough to just show up 
and think we’re just going to come 
out and play … We’re going to have 
to play a lot harder.”
The matchup was rife with 
odd-man rushes and breakaway 
chances, 
but 
neither 
team 
consistently capitalized on those 
chances.

Just over two minutes into the 
game, forwards Jordan Seyfert and 
Patrick Kramer found themselves 
in a two-on-zero breakaway ahead 
of Michigan’s defense. Mann had 
little hope of stopping Kramer’s 
shot, and Merrimack took the early 
lead.
But after that, the Warriors’ 
odd-man chances frequently found 
the end boards, not the back of the 
net.
Early in the second period, 
freshman 
defenseman 
Nick 
Blankenburg nearly ended up on 
the wrong side of a one-on-zero 
breakaway, but he used his skating 
to force the Merrimack player to 
the side of the net and prevent a 
goal.
For 
Michigan, 
breakaway 
chances were no more fruitful.
“We missed the net a lot,” 
Pearson 
said. 
“(Merrimack) 
blocked a lot of shots, but we missed 
the net a lot. Over the net, wide on 
grade-A 
scoring 
opportunities. 
We’re not a gifted team as far as 
scoring goes. We have to really 
work for our goals and tonight we 
had to really work for our goals.”
Minutes after the Warriors 
found twine, freshman forward 
Garrett van Wyhe and sophomore 
forward Dakota Raabe came close 
to an odd-man rush of their own, 
though goaltender Drew Vogler 
was able to make a straightforward 

save on Van Wyhe’s shot.
It took more than a period 
for the Wolverines to equal the 
score. In the second period, junior 
forward Jake Slaker fired a shot 
from just outside the right circle. 
Goaltender Drew Vogler tried to 
make the save, but Slaker’s shot 
tucked underneath the top of the 
net for his eighth goal of the season.
“(Junior 
defenseman 
Luke 
Martin) made a nice play to me out 
wide,” Slaker said. “I thought I had 
a step on their defenseman. I was 
getting a lot of shots all night and 
I finally saw an opportunity to get 
a good shot and luckily, it went in.”
Just three days before the loss to 
Merrimack, Michigan defeated No. 
9 Notre Dame 4-2 — in South Bend. 
And three days after the loss to 
the Warriors, the Wolverines will 
face No. 4 Ohio State in Columbus. 
Last season, Michigan fell to the 
Buckeyes all five times the two 
teams met. 
The seven teams of the Big Ten 
are separated by just 10 points, 
with three teams tied in the middle 
at 15 points each — including the 
Wolverines.
Michigan now has just three 
days to bounce back from the loss 
and get ready for a trip to Ohio 
State. 
Its performance in Columbus 
could set the course of the rest of 
its season.

One step forward, two steps back

At the final buzzer, Jake 
Slaker could only slam his stick 
down at the ice in frustration, 
shattering it in two.
The junior forward recorded 
six shots on net and a goal in 
the Michigan hockey team’s 
4-2 loss to Merrimack Tuesday 
night. His efforts helped give 
his team a chance to win the 
game. The defense, however, 
lost it.
The play that preceded the 
stick break wasn’t necessarily 
either 
one’s 
fault. 
Who 
could see a game-clinching 
empty-net goal, as freshman 
goaltender 
Strauss 
Mann 
skated away from the post, 
coming? But it was a situation 
the Wolverines should have 
avoided in the first place.
Throughout 
the 
game, 
defensive struggles, ones that 
Michigan coach Mel Pearson 
thought had ceased coming 
out of Saturday’s game at 
Notre 
Dame, 
reappeared. 
Breakaways, 
unmarked 
attackers and easy shots on 
goals — all things that the 
opposing team shouldn’t have 
had. Yet, the Warriors had 
it all. On the flip side, the 
Wolverines had to scrape by for 

every chance they generated, 
and even more so on the ones 
they converted.
“You can’t give up the easy 
goals like that,” Pearson said. 
“Especially when you have to 
struggle so hard to score, like 
we do right now, but you can 
just tell, it’s just a little bit 
intensity. We’re not a gifted 
team as far as scoring goes. 
We have to really work for our 
goals and tonight we had to 
really work for our goals.”
As the team tried to take a 
step forward after its match 
up with the Fighting Irish, the 
defense took two steps back.
The 
play 
that 
best 
exemplified 
this 
happened 
close 
to 
puck 
drop. 
A 
Merrimack skater flipped the 
puck away from the defensive 
zone and into neutral ice. 
It dropped between senior 
defenseman 
Nicholas 
Boka 
and junior defenseman Griffin 
Luce. Neither made the push 
for the puck, and an easy 
possession turned into a sprint 
to stop the breakaway attempt 
for the Warriors.
The 
defensive 
regression 
proved costly minutes after 
when Merrimack scored the 
first goal on a breakaway. 
It all began when freshman 
defenseman Nick Blankenberg 
left his assignment to make an 
on-puck play.
The switch up left Warrior 
Patrick 
Kramer 
open, 
and 
senior 
defenseman 
Joseph 
Cecconi couldn’t rotate in time. 
Merrimack’s Jordan Seyfert, 
who 
broke 
from 
pressure, 
found him, and he scored.
“We just had a defenseman 
leave the middle of the ice and 
come all the way across the ice 
to try and make the play and 
they got a breakaway,” Pearson 
said. “They got a (two-on-one), 
it should’ve been a two-on-four 
the way it was shaping up, but 
because we left an area.
“Never should have done 
that. That’s not a good play. And 
now it gives the momentum. It 

gives them some energy.”
Added Slaker: “Once we 
go down, we know that their 
goal was probably a defensive 
let-down and we were making 
mistakes in the D-zone.”
But Michigan cleaned up. 
With Slaker’s top-shelf goal 
and tightened-up defense, it 
tied the game at one apiece. 
An unnecessary play by Boka, 
however, turned the tides. Boka 
got into a scuffle at the end of 
the second period, committing 
an unsportsmanlike penalty 
in the act and putting the 
Wolverines at a disadvantage 
coming out from the final 
intermission.
“We take a bad penalty at 
the end of the period, a real bad 
penalty, and they convert on it, 
a real soft goal,” Pearson said. 
“We didn’t give them much, 
but we made some key errors 
at critical times, and that cost 
us.”
The special team defense 
had committed too many men 
to the battle near the boards. 
The puck was lodged against 
it, and three of the four skaters 
for Michigan were actively 
trying to poke it away. While 
the Wolverines were pursuing 
the puck, an unmarked Warrior 
skater curled away from the 
battle and stationed himself 
in front of the net. As the puck 
leaked out toward him, there 
was nothing between him and 
the goal besides Mann, and a 
simple shot through Mann’s 
legs created the late deficit.
“Not prepared to play, and 
that’s up to each player to be 
ready to play,” Pearson said 
on Michigan’s performance. 
“Couple comments from our 
team, ‘We didn’t take them 
serious’ or whatever. I don’t 
know how you can because 
we’re not that good. We have to 
take every team serious to have 
a chance to win.
“I thought we made some 
progress at Notre Dame, you 
know, and I thought we took a 
step back tonight.”

 

ATLANTA — Chase Winov-
ich took a deep breath and 
thought. 
Really, truly 
thought.
He had 
been asked by 
a reporter — 
shortly after 
Michigan was 
dismantled by 
Florida, 41-15, 
in the Peach 
Bowl — to 
assess the state of the program.
A fifth-year senior, Winovich 
is often pegged to speak to these 
types of big-picture questions, 
both because he understands 
the program better than just 
about anybody and because Jim 
Harbaugh, the man at the top, 
won’t engage them.
So they get thrown on Win-
ovich. All year. And to his 
credit, less than an hour after 
his college career ended in a 
distasteful crescendo, the de 
facto spokesman obliged. Just 
weeks prior, Winovich chose to 
describe the loss at Ohio State 
as a “mirage” and, well, that 
explanation was no longer on 
the table. Where does that leave 
this program now?
“I caught a lot of flak a couple 
weeks ago because I said ‘We’re 
building a powerhouse.’ I used 
some pretty heavy words,” 
Winovich said, striking an 
uncharacteristically tepid tone. 
“My motivation behind that was 
really trying to get a recruit that 
decommitted to come back. So, 
it worked. I meant what I said, 
just not—we’re building a great 
team. This thing takes time. In 
hindsight, coming to Michi-
gan, I maybe underestimated 
the amount of time and effort 
it would take to get over that 
hump. We’ve been chasing this 
for quite some time.”
Then a sigh.
“We’re close. We’re clawing 
at it.”
Then a question brings Win-
ovich back to the present. The 
Gators posted 427 total yards 
— 257 on the ground — outscor-
ing Michigan 35-5 after the first 
quarter. What surprised him 
about the 26-point loss?
“I’m kinda stoic in the sense 

that a lot of this stuff, especially 
playing as many years as I have, 
kinda stoic in the sense that a lot 
of this stuff is already accounted 
for,” he said. “I’ve already 
accounted in my head that cer-
tain things might happen.”
His response was in the con-
text of what the Gators did on 
the field Dec. 29. But it’s hard 
not to extrapolate that to the 
bigger picture. Chase Winovich 
played at Michigan five years, 
and in that span experienced 
more highs and lows than 
most programs go through in a 
decade.
His first year on campus, 
as a tight end, Michigan went 
5-7 and fired the coach that 
recruited him. Then the Savior 
Of The Program came in and 
turned the place upside down. 
In Harbaugh’s first year, the 
Wolverines won 10 games. The 
next year, inches of JT Barrett’s 
extended arm separated Michi-
gan from a Big Ten title game.
All the while, Winovich 
somehow blossomed into an 
All-Big Ten defensive end. Then, 
slowly but surely, the outward 
face of the team. He came back 
to school unabashedly clear 
about his Big Ten title and Col-
lege Football Playoff goals. 
He coined the now-infamous 
Revenge Tour. 
Which brings us to the Peach 

Bowl — an unceremonious end 
to a one-of-a-kind career, and 
the unequivocal plateau of a 
program seemingly incapable of 

climbing higher.
Just minutes prior, a couple 
hundred feet down the hallway, 
Harbaugh had expounded the 
obvious.
“My feeling about the team 
is we’re right there to the top, 
but we have to put it over the 
top,” the coach who has lost his 
final two games each of the last 
three seasons said. “Especially 
in the big games at the end of 
the year.”
He’s not wrong, of course. 
Michigan under Harbaugh has 
the seventh most wins in that 
span in the country. Prior to his 
arrival, the Wolverines had just 
four seasons with double-digit 
wins since the turn of the cen-
tury. Under Harbaugh, Michi-
gan now has three in the last 
four years.
But after the undressing 
that has been the last month of 
Michigan football, those win 
totals ring hollow. Michigan 
hasn’t won a game later than 
Nov. 19 since the Citrus Bowl 
after the 2015 season. Its signa-
ture win of the last 4 years is … 
Wisconsin in 2016? Penn State 
this year? Bueller?
“Next year, we’re not going to 
try to go backwards,” Winovich 
said, speaking of the program 
he’s now leaving.
While Winovich might be 
correct that regression seems 
unlikely, the Harbaugh era has 
become increasingly defined 
by one question: Is progression 
really any more likely?

Wolverines squeak out win, 79-78

For the second game in a 
row, the Michigan women’s 
basketball team watched as a 
potential game-winning shot 
pinballed around the rim at the 
final buzzer.
This time, the bounce went 
in its favor.
After rallying from an eight-
point fourth-quarter deficit, 
the Wolverines (11-5 overall, 
2-2 Big Ten) clinched a 79-78 
win 
against 
Northwestern 
(9-6, 2-1) in overtime after 
Wildcats 
sophomore 
guard 
Jordan 
Hamilton’s 
shot 
ricocheted off the rim three 
times before harmlessly falling 
into the hands of freshman 
forward Naz Hillmon as the 
buzzer sounded.
 Senior guard Nicole Munger 
hit two free throws with 51.8 
seconds to go to put Michigan 
ahead for good, maintaining 
her 
perfect 
shooting 
percentage from the line.
“It was great to be on the 
winning side,“ said head coach 
Kim Barnes Arico.
The first half was tightly 
contested, with the Wolverines 
trailing, 40-38, at intermission. 
However, scoring woes in the 
first quarter prevented the 
team from entering the locker 
room ahead. Michigan went 
on 
a 
three-minute scoring 
drought, 
and 
found 
itself 
clinging to a slim 16-14 edge at 
the end of the quarter despite 
Northwestern’s 
inability 
to 
make a field goal for three and 
a half minutes.
Down 56-50 entering the 
fourth 
quarter, 
Michigan 
got big plays from Munger, 
Hillmon and senior forward 
Hallie Thome to salvage what 
had been one of the team’s 
sloppier efforts of the season. 
Thome 
opened 
the 
period 
with an open layup, and two 
possessions later saved a loose 
ball from going out of bounds 
to set up a 3-pointer from 
sophomore 
forward 
Hailey 
Brown. Munger added a big 
bucket of her own when she 
knocked down a corner triple 
to cut the Wildcats’ lead to 

63-60.
Hillmon 
outmuscled 
defenders 
off 
her 
missed 
free throw to draw a foul on 
a putback attempt, causing 
Pallas 
Kunaiui-Akpanah 
to 
foul out. A play later, Munger 
found Thome on a gorgeous 
bounce pass inside to cut the 
lead to two. Hillmon knotted 
the score at 67 apiece on the 
next 
possession, 
supplying 
the 
Wolverines 
with 
the 
spark that they had been 
searching for the entire half. 
When discussing her 21-point 
performance, which included 
a whopping seven offensive 
rebounds, Hillmon said that 
her mindset never changed, 
even during some of the game’s 
key moments.
“The entire game I was 
getting putbacks and trying 
to get to the basket, so I tried 
to keep that same mindset so 
that I didn’t worry myself,” 
Hillmon said.
However, 
the 
Wildcats 
responded with three quick 
points to take the lead back. 
After Hillmon split a pair of 
free throws, Michigan was 
whistled for a foul on a loose 
ball, much to the chagrin of 
the crowd. After the Wildcats 
converted on both of their free 
throws, Thome notched a layup 
with 25 seconds left to cut 
the lead to two after Hillmon 
shielded an errant pass from 
being picked off.

Hillmon produced another 
big play on the Wolverines’ 
next 
offensive 
possession. 
Following two missed free 
throws from Northwestern, 
battling inside to secure a 
putback off of her own miss to 
tie the score up at 72. 
“Even if it was a bad pass 
(Hillmon) would come to get 
it,” Brown said. “And even 
if she missed she’d get the 
rebound.”
Michigan forced an airball 
on 
the 
ensuing 
Wildcats 
possession to send the game 
into overtime. After the game, 
Munger noted that the team’s 
defensive 
effort 
down 
the 
stretch was instrumental in 
kickstarting its comeback. 
“If we’re not scoring we 
have to make sure they’re not 
scoring,” she said.
Northwestern 
gained 
the 
edge with a minute to go in 
overtime when it sunk two 
free throws following a foul, 
but 
Munger 
returned 
the 
favor to regain the lead. When 
sophomore guard Deja Church 
was whistled for an offensive 
foul with 12 seconds left, it 
gave the Wildcats one final 
chance to win the game and 
the Wolverines a chance for 
one last stop. After Jordan 
Hamilton’s 
layup 
bounced 
off the rim, Michigan found 
itself basking in the glory of a 
thrilling 79-78 victory.

Bucking the norm

Greg Mattison, Al Washington accept jobs to join Ohio State defensive staff, leaving Harbaugh in the dust

Michigan linebackers coach 
Al Washington will be accepting 
an assistant coaching position 
with Ohio State, according to 
Rivals on Tuesday.
The move comes one day after 
the Wolverines’ defensive line 
coach, Greg Mattison, was named 
the 
Buckeyes’ 
co-defensive 
coordinator, both joining Ryan 
Day, the Buckeyes’ new head 
coach. A Michigan spokesperson 
did not immediately return a 
request for comment.
Washington’s 
loss 
will 
likely be felt the hardest on the 
recruiting trail. At different 
points throughout the season 
Harbaugh 
complimented 
Washington, lumping him in 
with first-year tight ends coach 
Sherrone Moore as staff who 
helped Michigan this season.

“There’s two other coaches 
that don’t get talked about as 
much that are doing a fabulous 
job and that’s Al Washington,” 
Harbaugh said on Nov. 12. “Good 
play out of Khaleke Hudson and 
Josh Uche. His contribution has 
been huge. Just a high-energy 
coach that does a great job with 
recruiting. The other is (tight 
ends coach) Sherrone Moore 
who has done a fabulous job with 
the tight ends. 
“… Just really wanted to 
mention those two coaches in 
particular because you don’t 
hear people talking about them 
that much.”
Washington 
grew 
up 
an 
Ohio State fan, due to his father 
playing 
linebacker 
for 
the 
Buckeyes. He mentioned that he 
heard stories of Ohio State coach 
Woody Hayes and his legendary 
battles with Wolverines coach 
Bo Schembechler growing up. 

At one point, Washington said he 
wanted to play for Ohio State as 
a kid.
He 
didn’t, 
attending 
Boston College instead, and 
Washington’s full conversion 
from Buckeyes fan to Michigan 
coach seemed to be complete. 
Washington was the Wolverines’ 
lead recruiter on players like 
Zach Harrison, attempting to 
convince them that Ann Arbor 
was a better home for them than 
Columbus.
Now, it seems that conversion 
was 
only 
temporary, 
as 
Washington is headed back to 
the place he heard about growing 
up.
Michigan and Ohio State will 
face off Nov. 30 next season.
Despite some staff turnover 
in Columbus, it seems there 
will be more familiar faces on 
the Buckeyes’ sideline than 
previously thought.

ALEXIS RANKIN/Daily
Al Washington, one of Michigan’s best recruiters in the state of Ohio, joined the Buckeyes’ coaching staff Tuesday.

A turbulent offseason for 
Michigan football has now 
gone from bad to worse.
Michigan 
defensive 
line 
coach 
Greg 
Mattison 
has 
accepted a job to join the staff at 
Ohio State, as first reported by 
Wolverines Wire on Monday. 
A spokesperson for the team 
did not immediately respond 
for comment. Mattison is set 
to replace Greg Schiano as the 
defensive coordinator of the 
Buckeyes, per multiple reports.
Mattison 
spent 
eight 
seasons on staff at Michigan, 
regularly 
grooming 
a 
top-
tier defensive line. With the 
Wolverines, Mattison coached 
five defensive linemen to first- 
or second-team all-Big Ten 
selections — Taco Charlton, 
Rashan 
Gary, 
Maurice 

Hurst, Chase Winovich and 
Chris Wormley. During his 
tenure, the defensive line was 
frequently the hallmark of the 
team.
This is the culmination of 
Mattison’s second stint with 
the program, joining from the 
Baltimore Ravens in 2010. He 
also coached for the team from 
1992-1996.
Mattison’s departure would 
undoubtedly sting regardless, 
though 
the 
loss 
is 
only 
enhanced by his destination. 
The Buckeyes have beaten 
Michigan 14 of the last 15 
seasons and have yet to lose to 
a Jim Harbaugh-coached team. 
Mattison will join the staff of 
new Ohio State coach Ryan 
Day, who takes over for the 
now-retired Urban Meyer.
The Mattison news comes 
just over a week after the 
Wolverines were embarrassed 

in their bowl game, falling 
41-15 to Florida in the Peach 
Bowl, capping the 10-3 season 
in a dour manner. In the 
interim, several high-profile 
players declared early for the 
NFL draft: Gary, linebacker 
Devin Bush, cornerback David 
Long and tight end Zach 
Gentry. 
Each 
offseason 
under 
Harbaugh 
has 
included 
turnover 
on 
the 
coaching 
staff, with Ed Warriner, Al 
Washington 
and 
Sherrone 
Moore joining the staff last 
year. The Mattison departure 
is the first such move of 2019, 
but did not prove to be the last. 
Tuesday, linebackers coach Al 
Washington joined Mattison in 
Columbus.
And 
for 
Harbaugh 
and 
Michigan, an offseason already 
sure to be rife with questions 
just reached a fever pitch.

SportsWednesday Column: Mending the gap

A

h, the college football 
offseason.
A time for those of us 
in Ann Arbor 
to turn our 
collective 
attention to 
John Beilein 
and the 
undefeated 
Michigan 
basketball 
team. After 
the way the 
Wolverines’ 
football team 
finished its season, you can’t 
blame people for being eager to 
do just that.
And yet, Monday, nine days 
after Michigan’s season ended 
in a 26-point loss to Florida in 
the Peach Bowl, my attention 
drifted back to the football 
team for a bit.
That was probably inevitable, 
since college football was rath-
er unavoidable Monday. In case 
you didn’t hear, Clemson beat 
the hell out of Alabama in the 
national championship game 
after beating the hell out of 
Notre Dame in the semifinals.
The transitive property is 
tempting to bring up here as 
someone who follows the Wol-
verines, but it is a dumb metric, 
and in this case, it doesn’t really 
matter. That’s because there are 
two programs seemingly light 
years ahead of the others in the 
country, and they played on 
Monday night.
There are 
programs, like 
Georgia, per-
haps, or maybe 
even Oklahoma 
and Ohio State, 
that can claim to 
be within arm’s 
reach of the 
Tigers and the 
Crimson Tide.
And then 
there are pro-
grams like 
Michigan, which is waiting 
near the front of the line to 
join the elite programs club, 
while the bouncer is letting the 

important people skip the line.
That is fine, in the grand 
scheme of things. By that, I 
mean that things could be 
much, much worse. Ask about 
110 other programs in the coun-
try. Hell, ask the Gators, who 
are playing third-fiddle in their 
conference these days.
But it brings a question to 
mind: How do the Wolverines 
get to the level of Clemson and 
Alabama?
It certainly isn’t through 
what was Michigan’s biggest 
news Monday, which came 
when defensive line coach Greg 
Mattison departed to become 
co-defensive coordinator for 
the Buckeyes — the Wolverines’ 
biggest rival.
On Tuesday, it was 
announced linebackers coach 
Al Washington would join Mat-
tison in Columbus.
These are just the most 
recent Michigan losses to the 
Ohio State in a long string of 
them. The Buckeyes have beat-
en the Wolverines seven times 
in a row and in 14 of the last 15 
meetings.
With seven of those 14 losses, 
Michigan has finished in sec-
ond place in the Big Ten or its 
division. That includes this 
season and 2016 — both years 
when a win over Ohio State 
would have likely pushed the 
Wolverines into the College 
Football Playoff.
Win even a few of those 
games and we aren’t talking 
about the dis-
appointment 
Michigan con-
tinually faces.
And this is 
where Mattison 
and Washing-
ton’s departures 
really hurt. 
Because if there 
was ever a time 
that the Buck-
eyes were vul-
nerable, it would 
be now.
Urban Meyer, a deeply flawed 
man but one of the best coaches 
in college football history, just 

retired. His replacement, Ryan 
Day, is a relatively unknown 
upstart. Yes, he helped orches-
trate the offensive dominance 
Ohio State displayed in its 62-39 
win over the Wolverines this 
season, but it stands to reason 
Day will need some time to fig-
ure everything out.
Or maybe it stood to rea-
son. Since Day 
took over, he has 
won a recruiting 
battle for five-star 
defensive end Zach 
Harrison, who was 
once predicted to 
go to Michigan. 
Then, Day secured 
the transfer of 
Georgia quarter-
back Justin Fields, 
the former No. 1 
prospect in the 
2018 recruiting class. And now, 
Day has hired away two of the 
Wolverines’ best recruiters.
To be fair, staff turnover isn’t 

uncommon with top programs. 
Alabama has had an enormous 
amount of it and has been at 
the top of the heap in college 
football for much of the last 10 
seasons. Of course, the Crimson 
Tide’s turnover often comes 
after a national champion-
ship, whereas the Wolverines’ 
typically comes after a crushing 
loss to Ohio 
State and then 
another defeat 
in whatever 
bowl game 
follows.
This is 
also differ-
ent, because 
Alabama 
doesn’t lose 
its coaches to 
Auburn, and it 
often has the 
talent to make up for any coach-
ing losses.
So Michigan has some 
ground to make up. By some, I 

mean a lot. The way to do it is 
through elite recruiting or elite 
game-planning. Often the two 
go hand in hand.
The Wolverines brought in 
a top-10 recruiting class this 
season, the third in the last four 
seasons under coach Jim Har-
baugh. That is better than most 
teams. It is tied with Ohio State. 
It is not better than Alabama or 
Georgia.
In terms of gameplanning or 
coaching, Michigan has it bet-
ter than nearly every team it 
plays. It does not have it better 
than the Buckeyes. I give you 
the aforementioned 62-39 as 
proof.
That is the kind of loss, a 
23-point blowout to your big-
gest rival, that hampers recruit-
ing and makes it feasible for an 
assistant coach to think about 
jumping ship to said rival. 
And it is also the exact, annu-
al loss that is holding Michigan 
back.

What the Wolverines have 
right now is good enough to 
finish second in the Big Ten 
East every year, remain a top 
10 program in the nation and 
then watch the real big boys in 
college football play for cham-
pionships.
Ask anybody within the pro-
gram if that’s good enough, and 
they will say it isn’t.
What has to change is some-
thing systemic. There either 
has to be a greater buy-in 
within the program to elevate 
players to a new level, a change 
in philosophy to use players’ 
talents more effectively or an 
uptick in recruiting that injects 
Michigan with players too good 
to fail.
That is what separates the 
Wolverines from the top. From 
the Buckeyes, even.
Whether or not Michigan 
is willing and able to make 
the necessary improvements 
remains to be seen.

If the 
Buckeyes were 
vulnerable, it 
would be now.
