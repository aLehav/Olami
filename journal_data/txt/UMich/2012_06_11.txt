UHS to use
electronic
records
Director says
transition to new
system may be rocky
By JACOB AXELRAD
Editor in Chief
Beginning June 13, Univer-
sity Health Services will convert
health records to an electronic
system - a change that UHS
Director Robert Winfield says
coincides with the recent elimina-
tion of walk-in appointments.
On May 13, UHS made the
switch to appointment-only after
assessing data from surveys that
examined patient satisfaction
with health services.
In fall 2011, 88 percent of the
1,591 patients surveyed said they
were satisfied with the overall
quality of care and customer ser-
vice at UHS, which decreased
from the 91 percent satisfaction
rate in fall 2010, according to UHS
satisfaction survey data.
The same survey expressed a
72-percent satisfaction rate with
the overall waiting experience in
fall 2011, as opposed to 82 percent
in winter of that same year.
On average, between winter and
fall of 2011, while patient satisfac-
tion remained at 86 percent for
appointment services, satisfaction
dropped from 80 to 62 percent for
walk-in services.
In an interview with The Michi-
gan Daily, Winfield said this is well

American flags, bright balloons
and nuns filled the Diag on Friday,
withstanding the summer heat
to protest a mandate given by the
U.S. Department of Health and

Human Services.
The mandate would require
employers who provide health
care coverage to also include con-
traception and sterilization.
About 500 people, including
families, religious leaders and
students attended the two-hour
rally, many carryingasigns.
NickThomm, the co-founderof
Stop HHS - a project petitioning
against the mandate, which co-
sponsored the event - spoke to
the crowd at the event.
In an interview with The
Michigan Daily after the event,
Thomm said the rally was per-

tinent to all Americans who do
not want their freedoms to be
impinged upon.
"This isn't a Catholic issue, this
isn't a Christian issue," Thomm
said. "One of the points I made
in my talk is that when especially
First Amendment liberties are
going down a slippery slope, we
don't know what's going to be
next."
He added that this was the sec-
ond rally held in Ann Arbor this
year, the first of which was held at
the Ann Arbor Federal Building.

FILM R EVIEW
Antciptedprequel not eXceptional

Officials concerned
with potential for
students getting
help from 'U'
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
ManagingEditor
After years of debate and strug-
gle, Michigan House Bill 4393
went into full effect on June 1, cre-
ating a statewide medical amnesty
policy that prevents people under
the age of 21 from receiving Minor
in Possessionof alcohol citations if
they seek medical attention.
Medical amnesty has been part
of the buzz on campus recently,
with the' Central Student Gov-
ernment assembly passing two
resolutions in support of medical
amnesty earlier this year.
Diane Brown, spokeswoman
for the University's Department
of Public Safety, said DPS is com-
plying with the new law as with
any change to state law.
"Any time laws change, which
is not infrequently, we always
have refreshers or updates," she
said.
Brown added that medical
amnesty has not yet been invoked
and DPS does not expect it to be
invoked often duringthe summer.
Brown said she thinks stu-

dents have already been making
conscientious decisions concern-
ing drinking prior to the medical
amnesty bill.
"We believe that our University
students are already very smart,
and so they would have already
been calling to get help for a
friend," Brown said.
Mary Jo Desprez, administra-
tor of the Alcohol and Other Drug
Policy and Prevention Program,
said there is not much institu-
tional change that the University
needs to make, but students will
be informed of changes to the
law.
"For the last few years, we
(required) all incoming first-year
students and incoming transfer
students to take an online course
before they get to campus and in
that course ... you can put a link to
the law," Desprez said.
An explanation of medical
amnesty will also be included
in the Alcohol and Other Drugs
Policy, which gets distributed to
members of faculty, staff and stu-
dents every year.
"We certainly want students
to know that every barrier has
been removed for them to call if
they're concerned about a friend,"
Desprez said. "I think that's what
everyone hopes that the law will
do."
Desprez added that the law
could prevent students from get-

ting the help they may need from
the University.
"One unintended consequence
is that we lose the ability to touch
base with somebody who's had
an alcohol transport," Desprez
said. "That ticket usually gener-
ated ... an educational response,
which allowed us to connect
with that student and just find
out how alcohol has shown up in
their life."
LSA senior Sebastian Swae-
Shampine, assistant execu-
tive director of the University's
chapter of Students for Sensible
Drug Policy, said SSDP isn't cur-
rently concerned with promoting
knowledge of medical amnesty.
"We're not really trying to press
or advance the policy towards
students yet. That's the sort of
process that will be happening
moving into the next academic
year," Swae-Shampine said.
He added that SSDP has instead
been meeting with members of
the University's administration
to facilitate the implementation of
the new law.
In particular, Swae-Shampine
echoed the sentiments expressed
by Desprez that there is apossibili-
ty that the University could lose its
ability to contact students in risky,
alcohol-related situations.
"There's been a little bit of
resistance towards DPS just giv-
ing students free passes, which is

absolutelynot the case ofhow this
law is supposed to be implement-
ed," Swae-Shampine said.
He added that dialogue within
University administration is nec-
essary for the law to succeed.
"I think the biggest thing is ...
getting DPS and AOD - in one
level or another -connected with
each other, such that ifa student
presents him- or herself as a result
of over-consumption of alcohol,
they are having that important
conversation with a counselor,"
Swae-Shampine said.
In addition to protecting stu-
dents who have dangerously
consumed alcohol, the law also
protects people under the age of
21 who are afraid of being sexual-
ly assaulted but have been drink-
ing, Swae-Shampine noted.
"It protects minors who con-
sume alcohol or are in possession
of alcohol who feel like they're
under sexual assault or duress,
which I think is pretty ground-
breaking." Swae-Shampine said.
After years of watching
attempts to puta medical amnes-
ty policy in place at the University
and across the state but failing
to do so, Swae-Shampine said he
feels relieved.
"This is a fight that's been hap-
pening for years," Swae-Shamp-
ine said. "So it's just kind of like a
cathartic moment of release. Yes,
finallythis happens."

and jet off to this mysterious solar
system. Along for the ride are David
(Michael Fassbender, "Shame") the
sociopathic android and a team of
mysteriously sourced "scientific
experts." No icky parasites to be
seen.
Visually though, similarities are
apparent almost immediately. A
few beautifully shot wide angles
are more reminiscent of the newer
Ridley Scott vehicles such as "King-
dom of Heaven," and capture some
incredible natural landscapes, but
the majority of the film occurs in an
abandoned cave complex, mysteri-
ous, dimly lit and as claustrophobic
as "Alien." The action of the two
movies is structured almost identi-
cally, butScott uses this predictabil-
ity to his film's advantage, lulling

audiences into a false sense of secu-
rity, until small, sudden departures
from what's expected scare you out
of your seat. We've seen a lot of this
before - the flamethrowers and the
spacesuits, the mysterious aliens
and the jars full of canned death -
but somehow all of it feels fresh, dif-
ferent and scary as hell.
The fact that the film manages
to instill jaw-dropping, nerve-
wracking tension into its viewers
shows that even in old age, Ridley's
still got it. What makes this a par-
ticularly proud accomplishment for
Hollywood's sage elder is the film's
hackneyed script, some of the most
atrocious screenwriting to ever
enter production. Written in large
part by Damon Lindelof (the guy
who ruined the "Lost" finale), the
stench of its flaws permeates the
entire film. Dialogue between char-
acters is often stilted. The char-
acters themselves are irrationally
motivated and completely unbeliev-

able (in a lot of cases, unbelievably,
hilariously dumb). Nitpickers, and
anybody else in the audience with
a healthy attention span and func-
tioning memory, will note the mul-
titude of plot holes and feel mildly
insulted by the film's conclusion,
which attempts to tie up all the loose
ends through a broad voiceover
tease to a potential sequel.
Even there, it's not quite a total
loss. Fassbender, as per usual,
turns in a fascinating perfor-
mance, battling through a few
crudely placed one-liners and
crafting a character that seems
not just inscrutable, or erratic,
but truly soulless. Rapace, to her
credit, does strong-willed and
stubborn almost as well as her pre-
decessor, Sigourney Weaver. Their
performances, and the film's tech-
nical execution, make it an enjoy-
able experience and slightly more
than another waste of money, even
if you do see it in 3-D.

"It's a great opportunity to cele-

"For example, last night at dress
rehearsal, we had a deer just walk
through a scene," Mendeloff said.
"The characters were pretending
to have horns and to be deer and
there was a real deer and you know
that's just an opportunity you don't
get often - these sort of serendipi-

very special."
However, a living backdrop
is a constant surprise, running a

heightened risk of disruptions, like
the occasional erroneous jogger or

Burks - who plays one of this year's
Mistress Page's - attested, nature
isn't always welcoming.
"Yes, we tend to deal with some
poison ivy issues and the occa-
sional falling down in the dirt, but
it's pretty non-hazardous," Burks
said.
There's also the unique place-
ment of the audience. Instead of a
sea of faces diluted by the shining
stage lights, the actors performing
are confronted with an audience
whose reactions can be clearly

seen and interpreted.
"You can see everyone's excited
expressions, from smiles to people
looking down at their phones and
texting, so it's different," Burks
said.
Even so, the picturesque back-
drop always outclasses the minor
inconveniences.
"I think that I'm spoiled now,"
Mendeloff said. "When I watch a
production of a Shakespeare play
like 'Midsummer', or 'As You Like
It' or a play that isset in nature and
I see it ... on a stage, I always feel
really sorry for them. There's just
nothing like the real thing."

the state of Michigan held simi-
lar rallies on Friday, according to
Thomm.
He said these rallies were in
reaction to the Obama administra-
tion's unwillingness to compro-
mise.
"We have a significant threat
to our religious liberty," Thomm
said. "There has been an inflex-
ibility on the part of the Obama
administration to even hold dia-
logue with the U.S. bishops or
other faith groups."
According to their website, Stop
HHS is a project of Ave Maria Radio
- a Catholic radio station - that is
"committed to reversing the deci-
sion of the Obama Administration
to force Catholic organizations to
provide sterilization, contracep-
tion, and abortifacient drugs in
their health care plans."
LSA junior Joe Lipa, vice presi-
dent of Students for Life, reserved
space on the Diag for the rally on
behalf of his organization, which
was a co-sponsor of the event.
"It's tough always in the sum-
mer, where everyone scatters and
goes home, because maybe 5 per-
cent of students are taking spring
classes," Lipa said.
However, Lipa said he saw a
large amount of young people he
recognized in the crowd.

Though Students for Life's con-
stitution deems itself "non-sectar-
ian," Lipa said the group's beliefs
are aligned with those fighting for
religious freedom.
"Pro-life and religious freedom
are not contradicting in any way,
especially when the violation of
religious freedom requires the
providing of abortions," Lipa said.
"That directly impacts our club."
Considering that the HHS man-
date would require hospitals to
provide abortions, Lipa said any
member of Students for Life is also
a supporter of religious freedom.
LSA senior Carmen Allen, for-
mer president of Students for
Life, attended the rally and said
it reflects the open nature of dia-
logue in America.
"The beauty of the United
States is that when the govern-
ment does something that the
people aren't OK with, the people
have the power to make a change
to make an influence in that gov-
ernment," she said. "I think (the
rally) is a testament to that, and I
want to be part of it."
Rackham student Kevin Dahl-
berg also attended the event and
said it follows in the rich history
the University has of social activ-
ism.
"I think the University of Mich-
igan ... has a wonderful tradition of
protests, of standing up for what
is right, for what is reasonable,"
Dahlberg said.

I IR MKO/A

Ray Bradbury dies at age 91.
something is lost in this transition.
Tablets are not a pure book-reading
experience. Can anyone get the
same experience reading a book on
an iPad where distractions thrive?
Our generation of television
watchers and internet surfers may
be just as dangerous to printed
books as the firefighters who burn
books in "Fahrenheit 451" are.
Critics, teachers, readers all like
to believe the novel is a warning
against the censorship of books
but Bradbury spent the last few
years of his life trying to convince
everyone "Fahrenheit 451" wasn't
about censorship. Rather, he was
adamant the novel was a caution-
ary tale against the potential evil
of television, or "quicker" ways
of getting information. Bradbury
worried about a society where
people gave up books because they
had easier, faster forms of enter-
tainment and knowledge.
An LA Weekly article by Amy
E. Boyle Johnston from 2007, the
year Bradbury received a Pulitzer
award, elaborated on Bradbury's
fears and highlighted Bradbury's
insistence the book wasn't-about
censorship.
"Unlike Orwell's 1984, in which
the government uses television
screens to indoctrinate citizens,
Bradbury envisioned television as
an opiate," Johnston says.
Johnston's article notes that

Bradbury feared that formats like
television took people away from
enjoying literature.
"Useless ... they stuff you with
so much useless information, you
feel full," Bradbury said of televi-
sion.
Johnston includes an excerpt
from a letter Bradbury sent to
another writer, Richard Matheson,
in 1951 about how he feared radio
would take away from literature.
"Radio has contributed to our
growing lack of attention ... This
sort of hopscotching existence
makes it almost impossible for
people, myself included, to sit down
and get into a novel again. We have
become a short story reading peo-
ple, or, worse than that, a QUICK
reading people," Bradbury wrote.
Bradbury's fears about radio
and television could just as eas-
ily extend to the' internet and
technology. People like to utter
the phrase "this is so 1984" when
they feel the society they live in
is becoming like the one George
Orwell depicted in "1984," but
when I read about the end of Ray
Bradbury's life in a mere two-sen-
tence status update on Facebook, I
couldn't help but think "this is so
Farenheit 451."
And there is my favorite passage
from the book - where the main
character and another firefighter
discuss why they don't need books:

Cram them full of non-
combustible data, chock them so
damned full of 'facts' they feel
stuffed, but absolutely 'brilliant'
with information. Then they'll
feel they're thinking, they'll get
a sense of motion without mov-
ing. And they'll be happy, because
facts of that sort don't change.
Don't give them any slippery stuff
like philosophy or sociology to tie
things up with. That way lies mel-
ancholy. Any man who can take
a TV wall apart and put it back
together again, and most men
can nowadays, is happier than
any man who tries to slide-rule,
measure, and equate the universe,
which just won't be measured
or equated without making man
feel bestial and lonely ... I just like
solid entertainment."
So much of Bradbury's book
seems tobe coming true. We aren't
burning books yet, but it doesn't
seem like it will take long for them
to seem more useful as kindling
for the camp fire than something
to crack open.
Bradbury will be remembered
because he left us with so many
burning questions: "Who will
need books when we have kindles
and iPads? Who will need litera-°
ture when we have movies, video
games and the internet? Who will
need truth when we have enter-
tainment?"

below UHS's target satisfaction
rate.
"Our goal is above 90 (per-
cent)," Winfield said. "We don't
want one out of seven people say-
ing this sucked. We could live
with one out of 10 or one out of 12,
but our goal is higher than that."
Other universities have already
started the trend eliminating
walk-ins, including Michigan
State University, which transi-
tioned away from a walk-in-only
system 15 years ago when it wasn't
uncommon for students to wait
over an hour for service during
flu season in particular, accord-
ing to Kathi Braunlich, marketing
and communications manager for
Michigan State University Stu-
dent Health Services.
Braunlich said MSU uses a
hybrid system where walk-in ser-
vices aren't advertised, but time
is set aside every day to facilitate
students' immediate needs:
"We try to start the (begin-
ning) of each day with at least
70 percent of our appointments
open," Braunlich said. "We don't
advertise it as being a walk-in
clinic ... we want people to call
ahead of time."
Braunlich added that forc-
ing students to schedule their
appointments while still leav-
ing time throughout the day for
students to be seen as needed
shortens average wait time for
students at.the clinic.
When asked if UHS ever con-
sidered a hybrid system similar.
to MSU's, Winfield said while the

option was discussed, it seemed
"too confusing" after looking at
the extensive data as well as tak-
ing habits of students into consid-
eration.
"The message is complicated,"
Winfield said. "We've also got a
lot of experience with the student
life pattern, and we have to be
respectful of that."
Winfield also said part of the
reason for the change to appoint-
ment-only is that Epic - the new
software UHS is implementing
that UHS will refer to as MiChart
- is difficult to use.
"We don't know how to use
(the software), and I think it's
going to slow us down," Winfield
said.
However, instantaneous com-
munication between UHS and
the University's medical center
once they get used to the pro-
gram is just one of the advantages
it will bring to patient treatment,
Winfield said.
"Anything we do is going to
be visible at the medical center,"
Winfield said. "If I see you and
you have abdominal pain, and we
do a blood count and an x-ray, and
I tell you, if you get worse, (to) go
to the emergency room ... they'll
have all of our results, right there,
at their fingertips."
Winfield estimated that it will
take the staff six months to a
year to get back to their standard
operating speed based on consul-
tation with other clinical settings
with the same software.
"We are planning to give clini-
cal staff double time for visits for
6 weeks, and then reassess," Win-
field wrote in an e-mail.
Winfield explained that this

is a $170 million project that will
affect about 200 clinics in the
University medical center. As a
result, during the UHS staff's
transition, patients should expect
to wait longer for treatment.
"This is really, really compli-
cated, and we're a pretty simple
place," Winfield said. "For the
first few weeks, every visit's
going to get 30 minutes so we can
learn how to do this."
But he added that after the
staff has gained familiarity with
the software, UHS might rethink
its current position on walk-in
appointments.
"I'll consider anythingto make
service work. I am not one of
those people who sticks to some-
thing that isn't working," Win-
field said.
In August, UHS will introduce
the "patient portal," allowing
patients to access their medical
records online with a personal
sign-in code.
The reason certain changes
have already been put in place
was to avoid a major backlog of
patients once students return
for the school year, according
to Kathleen Miller, operations
manager of the UHS Clinic and
a member of the lead team for
MiChart implementation.
"We're hoping that with
going live in June, people should
become pretty proficient by
August," Miller said.

Tuition tyranny
Public university funding has too many stipulations
As universities across the U.S. feel the increasingly constrictive
demands of the economic hardships plaguing this decade, so too
does the University of Michigan. With the University's pockets
already tightened by a 15 percent cut in higher education funding from
the state government this past year, the Michigan legislature now seeks
to offset some of these costs with a 3 percent increase in funding. This
minimal increase comes with a stringent set of stipulations that Michi-
gan public universities need to abide by in order to receive the funding.
As the 2013 Education Omnibus Appropriation Bill deeply threatens
universities' autonomy in making crucial financial decisions, Republi-
can Gov. Rick Snyder should not sign it into law.

With 400 meters to go, fifth-
year senior Craig Forys was sitting
in fourth place in the men's 3,000-
meter steeplechase at the NCAA
Outdoor Championships in Des
Moines, Iowa on Saturday, look-
ing to pass Ohio State's Cory Leslie
down the homestretch for third
place. Princeton's Donn Cabral and
Texas A&M's Henry Lelei were
strides ahead of the chase pack, so
they had to fight it out for third.
But Lelei tripped over the final
barrier and Forys out-kicked Leslie
to claim second place in his final
race in a Michigan jersey.
Cabral won the national title in a
time of 8:35.44 with Forys just five
secondsbehind, finishingin 8:40.66.
"It felt awesome crossing the
line," Forys said. "I was a little bit
down and out with a few laps to go
so I felt really lucky to pass a few
there and finish behind Donn."
The race began slower than

usual, with a tight pack running a
relaxed race.
"The first time anything really
of value happened was with 1,000
meters to go," Forys said. "Donn
Cabral went to the front of the pack
and set the pace. He and Henry
Lelei basically separated right away
from a few of us. I was stuck behind
with a couple of guys doing a chase
pack together."
Not keeping pace with Cabral
proved a smart move for Forys, as
he ended up having enough left to
out-kick the other runners in the
peloton.
In addition to winning the 3,000-
meter steeplechase in the Big Ten
Outdoor Championships, Forys
ends his career as a first-team All-
American runner - his second All-
American honor.
"(My career) was pretty wild
looking back," Forys said. "There
was a while there where it didn't
look like I would do anything with
my career at Michigan. It's great to
turn it around in the past couple of

years and graduate with a few acco-
lades to my name.
"It was a roller coaster ride. Lots
of ups and downs and you never
know what's going to come around
the next corner. There's nothing
else to do but show up to practice."
ARATSU, 4x400 OUT EARLY:
In track, every second counts. And
in the case of sophomore Ali Aratsu,
five hundreths of a second counts,
too.
Aratsu was beaten by Ohio State's
Antonio Blanks in Wednesday's
semifinals of the 400-meter hur-
dles. Blanks edged Aratsu by 0.05
seconds to clinch the last spot in
the finals, but Aratsu's performance
earned him second-team All-Amer-
ican accolades.
The Wolverines' 4x400-meter
relay also competed in Des Moines,
placing 19th in a time of 3:07.03.
Nick Neuman, Aaron Taylor, Mat-
thew Campbell and Philip Wash-
ington each earned All-American
Honorable Mention for their perfor-
mances.

M' competitors garner All-American honors

The 2013 Education Omnibus
Appropriation Bill calls for a 3 per-
cent increase in higher education
spending, as long as strict stipula-
tions are adhered to. Higher edu-
cation spending dropped by more
than 19 percent between 2007 and
2012 and hasn't seen an increase
in funding in over four years. The
conditions to receive this money
include limiting tuition increas-
es to 4 percent or less, as well
as intruding upon the universi-
ties' social policies like requiring
extra reports detailing stem-cell
research. Under this bill, institu-
tions aren't allowed to have a rela-
tionship with nonprofit "worker
centers" that protest working con-
ditions in Michigan businesses,
amongother constraints.
The bill's meager allocation of
additional funding to higher edu-
cation shouldn't demand further

compromises by any universities.
A 3 percent increase does little
to stop the bleeding created by
the past few years of budget cuts.
Institutions, especially our own,
have been forced to raise tuition
by as much as 7.1 percent in this
past year. The requirements
of this bill simply aren't worth
adhering to when only a small
slice of the 3 percent increase is
all that a university receives.
Higher education funding
shouldn't come with constraints
pertaining to social issues in the
first place. Whether or not the
state government agrees with a
university's politics, university
funding must be non-partisan, as
Michigan universities have con-
stitutionally guaranteed autono-
my in making financial decisions.
University leaders have the right
to run their institution in the way

they believe best serves their stu-
dents without politicians in Lan-
sing breathing down their necks.
The stipulation that univer-
sities must limit their tuition
increase to 4 percent or less is
unreasonable. The University
will only receive a 1.6 percent
increase in their funding through
this bill. The gap between cuts
and increases in higher education
funding is still insufficiently met,
even with the 7.1 percent tuition
hike from last year and a 4 per-
cent increase this year, should the
University decide to comply.
The Michigan Legislature only
succeeds in tying the hands of
University leaders with this bill.
Snyder has always claimed to
supportthe state ofaMichigan's
university system and higher
education. It's time for him to put
the money where his mouth is.

Despite not having a competitor
place in any event, the three com-
petitors for Michigan women's
track and field team brought home
impressive accolades.
Jillian Smith, Kiley Tobel
and Emily Pendleton all earned
second-team All-American hon-
ors for their performances at the
NCAA Outdoor Championships in
Des Moines, Iowa.
Smith, who made her first
appearance in the NCAA Outdoor
Championships, finished 13th in
the 1,500-meter race on Thursday.
She was edged by Notre Dame's
Rebecca Tracy for the final quali-
fying spot in the finals by 0.1 sec-
onds, finishing in 4:13.59.
"I just didn't catch her in the
end," Smith said. "We were all
trying to get (out) as fast as we
could and I could've gone a little
bit faster earlier (in the race). (But
my time) was definitely one of
the fastest non-qualifying times,
which is something to be proud of
anyways."
The race got out quickly from
the start, forcing Smith to settle

in the middle of the pack and play
catch-up for most of the race.
"It was a very honest race the
whole time," she said. "It was very,
very physical in the very begin-
ning ... there were definitely a lot
of elbows thrown. I tried my best,
but somehow I just caught the
back, so I was definitely working
the whole time to get back up."
After struggling with stom-
ach issues at the beginning of the
season, Smith said she was "sur-
prised" with how her body recov-
ered and how her year played out.
"It was the first time I made it
to outdoor NCAAs," she said. "It
was really exciting for me to even
get to this point.
"I definitely think that (I can)
just take that race in stride and
think about next time I'm racing.
I was pretty far in the back for a
while, so I definitely think I'm
going to work on technically when
to move. And races of that caliber,
you learn how to approach them."
Smith was the only Wolverine
running in an event, as Michigan
had two competitors in the field
events.
Tobel and Pendleton wrapped
up their seasons on the first day

of competition, competing in the
pole vault and discus, respective-
ly- Tobel placed 10th in the pole
vault, recordinga height of 13-7.25
feet, just one foot under the win-
ner from Stanford, who set thew
NCAA meet record.
She failed, though, to clear
the bar at 13-9.25 feet in all three
attempts.
The redshirt sophomore, who
set the Michigan program record

earlier in the season, earned sec-
ond-team All-American accolades
for her performance on Wednes-
day.
And in her final outing as a Wol-
verine, fifth-year senior thrower
Emily Pendleton finished 12th in
the discus with a throw of 173-2
feet. She, too, garnered 'second-
team All-American honors for her
performance in Des Moines.
Since so few Michigan athletes

competed in the meet, Smith said
the athletes bonded at the event.
"I've never notbeenwith anoth-
er running teammate so it was
cool to see how (Tobel and Pend-
leton) approach getting ready for
the National Championships, and
seeing each other and supporting
each other," Smith said. "It was
nice to see everybody compete. I
think we each helped each other
manage the stress a little bit."

Athletes earn Big Ten brass

Hoke talks recruiting,
possible BCS changes

By COLLEEN THOMAS
Daily Sports Editor
On Thursday, two Michigan ath-
letes were awarded one of the most
prestigious conference awards.
Softball senior Amanda
Chidester and men's swimming
senior Dan Madwed were honored
with the Big Ten's Medal of Honor
as one of 24 conference athletes that
"attained the greatest proficiency in
athletics and scholastic work."
Chidester led the Wolverines to
its fifth consecutive Big Ten softball
title this year in addition to a NCAA
Regional championship. The Allen
Park, Mich. native was also named
the Big Ten Player of the Year for
the second consecutive season.

Madwed helped the Michigan
men's swimming and diving team
to the Big Ten title this season. The
senior collected Big Ten's Swim-
mer of the Year and Swimmer of the
Championship honors after win-
ning four conference titles in 2012.
The award, which started in
1915, was originally intended for
one graduating student-athlete
from each university but has since
expanded. According to the general
release from the Big Ten, "The Big
Ten Medal of Honor was the first
award in intercollegiate athletics to
demonstrate support for the educa-
tional emphasis placed on athletics.
It was acclaimed throughout the
nation 'as one of the significantges-
tures yet made in college sports."'

Michigan coach Brady Hoke's
job would be so much easier if he
could waltz right into an Ohio high
school, sweep up all the five-star
recruits and call it a day.
But unfortunately for Hoke, it's
a lot harder than that.
"You can take all the 'stars' and
all the ways the guys are rated and
that's great," Hoke said in Wednes-
day's meeting with the Michigan
Associated Press Sports Editors.
"It's great for the fan base and the
public - the year-round recruit-
ing. (But) Michigan's not for every-
body. It's hard and demanding
from an academic standpoint, from
a social standpoint forwhat Michi-
gan represents, and the football
standpoint."
The Wolverines have had some
trouble with academics in the past,
most notably former quarterback
Tate Forcier. Though Forcier was
a hot prospect coming out of high
school, he struggled academically
and was forced to drop out.
Hoke noted that though there
are a lot of players with talent that
could fit into his system, he's not
just looking at scouting reports and
highlight reels.
"If you had the kids with charac-
ter who are football players, that's
who you want," he said. "I think
we're doing that now - there are
a lot of guys who have 'stars,' but
that's not what we're recruiting."
Hoke has had notable success
recruiting so far in his tenure,
especially in Ohio. In the class of
2012, nine of 25 incoming fresh-
men and eight of the 21 members
of the expanding class of 2013 hail
from the Buckeye state.
But with Urban Meyer as the
new head coach at Ohio State, the
'Brady vs. Urban' recruiting com-
petition has gained momentum
throughout the Midwest.
Though to Hoke, it's not about
recruiting against Meyer - it's
Michigan vs. Ohio State.
"You're talking about the great-
est rivalry in sports, and I don't
think that's ever changed," he said.
"This has never been (about) who's
the coach at Michigan (or at Ohio
State) - it's about those two great

As a teenager, I, like many other
girls, loved "The Notebook." It
was the ideal love story and, more
importantly, it included Ryan Gos-
ling. Since my teenage years, my
definition of romance has changed,
though Ryan Gosling will always
hold a special place in my heart.
"The Notebook" follows a famil-
iar yet alarmingpattern: boy wants
girl, girl does not want boy, boy
pressures girl, boy gets girl. Gavin
de Becker, a specialist in security
matters, explains in his book "The
Gift of Fear" that, "Girls are taught
from a young age to expect this
kind of behavior ... it is shown to
be a model for a love story, where
man pursues woman and gets her
regardless of her consent."
It's notable that in movies like
"Fatal Attraction," where the roles
are reversed, the ending is drasti-
cally different; instead of the girl
getting the boy, she ends up dead.
Movies like these perpetuate a dis-
turbing double standard. They sug-
gest that when a man says, "no," it's
final. But when a woman says, "no,"
it means try harder.
Though it's unfair to blame
society's attitudes solely on the
messages we find in movies, films
often reflect what we deem accept-
able as a culture. Unfortunately,
the norms enforced by Hollywood
can translate into chilling real-
life situations. For example, in
2010, one group of Yale frater-
nity pledges chanted, "'No' means
'yes!' 'Yes' means 'anal!"' in front
of women's dorms. The ramifica-
tions of these attitudes go beyond
offensive chants. According to the
U.S. Department of Justice, 25 per-
cent of college women are victims
of attempted or completed rape,
and 90 percent of these victims are
attacked by someone they already
know. These facts demonstrate
why our society desperately needs
a romance makeover.
We must ensure that both indi-
viduals in a relationship respect
their love interest's boundaries.
This means separating persis-

Redefine romance

Lessons from childhood

tence from courtship and teach-
ing people to honor the word "no."
While rejection is difficult for
everybody, accepting it is essential
for both parties. Gavin de Becker
asserts, "'No' is a word that must
never be negotiated, because the
person who chooses not to hear
it is trying to control you ... " Ser-
enading somebody with the help
of the school marching band ("10
Things I Hate About You"), watch-
ing somebody sleep ("Twilight") or
attempting to sabotage a wedding
("My Best Friend's Wedding") in
an effort to win someone over all
may seem romantic in the context
of a movie,rbut in fact suggest per-
sonality traits that could lead to
unhealthy relationships and poten-
tially unsafe situations.
Many fear that chivalry will die
if we change our interpretation of
romance. Redefining courtship
may be difficult, but it does not
mean that traditional elements of
dating, such as roses and choco-
lates, need to disappear - they will
just play a different role in roman-
tic pursuit. Besides, the roses will
smell sweeter coming from some-
one whom the receiver wants in his
or her life.
Hollywood, fortunately, already
has examples that demonstrate
what ahealthy courtship looks like.
For instance, in "The Notebook,"
there is a scene where the protago-
nist, Allie, debates between stay-
ing engaged to her fiance, Lon, or
reuniting with her old boyfriend,
Noah. After Allie tells him about
Noah, Lon says, "I love you, Allie,
but I want you for myself. I don't
want to have to convince my fian-
cee that she should be with me."
When Allie chooses Noah, Lon
leaves her alone. His actions were a
powerfulmicrocosm demonstrat-
ing what romance should be about:
respect. After the movie, I kept
wonderingif Lou ever found some-
body. Because that is a love story I
would want to hear about.

Since the death of the leg-
endary sci-
ence fiction
author Ray
Bradbury
last week,
there have
been many
statements of
admiration
and respect MICHAEL
from a wide SPAETH
variety of
people who
were influenced by the man and
his stories. One of the first state-
ments after Bradbury's death is
particularly interesting. Speaking
with io9.com, Bradbury's grand-
son, Danny Karapetian, lovingly
stated that Bradbury "was the
biggest kid I know."
Bradbury's childlike enthu-
siasm toward nearly every topic
he discussed is clearly evident in
video clips of the author. In sev-
eral of these clips, Bradbury has
a large plastic dinosaur in his
house, a visual representation of
the unbreakable bond between
his childhood interests and his
final years of life. It's remarkable
that he remained so consistently
excited and loved life so intensely
since the 1920s. It's difficult to
know for certain how he accom-
plished this feat, but it's helpful
to pay attention to the children
around us to gain insight.
Anyone who has ever seen the
wide eyes and half-open mouth of
a toddler knows that young chil-
dren in particular are extremely
curious about the world. While
we remain curious about top-
ics within our major, most stu-
dents aren't overcome with
curiosity about every little thing
we encounter in our day-to-day
lives. In contrast, young children
are fascinated with almost every-
thing around them. Their eyes
frequently scan their surround-
ings, fixating on objects both
large and small.

Neil deGrasse Tyson, astro-
physicist and host of "NOVA
scienceNOW," is a prominent
advocate for the benefits of curi-
osity, particularly among chil-
dren. "Kids are born scientists,"
he said in an interview in Decem-
ber. "They're bornprobing the
natural world that surrounds
them." He argues that children
should be allowed to conduct
their own "experiments" by get-
ting messy, banging household
items together and touching their
natural surroundings. "I think
the best thing a parent can do,
when raising a child, is simply get
out of their way," Tyson said.
It seems that as we become
preoccupied with additional
responsibilities and become more
cynical about life, we lose some
of this natural curiosity about
the world around us. Yet, even
though we aren't children any-
more and many of us won't enter
a science-related career field,
all of us can still use our natural
curiosity in more constructive
ways than we could have as chil-
dren. This allows us to use more
sophisticated tools to explore our
surroundings and run a lower
risk of accidentally hurting our-
selves in the process. Perhaps
most importantly, a sustained,
high level of curiosity allows our
minds to actively consider new
or less obvious concepts, which
could help spark innovative ideas
for a rapidly changing world.
Above all else, we should fully
engage in everything we do and
enjoy every minute of it, no mat-
ter how boring it may seem. One
of the best examples of this con-
cept is a popular YouTube video
of a 3-year-old boy conducting the
fourth movement of Beethoven's
Fifth Symphony. In the video, his
exaggerated gestures and emo-
tional facial expressions show that
he's completely in love with the
music. At such a young age, he's
unrestrained by formal technique

or the notion that he may possibly
look foolish. He's free to enjoy the
music in an incredibly pure way.
Unfortunately, we seem to lose
some of thisjoyful innocence aswe
become older.
Live like a
kid again and
explore.
Ray Bradbury also had a very
strong, pure love for books, comic
strips and movies. In interviews,
he repeatedly described how he
"fell in love" with just about every-
thing he did throughout his life.
His enthusiasm is infectious and
inspiring. Asa result of Bradbury's
unwavering love for life, he cre-
ated innovative stories that have
inspired generations of readers.
We're still young and have the
ability to change our attitudes
about the world around us. If we
get in the habit of being curious
about everything we do, con-
stantly asking questions and dig-
ging deeper, the world becomes a
much more interesting and beau-
tiful place. And when we love
a beautiful world, we naturally
become curious about everything
surrounding us. The powerful
interaction between curiosity
and love could be the secret to
not just a successful career and a
more innovative world, but also a
more fulfilling life.
Bradbury himself summed up
his life in the best words possible:
"Here lies Ray Bradbury, who loved
life completely." Summer break is
full of free time and infinite oppor-
tunities for discovery and enjoy-
ment. It's the perfect time to start
living by Bradbury's example.

"I think it's vital that we sup-

Hieftje explained that a major
misconception about accepting
a grant he often notices is that
accepting would commit money
the city uses for other services.
"Will accepting this grant in
any way compromise in any way
our ability to pay for essential ser-
vices like police and fire?" Hieftje
asked City Administrator Steve
Powers during the meeting.
"No," Powers replied.
"Prettysimple answer," Hieftje
said.
Hieftje said he views planning
and building a new station as a top
priority for Ann Arbor.
"If we're going to further our
economy, we're going to need
transit, and I can't think of a bet-
ter way to bring workers to Ann
Arbor than on a train (or) a more
environmentally-friendly way to
do that than having a robust rail
system," Hieftje said. "And as
we've all heard, the current sta-
tion we have is not going to sus-
tain that."

Motivation behind
abrupt departure
remains vague
By ADAM RUBENFIRE
Daily NewsEditor
Teresa Sullivan, former Uni-
versity provost and executive vice
president for academic affairs,
announced today that she will be
stepping down as president of the
University of Virginia after only
two years at the institution.
This morning in a press release,
the University of Virginia said its
Board of Visitors - a legislative
body similar to the University's
Board of Regents - and Sullivan
had "mutually agreed" that she
would resign from her position as
President, effective Aug.15.
Sullivan was quoted in the
release, saying a "philosophical dif-
ference of opinion" was the reason
for her departure.
This afternoon, in an address
to UVA vice presidents and deans,

University Rector Helen E. Dragas
- who serves as chair of the Board
of Visitors - suggested that Sulli-
van's exit came as a surprise to the
University.
"We know this news is a great
shock to the institution. We deeply
appreciate all that Terry has given
to the University over the last two
years," Dragas said, as reported by
the Cavalier Daily.
Sullivan previously announced
that she would leave the University
of Michigan in January 2010 after
receiving UVA's offer to be its next
president.
In an interview that January,
Sullivan told The Michigan Daily
she wasn't expecting UVA's offer.
She also told to the Daily that she
felt she had a "big learning curve"
going into the position, as she was
not familiar with the Board of
Visitors and the government of the
State of Virginia.
The Board of Visitors intends to
"expeditiously" appoint an interim
president, and will soon begin to
look for a new president, according
to the release.
