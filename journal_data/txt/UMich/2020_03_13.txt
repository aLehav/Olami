Ten 
additional 
cases 
of 
the 
COVID-19 
virus 
have 
been diagnosed in Michigan, 
officials 
announced 
late 
Thursday 
evening, 
leading 
to 
adjustments 
in 
state 
operations. This brings the 
total 
number 
of 
patients 
diagnosed with the COVID-19 
virus to 12 in Michigan.
According to Local 4 News, 
the new cases include:
A 
Washtenaw 
County 
woman 
and 
a 
Washtenaw 
County man, one who has 
domestic travel history and 
one 
who 
has 
previously 
traveled internationally
Two Kent County women 
and one Kent County man 
with histories of international 
travel
A St. Clair County man with 
who has previously traveled 
domestically
Two Oakland County men, 
one 
with 
domestic 
travel 

history and one with no travel 
history
A Montcalm County man 
with 
international 
travel 
history
An Ingham County woman 
who has previously traveled on 
a cruise
As of 9:30 p.m. Thursday, the 
state of Michigan’s coronavirus 
website confirms there are 26 
COVID-19 tests pending and 
172 people are being monitored 
after 
traveling 
to 
areas 
affected by the virus. Another 
554 people have been referred 
for assessment or monitoring.
Lynn 
Sutfin, 
public 
information officer for the 
Michigan 
Department 
of 
Health and Human Services, 
told Bridge Magazine the cases 
were not immediately known 
to be connected and were not 
in the same county, one of 
which was confirmed to be in 
St. Clair County. She said as 
of last week the state had the 
capacity to test 300 people but 
said they can now test 1,300 
people.

INDIANAPOLIS 
— 
Unlike 
previous years, this March has 
been defined by the madness 
taking place off the hardwood.
Amid 
the 
global 
COVID-
19 pandemic, the 2020 NCAA 
Tournament has been cancelled, 
according to a release from the 

NCAA. All spring and winter 
competitions are cancelled as 
well.
“This decision is based on the 
evolving COVID-19 public health 
threat, our ability to ensure 
the events do not contribute to 
spread of the pandemic, and the 
impracticality of hosting such 
events at any time during this 
academic year given ongoing 

decisions 
by 
other 
entities,” 
NCAA President Mark Emmert 
said in a statement.
The 
decision 
comes 
mere 
hours after each major Division 
I conference pulled the plug on 
their conference tournaments. 
The Ivy League — which cancelled 
its conference tournament on 
Wednesday — was the first domino 
to fall, and the rest of the country 

followed suit shortly after.
Less than 20 minutes before 
the beginning of Thursday’s four-
game Big Ten Tournament slate, 
conference commissioner Kevin 
Warren called off the tournament. 
Michigan 
and 
Rutgers 
were 
finishing pregame warmups when 
he made the final call.

With 
concerns 
and 
precautions growing due to 
COVID-19, 
the 
world 
has 
had 
to 
adapt. 
Yesterday, 
the University of Michigan 
moved 
all 
classes 
online, 
cancelled major events, pulled 
all 
current 
study 
abroad 
programs, as well as those 
scheduled 
for 
spring 
and 
summer, and cancelled sports. 
While campus remains open, 
many students are heading 
home to be with family and 
take classes remotely.
And so The Michigan Daily 
has to adapt, too. Friday’s 

paper will be The Daily’s 
last edition in print for the 
2020 winter term. Because 
the vast majority of our print 
papers 
are 
distributed 
to 
classroom buildings, it doesn’t 
make sense financially or 
environmentally to print a 
daily paper that won’t get 
picked up.
But we’re still here. And 
we’re bringing you the news 
every hour, every day of 
the week. For the rest of 
the semester, our staff will 
continue working tirelessly 
to keep the University of 
Michigan 
and 
Ann 
Arbor 
communities informed. Here 
are the various ways to keep 

up with The Daily for the next 
six weeks.

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer ordered 
a shutdown of all K-12 schools 
in Michigan until April 5 in an 
attempt to slow the spread of the 
COVID-19 virus.
In a press release Thursday 
evening, Whitmer said the closure 
of all public, private and boarding 
schools is a necessary step to 
protect 
Michigan’s 
children, 
families and overall public health.
“I am working with partners 
across state government to ensure 
educators, parents, and students 
have the support they need during 
this time, and to ensure our children 
who rely on school for meals have 
access to food,” Whitmer said in 
the press release. “I know this will 
be a tough time, but we’re doing 
this to keep the most people we 
can safe. I urge everyone to make 
smart choices during this time and 
to do everything they can to protect 
themselves and their families.” 
Hours 
before 
Whitmer’s 
announcement, Ann Arbor Public 
Schools closed its schools through 
April 6 in response to COVID-
19, according to a letter from 
Superintendent Jeanice Swift 
published Thursday afternoon.

The University of Michigan 
is 
suspending 
all 
study 
abroad programs effective 
immediately and asking all 
students to return to the 
United States by March 20, 
according to an email from 
Rachel Reuter, Center for 
Global 
and 
Intercultural 
Study 
health 
and 
safety 
adviser, sent Thursday. 
University President Mark 
Schlissel released a statement 
Wednesday 
alerting 
the 
community 
about 
changes 
to University classes, events 
and 
protocol. 
Following 
that, in a series of emails 
sent over a period spanning 
less than 24 hours, CGIS 
students were informed that 
their programs were being 
canceled, they would need 
to self-quarantine for two 
weeks if they had been in any 
of the Centers for Disease 
Control 
and 
Prevention’s 
Level 3 countries and they 
would need to come home by 
next Friday.

Regent 
Ron 
Weiser 
(R), 
accused 
Dr. 
Robert 
Anderson, 
the 
late 
University 
of 
Michigan 
sports 
physician, 
of 
sexually 
assaulting 
him 
while he was a student in 
the 1960s, according to an 
interview with The Detroit 
News published Thursday 
morning.
Weiser 
said 
he 
first 
encountered 
Anderson 
during his freshman year on 
the wrestling team.
“It happened a long time 
ago, but we have to make 
sure it never happens again,” 
Weiser told The Detroit 
News. “We have to have an 
investigation to do that, and 
that’s what’s going on right 
now. I want the stories to 
come out. ... I am coming 
forward for one reason. I 
want to encourage other 
survivors to come forward 
and share their experiences 
in a safe, confidential and 
secure environment.”
Other former students and 
employees of the University 
have spoken out against 
Anderson. Former wrestler 
Tad 
Deluca 
submitted 
a 
letter 
to 
then-athletic 
director Don Canham in 
1975 and again in 2018 to 
current University athletic 
director 
Warde 
Manuel 
detailing 
his 
experiences 
with 
Anderson, 
though 
he said these letters were 
ignored.
In 
response 
to 
the 
accusations, the University 
set up a hotline on Feb. 19 

for former patients who 
believed they were abused 
by Anderson. As of March 
2, the University received 
more than 103 complaints.
Weiser 
spoke 
to 
investigators hired by the 
University 
to 
look 
into 
claims against Anderson, 
but, in the interview with 
The 
Detroit 
News, 
he 
declined to disclose what he 
said to them.
The University was the 
subject of criticism over the 
firm it selected to conduct 
the outside investigation, 
Steptoe & Johnson LLP.
On 
March 
5, 
Michael 
Nimmo, an attorney from 
Wahlberg, 
Woodruff, 
Nimmo 
& 
Sloane, 
LLP 
urged 
victims 
not 
to 
call the hotline due to 
privacy 
concerns. 
At 
a 
press conference, Nimmo 
described 
meeting 
with 
Tim Lynch, vice president 
and 
general 
counsel 
of 
the 
University, 
to 
voice 
his 
worries 
about 
Steptoe & Johnson LLP’s 
investigation.
“A primary purpose of 
our meeting was to express 
to them some legal concerns 
that we have about the 
investigation, about how it’s 
being conducted and about 
how they intend to ensure 
confidentiality 
of 
these 
victims’ identities,” Nimmo 
said. “At the current time, 
we’re advising our clients 
to not talk with Steptoe 
lawfirm.”
Steptoe & Johnson LLP 
has also faced backlash for 
its representation of high-
profile clients accused of 
sexual assault, a group that 
includes Jeffrey Epstein, a 
financier who committed 

suicide after being charged 
with 
multiple 
counts 
of 
sexual 
assault, 
and 
convicted 
child 
rapist 
Roman Polanksi, director 
of “Oliver Twist” and other 
films.
Following this criticism, 
the University ceased its 
work with the law firm. In a 
statement released March 7, 
University President Mark 
Schlissel and the Board 
of Regents, which Weiser 
oversees 
as 
chairman, 
announced 
the 
school 
would no longer work with 
the attorney at the Steptoe 
and Johnson out of fear it 
“could discourage survivors 
hurt by Dr. Anderson from 
coming forward.”
“As a result, we have 
decided 
to 
engage 
a 
different firm to complete 
the 
investigation, 
while 
working to ensure a smooth 
transition and continue the 
progress we have made,” 
the statement reads. “We 
will have more details in 
the very near future.”
The University has not 
yet named a new law firm 
to run the investigation.
Weiser will be involved 
in setting policy related 
to the investigation and 
plans for the University to 
protect itself from lawsuits. 
However, Weiser said there 
will be no conflict with his 
work.
“As an individual who 
loves this University, as 
the chair of the Board of 
Regents and one of the 
university’s largest donors, 
I know that there is only 
one way that we can truly 
understand what happened 
and how to make certain 
it never happens again,” 

Weiser told The Detroit 
News. “We must encourage 
survivors to come forward 
and tell their story, and 
protect their privacy.”
Weiser has a long history 
of 
involvement 
at 
the 
University and is a major 
donor to the school.
Weiser was first elected 
to the Board of Regents 
in 
2016. 
He 
and 
his 
wife 
have 
also 
founded 
the 
Weiser 
Center 
for 
Emerging 
Democracies 
and the Weiser Center for 
Europe and Eurasia at the 
University, in addition to 
serving as deputy chairs for 
the Victors For Michigan 
campaign.
He gifted $10 million to 
the Ross School of Business 
in February for the creation 
of a new real estate center. 
Another 
$10-million 
donation 
established 
the 
Weiser Diplomacy Center 
at 
the 
Ford 
School 
of 
Public Policy, which hosted 
a 
series 
of 
prominent 
speakers last fall, including 
2016 presidential candidate 
Hillary 
Clinton 
and 
former Secretary of State 
Condoleezza Rice.
Weiser 
is 
also 
an 
influential 
figure 
in 
Michigan 
and 
national 
politics. He formerly served 
as a U.S. ambassador to 
Slovakia and was chairman 
of the Michigan Republican 
Party until 2019, when he 
stepped down after being 
diagnosed 
with 
prostate 
cancer.

Every Friday, one Daily staffer will give a behind-the-scenes 
look at one of this week’s stories. This week, LSA & SMTD 
senior Julia Fanzeres on her story “Bernie Sanders sits down 
with The Michigan Daily to discuss voter appeal, turnout”: 

“What was interesting about it was to get the interview with 
Senator Sanders, I had to contact his campaign offices, his 
Senate offices, contact a multitude of people until they got 
back to me. So I think that the process, going through those 
phone calls and tracking everyone down to get those five 
minutes with the Senator,” Fanzeres said. “It was completely 
surreal to be interviewing someone who could potentially be 
the president of the United States and who has really created 
a political revolution in the democratic party and with young 
voters through his grassroots campaign. It was completely 
surreal.”

QUOTE OF THE WE E K 

“
What history is about is to understand that there have been 
extraordinarily brave people throughout history. People who’ve put 
their lives on the line, sometimes who have died, gone to jail in the 
struggle for justice. And that is what this campaign is about. That is 
what Jesse Jackson’s life has been about, that is what Alexandria’s 
life is about. And that’s what I hope all of your lives will be about.”

Linda 
Vail, 
Ingham 
County 
health 
officer, 
told 
Bridge 
Magazine 
more cases will likely 
be confirmed as testing 
increases. She said public 
companies 
will 
offer 
testing at doctors’ offices 
in 
addition 
to 
tests 
provided by the state. 
As of Thursday, Ingham 
County had seven tests: 
two negative and five 
pending.
Washtenaw 
County 
was 
the 
first 
to 
temporarily close schools 
and transition to online 
learning in light of the 
illness. 
The 
Michigan 
State 
Senate approved a bill 
authorizing up to $75 
million for coronavirus 
preparation 
and 
response, 
$50 
million 
in federal funding in 
addition to $10 million 
in 
state 
revenue 
for 
monitoring, 
testing, 
tracing, 
control 
and 
maintaining 
necessary 
state 
functions. 
The 
state will also direct $15 
million to a Coronavirus 
Response Fund for future 
use.
The Michigan Capitol 
suspended 
all 
tours 
and events through at 
least May 1. However, 
the Michigan House of 
Representatives plans to 
continue meeting in the 
building and will adjust 
protocols 
to 
increase 
safety 
measures. 
This 
includes allowing non-
essential or older staff 
members to remain at 
home 
and 
suspending 
gatherings. 
The 
Michigan State Senate 
will 
meet 
as 
needed 
beginning next week.
The 
first 
two 
individuals 
were 
diagnosed 
with 
the 
COVID-19 
virus 
in 
Michigan late Tuesday 
evening. 
The 
cases 
include 
an 
Oakland 
County woman with a 
history of international 
travel 
and 
a 
Wayne 
County 
man 
with 
a 
history 
of 
domestic 
travel. 
Michigan 
Medicine 
announced 
Wednesday morning that 
one of the two patients is 
currently an inpatient at 
Michigan Medicine.
The 
University 
of 
Michigan 
canceled 
classes March 12 and 13 
and students will move to 
online classes beginning 
March 16 until the end of 
the semester.

Schools will be open for a 
half-day on Friday.
In 
her 
letter, 
Swift 
wrote the school system 
will monitor the situation 
throughout 
the 
closure. 
She noted AAPS is taking 
action in alignment with 
the 
Washtenaw 
County 
Health 
Department, 
the 
City of Ann Arbor, the 
Washtenaw 
Intermediate 
School 
District, 
other 
area 
Washtenaw 
school 
districts and the Michigan 
Department of Education, 
but it is a preventative, not 
reactive, measure — there 
is no currently known case 
of COVID-19 in the school 
system.
“These 
are 
sobering 
days 
for 
all 
of 
us 
in 
confronting 
the 
COVID-
19 pandemic,” Swift wrote. 
“We understand that this 
situation is likely to impact 
almost every aspect of our 
lives, and we know we must 
work together like never 
before to help each other as 

individuals, neighbors, and 
as a community.”
The return date, April 
6, is the Monday directly 
following AAPS’s originally 
scheduled, 
week-long 
spring break.
Swift 
cited 
the 
need 
to “flatten the curve” in 
making their decision, a 
term Michigan Medicine 
has used to describe the 
importance 
of 
taking 
preventative action within 
communities 
to 
avoid 
having large numbers in 
hospitals.
“During these upcoming 
two 
weeks 
we 
will 
be 
working 
alongside 
our 
excellent 
teachers, 
staff, 
and 
administrators 
to 
ensure 
learning 
opportunities will continue 
in the Ann Arbor Public 
Schools,” 
Swift 
wrote. 
“Like many other things in 
our lives, this will look a 
little different. These plans 
are still developing, and 
though they will not be the 
same as what we enjoy now, 
students in our classrooms 
with our teachers, learning 
will continue in the AAPS.”

She also noted the half-
day will be used for students 
to 
collect 
books 
and 
personal items and connect 
with teachers before the 
extended 
school 
closure 
begins. After-school care 
and certain spring break 
programs have also been 
canceled.
Swift 
said 
they 
will 
continue to provide meals 
for students who rely on 
school meals to eat. Staff 
will also be compensated 
for this extended closure, 
Swift said.
The 
decision 
followed 
Saline 
Area 
Schools 
announcing 
Wednesday 
that 
it 
will 
close 
its 
school 
system 
until 
April 6. According to a 
letter 
published 
online, 
Superintendent 
Scot 
Graden noted students will 
not be required to complete 
coursework remotely
“This is an unprecedented 
emergency school closure 
and a public health situation 
that is rapidly evolving,” 
Graden wrote.
In line with the AAPS 
closure, 
the 
City 
of 

Ann 
Arbor 
announced 
the 
implementation 
of 
additional 
precautions 
beginning tomorrow until 
April 5.

members 
Thursday 
evening 
said 
all city-permitted events 
expecting 
50 
or 
more 
attendees 
are 
canceled, 
and events with fewer than 
50 attendees must address 
proper 
social 
distancing 
procedures. The Ann Arbor 
Farmers Market will close 
on March 14 and all parks 
facilities have closed. 
Hash Bash, an annual 
marijuana-focused 
event 
held in the Diag in April, 
has been postponed. The 
student 
group 
usually 
responsible for organizing 
the event will not be able 
to get a permit, as the 
University of Michigan has 
banned events with more 
than 100 people.

City 
Council 
meetings 
will continue to be held, 
but the city encourages 
the public to watch the live 
stream meetings and use 
comments if they would 
like to comment on items on 
the agenda.
In an interview with The 
Daily, Ann Arbor Mayor 
Christopher Taylor advised 
Ann Arbor citizens and 
University 
of 
Michigan 
students to take precautions 
to slow the spread of the 
COVID-19 virus, such as 
washing their hands and 
practicing social distances.
“I 
want 
Ann 
Arbor 
residents 
and 
students 
to both remain calm and 
vigilant,” Taylor said. “It’s 
important that people take 
this seriously, that they take 
personal responsibility for 
their own personal hygiene 
and hygiene as it applies to 
others.”

“We realize that this may 
be extremely disappointing 
to you, but the University 
is 
committed 
first 
and 
foremost to your health and 
safety, and to ensuring the 
academic quality of your 
studies,” Reuter wrote. “Even 
if your academic institution 
continues to operate, you are 
no longer eligible to continue 
attending class on-site as an 
enrolled student – you must 
return to the United States.”
Reuter acknowledged the 
stress some students may be 
feeling about their academic 
standing after having to 
leave 
their 
classes 
mid-
semester and assured the 
recipients that everything 
would be figured out after 
they had returned safely to

Michigan will cease all 
athletic events — including 
offseason 
practices 
and 
spring recruiting — through 
the remainder of the 2019-
20 academic year as part 
of a Big Ten-wide decision. 
The Wolverines will also 
forbid 
coaches 
from 
off-
campus 
recruiting 
and 
hosting recruits on official 
or unofficial campus visits 
during the time period. 
“Today, 
we 
took 
the 

unprecedented and proactive 
decision 
to 
suspend 
intercollegiate activities to 
protect the health and well-
being of our student-athletes, 
staff 
and 
community 
members,” Michigan athletic 
director Warde Manuel said 
in a statement. “This decision, 
reached in collaboration with 
the Big Ten Conference and 
campus leaders, was reached 
after 
thorough 
discussion 
and was necessary given 
the magnitude of this global 
issue.
“The 
hard 
work 
and 
dedication of our student-
athletes, coaches and staff 

is a source of inspiration 
for so many. So, too, will be 
our response as we confront 
the spread of this global 
pandemic. On behalf of our 
entire department, I thank 
the 
Big 
Ten 
Conference, 
presidents 
and 
athletic 
directors, our head coaches 
and 
community 
partners 
who have offered input and 
unwavering support.”
For the Wolverines, the 
cancellation brings an abrupt 
end to a time of year brimming 
with promise. During the 
first few weeks of the spring 
season, Michigan established 
itself as a national contender 

in baseball, softball, tennis 
and gymnastics, among other 
sports.
For 
basketball 
in 
particular, 
cancellations 
snowballed quickly. Shortly 
after the Big Ten cancelled its 
men’s basketball tournament, 
a mass cancellation of other 
conference 
tournaments 
ensued. Among the leaders 
of the movement was Duke 
athletic 
director 
Kevin 
White, who made waves by 
suspending all Blue Devil 
teams 
from 
competition 
indefinitely. As the chair of 
the NCAA Men’s Basketball 
Committee, White’s decision 

was 
the 
writing 
on 
the 
wall 
for 
national-level 
cancellations.
“Some things are bigger 
than basketball,” Wolverines’ 
coach Juwan Howard said 
in a statement. “This is a 
global situation and we need 
to make sure we follow the 
guidance and direction of the 
experts and health officials. 
… We want everyone to stay 
safe and take precautions to 
protect yourselves and loved 
ones.”

around 
the world,” Reuter wrote. 
“While 
we 
understand 
there are questions about 
credit 
transfer, 
academics, 
and many other important 
issues, our priority at the 
moment is to help support 
our current students abroad 
in their efforts to return 
home as safely and quickly as 
possible.”
LSA junior Sofia Spencer 
is 
studying 
abroad 
in 
England and 
said she will 
be 
heading 
home as soon 
as 
possible 
after 
the 
University 
recalled 
students 
studying 
abroad. 
“I 
am 
angry,” 
Spencer said. 
“I am sad. 
Michigan 
isn’t helping 
me 
come 
home. 
Oxford was 
going to let 
me stay, but 
Michigan 
was 
so 
focused 
on 
image 
that 
they 
are 
forcing me to abandon my 
chances and come back.”
She 
said 
while 
the 
University wasn’t covering 
the cost of last-minute travel 
arrangements, other students 
in her program from Princeton 
University did not have to pay 
the fees themselves.
Engineering 
sophomore 
Mitchell Levi is studying 
abroad in Australia through 
International 
Programs 
in Engineering and is also 
having difficulty with the 
short notice.
“I found out we had to 
leave when Schlissel emailed 
the 
whole 
university 
and 
was very vague,” Levi said. 
“IPE followed up a couple 
hours later and said that it 
did in fact apply to us and 
that they would give us more 
information in the next 24 
hours.”
Levi said IPE told students 
they had 10 days to leave or 
they would be unenrolled for 
the semester. 
“I currently do not have 
a 
flight 
back 
yet,” 
Levi 

said. “My family is actually 
supposed to be coming to visit 
me this weekend and they are 
supposed to be here until the 
29th so they want me to stay 
until then which is longer than 
the 10 days given. I am still 
waiting on more information 
about how this will affect our 
courses that we are halfway 
through at University of New 
South Wales. This has left 
me very disappointed and 

confused why we have to go 
back when the situation is 
better in Australia than it is 
in the States.”
LSA junior Mark Castañeda 
is studying abroad in New 
Zealand. “I feel extremely 
disrespected 
individually 
that the University is refusing 
to take into account the 
differences among individual 
programs 
and 
making 
widespread blanket policies. 
The University is refusing 
to cooperate with me and 
my 
fellow 
students, 
and 
disregarding the autonomy 
of the parent institution with 
which I am studying abroad. 
Furthermore the bureaucracy 
and 
lack 
of 
personalized 
communication is insulting 
and incredibly upsetting. My 
own safety is actually being 
put at stake as well as that 
of my family by sending me 
home without considering the 
risks in the United States as 
compared to the significantly 
safer infrastructure in New 
Zealand.”
On 
Wednesday 
night, 

President 
Donald 
Trump 
announced 
restrictions 
on 
travel from most European 
countries 
for 
non-U.S. 
citizens. Additionally, most 
of 
Europe 
joined 
China, 
Italy and Iran as a Level 3 
destination 
according 
to 
the CDC, banning all non-
essential travel. 
In an email sent to students 
currently studying abroad 
in Europe on March 11 at 

11:30 p.m. EST, Amy Conger, 
University director of Global 
Engagement, urged students 
to make travel plans and 
return to the United States as 
fast as possible. Conger also 
reassured them the travel 
ban does not apply to legal 
U.S. residents. 
“We strongly encourage 
those 
affected 
by 
this 
proclamation 
to 
change 
your travel plans NOW and 
book travel back to the U.S,” 
Conger said. “Before the 
proposed entry restrictions 
take effect on Friday, March 
13 @ midnight.” 
In Germany, another of 
the countries impacted by 
Trump’s travel restrictions, 
LSA junior Ben Solberg said 
he is struggling to make do 
with the few details provided 
to him.
“It’s 
frustrating 
to 
be 
sent 
home 
with 
limited 
information 
about 
how 
credits, payments and arrival 
will work, but I know that 
the steps being taken are an 
attempt to slow the spread of 

disease,” Solberg said.
LSA junior Marisa Garten 
is in Barcelona but was 
taking 
classes 
through 
Cultural 
Experiences 
Abroad, a third-party study 
abroad coordinator. She said 
she found out she would have 
to leave the country, not 
because of the University’s 
requirements, but because 
of the European travel ban 
announced by Trump early 
Thursday morning. 
“My 
roommate 
started 
screaming 
that 
we 
had 
to 
leave,” 
Garten 
said. 
“Basically our friend had 
called her and said that 
the president is currently 
closing the borders from 
Europe in two days and we 
all have to get out, so I ran to 
my computer and my parents 
called me the minute that it 
happened. And I booked my 
flight like 30 seconds after I 
heard.”
Garten 
said 
she 
paid 
around $900 for her flight, 
but some of her friends who 
didn’t act as quickly to book 
tickets out of the country 
paid 
several 
thousand 
dollars for theirs. She said 
the situation has left her sad 
and upset. 
“Mostly 
I 
regret 
not 
traveling more, and I regret 
postponing 
some 
of 
the 
things that I wanted to 
go see because I thought 
I would have more time,” 
Garten said. 
Once she flies back to 
the U.S., Garten said she 
will have to self-quarantine 
at home in New York for 
two weeks because Spain 
is classified as a Level 3 
country by the CDC.
“I’m gonna have to self-
quarantine working myself 
for two weeks back at home 
and everyone, all my friends 
are back on campus, and all 
my friends that I met here 
don’t live anywhere really 
around,” Garten said. “ … I’m 
definitely upset and I regret 
that I didn’t get things done 
fast enough in terms of I didn’t 
go enough places while I was 
here. Also, because of all the 
trips that I had planned, that 
I’m not going to get my money 
back for that … and that is 
very frustrating.”

W

hen I was an optimistic 
high school freshman, I 
tried out for the varsity 
swim team. Armed with Banana 
Boat sunscreen and a hideous two-
piece bathing suit, I entered the pool 
woefully unaware of basic swimming 
technique yet determined to make 
varsity. Although I succeeded in 
making the team (too few girls tried 
out for the team at the tiny, all-girls 
Catholic school I attended for anyone 
to be turned away), I quickly realized 
swimming wasn’t my true calling. 
I’m certainly not an athlete.
But I am a Supreme Court geek. 
Even in my days as an un-athletic 
freshman, I skimmed Supreme 
Court dockets to see the cases and 
controversies that would be debated 
in the next few months. That habit 
has followed me to this day; even 
as a busy college student I still read 
Supreme Court blogs. 
This year, the Supreme Court 
will decide a landmark case about 
employee discrimination. In 2010, 
Donald Zarda was fired from 
his job as a skydiving instructor 
after he revealed he was gay (he 
mentioned his sexuality to a female 
client who was strapped to him for 
a jump in an attempt to make her 
more comfortable with the close 
physical contact between the two). 
Nearly a decade and several appeals 
later, Altitude Express Inc. v. Zarda 
concerns whether the Civil Rights 
Act’s language protects against 
employment discrimination based 
on an individual’s sexual orientation. 
Legal scholars and activists are 
wondering whether the Supreme 
Court will rule in favor of protections 
for employers or employees.
This is not the first time the 
Supreme Court has considered 
sexuality and discrimination. In 
1986, the majority opinion in Bowers 
v. Hardwick compared homosexual 
activity to “incest … and other sexual 
crimes” when considering the case 
of a police officer who had engaged 
in consensual sodomy; sodomy was 
criminalized in the state of Georgia 
until Bowers was overturned in 
2003. In 2000, Boy Scouts v. Dale 
ruled that Boy Scouts of America’s 
decision to fire an employee because 

he was openly gay was protected 
under the First Amendment. It was 
reasonable, the decision reads, for the 
Boy Scouts of America to claim that 
homosexual activity was antithetical 
to the Boy Scouts’ mission to be 
“morally straight” and “clean.”
Since 
1986, 
however, 
much 
of 
the 
legal 
discourse 
about 
employee 
discrimination 
has 
shifted to a debate about conflicting 
individual rights. Zarda is one of 
the first cases since Dale to directly 
address 
discrimination 
against 
employees. More recent cases about 
homosexuality and discrimination 
have focused on the clash between 
religious liberty and the individual 
right to privacy as opposed to the 
debate about whether homosexuality 
is morally acceptable. In some ways, 
it’s easy to look back on that stinging 
Bowers decision and view it as 
part of a controversial past, but the 
arguments made in Zarda prove 
things haven’t changed much.
Legal 
scholars 
who 
defend 
employers’ interests argue that 
“sexual orientation” isn’t a protected 
status in the Civil Rights Act the 
same way that “sex” or “age” is. It 
would certainly be unreasonable 
to expect the Supreme Court to 
rule on protections that have never 
existed. 
But 
the 
fundamental 
problem with this argument is that 
it ignores the interaction between 
sex and orientation as applied to 
civil rights protections.
Let’s use the word “sex” as 
defined in the Civil Rights Act as 
strictly biological sex (i.e., male 
or female as assigned at birth) to 
understand how it still applies 
as a protection against sexual 
orientation discrimination. Zarda’s 
biological sex certainly played a 
role in his employer’s decision to 
terminate his gay employee. If 
Donald Zarda had been a woman in 
a relationship with a man instead of 
a man in a relationship with a man, 
there would not have been a reason 
to fire him. 
Furthermore, 
neither 
the 
Constitution nor existing legislation 
account for the cultural and social 
changes that create shifts in 
societal norms. After all, at the time 

of the Civil Rights Act’s passage in 
1964, homosexuality was defined 
as a mental illness by the American 
Psychiatric Association. Even if 
sexual orientation isn’t explicitly 
addressed within the text of 
the Civil Rights Act, the logic of 
protections on the basis of sex allow 
sexual orientation discrimination 
to be understood as a subset of 
biological sex discrimination.
Beside my short tenure as a 
swimmer, I recall many other 
awkward moments from high 
school. I think of my younger 
self cringing as she changed into 
her new, aerodynamic one-piece, 
struggling to reconcile the feelings 
she had about herself and her own 
sexuality. I think about standing at 
the deep end of the pool, breathing 
in chlorine and trying not to 
remember that one time I found 
“Annie on My Mind” in the school 
library (it is unclear to me still 
how that got past the all-seeing 
librarian). I think of myself staring 
down the crucifix at the front of my 
sixth-period math class, wondering 
if I was morally straight and clean.
Zarda is not a case about 
religious beliefs, or about whether 
homosexuality is acceptable and 
appropriate, or about whether we 
should all be Christan. This is a 
case about an individual’s right — 
most importantly, the right to live 
without being afraid or ashamed, 
regardless of what they believe.
There are some things that just 
are in the world. Children routinely 
picked last for dodgeball teams 
are not destined to be the next 
Michael Phelps. The Cats movie 
adaptation 
is 
an 
abomination 
worthy of Leviticus. Some people 
are attracted to members of the 
same sex. 
Some people who vandalize 
property and commit hate crimes 
at Pride events will continue to do 
so, regardless of how many court 
decisions tell them it’s wrong. That 
doesn’t mean the Supreme Court 
should cease to uphold LGBTQ+ 
rights anyway.

When someone talks about “the arts,” the first 
thing that comes to mind is usually some form of self-
expression, like painting or photography. Very rarely 
do we talk about art in the same breath as running, but 
why not? We’re exploring this question with “Daily Arts 
Runs a Marathon.” However, due to the rising concerns 
surrounding a certain virus, our endeavor ends here, with 
our runners reflecting on their training, or lack thereof, 
before the run was cancelled and we scattered to our 
respective corners of the world. 
Here’s what I talk about when I talk about running: 
being unprepared. If we’re mentioning running — a 
race, a campaign, away from somebody — in relation to 
art, it might just be best to be softly unprepared. In arts 
and media, it’s usually the likely losers we find ourselves 
rooting for, whether they’re in last place from the start 
of a race or merely the underdog. Authors and artists 
like to make the little guy break through unexpectedly, 
maybe because this so rarely happens in real life.
Think Katniss Everdeen, the good and moral 
underdog, jumping to victory. Or the unlikely 
protagonist’s solving of a crime. The odd man out, 
strange but lovingly good, racing to find true love. We’d 
like to hope these revelations are maybe possible in real 
life, too.
Such methodology may or may not be the way to 
apply real-life race prep, though. As of spring break, I 
decidedly abandoned this shoddy method. Over break, 
I gave in to prepping for the Arts marathon at last, 
training on the unfriendly slopes of California. The air 
was thin and dry and the trail made of endless hills. 
With the weather back to a decent place in Michigan, 
we’ll see if this preparation — and deciding against the 
fantasy of an attempted underdog story — continues as 
planned.
— John Decker, Daily Arts Runner

I’ve had a strange relationship with running since 
joining the track team in 8th grade, one rooted in 
an even stranger relationship with my weight since 
elementary school. I always think back to when I was 
15 years old, running high-school cross-country. I was 
in the shape of my life at 130 pounds (I’m only 5’6”), I 
was breaking my personal record almost every 5k race, 
I was on track to make varsity by senior year and maybe 

even earn the six-pack abs I’d irrationally wanted since 
I was 10 years old.
When I volunteered to run in the Daily Arts relay a 
few months back, I was 40 pounds heavier and hadn’t 
touched my running shoes since high school.
At some point in early 2015 I began to dread running. 
Over the last five years I decided I hated running, 
hated my Saturdays spent at races, hated the pain in my 
shins, hated working up a sweat and hated every step I 
took at a pace faster than three miles an hour. I think 
what I actually hated was feeling left out on the cross-
country team — while my team was bonding, I spent 
90% of my free time hiding in my room. In hindsight, 
quitting cross-country was a symptom of my untreated 
depression.
But that dread persisted far beyond treating my 
mental health. In five years I haven’t gone for a run 
more than 10 times, each of those few runs taking 
enormous mental strength. I was discouraged going 
from six, seven, eight miles to barely capable of a half-
mile. I was discouraged watching my weight gain rack 
up.
Fast forward to 2020. A month before the Probility 
Ann Arbor Marathon, I heard my fellow runners 
talking about how their training was going. Everyone 
was hard at work. One friend invited me to run together. 
I declined.
In a word, my training has been dreadful. Less than 
two weeks before the marathon, I’ve run only three 
times: today, yesterday and the day before. None were 
more than a mile. All three runs I dreaded terribly, but 
yesterday’s run a little bit less than the day before’s, 
and today’s run a little bit less than yesterday’s. I’ve 
accepted that I’ll have to take my six- or seven-mile leg 
of the relay really slow. But that’s okay with me. I hope 
that over the next 10 days, I’ll incrementally reduce my 
marathon dread. And maybe, just maybe, I’ll put my 
running shoes back on the day after.
— Dylan Yono, Daily Arts Runner

For the better part of a decade, I’ve been telling 
myself that “I love running.” At first, this was a bold-
faced lie — can you imagine any seventh grader actually 
enjoying the act of running? There were middle school 
track teams, of course, but we were all still blindly 
listening to our parents at that age, just on the cusp 
of being able to say, “why in the world would I ever 
voluntarily run anywhere?” 
The only reason I started running was to get more 

play time on the soccer field, but I could not tell you 
why I kept going. With the last few weeks of training, 
though, I’ve been thinking more about my relationship 
with my runs and I decided to categorize them into 
three major types. 
First, we have the procrastination run. There are a 
variety of ways to avoid responsibilities and going on a 
six-mile run is one of the best ones out there. It takes 
me about an hour and a half in total (if we include the 
cool down and the shower) and for those 90 minutes I 
am blissfully ignoring the fact that I don’t know how 
organic chemistry works while The Backstreet Boys 
blast in my headphones. 
Then, my personal favorite, is the run where I’m ever 
so slightly sick, but not sick enough that I should stay in 
bed. Have a cough? Put on the running shoes and let the 
cool winter air clean your lungs. A little bit nauseous? 
Keeping yourself moving, especially in the winter, 
is the perfect cure. Winter runs to cure an illness are 
my foolproof method to avoid sickness. Well, that and 
downing an eight-ounce glass of Emergen-C. 
Finally, it’s the fun run. This is the run where 
everything works out — I actually remembered to warm 
up, I found my fancy running socks and the sky is clear. 
These runs, though not rare, are also not representative 
of how the majority of my runs go. With a fun run, all I 
want to do is be outside, feet hitting the pavement. My 
pace is strong, and I don’t even realize it. Sometimes it’s 
snowing, sometimes the leaves are just changing color. 
Either way, the weather is a non-factor with a fun run. 
What matters is that, for whatever reason, my brain 
turns off and it’s just me, my music and the burning in 
my lungs. 
— Emma Chang, Daily Arts Runner 

 Wintertime in Michigan is not an ideal time to train 
for a race. Between the icy sidewalks and piercing cold 
air, I find it difficult to log some miles outside instead 
of staying curled up on the couch. Even when it’s been 
warm for a few days, you never know what you’ll run 
into as you trek alongside Michigan roads. Just the 
other day I was running in 40 degree weather and met 
an icy slope through the Arb, forcing me to slowly skate 
up the hill at 10 minutes per mile.
Despite the unpredictability and unpleasantness 
of Michigan winters, I still find myself lacing up my 
shoes and hitting the road everyday. When I’m in need 
of some extra motivation, I look to one of my favorite 
professional runners, Des Linden, for inspiration. She 

won the Boston Marathon back in 2018, has made two 
appearances at the Olympics and she trains full time 
in northern Michigan, logging nearly twenty miles a 
day running through the ice and snow. When I see her 
occasional post on Instagram, I’m inspired by her will 
to become a better athlete. 
I’ve always had a complicated relationship with 
running — some days the miles come easily and I feel 
like I can run forever, but other days I struggle to find 
the fire that keeps my legs moving forward. Regardless 
of whether I’m flying through an eight mile run or 
barely pushing past three, running is and has always 
been an escape from the stress of daily life. 
In running it’s easy to get caught up in PRs and 
mileage; however at the end of the day, I don’t run for 
numbers but for myself. I would have been excited 
to take on this relay with some talented writers and 
to share in the pain and sense of accomplishment of 
running as we cross the finish line. 
— Kaitlyn Fox, Daily Arts Runner 

After riding the bench of my high school basketball 
team for four consecutive years, I have risen from the 
ashes to make yet another embarrassing athletic debut. 
Look at me now, coach. Who “doesn’t have the stamina” 
now, coach?
Training for this run has felt a lot like a coming-of-
age indie movie when the manic pixie dream human 
says, “I like to run a lot, it makes me feel like I’m in 
control,” followed by a montage of sunset runs in their 
worn-down converse. It’s me, my mind and a treadmill, 
telling myself mawkish quotes like “this body is capable 
of anything, Cantie.” I say this to myself so that no 
one hears. I have yet to run outside. Only treadmills. 
Outside makes things real. 
I’ve created the habit of never looking at how far I’ve 
run. Rather, I measure myself in songs. When a beat can 
distract me from the discomfort, I hit that video-game-
frenzy mode; my body goes rainbow, speed picks up, 
and glitter stars start shooting out of my body. 
The most riveting discovery of training for the 
Probility Marathon Relay: The second you become OK 
with discomfort, you’ll find comfort. These life lessons 
about control and pain have kept me coming back to 
the treadmill, and perhaps they’ll keep me coming back 
when the race — now canceled — would have been over.

DAILY RUNNING COLUMN

The following review contains spoilers.
If you were to watch season one of “Ugly 
Delicious” without prior knowledge of David 
Chang’s 
somewhat 
acerbic 
“Chang-ian” 
demeanor — one that has vaulted him into fame 
since his founding of Momofuku Noodle Bar — 
you may bristle to Chang’s authoritative ideals 
and opinions within the culinary landscape. 
Chang’s insistence towards (East and Southeast) 
Asian prominence colors your understanding 
and position of food cultures dominated by 
people of color when juxtaposed with his myriad 
of support from his white colleagues. A simple 
comparison of the Jaliscan shrimp taco to that 
of the Cantonese har gao merits a discussion 
of hierarchical race structures within the 
United States, similar to the exclusion of Black 
contributions in American barbecue within a 
barbecue episode exploring the differences of 
American and East Asian barbecue. For those 
familiar to Chang’s ideals and mannerisms, 
this may only seem as a thematic highlight to 
“Ugly Delicious” — Chang’s person is one that 
highlights his brutal honesty and pride toward 
his Asian American identity.
The premise of the first season of “Ugly 
Delicious” revolves around curiosity — a desire 
to learn about other food cultures that may not 
necessarily pertain with your own racial and 
ethnographic identity. But with the release of 
season two of “Ugly Delicious,” Chang shows 
remarkable growth as a host, perhaps even 
humility, that spans past his own identity and 
advances global questions within food. Season 
two tackles uncertainty and learning of food 
knowledge head-on in a way that wasn’t clearly 
addressed in season one.
The Season two premiere of “Ugly Delicious,” 
“Kids Menu,” delves into the deep end of 
Chang’s internal struggles with becoming a new 
father — one that he compares to his sentiments 
to his current “kids” of the Momofuku empire. 
Chang comes into full reckoning of his past 
achievements and temperament — his former 
methods and attitudes that 
aided him in his past won’t 
work when raising a child. 
Succinctly, Chang states, 
“There’s a big moment 
of reckoning right now 
between old Dave Chang 
and ‘Dad’ Dave Chang.”
In this sense, Chang’s 
introspection 
in 
“Kids 
Menu” sets the tone of 
the 
entirety 
of 
season 
two. 
In 
admitting 
his 
own ignorance and holes 
within his knowledge, he 
sets himself up as a host 
who puts aside much of 
his preconceived opinions 

and humbly listens to the knowledge of other 
food cuisines. Notably, Chang puts himself in 
the backseat rather than the foreground of the 
show, letting other cast members and cuisine 

experts of Indian, Turkish and Western steaks 
shine with their knowledge.
This isn’t to say that Chang doesn’t completely 
let go of his former somewhat abrasive 
demeanor that was on full display during the 
first season. Comedically, Chang savagely 
pokes holes within his lack of understanding, in 
particular to his ignorance towards Indian and 
Turkish cuisine. He also roasts individuals who 
like well-done steaks, though the show cautions 
with a caveat that consuming well-done steaks 
may have religious connotations.
While seasons one and two are presented 
as short, informative documentary essays, 
the second season is a far more cohesive and 
convincing one. Taking the best of season 
one — the concise, informative narrative of 
each episode — season two adds the voices of 
prominent PoC and Womxn voices within the 
food industry and criticism ranging from that 
of Floyd Cardoz, Lolis Eric Elie, Helen Rosner 
and Malakeh Jazmati. The further and wider 
addition of PoC entertainers such as David Choe 
provide additional levity as Chang allows his 
circle of colleagues and friends to share their 
own stories and perspectives as they conduct 
their own mini-interviews. Is the absence of 
Peter 
Meehan 
noticed? 
Yes, but the show doesn’t 
decrease its own presence 
or authority any less with 
its new Season. 
Through 
his 
inner 
turmoil 
and 
reflection 
throughout Season two of 
“Ugly Delicious,” David 
Chang ultimately becomes 
a better advocate for PoC 
and womxn voices in the 
food industry, simply by 
putting 
aside 
his 
ego, 
listening to others and 
allowing others to speak 
on his own platform.

TV REVIEW
MUSIC NOTEBOOK
What I’m listening to:
‘[USA]’ by Anamanaguchi

New York City 8-bit band Anamanaguchi 
doesn’t seem like a recipe for mass-appeal 
music. You can explain their genre by saying 
“If you like video games and anime, you’ll love 
Anamanaguchi.” But when I try to imagine 
a band that takes those mediums as its main 
influences — not to knock on video games 
and anime — I imagine niche tunes that only 
meganerds like myself would enjoy. Definitely 
not 
thoughtful, 
multilayered 
or 
widely 
appealing music. But [USA] is all of the above.
The album has been long in the making. 
The band first announced [USA] in November 
2014, promising a 2016 release date. They 
kept busy by releasing their own parody video 
game and headlining Minecraft music festivals 
(seriously). [USA] finally released in October 
2019.
I should have known Anamanaguchi was 
anything but one-dimensional. With electropop 
bangers like “Pop It” and “Miku” under their 
belt, they are so much more than gamer music. 
Their talent is beyond the confines of 8-bit pop, 
and so is [USA].
It’s popular to build an album around a sort 
of sonic journey, following the conventions of 
narrative — exposition, rising action, climax, 
falling action, resolution. That structure is 
audible in [USA], but not just across the album; 
every individual song has its own journey that 
takes you somewhere else. Take “Lorem Ipsum 
(Arctic Anthem).” Beginning with a synthetic 
voice singing the pseudo-Latin dummy text 
lyrics — “Lorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet” — 
the track continues to build with buried, bassy 
percussion before blasting into a chiptune 
explosion. Just as it seems the tension is easing, 
the song erupts into its high-pitched climax. 
The second half of the song is a chilling ambient 
cut. You can almost feel the wind and the waves 

of the arctic beneath the track. That’s the kind 
of transportive journey felt on every song.
Anamanaguchi builds a world with subtlety 
in [USA]. Like the wind and waves on “Lorem 
Ipsum (Arctic Anthem),” I feel the forest 
beneath “The C R T Woods.” I can imagine the 
mysterious creatures whose voices sing “Speak 
To You [Memory Messengers]” and “Apophenia 
Light [Name Eaters].” It’s no coincidence that 
the cover art depicts a weathered storybook 
over 
moss-covered 
cobblestones 
with 
a 
paintbrush beside it. [USA] is what a picture 
book would sound like as an audiobook, and 
Anamanaguchi is the narrator.
But is that [USA] picture book one of fantasy 
or reality? It’s easy to think it’s fantasy. After 
all, Anamanaguchi got its start in pioneering a 
combination of pop punk with chiptune music 
generated from Nintendo hardware (their 
earliest releases were actually on playable 
NES cartridges). Their next release was a 
soundtrack to the “Scott Pilgrim vs. The World” 
video game, and their debut record, funded via 
Kickstarter, is literally titled Endless Fantasy. 
But by the band’s own account, [USA] is about 
confronting reality. Band member Ary Warnaar 
says “[USA] is inspired by the struggles of 
acknowledging 
the 
distinction 
between 
(fantasy and reality) … a process so many of us 
seem to be undergoing.” The way [USA] deftly 
swings between adrenaline-infused excitement 
and moody, ambient melancholy is a reflection 
of reality.
The 
end 
result 
of 
that 
reality-based, 
storybook sound is a gratifying full-album 
experience — so much so that if I hear a song 
from [USA] on shuffle in a playlist, I get this 
weird sense of confusion from hearing it out 
of context. Despite how unique each track 
is, it’s easy to forget this record isn’t a single 
52-minute song. Anamanaguchi put their 
hearts into crafting that clean and cohesive 
a project. My fingers are crossed for a remix 
album down the line.

DAILY FOOD COLUMN
Food column: The best cheap(ish) eats in New York

Note: The following article should not be taken as 
a comprehensive guide of various restaurants within 
Manhattan or the Five Boroughs. This article simply 
showcases what the author has eaten within New 
York City over the course of a week. 
If you were to swipe through my smartphone, 
you would see tasting notes and observations of 
countless dishes alongside thousands of photos 
of said dishes. You might find that this massive 
collection of notes and photos from the past 
week relate almost exclusively to food ingested in 
Manhattan. Following my journey chronologically 
and with a fully loaded MetroCard, you may find 
yourself eating as follows: 
 
Meal 1: Momos at Mom’s Momos
Tired and fresh out of the LaGuardia Airport, 
you are bewildered when you find a food truck 
parked in front of a Wendy’s by Roosevelt Station in 
Jackson Heights. But the momos at Mom’s Momos 
are anything but bewildering — while not as heavily 
spiced as the momos you may find at Detroit’s Momo 
Cha, the spurting juices bursting out of the momo’s 
meatball bring waves of nostalgia and memories 
of consuming fresh Korean mandoo dumplings 
available a dime a dozen in the streets of Seoul.
 
Meal 2: Tacos and Mulas at Los Tacos No. 1 
Since when do they have mulas? You feel befuddled 
and betrayed. Mulas are the heartwarming, 
quesadilla-like sandwich alternatives to the taco. 
Los Tacos No. 1 distinguishes itself from the 
rest through its to-order corn/flour tortillas and 
adobada option — an earthier, somewhat spicier 
Tijuana inflection of al pastor, a dish derived from 
the shawarmas of Lebanese immigrants. With Los 
Tacos No. 1, you find that Manhattan does a good 
job catering to a homesick Angeleno. To round out 
your meal, a horchata may be more effective than a 
tamarindo, its thickness, creaminess and sweetness 
providing an ending counterpoint to your meal 
compared to the tangy tamarindo. 
 
Meal 3: Dakgalbi at Hong Chun Cheon
Joined by Senior News Editor Claire Hao and 
former Senior MiC Editor Sivanthy Vasanthan, 
you find yourself seated at a pojangmacha-style 
pub to eat dakgalbi — a spicy but sweet Korean 
stir-fried chicken not made with ribs as its name 
might suggest — is the obscure predecessor to the 
viral buldak. While not usually as spicy as its hip 
descendant, the inclusion of cabbage and additional 
rice cakes provides a comforting presence alongside 
the stretchy cheese. While the melted cheese 
and ever-reducing sauce nostalgically fills your 
stomach, you find that the lack of caramelization 

of the dakgalbi due to the induction stove (rather 
than a gas or charcoal stove) leaves your meal 
somewhat underwhelming. But perhaps you’re 
being overcritical — Claire says this is some of the 
best Korean food she’s ever had.
 
Meal 4: Bingsu at Grace Street
Bingsu is among the most popular summer 
desserts found in Koreatowns nationwide. Thin, 
ethereal flakes of shaved frozen sweet milk topped 
with all the toppings available to mankind, the 
traditional pairing of ground black sesame and 
misugaru (a blend of grounded grains) provides 
a savory backbone that prevents the sweet milky 
flavors from overwhelming you. Grace Street has 
its own New York presentation — a resplendent 
style that piles your shaved milk vertically and 
haphazardly in its very own fuck-you way. You’d 
never have it served like that anywhere else. It’s 
Manhattan.
 
Meal 5: Lobster Roll at Luke’s Lobster
After visiting Ellis Island and unable to go to 
Flushing, Claire wants to eat one American dish 
before going back to Michigan. A quick trip to 
Luke’s Lobster’s FiDi location provides a quick 
bite to eat before her flight. Perfectly cooked and 
lightly dressed lobster served on a mildly sweet roll 
of bread will have many mayonnaise-hating folks 
rejoicing over their lobster rolls, while ordering a 
crab version of the roll will present itself with the 
crab’s naturally slightly sweeter meat. Because the 
lobster is cooked so perfectly in your lobster roll, 
you’ll find that, in comparison, the lobster bisque is 
a little overcooked. 
 
Meal 6: Fish Tacos and Ceviche at Los 
Mariscos
The Baja California style of fried fish tacos served 
at Los Mariscos might put the fish and chips at 
many of London’s chippies to shame. You embrace 
the shattering crust of the fried fish alongside the 
familiar freshmade home tortilla identical to its 
sister restaurant Los Tacos No. 1. Given that Los 
Mariscos is a Baja Californian taqueria, you may be 
confused by the presence of aguachile, a Sinaloan 
specialty. You vow to go back again and try the 
aguachile with someone else, in part due to the 20 
dollar price tag and in part due to the sheer size of 
the dish. You almost forget to request a free cup 
of tomatoey shrimp broth to sip as you leave the 
restaurant.
 
Meal 7: Salmon Temaki (Hand Roll) at The 
Lobster Place
Would 
you 
have 
expected 
a 
gentrified 
marketplace in Chelsea to serve Japanese hand 
rolls? Tucked next to the regalia of American 
oysters is a small stall offering a no-frills, eat-and-
go temaki including spicy cooked shrimp for the 

sushi-adverse to fan favorites such as toro (fatty 
tuna belly) and uni (sea urchin roe). You find the 
seafood to be fresh enough, though what surprises 
you is the synergy amongst the clear, crisp bite 
of nori that gives into a complementary, non-
overwhelming nikiri sauce that provides the right 
amount of salinity towards your seafood of choice. 
 
Meal 8: Biangbiang Noodles at Very Tasty 
Noodle
Hand pulled noodles from Lanzhou are becoming 
more popular within Southeast Michigan (such as 
Lan City or Jiang Nan Noodle House), though the 
versions that are currently popular within New 
York are biangbiang noodles — rustic homestyle 
ripped noodles popularized by restaurants such as 
Xian’s Famous Foods. Biangbiang noodles originate 
from the Shaanxi province rather than Lanzhou, 
with a healthy mix of black vinegar, heat and cumin 
to coat your noodles and shredded lamb. Dine 
during the off hours of Very Tasty Noodles and 
you may witness the machismo manhood contest 
of trying to pull noodles solely with one hand — a 
feat achieved by coiling the dough around your 
arm before whipping the dough onto a surface with 
a resounding thwack. A line cook offers the idea 
of a one finger challenge, which is refuted with, 
“No, that’s stupid” from the head chef. You snort 
Szechuan peppercorns and cumin into your nostrils 
while laughing in agreement. The horchata at the 
nearby Los Tacos No.1 thankfully relieves the tingle 
and pain.
 
Meal 9: Chai at The Chai Spot
The menthol-like honeyed aroma of cardamom 
resounds over the licorice-like bass notes of the 
fennel in your standard, traditional chai at The 
Chai Spot. But the Double Tea, with its inclusion 
of jaggery sugar, rounds out a general astringency 
from the black tea that may be almost superior 
to their cardamom/fennel mix of the traditional 
chai. Those familiar with the overly-sweet chai 
monstrosities of Starbucks may want to lean 
towards the Butter Chai, which the baristas say 
tastes like a creamy cake.
 
Meal 10: Malecon Restaurant
Malecon is undoubtedly a master of Dominican 
roast chicken, as well as renditions of maduros 
and tostones — fried ripe and unripe plantains 
respectively. While the tostones, favored by fellow 
food columnist Eli Rallo, of Malecon may come out 
as more dry than fluffy, they provide an equally 
creamy and sweet interior with an underlying tang 
wrapped in a crispy exterior. While the french 
fry-esque tostones may be a natural partner to 
Malecon’s juicy chicken, you find yourself leaning 
more towards the maduros instead.
 
Meal 11: Fuzhou Noodles and Lychee Pork at 

Hong Man
Unless you are fluent in Fuzhounese or 
Mandarin, you might find that pointing to different 
portions of the menu is the most effective method 
of communication with the restaurant’s owner. 
Compared to the bombastic heat of northern 
Chinese cooking, Fuzhou noodles provide an 
intense gut-punching broth (whether that may be 
the wild aroma of rabbit or briny scent of shrimp) 
that simultaneously soothes and fills your stomach. 
A side order of Lychee pork, named after its 
resemblance to its namesake fruit, is the perfect 
sweet-and-sour, stir-fried complement to your 
humble bowl of noodles.
 
Meal 12: Cheesecake at Eileen’s Special 
Cheesecake
The Buzzfeed’s Worth It spotlight of Eileen’s 
Cheesecake does its best to approximate the 
seemingly contradictory nature of this cheesecake. 
While the expected creaminess of your standard 
New York cheesecake is present, it is the fluffy 
interior supplied by the merengue that juxtaposes 
with the richness of the cream cheese that 
surprises you with every bite. Eileen’s advertises 
the inclusion of lemon juice within their batter — 
the acidity of the batter lightens the cheesecake 
but somehow doesn’t infuse a citrus aroma. This is 
the sort of fancy cheesecake you would expect in 
a pricier establishment, yet served in a neighborly 
hole in the wall. 
 
Meal 13: Hong Kong Wonton Soup at Noodle 
Village
There are times when you crave the wonton soup 
found in Chinese American restaurants and buffets, 
and times when you crave the wonton soup found in 
Hong Kong. The broth of a Hong Kong wonton soup 
is filled with a coastal aroma, courtesy of a dried 
flounder soup base. The wonton soup at Noodle 
Village is no different — you are awash with a briny, 
oceanic background sprinkled with the spring bite 
of green onions. When you slurp in the wontons, 
you’ll find the slippery texture of the wonton dough 
pleasant as it slides through your mouth, revealing 
a bouncy and juicy pork and shrimp meatball hiding 
within.
 
Meal 14: Mochi Donuts at The Dough Club
Mochi donuts are the wildly popular Japanese 
donuts originating from the Japanese bakery Mr. 
Donuts. While the rendition that Sivanthy ordered 
retains much of the chewiness of a traditional mochi, 
the overtly thick, candy-like frosting overwhelms 
the otherwise light yet chewy texture of the donut. 
Some foods that seem cute and appetizing really do 
underwhelm sometimes.

LAMBERT FAMILY BOND

Codie Lambert peered over the bright 
yellow railings that separated her from 
the gathering hockey players.
Seven hundred ten miles from her 
hometown, she was standing in the 
bleachers, 
watching 
the 
Vernon 
Vipers line up for their pregame 
skate.
Codie had made the long trek all the 
way from Saskatoon, Saskatchwen to see 
her little brother, Jimmy, play hockey. 
Jimmy was all about surprises — he 
had a knack for unexpected scares or 
pranks — but this time, he was on the 
receiving end. All of it — the flight, 
the trek, her presence — was done 
in secret, intended as a surprise for 
him. The siblings hadn’t seen each 
other in a long time.
And that was tough. As much 
as hockey means to him, family 
means more. It’s everything. 
Through all the ups and downs 
in his life, they’ve been by his 
side and supported him no 
matter what.
Jimmy 
playing 
junior 
hockey in British Columbia 
— twelve hours from home — 
made it tough to see family. 
As he readied himself to 
step out onto the ice, his 
sister readied her phone and 
reached over the railing, 
wanting to capture his 
reaction on camera.
“Jimmy!” she called.
And it took him a 
minute to register that 
someone had called 
his name. When he 
turned to look up — 
his face a mixture 
of disbelief and 
joy — two words 
slipped out.
No way.
***

The first three years of his life, 
Jimmy spent in England where his dad, 
Dale, played in the British Professional 
League. He would go to every one of 
Dale’s games, sit on his mom Reina’s 
lap and clutch his baby blanket that he 
called Gigi in one hand. 
Pretty soon he traded the blanket in 
for a hockey stick and strapped on a pair 
of plastic rollerblades. At just three years 
old, Lambert would skate around the 
living room, body checking any piece of 
furniture — or wall — in sight. He’d even 
make the occasional sound effect. 
When Dale retired from playing 
and the family moved to Canada, he 
built Jimmy a backyard rink. It wasn’t 
anything fancy. Just two nets, some 
mock boards and a sheet of ice he’d flood 
every day.
Everyday, Lambert would be out in 
the backyard practicing. From sunup 
to sundown on the days he didn’t have 
school. He would’ve been out there 
every hour of the day if Dale and Reina 
would’ve allowed it.
And whenever he did something he 
found particularly cool or exciting — 
whether it was stopping and making the 
snow on the ice blow or scoring a sick 
goal — he’d run inside the house to share 
the news. He wanted his family to hear 
all about it.
“In his little squeaky voice he would 
come running into the house, ‘Mom! 
Mom! You’ve got to come see me, look 
what I did! Come here! Come here!”, 
Reina said. “My husband and I were just 
like ‘Oh my gosh, it’s your turn (to go 
see).’ ”
Hockey is one of the ways Lambert 
and his dad grew to be so close. Dale 
coached him when he was younger, 
and he credits his early development as 
a player to that. But having your dad a 
coach isn’t without its conflicts.
When Lambert was six, maybe seven, 
his team was playing in a tournament, 

MOLLY SHEA / Daily Sports Writer

and he was playing forward. The 
team had a big lead. Dale asked his 
son to stop shooting the puck, a show 
of respect for the opposing team but 
Jimmy didn’t listen. The very next 
shift, he skated over the boards and 
netted another goal. 
As he made his way to the bench, his 
dad asked him what part of no more 
shooting had he misunderstood. And 
on his next shift, he skated over to 
the parents section and yelled out 
to Reina, complaining that Dale had 
told him he couldn’t score anymore 
goals.
Sixteen years later, Lambert’s 
playing hockey in the Big Ten 
for Michigan. He achieved one 
of his biggest dreams. He knows 
exactly how lucky he is to have the 
opportunity to not only play, but to 
receive an education on scholarship.
Because as much as Lambert 
loves hockey, as much as every 
opportunity to lace up his skates and 
put on the Wolverine sweater means 
to him, his family still means more.
Lambert and his dad always talk 
hockey together. When he has a 
setback or he’s struggling with his 
game, Dale is his main confidant. 
That’s his department.
On the other side is Reina. That’s 
who Lambert calls whenever he’s 
stressed about school or anything 
non-hockey related. Academics are 
really important to him, he knows 
he has to get a degree so that there’s 
life after hockey.
And his mom’s always been a huge 
supporter of his schooling.
When Jimmy was in first grade, 
he started learning how to read. But 
it didn’t come naturally to him the 
way hockey had. He struggled, so 
the teacher approached Reina about 
sending him to the resource room 
during class reading time.
At first everything was going okay. 
Then one day Jimmy went to Reina 
and confessed he really disliked 
going to the resource teacher. Some 
of his classmates were teasing him, 
and his self-esteem was wavering.
So Reina did what any mom would 
do, and hired a local university 
student studying education to help 
with Jimmy’s reading. It enabled 
him to stay in the class during 
reading time, and pretty soon his 
reading skills took off. And so did 
his self-confidence.
After that, his grades really took 
off. In order to get into Michigan, 
he had to take a full year of college 
classes his last year of juniors. He 
knows the value of the 

degree too.
When he was in high school, he 
worked at a hardware store. He’d 
hall lumber in and out of people’s 
houses all day. Every day he’d come 
home absolutely exhausted. It was 
long hours. And that’s when he knew 
he needed a plan for life post hockey.
***
In the crowd at one of his BCHL 
games, Reina noticed a little boy.
He had a sign supporting Jimmy 
and was chanting his name. It was 
the first time she’d thought about 
how her son could be impacting and 
inspiring little kids. Above being 
a good hockey player or a good 
student, it’s important to her that 
Jimmy’s a good person.
Ask any of his teammates or 
coaches and they’ll confirm it. He’s 
always trying to put a smile on 
their faces. Always working hard. 
Bringing a positive attitude.
And 
the 
occasional 
practical 
joke. Sometimes he’ll Saran Wrap a 
toilet seat. Lately, he’s been scaring 
people. His main targets are his 
housemates — particularly captain 
Will Lockwood.
“He scared me once when I was 
coming out of Yost,” Lockwood 
said. “It’s been a funny little thing 
going on at our house. He’ll hide in 
the corner, hide in the cracks of the 
basement and pop out and scare us. 
I know he got (Luke) Martin really 
good the other night, and he’ll 
videotape it so you can kinda see the 
reactions.”
Lambert’s teammates are a family 
away from home.
Back in Canada, he’s got his two 
sisters. Codie, and a younger sister 
named Cadie, making him the 
middle child. So while Codie was 
making him play house and be her 
baby — something Lambert admits 
he was pretty compliant to do — he 
was strapping pillows to Cadie and 
having her play goalie.
But beyond just playing together, 
Lambert and his siblings have a 
strong relationship. They talk at 
least once or twice a week, every day 
if you count Snapchat. 
When Codie was younger, she 
had a room downstairs. She was too 
afraid to sleep in the room alone, so 
Jimmy would stay with her. That 
made her susceptible to his pranking.
On April Fools, he’d put mustard 
in their toothpaste. Salt on their 
toothbrushes. Draw on their faces 
with markers. Sleep didn’t offer 
them safety either. Jimmy would 

wake them up just to scare them.
It wasn’t ever in a mean-spirited 
way though. 
“I’m always looking to get a smile 
out of someone,” Lambert said. “ … 
You never know someone might be 
having a little bit of a rough day, and 
if you can cheer them up by scaring 
them or giving them a little bit of a 
prank I think it could be good for 
someone.”
As uncommon as it was for 
Lambert to see his family while he 
was playing junior hockey, it’s even 
more so now. The closest 
Big 
Ten 
school 
to 
Saskatoon 
is 
Minnesota 
and 
even that’s 12 
hours 
away. 
Last year the 
family 
made 
the trip, this 
year 
they 
didn’t because 
Jimmy 
was 
out with an 
injury.
He didn’t go 
home last summer. 
He remained in Ann 
Arbor 
to 
practice 
hockey. Other than 
that, he comes home 
for five days during 
Christmas now. And 
having him home 
makes 
the 
family 
complete.
He’s a peacekeeper. 
When 
everyone’s 
gathered 
around 
the 
dinner table talking and 
an argument breaks out, 
he’s the first to interject. But 
not with a combative reply. 
Instead, he deescalates the 
situation. Asking his family 
members to really think about 
the situation and if it really 
matters that much.
Lambert’s 
always 
been the type to look 
on the positive side of 
things. In hockey when 
he’s had his struggles, 
he’s never let them get 
too far under his skin. 
“I always tell myself 
it’ll work its way out,” 
Lambert said. “If 
something’s 
not going 
right, 
just 

stick to it. Keep my nose to the 
grindstone and just always push 
forward. Never look back. What’s in 
front of me is a fresh ground and it’s 
only up to me to shape it. If I can just 
make sure that I’m always battling, 
no matter what, if it’s going well or 
if it’s going bad, just keep looking 
forward and just always battle 
through it.”
This positive mentality comes 
from his parents. Lambert uses 
them as role models for how to deal 
with hardships. He knows whenever 
something didn’t go their way, 
they kept at it. They worked 
hard. And they continued to 
work even when it wasn’t 
giving the results they 
wanted. That’s exactly what 
he did last year, and during 
his time in juniors when 

his hockey wasn’t going how he 
wanted.
It’s obvious family means a great 
deal to him. He proudly talks about 
the accomplishments of his sisters, 
and they share the same sentiment 
towards his achievements. 
Distance doesn’t affect the family’s 
bond. They’ve got a group chat, 
and it’s always buzzing. Whether 
it’s someone asking what everyone 
wants for dinner or someone’s 
sending pictures of the three pets, 
they’re always keeping up to date 
with each other.
“They’ve supported me so much 
through 
everything,” 
Lambert 
said. “Definitely can’t thank them 
enough. I definitely won’t be able to 
repay them for everything they’ve 
done for me that’s for sure.”
So no matter what happens with 
hockey, 
Lambert’s 
family 
will 
always have his back — and he’ll 
have theirs.

THE END

Give seniors an 
extra year of play
T

he unthinkable has hap-
pened. 
Thursday, when the 
NCAA announced that the men’s 
and women’s 
basketball 
tournaments 
would be 
cancelled due 
to COVID-
19, the 
college bas-
ketball world 
responded 
with shock, 
frustration, 
anger and 
just about everything in between. 
Sports fans across the country 
— myself included — will have to 
come to grips with the fact that 
one of our greatest annual tradi-
tions is no more. Losing March 
Madness won’t be easy for any-
one. 
But none of us can relate to 
what the players, especially 
seniors, are feeling. 
For many of them, the tourna-
ment was going to be the end of 
their basketball careers — a grand 
finale of sorts. Just 0.9 percent of 
women’s and 1.1 percent of men’s 
basketball players make the leap 
from college to the professional 
level. For the other 99 percent, the 
NCAA Tournament is the biggest 
sporting event they’ll ever have 
the chance to play in. To have that 
stolen from them is downright 
criminal. 
To be clear, it was absolutely 
necessary to cancel the tourna-
ment. The safety of the players 
and coaches must come first, 
and the COVID-19 has reached a 
point where half-baked efforts to 
contain it won’t work. The NCAA 
acted in the best interests of its 
athletes in this one case. 
Now, it must do it again. 
Those seniors who have been 
robbed of the opportunity of a 
lifetime deserve another shot. 
They deserve an extra year of 
eligibility. 
Yes, this would be unprec-
edented. It’s a lot to ask the NCAA 
— an organization that doesn’t 
consider being close to a sick fam-
ily member as a valid reason for 
immediate transfer eligibility — to 
just give an extra year to hun-
dreds of athletes. 
But everything about this is 
unprecedented. March Madness 
has never been cancelled. We’re in 
the middle of a global pandemic. 
Now is not the time to worry 
about what’s been done before. It’s 
time to do the right thing for these 
athletes.
The specifics would admittedly 
be complicated. With new play-
ers coming in, teams across the 
country would exceed the current 
scholarship limit of 13. The NCAA 
could expand that for one season, 
but that brings up questions of 
equity. Would it be fair to teams 
that had few or no seniors this 
year? A potential solution could be 
a mandatory redshirt rule to keep 
rosters at the same size, but the 
specifics of that itself would have 

to be ironed out. 
For Michigan, there are two 
seniors on both the women’s and 
men’s teams. The women’s team 
would certainly benefit from 
having forward Kayla Robbins 
back after she missed most of Big 
Ten play with a torn ACL, and 
there’s no doubt she’d be thrilled 
to return to her teammates for 
another year. We know her co-
captain — senior guard Akienreh 
Johnson — wants to come back, as 
the team has already petitioned 
for another year of eligibility for 
her. 
And on the men’s side, though 
there’s no guarantee guard Zavier 
Simpson and center Jon Teske 
would choose to come back for 
another season, they deserve the 
right to make that decision for 
themselves. That’s the case for 
a number of players across the 
country — Cassius Winston isn’t 
returning to Michigan State, and 
Sabrina Ionescu isn’t going back 
to Oregon. 
But I can’t speak for what play-
ers across the country would want 
or what’s best for them. 
So just ask their coaches.
“Seniors, if they want, should 
have another year,” Oklahoma 
State men’s basketball coach Mike 
Boynton told Jeff Goodman of 
Stadium. “Special permission 
on scholarship numbers for an 
unprecedented circumstance. 
Next year only.”
Mid-major schools have it 
worse. While making the tourna-
ment is an expectation for the 
Dukes and Kansases of the world, 
it’s life-changing for schools like 
East Tennessee State, whose 
men’s team had just punched its 
ticket after winning the Southern 
Conference Tournament. 
“I’m heartbroken for everyone 
associated with our program, 
especially our five seniors,” ETSU 
coach Steve Forbes told Good-
man. “These young men have 
dedicated their lives to have the 
opportunity to represent ETSU in 
the NCAA Tournament, and it’s 
been taken away from them at no 
fault of their own.
“While I wholeheartedly sup-
port this decision, I will make it 
my mission to fight for another 
year of eligibility for our five 
seniors so they have the oppor-
tunity to once again turn their 
dreams into reality.”
It’s heartbreaking across the 
board. After years of dedication, 
athletes came within inches 
of their dreams, only to have it 
snatched away at the last minute. 
Yes, COVID-19 is bigger than 
sports. It’s bigger than all of us. 
But that doesn’t make its 
smaller-level impacts any less 
important. The NCAA has a 
unique opportunity to erase just a 
little bit of the damage it’s done to 
college athletes. 
And I can’t see any reason why 
it shouldn’t.

Is it wrong to care about sports?
T

hursday, New York 
City declared a state of 
emer-
gency to 
fight a global 
pandemic; 
the Dow 
dropped 10 
percent, its 
worst single-
day drop 
since the 
crash of 1987; 
millions of 
Americans 
are indefinitely hunkered 
down in self-quarantine; Don-
ald Trump said domestic travel 
could soon be curtailed; and 
colleges stopped playing sports 
for awhile.
One of those plainly doesn’t 
belong with the others, and yet 
it will be the subject of this col-
umn because, well, this is The 
Michigan Daily sports section 
— and because I’m confused as 
hell. We all are. 
The NCAA released a state-
ment Thursday afternoon 
confirming what had rapidly 
become inevitable: The NCAA 
Tournament will not happen, 
nor will the remainder of win-
ter or spring sports.
“While I understand how 
disappointing this is for all 
fans of our sports, my decision 
is based on the current under-
standing of how COVID-19 
is progressing in the United 
States,” NCAA President Mark 
Emmert wrote. “This decision 
is in the best interest of public 
health, including that of coach-
es, administrators, fans and, 
most importantly, our student-

athletes.”
The NCAA joined all the 
professional leagues (sans 
NASCAR and the PGA Tour) in 
shutting things down for now. 
Michigan athletic director 
Warde Manuel released a state-
ment shortly after Emmert’s:
“Today we took the unprec-
edented and proactive deci-
sion to suspend intercollegiate 
activities to protect the health 
and well-being of our student-
athletes, staff and commu-
nity members,” 
Manuel said. 
“This deci-
sion reached in 
collaboration 
with the Big 
Ten conference 
and campus 
leaders, was 
reached after 
thorough dis-
cussion and 
was necessary 
given the magnitude of this 
global issue. The hard work 
and dedication of our student-
athletes, coaches and staff 
is a source of inspiration for 
so many. So, too, will be our 
response as we confront this 
global pandemic.”
This, of course, really sucks.
The NCAA Tournament is 
my favorite sporting event of 
the year. I was downright giddy 
to go cover the Big Ten Tourna-
ment this weekend. But there’s 
no debating these details 
anymore. Cancel everything, 
sports being the low-hanging 
fruit. As men’s basketball coach 
Juwan Howard put it in a state-
ment: “Some things are bigger 

than basketball.”
That’s not the question 
worth considering anymore. 
There was one right answer; 
the NCAA, the Big Ten and 
Michigan — belatedly — made 
it. 
But is it wrong to bemoan 
the premature ending to the 
careers of Jon Teske and Zavier 
Simpson, the two winningest 
men’s basketball players in 
Michigan history? Is it insen-
sitive, amid economic chaos 
and worldwide 
panic, to feel 
cheated we don’t 
get to see if the 
Michigan base-
ball program 
can build on last 
year’s success? 
A year of Carol 
Hutchins’s illus-
trious career, 
her 34th, flushed 
away? What 
about Mel Pearson’s suddenly 
red-hot team, stomping its way 
into the Big Ten Tournament 
semifinals? Kim Barnes Arico 
and her short-handed, resilient 
squad? And those Michigan 
wrestlers who sacrificed every-
thing, redshirted the season, 
just to take their shot at an 
Olympic games that might no 
longer happen? 
Is it wrong right now, amid 
a world bursting at its seams, 
to care about sports? Can we 
truly compartmentalize these 
myopic misfortunes with the 
broader disaster?
Sports exist as a respite from 
the real world, and when that 
respite disappears, our daily 

lives suffer. The disappearance 
of sports, more than anything, 
will symbolize a disruption 
to structure and consistency. 
When that erodes, our morale 
will drop, our sense of collec-
tivity will slowly dissipate, our 
mental health will deteriorate. 
None of that should be dimin-
ished.
We are entering uncharted 
territory, a world in which we 
confront how deeply ingrained 
the culture of sports is in the 
ethos of this country — how 
much sports really do matter. 
I’m not sure we are completely 
prepared to discover that 
answer.
There are, to be clear, issues 
far more pressing right now — 
issues of life and death. Things 
are about to get much worse 
before they get any better. It 
appears we are entering an 
economic tailspin. Cases of 
COVID-19 are exploding by 
the day. The response at this 
point is reactive rather than 
proactive. And this country 
is still run by a narcissistic, 
incompetent human. Which is 
to say: These are truly terrify-
ing times. I am scared. And in 
the grand scheme of those wor-
ries, not being able to watch an 
NBA game on a random Tues-
day night is an inconsequential 
price to pay.
I don’t know whether it’s 
wrong to care about sports 
right now. But I sure know I’m 
going to miss them.

NCAA WINTER, SPRING SEASONS CANCELED DUE TO COVID-19 OUTBREAK

Hutchins reacts to decision: ‘It’s the worst day’

In the middle of Thursday’s 
practice, 
Carol 
Hutchins’ 
phone rang. 
It was Michigan Athletic 
Director Warde Manuel. 
Right away, Hutchins knew 
the phone call wouldn’t be an 
easy one. 
She was cognizant of the 
other 
mandates 
that 
had 
trickled in across the collegiate 
landscape throughout the day 
— the PAC-12 and ACC had both 
cancelled all sporting events 
until further notice. So when 
Manuel called, Hutchins knew 
what was coming. 
Manuel’s words, a message 
relayed from NCAA President 
Mark Emmert, only confirmed 
what had grown to be the 
inevitable. Due to the COVID-
19 pandemic, all remaining 
NCAA 
winter 
and 
spring 
championships were cancelled 
— softball included. 
Her players, in an act of 
blissful ignorance, continued 
practice as Hutchins digested 
the news. It was her job to break 
it to them. The news that this 
would be their last gathering, 
that their season was over 23 
games in and at least 30 short. 
She stopped practice and 
pulled her team into their home 
dugout, symbolically a place of 
comfort and unity amidst the 
trying times. A dugout that 
Hutchins calls “her favorite 
place in the world,” a dugout 
those same players wouldn’t be 
able to convene in as one ever 
again.
It was an all-too fitting 
place to cling to whatever last 
semblance of normalcy was 
left. 
The team was ready for her. 
And so Hutchins embarked 
on what she described as the 

hardest thing she’s ever had to 
do as a coach.
“It’s just the worst day of 
every coach’s career right now, 
telling their student athletes 
that they’re done,” Hutchins 
told The Daily. “Probably the 
hardest day is the last day of 
the year and you close your last 
game. But all 36 of my last days 
have never compared to this.
“And it’s for every student 
athlete in the country. Every 
student athlete is affected, all 
the support people. Even my 
managers were crying. They’ve 
worked so hard. Everybody’s in 
this together. It’s really hard 
to put in perspective. Today’s 
a tragedy, in another day this 
will be a new normal.”
For the seniors, the news 
rung 
especially 
harrowing. 
Two days before Saturday, 
what was meant to be their 
final home opener, their days 
as collegiate athletes have been 

cut short. 
Outfielder 
Haley 
Hoogenraad, outfielder Thais 
Gonzalez, infielder Madison 
Uden and catcher Abby Skvarce 
are finished donning the maize 
and blue for Michigan softball. 
“I just hugged them and told 
them and that I was proud of 
them,” Hutchins said. “They 
were a great senior class. They 
came a long way from being 
freshmen and that’s ultimately 
how you judge people. I’m very 
proud of those four. They were 
doing a great job leading us, 
getting through our ups and 
downs. I was really proud of 
them and that’s all I can tell 
them. My heart breaks most for 
them.”
For the players, uncertainty 
lies ahead. Hutchins doesn’t 
know how much longer they 
will be on campus. No one 
knows much about anything 
in a situation so fluid and 

unparalleled. So as Thursday’s 
practice 
culminated 
and 
the 
news 
reverberated 
in 
shockwaves, 
the 
team 
did 
all they could in such an 
overwhelming moment — rely 
on each other. 
“I know my team will be 
together,” Hutchins said. “I’m 
most concerned for those kids 
right now. What they need 
more than anything is to be 
with each other. We need to be 
together, that’s what we can do 
in times of grief.”
While 
the 
situation 
is 
unprecedented, Hutchins has 
no doubt her team will handle 
it with grace. 
“Our kids are well-equipped. 
They deal with adversity all 
the time. They deal with loss, 
they deal with failure. The 
most important thing they’ve 
learned is it’s not if you fall 
down, it’s if you get up. Our kids 
will get up. They’ll be strong.”
