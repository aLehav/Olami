Lecturers’ union to bring 
contract forward for vote

U-M offers LEO 
higher equity, pay in 
3-year agreement

By ALICE TRACEY

Summer Daily News Editor

The 
Lecturers 
Employee 
Organization announced today 
they had come to an agreement 
with the University, following 
months 
of 
negotiation 
and 
numerous bargaining sessions 
with the University over the 
past three days.
According to LEO, the union 
bargaining team has negotiated 
an 
agreement 
with 
the 
University that will raise pay, 
improve health care and boost 
job security.
“This is a huge victory for 
our members, it is equally a 
win for the University and our 
students,” Kirsten Herold, a 
lecturer at the U-M School 
of Public Health, LEO Vice 

President and manager of the 
LEO 
bargaining 
team 
said 
in a press release from LEO. 
“Higher pay will lead to less 
turn-over, 
more 
lecturers 
working fulltime — rather than 
holding multiple part-time jobs 
— and a more stable learning 
environment for our students 
to whom our membership are 
so dedicated.”
After 
meeting 
with 
University 
of 
Michigan 
administration representatives 
for 
bargaining 
sessions 
on 
Wednesday, 
June 
20 
and 
Friday, June 22, the union of 
about 1,700 non-tenured U-M 
faculty, will present a newly 
proposed three-year contract 
to its members for a ratification 
vote. 
LEO’s 
last 
contract 
expired May 29, and since the 
beginning of the last academic 
year, LEO has been pushing for 
higher wages, improved equity 
increases and a more even 
distribution of resources across 
the three U-M campuses to be 

included in the next contract.
This is the first contract 
proposal LEO leaders have 
deemed 
satisfactory 
enough 
to bring forward for a vote. 
After three years, the contract 
would raise minimum salary 
by $16,500 in Ann Arbor, 
$13,700 in Flint and $12,700 in 
Dearborn. The minimums are 
currently $34,500, $27,300 and 
$28,300 in Ann Arbor, Flint 
and 
Dearborn, 
respectively. 
Equity adjustments, or one-
time additions to base pay, 
would also increase and would 
range between $3,000 and 
$12,500, though equity would 
differ slightly for lecturers 
making over $80,000 annually. 
According to a LEO press 
release, the contract would 
provide 
additional 
benefits, 
increasing 
health 
coverage 
access 
and 
changing 
the 
University’s 
performance 
review 
protocol 
to 
protect 
lecturers’ jobs.

Applications 
hit record high

Over 65,500 students 
apply for admission

By KATHERINA SOURINE

Daily Staff Reporter

As 
summer 
begins, 
more 
than 
6,000 incoming freshmen have started 
preparing for their first year at the 
University of Michigan, which received 
a record number of applications this 
year.
More 
than 
65,500 
applications 
were reviewed and processed by the 
Office of Undergraduate Admissions, 
a 10.6-percent increase from last year’s 
59,407 applications, according to the 
University’s Office of Public Affairs. 
More than 15,400 students were offered 
admission, generating an acceptance 
rate of 23.5 percent.
Of the applications submitted, 12,521 
were submitted by in-state students and 
44,014 were received out-of-state, while 
9,149 were international.
Incoming freshman Dale Hendershot 
explained he found the process of 
applying to the University a smooth 
one, thanks to the straightforward 
nature of the Common Application. 
However, Hendershot did find the 
growing popularity and competition 
of the University relatively stressful, 
especially as an in-state student.
“Wondering 
if 
the 
years 
of 
preparation were good enough to be 
accepted into a top college like Michigan 
did whittle away at my sanity every once 
in a while,” he said. “Not knowing how 
I compared to other applicants certainly 
intensified 
this 
feeling. 
Looking 
forward, I am excited to confront college 
life head on and to explore my newfound 
independence and campus.”
Having just graduated from this 
year, U-M alum Alondra Vergara-Diaz 
expressed her appreciation for her time 
at the University and acknowledged 
admissions 
will 
become 
more 
competitive.

Ward 1 reps sue city 
over $10 million deal

Councilmembers 
claim Mayor, City 
Clerk violated charter

By ALICE TRACEY

Summer Daily News Editor

Ann Arbor City Councilmembers 
Sumi Kailasapathy, D-Ward 1, and 
Anne Bannister, D-Ward 1, have 
sued the city of Ann Arbor, Mayor 
Christopher Taylor and City Clerk 
Jacqueline Beaudry over a $10 million 
deal regarding the development of 
Library Lot. The contract, signed by 
Taylor, Beaudry and Chicago-based 
developer Core Spaces on May 31, 
hands over the development rights 
of Library Lot, a parking area next to 
the Ann Arbor District Library where 
Core Spaces plans to construct a 
17-story high-rise called the Collective.
Attorney Eric Lipson filed the 
lawsuit on behalf of Kailasapathy and 
Bannister June 18 in the Washtenaw 
County Trial Court. The lawsuit 
accuses Taylor and Beaudry of 
violating Ann Arbor’s charter by 
signing 
a 
development 
contract 

without first consulting City Council. 
The council voted 8-3 to sell Library 
Lot in April 2017 to Core Spaces, but 
the purchase was not finalized until 
this year. The lawsuit claims the May 
31 contract finalizing the purchase was 
not presented to City Council.
According to Kailasapathy, the 
Ann Arbor City Charter requires 
purchases or sales valued over 
$25,000 to be approved by at least 
eight councilmembers. She said the 
language of the charter is clear and 
she therefore feels confident about the 
strength of her and Bannister’s case.
“In plain English, it says a contract 
has to come, and there’s no way they 
can say there was a contract 13 months 
before because there was no contract, 
there was a resolution,” Kailasapathy 
said.
Kailasapathy claimed she and 
Bannister sued the city to protect the 
interests of their constituents. Ann 
Arbor voters trust the City Council 
to 
represent 
their 
interests, 
Kailasapathy said, so the council 
must get a say in financial decisions.

Argus Farm Stop 
pioneers new 
business model

By SONIA LEE

Daily Staff Reporter

Argus Farm Stop, an Ann 
Arbor small business focused on 
providing sustainable food for 
the community while supporting 
local Michigan farms, has proven 
a successful experiment in helping 
both consumers and producers in 
the communal food system. 
Founded by Ross M.B.A.s Bill 
Brinkerhoff and Kathy Sample in 
2014, Argus Farm Stop is a grocery 
store and cafe styled as a farmers’ 
market. The market applies a 
new business model, allowing 
customers to buy produce, dairy 
products 
and 
meats 
directly 
from local farmers. With the 
knowledge that farmers’ markets, 
while having good intentions, are 
often inefficient marketplaces for 
both consumers and producers, 
Brinkerhoff and Sample found a 
need in the Ann Arbor community 
Argus could solve.
“We knew a lot about local 
agriculture because we always 
shop at the farmers’ market,” 
Sample said. “We knew that 
farmers’ markets are a really hard 
way for farmers to sell their stuff. 
It’s a great community thing, but 
it’s a really hard way to sell because 
on a nice day they might rather be 
out on their farms.”

Brinkerhoff and Sample were 
inspired to start Argus after 
visiting a similar market and cafe 
in Ohio. Part of their business 
model included allowing farmers 
to 
make 
deliveries 
of 
fresh 
produce, meat and dairy products 
to the farm stop at any time on any 
day, softening time constraints 
attached to traditional farmers’ 
markets, as well as eliminating the 
need for a middle man.
“We were down in Wooster, 
Ohio, and we saw this store called 
Local Roots that had this new 
model that was an every-day 
farmers’ 
market,” 
Brinkerhoff 
said. “Where the farmers could 
just drop off their stuff and go back 
to their farm. We came back to Ann 
Arbor with the idea and talked 
to lots of people, and there was a 
consensus that there was a strong 
need in our community to further 
make local food economically 
sustainable 
for 
farmers 
and 
available to consumers.”
The business model prioritizes 
bringing a majority of profits back 
to producers. Argus maintains 
itself as a low-profit limited 
liability company, which makes 
this model sustainable, Sample 
explained.
“If they [local farms] were to 
sell through a traditional retailer, 
like a grocery store, they would 
get around 16 cents on the dollar of

City faces legal costs for

Gelman dioxane plume 

Contract with law 
firm now $445,000

By RACHEL CUNNINGHAM

Summer Daily News Editor

Ann Arbor City Council will 
see an increase in legal costs 
regarding clean-up efforts of 
the 1,4 dioxane plume con-
taminating the area’s ground-
water.
1,4 dioxane is a carcinogen-
ic organic compound used in 
many industrial settings. The 
plume was discovered after 
inspections revealed years of 
improper wastewater dispos-
al by Gelman Sciences Inc., 
an Ann Arbor-based manu-
facturing company. There are 
fears that the plume could 
spread to the Huron River and 
Barton Pond, two main water 
sources for the city.
The 
city 
approved 
an 
$150,000 increase to its con-
tract with Bodman PLC, a 
Detroit-based law firm, in the 
fight against Gelman to clean 
up the plume.
Councilmember Jack Eaton, 
D-Ward 4, feels the council’s 
involvement in the manner 
helps residents understand 
the precedence and severity 
of the issue.
“The important part of the 
state litigation that we’re now 
a party to is that it provides 
public information about the 
spread of the plume and how 
contaminated water is as it 
spreads underneath the (sur-
face),” Eaton said. “We will 
be at the table and able to get 
a voice about the decimating 
that kind of information.”
Councilmember 
Chip 
Smith, D-Ward 5, feels that 
added expenses will also be 
more efficient than relying 
on the federal government to 
help.
“It’s an expensive legal 
cost but I think the cost of 
not doing anything is so much 
greater,” Smith said. “The 
EPA is not going to come in 
and help us. To put our faith 
in the EPA of Scott Pruitt is 
wholly ignorant.”
According to Eaton, state 
regulations have only allowed 

for mitigation by the state 
instead of more stringent 
intervention and clean up. 
Standards on healthy dioxane 
levels in residential drink-
ing water were also outdated 
when previous water testing 
took place, therefore allow-
ing unsafe water to be used 
in residential homes. The 
governor’s office lowered the 
acceptable standards from 85 
parts per billion to 7.2 parts 
per billion in 2016.
Eaton says are residents 
do not believe the city has 
addressed the plume ade-
quately.
“I think the residents of 
Ann Arbor are concerned that 
we haven’t done enough over 
the years,” Eaton said. “This 
has gone on for decades. The 
state has been really cevile 
[COPY: servile?] in its efforts 
to address this and the city 
hasn’t been a party to this and 
hasn’t aggressively pursued 
any action against the com-
pany.”
The city wants the company 
to be held fully responsible for 
the costs and clean-up efforts.
The 
U.S. 
Environmental 
Protection Agency initially 
held off on designating the 
plume as a federal Superfund 
site, but has been working 
with city and state officials 
to resolve the issue. This 
came after an area petition 
by Ann Arbor Township, Scio 
Township and the Sierra Club 
Huron Valley Group was sent 
to the EPA to designate the 
site as a Superfund zone. The 
city of Ann Arbor did not join 
this petition.
“As the largest municipal-
ity in the area affected by 
the plume, it just seems like 
we would take a leadership 
role and we didn’t,” Eaton 
said. “Nonetheless, the EPA 
is now monitoring the litiga-
tion between the state and 
the polluter and we hope that 
in some point in time they 
become convinced that they 
should be ordering actual 
cleanup.”

The Daily sits down with candidate 
for governer Shri Thanedar

By GRACE KAY 

Summer Managing News Editor 

By RACHEL CUNNINGHAM 

Summer Daily News Editor 

Editor’s Note: The Michigan 
Daily does not officially endorse 
Shri Thanedar for governor. The 
Daily continues to reach out to 
other gubernatorial candidates for 
comments and interviews.
The Michigan Daily recently 
met with gubernatorial candi-
date Shri Thanedar to discuss his 
platform and goals for Michigan 
if elected governor. An Indian-
born entrepreneur, Thanedar is 
running against former state Sen. 
Gretchen Whitmer and Univer-
sity alum Abdul El-Sayed for the 
Democratic candidacy. The pri-
mary election is set to take place 
Aug. 7.
Thanedar says he is unlike any 
other candidate running for gov-
ernor in Michigan. He doesn’t 
come from a family of wealth and 
opulence, and he doesn’t look or 
talk like any of the other candi-
dates. He is an entrepreneur who 
came to the United States with 
$16 in his pocket and eventually 
worked to build a multimillion 
dollar business. 
Ultimately, Thanedar argues 
his knowledge, work ethic and 
life experiences make him the 
candidate Michigan needs.
“I look different. I don’t look 
like the past governors. I’m an 
immigrant,” Thanedar said. “I 
think I’m the only immigrant 
that’s running for governor. I 
speak differently more than 
most people in Michigan. But my 

point is that say four years from 
now I write my State of the State 
address and I’m talking about 
taking our education to the next 
level, fixing the roads and we 
are approaching near the Top 10 
… would it matter where I was 
born? Would it matter in what 
accent I said those words? That’s 
what I want Michiganders to 
remember when they go to vote 
on Aug. 7. Any Democrat that is 
‘good enough’ isn’t good enough.”
Thanedar runs a progressive 
platform
If elected as the governor of 
Michigan, Thanedar plans to 
make education his top priority.
“I want to be known as the 
education governor Michigan 
never had because education is 
important to me,” Thanedar said. 
“These are not just talking points, 
I draw them from my experiences 
of life. So when I talk about edu-
cation and why education needs 
to be improved, education was 
the ladder for me to pull myself 
out of poverty.
Thanedar 
also 
plans 
to 
increase the minimum wage, cre-
ate a skilled work force and mod-
ify the tax structure.
“One of the more unusual fea-
tures of my tax structure is that 
I will have any family that makes 
$50,000 or less state income 
tax exempt; they will not pay 
income tax,” Thanedar said when 
explaining key changes he would 
implement as governor. “I will 
raise the minimum wage to $15 
and tie it to inflation.”
Working with Republicans at 
the state level
Thanedar says when it comes 

to working with people who 
share different viewpoints and 
perspectives, he is open to new 
ideas and willing to work with 
those he may not always agree 
with.
“Somebody who has complete-
ly opposite views from me, we 
start talking and I’m open to new 
ideas, that’s who I am,” Thane-
dar said. “I have very thick skin. 
I don’t ever tweet at 3 A.M. in the 
morning. I can listen to differ-
ent viewpoints. I have run small 
businesses. I have dealt with 
teams; I’ve worked with teams. 
I’m used to this kind of openness 
and bouncing off things and look-
ing at both sides of the issue, so I 
think I’d work well.”
Thanedar believes with his 
experience as a business owner 
he could work well with mem-
bers of the Republican party at 
the state level.
“I think they would respect me 
because I’m not just talking when 
I talk about business, when I talk 
about finance, when I talk about 
jobs,” Thanedar said. “I’ve come 
from experience and I think I 
will get the respect that the other 
candidates may not get because 
I’m an entrepreneur, I’m a busi-
ness person. When I talk about 
finance I understand finance. It’s 
not something I memorized from 
somewhere.”
Setting himself apart from the 
other Democratic candidates
Thanedar explains the role 
of governor is about much more 
than giving poetic speeches.

OPINION

420 Maynard St. 
Ann Arbor, MI 48109
 tothedaily@michigandaily.com

Edited and managed by students at 
the University of Michigan since 1890.

I 

asked my big sister and 
former Division I collegiate 
soccer player if her school 
treated her the same as her male 
counterparts. 
Her 
response: 
“Students and fellow athletes 
do not treat me the same. They 
made comments about women’s 
sports being less important.” 
My sister is putting in the same 
amount 
of 
work, 
sacrificing 
the same amount of time and 
working through many of the 
same issues that all college 
athletes face and it seems like 
she gets no respect. This attitude 
toward women’s sports creates 
an almost hypocritical view of 
athleticism as “less-than” solely 
because the athlete is female. 
What qualifies men’s sports as 
holding any kind of importance? 
How can the same exact thing 
be any less significant simply 
because women are doing it?
Women’s sports are not less 
important. Women are not less 
important. Let’s remember that 
countless female athletes are 
putting in the same amount, 
if not more work as their male 
counterparts. Not to mention the 
fact that male athletes should 
be the first to support female 
athletes. They know just how 
much work has to be put in, 
just how much time has to be 
sacrificed and how grueling the 
life of a collegiate or professional 
athlete can be. Male athletes 
should not be the first to put 
their female counterparts down. 
Rather, they should be the first to 

be fighting for equality, fighting 
for justice.
I then asked one of my best 
friends, a Division I men’s college 
basketball player, if he ever feels 
like he’s given advantages over 
his female counterparts. “No,” 
he replied. “The only difference 
is the popularity of the sport. 
That’s not them getting treated 
differently, it’s just the way the 
world works.” Just the way the 
world works. Women just don’t get 
the respect they deserve. That’s 
just how it works. Female athletes 
are constantly given consolation 
prizes for competing in what’s 
seen as a men’s world. Just the 
way the world works. Now I know 
that my friend doesn’t really think 
female athletes deserve less than 
male athletes. I know because I 
spent four years of high school 
playing basketball alongside him 
and I know he respects me as an 
athlete. I also know he respects 
the women’s team at his college 
as well, but sometimes that can be 
harder to tell.
There have been countless 
times when I have been hanging 
out with my guy friends and 
we decide to play basketball. 
Without fail, I am picked last. 
I know it might sound petty – 
complaining about being picked 
last – but that’s not the point. The 
point is that of the group in which 
I end up playing these pick-up 
games, I am the only person 
who actually played basketball. 
I played for my entire life on 
competitive club teams and high 

school varsity. None of them 
played past fifth grade. But I am 
a girl, so I’m picked last – always. 
That’s the issue that is ignored. 
Because that’s just how the world 
works. My friends aren’t really 
sexist, they don’t truly believe that 
I am lesser than them. Simply, they 
have been conditioned to feel this 
is acceptable.
Young boys are raised in a world 
that believes men are stronger, 
faster and more athletic than 
women, and whether they mean 
to or not, they end up perpetuating 
these ideas through their own 
actions. We need to start to 
recognize the kind of embedded 
sexism that is constantly faced by 
female athletes. People need to see 
that saying “that’s just how it is” 
is not an answer and is a cop out 
for not addressing a real issue that 
needs to be fixed.
Passive 
acceptance 
of 
inequalities 
is 
no 
longer 
acceptable. 
It 
is 
time 
male 
athletes step up and speak up 
about the issues female athletes 
are facing. And just to leave you 
with a statistic that highlights 
this 
inequity, 
Forbes 
just 
released their list of the Top 100 
Highest Paid Athletes and not a 
single one was a woman. Not one. 
This can no longer be “just the 
way the world works.” We need 
change, we need progress and we 
need it now.

The science behind implicit bias
T

he 
April 
arrest 
of 
two 
black 
men 
at 
a 
Philadelphia 
Starbucks 
has reignited public discourse on 
the topic of racial discrimination. 
Arguments proposed by the most 
vocal critics of the incident, who 
have charged the coffee chain 
with racism, portray it as the 
latest scene of a systemic white 
supremacy that has terrorized 
minorities for decades. In a post-
Jim Crow America, the question 
must be asked: How could such 
a widespread manifestation of 
racism persist in our society? 
The consensus has been, as 
far as Starbucks’ perception is 
concerned, 
that 
unconscious 
profiling is the culprit.
The idea that motivations 
can exist beneath the level of 
conscious knowledge is hardly 
a new idea; this was precisely 
the scandalous observation that 
set a prude Viennese aristocracy 
on fire in the days of Sigmund 
Freud. Marked as it is by racial 
tension, our current era takes 
as the object of scandal not 
implicit sexual attitudes but 
racial ones. As it applies to the 
Starbucks arrests, the argument 
states that even if the barista 
harbored no explicit prejudice 
against African-Americans, she 
was nonetheless motivated by 
an unconscious bias to call the 
police when the men declined to 
order anything. The assumption 
here is that race played a 
decisive role in the events that 
unfolded, that the arrest would 
not have been made if the men 
were white.
The 
Implicit 
Association 
Test has emerged as the most 
prominent assessment for the 
kind of implicit bias that has 
been implicated in the Starbucks 
incident. For those unfamiliar 
with the test, I encourage you to 
try it — it doesn’t take more than 
20 minutes, and the firsthand 
experience will be a far better 
explanation than what follows. 
In the relevant version of the 
test, there are two parts. one 
is when there are two buttons: 
“white and good adjectives” and 
“Black and bad adjectives,” and 
the other is when the two buttons 
are “Black and good adjectives” 
and “white and bad adjectives.”. 
The finding of this simple test is 
similar to others in psychometry 
— the practice of timing mental 
processes — in that the speed 
of our categorization changes 
significantly based on another 

parameter. In this case, that 
other parameter is the face 
we see prior to the word: It 
consistently takes people longer 
to identify positive words, and 
shorter 
to 
identify 
negative 
words, when Black and good 
are the same button, because of 
implicit bias.
Perusing other versions of the 
assessment, it was startling to 
consider just how many identity 
groups may be affected by the 
phenomenon 
of 
unconscious 
bias. Age, weight, and physical 
disability among athletes were 
some 
of 
the 
most 
striking 
examples outside the typical race 
or sex considerations, all three 
of which have been associated 
with the classic IAT finding 
of delayed response time. The 
diversity of subgroups present 
in the assessment is a testament 
not 
only 
to 
the 
potential 
ubiquity of implicit bias, but 
to 
the 
rising 
sociocultural 
movement 
that 
is 
bringing 
this issue to the forefront. 
The floodgates holding back 
the 
uncomfortable 
topic 
of 
unconscious 
marginalization 
have been opened.
As far as strictly scientific 
evidence is concerned, the IAT 
is still as close as we can get to 
quantifying the phenomenon of 
implicit bias. But even this has 
been scrutinized by scientists 
wary of the test, a skepticism 
that has slowly but surely been 
extending into the field of 
social psychology at large. Some 
psychologists 
maintain 
that 
the results of this assessment 
suffer from low replicability, 
and that the test itself fails 
to live up to quality-control 
standards. Moreover, the IAT 
seems completely inept at doing 
what it’s designed to do: actually 
predict potential acts of bias. 
Despite these criticisms — if 
only for the sake of argument — 
I’ll assume that these results are 
valid and consistent. Where do 
we go from there?
It’s 
my 
belief 
that 
the 
psychometric approach outlined 
by the IAT is not a rigorous 
method of demonstrating that 
unconscious racism exists per 
se. This position was largely 
influenced by my own experience 
taking the test. Within a few

EMMA CHANG | SUMMER EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR

T

he 
California 
primaries 
were a few weeks ago and 
the 
Michigan 
primaries 
on Aug. 7 are fast approaching. 
This November marks the national 
midterm elections that have the 
potential to change America’s 
political 
landscape, 
and 
this 
country 
needs 
some 
serious 
changing. But how exactly did we 
get to this point in the first place? 
A lot of people point to President 
Donald 
at 
Trump 
and 
the 
Republican Party, which is very 
true, but I’m also looking at the vast 
number of people who did not vote 
and, though they did not directly 
support Trump, were essential to 
his presidential victory.
In the past week, I have 
scrolled 
through 
Twitter 
and 
read tweets about how similar 
America’s 
relationship 
with 
Mexican immigrants is to the way 
the Nazis treated their Jewish 
population. And they are not 
wrong. One tweet, in particular, 
pointed out how taking rosary 
beads from Mexican women is like 
taking wedding rings from Jewish 
women. Another tweet highlighted 
the differences between platforms; 
on the one hand, people on Twitter 
are outraged, while on Instagram, 
people have just recently started 
to acknowledge the state of our 
nation. This struck a chord. Here I 
was, peacefully watching “Gilmore 
Girls,” and at this moment, people 
in this country are being torn away 
from their families— and I feel like 
I haven’t done anything. The only 
immediate course of action I could 
think of was to like the tweet and 
feel sad about where we are as a 
country. But that’s not enough.
In a generation where political 
activism 
and 
awareness 
is 
a 
defining 
characteristic 
of 
a 
person, the question remains: Do 
we actually know or even care 
about what is happening? How 
many of us actually keep up with 
the minute details of our state 
legislature? Sure, I could tell you 
the midterm elections are this 
year and yes, I understand that 
they are important in combating 
our current administration. But 
could I tell you anything about 
the candidates? Most likely, no. 
As a person who likes to think 
of herself as “politically aware,” 
this revelation was incredibly 
disconcerting, especially as the 
Michigan primaries and midterms 
approach.
Social media has fostered a 

false grasp of politics within our 
country’s youth. It’s much too 
easy to retweet or post a picture 
of your political opinions and feel 
as though you are participating in 
the democratic process. This exact 
thing happened with net neutrality. 
It is still a huge issue, yet is no 
longer trending on Twitter and, 
therefore, no longer relevant to our 
generation. But the opposite is true. 
Other outlets such as podcasts like 
“Pod Save America” and Crooked 
Media’s other content are great 
for feeling informed and trying 
to understand the conversation, 
but a lot of this so-called “action” 
stops there. The company does a 
fantastic job highlighting those 
on the ground, trying to get things 
done as well as creating their own 
campaign 
against 
the 
current 
administration, but how many 
of their listeners actually follow 
through on the passionate requests 
and commands of Jon Lovett and 
Jon Favreau?
This false sense of awareness is 
dangerous. With only a surface-
level understanding of both the 
candidates and issues at hand, a lot 
of the great aspects of democracy 
are lost on a complacent public. One 
of the best features of this country 
is our right to vote, yet much of the 
younger generation did not vote in 
the presidential election, an issue 
with repercussions that none of us 
thought possible. 
As a result of the last election, I 
know a lot of my friends and other 
young people around the country 
have worked diligently to help 
educate both ourselves and our 
peers. Yara Shahidi, an 18-year-
old actress from the hit shows 
“Black-ish” 
and 
“Grown-ish,” 
started an important campaign 
called “Eighteenx18,” a program 
that works to educate and register 
younger voters. Just how much 
impact has the program had, 
however? The actress has 2.4 
million followers on Instagram, but 
only 16,600 follow the program’s 
account. That’s less than 1 percent 
of her audience. Sixteen thousand 
is still a lot, but is it enough?
Some would argue it is. Others 
would argue that they have a 
much 
deeper 
understanding 
both of their role as a voter and 
who they are voting for, and they 
might be right. But there are still 
people out there that might not 
have the opportunity, privilege or 
motivation to spend hours combing 
through 
state 
and 
national 

politics—yet still for some reason, 
feel as though they are deserving 
of the label “politically active.” 
I’m going to say it right now: I am 
one of these people. It isn’t that I 
don’t care, it is just that there are 
so many other things going on in 
my life that often take precedence 
over the fact that I really need to 
figure out for whom I want to vote; 
however, up until the California 
primaries and the writing of this 
article, I would have proudly 
stated I am very heavily involved 
in politics when, in reality, I’m not.
While I do sometimes think 
about how I should be helping 
out a campaign, I have realized 
I just do not have the time—or, 
rather, I do not want to make it 
one of my priorities. There are 
people out there who will make it 
a priority and will push campaigns 
forward, but there are still more 
people out there who have a basic 
understanding of politics, but no 
real wish to participate beyond 
voting. 
Therein 
lies 
another 
problem: voter participation. One 
of the biggest parts of a successful 
democracy is the voters. In 2016, 
only about 34 percent of Michigan 
residents came out to vote in the 
primaries, and 63 percent voted 
in the general election. Compared 
nationally, Michigan does pretty 
well; 28.5 percent of the nation 
came out for the primaries and 58 
percent for the general election. 
Still, though, participation in the 
country’s elections is an essential 
part of our democracy and even 
if you don’t feel like knocking on 
doors to help educate your peers, 
at least educate yourself and go 
vote. 
I applaud those who can join 
the political campaigns and are 
actively 
participating 
in 
the 
democratic 
process. 
However, 
the fact is, the majority of our 
generation is only trying to get 
involved. But just “trying” isn’t 
enough. It’s not enough to post 
your opinions on Twitter or 
Instagram. It’s not enough to 
simply go to a women’s march 
and post a picture captioned with 
support for the movement. None 
of the marches and protests are 
enough without an educated voter 
and their subsequent decision at 
the polling place.

rounds of the assessment, 
I 
found 
myself 
using 
a 
simple verbal strategy to 
my 
advantage: 
Whenever 
the Black face and negative 
word prompted the same 
key, I identified both with 
the verbal association Black/
bad, an alliteration which I 
felt made my responses faster 
and more accurate. If the 
similar phonology of these 
words contributed to the 
increased response rate, this 
seems to cast doubt on the 
idea that negative emotional 
responses 
are 
necessarily 
at play in the IAT. Now, it’s 
certainly the case that not 
everyone 
was 
using 
this 
makeshift strategy, so I can’t 
argue empirically that this 
explains the results. But I 
think this demonstrates on 
theoretical grounds that a 
delay in response time is 
not necessarily caused by 
negative 
emotional 
biases 
against a particular race.
Still, influential studies 
have shown that preferences 
for names can result in a 
detectable and unconscious 
bias 
against 
minority 
groups. 
So 
the 
question 
is, if not the IAT, how 
else might we go about 
quantifying the phenomenon 
of implicit bias? In order to 
arrive at a more rigorous 
demonstration, I think the 
neurobiological 
findings 
by University of Southern 
California 
neuroscientist 
Antonio 
Damasio 
should 
be 
considered. 
According 
to 
his 
somatic 
marker 
hypothesis, 
our 
rational 
deliberation of options is not 
a purely indifferent process, 
devoid 
of 
any 
emotional 
content. 
Instead, 
certain 
outcomes are “marked” by 
physiological 
responses 
according 
to 
our 
own 

mindset and experiences.
Under this framework, a 
demonstration 
of 
implicit 
bias becomes clear. Imagine 
a 
manager 
who, 
in 
two 
separate 
cases, 
considers 
whether to call police on 
someone who has entered 
their establishment without 
ordering anything. If the 
physiological responses of 
such a decision, or something 
like it, could be measured 
(say, by using galvanic skin 
detectors, 
which 
measure 
our 
stress 
response), 
we 
might 
have 
objective 
evidence 
that 
negative 
emotions 
underlie 
our 
seemingly bias-free decisions 
when 
race 
is 
involved. 
Unlike 
the 
psychometric 
IAT test, which relies on 
the circumstantial fact of 
delayed response, I think 
such a physiological result 
could provide a definitive 
measure of implicit bias.
That said, I encourage 
everyone to take the IAT 
for themselves and grapple 
with the question of what 
scientific result constitutes 
direct evidence of negative 
racial bias. To reiterate, I feel 
that we haven’t yet arrived 
at an objective standard to 
definitively say that a certain 
individual is “unconsciously 
racist.” 
A 
scientific, 
and 
strictly 
neurobiological, 
approach 
might 
someday 
take us there. The history 
of America has been fraught 
with 
racial 
strife 
and 
injustice for a majority of its 
history; let’s all contribute 
to progress by tackling these 
difficult questions with an 
open and deliberative mind.

“That’s tight. It’s A$AP Rocky, 
yeah?”
Pressed up against us, shoulder 
to shoulder, for the entirety 
of two performances, Danny’s 
thin white shirt was almost 
translucent with sweat by the 
time he finally decided to speak. 
It was, indeed, A$AP Rocky 
that had been blaring through 
our iPhone speakers, as the sun 
began to set over the woodlands 
of Dover, Delaware, and we 
desperately tried to stave off 
the ache of our blistered feet. 
Instantly charmed by Danny’s 
British accent, we threw Testing 
to the wayside in order to focus 
on the “Skins” archetype that had 
manifested beside us. 
“I told myself that I would be 
at the very next Arctic Monkeys 
show. No matter where or when 
it was, I would be there. So when 
it was announced that they 
would be headlining Firefly…,” 
Danny smiled slightly and turned 
toward the empty stage, as if he 
could already see the phantom 
image of Alex Turner crooning 
into the mic. 
Firefly Music Festival, like 
most 
other 
music 
festivals, 
has the particular quality of 
attracting people from various 
pockets of the world and forcing 
them to coexist semi-peacefully 
in one enclosed area. Unlike 
most 
other 
music 
festivals, 
however, Firefly stretches over 
the course of almost five days, 
which, surrounded by miles of 
empty cornfields and barricaded 
by rows upon rows of nylon tents, 
can seem to bleed into infinity. 
Time unravels to become as 
distant as the outside world itself. 
In this bubble of perfectly 

contained chaos, there is more 
than just music. A community 
begins to form amid the dust and 
the turmoil. A strange, off-kilter 
community 
— 
where 
bottles 
of Gatorade 95% filled with 
Everclear are treated with the 
same amount of reverence as holy 
water and the neighbors won’t 
stop playing the same shitty 
EDM remix at 4 a.m. — but a 
community, nonetheless.

Foster the People
“Pumped Up Kicks” was the 
“Ring Around the Rosie” of early 
High School. Hear me out: just how 
there was always one preschooler 
loudly announcing “Ring Around 
the Rosie”’s connection to the 
Bubonic 
Plague, 
there 
was 
always one adolescent upstart 
loudly announcing “Pumped Up 
Kicks”’s connection to a school 
shooting. I know this because 
I was that adolescent upstart, 
desperately clutching at any way 
I could put both middle fingers 
up at authority without actually 
having to put any middle fingers 
up. Foster the People arrived at 
an integral moment; their music 
a perfect blend of indie rock with 
a little bit of edge, hard enough 
to feel appropriately rebellious 
when blasted out of rolled down 
windows on the drive to school 
but still pop enough to fit with 
the quiet lanes of suburbia. 
Their Firefly set was much of 
the same balance, interpersing 
mellow 
crowd 
favorites 
like 
“Houdini” 
and 
“Don’t 
Stop 
(Color On the Walls)” with more 
experimental 
performances 
based 
off 
of 
the 
moody 

psychedelia 
of 
their 
newest 
album Sacred Hearts Club, a 
phrase which was emblazoned 
in larger-than-life neon script on 
the back wall of the Firefly stage. 
As lead singer Mark Foster stood 
in front of the words, ripped 
sleeves 
and 
scrappy 
tattoos 
backlit by reds, blues and yellows, 
before launching into a cover of 
the Ramones’s “Blitzkrieg Pop,” 
I felt a familiar sense of preteen 
angst rise up from the pit of my 
stomach. 
Someone next to us said that 
the set gave them “major Tame 
Impala vibes.” While the synth-
heavy, spiraling light show of 
songs “Pseudologia Fantastica” 
and “Loyal Like Sid & Nancy” 
were reminiscent of tracks out of 
Lonerism, the Foster the People 
that caused me to rip my jeans 
at the knee and black out my 
white converse with permanent 
markers in the 10th grade was 
still alive and well. They closed 
their set with the familiar beat of 
“Pumped Up Kicks.”

Arctic Monkeys
The first line of Apple Music’s 
description 
of 
the 
Arctic 
Monkeys’s newest album after 
five years, Tranquility Base Hotel 
& Casino, reads “In 2016, Alex 
Turner received a piano for his 
30th birthday.” It’s about the 
only description you need to 

understand the album’s brooding, 
introspective corridors. And as 
you wander throughout quiet 
jazz undertones and lounge-
pop bursts, it’s easy to imagine a 
mustachioed Alex Turner in the 
casino basement, plunking away 
at a grand piano with a glass of 
scotch in one hand, ready to tell 
you about his past exploits as a 
smooth-talking, aviator-wearing 
rock star. The album is muted, 
bittersweet and filled with a 
melancholic sort of appeal. Yet, 
these are songs for late hours 
spent alone — solitude mixing 
with the slow crawl of a dying 
cigarette — not for the sweaty, 
beer-drenched animal farm of 
Firefly. The crowd that had been 
waiting hours in order to see the 
Arctic Monkeys did not come 
to watch Alex Turner cry over a 
piano. We came for the Whatever 
People Say I Am, That’s What 
I’m Not, for the Favourite Worst 
Nightmare, for the Who The Fuck 
Are The Arctic Monkeys? 
Thank God Alex Turner seemed 
to understand that, bursting out 
on stage with a rousing rendition 
of “Brianstorm,” and instantly 
turning the first 20 rows of 
the crowd into a pit of flailing 
fists. Dressed to impress in a 
monochromatic suit, hair slicked 
back, every inch of him was the 
same man who used to break the 
hearts of Tumblr fanatics left and 
right. And damn, did he put on a 
great show. 
Playing only a few songs from 
Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino, 
which became welcome breaks 
from the moshing, most of the 
set was a trip down memory lane. 
There was something for every 
Arctic Monkeys fan here, from 
more popular songs like “Why’d 
You Only Call Me When You’re 
High” and “505” to tracks pulled 
from the shadows of old EPs, 
like “Don’t Sit Down ‘Cause I’ve 
Moved Your Chair” and “Pretty 
Visitors.” No matter how far back 
the Arctic Monkeys reached, Alex 
Turner was on top of every note, 
every minute. Over-exaggerating 
his gestures and postures to play 
along with the lyrics of the songs, 
he brought them, as well as all the 
memories of crowdgoers to life. 
The set closed out with “R U 
Mine?” and as “All I wanna hear 
her say is are you mine,” echoed 
around me, bumping along the 
hoarse edges of a throng of 
gleeful voices, I looked over to 
where Danny, my boy from across 
the pond, was being thrown from 
side to side. We locked eyes, and 
I could tell he was feeling what 
I was feeling in that moment: 

perfect, harmonious catharsis.

Lil Wayne
There was so much Lil Wayne 
slander at this festival that I 
almost 
developed 
a 
twitch. 
Pusha-T warned us on DAYTONA: 
“He see what I see when you see 
Wayne on tour / Flash without 
the fire / Another multi-platinum 
rapper trapped and can’t retire.” 
I disregarded these bars before 
the show because Lil Wayne 
is without question a legend, a 
rapper so important to the game 
that any conversation about rap 
in the 2000s isn’t only incomplete 
without mentioning him, but 
nonexistent. 
It 
was 
simply 
incredible to think that he had 
somehow lost the fire. 
Yet 
Firefly 
festival 
goers 
seemed completely unaware of 
the greatness they stood below; 
called his set “disappointing” 
when he performed “A Milli” in 
pink getup, could hardly shout the 
chorus of “Mrs. Officer.” Concerts 
are symbiotic, requiring energy 
from both the performer and the 
spectators, and while Wayne still 
had the flash (how could someone 
who wrote “Georgia Bush” come 
without it?) there was a creeping 
sense that the fire was slowly 
extinguished by this disrespect. 
I felt a sadness as people merely 
laughed at his height and said his 
voice sounded “strange” during 
“Lollipop.” At the age of 21, I 
already felt old, upset at these 
teenagers who didn’t understand 
the importance of what they were 
seeing, couldn’t possibly know 
the absolute joy of screaming “she 
licked me like a lollipop” at age 
12 in the minivan, right before 
mom and dad switched the radio 
channel. It seemed like Wayne 
could sense the loss too.
— Matt Gallatin

The Killers
They brought up a kid named 
“Brian” from the crowd to play 
drums. The frontman looked 
like a glam rocker from the ‘80s. 
Never before have I seen so many 
people turn into suburban dads 
right before my eyes. I guess they 
played “Mr. Brightside”? 
— Matt Gallatin

His name was actually “Ryan.” 
He was from West Chester, 
Pennsylvania and he was doing 
his best.

Pray For The 
Wicked

Panic! at the Disco

Fueled By Ramen

I would like to preface this review 
by stating I am the person at Daily 
Arts least expected to write it. I am by 
no means a Panic! fan; it wasn’t until 
recently that I finally put together 
that the “closing the goddamn door” 
song was their “I Write Sins Not 
Tragedies.” For the longest while, 
the band was nothing more than 
word association for me: If someone 
said “Panic! At The Disco,” I thought 
Brendon Urie. Besides his name and 
his Broadway stint performing in 
“Kinky Boots,” I knew nothing about 
the man. I always assumed there was 
at least two or three other bandmates 
to round out Panic, but it looks like 
now that’s not even true.
I would say I took on this review 
to write out of my musical comfort 
zone, write about something that 
doesn’t have its roots in hip hop or 
R&B, but I won’t beat around the 
bush with this review’s little secret: I 
decided to sign up for it because my 
wonderful girlfriend is a huge Panic! 
At The Disco fan. So, without further 
ado, I present the thoughts of a Panic! 
neophyte (happily blinded by love) 
on their latest release, Pray For The 
Wicked.
From an initial listen of the album, 
it’s clear Mr. Urie was inspired by his 
time under the spotlight and his love 
for musicals in general. The sound of 
Pray For The Wicked is grounded in 
peppy horns, backed by unobtrusive 
basslines and drum patterns, the sort 
of triumphant live instrumentation 
commonly 
heard 
in 
Broadway 
recordings. At times, it seems like 
the album could be easily adapted to 
a stage production. The question is, 
would the overarching story of that 
musical be any good?
It seems like the only thing Urie has 

to say on Pray For The Wicked is that 
he’s made it; he’s overcome adversity 
and avoided pitfalls that stop most 
starving artists dead in their tracks. 
While some tracks contain slight 
musings on his religious roots, past 
relationships and the wasteful nature 
of drugs and alcohol, most refer back 
to Urie’s rise to stardom.
Brendon Urie has basically become 
a one-man show, so it’s no denying 
that the lyrical content was written 
by him and was majorly influenced 
by his life up to this point. That’s not 
to say Urie comes off as self-centered 
with a Father John Misty-sized ego, 
though. Pray For The Wicked seeks 
to be inspirational, with most of the 
songs functioning as celebrations of 
following your dreams and finding 
success, and reminding the listener 

to never be complacent and always 
aim higher. This is immediately 
made clear, as Urie shouts “Fuck a 
silver lining / ‘cause only gold is hot 
enough” just 12 seconds into the 
opening track.
Urie incorporates his life story into 
this symphony of encouragement: He 
was “shooting for the stars when [he] 
couldn’t make a killing” on the chorus 
of the insanely upbeat “High Hopes,” 
the mania of his “Roaring 20s” 
eventually resulted in him finding 
an accepting new home on Broadway 
and he even named on one of the 
songs “Hey Look Ma, I Made It.” The 
one song not grounded in some form 
of positivity is album closer “Dying 
In LA,” which explores a different 
side of following your dreams, the 
one that only results in lost hope and 

breaking under pressure. In ending 
the album with this hackneyed a 
maxim — fame is not all it’s cracked 
up to be — one realizes that Urie 
does not have much original to say 
throughout the whole of the album. 
It’s the same motivating shindig 
that’s been thrown thousands of 
times before.
Yet music doesn’t have to be 
complex 
and 
embellished 
with 
original meaning to be good. Pray 
For The Wicked lacks real cohesion 
and comes off as more a collection 
of songs than an album, but it isn’t 
supposed to be some profound 
narrative that lands it a top spot on 
multiple end-of-the-year lists. Panic’s 
music has always been designed to 
be sung along — individual verses 
are often whispery, slower and not 
terribly indicative of Urie’s incredible 
vocal talent, while the high notes and 
riffing are reserved for the choruses. 
It’s almost like Urie knows his fans 
are going to want to belt out the 
catchy chorus and match his cadence, 
so he rewards those who know all the 
words a chance to rest their voices 
with the intermediary verses.
While Pray For The Wicked 
doesn’t entice me to test my singing 
capabilities, that’s OK: I am not the 
target audience. The album sustains 
the same playful intensity most major 
musicals reserve for their vigorous 
bookending 
numbers, 
with 
the 
occasional sprinkle of an emotional 
ballad here and there. Brendon Urie 
knows his music doesn’t have to be 
nuanced high art, so instead with his 
latest effort as Panic! At The Disco, 
he focuses on refining his fun, catchy 
pop rock sound. Although it doesn’t 
particularly toot my horn, hearing 
it play in the car with my girlfriend 
singing along from the passenger seat 
certainly does bring a smile to my 
face.

‘Pray For The Wicked’ is 
fun, easy listening for all

“Let’s turn off the blue lights,” 
Iceage frontman Elias Bender 
Rønnenfelt 
muttered 
at 
the 
beginning of their show last Friday. 
Suddenly, the patient audience at 
El Club was plunged into darkness. 
Illuminated by the red glow of 
the stage, Rønnenfelt and his 
bandmates were magnetic, a sickly-
sexy collection of thin, stylish 
Danes 
with 
serious 
presence. 
Packed into the small Mexicantown 
venue, the crowd was hanging on to 
their every move in a shifting mass 
of noise and color. There are those 
who say punk is dead, but really 
it’s just different — now a spirit of 
pure emotion, anger and joy fused 
together into sound. That’s what 
Iceage does best.
Formed in 2008 in Copenhagen, 
the band’s first three albums were 
a mix of punk rigor and rambling, 
artistic soundscapes. Rønnenfelt’s 
signature drawl moves through 
each and every song on seemingly 
only instinct. Their 2011 debut 
garnered critical acclaim from 
industry legends like Lester Bangs 
himself, setting them onto a path of 
success and earning them a devoted 
following. In early May, Iceage 
released a fourth studio record 
titled Beyondless, and the growth 
was clear. A perfect mesh of discord 
and atmosphere, the album is a 
high point for the group, and this 
was all but obvious at their show 
supporting it.
After an opening act comprised 
of Detroit noise collective Wolf Eyes 
and the soothing, looped beauty of 
harpist Mary Lattimore, Iceage 
brought down the house one song 
after another. It was as if each tune 
from Beyondless had been reduced 
down to an essence, the expansive 
scale of their studio production 
boiled down into a series of 
thumping beats, thick basslines and 
eerie, yet moving guitar riffs. That 
isn’t to say their live performance 
isn’t just as striking. If anything, it is 

a perfect translation of the intensity 
their recordings evoke. 
Rønnenfelt was born to be 
a frontman. Dressed in a beige 
twill suit and thin linen shirt, his 
eyes light behind a veil of sweat-
laced hair. The singer staggered 
around the stage for the duration 
of their show, his trademark vocals 
somewhat drowned out by a wall 
of instrumental sound, but it didn’t 
matter — his stage presence, along 
with bandmates Jakob Tvilling 
Pless, Johan Surrballe Wieth and 
Dan Kjær Nielsen was incredible. 
On album favorites like “Hurrah” 
and “Painkiller,” audience members 
yelled the lyrics just as he uttered 
them, creating a dissonant choir set 
against the music.
Those nearest to the stage 
reached up to clutch at the vocalist’s 
clothes as he came closer to the 
edge, in reverence to his uncanny 
hypnotic quality and the dazed 
melodies accompanying him. In 
another world, the 26-year old 
could easily be a cult leader — his 
performance has a sense of intense 
gravitas that is strangely accessible. 
After you realize he’s real, you want 
to sit and have a drink with him. 
Before the show, the band roved 
around El Club’s small bar and exited 
to the patio to smoke, accompanied 
by Rønnenfelt’s girlfriend, and 
powerhouse musician in her own 
right, Sky Ferreira. Despite their 
power onstage, for the venue’s 
patrons Iceage was just four guys in 
a band, mixing with their audience 
in a communal appreciation of their 
music.
It’s this balance between comfort 
and edge that makes Iceage’s music 
and performances so memorable. 
The band’s greatest strength lies 
in their ability to produce a sort of 
dynamic tug between the melodic 
and harsh elements of the post-
punk sound to create detailed 
soundscapes which ebb and flow. 
On Beyondless, they have refined 
this skill to a point. On stage, they 
are electric, meshing passion and 
movement into ecstatic cacophony.

Report details 
developments in 
synthetic biology 

By SAYALI AMIN

Daily Staff Reporter

Michael Imperiale, an esteemed 
microbiology 
and 
immunology 
professor at the University of 
Michigan, 
recently 
chaired 
a 
national committee to help write a 
report that aimed to prioritize and 
identify potential threats in the 
advancing field of synthetic biology. 
The report, titled “Biodefense in 
the Age of Synthetic Biology,” was 
sponsored by the U.S. Department 
of Defense and published by the 
National Academies of Science, 
Engineering, and Medicine.”
According 
to 
Imperiale, 
synthetic biology alters biological 
organisms through various types of 
computational and design methods.
“Synthetic biology refers to a set 
of concepts, approaches and tools 
that facilitate the modification or 
creation of biological organisms,” 
Imperiale said. “These approaches 
are, for the most part, founded in 
engineering principles.”
While synthetic biology has 
many positive contributions to 
society such as biofuels and new 
drug development, Imperiale said it 
also has the capability to do harm.
“The Department of Defense 
asked the National Academies to 
take this study because they really 
wanted to get some advice about 
what the potential vulnerabilities 
with respect to biodefense would be 
due to this emerging technology,” 
Imperiale said.
Patrick 
Boyle, 
an 
organism 
designer at Ginkgo BioWorks Inc. 
who also helped author the report, 
has direct experience with the 
synthetic biology industry.
“When I was a graduate student 
in synthetic biology less than 10 
years ago, I synthesized about 10 
genes over the course of my entire 
thesis work,” Boyle wrote in an 
email interview. “At Ginkgo, my 
team designs tens of thousands of 
genes every month for synthesis. 
This work gives me a perspective 
on how ‘bad actors’ might use 
synthetic biology if they have a 
lot of resources and large teams at 

their disposal.”
Imperiale explained the process 
of writing this report could be 
broken down into two parts.
“The first thing we did was to 
come up with a framework for how 
to look at these capabilities that are 
enabled by synthetic biology and 
then determine how much concern 
should we have about any of these 
capabilities,” Imperiale said. “In 
the second part what we did was 
apply the framework to a series of 
capabilities that we thought were 
the most obvious to think about.”
The report ranks 12 capabilities 
of synthetic biology in terms of 
their potential threat to society 
based on the framework created. 
Altering bacteria ranks near the top 
of the list, according to Imperiale.
“One of the ones we thought was 
of most concern was modifying 
bacteria to make them more 
dangerous,” Imperiale said. “For 
example, someone could take a 
bacterium that causes disease and 
engineer it so that it’s now resistant 
to antibiotic treatment; it’s now 
much harder to treat.”
The framework is intended to 
apply to any new developments in 
synthetic biology that may arise in 
the future as well.
“Biotechnology 
is 
changing 
rapidly, so our ranking of threats 
in the report itself is just a snapshot 
of 
current 
capabilities,” 
Boyle 
wrote. “I expect the framework 
itself to be more enduring as it 
anticipates that the barriers and 
bottlenecks limiting the nefarious 
uses of synthetic biology will be 
challenged by new discoveries.”
In an email interview, Nina Lin, 
chemical 
engineering 
associate 
professor at the University, wrote 
her lab uses synthetic biology to 
address issues of renewable and 
sustainable fuel as well as chemical 
production.
“It’s very important to point out 
that the synthetic biology research 
community is very aware and 
proactive to the dual use of this 
highly promising and powerful 
technology,” Lin wrote. “Almost 
at every major synthetic biology 
conference, there are sessions 
dedicated to the safety issues where 
researchers and other experts come 
together to discuss and formulate 
preventive plans.”

A nostalgic piece from a disaporic Syrian

 Mental illness is something 
hardly talked about in our 
country. 
Though 
mental 
illnesses 
like 
depression, 
anxiety, and bipolar disorder 
are extremely common, and 
are extremely pressing issues, 
for some reason, discussion 
of them always seems to get 
swept under the rug. Mental 
illness plays a role in as high as 
90 percent of suicides amongst 
some professionals, though 
this statistic is often times 
debated, there is no denying 
that mental health directly 
correlates to mortality rates. 
These studies are extremely 
concerning, considering the 
increasing suicide rates in our 
nation. Mental health should 
be something we are always 
talking about — we shouldn’t 
have to wait until the latest 
suicide, whether it be someone 
you know or a celebrity.
 As little as mental health is 
talked about in America, it’s 
discussed even less among 
people of color. Having a 
mental illness is stigmatized 
in 
communities 
of 
color, 
something that makes you 
weak, something you should be 
ashamed of and should not talk 
about. Even though the reality 
of the world is that a lot of 
times, people of color are more 
likely to have mental health 
issues, probably because the 
discrimination and oppression 
they face on a daily basis 
have adverse effects on their 

mentality. For example, African 
American adults are 20 percent 
more likely to experience 
mental health issues than the 
rest of the population.
 One reason why mental 
illnesses are so prevalent in 
communities of color is that self-
care, something that can really 
help to prevent mental issues, 
is seen as a luxury and not a 
necessity. In one of my classes 
during the school year that was 
made up solely of students of 
color, we discussed the stigmas 
associated 
with 
self-care 
options such as therapy or yoga. 
Many students recounted how 
in their communities, things 
like those were described as 
“things for white people,” or 
luxuries versus necessities to 
help your mental health. We 
also discussed how in all of 
our respective communities, 
things like therapy were seen 
as taboo and something not to 
be discussed and to be swept 
under the rug, that it was 
embarrassing to have an issue 
requiring professional help and 
if you did you just should not 
talk about it.
 The lack of discussion about 
mental health leads to multiple 
issues, as it seriously invalidates 
the experiences of those who do 
have mental health problems. 
This is because it makes them 
feel as if there’s something 
seriously wrong with them 
or that they’re inferior to the 
rest of their community. In 
reality, multiple people in their 
community 
are 
struggling 
with the same issues but are 

uncomfortable with bringing it 
up because of the stigma. This 
adds to the stigma because no 
one talks about it, creating a 
cycle.
 I know one of the 
subconscious reasons I have felt 
othered as a Nigerian woman 
and a Black woman is due to 
the fact that I have depression 
and anxiety. Having a mental 
illness is never discussed in the 
circles and communities I’m 
in, both of Black people, and 
of Nigerian people. People just 
always talked about how when 
you face struggles and have 
problems, you were supposed 
to toughen up and work 
through it, making it seem so 
simple. Like all of my problems 
could be solved with easy fixes 
and if I was having issues, 
I must be doing something 
wrong.
 I know from talking to my 
parents and cousins that 
mental illnesses “aren’t really 
a thing” in Nigeria. There, 
nobody talks about them and 
they’re never diagnosed. I can 
only imagine what it would 
be like to live with a mental 
illness there. Someone who 
has depression would just be 
considered prone to periods 
of sad moods and someone 
who has anxiety would just be 
considered a big worrier. Your 
illness would stop being just 
an illness and would begin to 
define who you are.
 

On Dec. 18, 2010, the Arab 
world was reborn. A series of 
peaceful uprisings flourished 
all around the area, starting 
in 
Tunisia 
and 
rippling 
across the region, spreading, 
extending, expanding, creating 
a movement of angry people 
with thundering voices, calling 
on their governments to step 
down.
 I have lived my entire 
life 5,959 miles away from 
the country that harbors my 
lineage. My memory of the 
birthplace of my parents and 
my parents’ parents is a mere 
postcard in the back of my 
mind. I am a Syrian American 
who has not touched Syrian 
land in so long that even my 
most 
prominent 
memories 
are starting to fade. The scars 
from the scabs I pulled from 
the elbows which I scraped on 
my grandma’s sidewalk have 
faded. The ink on the back of 
dated pictures my mom took 
of my brothers and me in our 
early youth has faded. My 
conceptual understanding of 
a land far away from where I 
stand is fading. Like forgetting 
the lyrics to your favorite song 
you swore you would never 
forget, I am forgetting what 
Syria is like.
 Having been removed from 
Syria for eight years, it is easy 
to romanticize the clouds of 
smoke from the hookah pipes, 
circling with the resonating 
echo of laughter, sweetened 
tea on the mosaic table on the 
veranda, looking out across 
the beautiful city lights of 
Damascus. It is easy for me to 
romanticize the marks of my 
ancestors’ great civilizations 
before me, the lullabies of the 
slowly churning water wheels 
that brand the city of Hama. It 
is easy for me to romanticize 
the 
sweet 
pheromone 
of 
jasmine flowers, like being 
surrounded by a cloud of floral 
perfume, blending effortlessly 
with the scent of car exhaust 
and carbon monoxide, creating 
a smooth and completely 
satisfying aroma that floods 
the mind with childhood 
memories; a unique scent that 
takes me back to a time when 

I was young. A time when I 
chased butterflies with my 
cousins and traced ants back 
to their anthills. A time when I 
would come home with dirt in 
my hair, on my face and in my 
pockets. A time where I piled 
into taxis made for five with 
eight other people. My Syria 
consists of Kodak moments. 
Moments of birthdays, first 
steps, 
first 
words, 
family 
reunions, good food and late 
night “SpaceToons” TV. My 
Syria is a happy Syria, a Syria of 
innocence, a Syria of sleeping in 
my grandfather’s lap, a Syria of 
comfort.
 I remember the nights 
being hot and the days being 
hotter. I remember the water 
coming and going, I remember 
not being able to drink from 
the tap and I remember 
having working electricity for 
only select hours at a time. I 
remember these things and 
I remember them only ever 
being temporary for me. These 
disturbances 
were 
minor 
setbacks, they were funny 
in the first weeks of every 
visit, and my grandma would 
always joke about how Syria’s 
lack of efficient electricity, 
inconsistent running water 
and other low-quality literal 
necessities for life was a way of 
building character. Maybe she’s 
right; maybe they did build my 
character, maybe they gave 
me thicker skin, maybe I have 
been elevated by the dragging 
weights of inconvenience, but 
how much has being Syrian 
actually shaped me?
 I have only merely 
tasted Syria. I bared the 
inconvenience of not having 
central air conditioning and 
experienced showering in the 
cold, but I am still a fraud. As 
part of an earlier diaspora, I 
will never be in a position of a 
Syrian fleeing a war or a Syrian 
who grew up there. I will never 
know the extent of a true Syria, 
of both the pure and the ugly. 
If “justice too long delayed is 
justice denied,” then I have 
been denied the privilege 
of experiencing my culture 
firsthand.
 All my longing for Syria comes 
from a love I only experienced 
during my vacations. I have 
witnessed Syria firsthand but 
that is not the reason my heart 

aches for it. Like a visitor in a 
familiar home or finding home 
in unfamiliar lands, my feelings 
for a place far beyond are 
comprised of contradictions. If 
I were to be put on a spectrum, I 
would lie somewhere between 
informed tourist and distant 
citizen. I do not know of a 
Syria that I can call truly mine. 
When I am there my broken 
Arabic, my fluctuation between 
native and taught tongue, my 
relatively heavy accent make 
me outstanding. The type of 
outstanding that catches your 
eye, the plastered caution sign, 
“drive slow,” “no lifeguard on 
duty” kind of outstanding. The 
“tread carefully” and “parental 
discretion is advised” kind of 
outstanding. The “handle with 
care” and the “enter at your 
own risk” kind of outstanding. 
An outstanding that is enough 
to make you realize the very 
essence of who you are is scary 
to people who are not family.
 I am oil-hungry, I exploit 
others, I am here to make a 
mess of things, pick up none of 
my pieces and leave as though I 
was never there. I can afford my 
taxi fare and a tip to feed three 
families. I am there to reap the 
benefits of good food, nice tans 
and an annual dental checkup 
for the same price of a mediocre 
American-made, medium-well 
steak with fries on the side. 
Despite these preconceived, 
somewhat-accurate judgments 
and this underlying fear that 
turns me and all my red, white 
and blue apparel into a warning 
sign, I have never come back 
from Syria without a whole 
new group of friends I shared 
shawarma with on the side of 
the road.
 I have memories of strangers 
who became my teammates 
in afternoon soccer matches 
and kids I jumped rope with 
using 
a 
fallen 
abandoned 
powerline. I remember the 
owners of the corner stores I 
would walk to daily with my 
cousins not just by their names 
but by the freckle on their right 
cheek, or the dated spectacles 
they bear on their head, or 
the light-washed, thick, off-
brand Levi’s suspended by the 
tight grip of a bland black...

Kathryn Peterson is used to 
accolades.
The Michigan field hockey 
recruit — ranked No. 7 in the 
country according to MAX 
Field Hockey — has racked 
up 
an 
impressive 
resume 
before even setting foot on 
campus. A key member of 
title-contending teams from 
high school to club to the 
U19 National Team, Peterson 
has the potential to become 
a difference-maker even as a 
freshman.
Her high school — Serra 
High School in San Diego, 
Calif. — is nearly unstoppable. 
Ranked as the No. 8 high school 
team in the country and the 
best west of Washington, D. 
C., Serra went undefeated in 
the last two seasons and won 
their section championships 
all four years of Peterson’s 
high school career. Her senior 
year, she served as co-captain 
and scored 40 goals with 18 
assists.
Peterson’s club team, RUSH 
Field Hockey, won every game 
of the U19 Disney Showcase 
2018 and placed fifth last 
year at the U19 National Club 
Championships. Peterson is 
also a member of the USA 
Field Hockey U19 National 
Team — an elite squad that 
gets the opportunity to tour 
and compete internationally.

Peterson is a well-rounded, 
energetic athlete whose skills 
translate well to any team.
“She’s 
super 
creative, 
dynamic, on the ball,” said 
RUSH coach Brian Schledorn. 
“With ability to distribute 
long-range passing.”
Her versatility also enables 
teams to use her wherever 
she fits best, opening up more 
options for coaches. On her 
high school team, she played 
forward and midfield and 
with RUSH, she has played 
all 
three 
non-goalkeeper 
positions — forward, midfield 
and back.
“Personally, I like her in 
the 
midfield,” 
Schledorn 
said. 
“(But) 
for 
the 
U19 
National Team, she plays the 
forward line, and then I think 
potentially at Michigan she 
might play the defensive line.” 
(She is listed as a midfielder 
on MGoBlue.com.)
The Wolverines lost several 
top players to graduation last 
year — including midfielder 
and back Katie Trombetta 
and forward and midfielder 
Esther de Leijer. Like both 
players, Peterson is a skilled 
and versatile passer, and she 
can prove to be a threat on 
offense or defense.
Though 
comparisons 
to 
either player at this point 
would be unfair — Trombetta 
was an All-American and Big 
Ten Player of the Year and de 
Leijer was named to the All-

Big Ten and All-West Region 
Second Teams — Peterson has 
the skills of a potential elite 
player and as a top-ranked 
recruit, she will likely be 
given a chance to contribute 
right away.
Not only was Peterson a 
star on the field, she was 
named 
to 
the 
San 
Diego 
Union-Tribune All-Academic 
Team with a 4.64 grade-point 
average. Her academic and 
athletic achievements make 
her a good fit for Michigan. 
Many Division I field hockey 
programs are at small East 
Coast schools, but with her 
well-rounded 
interests, 
Peterson wanted something 
more.
“She wanted a big school,” 
Schledorn 
said. 
“A 
top-10 
contender.”
The Wolverines certainly 
check off both those boxes. 
Michigan 
had 
its 
most 
successful season in several 
years 
in 
2017, 
sweeping 
the Big Ten regular season 
and tournament titles and 
making a run all the way to 
the Final Four. And while 
the Wolverines lost several 
important 
pieces 
from 
last season in Trombetta, 
de Leijer, goalkeeper Sam 
Swenson and forward Carly 
Bennett, Peterson has the 
capability to become a key 
part of a young core striving 
to lead Michigan back to the 
heights of the sport.

‘M’ looks to improve on 
Big Ten success in 2018

More than 150 years ago, Charles 
Dickens unknowingly described the 
2017 Michigan men’s soccer team’s 
(6-1-1 Big Ten, 12-6-2 Overall) 2017 
season in 12 words as well as anyone 
today could in a thousand.
For much of last season, it was 
the best of times for the Wolverines. 
Needing a win against Maryland on 
the road, Michigan clinched its first 
Big Ten regular-season championship 
in program history on an overtime 
goal off the golden foot of MLS-bound 
forward Francis Atuahene. The 
Wolverines rose to as high as No. 10 in 
the United Soccer Coaches Poll, tied a 
program record with nine home wins 
and even held then-No. 1 Indiana to a 
1-1 draw, all after going 4-11-4 just a 
year prior.
With a first round bye in the NCAA 
Championship for the first time since 
2012, Michigan had lofty postseason 
hopes. Against Colgate in the second 
round, Michigan initially looked like 
the same strong team, scoring two 
goals in the first five minutes. The 
good times kept rolling. 
By the time the first half was 
over though, that 2-0 lead was gone. 
And by the time the clock ran out, 
Michigan’s tournament hopes were 
gone, a resurgent season squandered 
3-2 on a 87th-minute header from a 
team that finished .500 in the Patriot 
League. When it mattered most, it 
was the worst of times in Ann Arbor.
The 
past 
is 
not 
something 
Michigan can completely erase. 
However, the Wolverines return all 
but two players from last year’s team 
and have enough talent to bury last 
year’s painful exit under many more 
achievements. For all the heartbreak 
at the end of the season, not many 
predicted Michigan to even come 
close to where it did in the first 
place. The Daily breaks down how 
the Wolverines and Michigan coach 
Chaka Daley will look to continue 
their success and the obstacles they 
may face:
Positional Leaders:
With Atuahene’s departure to 
FC Dallas, Daley will lean even 
more heavily on junior forward Jack 
Hallahan, who led the team in points 
(25), goals (nine) and assists (7), and 
was named First Team All-Big Ten. 
Sophomore Mohammed Zakyi scored 
six goals of his own to pace the rest of 

the team and should slip right into the 
forward spot vacated by Atuahene.
Other than that, the rest of the team 
remains largely the same from last 
year. Senior Robbie Mertz returns to 
the midfield as last season’s co-MVP 
with 
Hallahan, 
accompanied 
by fellow senior Ivo Cerda and 
sophomore Marc Ybarra, the latter of 
whom started all but two games as a 
freshman and played a crucial role as 
the team’s free-kicker from distance. 
Both Zakyi and Ybarra were named 
to the Big Ten All-Freshman Team.
On the back end, senior and 
Second Team All-Big Ten Marcello 
Borges returns as the best defender. 
In 15 starts, Borges was the anchor 
of a Wolverines defense that allowed 
multiple goals in only four games and 
ranked fourth in the Big Ten with a 
1.138 goals against average.
What is Michigan’s biggest 
question going into the season?
The goalie situation.
Then-sophomore 
goalkeeper 
Andrew Verdi came into the season 
as the starter, starting thirteen games 
for Michigan and allowing fourteen 
goals. After a 3-1 loss to No. 7 Notre 
Dame, however, the Wolverines 
turned 
to 
freshman 
goalkeeper 
Henry Mashburn, who started off 
strong with three goals allowed in five 
games. Mashburn, though, allowed 
four goals in a loss to Wisconsin in the 
Big Ten Tournament, and three more 
in Michigan’s ultimate match against 
Colgate.
Will the Wolverines turn back to 
Verdi and put their unfortunate end 
to last season in the rear-view mirror? 
Or will they build on that late season 
success with Mashburn and develop 
him as the goalie of the future?
Schedule analysis:
Michigan will play 17 regular 
season fixtures, with twelve of 
those matches being at U-M Soccer 
Stadium. Of their five true road 
games, two of those are also in state — 
at Oakland and Michigan State for the 
Big Bear trophy.
The Wolverines would benefit 
from a fast start, however, because the 
end of their schedule doesn’t do them 
any favors. To end the regular season, 
Michigan plays five of their final six 
matches against teams that they lost 
to last season — vs. Indiana, vs. Notre 
Dame, at Wisconsin, at Michigan 
State and vs. Maryland. All of those 
teams were ranked in the top 10 at 
some point of last season.

AMELIA CACCHIONE / DAILY
Freshman defenseman Quinn Hughes was drafted 7th overall by the Vancouver Canucks in the NHL Draft after a breakout year
Quinn Hughes taken 7th by Canucks

The past year has been a wild 
ride for Quinn Hughes.
As 
the 
youngest 
player 
in 
college 
hockey last season, the 18-year-
old freshman defenseman helped 
lead the Michigan 
hockey 
team 
— 
13-game winners 
the season prior 
— to the Frozen 
Four, 
all 
the 
while 
wowing 
Wolverines 
fans 
and 
NHL 
scouts with his 
electrifying 
skating and puck-
handling ability.
Soon, the ride 
will take him to Canada.
On Friday night in Dallas, 
Texas, Hughes was selected by 
the Vancouver Canucks with the 
7th pick in the 2018 National 
Hockey League Draft.
Hughes is the highest Michigan 
draftee since defenseman Jack 
Johnson was taken third overall 
by 
the 
Carolina 
Hurricanes 
in 2005 and is also the second 
defenseman chosen in this year’s 
draft after Rasmus Dahlin, who 
went to the Buffalo Sabres with 
the No. 1 overall selection.
Joining Hughes in attendance 
at the American Airlines Center 
was his entire family, including 
his brothers Jack — a candidate 
to be next year’s top NHL draft 

pick — and Luke, who recently 
committed 
to 
Michigan 
for 
2022. Hughes’ parents were both 
hockey players as well — father 
Jim at Providence and mother 
Ellen at New Hampshire.
After Hughes was drafted, 
he spoke to NBCSN’s Kathryn 
Tappen 
about 
the 
impact 
of 
his mother, who 
taught him how 
to skate when he 
was little.
“It’s 
always 
nice 
to 
have 
parents that know 
what 
they’re 
doing,” he said. 
“It always makes 
a difference. I’m 
obviously grateful 
to both of them — my mom knows 
a lot about the game, like I said, 
I’m grateful.”
Just about every mock draft 
had Hughes as a top-10 pick, with 
the most common projections 
coming in the No. 4-No. 8 range. 
Considering 
his 
skills 
and 
production last season, these 
projections made sense.
Hughes’ standout trait is his 
skating — many outlets have 
called him the best pure skater 
in his class. Blessed with terrific 
speed and acceleration, he’s a 
terror in transition, and his puck-
handling and passing allow him 
to quarterback an offense from 
the blue line effectively.
His elite skating does come 

with a cost — at just 5-foot-
9, Hughes lacks the size many 
desire from a defenseman and 
can be outmuscled at times. 
But he compensates for it with 
superior awareness and savvy 
anticipation, and pairing him 
with a larger, more physical blue-
liner — such as his partnership 
with Joseph Cecconi last season 
— neutralizes many of Hughes’ 
weaknesses.
Hughes’ 
talent 
culminated 
last season into five goals and 
a team-high 24 assists, as well 
as selections to the All-Big Ten 
Second Team and All-Freshman 
Team. After Michigan’s season 
came to an end, he was named to 
the United States national team 
at the World Championships as 
the only college player on the 
roster, contributing to a bronze-
medal finish for the Americans.
It’s not yet clear what Hughes’ 
next move will be. Most analysts 
believe he’s in need of at least one 
more year of in college in order 
to get stronger and develop his 
defensive game. His performance 
with Team USA, however, hints 
that he isn’t far off from being 
NHL-ready.
But for now, Hughes seems to 
just be enjoying it all.
“Obviously, I’m very proud,” 
Hughes said. “I’ve heard a lot of 
great things about Vancouver, it’s 
obviously a hockey market. I’m 
really excited, and it’s a dream 
come true. Honestly, I don’t know 
what to say right now.”

Focus on fundamentals 
helps Conry in first year

On 
the 
surface, 
it’s 
not 
immediately 
obvious 
what 
drew Kevin Conry to coach the 
Michigan men’s lacrosse team.
He 
came 
to 
Ann 
Arbor 
after spending five years as 
the defensive coordinator at 
Maryland. In his five years, 
the Terrapins won the Big 
Ten Tournament five times 
and reached the Final Four of 
the NCAA Tournament four 
times — including winning the 
National Championship in 2017.
In the five years before 
Conry joined the Wolverines, 
Michigan notched just one win 
in the Big Ten and one winning 
season.
That’s a big leap for any 
coach to make — a perennial 
powerhouse to a team still 
trying to find consistent wins. 
It’s an even bigger leap when 
you’re going to your first head 
coaching job.
“I think when you’re in this 
business, you want to be a head 
coach, but you don’t want to 
sacrifice an option to be ahead 
of the pack and be a part of a 
winning organization,” Conry 
said. “I was an assistant at 
Maryland. We were going to 
Final Fours, just coming off a 
championship, so it was very 
easy for me to stay there.
“But 
when 
you 
look 
at 
Michigan, 
all 
that 
it 
had 
academically, in the Big Ten 
conference which is the best 
lacrosse in the country, coupled 
with all of the facilities that 
are available and that were 
gonna come online in a very 
short amount of time, it was a 
no-brainer for me.”
Conry’s first season at the 
helm was a bit of a rollercoaster—
as is to be expected for a young 
team and a new coach learning 
together.
Culture 
change 
is 
not 
a 
process that happens overnight, 
though 
Conry 
is 
quick 
to 
point out that he was merely 
building on the foundation left 
by the previous coaching staff. 
But new coaches bring new 
philosophies, and Conry has 
been steadfast in his since Day 
1.

“It was about having 46 guys 
buy into an idea and a plan 
and a process,” Conry said. 
“Every day — we certainly had 
our rollercoaster ride of a full 
season — but we had guys who 
wanted to be great, wanted to 
buy in, and wanted to have the 
success on the field and off 
the field. We just helped them 
to find the way, and once they 
started 
to 
understand 
how 
to do it, it started to become 
habit. 
And 
that’s 
what 
we 
really wanted, to just trust the 
process, get better every day. 
Culture will come when they 
understand and when they buy 
in.”
Creating a team that trusted 
his process and was willing to 
work was Conry’s top priority 
in his first year. After all, it’s 
hard to have high expectations 
of a team that has only had one 
previous winning season.
“I knew we had to just 
continually get better,” Conry 
said. 
“I 
didn’t 
really 
have 
many expectations per se, I 
just wanted us to focus on the 
process and say, ‘Every day, let’s 
just get a little bit better, and 
then we’ll worry about the wins 
and losses when they come.’ ”
Despite 
the 
lack 
of 
expectations, Conry led the 
Wolverines to arguably their 
most 
successful 
season 
in 
history.
Michigan 
started 
5-0 
at 
home — a program record. One 
of their two non-conference 
losses came against Yale, the 
eventual national champions. 
The Wolverines went on the 
road to then-No. 4 Notre Dame 
and won, earning Michigan’s 
first top-five win and first road 
win over a ranked opponent in 
program history.
But the Big Ten is one of the 
most competitive conferences 
in collegiate lacrosse — on 
multiple 
occasions 
during 
the 
season, 
all 
six 
teams 
were ranked inside the top 
20. 
Though 
the 
Wolverines 
had found success in non-
conference games, Big Ten play 
brought growing pains and the 
first real tastes of adversity.

MEN’S LACROSSE 

BAILEY JOHNSON
Daily Sports Writer


The past week has been a whirlwind 
for Michigan Athletics. From elite 
talent leaving the campus in Ann Arbor 
to promising young stars entering it, 
there has been a lot to smile about for 
the Wolverine faithful.
It seems fitting that an academic 
year 
filled 
with 
excitement 
for 
Michigan teams would feature a 
similar level of off-season drama. This 
past year, Wolverine squads performed 
miraculous postseason runs, strung 
together awe-inspiring win streaks and 
even boasted a national champion.
There’s no doubt that this level of 
sustained success has inspired current 
and future generations of Michigan 
fans and student-athletes. And that 
inspiration has played out in a flurry 
of off-season news. The Daily breaks 
down the five events in five days 
that defined the upcoming season of 
Wolverine Athletics.
June 21st: Moe Wagner drafted 
25th overall
Further filling the Michigan-to-
NBA pipeline is now-former Wolverine 
guard Moe Wagner. The 6’11” German-
native was selected by the Los Angeles 
Lakers with the 25th pick in the draft.
Wagner has had a dream career 
with Michigan, leading his teams to 
back-to-back Big Ten titles in 2017 and 

2018 and an appearance in the national 
title game.
Wagner led the team with 14.6 
points and 7.1 rebounds per game in his 
final year with the Wolverines. His elite 
blend of post moves and three-point 
ability made him a unique talent that 
the Lakers just couldn’t pass up.
Wagner’s 
first-round 
selection 
makes him the seventh first-round 
selection in the last six years from 
Michigan under head coach John 
Beilein, further cementing the elite 
status of the men’s basketball program 
in collegiate circles.
As Wagner now looks to undertake 
bigger and better things, the new 
wave of talent entered Crisler Center 
this week as well. A highly-touted 
recruiting class will now play under 
Beilein featuring top-tier in-state 
talents Brendan Johns and David 
DeJulius who hope to hear their names 
called at the draft some day.
June 
22nd: 
Quinn 
Hughes 
selected 7th overall
Not to be shown up, Quinn Hughes 
wanted to represent Michigan well at 
the NHL Draft where he was selected 
7th overall by the Vancouver Canucks.
Hughes was the second defenseman 
taken off the board, coming in behind 
the No. 1 overall pick Rasmus Dahlin 
who is largely touted as a once-in-a-
generation defenseman.
Projected to be selected in the No. 

4 - No. 8 range in the draft, Hughes fell 
a few spots before the Canucks stole 
Hughes at No. 7.
As a freshman and the youngest 
hockey player in the NCAA, Hughes 
anchored an elite Michigan defensive 
line with his unrivaled speed and vision 
for the game. Using his famed skating 
ability, Hughes thrives in transition and 
will look to quarterback Vancouver’s 
defensive line of the future.
Scoring five goals and 24 assists in 
his first season with the Wolverines, 
the only downside to Hughes’ game 
appears to be his size. Coming in at 5’10” 
and 175-lbs. Hughes will undoubtedly 
need to bulk up before he’s ready for 
the bruising size of the average NHL 
player.
From here, Hughes’ future is 
uncertain. His next step will either 
be to play another year at Michigan 
to develop his game or see if he’s truly 
ready for the next level.
June 22nd: Chris Webber accepts 
invitation to return to Michigan
On 
Friday, 
former 
Wolverine 
basketball 
legend 
Chris 
Webber 
agreed to return to Ann Arbor to be 
an honorary captain for the Michigan 
football team next season.
Since his time on the Fab Five in 
the early 1990’s, Webber has yet to set 
foot on campus or reunite with his 
old teammates since he was banished 
from Michigan for 10 years. The exile 

came after Webber committed NCAA 
violations during his time in college and 
an illicit involvement with booster Ed 
Martin — a scandal that saw Webber 
plead guilty for criminal contempt in 
2002.
After the ban was lifted in 2013, 
Webber’s return marks the beginning 
of healing for a period of Wolverine 
history mired in regret.
“I want every player that ever 
played here to feel like he’s a part of the 
building, including Chris and anyone 
else,” Beilein said. “And we’re a part 
of your program, and that’s the never 
ending quest with every player, not just 
Chris and the Fab Five. We’re really 
looking forward to the day we get him 
back here.”
June 24th: Michigan football 
lands three big recruits
For a team struggling to find NCAA 
success and desperately trying to will 
itself into the playoffs, it all starts with 
recruiting. Particularly, getting high-
level recruits to choose your program 
over the likes of your biggest rivals.
And that’s exactly what Michigan 
accomplished on Sunday.
The Wolverines hauled in three 
recruits highlighted by four-stars Mazi 
Smith and Zach Charbonnet playing 
defensive tackle and running back, 
respectively.
Both 
coming 
from 
in-state 
programs, Smith and Charbonnet add 

to an already stacked 2019 recruiting 
class and bring Michigan coach Jim 
Harbaugh’s in-state recruit total to 
seven.
Now, according to 247sports.com, 
the Wolverines have the fifth-ranked 
2019 recruiting class and the highest-
ranked class in the Big Ten.
Joining Smith and Charbonnet in 
committing to Michigan on Sunday 
is three-star tight end Erick All Jr. 
who will add even more depth in the 
Wolverines’ locker room.
Prior to the surge of commits, the 
recruiting tone was set early that 
weekend with three-star safety Joey 
Velazquez committing to Michigan to 
play football and baseball, bringing the 
weekend commitment total to four.
June 25th: Wolverines add yet 
another recruit
But Harbaugh wasn’t done there.
The very next day, three-star 
cornerback D.J. Turner III announced 
his intent to play with Michigan via 
Instagram. The commitment brought 
the Wolverines’ recruiting rampage 
total to five on the weekend and 
elevated their ranking to fifth overall.
From 
Thursday 
to 
Monday, 
Michigan was gifted with good news 
after good news from the old to the 
new. From watching its stars go to the 
pros or watching new ones come in, this 
weekend will certainly be referred to as 
a turning point for Michigan Athletics.
