COLUMBUS — The No. 4 

Michigan football team was just 
hanging on.

Even when the Wolverines 

went down two touchdowns 
in the first half, and even when 
momentum favored Ohio State 
to begin the second half, they 
hung perilously within reaching 
distance.

But with just under five 

minutes left in the third quarter, 
the floodgates broke open.

It came on a punt, just after 

Michigan had gone down, 27-19, 
on a Buckeye field goal. Ohio State 
receiver Chris Olave took a free 
run at junior punter Will Hart 
and blocked Hart’s kick.

The ball deflected high into 

the air and directly into the 
outstretched arms of Buckeye 
cornerback Sevyn Banks, who 
took it untouched to the house.

The Wolverines had finally 

wilted, like they have against 
Ohio State in 14 of the teams’ last 
15 matchups, and from there they 
could do nothing right, losing, 
62-39.

“It was tough,” said senior 

safety Tyree Kinnel. “We try to 
stay upbeat throughout the whole 
game and trust each other and 
stay in the fight. But I remember a 
point where it just got out of hand. 
Slowly devastated us throughout 
the game. All the yards they were 
putting up, how easily they were 
scoring, it was tough. Extremely 
tough.”

The out-of-hand point may 

have been the punt, or really any 
point after that, but the sings of 
impending trouble were present 
from the beginning.

Michigan started the game 

with the ball and a three-and-out, 
and the Buckeyes promptly drove 
43 yards for a score immediately 
afterward, finishing it off with a 
touchdown to Olave.

Olave, who entered the game 

with four catches all season, 
tacked on another score with 
9:08 left in the second quarter, 
and Ohio State threatened to 
break the game open when 
wide receiver Johnnie Dixon III 
caught a wide-open touchdown 
to extend the Buckeye lead to 21-6 
minutes later.

To these opening blows, the 

Wolverines had answers.

They scored back with a 

fade-route 
touchdown 
from 

sophomore wide receiver Nico 
Collins. Then, on the ensuing 
kickoff, Ohio State kick returner 
Demario McCall simply dropped 
the ball and Michigan recovered 
on 
the 
Buckeyes’ 
nine-yard 

line. Junior running back Chris 
Evans caught a wheel route for a 
touchdown on the next snap, and 
despite failing to convert on the 
two-point conversion attempt, 
the Wolverines were suddenly 
down just two.

Ohio 
State 
drove 
down 

to Michigan’s two-yard line 
twice in its next three offensive 
possessions, but had to settle for 
field goals both times.

“We had our opportunities 

offensively, and you know, the 
defense started the second half 
good and held them to a field 
goal and got a stop, and we had a 
chance,” Patterson said.

That’s 
when 
Olave 
broke 

through the Wolverines’ punt 
protection, 
and 
Banks 
went 

dancing into the endzone.

Junior 
quarterback 
Shea 

Patterson threw an interception 
three plays later, and the Buckeyes 
scored two snaps after that. 

As Kinnel put it, things were 

out of hand.

“You know, sometimes you 

get desperate in those types of 
situations,” Patterson said of 
his interception. “Wasn’t really 
trying to force it, I was actually 
trying to throw the ball out of 
bounds. Whoever made that play 
made a good play and hit my 

elbow.”

One last time, Michigan drove 

down the field in an effort to 
battle back, and Collins secured 
another fade route to chop the 
deficit back to two scores.

And then Ohio State wide 

receiver Parris Campell Jr., took 
the first play on the Buckeyes’ next 
drive 78 yards to the endzone.

In the end, the statistics are 

hideous 
for 
the 
Wolverines. 

They gave up the most points of 
any regulation game in program 
history. Ever. They allowed the 
most yards (567) since coach 
Jim Harbaugh and defensive 
coordinator Don Brown have 
taken over. They gave it all up in 
their biggest game of the year.

After Campbell’s run, the 

metaphorical floodgates were 
completely obliterated.

Ohio State spent the rest of 

the game scoring and breaking 
records 
offensively, 
while 

pumping up the crowd and 
dancing on graves defensively.

As the result of a unanimous 

vote by the Ann Arbor City 
Council at a recent meeting, 
the City now has to disclose 
information regarding where 
lead 
materials 
have 
been 

used in the Ann Arbor water 
system.

At last Monday’s meeting, 

councilmembers 
gave 
city 

staff until the end of the year 
to produce the information, 
which identifies places where 
some homeowners may be 
exposed lead contamination 
and need to replace their 
water 
service 
lines. 
The 

decision follows a Freedom of 
Information Act request filed 
by the Ann Arbor News and 
MLive. The city originally 
asked for a payment of $667.94 
for copies of the records, but at 
the meeting last Monday, the 

council voted to waive the fee.

City Councilmember Jack 

Eaton, D-Ward 4, said it was 
important to waive the costs 
given the funding constraints 
of local media outlets.

“I think that all of us are 

aware of the dire economic 
circumstances of local media,” 
Eaton said. “Newspapers are 
struggling to survive in small 
communities like this, and it’s 
so essential that a community 
like 
ours 
have 
a 
good, 

healthy paper. We shouldn’t 
burden our local newspaper 
unnecessarily.”

Eaton 
also 
noted 
the 

state 
law 
regarding 

public 
documents 
favored 

disclosure, adding the city 
itself sometimes struggled to 
disseminate information.

“Any opportunity that we 

have, we should cooperate 
with 
the 
local 
media 
in 

their attempts to take city 

As 
Ann 
Arbor’s 
fourth 

annual deer cull approaches, some 
have raised concerns regarding 
the safety of donating venison to 
local soup kitchens. Many deer 
in the area drink from the Huron 
River, which the Department of 
Environmental 
Quality 
found 

this summer contains the toxic 
chemical perfluorooctanesulfonic 
acid, or PFAS.

In 
October, 
the 
Michigan 

Department of Natural Resources 
and the Department of Health and 
Human Services issued a “Do Not 
Eat” advisory for deer within five 
miles of Clark’s Marsh in Oscoda 
Township due to PFAS levels 
found in the animals. Though the 
Huron River contains some PFAS, 
Hayner said the Clark’s Marsh area 
provided the deer with a uniquely 
high amount of PFAS exposure.

Ann Arbor to publicize information 
on lead in pipes after state tightens regs

City initially requested processing fee for Ann Arbor News FOIA request

LEAH GRAHAM 
Daily Staff Reporter

Under the surface of Lake Erie 

lies a vast and complex ecosystem 
of plants and animals. In a recent 
study, University of Michigan 
scientists dove into the biology 
of the lake’s algae population to 
better understand the catalyst 
of their summer blooms and the 
potential hazards they pose to 
the environment.

According to a University press 

release, the study — conducted 
by the University’s Cooperative 
Institute 
for 
Great 
Lakes 

Research — found cyanobacteria 
cells to be the cause of Lake Erie’s 
summer algal blooms. Over two 
years, researchers evaluated the 
sediment-core of 16 sites up to 30 
feet deep over 145 square miles 
in the lake’s western area, as it 
has been greatly affected by the 
blooms.

The 
team 
identified 

cyanobacteria cells as the culprit 
for summer blooms, surviving 
at the bottom of the lake during 
the winter and reemerging in the 
spring. 

According 
to 
an 

announcement 
from 
the 

marching 
band, 
Maggie 
St. 

Clair, director of Operations for 
the Michigan Marching Band, 
unexpectedly passed away after 
a medical emergency Saturday 
morning just before leaving 
for the Michigan v. Ohio State 
football game.

 Marching Band Drum Major 

Kelly Bertoni, an LSA junior, 
said working with St. Clair on 
Fridays was her favorite time of 
day because of St. Clair’s caring 
personality.

“Every Friday I would go in 

was just the highlight of my 
day,” Bertoni said. “It was a time 
where we would just talk and 
catch up on life things and then 
go to work.”

“Kelly, where’s my hug for the 

day?”

This is what St. Clair would 

ask Bertoni as she came in to 
help St. Clair with the marching 
band’s finances and office work 
every Friday.

Michigan embarrassed by Ohio State, 62-39

information 
and 
digest 
it 

and disseminate it to the 
public, and this is that kind 
of circumstance,” Eaton said. 
“This particular Freedom of 
Information Act request asked 
for the location of everywhere 
in the city that the city has 
removed 
lead 
gooseneck 

connections from the water 
main to the home’s supply 
line, and it also asks for the 
location of every home that 
has galvanized pipe from the 
water main at the street to the 
house.”

The decision to release 

the 
information 
comes 

after the state put stricter 
lead 
regulations 
in 

place. 
In 
June, 
Michigan 

started enforcing the toughest 
laws in the country for lead 
levels 
in 
drinking 
water 

following 
the 
Flint 
water 

crisis, in which the city’s 
thousands of residents have 
been exposed to lead from the 
city’s water pipes. The rules 
dropped the “action level” 
at which utilities must take 

corrective action from the 
federal limit of 15 parts of 
lead per billion to 12 ppb by 

2025. The rules prohibited 
the partial alteration of lead 
pipes save for emergencies, 
while lead service lines buried 
underground are set to be 
switched out by 2040.

According to city officials, 

all known lead elements have 
been taken out of Ann Arbor’s 
water 
system. 
However, 

galvanized supply lines that 
remain in place could still 
retain 
lead, 
which 
could 

contaminate drinking water.

Eaton said the location of 

the lead goosenecks the city 
has replaced should be “readily 
available.” He added he did not 
believe the city should charge 
the newspaper for the costs 
involved in completing a list 
of these locations when he felt 
the city should have compiled 
the list itself anyway.

City Administrator Howard 

Lazarus said he worried about 
the precedent this would set 
for future FOIA requests, 
saying covering the cost could 

change the intention of 
future requests.

“While I recognize the 

intent of Councilmember 
Eaton’s 
desire, 
there 

are very real concerns 
about this,” Lazarus said. 
“Many times we hear 
council talk about the 
slippery slope. This is a 
slippery slope. The ability 
to recover costs from a 
FOIA request is in many 
ways a counter that keeps 
the FOIA process from 
being used as punitive 
and disruptive, and these 
$400 is something that a 
for-profit such as MLive 
ought to be able cover and 
it is, in fact, consistent 
with past practice.”

Lazarus 
rejected 
a 

fee waiver in October, 
maintaining the $667.94 
was 
necessary 
to 

reimburse 
Ann 
Arbor 

for the time the city’s 
public services manager 
would have to dedicate to 
locating the information. 

However, the Ann Arbor News 
argued the law bars a public 
entity from charging more 
than the hourly pay of the 
lowest-paid employee capable 
of 
handling 
the 
request. 

The city then dropped the 
fee to $409.71 and assigned 
a 
different 
employee 
to 

complete the task.

Both Councilmember Julie 

Grand, D-Ward 3, and City 
Attorney 
Stephen 
Postema 

echoed 
Lazarus’s 
concerns 

about waiving the FOIA fee, 
saying continuing to do so 
for other requests would be 
untenable. 
Councilmember 

Chip 
Smith, 
D-Ward 
5, 

added an amendment to the 
resolution to waive the FOIA 
fee to make the compiled 
information 
suitable 
for 

distribution to all of the 
public, as opposed to just 
being provided to MLive.

Transparency 
in 
city 

government 
has 
been 
a 

campaign 
issue 
of 
City 

Council 
candidates 
for 

years, 
and 
the 
council 

has debatedFOIA fee waivers 
in the past. Councilmember 
Ali Ramlawi, D-Ward 5, said 
there was a greater urgency 
for government transparency 
after the Flint water crisis. 

“Many in the community 

are 
asking 
for 
greater 

transparency 
and 
greater 

public safety in light of what 
happened in Flint,” Ramlawi 
said.

Councilmember Elizabeth 

Nelson, D-Ward 4, said she 
had heard concerns among 
residents about the lack of 
information.

“I 
think 
it 
would 
be 

helpful,” Nelson said. “It’s 
probably information that the 
city had to compile anyway, 
and making it public would 
be useful to know what time 
period of homes is most likely 
to be affected, if there are 
patterns to which homes had 
this problem address already 
or still need it to be addressed.”

Michigan in Color
Monday, November 26, 2018— 3A

Nestled in the dirt, under the roots 
of a date tree
Half of my heart waits
Calling out to me desperately
 
I’m walking, earbuds in
Down the streets of a city I don’t 
think wants me 
 
My feet hit the pavement to the 
rhythm of music 
In words that aren’t my mother 
tongue
 
While my mother’s tongue struggles 
to pronounce the words that make 
up this new land
Hard L’s and unrolled R’s and 
sounds that warp her name
Twisting, turning, tangling until 
they weave something that makes 
the most familiar parts of herself 
seem like strangers
And
 
I wonder if
Home sounds the same to her in 
this other language
In this other world
Where neighbors are distant and 
the family that moved with her is 
the only proof of the dusty streets 
she used to live on 
Where golden shrines that used 
to dot the city, like glimpses into 
heaven 
Were filled with throngs of people, 
crushing together to get closer to 
God, to each other, to the promise 
of forever
And if the only promises she knows 
now are the ones that were never 
kept
 
I wonder if
My father hunched and shoveling 
the mounds of snow that taunt him 
every winter
Remembers the feeling of the desert 
that used to warm his feet
As he played soccer, shooting goals 
the way he later had to shoot guns 

If every time he watches the 
news, he remembers the feeling of 
shrapnel piercing his chest, or
If, every time he bites into American 
fruit,
He remembers the fruit picked 
fresh off the tree of his family home, 
sweet juices dribbling down his 
chin
And tastes the nostalgia
 
I wonder if 
Every time the words of their 
mother language die on their 
tongues, my siblings are reminded 
of the graveyard their mouths have 
become
Or if they are homesick for a home 
they’ve never set foot in,
If they set a seat at the table for 
the distant relative who will never 
come
And stare at the empty seat and feel 
an anger as consuming as the wars 
that tore their homeland apart,
Wars that left their parents walking 
on the earth as strangers
Floating between two worlds
Always islands 
I wonder if they still know that love 
isn’t always a four-letter word
Or that words can say things, but 
they can’t feel things
That the ache in their chest from 
missing something makes it real 
And that, just because something is 
missing, doesn’t mean it’s gone,
 
I wonder if I —
The music stops
Underneath the palm tree, half of 
my heart is wailing,
Railing against its earthen confines 
But its voice is muffled against the 
dirt
“Come back to me,” it begs
But I am deaf to its noise
 
I press play again and keep walking 
in the wrong direction
Contemplating homesickness in the 
wrong language

Longing

MiC Contributor

How did you hear about 

your internship?

The 
Human 
Rights 

Campaign has always been an 
organization I have wanted to 
work in, either for an internship 
or for a career. As for my specific 
position, I actually didn’t go 
through the typical application 
process. I connected through 
an alum who happened to be 
the internship manager and she 
was kind enough to take me into 
her department! So, for half of 
my internship, I worked under 
her as the Pride and Events 
Intern and as the Outreach and 
Engagement Intern under a 
different supervisor.

What made you want to 

apply?

When 
I 
started 
my 

sophomore year, I came in with 
the goal of interning with a 
major non-profit for summer 
2018 and interning with a 
major corporation for summer 
2019. For choosing my non-
profit, I wanted to intern for 
an organization that not only 
grew me professionally but also 
broadened my understanding 
of society and how I operate in 
it. I identify as a heterosexual 

cis-gender Black woman, and 
it has been an informative and 
transformational 
experience 

uncovering the privileges that 
I have been navigating in my 
daily life. While 
I 
have 
many 

thoughts 
on 

navigating life as 
a Black woman, 
I 
have 
not 

reflected enough 
on 
how 
my 

more privileged 
identities, 
such 

as 
my 
sexual 

orientation, 
play 
an 
equal 

role in shaping 
how I navigate 
the 
world. 

Additionally, 
I 

wanted to find 
more 
strategic 

ways to combat 
homophobia 
in 
the 
Black 

community 
as 

it is still an issue that plagues 
Black culture. 

What are your favorite 

memories 
from 
your 

experience?

My 
favorite 
experience 

from 
my 
internship 
was 

the Washington, D.C. Pride 
Festival. Under my internship 

title, 
my 
responsibilities 

included 
planning 
and 

overseeing the logistics of pride 
festivals all over the nation. 
It was an amazing experience 

to be able to see 
both the behind-
the-scenes 
work 
behind 

pride 
festival 

participation 
and the physical, 
colorful 
manifestation of 
months’ work. I 
had so much fun 
and I loved being 
able to enjoy the 
music, 
dancing 

and 
diverse 

representation of 
experiences that 
are 
frequently 

dismissed 
and 

ignored 
during 

other 
festival 

environments.

What 
is 

the 
culture 
like 
where 

you interned? Any advice 
for 
prospective 
interns 

interested in non-profits?

Imagine 
the 
type 
of 

workplace 
that 
your 
high 

school pushed onto you as an 
explanation for enforcing the 
school dress code. Now imagine 

the opposite. That is the culture 
at HRC. In the 90-degree heat, 
HRC 
prioritized 
employee 

comfort over rigid dress code 
systems. I was able to do my key 
work responsibilities in shorts 
and sneakers. I appreciated how 
HRC trusted their employees 
to know when to dress up and 
when to dress down.

The work culture also made 

sure to prioritize active over 
passive action. Multiple times 
my job called for dropping 
my work and heading to the 
Supreme Court and the Capitol 
to 
protest 
unjust 
politics. 

The work was challenging 
and 
emotionally 
draining, 

but it is imperative that large 
organizations such as HRC 
have an active field experience.

I would encourage anyone 

who 
wants 
to 
intern 
at 

non-profits 
to 
utilize 
(the 

University 
of) 
Michigan’s 

large 
alumni 
network 
and 

just reach out yourself! I got 
this incredible internship by 
networking on LinkedIn, and 
if I can do it, anyone else can as 
well! I would also invite anyone 
to contact me at any time with 
any additional questions they 
have about HRC. I would be so 
happy to answer.

This past summer, I went on a 

Global Intercultural 

Experience 
for 

Undergraduates study abroad 
service trip to Cusco, Peru. To be 
completely honest, I chose this 
country mainly because I wanted 
to see Machu Picchu and because 
I’ve always wanted to go to South 
America as well. I didn’t really 
know much about Peru or Cusco 
prior to getting into the program 
and attending the learning team 
meetings.

The work we were doing on 

this trip involved getting up 
early every day, a lot of mud and 
a lot of manual labor. Still fresh 
in my mind are the squeals of 
the guinea pigs and the chirps 
of the baby chicks that we had to 
try not to step on while working 
inside people’s homes in the rural 
mountainside of Peru. Other vivid 
memories I have are throwing up 
on buses, hearing my groupmates 
throwing up on buses, nights 
in the San Jose Clinic with an 
IV attached to my arm and 
headaches so strong I thought I 
might faint. Of course, that’s not 
what I chose to showcase on my 
social media, but a lot of the times 
it was not easy. Between the high 
altitude and the freezing nights, 

and half of our group contracting 
salmonella, I can’t say we didn’t 
experience 
hardships 
during 

this trip. I’m not going to lie and 
say it was all glamorous and 
Instagram, travel-blog worthy. 
I’m not going to lie and say I didn’t 
have a few mental breakdowns, 
go to sleep shivering under 
several blankets riddled with 
homesickness or daydream about 
Arabic food.

What 
I’m 

also not going 
to do is gush 
about how this 
experience 
made 
me 
so 

much 
more 

thankful 
for 

what I have, 
because 
that 

was 
not 
the 

purpose of this 
trip. 
Before 

embarking, a lot 
of our learning 
team meetings 
stressed 
the 
importance 
of 

abandoning the “white savior” 
mentality and not going in 
with the intention of “fixing” 
a community that was doing a 
perfectly fine job at making a 
life for themselves. The purpose 
of this trip was to become fully 
immersed in a country and its 
culture, to partake in a mutually 
beneficial 
relationship 
and 

to work with a community to 

better their conditions while 
simultaneously 
learning 
and 

gaining 
firsthand 
experience 

in a culture a world away from 
our own. Most of the time I was 
there, I felt as though I was the 
one that needed help or guidance, 
not the other way around.

However, my time in Peru 

did provide me with countless 
worthwhile 
memories 
and 

valuable 
insights. 

While the language 
barrier 
often 

made it difficult to 
understand 
each 

other, I learned that 
communication 
transcends 
verbal 

expression. 
The 

universal languages 
of 
compassion, 

kindness 
and 

hospitality seeped 
through the cracks 
of broken Spanish 
and 
confused 

pauses. I felt it 

when the locals in the homes we 
worked in brought us potatoes 
and popcorn and rushed to get us 
mud and rocks when we ran out. 
I felt it when my 7-year-old host 
sister hugged me after I walked 
in the door at night and when 
my host mom put a jar of olives 
on the dining table every day 
after learning I liked olives. I felt 
it when taxi drivers tried their 
best to converse with me using 

slow, simple Spanish, trying their 
best to understand me and learn 
where I was from and what I was 
doing in Peru. Being the only 
visible Muslim in seemingly the 
entire country made me nervous 
and self-conscious at times, and 
while I certainly felt out of place, 
I never once felt unwelcomed.

People always say studying 

abroad changes your life. I don’t 
know if my trip “changed my life” 
per se, but it definitely changed 
me. It made me more adaptable, 
more equipped to deal with 
uncomfortable 
situations 
and 

being unsure. It gave me amazing 
friends that I wouldn’t have 
met otherwise. It allowed me 
to basically live like a local for a 
month, becoming fully immersed 
in this country by learning 
about its history and interacting 
with its people. It challenged 
me to adapt to an unusual 
setting rather than expecting 
my surroundings to adapt to 
me, as Americans often do. I 
think everybody should study 
abroad at some point in their 
undergraduate career, if able to. If 
it does anything, it changes your 
perspective on travel and being a 
tourist, volunteer, voluntourist or 
whatever it may be. My advice to 
anyone who is going on a service 
trip or study abroad experience 
is to take all the expectations 
you have prior to embarking 
on the trip and dispose of them 
entirely. It is best to go in with a 
fresh mind and open heart, ready 
to take on whatever challenges 
and triumphs the country and 
your program throw at you. Be 
open, be present, be respectful 
and mindful, try to learn and 
practice the language while 
you’re there, show gratitude, 
show 
humility. 
Remember 

that what distinguishes you 
from just an average, mindless 
tourist is your desire to truly 
learn about and understand the 
place you are in — its history 
and cultures and traditions and 
people and struggles. Remember 
your experience is partly what 
is planned on your agenda and 
mostly 
the 
unfiltered, 
raw, 

beautiful 
moments 
that 
no 

camera can capture. And also, 
don’t forget to buy at least one 
cheesy tourist sweater.

Study abroad: A whole world away

MAYA MOKH

Assistant MiC Editor

This past summer, LSA senior 

Zainab Bhindarwala spent a 
month in Prague, Czech Republic 
taking a class on Nationalism, 
Minorities and Migrations in 
Eastern Europe through the 
program “CGIS: Cross-Cultural 
Psychology in Prague, Czech 
Republic.”
How did you hear about this 
study abroad program?

The CGIS newsletter.

What made you want to apply?

The title of the class drew me 

in. I’ve never been particularly 
interested 
in 
traveling 
to 

Europe, and I knew very little 
about the Czech Republic prior 
to this experience. I applied to 
this program hoping the class 
would help me with the thesis 
I’m writing this year.
What is your favorite memory 
from your experience?

One of my favorite memories 

from this trip is when a couple 
of us ended up having lunch 
with our professor. Getting to 
know her and learning about 
Czech culture outside of our 
classroom 
setting 
was 
so 

interesting. We saw a new part 
of the city and talked about the 
differences between Czech and 
American cultures. I loved that 
my professor never questioned 
that I was American. She asked 
all of us questions about the 
United 
States 
without 
any 

hesitation or assumption that 
I would know less than my 
white peers or that I would 
have a different experience than 
them. After spending 20 years 
convincing people in my own 
hometown that I was indeed an 
American just like them, it was 
refreshing not to have to prove 
it with every sentence and every 
action. I didn’t think someone 
assuming I was American and 
not questioning it would affect 
me that much, but it did.
Was there anything that you 
struggled with during your 
study abroad?

Ramadan started while I was 

in Prague. I knew Ramadan 
and my study abroad program 

would overlap when I applied 
to the program, and I honestly 
wasn’t too concerned — I knew 
I would be back home for most 
of the month, and I wouldn’t 
really be missing any major 
nights of prayer. It wasn’t until 
the first day of Ramadan came 
that I realized exactly how 
much I missed being around 
my family during this time. 
For the first time in my entire 
life, I didn’t hear and say the 
phrases “Ramadan Mubarak” 
to countless people. In fact, 
thousands of miles away, in 
Prague, nobody wished me at all. 
Of course, I called my parents, 
and we wished each other over 
the phone and I got texts from 
family members and some non-
Muslim friends wishing me a 
happy Ramadan, but it was so 
different from actually hugging 
someone, 
saying 
“Ramadan 

Mubarak,” and asking them to 
pray for you as you promised 
to do the same for them. Even 
though these things were just 
tradition and not actually part 
of religious prayers, the feeling 
of community is what I missed 
the most.
Any advice for prospective 
students 
interested 
in 

studying abroad?

Look at all the study abroad 

offerings — don’t skim over 
any program because you’re 
not interested in visiting that 
country. A lot of people choose 
their study abroad programs 
based off where they want to 
travel to. I did the opposite. I 
applied to this program because 
the class sounded interesting 
— even though it was nowhere 
close to the region I was actually 
interested in traveling to. Even 
though this decision could have 
gone horribly wrong, it ended 
up being such an incredible 
experience for me! In the 
short time I was in Prague, I 
learned so much about myself 
and a whole region of the world 
I never really paid attention to. 
Don’t limit yourself by sticking 
with what’s safe and somewhat 
familiar. Take the plunge and 
go somewhere unexpected — 
you might be surprised by what 
you find there.

A

s 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan 
football 
season comes to an end, 
students begin to worry about 
where to keep their school 
spirit — leaving behind boxes 
of maize and blue apparel and 
enthusiasm. In the wake of 
last weekend’s final football 
game of the regular season, 
mourning is permitted, but 
only until our next hockey 
game.
If you frequent the hockey 
games, you know the student 
section’s unique dance moves, 
unparalleled 
volume 
and 
timely cheers. The Michigan 
Daily 
spoke 
with 
John 
Bartman and “Tall Tom,” two 
of the rowdy juniors that lead 
cheers for the arena.
“Hockey is the best-kept 
secret at the University of 
Michigan,” Tall Tom said, as 
he stands a staggering 6 feet 9 
inches above the crowd.
His accomplice, Bartman, 
strategically sits at the other 
end of the front row, and 
plays cowbell as the infamous 
metronome for the stadium’s 
cheers.
When the puck drops, we 
stand shoulder to shoulder, 
happily 
chanting, 
“The 
Victors.” When Bartman and 
Tom see fit, we unanimously 
begin yelling at the other 
goalie, with criticisms such 
as “It’s all your fault,” “You 
suck” or “Ugly goalie.” Others 
tend to join in along the 
way, resulting in an echo of 
inventive 
insults. 
Further, 
Tall Tom writes his own novel 
cheers on a whiteboard.
“They’re 
very 
in 
the 
moment, they’re clever,” Tom 
said.
When 
Michigan 
Men’s 
Hockey 
played 
against 
the University of Vermont 
Catamounts last season, we 

came back to win 3-2 after 
fighting against a steady 2-1 
head start. Tom spent the days 
before the game studying up 
on Catamount facts. In light 
of 
the 
announcement 
that 
Vermont is finally opening 
their first Target, the sign 
read: “You may have lost a 2-1 
lead, but at least you’re getting 
a Target.”
Other 
slights 
include 
photoshopping the opposing 
team’s coach into demeaning 
photographs, making claims 
about the team’s local bars 
and taking their opponents’ 
pictures off of dating apps, 
calling 
the 
photos 
“cute.” 
In the moment, clever and 
insulting. That’s the Michigan 
school spirit.
Throughout the Nov. 9 game 
against Notre Dame, Tom’s 
sign asked the Yost staff to 
play songs in high demand 
among students.
“We know the people that 
run the scoreboard and the 
audio,” Bartman said. “At 
the end of the year, we talk 
about what we can do better, 
what they want us to improve 
on and what went well.” 
By working with Yost, the 
students are able to create 
an 
environment 
comprised 
of cowbells, loud voices and 
passion, and one that draws 
in fans of all ages.
There’s 
something 
about 
the band’s placement adjacent 
to the student section that 
amplifies the excitement of 
both parties. Since the director 
of the band stands towards the 
bleachers, he can conduct the 
official band members while 
keeping an eye on John and his 
cowbell. This maintains great 
communication between the 
fans and the music, according 
to Bartman.
“We can’t override them 

— we kind of play off each 
other,” he said, alluding to 
the collaborative rendition of 
the “SpongeBob SquarePants” 
theme song sung the night 
before.
The 
teamwork 
between 
the band and the students is 
arguably the most integral 
part of the game, harnessing 
the passion that distinguishes 
Michigan spirit from other 
schools.
What will happen when 
these two graduate in 2020?
“I think it’s understood that 
once we leave, someone will 
fill our void, because that’s 
what we did,” Tom said as he 
reminisced on his freshman 
year.
Bartman 
agreed, 
adding 
that 
his 
energy 
and 
enthusiasm is what ultimately 
recruited him to play the 
cowbell. Though the crew 
discusses 
passing 
down 
the torch as an “organic” 
process and rejects the idea 
of a hierarchy, they have their 
eye on a number of younger 
students to fill their void.
“It’s free-flowing,” Bartman 
claimed. 
“We 
consider 
ourselves the children of Yost. 
We’ve all kind of taken that 
role.”
Michigan 
spirit 
never 
dies, but instead, hibernates. 
John Bartman and Tall Tom 
proclaimed themselves as the 
team’s “mascots,” with no 
incentive except school spirit. 
The hockey games have the 
talent on the ice and passion 
in the stands, but seem to lack 
the numbers seen at the Big 
House for football games. The 
next home game is against 
Michigan State on Dec. 1 at 
7:00 p.m.

H

ow 
can 
we 
conceptualize 
what it means to be 
sustainable? To start, we can 
go by a definition: “pertaining 
to a system that maintains 
its own viability by using 
techniques and resources that 
allow for continual reuse.” We 
can really ingest the words in 
this statement, understanding 
that to be sustainable means to 
live for the future, but it’s truly 
bewildering to consider how 
we can be conscious of each 
moment in the present in order 
to allow our future to exist. The 
glorified crux of sustainability 
has been a very difficult reality 
to achieve — perhaps even an 
unrealistic effort at this point. 
But I believe it’s equally as 
monumental to ask ourselves 
how we can each improve 
our own lifestyles in order to 
arrive that much closer to what 
has been widely perceived as 
impossible to reach.
Adopting 
a 
sustainable 
lifestyle has likely been one of 
the most radical phenomena to 
be theorized over the past few 
decades. We have been driven 
to live a modernized life by 
abiding to the constructs that 
were formed with the birth of 
industrialization in the 18th 
century. For our entire lives, 
we have eaten and thrown 
away our meals, used and 
thrown away clothes that have 
been too worn out, bought new 
vehicles and gotten rid of them 
once they were replaceable 
or irreparable and wore our 
bodies out with a scattered 
lifestyle until death. What we 
have failed to realize today is 
that those constructs can be 
now changed in a less radical 
way when their alternatives 
are less stigmatized by money 
and by the popular clique 
that is our society. We can 
eat natural meals that avoid 
manufacturing and processing, 
use clothes with more durable 
and 
less 
lavish 
material, 
use vehicles that prioritize 
efficiency 
rather 
than 
convenience 
and 
maintain 
ourselves 
in 
coexistence 
with other organisms for an 
enduring life.
We haven’t realized this 
need to change various aspects 
of our lifestyle because we’ve 
been 
able 
to 
survive 
and 
seemingly 
thrive 
for 
this 
long 
without 
considering 

our future. Like any survival 
measures, our lifestyle is not 
meant for permanence. We 
only use temporary techniques 
to keep ourselves going until 
we are able to find some stable 
resolve. The problem is that we 
fail to consider the future as 
we survive, yet we have to now 
more than ever so that it even 
exists.
Our politicians have recently 
not demonstrated a sustainable 
mindset, as they merely rely 
on technology and engineered 
methods to solve the issues 
that call for radical change. 
For one, I want to defend that 
conducting shooter drills or 
arming 
public 
places 
with 
guards is not how we should 
approach 
reducing 
civilian 
deaths 
by 
gun 
violence. 
Promoting the use of portable 
air filters as a substitute to 
clean air when the areas in 
which we live become engulfed 
in 
smoke 
from 
towering 
wildfires is not how we should 
approach improving the overall 
air quality of our populated 
areas. We should be taking 
direct action at the cause of 
these issues, being proactive 
rather than reactive so that we 
can create an enduring way of 
life for ourselves.
Many will follow up this 
argument 
with 
skepticism 
towards the feasibility of a 
sustainable society, claiming 
that it’s impossible to plan 
and implement a sustainable 
lifestyle 
that 
works 
everywhere. But what I believe 
is more important than asking 
how we will conquer this 
massive ordeal is asking when 
we will take it upon ourselves 
to 
even 
try. 
People 
are 
discouraged by the fact that no 
one can say exactly how we can 
all adopt a more sustainable 
lifestyle for ourselves now, 
for humankind in the future, 
but there is no possibility of 
even inching closer to that 
world if we don’t make an 
effort to advance towards it 
through 
understanding 
and 
collaboration. While we remain 
unsure if the plans we propose 
will completely follow through 
despite 
our 
progressive 
intentions, it’s necessary that 
we sincerely begin this process 
to overcome the contest we face 
from a stagnant government 
and society.
The young people of this 

generation who have begun to 
display their concern haven’t 
completely figured out how 
to execute our intentions yet, 
but we have at the very least 
begun to demand the answers 
to the big questions that some 
of our key politicians are 
failing to address regarding 
the 
sustainability 
issue. 
As stated by young activist 
Jeremy Ornstein in a rally for 
the “Green New Deal” towards 
the likely next speaker of the 
House 
of 
Representatives, 
“Speaker Pelosi, Democratic 
leadership, 
we 
are 
asking 
you to grow up. When will 
you come up with a plan to 
stop the climate crisis and 
defend the homes of millions 
of would-be climate refugees? 
When will you embrace a 
Green New Deal? You know, 
please, Speaker Pelosi, come 
of age with us. But if you can’t, 
if you’re too scared to try, if 
you’re too corrupt or cowardly, 
then get out of the way.” 
The truth is that we can’t 
conceptualize what it means 
to be sustainable yet. We are 
merely at the beginning of 
a new era during which we 
will discover a multitude of 
techniques to adopt so that we 
can lead a lifestyle that will 
maintain humankind for ages 
to come. As of now, I urge you 
to contribute to the creation 
of the era of sustainability 
by 
educating 
yourself 
on 
the facts of climate change 
like 
various 
university 
professors have done with 
the Intergovernmental Panel 
on Climate Change climate 
report. 
Support 
policies 
that demonstrate a potential 
drastic enough to uproot our 
society’s current constructs 
like the Green New Deal, 
and demand that our leaders 
work to make sustainable 
lifestyles, such as veganism, 
more accessible to people 
of 
every 
background 
and 
economic 
disposition. 
By 
taking 
action 
against 
the 
status quo with a brute force 
strong enough to deconstruct 
it, an act as heroic as saving 
the future of our world will 
become 
that 
much 
more 
normalized and that much 
more possible.

N

ov. 
19 
is 
marked 
as 
International 
Men’s Day, devoted 
to 
the 
positive 
contributions 
of 
men 
to 
greater 
society as well as 
highlighting 
men’s 
well-being. 
It 
is 
a 
day 
that 
went 
unrealized 
and 
unmarked. Perhaps 
this 
makes 
sense 
to 
many. 
After 
all, why celebrate 
the 
advances 
and 
highlight the plights of a 
historically privileged group? 
Men as a demographic have 
not typically had to fight 
for rights on the basis of 
gender. On the whole, they 
have been less likely to be 
victims of domestic violence, 
sexual violence and human 
trafficking. Worldwide, men 
hold the majority of the wealth, 
both in money and in land. It 
seems as though society was 
created for the male gender to 
succeed, and thus the point of 
an international day for men 
should be moot. 
However, even in the 21st 
century, gender imbalances 
still 
prevail. 
These 
imbalances exist beyond those 
perpetuated against women, 
though these are the ones 
most 
apparent 
in 
society. 
While 
gender 
inequalities 
against women are egregious 
and 
apparent, 
those 
that 
impact men still exist. They 
are 
under-discussed 
and 
often 
overlooked, 
possibly 
because men are more often 
encouraged 
to 
hide 
their 
problems and conform to social 
standards. 
Nevertheless, 
men and boys still are held to 
similar standards and suffer 
under the same inequalities 
that influence women, often 
in much more discreet ways.
In 
its 
modern 
form, 
International Men’s Day began 
in 1999, initiated in Trinidad 
and 
Tobago 
by 
Jerome 
Teelucksingh. 
In 
contrast 
with March 8’s International 
Women’s Day, International 
Men’s 
Day 
passes 
rather 
quietly, without marches or 
media attention. This fact 
is largely representative of 
the gender issues that affect 
men. For example, in much of 
the Western world, there is 
immense pressure to perform 
all standards of masculinity. 
This 
largely 
includes 
providing for the family as 
the 
primary 
breadwinner. 
Marriages in which the female 
partner outearns her male 
counterpart are more likely 
to suffer from infidelity and 

end in divorce. Husbands who 
earn less than their wives 
tend to feel inadequate and 
emasculated, 
as 
though they have 
failed to live up to 
their potential.
Such 
feelings 
of inadequacy can 
contribute to men’s 
failing 
mental 
health. Nationwide, 
6 million men suffer 
from 
depression. 
However, 
this 
condition 
goes 
largely undiagnosed in men. 
This may be because men are 
less likely to present with the 
more widely known symptoms 
of hopelessness and sadness, 

and tend to demonstrate anger, 
fatigue and loss of interest in 
daily life activities. It also may 
be the result of a general male 
reluctance to seek help for 
their disorders, owing largely 
to a tendency to downplay 
symptoms or to comply to 
social norms of emotional 
strength and stability. This 
is a trend with disastrous 
results. Male suicides have 
been consistently rising since 
2000, with men being four 
times as likely to die by suicide 
than women.
Typically 
stigmatized 
social behaviors are often 
policed more harshly when 
they appear in men. Gay and 
bisexual men suffer harshly 
from homophobia. According 
to a 1999 study, gay men were 
more likely than lesbians to be 
deemed mentally ill by society, 
and child adoption by gay men 
was viewed less favorably 
than by that of gay women. 
While societal attitudes have 
certainly shifted over the past 
two decades, particularly with 
the legalization of same-sex 
marriage in 2015, instances 
of homophobia still abound. 
Men and boys are less likely to 
engage in platonic touch with 
friends, leaving them cut-off 
physically and emotionally.
This 
lack 
of 
friendly 
touching between men and 
boys contributes to deeper 
emotional issues. Touch can 
act as a means of reducing 

stress 
and 
boosting 
self-
esteem. Lack of touch affects 
parenthood. Fathers tend to 
be less involved parents than 
mothers. This mostly stems 
from 
the 
aforementioned 
economic 
pressures 
that 
lead 
many 
men 
out 
of 
the 
home 
and 
into 
high-
pressure, 
long-hour 
jobs. 
Furthermore, paid paternity 
leave in the United States is 
extraordinarily scarce. Even 
when it is available, men 
who take advantage of the 
opportunity 
are 
criticized. 
Take, for example, a 2014 
instance involving New York 
Mets second baseman Daniel 
Murphy. Murphy missed the 
opening game of the season for 
the birth of his first child. In 
the days following the birth, 
Murphy received a series of 
criticisms for using his three 
days of paternity leave. Sports 
radio WFAN hosts Boomer 
Esiason 
and 
Craig 
Carton 
suggested 
that 
Murphy 
and his wife should have 
scheduled a C-section prior 
to the season opener. This 
anecdote is demonstrative of 
the fact that men are often 
shamed for engaging in typical 
standards of parenting. The 
manner through which men 
are shamed for stereotypically 
feminine behaviors prevents 
men and boys from creating 
and maintaining meaningful 
relationships.
When the topic of gender 
issues 
is 
invoked, 
the 
injustices 
against 
women 
are 
often 
the 
only 
ones 
discussed. 
This 
is 
often 
rightfully so, as these abuses 
are particularly egregious. 
However, 
this 
fact 
does 
not mean that men’s issues 
deserve 
to 
be 
completely 
ignored. The gender-related 
inequalities 
that 
impact 
males, the immense societal 
pressure to provide for their 
families, the discouragement 
of discussing their emotions 
and the harsh policing of 
potentially feminine behavior 
have 
overwhelmingly 
negative impacts on the male 
psyche. With rising suicide 
rates and instances of male 
substance abuse, it is evident 
that something must be done 
to alleviate this crisis. True 
gender equality cannot be 
achieved until all relating 
issues 
are 
acknowledged 
and combatted. In the era of 
#MeToo and other feminist 
movements, it is important to 
remember that gender issues 
affect everybody.

WALT DISNEY PICTURES

Making a good sequel is an 

art that few movie franchises 
have mastered. The success 
of “The Incredibles” hinged 
on the fact that the original 
audience had grown up and 
would pay to see it simply 
for the nostalgic feeling it 

invoked. “Harry Potter” had 
a built-in sequel, though flops 
like “Percy Jackson and the 
Olympians” have shown that 
this 
doesn’t 
always 
mean 

immediate 
success. 
“Ralph 

Breaks 
the 
Internet,” 
the 

second movie in the “Wreck-
It Ralph” series, had neither 
nostalgia nor a pre-written 
plot on its side, but maybe 
that’s exactly what made it 
such an entertaining thing to 
watch.

The movie opens with a 

FaceTime call with its creators, 
already setting the tone for the 
kind of fourth-wall breaking, 
sub-tweeting 
moments 
to 

come. It moves on to Vanellope 
(Sarah Silverman, “A Million 
Ways to Die in the West”) 
voicing her concerns about 
wanting 
more 
excitement 

from life. It’s a cliché but 
relevant sentiment, especially 
in the Millennial generation, 
whose dry humor the movie 
tries to mimic. On the other 
hand, Ralph, voiced by John 
C. Reilly (“Step Brothers”), 
is 
a 
very 
one-dimensional 

character. Where Vanellope 
spends hours considering her 
place in the digital world, 
Ralph simply wonders when 
he’ll have his next root beer. 

It’s this simplicity though, that 
gets the whole movie going and 
what eventually helps Ralph 
break the internet. 

Physically 
depicting 
the 

internet, 
in 
itself, 
is 
an 

interesting 
concept. 
But 

“Ralph Breaks the Internet” 
doesn’t just leave it at lovable 
characters 
or 
creating 
a 

complex metropolis to show 
the online world. The internet 
that 
Vanellope 
and 
Ralph 

encounter is also a fierce 
reflection of the way our world 
works. Each person connected 
to the internet is represented 
by 
a 
small 
block-headed 

person, oblivious to everyone 
and everything around them, 
just like in the real world. Even 
within Ralph and Vanellope, 
we see generational differences 
in the way people perceive the 
internet — Vanellope’s intricate 
understanding mirroring that 
of the young people who grew 
up with it and Ralph lumbering 
around the online world with 
only a vague concept of what 
the internet is. The movie 
uses Ralph and his innocence 
to explore the savage nature 
of an ever-changing public 
opinion, especially regarding 
those that gain quick internet 
fame. One scene shows Ralph 
standing among and staring at 
a never-ending set of columns 
filled with internet comments, 
a jarring portrayal of the way 
people can become lost in the 
negativity of internet trolls.

Where 
“Ralph 
Breaks 

the 
Internet” 
exploits 
the 

downfalls of our society, it 
also works to fill the void 
of strong female characters 
missing in film and Disney 
movies especially. Vanellope 
is a curious and outgoing 
character; 
contrasted 

with 
Ralph’s 
unassuming, 

blubbering 
demeanor, 
she 

comes 
across 
as 
an 
even 

stronger person. As the film 
so blatantly points out in the 
Disney 
princess 
dressing 

room, this kind of dynamic is 
uncharacteristic of cartoons 

and is a refreshing change 
to the typical Disney trope. 
What’s 
more, 
the 
major 

supporting 
characters 
are 

women in leadership roles — 
Shank (Gal Gadot, “Wonder 
Woman”) is a firm gang leader 
and Yaz is “head algorithm,” 
making decisions that affect 
the fate of the internet. Her 
role is reminiscent of Meryl 
Streep’s 
iconic 
Miranda 

Priestley in “The Devil Wears 
Prada.” The movie goes one 
step further and not only 
breaks stereotypes with its 
own characters but pushes the 
Disney princesses into a space 
that’s less about their damsel 
in distress status.

This 
being 
said, 
“Ralph 

Breaks the Internet” doesn’t 
set itself up for longevity; the 
jokes rely heavily on a detailed 
understanding 
of 
current 

internet culture, the thing 
that matters most is that Ralph 
and Vanellope end up with the 
kind of friendship we all want 
in our lives. Understanding 
their differences is an integral 
message of “Ralph Breaks the 
Internet” and brings the movie 
home.

FILM REVIEW

The internet 

that Vanellope 

and Ralph 

encounter is also 

a fierce reflection 

of the way our 

world works

“I do solemnly swear that 

I will faithfully execute the 
Office of President of the 

United States, and will to the 
best of my ability, preserve, 

protect 
and 
defend 
the 

Constitution of the United 
States.”

These 
are 
the 
words 

spoken by every US president 
before they take office. It is 
an oath that has been heard 
by hundreds of millions of 
people, echoed by 44 men. It 
is a promise to the people of 
the United States that they 
will work in their elected 
position 
with 
dignity 
and 

integrity, a promise to uphold 
the values and laws laid out 
in the nation’s constitution. 
In “Enemies: The President, 
Justice, and the FBI,” a new 
four-part documentary from 
directors 
Jed 
Rothstein 

(“Made in America”) and Alex 
Gibney (“The Clinton Affair”), 
it is a promise that is often 
broken.

“Enemies” 
follows 
four 

of the biggest presidential 

controversies of the past 50 
years. It starts with Nixon’s

Timely ‘Enemies’ explores 
presidential controversies

TV REVIEW

Watergate 
scandal, 
then 

progresses 
into 
the 
Iran-

Contra Deal and the Clinton 
trials 
before 
ending 
on 

Trump’s Mueller probe and 
the accusations of election 
interference 
from 
Russia. 

Trump is only named as the 
subject of a single episode, but 
his presence is obvious and 
available in each of the series’s 
episodes. A newscast recapping 
the 
beginning 
of 
Russian 

meddling at the Democratic 
National 
Convention 
cuts 

to a ’70s anchor reporting 
the DNC at Watergate had 
been bugged. Clips of Trump 
denying Russian collusion fade 
to Reagan denying a hostages-
for-arms 
deal. 
Trump 

complaining about a “witch 
hunt” turns into Clinton being 
questioned 
about 
Monica 

Lewinsky. There is no doubt as 
to why a series on presidential 
scandals is being released in 
2018.

Based 
on 
the 
novel 

“Enemies: A History of the 
FBI” by Tim Weiner, a former 
correspondent to The New 
York Times, “Enemies” is not 
trying to offer analysis or an 
opportunity for viewers to 
think deeper. The series is 
essentially a history lesson 
from a cool, young professor. It 
tells viewers the information 
they already know but this 
time accompanied by effective 

graphics 
and 
compelling 

interviews.

This is not to say the show 

is not worth your time. As 
headlines 
become 
more 

shocking by the day, “Enemies” 

reminds us that not all that 
much has changed. There was 
a time people never thought 
the president would think of 
himself above the law, until he 
did. A time they didn’t think a 
beloved leader would collude 
with international enemies, 
until he did. A time no one 
thought an offensive man with 
no political experience and 
an insatiable ego would be 
elected, until he was.

“Enemies” gives viewers the 

tools necessary to challenge 
the outdated sentiment that a 
president must be trusted and 
respected. There is no reason 
to trust a man that seems like 
he has something to hide. 
There is no reason to respect 
a man that breaks his word 
to the people that gave him 
his job. We are taught since 
elementary school that the 
president is the most highly 
regarded figure in our society, 
the leader of the free world. 
That one day, we too can be 
president. 
“Enemies” 
asks: 

Why would we want to be? The 
past five decades has seen an 
incredible amount of corrupt 
leadership, and that is just 
those who got caught. Perhaps 
it’s time to stop telling kids that 
they can be congressmen or 
senators or even the president, 
and instead encourage them 
to be the ones that hold those 
people accountable.

I am going to start off 

by saying that this review 
will be written in a rather 
unconventional way. I usually 
try to remove myself from the 
performance and the artist 
when critiquing, try to paint a 
picture of the audience and the 
atmosphere of the place — I try 
to connect the performance to 
something that everyone can 
relate to. I saw the incredible 
Audra McDonald perform on 
the eve of my 19th birthday and 
the performance easily broke 
through my journalistic shell, 
completely penetrating into my 
body and touching my heart in a 
way that no other performance 
has, so it would be unfair for 
me to even try and write an 
objective review. 

As 
I 
walked 
into 
Hill 

Auditorium to see the six-
time 
Tony 
Award 
winning 

singer and actress, I was not 
prepared to be as affected by 
the performance as I was. For 
one, the set was comprised of 
a single stool and her band. 
It was peculiar seeing such a 
simple and bare-minimum set 
in such a large, elaborate space. 
Mark Vanderpoel took the bass 
tenderly in his hands, Gene 
Lewinsat at the drums and 
Andy Einhorn — an incredible 
and 
well-established 
music 

director — asserted himself at 
the piano, all of them dressed in 
fine evening wear. 

Hill Auditorium was packed, 

with no empty seats in sight. 
It 
seemed 
impossible 
that 

one person could fill such a 
massive space with her voice 
and presence. Tension rose in 
the eager audience waiting for 
the famed McDonald to come 
out, and when she did, her 
presence automatically lit the 
stage, and the audience came to 

life. Applause roared from the 
audience, before she even got 
a chance to sing a song or tell a 
story. 

McDonald’s voice in every 

song was incredible; it was 
almost maddening. Her sweet 
vibrato echoed through Hill 
Auditorium with such power. 
She made every single piece 
her own, putting her own spin 
on it. Pieces that I have heard 
a great deal, like “Vanilla Ice 
Cream” from “She Loves Me,” 
or “I Could’ve Danced all 
Night” from “My Fair Lady” 
— extremely popular songs 
found in the arsenals of many 
sopranos — were captured in 
a different and intriguing way. 
Even though I am very familiar 
with the plots surrounding 
most of the songs, McDonald 
sung them in a way where it felt 
as if I was listening to them for 
the first time. Through placing 
emphasis on different lyrics 
than usual and putting a new 
spin on the vocal tone used 
to sing the piece, I took away 
something new from the songs 
in her set. 

Her 
set 
included 
the 

borderline 
classical 
song, 

“Summertime” 
from 
“Porgy 

and Bess,” which she sang 
magnificently 
without 
a 

microphone, 
in 
traditional 

classical style. She sang two 
of my personal favorites from 
her repertoire, “Stars and the 
Moon” from “Songs for a New 
World” and “I Won’t Mind” 
from “The Other Franklin.” 
These songs are difficult to 
sing (I know from personal 
experience) because they are 
wordy and vocally challenging 
at 
the 
same 
time. 
These 

challenges 
seemed 
to 
have 

not phased McDonald, as she 
sang both songs as if they were 
an extension of her normal 
speaking voice. 

What was most impressive 

was 
McDonald’s 
incredible 

ability to tell stories. This is 
what 
set 
her 
performance 

apart from any another that I 
have seen. McDonald shared 
anecdotes 
of 
her 
life 
and 

anecdotes of memories she 
shared with the lives of others. 
She uses the power of her voice 
and her talent for storytelling 
through words and songs to 
touch the hearts of audiences 
everywhere, 
whether 
it 
be 

telling her own stories or telling 
the stories of others. What had 
really caused me to enter a state 
of raw emotion is how much of 
myself I saw in her. It was almost 
like watching the future that I 
want for myself play out in front 
of my eyes. Even more nerve-
wracking, she took me through 
this journey, reminiscing and 
reflecting on all the things I 
have accomplished throughout 
my life in one of the most 
effective 
mediums: 
song. 

While McDonald’s storytelling 
was 
incredible, 
what 
truly 

completed the story was the use 
of song. 

Yet, I was haunted by the 

fact 
that 
every 
story 
that 

McDonald told hit so close to 
home. It became impossible 
for me to remain objective and 
composed. There were so many 
parallels between her life and 
mine that it felt unnerving at 
times to listen to them. 

I grew up in New York 

City, and went to Fiorello H. 
LaGuardia 
High 
School 
of 

Music & Art and Performing 
Arts, where I studied vocal 
music. I knew too well the 
stories that McDonald told 
about being in a performing arts 
school. There were moments 
that we shared, such as a quirky 
story about her singing an age-
inappropriate jazz song for 
a competition when she was 
14-years-old, which was told 
in the perspective of a sexually 
frustrated housewife. 

It was fitting, with it being

Me, myself and the wonder of Audra McDonald

COMMUNITY CULTURE SPOTLIGHT

my 19th birthday, as I looked 
back on my time when I first 
started at a performing arts 
high school, and how I would 
just sing for fun. I sang because 
that is what I loved to do, and 
I did not care about whether a 
song was age appropriate or if 
anyone approved of my venture 
into the arts because it’s what 
I loved and knew. As I grew 
older, it seemed as if more and 
more obstacles got in the way 
of this dream. I grew up on 
Broadway, whether it was going 
to the theater and watching 
shows or watching YouTube 
videos 
of 
Broadway 
stars, 

including Audra McDonald. I 
remember fully believing that 
Broadway was where I was 
headed and destined for. As I 
grew more and continued on 
my performing career in high 
school to now, I started to lose 
sight of that dream as more 
and more obstacles seemed to 
get in my way. Whether it was 
being a woman of color having 
to work harder than my white 
counterparts for a lead in a 
show, it occasionally felt like 
my performance was ever good 
enough. 

McDonald 
reminded 
me, 

as a young performer, of why 
I started singing in the first 
place. As I sat and watched her 
perform, 
seemingly 
without 

inhibitions, it got me thinking 
as to where along the way I lost 
my sentiment and will to sing. 
It reminded me that I sing for 
myself and that people want to 
hear others sing. Of course, it 
would be extremely difficult — 
almost impossible, in my mind, 
to reach the level of fluency 
that McDonald has reached in 
her career through hard work 
and a gifted voice, but seeing 
McDonald as a human with 
real stories to tell and a real, 
raw voice was enough to get me 
motivated to try and reach for 
that level.

The most intriguing thing is 

that during this performance, 
it felt as if I was having this 
personal 
connection 
and 

conversation with her and so 
did others around me. I had 
never seen so many people 
get teary-eyed at a rendition 
of 
“Somewhere 
Over 
the 

Rainbow.” Hill Auditorium did 
not seem so big anymore. It was 
as if I was back in kindergarten 

again, arranged in a circle and 
listening to stories told by my 
teacher attentively, sitting at 
the edge of my seat. It was as if I 
was sitting with my mother, an 
English teacher, and listening 
to her tell me stories in both 
song and book. I felt at home 
and nostalgic. 

What I took away from Audra 

McDonald’s performance was 
a message of hope and love. 
She had used her voice to 
empower the audience, and she 
expressed her message of hope 
and love for the generations 
to come, saying that as young 
performers and young people 
in general, she has faith in us 
to fix what has been botched by 
previous generations. She urged 
those in power and in a higher 
position to nurture the coming 
generations, singing the fitting 
song “Children Will Listen” 
from “Into the Woods.” There 
was message of love to be found 
for all audience members. The 
concert was more than just a 
journey through the American 
Songbook, it was a beautiful 
performance that has taught 
me so much about who I am and 
who I want to become.

Loudly. Then

Michigan’s

didn’t have 
much to say about what hap-
pened at Ohio Stadium on Sat-
urday afternoon. Neither did 
his coach, nor his other team-

reporters after the Wolverines’ 
62-39 dismantling at the hands 
of Ohio State.
I don’t blame them. Truth 
be told, there isn’t much to say 
about this rivalry anymore, 
other than what has been said 
for the past few years.
Michigan has not beaten the 
Buckeyes in seven years, not 
since Ohio State hired Urban 
Meyer. The Wolverines have 
won once in the past 15 years, 
which means that if you are 
a freshman in high school 
like my sister, you have seen 
exactly one (1) win. And it was 
against a terrible Ohio State 
team led by an interim coach.

childhood, the years when you 
start to retain lasting memo-
ries, who have never seen 
Michigan beat the Buckeyes. 
Their formative memories 
of this rivalry will be of a 
botched two-point conversion 
in 2013. A disputed spot after a 
fourth-down play in 2016.
And what happened Satur-
day, when Ohio State quarter-
back Dwayne Haskins played 
pitch-and-catch with his team-
mates and Buckeye freshman 
receiver Chris Olave etched his 
name into history by catching 

two touchdowns and blocking 
a punt that was returned for a 
score.
Ohio State 
gets Herculean 
efforts from 
players like 
Haskins and 
Olave seemingly 
every year. And 
almost every 
time, the Wol-
verines are left 
with the same 
feeling — what 
Patterson put 
into words as “a pretty sour 
taste.”
Understandably, Patterson 
was muted and mostly kept his 
answers short.
But I want to discuss one of 
his longer responses.
Patterson was asked wheth-

er he would characterize this 
season as a success.
“I do,” he said. “We have 
high expecta-
tions and high 
hopes here at 
Michigan, and 
that’s displayed 
every day in 
work at prac-
tice. So any time 
we don’t reach 
our ultimate 
goal, that’s obvi-
ously a little bit 
of a letdown to 
most of us.
“But a 10-win season, you 
know, we played a lot of good 
teams, played in the Big Ten. 
And, I don’t know, I think this 
is a successful season. Still 
have a bowl game to go com-
pete for.”

That’s different from what 
Harbaugh said 32 years ago 
when he guaranteed a Michi-
gan win over 
Ohio State.
“The last 10 
games we played 
mean nothing to 
us right now. It’s 
down to a one-
game season,” 
Harbaugh said 
in 1986. “Ohio 
State is our sea-
son. If we win 
this game, then 
it’s a successful season.”
As I drove back from Colum-
bus last night, I thought about 
how to square those two state-
ments. They seem to conflict 
with each other.
I think now that I would 
agree with Patterson’s asser-

tion.
For the program in its cur-
rent state, this was a success-
ful season. 
Harbaugh and 
the Wolverines 
deserve credit 
for turning 
around the ship 
in one short 
year after fin-
ishing 8-5 last 
season. Har-
baugh parted 
ways with one 
of his longest-
tenured assistants. He brought 
a few fresh voices onto his 
staff. Michigan is recruiting 
much better than it was last 
year, which was very much 
needed. It’s playing much bet-
ter, too.
The Wolverines went from 

fourth in the Big Ten East to 
winning a share of the divi-
sion title by beating Wiscon-
sin, Michigan State and Penn 
State. The “Revenge Tour” 
injected life into the program. 
Now Michigan will have a 
chance to win 11 games, which 
it has done just twice this cen-
tury.
In all of those aspects, the 
season was a success, like Pat-
terson said.
Because things have 
changed since Harbaugh made 
his famous guarantee. This 
isn’t the same Michigan. The 
Wolverines don’t trade Big 
Ten titles with Ohio State 
anymore. They hardly go to 
the Rose Bowl, which is why 
a trip this year — even though 
it isn’t a playoff game — would 
still mean something to this 
program.
Losing to Ohio State with 
a Big Ten championship and 
playoff bid on the line is a bit-
ter pill to swallow.
That is the dark cloud that 
will be cast over this season. 
Saturday’s loss showed just 
far apart these two programs 
are, when many (including me) 
thought Harbaugh and Michi-
gan would close the gap this 
year.
But it wasn’t too long ago 
that this program finished 5-7 
and made its second coaching 
change in four years. Har-
baugh has revived Michigan. 
Since then, Harbaugh has led 
the Wolverines to three dou-
ble-digit seasons in four years, 
the first to do it since Fielding 
Yost. That’s why it would be 
hard to deem this season as a 
failure.
The bars have shifted lower. 
And that’s where they’ll 
remain until the Wolverines 
win the only game that used to 
matter.

Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh and the Wolverines left Columbus, Ohio on Saturday with a 62-39 loss to Ohio State and a 10-2 record headed into the postseason. 

The more things change
C

OLUMBUS — It 
felt shockingly 
improbable, yet so 
oddly familiar.
Like everything that 
happened 
— from the 
opening 
touchdown 
drive to 
the blocked 
punt to the 
four ensuing 
touchdowns, 
and all 
the gory 
details in 
the middle 
— was so wholly predictable. 
Like everyone with two eyes 
and a cursory knowledge of 
recent college football history 
should have known better. 
Especially those who’d lived 
it, breathed it and suffered 
the consequences.
Four hours later, after a 
staining 62-39 defeat, it sure 
seems like everyone was 
duped anyway.
“It didn’t go good, didn’t 
end up good,” said Michigan 
coach Jim Harbaugh “We 
take responsibility for it.”
This team was different; 
at least, the lead up to 
Saturday’s game was billed 
as such. Michigan had the 
top-ranked defense in the 
country, weapons galore 
on offense and finally a 
quarterback. It had paraded 
a “Revenge Tour” for the 
wrongs done in 2017 — and 
was 3/4th the way through 
those opponents. Tepid as 
it may have been, junior 
running back Karan Higdon 
guaranteed a win. There was 
swagger.
Ohio State was different, 
too. Finally, oh finally, 
vulnerable. It had lost by 
29 points to Purdue just 
weeks prior. It had a porous 
defense, ripe for exploiting. 
Conventional wisdom ahead 
of the matchup was that 
the home field was the only 
advantage the Buckeyes held.
Michigan went into The 
Game between a three- and 

five-point favorite.
“We all had mindsets to go 
to the Big Ten Championship. 
We all had mindsets of 
beating Ohio State,” said 
senior safety Tyree Kinnel. 
“And I felt like we start 
having that mindset after 
the Wisconsin game. After 
we beat them, beat Michigan 
State, beat Penn State, we 
were high on confidence.
“Maybe we were a little bit 
too ahead of ourselves.”
In the process, the 
Wolverines lost their season. 
There will be no trip to 
Indianapolis next weekend, 
nor a destination in the 
College Football Playoff. 
Just 10 hollow wins, one 
giant mental block and 
interminable questions.
The Buckeyes hung 62 
points on that aforementioned 
top-ranked defense Saturday 
— topping the prior Michigan 
record of 56 points allowed to 
Cornell in 1889. 
“I mean, I guess you could 
say shocked a little bit,” 
Kinnel said. “My mindset, our 
mindset as a defense coming 
into this game was to play 
like we’ve been playing all 
year. We feel like we had high 
confidence, we felt like we 
had a good shot at dominating 
this game.
“We made adjustments at 
halftime, we addressed the 
issues we had in the first 
half, and they came out and 
beat us with something else 
in the second half,” he added. 
“…They completely beat us 
today.”
The Wolverines offense 
didn’t fare much better, 
tallying just 235 yards of 
offense and 18 points before 
three late-game drives made 
the scoreline appear closer 
than the game really was.
In the end, this was Ohio 
State and this was Michigan, 
both holding true to form of 
the previous two decades. In 
the end, nothing was truly 
different.
It almost seems beyond 
the scope of the present to 

point fingers in a team-wide 
drubbing of this magnitude. 
Which is why it’s easy and 
fair to turn point them 
straight at the coaching 
staff. Harbaugh, for his part, 
accepted blame.
Even that seems to bely 
what’s institutionally 
baked into the program. 
This is 14 of 15 years now. 
It’s 19 years without a win 
in Columbus; players are 
coming into the program 
who haven’t been alive 
that long. There’s a mental 
stranglehold that extends 
beyond talent or execution 
or individual gameplans. 
This is a purgatory Michigan 
cannot escape until it finally 
clears the last hurdle. After 
Saturday, that mental hurdle 
seems as high as ever.
Ohio State quarterback 
Dwayne Haskins summed it 
up best.
“I mean, we didn’t need 
the underdog score point. 
We didn’t need the revenge 
tour. We didn’t need the 
guaranteed win. We know 
what this game means to our 
school, to our teammates and 
to our coaches.”
As the Michigan offense 
waved the proverbial white 
flag, milking the clock down 
by 23 in the fourth quarter, 

the mind wandered to 
broader implications. There 
will be a cushy bowl game in 
Pasadena or New Orleans or 
some destination getaway. 
Players and coaches will talk 
about turning the page. There 
will be hand-wringing over 
what consistutes a successful 
season. It will all mean 
nothing. It’s almost as though 
today was never about just 
one game.
This is a program that 
came into Ohio Stadium 
seemingly on the precipice of 
a breakthrough. It leaves four 
hours later as far from that 
as ever.
“We’ll come back motivated 
to make darn sure it doesn’t 
happen again,” Harbaugh said 
of his mindset. 
And he will, for the next 
12 months, convince himself 
that next year is the one. So 
will some fans. Then next 
November will come and the 
Wolverines will be shoved 
back into reality by the 
“rival” that still controls it 
all.
In the end, maybe it’s 
just that simple. Same old 
Michigan.

Offensive gameplan leaves lingering questions

Standing at the podium, hat 
fixed, mood stoic, there wasn’t 
much Michigan coach Jim 
Harbaugh could say.
A reporter asked broadly 
about his offensive gameplan. 
Harbaugh’s 
response 
was 
terse.
“Wanted to run our best 
plays,” he said. “Throwing, 
moving the ball, outside zone, 
inside power. We had basically 
everything — drop back, zone 
read. Roll-outs, boots, that was 
our plan.”
After 
the 
thorough 
undressing that was Saturday’s 
62-39 
loss 
to 
Ohio 
State, 
nothing was left unworthy 
of 
scrutiny. 
The 
offensive 
gameplan — and the execution 
that 
ensued 
— 
certainly 
warranted closer examination. 
And upon that examination, 
it was a gameplan devoid of 
necessary creativity.
On 
its 
face, 
Michigan’s 
offensive output was far from 
the main issue. The Wolverines 
posted 401 total yards and 39 
points. Before the game, most 
would 
have 
thought 
those 
numbers would have sufficed 
for a win — even a comfortable 
one. 
But that fails to encapsulate 
the lack of ambition, and clear 
contrast in styles, throughout 
the game — especially at the 
outset. 
Harbaugh isn’t wrong; there 
was plenty sprinkled into the 
offense throughout the game. 
The emphasis was clear: He 
hoped the running game would 
take control, work the clock 
and tire Ohio State’s defense. 
Off that, junior quarterback 
Shea Patterson could make 
plays out of zone-read and 
play-action. It’s what they’d 
done all year, so why should 
Saturday have been different?
And for a while, it was 
working to an extent. Early in 
the second quarter, Michigan 

had run 25 plays to Ohio State’s 
six, tallied 98 total yards to 
the Buckeyes’ 17 and held 
possession of the ball for 12:35 
to Ohio State’s 1:55. 
Yet 
at 
that 
point 
the 
Buckeyes still led the game, 
7-6.
Ohio State opened up a 21-6 
lead in the blink of an eye, and 
that’s when the 
challenge 
was 
truly pressed on 
the Wolverines’ 
offense. 
Had 
they 
been 
playing with a 
lead, 
perhaps 
this game would 
have played out 
differently. 
For 
a pro-style, run-
first 
offense, 
playing with the 
lead is always the plan until it 
can’t be.
But when that plan was 
thrown 
out 
the 
window, 
Harbaugh 
and 
his 
offense 
had no response. There were 
no big plays. The read-option 
that had become a staple 
of the offense was few and 
far between. There was no 
challenging a susceptible Ohio 

State 
secondary 
Maryland 
torched for 51 points last week.
Michigan threw the ball 10 
or more yards past the line of 
scrimmage just four times in 
the first half, when the game 
was within striking distance. 
Including 
penalties, 
those 
plays averaged 13.5 yards. The 
other 40 plays averaged 4.5 
yards per play.
It 
seemed 
like a coaching 
staff 
intent 
on bashing its 
head 
against 
a 
wall. 
And 
all the while, 
the Buckeyes’ 
offense 
was 
running circles 
around 
the 
Wolverines’ 
defense 
by 
spreading their offense out, 
getting their weapons in space 
and letting their All-Big Ten 
quarterback deliver.
Ohio State ended the game 
with six touchdown drives 
that lasted fewer than three 
minutes. 
The 
Wolverines 
offense ran 16:12 off the clock 
in their first six possessions 
and had just six points to 

show for it. That contrast was 
evident all day.
There is the larger question 
now, which many seem eager 
to litigate, of Jim Harbaugh’s 
pro-style offense. To be fair, 
that criticism was muted no 
less than a week ago.
It 
would 
be 
wrong 
to 
insinuate this team ran the 
same offense it has for the last 
three years under Harbaugh. 
To a large extent, Harbaugh 
altered this offense quite a 
bit with Patterson in tow — 
and it was evident in several 
dominant wins. Saturday, for 
example, Michigan ran 70 of 
its 85 plays from the shotgun 
or 
pistol 
formations. 
That 
would be unheard of in the last 
three seasons.
In the end, Harbaugh was 
right. Michigan ran its “best 
plays.” 
It 
included 
those 
concepts 
he 
mentioned 
in 
the 
press 
conference. 
The 
Wolverines 
won’t 
suddenly 
become a spead team as long as 
Harbaugh is the coach. Tweaks 
are one thing. Overhaul isn’t 
coming.
On Saturday against Ohio 
State, those “best plays” were 
not enough. And now, let the 

Shifting expectations
S

ix games into the season, the 
Michigan men’s basketball 
team is 
6-0. The clos-
est of those 
were 19-point 
wins against 
Norfolk 
State, Holy 
Cross and 
Providence. 
Its defense 
is the best in 
the country, 
per KenPom’s 
adjusted defensive efficiency. It 
was ranked ninth in last week’s 
AP poll — ahead of any other Big 
Ten team — and will likely move 
up on Monday. And if you listen 
to Michigan coach John Beilein, 
you’d think he was unaware of any 
of that.
“I don’t think we’re this 
juggernaut,” Beilein said, after the 
Wolverines dispatched Tennessee-
Chattanooga, 83-55, on Friday 
afternoon. “I think we’re OK. ... We 
don’t have that type of experience 
yet to just say, ‘OK, watch out. Here 
comes Michigan.’ ”
Beilein’s job, of course, requires 
him to say things like that. And it’s 
true that six games in November 
— most of them against terrible 
competition — don’t make a season.
But not all of those wins are 
hollow. Crushing Villanova, by 
27, at Villanova — that means 
something. So does dispatching 
Providence, a likely tournament 
team, by 19 points.
“I think we certainly got 
some teams that are rebuilding,” 
Beilein said. “Villanova, George 
Washington and Providence. They 
all lost some pretty key players — 
as we did.”
A month ago, it looked like this 
would be a rebuilding year for the 
Wolverines — or at least what a 
program that just made a national 
title game could classify as such. 
Nobody knew where the shooting 
would come from, how quickly 
the freshmen could be integrated, 
whether sophomores Isaiah Livers 
or Eli Brooks could take the next 

step.
The shooting hasn’t been great, 
but the defense is so good that it 
hasn’t mattered. Only one of five 
freshmen has played significant 
minutes, but that freshman, Ignas 
Brazdeikis, is averaging 15.7 points 
per game, and looks like a star. 
Playing Livers, a natural forward, 
at the ‘5’ has unlocked a new level 
for the Wolverines on both sides 
of the ball; Brooks has been more 
than serviceable coming off the 
bench.
North Carolina and Purdue, two 
teams in KenPom’s top-15, loom 
next week, and the Wolverines 
can reasonably expect to win both 
games.
None of those questions from 
the start of the season have been 
fully answered — they can’t be in 
six games. But if things continue 
this way, Michigan won’t just 
compete in the Big Ten, but sustain 
a spot in the national conversation.
The Wolverines, already, 
have recalibrated expectations, 
changing the conversation around 
the team. Beating the Tar Heels 
— who smacked them in Chapel 
Hill around this time last season 
— would be yet another signal of a 
shifting ceiling.
“I feel like we’re alright,” said 
sophomore guard Jordan Poole. 
“We’re getting the shots that we 
practice. We can get better shots. 
But we also are turning down some 
shots. We’re not being aggressive 
in some areas. It’s definitely just 
coming for our defense, we’re 
getting a lot of stops. We should be 
running hard in transition. It’s just 
a lot of little things that we can still 
work on.”
Like Beilein, Poole is supposed 
to talk about improving when 
faced with questions about how 
good Michigan is. And like Beilein, 
there’s a kernel of truth in there. 
The Wolverines can get better.
That’s what makes the first six 
games so scary.

Wolverines fall to Wisconsin in shootout

It only takes one play to 
change a game.
Saturday night, the No. 14 
Michigan hockey team (6-5-1 
overall, 2-2-1 Big Ten) had two 
of them in regulation before it 
tied with Wisconsin (5-7-1, 1-3-
1), 2-2, in double overtime and 
then fell in the shootout.
Late in the third period, facing 
a 
one-goal 
deficit, 
redshirt 
sophomore 
forward 
Luke 
Morgan received a pass from 
junior defenseman Luke Martin 
as he was crossing the offensive 
blue line, all alone in front of 
goaltender Daniel Lebedeff.
A little bit of stickwork and a 
quick shot later, and Morgan had 
notched his first goal of the year 
and tied the game at two.
“Good to see (Morgan) get off 
the mark there,” said Michigan 
coach Mel Pearson. “It’s just 
gonna help him and give him 
some confidence. … We’re gonna 
need that secondary scoring 
going forward. We’re getting 
guys to contribute now and 
we’re doing a good job. Good for 
(Morgan). That was a big goal.”
But despite Morgan’s heroics, 
eight minutes later, the game 
was still tied, and the Wolverines 
headed to their third straight 
overtime game.
Michigan sustained pressure 
on 
Lebedeff 
through 
most 
of the first overtime period 
but couldn’t knock the puck 
through. With 1:20 left in the 
stanza, senior defenseman Nick 
Boka was whistled for hooking. 
The penalty kill held strong, 
sending the game to double 
overtime and 3-on-3 action for 
the second night in a row.
Wisconsin 
had 
an 
extra 
skater to begin the second 
overtime period, but Michigan 
neutralized the man advantage. 
The five minutes of 3-on-3 came 
and went, and the game was still 
tied.
“You want to win them in 
regulation, but we’ll take it any 
way we can if we have to drag it 
to overtime,” Morgan said. “We 
have to come out with the win 
some way. It’s best in regulation, 

you don’t have to worry about 
it, it’s not as nerve wrecking at 
times, but we’ll take it any way 
we can.”
But on Saturday, the next step 
was a shootout for the extra Big 
Ten point — not a victory for 
either side. The game went down 
as a tie after the first overtime, 
meaning each team earned one 
point for conference standings. 
The shootout winner earned the 
second point.
Junior 
forward 
Will 
Lockwood went first in the 
shootout and his effort was 
just barely saved by Lebedeff. 
Next, Wisconsin forward Wyatt 
Kalynuk shot wide of the net.
Following 
Kalynuk, 
sophomore defenseman Quinn 
Hughes fired a shot that went 
well wide.
As the second shooter in the 
second round, forward Max 
Zimmer beat junior goaltender 
Hayden Lavigne five-hole, and 
the Badgers streamed onto the 
ice to celebrate.
Before it got to the shootout, 
or even scored a goal, Michigan 
was down by two and struggling 
to find a rhythm.
For the first time all season, 

Lavigne earned the starting 
nod on back-to-back nights. He 
came up with some big saves in 
the first five minutes, effectively 
neutralizing 
the 
constant 
pressure from the Badgers. But 
4:21 into the first period, Hughes 
was called for slashing and the 
Wolverines were sent to the 
penalty kill for the first time in 
the game.
Less than a minute later, with 
Wisconsin pressuring Lavigne in 
the crease, Boka lost his footing 
and allowed his assignment — 
defenseman K’Andre Miller — to 
slip past him and tuck the puck 
past the outstretched glove of 
Lavigne. He got part of his glove 
on the puck, but it wasn’t enough 
to save the goal.
In the second period, Lavigne 
fell victim to another defensive 
breakdown. When Michigan’s 
defenders 
slipped 
out 
of 
position, forward Jack Gorniak 
was able to get his stick on the 
puck and flip it up over Lavigne’s 
shoulder.
Suddenly, 
the 
Wolverines 
trailed, 2-0. The game appeared 
to be slipping out of reach.
Shortly afterwards, Hughes 
entered the offensive zone with 

the puck and slipped it across 
the ice to sophomore forward 
Josh Norris. Norris found fellow 
sophomore forward Jack Becker 
coming down through the slot 
and put the puck right on his 
stick.
Becker tapped the puck past 
Lebedeff and cut the Wolverines’ 
deficit to 2-1.
But the two goals would prove 
to be not enough, after all the 
extra periods and the shootout. 
Michigan’s power play, which 
entered the weekend ranked 
seventh in the nation, failed to 
score on any of its seven chances. 
The Wolverines recorded just 
12 shots across those seven 
opportunities.
“We’ve been riding our power 
play,” Pearson said. “It’s been 
really good for us lately. It’s 
been winning us a lot of games. 
Tonight, and this weekend, 
we just came up empty. I think 
that’s why we’re just looking 
at getting the three points and 
basically a split this weekend.”
Morgan’s late-game play gave 
Michigan hope momentarily, but 
the offense couldn’t overcome 
its woes and the late goal wasn’t 
enough to eke out a victory.

‘M’ dominated by Texas 
in Gulf Coast Showcase

Michigan’s quick start — a 
string 
of 
three 
consecutive 
layups offensively — did not 
last. In fact, by the end of the 
first quarter, it was as if that 
two-minute spell hadn’t even 
happened.
Texas proceeded to rattle 
off 19 straight points before the 
Wolverines managed another 
basket, building up a 23-8 lead 
heading into the second quarter.
Michigan (4-1) never really 
recovered from that sequence, 
as the No. 10 Longhorns (5-0) 
staved off any sign of a comeback 
en route to a 69-52 win in the 
Gulf Coast Showcase semifinal.
Though the Wolverines were 
coming off a quality win against a 
ranked Missouri team on Friday, 
Texas was a class above anything 
they had faced so far in the young 
season. The Longhorns lost a few 
substantial players from last 
year’s team, but they retained 
multiple starters and reloaded 
with the nation’s second-ranked 
recruiting class.
Their size and talent proved 
too much for Michigan to 
overcome. 
The 
Wolverines 
usually match up with teams 
well, especially because of senior 
center Hallie Thome’s influence 
inside. This was not the case 
Saturday.
Texas’ 
6-foot-4 
starting 
center Jatarie White controlled 
the paint, rendering Thome 
somewhat ineffective offensively, 
as she finished with just eight 
points in 30 minutes.
“I think their physicality 
surprised us at first,” said 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico. “I think we tried to go 
inside and they were really 
bumping, really being physical, 
really pushing us off the block. 
They sent double teams right 
away. We weren’t used to that.”
On 
the 
wings, 
Michigan 
didn’t fare much better. Both 
sophomore Deja Church and 
senior Nicole Munger struggled 

to find their mark, shooting 7-for-
29 
collectively. 
Alternatively, 
Longhorn guard Audrey Warren, 
a member of that highly-ranked 
recruiting class, poured in 15 on 
6-of-9 shooting.
All 
of 
the 
Wolverines’ 
offensive 
struggles 
— 
chief 
among them being a 13.9-percent 
shooting clip — culminated in 
just six second-quarter points, 
which allowed the Longhorns to 
open up a 25-point lead heading 
into the locker room.
“I think it’s important, as 
much as we think we have an 
experienced team with Hallie 
and (Munger), there are a lot of 
young kids,” Barnes Arico said. 
“A lot of young kids are getting 
a lot of minutes, so I think they 
need to understand this is a top 
team in the country. This is how 
physical the game is going to be. 
If we want to be at this level, this 
is how we are going to need to 
compete.”
One of the lone bright spots 
for the Wolverines was the play 
of freshman point guard Amy 
Dilk, who once again showed 
signs of settling into her starting 
role. Thanks in part to her 
performance in the second half, 
Michigan clawed back late to 
avoid a blowout scoreline.
“I 
think 
she’s 
growing 
more and more comfortable,” 
Barnes Arico said. “And (she’s) 
understanding 
what 
the 
expectations are. I was really 
happy that she attacked the rim 
a little bit more and looked to be 
offensively aggressive.”
The Wolverines regained some 
semblance of confidence with 
their second-half performance — 
shooting 45.5-percent from the 
field.
Another positive for Michigan 
was the return of junior guard 
Akienreh Johnson from injury. 
Though she won’t factor into the 
starting lineup, she does provide 
a bit more depth going forward.

Offensive miscues stall Michigan in 62-39 loss

COLUMBUS — Shea Patterson 
took a few steps back, cocked 
his arm and let the football roll 
off his fingers. It was a dime of a 
pass, flying directly through the 
air towards senior tight end Zach 
Gentry, who was open for the catch 
in the endzone. He outstretched 
his arms, just barely grabbing the 
ball.
But there was no touchdown.
Instead, the ball fell to the 
ground, slipping through Gentry’s 
fingers and bouncing on the scarlet 
turf. In that instant, with Ohio 
State leading 7-3 early in the second 
quarter, a touchdown would have 
given Michigan the lead for the 
first time during Saturday’s game 
in Columbus.
Instead, 
freshman 
kicker 
Jake Moody made his way onto 

the field to make the most of a 
fourth-down, 31-yard field goal 
opportunity. With the swipe of 
his leg, he secured Michigan three 
points for the second time during 
that game, keeping 
the 
Wolverines 
close at 7-6 — but 
still without the 
lead.
Even 
with 
Moody’s six-point 
contribution 
through the first 
two 
quarters, 
common 
lapses 
in 
the 
offense 
throughout 
Saturday’s 
game 
were 
complemented by a defense that 
struggled to stall the Buckeyes’ 
offensive onslaught. In a game 
with 
Big 
Ten 
Championship 
and 
College 
Football 
Playoff 
implications on the line, and a 

rivalry game with Ohio State, no 
less, those collective struggles 
contributed to the Wolverines’ 
62-39 loss.
“This is why everybody comes to 
Michigan, to play 
in this game,” 
Patterson 
said. 
“That’s one of 
the reasons why 
I came here. As a 
child, I dreamed 
of 
playing 
in 
this game. You 
know, I’m the 
quarterback, and 
I have the ball in 
my hand every 
snap, and I take full responsibility 
for our faults on offense.”
The offense, in some moments, 
provided flashes of optimism. Late 
in the second quarter, Patterson 
connected 
with 
sophomore 
wide receiver Nico Collins on 

a 23-yard catch for Michigan’s 
first touchdown of the game. Six 
seconds on the clock later, after 
junior wide receiver Nate Schoenle 
recovered an Ohio State fumble, 
the 
Wolverines 
scored 
again 
courtesy of a nine-yard pass from 
Patterson to junior running back 
Chris Evans.
But, for every bright spot, 
there 
was 
another 
miscue. 
Another dropped ball, a penalty 
drawn, a missed opportunity to 
move the ball forward. Another 
reason Michigan was never able 
to establish that lead over the 
Buckeyes.
Late in the third period, the 
Wolverines struggled to close a 
34-19 gap. After senior running 
back Karan Higdon was tackled for 
a loss of two yards when rushing 
the ball, and Gentry missed a 
potential first-down catch off a 
hit that triggered a concussion, 
Patterson found himself facing 
pressure in the pocket.
Once again, he cocked his arm 
back and threw it, directed at the 
sideline — but this time, it landed 
directly in the hands of Ohio State 
safety Jordan Fuller, who ran it 
four yards before junior tight end 
Sean McKeon ended the drive.
“Sometimes you get desperate 
in those types of situations,” 
Patterson said. “I wasn’t really 
trying to force it, I was actually 
trying to throw the ball out of 
bounds. 
Whoever 
made 
that 
play made a good play and hit my 
elbow.”
Between quarterback Dwayne 
Haskins and running back Mike 
Weber, the interception soon 
turned into a touchdown to put 
the Buckeyes up, 41-19. Another 
interception 
from 
freshman 
quarterback Joe Milton resulted 
in Ohio State’s final touchdown, 
a 62-point total by the end of the 
game. 
In a day in which nothing went 
right for Michigan, the offense 
sputtered when it needed to seize 
control. The Wolverines ended up 
with 39 points, but it was the ones 
they left on the field that they will 
remember.

Wolverines’ defense 
shredded in 62-39 loss

COLUMBUS — Nearly four 
hours after kickoff, the sun 
shined down on Ohio Stadium 
for the first time.
If it was a sign, it wasn’t for 
Michigan.
The scoreboard read 55-32 
and would finish 62-39 in favor 
of the Buckeyes. The 62 points 
allowed by the No. 1 defense in 
the country were the most ever 
scored on the Wolverines in a 
regulation game, surpassing 56 
points allowed over a century 
ago to Cornell. Where Michigan 
made all the wrong history, it 
now finds itself absent again 
from a Big Ten Championship 
and 
potential 
national 
title 
hopes.
This 
wasn’t 
supposed 
to 
happen to his team, nothing 
remotely close, especially this 
season. Jim Harbaugh knew 
that Ohio State had never even 
eclipsed 50 points in the rivalry 
game. 
On 
an 
afternoon 
of 
unfettered domination, that stat 
was the only thing Harbaugh 
had an answer for.
“They 
had 
several 
successful 
plays, 
no 
question about 
it,” 
Harbaugh 
said. 
“They 
got some real 
speed 
plays, 
crossing routes. 
Threw the ball 
downfield well, 
I thought their 
protection was really good. We 
didn’t get the pressure on the 
quarterback that we wanted to.”
The list could read like its 
own history book. Buckeyes 
quarterback Dwayne Haskins 
throttled 
Michigan 
for 
318 passing yards and five 
touchdowns 
to 
become 
the 
single-season, all-time Big Ten 
leader in both categories.
Haskins 
didn’t 
just 
have 
answers, he had lessons. 
“We seen a lot of man coverage, 
lot of one high, so we knew that 
we could get a lot of one-on-one 
matchups and crossing routes on 
them,” Haskins said. “And made 
some plays when it mattered the 
most.
“I was licking my chops, I see 
the one-high covers and that’s 
a quarterback’s dream. The 
biggest responsibility for me all 
week was to be able to pick up 
blitzes and protection, because 
we saw a lot of different fronts 
and excotic looks. I spent hours 
in the film room just trying to 
figure out how we can pick the 
blitzes up.
“And once we picked it up, 
receivers make plays, and I’m 
going to put it there.”
The 
Wolverines 
had 
no 
response to the multitude of 
crossing 
patterns 
over 
the 
middle, let alone everything 
else thrown their way. Fifty-
one yards and a score came off 
crossing routes on Ohio State’s 
first drive — a 24-yarder to Chris 
Olave. It had three more on its 
second touchdown of the day, 
a 27-yard encore from Olave. 

Rinse, repeat.
“We 
try 
to 
stay 
upbeat 
throughout the whole game 
and trust each other and stay in 
the fight, but I don’t remember 
a point where it just got out of 
hand,” said senior safety Tyree 
Kinnel. “It slowly devastated 
us throughout the game, and 
knowing all the yards they 
were putting up, it was tough, 
extremely tough.”
Even in man-to-man press 
coverage that had rarely failed 
Michigan the previous 11 games, 
it simply got burned — Ohio State 
had 16 plays with double-digit 
yardage, including a 78-yard 
rush by Parris Campbell.
It may have been consistent 
with the defense’s day-long 
malaise. But it certainly was a 
byproduct of a pass rush that 
finished with zero sacks and 
quarterback pressures, leaving 
the secondary to cover for longer 
than it has all year.
“A-plus job,” Haskins said of 
his offensive line. “Zero sacks. I 
have to take them out to dinner. 
… I really had all day in the 
pocket.” 
After trailing just 24-19 after 
the first half, the 
defensive 
woes 
looked mendable. 
The 
Wolverines 
had surrendered 
just 
10 
third 
quarter 
points 
all year prior to 
Saturday. But if 
the non-stop, first 
half punches were 
any 
indication, 
this was not going 
to be like any Saturday.
Junior 
cornerback 
David 
Long left the game from a hip 
flexor on the first series of the 
second half. On the second 
series, Rashan Gary and Devin 
Bush needed medical attention 
on back-to-back plays. When 
help was needed most, there was 
nowhere to look.
“We made adjustments at 
halftime, addressed the issues 
we had in the first half,” Kinnel 
said. “And they came out and 
beat us with something else 
in the second half. … They 
completely beat us today.”
Unprepared, 
confused, 
sluggish. 
No 
one 
word 
encapsulates the otherworldly 
hurt that the Buckeyes inflicted. 
For defensive coordinator Don 
Brown, the onslaught pushed 
him past anger, and into a simple 
gratitude for coaching. 
“He just went and talked to 
every guy individually and said 
that he was proud of us, we’re 
a great unit, he loved to coach 
us,” Kinnel said of Brown. “They 
were pretty all positive in the 
locker room, but everyone’s 
down right now.
“They completely beat us 
everywhere. Run game, pass 
game — everyone’s to blame.”
With 
the 
sun 
continuing 
to beat down on the field that 
Michigan couldn’t compete on, 
the game clock struck zero and 
the Wolverines were put out of 
their misery. Fans rushed the 
field.
Ohio State beat Michigan at 
its own game.
