Garden City resident Aimee 
Stephens became a funeral 
director for one reason: to 
help people. Despite facing 
hardship in her personal life, 
Stephens found comfort in 
the knowledge she enabled 
individuals to memorialize 
those they loved. 
Stephens, 
a 
transgender 
woman, said she knew she 
was a woman from the age 
of five. After a lifetime of 
suppressing 
her 
identity, 

Stephens began to live as a 
woman, dressing as a man 
only while at work in the 
funeral home’s distinct male 
and female uniforms. 
Stephens had worked at 
R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral 
Home in Garden City for 
nearly six years. In 2013, her 
lifelong 
internal 
struggle 
with gender identity came to 
a head, and Stephens decided 
to announce her intention to 
live fully as a woman to her 
co-workers. In an interview 
with the Detroit Free Press, 
Stephens 
described 
the 

moment she told her boss her 
gender identity — through a 
letter. 
“We just went into the 
chapel to talk … I gave him 
the letter, he read it, he 
folded it up and put it in his 
coat pocket, and he said, ‘I’ll 
have to think about this,’” 
Stephens said. 
 She went on to recount the 
moment her boss fired her.
“That was pretty much all 
that was said for two weeks 
… he comes back in one 
afternoon and he says … ‘This 
is not going to work.’ That’s 

pretty much all he said, and 
he handed me basically a 
letter firing me and offering 
me what I took it to be as hush 
money to keep my mouth 
shut, and basically sign away 
any rights I may or may not 
have,” Stephens said. 
Instead of accepting the 
money, Stephens sued with 
the backing of the Equal 
Employment 
Opportunity 
Commission, 
a 
federal 
agency enforcing civil rights 
law 
against 
workplace 
discrimination.

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-NINE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

About 56 students, faculty 
and community members came 
to Haven Hall Wednesday to 
hear Morgan State University 
professor Harold D. Morales 
speak about his new book, 
“Latino and Muslim in America: 
Race, Religion, and the Making 
of a New Minority.” The event 
was sponsored by the Romance 
Languages 
and 
Literature, 
Global Islamic Studies Center, 
Department 
of 
American 
Culture, Multi-Ethnic Student 

Affairs, Latina/o Studies and La 
Casa. 
Morales started off with 
statistics of Latinx Muslim 
representation in the United 
States population. According 
to Morales’s research, there is 
a high concentration of Latinx 
Muslims in Northeastern and 
West Coast states, including 
California 
and 
New 
York. 
In addition, he said by the 
year 2043, the United States 
will be the first nation where 
the current racial minority 
populations will outnumber the 
racial majority population.

As an example of a prominent 
Latinx Muslim, Morales shared 
a video of Hamza Perez, a 
Puerto Rican-American rapper 
who converted to Islam. In the 
video, Perez labeled himself as 
“America’s Worst Nightmare” 
because of his shared identities 
as Puerto Rican, Muslim and a 
rapper. 
Morales said he disagrees 
with the idea that being a 
minority is a negative feature.
“So, he’s got all of these 
things that are often portrayed 
as negative stereotypes and 
they’re lumped all together, and 

all of a sudden, it’s amplifying 
the 
negativity 
somehow,” 
Morales said. “Why in the world 
would you choose to increase 
your marginality? Why would 
you choose to increase the 
discrimination that you will 
experience? There are certain 
assumptions that are being 
made about what is lacking and 
what is Islam or Islamic identity, 
and I think that’s really telling 
and important to keep in mind.”

This 
month, 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan 
announced the creation of 
a faculty working group 
dedicated to recommending 
revisions to two Regents 
bylaws 
addressing 
the 
dismissal 
of 
tenured 
faculty. The two bylaws 
include 
the 
University’s 
standard procedure in cases 
of faculty dismissal, as well 
as severance pay. 
The 
announcement 
of 
the 
working 
group 
comes 
after 
School 
of 
Music, Theatre & Dance 
Professor 
David 
Daniels 
was 
accused 
of 
sexual 
assault by former student 
Samuel Schultz in August 
2018. Just a few months 
later, 
Andrew 
Lipian, 
another former student of 
Daniels’s, filed a lawsuit 
claiming he was sexually 
assaulted 
by 
Daniels 
in 
March 2017. In July of 
this year, the University 
began the process of firing 
Daniels, who was placed on 
paid leave after Schultz’s 
allegations 
were 
made 
public.

Washtenaw 
County sprayed
to combat the 
spread of EEE

Deadly disease with no cure or vaccine 
can lead to rare brain infections

When LSA junior Zoe Garden 
arrived on campus this semester 
as a transfer student, she had 
completed 
many 
beginner 
and 
upper-level 
courses 
in 
communications 
— 
including 
an 
entry-level 
communication 
studies course — at her previous 
school. 
Yet, 
because 
of 
the 
University of Michigan’s transfer 
requirements, she found herself 
enrolling 
in 
Communication 
Studies 101 this semester.
“I always say that I feel like 
a freshman here on campus, 
because I obviously don’t know 
the campus as well and stuff like 
that, but sometimes being in these 
classes with all these freshmen, 
you just kind of feel like you’re 
out of place,” Garden said. “You 
come here to Michigan for more 
opportunities, but I feel like I’m 
being set back more than pushed 
forward sometimes.”
Garden, who transferred to 
the University from Oakland 
University, a four-year college 
located in Auburn Hills, Mich., 
said introductory communication 
courses at the two schools were 
comparable — both were 100-level 
courses in the Communication 
& Media department covering 
similar subject matter.

A portion of northern 
Washtenaw 
County 
was aerially sprayed to 
combat the spread of a 
mosquito-borne 
virus 
last 
Saturday 
night, 
according 
to 
Susan 
Ringler 
Cerniglia, 
Communications 
and 
Community 
Health 
Promotion Administrator 
at the Washtenaw County 
Health Department.
The 
decision 
to 
conduct aerial spraying 
came after the Michigan 
Department 
of 
Health 
and 
Human 
Services 
contacted 
WCHD 
on 
Sept. 
29 
about 
the 
spread 
of 
the 
virus 
called 
Eastern 
Equine 
Encephalitis. 
MDHHS 
recommended 
WCHD 
and Livingston County 
Health 
Department 
participate 
in 
aerial 

spraying after an animal 
with EEE was found in 
neighboring 
Livingston 
County on Monday, Sept. 
30. 
Cerniglia said WCHD 
was given short notice 
about 
the 
proposed 
spraying and ended up 
participating 
in 
the 
MDHHS-coordinated 
spraying.
“As 
a 
local 
health 
department, 
we 
have 
to 
prioritize 
reducing 
their risk of a potentially 
deadly 
infectious 

illness,” Cerniglia said.
When transmitted by 
mosquitoes 
to 
another 
organism, EEE can lead 
to a rare brain infection. 
According to the Centers 
for Disease Control and 
Prevention, 
the 
virus 
is fatal to 30 percent of 
those infected. There is 
no cure or vaccine for the 
virus. 
The CDC also noted 

Dr. Harold D. Morales, associate professor at Morgan State university, discusses the changing demographics in the United States and the relationship between Muslim 
and LatinX identities at the LatinX and Muslim in America Lecture at Haven Hall Wednesday.

Daily Staff Reporter


LSA and Music, Theatre & 
Dance sophomore Tal Kamin 
started We Are Queens, a female 
empowerment 
organization, 
while reflecting on her summer 
experiences 
in 
the 
theater 
industry. 
“I was talking to my best 
friend the night before it all 
started,” Kamin said. “We were 
talking about our experiences, 
whether that be in relationships 
or professional pursuits, and 
started realizing how hard it was 
for us to not feel like we were 
constantly being labeled for our 
behavior in whatever capacity 
that meant.”
It was during that conversation 
that 
Kamin 
realized 
how 

common it was for girls her age to 
put themselves down and focus 
on the negativity in their lives. 
With a desire to change what she 
felt had become a social norm, 
Kamin was inspired to create a 
30-day challenge. 
This was the official initiative 
that jumpstarted what has now 
become the We Are Queens 
organization. On Aug. 9, the 
GroupMe 
30-day 
challenge 
called “Bridge the GAP” was 
launched. Girls would share one 
thing they were grateful for, 
one affirmation and one thing 
they were proud of through 
an ongoing public group chat. 
With 400 females joining the 
challenge from across the world 
in just two days, Kamin realized 
the power of having a strong 
community of females and the 

potential to take this further. 
“Our mission was and still 
is about empowering young 
females individually, fostering 
a community in that realm and 
giving back to the rest of society,” 
Kamin said. 
As a female empowerment 
organization, We Are Queens 
seeks to create change through 
events, social media movements, 
benefit performances and other 
activities that foster a safe space 
for women to feel confident in 
themselves in a world that may 
otherwise put them down. 
According 
to 
Kamin, 
the 
values of We Are Queens, as well 
as the initial 30-day challenge, 
make it appealing to a global 
audience. She explained that 
the positivity of the community 
fosters its growth, rather than a 
formalized business plan 
or 
an 
entrepreneurial 
strategy. 
“It really does come from 
a pure place of wanting to 
make a difference,” Kamin 
said. “It’s not driven by 
capitalistic desires. The 
fact that I am a human and 
I am relatable makes this a 
platform where girls want 
to join not only because 
they are seeking help or 
see this as a groupie, but 
they understand that this 
is an opportunity to come 
to terms with themselves 
alongside other girls.” 
For Kamin, We Are 
Queens has also become 
an outlet to reflect on 
her 
personal 
values. 
Kamin said the culture 
of the dance industry 
has trained her to be 
hyperware of potential 
flaws and competition. 
“Within 
the 
dance 
community, where you’re 
constantly 
auditioning, 
constantly 
looking 
at 
yourself in the mirror 

and criticizing yourself while 
being compared to other girls, 
I saw that the dynamic of self 
worth and self value was not 
as strong as it could and should 
be,” Kamin said. 
Music, Theatre & Dance 
senior Emily Goodrich is the 
marketing director for We Are 
Queens and met Kamin through 
the school. Sympathetic to 
the pressures that initially led 
Kamin to create the challenge 
initiative, Goodrich was drawn 
toward the mission statement 
values. 
“I love her cause to get women 
together to encourage each other 
in such a demanding industry,” 
Goodrich said. “We tend to 
gravitate towards competition 
but I think this could be the 
wave of the future, for teaching 
like-minded females to support 
and encourage one another.”
Having 
compiled 
an 
executive team of six women, 
including 
Goodrich, 
Kamin 
is planning on adding more 
tangible events to showcase 
the power of empowerment 
and self-love. Expanding into 
industries beyond what she 
is familiar with 
 
– dance and 
theater – she hopes to create 
a movement that is open to 
everyone. 
In just two months, We Are 
Queens has produced two music 
videos: one to Beyoncé’s “Run 
The World” and another to 
P!nk’s “Hustle”, which focused 
on a more intimate journey of 
female self-discovery. 
“The Beyoncé music video 
really went viral and was our 
first public social media event,” 
Kamin said. “We had hundreds 
of comments and views and this 
was a really tangible way for us 
to use art specifically to get the 
word out.”

However, 
in 
order 
to 
declare the major, she had 
to take the University’s 
course.
As 
a 
result, 
Garden 
will 
graduate 
from 
the 
University a year later than 
she would have graduated 
from Oakland if she had 
stayed. Garden is one of 
many students who feel as 
if they have to backtrack 
to graduate with a degree 
from Michigan. 
According 
to 
the 
University’s 
transfer 
page, 
courses 
taken 
at 
other institutions closely 
matching 
those 
offered 
at the University will be 
transferred as “equivalent 
credit,” meaning they will 
appear with the University 
course number listed on the 
student’s transcripts.
Credits from departments 
similar to those available 
at 
the 
University 
are 
listed 
as 
“departmental 
credit.” While these can 
be used to fulfill elective 
requirements, 
students 
need 
special 
permission 
from an adviser to use 
them for concentration or 
distribution requirements.
According 
to 
early 
numbers 
from 
2019, 
the 
University 
had 
approximately 1,450 new 
transfer 
students 
enroll 
from 
an 
applicant 
pool 
of 
approximately 
4,400. 
Nationally, 
about 
25 
percent of students who 
begin college at a four-
year institution transfer to 
another at some point.
University alum Cecilia 
LaCroix, 
who 
graduated 
in May 2019, completed 
the 
International 
Baccalaureate 
program 
and Advanced Placement 
courses at her high school. 
Paired with two years of 
coursework 
at 
Central 
Michigan University, she 
had 86 total credits before 
transferring.
But when she enrolled 
at the University, she was 
only able to transfer 60 
credits due to an LSA policy 
requiring at least half of 
the 
120 
credits 
needed 
to graduate be taken on 
campus.
Like 
Garden, 
LaCroix 
intended 
to 
major 
in 
Communication 
Studies, 
now 
renamed 
Communication 
& 
Media. 
She 
had 
taken 
Communication 
101, 
Journalism 
101 
and 
Advertising 
101 
at 
Central 
Michigan, 
but 
she 
was 
still 
required 
to take the University’s 
Communication Studies 101 
course to declare the major.
This was not the only 
time she ran into issues in 
the department, LaCroix 
said. Her coursework in 
advertising, communication 
and journalism completed 
at CMU would only be listed 
as 
departmental 
credit, 
meaning it could not satisfy 
requirements for her major.
LaCroix said she switched 
her major because of this. 
She said she felt she was 
relearning information she 
was already taught in her 
courses at CMU to the point 
that she stopped showing 
up to class.

“As a senior, I was sitting 
in classes with freshmen 
— 
first-time 
college 
students 
— 
and 
they’re 
[the instructors are] like, 
‘This is how you write an 
essay,’ and I was so checked 
out. 
I 
absolutely 
hated 
it,” LaCroix said. “I even 
thought 
about 
returning 
back to Central just because 
I was so bored. I found 
myself skipping a lot of 
classes and just phoning it 
in, because it was material 
I had already learned, and 
it was material I was paying 
for.”
Other 
students 
agreed 
there is variation among 
departments 
as 
to 
the 
likelihood 
of 
credits 
transferring. 
LSA 
junior 
Gustavo 
D’Mello, 
who 
transferred from Michigan 
State University after his 
freshman year, said many of 
his history courses counted 
as equivalent credits, but 
his Calculus I course — 
which was offered through 
MSU’s 
health 
sciences 
residential college Lyman 
Briggs College — did not.
Instead 
of 
repeating 
intro-level 
calculus, 
D’Mello decided to take 
Calculus II in his first 
semester at the University 
so he could declare his 
Economics major. However, 
when he went to declare 
the major and register for 
classes for the following 
semester, 
he 
ran 
into 
trouble.The Office of the 
Registrar had accidentally 
not transferred D’Mello’s 
credits over from MSU, 
and he was listed as having 
completed zero credits (not 
including Calculus II and 
the other classes currently 
he was currently enrolled 
in at the University). 
The University’s system 
for 
course 
registration 
assigns students a sign-up 
time and date depending on 
the number of credit hours 
they have completed, so the 
Office of the Registrar’s 
mistake 
meant 
D’Mello 
was 
registering 
behind 
everyone else, even though 
he was going into his second 
semester 
of 
sophomore 
year.
“I was alongside all the 
freshmen, 
even 
though 
I was a second semester 
sophomore, 
so 
I 
had 
really late dates for all my 
classes,” D’Mello said. “I 
was waitlisted for all my 
classes for a while. It was 
kind of a nightmare.”
Garden and LaCroix both 
said the alienating feelings 
they have experienced in the 
introductory-level courses 
stem 
from 
the 
classes 
being primarily composed 
of underclassmen. While 
Garden said she was able to 
find a community through 
the Transfer Connections 
learning 
community 
— 
which nearly 200 students 
participated in last year 
— she recognized others 
do 
not 
have 
this 
same 
opportunity, as it required 
a time investment from the 
student. 
LaCroix said being in 
the 
introductory 
class, 
as opposed to a smaller 
upper-level course, made 
it more difficult to make 
friends and feel a sense of 
belonging at the University.
“The maturity level was 
off,” LaCroix said. “People 

were still talking about 
prom, and I was just trying 
to phone in my assignment.”
LSA junior Paige Dotson, 
who 
transferred 
from 
DePaul 
University, 
was 
told she had to take a first-
year writing course at the 
University, 
even 
though 
she 
had 
already 
taken 
a 
comparable 
course 
at 
DePaul.Because 
she 
had 
taken journalism courses 
and collaborated on projects 
with 
the 
Chicago 
Sun-
Times, she said she felt the 
course was unnecessary. 
Dotson 
had 
completed 
a 
course 
that 
satisfied 
the 
upper-level 
writing 
requirement, but said she 
has yet to take the first-
year course and believes 
she shouldn’t have to.
“As a 22-year-old who 
has been in college for a 
while, it doesn’t make me 
feel great that I have to 
take 
freshman 
classes,” 
Dotson said. “Having had 
that background, and then 
having to be told, ‘No, you 
need to take time, you need 
to take a four credit class’ for 
something that you already 
know how to do is a little 
aggravating, and I’m still 
trying to fight it because I 
don’t see really the point 
of it. I would understand 
more if I had just been a 
student the whole time, and 
I had just been avoiding 
it, but that’s not really the 
case. It’s a matter of the 
University and their system 
of transferring.”
Additionally, Dotson has 
had to add an extra year 
to 
her 
studies 
because 
although she has completed 
her major and distribution 
requirements, she has not 
hit the 120-credit threshold 
to graduate.
Dotson 
said 
part 
of 
her credit number stems 
from how the University 
transferred 
her 
DePaul 
credits. 
Because 
DePaul 
operates 
on 
a 
quarter 
system and the University 
does not, her courses were 
not worth the same amount 
of credit hours as when she 
completed them at DePaul. 
However, Dotson said she 
recognizes 
her 
situation 
is better than many other 
transfer 
students. 
Her 
introductory 
biology 
and 
chemistry 
classes, 
for 
example, 
transferred 
completely and she was not 
required to retake them.
While 
the 
transfer 
students generally agreed 
having 
to 
take 
similar 
introductory classes to ones 
they completed at their old 
schools was only a minor 
setback, some said it made 
them feel out of place at 
their new school.
Garden said that while it 
only took one semester for 
her to take the prerequisite 
communication 
studies 
courses, it felt like a step in 
the wrong direction.
“It is a little annoying 
just going from being in 
those (upper-level courses) 
and being in 101s again,” 
Garden 
said. 
“It’ll 
only 
really be this semester — 
next semester I’ll be in 
those classes — but it’s just 
a little bit like, ‘Oh, God, I’m 
so excited to come here for 
more opportunities,’ and 
here I am, back in a 101.”

areas 
of 
Michigan 
are 
increasingly at risk for 
EEE because of warmer 
weather. Nine people have 
been infected in Michigan, 
leading to three fatalities. 

Thirty 
animal 
cases 
of EEE have also been 
confirmed in 15 Michigan 
counties.
Joseph 
Eisenberg, 
professor 
and 
chair 
of 
the 
Department 
of 
Epidemiology at the School 
of Public Health, said the 
EEE virus is rare and part 
of a family of viruses, 
including West Nile and 
Saint Louis Encephalitis 
virus. He explained all 
three have been around 
for a while and pop up in 
different areas of the U.S.
Eisenberg mentioned the 
best way to combat EEE is 
through mosquito control 
and exposure as well as 
monitoring the host of the 
virus, birds, periodically 
as a warning system. He 
added monitoring whether 
there 
is 
viral 
activity 
in 
birds 
is 
challenging 
because of limited funding 
for rare viruses like EEE.
“We 
always 
want 
to 
make sure that we are 
minimizing 
mosquito 
exposure the best we can 
… and (using) mosquito 
repellent for individuals 
is one main thing from a 
public health perspective,” 
Eisenberg said.
LSA freshman Nayomie 
Allen, who is from St. 
Joseph County, said she 
was not aware of the EEE 
outbreak before talking to 
one of her family members. 
Allen said there was aerial 
spraying in her city after 
multiple animals with EEE 
were 
found. 
She 
added 
her family members were 
not aware of the planned 
spraying 
and 
believes 
residents should have been 
warned 
and 
offered 
an 
opportunity to opt-out.
“...I think they’re just 
trying to do what they 
could in the moment to 
prevent other people from 
getting it, so it was a good 
idea...but 
they 
should 
have probably sent out a 
warning,” Allen said. 
WCHD posted a page 
on 
their 
website 
with 

information 
about 
how 
residents 
could 
opt-out 
of the spraying that took 
place last Saturday night. 
Cerniglia explained there 
would not have been any 
spraying 
if 
there 
were 
enough 
residents 
who 
opted out. She added the 
majority of the treatment 
area was in Livingston 
County, so WCHD did not 
hear from the neighboring 
county.
According to the website, 
the EPA-registered spray 
Merus 3.0 “was sprayed 
by a low-flying aircraft 
at a very low volume of 
around 
one 
tablespoon 
per acre.” Cerniglia added 
the spray has been used 
in other states and has 
shown to control mosquito 
populations 
effectively. 
She said its use in other 
states helped WCHD make 
the decision to participate 
in the aerial spraying.
Cerniglia 
also 
cited 
several 
concerns 
from 
residents 
about 
the 
potential 
ecological 
effects of the spray. 
“The goal is to reduce 
the mosquito population,” 
Cerniglia 
said. 
“There’s 
been a lot of concern from 
other people based on bees 
and other animals that we 
don’t want to kill off, and, 
of course, we would never 
want to do anything that 
was potentially harmful 
to 
people. 
It’s 
really 
important to understand 
the way it’s being applied.”
When asked about his 
opinion 
on 
the 
aerial 
spraying, Eisenberg said 
the 
benefits 
outweigh 
the costs. He added the 
spraying could minimize 
the risks associated with 
transmission, 
especially 
because 
the 
mosquitoes 
could also be transmitting 
the West Nile virus. 
“In the context that we 
now have an outbreak that 
is actually killing people, 
I think that the spraying 
is warranted,” Eisenberg 
said. “It’s not necessarily 
warranted as a preventive 
measure 
in 
the 
future 
when we don’t have an 
outbreak.”
Cerniglia 
explained 
some of the concerns from 
residents may stem from 
mistrust.
“No 
doubt, 
there’s 
a 
lot of concern and really 
what fuels into that is 

mistrust and, you know, 
even though we may be 
able to provide some of 
this information, people 
don’t necessarily believe it 
or trust it,” Cerniglia said.
Cerniglia said the short 
notice from MDHHS made 
it 
difficult 
to 
schedule 
a 
community 
meeting, 
but there was a meeting 
addressing 
EEE 
virus 
on 
Oct. 
3 
in 
Webster 
Township.
Cerniglia 
mentioned 
residents were concerned 
about the lack of notice 
even 
though 
her 
office 
“actively 
shared” 
new 
information 
once 
they 
received 
it. 
She 
added 
WCHD posted updated EEE 
virus information on their 
website, 
press 
releases 
and sent information to 
commissioners, 
but 
she 
emphasized it’s a challenge 
to directly reach every 
resident in the current 
information environment.
“We’re 
committed 
to 
listening to people and 
talking 
through 
it, 
but 
unfortunately, we had to 
make this difficult decision 
and we do hope … we can 
kind of open dialogue with 
community members and 
other organizations about 
this 
type 
of 
response, 
which is considered (an) 
emergency response,” she 
said. 
Cerniglia 
said 
WCHD 
will be on the lookout for 
any additional EEE cases 
that may warrant another 
aerial spraying.
Eisenberg mentioned a 
program focused on killing 
mosquito larvae would be 
most beneficial to prevent 
another 
outbreak 
of 
a 
mosquito-borne disease.
Cerniglia 
said 
WCHD 
will look into integrated 
mosquito 
control 
programs, which occur in 
other parts of the U.S. so 
that there is a less likely 
chance 
for 
emergency 
responses like this one.
“That 
may 
be 
an 
investment 
that 
local 
communities, as well as 
the state, can re-look at 
and prioritize, especially 
if there’s concern about 
the changing climate and 
if this type of infectious 
problem 
may 
occur,” 
Cerniglia said.

EEE

A 
Michigan 
Daily 
investigation 
found 
the 
University knew about Daniels’s 
behavior 
in 
2018 
but 
still 
awarded him with tenure that 
same year.
Daniels’s case, which is still 
ongoing, sparked conversations 
about 
how 
the 
University 
should respond to allegations of 
misconduct when the professor 
in question has received tenure. 
Daniels made tenure on May 17, 
2018, just a few months before 
the accusations were revealed 
to the public.
The committee is composed of 
nine faculty members across the 
three University campuses and 
is chaired by Sharon Glotzer, 

department chair of chemical 
engineering and professor in 
the College of Engineering. The 
group is tasked with reviewing 
the 
University’s 
policies 
in 
relation to peer institutions 
and will recommend revisions 
to the two bylaws. One bylaw, 
which states the termination of 
a tenured faculty’s appointment 
can be initiated by the provost 
or executive vice provost, was 
last revised in 2011. 
According to the University 
Record, the first deadline for 
recommending 
revisions 
to 
University 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel is Nov. 15 and the 
second is Feb. 28, 2020. 
Information 
professor 
Kentaro Toyama is one of the 
faculty members in the working 
group. Toyama explained how 
the group works. 

“Our involvement is basically 
thinking through what the key 
principles are and the values we 
want to uphold in that process 
are, especially with regard to 
tenure,” 
Toyama 
said. 
“But 
(we’re) 
also 
thinking 
about 
the responsible use of public 
resources for people who do end 
up going through that process.”
Toyama said even though the 
two bylaws under review are 
rarely put into practice, they 
can be invoked in serious cases 
such as Daniels’s. Toyama also 
mentioned how the current 
bylaws require the University 
to continue paying all tenured 
faculty members, even if they 
are in the process of being 
dismissed or are on leave. 
“The 
faculty 
member 
in 
question 
committed 
fairly 
egregious 
crimes, 
outright 

crimes, for which the evidence 
seems overwhelmingly against 
the 
person,” 
Toyama 
said. 
“The unfortunate situation is 
despite the fact that most people 
probably would agree that they 
are guilty of the crime, that 
because of the way that 5.09 
and 5.10 are currently worded, 
the University is required to 
continue compensating them 
and 
providing 
benefits 
for 
them.”
LSA 
sophomore 
Emma 
Sandberg was part of a group 
of students that contacted the 
ACLU of Michigan in February 
about the University’s interim 
Title 
IX 
policy. 
Sandberg 
echoed 
Toyama’s 
statement 
and said the process for firing 
Daniels, which is currently in 
its second year, has taken much 
longer than it should have due to 

the severity of Daniels’s crimes. 
“Currently, the process of 
firing a tenured professor is 
far too lengthy, especially in 
cases where that professor has 
committed 
sexual 
assault,” 
Sandberg 
said. 
“What 
I’m 
hoping is that this working 
group was created due to the 
David Daniels case … In that 
case, it was crazy to me how 
slow everything took.”
Sandberg 
said 
the 
University should no longer 
pay tenured faculty who have 
committed 
crimes 
or 
are 
under investigation.
“As a survivor, the thought 
that my tuition is, in part, 
going to a rapist helping to 
pay his legal fees is really 
upsetting,” 
Sandberg 
said. 
“So, I’m glad to hear that this 
working group was created, 

and I do hope that the reason 
for this is to address this 
issue, and I also hope that 
other schools will address 
this issue before it’s a problem 
at their schools, because the 
University of Michigan should 
have fixed this years ago.”
On 
Monday, 
Provost 
Martin Philbert joined the 
Senate Advisory Committee 
on 
University 
Affairs 
to 
announce 
the 
creation 
of 
the working group. Philbert 
stressed the University will 
do everything it can to protect 
the 
institution 
of 
tenure, 
but will also work to amend 
bylaws that no longer serve 
the community effectively.

Ultimately, she took her 
case to the United States Sixth 
Circuit 
Court 
of 
Appeals. 
There, 
the 
court 
ruled 
Harris 
Funeral 
Home 
had 
unlawfully 
fired 
Stephens, 
and had violated Title VII of 
the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 
which 
prevents 
employers 
from engaging in unlawful sex 
discrimination.
Yesterday, Stephens’s case 
was heard in the U.S. Supreme 
Court, 
where 
attorneys 
David Cole and Pam Karlan 
argued Title VII also applies 
to discrimination based on 
gender identity.
Jay Kaplan, staff attorney for 
the ACLU of Michigan’s LGBT 

Project, explained to The Daily 
the organization’s argument, 
which deems any workplace 
decision made on the basis of 
a worker’s gender identity or 
sexuality inherently qualifies 
as discrimination based on sex. 
“You 
can’t 
understand 
anything 
about 
who 
a 
transgender person is without 
considering that person’s sex 
— by definition, a transgender 
individual is someone who 
identifies differently from the 
sex that was assigned to them 
at birth,” Kaplan said. “So, it’s 
pretty obvious, just look at 
the text. When you’re talking 
about gay, lesbian, bisexual 
individuals, 
you 
cannot 
understand 
them 
without 
calling attention to their sex 
and the sex of the person to 
whom they are attracted to.”

The 
defendants, 
on 
the 
other hand, took the argument 
that at the time of Title VII’s 
enactment, 
legislators 
did 
not 
foresee 
the 
potential 
for discrimination based on 
gender identity.
John Bursch, the lawyer 
who argued the case on behalf 
of the funeral home, did not 
respond to The Daily’s request 
for 
comment 
in 
time 
for 
publication. 
Samuel 
Bagenstos, 
a 
former civil rights lawyer and 
professor at the University 
of Michigan’s Law School, 
told The Daily the ideological 
composition of the court may 
factor into how effective this 
argument ends up.

he 
We 
Company 
(formerly known as 
WeWork), a massive 
coworking 
and 
office 
space 
company, 
was 
once the honor of 
Softbank. Softbank 
is 
a 
Japanese 
conglomerate 
that 
has 
been 
making a name for 
itself via massive 
investments either 
directly 
or 
from 
its 
subsidiary, 
the 
Vision 
Fund. 
We 
represented years of work 
and development and was 
one of two shining jewels 
in Softbank’s crown — the 
other, of course, being Uber. 
All of the good press and 
positivity 
culminated 
in 
an eye-popping $47 billion 
valuation for We that recently 
fell so fast and hard that 
their IPO was temporarily 
pulled. Valuations are meant 
to be based on numbers and 
We shouldn’t have fallen 
as quickly as it did, but 
the 
downfall 
might 
have 
demonstrated that it was the 
end of an era.
We’s $47 billion valuation 
is big, but it is not out of the 
norm. In May 2019, Uber was 
valued at $82 billion at their 
IPO and in March 2019 Lyft 
was at $24.3 billion during 
their 
IPO. 
In 
addition, 
DoorDash is planning to go 
public with a valuation of 
$12.6 billion in 2020. Each 
of 
these 
four 
companies 
shares a few traits that made 
these valuations especially 
noteworthy. A big one is a 
lack of profitability. Uber 
reported a $5 billion dollar 
loss 
during 
their 
second 
earnings report, Lyft lost 
$644.2 million during that 
same 
period, 
DoorDash 
was still not profitable, and 
finally, We lost $900 million 
during the first six months of 
2019.
So why then were these 
companies’ 
valuations 
so 
high if not for their profit 
and loss statements? Could it 
be the assets they held? Not 
quite, since Uber, Lyft and 
DoorDash don’t really have 
many assets. People drive 

their own cars for Uber, Lyft 
and DoorDash — they do not 
drive cars owned by those 
companies. 
Along 
these 
lines, 
We 
does not own all of 
its real estate. 
The 
valuations 
were 
neither 
based 
on 
cash 
flow nor assets, so 
what 
then 
could 
it 
be? 
The 
real 
answer lies in a 
deeper issue with 
venture 
capital 
today 
— 
companies 
that 
primarily use software are 
getting treated as software 
companies, which is having 

incredible ramifications on 
their valuations. A similarity 
between these startups and 
software companies is that 
software 
companies 
often 
run big losses at the start but 
eventually 
turn 
profitable 
because the marginal cost is 
close to zero and products 
can scale very efficiently. 
This is not quite true with 
Uber, Lyft, DoorDash or We. 
None of these companies can 
scale like software. Nor can 
the cost be that low, because 
the constraints for them are 
fundamentally 
different. 
Uber, Lyft and DoorDash are 
constrained by the amount 
of people who can and want 
to perform the service, and 
We is constrained by the fact 
that they are unable to buy 
more buildings because the 
marginal cost for skyscrapers 
is not one that typically 
trends downwards — there 
is no two-for-three special 
on Empire State Buildings. 
We’s entire business model 
is based on acquiring real 
estate to turn into coworking 
spaces. That well eventually 

runs dry though, and the 
marginal cost never falls 
off. 
This problem has been 
compounded by the fact 
that a lot of successful 
startups 
(especially 
in 
Silicon Valley) have been 
software companies. As a 
result, when software is 
key to a company’s bottom 
line, 
investors 
are 
more 
interested 
in 
helping 
to 
secure 
funding 
because 
they feel that the valuation 
could rocket up. The crucial 
difference 
is 
that 
while 
all of these companies use 
software, some are actually 
companies 
whose 
bottom 
line is dependent on software 
(Snapchat 
App, 
Facebook 
Website and Instagram App) 
and some are companies that 
merely use software. They 
make their money off of car 
rides, deliveries or rentable 
office space.
So, where does We go 
from here and what does 
this mean for the wider field 
of startups? We is probably 
not a $47 billion company, 
and most startups are not 
either. In the future, more 
attention should be paid to 
these things prior to filing a 
security registry form, also 
known as an S-1. Does this 
mean that the idea behind 
We — coworking — is done? 
It’s doubtful. Coworking will 
still be a lucrative market as 
more and more companies 
eschew modern offices and 
embrace working from home. 
Regarding 
startups 
more 
broadly, this is a time for a 
conversation to understand 
why companies should be 
valued the way they are and 
what that value is really 
based on. If it is based 
on lots of growth, with a 
very 
slight 
potential 
for 
profitability, then obviously 
the system is in need of 
being reworked. If the We 
saga can lead to venture 
capitalists rethinking some 
of 
their 
strategies 
with 
regard 
to 
investing 
and 
valuation, perhaps We’re not 
so screwed after all. 

How did We get here and what’s next?

Choosing yourself isn’t selfish

ANIK JOSHI | COLUMN

I 

constantly 
face 
this 
internal dilemma: Should 
I do what is easiest, or 
should I do what is 
best for me?
This school year 
has 
presented 
me 
with 
numerous 
situations 
of 
differing 
gravity 
with 
the 
common 
thread of internal 
conflict. 
Should 
I 
spend time with my 
friends that I have 
not seen recently, or 
should I take time to unwind 
alone? Should I say yes to 
something just because I know 
people will be disappointed if 
I don’t, or should I do what 
would be the more suitable 
option for myself? Should I 
act in the interests of others 
all of the time, or should I 
consider 
my 
own 
feelings 
more heavily?
I know some of the answers 
to these hypotheticals seem 
self-explanatory, 
but 
as 
someone who, like most, would 
rather entirely refrain from 
saying or doing something 
that upsets or disappoints 
someone, 
these 
situations 
pose genuine internal back-
and-forth.
If college has taught me 
anything, it’s that there is a 
beauty and a sense of maturity 
in determining that sometimes 
the decision that may not be 
popular or expected may be 
the best decision in the long 
run. I have and continue to 
struggle with accepting the 
fact that, sometimes, it is OK 
to put yourself first, even if 
it feels strange or will incur 
judgement.
An April Medium article 
critiques 
the 
construct 
of 
selfishness. 
It 
states 
that 
being selfish is conversely 
selfless. 
Putting 
yourself 
first, it argues, will in turn 
generate 
more 
positive 

personal 
outcomes, 
which 
will benefit the lives of those 
around you. This is a complete 
paradigm 
shift 
from everything we 
have been told. But 
is it true?
There 
is 
a 
societal 
stigma 
around 
putting 
yourself first that 
is synonymous with 
blatant 
disregard 
for others. Putting 
yourself first can 
be frowned upon, 
and we are socialized to 
think in this way early in 
life. I can vividly remember 
my 
parents 
and 
teachers 
reinforcing the concept that 
we should put others before 
ourselves and to put ourselves 

in someone else’s shoes before 
we make a decision, and I 
know this was not a unique 
experience. 
These 
are 
all 
poignant 
considerations, 
and I, by no means, want to 
disregard or devalue them. 
I believe each of us should 
go 
through 
these 
thought 
processes 
intentionally 
and thoughtfully. Yet I also 
believe that there is value in 
prioritizing your own well-
being.
It seems like an obvious 
conclusion to reach, but I know 
that so many of us struggle to 
make decisions that may be 
personally beneficial due to a 
variety of factors — including, 
but not limited to, appeasing 

other’s 
feelings, 
pressure 
from friends or family, or 
pressure from ourselves. I 
am guilty of this. I go places, 
watch speakers or attend 
events, just because I expect 
myself to, even if I genuinely 
have little interest in the 
matter.
With that, as this year 
ramps up, and I find myself 
running from one thing to 
the next, I am going to try 
and carve out more time for 
me. It could be as simple 
as giving myself a break to 
watch a show or go to bed 
an hour earlier one night. I 
think we could all do a little 
bit of the same.
It’s funny that the concept 
of 
prioritizing 
yourself 
can be seen as selfish, but 
picking to go to bed early 
over going to something that 
you feel obligated to attend 
just because, may make you 
overall just a happier human 
being. We have culturally 
shifted into a dialogue that 
sometimes 
neglects 
the 
importance 
of 
self-care 
and internal reflection so 
to ensure that others are 
appeased or that we are 
keeping 
up 
an 
image 
or 
persona that we have become 
accustomed to maintaining. I 
think we need to start moving 
away from those compulsions 
as a means to be a generally 
more fulfilled society. 
I am not advocating for 
cruelty or a general disregard 
toward others. Instead, I am 
advocating for your internal 
dialogue as a compass for 
your decision-making instead 
of what society expects or 
what those around you want. 
Start doing more for you, even 
if it may be tough. I know I am 
going to try.

MARY ROLFES | COLUMN

Saturdays aren’t just for the boys
W

hen 
I 
visited 
Boston 
during 
the 
2018 
World 
Series, I had one objective in 
mind: to celebrate. I had heard 
legendary stories of the city’s 
post-win celebrations and had 
sort of taken part in one after 
the Patriots’ 2017 Super Bowl 
comeback, being a freshman at a 
Boston-area college at the time. 
As the Red Sox came inning 
by inning closer to claiming 
the title, my excitement at the 
prospect of an after-party grew. 
But by paying attention to the 
game and only the game, I failed 
to notice the signs that this 
celebration wouldn’t be nearly as 
legendary as I was hoping — at 
least, not for me.
After the final out, my friends 
and I headed to Boston Common, 
the city’s central public park, in 
an effort to join the city-wide 
celebration. When I arrived, what 
I discovered was not a welcoming 
celebration but an overgrown 
boys’ club. The gathering was 
dominated by college-aged men 
chanting insults at one another, 
acting 
physically 
aggressive 
and vandalizing public property 
– and, of course, there was 
the 
unmissable 
presence 
of 
several red, white and blue flags 
proclaiming in all capital letters, 
“Saturdays are for the boys.” 
This was not a celebration for 
the Red Sox or even the city. 
This was a demonstration of 
hegemonic 
masculinity 
and 
its ability to dominate every 
possible public space and exclude 
those unwilling or unable to join 
in. And it was perpetuated, in 
part, by social media.
Fan groups have the potential 
to bring a community together. 
They can facilitate community 
initiatives, raise awareness and 
have even helped a city heal 
from tragedy. This unifying 
ability is certainly present at 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan, 
home to the biggest stadium in 
the U.S. Unfortunately, sports-
fan culture in the United States 
is entrenched in toxic ideas of 
masculinity. While this has been 
true for decades, the inception 
of social media has significantly 
increased the pervasiveness of 
misogyny by providing an outlet 
for the widespread manifestation 
of these aggressive and sexist 
practices. 
By 
utilizing 
their 
platforms 
to 
normalize 
and 
celebrate sexism, infighting and 
outright violence in athletics, 
sports social media tends to 
highlight the worst aspects of fan 
culture, dividing communities 

rather than uniting them. By 
reconsidering the impact these 
platforms have on our culture, 
and especially on our campus, we 
can support a more positive social 
media presence surrounding our 
teams and embrace fan culture 
as the welcoming, community-
building environment it has the 
potential to be.
Social media has given us the 
ability to connect with others, 
spread ideas and create a more 
connected global community. 
Unfortunately, its impacts do 
have some downsides, and many 
social media outlets have served 
as a platform for perpetuating 
toxic attitudes, including those 
surrounding college athletics. 
One culprit is especially relevant 
to our campus: Barstool Sports. 
Barstool was launched in 2003 
by U-M alum Dave Portnoy. 
Since its founding, the site 
and its many affiliates have 
gained significant social media 
influence, 
posting 
content 

related to sports and college 
culture 
with 
a 
consistently 
misogynistic undertone. Portnoy 
has been a controversial figure in 
sports media. While some have 
praised him for his dedication 
to “unabashed masculinity” and 
anti-politically correct comedy, 
these 
qualities 
have 
drawn 
heavy criticism from others. 
For many years, he has been 
the embodiment of problematic 
behaviors in sports fan culture. 
He is vocally anti-union, claiming 
on Twitter that he would fire any 
employee who dared to consider 
the possibility of unionizing. This 
statement caught the attention of 
U.S. Representative Alexandria 
Ocasio-Cortez, 
D-N.Y., 
as 
Portnoy’s anti-union threats are 
a violation of national labor laws. 
Not even two weeks later, he had 
a few choice words — well, one 
especially sexist choice word 
— in reaction to Andrew Luck’s 
retirement announcement. 
Portnoy’s 
problematic 
attitude is not isolated, either. 

This aggression and sexism 
pervades Barstool Sports and 
its affiliates. On the main site, 
Sex Scandal Teachers is a 
recurring segment in which 
women charged with sexually 
assaulting minors are “graded” 
based on their looks and morals, 
using language that blames 
victims and trivializes sexual 
abuse. Barstool’s affiliates — 
many of which are crafted 
for specific colleges — often 
engage in sharing similarly 
misogynistic 
content. 
This 
includes their “Smokeshow” 
series in which female college 
students are evaluated based on 
their adherence to traditional 
beauty standards, representing 
the prevalence of the male 
gaze in college sports culture 
and implying those who don’t 
meet 
their 
standards 
are 
not welcome. Their ethos of 
“Saturdays are for the boys” is 
a summation of real, dangerous 
attitudes about who does and 
who doesn’t belong on gameday.
As students at a university 
with 
a 
massive 
presence 
in collegiate athletics, it is 
important 
to 
consider 
the 
impacts these attitudes have 
on 
our 
campus 
community 
and on college sports. This 
isn’t necessarily a mandate to 
boycott Barstool — after all, 
what would we do without 
#GoodBoyFriday? But consider 
calling them out when they use 
their platform to spread hateful, 
demeaning messages. Barstool 
has a significant influence in 
college culture, including on 
our campus — Barstool Blue, 
U-M’s affiliate, has over 50,000 
followers on Instagram and 
another 
33,000 
on 
Twitter. 
By holding these outlets to 
higher standards, we can set 
an example for canceling out 
the aggressive, toxic aspects 
of the fan culture of collegiate 
sports in favor of creating an 
environment 
welcoming 
to 
everyone. While it may seem 
these 
masculine 
ideals 
are 
embedded within the institution 
of sport, they are perpetuated in 
large part by individual actions 
— which means individuals also 
have the capability to combat 
them. It’s almost impossible 
not to root for Michigan — The 
Killers themselves have even 
said so. When we belt out “Mr. 
Brightside,” let’s do it in a place 
where everyone feels welcome to 
join in.

The Booker Prize 2019: Reviews and Predictions

Landing its 50th award ceremony next week, The 
Booker Prize has proven its intention to stick around 
in the literary sphere. It’s a prize that writers and 
readers alike slobber over, and it’s difficult not to. The 
contestant list showcases names that are both golden 
(Atwood, say, or Rushdie) and brand new (Ellman) that 
give readers a vetted reading list, one certain to take a 
few months to conquer. The winner of the prize takes 
home £50,000 and historically has seen their novel sky-
rocket in sales.
This year’s field plays things somewhat safe. 
Controversy bubbled when Margaret Atwood’s 
sequel to “The Handmaid’s Tale” was locked into the 
shortlist before it was even released. Previous winner 
and household name Salman Rushdie has made this 
finalist position, also. At the same time, though, the 

year’s shortlist includes three people of color and four 
women — perhaps its most diverse arena yet. One novel, 
over 1,000 pages in length, strings along as almost 
a single sentence. Another tackles sex work in West 
Asia. Though perhaps prone to mistakes familiar to 
literary prizes, The Booker has proven its competence 
and ability to ride along in the evolving environment of 
literature.
Last year, The Daily Book Review took on the 
shortlist. We were especially struck by the winner, 
Anna Burn’s “Milkman,” and Sally Rooney’s “Normal 
People.” We were less thrilled by otherchallengers. 
This year, we’ve broadened our scope to both the long 
and short lists — 10 of the 13 novels in total — in an 
attempt to evaluate the contenders. We’ve selected two 
winners: one we see as most likely to win, and one that 
we (given a perfect world, or perhaps a different prize) 
wish would win.
Full reviews for each of the books can be found on 
The Michigan Daily website.

THE LONGLIST

PREDICTED PRIZE WINNER: 
Salman Rushdie, ‘Quichotte’

Making the 2019 shortlist, “Quichotte” 
protracts the practice of bold and expansive 
writing that won Salman Rushdie The Booker 
Prize in 1981. Only this time he widens the lens of 
his story even further: Rushdie packs more than 
five stories (quite suitably) side-by-side. While the 
modern variation of “Don Quixote” and tales of 
reality television celebrities can sometimes feel 
jarring and a bit too unrealistic, they never lose 
their effusive, compelling charm. Rushdie tackles 
politics through an indirect frame that still feels 
familiar — absurd scenarios that still manifest in 
a recognizable world — while maintaining tales of 
love and action drowning in enthusiasm.
“Quichotte” is an easy pick for The Booker 
Prize. Its place on the shortlist is certainly well 
earned. Rushdie’s calculated psychosis is chaotic 
enough to check the experimental category, while 
Mr. Rushdie’s namesake and levelheaded themes 
ground the work enough to poise it for customary 
literary praise. 

— John Decker, Daily Book Review Editor

OUR WINNER: Lucy Ellmann, 
‘Ducks, Newburyport’

Sometime in September it seemed like everyone 
was suddenly aware of Lucy Ellmann. Her 
seventh novel, the nearly thousand-page “Ducks, 
Newburyport,” immediately put her on the radar 
of both mainstream magazine writers and my 
bookish friends, who were immediately curious 
about the enormous orange book I was reading. 
Its eyebrow-raising formal experimentation 
and burning focus on a middle-aged woman’s 
internal monologue was enough to get several 
bemused, vaguely admiring articles published 
about it in advance of its release. Is it really that 
long? Is it really just one sentence? It has the 
feeling of importance surrounding it in a way that 
could feel a bit contrived — it’s a novel whose form 
seems to be well-suited for “this is everything” 
headlines. 
The thing is, the book holds up, and a read of it 
makes one aware of how insufficient its press was. 
Ellmann nails the idiosyncratic speech cadences 
of a middle-aged midwesterner, and has a joyous, 
sensual attention to images and sound that makes 
the book’s infinite stream tumble and crackle 
like a cascading river. It’s a reading experience 
that is like no other — jarring and immersive all 
at once. If it seems sometimes like the novel as 
a form has stalled out or retrenched, expending 
itself in 150-page books with dreamy forms and 
no quotation marks, Ellmann makes the case 
for a wholly different approach to the novel, one 
as free-associative and playful as it is incisive, 
political and demanding. Although perhaps too 
left of center and experimental for The Booker 
committee’s pick, “Ducks” is the choice we see as 
— given no restrictions — the fitting winner of the 
2019 prize.

— Emily Yang, Daily Arts Writer

Margaret Atwood, ‘The Testaments’

“The Testaments” has a solid chance at 
winning this year’s Booker Prize. Atwood is a 
seasoned Booker nominee, winning the award 
nearly 20 years ago for her wonderful novel 
“The Blind Assassin,” and her name is easily the 
most recognizable and widely beloved out of all 
the contenders. 
Should it win, though? In my eyes, no. “The 
Testaments,” though creatively imagined and 
compassionately narrated, is mediocre in nearly 
every other respect. Its characters are dull, 
its prose is unremarkable and occasionally 
embarrassing to read and, perhaps most notably, 
it is simply unnecessary. Everything it tries 
to say about the current political climate, the 
status of modern women and the unspeakable 
horrors of the world it constructs is more 
effectively and more movingly expressed in its 
predecessor “The Handmaid’s Tale.” 
“The Handmaid’s Tale” is a fascinating novel 
because of how confined it is, because its scope 
allows for the existence of a fully developed, 
fully human narrator. “The Testaments” 
suffers by straying from this format, developing 
three voices that ultimately aren’t nearly as 
compelling because they aren’t given enough 
room to evolve. The massive scope of the novel 
prevents any of the elements it contains and all 
of the complexities that come with them from 
being explored in the way they deserve to be 
explored: with care and thoroughness. “The 
Testaments” lays the groundwork for three 
potentially Booker-worthy novels, but it itself is 
not one of them.

Elise Godfryd, Daily Arts Writer

Chigozie Obioma, ‘An Orchestra of 
Minorities’

“An Orchestra of Minorities” is an excellent 
addition to the 2019 Booker Prize shortlist. 
The love story set in West Africa and Cyprus 
remixes “The Odyssey” and “Romeo and Juliet” 
with Nigerian Igbo cosmology and modern 
depictions of race and class. It’s worth the 
read if only for Obioma’s meticulously crafted 
echoes: Mundane physical descriptions ring 
with overarching metaphor and the satirical 
narration style rhymes with other critiques of 
the West.
Obioma’s prose is always engaging, if 
sometimes over the top: Readers will complete 
“An Orchestra” with enough descriptions 
of the characters’ body parts that the 
symbolism begins to crumble. But, the brilliant 
commentary on the shortcomings of empathy 
and love make “An Orchestra” a great read.
Whether it has the experimental chops to fit 
in with past Booker Prize winners is another 
matter. Even if the innovative point of view 
doesn’t push Obioma’s book far enough, the 
book’s Kubrick-like attention to detail at every 
level makes it a must-read for 2019. 

— Lukas Taylor, Daily Arts Writer

Elif Shafak, ‘10 Minutes and 37 
Seconds in this Strange World’

Shafak’s “10 Minutes and 38 Seconds in 
this Strange World” opens with the death of 
Tequila Lelia. With each minute, we follow the 
trajectory of her life. We watch as Leila develops 
from a naive adolescent into a more cautious and 
disillusioned adult, carefully chronicling the 
exact events that eventually lead to her lifestyle 
as an Istanbul sex worker. 
“10 Minutes” goes beyond the typical 
coming-of-age novel. Readers are forced to 
ruminate deeply about the horrors that Lelia 
faced. It’s true that some things may have 
progressed since the mid-20th century, but 
there’s still a pervasive air of exploitation that’s 
evident today. It’s a call to action against the 
oppressive patriarchy. While Shafak is a master 
at flowery prose, the style somewhat distracts 
from the harsh life that Lelia endured. For its 
particular attention to the history, culture, 
beautiful imagery and challenging narrative, “10 
Minutes and 38 Seconds in this Strange World” 
certainly deserves to be on The Booker shortlist. 
Nonetheless, its execution in the portrayals of 
Lelia’s life could’ve been handled better. Instead 
of feeling Lelia’s plight, it’s easy to dwell on the 
romanticized aspects of the book.

The Shortlist

COURTESY OF JOHN DECKER

The Longlist

John Lanchester, ‘The Wall’

What previous shortlister John Lanchester writes 
in “The Wall” is an effective standard-tier novel and a 
less effective evaluation of climate change. The post-
environmental catastrophe book envisions a future 
United Kingdom in which an entire world of climate 
refugees are blocked from entering the country by 
way of a 10,000 kilometer-long wall. Kavanagh, the 
story’s central guard, lathers readers with a colloquial 
but refreshing command of language that depicts 
the wall, the society it protects and those it protects 
society from. When things go south, Kavanagh and 
his love interest are forced off the island and into the 
rising seas.
“The Wall” is enticing, but by the final pages leaves 
only the impression of a standard young adult page-
turner — exciting, but without much more substance 
to comprehend. Perhaps most disappointing is 
the potential for climate commentary Lanchester 
envisions but never completes in more than a general 
sense. In the same tier of “My Sister, the Serial 
Killer,” the work is stirring and well-written, but 
not breathtaking. Despite its imperfections, “The 
Wall” is perhaps the fastest read on the longlist and 
increasingly relevant.

— John Decker, Daily Book Review Editor

Oyinkan Braithwaite, ‘My Sister, the 
Serial Killer’

The second longlisted book to be set in Nigeria, 
“My Sister” holds its ground as an enticing thriller. 
The story circles Korede, a nurse who spends her time 
quite naturally: attending to family matters, falling 
hopelessly for a doctor at the hospital she works at 
and cleaning up after her sister, Ayoola, when she kills 
men. Things disintegrate expectedly when Ayoola 
begins dating the doctor Korede is interested in, and 
her habit of slaying men threatens everything Korede 
knows intimately.

Braithwaite’s debut is seeped in flashback scenes 
and jolting moments of dread that make it obvious 
why the novel has sold quite well. But its flat prose 
and inability to handle consistent themes hinder its 
ability to compete with more traditional novels. This, 
in part, is certainly due to the restrictions the thriller 
medium imposes on Briathwaite’s writing. There are 
merits to “My Sister” in its own right. The novel raises 
important questions and retains readers’ attention. 
But there is little surprise that it didn’t reach high 
enough to hurdle to the shortlist, or for that matter, 
win the final prize. 

— John Decker, Daily Book Review Editor

Kevin Barry, ‘Night Boat to Tangier’

“Night Boat to Tangier” by Kevin Barry is 
undeniably worthy of a recommendation to any fan of 
fiction. That said, The Booker Prize is designated for 
books that approach perfection, so a fairly enjoyable 
book unfortunately does not get past the longlist. 
Still, the longlist is a suitable home to Barry’s 
new novel. Barry deserves immense praise for his 
surreal ability to take on the voice of career criminals. 
The manner in which he evokes empathy from 
the despicable owners of these voices is equally 
commendable. The novel depicts an aggressive drug 
smuggler, well past his prime, as he waits for his long 

estranged daughter in a decrepit port as she may 
or may not be on a boat arriving from Tangier. The 
scenes in the port are nearly flawless, and the rapid-
fire conversations between Maurice and his longtime 
partner in crime, Charlie, carry an authenticity 
and tempo that cannot be paralleled. However, the 
flashbacks, which make up the majority of the novel, 
do not even come close to this caliber. At times they 
function more as commercial breaks, with the reader 
dying to get back to the port. 

— Andrew Pluta, Daily Arts Writer

Deborah Levy, ‘The Man Who Saw 
Everything’

“The Man Who Saw Everything” isn’t up for the 
big prize in this year’s Booker awards. It still received 
adequate recognition from the judging panel with its 
longlisting, though, so if it wanted to boast “Booker-
nominated” on its cover, it could. This label carries 
weight and garners attention in the literary world 
— neither of which “The Man Who Saw Everything” 
has earned. And that, in and of itself, is a problem.
Levy’s book is an exercise in how long an author 
can withhold crucial information and clarity from the 
reader without sending them packing. Readers would 
be advised to hit the road before turning a single 
page. Levy’s indecision and, frankly, laziness lower 
the bar in terms of what readers may expect from 
writers, and squanders the trust more vigilant authors 
prioritize and strive for.
Yet this is Deborah Levy’s third Booker 
nomination. She made the shortlist in both 2012 
and 2016, for “Swimming Home” and “Hot Milk,” 
respectively. I can’t speak to the quality of Levy’s 
other books, but I can postulate that her record 
is what put this lackluster work on the selection 
committee’s radar this year. I shake my head at 
establishment politics taking root in institutions 
meant to honor literature, despite its beautiful 
capacity for bucking establishments.
I’ll overlook the “Booker-nominee” sticker I’ll see 
on copies of Levy’s book, with the hope that more 
deserving books will take the place of establishment 
writers in future years.

— Julianna Morano, Daily Arts Writer
 

Max Porter, ‘Lanny’

When I got through the first 50 pages of “Lanny,” I 
cancelled my plans for the night. It’s the sort of book 
that possesses you — actually, it’s the sort of book you 
enjoy submitting yourself to being possessed by. I 
read it on the Saturday night of Welcome Week over 
a couple beers on my porch, pausing every so often to 
talk to the toga people milling about the street.
The lazy fragmentation of this reading experience, 
in retrospect, paired well with the book’s whimsical 
boundary-pushing. “Lanny” describes a stressful, 
familiar plot — the disappearance of a child — 
by moving playfully between subjectivity and 
omniscience, fact and fable, poetry and theater. 
And its words physically twirl out of line and into 
the margins, as if the text itself is intoxicated by its 
freedom from format.
“Lanny” has a lot of projects going on here, which 
probably would have bothered me if I hadn’t read the 
whole thing in one go. But when steeped completely 
in the space between its overlapping experiments, 
this book does something amazing to the fine lines 
between truth and fiction. I believe I have been 
permanently muddled by Max Porter. It’s amazing.
But Max Porter’s “Lanny” has no chance of 
taking The Booker Prize this year. It’s not anything 
to do with quality — in fact, “Lanny” is the most 
wonderfully afflicting new fiction I’ve read this year. 
I think it’s because “Lanny” didn’t make the shortlist, 
and I think that is because the foundation has hit 
their ceiling for weird. The Booker foundation has 
steadfastly selected long, lush prose novels year after 
year, and this year’s shortlist seems to be largely 
reaped from the pool of preexisting Booker honeys. In 
contrast, longlisted subversives and newbies, like Nick 
Drnaso’s 2018 graphic novel “Sabrina,” look like token 
nods of respect rather than serious considerations.

Netflix’s new superhero series “Raising Dion” 
sits in the middle of a bizarre spectrum with 
Nickelodeon on one end and “Luke Cage” on the 
other. While it has some strengths, the overall 
production quality makes it an overall less-
than-satisfying watch, which is a shame since 
a more talented director could have extracted a 
lot more out of the promising premise.
“Raising Dion” centers around the titular 
seven year old (Ja’Siah Young, debut role) 
and his mother Nicole (Alisha Wainwright, 
“Shadowhunter”), recently widowed after the 
death of her scientist husband Mark (Michael B. 
Jordan, “Creed II”). Dion, a bright and energetic 
child, discovers he has a range of superpowers 
that he has trouble controlling, much to the 
disbelief of his mother. The pair have to discover 
how to manage these newfound and dangerous 
skills, as well as navigate the immediate 
aftermath of tragedy, the insidious presence 
of casual racism and other harmful social 
dynamics in Dion’s school and beyond.
To their credit, the two leads provide as much 
as they can from the substandard script they’re 
given. Their dynamic is tender and believable. 
While shared grief over Mark’s death is one 
of the backbones of their relationship, Dion is 
understandably presented as not quite being 
able to fully understand the ramifications of 
the tragedy. Wainwright’s portrayal of Nicole’s 
constant struggle between carrying on with her 
life and being a supportive mother while not 
being able to let go of the memories of her late 
husband is by far the best acting on the show.
However, these bright spots are let down by 
the fact that the production makes the show 

feel like a Lifetime 
soap. 
From 
the 
subpar 
soundtrack 
to 
the 
cheesy 
flashbacks (with the 
Michael B. Jordan 
cameos), 
there’s 
never a sense of true 
emotional 
weight, 
which 
cheapens 
and 
practically 
neutralizes the supposed impact of Mark’s 
death. It is true that not every superhero series 
needs to be “dark” and “gritty” as so many are 
today, but writers should also strive for tonal 
consistency.
There’s just nothing really new here. Even 
for someone who is by no means a superhero/
comic book series aficionado, the core elements 

of this plot are too 
familiar. There’s no 
risk, no innovation 
in 
any 
aspect 
of 
the production and 
no 
real 
grappling 
with 
the 
social 
issues 
it 
presents 
beyond a superficial 
presentation of them.
Recently, I’ve come 
to expect mediocrity from Netflix originals, 
but I still can’t pin down why. Are these shows 
really contributing enough to their bottom line 
that they can abandon any sort of creativity? 
“Raising Dion” suggests yes. It’s the most 
frustrating type of work, and the sheer “bleh” 
reaction it warrants makes you truly regret the 
valuable time you spent watching it. 

Jordan can’t save ‘Raising Dion’

TV REVIEW

Ghouls and goblins, it’s Halloween. I’m going 
to go ahead and assume that a good half of the 
people reading this column also happen to have 
at the very least been sent a gays on Halloween 
meme from @best_of_grindr on Instagram (we 
share a demographic or two), but Halloween 
is historically and stereotypically a fairly 
big stink in the gay community. The last two 
weeks of October are really the only time of the 
year where you can get away with throwing a 
costume party. For many, they also offer up a 
few rare opportunities to “feel the fantasy,” so 
to speak — cosplaying, referencing, realizing 
whatever vision you have for yourself, doing 
the absolute most while wearing the absolute 
least — whether that means getting into full 
drag or slapping on a harness with a pair of 
booty shorts and calling it a night. 
In his 2018 essay collection “How to Write 
an Autobiographical Novel,” Alexander Chee 
recounts getting into drag for the first time 
on Halloween sometime in his early 20s. He 
realized during the process that not only could 
he “pass” as a woman, but that he felt beautiful 
and at home in his skin in a way that he hadn’t 
before. As with all of the essays in that book, 
Chee seems to effortlessly communicate all of 
the factors that work into its general narrative, 
so any brief recapitulation of his work is 
reductive at best (the chapter was about what 
it means to “pass” in respect to both race and 
gender, as well as the simultaneous feelings of 
power and peril that come with being a target 
of the male gaze), but it’s only fitting that a 
cultural free-for-all like Halloween gave Chee 
and his then-boyfriend the keys to experience 
themselves through a different lens. 

Communities 
that 
are 
subject 
to 
discrimination have a tendency to turn on 
themselves in ways that run parallel to their 
oppressors, but that’s not news. In Paulo 
Friere’s “Pedagogy of the Oppressed,” he 
argues that “the behavior of the oppressed 
is a prescribed behavior, following as it does 
the guidelines of the oppressor.” Infighting 

in the gay community over what’s considered 
attractive and what expressions are acceptable 
is rampant, even if it doesn’t always feel that 
way. Nobody hates gay people more than gay 
people, and you can’t hate a person with the 
same level of efficacy and ruinousness as they 
can themselves. 

What you end up seeing are segmented 
groups within the larger community of men 
who all look the same and act the same. You 
get tiny little bleach blonde microcosms that 
cling to any shred of normative masculinity 
they see in themselves, using it as a leverage 
point over anyone who dares to venture outside 
of the agreed-upon vernacular. And that can 
take on any shape — jockiness, fashion but 
not that kind of fashion, drag but not weird 
drag, leftist intellectualism that’s too evolved 
to listen to Ariana Grande unironically or 
without drafting up a verbal think piece about 
how formulaic expressions of femininity are 
rainbow capitalism. You get rich white gays 
that use their primordial, Luciferian fall 
from the privilege they feel entitled to as an 
excuse for abject bigotry. It’s a mess out there; 
I should know. Consciously or not, we cling 
to the privileges that we have as a means of 
protection against the straight, rich, white and 
cis-gendered, and in doing so wind up doing the 
dirty work for them. 
This is precisely why Halloween has the 
power that it does. Not to say that normalizing 
functions cease entirely, or that everybody 
ceases to exist in a sociopolitical shit smoothie 
that strongly encourages the self-censorship 
and queer sectarianism that I so roughly 
outlined, but in it lies a hope for something 
else. It’s an idea, a chance to escape oneself 
or better yet, delve a little deeper into what it 
is that we really want. No, I’m not referring 
to going sexy carrot full-time, but a space in 
which we can be a sexy carrot and have it not 
invoke a debilitating sense of fear. We could 
all be the person that gets to screech along to 
“God is a woman,” or be the weird drag queen 
or just be able to live without feeling the call 
to answer for it. Self-discovery doesn’t happen 
outside of spaces where you’re given the license 
to do so. That might be Oct. 31, that might be on 
drag night at a local bar, that might be in your 
bedroom. But if we can walk around a public 
setting in a cropped sweater set and miniskirt 
as Buffy the Vampire Slayer, then we can only 
hope to take a little bit of that energy to our day 
to day lives.

Velveteen Dreams: living

TURN OFF THE 
LIGHT

Kim Petras

BunHeads

Kim Petras’s TURN OFF THE LIGHT is 
the answer to all your spooky season playlist 
anxieties — that’s right, you don’t need to listen 
to “Monster Mash” on repeat all October. An 
expansion of her 2018 Halloween-themed EP, 
Turn off the Light, Vol. 1, listening to these 
17 tracks feels like a heart-racing stumble 
through a haunted house. Complete with creaky 
doors, whispers, autotune and heavy dance 
beats, TURN OFF THE LIGHT plays like the 
soundtrack to the glossiest of nightmares. 
The 
album’s 
instrumental 
opener, 
“Purgatory,” ushers listeners in past ominous 
iron gates and gray skies, with piano notes that 
fade into EDM. The feeling that something 
very strange is about to happen is confirmed on 
“There Will Be Blood,” where Petras lays out 
the album’s thematic landscape — blood, death 
and twisted relationships. It’s blatantly clear 
that it’s about to get gory, but it’s so fun to sing 
“You’re gonna die” along with Petras that you 
don’t really mind.
The brooding track “Massacre,” borrows the 
Christmasy melody of “Carol of the Bells” and 
twists its iconic cheery trills into something 
sinister. Following the lyrics, “I’ll take you there 
/ Just you and me / Can’t even breathe / Can’t 
hear you scream,” the “la la las” taunt, covering 
up her captive’s pain. And the transition from 
the song’s outro — the sound of knives being 
sharpened — into the next song, “Knives,” is 
eerily seamless. The listener isn’t given time to 
relax at any point in this album, and it replicates 
the feeling of being chased further into a haunted 
house. The sounds of other rooms linger, but the 
house keeps pushing you in deeper. 
Still, Petras does allow for some palate-
cleansing with songs like “Death by Sex.” 
With not-so-foreboding instrumentation and 
the smirking repetition of “sex, sex, sex,” her 
warning that “you’re never gonna make it out 
alive” isn’t quite so menacing. The opener to 
Turn Off the Light, Vol. 1 called “o m e n” follows, 
functioning as an interlude that sucks you back 
in. “Death by Sex” may have killed you, but this 
listening experience doesn’t end when you’re 
dead. 

The title track, “Turn Off the Light (feat. 
Elvira, Mistress of the Dark),” calls back to 
Vincent Price’s iconic spoken role in “Thriller.” 
But instead of describing “the funk of 40 

thousand years,” Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, 
gives advice. “Only in the darkness will you find 
your true self,” she whispers, highlighting the 
queer perspective Petras brings to Halloween. 
This standpoint is most explicit in the song 
“TRANSylvania,” which is both a clever pun 
and club-ready dance number. 
“Tell Me It’s a Nightmare” is a refreshingly 
real take on fear in which Petras worries about 
her lover’s commitment. She still kills them in 
the end, but it’s easy to mistake her insistence 
that she, “tried to save ya, warn ya, keep you 
alive,” as a not so intense conversation about 
saving their relationship instead.
The album closer, “Everybody Dies,” is the 
song for the end of the haunted house, when 
you’ve pushed open the exit into the cool night 
air and fall back into reality. It’s haunting in 
its sincerity. “Not everybody lives,” warns 
Petras, “but everybody dies.” Contextualizing 
all the twists and turns that came before it, 
Petras knows that the scariest thing isn’t blood, 
demons or dying, but not fully living. 
The album gets repetitive. Blood splatters 
seem to stain every verse and death lurks in 
every chorus. But it’s absolutely dance-party-
ready. There’s something so satisfying about 
Petras’s sugary voice narrating a demon haunt 
— it’s like Halloween candy.

Kim Petras is demanding
we turn off the light, again

What it takes to win a championship
M

el Pearson woke up Fri-
day morning reeling from 
a vivid dream.
It was a sight. The team and him, 
standing in Little Caesars Arena, 
hosting a trophy for all to see.
“I had a dream that we won 
the national 
championship 
in Detroit in 
front of 22,000 
Michigan fans,” 
Pearson said, 
“and how unbe-
lievable that 
would be, and 
how awesome 
it was.”
But dreaming is not a new con-
cept for Pearson. Becoming the head 
coach of Michigan Tech. Winning 
a championship with the Huskies. 
Coming back to coach the Michigan 
hockey team.
And he did just that.
Pearson went out and became 
a six-year head coach at Michigan 
Tech. He won a Western Collegiate 
Hockey Association and WCHA 
Tournament title. And he came back 
and became the eighth head coach in 
Michigan history.
Pearson knows better than 
anyone that it takes more than just 
wishful thinking to make a dream a 
reality. When asked last year, former 
player Quinn Hughes made sure to 
emphasize the process it takes to 
win a national championship.
“At the end of the day, as much as 
we talked about winning a national 
championship, you gotta think day 
to day,” Hughes said. “You can’t win 
a national championship today. It’s 
going to take six, seven months.”
And it’s true. You can’t build a 
national championship-winning 
team overnight. No one regular-
season game will make or break the 
team. It’s a long process that spans 
months, and it’s contingent on a lot 
of multiple different factors. Pear-
son, having been there before when 
he assisted Red Berenson in winning 
two titles, knows exactly what it 
takes to get there. 
He broke it down, and here’s what 
it takes to win it all.
Luck
Luck is a large part of the winning 
equation no one likes to mention. 
Partly because it’s hard to measure, 
and partly because it detracts from 
the result. But it is a factor.
Especially in a game like hockey, 
where there can be so many lucky 
bounces that decide a game, or lucky 
puck placements that swing momen-

tum. You can see it during broken 
plays, like in Sunday’s exhibition 
against Windsor, when freshman 
defenseman Cam York tripped over 
himself and lost the puck in the 
defensive zone — a turnover that led 
directly to a Windsor goal. All he 
could describe it as was, “fluky.”
But the type of luck, or lack 
thereof, that the Wolverines strug-
gled with most of all over the last 
two seasons was keeping everyone 
healthy.
In the 2017-18 season, the season 
Michigan made an unexpected 
Frozen Four run, Will Lockwood 
was forced to sit the second half of 
the season after obtaining a shoul-
der injury at World Juniors. As a 
high-impact player until that point, 
his absence hurt — even though 
the team made a deep run. Senior 
forward Jake Slaker believes if Lock-
wood was healthy, a national cham-
pionship was a serious possibility.
The following year, a similar inju-
ry occurred, again, at World Juniors. 
This time, it was then-sophomore 
forward Josh Norris who was forced 
to sit due to a shoulder injury — at 
the time, leading the team in points. 
Additionally, then-junior defense-
man Luke Martin broke his arm 
against Michigan State.
Injuries are a topic that not too 
many players like to linger on.
Even Lockwood was skeptical to 
talk about his return to full health, 
knocking on wood to ward off any 
chance of jinxing it.
But again, you have to be some-
what lucky to have a fully healthy 
team. The season spans seven 
months. With all the physicality and 
wear-and-tear of hockey, it’s hard to 
predict who catches the injury bug 
and who doesn’t.
“I know it’s the next man up,” 
Pearson said. “But sometimes you 
just can’t overcome that.”
Growth
And part of staying healthy plays 
into growth. You can’t grow as a 
player if you’re sitting on the side-
lines, nursing an injury.
But you also can’t expect to have 
success if your players aren’t playing 
up to par. Pearson believes all the 
pieces of a championship team are 
there. Now the problem is just get-
ting the pieces to fall into place.
“We have everything we need to 
have a chance,” Pearson said. 
But he continued to stress the 
importance of his players’ growth 
as a key component of reaching 
championship potential. With the 
veterans, it’s easy to tell what you 

have or what you will eventually get. 
With the younger players with big 
roles, you’re betting a lot on where 
you think they’ll end up.
“Even Beecher and York, as high 
as they’re rated and everything like 
that, it’s a grind in the college hockey 
season,” Pearson said. “And you 
gotta make sure they continue to get 
better.
“But I believe your best players 
need a lot of coaching too, you just 
can’t ignore them.”
Trying to foster a competitive 
environment, the team has the type 
of depth where not every player 
will get to play, even if they deserve 
so. The cutthroat competition will 
inspire each player to work harder in 
practice, stay longer, be better.
And part of the process is going 
through Michigan’s tough non-
conference schedule. Pearson’s been 
asked if he really wanted to start 
off the season having to face such 
loaded teams. But he wouldn’t have 
it any other way.
He believes it’s a measuring stick. 
One that shows where you are, and 
an indicator for where you need to 
go.
Accountability
To Pearson, it doesn’t matter what 
your role is. You can be a top-line 
forward, a top-pairing defense-
man or the last player on the list of 
undressed players. 
But the players have to show up 
every day or be held accountable.
“If you show up and have a lousy 
practice or a lousy week, you’re let-
ting your teammates down,” Pear-
son said. “You have to make sure you 
come and bring it every day. I don’t 
care if your our best player or maybe 
our 17th forward on the depth chart, 

you have something to come and 
push guys every day.”
Games will be lost. It’s inevitable 
unless a miracle occurs. But the abil-
ity to understand what went wrong, 
accept it and move on is what makes 
good teams great.
Last year, when Quinn Hughes 
committed two turnovers that lead 
directly to opposing goals against 
Penn State January 26, he pointed 
to himself and claimed responsibil-
ity. It was the first time all season he 
had publicly declared his faults, and 
the team, soon after, found any sem-
blance of success — winning three of 
their next four games and losing the 
fourth by one.
“I think that’s the biggest thing is 
you have to have the accountability 
and that consistency on a day to 
day, week to week, month to month 
regardless of how the games are 
going,” Pearson said.
Heart
You hear it all the time. You have 
to want it, to get it.
Last year, Hughes talked about 
how the team discussed the pros-
pects of a national title, but that his 
decision to come back ultimately put 
himself first, making sure he was 
ready for the pros. The team last 
year had individuals that put them-
selves above all else, and it showed. 
And all the preseason hype, the 
top-five national ranking, the high 
expectations, was for naught as the 
team disappointed, finishing with a 
sub-.500 record.
And the players, this year, took 
last season to heart.
Lockwood couldn’t even think 
about making a decision on whether 
to return or not after the season-
ending loss to Minnesota. And when 

the time came around to decide, he 
listened to his heart.
“My heart was always here,” 
Lockwood said. “And it’s kind of 
hard to turn down decision of some-
thing you dreamt of your whole life, 
but my heart has always been at 
(Michigan). Been in Ann Arbor.”
The team heard the criticism and 
kept it in the back of their minds. 
They had goals, ones they weren’t 
willing to share. But their expecta-
tions of what the team would be was 
important to them. And to make 
whatever they had in mind happen, 
every individual has to buy in. No 
one around the locker room cared 
where the other was from, where 
they were drafted, how touted they 
were.
“I can stand you up and measure 
how tall you are,” Pearson said. 
“And I can put you on the scale and 
measure what you weigh but a lot 
of times, you can’t measure a guy’s 
heart.”
***
If it was as easy as to just have 
those factors, every team would 
have a chance to win. But Pearson 
believes it doesn’t take the best team 
to win. It just takes playing the best, 
on any given night.
So when Pearson recalled a 
Thursday night’s sleep, he saw his 
team, maybe not the best in the field, 
but the one that played the best. 
“You always dream about things. 
What you want. What’re you trying 
to achieve.” Pearson said. “Maybe 
it’s a dream, but dreams do come 
true.”

ALEXANDRIA POMPEI/Daily
Michigan coach Mel Pearson had surprising success in his first season in Ann Arbor, but struggled in his second.

TIEN LE


Will Lockwood says his dad 
never told him much about his 
history at Michigan.
It’s hard to believe, given the 
kind of history Joe Lockwood 
made. As a freshman in January 
1985, the first season of the Red 
Berenson era, Joe scored one of 
the most unexpected, historic 
goals ever to find twine at Yost 
Ice Arena. 
Berenson didn’t have any expec-
tations that his team, his group 
that had lost 9-0 to Ferris State 
the previous night, would even 
be able to play closely with the 
professional Russian team, Spar-
tak Moscow, let alone beat them.
The fans filling Yost didn’t have 
any expectations, either. They 
knew the Michigan hockey 
team was having a rough start to 
Berenson’s first season, but they 
were excited to see the Russians 
play their team — especially at a 
time in American history when 
beating the Russians meant more 
than almost anything.
Even the players, most of whom 
had marched down to athletic 
director Don Canham’s office the 
previous year to air their griev-
ances about the coaching staff 
and petition John Giordano’s 
firing, didn’t have much of a hope 
that they’d win.
“You’re just hoping you can stay 
in the game, quite literally,” Joe 
said. “We were excited for the 
game. It was a fun game to play in 
but having come off of a road trip 
back from Ferris with that — it 
was a devastating weekend.”

And Spartak, which came over to 
play a series of exhibition match-
es against U.S. colleges, was 
expecting a light, easy win over a 
historic program that was strug-
gling to find its footing in a new 
era. Giordano had been the one 
to agree to the game, so Berenson 
had no idea what he was getting 
himself and his team into.
When Berenson learned that 
Spartak had come to the U.S. to 
play three schools — Michigan, 
Wisconsin and Minnesota — and 
it had already beaten the other 
two, he knew his team was in 
trouble. 
Spartak had a day off in Ann 
Arbor to wait for the Wolverines, 
who were across the state in Big 
Rapids. The three-hour bus ride 
back home, where the Russians 
waited was always going to be 
long — especially after losing by 
nine goals on Saturday. Then the 
bus broke down, and a long night 
got even longer.
“We finally got home sometime 
in the middle of the night and 
the next night, we had to play 
the Russians at home,” Berenson 
said. “I was really down about 
how we had played at Ferris last 
night. Give the players credit, I 
mean, they bounced back and 
they were fired up.”
As the game got underway, it 
became clear Spartak wasn’t 
going to run away with it, as pre-
viously assumed. Michigan came 
ready to play, and the Wolverines 
weren’t going down without a 
fight.
“We stayed in the game and there 
were some big turning points in 
the game,” Berenson said. “One 
of them, I’ll never forget. We had 

a big hit from Mike Neff, he hit 
one of the Russians — like real-
ly hit him — at center ice. That 
seemed to jump start our team a 
little bit and the crowd.”
The crowd — mostly made up 
of local Ann Arborites because 
the students were still on winter 
break — provided a lift of energy 
to the team. And with it, Mich-
igan provided a lift of energy 
right back with every save from 
goaltender Mark Chiamp, every 
hit and every goal.
“The Russians seemed like 
they were just playing with us,” 
Berenson said. “They knew they 
could beat us. Mark Chiamp was 
standing on his head. ... If the 
puck missed him, it hit the post 
or the crossbar, and it stayed out.”
Added Joe: “They definitely took 
us very lightly, and that didn’t 
work out so well for them.”
A game that was expected to be 
an easy win for Spartak turned 
into a raucous, back-and-forth 
affair. 
With 30 seconds left, the game 
was tied at four goals apiece. 
Defenseman Doug May blocked 
a shot at the blueline, and Joe 
pounced on the rebound. A quick 
glance up revealed open ice in 
front of him — the kind of break-
away at a key moment of the 
game that every hockey player 
dreams of.
Nearly 35 years later, Berenson 
and Lockwood still remember 
almost every detail of the goal 
that lifted a struggling American 
college team over an all-star 
Russian team in the depths of the 
Cold War.
“(Joe) knew he only had one 
move, but he knew the Russians 

wouldn’t know what it was,” Ber-
enson said. “He fired that puck 
in the top corner like he’d done 
it a thousand times and the place 
went nuts.”
***
If this were a movie, Joe Lock-
wood’s story would continue 
with him becoming a star for the 
Wolverines and having a long 
NHL career, all sparked by that 
one goal to beat the Russians. 
While this isn’t a movie, as the 
years go on, the story of the 
Lockwood family and Michigan 
hockey comes closer than most 
do. 
Throughout their time at Mich-
igan, Joe was good friends with 
Gordie Berenson — Red’s son. 
After graduation, he stayed in the 
area, and the relationship with 
the Berenson family grew.
Joe and Gordie have remained 
friends for decades, through 
the transitions of becoming 
full-fledged adults and starting 
families. When Joe’s eldest son, 
Will, was born in 1998, it was 
only a matter of time before the 
next generations of the Berenson 
and Lockwood families forged 
a bond.
Having grown up in a Michigan 
family himself — both of Joe’s 
parents attended the University 
— Joe wanted to raise his chil-
dren as fans of the Wolverines. 
They didn’t go to many hockey 
games at first, but as Gordie’s son, 
Blake, and Will got older, they 
became regulars around the rinks 
where Michigan was playing. It 
was there that the seeds were 
planted in Will.
“We would go to the games 
together all the time with our 

dads,” Will said. “We started go-
ing around (age) eight or nine, so 
that’s kind of where it started.”
Throughout Will’s childhood, 
Joe introduced his son to 
elements of his own youth — 
everything from taking the kids 
to Michigan hockey games to 
building a rink in the backyard 
because that’s what Joe’s father 
always did.
This led to Will first lacing up a 
pair of skates at only three years 
old. From the beginning, there 
were signs that hockey might be 
in his future.
“My dad used to put out the 
wood panels and a big sheet of 
(plastic) and fill it up with water,” 
Joe said. “There was a kid in 
our neighborhood whose dad 
also did that, and we’d have little 
home and away games. It was 
really cool, so I thought, ‘For sure 
I’m building a rink when I have 
kids.’ I love it. … (Will) was three 
years old and we had a little rink 
in the backyard. He just took to 
it right away. His other siblings 
would skate too, but he took to it 
very naturally.”
Will says Joe never pushed 
him to play and never forced 
anything, but it’s clear that the 
younger Lockwood wanted to be 
just like his dad.
When Will started to play 
organized hockey, Joe coached 
him for the first few years. But 
as soon as things started to get 
serious, Joe realized that Will 
would be better off without his 
dad being the typical overbearing 
sports parent.
“I didn’t want to get in his way,” 
Joe said. “I didn’t want to coach 
him. I didn’t want there to be the

friction between (us), being too 
hard on him. I just felt he would 
be better off without me coaching 
him. Just to be a good dad, as 
opposed to a dad/coach, guy who 
yells at him on the way home. I 
wanted to let him play it out, and 
he did it. He stepped up.”
Joe never played in the NHL, 
but by age 15, his son caught the 
attention of the coaches at the 
U.S. National Team Development 
Program. Neither Will nor his 
father expected the invitation, 
much less the phone call that said 
Will had made the team. But he 
did, cementing himself as one of 
the top juniors in the country.
“He did not want to play on that 
team if he was going to be one of 
the kids that was going to be not 
used as much,” Joe said. “He was 
reluctant to sign up with them for 
that reason.”
As it turned out, Will’s two years 
at the NTDP were spent with 
players like Clayton Keller, now 
entering his third NHL season, 
and Adam Fox, who is now with 
the New York Rangers. While 
Keller led the team with 107 
points in 62 games and was a 
headliner on a deep team, Will 
also made his mark.
His 33 points in 59 games 
finished sixth on the team, and 
after his U18 year, the Vancouver 
Canucks selected him in the third 
round of the 2016 NHL Draft.
After being unsure if he would 
have a role at the NTDP and 
getting a push from his dad to 
join the team, Will played his way 
onto the cusp of everything he’d 
ever wanted.
“My philosophy with him is 
always just go where you’re 

wanted,” Joe said. “Go where 
you’re wanted, because you don’t 
want to go play with a team just 
chasing a trophy. If the coach 
doesn’t like you, you’re not gonna 
be a large part of it. I think he’s 
adopted that philosophy and it’s 
served him pretty well.”
The gamble Will took on joining 
the NTDP paid off. He went 
where he was wanted, and it took 
him to where he always wanted 
to be.
***
In the sixth grade, Will’s teacher 
asked him and his classmates to 
write letters to themselves in 10 
years. One of the questions to 
answer was, if you could have a 
dream come true, what would 
it be?
To Will, the answer was simple.
“I want to play hockey at the 
University of Michigan on a 
scholarship,” Will wrote. 
A few years later, the first steps 
toward that dream were set in 
motion. Berenson always kept a 
closer eye on Will than he would 
other players because of the 
family relationship, and once Will 
made the NTDP, his recruiting 
process was set in motion.
“It was gratifying to see Will 
make the development team,” 
Berenson said. “I don’t know if 
Joe thought he would make it, 
but it really came down to tryouts 
and measuring players against 
(each other). These are the best 
players for their age in the United 
States, overall, across the country. 
Will held his own with those 
players.
“As soon as we saw that — you 
know, these are the kids we want 
at Michigan. Kids from Michigan, 

kids that really understand what 
Michigan is all about, and in 
particular, a kid whose dad had 
played here.”
When the time came for Will 
to make an official visit to Yost, 
it was all but a formality. He’d 
been around campus and Yost 
his entire life, and he knew that 
Michigan was home. Berenson 
met him outside the doors to 
the rink and took him up to the 
locker room — the one place Will 
hadn’t seen yet.
That was all Will needed to make 
his decision. He committed on 
the spot.
“Red and I both knew,” Will said. 
“We were kind of on the same 
page. I think he wanted me to 
come to school here and for me, it 
was what I always wanted to do, 
so it was a pretty short process.”
And while playing for the Wol-
verines was always Will’s dream, 
neither he, nor Joe, nor Berenson 
ever imagined that he would play 
under the same man that coached 
his father more than 30 years 
prior.
In the 2015-16 season, Michigan 
went 25-8-5 and lost to North 
Dakota in the regional final of 
the NCAA Tournament. It was 
Berenson’s 32nd year behind the 
bench for Michigan, and many 
expected it to be his last. People 
typically want to go out on top, 
and finishing one game shy of the 
Frozen Four is almost as good as 
it gets.
Will was in his last year at the 
NTDP when the Wolverines 
went on that run, and three of 
his teammates — Nick Pastujov, 
Luke Martin and Griffin Luce 
— were committed to Michigan 

as well. None of them knew what 
to expect, but they all held onto 
hope that Berenson would return 
for one more year so they could 
play for the legendary coach.
Defying all expectations, as Ber-
enson is known to do, he decided 
to extend his coaching career just 
a bit longer.
It was the final piece of the puz-
zle to make Will’s wildest dreams 
come true.
“It was pretty special,” Will said. 
“I think we all cherish the year 
we had with Red because he’s 
such a great coach and not just 
a Michigan hockey legend but a 
hockey legend in general. To play 
for him and develop a relation-
ship that my dad and I share was 
special.”
Once Will got on campus, it was 
clear that he was going to make 
an impact right away. He scored 
his first goal in the first game of 
the 2016-17 season, and he had 
two more by the end of October.
Looking back, Berenson thinks 
Will’s love for Michigan is what 
made him successful from day 
one.
“He was an impact player,” Ber-
enson said. “There’s no question. 
When Will Lockwood put the 
Michigan jersey on, he was 10 
feet tall.”
But it wasn’t always so idyllic.
Will’s physical, verging-on-reck-
less play left him dealing with 
recurrent shoulder injuries 
throughout his freshman year. 
In his sophomore season, a solid 
first half was thrown to the side 
when he suffered an injury to 
that same shoulder at the World 
Junior Championships and re-
quired season-ending surgery.

Mentally, spending two of his 
first three years at Michigan 
dealing with injuries weighed 
on him, and coming back from 
surgery took longer than anyone 
expected. Will was healthy for 
the beginning of his junior year, 
but it took half the season before 
he was back to his old self.
But once he returned to form, 
he was one of the Wolverines’ 
most important players, leading 
the team in goals with 16. Will 
heavily considered foregoing his 
senior year and signing with the 
Canucks after his strong junior 
campaign, and he consulted Joe 
about what to do. In the end, as it 
always has, his heart pulled him 
back to Michigan.
At the end of March, he informed 
Vancouver of his decision to 
return for his final year. Three 
weeks later, Will was voted the 
100th captain in Michigan hock-
ey history.
“It kind of took me a little bit to 
soak it in and think about the 
history of Michigan hockey and 
some of the captains that have 
come before me and things like 
that,” Will said. “Once it did, it 
was absolutely surreal. It’s always 
a special thing when you’re voted 
a leader on your team by your 
teammates. It just is a great honor 
to hold.”
Now, 35 years after Joe first 
donned a Michigan hockey 
sweater, Will, who spent his 
childhood idolizing his father, 
will spend one last year with the 
block ‘M’ across his chest.
Their shared name, Lockwood, 
will be on his shoulders, and he’ll 
wear the number 10 on his back.
Just like his dad.

Big Ten Breakdown — ND, PSU, Wisconsin look strong 

ROHAN KUMAR
Daily Sports Writer

If the Michigan hockey team 
hopes to rebound from prior 
struggles, it must fare better in the 
Big Ten. The Wolverines finished 
second to last in the conference 
standings last season and got 
bounced in the first round of the Big 
Ten Tournament.
Early next month, Michigan 
kicks off conference play. A quick 
glance shows that Penn State, Notre 
Dame and Wisconsin appear to lead 
the pack, but it’s hard to measure 
the separation.
To get outside perspectives, The 
Daily reached out to a few alumni 
from 
around 
the 
conference. 
In particular, we talked to Paul 
Caponigri, Jake Evans and Mike 
Ferrantino. 
Caponigri played for Ohio State 
through the 2003-04 season and 
now covers hockey for Big Ten 
Network. Evans played on the 
Notre Dame team that went to the 
2018 National Championship game 
and now plays in the AHL for the 
Laval Rockets. Ferrantino played 
for Michigan State from 2012 to 
2016.
No. 8 Notre Dame
The 
Fighting 
Irish 
have 
dominated since the moment they 
joined the conference two years 
ago. Last season, they claimed 
their second consecutive Big Ten 
Tournament title and finished 
runner-up 
in 
the 
conference 
standings. They also played in the 
last four NCAA Tournaments and 

appear primed for another berth.
With goaltender Cale Morris back 
for his senior year, Notre Dame has 
stability between the pipes. Morris 
was one of 10 finalists for the Hobey 
Baker Award as a sophomore, and 
last season finished eighth in the 
nation with a 0.93 save percentage. 
A few other proven players returned 
for their final years, most notably 
forward Cal Burke. His 12 goals in 
2018-19 tied for most on the team 
with sophomore forward Michael 
Graham.
The departures of defensemen 
Bobby 
Nardella 
and 
Andrew 
Peeke, as well as forward Dylan 
Malmquist, leave big holes, though. 
The trio generated much of the 
offensive production last year, 
leading the team in assists. An 
increased role for the sophomore 
class could help fill that void. Evans 
mentioned the speed of that class 
stood out to him the most.
“I think the freshmen played a 
big part last year,” Evans said. “So 
I think if they take that next step, 
I think they’re going to be a really 
good team.”
No. 12 Ohio State
The 
key 
question 
for 
the 
Buckeyes this season will be filling 
in all of its lost production. They 
topped the conference by a wide 
margin last year and also made the 
Tournament, but lost a crucial piece 
in forward Mason Jobst headed 
into this season. He led his team 
in scoring and was a Hobey Baker 
finalist.
“When you lose a player like a 
Mason Jobst, who was just a really 

good leader, you just have to wonder 
where do you fill that in,” Caponigri 
said. “ … He carried a lot of minutes 
for them, so who’s going to step up?”
Ohio State lost two additional 
contributors in forwards Dakota 
Joshua and Freddy Gerard. The duo 
combined for 44 points. Forward 
Tanner Laczynski and goaltender 
Tommy Nappier are back, though. 
Laczynski was a major part of the 
offense 
alongside 
Jobst, 
while 
Nappier boasted an outstanding 
.934 save percentage. If the two 
are as good as last year and can 
help others get more involved, the 
Buckeyes should be competitive.
“I think that their biggest 
strength 
is 
probably 
their 
structure,” Caponigri said. “They 
can put anybody — not anybody in 
there — but, you know, you can lose 
some high-end players, which they 
have, but they have a really good 
structure.”
No. 13 Penn State
Last season, the Nittany Lions 
wildly underperformed. They got 
hot in the conference tournament 
and reached the championship 
game, but that wasn’t enough. Penn 
State started out ranked fifth in the 
nation, yet finished below .500 in 
conference play and failed to make 
the NCAA Tournament. 
Heading into this season, the 
expectations are high once again. 
The Big Ten preseason poll predicts 
the Nittany Lions will win the 
conference. They return their top-
five scorers from last year’s squad 
that led the nation with 4.54 goals 
per game. 

Also, forward Aarne Talvitie 
could help add to that production. 
Talvitie notched five goals in 
17 games for Penn State before 
sustaining a season-ending injury 
at the World Junior Championships 
while leading the Finnish team to a 
gold medal.
“I think they got it right in terms 
of first place,” Caponigri said. “Penn 
State, on paper right now, because 
you haven’t seen any games or 
anything, they have probably the 
most talent.”
Whether 
the 
team 
meets 
expectations will depend largely 
on the defense. The Nittany Lions 
finished 56th out of 60 teams in 
average goals allowed last season, 
undermining 
all 
the 
offensive 
glamour. 
No. 16 Wisconsin
Now in his fourth season as head 
coach, Tony Granato looks to bring 
the Badgers back to the spotlight. 
Wisconsin 
has 
a 
remarkable 
program, 
historically 
speaking, 
but the last five years have taken a 
different path. 
The Badgers secured just 12 
combined victories the two seasons 
before Granato took over. They 
finished second in the conference 
during his first year, but then 
slumped back to mediocrity. Last 
season, Wisconsin finished fifth in 
the conference and tallied just 14 
wins.
The team should be much better 
this time around, though. Out of 
the seven players who garnered the 
most points last year, six return. 
The Badgers brought in a talented 
freshman class of seven, too. Four 
of them were NHL draft picks — 
including forwards Alex Turcotte 
and Cole Caufield, who were chosen 
at No. 5 and No. 15 overall. Last 
season’s Canadian Junior Hockey 
League Player of the Year and 
projected first-round NHL draft 
pick Dylan Holloway is also part of 
the loaded class, at forward.
But there’s more. Forward Ty 
Pelton-Byce could play a major 
role, too. After sitting out last 
season upon transferring from 
Harvard, Pelton-Byce is ready to 
rock. He excelled in his sophomore 
campaign 
with 
the 
Crimson, 
tallying 25 points. If Pelton-Byce 
and the other newcomers live up 
to the hype — and if goaltending 
improves — Granato could revive 
the program.
Minnesota
It’s hard to know what to expect 
from the Golden Gophers. Last 
season, their power play efficiency 

ranked eighth best in the nation 
and helped them finish third in the 
conference.
That said, Minnesota is without 
forwards Rem Pitlick, Tyler Sheehy 
and Brent Gates Jr., who combined 
for 46 goals and 117 points last 
season. And goaltender Mat Robson 
— who had a stellar .921 save 
percentage last season — left for the 
Minnesota Wild.
Out of the 27 players on the 
current roster, 19 are underclassmen 
— including a freshman class of 11. 
Four of the newcomers were draft 
picks and should contribute early, 
especially defenders Ryan Johnson 
and Jackson LaCombe. Johnson 
was selected No. 31 overall, while 
LaCombe was taken in the second 
round. For the Golden Gophers to 
succeed, the youngsters need to 
step up.
“Minnesota is very young — I 
think they’re the youngest team in 
the country,” Caponigri said. “And 
a lot of times with that, that can be 
exciting, but you don’t know what 
you’re going to get from the guys 
that are coming in, you know, how 
they’re gonna react with a new level 
of hockey.”
Michigan State
Danton Cole enters his third 
season at the helm of the Spartans’ 
program. Those first two runs were 
bumpy, with the team finishing last 
in the conference both times.
The team returns many pieces 
from last season, seeing only three 
seniors graduate. The key gap 
comes from star forward Taro 
Hirose, who forwent his senior 
year to join the Detroit Red Wings. 
Before leaving, he tied for the most 
points in the nation, won Big Ten 
Player of the Year and was a Hobey 
Baker Finalist.
Filling that void will be very 
tough. Players like forward Sam 
Saliba will need to carry more of the 
load. That said, Ferrantino believes 
the 
overall 
limited 
turnover 
heading into this season could help 
bring stability in the program. He 
also thinks that since the new coach 
has had time to settle in, the only 
way to go is up.
“Obviously, you have a lot of 
turnover, a lot of changes of ideas, 
philosophies,” Ferrantino said of 
the coaching change. “So it’s tough 
as a player because you gotta adjust, 
and especially the guys that have 
been there for two or three years. … 
And I think you’ll see that over time 
here, they’ll be able to kind of turn 
things around and get going the 
right direction.”

From goaltenders to forwards, breaking down the ‘M’ roster

There’s only one word to sum 
up Michigan’s 2018-19 season 
— disappointing. Two seasons 
ago, 
Michigan 
was 
moments 
from playing for the national 
championship. But last year, the 
team struggled in every aspect. 
This offseason, the roster suffered 
some shake ups when Quinn 
Hughes and Josh Norris left for 
the NHL.
This season for the Wolverines 
is about bouncing back. It’s about 
proving that two years ago wasn’t 
a fluke occurrence. The team is 
talented and wants to prove it’s 
a force to be reckoned with. The 
return of 19 players from last year’s 
roster is evidence of that hunger. In 
addition to the veterans, there’s a 
five man freshman class, including 
two first round draft picks, Cam 
York and Johnny Beecher. 
But recruits and 
returnees 
aside, 
Michigan’s roster 
has questions that 
need 
addressing 
and 
lines 
need 
to 
rise 
to 
the 
occasion. 
The 
Daily provides an 
in depth look at 
where the answers 
to the questions 
lie, what can be 
expected of the veteran players 
and who could breakout.
GOALTENDING
Last season, the Wolverines 
found themselves plagued by a 
serious goaltending problem.
It wasn’t an issue stemming 
from lack of talent. Sophomore 
Strauss Mann and senior Hayden 
Lavigne have both shown their 
ability in between the pipes. In his 
sophomore season, Lavigne proved 
his talent by leading his team on a 
Frozen Four run. During his 2017-
18 junior hockey season, Mann led 
his team to the USHL Clark Cup.
But last year, none of those 
accomplishments mattered. The 
Wolverines went through the 
entire season without a dependable 
goaltender. The role flip flopped 
between Mann and Lavigne. Often, 
one would start the weekend 
series Friday, only to be swapped 
out for the other on Saturday. 
Lavigne finished the season with a 
.884 save percentage. Mann barely 
edged out Lavigne with .895. Both 
stressed improving their mental 
game during this offseason.

However, 
this 
season, 
the 
absence of a starting netminder 
will be no longer. 
Michigan coach Mel Pearson 
wants a definite starter though 
he hasn’t committed to one yet. 
And right now, the scale tilts in 
favor of Mann. In last week’s 
exhibition against Windsor, he 
played 30 minutes, faced five shots 
and turned them all away. The 
other half of the game belonged 
to Lavigne. Facing 12 shots, he 
turned away 10. 
DEFENDERS
When Michigan’s season ended 
after a first round elimination in 
the Big Ten Tournament, Pearson 
was prepared for the inevitable. 
Quinn Hughes was leaving for 
the 
Vancouver 
Canucks. 
And 
when he left, there’d be a gap in 
the blueline. But the hole will 
likely be unnoticeable courtesy 
of one man — Cam York. Along 
with York, Michigan welcomes 
another promising 
freshman, 
Keaton 
Pehrson. 
With a mixture 
of 
newcomers 
and 
returnees, 
the 
Wolverines 
defense looks to 
find success.
Luke 
Martin-
Cam York
The 
top 
defensive 
pair 
combines York’s two-way play 
with veteran senior Luke Martin’s 
sharp game vision. This duo is 
set to replace last season’s top 
pairing Cecconi-Hughes. Hughes 
and Cecconi largely contributed 
to Michigan’s offense, together 
tallying 45 assists. But Martin and 
York shouldn’t have any issues. 
While Martin isn’t the most 
offensive-minded 
defender, 
he 
adds physicality and experience. 
Last year, when Martin suffered 
a season-ending broken wrist, 
his absence was felt. Healthy, 
and ready for his final season, the 
Wolverine defense is better off 
with his presence.
Last 
season 
with 
the 
United 
States 
National 
Team 
Development Program (USNTDP), 
York set the record for most points 
in a season with 65. And in his 
debut, he gave Wolverine fans 
a taste of the offense he brings 
from the blue line. Scoring two 
goals and finishing the night with 
a plus-2 rating, York was nothing 
short of impressive. His offensive 
gameplay is rooted in passing 

rather than skating the puck 
through center ice like Hughes 
would. With Martin’s defensive-
focused 
style 
complimenting 
York’s 
offensive 
moments, 
Michigan’s top defensive pair will 
likely make a big impact.
Griffin Luce-Keaton Pehrson
The 
second 
defensive 
pair 
mirrors a similar set up to the 
top line — a veteran paired 
with a freshman. Senior Griffin 
Luce is a very defensive focused 
defensemen. That’s why he pairs 
so well with a rookie player like 
Pehrson. Luce’s experience will 
allow Pehrson to make offensive 
zone rushes and trust Luce is 
covering him. Beyond his size and 
strength, Luce proves to be one of 
the team’s best backcheckers. 
Jack 
Su m mers -Nick 
Bla n kenbu rg
Michigan’s 
third 
defensive 
pairing 
features 
returning 
sophomores Jack Summers and 
Nick Blankenburg. Last season, 
Blankenburg finished with a plus-
11 rating — the highest on the 
team. With the level of physicality 
he plays with, it’s hard to believe 
he’s the smallest on the team. His 
quickness will compliments that 
of his linemate’s. The offensive 
outbursts stem from the time 
Blankeburg spent as a forward 
in juniors. Summers had a strong 
finish to last season, earning three 
assists on Feb. 1 last season. His 
physicality could be increased, 
but overall, he provides a stable 
defensive partner for Blankenburg.
The 
Undressed: 
Shane 
Switzer-Jake Gingell
Shane 
Switzer, 
a 
graduate 
transfer from BU, adds another 
veteran presence to the blueline. 
The other remaining defenseman 
is sophomore Gingell. In the 
Wolverines’ 
exhibition 
game, 
Gingell played minutes for the 
first time in his college career. And 
Pearson’s been impressed with 
the work Gingell put in during 
the offseason. He’s leaner. He’s 
quicker. He’s made strides with his 
skating. Should a spot open in one 
of the defensive pairings, it’ll be 
an interesting conversation to see 
which seventh man takes the role.
FORWARDS
Having senior captain Will 
Lockwood back, after declining 
to go pro and join the Canucks, 
is an automatic boost for the 
Wolverine’s offense. Lockwood 
led the team with 16 goals and 
finished second in points with 31. 
In addition, the roster returns two 

other seniors with Jake Slaker and 
Nick Pastujov. The loss of Norris is 
the most notable gap here, playing 
center on the top line with Slaker 
and Lockwood last season. Despite 
a .500 record, Michigan offense 
didn’t sputter. It scored 110 goals, 
only four fewer than allowed. 
Jake Slaker-Jacob Hayhurst-
Will Lockwood
Slaker and Lockwood return for 
one last go. The pair have a lot of 
chemistry, seeing as they’ve played 
together on the same line since 
their sophomore seasons. When 
Lockwood and Slaker are on the 
ice, Michigan is instantly a better 
team. Lockwood’s biggest asset is 
his speed. With Slaker, it’s his shot 
that makes him a standout. Adding 
Jacob 
Hayhurst, 
a 
graduate 
transfer from RPI, to the mix may 
just be the missing piece the pair’s 
been searching for to make the 
jump from great to elite. 
Eric Ciccolini-Nick Pastujov-
Jimmy Lambert
This 
line 
holds 
so 
much 
potential. A lot of it relies on 
sophomore Jimmy Lambert and 
freshman Eric Ciccolini rising 
to the occasion. Through three 
seasons, Pastujov has time and 
time again showed his worth. 
He’s a great puck distributor, a 
talented skater. Among the top 
five point getters on the team. 
Ciccolini, on the other hand, is a 
bit of a question mark. He missed 
the exhibition due to an upper 
body injury. But Pearson likes his 
elusiveness, speed and hockey IQ. 
For Lambert, his freshman season 
was filled with highs and lows. 
His first goal didn’t come until 
the second half of the season on 
Jan. 12. Once it came though, his 
play really picked up. He went on 
to lead all freshmen in points with 

four goals and nine assists. If he 
can keep the momentum from last 
season building, this could be his 
breakout year. 
Michael 
Pastujov-Johnny 
Beecher-Jack Becker
The third line mixes two veteran 
players 
with 
Beecher, 
another 
player from the USNTDP. He was 
drafted 30th overall by the Boston 
Bruins in this year’s draft. On this 
line, what one skater lacks, another 
provides. Pastujov is a skilled puck 
handler who packs a powerful shot. 
Becker adds size and physicality, 
but lacks quickness. He’s the player 
willing to stand in front of the 
net for redirects and tip ins. With 
Beecher, the sky’s his limit. He’s got 
size, strength, speed and a shot. 
Dakota 
Raabe-Garrett 
Van 
Wyhe-Nolan Moyle
This is the Wolverines’ only 
complete 
returning 
line 
from 
last season. Each player brings 
something unique. Raabe hustles, 
relentlessly following the puck as 
it zooms around the ice. Van Wyhe 
is arguably the fastest player on the 
roster. Moyle serves as a big body to 
screen the goalie. Like Becker, he 
hangs around the crease hunting for 
rebounds. Pearson has expressed 
how well he thinks this line works. 
He’s even gone as far as to say he’d 
match them up against any line in 
the NCAA. 
OUTLOOK
The Wolverines have all the 
pieces needed to assemble a team 
that can go deep in the postseason. 
Their biggest challenge is finding a 
consistent goaltender. If wild card 
players like Ciccolini and Hayhurst 
find a rhythm with their lines, the 
goals will come. When, and if, these 
pieces click, Michigan’s senior 
group can take control and lead the 
team far.

Sophomore goaltender Strauss Mann struggled last year but is expected to start in 
net for Michigan this year.

Pearson wants 
a definite 
starting 
goaltender.
