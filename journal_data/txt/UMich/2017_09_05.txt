Information and Technology 

Services at the University of 
Michigan released updates to 
campus computing sites for fall 
2017. The updates are part of an 
initiative to make technology 
more accessible to students on 
more devices, according to a 
University press release.

The updates include Sites 

Windows computer software, 
which will now be available 
through 
AppsAnywhere, 
a 

portal similar to the app store 
that can be accessed via web 
browsers. 
AppsAnywhere 

uses Cloudpaging, the same 
on-demand 
service 
as 
the 

College of Engineering’s CAEN 
Lab Software, which allows 
students to access computer 
software from a web browser 
on different devices, rather 
than a start menu on just one 
computer. 

The MPrint mobile app also 

was revamped, now allowing 
students to use their own mobile 
devices to wirelessly collaborate 
with campus technology. The 
app for iOS and Android devices 
will work with Follow Me print 
queue, a new application for 
campus computers that can save 
documents for up to 24 hours. 
Students 
can 
release 
their 

saved documents to the most 
convenient 
campus 
printing 

site.

University 
of 
Michigan 

students, 
faculty 
and 

community members gathered 
Monday 
afternoon 
at 
the 

University Rock to paint over 
anti-Latinx 
and 
pro-Trump 

writing that happened over the 
weekend. 

The rock read “F— Latinos” 

and 
“MAGA,” 
short 
for 

Make America Great Again, 
or the slogan of President 
Donald 
Trump’s 
campaign, 

covering what was originally 
welcoming messages painted 
by the newest student cohort of 
Assisting Latinos to Maximize 
Achievement. 

“I thought this would be sort 

of taking action as opposed to 
writing a letter that students 
know is important, but this 
would be a different approach,” 
said David Schoem, director 
of the Community Scholars 
Program, who decided to paint 
over the writing.. “So the idea 
is to reclaim the rock and the 
campus for all the students at U 
of M and drive out, paint away 
the hate.”

Students and faculty painted 

the rock completely white, 
obscuring any other writing 
and then painted phrases such 
as “Latinx belongs,” and the 
names of other LSA programs 
in a show of solidarity.

“The message I think we’re 

writing is we support Latinx 
students and (Assisting Latinos 

to Maximize Achievement),” 
Schoem said. “We want to set 
things right before classes 
start: that we’re all here as 
a community, every student 
counts, every student owns 
this University and we’re going 
to stand together to make sure 
that’s the case, that everybody 
feels this is their University.”

LSA 
sophomore 
Noelle 

Wade, a member of the Lloyd 
Hall 
Scholars 
Program, 

attended the event in a show 
of solidarity with the Latino 
community.

“I decided to come out today 

because social justice is a very 
big passion of mine and if I can 
support marginalized students 
on campus, I will,” Wade said. 
“(LHSP) 
decided 
to 
come 

out as a group and show our 
support for Latinx students on 
campus.”

Wade 
included 
that 
it’s 

important to show that the 
University 
doesn’t 
approve 

of the messages that were 
previously painted on the rock 
in order to support students 
from various backgrounds and 

ethnicities.

“It sets a happy tone (for this 

school year) because it shows 
that a bunch of different people, 
from a bunch of different walks 
of life, different ethnicities, 
can come together and support 
someone else,” Wade said. 
“Maybe you aren’t the person 
it was directed toward, but 
maybe you know how it feels 
and you came out and showed 
support and that shows that the 
University of Michigan can be a 
… welcoming environment and 
a supporting environment.”

Forty-two clubs and University-

sponsored organizations welcomed 
incoming LGBT freshmen and 
allies to the University with the 
annual Pride Outside event at 
Palmer Field Monday. 

Formerly known as Gayz Craze, 

Pride Outside is sponsored by 
Out in STEM, an organization 
that supports LGBT students in 
Engineering and STEM fields. 
The event, which attracted about 
500 students, was sponsored by 
Central 
Student 
Government 

but was transferred to oSTEM 
two years ago when Engineering 
senior Sindhu Sreedhar offered 
to bring the event under oSTEM’s 
leadership.

Twelve clubs were specifically 

for LGBT students, though all 
organizations represented are in 
support of creating safe spaces for 
LGBT students, including social 
justice and volunteer organizations.

“We try to get organizations that 

are really built around community 
building 
and 
community 

organizing so we can cater towards 
the LGBTQ community in that 
way,” Sreedhar said.

Research encompasses high-performance computing, analytics and management

In recent years, big data emerged 

as a powerful tool, spurring the 
University of Michigan to dedicate 
an initiative and institute to its 

study and implementation.

In a statement in 2015, Jack Hu, 

vice president for research at the 
University, wrote that big data — 
exorbitantly large data sets that 
can be parsed to show trends and 
associations — was “revolutionizing 
research in extraordinary range of 

disciplines.”

The University’s financial and 

professional investment in data 
science has since proven beneficial; 
with $100 million subsidizing 
the 
University’s 
Data 
Science 

Initiative over five years, faculty 
members from multidisciplinary 

and intersectional departments 
have been part of grounding the 
University’s research in modern 
data computation, analytics and 
management.

“With this initiative, our goal 

is to spark innovation in research

Philbert, the former dean, who is 
now the University’s provost.

“It’s something that has been 

talked about at various times here 
in the School of Public Health

At 4:19 p.m. on Monday, Sept. 4, the 

Diag was packed with freshmen looking for 

Angell Hall. Suddenly, as the clock struck 

4:20, the whoops and hollers of University 

of Michigan shinobi echoed over the trees. 

Heads darted toward the corner of North 

University and State Street. A plethora of 

anime cosplayers was barreling towards the 

Block M.

In a momentous display of solidarity, 

courage and love of meme culture, about 

200 students pulled themselves up by their 

ninja sandals, threw their arms into the 

wind and booked it across the Diag as a part 

of the “Run Across the Diag Naruto Style” 

Facebook event. Naruto, a popular Japanese 

anime, features a young shinobi (dubbed 

as ninja in the U.S. version) named Naruto 

Uzumaki and centers around his quest to be 

a respected ninja.

According to the Facebook description, 

the event spawned from a previous event 

in Pittsburgh titled “Come to the Smash 

Mouth Concert Dressed as Shrek” and 

gained further popularity in the infamous 

“UMich Memes for Wolverteens” page.

For those unfamiliar with the 

particular techniques of running like 

Naruto, wikiHow reports proper form 

mandates a true shinobi should lean 

forward with your back straight, keep your 

head up to look for oncoming enemies and 

hold both arms behind you for maximum 

speed.

Engineering junior Veronika Bayer, 

who created the event, led the pack of meme 

enthusiasts in full Naruto cosplay with the 

orange jacket, pants and headband. She 

cited meme and troll culture as the main 

reasons for the event’s popularity online 

and the large physical attendance. She also 

said many of the attendees watched the 

Naruto anime when they were younger and 

can now unleash their inner child as they 

run across the campus they love so much.

“Michigan is a place where everyone 

can learn how to be free and enjoy 

themselves and really embrace themselves 

in all of their weirdness and quirks,” she 

said.

MEME RIES

Just in time for tailgate 

season, a new product has 
arrived at the University of 
Michigan’s campus: the Bois. 
The Bois is a luxury bottle-
opening wallet — founders Ken 
Kernen and Philip Ruffini call it 
the first of its kind.

Business students Kernen, a 

sophomore, and Ruffini, a junior, 
met through the Delta Upsilon 
fraternity but have become 
better friends through their 
shared interests in e-commerce 
businesses and enrollment in 
Ross School of Business.

“Whenever I have a question, 

he is able to provide some 
feedback,” 
Kernen 
said 
of 

Ruffini. “We will shoot each 
other 
messages 
and 
they’ll 

either 
be 
about 
minimum 

order quantity or just a fun 
conversation 
immediately. 

There is no barrier or hesitation 
to have any conversation with 
him.”

In June of 2017, Kernen 

received a phone call from 
Ruffini 
in 
regard 
to 
the 

popularity of project-funding 
site 
Kickstarter 
and 
asked 

Kernen as to what he thought 
about 
pursuing 
something 

within 
the 
Kickstarter 

marketplace. Kickstarter is a 
crowdfunding site that provides 
a platform for entrepreneurs to 
gauge interest and demand for 
their products. Sellers choose a 
monetary goal and a time frame 
in which they plan on raising 

those funds — if they do not 
succeed, they do not make any 
money.

“He’s a very entrepreneurial 

guy, and is able to recognize 
opportunity very easily,” Kernen 
said. The two decided to begin 
working together to create a 
product.

“The first week was just ideas, 

ideas, ideas,” Kernen said about 
the events following the phone 
call. “We were thinking about 
doing wallets, some sort of 
wallet. And then we were like, 
‘It would be cool if it had a bottle 
opener on it.’”

In week two, the decision 

about what materials to use 
began.

across campus while inspiring 
further advances in the techniques 
of data science itself,” Hu also said 
in 2015.

Big data has been the crux of 

medical initiatives and disease 
research, 
the 
uncovering 
of 

international corruption scandals 
such as in the Panama Papers, 
and worldwide technological and 
economic development.

For example, access to massive 

deposits of information related to 
issues such as on-field behavior 
can help predict athletic-related 
injuries, teaching and learning 
analytics can lead researchers 
to 
create 
better 
educational 

techniques, 
and 
patterns 
in 

accumulated patient data could 
help doctors discover preventative 
measures 
diagnose 
health 

conditions.

Now celebrating two years at the 

University, the Michigan Institute 
for Data Science — an institute 
under the umbrella of the DSI — has 
expanded as a multidisciplinary 
and 
interdepartmental 
sphere 

for all research in data, much 
alongside two other sectors of the 
DSI, including Advanced Research 
Computing – Technology Services 
and 
Consulting 
for 
Statistics, 

Computing 
and 
Analytics 

Research.

Co-director of MIDAS Brian 

Athey, a professor of computational 
medicine and bioinformatics, said 
innovations continue as the quest 
for finding new ways to use big data 
grows.

**********
Even before this influx of data-

driven institutions, researchers at 
the University had been using these 
large data sets to tackle issues such 
as disease prediction and augment 
the research of computer science.

Eric Michielssen, University 

associate 
vice 
president 
of 

Advanced Research Computing – 
Technology Services, said there is 
a “tsunami” of data available for 
use for these issues and more, but 
he and Athey cited the importance 
of a concept called the Four V’s of 
Big Data.

Aside from simply the volume of 

data Michielssen said researchers 
consider velocity, or the ability to 
receive vast amounts of data with 
unprecedented speeds. They must 
also note the variety of formats 
available, not just the receipt of data 
through structured spreadsheets, 
and the veracity, or uncertainty 
and trustworthiness of the data 
received.

Michielssen, 
whose 
office 

is home to MIDAS and the 
overarching Data Science Institute, 
said collecting and generating data 
on a daily basis at unprecedented 
speeds — particularly through 
social media, financial transactions 
and a newly coined “internet of 
things,” where objects are given 
the ability to share data through 
sensors, wireless technology and 
complex networks — requires 
researchers to consider how to 
leverage that data for the good of 
society and science, making it an 
innovative phenomenon.

“It’s nothing short of a game 

changer 
for 
society, 
as 
well 

as for science and education.” 
Michielssen said. “Research in just 
about every field is being affected 
by this new phenomenon, this big 

data phenomenon.”

According to Athey, the overall 

significance of data science at a 
university level — especially in the 
context of the University’s top-
ranking research across the board 
— is that much of the University’s 
history 
in 
machine 
learning, 

data 
analytics, 
statistics 
and 

computation has already paved the 
way to today’s methodologies.

“We had an ideal environment 

to do this at U of M,” Athey said. 
Noting an increase in the power 
of computing and a decrease in its 
cost — also known as Moore’s law 
— Athey said, “Data science and 
big data are transformational to 
society and higher ed.”

The modern data scientist isn’t 

surrounded by rows of outdated 
computers that flash neon green 
numbers, 
MIDAS 
Managing 

Director Kevin Smith said.

Instead, Smith said, managing 

data today requires the three-
fold collaboration of MIDAS — 
the University’s academic hub 
— a focus on data science services 
such 
as 
consulting 
through 

CSCAR and a central avenue for 
high-performance 
computing 

infrastructure through ARC-TS.

“This 
is 
really 
thinking 

holistically about how you take 
data and be able to integrate and 
aggregate it in a meaningful way 
so that you can explore that data in 
the context of whatever scientific 
or business problems you’re trying 
to solve so that the analysis, the 
visualization, the exploration that 
you’re doing is valid,” Smith said.

Transportation and Tech
In much of its data science 

research, Michielssen said, the 
University 
focuses 
mostly 
on 

application rather than theory 
and method to yield more tangible 
results, 
especially 
through 

applications to policy, education 
and infrastructure.

“In many ways, we’re trying to 

frame this as an opportunity to 
advance the field of data science 
from a methodological perspective 
but in the context of the application 
of data science,” Smith added.

For example, researchers within 

MIDAS’s Centers for Data-Driven 
Transportation 
Research 
and 

that of Data-Intensive Learning 
Analytics Research are using data 
for improving automobile use and 
transportation, as well as creating 
new tools to examine the modern 
learning process.

Carol Flannagan, an associate 

research 
scientist 
for 
the 

University’s 
Transportation 

Research Institute, noted her 
team’s application of big data to the 
analysis and creation of simulations 
of 
driver 
behavior, 
traffic 

regulations 
and 
transportation 

systems, 
all 
with 
traditional, 

automated and connected vehicles.

“Transportation 
data 
is 

changing so fast,” Flannagan said. 
“It’s a really great area for novel 
applications of existing methods 
or even extensions of methods and 
new methods.”

In addition to working to 

expand 
the 
amount 
of 
data 

available to researchers in the field 
of transportation data analysis, 
Flannagan and her team have been 
successful in surveying motor 
vehicle crashes and establishing 
applications of crash-avoidance 
technologies. These applications 
can be transferred to vehicle 
occupant protection against and 
ideally, total crash prevention.

Through 
visualization 
tools 

and a surplus of traffic crash data, 
vehicle-centric 
countermeasures 

against 
vehicle 
crashes 
— 

particularly vehicle design — work 
in conjunction with behavior-
centric measures, roadway design 
and enforcement to produce new 
options for policymakers and 
infrastructure 
designers. 
This 

helps optimize design and laws and 
eliminate unnecessary crashes.

Taking a comprehensive view 

of safety, making predictions and 
taking into consideration laws that 
are working well for some aspects 
of driving allows researchers, 
policymakers 
and 
others 
to 

integrate and focus improvements 
elsewhere.

Flannagan 
said 
one 
thing 

that poses difficulty are quick 
accessibility and shareability of 
data.

“We are not freed from the 

requirement to think first before 
engaging with data analysis,” 
Flannagan pointed out. “The 
requirement to think first just 
got harder.”

Data science research does not 

come without other challenges, 
however, 
particularly 
in 
a 

changing landscape of big data.

Social Science and Challenges
In May 2014, former President 

Barack Obama’s Executive Office 
released an official White House 
report detailing the significance 
of upholding privacy values, 
responsible education in a digital 
age and using data as a public 
resource.

“Properly implemented, big 

data will become an historic 
driver of progress, helping our 
nation perpetuate the civic and 
economic dynamism that has 
long been its hallmark,” the 
report reads.

Since then, the nationwide 

use of big data has more 
recently been at the heart of 
controversy surrounding the 
2016 presidential election; big 
data was first seen as generally 
predictive for the election’s 
results, though others claim 
now-President Trump’s initial 
dismissal of the importance of 
data was a mask for his use of 
the information to target rural 
voters.

The 
work 
of 
research 

professor 
Michael 
Traugott, 

for example, could be applied 
to ultimately help prevent the 
effects of social media and news 
content on election outcomes.

Traugott and his team — in 

collaboration with Gallup and 
Georgetown University — have 
been collecting data to examine 
political communication in the 
2016 
presidential 
campaign. 

By using computer software 
to search for key topics and 
sentiment 
in 
open-ended 

question 
responses 
from 

thousands 
of 
participants 

throughout 
the 
election, 

researchers 
can 
check 
the 

representativeness on people’s 
opinions related to what they’ve 
seen on social media in terms of 
news.

A 
computerized 
content 

analysis of nine major U.S. 
newspapers 
can 
also 
be 

compared 
with 
attitudes 

and content in the tweets of 
journalists, another indicator of 
how news content is related to 
citizen sentiment later.

“I have been surprised by the 

emphasis on personality at the very 
earliest stage of the campaign and 
the disproportionate amount of 
coverage that (Trump) received,” 
Traugott said. “We hope to be able 
to track the news content sentiment 
against the favorability measures, 
as well as the topics mentioned in 
the open-ended (questions with 
participants).”

Traugott will use this data 

to establish whether traditional 
framing and agenda-setting themes 
are still present in contemporary 
reporting, but in a social media 
environment.

Because of the possibilities 

big data can hold in a politically 
charged and competitive social 
sphere, The Washington Post 
has called for further privacy 
considerations and tech policy 
amid the endless possibilities big 
data presents. It also noted that 
an inherent bias in data’s original 
collection — no matter how big 

or small — will continue to have 
consequences, resulting in what 
some refer to as a dangerous and 
ominous future.

Concerns 
for 
privacy 
and 

confidentiality 
are 
other 

unexpected 
hurdles 
University 

researchers grapple with daily 
— transportation data, medical 
records 
and 
social 
science 

information are just three avenues 
through which data can come that 
need to be secure.

“Someone has to put in place 

measures, software systems that 
allow one to do research and 
developments in this space while 
at the same time, guaranteeing 
the privacy of the person who gave 
rights to the data in the first place,” 
Michielssen said.

Fear of the unknown is another 

complication, Athey said, as the 
dearth of research in big data’s 
abilities 
makes 
future 
uses 

frighteningly ambiguous. 

“Data science could be used 

to help society or frankly, could 
be used to take advantage of 
different groups within society or 
manipulate things,” Athey said. 
“Those that have the methodology 
and the computing and the access to 
the data have a distinct advantage 
on everybody. That could be used 
for good or for bad.”

Being data-illiterate comes with 

consequences, he explained.

“If you’re uneducated about 

data science and if you don’t know 
how to practice it, you would be a 
victim of it,” Athey said. “This is 
the society that we’re living in — 
Google and all these things — are 
not going to go away.”

Likewise, Smith noted an issue 

of ethics clouding global data 
science.

sophomore year. This year, there 

were 131 complete applications.

Harper said there continues to 

be a lot of interest in the program, 
even inquiries from high school 
students who have heard about 
the new major and are wondering 
what they can do to be accepted as 
sophomores.

“The group of applicants were 

all, I would say, stellar applicants 
— people with a lot of great 
experiences, a lot of really beneficial 
coursework,” he said. “It was a 
quite impressive group. In terms 
of what we’re looking for, we really 
do take a holistic approach to the 
review process. We’re not just 
looking for some particular GPA 
cutoff. We are really looking at 
well-rounded students that have a 
good understanding of what public 
health is and what public health 
does, and a real commitment and 

compassion for public health.”

Harper referenced a set of 

guiding principles, which can be 
found on the program’s website, 
and said the program looks to see 
if applicants are in alignment with 
them. 
Such 
principles 
include 

social justice, cultural humility 
and interdisciplinary focus, among 
others.

In terms of acceptance, Harper 

said the program plans to keep its 
acceptance rate about the same for 
the next admissions cycle, about 
95. He said after the first cohort 
completes the program, it will likely 
increase the number of students 
admitted.

Logistically, 
the 
program 

offers either a Bachelor’s of Arts 
in community and global public 
health or a Bachelor’s of Science in 
public health sciences. According 
to Harper, within each major, there 
are a set of four integrated core 
courses, which address various 
aspects of public health, from an 
interdisciplinary and integrated 
lens.

“In graduate training in public 

health, you would take a course 
on epidemiology, a course on 
biostatistics, a course on health 
management, things like that,” 
Harper said. “What we’re doing 
is combining different aspects of 
public health and putting them 
together because at the core of our 
program, we’re really focusing on 
what we call liberal education.”

Liberal education, according to 

Harper, is an approach to learning 
that helps prepare students to deal 
with complexity, diversity and 
social change.

“We’re not just teaching public 

health skills,” he said. “Some types 
of undergraduate public health 
programs teach skills and they’re 
more of a skills training degree, then 
you get some kind of certification. 
We want students to be able to think 
in innovative and complex ways 
about the public health challenges 
that we currently face but then we 
want to prepare them for the future 
public health challenges. ”

Though the program is only in 

its first year, Harper said, based 
on statistics from other schools’ 
public health programs, some 
students are expected to go into 
medicine or other health-related 
fields, some go into graduate 
programs 
in 
public 
health, 

others go into the workforce — 
departments of public health, 
the Peace Corps or working in 
nonprofit organizations with a 
health focus — and some even go 
into law, engineering and other 
fields.

Faculty for the program will 

consist of faculty from the Public 
Health School, who teach graduate 
courses 
and 
have 
real-world 

experience in the field of public 
health.

Harper 
said 
the 
goal 
of 

the 
program 
is 
to 
take 
an 

interdisciplinary approach to think 
about critical public health issues. 
He the program will attack issues 
from multiple perspectives using 
different lenses. He said he thinks 
students will feel stimulated in 
classes to think about things in a 

different way.

Harper said the program will be 

evaluated over the course of the year 
and it will be seeking feedback from 
its first cohort about strengths and 
weaknesses to make improvements 
and provide the best educational 
experience possible.

This 
semester, 
Harper 
is 

teaching a new course developed 
for the program, called Community 
Culture and Social Justice in Public 
Health. It is required for the B.A. 
students; it can be taken as an 
elective for the B.S. students and 
is also offered to non-public health 
students.

“The course will really be an 

opportunity to explore, interrogate, 
understand, work with different 
concepts of community, of culture, of 
social justice, because a lot of people 
use these terms in public health 
and elsewhere, but don’t often have 
an in-depth understanding and 
meaning of (them),” he said. “I want 
to demystify and really have people 
think in a critical manner. I think 
overall we really want students to 

come out of this class being able to 
engage in a critical analysis of the 
field of public health.”

It is important to look at different 

public 
health 
challenges 
and 

the ways in which they’re being 
addressed by the nation, to find the 
flaws and strengths, both locally 
and globally, said Harper.

“There’s ways in which we are 

doing public health work in other 
countries and is it really done in a 
manner that is building capacity 
or is it a way that is making other 
countries dependent on us?” he 
said. “So it’s really that critical 
process of really thinking about all 
of these different aspects of public 
health intervention.”

health major who transferred from 
Oakland University. She was in a 
pre-professional health sciences 
program at Oakland and was a

“I think (these updates)

“It simplifies the process of 
needing your computer or 
having to go onto a University

an area without access to a 
campus computer.”

Bob Jones, ITS interim

way,” Sreedhar said.
Designed as a Welcome Week 

event, Sreedhar said, one of its 
main purposes is to introduce 
incoming freshmen the resources 
available on campus for LGBT 
students. Shreedhar said the tents 
are placed on Palmer Field because 
many freshmen live on the Hill 
and will be easily seen by incoming 
students walking around their 
dorms.

LSA senior Victoria Johnson 

attended the event as a freshman 
and this year represented the 
Coalition for Queer and Trans 
People of Color as a co-chair. She 
said Pride Outside helped her find 
the coalition and the timing of the 

event couldn’t be better.

“It can be hard and daunting, 

especially 
as 
an 
incoming 

freshman, trying to find your 
community and find people that 
you want to socialize with and 
hang out with,” she said. “Having 
events like this, especially during 
Welcome Week, this is the time 
everyone’s going to come out.”

When President Donald Trump 

proposed the transgender military 
ban back in July, many transgender 
students and allies on campus 
reacted adversely to the news. 
Johnson said pro-LGBT events like 
Pride Outside can contribute to a 
positive community on campus.

“People need community now 

more than ever,” she said. “Having 
events like these is super important 
to show that there are people here 
who are going to support you and be 

there for you and even when it feels 
like everything is going wrong and 
the world is crumbling apart, you 
still have these people you can turn 
to.”

LSA senior Yong-Joon Kim 

volunteers with the Sexual Assault 
Prevention and Awareness Center 
and represented the organization at 
a booth at Pride Outside. He echoed 
Johnson’s sentiments and said the 
event is crucial for newer students 
trying to find resources.

“Marginalized identities, as we 

know, on this campus have been 
facing a lot of hate and negative stuff 
going on right now so just having an 
event during Welcome Week that 
allows LGBT students to know 
they’re welcome on this campus, 
especially one that’s catered by the 
student governance organizations, 
definitely helps show unity and 

acceptance on this campus,” he said.

According to the 2015 Campus 

Climate Survey, lesbian, gay or 
bisexual students were 2.5 times 
more at risk for sexual assault than 
heterosexual students. By working 
with SAPAC, a University sponsored 
program, Kim said it shows how the 
University is dedicated to helping 
LGBT students feel free to speak 
about sexual assault.

LSA freshman Cheyanne Killin 

said the large-scale event showed 
her how many resources she 
actually has on campus from clubs 
and students alike.

“I think it’s really nice to have 

this inclusion here,” she said. “It’s 
such a positive space and coming 
from a community where I didn’t 
have that ability to be proud of who 
I was, this is just massive to know 
that I’m supported here.”

Opinion

W

hen 
asked 
about 

the 
violent 
white 

supremacist, 
neo-

Nazi rally that occurred in 
Charlottesville, Va., a few weeks 
ago, President Donald Trump 
not-so-deftly shifted attention 
to the “alt-Left that came 
charging at (the neo-Nazis)” 
asking, “(D)o they have any 
semblance of guilt?” President 
Trump’s false equivalency of 
the 
predominantly 
peaceful 

counterprotesters with the neo-
Nazis (one of whom actually 
murdered a counterprotester) 
at Charlottesville is but the 
latest in a growing tradition 
of conservatives attempting to 
delegitimize liberal, and often 
student, protesters as either silly 
and inconsequential children or 
dangerous free speech fascists. 
These attacks on protesters 
are both wrongheaded and 
a 
potential 
threat 
to 
the 

constitutionally 
guaranteed 

right to freely assemble.

Fascinatingly, 
conservative 

commentators 
employ 
what 

appear to be two diametrically 
opposed lines of attack against 
student 
protesters 
whose 

causes they deem illegitimate. 
First, pundits sneer at self-
important millennials overly 
triggered 
by 
such 
“trivial” 

matters as systematic racism 
or police brutality. Former 
host for “The Blaze” Tomi 
Lahren 
has 
achieved 
viral 

star status on social media by 
insulting “typical snowflake 
millennials.” 
After 
protests 

broke out on college campuses 
throughout the nation in the 
days after Trump’s election, 
Lahren 
stated: 
“A 
protest 

is a peaceful objection to a 
grievance. A bunch of sore 
losers occupying a space is 
called a tantrum. …”

Pundits 
often 
paint 
a 

separate — and sometimes 
simultaneous — portrait of 
liberal student protesters as 
politically 
correct 
fascists 

ruthlessly 
silencing 
any 

voices they disagree with. 
These pundits seemingly miss 
the irony of simultaneously 
declaring student protesters 
to be whining babies and some 
sort 
of 
politically 
correct 

Gestapo.

Conflating 
peaceful 

protesters 
with 
violent, 

speech-suppressing 
activists 

is a transparent attempt to 
discredit and silence students 
with 
legitimate 
concerns 

about the threat to vulnerable 
groups 
the 
often 
racist 

and 
misogynistic 
rhetoric 

of speakers, such as Milo 

Yiannopoulos, pose. Students 
have the same freedom to object 
to 
Yiannopoulos’s 
language 

as Yiannopoulos has to speak 
in the first place. The right to 
peacefully protest the racism 
and 
misogyny 
of 
another 

individual isn’t a tantrum; it’s a 
constitutionally protected right 
and an American tradition. In 
addition, attributing violence to 
liberal protesters obscures the 
fact that right-wing extremists 
committed 
74 
percent 
of 

domestic 
extremist-related 

murders in the United States in 
the last decade.

Do not take my defense of 

young liberal protesters as a 
defense of anarchist violence as 
a means to silence ideological 
opponents. 
As 
dangerous, 

violent and disgusting neo-
Nazis and white supremacists 
are, 
normalizing 
violence 

against 
these 
groups 

normalizes political violence 
in a manner which could 
ultimately harm the vulnerable 
individuals 
and 
minorities 

the left seeks to empower. 
Legitimizing 
violence 
sets 

anti-governmental and anti-
constitutional precedents neo-
Nazis and white supremacists 
could seize upon throughout 
and beyond the Trump era.

Beyond being a completely 

valid 
and 
constitutionally 

protected 
form 
of 
self-

expression, 
protests 
simply 

work. Perhaps the most obvious 
value of protests is their sheer 
visibility. 
The 
larger 
and 

more 
raucous 
the 
protest, 

the more media attention the 
protest receives. The attention 
protests generate act as a sort of 
protective shield for minority 
groups 
without 
proper 

representation in democratic 
countries. Think of Gandhi’s 
Salt March in India, civil rights 
activists being sprayed with 
fire hoses in Birmingham, Ala. 
or, more recently, the police 
decked out in full military 
gear 
to 
control 
protesters 

in 
Ferguson, 
Mo. 
Media 

dissemination 
of 
protests 

promulgates bad press, which 
pressures elected leaders to 
acknowledge, and sometimes 
acquiesce to, the grievances of 
marchers. Student protesters 
demonstrated the power of bad 
press during the ’60s and ’70s 
when student activism against 
the 
Vietnam 
War 
helped 

garner enough public ill will to 
ultimately halt the conflict. 

Protests 
also 
act 
as 
a 

gathering ground for like-
minded individuals to build 
political 
community 
and 

solidarity. 
Marches 
and 

gatherings offer a critical space 
for citizens to collectively 
grieve, celebrate or diffuse 
anger. 
The 
community 

building aspect of protests 
becomes especially important 
when responding to tragedies. 
Following the death of counter 
protester Heather Hayes in 
Charlottesville, thousands of 
University of Virginia students 
held a candlelight vigil to 
mourn and broadcast campus 
solidarity in the face of hate.

Traditionally, invisible and 

underrepresented groups find 
these 
spaces 
critical. 
From 

the 
1960s 
through 
today, 

LGBTQ individuals have found 
validation, 
security, 
dignity 

and joy through Pride parades. 
Whether marching for basic 
dignity in the 1960s, AIDS relief 
in the ’80s and ’90s or the right 
to marry before 2015, otherwise 
invisible gender and sexuality 
non-conforming young people 
have used Pride parades to 
break out into the open.

Lastly, protests act as an 

entry point to further political 
activism for many students. 
Most protests entail much 
more than simply marching 
down a street chanting slogans 
and holding signs. Protests 
may begin or end with a slew of 
speakers offering information 
about 
the 
topic 
being 

protested. Organizers often 
give marchers a suggestion of 
relevant nonprofits to donate 
to in the future. In addition, 
some 
protests 
include 

political 
workshops 
where 

attendees sign up for political 
organizations 
or 
nonprofits 

and 
receive 
training 
in 

fundraising and other forms 
of 
political 
activism. 
The 

nationwide Women’s March 
in January initiated a wave 
of female candidates running 
for office and young people 
getting involved in politics.

Peaceful 
public 

demonstrations 
are 
the 

backbone 
of 
democratic 

free speech traditions and 
promulgate critical political 
action. 
Consequently, 
petty 

attacks on students peacefully 
exercising 
their 
right 
to 

protest 
only 
undermines 

a 
fundamental 
American 

tradition. 
Young 
protesters 

have been critical in every 
social movement in the United 
States, from civil rights to 
sexual liberation. 

A

s 
Ann 
Arbor 

becomes 
flooded 

with 
micromanaging 

parents and awkward-yet-eager 
freshman, I revel in the sight 
of familial dynamics. It’s like a 
reality TV show except I don’t 
need a Netflix account and only 
need to peer out my window to 
get a sense of the action. 

The 
opportunity 
that 
a 

summer break affords is a chance 
to scrutinize and think critically 
about many different issues — 
that is, before the stress comes 
when thinking about starting 
anew in September. Over the past 
few weeks, there has been a lot of 
misleading news concerning the 
state of education in Michigan. 
The nerves brought about by 
moving 
to 
school 
somehow 

trickles down to journalists who 
write about this topic. 

Going back to school was 

always a struggle for me. I 
went to summer camp for eight 
years growing up, and after not 
having to care about anything 
related to academics for two 
months, it was difficult to 
acclimate to tests, reading and 
writing essays. I still struggle 
with this dilemma. Since our 
summer break is nearly four 
months long, it’s easy to forget 
what being in school is like. 

Would 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan be better suited with 
a shorter summer break? In a 
recent article published in The 
Atlantic titled “Why School 
Still Starts After Labor Day in 
Michigan,” the case is made for 
a shorter summer break. Mind 
you, this article only addresses 
our 
state’s 
K-12 
education 

system, but a similar case could 
be made for our universities. 

Most of my friends at other 

Big 10 colleges have already 
been in school for a few weeks, 
and sometimes I wonder if I’m 
missing out by not starting 
earlier. 
However, 
our 
long 

summer affords us so many 
opportunities 
that 
are 
not 

available 
during 
the 
school 

year. With just a short break, 

students would find it much 
harder to be able to pursue the 
internships, study abroad trips 
and 
research 
opportunities 

that many take advantage of. 

As students trickle back 

to 
school, 
national 
news 

organizations, such as The 
New 
York 
Times, 
devote 

substantial portions of their 
Sunday 
editions 
to 
higher 

education. More locally, the 
Detroit Free Press’s Mitch 
Albom wrote a column on 
going back to school. 

Albom, who says he was on 

a college campus last week, 
observed 
the 
madness 
of 

moving 
in. 
Unfortunately, 

for 
people 
from 
older 

generations, they are ticked 
off that we college students 
are 
too 
obsessed 
with 

intersectionality, 
technology 

and gender pronouns. Great 
stereotyping, right?

The 
point 
of 
Albom’s 

satirically tinged column was 
to note both the continuities 
and breaks between students 
from his college years and that 
of his offspring. But his diatribe 
falls into a trap of lambasting 
college millennials, and even 
may hurt the case for diversity 
at universities. 

Take a look at this bit: 

“After helping our son hang 
his flat screen and surround-
sound speakers, we went for 
a walk around campus. We 
saw the 24-hour state-of-the-
art exercise facility and the 
24-hour Apple computer labs. 
He showed us the ‘safe spaces’ 
where no offensive words can 
be used, and the ‘healing spaces’ 
where you can go if you were 
accidentally 
exposed 
to 
an 

offensive sentence.” 

OK, maybe I’m just being 

overly 
sensitive 
to 
that 

paragraph. But that’s fulfilling 
an incorrect stereotype, no? 

While 
Albom’s 
misguided 

rant 
on 
politically 
correct 

culture was not ideal, I must 
award merit to a recent New 
York 
Times 
infographic 

on 
college 
enrollment 
and 

diversity. The study found that 
as affirmative action policies 
have been implemented at many 
colleges nationwide, Black and 
Hispanic enrollment still lag 
behind. 

Lack of diversity is acute 

at our university, but it’s not 
just limited to this campus. 
Increasing diversity is a boon 
to improving an educational 
experience 
— 
students 
are 

able to better understand a 
variety of viewpoints and meet 
individuals from places they 
otherwise would not encounter. 

The University is a unique 

case given our vast academic 
opportunities, 
which 
our 

long summer break aids in 
facilitating. We have the chance 
to go home or wherever else we 
are spending our summers to 
help spread this diverse array 
of viewpoints we experience. 
And, if anything, we should be 
expanding these opportunities 
rather 
than 
stifling 
them. 

We can only hope that our 
institution’s new initiatives to 
address this problem will be 
successful. 

It’s 
frustrating 
that 

journalists are not always up to 
speed with the types of issues 
college students currently face. 
This may be attributed to the 
fact that many have not been 
enrolled in a university in quite 
a while. But after not having to 
worry about school for an entire 
season, it is imperative that 
students acknowledge how and 
why stories take the angle they 
do when covering the places 
they learn. My advice to other 
students, however, is not to 
panic even though journalists 
appear to be out of touch with 
issues that students are facing 
— the same way you shouldn’t 
panic over realizing how much 
work you have to do after only 
your first day of class.

M

y 
little 
sister 

absolutely 
loves 

back-to-school 

shopping. 
Everything 
about 

it excites her, from the color 
coordination of her notebooks 
and pencils to the smooth glide 
of Paper Mate InkJoy pens. I 
make fun of her a lot, calling 
her things like “nerd.” I differ 
from my sister in the sense that 
I couldn’t care less about which 
brand of notebooks or pens my 
mother bought. But when I 
reflect upon it, in my younger 
years, I, too, shared similar 
excitement. 
I 
enjoyed 
the 

newness of it all: new textbooks, 
new teachers, new classmates, 
new locker assignments. Even 
the floors were freshly buffed 
and waxed, the walls sticky 
with a coat of new paint. 

When 
I 
entered 
college, 

I was promptly and totally 
overstimulated 
by 
my 

excitement 
with 
the 
new 

environment. Yet, it introduced 
some of the worst nerves I have 
ever experienced in my life. 
For a homebody and introvert 
like myself, having to live on 
my own away from home for 
the first time was terrifyingly 
overwhelming. 
However, 
as 

my time at the University 
of 
Michigan 
progressed, 
I 

adjusted and found solace in my 
“new” normal routine.

With the impending start of 

what will be my last year as an 
undergraduate, my nerves have 
returned, and my short-lived 
comfort has ceased. Though 
the University has remained 
the same since my arrival, 
everything outside of it has 
turned completely upside down. 
Bigotry, hate, racism and utter 
dissolution have begun to bubble 

and now fester like sores within 
our 
communities, 
seemingly 

stemming from the root of the 
executive branch of government.

That being said, the essence 

of my fear lies within the 
chaos of the outside world 
penetrating the little bubble 
of our campus, as our campus 
has been extremely susceptible 
to 
racist 
and 
oppressive 

messaging, 
defilement 
and 

hate speech that has surfaced 
within recent years. So, as we 
all pack our bags, whether they 
contain InkJoy pens or color-
coordinated notebooks, I ask 
the questions: How do we learn 
to cancel out the noise? Do we 
remain fearless and poised in the 
face of negativity? How do we 
challenge ourselves to support 
each other in times of need? 
And how do we learn to not 
only understand each other, but 
refrain from becoming inept to 
embracing others’ differences?

This is no small feat, and 

by the looks of the racially 
charged incidents on campus 
in recent years, the answers 
to these questions have yet 
to reveal themselves. My fear 
additionally stems from the 
realization that I have absolutely 
no idea what the future holds for 
American society.

Though 
racism, 
hatred 

and oppression have found 
a home in this country for 
centuries, I think it’s safe to say 
these societal sores resurged 
forcefully and publicly after 
the 2016 presidential election. 
This may sound outrageous to 
admit, but I have absolutely no 
clue why people are so upset 
with President Donald Trump. 
As if he did not foreshadow 
the 
executive 
decisions 

he has enacted during his 
campaign. As if he did not 
reveal his prejudices prior to 
his inauguration. As if he did 
not instill fear within minority 
groups in the United States and 
spread hateful rhetoric through 
his speeches.

No one should be surprised 

by 
the 
events 
that 
have 

unfolded across the course 
of these few months of his 
presidency, 
simply 
because 

he told us they would happen 
beforehand, just as no one 
should 
be 
shocked 
with 

regards to his motives.

However, what should be 

excessively upsetting is the 
fact that there were enough 
like-minded 
people 
within 

our country to elect someone 
with values rooted in racism 
and bigotry. It is this portion 
of 
the 
population, 
which 

seeks to invite hate to college 
campuses, as we witnessed in 
the devastating events which 
took place in Charlottesville, 
Va., a few weeks back. Can 
these 
types 
of 
hate-filled 

infections reach a campus like 
the University? Am I valid for 
experiencing 
some 
anxiety 

because I almost expect this?

As my sister readies herself 

for her first day of class and 
fills her backpack with all 
of her new fancy pens and 
notebooks, I prep for my first 
day by crossing my fingers that 
this year will not bring the “alt-
right,” neo-Nazis and white 
nationalists to our campus.

How are you going to spend 

your first day?

The first day

Local playwright 
unveils work 
on Tennessee 
Williams

THEATRE

It all began when LSA Junior 

Max Vinogradov and his good 
friend 
Jackson 
Abohasira 

decided to make short films 
together, creating funny scripts 
to match their ideas. Those 
short films turned into a series 
of small projects that combined 
creativity with a touch of 
theatre.

Vinogradov 
recently 
won 

the Hopwood award in Drama, 

and the Dennis McIntyre Prize 
for his play, “A Night of Stars 
with 
Tennessee 
Williams.” 

The 
Slipstream 
Theatre 

Initiative, located in Ferndale, 
MI, has taken Vinogradov’s 
script to the stage. In addition 
to 
Vinogradov’s 
success, 

Abohasira, who plays Andy 
Warhol and Marlon Brando 
in the show, recently won the 
Wilde Award for Rising Star.

“Moving it from writing to 

the stage is an awesome thing 
and a bad thing,” Vinogradov 
said. “You look at this precious 

thing that you wrote and you’re 
like ‘this is what I was thinking 
about,’ but at the same time, 
so much of it is letting the 
actors discover the characters 

themselves.”

The play explores the life 

of 
Tennessee 
Williams, 
an 

American 
playwright 
that 

revolutionized 
20th-century 

drama in America with works 
such as “The Glass Menagerie,” 
“A Streetcar Named Desire,” 
“Cat on a Hot Tin Roof” 
and “Sweet Bird of Youth.” 

Vinogradov’s play, “A Night 
of 
Stars 
with 
Tennessee 

Williams,” projects a series 
of Williams’ memories, which 
include numerous stars, like 
Frank Merlo, Truman Capote, 
Andy Warhol, Marlon Brando 
and 
Greta 
Garbo, 
among 

others, who come to Williams 
with hopes of landing a role in 

one of his plays.

The play moves through a 

series of memories, recalling 
the lives of stars that brought 
Williams’s 
scripts 
to 
life. 

Though the connects scenes 
with 
iconic 
figures, 
they 

are somewhat obstructed by 
Williams’s recollection of the 
past.

“He (Williams) was an 

alcoholic and a drug abuser, so 
his memories are destroyed, 
in many senses,” Vinogradov 
explained. “He is trying to 
change 
the 
memories 
he 

recalls, because there are 
things he really screwed up, 
and relationships he is trying 
to save — but he really can’t.”

With 
extensive 

research 
into 
Williams’s 

life, 
Vinogradov 
grew 
to 

understand the playwright’s 
lasting impact.

“Williams 
made 
the 

memory play. I think what a 
lot of it has to do with is what 
we choose to remember,” 
Vinogradov 
said. 
“In 
his 

blackouts 
due 
to 
alcohol, 

he has lost all these good 
memories, and the things that 
withstood were traumas that 

were just too great to be deleted. 
They persisted and the question 
is: Is that a choice?”

Through the making of this 

piece, Vinogradov grappled with 
questions of what we choose to 
remember. Vinogradov found 
that the more he thought about 
these questions, the more they 
emerged 
through 
Williams’s 

memoirs.

“Marlon Brando, for example, 

was just recently discovered to 
have raped a woman on set,” 
Vinogradov said. “This icon for 
so many of us just instantly fell 
to ashes. At first I kind of wrote 
him as a monster. And then I 
had to come to terms with that 
being a little too easy.”

In 
understanding 
human 

flaws that can’t be removed 
from 
remaking 
a 
memory, 

Vinogradov creates the depth 
that his characters demand.

“How do you make him 

complicated without forgiving 
him? The way we kind of 
learned that … the person who 
hates him more than anyone 
else is himself. That was a really 
delicate thing to dance around,” 
Vinogradov said.

While discussing character 

relationships, and sharing about 
what each actor has brought 
to each role, Vinogradov found 
that 
the 
actors 
discovered 

elements of the script that he 
wasn’t 
even 
aware 
existed. 

Through these elements, two 
main themes rest at the heart of 
Vinogradov’s script.

“The first is the idea that for 

something to really be beautiful, 
it 
needs 
to 
have 
ugliness. 

Beauty is a direct perspective of 
something else we are looking 
at. In order for you to have 
lived a beautiful life and a good 
life, you have to recognize the 
ugly things that happened,” 
Vinogradov said. “The other 
thing that really impacted me 
is the idea that you are not what 
you’ve done, but what you do. 
You can become the person you 
want to be.”

Despite the rather tragic 

events 
that 
unfold 
in 
the 

play, the audience is left with 
an 
overwhelming 
sense 
of 

optimism.

“When you are put in the 

midst of such horrible things 
— we as human beings are 
awesome. We are going to find 
things to grasp onto and love.”

Latest PVRIS album is 
catchy & thrillingly dark 

“You took my heaven away,” 

sings Lynn Gunn on “Heaven,” 
the first track of PVRIS’s new 
album All We Know of Heaven, 
All We Need of Hell. This 
sentiment — anguished and 
accusatory, the lyrics backed 
by a hard swell of rock — sets 
the tone for the rest of the 
album, a self-assured musical 
exploration that is as angry and 
troubled as it is fierce.

All We Know of Heaven, All We 

Need of Hell is PVRIS’s second 
album after their well-received 
debut, White Noise. It includes 
much of the emotional force 
and honesty that originally 
made White Noise popular, and 
refreshingly, it accomplishes the 
rare feat of not reaching too far 
beyond itself. The rock-infused 
approach to songs like “Heaven” 
and “No Mercy” is hard and 
dark, but not oppressive, and the 
lyrics are dramatic, but don’t 
come across as presumptuous 
or overused. This is especially 
true on “What’s Wrong,” with 
the repeated line, “You don’t 
need a metaphor to know I’m 
miserable.” The result is an 
album that is sure of itself, 
well defined and enthrallingly 
catchy.

It’s also very cohesive; the 

hard-edged 
guitar 
chords 

and ripped-raw lyrics carry 
the listener through anger, 
desperation, 
sorrow 
and 

finally numb resignation in 
the span of 10 songs, and at no 
point do the transitions feel 
jarring or unearned. This is in 
part because one of PVRIS’s 
strengths is their ability to 
balance 
soft, 
contemplative 

melodies with active, livid rock, 
often within the space of a single 

song. For instance, “Separate” 
starts out with a gentle (albeit 
dark) electronic ambience that, 
through 
steady 
drums 
and 

mounting production, escalates 
smoothly into a chorus that 
feels at once angry, waking 
and alive. The most surprising 
thing 
is 
that 

the 
transition 

is 
so 
seamless 

— 
it’s 
difficult 

to 
notice 
it’s 

even 
happening 

until it’s already 
over. The album 
comes full circle 
particularly 
in 

its 
final 
track, 

“Nola 1,” which 
incorporates 
the tune of the 
chorus of the earlier track, 
“What’s Wrong.”

An 
especially 
appealing 

aspect of All We Know of Heaven, 

All We Need of Hell is that while 
it was clearly carefully produced 
and arranged, it doesn’t lean on 
its own skillful production to 
carry the meaning. The lyrics 
also hold up to scrutiny in their 
own right. Early on, “Anyone 
Else” cuts to the bone with 
lyrics like “’Cause I could touch 

a hundred thousand souls / But 
none of them would ever feel 
like home,” and “Nola 1” closes 
out the album with skewed and 
scattered images of a house 
once haunted. Things do get a 
little cliché and melodramatic 
in “Walk Alone” (“I was the 

smoke 
in 
your 

lungs tearing you 
apart,” “Darling, I 
always knew that 
we were doomed,” 
etc.). 
However, 

every song on the 
album 
puts 
in 

at least a strong 
effort where lyrics 
are 
concerned, 

both 
in 
terms 

of visibility and 
description and in 

terms of honesty.

For all its merits, it must 

be said that All We Know of 
Heaven, All We Need of Hell 
doesn’t take PVRIS very far 
away from White Noise in terms 
of artistic direction. It’s darker 
and feels more complete and 
realized, but doesn’t mark any 
drastic new risks or interesting 
incorporations of new genres. 
Every once in a while it feels 
generic, because when you’re 
singing 
about 
relationship 

turmoil and tension from a 
frame as broad as heaven and 
hell, it’s hard not to get a little 
generic at times. But this is 
only the band’s second album, 
and it still stands alone as a 
dark, snappy and quality piece 
of work. The lyrics, production 
and melodies all contribute an 
equal effort to make the album: 
A strong representation of the 
turmoil that comes at the end 
of a relationship, and what that 
can mean emotionally for all 
involved.

‘Game of Thrones’ season 
seven finishes strong

Since its premiere in 2011, 

“Game of Thrones” has developed 
a reputation for bold, sweeping 
season finales. That’s not to take 
anything away from the rest of the 
series’s episodes, which are equally 
ridiculous 
and 
consequential, 

but only to say that 
“Game of Thrones”’ 
finales have become 
almost larger-than-
life. True to form, the 
latest season send-
off, “The Dragon 
and the Wolf,” more 
than lives up to this 
tradition. 
Capping 

off 
the 
show’s 

seventh 
season 

masterfully, 
“The 

Dragon and the Wolf” redeems 
some of the series’s earlier season 
missteps and reminds audiences 
of the show’s status as television 
royalty.

Clocking in at 81 minutes, “The 

Dragon and the Wolf” is a massive 
cinematic 
episode 
that 
sees 

“Thrones” scheming at its best, 
with the Starks and the Lannisters 
leading the way. Having followed 
Sansa 
Stark 
(Sophie 
Turner, 

“Barely Lethal”) through her 
brutal 
upbringing 
in 
King’s 

Landing, viewers finally got to 
witness the culmination of Sansa’s 
transformation into a merciless 
and cunning Lady of Winterfell. In 
one of the most powerful scenes of 
“The Dragon and the Wolf,” Sansa 
beautifully conspires with Arya 
Stark (Maisie Williams, “iBoy”) to 
finally extract vengeance against 
Petyr “Littlefinger” Baelish (Aidan 
Gillen, “The Wire”). Watching 
Sansa use lessons in ruthlessness 
learned from Littlefinger himself 

— the architect of much of her 
suffering — was simply incredible. 
Elsewhere, in King’s Landing, 
Cersei Lannister (Lena Headley, 
“The Brothers Grimm”) concocts a 
brilliant plan with Euron Greyjoy 
(Pilou Asbæk, “Lucy”) to stealthily 
ferry 
The 
Golden 
Company 

mercenaries to Westeros.

While 
Cersei’s 
maneuver 

to bolster the Lannister army 

through 
mercenaries 
figures to be a 
central aspect of 
the next and final 
season, 
Season 

Eight 
seems 

primed 
to 
be 

dominated by the 
war between the 
White 
Walkers 

and 
the 
Stark-

Targaryen allied 

forces. “The Dragon and the Wolf” 
did a great job of featuring many 
of the series’s various overlapping 
stories, while still making clear 
that this war between the armies 
of the living and the dead is the 
show’s primary focus. For now, 
audiences will have to wait for 
any more clashes between the 
Lannisters and the Targaryens.

“The Dragon and the Wolf” also 

handled Theon Greyjoy’s (Alfie 
Allen, “John Wick”) meandering 
storyline well, inspiring viewers to 
root for the disgraced Greyjoy son 
again. After yet another season of 
a timid, spineless Theon, nearly 
all loyal “Thrones” supporters 
had given up hope of any sort 
of 
redemption 
from 
Theon. 

Flipping that narrative on its 
head, this season finale featured 
Theon summoning the courage 
to set out to rescue his sister 
Yara Greyjoy (Gemma Whelan, 
“The Wolfman”). In the process, 
Theon kills a fellow Ironborn in a 

barbaric fistfight that wins back 
the support of his soldiers and, by 
extension, “Thrones” fans.

This is one of the biggest 

strengths 
of 
“The 
Dragon 

and the Wolf” — it rewards 
“Thrones” viewers’ loyalty with 
outstanding pay-off scenes. For 
years, “Thrones” has teased that 
“Winter is coming,” and with it, 
the army of the dead. The finale 
portrayed winter’s arrival in grand 
through a snowy scene in King’s 
Landing with a breathtaking 
shot of the Wall collapsing, 
shredded with fireballs by a 
White Walker riding an undead 
dragon. Outside of these shots, 
“Thrones” gave audiences a Jon 
Snow (Kit Harington, “Pompeii”) 
and Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia 
Clarke, “Terminator Genisys”) 
sex scene after several episodes of 
subtle sexual tension.

As a “Thrones” season finale, 

“The Dragon and the Wolf” 
wouldn’t be complete without 
some 
last 
second 
plotline 

bombshell, 
and 
the 
episode 

fully delivers in this area. In the 
penultimate scene of the episode, 
fan-favorites Samwell Tarly (John 
Bradley, “Traders”) and Bran 
Stark (Isaac Hempstead-Wright, 
“The Boxtrolls”) learn of Jon’s 
true lineage as the son of Rhaegar 
Targaryen and Lyanna Stark. 
While the show has hinted at this 
revelation since its premiere, the 
discovery remains monumental 
by making Jon the true heir to the 
Iron Throne, though it also makes 
his relationship with Daenerys 
clearly incestal — she is his aunt. 
Having such a stunning reveal as 
only a minor piece of the stellar 
season finale is exactly what 
audiences have come to expect 
from “Thrones,” and it’s why they 
will keep returning to watch the 
series’s eighth and final season.

TBS breaks 2000s mold

Remember the last time you 

had a truly cathartic release at a 
concert — who was there and what 
songs you screamed. Nostalgia 
holds an undeniable power over 
musical experiences, but it can also 
become toxic when exploited in the 
present. In a world of never ending 
anniversary tour announcements, 
it’s refreshing to find a band stand 
out among the rest without the 
crutch of nostalgia. On August 13th, 
Taking Back Sunday lit the sold out 
Crofoot in Pontiac ablaze, setting 
the standard for early 2000s emo 
bands still fortunate enough to be 
playing shows.

Calling Taking Back Sunday 

an “emo band” in 2017 is a bit of a 
stretch. Coming off the release of 
2016’s incredible record Tidal Wave, 
the band has proven their ability 
for constructive change, making a 
record with an unprecedented rock 
atmosphere for the band without 
straying too far from what fans have 
come to expect of their music. Fully 
cognizant of their fanbase’s desires, 
Taking Back Sunday’s setlists 
actively engage all the eras of their 
music — frontman Adam Lazzara 
even took the time to explain the 
inclusion of “Everything Must 
Go,” a deep cut from their typically 
overlooked record New Again.

I’ve now seen Taking Back 

Sunday both pre- and post-Tidal 
Wave, and it’s safe to say the new 
material expertly blends with 
the old. Where contemporaries 
have begun to falter (see: literally 
all of Fall Out Boy’s music post-
reunion), the music on Tidal Wave 
fits perfectly with the rest of their 
catalogue included in their sets. 
Opening with the title track and 
throwing “Death Wolf” in the 
middle of the performance did 
nothing to dampen the energy; 
if anything changed, a marginal 
amount of people didn’t know all 
the words to sing along.

Now you find yourself halfway 

through Taking Back Sunday’s set. 
You’re out of breath and sweaty, 
packed like a sardine in the crowd 
of drunk young adults. None of this 
should be remotely comfortable, 
but you just finished dancing your 
ass off to the rock ‘n’ roll of “Death 
Wolf” when the band launches into 
the aching ballad of “You’re So Last 
Summer.” Without even thinking, 
you’re screaming, “Boys like you 
are a dime a dozen!” because that’s 
the infectious relationship Taking 
Back Sunday have with their fans.

Adam Lazzara and John Nolan 

are 
natural 
performers. 
They 

easily banter with each other, the 
rest of the band and even audience 
members. Anecdotes and jokes 
pass fluidly between songs, except 
for a long story on how Lazzara 

used to sing and dance in his 
kitchen pretending to be Billie Joe 
Armstrong before performing their 
toned-down acoustic cover of Green 
Day’s “She.” By sprinkling nostalgia 
here and there throughout the 
night, Taking Back Sunday kept 
long time fans emotionally engaged 
without the corniness of living in 
the past.

It’d be amiss to not mention 

Taking Back Sunday’s support 
from All Get Out and Every Time 
I Die. The former opened the show 
with their gorgeous and earnest alt-
punk tunes, while the later all but 
destroyed everybody that dared to 
enter the pit with their violent, high-
speed blend of hardcore and metal. 
With diverse, talented openers (and 
only two of them thankfully), the 
show quickly ramped up the energy 
before Taking Back Sunday even 
took the stage.

And this is exactly why Taking 

Back Sunday continues to thrive 
today. They’ve grown from their 
roots, branching into a band more 
beautiful, more diverse than their 
past without ignoring it. They 
didn’t miss a beat the entire night, 
bombarding 
the 
crowd 
with 

anthem after anthem, old and new. 
If Taking Back Sunday predicted 
anything on their first record, it’s 
that they will always have the mic 
and the crowd will always have the 
mosh pit.

Food, culture and 
code-switching

It’s not fun to say the 

words tandoori chicken. The 
dish itself is fine — a quite 
tasty preparation that’s been 
successfully 
imported 
and 

popularized in the US—but 
pronouncing the actual words, 
as an Indian-American kid, 
is kind of a chore. Same with 
vindaloo, or biryani, or Qatar, 
even. It’s that awkward choice 
you’re asked to a make in a 
split-second: do I say this the 
American, Anglicized way to 
make sure this conversation 
continues smoothly, or do I 
flex a little bit and pronounce 
this how it’s meant to be, 
thereby ensuring a slight but 
notable uptick in discomfort 
levels around the room?

But comparatively, tandoori 

is a walk in the park. My 
family is from Kerala, in the 
southernmost part of India, 
and our cuisine (and culture, 
for that matter), is wildly 
different than chicken tikka 
and paneer. It’s more seafood-
based, heavier on the coconut 
milk and bananas, and our 
vegetarian options are much 
more robust (for the sake of 
simplicity, we won’t dive into 
the varying branches based on 
religion). Along with a starkly 
different 
food 
landscape, 

however, is a language that 
is just as foreign, and so it 
is that saying the seemingly 
innocuous word dosa in front 
of a bunch of white people 
is 
a 
peculiarly 
stressful 

experience.

Try ordering idli off of 

a menu at your local South 
Indian vegetarian spot. Or 
pronouncing the word puttu 
without sounding like you’re 
mocking it. Maybe even take 
a stab at my last name! It’s a 

linguistic hellscape down here 
on the humid, rain-heavy tip 
of India, and for people who 
can’t roll their r’s or lay down a 
“hard t,” it’s nearly impossible 
to navigate.

Sure, this is an ostensibly 

stupid 
thing 
to 
complain 

about; the social anxiety of 
immigrants pronouncing meals 
on a menu is on par with “the 

people of Bomont not being 
allowed to dance” on the wide-
ranging scale of legitimate 
oppression. But what do you do 
when faced with the choice?

Let’s all agree that there’s no 

one worse than the dude who, 
in the middle of an otherwise 
normal description of food, 
decide 
to 
pronounce 
salsa 

verde as if he recently took 
a missionary trip to rebuild 
schools in Mexico. But for the 
immigrant —or, in this case, 
the first-generation child — to 
whitewash the pronunciation 
of your homeland’s food is 
odd, 
and 
uncomfortable. 

The history of that dish, and 
the history of your family, 
awkwardly brushed aside for 
convenience. There’s a tinge 
of guilt whenever you do it; it’s 
an internal acknowledgement 
that you have, for the moment, 
sold out to appease these white 
devils, even though you know 
better. It’s a microcosm of 
that age-old, tiresome cliché 

of a conundrum: to assimilate 
or to retain one’s heritage, all 
magnified by the order at a 
dinner table.

Code-switching is, on the 

whole, a much larger and 
more fascinating phenomenon 
to be considered. But in the 
context of food and its weirdly 
specific customs, it takes on a 
more dynamic meaning. For 
the foreigner, eating a plate 
of puttu and kadala curry 
(with your hands, of course) 
is, if for only a moment, a 
brief glimpse into a land miles 
away; for the immigrant, a 
banana leaf covered in the 

offerings of a traditional sadya 
— choru, aviyal, thoran, and 
countless more tiny mounds 
of 
exhaustively 
prepared 

side dishes — is an evocative 
snapshot of a phantom home, 
with all the emotional weight 
and cultural baggage that it 
portends. That split-second of 
hesitation, then — the moment 
before 
“doe-suh” 
or 
“tho-

shuh” — is often the wait of a 
lifetime.

WOMEN’S SOCCER
FIELD HOCKEY

Wolverines fall short at 
Notre Dame Invitational

Dowthwaite falls just short 
of giving Wolverines victory

After a 1-1 tie against Santa Clara 

(2-3-1) Friday, the No. 23 Michigan 
women’s soccer team was slated 
to face No. 11 South Carolina as its 
last opportunity to come out of the 
Notre Dame Invitational with a win. 
And for a brief moment, it looked 
like a possibility.

Just eight minutes into the game, 

junior forward Reilly Martin sent a 
free kick towards the Gamecocks’ 
goalkeeper, 
who 
managed 
to 

punch it away without an issue. But 
sophomore defender Jada Dayne 
was there to head the ball to the back 
of the net, giving the Wolverines an 
early 1-0 lead.

Michigan was eager to walk 

away with a win, but two second-
half goals from South Carolina (5-1) 
meant the Wolverines would leave 
the Notre Dame Invitational with a 
tie and a loss.

Trouble arose when Michigan 

(3-1-2) allowed two goals within a 
matter of minutes. The Wolverines 
maintained their one-goal lead 
through the first half, but in the 54th 
minute South Carolina’s midfielder 
Bianca 
Galassini 
collected 
a 

deflection in the box and slotted 
it in. Michigan struggled to keep 
its composure, and Galassini took 
advantage of a poor clearance and 
chipped it into the top right corner 
for her second goal of the day.

From 
there 
on 
out, 
the 

Gamecocks controlled the game. 
South 
Carolina 
dominated 

possession in its half of the field 
until the final whistle blew. The 
Wolverines didn’t even get their 
first shot of the second half until the 
75th minute, when redshirt junior 
forward Taylor Timko ripped a shot 
to the far-right post that sailed wide.

A quiet outing from junior 

midfielder Abby Kastroll surely 
impacted the Wolverines’ chances 

against the Gamecocks. Kastroll 
registered only one shot Sunday, 
where Friday she managed six shots 
and had the game-tying goal. She 
pressured Santa Clara’s backline, 
which 
allowed 
for 
freshman 

midfielder Sarah Stratigakis to send 
a through ball for Kastroll to tap in.

Michigan coach Greg Ryan 

doesn’t 
consider 
the 
weekend 

unsuccessful, though. With only 
one game left before conference 
play starts, Ryan knows the strong 
competition will prepare his team 
for what’s to come.

“We have a lot of younger players 

and this kind of experience is huge,” 
Ryan said. “We had the opportunity 
to play two teams that were in 
the Elite 8 last year of the NCAA 
Tournament, so I think this will 
help us face the top teams in the Big 
Ten.”

Still relatively early in the season, 

Ryan’s top priority is giving players 

as much playing time as possible. 
Two goalkeepers saw action this 
weekend, with senior Sarah Jackson 
starting 
Friday 
and 
freshman 

Hillary Beall starting Sunday. The 
two combined for nine saves on the 
weekend.

While Ryan was pleased with 

his team’s performance, there 
is still plenty of work to be done 
before the Big Ten season begins. 
Michigan started five freshmen in 
both games over the weekend, and 
its inexperience was evident. The 
defense was especially suspect as 
the Gamecocks’ two goals came off 
defensive errors.

With the goalkeeper position 

up in the air and new faces in the 
backline, the Wolverines now 
look to create a rhythm with their 
defense and hope the experience 
from beginning of the season was 
enough to garner a successful run in 
conference play.

The No. 11 Michigan field 

hockey team experienced its first 
snag of the year, losing 2-1 to No. 
4 Connecticut on Sunday in Ann 
Arbor after opening the season 
with three consecutive wins over 
ranked opponents. 

The contest was locked in an 

offensive stalemate for much of the 
game, with both teams remaining 
scoreless well into the second half.

“I think (Connecticut) had a 

really good one-on-one defense. 
They were very stingy coming 
into the circle, which gave us some 
trouble,” said Michigan coach 
Marcia Pankratz. “I think we 
tended to not have very good vision 
and had our heads down instead 
of transferring the ball around 
and penetrate another side of the 
circle. Those two things together 
probably didn’t make for a great 
day for us.”

The tie was broken by Huskie 

defender Casey Umstead on a 
corner shot with 15:08 remaining in 
the matchup. Umstead would tack 
on another goal on a penalty stroke 
less than four minutes later, giving 
Connecticut a 2-0 advantage.

The barrage of goals by the 

Huskies ultimately became the 
deciding factor in the game. With 11 
penalty corners to the Wolverines’ 
two, Connecticut was able to swing 
the balance with its ample amount 
of goal-scoring opportunities. 

“If you give them that many 

corners, they’re going to execute 
one or two here, eventually. And 
they did,” Pankratz said. “We need 
to have more opportunities on our 
end so we can even up the score, 
and weren’t able to do that.”

Despite the sudden flurry of 

Huskie goals, Michigan was able 
to tighten the margin with a corner 
goal from sophomore forward Meg 

Dowthwaite with 3:26 remaining. 
The goal was Dowthwaite’s fifth in 
four games. 

After finally getting on the 

scoreboard, the Wolverines kept 
high pressure into the waning 
seconds of the game. In the final 
minute of the game, the team 
had 
one 
last 
penalty-corner 

opportunity. But Michigan wasn’t 
able to convert, and Connecticut 
was able to run the clock out to 
preserve the victory. 

“You pick up energy when you 

get a corner; we hadn’t had a corner 
all game,” Dowthwaite said. “You 
get a goal and it lifts the mood 
again and you get more energy and 
more confidence. So we really tried 
to go really hard in that last five 
minutes. (We) got a corner at the 
end but we just couldn’t finish it, 
unfortunately.”

Signs of fatigue were apparent 

given a short turnaround from 
last Friday’s contest against No. 
25 Liberty. The Huskies had a 
full week of rest before Sunday’s 
matchup. 

Even 
with 
the 
loss, 
the 

Wolverines 
look 
to 
have 
a 

promising season ahead of them, 
with 
a 
resume 
that 
already 

includes a win over then-No. 1 
North Carolina. The team will look 
to bounce back this Friday against 
William & Mary. 

“The last four minutes (against 

Connecticut) was the team that 
was here on Friday and last 
weekend,” Pankratz said. “It took 
us 66 minutes to get there, so that 
was unfortunate. We’ll just have 
to try to work on that and fix it for 
the next weekend. It’s a long season 
and that’s why we play the games — 
to get better every game so we’re at 
our best at the end of the season.”

Patience paying off for Marshall
Mukuna proving value for Michigan

The 
last 
four 
years 
of 

Lawrence 
Marshall’s 
life 

have been all about trusting a 
process he never knew would 
take so long.

It’s a process that required 

nearly 50 pounds of weight 
gain, two position switches 
and three years of patiently 
waiting.

That 
process 
isn’t 
over 

yet. But, at least for one play, 
the redshirt junior caught a 
glimpse at what could lie in 
his future when he recovered 
a fumble in the third quarter 
of Michigan’s 33-17 victory 
over Florida on Saturday. 

“That’s what we preached 

all spring ball, all fall camp 
— just running to the ball,” 
Marshall said. “That’s the 
Michigan 
thing. 
Coaches 

always preach that; you never 
know what you’re going to 
find when you’re running to 
the ball.”

Marshall has yet to break 

into the starting lineup, or 
develop into the fearsome 
defensive lineman that many 
predicted he would. But given 
how long he’s waited to make 
an impact on the field, that 
fumble recovery meant all the 
more to both him and his mom, 
who Marshall said texted and 
called him “five or six times” 
after the game ended.

Marshall, now a defensive 

tackle, 
has 
certainly 
had 

a 
humbling 
experience 
at 

Michigan despite a recruiting 
pedigree that would suggest 
otherwise.

He arrived in Ann Arbor 

as a highly-touted four-star 
defensive end — one of the 
best in the nation — who had 
previously committed to Ohio 
State. Yet Marshall was not 
prepared for one of big-time 
college 
football’s 
harshest 

realities: chances are, the 
roster already has players who 

were just as highly-ranked as 
you were — and they have an 
advantage in experience. 

It 
didn’t 
matter 
that 

Marshall 
was 
a 
blue-chip 

recruit, or that Michigan had 
won a hard-fought recruiting 
battle for his services. Once he 
enrolled on campus, he was at 
the bottom.

“We 
just 
had 
some 

incredible players that were 
ahead of me, and I just had 
to wait my time,” Marshall 
said. “It was difficult, being a 
highly-recruited guy coming 
in and you’ve got to start 

from the bottom of the barrel 
and build your way up, but 
perseverance is everything 
and that’s what I stand by.”

It didn’t help that Marshall 

was quickly converted into a 
strongside end — a position 
that, 
compared 
to 
the 

weakside, typically requires 
more weight in an emphasis 
to hold up better against the 
run. Then, he was eventually 

moved again, this time to 
defensive tackle.

For Marshall, that meant 

retooling 
his 
entire 
pass-

rushing technique. And that 
didn’t come easy.

“A lot of work went into it,” 

Marshall said. “Rushing from 
the inside versus outside are 
two different games.” 

He gained an edge during 

the offseason, though, after 
working with fifth-year senior 
defensive tackle Mo Hurst. 
Hurst, commonly regarded 
as one of the nation’s premier 
interior pass-rushers, taught 
Marshall “everything.”

Those 
sessions, 
coupled 

with more time spent at the 
position, saw Marshall enjoy 
what he thinks is one of — if 
not the — best fall camps he’s 
ever had. 

“I’m more aggressive, I 

feel like — more knock ‘em 
back, playing low, my pad 
level has gotten way better, 
my technique has improved 
a lot,” Marshall said. “I was 
just watching film of myself 
my sophomore year where I 
was stepping inside some or 
stepping outside, and now it’s 
straight steps and punching 
somebody in the mouth first, 
so that’s what I felt like I 
improved the most on.”

Saturday, he saw regular 

snaps as part of the interior 
rotation. While that may not 
seem like much, Michigan 
spent much of the game in a 
three-man front, which meant 
there were fewer snaps for its 
interior linemen.

Perhaps 
that’s 
the 
best 

indicator of how far Marshall 
has come — while he was once 
the 
highly-touted 
recruit 

biding his time, he’s now the 
veteran seeing the field ahead 
of younger and even more 
highly-ranked freshmen.

“You have to be patient to a 

certain extent,” Marshall said. 
“I was patient all the way up to 
this point.”

Before Friday night, Daniel 

Mukuna doesn’t think he had 
ever scored two goals in a 
soccer match — no matter the 
playing level. 

The junior defender found 

the back of the net just three 
times last season at Campbell 
University, as offensive chances 
were simply scarce for the 
England native. 

But in just his third game 

as part of the Michigan men’s 
soccer team, Mukuna scored 
twice — including the eventual 
game-winner — to lead the 
Wolverines to a 3-1 victory over 
Cleveland State. 

“It means a lot to get those 

goals,” Mukuna said. “It’s a 
privilege for me to play here, 
and whenever there’s a chance 

to get a goal, I definitely want 
to be who comes up and gets 
one.

“I believed that these were 

the coaches that would take me 
to the next level – that’s why 
I transferred here. It’s great 
to see things come together 
tonight.”

Michigan 
coach 
Chaka 

Daley pushed Mukuna up the 
pitch, noting his ability in the 
air off set pieces. Despite a 
1-0 Michigan lead that forced 
the Vikings to increase their 
tempo in the attacking third, 

Daley returned fire with an 
aggressive approach that led to 
Mukuna’s first goal in the 55th 
minute — a buried header off 
a cross from senior midfielder 
Tristan Jacob. 

Just 
four 
minutes 
later, 

Mukuna completed his brace 
with a powerful finish from the 
right flank as the Wolverines 
continued to pressure on the 
offensive end. 

“Going in, we talked about 

getting goals from the back and 
how beneficial that would be,” 
Mukuna said. “There definitely 
was an emphasis on it, and it’s 
great to see it come to fruition.”

On 
the 
defensive 
half, 

Mukuna and his fellow starting 
backs – junior Marcello Borges 
and sophomore Abduo Samake 
— held the Vikings to just four 
shots. Though one of those 
found the back of the net, the 
trio 
consistently 
frustrated 

Cleveland State’s attackers with 
solid positioning and speed to 
cut off potential chances. 

“(Our defenders) have been 

a great partnership so far,” 
Mukuna 
said. 
“Everybody 

has been working thoroughly 
in practice on keeping our 
discipline 
and 
shape 
and 

making sure out tactics are 
right. 
I’m 
happy 
that 
it’s 

showing up on the field.”

Mukuna even found himself 

saving goals, too

When the Vikings opened 

the 
field 
in 
pursuit 
of 

equalizing goals in the 75th 
minute, Cleveland State forced 
sophomore goalkeeper Andrew 
Verdi out of position from an 
initial 
chance, 
creating 
an 

open net opportunity off the 
rebound. But Mukuna — almost 
100 meters from where he 
scored his two goals — blocked 
the Viking attempt to preserve 
Michigan’s two-goal lead.

Despite the return of junior 

Peter Brown, Mukuna has now 
started over the incumbent 
defender in all three matches. 

“Certainly, he’s a physical 

presence and has kept himself 
super fit,” Daley said. “He’s very 
much a team guy, is technically 
sound and very dangerous on 
dead ball situations. He’s been 
solid to this point.”

Meet Mr. Riddle 

By now, you’ve probably 

heard of the letter that 

inspired the Wolverines. Get 

to know the Marine who 

wrote it. 

 » Page 6B

Feelin’ special
Quinn Nordin and the special 
teams unit helped Michigan 
win a phase of the game 
Saturday that they were 
never supposed to. 

» Page 5B

The 11th-ranked Wolverines defeated No. 17 Florida at AT&T Stadium in the AdvoCare 
Classic, quieting any concerns there may have been that Michigan is too inexperienced.

ARLINGTON, Tex. — The 

first pick came, then the sec-
ond.

Suddenly, 
the 
Michigan 

football team was trailing by 
a touchdown with its start-
ing quarterback taking a seat 
on the sideline. Then came a 
blocked punt, and the game 
was at risk of spiraling out of 
control.

And yet, the 11th-ranked 

Wolverines (1-0) — a team 
ample 
with 
youth 
after 

returning, at best, five start-
ers 
— 
threw 
their 
inex-

perience out the window, 
recovering to score 20 sec-
ond-half points and defeat 
No. 17 Florida, 33-17, in the 
AdvoCare Classic at AT&T 
Stadium.

“I mean, we didn’t hang our 

heads,” said freshman wide 
receiver Tarik Black. “You 
know, when we face adversity, 

we just got to get back to it, 
get back up.

“Really, Coach just empha-

sized coming out and pretty 
much clearing our heads and 
just coming out and doing 
what we do, and that’s play 
Michigan 
football. 
And 
I 

think 
that’s 

what we did.”

The 
second-

half resurgence 
started 
with 

redshirt 
junior 

quarterback 
Wilton Speight, 
as he went 5-for-
7 with 52 yards 
to set up junior 
running 
back 

Karan 
Higdon 

for a three-yard 
touchdown rush 
on the opening 
drive.

Redshirt freshman kicker 

Quinn Nordin slowly built 
Michigan’s lead for the rest of 
the third quarter, nailing a 30 

and 50-yard field goal after 
two fumble recoveries to put 
the Wolverines ahead, 26-17, 
entering the final frame.

Then the defense took over, 

as it had the entire game.

Florida (0-1) failed to score 

a single point in the second 

half, 
eventu-

ally 
replacing 

Feleipe 
Franks 

with 
Malik 

Zaire at quar-
terback.

The 
Wolver-

ines’ 
defense 

tallied stop after 
stop — holding 
the 
Gators 
to 

just 192 yards, 
conceding 
just 

three points and 
capping the day 
off with a sack 
of 
Zaire 
that 

turned into a fumble recovery 
in Florida’s end zone.

“I seen a bunch of guys play 

like men today,” Bush said. “… 

We just had a bunch of guys 
rise to the occasion. I can’t 
express how happy I am and 
proud of those guys I am.”

And if not for the defensive 

unit, the first half could have 
easily gotten out of hand.

Though 
he 
eventually 

returned, 
line-

backer 
and 

defensive 
cap-

tain 
Mike 

McCray started 
the 
game 
on 

the sideline for 
unknown 
rea-

sons, and sopho-
more linebacker 
Devin Bush was 
nearly 
ejected 

for targeting on 
the first play of 
the game.

Roughly 
12 

minutes 
later, 

after finding freshman wide 
receiver Tarik Black for a 
46-yard touchdown to give 
Michigan a 10-3 lead with just 

over three minutes left in the 
first quarter — going 75 yards 
on three plays in just 43 sec-
onds — Speight’s day took a 
turn for the worse.

The Gators turned his two 

pick-sixes into a 17-13 lead, 
despite failing to score a 

single offensive 
touchdown and 
tallying just 91 
total yards in 
the first half.

And with the 

pick-sixes came 
the quarterback 
controversy. 
Michigan coach 
Jim 
Harbaugh 

went with Spei-
ght to start the 
game, but two 
consecutive 
interceptions 
landed him on 

the bench with just under 11 
minutes left in the first half.

Fifth-year 
senior 
John 

O’Korn took over, only to 

watch sophomore Will Hart 
have his punt blocked after 
O’Korn’s first offensive drive 
ended with a three and out.

O’Korn was given only one 

more offensive drive after 
the punt block, as Speight 
reclaimed his duties under 
center for the remainder 
of the game and finished 
11-for-25 with 181 yards, one 
touchdown and two inter-
ceptions.

“There’s a lot to learn from 

it,” Harbaugh said. “There’s 
really good things to learn 
from it. We already have talk-
ed about some of them, and 
there will be more to learn 
from it. But he’s experiencing 
it. That’s big.

“And then, you know, it’s 

always astonished me, you 
know, with quarterbacks. It’s 
a sign. It really is a sign when 
a quarterback can have some-
thing really bad go, some-
thing really bad happen, and 
come back from it.”

A letter and a lesson

A

RLINGTON, Tex. — 
Dear Coach Harbaugh,

The letter began.

My name is Anthony Riddle; 

I’m a 13-year combat veteran of 
the U.S. Marine Corps. I now 
live just thirty minutes west of 
Ann Arbor in 
Jackson, MI.

Michigan’s 

football coach 
kept reading.

The reason 

for this letter 
is for the last 
three months 
I have heard 
how young 
this year’s 
team is, how 
inexperienced the team is, how 
many players we have to replace, 
or lost to the NFL.

Then came the real point.
Let me be clear that sort of 

criticism is bullshit.

The night before the 

11th-ranked Wolverines’ 33-17 
victory over No. 17 Florida, 
Harbaugh shared Riddle’s 
message with his team — 
joking that it was “better than 
anything I could have told 
(them).”

With the way Michigan 

played, maybe it was.

Ever since the Wolverines 

lost to Florida State in the 
Orange Bowl on Dec. 30, 
the question has been how 
Michigan would fare after 
losing all but one starter on the 
defensive side of the ball.

Saturday, the Wolverines 

trotted out a defensive lineup 
with seven first-time starters 
and gave a definitive answer.

Florida managed just 181 

yards in the air, and — even 
more uninspiring — rushed for 
just 11 yards. The Gators totaled 
just 11 first downs, not including 
penalty yardage.

Michigan forced four fumbles 

and recovered three, the final 
of which was a touchdown that 

proved to be a dagger in the 
game’s final two minutes.

Sophomore linebacker Devin 

Bush Jr. led the unit with seven 
tackles, two sacks and three 
tackles for loss. Junior safety 
Tyree Kinnel wasn’t far behind, 
racking up six tackles and 1.5 for 
loss — each good for second on 
the team. That’s not bad for two 
guys making the first starts of 
their careers.

It’s even more impressive 

considering the hand they 
were dealt. Michigan’s defense 
allowed just three points the 
entire game. And yet, the 
Gators held a 17-13 advantage at 
halftime, due to redshirt junior 
quarterback Wilton Speight’s 
two pick-sixes in the second 

quarter.

In moments like that, when 

a team is losing a game it has 
no business losing, youth 
conventionally 
crumbles. The 
Wolverines’ 
response was 
anything but.

“After those 

two picks, 
you know, we 
didn’t go in the 
gutter,” Bush 
said. “We didn’t 
start pointing 
fingers. Our 
job is to get us out of this hole. 
… As a team, you got to pick the 
offense up when they need help. 
So that’s what we all did.”

And when pushed further, 

asked if he was at all worried 
after the interceptions, Bush 
spoke without hesitation — 

“Nah.”

Cool. 

Confident. 
And for an 
inexperienced 
team, 
unconventional.

As for the 

offensive side of 
the ball, it was the 
same story.

The Wolverines 

racked up 215 

yards on the ground, and 
another 218 through the air. 
They did so with seven players 
making their first career starts 

at their respective positions.

Freshman wide receiver 

Tarik Black and redshirt 
freshman tight end Nick 
Eubanks handled their new 
receiving responsibilities 
with the poise of veterans — 
combining for 144 yards on four 
receptions.

And though he played plenty 

last year, sophomore running 
back Chris Evans took his 
first start in stride, leading 
Michigan’s backs with 22 
carries while notching 88 yards.

When it was all said and 

done, the Wolverines left the 
field with a victory to show for 
it. Undoubtedly, mistakes were 
made. Two of them came from 
a veteran in Speight, while the 

other — a punt block — was a 
special teams gaffe. Michigan 
still walked away with a 
16-point advantage, and youth 
was far from the problem. 

After the game, Speight and 

Harbaugh shared the story 
of the letter. Then Harbaugh 
handed it out for all to see. The 
Wolverines’ coach didn’t equate 
football to war, but he thought 
Riddle’s message resonated 
nonetheless.

Riddle went on to write 

about his experience serving 
in Iraq, about being handed 
the responsibility — at 20 years 
old — of leading 52 Marines into 
battle, all of whom were the 
same age or younger.

He told Harbaugh how every 

member of that unit completed 
their mission and returned 
safely. He told Harbaugh that 
if his unit could do that, at 20, 
in war, then this Michigan 
group could win a Big Ten 
championship, if not a national 
championship.

It’s way too early to say that 

Saturday was any justification 
of a championship-caliber 
team. But it was certainly a 
justification of Riddle’s first 
point: Against the Gators, the 
concerns about youth were, in 
fact, “bullshit.”

Speight highlighted a simple 

fact in the bowels of AT&T 
Stadium. Last year, Michigan’s 
roster was made up of a 
collection of 22- and 23-year-
olds. This year, the Wolverines 
have a bunch of 18- and 19-year 
olds.

What everyone saw Saturday 

was that it really didn’t matter. 
There wasn’t a single Wolverine 
for whom the stage was too 
bright.

As Bush bluntly put it: “Young 

don’t mean nothin’.”

Sophomore linebacker Devin Bush Jr. and sophomore defensive end Rashan Gary showed that concerns of Michigan’s youth were unfounded after all.

“Let me be 

clear that sort 
of criticism is 

bullshit.”

On big stage, Bush showcases star potential

ARLINGTON, Tex. — The final 

scene of a football game, as the fans 
stream out of the stadium and the 
teams congregate in the middle of the 
field, can tell you everything you need 
to know.

On Saturday, all one needed to 

do was watch Devin Bush Jr. as he 
waded through masses of Michigan 
and Florida players following his 
team’s dominating — yet oddly close 

— 33-17 victory.

Bush, a sophomore linebacker 

making the first start of his career, 
was treated like a star. He took several 
interviews with reporters from ESPN 
and other outlets.

He met and took pictures with 

Florida players, with his teammates, 
all with a giant smile on his face. 
And then, quite fittingly, he ran off 
the field in lockstep with defensive 
coordinator Don Brown, who raised 
his hand in the air and brought it 
down to meet Bush’s, as if he was 

about to signal, ‘This is the champ.’

Yes, Devin Bush Jr. was the champ 

Saturday. His name may not have 
been known to the larger world of 
college football before Saturday 
afternoon — but just like a movie 
star becomes famous after their first 
leading role, Bush will be known to 
many now.

Yet it was a performance that was 

nearly derailed before it even began. 
Bush, who has already been ejected 
once in his career before, was flagged 
for a late hit on the first snap of the 

game. The officials went to review, 
the players to their huddles, and Bush 
awaited his fate. It would have been 
a big blow to the defense, especially 
considering how definitively Bush 
won the starting competition at 
middle linebacker.

But Bush didn’t seem to worry 

about the outcome too much, 
considering his comments after the 
game.

“I don’t remember,” Bush said. 

“But if I wanted to say, like, it’s just me. 
That’s just what I do. If they want to 

eject me, eject me.”
That mindset — of unbridled 

aggressiveness and ferocity on every 
snap, regardless of whether it’s 
on defense or special teams — fits 
well with Michigan’s defense and 
with Brown’s scheme. Bush and his 
coordinator, it seems, were meant for 
each other.

That’s not to say the player Bush 

replaced in the middle — Ben Gedeon 
— was shabby. Gedeon played well 
last year and was drafted in the 
fourth round of the NFL Draft, in 
fact. But Bush is the type of prospect 
Michigan fans have been longing for, 
a player who has the requisite speed 
and agility to play sideline to sideline 
and disrupt plays in a manner that his 
predecessors couldn’t quite do. 

Bush, to put it simply, looked like a 

heat-seeking missile, if a heat-seeking 
missile could play middle linebacker. 
Time after time, he shot into the 
backfield on well-timed blitzes, or 
snuffed out the rare Florida ball 
carrier that got past his defensive line. 
He led the team in tackles with seven. 
He led the team with tackles-for-loss 
with three. He led the team in sacks 
with two.

It was the type of performance 

that might indicate that Michigan’s 
defense may not have lost much of a 
step, despite last year’s departures.

And that’s the larger point that 

Michigan wants to make, the message 
it’s been trying to tell everyone all 
offseason: The Wolverines may have 
lost a lot, but the players stepping in 
this year can do just as well — if not 
better. Just ask Devin Bush Jr.

Five Things We Learned: Florida

Yes, things didn’t go perfectly. But, 

all things considered, Michigan’s 
33-17 victory over Florida in the 
season opener at AT&T Stadium was 
a win the Wolverines could be proud 
of. For some reason, Jim Harbaugh 
just seems to have Jim McElwain’s 
number. Now, a young Michigan 
team whose main detriment may 
be inexperience can finally say it’s a 
little less inexperienced — especially 
after a top-25 win at a neutral-site 
venue.

Here are five things we learned 

from Saturday’s game:

1. There isn’t a quarterback 

controversy

Yes, Wilton Speight did get 

benched following the rarest of 
occurrences — consecutive pick-
sixes, of which only the latter was 
his fault. Harbaugh said after the 
game that he wanted his starting 
quarterback to ‘reset’ mentally.

The move seemed to pay off: 

Speight’s first drive of the second 
half saw him complete 5-of-7 passes 
for 52 yards and lead Michigan 
down the field for a touchdown that 
allowed it to reclaim the lead.

“I thought Wilton did a good job 

of getting calmed down and started 
off hot and then hit the rough patch,” 
Harbaugh said, “and then really 
finished strong and led our offense 
very well.”

Of 
course, 
Harbaugh 
never 

benched Speight when he struggled 
last year, and John O’Korn did look 
better than he has in the past when 
he ran the offense for two series. But 
there isn’t any debate: Speight is — 
and will be — Michigan’s starting 
quarterback for the foreseeable 
future, and deserves to be so.

While many might point to the 

interception on which he badly 
overthrew junior receiver Grant 
Perry, Speight did just fine — and 
better than just fine occasionally. 
There was the 46-yard touchdown 
pass to freshman receiver Tarik 
Black, or the numerous completions 
in the short passing game where he 

took what Florida’s defense gave 
him, or the late deep ball to redshirt 
freshman tight end Nick Eubanks. 
Speight even showed promise on one 
of his late miscues — an overthrow of 
what would’ve been a touchdown — 
by audibling into the play in the first 
place.

Perhaps the best indicator of 

what type of player Speight is, and 
can be on a more consistent basis, 
was his 28-yard pass to junior wide 
receiver Grant Perry on the opening 
drive of the third quarter. Perry was 
between two defenders, but Speight 
threaded the needle and placed his 
throw perfectly. It was a tough play, 
even more so considering Speight 
had been benched just before. The 
throw, and Speight’s willingness 
and capability to bounce back after a 
couple tough breaks, could certainly 
portend good things for the future.

2. The defense looks elite once 

again

The game was never more than 

nine points out of distance for Florida 
until the final few minutes, but those 
nine might as well have been 50 
considering how stifling Michigan’s 
defense was.

This was a unit that lost nine to 

10 starters from last year — and yet, 
somehow, looks like it hasn’t taken 
a step back at all. The Wolverines 
looked eerily similar to last year’s 
elite unit as they swarmed to the 
ball, created havoc in the backfield 
and imposed their will on Florida’s 
offense.

The stats tell it all: the Gators 

passed for just 133 yards and ran for 
a measly 11 yards. There were several 
chunk plays given up by the young 
secondary, but Florida was unable to 
capitalize and turn any of them into 
points besides a 34-yard pass on the 
first drive that led to a field goal.

But that unit will have time to 

mature over the year, and the Big 
Ten will never be confused with 
the Big 12. There aren’t many elite 
passing attacks that Michigan will 
see this year.

And even if the secondary does 

experience more growing pains, 
realistically, that won’t matter if the 

front seven is making life hell for the 
opposing quarterback and offensive 
line anyway.

3. Michigan looks deep at 

running back

Sophomore Chris Evans earned 

the majority of carries, rushing 22 
times for 78 yards. But the two other 
running backs to find playing time — 
fifth-year senior Ty Isaac and junior 
Karan Higdon — certainly played 
like they were the feature back as 
well.

Isaac received 11 carries and 

turned those into a productive 114 
yards. He ripped off several long 
runs, including a 36-yarder on 
Michigan’s first drive of the game. 
Perhaps most impressive was an 
18-yard scamper on a fourth-and-
one that showed the ability that 
made Isaac so coveted as a five-star 
recruit: He picked up the first down 
easily, bouncing outside, before 
displaying agility unnatural for his 
size by juking a safety and tacking on 
another 10-plus yards.

Higdon, meanwhile, toted the ball 

just seven times, but made the most of 
every carry. His speed was apparent 
on one play when he bounced the ball 
outside and outran a defensive back to 
the first-down marker.

Former running backs coach 

Tyrone 
Wheatley 
showed 
a 

predilection 
towards 
giving 

other backs carries even with an 
undisputed starter in De’Veon Smith 
last year. And from the looks of it, 
Jay Harbaugh — the position group’s 
current coach — may do the same 
with this year’s rotation and with 
similar success.

4. Young tight ends could be 

special

While 
redshirt 
junior 
Ian 

Bunting and redshirt sophomore 
Tyrone Wheatley Jr. are the most 
experienced members at tight end 
and earned their fair share of snaps 
Saturday, it was two of their younger 
running mates in sophomore Sean 
McKeon and redshirt freshman 
Nick Eubanks who flashed the most 
potential.

McKeon caught three passes, 

second-most on the team, for 25 

yards, proving to be a reliable option 
in the short and play-action passing 
game for Speight. He runs well 
for his size and showcased good 
balance, breaking a tackle to rumble 
his way for a first down. Perhaps 
most tantalizing for Michigan’s 
coaches was his blocking: McKeon 
consistently executed his assignment 
in the run game, helping pave holes 
for his running backs. Blocking can 
be the hardest aspect of the position 
to grasp — even former All-American 
and Mackey Award winner Jake Butt 
struggled with it at times — which 
makes 
McKeon’s 
performance 

all the more impressive. If he can 
be effective in both phases of the 
position, that gives his coaching staff 
flexibility; they won’t be tipping run 
or pass whenever they put McKeon 
in the game.

His counterpart, Eubanks, looks 

more like a receiver. But if you’re 
going to look like a receiver at tight 
end, you’re going to have to play like 

one, and Eubanks certainly did so.

In the fourth quarter, he lined up 

as the tight end, ran down the seam 
past a defensive back after Speight 
faked a handoff, and then reeled in a 
difficult over-the-shoulder catch as 
two Gators tried to break the pass up.

Eubanks had a reputation as a 

recruit for being raw — he played a 
lot of receiver in high school — but 
immensely talented. It was thought 
he would take a couple years to 
develop mentally and physically. 
Saturday — when Eubanks finished 
as 
Michigan’s 
second-leading 

receiver — suggested he may be 
progressing 
faster 
than 
many 

anticipated. 
Couple 
that 
with 

McKeon’s ability and the veterans, 
and Michigan’s tight end group 
could do better in replacing Butt 
better than initially expected.

5. Bold prediction: Tarik Black 

finishes as Michigan’s leading 
receiver

Former star Mario Manningham’s 

2005 season remains the gold 
standard for freshman campaigns 
in Ann Arbor — and he tallied just 
27 receptions for 433 yards and six 
touchdowns, a relatively modest 
season by most standards.

Tarik Black, though, appears 

poised to break that record and 
more. After earning praise from 
teammates and coaches all offseason, 
Black was finally able to prove that 
his performance on the field could 
match the considerable amount 
of hype. He led Michigan with 83 
receiving yards and one touchdown 
Saturday, hauling in a pair of deep 
balls. He displayed a willingness to 
block, ran crisp routes and was able 
to win one-on-one matchups.

Given the opportunities Black 

should receive as one of the 
starting outside receivers, it’s more 
than safe to say he should break 
Manningham’s record. And, judging 
from Saturday, it seems like he’ll be 
Michigan’s No. 1 option this year.

The good, the bad and the ugly: Florida

ARLINGTON, Tex. — One 

win into the Michigan football 
season has revealed so, so much. 
We learned who is starting at 
almost every position, where the 
team needs to improve and who 
has upped their game since the 
Wolverines (1-0) last played in 
2016.

After Michigan’s 33-17 win over 

Florida (0-1), coach Jim Harbaugh 
talked about a season opener filled 
with both highs and lows. The 
Daily breaks down the Wolverines’ 
turnaround victory over the Gators 
at AT&T Stadium:

The good
Most 
importantly, 
redshirt 

junior quarterback Wilton Speight 
bounced back after a devastating 
stretch of drives that resulted in 
two pick-sixes. Harbaugh took 
Speight out to calm him down, 
and after a couple of unconvincing 
drives 
from 
fifth-year 
senior 

John O’Korn, Speight returned 
to command the game. The 
Wolverines scored 20 unanswered 
points and tallied 230 yards of 
total offense in the second half. 
The game could play a major role 

in Speight’s development moving 
forward.

Looking more specifically at the 

position groups, wherever on the 
field Michigan graduated players, 
somebody new stepped up. The 
defensive linemen and linebackers 
looked almost as good as last year. 
The D-line of sophomore Rashan 
Gary, fifth-year senior Maurice 
Hurst, senior Chase Winovich 
and senior Bryan Mone pressured 
Florida’s offense all game.

At the start of the game, the 

Wolverines’ defense had zero 
players on the field that started 
for Michigan last year. Fifth-year 
senior linebacker Mike McCray 
watched from the sideline, to the 
surprise of many. He eventually 
entered the game, but the young 
linebacker unit, including Devin 
Bush (seven total tackles with two 
sacks) and Devin Gil (one tackle), 
was playing well anyway.

Michigan’s 
defense 
allowed 

just 11 rushing yards and only 
gave up three points Saturday. It 
even capped the game off with a 
touchdown of its own after forcing 
Florida’s quarterback to fumble in 
the end zone.

On the other side of the ball, 

Michigan’s 
offensive 
position 

players proved they are ample with 
depth. At running back, sophomore 
Chris Evans, fifth-year senior Ty 
Isaac and junior Karan Higdon 
combined for 231 rushing yards. 
The trio helped the Wolverines 
escape a handful of tricky third-
and-long scenarios, and Higdon 
also notched his first touchdown of 
the season.

Sophomore tight ends Nick 

Eubanks 
and 
Sean 
McKeon 

displayed their speed and catching 
ability in the second half. McKeon 
made three catches for 25 yards, 
and Eubanks made two catches 
for 61 yards, all of which came in 
the second half. The tight ends 
combined well to fill the hole left 
by former All-American Jake Butt.

The receiving core is also solid. 

Starting for Michigan this year 
are sophomore Kekoa Crawford, 
freshman Tarik Black and junior 
Grant Perry. Crawford’s day was 
uneventful, but Perry made four 
catches for 46 yards, and Black 
made two for 83. Freshman 
Donovan Peoples-Jones got into 
the mix as well, but for now it 
seems like he’ll mostly be used to 
return punts.

Finally, 
it’s 
impossible 
to 

evaluate 
Michigan’s 
scoring 

weapons without looking at its 
newest kicker, sophomore Quinn 
Nordin. Nordin, who originally 
committed to Penn State, flipped 
and committed to Ann Arbor after 
Harbaugh slept over at his house a 
few years ago. The efforts clearly 
paid off. Nordin went 4-6 on field 
goals against Florida, hitting a 
50-yarder and a 55-yarder in the 
process.

The bad
The offensive line returned 

just two of five starters, senior left 
tackle Mason Cole and sophomore 
left 
guard 
Ben 
Bredeson. 

Unsurprisingly, the left side of the 
line looked just fine in protecting 
Speight’s blind side. The right side, 
however, struggled to contain 
Florida’s imposing defensive ends. 
The Gators sacked Michigan’s 
quarterbacks five times Saturday.

Harbaugh complimented the 

new starters on the O-line after the 
game, including fifth-year senior 
center Patrick Kugler, sophomore 
right guard Michael Onwenu and 
redshirt sophomore right tackle 
Nolan Ulizio. Redshirt sophomore 
Jon Runyan also stepped in for a 
few downs at right tackle.

Harbaugh 
emphasized 
the 

importance of improving on the 
offensive line from week one to 
week two, and that playing against 
Michigan’s strong defensive line 
throughout fall camp has helped 
them progress.

The ugly
The obvious choice here is 

Speight’s two interceptions. The 
first pick, though, may not have 
been as bad as the ensuing Florida 
touchdown 
seemed. 
Speight 

actually threw a pretty decent 
pass, but receiver Kekoa Crawford 
couldn’t corral the ball, and ending 
up batting it straight up for the 
Gators’ secondary to pick off. 
Speight’s second pick-six, though, 
was worse. He sailed a pass well 
over Perry’s head right to a Florida 
cornerback who easily strolled into 
the end zone.

Speight has thrown some big 

interceptions before — two against 
Ohio State and one on his first pass 
in the season opener in 2016. The 
Wolverines can’t afford those kinds 
of mistakes if they want to get over 
the hump this year and compete 
for a Big Ten championship.

Michigan’s defense looked like it hasn’t lost a step since last year in the season-opener against the Gators. 

FOOTBALL
Black, Isaac boost
Michigan’s offense

ARLINGTON, Tex. — Tarik 

Black’s name had been tossed 
around plenty throughout the 
offseason.

Talk of an “electric, young” 

wide receiver buzzed about, 
but questions remained as to 
if he — or any of the receivers 
— could step up and replace 
Michigan’s leading wideouts 
from 2016.

Saturday 
afternoon 

at 
AT&T 
Stadium, 
Black 

answered the call in his first 
career game, as the No. 11 
Michigan football team (1-0) 
beat No. 17 Florida, 33-17.

Early on, with the game 

tied 
at 
three 
and 
the 

Wolverines’ offense deep in 
Gator territory, Black lined 
up to the left. His matchup 
was another true freshman, 
Florida 
cornerback 
Marco 

Wilson.

Michigan snapped the ball, 

and Black ran 10 yards down 
and in, 10 yards down and 
out and then cut in one last 
time. He’d completely shaken 
off 
Wilson 
and 
streaked 

unguarded to the end zone.

Redshirt junior quarterback 

Wilton 
Speight 
threw 
a 

lofty pass, landing it right in 
Black’s arms. It was Black’s 
first career reception, and a 
46-yard touchdown at that.

“I was a little nervous,” 

Black said of the play. “I used 
to play in front of a hundred 
people, now I play in front of 
100,000. It was pretty nerve-
wracking, but as long as you 
just focus and look at the ball 
all the way in, you should be 
fine.”

The play call also signaled 

that Michigan’s new passing 
game 
coordinator, 
Pep 

Hamilton, can adjust well on 
the fly.

On the prior play, Florida’s 

senior safety Nick Washington 

left the game with an injury. 
Replacing him on Black’s side 
of the field was another true 
freshman, 
defensive 
back 

Shawn Davis.

Michigan’s 
coaching 

staff recognized the Gators’ 
inexperienced secondary, and 
attacked it to perfection.

Black ended the day with 

83 receiving yards, looking 
very 
sure-handed 
for 
the 

Wolverines.

Michigan’s other offensive 

standout 
was 
fifth-year 

senior 
running 
back 
Ty 

Isaac. 
Sophomore 
Chris 

Evans earned the start, but 
when Evans struggled, Isaac 
stepped in to settle the nerves 
and 
ultimately 
made 
the 

biggest impact.

Isaac ran for 114 yards on 11 

carries Saturday, highlighted 
by a 36-yard gain to help 
Michigan 
escape 
a 
third-

and-13 situation in the first 
quarter.

“We 
called 
some 
off-

schedule third-down runs… 
and we were able to pick 
those up through the running 
game,” Harbaugh said. “Ty 
Isaac did a great job, so really 
happy for him. That really 
gave us a boost.”

Isaac’s performance marked 

his first 100-yard rushing 
game since 2015. Consistency 
has been an issue for him 
ever 
since 
he 
transferred 

to Michigan from Southern 
California after his freshman 
year. But a running back 
rotation with Isaac, Evans and 
junior Karan Higdon provides 
quality depth for Michigan 
in case one of them struggles 
to perform. Saturday was 
evidence of such.

Isaac 
and 
Black 
were 

instrumental 
in 
sparking 

Michigan’s 
433 
yards 
of 

total offense, quieting any 
questions about ‘filling gaps 
from 2016’ at the running 
back or receiver slots.

Notebook: Harbaugh praises offensive line

Long third downs can be 

an offense’s worst nightmare. 
The defense often sells out 
against the pass, making it all 
the more difficult to convert 
long completions. In Michigan’s 
33-17 victory over Florida, the 
Wolverines faced one of those 
situations during their opening 
drive when a sack forced a third-
and-13 from Michigan’s 48-yard 
line.

The Wolverines, though, went 

against convention, calling a 
draw play that sprung loose fifth-
year senior running back Ty 
Isaac for 36 yards.

The 
draw 
play 
worked 

perfectly as what Jim Harbaugh 
calls an ‘off-schedule’ run — 
where Michigan runs the ball 
in a passing scenario to try to 
catch the opponent off guard. 
And Isaac, who rushed 11 times 
for 114 yards, was the beneficiary 
twice, converting another long 
third down on a similar play in 
the third quarter.

“It’s in the scheme,” Isaac 

said Monday. “We look at a lot 
of film, obviously the coaches 
know what they’re doing when 
they’re drawing up plays. There 
were a couple situations where 
we got the looks that we were 
expecting to get, which made it a 
little easier.

“They know what they’re 

doing. I’ll never doubt my own 
abilities, so it could be third-
and-30 and if they call my 
number, I feel like I’m going to go 
get it. We practice certain things, 
we do a lot of situational work 
in practice, so it goes back to 
knowing the type of looks we’re 
going to get for the most part.”

While Isaac led the team 

in rushing yards, sophomore 
Chris Evans — the starter — still 
received double the amount of 
carries with 22. But Isaac is okay 
with however many touches he 
gets. He said he simply wants 
to have an impact on the game, 

whether that’s with three or 11 
or 20 carries. And his continued 
improvement 
with 
limited 

carries certainly caught his head 
coach’s eye.

“Ty has been a very elusive 

runner,” Harbaugh said. “He’s 
been outstanding. I think his pass 
protection has improved greatly, 
he’s always been a great catcher 
of the ball and his instincts are 
good and improving.”

Harbaugh 
pleased 
with 

offensive line

While an outside glance at the 

stats — five sacks and 11 tackles-
for-loss given up — might indicate 
Michigan’s young offensive line 
had a rough afternoon against 
Florida’s front seven, Harbaugh 
was pleased with what he saw 
from his starters. 

He’s mentioned before that he 

thinks the line is more athletic 
than previous units. On Monday, 
he compared the new group to 
last year’s line, which featured 
three senior starters.

“There were times consistently 

during the season last year 
where we were getting beat and 
there were free runners on the 
quarterback, and there was a 
lot less of that in this ball game 

against a very good defensive 
line and linebacker corps where 
they’re fast,” Harbaugh said. “We 
were getting them blocked. We 
were moving our feet. It wasn’t 
perfect, but it’s a good place to 
be, and glad we’re at that level. 
You don’t know where you’re 
going to be exactly until you play 
your first game, and we’re at a 
good level. We can improve from 
here.”

All three of the new starters — 

fifth-year senior center Patrick 
Kugler, sophomore right guard 
Mike 
Onwenu 
and 
redshirt 

sophomore right tackle Nolan 
Ulizio — earned praise from 
Harbaugh for their efforts. He 
was especially pleased with 
Onwenu, who won the starting 
job this offseason after losing 
weight at the request of the 
coaching staff.

“Very 
happy 
with 
Mike 

Onwenu,” Harbaugh said. “You 
go into it and you think, ‘Okay, 
Mason Cole is our best offensive 
lineman, and then Ben Bredeson 
right there close. Mike Onwenu 
or Ben Bredeson, who’s better?’ 
They’re both ascending, and 
Mike’s ascending real fast.”

Nordin earns award after 

first start

Redshirt 
freshman 
kicker 

Quinn Nordin arrived on the 
college football scene in a big 
way Saturday. He hit his first four 
field goals, setting a program 
record by converting two field 
goals of 50 yards or more in one 
game, and even went viral for his 
haircut imitating Ricky “Wild 
Thing” Vaughn from the popular 
1989 film Major League.

His breakout performance saw 

him named co-Big Ten Special 
Teams Player of the Week on 
Monday, sharing the award with 
Maryland’s Antoine Brooks. 

“He’s 
got 
a 
great 
leg,” 

Harbaugh 
said. 
“There’s 
no 

question about it. We worked 
very hard. You’ve got to give 
Cameron Cheeseman a lot of 
credit, you’ve got to give Garrett 
Moores a lot of credit, I mean, 
that whole battery. It’s a battery. 
Two out of the three gotta go 
really well to make a kick. One 
of the three go wrong, you’re not 
going to make the kick. So that 
team effort was good. 

“I think (Nordin) responds to 

the moment and the pressure. 
I think he’s got that wonderful 
quality about him.”

Michigan cruises by 
Cleveland State, 3-1

Last season, the term “routine 

win” didn’t seem to exist in the 
vocabulary of the Michigan men’s 
soccer team.

But perhaps, as a new team 

starts to find its form, it may just 
shed that reputation as well.

Though the Wolverines were 

missing two key playmakers due 
to injury — junior forward Francis 
Atuahene and freshman forward 
Mohammad Zakyi — they made 
a routine game look, well, routine, 
taking care of non-conference foe 
Cleveland State, 3-1, to improve to 
2-0-1 on the season.

Neither injury is considered 

to be long term, according to 
Michigan coach Chaka Daley, 
who was hopeful both Atuahene 
and Zakyi would be ready to 
return 
for 
Monday’s 
match 

against Dartmouth.

In their absence, however, the 

Wolverines found offense from 
other sources.

In the 50th minute, junior 

forward Jack Hallahan ended 
the stalemate with a goal worthy 
of SportsCenter highlight reels. 
With the ball at his feet just 
in front of the midfield line, 
Hallahan looked up to see the 
goalkeeper off his line. With 
several defenders surrounding 
him, Hallahan calmly chipped 
the ball over the backtracking 
keeper’s outstretched arm.

“I saw (the goalkeeper) off his 

line, I looked around and didn’t 
see a pass,” Hallahan said. “And I 
go for it. See what happens.”

Hallahan admitted that such an 

audacious attempt isn’t something 
the forward would ever practice, 
but compared the shot to a long 
pass towards the net.

From there, the floodgates 

opened, as the Vikings’ defense 
started to open up.

In the span of the next 10 

minutes, junior defender Daniel 

Makuna — a typically unlikely 
source for goals — netted two in 
quick succession, all but sealing 
the result. 

The first came in the 55th 

minute, when senior midfielder 
Tristan Jacob found the ball at his 
feet on the left wing and swung a 
quick ball into the box. Mukuna 
lunged forward, heading the ball 
past the diving goalkeeper.

Mukuna scored his second 

just four minutes later, when 
Hallahan’s cross found Mukuna 
once again, who made no 
mistake in powering the ball 
into the net. 

Cleveland State pulled a goal 

back in the 70th minute, but the 
effort was too little too late for the 
Vikings, as the Wolverines calmly 
saw the game out from there.

Though Michigan dominated 

possession early, it struggled 
to find that elusive first goal. 
Heading into halftime, though, 
Daley never doubted his offense 
would ultimately break through.

“I wouldn’t say we struggled 

to generate chances (in the first 
half), we just struggled to hit the 
target,” Daley said. “At halftime 
we just told the guys to keep doing 
what we’re doing, don’t lose focus 
defensively. Continue to keep 
things locked down, and give the 
team a chance.”

Last season, dominant shot 

totals and controlling possession 
was hardly out of the norm. 
What this team showed a glimpse 
of 
Friday, 
was 
a 
newfound 

propensity to convert those into 
goals.

“I thought it was a good team 

performance, from start to finish,” 
Daley said. “I thought defensively 
we were sound, and attacking 
wise it took us a little while, but 
certainly we broke it open when 
we broke it open.

“Certainly pleased for tonight, 

and back to work tomorrow.”

It was a different tone from 

Daley, almost routine.

MEN’S SOCCER

Atuahene’s late goal pushes 
Wolverines past Dartmouth

For a while, it looked like last 

season all over again for the 
Michigan men’s soccer team.

Huge advantages in shots and 

possession weren’t enough to 
carry the Wolverines in 2016, and 
for 80 minutes Monday it was the 
same case against Dartmouth.

But then, Michigan did what 

it was unable to do on so many 
occasions a year ago. With 
eight 
minutes 

to play, junior 
forward Francis 
Atuahene 
took 

a 
pass 
from 

sophomore 
forward 
Jack 

Hallahan, 
created 
space 

in the box and 
slotted the ball 
into the bottom-
right corner of 
the net, giving the Wolverines 
(3-0-1) a 1-0 victory over the Big 
Green (0-2).

Monday’s contest at U-M 

Soccer 
Stadium 
showcased 

a number of trends — both 
positive and negative — that 
have followed Michigan, some of 
them dating back to last season.

For a third straight contest, 

the 
Wolverines 
were 
held 

scoreless in the first half, and 
were less aggressive in attack 
before 
intermission 
than 

after. In Michigan’s last three 
games, it has taken 17 first-half 
shots compared to 35 second-
half attempts, including five 
and 13, respectively, against 
Dartmouth.

The lack of first-half success 

included 
the 
Wolverines 

squandering a golden opportunity 
just after kickoff. In the eighth 
minute, freshman forward Umar 
Farouk Osman drew a penalty 
after a run into the box, but junior 
midfielder Ivo Cerda’s attempt 
was blocked by Big Green keeper 
Christopher Palacios.

Fortunately, 
Michigan’s 

defense, 
while 
not 
perfect, 

was effective in denying a 

Dartmouth 
squad 
replete 

with size, especially up front. 
Redshirt freshman goalkeeper 
Andrew Verdi made a number 
of 
acrobatic 
saves, 
junior 

centerback Daniel Mukuna was 
a physical presence in the air 
and junior left back Marcello 
Borges won several tackles at 
key moments.

Wolverines’ 
coach 
Chaka 

Daley attributed the slow start 
and 
subsequent 
near-misses 

in the second half to fatigue 

from 
Friday’s 

3-1 win against 
Cleveland 
State, 
injuries 

— Atuahene did 
not start because 
of 
an 
injury, 

and 
freshman 

forward 
Mohammed 
Zakyi sat out for 
a second straight 
game — and plain 

bad luck, of the same variety 
from last season.

“We just worry about the 

process, doing our job,” Daley 
said. “As we continue to get 
healthy that stat could turn on 
its head, but at the moment we 
are what we are and we just try 
to find a way.”

The Wolverines found a way 

just in time. Hallahan fired 

off five shots in a span of 10 
minutes midway through the 
second half, sparking a run of 
aggression 
that 
culminated 

when he assisted on Atuahene’s 
game-winner.

“The opposition is worn out,” 

Hallahan said. “They’re coming 
out with their game plan to slow 
us down in the first half and 
when that’s worn out we’re just 
picking them apart.”

Added 
Atuahene: 
“It’s 

soccer, 
sometimes 
you 
get 

lucky and score a lot of goals, 
and sometimes it’s the 90th 
minute. For us this year it’s more 
composure, keeping our shape. 
We keep doing the same thing 
over and over and eventually it 
breaks teams down.”

On Monday, Michigan did 

plenty of the same things it did 
last season. But it did one thing 
differently: It came out on top.

As the Wolverines prepare to 

take on Wisconsin in their Big 
Ten opener Friday, they have a 
chance to equal their win total 
from 2016, just two weeks into 
the season.

And for them, after last year, 

that’s all that matters.

“Everyone 
is 
just 
really 

excited to erase everything 
that happened last season,” 
Atuahene said. “Just start fresh 
and keep playing.”

‘M’ remains hungry during 
successful opening stretch

There 
were 
just 
eight 

minutes left on the game clock 
at U-M Soccer Stadium. The 
Wolverines and the Big Green 
were locked in a scoreless 
draw, and time was winding 
down for both teams.

Channeling 
his 
inner 

Johan 
Cruyff, 
Michigan 

men’s soccer junior Francis 
Atuahene slipped the ball 
behind his left leg to push 
past Dartmouth’s final line 
of defense. Exploiting the 
gap, Atuahene finished the 
ball with his right laces, low 
and hard to the bottom right 
corner of the net.

The Big Green (0-2) didn’t 

have much of a chance to 
respond, and the Wolverines 
(3-0-1) emerged with a 1-0 
victory.

Last 
season, 
it 
took 

Michigan 10 outings to earn 
its first win. Four games into 
this year, the Wolverines have 
already earned three.

Michigan 
coach 
Chaka 

Daley, though, doesn’t like to 
compare.

“We don’t talk about last 

season. That’s number one,” 
Daley said. “Two, we have a 
great character group. They’ve 

gone through some adversity, 
but the new guys only know 
what we’ve been building on 
since the spring. We take one 
game at a time and keep going 
from there.”

Daley specifies that he puts 

an emphasis on said character, 
and this team — more than 
most — has just that. The 
Wolverines 
appeared 
both 

prepared and composed on the 
pitch against Dartmouth.

“Everyone 

is trying to be 
responsible 
on 

the 
field 
and 

everyone 
is 

trying to look out 
for each other 
on 
the 
field,” 

Atuahene 
said. 

“It’s not about 
me, it’s not about 
any 
individual, 

it’s 
about 
the 

team.”

And 
though 

Atuahene 
and 
his 
fellow 

upperclassmen lead Michigan 
on and off the field, Daley 
doesn’t shy away from playing 
the younger players in the 
slightest. When he recruits, 
he looks for character, and 
expects them to be ready and 
eager from day one.

Six newcomers have seen 

significant playing time all 
over the field so far this season. 
Redshirt freshman goalkeeper 
Andrew Verdi has yet to miss 
a minute, conceding just two 
nearly unpreventable goals in 
his first four games. He tallied 
three impressive saves on the 
day.

Freshman 
Umar 
Farouk 

Osman comes to Ann Arbor 
as the 2017 Gatorade National 
Player of the Year and has 

already begun 
to stand out in 
the 
midfield. 

His 
nifty 

foot 
skills 

garnered 
the 

fans’ 
cheers 

throughout 
the 
entirety 

of the match 
as he weaved 
in and around 
the Big Green. 

Along 

with 
the 

fresh faces, opening up the 
season with five consecutive 
home games is new for the 
Wolverines. 
It 
has 
never 

occurred in Michigan men’s 
soccer 
history, 
and 
Daley 

thinks it may have played a 
role in the Wolverines’ early 
success.

“The second game of a 

double header on a weekend 
is very difficult for energy,” 
Daley said. “We were a little 
lackluster in the first half, but 
certainly the crowd and the 
Michigan Ultras pushed us 
through to the end there.”

And while the hype from the 

fans and the talent from the 
team’s new faces certainly add 
elements of both excitement 
and depth, Daley believes the 
core of the team’s success has 
come down to their attitude.

“In the end, it’s really comes 

down to character. (The team 
is) really grinding through and 
listening. They’re disciplined 
and they’re working hard at 
it. And they’re hungry,” Daley 
said with a smile. “I make sure 
they are.”

The battle they won

A

RLINGTON, Tex. — 
Special teams was the 
battle Michigan was 

supposed to lose.

Florida 

had kicker 
Eddy Pineiro 
and punter 
Johnny 
Townsend 
— both of 
whom were 
named to the 
preseason 
All-SEC 
second team. 
Pineiro made 
21 of 25 field-goal attempts last 
year — 11 of 13 from 40 yards 
or farther — while Townsend 
averaged 47.9 yards per punt with 
27 downed inside the 20-yard 
line.

The Wolverines, meanwhile, 

had lost Kenny Allen, who 
doubled as their kicker and 
punter. Before Saturday’s kickoff 
at AT&T Stadium, they weren’t 
sure who would replace him.

While that might not seem out 

of the ordinary for a Michigan 
team tasked with replacing all 
but five starters from last season, 
the backups-turned-starters 
on offense and defense had the 
benefit of playing important 
roles as rotational players. The 
potential options on the special 
teams unit, on the other hand, had 
never even seen the field.

It would have been 

understandable if redshirt 
freshman kicker Quinn Nordin 
and sophomore punter Will Hart 
couldn’t compete with the Gators 
in that phase of the game. The 
Wolverines would have banked on 
their offense and defense carrying 
the load. But Saturday, the special 
teams unit picked Michigan up 
when it faltered and defeated 
its Florida counterpart in the 
process, winning the battle and, 
ultimately, the game.

It all happened in the blink 

of an eye. Around the 12-minute 

mark of the second quarter, 
the Wolverines had a 10-3 lead 
and looked poised to add to it. 
Redshirt junior quarterback 
Wilton Speight 
had just thrown 
a 46-yard 
touchdown pass 
to freshman wide 
receiver Tarik 
Black, and was 
only building 
more momentum. 
But on the 
ensuing drive, one 
of Speight’spasses 
bounced off 
sophomore wide receiver Kekoa 
Crawford’s hands and into those 
of Gator defensive back Duke 
Dawson, who then took it 48 
yards to the end zone for a pick-
six to tie the game.

One and a half minutes passed 

on the game clock, and Speight 
had tossed another. Florida 
cornerback CJ Henderson 

corralled an 
errant throw and 
ran it back 41 
yards. Suddenly, 
the Gators had 
their first lead 
of the game and 
the momentum 
swinging 
dramatically in 
their favor.

Michigan 

coach Jim 

Harbaugh replaced Speight with 
fifth-year senior John O’Korn, but 
O’Korn couldn’t change the tide. 
On two consecutive drives, the 
Wolverines went three and out.

After the initial series, Hart 

lined up for his first career punt, 
but an energized Florida pulled 
off a block. The Gators gained 
possession at the Michigan 
37-yard line, and 
looked primed 
to add to their 
lead. But while 
the Wolverines’ 
defense managed 
to force a three 
and out, Pineiro 
was set up for 
a 47-yard field 
goal. Considering 
he had already 
nailed a 
46-yarder, it would have been 
expected for him to make it a 
10-point game.

It would have been Florida’s 

special teams unit that carried 
the plaudits, turning the game for 

the Gators. Instead, though it took 
them a little longer, that’s exactly 
what Michigan’s third phase did.

Pineiro missed the field goal, 

and on the 
Wolverines’ 
second three-
and-out 
possession, 
Nordin was set 
up for a 55-yard 
field goal. He had 
already converted 
from 25 yards 
out, but a 50-plus-
yard attempt is an 
entirely different 

monster that most kickers in the 
nation would miss.

But he didn’t. With all the poise 

of a kicker much older than he is, 
Nordin stared down his target 
and put the force of his body into 

the kick. Then he simply watched 
as it sailed 55 yards and dipped 
straight through the uprights.

“I was just doing whatever 

my team needed me to do, and 
if they needed me to put points 
on the board, then that’s what 
I was going to do for my team,” 
Nordin said. “That’s when they 
put me out there, and I just did 
my job.”

It may have just been three 

points, but it was worth much 
more to Michigan. In nailing 
a field goal from 55 yards out, 
Nordin did what no other college 
kicker had ever done at AT&T 
Stadium.

After that, Florida didn’t score 

another point. Nordin, on the 
other hand, scored six more, 
hitting a 30 and a 50-yard field 
goal on consecutive drives as part 
of the Wolverines’ 13-point third 
quarter outburst.

The former came after 

freshman defensive back Ambry 
Thomas forced and recovered 
a fumble at the Florida 16-yard 
line. The latter made him the 
first Wolverine ever to hit two 
field goals from 50-plus yards in a 
single game.

For a Michigan team whose 

ability has continually been called 
into question on the basis of their 
inexperience, maybe Nordin’s 
fellow young teammates just 
needed to see that their age and 
their ability are two completely 
different concepts.

“We’re a young team, 100 

percent, but youth isn’t always a 
bad thing,” Nordin said. “Youth 
brings energy, and I think moving 
on we’re going to continue to 
grow as a team.”

On Saturday, the Wolverines’ 

special teams unit took the first 
step in that growth. They weren’t 
supposed to win their phase of 
the game on paper. Then they did 
anyway.

The Marine whose inspiration Harbaugh found letter-perfect

On Monday, Anthony Riddle 

still couldn’t believe what Jim 
Harbaugh did with his letter.

After all, a 15-minute press 

conference 
after 
Michigan 

beat Florida — during which 
Harbaugh 
explained 
that 

Riddle’s 
letter 
became 
his 

pregame speech — turned him 
into a celebrity.

His Facebook blew up with 

requests from journalists and 
everyday 
individuals 
alike, 

all looking to talk to the man 
that 
inspired 
Harbaugh’s 

Wolverines. But before that, it 
started with his sister, Shelle.

“My sister ended up giving 

me a call,” Riddle said in a 
phone 
interview 
with 
the 

Daily. “And she’s like, ‘Hey, 
my boyfriend just got an ESPN 
alert that Jim Harbaugh just 
read some Marine’s letter. Was 
that you?’ ”

Yes, it was.

***

Before the letter, there was a 

speech.

Riddle 
was 
tasked 
with 

writing about his friend, who 
is set to receive an award in the 
coming month.

And for the entire offseason, 

Riddle had heard a collection 
of analysts say that Michigan 
was too inexperienced to have 
success in 2017. Finally, while 
writing the speech for his 
friend with ESPN and Big Ten 
Network on in the background, 
he decided he needed a break.

So nine days ago, on the 

Sunday 
before 
Michigan’s 

season 
opener, 
instead 
of 

finishing his speech, he started 
writing the letter.

He proofread it.
He Googled Jim Harbaugh’s 

email address, picking the only 
one he could find.

He clicked send.
Riddle 
never 
expected 

Harbaugh would read it, let 
alone reply. He sent the email 

thinking to himself, “What’s 
the worst that could happen?”

A half day later, a response 

from Michigan’s coach arrived 
in his inbox.

“I’m sitting at work, and it 

says Jim Harbaugh,” Riddle 
said. “My hands started shaking 
and I’m like, ‘No way.’ ”

Harbaugh told Riddle that 

he had put the irrelevance of 
youth in better perspective 
than he could have himself, and 
he admitted as much during 
his press conference Saturday 
night.

And he said that he would 

be sharing the letter with the 
team. But Riddle expected it 
to surface in practice and fade 
away quietly.

But now you know what 

really happened.

The thing is, it doesn’t stop 

there.

In 
his 
original 
reply, 

Harbaugh invited Riddle to 
Ann Arbor, asking to meet the 
Jackson, Mich. native and draw 
on his experiences. On Monday, 
Harbaugh took 
it a step further 
— 
telling 

Riddle that he 
is welcome to 
be on the field 
for a game of 
his choosing.

“It’s 
hard 

because 
I 

want to be as 
respectful 
to 

him 
and 
not 

take up any unneeded time,” 
Riddle said. “I think overall 
it just speaks volumes for 
what type of a person he is. 
He could’ve just looked at that 

letter and said, ‘Oh, I get 50,000 
of these a day.’”

***

Riddle’s path to the Marines 

began with a dream that would 
be familiar to most, but real 

to 
him 
— 
he 

wanted to be an 
astronaut.

In sixth grade, 

his 
father 
told 

him that if he 
worked hard, he 
would 
be 
able 

to get there, but 
added a word of 
caution: The men 
who go to space 
are some of the 

smartest people in the world.

Three years later, Riddle 

entered 
high 
school 
and 

realized 
his 
dream 
needed 

some tinkering.

“Going into high school, 

I didn’t have the greatest 
grades,” Riddle said. “I didn’t 
have the worst, I wasn’t dumb 
by any means. But I obviously 
didn’t have the grades to be 
like, ‘All right, I’m going to be 
an astronaut one day.’ ”

So he set out on a new path. 

He knew that most astronauts 
were former pilots and figured 
that, if he became a good 
enough pilot, his dream might 
be attainable after all.

But after evaluating his options 

for service school, he found 
himself visiting his brother’s best 
friend at boot camp in 1996. Then 
came the revelation.

“From that day on,” Riddle 

explained, “I said, ‘That’s what 
I’m doing.’ ”

Just after his high school 

graduation, 
he 
joined 
the 

Marines. 
But 
two 
weeks 

into boot camp, he broke his 
collarbone.

Riddle 
was 
forced 
into 

medical rehab, all the while 
watching everyone else around 
him move on and graduate. 
Eventually, he’d had enough.

“It (was) very depressing 

being in this medical rehab 
platoon,” Riddle said. “So I was 
there for about a week and I 
went back down to the doctor’s 
office and said, ‘Look, I’m 
not gonna sit here and watch 
everyone else move on and 
train, and I’m not gonna sit here 
for the next six weeks.’

“And she told me, ‘Well in 

order for you to get back into a 
platoon, you have to get down 
and do push-ups … and then 
you have to do a physical fitness 
test.’ ”

He did the push-ups. Then he 

beat everyone in the physical 
fitness test. He ran three miles 
in 17:10, and did 28 pull-ups and 
175 sit-ups in two minutes. He 
still had a broken collarbone.

He graduated boot camp in 

October of 2000, and became a 
platoon sergeant as a corporal 
— a position typically reserved 
for military members in their 
early 30s — roughly two years 
later.

He then led 52 Marines, all 

under the age of 20, into Iraq. 
The video of Sadam Hussein’s 
statue being torn down was 
filmed from his vehicle.

He did that all before his 

22nd birthday. And that’s what 
he told Jim Harbaugh in his 
letter.

Now he has a blank check to 

cash. And he’s spending it the 
way he wants to.

“(My sister) is a Spartans 

fan,” 
Riddle 
said. 
“She 

graduated 
from 
(Michigan 

State), so she’s like, ‘If he offers 
you to come to a game, that’s 
the one I want to go to.’

“I said, ‘No, if he offers me 

to come to a game it’s gonna be 
against Ohio.’ ”
