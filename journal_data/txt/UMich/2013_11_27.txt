Third and final
suspect yet to be
charged in murder
of Paul DeWolf
By SAM GRINGLAS
Daily StaffReporter
A second South Carolina resi-
dent has been charged in the
murder of Medical student Paul
DeWolf.
Joei Alexander Jordan, a 20
year-old man from Sumter, S.C.,
was arraigned Tuesday on one
count of homicide, two counts
of first degree homicide and one
count of conspiracy to commit
home invasion.
The home invasion charges
pertain to incidents at 210 North
Ingalls and 220 North Ingalls.
The latter is the address of the
Phi Rho Sigma fraternity, where
DeWolf was found dead in July.
Last week, 21 year-old Sha-
quille Alexander Keiley Jones
was arraigned on identical
charges.

According to Sumter County
court records, Jordan was in
traffic court in South Carolina
on March 19 for a speeding viola-
tion.
David Goldstein, an attorney
from Ann Arbor, will represent
the Jordan, who is currently
being held without bond. His
preliminary examination has
been set for Dec.12 at 8:30 a.m.
DeWolf, a second lieutenant in
the United States Air Force, was
found dead from a single gunshot
wound to the neck in his room at
the Phi Rho Sigma house on July
24. A coworker discovered his
body after he failed to show up
to work at the Ann Arbor Veteran
Affairs Healthcare System.
Earlier this month, police
reported that they had arrest-
ed three people in connection
with the murder. University
and Ann Arbor Police offered a
$10,000 reward for information
in the case, but officials said that
reward wasn't claimed asa result
of the arrests.
One of the three arrested sus-
pects still has not been charged
in the case.

Noreen Clark
remembered for her
relentless dedication
to public health
By SAM GRINGLAS
Daily StaffReporter
Noreen Clark, a former dean
of the School of Public Health,
died in New York City Saturday
after a brief illness.

Clark was the Myron E. Weg-
man Distinguished University
Professor of Public Health and
the director of the University
Center for Managing Chronic
Disease. She was also a pro-
fessor of health behavior and
health education at the School
of Public Health and a professor
of pediatrics at the University
Medical School.
By Tuesday night, almost 90
people had contributed to an
online guestbook commemorat-
ing Clark, posted on the School

of Public Health's website.
Dozens of University faculty
members, and former colleagues
from an array of institutions,
remembered Clark's infectious
smile, wit and can-do attitude.
"We are stunned and sad-
dened by Noreen's passing,"
University President Mary Sue
Coleman said in a statement.
"She was incredibly dedicated to
the health and well-being of oth-
ers, as evidenced by her teaching,
research and leadership as dean.
She was a friend and colleague,

and I will miss her enthusiasm."
During her tenure as dean,
Clark oversaw a multitude
of change within the School
of Public Health. She led the
reorganization of the school's
programs, which reduced the
number of individual depart-
ments, establishing new inter-
disciplinary programs. Clark
also championed the creation of
24 new academic centers.
By the end of her term as
dean, the school led the Uni-

STUDENT GOVERNMENT
CSG meetings
consumed by
election reform

Recent assembly
meetings have lacked
legislation that isn't
related to election
By AMRUTHA SIVAKUMAR
Daily StaffReporter
It has been four weeks since
the Central Student Govern-
ment Assembly last passed an
initiative not related to reform-
ing its election process. As the
current administration gears up
for the winter semester, elected
representatives may not accom-
plish as much as other assem-
blies have in the past, judging
by the volume of legislation
passed.
While Law student John Lin,
a CSG representative, acknowl-
edged that the majority of the
representatives' accomplish-
ments were made outside of
CSG, he said the lack of initia-
tives passed this semester is an
ongoing problem for the assem-
bly.
Lin, who is chair of the Reso-

lutions Committee, said only
one piece of legislation that
dealt with "grassroots initia-
tives" was passed this year. All
other work approved by CSG
either amended the governing
rules of student government or
funded and sponsored campus
organizations.
"That's shocking," Lin said.
"The problem lies in what hap-
pens in a Tuesday night where
it's been overwhelmed by the
rule changes - it hasn't become
that forum for ideas."
In 2010, CSG advocated
student veteran benefits and
convinced University admin-
istrators to provide former
service members with waived
application fees and in-state
tuition. The annual four-day
Fall Study Break in mid-Octo-
ber and more Saturday night
University dining options are
also accomplishments of previ-
ous CSG administrations.

of student government contin-
ued to work on its own initia-
tives - such as the off-campus

By KATIE BURKE
Daily News Editor
The matchup ESPN has dubbed
"the greatest North American sports
rivalry of the twentieth century" has
infiltrated an already divided envi-
ronment - the U.S. Congress.
U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown (D-
Ohio) and U.S. Representative Gary
Peters (D-Bloomfield Hills) placed
a "friendly wager" Tuesday on the
outcome of Saturday's football game
between Ohio State University and
Michigan football.
On the line is a six-pack of craft
beer - the loser must give the win-
ner beer from his home state. The
beers of choice are Great Lakes
Christmas Ale, brewed in Ohio, or
a brew from the Detroit Beer Com-
pany, based in downtown Detroit.
Brown initially approached Peters
with the idea of such a wager, which
Peters enthusiastically accepted.

Project connects
violence to potrayal
of women in media
By JACK TURMAN
For The Daily
Many television and Internet
marketers aim to produce the
most eye-catching advertise-
ments hoping that consumers

will remember their product.
But, are they reinforcing negative
gender roles in the process?
The Stop Violence Against
Women event Tuesday night
on the corner of South Univer-
sity and East University Avenues
stemmed from this topic in a
Women's Studies class. Art &
Design juniors Madelyn Etzcorn
and Elizabeth McCubbrey, and
LSA junior Zachary Howard
organized the project to raise

awareness abouthowwomenare
portrayed in the media.
The trio chose to focus on
advertisements because they
believe some can promote rape
culture or the idea that women
can be bought for sex. Their hope
is that the project will create a
safe environment where people
can freely discuss rape culture.
The event included two pro-

U.S. spewing 50% more
methane than EPA says

French prostitution bill
aimed at fining clients

Livestock, oil
drilling are sources
of extra emissions
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
United States is spewing 50 per-
cent more methane - a potent
heat-trapping gas - than the fed-
eral government estimates, a new
comprehensive scientific study
says. Much of it is coning from
just three states: Texas, Oklaho-

ma and Kansas.
That'means methane may be a
bigger global warming issue than
thought, scientists say. Methane
is 21 times more potent at trap-
ping heat than carbon dioxide,
the most abundant global warm-
inggas, although it doesn't stay in
the air as long.
Much of that extra methane,
also called natural gas, seems
to be coming from livestock,
including manure, belches, and
flatulence, as well as leaks from

H-,

refining and drilling for oil and
gas, the study says. It was pub-
lished Monday in the Proceed-
ings of the National Academy of
Science.
The study estimates that in
2008, the U.S. poured 49 mil-
lion tons of methane into the air.
That means U.S. methane emis-
sions trapped about as much heat
as all the carbon dioxide pollu-
tion coming from cars, trucks,
and planes in the country in six
months.
That's more than the 32 mil-
lion tons estimated by the U.S.
Environmental Protection
Administration or the nearly
29 million tons reckoned by the
European Commission.
"Something is very much off
in the inventories," said study co-
author Anna Michalak, an Earth
scientist at the Carnegie Insti-
tution for Science in Stanford,
Calif. "The total U.S. impact on
the world's energy budget is dif-
ferent than we thought, and it's
worse."
EPA spokeswoman Alisha
Johnson said her agency hasn't
had time to go through the study
yet, but hopes it will help "refine
our estimates going forward."
While the world has a good
handle on how much carbon
dioxide is pumped into the air,
scientists have been more baffled
by methane emissions. They have
had to use computer models to
estimate how much methane is
going into that air.
This study, however, was
based on nearly 13,000 measure-
ments from airplane flights and
tall towers, the most used in any
such research.
The information was collect-
ed in 2008. Scientists have yet
to analyze their data from 2012,
and that will capture more of
any impact of the natural gas
boom from hydraulic fractur-
ing, Michalik said. Studies
recently have shown conflict-
ing results about how much
methane escapes during frack-
ing and other forms of fossil
fuel drilling.

Proposed law will
decriminalize
soliciting on
the street
PARIS (AP) - France's gov-
ernment is pushing one of
Europe's toughest laws against
prostitution and sex trafficking,
and other countries are watch-
ing closely. Advocates hope
that a draft French law going
to parliament Wednesday will
help change long-held attitudes
toward the world's oldest profes-
sion - by punishing the custom-
er and protecting the prostitute.
The bill, however, is facing
resistance in a country with a
libertine reputation and a Medi-
terranean macho streak, and has
prompted petitions defending
those who buy sex. Signatories
include screen icon Catherine
Deneuve -who played a pros-
titute in the cult film "Belle de
Jour" - and crooner Charles
Aznavour.
Prostitution is currently legal
in France, but brothels, pimping
and soliciting in public are ille-
gal.
The bill has prompted debate
about sex and sexism in France,
where former International
Monetary Fund chief Domi-
nique Strauss-Kahn is facing
charges of aggravated pimping.
He denies wrongdoing, though
his lawyer has defended Strauss-
Kahn's free-wheeling sex life.
It has also called attention to
the evolution of the sex business,
as the number of foreign prosti-
tutes, especially from Asia and
eastern Europe, has soared in
recent years.
The proposed law would
introduce a 1,500-euro ($2,000)
fine -rising to 3,000-euro at the
second offense- for the clients
of prostitutes. They could also be
forced to attend classes aimed at
highlightingthe harms of prosti-
tution.
The bill aims to decriminal-

ize the estimated 40,000 pros-
titutes in France, by scrapping a
2003 law that bans soliciting on
the streets, and making it easier
for foreign prostitutes to remain
legally in France if they enter a
process to get out of prostitu-
tion. One of the bill's authors,
Maud Olivier, says it's about
"getting rid the consequence of
unequal and archaic relation-
ships between men and women."
Other countries such as Ger-
many, Switzerland and the Neth-
erlands, where brothels are legal,
are especially interested in the
French experience.
"If France moves, that could
be the turning point for other
European countries," said Gre-
goire Thery, secretary-general
of the Mouvement du Nid, an
organization which says it helps
5,000 prostitutes in France each
year.
The proposed law-writtenby
a group of lawmakers from both
right and left and backed by the
Socialist government- follows
the example of Sweden, which
passedsimilarlegislationin1999.
A report commissioned by the
Swedish government showed
that the number of people
involved in street prostitution
in Sweden's three largest cities
dropped from around730 in 1999
to 300-430 a year in the 10 years
after that. At the same time,
street prostitution in neigh-
boring Norway and Denmark
increased.
The Netherlands went the
other way, legalizing prostitu-
tion in 2000. But the policy has
come in for criticism for playing
into the hands of criminals and
human traffickers who exploit
women. The government is now
aiming to crack down on human
traffickingbytighteninglaws.
Supporters of the French draft
law argue that it could reduce
sex trafficking and empower
prostitutes.
"The current law is not on our
side so we keep being trapped in
that system, and the client knows
that, he plays with that. When

we hear about 'prostitution by
choice,' I think that it is still
prostitution as violence toward
women, and we cannot keep tol-
erating that violence anymore,"
said Rosen Hicher, 57, who was a
prostitute from 1988 to 2009.
"One day, a client told me: 'If
you don't accept to do it without
condom, I will call the police,"'
she told a news conference. "I
was able to say to him: 'clear
off'. But another one wouldn't
because she would be under con-
trol of a pimp or would be sold by
her husband, her father or her
brother."
Opponents of the French bill
argue the opposite, and fear that
cracking down will push prosti-
tutes into a dangerous position:
Being forced to hide, they would
be even more at the mercy of
pimps and violent clients, and cut
offfromthe organizations ableto
help them.
"More clandestine practices
means we would find ourselves in 'ei
more secluded places, and there-
fore subject to possible violence,"
Thierry Schaffauser, a 31-year
old escort and spokesman for sex
workers' group Strass, told The
Associated Press.
And in dealings with the cli-
ent, he said, prostitutes would
"have less power because when
you make less profit, you might
have to accept clients that you
wouldn't normally accept, accept
doing something you might not
have accepted before."
A contentious open letter
titled "Hands off my whore" was
released last month by a group
of men, including a lawyer for
Strauss-Kahn, in favor of a man's
right to buy physical pleasure.
And earlier this month, a
petition emerged, signed by 60
celebrities, including Deneuve
and Aznavour, saying: "With-
out supporting or promot-
ing prostitution, we reject the
penalization of those who pros-
titute themselves and those
who buy their services, and we
ask for a real debate without
ideological prejudice."

NEWS BRIEFS
DETROIT
Motor city sees
41 hours without
violence
Detroit has a day-and-a-half
streak of no reported homicides
or non-fatal shootings, police said
Tuesday.
The streak started at midnight
Monday morning and as of 5:15
p.m. Tuesday was intact.
"For the first time in months
the city of Detroit has seen its lon-
gest period of non-violence," the
department said in a release.
Just weeks ago, three men
were shot and killed and six oth-
ers wounded in a rear gambling
room of an east side Detroit bar-
bershop. A witness told police that
the shooter pulled into a rear alley
and fired shots into an open rear
door of the barbershop on Nov. 6.

Ford recalls Escape
for seventh time
The hot-selling SUV has been
recalled seven times since it was
redesigned and went on sale in the
spring of 2012.
The first of two recalls
announced Tuesday affects more
. than 161,000 Escapes worldwide
fromthe2013 modelyear with 1.6-
liter four-cylinder engines.
Ford says the cylinder heads
can overheat and crack, causing
oil leaks.
Of those SUVs, fuel lines on
about 12,000 may have been
installed incorrectly. They could
become chafed and leak gas. Many
were repaired under a previous
recall.
Ford says the oil leaks caused 13
fires but no injuries. There haven't
been any fires from the fuel line
problems.
WASHINGTON
White House
appeals for return
ofretired FBI agent
The White House on Tuesday
made a holiday appeal to Iran to
return a retired FBI agent and two
other Americans being held in the
country.
Robert Levinson, the former
FBI agent, disappeared during a
business trip to Iran's Kish Island
in March 2007. The United States
believes the private investigator
and father of seven was abducted
and is being held in Iran. Levin-
son's case was a topic in recent
negotiations between U.S. and
Iran aimed at addressing Iran's
nuclear program and improving
diplomatic ties.
White House spokesman Josh
Earnest said Tuesday that Obama
specifically raised Levinson's case
as well as those of U.S. citizens
Saeed Abedini and Amir Hekmati,
who have been detained in Iran,
during a telephone conversation

earlier in the fall with Iranian
President Hassan Rouhani.
GENEVA
Global free-trade
deal colapses
Negotiators came close but
failed Tuesday to clinch a free-
trade deal that could have helped
boost the world economy by $1
trillion a year and cleared the way
for a broader global agreement.
Diplomats from the World
Trade Organization's 159 mem-
bers had been trying to forge an
agreement before a trade minis-
ters' meeting next week in Bali,
Indonesia. Achieving a deal in Bali
is seen as a final effort to revive
a broader 12-year effort to ease
global trade rules.
The mini-deal discussed in
Geneva had been intended, in part,
to reduce delays and inefficiencies
at national borders. Making it eas-
ier to move goods across borders
could boost the global economy
by nearly $1 trillion a year and
support 21 million jobs, according
to a report co-written by Jeffrey
Schott, a senior fellow in interna-
tional trade at the Peterson Insti-
tute for International Economics.

ning aground, killing up to 30
people and leaving the rest
clingingto the vessel for hours,
authorities said Tuesday.
The exact death toll
remained uncertain. Authori-
ties on the scene confirmed at
least 20 dead and determined
the number could reach 30
based on accounts from survi-
vors, said Lt. Origin Deleveaux,
a Royal Bahamas Defense
Force spokesman.
The remains of five victims
had been recovered and the
Bahamas military and police
were working with the U.S.
Coast Guard to recover addi-
tional bodies as they pulled
survivors from the stranded
sailboat.
"Right now, we are just try-
ing to recover as many bodies
as we possibly can," Deleveaux
said.
Authorities believe the
migrants had been at sea for
eight to nine days with lim-
ited food and water and no life
jackets, Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr.
Gabe Somma said. Many were
severely dehydrated when
the first rescue crews reached
them. The boat, in addition
to being overloaded, likely
encountered rough weather,
Deleveaux said.
"It was obviously justgrossly
overloaded, unbalanced,unsea-
worthy," Somma said. "An
incredibly dangerous voyage."
The capsizing of overloaded
vessels occurs with disturb-
ing frequency in the area, most
recently in mid-October when
four Haitian women died off
Miami. There have also been
fatal incidents near the Turks

and Caicos Islands, between
Haiti and the Bahamas, and in
the rough Mona Passage that
divides the Dominican Repub-
lic and Puerto Rico.
"Unfortunately we see these
types of tragedies occur on a
monthly basis," Coast Guard
Chief Petty Officer Ryan Doss
said. "Every year we see hun-
dreds of migrants needlessly
lose their lives at sea taking
part in these dangerous and
illegal voyages."
It's common enough that the
CoastGuardrecentlydeveloped
a public service announcement
that will run on TV and radio
in Florida, Haiti, the Bahamas
and the Dominican Republic
urging people not to risk the
deadly ocean voyages.
This latest incident occurred
late Monday near Harvey Cays,
about 80 miles (125 kilome-
ters) southeast of New Provi-
dence, the island that includes
the capital of Nassau, and 260
miles (417 kilometers) south-
east of Miami.
Fishermen spotted the dan-
gerously overloaded sailboat
and alerted the Bahamas mili-
tary, which asked the Coast
Guard for assistance in locat-
ing the vessel, Somma said. By
the time it was spotted, the
40-foot boat had run aground
in an area dotted with tiny out-
croppings and reefs and then
capsized.
Photos taken by the Coast
Guard showed people clinging
to every available space on the
overturned vessel. Some were
taken to a clinic on nearby Sta-
niel Cay fortreatment for dehy-
dration.
By late Tuesday afternoon,
the Coast Guard and Baha-
mian authorities had rescued
about 110 people, including 19
women. Deleveaux said there
were no children on board.
Smugglers will often seek to
blend in with the migrants
when they are captured and
authorities did not announce
any arrests.

France to send 1 btroops
to Central African Republic 

Forces will attempt
to stop potential
genocide in former
French colony
DAKAR, Senegal (AP) -
France promised Tuesday to
send 1,000 troops to Central
African Republic amid warnings
about the potential for geno-
cide in the near-anarchic former
French colony.
Whether the French forces
will save lives largely depends on
how far the foreign soldiers ven-
ture outside the capital, Bangui,
to the lawless provinces where
mostly Muslim rebels have been
attacking Christian villages, and
Christian militias have recently
launched retaliatory attacks.
The French move comes less
than a week after French Foreign
Minister Laurent Fabius warned
"the country is on the verge of
genocide" and marks the second
time this year that France has
sent troops to a former colony in
Africa.
In January, thousands of
French soldiers launched an
offensive to free northern Mali's
major towns from the control of
al-Qaida-linked militants. After
that success, the French military
is stepping up its efforts in Cen-
tral African Republic, a lawless
country in the heart of the con-
tinent.
No other country is expect-
ed to take action if France, the
former colonial power, doesn't
get involved, said Francois
Heisbourg, a French analyst at
the Foundation for Strategic
Research think tank in Paris.
"We are a prisoner of history
and geography: This is our neigh-
borhood, and yes, we have troops
in the area for historical reasons,"
Heisbourg said. "And given the

humanitarian situation and the
political pressure, there is no way
we can avoid doingthis."
However, it is not clear how
much can be accomplished by
1,000 French troops in a country
of 4.6 million people where many
roads have not been repaved
since independence in1960.
An international presence is
needed given the limited capac-
ity of Central African Republic's
own security forces, said Chris-
tian Mukosa, a researcher with
the Africa division of Amnesty
International.
"It's really very important that
the French don't stay only in Ban-
gui, but go to Bouca and other hot
spots where currently there are
serious human rights abuses and
where populations are at risk," he
said.
In the northwest town of
Bouca, nun Angelina Santaguili-
ana said she lives in fear of a rebel
attack on her Catholic mission.
Already some 2,400 people have
sought refuge there in the past
week, crowding the floors of the
church at night and taking shel-
ter under trees on the mission's
yard.
"If the French come to help
with disarmament in our region,
it will be a good thing, but if there
is fighting it would make things
worse," she said by telephone
Tuesday, with the sounds of chil-
dren wailingin the background.
More than 35,000 other peo-
ple have sought refuge at another
Catholic mission in Bossangoa,
according to church officials
there.
Central African Republic's
current chaos started late last
year when a number of rebel
groups joined forces to form
the coalition known as Seleka.
In March the rebels overthrew
the president of a decade and
installed their leader in power.
But rebel leader-turned-presi-

dent Michel Djotodia now exerts
little control over the renegade
fighters in the provinces, most of
whom are Muslim and who are
accused of committing killings,
torture and rape, and forcibly
recruiting child soldiers.
France has warned for months
about the deteriorating secu-
rity in Central African Republic,
and its pledge follows warnings
from the U.N. special adviser on
the prevention of genocide who
called the crisis in the country,
"one of the worst human rights
and humanitarian crises of our
time."
The conflict's toll is difficult
to determine as the most vicious
attacks have taken place in
remote villages.
About 1 in 10 people have been
displaced from their homes,
according to international aid
group Medecins Sans Frontieres,
or Doctors Without Borders.
Details only trickle in when
survivors make their way to
safety and the insecurity in the
region makes it impossible for aid
groups to determine how many
have died. And many of the reb-
els accused of committing atroci-
ties have been integrated into
the national army, rendering the
country's security forces unable
to combat the cycle of violence.
Reports of killings of civilians
and looting emerged in Bangui
soon after the rebel invasion
in March. The crisis deepened
several months later when the
rebels began targeting the area
of Bossangoa, the home region
of ousted President Francois
Bozize and many of his perceived
supporters. Some villages have
been completely decimated with
homes burned to the ground. The
Christian self-defense militias
that emerged are also accused of
attacking Muslim civilians, many
of whom have suffered under the
Seleka rebellion already.

More meals, less flexibility
The University should offer more options for student dining plans
Beginning in the 2014 to 2015 academic year, student dining will
be shaken up. Currently, students living in the residence halls
can choose between two meal plans: 150 meals and 100 Dining
Dollars or 125 meals and 300 Dining Dollars. Next fall, students living in
residence halls will receive a dining plan with unlimited meals, a Univer-
sity Housing decision that will benefit many students. However, Housing
should think about also including a plan that offers more flexibility for
those students who don't plan on eating exclusively in dining halls.

t all started when I was a soph-
omore in high school and my
dermatologist gave me a pro-
scription for Yaz,
a high-estrogen
birth control
pill that was
rumored to cure
acne. Unfortu-
nately, like many
women who '
begin birth con- EMILY
trol, that initial PITTINOS
visit with my
doctor was short.
Too short. I don't remember being
told many of the side effects and
none of the science was explained
to me. But at the time, I hardly
blinked - I was a painfully zit-faced
teen and was completely convinced
that smoothing out my skin would
change my quality of life. Plus, I
had a horny, hormonal boyfriend
who was bugging me for sex, and
protecting my eggs from his sperm
seemed like a wise decision. So I
did what a lot of people do: I blindly
trusted my doctor.
Looking back on the whole event,
there must have been some sort of
race to prove that Yaz worked as
zit-repellant because my doctor
didn't just write me a prescription.
She practically pushed the pills on
me. It was before the Affordable
Care Act, so my private insurance
didn't cover birth control, and each
pack of Yaz was $75. Instead of pre-
scribing a generic brand, she gave
me 12 free samples and told me to
come back in a year. The next year
she did the same thing.
A few months later, I was home
over Christmas break watching
"Iron Chef" on my parents' futon and
texting my boyfriend like it was my
job. I held my flip phone in one hand
and ate sugar cookies with my other
as a tingling sensation entered my
fingertips. I shook my hand, thinking
it had fallen asleep, but the tingling
only travelled up my arm, my neck
and into the left side of my lips. It was
like I could feel my molecules danc-
ing, or a swarm of microscopic bees
were swimming through my blood-
stream. And then I felt nothing.
Holy shit, I thought. I'm having a
fuckingstroke.

As opposed to current plans that limit
swipes, the new offerings allow students to
eat unlimited meals. Under the standard cur-
rent plan, a student averages between eight and
nine meal swipes per week, meaning students
could not eat even two meals a day. With the
unlimited plan, students have the option of eat-
ing three or more meals a day without the fear
of running out. Furthermore, since this change
will not increase the price of housing, students
have this opportunity without paying more.
The redesigned meal structure will also
positively impact off-campus students.
Although the details have not been finalized,
new off-campus meal plans with fewer meals
should be more affordable.
Although the new plan could allow stu-
dents to be more flexible, the limited hours
that dining halls are open might prove
restrictive. Dining Dollars and Blue Bucks
provide students the option of eating at loca-
tions open earlier in the morning and later at
night. Thus, University Housing should con-
sider extending dining hall operation hours

to accommodate students' busy schedules.
Although unlimited meals are beneficial to
many, the plan could be more flexible by pro-
viding other options for students. With current
meal plans, students can choose fewer meals in
exchange for more Dining Dollars. Under the
new plan, however, students can only obtain
more Dining Dollars by purchasing a more
expensive meal plan. With making the unlim-
ited plan standard, Housing should provide stu-
dents an option with alimited amountof swipes
and more Dining Dollars to accommodate dif-
ferent preferences.
Besides providing options within the meal
plans, the University needs to consider finan-
cially limited students who would benefit from
opting out of a meal plan altogether. Forcing
students to purchase a plan when other options
may be less expensive is unfair.
The new meal plan structure has room to
improve if more options are made available.
However, unlimited meals and more afford-
able off-campus dining is a large step in the
right direction.

Equity over equality
E ,y

Is the University a luxury product?

At this very moment, there exists a silver
spray-painted swastika on the sidewalk of
North University Avenue. Directly across the
street from some of our academic buildings,
a symbol of hatred is lurking, incognito. As a
Jewish woman fighting to navigate my identity
in this Christian-dominated society, stumbling
across this image between classes made me feel
scared, isolated and despondent.
On a campus where roughly 20 percent of
students are Jewish, many of my peers are
quick to dismiss issues of anti-Semitism. To
many, my life, and the lives of my Jewish peers,
seems quite privileged. There are many of us
here walking the same halls, taking the same
classes and living all-around similar lives to
our Christian counterparts. We are a minority
population, yes, but we have large representa-
tion and equal opportunity here, and therefore
our identity struggles are treated relatively dis-
missively the moment we step foot on campus.
I'll be the first to admit that Judaism has
served me relatively well in my ability to main-
tain privilege in society. Fortunately for us,
many Jews are now considered white in a way
that our religious minority peers often are not.
However, our ability to "pass" only gets us so
far. I am often frustrated by the need to educate
my Christian peers on my belief system, or to
speak on behalf of the entire Jewish population.
There are several spaces on campus in which I
might be unwelcome as a Jewish woman, and
I feel uncomfortable throughout December
as Christmas music suddenly surrounds me
everywhere I go. And then there's the swastika

on the sidewalk outside Panera.
Contrary to popular belief, the life of a
Jewish student at the University of Michigan
is far from privileged. Real privilege is when
there isn't a symbol for wanting you dead.
As we continue in our fight for radical
change in our campus's demographic make-
up, I hope that the University is able to see
beyond numbers. The problems on campus do
not go away with higher representation, but
rather a complete reformation of campus atti-
tudes, power dynamics and educational tac-
tics. Last week a professor of mine explained
to me the true difference between equity
and equality. Equality, she said, is a world
in which everyone is given the same pair of
shoes. Equity is a world in which everyone
is given a pair of shoes that fits them per-
sonally. It's not enough for the University to
enroll more "diverse" students, to give them
each a pair of shoes. Racism, classism and
many other "isms" are alive and rampant on
our campus today. Their existence inherently
prohibits minority students from feeling that
our shoes truly fit, no matter how many of us
are walking around in them.
As the University goes forward in its efforts
to diversify, I hope that it's remembered that
the world is much more complex, subjective
and personal than statistics in a handbook.
Numerical representation does not eliminate
oppression, and handing us all shoes does not
make them fit.

Ann Arbor is the new Brook-
lyn. Bold claim, you say, to
compare Ann Arbor to the
borough once
considered Man-
hattan's infe-
rior little sister
and now hailed
as the land of
artisan pickles,
handmade felt
hats and Etsy ZOE
shop-owners. If
you think about STAHL
it though, it
makes sense. Last
spring, the independent bookstore
Literati opened, bringing Ann Arbor
almost nightly readings and more
"n+1" magazines than we know what
to do with. The food scene - that has
come to both represent and measure
just how (insufferably) trendy a city
is - seems tres Brooklyn,too. There's
Babo, the Sava-owned boutique pro-
duce market, and then the Wafel
Shop, a restaurant solely devoted to
specialty waffles, indicating Ann
Arbor ranks pretty high on the bou-
gie matrix.
Retail aside, Ann Arbor's built
environment is becoming fright-
eningly similar to Brooklyn's.
Under New York City Mayor
Michael Bloomberg, Brooklyn's
waterfront on the East River dra-
matically changed: sleek glass high-
rises for the 20-to-30-something set
replaced the abandoned factories.
And with the recently constructed
Landmark, Varsity and Zaragon
West, Ann Arbor seems to be head-
ing in the same direction. It doesn't
look as if this trend is going to stop
anytime soon, either. On the corner
of South Division and Huron streets,
another high-rise building is going
up. The local hotelier and property
developer Dennis Dahlmann plans
to build an apartment building com-
plete with ground-level retail and
restaurant complex over the former
YMCA lot, too.
Ann Arbor's local government has
been working hard to revitalize the
city's downtown, and, at first, I was
all for this high-density urban devel-
opment. As a New Yorker, I would
proudly argue the fact that apart-
ment living is better for the environ-
ment. Less square footage means
significantly reduced carbon foot-
prints. Apartment units, arranged in

closer proximity than houses, allow
far less heat to escape. Even more,
denser development in Ann Arbor's
downtown encourages more walk-
ing. Studies confirm what common
sense tells us: residents in city cen-
ters produce significantly less car-
bon emissions than those living in
the suburbs.
And better yet, this downtown
development has helped stimulate
Ann Arbor's economy, challenging
the widely held belief that what's
good for the environment is nec-
essarily bad for the economy. Phil
D'Anieri, University lecturer in urban
and regional planning, wrote in an
e-mail interview, "the density repre-
sented by these high rises is good for
downtown vitality." These high-rises
create demand for new shops - gro-
cery stores, clothing shops and vari-
ous other retail stores - and a more
vibrant economic center.
But that's where the upside of this
type of urban development seems
to end. With

thinking and behavior. As D'Anieri
accurately observed, "the underly-
ing trend these luxury buildings
represent (is) a university environ-
ment skewing steadily away from a
publicly-minded sense of itself and
toward an identity as high-end life-
style product." It seems then that
the University has become just as
much an exclusive, luxury product
as an institute of higher learning.
And it's not all together the Univer-
sity's fault, either. With funds from
the state dwindling, the University
increasingly relies on the tuition of
wealthier and often out-of-state stu-
dents to make ends meet.
To what degree is the Univer-
sity responsible then? They have
worked to create more attractive
housing options with the recent
and expensive renovations of Alice
Lloyd Residence Hall, East Quad
Residence Hall and Northwood
Apartments. However, while it may
be true that these dorms offer alter-

- wrote that the School of Public

ing this weekend," Peters said in a
statement.
Peters, who holds degrees
from Alma College, University
of Detroit Mercy, Wayne State
University Law School and
Michigan State University, will
have to put aside his MSU loy-
alties and cheer on the Wolver-
ines. His daughter is currently
in her freshman year at the Uni-

as dean, Philbert wrote that she
also expanded the number of fac-
ulty and pioneered research in an
array of disciplines.
"The loss of our colleague,
friend and mentor has redoubled
our commitment to improved
health for all," Philbert said.
Clark frequently put her
research into practice, using her
expertise to work toward improv-
ing health and quality of life in
Kenya, the Philippines and China.
As a leader in public health with
significant experience abroad,
Clark was a member of the Council
on Foreign Relations - an influen-
tial group of leaders from a variety
of backgrounds that weigh in on
international relations issues.
Clark was often tapped for
membership or leadership in a
multitude of public health insti-
tutions. She was a former mem-
ber of the Advisory Council of
the National Institute of Envi-
ronmental Health Sciences and
president of the Society for Public
Health Education.
When her deanship ended in
2005, Clark led the new Univer-
sity Center for Managing Chronic
Disease as director, a position
in which allowed her to utilize
her decades of experience study-
ing asthma, heart conditions and
other chronic diseases.

Clark was recently researching
childhood asthma for her final pub-
lished article "Declines with Age in
Childhood Asthma Symptoms."
Her propensity for hands-on
engagement appeared early in
Clark's career. After graduating
from the University of Utah with
a degree in political science, she
worked as a community organiz-
er, according to the 2004 article.
Clark also received two master's
degrees and a doctorate from
Columbia University, all related
to adult education.
Between 1974 and 1981, she
served on the faculty of the
Columbia University School of
Public Health before joining the
University's School of Public
Health in 1981.
Clark, who was born in Scot-
land in 1943 and moved to the
United States at age eight, par-
tially credited her trans-Atlantic
emigration as her impetus to try
new things, whether a depart-
mental reorganization, a com-
plex research challenge or a new
hobby like fly-fishing.
Clark is survived by her hus-
band of 30 years, documentary
filmmaker George Pitt, her son
Alex and her grandson Max. The
School of Public Health will host
a public celebration of Clark's life
in the spring.

National Party presidential candidate Juan Orlando Hernandez arrives to give a press conference in Tegucigalpa, Hon-
duras, Monday. Hernandez, the ruling party candidate, held a comfortable lead in early vote counting to become Hondu-
ras' next president, while two of his four main opponents began crying foul early Monday.
Honduras' recently elected
leader names new team


said. "There's no space for that
kind of creativity and collabora-
tion during assembly meetings."
Manes said it's a misconcep-
tion that CSG's'productivitycan be
gauged by the volume of resolutions
it has passed. She believes that reso-
lutions are "more of a formality"
and do not reflect the comprehen-
sive, substantive work ofthe body.
Manes currently is working
with the dean of the College of
Engineering to make Race and
Ethnicity classes a requirement
for Engineering students, similar
to the curriculum in LSA. Other
ongoing projects spearheaded
by representatives include insti-
tutionalizing voter registration
at the University and increasing
the availability and usefulness of
Intergroup Relations classes.
However, these initiatives have
yet to be brought through the
legislative process and have not
received the formal support of
CSG.

Business senior Scott Christo-
pher, former chair of CSG's Entre-
preneurship Commission, said he
believes that the greatest strength
of CSG leaders lies in the mentor-
ship they can provide to the cam-
pus community.
"In my opinion, the most
important role of the representa-
tive is to be the voice of the stu-
dents outside of the meeting,"
Christopher said. "CSG is a lot of
bureaucracy, so if you want to get
anything accomplished you have
to be strategic."
Christopher - who also served
as the president of MPowered
last year - said he believed that
while formality was important to
the institution, it often "bogged
down" its productivity.
"It legitimizes in a lot of ways
because I imagine if you were a
representative, it makes you feel
important and adds a sense of
duty to it," Christopher said. "But
also, it makes you complacent."

Votes took longer
than expected
to count in the
contested election
TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras
(AP) - Honduras' newly elected
president named his transition
team Tuesday, while about 200
students protested to demand a
recount of the vote in the poor
Central American nation.
Juan Orlando Hernandez, the
ruling National Party's candidate
who campaigned on a law-and-
order platform, hadn't spoken
publicly since just after the elec-
tion Sunday, but he released
a statement that included the
names of those who will help him
take over the government from
President Porfirio Lobo.
Hernandez, 45, has all but
won the hotly contested presi-
dential race, electoral authorities
said late Monday in describing
his lead as "irreversible."
Even before the announce-
ment, his main competitor, Xio-
mara Castro, had challenged the

official returns and claimed vic-
tory. Her husband, former Presi-
dent Manuel Zelaya, who was
ousted in a 2009 coup, said they
wouldn't accept the results, but
the campaign did not comment
on the elections tribunal all but
declaring Hernandez the winner.
Castro had led in opinion
polls early in the campaign, but
Hernandez closed the gap in the
closing weeks as he promised to
do "whatever I have to" in fight-
ing crime in a country where
much of the cities are controlled
by gangs and outlying remote
areas are held by drug runners.
Hernandez had 34 percent of
the votes to 29 percent for Cas-
tro in an eight-candidate field,
according to the most recent
returns, with about a third of the
votes still uncounted.
"It's not the final result, but it's an
irreversibletrend,"tribunal spokes-
woman Lourdes Rosales said.
Electoral officials said they
hoped to have final results by
Thursday, but they didn't explain
why it was taking so long to fin-
ish the vote count. The tribunal
reported results from 54 percent
of the votes by late Sunday, but

barely advanced the count over
the next two days.
About 200 university students
blocked a major thoroughfare in
the capital Tuesday to protest
what they said were fraudulent
election results and demand a
recount. The students clashed
with police officers who threw
tear gas at the crowd.
Election observers for both
the European Union and Organi-
zation of American States issued
statements Tuesday describing
the election and vote count as
transparent.
Dario Euraque, a professor of
history and international studies
at Trinity College in Hartford,
Connecticut, said Hernandez's
candidacy resonated with Hon-
durans because he pushed
through legislation giving the
military a role in patrolling
crime-beset cities.
"Military presence is key
when you practically have a
failed state," Euraque said. "It's
a mistake to ask they retire (to
their barracks). People don't
understand it. They want secu-
rity and will accept that dis-
course."

"It's so pervasive," Etzcorn said.
"Everyone sees it everyday, but I
don't think people take the time and
stop to really think about it or have
been exposed to the violence that is
put towards women."
Though there's much progress to
bemadeasanation, Etzcornsaidshe
believes that the Ann Arbor commu-
nity already has a basic knowledge
about rape culture and the media.
"Ann Arbor is a definite mix of
people who are aware of these issues
and then people who maybe haven't
been exposed to these issues," she
said.
Eztcorn added that when the
media objectifies women, it also cre-

ates an analogous definition of mas-
culinity. She added that the media
imposes these societal roles, causing
people to ignore complex human
personalities and identities.
Because the media shapes our
view of society, individuals will con-
stantly have a fear of being ostra-
cized if they don't follow societal
standards. Because of our fear of rid-
icule, people compromise on societal
ideals, which results in lack of action
or acknowledgementofitscauseshe
said.
Howard added that society wants
masculinity to be one definite thing,
and that "men are kind of given the
duty to perpetuate and uphold that
strength and power at any cost."

Union planned to
provide 300 million
euros through
research program
JERUSALEM (AP) - Israel
has resolved a diplomatic spat
with the European Union
over a funding ban on insti-
tutions operating in occupied
areas claimed by the Pales-
tinians, Israeli officials said
Tuesday..
The dispute had shaken
Israel's relations with Europe,
its biggest trading partner,
and drawn attention to Isra-
el's much-maligned policy of
building settlements in the
West Bank and east Jerusa-
lem. The Palestinians claim
both areas, captured by Israel
in the 1967 Mideast war, as
parts of a future independent
state.
The dispute surrounded the
EU's "Horizon 2020" program,
which enables participants to
apply for funds for research
and collaboration in areas such
as climate change, renewable
energy and food safety. The
EU has budgeted more than 70
billion euros for the program,
which is to run from 2014 to
2020, and officials estimate
that Israel could gain 300 mil-
lion euros from the complicated
funding system over the seven-
year period.
While Israel has long
participated in similar pro-
grams, the EU has added
some tough language to its
eligibility guidelines to pre-
vent funding for projects in
the West Bank, east Jeru-
salem and other territories
captured by Israel in the 1967
Mideast war.
"The EU does not recognize
Israel's sovereignty over any
of the territories ... and does
not consider them to be part o
Israel's territory," according to
the guidelines.

Israel had feared the guide-
lines would make it ineligible
for much of these funds since
most universities and research
centers have some activities in
the West Bank or east Jerusa-
lem.
Late Tuesday, Israel
released what it said was a
joint statement with the EU,
saying that the compromise
had been reached through dis-
cussions between Justice Min-
ister Tzipi Livni and the EU's
foreign policy chief, Catherine
Ashton.
"The agreement fully
respects the EU's legal and
financial requirements while at
the same time respecting Isra-
el's political sensitivities and
preserving its principled posi-
tions," the statement said. "The
agreement will allow Israel's

scientific community to benefit
from one of the most important
EU programs and facilitate its
further integration into the
European space of research and
innovation."
The statement did not pro-
vide details on the compromise.
But the Israeli daily Haaretz
reported that it included an
Israeli statement objecting to
aspects of the guidelines, as
well as pledges to ensure that
EU funds be spent only in Israel
proper, and not in the occupied
territories.
The dispute with the EU
had unnerved the Israeli gov-
ernment, which was caught
between its continuing sup-
port for the settlements and
preserving the country's
status as a high-tech power-
house.

Scan the Michigan men's
basketball team's bench during
a game. Coach John Beilein sits
at the end, closest to half court.
Next to him are the assis-
tant coaches, who alternate
between shouting out instruc-
tions and jotting down notes on
clipboards.
And closer to the base-
line but directly next to the
assistant coaches typically sit
redshirt junior forward Jon
Horford and fifth-year senior
Jordon Morgan - in many
ways, extensions of the coach-
ing staff.
On a young team dominated
by sophomores, Horford and
Morgan play an important role
for the Wolverines by provid-
ing a voice of leadership.
After falling to Iowa State in
a hostile road environment and
getting upset by Charlotte in
the championship game of the
Puerto Rico Tip-Off, Michigan
- a team that didn't lose its first
game until January last season
- is in desperate need of some-
one to step up and take charge.
This year, though, there's
no obvious answer. Trey Burke
and Tim Hardaway Jr., who
indisputably shared the spot-
light and the leadership last
season for the Wolverines, left
for the NBA.
Sophomore guard Nik Staus-
kas leads the team in scoring
and has been Michigan's most
impressive player, and sopho-
more forward Mitch McGary
brings a level of energy to the
court that betters everyone on
the floor. But neither has taken
it upon himself to be the clear
general both on and off the
hardwood.
The 22nd-ranked Wolver-
ines (4-2) must look towards
their bench for leadership.
Horford and Morgan are the
two oldest members on the
squad, and their roles as lead-
ers won't diminish though
their minutes have been cut
back since McGary returned
from an injury.

"I just think we have a per-
spective of this team that's
kind of the last of what was of
Michigan basketball," Morgan
said. "We've seen the good and
the bad, and we know what it
takes to make it to where we've
gotten - Big Ten Champion-
ship, National Championship
appearance. So I think we just
kind of do a good job of keeping
everybody focused."
Morgan knows the impor-
tance of him stepping up as an
upperclassman. In his firstyear
playing after he redshirted his
freshman year, Morgan didn't
have an older teammate to look
up to - there wasn't a single
senior that season.
"I think both of them are
leaders by example," Beilein
said. "(Horford) may be a little
more vocal than (Morgan), but
the amount of time they spend
on their own working out is a
message to everybody. We're all
about self-improvement, and
they're great examples ofit."
Beilein believes in their abil-
ity to lead and leans on them to
provide mentorship. He named
both of them, along with soph-
omore forward Glenn Robin-
son III, team captains.
"There may be times when I
say, 'Hey Jordan, talk to (soph-
omore guard) Spike (Albrecht)
about something, or talk to
some of the younger guys about
something,' " Beilein said.
"Because they're the best at
knowing what we think."
A respected voice of leader-
ship coming from someone in a
uniform - not a suit - will be
important for Michigan as it
approaches conference play. To
be competitive in the Big Ten,
the Wolverines need more than
just solid performances on the
court.
"I'm at the point now where
it's not enough to necessar-
ily lead by example," Morgan
said. "I have to be very vocal in
practice. I have to step outside

Heather treats AA

Local bakery tailors
cakes to customers'
artistic tastes
By GIANCARLO BUONOMO
Daily Arts Writer
Shows like "Ace of Cakes" and
"Cake Boss," which chronicle
the day-to-dayoperations of suc-
cessful bakeries, occupy a wildly
popular niche in food television.
Why do people like watching
shows about cake? Besides the
obvious pleasure of watching a
large Italian-American family
schmooze with each other, these
shows satisfy on both the gusta-
tory and aesthetic levels.
On the one hand, they are
pure food porn: Layers of ten-
der cake are lovingly smothered
with gobs of creamy frosting and
studded with insulin-raising
amounts of sugary decorations.
On the other hand, cake decora-
tors, with just some fondant and
food coloring, produce products
so creative and intricate that it is
hard to not call them art.
But this delectable dichotomy
doesn't exist solely on TV. Here
in Ann Arbor, baker Heather
Anne Leavitt acts as both a
craftswoman and an artist at her
shop, Sweet Heather Anne on
North Main - roles that "have
equal importance."
Sweet Heather Anne pro-
duces a wide variety of baked
goods, from shortbread, to
"cake in a jar." However, the
shop has become best known
for its custom-designed cakes.
No two cakes are exactly the
same, because no two clients are

exactly the same.
"We try to work with the
client and get out what they
like about certain cakes and
then design something new for
them," Leavitt said.
These designer-client dia-
logues have produced an eclec-
tic portfolio for Sweet Heather
Anne. Cakes run the gamut
from the classically beautiful
floral cakes for weddings, to a
cake in the shapes of a steak and
baked potato.
After seeing the cakes, it's
hard to not call them art, and
whoever makes them an art-
ist. But despite your opinion
on whether cakery is a proper
artistic medium, Leavitt is an
artist in her own right, having
received a degree from the Uni-
verity's School of Art & Design.
Fittingly, her undergraduate
work revolved mostly around
sculpture - of a non-edible vari-
ety. But while studying abroad
in Italy, the edible became her
passion.
"Itwas the first time that I
had thought as much about food
and cooking, because it was just
so pervasive in the culture,"
Leavitt said.
Back in America, Leavitt com-
bined her love of food and her
sculpting skills into a senior the-
sis, for which she made edible
monuments for the Ann Arbor
food producers she sought out
upon her return. After gradu-
ation, she worked in savory
restaurants for several years,
which, like art school, provided
her with skills rather than reci-
pes.
So, cake is just a new mate-
rial for Leavitt, more delicious

and marketable than wood or
bronze.
Sweet Heather Anne has
tried to make itself even more
appealing, though, through its
emphasis on local and seasonal
products. Rather than use mass-
produced ingredients, Leavitt
has established relationships
with local farmers and purvey-
ors for many of the shop's culi-
nary staples.
"I love how I go every year to
get a certain thing from a certain
person; I think that's really spe-
cial," Leavitt said.
For example, the pumpkin
cakes and pies use fresh pump-
kin from Tantr6 Farm, which is
only 20 miles from Ann Arbor
and is sold only in autumn.
"I think that a lot of people
enjoy that kind of connection
and understanding where it's
coming from," Leavitt added.
Sweet Heather Anne is a busi-
ness that is constantly evolv-
ing as the seasons come and go
and as new customers arrive
with neweideas for cakes. But
this constant evolution raises
an almost philosophical ques-
tion: How does the designer of a
work of art, like a cake, contend
with the fact that no matter how
beautiful and unique the piece
is, it will eventually be cut and
devoured?
"As an artist, I kind of like it,"
Leavitt said. "I think that the
eating part is actually part of
the process for me. We make so
much artwork, and I kind of love
the fact that it's not piled up in
some garage. I like that we can
do these special projects that
have a special meaning for a spe-
cial day."

SThe Simpsons' still going
strong after 25 seasons


By GRACE PROSINEWSKI
DailyARTS WRITER
What'syour favorite TVshow?
It's a question that invariably
comes up, whether in icebreak-
ers for class or small talk with a
stranger. My answer to this ques-
tionhasbeenthesamefor20years:
"The Simpsons." The response I
get has been the same for almost
as long.
First,thereis amomentofincre-
dulity, which I find odd because
it's almost like we're all expected
to have flying hellfish tattoos to
identifyusorsomething. Then, the
dreaded, completely predictable
utterance, "Yeah, I used to watch
that. You know, when it was still
good."
Sigh.
If I had a dollar for every time
someone has said that to me, well,
let's just say I wouldn't need a col-
lege degree. And the way they say
it! How their voices drip with the
self-satisfaction of supposed cul-
tural superiority. Iusually justnod
and change the subject. But what
I really want to do is explain how
wrongthey really are.
I'm not here to argue whether
the show has suffered a decrease
in quality or consistency. That
conversation is for a different day,
preferably after several strong
drinks. What I'm saying is that it's
asinine to criticize something that
you haven't watched in 10-plus
years.
There's almost this idea that
watching "The Simpsons" now

that's simply not the case. It's a this argument also don't take the

Anything goes at
midnight showings

Boring, impotent'Delivery'

State Theater
provides cult
classics for A'
By TYLER BAILEY
DailyArts Writer
For almost as long as the
phenomenon of cult movies
has existed, so too have these
strange, offbeat and sometimes
downright terrible films found
a home at midnight screenings.
It could be that the mythos of
the midnight hour meshes with
the appeal of the cult film move-
ment, because this combination
has been a hit nationwide and
in Ann Arbor. The city has been
at the forefront of the midnight
movie scene with the State The-
ater offering frequent midnight
screenings since the late '80s.
However, it is not just the off-
beat appeal of the midnight hour
that has audiences coming back
most Saturdays. Brian Hunter,
programming manager of the
State Theater, has been making
sure that viewers are served a
steady diet of classic cult films as
well as a complete social expe-
rience unlike any other trip to
the movies (that happens before
midnight, that is).
"I definitely think that things
can get weirder; I want the mid-
nights to feel like a party," Hunt-
er said. "My dream is for it to feel
like, even if you're seeing 'The
Goonies,' that you feel like it's
the first time you've ever seen it,
and it's the weirdest time you've
ever seen it."
While many patrons have
already seen multiple films that
are popular fare for midnight
screenings, the experience

offered by the State Theater is
worlds away from the experi-
ence of popping in a favorite
DVD or, more likely, queuing
up a strange, foreign thriller on
Netflix.
After purchasing tickets and
climbing the stairs to the State's
two screens on the second floor,
eager guests are in for a moviego-
ing encounter unlike any other.
Before every midnight screen-
ing, State Theater employees
introduce the film, often joking
and making insider references,
as well as a list of other upcom-
ing films. Unlike a Hollywood
film screening, audience partici-
pation is encouraged. Regulars
and newcomers shout out their
favorite lines, make jokes around
the on-screen dialogue or even
bring props related to specific
moments in the film. While this
behavior would most likely get
you the boot at a theater like
Rave or Quality 16, the State
Theater embraces this tradition
with open arms.
"It's really fun when the audi-
ence brings itto us," Hunter said.
"A midnight audience, if they're
in touch with the film, they
know what to do for it."
Audience participation is even
encouraged outside the physical
boundaries of the State's walls.
Due to the rip-roaring frontier-
like nature of midnight movies
at the State, there is always an
avenue for film enthusiasts to
suggest a screening of a classic
favorite or a new, strange lim-
ited release for consideration as
a part of the series.
"E-mail me! I can't say that
enough," Hunter said. "I'm more
than happy to hear what people
want to see. I want Ann Arbor to
have a fun midnight scene."

While nothing seems off-lim-
its in terms of audience behavior,
limits aren't even considered in
regard to the films that can, and
are, shown as part of the mid-
night programming. Though
midnight classics such as "The
Rocky Horror Picture Show,"
"Eraserhead" and "Donnie
Darko" have become a tradition,
the midnight series has given
audiences the chance to see more
experimental, lesser known and
even avant-garde films.
"There's nothing that I
wouldn't even consider show-
ing," Hunter said. "I think it's
all about experience; it should be
about stretching your boundar-
ies, what you're comfortable or
uncomfortable with. I do think
the midnight audience is willing
to take chances on things."
At midnight, it can be bet-
ter to go outside a comfort zone
or see something that pushes
boundaries instead of the daz-
zling Hollywood blockbuster
that is guaranteed to wow audi-
ences. At midnight, it might be a
better choice to see a crude, ter-
ribly made bust than a critically
acclaimed four-star thriller.
However, even with these dif-
ferences, one thing remains the
same: At midnight, a film should
give you an emotional reaction
just the same as it should any
time of day.
"You should leave the theater
either happy that you stayed up
and you went with your bud-
dies or leave the theater and
just be beside yourself because
you feel something," Hunter
said. "I think movies, in general,
but especially midnight mov-
ies, work on that visceral level.
You should feel something from
them."

audience mem-
bers who accept
its silly premise and plot contriv-
ances will leave the theater feel-
inguplifted.
In "Delivery Man," the ami-
cable but perpetually unreliable
meat truck driver David Wozniak
(Vince Vaughn, "Wedding Crash-
ers") can't get his life together.
He owes money to the mob, his
pregnant girlfriend wants to raise
their child on her own, he grows
pot in his apartment and disap-
points his family with airheaded
decisions.
When David discovers that
the excessive sperm donations he
made in his youth resulted in him
fathering 533 different children
and that 142 filed a class action
lawsuit to uncover his identity, it
seems things will only get worse.
However, David soon discovers
that his oversized family may
actually provide the sense of pur-
pose he needs.
When David receives a file
containing the profiles of his
children, his curiosity wins out
and he begins secretly checking
up on them. This part of "Deliv-
ery Man" plays out in an episodic
manner, with each newly found
offspring presenting a mini-dra-
ma. one might easily imagine
this premise working as the plot
of a television series, where David
solves another of his children's
problems each episode.

feast your eyes: the dark side of cocktails by sienawitte

"For women in business, it's more than a numbers game"
By Akshay Seth
"33% in Ross? That's nothing in comparison to Computer
Science and Engineering where it's 20%."
- USER: Mike Leroy

It was a orisi winter mgnt: swas
running across a dimly-lit parking
lot on the corner of Ashley and
Huron. Hobbling past the large
group of fellow goer-outers, I leapt
over the concrete divide and saw
the rest of my party dart into an
invisible doorway on the side of an
unmarked building. Where the hell
are we going? I caught up, scuttling
down the street in heels half a size
too big. On top of a building, a black
and white letter board haphazardly
spelling "THE LAST WORD 5 P.M.
- 2 A.M." caught my eye. I ducked
into the dimly lit door frame
beneath the sign.
In an instant, I had fallen down
Ann Arbor's very own rabbit hole,
an underground hotbed of mixol-
ogy magic and handcrafted cock-
tails. After wiping the sweat off my
brow and readjusting my various
layers, I found myself face-to-face
with a gentleman clad in a white
dress shirt, orchestratingthe eve-
ning next to a sign that read "Please
wait tobe seated" in dark, scripted
letters. Paneledbookshelves lined
the walls as we weaved our way
through elderly couples and youths,
nestled in the dark corner booths,
all ages sportingbeards - so
manybeards. Tea lights flickered
againstthe wood-paneled walls,
shining on finely aged liquids in
tall-necked glasses. It was as if the

buck-young Ann Arbor had finally
been wrangled by a man she met
at a rare book store, moved into
a chic loft overlooking the meat-
packing district of Manhattan, and
now roamed the streets clad in
sleek cargo trousers and patterned
sweaters that merely hinted at her
wild youth.
As expected of such a refined
lady of rebellion, the menu was
leatherbound and resembled a
short novel more than a list of food
and beverage offerings. After mak-
ing my way through the Table of
Contents (chapter listings and glos-
sary included), I flipped through
page after page of exotic cocktails,
trying mybest to think if the bold
combination of brandied cherry
juice and Aztec chocolate bitters
would pique my taste buds more
than the somewhat smoother elixir
of gin and champagne. One of my
companions, however, was still
on the fence, wondering whether
to get the unconventional and
zesty Osborn with fresh jalapeno
or the Penicillin that was up to
its eyeballs in Scotch. I expected
an all too excited regurgitation
of "They're both great!" from
our waiter, as per the unwritten
rules of customer service. To my
surprise, however, she looked up
from her notepad and explained
that while the Penicillin was cer-
tainly satisfactory, it was truly the
Osborn's perfect balance of bite
and sweetness that made it her
drink of choice.
With smiles on our faces and
eager anticipation for our dan-
gerously delicious cocktails, we
delved into a world of culinary
accomplices that have forever
been engrained in my memory -
also known as appetizers. What
arrived were more or less fancy
open-faced grilled cheeses topped
with fresh herbs. It wasn't long_
before the app from heaven was

gone, both melting and breaking
my heart with its fleeting fickle-
ness - much like a childhood
friendship kindled in the stale
heat of a summer camp Rec Room.
I was overwhelmingly struck with
a feeling of love and loss as I grit-
ted my teeth and politely offered
the last bite away. #regret
It seemed like the Last Word
could do no better, until our drinks
arrived. A lone thread of salty Par-
mesan hanging from my lower lip,
my jaw slacked mid-bite; I looked
up at the waitress as she bestowed
upon us our cocktails. Mine: a tall,
glowing glass of gin and cham-
pagne, a single basil leaf adorning
the rim. And my companion's: a
short stub of a Tiki mug sprouting
a blue paper umbrella. My eyes
widened and I chuckled to myself.
It seemed the impossible became
possible - both the luxury of aged
alcohol and the candid kitschy-
ness of a tourist souvenir came to
coexist.
Just when In .-

just when you
thought you had her all boxed
up and tucked neatly away, she
shook her finger with a mischie-
vous smile, giving you a "Tsk,
tsk" for trying to tie her down as
solely lavish. In one fell swoop,
we were reminded that there
was no room for judgment, for
wondering if Tiki mugs should or
shouldn't be served in an other-
wise luau-less environment. This
was more than just a drink, more
than just a night out on the town
- it was a chance to indulge in
liquid peppers, to huddle around
a flaming bowl of "lots of rum ...
and more rum." It was a chance to
break all the rules - at least until
last call.

Waring, Bank and Ko constantly attempt
to influence policy in conjunction with the
University's best interests.
Lobbying - a term supposedly coined
by President Ulysses Grant in the 1870s
as political suitors vied for the President's
attention in the lobby of Washington's
swanky Willard Hotel - is often associat-
-med with the highly endowed K-street firms
that push deals with senators in smoke-
filled back rooms.
But according to Waring, the Univer-
sity's interactions are much broader than
tussles over the latest House resolution.
"Most advocacy is explaining how
things work to policymakers," Waring
said. "Because they can't make good policy
unless they understand how their deci-
sions are going to affect various groups."
Public Policy Prof. Richard Hall said
lobbyists are often seen as those who wield
,_ampaign contributions to sway policy.
However, 501(3)(c) organizations - like
the University - are legally barred from
making campaign contributions.
"They don't like to use the word lobby
because that has special meaning," Hall
said. "They use words like 'educating
policymakers,' which is what a lot of lob-
byists do. I think higher education policy
would be worse if you didn't have repre-
sentatives from higher education institu-
tions in the process."
Hall said rather than coercing poli-
ticians to take positions they wouldn't
otherwise, most advocacy organizations
target politicians already supportive of
their cause, trying to convince them to
promote that stance.
In a city that runs on networks, War-
ing and Bank have spent years cultivating
relationships. Their networks span across
congress, the White House and agencies
like the National Science Foundation and
NIH.
A sumber of current Obama adminis-
tration officials are University alumni,
including Cecilia Munoz, director of the
White House Policy Council, and the
president's advisor on education, Roberto
Rodriguez. Both recently spoke on cam-
pus and often work with Waring and Bank
on federal policy.
"As much as we're in the University
business, we're in the people business,"
Waring said. "It's relationships. It's peo-
ple we get to know here in Washington
because when we want to go talk to them,
we want them to be glad we've walked in
the door. They know who we are. They
like us. We like them. We've got this rela-
0--ionship and now we can have a conversa-
tion. Their boss might not vote the way we
want them to vote, but what we are doing
is creating an environment to have that
discussion."
Wilbanks agreed, noting real oppor-
tunities to influence policy emerge from
30relationships molded over long periods.
"The fact is that having staff on the
ground in Washington D.C. gives us an

opportunity over many years to develop
strong relationships with the members
themselves, and equally important, is an
opportunity to have long term relation-
ships with staff," Wilbanks said.
In this way, the University's D.C. office
rarely engages in crisis communication or
calls upon a contact just as a crucial bill
comes to the floor. Rather, congressmen
and their staffs are lobbied constantly.
But even with regular communication,
Wilbanks said the D.C. staff is always
attentive to the legislative agenda, keeping
an eye on opportunities for amendments
that could benefit the University and other
higher education institutions.
The University's interactions in these
spaces are less a favor-for-favor exchange

icy, they make sure we know about it in

For example, during his last State of the
Union, President Obama emphasized the
significance of American manufacturing
and called for the formation of several insti-
tutes to pursue manufacturing innovations.
Currently, the state of Michigan is in the
running for one of these facilities, and the
University is taking the lead in crafting the
state's proposal.
Jordan said it is important Michigan's
congressional delegation has all the infor-
mation they need to focus the Obama
administration's attention on the state's
proposal.

"Up here, accurate information is
the coin of the realm ... What we
really need in order to be effective
is accurate and useful information.
If there is something going on at

advisor for Rep. Sander Levin (D-Mich.)

interaction with Washington to the benefit of
the University."
The D.C. team even assists faculty by
reviewinglanguage in their testimony or pars-
ing through dense, legislative jargon.
"I can't say enough about how important
and how skilled and knowledgeable our Wash-
ington staff is at advocating for the University
of Michigan and the work we do back here in
the state," Molnar said.
Molnar, whose institute focuses on econom-
ic development, not only travels to the capital
to advocate research funding for his institute,
but also to advise members of the federal
government on an array of topics. Currently,
Molnar is working with the Department of
Defense to mitigate the effects of decreasing
military contracts in certain communities.
He said a steady flow of information from
researchers in the field is an invaluable
resource for policymakers.
"They need to depend on reliable informa-
tion from sources they trust to get the knowl-
edge to allow them to do their jobs," he said.
Little part of the world
On nice days, Bank often walks over to the
Longworth House Office Building to grab a
salad for lunch.
In these spaces, she gets a lot of work done
by accident. She'll often run into a congres-
sional staffer, they'll chat and get a meeting
arranged. Advocacy happens all the time -
at social events, on the Hill and in the cafete-
ria at Longworth.
"Those little things happen every day,"
Bank said.
For faculty and administrators in Ann
Arbor, a meeting in D.C. requires planning
weeks in advance. Waring, Bank and Ko can
get to ahearing in five minutes.
The University's field office has become
part of Washington's landscape, a city pop-
ulated by the nation's top policymakers.
Whether the current issue is sequestration
or immigration reform, Waring said creat-
ing a presence for the University remains
important.
"Our goal is still to paint the picture of
what the University is all about - how we
can be successful, how we can help the state
and the country - and how hopefully Con-
gress and these agencies can be a partner in
that," Waring said.
There's a lot at stake. The faculty mem-
ber's groundbreaking research proposal, the
undergraduate's student loan debt and the
future of the University's next great partner-
ship - these roads all cross in a tiny sliver of
former swampland between Maryland and
Virginia.
It becomes clear why the University's D.C.
office takes their conference room Capitol
view so seriously.
"The bottom line is that the University
has been here for almost 200 years, and my
guess is it will be here 200 years more," War-
ing said. "So we're just a small piece of that
success and the success of the University
goes beyond our little part of the world. Our
job is to make our little piece of it works."

A CAPITOL VIEW:
The D.C. fight to maintain federal
research funding / By Sam Gringlas

Through the windows, the dome
of the U.S. Capitol commands the
skyline, perched just a few blocks
up Capitol Street Southwest.
At the University of Michi-
gan Washington, D.C. office, the
focus on location is apparent. For the staff,
working from Washington isn't just conve-
nient; it's essential.
It's in the District of Columbia - not Ann
Arbor - where the University has constant
access to legislators and policymakers, the
White House and congressional staff. The
University's Washington staff members are
well positioned to advocate on the Univer-
sity's behalf. In Washington, friends of the
University have the clout to attach a cru-
cial amendment or adjust a vital regulation.
Though they might not know it, University
faculty, students and administrators are
depending on a staff over 500 miles away
- for research dollars, flexible student loan
policy and lenient immigration laws.
In Michigan, Capitol Hill may seem dis-
tant, but at the University's D.C. office, it's
just down the street.

to attend the University and then stay in the
United States.
But perhaps most importantly, federal
research funding is a high-stakes priority
for the University, the nation's second larg-
est research institution in terms of research
dollars. As effects of the federal sequestra-
tion loom, the University must constantly
remind its congressional delegation the
importance of federal research funds.
In fiscal year 2013, the University logged
record-breaking research expenditures,
totaling $1.33 billion. However, federal
funding accounts for 62 percent of Univer-
sity research dollars. Though the University
reported increases in certain areas of fed-

federal government. From Washington, Ko
advocates on behalf of the University's vast
research interests and relays updates on
federal funding and regulations related to
research.
It is difficult to isolate the sequestration's
impact on specific grants. When a research-
er receives word funding has been cut, Ko
said, the notice does not state "due to the
sequestration."
"But we can make certain assumptions,"
she said.

"The funding is going to continue

going to have here. And it's tied

ers could enter 2014 facing a 7.5-percent
decrease in NIH funding. This could trans-"-
late into a $25 million loss at the Medical
School and $37.5 million at the campus level.
"It will add continued pressure to down-
size the number of laboratories, faculty
hires and graduate and post-doctoral train-
ing slots," Athey said. "This is just coming at,
a time when the potential future discover-
ies in biomedical research are more exciting
than ever."
Athey said he approves of the University's
efforts to fight the sequestration, but noted it
is important to lobby congressional Repub-
licans. Ann Arbor's representative, John
Dingell (D-Ann Arbor) has already voiced
discontent with the sequestration, arguing
the University must target those standing in
the way of safeguarding funding.
Ko said University researchers often call
the Washington office to offer assistance in
advocating on behalf of University research'
and they understand the University is work-
ing to fight sequestration's tide.
"They understand we're not putting these
cuts in and, frankly, we're not the ones who
are going to reverse them," Ro said.
Sarah Walter, Michigan State University's
associate vice president for governmental
affairs based in Washington, said MSU lob-
bies the Michigan congressional delegation
in similar ways and frequently collaborates
with the University's office, located down
the hall in 499 S. Capitol St. SW.
Before heading MSU's D.C. office, Wal
ter served in the same position as Ko at
the University.
At MSU, federal research funding
accounts for 49 percent of research
expenditures.
Last year, Washington officials from
Wayne State, MSU and the University
brought the congressional delegation to
Michigan to tour the three-university
research triangle. Staff and University offi-
cials sought to highlightthe state's many
research achievements, as well as discuss
the sequestration and impact of federal
funding.
As much as universities work together
to emphasize the importance of federal
research funding to Congress, the seques-
tration is a wide-reaching issue pulled by a
multitude of forces.
"The funding is going to continue to be
the biggest fight we're going to have here,"
Waring said. "And it's tied to this macro
debate about how big government should be.
So we're going to have to figure out how we
maneuver through those stormy waters."

To accomplish these goals, the Wash-
ington team works diligently to keep the
University's priorities on the minds of law-
makers and their staffs, especially members
of Michigan's delegation.
