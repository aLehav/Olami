This semester, LSA sophomore 
Grace Miller is enrolled in 
Electrical 
Engineering 
and 
Computer Science 281, a higher-
level computer science class 
that introduces students to data 
structures and algorithms. This 
course is the fourth EECS class 
Miller has taken at the University 
and 
has 
a 
much 
smaller 
enrollment 
than 
the 
other 
introductory computer science 
class, EECS 183.
Like many students in project-
based computer science courses, 
Miller relies on office hour help 
to complete assignments. EECS 
courses are taught by professors 
and Graduate Student Instructors 

as well as Instructional Aides, 
upper-level undergraduates who 
have succeeded in past EECS 
classes. 
Miller 
said 
limited 
staff and long wait times on the 
“queue,” a virtual line that tells 
students how long they have 
to wait to have their questions 
answered, often make the process 
time-consuming and frustrating.
“Last week I waited in the 
queue for three hours without 
getting help,” Miller said. “If there 
are a lot of people, they’ll have to 
help everyone at once so then you 
can’t ask specific questions, or you 
are waiting in this line for a really 
long time. I know they want to 
help you, but they really don’t have 
the capacity to sometimes.”

Around 550 University of 
Michigan students and Ann Arbor 
residents 
filled 
Mendelssohn 
Theatre Saturday night for the 
Korean 
Student 
Association’s 
annual 
Culture 
Show, 
an 
exhibition of Korean culture with 
performances from singing to 
martial arts. This year’s theme 
for the show was “Find Your 
Seoulmate.”
Culture Show Co-Chair Ciara 
Timban, a Public Health junior, 
said the show was a long time in 
the making.
“We’ve been working on this 
since probably the summer,” 
Timban said. “This is one of our 
biggest events of the year.”
University 
student 
groups 
relating 
to 
Korean 
cultural 

practices 
performed 
at 
the 
Culture Show under the umbrella 
organization KSA. KSA’s primary 
objective forthe show was to 
display 
Korean 
values 
and 
practices to an audience who may 
not be familiar with them.
“(What) I want people to take 
away is a sense of representation 
and recognition, being able to 
recognize people who are also 
passionate about Korean culture 
if they themselves are Korean-
American or Asian-American,” 
Timban said. “I love just being 
able to see a little bit of the 
representation of diversity that 
exists on campus. I feel like a lot 
of the time, people forget that 
there are a lot of diverse, different 
cultures and even within Korean 
cultures, a lot of diversity between 
modern Korean culture and more 
traditional things too.”

The show began with the 
South Korean national anthem 
and the performances followed, 
each exhibiting Korean culture 
through a different medium.
Pharmacy 
senior 
Angela 
Chen, 
an 
audience 
member, 
told The Daily after the show 
that she enjoyed the diversity of 
performance.
“I’m personally not involved in 
anything cultural on campus, so 
it’s cool to see what other people 
are doing with their time,” Chen 
said.
The first performance was 
by Sinaboro, a traditional Asian 
drumming group at the University. 
One of the percussionists, LSA 
junior Kariana Alvarado, said 
the group was eager to have an 
audience for their work.
“This is the first performance 
for our whole group,” Alvarado 

said. “We train and teach the 
pieces the fall semester and then 
everyone gets to perform for the 
first time in the KSA Culture 
Show. This is our debut as a full 
ensemble. This is our first stage 
and we try to pump it up like, 
‘Alright, guys. We’re going to do 
well.’ That’s why we like to do the 
KSA show.”
Traditional performances were 
juxtaposed against more modern 
acts such as K-pop dancing, 
rapping and a parody of popular 
Korean drama “What’s Wrong 
with Secretary Kim,” recorded 
and performed by KSA members 
that was played in-between live 
acts. 

On 
Friday 
afternoon, 
about 30 Rackham students 
and 
post-doctoral 
fellows 
attended 
a 
conversation 
about 
student-led 
diversity 
initiatives and inclusivity with 
Damon Williams, author and 
chief 
catalyst 
for 
Strategic 
Diversity Leadership & Social 
Innovation. The conversation 
took place during the Rackham 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
Symposium, which included 
a panel of student diversity 
leaders and a keynote address 
delivered by Williams.
The symposium aimed to 
create a sense of community 
among 
DEI 
leaders 
and 
highlight the work Rackham 
students are doing to make 
the 
school 
more 
inclusive 
and accepting. The event was 
also run by the Professional 
Development DEI Certificate 
Program, 
which 
began 
in 
2017 and prepares Rackham 
students to become engaged 
with DEI work once they are in 
the workforce.

Madeleine Albright, LSA professor Juan Cole discuss history of global politics 

Former Secretary of State 
Madeleine Albright spoke Friday 
in a packed Michigan Theater 
about her book “Fascism: A 
Warning.” 
History 
professor 
Juan Cole, known for his work in 
Middle Eastern and South Asian 

studies, led a discussion focused 
on the rise of modern fascism, 
Albright’s experience as State 
Department head and Albright’s 
thoughts on world politics today.
Albright’s book focuses on the 
history of fascism, its role in the 
20th century and the dangers of 
extreme nationalism currently 
seen around the world. Albright 

discussed her understanding of 
fascism as outlined in her book.
“(Fascism) is when there is 
a set of anger going on and the 
leader comes along and decides 
to identify himself with one 
group, some nationalist group, 
at the expense of the minority,” 
Albright 
said. 
“When 
there 
are problems, what you try 

to have are leaders that try 
to find common interests and 
try to figure out how to mend 
the bridge. A fascist leader is 
somebody 
that 
exacerbates 
those conditions.”

to combat racial inequality in 
Washtenaw County. 
County Commissioner Felicia 
Brabec, chair of the board’s Ways

with with One Community to 
implement a plan of action working 
both internally and externally.
“What we’re doing is we’re 
looking first internally, make sure 
our house is in order first,” Brabec 
said. “So we’re looking at everything 
from ‘What’s the makeup of our 
boards and commissions? How 
do we hire folks and how do we 
promote folks? Where do we post 
jobs What’s the language that we’re 
using in jobs for each department?’”
One Community is made up of 
court and county administrators, 
racial analysts, public defenders and 
health department workers. Brabec 
said she and One Community work 
to educate people about racial 
inequities within local government.

Across the country, a surge in 
the number of college students 
pursuing computer science degrees 
reflects the strong job market for 
students interested in the field and 
the growing demand for employees 
with computer science skills. With 
1,390 
declared 
undergraduate 
majors in Winter 2017, Computer 
Science is the most popular major in 
the College of Engineering and the 
second most popular by enrollment 
out of all schools at the University.
Introductory 
EECS 
courses, 
along with other large classes 
like Chemistry 210 and Math 115, 
often have three or four lecture 
sections and more than 1,000 
students enrolled in one semester. 
Math 115, an introductory calculus 
course, was the largest LSA class by 
enrollment in Fall 2018 with 1,592 
students, according to University 
spokeswoman Kim Broekhuizen. 
This semester, EECS 183 runs five 
lecture sections and 24 lab groups 
ranging from 15-20 students each.

With 
such 
large 
classes 
primarily offering new material to 
first and second year students, the 
University offers various resources 
— such as the Science Learning 
Center study groups and Math Lab 
walk-in tutoring services — to help 
students acclimate to college-level 
STEM courses. Yet some students 
find that these resources, along 
with EECS office hours, are often 
in such high demand that their 
resources are stretched thin.
Joe Salvatore, director of the 
SLC, said between 60 to 70 percent 
of students in Chem 210, the first 
level of organic chemistry, look to 
the SLC for help with studying for 
exams. Salvatore said with more 
than 3,200 students using the study 
groups each term, it can be difficult 
to physically find the space to help 
the growing number of students 
that request the SLC’s services.
“One of the challenges on campus 
right now is a space crunch,” 
Salvatore said. “There’s building 
going on, but as renovations and 
buildings 
(construction) 
occur 
it takes classrooms and spaces 
offline, so that can be a challenge 

for us because our spaces utilize 
classrooms on Central Campus. 
Just being able to find enough space 
at the time when students want 
to meet in study groups or have 
tutoring appointments can be a 
challenge.”
Students and Instructional Aides 
in EECS courses expressed similar 
concerns about the number of 
students their extra help resources 
have to accommodate. While EECS 
classes take place in buildings 
around Central Campus, the EECS 
department runs office hours in 
the Duderstadt Center on North 
Campus. Though the four floors 
of the Duderstadt offer various 
spaces for office hour help, Vineet 
Jammalamadaka, 
Engineering 
senior and Instructional Aide for 
EECS 183, said the limited number 
of Instructional Aides in the room 
at a given time can be challenging 
when project deadlines are coming 
up.
“You don’t really feel the class 
size as much as during the day 
because we interact with students 
in labs and our office hours, so we 
usually never feel the full force of 
1,000 students, thankfully,” 
Jammalamadaka said. “We 
really feel it near the end 
of a project deadline, when 
students need help and they’re 
stuck on something and the 
office hour queue gets up to 
50 people deep and there’s 
only six of us there, so it’s like 
a tug of war between helping 
each student for as long as we 
can versus getting to as many 
students as possible.”
Jammalamadaka 
said 
being an Instructional Aide 
and engaging with students 
in office hours gives him the 
opportunity to have a direct 
impact on whether they choose 
to pursue computer science in 
the future. Even so, he noted 

it can be difficult to help all the 
students he wants to when there 
are only around four to six IAs per 
office hours session.
“The ideal situation is we’d be 
able to hire more and more staff, 
but we’re limited by the University 
because depending on how many 
students are enrolled in the class, 
we can only have up to a certain 
number of IAs actually work for the 
course,” Jammalamadaka said. “So 
we’re limited by the University in 
that regard. But I think the one real 
change that would help office hours 
is something that we tell students 
is that starting a project early helps 
the students a lot and come to office 
hours earlier.”
Broekhuizen 
confirmed 
Jammalamadaka’s statement in 
regards to courses in LSA. She said 
there is no official policy on the 
number of Instructional Aides per 
class for the College of Engineering, 
however.
Although EECS Instructional 
Aides urge students to come to office 
hours when the projects are first 
released, some students find they 
are still waiting in the queue for a 
long time despite being weeks 
away from the project deadline. 
LSA sophomore Vikram Mathew, 
who is currently enrolled in 
EECS 281, said he went to office 
hours the day the project was 
announced and the day after, but 
found it overcrowded and busy.
“I expected pretty small office 
hours, and I was sitting on the 
floor,” Mathew said. “It was very 
packed. It’s a limitation of (the 
department’s) resource. Some 
people want them to get more 
GSIs, really expand the queues 
out.”

Sometime 
last 
year, 
my 
friends and I were chatting, and 
somehow—I 
don’t 
remember 
how—I had mentioned that my 
name, Monica, is not the name I 
was born with.
A (white) friend asked me what 
it was, and I responded that the 
name I was born with—my Korean 
name—is Yejoo. He opened his 
mouth, tried to pronounce it, 
and asked me what it meant. I 
shrugged and said I didn’t know 
and that it probably meant a grassy 
field, or something.
Currently, I know now that 
that’s not actually what it means. 
I’ve had to ask my mom multiple 
times now because for some 
reason the meaning of my name 
immediately 
slips 
from 
the 
recesses of my mind. It means 
something simple: bright all over.
I 
remember 
during 
this 
conversation, I felt comfortable 
talking about my name. It was 

unlike another time, in another 
place, when I had felt differently. 
—
When I was sixteen, my parents 
and I were able to obtain American 
citizenship. I skipped half a day 
of school to go to a government 
building with my parents and to 
swear on a Bible and repeat the 
Pledge of Allegiance, like I had to 
do every morning at school.
A month later, I was back in 
another nondescript government 
building to get my first name 
officially, legally, changed from 
Yejoo to Monica.
I had been going by Monica 
since 
elementary 
school. 
My 
grandmother had given me this 
name, and out of convenience, I 
had used it for nearly all my life in 
America, only going by Yejoo for 
my family members.
In 
middle 
school, 
I 
felt 
especially insecure about it. I 
had just moved a year before 
in fifth grade. As the new kid, I 
already stuck out. Most people 
had been living here their whole 

lives and were still friends with 
their friends from kindergarten. 
Meanwhile, I had spent two and a 
half years of my life in South Korea 
and moved two times previously 
within New Jersey.
When my Korean name was 
called on the first day of the 
school year, I could feel my cheeks 
burn with embarrassment as the 
teacher mispronounced it and I 
saw my fellow students smirk. 
A beat later, I would stammer, 
asking the teacher to call me by my 
American name, Monica.
The 
same 
mortifying 
situation would happen again 
and again when there was a 
substitute teacher. I would feel 
embarrassment all over again 
for not having a name like Sarah, 
Jessica or Kate.
Sometimes, when my white 
peers would ask me my Korean 
name, it was not out of curiosity; 
when I would tell them, they 
would repeat it back to me, but 
exaggerate it so they were saying 
Yeeeeeeeeejoo instead of Yejoo.

In eighth grade, I requested to 
have my name appear as Monica 
in the school system, rather than 
Yejoo. Eventually, it got done. 
Despite on attendance sheets I 
was still Yejoo Kim, I now had a 
note next to my name that stated, 
“Prefers to go by Monica.”
—
Names can indicate who we are 
to other people often in a way that 
might undermine us or put us at a 
disadvantage.
Take, for example, workplace 
discrimination. Numerous studies 
show anti-Black racism in hiring 
has not changed since 1989 and 
anti-Latinx racism in hiring has 
only decreased slightly since then. 
That was thirty years ago. That 
was the year The Little Mermaid 
came out and the year Taylor 
Swift was born.
In 
one 
study, 
researchers 
created resumes for Black and 
Asian applicants, some of which 
included information that clearly 
marked their racial identity, while 
others were “whitened,” such 

as by having an Americanized 
name. They found 25% of Black 
candidates and 21% of Asian 
candidates received callbacks if 
they had whitened resumes, while 
only 10% of Black candidates and 
11.5% of Asian candidates did 
if they included racial/ethnic 
details.
If a person of color has an 
“ethnic” sounding name, there is 
a likely chance they may not be 
asked for an interview. In fact, 
it’s a pretty high one: companies 
are more than twice as likely to 
call back minority applicants with 
whitened resumes for interviews.
Going by my American name 
was a way to protect myself from 
embarrassment and insecurity 
and mockery. And though it 
wasn’t my intention then, it can 
also protect me from potential 
discrimination from employers.
It’s no coincidence that I 
legally changed my name from 
Yejoo to Monica around the time 
that I felt most insecure about 
my dual identities and wanted to 

emphasize my “Americanness.” 
Now that I feel more comfortable 
about navigating my identity as a 
Korean-American, I sometimes 
think about the possibility of 
having everyone call me by my 
Korean name instead of just 
my family—a thought born out 
of a recent desire to feel more 
“Korean,” But, it’s just a thought, 
and for now, I still go by Monica.
My 
Korean 
name 
hasn’t 
been completely erased from its 
existence. It still sits there, in legal 
documentation. Legally, my name 
is Monica Yejoo Kim. It’s ironic, in 
a way, because Koreans don’t have 
middle names.
While my Korean name has 
been relegated to the backseat, 
and while most of the people who 
know me know me as Monica, my 
Korean name still exists, as long 
as my family still calls me Yejoo, 
and as long as I still remember the 
name I was born with.
So, call me by my American 
name. But, know I have a Korean 
one, too.

Indian-American 
culture 
is 
still fairly new in its development. 
There 
have 
been 
waves 
of 
immigration, but the largest wave 
of Indian-Americans has been 
the current youth generation. But 
representations of our culture go 
between mooching off of Black 
culture while simultaneously being 
an anti-Black culture (I’m looking 
at you, NAV) and this: taking the 
pretty~ bindis, lehengas and saris 
and sprinkling it here and there 
to add some dimension to an 
individual personality to gain social 
capital by feeding into the far-
removed image of exotic and pretty 
culture that many white Americans 
might assume of Indian-American 
culture.
Now, a quick disclaimer: I don’t 
see an issue in South Asian girls 
generally taking pride in their 
culture. The clothes and jewelry, 
as Sruthi said, are art. But when 
it’s a pattern where the only time 
the culture is talked about is when 
it makes you look pretty, or when 
it makes you seem like an Exotic 
Girl Who is Not Like The Other 
Girls… what’s the point? What 
are you actually constructively 
contributing to the culture if that’s 
the only thing you post?
Is this all that there is to Indian 
culture? Even when thinking about 
this, there are parts of me that 
wonder if I’m being too harsh on 
other brown girls. I don’t personally 
partake in it, but for others, maybe 
it’s their way of embracing their 
culture.
But if that’s the case, why are 
there no other ways of embracing 
our culture? Why do we place value 
of what we show the most on what’s 
most liked by a general audience? 
And in an era where social justice is 
more popular, it’s also often framed 
as a radical act.

Culture is an amalgamation 
of stories, shared experiences, 
traditions, and fashion. I know that 
Indian and general South Asian 
culture has more to it than just 
jewelry and pretty clothes because 
the culture I come from is steeped 
in generations of stories and unique 
experiences.
Essentializing displays of Indian 
culture to solely its fashion is more 
harmful because ultimately, you’re 
costuming a culture to remove the 
ethnic specificity of what it actually 
is. I’m not even going to explain 
what Indian or South Asian culture 
“is,” because that could be the topic 
of an anthropological dissertation.
There is an inherent denial of 
children who come from immigrant 
families of how well they know 
their 
cultures. 
It’s 
unrealistic 
to believe that as South Asian-
Americans who are children of 
immigrants, we know our culture 
and our ethnicity the same way 
that our parents do. We’ll never 
know our countries or traditional 
culture the way that a native 
born person would… but that’s 
okay. I promise you, it will be fine. 
It’s absolutely possible to celebrate 
our more unique cultures in more 
constructive ways. There are still 
amazing ways of celebrating a 
diasporic culture. You can learn the 
language of your heritage, celebrate 
the history of ancestors, and engage 
in traditions that bring a sense of 
cultural pride in a country like the 
US (for example, this is what folks 
in Michigan Sahana and the IASA 
do through dance).
Holistically, another way to 
phrase what I’m saying: What 
makes you different from the white 
people who pick and choose parts of 
Indian culture to make themselves 
look prettier or edgier at Coachella?
They do it so their Instagram 
likes will go up and they’ll seem 
worldly 
beautiful. 
What’s 
our 
reason?

In a stern but gentle voice, you 
told me the world wouldn’t see me 
like the white children.
Things were changing, you said, 
but I had to face reality.
And I didn’t believe you.
Until the day I saw my name be-
ing torn apart on a school white-
board. “Mean-akshi,” they wrote, as 
the grace of my given name, Meen-
akshi, seemed nonexistent.
It was my fourth grade teacher 
who laughed along with them.
You looked at me with saddened 
eyes, and told me to shorten my 
name to “Meena.” It was easier to 
pronounce and seemed more West-
ern.
You came to support me in my 
extracurriculars, dressed in your 
traditional Indian salwars, but my 
friends pointed it out. “They look 
like clown pants!” exclaimed a girl 
I knew. I told you to stop coming 
and I could see the disappointment 
in your face. You didn’t understand 
why I refused to embrace you in 
front of my friends.
You cooked me different meals 
every day; sambars and dals, deli-
cacies of my culture, but I threw 
them away. You knew because I 
couldn’t tell you what you packed 
for me. And so you began making 
me “American” food. You wanted 
me to fit in, even though I was push-

ing you away.
You used to talk to me in our 
mother tongue, Tamil. I felt like 
such an alien, speaking a language 
that seemed so guttural and hid-
eous. Why couldn’t we speak an 
elegant language? Like French or 
Spanish? So you stopped, and I 
slowly forgot the language. I saw the 
look in your eyes every time I didn’t 
understand what you were saying.
My peers began to accept me the 
more I pushed you away, so like the 
naive teen I was, I did just that.
But now I know you were right.
I will never be like the other chil-
dren. The world will always see me 
as Indian, but that’s not a bad thing 
at all.
My name is beautiful, you and 
dad named me after my grand-
mother.
Your salwars make you look radi-
ant and fierce, and your food is filled 
with flavor and love.
Tamil is an ancient language with 
history and vibrance, something I 
shouldn’t be ashamed of.
Mom, you were right.
Thank you for supporting me in 
all my extra-curricular activities. 
Thank you for cooking me various 
different types of food to keep me 
healthy and strong. Thank you for 
teaching me the lessons your own 
parents taught you about our his-
tory.
Mom, I’ll never get those years 
back. But I want our culture to be a 
part of our future.

A book that I still clearly re-
member from middle school 
is The Fold by An Na. It tells a 
story of a Korean American girl, 
having conflicted feelings about 
her monolid eyes where her plas-
tic surgery-addict aunt is pushing 
her to get the crease surgery. Ba-
sically, this surgery gives you “the 
fold”, as the title of the novel gives 
away, creating a crease on the up-
per eyelid.
It may be hackneyed, and a to-
tally overdone topic. The whole 
#monolid self-love movements 
on Instagram, and articles like 
“The Beauty of Monolids” by Al-
lure or “22 Gorgeous Girls with 
Monolids” by Buzzfeed are ev-
erywhere on the Internet. In 
2016, a Korean drama called Gob-
lin was aired on TV, and it created 
a social boom, as it was one of 
the first of very few mainstream 
drama series with a mono-lid-
ded leading actress. Things have 
changed a lot. Now, the World 
Wide Web is a treasure trove full 
of self-love for monolid eyes, and 
the key words peppered in every 

beauty article –– gorgeous, beau-
tiful –– seem transformative to 
see mono-lidded Asian women 
praised and represented.
So why do Asian girls still, and 
constantly, strive for that crease?
The magnitude of the Asian 
eyes vanity is actually greater 
than we think. Young Korean 
girls like me grow up in a com-
munity where we are surrounded 
by taunts and cries of dissatisfac-
tion: “Your eyes are so slanted”, 
“Your eyes are not suitable for 
makeup looks”, “You should get 
the double eyelid surgery as soon 
as you’re old enough”. Nowadays, 
those sayings have changed to 
something remotely better… or 
have they?
“Your eyes are pretty for a mo-
no-lidded Asian.”
Westernization is still ever so 
prominent in the cold, unforgiv-
ing media of the unattainable 
beauty standards, and K-pop 
idols are still flashing their elfin, 
anime-like appearances for the 
world to see and approve.
I, too, was once under the pres-
sure of the aesthetics-by-knife 
craze in the midst of ambivalent 
teen angst. All my friends around 

me were getting the double eye-
lid surgery as soon as they turned 
18, and this made me fluctuate 
between two modes of hating my 
monolids and loving them. I tried 
many beauty products such as 
the eyelid glue and tape to create 
what the Westernized media cov-
ets and screams out to be socially 
acceptable - big, round, perfectly 
creased double eyelids.
I look into the mirror. I rub 
my face and stare at my reflec-
tion, where I see a pair of wide, 
smooth, almond-shaped mono-
lid eyes. People say eyes are the 
ultimate literal portal to decide 
beauty standards, but why get 
the inferiority complex simply 
based on what the world may 
prefer? There’s no point in be-
ing self-deprecating. I realized 
I was focusing on what I didn’t 
have rather than knowing what I 
do have. It’s time to embrace my 
Asian features and reconcile that 
there are so many types of beauty 
and ways to be myself. It’s okay to 
flip the world the middle finger - I 
am my own kind of beautiful.
I now embrace the single-lid-
ded, dark brown windows of the 
soul. Beautiful.

Welcome to the sex recession
L

ying on my freshman dorm 

room floor, my hallmates 

and I share our latest 

matches on Tinder. We compare our 

similar options, read out loud our 

ridiculous conversations and laugh 

about our feelings of loneliness. None 

of us had any intention of meeting 

up with our matches because that 

would be too risky and scary. This 

was our new game. We swiped for 

a few hours, received a small ego 

boost and would go on with our day. 

We were putting ourselves out there 

without actually having to deal with 

rejection or in-person consequences.

So if we weren’t meeting up with 

people from Tinder, where were we 

meeting people? It seemed like my 

few friends who entered college in 

long-term relationships kept finding 

new relationships (possible serial 

monogamy) and the rest of us had 

a small amount of random drunk 

hookups at parties each semester. 

We weren’t meeting anyone great 

and the hookups alone were always 

described as bad or unrememberable 

from either our blurry state of mind 

or lack of intimacy.

Ever since the beginning of 

college, there has been this clear 

message: We are in the age of hookup 

culture. Whether it is good or bad it 

is happening and typical in college 

students’ lives. I, and those around 

me, still seem to be active on apps 

like Tinder and Grindr. We speak 

casually about sex and about the 

fact that we have been with multiple 

sexual partners. But with the varied 

amounts of casual sex, we are still 

actively trying to find someone to be 

intimate with, passionate about and 

to have some kind of commitment 

with.

This week, in my psychology 

seminar on emerging adulthood, 

we were discussing the varied 

experiences 
young 
adults 
have 

with love and dating. We read this 

past December’s cover story of The 

Atlantic, where Kate Julian dives 

deep into what she calls the “sex 

recession,” 
the 
current 
climate 

where people are having less sex 

despite increased access to birth 

control, 
education, 
technology, 

porn, masturbation and a variety 

of other resources. I felt so relieved 

to find that there was language and 

terminology for something myself 

and so many other young people are 

experiencing.

This hookup culture dominative 

narrative is not real for everyone who 

is supposedly participating in it. We 

may be having casual sex but not as 

often as portrayed in the media or the 

way we want it to seem to those in our 

lives. Hookup culture has positively 

destigmatized the use of online dating 

apps and sex outside of committed 

relationships and marriage. But who 

is to say this kind of sex is enjoyable?

Participating in casual one-

night hookups is not always what it 

is cracked up to be. There are some 

factors that can create an unenjoyable 

sex experience. For instance, 

when both parties are drunk, 

they are trying to recreate what 

they viewed in porn or they lack 

the information about what the 

other person likes. In addition, 

women already have a difficult 

time enjoying the pleasures of 

sex when they are focusing on 

the way their body looks. In 

the current age of social media, 

where people are posting only the 

best possibly photoshopped images 

of themselves, individuals have 

to fight images of unattainable 

perfection in the bedroom. Also, 

this image of perfection is seen 

in porn, for the ways bodies 

are supposed to look and react. 

The sexual activities may look 

enjoyable for the porn stars in the 

film but in real life they are not 

always that way.

The definition of hooking up is 

vastly different for every person. 

It can range from little sexual 

activities, such as foreplay, to going 

all the way. I’m curious where this 

hookup culture is perpetuated. I 

think probably from a combination 

of social media, movies, TV, music 

and porn. Also, dating apps have 

power 
in 
reinforcing 
hookup 

culture. They make money from ads 

that people swipe through while 

using their application. So, people 

are swiping on these dating apps 

for hours and not actually meeting 

anyone. But they continue to use 

the apps because it seems like this 

is the only way they can find the 

possibility of a sexual or romantic 

connection in our culture. By 

viewing these advertisements while 

swiping, they are participating in 

mindless consumerism that keeps 

these applications in business.

Recently, some new dating 

applications like Hinge and Bumble 

have been created for users to get 

into relationships by encouraging 

people to meet face-to-face and get 

off the app. But in my experience, 

there are fewer people on these apps 

and they are still looking for casual 

sex without really getting to know 

you.

So, seeing that we are in a sex 

recession and having less good 

sex, I think we should be trying to 

challenge the narrative and norms 

of hookup culture and actually try to 

get to know the people we are giving 

pleasure too. I’m not saying you have 

to be monogamous, but being with 

someone and learning who they are 

and what they like will probably 

lead to better experiences. Don’t let 

the fear of rejection stop you from 

putting yourself out there because, 

whether it be online or in person, 

anything you experience will help 

you grow in real life.

FROM THE DAILY

 Encourage clarity for the felony disclosure policy
O

n Feb. 4, the University of Michigan announced a new policy requiring 
employees to disclose current felony charges and convictions within a 
week of the charge or conviction occurring after Feb. 1. If an employee 

fails to report the charge or conviction, they could face potential consequences, 
including the loss of their job. The University’s Human Resources office will review 
employees’ situations on a “case-by-case” basis to determine if any action needs to 
be taken against the employee. While the process itself appears reasonable on its 
face, there are unclear portions of the language and process that could lead to unfair 
treatment of an employee who may or may not have committed a crime. To remedy 
this, the University should implement an amended policy with clear language and 
a transparent process that ensures a fair and comprehensive process for employees.

The University has a clear duty 

to protect its students. However, the 
language of the policy is vague and 
prevents affected employees from 
being fully informed about the policy. 
For employees, this means that there 
is no clear understanding about what 
the consequences for reporting a 
felony are. Additionally, there is 
not a clear timeline establishing 
when an employee will hear from 
Human Resources. For example, 
the policy includes the ill-defined 
phrase “timely manner,” referring 
to when employees will be notified 
about the determination Human 
Resources has made. No timeline is 
put in place for employees, making it 
nearly impossible for them to plan for 
their future if the University chooses 
to take some form of action against 
them. If an employee is terminated, 
they will have no plan to fall back 
on. This could be detrimental to 
the financial well-being of the 
employee. The University could 
easily put a timeline in place to create 
a more comprehensive process for 
employees.

The policy also states that 

“temporary measures” could be 
taken, such as moving the employee 
to an alternate work location. This 
portion of the policy can provide 
immense difficulties for employees, 
especially student employees who 
may not have a vehicle to take them 
to an off-campus location. It also calls 
into question what will happen to 
students if a professor, for example, 
is charged or convicted of a felony. 
Would that class still be taught 
during Human Resources’ review of 
the professor? While it makes sense 
that the University would put some 
sort of temporary measure in place 

to protect students, these measures 
need to be more clearly defined 
for the sake of both employees and 
students.

Lastly, the policy states that 

the University will “conduct a 
review of the disclosure and make 
an 
individualized 
assessment, 

consistent with business necessity.” 
Here, 
the 
phrase 
“business 

necessity” is unclear. What is a 
business necessity? How does the 
University evaluate the connection 
between “business necessity” and 
the alleged crimes of the employee? 
Amending the language of the policy 
to clarify these questions will allow 
employees to understand the basis on 
which their cases will be evaluated.

In addition to the language, 

the process itself is unclear. The 
University should clarify how they 
will assess charges, and furthermore 
give the process of submitting 
charges and convictions some kind 
of interface so that employees have 
a more detailed point of reference. 
If an employee gets charged with or 
convicted of a felony, they are asked 
to fill out an online form. Once this 
form is submitted, the situation will 
be evaluated by Human Resources 
on a “case-by-case” basis. It is 
unclear if the employee is able to 
explain their situation to Human 
Resources in person. When students 
violate the community standards 
set by their housing contracts, they 
go through disciplinary action that 
usually involves several University 
employees. This gives students 
numerous opportunities to explain 
the situation face-to-face. Shouldn’t 
employees be afforded the same 
ability to explain their circumstances, 
especially in a situation when 

employment can be terminated? The 
process should include interactions 
between Human Resource staff 
and employees charged with or 
convicted of a felony to allow for 
open communication about the 
process and provide an opportunity 
for the employee to explain their 
situation in person.

The vagueness of the process and 

criteria is a point of concern. The way 
the process is currently structured 
allows 
for 
an 
uncomfortable 

level of leeway on the part of the 
administration to apply the policy 
in a way that doesn’t align with its 
stated intention — to keep students 
safe. One could imagine a situation in 
which a University employee would 
be terminated to avoid potential 
backlash, even if the employee is 
acquitted. According to Michigan 
Incident 
Crime 
Reporting, 
37 

percent of felony crimes end up being 
cleared. However, an employee 
might find themselves without a 
position at the University because 
they were charged with a crime they 
did not actually commit. While it is 
important to keep students safe, a 
standard of fairness must be used to 
protect the rights of employees.

Protecting students clearly must 

be a priority for the University 
and this policy is a step in the 
right direction. Unfortunately, the 
guidelines for whether action should 
be taken in a given case require that 
the University act in good faith in 
every instance. An amended policy 
that is more specific about what 
kinds of cases qualify as posing a 
danger to students will minimize the 
chance of abuse and give employees 
much-needed peace of mind.

New media, the solution to sensationalism

A

s a journalist, I often think 
about the best way to get 
stories and information to 

people. I try to lead with curiosity 
over sensationalism, and I try to 
posit two opposing ideas equally 
when I speak to someone who has 
come to a different conclusion. 
Recently, 
however, 
traditional 

media has been criticized for 
pushing agendas at the expense of 
honest inquiry. Last month, major 
broadcast companies took a 20 
second snippet of a one hour video 
from an incident at the Lincoln 
Memorial and adjudicated a group 
of teenage boys from Covington 
Catholic High School as racists for 
ostensibly mocking the drumming 
and singing of Nathan Phillips, a 
Native American military veteran.

Not long after, the full video 

surfaced showing that indeed it was 
Phillips who approached the group 
of boys and acted as the aggressor, 
banging a drum in their faces as 
he ploughed through the crowd. 
On “The View,” Whoopi Goldberg 
said “many people admitted they 
made snap judgments before these 
other facts came in.” What America 
witnessed in the Lincoln Memorial 
incident was the sensationalist 
reporting that old media lends itself 
to. From this incident, and many 
others we have seen recently, we 
are witnessing an emergent media 
revolution. This change comes at 
a time when the podcast and other 
long-form, more deliberate and 
contemplative content alleviates 
the pitfalls of politically-biased 
mouthpieces that rush to judgment 
and 
disseminate 
inaccurate 

reporting to attract views or push 
agendas.

Six corporations control 90 

percent of the media in the United 
States, so it’s no surprise that it 
can sometimes appear to a viewer 
that they are being fed a specific 
viewpoint of the world. The 
preponderant cable and network 
news organizations all have an 
undeniable bias, their claims of 
objectivity 
notwithstanding. 

Consumers are guilty as well, as 
our tendencies towards intellectual 
safe zones leave us wading into the 
same political pool that our parents, 
or other life influences, first threw 
us into until we begin to actively 
seek out information that confirms 
our own biases. One viewer sees the 
Covington student Nick Sandmann 
in his red “Make America Great 
Again” hat and knows him to be the 
face of bigotry, and another sees an 
aggressive adult drumming in the 
face of a boy who doesn’t know what 
to do about the crowd and recording 

iPhones encircling him.

The 
major 
shortcoming 
of 

sensationalist media is that these 
dialogues are not unfolding in 
a controlled setting with two 
respectful 
speakers. 
They 
are 

spilling out in the comment sections 
of videos uploaded for clicks and 
views and in traditional media talk 
shows. These talk shows or news 
commentary shows have become so 
predictable in their format that you 
can essentially guess every word to 
come out of the speakers’ mouths 
before they open them.

First, they invite a guest on with 

the weakest, most radical argument 
from the opposing political side. 
Then the host, often a hyper-
articulate or at least aggressively 
assertive and persuasive talking 
head, proceeds to lambast them 
on national television with ad 
hominems, and attempts to use 
this vanquished nematode as the 
standard for the entire political left 
or right. At the end of the segment, 
before a commercial break about 
the Super Bowl, the host looks at the 
camera with a smirk that says, “See? 
This is what they are all like. So you 
should see the folly in their ideas 
and join us!”

What does this accomplish? 

Nothing besides a couple moments 
of polemic entertainment at the cost 
of increased political polarization. 
No important issue dissected, no 
bridge built to a better dialogue 
and 
no 
bipartisan 
solution. 

Unfortunately, this is the kind of 
carnage that skyrockets ratings, 
attracts advertisers and inflates 
network staff salaries. It seems 
this everlasting cycle has ensnared 
American media producers and 
consumers in two opposing echo 
chambers and muddied the aisle, 
preventing anyone from making 
their way across.

Or perhaps not. Jordan Peterson, 

a 
clinical 
psychologist 
and 

philosopher of the intellectual dark 
web, discusses this phenomenon as 
an issue of bandwidth. Talk shows 
and panels supply their guests only 
a few minutes before commercial 
breaks to hash out complex and 
controversial ideas. This shortage 
of time dilutes the conversation 
and incentivizes speakers and 
guests to be quick-witted and 
contentious — but not necessarily 
intellectually honest. The solution 
to this seems to be the long-form 
discussion, now accessed through 
podcasts. In these conversations, 
thinkers can sit for hours, broker 
criticism, concede points from their 
opponents and discuss at length 
issues like the dogmatic elements 

of religion, the issue of free speech 
on college campuses or what to do 
about the dispossessed of developing 
civilizations. 
This 
development 

occured 
because 
of 
a 
new 

technology that allows impromptu 
conversations to unfold in front 
of millions across the world, their 
auditory format allowing consumers 
to engage with the content during 
found time (while they’re walking 
their dog, driving to work or doing 
the dishes). Here, complex issues are 
given a wide pasture to roam. No 
pyrotechnics, no chyron-driven 
“gotchas,” just people addressing 
issues in a thoughtful way.

An American media ecosystem 

that once believed your message 
had to be quick and flashy to get 
views is now learning that podcast 
luminaries like Joe Rogan, Hila 
and Ethan Klein, Dave Rubin and 
Sam Harris are orbited by crowds 
in the millions, eager to hear 
voices from nearly every industry. 
Paleontologists, 
heavyweight 

boxing champions, neuroscientists, 
philosophers, activists and Navy 
SEALS — this diverse field of 
professionals can offer the average 
consumer an insight into some 
of the most novel and fascinating 
ideas anywhere on the planet. 
As much as they are places to 
philosophize, these podcasts also 
handle everyday, headline issues 
and can tease out the truth more 
thoughtfully and sensitively than 
a 90 second panel of loudmouth 
pundits.

In the new media format, the 

Lincoln Memorial incident could 
have been analyzed at length and 
evidenced with the full video 
in proper context. Perhaps the 
host would have watched the 
entire video during the podcast 
and 
commented 
moment-by-

moment about the evolution of the 
conflict. Perhaps the high school 
boys wouldn’t have received death 
threats and viewers would have 
noticed other radical groups at 
the memorial who were actually 
shouting hateful language. Any 
approach other than the impulsive 
and inaccurate commentary that 
was spewed by our leading media 
outlets would have been preferable. 
These new media thinkers, their 
more 
considerate 
format 
and 

the technology they use to reach 
audiences might be just what 
we need to receive and process 
information more responsibly in the 
modern world.

T

he longest shutdown in 

the history of the United 

States has finally come to a 

close, bringing a prosperous period of 

compromise and camaraderie to the 

government. Wait, that’s not right. 

This is the Trump era we’re talking 

about.

Let’s start again. The longest 

shutdown in the history of the United 

States has finally come to a close, and 

now there might be another one. The 

government has been temporarily 

reopened, 
but 
President 
Trump 

has declared if an agreement is not 

reached in three weeks, he will either 

shut the government down again 

or declare a national emergency to 

bypass Congress with his wall scheme.

The Congressional Democrats 

are not willing to fund an ineffective 

and costly wall, but have agreed to 

work on a deal to strengthen border 

security, in contingency with Trump’s 

wishes. Yet Trump is committed to his 

pet project, unwilling to compromise 

even when his own supporters are 

suffering 
from 
the 
government 

shutdown. There wasn’t even enough 

Republican support to pass Trump’s 

wall plan. Democrats and Republicans 

alike were in a frenzy trying to come 

up with a plan to end the government 

shutdown, despite no further ideas 

about the wall.

Even Trump’s supporters are 

fed up with all the disagreements. 

The Washington Post found that 

many of his followers, while still are 

in support of border security, find the 

government shutdown too high of a 

cost and mostly blame Trump for that. 

They sympathize with the thousands 

of government workers who are going 

without pay and are angry at Trump 

for putting his fruitless agenda ahead 

of the well-being of his citizens.

In this time of uncertainty, 

Trump needs to focus on what is 

important: serving the people. And 

he can’t do that if the government is 

shut down, not paying health workers, 

environmental protection workers, air 

traffic controllers — everyday people 

who depend on their government 

salary to provide food for the table and 

services for the public. About 420,000 

critical government employees were 

working without pay. About 380,000 

non-critical government employees 

were sent home without pay during 

the shutdown, and 50,000 were 

called back to work without pay. 

Many were forced to look for part-

time jobs in this time of crisis. In 

solidarity with these workers, more 

than 100 Congress members either 

rejected pay or donated their salaries, 

and are pushing for legislations 

that would dock congressional pay 

during shutdowns. While this is of 

course admirable and does benefit 

many people, it still does not alleviate 

the situation of other government 

workers. The only way to do that is 

to reopen the government and come 

to diplomatic solutions to the current 

issues.

We 
haven’t 
had 
a 
divided 

government since the end of the 

Obama adminstration, which means 

the government is no longer used 

to working with much pushback. A 

Republican-led House, Senate and 

executive branch weren’t exactly 

in dire need of major compromises. 

Don’t get me wrong, Democrats taking 

back the House and reinstating a split 

Congress is definitely a good thing. 

With equilibrium reestablished in 

Congress, the checks and balances 

system can be restored. But it’s only 

effective if Trump understands that 

he now needs to compromise. He can’t 

shut down the government every time 

there’s a disagreement.

After the shutdown, is compromise possible?

Question: 

What goes 
great with your 
morning coffee?

Answer: 

michigandaily.com

Hong 
Kong 
is 
a 
cinematographer’s 
dream. 
Intoxicatingly 
busy 
and 
naturally beholden to beautiful 
landscapes, 
there’s 
always 
material to work with. It’s just 
the director’s job to pick out 
what to focus on. From classic 
Wong Kar Wai films to more 
recent Western ones, the city has 
always been a favored backdrop 
to moody, evocative stories. Why 
not try a murder mystery?
In the ITV show, “White 
Dragon,” (now hosted by Amazon 
Prime) 
British 
university 
professor Jonah Mulray (John 
Simm, “Life on Mars”) discovers 
his wife has been killed in a car 
accident halfway across the 
world in Hong Kong. He travels 
there to identify the body, but 
quickly figures out that his wife’s 
real life was more complicated 
than it seems. A businesswoman 
who split her time between 
London and Hong Kong, it seems 
her life was also split into two 
vastly different realms.
From then on, it’s a familiar 
story. Jonah, along with an 
(extremely) unlikely accomplice, 
tries to prove that his wife was 
actually 
murdered 
by 
some 
unsavory 
actors. 
The 
other 
mysterious figures that drop 
in and out of the narrative 
aren’t quite developed enough 

to make the mystery itself 
as intriguing as it should be. 
However, Simm and his Hong 
Kong-ese counterpart Anthony 
Wong 
(“Internal 
Affairs”), 
who 
plays 
a 
Hong 
Kong 
ex-cop named David Chen 
are solid performers, enough 
to make the show engaging. 
Both are cerebral, introverted 
yet 
emotional 
characters, 
convincingly 
distrusting 
of 
each other yet bound by Jonah’s 
wife’s biggest secret.
There’s also a backdrop of 
corruption within government 
and big business that complicate 
the case and perhaps play a big 
role in it itself. It isn’t quite 
explored enough in the early 
episodes, but there is always a 
danger of the various factions 
and storylines becoming too 
convoluted 
(which 
usually 
happens when the screenwriters 
get a bit too far up into their own 
… ). David’s daughter Lau (Katie 
Leung, “One Child”), a budding 
activist, is a convincing link 
between the family drama and 
the more grandiose aspects of 
the story. Leung’s performance 
accurately reflects the particular 
brand 
of 
bitterness 
that 
teenagers possess while avoiding 
the trap of overdoing the “bitter 
teenager” act.
As I mentioned before, it’s 
hard to mess up shooting in Hong 
Kong. To the cinematographers’ 
credit here, they don’t. While 
almost a cliché at this point, 

the neon extravaganzas and 
vistas the city contains are a 
perfect backdrop for a story 
of international intrigue and 
mystery. Jonah’s stature and 
plight feel appropriately small in 
the skyscraper maze, mirroring 
his 
desire 
to 
know 
what 
happened to his wife compared 
to the larger forces that appear 
to be at work.
“White Dragon” is probably 
compelling enough to grab your 
attention for the span of eight, 
relatively short episodes. But 
it treads on relatively well-
trodden ground, and does not 
contain any stand-out elements 
or performances that make it a 
must watch.

Things 
have 
quieted 
down a bit in Park City. 
The 
streets 
are 
not 
as 
crowded, a little less hectic. 
The hoards of Sundance-
goers 
have 
dwindled 
to 
a 
meager 
smattering 
of 
people. With the decline 
in the temporary influx of 
the town’s population, the 
screenings are less packed. 
The celebrity guests have 
made their appearances, and 
some have already traveled 
back to the warm cocoon 
of Hollywood, with a few 
critics trailing behind. The 
makeshift 
studios 
where 
entertainment publications 
hosted 
exclusive 
parties 
have been broken down and 
emptied out. The downtown 
area 
starts 
to 
slowly 
resemble 
a 
ghost 
town, 
but one that maintains an 
unusual calmness.
With only four days left, 
I’ve passed the midpoint 
of the festival. While the 
nonstop 
watching 
and 
writing 
about 
the 
films 
I see have exhausted my 
brain cells and made me 
a tad restless, I’ve grown 
comfortable 
with 
the 
screening routine. Enough 
time has passed where the 
procedure before for every 
screening has become pretty 
simple and standard. Outside 
the theater, I enter a white 
tent, open up my jacket and 
backpack for the security 
guards and ask one of the 
volunteers, 
all 
of 
whom 
are dressed in puffy purple 
Kenneth Cole jackets, to 
direct me to a waiting line.
Once inside, a volunteer 
scans my press pass and 
stamps my hand. Sitting 
in the middle of the most 
middle row is absolutely 
key for a prime viewing 
experience. If I miss lunch, 
I’ll grab a small popcorn 
and an apple — will my 
stomach ever forgive me 
for what I’ve done to it? 
Before the projector starts 
up, a volunteer makes a 
brief introduction of the 
film and its running time. 
The lights then dim. Some 
stragglers make their way 
to their seats. A recap of the 
previous day at the festival 
plays before launching into 
a rapid-fire slideshow set to 
a tribal drum beat of images 
and 
words 
that 
express 
the mission of Sundance: 
Experiment. 
Challenge. 
Question. Break.

‘Big 
Time 
Adolescence’:

Sundance loves coming-
of-age 
stories. 
From 
the 
critical 
and 
commercial 
smash 
of 
2006’s, 
“Little 
Miss 
Sunshine,” 
to 
the 
2015 Grand Jury Prize and 
Audience 
Award 
winner, 
“Me and Earl and the Dying 
Girl,” 
the 
festival 
can’t 
get enough of supporting 
movies that center around 
the awkward and endlessly 
relatable lives of teenagers. 
But 
how, 
then, 
does 
a 
coming-of-age film identify 
itself among the crowded 
slate of projects like it? With 
his hilarious and heartfelt 
Linklater-ian feature debut 
“Big 
Time 
Adolescence,” 
writer-director Jason Orley 
(“The Intern”) might have 
an idea.
While it may not be a total 
game-changer 
for 
youth-
oriented cinema, “Big Time 
Adolescence” benefits from 
the intoxicating charisma 
of its two leads and a strong 
script filled with punchy 
one-liners and smart, sharp 
dialogue. The film’s opening 
voiceover, narrated by the 
protagonist 
Mo 
(Griffin 
Gluck, “American Vandal”), 
admittedly doesn’t inspire 
much confidence, being that 
it’s a very common, overused 
device used in coming-of-
age films that prioritizes 

exposition 
over 
simply 
showing the action on its 
own (see: the 2013 Sundance 
favorite “The Spectacular 
Now”). Luckily, it’s the only 
time during the entire film 
where it occurs, dedicating 
the rest of the story to the 
kinetic relationship between 
Mo and his sister’s college 
dropout stoner ex-boyfriend 
Zeke (Pete Davidson, “Set It 
Up”).
The two have a friendship 
like any other: They grab 
burgers 
together, 
drive 
around town, shop for snacks 
and booze and talk about 
their romantic lives. The 
only difference is that Mo 
is still in high school, while 
Zeke 
is 
skating 
through 
his 20s with a carefree 
aimlessness. 
Mo 
prefers 
spending more time at Zeke’s 
bachelor pad than with kids 
his own age, a habit that irks 
Mo’s concerned dad Reuben 
(a 
wonderful 
Jon 
Cryer, 
“Two and a Half Men”). 
When Mo’s social climber 
classmate Stacey (Thomas 
Barbusca, 
“Searching”) 
propositions 
to 
start 
a 
drug-and-alcohol-dealing 
business at the popular high 
school senior parties, Mo 
asks Zeke, a former high 
school party king, for help. 
This 
situation 
leads 
the 
two friends on a hysterical 
journey 
of 
self-discovery 
and inevitably, a dramatic 
unraveling of sorts.
Though Griffin Gluck does 
a fantastic job, Pete Davidson 
is the real star of the show, 
delivering a career-defining 
performance for a role that 
was made for him. Exercising 
the 
witty, 
observational 
humor from his time as a 
cast member on “Saturday 
Night 
Live,” 
Davidson 
continues to justify why he’s 
one of the brightest and most 
entertaining 
comedians 
to grace the screen and 
the stage in a long while. 
With every setup to a joke, 
Davidson always manages 
to come prepared with a 
satisfying payoff, either in 
the form of a goofy facial 
expression or a snarky, gut-
busting quip.
It’s hard not to recognize 
the 
obvious 
parallels 
between 
Davidson’s 
character and his real-life 
persona — they both smoke 
weed on a daily basis and 
have 
a 
wickedly 
vulgar 
sense of humor. Even his 
Hillary 
Clinton 
tattoo 
and love for “Call Me By 
Your 
Name” 
wunderkind 
Timothée 
Chalamet 
are 
referenced 
at 
one 
point. 
But what’s most fascinating 
about this blurring of worlds 
is how Davidson’s heavily 
publicized 
image 
almost 
color 
in 
the 
existential 
conflicts 
Zeke 
faces. 
He 
brings a pathos to Zeke’s lack 
of ambition that twists the 
lonely stoner archetype into 
something more melancholic 
and meditative. Zeke isn’t 
just drifting through the 
abyss of young adulthood, 
but 
rather 
navigating 
through the sadness of being 
unable to escape the days of 
high school, when life was 
simpler, 
responsibilities 
were less serious and the 
future less daunting.
Though 
Gluck 
and 
Davidson carry the story 
quite nicely and effectively, 
there are a few faults in 
“Big 
Time 
Adolescence” 
that prevent it from being a 
truly remarkable film. These 
flaws rest mostly with the 
main 
female 
characters, 
Mo’s love interest, Sophie 
(Oona 
Laurence, 
“The 
Beguiled”), 
and 
Zeke’s 
girlfriend, 
Holly 
(Sydney 
Sweeney, “Under the Silver 
Lake”). Both actresses do 
their best in squeezing some 
dimension out of their half-
baked 
roles, 
but 
Holly’s 
relegation to a sexualized 
spectacle 
and 
Sophie’s 
use of sarcasm as a way of 
flirting feel a little old-hat 
and overdone. Considering 

the surprising number of 
female-led 
coming-of-age 
films at this year’s Sundance, 
it’s a bummer that “Big Time 
Adolescence” 
can’t 
seem 
to match the complexity of 
its male characters with its 
female characters.
Still, these imperfections 
aren’t as glaring as they seem. 
Zeke and Mo don’t always 
get away with the dumb 
hijinks they find themselves 
in, 
which 
sometimes 
involve 
both 
Holly 
and 
Sophie. By facing up to 
the consequences of their 
actions, Zeke and Mo learn 
that their unconventional 
friendship can only last for 
so long before it collapses 
onto itself. In the end, “Big 
Time Adolescence” comes 
out victorious as a loose 
yet sturdy hangout comedy 
that spins some thoughtful, 
clever 
commentary 
on 
the absurd highs and life-
altering lows of adolescence.

‘Sweetheart’:

Survival movies are bent 
on one end goal: seeking 
a way back to the world 
from which we came. After 
being marooned far away 
from civilization, the main 
character 
of 
a 
survival 
movie — usually the only 
character in the story, unless 
you’re counting flashbacks 
or hallucinations of their 
loved ones — is forced to 
fight their way through the 
dangerous unpredictability 
of nature, either by sea 
(“Life of Pi,” “Adrift”) or by 
land (“Cast Away,” “Lost”). 
J.D. 
Dillard’s 
small 
but 
terrifying creature feature 
“Sweetheart” explores both 
scenarios, but differentiates 
itself from other survival 
narratives by examining the 
real malevolent forces that 
bring unwanted terror to 
our daily lives.
Beginning 
in 
the 
unknown 
depths 
of 
the 
ocean, “Sweetheart” opens 
on Jenn (a ferocious Kiersey 
Clemons, 
“Hearts 
Beat 
Loud”), 
a 
young 
woman 
washed ashore on a deserted 
island after what seemed 
like a shipwreck. She’s quick 
to see that no one else is 
there, with the exception 
of her two friends — one on 
the verge of death, the other 
already dead. The horror 
doesn’t stop there. After 
discovering 
a 
few 
items 
left 
behind 
by 
previous 
survivors, 
Jenn 
begins 
to 
trace 
the 
mysterious 
source responsible for their 
disappearance. In what is 
quite possibly one of the 
most magnificent antagonist 
reveals I’ve seen in a thriller, 
she realizes the cause comes 
from 
a 
menacing 
water 
monster that feasts on its 
prey at night.
As 
Jenn 
scrambles 
to 
protect 
herself 
while 
finding a way off the island, 
“Sweetheart” deepens into 
a stomach-churning slow-
burn. The film’s constant 
switching 
between 
day 
and night is a classic yet 
somehow perfect way to 
build 
suspense, 
involving 
us 
in 
Jenn’s 
agony 
and 
helplessness but giving us 
enough room to breathe in 
between. Clemons’s fierce 
physical performance also 
anchors the nearly silent 
first act from drowning into 
a total bore. Known for more 
light-hearted comedies like 
“Dope” and “Neighbors 2: 
Sorority Rising,” Clemons 
and her remarkable ability 
to 
swing 
from 
terrified 
and trapped to defiant and 
robust proves that she’s no 
one trick pony. At a certain 
point, though, it’s hard to 
tell where “Sweetheart” is 
going and what point it’s 
trying to make that hasn’t 
already been expressed in 
other films of the ilk.

At this point I’m convinced 
that everyone who took French 
in high school knows the lyrics 
to a Stromae song by heart. 
Maybe I’m way off the mark, but 
my anecdotal evidence suggests 
that “Papaoutai” and “Tous 
Les Mêmes” are universally 
known and beloved. Whether 
or not that’s true, Belgian 
artist Stromae’s 2013 album 
Racine Carrée (Square Root) 
is a great choice for budding 
Francophones.
Stromae 
had 
already 
broken through the world of 
Francophone music and even 
internationally 
by 
the 
time 
Racine Carrée was released. His 
2009 song “Alors on Danse,” 
(“So We Dance”), a nihilistic 
dance anthem (that was way 
ahead of its time in terms of 
subject matter) reached the 
top of several European charts 
and was eventually remixed by 
Kanye West.
Racine Carrée contains more 
of the formula that made “Alors 
on Danse” so powerful. It’s 
filled with disillusionment and 
disappointment 
with 
family, 
relationships and technology. 
It’s fundamentally cynical. Yet 
the musical influences that 
Stromae channels and combines 
are playful and sugary as (name 
your European continental pop 

group here).
“Papaoutai,” 
the 
album’s 
biggest hit, is an emotional plea 
to his father, who died in the 
Rwandan Genocide early in his 
son’s life. The track starts out 
with a tone of resignation before 
transitioning to one of frenetic, 
desperate anger. Stromae snarls, 

“Tout le monde sait comment on 
fait les bébés/ Mais personne 
sait comment on fait des papas” 
(“Everyone knows how to make 
babies/ but no one knows how to 
make papas”). The track is built 
on a layer of piano rolls you 
would expect to hear in a house 
track in a Brussels nightclub 
and rhythms influenced by the 
African music that Stromae 
mentions he grew up on.
In an interview with The 
Guardian, 
Stromae 
states, 
“Hip hop, pop, dance – the 

common point is melancholy. 
That’s international, and I like 
this word because it’s not only 
about sadness or happiness – 
it’s both at the same time. And 
that’s human and that’s life.” 
Stromae’s best work on Racine 
Carrée embodies this to a T. I’m 
reminded of one of the biggest 
hits of the century so far: “Hey 
Ya” by Outkast, in which André 
3000 
chides 
his 
audience, 
“Y’all don’t want to hear me, 
you just want to dance.” “Hey 
Ya” is also fundamentally a 
song 
about 
disillusionment 
and 
relationships. 
It 
just 
also happens to be one of the 
catchiest songs ever made.
However, I don’t think that 
Stromae wants to chide us for 
enjoying his work at all. The 
experiences 
he 
details 
are 
extremely personal and might 
not apply to everyone, but 
the emotions themselves are 
universal. In the music video for 
“Formidable” (“Wonderful”), he 
stumbles drunkenly around the 
streets of Brussels, airing out 
his regrets and heartbreak over 
a recently ended relationship. 
The autotune on his voice makes 
him end up resembling the voice 
and spirit of his countryman 
Jacques Brel in the tear-jerking 
“Ne Me Quitte Pas” (“Do not 
leave me”) with all its throaty, 
rolled “r”s. Everyone’s been 
there before. What’s a better 
way to become closer than to 
sing and dance about it.

On the power of Stromae & 
his fundamental cynicism

DAILY WORLD MUSIC COLUMN

The 
last 
few 
days 
of 
Sundance 
are 
an 
overwhelming, 
delirious 
mix 
of 
exhilaration 
and 
exhaustion. 
In 
between 
attending the final screenings 
of the festival and being holed 
up in a coffee shop writing 
reviews for hours, I spent my 
remaining time in Park City 
at a wonderfully animated 
panel with Desiree Akhavan, 
the winner of last year’s 
Grand Jury Prize for “The 
Miseducation 
of 
Cameron 
Post,” and Nisha Ganatra, the 
director of the Mindy Kaling-
penned comedy “Late Night.” 
The 
conversation 
between 
Akhavan 
and 
Ganatra 
was better than I could’ve 
expected. Along with going 
off on hilarious tangents and 
spilling tea on people they’ve 
worked 
with, 
they 
each 
discussed their backgrounds 
studying film at NYU Tisch, 
directing TV and movies, how 
they’ve grown as artists from 
their previous projects and 
the challenges of making low-
budget productions.
Although meeting Akhavan 
and Ganatra after the panel 
was one of the many great 
moments during the festival, 
my packed showing of “Honey 
Boy” was just as unforgettable. 
The star of the show Noah 
Jupe and the director Alma 
Ha’rel 
(“Bombay 
Beach”) 
were in attendance as were 
other 
famous 
folks 
like 
Kiersey 
Clemons 
(“Hearts 
Beat Loud”), Tessa Thompson 
(“Thor: Ragnarok”), Damien 
Chazelle (“First Man”) and 
Millicent Simmonds (“A Quiet 
Place”). 
During 
the 
post-
screening Q&A, out stepped 
“Honey Boy” writer and actor 
Shia Labeouf, and naturally, 
the crowd greeted him with 
rapturous applause.
Equipped with a green 
ushanka, Labeouf entertained 
the 
audience 
with 
his 
lovable weirdo personality, 
unspooling a series of stream-
of-consciousness 
reflections 
with a disarming gentleness 
about 
working 
through 
his demons while making 
“Honey Boy.” As the Q&A 
grew more emotional, Jupe 
leaned his head on Ha’rel’s 
shoulder, a loving sight to 
behold, while she discussed 
her own experiences with 
having an alcoholic father. 
One 
might 
think 
there’s 
an 
air 
of 
manipulative, 
uncomfortable performativity 
with sentimental moments 
like these, but judging from 
the film itself, which you’ll 
read my thoughts about below, 
nothing felt more authentic.
My final, sold-out screening 
of the festival, “Late Night,” 
was similarly ecstatic, despite 
no celebrities in attendance. 
Though the comedy itself was 
a tad underwhelming, the 
audience’s engaged reactions 
— lots of laughing, especially 
during one early scene when 
Mindy Kaling’s character gets 
hit with a bag of garbage — 
made the whole experience 

worthwhile.

‘Honey Boy’:

Writing about the past 
traumas 
that 
continue 
to 
haunt us is perhaps the best 
and most accessible way to 
overcome them. But trying 
to 
perform 
our 
traumas? 
That’s a whole other kind of 
transcendent catharsis. This 
is the heady goal actor-writer-
provocateur 
Shia 
Labeouf 
(“Nymphomaniac”) attempts 
to achieve — exceptionally so, 
if I might add — in the script 
for his trippy, brilliant meta 
memoir “Honey Boy.” Directed 
with sharp sensitivity by Alma 
Ha’rel 
(“Bombay 
Beach”), 
“Honey Boy” operates as both 
a harrowing tale of child abuse 
and PTSD and a psychological 
and emotional deep dive into 
Labeouf’s psyche.
Like 
a 
buried, 
bruised 
memory come to life, “Honey 
Boy” is as unabashedly raw in 
its depiction of troublesome 
father-son dynamics as it 
is vibrant in its fantastic 
performances. Some might 
find it difficult to watch 
the 
physical 
mistreatment 
Labeouf endured as a child, 
but almost everyone can relate 
to the feeling of immense 
pressure our parents put on 
us to fulfill the grand ideal 
life that they never had the 
opportunity to live through 
themselves. That feeling is no 
more actualized than in the 
title of the film itself, which 
stems 
from 
an 
endearing 
nickname 
Labeouf’s 
father 
gave 
him 
while 
raising 
Labeouf in a Hollywood motel 
to support his burgeoning 
career as a young TV star 
on Disney Channel’s “Even 
Stevens.”
Blending 
fiction 
and 
reality, “Honey Boy” cements 
Labeouf’s relationship with 
his father as the foundation 
of its premise, but projects 
it through characters with 
different 
names. 
Standing 
in for Shia’s persona is Otis 
Lort (played by both Noah 
Jupe, “Suburbicon” and Lucas 
Hedges, 
“Boy 
Erased”), 
a 
successful young actor who 
uses his craft to channel 
his creative spirit and mask 
the loneliness of his dismal 
environment at home. And 
standing in for Shia’s father 
is James Lort (played with 
magnificence 
by 
Labeouf 
himself), 
a 
recovering 
alcoholic rodeo clown who 
simultaneously praises and 
envies his son’s newfound 
fame.
The inner turmoil wrestling 
inside Shia — oops, I mean 
Otis — is distilled beautifully 
in 
the 
film’s 
phenomenal 
long-take opener, where an 
older Otis, strapped into a 
harness, is thrust backward 
during an explosion stunt 
on what looks like a set of a 
“Transformers” 
sequel. 
It 
becomes immediately clear 
what 
Labeouf 
and 
Ha’rel 
(and Hedges, for that matter) 
are trying to convey in this 
one scene: You can’t escape 
the pain of the past and its 
overwhelming 
pull. 
After 

running into the law over 
drunken misconduct, Otis is 
sent to rehab and encouraged 
by his therapist (Laura San 
Giacomo, 
“Sex, 
Lies 
and 
Videotape”) to revisit his 
childhood and explore his 
suppressed anger. From there, 
the film shifts back and forth 
between two time periods 
in Otis’s life: the older Otis 
struggles with deep-seated, 
unaddressed 
frustrations 
while 
the 
younger 
Otis 
grapples 
with 
quiet 
resentment toward his father.
Within 
its 
therapeutic 
narrative, 
“Honey 
Boy” 
injects these two concurrent 
storylines with a compelling 
amount of tenderness and 
vulnerability 
provided 
by 
the main cast. In the limited 
screen 
time 
he’s 
given, 
Hedges, reliably mesmerizing 
as 
ever, 
elevates 
his 
character’s blunt mannerisms 
and unhinged personality into 
more than just a solid Shia 
Labeouf caricature. Labeouf 
is 
transfixing 
as 
James, 
latching onto the empathetic 
nerve of his father’s own 
internal 
troubles 
with 
a 
surprising amount of depth. 
It takes so much courage 
to portray the person who 
basically is the cause of all of 
your anguish. But of the three, 
Jupe shines the most. The 
up-and-coming British actor 
delivers a marvelously mature 
and 
soulful 
performance, 
taking challenging material 
and executing it as if he’s been 
in the business for decades. 
Along with his turn in “A Quiet 
Place,” Jupe has secured his 
status as a star in the making 
with “Honey Boy.”
Though the performances 
alone are enthralling, “Honey 
Boy” is definitely not without 
its flaws. There’s a sweet albeit 
lazy 
and 
inconsequential 
subplot involving a sex worker 
named Little Q (enigmatic 
musician FKA Twigs in her 
feature debut), who acts as 
a sort of surrogate mother 
character for young Otis. Even 
though her brief friendship 
with Otis is touching in parts, 
the lack of substance brought 
to her character and their 
dynamic as a whole wears 
down the infectiously scrappy 
pacing of “Honey Boy.” The 
same goes for Tom (Clifton 
Collins Jr., “The Mule”), a 
man hired by an agency to 
accompany Otis on social 
excursions 
when 
James 
proves 
to 
be 
unavailable. 
While his character is given 
much more emotional weight 
than Q’s, Tom’s presence in 
the film doesn’t make much of 
a lasting impression.
With that said, “Honey Boy” 
is an exemplary Capital-D 
Drama whose intense impact 
will linger long after the 
credits roll. Consider this Shia 
Labeouf’s magical return to 
the spotlight, as we finally get 
to understand the fragmented, 
complex mind behind the 
chaotic, 
much-publicized 
image we’re so used to seeing.

Fest: The final few flicks

SAYAN GHOSH
Daily World Music Columnist

Hot off their performance 
at the 42nd annual Ann Arbor 
Folk Festival hosted by local 
NGO and music club, The Ark, 
The RFD Boys lost no steam 
with 
another 
fantastic 
live 
performance.
Between The Ark’s intimate 
concert space and The RFD 
Boys’s 
laid-back, 
authentic 
country vibe, I felt more like 
I was sitting in a casual bar in 
southern West Virginia than 
a respectable music club in 
downtown Ann Arbor. Most 
of that is due to the band’s 
personal brand of magic; with 
both the nature of their music 
and their easy rapport with the 
audience in between songs, The 
RFD Boys almost completely 
eliminate 
any 
perceived 
distance between themselves 
and the audience. Complete 
with a red mailbox leaning 
awkwardly off to the side of the 
stage inviting patrons to submit 
their 
requests, 
the 
entire 
experience was comfortable, 
easy and warm.
The band took a quick stroll 
down memory lane, opening up 

the first half of their set with 
“Leavin’ the Ozarks,” a song 
they fondly remarked was one of 
their first ever written. Between 
songs, the band took some time 
to reminisce, having come up 
on an impressive milestone: 
The group has 50 years of 
performance under their belt, 
with no intentions of slowing 
down anytime soon. “Leavin’ 
the Ozarks” remembered the 
familiar yearning to break free 
and find your own path, as the 
band sang “every mile I travel 
is a mile from our past.” The 
song took on an interesting 
double meaning as The RFD 
Boys played on their home turf 
at this long-awaited milestone 
while singing, leaving the past 
behind.
“Blues Stay Away From Me,” 
“She’s Gone, Gone, Gone” and 
“The Train That Carried My 
Girl From Town” were the 
perfect blend of soulful blues 
and foot-stomping folk to warm 
up with on a blisteringly cold 
Friday night. “The Train That 
Carried My Girl From Town” 
in 
particular 
highlighted 
the 
skills 
of 
new 
addition 
Dan Roehrig on guitar (and 
occasionally 
on 
mandolin). 
Then, the banjo and fiddle took 

up a duet in “Turkey in the 
Straw,” 
showcasing 
(another 
newbie) David Mosher’s jaw-
dropping fiddle playing skills. 
Mosher took a turn on lead 
vocals with his rendition of a 
country classic, “She’s Gone, 
Gone, Gone,” while Roehrig’s 
own heartfelt singing got some 
much-appreciated spotlight in 
“The Train That Carried My 
Girl From Town.” As a girl with 
some country roots herself in 
West Virginia, The RFD Boys’ 
cover of Johnny Cash’s “Sea of 
Heartbreak” was perhaps the 
highlight of the night.
The 
RFD 
Boys 
are 
an 
underrated gem hidden away 
in the Midwest. Combining 
old-style, 
traditional 
blues 
and 
country 
while 
maintaining a fresh edge to 
every performance, the band 
capitalized on the electricity 
live 
performance 
lends 
to 
the rootsy energy of folk and 
blues. And while most of the 
audience were of Ann Arbor’s 
older crowd, the RFD Boys 
maintain their relevance with 
their dedication to their craft. 
And for anyone who considers 
themselves a folk and country 
fan, The RFD Boys, above all, 
feel like “home.”

Spending a night with The 
RFD Boys, who aren’t going 
to slow down any time soon

AUSTIN DAVIS’ JOURNEY FROM ONSTED TO ANN ARBOR

DETROIT — This time two 
years ago, then-freshman forward 
Will Lockwood was still recovering 
from a disclocated shoulder when 
he won his first “Duel in the D” 
with the Michigan hockey team. 
While he notched one assist in that 
game, it was clear that he wasn’t 
back to the level he was before the 
injury. 
This time last year, a shoulder 
injury at the World Juniors tour-
nament ended Lockwood’s season 
in January, just as he was getting 
back into a rhythm. He was forced 
to watch from the stands as his 
team kicked off an eight-game win 
streak that catapulted the Wolver-
ines to the Big Ten Tournament 
semifinals and eventually the Fro-
zen Four.
Two injuries 
to the same 
shoulder 
i
n 

t w o 
differ-
ent seasons 
cut both of 
those campaigns 
short. 
Now, Lockwood is doing 
everything he can to lead Michigan 
back to where it was last year. This 
time, he’s not watching it happen 
from the stands.
“It was tough, definitely,” Lock-
wood said Oct. 17 of not playing in 
the Frozen Four. “I mean, you ask 
any guy, it’s gonna be tough to be in 
the stands and not to be on the ice 
with your team.”
This weekend, Lockwood tal-
lied two goals and two assists in a 
series sweep over Michigan State. 
For the third time in his career, the 
Wolverines hoisted the ‘Iron D’ 
trophy after a 5-2 win on Saturday. 
But this time, he was a full partici-
pant in the victory.

“He had a couple of good looks 
tonight, so good for him,” said 
Michigan coach Mel Pearson on 
Saturday. “He’s a really good hock-
ey player and I’m glad for him. I’m 
happy for him that after all he’s 
been through the first couple years 
and not being able to play in the 
Frozen Four last year that he’s re-
ally playing well for us.”
In Friday night’s 5-3 win over 
the Spartans, Lockwood scored his 
sixth goal in seven games and add-
ed two assists for his second-high-
est point total in a single game this 
season. In addition to those points, 
he tested Michigan State goalten-
der Drew DeRidder with quite a 
few ‘Grade-A’ scoring chances.
And on Saturday, he added an-
other goal to his weekend total and 
again created chances nearly every 
time he was on the ice.
“He’s our most dynamic player 
up front by far,” Pearson said Fri-
day night. “He’s having his best 
year. You can see it. You can see the 
speed, you can see the quickness, 
you can see the creativity. 
He’s playing hard 
and he’s an 

e x -
citing play-
er.”
Lockwood’s ability to be 
dynamic and create scoring chanc-
es has played a large role in his 
recent success, but his willingness 
to get to what to Pearson calls the 
“gritty area” of the ice is even more 
important.
Both goals this weekend came 
on tip-ins in front of the net as he 
was battling for position. Friday, 
freshman defenseman Jack Sum-
mers fired a slapshot from the left 
point that Lockwood got a stick 
on to redirect into the net. It was 
a heads-up, skilled play — exactly 
what Pearson wants to see in that 
area of the ice.
Saturday night, another shot 
found Lockwood just in front of 
DeRidder. This time, it came from 
sophomore defenseman Quinn 

Hughes while the Wolverines were 
on the power play. Junior forward 
Nick Pastujov tried to shoot the 
puck himself, but Lockwood col-
lected it and sent the puck between 
Pastujov’s legs and past DeRidder.
Just as Pearson always preaches, 
getting to the “gritty area” resulted 
in rewards for his team. And he es-
pecially likes to see that grittiness 
from Lockwood now that he’s fully 
healthy and back in form.
“This year, he came back from 
the shoulder, took him a while 
to get going and now he’s going,” 
Pearson said. “Once the puck starts 
going in the net, then your con-
fidence just takes off. He’s going 
to hard ice. He’s just not coming 
down and making fancy plays 
but he’s getting to that hard 
ice and rebounds, tip-ins.”
Pearson’s system is 
predicated on get-
ting pucks to 
the net 

and 
hav-
ing players in that 
hard ice in front of the goal-
tender to clean up rebounds and 
create scoring opportunities.
And Lockwood’s willingness to 
work in that hard area of the ice 
has paid off.
“
Just getting to the net has been 
something that I’ve been focus-
ing on,” Lockwood said Saturday. 
“We’ve got a lot of good players on 
the ice and they’re doing a great job 
with the puck and getting it to the 
net. Just being opportunistic these 
past couple of games.”
Fighting for pucks in front of the 
net isn’t the flashiest way to play. 
Forwards tend to want to create 
dazzling plays up the center of the 
ice or score from the wing to show 
off the strength of their shot.
But it works, and Lockwood 
— fully healthy down the stretch 
for the first time at Michigan — is 
reaping the benefits.

T

he village of Onsted does 
not have a lot. 
It doesn’t have more 
than 1,000 residents, and it 
doesn’t have a Meijer (or a 
Walmart, or a Whole Foods, or 
probably any 
store where 
most people 
would choose 
to go grocery 
shopping). 
It most defi-
nitely does not 
have its own 
exit on the 
highway, or 
really even an 
exit near it at all, and just is not 
a convenient drive unless you’re 
taking US-12.
But Onsted does have a stop-
light, and John Beilein knows all 
about it.
“I grew up in farmlands. You 
go in (to Onsted) and there’s 
probably one stoplight — now, it’s 
a blinking light I think in Onst-
ed… I don’t even know if we had 
a light,” Beilein told The Daily. 
“We might have had one light in 
my hometown, too.”
As someone who comes from 
a place that has two whole stop-
lights, I want to stress how a 
small number of stoplights in a 
town can build character. And 
Onsted, with its one blinking 
stoplight, has followed suit, as 
the historical little village about 
an hour away from Ann Arbor is 
where Austin Davis calls home.
A redshirt junior for the 
Michigan men’s basketball team, 
Davis is only the 14th player 
from Lenawee County — not just 
Onsted, but the entire county 
— to play Division I basketball. 
He was carried to Michigan by a 
standout career built in Onsted, 
the same place where he used to 
go “downtown” to get a haircut 
in a barbershop while listening 
to old-timers talk and where his 
mom, Marsha, is the principal of 
an elementary school.
With these traits in mind, you 
can imagine the crisp contrast 
that separates Onsted High 

School from the University of 
Michigan or even the village of 
Onsted from Ann Arbor. The 
social difference is stark; the 
physical difference is actually 
laughable.
“That was really 
quite the shock 
when I came here, 
just the amount of 
people and how 
different it just 
was,” Davis said. 
“But I always real-
ly loved (Onsted), 
everybody always 
knew what was 
going on. If you 
had a good team, 
it didn’t matter what sport it was, 
men’s sports, women’s sports, 
didn’t matter.
“… But, honestly, living in the 
city — and this might sound stu-
pid — it’s not seeing the woods. 
Growing up at our house in 
Onsted, we have like three acres 
but it’s right on the edge of a huge 
forest. We have big crop fields 
and agriculture fields surround-
ing us. You see deer, turkeys, all 
kinds of wildlife all the time. It’s 
just a shock, going from that.”
It’s true. North Campus’ one 
trail through the woods near 
the School of Music, Theatre & 
Dance and Nichols Arb, though 
both very nicely kept and won-
derful walks in the fall, is nothing 
compared to the cornfields and 
dense woods that dominate parts 
of Michigan. 
Of course, Davis made the 
adjustment to deal with these 
differences. He leaned on his 
teammates, and he’s dealing with 
the change in scenery (for now). 
Coming from a Class B school 
with a graduating class of 86 
people makes these adjustments 
hard enough, but adapting to the 
academic end of that can be even 
harder. 
Some smaller public schools 
in the state of Michigan don’t 
offer a wide variety of classes, or 
AP classes at all. My high school, 
which played Onsted in multiple 
sports, didn’t offer any math 

classes beyond Algebra II unless 
you count physics or consumer’s 
math, which is where we learned 
how to do our taxes (which is 
arguably more important than 
the Pythago-
rean theory — 
theorem? — but 
definitely not 
a good enough 
prep course for 
the hell that 
is Michigan 
Math). 
But, luckily 
for Davis, Onst-
ed’s lone blink-
ing stoplight 
prepped him for 
that adjustment, too. 
“We had a few AP classes. 
We actually had a really good 
math teacher, his name was Mr. 
Gemalsky. I took every class 
he offered. I just really enjoyed 
going to class and learning from 

him and we had a lot of teachers 
like that. That didn’t necessarily 
go to places like Michigan, but 
really tried to push people to be 
their best.
“We definitely 
were lucky to have 
that. I know a lot 
of the really small 
schools didn’t have 
stuff like that, so 
we were lucky and 
fortunate to have 
that.”
Beilein and 
Davis were both 
aware of the jump 
he would have to 
make. They knew 
it would take an adjustment, 
going from a village to a Division 
I school. They knew it back in his 
junior year of high school.
They went with it anyway.
“If he’s got the passion and 
he wants to come here, it’s a no 

brainer,” Beilein said. “He’s a 
brilliant high school student, 
he really fit, I felt, and he really 
dedicated himself… And so when 
we offered him the scholarship, 
it was with the 
idea that he 
would redshirt 
for a year. And 
that’s how it 
all happened 
because he basi-
cally told me at 
the time, ‘Coach, 
if you ever offer 
me a scholarship 
to the University 
of Michigan, I’m 
coming.’”
And he did. Four years later, 
Davis, a star basketball kid from a 
little village in Michigan, is a red-
shirt junior who has two years of 
eligibility left. He’s majoring in 
movement science, and he wants 
to be a physical therapist one day 

— maybe in a town with a little 
more greenery than Ann Arbor 
and fewer people. 
He mostly finds himself at his 
hometown for his little sister’s 
volleyball games in the fall, or his 
little brother’s basketball games 
in the winter. When he goes, he 
talks to to his old coach and fam-
ily, and to those same old-timers 
he chatted up in the barbershop 
where he used to get his hair cut.
He’s a local celebrity. He’s six-
foot-10, so there’s no doubt he’s 
a little hard to ignore. But it’s 
mostly because he made history 
for a random town southwest of 
Ann Arbor.
Not bad for someone who 
comes from a little village with 
one blinking stoplight.

SportsMonday Column: One blinking stoplight

Just another Michigan-Wisconsin duel
E

than Happ grabbed 
the collar of his jersey, 
brought it to his face and 
clenched it with his teeth. His 
head slumped, his hands covered 
his neck as he shuffled to the end 
of the Wis-
consin hand-
shake line.
John 
Beilein 
approached 
Happ, and 
the two 
embraced 
as good 
sportspeople 
do. But 
while Happ’s 
frustration was obvious, for 
the Michigan men’s basketball 
coach, it was an embrace of 
relief.
“Ethan Happ said to me after 
the game, I hope to see you again 
this season. No, Ethan, I don’t 
want to see you again the rest of 
my life,” Beilein recalled after 
his team dispatched Happ’s Bad-
gers, 61-52, on Saturday. “This 
guy was absolutely incredible.”
Beilein, by nature, never has 
anything but positive things 
to say about upcoming foes, no 
matter their caliber. But the 
praises he offered Wisconsin on 
Friday afternoon ran far deeper 
than the typical platitudes about 
playing hard and having experi-
ence.
“Wisconsin, right now, is 
playing as good 
as anybody in the 
country. They 
could beat any-
body in the coun-
try. Quote me 
on that,” Beilein 
said. “ … The 
names are differ-
ent, it’s the exact 
same (as the) 
teams that were 
winning champi-
onships over and over again.
“Look at their stats and our 
stats overall and we’re doing the 
same thing. They might foul a 
little bit more than us, but we 
don’t go to the foul line a lot. 
Everything’s almost virtually 
the same, the lines are. It’s called 
winning basketball. You don’t 
turn it over, you make your foul 

shots, you don’t foul people, you 
don’t give up threes. It’s winning 
basketball.”
Wisconsin basketball is as 
much an institution as the 
university itself. The champi-
onship-winning Badger teams 
of yesteryear slowed the game 
down to a crawl, played dis-
ciplined defense, ran efficient 
offense predicated on outside 
shooting and often revolved 
around a transcendent superstar.
This year’s outfit is no dif-
ferent. In the past, Sam Dekker, 
Nigel Hayes and Josh Gasser 
orbited around Frank Kaminsky 
with Bo Ryan roaming the side-
line. Now, it’s Happ in the mid-
dle of it all, scoring points and 
pinging passes to Brad Davison, 
Nate Reuvers and D’Mitrik Trice 
while Greg Gard looks on.
It was winning basketball 
then, and it still is now. Wiscon-
sin handed Michigan its first loss 
on Jan. 19, in a game that was 
close all the way through, until 
the Badgers finally ground the 
Wolverines into a fine powder 
down the stretch. Michigan ran 
into an immovable object that 
day — a team with an identity 
that refused to change for any 
opponent, no matter if that 
opponent was 17-0.
“People don’t lose here 
because it’s the Kohl Center,” 
Beilein said then. “They lose 
here because of the style of play 
that Wisconsin plays. They don’t 
beat themselves, 
and they’re just 
tough to play. … 
We say, ‘We don’t 
want to play 
Wisconsin, cause 
they’re so good.”
Beilein was 
just 5-17 in his 
career against 
the Badgers 
entering Satur-
day. But his relief 
after the game didn’t just come 
from getting his sixth. It also 
seemed to come from doing so 
against the Wolverines’ mirror 
image.
Beilein’s compliments for 
Wisconsin on Friday match 
the team, program and iden-
tity he’s spent the last 12 years 
cultivating in Ann Arbor. What 

Michigan takes pride in — mis-
take-free offense and smart but 
hard-nosed defense — are the 
same things the Badgers value.
It makes sense, then, that 
Saturday’s rematch was so 
similar to the teams’ meeting in 
Madison. Baskets were difficult 
to come by. The pace was slow — 
almost torturously so at times. 
For most of the second half, the 
margin never crept above five 
points.
In short, it looked like a Mich-
igan-Wisconsin basketball game.
“We hit big shots down the 
stretch and they didn’t last time, 
and it kind of flipped around,” 
Davison said. “They’re a very 
good team, very well-coached 
and play very well defensively. 
So it’s kind of just two jugger-
nauts going at it.”
Except for the result, the 
Wolverines barely changed 
anything from the first meeting. 
Happ, who averages 18 points 
per game, almost demands to 
be double-teamed in the low 
post. But that’s just not what 
Michigan does. Junior center 
Jon Teske played Happ straight 

up, and after a hot start, going 
7-for-10 with 14 points in the 
first half, he hit just two shots 
the rest of the way, saddled with 
foul trouble.
“They really just gave him 
one-on-one and let him go at 
Teske,” Davison said. “(Junior 
guard Zavier) Simpson’s obvi-
ously very good 
at raiding and 
digging and they 
would do that 
every once in a 
while, but they 
pretty much let 
him go one-on-
one.”
Depending on 
who the Badgers 
had on the court, 
the Wolverines 
sent the occasional double. 
But for most of the game, they 
allowed Happ to get his, and if 
he did, so be it. They refused 
to allow Wisconsin’s shooters 
open looks out of the double-
team. The Badgers hit just four 
3-pointers.
Happ isn’t just his graceful 
footwork or silky touch on his 

hook shot, though — his drib-
bling and passing ability put 
him in his own league among 
big men. But by single-teaming 
Happ, Michigan took his play-
making out of the equation: he 
had one assist against five turn-
overs dealing with Teske’s size 
and Simpson’s pressure.
“If he catches 
it in the post, 
it’s very easy 
for him to score 
there,” Teske 
said. “You gotta 
push, deny him 
outside and 
just try to make 
him dribble and 
he’s gonna keep 
coming at you, 
keep coming at 
you, he’s gonna dribble, dribble, 
dribble. So you just gotta play 
him, wall him up. He’s gonna 
spin baseline, he’s gonna get his 
hooks, he’s gonna score a few.”
Michigan’s defense of Happ 
was just a microcosm of its plan 
to defeat Wisconsin. The Wol-
verines ensured the game would 
be played on their terms, the 

opposite of the first matchup. 
They made one of the most 
unique players in college basket-
ball one-dimensional — at least 
as one-dimensional as possible.
And they caused Happ to 
stand in the Crisler Center tun-
nel, speaking to reporters and 
rueing opportunities he failed to 
take advantage of.
“It was kinda what I expected, 
which was Teske one-on-one, 
and then a lot of digging and 
helping,” Happ said. “Teske did a 
nice job chesting up, but again, I 
just felt like there was more that 
I left out on the table that I wish 
I could get back.”
But Happ’s body language 
after his final, meaningless 
heave smacked off the backboard 
was perhaps more telling.
It was a look of multifaceted 
frustration: from missed chanc-
es, yes, but from losing in such a 
fashion to a team so reminiscent 
of his — but on this day, simply 
better.

Wisconsin forward Ethan Happ was frustrated after Michigan beat Wisconsin, 61-52, avenging a loss three weeks ago by playing a style similar to the Badgers.

I just felt like 
there was more 
that I left out on

Wisconsin, 
right now, is 
playing as good

Redshirt sophomore forward Austin Davis grew up in Onsted, a small town in southeastern Michigan, before coming to Ann Arbor to play for the Wolverines.

It really was

He really fit,

Charles Matthews makes the difference for ‘M’

Three weeks ago in Madison, 
Michigan’s undefeated season 
lay in the balance of a one-point 
game with seven minutes to 
play. That time, the Wolverines’ 
offense wilted, scoring just 10 
points over the remainder of 
the gane and falling, 64-54, at 
the hands of the Badgers.
So on Saturday afternoon 
against the same opponent, 
when Michigan was faced with 
a near-identical situation up 
one with 7:13 to go, the question 
became how it would avoid a 
repeat of the final score. But 
just as soon as the predicament 
had manifested itself, Charles 
Matthews — one of the biggest 
culprits in the Wolverines’ 
loss last month with three 
turnovers, two fouls and just 
two field goals in the second 
half — provided a solution.
Midway through the second 
half, 
Wisconsin’s 
offense 
started clicking for the first 
time all afternoon, demanding 
that someone on Michigan 
answer the call — a situation 
that would normally call for 
sophomore guard Jordan Poole 
or freshman forward Ignas 
Brazdeikis 
to 
take over.
But as those 
two 
combined 
to go 5-for-20 
from the field, 
Matthews 
put 
the 
kind 
of 
stamp 
on 
the 
game that, for 
him, has been 
restricted 
to 
the 
defensive 
end for the better part of 
the past two years. It’s what 
Michigan coach John Beilein 
envisioned 
for 
Matthews 
when 
he 
transferred 
from 
Kentucky three years ago as 
highly-touted, 
former 
five-
star recruit. But as consistent 
as his defensive impact has 
been, Matthews’ offense has 
only grazed the expectations 
set by those lofty high school 
accolades.
“I never doubted myself,” 

Matthews said. “I understand 
as a player you go through 
those times. It’s going to be 
more times in my career when 
I have bad games. I have a lot 
of basketball left in me. I never 
got discouraged and continued 
to shoot my way out of it, any 
bad moment.”
The game’s defining moment 
will be Matthews winding 
the shot clock down with 30 
seconds to go 
and a five-point 
lead, 
daring 
Wisconsin 
to 
stop him before 
hitting a step-
back, fadeaway 
jumper to seal 
an 
eventual 
61-52 win.
That, though, 
was 
merely 
a 
culmination 
of 
the preceding 11 minutes, in 
which Matthews went 7-of-8 
from the field, scored 14 points 
and fell three points short of 
single-handedly outscoring the 
Badgers.
“With 
most 
players, 
it’s 
very contagious,” Beilein said. 
“Just make a shot, and all of a 
sudden, you say, ‘Man, I got it. 
I got it going.’ Make two, ‘I got 
it going.’ You miss two or three 
in the row, it’s really hard to 
make the fourth, fifth, sixth. 

There’s no magic in that either. 
He made shots and then all of 
a sudden, he made more shots.”
The 
stretch 
began 
with 
11:22 to play, when Matthews 
— who had scored just four 
points over the game’s first 
29 minutes — answered a 
Kobe King jumper with a 
driving layup. As Wisconsin 
responded with baskets on its 
next two possessions, so too 
did 
Matthews, 
keeping 
the 
Badgers at arm’s 
length 
as 
they 
threatened 
to 
take their first 
lead of the second 
half.
Matthews’ 
baskets 
came 
during a stretch 
when 
none 
of 
his 
teammates 
could find bottom, finishing 
a combined 2-for-10 over the 
final 14 minutes. It’s a reversal 
of roles for Matthews, who 
often 
frustrates 
in 
these 
moments — as he did in that 
loss in Madison — stifling 
Michigan’s 
offense 
with 
ambitious mid-range jumpers 
and poor decision making.
“It’s definitely a huge boost 
being able to have a guy like 
Charles go against — utilize 
his 
mismatch,” 
Poole 
said. 

“Especially when he gets going, 
being able to give it to a guy in 
the post when he’s able to go 
to his go-to shot and knock it 
down is definitely huge.”
This time, though, it was 
his teammates providing the 
frustration. With three minutes 
to play and Michigan holding a 
tenuous three-point lead, Poole 
and junior point guard Zavier 
Simpson jacked up a pair of 
contested 
threes 
on 
consecutive 
possession, 
sending 
an 
irritated 
Beilein’s hands 
into 
the 
air 
with 
each 
miss.
But 
when 
Matthews 
caught the ball 
at the top of the arc amidst a two-
minute scoring drought with 
a 1:30 to play, that frustration 
quickly disappeared. He drove 
to his right, pulled up over Nate 
Reuvers and let go. And for the 
sixth time in ten minutes, the 
ball swished through the net.
So when he pulled up for 
that jumper a minute later with 
a chance to ice the game, the 
expectation was — for once — 
that it would fall through. And 
as it had all afternoon, it did.

THEO MACKIE

ALEXIS RANKIN/Daily
Redshirt junior wing Charles Matthews went 7-for-8 with 14 points in the last 11 minutes of Saturday’s game.

Already down 1-0 to No. 7 
Arizona in the bottom of the 
first inning and facing a bases-
loaded jam, the pressure was 
on for the No. 19 Michigan 
softball team. As the Wildcats’ 
Alyssa 
Palomino-Cardoza 
sent the ball all the way back 
to the wall, that lead seemed 
all but certain to drastically 
increase. But just as it looked 
like 
the 
Wolverines 
were 
going 
to 
face 
a 
five-run 
deficit, junior outfielder Haley 
Hoogenraad jumped up to grab 
the ball, calling an end to the 
inning and blocking Arizona 
from potentially gaining a 
substantial lead.
While 
Michigan 
didn’t 
win, strong defensive plays 
like that by Hoogenraad were 

instrumental to the success 
of the team all weekend, as 
she made several important 
catches in each game.
“Haley Hoogenraad plays 
one heck of an outfield and 
she makes some great plays,” 
said Michigan coach Carol 
Hutchins. “She does a great 
job for us. We just ask for 
everybody to do their part and 
if you’re in the outfield, if you 
can touch the ball, catch it. 
She’s done a great job for us 
over the years and she’s done 
nothing but get better and 
better.”
Added 
Hoogenraad: 
“We 
played pretty well over the 
weekend. I think we had a lot 
of really good plays and a lot of 
really smart plays. Our defense 
again looks like it’s going to be 
really strong.”
In the bottom of the fifth 

inning, another smart play 
came from Hoogenraad when 
she dove in the right field to 
make the catch and secure 
an out with two on base for 
Arizona.
“I think I had a couple 
of good catches that really 
helped keep us in the game,” 
Hoogenraad said. “The one 
later 
in 
the 
game, 
when 
there were runners on first 
and second, kept them from 
potentially scoring. Those are 
important.”
An 
aggressive 
outfield 
is 
nothing 
new 
for 
the 
Wolverines, a team known for 
their strong defense. Michigan 
had the third highest fielding 
percentage in the NCAA last 
season 
behind 
Oklahoma 
and Florida. This weekend, 
the outfield was anchored by 
veteran juniors Hoogenraad 
and Thais Gonzalez. The group 
was rounded out by Lexie 
Blair, a freshman who proved 
very useful on both sides of 
the game. Blair came out of 
this weekend with a perfect 
fielding percentage as well as 
four runs, just one run behind 
the team leader, senior Faith 
Canfield. 
“Defensively, 
I 
think 
I 
did pretty well,” Blair said. 
“I 
felt 
really 
comfortable 
out there, especially having 
two upperclassmen lead me 
and mentor me the whole 
weekend.”
Despite 
their 
solid 
performance this weekend, the 
outfielders hope their defensive 
play will only improve as the 
season continues.
“Collectively, I would say 
there were some hiccups in 
between each game,” Blair 
said. “With it being the first 
weekend, I think we did pretty 
well, especially from practicing 
indoor and coming here, being 
on a bigger stage and being 
outside. We did pretty well, but 
there are definitely things we 
can work on.”

I never get 
discouraged 
and continued 
to shoot.

He made shots 
and then all of 
a sudden, he 
made more.

As expected
In season’s opening weekend, Michigan wins three and drops two in Florida, its defense buoyed by Haley Hoonengraad

Going into the sixth inning 
against South Florida, the No. 
19 
Michigan 
softball 
team 
needed a spark.
The 
Wolverines, 
1-2 
on 
the weekend thus far, led the 
unranked Bulls 2-1, only scoring 
in one of the first five innings.
Michigan’s 
offense 
hadn’t 
fared 
much 
better 
in 
the 
first three games, with the 
Wolverines scoring only one 
run against No. 7 Arizona, 
none against No. 5 Florida 
and five runs total. The team 
pitched solid innings, caught 
essential fly balls and played 
tight defense, but scoring wins 
games, and Michigan wasn’t.
And then the sixth inning hit. 
Batting in four runs in addition 
to a and a grand slam in the final 
two innings, the Wolverines 
hit 
their 
stride 
offensively, 
notching a 10-1 win in their 
fourth game of the season.
In 
the 
USF 
Opening 
Weekend 
Invitational, 
Michigan went 3-2, beating 
North 
Carolina 
State 
4-3, 
South Florida 10-1 and Illinois 
State 11-4 but dropping games 
against Arizona and Florida, 
2-1 
and 
6-0, 
respectively. 
Despite 
maintaining 
strong 
defense throughout most of 
the tournament, the team’s 
offense 
fluctuated, 
starting 
slow and building up to strong, 
high-scoring wins to end the 
weekend.
Though Michigan started the 
tournament with a win against 
the Wolfpack, the team’s close 
game 
showed 
an 
offensive 
weakness for the Wolverines, 
who trailed 3-1 after the fourth 
inning and barely edged a win 
with three RBI in the fifth 
inning. Without power hits, 
that trend continued through 
Saturday morning in Michigan’s 
losses to Arizona and Florida.
Regardless, the Wolverines 
stand by their style of play, even 

with the hopes of an occasional 
power hit.
“I think we like consistency,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 
Carol 
Hutchins. “Whether we hit it 
over the fence or not, I want 
to see us air it out at times, 
especially when it’s in hitter’s 
counts.”
Despite the offensive lag, 
the 
Wolverines 
saw 
that 
power hit from senior second 
baseman Faith Canfield, who 
hit a grand slam against South 
Florida to energize the team’s 
offense before a decisive win 
over Illinois State. Canfield’s 
leadership, along with that of 
other upperclassmen, set a good 
example for young hitters like 
freshman outfielder Lexie Blair, 
who tallied seven hits on the 
weekend.
“Anything to help my team to 
be a spark plug, that’s my main 

thing,” Blair said. “One of my 
goals for me is to find any way 
to get on base.”
Even with highs and lows at 
the plate, Michigan’s steadfast 
defense anchored the team, 
most notably on the mound in 
freshman pitcher Alex Storako’s 
regular-season debut. Storako 
split 
time 
with 
sophomore 
pitcher 
Meghan 
Beaubien, 
and 
both 
performed 
well, 
allowing 1.13 and 1.06 WHIPs, 
respectively. Hutchins noted 
that Storako will be a force 
in the lineup going forward, 
surpassing sophomore Sarah 
Schaefer as the second pitcher.
“(Schaefer) needs to improve 
to get herself into the rotation,” 
Hutchins said. “... The first-
weekend timing is tough. I 
thought we got better as the 
weekend went, and that’s all I 
can ask.”

ALEC COHEN/Daily
Junior outfielder Haley Hoonengraad’s defense was instrumental in Michigan’s first five games of the season, in which which the Wolverines went 3-2.

Wolverines top Lions

Hailey Brown couldn’t miss. 
The sophomore forward was 
hitting three-pointers of varying 
difficulty, from all over the floor.
Within a span of five minutes, 
Brown single-handedly turned 
Sunday’s game on its head in the 
second quarter — from a nine-
point deficit to a one-point lead for 
the Wolverines by the end of the 
half.
Catalyzed 
by 
Brown’s 
performance, 
the 
Michigan 
women’s basketball team (16-9 
overall, 7-6 Big Ten) escaped State 
College with 66-62 win over Penn 
State (10-13, 3-9).
The beginning of the game 
could not have gone much worse 
for 
the 
Wolverines. 
Without 
freshman point guard Amy Dilk, 
sidelined with a knee injury, 
turnovers 
plagued 
Michigan’s 
offense.
“We were a little short-handed,” 
said Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico. “And with the quick 
turnaround, it was difficult to 
prepare someone to take over that 
role at the point guard position. I 
thought you saw that today with 
the pressure we faced early on.”
Penn State’s 12-point run finally 
ended in the closing seconds of 
the first quarter with Brown’s 
first three-pointer and a put-back 
layup from junior forward Kayla 
Robbins. Still, the Wolverines, 
having committed eight turnovers 
in the first quarter, trailed by four.
Michigan’s dismal offensive 
performance 
continued 
into 
the second frame. Senior center 
Hallie Thome had an especially 
disapointing performance in the 
first two quarters. She failed to 
make a single bucket, missing 
all 11 of her shots from the field. 
Thome also had two consecutive 
shots blocked downlow by Penn 
State’s Lauren Ebo. And on the 
ensuing possession, the Lady 
Lions capitalized with an open 
three to push the lead to nine. 
Dilk’s absence clearly put a dent 
into the Wolverines’ rotation, as a 
trio of seldom-played freshman — 
Danielle Rauch, Ariel Young and 
Emily Kiser — entered the game 

in relief.
Still, the Wolverines managed 
to stay in the lead by one in the 
first half as a result of Brown’s 
prolific shooting performance and 
two late free throws from Church, 
overcoming 13 first-half turnovers.
“I couldn’t even believe we 
were up by one,” Barnes Arico 
said. “Just watching the game it 
was like holy cow, we’re up. That’s 
the difference threes make instead 
of twos.”
Out of the break, Thome found 
freshman forward Naz Hillmon 
on the block for an easy layup. 
Shortly after, Penn State’s Taniya 
Page hit an off-balance floater and 
the back-and-forth nature of the 
second half was beginning to take 
shape.

“Hailey 
came 
in 
at 
the 
beginning of the week and said 
‘Coach, I’m just playing like myself 
right now, I’m in a little bit of a 
funk and need to get out of it,’ ” 
Barnes Arico said. “She spent a 
lot of time last year in the gym, 
getting up shots with (assistant) 
coach (Melanie Moore) and that’s 
what she did again this week. 
She played incredible. She really 
helped us to victory today.”
A three from the corner and a 
tough floater from the Lady Lions’ 
Siyeh Frazier gave them a three-
point lead with just under four 
minutes to go.
For her 18th and 19th points, 
Hillmon responded with a sweet 
spin move in the paint and a tough 
hook shot.
Tied at 62, Munger gave the 
Wolverines the advantage for 
good, pulling up from the foul 
line and hitting a jumper as the 
shot clock expired. Munger then 
hit two free throws to ensure the 
Wolverines secured their fourth 
consecutive win.
“That was one of the most 
exciting locker rooms I’ve been in 
after the game,” Barnes Arico said. 
“We had to have different people 
step up. Even if it’s only one play, 
those plays can be the difference in 
a close game. I think we saw that 
today. I think the kids have a little 
bit of confidence right now. We’re 
all about February. February is our 
month.”

With 5-2 win, ‘M’ completes sweep of Spartans

DETROIT — More than just the 
“Iron D” trophy was on the line 
when the Michigan hockey team 
took the ice on Saturday.
Coming into the annual “Duel 
in the D” against Michigan State, 
just five points separated the 
Wolverines — who are deadlocked 
with Minnesota for second place 
— from last place in the Big Ten 
standings. With Ohio State 11 
points ahead in the conference 
standings, and the battle for a first-
round bye effectively over, home-
ice in the first round of the Big Ten 
Tournament is on the line with 
each game.
Coming off a 5-3 win on Friday 
night at Yost Ice Arena against 
Michigan State, Michigan looked 
to complete its first conference 
series sweep of season. And, 
with the game still in the balance 
minutes into the third period, 
freshman forward Nolan Moyle 
collected the puck along the right-
side boards.
He sprinted up the right wing 
with no one to beat but Michigan 
State goaltender Drew DeRidder. 
As he curled in toward the slot, 
the freshman went forehand, 
backhand and fired into the top of 
the net to push the Michigan’s lead 
to 3-0.
The goal from Moyle would 
prove to be the difference maker 
for the Wolverines, who went on 
to win, 5-2.
The 
opening 
minutes 
of 
Saturday night’s contest featured 
back and forth play with both 
teams gauging each another.
Sophomore defenseman Quinn 
Hughes helped ignite the offense 
when he collected a loose puck 
that was heading toward the 
blue line and out of Michigan’s 
offensive zone. Hughes gathered 
the puck, skated up the left-side 
boards and curled in towards the 
net. He found sophomore forward 
Dakota Raabe, who was crashing 
the net as the play developed. 
Raabe’s one timer from the top of 
the crease gave the Wolverines a 

1-0 lead, 5:30 into the first period.
Michigan State struggled to get 
into their offensive sets early on. 
After generating a few chances, 
their momentum was halted by a 
penalty on forward Tommy Apap 
for boarding. And seconds into 
the power play for Michigan, the 
Wolverines extended their lead to 
2-0.
Hughes launched the puck 
towards the net. It hit junior 
forward Nick Pastujov in front 
of the crease. Junior forward 
Will Lockwood then crashed the 
net and fired the loose puck past 
DeRidder.
The second goal gave Michigan 
the momentum for the remainder 
of the period and into the first 
intermission.
The Spartans came out in 
the second period with a more 
concerted 
offensive 
attack, 
challenging freshman goaltender 
Strauss Mann early on.
Forward Patrick Khodorenkdo 
drew in two Wolverine defenders 
as he floated towards the right 
faceoff circle. He laid off the puck 
across to forward Taro Hirose 
who was one-on-one with Mann. 
Hirose took a stride towards the 
net and fired a shot five-hole on 

Mann who came up with the save 
to preserve the two-goal lead.
Despite some defensive miscues 
in the second period, Mann’s 
performance in net sustained the 
two-goal lead heading into the 
third period.
“I can’t say enough about our 
goaltender Strauss Mann,” said 
Michigan coach Mel Pearson. 
“I thought he stood tall tonight 
and maybe didn’t have too many 
saves, but he had some great saves 
on some of their top players and I 
think he was a real difference in 
the hockey game.”
Minutes into the final period, 
Moyle provided Michigan with 
a three-goal cushion on his 
breakaway goal, increasing the 
lead to 3-0.
But the Spartans weren’t dead 
yet.
A goal from forward Mitchell 
Lewandowski from a rebound 
off Mann’s stick cut into the lead, 
3-1, with just under seven minutes 
remaining in the game.
Less 
than 
three 
minutes 
later, the Spartans would get 
another one back. Defenseman 
Jerad Rosburg weaved entered 
the 
offensive 
zone, 
weaving 
through the defense and into the 

slot. He laid the puck across to 
Lewandowski to make the game a 
one-goal contest, 3-2.
“When the first one went in, I 
was nervous then,” Pearson said. 
“Second one goes in and you have 
to stay positive. You have to keep 
your bench calm and positive and 
I think that’s the biggest thing. I 
knew we were in a dogfight.”
The comeback fell short for 
Michigan State, though. Redshirt 
sophomore Luke Morgan and 
freshman Nolan Moyle scored 
empty net goals in the final two 
minutes to push the lead to 5-2.
For the third consecutive season 
now, the Wolverines are taking 
home the “Iron D” trophy. But 
more importantly for Michigan, 
it now sits alone in second place, 
three points ahead of third-place 
Minnesota.
“It was a huge weekend for 
the team,” Pearson said. “A big 
weekend. 
Anytime 
you 
play 
Michigan State it’s a huge weekend 
but with the implications of the Big 
Ten standings and everything, I 
thought it was a huge weekend for 
our team. Now, we get to enjoy it, 
maybe on the bus ride home, but 
Tuesday we get right back at it 
against Notre Dame.”

Wolverines exact revenge, top Wisconsin 62-51

It was ugly as ugly gets, and 
Michigan will take it just fine.
When Wisconsin comes to 
town, there isn’t any other 
option.
And, as the ball found Zavier 
Simpson at the top of the arc 
with just over three minutes 
to go, the Wolverines up by 
three and a chance to put the 
Badgers away materializing, 
it seemed they had managed 
to beat Wisconsin at its own 
game. Then, the shot clanked 
off the rim.
That 
scene 
replayed 
throughout the second half of 
Saturday’s game — Michigan 
finding an open three and being 
unable to convert, the Badgers 
hanging on as a result. Finally 
though, with 1:28 to go, it was 
Charles 
Matthews 
finding 
nylon, not from 3-point range, 
but his usual spot on the right 
block, giving the Wolverines a 
five-point lead.
A minute later, time winding 
and the crowd at its crescendo, 
it 
was 
Matthews 
again, 
bouncing a few feet in front of 
the free throw line and nailing 
another jumper, extending the 
lead to seven. 
It would prove 
decisive as No. 7 
Michigan (22-2 
overall, 11-2 Big 
Ten) found its 
way to a 61-52 
win over No. 19 
Wisconsin (17-7, 
9-4).
“This is who 
I believe — what 
I 
envisioned 
for (Matthews) when he came 
here,” said Michigan coach 
John Beilein. “And there’s been 
times in the games that he’s not 
sure what he should do. Should 
he shoot it? Should he take it to 
the basket? Should he pass it? 
… In this second half, he had 
a great mix of making those 
decisions.”
Three weeks ago in Madison, 
the 
Badgers 
handed 
the 
Wolverines their first loss of 
the year, fans storming the 

court as players filed out, backs 
turned.
Michigan didn’t forget.
“People storming the court, 
we don’t like that,” Beilein said. 
“... It’s not like, ‘Wow, they’re 
storming the court on us?’ No, 
it’s like, ‘No, we don’t like that 
situation.’ 
Our 
kids were pretty 
fired up about 
playing, because 
they haven’t lost 
much.”
For 
much 
of 
Saturday’s 
rematch, 
the 
first 
game 
seemed 
to 
be 
on repeat. Only, 
the Wolverines 
were in front.
The score was deadlocked 
at 27 going into halftime and 
stayed that way for nearly three 
minutes, the second half’s first 
review happening before its 
first bucket. It was emblematic 
of the game — a slow, unyielding 
stretch in which neither team 
played well and yet you couldn’t 
look away.
Without a single 3-pointer 
falling for Michigan in the 
second half, Matthews held the 

key to Michigan’s offense. The 
redshirt junior hit midrange 
shots, got to the rim and 
even found junior center Jon 
Teske for an and-one layup by 
spinning a pass around Nate 
Reuvers’ back. He finished 
with 18 points, 16 in the second 
half, on 9-of-15 
shooting.
“He was able 
to get his shots,” 
said 
sophomore 
guard 
Jordan 
Poole. 
“Just 
being aggressive. 
Picking his spots 
and (taking) the 
shots you know 
he’s confident in 
making and being 
able to knock them down down 
the stretch was huge for us 
today.”
Michigan had three weeks to 
find an answer for Ethan Happ, 
who dominated with 26 points, 
10 rebounds and seven assists 
when the Badgers toppled the 
Wolverines in Madison. Early 
on, it seemed nothing had 
changed. The fifth-year senior 
scored eight of Wisconsin’s 
first 10 points, going at, under 
and around Teske down low, 

finding repeated success.
After Happ picked up his 
third foul to start the second 
half, leading to a stretch on the 
bench, things shifted. Happ 
shot just 2-of-9 from the field 
over the final 20 minutes as 
Teske took the upper hand in 
the 
matchup 
on both ends, 
finishing with 
17 points and 
12 rebounds.
“The whole 
idea was, guard 
him 
without 
bad 
fouls,” 
Beilein 
said. 
“Well I think 
he 
guarded 
him about as 
physical as he could guard him 
in the second half.”
When the game ended, Happ 
found Beilein on the court, 
telling the coach he hopes to 
see him again this season. 
“No 
Ethan,” 
Beilein 
said, 
recounting the story, “I don’t 
want to see you again the rest 
of my life.”
In 12 seasons at Michigan, 
Beilein had beaten Wisconsin 
all of five times before Saturday. 
He’ll happily take the sixth.

If 
playing 
goaltenders 
Hayden 
Lavigne 
on 
Friday 
and Strauss Mann on Saturday 
guaranteed 
wins, 
Michigan 
coach Mel Pearson would run 
with it, no doubts in his mind.
Since Oct. 25-26 against St. 
Lawrence, it’s become evident 
that Michigan has struggled 
to close a weekend. Fans knew 
it. Pearson knew it. Michael 
Pastujov even admitted it.
“We struggle on Saturdays,” 
Pastujov noted.
After that series, Michigan 
has failed to sweep a series until 
last weekend against Michigan 
State, when the Wolverines 
completed their first Big Ten 
weekend series — exorcizing 
demons 
built 
throughout 
a 
string of ties and losses. Their 
record for Saturday games up 
until that point? Two wins, six 
losses and two ties that ended in 
losses.
“Yeah that was absolutely 
huge,” said junior forward Will 
Lockwood on Saturday’s win. 
“We’ve been getting a lot of 
Friday wins previous to that 
and to finally get over that hump 
was huge for our team. I think 
it’s great for our team and was 
well-deserved.”
The turnaround didn’t come 
out of nowhere. Pearson saw the 
struggles and knew something 
needed to be done. He needed to 
make changes.
“We’ve gotta clean some 
things up and we have to be 
better tomorrow,” Pearson said 
Friday. “I just told the team 
tonight that, you know what, 
enjoy it, but when you leave the 
rink tonight, this game’s over. 
This game’s over. So when you 
go downstairs and your friends 
or family or someone tells you, 
‘Oh, great game,’ just tell them, 
‘you know what, thank you, but 
we have to be better.’ ”
The first change he queued up 
was 
switching 
goaltenders.
“We’ll 
probably 
make 
that 
decision 
tomorrow,” 
Pearson 
said 
Friday 
on 
Saturday’s 
goaltending. 
“At this point, 
it’s 
open. 
I 
think Hayden’s 
played well but we’ve gotta 
find a way to win that Saturday 
game. We’ve gotta break this, 
‘win Friday and not do as well 
Saturday.’ ”
Lavigne 
had 
earned 
the 
starting job coming back from 
break. When the team needed 
his best in big games, he 
delivered. But the consistency 
in goaltending wavered on the 
second leg of a back-to-back 
series. In turn, Mann saw time 
in the net in the worst situations.
But after Mann displayed 
lockdown performances every 
time he was put in relief, 
Pearson started to entertain the 
idea of switching goalies on the 
backend of weekend series.
“He’s gone in a backup role 
but he played extremely well,” 
Pearson said. “He only gave up 
one goal in four periods last 
couple weeks in a mopped-up 
role, and we had do something 
to change the Saturday funk.
“And it’s not all on him, it’s 
not all on Hayden Lavigne. But 
sometimes we need a change, 
and sometimes coaches don’t 
want to change.”
The 
difference 
between 
wants and needs is something 
the coaching staff recognized 
during the game preparation.
All season, Pearson wanted 
the team to buy in and play 
hard-nose, hustle defense. The 
team didn’t realize they needed 

it until they came to grasp that 
changes needed to be made. 
For 
sophomore 
defenseman 
Quinn Hughes, he had to come 
to terms with it after his weak 
performance 
against 
Penn 
State on Jan. 26 — in which 
he committed several costly 
turnovers that directly led to 
opposing goals.
“First you have to own it,” 
Pearson said. “I think that’s the 
first thing is you have to own it 
to be able to move forward and 
make changes.”
Since then, Hughes and the 
rest of defensemen made strides 
in order to rectify the defensive 
lapses 
that 
sporadically 
occurred. 
Even 
amongst 
forwards, 
that 
defensive 
mentality carried over.
Against the Spartans, the 
team made changes that the 
fourth line — consisting of 
Nolan Moyle, Garrett Van Wyhe 
and Dakota Raabe — made 
earlier in the season. They 
worked harder, skated faster 
and put their nose to the ground 
to make plays.
“(The 
fourth 
line) 
play 
the right way,” Pearson said. 
“They’re 
not 
maybe 
your 
offensive stars, but they accept 
how they need to play. And I 
think that was a big key.”
Another key were changes 
made to the power play. In the 
Minnesota 
series, 
Michigan 
drew 
10 
power 
plays. 
It 
converted none of them.
To reverse their inability to 
convert 
the 
man-advantage, 
the Wolverines made changes 
to their special teams. After 
the series against the Golden 
Gophers, the first improvement 
they made was to get the 
puck around faster. Getting 
defensemen out of position was 
a key factor to power plays, and 
junior Jake Slaker noted the 
team needed to move the puck 
faster to do just that.
Against 
the 
Spartans, 
Michigan saw those changes 
pay off.
“We 
made 
some changes,” 
Pearson 
said. 
“We didn’t get, I 
think, anything 
from it, but we 
had some good 
looks. But we 
just — I thought 
they 
looked 
much 
better. 
But we have to 
continue to work on that and be 
a threat and that’ll really help 
our game.”
With the changes at hand, 
the Wolverines pulled out the 
broom for the second time this 
season. And it was an opportune 
time.
The sweep put Michigan 
solely in second place in the Big 
Ten with 30 points. With only 
six points separating second 
place from second-to-last place, 
a single bad week can cost a 
team home advantage in the 
upcoming Big Ten Tournament.
“Every win is huge at this 
point in the season,” Moyle said. 
“And I think this weekend can 
really turn around our season 
and we just need to continue to 
ride this wave.”
Added Pearson: “We’ve got 
five games left now and we have 
to grind it out. But this should 
give us some confidence and 
we’ve got a, like I said, short 
turnaround.
“I can’t stress enough how 
important this weekend was. 
I think we’re up on State six 
points now with a game in hand. 
That’s huge this time of year. It’s 
hard to make up points because 
everybody’s playing the same 
teams. Everybody is playing 
each other. Someone’s gonna 
win, someone’s gonna lose, so 
it’s important if you can string a 
sweep together.”
