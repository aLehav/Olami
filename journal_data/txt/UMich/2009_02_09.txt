MICHIGAN STUDENT ASSEMBLY
Two cands
emerge for
MSA pres.

Michigan Action
Party dissolves, new
parties set to form
By TREVOR CALERO
Daily News Editor
Over the past five semesters, the
Michigan Action Party has main-
tained a monopoly over the Michi-
gan Student Assembly, claiming a
majority of the seats on the assem-
bly since the party's inception in
2006.
But the students who actually
decide to vote for this year's stu-
dent government election will not
see the party known for its hot
pink and black campaign pam-
phlets anywhere on the ballot.
Faced with an internal struggle

body - further magnified by
recent criticisms from their con-
stituents - two representatives
have chosen to forgo the MAP dis-
tinction in search of a new direc-
tion for MSA.
Engineering junior Abhishek
Mahanti and LSA junior Gibran
Baydoun will run in opposition
to one another for MSA president
under the banner of two new par-
ties.
When MAP got together last
month to decide who it was going
to run as its candidates for the
upcoming March election, it chose
Baydoun and Mahanti to run as
its president and vice president,
respectively.
The two then met, along with
other party members, to outline
their platform. During their dis-
cussions, both Baydoun and Mah-

How the LSA Student
Government spends the
$1.50 in fees you give it

Apps from abroad
expected to rise

ASIA BUSINESS CONFERENCE

By DANIEL STRAUSS
Daily StaffReporter
LSA Student Government is
the student government body
that presides over the College
of Literature, Science and the
Arts. Its budget comes from a
$1.50 that each LSA student is
billed per semester. The money
is received by the student body
usually in the first three weeks
of school or so. Then the LSA-
SG treasurer begins dividingthe
money up based on applications
by student groups and in coordi-
nation with LSA-SG committees.
WHERE YOUR $1.50 GOES

Examples of such committees
are Academic Affairs, which
works with the university to bet-
ter the academic life of LSA stu-
dents, and the Public Activities
Committee which plans events
for students. Other student
groups and clubs submit budget
proposals to LSA-SG to allocate
some of the budget. LSA-SG's
committees and its treasurer
in particular then decide if the
budget proposals are worthy of
allocations and if enough money
is available. If everything works
out, the student groups then get
the money.

Officials say
largest increases
could come from
India and China
By KYLE SWANSON
Daily StaffReporter
University administrators
expect international applications
to soar this year, andthey're saying
that Michael Phelps might be one
of the reasons why.
Provost Teresa Sullivan report-
ed that while the number of under-
graduate applications is expected
to remain in line with previous
years, international freshman and
graduate applications have greatly
increased. Sullivan said she is con-
cerned with whether admitted
students will choose to attend the
University.
The largest increases among
international applications have
been from China and India, she
said.
"We really don't have anything
more than some hypotheses about
it," she said.
One possible reason for this
increase is Michael Phelps's suc-

cess in the Olympics and his
appearances in Michigan apparel,
University President Mary Sue
Coleman said with a laugh at a
meeting last month.
"The Michael Phelps hypoth-
esis is aninteresting one," Sullivan
said.
The meeting took place before a
recent incident involving a photo-
graph that showed Phelps smoking
a marijuana pipe.
Sullivan said other possibilities
are the University's "very success-
ful" joint institute in Shanghai or
another program that has allowed
70 transfer students to join the
College of Engineering.
"One possibility is that they've
e-mailed people back home and
said Michigan is a great place to
be," she said.
Taking into account the
increased number of international
applications, Sullivan said she is
uncertain about whether or not
the University will be able to accu-
rately predict this year's yield. A
school's yield is the percentage of
admitted students who actually
choose to attend.
"We're holding the line in the
sense that we're goingto admit the
number of people that we think

Maryland mulls campus gun ban

BREAT(TN' TN THE BTALLTROOMf

A proposedlawinMaryland would
ban guns, knives and other deadly
weapons from college campuses in
the state, The Diamondback at the
University of Maryland reported.
An existingstate law bans weap-
ons from K-12 public schools, but
the proposed Weapon-Free Higher
Education Zones bill would extend
that ban to college campuses.
TheUniversityofMaryland'sUni-
versity Police spokesman Paul Dil-
lon said in the article the bill would
improve safety on campus. Chris
Banerjee, president of Maryland's
chapter of the College Republicans,
said it would prevent students from
protectingthemselves.
Those who oppose the law say it
violates the U.S. Constitution's Sec-
ond Amendment.
"I think that the Second Amend-
mentguarantees the right of law-
abiding people to own firearms,"
Banerjee said. "The Constitution
doesn't stop at the border of Route 1

and the University of Maryland."
AL-QUDS UNIVERSITY AND
BARD COLLEGE JOINT COLLEGE
Al-Quds University in East Jeru-
salem and Bard College in New York
will establish a joint college called
The Al-Quds Bard Honors Col-
lege for Liberal Arts and Sciences,
The Chronicle of Higher Education
reported.
The joint college will be based
on the model Bard created with St.
Petersburg University in Russia 10
years ago. The college will open
in September 2009 on the Al-Quds
campus and plans to accept 100 new
students each year. Sixty students
have already enrolled for next fall.
The two colleges are also work-
ing to create a joint high school on
the Al-Quds campus as well that
is expected to open in fall 2010.
"Al-Quds and Bard College are
initiating partnerships with pub-
lic schools in the West Bank and

Jerusalem representing different
models of student learning," Bard
officials wrote ina statement.
BUILDING STANDS UNFINISHED
AT UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO
A $63 million building at the
University of Colorado at Boulder
remains unfinished, The Daily Cam-
era reported.
"We've got a gigantic concrete
shell of a building at the heart of
our campus," Colorado University
spokesman Bronson Hilliard said.
"It's importantwe complete it."
Work has halted due to a state
construction freeze last fall. The
state had allocated $18.47 million
to the building's construction, but
because of the freeze, the University
will not receive the funding.
Once completed, the 170,000-
square-foot building will contain
an art museum and the school's
Department of Art & Art History.

Unemployed use time

Some have used
break to get healthy,
but many are
worried about bills
FOND DU LAC, Wis. (AP) - Jay
Capelle would give anything to get
back his factory job of 32 years. At
the same time, he's grateful to have
extra time on his hands these days
to care for his ailing wife, stay in
shape and work on a long-planned
baseball documentary.
The unemployed are stressed out
about unpaid bills, dashed retire-
ment plans and the loss of work-
place camaraderie. But many say
life minus work also has its bitter-
sweetupsides, including more time
with family and friends, learning
new skills, focusing on their health
and pursuing hobbies.
There is a widerange ofopinions,
of course, about just how sweet, or
bitter, the experience has been.
An idled auto worker in Wis-
consin cherishes extra time with
his kids, and his guitar. A former
communications worker in Vir-
ginia finds time for hiking as a
distraction from the job search.
But two jobless friends in North
Carolina who've played plenty of
golf together say enoughis enough:
they're ready again for the joy of
earning a paycheck.
All of these people said they
would give up their newfound free
time in a heartbeat if they could
land jobs. And most spend hours
each day trying. But as unemploy-
ment spells drag on longer than
anticipated, they have allowed
themselves to enjoy activities not
directly related to the job hunt
without feeling guilty.

Alex Swain, 36, of Leesburg, Va.,
said his fruitless search for work
has been discouraging. Since los-
ing his job last April at a wireless
communications company, Swain
has applied for more than 200 jobs,
gone on 10 interviews and has not
had a single offer.
But rather than sulking in front
of the television when he's not
searching online job postings,
Swain forces himself to keep up
with hobbies like playing music,
painting and hiking.
"You can't stay inthe house all day
or you'll lose your mind," he said.
Others are spending time in the
classroom.
Andre Lovato, 55, of Waukesha,
Wis., who was laid off from his job
at a signmaking company in 2006,
earned a degree in printing and
publishing from a technical col-
lege in December. Lovato, who has
applied for 35 jobs since then with-
out any luck, devotes his free time
to woodcarving, sketching and
computer illustrations.
But as his unemployment drags
on, he longs for interaction with
colleagues and getting praise for a
job well-done.
"I miss showing my work and
having people say, 'Hey man, you
did pretty good stuff,"'he said.
Brad Palzkill, 39, was laid off
from the General Motors plant in
Janesville, Wis., last June. This
means the family can't afford to eat
out as often, and the kids' Christ-
mas gifts were less extravagantlast
year. But he doesn't miss installing
hundreds of consoles in trucks
every night, which took a toll on his
knees and wrists; and it's nice to
have more free time to spend with
family and strumming his guitar -
when he's not looking for work.
"Before, I used to go to work at 4

p.m. and I'd just see my kids on the
weekends. But this is not the way
you want it to happen," he said,
In the suburbs of Raleigh, N.C.,
golf buddies Eddie Shearon and Wes
Davis-bothofwhomhavebeenjob-
less for more than a year - saythey
feel an urgency to get back to work
so they can have'incomes again.
But they're not eager to give up
the perks of being unemployed.
In addition to rounds of golf,
Shearon, 52, now gets to walk his
dog every afternoon and make din-
ner for his wife. "I've reacquainted
myself with my wife," he said. "We
haven't seen each other that much
for 20years."
For others, the appreciation of
extra free time is fleeting.
Diane Rohan,37,said she enjoyed
her early months of unemployment
after giving up her job as a baker to
move to Los Angeles with her hus.
band. She scanned photo negatives
onto her computer and, truth be
told, enjoyed sleeping late.
"That wore off after about a
month," she said.
David Pemberton, of Smyrna,
Tenn., is using his July layoff from
Catholic Charities of Tennessee
as an opportunity to forge a new
career in health care. "I know God
has something in store down the
road for me," he said.
Capelle, 60, gets depressed and
angry when he dwells on the loss of
his job at a plant that manufactures
boat motors. But he is often appre-
ciative that he can now offer more
help to his wife, who is recovering
from knee surgery.
He even found a silver lining to
the June flood that ruined his base-
ment, the red truck he loved and
some of his video equipment. He
received a $35,000 insurance settle-
ment, which he has used to pay bills.

Substantial scholarships, up to full-tuition, are now
being awarded to top applicants for a new one-year

NEWS BRIEFS
CONCORD, N.H.
*Recession sending
more students to
community colleges
College freshman Elizabeth
Hebert's choice of a four-year
school suddenly got too expensive.
George Haseltine already has a
business degree, but he concluded
after several layoffs that he needed
more training to get work.
So, in the middle of this school
year, both landed at New Hamp-
shire Technical Institute, which
like other community colleges
across the country has suddenly
grown a lot more crowded.
Thetwo-year schools are report-
ing unprecedented enrollment
increases this semester, driven by
students from traditional colleges
seeking more bang for their buck
and by laid-off older workers.
But community colleges aren't
exactlycheeringinthis down econ-
omy: Tuition doesn't come close to
covering costs, and the state funds
used to make up the difference are
dryingup.
Final figures aren't in for this
semester, but a national group rep-
resenting community colleges says
the average increase from spring-
to-spring is dramatic, and similar
to what New Hampshire is report-
ing at its seven schools - a range of
4 percent to 19 percent.
CHICAGO
Drugmakers spend
millions to boost
"murky" illness
Two drugmakers spent hun-
dreds of millions of dollars last
year to raise awareness of a murky
illness, helping boost sales of pills
recently approved as treatments
and drowning out unresolved ques-
tions - including whether it's a real
disease at all.
Key components of the indus-
try-funded buzz over the pain-
and-fatigue ailment fibromyalgia
are grants - more than $6 million
donated by drugmakers Eli Lilly
and Pfizer in the first three quar-
ters of 2008 - to nonprofit groups
for medical conferences and edu-
cational campaigns, an Associated
Press analysis found.
That's more than they gave for
more accepted ailments such as
diabetes aF- lsheimer'sA-ong0
grants tied to specific diseases,
fibromyalgia ranked third for each
company, behind only cancer and
AIDS, for Pfizer and cancer and
depression for Lilly.
Fibromyalga draws skepticism
for several reasons. The cause is
unknown. There are no tests to con-
firm a diagnosis. Many patients also
fit the criteria for chronic fatigue
syndrome and other pain ailments.
SAN'A, Yemen
Yemen releases 170
al-Qaida suspects
Yemen released 170 men it had
arrested on suspicion of having ties
to al-Qaida, security officials said

yesterday, two weeks after the ter-
ror group announced that Yemen
had become the base of its activities
for the whole Arabian peninsula.
The announcement also comes
as government forces say they are
poised to sweep through the noi-th-
ern city of Marib to combat an
entrenched al-Qaida presence that
includes both Yemenis and Saudis.
The officials who announced
the release spoke on condition of
anonymity because they are not
allowed to speak to the press.
The men were freed Friday and
Saturday after signing pledges not
to engage in terrorism - a strat-
egy the Yemeni government has
often used with those suspected of
fighting in militant causes abroad.
HEALESVILLE, Australia
Australia's worst
fire disaster kills 76
Police say the death toll from
wildfires in Australia has risen to
76, making it the country's worst
fire disaster.
Authorities said the toll would
climb further as they reached fur-
ther into a huge zone of southern
Victoria state that was devastated
by scores of blazes during intense
heat and strong winds on Satur-
day.
Officials said they had gon-
firmed some 700 homes had been
destroyed in the fires that in some
cases have razed entire towns.
Victoria police spokeswoman
Rebecca Fraser said the latest
death toll is 76.

Colleges could receive
billion-dollar boost

Stimulus plan
could dramatically
increase aid for
students, states
DURHAM, N.C. (AP) - The
stimulus plan emerging in Wash-
ington could offer an unprece-
dented, multibillion-dollar boost
in financial help for college stu-
dents trying to pursue a degree
while they ride out the recession.
It could also hand out billions
to the states to kick-start idled
campus construction projects
and help prevent tuition increases
at a time when families can least
afford them.
But cuts of $40 billion for state
and local governments in the
Senate version were a big disap-
pointment for college leaders.
House-Senate negotiations will
determine whether education aid
to the states is relatively modest
or massive - and how much gets
directed to high-need institutions
for building projects, versus elite
universities that would benefit if
the final package spends more of
the money on scientific research.
Students are big winners. Both
the House and Senate bills call for
the largest-ever funding increase
for Pell Grants, the government's
chief college aid program for low-
income students.
It will take much of the pro-
posed $15.6 billion increase in the

House version (slightly less in the
Senate) just to erase the existing
funding shortfall and meet the
surging demand as the economy
sours and more students enroll.
But the package would also
increase next year's maximum
award by up to $500, to $5,350,
starting July 1. That's the biggest
increase in history and would cover
three-quarters of the cost of the
average public four-year college.
Most Pell recipients come
from families earning less than
$40,000. And supporters note the
new Pell dollars would be spent
almost immediately - students
can't save them - while also pay-
ing off down the road.
"Long-term, if we want a better
economy, we need more people
going to college," Education Arne
Duncan fold The Associated Press
last week.
College leaders meeting in
Washington this week for the
American Council on Education's
annual meeting will be grate-
ful for the student aid boost. But
they'll be closely watching how
Congress bridges the huge gaps
between how much the House and
Senate versions propose spending
to bail out state budgets and pre-
vent drastic education cuts.
The House bills calls for $79 bil-
lion to prevent cuts to local school
districts and public higher educa-
tion. But it's not yet clear how the
money might be divided between
K-12 and higher education, and a
portion could go to things besides

education. The Senate version
calls for $39 billion.
Meanwhile, colleges are hop-
ing Congress will agree restarting
idled building projects is an effi-
cient short- and long-term invest-
ment. As they lose revenues from
state support, endowments and
tuition, hundreds of projects are
on hold nationwide, from a library
extension at Fresno State to new
dorms at Washington University in
St. Louis and a biology lab at Yale.
The California State University
system alone has halted 130 proj-
ects,whichitvalues at$850million
and says account for 13,000 jobs.
Meanwhile, the system may have
to cut 10,000 enrollment slots.
The House bill has $6 billion
for such projects, while the Sen-
ate has none.
"We're readyto go, there'sgreat
jobs involved, and we're educat-
ing kids who wouldn't have other
opportunities if we weren't there,"
Chuck Middleton, president of
Roosevelt University in down-
town Chicago, said Sunday. His
university has a $135 million new
building with classrooms, labs,
dorms and offices on hold after
financing dried up. Construction
could be under way in six months,
he says, providing 600 jobs for two
years while helping Roosevelt's
diverse student body.
Also helping students, the
House and Senate both call for
expanding the Hope tuition tax
credit from $1,800 to $2,500 and
making it partly refundable.

Hero pilot describes
'sicken ing'feelingf
when birds hit plane

Capt. Chesley 'Sully'
Sullenberger talked
about the ordeal on
CBS's '60 Minutes'
NEW YORK (AP) - The pilot
who ditched his jetliner in the
Hudson River and saved the lives
of everyone on board said he had a
"sickening" feeling when a flock of
birds disabled both engines with
violent thuds, crippling the plane
at 3,000 feet over the nation's most
populous city.
Capt. Chesley "Sully" Sullen-
berger said in an interview with
CBS',"60 Minutes" that the sound
of the geese hitting the plane and
the smell of burning poultry enter-
ing the cabin was "shocking."
"Oh, you could hear them," he
said. "Loud thumps. It felt like the
airplane being pelted by heavy rain
or hail. It sounded like the worst
thufidetstoirt I'd ever heo dgro, re
ing up in Texas."
The interview with Sullenberg-
er and the other four crew mem-
bers was broadcast Sunday, their
first since US Airways Flight 1549
landed in the frigid water Jan. 15.
Sullenberger took control of
the plane from his first officer and
glided it to safety, but said that in
the aftermath of the emergency
landing, he lay awake at night
second-guessing his performance,
even though all 155 people aboard
survived.
He said he initially had trou-
ble forgiving himself because he
thought he could have done some-
thing different in that "critical
situation."
"The first few nights were the
worst," Sullenberger said. "When
the 'what ifs' started."

He said he no longer regrets his
actions that day, calling his deci-
sion to land in the river "the only
viable alternative" to attempting
a return to LaGuardia Airport or
landing at Teterboro Airport in
New Jersey.
"The only level, smoot' place
sufficiently large to land ai airlin-
er was the river," he said, recalling
that the plane had no thrust and
was "descending rapidly."
Sullenberger, a former Air Force
fighter pilot who has flown com-
mercial planes for nearly three
decades, said he knew he had to
touch down with the wins level
and the nose slightly up, ad "at a
descent rate that was survis ible."
"Did you, at any point, tray?"
CBS' Katie Couric asked.
"I would imagine someb dy in
back was taking care of that 'r me
while Iwas flyingthe airplan ,"he
said.
The flight attendants sai they
didn't know they were land ig in
the water until it happened,
"When I got out of my s at d
saw that water, it was tie must
shocked I've ever been in my life,"
flightattendantDoreenWelshsaid,
addingthat her emotions "had gone
through, within seconds, accept-
ing death and seeinglife."
She said she then "went crazy"
and started yelling and pushing
people to get them out because the
impact tore a hole in the plane's
tail and water poured into the
cabin.
"And as I was getting up, I
thought I might actually live,"
Welsh said. "'Cause a second ago, I
thought I was gone."
Sullenberger landed the plane
near two ferry terminals, and res-
cue boats appeared within minutes
to take the 150 passengers and five
crew members to safety.

President Barack obama meets with business leaders to discuss the economy in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in
Washington, yesterday.
Obama faces tough week ahead

President seeks to
unite a Congress
divided over the
stimulus package
WASHINGTON (AP) - Presi-
dent Barack Obama plunges into a
difficult test of his leadership this
week, struggling to get a divided
Congress to agree on his economic
recovery package while pitching a
new plan to ease loans to consum-
ers and businesses.
The Senate's $827 billion stim-
ulus legislation seems assured
narrow passage by Tuesday.
Harder work for obama and the
Democrats comes in the days
ahead, when the House and Sen-
ate attempt to reconcile differ-
ences in their two versions.
Obama and Democratic Party
leaders had hoped to have a bill
ready for the president's signature
by Feb. 16 - a goal that appears
increasingly unlikely.
At the Treasury Department,
Secretary Timothy Geithner
delayed the unveiling of a new

bailout framework for financial
institutions from Monday to Tues-
day. Geithner is considering steps
to broaden the use of a new lend-
ing facility at the Federal Reserve,
provide government guarantees
to help banks deal with their trou-
bled assets, and continue direct
infusion of capital into banks
in exchange for securities and
tougher accountability rules.
For Obama, the economy has
become a two-front engagement,
with one effort aimed at creat-
ing or saving jobs and the other
at unfreezing the credit markets.
Amid the urgency created by
nearly 600,000 new unemployed
workers last month and new bank
failures, Obama's economic pre-
scriptions are coming under criti-
cal scrutiny by both Congress and
the American public.
The House and Senate bills are
about $7 billion apart in cost and
overlap in numerous ways. But the
Senate bill has a greater emphasis
on tax cuts, while the House bill
devotes more money to states,
local governments and schools.
Lawrence Summers, Obama's
top economic adviser, signaled

the struggle ahead as he made the
rounds of Sunday morning, talk
shows. "There are crucial areas,
support for higher education, that
are things that are in the House
bill that are very, very important
to the president," he said on ABC.
.Rep. BarneyFrankofMassachu-
setts, the Democratic chairman of
theHouse Financial ServicesCom-
mittee, warned that reductions in
state spending in the Senate bill
would hurt local communities.
"To get any Republicans at all,
you had to adopt a cut that's going
to mean policemen and firemen
are going to be laid off," he said.
"Aid to the states is to prevent
this budget crunch from laying off
public employees. "
Sen. John Ensign of Nevada,
a member of the Senate Republi-
can leadership, dismissed Frank's
complaint as "fear-mongering."
The Senate bill is finely tuned.
With only two or three Republi-
cans on board, it is guaranteed,
at most, 61 votes; the bill needs 60
votes to advance and avoid proce-
dural hurdles. Any change in the
balance struck by the Senate bill
could doom it.

Releasing the funds
Shorter sentences will result in better prison policies
n addition to its more positive attractions - like the beautiful
Great Lakes and delicious Mackinac Island fudge - Michi-
gan is now one of only four states that spend more money
on prisons than higher education. More than 20 percent of the
state's general fund goes to the corrections system each year. The
high number of prisoners in the systems is partly due to Michi-
gan's release policies, which are much stricter than much of the
country. But with the state government needing to do all it can to
save money, the legislature is considering a new policy that could
save millions in its corrections budget by lessening the maximum
sentencing for prisoners. Such a change is long overdue, and the
legislature should implement this policy to free up state funding
and bring Michigan's treatment of prisoners more in line with the
rest of the country.

The Blac k(Berry);resident

Michigan spends $32,000 per year on
each prisoner. That's well above the nation-
al average of $23,876. And Michigan's more
than 40 prisons are home to about 50,000
prisoners. But not only does Michigan
house an excessive amount of inmates, it
holds them for longer periods than most
other states. A study published by the
Council of State Government showed that
the average maximum sentence in this state
is three times longer than the minimum -
another large difference from other state's
prison policies. These lengthy sentences
mean that Michigan sinks about $2.2 bil-
lion into the corrections system each year.
But a new policy, suggested in late Jan-
uary, could save the state $262 million
by 2015. Prisoners will be reviewed by a
parole board that won't subject them to
incarceration for more than 120 percent
of their minimum sentence. This change
attempts to match sentences to the com-
mitted crimes more reasonably. The policy
would still allow prisoners who are deemed
"high-risk" because of repeat or violent
offenses to remain in prison even after
served more than 120 percent of the mini-

mum sentence. Nonetheless, about 4,300
prisoners could be eligible for release.
Releasing these prisoners to save the
state money is more than just neces-
sary - it's desired. Michigan's correc-
tions department has been long-overdue
for a downsizing. And it's good that the
state is making cuts in places that should
be cut rather than from institutions like
higher education - upon which the state is
depending to diversify its manufacturing-
based economy. Long-term incarceration
does nothing to rehabilitate criminals back
into society, and Michigan's lengthy sen-
tences constitute a cruel and unfortunate
record.
In the long run, carefully returning
prisoners who don't need to be incarcer-
ated into society is better for them and the
state's budget. And Michigan needs to allo-
cate its funding in places that will use the
money to help boost the suffering econo-
my. Passing this policy is a necessary way
to cut back on spending while at the same
time softening Michigan's prison standards
to deal with prisoners more humanely
and responsibly.

arack Obama just wouldn't
back down. They told him it
simply couldn't be done, but he
said he would find
a way. That's just
how trailblazers
roll.
No, I'm not
talking about the;
presidential elec-
tion - that would
be very cheesy.
I'm talking about IMRAN
Obama's decisionto
do what a president SYED
in this age simply
must do: stay con-
nected. After winning the election,
Obama was told his texting days were
over. Citing security concerns and
the Presidential Records Act - which
theoretically makes all presidential
correspondence subject to public
review (eventually) - commentators
were pretty certainthat Obama would
be handing in his BlackBerry.
Bucking that expectation, Obama
has become the first emailing presi-
dent, though he's using a smart phone
you and I can only dream of - alleg-
edly a $3,350 National Security Agen-
cy-approved, supremely secure and
encrypted device called the Sectera
Edge.
The popular opinion is that this
is a great step forward for the presi-
dency and our democracy. I have to
agree that there's no reason for a man
to change who he is the moment he
becomes president and Obama has
shown that he understands that. And
yet I can't help but wonder about how
this will affect the stalker society we
now live in.
Any public figure should think
twice about texting or emailing after
seeing the example of disgraced ex-
Detroit mayor Kwame Kilpatrick and
his decidedly revolting (yet ground-
breaking) "text-sex" scandal. Jus-
tice was served in Kilpatrick's case
because he had a texting device and

exercised zero judgment in using it.
The justice part is all well and good,
but do you recall the morbid, sicken-
ing rapture with which that scandal
played out?
Maybe that's a bad example. (Then
again, can you imagine a Bill Clinton
presidency in the age of texting?) one
would certainly hope that we'll never
(again) have a president that will
have things so disgusting and unethi-
cal to text about. But still, that one
bad example is no exception. From
Michael Richards's racist tirade atl
the Laugh Factory to Christian Bale's
psychotic meltdown on the set of the
new Terminator movie ("What don't
you f@#!in' understand?"), we have
plenty of examples of how technol-
ogy is making public things that oth-
erwise would have stayed private.
While there hopefully won't be
any wild parties or illegal firings for
Obama's White House staff to text
about, there will be plenty of impor-
tant information being exchanged.
Obama himself might have a James
Bond-esque devicethat ispresumably
safe from hackers and wiretappers,
but his top staffers almost certainly
won't. In one form or another, those
texts will get out.
Perhaps you're among the major-
ity that see nothing wrong with that.
After all, all the examples I have
provided are of technology uncov-
ering wrongs that otherwise would
have slipped under the radar. But
may I suggest that there is a limit to
how much we should know about the
detailed, day-to-day inner workings
of our government? Or is that a hope-
less argument for all you Facebook
stalkers out there?
Interestingly, I recently read com-
mentary suggesting that a texting
presidency will be bad for our coun-
try for reasons entirely unrelated to
personal human privacy. In a post
titled "Obama's BlackBerry threatens
history," blogger Mark Everett Hall
lamented the fact that so much of

Obama's electronic correspondence
will be digital, deletable and inacces-
sible to historians. While I fear for
what might be revealed, Hall fears for
what might not.
What obama's
texting means for
our 'stalker' society.
In a way, our opposing view-
points don't disagree, but just show
that we're talking past each other.
For example, I agree that much of
Obama's correspondence will be wor-
thy of documentation for historical
purposes, but I doubt very much that
any of his texts or emails might be so
important.
As a society, we've come to respect
the work of bloggers, stringers, eye-
reporters and YouTubers a9 crucial
to an open, functional democracy in
the digital age. But with that must
come the grounding revelation ,that
government is still government tand
there are things about it that ought
to not be known. I know most readers
will greet those words with a scoff
of virtuous disagreement and that's
why I am afraid.
President Obama must have his
smartphone because texting is a fact
of life. But while he can have all the
encryption in the world, the only
thing that will truly protect the vital,
core intimacy of a functional govern-
ment is a conscious effort on our part
to draw a line.
But, of course, that's the whole
problem: Stalkers don't understand
boundaries.

A few weeks ago, the Daily pub-
lished a viewpoint about the costs
of Obama's proposed cap-and-trade
system (Cap-and-trade fantasies,
01/27/09). Although there were some
merits to the article, the author's
arguments regarding the effective-
ness of this policy and the importance
of climate change were seriously
flawed.
The majority of scientists and poli-
cymakers agree that climate change is
real and significant and the time for
debate is over. We've all read the sta-
tistics about temperatures changing,
sea levels rising and melting glaciers.
It may be hard to imagine how those
changes will affect daily lives, but
the effects are already occurring in
real and tangible ways. Drought and
changing rain patterns have turned
once-fertile farms in Sub-Saharan
Africa into deserts, and occasional
flash floods strip the land of topsoil,
causing more. farmers to move to cit-
ies. If global average temperature rises
two degrees (it's already risen by one
in the past century), scientists pre-
dict that Bangladesh will experience
such severe flooding that virtually the
entire country will be under water.
Implementing a cap-and-trade
system would narrow the scope of
the problems associated with climate
change. As the world's leader in ener-
gy use, we can have a tremendous
impact both domestically and abroad.
President Obama has not promised to
end global warming and, like all of us,
he understands we cannot solve the
problem completely. But the costs of
doing nothing would be far greater
than the cost of action. Many of the
criticisms concerning the cap-and-

trade program stem from the poten-
tial effects on the manufacturing
and energy industries. What these
critics fail to realize is that climate
change will have a far more devastat-
ing ecohomic effect in other sectors.
From 1980 to 1989, for example, the
United States suffered $80 billion
of weather-related property dam-
age. From 1988 to 1997, the country
incurred $290 billion in damages, of
which only $83 billion was covered by
insurance. If climate change contin-
ues on its current path, U.S. agricul-
tural yields could decrease 10 percent
by 2020. Though the immediate cost
of regulating emissions is higher than
what we are used to, we cannot afford
to do nothing.
Now is the time to make these
kinds of changes. The previous view-
point argued that the fragile economy
cannot handle the changes involved
in a cap-and-trade program. Yet this
ignores the benefits of increased
efficiency and investment in new
technology that lead to more jobs.
Furthermore, the U.S. is hardly the
first nation to implement such a pro-
gram. The European Union started a
similar system in January 2005 that
resulted in "a much higher reduction
in greenhouse gas emissions than the
U.S. without the catastrophic eco-
nomic consequences some predict for
Obama's initiative.
There are already cap-and-trade
programs in place even within the
U.S. The Chicago Climate Exchange,
a carbon credit exchange that busi-
nesses voluntarily join, started in
2000 with several big-name mem-
bers, including DuPont and Ford
Motor Company. Ten Northeastern

states began their own trading sys-
tem, the Regional Greenhouse Gas ,
Initiative, earlier this year.
There is alsothe criticismthatcosts
will be transferred to the consumer.
Regardless of any cap-and-trade sys-
tem, energy costs are going to increase
as traditional energy sources become
scarce. no matter what, increased
conservation will be necessary. Amer-
icans have enjoyed a century of cheap
energy and, as a result, use more than
anyone else. In 2002, the U.S. created
20 tons per capita of greenhouse gas,
compared to 12.2 tons per capita for
all wealthy nations and the 3 tons per
capita global average. There is huge
potential for energy conservation,
which could balance out increases
in household electricity costs. Some
electricity companies are already
encouraging people to save electricity
through metering and other monitor-
ing methods.
No one is claiming this will be easy
and Obama certainly never claimed
to be able to "solve" climate change.
But the risk involved in doing noth-
ing is too great to ignore. Even if all
the critics are right and the effects of
climate change are not catastrophic,
all we will have done is ensure that
our children and grandchildren will
have cleaner air, cleaner water, and
all of the resources that we have been
able to enjoy. If that is the minimum
that we will accomplish from tak-
ing action through government pro-
grams like cap-and-trade, it will be
well worth it.

Finding the right
reality show host

Reality competition - a cat-
egory which now includes
everything from classic
game shows like "Jeopardy" to exotic
ventures like "The
Amazing Race"
- is among the
fastest-growing i
television genres
of all time. And
* with so many new
shows popping JANVWE
up recently, there BLOM
are some shows
that succeed and many more that
are utter shit. One thing that can't be
underestimated (though it so often
is), is the importance the choice of
host has in making or breaking a
show's critical acclaim.
Last year the Emmys - the award
show everyone has yet to care about
- created a new category. It's one
that should have been around since
the Emmys first recognized reality
TV as a respectable genre: Outstand-
ing Host for a Reality or Reality-
Competition Program.
First of all, does anyone else think
it's funny that the Emmys isn't even
qualified to give awards with "Best"
in their names, instead settling for
the word "Outstanding?" Anyway,
harping on the Emmys aside, the
awards show actually did a good job
on this one. The new category is one
of the best ideas the Emmys has had
in a good long while.
Now, normally I'd be opposed
to anybody creating the possibility
for Ryan Seacrest or Howie Mandel
to win an award. I'd wince if I saw
them holding even a Little League
"Most Improved Player" trophy,
let alone an Emmy. Luckily, the
2008 award went to Jeff Probst, the
deserving long-time host of "Survi-
vor" and subject of one of my middle
school Halloween costumes.
But this award's purpose isn't just
to give Seacrest a good dose of rejec-
tion. It's to point out how crucial it
is for a show to have a good host if it
wants to succeed.
If you need an example, then come
on down. You're the next contestant
on "The Price is Right." The classic
game show lost a large chunk of its
viewership in the transition from
Bob Barker to Drew Carey - and for
a good reason. Barker had a hosting
knack that Carey still hasn't seemed
to pick up. Another prime example is
"The Weakest Link," which was pop-
ular not because of the game itself
but just because of the acerbic, bitter
wit of host Anne Robinson.
But in the same way that a great
host can invigorate an otherwise
plain program, a terrible host can
ruin even the best ideas. Now, I'm
sure you all have your own opinion,
but I'm going to go ahead and crown
my own choices for king and queen
of terrible reality competition hosts.
For king, I choose Chuck Woolery,
specifically for his work on "Lingo."
The game show is a smart little mix
between a spelling contest, Mas-
termind and Bingo. Unfortunately,
Woolery can't spell, he's certainly
not a mastermind and he probably
doesn't even fully understand how

Bingo works.
For queen, I'm picking a host from
a show you hopefully never forced
yourself to watch (but I did). "On the
Lot" was a reality competition run by
Steven Spielberg to find the next big
Hollywood director. The show was
hosted by the brain-meltingly irritat-
ing Adrianna Costa. Every time one
of the contestants' short films con-
tained an explosion or a fight scene,
you couldn't help but wish she'd get
caught in the crossfire. Her inability
to say anything insightful is yet more
proof that sleeping your way to the
top still works.
But the formula of "quality of host
equals quality of ratings" doesn't
always hold up. There have been sev-
eral anomalies in reality TV - shows
with good ideas and good hosts that
still, for whatever reason, don't suc-
ceed. That's why this new Emmy
category can be such a good thing, if
used correctly.
If only we'd had this category in
2002, for instance, then maybe "The
Mole" would never have been can-
Anderson Cooper
got shafted.
celed, only to return last year with
a much worse host and a lower pro-
duction value.
So who was this mysterious host
who could've, if officially recognized
for his awesomeness, saved "The
Mole" from premature cancellation?
None other than CNN's resident
heartthrob, Anderson Cooper. That's
right. One of hard-hitting journalist
Cooper's first accolades was for host-
ing a gimmicky (though absolutely
amazing and completely under-appre-
ciated) reality competition show.
In fact, there are several current
reality TV hosts who were, in my
opinion, snubbed. The foremost in
my mind is Cat Deeley of"So You
Think You Can Dance," which has
the unfortunate stigma of often
beingconfused with the much worse
"Dancing with the Stars." Not only is

If reality competitions are going to
continue to thrive - which I, unlike
many others I'm sure, think they
should - then their creators need
to realize the importance of a good
host. You wouldn't want to see Ryan
Seacrest hosting "Survivor" or Jeff
Probst hosting "American Idol" (or
Adrianna Costa hosting anything).
Also, the Emmys need to look past the
big-name shows to see the Anderson
Coopers and Cat Deeleys hidden
among the Seacrests and Probsts.

tantly, someone needs to fire Chuck

By ANNIE LEVENE
Daily Arts Writer
The best-selling self-help book by John Gray
offered neurotic singletons and couples a bit of
valuable eponymous insight:
"Men Are from Mars, Women **
Are from Venus." The idea
behind the book was that He's Just
people of different genders
might as well be from differ- Not That
ent planets in terms of their into YOU
emotional needs. But con-
sider this counter argument: At Showcase
Men and women may be and Quality16
planets away in terms of how New Line
they choose to communi-
cate, but when it comes to matters of the heart,
everyone is the same. Everyone is nuts.
A movie like "He's Just Not That Into You"
capitalizes on the inescapable fact that relation-
ships bring out the inner craziness in just about
everyone. After all, why deal with real messed-
up relationships when a movie can depict pret-

looking - scratch that, obsessively hunting
- for love in all the wrong places. Her break-
through revelation - some guys may "just not
be that into her" - is a catalyst for the rest of
the film, in which she and various other trou-
bled lovers try to understand the gap between
what is love and what is just game-playing.
The film is wisely stacked with bold-faced,
big-name stars, and the charisma of actresses
Drew Barrynore ('Lucky You") and Jennifer
Aniston ("Marley and Me") makes their scenes
some of the film's more enjoyable and touching
moments. Yes, the two play modified variations
of the characters they always play, but they're
charming nonetheless. Less can be said for the
men - they are basically props for women to
project their neurotic thoughts onto. But kudos
to Ben Affleck ('Smokin' Aces") who snagged a
role that will have moviegoers - particularly
females - "aww" in adoration.
"He's Just Not That into You" also boasts a
surprisingly strong plot considering its origin
as asingle line of dialogue uttered in a "Sex and
the City" episode years ago. Nevertheless, the
subject matter isnstill awfully cringe-worthy.

humiliation as instances of humor. Gigi's self-
delusion is played for laughs, but it's not funny
or entertaining. It's just sad.
The real deal-breaker for the film, how-
ever, is its overall message. After her optimis-
tic love-bubble is burst, Gigi explains to her
female coworkers that she is the "rule," not
the "exception," meaning that she, like others,
will never change men into what she wants
she want them tobe.
But the film still finishes wrapped in a tidy
bow with fairy tale endings and multiple love
matches. The movie demands that reality be
applied to relationships. But it also implies that
a simple crossing of fingers and heartfelt wishes
are enough to get that one true prince to get his
ass off the couch and onto a white horse in order
to sweep his princess away. And those two quali-
ties are at significant odds with each other.
If "He's Just Not That Into You" is this gen-
eration's self-help book, then everyone is in for a
world of trouble. Here's a real piece of relation-
ship advice: If you don't want to be forced to
obsess about the ins and outs of complicated love
lives, then this movie is probably not for you.

The Cr
Poll

By JACK PORTER '90s with his legendary band Guid-
DailyArts Writer ed by Voices, which garnered a
wealth of popular and critical rec-
'ert Pollard is one of the ognition. In the interceding years,
prolific recorded musicians it's understandable that the indie
tory, with stalwart may have lost a measure
,000 songs * of vitality. No surprise, then, that
is name. his latest songs ring hollow.
counting Robert The Crawling Distance shares
irojects, he - much in common with Pollard's
leased six Pollard earlier compositions. Simple,
s in the The Crawling lo-fi, 4/4-time guitar pop is his
two years Distance preferred mode of expression.
Someone Guided by Voices One difference is that both his
i tell him oddball lyrics and faux-British
.e a vaca- accent have become more promi-
ecause his haste might have nent - and annoying - than ever
the waste of discspace that is before. On this album, preten-
-awlingDistance. sion and boredom meet like star-
lard's best work was in the crossed lovers.

Right from the opening track,
"Faking My Harlequin," it's clear
that something is amiss. The shiny
guitar chords and metronomic
beats are inoffensive enough on
their own, but Pollard's timid war-
bling sounds out of place. His raw
and eccentric vocals clash with the
polished yet bland instrumental
elements. And his endless refrain
of, "It's just my luck, yeah," is hard-
ly inspiring.
"Cave Zone" manages to be
spectacularly worse. Its plodding
two-chord verses are monotonous,-
and the brain-dead lyrics are alien-
ating. Perhaps the most laughable
stanza is: "Come on, come on stop
trying to page me on the phone /
Come on, come on stop trying to
break me won't you / take me to
my cave zone." By the end of the
song, all that is clear is that Pol-
lard immensely enjoys yelling the
words, "cave zone."
The more cheery "The Butler
Stands For All of Us" suffers from
an entirely different set of prob-
lems. Cloyingly optimistic, its '70s
AM radio warmth dampens the
composition's impact. Likea senile
guru, Pollard dispenses such use-
less advice as, "It pays to know
who you are /'cause that's who you
are," and more obscurely, "Ease off
on your querulous side-kicks /stop
lurking behind them."

But the atrocities don't end
there. "It's Easy" sleepwalks
through a nursery-rhyme melody
and Pollard's'band plays without
enthusiasm. As an added bonus,
the track contains the album's
most deliciously awful lyric: "Safe
and please us / tax-exempt with
touchdown Jesus."
The Crawling Distance's litany
of flaws is almost comical. Not
only does Pollard pen insular
and silly lyrics, he sings them
in an affected British whimper.
So flawed it's
almost funny.
His band handles boring chord
progressions with mechanical
lameness. The disc's songs lack
dynamic thrust, failing to prop-
erly crescendo or climax. And the
minimal, dry production simply
augments its other failings.
When an album doesn't inspire
emotion, contemplation, imagi-
nation or even the simple urge to
dance, the musicians have done
their listeners a great disservice.
Pollard's latest lark achieves that
rare distinction; The CrawlingDis-
tance is worthless.

A locked box of thrilling escapes

By ERIC CHIU
For the Daily
When historians look back on
present-day American pop culture,
they're likely to
pick up on one
thing quickly.
Never mind the
countless shows One WayOut
about misan- Mondays
thropic savants at 9 p.m.
and fornicating Discovery
doctors and how
they say some-
thing insightful about American
culture - people just enjoyed seeing
other people do stupid things on tele-
vision. It's from this collective inter-
est that Discovery Channel's latest
show, "One Way Out," emerges.
"One Way Out" follows British
escape artist Jonathan Goodwin as
he attempts to escape from various
contraptions. If that sounds high-
concept, rest assured that the execu-
tion isn't. Still, the show's ability to
push the envelope in ways only basic
cable shows can, along with Good-
win's charisma as a host, makes for
watchable television.
Episodes loosely revolve around
testing theories, with Goodwin and
his collaborators performing vari-
ous small-scale stunts that lead up
to large-scale escapes. But basically
the premises of the show are excus-
es to put Goodwin into progressive-
ly more absurd situations.

The premiere opens with Good-
win attemptingto pull a scorpion out
of his duct-taped mouth while hav-
ing his hands zip-tied to atable and
being repeatedly slapped in the face
by his cameraman. Whether or not
"One Way Out" sounds appealing
probably depends on how strange
this all sounds. But the show's
appeal relies largely on the suspense
of Goodwin's performance.
Goodwin is likable enough, so
it's hard to root against him getting
out of the pickles into which he puts
himself. He garnered just as much
fame for successful stunts asbotched
ones in his native Britain, and thelat-
ter failures are generously depicted
in the show, which injects a sense of
danger into the final stunts.
Unfortunately, the biggest prob-
lem in "One Way Out" is what
The poor man's
'Jackass.'
comes before the major stunts. This
minor material is simply unneces-
sary and rarely hits the creative
plateaus and excitement of the big
escapes. The smaller bits between
each major escape are described
as experiments for the episode's
theme, but feel more like rejected
"Fear Factor" concepts. -


While preparing to enter a cage
full of bees, Goodwin lets his cam-
eraman and himself get repeatedly
stung by the bees. And in the second
episode, the two intentionally get
hypothermia. There's an exhibition-
ist vein running through these seg-
ments - but they're considerably
less fun without the grand scale of
the larger escapes. Watching Good-
win escape from a dumpster filled
with ice water that is covered with
a sheet of ice several inches thick
is unarguably entertaining, but
watching him get stung in the nip-
ple by a bee feels more voyeuristic
than enjoyable.

Still, solid execution forgives
much and "One Way Out" manages
to make the most of its admittedly
simple premise. Even if the abuse
it inflicts on Goodwin skirts into a
poor man's "Jackass" territory at
times, the escape artist's gusto and
the show's taste for absurdly esca-
lating danger make for some com-
pelling, if wince-worthy, television.

Organization brings in medical
personnel to discuss Darfur

Two people from
Doctors Without
Borders will speak
at event tomorrow
By JENNA SKOLLER
Daily StaffReporter
Will Work For Food, a stu-
dent group that raises money for
humanitarian efforts in Darfur,
will host an event featuring two
employees from Doctors Without
Borders tomorrow.
Dr. Hansel Otero and Nurse
Sally Najera will speak about
their experiences working on
various international relief mis-

sions 7 p.m. tomorrow night in
the Rackham Amphitheatre. The
speakers will primarily address
treating child malnutrition in
Darfur.
Doctors Without Borders is a
non-governmental, humanitarian
aid organization that sends medi-
cal personnel to developing and
war-torn countries.
LSA senior Steven Weinberg,
president of Will Work For Food,
said he hopes listening to the
speakers will help students better
understand the situation in Dar-
fur.
"We realizethatthecrisis inDar-
fur is something we're all removed
from," he said. "But we imagine
their first-hand experiences will
help people realize exactly what's

going on and will help them make
a connection to that."
The club also hopes to use the
event as a way to reach out to stu-
dents who want to contribute to
humanitarian efforts.
"We hope to educate (students)
about our organization and show
them what we're planning to do
and what we've been doing," said
LSA junior Lindsay Canvasser,
outreach chair for Will Work For
Food. "And we hope that they will
want to participate in the relief
efforts."
The club plans to present Doc-
tors Without Borders with its first
fundraising check, which they
hope will reach $5,000 by the time
of the event.
According to its website, Will

Work For Food combines local
community service with humani-
tarian efforts in Darfur.' Par-
ticipants are encouraged to ask a
friend or family member to spon-
sor their local service efforts, like
volunteering at a hospital or writ-
ing a lettet to a soldier, with a $10
donation.
The money raised goes directly
to Doctors Without Borders to
buy nutritional supplements like
Plumpy'nut, a peanut butter-like
supplement to treat refugees suf-
fering from severe acute malnutri-
tion.
The event is co-sponsored by
the Inter-Humanitarian's Council,
the Institute for the Humanities
and the Center for International
and Comparative Studies.


HUMAN RIGHTS
From Page1A
ical Company built a major
plant in the town. The company
bought out the houses of most
of the families living there and
pushed out the rest because of
hazardous toxins in the air pro-
duced by the plant.
There are more than 30 com-
munities in the United States
facing the same fate, Harden
said, and there is no govern-
ment requirement for safe dis-
tances of hazardous facilities
and residential communities.
She said this stems from the
fact that there are not enough
federal laws at the national level
protecting human rights.
"African Americans, or Lati-
nos, or Asian Americans or
Native Americans are getting
this toxic destructive stuff,"
Harden said. "We should have a
right to stop this."
Harden outlined basic
human rights as protection of
life; health, racial discrimina-
tion and privacy in the home.
Since the government is not
providing protection to peo-
ple in these areas, their rights
to life are being violated, she
said.
Harden commented that in

times of national crises, the
government can legally make a
situation worse under the cur-
rent instituted laws.
After the Sept. 11 attacks on
the Pentagon and World Trade
Center, . the government was
more concerned with opening
Wall Street than checking the
health situation at the site, she
said. As a result, many workers
developed fatal diseases from
the contaminated air.
Harden, a resident of New
Orleans in Aug. 2005, discussed
Hurricane Katrina and its after-
math from a first-hand perspec-
tive.
She said that after the disas-
ter, 750,000 people were dis-
placed and had no rights. She
added that instead of the gov-
ernment helping to get people
back into their homes, develop-
ers were taking over the prop-
erties.
The Bush Administration,
she said, viewed the recovery
in the Gulf region as a volunteer
effort rather than a federal obli-
gation.
Harden said there are laws
established to help these peo-
ple, but the government has not
enacted them.
"There is a basic floor of gov-
ernance, and we have a long
way to climb," she said.

FRESHMAN APPS
From Page lA
will give us the right size class," Sul-
livan said. "Because we're not sure
about the yield, we could be wrong
about that."
Each year, schools across the
country estimate their yield ratio.
Theythenadmitahigherpercentage
of students thanthey can accommo-
date, taking into account that some
of the students they admit will not
end up attending their school.
Sullivan said the University is not
the only college with doubts about
this year's yield.
"Thereason-we'reuncertainabout
this is not that we aren't sophisticat-
ed," she said. "I think if you called
any college in the country right now,
you'd get a similar answer."
Inrecenthistory,the Universityhas
received between 20,000 and 30,000
undergraduate applications from
high school seniors. Approximately
12,000 to 13,000 of these applicants
are admitted to the University.
Usually less than 50 percent of
students admitted to the University
choose to attend..
For University administrators
charged with balancing each year's
class size, an inaccurate prediction
of the yield could drastically affect
students' experiences on campus.
Even a 1-percent increase in yield,

could translate into a surge of
approximately 130 more students.
In 2005, the yield spiked, pro-
ducing a larger incoming class.
The large class resulted in a small
incoming class in 2006, and more
cautious approaches by University
administrators.
"Three or four years ago yields
went up ... more than we expected
and so that was this kind of big
bulge working its way through the
system," Sullivan said. "So we had
deliberately decided we were going
to be very careful to ratchet back
because we didn't want to have more
students than we had the capacity
to give this great education to.".
Despite uncertainties about the
yield, Sullivan said students should
know that the University will use
approximatelythe same standards in
makingtheir admissions decisions.
"The word I would give to a high
school senior right now is assum-
ing good grades, good test scores,
and a reasonable portfolio of other
activities, is your odds of getting
into Michigan this year are a lot like
they were last year," she said.
Despite the increase a few years
ago, Coleman said this year's num-
ber of applications is very similar to
last year.
"I feel like we're about the same
as last year," she said. "There are no
big surprises out there, that we've
seen."

For Tuesday, Feb. 10, 2009
ARIES
(March 21 to April 19)
Today you're quick to see how to
make improvements at work or intro-
duce reforms to the way things are done.
(Let's hope that others listen to you.)
TAURUS
(April 20 to May 20)
You might put a new spin on creative
projects today or anything related to the
entertainment world or the hospitality
industry. For example, you might
improve things in a restaurant.
GEMINI
(May 21 to June 20)
This is a good day to have discussions
with family members about shared pos-
sessions, inheritances and anything that
is held jointly. Others are ready to talk.
CANCER
(June 21 to July 22)
You might see new ways of earning
money, or making money on the side, or
discovering a source of income you had-
n't thought about before. Keep your eyes
open!
LEO
(July 23 to Aug. 22)
Take a look in the mirror today and do
a realistic assessment of yourself. What
can you do to improve the image you
reflect on others?
VIRGO
(Aug. 23 to Sept. 22)
Any kind of research will probably
pay off today. Dig deep, because you'll
find solutions to old problems. The
answers are waiting to be discovered.
LIBRA
(Sept. 23to Oct. 22)
A friend or a casual acquaintance
might say something quite profound to
you today. Or, perhaps. you are the one
who impresses others with your wisdom.
Keep your ears open.

SCORPIO
(Oct. 23 to Nov. 21) ,
Bosses, parents; teachers and VIPs
will notice you today, especially if you
have suggestions about improving some-
thing. Hey - you know how to cut
costs.
SAGITTARIUS
(Nov. 22 to Dec. 21)
Keep an open mind today, because
you might shiftyour values or your opin-
ions about politics or religion. Suddenly,
you're able to see things in a new light.
CAPRICORN
(Dec. 22 to Jan. 19)
Discussions about inheritances and
shared possessions can be productive
today. This can also pertain to mort-
gages, loans, insurance matters and debt.
AQUARIUS
(Jan. 20to Feb. 18)
Conversations with partners and close
friends are surprisingly candid today.
Make sure you don't try to improve the
other person, because this will stop the
conversation flat.
PISCES
(Feb. 19 to March 20)
If you have ideas about how to
improve things at work, speak up! You
might not want to do this, because at the
moment you seem tobe working behind
the scenes or working alone.
YOU BORN TODAY You're capable
of success in many areas; however, you
want appreciation for your efforts. When
you give your best, you need to be
prized. Indeed, many of you easily
attract attention. You're confident, and
you're a person of vision. (Just make
sure you don't sell out.) A major change
might take place this year, perhaps as
significant as something around 2001.

There's a difference between communicating ideas and experiencing them. It's the
difference between memorizing a foreign language and thinking in one. Between
studying ruins and excavating them. Between analyzing dreams and living them. The
difference is huge. And it's the very essence of the University of Chicago Summer
Session. Where students are engaged at every level-intellectually, socially, personally,
and professionally. Where you can benefit from the value of taking university courses
in an accelerated, intensive format. Join us this summer for an extraordinary learning
experience at the academic home to 82 Nobel laureates and the new U.S. President.

Switzer speeds below
four-minute mile mark

Delaware State
game is lose-
lose for 31'

Senior's 3:58:86 time
is fifth-best time in
Michigan track
and field history
By ROGER SAUERHAFT
Daily Sports Writer
The sub four-minute mile has
long been the measuring stick of
great long-distance runners, and
Justin Switzer joined the elite club
Saturday.
Switzer's 3:58.86 mile, although
just good for second place behind
Michigan State's Shane Knoll,
gave the senior the fifth-fastest
mile time in school history. Swit-
zer also earned the first NCAA
automatic bid of the season for the
No. 18 Michigan men's track and
field team.
"It's a big deal to break four
minutes in the mile," Michigan
coach Fred LaPlante said. "You
break four minutes - that's every
miler's dream."
Nate Brannen's 3:55.11 time in
2005 remains the fastest time in
school history.
LaPlante wasn't surprised by
his distance runner's stellar time
at this weekend's non-scoring
Meyo Invitational at Notre Dame.
Switzer also won the 1,500-meter
run in the 2007 Outdoor Big Ten
Championships as a sophomore,
and his coach said more top marks
might be on the way.
As Switzer and the Michigan
distance runners ran in South
Bend, the sprinters, hurdlers and
field athletes competed in the
Nebraska Husker Invitational in
Lincoln, Neb.
Michigan's 4x400-meter relay

(3:14:45) finished less than a sec-
ond behind No. 16 Nebraska, a
team LaPlante described as a very
formidable opponent. The time
was the team's fastest of the sea-
son and aided by senior All-Amer-
ican Andre Barnes, who returned
from an ankle injury that was
bothering him for six weeks.
Although Barnes ran in last
week's Indiana Relays, Barnes's
48.3-second split in the 4x400
marked more of a return to form.
"He's not where he's going to
"You break four

dream."~
be three weeks from now, but this'
week for him was great," LaPlante
said. "It's been a pretty tough time
for him ... but the other guys know
if he's running well, they get excit-
ed."
Barnes and senior distance
runner Lex Williams are get-
ting healthy just in time for the
Big Ten Championship meet in
three weeks. And senior Dan
Harmsen, another member of the
4x400-meter relay team, said this
weekend's meet also helped as a
confidence booster for next week-
end's Akron Open.
"We really needed to get a good
time," Harmsen said of his relay
team. "It started some momentum
for us, and hopefully we can push
that time down for next week at
Akron."

CHRIStOMBOAK/Oaily
Senior Justin Switzer ran a 3:58.86 mile at the Meyo Invitational on Saturday,
good enough for fifth-best in Michigan men's track and field history. Although he
didn't win the event, the time earned Switzer an NCAA automatic bid.

Athletic Dept.
should schedule
non-conference
games sooner
Circle Oct. 17on your cal-
endar. Michigan football
will lose on that day.
The Athlet-
ic Department
announced
Friday that
Delaware
State, a Foot-
ball Cham-
pionship
Subdivisionf
team, would
be the Wol- NATE
verines' oppo- SANDALS
nent on that
open date.
"I am happy
that we are able to announce
the completed football schedule
for this year," Athletic Director
Bill Martin said in a statement.
"We discussed the open date
with multiple schools and were
able to reach an agreement with
Delaware State. It's very difficult
to line up an opponent this late
in the process and we appreciate
the efforts made by each institu-
tion that we spoke with."
No matter what happens at
Michigan Stadium against the
Hornets, can only come out on
the short end of the equation.
Martin makes a good point
about the difficulty of schedul-
ing an opponent this late in the
game. But really the only per-
son he has to blame is himself.
Martin has control of football
scheduling, and perhaps with
a little bit more prior planning,
Michigan would have a chance to
win on Oct. 17.
Here's why Michigan is des-
tined to lose that Saturday:
First, Michigan is expected to
win, and even a 50-point victory
won't impress everyone.
Second, Michigan is expected
to win. And if it loses, it will be
the Apocalypse all over again.
Third, a win over a second-tier
opponent could prevent Michi-
gan from a trip to the Rose Bowl.
The Big Ten's third tiebreaker
for the conference title reads as
follows: "If there is still a tie for
the championship, or if the tied
teams did not play each other,
the team that played more games
against Football Championship
Subdivision (FCS) teams shall be
eliminated."
The Wolverines are going to
lose on Oct. 17, even though the
scoreboard will probably show
them ahead of Delaware State at
the end of the game. There's no
time to fix this problem for this
coming season, but it can cer-
tainly be avoided in the future.

Martin needs to start looking
for top-notch home-and-home
agreements with other BCS
schools.
The Notre Dame series is
excellent, and maybe both pro-
grams will be good again some-
day. But there will always be
tradition in that matchup which
should continue.
Beyond the Fighting Irish,
Martin should be looking for
another big non-conference
opponent.
Oregon hosted Michigan in
2003 and won. The Ducks came
to Ann Arbor in 2007 and won. It
was a 0-2 series for the Wolver-
ines, but those games generated
a lot more excitement than the
Delaware States of the world
ever will. In addition, the chance
to play against top opponents like
Oregon will better prepare Mich-
igan for the Big Ten schedule and
a potential bowl game.
Of course, money is a signifi-
cant issue when it comes to craft-
ing the non-conference football
schedule. Home football games
aren't just good for the Athletic
Department coffers, they're more
like winning the lottery seven or
eight times a year.
It's a significant loss in rev-
efue when the football team has
to give away a future home game
to bring in a big-name oppo-
nent to the Big House. Martin
deserves credit for arranging
home games against Vanderbilt
and Utah in recent years with-
out having to return the favor at
their place.
Michigan doesn't need a big
home-and-home setup every
year, but every few years would
be a good idea. Think about the
hype Ohio State has gotten for
its recent home-and-home with
Texas and its current series with
Southern California.
Scheduling a quality home-
and-home might actually bring
money to the Athletic Depart-
ment in the long run.
If Martin can schedule a game
against a school ina city with a
big alumni base (think Michigan
versus Rutgers at Giants Stadi-
um), there could be big donations
to help soften the blow of losing a
home game.
Michigan can continue sched-
uling two MAC teams, an FCS
team and Notre Dame each year,
and it will still sell out every
home game and be one of the
most popular programs in the
country.
But doing so is a disservice to
both the fans and the team, both
of which deserve better.

Brady sports retro suit, mustache
to break Spitzs SU pooi record

The Wolverines
haven't lost to the
Spartans in a dual
meet since 1976
By RYAN A. PODGES
Daily Sports Writer
EAST LANSING - Michi-
gan men's swimming and diving
coach Mike Bottom was pretty
excited when he realized junior
Chris Brady would have a chance
to break one of Mark Spitz's final
collegiate pool records this Sun-
day at Michi-
gan State.
But there a
would be'some
rules. y
Bottomt
wanted it to be
done as close
as possible to BRADY
the way Spitz
himself set the
record.
To do that Brady had to do three
things: swim fast, wear just a sim-
ple Speedo suit (instead of a high-
tech Speedo LZR racer bodysuit)
and, most importantly, grow one
of Spitz's signature mustaches.

When the Wolverines and
Spartans met in East Lansing, his
preparation paid off. Sporting a
traditional Specdo suit and a mus-
tache, Brady smashed Spitz's pool
record in the 100-yard butterfly by
1.61 seconds. The record had stood
since 1972, the same year Spitz
won a then-record seven gold met-
als at the Munich Olympic Games.
Spitz set the record as a senior at
Indiana.
"It was pretty awesome because
it was Mark Spitz, and everyone
knows who he is," Brady said. "It's
so exciting to do because of who
he is and what he has done. So its
special. Mike told me I should be
trying to beat it, and he wanted me
to look as retro as possible."
No. 3 Michigan went on to win
the meet, 176-109. The victory
completed the team's regular-sea-
son competition. The Wolverines
were perfect in Big Ten dual meets
(6-0) and lost only once all year, to
No. 1 Texas in November.
The final results were surely no
surprise to either team. The Wol-
verines lead the all-time series
between the in-state rivals 79-5.
The Spartans' last win in the
annual battle came in 1976. No
other Michigan varsity team has
a longer active win streak against
Michigan State.

Despite the lopsided series, Bot-
tom said his team still had a lot to
gain from the competition.
"I think that it's good for these
guys to come over and swim in a
pool they're not used to," he said.
"This is not an easy pool to swim
in. It's a six lane pool. It's shallow
at one end, and you're starting off
the bulkhead, which is different
"It was
pretty awesome
because it was
Mark Spitz,"
for us. Any time we come into a
different situation, it's good for us
to learn how to adjust and learn
how to race."
But adjusting was never an
issue for the Wolverines, who won
14 of the meet's 16 events and went
on to set two more pool records, in
the 200-yard medley and freestyle
relays.
Two Michigan swimmers won
two events each. Senior co-captain
Matt Patton won the 200-yard
freestyle and backstroke events

and freshman Dan Madwed won
the 100-yard backstroke and the
200-yard individual medley. For
the second straight meet, senior
co-captain Jamie Martone won
the 50-yard freestyle with a time
of 20.23.
The Wolverines also took the
top two spots in the one- and
three-meter diving events. Senior
Kyle Schroeder won both.
Because Michigan can bring
a limited number of athletes to
away meets, the Wolverines also
competed without some key swim-
mers. Sophomores Tyler Clary and
Neal Kennedy and juniors Alon
Mandel and Andr6 Schultz all vol-
unteered to practice in Ann Arbor
instead of competing in the meet.
Regardless of the easy victory,
Bottom acknowledged that he had
higher expectations for his team
in areas like the 200-yard butter-
fly and breaststroke events- the
only two that Michigan did not
finish first in.
"We did show a couple weak-
nesses," he said. "And we could
have swam faster in some areas,
but it's always good to come out
swim one of your rivals."
The Wolverines have three
weeks off before swimming in the
Big Ten Championships on Feb.
26-28.

Discus throwers
record tosses in
Kentucky's Nutter
Field House
By AMY SCARANO
Daily Sports Writer
It's no surprise that the throw-
ers on the Michigan women's track
and field team don't get any real
practice during the winter months
in Ann Arbor.
Instead, they practice their
form by throwing into a net in the
Indoor Track Building. But they
never know how far their throw
actually would have gone.
This weekend, at the Rod
McCravy Memorial in Lexington,
Kentucky, Michigan throwers
tried their arm with the discus -
and this time, there was no net.
Kentucky Nutter Field House
is big enough to host indoor dis-
cus throwing, and although discus
not an NCAA event during indoor
season, the meet provided good
practice for the start of the outdoor
season in March.
Sophomore Emily Pendleton
recorded the farthest throw in the

event (52.47 meters).
"We went down there to have
some fun and see what would hap-
pen," Pendleton said. "It was a
really relaxed atmosphere. I just
wanted to go out there and see
what I could do and give myself a
starting point."
In their upcoming home meet
on Feb. 21, the Wolverine throw-
ers are hoping to use the spacious
Oosterbaan Fieldhouse in asimilar
manner.
Meanwhile, Michigan's run-
ners won three events at the non-
scoring Meyo Invitational at Notre
Dame's Loftus Sports Center this
weekend.
Senior Geena Gall won the 500-
meter dash with an NCAA auto-
matic qualifying time (2:03.91).
Senior Tiffany Ofili, who did not
compete in the team's last meet at
Eastern Michigan on Jan. 30 and
31, won the 60-meter dash with a
time of 7.49 seconds:
And the Wolverines won the
distance medley relay in 11:10.23,
an NCAA provisional qualifying
time.
For now, the discus throwers
will continue practicing with the
net as they, and everyone else,
await warmer temperatures and
the outdoor season.

Wolve rines tird in CCHIA
after sweep of ake State

By CHRIS MESZAROS
DailySports Writer
Apparently, the Michigan hockey
fans have good foresight - because
they sure didn't miss much Satur-
day night.
In one LAKE SUPERIOR ST. 2
of the rare MICHIGAN 6
games
when the LAKE SUPERIOR ST. 1
student MICHIGAN 2
section
wasn't full, the Michigan hockey
team played one of its most boring
games of the season but still beat
Lake Superior State 2-1.
"It was an ugly win, but we got
through it," Michigan coach Red
Berenson said.
No. 4 Michigan (15-7-0-0 CCHA,
21-9-0 overall) started its sweep of
the Lakers by winning 6-2 Friday.
The Wolverines came into the game
needing a sweep to stay among the
top four teams in the CCHA, all of
whom receive a first-round. bye in
the opening round of the confer-
ence playoffs. Currently, the Wol-

verines sit alone in third place with
30 points, just two behind Miami
(Ohio) and six behind Notre Dame.
The Wolverines have six remain-
ingregular-seasongames before the
CCHA playoffs, against Nebraska-
Omaha, Ohio State and Ferris State.
The Buckeyes are currently fourth
in the conference with 28 points.
Nebraska-Omaha and Ferris State
have 26 and 23 points, respectively.
In both games this weekend, the
Lakers took a 1-0 lead in the first
period. And in both games, Michi-
gan goals at the end of the frame
swung the momentum, and the
game, to the Wolverines' side.
In Friday's game, sophomore
forward Matt Rust stole the puck in
the neutral zone and skated up the
side boards. Rust then flipped the
puck from backhand to forehand
and beat Lake Superior State goalie
Pat Inglis over his right shoulder.
To make matters worse for the
Lakers (6-10-6-1,9-13-8), Rust's goal
was shorthanded with just four sec-
onds remaining in the period.
"You have to be able to make the

reads here and there," Rust said.
"And I was one step ahead of the
defender and got lucky and was able
to pick up the puck. I have been try-
ing to keep my feet moving."
Though there were 40 minutes
left to play, the late goal sucked the
life out of the Lakers for the second
period.
And Michigan made them pay.
Including Rust's first goal, the
Wolverines scored five unanswered
tallies - before the Lakers lit the
lamp again.
After Lake Superior State
notched the opening goal Saturday,
Michigan answered again. Sopho-
more Carl Hagelin tied the game
with 28 seconds left in the first
frame on a wicked wrist shot from
the slot that beat Inglis on his glove
side.
Hagelin's tally Saturday was per-
haps the most important of the week-
end - not only because Michigan
won by just one goal but also because
the Lakers were prepared to play.
Inthe second period,juniorBrian
Lebler scored the game winner on

a rebound from a shot by sopho-
more Aaron Palushaj. The goal was
enough for Michigan to hold onto
the lead and sweep the series.
"That was a huge goal that
Hagelin got, kind of like Rust's
goal (Friday) night, to get us back
in the game in the first period,"
Berenson said. "And then we
scored on a rebound, and we hung
on for a one-goal game. It's hard
to beat a team twice in this league
back-to-back."
Lake Superior State missed sev-
eral late opportunities, including
a second-period opportunity off a
rebound. Senior Tim Miller was in
position to take the forward down,
and though he took a penalty, Mill-
er kept the Wolverines in the lead.
Hogan kept Michigan on top,
registering 26 saves and 45 on the
weekend.
"It was just one of those games
where we weren't in sync and we
just had to battle the whole way,"
Berenson said. "They were a tough
team, a good team. Bryan Hogan
had to make some big saves."

" 'M' ends regular season on a high note,
wins third straight dual on Senior Day

By FELIX CARREON
Daily Sports Writer
For three straight years, the
Michigan women's swimming and
diving team has ended the regular
season with a three-meet winning
streak.
The last two years, the Wolver-
ines also finished second at the Big
Ten Championships.
And they're well on their way to
doing that again.
The Wolverines won five of the
last six events on Saturday to sink
the Fighting Irish 141-102.
Senior Hannah Smith had a per-
formance to remember in her last
regular-season meet, winning the
200-yard freestyle (1:48.71) and
100-yard freestyle (50.27).
"It was Senior Day, so that was
in the back of my mind a little bit,"
Smith said. "Try to go -out with a
bang. I was pretty happy with how
I swam, especially with Big Tens in
a couple weeks in this building."
Michigan coach Jim Richardson
was very pleased with the strong
performances by the team's four
seniors, especially Smith.
AUERBACH
From page 1B
Michigan came out flat in the
opening frame of each game. The
Lakers dominated the game's pace,
scored first and applied constant
offensive pressure.
In both contests, a Wolverine
goal in the final minute of the first
period completely changed the
momentum.
But Michigan must learn it can't
wait and wait until someone steps
up in a crucial moment. It can't
always rely on a perfect backhand-
ed goal from its penalty-kill unit to
give the team a spark.
"I don't really know what it is,"
sophomore center Louie Capo-
russo said Friday. "(Other teams)
have strategies. We kind of adjust
as we go along. I think by the sec-
ond period, we have a feel for (the
game).... We've got to be ready at

ARIEL BOND/Daily
Senior Christine Nichols finished second in the 100-yard breaststroke Saturday.

"Coming out of the training trip,
we were a little tired, so every week
we have been getting a little bit more
rest, and at the meets, we build upon
that," Johnson said. "Our energy is
higher, our strokes are getting bet-
ter technically as we get stronger,
and our moods are better."
The diving events helped build
an insurmountable lead. Fresh-
man Amanda Lohman registered
career bests, finishing second in
the three-meter (298.35) and third
in the one-meter (291.60). Junior
Stephanie O'Callaghan also had
a strong performance with a sec-
ond-place finish in the one-meter
(293.03) and a third-place finish in
the three-meter (289.50).
Michigan will now welcome a
much needed-rest as they prepare
to host the Big Ten Championships
Feb. 18 - 21, where No. 10 Minne-
sota will be favored.
"Some people I thought would
be a little faster, and when I looked
up and saw Hannah's time in the
100, I thought, 'Where did that
come from?' "Richardson said.
"I'm not concerned. We've done
the work."

Junior Nikki Nemitz recorded two wins in the FAU Kick-Off Classic.

"I think it was important for
them," Richardson said. "I know it
was for Hannah Smith. She swam
lights out today. Anytime you're
here for four years and it's the last
one of something, you're thinking
about it a little bit more. I think all
of our seniors did a real nice job."
With Michigan trailing the Irish
59-53 halfway through the meet,
the Wolverines took over. Fresh-
man Caitlin Dauw won 100-yard
butterfly (55.57) to give Michigan
the lead for good.
Fifth-year senior Caroline Rodri-

guez extended the lead and earned
her first victory of the season in the
100-yard backstroke (56.64).
"Caroline has a lot of ability,"
Richardson said. "If she can ever
learn to harness that energy and
distribute it properly throughout
a race, she is going to be scary. We
are very fortunate to have her with
us now."
The Wolverines are swimming
faster after fully recovering from
a training camp a month ago and
using strong finishes to overpower
the competition.

the drop of the puck."
The trend of starting slowly
isn't new. The Wolverines have
given up the first goal in 14 of their
30 games thus far. Of those 14,
they've won just six.
To put that into perspective,
Michigan has lost just one game in
which it scored first.
Sure, this is a nitpicky problem.
If the team is winning even with
letdown periods or lapses on the
power play, it's still good, right?
Well, it was fine against a team
like Lake Superior State. But as
Notre Dame showed the Wolver-
ines, both last weekend and in
last April's Frozen Four game, it
doesn't work against good teams
or in the postseason.
I'm not saying that Michigan
has played poorly in recent weeks.
In fact, the third period against
the Fighting Irish two weekends
ago was probably one of the best
I've seen all season.

But through the first two
frames, the Wolverines were on
their heels, playing somewhat
lethargic hockey until their
dynamic comeback attempt.
Against the nation's top compe-
tition, that just won't cut it.
Still, this isn't a terrible problem
to have. For instance, when Miami
(Ohio) swept Michigan in Novem-
ber, the Wolverines found the back
of the net just once in six periods
- that's a serious issue.
This is just about preparing for
the postseason. Michigan wants a
top-four seed in the CCHA Tour-
nament, which would guarantee
a first-round bye and home-ice
advantage in the second round.
To earn that, the Wolverines
need toput together solid, 60-min-
ute efforts to beat middle-of-the-
pack foes like upcoming opponents
Nebraska-Omaha and Ferris State.
That starts with the first drop
of the puck.

"When we start playing the top-
notch teams in the league again,
like in the playoffs, it's going to
be a lot harder to come back in
games," Rust said Friday. "We're
not going to get the bounces I
did, lucky me being able to score
with (six) seconds left. We've got
to make a point-to just come out
stronger and harder and keep the
game simple."
And instead of just saying that,
the Wolverines need to do it.
Early-game offensive explosions
can't show up sporadically, like in
sweeps against rivals Michigan
State and Miami last month.
This team has shown it's more
than capable of competing with
the nation's best. But if it can put
together a complete game, Michi-
gan might just be able to knock
them out.

expression.
For the first time all game, one
of the Wolverines looked wild-
eyed, overwhelmed.
For everything they had done
right, for everything that had gone
their way, one measly missed lay-
up led to an 8-0 Connecticut run
and a10-point swing that tied the
game at 31.
Sure, Michigan kept it close
after that, but it was only a matter
of time before size and experience
stifled the proverbial man-beats-
giant storyline.
And Connecticut is a Goliath
- figuratively and, in a sense,
literally.
The Huskies are the top-ranked
team in the nation, and for good
reason after tearing off two
Il-game winningstreaks. Then
there's the 7-foot-3 behemoth
Hasheem Thabeet, who towers
over Michigan's "big" men, 6-foot-
8 DeShawn Sims and 6-foot-10
Zack Gibson.
The Huskies' game plan cen-
tered around Thabeet. And for
a team that's struggled mightily
against big men all season, Michi-
gan needed a perfect game to win
with Thabeet roaming the paint.
It was a nearly perfect game
before that gimme lay-up rimmed


out.
But from that play on, every
time the Wolverines made it close
and every time they appeared
to have a chance, Connecticut
stopped fooling around, stopped
giving up sloppyturnover and
simply tossed ally-oops to
Thabeet.
Every time Michigan had a
glimpse of hope, it was put back
in its place by the clearly superior
Huskies.
After the game, Connecticut
coach Jim Calhoun gave Michi-
gan quite high praise: "I hon-
estly think ina given game, they
can beat anybody in the United
States."
And the Wolverines have more
or less proven that, but not on a
consistent basis.
Heywood Broun once wrote of
a lesser boxer that had a shot -
but failed - at taking down Jack
Dempsey: "The tragedy of man
is not that he loses, but that he
almost wins."
Everyone remembers the story
of David taking down the power-
ful Goliath.
Butithe story's nutsa story if
David would have simply tripped
him up a bit. No glory is made in
losing - not matter how good the
team is or how close you came.

Redshirt sophomore Aaron Hynes kicked off Michigan's strong finish against Michigan State with a 9-7 win over Anthony Jones Jr. in the 157-pound class.
Blue continues hot streak

Grapplers now 4-0-1
in Big Ten after two
wins this weekend
By MICHAEL FLOREK
Daily Sports Writer
EAST LANSING - During the
Michigan wrestling team's pre-
match introductions against Michi-
gan State, Sparty tried to give a
good-natured fisthumptoMichigan
freshman Zac Stevens.
Spartyreceivednothinginreturn,
something that was common for the
Spartans all afternoon.
After coming from behind to
upset No. 8 Minnesota 17-16 Friday,
No. 18 Michigan demolished its in-
state rivals 28-7yesterday afternoon
in front of a crowd of 1,284.
The most excitingthing for many
of the members of Michigan's team
was wrestling on Michigan State's
raised platform, the only one in the
nation. The platform brings about a
sense that all eyes are on the wres-
tlers, and the noise that the platform
makes only enhances the experi-
ence.

"It's always fun to beat Michigan
State, especially in (Jenison Field
House)," senior Tyrel Todd said.
"They got the platform, they've got
a lot of great fans, so it is definitely
fun beating them here and doing it
in a dominating fashion."
The Wolverines fell behind 7-6
heading into the 157-pound match
featuring Michigan redshirt sopho-
more Aaron Hynes.
With Michigan State's Anthony
Jones Jr. holding a three-point
lead in the third period, the home
announcer told the crowd, "Jones is
dominating on his feet." Moments
later, Hynes scored a takedown and
converted that to a near fall, scor-
ing five points and taking the match
9-7.
After Hynes's victory, Michigan
went on to win the remaining five
matches.
"Nobody tells me that I'm the piv-
otal match," Hynes said. "They just
tell me to go out there and have fun,
and winning's fun."
Todd (197 pounds) carried the
momentum he gained two days
from his 16-5 victory over Minne-
sota junior Chris McPhail into his
bout against Michigan State fresh-

man Ian Hinton. After scoring a
takedown right away, he added an
exclamation point to the match by
scoring a pin just one minute and 41
seconds into the match.
"The Michigan State boy wasn't
real strong," Todd said. "I got on
top of him and was surprised at how
weak he felt, so I was like, 'I'm just
going to stick this guy right away."'
The two time All-American has
posted an 11-1 record since tearing
his ACL in early December.
"He's back," Michigan coach Joe
McFarland said. "I like the way he's
competing, he's in great shape....
He'll be there down the stretch. No
question about it."
Sophomore heavyweight Eddie
Phillips ended the meet with a
bout against his former high school
teammate and Spartan junior Alan
O'Donnell. Tied 1-1, the meet went
into overtime.
Phillips got into trouble early in
the extra period, but got out of it and
scored a takedown for a 3-1victory.
It was gratification for Phillips,
who lost to O'Donnell the last time
they met.
"Three years ago we were in high
school together, and there was no

way we would've ever thought we
would be wrestling on the Big Ten
Network," Phillips said. "That was
just something that was in the back
of my headthe whole time."
It was also the third overtime
match this year for Phillips. He
holds a 2-1 record in extra time.
"I believe I can beat anybody in
overtime, so I don't try to force bad
moves early in the match," Phillips
said.
After their two Big Ten wins this
weekend, the Wolverines' 4-0-1
record in conference play sharply
contrasts their 5-6 non-conference
record. With seven starting under-
classmen the young Wolverines
needed the non-conference season
to adjust to the rigors of collegiate
competition.
Michigan's turnaround needs to
continue in the final four conference
dual meets if it wants to match last
year's third-place Big Ten finish.
"We're working on little things
that we need to do better," McFar-
land said. "We're wrestling harder
through alot ofthese little positions.
We're ridingtough. We're not giving
our opponents anything, so that's
really good to see."

CAMERON
From page 1B
U.S. squad are chosen from the
National Team.
And Cameron did it without a
big score on the pommel horse, one
of his premier events.
The Wolverines thought Cam-
eron's pommel horse routine was
near-perfect, too. After two falls
on the first day of competition, the
sophomore nailed his set Saturday
night.
When the score came up as a
13.05, everyone thought it was a
mistake. Both his hit sets this sea-
son have earned 15.00 scores or
better.
"That was the biggest garbage
I've ever seen," senior co-captain
Phil Goldberg said. "Honestly, the"
first thing that popped into my
head was that this was a scoring
malfunction, they typed in the
wrong number or something."
But the score stood. And Cam-
eron's performances on his other
specialties - floor, rings and par-
allel bars"- and his ninth-place
all-around finish put him on the
National Team.
He thinks that in the next few
years, some of his Michigan team-
mates will eventually join him
there.
"You have to keep in mind that
(sophomore) Thomas Kelley is a
better gymnast than me, and so is
(junior) Mel (Santander)," Cam-
eron said. "They know they should
be on National Team with me, so I
think that's going to push them so
much more. It's amazing, the way
it's turned out. I'm sure it's going
to be the most positive thing that's
happened in a long time with the
program."
Cameron wasn't the only one
turning heads in Las Vegas.
HUSKIES
From page 1B
games, like in its 15-point loss at
Penn State on Jan. 20. The Spar-
tans are the best team in the Big
Ten, so if history says anything,
Michigan will come ready to play.
There's no doubtthat Michigan
coach John Beilein and his team
knew how important the game
was, but it took his team a little
while to get comfortable. The
Huskies' 7-foot-3 center Hasheem
Thabeet comically won the tip
with ease over 6-foot-10 Michi-
gan center Zack Gibson.
Connecticut started with a
quick 8-1 run in the first two min-
utes. But Gibson hita 3-pointer to
cut the lead to four, and from then
on, Michigan competed with the
nation's top-ranked team.
"We definitely looked at it as
an opportunity to get it one step
closer to where we want it to be,"
fifth-year senior C.J. Lee said.
"And we just didn't have enough
to pull out the victory."
Freshman Stu Douglass cer-
tainly gave his best effort. The
3-point specialist exploded from
long range, connecting on a
career-highsix3-pointers, includ-
ing a couple from well behind the
line. His 20 points were a career-
and game-high.
"He is asguy that notonly shoots
from three but can shoot from
(deep) range," Beilein said. "And
that is a huge thing for us. With-
out him tonight, it would have

been a 15- or 18-point game."
Despite being overmatched
athletically and physically, the
Wolverines (5-6 Big Ten, 15-9
overall) controlled the first 30
minutes after their shaky start

Goldberg placed third overall on
the still rings, edging out Cameron
to stand on the podium. Santander
bounced back from some rough
sets on Saturday with his second
outstanding pommel horse routine
in two days of competition to finish
fifth in the event. Fifth-year senior
Paul Woodwardcameinseventhon
the pommel horse. Kelley earned a
sixth-place tie on high bar.
"I think that this was one of the
best years that Michigan has had
at Winter Cup," said senior Ralph
Rosso, who finished 13th on rings.
"I think that we had some downs,
some falls, but we picked ourselves
back up and that's what's most
important."
As much as Cameron, Goldberg
was a star in Las Vegas. Unlike
most of his teammates, this was
Goldberg's first time competing in
a USA Gymnastics event. He said
he "lives for the big meets," and
that was especially apparent on
Saturday night.
The crowd, except for the sec-
tion of Michigan parents, didn't
make much noise for the Wolver-
ines. But Goldberg was the final
competitor on the still rings, and
after his routine, all the spectators
applauded him.
"It was perfect," Kelley said.
"We all think he won the meet. I
think his rings routine tonight was
by far the best in the competition.
He's going to win NCAA Champi-
onships if he can do a routine like
that again."
The Wolverines' overall per-
formance should go a long way in
boosting Michigan's national rep-
utation.
"We represented Michigan
real well," Goldberg said. "I think
it bodes well for the present and
also for the future, especially for
recruits, because we had a good
showing."
and nearly pulled off their biggest
win of the year.
Connecticut coach Jim Cal-
houn knew the matchup would be
difficult. The two coaches shared
the same sideline five times while
Beilein coached at West Virginia,
but Beilein was just 1-4 against
Calhoun.
"Coming home from Louisville
(where Connecticut won 68-51 on
Feb. 1), I said (to myself) 'What
did you do?' " Calhoun said of his
decision to schedule Michigan.
"You know it's going to he tortu-
ous. You know he's going to put
you through a root canal. And
sure as heck, they did."
The Huskies had trouble
adjusting to Michigan's defense,
which shifted from its traditional
1-3-1 zone to a new-look, 2-3 zone
throughout the game.
In the first half, Connecti-
cut (10-1 Big East, 221) shot just
11-for-30 from the field. The Hus-
kies missed plenty of easy buckets
inside, where they had a distinct
height advantage with Thabeet,
who had 17 points, 12 rebounds
and six blocks.
The Wolverines handled
Connecticut's full-court press
perfectly, committing just 10
turnovers while forcing 17. They
battled in the paint and even
knocked Thabeet out of the game
for a few minutes in the second
half. Gibson and Sims both used
their bodies to force Thabeet
and senior forward Jeff Adrien
into tough shots, and the Michi-

gan duo did all it could to keep
the Connecticut front line off the
boards.
Goinginto the game, Michigan,
a 17-point underdog, had nothing
to lose. But in the end, its "moral
victory" just felt empty.
