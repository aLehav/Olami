sophomore Samantha Kao and 
three other girls piled into a 
gray Volkswagen on a Saturday 
afternoon in the fall. These 
strangers were making their way 
to the grocery store.
In order to fill their pantries, 
University of Michigan students 
living off campus have created 
grocery 
carpool 
trips 
and 
discovered 
food 
distribution 
resources from Facebook pages 
and 
student 
organizations. 
Besides 
these 
student-run 
methods, if someone does not 
have 
transportation, 
finding 
affordable and nutritious food on 

campus can be difficult. 
It is Kao’s first year in off-
campus housing, and she was not 
aware of the many obstacles that 
stand in the way of a student’s 
access to food. She was concerned 
about the time, money and 
distance that play a role in getting 
food in Ann Arbor. For students 
living in off campus housing, an 
unlimited meal plan is $2,265 
per term. 
“I’d like to think that there are 
resources out there, but I’ve found 
that there are very few. Living off 
campus by yourself is a big change, 
and having the time to prepare 
food on your own is a concern that 
my friends and I have,” Kao said. 

Referencing Muslim wrestler 
Khabib 
Nurmagomedov’s 
performance 
in 
an 
Ultimate 
Fighting Championship match 
the night before, Dawud Walid 
asked 
Sakinah 
Rahman, 
a 
Muslim college student wearing 
a long, loose black dress paired 
with a colorful headscarf, why 
she dressed so conservatively in 
comparison.
“That Khabib guy, he was out 
there last night wearing those 
short-shorts. Why do you look all 
oppressed, covered up and all?”
However, 
Walid’s 
question 
had no malicious intent. In fact, 
Walid is the executive director of 
Michigan’s chapter of the Council 
on American-Islamic Relations, a 
civil rights and advocacy group.
The question was part of an 
exercise that sought to teach 
young Muslims how to speak 
about Islam and in some cases 
answer contentious questions.
The University of Michigan 
organized 
the 
event, 
titled 
“Presenting 
Islam 
to 
Fellow 
Americans,” in hopes it would 
give young Muslims the tools to 
articulate answers to questions 
about their faith.
The training featured three 
sessions: Haaris Ahmad, the 
CAIR-Michigan board president, 
led the first one on body language; 
Asha Noor, the CAIR-Michigan 
programming 
and 
outreach 
director, led the second one on 
conflict-resolution; and Walid led 

third on answering frequently 
asked questions.
Ahmad said the workshop 
is relevant in today’s political 
climate where many Americans 
have questions about Muslims 
and Islam.
“Obviously people are being 
called upon to explain their faith, 
to explain their experience, to 
unfortunately have to comment 
on world events even as young 
college students, young teens, 

when they would not have been 
asked about these things in the 
past,” Ahmad said. “That’s why a 
training of this sort, or this type of 
session, is needed.”
As a Muslim woman who 
wears a headscarf, Rahman said 
she is constantly asked questions, 
ranging from gender equality 
to daily prayer to terrorism. She 
believes this workshop equipped 
her with the skills needed to 
articulate her beliefs.

“For me, because I choose 
to cover, people are just always 
asking questions,” Rahman said. 
“I’m always put in a position to 
where I’m not so qualified to 
answer this question, but I’m their 
only source right now. Because 
if it’s not going to be me, they’ll 
find websites that’ll give them 
false information or they’ll ask 

The University of Michigan’s 
Law School and Ford School of 
Public Policy hosted a discussion 
Friday on the ties between sports 
and politics. The event, titled 
“Activism and Sports”, analyzed 
the 
misinformation 
regarding 
protests at sporting events. The 
event was part of the Critical Race 
Theory Brown Bag Lunch Series 
that examines current policy and 
social issues in the United States.
Law professor Sherman J. 
Clark began the conversation 
with a question: “Why do so 
many people so often seem to 
misunderstand or mischaracterize 
the purpose or point of protests?” 
Clark then explained why 
sports have significant social 
capital 
in 
activism, 
arguing 
against the separation of sports 
and politics.
“Sports have social salience and 
communicative impact whether 
you want them to or not,” Clark 
said. “The fact is, sports are 
entertainment, yeah, but they are 
not merely entertainment.”

Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed Saturday shifting the court’s ideological balance right

Following weeks of protests, 
rallies and hearings regarding 
allegations of past sexual assault 
Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed 
Saturday to the U.S. Supreme 
Court. His confirmation was 

by one of the closest margins 
in American history, and his 
status as Supreme Court justice 
solidifies a conservative majority 
on the court Saturday.
Senators voted 50 to 48 nearly 
along party lines — Sen. Joe 
Manchin III, D-W.Va., was the 
only Democrat to vote “yes” and 
Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Ala., was 

the only Republican who stated 
she would vote “no,” but withdrew 
her vote in response to Sen. Steve 
Daines, R-Mont., who was not 
present but would have voted 
“yes.” During the vote, protests 
could be heard from the Senate 
floor, with chants of “shame” and 
“I do not consent” ringing from 
the viewing galleries after votes 

were called. 
When four key swing state 
senators, including Republican 
Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Jeff 
Flake of Arizona, and Murkowski 
as well as Manchin, officially 
announced their positions on 
Kavanaugh prior to the final vote, 
many agreed confirmation was

Batteries have always fascinated 
LSA junior Nando Felten. Felten, 
who is from Detroit but spent 
most of his life living in Germany, 
was amazed by the universal use 
of batteries. But what surprised 
Felton even more was that the 
current model for the battery has 
remained largely unchanged for 
the last several decades.
Now, a research assistant in 
the 
Undergraduate 
Research 
Opportunity 
Program 
with 
plans to transfer to the College of 
Engineering, Felten is on a mission 
to build a better battery model.
“Batteries can be found all 
around the world,” Felten said. 
“Batteries today continue to be one 
of the most fundamental pieces of 
almost all electric power or electric 
equipment 
or 
devices 
today. 
Batteries today, there hasn’t really 
been a revolutionary change.”

inevitable. For Public Policy 
junior Katie Kelly, who serves 
as the communications director 
of the University of Michigan’s 
chapter of College Democrats, 
the decisions of Collins, Flake 
and Manchin to vote “yes” 

ignited 
feelings 
of 
anger and frustration. 
“It’s really, really frustrating 
because no matter how many 
times you call these Senators 
or how often you protest or 
stand up it seems like our cries 
fall on deaf ears,” Kelly said. “It 
made me hopeful when I heard 
Jeff Flake come out during the 
hearings calling for an FBI 
investigation because it seemed 

as though maybe it wasn’t going 
to be a completely partisan issue, 
that maybe there was a chance 
some people would see common 
sense on this … and then he just 
came right back and completely 
voted along party lines and 
really disappointed those who 
became hopeful during the FBI 
investigation … After Susan 
Collins came out and said she 
was voting yes that was really 
one of the final nails in the 
coffin for me.”
LSA sophomore Dylan 
Berger, president of the 
University’s 
chapter 
of 
College 
Republicans, 
argued support for swing 
state senators, particularly 
Collin 
and 
Manchin, 
who voted in favor of 
Kavanaugh.
“I think both Senators 
were 
wise 
to 
vote 
to 
confirm 
Kavanaugh,” 
Berger wrote in an email. 
“I thought Senator Collins 
gave a speech on the Senate 
floor for the ages. She 
represented the institution 
of the Senate well by 
making a decision based on 
the facts, not mob hysteria. 
Americans 
of 
future 
generations will thank her 
for preserving due process 
in the face of angry mobs of 
protestors.”
Leading 
up 
to 
Kavanaugh’s confirmation, 
the University community 
held 
several 
protests 
following the allegations of 
sexual assault by Christine 

Blasey Ford, a professor at 
Palo Alto University who in 
September 
publicly 
shared 
details regarding Kavanaugh’s 
alleged 
attempt 
of 
sexual 
assault when the two were 
in high school. Ford is one 
of three women to publicly 
accuse Kavanaugh of assault or 
misconduct.
In 
a 
confidential 
letter 
Ford sent months ago to Sen. 
Dianne 
Feinstein, 
D-Calif., 
but 
publicly 
released 
in 
September by Senate Judiciary 
Committee Chairman Charles 
Grassley, R-Iowa, Ford writes 
about the high school incident. 
She states Kavanaugh pushed 
her into a bedroom while at a 
gathering in a Maryland home, 
got on top of her, attempted to 
remove her clothing and put 
his hand over her mouth when 
she tried to yell for help.
In 
response 
to 
these 
developments 
in 
the 
Kavanaugh hearings, the Law 
School held a panel during 
the final week of September 
with Law professors Kate 
Andrias, Barbara McQuade 
and Margo Schlanger on the 
campus implications of the 
sexual 
assault 
allegations 
against Kavanaugh. Following 
the panel, the Law School 
community 
organized 
a 
rally titled “Respect Women, 
Respect Survivors and Respect 
the Court.” Last week, another 
rally to protest Kavanaugh

If students shouting about 
voter registration on the Diag 
aren’t 
convincing 
enough, 
the Michigan Secretary of 
State office has devised a new 
way to assist with student 
registration.
On Monday, the Michigan 
Secretary of State will host 
a mobile voter registration 
unit at the Michigan League 
circle 
drive. 
The 
mobile 

unit will mainly serve voter 
registration but is still open 
to other Secretary of State 
services.
The 
Secretary 
of 
State 
office asks those registering 
to vote to bring a driver’s 
license or Michigan state 
identification. The deadline 
to register to vote is Tuesday 
at 5 p.m.
The mobile unit is part of 

the University of Michigan’s 
efforts to win the Big 10 
Voting 
Challenge. 
The 
challenge 
encourages 
Big 
10 schools to get as many 
students to register and vote 
after historically low voter 
turnout among young adults.
The Big 10 Voting Challenge 
will have two awards: one for 
the institution that yields 
the 
highest 
percentage 

of 
registered 
voters 
and 
one for best overall voter 
improvement.
The 
University 
is 
also 
partnered with Turbovote, 
an online tool that helps U-M 
students, faculty and staff 
register to vote.
Mid-term 
elections 
are 
 
Nov. 6.

*This review includes spoilers*
My favorite romance movie? 
The one during which the girl 
dumps the guy at the end and 
walks off into the sunset fulfilled 
with the knowledge that she is 
enough and doesn’t need a man.
“Queen” is my favorite not-so-
typical Bollywood movie. This 
movie 
shattered 
stereotypes 
and launched a new era in Hindi 
cinema. Of course, some of the 
credit for successful women-
oriented Hindi films goes to my 
fav, Priyanka Chopra, for her 
iconic role in “Fashion” (a project 
of which actress Kangana Ranaut 
was also a part), but “Queen” was 
the movie that did extremely well 
at the box office and put Ranaut 
on the map. Ranaut has gone on 
to fearlessly call out nepotism 
and sexism in the industry ever 
since.
“Queen” tells the story of Rani, 
a woman whose fiancé leaves her 
days before their wedding. Despite 
her heartbreak, Rani decides to go 
on her honeymoon alone and ends 
up on a whirlwind journey of self-
discovery and growth. This movie 
shattered stereotypes about desi 
women and what the trajectory of 
our lives should be.
“Queen” is also the least 
problematic Bollywood movie I’ve 
ever seen. This in itself is quite 
an accomplishment, considering 
the industry we’re talking about. 
Yet, there were still elements of 
this movie that bothered me — 
the tiny details that perpetuate 

stereotypes despite the fact that 
the director could have easily 
made 
different 
choices 
that 
wouldn’t be harmful.
First, there is a moment in the 
film when Rani is approached by a 
stranger who is trying to help her. 
Rani doesn’t know this and all she 
sees is a Black man standing near 
her and she screams in terror. 
It’s a rational reaction for her to 
be frightened in the context of 
the movie, but it was absolutely 
unnecessary for the director to 
choose the only Black character in 

the film to be the one who scares 
her. The image of Black men 
in India is permeated with the 
harmful stereotypes we see in U.S. 
media and accentuated by the fact 
that most Indians have never even 
met a Black person. Furthermore, 
Tim, the only Black character in 
the movie, has the least lines and 
isn’t given a backstory.
The last scenes of the movie 
are some of the best, especially 
the combination of the music 
and aesthetics. However, these 

are the only scenes of the movie 
where Rani’s hair is straightened. 
Throughout most of the film, Rani 
wears her hair naturally curly, 
and as a curly-hair girl myself, this 
is one of the many reasons I loved 
her character so much. However, 
the final scenes, when Rani is 
portrayed as her most badass and 
confident self, her hair is straight. 
This sends the subtle message that 
straight hair is more beautiful and 
somehow more closely associated 
with feeling empowered.
The most typical Bollywood 
element of this movie is the 
flashback showing how Rani 
and her fiancé Vijay fell in love 
— Vijay essentially stalked her 
until she finally agreed to have 
dinner with him. This is how 
most Bollywood movies go — 
women are pursued until they 
finally “wear down” and “agree.” 
In fact, sexual harassment and 
assault in Bollywood isn’t just 
limited to what we see on-screen. 
The industry itself is also rife with 
instances of well-known actors 
taking advantage of actresses. 
“Queen” was refreshing because 
Rani doesn’t end up with the 
stalker at the end.
Since 
I 
first 
watched 
it, 
“Queen” has become one of my 
favorite Bollywood films. Though 
there are details that I find 
troubling, the beauty in seeing a 
main character who is strong in 
her convictions and unwavered by 
society’s expectations is hard to 
measure. A movie like this is rare 
in mainstream Bollywood, but it’s 
exactly the kind of high-quality 
cinema I want to see.

Interracial 
relationships 
haven’t been something accepted 
in America for a long time at all. It 
was only legalized about 50 years 
ago with the landmark Loving 
v. Virginia Supreme Court case, 
during which a Black woman and 
a white man took their wedding 
vows in Washington, D.C., but 
then moved to Virginia, a state 
that banned interracial marriage.
Due to this law, the couple 
was indicted by a grand jury four 
months into the marriage, and 
they were forced to move back to 
the place where they had taken 
their vows to avoid another year of 
imprisonment. Luckily, when the 
couple appealed to the Supreme 
Court, the case overturned the 

conviction and struck down the 
law in Virginia.
Fifty years ago is not that 
long ago. There are people still 
alive who very well remember 
interracial marriage illegalization. 
However, that being said, there 
has still been progress with the 
general public’s perception of 
interracial couples. Well, most 
interracial couples.
The media has played a big 
role in this with movies like 
“The Big Sick”, “The Incredible 
Jessica James” and even the 
newest heartwarming romantic 
comedy “To All The Boys I’ve 
Loved Before”. TV shows like 
“The Flash”, “Scandal” and “How 
To Get Away with Murder” have 
also featured interracial couples as 
main plot points. However, do you 
notice a pattern with these forms 
of media?

These are all some of the most 
popular movies and TV shows, 
yet all feature a person of color 
and a white person. It’s never two 
interracial people of color who 
come together. In fact, there seems 
to be more positive representation 
in mainstream pop culture of a 
white person with a person of color 
than even two people of color from 
the same background together!
To give one example of many, 
Aziz Ansari got our hopes up in 
the first episode of the second 
season of “Master of None” when 
he found a Black woman he 
was romantically interested in. 
However, he lost his phone and as 
a result communication with her 
forever. Of course, he proceeded 
to fall in love with a white Italian 
woman, and not without the 
periodic flux of interest and 
disinterest in the South Asian 

woman who appeared within the 
season.
There’s always an edge of fear 
and controversy of calling this out. 
Interracial couples and friendships 
that are a white person and a 
person of color aren’t negative 

by any means, and calling this 
disparity out doesn’t imply they 
are bad in any way. They should 
still be encouraged — it’s just that 
there needs to be more romantic 
and even platonic representation 
of what two different non-white 

cultures 
look 
like 
together. 
Hollywood 
has 
been 
making 
great strides in diversity lately, 
but as with any institution mainly 
founded by people with privileged 
identities, there is unsurprisingly 
always room for improvement.

When I was 11 years old, I 
decided to wear a headscarf. I 
knew I would eventually wear 
one because as a Muslim, I believe 
it’s required of me. While others 
don’t, it all depends on people’s 
personal beliefs. My close friends 
wore one, and so did my mom, so 
it seemed like the appropriate time 
to take the plunge. When I told my 
mom I wanted to wear a scarf, she 
took me out to buy headscarves for 
girls my age. Before I knew it, the 
day came when I chose to wear 
one in public for the first time. It 
was pretty anticlimactic. My mom 
was going to the grocery store, so 
I wore a cardigan as I normally 
would, and put on my headscarf. 
I remember walking out the door, 
self-conscious, because it was the 
first time I went out in a scarf and 
I thought those who knew me 
would stare. But nobody did. It 
was just like any other day.
I should clarify, however, that 
I’m from Dearborn, Michigan. 
Dearborn is home to the largest 
population of people of Middle 
Eastern origin in the United 
States and has a large Muslim 
population. So, my wearing a 
scarf was completely normal, as 
many other girls and women in 
Dearborn wear headscarves. I also 
didn’t feel any different on my first 
day of sixth grade, which was the 
first time I wore a scarf to school.

The only time I did feel weird 
was when I went outside of 
Dearborn. People from Dearborn 
refer to this phenomenon of the 
“Dearborn bubble,” because it’s 
like we live in our own protective 
shell and I’m starting to realize 
the truth of it. When I went to 
Twelve Oaks Mall in Novi for the 
first time, which is only 35 minutes 
away, I remember feeling people 
stare at me. I don’t know if this 
was because I was self-conscious 
because 
there 
weren’t 
many 
Muslims around, or because it 
actually happened. As I’ve grown 
older, however, I’ve learned not to 
let people’s staring bother me.
But my headscarf wasn’t the 
only thing that made me feel 
different from others. While I 
may look different from many 
Americans, I’m still an American. 
On a family trip to Lebanon, I 
realized how different my sisters 
and I were from my cousins. They 
always refer to us as Americans, 
because we don’t entirely fit into 
their culture. We prefer English 
music to their Arabic music, and 
we have distinct fashion tastes. 
Even the way they style their 
headscarves is different than how 
I style mine.
Still, when I come back home, 
some Americans don’t think I’m 
American. In fact, I was once 
walking to class when I heard 
two voices behind me talking 
about how many Arabs (people of 
Middle Eastern origin) are boaters 
(derogatory term for immigrant) 

and don’t understand English. 
I wanted to tell them English is 
my first language and I was born 
here. But either out of fear or not 
wanting to give them the pleasure 
of provoking me, I just kept on 
walking.
I have never felt like I really fit 
in anywhere except Dearborn, 
where I’m still judged by others, 
but so is everyone else. Yet we’ve 
somehow created a culture of our 
own — a part of the old country 
and part of our own country. I 
don’t feel like a true Lebanese 
when I visit Lebanon, and I feel 
different than some Americans in 
America. But I’m just like many 
people from Dearborn, the child 
of immigrants. I hope I find that 
same sense of belonging in Ann 
Arbor, where I’ve come to realize 
people differ in many ways, not 
only in their backgrounds. At the 
University of Michigan, people 
can be whoever they want to 
be, without facing judgement 
as harshly as they might face it 
somewhere else. I’ve found I can 
be myself and be welcomed by 
inclusive communities here on 
campus, such as PILOT. PILOT 
is a student-run organization 
that works to empower and 
make leaders of students from 
underrepresented 
minorities 
on campus. This organization 
welcomes each of its members like 
family, which is truly an amazing 
thing. Inclusive environments like 
PILOT here at Michigan, makes 
me glad to say I’m a Wolverine.

Who has the right to say the 
word nigger? 
Not nigga, with an a, but nigger. 
Hard r.
If you’re Black, at this point 
into the article you’re probably 
enraged 
this 
word 
is 
being 
published in a news article. If 
you’re white, you’re probably just 
plain uncomfortable. You can 
rest assured though, because the 
writer of this article is also Black, 
which makes this okay. Or does it?
The word nigger is taboo. Even 
just typing the word makes me 
uncomfortable. Why? Partially 
because it’s a traumatic term 
that encompasses years of brutal 
history Black people faced at the 
hands of their oppressors. Because 
it’s ugly and holds too much pain. 
Also 
because 
it’s 
practically 
forbidden. Arguably it’s one of the 
most avoided words in our English 
vocabulary, censored before you 
have a chance to understand what 
someone’s trying to say. But does 

censoring it protect us from the 
harsh triggers of the word or just 
gloss over a history that can never 
be erased?
I typically hold the belief that 
if you’re not Black, you shouldn’t 
say it. Ever. But recently I’ve 
questioned this after discussing 
the use of the word — and if it’s 
okay for non-Black people to say it 
in plays and productions — in one 
of my classes. I wanted to discuss 
my personal opinion on it, which 
was a bit hard to do as I was the 
only Black person in the class that 
day. This blurred the line between 
having a fruitful conversation 
and taking the role of “educating” 
the other white students in my 
class, as all the white students 
would inevitably look to me as the 
definite stance of who deserves to 
say the word.
Besides obvious reasons of not 
having to be a spokesperson for 
my race, I could not provide an 
answer. Even among Black people 
it’s not clear who deserves to say 
that word. I personally think it’s 
okay for Black people to say nigger 
and nigga because I see it as a 

form of reclaiming a word that 
was used against them for so long, 
taking the power away from it by 
making it their own. This follows 
same way women have reclaimed 
the word “pussy” and “bitch.”

But is it exactly the same 
thing? Because the words “pussy” 
and “bitch” don’t have the same 
cultural significance as the word 
“nigger.” And I’m not saying 
this to rank the pain caused by 
different words as that argument 
is virtually pointless, but it’s still 
important to note pain is different.

A lot of Black people believe 
the word deserves to die because 
of the amount of pain it’s caused 
and probably also believe it’s past 
the point of reclaiming. In 2007, 
the NAACP held a “funeral for 
the n-word” to lay it to rest and 
prevent it from doing any more 
harm. Something important to 
note is the coffin carried during 
the funeral though had the word 
“nigga” on the side, not the word 
“nigger.” Nigga is the reclaimed, 
now colloquial form of the word 
used casually among Black people 
and in their music. The word 
nigger, however, was the actual 
contemptuous word used by white 
people in the past. But does laying 
the word down to rest actually 
pave the way for a future without 
hate or racial slurs? Or does it even 
placate all of those who have been 
traumatized by that word for ages? 
One good point made by Jordan 
Cooper is even if the n-word is laid 
to rest, “They’ll (white people) just 
come up with other words — like 
‘thug.’”
Al Sharpton once said, “If you 
call yourself the n-word, you 

can’t get mad when someone 
treats you like that.” This brings 
into question the idea of what 
Black people are saying to white 
people on how they should be 
treated if they call themselves 
that word. In my opinion, white 
people shouldn’t be looking to 
Black people on how to treat Black 
people anyway. If they’re curious 
then they should just ask us. 
Also, because white people aren’t 
Black, they definitely should not 
be treating Black people the same 
way other Black people do. But 
that’s a whole other conversation 
on appropriation of culture.
The discussion on who has the 
right to say nigger is something 
that will undoubtedly carry on for 
a while. Within Black people it’s 
more of a personal choice on who 
can say it. Even I, as a Black person, 
feel hesitant on whether I have the 
“right to say it.” Yes, I am Black 
but I’m also a first-generation 
Nigerian. My ancestors did not 
share the same history as Black 
people here whose ancestors went 
through slavery. It might not even 
be my word to reclaim and I’m 

profiting off my privilege as an 
African-Black person that allows 
me to say this word with which I 
don’t share the same history.
But though I don’t share the 
same history as my Black brethren 
across the diaspora, I still feel the 
same pain living as a Black person 
in America, in a world that wasn’t 
built for me and is so eager to 
bring me down. In a world Where 
a police officer could take the 
life of my brother, cousin, father 
and it wouldn’t matter if they’re 
Nigerian or “African-American” 
Black. In a world where I get 
called that word on school trips 
for laughing too loudly with my 
friends.
Regardless of this, it’s still a 
personal choice among all Black 
people of who can say it, not 
something on which we might not 
come to a consensus. At least not 
anytime soon.
Despite the significance of 
this word though, at the end of 
the day this unfortunately might 
just become another battle in 
linguistics. But one that no one is 
willing to have.

“

Bless this house, for we are 
all together. Bless us all, we 
may not meet again.”
If you and I are friends, there 
is no reason for you to read this 
column. Actually, if you’ve only 
met me in passing, you can move 
on, too. Basically, if you’ve ever 
spent more than five minutes with 
me you have heard more about 
the topic of this column than you 
had ever cared to hear, and I don’t 
want to put you through more 
than you can handle. That’s right 
folks, this column is all about the 
thing I never shut up about: camp.
For those of you who may be 
confused, I spent 10 summers at 
Camp Wise, a Jewish overnight 
camp in Chardon, Ohio. Yes, 
that’s 10 summers, or half the 
summers of my life spent at 
what can fairly be described as 
a cult, inspiring a level of rabid 
fanaticism about camp that can 
only be understood by those who 
were right there with me.
Camp 
isn’t 
for 
everyone, 
but if it is for you, it is the most 
wonderful experience of your 
life. Camp is singing and dancing 
for no reason and dressing in 
dumb costumes for the day just 
because you can. It’s making up 
interpretive dances to Disney 
songs, writing and performing 
recurring skits about deadly 
beans, and waking your friends 
up at midnight to force feed 
them Animal Crackers and dress 
them in adult diapers (an actual 
thing I did at camp, the context is 
unimportant).
I am a worrier by nature. 
I stress about school, life and 
relationships. I hate being with 
loud groups in public and I 
always follow the rules. But at 
camp, rules just aren’t the same 
as they are everywhere else. The 
weight on my shoulders, where 
all of those slightly neurotic 
concerns normally live, is lifted. 
Each summer since I was seven 
years old I was liberated from 
my self-imposed restraints, and 
I was a better version of myself 
on camp grounds than I could 
be anywhere else. I could be 
silly and adventurous and find 
the fun in every situation. It 
was just a month of my year, but 
every summer the campers, staff 
and place came together like a 
transient piece of theatre. One 

moment it was there, beautiful 
and outsized and poignant, and 
then it was gone, avoiding capture 
until the next summer solstice.
I always felt a sense of 
mourning when I had to leave 
camp and return to the real 
world, because I had to say 
goodbye to this person I loved 
being. I began this column with 
a lyric from the very last song we 
sing on the last night of camp. We 
gather in a circle with our cabin, 
looking at the faces of those 
we have come to love, and sing 
about how we may never see one 
another again. I would tear up in 
the dark, thinking of leaving and 
being so far away from my friends 
and, especially, my better self.

In this semester’s column, 
I am looking back to revisit 
the different people I have 
been throughout my life. I am 
separated from them by swaths 
of time, making them feel like 
historical 
figures. 
They 
are 
unreachable and unrecoverable, 
but there is a great deal to be 
learned from them. However, the 
person I am at camp is not frozen 
in time, 10 years back. She exists 
just three hours from here. She 
has a geographical home, not a 
chronological one, and for that 
reason it has been all the more 
difficult to say goodbye to her as 
I choose to spend my summers 
elsewhere. With every internship 
or study abroad application, I feel 
as though I am cutting ties with 
the best version of myself.
I do get glimpses of her, 
though, in my everyday life. 
She appears when I’m at a party 
and not having fun, and then 
“Everytime We Touch” comes 
on, and I break into the floor-
shaking crazy person dancing 
who is perfectly normal during 

Saturday dance parties at camp. 
She appears when a joke is so 
funny I forget how loud my 
laugh is, or when a friend is 
upset and instinct pulls me into 
energetic camp counselor mode 
to cheer them up, or when a 
little enthusiasm sneaks into the 
library and breaks up a boring 
night of studying.
The pang of grief I felt each 
year singing “Bless This House” 
on the last night of camp was 
always mitigated by the thought 
of coming back the next summer 
and picking up right where I left 
off, reclaiming my silly, carefree 
other self; now, though, I don’t 
know if I will ever go back. For 
10 summers I unwittingly sang 
along to Joni Mitchell’s “The 
Circle Game,” a camp favorite, 
at song sessions, and I so wish I 
had heeded her advice, “We’re 
captive on the carousel of time … 
take your time. It won’t be long 
now until you drag your feet to 
slow the circles down.”
Life moves on, despite our 
best efforts to delay it. I find 
myself asking how I can justify 
leaving behind this version of 
myself I love so much. I realized 
the answer to that question 
was divulged to me each year 
in that midnight cabin circle, 
tucked away in the lyrics of that 
melancholy tune: “Think of all 
the happiness we’ve found here, 
take it home and share it with a 
friend.”
We all have best versions 
of ourselves, though they may 
at times feel elusive or distant. 
But as long as I capture the 
happiness and freedom I found 
at camp, storing it carefully for 
safekeeping, I will always be 
capable of being my best self. 
When I smile wide and forget 
about the rules for a moment 
or two, I will know that my 
camp self is stepping out. So, 
unfortunately for my friends, I 
won’t stop talking about camp 
anytime soon, even as I spend 
more and more time away from 
Chardon, Ohio. In fact, there’s 
someone really wonderful I met 
there, and I’d like to introduce 
you.

Learning a thing or two from Patagonia
E

arly last week, nearly 
150 companies launched 
a 
collective 
campaign 
to 
increase 
voter 
turnout 
in 
the 
upcoming 
midterm 
elections. The effort, 
known as Time to 
Vote, is backed by 
some of the largest 
U.S. 
companies, 
including 
Walmart, 
Dick’s 
Sporting 
Goods and Levi’s.
According 
to 
a 
Pew Research Center 
study after the 2014 midterm 
elections, a plurality of eligible 
voters couldn’t find the time to 
vote, citing that work or school 
made it difficult. Because less 
than half of of the eligible 
population voted in the last 
midterm elections, companies 
decided to come together to give 
their employees (along with the 
general public) an opportunity to 
vote Nov. 6.
Levi’s, the company known 
for its quality jeans, is giving its 
corporate employees five hours 
and its retail employees three 
hours to vote on Election Day. 
Lyft chose to participate in the 
effort by giving its customers 
discounted 
rides 
to 
polling 
places. The ride-sharing app 
is also planning on providing 
free rides to people in the most 
underprivileged neighborhoods.
The company taking the 
boldest action to further improve 
voter turnout is Patagonia, which 
has committed to completely 
shutting down its corporate 
headquarters and all of its retail 
stores on Election Day.
Patagonia 
CEO 
Rose 
Marcario 
underscored 
the 
importance of getting people 
to vote, asserting “a vibrant 
democracy relies on engaged 
citizens voting” and “business 
can play a vital role by removing 
barriers.”
While the companies claim 
the effort is nonpartisan, their 
rationale 
is 
quite 
obvious 

given the decisive nature of 
this election season. Patagonia 
in particular has voiced its 
strong 
disapproval 
for 
the 
current 
administration.
When 
President 
Donald 
Trump 
abandoned 
the 
2015 Paris Climate 
Accord, 
Patagonia 
was one of hundreds 
of 
companies 
to 
condemn 
his 
decision. In addition, 
the company filed a 
lawsuit last year against Trump, 
Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke 
and other Trump administration 
officials. The company, along 
with several other parties, chose 
to fight the president’s decision 
to reduce the extent of two 
national monuments in Utah – 
Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-
Escalante – to less than half 
their original size.
Since its founding in 1973 by 
Yvon Chouinard, Patagonia has 
been unapologetically political. 
The company has devoted itself 
to positively impacting society—
particularly 
in 
regard 
to 
environmental stewardship. The 
company is well known for its 
corporate social responsibility 
efforts, which include its pledge 
to give 1 percent of its revenue 
to 
grassroots 
environmental 
organizations every year.
Beyond 
simply 
donating 
money, the company has proven 
to 
be 
radically 
transparent 
in regard to its production 
processes. On the company’s 
website, you can find “The 
Footprint 
Chronicles,” 
 
an 
interactive map that catalogues 
the 
complete 
environmental 
impact of its products. You 
can see the entire production 
process – from the farm to the 
mill to the factory. Patagonia 
continues 
its 
devotion 
to 
maintaining 
sustainable 
production processes with its 
selling of second-hand products 
on its website. The company 

also 
recycles 
products 
for 
customers when they’re no 
longer wearable.
With its commitment to 
corporate social responsibility 
and its astounding level of 
transparency, 
Patagonia 
has 
surely fulfilled its mission to 
“use business to inspire and 
implement 
solutions 
to 
the 
environmental crisis.” 
While Patagonia may appear 
to function like a nonprofit, 
which 
would 
prioritize 
environmental 
sustainability 
over profits, the company has 
achieved impressive financial 
results over the years. The 
company rakes in hundreds of 
millions of dollars in revenue 
per year – making Chouinard a 
billionaire. It’s clear Patagonia’s 
commitment to environmental 
preservation 
has 
attracted 
a substantial (and growing) 
consumer 
base 
that 
values 
companies with a conscience.
Patagonia 
isn’t 
the 
only 
company that can achieve such 
favorable results. Private sector 
entities have been (and should 
be) involving themselves in the 
public sphere. In a piece for The 
New York Times, David Gelles 
writes of a survey’s results 
comprising more than 1,000 
Americans’ thoughts regarding 
CEO involvement in the public 
sector. He states more than 33 
percent of survey respondents 
view it favorably and almost 50 
percent believe CEO activism 
can 
influence 
government 
policy.
The private sector can learn 
a lot from Patagonia and a slew 
of other companies that are 
working to change the world. 
Society could benefit immensely 
from 
the 
private 
sector 
committing itself to furthering 
socially beneficial goals – goals 
that go beyond just maximizing 
shareholder value.

Brett Kavanaugh and the year of the woman

W

hat 
is 
appropriate 
etiquette when invited 
to a local home for 
dinner in a foreign country? This 
question was the source of much 
anxiety during my recent trip to 
Kenya, as part of the C.K. Prahalad 
Fellowship at the Ross School of 
Business. Although I had previously 
lived in Kenya before returning to 
business school, this was a question 
that I never fully grasped the 
answer to. Growing up in the United 
States, it was not typically expected 
that you should bring a gift when 
visiting a friend. If invited to dinner, 
you may be asked to bring a dish to 
pass or provide desert, though it is 
by no means expected. However, 
U.S. culture is unique in this regard 
compared to much of the world.
I knew that in Kenyan culture it is 
inappropriate to visit a friend’s home 
empty-handed. However, what is 
an appropriate gift? A piece of art? 
Dessert? A quilt? During previous 
visits to the homes of Kenyan 
friends, I never seemed to find the 
perfect gift. I had tried cookies, 
fruit, local handcrafts, you name it. I 
could always tell from reactions that 
I had missed the mark.
This time, I was determined to 
get it right. During one weekend of 
my fellowship experience, I planned 
to visit the home of my good friend 
Robinson and his family. I met 

Robinson in 2009 during my first 
trip to Kenya. We were working 
together in a community-based 
program to develop clean water 
solutions for the arid lands of Kenya. 
We became instant friends and have 
remained in contact ever since. I 
remember when his children were 
born, who are now two and six years 
old. At my wedding, he flew from 
Kenya to Oklahoma to stand up as 
one of my groomsmen.
When the opportunity arose to 
return to Kenya, I was excited for 
the opportunity to apply what I 
was learning at the Ross School of 
Business to a real-world problem. 
Through 
the 
C.K. 
Prahalad 
Fellowship, I was going to be visiting 
hospitals in Kenya and examining 
the cause of infant mortality. I was 
also exploring business solutions 
to this global problem, particularly 
through the lens of a low-cost 
ventilator that had been developed 
by an Ann Arbor startup. Outside 
of my work, I was looking forward 
to catching up with my good friend 
Robinson and family.
When the day came to visit 
Robinson’s home, I wanted to ensure 
I got it right. Kenyans are incredibly 
welcoming people and would never 
look down on a foreigner for not 
bringing a gift to dinner. However, 
it was important to me that I would 
not be seen as a foreigner, especially 

to my close friend. I spoke with 
other Kenyans, trying to decipher 
what would be an appropriate gift. 
I was told that food is a good gift to 
bring, but I had tried that before and 
failed.
After 
much 
deliberation, 
I 
decided to take a risk. Knowing that 
many Kenyans raise animals as a 
source of livelihood, I discovered 
the perfect gift. But what live 
animal could I bring? It would be 
difficult to find a sheep or goat 
in Nairobi and a chicken was too 
cheap of a present. I drove outside 
the town until I came to a small 
village where I had previously seen 
animals along the road. There I 
parked the car and described my 
predicament to the owner of a small 
vegetable stand. She immediately 
began describing a large bird she 
had seen for the first time earlier 
that day. After perusing photos on 
her cell phone, I realized she was 
referring to a turkey. I followed 
her directions into the village until 
I found it. Unfortunately, I only 
had 4,000 Kenyan Shillings in my 
pocket and that particular turkey 
was worth far more.

Cultural etiquette, learning from a fowl

Tim Carter is a University of 

Michigan alumnus.

I

f the past few weeks 
have taught us anything, 
except how misogyny is 
still swiftly flowing 
through the veins of 
America, it is that 
2018 is not the year 
of the woman.
A 
year 
after 
Anita Hill testified 
before the all-male 
Senate 
Judiciary 
Committee alleging 
Clarence 
Thomas 
sexually 
assaulted 
her, 1992 was dubbed 
the “Year of the Woman.” More 
women than ever before ran for 
elected office, many of whom 
credited the injustice of the 
Thomas hearings as a primary 
motivating 
factor. 
Current 
Sens. Dianne Feinstein and 
Patty Murray, as well as former 
Sens. Carol Moseley Braun and 
Barbara Boxer, chose to run 
for the U.S. Senate specifically 
because they were appalled at 
the treatment of Hill by the all-
male committee panel. They 
wondered what could have 
been different had there been a 
woman, or two or three, on the 
committee questioning Hill 
and Thomas.
While the strides women 
made in 1992 are important 
for the history of increasingly 
equal representation in the 
U.S. government, the year of 
the woman did not ultimately 
succeed as it ended with the 
election of a man whose sexual 
improprieties were more than 
problematic.
Almost 30 years later, many 
pundits 
and 
commentators 
have haphazardly designated 
2018 another “Year of the 
Woman” after a record number 
of women have filed to run for 
elected office and, in many 
cases, won their primaries 
and are predicted to win in 
November.
Many bad men, including 
former CBS CEO Les Moonves, 
former 
Texas 
Rep. 
Blake 
Farenthold and former news 
anchor Charlie Rose, have been 

cast down from their towers 
of power following excellent 
reporting on how each used 
their societal power 
and male privilege 
to sexually harass 
and assault women. 
For the cherry on 
top, female physicist 
Donna 
Strickland 
just won the Nobel 
Prize in physics.
At the same time, 
Brett 
Kavanaugh 
was just confirmed 
to the highest court 
in the country despite being 
credibly accused of sexual 
assault 
and 
demonstrating 
what can almost certainly be 
considered the exact opposite 
of judicial temperance.

Kavanaugh and Mark Judge, 
a 
friend 
of 
Kavanaugh’s, 
allegedly shoved Christine 
Blasey Ford into a bedroom, 
played loud music to drown out 
her cries for help, repeatedly 
and 
violently 
groped 
her 
and 
drunkenly 
attempted 
to 
remove 
her 
clothing. 
Since Ford so courageously 
shared her story of the most 
traumatic night of her life, 
several other women have 
also accused Kavanaugh of 
sexual misconduct, including 
exposing himself, forcing a 
woman to touch him without 
consent and being present 
during a gang rape.
A 
year 
of 
the 
woman 
does not include a man like 
Kavanaugh being nominated 
to the Supreme Court. It 
does not even include the 

nomination of a man who 
has 
the 
ability 
to 
strip 
the reproductive rights of 
millions of American women, 
in 
addition 
to 
stripping 
other 
individual 
freedoms 
such 
as 
voting 
rights 
or 
queer women’s right to legal 
marriage. It also does not 
include a Republican-sided 
all-male 
Senate 
Judiciary 
Committee 
that 
forces 
a 
woman to testify about the 
most traumatic moment of her 
life over several days without 
allowing other witnesses to 
testify. It does not include 
hiring a female prosecutor 
to 
question 
and 
attempt 
to discredit the woman to 
avoid bad optics — all while 
throwing 
tantrums 
about 
how this man’s life is ruined 
because he might not get the 
job he wanted. 
In a year of the woman, 
there is most certainly not a 
president of the United States 
who brags about sexually 
assaulting women, has dozens 
of sexual assault allegations 
against 
him, 
mocks 
the 
brave woman standing up 
to Kavanaugh or bemoans 
how terrible the world is to 
men while saying women are 
doing great.
The 
next 
presidential 
election will take place in 
the year marking the 100th 
anniversary of the ratification 
of 
the 
19th 
Amendment, 
which constitutionally gave 
women the right to vote; 
however, it is important to 
note it only guaranteed white 
women suffrage and it took 
another 45 years before all 
women could vote. Though 
2020 will already be symbolic 
of this anniversary, it has the 
chance to finally fulfill the 
promise of being a year for 
women through the election 
of the first female President 
of the United States.

MUSIC FESTIVAL COVERAGE

“Wait, is that Diet Cig?” Sean 
said, pointing at a duo as we 
walked past a mineral water booth. 
Over the course of one weekend at 
Audiotree Music Festival, each 
of us asked a variation on this 
question about a dozen times. 
Although it’s common to see 
musicians hanging out at festivals, 
something about being in a small 
crowd in Kalamazoo’s Arcadia 
Creek Park made these encounters 
feel even more unique.
2018 marks the sixth year of 
Chicago-based Audiotree’s annual 
music 
festival. 
Taking 
place 
in Kalamazoo, Mich. — which 
Audiotree’s two founders, Adam 
Thurston and Michael Johnston, 
call home — the mid-sized festival 
brings in a wide range of indie 
acts, many of them featured at 
one point or another in one of 
Audiotree’s 
various 
sessions. 
This year, in addition to the main 
stage, Audiotree introduced a 
smaller stage that featured a 
variety of local bands from Mich. 
and Chicago. Named the WIDR 
stage, after Western Michigan 
University’s (WMU) student radio, 
the additional performance space 
ensured that there was never a dull 
moment in between sets on the 
main stage.
It seemed like an amazing 
opportunity for a lot of local bands. 
Every group on the WIDR stage 
was either from Mich. or one of 
its neighboring states. Because the 
festival takes place in an arguable 
mecca for DIY alternative music, 
it is uniquely positioned to choose 
from a slew of talented bands that 
just haven’t yet had their moment, 
despite an abundance of talent.
The WIDR stage was also 
a result of WMU’s increasing 
involvement with the festival. 
Starting last year, Audiotree also 
partnered with WMU students 
studying visual arts, organizing 
a competition in which students 
could 
submit 
art 
meant 
to 
represent an artist playing at 
the festival. The winners of the 
competition got to see their work 
printed on quality 24” by 36” 
cardstock and sold over the course 
of the weekend.

All weekend long the sun shone 
brightly and spirits were kept high 
by a seemingly limitless supply of 
free bottles of Topo Chico. Once 
the sun set each day, temperatures 
dipped to a chilly 55 degrees or so, 
but headliners Local Natives on 
Saturday and Father John Misty on 
Sunday kept us just warm enough. 
Khruangbin and Real Estate were 
featured as sub-headliners, and 
many of the smaller acts managed 
to draw their own crowds. The 
Chicago-based 
Post 
Animal 
garnered 
a 
healthy 
audience 
despite 
their 
mid-afternoon 
time slot on Sunday, and English 
rock group Basement certainly 
benefited from being the only pop 
punk-inclined group to play the 
fest.
In addition to seeing every band 
on the main stage, we also got to 
speak with Common Holly, Diet 
Cig and Palm. Each interview 
proved to be unique in its own 
right: We engaged in some serious 
astrological philosophizing with 
Diet Cig, pondered memory and 
uncertainty with Common Holly 
and tried to discover how Palm 
pulls off sounding like Palm.

Melkbelly
Chicago’s Melkbelly was the 
first act I remember being excited 
to see. The band, led by guitarist/
vocalist Miranda Winter, embodies 
a unique sound that brings in the 
perfect ratio of pop to noise. Their 
debut album, Nothing Valley, plays 
with strange tonalities, noisy 
guitars and some catchy yet almost 
dystopian-sounding vocal lines.
The band played one of my 

favorite tracks, “Middle Of,” early 
on in their set, and I found myself 
becoming seemingly hypnotized 
by the animalistic drums and the 
aggressive-sounding guitars in the 
descending, chaotic pre-chorus. 
They were absolutely bringing 
it. However, after a few songs, 
the band lost a bit of their initial 
energy. The metaphorical space 
between the band and the audience 
grew larger from the beginning of 
the set. In their defense, they were 
playing pretty early on in the day, 
and I overheard that they did play 
a different setlist than at Pitchfork, 
so either one of these things 
might explain the decline in the 
performance. Although they had 
an incredible opening, it seemed 

that 
Melkbelly 
couldn’t 
quite 
satisfy 
the 
appetite for noise-
rock I had that 
day.

Diet Cig
Last semester, 
I took ENGR 101, 
my first coding 
class. 
And 
as 
much as I liked 
that 
class 
(sort 
of), 
I 
resented 
the final project 
because it kept 
me from seeing 
Palm and Diet Cig 
play the Union. So 
when Diet Cig was 
announced on the 
Audiotree lineup, 
I was incredibly 
excited to right 
the 
wrongs 
of 
ENGR 101.
And 
what 
a 
wrong that was.
Diet 
Cig 
not 
only 
had 
an 
incredible 
amount of energy 
on-stage, but they 
had an incredible 
connection 
with 
the 
audience. 
Despite 
wearing 
a leg brace caused 
by a torn ACL, 
Alex Luciano, the 
band’s 
guitarist 
and vocalist, was 
dancing around on 
the stage, kicking 
her leg up to the 
stars to show off 
her 
seemingly 
robotic leg. The 
now-three-piece 
had a huge live 
sound, 
despite 
their 
limited 
instrumentation, 
and, in some cases, 

sounded as good as their recorded 
material, if not better. Hearing 
Alex’s voice belt out her choruses 
with Noah Bowman pounding the 
skins of the drums felt earnestly 
powerful live.
Before the music even started, 
Alex addressed the audience, 
ensuring 
that 
everyone 
was 
comfortable and the environment 
was kept positive and safe. She 
also took some time to emphasize 
how important it was for everyone 
to register to vote and actually go 
out to the polls, an issue that she 
believes, especially in this political 
climate, 
is 
overwhelmingly 
important.
I 
found 
myself 
dancing 
throughout 
the 
entire 

performance, 
but 
more 
importantly, 
I 
found 
myself 
listening to every single element 
intently. Although the group may 
have an uncaring DIY look, their 
sound is extremely intentional. For 
a group with only three people, 
Diet Cig produces an enormously 
huge sound, aided significantly 
by 
Luciano’s 
powerful 
vocal 
performances.

Palm
This might have been my 
favorite 
performance 
at 
this 
festival.
I was exposed to Palm last 
summer with the release of their 
Shadow Expert EP. I had no idea 
what to think. Blending elements of 
so many different genres, sticking 
one label on this band would be a 
huge mistake. I was worried about 
how their sound would translate 
to a live environment, but to 
slightly surprisingly, they sounded 
extraordinarily clean and almost 
exactly like their records. Whether 
it was the timbre of the guitars, the 
rhythmic complexity of the rhythm 
section, 
or 
the 
mesmerizing, 
chorus-heavy vocal lines, every 
nuance was present. There were a 
few times where I caught myself 
marveling at how the performance 
was actually happening. I felt like I 
was slipping in and out of a trance. 
The band was extraordinarily 
tight, despite the chaos present in 
their performance. I frequently 
caught myself noticing elements of 
the performance at a micro level, 
like how drummer Hugo Stanley 
seamlessly transitioned from live 
electronic drum samples to the 
acoustic kit, or how guitarists 
Eve Alpert and Kasra Kurt subtly 
played off of each other’s guitar 
riffs and vocal harmonies.
As the art-rock group finished 
their six-song set with a track from 
their new album “Dog Milk,” I 
finally started to realize that what 
felt like five minutes to me had 
turned into a 30-minute set. As 
the band concluded their extended 

jam-like outro to the song, I found 
myself turning to Sean and simply 
mouthing the word: “Wow.”
— Ryan Cox, Daily Arts Writer
Father John Misty
I’ve missed seeing Father John 
Misty more times than I can 
count, despite being a massive fan 
of not only Josh Tillman’s music 
and lyrics, but his personality as 
well. I had a friend see him shortly 
after the release of I Love You, 
Honeybear and show me a video of 
him picking up her phone from the 
stage, recording a video of himself 
making snarky comments to the 
audience before finally returning 
her phone. His weird fascination 
with Taylor Swift, whether it be 
through a quick name drop or 
covering her songs in the style of 
Lou Reed, is a weird quirk that I 
find absolutely hysterical. I used 
to really love this man, despite his 
disappointing third studio album 
Pure Comedy.
And while I’ve heard of all 
these crazy things Tillman has 
done at shows, he really didn’t 
do anything out of the ordinary 
at Audiotree. Aside from a few 
sarcastic comments about how 
annoying the beach balls at 
festivals are, a sentiment I agree 
with 
wholeheartedly, 
there 
wasn’t a huge amount of audience 
interaction. But what was so 
amazing about the performance 
was how good it was despite Josh 
failing to go into some long rant 
about nothing or cover some crazy 
Def Leppard song following a 
slightly more vulgar “Screw you” 
to the audience.
While he did have a rather 
large 
ensemble 
behind 
him, 
certain songs featured differing 
instrumentations: The trumpet 
solo at the end of “Chateau Lobby 
#4 (in C for Two Virgins)” was 
replaced with a slightly more 
aggressive guitar solo. Tillman’s 
voice sounds fantastic live, and 
with the release of his fourth 
studio 
album 
God’s 
Favorite 
Customer, he had an abundance of 
songs to pick from, both new and 
old.
For me, the highlight of the 
festival as a whole was hearing 
Tillman yell the lines, “Maybe 
love is just an economy based on 
resource scarcity, but I fail to see 
is what that’s gotta do with you 
and me” right before the weekend 
ended. I could feel my high school 
self sneak out and remember, even 
if for just a few seconds, a time 
when that album accompanied 
a 
very 
transformative 
period 
in my life. It made traveling to 
Kalamazoo a pilgrimage of sorts; 
it felt like returning to a childhood 
home.
— Ryan Cox, Daily Arts Writer
NE-HI
The 
Chicago-based 
NE-HI 
have been on my radar for some 
time and, despite having been 
disappointed by them at Pitchfork 
Music Fest back in 2017, I was 
impressed by their performance. 
More or less led by the illustrious 
guitarist-vocalist Jason Balla, the 
four-piece plays good ’ol fashioned 
modern rock ‘n’ roll. By the time 
Audiotree weekend rolled around, 
though, I was a biased audience — 
over the course of the past year, 
I’ve come to love a good handful of 
NE-HI’s Chicago contemporaries. 
Balla actually plays in another 
group called Dehd, a group 
whose bassist also plays in Lala 
Lala (who just came out with an 
excellent record). He also released 
a solo album, Blue Tape, under his 
Accessory moniker at the end of 
this past summer.
Either way, you’d be forgiven 
for thinking Balla were truly 

possessed on stage. When he’s 
not busy providing vocals, he’s 
like a miniature version of one of 
those wacky waving inflatable arm 
flailing tube men, with one key 
distinction: He’s not stuck in one 
place. I spent almost the entirety of 
NE-HI’s set captivated by Balla’s 
antics, but that’s not to dismiss 
the rest of the NE-HI crew. 
Bassist James Weir, drummer 
Alex Otake and guitarist-vocalist 
Mikey Wells’s more-than-solid 
musicianship is the only reason 
Balla can afford to be so free. 
Leaving the stage after NE-HI’s 
far-too-short half hour set had 
me wondering what had put me 
off just over a year earlier. I never 
quite figured it out, but I knew I’d 
never go back.
— Sean Lang, Daily Arts Writer
Local Natives
For better or worse, I’ve long 
adored the Los Angeles-based 
Local Natives. Pandora radio led 
me to Gorilla Manor back in high 
school, and I eventually became 
enamored with its boisterous 
energy 
and 
instrumental 
intricacies. I latched onto the 
band’s oh-so-sweet harmonies and 
followed them right into 2013’s 
Hummingbird, where they were, 
yeah, sadder, but again so good. 
When the group’s third album 
Sunlit Youth came in 2016, I lost 
no small amount of faith. Their 
sound became “more full” in the 
way indie outfits typically do when 
they reach for wider crowds. It also 
seemed as though they decided 
they were going to be a Socially 
Conscious 
Alternative 
Rock 
Band,™ with clunkers like “How 
can we quit drugs if you’re gonna 
watch like that?” or the poorly 
aged “I have waited so long, Mrs. 
President,” a line their vocalist-
guitarist Taylor Rice insisted on 
singing as written during the 
band’s Audiotree performance.
All this being said, the five-
piece reliably delivered on all of 
their material. Now that it’s been 
over two years since Sunlit Youth 
first saw the light of day, they 
worked pretty deep into the back 
catalog. Local Natives played an 
18-song set, but only five of them 
came from Sunlit Youth. With 
their extra time, they treated the 
audience to six Gorilla Manor 
tracks — including longstanding 
show-closer “Sun Hands” and 
deep cut “World News” — five 
Hummingbird cuts — including a 
longer breakdown of “Colombia,” 
vocalist-multi-instrumentalist 
Kelcey Ayer’s ode to his departed 
grandmother, and the deep deep 
cut “Mt. Washington” — the one-
off single “I Saw You Close Your 
Eyes” and a new song, “When Am 
I Gonna Lose You?”
— Sean Lang, Daily Arts Writer
Common Holly
Although she was the first act 
up on the second day of Audiotree, 
the act I was most excited to see all 
weekend was probably Montreal-
native Brigitte Naggar’s Common 
Holly project. After hearing her 
first single “If After All” on NPR’s 
All Songs Considered last year, 
I was entranced. Her publicist 
likens her to Angel Olsen or a 
female Leonard Cohen, but I prefer 
a less pretentious resemblance 
— her music reminded me of 
Daughter’s first album, When You 
Leave, which has soundtracked 
my every autumn for the past 
six years. Either way, Naggar’s 
songwriting is uniquely fresh and 
unpredictably eclectic.
Five minutes before she and 
her band took to the stage, there 
were about 11 of us in the crowd. 
Thankfully, this number swelled 
to about 25-30 by noon, when the 
band walked out. Every note was 
carefully played, every melody 
tenderly sung and the songs, 
whose studio versions are imbued 
with a sense of restlessness, of 
life, became even more so played 
live. At one point during her set, 
Naggar turned to the VIP section 
of the audience — off to the left 
and on the other side of a fence — 
and asked them if they felt special. 
Her tone wasn’t incriminating, 
nor do I think it was meant to 
make them feel uncomfortable. 
It was humanizing to see her sort 
of nervously, accidentally call out 
the VIP crowd. Before being cut 
off early by the festival crew — 
and I will never forgive them for 
this, as she clearly had three more 
minutes left to play — she debuted 
a new song, leaving me more 
excited than ever for the future of 
this up-and-coming group.

THE ATLANTIC

Inside the mind of Alec 
Baldwin, star of SMTD’s 
‘Death of a Salesman’

“For me, acting used to be 
like sex,” Alec Baldwin said to 
a group of the School of Music, 
Theatre & Dance students on 
Sunday morning, the day after 
his performance. “I would just 
do it with anybody, anywhere. 
And then, I got a little bit 
older, and, well, I thought, 
maybe it’s time I got a bit more 
selective.”
The 
night 
before, 
on 
Saturday, Sept. 29, Baldwin 
joined 
a 
group 
of 
SMTD 
students 
and 
faculty 
to 
perform a dramatic reading 
of Arthur Miller’s “Death of a 
Salesman” at the Power Center. 
The play was performed in its 
entirety, running for almost 
three hours, to a sold-out 
audience of over 1,300 people. 
Baldwin, 
who 
had 
never 
played the role of Willy Loman 
before, arrived in Ann Arbor 
that Friday night. He’d been 
here once before, “a million 
years ago,” he said, during the 
time he was a college student 
himself, to visit a friend.
Baldwin began his own 
college 
career 
at 
George 
Washington 
University 
in 
D.C., majoring in political 
science 
and 
intending 
on 
going 
to 
law 
school. 
He 
attended for a few years before 
a friend convinced him to take 
an audition at NYU Tisch for 
their acting program. He took 
the audition and was awarded 
a full scholarship.
“My parents flipped out 
when I told them,” Baldwin 
said of breaking the news to 
his parents that he planned 
to transfer. But then, he said, 
he broke down the financials 
for them, proving that, as a 
New York State resident (he is 
originally from Long Island), 
it would actually be cheaper 
for him to attend NYU. “And 
then suddenly,” Baldwin said, 
“my dad was like, ‘Wait. Let’s 
hear him out.’”
In the early ’80s, not even 
a year into acting school, 
Baldwin was working at a 
restaurant and waited on a 
casting director. The director 
was casting a new soap, and 
told him he was exactly what 
they were looking for. He took 
an audition for “The Doctors,” 
got 
the 
part 
and 
started 
working. He went on to work 
steadily from then on, proving 
himself as a versatile actor 
and force to be reckoned with, 
starring in material across 
all genres — drama, comedy, 
romance, animation, etc. — 
and excelling in each.
His personal life closely 
parallels his professional life. 
His role in “30 Rock,” one of 
his most famous and recent 
roles, was offered to him right 
after his divorce from actress 
Kim Basinger. The job was in 
L.A. where their daughter, 
Ireland Baldwin, lived, and 
so he decided to take the job 
to ensure he would be in L.A. 
often — close to his daughter. 
He commuted every other 
weekend for five years.
“It turned into one of the 
best jobs of my life,” Baldwin 
said of his time on “30 Rock.” 
“It ruined me. I was working 

with some of the smartest 
writers I’ll ever know — the 
funniest people alive. Other 
people don’t know what funny 
is (compared to them).”
A theatre student in the 
audience 
quipped 
that 
in 
Amy Poehler’s (“Making It,” 
“Parks and Recreation”) book, 
“Yes Please,” she writes that 
Baldwin is always the funniest 
person in the room, wherever 
he goes.
“Amy Poehler smokes a lot 
of weed,” Baldwin whispered 

in response.
Throughout his time here, 
Baldwin was glowing with 
paternal pride. Every chance 
he got, Baldwin spoke of his 
wife and kids — he has four 
kids with Hilaria Baldwin, all 
under the age of five — joking 
that she pops the children out 
“like popcorn.”
A 
lifetime 
New 
Yorker, 
Baldwin 
is 
also 
heavily 
involved 
with 
the 
New 
York 
Philharmonic, 
having 
donated one million dollars 
to them in 2011, as well as 
serving on their board and 
hosting 
their 
nationally 
syndicated radio show, “The 
New York Philharmonic This 
Week.” Matthew VanBiesen, 
the 
current 
president 
of 
University Musical Society — 
who presented this production 
of “Death of a Salesman”— was 
president of the New York 
Philharmonic until 2017, a 
time during which he and Alec 

Baldwin met and became close 
friends. When the prospect of 
doing the dramatic reading 
was proposed to Baldwin, he 
agreed. Baldwin explained his 
wife’s surprise: “She was like, 
wow, I didn’t realize you liked 
Matthew that much!”
Ultimately, the production 
was pulled together in under 
24 hours. The rest of the cast — 
theatre students Jack Alberts, 
Nico 
Dangla, 
Ted 
Gibson, 
Juliana 
Tassos, 
Jackson 
Verolini, AJ D’Ambrosio, Lolly 
Duus, Georgia Spears, Marty 
McGuire, 
Sam 
Schoenfeld 
and 
Skylar 
Siben, 
and 
professors Priscilla Lindsay, 
Eva Rosenwald, Leigh Woods, 
Alex 
Leydenfrost, 
Blake 
Griffey and Daniel Cantor — 
had been rehearsing for a few 
weeks, but only had one full 
rehearsal with Baldwin on 
the day of the show. He and 
the cast rehearsed for around 
four hours, running through 
the entire show, took a dinner 
break from 5:00 to 7:00 p.m., 
and then were back at Power 
Center to prepare for curtain 
at 8:00 p.m.
With no scenery, costumes, 
props or music to distract 
from 
what 
Arthur 
Miller 
had written, it was quite an 
intimate experience: All we 
had were the words — the 
emotionally 
heavy 
prose 
that has earned itself the 
reputation of being one of the 
greatest plays ever written. 
(Fun 
Fact: 
Arthur 
Miller 
graduated from the University 
in 1938 and wrote for The 
Michigan Daily! There is a 
theatre named after him on 
North Campus.)
Baldwin’s performance as 
Willy Loman was searing, 
emotional 
and 
compelling. 
The story, which follows the 
Loman family — Willy, Linda, 
Biff and Happy — centers on 
the conflict between Willy’s 
dreams of being well-liked, 
financially 
successful 
and 
happy, and his opposing reality 
of being an aging, defeated 
salesman. It switches between 
present day and flashbacks, 
which show Willy’s complex 
and flawed relationship with 
his sons and wife.
“A great play is both of its 
time, and beyond its time,” 
said director Daniel Cantor, 
during his opening remarks 
before the beginning of the 
show.
“Death 
of 
a 
Salesman” 
has proven to be both. It 
is a story that still holds 
incredible relevance, and has 
a fierce impact on audiences. 
Saturday’s production was one 
of utmost professionalism and 
poignancy. The chemistry on 
stage between the students, 
professors and Mr. Baldwin 
was raw, organic and gripping.
At 
the 
reception 
that 
followed 
the 
marathon 
of 
a 
performance, 
Baldwin 
remarked that the University, 
with its campus life, sports, 
academics 
and 
arts, 
is 
regarded, indubitably, as one 
of the best schools in the 
country.
“Next 
time,” 
he 
said, 
exciting 
guests 
with 
the 
possibility of there being a 
“next time,” “we will have to 
do this as a fundraiser.”

COMMUNITY CULTURE

Cloud rap crosses the 
pond, finds little new

I 
always 
wondered 
why 
cloud rap never really took 
off. The genre’s heyday of 
like, five years ago, was a 
fascinating 
departure 
from 
the mainstream, which itself 
was at a rather dull point, as 
it straddled the end of the 
era of Wayne and the trap 
boom. Clams Casino and the 
magical Bay Area rapper Lil 
B were the genre’s pioneers, 
with the former having the 
biggest influence on the genre’s 
trademark hazy, lo-fi sound. 
Music 
writers 
collectively 
increased their use of the 
word “ethereal” one thousand-
fold and never looked back. 
The sounds of cloud rap were 
also plastered all over A$AP 
Rocky’s debut Live.Love.ASAP 
and the music of the Swedish 
rapper Yung Lean. But then 
after 2014, it was swept away 
by the Chief Keefs and Young 
Thugs of the world, never to be 
heard of since.
It turns out it had just had 
a 
premature 
midlife 
crisis 
and moved to France. More 
precisely, a duo of Frenchmen 
from the troubled “banlieues” 
of Paris had decided to carry 
its flame. The duo PNL (Peace 
and Lovés) has seen a meteoric 
rise to arguably become the 
Francophone 
world’s 
most 
popular hip-hop group. Little is 
known about the members 
Ademo 
and 
N.O.S. 
themselves, beyond the fact 
that their real names are 
Tarik and Nabil and that 
they are from the banlieues. 
Their social media profiles 
are sparse, with little other 
than announcements about 
new releases.
Their appeal is readily 
apparent 
in 
their 
two 
biggest hits, “Le monde 
ou rien” (“The world or 
nothing”) and “Oh lala.” 
The 
instrumentals 
for 
both 
are 
classic 
cloud 
rap, 
with 
washed-out 
synthesizers and little else 
save for snippets of guitar 
licks. The pair, heavily 
autotuned, rap about the 
depressing realities of life 
in the heavily segregated 
and 
neglected 
Parisian 
suburbs, mostly comprised 
of immigrants from North 
and 
West 
Africa. 
The 
chorus of “Le monde ou 
rien” sums it up in a way 
that 
is 
simultaneously 
nihilistic 
and 
easy 
to 
chant along to at a concert. 
Ademo sings, “J’suis dans 
ma bulle, bulle, bulle / Oh 
shit, le shit, le shit, bulle 
/ Sang sur l’pull, pull, 

pull, olala olala / Dégage ton 
boule, boule, boule” (“I’m in 
my bubble, bubble, bubble / 
Oh shit, the hash, the hash is 
bubbling / Blood on my sweater, 
sweater, sweater, oh my my, oh 
my my”). Like much of their 
music, there is a mixture of 

reservation towards the reality 
of their situation (“I’m in my 
bubble”), a clever turn of phrase 
towards something like drug 
dealing (“Le shit bulle” roughly 
translating 
to 
“The 
hash 
bubbles”) and a threatening 
command to simply get out of 

the duo’s lives.
Another common reference 
is towards the sanctity of 
family unity, represented in 
one the group’s slogan “QLF” 
(“Que la famille,” “for the 
family”). The videos for these 
two singles are fitting as well, 
with “Le monde ou rien” taking 
place in the equally neglected 
suburbs of Naples, and “Oh lala” 
allowing the brothers to flex in 
the otherworldly landscapes 
of 
Iceland. 
In 
the 
videos 
and 
the 
songs 
themselves, 
the duo portrays a mixture 
of confidence and bravado, 
necessary to navigate the world 
around them, but also a sense of 
vulnerability and desperation. 
The moments of self-reflection 
and 
awareness 
are 
unique 
and emotional, such as when 
Ademo sings, “J’rentre, coke 
dans les poches, quand p’tit 
frère part à l’école” (“I come 
back home with coke in my 
pockets while my little brother 
leaves for school”).
PNL’s wide appeal mostly 
stems from its sheer catchiness 
and 
production. 
However, 
digging deeper reveals skillful 
and 
poignant 
observations 
about life in the neglected 
immigrant 
communities 
of 
European metropolises such 
as Paris (and really, around the 
world), areas which many have 
strong opinions of, but which 
receive little assistance with 
stopping the cycle of poverty 
and hopelessness.

No. 15 Michigan topples Terrapins for fifth win in a row

The way Shea Patterson 
contorted his body to set up 
his throw could be considered 
inadvisable. But it was good 
enough to find the end zone.
From the Maryland 22-yard 
line, with 16 seconds left in 
the first half, Patterson passed 
across his body to hit a crossing 
Ronnie Bell right on the 
numbers, and the freshman 
wide receiver stumbled his way 
in for the touchdown.
“How about my guy Ronnie 
Bell making the tough catch 
across the middle,” said coach 
Jim Harbaugh. “It takes guys 
years, sometimes decades or 
decades to have that kind of 
fearless and ability to catch a ball 
over the middle, and not only 
catch it but finish it.”
The score set the No. 15 
Michigan football team up 
with a two-possession lead into 
halftime and the beginning of a 
runaway against the Terrapins. 

The Wolverines (3-0 Big Ten, 
5-1 overall) would outgain 
Maryland, 465 to 220 yards, on 
Saturday afternoon en route to a 
42-21 victory.
The contest against the 
Terrapins (1-1, 3-2) was 
originally in doubt with overcast 
skies delaying the game 70 
minutes. A sopping field beget 
a ground-and-pound strategy 
from Michigan out of the gate. 
Senior running back Karan 
Higdon finished the day with 
25 carries — 19 in the first half 
— for 103 yards. Sophomore 
fullback Ben Mason had five 
carries — three to convert short-
yardage first downs — and the 
Wolverines’ first score of the 
day.
But Mason’s day was 
summarized by his highlight 
reel play. After receiving a pass 
in the flat, Mason turned upfield 
and hurdled a defender for a 
15-yard reception.
“I saw it on his high school 
tape and I didn’t think I’d see it 
again,” said sophomore center 
Cesar Ruiz. “I saw it out of the 

corner of my eye today. I had 
to look at the video screen and 
make sure.”
Maryland, on the other 
hand, couldn’t pull any stunts 
— it hardly had time to develop 
any semblance of an offensive 
strategy. Michigan’s defense 
allowed just 42 yards in the 
first half, with the Terrapins’ 
only points coming on a 98-yard 
kickoff return. For the game, 
quarterbacks Kasim Hill and 
Tyrrell Pigrome combined to 
complete seven of 13 attempts 
for 73 yards and a pick.
“It was really an epic 
defensive performance,” 
Harbaugh said. “We got a little 
thin toward the end of the game, 
but it was a great job, great 
performance. This Maryland 
team has a very potent running 
game. … We’d seen it on tape, a 
lot of misdirection, a lot of eye 
distraction and ability to open 
up seams, lots of longs runs — 
we didn’t give those up today.”
Despite a depleted defensive 
line — Rashan Gary and 
Aubrey Solomon were sidelined 

with injuries, and Michael 
Dwumfour exited in the second 
quarter with a non-contact 
injury — the Wolverines’ 
front seven wreaked havoc all 
afternoon. Dwumfour recorded 
a sack before his early departure, 
and junior VIPER Khaleke 
Hudson had his first sack of the 
year. And in garbage time, fifth-
year senior cornerback Brandon 
Watson returned an interception 
to the house.
The absent interior was 
certainly missed on Maryland’s 
final drive, though. Pigrome 
took off for a 41-yard run as 
well as a five-yard rushing 
touchdown up the middle.
“There has been a couple 
bang-ups on the d-line,” Hudson 
said. “But we just trust in the 
backups to come in and do what 
they gotta do and work hard and 
get the job done. The linebackers 
are doing what we’ve gotta do 
and the safeties counter off of 
that.”
And despite those few lapses, 
Patterson quietly kept the 
offense humming on Saturday, 

his theatrics not limited to Bell’s 
touchdown. With 2:15 left in the 
third quarter, Patterson spun 
away from two-man pressure 
— what Harbaugh called a 
“whirly bird” — to find Donovan 
Peoples-Jones open down the 
right sideline with running 
room for a 34-yard touchdown.
The junior quarterback 
finished the day 19-for-27 for 
three touchdowns and 282 
yards, surpassing his season-
high in passing yards on the 
throw to Peoples-Jones. Junior 
tight end Zach Gentry also 
had a career day as Patterson’s 
go-to, grabbing highs of seven 
receptions for 112 yards.
“It was players making plays 
today,” Harbaugh said. “That’s 
really what I saw, starting with 
Shea. Guys just making plays. 
Gentry making plays, finding 
seams, making the catches. … It 
was really the theme through 
this game: players making 
plays.”
Saturday’s game hardly made 
any declarative statements about 
Michigan’s potential headed into 

the second half of the season. 
But strides in the offensive line 
portended confidence with an 
impending three-game slate 
against No. 18 Wisconsin, No. 
20 Michigan State and No. 11 
Penn State. Patterson stayed 
upright the whole contest, and 
the ground game managed 171 
yards, 4.3 per carry.
“Offensive line is playing 
well,” Harbaugh said. 
“(Offensive line coach) Ed 
Warinner is doing a heck of a job 
with those guys. I think they’re 
all playing their best football, 
starting from Jon Runyan, Ben 
Bredeson, Cesar Ruiz, Mike 
Onwenu, and Juwann (Bushell-
Beatty). (They) are all playing 
their best football and playing 
well together.”
The Wolverines could very 
well hit the reset button in the 
week against stiffer competition. 
After all, Ben Mason hurdles 
and Shea Patterson “whirly 
birds” are far from a given. But 
you would be hard-pressed to 
question a setback based on 
Saturday’s blowout.

Here’s the season for Michigan
M

ichigan sophomore 
fullback Ben Mason 
says he’s looking 
forward to next week’s game 
against 
Wisconsin.
So are we.
This is 
the season-
defining 
stretch 
for the 
Wolverines, 
a gauntlet 
of three 
difficult 
games. 
Wisconsin, Michigan State, 
Penn State.
“The beginning of the 
schedule was prep to get 
through these,” said junior 
linebacker Devin Bush Jr., 
“and I feel like we’re ready.”
All the offseason talk 
of improvement, of being 
ready for the big games, of 
contending for a Big Ten 
title and a bid to the college 
football playoffs — all that 
talk comes to a head next 
week.
Because everything 
Michigan wants is still on the 
table. All of the Wolverines’ 
goals were still there for the 
taking even after their ugly 
season-opening loss at Notre 
Dame on Sept. 
1.
It feels like 
that game took 
place ages ago. 
In the context 
of a 12-game 
season, it did.
Against the 
Fighting Irish, 
Michigan 
started slow 
out of the gate. 
It fell behind, 
21-3, and that was too much 
to overcome, because the 
Wolverines couldn’t give 
Shea Patterson enough time 
in the pocket. They couldn’t 
establish the run game. They 
couldn’t make big plays when 

they needed to; they gave up 
big plays when they could 
least afford to.
Basically, they looked a lot 
like they did last year, when 
they stumbled 
to an 8-5 
season.
In a way, 
this team is 
still dealing 
with some of 
those same 
issues. No one 
has forgotten 
Michigan’s 
17-0 deficit at 
Northwestern 
last week. The 
offense still has drives in 
which it looks stagnant.
But there’s plenty that’s 
different now, too.
It starts up front. Give 
the Wolverines’ offensive 
line credit. They talked all 

offseason about simplifying 
things, about the effect of 
new offensive line coach Ed 
Warriner. 
Against Notre Dame, it 
looked like that 
talk was just 
that: talk.
But the 
offensive line 
has steadily 
improved. To 
borrow the 
lingo of Jim 
Harbaugh, it’s 
an ascending 
unit. They kept 
Patterson clean 
against Western 
Michigan, SMU and Nebraska.
Then the linemen did the 
same against Northwestern’s 
Joe Gaziano and Maryland’s 
Jesse Aniebonam, two of the 
conference’s premier pass-
rushing ends.

The run game has been 
consistent, too. Karan 
Higdon is averaging over 
100 rushing yards per game. 
Mason continues to plow over 
defenders in 
short-yardage 
situations.
And, of 
course, 
Patterson has 
been everything 
Michigan 
needed him to 
be. He has been 
one of the best 
quarterbacks in 
the conference 
so far. He 
has been a steady presence 
under center, and when 
things go wrong, he can still 
make plays like the 34-yard 
touchdown pass he completed 
to sophomore receiver 
Donovan Peoples-Jones, when 

Patterson spun away from the 
rush, flipped it to Peoples-
Jones and watched as his 
receiver did the rest.
That’s the sign of a good 
quarterback: 
he makes the 
easy plays look 
routine, and 
does the same 
with the hard 
plays.
Patterson is 
on a roll, and 
his impact can’t 
be understated. 
He has already 
surpassed the 
total number of 
touchdowns Michigan threw 
all of last season, and he did 
so in six games.
That has opened things 
up for the offense, too. In 
stark contrast, Michigan is 
opening its playbook up. The 

Wolverines are adding layers 
to what they’d shown through 
the first few weeks.
Last year, it was the 
opposite. On the ground, 
Michigan scrapped its zone 
running schemes and went 
with a steady diet of powers 
and counters. It asked even 
less of its quarterbacks.
The offense looks like a 
more consistent unit than last 
year’s. It looks ahead of where 
it was against Notre Dame.
The defense has been great, 
too, like it was expected to be. 
There have been minor blips 
on the radar; the unit would 
probably have liked to have 
several drives against Notre 
Dame and Northwestern back. 
Still, this has been one of 
the best units in the nation. 
It has beaten up on the teams 
that it should’ve, and now it’ll 
have a chance to prove itself 
against Wisconsin’s power-
run game, the dual-threat 
capability of Michigan State 
quarterback Brian Lewerke 
and the explosiveness of Penn 
State’s offense.
Think of the past five games 
as homework assignments. 
The Badgers are a midterm 
exam. So are the Spartans 
and the Nittany Lions. All 
in preparation for the final 
against No. 3 
Ohio State. 
Michigan 
lost to all four 
teams last fall. 
It wasn’t good 
enough.
The 
Wolverines 
believe they’re 
good enough 
this year. They 
think they’re 
ready for this 
stretch. We’ll find out if that’s 
true after these next three 
weeks.

Gentry notches career highs against Maryland

Ask Jim Harbaugh where 
redshirt junior tight end Zach 
Gentry has grown most, then sit 
back and listen.
First, to the physical stature.
“The way he’s grown most is 
probably putting on 40 pounds 
of muscle.”
That’s not all.
“He’s 
grown 
so much as a 
blocker.”
Then to his 
receiving ability.
“He’s 
grown 
as 
a 
hands 
catcher; 
he’s 
able 
to 
pluck 
the ball out of 
the air with the 
hands. He’s got a 
great frame and target, a great 
catch radius. But also makes the 
tight body catch, the contested 
catch.”
Missing anything?
“And 
he’s 
got 
the 
best 
attitude you ever want to be 
around a guy.”
In Saturday’s 42-21 win over 
Maryland, Gentry added seven 
catches and 112 yards — both 
career highs — to a rapidly 
ascending 
breakout 
season. 
The former quarterback has 

evolved into the top target in 
Michigan’s receiving corps. He 
now leads all Wolverines pass 
catchers with 20 catches and 
306 yards, nearly matching his 
career output prior to this year 
(20 catches for 324 yards). 
When Harbaugh and his 
staff envisioned what a 6-foot-8 
high school quarterback with a 
4.6-second 40-yard dash could 
do at tight end, 
this is what they 
envisioned. 
A 
quarterback’s 
best 
friend. 
A 
matchup 
nightmare.
It 
should 
have 
been 
a 
sign of things 
to come when, 
in 
the 
face 
of 
adversity, 
Patterson turned to Gentry 
against 
SMU 
to 
open 
up 
the offense. In that contest, 
Patterson found Gentry down 
the seam on a crucial 3rd and 
four, after the Wolverines had 
started the game with three 
drives and zero points.
Against 
Northwestern, 
another 
sign. 
This 
time, 
Patterson looked for Gentry 
on the game-winning drive. 
The duo completed two crucial 
receptions, including a laser 

throw and catch to put Michigan 
in a goal-to-go situation.
These aren’t trends anymore, 
though. They are facts. Gentry 
is the primary weapon in 
the passing game and the 
player most trusted by junior 
quarterback Shea Patterson.
A reporter posed Patterson 
a question of that ilk after the 
game.
Shea, can you 
talk about your 
connection 
with 
Zach 
Gentry 
today?
“Ah, 
yeah,” 
Patterson 
said. 
“That’s my boy.”
When 
Patterson got to 
Michigan, Gentry 
was one of the 
first to welcome 
him with open arms. That 
relationship is now bearing 
fruit on the field, as well.
“He’s a heck of a target,” 
Patterson said. “You can really 
put it anywhere — (6-foot-
8), fast too. Kinda like (Rob 
Gronkowski) out there. He’s 
going to play this game for a 
long time. Just excited I can 
throw the ball to him.”
Against 
the 
Terrapins, 
Gentry showed all the tools that 
have enticed him to Harbaugh 

and Patterson. He caught balls 
down the seam. He showed an 
ability to find pockets in the 
zone. He caught a pass with a 
defender draped on his back. 
He even showed that much-
improved run blocking. 
It hasn’t always been this 
smooth for the New Mexico 
native, though. His transition 
from quarterback tight end 
— 
while 
retrospectively 
a blessing in 
disguise 
— 
caused 
some 
frustration for 
Gentry.
“At 
the 
time, 
it 
was 
upsetting,” 
Gentry 
told 
The Daily on 
Sept. 10. “I had 
never played another position 
other than quarterback my 
entire life. Being recruited to 
be one, it was a little upsetting.”
Just four weeks ago, after 
a win over SMU in which 
Gentry registered four catches 
for 95 yards, he admitted that 
he had been frustrated early 
in the season with his lack of 
involvement. In the first two 
games of the season, Gentry 
registered just three catches 
for 31 yards. He knew he was 
capable of more.
“I hadn’t been maybe as 
involved as I wanted to be the 
first couple games,” Gentry 
said at the time. “I was just 
kind of patiently waiting.”
Wait no longer.
For the redshirt junior tight 
end, it’s all coming together at 
the right time. If he continues 
down this path, it’s not hard 
to imagine an All-Big Ten 
season, a high selection in the 
NFL draft. The Gronkowski 
comparisons 
come 
across 
as 
premature 
but 
hardly 
unimaginable.
Finally, 68 seconds after he 
began, Harbaugh tied up his 
answer into a bow.
“He’s really worked hard,” 
Harbaugh said. “Everything 
you want a tight end to be, 
he’s really growing into a 
prototypical type of tight end.”

Watson pick-six marks 
growth of senior corner

The Michigan football team’s 
game against Maryland was not 
in doubt with just over 4:30 to 
play.
The 15th-ranked Wolverines 
had just driven down the field 
and scored to go up, 35-14, and 
the Terrapins’ ensuing drive 
felt more like an effort to make 
the score respectable than an 
attempt to climb back into things.
So on third down, when 
Maryland quarterback Kasim 
Hill dropped back and threw 
a 46-yard pick-six to fifth-year 
senior 
cornerback 
Brandon 
Watson, the greatest effect was 
not on the result of the game. 
Instead, it was on Watson and his 
teammates, who have seen him 
develop into a solid cornerback 
and a leader on the defense.
“He’s very deserving of that,” 
said senior safety Tyree Kinnel. 
“He’s like one of the old guys 
around here, so, you know, 
everyone respects him. Everyone 
looks up to him around the 
building. And he’s been working 
so hard through his five years 
here, and that’s a well-deserved 
play for him. I’m just happy 
for him. I know he’s happy for 
himself, and everything’s good. 
I thought we played really well 
today, and he’s a big part of the 
reason why.”
The 
play 
continued 
what 
could only be categorized as a 
successful season for Watson 
so far. He has been one of the 
biggest surprises, considering his 
past within the program.
Watson 
was 
a 
three-star 
recruit in the class of 2014. He 
redshirted his freshman year, 
and for the last three seasons, has 
wavered between being mainly a 
special teams contributor and 
a cornerback when the starters 
need a spell.
There wasn’t much reason to 
believe that would change this 
season, as juniors Lavert Hill 
and David Long were one of the 
best cornerback tandems in the 

country last season.
But ever since the beginning 
of Michigan’s season opener 
against Notre Dame, Watson has 
consistently rotated in alongside 
Hill and Long. In fact, he made 
an instant impact, recording his 
first career interception against 
the Fighting Irish.
You could even make the case 
that Watson has been the most 
consistent cornerback on the 
Wolverines’ roster.
“B-Wat been consistent since 
last year, in my opinion” said 
junior linebacker Devin Bush. 
“He’s been consistent since last 
year, this offseason, spring ball, 
camp, you know, he’s always been 
B-Wat. So, I mean, I expect that 
out of him.”
Perhaps the difference this 
season is Watson’s experience, 
which has catapulted him into a 
leadership position on a defense 
chock full of talent.
“He’s developed a lot as a 
leader, you know, leading our 
defense, 
making 
sure 
we’re 
doing everything we’ve gotta 
do, taking over the corners room 
as a leader,” said junior VIPER 
Khaleke Hudson. “He’s a great 
leader for us, and I really like 
him.”
“He’s grown, technique-wise. 
He’s grown into a leader,” added 
Kinnel. “... With me and him 
being the leaders back there, 
we just try to motivate and be 
the leaders back there. And he’s 
improved so much individually, 
so I’m excited for him.”
The theme here, of course, is 
happiness for Watson, getting a 
definitive big play to point to as a 
mark of how far he has come in 
his career. And that was evident 
after Watson’s interception.
As 
he 
sprinted 
into 
the 
endzone, Watson didn’t stop, 
jogging all the way across the 
field and back to the sideline, 
where he was mobbed and 
knocked over by his teammates, 
eager to celebrate a pick-six that 
meant more for sideline spirits 
than it meant for the outcome of 
the game.

Patterson’s mobility keys season-high passing performance vs. Maryland

The Michigan football team 
separates its offense into three 
groups to tailor its strength 
and 
conditioning 
program: 
linemen, small skill — running 
backs and receivers — and big 
skill for quarterbacks and tight 
ends.
But those categories don’t 
hold 
for 
Shea 
Patterson. 
Throughout 
his 
time 
with 
the 
Wolverines, 
the 
junior 
quarterback has drilled with 
those shiftier players, working 
to match their speed and 
agility.
“Except 
for 
the 
long 
distance, I stay with the big 
skill (for that),” Patterson said.
Saturday, that work showed. 
Patterson made plays with his 
feet 
throughout 
Michigan’s 
victory over Maryland, helping 
him throw for a season-high 282 
yards and three touchdowns on 
19-of-27 passing.
That 
included 
some 
of 
Patterson’s 
most 
impressive 
plays to date. At the end of 
the second quarter, he flashed 
shades of one of his quarterback 
idols, 2012 Heisman Trophy 
Winner Johnny Manziel.
Working from just beyond 

the redzone, Patterson faked 
the handoff, sprinted out to 
his left and saw nothing. Then, 
like a shortstop turning a 
double-play with a baserunner 
incoming, Patterson whipped it 
into coverage with a Terrapin 
in his face. And just as another 
Maryland 
player 
looked 
to 
be in position to make the 
interception, 
Ronnie 
Bell 
flashed across field to take 
it away. Six yards and a dive 
later, the freshman receiver 
and Patterson had their first 
touchdown connection.
The throw required courage 
— Patterson was drilled after 
releasing — creativity and risk.
“He 
does 
some 
amazing 
things out there on the field,” 
said sophomore center Cesar 
Ruiz. “Having him make those 
kind of plays — improvise when 
things get crazy and make a 
play out of it — it’s just amazing 
to have someone like that lead 
our offense.”
Patterson 
also 
channeled 
that improvisation ability on 
his second score.
Down thirteen a quarter 
later, Maryland blitzed and got 
a free rusher in the backfield 
almost 
immediately. 
But 
Patterson spun backwards — 
a “whirlybird” as Michigan 

coach Jim Harbaugh called 
it — to escape the pocket. 
Most quarterbacks would’ve 
quit there — rolling to the 
left 
17 
yards 
behind 
the 
line of scrimmage is not an 
advantageous position.
But for not Patterson.
Quickly refocusing his eyes 
downfield, he completed to a 
wide-open Donovan Peoples-
Jones, 
who 
scampered 
the 
remaining 
distance 
for 
a 
34-yard score.
“He’s a dynamic player,” said 
senior running back Karon 
Hidgon. “We’ve seen him make 
plays like that time and time 
again since he’s been here. … 
It’s not a shocker to us.
“He’s able to pick his feet up, 
put them down, get out of tight 
windows — he does a heck of a 
job.”
Though 
it 
wasn’t 
the 
same kind of high-level play, 
Patterson utilized his mobility 
on his third touchdown, too. 
On play-action with first-and-
goal in the fourth quarter, 
Patterson ran to the right and 
slipped a touchdown pass to 
junior fullback Jared Wangler.
It was the type of play 
Harbaugh couldn’t have run 
with previous quarterbacks. 
Jake 
Rudock 
and 
Wilton 

Speight were both defined by 
what they could do within the 
pocket rather than outside of it. 
 
But Patterson’s legs give 
Michigan another element. 
“He’s really good when he 
gets outside of the pocket,” 
Harbaugh 
said. 
“Really 
dangerous throwing on the 
run, seeing the field or running 
himself. It’s a real weapon. He’s 
really growing and playing 

better and better every week. 
He throws really well in the 
pocket when he has (time), and 
when he has to, he’s got a real 
knack — great peripheral vision 
(or) sensation — of where to be 
in the pocket.”
Patterson was also effective 
there. He unloaded a 51-yard 
bomb to sophomore receiver 
Nico Collins in the second 
quarter before finding People-

Jones for another deep strike 
— though the latter was called 
back after a holding penalty.
Patterson won’t always have 
that kind of time. Saturday, 
however, Patterson showed he 
doesn’t always need it to still 
be dangerous. 
“It was players making plays 
today,” Harbaugh said. “That’s 
really what I saw — starting 
with Shea.”

Injuries mounting for Wolverines 
ahead of toughest games this year

The 
No. 
15 
Wisconsin 
football team’s offensive line 
is good. Like, really good. 
It allows just 1.6 sacks per 
game. On the ground, running 
back and Heisman contender 
Jonathan Taylor ranks third 
in the country in rushing with 
141.5 yards per game, 6.7 per 
carry.
Michigan’s 
defense has rarely 
met a challenge 
too 
tall. 
But 
next 
Saturday, 
the 
12th-ranked 
Wolverines might 
be facing a steep 
climb 
against 
its 
toughest 
competition yet.
Late 
in 
the 
second 
quarter 
Saturday against Maryland, 
defensive 
tackle 
Michael 
Dwumfour went to the ground 
after awkwardly planting his 
right foot attacking a run play. 
The entire team surrounded 
the redshirt sophomore on 
the field offering words of 
encouragement before he was 
carted off the field.
Junior 
linebacker 
Devin 
Bush Jr. said he believed 
Dwumfour just rolled his 
ankle. Michigan Coach Jim 
Harbaugh 
said 
it’s 
to 
be 
determined and that the team 
is evaluating the injury.
While Dwumfour’s health 
status is currently unknown, 
he reassuringly tweeted after 
the game: “I’m good thanks 
for the support.”
With less than five minutes 
remaining in the game, junior 
defensive tackle Carlo Kemp 
also limped off the field 
with an apparent injury and 
unknown condition.
“Still 
evaluating,” 
Harbaugh said.
With an already-thinned 
out 
defense, 
an 
adaptive 

mindset has become requisite.
“There has been a couple 
bang-ups 
on 
the 
D-line,” 
said junior VIPER Khaleke 
Hudson. “But we just trust 
the backups to come in and do 
what they gotta do and work 
hard and get the job done. The 
linebackers are doing what 
we’ve gotta do and the safeties 
counter off of that.”
Added 
Bush: 
“It 
just 
encourages me to get those 
guys ready to play at a high 
level.”
Junior 
defensive 
end 
Rashan 
Gary 
also 
sat 
out 
Saturday’s 
contest as a 
precaution. 
The 
junior 
had 
been 
playing 
through 
apparent AC joint pain in his 
right shoulder this season. 
According to Harbaugh, he 
made the decision to give Gary 
time to rehabilitate ahead 
of the daunting three-game 
stretch, noting “it’s not a long-
term thing.”
And sophomore 
defensive 
tackle 
Aubrey 
Solomon 
has 
been 
out 
since 
the 
start 
of 
the 
season 
recovering 
from 
knee 
surgery. 
But 
Harbaugh 
offered a positive 
assessment of his 
improvement.
“Aubrey, 
we’ll 
see,” 
Harbaugh said. “He had a 
good week last week, we’ll see 
how close he is this week.”
Despite the carousel of 
injuries, the Wolverines still 
rank first in the country in 
total defense, allowing just 
230.5 yards and 15.8 points per 
game. The available playing 
time has fallen squarely on 
players like Kwity Paye and 

Josh Uche. The pair combined 
for 
four 
sacks 
last 
week 
against Nebraska.
Stellar 
play, 
of 
course, 
doesn’t 
perfectly 
replicate 
what the defensive production 
could have been fully healthy. 
But the amenable defensive 
front has been nothing to balk 
at.
On the offensive side, junior 
running back Chris Evans was 
also benched as a safeguard. 
Evans is still recovering from 
an apparent leg injury.
“Yeah, Chris practiced two 
days this week, and ultimately 
thought it best not to … play 
him today,” Harbaugh said. 
“Hopefully we get some guys 
back next week.”
Wide receiver Tarik Black, 
who has yet to play this season 
after suffering a broken foot 
for the second consecutive 
season, also remains out, but 
has been out of a walking 
boot for a few weeks. News 
on Black’s health should be 
expected soon.
“Yeah, he’s rehabbing well,” 
Harbaugh said on Oct. 1. “His 
doctor will be coming into 
town when the Packers play 
the 
Lions 
on 
October 
7. 
I 
think 
he’s 
got 
a 
scheduled 
appointment 
then to look 
at it. Could 
have 
some 
good 
news 
at that point. 
Things look 
really 
good 
the way it’s progressing.”
It’s 
all 
speculation 
at 
this point, but Harbaugh’s 
diagnoses and the severity 
of recent injuries point to 
a healthier lineup in the 
coming weeks. And with three 
consecutive matchups against 
ranked conference opponents 
coming 
up, 
Michigan 
will 
anxiously 
await 
that 
possibility.

A stumble and a scrimmage

Unlike Friday night, the result 
of Sunday’s game was not in 
question for very long.
The Michigan hockey team 
(0-1) took the ice at Yost Ice Arena 
for the second time in as many 
days. After losing to Vermont, 
5-2, in their season opener, the 
Wolverines looked to rebound 
in an exhibition match against 
Waterloo.
And rebound is just what they 
did.
Michigan’s offense wasted no 
time as sophomore forward Josh 
Norris streaked towards the net on 
the right side of the ice and tucked 
the puck under the crossbar and 
over goaltender Trevor Martin’s 
left shoulder. After going scoreless 
in their previous 50 minutes of 
play, the Wolverines were finally 
on the board.
Just three minutes later, junior 
forward Nick Pastujov extended 
the lead to 2-0 after he found 
space in front of the net on a pass 
from the left wing off the stick of 

junior forward Jake Slaker. The 
goal came during a four-on-three 
advantage for Michigan.
The Wolverines would pour in 
two more goals in the first period 
and entered the first intermission 
with a 4-1 lead.
In 
addition 
to 
the 
early 
offensive 
initiative, 
freshman 
goaltender Strauss Mann made 
his debut for the Wolverines. His 
collegiate career got off to a less-
than-ideal start after a shot from 
center ice bounced towards the 
goal and over his left pad. After 
allowing Waterloo on the board 
seven minutes into the contest, 
the freshman settled in and 
looked more comfortable in the 
crease.
His aggressive style showed 
as he often came out of the net 
to play the puck, allowing his 
team to quickly transition on 
the offensive break. Michigan’s 
29 shots on target through the 
first two periods were a result of 
its aggressiveness starting from 
the back and the effective puck 
movement in the offensive zone.
The Wolverines added three 

more goals in the second period 
on goals from junior forward Will 
Lockwood, freshman forward 
Jack Olmstead and sophomore 
forward Jack Becker.
Olmstead, 
who 
made 
his 
collegiate 
debut, 
impressed 
Michigan coach Mel Pearson.
“[Olmstead] didn’t play last 
night, but he got in there tonight,” 
Pearson said. “He played strong, 
he played hard and he had a nice 
goal.”
Added Pearson: “I like this 
class, and I’m really looking 
forward to seeing the growth in 
them.”
Nine of out 10 members of the 
freshman class have now made 
their debuts for the Wolverines, 
with the only exception being 
goaltender Jack Leavy.
Despite sloppy play from the 
Wolverines towards the end of 
the game, the early lead created a 
margin for error. Waterloo scored 
the only goal in the third frame, 
but the four-goal deficit coming 
into the final period of play proved 
to be insurmountable as Michigan 
bounced back from its loss on 
Saturday, notching a 7-4 win.
Although the Wolverines came 
out on top, they allowed nine goals 
through their first two games. 
Pearson acknowledged that it 
is something his team needs to 
address moving forward.
“We’ve 
got 
to 
get 
better 
defensively,” Pearson said. “Even 
tonight, four goals is too many 
… We’ve got to get better in that 
area. I’m a little surprised that 
we’re not better –– that we gave 
up as many goals as we did this 
weekend. So that’s going to be an 
area that we have to take care of.”
Michigan will get another 
chance to make its defensive 
adjustments in an exhibition 
match on Friday against USA 
Hockey’s U-18 National Team 
Development 
Program 
before 
returning to regular season play 
against Western Michigan on Oct. 
19.

No. 4 Michigan falls to Vermont in season-opener, 5-2
Wolverines rebound for exhibition win over Waterloo

KATELYN MULCAHY/Daily
Sophomore forward Jack Becker scored one of Michigan’s three second-period goals in its exhibition win on Sunday.

As senior right wing Will 
Lockwood glided around the 
right circle at the 3:30 mark of 
the second period, there was a 
moment, albeit a brief one, where 
there was nothing but clear ice 
between he and his second goal 
of the game.
Lockwood sized up the puck 
and hesitated, but by the time 
he 
was 
ready 
to 
shoot, 
the 
Catamounts had 
already 
taken 
possession. Once 
again, 
Vermont 
had 
pulled 
the 
rug 
out 
from 
under the No. 4 
Michigan hockey 
team.
In 
the 
Wolverines’ 
season-opening 5-2 loss against 
the Catamounts, they found 
themselves 
constantly 
trying 
to fight back from Vermont’s 
sucker punches. Right away, 
Michigan couldn’t establish itself 
on offense; for the most part the 
Catamounts closed off all the 
passing lanes in the middle of the 
ice for the Wolverines, forcing 
Michigan to bring up its backline 
to kickstart an offensive flow.
“We wanted to play fast,” 
said senior defenseman Joseph 
Cecconi. “Our team is fast, we 
want to move the puck fast, and in 
the first period, we were moving 
a little slow, not physical. Coach 
[Pearson] came in the locker room 
and asked us to move the puck 
quicker and take more shots.”
Just like that Vermont, made 
them pay — twice. Four minutes 
into the game, the Wolverines 
faced a 2-0 deficit, off two goals 
— one of them on a powerplay — 
from Catamounts forward Alex 
Esposito. Four minutes into the 
season, Michigan was in trouble 
against a team that went 10-20-7 

last year.
“We weren’t ready to play 
tonight,” said Michigan coach 
Mel Pearson. “I think we came in 
here with the mindset that it was 
going to be easy, and that we’d 
score ten goals on them.”
As one does when punched 
in 
the 
mouth, 
though, 
the 
Wolverines punched back as hard 
as they could. Five minutes later, 
Michigan earned a power play 
of its own. Using their newfound 
open 
ice, 
the 
Wolverines 
finally 
found 
some 
room 
to 
breathe, 
whirring 
the 
puck 
around 
to 
the 
top 
of 
the 
right 
circle to a calm 
and 
waiting 
Lockwood. 
As 
Lockwood 
prepared his slapshot, sophomore 
left 
wing 
Michael 
Pastujov 
screened off Vermont goaltender 
Stefanos 
Lekkas, 
rendering 
Lockwood’s shot-— and goal — 
effectively invisible to Lekkos. 
Just 58 seconds later, junior left 
wing Jake Slaker careened a shot 
gloveside, and junior defenseman 
Nick 
Pastujov 
flicked it in.
“I 
think 
we 
need to be a lot 
better at getting 
the puck from our 
defensive 
zone 
into the offensive 
zone,” 
Nick 
Pastujov said. “As 
you can see, once 
you spend a lot of 
time down there 
that’s when you get five or six 
shots in a shift.”
Vermont, though, pulled the 
same trick that the Wolverines 
did at the end of the period, 
using a screener to clear the 
way for a goal by forward Max 
Kaufman. Michigan outshot the 

Catamounts through the first 
period and the second period, 
but the Wolverines constantly 
fumbled passes and fell back into 
the same disjointed offense that 
plagued them at the start of the 
game.
This time, Michigan didn’t 
claw back. With three minutes 
remaining in the final period, 
Vermont 
put 
the game away 
for good on a 
close-range 
shot 
by 
left 
wing 
Martin 
Frechette 
and 
rubbed 
in the wound 
with 
another 
goal 
with 
18 
seconds left in 
regulation.
For all of the Wolverines’ sky-
high expectations and hopes 
coming into the season, the 
Catamounts hit them with a 
dose of reality. Time will tell if 
Michigan can come up with the 
response that it couldn’t find 
today.

Defensive effort difference in weekend performances for ‘M’

It’s funny how different a 
narrative can be when a team 
allows four goals in back-to-
back games.
You have a sloppy blue line 
that didn’t put enough effort — 
didn’t make those hustle plays. 
And you have a high-intensity, 
defensive match with a few bad 
bounces.
The difference? Well, it’s just 
that. The defensive intensity 
and effort.
It’s hard to justify giving 
up four goals in any game. 
Especially not from this veteran 
group 
of 
Michigan 
hockey 
defensemen 
that 
teammates 
have dubbed one of the best in 
the nation.
But 
after 
the 
weekend 
passed, with the fourth-ranked 
Wolverines dropping four goals 
and an empty-netter to lose 5-2 
to Vermont and bouncing back 
for a 7-4, exhibition-game win 
against Waterloo, it became 
much easier to justify one than 
the other.
And not because one mattered 
and one didn’t.
In Friday’s matchup against 
the Catamounts, it was evident 
the hustle wasn’t there for the 
Michigan 
defense. 
Multiple 
times, 
the 
blueliners 
had 
possession of the puck in the 
offensive 
zone 
with 
little 
pressure put on them but would 
let the possession go to waste 
by accidentally pushing it into 
neutral ice — forcing a reset.
“I thought we weren’t ready 
to play tonight,” said Michigan 
coach Mel Pearson after Friday’s 
game. “We weren’t really ready 
to play.”
Pearson 
made 
sure 
to 
emphasize “ready” the second 
time. Because it was as clear 
to him as it was clear to 
everyone else watching that 
the Wolverines had expected a 
cakewalk.
“I think we came into today 
with the mindset thinking it was 
going to be easy,” Pearson said. 
“I just didn’t like our stuff.”
On the defensive end, the 
Michigan 
defensemen, 
like 

sophomore 
Quinn 
Hughes, 
gambled on the puck, leaving 
odd-man 
rushes 
if 
their 
interception 
attempt 
went 
astray, putting junior goaltender 
Hayden 
Lavigne 
in 
tricky 
situations.
The Wolverines flipped the 
script the next day, though.
“Happy with today,” Pearson 
said. “Got a little sloppy at times, 
coming off a tough loss last 
night and a quick turnaround, 
you expected some of that.”
Coming out 4-1 after the 1st 
period, the Wolverines kicked 
the defensive gears into place. 
They put good pressure on the 
puck, preventing any dangerous 
situations. The one goal that 
Waterloo scored was from a bad 
bounce off a neutral-ice slapper, 

a puck freshman goaltender 
Strauss Mann would want back 
— but only partially.
“(Mann) laughing a little bit 
after the game,” Pearson said. “I 
think he’d like to have a couple 
back, he fell over a little bit at 
the end.”
The job for Mann became 
much easier with the increased 
defensive 
intensity. 
Late 
in 
the second period, freshman 
defenseman 
Jake 
Gingell 
dove for a loose puck in the 
offensive zone, sacrificing his 
body — which got sandwiched 
between a Warrior and the 
boards. It wasn’t a necessary 
play by any means. Michigan 
had a comfortable lead in a 
meaningless game, but it was the 
type of play that Gingell needed 

to make after the blueline’s poor 
showing Friday night.
Of course, in the latter half 
of the game, that intensity and 
effort that was the difference-
maker disappeared. As Pearson 
noted, exhibition games are 
hard to play. When stats don’t 
count, when there’s not a lot on 
the line, intensity falls.
“We freelanced too much. We 
got a little bit sloppy,” Pearson 
said “ … And it’s a fine line. 
Just intensity, You lose your 
intensity, and things sort of just 
shut down for you.”
But that didn’t stop some 
players 
from 
making 
plays. 
In the middle of the third 
period, sophomore center Josh 
Norris had a careless turnover, 
accidentally tapping the puck to 

neutral ice with no one back.
It became a scramble for 
the puck, and the first one to 
reach it was a Waterloo player. 
But not far behind was senior 
defenseman Nicholas Boka. His 
hustle prevented a two-on-none 
situation, instead forcing the 
Warriors to reset the offensive 
push — giving time for all 
the players to return to the 
defensive zone.
“We have guys who can 
score,” Pearson said. “That’s not 
going to be an issue this year. 
We have enough guys who can 
score. We just have to continue 
to play on the right side of the 
puck.
“That’s my biggest concern. 
The goal scoring will come. If 
you’re forced to have to score 

five, it gets difficult. If you give 
up four goals, it gets tough to 
score five.”
Again, 
it’s 
funny 
the 
difference in narratives after 
games have been played. The 
question everyone posed before 
the season began was where the 
scoring production would come 
from after the “DMC” line — 
the top line responsible for 124 
of the 365 points Wolverines 
produced last season — had
