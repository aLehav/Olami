Yale professor
discusses issues of
2010 Supreme
Court case
By NEALA BERKOWSKI
For the Daily
University alum Heather
Gerken, a law professor at Yale
University, spoke about issues
related to the historic Supreme
Court case Citizens United v.
Federal Election Commission
case to more than 100 attendees.
The 2010 case granted corpora-
tions the financial rights of indi-

viduals in regards to campaign
finance, "dark money" and shad-
ow parties.
Undergraduate and gradu-
ate students in the Ford School
of Public Policy, students from
the Law School and community
members were among those in
attendance for Gerken's three-
part presentation.
In the first section, Gerken
offered a brief history of cam-
paign finance reform. She
argued that Citizens United
plays an important role in the
relationship between indepen-
dent spending and corruption.
Later, she explained how the
court's decision may push the,
party system toward one domi-

nated by powerful "shadow par-
ties." Gerken added that "shadow
parties" risk undermine the
influence of the "party faith-
ful," who connect party elites to
everyday citizens.
Audience memberswere given
notecards to write down ques-
tions and people watching a live
stream of the event tweeted their
questions at the Ford School.
"I have to say (the Ford stu-
dents) asked fantastic questions,
and I have a lot of hats," Gerken
said before the event. "I've
been an elections lawyer for
the Obama campaign, I've done
reform work, and they had good
questions on pretty much every
topic. And for me this stuff is like

popcorn, so I'm happy to munch
along."
"She is an important voice in
the field and the topic was inter-
esting," Rackham student Conor
McKay said. "The more that
people know about these issues,
understand these issues and can
hear what's in the media and get
a sense of what they're actually
talking about, the better."
After the lecture, a reception
was held outside the auditorium
to allow students, faculty and
community members to eat and
continue the conversation.
"I thought it was very
thought-provoking," Rackham
student Dana Sherry said. "I was

'U' receives low
course evaluation
rates since switch to
online platform
By YARDAIN AMRON
Daily StaffReporter
At the University, course and
teacher evaluations are deemed
vital to both administration and
faculty, but often neglected by
the students who fill them out.
The data itself is kept in-house,
locked away at the Office of the
Registrar, and the response rates
are low compared to other uni-
versities.
However, for faculty, student
evaluations can mean the dif-
ference between depositing a
paycheck and dipping into emer-
gency funds.
"Turns out there are pretty
high stakes for us," Political Sci-
ence Prof. Mika LaVaque-Manty
said. "(Evaluations) are involved
in promotion, for GSI's in terms of
retention and for lecturers - who
are judged purely on the basis of
their contribution to teaching -
they literally may be a matter of
job or no job."
When faculty members in line

for promotion are assessed by
their respective departments,
student evaluations play a large
role in the decision. Deborah
Loewenberg Ball, dean of the
School of Education, said student
evaluations weigh heavily on the
whole portfolio and influence the
committee's ultimate decision.
"You can't get promoted at this
University if you have bad teach-
ing evaluations," Ball said. "You
could be a great researcher, you
could be doing all types of things
professionally, but if your course
evaluations are poor, and there's
evidence that your teaching isn't
good, you won't get promoted."
However the data suggests
students aren't as invested in the
process. In the 2012'fall semes-
ter, only56 percent of all students
responded to course evaluation
surveys. For the past few years,
the rate has been treading just
slightly above 50 percent.
Two factors may explain the
low response: the University's
transition frompaper toelectron-
ic evaluations in 2008, and a lack
of incentive for students to take
the time to fillthem out.
Before the 2008 winter term,
evaluations were filled out on
paper and administered in class,

STUDENT GOVERNMENT
CSG seeks to
investigate the
Gibbons case

Proppe signs
executive order to
establish task force
for further probing
By MICHAEL SUGERMAN
Daily StaffReporter
Late Monday evening, the
Central Student Government
has created an executive task-
force to examine the University's
relativelynewsexual misconduct
policy and review its implemen-
tation in Brendan Gibbons' per-
manent seperation.
According to documents
reviewed by The Michigan Daily,
Gibbons was permanently sepa-
rated from the University in late
December after being found
responsible for a 2009 violation
of the Student Sexual Miscon-
duct Policy.
Business senior Michael
Proppe, CSG president, signed
an executive order Monday night
establishing the taskforce to
probe into actions taken by the
office of Student Conflict Reso-
lution in Gibbons' case.
"Following The Daily's arti-
cles, there was a lot of confu-
sion among students and across
the entire University commu-
nity about how exactly this new

sexual misconduct policy works,
and how it works with respect to
cases that took place under the
old policy," Proppe said.
The University changed its
sexual misconduct policy in
September 2013, shifting from a
complaint-driven model to one
propelled by University investi-
gators.
Law student Jeremy Keeney,
CSG student general counsel,
said the University now pursues
all cases of sexual misconduct
regardless of whether or not the
victim desires an investigation.
"The old policy is more sexual
assault-based and the new policy
broadens that to sexual miscon-
duct," Keeney said. "So it seems
that there may be things that are
included in the new policy that
weren't in the old one."
Proppe added that the Uni-
versity's policy in 2009--the
year Gibbons allegedly violated
the code of conduct--required
"clear and convincing evidence"
to take action, whereas the 2013
policy seeks "preponderance of
evidence." He added that this is a
"much lower standard."
one of the taskforce's goals is
to determine which policy was
applied in Gibbons' removal from
the University. Others include
inquiring as to whether or not
oSCR delayed the investigation

Construction of
controversial oil
route may endanger
environment
By AMABEL KAROUB
Daily StaffReporter
"Stop the pipeline!"
The chant resounded across
East Liberty Street and South
5th Avenue on. Monday night,
when more than 20 students
and Ann Arbor locals peti-

tioned the construction of the
Keystone XL pipeline, an oil
line expected to cause hazard-
ous environmental effects.
The protest took place out-
side of the Ann Arbor Fed-
eral Building. It was one of
many united KXL protests
that occurred throughout the
country supported by CREDO,
National Rainforest Network,
the Sierra Club, 350.org and a
number of other associations
dedicated to environmental
conservation.
KXL is a proposed 1,179-
mile pipeline that will trans-

port up to 830,000 barrels
of oil per day from Alberta,
Canada to the Gulf of Mexico,
traveling through multiple U.S.
states.
Protestors gathered in
response to the U.S. Depart-
ment of State's Final Supple-
mental Environmental Impact
Statement regarding KXL,
which was released Friday.
Many of the protestors believe
this statement invited presi-
dential approval of construc-
tion.

Centralized standards of practice
focus of Senate Assembly meetin

Concerns over
Athletic Department
background checks
discussed
By ANDREW ALMANI
Daily Staff Reporter
The Senate Advisory Commit-
tee on University Affairs spent
much of its meeting Monday
afternoon in private executive
session, discussing a range of
policy issues with guests.
The first topic of the execu-
tive session was the Univer-
sity's Standard Practice Guide
on minors. With the consider-
able number of students who
are minors on campus, the Uni-
versity is looking to examine its
policy and identify any necessary
adjustments.
The University consolidated
its policies in January into a
more centralized one. The new
measure makes background

checks mandatory for employees
working with children.
In October 2013, University
President Mary Sue Coleman
addressed the safety of minors
at a SACUA meeting, taking into
consideration the sexual abuse
scandal of children at Pennsylva-
nia State University.
"Every department probably
engages with minors in some
way on campus, so it's obviously
a tough situation," Coleman said.
There was some concern after
a panel found that the Univer-
sity Athletic Department failed
to perform national-level back-
ground checks for employees
of summer camps. Coleman
assured the committee that
background checks are consis-
tently performed.
At a meeting at the Univer-
sity's athletic campus in Sep-
tember 2013, Athletic Campus
Administrator Katie Miranto
was concerned about how the
program handled its background
check policies.
"I can't even describe to you

how many gaps there are and
how nervous I get over the sum-
mer,"Miranto said in September.
"It's very hard to sleep."
Kate Rychlinski, assistant
director of risk management;
Paul Moggach, director of risk
management; Kelly Cunning-
ham, director of public affairs
and Assistant General Counsel
Donica Varner joined SACUA to
discuss these policies.
Other matters in executive
session included SACUA Nomi-
nations, the Honorary Degree
Selection Committee and the
University Secretary.
The Committee also dis-
cussed the approval of a nomi-
nation form for new SACUA
members. SACUA Chair Karen
Staller urged members to nomi-
nate friends and colleagues they
believe would perform well in
the needed roles.
Instead of going to its sched-
uled meeting in Dearborn next
week, SACUA members decided
to have their usual meeting at the
University.

had to submit to the survey. This
led to a relatively high response
rate, with 71.5 percent participa-
tion in the 2008 winter semester.
When the University moved the
entire evaluation system online,
they were moved out of the class-
room. With students expected to
fill the surveys out on their own
time, response rates dropped 10
points, to about 61 percent in fall
2008.
While the rate has increased
since 2009, the web survey has
remained at about 15 to 20 per-
centage points below that of the
paper version. Experts on such
evaluations cite 70 percent as an
ideal response rate. A lower rate
will threaten reliability.
LaVaque-Manty said the golden
number is not the rate, but the
size of the class. In his research,
he compared the evaluations of a
specific course between consecu-
tive years and found correlation,
but only in large classes with
more than 50 students. In smaller
classes, evaluations fluctuated
significantly year-to-year. A good
rating one year could be followed
by a poor rating the next. Teacher
evaluations were not reliably mea-
suring teacher quality in small
classes, and a high response rate
made no difference.
"Think about all those grad
students teaching English 125. It's
18 students and it's a total crap-
shoot," he said.
Of more concern is the empha-
sis a review committee places on
such comparative data.
The faculty promotion guide-
lines, state that "comparative data
is particularly helpful."
However, when students click
submit, they never again see their
answers or those of their peers,
and can forget it in light of loom-
ing finals. This contrasts many
other colleges, where students feel
compelled to thoroughly complete
evaluations because they can also
directly profit or potentially suffer
consequences.
At Harvard University, stu-
dents are given access to evalu-
ation data through the Q-Guide,
a list of every course offered -
accompanied with compehen-
sive graphs, pie-charts and past
student evaluations - to ease
their "shopping" of courses and
teachers.
"It's worth it to take the time
to fill it out," Harvard sophomore
Hannah Firestone said. "If you're
going to complain about a class,
youshould participate in the effort
to give that class feedback, and if
you really liked a class, you should
participate in the effort to keep
that class popular."

As further motivation, Har-
vard withholds grades during a
designated period to encourage
participation in filling out course
evaluations. The sooner students
complete their evaluations, the
sooner grades are returned.
Though she admitted coercion
might not be the best enticement,
Firestone said the higher response
rates are worth it.
Northwestern University takes
a slightly less involved approach.
Instead of withholding grades,
students who don't fill out the
surveys are denied access to
evaluation data for the upcoming
quarter.
Alison Phillips, assistant reg-
istrar at Northwestern, said that
since the incentive was introduced
in 2004, the student response rate
has been a steady 70 percent each
quarter.
In a December interview, Uni-
versity Provost Martha Pollack
said the University was not in
favor of using coercive methods to
increase response rates.
"We don't want to coerce stu-
dents, but we want to encourage
them to submit evaluations," Pol-
lack said.
LaVaque-Manty said the Uni-
versity has interpreted Michigan
law in a way that bars it fromwith-
holding educational records. But
Michigan State University, which
is also under the jurisdiction of
state law, withholds grades until
students either fill out evaluations
or decline via checkbox. MSU also
publishes limited course evalua-
tion data through a separate sur-
vey.
At the University, the admin-
istration has placed the respon-
sibility on students to keep
evaluation data public and up-to-
date. Between2003 and2011itwas
housed on a Central Student Gov-
ernment website, Advice Online,
which is no longer in operation.
CSG President Michael Proppe,
a Business senior, said he wasn't
directly involved in the site and
was unsure exactly why it no lon-
ger exists.
"It's either that the Registrar's
Office is not providing the data,
or somewhere there's a broken
link, and whoever in CSG was
responsible for keeping that data,
either left or stopped doing their
work and didn't have a successor,"
Proppe said.
Engineering senior Kyle Sum-
mers, former CSG chief of staff,
was given control of Advice
Online in 2009 and quickly real-
ized much of the site was unhelp-
ful and feared some data might be
misrepresented.
"The interface looked really
outdated," Summers said. "I
would say it was below par, rela-
tive to even our course guide right
now, which could arguably use a
lot of improvements."

While CSG planned to launch
before winter 2014 despite a new
Advice Online in the works, Sum-
mers said that he doesn't believe
anyone is working on it as far as he
knows.
Either way, LaVaque-Manty
said it should not be the onus of
students to publicize the data.
Without public evaluations,
many students at the University
turn to third-party course evalu-
ation sites, such as RateMyProfes-
sors.com.
The site depends solely on
student contribution and, so far,
students have input 3,714 faculty
members and 349 campus ratings,
which rate the school as a whole.
Michigan State University stu-
dents, in comparison, have input
1,333 faculty members, and 164
campus ratings.
The University ranks 10th in
number of campus ratings among
4,564 schools on the site with at
least one rating.
LaVaque-Manty, with the help
of a graduate student, matched
700 professor ratings from
RateMyProfessors with their
respective University student
evaluations and overlaid the
results. To the surprise of critics,
he found sufficient correlation
between ratings of the two evalu-
ation systems.
But his more startling finding
came when he added the noto-
rious RateMyProfessors chili
pepper into the equation, which
students award to teachers they
deem attractive. While students
may assume the chili is just a
silly pepper, LaVaque-Manty's
research shows it might be a spic-
ier indicator than students think.
"The professor who doesn't
have a chili pepper has to be
almost as easy as the hardest
professor who has a chili pepper
to get the same quality rating,"
LaVaque-Manty said.
Faculty with a chili pepper are
more than likely have pretty good
student evaluation scores, while
those without a pepper may or
may not have good scores.
His theory is that the chili is
not just a measure of "hotness,"
but also of rapport - a teacher's
emotional respect, empathy and
consideration for the student.
"They might be Ryan Gos-
ling or Jennifer Lawrence,
but if they're mean, you likely
won't give them a chili pepper,"
LaVaque-Manty said.
Finding a first-rate solution to
such a complex issue will nothap-
pen overnight, but the University
maintains that it's working on it.

Kelly Cunningham wrote in a
statement that "the University

the polar vortex this past month,
EMUused its notification system for

"We don't use all the systems for

those notifications," Wesley said.
"We'll do the campus e-mails and

Susan Smith, associate profes-

"Universities started to more
systematically look at ways to alert
students and that's when they put in
abort systems that will help either
text you or send you a telephone

Because many universities across

The program will include
a large lecture course open to
undergraduate and graduate stu-
dents on urbanism, urban issues
and egalitarianism in architec-
ture. It will also involve two small
seminar courses focused on post-
industrial cities experiencing a
decline in population, as well as
growing Latin and South Ameri-
can cities like Mexico City and
Rio de Janeiro.
"Urban designers and archi-
tects are designing spaces and
buildings in urban areas for a
variety of people," Curry said.
"The challenge is how to deliver
the work for that client but also to
recognize that your building and
your project sits within a larger
context in which part of it will be
seen, if not used, by the general
public."
The program will incorporate
informal events where students

and faculty will come together to
discuss different topics covered in
the classroom their work. There
will also be an annual symposium
that will bring in faculty from the
University and outside experts to
talk about relevant topics.
If the program is successful,
Curry said the college will seek
"continuance funding" from the
Mellon Foundation to continue its
progress after its first four years.
"In my mind, by bringing
together the depth of humanity of
scholarship with a secular knowl-
edge of design, the Mellon grant
represents a major step forward
in refraining how we think about
urbanism," Architecture Prof.
Monica Ponce de Leon said.
The University will showcase
exhibitions featuring the work of
architectural designers and stu-
dents studying the humanities
on campus and in the Museum of
Contemporary Art Detroit.
The program will also offer
four four-year postgraduate
fellowships. Two candidates
will be selected to teach in a
new architecture preparation
course for high school students
in Detroit, and two others will
teach the large lecture course
offered through the new grant
program.
At the end of the four-and-
a-half years, a large book will be
produced featuring the work of
people who have participated in
the program, along with other
scholars and designers from out-
side of the program.

Student-athletes deserve a voice
The NCAA needs to listen to and address the concerns of athletes
n an attempt to give student-athletes a collective voice, players at
Northwestern University have filed paperwork to form a player's
union under the National Labor Relations Board. The group, called
the College Athletes Players Association, has outlined 11 goals in order to
improve the safety and future of college athletes. The NCAA completely
disregarded the players' requests, noting that student-athletes are not
employees by any definition and therefore have no rights to collectively
bargain. However, Northwestern's players pose legitimate demands
regarding the well-being of student-athletes. The NCAA must work
alongside college athletes to find a better way to address these concerns.

The players' stated goals aren't central-
ized on pay-to-play schemes but instead are
more reasonable: increased attention to inju-
ries, scholarship guarantees and allowing
student-athletes freedom for employment
or other commercial opportunities. Better
benefits in education and healthcare would
greatly enhance the quality of a student-ath-
lete's time in college and beyond. The union
would give the players the means necessary
to communicate with the NCAA regarding
these issues, but the NCAA continues to shut
the players out. Thus, the decision rests with
the NLRB and the court systems.
The NCAA made $71 million in surplus
revenue during the 2012 fiscal year with $872
million in total revenue. The University of
Michigan's projected budget for 2013-14 was
$137.5 million, with a projected $8.9 million
in surplus. Student-athletes are being used to
generate these large profits, and deserve a col-
lective say. The NCAA claims player participa-
tion is voluntary, however, college level sports
often serve as the only stepping-stone for ath-
letes pursuing a professional career. Even for
athletes not planning on playing at the next
level, scholarships are often a necessary means
of paying for a post-secondary education.
In college sports, injury concerns are
extremely prevalent, especially in football,

with recent attention surrounding the many
cases of chronic traumatic encephalopathy
in players. Concussion treatment is a seri-
ous issue with CTE leading to effects such as
memory loss, confusion, impaired judgment,
depression and aggressive behavior. An orga-
nized voice is necessary to guarantee long-
term care for injured players.
Student-athlete scholarships themselves
are not even a guarantee. Up until an August
2011 vote by Division I schools, universities
couldn't offer scholarships that would last
longer than one year. However, since then
only six schools in the major athletic confer-
ences signed more than 24 multi-year schol-
arships. Scholarships that aren't multi-year
must be renewed each successive year, creat-
ing a situation where student-athletes have
no protection for their futures.
Student-athletes have long been refused a
seat at the table in the matters that concern
them most. Issues such as medical care and
scholarships, as well as other pressing issues
such as whether to increase stipends to cover
the full cost of attendance to prevent what

After all, I'm white and from a small

Powerful ideas and lasting change

Award season is well underway this win-
ter; the Golden Globes and the Screen Actors
Guild Awards have come and gone. The
eagerly anticipated list of Oscar nominations
has been released. There are some incredibly
interesting and well-done films on the list of
nominations for these award shows. Some
explore important topics and others purely
entertain. However, few of these films fulfill
a simple and basic requirement: passing the
Bechdel Test. This test, named after Ameri-
can cartoonist Alison Bechdel, is a simple
and easy tool that many use to determine if
a movie has gender bias. In order for a movie
or television show to pass this test, it must
have at least two women in it who talk to each
other about something besides a man. While
this is an incredibly low standard for a movie
to uphold, many movies that appear on award
show nomination lists this year fail to pass.
Of the nine films nominated for the Acad-
emy Award for Best Picture, five failed this
painfully easy test. The two additional films
that were nominated for the Golden Globe
for Best Picture also failed. These problems
are indicative of a larger-scale problem in the
movie industry. Of the 50 top-grossing films
of 2013, 21 failed the Bechdel test. Though the
movies that passed the test typically made
more money than those that didn't pass, the
number of movies in 2013 that marginalized
women closely resembles patterns seen in
years past. Why this misogyny in the movie
industry exists is difficult to say.
Perhaps this issue is the result of a lack of
female representation in the movie industry.
The percentage of females working behind
the scenes is staggeringly low and probably
contributes to the lack of female representa-
tion on screen. The Geena Davis Institute on
Gender in Media has found that of the 1,565
content creators, only 7 percent of direc-

tors, 13 percent of writers and 20 percent of
producers are females. This means that the
ratio of males to females working behind the
camera is 4.8:1. No wonder males outnum-
ber females so heavily on the big screen. It's
even less surprising then, that women are so
inclined to only discuss men during movies.
It's hardly shocking that this male-dominat-
ed field can scarcely imagine women having
any other topic of conversation.
Though there are many more statistics
and observations to support the fact that
the movie industry both underrepresents
and misrepresents females, one might ask
why this is so important. Yes, it's obviously
a problem, but why should we care so much
about this shallow and superficial industry?
Well, first of all, it is indicative of much larger
issues in the United States - the underrep-
resentation of women in many fields of work,
the glass ceiling and the wage gap. Secondly,
the movie industry influences people on a
huge scale and can without a doubt affect the
way we think from a very young age.
Imagine the effect that this gender imbal-
ance and male focus can have on us. Growing
up watching movies that lack multi-dimen-
sional female characters is incredibly prob-
lematic and no doubt sets us up for failure
to overcome other issues facing women. It's
undeniable that media portrayal affects the
way both males and females think and act.
This is especially true when most of the
women with speaking roles are sexualized or
simplified to a stereotype. Although there has
been some progress when it comes to strong,
complex female characters in the industry,
there is still a long way to go as far as females
in front of and behind the camera; this award
season has been a glaring example of this.
Marykate Winn is an LSA freshman.

On April 10, 2010, the very first
TEDxUofM conference was held
in the Biomedical Science Research
Building, inviting a crowd of 300
people to explore "ideas worth
spreading." Four years and four
conferences later, we're inviting
1,300 attendees to share the experi-
ence once more at the Power Center.
In light of the media's recent criti-
cism of TED and the realization of
our fifth anniversary we would be
remiss to ask ... why?
Why is TEDxUofM important?
Many would immediately look
to the speakers: skilled orators,
performers, thinkers, musicians,
academics and so much more. Our
speakers are members of the Uni-
versity of Michigan community
who have the opportunity to inspire
in 18 minutes or less. While some
appear as though they were born to
be on the TED stage - exuding an
air of comfort in their presentation
- the reality is that their presence
on the stage is often unfamiliar,
new and exciting. Presenting their
life's work through the lens of an
overarching common theme, this
is their moment to show why their
idea is different. Why their idea is
unsettling. Why their idea matters.
But let's slow down. Concentrat-
ing years of research, degrees and
experiences into one talk seems
nearly impossible considering the
wealth of knowledge necessary
to even scratch the surface on an
advanced idea. Professional confer-
ences, comparatively, are presented
over the course of days and require
expertise as aprerequisite for atten-
dance. How can we possibly expect
to intelligibly present enough infor-
mation for comprehension without
divulging the didactic particulars?
The answer lies - somewhat

unsuspectingly - in our attendees.
Students, members of the University
community, Ann Arborites and fam-
ily members; our attendees are unre-
lenting investigators who are able
to digest a talk down to its founda-
tion. They're hungry, not focusing in
on an isolated problem, but instead
placing ideas within a larger context.
They're hungry to connect with a
new field of study; hungry to chal-
lenge and be challenged; hungry to
move out of their comfort zone and
be a part of something bigger. It's
this energy that permeates through
the Power Center. It radiates from
the stage when one talk comes to
an end, and persists through engag-
ing conversation that often spills out
from the mirrored glass doors. Then
the lights dim, a speaker steps out
and another cycle begins.
Even our passionate audience,
however, can't ignore the fact that
TEDxUofM is over in eight hours.
Its existence feels like a strike of
lightning, a haiku or perhaps a neu-
ronal action potential. After all the
effort put in by the speakers, the
time taken by the attendees and
the organizational work done by
the team, how does the conference
have a lasting influence?
The persistence - of TEDxUofM
talks can partially be explained
through their design. The backbone
of every talk isn't about some inno-
vation - a commonly misconceived
notion - these talks are about ideas:
entropy-increasing, foundation-
shaking ideas with the uncanny
ability to ripple through into diverse
areas of thought. Suddenly, a pre-
med student is thinking about the
adversity overcome by Jackie Robin-
son and global health inequality. An
artist sees a prison as a collection of
untapped creativity rather than an

institution of criminals. A professor
is inspired by the inextinguishable,
unimaginable, unexplainable will of
two young men to overcome paraly-
sis. These ideas stay with you. We
dare to even suggest that they change
you. Forever.
In recognition of our confer-
ence's finite lifespan, we have
diversified to accommodate conver-
sations all year long. Gallery open-
ings, daily blog posts and monthly
salons facilitating "conversations
worth having," fill the calendars of
our community. Recently, we have
undertaken a new venture along
with the College of Engineering
entitled Campus of the Future, a
series of salons focusing on what
education at the University will
look like in 50 years. We're expand-
ing our reach, rejecting complacen-
cy and evolving with the needs of
our community.
Despite all this, when asked why
TEDxUofM is important, mem-
bers of our team don't immediately
think of our speakers, our attend-
ees or the work they do with the
community. They think of the new
student walking onto the Diag and
feeling overwhelmed by the possi-
bilities a community of 40,000 has
to offer. TEDxUofM is for them. It's
there to help them find a new pas-
sion or perhaps rethink an old one.
It exists as a catalyst connecting
thinkers, both young and old, look-
ing to make an impact on the world.
We are here for you.
We ask that you join us on Sat-
urday, March 15th and help us con-
tinue transforming through ideas
worth spreading. The application to
attend is open now.

Remembering one
of the greatest
actors of all time
By AKSHAY SETH
ManagingArts Editor
In "Boogie Nights," Scotty J.
hesitates. It never really mat-
ters what he's doing, because
in the brief moments before he
does it, he pauses. Then shakes
his head. Then ruminates.
Then, after wading through
a quicksand of insecurity, he
pauses again. When he finally
opens his mouth, the jumble of
stuttered speech tumbling out
stinks of the timid self-doubt
Philip Seymour Hoffman, who
passed away Sunday, is trying to
pin on us.
We see the wheels turn-
ing in every scene. Over and
over again, Scotty fumbles in
his arguments. Over and over,
Hoffman paints an ugly portrait
of uncertainty inches from our
eyes, enunciating the slightest
brushstrokes, making sure we
all have some sort of answer to
that intriguing question of what
makes Scotty J. tick.
The technique builds in
weight until Scotty's memora-
ble confrontation with his love
interest, and our protagonist,
Dirk Diggler.
And suddenly, it all topples.
The bricks clutter down and
reveal why one of the biggest
reasons this scene sticks out is
we don't see the wheels turning.
There's cruelty in having the
Band-Aid ripped off so quickly,
in watching Scotty gamble on
his emotions for the first time
- only for it all to go so wrong,
so abruptly. For once, we see the
aftermath, and in that littered
aftermath, we glimpse Hoff-
man's genius.
Small traces of that remark-
able performance are visible in
every brilliant, indelible role he
took after. Despite the variety
of characters he portrayed in
his twenty-plus years on screen
and on stage, Hoffman gravi-
tated toward a common thread
of vulnerability. Project after
project, he became the mae-
stro, far-removed from center
stage, puppeteering the band of
unhinged misfits living in the
darker recesses of our imagina-
tion.
From pedophilic Jacob Eln-
sky in "25th Hour" to wealth-
obsessed Andy Hanson in
"Before the Devil Knows You're
Dead," Hoffman lived for that
one make-or-break scene in
which he'd lay it all on the table,
daring his audience to show
sympathy. And when we inevi-
tably did, like all great actors,
he'd have us reeling, sifting
through our own notions of
morality.
He .thrived in the grayness
between right and wrong.
Unlike so many others of our
generation, Hoffman had the
unique ability to expose weak-
ness without coming off as a
panderer. He did it through
honesty. If you look - really
look - at Hoffman's face when

he's acting, you'll be struck by
how little he gives away. In
"Capote," regrettably his only
Academy Award-winning per-
formance, listen for the pal-
pable gulps he pauses to take
after delivering his lines in that
high, rattling rasp - little cues
gently sheathing the decisions
he's making on camera. More
so than any other actor I've
ever seen, Hoffman, through
those seemingly insignificant
tics, forces his audience to
hold out for the intense release
in emotion that accompanies
a deep, raging tantrum or an
extended, impactful inhalation
of air. Even his irrelevant eye-
rolls and half-mocking smiles
in "The Talented Mr. Ripley"
do more to convey a suspicious
sense of unavoidable doom than
anything else in the script.
I don't remember the first
Hoffman movie I saw, not
because of his inconspicuous
appearance or because he was
playing some throwaway bit-
part, but because the depth of
each and every one of his por-
trayals defines my most basic
understanding of performance.
It has to. He started acting two
years before I was born. I grew
up watching him. I saw him
steal scenes in many of the most
meaningful movies of my life -
movies that piqued my interest
in film and will forever char-
acterize my appreciation of it.
He wasn't just one of the most
accomplished actors Hollywood
has ever seen. He was among
the first great actors my genera-
tion had ever seen.
And without so much of
the love or appreciation he
deserved, he died alone, in a
Greenwich Village apartment
after a heroin overdose. He was
46 years old. The expected out-
pouring of support from fans

egacy
and peers alike is there, but
the fact of the matter remains:
We've lost a legend, our legend.
In a 2008 interview with
The New York Times, Hoffman
recounted a story from his first
few years as an actor.
"In my mid-20s, an actor told
me, 'Acting ain't no puzzle,' "
Hoffman said. "I thought: 'Ain't
no puzzle?!?' You must be bad!"
He laughed. "You must be really
bad, because it is a puzzle. Cre-
ating anything is hard. It's a cli-
ch6 thing to say, but every time
you start a job, you just don't
know anything. I mean, I can
break something down, but ulti-
mately I don't know anything
when I start work on a new
movie. You start stabbing out,
and you make a mistake, and
it's not right, and then you try
again and again. The key is you
have to commit. And that's hard
because you have to find what it
is you are committing to."
One beautiful thing I've
noticed about cinema is how
often that commitment compels
bravery - bravery in being so
inexplicably tied to a craft that
you're willing to stake your life
on it. Bravery in facing the tor-
ture of striving for greatness.
And ultimately, bravery in let-
ting go.
Like any number of the
greats, Hoffman will live on
in his work, as he should. Like
many others, I'll remember him
in the lilting charisma of Tru-
man Capote, that melancholy,
high-pitched self-assuredness.
And years down the line, I hope
he'll still be there, peeking at
me through those horn-rimmed
spectacles, martini and ciga-
rette in hand. And in that brief,
magical moment, I'll be grate-
ful - grateful for the laughs
we shared through an invisible
screen.

The festival had every type of
folk a good folk festival should
have. It had bluesy folk and
romantic folk, country folk and
funny folk, big-smiled energetic
folk and mellow folk. Men and

3,500-some folks of all kinds in
the audience.
Friday and Saturday were
nights full of gorgeous harmo-

from musicians like "what a nice

Sochi preparations ongoing

U.S. warships and
FBI agents deploy
in response to
terrorist threats
WASHINGTON (AP) - U.S.
officials saythe first of two Amer-
ican warships heading into the
Black Sea in advance of the Olym-
pic Games has sailed from Italy.
In another sign of U.S. efforts to
protect Americans at the Winter
Games, the FBI says at least two
dozen agents are going to Sochi,
Russia.
Some Olympic
athletes may speak
out against anti-gay
Russian laws
NEW YORK (AP) - Despite
seven months of international
outcry, Russia's law restrict-
ing gay-rights activity remains
in place. Yet the eclectic protest
campaign has heartened activists
in Russia and caught the atten-
tion of its targets - including
organizers and sponsors of the
Sochi Olympics that open on Feb.
7.
Over the past two weeks, two
major sponsors, Coca-Cola and
McDonald's, have seen some of
their Sochi-related social media
campaigns commandeered by
gay-rights supporters who want
the companies to condemn the
law. Several activists plan to
travel to Sochi, hoping to team up
with sympathetic athletes to pro-
test the law while in the Olympic
spotlight.

The USS Mount Whitney got
underway Friday from Gaeta,
Italy, and the Navy frigate USS

Naples, Italy, on Saturday. The
officials spoke about the war-
ships on condition of anonymity
because they are not authorized
to publicly disclose ship move-
ments.
FBI Director James Comey
told reporters in Albuquerque,
N.M., on Friday that the FBI is
in constant contact with Rus-
sian authorities as the Games
approach. Comey says he spoke
And on Friday, a coalition of
40 human-rights and gay-rights
groups from the U.S., Western
Europe and Russia - including
Amnesty International, Human
Rights Watch and the Human
Rights Campaign - released
an open letter to the 10biggest
Olympic sponsors, urging them
to denounce the law and run ads
promoting equality for lesbians,
gays, bisexuals and transgender
people.
"LGBT people must not be tar-
geted with violence or deprived of
their ability to advocate for their
own equality," the letter said. "As
all eyes turn toward Sochi, we ask
you to stand with us."
The law, signed by Russian
President Vladimir Putin in July,
bans pro-gay "propaganda" that
could be accessible to minors -
a measure viewed by activists
as forbidding almost any public
expression of gay-rights senti-
ment. The law cleared parlia-

Alexei Sorokin, director gen-
eral of pest control firm Basya
Services, told The Associated
Press thathis company had a con-
tract to exterminate the animals
throughout the Olympics, which
open Friday.
Sorokin described his company
as being involved in the "catching
and disposing" of dogs, although
he refused to specify how the
dogs would be killed or say where
they woul4,take thfe carcasses.
The dogs have been causing
numerous problems, Sorokin said
Monday, including "biting chil-
dren."
He said he was stunned last

earlier in the day to the head of
the Russian Federal Security Ser-
vice.
Comey says Russian authori-
ties face a serious threat and he
wants the FBI to be ready to help.
Russian and U.S. defense offi-
cials, including Pentagon chief
Chuck Hagel, have discussed the
Olympic security threat. The U.S.
has offered to help in any way
needed, but no specific assistance
has been requested.
The Pentagon has said the U.S.
warships are deploying to the
Black Sea as part of normal mili-
tary planning and could perform
any required missions, including
communications or evacuations.
ists have pressed the Interna-
tional Olympic Committee and
Olympic sponsors to call for the
law's repeal. Instead, the IOC
and top sponsors have expressed
general opposition to discrimina-
tion and pledged to ensure that
athletes, spectators and others
gathering for the Games would
not be affected by the law. Putin
has given similar assurances
in regard to Sochi, but remains
committed to the law's broader
purposes.
IOC President Thomas Bach
has warned Olympic athletes that
they are barred from political
gestures while on medal podiums
or in other official venues, but
says they are free to make politi-
cal statements at news confer-
ences.
One Olympian likely to speak
out is gay Australian snowboard-
er Belle Brockhoff, who told Aus-
tralia's Courier-Mail newspaper
that she plans to lambaste Putin.
"After I compete, I'm willing to
rip on his ass," she told the news-
paper. "I'm not happy and there's
a bunch of other Olympians who
are not happy either."

saw a stray dog walking in on the
performers.
"A dog ran into the Fisht Sta-

"God forbid something like this
happens at the actual opening
ceremony. Tbis will be a disgrace
for the whole country."
The strays tend to gather near
construction sites where they
have gotten food and shelter from
workers. Dogs have even been
able to get inside the Olympic
Park and accredited hotel com-
plexes and villages, in the coastal
cluster of arenas and venues up in
the mountains.

Joan Mondale was
an avid potter,
gave her pieces to
dignitaries as gifts
ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) - Joan
Mondale, who burnished a repu-
tation as "Joan of Art" for her
passionate advocacy for the arts
while her husband was vice presi-
dent and a U.S. ambassador, died
Monday. She was 83.
Walter Mondale, sons Ted and
William and other family mem-
bers were by her side when she
died, the family said in a state-
ment released by their church.
The family had announced Sun-
day that she had gone into hos-
pice care, but declined to discuss
her illness.
"Joan was greatly loved by
many. We will miss her dearly,"
the former vice president said in
a written statement.
An arts lover and an avid pot-
ter, Joan Mondale was given a
grand platform to promote the
arts when Walter, then a Demo-
cratic senator, was elected Jimmy
Carter's vice president in 1976.
Carter named her honorary
chairwoman of the Federal Coun-
cil on the Arts and Humanities,
and in that role she frequently
traveled to museums, theaters
and artist studios on the adminis-

gress and states to boost public
arts programs and funding.
She also showcased the work of
prominent artistsin the vice pres-
idential residence, including pho-
tographer Ansel Adams, sculptor
David Smith and painter Georgia
O'Keeffe.
Her enthusiasm for the cause
earned widespread praise in
the arts community, including
from Jim Melchert, director of
the visual arts program for the
National Endowment for the Arts
during Carter's administration.
"Your rare fire has brightened
many a day for more people than
you may imagine," Melchert
wrote to her after the 1980 Cart-
er-Mondale re-election defeat.
"What you've done with style
and seeming ease will continue

As Carter's No. 2, Walter Mon-
dale was seen asa trusted adviser
and credited with making the
office of the vice president more
relevant. It was natural that his
wife would do the same for her
role. Vice presidential aide Al
Eisele once said of his boss: "It
was important to him that Joan
not just be the vice president's
wife, but his.partner."

"She was always down to
earth," Klobuchar said Monday.
"She was just as happy going out
to rural farms in Elmore (Min.)
as she was mixing it up at fancy
receptions at the ambassador's
residence in Japan."
During her husband's ambas-

in Art," Joan Mondale framed a
connection between the two.
"Sometimes we do not realize
how important our participation
in politics is. Often we need to be
reminded of our duty as citizens,"
she wrote. "Artists can do just
that; they can look at our politi-
cians, our institutions and our
problems to help us understand
them better."
She was born Joan Adams in

Research finds
drinking two cans
of soda a day can
increase risk
CHICAGO (AP) - Could too
much sugar be deadly? The big-
gest study of its kind suggests.
the answer is yes, at least when
it comes to fatal heart problems.
It doesn't take all that much
extra sugar, hidden in many
processed foods, to substantial-
ly raise the risk, the researchers
found, and most Americans eat
more than the safest amount.
Having a cinnamon roll with
your morning coffee, a super-
sized sugary soda at lunch and
a scoop of ice cream after din-
ner would put you in the highest
risk category in the study. That
means your chance of dying pre-
maturely from heart problems is
nearly three times greater than
for people who eat only foods
with little added sugar.
For someone who normally
eats 2,000 calories daily, even
consuming two 12-ounce cans of
soda substantially increases the
risk. For most American adults,
sodas and other sugary drinks
are the main source of added
sugar.
Lead author Quanhe Yang of
the U.S. Centers of Disease Con-
trol and Prevention called the
results sobering and said it's the
first nationally representative
study to examine the issue.
Scientists aren't certain
exactly how sugar may con-
tribute to deadly heart prob-
lems, but it has been shown to
increase blood pressure and
levels of unhealthy cholesterol
and triglycerides; and also may
increase signs of inflammation
linked with heart disease, said
Rachel Johnson, head of the
American Heart Association's
nutrition committee and a Uni-
versity of Vermont nutrition

professor.
Yang and colleagues analyzed
national health surveys between
1988 and 2010 that included
questions about people's diets.
The authors used national death
data to calculate risks of dying
during 15 years of follow-up.
Overall, more than 30,000
American adults aged 44 on
average were involved.
Previous studies have
linked diets high in sugar with
increased risks for non-fatal
heart problems, and with obe-
sity, which can also lead to heart
trouble. But in the new study,
obesity didn't explain the link
between sugary diets and death.
That link was found even in nor-
mal-weight people who ate lots
of added sugar.
"Too much sugar does not
just make us fat; it can also make
us sick," said Laura Schmidt, a
health policy specialist at the
University of California, San
Francisco. She wrote an edito-
rial accompanying the study in
Monday's JAMA Internal Medi-
cine.
The researchers focused on
sugar added to processed foods
or drinks, or sprinkled in coffee
or cereal. Even foods that don't
taste sweet have added sugar,
including many brands of pack-
aged bread, tomato sauce and
salad dressing. Naturally occur-
ring sugar, in fruit and some
other foods, wasn't counted.
Most health experts agree
that too much sugar isn't
healthy, but there is no univer-
sal consensus on how much is
too much.
U.S government dietary
guidelines issued in 2010 say
"empty" calories including
those from added sugars should
account for no more than 15 per-
cent of total daily calories.
The average number of daily
calories from added sugar
among U.S. adults was about 15
percent toward the end of the
study, slightly lower than in pre-
vious years.

In weekend wins, goal-
scoring slumps broken

TERESA MATHEW/Daily
Redshirt junior Jon Horford saw just eight minutes and went scoreless as the Wolverines dropped their first Big Ten game.
Frontcourt lacks presence

By DANIEL WASSERMAN
Daily Sports Editor
On Saturday, when Indiana
handed the Michigan men's bas-
ketball team its first Big Ten loss,
much of the attention fell on the
Hoosiers'victory in the backcourt.
But lost in the fanfare
surrounding Yogi Ferrell's big day
- the Indiana guard had a game-
leading 27 points while holding
sophomore guard Nik Stauskas
to just six points - was an
ineffective outing from what has
been a surprisingly productive
Wolverine frontcourt.
By now, the storyline sur-
rounding Michigan's unexpected
surge following sophomore for-
ward Mitch McGary's back sur-
gery and ensuing absence has
been beaten to death. And while
Stauskas, averaging 17.2 points in
conference play, has drawn much
of the credit for the Wolverines'
10-game win streak that was
snapped by the Hoosiers, Michi-
gan's under-the-radar frontcourt
tandem has filled in well.
After just two regular-season
starts last season, McGary
exploded onto the scene in the
NCAA Tournament, averaging
14.3 points per game and 10.6
rebounds per game. Those
numbers alone were enough
to land him on nearly every
preseason All-American list.
But over that same six-game
span, forwards Jordan Morgan

and Jon Horford combined to
contribute less than three points
and rebounds per game.
Despite the experience of the
fifth-year senior Morgan, who
started all but two games last
year, and redshirt junior Horford,
filling in McGary's void was
thought to be a difficult task, if not
impossible.
But heading into Sunday's
game in Bloomington, the pair's
contributions had been surpris-
ingly sound. A quick glimpse
at either of the players' indi-
vidual statistics reveals nothing
astounding - Morgan was aver-
aging 8.4 points per game and 5.3
rebounds per game, while Hor-
ford posted 6.3 points per game
and 5.1 rebounds per game - but
combined, their 14.7 points per
game and 10.4 rebounds per game
mirror McGary's tournament
numbers almost exactly.
So what went wrong against
Indiana?
Well, Michigan (8-1 Big Ten,
16-5 overall) will be hard-pressed
towinanygameswhenitconnects
on just three 3-pointers or posts a
23.3-percent mark from beyond
the arc, and is in poor shape when
Stauskas is held to a double-digit
scoring output, as evidenced in
losses to Duke in December and
the Hoosiers on Sunday.
But Stauskas wasn't alone in
his ineffective outing. Horford
was held scoreless and didn't
collect a single rebound in just

eight minutes. Morgan scored five
points, but was just 1-for-5 from
the charity stripe, including a
couple key front-end misses with
the Wolverines trailing down the
stretch. Though his 10 rebounds
were a respectable figure,
someone had to grab rebounds for
Michigan, which was otherwise
outrebounded 31-22 - eight
below its season average and just
two short of a season low.
Combined, the frontcourt duo's
five-point, 10-rebound outing,
was the lowest-scoring out-
put in nine conference games
to date. On an afternoon with
Stauskas stifled from the open-
ing tip, the lack of scoring in the
post resulted in a 63-52 loss,
the Wolverines' lowest-scoring
total of the season.
"I don't have all the answers,"
saidMichigan coach JohnBeilein.
"Obviously if I had answers, we
wouldn't have scored 52 points."
Through the struggles,
though, Beilein saw positives.
Noting that he never expected to
remain undefeated throughout
conference play, Beilein was quick
to note that more growth comes
out of losses than wins.
"We'll address the issues we
think we need to improve on," he
said on Monday's Big Ten telecon-
ference. "We expect them to get
back on the horse and keep learn-
ing. I think our staff does a great
job at just framing up these games
so we can grow from them."

Daily Sports Writer
For the No. 10 Michigan
hockey team, returning to
Yost Ice Arena to defeat No. 12
Wisconsin was less about shat-
tering sticks and more about
snapping streaks.
With a win Friday, the
Wolverines ended a four-game
losing streak to the Badgers
that dated back to November
2009. Just as important,
though, were the individual
slumps that ended.
The first by freshman for-
ward Tyler Motte, who accu-
mulated 10 points in the first
half of the season, and regis-
tered his first point since Jan.
10 in Madison. It was his first
goal since Nov. 22, ending an
11-week, nine-game dryspell.
And Saturday, Motte began a
new streak, finding twine for
the second-straight day.
But when one freshman
forward heated up, another
cooled down. After a four-point
outburst against Michigan
State, JT Compher ended his
hot streak Friday.
Still, Motte's two tallies,
combined with an assist from
freshman defenseman Michael
Downing, extended yet another
important streak - a Michigan
freshman has registered a
point in 20 of the Wolverines'
22 games this season.
"It was good for (Motte) to
get out of his slump, because
he is a player who the puck fol-
lows," said Michigan coach Red
Berenson. "He's a smart player,
so it's been strange for him to
have a drought like that."
Minutes after Motte's tally,
junior forward Alex Guptill
added his seventh goal of the
season. His last goal had come
at Yost, when Michigan fin-
ished up a homestand against
Ferris State on Dec.11- 51 days
before Friday's contest.
After Friday's game, Guptill
spoke about getting his
swagger back.
"I think I've been a little

snake-bitten lately, but I feel
like I've been getting my chanc-
es and I got one tonight, which
was nice," he said on Friday. "I
think all the credit goes to my
linemates. They are making me
look good out there."
Berenson had been waiting
for Guptill to have a breakout
game and was pleased with his
performance. Now, though, it's
about continuing that streak of
strong performances.
Junior forward Zach Hyman
also got himself back on the
board. Hyman - who created
several scoring chances on his
new line with senior forward
Luke Moffatt and junior Phil
Di Giuseppe against Michigan
State - found twine for the
first time since Dec. 1 against
Ohio State before adding an
assist Saturday.
With more experience under
its belt than any other trio,
Michigan's

would have ended his months-
long scoreless streak. Though
his play has improved since
being moved to the wing posi-
tion, Nieves hasn't tallied a goal
since Oct. 12 against Rochester
Institute of Technology.
The offense is gaining
confidence, he said, which
will be key as the Wolverines
turn scoreless slumps into
scoring streaks.
Of course, not everyone
scored against a strong shot-
blocking Badger defense. The
power play went 0-for-8 and
some of Michigan's top scorers
were left off the stat sheet.
During the waning minutes
of overtime play Saturday,
sophomore forward Andrew
Copp broke away from a
defender. For a moment, it
looked as if he would secure
his third extra-frame goal
this season. He wound up and
fired, but his

third line was
the differ-
ence against
Wisconsin,
accounting
for four even-

goals.
"Motte's
goal was a

line, too,"
Berenson said. "I

For Wolverines, a fall back to reality

I's hard to decide which
fact is more surprising:
that the Michigan women's
basketball team is 14-8, or that
only one month ago, predicting a
14-8 record Feb. 3 would've been
pessimistic.
Michigan coach Kim Barnes
Arico doesn't claim to have
seen the
Wolverines'
success
coming -
anything but,
as a matter
of fact. In
the weeks
leading up to LEV
their season- F
opening FACHER
exhibition
against
Wayne State, the second-year
coach was dropping the phrase
"transition year" and citing
the her team's relative lack of
experience as a reason it might
have trouble staying competitive
in Big Ten play. Missing out on
the NCAA Tournament felt like
a foregone conclusion.
Making the NCAA Tourna-
ment doesn't seem likely now,
either. But it did, at one point,
and it's the emotional parabola
that transpired between the
beginning of the season and now
that's remarkable.
Barnes Arico's jump to a
"transition year" mentality was
hardly unwarranted. The start-
ing lineup she put on the floor
for that early November tune-up
featured junior forward Nicole
Elmblad alongside two players
who'd never made an appear-
ance in a Michigan uniform
and two more who averaged
a respective 1.1 and 2.7 points
per game last season. Elmblad,
too, averaged just 4.3 points last
year, on a team that relied heav-
ily on five seniors who took 90

percent of Michigan's scoring
with them as they accepted their
diplomas in May.
An 11-point loss to Bowling
Green in the Wolverines'
regular-season opener seemed
to confirm the prevailingtheory
that Michigan might have to
wait until next year to make any
postseason noise.
It took a buzzer-beating
turnaround jumper from junior
forward Cyesha Goree to force
overtime against Arizona, and to
keep a glimmer of hope alive. It
took four days for that newfound
sense of optimism to be dashed
by a disappointing overtime loss
to Xavier in Michigan's home
opener. It took another month
after that for the Wolverines to
go on 6-1 tear that included an
impressive win over Texas Tech.
The lone loss was a 64-62
nail-biter against No. 15 LSU
that saw the Wolverines, playing
without junior guard Shannon
Smith - the team's leading
scorer at the time - stand
their ground against one of the
nation's best teams.
This much was clear - "tran-
sition year" no longer applied.
When asked after Michigan's
Jan. 18 win over Illinois if she
had seen any of her team's
success coming, Barnes Arico
could only laugh.
"Oh my goodness, no," she
said. "No, but ... it's the kids.
They're just unbelievable. They
have great chemistry. They're so
unselfish. They buy into working
hard."
It wasn't just a coach
mindlessly glowing about her
hard-working team to the
media, either. The prospect of
being unsuccessful seems not to
have occurred to Barnes Arico's
players.
Sure enough, Goree didn't
blink before calmly responding,

TRACY KO/Daily
Michigan women's basketball coach Kim Barnes Arico has managed to take her team from an expected transition year to a bubble team in the NCAA Tournament.

"yes" to the same question. If
they worked hard enough, she
said, there was no doubt in
their minds that they'd be as
successful as they'd been.
The same spirit of innocence,
coupled with the attitude that
hard work has no equal, is
prevalent throughout the roster.
Before this winter, freshman
guard Siera Thompson had
never seen snow, and hasn't seen
her family for more than a week
since arriving at Michigan in
June. Despite the drastic chang-
es, she's leading the Wolverines
in scoring and has established
herself as one of the nation's
best 3-point shooters. Over the
offseason, Goree dropped 20
pounds, and the results showed

- she's playing 10 times as many
minutes as she did last year,
and has turned into a beast on
the boards. Smith, for her part,
waits in the wings until her
teammates have trouble scoring,
then unveils an absurd display
of ballhandling and near-impos-
sible shots that sometimes leave
defenses gaping.
For a few weeks, it seemed
like Barnes Arico's transition
year was actually a transition
month, and that November was
far in the past.
But at some point, things
had to come back to reality. No
matter how good Thompson
and sophomore guard Madison
Ristovski were from beyond
the arc, and no matter how

scrappy Elmblad and Goree
were on the inside, and no
matter how dominant Smith
can be when she decides to take
over, Michigan still has to work
within the constraints of a team
relying on three or four regular
starters. All depending on the
night, for players who've never
seen serious college minutes.
The Wolverines' four losses
in their past seven games have
given them the perspective
they've been missing. An at-
large bid to the NCAA tourna-
ment seems unlikely after a
pair of painful home losses to
Ohio State and Minnesota and
an 84-51 drubbing at Nebraska.
Michigan isn't quite there - yet.
But without ruling out any

surprise runs at the Big Ten
Tournament in early March, this
much can be said: The Wolver-
ines' run at next year's Big Ten
Tournament probably won't be
a surprise at all. It wouldn't be
surprising, either, to see Michi-
gan appear in next year's top-25
polls within the season's first
few weeks, or for Thompson to
work her way onto a preseason
Wade Trophy Watch List, or for
crowds next year at Crisler Cen-
ter to resemble, well, crowds.
Whether or not Barnes Ari-
co's team surprises everyone yet
again with a late-season push for
the Big Dance is inconsequen-
tial. If this year is a transition,
no coach in the Big Ten wants to
see the continuation.

FOOTBALL RECRUITING
Football set to ink
nine signatures

Hoke speaks on disciplinary policy

By JASON RUBINSTEIN
DailySports Writer
In the college football
world, the first Wednesday of
every February is normally
characterized by chaos and
waitingonlast-minutedecisions.
It's National Signing Day, the
first day seniors in high school
can sign a binding letter of intent
to a college of the player's choice,
if offered to play football.
But for the Michigan football.
team, the 2014 edition of Nation-
al Signing Day should be relative-
ly quiet - a rarity in the program.
For only the third time since
2002, the Wolverines aren't
expecting anyone to sign who
isn't already committed. Only
one player, five-star defensive
end Malik McDowell, isbelieved
to be considering Michigan, but
the odds of landing him are slim.
"I would be shocked if he
chose Michigan," 247Sports's
Steve Lorenz said. "As of last
week, (running back coach Fred)
Jackson, his primary recruiter,
thought (McDowell) would
choose Michigan. But now, his
parents know he doesn't want to
go to Michigan, but his parents
don't want Michigan State, so
it's going to be a compromise.
If I had to choose, I would say
Florida State, but wouldn't rule
out Ohio State."
Despite the absence of any
drama, Michigan is expecting
the nine remaining verbal
commitments of the 2014 class
to signtheir letter of intent.
Though nine may seem small,
the Wolverines had seven early
enrollees, a program record.
Quarterback Wilton Speight,
wide receivers Freddy Canteen
and Drake Harris, defensive
tackle Bryan Mone, cornerback
Brandon Watson, offensive line-
man Mason Cole and linebacker
Michael Ferns have already

started classes at the University.
So why is Michigan seeing so
many early enrollees? Look no
further than the results of last
year's early enrllees.
"You look at a guy like (fresh-
man tight end) Jake Butt: he's a
perfect example of somebody
who benefited tremendously
from enrolling early," Lorenz
said. "Those extra six months are
huge. It's just amatter of getting
into the playbook early, getting
into the weight room and assimi-
lating into Michigan in general."
Early enrollees aside, Michi-
gan's remaining nine commits
are some high-profile players.
Jabrill Peppers, a five-star
cornerback from Paramus,
N.J., is the Wolverines' highest-
ranked recruit ever. Peppers,
who many see as a two-way
player, like Charles Woodson
during his time at Michigan, is
ranked No. 2 overall by ESPN.
The Wolverines are also
expecting signings from six
other defensive players. By
Wednesday night, defensive
linemen Lawrerce Marshall and
Brady Pallante and linebacker's
Noah Furbush, Jared Wangler
and Chase Winovich should be
declared Wolverines.
Offensively, Michigan is
expecting the signatures from
tight end Ian Bunting, offensive
tackle Juwann Bushell-Beatty
and wide receiver Maurice Ways.
But signing day should be rel-
atively uneventful for Michigan
coach Brady Hoke - just the way
he likes it, says Lorenz.
"You'll see it happen again
with the 2015 class," Lorenz
said. "They like to find a concise,
small group of targets early
and go after them hard and get
them on campus for visit days. I
know they are still in it for Malik
McDowell, but trust me, if they
could avoid situations like this,
they weuld."

ByGREG GARNO
Daily Sports Editor
Michigan football coach Brady
Hoke spoke to reporters on Mon-
day for the first time since The
Michigan Daily reported last
week that former kicker Bren-
dan Gibbons was permanently
separated from the University for
violating the Student Sexual Mis-
conduct Policyon Nov.22, 2009.
"Michigan Athletics has no
influence over any part of a
review of a potential violation
of University's student code of
conduct - not the process, the
investigation or the timing of the
resolution," Hoke said in a state-
ment before talking with report-
ers. "In general, while we may be
aware of an on-going proceeding,
we alwaysstrive to balance trans-
parency with privacy.
"Our usual approach is to not
issue discipline related to a stu-
dent'sstandingontheteambefore
the University's process runs
its course and the outcome has
been determined. We will always
respect the rights and confidenti-
ality of the process and the parties
involved. One way we do that is by
not discussing the details of stu-
dent disciplinary matters.
"So while I would like to be
more forthcoming, I can't provide
any details due to federal privacy
laws and University policies."
Hoke continued, elaborating
on Michigan football's standards
of conduct.
"We talk every day with our
kids about the importance of
character and integrity. It's
something we take very seriously,
how we're going to do things the
rightway.Wetalkdailyaboutyour
name and what it means. That's
why you get into this as a coach,
to help young men grow and learn
and mature. We're held to those
standards, and we hold them to
that. I think we've made clear
our expectations, and our actions
and discipline involving incidents
in the past have reflected that.
And those standards will not be

compromised."
According to media reports,
Hoke did not mention Gibbons by
name and did not disclose wheth-
er he was aware that Gibbons was
permanently separated, citing
federal privacy laws.
"Believe me, it'd be easier to
discuss everything," Hoke told
reporters. "But due to privacy
and everything else, it's not
going to happen.
"Federal laws and allithatstuff,
and University policy. ... And to
be honest with you, it's not fair
to anybody involved with it (to
discuss it publicly)."
The University's Office of
Student Conflict Resolution
found Gibbons responsible for
the reported conduct on or before
Nov. 20, 2013, but Gibbons played
in the Nov. 23 game at Iowa. He
Â° did not play against Ohio State
the following week because

of what Hoke called an injury.
Gibbons did not play in the Dec.
28 Buffalo Wild Wings Bowl
because of what Hoke said were
"family matters."
According to reports, Hoke
discussed working to resolve
character issues in the past.
"You can go back and look at all
the different cases that we've had
- which we haven't had many -
but there's been consequences
and discipline and those things."
Within the past year, Hoke
suspended sophomore tight end
A.J. Williams for one game after
Williams was caught driving
under the influence while being
under the legal drinking age.
Junior defensive end Frank Clark
and fifth-year senior running
back Fitzgerald Toussaint were
also suspended one game after
they were charged with felonious
home invasion and driving under

the influence, respectively.
"Track record, I've dealt with
everything that's happened on
this team, from character issues
to the integrity they have,"
Hoke said, according to media
reports. "Those are two of the
most important things that I
have, is my character and my
integrity, and I got into coaching
to help kids understand that.
That's a huge part of what this
job is and why I got into it. For
people to attack the character
and integrity that we have as a
program, as Michigan and me
personally, I think is something
that's something that's not true.
Because we've dealt with it.
"I get a lot of help when
something goes bad or a bad
decision is made."
Hoke isscheduled toomeet with
reporters again on Wednesday to
discuss National Signing Day.
