Polls: Stabenow
has large lead
over challenger
Hoekstra
By ANDREW SCHULMAN
Daily StaffReporter
A few hours after the polls
closed on primary election night
in 1992, Pete Hoekstra's phone
started ringing, and 'it didn't
stop. On the line was a cadre of
local journalists scrambling to
find out where Hoekstra, then
a little-known candidate for the
U.S. House of Representatives,
was holding his Election Night
party.
The journalists had not both-
ered to ask before because they
had assumed he would lose.
He had only raised $45,000,
$30,000 of which was his own
money. He had no political
experience and was running
against Guy Vander Jagt, a
26-year incumbent who chaired
the National Republican Con-
gressional Committee.

"It was probably the one year
that I could have won - some-
one with no money, getting on
a bicycle, running against a
26-year incumbent," Hoekstra
recalled in an interview last
week. "Itwas perfect timing."
Two decades after his five-
point victory over Vander Jagt,
18 of which he spent in Congress
before a failed gubernatorial run
in 2010; Hoekstra is again chal-
lenging an entrenched incum-
bent, U.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow
(D-Mich.).
Despite polls showing Stabe-
nowholding a large double-digit
lead, the race between the can-
didates has been one of the most
heated in the state.
For Hoekstra, the fierceness
of the contest has offered a new
reality of campaigning. He has
not ridden his bike to meet vot-
ers across the .state, as he did
to defeat Vander Jagt in 1992,
in subsequent House elections,
and in his run for the governor-
ship in 2010.
Instead, he has consistently
criticized Stabenow for her
policies, often targeting what

SDS founder
recalls Port Huron
Statement
By ALICIA ADAMCZYK
Daily StaffReporter
Fifty years later, the statement
- which he later finished in a
* cramped house on Arch Street
- is considered one of the most

influential documents for Amer-
ican left-wing activists. After
speaking at conferences across
the country, Hayden, also a for-
mer state California senator and
editor in chief of The Michigan
Daily, returned to the University
on Thursday night to deliver the
keynote address at the confer-
ence, A New Insurgency: The
Port Huron Statement In Its
Time and Ours, which celebrates
the 50th anniversary of the pub-

lication's debut.
Political novelists, University
professors and members of the
original Students for a Demo-
cratic Society, the organization
that drafted the statement, gath-
ered on campus to give lectures
and participate in panel discus-
sions about America's new left
and the future of participatory
democracy. About 500 Universi-
ty students, Ann Arbor residents
and former members of SDS

packed into an East Hall audito-
rium on Thursday night to listen
to Hayden's speech.
In his address, Hayden dis-
cussed the writing process
behind the 25,000-word docu-
ment, as well as its ramifications
today. He said the statement was
influenced by many different
activists and groups, as well as
individual SDS members.

UNIVERSITY'S BOARD OF REGENTS
Steele, Horning hope to
change balance on board

Republican regent
candidates talk
in-state,
* out-of-state ratio
By TUI RADEMAKER
Daily StaffReporter
The two Republican can-
didates running for the Uni-
versity's Board of Regents are
striving to bring a more conser-
vative perspective to the Demo-
crat-controlled board as they vie
for two open spots on Election
Day.

Among their primary con-
cerns are lowering tuition costs
by reallocating the University's
endowment and encouraging
more studentsto take spring and
summer courses by offering low-
ered rates.
Republican candidate Dan
Horning said he hopes to focus
on lowering the cost for in-state
students to prevent constant
year-to-year tuition hikes. Spe-
cifically, he said he would like to
work on ratios between in-state
and out-of-state students that
garner the greatest financial
efficiency for the University.
"The biggest challenge today,
for me, is striking the balance

between in-state and out-of-
state (students): engaging prop-
er tuition for the out-of-state
and international students and
finding more access for the in-
state students," Horning said. "I
think in-state students are pay-
ing too much, and I don't think
out-of-state students are paying
enough."
Horning was previously
elected to the board in 1994 and
served for eight years, primar-
ily dealing with construction
and facility improvement on
Central Campus and serving as
vice chair of the search commit-
tee that hired University Presi-

For RZA, it may never be
enough. Despite being the de
facto leader of the Wu-Tang

Clan and having been heralded
as one of hip hop's most for-
midable talents, the rapper-
producer, whose given name
is Robert Fitzgerald Diggs,
has widened the wake of his
legacy by authoring books, act-
ing in television and film and
even composing film scores and
soundtracks.
Now, all his ambitions
and talents, cultivated from

childhood to manhood, from
"C.R.E.A.M." to Grammies,
have culminated in his directo-
rial debut: "The Man with the
Iron Fists," a martial arts movie
about a vicious battle for gold in
a fabled Chinese village.

What ails Vladimir Putin?
The Russian leader whose

average Russians, and has rarely

SENATE
From Page 1
he views as her record of reck-
less spending and neglect of the
economy. After emerging from
a crowded field of candidates
in the Republican primary
election, he has referred to his
opponent as ' "Debbie Spend-
It-Now," and himself as "Pete
Spend-It-Not."
He also launched a recent
effort to name Stabenow Mich-
igan's "worst senator ever,"
building a website that points
to her support for the Afford-
able Care Act, "wasteful spend-
ing" and failure to create jobs
as reasons why he thinks she
should be replaced.
As he sipped hot chocolate in
an interview at Sweetwater's
Cafe on E. Washington St. last
week, Hoekstra compared Sta-
benow to Vander Jagt by deem-
ing her lost in politics.
"I thought that the current
representative, or in this case
the current senator, was part
of the problem, not part of the
solution," he said of Stabenow.
"I think D.C.'s a mess, I think
Debbie's part of the problem, I
think my background and my
experience says that I could
help fix things, and I think I
can beat her in an election."

A poll released on Wednes-
day by the Detroit Free Press
and WXYZ-TV showed Staben-
ow leading Hoekstra 54 percent
to 33 percent. All 13 polls in the
last two months have showed
Stabenow leading, and in 10
of them she had a double-digit
lead, according to the Detroit
Free Press.
In an interview this week,
Stabenow said she is not sur-
prised by Hoekstra's aggres-
siveness in the last few weeks
given his position in the polls
and the increase of partisan-
ship in Congress - a phenome-
non she attributed to the influx
of Tea Party congressmen in
2010.
She called Hoekstra an
"extreme" candidate, citing
the fact that he co-founded
the Congressional Tea Party
caucus along with U.S. Rep.
Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.).
Stabenow has campaigned
on her support for President
Obama's healthcare reforms,
her support for higher educa-
tion and her record on agri-
culture while in Congress. She
serves as the chairwoman of
the Senate Committee on Agri-
culture, Nutrition and For-
estry.
She said she heavily opposed
the doubling of interesting
rates on student loans this year,

and noted legislation enacted
protecting the Great Lakes as
her proudest achievement dur-
ing her time in the Senate.
She said the issue of higher
education was personal for
her, recalling that she needed
student loans to attend Michi-
gan State University. She went
on to serve in the Michigan
House of Representatives and
Senate, and the U.S. House
before defeating U.S. Sen.
Spencer Abraham (R-Mich.) in
2000.
For his part, Hoekstra, who
graduated from the Univer-
sity's Business School in 1977
and worked for 15 years as vice
president of.marketing for a
Fortune 500 furniture compa-
ny before challenging Vander
Jagt, said he is not worried
about the polls.
He cited the endorsements of
various Michigan Republicans,
including Republican Gov. Rick
Snyder as evidence of his con-
tention in the race.
"I can read about this horse
race every day," he said. "Every
phone call is about, 'How's the
horse race? How's the horse
race?' The bottom line is, we've
got a plan, we're executing it
- that's the most important
thing. And we think that the
plan gets us over the top at 8
p.m. on Nov. 6."

HAYDEN
From Page 1
that ideas don't come out of one
person's head," he said. "Ideas
are nothing if they're individual
ideas."
He skid the real genius of the
statement was that it unified of
people who already had respect
for each other's ideas.
"(Members of SDS) couldn't
necessarily get over all of their
political disagreements," he said.
"But they knew they had to be
creating the uncreated conscious
of their time."
Humor was prevalent
throughout Hayden's speech,
forcing him to pause multiple
times to let the laughter die down
before continuing.
"I think I'm on emotional
overload, returning to this cam-
pus," Hayden remarked. "I feel
like Barack Obama at the first
debate."
Al Haber, the first president
of SDS, said he's hoping the con-
ference will spurn a new stu-
dent-led movement to address
society's woes, as SDS and other
University students did years
ago. He noted the University's
rich history of activism, includ-
ing serving as the site of the first
teach-ins protests against the
Vietnam War and the birthplace

of the U.S. Peace Corps.
"What I'm particularly press-
ing for is that we see this as
activist and prospective, not as
academic and retrospective,"
Haber said. "Consider yourself
partofthis community, and what
would you put in that manifesto
for now? What are the (issues)
you see as critical?"
Howard Brick, the confer-
ence's organizer, said he was
pleased with Hayden's address
and the crowd's response.
"There was a spirit and enthu-
siasm that I thoughtwas remark-
able," Brick said. "Tom speaks in
a way that's capable of keeping
the spirit alive."
Public Policy senior Michael
Bloom said he thought the event
was phenomenal.
"Tom Hayden was obviously
a revolutionary figure and the
Port Huron Statement was really
a milestone in activism through-
out the country, especially here
at Michigan," Bloom said.
LSA junior Theresa Johnson
said she came to the event after
she read the statement in her
American Culture class, and was
interested in learning more.
"I think (the statement) still
plays a role in today's society
and beingunified," Johnson said.
"Especially with the election
comingup, and havingyourvoice
heard when you want it to be."

"I doubt if I asked how many
people knew what parts of the
Michigan Constitution could be
wiped out by this provision, that
there are many people in this
room," he said. "I doubt there
are many people that can walk
through the 170 laws and really
understand all the consequences
of what could happen if they get
wiped-out."
Snyder has previously said he
opposes Proposal 3, which would
place renewable energy require-
ments in the state constitution,
because he finds lawmaking to be
a better alternative to a constitu-
tional amendment.
He also opposes Proposal
6, which would establish need
for a popular vote to begin con-
struction of the proposed bridge
between Detroit and Canada, on
grounds that the crossing would
clearly benefit Michigan. He
added that Ambassador Bridge

owner Matty Moroun has poi-
soned public opinion on the
bridge.
When asked how he can be so
assured that Michigan taxpayers
would not bear any taxburden for
the proposed bridge, he deferred
to Roy Norton, Canada's consul
general of Canada in Detroit.
Norton told the audience that
he would have preferred the state
gather the fundsto split the fund-
ing for the bridge, as did Maine
and New York.
However, after Snyder's attempt
to allocate the funds died in the
state Legislature, the Canadian
government decided the project
was importantenoughforittofoot
the entire bill, Norton said.
"We aren't in the habit, I
should say, as a country, of
offering free infrastructure to
developed countries, but in this
particular case it's so important
that we ... had no choice," Norton
joked.
Support for the six ballot ini-
tiatives has fluctuated over the
last several months. Proposal
1, the referendum on the emer-
gency financial manager law, has
earned support from 35 percent

of Michigan residents and disap-
proval from 43 percent, accord-
ing to a poll released Thursday by
WXYZ-TV and the Detroit Free
Press.
Meanwhile, Proposal 4, which
would establish a limited collec-
tive bargaining agreement for in-
home health care workers - and
which was only lightly discussed
Thursday night - is too close to
call, according to a poll from the
two news organizations. The poll
reported that 44 percent of likely
voters oppose the proposal, while
42 percent approve of it and 11
percent are still undecided.
The closeness of the vote on
some of the six ballot propos-
als, and what Snyder said was a
wealth of misinformation, have
pulled Snyder across the state in a
campaign to boost his "Say Yes to
One, No to the Rest" stance.
On Thursday, Snyder stopped
in Livonia, Sterling Heights and
Lake Orion and held an online
web chat with The Oakland Press
before arriving here. The stops
were part of a bus tour named for
his perspective on the six propos-
als.
At the governor's final stop

in Detroit, Stephen Clark, the
WXYZ-TV anchor, praised Sny-
der for his transparency, telling
members of the audience that he
did not know another governor
who was as open with the citi-
zens of their state.
University alum Jacob Cohen,
a part-time University Law stu-
dent, came with what he called
"instincts" about his voting deci-
sion. He said he left with more
resolution about how he would
vote, pointing to Snyder's clarity
on his positions.
Cohen said he came to view
the referendum on the emergency
financial manager law as the less-
er of two evils between an emer-
gency financial manager installed
by Snyder - an elected official -
and a federal bankruptcy judge.
He said he also sided with Sny-
der's caution in deciding whether
initiatives have a place in the state
constitution.
"It was great to hear really sub-
stantive answers from someone
when all you see on TV are tag-
lines and things that don't make
much sense," Cohen said in an
interview after the event. "You
have to talk about these issues in

long-form to understand the actu-
al issue underlying the proposal.
You don't get that from TV ads."
Still, some attendees of the
townhallsaid they were unmoved
by Snyder's arguments and unim-
pressed by his willingness to
answer audience questions.
Sarah Grieb - a fellow at Chal-
lenge Detroit, a group that has
worked to educate voters on the
proposals and emphasizes the
facilitation of democracy - said
she was unimpressed with Sny-
der's answers.
"He was telling people how to
vote," Grieb said in an interview
after the event. "I don't think
that people got more informed by
coining here tonight."
Jacqueline Smith, a West-
ern Michigan University alum
and another fellow at Challenge
Detroit, added that she hoped
attendees would seek an alter-
nate perspective on the ballots,
whether or not they were per-
suaded by Snyder.
"I just think it's important that
people do their own research,
because it's easy to just look at
the ads and not really inform
yourself."

his upcoming film, which enters
wide release on Friday.
"All of these different ways of
expressing myself is like what
Bruce Lee would say, 'express
yourself fully,"' RZA said, giving
a big-smiled laugh. "And that's
what I feel like I'm doing. I'm not
gonna let anybody stop me from
doing that."
Growing up in poverty in New
York City, RZA digested count-
less hours of martial arts films.
Though separated by thousands
of miles and several millennia,
RZA discovered himself spiritu-
ally connected to ancient Chinese
culture.
More than entertain-
ment - more. than escapism
- these movies provided a spiri-
tual framework within which he
learned to express himself, he

said. He draws inspiration for
his music and "The Man with the
Iron Fists" from the "same well."
"Sometimes, I think of being
ferocious like a tiger, but nim-
ble as a crane. As deceptive as a
snake, you know what I mean?,"
he explained. "These types of
ideas I apply to music, I apply to
my daily life, you know - I live
martial. Bruce Lee would say,
'forget the form, be like water."'
As a child, RZA was a zealot for
martial arts films. It wasn't until
he met Quentin Tarantino dur-
ing the filming of "Kill Bill: Vol.
1" that RZA became a student of
the art. Under the tutelage of the
mind behind "Pulp Fiction," he
was exposed to film that wouldn't
have otherwise been possible,
that would only add to his "well."
During this time, RZA became
acquainted with Eli Roth, the
acclaimed horror director of
"Cabin Fever," and discovered
that both their fathers attended


the same public school. Togeth- classic '70s and '80s -era Shaw

O I-E IA
Vote Johnson,
Kelley and McCormack
ne of the unsung sections of this year's ballot entails the race
for Michigan's Supreme Court. Unbeknownst to many, $10
million has been spent on television ads by the two major
political parties on the Supreme Court race. The current Supreme
Court is controlled 4-3 by conservative justices, so the outcome of
this election will have a major effect on many state decisions, as it
supervises and regulates other courts.

Beyond disillusionment

Since this presidential cam-
paign began 18 months ago,
there's been a narrative that
hasn't seemed to go away. By now,
we're all famil-
iar with the
popular refrain
- the disillu-
sioned youth
who once upon
a time volun-
teered and voted
for President YONAH
Barack Obama. LIEBERMAN
The 2008
campaign was
the first time I really engaged in
politics. I wasn't old enough to vote,
hut I'm proud to say I got caught
up in the empowering slogans of
"Change" and "Yes We Can." I sud-
denly found myself in Richmond,
va. as a community organizer, ral-
lying support from door to door.
Imagine that: a well-off, Jew-
ish, private-school kid talking to
impoverished black people. It was
inspiring work.
But wait! Before you all shove
this paper into the recycling bin,
I promise not to bore you with all
of Obama's accomplishments and
Republican presidential nominee
Mitt Romney's dangerous posi-
tions. That's overdone.
There's an oft-overlooked, yet
important demographic on campus:
people from all backgrounds who
may not vote - those of you who are
no longer inspired by the soaring
rhetoric and incredible atmosphere
of "the first time." That is, the first
time that Obama ran for president.
I know from experience that
many pundits' blanket statements
of disillusionment are entirely
false. I saw it first-hand in Denver
when I was a field organizer for the
Obama campaign last summer, and
I've seen it all across this campus
these past two months.
But, yes, there are many who
have lost faith - who, as the pun-
dits say, are "disillusioned."

Look, I get it. I really, really do.
There are many things I am frus-
trated at Obama for not doing in
his first term. He failed to achieve
immigration reform, fight for the
public option in health care reform,
pull our troops out of Afghanistan,
create more green jobs, reinvigorate
the peace process between Israelis
and Palestinians or close Guantana-
mo Bay. He continued the Bush tax
cuts on the wealthy and increased
the drone strikes in the Middle East.
And yet, my issue isn't entirely
with the president, but with the sys-
tem in which he functions. My issue
isn't entirely with the lack of prog-
teas, but with the institutions in
place that make true progress diffi-
cult. My issue isn't entirely with the
change that we didn't see, but with a
government that makes changes far
too slowly.
Clearly, I have major qualms
with the president's first term. We
shouldn't ignore these issues, and
we shouldn't simply forgive his
transgressions. We should engage
with them.
To engage is to act publicly when
we disagree. This could mean taking
to the streets, lobbying our congres-
sional representatives, writing to the
White House or - as Obama once did
- doing some real community orga-
nizing. To engage is not to check out.
That shouldn't be an option.
Every activist eventually learns
that change is slow. It took 10 years
after the Montgomery Bus Boycott
for the Civil Rights Act of 1965 to
become law. It took 35 years after
the 1969 Stonewall riots for Massa-
chusetts to become the first state to
legalize same-sex marriage.
We live in an imperfect world gov-
erned by imperfect institutions. Our
Electoral College is imperfect. Our
two-party system is imperfect. Our
campaign finance laws are imper-
fect. Our politics are imperfect.
If we want change, throwing up
our hands when confronted with
these imperfections isn't an option.

We need to roll up our sleeves.
The sweeping change we wanted
so badly in 2008 may have been
represented by Democratic presi-
dential nominee Obama, but he was
never going to achieve it all with
his hands alone. We cannot sit back
and watch. If we stop working for
change, it drifts that much farther
out of reach.
Take heart, get
out of bed, and
go to the polls.
We shouldn't forgetour emotions
the night Barack Obama became
president-elect. We can't push aside
the hope we felt simply because
change is slow. There's too much at
stake. There are too many policiwes
that still need to be changed.
I refuse to tell my grandchildren
that my generation's strength and
unity dissolved in disillusionment.
I reject the narrative that paints
the 2008 election as the high-water
mark of our movement for change.
There are valid reasons to be dis-
appointed in Obama's first term. But
there's no excuse not to vote for a sec-
ond term. There is no reason why we
cannot come together again as agen-
eration of change-seekers and hope-
mongers, starting with Election.Day.
When you wake up on Nov. 6,
remember how you felt "the last
time." And remember that while
change may be slow, change will
only come if, after we vote, we keep
on working.

McCormack is a former faculty fellow at Yale
Law School and the associate dean for clinical
affairs at the University's Law School. She has
participated in the Law School's clinics and
formed her own, the Domestic violence Litiga-
tion Clinic and the Pediatric Health Advocacy
Clinic. McCormack became the Dean for Clini-
cal Affairs in 2002.
McCormack is a teacher of law and an
advocate for justice. In an interview with
Michigan Radio, she said that if elected she
would "apply the law set by the political
branches of government, to provide stability
and promise equal treatment to all of our citi-
zens." McCormack is an advocate of due pro-
cess of law in all cases, and even volunteered
to defend a prisoner held in Guantanamo Bay
during the Bush administration.
She also told Michigan Radio thatshe's "real-
ly committed to the important, independent
role the court plays inour constitutional democ-
racy." Most importantly, however, McCormack
is committed to the community and believes
that the Court has a unique responsibility and
function within it.
Connie Kelley, a veteran of law for 27 years,
serves on the Wayne County Circuit Court.
Elected to the 3rd Circuit Court in 2008, Kel-
ley's term has been characterized by fairness
and consideration of both sides of arguments.
An Oct. 9 article in The Michigan Chronicle
described Kelley as family activist who looks
after the rights of children. As Kelley said dur-
ing the interview, one of the justices retiring
this year, Justice Marilyn Kelly, is the only
justice serving the state of Michigan to have
experience in family law. Kelley also serves as
a mentor for young women at Cody High School
in Detroit. In another interview, Kelley identi-
fied herself as someone who believes in trans-

parency of the law: "We believe that justice
should be for everybody and the justice system
should be accessible to everybody."
Two Republican opponents, Oakland County
Circuit Judge Colleen O'Brien, and Justice Ste-
phen Markman, have made questionable deci-
sions as judges. O'Brien sentenced a man who
raped an 11-year-old boy to one year in prison
and four years of probation; this is clearly not
a harsh enough sentence. Justice Markman
has consistently voted conservatively in many
cases. For example, in Pride at Work v. the Gov-
ernor of Michigan, Markman ruled that Michi-
gan's gay marriage ban also bars same-sex
domestic partners who are public employees
from receiving health insurance benefits.
For the half-term Supreme Court position,
Judge Sheila Johnson is running against Jus-
tice Brian Zahra. Johnson is a graduate of the
University of Michigan Law School.and has
served as the judge of 46th District Court for
nine years. She has worked as both a trial judge
and as a lawyer, giving her experience from
both sides. Justice Zahra was appointed to the
Michigan Supreme Court by Governor Rick
Snyder in 201. Zahra, like Markman, voted to
reject same-sexbenefits.
McCormack, Kelley and Johnson have the
skill to maintain jurisprudence in Michigan.
Both have opposed unprecedented campaign
contributions that took place in the 2010
Supreme Court elections and onward after
the Citizens United case. vote Bridget Mary
McCormack, Judge Connie Kelley and
Judge Sheila Johnson for Michigan Supreme
Court. Kelley will provide the necessary expe-
rience with regards to family litigation, McCor-
mack brings academic reflection to the judicial
bench and Johnson brings experience from her
range of careers.

F ROM T HE DA ILY
Vote Dingell, Stabenow
Jn a partisan campaign of Super Bowl proportions, former U.S.
Rep. Pete Hoekstra is the Republican challenging Democratic
incumbent Sen. Debbie Stabenow to represent Michigan in
the U.S. Senate. Hoekstra is adamant that his initiatives are a vast
improvement over his contender's. In an interview with The Michi-
gan Daily, he summarized five key items that form the focal point
of his candidacy: achieving American energy independence, revis-
ing our tax code, privatizing our country's health care industry,
improving our educational system and balancing the budget.

Hoekstra's goals mark a good starting point,
but he failed to sufficiently explain the means
by which he plans to achieve them in the Sen-
ate. Most troubling were his presumptuous
statements about the current quality of the
American health care system.
"America's health care is imperfect, but
imperfect as it is, it's still the best health care
system in the world, and I don't want to put it
in aposition where it's controlledby the federal
government," Hoekstra said.
While it's true Americahas excellenthealth
care, it's by no means the "best health care
system in the world," even compared to some
of our closest neighbors. Per-capita health
care spending in the U.S. is nearly twice that
of Canada's and exceeds any other country in
the world. In spite of the high expenditures,
however, the World Health Organization
ranked U.S. health care 37th worldwide, well
below the other industrialized countries and
some developing countries.
When asked whether he and his Repub-
lican cohorts had earned back their seats in
government in the wake of the Bush admin-
istration's missteps, Hoekstra pointed to the
current administration as an example of a
more recent failure.
This is a striking example of Hoekstra's
tendency to take the path of least resistance,
harping on the shortcomings of his opponents
rather than emphasizing his own campaign's
strengths. Thiswas evenmore clearly observed
in hiswidely panned, racially insensitive Super
Bowl campaign advertisement, which criti-

cized Debbie "Spenditnow" for her alleged sup-
port of moving jobs overseas.
Stabenow's interview with the Daily
focused more on her efforts to strike a com-
promise between parties. She has made a
positive impact with her position as chair-
woman on the Committee on Agriculture,
Nutrition and Forestry. She also underscored
her role as a "champion of advanced manu-
facturing and new technologies," a support-
er of the national auto industry and a chief
figure in a $23-billion reduction of wasteful
spending in the agricultural industry.
Though her voting record lacks perfect
consistency, Stabenow is the most qualified
candidate for U.S. Senate not only for her
abstention from extreme rhetoric, but also
due to the firm precedent she's set with a
12-year tenure as a senator. vote Sen. Debbie
Stabenow for U.S. Senate.
In the U.S. House of Representatives, Rep.
John Dingell faces Cynthia Kallgren to con-
tinue his record-long service as congressman.
Dingell's 57-year career, the longest in House
history, is studded with remarkable contribu-
tions, including his crucial role in uncovering
numerous cases of political corruption and
fraud. Duringa candidateforum at Weber's Inn
on Oct. 10, Dingell was able to cite numerous
examples of political service, while Kallgren's
only managerial experience is derived from
her role as a consultant for a company called
Creative Memories. Dingell's record speaks
for itself -vote Rep. John Dingell for the U.S.
House of Representatives.

If you're a Michigan voter, you
have an important decision to
make on Nov. 6. Will you stand on
the side of working families and
on the side of democracy, dignity
and fairness for all workers by vot-
ing yes on Proposal 2?
We, as your GSIs and as officers,
stewards and members of the Gradu-
ate Employees' Organization, have
worked hard to ensure you are able
to make this decision for our state,
rather than the CEos and politicians
who have launched dozens of legis-
lative actions stripping workers of
their right to organize and bargain
collectively. We urge you to vote yes
on Proposal 2.
You might have seen a few of
the attack advertisements that
circulate outright lies about what
this constitutional amendment
will mean for Michigan. These
commercials try to portray edu-
cators as evil criminals out to
harm children and steal taxpayer
money, instead of folks just try-
ing to take care of their families,
be treated fairly at work and make
our communities a better place
to live. These advertisements are
examples of the most basic kind of
discourse that does not even both-
er to rise to the level of informed
debate - you couldn't get away
with argumentation like this in
your English 125 essays. But the
adverts aren't fooling the people
who matter. Parents and informed
citizens know that collective bar-
gaining builds our communities
and protects students. That's why
groups like the Michigan PTA
have endorsed Proposal 2.
Before you make your decision,

you might have a few questions.
What is collective bargaining?
In a political climate that vilifies
working people, it's easy to for-
get that collective bargaining is
simply when two or more workers
come together with their employer
to negotiate hours, compensation
and working conditions. Work-
ers democratically decide among
themselves what to bargain for and
often address safety, quality stan-
dards and due process in hiring and
firing in their contracts. Many of
the basic workplace rights and pro-
tections we take for granted today
are the result of decades of collec-
tive bargaining efforts: the basic
40-hour work week, the weekend
break, minimum wage and child
labor laws.
Maybe your question is, "What
does the right to bargain collectively
have to do with me and my future?"
You might not be a union member
when you graduate, but your work-
ing conditions will be affected by
the standards that bargaining sets.
All workers gain because the wages,
benefits, working conditions and
safety procedures laid out in collec-
tively bargained contracts become
standards that other employers must
meet to stay competitive. Our com-
munities grow stronger because fair
wages allow us to support local busi-
nesses, fund our schools adequately
and keep safety services strong. Con=
versely, when workers don't have a
voice, we all lose. Politicians are roll-
ing back current laws that protect
wages, hours and safe working con-
ditions. We can't wait until our rights
are completely gone - we need to
protect them now.

There's a classic labor movement
* song that you might have heard
played at our rally with lecturers and
other community members support-
ing Proposal 2 last Friday. The lyrics
ask a simple question: Which side are
you on?
As we teach you in our dis-
cussion sections, rarely is such a
reductive question the right one
to ask. There are multiple sides to
every issue - and that's exactly
why teachers need a seat at the
table when decisions that affect
the quality of their students' edu-
cation are being discussed. Nurses
need to know they can't be fired for
raising safety concerns in hospitals
that are increasingly run for profit
at the patient's expense. All work-
ers need a seat at the table when
wages and benefits are being dis-
cussed. Collective bargaining gives
workers a say in these crucial deci-
sions that directly affect the lives
of their students, their patients and
their communities.
Yet in a time when the basic
democratic rights of working
people are under attack by politi-
cians and CEos who rake in record
profits for themselves while keep-
ing wages stagnant, the question
before you is simple: Which side
are you on? A vote for Proposal 2 is
a vote for the right for workers to
have a seat at the table, to have a
say in their working conditions and
to be respected for the labor and
skills they-bring to their jobs every
single day.
This viewpoint was written by Liz
Rodrigues and other members of the
Graduate Employees' Organization.

Wolverines blow past
Wildcats in exhibition

Albrecht, freshman excel early

By EVERETT COOK
Daily Sports Editor
It's hard to draw conclu-
sions from preseason basketball
games, especially for a Michigan
basketball team that has the hype
of the No. 5 team in the nation
playing against a Northern
Michigan team that went 9-17 in
Division II
last year. N M GU 47
There are MICHIGAN 83
takeaways
from these preseason games,
but again, it's only an exhibition
game.
Still, even though it's Novem-
ber and even though it was
against Northern Michigan, it
was easy to tell on Thursday
night that this Michigan team,
from top to bottom, can really
shoot. And even that might be an
understatement.
Michigan shot 42-percent
from beyond three point range
en route to a 83-47 win over the
Wildcats in its' exhibition open-
er. The game was never close, as
the Wolverines started off the
game on a 17-0 run - and that
was only their first 17-0 run of
the night.
The first three and a half min-
utes of the game started like this
for the Wolverines: 3-pointer,
3-pointer, 3-point play, 3-pointer,
3-pointer. Five possessions, 15
points.
"That was really big for our
team," freshman forward Glenn
Robinson III said. "I think it got
everyone going, especially for me
and Spike (Albrecht) being the
two freshman out there, I think
that that calmed our nerves a lit-
tle going into the game. We just
found our rhythm as a team."
Albrecht, the freshman point
guard, had six of those 15 points,
showing off some of the skills the
veteran Wolverines promised the
unheralded freshman would dis-
play early on. Albrecht was thrust

New Crisler Center. New uni-
forms. New point guard, at least
temporarily.
Entering Thursday night's
exhibition opener against lowly
Division-II Northern Michigan,
the focus easily could've centered
on what was unveiled before the
game's tip-off. The flashy and
vibrant Crisler concourse was
revealed to the public for the first
time, but the spotlight was shift-
ed instead to freshman point
guard Spike Albrecht, starting
in place of suspended sophomore
Trey Burke.
Like Burke last year, Albrecht
showed the poise of a grizzled
vet, hiding any sign of inexperi-
ence in the Wolverines' convinc-
ing 83-47 victory.
Albrecht knocked down a
3-pointer 51 seconds into the
game, moments later assisted on
a 3-point make from freshman
forward Glenn Robinson III and
thenlofted ina floaterthathitthe
bottom of the net and sent him to
the line, where he completed the
three-point play.
Michigan coach John Beilein
spoke highly of Albrecht, com-
paring the Crown Pointe, Ind.
native to famous NFL quarter-
backs Doug Flutie, Joe Theis-
mann and Joe Montana.
"They don't pass the eyeball
test for an NFL quarterback,
but somehow they get things
done," Beilein said. "He certainly
doesn't pass the test, but he con-
tinues to be productive.
"He surprises me every day.
He just plays out there. ... He
makes you smile to watch him
play, and everybody just says,
'How'd he do that?' Well, I don't
know either."
Before the Wildcats scored
a single point - or Michigan
missed a field goal - the Wol-
verines jumped to a 17-0 lead,
with the two freshmen starters
accountingfor 12 of the points.
"We just started rolling,"
Albrecht said. "It felt good (to)
get in there and get your feet wet

Freshman point guard Spike Albrecht scored 16 points against NMU.

a little bit, for all of us, actually.
We had great energy. We .came
out, got out to a nice little run,
and it was smooth sailing from
there."
Albrecht finished with 16
points and six assists, while
turningthe ball overjusttwice in
30 minutes. Robinson added 13.
"Wow," a wide-eyed Robin-
son said of the experience. "It
was like nothing else. (Michigan
assistant coach Bacari Alexan-
der) told me to just go out there
and have fun and that's what I
wanted to do. Once I saw (the
crowd), I knew it was going to be
a great night."
Freshman guard Nik Stauskas
also wasted little time putting
points on the board. The sharp-
shooter spotted up in the cor-
ner and drilled a three just six
seconds after checking into the
game. He finished with agame-
high 17 points - in just 19 min-
utes - thanks to 4-of-6 shooting
from deep.
Freshman forward Mitch
McGary added five points and
nine rebounds, but it was his
energy and willingness to draw
a charge and dive for balls that

reminded Beilein of anoth-
er Chesterton product, Zack
Novak.
"That's indigenous,' appar-
ently, to Chesterton," he said.
"They're tough kids. I would
think you'll see him dive a lot,
during this, time. That's a big
man putting his life on the line
to dive, but we'll take it every
time."
The final freshman, guard
Caris LeVert, knocked down a
3-pointer for his only points.
At one point, Beilein got so
caught up in making sure that
everyone played enough minutes
that he unknowingly sent all five
freshmen to the scorer's table to
check in at the same time. It was
the first time the highly-touted
recruiting class played together
on one unit in a7Michigan uni-
form, including during practice.
"We sat down at the score-
board - all five of us checked in
at the same time - and we kind
of looked at each other," Robin-
son said. "I said, 'Let's go. This
is our time. Let's givethe fans
something to watch and to talk
about.' I think that's what we
did."

Shawn Hunwick took a swing at

"I don't think we'll have that

Hunwick might've been a bit of
a target last year, and he made
a mistake last year. We've got
a new team, they've got a new

What the Wolverines will
have on their hands, however, is a
much-improved Wildcats squad
that endured a painful sweep at
the hands of No. 7 Notre Dame
last weekend. In those games,
No. 20 Northern Michigan fell

According to senior captain
A.J. Treais, the adjustment
should come naturally to Michi-
gan.
"I think it works to our advan-
tage," Treais said. "We've got a
lot of guys that can fly and a lot
of guys that can drive wide so ... I
think we'll be fine."
This weekend marks the Wol-
verines' first road test of the
young season, and away games
certainly troubled Michigan last
year - it went 5-6-3 in true road
contests.
Berenson said the upperclass-
men carry a lot of the burden
of making sure "team talk" is

focused, and younger players
understand the difficulties of
playing on the road.
"None of these games any-
more are gimmies," Treais said.
"Especially with it being our first
road test, it'll be interesting to
see how we respond there."
Michigan will play without
two of its defensemen, neither of
whom will make the trip to Mar-
quette.
Junior Jon Merrill has been
sidelined since he cracked a ver-
tebrae in an Oct. 9 exhibition,
and sophomore Brennan Serville
is out with what Berenson is call-
ing a "facial concussion."
With only six defensemen
available for the two games, the
weekend will be a test of the
defensive corps' resilience and
depth.

Quarterback a question vs. Minny

By ZACH HELFAND
Daily Sports Editor
As usual, Michigan coach
Brady Hoke spoke this week in a
stream of staccatos, punctuated
by a heavy serving of periods
and peppered with colloquial-
isms that didn't reveal much. He
favored phrases like "we'll see"
and spoke often in the condi-

terback Denard Rtobinson should

of uncertainty, Hoke rendered
no certainties of his own. Robin-
son should play Saturday against
Minnesota, despite a nerve inju-
ry to his right elbow, Hoke said.
His status, though, might not
be decided until kickoff. Junior
wide receiver Devin Gardner
has taken the bulk of the reps at
quarterback, but redshirt fresh-
man Russell Bellomy could still
get the nod.
"(Robinson's) better," Hoke
said on Wednesday, adding that
Michigan is planning on him
starting.
"It's not all the way cleared up
yet, but it's better."
Hoke said he didn't think
Robinson would sit out, saying,
"We're counting on him," but
he noted that he could make the
decision as late as the kickoff on
Saturday.
Suddenly, the game itself has
been thrust into uncertainty by
the fragile right elbow of Michi-
gan's star.
With Robinson in the game,
Minnesota (1-3 Big Ten, 5-3
overall) is no match for Michi-
gan, on paper at least. Michigan
(3-1, 5-3) rolled to a 58-0 vic-
tory in last year's skirmish for
the Little Brown Jug. Without
Robinson, though, the game is
as as questionable as Bellomy's
arm or Gardner's transition back
from receiver, both major ques-
tion marks.

Redshirt junior kicker Brendan
Gibbons has six field goals the last
two weeks, including a career long
52-yarder against Nebraska. With
junior Will Hagerup continuing
to boom his punts, the Wolverines
might have one of the top specialist
duos in the country.
Minnesota isn't nearly as strong
in this department. Kicker Jordan
Wettstein is 9-for-16 on field goals
this season, and the Gophers aren't
great in any other department
either.
Edge: Michigan
Intangibles
Yes, this is technically a rivalry
game, and both teams want to
win the Jug. But its one-sidedness
means it lacks the passion and
intensity typical of most rivalries,
so there shouldn't be any signifi-
cant impactfrom that aspect.
Give the slight advantage to
Minnesota, just because of the
mental lift the Gophers will get
if Robinson can't play and since
they're likely highly motivated to
avenge the 58-0 drubbing the Wol-
verines gave them last season.

EVENT PREVIEW
Film series to show
Romanian culture

Jazz to fill Kerrytown
during annual Edgefest

Screenings and
lectures to explore
cinematic diversity
By CARLINA DUAN
For the Daily
As November hits, so does the
crunch of leaves, bulky sweaters,
the seasonal flair for pumpkin-*
themed drinks.
Add to this Fourth
year's autumn: Annual
Romanian film.
The Fourth Romanian
Annual Roma- Film Series
nian Film
Series, which Saturdayand
begins Saturday, Sunday and
will spotlight Nov.17 and
four Romanian- 18at4 p.m.
produced films Helmut Stern
over the course Auditorum
of two week-
ends. As a part Free
of the American
RomanianFestival, the film series
intends to illuminate aspects of
modern Romanian culture and its
art forms to audiences.
According to Ramona Urites-
cu-Lombard, a lecturer in the
Comparative Literature and Ger-
manic Languages & Literatures
Departments, filmgoers this sea-
son might be drawn to new Roma-
nian cinema - a field wrapped
in avid curiosity and trademark
"Romanian black humor," which
she described as "a sort of wit that
manifested itself during commu-
nism."
According to Uritescu-Lom-
bard, the film coordinator for
the series, the films, which fea-
ture emerging filmmakers and
critically acclaimed films by more
established Romanian directors,
were chosen in order to portray
Romania as operating within the
larger global community.
"It isn't so much the feeling
that Romania is still a world apart,
that it's still cut off," she said. "No.
Now, Romania is one country
among other cultures, and so the
issues that some of our films deal
with are international issues."
Uritescu-Lombard added,
"There is still a Romanian con-
text, but there's no longer the feel-
ing that this is an isolated world
apart."

day After Christmas" (Nov. 4),
"Philantrophy" (Nov. 17) and
"The Phantom Father" (Nov. i8)
- will be accompanied by post-
screeninglectures inorder tohelp
audiences enhance their compre-
hension of the films. All films will
be shown in Romanian with Eng-
lish subtitles.
Lecturers include "Outbound"
director Bogdan George Ape-
tri, LSA Comparative Literature
Professor Dr. Corina Kesler and
Uritescu-Lombard.
"As a member of the audience
myself, I like a bit of introduction
after a film," Uritescu-Lombard
said. "It helps me understand
things better, and makes the
experience of viewing a film or
seeing a film more pleasurable
because I get more of it."
In addition, she said films seem
to appeal more to audiences, cre-
ating a fresh channel for audienc-
es to delve into.
"We live in a. visual culture.
That's what has immediate
appeal," she said. "A lot of people
are maybe better readers of film,
or better viewers of film than
they are viewers of books, and
are more frequent readers of film
than they are of books."
The American Romanian Fes-
tival itself is a larger nonprofit
organization based in southeast-
ern Michigan. The festival hosts
annual events, aimed to encour-
age an appreciation of Romanian
culture for the larger community
in the U.S.

"As with anysmaller culture or
lesser well-known culture, such
as Romania, we all hope to gain a
wider audience and appreciation
and whatever cultural products
we put out there," Uritescu-Lom-
bard said. "Perhaps by showing
these films we might pique peo-
ples' interests."
American Romanian Festival
president Marian Tanau began
the group in 2005 as a way to
build interaction and apprecia-
tionforthe Romanian community
and its culture.
"The way we accomplish
understanding (of Romanian cul-
ture) is by presenting a wide vari-
ety of events - such as classical
music by Romanian composers
that have not been heard of here
in the U.S., or we have an artist
that we feature," Tanau said. "The
goal is to present an ensemble, a
picture of the culture."-
The festival presents annu-
al orchestral concerts, lecture
series, cooking. lessons and a
film series, spreading its events
throughout the course of each
year in order to raise awareness of
Romanian culture.
Tanau commended the role of
film as an ideal medium to com-
municate aspects of. Romanian
culture.
"A film has musical elements, it
has habitual elements, and it has
literature elements," he said. "So
all of a sudden, in two hours, you
expose the audience to many sides
of a culture presented in a film."

"It grew organically out of

beginning to flourish in New

Director Deanna Relyea.
