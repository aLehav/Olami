The Graduate Employees’ 

Organization, 
which 

represents more than 2,000 
graduate student instructors 
and graduate student staff 
assistants, announced Monday 
that its members have voted 
to strike in response to the 
University of Michigan’s fall 
reopening plans. This move 
could 
substantially 
disrupt 

academic operations through 
the course of next week. This is 

the first GEO strike since 1975.

In 
a 
press 
release 

announcing the strike, which 
is set to begin Tuesday, GEO 
noted 
the 
gravity 
of 
the 

decision. According to the 
release, 79 percent of GEO 
voters supported the work 
stoppage.

“This is an historic moment; 

GEO membership has voted 
to strike in the middle of a 
pandemic at the beginning 
of the academic year, and is 
prepared to withhold our labor 
in pursuit of a safe and just 
campus for all,” the statement 

read.

In a Twitter thread outlining 

its plans, GEO said the union 
will hold an emergency virtual 
general membership meeting 
Monday night ahead of the 
strike, 
which 
will 
feature 

both in-person and remote 
components. 

“Much of our picketing will 

be in person, and we’ll make 
sure that safety is paramount. 
Masks are required, and we’ll 
be physically distant on the 
picket line,” one tweet read.

Graduate Employees’ Organization members held a “die-in” on the Diag to protest the University’s reopening.

A program started in the 1970s 

to help Black students adjust to life 
at the University of Michigan — a 
predominately white institution 
— has become increasingly white 
itself in recent years.

The Summer Bridge Scholars 

Program grew out of Black 
student activism at the University 
and 
was 
created 
for 
Black 

students. But in recent years, 
white students made up the 
largest portion of the program’s 

participants, 
according 
to 

Kierra Trotter, director of the 
Comprehensive Studies Program.

To Black students like LSA 

sophomore Rhianna Womack, a 
Bridge participant in 2019, the 
changing demographics of the 
program are disheartening.

“Having 
something 
made 

for you because of all of the 
historical … discrimination, but 
then seeing that one thing being 
taken away or being limited, it’s 
pretty messed up,” Womack said. 
“It’s something that a lot of white 
students even don’t understand.”

Established in 1975, the Bridge 

program 
emerged 
from 
the 

efforts of Black student activists 
in the 1960s and 1970s. Students 
held protests demanding that the 
University increase Black student 
enrollment to 10 percent — a 
goal that administration never 
achieved.

As a result of these and other 

protests, Black faculty fought 
for the creation of programs 
like the Comprehensive Studies 
Program and Bridge that focused 
on Black students’ education and 
transition into the University.

Four women allege
sexual misconduct against 
former Michigan tight end
Mustapha Muhammad

Content 
warning: 
This 
story 

contains descriptions of alleged sexual 
misconduct, and may be distressing for 
some readers.

In the summer of 2018, Addy Walker 

found herself alone with Mustapha 
Muhammad in his Alice Lloyd dorm 
room. At the time, Muhammad was an 
incoming freshman on the Michigan 
football team. He was also in Walker’s 
Comprehensive Studies Program.

A few hours earlier, Walker had 

confided in Muhammad that she was 
a survivor of sexual assault. She had 
shown him and a few other friends a 
tattoo on her left forearm inspired by 
one Lady Gaga got in solidarity with 
other sexual assault survivors. 

In 
an 
interview 
with 
The 

Michigan Daily, Walker, now an LSA 
sophomore, said Muhammad began 
their encounter by kissing her with 
her consent. But she alleged that he 
soon began touching her without her 
consent.

“He got on top of me and got really 

aggressive,” Walker said. “ … And I said 
no many times. ‘No, no, no, stop. No, 
no.’ And he would not stop.”

Walker 
remembers 
Muhammad 

bringing up his status as a football 
player in response to her repeatedly 
saying “no.”

“Really, you don’t want to do it with 

a U of M football player?” she recalls 
him saying. 

Walker told her roommate about 

the 
incident 
soon 
after 
leaving 

Muhammad’s dorm room. They both 
decided Walker should not report 
the alleged sexual misconduct to the 
University — they feared Muhammad’s 
standing as an incoming football player 
would affect the school’s response.

In an interview with The Daily, 

Walker’s roommate recalled their 
conversation 
about 
potentially 

reporting 
the 
incident. 
Walker’s 

roommate requested anonymity, citing 
privacy concerns.

“Because he was a football player … 

she was scared what would happen if 
she had spoken about it, whether it be 
him hurting her … (or) any retaliation 
from 
the 
University,” 
Walker’s 

roommate said.

Walker is not alone. An investigation 

by The Daily uncovered four previously 
undisclosed 
allegations 
against 

Muhammad ranging from sexual 
harassment to misconduct, including 
stalking dorm residents and unwanted 
touching.

The Daily also found evidence 

the University was made aware of at 
least two of these alleged incidents in 
January 2019 in a report submitted to 
residence hall staff about accusations 
of sexual harassment. It is unclear if 
the University began an investigation 
into this report or if a finding was ever 
reached.

Muhammad 
did 
not 
reply 
to 

multiple texts and emails from The 
Daily requesting comment for this 
article.

Another 
female 
dorm 
resident 

alleged 
that 
she 
had 
a 
similar 

experience with Muhammad a few 
months after Walker. This former 
resident requested anonymity, citing 
privacy concerns. In this article, she 
will be referred to as Jane.

Jane first met Muhammad during 

the summer term. She lived near him in 
Alice Lloyd Residence Hall — her room 
was across the hall from Walker’s. 

One night in November 2018, 

Muhammad 
invited 
Jane 
to 
his 

dorm room in West Quad Residence 
Hall. His roommate was out for the 
weekend. They began watching a 

movie together.

“He was just, like, asking me 

questions, like if I had a boyfriend, was 
I interested in having a boyfriend,” 
Jane recalled. “And I just said I wasn’t 
really interested.”

About 20 minutes later, Jane alleged 

that Muhammad began touching her 
arms.

“He was … touching my arms and 

my stomach,” Jane said. “And then he, 
like, as time (progressed) … he kept 
moving to places I didn’t want to be 
touched.”

Jane 
remembered 
repeatedly 

motioning for Muhammad to stop 
touching her.

“Every time I would try to move 

his hands, he would move them back,” 
Jane said. “And then eventually it just 
got to the point where he actually, like, 
put my hands on his penis. And I was 
just like, I’m not — that’s not cool.”

Jane left Muhammad’s dorm room 

that night determined never to speak 
with him again. Though she continued 
to see him around campus and some of 
her friends continued to interact with 
him, she avoided speaking with him at 
all costs.

Jane remembers struggling to share 

her story with her friends. In the few 
instances that she did tell her story to 
someone else, they said they had heard 
similar rumors about Muhammad.

“I told a few friends, not in detail … 

maybe like three or four months later,” 
Jane said. “When I did tell them more 
of the details, they were like, ‘Oh, yeah, 
you have to watch out for him … he has 
the reputation for doing that.’”

Walker’s 
roommate 
confirmed 

the content of these rumors. She 
remembers hearing them while living 
near Muhammad during her freshman 
year.

GEO votes to strike in 
protest of fall reopening

Frustrated with administration’s plan for a hybrid semester, 
graduate students’ union plans for a major work stoppage

Bridge Scholars Program 
becomes increasingly white

Changing demographics alter the make-up of an initiative 
originally established to help Black students thrive at the ‘U’


Three 
weeks 
ago, 
LSA 

professor Bob King, the former 
president of the United Auto 
Workers, heard his phone buzz. 
When he picked it up, he saw an 
incoming call from his longtime 
friend Sen. Bernie Sanders, 
D-Vt., the liberal firebrand and 
former Democratic presidential 
candidate. 
Sanders 
asked 

if King would speak at the 
2020 
Democratic 
National 

Convention the upcoming week 
to nominate him for president. 
It was an offer King couldn’t 
pass up. 

“He personally called me,” 

said King, who teaches social 
theory and practice in the 
Residential College. “I told him 
I’d be honored to do it. I thought 
there might be some other 
people who would be better. 
But he said, ‘No, I’d like you to 
do it.’” 

Given their shared history 

fighting for workers’ rights, it 
made sense that Sanders picked 
King to nominate him at the 
convention. While nominating 
the 
senator, 
King 
praised 

Sanders, calling him a “great 
champion of the working class.”

King grew up in the Midwest, 

right in the middle of the nation’s 
automotive capital. But it wasn’t 
until college that King found 
himself 
working 
part-time 

summer jobs in auto factories 
in Metro Detroit. He strapped 
on steel-toed boots every day to 
head to work and got to know 
his 
blue-collar 
coworkers. 

Through conversations with his 
colleagues, King learned about 
the injustices faced by middle-
class workers and the need for 
strong labor unions to organize 
employees.

“A lot of the people I worked 

with 
didn’t 
have 
college 

educations or anything, but 
they were in many ways wiser, 
smarter than people who had 
a greater form of (education),” 
King said. “And then watching 
the struggles over the years, 
seeing what it took to really 
make change. It’s all played a 
role (in my life).” 

King completed two years 

of study at Holy Cross College 
in Indiana before transferring 
to the University of Michigan, 
where he earned his bachelor’s 
degree in political science. It 
was at Holy Cross, however, that 
King said he took classes that 
— like his conversations in the 
auto plant — helped to cement 
the core beliefs that guided him 
through his later work in the 
labor movement. 

“I took a French course by a 

Jesuit who really taught (me) … 

the way you have value in life 
is you raise human dignity and 
lessen human suffering,” King 
said. “And at the same time, I 
was taking a theology course 
from a person who believes in 
liberation theology and (in) 
the importance of caring about 
others. Life was about both 
kinds of ideas.”

Those experiences in the 

classroom and from his summer 
jobs stuck with King after 
graduation as he joined the 
workforce. In 1970, he took 

on a full-time job at Ford’s 
River Rouge Complex while 
completing a law degree at the 
University of Detroit Mercy. 
While working at the plant, 
he also joined a labor union 
— the United Auto Workers 
union Local 600 — and became 
president in 1984. 

King served two terms as 

president, chairing the UAW-
Ford Negotiating Committee 
during his second term. Both 
positions 
allowed 
him 
to 

organize and mobilize union 
workers in the area to fight for 
their rights. 

In 1989, King became director 

of Region 1A, an administrative 
unit of UAW encompassing 
several 
counties 
across 

Michigan. 
He 
served 
three 

terms in this role, which he said 
was one of the most rewarding 
experiences of his career. 

“In that whole time, it was 

always a core part of what I 
believed — getting members 
more involved and getting into 
it — demonstrations, rallies, 
striking for recognition (in) 
places that weren’t organized 
yet,” King said. 

Nine years after becoming 

the regional director, King was 
elected vice president of UAW. 
At the time, he was still heading 
their 
National 
Organizing 

Department, a position he had 
been appointed to the year 
prior. During his tenure as vice 
president, King helped to attract 
more than 60,000 new members 
in the first eight years. 

But when the Great Recession 

hit in 2008, the UAW lost more 
than 75,000 members as major 
auto companies like General 
Motors, Chrysler and Ford either 
went into or were threatened 
with bankruptcy and had to lay 
off thousands of workers. King 
said the experience tested his 
leadership.

“Everybody had to be part 

of the plan. It was a very 
collaborative effort which did 
say something,” King said. “… 
(But) if the members didn’t 

have a union, the company 
would have just unilaterally 
made 
changes 
(and) 
would 

not have had to step up and be 
transparent about what every 
stakeholder was doing.”

“The loudest part of the 

discussions and negotiations 
were 
getting 
commitments 

from the companies to agree 
that 
with 
the 
turnaround, 

massive 
investments 
would 

go into UAW facilities in the 
United States. We kept a lot of 
jobs in our country (and) saved 
communities,” King added.

After 
pushing 
through 

the 
financial 
crisis, 
King 

became UAW president. King’s 
predecessor, Ron Gettelfinger, 
told The New York Times in an 
interview he was thrilled to see 
King take over his position. 

“There is no question in 

my mind Bob King will be the 
right person to lead this union 
forward,” Gettelfinger said. “He 
is relentless and tenacious. Bob 
will move forward an agenda 
that will benefit all of our union, 
and he is a great negotiator.”

King described being UAW 

president as the capstone of his 
union career, helping build up 
the international network of 
workers from the Big Three and 
pushing for increased worker 
protections.

“The UAW members have a 

lot of courage, a lot of fight, so 
representing them was such an 
honor,” King said. 

After serving decades in the 

UAW, King decided to shift gears 

and inspire the next generation 
of the movement by becoming 
a lecturer at the University. 
He also took on leading roles 
in a number of organizations, 
including 
the 
Lecturer’s 

Employee Organization, One 
University Campaign and the 
student-led 
Climate 
Action 

Movement.

“I 
really 
appreciate 
and 

enjoy the classes I’ve done at 
the University of Michigan 
and continuing to do classes 
and 
workshops 
within 
the 

labor movement,” King said. 
“Getting the opportunity to sit 
down with students and/or sit 
down with workers and talk 
about important issues (and) 
have discussions where we’re 
all learning from each other — 
that’s really fantastic.”

King 
said 
he 
hopes 
his 

work helps further the labor 
movement.

“I hope that in working with 

students 
and 
working 
with 

unions in the area that we really 
do build up a movement that will 
demand and achieve a much, 
much more fairer society,” King 
said.

LSA senior Amytess Girgis 

spoke to The Daily about her 
experiences with King while 
working with him on both 
the One University Campaign 
and LEO. She said he stayed 
committed to cultivating an 
atmosphere where both students 
and school administrators felt 
heard and tried to push for 
change.

“Every time we go into these 

meetings (with administrators), 
we’re told that our ideas are 
great but it wouldn’t work 
because of X reason,” Girgis 
said. “And the fact that someone 
like Bob continues to come to 
the table and says, ‘No, this will 
work. You just need to rearrange 
your priorities and values in 
order to put your money where 
your mouth is.’ The fact that 
he’s continually able to do that 
really encourages us to be more 
confident in what we know is 
right.”

Whether speaking to millions 

of viewers across the nation, a 
room of labor union organizers 
or a classroom of two dozen 
people, King has dedicated his 
life to furthering the fight for 
workers’ rights. 

“In some ways, I’ve always 

been a movement builder,” King 
said. “I really fully understand 
that you never get change if 
you don’t build the grassroots 
movement that developed over a 
number of years.”

“I hope that in working with 

students and working with unions 
in the area that we really do build 
up a movement that will demand 

and achieve a much, much 

more fairer society.”


The strike will be time-limited 

and run until Friday, with the 
potential for reauthorization if 
the University does not meet the 
organization’s 
demands. 
GEO 

is asking for the diversion of 
funds from the Division of Public 
Safety and Security and more 
COVID-19 protections, such as 
the right to work remotely for 
all graduate student instructors, 
more transparency in opening 
plans and protection from hiring 
discrimination for those who 
wish to work remotely amid the 
pandemic.

GEO’s 
press 
release 
said 

policing 
and 
COVID-19 
are 

closely linked.

“We highlight that GEO views 

our anti-policing demands as 
inseparable from our COVID 
demands,” the release read. “They 
are linked explicitly, through the 
University’s decision to expand 
the policing of our community 
in a perverse effort to enforce 
social distancing, and implicitly, 
through the ways the crises of 
the pandemic and racist policing 
both disproportionately affect 
the most vulnerable among us.”

GEO has called for a “safe and 

just” response to the pandemic 
and held a “die-in” last week to 
protest the in-residence semester. 
Local leadership came to the 
decision to hold a strike vote amid 
concerns the University was not 
adequately responding to their 
demands. 

GEO 
Secretary 
Amir 

Fleischmann, a Rackham student, 
told The Daily the organization’s 
bargaining team felt continued 
negotiation would be futile.

“It’s 
the 
feeling 
of 
our 

bargaining team that there was 
not much more progress to be 
made at the bargaining table,” 
Fleischmann said. “And that’s 
why we feel it’s necessary to 
resort to these tactics. Because 
the University has shown that 
it’s not really been willing to 
compromise on a lot of these 
issues.”

GEO’s announcement comes 

on Labor Day, a federal holiday 
in honor of American workers. 
The strike follows the ratification 
of the union’s new three-year 
contract with the University in 
April.

In an email to The Daily, 

University 
spokesperson 
Rick 

Fitzgerald pointed out that GEO 
striking violates both the union’s 
contract and state law. 

“The 
state 
of 
Michigan 

prohibits public employees from 
striking,” 
Fitzgerald 
wrote. 

“GEO’s contract with U-M also 
prohibits the union and GSIs 
and GSSAs from taking part in 
any action or interference with 
the operations of the university, 
such as failing to report for duty 
or the failure to perform their 
employment duties.”

Fitzgerald said GEO had raised 

a variety of issues that “cannot 
be resolved as a matter of their 
contract or through a collective 
bargaining procedure.” He added 
that the University still intends 
to move forward with classes 
despite the strike.

GEO’s press release accused 

the University of failing to discuss 
their members’ concerns about 
policing in tandem with demands 
involving the school’s response to 
COVID-19.

“The University has again 

refused to bargain over these 
policing-related 
demands 
in 

our current impact bargaining 
negotiations, claiming that they 
are not relevant to University 
COVID-19 policies,” the release 
read. 
“GEO 
membership’s 

commitment to including anti-
policing demands in our current 
stoppage platform demonstrates 
how urgent and linked our 
membership’s priorities are. The 
university administration has run 
roughshod over the lives of the 
community’s most vulnerable.”

Some 
members 
of 
the 

University 
community 
have 

taken issue with the use of police 
officers 
to 
monitor 
student 

behavior for violations of social 
distancing guidelines as part of 
its Ambassador Program. Others 
worried the program didn’t have 
strong 
enough 
enforcement 

mechanisms. 

The University reversed course 

in response to the criticism. On 
Aug. 30, the University confirmed 
the program will no longer have 
sworn 
officers 
in 
patrolling 

teams. The teams still include 
unarmed members of the Division 
of Public Safety and Security.

“As always, police may be 

called to activities that present 
a safety risk or are in violation 
of the law, but the idea is for 
Michigan Ambassadors to first 
proactively provide outreach in 
the community to communicate 
and remind students about public 
health best practices,” University 
of Michigan President Mark 
Schlissel wrote in a Sept. 3 email 
to students.

Fleischmann 
said 
members 

are particularly frustrated by the 
University’s hesitance to address 
issues where it would not have to 
spend any additional money.

“And in particular, some of 

these things are issues that would 
not cost the University a dime to 
implement,” Fleischmann said. 
“In particular, like the changes 
to the childcare subsidies that 
we’re asking for, or demilitarizing 
DPSS, 
that’s 
not 
something 

that would come out of the 
University’s budget. So there’s not 
really a good reason we can see 
for why they would do this aside 
from obstinacy.”

associated 
with 

the American Federation for 
Teachers, which announced in 
July it will support “local and/
or state affiliate safety strikes 
on a case-by-case basis as a last 

resort.”

The 
Lecturers 
Employee 

Organization, 
a 
union 

representing non-tenure track 
faculty 
at 
the 
University, 

expressed 
support 
for 

GEO’s 
decision, 
claiming 

similar frustrations with the 
administration in a statement.

“Like our graduate student 

colleagues, 
LEO 
condemns 

the 
way 
the 
Administration 

has mismanaged the return to 
classes 
this 
Fall: 
employees, 

including Lecturers, were not 
properly consulted; information 
about the Fall plan, and internal 
disagreements over it, have been 
withheld; and the testing regime 
in place appears inadequate to 
the task of keeping students and 
employees safe,” the statement 
reads. “We stand in solidarity 
with GEO and all of the graduate 
student workers concerned for 
their lives and livelihoods, and 
encourage Lecturers to support 
their efforts.”

The University of Michigan’s 

chapter of the College Democrats 
also rallied behind GEO, issuing a 
statement in support of the union 
and encouraging their members 
to sign up for picket shifts.

“Unlike University ‘leaders,’ 

we are proud to stand behind 
GEO as they take the bold 
leadership required to protect 
the safety and well-being of our 
fellow students and the broader 
Washtenaw County community,” 
the statement read. 

Ryan Glauser, a member of 

GEO, took to Twitter on Saturday 
to express his frustration with 
the University for not meeting 
graduate students’ demands.

“... Grad students have asked 

for help for months!” Glauser 
wrote. “When we asked for 
emergency funding, we were 
denied. When we asked for pay 
raises that match (University) 
documentation 
on 
living 

standard, we were given an 
inflation rate increase.”

Glauser was not alone in using 

social media to promote the 
strike vote. Several GSIs spoke 
out in favor of the strike and 
encouraged their colleagues to 
participate.

Former 
GEO 
member 

Jean 
Hardy, 
previously 
a 

PhD candidate in the School 
of Information and now an 
assistant professor at Michigan 
State University, described the 
strike as a question of protecting 
the University community.

“My former union @UMich 

is voting on a strike in response 
to the university’s inability to 
protect its students, faculty, staff, 
and community members during 
the pandemic,” Hardy wrote on 
Twitter. “As an alum (because 
I can say that now), the way the 
university is handling this crisis 
is deplorable.”

STRIKE

“I’ve had quite a few people 

(come to me) about something he 
has done,” Walker’s roommate 
said. “And they always asked me 
to keep it confidential, which is 
why I never spoke up.”

Two 
others 
accused 

Muhammad of stalking them in 
their residence halls. A year after 
the alleged incident with Jane, 
Muhammad was living in West 
Quad in an all-male hall adjacent 
to a mixed-gender hall.

In January 2019, Muhammad 

allegedly harassed two female 
West 
Quad 
residents 
living 

near his room, according to a 
report 
filed 
with 
residential 

staff. Though the specifics of 
this alleged harassment remain 
unclear, it was characterized to 
the University as “stalking.”

One person with knowledge of 

this incident spoke to The Daily, 
corroborating the nature of the 
alleged harassment. The Daily 
was also able to verify the content 
of the report.

Muhammad 
continued 
to 

live near these residents for the 
remainder of the year. The Daily 
could not determine what steps, 
if any, the University took to 
investigate this complaint. 

In November 2019, Muhammad 

announced 
he 
was 
entering 

the transfer portal to leave the 
University ten months after the 
report was filed. Though he was 
reported to have transferred 
to the University of Houston, 
a 
spokesperson 
for 
Houston 

confirmed that he never enrolled 
there. 

Instead, 
he 
transferred to 

Kilgore Community College in 
Texas. It is unclear if his initial 
transfer, or his detachment from 
Houston, is related to this report.

Jimmy Rieves, the athletic 

director at Kilgore Community 
College, 
confirmed 
that 

Muhammad 
was 
enrolled 
at 

the school this past spring and 
summer.

“We didn’t have any knowledge 

of the allegations,” Rieves wrote 
in an email to The Daily. “He 
was referred to us by another 4 
year school that had recruited 
him and they didn’t have enough 
scholarship money for him to 
attend their institution.”

However, 
Rieves 
noted 

Muhammad would no longer be 
enrolled as of this fall.

“He is not going to be enrolled 

here this Fall, not because of any 
disciplinary 
reasons,” 
Rieves 

wrote.

It 
is 
also 
unclear 
if 

Muhammad’s decision to transfer 
from the University was based 
on this report of alleged sexual 
harassment. 

In an email to The Daily, 

University 
spokesman 
Rick 

Fitzgerald explained that the 
University is prohibited by both 
federal law and University policy 
from confirming or discussing 
allegations of sexual misconduct 
against students.

Fitzgerald said “all student 

matters 
are 
handled” 
in 

accordance with the University’s 
policy on student sexual and 
gender-based misconduct.

“Similarly, all allegations of 

sexual 
misconduct 
reported 

to Athletics, Housing or any 
individual or unit at the University 
with reporting obligations would 
be referred to the Office for 
Institutional Equity for review,” 
Fitzgerald added.

Football spokesperson David 

Ablauf and athletic department 
spokesperson Kurt Svoboda both 
forwarded The Daily’s questions 
to Fitzgerald.

“We can tell you that all student 

matters are handled in the same 
manner. There is no difference in 
the process for student athletes 
or any other subset of the student 
body,” Fitzgerald wrote. 

Fitzgerald 
stressed 
the 

importance 
of 
reporting 

allegations of sexual harassment 
or misconduct to the University.

“I 
also 
would 
emphasize 

how important it is that sexual 
misconduct be reported to the 
University and to OIE,” Fitzgerald 
said. “We want everyone to report 
any activity they believe may be a 
violation of our policies so those 
actions can be evaluated and 
addressed appropriately.”

The 
football 
program 
has 

worked to increase awareness 
of 
the 
systemic 
problem 
of 

sexual misconduct on college 
campuses and in college athletics, 
specifically.

Shortly 
after 
the 
alleged 

incident with Walker in summer 
2018, Brenda Tracy, sexual assault 
survivor and activist, came to 
the University to speak to the 
football team. Photographs from 
that night show Muhammad was 
present for Tracy’s talk.

In 1998, two members of the 

Oregon State University football 
team raped Tracy. She now talks 
to athletic programs, fraternities 
and other organizations about 
ending the culture of sexual 
violence in collegiate and athletic 
settings.

At the time, her speech to the 

football team in September 2018 
drew praise from football coach 
Jim Harbaugh.

“It was an amazing experience,” 

Harbaugh said on his Attack 
Each Day podcast. “She shared 
her story with our team and was 
very powerful. Her courage is at 
a level it’s hard to even imagine. 
A remarkable story which she’s 
been able to overcome. So many 
things came out of that meeting.”

In a recent interview with 

The Daily, Tracy explained that 
though she felt her conversations 
with the football players were 
productive, she was not surprised 
by the allegations against a former 
member of the team.

“It was a good visit,” Tracy 

said. “And you hope that these 
things don’t happen. But they do, 
unfortunately. And that’s probably 
one of the most frustrating things 
about the work I do … No matter 
how hard I work, someone is 
going to be hurt.”

Tracy ends every talk with a 

call to action, including asking 
her audience to sign her “Set the 
Expectation” pledge. For men’s 
teams, the pledge includes a 
commitment not to engage in 
“harmful behavior such as rape, 
sexual assault, physical violence, 
domestic/dating 
violence, 

stalking, bullying, hazing and 

taking or sharing photos and 
videos of a sexually explicit/
violent nature,” with a penalty of 
dismissal from the team.

The Michigan football team 

did not sign Tracy’s pledge at the 
end of her visit. She explained that 
while she speaks at many football 
programs, few agree to sign.

“It’s interesting that some 

coaches sign and some coaches 
don’t have their players sign,” 
Tracy said. “And I think that 
different coaches are in different 
places of accountability, what 
they’re willing to do and not 
willing to do. And so I’m not 
making a formal statement about 
anybody, but there is a certain 
level of commitment that comes 
with making your players sign 
the pledge. Because once you’ve 
signed it, then we can expect 
accountability.”

The Michigan football team 

invited Tracy back to speak in 
2019, but still has not signed her 
pledge.

“I hope that someday coach 

Harbaugh will have his players 
sign,” Tracy said. “That’s my 
hope. But I can’t make him do it. 
But hopefully, someday we get to 
that point where he’s ready to do 
that.”

Given 
Muhammad’s 
status 

as a football player, Tracy said 
she understood why two alleged 
survivors 
declined 
to 
report 

allegations of sexual misconduct 
to the University.

“This culture of survivors being 

afraid to come forward against 
football players is something we 
really have to work on,” Tracy 
said. “That doesn’t surprise me 

… that you had survivors who are 
afraid to come forward against 
really high profile athletes.”

Walker’s roommate expressed 

concern at what she described as 
Muhammad’s belief that being 
a football player entitled him to 
sex. 

“I remember her telling me 

that he had said to her that … he 
didn’t think that she could come 
into a football player’s room and 
not do something,” Walker’s 
roommate said. 

Jane recalled speaking with 

friends on other athletic teams 
about 
Muhammad. 
She 
was 

shocked at their knowledge of 
rumors 
about 
Muhammad’s 

alleged behavior.

“They said, ‘Oh, yes, he has a 

reputation,’” Jane remembered 
her friends saying. “All the girls 
in the athletic field try to avoid 
him.”

Walker said she wishes she had 

acted on her allegations sooner.

“Now that I know there’s been 

other girls, I really regret not 
coming forward when I should 
have,” Walker said. “I didn’t 
want to go through reporting and 
answering questions and doing 
all this and that. But now that 
it’s been a good amount of time ... 
and I’m hearing about these other 
girls that have been affected, 
I’m absolutely willing to come 
forward with them.”

ALLEGATIONS

The programs were initially 

created 
“to 
give 
students—

primarily 
in-state 
minority 

students from inner-city high 
schools—an 
opportunity 
to 

attend the University of Michigan 
during the summer to achieve 
a solid academic foundation for 
success in the fall term.”

State law prohibits colleges 

from taking race into account 
in 
the 
admissions 
process. 

Michigan 
voters 
approved 

Proposal 2 in 2006, which 
prevents state entities, including 
the 
University, 
from 
giving 

individuals 
“preferential 

treatment” based on their “race, 
sex, color, ethnicity, or national 
origin.” 
The 
United 
States 

Sixth Court of Appeals later 
overturned the proposal, but in 
April 2014, the appeal’s court 
ruling was reversed and the U.S. 
Supreme Court determined the 
law was constitutional.

Though the University was 

prohibited from considering race 
and ethnicity when accepting 
students into CSP following 
the Supreme Court’s decision 
to uphold the proposal, Black 
students still made up the largest 
proportion of Bridge students. 
But for unclear reasons, in 
2018, the demographics shifted, 
marking the first year white 
students made up the largest 
racial group in the program. 

As 
the 
program 
becomes 

increasingly white, some are 
calling out the demographic shift 
on social media. In a post on @
blackatmichigan, an Instagram 
page that posts submissions from 
Black students, alumni, faculty 
and staff at the University, “a fed 
up Bridge kid” said they were 
angered by the falling percentage 
of Black students in Bridge.

Changing Demographics in 

the Comprehensive Studies 
Program

The University’s Office of 

Undergraduate 
Admissions 

places selected applicants into 
one of two CSP programs over 
the summer: the CSP Summer 
Program or the Summer Bridge 
Scholars 
Program. 
The 
two 

programs 
have 
moderately 

different 
requirements, 
but 

“the intent behind both is the 
same,” according to Trotter. 
In 2020, there were 310 people 
total between the two programs, 
according to the University’s 
Office of Public Affairs.

According to Public Affairs, 

Bridge was composed of 47.4 
percent 
African 
American 

students 
and 
18.7 
percent 

white students in 2016. Those 
demographics changed to 21.6 
percent African American and 
39.8 percent white in 2019. White 
students made up the largest 
racial group in Bridge that year. 

CSP combined Bridge and CSP 

Summer in 2020 due to COVID-

19, Trotter said. This summer in 
the combined programs, Black 
students made up 27.3 percent 
of students and white students 
made up 36.7 percent, once 
again making white students the 
largest racial group in CSP.

According to Trotter, first-

time, first-year students and 
transfer students are eligible to 
be admitted into the program. 
Students told The Daily the 
University said the program 
was mandatory in order for 
them to attend the school in the 
fall. If students are not initially 
admitted into the program by 
OUA, they can also apply for CSP 
affiliation later on, according to 
Trotter.

Erica Sanders, director of 

undergraduate admissions, said 
her office does not consider race 
and gender in the application 
review process for CSP, in 
compliance with Michigan state 
law.

According to Sanders, the 

department looks at the entirety 
of a student’s application and 
considers many aspects of their 
background to determine if they 
should be in CSP.

“Information shared in the 

student’s application materials 
indicated the program would 
provide a positive impact on her 
transition to the University of 
Michigan campus community,” 
Sanders said.

Art 
& 
Design 
sophomore 

Nicholos 
Daniel, 
who 

participated in CSP Summer in 
2019, said the University must 
begin changing whom it accepts 
into the program. 

“They 
need 
to 
reevaluate 

who gets admitted to the Bridge 
program and who doesn’t get 
admitted,” Daniel said. “This 
program is made for minority 
Black students. So to see majority 
white students attending the 
programs 
made 
for 
Black 

students, that’s an issue within 
itself that needs to be addressed.”

Some Black students said 

they felt less comfortable in the 
program as the number of white 
students has overtaken that of 
Black students. Womack said 
she found herself changing her 
behaviors because she was afraid 
of being judged by her white 
peers.

“Even just picking out what 

you eat, you don’t want to relate 
to any stereotypes,” Womack 
said. “That’s something that I 
shouldn’t have had to do, but 
it’s definitely something that’s 
always on my mind. Just noticing 
who’s around me, what they 
might be thinking, definitely 
because of my race and just how I 
wore my hair, just lots of things.”

Inside the Bridge and CSP 

Summer Experience

Many Black students said they 

felt CSP benefitted them both 
academically and socially. Daniel 
said Bridge gave him the tools he 
needed to feel prepared for the 
University.

“For me, it definitely was 

beneficial, just because I am a 
very energetic, outgoing person 
and it definitely did help me get 
used to college,” Daniel said. “It 
helped me in terms of adjusting 
and getting to know the do’s and 
don’ts and where to go for certain 
resources and stuff.”

Other Black students required 

to participate in the program did 
not find it as helpful. LSA junior 
Rochelle Sims, who was in the 
CSP Summer Program in 2018, 
said she did not understand why 
the Office of Undergraduate 
Admissions placed her into CSP 
because she felt like her high 
school prepared her for the 
University. 

“I feel like they want Bridge to 

help you transition into college 
life, and I didn’t think I needed 
that,” Sims said. “In the fall, 
I didn’t use CSP programs or 
anything like that, and I did fine, 
I aced my classes and everything 
… I just felt like it just got me 
familiar to the campus and 
some of the resources that the 
University had to offer.”

Rackham 
student 
Michole 

Washington, a former CSP math 
instructor, said while programs 
like CSP Summer and Bridge 
can be beneficial in helping some 
students of color transition to 
college, the University should not 
assume that because a student 
is a minority, they automatically 
need 
additional 
academic 

support.

“In my research right now 

I’ve been wondering … what 
is happening in these Bridge 
programs when you’re saying, 
‘Oh, this is for Black students,’ 
and you’re just assuming that all 
Black students are at the same 
academic ability?” Washington 
asked.

Many 
Black 
students, 

regardless of their background, 
agreed that the program should 
increase the number of Black 
faculty members teaching the 
courses. Five students told The 
Daily they had either one or no 
Black instructors during their 
program.

According 
to 
Trotter, 
in 

summer 2020, 25 percent of the 
Bridge faculty identified as Black.

Daniel said he and many 

of his Black peers had trouble 
relating to the way one of his 
white instructors spoke about 
transitioning to the University.

“They were talking about 

… adjusting to college as if I 
came from this home where 
I had a mom and a dad in the 
house where we had decent 
income,” Daniel said. “Like it 
was plenty of people who kind 
of felt uncomfortable because 
they did not fit the criteria that 
(the teacher) was talking about 
when it came to adjusting to 
college.”

Gyms 
and 
pools 
can 

reopen subject to restrictions 
to 
uphold 
public 
health 

protocols amid the COVID-
19 pandemic, Gov. Gretchen 
Whitmer 
announced 

Thursday. Some organized 
sports will also be permitted 
to resume as part of the state’s 
gradual reopening process.

Following the governor’s 

executive 
order, 
the 

University 
of 
Michigan’s 

Department of Recreational 
Sports announced plans to 
begin reopening its facilities 
to the campus community in 
the next several weeks.

The 
department 
noted 

that the process would not 
take 
place 
immediately, 

nor 
without 
the 
proper 

health and safety measures 
recommended by state and 
federal officials.

“The exact reopening dates 

for each facility will not be 
determined until we evaluate 
the amount of work still 
needed,” the update read. “We 
will then develop timelines 
for how quickly this work can 
be completed and ensure we 
can meet all additional state 
requirements.”

In 
the 
press 
release, 

Whitmer explained that her 
order is in accordance with 
the public-health informed 
policies her office has tried to 
pursue during the pandemic.

“Throughout 
this 

pandemic, we have followed 
the best science and data 
available to make decisions 
that will keep Michiganders 
safe, and our hard work is 
paying off,” Whitmer said. 
“Today we are announcing 
the reopening of gyms and 
pools 
with 
strict 
safety 

measures in place to protect 
patrons and their families.”

In an interview with The 

Daily, Mike Widen, director 
of recreational sports at the 
University, 
said 
the 
plan 

will be rolled out in phases 
and with students’ health in 
mind.

“We put together a phased 

reopening 
plan 
that 
will 

include some reduced hours 
when 
we 
open,” 
Widen 

said. “We wanted to reduce 
the hours a little bit so we 
get a chance to really get 
some extra cleaning done 
in between times. Luckily 
we have three facilities in 
order to make that happen. 
So we’re gonna look at less 
hours per day for each facility 
but we’ll try to make sure that 
each facility, we get the most 
utilization time.”

In addition to frequent 

cleaning 
and 
spaced 
out 

exercise equipment, Widen 
said that intramural sports 
would occur in a safe manner, 
only 
with 
activities 
that 

allow for a greater degree of 
social distancing than the 
intramural sports students 
usually play

“The 
intramural 
sports 

program is starting this fall 
with outdoor and virtual 
programs only,” Widen said. 
“So the outdoor programs 
will be those that we can 
physically 
distance, 
so 

we’re doing things like (for) 
basketball 
we’re 
playing 

HORSE 
instead 
of 
five-

on-five 
or 
three-on-three. 

We’re 
playing 
beanbags, 

we’re playing Kan Jam, we’re 
playing 
Pickleball, 
we’re 

playing singles tennis.”

The 
Department 
of 

Recreational 
Sports 

anticipates needing time to 
fully reopen gyms in order 
to “complete the necessary 
hiring, training, maintenance 
and safety precautions to 
prepare 
our 
facilities 
to 

safely operate in a COVID-
19 public health informed 
environment.”

The Michigan Republican 

Party 
announced 
Sarah 

Hubbard and Carl Meyers as its 
candidates for the University 
of Michigan Board of Regents 
this weekend. They will face 
off against incumbents Shauna 
Ryder Diggs (D) and Mark 
Bernstein (D) in the November 
general 
election. 
Currently, 

Regent Ron Weiser is the only 
Republican 
serving 
on 
the 

board. 

Meyers, a longtime political 

operative and former Michigan 
Republican 
Party 
treasurer, 

ran unsuccessfully for regent 
in 2004 and 2016. He also made 
a bid for the position in 2014 
but did not receive enough 
votes at the state nominating 
convention. Meyers, a U-M 
Dearborn alum, is currently 
the senior vice president of 
Investments 
at 
Raymond 

James.

Meyers 
thanked 
the 

Republican 
Party 
for 
the 

nomination in a Facebook post 
and said if elected, he wants to 
freeze tuition at the University.

 “After all athletes are back 

on the field and students back 
in the classroom, my first order 
of business will be to propose 
a freeze in tuition,” Meyers 
wrote. “Yes, freeze tuition … 
U of M is now one of the most 
expensive public universities 
in the country. In the middle 
of the COVID-19 pandemic, 
the Board chose to raise tuition 
costs … this is just wrong.” 

In 2016, his platform focused 

on fiscal conservatism, budget 
transparency and accessibility. 
His priorities for 2020 are 
similar, noting the need for 
financial discipline in response 
to the COVID-19 pandemic.

According 
to 
Meyers’s 

pre-convention 
campaign 

statement, Meyers’s campaign 
has raised a total of $179.68 
in contributions and other 
receipts, all of which came 
from Meyers himself.

Meyers 
did 
not 
respond 

immediately to request for 
comment.

Hubbard, his co-challenger 

and University alum, is a 
small-business 
owner 
and 

has experience working in 
Republican politics. According 
to her campaign website, she 
will try to lower tuition by 
taking efforts to “rein in out of 
control spending.” 

The 
website 
also 
notes 

that she wants the University 
to 
reopen 
for 
in-person 

classes amid the pandemic 
and emphasizes the need to 
promote freedom of speech 
on 
campus, 
claiming 
that 

conservative 
voices 
are 

“consistently 
mocked 
and 

stymied, even to the point of 
being banned” on campus. 

In an interview with The 

Daily, 
Hubbard 
said 
her 

Republican values informed 
her campaign for regent.

“I’m conservative, pro-life, 

pro-Second 
Amendment 
— 

that’s something that just as a 
regent I think is important and 
a matter of representing the 
Republican Party,” Hubbard 
said. “But as far as issues 
before the Board of Regents, I 
haven’t really had a chance to 
look at those and how it applies 
at this point.”

Hubbard expressed support 

for the University’s decision 
to bring students back to 
campus for a hybrid semester, 
a decision that has sparked 
criticism from both students 
and faculty.

“It’s important that students 

be back at school and I admire 
the fact that the University 
has found a way to bring kids 
back to the dorms,” Hubbard 
said. “I also wish that we could 
move forward with a football 
season, just like a lot of our 
peers are across the country. 
Unfortunately, the Big Ten 
made this decision to basically 
cancel football … and it’s too 
bad because it plays such an 
important role for the entire 
athletic system at Michigan 
as well as the University as a 
whole.”

The Big Ten has not canceled 

the season entirely. Instead, 
the 
season 
is 
tentatively 

postponed, 
though 
the 

organization has not said how 
long this postponement will be.

According 
to 
campaign 

finance documents filed prior 
to the convention, Hubbard’s 
campaign has raised a total 

of $2,675 in contributions and 
other receipts. Of that, $1,000 
came from her father, Jerry 
Hubbard, 
who 
previously 

served as a supervisor of 
Branch County Commissioner 
and Union Township.

In addition to advocating 

for Second Amendment rights, 
Hubbard’s campaign website 
lists supporting anti-abortion 
voices on campus as a priority, 
a stance she doubled down on 
when speaking to The Daily.

“I think it’s important for 

all voices, really, to be brought 
to 
the 
fore(front) 
related 

to discussions on campus,” 
Hubbard said. “It’s important 
to 
make 
sure 
everyone’s 

heard pro-life conservatives 
in classrooms, and that they 
are able to make sure that 
their points are made and that 
they’re understood, that there 
are several points of view on 
lots of different issues and we 
want to make sure that that 
kind of speech is protected.”

In 
a 
June 
2 
Facebook 

post detailing his campaign 
priorities, 
Meyers 
also 

highlighted what he sees as the 
stifling of conservative voices 
on campus.

“From 
the 
Governor’s 

office to our universities, civil 
liberties are being eroded. 
I believe in protecting free 
speech on campus and assuring 
fair admissions for all,” Meyers 
wrote. “The University must 
foster 
an 
environment 
on 

campus where all students feel 
free and safe to express their 
thoughts and views, without 
fear 
of 
retribution 
from 

fellow students, faculty or the 
administration.” 

Meyers also acknowledged 

the 
difficulty 
of 
running 

against 
incumbents, 

arguing that the Democratic 
supermajority on the Board of 
Regents must go.

 “This is going to be a tough 

race…,” 
Meyers 
wrote. 
“I 

expect to be running against 
two sitting liberal Democratic 
incumbents. It’s going to be 
a real fight, but I’m up to the 
challenge!”

The 
University 
of 

Michigan’s football rivalry 
with Ohio State University’s 
spans more than a century. 
This year, the two teams will 
not have the opportunity to 
play after Big Ten presidents 
and chancellors, including 
University President Mark 
Schlissel, announced that the 
season would be postponed 
with hopes of assembling a 
spring schedule. 

Baltimore Ravens coach 

John Harbaugh, brother of 
Michigan football coach Jim 
Harbaugh, has continued to 
advocate for a football season, 
telling reporters Wednesday, 
“Free the Big Ten. Let’s go. 
Let’s go play some football.” 
Jim Harbaugh has loudly 
advocated 
for 
playing 

football this fall, releasing a 
lengthy statement citing his 
team’s low positive test rate 
last month.

On Saturday, Jim Harbaugh 

attended a protest organized 
by Michigan football parents 
calling for a fall football 
season.

“Free the Big Ten, like 

my brother John Harbaugh 
said,” 
Jim 
Harbaugh 

told reporters. “I mean, 
(it) says it all. We want 
to be free to play.”

Schlissel was one of 

the Big Ten presidents 
who 
voted 
in 
favor 

of putting off the fall 
season. In an August 
statement, 
Schlissel 

noted there were “too 
many poorly understood 
health 
and 
safety 

concerns 
unique 
to 

intercollegiate athletics 
to 
move 
forward 

with 
practices 
and 

competition at present.”

On 
Saturday, 
Jim 

Harbaugh 
said 
he 

“would have rather been 
coming to a game than a 
rally,” adding that “We 
should’ve 
been 
playing 
a 

game today.”

While 
the 
Harbaughs 

criticize the Big Ten, local 
politicians 
and 
university 

chapters 
of 
College 

Democrats in both Michigan 
and 
Ohio 
are 
shifting 

the blame to the Trump 
administration.

In 
a 
virtual 
press 

conference Friday morning, 
U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell, 
D-Mich., 
Columbus 
City 

Attorney Zach Klein and 
students from universities 
across Michigan and Ohio 
criticized 
the 
Trump 

administration’s 
pandemic 

response 
while 
endorsing 

former 
Vice 
President 

Joe 
Biden’s 
policies 
and 

campaign. 

Trump 
has 
been 
in 

contact 
with 
Big 
Ten 

Commissioner Kevin Warren 
recently, 
discussing 
how 

the conference can resume 
playing as soon as possible. 
On Tuesday, Trump tweeted 
that discussions put them on 
“the one yard line.”

At the press conference 

Friday, Dingell described her 
love for Michigan football 
and her disappointment in 
the canceled season.

“There’s 
nothing 
better 

on a Saturday than a Big 
Ten football game,” Dingell 
said. “Quite frankly, I like 
football more than I like 
politics and suddenly we 
don’t have a season this fall 
... the way that COVID has 
been handled from the very 
beginning 
is 
determining 

what’s happening in this 
country.”

Dingell said she wears 

a 
mask 
and 
practices 

physical distancing to lead 
by 
example. 
Trump 
has 

wavered 
on 
supporting 

COVID-19 precautions such 
as masks and distancing. 
Most recently, the majority 
of attendees did not practice 
these safety precautions at 
the 
Republican 
National 

Convention.

She 
acknowledged 
the 

frustration of both players 
and 
fans 
and 
addressed 

the economic strain these 
decisions put on towns like 
Ann Arbor. 

“Our college athletes are 

upset,” Dingell said. “Do 
you know what this does to a 
town like Ann Arbor and the 
surrounding 
communities 

or any of the other Big 
Ten hometowns? It hurts 
those small businesses and 
there’s no question — what 
we don’t need is a president 
playing politics with a very 
flammable situation.”

Klein, an alum of Ohio 

State 
University, 
said 
he 

was disappointed about the 
cancellation of the fall season 
but celebrated the two states 

coming together to discuss 
COVID-19 policies and the 
importance 
of 
economic 

recovery. 

“The greatest rivalry in 

college sports: Ohio State 
versus Michigan in football,” 
Klein said. “The fact that 
we’re coming together to 
talk about the importance 
of COVID, recovery, sports, 
the economy, our health I 
think is really summed up in 
the cancellation of a football 
season.”

Klein said college sports 

have 
a 
massive 
impact 

not 
only 
on 
universities 

themselves 
but 
on 
their 

surrounding communities as 
well.

“Our economy is failing 

and we have no football,” 
Klein said. “All of that is 
because of failed presidential 
leadership. 
The 
economy 

is COVID and COVID is 
the economy and until the 
president of the United States 
recognizes it for what it’s 
worth and takes it seriously 
... not only are we not going 
to have football, we’re not 
going to have the economic 
rebound for the families that 
deserve it.”

Ben 
Schuster, 

Business 
senior 

at 
the 
University 

of 
Michigan 
and 

presidential campaign 
organizing director for 
Ohio students, spoke 
about Trump’s slow 
pandemic 
response, 

saying Trump failed 
to heed warnings from 
scientists 
about 
the 

impact of the virus.

“Donald Trump did 

not take the steps that 
we need(ed) to control 
this 
pandemic,” 

Schuster said. “He’s 
had 
six 
months 
to 

come up with a plan 
but 
instead 
he’s 

ignored 
warnings, 

downplayed the threat 

COVID-19 poses and attacked 
social distancing measures 
that would have slowed the 
spread.”

Schuster 
said 
he 
is 

disappointed by the lack of 
action from Trump on policy 
issues pertaining to COVID-
19. 

“I take this rivalry very 

seriously and Trump always 
says he’s doing something to 
get football back but he isn’t,” 
Schuster said. “Like always, 
he is tweeting demands with 
no follow-through.”

Multiple residence halls confirm cases of COVID-19

Multiple residents across three 

University of Michigan residence 
halls tested positive for COVID-
19 less than a week into the fall 
semester.

One resident of South Quad 

Residence Hall, two residents 
of Bursley Residence Hall and 
one 
resident 
of 
North 
Quad 

Residence Hall tested positive 
for the virus over the weekend, 
according to notices from Danielle 
Sheen, executive director of the 
Environment, Health & Safety 
Department, obtained by The 
Michigan Daily.

All four students were relocated 

from their respective residence 
halls after receiving their results, 
and spaces where they were present 
have been disinfected.

University spokesperson Rick 

Fitzgerald confirmed all four cases 
in an email to The Daily. He said the 
notifications to residents and staff 
of affected dorms are part of the 
University’s efforts to be proactive 
in 
informing 
the 
community 

about the presence of the virus on 
campus.

“Public 
health 
community 

notification 
is 
designed 
to 

proactively 
make 
the 
U-M 

community aware of positive cases 
on campus,” Fitzgerald wrote. “We 
are following our normal protocol 
for sharing publicly about potential 
exposures to infectious diseases, 
like COVID-19, mumps, norovirus.”

Also according to protocol, 

Fitzgerald said residents and staff 
“identified as close contacts” of the 
four residents who tested positive 
were contacted separately by the 
Environment, Health & Safety 
Department and that those who 
did not receive a follow-up are 
considered at low risk of having 
been exposed. 

Fitzgerald 
did 
not 
confirm 

whether 
these 
four 
residents 

have been relocated to University 
Quarantine & Isolation Housing, 
which the University’s COVID-
19 dashboard shows to be at 5.8% 
occupancy currently with nine 
positive COVID-19 cases and 26 
who were either exposed or await 
test results.

The list of positive cases in 

University Housing continues to 
grow with these four, after two 
cases were reported in West Quad 
Residence Hall during move-in 
week. The COVID-19 dashboard 
reflects an even greater total of 
26 positive cases among students 
within the past 14 days.

These additional cases are being 

reported less than two weeks after 
the majority of incoming residents 
moved into University residence 
halls. While University Housing 
made 
modifications 
to 
their 

move-in procedures to minimize 
exposure and crowding, several 
students told The Daily these 
precautions — such as limiting 
students to one guest to help them 
move and requiring masks in 
common areas — went unenforced. 

Residential staff voiced concerns 

prior to move-in and demanded 
increased protections for both 
themselves and their residents, 
such as an increase in testing, more 
personal protective equipment and 
bathroom sanitation to occur three 
times a day. Regarding the latter, 
Fitzgerald wrote that bathrooms in 

residence halls are “sanitized twice 
a day using EPA-regulated agents.”

The University is also a week into 

its hybrid semester, with 31 percent 
of undergraduate classes featuring 
in-person or hybrid instructions. 
The partially in-person mode of 
instruction has drawn criticism 
as well from faculty in particular. 

The Faculty Senate will meet next 
Wednesday to consider a vote of 
no confidence in the University 
administration regarding its fall 
reopening.

Any member of the campus 

community with symptoms should 
contact University Health Service 
at 734-764-8320 for a free COVID-

19 test and isolate themselves. 
Those with mild symptoms can 
also use the University’s Online 
Assessment system to begin the 
testing process.

When Nick Gaspar saw an article 

about the Chinese government’s 
rush to build a new Wuhan, China 
hospital in February, the University 
of Michigan-Flint distance learning 
director started silently working on 
a new website in February.

Gaspar, an adjunct lecturer 

in nursing, didn’t think the page 
would ever be used, but in case 
the University suddenly moved to 
remote learning, he wanted faculty 
members to have a resource guide 
on what to do. He built what is now 
the Academic Continuity page on 
the U-M Flint website. 

The first item on the Academic 

Continuity page is a video Gaspar 
didn’t think anyone would see. 
A month later, Gaspar stood in 
a faculty meeting as everyone 
watched it.

“Hello, 
I’m 
Nick 
Gaspar, 

director of the Office of Extended 
Learning,” he says in the video. “If 
you are watching this, then there is 
likely an emergency preventing you 
from teaching on campus.”

Gaspar described the week 

of March 9 as exciting rather 
than troublesome. Because the 
University’s Flint and Dearborn 
campuses have regularly offered 
online courses each semester, many 
faculty members have previous 
experience teaching online. Both 
campuses also had centralized 
departments responsible for online 
instruction 
assistance 
before 

remote teaching became universal, 
which faculty said helped ease the 
transition.

Jill Darling, a lecturer at the 

College of Arts, Sciences and 
Letters on the Dearborn campus, 
has been teaching online for nearly 
four years. Usually, she teaches one 
online section and three in-person 
sections of a writing course.

“I was pretty comfortable with 

it, but also teaching online is so 
different than teaching in person,” 
Darling said. “It’s like you have to 
continually learn and improve the 
class every time.”

This year, Darling gained access 

to Zoom to connect with students 
in 
her 
asynchronous 
classes. 

Rather 
than 
technical 
issues 

or online experience, Darling’s 
primary concern during the remote 
transition in the winter semester 
was her students’ well-being. 

Similarly, 
for 
Stevens 

Wandmacher, 
a 
philosophy 

lecturer on the Flint campus, the 
only difference this semester is 
teaching 
synchronously 
with 

Zoom. Wandmacher had been 

teaching at least one online course 
each semester before COVID-19. 
He once had a former student take 
another course with him online 
because it fit the student’s schedule 
better.

“We had all that, a well-

established staff dedicated to those 
sorts of things for when COVID 
started, and people who had never 
taught online had to switch,” 
Wandmacher said. “We had people 
that were prepared to help them 
with experience and whatnot, and 
I think that helped us a lot in Flint.”

This pivot felt more rigid for 

instructors on the Ann Arbor 
campus, 
according 
to 
Kirsten 

Herold, a lecturer at the School of 
Public Health who serves as the 
Lecturers’ Employee Organization 
vice president. 

Herold, whose union represents 

lecturers on all three campuses, 
said 
transitioning 
to 
online 

instruction has been particularly 
difficult for Ann Arbor faculty 
members, who have less experience 
with online teaching than faculty 
on the other campuses. 

“I think the main difference 

really was that Ann Arbor until 
this point had not really embraced 
online education,” Herold said. 

Looking back at the winter 

term, when faculty had five days to 
convert classes to online formats, 
Cindee Giffen, a Biology lecturer on 
the Ann Arbor campus, views that 
time as crisis management. 

When preparing to teach this 

semester, Giffen didn’t anticipate 
certain challenges — for example, 
the large time commitment needed 
to build an accessible online course. 
She spent nine weeks converting 
her Biology 171 course to a digital 
format over the summer. 

“I would say that what we were 

doing in March was emergency 
online teaching, it was not really 
possible for us to use good online 
pedagogy at that point,” Giffen said. 
“And so it was anxiety-inducing, it 
was difficult. It was learning a ton 
of new things all at once.”

Giffen and her co-instructor 

recorded lectures, rewrote exams, 
edited old recordings, modified 
course content and added COVID-
related material, split videos into 
smaller clips and wrote guiding 
questions to keep students focused 
during videos in preparation for 
fall semester, which she didn’t have 
time to do in March.

The 
Michigan 
Daily 

anonymously 
surveyed 
nearly 

1,800 incoming University of 
Michigan freshmen to gauge 
their 
feelings 
on 
everything 

from schoolwork to social life as 
they begin college amid a global 
pandemic and period of social 
unrest. 

The unprecedented nature of 

2020 is not the only thing that 
sets the incoming class apart. 
The University aimed to enroll 
approximately 7,200 students for 
the freshman class this fall, a 20 
percent increase from the target 
class size six years ago. 

Out 
of 
the 
65,899 
total 

applicants 
for 
fall 
2020, 

17,054 
were 
admitted 
and 

7,188 matriculated as of July 
26, according to the Office of 
Undergraduate 
Admissions 

student profile. The University 
admitted 25.88 percent of its 
applicants, compared to the 23 
percent acceptance rate for the 
fall 2018 applicants reported by 
U.S. News & World Report. 

The fall 2020 incoming class 

earned a median high school GPA 
of 3.90, with a middle 50 percent 
range of 1380 to 1550 for the SAT 
and 32 to 35 for the ACT.

University 
spokesman 
Rick 

Fitzgerald wrote in an email 
to The Daily that as of Aug. 19, 
69 percent of undergraduate 

classes will be taught remotely, 
and 31 percent will be taught in 
an in-person or hybrid format, 
not including independent study 
courses.

The 
following 
data 
was 

collected from a survey sent to 
6,685 freshmen on Aug. 10, which 
received a total of 1,785 responses 
over three weeks. Approximately 
58 percent of those surveyed 
identified 
as 
female 
and 

approximately 
41 
percent 

identified as male, with 1 percent 
identifying as other. Fifty-three 
percent of respondents are from 
Michigan, while 44 percent hail 
from other states and 2 percent 
are international.

CAMPUS LIFE
Where will freshmen be in 

the fall?

Despite close to 70 percent 

of undergraduate courses being 
taught remotely, 66 percent of 
incoming freshmen surveyed said 
they plan to be on campus in the 
fall, taking at least one in-person 
class. Another 18 percent of 
respondents said they will be 
living on campus and taking all 
online classes, and the other 
six percent reported they will 
live off-campus and take classes 
either online or in-person. Only 
10 percent of those surveyed, 
on the other hand, will be 
completing coursework at home.

How 
comfortable 
are 

incoming 
freshmen 
with 

attending house parties in 
light of COVID-19?

Results show 68.4 percent of 

respondents are either very or 
somewhat uncomfortable with 
attending house parties amid the 
pandemic. The other 31.7 percent 
are either somewhat or very 
comfortable.

Of the freshmen who said 

they were somewhat or very 
comfortable 
with 
attending 

house parties, the majority of 
students were interested or very 
interested 
in 
Fraternity 
and 

Sorority Life.

Concerns 
about 
students 

partying during the pandemic 
have been central to criticism 
of the University’s plan for 
reopening campus. Engineering 
freshman Catherine Jiang is an 
in-state student who is living in 
the dorms this semester. She said 
those going to parties during this 
time are neglecting to protect 
themselves and those around 
them.

“If it was a normal college 

semester, going to parties is like 
whatever, that’s their prerogative 
— you can do whatever you 
want,” Jiang said. “But right now, 
if you’re going out to parties, 
you’re endangering people living 
around you, and you don’t know 
what situations they have at 
home. So it’s like endangering a 
much larger population. And I 
just don’t agree with people who 

are willing to take that risk at this 
current state of the world.”

How interested are incoming 

freshmen in Fraternity and 
Sorority Life?

The University is home to 

more than 60 sororities and 
fraternities, and 17 percent of 
the undergraduate population 
is involved in Fraternity and 
Sorority Life. In recent months, 
certain FSL chapters have been 
the subject of increasing scrutiny 
from college communities for 
enacting exclusionary practices.

LSA freshman Eliana Kraut 

said she is hoping to rush a 
sorority at some point in her 
college experience. She explained 
how the campus social life was 
one of the reasons why she 
decided to attend the University, 
but she said she would rather hold 
off until it is safe before going out.

“That’s part of the reason I 

came to Michigan, among the 
really strong academics, really 
strong art side, the environment, 
football games — parties were 
part of it,” Kraut said. “So now, 
not having that kind of sucks, but 
at the same time, I’d rather it not 
happen until it’s safe, because 
otherwise we just risk being shut 
down and that would be so much 
worse.”

Over the course of the last few 

months, The Daily summer staff 
collaborated to produce a spe-
cial edition on systemic racism, 
titled “Miseducation.” Articles 
from all sections — including 
Michigan in Color, Opinion, 
The Statement, Sports, News, 
Arts and Photo — were curated 
and arranged into different cat-
egories with the ultimate goal 
to educate our community and 
report on the fight for racial jus-
tice in our country and across 
the world. Articles chosen to 

best represent the special edi-
tion are centralized here on a 
Magnify website. 

Our mission statement: As 

students at the University of 
Michigan, we recognize that 
our newsroom, and the Univer-
sity, is a majority white, cis, able-
bodied institution. We have 
taken this summer to create a 
collection of educational mate-
rials which dissect systemic 
tendencies and cultural norms 
which work in tandem to create 
racial inequality in America. We 
have sought to use writing, com-
ics, graphics and video footage 
to discuss issues of education, 
policing, consumerism, slack-

tivism, proper allyship, protests, 
abolition and privilege. This 
collection serves as a reminder 
to the student body, the Univer-
sity administration, the Washt-
enaw County community and 
the nation that this is a diseased 
system which we must invest in 
uprooting religiously. We hope 
“Miseducation” raises aware-
ness and encourages readers to 
educate themselves, their peers, 
their family, colleagues and 
friends in regards to systemic 
oppression and injustice of 
Black and Brown individuals in 
the country. We also hope this 
challenges The Michigan Daily 
staff as a journalistic body to be 

more representative and inten-
tional with all of their articles 
and the information they extend 
to the community. Hopefully 
this project will ignite a passion 
to uphold this responsibility.

Summer staff including Edi-

tor in Chief Emma Stein, Man-
aging Editor Devak Nanua, 
Michigan in Color Managing 
Editors Gabrijela Skoko and 
Cheryn Hong and Editorial 
Page Editor Brittany Bowman 
played key roles in the produc-
tion and curation of “Misedu-
cation.” We also afford a great 
“thank you” to The Daily’s web 
team, for their hard work in cre-
ating the website.

We, the Black Student Union, 

the United Asian American 
Organizations Executive Board, 
La Casa and the Arab Student 
Association E-Board are call-
ing for an end to the Michigan 
Ambassadors 
program. 
We 

demand an intentional, genu-
ine inclusion of our organiza-
tions prior to future Student 
Life decisions. BSU, UAAO, La 
Casa and ASA believe the rea-
sons listed below justify an end 
to the Michigan Ambassadors 
program.

Student Life did not consult 

BSU, UAAO, La Casa and ASA 
in the creation and imple-
mentation of the Michigan 
Ambassadors program. 

While the University called 

our organizations into meet-
ings to discuss policing poli-
cies on campus, they did not 
genuinely give us the opportu-
nity to weigh in on decisions 
that deeply impact the campus 
community and disproportion-
ately affect Black and Brown 
students. On July 1 and July 21, 
2020, Central Student Govern-
ment invited BSU, UAAO, La 
Casa and ASA to discuss polic-
ing on campus. CSG used public 
health concerns to justify their 
plans to increase police pres-
ence on campus and informed 
our 
organizations 
of 
their 

flawed plan to protect students 
of color. This culminated in the 
creation of a voluntary address 
directory where organizations 
could submit their residential 
addresses to Ann Arbor Police 
Department. CSG claimed that 
AAPD would forward com-
plaints of gatherings to the con-
tact point of those organizations 
if there was a disturbance at an 
affiliated address, and that con-
tact point would have 45 min-
utes to see the notification and 
break up the party before the 
police showed up. BSU, UAAO, 
La Casa and ASA took issue 
with CSG’s plan because it did 
not genuinely protect the com-
munities we serve. After this 
meeting, BSU, UAAO, La Casa 
and ASA began to draft our own 
proposals in order to prioritize 
our communities’ safety. There 
was no further communication 
between CSG and our organiza-
tions.

However, before receiving 

the opportunity to release our 
own program, on Aug. 17, 2020, 
Dean of Students Laura Blake 
Jones presented the Wolverine 
Culture of Care Ambassador 
program to the Ann Arbor City 
Council. Dean Jones gave the 
Ann Arbor City Council three 
days’ notice before the pro-
gram’s expected launch date. 
On Aug. 20, the AAPD Twitter 
account posted an announce-
ment 
informing 
both 
their 

followers and the Ann Arbor 
community of the formation of 
canvassing teams, omitting the 
program’s formal name. Two 
hours later, The Michigan Daily 
published an article detail-
ing AAPD and Student Life’s 
ambassador program. On Aug. 
21, Student Life sent out a news-
letter that mentioned the launch 
of the Michigan Ambassadors 
program and the opt-in registry. 

We were blindsided by the 

University’s 
announcement 

of the Michigan Ambassadors 
program before we were able 
to contribute any of our knowl-
edge. Our organizations were 
clearly not at the decision-mak-
ing tables that led to the Michi-
gan Ambassadors program, and 
thus were not consulted mean-
ingfully.

Student Life did not pro-

vide the “Level 1” Michigan 
Ambassadors with bias and/
or 
Diversity, 
Equity 
and 

Inclusion training. 

The University did not dis-

close who, why or how it chose 
its initial canvassers to enforce 
COVID-19 guidelines. While 
these canvassers may not har-
bor any prejudice, there cannot 
be assurance due to the afore-
mentioned lack of communica-
tion and the available training 
modules — which include public 
health information related to 
COVID-19, a basic orientation 
to the Ambassador program, 
conflict 
resolution 
and 
de-

escalation skills and bystander 
intervention skills. Given the 
canvassing role of the Michigan 
Ambassadors, it is inappropri-
ate that the Michigan Ambas-
sador training did not address 
biases, especially with the harm 
of policing disproportionately 
marginalizing race, gender and 
other identities. Without mod-
ules appropriately ensuring that 
ambassadors have a solid under-
standing of racial bias, gender 
bias and broader DEI topics, 
Student Life puts students of 
color in danger. 

The 
Michigan 
Ambassa-

dors program works with Ann 
Arbor Police Department and 
Division of Public Safety and 
Security officers. 

Michigan Ambassadors pro-

gram canvassing teams rely on 
AAPD and DPSS, which build 
upon a historical and cur-
rent legacy of police harming 
communities of color, despite 
President 
Schlissel’s 
claims 

that the Michigan Ambassa-
dors program utilizes peer-to-
peer accountability “to reduce 
the need for law enforce-
ment.” Moreover, the Michigan 
Ambassador program’s use of 
Community Engagement Offi-
cers from DPSS further weap-
onizes existing power dynamics 
to substantiate warnings from 
its 
canvassing 
groups. 
The 

University cannot cultivate an 
inclusive campus community 
while perpetuating an antitheti-
cal dynamic that gives a select 
group of students undue power 
over their peers, allowing hate-
ful attitudes and feelings of 
superiority to fester within can-
vassers. 

The deaths of Breonna Taylor, 

George Floyd, Tony McDade, 
David 
McAtee, 
Rayshard 

Brooks, Daniel Prude, Dijon 
Kizzee, Deon Kay, the near-
fatal shooting of Jacob Blake 
and countless others build on 
this legacy of police distrust and 
cannot be overlooked in pro-
moting public health and safety.

BSU, UAAO, La Casa and 

ASA demand the Univer-
sity respond to these tan-
gible action items in order to 
address the needs of students 
of color.

If the University, AAPD and 

DPSS are to create a system of 
peer-to-peer 
accountability 

— as emphasized by President 
Schlissel — then the Univer-
sity must hold itself to the same 
standard of accountability. To 
achieve institutional account-
ability, the Division of Student 
Life, AAPD and DPSS must be 
transparent and public about 
who is responsible for the cre-
ation and implementation of the 
ambassador program, how Stu-
dent Life recruited and selected 
ambassadors, the relationship 
between the Michigan Ambas-
sadors program and AAPD and 
which University offices are the 
ambassadors’ point of contact.

Additionally, if the Universi-

ty, AAPD and DPSS are to create 
a system that’s dedicated to, as 
Student Life puts it, “facilitating 
student learning and the devel-
opment of the whole student 
while cultivating a diverse and 
inclusive campus community,” 
then Student Life must forefront 
the voices of students of color to 
have jurisdiction over-policing 
on campus. U-M Student Life 
must commit to intentional, 
genuine inclusion of our orga-
nizations prior to any deci-
sion regarding campus safety 
and communication regarding 
policing on campus.

Fellow students and Univer-

sity constituents, there are tan-
gible action items that you can 
complete to join us in calling for 
an end to the Michigan Ambas-
sadors program. Anyone may 
sign this statement, as an indi-
vidual or organization, in sup-
port of our message through this 
Signature Form (https://tinyurl.

Furthermore, 

we created a Michigan Ambas-
sadors Program Concerns Form 
(https://tinyurl.com/y4gny6r3), 
open to all submissions, to help 
us build our case in calling for 
an end to the Michigan Ambas-
sadors program.

YOUR WEEKLY

ARIES

With Mars, your ruling planet, 
turning retrograde, this is your 
chance to dial down the noise and 
to turn inward for a while. Focus 
on getting the background details 

right at work; good 
preparation now will 
ensure success later. 

AQUARIUS

GEMENI

If you need financial or practical 
assistance, distant family 
members may be willing to step 
in - it doesn't hurt to ask. 
Meanwhile, Mars Retrograde 

asks you to tone down 
your social life for a bit. 
Enjoy your own 
company for a change. 

SAGITTARIUS

CANCER

Mars Retrograde in your 
ambitions zone suggests that 
you've been focusing too much on 
trying to get ahead. Let work take 
care of itself this week and 

instead, focus on your 
interpersonal 
relationships. 
Communicate, love and 
communicate again. 

TAURUS

Mars turns retrograde in your 
spiritual zone, so now it's time to 
allow spirit to unfurl around you, 
instead of trying to force spiritual 
growth. Keep an eye out for 

synchronicities and 
weird happenings, but 
essentially, stop trying 
too hard.

The Sun-Jupiter trine opens up 
business opportunities, especially 
if you are, or would like to be 
self-employed. This is an 
excellent time to sell your talents 

and abilities to the wider 
world. Focus locally to 
begin with due to the 
Mars Retrograde. 

Read your weekly horoscopes from astrology.tv

Some of the anger and hostility 
you feel towards others is being 
directed inward now with Mars 
Retrograde -which isn't healthy. 
Seek a more positive outlet for all 

that angst, whether 

that's through sports or 
the creative arts. 

If your relationship has been going 
through a rough patch, things 
should settle down a little as 
warrior planet Mars turns 
retrograde in your love zone. 

Adopt a calmer approach. 

It's a good time to 
investigate, as a couple, 
your shared spiritual 
links. 

Things may start to become rather 
disorganized this week, as Mars 
Retrogrades in your everyday 
zone. Don't be surprised to feel 
tired or lethargic. You can keep up 

your energy via positive 

socia I interactions with 

friends. Say yes to those 
invitations! 

You're not normally one to play it 
safe, but with Mars now 
retrograde in your risk zone, your 
urge is to protect the status quo. 
You can use this period as a 

breathing space, or 

perhaps work on a 

long-term plan for 
your future 
ambitions. 

Family life should become more 
peaceful and less drama-filled for 
a while this week, as Mars 
Retrogrades in your home zone. 
With some extra free time on your 

hands, this is a great time 

to look into expanding 

your education. 

Choosing to believe the best of 
people is a good strategy this 
week. The SunJupiter trine makes 
it much easier to deal with difficult 
emotional situations, as you can 

spread love and optimism. 

Keep your spirits and 
your moral standards 
high. 

A shortage of money could result 
from Mars turning retrograde in 
your finance zone - perhaps you 
no longer have the energy for a 
side hustle. It's temporary. If 
you're doing less work, however, 

be sure to spend that 
time wisely with your 
loved ones.

It is difficult to chalk up 

truth, emotion and produc-
tive analysis into a piece of 
literature — worthy of pub-
lishing or being seen by oth-
ers — when talking about a 
body of people you consider 
your world, your light, your 
kin and your spirit; it is dif-
ficult to know what to say to 
a group of people, looking 
at you to produce “content”, 
when you want to say nothing 
and you feel you know noth-
ing.

What I know is this: Amer-

ican society, along with the 
large majority of the world, 
runs off of indoctrinated 
thought. This is not to con-
demn any individual or to 
suggest that this societal 
functioning or any group is 
inferior — it is not to place 
judgement on anyone or any-
thing in any way. It is to say 
that we as a large body of 
people, who are inherently 
good willed, have a respon-
sibility to start living with 
compassion as a principal of 
life — that we must see one 
another as extensions of our-
selves and guide one another 
in compassion to a greater 
way of being.

In the beginning of the 

summer, I felt a responsi-
bility to respond somehow 
to the uproar of anti-racist 
activism spreading the globe. 
I felt a responsibility to say 
something on behalf of the 
newspaper. I wrote editori-
als with my co-managing 
editor Cheryn Hong and the 
editorial page editor Brittany 
Bowman, who are two boldly 
intelligent 
beings, 
capable 

of more than even they have 
begun to imagine. The three 
of us took on this project for 
the summer, which has now 
extended into the school year 
and will probably go on for 
longer than any of us ever 
expected. I am proud of it 
and of them, and of our writ-
ers, editors, our photo team, 
graphic designers, our video 
team and our web design-
ers who all made it happen. 
With that being said, it does 
not satisfy much. This is not 
to say the work is not incred-

ible, that it is not powerful 
or significant — it just means 
we have done the minimum, 
we have begun and we have 
enormous ways to go; a life-
time. 

There is a lot to be said 

about racism in America and 
in the world. There has been 
a lot of conversation about 
revolution in recent months, 
a passionate response to a 
sort 
of 
“awakened” 
soci-

ety following the killing of 
George Floyd — mind you this 
societal awakening alone is a 
sort of unfortunate and sym-
bolic truth about America 
reminding Black people that 
these last two hundred years 
of civil right efforts have fall-
en upon broken ears. I want 
to help, but in all of my small 
efforts — like our wMiseduca-
tion project here at The Daily 
and sporadic protests across 
spring and summer months 
— I end in a sort of unsatis-
fied hopelessness. I believe it 
is rooted in an understand-
ing that I have only done so 
much, or so little. I feel this 
persistent and inexplicable 
passion to pursue ‘freedom’ 
for society, but for so long I 
looked at the word as some 
ominous future, intangible. 
What was essential for me 
was to instead pursue intel-
lectual, spiritual and psycho-
logical development — and 
ultimately, to pursue every-
thing with compassion. 

I have spent a large major-

ity of my time honoring the 
Greats, to name a few: Bob 
Marley, Damian “Jr Gong” 
Marley, Ms. Lauryn Hill, 
Erykah 
Badu, 
Mos 
Def, 

Tupac, Talib Kweli and Nas. 
They have taught me about 
the world through myself and 
most importantly, my mind. 
I want to share some of their 
words with you all. 

A song that has at some 

times engulfed me, by Nas, 
titled “You Can’t Stop Us 
Now” celebrates our power, 
our truth and our passion 
while 
confronting 
numer-

ous mediums and systems 
through which the Black 
and Indigenous communi-
ties have been exploited and 
oppressed. The first verse 
following into the chorus 
goes like this: “I know your 
hunger, kid. I know they hung 

your dad, burnt your mama 
crib. I know that hurt you bad. 
Minstrel shows, from gold to 
shackles and back to gold. We 
act like we home, matter fact, 
we are home. Bad attitudes, 
octoroon skin tone. Slave 
food turned to soul food, col-
lards and neck bones. Betsy 
Ross sewed the first Ameri-
can flag, but she had a n**** 
with her to help her old ass. 
As James Baldwin says ‘You 
can only be destroyed by 
believing that you really are 
what the white world consid-
ers a n*****. No matter how 
hard you try, you can’t stop 
us now. No matter how hard 
you try, you can’t stop us now. 
Can’t be stopped.” 

Whether speaking literally 

or metaphorically, Nas first 
pays homage to the reality of 
being a Black kid in America 
and travels through history 
spanning oppressive abuse, 
exploitation, rape. He cir-
cles back, reminds us this is 
indoctrinated thought, that 
no matter how much effort 
has been put into neutraliz-
ing our mentalities or ridding 
us of our identities — our his-
tories — we will prevail. 

Mos Def pays these injus-

tices a similar respect in his 
song “Mathematics”: “Kill-
ing fields need blood to graze 
the cash cow. It’s a numbers 
game, but shit don’t add up 
somehow. Like I got sixteen 
to thirty-two bars to rock it, 
but only 15% of profits, ever 
see my pockets like, sixty-
nine billion in the last twen-
ty years spent on national 
defense but folks still live in 
fear like nearly half of Ameri-
ca’s largest cities is one-quar-
ter black. That’s why they 
gave Ricky Ross all the crack. 
Sixteen ounces to a pound, 
twenty more to a ki, A five 
minute sentence hearing and 
you no longer free. 40% of 
Americans own a cell phone, 
so they can hear everything 
that you say when you ain’t 
home. I guess Michael Jack-
son was right, ‘You Are Not 
Alone’...Young teens and pris-
on greens facing life num-
bers. Crack mothers, crack 
babies and AIDS patients. 
Youngbloods can’t spell but 
they could rock you in Play-
Station. This new math is 
whipping 
motherfuckers 

ass. You wanna know how to 
rhyme, you better learn how 
to add, it’s mathematics.” 

He closes with an ode to 

the struggle of being a Black 
body and a warning, “Young 
soldiers trying to earn their 
next stripe. When the average 
minimum wage is $5.15, you 
best believe you gotta find a 
new ground to get cream. The 
white unemployment rate is 
nearly more than triple for 
black, so front liners got their 
gun in your back. Bubbling 
crack, jewel theft and robbery 
to combat poverty and end up 
in the global jail economy. 
Stiffer stipulations attached 
to each sentence, budget cut-
backs but increased police 
presence and even if you get 
out of prison still living, join 
the other five million under 
state supervision. This is 
business, no faces just lines 
and statistics. From your 
phone, your zip code, to S-S-I 
digits. 
The 
system 
break 

man, child and women into 
figures; Two columns for 
who is, and who ain’t n****s. 
Numbers are hardly real and 
they never have feelings, but 
you push too hard, even num-
bers got limits. Why did one 
straw break the camel’s back? 
Here’s the secret: The million 
other straws underneath it, 
it’s all mathematics.”

Though Nas and Mos Def 

both sow a certain sorrow 
into their lyricism, there is 
also a bold conclusion coming 
from their work — they have 
both come to understand that 
this senile history, the conse-
quential modern institutions 
of slavery and the racism that 
has pervaded society exists 
separate from our existence. 
The sentiment of Black infe-
riority is a sort of world or 
mindset, it is not a truth to be 
burdened with. The physical 
manifestations of pain and 
strife that have confronted 
Black and Indigenous com-
munities because of this are 
what we seek a solution to, 
and we must continue to do 
so until we resolve a greater 
problem, but it is the human-
ity itself that is in dire need of 
resolution. 

Ms. Lauryn Hill has put out 

invaluable work in her life-
time, my favorite being her 
work from “MTV Unplugged 

No. 2.0”. This album is a 
tribute to spirit and a com-
plete understanding of self. 
It serves as a rejection to our 
social systems and to our way 
of life; it serves as an accep-
tance of the truth, which you 
must pursue on your own 
with diligence and great curi-
osity. I want to share excerpts 
from three different songs. 

First, 
“Mr. 
Intentional”, 

speaking to the individual 
and community ego that pro-
hibits us from true progress: 
“We give rise to ego by being 
insecure. The advice that we 
go desperately searching for. 
The subconscious effort to 
support our paramour. To 
engage in denial, to admit 
we’re immature. Validating 
lies, Mr. Intentional. Open 
up your eyes, Mr. Intentional. 
Stuck in a system that seeks 
to suck your blood. Held 
emotionally hostage by what 
everybody does. Counting all 
the money that you give them 
just because. Exploiting igno-
rance in the name of love…”

In “Adam Lives in Theory”, 

the same analysis continues: 
“Masquerading like he got it 
figured out. Cut off from the 
sunshine, only smart in his 
own head, leaving his descen-
dants to hope and doubt. Left 
to his devices, those worth-
less sacrifices, praying to the 
altar of himself. Making pil-
grimages, thinking he’s reli-
gious, like he’s got all the light 
and no one else. He takes the 
unsuspected, cause he knows 
they’re not connected, and he 
shows them how to be just as 
he is. Virtually real, and com-
mercially appealed, 

to the lust of all the people 

where he lives.” She closes 
the song with this, “Now if 
we can agree with who cre-
ated us to be, who says we’re 
guilty everyone before his 
eyes. Making no exceptions, 
since the day of our concep-
tion, predisposed to hating 
truth and loving lies. Stop 
walking in pride, let the thief 
be crucified. Unlearn every-
thing you know and let Him 
teach you; Line upon line, 
and precept upon precept, 
say goodbye to this decaying 
social system.”

When 
you 
pursue 
the 

development of yourself, you 
pursue the world, because 
once you understand com-
pletely who you are, once you 
accept change as a principle 
of life and you live in com-
plete empathy, you will have 
the ability to give everything 
to the world. With this how-
ever, is a responsibility to 
pursue an ever-evolving edu-
cation in order to maintain a 
solid conscience regarding 
self and the world through-
out continuously challenging 
social systems.

Damian “Jr Gong” Marley 

and Nas share an album that 
should be treated like clas-
sic literature, to be pursued 
continuously 
throughout 

life, called “Distant Rela-
tives” — in which they con-
front 
the 
aforementioned 

social systems while also 
confronting the personality 
that comes from living with-
in the system, challenging 
their audience to begin with 
deconstructing this illusive 
“self” they have created. In 
their track “Patience”, Mar-
ley begins, “Pay no mind to 
the youths ‘cause it’s not like 
the future depends on it, but 
save the animals in the zoo 
‘cause the chimpanzee them 
make big money; This is how 
the media pillages, on TV 
the picture is savages in vil-
lages, and the scientist still 
can’t explain the pyramids. 
Evangelists making a living 
on the videos of ribs of the 
little kids; stereotyping the 
image of the images and this 
is what the image is.” He con-
tinues, “Some of the worst 
paparazzi’s I’ve ever seen and 
I’ve ever known put the worst 
on display so the world can 
see and that’s all they will 
ever show. So the ones in the 
west will never move east and 
feel they could be at home, 
get tricked by the Beast but 
where they gon’ flee when 
the monster is fully grown? 
Solomonic 
lineage 
where 

they can’t defeat and they 

could never clone my spiritu-
al DNA that prints in my soul 
and I will forever own, Lord.” 

In the next verse, Marley 

asks for introspection:, “Are 
we growing wiser, or are we 
just growing taller?

Can you read thoughts? 

Can you read palms? Can you 
predict the future? Can you 
see storms coming?

The Earth was flat, if you 

went too far, you would fall 
off. Now the Earth is round, 
if the shape changes again, 
everybody would start laugh-
ing. The average man can’t 
prove most of the things that 
he chooses to speak of. And 
still won’t research and find 
out the root of the truth that 
you speak of. Scholars teach 
in universities and claim that 
they’re smart and cunning. 
Tell them to find a cure when 
we sneeze and that’s when 
their nose starts running.” 

The 
more 
one 
pursues 

themselves and the world, 
the more one understands 
within these excerpts. All of 
these prophets have shared 
one recurring and ever pres-
ent thought which is that 
these oppressive institutions 
and the thought that inspires 
them are not the way of life, 
but rather a social system 
that we have all succumbed 
to and lived within. 

Bob Marley is the founda-

tion of revolution music. He 
is a foundation of revolu-
tion, a well of compassion 
and a prophet of sorts. I want 
to offer this sermon from 
“War”: “Until the philosophy 
which holds one race superior 
and another inferior is finally 
and permanently discredited 
and abandoned, everywhere 
is war, Me say war. That until 
there are no longer first class 
and second class citizens of 
any nation, until the color 
of a man’s skin is of no more 
significance than the color 
of his eyes, me say war.” He 
continues, “That until that 
day the dream of lasting 
peace, world citizenship, rule 
of international morality, will 
remain in but a fleeting illu-
sion to be pursued, but never 
attained, now everywhere is 
war. War. And until the igno-
ble and unhappy regimes that 
hold our brothers in Ango-
la, in Mozambique, South 
Africa, Sub-human bondage, 
have been toppled, utterly 
destroyed, well, everywhere 
is war. Me say war.” 

I promise to put my entire 

being into working toward 
a world and society beyond 
anything we can imagine in 
our 
current 
indoctrinated 

state — a world where what 
I’m 
saying 
doesn’t 
sound 

painfully radical, but rather 
a long overdue understanding 
that to call notions of equal-
ity, peace, equity, love and 
compassion should be prin-
ciples of life. 

I want to end with the third 

excerpt from Ms. Lauryn 
Hill. This is from one of my 
favorite songs of all time. The 
song is “I Get Out”. In it, she 
preaches this: 

I won’t be compromised no 

more. I can’t be victimised no 
more. I just don’t sympathize 
no more ‘cause now I under-
stand. You just want to use 
me. You say “love” then abuse 
me. You never thought you’d 
lose me, but how quickly we 
forget that nothin’ is for cer-
tain. You thought I’d stay 
here hurtin’. Your guilt trip’s 
just not workin’. Repressin’ 
me to death.’Cause now I’m 
choosin’ life, yo. I’ll take the 
sacrifice, yo. If everything 
must go, then go, that’s how I 
choose to live... No more com-
promises. I see past your dis-
guises. Blindin’ through mind 
control. Stealin’ my eter-
nal soul. Appealin’ through 
material. To keep me as your 
slave. But I get out… Knowin’ 
my condition, oh, is the rea-
son I must change...I’ve just 
accepted what you said, kee-
pin’ me among the dead. The 
only way to know is to walk 
then learn and grow. But 
faith is not your speed, oh, 
you’ve had everyone believe 
that you’re the sole author-
ity. Just follow the majority. 
Afraid to face reality. The 
system is a joke.``

Legacy and liberation: an ode to the Greats

Opinion

I

t’s highly likely that the folks 
reading this are younger 
rather than older. You’re 

probably reading this on your 
computer or phone. Maybe you’re 
laying in bed, e-commuting to class 
or, most likely of all, sitting on the 
toilet. Whatever you’re doing while 
reading, I’m positive this next part 
will spark some curiosity, cause 
you to miss a step or — hopefully, 
because that’d be funny — produce 
a combo of the two. Contrary to 
the invincibility complex of young 
adulthood’s hype, you, reader, are 
not too young to have heart disease. 
Before you object, I challenge you 
to take a deep breath and keep 
reading. It could save your life.

I’m 
propagandist-level 

enthusiastic 
about 
preventive 

medicine and early intervention 
because there’s something about 
being in control of one’s health that 
feels naturally good. I’m the kind 
of guy who signs up to get the flu 
vaccine the first day it’s available 
at CVS Pharmacy. Who practices 
intermittent fasting most days of 
the week. Who’s always on the 
lookout for new evidence-backed 
senotherapeutics. 
Who, 
after 

noticing the slightest androgenic 
alopecia this year, started taking 
Propecia 
(it’s 
working!). 
I’ve 

been a runner since 2018, and my 
waistline (and arms) pleasantly 
bear witness. I haven’t eaten red 
meat or pork for half a decade, and 
I’m not really a natural fan of birds 
and fish, either. 

I don’t write any of this to build 

myself up. I work really hard to 
be well now because I want to be 
present for others later. I want to be 
around to meet my great (at least)-
grandkids, see life-saving rather 
than 
life-extending 
treatments 

arrive 
for 
humankind’s 
most 

offensive cancers and celebrate a 
majority non-white United States. 
I have — just as you do and every 
generation before ours did — a lot 
of good to offer my fellow humans. 
The opportunities for us to exceed 
expectations and right our parents’ 
wrongs are literally limitless. The 
way things are going now, though, I 
just want enough time to finish my 
education (not necessarily to have 
to pay back the loans, though).

Which is why I’m writing this. 
I received some blood work Aug. 

24, and it looked nothing like it 
should. Instead of an active, plant-
based, health-obsessed 25-year old 
guy, my veins and arteries look like 
a 60-year old’s who loves tobacco 
as much as he hates exercises. I 
went to see my doctor the next day. 
Here’s what she told me:

Adult men’s total cholesterol 

should be less than 200 milligrams 
per deciliter. 

My total cholesterol is nearly 

32 percent higher than it should 
be. My LDL (“bad”) cholesterol 
should be less than 100 mg/dL. 
I’m carrying 65 percent more than 
that. My HDL (“good”) cholesterol 
should be 60 mg/dL or higher. I 
didn’t make the cut-off.

“If we don’t get this under 

control now,” she said, “you’ve 
got about a 50 percent probability 
of living to 60 and roughly 40 
percent of having a heart attack 
before 50.” That translates into 
a roughly 90-fold increased risk 
for 
developing 
cardiovascular 

disease in the next decade or so. 
My stomach twisted into knots of 
anxiety. I’m not much of a crier, but 
I felt tears well up. 

Why was my blood so unhealthy? 

Well, apparently, it’s always been 
that way. I was diagnosed with a 
relatively common — if you call 
one in 250 (0.4 percent) common 
— atherogenic genetic disorder 
called 
heterozygous 
familial 

hypercholesterolemia 
(FH). 

I’ve had atherosclerotic plaques 
building in my blood vessels since 
I was born, and no amount of 
exercise nor leafy greens would’ve 
been enough to keep me safe. It 
means my two sisters each have a 
50 percent chance of having it, too. 
It also means my kids will have a 50 
percent chance of being born with 
it, and that it’s likely behind the 
very premature death of my uncle.

Just 
15-20 
percent 
of 

individuals with FH are diagnosed 
and only 16 percent of those 
individuals are on cholesterol-
lowering 
pharmacotherapy. 

This is despite medications, 
known 
as 
statins, 
being 

extremely helpful for managing 
FH. Usually, a diagnosis isn’t 
made 
until 
a 
catastrophic 

(and 
completely 
preventable) 

cardiovascular event has already 
occurred, such as myocardial 
infarction or stroke — an age-
unbiased event which can easily 
be fatal. The reality that FH is 
very underdiagnosed due to poor 
awareness in the population 
combined with the coronavirus’s 
tendency to damage the human 
cardiovascular 
system 
would 

spell disaster for folks of all ages 
with hidden FH — including 
myself. If I had come down with 
COVID-19, I would’ve stood 
little chance. Seeing as COVID-
19 doesn’t seem to be going 
anywhere, knowing what I know 
now stings a little more.

I’m by no means saying you 

need to run out and wrangle 
yourself 
a 
cardiologist 
today, 

tomorrow or even this month. For 
many of us, youth is indeed on our 
cardiovascular side. That said, the 
coronavirus is a known cause of 
premature stroke and clotting in 
young, otherwise healthy people, 
as well as arrhythmia, myocarditis, 
cardiac ischemia and sudden 
death. Fully one in three COVID-19 
patients develop cardiomyopathy 
and in many cases, the virus could 
increase risks of heart failure. And 
as we go further into this thing, 
it’s younger people — like, our age 
— whose case numbers are on the 
rise. This should and does concern 
you directly. The best bet with 
your health is to know what you’re 
up against earlier rather than later 
(when catching up is a lot harder).

The COVID-19 pandemic may 

be a once-in-a-century occurrence, 
but it’s still within the realm 
of applicability of physicians’ 
eternal recommendations to eat 
healthfully, 
exercise 
regularly 

and undergo yearly physical and 
laboratory examinations. When 
individuals know the goings-on 
of their insides, they’re bound to 
make better health decisions for 
themselves and others by proxy. 
Beyond simply reaping the benefits 
from preventive medicine we all 
know about — at least abstractly 
— as young people, knowing our 
individual numbers empowers us 
with clearer, fuller choice-making 
capacity for the present and the 
future. If you truly want to express 
bodily autonomy, consider learning 
about the biological and chemical 
systems that make you, well ... you. 

Be proud of your body and take 

care of it. It’s the only one you 
have. Schedule a physical with 
your doctor, especially if you have 
a family history of early heart 
disease, high cholesterol, diabetes 
or obesity. One last statistic: from an 
estimate based on the total number 
of students at the University of 
Michigan, roughly 192 current 
Wolverines have FH. They are 192 
friends, brothers, students, sisters, 
sons, daughters, partners. I don’t 
have to know you to take pride in 
our shared missions as Wolverines, 
and the world we have right now 
can’t afford to lose a single one of 
us. Know your numbers because 
youth is no guarantee.

FROM THE DAILY

The University can do more to protect 

its community

T

he University of Michigan’s reopening has been fraught with challenges 
and has met much criticism from faculty, students and Ann Arbor 
residents alike. Messaging from upper administration and University 

President Mark Schlissel throughout the summer months leading up to reopening 
has been remarkably inconsistent. From saying that the assertion that students 
won’t follow safety protocol is “offensive” to analogizing student violations of 
distancing guidelines to the HIV epidemic, Schlissel especially has come under 
severe scrutiny, resulting in the consideration of a vote of no confidence by the 
Faculty Senate. Reports of precautionary guidelines being unenforced during 
undergraduate move-in and unlawful student gatherings have only compounded 
on an increasing lack of faith in the University’s flawed reopening strategy. 

We are calling on University 

leadership to re-evaluate its current 
plan for the fall 2020 semester. 
Provisions 
must 
include 
better 

contact tracing and the use of 
alternate testing methods, such 
as weekly wastewater testing in 
residence halls to monitor possible 
outbreaks and saliva testing, which is 
less invasive than the traditional nasal 
swab and expedites results so contact 
tracing and quarantining can be 
administered rapidly. The University 
must also follow the guidelines they 
have already put into place, ensuring 
that Student Life staff enforce mask 
guidelines and no-guest policies 
in dorms, as well as outlining the 
protocol 
for 
repercussions 
for 

violations. To ensure the efficacy 
of this enforcement, the University 
must 
provide 
quality 
personal 

protective equipment to University 
faculty, staff and Student Life 
employees.

The innumerable flaws in the 

current fall 2020 reopening plan, 
along with its execution, have been 
impacting the Ann Arbor and 
University community unequally. 
We acknowledge that there are 
those who rely on some U-M classes 
being held in person, but the lack of 
robust planning to allow for those 
necessary classes to take place will 
only serve to weaken the institution 
even further in the long term. The 
University has been overworking 
Student Life staff without providing 
adequate protection. Leadership has 
acknowledged but pushed against 
calls for widespread and alternative 
testing. Last-minute announcements 
and lack of adequate protections 
overall have put students, especially 
international students, students of 
color and low-income students, at 
risk since the partial closure of the 
University in March. 

The University has failed to come 

up with a response sufficient for the 
scope of the problem in some of the 
most basic ways, particularly where 
housing is concerned. Not only 
are dorms operating at 70 percent 
capacity right now despite the percent 
of strictly online undergraduate 
classes being 78 percent, but they’re 

also operating in such a way that 
they fall under the CDC’s “more risk” 
category — as do all University spaces, 
currently. Guidelines like staying six 
feet apart and not sharing objects 
are the minimum precautions an 
institution can take right now. Many 
comparable universities have done 
far more to minimize the number 
of bodies on campus. Less than 10 
percent of University of Washington 
undergraduate classes are in person, 
compared to our 31 percent; Harvard 
University and University of Chicago 
dorms are at 40 percent capacity, 
compared to our 70 (and everyone 
gets their own room); Georgetown 
University is housing 2,000 students, 
dwarfed by our on-campus freshman 
count alone; Brown, Princeton, 
Columbia, Stanford and Yale are 
all alternating based on year which 
students can be on-campus, rather 
than welcoming everyone back at 
once.

While some college students 

rely on an open campus for food, 
housing and basic amenities like a 
stable internet connection, Michigan 
students are exceedingly unlikely 
to be in this situation based on their 
financial demographics. Add to this 
the fact that the few basic regulations 
the University has offered are, more 
often than not, going unenforced, 
and it becomes clear that the blame 
cannot fall squarely on the shoulders 
of students. Yes, we are already on 
campus, but that doesn’t mean it’s 
too late for the University to make 
changes and move people out when 
there’s no need for them to be there 
— that’s precisely what happened 
last March. We are calling upon 
the University to respond to the 
pandemic with the gravity it deserves 
and do as much as possible to protect 
its staff and students, rather than as 
little as possible. 

As a university with such an 

immense pool of resources, there is no 
reason we cannot adapt to our current 
circumstances, if not lead the way for 
colleges across the U.S. Michigan 
is ranked among the best colleges 
for medical research in the country 
and even the most innovative in 
general. COVID-19 related research 

is being conducted in a multitude of 
University programs, as it ought to be, 
but we’re still behind when it comes 
to implementing our knowledge 
into our plan of action. At present, 
required testing is limited to those 
who are already exhibiting symptoms 
or who have had close contact with 
someone else who has tested positive. 
The University recently announced 
a new opt-in surveillance testing 
program that aims to test 3,000 
individuals by the end of September. 
This program is a step in the right 
direction, but its effectiveness for a 
campus community of over 40,000 
remains to be seen.

It can be true that asymptomatic 

testing is less important than other 
measures, as this guide is quick to 
state, while also being true that if 
we have the means, we should do so 
anyway — and with one of the largest 
endowments in the U.S., it is hard 
to argue we don’t have the means. 
The current contact tracing method 
similarly falls short, limited to a phone 
call about proper quarantine to those 
close to individuals who test positive; 
much more effective is “retrospective” 
contact tracing, in which tracers look 
for the sources of their cases, not just 
possible resulting cases. At the very 
least, the University should also be 
testing proactively rather than relying 
solely on individuals to voluntarily 
test themselves. Rochester Institute 
of Technology’s testing of residence 
hall wastewater and similar forms of 
pool testing are simple but effective 
at monitoring large populations like 
our student body, and we believe the 
University should take advantage of 
them. 

We’ve been told over and over 

again that it is an unprecedented time 
and that no one is to blame except the 
virus. However, the University had 
the time to plan for this fall and the 
resources to do far more than that 
plan entails. We cannot expect such 
a large, interwoven population of 
people to make it through a pandemic 
on bare minimum precautions. If the 
University insists on having an open 
campus and in-person classes, it must 
act to make sure this system is as safe 
as possible for everyone.

O

ver the last few months, 
the University of Michigan 
has issued guidelines and 

rules for its students regarding the 
ongoing spread of COVID-19. Of 
course, 
intelligent 
containment 

efforts are necessary, as COVID-19 
represents a serious threat to the 
health of the University community 
and the challenges administrators 
face 
are 
remarkably 
difficult. 

However, this containment goal 
does not justify the means the 
University is employing. Further, 
it is what the University risks by 
employing these means that matters. 
The directives the University has 
issued and the means by which 
they intend to enforce them violate 
the higher-order principles that 
constitute the University’s mission 
as an institute of higher learning.

The manner in which the 

University is monitoring contact 
tracing risks an invasion of privacy. 
Contact tracing — the attempt to 
track who has come into contact 
with whom, and by extension, who 
is at risk of infection — is acceptable 
in principle. Contact tracing is a tool. 
The question is how it is being used or 
enforced. The University’s recently 
announced 
program 
protects 

students’ autonomy by making it 
a voluntary opt-in. However, in 
the University’s FAQ page under 
the heading “What is U-M’s plan 
of COVID-19 testing and contact 
tracing?” they note that students 
will be allowed to manage contact 
tracing efforts under the supervision 
of professionals. In addition, per the 
Recognized Student Organization 
safety 
measures, 
RSOs 
must 

keep meeting rosters for 30 days 
and, “when directed by U-M 
administrators,” must provide a list 
of those in attendance. RSOs must 
also report to the Center for Campus 
Involvement should any of their 
attendees test positive for COVID-
19, though it’s unclear whether they 

are required to report students’ 
names or the organizations they 
are affiliated with. The issue is that 
administrators and fellow students 
— not health officials bound to 
protect the privacy of their patients 
— will be conducting contact tracing 
efforts.

Chillingly, these efforts extend 

off-campus, beyond the purview 
of the University. Recently, the 
University posted a job listing for 
the Michigan Ambassadors. These 
ambassadors are responsible for “Off-
campus Community Canvassing 
Responsibilities,” which comprises 
70 percent of their responsibilities. 
This suggests that these students 
will be confronting and reporting 
individuals off-campus, leaving the 
ill-defined scope of their jurisdiction 
remarkably broad. This must also 
be done through a “diversity, equity, 
and inclusion lens,” suggesting 
that one’s gender, racial, ethnic or 
religious background will be taken 
into account and, hopefully, held to 
the same standard, when canvassing 
and enforcing the rules. While this 
may be the University’s attempt 
to mitigate discrimination against 
protected classes, it would seem that 
the University may still be risking the 
unequal enforcement of its policies 
off-campus. 
Furthermore, 
the 

Ann Arbor Police Department and 
the University of Michigan Police 
Department “response teams” will be 
deployed if an emergency is reported 
through a hotline the University has 
set up, and the circumstances of this 
call can be reported to the Office of 
Student Conflict Resolution and the 
Dean of Students Office. Assuming 
the University’s guidelines aren’t a 
perfect reflection of the laws that 
AAPD is responsible for enforcing, 
by what right can AAPD enforce the 
University’s guidelines, which don’t 
reflect those laws? Furthermore, the 
academic and personal consequences 
of such reporting remain unclear. 

For some, it may be difficult to 

see past the potential risk of not 
implementing these measures. 
But the risk to the privacy of 
students among us and those 
non-students who may be caught 
in the fray — who could suffer 
dearly when who they associate 
with is revealed — is equally as 
great. For example, say a student 
who is gay or questioning their 
sexuality and has not opened up 
about this to anyone. This person 
would be deeply concerned about 
their privacy. They may go to an 
LGBTQ+-related RSO meeting 
to find answers or meet like-
minded individuals. They may go 
to a party with fellow members 
of 
the 
LGBTQ+ 
community, 

risking exposure to the virus. 
Maintaining 
their 
privacy 

outweighs that calculated risk. 
However, 
the 
aforementioned 

University 
guidelines 
risk 

potentially outing students in 
situations such as these, the 
consequences 
of 
which 
are 

personal and grave. Because they 
may be exposed in the most public 
way one could imagine — by one 
of their fellow students showing 
up to their gathering, calling a 
hotline, having the police show up 
to their door and reporting all of 
the names of those who gathered 
to administrators and fellow 
students — that person’s privacy 
and journey to personal identity 
would be sacrificed on the altar of 
“care.” And all of this could occur 
in a place where the University 
has no right to impose its power: 
off-campus.

I

t seems like every day 
the president finds a 
new way to attack the 

legitimacy of the upcoming 
presidential 
election. 
In 

2016, then-candidate Donald 
Trump 
refused 
to 
accept 

the results of that year’s 
election unless he won. But 
his 
most 
recent 
offense, 

which is garnering support 
among the fringe supporters 
of his reelection campaign, 
has been to eliminate and 
invalidate mail-in voting. 

This administration has 

begun attacks on our postal 
system to make sure that 
mail-in votes are delayed, 
not counted and not even 
cast in the first place. He 
is 
opposing 
new 
funding 

to the United States Postal 
Service, suing Nevada for 
expanding access to mail-
in 
ballots, 
intimidating 

voters by making the only 
method of voting in-person 
— 
something 
increasingly 

dangerous in a pandemic — 
and discouraging Americans 
from trusting the validity 
of 
their 
absentee 
votes. 

By doing this, Trump has 
once again set himself up to 
deny the results of the 2020 
election and to use mail-in 
voting as a way to claim that 
it was “rigged” if he loses.

Trump went on a Twitter 

rant regarding the alleged 
illegitimacy 
of 
mail-in 

voting 
while 
the 
death 

toll from COVID-19 in the 
U.S. 
surpassed 
180,000. 

Beyond his dangerous and 
unconstitutional proposal of 
delaying a federal election, 
and beyond his false claim 
that 
absentee 
voting 
is 

somehow more secure than 
mail-in 
voting 
(they’re 

essentially the same thing), 
he wants to make voting 
in our country a life or 
death choice for millions 
of Americans based on the 
misinformation 
of 
voting 

practices. 

Trump rages on in his 

efforts 
to 
stop 
mail-in 

voting and at the same time 
pretends that the pandemic 
affecting 
our 
nation 
is 

going away. It is proven that 
COVID-19 disproportionately 
affects 
Black 
and 
Latinx 

communities relative to white 
communities. 
This 
means 

that while a white man may be 
able to vote in person without 
any substantial risk, a Black 
woman, who may need to take 
public transport for a greater 
distance 
and 
wait 
longer 

in line, will be at a greater 
health risk. In addition to 
the racially disproportionate 
health risk posed by the 
pandemic, Trump is further 
disadvantaging 
people 
of 

color 
in 
the 
democratic 

process through his attacks 
on mail-in voting, essentially 
establishing 
21st 
Century 

Jim Crow laws.

When asked about Trump’s 

new 
attack 
on 
voting 
in 

America, 
Allayna 
Hight, 

a 
Black 
LSA 
freshman 

and active member of the 
Multicultural 
Housing 

Community 
on 
campus, 

did 
not 
hold 
back. 
She 

commented, 
“Low-income 

areas 
with 
high 
minority 

populations 
tend 
to 
have 

higher numbers of COVID-
19 cases, and I’m afraid many 
minorities may decide not to 
vote if they can’t do it by mail.” 
She continued, “Especially 
because of the recent events 
surrounding police brutality 
against Black people, I feel 
like it’s more important than 
ever to secure my vote in 

the election. Donald Trump 
does not show any support 
for the Black Lives Matter 
movement and it scares me to 
hear him denounce mail-in 
voting.” 

Though his assault on mail-

in voting disproportionally 
affects 
Black 
Americans, 

this is an issue even white 
people are having to face. 
We white Americans live in, 
and inadvertently support, 
a system that is set up to 
favor us and now we are 
getting a glimpse at what 
Black individuals lived and 
continue to live through. 
We, 
too, 
are 
now 
being 

told that our votes do not 
matter. We, too, are being 
forced to risk our health 
to 
simply 
participate 
in 

this democracy. We must 
acknowledge that we were 
privileged over the past two 
hundred years to be exempt 
from literacy tests, property 
ownership 
requirements, 

purging of names and even 
being subjected to violence 
only for voting. 

Thoughthe voices of support 

for 
the 
Black 
community 

from our predecessors were 
too few and too quiet, we are 
now given another chance to 
defend the right to vote and 
must seize this opportunity. 
That includes passing the 
Voting Rights Advancement 
Act of 2019 to restate our 
commitment to racial justice 
in our electoral process. 

This issue is about whether 

we will let all Americans 
vote safely like so many 
white Americans have in the 
past or force people to risk 
their lives just to have their 
voices heard. Voting is a 
right that must be protected 
with the utmost care, clarity 
and accessibility. What is 
happening now is a president 
taking a move from an old and 
racist playbook to suppress 
his opposition. America is too 
great of a nation to once again 
stay silent as justice and 
democracy fall apart.

A

s 
tribalism 
deepens 

in the United States 
and 
around 
the 

world, political polarization 
follows. 
The 
tendency 
of 

people to group themselves 
based on ideology creates 
environments where beliefs 
outside of one’s norm aren’t 
present and ultimately lead 
to echo chambers that make 
people unable and unwilling 
to listen to other perspectives. 

We can clearly see this 

in the way people become 
ardent fans and supporters of 
the political stars of the day. 
People across the political 
spectrum — from progressives 
to moderate Democrats to 
conservative Republicans — 
have their own politicians 
who they worship without 
question. For example, Rep. 
Alexandria 
Ocasio-Cortez, 

D-NY., Sen. Bernie Sanders, 
I-Vt., former President Barack 
Obama, 
Supreme 
Court 

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
and, lastly, President Donald 
Trump all have their strong 
supporters who find no flaw 
in their policies, beliefs or 
actions. 

When 
people 
start 

admiring someone, it becomes 
inexplicably difficult to find 
flaws. I grew up in the ultra-
liberal Oakland, Calif. and 
Berkeley, 
Calif., 
and 
now 

attend the University here in 
Ann Arbor. In both places, I 
have seen many people shout 
their love of Supreme Court 
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg. 
Sure, there is a lot to love. 
RBG has an inspiring life 
story that includes taking 
care of both her sick husband 
and young child while in law 
school. She has almost become 
a cultural phenomenon due 
to her years defending civil 
liberties as well as her role 
as a liberal dissenter on the 
Supreme Court. An article 
titled “52 Reasons Why Ruth 
Bader Ginsberg is My Favorite 
Human” provides a clearer 
understanding of how deep 
this kind of love goes. 

Articles like this, however, 

also explain why this type 
of worship is dangerous and 
shows a lack of awareness 
and critical thinking. The 
author states that RBG is her 
“favorite human.” While this 
is obviously a hyperbole, it is 
important to remember that 
we know very little about 

politicians and, unfortunately, 
judges are political figures. 
How 
someone 
presents 

themselves 
in 
the 
public 

spotlight is not necessarily 
who they really are. 

Consider some of RBG’s 

other actions. For example, 
her decision not to retire in 
2014 while Obama was still 
president haunts me whenever 
I open Twitter and see “RBG” 
trending. If she had retired 
in 2014, Obama could have 
nominated her replacement, 
ensuring 
a 
liberal 
justice 

on the Supreme Court and 
keeping its relatively even 
balance of four to five liberal 
to 
conservative 
justices. 

If Trump is reelected, he 
will likely fill that spot and 
cause 
the 
Supreme 
Court 

to lean further toward the 
conservative side. RBG also 
joined the Court’s conservative 
majority to allow a natural gas 
pipeline to be built under the 
Appalachian Trail, a project 
both environmentalists and 
several 
Native 
American 

tribes 
oppose. 
Liberal 

Democrats’ 
lack 
of 
real 

critique allows RBG to escape 
the 
consequences 
of 
her 

actions, or inaction, that have 
caused harm. 

On the other side of the 

aisle, let’s consider the cult 
of personality that surrounds 
Trump. The hypocrisy starts 
with more mundane things 
like his criticism of Obama 
for 
golfing 
too 
much 
— 

despite the current president 
golfing more than Obama at 
this point in his presidency. 
On a more serious note, he 
recently claimed that mail-in 
voting will lead to a “corrupt 
election” while he himself 
voted by mail in August. The 
Republican 
Party 
refuses 

to hold Trump accountable 
for the statements he makes 
that are a threat to our 
democracy. Sending federal 
agents to arrest protesters, 
as Trump did in Portland, 
Ore., is not just undemocratic, 
but, according to a Harvard 
Law School professor Noah 
Feldman, 
unconstitutional. 

But still, Trump’s supporters 
continue to defend him at all 
costs, while claiming to be 
the party of the Constitution. 
They only rebuke him on the 
most egregious of accounts, 
such as when he threatened to 
postpone the election. 

Additionally, 
idolizing 

political 
figures 
often 

pushes 
people 
to 
believe 

in 
unrealistically 
simple 

solutions 
for 
complex 

problems. Take Sanders, who is 
adored by progressives and has 
a lot of support from college 
students. Many of his proposed 
solutions as a politician are 
oversimplified, yet not met 
with proper critique from his 
supporters. 

Sanders 
fully 
supports 

Medicare for All, a single-
payer health care system. It 
sounds so easy — Medicare 
works, 
let’s 
expand 
the 

program 
to 
cover 
all 

Americans. 
But 
Sanders’s 

view ignores political reality. 
President 
Barack 
Obama’s 

health care law took two 
years 
of 
negotiation 
and 

compromise 
for 
it 
to 
be 

narrowly 
passed 
in 
2010. 

The 
Affordable 
Care 
Act 

was controversial when it 
was signed into law, and it 
remains controversial today; 
there 
have 
been 
repeal 

efforts as recently as 2017 
and the Supreme Court will 
hear 
arguments 
regarding 

the constitutionality of the 
health care law in November. 

The Affordable Care Act is 

a much more modest reform 
of health care than Medicare 
for All would be, and the 
possibility of Medicare for 
All 
becoming 
law 
seems 

politically 
remote. 
Yet 

Sanders continues to push 
for it. Realism is important 
in politics, and supporters 
of progressive ideas seem 
unable to separate the ideal 
from the realistic. The lack 
of criticism for Sanders from 
his supporters made him a 
viable candidate for president, 
despite his lack of notable 
accomplishments 
in 
the 

Senate. Sanders is a senator 
of big ideas, but he does not 
have the ability to make those 
ideas American law. Even 
congressional Democrats are 
deeply divided over Medicare 
for All. 

You 
can 
like 
political 

figures, love political figures 
or pick your favorite political 
figures. But it’s important to 
recognize that these people 
are not perfect, and we should 
not pretend that they are.

O

n Aug. 26, the United 
State’s Departments of 
State and Commerce 

announced 
a 
plethora 
of 

sanctions that are set to be 
enacted against leaders of 
construction 
companies 
— 

owned by the Communist 
Party 
of 
China 
(CPC) 
— 

which officials deemed as 
participating in malign state 
projects in the South China 
Sea. The relevant measures 
include export restrictions, 
withholding 
visas 
and 

decreased 
access 
to 
U.S.-

created technology without 
permits. 
These 
policies 

serve as an important step 
toward curtailing Beijing’s 
long-running 
problematic 

behavior.

In 2013, Chinese President 

Xi 
Jinping 
announced 

the commencement of the 
“Belt and Road Initiative,” 
a 
comprehensive 
foreign 

policy and economic strategy 
dedicated 
to 
augmenting 

Beijing’s soft and hard power 
around the globe. Since then, 
the CPC has taken on various 
projects to achieve this goal, 
with one notable example 
being the construction of 
artificial islands in the South 
China Sea. Chinese officials 
say they have rightful control 
over 
nearly 
all 
of 
these 

international 
waterways, 

yet such ambitious claims 
conflict with the policies 
of other states in the region 
who dispute the legitimacy 
of China maintaining full 
control of the sea and who may 
pass through it. The South 
China Sea serves as one of 
the most important maritime 
trade routes in the world — 
trillions of dollars worth of 
shipping pass through these 
waters each year. Having 
control over the sea does not 
merely grant symbolic power; 
it carries immense global 
economic consequences.

These islands often serve as 

fortified military installations, 
further adding to the impact 
of Beijing’s marine aggression. 
With missile systems, landing 
strips for fighter jets and other 
advanced 
equipment, 
these 

naval forts represent China’s 
ambitions to be a hegemony 
in Asia and beyond. They 
have emboldened Beijing to 
become aggressive to military 
craft that simply enters these 
international waters, including 
U.S. 
reconnaissance 
flights 

far from China’s coastline. 
These actions are not only 
threats to international law 
and established norms, but 
also toward the U.S. and the 
Southeast Asian nations whose 
coastlines 
brush 
against 

China’s “nine-dash line” that 
outlines the waters it claims on 
regional maps. 

U.S. military leaders have 

spoken strongly against these 
developments and the clear 
threat to American interests 
that they represent. In May 
2018, 
Admiral 
Philip 
S. 

Davidson, head of U.S. Indo-
Pacific 
Command, 
testified 

before 
Congress 
and 
said 

“short of war with the United 
States,” China could achieve 
full control of the South China 
Sea “in all scenarios.” If China 
achieves such a stranglehold 
on these strategically vital 
waterways, 
it 
could 
spell 

disaster for the military and 
economic interests of the U.S. 
and its allies, in Southeast Asia 
and elsewhere.

Without 
taking 
military 

action, 
the 
sanctions 

announced 
this 
week 
are 

important 
and 
potentially 

impactful 
steps 
toward 

deterring 
Chinese 
naval 

aggression. Closely targeted 
against the leadership of about 
25 state-owned construction 
firms, these restrictions can 
help to handicap any further 
development of existing or 

planned 
military 
islands 

by 
preventing 
them 
from 

attaining 
American-made 

supplies and technology for 
hostile 
Chinese 
purposes. 

The China Communications 
Construction 
Company 
and 

other CPC-funded companies 
could likely find other sources 
for materials and funding. Yet, 
the export and visa restrictions 
by the State and Commerce 
departments 
will 
certainly 

make 
Beijing’s 
work 
more 

difficult. These provisions will 
also assure that the U.S. and 
American companies do not 
inadvertently fund or support 
efforts to shift control of one 
of the world’s most important 
shipping passages toward a 
foreign adversary.

In 2015, Xi promised former 

President Barack Obama, and 
the world, that his country 
would 
not 
militarize 
the 

Spratly Islands, where the 
Chinese military had already 
begun “relevant construction” 
in areas where, in Xi’s words, 
China 
had 
maintained 

legitimate sovereignty “since 
ancient times.” Five years 
later, China added the Spratlys 
to their network of menacing 
naval installations throughout 
the South China Sea. Years 
of passivity in response to 
Beijing’s 
military 
actions 

have led Xi and his CPC to 
become further emboldened 
to expand their illegitimate 
grip 
on 
the 
international 

waterways and achieve the 
goals of their Belt and Road 
Initiative by sea. With strong 
sanctions on the way, the U.S. 
has indicated that while not 
showing aggression toward 
China, we are ready to play 
hardball to justifiably protect 
our interests and global free 
trade from Beijing’s unlawful 
attacks.

Opinion
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

T

he University of Michigan 
has 
already 
reopened 

with no plans of reversing 

course. The University has created 
a thorough reopening plan that 
is supposed to provide a safe and 
secure learning experience for all 
students. However, the plan — 
despite having good intentions 
and some good ideas — exists 
more to provide students with 
the feeling of safety rather than 
actual safety: a concept known as 
security theater. 

To 
explain 
what 
security 

theater is, how it works and 
what its purpose is, one only has 
to look at the Transportation 
Security Administration (TSA). 
Current procedures of the TSA 
have frequently been cited as 
examples of security theater, such 
as the usage of full-body scanners 
which, according to The Atlantic, 
have been shown to be ineffective 
and easily manipulated. The TSA’s 
purpose, according to the article, 
is not to provide actual security 
but rather an illusion of security 
and was put in place after the 
9/11 terrorist attacks to give 
passengers the feeling that air 
travel was safe. 

Bruce Schneier’s 2003 book, 

“Beyond Fear: Thinking Sensibly 
about Security in an Uncertain 
World,” discusses why security 
theater exists and which parties 
benefit from it. According to 
Schneier, there are players who all 
have different defining interests 
and different relationships with 
one another such as elected 
officials, corporations and the 
public. Depending on the player, 
at times they might have other 
concerns that trump security. 
He writes, “Security is partially 
a state of mind ... one of the goals 
of a security countermeasure is to 
provide people with a feeling of 
security in addition to the reality. 
But 
some 
countermeasures 

provide the feeling of security 
instead of the reality.”

In the example of the TSA, major 

airlines and elected officials’ chief 
concern was getting passengers 
back in the air and they needed to 
provide an appearance of security 
through a strict screening process 
— despite that process being 
ineffective. In a 2009 opinion 
piece written for CNN, Schneier 
noted that the best terrorist 
prevention 
is 
not 
combating 

specific plots but instead carrying 
out 
covert 
investigations, 

speaking to cultural experts and 
attacking the core ideologies that 
lead to international terrorism in 
the first place by building bridges 
with communities in the Middle 
East. However, these tactics do 
not provide the feeling of security, 
which is why the U.S.’s terrorist 
prevention strategy has morphed 
into the TSA. 

Similar to the aftermath of 9/11, 

security theater has reemerged 
in the pandemic with certain 

countermeasures being of little 
use in the fight against COVID-19. 
The pandemic, and the subsequent 
lockdown associated with it, led 
to the entire economy coming 
to a near standstill. Therefore, a 
chief concern of many businesses, 
and even the government, was 
attempting to reopen as fast as 
possible to combat the economic 
downturn. However, as states 
began to reopen, cases began 
skyrocketing and the concern 
quickly went from attempting to 
reopen to convincing the general 
public that it was safe to resume 
normal life. 

Anthony Fauci, director of 

the National Institute of Allergy 
and Infectious Diseases, has said 
that temperature checks are not 
reliable in terms of detecting 
possible cases because things 
like 
hot 
weather 
can 
cause 

readings to be inaccurately high. 
Furthermore, many businesses 
such as Planet Fitness, AMC 
Theatres and Applebee’s have 
touted 
extreme 
and 
strict 

sanitation routines despite the 
fact that the virus mainly spreads 
through person-to-person aerosol 
transmission not fomites (surfaces 
and objects). 

Similarly, 
the 
University, 

though currently pursuing actions 
that are effective, still misses the 
mark in terms of actual security. 
The University, to their credit, 
has made changes that will make 
this semester safer for students — 
for example, making 78 percent 
of credit hours remote, allowing 
many classes to be taught in a 
hybrid 
format 
and 
requiring 

all bus riders to wear masks. 
However, the reopening plan as a 
whole is still flawed.

On Aug. 12, a virtual town hall 

was held where the stated plan 
was to make the situation as safe as 
fully remote with contact tracing, 
a reserve of 600 quarantine rooms 
and outbreaks of disease being 
“anticipated.” Frequent universal 
testing was criticized by the 
administration 
as 
impractical 

during this meeting; however, 
the risks posed by proceeding 
without it were never addressed. 
University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel later revealed in an email 
that Michigan Medicine could 
only process 10,000 tests a week 
and planned to increase capacity 
as the year continued. Even 
with that lowered expectation, 
according 
to 
the 
COVID-19 

dashboard, only 1,500 tests were 
conducted during the week of 
Aug. 23. Without universal testing, 
an asymptomatic student could 
spread the disease and start an 
outbreak.

The biggest issue is that the 

University has not communicated 
its reasoning behind all of the 
measures implemented. When 
discussing testing, the University 
deemed 
frequent 
universal 

testing as impractical yet never 

explained how it was still safe to 
open without that in place. This 
is concerning since a Yale and 
Harvard University study found 
that students would need to be 
tested every two days to prevent 
an outbreak and that “symptom-
based screening alone was not 
sufficient to contain an outbreak.” 

Furthermore, 
the 

administration 
has 
given 
no 

quantitative risk assessment nor 
accounted for or explained how 
much risk is posed to the Ann 
Arbor community at large. One 
example of this behavior is that 
the administration has repeatedly 
touted that the plan was made 
with public health experts, yet 
have not explained how much risk 
will be posed to students, faculty 
and the Ann Arbor community. 
Moreover, there has been no 
adequate explanation on why the 
administration is deciding to focus 
on symptomatic students and not 
striving for universal testing when 
COVID-19 is known to spread 
asymptomatically; how residential 
advisers are expected to enforce 
the strict new guest policy when 
they can’t possibly know who 
might be an outsider; how exactly 
they plan on controlling parties 
and how effective that plan will be 
among countless other questions. 

Despite having aspects that 

are known to be effective, the 
plan as a whole ends up just 
being a theatrical display created 
to convince students it is safe 
to come back to campus. If the 
University truly believes in the 
idea of a “public health informed” 
in-person fall semester, then they 
should strive to be as open and 
transparent as possible about 
what went into their plans and 
prove to the students, faculty and 
the community that their plan 
has the least risk with the most 
benefit for all parties involved 
rather than expecting us to trust 
them and find out for ourselves. 
This is especially relevant in light 
of recent faculty protests and 
outbreaks at other schools, and 
especially if they hope to have an 
in-person semester in the winter 
term. 

The main issue with security 

theater, 
especially 
during 
a 

pandemic, is that it often takes 
away from measures that actually 
help. Applying that logic to the 
University, the proposals put in 
place and the school going hybrid, 
rather than fully remote, has 
convinced a significant number of 
students it is safe to attend when 
they may otherwise not have 
returned. That takes away from 
what has been proven to actually 
keep students, faculty and the 
community safe: a fully remote 
semester — which is a proven 
public health informed option.

A reopening more concerned with 

theatrics than safety

I

n Joe Biden and Kamala 
Harris, I see myself. I see my 
family. I see my community. I 

see my country. This may seem like 
a strange sentiment for a 20-year-
old, white, Jewish college student 
from New York to hold about a late-
septuagenarian Roman Catholic 
grandfather from Wilmington, Del., 
and a 55-year-old Black, progressive 
attorney 
and 
stepmom-of-two 

from Oakland, Calif. So, why do I 
see myself and my experiences in 
the Democratic ticket? Because 
these two leaders don’t let their 
backgrounds define their policies. 
Young voters of all races, colors and 
creeds, all ethnicities, income levels 
and hometowns have a home in their 
campaign. 

“Joe Biden isn’t good, but at least 

he’s better than Donald Trump,” is 
an argument all over social media 
in recent months, and it encourages 
people to vote for Biden simply to 
end the current administration. 
That 
argument 
is 
absurd. 
It 

generates no enthusiasm for a 
candidate who both warrants it and 
desperately needs it to combat the 
cult of personality he seeks to defeat. 
Further, it ignores many of Biden’s 
key accomplishments, particularly 
those that pertain to recent national 
conversations. 
He 
championed 

the Violence Against Women Act, 
shepherding it through the Senate 
and to President Bill Clinton’s desk. 
In the #MeToo Era, a movement 
led by young Americans, who better 
to lead our country than a man 
who’s been on the frontlines of the 
fight against domestic abuse for 30 
years? When he was vice president, 
the administration instituted a 
pandemic 
response 
apparatus 

widely considered to be a strength 
by his campaign. In the middle of a 
pandemic, he’ll have the experience 
— and the belief in science and data — 
to save lives. In a time when children 
have lost parents and grandparents 
to a preventable, unnecessarily-
political coronavirus crisis, who 
better to lift us out than Biden? 

Biden has experienced firsthand 

this kind of senseless loss, when his 
first wife and daughter were killed. 
He empathizes with the losses our 
country has felt this year and is 
uniquely qualified to console our 
nation and to heal the wounds this 
pandemic has caused us. His wife, Dr. 
Jill Biden, is a gifted and universally 
respected educator, a voice we no 

doubt need as the debate around 
how to safely educate young people 
during a pandemic becomes more 
politically charged by the minute. 
As millions of students around the 
country struggle to pay their tuition 
as incomes have been decimated 
by the pandemic, President Donald 
Trump has pushed for capital gains 
and payroll tax cuts. 

As we struggle to afford the 

education that will provide for our 
futures, Republicans have sought 
to cut benefits for those in need, 
including a radical restructuring 
of 
the 
Supplemental 
Nutrition 

Assistance Program and a strong 
scaling-back of the new virus relief 
plan. Cutting these benefits will 
impact thousands of students at 
our University of Michigan, in an 
effort to further enrich the already-
wealthy, who have thrived off of 
this crisis while so many others have 
suffered. 

Biden’s work on issues that affect 

young voters has been overlooked, 
and it stretches beyond what is plainly 
obvious. His support for paid family 
leave, Social Security reform and his 
belief in climate science, will, if he’s 
elected, have both immediate and 
lifelong impacts on our generation. 
The simplest reason why Joe Biden 
is the candidate young voters should 
support is that he cares about us, 
while Trump cares only for himself 
and his cronies. This is evident in 
their personalities, their policies and 
even their running mates. If Biden 
“isn’t good,” you’ll be hard-pressed to 
find someone who is.

The running mates in 2020 

present 
microcosms 
of 
the 

campaigns themselves, more so than 
any election in recent memory. For 
Gen Z, the choice has never been 
so stark, the right answer never 
so blatantly obvious. Biden chose 
in his running mate a breaker of 
glass ceilings. Sen. Kamala Harris, 
D-Calif., is a juggernaut for positive 
change in this country with her 
policies, such as Medicare for All, 
education and racial justice, but 
this election is about ushering in 
generational change, and that’s 
Harris’s ethos. 

Harris is a daughter of immigrants 

who grew up in Oakland, Calif. and 
attended a recently-desegregated, 
majority-white school via a busing 
program. Her mother, as Harris 
said in her convention speech, came 
to America with a dream of helping 

others — by helping cure cancer 
as a cancer researcher. Harris was 
raised in an environment where 
she had to constantly go above 
and beyond simply to receive the 
same opportunities as her whiter, 
wealthier and more well-connected 
peers. She’s not going to fight for 
tax breaks to the top one percent. 
She’s going to fight for student loan 
relief, health care for all people 
and the racial justice for which our 
generation has taken to the streets 
the last few months. 

In response to the U.S. outbreak 

of 
COVID-19 
in 
February, 
a 

Northwestern University journalism 
professor, Steven Thrasher, who 
studied Indiana’s outbreak of HIV/
AIDS in 2015 and also researched 
LGBTQ+ health issues, was quoted 
in an Associated Press article as 
saying, “Pence’s response as Indiana 
governor raises real questions about 
whether he’s the best person to helm 
the response to the virus.” Thrasher 
reflected on the time Vice President 
Mike Pence allowed an HIV/AIDS 
epidemic to ravage his home state 
while governor of Indiana. He 
refused to proactively implement 
a needle exchange program that 
would have spared thousands from 
HIV infection. Pence claims he 
staunchly believes in the right to life 
for all people, unless those people do 
intravenous drugs.

Pence doesn’t merely believe 

that LGBTQ+ people should be 
deprived of equal rights under the 
law (though that is something he 
does, categorically, believe). He has 
also espoused the idea that there is 
something wrong with them and 
even stated that “Resources should 
be directed toward those institutions 
which provide assistance to those 
seeking to change their sexual 
behavior” on his archived 2000 
congressional campaign website, 
a statement widely interpreted 
to be reflective of his support for 
conversion therapy. Additionally, 
Pence 
has 
claimed 
that 
the 

administration is deserving of 
praise for its handling of COVID-
19, to which more than 180,000 
Americans and counting have lost 
their lives.

Biden succeeded before, he will again

You’re not too old to enjoy 
Candace Flynn’s return

Take yourself back to the 

summer of 2007. Tiger Woods 
was at the height of his career. 
The first iPhone had a triumphant 
release. I went to a week of 
summer camp and returned with 
a couple hundred mosquito bites. 
And in August, Disney Channel 
previewed an animated show 
called “Phineas and Ferb.”

As 
someone 
who 
started 

watching the show early on, 
“Phineas and Ferb” was one of 
my longest-running influences. 
It ran from 2008 until 2015 and 
consisted of four seasons with 
over 30 episodes each, plus a few 
hour-long specials and a feature 
length Disney Channel film in 
2011. The show itself may have 
been set (somewhat hilariously) 
over the course of one summer, 
but for many of its watchers it was 
an entire childhood.

I watched the show consistently 

through elementary and middle 
school, always finding joy in the 
silly jokes and catchy songs. In 
2015 when I heard that the show 
was ending, I cleared my schedule 
so that I could watch the finale, 
even though I hadn’t watched 
the show in a year or two. And 
when the show went on Netflix a 
bit later, I found myself watching 
every episode — enjoying the ones 
I had missed, and rewatching the 
ones I had recorded and watched 
repeatedly in 2011 but loved all the 
same.

As I have watched “Phineas and 

Ferb” over the years, regardless of 
whether I was 10 years old or 20, 
I have always enjoyed it. I kept 
expecting myself to be “too old” 
to watch the show, and yet that 
age has never come. This is one 
of the things about “Phineas and 
Ferb” that sets it apart from most 
animated shows aimed at kids: It’s 
truly enjoyable for all ages. It’s a 
show that is brightly colored and 
silly enough to keep kids engaged, 

but also filled with jokes that hit 
differently with age. Creators Dan 
Povenmire and Jeff “Swampy” 
Marsh, along with their team 
of writers, somehow found the 
perfect comedic balance of silly 
punchlines and deep social and 
self-awareness. I have never seen 
another show master breaking the 
fourth wall in quite the same way, 
but it’s delightful every time they 
pull it off. Plus the show is rife 
with pop culture references that 
span across the decades, riffing on 
everything from ’80s pop stars to 
the “Twilight” movies. 

Of course there are also the 

songs, which are fun, endlessly 
catchy and occasionally become 
cultural phenomena — there’s 
an entire generation who knows 
exactly what an “aglet” is, and 
anyone who says they don’t know 
the words to “Gitchee Gitchee 
Goo” is probably lying. So this 
brings us to “Candace Against 
the Universe” (2020), the first 
return to “Phineas and Ferb” — 
other than the crossover episode 
in Povenmire and Marsh’s “Milo 
Murphy’s Law” — since the show 
ended.

If I’m being honest, Candace 

(Ashley Tisdale, “Scary Movie 
V”) is probably one of the least 
likable 
“Phineas 
and 
Ferb” 

characters. There’s an episode 
in “Phineas and Ferb” season 
2,“Split Personality,” where one 
of Phineas and Ferb’s creations 
split Candace into her “essence,” 
which consists of only two parts: 
her obsession with Jeremy and 
her one-track determination to 
bust her brothers.

Despite this, she isn’t entirely 

one-dimensional. 
The 
thing 

that has always struck me about 
Candace, 
especially 
as 
I’ve 

gotten older, is the way that she 
creates her own misery — she’s so 
wrapped up in her negativity and 
single-minded motivation that she 
is unable to enjoy her own life. The 
first “Phineas and Ferb” movie, 
“Across the Second Dimension,” 
is primarily focused on Phineas 

and Ferb’s relationship with Perry 
after they find out about his role 
as a secret agent; this film offers 
an intriguing chance to focus on 
Candace.

“Candace 
Against 
the 

Universe” starts with an opening 
song that does three main things: 
it reestablishes the world with 
quick reminders of some of the 
boys’ more memorable creations, 
it weaves in a series of incredibly 
clever lyrics that made me realize 
how much I had missed this show, 
and it tells us how miserable 
Candace is from her summer of 
failure. She feels overshadowed 
by her brothers when all she 
wants to do is feel special (don’t 
we all), and feels like the universe 
is acting against her (don’t we all). 
And then, somewhat suddenly, 
she gets abducted by aliens, and is 
faced with a chance to be special 
after all.

From 
some 
perspectives, 

“Candace Against the Universe” 
is a classic story: girl wants to 
feel special compared to genius 
brothers, girl gets abducted by 
aliens, brothers go to rescue girl, 
girl and brothers fight together 
against aliens and learn some 
important lessons along the way. 
The film’s plot is chaotic at times, 
but that’s the first rule of watching 
“Phineas and Ferb”: Suspend your 
disbelief, and give it the benefit of 
the doubt. The film, and the show, 
are animated for a reason and can 
mess with the rules of time and 
space within this animated world 
of infinite possibilities. 

The 
film 
is 
even 
more 

remarkable, however, when you 
realize that the majority of it was 
made in the middle of a global 
pandemic. Production continued 
even as the creative team was 
completely isolated: The cast 
recorded their lines individually 
from home, and the animation 
team coordinated between three 
different 
overseas 
animation 

studios to create the film. When 
taken in that context, “Candace 
Against the Universe” is all the 

more impressive.

What grounds the film is the 

familiarity throughout. Almost 
the entire cast was able to return: 
Tisdale as Candace, Vincent 
Martella 
(“Everybody 
Hates 

Chris”) as Phineas, Alyson Stoner 
(“Cheaper by the Dozen”) as 
Isabella, Maulik Pancholy (“30 
Rock”) as Baljeet, Povenmire as 
Dr. Doofenshmirtz, and many 
more, with David Errigo Jr. 
(“Milo Murphy’s Law”) as Ferb 
since Thomas Brodie-Sangster 
(“The Maze Runner”) was unable 
to reprise his role. There are 
the same delightful moments of 
self-awareness and fourth wall 
breaks, and the same brand of 
hilarious and toe-tappingly fun 
musical numbers. There are long 
and silly bits that are borderline 
slapstick, but there are also jokes 
requiring societal context that 
are much funnier for adults than 
kids. And all throughout there are 
references and running bits from 
the show that put a smile on the 
face of any “Phineas and Ferb” 
fan.

For many of the jokes, it’s 

impossible to tell whether it’s the 
stupidest thing ever thought of or 
the most brilliant. For example, 
a running gag centers on the 
idea that the aliens that abduct 
Candace 
occasionally 
explode 

from the waist up — and that the 
sound it makes when they explode 
sounds like “Candace.” That in and 

of itself is a lot to take in, but after 
some research I found out that the 
voice of those “Candaces” is none 
other than Tiffany Haddish. The 
fact that Tiffany Haddish is in this 
film and is actually billed as “The 
Sound Someone Makes When 
They Explode From the Waist 
Up” sent me into a three-minute 
stunned silence.

But 
balancing 
silly 
and 

ridiculous without tapping into 
flat-out stupidity is what “Phineas 
and Ferb” has always been good 
at. Things like the alien leader 
being named Super Super Big 
Doctor (Ali Wong, “Always Be 
My Maybe”) or this film hinging 
on a device called a “chicken-
replace-inator” are exactly what 
I expected, and wanted, from this 
film.

There’s 
certainly 
a 

predictability to the movie, but 
you have to remember two things: 
one, that it is technically for kids 
even if it doesn’t always feel like 
it, and two, that predictability 
is what the show operated on 
for eight years. Every episode 
of Phineas and Ferb had a 
formula: Phineas and Ferb make 
something cool, Doofenshmirtz 
makes an inator, Candace tries to 
bust her brothers, Perry defeats 
Doofenshmirtz, 
the 
inator 

inexplicably helps with cleaning 
up Phineas and Ferb’s latest 
creation, Candace fails at busting, 
they eat pie, and there’s a song 

somewhere in there. What makes 
the show unique is that, even with 
this formula, every episode feels 
different and exciting. That is 
impressive, and it’s what makes 
“Phineas and Ferb” so special.

Unfortunately, we don’t get the 

endless summer that “Phineas 
and Ferb” have been enjoying 
since 2007. School is coming back, 
in the strangest way we’ve seen 
yet, and there’s a lot happening 
in the world that needs to be 
acknowledged and paid attention 
to. Still, I enjoyed being able to 
put myself back into that endless 
summer, even if it was just for 86 
minutes of funny jokes, hilarious 
songs, heartwarming moments 
and familiar characters. It’s a 
lovely story about family — I’d be 
lying if I said the reconciliation 
between 
Candace 
and 
her 

brothers didn’t make me tear up 
a little — and it’s a return to the 
“Phineas and Ferb” that I love 
while finding ways to expand 
the world a little more. For me, 
this was the perfect movie to 
be watching in my bedroom 
in the middle of a Michigan 
thunderstorm in the middle of a 
global pandemic. Maybe it’s not, 
as Phineas might say, the Best 
Movie Ever, but it’s exactly what it 
should be. And so if anyone wants 
to know: “Aren’t you a little old to 
be watching a “Phineas and Ferb” 
movie?” Yes, yes I am. But who 
cares?

‘Sputnik’ is a familiar, yet 
moving, sci-fi thriller tale

‘Desert One’ offers glimpse 
into the Iran hostage crisis

In Russian, “Sputnik” means 

“fellow traveler.” The Soviets 
used the term for their early 
Cold War satellites, perhaps 
to give the ships a sense of 
community, or offer a friendly 
invitation to extraterrestrial 
life 
(if 
they 
happened 
to 

speak Russian). In the 2020 
film of the same name, a 
Russian spaceship picks up a 
“fellow 
traveler,” 
sometime 

in the 1980s. Sadly for the 
cosmonauts, this Sputnik is 
anything but friendly.

The 
easiest 
movie 
to 

compare 
“Sputnik” 
to 
is 

1979’s “Alien.” In both films, 
parasitic 
extraterrestrials 

prey 
on 
terrified 
humans. 

Both also have riveting female 
leads. Ellen Ripley’s “Sputnik” 
counterpart is named Tatyana 
Kilmova, played by Oksana 
Akinshina (“Quiet Comes The 
Dawn”).

Like 
Ripley 
in 
“Alien,” 

Tatyana 
bravely 
meets 

every 
horrendous 
situation 

thrown her way and puts the 
inadequate, 
cowardly 
and 

power-hungry 
men 
around 

her 
to 
shame. 
There 
are 

wounds behind her steeled 
eyes, and Akinshina’s layered 
performance makes the movie 
worth watching twice, even 
once one knows the truth 
about her character. 

“Sputnik,” 
like 
“Alien,” 

is also rooted in the sci-fi 
genre’s 
existentialist 
roots 

that trace all the way back 
to 
Shelly’s 
“Frankenstein.” 

While the aliens are scary and 
mysterious, the finely-drawn 
human characters are what 
bring viewers to the edge of 
their seats, clutching the arm 
rests with tears in their eyes. 

From the first scene, this 

film’s focus on character colors 
its science fiction elements, 
because the viewer cares about 

who they affect. Viewers don’t 
even see the creature until 
almost 30 minutes in. More 
importantly, 
in 
the 
alien’s 

single “appearance” before its 
reveal, the camera stays on the 
astronauts’ horrified reaction 
to something lurking outside 
their tiny spacecraft. As they 
tremble and stare, wide-eyed 
and slack jawed, one does not 
need to see the Sputnik to 
know that it doesn’t come in 
peace. 

When the monster is finally 

revealed, it comes with a 
twist that yanks the film 
out of “Alien’s” shadow in a 
startlingly touching fashion. 
While the twists are best left 
to the screen, one sublime 
moment is when the alien, 
laying on the floor, curls 
around a baby rattle. It was 
hard to decide whether to 
shudder or to cry. 

The creature is no computer-

generated 
plot 
device 
or 

excuse for jump scares. While 
immaculate on a technical 
level, 
it 
is 
both 
revolting 

and disgusting to watch this 
realistic parasite go about its 
slimy, predatory habits; the 
alien, like Tatyana, is also 
wrapped in thematic layers. It 
makes the characters question 
their 
lives, 
relationships 

with others and place in the 
universe. Human nature is 
explored 
through 
bloody, 

imaginative twists and turns 
right up until the credits. 

“Sputnik” 
differentiates 

itself from “Alien” (and its 
inferior sequels and imitators) 
by taking place on Earth, at a 
Soviet research center. The 
juxtaposition 
of 
the 
drab 

late-Soviet aesthetic with the 
gooey interstellar monster is 
an original, arresting palate. It 
is almost instantly clear that, 
while the alien is no ET, the 
cold industrial environment 
certainly isn’t helpful, either. 
It’s interstellar entropy versus 
the Iron Curtain.

The 
emotionless 

authoritarians 
function 

similar to how Ash did in 
“Alien,” attempting to control 
the uncontrollable alien. To 
paraphrase Ian Malcolm from 
“Jurassic Park,” they are too 
busy thinking about what they 
can do to think about what they 
should do. Thankfully, like in 
“Park,” “Alien,” “King Kong” 
and all the other great monster 
movies, these exploitative fools 
get what’s coming to them. It’s 
absolutely thrilling. 

“Sputnik” 
follows 
in 

the 
footsteps 
of 
iconic 

science fiction films while 
simultaneously 
pushing 

the 
genre 
forward. 
Even 

Ridley Scott, who directed 
the 
original 
“Alien” 
and 

returned to the series with 
2012’s 
“Prometheus” 
and 

2017’s “Alien: Covenant,” has 
never quite achieved this. It’s 
genuine, thoughtful science 
fiction that’s both escapism 
and 
an 
opportunity 
to 

contemplate humanity and its 
capacity for love and violence, 
friendship and tyranny. 

Movie theaters in Michigan 

are shuttered, the fall semester 
is already chaos and things 
just look like they’re going to 
get worse. So, fellow travelers 
through 
2020’s 
very 
real 

horrors, why not take a break 
with an unusually cute alien 
parasite, some Russians and 
a strong female lead? There 
are worse ways to spend one’s 
time. 

ANDREW WARRICK

Daily Arts Writer

In 
her 
most 
recent 

documentary, Academy-Award 
winning 
filmmaker 
Barbara 

Kopple (“Harlan County, USA”) 
takes an apolitical yet not 
impartial look at the human 
challenges of combat. “Desert 
One” is the story of a failed 
rescue mission, told by the men 
who, in the words of their British 
colleagues, “had the guts to try.” 

In 1979, when revolutionaries 

took 52 Americans hostage in 
the Tehran embassy, President 
Carter did everything he could 
to avoid taking military action. 
Kopple does a cursory job of 
setting the stage for this crisis 
but covers the main points. In 
the decades after a 1953 CIA 
coup shifted power to the Shah, 
outside voices preaching about 
a theocratic state fomented 
a revolutionary spirit among 
Iranians (particularly college 
students). The Shah’s military 
overreach 
and 
oppressive 

leadership was unwelcome, and 
the U.S. was seen as his enabler. 
Iranians wanted the Shah gone 
and would have liked the U.S. 
to go away with him. When the 
Shah was finally ousted, and 
particularly following the Shah’s 
hospitalization in New York 
City, anti-American sentiments 
grew. 

Students stormed the US 

embassy compound in Tehran 
and took scores of hostages. 
Ayatollah Khomeini, wanting 
the Shah returned to Iran so 
that justice may be exacted, 
tried to use these hostages as 
leverage. Carter was unwilling 
to extradite the Shah, and the 
days began to pass. Months 
later, 
with 
little 
movement 

regarding the hostage situation, 
Carter acquiesced to military 
action. The Pentagon’s plan was 
“simple.” The operation would 
be conducted from an airfield 
off the coast of Oman. Under 
the cover of night, a number of 
planes and helicopters would 
land in Tabas, Iran, before 
entering Tehran to extract the 
hostages. However, that’s not 
quite how it came to pass. 

I’ll leave the details of the 

bungling to Kopple, who tells the 
story better than I ever could, 
namely 
through 
interviews 

with the surviving members 
of the Special Operations team 
who landed in Tabas, Iran in 
April of 1980. We hear firsthand 
accounts of what went wrong 
and why. Visually, the story is 
told with vivid graphic-novel 
style illustrations. This film is a 
captivating tale of hope, loss and 
regret. 

Kopple’s 
interviewees 

represent an impressive variety 
of 
perspectives 
(hostages, 

soldiers, 
decision 
makers, 

bystanders, etc.) from both the 
Iranian and American sides 
of this crisis. These diverse 
perspectives 
tend 
to 
share 

one 
common 
denominator: 

emotionality. 
The 
personal 

tolls taken by this endeavor 
are presented in such a way as 
to supersede the political and 
tactical. 

Consequently, the truth is 

watered down. Kopple’s focus 
on the men “in the room” 
comes at the cost of any account 
of 
historical 
and 
cultural 

circumstance. 
Further, 
by 

failing to properly represent the 
intricate and nuanced cultural 
politics of the 1979 Iranian 
Revolution, America is portrayed 
as a victim. Any student of 
history will know that this is 
rarely the case. American greed 
for oil, the motivation for much 
of our meddling in this region, 
was of course omitted from this 
story. That the American troops 
took hostages (albeit for less 
than 24 hours) in the process of 
rescuing hostages, is mentioned 
but glossed over. Instead, we see 
video of American flags burned 
and American corpses defiled. 
Oh, and do beware, the viewer is 
given no warning before images 
of charred, naked bodies, frozen 
in infinite agony appear on 
screen.

Why I’m reading Stephen 
King during the pandemic

Over the last six months, 

I 
have 
(understandably) 

turned to reading books that 
comfort me. I reread the first 
“Harry Potter” book out loud 
to my six-year-old neighbor; 
I 
revisited 
the 
meditative 

poetry of Walt Whitman and 
the remarkable prose of Tom 
Robbins. The words that I 
had read time and time again 
consoled me while everything 
else seemed impossibly crazy. 
More and more, though, I 
began to return to the genre 
that my friends think I’m 
insane for craving when I need 

a night alone, curled up in bed: 
horror.

Part of horror’s intrigue 

is 
the 
ability 
of 
talented 

horror writers to pinpoint the 
aspects of society or our own 
subconscious that bother or 
scare us, and turn them into 
something tangible. Effective 
horror unlocks fears we do 
not even realize we have, or 
personifies it in a way that 
makes 
it 
simultaneously 

fantastical yet much more 
real. Horror movies get a lot of 
attention in the media: horror 
books, 
less 
so. 
However, 

horror books, when done well, 
are infinitely more terrifying 
than 
horror 
movies. 
They 

force the reader to create the 

thing they fear in their own 
mind. Every reader creates a 
different universe from the 
words provided by the horror 
book, no matter how specific 
the author’s description is. 
In other kinds of books, this 
can be beautiful; the love 
interest resembles the person 
we love, and the houses of 
characters look like the homes 
of childhood friends, tucked 
away in a corner of the brain 
until a book unlocks it. But 
when a book requires us to 
create something we fear, we 
do the same thing — we draw 
from our own life to create a 
parallel yet imaginary world. 
We have to create something 
uniquely terrifying to us. It

Another slightly tone deaf 
real estate show premieres

‘Chemical Hearts,’ full of 
cliches, is unwatchable

The Hamptons: where your 

richest friends go on summer 
vacation. But reality TV’s focus this 
time is on realtor JB Andreassi’s 
opportunity to sell his first million-
dollar real estate property. His 
listing at 21 Kellis Way, marked 
at nearly $7 million and a two 
minute drive from the shore, 
includes eight bedrooms and eight 
and half bathrooms. The house, 
unsurprisingly, is the primary 
focus of our quick entry into the 
world of luxury real estate in 
“Million Dollar Beach House.” JB’s 
mentor, the property 
mogul James, reminds 
him to say that the 
house is two acres 
instead 
of 
7,000 

square feet. In the 
face of mountainous 
stress, JB admits that 
he prefers this new 
line of work in The 
Hamptons over the rat 
race of New York City. 
He professes he’s a 
“rookie” again, looking 
to make an impact on 
the far reaches of Long 
Island.

Despite his humble 

nature, 
the 
beach 

homes that JB and 
his 
team 
peddle 

are way beyond the 
normal margins of 
commission for any 
amateur housing rep, 
and far above any median income 
level. It’s the type of attention to 
the stress of wealth that constantly 
draws our eyes into the theatrics of 
reality television. 

In the COVID-19 economy, 

where so many Americans face 
the threat of imminent evictions, 
Netflix’s sudden premiere of a 
reality show featuring elegant 
mansions occupied by carefree 
yuppies could easily be viewed 
as 
somewhat 
tone-deaf. 
Still, 

as a son of two architects, I am 
captivated by the allure of houses 
as more than simply somewhere 
to sleep. As a grandchild of two 
native New Yorkers, I am deeply 
in love with the sight and smell of 
the Long Island shores. I just wish 
these homes were going to more 
wholesome people.

The Hamptons branch of Nest 

Seekers International currently 

has around 125 employees listed 
on its company website. “Million 
Dollar Beach House” focuses 
on five Nest Seekers brokers: 
JB Andreassi, James Giugliano, 
Michael Fulfree, Peggy Zabakolas, 
and Noel Roberts. Similar to 
“Selling Sunset,” the series reveals 
the 
day-to-day 
routines 
and 

SNAFUs of working in luxury real 
estate

“You can’t do this part-time 

and watch your kids,” Giugliano 
says amidst the foreground of a 
monochrome white living room. 
“It’s impossible to make money 
unless you’re all in.” In order to 
make $2.5 million in commission 
every year, he claims you’ll need to 

eat, sleep and breathe the game of 
home buying. But the game itself 
is relatively easy to play if you can 
afford the buy-in. Eighty percent 
of all homes within the Hamptons 
are secondary properties, meaning 
that most of the surrounding 
hamlets are purely for vacation 
purposes. 

Nest 
Seekers 
International, 

the real estate group featured in 
“Million Dollar Beach House,” 
is in a more comfortable position 
than the other 2,500 realtors 
on the eastern-most tip of Long 
Island. The small confines of the 
Hamptons allow Nest Seekers 
to deal exclusively in the sale of 
ultra-luxury, multi-million-dollar 
homes. Memorial Day to Labor 
Day is known in the area as “selling 
season,” where the fast-paced 
nature of the luxury home market 
eats at the pockets of the ultra-rich 

and feeds our well-groomed team 
of real estate professionals.

Surprisingly, what separates 

these homes from most others 
within the sphere of reality 
television is the genuine style and 
artistry of the architecture. These 
houses, for the most part, are not 
the gaudy kind you’d typically 
see from “Keeping Up with the 
Kardashians” or “Chrisley Knows 
Best.” 
Additionally, 
the 
Nest 

Seekers team shares personal 
anecdotes about how they want 
their lives to be changed by selling 
these homes. Michael, JB’s lifelong 
friend, announces his plans of 
becoming a father. Peggy, the only 
woman on the team, is looking 

to 
prove 
herself 

after 
dominating 

the 
Manhattan 

markets. 
JB 

compares 
his 

worries 
about 

becoming 
a 

successful 
broker 

to his trials as a 
football player at 
Dartmouth.

Maybe the most 

significant moment, 
though, 
belongs 

to Noel, the only 
Black 
person 
on 

the Nest Seekers 
team. 
The 
show 

quickly glosses over 
his 
appreciation 

for The Hampton’s 
geographic beauty 
and instead cuts 
strangely 
to 
his 

coworker Micheal. 

“Have you seen him yet? Noel? 
Noel? — whatever the f***?” he 
laughs. “Very polished, right?” This 
strange cutaway seems to trivialize 
the presence of Noel within the 
brokerage. Later, when newcomer 
Peggy accompanies Noel to a 
home-buying pitch later in the 
episode, she scolds his intelligence 
behind the scenes after he proposes 
a whopping $35 million in order to 
convince the homeowner to sell.

For 
all 
its 
entrepreneurial 

glam and attention to detail, Nest 
Seekers seems to be obsessed 
with drawing in young, wall 
street bachelors as their clientele. 
“Million Dollar Beach House” 
comes across like a fever-dream of 
clout chasing. The luxury homes 
showcased present unhealthily 
high expectations of living for even 
the most carnivorous NYU Stern 
alumnus. 

MAXWELL BARNES

holds a mirror up to our fears, 
namely the darkest ones that 
we prefer to hide away. 

If 
horror 
unlocks 
and 

personifies 
our 

deepest fears, then 
why would anyone 
read horror? This 
is, 
of 
course, 
a 

question I have been 
asked many times. 
Why do I choose 
to 
watch 
horror 

movies alone? Why 
do I read so much 
Stephen King? Don’t 
I get nightmares? 
Unlike a night spent 
ruminating 
over 

both irrational and 
rational 
terrors, 

a 
horror 
book 

is 
expected 
and 

contained. 
The 

images may linger, 
but the story ends. 
There is always a 
final page, a point 
at which we can 
definitively 
put 

the 
book 
down. 

Real-life fear does 
not work like that 
— 
it’s 
incredibly 

(and 
terrifyingly) 

open-ended. Especially in the 
COVID era, fear surrounds us. 
For the vast majority of the 
population, the various ways 
one could get hurt or killed 
doing 
everyday 
activities 

never cross the mind. Now, 
of course, it is imperative 
that we think “fearfully” in 
order to protect ourselves and 
others. Every time we leave 
our “bubbles” and venture out 
into the world, that fear (for 
most) comes to the forefront 
of the mind. Horror does not 
create terror, necessarily; it 
consolidates it. Horror novels 
allow us to set aside time 
and space to be scared, and 

to let out all the vague daily 
anxiety we have. It packages 
fear between two covers, thus 
allowing the reader to set their 

fears to rest. 

For example, I consistently 

return to one of my favorite 
short stories by Stephen King, 
taken 
from 
his 
collection 

of short stories Four Past 
Midnight, 
called 
“The 

Langoliers.” This is a story 
I read when I know I am 
a long way away from my 
next flight on an airplane, 
because 
it 
addresses 
the 

tiny, nagging question that a 
master of horror like King is 
able to pinpoint: What would 
happen if you woke up on an 
airplane and nearly everyone 
was gone? In a larger and 
more metaphorical sense, it 

reminds us of the control that 
we surrender each time we get 
on an airplane. This resonates 
now especially since air travel 

contributed 
so 

heavily 
to 
the 

spread 
of 
the 

coronavirus. The 
pandemic 
adds 

yet another level 
of surrender to 
the experience of 
flying. King could 
not have foreseen 
the effects of 9/11 
or 
the 
COVID-

19 pandemic on 
air 
travel 
back 

in 
1990 
when 

the 
collection 

was 
originally 

published, but he 
understood 
the 

basic 
underlying 

fear. In the story, 
the 
characters 

look 
out 
the 

window 
to 
see 

their world being 
eaten 
alive 

by 
darkness. 

This was never 
something I was 
afraid of before 
reading 
“The 

Langoliers,” but the image 
has stuck with me because 
it turned an abstract fear 
into a concrete image in my 
mind. It is therefore easier to 
compartmentalize that fear. It 
focuses it on a specific image. 
King said it best himself, when 
asked by NPR in an interview 
about fear in the pandemic: 
“It’s not panic. It’s not terror 
that I feel, that I think most 
people feel, it’s a kind of 
gnawing anxiety.” Horror is 
a break from the “gnawing 
anxiety,” while still feeding it 
the fear it needs to be satiated.

But when a book 

requires us to 

create something 
we fear, we do the 
same thing — we 

draw from our 

own life to create 

a parallel yet 

imaginary world. 
We have to create 

a parallel yet 

imaginary world.

If there were ever a perfect 

movie to describe the trajectory 
of 2020, it would be “Chemical 
Hearts.” Much like this year, 
every time you think that this 
movie can’t get any worse, it does. 

There isn’t any one thing 

that makes “Chemical Hearts” 
difficult 
to 
watch. 
Rather, 

every individual flaw of the 
film builds on each of the 
others, creating a beautiful 
disaster. It starts with the 
premise: an overused, well-
known story that everyone has 
seen. Henry (Austin Abrams, 
“Paper Towns”) meets Grace 
(Lili 
Reinhart, 
“Riverdale”) 

who is jaded and cynical and 
has a past. He quickly falls 
for her and wants to be with 
her. She doesn’t want that, or 
maybe she does. Nobody really 
knows.

The story of their love 

begins with a montage and 
happens too quickly for it to 
be realistic. At the same time, 
it 
happens 
slowly 
because 

neither of them are ready to 
be with each other. Nothing 
about the film is unique or 
special. While imperfections 
can sometimes make things 
better, that’s not the case here. 
The imperfections of the movie 
are obvious and right in your 
face. They hit you at the very 
beginning and continue as the 
film plays out. 

Hearing 
“you 
are 
never 

more alive than when you are a 
teenager” in the very first line 
of the film had me rolling my 
eyes and physically cringing, 
because as someone who is a 
teenager, I’m pretty sure that’s 

false. The whole point of life is 
to find reasons to be alive, to 
find reasons to be happy and 
joyful, and if you peak when 
you’re a teenager, then what 
kind of life have you lived? 

That’s the way the entire 

movie feels. Like it tries too 
hard 
to 
mean 
something 

that it could never mean. 
The 
characters 
are 
two-

dimensional at best, the story 
is predictable and flat and the 
meaning is contrived. 

The very first day he meets 

her, Henry falls in love with 
Grace, a girl who was injured 
in a car accident. But Grace 
doesn’t want to love him, or 
feels like she can’t, because her 
boyfriend died in the accident. 
And Henry, who partakes in 
the Japanese art form Kintsugi, 
which 
involves 
mending 

broken pottery with seams of 
gold, wants nothing more than 
to make her happy, to fix her. 
That isn’t exactly what makes a 
healthy relationship.

Another strange thing about 

the movie, perhaps the most 
unsettling thing of all, is its 
relationship with death. From 
Grace’s boyfriend’s accident to 
the high school newspaper’s 
theme, death, and especially 
suicide, are annoyingly and 
inorganically prevalent in this 
movie. The film doesn’t glorify 
death, per se, but it comes close. 
Teen 
movies 
have 
featured 

death a lot more than necessary 
in recent history, but for some 
reason, it seems much more 
obvious in this film than in 
others, and not in a good way.

I’ve seen tons of films like 

this: 
cheesy, 
teenage 
love 

stories that are all unrealistic 
and all nearly clones of one 
another. And frankly, I was 

hoping that the trend of making 
those films was coming to an 
end. It’s not something that 
we need anymore, and in all 
honesty, teens deserve movies 
that portray them in a better 
light. Not all teens are overly 
dramatic like they often seem 
in teen films. Teenagers should 
feel a connection to the people 
that are meant to represent 
them on screen.

One aspect of the film that is 

potentially the root of its many 
problems is the issue with the 
film’s perspective. As is the 
case with so many of these 
similar teen movies, the story 
and perspective mostly follow 
the male protagonist, Henry, in 
this case. While I’m sure this is 
done to keep a sense of mystery 
that typically surrounds the 
girl’s character, it tends to 
seem wrong. Grace is without 
a doubt the more “interesting” 
character in the film because 
of her past and the issues that 
she is working through. To 
have the film follow her would 
be much more interesting and 
unique. However, “Chemical 
Hearts” does what so many 
other John Green-type films 
do, in having the film follow 
Henry, the “observer” who 
falls for the “different girl.”

Bad 
movies 
can 
be 

entertaining for the sake of 
making fun of them, but there 
are different levels of bad 
movies. There are some that 
are enjoyable to watch because 
they’ll make you laugh in 
shocked disbelief that such a 
film exists, and there are some 
where you sit in silence waiting 
for them to be over. “Chemical 
Hearts” is the latter.

Lana Del Rey ventures 
into spoken word poetry

In between the transition of 

tracks one and two, I fire off three 
successive texts: 

“Holy f#$%ing sh$t.
Nothing has ever wreaked 

havoc on my soul like this single 
track has done.

I am CRYING.” 
My friend responds with the 

picture of a small child who 
appears to embody the world-
weary disgruntlement of a man 
amid a mid-life crisis:

“Lana 
always 
chooses 

emotional violence.” 

Does that make me a masochist, 

then, for loving every blow of Lana 
Del Rey’s spoken word poetry, 
Violet Bent Backwards Over 
The Grass? Perhaps. Suffice 
it to say, the audiobook 
format 
is 
emotionally 

eviscerating in the hands 
of Del Rey. Her voice, with 
the 
trademark 
siren’s-

call edge, adds a layer of 
intimacy that ink and 
paper can’t quite capture. 
That, combined with the 
background 
music 
and 

evocative writing, makes 
for an experience like none 
other. 

The 
Violet 
Bent 

Backwards Over The Grass 
audiobook, released July 
28, 2020, features just 
14 poems read aloud by 
Del Rey. The hardcover 
release, coming at the end of 
this month, will feature over 
30 original poems and original 
photography from Del Rey. Her 
first release since 2019’s Norman 
Fucking Rockwell album, Violet 
Bent Backwards Over The Grass 
is distinct in both its audiobook 
format and intense vulnerability. 

I walked into Violet Bent 

Backwards with the assumption 
that I knew what to expect; 
my mind still hasn’t walked 
out. Physically, I am here in my 
apartment — mentally? I’m in San 
Francisco Bay. 

It is to the Bay that Del Rey 

takes us first: “I left my city for 

San Francisco.” Track one eases 
us in, like a graceful dip into 
water. The sounds of passing cars 
and lapping waves makes the 
California Dreamin’ feel all too 
real. Where the words provide 
the emotional ammunition, the 
addition of background music 
sets the scene. It’s as if Del Rey 
is weaving together a new world 
piece by piece. The sounds give 
way to the sights; they act as a 
thread of connection between 
poems, and a buffer between the 
raw, unedited moments that Del 
Rey brings forth. 

Much like an album, the 

audiobook format provides for 
an 
uninterrupted 
experience, 

transitioning smoothly between 
tracks. Poems, like songs, are 
curated and structured with 

intent; short, brighter poems 
provide reprieve from heavier, 
soul-searching 
expositions. 

Del Rey, while still artistic and 
vulnerable in her music, breaks a 
new wall — heck, a new dimension 
— with her spoken-word poems. 
Words, and often silence, hang 
heavier. There is no chorus to fall 
back on, the only option is to move 
forward. 

But rather than an ode to 

SanFran, track one is penned as 
a letter to home. “L.A. I’m from 
nowhere, who am I to love you? 
L.A. I’ve got nothing, who am I 
to love you when I’m feeling this 
way and I’ve got nothing to offer.” 

Filled with longing, Del Rey writes 
of the tempestuous relationship 
between ourselves and the places 
we call home.

Beneath the beauty of Del Rey’s 

written verse, there lies the steady 
melody of life (and notes) passing 
by all too quickly. With adoration, 
longing and conflict, Del Rey 
pleads to L.A. as a child might 
plead to a parent for love and 
understanding. “Home” becomes 
both a place of safety and refuge, 
as well as a space of oppression 
and painful experience. Track one 
speaks to how our origins mold us 
— sometimes too harshly. 

Del Rey repeats, “Can I come 

home now?” This question rings 
out, a yearning for a return to 
the familiar, whether that be the 
comfort of home or the ugliness we 

know best. As she pleads 
permission, 
a 
harder 

confrontation 
arises 
— 

would our “home” take us 
back? Del Rey ends with 
a somber promise, “I’m 
yours if you’ll have me, but 
regardless, you’re mine.” 
Here, Del Rey asserts her 
connection to her home, 
her beautiful and cruel 
L.A., yet perhaps a more 
striking statement exists 
beneath: 
the 
claiming 

of herself fearlessly and 
without doubt.

Del Rey speaks to this 

dynamic 
of 
childhood, 

of L.A. as an equally 
nurturing and neglectful 
“parent,” and in turn 

she edges into a motherly role. 
Audiobooks recall the beginning 
and end of life. Some of our earliest 
memories are of parental figures 
reading aloud to us. In turn, as our 
bones grow old and eyes dull, we 
return to audiobooks for ease, and 
perhaps comfort, too. Her poems 
tell stories of her life. In this, Del 
Rey appears as a mother to us all, 
loving us where L.A. — or any 
other home — did not. 

As a New Yorker with deep East 

Coast loyalty, even I found myself 
longing for the “Eucalyptus trees” 
and mountains of the West Coast. 
Del Rey’s true talent isn’t merely 
good writing or her creative 

format, but rather her ability to 
captivate your mind and make 
you see things through her eyes. 
From start to end, there was no 
distinction between my own 
feelings and those of Del Rey. Her 
voice, hypnotic and powerful, 
crafts a space undisturbed by time 
or conflict. 

I still struggle to articulate why 

exactly Violet Bent Backwards 
Over 
The 
Grass 
feels 
more 

encompassing than the traditional 
album — be it a Lana Del Rey 
classic, or anyone else. Every track 
is untitled, save for its identifying 
number. Unlike with songs, where 
the title often provides a hint of 
things to come, Del Rey’s poems 
remain small mysteries. Songs can 
be hypnotizing in their repetition, 
and there is a natural short-
term gratification system built 
into traditional song structure: 
Listeners are rewarded with fun, 
melodic chorus for every verse 
they wade through. Spoken-word 
poetry, when done right, is like a 
hand reaching into your mind. If 
not for the steady lull of comfort, 
Del Rey could easily be part of a 
classic sci-fi brainwashing scene. 
The West Coast is better than the 
East Coast, L.A. is cooler than 
New York. I shudder to imagine 
such a reality. 

From 
the 
Audiobook 

format, there is an underlying 
apprehension to this lack of control 
that I instinctively shy away from. 
There is no page to turn. There is 
no helpful Spotify sidebar that lets 
me know how popular each song 
is. There are no titles to clue me in 

on what to think, or how to feel. 
The end result is a deep dive into 
an alternate reality. I imagine this 
is what pulling on a VR headset 
feels like: alarming, deceptive and 
addictive. 

In fact, the experience of 

listening to Violet Bent Backwards 
Over The Grass is wholly divorced 
from her music. Only track one 
has been released by Del Rey on 
Spotify; to listen to her poems, I 
was banished from the comfort 
of my musical “home” to the dark 
depths of the iPhone Books app 
(which I had to re-download). To 
be sure, Del Rey’s poetry is by no 
means a musical Trojan horse. It 
does, however, provide a tentative 
bridge 
between 
her 
musical 

audiences and the anticipation 
of hardcover release — a Big Girl 
serving of poems sans music. 

The entirety of Violet Bent 

Backwards Over The Grass is, 
admittedly, dramatic. Even as 
I write praise, I recognize the 
unavoidable glamor and glitz — 
the “L.A” of it all. But isn’t that 
why we love Lana Del Rey? If 
it were not for the emotional 
poignancy of Del Rey’s voice, her 
poems may appear self-serving 
and pretentious. I’m left with the 
suspicion that no one else would 
ever be able to pull this off half as 
well. 

Track two filters Del Rey’s 

voice with the static of an old 
recording or scuffed vinyl disc. 
Jazzy saxophone riffs weave in 
between verse and stanza. We are 
left to rest on the shores of Vintage 
Beach, Nostalgia, U.S.A. As this 

sensory journey continues, her 
poems grow more dreamlike. The 
dam-break of the first two tracks 
give way to an interlude of shorter 
poems, as if Del Rey is taking a 
breath of air. At one point, I grew 
so lost in Del Rey’s soft-spoken 
words that I forget where — and 
when — I was. My trance ended to 
the final beat of track four, where 
Del Rey whispered “You don’t 
want to be forgotten, you just 
want to disappear.” 

Violet Bent Backwards Over The 

Grass is a little psychedelic, too. 
For some, the lack of steadying 
audio structure (the anchor of 
the verse and chorus) may be too 
distracting. As enjoyable as Lana’s 
spoken word poetry is, it is not 
interchangeable with her songs. 
Her poems are an experience. 
They’re a character study of a 
woman who perhaps seems as 
intimately close as a friend, and 
then as distant as the moon. 

As such, Violet Bent Backwards 

Over The Grass is a fantastic 
adventure 
into 
something 

strange, something new. For 
the 
poetry-wary, 
Del 
Rey 

strikes a comfortable balance 
between storytelling (moments 
and lessons from her life) and 
thematic, exploratory poems that 
are begging to be picked apart 
word by word. It’s perfect for a 
cloudy day, curled up in a quiet 
room, or the background track to 
some gritty, old-fashioned self-
reflection. For writers and artists 
like myself, it’s like a straight IV of 
creative inspiration threaded into 
a pulsating vein.

Bent Backwards Over 

The Grass’?

‘Freaks’ is fun, even if it 
doesn’t have much to add

‘Vow’ makes you wait for it

Even 
in 
a 
post-Marvel 

Cinematic Universe world, there 
is always going to be a desire to 
make movies about superheroes. 
There’s so much potential in 
them: the coming-of-age aspect, 
the tensions between the “real” 
world and the supernatural, the 
government censorship and more. 
The problem is that, when 
there have been hundreds of 
superhero films made in the 
last 50 years, it’s difficult to 
make something truly new. 
“Freaks: You’re One of Us,” 
a German superhero film 
that dropped on Netflix last 
week, does its best — with a 
result that is entertaining, if 
not quite unique.

The film centers around 

Wendy (Cornelia Gröschel, 
“Heidi”), a woman in her 
late 20s working as a fry 
cook to support her family. 
Her husband Lars (Frederic 
Linkemann, “Die verlorene 
Tochter”) and son Karl 
(Finnlay 
Berger, 
“Der 

Geburtstag”) are kind and sweet, 
and the three of them are a great 
family even when they struggle 
with money. Still, her job as a fry 
cook is less than ideal: She gets paid 
little money and can’t work up the 
courage to ask for a raise.

But, as is always the case, there 

is more to the story. An opening 
scene featuring an ominous view of 
an elementary school with a gaping 
hole in the wall and a sobbing 
young Wendy gives us the clues 
we need: Wendy is gifted with 
superpowers. Still, the incident as 
a child has led her to repress those 
memories, and a special daily pill, 
prescribed from somewhere in 
the government, physiologically 
represses her powers. As a result, 
she has no idea what she’s capable 

of.

So when Marek (Wotan Wilke 

Möhring, “Who Am I”), a strange 
man with apparent invincibility, 
tells her to skip her pills, she 
discovers that she has super-
strength. There are people with 
powers hidden throughout her 
society — even her somewhat 
goofy 
coworker 
Elmar 
(Tim 

Oliver Schultz, “The Red Band 
Society”) is gifted with power over 
electricity. Wendy’s powers lead 

to a transformation beyond the 
ability to bend metal trays in half: 
She becomes more assertive about 
taking what she wants, but also 
starts becoming more reckless.

This film has a lot of promise 

in terms of creating something 
new. One of the biggest things 
that sets Wendy apart from other 
superheroes is that her life is 
already established before the 
inciting event. Many superhero 
movies are about loners; Wendy, 
on the other hand, has her family 
unit, which only makes the stakes 
all the more intense. Because of 
this, “Freaks” explores interesting 
tensions surrounding power and 
family.

The movie also dares to pose 

the question: does the presence of 

people with superpowers mean 
that there’s a need for superheroes? 
Elmar — whose obsession with 
comic books greatly influences 
his understanding of his powers 
— views superheroes in a very 
idealistic way; Marek, on the other 
hand, takes a more pragmatic 
approach. Over the course of the 
film, Wendy must decide which 
approach she wants to live her life 
by.

In the end, the shortfalls of 

“Freaks” 
come 
from 

underdeveloped 
worldbuilding. 
You 

meet a few people with 
various 
superpowers, 

but the majority of the 
superheroes are extras 
in the background that 
you never get to meet. 
Wendy’s 
“psychiatrist” 

Dr. 
Stern 
(Nina 

Kunzendorf, “Phoenix”) 
serves as the face of the 
institutions 
keeping 

superheroes hidden — yet 
we get little information 
about these institutions 
beyond the basic goals. 
Much of the film is 
predictable, filled with 

moments that come off as cliché — 
possibly a result of translation from 
German, but most likely because of 
the somewhat formulaic plot.

“Freaks” does well enough for 

what it is: a superhero movie with 
an 
unconventional 
protagonist 

and a conventional plot. Within 
somewhat fluid pacing, there 
are enough amusing moments 
and cool visual effects to keep 
an audience entertained — not 
to mention a chance to watch 
Wendy absolutely thrash a group 
of catcalling creeps. “Freaks” is a 
very solid international film about 
power and responsibility, playing 
under a solid ’80s soundtrack 
from Wendy’s sticker-covered CD 
player. I just wish that it was a little 
less predictable.

and 

bureaucratic 
exposition. 

Before NXIVM was known 
worldwide as a hive of abuse 
and exploitation, it was a self-
help seminar series.

Founded in 1998, NXIVM 

began as a vaguely science-
based multi-level marketing 
scheme. Leaders Keith Raniere 
and Nancy Salzman promoted 
the organization as a way to 
optimize a person’s potential 
by 
eliminating 
“limiting 

beliefs” that stand in the way of 

his or her success. Edmondson 
and Vincente recount the rapid 
growth of the semi-spiritual 
group from hotel ballroom 
Powerpoint presentations to a 
business conglomerate backed 
by the two heirs to the Seagram 
beverage fortune.

As the premiere unfolds, 

the 
average 
viewer 
might 

start to question why exactly 
a 
primetime 
HBO 
series 

has spent the last half hour 
talking about colored sashes 
and personal questionnaires. 
Slowly, a sense of unease creeps 
into each tearful interview as 
the audience wonders, “How 
did 
a 
self-esteem 
building 

method 
become 
a 
waking 

nightmare?” But “The Vow” 
offers 
no 
answers 
in 
its 

enigmatic debut. 

If you didn’t know anything 

about NXIVM before watching 
this, you’d still have no idea 
what the point of “The Vow” 
is after the first episode. In 
fact, the show’s entire feeling 
of suspense relies on viewers 
already knowing the story 
that’s about to be told. Its 
foreshadowing is vague, almost 
nonexistent. But is that pacing 
problem an issue with “The 
Vow” or with its audience?

When 
a 
documentary 

premieres about events that 
occurred not even a few years 
prior, a certain amount of 

background is assumed. When 
a 
documentary 
premieres 

about events as heinous as 
the sexual abuse of NXIVM, 
a certain amount of morbid 
fascination is assumed. Often 
works of the true-crime genre 
cash in on disturbing content 
to keep audiences interested. 
HBO, however, has taken a 
subtler approach to capture 
attention. 

Before it exposes each of 

Keith Raniere and NXIVM’s 
crimes, 
“The 
Vow” 
wants 

to 
show 
exactly 
how 
a 

seemingly 
innocent 
(and 

convoluted) self-help course 
became 
international 
news. 

In outlining every step of the 
organization’s 
creation 
and 

belief system, the documentary 
thus far avoids addressing 
the twisted horror story that 
dedicated 
true-crime 
fans 

already know and came to see. 

It’s hard to make a judgement 

on “The Vow” because the 
show itself is saving its most 
powerful moments for the 
final episodes. The choice to 
bury the lede may have been 
in order to bait viewers into 
watching past episode one or to 
attempt to explain how exactly 
someone falls victim to a cult. 
Whatever the motivation, the 
story of NXIVM and its victims 
is waiting to be told, just as its 
audience is waiting to hear it.

M

y mother has always told me 

I’m allowed to be an English 

major, but I’m not allowed to 

become a teacher. As a senior studying cre-

ative writing and literature, I haven’t strayed 

far from the world I grew up in — one where 

education was a daily topic of discussion. 

My mother is a public high school English 

teacher whose biggest project is a class called 

College Writing, which she created over a 

ten-year span with peers and mentors. I grew 

up fully immersed in her academic career. I 

graded her students’ quizzes at swim meets, 

sprawled on the concrete and wrapped in 

the thick chlorinated air, oblivious to the ex-

citement around me. (I later found out they 

were Scantrons and that I was a gullible, ea-

ger twelve-year-old). I rode in the passenger 

seat while my older brother drove to an after 

school test, quizzing him on research acro-

nyms and grammar intricacies. I took College 

Writing my junior year of high school, finally 

writing poetry and digital stories like the “big 

kids” I’d watched growing up — though after 

a year in my mother’s classroom for fresh-

man year English, we decided another teach-

er might be best for me. 

After I finished College Writing, my moth-

er would tape notes to her students’ portfo-

lios strewn around our kitchen counter. Not 

sure about this one. Thoughts? We’d typical-

ly differ half a letter grade, with an A- from 

her and a B+ from me. During my first few 

years of college, I brought home textbooks 

littered with sticky notes, emailed her essay 

drafts hours before they were due and called 

at odd hours when I couldn’t remember spe-

cific words. 

I grew up listening, and then participat-

ing, in discussions of curriculum, standard-

ized testing, racism and discrimination, 

keeping digital projects relevant and even-

tually remote teaching frustrations, among 

many others. 

But I grew up into a world that replaced 

those conversations with ones of worry for 

everyone’s safety, from school shootings to a 

pandemic, into a world that let outside prob-

lems fester and swell and force their way into 

brick-walled classrooms, trapped with no 

place to go. And our educators bear the brunt 

of it. 
O

f course, safety and education 

have always been complemen-

tary. Educators are responsible 

for a group of human beings, after all — a 

duty that comes with inherent uncertain-

ties. American teachers, in particular, ac-

cept daunting truths that may appear foreign 

to other professions, such as the reality of 

school shootings and their role as protectors. 

But 2020 brings new challenges: Teacher 

safety is not only jeopardized by a small pos-

sibility of unpredictable danger, but instead 

by the very unknowns schools are swinging 

open their doors to. 

Six months after COVID-19 was first re-

ported in the United States, I watch on Face-

book as my former math teacher posts photos 

of the plexiglass shield her husband con-

structed for her desk. In some classrooms, 

the desks are as little as 23 inches apart. 

Across the country, teachers with serious 

pre-existing conditions are writing wills and 

calculating loss of income if they choose not 

to go back. And just like that, with schools 

reopening, we’ve successfully crammed an-

other problem into a classroom that didn’t 

ask for it. 

“I’m not asking for a zero risk. I know 

there’s risk in my job,” my mother said in a 

phone interview that was as formal as you 

can get with a parent. “There’s risk in my job 

every day with school shooters. But I’m ask-

ing to be treated respectfully and humanely.”

Respectfully and humanely by whom? By 

administrations, who are tasked with open-

ing schools at the objection of their teachers. 

By parents, who only want their kids back 

in school. And by college students, some of 

whom still spend their free time attending 

bars and parties. 

Kentaro Toyama, a professor in the School 

of Information, feels the same as it applies to 

in-person classes on college campuses. “I feel 

reasonably confident as long as I take mod-

erate measures in terms of social distanc-

ing and wearing masks and the students do 

too,” Toyama said. “But I’m also completely 

sympathetic with many of my colleagues 

who are either older or have various health 

conditions for whom this is potentially life 

or death — you meet with the wrong student 

for just a little bit too long and it could mean 

coronavirus.” 

Dennis Mihalsky is a high school English, 

Journalism, and Speech and Debate teacher 

at the City College Academy of the Arts in 

New York City, who had a different opinion 

on meeting students face-to-face. “For my 

own boundaries, I am pretty nervous and 

hesitant,” he said. “I’m going to go in (to 

school) but I will be very cautious of every-

thing that I do, follow as many of the proce-

dures as possible and get my students to as 

well.”

My mother, who now hates the word “fea-

sible”, mentions that her school has tossed 

the Center for Disease Control and Preven-

tion’s guidelines in favor of what they con-

sider to be practical or possible — meaning 

instead of desks six feet apart, it’s now “as far 

apart as feasible.”

“I’m torn. I don’t want to get sick,” my 

mother says. “I certainly don’t want to have 

long term consequences. But I also feel like 

we need to do our best to try to open schools. 

And if it doesn’t work, then we at least tried.” 
I 

would like to believe that universi-

ties, and especially public universi-

ties, would be leaders in showing 

what well-run, enlightened leadership would 

do in a crisis situation,” Toyama said. 

We call ourselves the Leaders and Best, 

yet hundreds of faculty remain suspended 

in conflict with the University. Toyama ex-

plained that the University left many deci-

sions regarding COVID-19 and reopening up 

to individual units, meaning departments, 

programs or other clusters of faculty. Some 

units embraced the challenge of online learn-

ing, while others soldiered on with in-person 

teaching. Toyama explained that the instruc-

tions for his department were unclear, but 

that the deans went instructor to instructor, 

asking what each was willing to do to make a 

remote education possible. Allowing individ-

ual units to make decisions for themselves al-

lows for flexibility, but also exposes employ-

ees with less agency within the University.

“There are units on campus where, for ex-

ample, all of the tenure track faculty declined 

to teach in person,” Toyama said. “So (now) 

the lecturers are being required to teach in-

person classes, but they have much less oc-

cupational stability than tenure track profes-

sors, and that seems grossly unfair.”

Just one unit — be it an academic depart-

ment, class, lab, or faculty group — affects 

many different populations of Ann Arbor, 

pressuring people into unjust situations that 
others can opt out of. “We’re a large commu-

nity,” Toyama said, speaking on U-M faculty. 

“We have not seen evidence (for) the people 

who are on the front lines that the leadership 

has their back.” 

In the past few months, Toyama watched 

his colleagues, staff and peers who ensure 

the University functions smoothly be pres-

sured into in-person work. He began orga-

nizing protests and encouraging faculty to 

voice their concerns so the administration 

could make decisions with input from its 

constituents. 

“In my five years in faculty governance, I 

haven’t yet seen the administration give an 

inch on key issues, though they are very good 

at providing the impression that they care 

about our opinions,” Toyama said. “I don’t 

think this is governance, this is dictatorship. 

And, if that seems a little bit alarmist, it’s be-

cause I really believe we are in a moment in 

which we have to do something a little bit 

more than make polite requests.”

U-M is not alone in turning deaf ears to 

its employees. By April 28, 68 New York City 

teachers and staff members had died of CO-

VID-19, which can be attributed as a direct 

result of schools remaining open longer than 

the faculty wanted. “We sort of lost our trust, 

almost, in the school district, because they 

just didn’t act fast enough,” Mihalsky said. 

“But the union really went to bat for us.”

In addition to teaching, Mihalsky is a 

chapter leader in the United Federation of 

Teachers, where he “protects and defends” 

the fifty educators in his chapter from ac-

tion taken without teachers’ input. The UFT 

helped close schools in March, then found 

itself in uncharted territory as it turned to 

face the new school year. “The UFT was very 

clear with the city’s administration and the 

mayor that we need to start planning for next 

year now, and not wait until the last minute. 

Of course, they didn’t. They didn’t listen to 

that,” Mihalsky said. 

And this past week Mihalsky was prepar-

ing his chapter for a strike ahead of NYC 

schools’ reopening on September 10, but 

was told at the last minute that the Union 

had reached a deal with the Department of 

Education and the De Blasio administration. 

They never voted to begin the strike, but 

their uneasiness still lingers. 

The plan pushes the school year back 

by two weeks, meaning students will begin 

September 21, buying the districts time to 

acquire all the necessary PPE, place social 

distancing stickers on the floors, check venti-

lations systems and plan for any other poten-

tial necessity. If any of the requirements are 

not met, the school is supposed to shut down. 

Mihalsky called the deal unrealistic. 

“Teachers are intimidated by administra-

tion,” he said. “They don’t want to say any-

thing.” 

Beyond that, he finds it problematic that 

schools could be open and functional one day, 

then completely shut down the next. “What 

are the parents supposed to do? They didn’t 

plan for their kid to be at home the next day. 

It’s messy.” 

He was hoping for a fully remote year, but 

like many others, spent his summer prepar-

ing for any possible contingency. What the 

general institution overlooks, individuals like 

Toyama and Mihalsky must provide for their 

students, their parents and the educational 

system at large. 
M

ihalsky is in his fourth year of 

teaching, my mother in her 

25th. They’re typically fixated 

on college prep, students’ mental and emo-
tional health, school shooter drills, standard-

ized testing or any number of things. Their 

newest responsibility will be to police how 

their students wear masks and if they social 

distance in the classroom. 

“I never know where to put my focus. 

Am I there mostly to help my kids be stable, 

happy human beings and if I can teach them 

to read and write as well, that’s great?” my 

mother said. “Or am I mostly there to make 

sure we have well informed citizens who can 

read critically, think clearly, write and com-

municate clearly, understand what is fake 

news versus real news?” 

With the pandemic, these concerns in-

crease tenfold. The beginning of September 

brings an increasingly confusing and compli-

cated world. We’re asking our educators to 

assume roles as unscathed physical protec-

tors — a role they never asked for. 

“We don’t need to be called heroes. We 

don’t need to be called any of that,” Mihal-

sky said. What they do need is for society to 

recognize their humanity and adequately ad-

dress their needs through systemic and soci-

etal support, funding and respect. 

“Give us the resources and the opportuni-

ty to do our jobs, and (we’ll) do our jobs well,” 

Mihalsky said. “Teachers are sort of patted 

on the back and told, ‘You’re a hero, look at 

you, you can do this and not get paid a lot. But 

that’s just not enough to get things to work.” 

When we label someone a hero and put 

them on that pedestal, we effectively take 

away any responsibility we feel for their 

safety. We don’t have to think critically about 

them as people and their needs because 

they’re categorized as superhuman. And if 

they die, or they’re hurt, it’s viewed as less 

tragic — it was for a noble cause. This pseu-

do-martyrism makes it easier for us to accept 

their fate rather than show enough gratitude 

to implement a system that actually protects 

them. 

The COVID-19 pandemic has put the 

world on hold, or at least stalled its momen-

tum. We inch along, one day at a time, do-

ing our best to carry on as normal. We bake 

bread and watch Tiger King, play Animal 

Crossing, turn to the streets to protest for 

Black lives and turn inward when the virus 

rages on. But at some point, we’ll be thrust 

back into motion again, and the students in 

today’s classrooms will be moving forward 

into the next part of their lives. 

So how will they have spent this historic 

year? It’s impractical to think everything 

we expect educators to impart and students 

to absorb can fit into one classroom or year, 

even without a pandemic. And it becomes 

virtually impossible to do these things with-

out the support of education’s institutions.

“It can be challenging to feel like you’re 

doing a good job,” my mother told me over 

the phone. We began the interview while she 

drove home from an errand, and I could tell 

she’d made it home and curled up in the driv-

er’s seat, too deep in thought about her life’s 

work to walk into the house. 

I haven’t been in her classroom for a few 

years now, but at one point it was the back-

drop of my life. The east wall is lined with 

pennants from universities her students have 

gone on to, some as a direct result of her help. 

Her passion for education is so strong it’s 

spilled over into my life, too. I’ve watched her 

change the way my friends and peers write, 

and subsequently think about the world, how 

they process information and define them-

selves on paper. By some people’s standards, 

she’d be considered a hero. She’s one of mine. 

But this distinction does not absolve us of 
the responsibilities we carry for the educa-

tors we’ve been privileged to have in our life-

times.

Back to School:
How we’re 
failing those 
who support us

BY ANNE KLUSENDORF, STATEMENT CORRESPONDENT

ILLUSTRATION BY EILEEN KELLY 


I

’ve been settling recently. I’ve settled 

into a new home. I’ve settled into a 

new ro vcutine. I’ve settled into a 

global pandemic. I watch as my friends and 

family seem to do the same. The mention 

of “COVID-19” sounds like the name of an 

estranged relative my family likes to gossip 

about. While I get annoyed when my mother 

brings it up at the dinner table, I can’t help 

but listen to every word, waiting for the next 

update in the soapbox drama that is the hav-

oc of our lives. 

But we should be on the brink of panic. 

There have been more than 188,000 deaths 

in the United States due to COVID-19. Yet, 

here we are. We’ve settled. Perhaps it’s a tes-

tament to the persistence of the human con-

dition — we have to adapt or else we’ll fall 

behind. 

Though we’ve only begun to settle now, 

early March seems like a childhood fever 

dream — hazy, intense and difficult to deci-

pher what’s real and what’s not. But it was 

at that moment that I was still settling into 

a city I had been in for 

only two months, away 

in London on a study 

abroad program. I miss 

the feeling of being un-

settled. 

“Drinks 
are 
so 

much cheaper here,” 

said Abbey, another 

study abroad student 

from New Jersey, as 

she tossed the conve-

nience store cashier 

five pounds. We drank 

Strongbow Dark Fruit 

on the tube to a punk 

show in Shoreditch 

in an effort to not buy 

the expensive drinks 

the venue sold. We 

were 
both 
scholar-

ship students, and we 

couldn’t afford expen-

sive nights out like our 

cohorts. Yet, we were 

also both huge fans of 

punk rock music, and 

we 
were 
absolutely 

thrilled at the prospect 

of going to a show in 

Britain — the birth-

place of punk music, 

which later became 

politicized in places like Latin America and 

Australia. Though today, the genre has shift-

ed greatly from the punk rock of the 70s, we 

were drawn to the outspoken anti-establish-

mentarian politics it still possesses. 

We finagled our way into spending as lit-

tle as possible while enjoying the evening as 

much as we could. Abbey was wearing black 

lipstick to match her black eyeliner and hair. 

I was wearing something not as fashionable, 

I’m sure. Abbey was cooler than she thought 

she was, which made her even cooler. She 

was the one that introduced me to the ven-

ue, and I was just happy she’d asked me to 

go with her. 

I borrowed cigarettes from strangers all 

night, exhaling the smoke from the burnt to-

bacco into the foggy London air. The smoke 

traveled into my own lungs and the lungs of 

the punk rockers on the streets. We shared 

stories with one another, we shared our 

cigarettes and we shared our drinks, too. It 
seemed like we were sharing just about ev-

erything. I feel unsettled by the idea of this 

now, but then, sharing a drink wasn’t some-

thing to be afraid of. 

One of the smokers had graduated from 

the university I was attending in the United 

Kingdom. He studied drama, just as I did, but 

he told me he regretted his decision, lament-

ing his past mistakes and failed job pros-

pects. He finished off his drunken ramble by 

scuffing his cigarette butt into the cement 

and saying, “There’s no way you can control 

anything. Anything at all!” I agreed with him 

then, but I’d soon realize even more just how 

right he was. 

Inside the venue, I pressed my body 

against the hordes of people at the foot of the 

stage, bumping and thumping to the heavy 

drums of the band before me. We crashed 

into one another, letting out screams and em-

bracing each other’s sweat. I view the mosh 

pit of a punk show as the epicenter of what 

punk stands for: a collective of people, typi-

cally lower class, coming together to release 

their pent-up anger toward a system that has 

failed them. Historically, punk music has 

been a symbol for anarchy; in fact, as is stat-

ed in an article by CrimethInc., a decentral-

ized collective website, “A large proportion 

of those who participated in the anarchist 

movement between 1978 and 2010 were part 

of the punk counterculture at some point, in-

deed, many were first exposed to anarchist 

ideas via punk. This may have been merely 

circumstantial: perhaps the same traits that 

made people seek out anarchism also pre-

disposed them to enjoy aggressive, indepen-

dently produced music.”

The lyrics we were moshing to were full 

of angry words directed at demolishing a 

flawed government. Being in the mosh pit 

becomes synonymous with an overwhelm-

ing sense of belonging. As odd as it seems, 

crashing my body into hordes of sweaty 

strangers brought me a feeling of comfort as 

I partook in a collective rage toward a fail-

ing government system. If only I had known 

then that in the months to come, the U.S. 

would fail to protect the lives of hundreds of 

thousands of people. 

Clutching the empty can of Strongbow 

we’d snuck into the venue, Abbey said, “I’ve 

got to pee.” We headed to the bathroom. 

Rows of people were sloshing around, fall-

ing into and over each other. As we passed a 

couple making out in the corner and a man 

yelling at his friend under the TV, I saw a 

familiar pair of eyes peering at me. It was 

Thomas, a student in my study abroad pro-

gram from Michigan State University.

“Hey! What are you doing here?” I 

laughed. I couldn’t believe I saw someone 

I recognized in a city so big — the anonym-

ity of London was one of the most unsettling 
things about it. Running into a familiar face 

felt like I was back at a party in Ann Arbor.

“Hey,” he replied, his response colder 

than I expected. I was surprised; we’d had 

a few classes together abroad, and we’d de-

veloped some type of comradery over being 

from rival schools in the U.S. His response 

was more stoic than usual, so I asked him 

what was going on. 

“Have you seen your email?” he asked. I 

hadn’t — my phone was deep in the pocket 

of my winter coat, buried under piles of oth-

ers by the front door. He showed me his. The 

words of the drunken drama student earlier 

in the night — you can’t control anything! — 

echoed in my head. The email had to do with 

a newly discovered coronavirus that was in-

fecting thousands and threatening the lives 

of millions. The email was clear: Our home 

universities were calling us back to the U.S.

Over the next few days, the city of Lon-

don began to shut down. The tube was scar-

ily empty, and on the off chance you’d sit in 

the same row as someone else, they’d pierce 

you with a look of panic. Hand sanitizer, toi-

let paper and Cadbury chocolate bars were 

among the many goods that were missing 

from the grocery store shelves. Companies 

were offering discounts on major tourist at-

tractions because there were no tourists to 

attract. 

I had about a week until my flight back to 

Ann Arbor, where I’d remain for the foresee-

able future. I wanted to embrace the last mo-

ments of what the city had to offer: West End 

shows, double-decker bus rides and curry 

from the East End. Yet, it seemed as though 

there was no city left. I watched what hap-

pened in the U.S., and the next day, the U.K. 

would follow suit. When Broadway in the 

U.S. shut down, so did the shows in London’s 

West End. When the University of Michi-

gan went online, the universities in England 

did the same. I watched as a country I was 

so familiar with changed completely, and a 

country I was just starting to fall in love with 

morphed into something I could’ve never 

predicted. I was grappling with the pain of 

change two times over. 

Like in the mosh pit, I was again expe-

riencing a collective feeling; though this 

time it was fear instead of rage. We weren’t 

alone in this. Browsing the headlines out of 

both countries and talking with my friends 

abroad, it was clear the same thing happen-

ing there was happening here, and we were 

connected in our struggle.

During my flight’s layover, the enormity 

of this crisis finally hit me, and grief ensued 

as I walked through the Dallas Fort Worth 

Airport. During my time abroad, I had no-

ticed many similarities between the U.K. 

and the U.S. Though I didn’t know it while 

I was sitting at the airport, our two coun-
tries would grow even more similar. Both 

the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-

tion and the National Health Service would 

call on their citizens to wear masks so as 

to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Social 

distancing would be enforced in both coun-

tries. U.K. citizens would be asked to stand 

two meters apart; equivalent to the six feet 

in the U.S. 

As the quarantine days dragged on and 

spring turned into summer, I kept in contact 

with my friends and family in London. Shar-

ing our collective fear, though we were miles 

apart, made me feel less alone. The other day, 

I spoke with my friend Ollie from the U.K. 

via FaceTime, and we mourned over those 

last few days of normalcy before the world 

turned inside out. He commented with a sad 

laugh, “I realized it was bad when the pubs 

started to close because the pubs are never 

closed here … like ever.” 

When I FaceTime my friends across the 

pond, I am met with strange relief. We are 

oceans apart and time zones away, but in a 

way, we still were in the punk show mosh pit 

— now as a combined force battling against 

the threat of the virus, begging our leaders to 

prioritize our lives in their decision-making. 

Yet, it seemed as though our leaders were 

more focused on the economy than us. In the 

U.S., much of the COVID-19 relief ended in 

the midst of the ongoing pandemic. The 

Republican Senate rejected extending the 

$600 enhanced unemployment benefits that 

expired for almost 30 million Americans on 

July 25. 

“If you are making $50,000 a year, it is 

more advantageous to be on unemployment 

insurance than it is to go back to work. That’s 

an example in this legislation of something 

that’s going to hurt, not help the economy,” 

Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, told CNBC. Yet, 

going back to work means more exposure 

to the virus, and for 

many Americans, that 

could lead to some se-

rious health issues. It 

brings me immense sor-

row to think of my fellow 

Americans returning to 

a deadly work environ-

ment just so they can pay 

their rent for the month. 

In the U.K., changes 

to benefits have left dis-

abled people facing pov-

erty. According to the 

Guardian, “The Disabil-

ity Benefits Consortium 

(DBC) said in an open let-

ter to the work and pen-

sions secretary, Thérèse 

Coffey, that changes in-

troduced last week to 

raise the weekly rate of 

universal credit by £20 

would not apply to those 

on legacy benefits. Many 

claimants will not re-

ceive the increase, worth 

more than £1,000 a year, 

because they receive em-

ployment and support 

allowance (ESA), a dis-

ability 
unemployment 

benefit that pre-dates 

universal credit.” 

This will lead many disabled citizens to 

face an unforeseen loss of income and fed-

eral support. Many of my friends and family 

members that live in London are feeling the 

same kind of immense sorrow for their fel-

low citizens that I do for those in the U.S. 

In our phone conversation a few days ago, 

Ollie said that London looks entirely differ-

ent than it did in May. “It’s super busy. The 

streets are packing up again, the tubes are 

getting busier. There is a strange sense of 

normality now.” This may be due to the fact 

that, in an effort to resurge the economy, 

many U.K. businesses have opened up. This 

is not unlike the businesses reopening in the 

U.S. in an effort to continue collecting sales 

tax. This reopening does not come without a 

price, as the U.K. has contended with a sec-

ond wave of COVID-19, while the U.S. is still 

grappling with more than 40,000 new cases 

daily. After my conversation with Ollie, I was 
again amazed at the similarities between the 

U.K. and the U.S. I told him that it seemed as 

though both of our governments valued sav-

ing the economy over saving the lives of their 

citizens. 

“It seems like people are dropping dead 

left, right and center over there,” he said. I 

nodded my head to agree, and we were silent 

for a moment. “I’m scared,” I admitted. “I am 

too,” he agreed. 

I felt comforted to know I wasn’t alone in 

my fear. These past few months have been 

filled with self-quarantining and social dis-

tancing, both of which only bring a sense of 

unsettling isolation. But similar to the punk 

rockers bobbing about in the mosh pit, I’ve 

realized it is our collective feelings that al-

low us to feel some sense of belonging, even 

during these frighteningly isolating times.

Zoom fatigue: A new 
way to be exhausted 
in college

BY LEAH LESZCZYNSKI, STATEMENT COLUMNIST

Wednesday, September 9, 2020 — 16 

W

alking 
briskly 
to 
my 

French class to escape the 

Michigan chill, I savor the 

blinding morning sun and let the autumn 

breeze tangle my hair as I weave through 

the bottlenecks of people in Angell Hall 

to arrive at my first class just a little bit 

early. My classmates line the narrow 

Tisch hallway, most of them scrolling 

mindlessly on their phones, some chat-

ting about today’s homework — what 

they did not understand or failed to com-

plete, fighting sleeplessness under a dim, 

dorm-room light. When 9 a.m. hits, I ex-

change smiles with the cute boy leaving 

the previous section, make a joke about 

being unable to speak French and head 

in for 50 minutes of the bittersweet pain 

that is LSA’s language requirement. A 

year later, these are little moments that I, 

that we, do not have this fall. Now, with 

approximately 78 percent of University 

of Michigan undergraduate credits tak-

ing place entirely online this fall, most of 

our education is entirely remote. Bright 

lecture halls and poorly painted discus-

sion rooms with more bodies than desks 

have been replaced with our own homes, 

apartments and hours upon hours of 

Zoom meetings. 

At the beginning of the pandemic, the 

rapid replacement of in-person gather-

ings with video calls sparked extensive 

discussion of “Zoom fatigue,” a widely-

used label for the impacts of excessive 

virtual meetings on one’s well-being. 

Though some of us forgot the annoyance 

of sitting through an unfulfilling virtual 

discussion once winter classes ended, 

Zoom fatigue is making an un-

welcome return in our stu-

dent lives with the be-

ginning of the fall 

term. Engineering 

junior 
Braden 

C r i m m i n s 

c o m m e n t -

ed on this 

phenomenon in an email to The Daily.

“I’m a computer science major, so I 

spend a lot of my time on the computer 

just to get my work done,” Crimmins 

said. “Having all of my classes over Zoom 

only adds to the time I spend looking at 

a screen.” 

Even if you find joy in not having to 

rush from Angell to your organization 

meetings, seize the opportunity to get 

ready only from the waist up or revel in 

the ability to leave the camera off, Zoom 

fatigue is one of the many new obstacles 

of our current, unfamiliar learning envi-

ronment.

The situations in which we attend our 

virtual classes are stressful in new, pro-

found ways for many of us. Student is-

sues of housing, food security and inter-

net access have been exacerbated by the 

pandemic, with many students experi-

encing the financial and emotional strain 

COVID-19 has created. On top of these 

stressors, there are also aspects of the 

virtual classes themselves that inspire 

the term Zoom fatigue. 

Grainy screens and unstable con-

nections fail to provide us with a large 

amount of the nonverbal cues that help 

us learn and engage with our professors 

and peers. Priti Shah, professor of Cogni-

tion & Cognitive Neuroscience and Edu-

cational Psychology at the University, 

explained in an email interview with The 

Daily the difficulties a lack of nonverbals 

can create.

“Face-to-face interactions rely a lot on 

visual cues. It is easy to tell if people are 

paying 
atten-

t i o n , 

whether someone wants to speak, wheth-

er they are agreeing or disagreeing and so 

forth. In a Zoom meeting, it is much more 

challenging to read people,” Shah said. 

“There is no eye contact, or shared eye 

gaze to provide these cues.” 

The nonverbal cues we are fortunate 

enough to observe are analyzed with 

more effort, energy and assumption, as 

much as can be gleaned from reading a 

person solely from the shoulders or head 

up.

“Even if people are explicitly nodding 

or raising hands, it takes extra effort to 

scan through all the people. … There is 

often a temporal delay,” Shah said. “All 

of these factors make it necessary to con-

sciously think about things that normal-

ly would be fairly automatic.” The con-

scious attention to these little things is 

part of what makes hours of online class-

es and student organization meetings so 

exhausting. 

The ability to multitask during virtual 

meetings also opens the gates to a flood 

of distractions that are less acceptable 

(and oftentimes banned) during in-per-

son classes, allowing us the opportunity 

to lose focus during class. 

“As an educational psychologist, I 

know that under the best of conditions, 

students’ minds wander while listening 

to lectures,” Shah said. “At least some 

studies have found that mind-wandering 

is more pervasive for online lectures than 

in-class lectures.”

In our Zoom lectures, we are tempted 

to text, wander into the alluring abyss 

of social media and respond to emails 

while trying to learn — actions many of 

us avoided during in-person classes to 

maintain our focus and avoid disap-

proving looks from our professors. 

Relatedly, Shah commented on 

how the ability of professors to 

be engaging may be affected 

by virtual classes, explain-

ing that, “Students also 

tend to be motivated 

and attentive when 

they feel that the in-

structor genuinely 

cares about their 

learning … the 

caring may be 

communicat-

ed with eye 

contact, 
or 

smiles or a 

brief inter-

action.” 

For many 

of us, these 

s e e m i n g l y 

trivial 
in-

t e r a c t i o n s 

help us feel 

more 
in-

volved in a 

class, 
which 

would explain 

why their ab-

sence can create 

a 
less 
engaging 

setting, where the 

constant 
allure 
of 

seemingly higher pro-

ductivity poses a threat 

to our focus and learning. 

With all these stressors and changes 

to our education in mind, it makes sense 

why so many of us are experiencing the 

tiring toll of Zoom fatigue. Even more 

daunting is the fact that virtual meet-

ings are not only replacing our classes, 

but numerous other social interactions 

as well, making the onslaught of constant 

video calls overwhelming at times. Our 

student organization meetings are now 

via Zoom — even Festifall used Zoom to 

interact with potential new members in-

stead of seducing open-mouthed, starry-

eyed freshmen with its endless tables and 

scarily enthusiastic canvassers that are 

guaranteed by the usual, in-person for-

mat. 

On the personal side, FaceTime din-

ners, birthday parties and hangouts are 

now a larger part of our social lives than 

ever. But constant video calls are ex-

hausting and a reminder of the fact that 

we are unable to experience the once-

normal ebb and flow of last-minute plans 

and spontaneous, in-person connections 

that create some of the best memories. I 

miss watching my friend from across the 

hall eat eight cookies from the Mosher-

Jordan dining hall after a night of sur-

prisingly competitive pick-up basketball 

at the Central Campus Recreation Build-

ing more than anything (except Mo-Jo 

cookies themselves), but I try to be grate-

ful that I can still see her over FaceTime.

There are greater issues of this time 

than Zoom fatigue, and while exploring 

the additional stressors virtual classes 

create for many of us, we ought to ac-

knowledge the monumental benefits 

video technology provides. We are still 

able to receive a Michigan education (al-

beit, at an increased price), connect with 

our family and friends and continue our 

lives in many ways because of platforms 

like Zoom and FaceTime. LSA freshman 

Megan Mattichak explained some of the 

benefits of her virtual classes in an email 

to The Daily.

“Asynchronous lectures help me learn 

at my own pace, and move ahead of 

schedule earlier in the week, so that I can 

be free on days for extracurricular activi-

ties that I may have not previously been 

free during,” she said.

It is obvious this pandemic — pro-

longed by an ignorant presidential ad-

ministration and many people unwilling 

to follow public health measures — will 

continue to change our world in pro-

found ways, and the pandemic’s impli-

cations for the future of education are 

no different. I hope that in the future, 

we will once again have the luxuries of 

dreading a walk to class in an unpredict-

ed Michigan snow, politely turning down 

canvassers at the front of Mason Hall and 

cramming onto a Blue Bus to get to our 

next class. 

But for now, I’ll continue in this new 

reality: starting each morning after savor-

ing an extra half hour of sleep, watching 

the sun dance off the calleryana leaves 

shining through my childhood bedroom 

windows and wandering to my desk 

donning third day hair and sweatpants, 

grateful for another day and another 50 

minutes of the bittersweet pain that is 

LSA’s language requirement.

On the day the Michigan 

football team was supposed 
to kick off its season against 
Washington, several Wol-
verine players and parents 
instead gathered at Michigan 
Stadium to protest the sea-
son’s postponement.

The protest, which was pri-

marily arranged by Michigan 
parents Peach Pagano (Carlo 
Kemp’s mother), Melissa 
Hutchinson and Lisa McCaf-
frey, included over 50 people 
in total, including a handful 
of players and coach Jim Har-
baugh.

When the Big Ten post-

poned its fall football season 
in August, the players were 
not given input into the deci-
sion. According to senior 
quarterback Dylan McCaf-
frey, they weren’t even told 
of the decision, instead find-
ing out news through Twit-
ter. Rumors have swirled for 
weeks about when the confer-
ence will restart, with dates 
ranging from October to the 
spring.

Those who gathered at the 

Big House intended to make 
their voice heard and send a 
message that they wanted to 
get back on the field as soon as 
possible, as well as to call for 
greater transparency around 
the conference’s decision-
making.

“We’re just hoping to get 

the word out that it wasn’t 
our decision not to play at 
all,” senior quarterback Dylan 
McCaffrey said. “Our play-
ers were fully supportive 
of (playing) and we frankly 
didn’t really know they were 
gonna cancel. … We just 

feel as if the decisions were 
made by a lot of people that 
it doesn’t directly affect. I 
guess we want to know who 
was involved and who voted 
against it. And in that we’d 
love to just be able to talk to 
them, and share our point of 
view as well, which we feel 
like we were not able to share 
at all.”

After leaving Michigan 

Stadium, the group marched 
down Hoover Street and con-
tinued to the Diag. According 
to Pagano, the protest was 
originally intended to end at 

University president Mark 
Schlissel’s home, but that 
plan was scrapped due to con-
struction on South University 
Avenue.

Once on the Diag, protes-

tors chanted, “We want to 
play!” and sang The Victors. 
Then, Chris Hutchinson and 
Jack Harbaugh, Jim’s dad, 
addressed the crowd.

“What an exciting day, just 

think what it could’ve been 
had they allowed us to play,” 
Jack Harbaugh said. “This 
would’ve been kickoff time. 
In the locker room, looking 

around at the sweat beads 
coming off their foreheads, 
looking at each other know-
ing that you’re gonna have the 
chance to play the greatest 
game in America.”

Fifth-year senior defen-

sive lineman Carlo Kemp 
emphasized that throughout 
history, college athletes have 
traditionally not had much of 
a voice in issues that impact 
them. For Kemp, participating 
in the protest was a platform 
to make noise about an issue 
he cared about. He marched 
with a handmade sign that 

read “We want to play” on one 
side and “I say when I play” on 
the other.

Kemp’s sign was a reference 

to the lack of agency he felt 
Big Ten players had around 
whether they would be com-
fortable playing. He pointed 
to the SEC, ACC and Big 12 
as examples of the opposite, 
where players have the oppor-
tunity to opt out or to take the 
field.

“None of us here at Michi-

gan, in the Big Ten, or in the 
Pac-12 really had the opportu-
nity to talk to our families or 

make a decision about going 
forward as if we’re gonna play 
the season,” Kemp said. “Am 
I gonna play the game, am I 
gonna opt out, they gave me 
the option to opt out but we 
didn’t even get that choice 
like some of the other Power 
Five conferences have right 
now where they have a voice, 
they can decide if they want to 
play this season or not, and we 
didn’t have that choice.”

Pagano told The Daily that 

she, Hutchinson and McCaf-
frey arranged the protest to 
support their children on what 
was supposed to be gameday 
and to voice their support for 
having a season. “Our goal 
is to let them play,” she said. 
“That’s the whole thing.”

Kemp originally came into 

Saturday not knowing how he 
would feel waking up on what 
was supposed to be his last 
first day taking the field as a 
Wolverine. But attending the 
protest gave him a purpose 
as well as an outlet to voice 
his frustration. Though he’s 
not sure if any greater change 
will come from it or when 
the season will start, for now, 
Kemp is satisfied he was able 
to speak up.

“I woke up and I woke up 

pretty happy and excited 
today,” Kemp said. “I didn’t 
think this is how I would 
wake up this Saturday, the 
first Saturday of college foot-
ball, but I haven’t had the 
chance to even think about 
that and I’m happy because 
my mind’s been here, focusing 
on Michigan and focusing on 
trying to get the season again. 
Right now I’m happy, I feel 
good, I’m joyful.

“I didn’t think I was gonna 

be saying this on Saturday, so 
I’ll take this right now.”

Cam York and the rise of the 

offensive defenseman

Entering last season, after 

being drafted 14th overall by the 
Philadelphia Flyers, sophomore 
defenseman Cam York had a lot 
on his plate. 

Not only did York surpass 

those 
expectations, 
he 

obliterated them. 

By the end of the season, York 

was a Big Ten Rookie of the 
Year finalist and his defensive 
prowess was apparent. As a first 
line defenseman, he helped the 
Wolverines allow just two goals 
per game, the fewest of any Big 
Ten team while also boasting 
the second-best penalty kill 
percentage, 
defending 
84.3 

percent of power plays. 

Ultimately, though, what sets 

York apart is his two-way ability. 

York’s game is representative 

of a bigger trend across all levels 
of hockey. Defensemen are no 
longer bruisers whose main 
purpose is to block shots and 
make checks. Instead, defenders 
are quick, elusive players who 
can operate as a fourth forward 
when their team is on the rush. 

York proved that he was one 

of these new-age defenders 
by 
contributing 
five 
goals 

and 11 assists in his freshman 
campaign — tied for fourth in 
points on Michigan’s roster 
and third among all Big Ten 

freshmen. 

To set up a goal last season 

against New Hampshire, York 
came flying in from the left side, 
took the puck in stride, glided 
below the net and then snuck 
in the wrap-around attempt 
for the goal. York displayed his 
offensive skill set with a dangle 
to drop the defender and force 
the goaltender to over-commit 
to the wrong side. 

A 
more 
typical 
defender 

would have stopped at the point 
and tried to throw a puck on 
goal.

But not York. 
As soon as he caught the pass, 

York’s intention was to take it all 
the way to the net. He possessed 
the confidence and the hands to 
create this offense. His ability to 
generate scoring opportunities 
like this as a defenseman makes 
Michigan’s offense all the more 
dangerous, especially with a 
shot as good as his.

 In the second period of a 

win against Ohio State last 
January, York took the puck off 
the faceoff and went to work. 
He moved to the left and then 
faked a shot before continuing 
to skate toward the opposite 
faceoff circle. The defender 
was anticipating the earlier 
shot and York recognized this 
and exploited it, catching the 
defender flat-footed, causing 
him to stumble. 

York then loaded up and 

shot back across his body to the 
right. The goaltender had been 
following York as he moved 
laterally and York was able to 
take advantage and fire into 
the space that opened up on the 
right side for the goal. 

York’s offensive ability goes 

beyond scoring, his presence 
can wreak havoc on opposing 
team’s defenses just by touching 
the puck. 

In a win over Notre Dame last 

February, York took a pass and 
stick-handled the puck before 
he pulled back and dished it 
over to sophomore defenseman 
Nick Blankenburg, who ripped 
home a shot for the power play 
goal. On the surface, all York did 
was pass it over, but there’s a lot 
more to this assist — drawing 
the 
defenders 
toward 
him 

opened up a shooting lane in the 
center of the ice for Blankenburg 
to exploit.

Just the fact that York had the 

puck gave the defense a lot to 
think about. He had the ability 
to score as soon as he collected 
the pass. The defender couldn’t 
overcommit to blocking the shot, 
though, because York could have 
made a deke move and took it 
down low. 

The depth chart may list him 

as a defenseman, but York has 
proven he’s far more than that. 
He’s an all-around weapon for 
Michigan to deploy on both ends 
of the ice.

‘It’s using your power for good’: City Police Chief
hoping student-athlete protests lead to change

A sea of maize and blue mixed 

with Eastern Michigan’s green 
colored the sunny Diag. Cardboard 
signs raised over the crowd of 
mask-clad heads, broadcasting 
the words that have become the 
slogan of the summer: “Black 
Lives Matter,” “Say their names,” 
“Racism is the virus,” “Why not 
now?,” “Skin is not a crime” and 
many more. Passionate chants 
reflecting the written words filled 
the silence amid the windy air. 

In the middle of it all was Ann 

Arbor Police Chief Michael Cox 
— a 30-year public safety service 
professional 
originally 
from 

Boston. Cox’s son — also named 
Michael — played football at the 
University of Michigan from 
2009-2011 before transferring to 
the University of Massachusetts 
and going on to get drafted by the 
New York Giants. Cox Sr. thought 
he had seen the last of Ann Arbor 
but came back when offered the 
Chief of Police job in 2019.

Cox, who is Black, showed up 

off-duty Aug. 30 in support of the 
student-athlete-led Black Lives 
Matter protest. 

“Well, actually I got an invite 

to participate or at least show 
support for Black Lives Matter,” 
Cox said. “And it’s not the first 
time I’ve done that.”

There are few who know the 

horrors that Black people face 
in this country better than Cox. 
While undercover in Boston in 
1995, he was brutally beaten by 
his fellow white police officers. 
He was mistaken for a suspect; 
the result was extensive head and 
kidney damage.

It was reported — in a CBS 

Boston article — that Cox was met 
with plenty of resistance when 
trying to receive compensation 
and 
the 
incident 
was 
even 

attempted to be covered up. He 
and his family also faced several 
threats from the public and the 
police department. Cox ultimately 
gained compensation via a civil 
rights lawsuit, but the aftermath 
over the beating caused even more 
damage.

“Being a Black person and 

understanding 
what 
it’s 
like 

growing up in this world, being 
discriminated against and racial 
inequalities and all the things that 
people talk about — that’s me,” he 
said. “I’ve certainly been through a 
lot of things.”

Cox, though, refused to leave 

the department after the incident. 
Within two decades, he rose to 
the second-highest position in 
the Boston Police Department, 
superintendent, and led the Bureau 
of Professional Development and 
the Police Academy.

Cox certainly does not have a 

perfect record; in February he was 
placed on administrative leave 
due to allegations that he created 

a hostile work environment. An 
investigation ordered by the City 
of Ann Arbor concluded this:

“There is no evidence that the 

Chief was behaving in such a way 
(yelling, etc.) as to create a hostile 
work 
environment. 
However, 

there is evidence that people 
feared retaliation by the Chief, and 
they had a legitimate basis for that 
fear, whether or not that was the 
Chief’s intent.”

Still, Cox has dedicated his 

career to trying to fix some 
of the many issues that police 
departments in America have.

“I’ve made it my passion to try 

to get rid of some of these things 
for as much as I can control and 
it’s not easy,” Cox said. “It’s not 
easy cause you don’t always have 
the support because what happens 
on the inside, most people don’t 
understand the culture of the 
things you have to try and change.”

In the past few months of 

protests and marches calling for 
an end to mistreatment of Black 
people in America, police have 
come to the center of attention. 
The videos of George Floyd, Jacob 
Blake, 
Rayshard 
Brooks 
and 

countless others being brutalized 
by police officers serve as daily 
reminders of the deep flaws in the 
justice system.

Michigan parents arrange ‘We want to play’ protest

MILES MACKLIN/Daily

Michigan football players said they would be ready to play at any time during their protest against the Big Ten’s decision to cancel the fall season.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

I 

t’s too bad we 
couldn’t see Jim Har-
baugh’s face under-
neath his mask on 

Saturday. It might have been 
revealing.

Speaking 

to reporters 
while par-
ticipating in 
a parent-led 
protest on 
the Big Ten’s 
postpone-
ment of foot-
ball season, 
Harbaugh 
was asked 
six times in seven minutes 
about University president 
Mark Schlissel. He did his 
best not to publicly criticize 
a man who’s technically his 
boss, but the subtext wasn’t 
hard to see, even without the 
benefit of Harbaugh’s facial 
expressions.

His conversations with 

Schlissel?

“I have had none,” he said.
Does that upset him?
“You think maybe I’ve got 

some inside information or 
something. I really don’t,” he 
said.

He said later that he’s text-

ed and emailed Schlissel to 
show him the football team’s 
COVID-19 testing results. Has 
Schlissel responded?

“Talk to Warde (Manuel). 

Warde talks directly to Presi-
dent Schlissel,” Harbaugh 
said.

You don’t need me to 

explain what that means. The 
very reason Harbaugh was 
there on Saturday was to pro-
test a decision that Schlissel 
helped make.

“Free the Big Ten,” Har-

baugh said. You know, 
because Schlissel and 10 other 
University presidents shack-
led it.

So let’s stop here for a 

minute. The football coach, 
whose salary and public pro-
file dwarfs the University 
president’s, publicly protested 
a major decision that the Uni-
versity president helped make. 

That’s a huge deal in a 

vacuum. But let’s add in some 
context. Harbaugh is in the 
last year of his contract and 
extension talks got tabled 
because of the pandemic. 
Harbaugh also left his last 
job in large part because he 
clashed with people in the San 
Francisco 49ers’ front office, 
a pattern that’s followed him 
throughout his career. 

So, forget the 2020 season. 

Michigan football might have 
a bigger issue on its hands if 
this doesn’t get sorted out.

Schlissel’s transparency, in 

all aspects — be it the football 
season or the fall semester 
writ large — has been embar-
rassingly poor. As it relates 
to this column, his only com-

ment on the season was a 
statement on Twitter in sup-
port of the Big Ten’s decision 
last month. The Daily request-
ed to speak with him this 
week and was told questions 
on the Big Ten and football 
season are being referred to 
Manuel, the athletic director.

That’s fine — and it’s worth 

noting that Manuel, not 
Schlissel, is Harbaugh’s direct 
superior. (He also declined 
an interview request through 
a spokesman). But Manuel 
didn’t have a vote in the deci-
sion to postpone the season. 
Manuel won’t have a vote 
in whether to play later in 
the fall or during the spring. 
Jim Harbaugh didn’t protest 
Warde Manuel’s decision on 
Saturday. He protested Mark 
Schlissel’s.

It’s one thing for Schlis-

sel to duck questions from 
reporters. It’s another for him 
to duck questions from his 
own football coach.

Players at the protest on 

Saturday said Schlissel hasn’t 
shown up at Schembechler 
Hall and hasn’t seen Michi-
gan’s protocols at work. It’s 
unlikely that Schlissel, an 
immunologist, would be con-
vinced to change his mind by 
seeing some football players 
in masks, but it says some-
thing that he hasn’t shown up 
to explain what’s going on, 
why the decision was made, or 
even just to tell the team the 
decision was made.

Schlissel has bigger things 

on his mind than football 
right now, namely getting the 
University’s COVID response 
in order before it derails the 
fall semester. But it’s not ask-
ing much for him to explain 
why he voted to postpone the 
season, to the people whose 
season he voted to postpone. 
Whether you agree with the 
decision or not, that’s a cour-
tesy they’re owed.

“We were getting our infor-

mation from Twitter,” senior 
quarterback Dylan McCaffrey 
said. “And we’re the ones it’s 
directly affecting, unfortu-
nately.”

Speculating on the relation-

ship between Schlissel and 
the football program would 
be unfair, but at this point, it’s 
not speculation to say it’s not 
good. And it’s not unfair to 
start asking what that means 
for the relationship between 
Schlissel and Harbaugh.

For all the criticism Har-

baugh gets as a football coach, 
he’s gotten Michigan to a 
level it hasn’t seen since Lloyd 
Carr was coaching. He’s got a 
five-star quarterback coming 
next year and, quietly, built a 
team this year that was poised 
to surprise some people. It’s 
hard to see the Wolverines 
getting an upgrade if he were 
to leave. More than that, it’s 
hard to see him wanting to 
leave.

He grew up here. His family 

is here and his kids are in the 
schools. His parents are here, 
and his dad even showed up 
to protest on Saturday. He’s 
built Michigan up, but leaving 
without a win over Ohio State, 
a Big Ten title or a New Year’s 
Six bowl — if not a Rose Bowl 
— would leave a bad taste. In 
July, he said a contract exten-
sion was “right there,” prior 
to the pandemic.

As for Schlissel, he signed 

a five-year contract exten-
sion in September 2018. Bar-
ring some kind of disastrous 
fallout of this school year, it’s 
hard to see him going any-
where.

That puts Manuel between 

the two of them, in an impos-
sible position of trying to 
appease Harbaugh, Schlissel, 
donors and everyone else on 
down.

I don’t know where that 

leaves everything, but my 
mind is landing on this quote 
from a 2016 profile on HBO’s 
Real Sports, when Andrea 
Kremer asked Harbaugh 
about his propensity to alien-
ate people.

“That must be true,” Har-

baugh said. “Cause I’d wear 
out my welcome. … People just 
don’t want to be around you 
after a while.”

On Saturday, asked about 

the details of the season he 
wants to play — number of 
games, College Football Play-
off consideration — Harbaugh 
would only say this: “We want 
to play.”

His mouth moved under-

neath the mask, in either 
a smile or a grimace. It 
would’ve been nice to know 
which.

so where does that leave Michigan?

ALLISON ENGKVIST & RYAN LITTLE/Daily

University president Mark Schlissel and football coach Jim Harbaugh are publicly at odds over the Big Ten’s postponement of the season.

Whenever the Big Ten 

decides to resume its season, 
Michigan will be ready.

That was the overwhelm-

ing consensus among players 
who attended Saturday’s “We 
want to play” protest at Michi-
gan Stadium. The Wolverines 
haven’t stopped practicing — 
although practices have been 
non-contact, without pads — 
and according to junior offen-
sive tackle Ryan Hayes, Jim 
Harbaugh has used rumors of a 
mid-October start to motivate 
players to stay ready. While the 
exact amount of time the play-
ers would need varies depend-
ing on who you ask, all of them 
felt it wouldn’t take long.

“If they told us we had a Sun-

day game, we’d be ready tomor-
row,” senior quarterback Dylan 
McCaffrey said at the protest. 
“We’ve been going at it for 
as long as we can. Mentally I 
think our team is sharper than 
ever, physically we’re prob-
ably more in shape than ever 
because we’ve been training 
for so long. I was really proud 
of the whole team the way they 
came back from quarantine in 
shape and ready to go, so I’m 
confident we would be ready 
tomorrow.”

Fifth-year senior defensive 

lineman Carlo Kemp agreed, 
saying that the team would’ve 
been ready to play Saturday if 
they’d had a game — despite 
the fact that Kemp, who missed 
the Citrus Bowl with an injury, 
hasn’t been in pads since 
November.

Harbaugh and junior defen-

sive lineman Aidan Hutchinson 
didn’t have quite as accelerated 
of a timeline, but both said that 
all it would take was two weeks 
in pads for the team to be ready.

“We’re gonna be ready to 

play a game in two weeks,” 
Harbaugh said. “Get the pads 
on and our guys have trained 
without a pause since June 15. 
So that’s our position. We’re 
ready to play as soon as we pos-
sibly can play.”

Michigan’s spring season 

ended before it could start and 
the Big Ten has not yet allowed 
for padded practice. For some 
players, it’s been nearly a year 
since they were last in pads. 
That could seem like a disad-
vantage in getting back to the 
field, but there are some silver 
linings for the players. It’s 
given them more time to learn 
the playbook and focus on tech-
nique, which could prove useful 
in the future.

“It’s been really nice because 

we can start working on our 

footwork and hands really well, 
so once we do put the pads 
on we’ll definitely have more 
technique down,” Hayes said 
Thursday on Zoom. “So that’s 
been one positive about it.”

Chris Evans returns
Chris Evans is in a unique 

situation. The fifth-year senior 
running back was suspended 
for academic reasons before 
spring practice in 2019 and was 
only cleared to return for the 
Wolverines’ bowl practices in 
December.

Since then, Michigan got a 

new offensive coordinator in 
Josh Gattis and two younger 
running backs have emerged 
in Zach Charbonnet and Has-
san Haskins. It was already a 
long road back for Evans, and 
the pandemic has only made it 

longer.

“Just trusting in the process, 

just getting ready to play, day in 
and day out,” Evans said at the 
protest. “It’s gonna be tough, 
me being out, not being able to 
play football since ‘18, but I’ll 
be ready to go when the time 
comes.”

Evans said he attended the 

protest because, “I love football 
and I want to play. It’s best for 
our team right now.”

He described Gattis’ offense 

as faster and more hands-on 
but also easier to learn because 
of the hand signals and boards. 
Evans also said the offensive 
line and running backs room 
were both “looking good.”

Some upperclassmen have 

decided to opt out of whatever 
potential season there is to 
focus on the NFL Draft. Evans 

hasn’t made a choice yet on that 
front.

“I haven’t decided,” Evans 

said. “I don’t know what’s going 
on yet. All I’m focused on is 
whenever they say we play, be 
ready.”

Practicing in a pandemic
In fighting for a season, 

Harbaugh has locked onto a 
particular refrain: Since June 
15, the football program has 
conducted over 800 tests, and 
all have been negative.

Michigan’s lack of positive 

tests doesn’t necessarily mean 
that playing another Big Ten 
team would be as safe — Mary-
land and Iowa have both shut 
down practice after widespread 
outbreaks on athletic teams 
in the past week. But clearly, 
the Wolverines’ protocols are 

working.

Players must wear a mask 

and undergo a temperature 
check to enter the building for 
practice or a meeting. They’re 
also discouraged from leaving 
their homes for anything other 
than class or practice.

“Don’t go out, keep wearing 

a mask, practice social distanc-
ing,” Hutchinson said. “All the 
same rules apply. Obviously it 
gets a little more difficult when 
most students get there because 
you have that aspect of it but I 
think our guys have been doing 
a good job staying away from 
other people and social distanc-
ing on their own.”

There’s an obvious source of 

motivation for Michigan: The 
fewer cases it has, the more 
likely the players are to be able 
to play. According to Kemp, 
the motivation to avoid testing 
positive has led players to avoid 
activities they would normally 
do, such as going boating on the 
weekends.

Beginning in June, the team 

built a culture of distancing 
based on the mindset that they 
wanted to play, and that if they 
didn’t help create an environ-
ment where it was safe to do so, 
the season would be called off. 
Clearly, based on the Wolver-
ines’ test numbers, it’s worked.

“We go from the facility to 

our houses and back to football, 
and that was a true testament 
to everything we believed in 
and what we were trying to 
accomplish,” Kemp said. “And 
we knew that for us to play 
football, this is what we’ve 
gotta do, and guys bought into 
that and they’re still buying 
into it because at any point 
we’re hopeful that the season 
could come up, a game could 
come up, something. And being 
able to just keep that discipline 
is a testament to that charac-
ter.”

Wednesday, September 9, 2020 — 19

On Saturday, the Michigan 

football team would have been 
opening its season against 
Washington in Seattle. Next 
week, it would have been open-
ing its home slate against Ball 
State in Ann Arbor. And The 
Daily would have been there 
for it all. Instead, like everyone 
else, we’ll be sitting at home, 
missing the joys of fall.

So on the day that Michigan’s 

season would have started, 
here’s what we’ll miss most:

Daniel Dash: A certain smell 

of waffles, French toast, eggs 
and biscuits wafts toward the 
Big House press box elevator 
on the morning of each noon 
gameday, but it’s what comes 
before the first bite that always 
stands above the rest. The walk 
through central campus, down 
State Street and into the sea of 
maize and blue flowing toward 
Michigan Stadium never fails 
to energize the soul. When I sit 
down for my first plate of Big 
House breakfast, I’m never able 
to shake the sense of apprecia-
tion. And without football this 
fall, the classic college town 
camaraderie that’s become syn-
onymous with Ann Arbor for 
over a century is what I’ll miss 
most.

Next Saturday, I’ll be sitting 

in my apartment instead of 
filing through fans, tailgaters 
and marching band drummers 
on my way to what would’ve 
been Michigan’s home opener 
against Ball State. As ironic as 
it may be, the football game 
itself is the most replaceable 
component of a game day in 
Ann Arbor. I’ll miss the two 
hours leading up to kickoff and 
the two hours after the final 
whistle infinitely more than the 
three in between, and most of 

all, I won’t be the same without 
the lasting memories and rela-
tionships that only a football 
season can create.

Aria Gerson: Being on The 

Michigan Daily football beat 
is a constant refrain of telling 
people you can’t do something, 
except instead of a normal 
excuse, you’re telling your pro-
fessors, roommates and friends, 
“Sorry, I can’t, I have to go talk 
to Jim Harbaugh,” or, “Sorry, I 
can’t, I’m gonna be in Indiana.”

One of the coolest things 

about covering Michigan foot-
ball is that in 2019, I had the 
opportunity to attend every 
away game and the Citrus Bowl. 
I felt the press box shake at 
Camp Randall Stadium. I saw 
Beaver Stadium all lit up in 
white. I even saw that Quinn 
Nordin 57-yard field goal. Each 
school had its own little quirks. 

Memorial Stadium at Indiana 
has a ton of stairs (which isn’t 
so great when you injured your 
achilles the week of the game). 
Illinois serves frozen custard, 
hot cider and beer in its press 
box. In Madison, we got heck-
led by Wisconsin fans for the 
block ‘M’ bumper sticker on our 
rental car.

The Big Ten is one of the 

oldest conferences in college 
football. Every game was a new 
lesson in history, culture, tradi-
tion and occasionally absurdity. 
This year, I was excited to see 
the gopher on the big screen 
at Minnesota, watch tailgaters 
in Husky Harbor and — yes — 
watch Michigan lose again in 
Columbus. 

So that’s what I’ll miss the 

most. Yes, I love the game of 
football. I love getting frus-
trated by short-range field 

goals and sack celebrations 
and rivalry trophies. But most 
of all, I love the experience of 
immersing myself in a new slice 
of college football culture every 
Saturday. I hope I get to do it 
again.

Theo Mackie: The walk from 

my house to the media entrance 
at Michigan Stadium is 27 
minutes, according to Google 
Maps. On fall Saturdays, it feels 
like about five. Every time, my 
routine is the same. I start the 
walk with my earbuds in, trying 
to put myself in my own world 
before kickoff. But then I get to 
Hill Street, where throngs of 
tailgaters walk around by the 
dozen, all clad in maize and 
blue, and I realize what I’m 
missing out on with earbuds in. 
So I take them out and listen. I 
listen to the tailgaters stressing 
about which party they should 

go to. I listen to the party songs 
blasting from behind the blue 
tarps walled up around every 
yard. Later, walking down 
Hoover Street past Elbel Field, 
I listen to the drumline. When I 
get to the corner of Hoover and 
Greene, I listen to the middle-
aged graduates returning for 
their annual visit to Ann Arbor, 
reminiscing on the glory days. 
Sometimes, I even listen to 
the crazy guy screaming about 
Jesus for a second before tuning 
it out.

Next Saturday, when Michi-

gan would’ve played its home 
opener against Ball State, that’s 
what I’ll miss most. Of course, 
I’ll miss the football too. I’ll 
miss the constant debates and 
controversies. I’ll miss the 
early-morning and late-night 
McDonald’s stops on road trips 
and the desperate searches 

for the media parking lots in 
Bloomington or Champaign 
or State College. I’ll miss put-
ting the finishing touches on 
my story amid the serenity 
of an empty stadium, three 
hours after 110,000 people 
have headed home. But most of 
all, I’ll miss the energy of Ann 
Arbor on a gameday. And when 
it returns some day, I’ll leave 
my earbuds in my bag and never 
take it for granted again.

Ethan Sears: Each week 

before a home game, Dave 
Ablauf, the team’s main spokes-
person, sends a form email 
with media policies and proce-
dures. I don’t read it anymore, 
but when it lands in my inbox, 
there’s a little jolt of excite-
ment I get. It’s one of those 
small things that you take for 
granted, a tiny little reminder 
on a Wednesday or Thursday 
afternoon that there’s football 
happening on Saturday. I’ve 
been missing that email this 
week, and on Saturday I’ll miss 
the walk to Stadium and Main, 
the ride up the elevator and the 
hours before and after the game 
in an empty, silent stadium — 
back when that felt special and 
not like a reminder of every-
thing bad in the world. 

Being in the part of the coun-

try that’s chosen not to play 
football while others do feels 
like your best friend didn’t 
invite you to their birthday 
party. Instead of having fun, 
I’m running through memories 
and imagining what it would 
be like if things were normal 
— instead of writing this on 
Friday afternoon, I’d be on a 
flight to Seattle. I don’t know if 
I’ll watch any of the games on 
Saturday or how it’ll feel if I do. 
It’s probably not healthy to have 
this much of your life tied into 
football, but here I am thinking 
about a form email and wishing 
it would come.

A year after his breakthrough debut, 
Hayes ready to anchor offensive line

It’s forgotten now, amid the 

dawn of a fall unlike any other 
in Ann Arbor, but a year ago 
this week, Ryan Hayes was the 
talk of Schembechler Hall.

Three-hundred-sixty-

eight days ago, Jim Harbaugh 
walked to the podium in one of 
those strange scenes that used 
to be the epitome of normal but 
now induces shutters. A few 
dozen reporters sat shoulder 
to 
shoulder 
and 
scribbled 

notes as Harbaugh spoke. The 
strangest note that day was 
that Hayes was Harbaugh’s 
offensive player of the week for 
his performance in Michigan’s 
mundane, 
40-21, 
season-

opening win against Middle 
Tennessee.

It was unexpected then, 

because Hayes was a late injury 
replacement for Jon Runyan 
Jr. at left tackle. To his right 
along the offensive line, there 
were four future NFL Draft 
picks. But Harbaugh’s primary 
takeaway wasn’t about them. It 
was about Hayes.

“We learned Ryan Hayes is 

pretty darn good,” Harbaugh 
said then.

That 
revelation 
was 

important for the Wolverines 
because of this week, and what 
this week was supposed to 

bring. Michigan, back in the 
before times, was scheduled 
to travel to Washington this 
weekend, a mighty challenge 
for the first game of the post-
Shea Patterson era. Making 
that 
challenge 
even 
more 

difficult was the anticipated 
departures of Runyan, Ben 
Bredeson, 
Cesar 
Ruiz 
and 

Michael Onwenu along the 
offensive line.

All of which is why Hayes’s 

revelation as a trustworthy 
left tackle was so critical, 
even back then. This month, 
though, Hayes became even 
more important. When Jalen 
Mayfield — a potential first-
round 
pick 
next 
April 
— 

declared for the NFL Draft 
on Aug. 18, Hayes suddenly 
became the centerpiece of 
Michigan’s offensive line, even 
with just two career starts.

From Kwity Paye’s vantage 

point across from Hayes in the 
Wolverines’ pad-less practices, 
Hayes’s growth in the new role 
was evident instantly.

“Ryan Hayes has taken that 

leadership role on the O-line,” 
Paye said Thursday. “I feel like 
he’s been getting those guys 
right.”

Hayes, 
for 
his 
part, 
is 

reluctant to accept that praise. 
He says his nature is to lead 
by example. In the wake of 
Mayfield’s departure, he says 
he’s “been trying to be a little 

bit more vocal and work on 
that side of leadership than 
just work by example.”

What he doesn’t need any 

adapting to is the on-field 
work. That part has been a 
work in progress since he 
arrived on campus as a lanky 
tight end. Over the past year, 
he’s completed his transition 
into 
a 
filled-out 
offensive 

tackle. “From here to last 
year, I definitely feel bigger, 
stronger, I feel more capable to 
do things,” Hayes said.

Most of that work, though, 

came while redshirting his 
freshman year and learning 
the finer points of playing 
offensive tackle from offensive 
line coach Ed Warinner — 
and guys like Mayfield and 
Runyan.

“To see what he looked like 

from his first day to Saturday, 
it’s 
like 
night 
and 
day,” 

Mayfield said after the Middle 
Tennessee game. “It’s crazy to 
see how much he’s grown and 
how much he’s learned over 
this past year and I just can’t 
wait to see how much grows 
this year.”

A year later, compare that 

to how Hayes speaks about his 
younger teammates.

“Two younger guys that 

really impress me: (sophomore 
Karsen 
Barnhart)’s 
really 

stepped up since Jalen left, 
been 
playing 
really 
well,” 

Hayes said. “And then Zak 
Zinter does not look like a 
freshman at all. Zinter has 
really impressed everyone.”

Here he is, the guy who just 

a year ago was the young player 
being talked about, now doing 
the talking. It’s a role Hayes 
could never have expected this 
time last year, when Mayfield 
had two years of eligibility left.

But now, whenever Hayes’s 

next game comes, it’s a role 
he’ll be ready for.

“I was pretty nervous going 

into (the Middle Tennessee) 
game, 
not 
knowing 
what 

would happen, not knowing 
anything,” Hayes said. “This 
year, 
it 
feels 
completely 

different. I’m not scared.”

Ryan Hayes has grown into a leader along the Wolverines’ offensive line.

Mike Smith ready to embrace a new 

challenge at Michigan

Sometimes it’s as simple as 

honesty and interest. 

At least it was for fifth-year 

senior Mike Smith. 

Last spring, as the former 

Columbia point guard narrowed 
down his list of transfer suitors, 
the 
candid 
and 
persistent 

approach of Michigan coach 
Juwan Howard stood out among 
the rest. In early April, Smith 
chose 
the 
Wolverines 
over 

Gonzaga, Arizona and Seton Hall. 

“I think coach Howard just 

showed a little more interest than 
some of the other schools,” Smith 
said. “He just reached out to me 
and from day one, he’s always 
been honest in telling me where 
I’d fit in and what kind of player 
he’d need for next year.

“He said it was between me 

and Bryce Aiken, who is now at 
Seton Hall and went to Harvard. 
He said me and him were the only 
two guards he was recruiting 
and from everything I had seen 
back then, I knew he was being 
honest because nobody else was 
being recruited. So I knew he 
was trustworthy and a man of his 
word.”

With 
Zavier 
Simpson 

graduating and junior guard 
David DeJulius transferring to 
Cincinnati, Michigan entered the 
offseason in need of backcourt 

depth. Smith, who led the Ivy 
League with 22.8 points per game 
as a senior, provides exactly that. 

Though Big Ten competition 

is a significant step up from that 
of the Ivy League, Smith is no 
stranger to high-level opponents. 
As a senior at Fenwick High 
School in Oak Park, Ill., Smith 
finished second in Mr. Basketball 
voting, helped the Friars win the 
notoriously competitive Chicago 
Catholic League championship 
and a school-record 28 games, 
and finished his career second 
on the school’s all-time scoring 
list behind 14-year NBA veteran 
Corey Maggette. 

Smith committed to Columbia 

relatively early his senior year. 
Just 5-foot-10 and 165 pounds 
at the time, most of his suitors 
were at the mid-major level. 
Smith’s 
success 
that 
season 

earned him a bit more attention 
on the recruiting trail, but he 
stayed committed to the Lions 
throughout. Looking back now, 
he wouldn’t change a thing. 

“I think Columbia was the 

best decision of my life,” Smith 
said. “There’s always going to be 
a life after basketball. I’m setting 
myself up now for when I’m 36, 
and I can’t touch a basketball 
anymore. I’m going to be set for 
life with just the connections I’ve 
made and the Ivy League degree 
that I have.” 

With a bachelor’s degree in 

Sociology in hand, Smith is now 

pursuing his master’s at Michigan. 
He’ll have the opportunity to 
test himself in one of college 
basketball’s best conferences, too. 
It’s a challenge those who know 
him best think he’s ready for. 

“Mike’s got a great personality 

and a lot of charisma and 
confidence,” Fenwick basketball 
coach Staunton Peck said. “One 
of his best traits is his confidence. 
He instills confidence in his 
teammates as well. It didn’t 
matter who he was playing 
against, he thought he was as 
good or better than the guys he 
was playing.”

Smith 
attributes 
that 

confidence to his work ethic and 
practice schedule — both of which 
have improved under the tutelage 
of his mentor and friend, Miami 
Heat star Jimmy Butler. The two 
first connected during Smith’s 
senior season at Fenwick when 
Butler played for the Chicago 
Bulls. They’ve trained together 
ever since with Smith even 
spending summers out at Butler’s 
home in Calabasas, Calif. 

“Being around Jimmy so much 

and our little crew, we all work 
out together,” Smith said. “We 
work out four times a day in the 
summer. And ultimately, since 
he’s in a spot I wanna be in — you 
know, I want to be able to play 
in the NBA, I want to be able to 
make that type of money and 
play in those types of games — if 
that’s what it takes, then that’s 
what I’m going to do. I think my 
confidence comes from my work 
and repetition. 

“If you continue to work hard, 

you can feel confident in yourself 
when you get stuck that you’re 
going to make that shot that you 
shot 300 times the day before or 
the morning before the game. 
With all things in life, when you 
do things repetitively and keep 
doing that, then you’ll feel more 
confident.” 

Smith’s 
relationship 
with 

Butler also gave him unique 
insight on Howard’s demeanor 
and coaching style due to Butler’s 
connections around the league.

Avenue, 
where 

University 
President 

Mark 
Schlissel 

resides. 
Organizers 

scrapped that due to 
construction.

If 
they 
hadn’t, 

Michigan coach Jim 
Harbaugh would have 
been protesting outside 
his president’s house.

Schlissel, according 

to 
documents 

obtained in a lawsuit 
by frustrated players 
from 
Nebraska, 
was 

among the Big Ten 
presidents who voted 
to postpone the season 
by an 11-3 margin. His 
only public comment 
on the situation has 
been 
a 
statement 

on the day of the 
season’s postponement 
supporting 
the 

decision. 
The 
Daily 

requested 
to 
speak 

with him this week and 
was denied. He hasn’t 
spoken with Harbaugh 
— or anyone else with 
the football program — 
either.

“I have had none,” 

Harbaugh said when 
asked 
about 
his 

conversations 
with 

Schlissel. 
“We’ve 

texted 
and 
(athletic 

director) 
Warde 

Manuel’s done all the 
conversations 
with 

President Schlissel.”

Players said Schlissel 

hasn’t 
been 
to 
the 

practice facility and 
hasn’t explained his 
reasoning 
to 
them 

either. Harbaugh said 
he’s sent texts and 
emails, but when asked 
whether 
Schlissel 

has 
responded 
to 

any of them, he only 
said, “Talk to Warde. 

Warde talks directly to 
President Schlissel.”

Showing 
up 
at 

Saturday’s 
protest, 

organized by Michigan 
football parents to rally 
in favor of a fall football 
season, isn’t the first 
time 
Harbaugh 
has 

publicly 
contradicted 

Schlissel on the issue. 
The day before the 
season’s postponement 
was 
made 
official, 

Harbaugh 
sent 
a 

lengthy 
statement 

outlining 
why 
he 

believed it was safe 
to play. Chief among 
the 
reasons 
was 

Michigan’s 
lack 
of 

positive 
COVID-19 

tests.

According 
to 
an 

update sent Saturday 
morning, 
Michigan 

athletics had four new 
positive tests in the last 
week among players 
and coaches from all 

teams. 
The 
football 

program 
went 
the 

entire month of August 
without a positive test.

“You think maybe 

I’ve got some inside 
information 
or 

something. 
I 
really 

don’t,” Harbaugh said. 
“I can tell you how 

practice was, I can tell 
you how the workouts 
have been. I can tell 
you we just had another 
120 tests that were all 
negative. That’s close 
to 1,000 tests in a row 
completely 
negative. 

I can tell you how the 
guys’ grades are right 
now. That’s really the 
things I’m focused on 
is just training and 
coaching our guys.”

In 
other 
words, 

without 
publicly 

saying he’s upset at the 
University 
president, 

Harbaugh 
explained 

why 
he 
would 
feel 

that 
way. 
All 
the 

coaches in the Big Ten 
want to play, he said. 
High school football 
in Michigan is back 
on. The team feels it 
can be ready soon, 
and 
Harbaugh 
has 

told them playing in 
October is a possibility 
despite 
conflicting 

reports on the matter.

“You 
give 
me 
a 

couple weeks in pads, 
two weeks, I’m ready 
to go,” junior defensive 
end Aidan Hutchinson 
said. 
“We 
haven’t 

stopped practicing.”

It’s not a given that 

playing would be safe 
right 
now. 
A 
game 

between TCU and SMU 
was just postponed due 
to positive tests. In the 
Big Ten, Maryland had 
an outbreak this week.

“I don’t know what’s 

going on in the rest of 
the world,” Harbaugh 
said. “I know what 
we’re doing.”

Walking as thin a 

line as he could with 
recorders in front of 
him, Harbaugh didn’t 
leave 
much 
about 

his 
position 
to 
the 

imagination.

“Well I mean, would 

have 
rather 
been 

coming to a game than 
a rally,” he said. “But 
(that) definitely hits 
you. We should’ve been 
playing a game today.”
