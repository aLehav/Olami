The University of Michigan’s 
Board of Regents met for their 
first meeting of the 2019-2020 
school year Thursday. Regents 
Jordan Acker (D) and Michael 
Behm (D) were not present, and 
chair Ron Weiser (R) arrived 
late. 
University President Mark 
Schlissel began the meeting by 
thanking E. Royster Harper, 
vice president for Student Life, 
for her time at the University. 
Harper 
announced 
her 
retirement this week.
“After 
an 
amazing 
four 
decades 
of 
service 
to 
the 
University and to generations 
of our students, among student 
life leaders in our nation, Dr. 
Harper has set the standard,” 
Schlissel said. “And it’s a very 
high standard. Throughout her 
career, including 18 years as vice 
president, she worked tirelessly 
to enrich the lives of students. 
She supported their academic 
and career aspirations, their 
health and their goals as people 
so they could reach their full 
potential.”
Schlissel then discussed the 
University’s new measures to 
prevent 
sexual 
misconduct, 
including 
a 
new 
online 
module that is required for all 
employees. He said nearly half of 
the University’s employees have 
completed it so far. 
“Already, 
47 
percent 
of 

University 
employees 
have 
completed training,” Schlissel 
said. “The senior leadership 
takes this very seriously, and I am 
pleased to report that all regents, 
executive officers and deans on 
all three of our campuses have 
already completed this training. 
The deadline for completion is 
December 31.” 
Ben Gerstein, Public Policy 
junior and president of Central 
Student 
Government, 
then 
took the stand. He started by 
discussing what CSG hopes to 
accomplish this year. 
“Our 
priorities 
for 
the 
upcoming year include elevating 
student voices in the potential 
renovations to North Campus, 
namely for an increase in North 
Campus’s health and wellness 
resources,” 
Gerstein 
said. 
“Additionally, we are acting on 
student concern surrounding 
financial barriers to academic 
inclusion and success, namely 
textbook affordability and the 
high cost of homework access 
codes.”
Gerstein 
continued 
by 
expressing CSG’s support for 
the Washtenaw County Climate 
Strike tomorrow, and for the 
University in joining the Climate 
Change Coalition.
“I want to acknowledge the 
activists organizing tomorrow’s 
Washtenaw 
County 
Climate 
Strike 
for 
highlighting 
an 
important cause through their 
activism 
and 
showing 
the 
urgency of action,” Gerstein 
said.

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-EIGHT YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Pushing 
a 
strand 
of 
magenta hair out of her face, 
Ruth 
Leonela 
Buentello 
recovered from a tearful 
moment. 
Buentello, 
this 

year’s Efroymson Emerging 
Artist 
in 
Residence, 
was 
recounting an incident in her 
hometown of San Antonio 
where nine migrants died in 
a case of human smuggling. 
The migrants, who were 
undocumented and had most 

likely just crossed the U.S.-
Mexico border, died after 
spending hours in a Walmart 
van without air conditioning 
in the middle of a notoriously 
hot Texas summer. 
“They were begging for 
their lives,” Buentello said. 

“And 
no 
one 
published 
their names, their family 
members. … I just don’t know 
how to not feel and not say 
something.”

Ann Arbor Public Schools 
will allow students to leave class 
to participate in the “Global 
Climate Strike” on Friday if their 
parents approve. 
In a letter to parents that was 
posted online by the organizers 
of 
the 
Washtenaw 
County 
Climate Strike, AAPS Deputy 
Superintendent David A. Comsa 
said the schools aim to provide a 
safe environment for students on 
campus.
“We 
are 
clear 
that 
our 
students are expected to be 
in school and to remain on 
school grounds,” Comsa wrote. 
“Students may only be excused 
from our campuses with parental 
permission in advance of an off-
campus event. Our work with 
our student leaders is focused 
on activities on our campuses. 
With 
advisement 
from 
law 
enforcement, we discourage our 
students from gathering at any 
sites off of our campuses.”

Author discusses taking personal 
action to mitigate climate change

RUCHITA IYER/Daily
New York Times bestselling author Jonathan Safran Foer speaks on food sustainability in his latest book “We are the Weather: Saving the Planet Begins at 
Breakfast” at Rackham Auditorium Thursday night

Jonathan Safron Foer highlights new book at signing at Rackham Auditorium

Best-selling author Jonathan 
Safran Foer spoke to a crowd 
of several hundred people at 
Rackham Auditorium for a book 
talk 
Thursday 
evening. 
The 
Ford School of Public Policy 
collaborated with the Literati 
Bookstore to host the event.
Foer’s book, “We are the 
Weather: 
Saving 
the 
Planet 
Begins at Breakfast,” focuses 
on changes people can make in 
their immediate lives to promote 
environmental 
sustainability. 

Foer 
highlighted 
four 
major 
contributors to climate change: 
airplane travel, overpopulation, 
cars and food consumption. The 
way people eat is just as important 
as the other three since it also 
deals with dangerous pollutants, 
Foer said. 
“Eating is the only one of 
those that immediately addresses 
nitrous oxide and methane, which 
are 
two 
extremely 
powerful 
greenhouses gases,” Foer said. “I 
think there are focuses exclusively 
on fossil fuels. It’s good to have 
a focus on fossil fuels, but bad to 
have a focus exclusively on fossil 

fuels.” 
The discussion was moderated 
by Ivette Perfecto, a professor 
in the School for Environment 
and Sustainability. She asked 
Foer why he did not talk more 
about the political side of climate 
change. 
“Is this a tactical device 
because do you think that people 
would dismiss you … or do you 
truly think that capitalism has 
nothing to do with it?” Perfecto 
asked. 
Foer said he wanted to focus his 
book on a part of climate change 
that is not talked about enough.

“The focus of the book is 
individual action,” Foer said. “In 
the same way that I acknowledge 
the fossil fuel industry is a 
profound problem, but I don’t 
really write about it in the book 
because I feel like a lot of people 
are giving a lot of attention to it.” 
He acknowledged that, though 
the government needs systemic 
change, it cannot be done without 
some individual change. 
“The 
government 
needs 
our help and we need the 
government,” Foer said.

A team of University of 
Michigan and University of 
California, 
San 
Francisco 
researchers developed a new 
technology able to efficiently 
produce human-like embryos, 
also called embryoids. The 
research was published in 
Nature on Sept. 11.
Other 
scientists 
have 
created embryoids in the past, 
which are made by coaxing 
human stem cells to behave 
and organize into structures 
similar to ones found in very 
early human embryos. The 
researchers specifically use 
pluripotent stem cells, which 
are able to differentiate into a 
variety of cell types.
The new technology uses 
a 
microfluidics 
device 
in 
which scientists first insert 
pluripotent stem cells and 
then 
add 
chemicals 
that 
stimulate the cells to develop 
into 
human 
embryo-like 
structures.

B E HIND THE STORY

QUOTE OF THE WE E K 

“
A public university should not be in the business of deciding 
which of their students get to host speakers or speak their minds. It is 
the government’s responsibility to ensure that our rights are protected, 
and if the First Amendment is being trampled on or amended by speech 
codes or unfair treatment, then it is absolutely within their purview to 
stop that from happening.”

LSA senior Kate Westa, former vice chair of the University’s chapter of Young America’s Foundation and current co-president 
of political organization WeListen

Every Friday, one Daily news staffer will give a behind the 
scenes look at one of this week’s stories. This week, LSA junior 
Emma Stein wrote about Michigan’s ban on flavored e-cigarette 
products.

“I think my favorite part of the story was that the sources were able 
to be anonymous, and they were able to be fully open with what they 
wanted to say. Because vaping is a super important part of the social 
scene here… but it’s not talked about. Everyone’s talking about the ban, 
but no one’s talking about what’s going to happen next. So I think that 
starting an open dialogue about it was really important, and I liked 
being a part of that.”

Emma Stein: “Whitmer’s ban of flavored vape products could lead 
to jail time, cause students to turn to cigarettes”

Earthfest welcomes environmentally 
conscious organizations, nonprofits

Event provides platform for students to interact with groups fighting climate change

The Diag was packed 
with 
students 
walking 
from 
table 
to 
table 
participating in Earthfest 
Thursday afternoon. The 
event was hosted by Planet 
Blue, an institution at the 
University 
of 
Michigan 
that leads, organizes and 
manages the University’s 
Sustainability Initiative.
Earthfest 
is 
centered 
around the four themes 
of 
the 
University’s 
Campus 
Sustainability 
Goals: 
climate 
action, 
waste prevention, healthy 
environments 
and 
community 
awareness. 
Earthfest hosts academic 
departments, 
student 
organizations 
and 

community 
non-profit 
groups 
focused 
on 
sustainability, promoting 
their 
work 
on 
campus 
and in the Ann Arbor 
community.
The 
brightly 
colored, 
sustainability-themed 
stands on the Diag included 
clubs and organizations 
that 
educate 
students 
on 
food 
sustainability, 
promote 
environmental 
sustainability 
and 
organize 
athletic 
adventures 
and 
trips 
around Michigan.
Earthfest 
incentivized 
students to talk to orgs 
by 
offering 
free 
food 
depending on the number 
of stamps they received at 
different tables. 
In the midst of the 

growing 
impact 
of 
climate change on the 
planet, Earthfest seemed 
more 
pertinent 
than 
ever on campus to some 
participating 
students. 
LSA senior Vanessa Dinh 
noted how as a prominent 
university, the University 
should 
be 
increasing 
awareness of the climate 
crisis in light of a lack 
of change coming from 
political officials.
“As a big university, 
we 
should 
be 
leading 
the 
change 
to 
more 
environmental 
issues 
because of a lot of the 
leadership in politics … 
they aren’t really thinking 
about that,” Dinh said. “It’s 
up to us and up to students 
and young leaders to take 
up that charge.”
LSA senior Caroline 
Baloga, 
who 
is 
in 
the Program in the 
Environment, 
echoed 
Dinh’s 
sentiments 
but was hopeful that 
students seemed to be 
engaging 
more 
with 
environmental issues.
“I 
think 
the 
University of Michigan 
as a Big Ten school is 
kind of falling behind 
on sustainability, and 
I think that students 
are recognizing that,” 
Baloga said. “So, it’s 
really cool that there 
are all sorts of different 
organizations 
that 
are kind of focusing 
in 
on 
an 
issue 
of 
sustainability.”
Students said they 
were 
interested 
in 
educating 
themselves 
and finding ways to 
make a difference in 
reducing their carbon 
footprint.

LSA 
senior 
Kenzie 
Dalton was tabling for 
Camp Michigania and said 
she was impressed not 
only with the turnout for 
the event, but also with 
the commitment students 
were exhibiting.
“I think it shows our 
faith in science, and that 
we trust the scientists, 
and that we are ready 
to move forward and do 
some policy changes to 
protect the earth,” Dalton 
said. “And the popularity 
of Earthfest shows that 
it’s important to a lot of 
students.”
 
Several 
Earthfest 
participants, 
including 
LSA 
senior 
Isabel 
Nakisher, 
said 
they 
planned on joining the 
Washtenaw 
County 
Climate Strike tomorrow. 
The 
strike 
will 
take 
place Friday morning on 
Ingalls 
Mall. 
Students, 
faculty 
and 
community 
members are invited to 
walk out at 11 a.m. from 
their classes and jobs. The 
strike will culminate with 
a rally at noon, followed 
by 
workshops 
and 
performances throughout 
the afternoon. 
“I recently went abroad 
to Ecuador and learned 
about a lot of these things 
that activists are pushing 
for and that our strike is 
pushing 
for 
tomorrow,” 
Nakisher said. “So, I think 
doing it right now is a great 
opportunity for people to 
see and learn about things 
that they might not realize 
that’s happening in their 
everyday lives.”

“CSG 
is 
encouraged 
by 
the 
President’s 
Commission 
on 
Carbon 
Neutrality 
and 
its joining of the Climate 
Change Coalition. We hope the 
University continues to take 
meaningful steps to reduce our 
carbon footprint.”
The Board of Regents then 
unanimously 
approved 
the 
construction of a new University 
in-patient 
hospital 
next 
to 
the 
Frankel 
Cardiovascular 
Center. The hospital has an 
estimated cost of $920 million, 
will be 12-stories tall and will 
house 264 private rooms. It is 
expected to open in the fall of 
2024.
Regent Shauna Ryder Diggs 
(D) said the new hospital will 
help Michigan Medicine treat 
all patients to the best of their 
ability with new technology. 
She said the planning process 
took around two and a half 
years.
“The 
team 
at 
Michigan 
Medicine has taken great care 
to consider the needs of both 
patients and families, both now 
and in the future,” Diggs said. 
“This new hospital will enable 
healthcare providers to quickly 
respond to complex cases with 
the highest level of patient 

safety, infection control and 
the delivery of state-of-the-art 
treatments.” 
T. Anthony Denton, senior 
vice 
president 
and 
chief 
operating officer of Michigan 
Medicine, then spoke about the 
hospital. He said a big reason 
the University needs to build 
a new hospital is to make sure 
there are enough resources and 
employees for all patients. 
“The challenge is access 
and capacity,” Denton said. 
“It’s been a running story for 
a while, but I would suggest to 
you that it’s a good challenge. 
It demonstrates that we are a 
provider of choice … being busy 
means that we are providing 
a service to our community. 
However, it does create access 
constraints for people who 
want to get into our hospital 
who can’t.”
Denton 
concluded 
by 
saying Michigan Medicine is 
dedicated 
to 
environmental 
sustainability. He said part of 
the reason the hospital costs 
so much is because they tried 
to make it as environmentally 
friendly as possible. 
“We 
have 
been 
very 
committed to environmental 
sustainability for decades at 
Michigan Medicine,” Denton 
said. “We believe that it is so 
important to take care of our 
home and serve the community 

… we believe that investment 
in the future will give us the 
innovation, it will give us 
the access, it will give us the 
capacity that we need to serve 
our future.” 
Public 
commenters 
at 
the 
meeting 
addressed 
issues relating to pedestrian 
safety, wrongful child abuse 
convictions and funding for 
STEM programs, among other 
concerns. 
Multiple 
commenters 
expressed concern about the 
lawsuit against Black Girls 
Code, a summer coding program 
at Wayne State University. 
In 
February, 
University 
of 
Michigan-Flint professor Mark 
Perry filed a claim against 
Wayne State alleging the school 
violates Title IX by holding a 
summer workshop aimed solely 
at girls. In response, Williams 
and about 15 other National 
Action 
Network 
members 
demonstrated outside the home 
of University President Mark 
Schlissel to call for Perry’s 
firing. 
Charles 
Williams 
II, 
president 
of 
the 
Michigan 
chapter of NAN, addressed the 
Regents about Perry’s claim 
and representation in STEM 
fields. Williams pointed out the 
lack of racial diversity in the 
University’s STEM programs 
and urged the University to 

take immediate action against 
Perry. 
“If you begin to investigate 
the 
graduate 
programs 
in 
STEM and in other disciplines, 
you will see rarely African 
Americans admitted into your 
programs,” 
Williams 
said. 
“We know the University of 
Michigan 
fought 
hard 
for 
affirmative action … but what 
we don’t know is if their 
commitment is sincere. Where 
is the University of Michigan’s 
footing in Detroit?”
Josh Mack, University alum 
and NAN member, emphasized 
Williams’s points and shared 
his own experience at the 
University as a doctoral student 
in the early 1970s. Mack said 
he faced social and economic 
challenges as a black student 
and added that he hoped the 
University 
would 
continue 
supporting STEM programs, 
including those that reach out 
to minority groups. 
“Our Constitution of the 
United States is designed to 
make our country a more 
perfect union,” Mack said. 
“With the STEM program, 
if we continue to support the 
STEM program and the Bridge 
program 
and 
the 
(Women 
in Science and Engineering) 
program, it continues to make 
the University of Michigan 
a 
more 
perfect 
learning 

institution.”
Community 
members 
involved with Torn Family, 
an organization dedicated to 
overturning false convictions 
of Shaken Baby Syndrome, 
addressed the Regents about 
cases related to University 
hospitals. 
Douglas 
Smith, 
a 
retired 
professor of pathology at the 
University and a board member 
of Torn Family, called on the 
University to hold a formal 
discussion about wrongful child 
abuse convictions in an academic 
and scientific setting. Smith 
said although LSA and the Law 
School held a day-long conference 
a few years ago to address the 
issue of Shaken Baby Syndrome, 
representatives from the Medical 
School refused to participate. 
“The courtroom is a terrible 
place to have a scientific or 
medical debate,” Smith said. 
“We need to have academic 
platforms for debate. But as 
long these faculties refuse 
to acknowledge that there is 
something to debate, it won’t 
happen … This Board would 
be doing a great service for 
the education of doctors and 
the safety of families if this 
debate were to happen.”

Jianping 
Fu, 
associate 
professor 
of 
mechanical 
engineering, led the team that 
has worked on the project since 
2015. He said his team was able 
to generate embryoids with 
about 5 to 10 percent efficiency 
a few years ago, while the new 
technology is about 95 percent 
efficient.
Yi Zheng, a post-doctoral 
research fellow in Fu’s lab, said 
he felt encouraged by all the 
attention the research received.
“I published quite a few 
research papers before, but 

none of them generated so 
many interests and attentions 
from 
both 
academia 
and 
the public,” Zheng said in 
an email to The Daily. “It is 
very interesting to read about 
other’s comments from totally 
different perspectives. I feel 
quite proud that my research is 
found useful and important by 
the top scientists in the field, all 
my hard work finally pays off.”
LSA 
junior 
Gillian 
Rubenstein said she read the 
paper after finding a link to it 
in a newsletter from Nature. 
Rubenstein, who is interested 
in gender and health, said 
she’s excited for the possible 
implications the research has 

and the fact it’s emerged in the 
reproductive field.
“(Stem cell research) doesnt 
seem like, so far, it’s gotten 
into the reproductive field, so 
I thought it was really exciting 
that potentially we could create 
embryos out of stem cells,” 
Rubenstein said.
Fu said the new technology 
could 
aid 
scientists 
in 
learning 
more 
about 
what 
he calls the “black box of 
human 
development.” 
This 
is the first few weeks after a 
sperm fertilizes an egg and 
the embryo implants into the 
wall of the uterus, called the 
preimplantation stage.
“During this period, many 

miscarriages can happen and 
serious birth defects can form 
as well,” Fu said. “I think we are 
very excited and very hopeful 
that this system … has generated 
a 
reliable, 
experimental 
platform 
for 
answering 
fundamental questions about 
human development.”
Scientists have a good idea 
of what happens for the nine 
months of pregnancy, but have 
had 
trouble 
understanding 
the 
preimplantation 
stage 
because 
the 
embryo 
isn’t 
easily accessible during this 
period. The 1984 Warnock 
rule has also made it difficult 
to research preimplantation 
— the Warnock rule, also 

known as the 14-day rule, bars 
researchers 
from 
studying 
human embryos beyond 14 
days of development for ethical 
reasons.
Fu said there are no ethical 
guidelines for embryoids yet. 
He hopes embryoids aren’t 
subjected to the 14-day rule 
because they do not contain 
certain cell types, so they 
are unable to develop into a 
baby. The lab has followed 
the 14-day rule so far by only 
culturing the embryoids for 
four days, Fu said.

Six 
months 
after 
a 
previous 
Climate 
Strike 
in 
March 
culminated 
in 
10 
demonstrators 
being 
arrested after a nearly eight-
hour sit-in at the Fleming 
Administration 
Building, 
another protest is planned for 
Friday. The demonstration 
will begin at 11 a.m. on 
the Ingalls Mall outside of 
Rackham Auditorium.
Naina 
Agrawal-Hardin, 
press liaison for Washtenaw 
County 
Climate 
Strike 
and a junior at Washtenaw 
International High School, 
applauded AAPS for allowing 

students to leave class.
“While AAPS can’t legally 
encourage students to leave 
class, 
as 
organizers 
we 
are happy to see that our 
work has pushed AAPS to 
acknowledge our movement 
and the right of all students 
to be part of this historic 
moment fighting for their 
futures,” 
Agrawal-Hardin 
told The Daily. “We hope 
that in future we can work 
even more closely with AAPS 
towards 
transformative 
action on climate justice.”
Comsa said administrators 
would 
work 
to 
maintain 
order.
“In all cases, students are 
supervised, 
whether 
they 
choose to participate or not,” 

Comsa wrote. “We encourage 
all 
parents/guardians 
to 
speak with their student(s) 
about the messaging related 
to 
this 
event, 
including 
anticipated student walkouts, 
and ways in which students 
can constructively and safely 
express their viewpoints.”
Comsa 
also 
clarified 
that students are not being 
required to take part in the 
walkout.
“We will respect the rights 
of all students, whether they 
choose to participate or not,” 
Comsa said. “Thus, we work 
with our student leaders and 
coordinate supervision and 
procedures to assure student 
safety on our campuses. No 
student will be required to 

participate in any student-
led 
activities, 
including 
walkouts.”
In 
contrast, 
University 
administrators 
have 
not 
made 
any 
announcements 
excusing students and staff 
from 
classes 
during 
the 
strike. LSA freshman Porter 
Hughes created a petition 
calling on the University to 
“dismiss all students, faculty, 
staff, 
employees, 
and 
all 
other associated personnel 
during this time so that all 
who wish to participate may 
without fear of punishment 
or consequence.”
“I think the University has 
a responsibility to ensure that 
civic engagement maintains 
a core part of its mission by 

not only talking the talk but 
also by walking the walk 
and allowing people to go 
and participate in the event 
without fear of retribution 
or punishment in any way, 
shape or form,” Hughes said.
Hughes said the petition is 
meant to be sent University 
President Mark Schlissel, and 
that he’s trying to get in touch 
with other administrators as 
well. The University should 
recognize how impactful the 
climate crisis is for students 
and for their futures, Hughes 
said. 
“Climate 
change 
is 
affecting us in our everyday 
lives and is going to have an 
even bigger impact in our 
near future,” Hughes said.

Foer emphasized individual 
action is truly engineered 
toward the person and is not a 
one-size-fits-all program. He 
mentioned a plan that focuses 
on a plant-based diet and 
limited travel, saying clean 
eating was much easier than 
less travel. 
“Acknowledge and accept 

who we are, acknowledge 
what our limits are,” Foer 
said. “I find it relatively easy 
to be a vegetarian. I find it 
rather difficult to control the 
number of flights I take.” 
Regardless 
of 
what 
action someone takes, Foer 
emphasized the importance 
of taking any action at all. 
He said simply accepting the 
reality of climate change isn’t 
permissible. 
“Intellectually 
accepting 
the truth isn’t virtuous in 
and of itself, and it won’t save 
us,” Foer said. “If we accept 
the fact of the reality, that 
we are destroying the planet, 
but aren’t willing to believe it, 
we are no better than those 
who denied the existence 
of 
human-caused 
climate 
change. And when the future 
distinguishes 
between 
the 
two kinds of denial, which 
will appear to be a grave error 
and which an unforgivable 
crime?” 
Perfecto then brought up 
the instance of Puerto Rico, 
the U.S. territory devastated 
by a hurricane.
“I think that more and 
more, 
because 
of 
these 

climate 
catastrophes, 

people that didn’t know, are 
knowing, and the people that 
knew, are more compelled to 
do something,” Perfecto said. 
“Do you agree that things are 
changing?” 
Foer agreed that things are 
changing, but said he worries 
Americans 
emphasize 

resilience too much after a 
natural disaster and do not 
talk about how things are 
getting worse. 
Foer ended his discussion 
by offering up the idea of 
climate change as a chance 
to start again, rather than an 
ending.
“We 
are 
so 
used 
to 
thinking of climate change as 
endings: the end of the polar 
ice cap, the end of coastal 
cities, the end of tolerable 
weather,” Foer said. “But we 
never think about it as an 
opportunity for a beginning. 
Maybe that is the ultimate 
altercation of climate change 
is not ‘we’re doomed,’ but 
‘we’re at the beginning.’” 
LSA sophomores Natalie 
Suh and Katie Kulie are fans 
of Foer’s work and were 
pleasantly surprised by the 
event. 
“I 
had 
read 
his 
book 
‘Extremely 
Loud 
and 
Incredibly 
Close’ 
in 
high 
school, and I thought it would 
be a good opportunity to see a 
New York best-selling author 
talk,” Suh said. “I didn’t know 
what to expect, really, out 
of this. It seems so different 
from ‘Extremely Loud and 
Incredibly Close.’”
Kulie 
said 
she 
likes 
how 
Foer 
tells 
a 
story, 
acknowledging the trials and 
tribulations 
without 
being 
too depressing. 
“He’s really good at framing 
things that are traditionally 
considered super negative as 
positive, but also still being 
realistic about it, which I 
think is something that is a 
struggle,” Kulie said. “You 
don’t hear stuff like that in 
the rhetoric about climate 
change these days.” 
Both Kulie and Suh said 
they plan on attending the 
Washtenaw County Climate 
Strike Friday and hope it 
will be the beginning of real 
change. 
“I hope that the University 
of 
Michigan 
officials 
are 
listening and actually see this 
as a powerful statement and 
not just, ‘Oh, the college kids 
are at it again’ and actually pay 
attention,” Suh said. “I think if 
there is more of a diverse group 
of ages and identities, it will be 
more of an impactful statement.”

Our mentality toward saving the environment
A

s an engineer studying 
at 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan, I am relishing 
the opportunity to occasionally 
take classes that don’t require 
me to solve an equation or 
perform 
a 
calculation 
with 
only one correct answer. In my 
English class this semester, 
we are discussing what it’s 
like to write during a time of 
extinction, a topic that has been 
generally analyzed with many 
indefinite answers. In an article 
we read about the numerous 
current perils of climate change, 
journalist David Wallace-Wells 
juxtaposes his grim, pessimistic 
attitude with the optimistic 
attitude 
of 
“the 
scientists” 
he refers to. In doing so, he 
prompted the entire class to 
discuss whether or not it’s more 
reasonable to think about our 
climate 
strife 
optimistically, 
like “the scientists” do, or 
realistically, like he does. Just as 
the nature of the climate debate 
plays out, I have come to realize 
there is no definite answer 
for how we should be feeling 
toward our impending doom.
I 
don’t 
necessarily 
see 
the 
reason 
for 
projecting 
optimism toward our climate 
change 
issue 
because 
of 
the 
euphemistic 
nature 
that optimism is generally 
presented in. In sugar coating 
the facts of extreme weather 
events with evasive rhetoric, 
our leaders are doing the 
ultimate 
disservice 
to 
the 
scientific truth behind the 
natural 
disasters 
occurring 
more and more frequently. 
In naively believing we can 
reverse climate change, we 
are not accurately conveying 
the gravity of the situation 
for others to understand that 
it’s going to require more than 
just desire.
A 
common 
theme 
was 
brought 
up 
in 
our 
class 
discussion 
regarding 
the 
motivation that people have 
behind the phrase “think of 
the children.” The danger 
of 
using 
this 
phrase 
to 
justify why we should act to 
preserve our society for the 
future is the assumption that 

there will even be a future 
for our children to live in. 
We are also assuming this 
future will exist where we 
will have, unknowingly and 
distressingly, handed over the 
responsibility of the world 
to the next generation. In 
the same way, we are merely 
assuming that a sustainable 
future 
will 
exist 
without 
showing 
any 
drive, 
other 
than sheer desire, to actually 
make it happen. Approaching 
the climate issue with an 
overarching sense of optimism 
simply projects false realities 
that are most likely not as 
attainable as they are painted 
out to be.
While it may seem that, 
because 
I 
am 
opposing 
optimistic approaches, I would 
be 
completely 
supportive 
of 
realistic 
approaches, 
I 
have 
to 
acknowledge 
that 
realism 
comes 
with 
its 
own danger regarding the 
climate issue as well. The 
single 
danger 
that 
comes 
with 
being 
realistic 
about 
the fate of our environment 
is the emotional instability 
and 
overwhelming 
anguish 
we will have to face. We will 
have to accept the hard truth 
that our planet is probably 
doomed at this point and that 
an overwhelming amount of 
deaths are inevitable despite 
what we do from now on. As 
Wallace-Wells highlights, “No 
plausible program of emissions 
reductions alone can prevent 
climate disaster.” With that 
being 
said, 
approaching 
the climate issue with an 
overbearing sense of realism 
may simply be too much for us 
to endure. 
At the end of the day, I think 
“the scientists” that Wallace-
Wells 
refers 
to 
represent 
people of various professions 
who adopt an urgent attitude 
rather than an optimistic one. 
These types of people trust 
that good change can happen 
because we, as humans, are 
capable of – or are going to 
make ourselves capable of – 
figuring out a way to get us out 
of our own mess. As should be 

for all of us, they understand 
that the alternative, which 
is 
ultimately 
suffering 
extinction 
as 
a 
result 
of 
making 
our 
planet 
uninhabitable – is “simply 
unimaginable.” They know 
that we must all act together 
with urgency, because there 
is no choice but to devote 
ourselves to improving.
If the situation is as severe 
as it is, why aren’t we all 
making this the top priority 
in our lives? Why is it not a 
“have to” and is instead more 
of a “probably should?” As a 
young person in our society 
who still has the opportunity 
to choose the avenue which 
I will pursue, I worry that 
continuing to try to work 
for an improved, sustainable 
future will not be worth it. 
In her poem about the end of 
the world, Joy Harjo refers 
to the kitchen table as the 
center of life and suggests 
that the world will end with 
everyone around the table 
– when it will be too late. I 
fret about if the work that 
I have been preparing to do 
my whole life will not matter 
anymore. I am unsettled by 
the day when, after all I try 
to do to save our world, it will 
not have mattered, because 
what mattered was that all of 
us tried.
Going forward, I ask you to 
adopt a sense of urgency like 
“the scientists” have toward 
our looming climate issue. We 
need to understand that we are 
the only ones who can reverse 
this in our favor, and we 
should be urging each other 
to work towards making our 
“impossible” goals possible. 
The careers and the lives that 
we are all going to have will 
either help us get through the 
pain or help us end the root 
of that pain. As difficult as it 
may be, I urge you to reflect 
on what you’re doing to make 
this world a better place in a 
way that solves the problem 
rather than runs from it.

T

he 
notion 
of 
“electability” 
has 
played a prominent role 
in the Democratic primaries. 
Voters overwhelmingly view 
former 
Vice 
President 
Joe 
Biden as the most electable, 
and 
Biden’s 
campaign 
has 
overtly sought to position him 
as having the best chance of 
defeating 
President 
Donald 
Trump. Supporters of Sen. 
Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Sen. 
Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., 
along with many commentators 
in 
liberal 
media 
circles, 
have pushed back on Biden’s 
perceived electability, arguing 
that bold new ideas are needed 
to energize the Democratic 
base. 
Still 
others 
have 
argued that “electability” is a 
meaningless notion since no 
candidates have an identifiably 
better shot of beating Trump.
While the latter camp is 
correct in claiming it is too 
soon 
to 
make 
meaningful 
predictions about the eventual 
winner of the general election, 
careful analysis of political 
trends 
can 
yield 
relevant 
assessments of electability. The 
evidence suggests that Biden 
does indeed enjoy an advantage 
in 
electability, 
particularly 
compared 
to 
Sanders 
and 
Warren. 
However, 
this 
advantage is not necessarily for 
the reasons many assume.
Biden’s 
electability 
stems 
from his ability to appeal to 
a broad coalition including 
independents and voters who 
flipped from Barack Obama 
to Trump in 2016. In the 
aftermath of the 2016 election, 
political 
analysts 
poured 
over exit polling data and 
found a primary culprit for 
Hillary Clinton’s defeat: white, 
working-class 
voters 
who 
flipped from Barack Obama 
to Trump. These voters are 
disaffected by globalization and 
mistrustful of the government. 
They are seeking a candidate 
who appeals to their concerns. 
In the months following the 
2016 election, many political 
pundits assumed that winning 
back these voters was key to 
retaking the White House. Now, 
however, the social rhetoric 
implies the Democratic party 
should 
prioritize 
mobilizing 
the base and turning out high 
numbers of reliably Democratic 
voters, 
particularly 
young 
voters and African Americans. 
Both of these objectives are 
important, but Clinton’s defeat 
was far more complex than 
a failure to appeal to these 
demographics. 
Young 
voter 

turnout was actually higher 
in 2016 than in 2012, and 
Clinton did not significantly 
underperform 
with 
young 
voters relative to Obama in 
2012, meaning young voter 
turnout 
cannot 
adequately 
explain Trump’s surge in 2016. 
Sanders and Warren are the 
clear favorites among young 
primary voters, but I believe 
there is little evidence that 
nominating a liberal firebrand 
would 
boost 
young 
voter 
turnout enough to significantly 
affect 
the 
election. 
Young 
voter turnout has fluctuated 
somewhat 
throughout 
the 
years but has always lagged far 
behind older voters, even in the 
years 
Democrats 
nominated 
very liberal candidates like 
George McGovern or Michael 
Dukakis. This suggests that 
merely 
nominating 
a 
more 
liberal candidate is not enough 
to solve young voters’ low 
turnout as Sanders and Warren 
have implied.
African American turnout, 
on the other hand, fell sharply. 
While this could be partly due 
to Obama’s absence from the 
ballot, Democrats clearly need 
to do a better job of appealing to 
African Americans. Some have 
argued that Biden would fail to 
do so, given his gaffe-tendency 
and 
controversial 
legislative 
track 
record, 
but 
polling 
consistently shows Biden as 
the top choice among African 
American primary voters. If 
Biden cannot turn out African 
Americans 
in 
the 
general 
election, there’s little reason 
to think his primary opponents 
could do better, given that 
Biden is the demographic’s 
most-favored candidate. 
Of course, young voters and 
African Americans are not the 
only members of the Democratic 
coalition. 
Currently, 
Biden 
is the second-most favorably 
viewed candidate among all 
Democrats, behind Warren. If 
turning out the base is indeed 
key to beating Trump in 2020, 
it is difficult to see how Biden 
is in a worse position than his 
more progressive colleagues. 
Where Biden does have a 
clear edge is in appealing to 
the moderate swing voters. 
Trump won independent voters 
in 2016, but they have soured 
on his presidency and oppose 
his re-election bid by a sizable 
margin. These independents do 
not want to vote for Trump, but 
far-left policies do not appeal to 
them, and the proof is in the poll 
numbers. A majority of voters 
say they would not vote for a 

socialist, which is especially 
troubling for Sanders, who 
openly describes himself as 
a “democratic socialist.” Any 
far-left nominee would have to 
pivot back toward the center 
to avoid having the “socialist” 
label stick, and this could 
be a tall task for many of the 
candidates who have endorsed 
unpopular policies such as 
decriminalizing unauthorized 
border crossing and single-
payer health care. Biden is 
one of the few Democratic 
candidates to oppose these 
policies, which positions him 
better among moderate swing 
voters compared to his more 
liberal primary opponents.
While voters are skeptical of 
far-left policy positions, they 
routinely express support for a 
“generic Democrat,” and Biden, 
as the mainstream former 
vice-president for a popular 
former president, is arguably 
the most generic Democrat 
among the top-tier candidates. 
This helps explain why Biden 
currently leads Trump by as 
many as 15 points in head-to-
head polling, a significantly 
larger lead than those of any of 
the other candidates. This lead 
is far from a guarantee that 
Biden can beat Trump, but it’s 
an optimal position to start in 
and indicative of Biden’s broad 
appeal to voters.
Electability may seem like 
a trivial matter in a primary 
that 
has 
featured 
complex 
policy debates on health care, 
immigration 
and 
foreign 
policy, but polls routinely show 
Democratic voters believe the 
ability to beat Trump is the 
most important quality in a 
candidate. Biden’s electability 
may not be the most inspiring 
reason to support his candidacy, 
but it is nonetheless a powerful 
motivator 
for 
Democratic 
voters, and they deserve an 
honest assessment of it.
Moreover, 
the 
current 
conversation 
on 
electability 
demonstrates 
Democrats 
have not learned from 2016. 
Trump is unpopular, but the 
eventual nominee cannot rely 
solely on his unpopularity to 
win. Rather, the Democratic 
nominee must be able to build 
a broad coalition that holds 
together the entire base and 
reaches out to moderate swing 
voters. Biden offers the best 
chance of doing this, and his 
perceived electability is no 
myth.

The hidden, online world of pro-anorexia
A

s body positivity has grown 
in popularity on social 
media, 
eating 
disorders 
such as binge eating, anorexia 
nervosa 
and 
bulimia 
nervosa 
have become more understood by 
American society. Social media 
accounts and movements, like I 
Weigh, have protested the diet 
culture impeding Americans by 
criticizing society for pushing diet 
pills and fads. Instead, people are 
encouraged to value themselves 
beyond their bodies. However, while 
body positivity is clearly beneficial, 
an opposite movement still slithers 
through social media. Pro-anorexia, 
or pro-ana for short, is the online 
promotion of weight-loss eating 
disorders, mainly anorexia and 
bulimia.
Pro-ana developed with the 
internet, 
beginning 
its 
online 
presence 
in 
the 
1990s 
and 
continuing today through online 
forums, blogs and popular social 
media. However, each pro-ana 
medium is different in its approach. 
The most extreme are those who 
believe in Ana (anorexia) as a 
goddess they must worship and 
follow. There are commandments, 
prayers and creeds dangerously 
dictating how people must live 
to become a true anorexic. The 
second level are those in forums 
or social media accounts who 
believe anorexia is good, but not in 
a religious sense. For example, they 
do not worship anorexia or bulimia 
as a goddess, but they still believe in 
the disease as a lifestyle. Rules and 
tips regarding food and exercise 
are still shared to encourage 
themselves and others. Ana buddies 
are formed to motivate others 
through their fasting, purging 
and 
exercising. 
When 
rules 
are broken, pro-ana users abuse 
each other to trigger them into 
not eating. This level bleeds into 
the final one: those who have an 
eating disorder but do not see it as a 
blessing. Yet, they still take to social 
media to post “thinspirational” 
photos and quotes, using the 
websites as self-motivation to 
continue their harmful behaviors 

while simultaneously encouraging 
others to recover.
While the harm these websites 
cause is obvious, pro-ana is an 
addictive 
distraction. 
Pro-ana 
sites and blogs are a playground to 
capture vulnerable people and keep 
them in their eating disorders. The 
websites serve to justify dangerous, 
disordered behaviors and breaks 
the temptation to recover. Yet, pro-
ana is readily accessible. Finding 
pro-ana is as simple as a Google 
search, where photos of emaciated 
women pop up with accompanying 
quotes. Rhymes such as “skip 
dinner, wake up thinner” and 
“hungry to bed, hungry to rise 
makes a girl a smaller size” are 
there for anyone – including 
children – to see and become 
influenced. Furthermore, the top 
result after searching pro-ana is 
a link to the hashtag on Twitter, 
followed by pro-ana websites. With 
a simple scroll, adults and children 
can find accounts posting goal 
weights, body photos, new diets 
and tracked calories. Pro-ana is a 
treacherous world easily preying 
on the vulnerable.
Anorexia is the mental illness 
with the highest mortality rate, 
with 20 percent of the deaths being 
from suicide, but pro-ana still 
deserves to be taken as seriously 
as suicide. Consider the case of 
Michelle Carter, who was rightfully 
sentenced to 15 months in prison 
for encouraging her boyfriend to 
commit suicide. Pro-ana does the 
same but on a wider level, yet only 
Pinterest and Tumblr have banned 
the content. Even a Google search 
of pro-ana does not prompt links 
to the National Eating Disorders 
Association hotline, as it does when 
someone 
Googles 
“prosuicide.” 
Obviously, pro-ana is more sneaky 
and subtle in its suicidal ideations, 
as websites and accounts continue 
to fly under the radar. However, 
action must still be taken to make 
pro-ana harder to find, and search 
engines providing resources is an 
easy way to further prevention.
Eating disorders are painful 
and hazardous illnesses, and it is 

time search engine enterprises 
and social media companies 
treat it seriously. By allowing the 
promotion of anorexia and other 
eating 
disorders, 
companies 
become 
partially 
responsible 
for 
the 
development 
and 
continuance of such disorders. 
There is no value in allowing 
such easy access to pro-ana 
content. Especially since pro-
ana views eating disorders as 
lifestyle choices and not diseases, 
the risks of eating disorders are 
overlooked. Pro-ana validates 
and worships unhealthy, skeletal 
bodies, and it pushes people to 
slowly kill themselves through 
starving, 
purging, 
abusing 
laxatives and over exercising. 
Social media companies like 
Instagram and Twitter can join 
other companies in removing 
pro-ana 
content. 
Instagram 
has already made strides by 
banning 17 pro-ana hashtags 
in 2012, marking them against 
their terms of service, though 
this actually made the problem 
worse by encouraging alternative 
hashtags – so Instagram can do 
more. There are still more than 
250 hashtag variations open. 
With technological advancement, 
Instagram can afford a team 
to find the current hashtags 
and block them. Of course, new 
variations will form and users will 
continuously find ways to share 
content – drug addicts always find 
a dealer. But banning hashtags 
does make pro-ana harder to 
find, especially for newer viewers 
and children. Additionally, the 
recommendation algorithms can 
be reformed to screen hashtags 
before promoting them in a 
feed. Banning pro-ana content 
is time-consuming work, but it is 
necessary to help prevention of 
eating disorders and suicide.

The second day of Riot Fest began with a large blow-up cherry and 
a burgundy slip dress. The latter was donned by Cherry Glazerr’s 
always-on frontwoman, Clementine Creevy, and the former teetered 
in the background of their set. With the level of noise coming from 
each instrument, you would have expected it to pop. But no, it held up 
throughout their raucous and entertaining set, a whimsical piece of 
mythology that encapsulated the group’s ethos perfectly. Standing three 
feet from the front of the stage and the aforementioned cherry balloon, 
I was struck by a jolt of pure happiness. For the first show of Riot Fest’s 
second day, we were already off to a great start. 
Cherry Glazerr played for over an hour straight, with each band 
member thrashing to the music as Creevy’s ethereal voice carried 
through the air. I had seen them perform at Detroit’s Fillmore theatre 
in 2017, just as their star was beginning to shine in the rock scene. It 
was nice to see how they’d grown from a smaller, derivative outfit to a 
full-force group of seasoned performers. Their group is an interesting 
mix of classic punk and pop-punk influences with a lighter, almost folk-
inspired flavor. It was a natural fit for Chicago’s Riot Fest crowd, which 
was mixed in a similar way — from hardcore punkers to lighter, more 
hippie-esque festivalgoers, there was something there for everyone on 
that sunny Saturday in Douglas Park.
After dancing extremely poorly throughout the entirety of Cherry 
Glazerr’s set, I meandered across the fairgrounds and realized an artist 
I had been meaning to see was 50 feet away from where I was standing. 
That artist was upcoming rapper PROF, who is, I would say, what we 
all wanted Macklemore to be but never got from him. PROF’s set was a 
hilarious 45 minutes of him questioning why he was even playing there 
(which one could reasonably ask at a largely punk festival) and a rap 
performance that knocked it out of the park. The rapper threw water 
into the crowd, threw it on himself, bantered with his DJ and performed 
songs from his most recent album all at the same time, building a rapport 
with the crowd with every move he made. His beats were solid, his flow 
a pleasant nod to old-school. He is definitely one to watch. 

Walking soaked from PROF’s audience to the next stage, I couldn’t 
help but giggle at the wonder of it all. You could hear the battling 
basslines of multiple performers echo across the battered grass, smell 
the smoke from vapes and cigarettes mixing in the afternoon wind, 
catch the laughter of each group who had ventured back for another day. 
It was honestly delightful. What was also delightful came in the next 
hour, when I elbowed my way to the front of the crowd for glam-rock 
throwback band The Struts. Their set was a blast from the past, in the 
best way possible. 
The Struts, composed of four incredibly talented musicians in shiny 
costumes, bounced onto their stage with fervor. Frontman Luke Spiller 
was clad in a brilliant red getup reminiscent of Freddie Mercury’s early 
costumes, and the rest of the band wore similar outfits to push their 
image even further. The songs blended into one another perfectly, with 
Spiller effortlessly throwing in anecdotes between each performance 
that ultimately segued into the next song. It was great, it was hot and 
it was something that not many musicians could do in this day and age. 
If Greta Van Fleet is what happens when a band blindly copies one from 
the past, The Struts have ultimately become more than the sum of their 
influences. Parts of their set reminded the audience of Queen, of Black 
Sabbath, of the late ’70s in general — but they were themselves, not 
anyone else. The music was good, and sometimes that’s what sets you 
apart in the end. 
As the sun began to go down and lines formed at every stage to 
prepare for the mainstage headliners, an anticipatory buzz fell over the 
crowds. First, I made my way over to the Wu-Tang Clan’s performance, 
for which they were predictably late. After waiting for 20 minutes in the 
photo line, we were finally there: I couldn’t believe that I had made it one 
foot from the members of such a celebrated heritage group, but there I 
was. Joining most of the original lineup was a new addition, Ol’ Dirty 
Bastard’s son, aptly nicknamed Young Dirty Bastard. Their show was 
brilliant, if somewhat slow. But its been decades since they burst onto 
the scene, and the audience knew that. We were celebrating their genius 
while listening to it, joining the group members in a rehashing of their 
very beginnings with a full performance of their album 39 Chambers. 
The rest of the night was a blur. From running to the Slayer stage 

only to feel the literal sweat of the metal legends on my own skin in the 
photo pit, to a knockout performance from the British post-punk icons 
Bloc Party, I was riding an emotional yo-yo back and forth happily. My 
eardrums were near the brink of collapse, but the smile on my face was 
immovable, plastered across my cheeks like the Joker. I could feel the 
bass in my bones, the arms and legs of the audience members around me, 
the eyes of each performer crossing mine as I tried to get the best shots 
and sounds of the night. Though blended, my memories are fond. Those 
last two acts were a frenzied mix — sadness that I would be going home 
the next day, ecstatic joy of true togetherness. We were dancing with 
legends that night, and everyone knew that. Walking home from that 
second day at Riot Fest, my skin buzzed with the energy of everyone I 
had seen that day. I can almost feel it now.

Riot Fest day two is a sweaty, smoking punkmess

As a summer birthday baby, I’ve always felt spiritually 
connected to the Emmys — the forgotten birthday, if you will, 
of awards season. Sure, your friends tell you they’ll remember 
it when everyone is back at school, but you know the truth. 
In the same vein, everyone pretends that they’ll continue 
to respect the Emmys, but by the time the “golden girl” (the 
Academy Awards) rolls around the following spring, the 
Emmy Awards is expected to retreat back into obscurity. 
No longer. 
The TV beat has made it our mission to prove that 
television’s biggest night not only matters, but might — just 
might — be a superior night to the Oscars. After all, despite 
the annual hype surrounding the event, the Oscars always 
prove to be a gargantuan disappointment in some way: 
“Green Book” was not nominated purely as a joke? Lady 
Gaga and Bradley Cooper didn’t make love on stage?

On the other hand, with nominees including “POSE,” 
“Killing Eve” and “When They See Us,” the Emmys make the 
Oscars look like the slice of male-dominated Wonder Bread 
that it is*. Nearly every category is a close race, predisposing 
the night to be one chock-full of must-see moments. So, for 
those of you born without a crippling addiction to television, 
we, the TV beat, are to give you a brief cheat sheet on who 
to root for. Hopefully, you will exit this piece with some 
conversation points that will make you sound like the most 
cultured person in the room wherever you happen to be post-
Emmys on Monday morning. 
We’ve got a good feeling about our predictions. We’re 
about 75 percent sure that our predictions will be 100 percent 
right. 
You’re welcome.
— Ally Owens, TV Beat Editor

*The Emmys are not nearly as diverse on the production 
side as my brag would substantiate ... but for the sake of the 
argument, it’s still better than the Oscars.

Lead Actress in a Comedy Series: Julia Louis-
Dreyfus, “Veep” 
It physically pains me to have to make a choice in this 
category. Every actress nominated is a driving force of my 
favorite shows, proving time and time again that women 
are, in fact, funny, and actually are at the top of today’s 
comedy game. That being said, there is one woman on that 
list who inches above the rest, sitting atop the unreachable 
throne of Queen of Comedy that she’s been crafting for 
decades. I speak, of course, of Julia Louis-Dreyfus and her 
performance in the seventh and final season of “Veep.” 
Dreyfus bids the infamous Selina Meyer farewell in a 
season of power-hungry mania that resolves with barely 
a glimpse of regret. If her delivery of fast quips and gut-
punching insults won’t get the gold for her, the final 
prolonged stare she graces an empty Oval Office with sure 
will. 
— Samantha Della Fera, Senior Arts Editor 

Comedy Series: “Fleabag” 
The only justified way to award this category is in a six-
way tie. Trying to choose “The Good Place” over “Schitt’s 
Creek”? “Barry” over “Russian Doll”? It’s a tedious task: 
Comedy is delivering today’s best television, scoffing as we 
duel over which show is best. The underdog winner here is 
Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s glorious “Fleabag,” a dark comedy 
with talk-to-the-camera direction that makes “The 
Office” and “Parks and Recreation” look like high school 
video projects. As Waller-Bridge’s titular Fleabag grapples 
with trauma through sex and humor, she is introduced to 
a hot priest that everyone, including Fleabag herself, has 
no choice but to fall head over heels for in the most painful 
way. Once you witness the fourth wall break that will send 
a cold shock through your entire body, you too will know 
why this show should be walking home with the statue. 
— Samantha Della Fera

Lead Actor in A Drama: Billy Porter, “POSE” 
If Billy Porter is not awarded this title, you have my word 
that I will punch a hole through my Samsung television. 
Carnegie 
Mellon-educated 
and 
Broadway-trained, 
Porter’s resume already exceeds what is commonly 
expected of a “conventional” leading man in television. 

Jason Bateman, you’ll always have a place in my heart, but 
Billy simply is a stratosphere above what has been listed 
(in name only) as his competition. Even without context, 
Porter’s portrayal of Pray Tell on “POSE” could still beat 
out the most talented men in Hollywood. However, when 
you combine Porter’s raw performance ability with the 
important social work he is doing — representing the 
strength and kinship of queer-found families — you have 
to wonder, do I really need to call Saul? 
— Ally Owens 

Lead Actor in a Comedy Series: Bill Hader, “Barry”
While “Schitt’s Creek” patriarch Eugene Levy and 
Ted Danson’s demonic Michael on “The Good Place” 
are also worthy contenders for this prize, their brilliant 
performances seem almost one-note in comparison to 
Bill Hader’s as the titular hitman in “Barry.” Playing a 
character who is on a quest to put his dark past into the 
shadows in order to pursue a serendipitous acting career, 
Hader is even more impressive in the show’s second 
season, as he is forced to display a much wider range of 
emotions than the stoic, repressed and awkward version 
of the character seen in the first season. Second season 
Barry is given the ability to show development, and Hader 
juggles the inherent complexity in playing such a role with 
tremendous skill. 
— Sayan Ghosh, New Media Beat Editor 

Limited Series: “Chernobyl” 
Possibly the most stacked category of the entire 
night, the “Limited Series” title will probably be 
bestowed upon one of the largest TV phenomena of 
recent memory. I mean, how many other television 
shows can transform a destroyed nuclear site into 
a destination for influencers? Moreover, HBO’s 
“Chernobyl” doesn’t just have popularity on its 
side, but also an impressively well-crafted world 
lain before audiences by the writers, as well 
as a stellar performance by Stellan Skarsgård.

When I was younger, I fantasized about 
receiving letters. Not just any letters — 
letters from myself in the future. In these 
letters, future Sarah would chronologize my 
milestones and regrets. The information could 
be anything from a tip on an upcoming exam 
(I’m looking at you, physiology) or a clue about 
who I will marry. What could I do with that 
knowledge? Would I even believe it? While 
characters in Keigo Higashino’s “Miracles of 
the Namiya General Store” don’t get letters 
from themselves, they do get letters from the 
future. 
“Miracles of the Namiya General Store” 
follows a series of interconnected vignettes, 
each telling a touching tale about a specific 
character’s internal conflicts with Mr. Namiya 
and his letters. Before the Namiya General 
Store had its time travel capabilities, it was 
simply a mom-and-pop shop with an old man 
as its owner. At the beginning, the letters and 
their responses weren’t serious at all. In fact, 
they would be most aptly dubbed as riddles. 
People would stop by the Namiya General Store 
and drop the letters off in a little milk crate. At 
5:30 a.m. each morning, Mr. Namiya would get 
up, read through the letters and post his reply.

“Tell me how I can get an A+ on a test without 
studying or cheating on anything,” one visitor 
writes in “The Miracles.” And Mr. Namiya 
responds with, “Ask your teacher to test you 
on yourself. Since you’re the topic of the test, 
whatever you say will be correct.” 
These 
silly 
prankster-like 
questions, 
however, were soon replaced with serious 
questions. Instead of dismissing these letters, 

Mr. Namiya slaved over thoughtful replies. 
Halfway through the work, Mr. Namiya 
eventually dies on September 13th. Each year, 
however, on the anniversary of his death, time 
stops at the Namiya General Store. Whoever 
stumbles by has the ability to communicate 
with people in the past. We don’t learn of 
the Namiya General’s backstory until we’re 
halfway through the novel. Instead, the novel 
is framed by a set of three teenage delinquents 
— Kohei, Atsuya and Shota — who happen by the 
Namiya General Store by chance. Interestingly 
enough, the three boys take on the role Mr. 
Namiya once filled and earnestly answer the 
letters that file through the milk crate. 
It’s easy to fall into the trap of tedium with a 
structure like the vignettes of “The Miracles.” 
Each chapter is like another exposition: new 
setting, new characters and new conflict. 
I initially worried that I would dread each 
chapter, hoping to return to familiar characters 
like Kohei, Atsuya and Shota. Thankfully, this 
is never the case. Each story is singular and 
surprisingly touching. One follows the story 
of a man with the pseudonym of “Floundering 
Musician” who struggles between his duty to 
the family business or following his dream 
to pursue a career in music. Another is of 
an Olympic fencer named “Moon Rabbit” 
who oscillates between taking care of her 
terminally ill partner or throwing her all into 

her training. 
Like the letters sent to Mr. Namiya, some 
stories are hilarious. Others are heavy, delving 
deep into familial problems that had me 
fighting tears. Keigo Higashino proves to be a 
masterful storyteller, demonstrating expertise 
outside of his traditional crime and mystery 
novels. As always, I’m eager for his next 
translated work.

It’s interesting to me how the “love letter” analogy is tossed 
around by critics. Sometimes, it’s called for. Hanif Abdurrqib 
writes a love letter to A Tribe Called Quest in “Go Ahead in 
the Rain.” Damian Chazelle writes a love letter to Los Angeles 
in “La La Land.” Other times, however, it can be used to justify 
disfigurations of love and, untimately, conceal their harm. 
Recently, it has been invoked in misguided praise of Quentin 
Tarantino’s three-hour, mostly meandering but ultimately 
vindictive opus, “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.”
The film does not exactly have a premise; rather, it drifts from 
(white) Hollywood figure to figure. Instead of a liberating drift, 
though, these lengthy, indulgent scenes mire each character in 
discomfiting fantasies of their director. Tarantino’s Sharon Tate 
(Margot Robbie, “I, Tonya”) is a ditzy starlet who goes to a theater 
and enjoys watching herself play the sexist part she got in a movie. 
Tarantino’s Bruce Lee (Mike Moh, “Empire”) gets his ass kicked 
by a white, widowed stunt man (Brad Pitt, “Deadpool 2”), and it’s 
extra vindicating because Tarantino portrays Lee as a boastful, 
overrated martial artist. Did I say widower? The stunt man, Cliff 
Booth, is also suspected of killing his wife, but she was rude to 
him in a flashback, so Tarantino’s justice is that the stunt man 
probably got to take out his wife for free.
Still, this is a Tarantino film, so instead of even looking for a 
premise, let’s instead call it his “excuse for a violent climax.” In 
“Once Upon a Time,” that excuse is the haphazard interweaving 
of the Manson Family, partway into the backdrop, partway into 
the secondary cast. In a single scene that contains the violence 
Tarantino usually seems to prefer to distribute more evenly 
throughout his films, the two stars of the film, Booth and Rick 
Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio, “The Revenant”), are attacked by 

Manson Family members, but in Tarantino’s reimagining — 
complete with death-by-flamethrower — the (white) Hollywood 
guys win. That seems to be the ultimate, gruesome and vindictive 
point Tarantino is making. What does that leave the audience 
with, or Hollywood with, aside from a lust for violence and the 
unchecked ways of Hollywood’s past?
I don’t know if Hollywood wants to be avenged, and even less 
sure that it needs to be avenged. What it needs much more than 
vindication or even love is renewal. “Once Upon a Time” doesn’t 
offer that, or anything more than its director’s problematic 
fantasies.

— Julianna Morano

Over the course of my time at The Daily, I’ve reviewed a lot 
of lower quality Netflix films. As cringe-inducing and painful as 

some of these new releases about high school antics and poorly 
executed heists can be, I would opt to watch them all on repeat 
if it meant erasing the trainwreck that was “Once Upon a Time 
in Hollywood” from my memory. I’ve always prided myself on 
the fact that I’ve never walked out of a theater in the middle of 
a movie. Watching “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood” was the 
first time I wish I did. No amount of over-buttered popcorn or 
Twizzlers could have amended my movie-going experience.
Despite having two dynamite, A-list actors at his disposal, 
Tarantino’s picture flounders. As a former die-hard (now tempered) 
Leonardo Dicaprio fan, you can imagine my disappointment when 
his character, Rick Dalton, turns out to be a dull paperdoll of a 
man. A reflection of the movie as a whole, Dalton is straight up 
boring, minimally developed and has no real chemistry with his 
co-star Brad Pitt. I get that the late ’60s music, street children 
and druggie vibes were reminiscent of a romanticized decade, 
but that sort of nostalgia simply is not enough to carry a whole 
film. I’d perk up at every glimpse of a turning point, only to be let 
down again and again when no forward momentum was maide. 
I’m traditionally a fan of Tarantino’s non-linear filming style, but 
there are far too many pieces in “Once Upon a Time” left not only 
unconnected, but permanently unresolved.

If you’re going to make a mind-numbingly boring movie, at 
least have the courtesy to make it brief. “Once Upon a Time in 
Hollywood” spans close to three hours. And we are aware of 
every minute passing (really though, I checked my phone more 
times than I’m proud to admit). If you have intentions of seeing 
Tarantino’s latest flick, tread lightly. The sea of rave reviews 
deceived me, and you may fall destined for a similar fate.

— Samantha Nelson

Rarely do I change my opinion on a movie. While that may 
not be the most constructive way to critique films, it’s honest. 
My gut reaction to “Once Upon a Time” was total disinterest. I 
found the first two hours of the film to be unbelievably boring, to 
a degree that completely shocked me. I’ve felt a lot of things while 
watching films by Quentin Tarantino, but never boredom. The last 
act of the film, which has been praised for its shock and audacity, 
entertained me in the moment, but left me feeling “so what” by the 
time the credits rolled.
I’m about to sound hypocritical given I just said I don’t often 
change my views on movies, but “Once Upon a Time” has caused 
me to re-evaluate my entire relationship with Quentin Tarantino. 
As a young adult I loved his films. I thought they were funny, 
clever and exciting. But that feeling of “so what” that haunted 
me after I watched an alternative history in which Sharon Tate is 
never killed and the Manson murders never happen slowly began 
to extend to the rest of the Tarantino canon. You can make movies 
where Jews get to kill Hitler and Jamie Foxx gets to shoot up racist 
slave owners. But so what? Yeah, it would be nice if a lot of the 
bad shit that’s happened over the course of world history didn’t 
happen. But it did. I’m still working through what that means; 
more specifically, that I don’t think Tarantino movies “mean” 
anything. Maybe that’s fine. Maybe just being entertaining is 
enough. But in an increasingly complicated world, I don’t know 
how much room we still have to enjoy uncomplicated catharsis.

I get that the late ’60s 
music, street children 
and druggie vibes 
were reminiscent 
of a romanticized 
decade, but that sort 
of nostalgia simply is 
not enough to carry a 
whole film.

When I had the opportunity to see “Wicked” on 
Broadway again this summer, I didn’t expect the 
piece to strike me differently than my previous 
viewings. My preconceived thought: Once you 
learn all the lyrics, have a vague awareness of 
the blocking and have each costume memorized 
there’s no room for surprise, right? Wrong. 
“Wicked” is more than a tourist attraction and an 
entertaining spectacle — it is a call to action. 
I used to leave the Broadway smash hit out of my 
favorite musical list whenever someone asked. It 
felt cliché for someone who loves musical theatre 
as much as I do to admit that my favorite musical 
isn’t some niche, hipster, singer-songwriter 
Broadway musical that nobody has ever heard of. 
“Wicked” is the story of the land of Oz before 
Dorothy and the yellow brick road. It follows 
brazen, emerald skinned Elphaba, an astute, 
misunderstood young woman sent to boarding 
school to look after her sister, wheelchair-bound 
Nessarose. In an unlikely turn of events, she falls 
into a friendship with bubbly girly-girl Glinda 
and the two go on a journey together through 
the world as they know it, working for the world 
Elphaba hopes Oz will become. “Wicked” is a 
whirlwind of emotions and manages to land 
humor, heartbreak, feminism and friendship all 
within the span of two hours and 45 minutes. It 
is also the first Broadway show that ever left me 
speechless — a difficult feat to accomplish. 
The first time I saw the show was in 2006 with 
my mother in Philadelphia. At the age of seven, I’d 
been exclusively listening to the CD soundtrack 
since I’d received it for Christmas. We drove to 
Philadelphia and played the soundtrack twice 
through on our way there, singing along and 
swapping roles in our two-woman production. I 
can’t remember the experience of seeing the show, 
but I remember walking to the bathroom with my 
mom after the curtain call. She was sobbing. The 
piece had emotionally affected my mother, a 33 
year old woman, to the point of tears, and I didn’t 
understand if they stemmed from sadness or from 
wonder. Afterward, I asked her if I was Elphaba 
or Glinda, hoping she’d tell me I was the beautiful 
blonde with the sparkly bubble and pink glittering 

gowns. Instead, she told me I was Elphaba: smart, 
fearless, brave and filled with heart. As a seven 
year old concerned mostly with exterior image, I 
was disappointed that my mother didn’t see me as 
the “popular” good witch whom everyone adored. 
When I saw it most recently this July, 14 
years later, I brought new experiences and 
pieces of my ever forming identity with me. 
“Wicked” revealed itself as my favorite musical — 
unabashedly, without a shadow of a doubt. In its 
simplest reading, “Wicked” is about a young girl 
who does not fit into a society because she looks 
different than the majority. When you look past 
the dazzling production numbers, immaculate 
set and intricate costumes, the plight of Elphaba 
can be compared to the wider sociopolitical 
sphere in the United States and our individual 
stories as well. In the Gershwin theatre this July, 
in a country where slews of racist, homophobic, 
xenophobic and sexist things happened just that 
day, I realized the necessity and urgency under 
the glamour of this piece of theatre.
“Wicked” is about love, yes, a heterosexual 
relationship between a cisgender man and a 
cisgender woman. But it is about more than that. 
It is about a female friendship, a friendship that 
pushes itself to the limits and almost flounders 
more than once. The book is genius as it sets 
up Elphaba and Glinda to careen into the catty 
stereotype of fighting over a man, a common 
trope both on stage and in film. But instead of this 
man, Fiyero, destroying their relationship and 
showcasing both leading ladies as airy half shells 
of female characters, his character is a device in 
making their friendship a feminist relationship. 
Glinda urges Fiyero to leave her to be with 
Elphaba. She does this because she recognizes 
that her love for Fiyero pales in comparison to her 
desire for both Elphaba and Fiyero to be happy. 
Her mature choice to walk away from Fiyero so 
that her best friend can be happy and pursue her 
dreams makes her the hero of the story. In Glinda 
I see my mother, I see all of the female friends who 
have put me before themselves, I see the women 
who have become my sisters, who have changed 
my life for good. 

A most ‘Wicked’ summer

In loss to Notre Dame, Michigan 
shows signs of improvement

Trailing by one point in the 
fifth and final set, the Michigan 
volleyball team watched as a 
Notre Dame serve sailed into the 
corner, seemingly headed out of 
bounds — giving the Wolverines 
a chance to extend the set at 
least two more serves.
That hope quickly faded as 
the shot barely landed inbounds, 
earning the Fighting Irish (7-2) 
a 15-13 win in the set and a 3-2 
win in the match — sending 
Michigan (6-3) home empty-
handed despite holding a 2-1 set 
lead early on.
In the deciding set, the 
Wolverines battled back from 
an 11-8 deficit to tie the score at 
13 apiece. Ultimately, however, 
Notre Dame toughed out a kill 
and then the aforementioned 
service ace to seal Michigan’s 
fate.
“To me, I don’t look at it like 
the final plays are any more 
important than the first ones,” 
Michigan coach Mark Rosen 

said. “The first plays are just 
as important as the last ones. I 
don’t think it’s any different than 
what happened in the middle of 
the set or what happened in any 
set.”
Before falling in the final 
set, Michigan appeared to have 
the momentum after taking 
two straight set wins. After 
dropping the first set, 25-23, the 
Wolverines saw senior outside 
hitter Sydney Wetterstrom net 
four consecutive kills in the 
second frame to outlast the 
Fighting Irish and secure a 29-27 
win to deadlock the match at one 
game apiece.
In 
the 
following 
set, 
Wetterstrom scored an ace to 
put Michigan up 6-1 early, and 
the Wolverines capitalized on 
two Notre Dame errors to go up 
one game.
“(Wetterstrom) 
was 
great 
today,” 
Rosen 
said. 
“She’s someone who’s really 
experienced and brings a lot of 
personality and fire to the team.”
In the fourth set, Michigan 
found itself ahead 22-20, but lost 

the set after the Fighting Irish 
scored five of the set’s final six 
points. Even though his team 
wasn’t able to pull out a win late, 
Rosen saw improvement from 
his squad.
“We worked really hard the 
last ten days to get better at (some 
of our weaker areas),” he said. 
“Tonight we were significantly 
better. Unfortunately, it wasn’t 
quite enough, but at the same 
time that’s part of the growing 
process.”
The Wolverines won’t have 
to wait long to see the Fighting 
Irish again, as the two teams will 
meet at Crisler Center on Sunday 
afternoon for the second game of 
a home-and-home series. Rather 
than focusing on the task at 
hand, though, Rosen is instead 
looking for his players to focus 
more on their own growth over 
the past ten days.
“Our growth in the last 10 
days has been really significant,” 
Rosen said. “And that’s what 
we focused on: are we getting 
better, are we improving, are 
there areas we can improve on?”

Sitting 
there 
Wednesday, 
watching practice, you couldn’t 
tell anything had changed.
The motions were the same. 
The drills. The pace. The 
intensity. 
But something was different. 
There was no Mel Pearson in 
skates with a stick watching 
over 
practice. 
No 
assistant 
coaches. Just the players led by 
their captains.
During the preseason, the 
NCAA mandates teams have 
two days off from practicing. 

On one of the days, optional 
practice can be held, but no 
coaches are allowed time on 
the ice. During these practices, 
responsibility 
for 
keeping 
the intensity falls upon the 
shoulders of the four letter 
wearers — the captain, senior 
forward Will Lockwood, and 
his three classmates, alternate 
captains 
defenseman 
Luke 
Martin, 
defenseman 
Griffin 
Luce and forward Jake Slaker.
“Really (the) goal is if you 
guys are just watching practice, 
we don’t want anyone to be able 
to tell that there are coaches, 
that there aren’t coaches,” said 

Martin.
The 
occasional 
preseason 
captains’ 
practice 
isn’t 
the 
only 
time 
these four have 
the opportunity 
to lead practice. 
From 
May 
to 
August, captains 
lead on and off-
ice 
workouts, 
too. 
However, 
they 
aren’t 
completely left in the dark. The 
coaching staff, though aren’t 
able to get directly involved, 

provide the players with all the 
things they need to successfully 
imitate 
the 
day-to-day 
conditions 
the 
coaches 
foster. 
Scribbling 
instructions on 
a sheet of paper 
and 
passing 
them 
to 
the 
captains, 
the 
coaches 
leave 
the rest in the 
players’ hands.
It’s ultimately up to the 
captains to make sure the 
drills are being done right. Not 
running too short, not running 
too long. And most importantly, 
making sure the intensity is 
there.
“There’s a lot of us just 
pushing ourselves and pushing 
each other,” said Slaker. “We’re 
twenty, twenty-four, twenty-
three years old, so we gotta 
push each other. We’re adults 
now, we don’t have to have a 
coach on the ice every time we 
get better.” 
The hyperfocus on intensity 
levels stems from the hope to 
mirror game conditions. In 
a game, the physical play is 
upped. The speed. The stakes. 
Treating practice like a game 
can help the team prepare for 
those tough moments faced in 
the season like holding a lead in 
a close game or finding the back 
of the net to break a tie.
As for how the four captains 
go about keeping the intensity, 
the 
styles 
vary. 
Lockwood 
strives to lead by example and 
set the bar high for the younger 
players so they know what’s 
expected of them. Martin takes 
a more vocal approach.
“It’s fun to sort of lead the 
pace,” Martin said. “To be the 
couple voices that are pushing 
guys. Like I said we’re really not 
going out there and just going 
through the motions. We’re 
really getting something out of 
it and getting better every day.”
And the progress of the 

players in the practices doesn’t 
go unmonitored.
Normally 
during 
a 
captains’ 
practice, 
the 
coaches 
catch 
brief 
glimpses 
from 
the 
mezzanine level 
of Yost. 
Though 
unable 
to 
sit 
among the other 
coaches due to 
obligations to attend the Big 
Ten coaches meeting, Pearson 
made sure to check in. He 
called up Lockwood to check 
in. Mel asked if he had any 
advice, opinions or thoughts 
on the drills he’d left for them 
to do.
The most notable comment 
Lockwood offered up about the 
skate? The intensity.
But 
even 
with 
all 
the 
emphasis placed on intensity 
by the captains, Martin admits 
there’s still a slight turbulence 

transitioning between the 
summer sessions and practicing 
with the coaches.
“It’s 
different,” 
Martin said. “It’s 
just higher pace. 
Everything’s just 
quicker … But it’s 
really good to be 
back. Obviously 
these 
first 
couple 
weeks 
are 
all 
about 
just 
grinding 
through, but at the same time 
just trying to stay as fresh as 
you can. It’s a long season.”
But with just seventeen days 
laying between the Wolverines 
and their season opener against 
Windsor, there’s no time to be 
wasted. And they’re full speed 
ahead, whether coaches are 
allowed to be at practice or not.
“... Because, really, if you 
need the coach to push you, this 
probably isn’t the right program 
for you,” Martin said. “You 
should be pushing yourself.”

Wolverine captains, Will Lockwood, Luke Martin, Griffin Luce and Jake Slaker, hope to set the tone early in the year

ALEC COHEN/Daily
Senior defenseman Luke Martin serves as one of the alternate captains on this year’s Michigan hockey team.

In victory, all ‘M’ needs is one goal

Some wins only take one goal. 
In the first 10 minutes of 
the Michigan women’s soccer 
team’s game against No. 23 Penn 
State (4-4-1 overall, 0-1-0 Big 
Ten), junior midfielder Sarah 
Stratigakis passed the ball to 
sophomore midfielder Meredith 
Haakenson. 
Haakenson 
capitalized on the opportunity 
and fired a shot into the upper 
right corner of the net — scoring 
the only goal of the game as the 
Wolverines won, 1-0. 
Michigan 
(6-2-0, 
1-0-0) 
started 
strong 
in 
Thursday 
night’s match. The Wolverines 
took the first shot of the game 
in the 5th minute, aiming at the 
bottom left corner of the goal, but 
the Nittany Lions’ goalkeeper 
Amanda Dennis denied it. This 
near miss bolstered Michigan’s 
determination and ultimately 
helped the team score minutes 
later. 
“They came out with really 
good energy at the start of the 
game,” said Michigan coach 
Jennifer Klein. “That helped 
them put the ball in the back of 
the net.”

This initial enthusiasm soon 
faded. Haakenson’s goal marked 
the Wolverines’ last shot for the 
first half. After they showed up 
on the scoreboard, Penn State 
dominated the rest of the half. 
The Nittany Lions then made six 
attempts on target. 
“We’re playing against Penn 
State. That’s an incredible team 
with a tactical strategy,” Klein 
said. “It’s a credit to Penn State 
we weren’t able to make any 
more shots.”
Junior 
goalkeeper 
Hillary 
Beall led Michigan’s defensive 
effort and allowed the team to 
hang onto the lead. She made 
three saves, including a key save 
in the final 10 minutes of the 
match to secure the win.
“We continue to improve 
defensively,” Klein said. “They 
stuck 
together 
and 
blocked 
shots. 
Hilliary 
Beall 
made 
incredible saves, and she played 
fantastically. 
She 
had 
great 
footwork and was able to push 
the ball out.”
At the start of the second 
half, the Wolverines’ offensive 
struggles seemed to persist. The 
Nittany Lions came out strong 
and had a shot within the first 

30 seconds. But Michigan soon 
found the energy it opened the 
game with. Minutes later, the 
Wolverines began pressuring 
again. They made an impressive 
six attempts on goal during the 
second half — double the amount 
of Penn State. They didn’t 
convert any but kept the ball 
away from the Nittany Lions and 
out of their goal.
“Each half had momentum 
that shifted back and forth. 
You get that ebb and flow with 
two quality teams. That’s what 
makes a good soccer game,” 
Klein said. “In the second half, 
we were able to take more shots 
and make them have to deal with 
us more.” 
Michigan 
dominated 
the 
second half and prevented Penn 
State from making it on the 
scoreboard. 
The 
Wolverines 
proved that sometimes, it only 
takes one goal to be victorious. 

“Preparation 
and 

commitment to the game plan 
helps us perform well and 
focus,” Klein said. “It’s how we 
get results. We will continue to 
focus and prepare for each game. 
We have hopes of winning the 
Big Ten Championships.”

are all about 
just grinding...

Once dreaming of Wisconsin, the Bredeson brothers found a home

Jack Bredeson remembers 
the routine perfectly.
Every 
Saturday 
morning 
in the fall, his high school 
football team would wake up 
sore from the previous night’s 
game and go straight into a 
two-hour lifting session at 8 
a.m. Arrowhead High School 
in Hartland, Wis. was 30 
minutes west of Milwaukee. 
Or, more importantly, an hour 
east of Madison.
Because seven Saturdays in 
the fall, that’s where Jack and 
Ben Bredeson raced to.
As soon as lifts ended, half 
of their team changed as fast 
as possible, piled in a car and 
sped up to Camp Randall in 
time for 11 a.m. kickoff.
“That’s just what you did,” 
Jack said. “You went to Badger 
football games, you grew up 
Badger fans. It was awesome.”
So before Ben became a 
two-time 
All-Big 
Ten 
left 
guard at Michigan and before 
Jack’s four years as pitcher for 
the Wolverines’ baseball team, 
Camp Randall was the dream.
The conscious part was 
that they would play football 
together 
— 
Ben 
on 
the 
offensive line and Jack at 
defensive end, where he played 
in high school. Wisconsin was 
just the world they came from.
“All Ben and I knew growing 
up was Wisconsin, Wisconsin, 
Wisconsin,” Jack said.
Five years later, Ben is 
careful to note that coming 
to Michigan was not a joint 
decision. Going to college 
together 
was 
a 
childhood 
dream, but once the recruiting 
process became real, that 
dream dissipated, with each 
of their personal paths leading 
them to Michigan separately.
“Everyone likes to make it 
this big deal in my recruiting 
process,” Ben told The Daily 
this week. “It really was not. 
He was excited for me to come 

here cause it’s where I wanted 
to come. And when I say that, 
a lot of people don’t believe 
me. But we were raised by the 
same parents, with the same 
values, in the same house and 
it’s really no surprise that we 
both value the things that 
Michigan has to offer.”
Still, playing sports together 
was an integral part of each of 
their childhoods, even before 
football entered both of their 
lives in eighth grade. Their 
dad, Mike, played center at 
Illinois State in the 1980s, but 
didn’t see the point of his sons 
playing football before middle 
school.
So instead, Mike used his 
skills as a home builder to 
build a full hockey rink in 
the 
Bredesons’ 
backyard, 
complete with full boards 
and everything. On their local 
travel team, Ben played up a 

year so he could be in Jack’s 
age group.
“Those are probably the 
best memories of childhood 
sports we have is just messing 
around on the ice rink,” Jack 
said. “You go down there 
every night until your toes are 
frozen and you come back.”
The 
timing 
worked 
out 
perfectly. Ben got too big for 
hockey right as football gave 
him and Jack another sport to 
play together.
Once Ben grew out of hockey, 
football became his primary 
focus. For a time, Jack thought 
it would be his too. With their 
positions naturally lining up 
across from each other every 
day at practice, fights between 
the two became so common 
that coaches banned them 
from matching up with one 
another.
“Lot of cheap shots,” Jack 

said. “Lot of awkward rides 
home from practice.”
But 
sometime 
mid-way 
through Jack’s junior year 
of high school, he decided 
he would be playing baseball 
in college. And with that 
decision, a pair of dreams 
died. The brothers wouldn’t be 
football teammates in college, 
as they had always talked 
about. And they wouldn’t be 
going to Wisconsin together, 
as they had always assumed, 
because the Badgers don’t 
have a baseball program.
For a year, as Ben — a 
heavily-recruited four-star — 
learned about college football 
beyond 
Camp 
Randall, 
it 
seemed that Jack’s senior year 
of high school would be their 
last together.
Then came Jim Harbaugh.
“Once 
they 
made 
the 
Harbaugh signing (in Ben’s 

junior) year of high school, 
that’s 
when 
things 
really 
changed and where Michigan 
kinda blew up the charts for 
him and passed a couple other 
schools,” Jack said. “So once 
that happened, I guess the 
dream and hope of going to 
school together became more 
of a reality again.”
Before Ben even made his 
official visit in November 
of his senior year, he was 
committed. The official visit 
was a mere formality, mixed 
in with casual trips down to 
Ann Arbor to see Jack and go 
to games.
“When I came out and saw 
Jack, just his personality, he 
likes to run the show,” Ben 
said. “So he was taking us all 
around Ann Arbor showing 
us — he’d been here for two 
months but it seemed like 
he’d been here for two years. 

And he did an outstanding 
job and made me excited and 
reassured my choice of coming 
here.”
For the next three years, 
neither missed a home game 
for the other. If the baseball 
team 
was 
at 
home, 
Ben 
would finish practice, walk 
across the parking lot from 
Schembechler Hall to Ray 
Fisher Stadium and watch his 
brother pitch.
Last summer required a 
slightly longer trip — 10 hours 
to the College World Series 
in 
Omaha, 
Neb. 
Between 
summer classes and offseason 
workouts, Ben only made it out 
for the last two games, but as 
he drove across Illinois and 
Iowa, emotions took over.
“It’s the last baseball game 
he’ll ever play and just how 
many hundreds of baseball 
games I’ve gone to see him 
play,” Ben said. “And I was 
going to go to the final one. 
It was just a very emotional 
moment for both of us and just 
kind of surreal. Like it really 
hadn’t hit me at the time that 
that chapter of his life was 
going to be over. But I’m happy 
that I was able to catch every 
single one that I did.”
Jack’s back home now in 
Hartland, 
catching 
up 
on 
lost time with their younger 
brother, Max. This weekend, 
the whole family will pack into 
Camp Randall, just as Jack 
and Ben did in high school, 
only wearing different colors.
By now, Ben’s well-versed 
in talking about Wisconsin. 
Every year around this time, 
the 
inevitable 
questions 
arise about his past and the 
decision that took him across 
Lake Michigan. But as he talks 
about Jack and what Michigan 
gave them, his voice still 
cracks a little, even four years 
later.
“Those last three years 
when he and I were here were 
the best three years of my 
life.”

Runyan’s return a boost to O-Line

Jon Runyan and Ben Bredeson 
sit next to each other in every 
meeting. They practice together 
and have started 13 games next 
to each other on the offensive line 
as the left tackle and left guard. 
At 7:30 on Wednesday morning, 
they were together with offensive 
line coach Ed Warinner, watching 
film.
But for the Michigan football 
team’s first two games this 
season, Bredeson took his normal 
spot on the line while Runyan 
sat and watched, out with an 
undisclosed 
injury. 
Instead, 
Bredeson played next to redshirt 
freshman tackle Ryan Hayes, 
who is talented but inexperienced 
and hadn’t developed the same 
level of trust with Bredeson. 
But Runyan is expected to be 
back this week, just in time for 
a marquee matchup with No. 13 
Wisconsin.
“Jon and I played with each 
other now going on year two and 
he and I just know everything that 
the other’s gonna do, a telepathic 
sense of it just from being next 
to the guy for so long,” Bredeson 
said. “He’s got that experience 
level for a Big Ten road game that 
we’re about to go into, so it’ll be 
nice getting Jon back. I’m excited 

for that.”
In games, offensive linemen 
— who are just feet away from 
opponents waiting to maul them 
— opt not to use full sentences 
to communicate. So instead, 
Bredeson and Runyan have a type 
of code, little words and non-
verbal signs they use to talk to 
each other in-game.
This weekend, that will be 
especially 
important. 
Camp 
Randall Stadium is the kind of 
place where the noise can suck the 
life out of you. Communication is 
vital — especially since Warinner 
noted that communication wasn’t 
always there when Bredeson 
and junior center Cesar Ruiz 
committed 
multiple 
false 
start penalties against Middle 
Tennessee and Army. And that’s 
an area where Runyan can make 
a big difference.
“They know they have to rely 
on each other for everything 
on that side, it’s like a pilot 
and a co-pilot,” Warinner said. 
“Their whole life is intertwined 
four hours a day or whatever. 
They hang out off the field, and 
so I think that just trust and 
confidence. And they had a good 
run together last year, and I think 
they’re excited about getting that 
rolling again.”
On 
Wednesday, 
Warinner 
detailed what it takes to win the 

line of scrimmage against a team 
like the Badgers. It starts with 
preparation, watching the film 
and knowing the schemes. The 
Wolverines will have to make sure 
they’re in top shape physically 
to match Wisconsin’s intensity 
and play a full four quarters 
instead of starting slow, as they 
have a tendency to do. And they 
already know they’ll have to be 
able communicate in front of tens 
of thousands of rowdy fan who 
decidedly aren’t on their side.
Warinner has faith in the 
offensive line to do just that.
“We had our best practice 
yesterday since we started in 
August, 
without 
question,” 
Warinner said. “And so that’s 
encouraging because with the bye 
week, we had a little extra time to 
work on those guys and so I think 
our guys are very confident in what 
they’re doing and they’re doing it 
with a great demeanor.”
And Runyan’s return brings 
more than just his chemistry with 
Bredeson. Runyan earned All-Big 
Ten honors last year, and he brings 
talent, experience and veteran 
presence that could be a boon to the 
offensive line. When asked about 
how Ryan Hayes could factor into 
the rotation in the future, Warinner 
gave an answer that spoke volumes.
“We’ll work through that,” he 
said, “after the Jon Runyan era.”

FOOTBALL BEAT PREDICTS

It’s a close game dominated by two of the best defenses in the 
country, but Michigan doesn’t quite have its offensive wrinkles 
ironed out, and the home team pulls it out.

Michigan’s offense is too talented to not figure it out, even if Donovan 
Peoples-Jones is still sitting. And, as we saw last year, Wisconsin 
isn’t dynamic enough to take advantage of Michigan’s secondary.

Something tells me if this game is in November, we’re having a far 
different conversation. But it’s not — and this Michigan offense 
has too many questions right now to go win a tough conference 
game in a hostile environment.

This offense isn’t ready to go on the road against a defense of Wis-
consin’s caliber yet. The Wolverines come out of Madison with their 
season undergoing re-evaluation.
