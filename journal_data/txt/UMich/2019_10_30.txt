Earlier this month, when 
California passed its Fair Pay 
to Play Act, allowing college 
athletes to profit off their 
name, 
image 
and 
likeness 
starting in 2023, mum was 
the word among Michigan’s 
football players.
The would-be beneficiaries 
generally claimed ignorance. 
Some, like senior left tackle 
Jon Runyan Jr., were more 
forthcoming, 
saying 
they 
understand why some would 
benefit from the extra money 
that would come with the bill.
On Tuesday night, hours 
after the NCAA’s Board of 
Directors voted to start moving 
its rules towards becoming 
consistent with the California 
law, there was little ambiguity 
in the response.
“Everybody’s 
getting 
richer,” said senior cornerback 
Lavert Hill. “We need a piece 
of the pie, too, I guess. That’s 

about it.”
The 
NCAA’s 
vote 
shouldn’t 
be 
mistaken 
for 
actual legislation or action. 
The 
organization, 
which 
threatened to sue over the 
California law when it was 
passed, merely signaled more 
openness to the idea. That’s 
not nothing, but it’s not paying 
athletes.
In a statement released 
Tuesday, 
the 
NCAA 
said 
that 
rule 
changes 
could 
occur immediately, but with 
guidelines that include keeping 
much of the current system 
intact.
“I don’t really know what 
the NCAA is really proposing,” 
said 
fifth-year 
senior 
linebacker Jordan Glasgow. 
“Just saying that we’re gonna 
get money based off of our 
likeness is pretty ambiguous. 
Do I feel like some people need 
more, possibly, to sustain a 
good lifestyle? Probably, yeah. 
But it’s difficult for me to say at 
this moment.”

A group of seven students and 
community members gathered 
silently outside of McDonald’s 
on Plymouth Rd. Tuesday in 
protest 
against 
the 
fast-food 
chain’s history of cruelty to 
chickens. The protest was hosted 
by the University of Michigan’s 
Michigan Animal Respect Society 

as part of The Humane League’s 
Student Alliance for Animals.
This 
week, 
The 
Humane 
League is holding a national 
Halloween week of action to put 
pressure on fast-food chains and 
other companies to adopt more 
sustainable and ethical practices. 
MARS joined student groups 
across the country in the “I’m 
Not Lovin’ It” campaign aimed at 
McDonald’s and the mistreatment 
of chickens in their supply chain.

Art & Design senior Sam 
Plouff, president of MARS, helped 
organize 
Tuesday’s 
protest. 
Plouff said MARS worked in 
conjunction with The Humane 
League to urge McDonald’s to 
implement more ethical animal 
treatment methods, especially 
since other fast-food chains have 
begun to listen to consumer 
demand on the topic. 
“We’re 
just 
looking 
for 
(McDonald’s) to improve on their 

standards, because they are a 
leader in the food industry and 
usually things that they improve 
on are usually pushed in other 
aspects of the industry,” Plouff 
said. “They’re actually behind a 
lot of other big food services right 
now. Wendy’s, Starbucks, Subway, 
all of them have adopted better 
animal welfare standards in the 
last few years and McDonald’s 
has really been lagging.”

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-NINE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

The Center for the Education 
of Women + hosted its annual 
CEW+ Advocacy Symposium on 
Tuesday. This year, the theme 
centered around “Redefining 
Leadership,” 
and 
the 
symposium schedule comprised 
keynote speakers, development 

workshops and a roundtable 
discussion. 
The center supports the 
University 
of 
Michigan 
community by providing events, 
workshops, counseling, as well 
as scholarships and emergency 
funding to help individuals 
finance their degrees. The goal 
of CEW+ is to empower women 
and underserved individuals 
to help them reach their full 

potential.
According to CEW+ Director 
Tiffany Marra, CEW+ first 
launched 
the 
symposium 
to empower students, staff 
and community members to 
advocate for themselves when 
faced with a lack of resources, 
training, 
and 
supportive 
community.
During her opening speech, 
Marra 
highlighted 
the 

different leadership styles the 
symposium explores.
“There’s no single definition 
of leadership — there’s no 
one way to lead,” Marra said. 
“Today’s 
symposium 
will 
challenge normative ideas of 
leadership, and our presenters 
will provide alternative models 
of leadership that you can look 
towards for inspiration.”
The University of Michigan 
and Speech First, an organization 
dedicated to promoting and 
upholding freedom of speech 
on college campuses, agreed 
to settle an ongoing lawsuit 
related to freedom of speech and 
the University’s Bias Response 
Team. The agreement to settle, 
which effectively dismissed the 
lawsuit, was reached between 
Oct. 24 and 25.
Since 
May 
8, 
2018, 
the 
University and Speech First have 
been engaged in a dispute over 
whether the University’s Bias 
Response Team stifled freedom 
of 
speech 
on 
campus 
and 
violated the First Amendment. 
The University created the Bias 
Response Team during the 2010-
2011 academic year to investigate 
claims of racism, sexism and 
other forms of discrimination 
put 
forth 
anonymously 
by 
students, 
faculty 
and 
staff. 
Speech First declared the team 
unconstitutional.
According to the settlement 
agreement, 
the 
University 
replaced 
the 
Bias 
Response 
Team with Campus Climate 
Support beginning in the 2019-
2020 school year with no plans 
to reinstate the Bias Response 
Team in the future.

Washtenaw County Sheriff 
Jerry 
Clayton 
released 
a 
joint statement along with 
Texas District Attorney Mark 
Gonzalez and Miriam Aroni 
Krinsky, executive director of 
Fair and Just Prosecution, in 
support of Deferred Action for 
Childhood Arrivals Oct. 17.
Clayton 
spoke 
about 
a 
conference the three of them 
attended 
discussing 
the 
effects of policy on public 
safety. 
“When 
we 
say 
‘public 
safety,’ people just throw 
that word out,” Clayton said. 
“But we have to think about 
what ‘public safety’ means — 
how we define it. It’s not just 
‘free from crime,’ it’s ‘all your 
basic needs are met.’ There’s a 
level of comfort and serenity 
to be in your community and 
know that you’re supported. 
All of those things I think 
factor into this sense of public 
safety, and DACA and what it 
delivers to individuals factor 
into that.”
The statement notes the use 
of “community policing,” or 
the approach of collaborating 
with communities to reduce 
crime and promote public 
safety.

On 
Tuesday 
night, 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan’s 
Central Student Government 
met to discuss candidate criteria 
for the new vice president of 
Student Life and updates on 
the renovation of the Michigan 
Union.
Members 
of 
the 
Vice 
President 
for 
Student 
Life 
Search 
Advisory 
Committee 
attended the 12th CSG of the 
year meeting to hear comments 
and concerns about replacement 
candidates 
for 
E. 
Royster 
Harper, who will be retiring in 
January. Robert Sellers, vice 
provost for equity and inclusion 
and chief diversity officer, sat in 
place of Committee Chair Alec 
Gallimore. 
Presidential Mark Schissel 
launched the search on Oct. 10, 

to find a new vice president of 
Student Life. The committee 
has already held two town halls 
to gather student input for the 
search and plans to meet with 
Harper’s 
student 
advisory 
board next week and eventually, 
Harper herself. 
Sellers 
shared 
the 
committee 
has 
decided 
to 
make the candidates’ identities 
confidential in order to find 
the most qualified person and 
protect them from retaliation at 
their current career positions. 
“The 
reason 
for 
confidentiality 
is 
to 
really 
make sure that we get the very 
best candidates to apply and 
participate in the process,” 
Sellers said. “Many of the 
candidates that we will be 
looking 
at 
are 
currently 
employed in very important, 
interesting positions, and the 
idea of a public search that 

they may actually not end up 
as the number one case could 
potentially 
jeopardize 
their 
standing 
in 
their 
current 
institution.”
Assembly members shared 
concerns regarding what they 
wanted the new vice president 
to be aware of once they take 
over. Ben Gerstein, Public Policy 
junior and CSG president, told 
the search committee he wanted 
the new vice president to be 
prepared to handle the political 
climate on campus, especially in 
light of the University hosting 
the 
presidential 
debate 
in 
October 2020. 
“I think that’s important 
to keep in mind that, given 
we are entering an election 
year, that there are going to 
be 
controversial 
discussions 
on 
campus, 
and 
to 
make 
sure 
that 
they 
have 
an 
understanding of that and have 
prior experience dealing 
with issues in a political 
campus climate,” Gerstein 
said. “Understanding the 
importance 
of 
involving 
students in issues about the 
election when they come up, 
especially around security, 
and the fact that we are 
holding 
a 
presidential 
debate next year will add to 
that issue as well.”
Taylor Lansey, LSA junior 
and CSG treasurer, told 
the search committee the 
candidate should focus on 
improving Counseling and 
Psychological Services, as 
well as students’ awareness 
of campus resources. 
“In terms of CAPS, I 
think that someone who 
values 
the 
integration 
of that into our general 
community 
might 
be 
beneficial,” 
Lansey 
said. 
“Somebody who values the 
integration of that because 
we are saying we don’t want 
students to be afraid to go 
to CAPS, but I would say a 
large number of students 
actually haven’t met anyone 

from CAPS.”
In addition, Director of the 
Michigan Union Amy White 
spoke to CSG about the new 
renovations and goals of the 
Michigan Union. The Michigan 
Union has been closed for 
renovation since April 2018 and 
will reopen in January 2020. 
She gave a presentation about 
the history of the union and its 
renovation plans.
Student 
organizations 
will be housed on the second 
floor of the Union, along with 
the IdeaHub, an open space 
for 
student 
organization 
meetings. 
Previously, 
there 
were only 80 offices for student 
organizations, 
but 
the 
new 
building will provide enough 
space 
for 
all 
the 
student 
organizations 
on 
campus. 
Student Life’s office will be 
located on the third floor. CAPS 
and SAPAC will be on the fourth 
floor, allowing more private 
space for counselors to meet 
with students.
White said feedback from 
students has been essential 
in renovating the Union, and 
many of those concerns were 
addressed in the renovations, 
including creating more space 
for student organizations.
“Those 
of 
you 
who 
experienced the Union before 
we closed might remember that 
the student organization office 
in the building were tucked 
in former hotel rooms on the 
fourth floor,” White said. “...
What we heard was that we 
need to look at a different model 
for that. The other thing that 
we heard was there are 1,600 
student organizations on this 
campus. We have 80 office 
spaces on the fourth floor, that 
doesn’t even begin to look at 
the equity across organizations 
and the needs that exist. So 
what we’ve looked to do is really 
design a new space.”

Spooky festivities brew on Halloween

October 31, 1990
Ghastly ghouls and spooky 
sights are sure to attract 
scary 
souls 
tonight.That 
is if you’re not too old for 
Halloween. Unfortunately 
for 
horrific-minded 
but 
responsible 
students, 
Halloween 
falls 
on 
a 
midweek evening amidst 
midterm 
anxiety. 
As 
a 
result, some of the fun has 
to wait until the weekend.
“Halloween comes at a 
bad time this year,” said 
LSA sophomore Jonathon 
Marx. 
“I 
haven’t 
even 
thought 
of 
going 
out, 

especially since I have a 
midterm. 
Besides, 
most 
people either celebrated it 
last weekend or will this 
weekend.”
Last weekend did not 
lack activities. East Quad 
did the “Halloween Thang” 
and 
R.O.T.C. 
sponsored 
its annual Haunted House 
before hundreds of scary 
souls.
In spite of midterms, 
a 
multitude 
of 
parties 
have 
worked 
their 
way 
into 
students’ 
calendars 
this 
week. 
Among 
the 
Halloween 
personalities 

appearing this week are 
Phantom 
of 
the 
Opera, 
Medussa and the New Kids 
on the Block.
Fantasy Attic, a popular 
customer in Ann Arbor, 
is not surprised by their 
excellent sales this season. 
Lindsay 
James, 
a 
sales 
assistant, said “Dick Tracy, 
Breathless Mahoney and 
the Teenage Mutant Ninja 
Turtles are the hot in 
demand this year. Pirates 
are always a favorite, too.”
Big kids aren’t holding 
a monopoly on fun in Ann 
Arbor this week. Residence 

halls, such as Mary Markley, 
East Quad and Stockwell, 
are taking part in Trick-or-
Treating activities for local 
children. Student residents 
who signed up are visited 
by area kids making the 
candy rounds.
First-year LSA student 
and East Quad resident Jun 
Pangilinan is taking part in 
the festivities. He said “I 
thought it’d be nice to watch 
the kids Trick-or-Treating 
since I’m no longer doing it 
myself.” His intentions are 
less than noble, however, as 
he added, “Besides, I get to 

keep the candy left-overs.”
Music enthusiasts eagerly 
await the School of Music’s 
annual Halloween Concert 
tonight. The fun is slated 
to begin at 9 p.m. as the 
University 
Philharmonic 
Orchestra performs skits 
and ensembles before a 
sold-out audience at Hill 
Auditorium. Free tickets 
were 
distributed 
within 
two hours of availability 
weeks ago.
“It 
should 
be 
really 
fun,” said School of Music 
sophomore 
Jennifer 
Fari 
Ansel. 
“Everyone, 

including 
some 
of 
the 
audience, comes dressed 
in costumes. Some of the 
sections are coming as a 
group. I’m excited to see 
the flutes in their ZZ Top 
skit.”
Yet, amidst the fun, the 
environmental concerns of 
the 1990’s are not forgotten. 
LSA senior Elizabeth Steel 
said “the weirdest costume 
At East Quad’s Halloween 
Thang would have to be the 
guy who came dressed in 
non-recyclable plastic.” 
It must have been a scary 
sight to behold.

Climate change could have dire 
impacts on Michigan farmers. 
As a result, local producers are 
taking matters into their own 
hands to cope with extreme 
temperatures and unpredictable 
weather patterns in the state.
Earlier 
in 
October, 
Sen. 
Debbie 
Stabenow, 
D-Mich, 
released a report entitled “The 
Climate Crisis and Michigan” 
to address environmental issues 
surrounding the state and the 
implications of climate change on 
local communities.
Sections of the report discuss 
various ways climate change has 
affected Michigan’s physical and 
economic landscape, including 
damages to agriculture, winter 
recreation and both public and 
private infrastructure.
Agriculture 
is 
the 
second 
largest industry in Michigan, 
representing about a quarter of all 
jobs. These jobs require a stable 
and reliable climate in order to 
succeed. The report highlighted 
a 
phenomenon 
called 
“false 
spring,” marked by unseasonal 
warmth and sudden shifts back 
to cold temperatures. According 
to the report, the phenomenon 
puts stress on crops and causes 
them to underperform. In 2012, 
Michigan farmers lost 90 percent 
of the tart cherry crop due to false 
spring, according to the report. 
Climate 
change 
is 
also 
impacting local life. Stephanie 

Willette, manager of the Ann 
Arbor Farmers Market, noted the 
dangers of climate instability in 
recent years, as well as its impact 
on crop yield in Ann Arbor.
“This year, we had that cold 
snap that was a lot later than 
normal, and so we didn’t have 
hardly any peaches at all that 
were good this year,” Willette 
said. “That’s kind of rare and 
really happens when you get 
(temperatures) 
that 
aren’t 
normal, and we had a late frost 
this spring.”
At the end of every year, the 
market releases an annual report 
in which Ann Arbor residents 
can voice feedback on the market 
and its vendors. In 2018, various 
complaints pertained to creating 
an indoor version of the year-
round market for winter months. 
Willette explained extreme 
weather 
patterns 
caused 
by 
climate change, like severe wind 
and rain, pose a serious threat to 
the physical market, as well as to 
the items vendors can sell during 
the year.
“I think there is a concern that 
storms, rain, snow are going to 
become more severe, and that 
is one of the things pushing the 
issue, and we’re taking a look at 
trying to winterize the space,” 
Willette said. “We are working 
with (the city) in order to try and 
install solar, so we’re thinking in 
terms of how our facility can be 
more sustainable. How can we 
have energy solutions that are not 
contributing to climate change 
that are reliable long-term?”

Anxieties surrounding lack of 
a plentiful harvest can also put 
stress on the farmers, who risk 
job instability. According to the 
report, an increase in Michigan’s 
poor air quality has exacerbated 
the 
annual 
allergy 
season. 
Warmer conditions caused by 
climate change have allowed 
disease-carrying 
pests 
like 
mosquitoes and ticks to thrive 
in the state, both of which pose 
statewide public health concerns.
Eric Kampe, a vendor at the 
Ann Arbor Farmers Market and 
the owner of Ann Arbor Seed 
Company, 
explained 
climate 
change can harm a farmer’s 
financial and emotional well-
being.
“Folks that farm really love and 
care (about) what they’re doing, 
and if the wind is blowing hard 
and you’re thinking, ‘Man, is this 
going to ruin one of my buildings, 
or break one of my hoop houses, 
or is this stressing out my crops?’” 
Kampe said. “You can put on your 
accountant hat, (but) that’s not 
who we are as living creatures. 
It’s stressful, it’s hard, you don’t 
sleep well at night … It definitely 
can hurt the bottom line and hurt 
your ability to make a living.”
Stabenow’s report concludes 
with solutions to the problems 
of climate change in Michigan, 
such as investing in renewable 
energy and employing smarter 
agricultural practices.

Exactly how the change will 
manifest is unclear to everyone 
involved. 
Even 
NCAA 
President Mark Emmert kept 
things ambiguous when he 
spoke to reporters Tuesday.
“We’re going to have to wait 
and see what transpires with 
each of these legislatures,” 
Emmert said. “We believe very 
deeply in the board … that you 
have to have a national system 
if you’re going to have national 
championships. 
Doing 
all 
these things state by state is 
at best ineffective and most 
likely makes it very difficult 
or impossible.”
At the same time Emmert 
spoke, 
bills 
similar 
to 
California’s had already begun 
taking shape in Washington, 
Colorado, Illinois and Florida. 
Federally, Rep. Mark Walker, 
R-N.C., proposed a bill while 
Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., 
took to Twitter on Tuesday 
to say he would introduce a 
measure to make any income 
gained by college athletes 
taxable.
A U-M spokesperson told 

The Daily Tuesday afternoon 
that athletic director Warde 
Manuel 
had 
no 
comment 
on the situation at the time. 
Men’s basketball coach Juwan 
Howard has pled ignorance 
on the issue when asked and 
football coach Jim Harbaugh 
pivoted 
— 
diverting 
the 
conversation towards allowing 
players to declare for the 
NFL Draft early. Harbaugh’s 
proposal was to allow players 
to turn professional at any 
point in their college careers 
while keeping their amateur 
status intact.
“That’s something I think 
would be fair and beneficial to 
everybody,” Harbaugh said on 
Oct. 7.
“We must embrace change 
to provide the best possible 
experience 
for 
college 
athletes,” 
said 
Ohio 
State 
president and NCAA Board of 
Directors chair Michael Drake 
in a press release. “Additional 
flexibility in this area can 
and must continue to support 
college sports as part of higher 
education.”
Gene Smith, Ohio State’s 
athletic director, said earlier 
this month that he opposed 
California’s 
legislation, 
emphasizing the need for a 

federal framework.
Though players may not 
have 
been 
aware 
of 
the 
specifics of the legislation, 
their stances became clear on 
Tuesday.
“The amount of time and 
work we put in, just how big 
the football industry is, how 
much it’s increasing, I think, 
yeah, give back to us a little 
bit,” said redshirt freshman 
tight end Luke Schoonmaker. 
“We’re the ones (playing).”
Schoonmaker also pointed 
to 
financial 
troubles 
that 
many players face, saying he 
had to look for a job over the 
summer for extra money. 
At the same time, the Big 
Ten is in the midst of a six-
year TV rights deal with ESPN 
and Fox Sports worth $2.64 
billion, while Harbaugh, the 
third-highest paid coach in 
college football, is set to make 
$7.5 million this season.
“I’d say food-wise, I think 
most of the guys, too, are 
always hungry,” Schoonmaker 
said. “And it’d just help during 
the week with being able to 
eat some more and have more 
money for that. And any daily 
needs and stuff, just could 
help us, week to week.”

The CCS serves a similar 
purpose, but does not reach out 
to the subjects of the anonymous 
reports 
directly. 
According 
to the University Record, the 
settlement does not bar staff 
members 
from 
speaking 
to 
individual students or student 
groups about any incidents that 
may have occurred. 
The new CCS will continue to 
address issues of discrimination 
on campus and support those 
who choose to report, University 
spokesman 
Rick 
Fitzgerald 
wrote in an email to The Daily. 
The goal of the CCS is to make 
University resources available to 
students, faculty and staff when 
instances 
of 
discrimination 
arise.
“The focus of this work is 
providing support, which has 
been the long-standing primary 
(focus) of this work,” Fitzgerald 
wrote.
LSA junior Lincoln Ballew, 
chairman of the University’s 
chapter of Young Americans 
for Freedom, said the CCS will 
benefit the University in ways 
the Bias Response Team did not. 
“I think that’s a much better 
system than the BRT because 
it doesn’t make anyone afraid 
to speak what they would like 
to,” Ballew said. “But also, it 
provides support for people who 
may be offended by comments. 
So, it’s a good system to replace 
the BRT.”

In August 2018, U.S District 
Court Judge, Linda V. Parker, 
sided with the University and 
rejected Speech First’s request 
for a preliminary injunction 
against 
the 
Bias 
Response 
Team. According to Parker, 
in September of this year, a 
federal appeals court reversed 
Parker’s decision and voided 
the ruling on the basis the Bias 
Response Team infringed upon 
the First Amendment rights 
by allowing students to report 
discrimination anonymously. 
According to the settlement 
agreement, 
the 
University 
removed certain definitions of 
“harassment” and “bullying” 
from its Statement of Student 
Rights and Responsibilities on 
June 11, 2018, after the lawsuit 
was filed by Speech First. The 
change was meant to clarify the 
definitions of these terms for 
students, faculty and staff. 
Fitzgerald told the University 
Record the decision to settle 
will reaffirm the University’s 
commitment 
to 
freedom 
of 
speech and prevent against 
similar 
claims 
against 
the 
University in the future.
“Vigorous debate on all sides 
of an issue has been a hallmark 
of this campus before and 
during the lawsuit,” Fitzgerald 
said. “We have confidence that 
true diversity of thought will 
continue to flourish on our 
campus.”
The decision to settle is a 
victory for the organization 
and for free speech rights on 
college campuses, University 

spokesman 
Rick 
Fitzgerald 
wrote in an email to The Daily. 
Neily wrote that Speech First 
is satisfied with this decision 
but will continue to watch the 
University for any actions that 
may violate First Amendment 
rights. 
“The settlement gives us the 
relief we initially requested: 
the University agrees to never 
return to the unconstitutional 
definitions of ‘bullying’ and 
‘harassing,’ and to never return to 
the Bias Response Team,” Neily 
wrote. “We have reserved our 
rights to challenge the Campus 
Climate Support program in 
the future should the program 
ever be used to chill students’ 
speech. This victory paves the 
way for college students who 
may have been too fearful or 
intimidated to express their 
opinions to finally embrace their 
free speech rights and engage in 
true academic discourse.”
When 
contacted 
by 
The 
Daily, College Democrats and 
College Republicans declined to 
comment on the outcome of the 
lawsuit. 
Ballew said she hopes the 
settlement, and the lawsuit in 
general, allows students to speak 
freely with each other and voice 
their opinions in ways they may 
have not been able to previously. 
“I 
hope 
it 
provides 
an 
environment for students to be 
able to have honest and open 
conversations without fear of 
problems from the University 
because of what they’re saying,” 
Ballew said.

“Roughly one-fifth of police 
officers surveyed reported that, 
in 2017, immigrants were less 
willing than they were in 2016 to 
make police reports, less likely 
to help police when they arrived 
at the scene of the crime, less 
likely to assist with subsequent 
investigations, and less willing 
to work with prosecutors,” the 
statement reads. 
According to the statement, 
DACA is seen as a method 
to 
preserve 
the 
fragile 
relationships between local law 
enforcement and communities. 
“With DACA, you’d have a 
portion of individuals that aren’t 
as concerned about immigration 
enforcement,” 
Clayton 
said. 
“They know their presence in 
a country is supported. Then 
legally, they don’t have to fear 
ice coming out of nowhere or law 
enforcement seizing them and 
taking them out of the county.”
With this growing fear, the 
statement notes more crimes are 
going unreported, endangering 
the entire community.
“As a result, more than half 
of the law enforcement officials 
surveyed reported that crimes 
such 
as 
domestic 
violence, 
human trafficking, and sexual 

assault 
have 
become 
more 
difficult to investigate,” the 
statement reads. 
In his interview, Clayton 
reaffirmed 
the 
danger 
that 

unreported crimes pose to the 
community.
“Crime 
doesn’t 
know 
boundaries,” 
Clayton 
said. 
“We run the risk of having that 
behavior expanding beyond the 
immigrant community into the 
larger community. We should all 
be concerned and we should all 
know we have the responsibility 
to make every community in 
Washtenaw County safe.” 
Ann 
Arbor 
resident 
Sue 
Shink is vice president of Pilar’s 
Foundation, an organization that 
recently held a gala to stand with 
refugees and immigrants. Shink 
said she has seen the effects of 
DACA on the community.
“My 
daughter, 
one 
of 
her best friend’s mom got 
deported,” 
Shink 
said. 
“It 
created an untenable situation. 
Her family has gone under a 
tremendous amount of stress, 
even though her parents have 
been contributing members of 
our society. The fear is well-
grounded.”
Ann Arbor resident Sylvia 
Nolasco-Rivers, 
president 
of 
Pilar’s Foundation, said she was 
excited to hear about Clayton’s 
statement.

“It’s nice to see someone in 
the community making sure that 
people feel safe,” Nolasco-Rivers 
said. “At the end of the day that’s 
what people need to do. We 
need to go beyond ourselves 
and expand our hearts out to 
others and find ways to bring the 
healing … and make it right.”
Yet, while some members of 
the community are thankful 
for the sheriff’s step, they don’t 
believe it is enough. 
In an email to The Daily, LSA 
senior Barbara Diaz, Student 
Community 
of 
Progressive 
Empowerment 
member, 
said 
DACA isn’t a cure-all solution. 
“While 
it’s 
nice 
to 
see 
people 
supporting 
DACA 
program, I think it becomes 
easy to dehumanize the issue 
of immigration as a whole 
when we only focus on how 
immigrants benefit us,” Diaz 
wrote. “Perhaps trust between 
immigrant communities and the 
police help make neighborhoods 
safer, but I think people (with 
or without citizenship status) 
having access to life-saving 
resources is important on its 
own regard. Also I understand 
that sometimes things need 
to be said in a certain way to 
persuade people, but at the same 
time we shouldn’t advocate for 
others only because there’s some 
benefit in return.”

Marra and the Assistant 
Director 
of 
the 
Barger 
Leadership 
Institute, 
Carmeda Stokes, a Strategic 
Initiatives & Organizational 
Learning Consultant at U-M, 
announced the launch of the 
COUNTS Toolkit for Students 
Success 
in 
partnership 
with 
the 
Council 
for 
Nontraditional Students and 
University Human Resources 
Organizational Learning. The 
Toolkit is an online module 
that provides training and 
resources to help participants 
become more aware of the 
different 
experiences 
and 
challenges students face on 
campus. 
“It’s designed for student-
facing staff to provide them 
with resources and tools to 
enhance how they support 
students on campus,” Marra 
said. 
“We’ve 
defined 
19 
different groups that we are 
promoting that need a little 
more attention and visibility 
to break down the ‘Leaders 
and the Best’ kind of model 
that everyone has in their 
mind about what it is to be a 
student here.”
Counselor 
and 
Program 
Coordinator 
of 
CEW+ 
Morgan Hull spearheaded the 
development of the Toolkit.
“The focus of the topics that 
we select for the Toolkit are 
based off of the trends that 
we hear from the COUNTS 
group, 
from 
nontraditional 
students that we see at CEW+ 
and others that we hear across 
campus,” Hull said.
For 
this 
rollout, 
the 
topics include the imposter 
syndrome, as well as basic 
needs 
on 
college 
and 
wayfinding on a decentralized 
campus. The COUNTS Toolkit 
is live on Canvas and is open 
to all University staff and 

students.
The symposium included 
a keynote panel featuring 
Shannon Cohen, founder of 
Shannon Cohen, Inc., and 
Stephanie Land, author of 
“Maid: 
Hard 
Work, 
Low 
Pay, and a Mother’s Will to 
Survive.”
Cohen 
spoke 
about 
her 
experience with a lack of racial 
diversity in communities and 
professional 
environments. 
Cohen 
emphasized 
the 
importance 
of 
discussing 
diversity in the employment 
practices of companies. 
“One 
of 
the 
ways 
my 
advocacy plays out is that 
organizations are recognizing 
that 
those 
brands 
and 
organizations that will be 
visual, valuable and vocal in 
the future must reconcile this 
space of how they engage and 
build authentic relationships 
with one another,” Cohen said. 
Stephanie 
Land 
read 
excerpts 
from 
her 
book, 
which detailed her accounts 
of being a single mother 
living in poverty. In the past, 
she worked as a housekeeper 
for the wealthy and was on 
welfare to cover necessary 
expenses. 
In response to a question 
asking the pair what inspired 
them to keep pushing forward, 
Cohen called on the strength 
of advocates of the past and 
expressed her gratitude for 
the progress past women have 
made. 
“I know that I am my 
ancestor’s 
wildest 
dream,” 
Cohen said. “I literally know 
that I am because of the 
resilience of other women, 
specifically for me, my mother 
and my great grandmother 
… 
I 
know 
that 
I 
could 
walk on this campus today 
because 
someone 
did 
the 
uncomfortable.”
Land answered the question 
by first noting the implications 
of low socioeconomic status. 

“I ended up falling into a 
niche of poverty and social 
economic justice,” Land said. 
“It was incredibly unnerving 
to admit that I was in that 
situation 
because 
society 
made me feel like a complete 
failure in the last decade, 
just because we often look at 
people who aren’t ‘making it’ 
as people that aren’t working 
as hard.”
She said once she started 
writing online, she began to 
see a community form around 
her, urging her to continue 
sharing her story. 
“I realized that there wasn’t 
really a niche for first-person 
narratives that came from 
impoverished 
situations, 
because poor people can’t 
afford to write about their 
lives, and they can’t afford to 
find mentorship or access to 
publish,” Land said. 
Today, 
she 
said 
she 
is 
motivated to help people in 
low income households speak 
up about their experiences. 
Rackham student Andrew 
Gilroy said he was inspired by 
Land’s perspective. He said 
he attended the symposium 
on behalf of the Coalition on 
Temporary Shelter in Detroit, 
where he interacts with a 
lot of women, children and 
people of color. By attending 
the symposium, Gilroy said he 
hoped to learn better ways to 
support them in the homeless 
shelter. 
“I think hearing the stories 
that 
they 
provide 
really 
provide a different perspective 
that people often don’t hear,” 
Gilroy said. “I’ve never been 
in poverty, and I’m not from 
a marginalized population, 
so being able to hear that 
perspective changes the way 
people think. I really think it’s 
helpful to hear that, because 
you can make better decisions 
when interacting with people 
from those populations.”

According 
to 
Statista, 
McDonald’s currently leads in 
total fast-food sales. In 2018, 
McDonald’s generated $38.52 
billion in sales, while Starbucks, 
the 
second 
most 
profitable 
chain in the U.S., made $19.66 
billion. Yet McDonald’s has 
come under frequent criticism 
for the treatment of animals in 
their supply chain, especially 
concerning 
the 
housing 
conditions of their chickens 
and the slaughtering of their 
animals. 
Students at the University 
have been protesting against 
unethical fast food practices 
for a number of months. In 
January, when the renovation 
of 
the 
Michigan 
Union 

prompted questions about what 
restaurants should open in the 
new space, students led protests 
against Wendy’s employee labor 
conditions. Students have also 
spoken out against Wendy’s 
unwillingness to sign onto the 
Fair Food Program. When the 
Union’s restaurant lineup was 
announced 
in 
mid-October, 
Wendy’s was not included in 
the list of companies that will 
serve students when the Union 
reopens in January 2020 after 
the franchise owner declined to 
renew the lease. 
LSA senior Zina Abourjeily, 
a 
member 
of 
MARS, 
said 
the 
University’s 
student 
organizations can play a large 
role in the prevention of animal 
abuse. 
“We tried to leverage MARS 
members to come out as a way to 

build community around animal 
activism and also (show that) we 
care,” Abourjeily said. 
During the protest, students 
and community members held 
signs reading “stop this abuse,” 
“animals deserve better” and 
“the sad truth.” 
Trevor Bechtel, a pastor at 
Shalom Community Church and 
student engagement coordinator 
at the Ford School of Public 
Policy, said he attended the 
protest because he believes 
McDonald’s should be meeting 
much 
higher 
standards 
of 
ethical food preparation. 
“The protest is about silently 
opposing 
how 
McDonald’s 
prepares 
its 
food 
— 
from 
the fields, to the farm, to the 
processing, packaging,” Bechtel 
said. “We can do a lot better than 
what McDonald’s is doing.”

Where is the urgency?

ANDREW MEKHAIL | OP-ED

We need to fix our aging infrastructure
W

hether you think 
about our rusting 
bridges, 
pothole-
riddled 
roads 
or 
antiquated 
water 
and 
electrical 
systems, you have 
surely noticed the 
alarming 
state 
of 
our old and decaying 
infrastructure. You 
should be alarmed. 
A 
recent 
report 
card 
from 
the 
American 
Society 
of Civil Engineers 
confirmed 
what 
most 
Americans already suspected: 
The 
U.S.’s 
neglected 
infrastructure is in the middle 
of a serious crisis.
These reports, released every 
few years, rank these essential 
systems at an embarrassing 
D+ 
overall. 
Breaking 
our 
infrastructure down into over 
a dozen categories, the marks 
become downright disturbing: 
Bridges earned a C+, energy a 
D+, wastewater a D+, drinking 
water a D and transit a D-, to 
name a few.
This 
shouldn’t 
come 
as a surprise. Millions of 
Americans are aware of the 
startling condition of these 
vital systems that keep our 
nation up and running. The 
decrepit water systems across 
this nation have been exposed 
 
by events like the Flint water 
crisis, almost 190 million trips 
are made across “structurally 
deficient” bridges each day 
and it is becoming increasingly 
difficult for our power grid to 
support the complex needs of 
our 21st century economy.
Unfortunately, 
according 
to the ASCE, our government 
would need to come up with 
$4.5 trillion by 2027 in order to 
bring our infrastructure back 
up to speed — something that 
in this divisive political age 
seems highly unlikely. 
While it seems that some 
proposals have gained a bit of 
traction — such as a $2 trillion 
plan to address this deepening 
problem reported by The New 
York Times — Washington as 
a whole has miserably failed 
to address this crisis. Year 
after year, Republicans and 
Democrats have been unable 
to part ways with politics 
and address this dangerous 
situation, instead preoccupied 
with how to pay for these 
much-needed improvements. 
Even 
President 
Donald 

Trump, who has expressed 
deep interest in fixing our 
infrastructure, 
has 
fallen 
short. In his victory 
speech 
in 
2016, 
he stated that his 
administration 
would 
work 
to 
“rebuild 
our 
highways, 
bridges, 
tunnels, 
airports, 
schools, 
hospitals.” 
But 
his 
infrastructure 
proposal, 
announced 
in 
February 2018, sadly made 
limited 
progress 
amid 
the 
complexity of partisan politics.
Ultimately, 
our 
elected 
officials 
have 
failed 
to 
realize 
that 
solid, 
modern 
infrastructure 
in 
good 
working 
order 
is 
essential 
to 
a 
successful 
economy, 
especially one as advanced 
as ours. Failing to allocate 
the money and resources to 
our infrastructure will surely 
send shock waves throughout 
our entire economic system. 

With our infrastructure in 
poor 
condition, 
our 
roads 
and highways will be more 
congested 
and 
harder 
to 
navigate, 
our 
public 
transportation 
systems 
will 
be less reliable for employees 
trying 
to 
get 
to 
work, 
communities will be more 
isolated from each other and 
it will be more difficult to 
address climate change. 
As stated by Robert Puentes, 
a nonresident senior fellow 
in the Metropolitan Policy 
Program 
at 
the 
Brookings 
Institution, 
“Infrastructure 
enables 
trade, 
powers 
businesses, 
connects 
workers to their jobs, creates 
opportunities for struggling 
communities and protects the 
nation from an increasingly 
unpredictable 
natural 
environment.”
Take the interstate highway 
system as an example: As 

one of the greatest advances 
in 
American 
infrastructure 
of 
the 
20th 
century, 
this 
complex network of roads that 
stretches across the entire 
nation provides for extremely 
efficient travel of both people 
and goods. According to the 
Highway and Motorway Fact 
Book, “The interstate highway 
system has had a profound 
effect 
upon 
the 
American 
economy 
and 
contributed 
significantly 
to 
improved 
economic 
efficiency 
and 
productivity.” 
Without 
the 
construction of this system — 
much of which is now in need 
of drastic repairs — our way 
of life would be dramatically 
different. “People would be 
crowded into more densely 
packed inner cities, intercity 
travel would occur less often 
and be more cumbersome; 
freight 
charges 
would 
be 
higher and, as a consequence, 
so would prices. Vacation travel 
would be more restricted,” the 
fact book states.
Beyond 
the 
direct 
economic benefits of strong 
infrastructure, generating the 
resources and jobs to actually 
rebuild 
these 
crumbling 
systems is also a significant 
economic 
stimulant. 
The 
Center for American Progress 
reports 
that 
“upgrading 
roads, bridges, and other basic 
infrastructure 
creates 
jobs 
now by putting people to work 
earning 
good, 
middle-class 
incomes, which expands the 
consumer base for businesses.” 
Worthwhile 
investments 
into these vital systems is a 
surefire way to truly reduce 
unemployment 
nationwide 
while 
simultaneously 
providing a stronger base for 
our nation to operate upon.
In 
the 
end, 
fixing 
our 
decaying 
infrastructure 
is 
not something that we can 
choose to debate. Regardless 
of political identity, we all 
greatly benefit from secure 
energy 
systems, 
strong 
communication 
networks 
and safe highways, railroads 
and 
airports. 
We 
cannot 
sit 
back 
and 
ignore 
the 
steady deterioration of our 
infrastructure while counting 
on it to fill our needs. If we 
don’t serve it through common 
sense action, it will inevitably 
be too broken to serve us.

Democrats have

A

t the time of publication, 
the teachers of Chicago 
Public 
Schools 
have 
decided to strike and walk 
out indefinitely until their 
demands regarding problems 
like funding and pay have 
been met. Other demands from 
the strikers include smaller 
class sizes, more paid time to 
prepare lessons and hiring 
more 
supplementary 
staff, 
like nurses and counselors. 
This isn’t the first time the 
Chicago 
Teachers 
Union 
has organized a strike. The 
same thing happened back in 
2012, with similar claims of 
paltry pay and understaffing 
of schools. But the woes 
of 
the 
CTU 
are 
awfully 
familiar. Many urban school 
districts around the country 
are reportedly understaffed 
and underfunded, including 
many 
here 
in 
Michigan. 
The same issues that plague 
Chicago’s schools affects us 
here in Michigan. In many 
communities around the state, 
educators and parents bring 
up the same concerns.
According to some reports, 
six in 10 schools started the 
school 
year 
understaffed 
in 2019. This usually leads 
to a reliance on long-term 
substitute teachers, who to 
qualify 
in 
Michigan 
only 
need 90 college credits. With 
dwindling 
pay 
and 
fading 
benefits, qualified teachers 
are 
growing 
ever 
harder 
to come by. In Michigan, 
teacher salaries have gone 
down by over 11 percent since 
2000. It’s much harder to 
convince people to come into 
education if they know the 
salaries are declining. There’s 
also the issue with student-
faculty 
ratios, 
which 
can 

greatly impact the quality of 
education students receive. In 
fact, a smaller student-faculty 
ratio is a great indicator of 
future academic achievement. 
To continue to pay teachers 
poorly is to deprive children 
of the education they deserve.
The awful truth of the 
matter 
is 
that 
many 
of 
the 
schools 
most 
affected 
by 
underfunding 
and 
understaffing are the districts 
that need the most support. 
Sixty 
teachers 
left 
Flint 
Community Schools in 2019 
alone. In Detroit, only 15,000 
of the city’s 85,000 students 
attended schools that made 
the mark for the state’s criteria 
of 
“performance.” 
Those 
statistics are frankly appalling 
and pathetic. 
Michigan has some unique 
problems concerning school 
funding. According to a study 
at Michigan State University, 
Michigan ranks “dead last” 
in funding growth, with the 
amount adjusted for inflation 
only being 85 percent of what 
it was in 1995. Predictably, 
Michigan’s schools have only 
ranked lower and lower on 
rankings 
for 
indicators 
of 
progress 
like 
standardized 
tests 
over 
time. 
Recently, 
however, 
the 
state 
budget 
might be increased on a per-
student basis by $240 dollars, 
at least for charter school 
students. But overall, Gov. 
Gretchen Whitmer’s budget 
is a mixed bag and might 
be insufficient to close the 
achievement gap.
It’s 
not 
up 
for 
debate 
that Michigan’s schools are 
inadequate 
in 
serving 
our 
children, but the way to solve 
the problem is often contested. 
Many cite charter schools as 

the answer, with claims that 
school choice is an effective 
way to address failing public 
schools, but that doesn’t seem 
to be the case. As of 2016, 70 
percent of the time charter 
schools were in the lower-
half of state school rankings. 
Charter school closures are 
also common, with Michigan’s 
rate being 31 percent between 
2000 and 2016. 87 percent 
of the students affected by 
said statistic were African 
Americans. Charter schools 
aren’t solving the inequality 
and 
troubles 
in 
Michigan 
schools and may be more 
trouble than they’re worth.
Solving these problems is 
going to take a lot of thought, 
and 
unfortunately, 
it’s 
something that’s also going 
to take a substantial amount 
of time. But one thing’s for 
sure: Our schools need more 
money. Salaries and conditions 
for teachers need to be better, 
considering 
the 
atrocious 
student-to-teacher ratio and 
retention rate. School spending 
in 
poorer 
school 
districts 
is directly correlated with 
rising test scores over time, 
and it’s undeniable that many 
districts 
are 
underfunded. 
In 
Michigan’s 
pursuit 
of 
evening out the gap between 
wealthier districts and poorer 
districts, it must recognize 
that money must be spent. 
Unfortunately, 
this 
means 
increasing expenditures, but 
there are ways of raising the 
funds. Though education is 
an 
expensive 
endeavor, 
it 
makes all the difference in 
maintaining 
a 
prosperous 
society.

O

n Oct. 4, I was fortunate 
to see former Secretary 
of State Condoleezza 
Rice 
speak 
at 
a 
“Master 
Class” given to a select group 
of 
University 
of 
Michigan 
undergraduate 
and 
graduate 
students. Guided by her vast 
experience, Rice spoke clearly 
and 
compellingly 
on 
issues 
like democracy, identity and 
international affairs. As the 
Master Class came to a close, 
however, my admiration gave 
way to dissatisfaction. 
The class was structured so 
that some participants had to 
watch her on a projector in a 
separate room, leaving half of 
us unable to ask her questions. 
Walking out of those adjacent 
classrooms, the air felt like that 
of opera-goers having exited an 
excellent show.
Let me be clear that Rice is 
brilliant and she fought in her 
official capacity with sincerity 
in her beliefs. I am guided in 
my writing by gratitude at the 
opportunity to learn, rather 
than bitterness — though I am 
mad I didn’t get out of my seat, 
walk for about 20 seconds to the 
next class over, and try to ask a 
question myself.
As 
she 
spoke 
about 
complicated realities overseas, 
I was left to ponder the crisis 
our own country is wrestling 
with at home. Speaking with 
poise and grace that seemed 
impossible to faze, she made 
it feel as if we had won 
something, that our troubles as 
a country were distant either 
in time or in proximity. In our 
discussion, 
many 
countries 
who had succeeded or failed at 
democracy were put under the 
microscope as if they were cute 
or flawed little experiments that 
the United States could study in 
a sanitized, removed manner. 
How can we talk about the 
failed revolutions of the Arab 
Spring as if our government is 
not currently engulfed in flames? 
As an Egyptian-American, I sat 
and watched as she discussed 
the “Middle Eastern exception,” 
the question of why democracy 
hasn’t taken to this region as 
it has around the world. We 
poked and prodded at all the 
particularities, and she adorned 
the conversation with anecdotes 
of her shining moments as 
Secretary of State. She spoke at 
length about instances in which 
she coached other democracies 
and helped navigate the chaotic 
world that we, as a great power, 

have helped steep further into 
chaos.
Meanwhile, 
I 
see 
my 
American president describing 
the investigation against him as 
a coup, dispelling criticism as 
a “witch hunt” and “bullshit,” 
raging against every element of 
the world that is not obsequious 
and adulating toward him and 
calling for the arrest of key 
actors in the opposition party 
and the impeachment inquiry. 
Our decrepit executive wields 
extraordinary power in military 
capabilities 
and 
legislative 
authority, 
but 
even 
“good” 
presidents have mobilized the 
equal or lesser power of the 
office to catastrophic ends.
Am I supposed to laugh 
him off as impotent after Rice 
extolled the values of strong 
institutions? Am I supposed to 
ignore the damage he can do 
after she warned of the growing 
divide between those affected 
by policy realities and those 
protected through education and 
affluence?
Where is the urgency?
I’m careful not to mistake 
her composure for complacency. 
When it comes to the answers 
of her students, she said in an 
earlier talk that morning that she 
dislikes a response that starts 
with, “I feel like,” because more 
likely than not, she doesn’t care 
about that student’s feelings in 
an academic context. 
I internalized her wisdom 
that feelings can easily get in the 
way of an effective argument. 
But when it comes to my 
country’s fate and the outcomes 
of my neighbors around the 
world, I’d rather risk the passion 
that comes with urgency than 
the 
resignation 
risked 
by 
indifference. 
Warned 
by 
Rice 
not 
to 
weaponize our identities lest 
others do the same against us, I 
couldn’t help but think of those 
whose 
identities 
have 
been 
weaponized against themselves: 
immigrants, 
refugees 
and 
women 
whose 
autonomy 
is 
robbed by a government non-
representative of their identity, 
let alone their interests.
As Rice largely criticized 
democracies 
abroad, 
she 
celebrated the strength of our 
civil society here in America. 
Conflict in this country, she 
reassured, is settled in court, not 
by shooting each other. 
For her to choose gun violence 
as an analogy was emblematic of 
the divide I felt between her ease 

and my unrest. Our indifference 
loses precious American lives 
every day. The suffering to 
which I am a bystander is beyond 
calculation and comprehension. 
A classmate finally asked her 
a question about the state of our 
country’s pluralistic democracy. 
Rice chose to focus on how far 
we’ve come and the progress 
we’ve achieved. Certainly, giving 
history too much power can 
disempower us in the present, 
but I wonder if Rice is too far 
removed 
in 
experience 
and 
success to feel the danger that I 
feel.
In her answer, she argued 
that voting shouldn’t be easy. 
Maybe so, if it was equally hard 
for everyone, but arguments like 
those have allowed those with 
power to construct mazes of 
varying difficulty on the path to 
the ballot box. She mobilized the 
example of Roy Moore’s narrow 
defeat in an Alabama Senate race 
as an example of our democracy’s 
strength when it matters. For 
a man accused by nine women 
of sexual misconduct — several 
of whom were teenagers at the 
time of incident — to lose by only 
1.7 percentage points is a sign 
of fatal structural weakness to 
me. In his new election bid this 
upcoming year, every vote will 
matter. It is a moral travesty that 
so many Americans, including in 
the state of Alabama, continue to 
see their right to vote threatened 
and even removed.
Whether by erecting new 
hurdles or declaring arbitrary 
qualifications, some bureaucrats 
love to define what a “God-given 
right” should look like, and who 
God has given it to. 
Rice can argue that voting 
shouldn’t be easy, but arguing 
that it should be difficult to 
varying degrees is untenable. I 
don’t think we can measure our 
progress on how far we’ve come. 
To ensure that voting access is 
equally easy for all members 
of this democracy, we have to 
measure it by how far we have 
yet to go — by setting goals.
Secretary Rice: For fear of 
failing others and failing this 
moment, I cannot take solace in 
the ways our democracy is doing 
well. Our shaking democracy 
bears grave consequences for 
others, and before we can hope 
to stabilize it, we can expect 
more chaos.

Wednesday, October 30, 2019 — 5A

I’d never really seen a woman roar until I saw Big Thief in concert. 
It happened when the band performed “Not,” the fifth song of their 
set at Detroit’s Majestic Theatre on Thursday, Oct. 17. “Not” was the 
first single from their second release of 2019, Two Hands, which came 
out less than a week before the show.
At that point in the set, the members of Big Thief were still in the 
jackets they were wearing when they arrived on stage. There had 
been a genuine autumn coldness outside, and it was not much warmer 
inside the venue. With the hood of her gray, oversized sweatshirt 
pulled up, you could see Big Thief frontwoman Adrianne Lenker’s 
face just peeking through. She joked about it later, exclaiming in her 
gentle voice that she didn’t realize how full the audience was until she 
removed the hood. But in the moment, this glimpse of her face was 
like a vanishing point, all our horizons of thought and attention drawn 
toward it.
“Not” is structured as endlessly mounting anaphora of what it, 
unsurprisingly, is not (never, in fact, revealing what it is). By the time 
of the final chorus, the pent-up energy of the song is bursting at the 
seams. At that point completely mesmerized, I watched Lenker’s face 
as she wailed, “NOT DYING.” Screamed it. Made it thunder through 
everything that theater had to offer. Unsteadied our feet. 
Her voice tore through something that night — whether it was 
internal or external, physical or metaphysical, I still can’t tell you. 
What I can tell you is that this moment and a collection of soul-stirring 
moments from the show will probably never leave my mind. In the 
mere weeks that have passed, it has inspired three odes: to Big Thief, 
of course, to Adrianne Lenker and also to the people with whom I 
shared this experience.
The First Ode: To the band
Big Thief swiftly took to the stage after a half-hour opening set 
from Boston-based, Ellen Kempner-fronted alt-rock outfit Palehound. 
The latter proved a surprisingly fitting complement to the main act, 
with their musical agility (their setlist completing full circuits from 
mystical lullabies to lively rock ‘n’ roll) alongside pensive, humane 
lyrics, when before I wasn’t sure if any band could open well for Big 
Thief. 
Lenker, alongside Buck Meek on guitar, Max Oleartchik on bass 
and James Krivchenia on the drums, armed themselves with their 
instruments and without further ado, launched right into “Terminal 
Paradise,” followed by “Toy,” each drawn from their 2019 releases. 
Two slower, cosmic lead-ins for a band that has a way of creeping up 
on you — in other words, they could have lured us in no better way. 
The more upbeat Two Hands track “Forgotten Eyes” came third, for a 
well-timed change of pace and tone.
Not everyone was bobbing their heads to “Eyes,” but my friend and 
I were, unabashedly. Both of our signature moves also materialized 
at this time: He does something with his hands, like he’s pointing 
and tracing the trajectories of notes as they travel through his limbs, 
while I twirl my wrist like I’m conducting an invisible orchestra. 
Our responses to Big Thief were not entirely voluntary, my knees not 
always needing conscious effort to keep bending, his gestures also 
seeming unchoreographed. We were responding to musical reflex, 
instinct.
“Detroit’s got energy,” Meek said at some point, in the twang to 
match his cowboyish shirt with the two topmost buttons unbuttoned. 
In the packed venue, my friend and I both hoped that was directed at 
us.

Over the course of the roughly hour-
long set, they went on to grace us with 
nascent classics, like “Shark Smile,” 
“Masterpiece” 
and, 
in 
closing, 
an 
electric-guitar rendition of “Mary.”
But they also surprised us with more 
new music — as in, songs that exceeded 
U.F.O.F.’s and even Two Hands’ tracklists, 
three songs Lenker introduced as “brand 
new,” but not without the disclaimer, 
“New or old, what difference does it 
make?”
One was quiet and meditative, and 
sounded like it could have fit well on 
Lenker and Meek’s side collaboration 
a-sides. The other two were acoustic, 
and the second in particular gestured 
toward new developments in Lenker’s 
rich songwriting. It capitalized on wit in a 
way that I’d never heard before, and blended in social and existential 
commentary with echoes of Bob Dylan and the American folk tradition 
it’s easy to forget Big Thief, for all their wonderfully distinct qualities, 
is a part of.
Performing songs new or old, talking or playing, Big Thief always 
looked like they were doing what they love with people they love. In 
the way they marched on stage in matching cold-weather gear. In the 
way they would face each other in the instrumental interludes. In 
the way they look at one another in photographs as well as on stage, 
like friends, too interconnected to be described as new or old — what 
difference does it make?
The Second Ode: To the frontwoman
Adrianne Lenker writes songs in the form of what you might call 
constellations. The intimate scenes and objects she conjures in her 
lyrics are usually loosely linked but, when taken as a whole, emerge in 
breathtakingly ethereal arrangements. This approach to songwriting 
lends itself to impressive representations of ineffable things like 
memories, and the people we know and love, at the same time that it 
never feigns to capture them entirely — being the galaxies’ worth of 
components they are unto themselves. 
“Mary,” off Big Thief’s second LP Capacity, is the prime illustration 
of this. The verses dart from intimate image to intimate image, placing 
you in the center of a solar system of objects enchanted with the titular 
character’s memory. “Mom and dad and violins / Somber country 
silence / The needle stopped the kicking / The clothespins on the 
floor,” Lenker sings in the second of these verses; the chorus, over a 
minute long, is even more spellbinding, flipping relentlessly through 
the scrapbook of enchanted still lifes of her time with the real-life 
friend Mary. (Some of these objects you can almost hear creaking and 
tapping in the studio version, and make tangible appearances in other 
performances, like this one with 89.3 The Current.) When Lenker 
launched into this chorus for the final song of the set at the Majestic, 
it was the third time in that show that I watched, frozen, as everyone 
around me likewise stood still in awe.
Adrianne Lenker also writes about being in love in ways that are 
refreshing to encounter. She writes about “real love,” the examples 
our parents set that make us think it should “make our lungs black,” 
the bliss we find when we name it for ourselves. She titles songs after 
male and female lovers alike, and characterizes her relationships with 
refreshing earnesty, in the mess that love and imbalances of power 
make of them all.
When Adrianne Lenker sings about her mother, specifically, she can 
hush and still an entire room, like a mother’s lullaby, in fact, but more 
convincing in content than just form. And she did that night, when the 
band played “Real Love”: “Looking up to her / Watching her do her / 
makeup and hair.” My voice caught when I sang that lyric back to her; 
somehow, I didn’t see it coming.
And even before Lenker removed her hoodie midway through 
their set at the Majestic, I could tell her hair was short again. Maybe I 
should’ve seen that coming; Two Hands closes with the slow-burning 
“Cut My Hair.” It reminded me of how I used to feel when I would 
see Taylor Swift’s wild curls on album covers, would hear her lament 
about loving foolishly, and then took a little bit more pride in my wild 
curls and foolish heart — except it was a more complicated and mature 
experience this time. Short hair comes with a lot of baggage for me.
My mother is a breast cancer survivor, and when she lost her hair 
to chemotherapy, what she got in return were damaging comments 
about her appearance from the people who were supposed to love her 
unconditionally. I will always flinch when I anticipate the same disease, 
when I picture myself losing my hair one day, and can only see loss in 
that image — I can’t see strength in it. Not yet. I know Lenker does 
not shave her hair because of breast cancer. But I can’t help thinking, 
when I stare up at her, that if I do inherit the disease and lose my hair 
to chemo maybe that’s not the same as losing my identity, or femininity.

And I realized as these thoughts raced through my head and this 
empowerment pulsed through me that it’s this: Big Thief is a band you 
can believe in. Adrianne Lenker is a person I don’t know, but can also 
believe in. I haven’t really believed in any musical artists since feeling 
personally betrayed by Taylor Swift’s 1989 in high school, but I closed 
my eyes in 2019 and listened to the woman on the stage in front of me, 
singing about imperfect families and real love being “a heart attack,” 
and I believed in her.
The Third Ode: To those with whom I share this band, this 
experience
I did not know what kind of crowd to expect the night of the concert, 
and found myself pleasantly surprised. I ran into a short story writer 
I knew. She asked me what Big Thief song I would choose, given all 
others would disappear, and seemed content with my knee-jerk 
answer, Capacity’s “Watering.” I saw one of my teachers, who gave me 
a hug with a beer in their hand and inquired how I found out about 
Big Thief, before benevolently shooing me with a promise to see me in 
class on Tuesday. I saw a boy I had a crush on in a creative writing class 
freshman year, who introduced me to his partner and shared his plans 
to get a music degree at another college.
I was happy to see a number of friends and acquaintances who 
identify as queer, looking happy and safe. I was happy to see a lot of 
nose rings — to see young people who looked like they were dressing 
the way they wanted to dress. I felt like I could have been in the living 
room of a co-op on my college campus, just with expanded dimensions 
and technical upgrades to rise to the occasion of Big Thief’s largeness, 
their majesty.
The people with whom I shared that space got me thinking about 
how it astonishes me: how much our love for other people becomes 
entangled with art. My unrestrained love for my mother. My forever-
tested love for my father. My fierce but well-meaning love for my 
brother. My inarticulate love for my friend who I know is responsible 
for changing my life, who I love and look up to in a kid-sister kind of 
way. I endow a variety of artists with these loves, but Big Thief is the 
only band with the strength and capacity to hold them all. 
Actually, I went to the concert with one of these friends. The day 
before the concert, both of us independently googled the setlists for 
their tour thus far, then immediately closed the tab after doing so. 
Another friend let us borrow his car to get there — magnanimity that 
day knew no bounds — and we tested ourselves on Big Thief lyrics the 
entire way there. We made our predictions, but decided the band could 
not possibly go wrong. At the concert, after almost every song, we’d 
turn to each other, usually exchanging a nod or a grin or words we 
couldn’t hear, but still understood. That was the greatest part: sharing 
it, without having to say anything.
On the way there, we talked about Big Thief lyrics and potential 
setlists, yes, but we talked about life things, too. Naturally, then, my 
romantic (anti-)developments of the last year came up. At one point in 
that conversation, we revisited one of the theories that arose from one 
of these failed pursuits, that relationships founded solely on the basis 
of shared musical interest always seem shakier.
“Like us with Big Thief,” he quickly interrupted. I laughed hard, 
and if I were someone who jokingly punched people’s arms, I would’ve 
done so, but I thought about it more, and, to a certain extent, he was 
right. 
I can meditate all I want on what this experience means to me, but 
the fact that I share its memory with someone I love is the whole thing, 
the biggest thing. The most it could possibly mean.
***
“Not to die, not dying,” she sang, and I didn’t think any of us were, 
but maybe Lenker felt like she had been before that moment, and 
maybe I have at times, too, and maybe we always are, but maybe I also 
believe she conquered that reality in that moment, with her voice and 
her music alone, and she carried me away with her. I wish you could 
have seen it and believed it. She would carry you, too.

Three odes to real love at last week’s Big Thief concert

CONCERT REVIEW

WIKIMEDIA COMMONS

Sometimes it’s hard to believe that Rex Orange County is only 
21 years old — he’s been singing so maturely on the strength of his 
love since he was barely 18. In the three short years since the stellar 
bcos u will never b free, Rex has become indie pop’s darling, stealing 
listeners’ hearts with his impassioned (and catchy) songwriting. A 
lot has happened in those three years. 18 is a crazy age to rocket into 
stardom, and once you’ve become a star, there’s no going back. Rex 
hasn’t shied away from singing about that pressure. But as the saying 
goes, pressure makes diamonds — and Pony is a diamond.
There’s one solemn theme that drives the writing on Pony: Rex 
missing his old life. It’s a message that runs deep throughout the 
album, maybe even deeper than his usual warm expressions of love for 

his girlfriend. Opener “10/10” and closer “It’s Not The Same Anymore” 
are the biggest meditations on this theme, and it’s probably no 
coincidence that he chose the two to sandwich the rest of the album. 
Rex’s voice is infused with melancholy as he sings, “I lost the joy in my 
face / My life was simple before.”
Love may be a universal language, but Rex is even more relatable in 
the ways he tackles nostalgia. His longing for the days of old feels even 
more personal, more intimate, yet so wide-reaching. The intimacy of 
his writing is reinforced by warm instrumentation. On “10/10,” the 
synth keys, snappy percussion and lush vocal harmonies give a veneer 
of ’80s energy while still sounding fresh. Pony’s production is all the 
more impressive when you look at the credits: Rex is a known multi-
instrument virtuoso, and almost all the central instruments are self-
performed.
Creating a musical mood is an art for Rex, using every sound to its 
fullest. “Laser Lights” is tinged with noir, featuring groovy saxophone 
and flute performances. The lyrics embody 
Rex’s songwriting style that is best described as 
“effortless.” His lines all have an innate rhythm, 
and he never has to stretch his delivery to say what 
he wants to say. He accomplishes this with lines 
that are at once simple and clever: “Arm to the face, 
when we have to speak I usually shoegaze / And 
if I saw you in public, I would pretend to tie my 
shoelace.”
Much like the innate rhythm in his writing, the 
tracks on Pony are expertly composed to build 
momentum, every song continuously expanding 
into something greater and greater. “It Gets 
Better” is a song that literally gets better as the 
instrumentation builds and builds. Starting with 
highly danceable percussion and piano chords, 
the song eventually explodes into an orchestral 
climax. There’s only one lengthy song on Pony at 
six minutes and 26 seconds, but Rex is poised to 
make magnificent and evolving music in the vein 

of Frank Ocean’s ten-minute masterpiece “Pyramids.”
Woven between the mellow writing on Pony is high-spirited 
celebration. “Never Had The Balls” is full of warmth and happiness. 
The sound of birds chirping pads the music, conjuring an image of a 
beautiful spring day. It feels like the sun shining down when the hook 
hits — if someone asked for an example of a chorus that blossoms, I 
would point them to “Never Had The Balls.”
The emotional high point of Pony is undoubtedly “Pluto Projector” 
— after first listen, it immediately made it onto my shortlist of songs 
to play at my wedding. It is laced in drama, starting with just a soft 
guitar and eventually introducing a sublime chamber orchestra. The 
angelic background vocals are even performed together by Rex and 
his girlfriend. Could it be any more romantic?
Pony is Rex in his element. For being so strongly tied to Rex in the 
present, the record’s songwriting is timeless. The song structures are 
familiar to pop listeners, but the ever-evolving nature of each track 
makes it feel more free-form. A sense of meticulous craftwork is in the 
bones of the music, making Pony a refined record for listeners of soft 
and delicate e-boy indie. Rex Orange County is quickly moving from 
indie-pop prince to king, and the crown looks damn good on him.

The nostalgic glow of ‘Pony’ is Rex at his most relatable

King Princess’s album promo video for Cheap 
Queen is pure satire. King Princess is in drag as 
she goes off into crisp banter with comedian 
Kate Berlant. The promo masterfully captures 
the intersection between women being clever 
and being sexy, the perfect introduction to the 
focal points of King Princess’s debut album. 
The album promo, along with cover art 
that features King Princess in a burlesque-
inspired outfit, immerses fans in the wonderful, 
underrepresented 
space 
of 
women 
being 
exceedingly funny without being labeled as 
annoying or trying to get in your bed. Burlesque, 
according to Wikipedia, is work “intended to 
cause laughter by caricaturing the manner or 
spirit of serious works. ” It has always been 
controversial, especially with its connection 
to strip clubs. With one quick Google search 
you can find an article titled, “Is Burlesque 
empowering or demeaning for women?” King 
Princess takes any notion of this condescension 
to those involved with burlesque and reverts it 
with Cheap Queen. The debut album is literally 
a vintage-inspired, empowering strip tease that 
sits at the intersection of comedy, sexiness and 
class. 
Among the satire in the album promo, King 
Princess weaves in small, quotable odes to the 
energy that guided this break-up album. At one 
moment she stares stone-cold at Kate Berlant 
to say, “Do you like my leg hair through the fish 
nets?” The next moment she acknowledges the 
liberating space she creates for her fans: “To 
see that my concerts like provide this space 
for young queer kids. Especially for dykes, it’s 
like, there has to be some sort of kind of haven 
to fucking rage. There’s something church-like 
about it.” 
Sexiness through mockery is completely 
authentic to Mikaela Straus (the real name 
behind King Princess). Watch any interview 
and you feel your panties drop while she mocks 
herself or boring music. In this way, her debut 
Cheap Queen feels completely authentic. She’s 
vulnerable in her authenticity and sadness, and 
that’s at the forefront of this debut. With Cheap 
Queen, King Princess takes the pressure away 
from being a hyper-feminine Instagram baddie 
and instead grasps the sexiness that lies in 
comedy and humility. It’s a lesbian heart-break 
album that crushes and empowers its listeners 
simultaneously.
This 
retro, 
going-backwards-to-move-
forward sort of female empowerment is woven 
throughout the listening experience of each 

track. Most notably, the title track “Cheap 
Queen” incorporates audio from an old-timey 
female movie, woefully spilling lyrics in the 
background like: “Smiling for the audience” or 
“cheap queen.”
One of my favorite tracks is “Hit The Back,” a 
dance track that’s clear and direct about exactly 
what her lover is missing now that they’re no 
longer together: “Ain’t I the best you had, and I 
let you throw it down, hit the back.” The Playboy 
School of Pop video that’s set to the tune of 
“Hit The Back” is even better; it displays King 
Princess dressing as a hot version of every high 
school trope, from cheerleader to basketball 
player. She’s anything she wants to be. She 
liberates her fans to feel the same. 
King Princess’s journey started when she 
exploded onto the scene after Harry Styles 
tweeted about her hit single “1950.” Now only 
20 years old, she’s on the rise, making music 
for “the queer kids in the front,” as she says. In 
the music video for “1950,” she rocked a small 
drawn-on mustache. Now, for Cheap Queen, she 
draws on fully arched eyebrows in full glam. 
She’s exactly what pop needs — she exists in a 
space that’s undefined and sexy as hell. King 
Princess writes catchy love struck tunes to 
female lovers. She’s always specific, always 
daring and never holds back. Fall on your knees, 
the reign of King Princess is here.

ALBUM REVIEW

Cheap Queen

King Princess

Columbia Records

Twenty years ago, Mike Judge created “Office 
Space,” the perfect distillation of the nine to five 
ennui that can sometimes veer into the surreal, all 
borne out of being trapped in a cubicle for most of 
the day. It was an unglamorous era for the humble 
programmer, before the excesses of the following 
decade set in.
Years later, Judge returned to a similar theme 
after the successes of his following projects with 
the HBO series “Silicon Valley.” The bleak dystopia 
is (seemingly) flipped on its head in the show’s 
titular location, with the bleak gray interiors of 
Initech replaced by the colorful, open office layouts, 
all-you-can-eat lunches of Hooli. Characters like 
Richard Hendricks (Thomas Middleditch, “Tag”) 
are trying to escape their jobs not out of extreme 
boredom, but rather the possibility of becoming 
the next iterations of the CEOs of the companies 
they work at. “Passion” and “energy” become 
the buzzwords of the day, with the “worthy” 
deservedly capturing the fruits that capitalism can 
endow.
Reading between the lines, however, one 

can come to realize that the world portrayed by 
“Silicon Valley” is its own type of dystopia, with 
the real-life effects of the real-life equivalents of 
the personalities of the show becoming a larger 
part of the national conversation. The brash, 
uncontainable ego of characters like Hooli CEO 
Gavin Belson (Matt Ross, “American Horror Story: 
Hotel”) are some of the best bits of the series, 
but when we see some of those elements in the 
Zuckerbergs and Bezoses of the world that Belson is 
presumably a caricature of, the consequences are a 
bit more dire. Or when the cartoonish greed of Russ 
Hanneman (Chris Diamantopoulos) is reflected in 
the Adam Neumanns of the world (who get billion 
dollar payouts to leave their companies while their 
employees lose their jobs), the utopianism that 
many companies, venture capital firms and other 
cogs of the tech ecosystem try to spread seems more 
and more like the front to ever-growing grifts.
Yet it is always difficult to not cheer for the 
protagonists of the series, however flanderized 
they’ve become. Maybe in their early days, this 
was itself the attitude towards the now despised 
Facebooks and Amazons of the world. One of the 
frustrating parts of the show is that since Pied 
Piper (the startup in the center of it all) never really 
passes the startup stage, we never see how the 
transition into potential global behemoth affects 
the attitudes and relationships of the characters (a 
la “The Social Network”).
“Silicon Valley” returns for its sixth and final 
season this week, and despite the relative downturn 
in quality of the previous two seasons, it is set up 
with a lot of promise for a final season to match 
the high bar set by its first few. Even between 
when it started five years ago and now, perceptions 
within and without “The Valley” about the societal 
impact (mostly negative ones) and responsibilities 
of the behemoths in the Bay Area have changed 
drastically, and the quirks of the characters that 
made them so endearing are not as funny anymore. 
There is a lot of room to explore these ideas as well 
as analyze the changing landscape in the tech 
world with the trademark wit and precision which 
Judge has shown time and time again.

TV NOTEBOOK

Earlier this week, I was talking to an old 
friend, and I told her that I had bought tickets to 
“Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker” for me and 
my whole family the instant they went on sale. 
She wasn’t surprised; I had done the same thing 
for many movies in the past, like “Star Wars: 
The Last Jedi,” “Beauty and the Beast” and 
“Avengers: Endgame.” I am what you would call a 
little bit obsessed with movie franchises, and my 
family — especially my sister — shares my love of 
Disney movies in particular.
However, 
during 
our 
conversation, 
she 
made an offhand remark asking me if I could 
remember the last Disney movie that I had seen 
that wasn’t part of a franchise or a reboot. I told 
her of course I could name one, and then I sat 
there in shock realizing that I couldn’t. I have 
since realized that, as far as I can remember, it 
was back in 2016 with Disney’s “Moana.”
By the end of 2019, Disney will have released 11 
movies in theaters (not including those of which 
are Fox properties, or Disney’s Fox releases): 
“Captain Marvel,” “Dumbo,” “Penguins” (a 
Disneynature 
film), 
“Avengers: 
Endgame,” 
“Aladdin,” “Toy Story 4,” “Spider-Man: Far From 
Home,” “The Lion King,” “Maleficent: Mistress 
of Evil,” “Frozen 2” and “Star Wars: The Rise of 
Skywalker.” The wide variety of movies looks 
impressive, but with the exception of “Penguins” 
(a documentary), there is not a single original 
movie in that list. Every single one of them is 
either part of a series or a reboot of a classic.
I personally love Disney films. It doesn’t 
matter to me if it’s a reboot or a sequel, if it’s 
animated or live-action: I love them all. But it is 
staggering to realize how many box-office hits in 
this day and age lack originality. All the Disney 
“Star Wars” movies are part of a larger franchise 
that began in the ’70s, and all the Disney Marvel 
movies are based on comic books dating back to 
1939. All the live-action, remade classic movies 
are based on old Disney cartoons. Even Disney, 
arguably one of the most imaginative and 
creative film companies, seems to be grasping at 
straws when it comes to moviemaking. They are 
sticking to franchises and reboots because they 
know that those are the kinds of movies that will 

get them a return on investment.
And to be fair, those movies are successful. 
Disney dominated the box-office in 2019; as of 
this week, the top six movies in the domestic box-
office charts this year are all Disney properties. 
They know what works to make money, and right 
now, it’s franchises and reboots.
Disney announced a number of upcoming 
films from 2019 to 2023 at its D23 expo earlier 
this year, and a majority of them fall under the 
franchise and reboot category. For instance, 
from 2020 to 2022, there are at least seven 
Marvel movies slated to come out, complete with 
release dates and everything. There are a few 
original movies sprinkled in, but not many. 
And with the addition of Disney+ (release date 
Nov. 12, 2019), even more franchise and reboot 
movies and television shows are to be released 
outside of theaters. Disney is really banking on 
the nostalgia factor and the franchise frenzy 
with a lot of the Disney+ content: a new “Lizzie 
McGuire” TV show, a “Star Wars” universe TV 
show “The Mandalorian,” a live-action “Lady 
and the Tramp” movie and a number of lower-
caliber Marvel heroes’ TV shows are just some of 
the new content to be added, not to mention the 
“oldie but goldie” Disney TV shows and movies 
that haven’t been on air or in theaters for years.
Disney is flourishing right now — that much 
is clear. But what will happen when the era of 
franchise and reboots finally ends? While they 
will probably always be a successful company, 
(how can they not be with entire theme 
parks based on their films?), they will have to 
understand their audience’s interests and make 
hasty adjustments based on what people want to 
see sooner or later.
Eventually, they’ll have to stop churning out 
sequels and remakes and finally create something 
new, something never-before seen. They’ve 
done it before: Back in 1950 when “Cinderella” 
came out, the scene where her ripped-up dress 
was transformed into her iconic ballroom dress 
amazed viewers, who had never seen animation 
like that. But that was 70 years ago. They’ll have 
to up their game a little, though I’m pretty sure 
they’ll catch up when the franchise era dies 
down.
In the meantime, I’ll still happily hop on the 
franchise train and see “The Rise of Skywalker” 
the night it comes out.

Disney has been very busy,
and the future looks bright

Errors crucial in failed upset bid

The 
Michigan 
volleyball 
team followed the example of its 
kills leader, sophomore outside 
hitter Paige Jones, on Sunday. 
Against No. 5 Wisconsin, the 
Wolverines’ upset hopes were 
dashed by a slew of errors and 
dominant play by the Badgers’ 
All-American 
junior 
middle 
blocker Dana Rettke.
Jones 
had 
a 
game-high 
21 kills for the Wolverines, 
showing 
some 
impressive 
spurts of genius against the 
heavily-favored 
Badgers 
en 
route to her second straight 
match with 20-plus kills. But 
she also led the team with nine 
errors in what ended up being a 
sloppy loss for Michigan.
“I think we as a team were a 
little high-air,” said Michigan 
coach Mark Rosen. “... And 
that’s where I thought Paige 
could have been a little bit 
better.” 
“High-air” was a nice way 
of 
putting 
the 
Wolverines’ 
struggles. 
They 
totaled 
29 
attack errors to the Badgers’ 

nine. Michigan also had only 
one service ace and 12 service 
errors, giving away too many 
free points to a Wisconsin team 
that certainly didn’t need the 
help. The Wolverines were 
outhit by the Badgers, .372-.176, 
as well. 
And 
despite 
some 
solid 
runs throughout the game, 
Michigan’s passing was poor 
at times — a sin the Wolverines 
could 
ill-afford 
to 
commit 
against the sound and skilled 
Badgers.
“A lot of teams don’t always 
capitalize in those situations,” 
Rosen said. “... We’re in trouble 
and we can kind of bang out of 
it and be OK. (Wisconsin) is a 
team where it’s hard to bang 
out of trouble.”
But even in the desperation 
of a fourth loss in five games, 
the 
Wolverines 
were 
able 
to take solace in the bright 
spots that Jones and the rest 
of 
Michigan’s 
young 
stars 
exhibited. Even though Jones 
had difficulty with controlling 
the ball, she marked the fourth 
20-kill match of her young 
career. 

“She’s scoring a lot for us 
right now,” Rosen said. “She’s 
carrying a big load for us.” 
Two 
other 
youngsters, 
freshman outside hitter May 
Pertofsky and freshman middle 
blocker Jess Robinson also had 
solid performances. Pertofsky 
and Robinson had eight kills 
apiece, but they combined for 
nine errors of their own. Even 
so, this front-court trio for the 
Wolverines has been learning 
and progressing at a strong rate.
The 
difference 
in 
skill 
between the current iterations 
of 
both 
Michigan 
and 
Wisconsin 
is 
obvious; 
the 
Wolverines just aren’t on the 
Badgers’ level. But Jones and 
the other young players showed 
enough in the loss to give the 
Wolverines a positive outlook 
on the future, even if there are 
some growing pains along the 
way. 
“We’re very excited about 
what they’re doing,” Rosen 
said. “... I like how this team 
is progressing. I like how this 
team is approaching things, I 
like how they’re approaching 
losses.”

Quick Hits

The Daily hockey beat used 
to run a video series during the 
2011-12 season called “Quick 
Hits.” 
It was a series of one-on-one 
interviews with players that 
covered everyday life and all of 
its funny moments. But now, for 
budget reasons, it’s in written 
format. 
And for the first season in 
three years — despite the pleas 
of the editors — Quick Hits are 
back. 
For the second edition, The 
Daily sat down with three 
members 
of 
the 
sophomore 
class, goaltender Strauss Mann, 
forward 
Nolan 
Moyle 
and 
defenseman Nick Blankenburg — 
based on the frequency of their 
photos together on Instagram — 
to talk about some pretty spooky 
stuff.
***
Tien was feeling really festive 
for Halloween and brought a 
cowboy hat and crown to interview 
the players. When they walked in, 
they noticed immediately.
Blankenburg: 
Ooooh, 
a 
crown. Is that for one of us to 
wear?
Mann: That crown is for you, 
Moyle. 
Moyle: No, that’s for you lad.
Feeling that these first-time 
Quick Hits victims didn’t know 
what was going on, Tien Le and 
Molly “Michigan” Shea offered up 
a quick explanation of Quick Hits 
before getting into it.
***
Molly: 
If 
the 
team 
was 
trapped in a horror movie who 
would be the first person to get 
killed/go missing?
Blankenburg: Jack Olmstead.
Moyle: Jack Leavy, for sure.
Mann: Yeah, either one of 
those guys. 
Blankenburg: 
I 
think 
Olmstead 
and 
Leavy 
are 
definitely the main two.

Moyle: Maybe Strauss.
Mann: I feel like they’d think 
they had a smart idea to get out of 
there or something, and it would 
just go completely wrong.
Tien: Okay, who on the team 
would be most likely to cry in a 
haunted house?
Moyle: Jack Leavy. Again.
Tien: Is he really easy to 
scare?
Mann: Uhhhh...
Moyle: He just wouldn’t know 
what to expect, and then he’d 
probably get terrified.
Blankenburg: I feel like any 
being scared questions, or crying 
questions relate to Jack Leavy 
and Jack Olmstead. 
Moyle: Oh yeah.
Tien: Molly had to get dragged 
out of a haunted house one time 
because she was so scared she 
was on the floor crying.
Blankenburg: Oh.
Mann: Nice, nice.
Molly: Hey! I was really 
young!
Molly: Do you guys believe 
in any conspiracy theories? Like 
is the moon landing fake? Is the 
Earth flat?
Blankenburg: Uhh, I don’t 
know. I try not to get into that 
stuff. It’s not my cup of tea.
Moyle: The Titanic was fake, 
I think. 
Molly: Woah.
Mann: Yeah, that’s not up my 
alley.
Blankenburg: 
I 
know 
Jake Gingell is a big, big, big 
conspiracy theory guy, so I think 
that’d be the guy you would ask. 
He watches alien documentaries 
and always talks about aliens and 
stuff like that.
Tien: 
What’s 
the 
worst 
Halloween candy?
Blankenburg: I don’t like 
candy corn.
Mann: Really? You don’t?
Blankenburg: Yeah, I’m just 
not a big fan of candy corn.
Mann: Black licorice.
A key fact left out is that Mann 
follows a very strict diet that 

doesn’t include any food otherwise 
touched by humans besides to cook 
it, so, in other words, no candy.
Molly: Well that’s just the 
worst candy in general.
Mann: Well, that’s any candy 
so… 
Moyle: I don’t know, those 
Rolo things are pretty heinous.
Blankenburg 
*clearly 
offended 
by 
Moyle’s 
suggestion*: 
Wait, 
fruit 
roll-ups?? 
Fruit 
roll-ups 
are 
unbelievable.
Mann: Tootsie Rolls??
Moyle: No, no, no.
Blankenburg: Tootsie Rolls 
are sooooo bad too, though.
Mann: They’re so good, sooo 
good.
Tien: They’re a classic.
Blankenburg: Tootsie Rolls 
are ... I don’t even know.
Molly: What are you guys 
going to be for Halloween this 
year?
Blankenburg: 
White 
Goodman. 
Molly: Who’s that?
Blankenburg: He’s on the 
Purple Cobras from the movie 
‘Dodgeball’.
Mann: I’m going to be the 
Love Guru. Mariska Hargitay….
Mariska Hargitay.
Blankenburg: I don’t know. 
We won’t really have the chance 
to go out here, I mean, Halloween 
is, Thursday? Yeah we’re going to 
leave for Ohio State. Oh! Maybe 
I’ll wear a nice costume on the 
bus or something. Maybe we 
should all do that.
Mann: For Halloween, you 
(Blankenburg) 
can 
just 
be 
yourself. That’d be pretty scary.
Head athletic trainer Brian 
Brewster walks into the room.
Blankenburg: Hey! Should 
we do that, wear Halloween 
costumes on the bus?
Brewster: I’d like to see you 
lead the charge on that.
Blankenburg: 
I 
might, 
I 
might.
Molly: Strauss, what did you 
honestly think of when Tien 

asked to race you at the meet the 
players skate?
Mann: Ummm, I was just like 
‘Uhh I really don’t wanna do this, 
but...’
Blankenburg: Actually, he 
got nervous. Afraid he was going 
to lose.
Mann: Well, I did lose. I was 
just like, ‘I don’t know, I can be 
a nice guy and do it.’ It’s tough 
with all the goalie gear on. After 
the game, you (Tien), had me at 
my worst moment.
Tien: In my story I said, ‘To be 
fair, you were in pads and stuff.’
Tien: What’s the scariest thing 
that’s ever happened to you?
Mann: Scariest moment….
Blankenburg: 
I 
think 
I 
thought someone was trying 
to break into my house. One 
time, when I was home alone, I 
was down in my basement, and 
someone rang the doorbell. And 
when you’re a kid, and you’re 
home alone, you automatically 
think someone’s trying to break 
into your house. But … it was just 
the mailman or something.
Tien: Someone actually broke 
into my house two years ago.
Blankenburg: Oh really? 
Tien: Two years ago in Ann 
Arbor, yeah.
Blankenburg: Other than that 

fake break-in, I haven’t really had 
too much scary stuff.
Moyle: 
I 
can’t 
think 
of 
anything like really scary. 
Mann: Uhhh ... I’m thinking. 
Maybe anytime my junior hockey 
coach talked to me. I was afraid 
I’d get traded or something. *long 
pause* But he was a good guy. 
Make sure you put that in there, 
please.
Molly: 
Blankenburg 
and 
Moyle, if you had to be goalie 
for the day, who would you least 

want to face a shot from?
Moyle: Johnny Beecher.
Mann: Oh, for sure.
Moyle: His shot split open 
Hayden’s head last week.
Tien: Oh right, he had to get 
six stitches by his eye.
Blankenburg: Slaker or Will.
Moyle: Oh, or Becker.
Molly: Alright, that’s all we 
have for you guys.
Mann *shakes his head*: 
Good luck writing this story. We 
didn’t give you anything good.

The hockey beat is back with Quick Hits, this time leaning into spooky season to unearth the team’s fears and frights

With legs, Patterson aids offense

As Tru Wilson took the 
handoff and cut through the 
teeth of Notre Dame’s defense, 
Shea 
Patterson 
sprinted 
downfield ahead of his running 
back. When Wilson approached 
the end zone, Patterson threw 
a block on the last remaining 
defender. Wilson coasted in for 
a touchdown.
Early 
in 
the 
season, 
Patterson 
seemed 
reluctant 
to put his body on the line. 
He was hesitant to keep the 
ball even on read-options that 
appeared to be open for a keep. 
He certainly didn’t block for 
touchdowns like he did on 
Saturday or risk an eye-gouging 
on a quarterback sneak, like 
last week at Penn State.
But now, Michigan’s senior 
quarterback is back to his fast 
and physical ways, and it’s been 
nothing but a boon to his team.
“I think (the quarterback 
run) was especially important 
in this game and something 
we’d talked about and Shea 
embraced, and he read the 
ball,” said Michigan coach Jim 
Harbaugh on Monday. “If both 
sides know that you’re running, 
having 
that 
quarterback 
as a potential 
threat 
for 
a 
runner is key. … 
I thought it was 
his fastest game 
he’s played as a 
runner and he’s 
moving around, 
scrambles. You 
could tell when 
he got the block 
that it was at least a distraction 
on Tru’s touchdown. He was 
really moving.”
Some of Patterson’s early 
hesitance may have been due 
to an oblique injury sustained 
in the season opener against 
Middle Tennessee. Last week, 
Patterson said that the game in 
State College was the first time 

all year he was at 100 percent.
Regardless 
of 
whether 
the 
early 
absence 
of 
the 
quarterback 
run 
was 
due 
to injury, missed reads or 
something else entirely, there’s 
no question that aspect of 
Patterson’s 
game 
is 
back. 
Against the Nittany Lions and 
Fighting Irish, he rushed for 
41 and 28 sack-adjusted yards, 
respectively. And on Saturday, 
in a throwback to last year, 
Patterson kept 
the ball on a 
read-option 
in the second 
quarter 
for 
a 
22-yard 
gain. 
The 
run 
set 
the Wolverines 
up with first-
and-goal at the 
2-yard 
line, 
eventually 
leading 
to 
a 
touchdown that put Michigan 
up, 17-0.
“The quarterback run game 
is a pretty big part of what we 
do,” said redshirt freshman 
offensive 
tackle 
Jalen 
Mayfield. “And we missed a 
couple 
opportunities 
early 

in the season, weren’t able to 
hold the ball, but (Patterson 

has) done an unbelievable 
job of watching that film and 
picking up on the things he did 
wrong early in the season. And 
for him being the big leader 
that he is in the locker room ... 
just asserting himself like that 
is gonna be a big part of our 
success.”
The presence of a dual-
threat 
signal-caller 
gives 
the defense another thing 
to 
worry 
about 
and 
can 
confuse opposing teams with 
looks they haven’t seen. The 
re-addition of that element of 
Patterson’s game has opened 
up the Wolverines’ rushing 
attack after a few lackluster 
early-season games. And it’s 
been beneficial for Patterson, 
too. As he’s increasingly made 
the right reads and found 
success, his confidence has 
only grown.
“I feel like he’s the best 
there is,” Wilson said. “He’s 
the 
man. 
But 
physically, 
mentally, his confidence is at a 
high, he’s throwing the ball as 
good as could be, I thought he 
threw the ball really well for 
being as rainy as it was. That’s 
really bad conditions. So yeah, 
I think he’s the man and he can 
do it all.”

It’s 

year one under coach 

Juwan Howard, and the question on 
everyone’s mind seems to be what on 
Earth is this new team going to look 
like?

Will it be characterized by 

deliberate possessions on offense 
with complex schemes that only a few 
of basketball’s elite may understand 
or will it be more up-tempo, 
emphasizing the 3-point shot? Will 
the team run man-to-man defensive 
coverage or will it play a zone? For 
crying out loud, who’s even going to 
be starting?

In the weeks leading up to the 

season, one figure on Michigan’s staff 
may provide some early answers. And 
that’s associate coach Phil Martelli.

Having spent the last 24 years 

as the head coach at St. Joseph’s, a 
mid-major program in Philadelphia, 
Martelli has seen it all. He coached 
one of only 25 teams to finish the 
regular season undefeated with his 
2003-04 squad and has led many 
players to the next level.

While it’s still too early to tell, this 

perhaps made the hiring of Martelli 
such a great move for Juwan’s rookie 
campaign as a coach. In addition to 
contributing sage wisdom, as a man 
whose name is synonymous with 
veteran coaching ability, Martelli 
may have a hand in designing this 
season’s offense and defense.

To figure out what that may look 

like, The Daily broke down some 
old St. Joe’s game footage between 
the Hawks and Saint Louis in 2018 
because, well, it was one of the only 
ones available on YouTube. It’s not a 
game of any particular significance, 
just a regular season game where St. 
Joe’s lost, 68-57.

The analysis will include what 

Martelli could bring to both sides of 
the ball this season as well as how 
his system would have potentially 
worked with Michigan’s 2018-19 
roster.

Offense

We’ll start with 

offense, 
because, 

while 
defense 
is 

great, it surely is not 

going to keep you hooked 

on this article. And Martelli 
agrees. On Friday, speaking 
to 
The 
Daily, 
Martelli 

dropped this nugget.

“Coaches 
might 
scream 

that 
you 
don’t 
deserve 
to 

coach when I make this next 
statement,” Martelli said, “but 

that old statement of, ‘Defense wins 
championships,’ I’m not dead-sold on 
that. I’ve never seen a championship 
won 6-4. You have to score.”

Right he is. And one of the 

primary ways he did that at St. Joe’s 
was through staggered ball screen 
processions, frequent ball movement 
and a ball-dominant point guard.

Martelli did not always have the 

most size or strength with his players, 
but the guards he did recruit could 
often times flat-out play. This is 
evident in his ‘03 squad that ran with 
four guards on the floor most of the 
time.

Here, let’s look at a passing play 

that led to a pick-and-roll play with 
an easy basket (see top right of page). 
First, the point guard dribbles down 
to the wing, handing the ball off to the 
‘2’ who takes it to the key and passes 
to the ‘3.’ The ‘3’ then hands it back to 
the point guard who is coming back 
up to the key, then plays around a 
pick set by the ‘5.’ The big then rolls to 
the basket where he’s greeted by the 
name “Spalding,” hurling at him.

As the style of play in college 

basketball has changed over the 
years, the pick-and-roll has become 
an instrumental tool in any offense 
due to its hard-to-guard nature and 
versatility. Nobody understands that 
better than Phil Martelli and, so it 
seems, Juwan Howard.

“The offense that we’re running 

now is really from Juwan’s and 
(assistant coach) Howard Eisley’s 
background,” 
Martelli 
said. 

“Conceptually, though, it’s what 
you’re saying. The ball screen is 
a big part. The ball screen is a big 
part of the NBA, big part of college 
basketball. Hard to guard. The double 
away action that you speak about is 
hard to guard.”

Now 
working 
with 
a 
ball-

dominant, experienced guard in 
senior Zavier Simpson, Martelli 
is surely excited at the thought of 
coaching a player like Simpson who 
would surely be a fixture of St. Joe’s 

scheme.

An additional aspect of the offense 

that Martelli has witnessed in his 
brief time with the Wolverines but 
failed to fully implement himself is 
the after-timeout (ATO) play. ATO 
plays have become a crucial part of 
the college and professional game, 
and with all the old NBA talent now 
at the helm of the program, seem to be 
queued up for a big release.

Defense
On the defensive side of the ball, 

Martelli maintains that his schemes 
were often dictated by the skill level 
and size of his players. So he knows 
exactly what he’d do if he were in 
charge of implementing the defense 
at Michigan.

“I would build my defense, man-

to-man,” Martelli said. “As we’re 
looking at some multiple defenses, I 
would be a man-to-man team with a 
kind-of zone to take the other team 
out of rhythm.”

And Martelli has and will have 

the chance to defend these schemes, 
seeing as all of the coaches draw on 
their individual experiences in order 
to pitch Howard on how to best run 
the team.

One aspect of St. Joes’ defense that 

may make its way into Crisler Center 
this season is the act of trapping 
the baseline. A prominent feature 
of Martelli’s defense, trapping the 
baseline took the Saint Louis offense 
out of rhythm and forced it into 
making riskier passes (see top left of 
page).

In this play, once the ball is passed 

to the big man, the Hawks’ guard 
comes down to trap the ball. In the 
Saint Louis game, this forced the 
Billikens’ ball-handler to dribble to 
the outside and pass to the open man 
who then missed a deep three.

So if you see the Wolverines 

trapping the baseline this season, you 
know who to thank.

How Martelli’s System Could 

Improve

When seeing how last year’s St. 

Joe’s team compares to last year’s 
Michigan 
team, 
the 
differences 

are glaring and largely explain the 
disparity in success.

For starters, the Hawks lacked skill 

at the point guard position. To be fair, 
most teams trail the Wolverines in 
this regard with Simpson emerging 
as one of the nation’s best. But once 
the film is pulled up, the evidence is 
damning.

In the game, there’s a play where 

St. Joe’s point guard Jared Bynum 
drives to the basket. His shot selection 

is poor due to an awkward angle 
towards the hoop, forcing an off-
balance shot. In a similar situation, 
Simpson’s attempts offer a different 
solution — his high-percentage hook 
shot.

Clearly 
outmatched 
and 
off-

balance, Bynum’s shot had a ghost of 
a chance to connect. Simpson, on the 
other hand, knowingly outsized, has 
mastered his move.

While yes, this is just a series 

of cherry-picked shots, last year’s 
stats tell the whole story. Simpson 
led Bynum in nearly all advanced 
statistics 
including 
win 
shares 

and player efficiency rating. While 
Bynum edged out Simpson in points 
per game, Simpson dominated in 
nearly every aspect of the offense 
particularly in assists where he 
averaged 6.6 per game.

One additional difference between 

Martelli’s 
teams 
and 
Michigan 

currently is the lack of size.

In 
the 
matchup, 
there 
was 

one instance where the Billikens 
collected three straight offensive 
boards, easily grabbing boards over 
their opponents. Just imagine you’re 
a lifelong Hawks fan, you’re watching 
your players compete down low and 
just try not to get frustrated.

Pretty hard, right?
The player at the ‘5’ here, Lorenzo 

Edwards, is only 6-foot-7. Jon Teske, 
on the other hand, is 7-foot-1. It’s 
hard to imagine the Billikens get so 
many chances with an additional four 
inches crashing the glass on every 
play. 

And just for fun, there was another 

play of an attempted alley-oop where 
the intended recipient, guard Charlie 
Brown Jr., whiffs on the attempt.

Replace 
Brown 
with 
junior 

forward Isaiah Livers or last year’s 
standout Ignas Brazdeikis or even 
Teske and tell me the play doesn’t go 
down a little differently. 

It’s 
just 
harder 
to 
get 
the 

athleticism seen night-in and night-
out on Michigan’s roster at mid-major 
programs. Not to say there isn’t talent 
at this level, but a more athletic duo 
completes that play. And no one 
knows this better than Martelli.

So this season, when Martelli 

is sitting on the bench for the first 
time in 24 years instead of standing 
and screaming on the sidelines, it’s 
important to acknowledge what 
contributions he will be making to 
this team. And when he says, “If I had 
Michigan’s players at St. Joe’s, I’d still 
be the coach at St. Joe’s,” just know 
he’s probably telling the truth.

THE MICHIGAN DAILY | OCTOBER 30, 2019

T

hough I write “flutist” on my 
resume, “professional scaredy-
cat” might be more accurate.
I’m sure any musician remembers their 
first performance vividly. My memory, 
however, is a bit too vivid and not in a good 
way. After weeks of hesitation, I mustered 
up my courage and asked my teacher for a 
performance opportunity at a local church. 
As the director of music there, he happily 
put my name down on the Sunday program 
and I received the music score right away. I 
was self-conscious about my lack of perfor-
mance experience, so I practiced endlessly 
(Apologies to the girl who lived right above 
the music room — she was definitely sick 
of the melody). Beginning Saturday night 
after dinner, I started to feel a bit uneasy. 
But somehow, I managed to calm myself 
and slip into a good night’s sleep. I hoped 
everything would be just dandy the next 
morning.
“I got this!” I said to my reflection in the 
mirror before wrapping myself with the 

blanket.
Sadly, as soon as I woke up the next 
morning, the Freudian unconsciousness 
revealed its ugliness. I wasn’t thinking 
about the performance while chewing my 
breakfast eggs and toast, but my heart was 
beating at an unusual pace. As 10 o’clock 
approached, its rhythm increased. Linearly.
Oh boy.
I decided to make myself look pretty 
first. I put on my favorite dress from Free 
People and gave myself a final mirror-
check. Strangely, the phoenix pattern on 
the dress seemed a bit less glorious than it 
was two days ago on the hanger. I did not 
have the choice to back out and be a cow-
ard, so I grunted and headed toward the 
church. The uphill route did not help. If I 
had graphed my heart rate, the function 
would have transformed from a linear one 
to an exponential one.
The choir was already there in their 
robes, chatting and giggling. I quietly 
assembled my flute and sat at the bench. I 

was hoping to blend into the back-
ground, which may have been pos-
sible if I weren’t wearing a colorful 
phoenix dress.
“There you are, Ivy!”
With the whole choir staring at 
me, my teacher asked me to play 
the note “A” to tune with the piano. 
To anyone who plays an orchestral 
instrument, the “A” note must be 
familiar — this tuning note signi-
fies the start of a performance or a 
rehearsal. I, however, did not know 
such a thing as the “tuning note.” 
So my first reaction was to produce 
a frowning, confused face.
Fair enough. But I was surely 
capable of playing a single note, 
wasn’t I?
No. And here’s why. On the 
piano, you can produce a sound, 
maybe even a good one by simply 
pressing down a key. However, the 
flute requires mastery of breathing. 
A slight change in the air stream 
may result in a catastrophic sound. 
Learning how to properly breathe 
was already difficult enough dur-
ing practice. How did I think my 
delicate breath would react when 
it was being chased by the giant, 
spooky monster of nervousness?
Shake was all I did. I had a shaky brain, 
10 shaky fingers, two shaky lips and a shaky 
stream of air. I played that A note (sort of) 
in a pitiful way. The flowy melody that 
I was capable of producing during prac-
tice sessions fell into pieces. Oh, if only I 
could’ve hid behind the piano! I shook so 
violently that the slur became staccato. 
The 20 seconds of my solo felt like an eter-
nity. Thankfully, the choir sang so loud 
and enthusiastic that their voice drowned 
my fragmented notes. I have never felt so 
grateful for a singing voice before.
Anyone would guess after that experi-
ence, I’d avoid public performance when-
ever possible. Wrong. I forgot about my 
pain too quickly. Only after a few weeks, 
I signed up for my high school graduation 
performance to play “Variations For Flute 
and Piano”, a challenging piece by Chopin. I 
was determined I would conquer my adren-
aline this time. Chopin may have liked my 

courage, but he definitely would have yelled 
at me: “Girl, not my piece. Play something 
simpler!” 
As if my last performance wasn’t trau-
matic enough, this time, I took my shaki-
ness to a stage with an audience of 400. 
All of them were students, faculty and par-
ents of the graduating class, and they were 
all watching the girl who stood under the 
brightest spotlight. But instead of rocking 
the stage, she went completely catatonic 
and lost her rhythm. Chopin and I left an 
eternal mark in the program pamphlet. I 
sincerely hope he won’t be angry at me. It 
was far beyond embarrassing.
I, the so-called performance musician, 
am utterly crippled by stage fright.
But I am not alone. The famed tenor, 
Luciano Pavarotti, threw up backstage 
before his performances. Ozzy Osbourne 
wrote in his biography: “to say that I suf-
fer from pre-show nerves is like saying that 
when you get hit by an atom bomb it hurts a 
bit.” I suppose that’s why stage fright is kind 
of a cliché. Knowing how these masters 
suffered does offer me a little relief. Unfor-
tunately, understanding that fear is com-
mon isn’t exactly a remedy for fear itself. 
I can’t help but wonder if it was magic, or 
maybe performance-enhancement drugs, 
that allowed them to ultimately put on such 
magnificent shows.
The answer, I believe, is neither. How 
these introverted artists pushed themselves 
onstage, despite shaky muscles, ice-cold 
hands, and racing hearts, is miraculous. It’s 
also the most human thing I can imagine. 
They set their finger to the keys, or the fret-
board, and draw a deep breath. It’s terrify-
ing, but they push through. The notes will 
only linger for a moment, but the music will 
outlive them for hundreds of years. That is 
the paradox of creativity — despite great 
fear, something fragile within us demands 
to be created. That desire is strong enough 
to conquer adrenaline. That’s why, despite 
the judgmental eyes of the audience, and 
despite my ice-cold fingertips, I continue to 
perform. That’s why I raise my flute in the 
spotlight — to imitate so many scaredy-cats 
before me, each of whom chose to be brave, 
for one moment, and leave beautiful music 
behind.

A shaky flutist

S

ilence is hard to find as a college student. Days 
pass by to a soundtrack of lecturing professor 
voices, giggling cliques in coffee shops and the 
deep bass of a song pumping through the floorboards 
from the upstairs neighbors. Even the library, where 
we would normally go to seek out silence, is steeped 
in the constant murmur of tapping keyboards and 
muted coughs. 
Though on further consideration, it’s hard to think 
of a situation where anyone can truly experience 
real, absolute silence. There’s always the distant 
roar of traffic, or birds chirping, or the whir of air 
conditioning. Complete silence simply cannot be 
achieved in the modern world, at least in any sector 
of the modern world I’m familiar with, without 
deliberately shutting oneself in a soundproof chamber 
engineered with walls to filter out any and all noise 
interference. 
So why is it, then, that the noise of college feels so 
particularly loud?
For the most part, the noise feels like a good thing. 
If I were to craft a map of the various sounds that 
pass through my ears while I am in Ann Arbor on any 
given day, a large part of that map would be dedicated 
to friends’ voices and real genuine laughter, a catchy 
new song on my Spotify Discover Weekly playlist and 
professors lecturing on how to change the world. 
But the noise that surrounds us in college isn’t 
always the kind that comes 
in through our ears. It is the 
noise of deadlines for papers on 
American race relations in the 
post-Civil War era. The noise of 
Facebook events for policy talks, 
networking opportunities and 
Rick’s pregames. The noise of 
unanswered texts and the noise 
of unfinished job applications. 
And 
this 
noise 
can 
be 
overwhelming 
— 
crippling, 
even. As a relatively anxious 
person, it often feels like all 
this stimuli prevents me from 
accomplishing even the simplest 
task — there is always so much 
going on, so much to process. 
Recently, the noise of a coding 
project, calls about organizing 
meetings and messages from 
my adviser about my thesis 
cumulated to the point where 
I sat and stared at a blank page 
on my laptop for the better part 
of an hour. And I’m well aware 
that I’m not the only one that 
feels this way — I imagine that 
it’s not a stretch to say that most, 
if not all, University of Michigan 
students find this atmosphere 
overwhelming at times. 
And yet, despite the anxiety-
inducing aspect of all this 
noise, I actively seek it out. I 
queue up the latest episode of 
“This American Life” before 
opening the front door of my 
house to walk to class. I avoid 

the quietest place on campus —the Law Library — 
preferring instead coffee shops and friends’ living 
rooms to do my assignments. Even while studying 
with friends, I’m notorious for starting conversations 
mid-work flow to bridge any silence that lasts longer 
than a few minutes. If I’m in my room, I almost always 
have music playing in the background — something 
instrumental if I’m trying to be productive, maybe 
some old school hip-hop if I’m in the mood for spice. 
Why do I so relentlessly pursue this noise, the noise 
that also persistently wears me down? 
It’s the quiet parts of college that are the most 
terrifying — the nights sitting alone in my room, 
knowing that people are out connecting and laughing 
and drinking in a world that I’m not part of. When I’m 
sitting alone in the library and the silence becomes so 
oppressive that all I can hear is the sound of deadlines 
stacking up. 
It’s harder to get lost in my own head when there’s 
so much noise to process on the outside.
But that wasn’t always the case. Before coming to 
college, my life was significantly less noisy. I didn’t 
have a ton of close friends, but I also didn’t have 
the same quantity of deadlines or applications or 
extracurriculars. I didn’t go to a single party in high 
school, at least the kind with alcohol and dancing and 
loud music.
The silence was peaceful, but it was also 

fundamentally lonely. Silence can feel confining, 
isolating. 
And then I came to Ann Arbor, to college, and the 
volume knob turned up 20 notches. 
By embracing the noise of this stage of my life, 
bad parts and all, I keep reminding myself that this 
is where I am now — surrounded by people and 
opportunities and things. I’m a part of a community 
and now have real friends and real connections with 
people.
I’m trying to become more comfortable with silence 
— letting myself walk to class without headphones, 
studying for a test by myself rather than with others. 
After a few recent experiences where the noise just 
got too loud and I didn’t finish assignments, or let 
friends down, I’m realizing that I need to tune it out 
sometimes, for my own sanity. Turn the volume knob 
down a couple notches.
But for the most part, I’m comfortable with keeping 
the volume where it is. This is my senior year at the 
University, and I don’t know what the next stage is 
going to sound like — if it will be quieter, or perhaps 
worse, louder and unfamiliar. 
So for the moment, I’m embracing the noise. In 
moderation. College is loud and crazy and stressful, 
but it also feels right. And maybe someday it will feel 
right to turn that volume knob down some more, but 
today it doesn’t — so I’m keeping the sound on.

I 

watched Tidying Up with Marie Kondo on Netflix 
for all of three minutes before shutting it off. The self-
awareness crept like heat onto my neck — I knew I’d 
never be that tidy. I’d never be “minimal.” 
Marie Kondo and I are polar opposites. She is a known 
advocate for getting rid of things that don’t “spark joy” and 
led the social media millennial boom of minimalism and 
organization. I, on the other hand, could make a case for each 
and every pointless item in my attic bedroom, arguing that they 
all spark some form of joy. 
I have trouble letting go of things. I still have a palm sized, 
plastic Japanese Mankei-Neko — those small plastic golden 
cats that wave their arm — that my friend brought me back 
from China when we were 13. It’s sat atop every single one 
of my desks, always next to a flamingo jewelry holder for my 
single pair of earrings, four boob-shaped mugs that I don’t use 
for drinking, a collection of bookmarks, a collection of colored 
pens from my coloring phase and a lip mask I’ll never put on. 
I couldn’t imagine ever ridding myself of the golden cat or the 
bookmarks. They feel like a part of me, in a strange way. 
The things I’ve stored under my bed at home are even more 
unnecessary. In the bursting clear tub I’ve tried my best to 
contain and forget about, you’ll find a stuck together napkin 
from a first date with a person I haven’t seen in a year. There’s 
a flashlight on a tattered black rope from an eighth-grade 
birthday party, and New Year’s Eve glasses from the years 2012-

2017, all ultimately dysfunctional, as they’re missing lenses. 
I’ve kept every notebook I’ve ever written in, an instructional 
pamphlet — written in Dutch — describing a dollhouse that I 
found in the remains of a fire in my hometown, the ribbon from 
a gift someone I sort of know gave me for my birthday, along 
with every birthday card I’ve ever received, every friendship 
bracelet I’ve ever made or taken off, photo booth pictures from 
a mall that no longer exists with a person I haven’t spoken to 
since 2008 and so much damn paper. You’ll find invitations, 
take-out menus, a half-written poem, coupons from a place 
I’ve only been to once, handwritten notes from my sixth-grade 
crush, a movie ticket from the midnight showing of Hunger 
Games, a 2010 Halloween card from my grandmother, tickets 
to the American Idol World Tour in 2007 –– part of me wants to 
just recycle it all, but part of me could never approach that blue 
trash bin and let go.
My aversion to throwing away useless monuments becomes 
emotionally destructive in my inability to discard ex-boyfriend’s 
sweatshirts, written notes, dead flower stems and teddy bears. 
During my freshman year of college, my mother texted me, “Is 
it okay to get rid of the Christian Brothers Academy sweatshirt 
and teddy bear from boyfriend #2?” The relationship lasted five 
passionless months at age 16, and yet, at 19, I had some far-off 
feeling that these objects, in fact, sparked enough joy to collect 
dust in the back of my closet. I had dated other boys since that 
lanky 16-year-old. All those things really did was take up space. 
When I’m home, I covertly sit on my floor in my bedroom 
and go through the boxes under my bed, peering through the 
windows of my past. Rooting through a box of yearbooks from 
middle school this summer, I came across a grammatically 
incorrect “52 things I love about you” deck of cards from my 
13-year-old first kiss. This happened over eight years ago, 
and I don’t even have that kid’s phone number anymore. The 
“you’re smile” as one of the 52 reasons seemed too wonderfully 
romantic to throw away, but now, as I come across them as a 
young adult, the sheer naivete and painful innocence of the 
gesture is something I can’t part with. Senior year of high 
school I tried to convince my 18-year-old fling to give me a 
Clemson sweatshirt. He said no, which is for the best because 
I’d probably still have it, rolled in a ball in the back of a drawer, 
and I hate the color orange anyway. 
Even when I move on, when months and years and feelings 
pass, I can’t seem to part ways with all the insignificant 
trinkets embedded in the gifted and borrowed objects from 
my old flames. It’s almost as though I fear my memory will fail 
me and I need reminders to dredge my mind and recover all 
the sweetest things. That’s how half of me feels. But the other 
half wonders. Was sloppily making out with someone on a 
basement couch on Saturday nights when you were 16 one of 
the sweetest things? I hope not. Does a fraternity T-shirt evoke 
such passionate memories? No. 
The common sense advice is that when you breakup you 
immediately throw away or return their stuff and the gifts they 
gave you. That’s what my best friend and mother have always 
told me. So, why do I refuse to listen? Why do I leave myself 
a reminder of an ex every time I look at my wrist, search my 
closet for a shirt to wear or walk into my bedroom? And while 
I’ve made the walk of shame to the same college boy’s house in 
the afterglow of a breakup with a Trader Joe’s bag filled with 
his T-shirts drenched, sneakily, in my perfume, the things I 
don’t return I can’t seem to let go of. In recent days, I’ve decided 
I’d like to know why I want to hold on. 

U

-M psychology professor Stephanie D. Preston 
has done extensive research regarding hoarding 
and emotional attachment to objects and said in 
an interview with The Michigan Daily, “research shows that 
emotional memory is a reason many people have a lot of trouble 
discarding things.” Specifically, when it comes to ex significant 
others, she told me many people “imagine that part of the other 
person is embodied in the item, therefore, throwing it away 
would be some kind of violating to that person.” 
We spoke for a few moments about hoarding disorder, the 
clinical diagnosis for severe cases of hoarding. I kept thinking 
about the TLC TV show “Hoarding: Buried Alive” and how 
so many watch the show to be entertained by individuals 
suffering from an intense mental illness. I’d be lying if I wasn’t 
entertained by the show myself at one point or another. The bit 
of information she shared that really pushed me to think more 
about my own situation was when she said, “anxiety is greatly 
correlated to hoarding of items in that it can exacerbate the 
issue.” 
She went on to explain that if one suffers from anxiety, they 
could potentially worry that by discarding something, they’ve 
made a terrible mistake. And as someone who’s been diagnosed 
with generalized anxiety disorder since age seven, I wondered 
if my attachment to my items stemmed from my fear that I’d 
be making a mistake by getting rid of them. Perhaps, I’d regret 
it temporarily, but in the long-run, I know in my head it isn’t 
a mistake to throw away last year’s shriveled up Valentine’s 
roses. My heart isn’t quick to catch up with the common sense 
I know in my head. In fact, if the physical manifestation of 
relationships gone awry weren’t around and those people not 
as easy to recall, I’d probably forget about them all together. 
So, what is it? Why do I feel the need to keep these things? 
Is it my sentimentality or the strange feeling of a lover turned 
stranger? Or my desire to keep a physical scrapbook of gifted 
shot glasses and oversized sweatshirts? Why is it that when I’ve 
moved on and happy with someone new, or alone (turn up the 
Lizzo), do I still have old stuff taking up broken heart-shaped 
holes in my life? I never wear any of their clothes, or use any of 
the items — I’d be lying if I didn’t take shots out of the Texas shot 
glass though — and barely think of the people they belong to. I 
just like to know that it’s all still around. That the parts of me 
that have grown up and grown past these experiences still exist 
somewhere, even if it’s in the thread of a Maize Rage T-shirt. 
That if I’m fighting to move forward, I still know what’s behind. 
Last year, I struggled through a very hard breakup with 
someone I loved very much. I’d returned a few of his favorite 
shirts in the immediate aftermath last February, but he 
mentioned he didn’t want the vast majority of what I had of his 
back, save the yellow Bubba Gump T-shirt of course. 
So here I am –– a pair of well-worn navy sweatpants, a 
professional Greek life T-shirt of an organization to which I 
no longer have a connection, a gifted bathrobe I adore, a pair 
of boxers with a strange pattern I’d had for a year and a half, 
and a few T-shirts with slogans that recalled moments which 
were only ours. I also had a picture frame, an autumnal looking 
bandana, a shoebox of handwritten notes and an apron from 
Anthropolgie. All of these things are spread out on my small 
floor as I pack up my apartment in Ann Arbor, before going 
to New York for the summer. Emotion stung at my face, and 
though we’d been through since February, we were still talking, 
and I knew I could ask him what he’d done with the sweaters 
and coffee shop T-shirts and belts and homemade poems I’d 
given to him during our relationship. I didn’t.

 I had three options: 
1. 
Throw it all out 
2. 
Refuse his month-old declaration that he wants 
nothing back and drop it all off without warning 
3. 
Pack it in a box and deal with it in September
I went with option three. I knew I should’ve gone with option 
one — saving the bathrobe and apron though, because, c’mon — 
but I also knew that I was and am a keeper of objects that hold 
meaning and metaphor and someone’s scent. Into the boxes 
they went. I forgot about them quickly after the plane touched 
down in New Jersey days later. 
Four and a half months later, I arrived in Ann Arbor for my 
fourth year. The distance and time between myself and my 
beloved college town treated me well, and I was thrilled to be 
back. I never say the words “over someone” because, as human 
beings, we don’t get over anything –– we grow through times in 
our life with people and places we no longer know. The anxiety 
and melancholy of winter 2019 was far from me –– both literally 
and emotionally. I felt newly fulfilled, excited and basking in 
newness –– a new year, a new course load, new relationships, a 
new bedroom. My heart was sore but freshly mended. I felt as 
though the wave of our ending had swelled, crashed and settled 
like foamy bubbles on the shore upon which I stood, feeling OK. 
I’d grown through something and would always have more 
growing to do. 
I moved into Ann Arbor for the fourth, final time and 
unpacking commenced. Box by box, my floor cluttered with my 
winter boots and dusty decor and purple bedding and pillows 
shaped like sloths. Then suddenly, in the mess of it all — navy 
blue sweatpants, three T-shirts, and a photograph of herself 
with another person, both of whom she no longer really knew. I 
paused in a moment of nostalgia and pushed the items off to the 
side. I left them in the corner of my room and moved forward 
in my unpacking. Once I finished with all the boxes, I’d decide 
what to do with them. These things didn’t really have a place in 
my bedroom or my life anymore. When I finished, I revisited his 
pile of things and wondered if I’d ever become less sentimental. 
I stood, gazing at them, almost afraid to touch them. I thought 
about writing a poem, I thought about hiding them, I thought 
about burning them in my nonexistent fireplace, I thought 
about asking if he wanted them back. I did none of those things, 
except write the poem. 
A few days later, I ran into the owner of these items on 
campus. Neither of us said anything or exchanged any glances. 
We had no bad blood and no hard feelings, it was just someone 
I used to know, who used to know me. We acknowledged each 
other briefly, and kept walking. An odd feeling really, a best 
friend turned stranger –– a sentiment with an indescribable 
aftertaste. I walked home from class that late September 
morning, having passed him in the halls, knowing vaguely 
what I had to do. It’s one thing to be nostalgic, it’s one thing to 
be romantic, but it’s another entirely to be holding on to objects 
that only truly prohibited me from ever living in the now. 
I beelined for the corner of my room where everything of his 
was balled in the corner looking like a sad, wilted pile of another 
life. I scooped it all up and felt oddly at peace as I walked down 
the sidewalk, the tower of everything that used to be, safe in my 
arms. As I arrived at my destination, I knew I could turn back, 
that I didn’t have to go through with this monumental moment. 
But I didn’t need any of his stuff. I never needed anyone’s stuff 
–– emotionally or physically. I honestly have plenty of my own. 
Sometimes, we hold on so tight to something fighting to get 
away, that our knuckles turn white. 

This is what I thought as I stood adjacent to a dumpster on 
the side of the road. 
There was a group of men working at the dumpsters who 
watched me, standing there, alone, with an armful of borrowed 
objects, weighing my next move. They were waiting for me to do 
what we all knew I was going to do. I was thinking about going 
home when one of them called out “Do it girl! You got this!” and 
with his declaration, I throttled the items over the side of the 
dumpster and watched for a half-second as they sailed through 
the air and landed with a satisfying thud in the midst of half-
empty beer cans, discarded mattresses and cardboard. For a 
moment, it felt like nothing else was happening in the rest of 
the world, like everything had stopped. And then, the group of 
men across the gravel parking lot began to cheer. Like actually, 
cheer. It’s as though they knew. I turned, now, empty handed, 
and walked the same exact way I came, only this time, I felt 
lighter. 
I

n the Greek myth of Orepheus and Eurydice, Orepheus 
is told he can lead Eurydice safely out of the underworld, 
so long as he doesn’t look back to make sure she’s 
behind him. If Orepheus looks back, Eurydice is stuck in the 
underworld forever. In the end, Orepheus looks back and could 
never move on from it. Like him, looking behind me in life, is 
what’ll keep me rooted there, full of regret and nostalgia and 
sentimentality and not moving fiercely forward. 
If it’s a good memory I’ll remember it. If it mattered, I’ll 
remember it. A pair of oversized sweatpants and an ugly 
turquoise T-shirt won’t be what I’ll remember. I’ll remember a 
bike ride to cupcakes in July and the firepit in the backyard of 
their childhood home. I’ll remember their laugh until I forget 
it. I’ll remember the way they fiddled with their glasses. I’ll 
remember the first date and then, one day, I’ll only remember 
the last one. I’ll remember senior prom. Maybe one day, I’ll 
recover a photograph of the two of us at a dance in college and 

think, “Remember them?” I will.
And it won’t be sad or painful or lonely. It’ll be the sweetest 
things. The objects I couldn’t get rid of weren’t what sparked joy 
–– the memories that were hanging off their threads did. What 
I end up remembering of these people, if anything, in ten years 
down the line, will have nothing to do with their old sweatshirt. 
Marie Kondo, through her platform, urges us to separate from 
unnecessary objects of our lives, not from our memories. 
I must part ways with the things of my past, which formerly 
hung to my belt loops and shoelaces. I honor what happened 
and will continue to do the work to make space in my closet and 
my mind for new stories. One day, there will be someone who’s 
stuff will be my stuff too. It will all spark joy. And now, I remain, 
open and cavernous, but not hollow. Ready for the kindling and 
the flicker of a new fire.

M

y grandfather was born on June 6, 1927. He 
was in the Navy during World War II and he 
served on a submarine and was stranded for 
weeks with only coconuts for sustenance. We celebrated 
his 92nd birthday early this summer, and he remarked, for 
the second year in a row, how much this celebration meant 
to him and how he couldn’t wait to eat lemon cake again 
with us the next time around. He wanted to live to 100 and 
well past that. 
I am lucky to have lived close to my family while grow-
ing up. We scattered ourselves around a little lake in south-
ern Michigan, where my dad was raised. My little sister 
and I would run around the neighborhood during the sum-
mer playing spy games, building forts, collecting plants and 
rocks. We would ding-dong ditch neighbors and run into 
the woods, make trails along the lakefront and commit our 
fair share of trespassing over soggy lawns and piers. 
My grandparents had a beautiful garden with wild 
raspberries and strawberries that we would sneakily har-
vest and bring home. The past few summers, we spent 
hours picking wild blackberries from their prickly bushes, 
avoiding mosquitoes and spider webs before stopping by 
our grandfather’s house to share. My grandmother used 
to layer up in the heat of July with socks pulled over long 
jeans and sweatshirts tucked into waistbands to evade 
thorns and biting mites, but more importantly, to reach the 
back of the berry bushes and avoid letting a single berry go 
to waste. Their garden—now overgrown with grasses and 
dandelions—no longer produces the delicate fruit it once 
did. 

As summers passed and high school drew to a close, 
family members were increasingly curious as to where I 
planned to continue my education. Not many people in 
my family, aside from my older cousins, attended college, 
and their expectations for me were high. I had college 
applications over halfway done for all sorts of out-of-state 
schools in October and I planned on having an additional 
two weeks to complete them with proper edits and teacher 
revisions. 
I received a concussion that day and was diagnosed with 
Post Concussive Syndrome after a month or two of symp-
toms not letting up. I was recommended for medical leave 
and was placed under a Section 504 plan which allowed me 
to be a part-time high school student and miss a significant 
number of school days. This arrangement allowed me to 
still graduate with my class.
My grandfather wanted to check in and see how I was 
doing. We connected quickly over our shared head knocks; 
he had fallen his fair share of times with old age. We dis-
cussed mutual symptoms and how these injuries made 
us feel different, even if we didn’t look different. We talk-
ed about how I didn’t know if I would get into any of the 
schools I applied to because I wasn’t able to finish my col-
lege applications. He promised me I would be fine, and I 
ended up only submitting to in-state schools. 
Once I got into Michigan, it was hard for me to talk to 
him as his hearing had started to decline. His stubborn-
ness demanded I shout to convey a message. So, I reverted 
to writing him letters and sitting with him while he read 
them and smiled back up at me. I wrote to him about my 

new research position, my volunteering at the hospital, the 
classes I was taking and how much I loved it here at Michi-
gan. He was so enthused when he found out I wanted to be 
a doctor — it’d be the first in our family and he immediately 
began calling me Dr. Bowman when I visited. He liked the 
ring of it and how much responsibility it carried. I could 
never express enough how his his nearly one hundred years 
of hard work granted me the opportunity to be in the posi-
tion I am and be a student at the University of Michigan.
Between bonding over mutual head traumas, intently 
listening to classic American stories from decades prior or 
shouting “I love you” from three feet away because he was 
too stubborn to use his hearing aids, my grandfather made 
everything possible and achievable for my family. Especial-
ly as a first-generation college student, the feat of attend-
ing a prestigious school is rarely possible without the hard 
work and sacrifice of respected family members that work 
to instill in you a drive for integrity and success. 
I recently got accepted for a position at The Michigan 
Daily as a columnist and he was so thrilled to read the Uni-
versity’s newspaper and see our last name printed in it. For 
fall break, I brought home four copies of each paper I was 
in so far this school year to show him. But on the morning 
of Oct. 14, my grandfather passed, and I wasn’t able to show 
him in person. This date was once so important for me as it 
marked a change in my life post-concussion. Now it signi-
fies another major change and life without my grandfather. 
This date now holds intrinsic importance and sadness for 
me in so many interwoven and complex ways, and I know I 
will be unraveling it for a long time.

uring 
my 
second 
month 
in Berlin, one of my good 
friends from Ann Arbor who 
also happened to be studying abroad 
visited me for a week. Kieran has 
always had a strong adventurous spir-
it, and our friendship developed from 
our ease of conversation and search 
for stories to tell. He had heard from 
one of his German friends that the 
cafe “Zuckerbaby”, loosely translated 
as sugar baby, was the place to go, so 
we went on his last day in Berlin. We 
walked in the rain from my apartment 
to the cafe laughing at the week we 
had just shared and wondering what 
our lives would look like once we were 
back in Ann Arbor. We made it to Zuck-
erbaby, rather drenched, ready for a 
warm meal. As we sat at a small table 
with mismatched chairs, the rain still 
hitting the rattling window. We said 
our goodbyes over grilled cheese sand-
wiches that felt like home. 
Even with Kieran gone, I made Zuck-
erbaby one of my go-to spots in Berlin. 
I think I would go because they made 
grilled cheese sandwiches with cheese 
oozing from the sides and frankly the 
best vegan carrot cake. I understand 
that having carrot cake as a favorite is 
rather odd. People will often critique 

carrot cake because it has raisins. I 
don’t understand this hatred of raisins. 
To me, the case in favor of carrot cake 
is simple — it is moist and sweet, but 
not overpowering. And honestly, who 
can say no to a buttery cream cheese 
frosting? But beyond the carrot cake, 
my love for Zuckerbaby is grounded 
in its ambience and charm, which 
reminded me of my favorite cafe in 
Fayetteville, Ark — a little cafe called 
Arsaga’s located right next to the rail-
road. Something about the old building 
housing Zuckerbaby — with exposed 
brick, old furniture and mood lighting 
— brought me back home to Fayette-
ville while studying abroad in the cold 
Berlin. 
One of my closests friends in Germa-
ny was Tabea, and I made sure to take 
her to Zuckerbaby. We met on a rainy 
Saturday afternoon and sat down at a 
charming wooden table. At the other 
end was a family — a set of parents, 
their newborn, and what I imagined 
were two overjoyed grandparents. 
Tabea and I spent a couple hours just 
talking and watching the day go by. 
Customers would come in and leave. 
The day was at peace. 
Right behind Tabea, still within my 
eyesight, an older couple sat down. As 

I listened to Tabea talk, I couldn’t help 
but observe them. They reminded me 
of my parents. I wondered if my par-
ents would get to live into their older 
years like the couple before me, and 
if they would spend their Saturday 
afternoons in cafes together just as 
they once had when they were teen-
agers. I lost track of the couple for a 
while. However, when I refocused my 
attention to their general direction, I 
noticed that the man had taken a leash 
out of his bag. In my mind, I imagined 
two stories. 
The first, that the couple had just 
put down a furry companion, and they 
were now at Zuckerbaby to avoid going 
back to the home that once housed 
their dear pet.
The other story was also about a dog. 
Perhaps they had decided to adopt a 
dog.
Neither of these proved to be cor-
rect. 
I remember watching intently, as 
the man eagerly attached the leash to 
the choker on the woman’s neck. I was 
taken aback by this, to me, brazen act. 
However I noticed that every so often, 
he would tug the leash and her head 
would lunge in the direction of his 
crotch. He did this once or twice mak-

ing eye-contact with me — a held gaze 
that I broke each time. 
I remember my brain was trying to 
process a lot at once as this interac-
tion was unfolding before me. The first 
thought that came to my mind: only in 
Berlin. I had a morbid curiosity to keep 
watching, but I also heard my mom’s 
voice in the back of my head reminding 
me that it is rude to stare. But I mostly 
got caught up in the scene happen-
ing all around me: a tranquil Saturday 
with a friend, the noises of a cooing 
baby behind me juxtaposed with the 
image of an older but seemingly kinky 
couple.
I wondered for a while what it is that 
I found so jarring as I sat and watched 
that couple in Zuckerbaby. Was I taken 
aback by the very exposed nature of 
the behavior? What does that say about 
my own assumptions of sex? I also con-
sidered if I was taken aback because 
the couple was older and dressed in 
posh clothes. Not the type of image I 
associate with kinky behaviour. 
I recognize that conversations sur-
rounding sexuality are getting easier 
to have, but still not the norm. We 
don’t always like to openly talk about 
how we are sexual beings. We don’t 
like to talk about fetishes. We hardly 
talk about how women are also sexual. 
And we certainly don’t talk about how 
older people are still doing it. But why? 
Why do we associate sex with youth? 
Is our understanding of sex so 
closely tied to our sight that we can’t 
think of an older body being attractive. 
There seems nothing inherent about 
sex or even love that would be exclu-
sive to younger generations. Sure, the 
body changes, but does that funda-
mentally mean that sex and old age 
are diametrically opposed? How do we 
overcome our assumptions? I wonder 
are they living a more honest sexuality 
than I am — unashamed? 
I don’t have the answers to any of 
these questions, but what the overt 
scene lay bare were my own hasty 
assumptions and judgments about sex. 
This couple, inadvertently, planted a 
seed in my mind that has grown into 
several questions. 
As I observed the couple, I tried to 
overcome my initial prejudice, and 
tried to see them for what they were in 
that moment: strangers, with an equal 
right to express and explore their sex-
uality. 
I thought, only in Berlin.
