Resolution against Snyder

College of
Engineering ranks
ninth, nuclear

By SUZANNE JACOBS
Daily StaffReporter
Many college seniors across
the country are anxiously
waiting to hear from gradu-
ate schools, and based on U.S.
Newu & World Report's newly
released annual rankings of the
country's top graduate schools,
the University may be high on
many of their lists.
U.S. News & World Report
ranked five main professional
programs - medicine, law, busi-
ness, education and engineer-
ing - in its 2012 compilation of
graduate schools, in addition
to classifying subspecialties
of more than 1,200 graduate
schools.
In a seventh-place tie with
the University of Pennsylvania,
the University of Michigan Law
School ranked the highest of all
the University's professional
schools, rising two spots from

last year.
The average LSAT score of
University Law students is 168-
171, and the students' average
undergraduate grade point aver-
age is 3.57-3.85, according to the
report.
Until this year, the same law
schools have held the top 14
spots since U.S. News & World
Report began ranking law pro-

Assembly debates
stance on governor
as grad. speaker
By ROBIN VEECK
DailyStaffReporter
Ina rare closevotethe Michi-
gan Student Assembly narrowly
struck down a resolution that
would have opposed the Univer-

sity's choice to invite Republican
Gov. Rick Snyder to speak at this
year's Spring Commencement.
The resolution proposed that
MSA send a letter to University
administrators and several news
outlets, including The Michi-
gan Daily, expressing that the
assembly felt Snyder wasn't "an
appropriate" choice for com-
mencement speaker due to his
"lack of commitment for acces-
sible and quality education." The

resolution failed to pass by a vote
of 14-9.
Snyder has proposed a 15-per-
cent decrease in state funding of
Michigan's public universities
and colleges for the 2012 fiscal
year. Because of this, many stu-
dents have reacted unfavorably
to the University asking Snyder
to deliver the commencement
address. An online petition
opposing the choice of Snyder as
commencement speaker had col-

lected nearly 4,000 signatures
from students, alumni, faculty
and staff as of 1:30 a.m. last night.
LSA Rep. Brendan Friedman,
co-author of the resolution, said
at last night's MSA meeting that
the petition indicates that the
resolution represents the inter-
ests of MSA's constituents.
"We believe that the com-
mencement speaker should be
someone that represents the val-

Funds for UHS, Planned
Parenthood threatened


House bill would
cut aid to Title X
Family Planning
By DAVID BUCCILLI
Daily StaffReporter
Students who seek health
services from University Health
Service or Planned Parenthood
may have more limited options
if a bill in Congress proposing
to cut funding to health clinics
becomes law.

The U.S. Senate is currently
debating a bill, which passed the
U.S. House of Representatives
last month, that would reduce
funding to the federal Title X
Family Planning program. Title
X provides preventative health
services to about 5 million peo-
ple at more than 4,500 clinics,
including Planned Parenthood,
in primarily low-income com-
munities. Other clinics that
would likely be impacted by
the drop in funding are college
health centers at like UHS.
Desiree Cooper, a spokes-

woman for Planned Parenthood
of Mid and South Michigan
wrote inane-mailinterviewthat
the bill would cut funds from all
Planned Parenthood preventive
health care programs "includ-
ing cancer screenings, birth
control, HIV testing, and testing
and treatment for other sexually
transmitted infections."
"Nationally, we are facing
the most aggressive legislative
attack on women's health care
seen in years," Cooper wrote.

U.S. House voted to
reduce $445M in
two-year period
By HALEY GLATTHORN
Daily StaffReporter
For drivers who enjoy listen-
ing to news radio stations on
their way to work, the state of
the national budget may cause a

disruption to their morning com-
mutes.
Though the U.S. Senate has
yet to approve a federal budget
for the next fiscal year, the U.S.
House of Representatives recent-
ly voted to eliminate all federal
funding for public broadcasting,
constituting a drop of about $445
million by 2013.
While the loss may not be sub-
stantial for broadcasting giants
such as the Public Broadcast-

ing Service and National Public
Radio, local broadcasting stations
across the country would feel sig-
nificant financial effects.
According to NPR's website,
the company gains 34 percent of
its revenue through membership
fees that stations like Michigan

ed branch of NPR that serves Ann

Frank Buckles was buried
yesterday with the pomp and
ceremony befitting the man
who outlived 4.7 million other
Americans who served in World
War I.
His flag-draped casket was
carried to his gravesite at Arling-

caisson led by seven horses. A
seven-man firing party fired
three rifle volleys and a bugler
played "Taps" as hundreds of
onlookers saluted or held their
hands to their hearts.
At the end of the grave-

Army's vaunted "Old Guard"
folded the flag as an Army band
played "America the Beautiful."
Army Vice Chief of Staff Gen.
Peter Chiarelli presented it to
Buckles' daughter, Susannah
Flanagan.
"To our comrade in arms,
Frank Woodruff Buckles, our
nation bestows military honors,"
said Lt. Col. Keith N. Croom, an

in the rankings. The medical
school rankings were divided
into two categories - research
and primary care. The Uni-

dropped from 6th to loth place
while its primary care rating
fell from 14th to 20th from last

With an 8.5 percent accep-

Three different schools
took the top spots in each of
the two medical school cat-
egories. Harvard University,
the University of Pennsylvania
and Johns Hopkins Univer-
sity ranked in the top three for
research, and the University of
Washington, the University of
North Carolina-Chapel Hill
and Oregon Health and Sci-
ence University took the lead
in primary care.
The Ross School of Business

took the top spot, surpassing
Harvard University, which
shared first place with Stan-
ford last year.

The University of Michigan
College of Engineering ranked
ninth on the list for engineer-
ing programs, with the sub-
specialty nuclear engineering
taking first place.
The University of Michi-
gan also earned a first place
spot for the School of Public
Health's Department of Health
Management and Policy.
However, the University tra-
ditionally chooses not to place
much emphasis on national
rankings.
"While University officials
are pleased that U-M consis-

nation's finest universities by
U.S. News & World Report,
they also note that this type of
strict ranking of schools is not
the most accurate measure of

Friedman said. should condemn," Wagner said.
MSA representatives who Nate Hamilton, an MSA ex-offi-
opposed the resolution said it cio for the University's chapter of
would be inappropriate to reject a College Republicans, echoed Wag-
commencement speaker based on ner's objections to the resolution.

"UHS will lose money if this
bill becomes law," Caldwell said,
noting that university health cen-
ters are among many community-
based health clinics that receive
funding from Title X.
"It's playing politics with wom-
en's lives," Caldwell added. "It's
funding programs for women
who have no other options for
health care who can't go any-
where else."
Proponents of the reduction
to Title X say the government
shouldn't be funding or support-
ing abortion - one of the preven-
tive health practices offered by
Planned Parenthood. However,
while Title X finances much of
Planned Parenthood, it also pro-
hibits using federal funding for
abortions.
"You see Republicans talking
on the news on how it's going to
end abortions, but that's not what
it's about," Caldwell said.
LSA junior Charles Bogren,
chair of the University's chapter
of College Republicans, did not
respond to an e-mail inquiry from
The Michigan Daily last night.
The Senate has until Friday to
pass the bill or pass a resolution to
extend the deadline until April 8.
"This resolution is politically
driven and intolerant, plain and
simple," Hamilton said at the
meeting.
MSA speakers against the reso-
lution also expressed concerns
that the suggested letter from the
assembly would alienate Snyder's
office and other Republicans in
the state Legislature and would
discourage future visits from
political leaders.
Snyder's policies weren't the
only turnoffs for some MSA mem-
bers. Social Work Rep. Allison
Horky, another co-author of the
resolution, expressed doubt about
Snyder's oratory skills.
"I think he's actually a bad
speaker, which is actually just as
legitimate a reason to not want
to listen to him for 30 minutes,"
Horky said at the meeting.

the State Theater.
In addition to offering a
variety of Mediterranean
foods, La Marsa will have spe-
cialty dishes, like the Egyp-
tian entree koshary - a dish
Gannouni described as a mix
of rice, pasta, tomato paste,
spices, lentils and fried onions.
The restaurant will also serve
a special bread pudding called
omo ali, which contains French
bread, honey, rosewater and
mixed nuts.
"There is so much fast food
in Ann Arbor," Gannouni said.
"I want to serve (students)
fresh, quality and quantity."
Ed Davidson, who owns
the building occupied by La
Marsa, and is also the owner of
Bivouac on South State Street,
expressed his excitement that
a Michigan resident's business
is moving into the space.
"I wanted fresh food, and
the food is excellent," David-
son said, adding that he's eaten
at one the other La Marsa loca-
tions.
Cos closed its location since
it had problems paying rent,
Davidson said, adding that he
has high hopes for La Marsa.
"(State Street) has become
quite an entertainment district
in Ann Arbor," Davidson said.
"People are expecting a little
more than fast food, and now
they'll have it."
Gannouni said he hopes the
opening coincides with the
Ann Arbor Art Fair.
Workers at two Mediterra-

nean restaurants already near
campus have differing opin-
ions on the impact La Marsa's
opening will have on their
businesses.
Ali Ramlawi, owner of Jeru-
salem Garden on South Fifth
Avenue, said he doesn't think
La Marsa will affect his res-
taurant.
"I'm sure we (will) share
the same clientele sometimes,
but I don't think it'll have any
impact," Ramlawi said. "We're
a niche with a pretty strong
following."
But Christine McGinn, an
employee at Pita Kabob Grill
on East William Street, said
the addition of another Medi-
terranean restaurant will like-
ly have a negative effect on the
establishment.
"I assume having another
Mediterranean restaurant a
block away will split business,"
McGinn said.
Tom Heywood, director of
the State Street Association,
expressed optimism about La
Marsa's potential in the city.
"The more restaurants in
some ways, the better off (we
are) because there are more
choices," Heywood said. " ...
We look at them all as part of
the family."
Gannouni said he is happy to
be joining State Street and that
he is eager to contribute to the
diversity of cultures in the city.
"I want to add something
to Ann Arbor," Gannouni said.
"Ann Arbor is an international
place."

gramming. NPR does not receive
any direct federal funding, though
about 2 percent of the compa-
ny's revenue comes from grants
awarded by federal agencies.
If the bill is passed, Michi-
gan Radio stands to lose up to
$425,000 of federal funding - a
figure that represents 8 percent of
the station's yearly budget.
"($445 million) per year is a
relatively small number in the
scope of the federal budget," Steve
Chrypinski, Michigan Radio's
marketing director, said. "(But)
for some stations that would be
a really (harmful) cut. Federal
money can be up to 40 percent of
(a station's) budget."
Severely affected stations like
WNMU, which broadcasts in
Michigan's Upper Peninsula and
northeast Wisconsin, will experi-
ence the greatestfinancial distress
in the event of a funding cut. Eric
Smith, WNMU's general man-
ager, told The Los Angeles Times
in a March 11 article that the loss
of funding "would be devastating"
for the station.

Other stations in similar finan-
cial positions would be forced
to lay off many staff members as
well as decrease programming,
Chrypinski said. He added that
Michigan Radio would consider
these options to make up for lost
revenue, and the station may
increase fundraising.
"We haven't made any specific
contingency plans saying we're
going to eliminate this program or
make changes in staff," Chrypin-
ski said. "(That is) partly because
we don't know how it's going to
shake out - will that money be cut
by a percentage (or) will it go away
entirely?"
While MichiganRadio ispartof
an industry that has been shrink-
ing in recent years, Chrypinski
said the company has increased
reporters to "fill the gap" between
demands for news radio and the
dwindling supply of companies
still broadcasting.
"Aside from what NPR does
(by) providing national and inter-
national news, we do dozens of
local feature stories coveringnews
going on in Michigan," Chrypin-
ski said. "Public broadcasting is
really fillinga need that I think is
there."

Same (sex) benefits
Health care disparities exist for 'U' couples
The University has long been seen as a bastion of tolerance,
progressive thinking and action. But because of complica-
tions arising from a seven-year-old state amendment, it
has had some serious issues to address concerning the treatment of
homosexual couples with respect to health care benefits.

ERIKN
TORENBERG

The discrepancy in health benefits was
brought up in a recent study conducted by
University alum Gilia Smith, who gave a pre-
sentation last week to the Senate Advisory
Committee on University Affairs - the lead
faculty governing body - on the inequality
regarding benefits given to same-sex couples
compared to those given to married couples.
According to Smith, the primary issue with
the University's policy is that an employee in
a non-married relationship, whether same-
sex or heterosexual, must live with his or
her partner for at least six months before the
partner is eligible for health benefits. Smith
asserts this policy would not be acceptable
if it were associated with any other demo-
graphic like race.
With this policy, the University aims to
circumvent restrictions on same-sex couples'
health benefits that were established in a bal-
lot initiative that banned gay marriage and
was approved by Michigan voters in 2004. In
the case of married couples at the University,
partners automatically receive benefits, since
their marital status mandates their legal and
financial dependence. The University's policy
serves as a loophole for same-sex couples by
using six months of coexistence as a means
of recognizing dependency between part-
ners and a need for shared health care ben-
efits. While the University's policy has good
intent, it still forces co-dependent same-sex
couples to wait six months to establish their
need for benefits, while a heterosexual cou-
ple receives their benefits immediately upon
marriage.
There's probably a better way to achieve

the goal of equitable benefits for deserving
couples - perhaps proof of co-dependency
instead of residency would be more effective.
University action to prevent the resulting
inequality might include a closer investiga-
tion of how people are associated with each
other. Though this solution is not ideal - and
indeed potentially invasive and costly - the
initiative would be better than the current
stopgap measure that makes same-sex cou-
ples wait for significant benefits that they
should be entitled to.
It's important to note the underlying issue
is with the proposal itself, not misconduct
by the University. The draconian ballot ini-
tiative that amended the state constitution
to define marriage as between a man and a
woman - and banned civil unions - has
left the University's hands tied. It has been
forced to rely on a loophole in order for same-
sex couples to be provided with benefits.
This needs to be reversed and is as much of
a priority as the ailing economy. Under our
Constitution, basic civil rights need to be
guaranteed for all citizens, including same-
sex couples.
By virtue of the 2004 ballot initiative Pro-
posal 2, Michigan voters made it very dif-
ficult for the University to protect rights of
the LGBTQ community. But difficult doesn't
mean impossible. Regardless of any hurdles
it may face, the University should make an
even greater effort to combat the inequal-
ity exposed by Smith. Michigan voters should
take note of the University's efforts and take
action to reverse the deleterious effects of the
constitutionally embedded gay marriage ban.

organization MPowered: "If you're
serious about what you wrote, come
meet us at 3 p.m. tomorrow."
It became apparent that MPow-
ered's vision aligns with every-
thing I celebrated in that column. I
assumed that their main focus was
on birthing high-growth businesses.
I had no idea that they promote the
mindset that makes them and other
high-impact endeavors possible. I
kept interrupting the conversation
- "Guys, you're sure you believe that
community organizers, activists
and non-profits can also be entre-
preneurial, right?" And they would
respond: "As long as they do some-
thing about it - as long as they don't
simply talk about it - then yes."
Then they told me about eRes,
their new living-learning commu-
nity in Mojo, which aims to instill
the entrepreneurial mindset in stu-
dents. They work on actual, real
problems that they define based on
their interests. Students come from
diverse disciplines, so engineers
will work with philosophy majors,
Business students with English
majors, and so on. The program
doesn't verbally "teach" them the
entrepreneurial mindset. Rather, it
provides a unique environment for
students to develop and practice it
through hands-on experience fol-
lowed by reflection.
Most students may not know that
they themselves are entrepreneur-
ial or even that they want to be. We
want to change that. While discuss-
ing this, we quickly realized that it
would have been highly hypocriti-

cal for us to merely sit and chat. The
seed was planted for 1000 Voices: A
grassroots, student-led initiative to
encourage entrepreneurial educa-
tion at the University.
National figures from University
PresidentMarySue Colemanto Pres-
ident Barack Obama have endorsed
entrepreneurial education. The stars
are aligned.o1000 Voices isn't merely
a petition. It's a movement.
Phase one: Gain supportfor entre-
preneurial communities, like eRes.
Give access and incentives for LSA
students to take classes that provide
vital project management experi-
ence - classes that allow them to
apply what they learn in a real world
context. The Center for Entrepre-
neurship incentivizes Engineer-
ing students to take these types of
classes. LSA should do the same.
While the first phase targets LSA,
its underlying concept affects all
students. Phases two, three and four
of entrepreneurial education will be
shaped by the dialogue created from
this initial phase.
Some say the entrepreneurial
mindset is inborn, that it can't be
taught. They're wrong.
If that were true, MPowered
wouldn't exist. If that were true,
universities across the world
wouldn't be establishing entre-
preneurial hubs. If that were true,
more than 3,000 students wouldn't
have submitted pitches last year to
the 1000 Pitches campaign. Clearly,
culture and environment affect how
entrepreneurial students become.
Clearly, the entrepreneurial mind-
set can be developed. Note: It
should be practiced through direct
experience, not from a textbook or
from a chalkboard. It thrives in an
environment that provides oppor-
tunities and incentives to undergo
direct experience. 1000 Voices will
show our immense desire for such
an environment.
Students, here is how you can help.
Sign the petition at lkv.org. But don't
stopthere. Reflect onyoureducation-
al experience. Ask yourself: What
type of opportunities would you like
to see? What does entrepreneurial
education look like to you? Faculty,

alumni and anyone interested need
to participate in the discussion.
To me, entrepreneurial educa-
tion aspires to develop innovative
self-starters with strong character.
Students will analyze books, man-
age projects and engage in pro-
ductive social activities. This way,
students will learn how to approach
problems differently, execute their
solutions and build strong, sustain-
able relationships.
Credentials
aren't as valuable
as skill sets.
It's a widely held notion that our
education model is outdated. In
our parents' generation, a degree
guaranteed a job. Not anymore. We
live in an age of personal branding,
where credentials - what school
you attended and what you majored
in - is less important than the
value of your skills and your ability
to work in groups.
I quote Coleman: "The mission of
the University ... (is to develop) lead-
ers and citizens who will challenge
the present and enrich the future."
And I quote our 1000 Voices cam-
paign: "We call for an environment
conducive to developing the entre-
preneurial mindset, where students
actively acquire their education
instead of passively receive it."
At the very least,o1000 Voices will
respond to accusations of apathy.
Bob Herbert, New York Times col-
umnist, lambasted college students
in a recent column, stating, "Perhaps
more now than ever, the point of the
college experience is to have a good
time and walk away with a valuable
credential after putting in the least
effort possible."
Well, Mr. Herbert, more than
1,000 people at the University are
about to say otherwise.

Give Snyer a chance

FOR: I regret signing the
petition against Snyder
TO THE DAILY:
On Monday I signedthe petition protesting
Republican Gov. Rick Snyder's participation
in the University's 2011 Spring Commence-
ment. I did so because I'm quite appalled by
his opening salvo of anti-education and pro-
business policies. However, upon further
thinking about the petition itself, I realize
today that I regret signing it.
A fundamental part of being a member of
a university community is encouraging dis-
AGAINST Attend today's
Snyder protest in the Diag
TO THE DAILY:
It saddens me to see University President
Mary Sue Coleman's announcement that
Republican Gov. Rick Snyder will deliver an
address at Spring Commencement, especially
given Snyder's recent policy initiatives that
jeopardize the University's future. The cut of
$100 million to the University's budget might
seem acceptable in a time of fiscal crisis, but
consider that the budget for the Michigan
Department of Corrections will now dwarf
the higher education budget - spending
$0.79 on education for every $1 spent on cor-
rections.
Further, Snyder wishes to eliminate per-
sonal tax deductions for those wishing to
donate to public universities; those making
more than $75,000 ($150,000 per couple)
would no longer be able to make deductions

course, listening respectfully to individuals
with whom we even vehemently disagree.
For me this is a non-negotiable bedrock prin-
ciple of American cultural and intellectual
life. The petition's desire to reject Snyder
- and, strangely, any sitting public official
from commencement speech consideration
- does us all a disservice. It suggests that
Michigan students shouldn't be trusted to
listen, process, accept and, indeed, dissent.
On the contrary, I feel these are, in fact, the
very abilities graduating American scholars
should gather to celebrate.
Nick Harp
Department ofEnglish lecturer
for supporting their alma mater.
Inviting Snyder to deliver the commence-
ment address tacitly endorses his gutting of
the University's budget and his threats to
University donations, all while bestowing
upon him an honorary degree. Irrespective
of students' wishes, the University will con-
vey to our governor that we support his plan,
one that threatens the very fabric of our Uni-
versity and discourages successful alumni
from donating.
Hope isn't lost, though. Students opposed
to Snyder's budget "fix" should pressure
the University's Board of Regents to reject
Snyder's invitation to speak at Spring Com-
mencement. We shouldn't honor someone
whose proposal decreases access to educa-
tion while privileging incarceration. Rather,
we should send a message of concern to the
governor, noting that we're discouraged by
his plans that threaten Michigan's future.
Zachary Goldsmith
LSA Senior

It was announced on Monday that Republic Gov.
Rick Snyder will be delivering the Spring Commence-
ment speech at the 2011 graduation ceremony on
April 30. Immediately following this announcement,
students began to organize protests in an attempt to
sway the University's Board of Regents to vote to not
approve Snyder.
Yesterday, I woke to an e-mail from LSA senior
Zach Goldsmith asking me to join the Facebook group
"PROTEST against Rick Snyder as Commencement
Speaker!"
Let me start by saying it's absolutely every student's
right to protest. That being said, I strongly believe that
students need to give our new governor a chance.
Nothing has worked in Michigan for more than the
past 10 years, and Snyder undoubtedly has a very dif-
ficult job. He has kept a low profile nationally (unlike
other state governors) and has assured unions that he's
not against them and supports collective bargaining
rights. He's not your typical politician and isn't scared
to make sacrifices.
I specifically like his plan to simplify the tax code for
individuals and get rid of the Michigan Business Tax.
The current tax code is too complicated and unfair with
the vast number of random deductions. Also, I strongly
agree with his proposal to reduce the tax burden on "S"
corporations and LLC's. Under the current tax code,
these companies are taxed twice - on personal income
and corporate profits. By cutting this tax, companies
will be better equipped to invest in new technologies
and projects, which will stimulate the Michigan econ-
omy by bringing business to the state and creating jobs
that will keep recent graduates (like myself) in Michi-
gan. In addition, why should pension funds not be taxed?
Pensions are just another way to defer income. In order
for Snyder to remain transparent, consistent and fair
in his tax code, he must fight to tax pension income as

regular income.
I understand that many students are upset that Sny-
der was chosen to deliver the Spring Commencement
speech because of his proposal to cut funding for higher
education. This is a difficult decision because it's impor-
tant to maintain the strong reputation that schools like
the University of Michigan and Michigan State Uni-
versity have. However, the university communities are
comprised of very smart minds. I'm confident that they
will be able to be more efficient with the money they
have while maintaining their prestige and ability to
recruit top students and professors.
I like that Snyder is attempting to run the state like
a business. He's not worried about appeasing special
interests. He's trying to make the state more efficient
and collaborative. People read headlines that say "cor-
porate tax cuts" and "decrease state employee wages"
and immediately assume Snyder is just trying to make
the rich richer at the expense of the middle and lower
classes. People are obviously goingto be upset with bud-
get cuts and the increase in taxes, but Snyder is a smart
businessman with a proven track record.
Despite this, Snyder isn't going to use his opportu-
nity to address the student body to transcend a political
message; he has proven himself to be above that politi-
cal cattiness. He will speak to the outgoing class about
leadership, the importance of our generation and his
experience in attempting to turn around a state that
desperately needs help. Snyder has demonstrated excel-
lent leadership ability. He possesses three degrees from
the University, and prior to stepping into the governor's
chair, Snyder ran an extremely successful business
located in Ann Arbor. So whether you agree with his
political agenda or not, give him a chance and listen to
what he has to say.

Dodos redefine genre

British dance-punk
group royally rocks
second album
By ELLIOT ALPERN
DailyArts Writer
"The funky monkeys is com-
ing!" screams a sample on the
first single "The Monkeys Are
Coming" from Don't Say We
Didn't Warn You, and it doesn't
get any
more nor- 7k C 7C>
mal from
there. Does It Offend
Rang- You, Yeah?
ing from
house to Don't Say We
alternative Didn't Warn You
(sometimes CookingVinyl
even in the
same song),
the dance-punk outfit Does It
Offend You, Yeah? plays with
a fervency that feels like a caf-
feine-fueled freakout punctu-
ated by episodes of calmness.
Sometimes sweet, sometimes
intense and sometimes down-
right weird, Don't Say We Didn't
Warn You always finds ways to
surprise and entertain.
Without a doubt, Don't Say's
greatest attribute is its reck-
less and rewarding tracklist.
For instance, the wonderfully
excessive "John Hurt" goes big
with booming drums and heavy
riffs as singer James Rushent
screams "Get out of my fucking
way!" However, immediately
after, "Pull Out My Insides" is
almost tender in its vulnerabil-

it, and is more than accessible
enough to make noise on the
Top 40.
The variety doesn't stop
there: On "Wondering," British
rapper Trip overlays a vibrant
synthesizer with lines like "I
keep seeing Bill Hicks's ghost
/ he says World War IV will be
fought with sticks and stones."
The opening track "We Are
the Dead," begins with a soft,
charming indie guitar, but
morphs into a fist-pumping
house beat.
The British natives break
out to show their ability most
in the more alternative-orient-
ed tracks. While "Pull Out My
Insides" could be the best song
on the album, the concluding
"Broken Arms" is forlorn but
soothingly beautiful. It culmi-
nates the record with solemn
reflection. And while it might
clash with other tracks, it is
nonetheless powerfully emo-
tive.
Though the record boldly
touches upon an almost innu-
merable amount of genres, it
never feels like it's spread too
thin. Rushent's voice is distin-
guishable enough to tie togeth-
er the tracks that contain it,
while certain guitar and syn-
thesizer notes repeat through-
out the album, giving it a sense
of unity.
Admittedly, Don't Say does
bow slightly at its center -
probably because of its core of
house music - but it's at this
point where Does It Offend You,
Yeah? shows off its immense
creativity. Though the string

of songs isn't easy listening by
any means, it seems like mate-
rial typical of the clubs where
young Britons go for abun-
dant drugs and the late-night
strangeness that follows. For
instance, while it's not exactly
single-worthy, "The Monkeys
Are Coming" actually makes
a beat out of what would oth-
erwise sound like a Barrel of
Monkeys commercial, and hap-
pens to sample a popular Inter-
net meme in the process.
With its sophomore release,
Does It Offend You, Yeah?
proves that the popularity of
2008's You Have No Idea What
You're Getting YourselfInto was
entirely deserved. The band is
clearly on an upward trend -
their first U.S. headline tour
was completely sold-out - and
their newfound fame has accu-
mulated opportunities to tour
with the likes of Linkin Park
and The Prodigy, among oth-
ers. With their unique adept-
ness in a breadth of genres,
Does It Offend You, Yeah? has
many plausible paths from
here, all of which are bright
with potential.

ies that will never be solved.

There is
yet another
dilemma that has stumped
the masses, flourishing in
online interviews and music
magazines: What genre best

tar and percussion duo with
countless musical influences
and styles? It's a question that
has plagued our culture since
the dawn of time - or at least
since the band's first EP release
in 2005. Are they a folk group,
setting out to represent modest
America with their strings and
earthy vocals? A coffee shop-
dwelling indie band that prides
itself on its bassless, carefree
vibe? Do their rapid beats and
peppy lyrics even designate
them to the baroque pop realm?
With their downhome guitar
plucking, West African drum
patterns and lack of a bass play-
er, stamping a label on the band
is as enigmatic as Gwyneth Pal-
trow's singing career.
The release of No Color
makes classifying The Dodos
even more challenging: The
daring work puts a twist on
their already distinctive music,
infusing their well-known
thumping percussion and
frantic guitar lines with new
tones and instrumentation.

The Michigan Daily - michigandaily.com

Experienced Toth delivers late for Michigan

0

By ZACH HELFAND
Daily Sports Writer
Anthony Toth wasn't even
supposed to swing. He was sup-
posed to let the 2-2 pitch at his
shoulders fly by and let the count
go full.
Then again, he wasn't sup-
posed to play four years ago,
either. He was supposed to red-
shirt, let his first year go by and
prepare for the next season.
But for the redshirt senior sec-
ond baseman, things don't always
work out the way they're sup-
posed to. Like how a teammate's
injury thrust Toth into the lineup
his true freshman year.
Like how he had to redshirt
his second season, less than a
year after playing in the Super
Regionals.
Like how on Saturday, he
somehow connected with a pitch
he knew he couldn't handle for
a game-winning and potentially
season-changing double.
No. For Anthony Toth, things
don't always work out the way
they're supposed to. And that's
been a good thing.
With his hit Saturday in the
9-8 win against Winthrop, the
co-captain increased his team-

leading total of game-winning
hits to seven. And though Toth,
who said he can't even remem-
ber any of his game-winning hits,
cannot explain his success under
pressure, his past offers its own
explanation.
"It's been a very, very long
journey," he said. "I mean, this is
my fifth year. I've played a little
bit of college baseball."
Over those five years, Toth
experienced more than most col-
lege baseball players ever will.
The recruited walk-on stepped
onto campus in 2006 thinking
he'd redshirt his true freshman
year. In Fall ball, the undersized
Toth was having serious issues.
"Offensively, I was just pep-
peringballs into the visitor's dug-
out all daybecause I just couldn't
catch up to anything. My swing
was so bad," Toth said.
In the winter, Michigan coach
Rich Maloney and the coaching
staff prohibited Toth from hit-
ting a baseball. Instead, he did
dry swings with a monster bat -
a heavily weighted bat - for three
months trying to solve his swing
troubles. The three months, they
figured, would be worth it. After
all, he was redshirting that year
anyway.

But an injury to starting short-
stop Leif Mahler changed that.
Suddenly, Toth Was forced into
the mix as the utility infielder
off the bench. But the freshman
rolled with it. He made six starts
at second base, recorded 11 hits in
26 at bats and was a key defensive
player.
And, most importantly, he got
his first taste of a win-or-go-
home atmosphere when the Wol-
verines completed their series
victory over Vanderbilt in the
Regional Finals.
"The clinching game ... was the
most nervous I've ever been in
any sport at any point in my life,"
Toth said. "And I actually made
an error that game, and it was
to put the winning run on in the
bottom of the ninth. So, as you
can imagine, I was freaking out."
Luckily for Toth, the error
didn't cost Michigan the series.
The freshman had survived his
first pressure situation, and in
doing so, gained experience that
would prove invaluable in the
years to come.
When Mahler returned to
health in 2008, Toth was forced
to go from the field at the Super
Regionals to the bench for a red-
shirt season his sophomore year.

Toth waited and watched, but he
never stopped working.
"Anthony, for one, has worked
from the bottom up," Maloney
said. "Just on his own, the swing,
he had to reconstruct ... plus he
was weak, strength-wise. He's
worked his tail off to get stronger.
I don't know how many pounds,
you'll have to ask him, I bet you
he gained 25 to 30 pounds.
"It just says alot about who he
is as a character and how bad he
wanted to be a player for Michi-
gan."
As Toth began to develop phys-
ically, he began to develop into a
team leader as well. Strength-
ened by his experience and his
work ethic, he's now one of the
team's best situational hitters -
especially late-game situations.
After losing two close games
in the first half of the Bojangles
Baseball Classic last weekend,
the Wolverines managed to
claw their way back to an 8-8 tie
against Winthrop entering the
ninth inning.
That's when he saw the pitch.
"Coach and I talked about all
the time that a pitch that I can't
handle is anything above my
hands," he said. "It was a fastball
that was up at my shoulders that

0

Fifth-year senior second baseman Anthony Toth tallied his seventh career
game-winning hit last weekend.

I should've never been swinging
at."
He was never supposed to
swing at the pitch. And he cer-
tainly wasn't supposed to be able

to hit it. But for Toth, things don't
always work out the way they're
supposed to.
And on Saturday, that was def-
initely a good thing.

Strength coach Aaron Wellman Hoke begins practice

sets tone for Hoke before spring

By TIM ROHAN
Daily Sports Editor
Brady Hoke had a stern message
for anyone who underestimates
the impact of Aaron Wellman:
That'd be a mistake.
"I hope you don't," Hoke
warned. "I hope you don't."
Michigan's new director of
strength and conditioning has
been with Hoke for the past seven
years, including stops at Ball State
and San Diego State. And while
Hoke has to wait until Satur-
day when spring practice starts,
Wellman has already started the
process of transforming the Wol-
verines.
"He gets more time than any-
body to be with your players
because of the NCAA restric-
tions," Hoke said. "That guy has to
be your right hand, in my opinion.
There's not a night I don't talk to
him, wherever I am, to see how
the day went. Because he's with
the guys - he's with the kids.
"They've gotten better. (The
reports) weren't so nice early, but
they've gotten better."
Defensive coordinator Greg
Mattison described Wellman as
an "everything" guy - not just
strength or speed.
He's teaching Hoke's guys dis-
cipline and accountability before
the coaches get their hands on
them. On the first day of winter
conditioning, Wellman had the
players go through a simple run to
the line, as Mattison described it.
And Wellman made some players
repeat the drill five or six times.
That's the way Wellman oper-
ates: Do it right or go back and do
it again.
Before Mattison first met Well-
man, he had already heard sto-
ries elsewhere in the coaching
world about how good this young
strength and conditioning coach
was. So when the two of them
ended up in Ann Arbor, Mattison

decided to introduce himself dur-
ing one of Wellman's weight train-
ing sessions - that was a mistake.
Wellman ignored the defensive
coordinator, as if to say, get out of
here, I've got work to do.
"I'm not gonna mess with him
anymore," Mattison said.
Hoke said that to teach account-
ability, ifasingle player is late to an
early morning workoutor run, that
player's whole group is punished.
"That's how you build men-
tal toughness, and it starts with
him," Mattison said. "I've always
believed that in college, if you have
a great strength coach that has the
same mission as your head coach
and the same mission your team
wants to play with, you have a
great chance."
Hoke said he will be looking
for a few key things from his play-
ers this spring, including attitude,
toughness, effort and accountabil-
ity - all of which canbe learned in
the weight room or duringsprints.
"(Wellman) is incredibly good
at what he does," Hoke said. "Not
from just a strength and condi-
tioning (standpoint), but a mental

standpoint for your team.
"We've been able to have an
attitude (as) ateam that nobody is
going to beat us. And it's an earned
attitude."
The Wolverines will start
attempting to earn Hoke, Matti-
son and offensive coordinator Al
Borges' respect when spring prac-
tice starts.
All three coaches have main-
tained that they don't wantto eval-
uate the players and form opinions
until they see them hit and play in
alive situation.
In all aspects of the game, Hoke
has preached toughness and said
he expects a certain level of physi-
cality. But how do you measure
toughness?
"By practicing really hard,"
Mattison said. "You'll see an inten-
sity in our practices, the way it has
to be. And that's a key thing this
year. In the first year of a program,
if you really believe in mental
toughness and if you know that's
what we have to do then you have
to practice that way. It's too late
whenyougetin agame. Otherwise
you're goingto lose those games in

the fourth quarter when someone
isn't mentallytough."
Added Hoke: "I think the con-
sistency of hitting and a consisten-
cy of being physical is something
we always look for."
Good news for Hoke, he and
Wellman share similar philoso-
phies in how to prepare a team.
Since the early shakiness under
Wellman's watchful eye, the
Wolverines have already taken
the steps to understanding what
exactly Hoke wants.
"They understand that there's
an ethic that we want to have
throughout the program and how
we want to work," Hoke said. "And
how we want to show up everyday
with energy and the improvement
side of it.
"I think guys have made
improvements. We're not where
we need to be by any stretch. It's
going to be good to get into spring
football and get the football part of
it taught. At the same time, we'll
need the summer to continually
grow as ateam, with the camara-
derie and the accountability and
the physicalness of it."

ICE HOCKEY
Practice paying off
for M' on power play

Breakdown: Michigan-Tennessee .

By MICHAEL FLOREK
Daily SportsEditor
For about 15 minutes dur-
ing practice everyday, Michigan
coach Red Berenson doesn't have
any defense. He doesn't need it.
Berenson takes his five-man
power play, sticks them in the far
zone, and has the unit execute its
offensive zone power play - five-
on-zero.
The passing is quick and on
the tape, the goals are pretty and
the poor goalie facing the five-
man onslaught is always a step
behind.'
Berensonusuallylets his other
coaches take over the drills while
he stays to the side, giving play-
ers feedback individually and
jumping in at opportune times.
That's not the case for the five-
on-zero power play. The coach
runs it personally, standing just
outside the blue line, having the
players huddle around him.
The whole drill seems a bit
ridiculous to the outside observ-
er - in a game they will never
have as much time or space on
the power play. But for Beren-
son, the drill serves an impor-
tant purpose - so important that
he's done it in every practice this
season.
"I want to see quick move-
ment, receiving passes, moving
the puck quick, not over han-
dling the puck and then seeing
what's open," Berenson said
after practice Tuesday. "I need
to know just about before I get it,
who I'm going to give it to. And
then I need to know where their
stick is and where they are, so I
can give a perfect pass."
Michigan obviously doesn't
work exclusively five-on-zero.
According to senior forward
Louie Caporusso, the initial drill
is just to get the "blueprint" in,
before adding defenders.
With or without opposition,

the Wolverines need the prac-
tice. The power play has fal-
tered for much of the season,
converting at just under 18 per-
cent. Michigan is just 29th in the
country with the man advantage.
And the struggles have come
in bunches. After starting off the
season strong, late in October the
Wolverines began their first of
two streaks in which the power
play was scoreless in 20-plus
chances.
But now, three weeks after
ending the second streak, the
power play is on an upswing -
the Wolverines converted at 23
percent in the last five games.
Michigan scored three goals
with the man advantage in last
weekend's CCHA quarterfinal
series against Bowling Green,
and could have had a few more.
Their passing led to a couple
high-quality chances on the
power play, including one in
which junior defenseman Bran-
don Burlon's slap shot squeaked
through Falcon goaltender
Andrew Hammond's legs and
laid behind him for a split sec-
ond without anyone noticing the
puck was still loose - including
the referee.
And the same things Beren-
son wants to see five-on-zero
- quick puck movement, tape-
to-tape passes, knowing where a
player's teammates are without
having to look up - were listed
as the reasons why the power
play was having success when it
became five-on-five.
"We did a good job making
that first pass tape-to-tape,"
senior forward Carl Hagelin
said. "They were aggressive, but
if you pass it quick and make
good plays, it's going to be tough
to be too aggressive because
they're just going to end up run-
ning around, and we should be
able to find those seam plays."
Maybe practice does pay off.

Under Tennessee coach Bruce
Pearl, the Volunteers have never
failed to have a 20-win season.
Coming into Friday's matchup
with Michigan, the Volunteers
are only one win shy of thatmark.
This is Tennessee's sixth-
consecutive NCAA Tournament
appearance - the ninth-longest
streak in NCAA Division I bas-
ketball. Both teams received at
large bids to the NCAA Tourna-
ment and are looking forward
to a third-round matchup with
Duke. But before thinking about
the Blue Devils, the Wolverines
will need to focus on the Volun-
teers. Here's what their starting
lineups have to offer.
POINT GUARD: MELVIN
GOINS VS. DARIUS MORRIS:
The 5-foot-11 senior is the short-
est scholarship player to play for
Tennessee under Pearl. As the
team's point guard he only aver-
ages three assists a game, and in
the Volunteers' last two games he
was held to one assist each. The
California native also averages
a team-best two steals a game.
While he may be undersized,
Goins has the team's best vertical
(41 inches) and broad jump (10
feet, eight inches).
Sophomore Darius Morris will
have a home state matchup on his
hands when he takes on Goins,
but expect Morris to thrive in the
postseason and take down Goins
as his first victim. Not to men-
tion, Morris' five inch advantage
won't hurt.
ADVANTAGE: MORRIS
WING: SCOTTY HOPSON VS.
STU DOUGLASS: Junior Scotty
Hopson leads the Volunteers
in scoring with 17 points, while
playing just 30 minutes a game.
The 6-foot-7 guard has good size
and quickness and has the abil-
ity to get to the free throw line,
where he shoots 74 percent. His
ability to get to the rim is comple-

mented by his outside shooting
- 45 percent from the floor -
which makes defenders honest
when guarding him. This past
summer he was one of 20 col-
lege basketball players to play
for the USA Basketball Men's
Select Team.
As highly touted of a player
as he is, the junior seems to wax
and wane on the statistics sheet.
In Tennessee's last two games
he showed both sides. Against
Florida on March 11, he had 19
points and got to the free-throw
line six times, but he also had
seven turnovers. The previous
day, against Arkansas, the guard
scored just eight points, turned
the ball over four times and
didn't manage to make his way
to the charity stripe. If Hop-
son shows up to play in the big
dance, junior Stu Douglass will
have his hands full.
ADVANTAGE: HOPSON
WING: JOSH BONE VS. TIM
HARDAWAY JR.: Bone spent
his first two years of college
basketball at Southern Illinois,
but gave up his scholarship
there to be a junior walk on
with the Volunteers last season.
His fierce guard play earned
him a full scholarship this year,
and though this 6-foot-3 senior
spent the first 11 games injured
this season, he's been a main
contributor for Tennessee. He's
the probable starter this Friday,
but it will be just his fourth start
of the season. Pearl started him
over junior Cameron Tatum,
who's started 32 times this sea-
son, but has recently fallen into
a slump.
In Bone's start against Florida
he scored just five points and
grabbed two rebounds before
fouling out. Hardaway Jr., who's
started every game for the Wol-
verines this'year, should be able
to show more poise on the big
stage. Expect the frosh to exploit
the senior.
ADVANTAGE: HARDAWAY
JR.

Redshirt freshman power forward Jordan Morgan may have the edge over the
Volunteers' John Fields dow low on Friday.

FORWARD TOBIAS HARRIS
VS. ZACK NOVAK: The freshman
Harris is the most well-rounded
player Tennessee has this year.
He's a three-time Freshman
of the Week in the SEC and is a
Freshman All-America candi-
date. His nickname is "All Busi-
ness" and Pearl has referred to
Harris as the "most mature and
hard-working freshman" he's
ever coached. He shoots nearly
50 percent from the floor, and
averages 15 points and seven
rebounds a game. In addition
to his shooting, he finishes well
around the basket and pushes the
ball up the floor.
The matchup between Har-
ris and Novak could be the most
interesting of the game - not
just for Harris' all-around skills,
but also because of his inherent
size advantage. But Novak has
spent his three years at Michi-
gan guarding larger players, so
he may surprise Harris with his
ability to stick with the frosh.
ADVANTAGE: HARRIS

CENTER JOHN FIELDS VS.
JORDAN MORGAN: Despite
being a senior, the 6-foot-9
senior is a first-year player at
Tennessee. He started his career
with two years at East Carolina
University before playing his
junior season at the University
of North Carolina-Wilmington.
His career is culminating as
a Volunteer, where he's expe-
riencing less success than in
seasons past. While he has 204
career blocks (he's garnered
seven-block games twice), he's
struggling to score three points
a game and pull down three
boards a game.
Fields may have an inch on
redshirt freshman Jordan Mor-
gan, but Morgan has a 20-pound
advantage over the senior.
Expect a physical battle in the
paint between these two, but
with the leaps and bounds Mor-
gan's made this year, he should
be able to control Fields on the
glass.
ADVANTAGE: MORGAN

FILM TAX
From Page 5B
"Right now our job is to educate
(legislators), to let them know,
'look how this is benefiting the
state, look what it's creating, look
what we're doing,' " Rubin said.
"Look at Danny and I, two kids
who started a production compa-
ny and have helped pump millions
of dollars into the local economy."
But it was never just about the
money. For Sardarov, the impact
of the incentives was shown
through the revitalization of
Detroit, which has seen a grass-
roots Renaissance through the
city's youth.
"The government keeps talking
about numbers and numbers, but
you can't base society off num-
bers," he said. "It's about the spirit
that kind of injects into the soci-
ety - there's this hope, and hope
is intrinsic. You can't buy hope
with numbers, you can't buy hope
with tax incentives."
He went on to tell the story of
shooting a scene in "The Ides of
March" on abus full of extras.
"We get off the bus, and I think
it was George Clooney himself
that said, 'I have never seen this
much passion coming from extras
- they're going at it, they're doing
everything we tell them to do,
you could just see it in their eyes,'
" Sardarov narrated. "People
in Detroit have never had these
opportunities before, suddenly
they're coming in tenfold."
"This is something where peo-
ple can go to the movie theater,
and they can see their city, their
state immortalized up on the
screen," Mooney said. "It's Robo-
cop, it's Detroit, it's Grand Rapids,
it's the gorgeous U.P. That's some-
thing people get proud about."
Burnstien is frustrated by the
resurrection of the "brain drain,"
which had been minimized in
recent years because of the film
incentive laws.
"All those workers that have
been trained, all those young
people we've trained, they've
got a skill, and they're going to
go where the action is," he said.
"That means we're going to lose
them to states like Louisiana,
Ohio and Georgia ... and they'll go
to California."
Michigan filmmakers appear to
have the support of the citizens.
At a town hall meeting in Livonia,
Mich. last month that featured
author and Detroit Free Press
columnist Mitch Albom, actor
Jeff Daniels, Burnstein and oth-
ers speaking against the proposal,

about 4,000 people showed up
when the organizers only expect-
ed an audience of 500.
Despite their activism, many in
the industry are facing the real-
ity that their careers as Michi-
gan filmmakers are potentially
defunct.
"I gave my landlord my two
months notice that I'm moving
out," Zakalik said. "And I'm going
to figure out what I'm going to do.
I thought about moving to North
Carolina, which has a pretty good
business there ... I don't know ...
It's like, what was the point? Why
did we stay if we're just going to
be told we can't get a job tomor-
row?"
Saradov said he was planning
on staying in Michigan until "the
well ran dry."
"If this passes, I'm going to be
going to New York or L.A., unfor-
tunately," Saradov said. "I got on
a good roll, and I want to keep
going. If things were sticking
around here, I'd definitely be here
no question about it."
LSA senior Tian-Jun Gu was
planning to stay around Michi-
gan after graduation and work
with friends to write and produce
viral videos in the vein of "Funny
or Die" - hiring Michigan actors
and crews, of course. But after the
proposal, his plans might change.
"The problem with (Snyder)
even proposing it is the fact that
it scared businesses off," he said.
"Now studios are going to be look-
ing at Michigan to see if we can be
trusted.
"These film incentives, even if
they are kept, are always going
to be in danger of being cut. It's
looking more and more like L.A.
is going to be a possibility for me
because of that inherent danger,
even if the film incentives are
kept."
Still, in the midst of all the
uncertainty, Burnstein sees no
reason to give up hope.
"Do I think we have a reason-
able shot saving this thing? I do,
or I wouldn't be doing it," Burn-
stein said. "Do I think it's a slam
dunk? Of course not. You know, if
we lose, I want to walk away and
be able to tell my students 'I did
everything I could to try and save
this opportunity for you.' If we
fail, we fail, but I'd be damned if
I'm not going to try."
University students, enjoy the
celebrity sightings while you still
can - they may be soon gone
for good. But more importantly,
because of the Governor's pro-
posal, our school's budding actors
and filmmakers may be gone for
good too.

random student interview by stephen ostrowski

Welcome to the Ran-
dom Student Inter-
view, where the line
betweenjournalistic integ-
rity and personal boundaries
becomes blurred.
Did you hear George Clooney's on
campus?
I did hear George Clooney's on
campus.
Have you tried seeking him out
or stalkinghim? In the strictest,
er, least strict,legal sense of the
word?
I have not tried to stalk George
Clooney. I'm not going to be an
extra. I don't have time for that.
Oh, is he seeking extras?
Yeah.
I didn't hear about that.
Is this part of your interview?
No.
Are you supposed to say that?
Because how have you not heard
aboutthat?
Um, ifyou could use two words
to describe George Clooney, and
they're not "silver" and "fox,"
what two words would youuse?
George Clooney? Oh man. I don't
want to say "old" because I'd also

say "attractive" and that'd be a
weird combination, but I'll just say
that.
Old?
Old and attractive. Which is a very
odd combination.
I guess you could say it's up in the
air. Right?
Right.
Bad pun. He made a movie called
"Up in the Air"...
I'm not educated on that.
Yeah, well that won't go in the
interview. It probably will.What
about Rick Snyder coming to
campus to speak? Has that affect-
ed your plans ofgraduating?
Not really, because I'm a freshman.
Do you fear that you'll get a grad-
uation speaker that youmight or
might notlike?
I don't know. I meanI understand
why people are upset because he's

to speak, and people say he's hypo-
critical so there's that issue there,
but I also think a graduation speaker
is such a minute argument to have
and to protest it is stupid.
So you could, in a utopia kind of
world, who would you want as a
graduation speaker?
I was actually just talking about
this earlier. I'm really against the
idea of a utopia. So...
Interestingturn this has taken!
I mean, just to say that it was my
graduation speaker, Jon Bon Jovi,
but that's just because I'm a girl,
and I think he's the greatest person
ever.
I think you're describing a dysto-
pia now. Um, so...
As far as if you want like, "Oh my
god, I had him speak at my gradu-
ation," and if you want you know
your successful political figure

much about because I don't know
how your graduation speaker
affects the rest of your life, I don't
know who I'd want. I don't know.
Name any colloquial figure you'd
want.
For graduation speaker? I mean, I
don't know. I really don't know I'm
sorry.
We'll go with Bon Jovi. So what
opening anthem would he sing to
start off the ceremony?
I will go with ... I don't know, I don't
know any Bon Jovi song that has
any relatability to academia at all.
"Living on a prayer"?
That was my graduation song from
high school.
Interesting. So this is coming full
circle now!
Yes, it is so there we go. That one
works perfectly.
Sylvan is an LSA freshman

it didn't bother me because it was pretty cool.
I get to say, 'I got a bronchoscopy, and I know
what my lungs look like."'
In another study, for which she received $200
dollars in compensation, Collins underwent an
MRI and pressed a button every time she saw a
red dot in a group of colored dots.
Collins tries to participate in as many studies
as she can that don't have restrictions like "must
not be a female in her reproductive years."
When it comes to doing your homework, sit-
ting in a room wearing a contraption resembling
headgear that traces your eye movements for
30 minutes isn't exactly the typical assignment.
For LSA freshman Diana Dodge, that's exactly
how she fulfilled part of her five hour research
requirement for her Communications 102 class.
"It was an uncomfortable study to partici-
pate in," she said. "You literally couldn't move
your body or else the whole machine would be
thrown off because they had to position it in a
specific way."
Roughly seven different pictures of people
positioned alongside blurbs flashed before her
eyes. The study aimed to learn how the subjects
associate the people they see based on their
appearances. Another in-person study she par-
ticipated in required her to watch an hour-long
episode of "Desperate Housewives" and then fill
out a survey afterwards.
To fulfill the rest of the requirements, she
participated ina variety of online studies.
Dodge's only complaint was that the studies
she was eligible to participate in weren't posted
until halfway through the semester, making it
difficult to meet the five-hour requirement.
Dodge said she probably wouldn't have par-
ticipated in the studies if they weren't required.
"I understand why they make some required
because no one would do them if they weren't,"
she said. "I remember them being just a com-
plete hassle. There weren't enough studies
available until late, and it was hard to scramble
to get them all done."
LSA junior Cindy Wang also participated in
a few studies for the same Communications 102
class and though she agreed the studies were
often time-consuming, she also found them fun
and interesting.
One of the studies had her choose the letter A
or B, with each letter representing a video game
of a varying level of violence. After playing the
game she was given $2 dollars and told that after
the researcher left the room she could either
donate to a jar that sat in front of her through-
out the game or keep the money. The hypothesis

was that those who played the less violent game
were more likely to donate the money.
Wang said she realized the importance of stu-
dent participation in studies.
"It's really interesting and pretty fun," Wang
said. "Sometimes I'd sign up with my friends,
and I feel like the school needs participants for
experiments so it's understandable that it be
mandatory even though I'm not interested (in
participating outside of class)."
LSA sophomore Scott Shapiro said he fulfilled
his class requirements by doing a few in-person
studies and a few online studies.
"For some of [ o
these sleep
studies, it's basically
paying you to take
a nap, which is great."
- LSA senior Adam Mael
Shapiro said when he was alone he felt com-
fortable doing whatever was required of him in
the study.
"Usually you were alone so if you were to
do anything weird there was no one around to
watch you," Shapiro said.
Throughout the studies, however, he found
himself questioning the validity of psychology
students participating in psychology studies,
since he feels that psychology students will alter
their answers depending on what they think the
researchers expect to occur.
"When psych students are taking (the stud-
ies) they're thinking about what's going on with
the study so they might alter their answer, and
that messes with the result," he said. "I don't
recall consciously doing that, but if that could
have been happening to me, it could happen to
other people afterwards."
Overall, Shapiro said he valued the studies for
allowing him to see what "real research" is like.
"I've done a little research on my own, and
it was kind of good to see a template of what is
supposed to be done," he said.
Shapiro said he would have enjoyed seeing

cutting money, and then he's coming which I don't necessarily care so

the results of the studies in which he had par-
ticipated.
"I always left (the studies) thinking that I
kind of wanted to learn more about the study
and see the results," Shapiro said. "It would
have been cool for them to go out of their way
and e-mail you with the results and thank you
for participating."
Because the same students are participat-
ing in studies over and over, some might ques-
tion the legitimacy of research using the same
population pool. However, Huesmann said that
though it is contingent on the type of research
beipg done, this doesn't affect the reliability of
results.
"A lot of the studies done are reaction times or
memory based," Huesmann said. "So when the
students are subjects and are challenged to do
things pertaining to the way your brain works
in psychology, there's not much room for bias."
For studies involving the brain, he said it
makes no difference at all whether or not a stu-
dent partakes in one study or 100.
He added that "any good researcher" would
thoroughly screen their subjects to ensure that
the data isn't providing false information. Ask-
ing the subject if they have ever lied is a ques-
tion often used to identify false answers. When
the subject says no, their results are discarded
because everyone lies. Therefore, they must also
be lying.
One of Huesmann's concerns is the represen-
tativeness of the data.
"There is some room for some concern about
the validity of the data, but the biggest concern
is the extent of which University of Michigan
students, particularly underclassmen, are rep-
resentative of a population of people," Hues-
mann said. "That's more of an issue to me than
the concern of whether people are faking the
data."
According to Huesmann, having subjects
participating in more than one study doesn't
affect the results since, in addition to screen-
ing for accuracy of answers, a researcher also
screens to see if the subject has participated in
similar studies in the past that might influence
their replies.
For students like Mael, participating in stud-
ies is a positive experience.
"It's been fun," he said. "I think it's cool to
be a University guinea pig in a sense. There's
all this incredible research being done here and
even though I'm not doing it, I get to partici-
pate in some way and contribute to that. It also
doesn't hiurt that some pay you for your time:"

news in review
Five of the most talked-about stories of the week, ranked in ascending order of actual importance

STUDYING STUDENTS
BY VERONICA MENALDI
Why students donate their bodies and minds to
University research

The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Soft drink titan PepsiCo debuted

First-year graduate student Cailin
Collins may have been vaccinated
for anthrax, but she isn't sure. She
might have received a placebo
instead.
Collins is one of many students who par-
ticipated in a University vaccination study.
In addition to maybe having been vaccinated,
she's had blood drawn multiple times and has
even undergone a bronchoscopy - a medical
procedure that examines the respiratory sys-
tem. Despite the needles and time commit-
ment, she participates in studies whenever
possible.
Whether mandated by a professor or simply
a source of extra income, many University stu-
dents serve as participants in research studies
on campus. Because research studies are a pop-
ular means of obtaining credit in introductory
level communications and psychology courses,
and typically offer approximately $10 per hour,
the subject population often consists of the
same student participants in multiple studies.
Subjects for communication and psychology
studies are either drawn from a participant
pool - which consists of all introductory level
undergraduates - or volunteer students.
Rowell Huesmann, a Amos N. Tversky com-
munication studies and psychology professor
and director of the Research Center for Group
Dynamics, said students are not forced to par-
ticipate in studies. Ifa study doesn't appeal to
them, they are welcome to obtain the required
research hours through other means, such as
writing a research paper. Still, he emphasized
how participating in the study can be a learn-

ing experience in itself.
"The idea, from a learning point of view in
both introductory psychology and introduc-
tory communication studies, is to try and get
students familiar with how research is done,"
Huesmann said. "You can learn by reading or
by participating in research."
Volunteers also comprise a large majority
of the participation pool. Since the volunteers
aren't compensated with fulfilling a course
requirement, they are most often rewarded
monetarily.
"You work for an hour, you get $10 or so,"
Huesmann said. "You should be compensated
for devoting your time. My bigger concern is
subjects who agreed to participate without
being paid might have some ulterior motive. I
feel more comfortable when subjects have been
paid for participation."
During LSA senior Adam Mael's freshman
and sophomore years, he participated in psy-
chology studies as often as he could to get extra
spending money, since he didn't have a paying
job at the time.
In his freshman year, Mael wanted to go to
a concert at the Blind Pig in Ann Arbor, but
didn't have the money to attend. To solve the
problem, Mael went to one study each week
for a month and saved the money he earned in
order to attend the concert.
Of the variety of studies he's participated in,
the two that most stand out to him pertained to
sleeping and interpersonal relationships with
strangers.
'For some of these sleep studies, it's basi-
cally paying you to take a nap, which is great,"

Mael said.
The second study had Mael sit in a room and
write an essay about the conflict in the Middle
East in five minutes. The essay was to be grad-
ed by a student in another room also participat-
ing in the study.
Mael didn't know who this student was, and
once he received his essay back, he was shocked
to see remarks written all over the paper saying
that it was the worst thing the reader had ever
read and that it was a "piece of trash."
Shortly after looking over the comments
Mael was hooked up to a machine and asked to
think about that person for five minutes. At the
end of study, Mael was informed that there was
not actually another person in the room. The
remarks he read weren't true and were only
recorded to see how he'd react. Naturally, Mael
was relieved to hear this.
For Collins who has volunteered as a subject
since she was an undergraduate - participating
in studies is about helping out the researchers.
"Being a researcher myself, I know how
important it is and how it can be really difficult
to find volunteers," she said. "It's good money,
but that's not why I do it. It's also an interesting
experience, and it helps them out."
In one of the studies, Collins had a bronchos-
copy - a medical analysis of the lungs - per-
formed on her. She was on mild sedatives for
the three-hour procedure and received $400
dollars.
"The procedure wasn't uncomfortable
because they numb you throughout it, and I got
to watch them go down into my lung," she said.

..................................* Proposed caps ontheFim
L O S IN G By Kavi Shekhar Pandey Tax Incentive will shake
up the lives of Michigan
. thevfilmmakers.

E xcitement is all around us: students talking in class, pass-
ersby chatting on the Diag, status updates and tweets -
"George Clooney is filming a movie on campus!!!" (give or take
a few exclamation marks).
The movie is "The Ides of March," which Clooney has been
shooting in University locales this week. A-list stars Ryan Gos-
ling, Evan Rachel Wood, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Marisa
Tomei and Paul Giamatti will be alongside Clooney's ownsuper-
nova star wattage.
For much of the University's student body, it's a familiar
thrill. Thanks to the Michigan Film Tax Incentives passed in
2008, the campus was buzzing as Clive Owen, Adam Brody,
Drew Barrymore, Hilary Swank and more of Hollywood's finest
shot movies in and around Ann Arbor over the past few years.
But with Republican Gov. Rick Synder's recent proposal to
significantly reduce the state's film tax incentives, the days of
Michigan movie shoots might be comingto an end. For most stu-
dents, it means the last of texting friends at Michigan State Uni-
versity that they just saw David Schwimmer in the Law Quad.
But for University alum and current students pursuing careers
in Michigan's film and television industries, Snyder's proposal
has completely shattered their world, leaving them with pangs
of anxiety about their future in the industry.
The Golden Age of Michigan Movies
The idea for the film tax incentives took root at the end of
former Republican Gov. John Engler's term in 2002, according
to Jim Burnstein, screenwriting coordinator in the University's
Department of Screen Arts and Cultures. Burnstein was asked
to join the Michigan Film Advisory Commission, which worked
to boost film production in the state.
The council's main goals were to increase jobs by increasing

film production, building infrastructure to create a permanent
film industry and, as Burnstein likes to call it, reversing the
"brain drain" - or losing in-state residents to out-of-state jobs.
"We were trying to keep people who I teach and people who
come out of our program and all the other talented students
at U of M, MSU, Wayne State and all the other great schools,"
Burnstein said. "Get them to stay home, because certainly,
there wasn't anythingthat was getting our creative class to stay
home."
Burnstein and the council then worked with former Demo-
cratic Gov. Jennifer Granholm to finally pass the incentives in
April 2008, offering a tax credit of up to 42 percent of a pro-
duction's expenditures. Film production in Michigan exploded
almost immediately after. In 2007, three movies were shot in
Michigan, spending about $2 million in production costs. In the
nine months of 2008 that the incentive laws were in effect, 38
projects were filmed in Michigan, including Clint Eastwood's
"Gran Torino" and Drew Barrymore's "Whip It" - contributing
to about $125 million in expenditures.
"For five years, I said, 'If you build it, they will come'... well
they came," Burnstein said. "And they came in greater numbers
than our projections."
University alum Marc Zakalik couldn't have finished his
Screen Arts and Cultures degree at a better time. He graduated
in April 2008, and about three days later, he got a call to work
on one of the first movies to take advantage of the incentives -
Miguel Arteta's "Youth in Revolt" starring Michael Cera.
"I started off as an unpaid intern helping outMiguel," Zakalik
said. "But a lot of what I was doing was helping him break down
the script and helping him rewrite it ... which was cool because I
studied screenwriting in college. It was an amazing experience,
especially so soon after graduating - I was with him 13 to 14
hours a day for about three weeks straight."
Two fellow gradu-
ates of the Universi-
ty's SAC program and

native Michiganders, Danny Mooney and Eddie Rubin, were
able to start their own production company in Michigan because,
of the incentives. The duo, who first joined forces in one of Burn-
stein's SAC classes, launched Deep Blue Pictures and completed
two feature films by the time Rubin graduated in 2009.
"We always wanted to stay in Michigan - our crews were
here that we loved to work with and obviously our families,"
Mooney said. "The tough reality is, in the film industry, L.A. and
New York are the places to be ... that's just where the deals are
going. That's where all the shoots were.
"It was a bummer, but when the incentives passed, we were
like, 'Hold up one second, this might actually work."'
Mooney said starting his company in Michigan quickly
became the smartest business decision he ever made. He and
Rubin have made five films during the incentive program, have
given more than 50 jobs to Michigan graduates and hundreds of
jobs to other Michiganders to work on films, commercials and
music videos.
"If we were in L.A. right now, we'd be getting coffee for some-
one," Rubin said. "On top of just getting to bigger fish ina small
pond, we had the support of our family and our friends - where
in L.A., if we had been on our own, it would have been harder to
survive. If we tried to start our own company there, we might
have had to get a part-time job bussing tables."
Films shooting in Michigan also allowed University students
currently enrolled to find gigs while taking classes. University
alum Yuriy Sardarov, who graduated in December 2010 as a the-
ater major, got his first break last spring.
"One of my professors referred me to these casting agents. It
was for this straight-to-DVD action movie," Sardarov said. "And
I had a few callbacks, I got the part, I got into a really good rela-
tionship with the casting directors and they kept sending me out
to do stuff and I kept getting parts - these were all in Michi-
gan."
After his debut, Sardarov worked on two other features
before landing a role in "The Ides of March."

'Black Thursday'
In 2009, film production in Michigan continued to swell. The
first full year of the tax incentives led to 43 productions that
spent $223.6 million in Michigan. Last year, Michigan's film
industry hit its peak, spending more than $300 million for 58
projects including "Scream 4," "A Very Harold & Kumar Christ-
mas," "Transformers: Dark of the Moon" and Hugh Jackman's
"Real Steel."
"We were in that elite group of regional film industries if
you're looking outside the coasts," Burnstein said. "And really,
we owned the Midwest - we were at the top of the food chain."
The Michigan film industry locomotive appeared to be
unstoppable as 2011 began. The state bagged "The Avengers,"
the long-in-the-making Marvel superhero team-up movie fea-
turing Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, The Hulk, Hawkeye
and Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, to be partially filmed in
Michigan. But with an approximate budget of $105.million, the
jewel in the crown was "Oz: The Great and Powerful," directed
by Sam Raimi (Spider-Man) and starring James Franco, to be
filmed in Pontiac's Raleigh Studios - a just-converted facility
that was once a General Motors plant, offering over 175,000
square feet for its sound stages.
The incentives appeared to be making a positive economic
impact on the state. According to a study conducted by the
accounting firm Ernst & Young, film productions in Michigan
created more than 2,600 jobs in 2009 and more than 3,800 in
2010 - both direct and indirect jobs com-
bined. Dollar- ... -...

wise, this translated to a total state resident income impact of
$108.9 million in 2009 and $172.5 million in 2010.
But it all came to a screeching halt on Feb. 17, 2011, which
Rubin comically coined "Black Thursday." Snyder unveiled a
proposal that would completely restructure Michigan's film tax
incentives. Under the new plan, the essentially unlimited up-to
42 percent tax credit would be replaced by a yearly cap of $25
million - with $75 million in additional honored subsidies over
the next fiscal year - to be handed out in appropriations each
year.
"When people say (the current incentives program is) a tax
credit, they think what that means is you're reducing your tax
liability - instead of what you owe on your taxes, we're reduc-
ing it by 42 percent," said Ryan Kazmirzack, a spokesman for
Snyder. "That is not how it works - it is actually a subsidy. The
state of Michigan literally writes a check. Instead of saying,
'You owe less money,' Michigan is actually paying out moneyto
Hollywood film producers ... we came to the conclusion that the
film subsidy right now, is unsustainable."
Kazmirzack called the Ernst & Young study "flawed," argu-
ing that it was commissioned by organizations that had an
interest in maintaining the incentives. He then explained that,
according to the governor, a significant flaw in the current
incentives program is that it is not capped. He explained that if
a production spent $1 billion, the state would pay out $420 mil-
lion in subsidies, at the maximum.
"Right there is pretty much the entire amount that has to be
cut from education," Kazmirzack said. "There is no way you can
budget not knowing how much you have to give out."
For Michigan filmmakers, the announcement was a crush-
ing blow.
"To be completely honest - I cried," Rubin said. "Literally,
no joke, no exaggeration. I was devastated, thinking we had
built our company off the backs of the incentive and used it to
not only benefit ourselves but benefit the state, benefit so many
of our friends and colleagues."
Before Snyder's proposal, Mooney said "everyone in the film
industry here was just flying."
"People were getting new jobs, our friends were buying new
places, getting new cars ... it wasn't like people were getting rich
off this," he said. "Everyone was makinga stable, solid income.
But that day, everyone we knew became unemployed besides a
couple film sets."
Zakalik said he felt "cheated."
"I've been, for the lack of a better term, busting
my ass in this industry trying to make some-
' thing of it. I'm really happy here, and to hear

that my job is just going to disappear overnight is really, really
frustrating."
Snyder had alluded to his dislike of the state's generous film
tax incentives on the campaign trail, so his proposal was not a
blindside to the industry. What was unexpected was the extent
to which the governor wished to reduce the program.
"I think it's kind of ridiculous," Zakalik explained. "It's a slap
in the face - you might as well throw the $25 million out of the
window. It's being wasted."
"We knew he was going to bring it down to 30, 35 (percent).
We were thinking we would still be competitive," Rubin said.
"But with the $25 million cap he pulled the rug out from under
the industry. There is no way the industry can survive on the
cap."
Beyond the cap, Rubin isworried about the proposal's require-
ment that the incentives will be doled out in appropriations.
"Every year, the film community will have to come before
the appropriations committee and state their case, 'I think we
deserve this money,' " he explained. "So even if you have say,
$100 million in appropriations, you're never going to have long-
term commitments - infrastructure, studios - built because
there's a chance next year that they may not get the money."
' The first apparent casualty of the proposal was "The Aveng-
ers," which pulled out of Michigan to film in Cleveland, Ohio
after producers were unsure whether they would be receiving
the tax incentives.
But according to Kazmirzack, Michigan let "The Avengers"
film crew leave because of the irrational demands of the pro-
ducers.
"They put in their application and demanded an answer by
5 p.m. as to whether we were going to give them literally mil-
lions of dollars," he said. "That was not reasonable. Of course
the state is not going to approve a request with one day's notice
to give away millions of dollars."
Burnstein was disappointed to lose such a high-profile proj-
ect, especially to Michigan's rivals.
"The governor (of Ohio) is acting like it's the Ohio State-
Michigan game, and he just won," he said. "And he did, that's
the sad part."
Moving Out of Miigan
Mooney, Rubin, Burnstein and other filmmakers have been
working to fight Snyder's proposal, attending tax policy and
budget hearings and talking to state legislators before it passes
into law.
See FILM TAX, Page 8B

MOVIES FILMED IN OTHER STATES
"The Last Song" (left) was filmed in North
Carolina, and "The Soloist" (below) was par-
tially filmed in Ohio. If the proposed cuts to the
tax incentive are passed, it's likely that Michigan
will lose more movies to other states.
