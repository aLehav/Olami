Average of 80 

individuals relocated 

to Washtenaw 

County annually

By BRIAN KUANG

Daily Staff Reporter

Editor’s note: The name of a 

refugee in this story has been 
changed because of potential 
implications on his family or 
future refugees, denoted with a 
star.

For 
over 
half 
his 
life, 

Hassan* has been without a 
country to call home. As a small 
boy, he fled from Somalia in 
1992 amid a civil war, arriving 
in Kenya alongside hundreds 
of thousands of other Somali 
refugees.

Now, Hassan, his wife, and 

his four children — the oldest 
six years old, the youngest one 
year old— are starting their life 
again in Washtenaw County. 
About 80 refugees per year 

are resettled by Jewish Family 
Services of Washtenaw County, 
the only resettlement agency in 
the area. 

Hassan 
and 
his 
family 

applied through the United 
Nations High Commissioner 
for Refugees for resettlement 
as asylum-seekers in 2009. 
After seven years of screenings 
and waiting, he learned he 
was one of the few to have 
his 
application 
approved. 

According to UNHCR, less than 
1% of all refugees registered 
with the United Nations are 
resettled in new countries.

Continuous 
warfare 
and 

famine has prevented many 
refugees 
like 
Hassan 
from 

returning to Somalia — one 
group 
of 
many 
worldwide 

that are finding their home 
countries inhospitable. More 
than 400,000 Somali refugees 
remain in Kenya — primarily 
in decades-old refugee camps 
— according to the UNHCR. 
However, while in the country 
they are not issued legal work

Matisyahu performs at Hill Auditorium Monday.

Students say Music 

Matters concert 
falls short of pro-

peace message

By LARA MOEHLMAN

Daily Staff Reporter

Jewish-American 
reggae 

and 
alternative 
rock 
artist 

Matisyahu 
joined 
Ann 

Arbor native Nadim Azzam, 

a 
Palestinian-American 

performer, 
for 
a 
concert 

intended to promote peace 
and unity at the University of 
Michigan Monday night.

Following the event, many 

students 
said 
they 
were 

impressed 
by 
both 
Azzam 

and Matisyahu’s presence and 
musicality. However, several 
also noted a lack of content 
explicitly engaging with the 
theme of unity. The stop was 
part of a nationwide college 
tour for Matisyahu, who is 

known for his political and 
social activism, with the self-
professed aim of promoting 
peace.

The concert, hosted by the 

University’s 
Hillel 
and 
the 

student organization MUSIC 
Matters, drew a crowd of 
roughly 500 students to Hill 
Auditorium.

In a March interview with 

The Michigan Daily, Matisyahu 
said he conceived the college 
tour idea after he was asked to 
make anti-Israel comments at 

a music festival in Spain last 
summer. 

After he refused, he said he 

was kicked out of the festival 
before being invited back to 
Spain to play another concert 
amid 
the 
controversy. 
He 

then played despite protests 
from Boycott, Divestment and 
Sanctions movement protesters 
throughout his performance. 

“This concert series and 

these shows is really not about 
politics,” he said in March.

Opposition group 

says Lumm’s e-mails 

show bias on deer 
management plan

By BRIAN KUANG

Daily Staff Reporter

Opponents of the Ann Arbor 

deer cull accused the body of 
unethical 
behavior 
prior 
to 

the cull’s approval in 2015, 
calling for the resignation of 
Councilmember Jane Lumm (I–
Ward 2) at Monday’s City Council 
meeting.

Local residents opposed to the 

city’s deer management program 
— a long-termpolarizing issue 
that concluded its first iteration 
in early March — accused Lumm 
of having an unethically close 
relationship 
with 
deer 
cull 

advocates from 2014 to 2015.

The activists, led by Ann 

Arbor resident Sabra Sanzotta, 
said Lumm has an undisclosed 
relationship with the pro-cull 
advocacy 
group 
Washtenaw 

Citizens for Ecological Balance. 
Sanzotta and other activists 
cited several of Lumm’s e-mails, 
obtained through a Freedom of 
Information Act request, as a 
basis for their argument.

Similar charges were leveled 

against Lumm and WC4EB in 
January from a different set 
of e-mails. Ann Arbor resident 
Jennifer Robertson cited those 
e-mails to claim Lumm had 
forwarded city documents to 
WC4EB before they were made 
public, and that WC4EB provided 
personal information on public 

opponents to the cull through 
2014 and 2015.

“We are being poisoned by toxic 

cronyism and the indifference of 
our elected officials,” Robertson 
said at Monday’s meeting, calling 
on Lumm to resign.

In response to the charge, 

multiple council members and 
Mayor 
Christopher 
Taylor 

(D) came to Lumm’s defense, 
drawing angry responses from 
many residents in attendance 
and causing Taylor to call the 
chamber to order multiple times.

Taylor specifically noted that 

though he was the only individual 
to vote against the cull and often 
disagrees with Lumm, he did not 
believe any of her actions were 
unethical.

“I’ve endorsed opponents of 

(Lumm)” Taylor said. “If she runs 
again, I’ll probably do it again, 
because we don’t vote the same 
on many issues. However, I have 
heard nothing that shakes my 
confidence in Councilmember 
Lumm’s 
ethical 
behavior 
in 

this matter. Building coalitions 
with citizens and colleagues is 
democracy in action … she has 
been an effective public servant 
in 
this 
regard, 
although 
I 

disagree with it.”

Councilmember 
Chuck 

Warpehoski (D–Ward 5) also 
said Lumm’s involvement with 
local activists was in no way 
unethical, comparing it with his 
own involvement with a summer 
youth work program sponsored 
by 
the 
Washtenaw 
County 

Sheriff’s Department.

“I don’t that there is some 

cronyism that puts me in the 
pocket of the ‘summer jobs’

Current, former 
college presidents 
explore need for 
public universities

By LUCAS MAIMAN

For the Daily

Mary 
Sue 
Coleman, 

University 
of 
Michigan 

president emerita, returned 
to campus Monday night to 
discuss accessibility in public 
higher education alongside 
current University President 
Mark Schlissel.

Schlissel 
and 
Coleman 

joined 
other 
panelists 
to 

address the goals of the 
Lincoln 
Project, 
a 
policy 

discussion headed by the 
American Academy of Arts 
and Sciences which aims to 
consider the implication of 
reduced state investment in 
public education and the role 
of the federal government 
in funding public research 
universities. 
Coleman 

currently 
serves 
as 
the 

president of the Association 
of American Universities, and 
is a co-chair on the Lincoln 
Project.

In his welcome and call to 

order at the event, Schlissel 
said 
research 
universities 

allow students to engage in 
interactive and innovative 
modes of learning.

“At a research university, 

your children learn from 
faculty that are creating new 
knowledge,” Schlissel said. 
“They’re defining what the 
current limits are of human 
knowledge and what the next 
questions to be answered are. 
Students get to participate in 
the act of discovery.”

Coleman said the Lincoln 

Project has cast a light on 
the importance of public 
research 
universities. 
The 

Lincoln Project has produced 
four publications about the 
importance, shift in funding, 
economic role and finances of 
these institutions.

Other 
panel 
members 

included 
Patrick 
Doyle, 

president 
and 
CEO 
of 

Domino’s; M. Roy Wilson, 
president of Wayne State 
University; and Lou Anna 
K. 
Simon, 
president 
of 

Michigan State University. 
The leaders all discussed 
how investments into public 
universities serve as fuel for 
driving the nation’s economy.

In 
Michigan, 
Simon 

said 
the 
Lincoln 
Project 

highlights why the portion 
of the education budget that 
is a part of the research at 
universities has declined. In 
2011, Gov. Rick Snyder (R) 
 

cut state funding to higher 
education 
by 
15 
percent, 

funding has gone up in small 
increments since then. In 
the 
2017-2018 
fiscal 
year 

recommendations, 
Snyder 

recommended 
increasing 

higher education allocation 
to pre-2011 levels. 

Doyle, who also serves 

as the chair of the board of 
directors for the Business 
Leaders of Michigan, said 
public higher education is

Warde 
Manuel, 
University 

of Michigan athletic director, 
emphasized 
the 
seriousness 

he 
places 
on 
academics 
for 

student athletes at Monday’s 
Senate Advisory Committee on 
University Affairs meeting.

“We 
drive 
our 
student 

athletes to be very successful 
academically,” Manuel said. “Not 
just for eligibility purposes, but for 
themselves and their lives.”

Manuel, who was appointed 

in January to succeed Interim 
Athletic Director Jim Hackett, 
visited SACUA for the first time 
since his appointment to talk 
about the relationship between the 
Athletic Department and faculty.

SACUA 
Chair 
Silke-Maria 

Weineck, 
a 
professor 
of 

comparative 
literature, 
said 

correspondence 
between 
the 

Athletic Department and faculty 
has lessened in the past few years.

“I think there’s a bit of a sense 

from 
your 
predecessors 
that 

the faculty and the Athletic 
Department have drifted apart, 
for lack of better words,” Weineck 
said. “And there hasn’t been a lot of 
interaction between the Athletic 
Department and the faculty.” 

Faculty 
members 
echoed 

Weineck’s 
statement, 
saying 

they felt faculty members were 
not given a voice due to poor

Camp Kesem, a student 

organization at the University of 
Michigan tabled in Mason Hall 
Monday to sell tickets for a benefit 
concert next Tuesday, April 12. The 
concert aims to raise funds for their 
organization.

Camp Kesem sends children 

who have one or more parents 
with cancer to a camp to connect 
and bond through their shared 
experiences. LSA freshman Kaitlin 
McKernan said she believes the 
organization’s mission is very 
impactful for young people.

“It gives the kids a community 

where they can be with other kids 
who have been through the same 
thing and it just gives them a family 
and a break from what’s going on at 
home,” she said.

Tabling in Mason Hall is not 

their only method of fundraising, 
McKernan added.

“We’ve been fundraising 

individually and we’ve been doing 
different events. We’ve been 
bucketing, doing events like these 
concerts, bake sales,” she said.

Musical groups that will be 

performing at the concert include 
Rella, Shaaka, G-Men, Parkway and 
Columbia and My Girlfriend Beau.

58 Greene Acapella will also host 

a music concert this week on Friday 
with featuring appearances from 
dance groups funKtion and EnCore.

The acapella show this year is 

titled “Greenovirus,” which Music 
sophomore Timothy Everett said 
was a pun.

“It’s a play off of the norovirus 

epidemic that went on campus. We 
kind of spinned it to have our own 
mutation of the virus, but this is just 
the theme; it doesn’t have anything 
to do with what we’re actually going 
to perform,” he said.

Like Camp Kesem, tabling in 

Mason Hall is not their only method 
of accruing an audience for their 
performances. Most of their sales, 
Everett said, are made outside of 
Mason Hall, which is not a venue 
that usually attracts most people for 
ticket sales.

“We don’t usually sell super 

well from the table, we do a lot of 
individual sales outside selling by 
ourselves,” he said. “This is good 
just for getting recognition out. This 
is really good for just people seeing 
our name, people seeing faces they 
recognize and just being reminded 
that there’s a concert.”

worthy of investment because of 
the economic development that 
comes out of such institutions. 
He said students who receive 
four-year degrees earn more 
than 
students 
who 
receive 

two-year degrees, who in turn 
receive more than students who 
receive high school degrees.

“We believe that the research 

and knowledge that is being 
generated from the universities 
is critical to economic growth 
in the country as economies 
become more and more about 
knowledge and potentially less 
about making things,” he said.

Wilson 
said 
intertwining 

real-world business experiences 
with an academic background 
provides a newer, integrated 
way of thinking. In particular, 
he pointed to a recent $40 
million 
donation 
to 
Wayne 

state 
from 
Detroit 
business 

moguls Mike and Marian Ilitch 
to help build the Mike Ilitch 
School of Business. Mike and 
Marian Illitch are the parents of 
University regent Denise Illitch 
(D-Bingham Farms). 

“All the publicity has been 

about the Mike Ilitch School we 
are putting right next to the Red 
Wings Stadium, but what I’m 
excited about is the curriculum 
because 
we’ve 
talked 
to 

the Ilitch’s about creating a 
curriculum 
that 
focuses 
on 

entertainment 
and 
sports,” 

he said. “How do you protect 
some inches of change that in 
other periods of time in our 
society people knew were going 
to be really valuable beyond a 
formulaic definition?”

Coleman said the Lincoln 

Project will be releasing its final 
recommendations on what in a 
few days.

“The final recommendations 

will be presented on April 7 in 
Washington D.C., but we wanted 
to have a discussion today 
about the ways in which these 
public institutions are well-
integrated into the intellectual 
infrastructure of the country,” 
Coleman said. “And why keeping 
the intellectual infrastructure 
of the country strong is really 
important.” 

Fourth iteration 
of run sees 30 

percent increase in 

participants

By CHETALI JAIN

Daily Staff Reporter

On Saturday morning, the 

University of Michigan’s Red 
Cross Club held their 4th 
annual Run for the Red 5K at 
Nichols Arboretum. Among 
the participants in the run were 
students from various campus 
organizations, including the 
American 
Medical 
Student 

Association, the Foundation 
for 
International 
Medical 

Relief for Children and Delta 
Sigma Sorority.

The community-based 5K 

is one of the Red Cross Club’s 
biggest fundraisers of the year, 

according to organizers. More 
than 200 people registered 
to run on Saturday, about a 
30 percent increase from last 
year.

Business junior Hani Elhor, 

who has been helping organize 
the run since his freshman 
year, said the event is a great 
way to reach out to students 
from all around the campus 
to bring them together. The 
Red Cross club uses “What do 
you run for?” as their slogan to 
make the event interactive for 
all participants.

Elhor noted many students 

have different ideas of what 
they’ll come out to run for 
and said this unique mix of 
motivations makes the event 
successful.

“We noticed that there 

are so many philanthropic 
organizations on campus and 
we really want to highlight 
what people run for,” Elhor 

said. 
“People 
sometimes 

run for other things too like 
happiness and wine.”

When asked what she runs 

for, LSA freshman Audrey 
Schwartz said she wanted to 
push herself for a good cause.

“I haven’t run a 5K in a 

while, and I wanted to prove 
to myself (that) I could do it,” 
she said. “I’m most excited to 
finish it.”

This 
year’s 
leadership 

team consisted of about 22 
members, and the team was 
divided 
into 
three 
main 

planning branches: marketing, 
PR and logistics.

“(Accounting) 
for 
the 

weather is the hardest part 
about planning this event … it 
was snowing this morning,” 
Elhor said.

Engineering 
junior 
Alex 

Mundorf, who was part of 
the logistics team and also 
participated in the run, said 

the 
event 
has 
been 

increasingly popular in

Warpehoski 

said. “I have disagreed with 
Councilmember 
Lumm 
about 

many things … but I have never 
known her to turn her brain off and 
hand it to somebody else. I’ve never 
seen her advance a position that she 
doesn’t personally believe in.”

When the similar accusations 

that 
WC4EB 
had 
unethically 

influenced Council to back the 
deer cull were raised earlier this 
year, WC4EB member Bernie 
Banet dismissedthem in a January 

interview.

“All groups were communicating 

with 
council 
as 
we 
have 
a 

constitutional right to do, we 
have every right to petition our 
government,” Banet said. “The 
notion that there were some 
improper connections or magical 
power, other than the information 
that we provided, is kind of 
laughable.”

Following 
the 
public 

commentary, 
City 
Council 

also voted to approve a special 
election on Aug. 2 for a millage 
on street, bridge and sidewalk 
repair. If approved, the tax will 
raise $11.25 million in its first 

year. Councilmembers Jack Eaton 
(D–Ward 4), Sumi Kailasapathy 
(D–Ward 1) and Lumm voted 
in opposition, voicing concerns 
that the guidelines on what these 
funds would be spent on aren’t 
sufficiently strict.

“By broadening the scope of 

permitted uses (for funds raised 
through this tax), by definition 
that reduces the amount of funding 
available for fixing the roads,” 
Lumm said. “I don’t think for a 
minute that the amount we will 
be diverting from fixing roads will 
be inconsequential, insignificant 
or not having any impact on our 
ability to fix the roads.”

“One of the main points that 
I’m trying to come at is it’s 
not about choosing sides, but 
it’s about being honest with 
yourself and trying to learn 
about all the different sides 
and trying to connect to 
something human.”

LSA 
freshman 
Timothy 

Mayer said he was drawn 
to the event for its unique 
attempt to promote unity 
through music. He said while 
he enjoyed the performance 
overall, he thought there was 
an apparent lack of discussion 
on peace and inclusion.

“I don’t think it did as much 

as it could have,” Mayer said.

LSA sophomore Kevin Wolf 

said he enjoyed the concert, 
but 
also 
echoed 
Mayer’s 

thoughts concerning the lack 
of discussion of unity and 
inclusion. 

“I thought it was great. 

I thought there was a lot of 
positive energy,” Wolf said. 
“I’m a big Matisyahu fan.”

But in particular on the 

topic of inclusion and peace, 
Wolf said he noted a lack of 
attention.

“I wish it came through a 

little more,” Wolf said. “He 
was a little quiet, so to speak, 

during the show. He didn’t 
really say hi to the audience.”

He did note, however, that 

a subtle message of unity was 
depicted in a collaborative 
song between Azzam and 
Matisyahu.

LSA junior Seif Saqallah 

expressed a similar sentiment, 
saying the performance could 
have been stronger had the 
two performed more numbers 
together.

For 
LSA 
sophomore 

Natasha 
Desai, 
a 
MUSIC 

Matters 
member, 
the 

performance 
was 
overall 

impressive.

“Honestly one of the best 

shows ever,” she said. “He 
was so into his music. He was 
so into everything he was 
doing.”

Matisyahu 
declined 

comment 
immediately 

following the event.

In March, he said the 

concert would not take a 
specific political stance on 
any issue, but would instead 
focus on fostering acceptance, 
peace and love.

“You can talk about love, 

you can talk about politics, 
you can speak about right and 
wrong, but when it comes to 
art and to music, it bypasses 
all of it and resonates inside 
of you and makes you feel a 
certain way,” he said.

communication.

“There was less and less 

communication 
and 
open 

dialogue,” SACUA member John 
Lehman, a professor of biology, 
said. “We want to make sure 
faculty has a very good dialogue 
with (the Athletic Department).”

Manuel said he wants to make 

every effort to connect with 
faculty and the campus.

“If I see something in the Daily 

or in the Record that I’d like to 
attend, I will,” Manuel said. “Part 
of it is my own interests in doing 
what I can to get out into the 
community and be visible to talk 
to faculty and students about what 
they’re doing.”

Manuel also said he believes 

faculty 
and 
athletics 
should 

support one another, as well as 
students.

“One thing you’ll find out about 

me is I’m not there because there’s 
PR, I’m there because I think we 
all need to find a way to support 
what each other are doing,” 
Manuel said.

At a SACUA meeting in 

November 
2014, 
University 

President 
Mark 
Schlissel 

discussed 
the 
challenges 
of 

admiting and working with 
student athletes to the point of 
graduation, saying, “We admit 
students who aren’t as qualified, 
and it’s probably the kids that we 
admit that can’t honestly, even 
with lots of help, do the amount 
of work and the quality of work 
it takes to make progression 

from year to year,” he said. 
“These past two years have 
gotten better, but before that, the 
graduation rates were terrible, 
with football somewhere in the 
50s and 60s when our total six-
year rate at the University is 
somewhere near 90 percent, so 
that’s a challenge.”

SACUA 
and 
Manuel 

additionally heavily discussed 
the difficulties student athletes 
face in balancing their respective 
sport and schoolwork. Manuel 
said 
he 
believes 
schoolwork 

should be the primary focus 
for athletes, listing five things 
from student athletes: academic 
success, athletic success, growing 
as a young adult, following the 
rules and having fun.

He 
also 
touched 
on 
the 

recent controversy surrounding 

concussions and student athletes. 
A recent University study on 
concussions found male football 
players are at a 75-percent risk 
for concussion, and 78 percent of 
concussions occur during games, 
as opposed to practices.

“By fun, it doesn’t mean easy,” 

he said. “It means fun doing all of 
that and being a student, athlete 
and person, and growing and 
learning in this environment,” 
Manuel said.

On 
campus, 
University 

practices 
regarding 
handling 

concussions during football games 
draw criticism, after the 2014 
game against Minnesota in which 
then-Kinesiology 
sophomore 

quarterback Shane Morris was 
sent back in to play after hitting 
his head, an injury that was 
confirmed as a concussion after 
the game.

“I’m 
not 
involved 
in 
the 

decision-making as it relates 
to when somebody is able to 
participate after the concussion, 
and I’m aware enough to know of 
the extent of the research that’s 
reported publicly,” Manuel said. “I 
do not consider myself, nor will I 
ever consider myself, an expert at 
it. I will rely heavily on the medical 
staff to make the determination 
about students’ ability to continue 
playing in a game or when they 
come back.”

Business Prof. Dave Wright 

said the impact of athletics on the 
University’s brand is extremely 
high — and as such, the Athletic 
Department 
holds 
significant 

power 
in 
determining 
the 

perception of the University.

“All of us collectively work 

really hard for the brand and the 
reputation of this University, and 

we are really blessed and honored 
to work for a school that really 
is the leaders and best at both 
athletics and academics,” Wright 
said. “That’s a rare breed. I can 
screw up in the classroom, botch 
a piece of research or whatever 
and we get a little attention in my 
area but not much. Nothing can 
change the brand quicker than 
some of the high-profile athletes 
and coaches.”

After 
the 
discussion 
with 

Manuel, SACUA discussed the 
Office of Institutional Equity 
appeals policy and drafted a 
resolution for Faculty Senate. 
Weineck said the current OIE 
appeals policy allows faculty 
to appeal sanctions but not to 
appeal investigation findings of 
the OIE investigations. Since the 
new sexual misconduct policy, 
announced in March to go into 
effect in July, allows students file 
grievances with both sanctions 
and findings, SACUA members 
said the same procedure should 
apply to faculty.

“Currently, people can grieve 

the sanctions but not appeal the 
findings, which we think is a bit of 
a mismatch,” Weineck said.

The resolution states the desire 

for faculty to have a parallel 
or similar grievance policy to 
students. The Faculty Senate will 
vote on the resolution at the next 
meeting on April 18.

SACUA 
also 
elected 

Engineering Prof. Bill Schultz, 
current vice chair, to Chair of 
SACUA for the next academic 
year. Schulz ran against Lehman 
and won in a 5-3 vote. In addition, 
Wright was appointed to be the 
next vice chair.

Detroit, Flint 
to receive $55 
million in federal 
aid 

Detroit and Flint will receive 

$55 million from the federal 
governement for the demolition 
of blighted buildings from the 
U.S. Department of Treasury, 
the Detroit Free Press reported.

The funds are a part of 

a $74.5 million package of 
“Hardest Hit” funds given to 
the state to help stabilize the 
housing market. 

From the funds, $41.9 million 

will go to Detroit and $13.9 
million will go to Flint, both 
for demolition purposes. The 
remaining $18.6 million will be 
allocated to help homeowners 
who are struggling with their 
mortgages. 

Michigan initially received 

$498 million from the Hardest 
Hit Fund when the program 
was first introduced in 2010 
following housing price declines 
and high unemployment. The 
most recent funding brings the 
state’s total federal dollars to 
$572.5 million. 

Gov. Rick Snyder said in a 

press release Monday the funds 
are important in aiding the 
residents of cities suffering 
from deteriorating buildings. 

“These funds have been 

critical in helping people 
stay in their homes,” he said. 
“And avoid foreclosure while 
helping Detroit, Flint and 
other cities across our state 
eliminate blight and revitalize 
neighborhoods.” 

Business professor 
recieves Golden 
Apple Award

Accounting Assistant Prof. 

Ryan Ball received the the Ross 
School of Business’ first Golden 
Apple Award, the University 
Record reports.

The Golden Apple Award 

is the only student selected 
teaching award on campus 
and is given out by Students 
Honoring Outstanding 
University Teaching. 

The award is given to 

undergraduate and graduate 
faculty who actively seek to 
encourage student engagement 
in the classroom. Students 
are able to nominate a faculty 
member of their choice. The 
nominees are later voted on by 
SHOUT. 

The award was inspired by 

Rabbi Eliezer ben Hurkanos 
who mentored students 
during his time here on how to 
organize their lives.

As this year’s winner, Ball 

will deliver the “Last Lecture.” 
The event encourages faculty 
to deliver a lecture as if it were 
their last in an effort to engage 
and inspire students.

Concealed gun 
permit applications 
see increase

Several counties across 

Michigan have reported 
increases in the number of 
applications for concealed 
gun licences, with significant 
increased in Macomb, Wayne 
and Oakland counties, the 
Detroit Free Press reports.

From March 1 to March 24, 

the number of concealed pistol 
licences increased by more than 
10,000 residents. In total, the 
state has 528,320 residents who 
are licensed to carry concealed 
weapons. 

The increasing trend began 

in December following a change 
in state law, which reduces the 
time it takes to receive a permit 
and removed three-member 
county boards which approved 
or denied the permits. 

County officials, gun shop 

owners and concealed pistol 
license instructors say the 
uncertainty during presidential 
election years also increase 
applications as people fear 
impending changes in policy

permits and are often targeted 
by 
government-sponsored 

repressive 
action 
and 

xenophobic stigma, making it 
difficult for those like Hassan 
to find work and assimilate.

“When I was given the 

privilege to go the United 
States, I just felt happy. I 
felt so excited,” Hassan said. 
“Because where I was living, 
life was quite hard.”

In the 2015 fiscal year, 

69,933 refugees out of a pool of 
more than 400,000 applicants 
were accepted for resettlement 
in the United States by the 
Department of State, with 
Burma, 
Iraq 
and 
Somalia 

the three largest countries 
of 
origin. 
Once 
approved, 

refugees are matched with 
one 
of 
nine 
national-level 

resettlement agencies, which 
then 
further 
divide 
the 

refugees among local affiliates 
like the JFS of Washtenaw. 
Beyond that, it’s up to the 
families, with some help from 
the local affiliates depending 
on local processes.

Having 
just 
arrived 
to 

Michigan 
in 
early 
March, 

Hassan said he and his family 
are 
still 
settling 
into 
to 

their new surroundings. He 

described many things — the 
colder 
climate, 
unfamiliar 

foods 
and 
reliable 
indoor 

plumbing 
— 
as 
unique 

challenges to adjust to, and 
said he is still reluctant to let 
his children play outside until 
he is more familiar with the 
neighborhood.

At JFS, when refugees arrive 

in the Ann Arbor area, they 
work with a case manager on a 
daily basis for the next 90 days. 
The overall goal, according 
to Nathaniel Smith, a JFS 
resettlement case manager, is 
to have them be self-sufficient 
by the end of that period.

“We 
address 
a 
lot 
of 

different areas of the refugees’ 
life, getting them set up with 
all the things that they need 
to start functioning on their 
own here,” Smith said. “For 
the most part, they are close 
to 
being 
financially 
self-

sufficient after 90 days.”

Originally founded in 1978 

to help resettle Jews fleeing 
the Soviet Union, JFS has 
worked with refugees fleeing 
numerous conflicts since then, 
including 
Kosovars 
fleeing 

the Balkan Wars in the 1990s, 
Somalis, Burmans, Afghans 
and Syrians.

JFS 
Executive 
Director 

Anya Abramazon said each new 
wave of refugees poses unique 
challenges. The most recent 

wave, she said, has largely been 
individuals fleeing conflict in 
the Middle East and elsewhere 
like Hassan, including large 
numbers of Iraqis who worked 
for the U.S. military.

“Few of (our earlier cases) 

came from an active combat 
situation where they were 
facing death and loss, so the 
level of trauma that we’re 
seeing is very high,” she said. 
“It takes time for people to 
figure out how to get out of 
that survival mode and just 
start living their life.”

Assistance 
during 
the 

90-day 
period 
currently 

includes help with registering 
for 
proper 
identification, 

school 
enrollment, 
initial 

medical 
screenings 
and 

employment services. Follow-
up English language training 
and career services are also 
available for up to five years 
after arrival.

With this wave, and in 

recent years in particular, 
Abramazon and Smith pointed 
to several newer challenges.

In 
particular, 
Ambrazon 

noted that the recent wave has 
required 
different 
services 

because many of the refugees 
JFS is currently working with 
are young children, who have 
seperate individual needs.

“Kids 
need 
support,” 

she said. “They need time 

to 
understand 
the 
new 

environment, and for them it’s 
not as much of a challenge as it 
is for their parents, but it’s still 
a challenge.”

Smith also said currently, 

high housing costs also present 
a 
challenge 
in 
resettling 

refugees in the Ann Arbor 
area.

“Some of the challenges 

that JFS faces when working 
in 
Washtenaw 
County 
are 

perhaps the same challenges 
that 
other 
residents 
of 

Washtenaw County face,” he 
said, adding that JFS has a 
partnership 
with 
McKinley 

Housing to help find affordable 
apartments. 
“Rentals 
can 

be somewhat expensive in 
this area and there’s often 
limited availability, especially 
when we get larger families 
arriving.”

However, both also noted 

that for many refugees, and for 
their agency, the community 
support 
they’ve 
found 
in 

Washtenaw has been key to 
successful resettlement. JFS 
relies in part on donations of 
money, food and furniture 
from 
local 
residents 
and 

Christian, Jewish and Islamic 
faith-based 
groups. 
They 

also have interns from the 
University of Michigan and 
Eastern Michigan University. 
Many of JFS’s broader services 

— such as a food bank and 
counseling — are now available 
to the whole community, not 
just refugees.

“They come here because 

of acceptance, because it’s a 
very welcoming community,” 
Abramazon said. “Nobody is 
puzzled here when they hear 
an accent.”

Speaking in the JFS offices 

in Ann Arbor, where Hassan 
has daily appointments, he 
said he is optimistic for his 
family’s 
future. 
Currently, 

his children are attending 
local schools. Hassan said he 
plans to find work and pursue 
higher education to further his 
career, and eventually become 
an entrepreneur.

“The first priority that I 

would like to give my family 
is (the opportunity) to go to 
school and learn,” Hassan 
said. “I want to become a great 
businessman … someone who is 
self-confident and can employ 
people.”

“S

top Islam”

“Trump 2016”
“Build the Wall”

These 
were 

the 
words 

chalked 
onto 

the 
middle 
of 

the 
Diag 
last 

Thursday, March 
31. 
Muslim 

students 
then 

spent 
hours 

cleaning 
the 

mess 
because 

of the lack of 
response 
from 

the University of 
Michigan’s Division of Public Safety 
and Security and the University’s 
administration.

I am sorry to say I am not 

surprised.

The fact that DPSS and the 

University failed to take immediate 
action to clean the words from 
the Diag, forcing Muslim students 
to clean up the words of hatred 
directed at them, is despicable. But 
it’s a good example of how things 
always go for Muslims and minority 
students on this campus. Though 
President Schlissel and spokesman 
Rick Fitzgerald released statements, 
the University does not put forth 
real effort to mend its relationships 
with different minority groups on 
campus, and it is the members of 
the groups themselves that have 
to create their own safe spaces. 
Islamophobia has been prevalent on 
campus throughout the years and 
statements without regular action is 
not enough.

This is not an isolated situation 

in terms of how the University 
treats Islamophobia or even how 
Islamophobia is treated in general. 
Last year when UMix — a University 
program that provides students with 
a space to enjoy alcohol-free Friday 
nights — planned a screening of 
“American Sniper,” several minority 
student 
groups 
and 
individuals 

petitioned to not have the movie 
screened. The UMix organizers 

accepted this change at first, but 
after pressure from the media and 
others who called the incident an 
infringement of freedom of speech, 
they decided to play the movie 
anyway. During that week, Muslim 
students 
were 
blamed 
for 
the 

incident from all sides, and instead 
of the University administration 
standing up for Muslim students, 
Fitzgerald stood by the decision to 
keep the movie running in UMix.

Muslim and Middle Eastern and 

North African students had to create 
their own safe spaces during this 
time and had no public support from 
the University. They were their own 
spokespersons, their own safety net, 
their own validation.

I bring this up because since 

that time, not much has changed. 
Fitzgerald’s statement on Thursday 
felt as if the University was enforcing 
the rhetoric of Muslims being against 
freedom yet again:

“Attacks directed toward any 

member 
or 
group 
within 
the 

University of Michigan community, 
based on a belief or characteristic, 
are inconsistent with our values of 
respect, civility and equality,” the 
statement read. “We all understand 
that where speech is free it will 
sometimes wound. But our message 
is this: We are fully committed to 
fostering an environment that is 
welcoming and inclusive of everyone. 
Tonight we are reminded there is 
much work yet to be done.”

I fail to see any substantial work on 

the part of the University to combat 
Islamophobia or listen to minority 
students on campus. The very nature 
of Fitzgerald’s statement implies 
that Muslim students are simply 
wounded by freedom of speech and 
to imply that hateful speech should 
be expected, is a remark that stems 
from the same ideas that Muslims 
face because of Islamophobia.

The students who washed the 

Diag kept the chalk with the words 
“Trump 2016” in respect of freedom 
of speech demonstrating how the 
students’ intentions were not to 

censor speech, but to work against 
hate speech. To say that there is 
work to be done without making 
substantial effort is hollow. Muslim 
and minority students are not 
treated as students deserving of the 
University’s concern.

Everything 
adds 
up. 
Jim 

Harbaugh was revered for a tweet 
about watching “American Sniper,” 
while Muslim students were seen 
as attackers of freedom of speech. 
A 
member 
of 
Central 
Student 

Government yelled in my face when 
the only indication of my identity was 
my headscarf. No one called it a bias 
incident. A University medical school 
professor posted an Islamophobic 
comment on one of my articles. I 
am expected to be used to this and 
to accept it because otherwise I am 
just another Muslim that cried hate 
speech being discarded as being 
anti-freedom of speech. Despite the 
fact that freedom of speech exists in 
America does not mean that hateful 
speech should be tolerated in such 
a way that the victim of hatred 
gets treated like the perpetrator. 
Hateful speech is never as painful as 
watching people react as if there is 
nothing wrong with it.

The path to progress is not 

through tolerating hateful speech, it 
is in recognizing it, just as it was in 
the past with anti-Semitic speech or 
blackface or any other forms of hate 
written by few but accepted by the 
masses.

Every day, I get closer and closer 

to believing I will never truly be 
seen as belonging to this University, 
or in America for that matter — my 
University of Michigan acceptance 
e-mail and the fact that I was born 
and raised in the state of Michigan 
still does not feel like enough.

I should not expect hateful speech.
I should not accept hateful speech.
I should not be expected to accept 

hateful speech.

No one should.

his 
Sexual 
Assault 

Awareness Month, I stand 
with survivors who are 

too often silenced by a culture that 
refuses to believe them.

I advocate for survivors who 

never told anyone, not even their best 
friend, their mom, their partner.

I believe survivors who stay silent 

because they feel what happened to 
them “doesn’t count.”

I 
support 
survivors 
who 

experienced 
coercion 
or 

manipulation and don’t think what 
happened to them “counts” as sexual 
assault.

I am here for the survivors who 

don’t tell anyone because they don’t 
want to hurt the perpetrator of their 
sexual assault, who may be a friend.

I fight for every single survivor 

because I refuse to accept that sexual 
assault impacts thousands of students 
on this campus — many of whom face 
the effects of their experience alone 
— yet only a handful ever see justice.

Silence is a tool of oppression. Our 

call to action is not to blame those 
who are silent; it is to identify and to 
change the culture and the systems 
that silence people. Survivors stay 
silent for many reasons, and these 
reasons often relate to their identities. 
Lesbian, gay, transgender, queer or 
gender non-conforming folks may 
stay silent for fear of being outed. Men 
may fear being asked, “Why didn’t 
you fight back?” Many people believe 
that sex workers cannot be sexually 
assaulted because their services are 
being paid for. Trans women of color 
face overwhelming violence and the 
confluence of risk factors that make 
it incredibly difficult to speak up and 
find help. Religiously conservative 
groups may feel silenced due to the 
stigmatization of sexuality. Women 
are treated as if they are responsible 
— questioned about what they were 
wearing, what they were drinking 
or what they’ve done in the past. 
Undocumented 
immigrants 
may 

experience human trafficking or 
fear sharing their story due to fear of 
deportation.

When the odds are stacked against 

anyone so unfairly, it is no wonder 
they stay silent.

According to the 2015 Campus 

Climate 
Survey 
on 
Sexual 

Misconduct, 11.4 percent of all 
students, 
undergraduate 
and 

graduate, 
experienced 
sexual 

assault in the year preceding the 
survey. 
More 
than 
22 
percent 

of 
undergraduate 
females 
were 

assaulted in a year. 

Shockingly, more than half of 

those survivors reported telling no 
one about what happened to them. 
That means in the year preceding 
the survey, about 2,600 survivors 
never talked to anyone at the Sexual 
Assault Prevention and Awareness 
Center, at the University of Michigan 
or in law enforcement. They never 
even told their story to their best 
friend.

While I recognize that these 

numbers are not necessarily accurate 
due to survey limitations, and raw 
numbers are always inadequate 
to measure the full costs of sexual 
assault, that number is simply too 
high to accept. Any number of 
students who are violated so deeply 
is completely unacceptable. Further, 
those rates only measure sexual 
assault and not the other forms of 
sexualized violence that impact 
college students like intimate partner 
violence and stalking.

On campus, there are many places 

for survivors to go — SAPAC is an 
excellent confidential resource for 
all survivors. The primary place 
to seek non-confidential help from 
the administration is the Office for 
Institutional Equity, which is meant 
to address Title IX violations. Title IX 
prevents sex-based discrimination 
in education, and since sexual 
harassment 
and 
sexual 
assault 

inhibit a student’s ability to learn in 
an equitable environment, it is the 
University’s legal responsibility to 
address sexual violence on campus.

In 
January, 
the 
University 

released its Fiscal Year 2015 report 
on Office for Institutional Equity 
investigations under the Student 
Sexual Misconduct Policy. Despite 
the fact that nearly 5,000 students 
experience sexual assault in a year 
alone, just 97 incidents were reported 
to the University.

The subsequent 25 investigations 

found 
seven 
perpetrators 

“responsible.” You read that right — 
last year, the University only found 
seven 
perpetrators 
responsible 

for 
sexual 
assault. 
With 
the 

preponderance of sexual assault 
on campus, it is unbelievable to me 

that only seven perpetrators will see 
some form of academic discipline 
for creating an intolerable campus 
environment. It speaks to both a 
campus culture that discourages 
survivors from coming forward 
and to the failure of the sexual 
misconduct policy to adequately 
address the incidents that are 
reported. Our University’s system 
fails survivors, and our culture fails 
survivors when it silences them.

Action is whatever you want 

it to be — there is no right way to 
feel, no right way to act, no right 
way to share. But in the spirit of 
transforming silence to action, 
here are a few ideas. Request an 
educational workshop from our 
Peer 
Educators 
or 
Bystander 

Intervention 
and 
Community 

Engagement 
programs. 
Engage 

with survivors in your community 
by hosting a confidential survivor 
speakout. Attend a SAPAC event 
or collaborate to host one in your 
community. Contact your elected 
representatives in the Michigan 
legislature and in Congress to 
ask about what they are doing to 
end sexual assault on campuses. 
Contact the University’s Board 
of Regents to tell them that you 
demand action from our campus 
administration on sexual assault in 
our community. Read the Student 
Sexual Misconduct Policy and 
educate yourself on the changes 
that will go into effect on July 1. Go 
through ally training or volunteer 
training 
with 
SAPAC. 
Most 

important of all, start conversations 
in your community. Bring up the 
subject with your friends. Support 
survivors by saying, “I believe you,” 
“It’s not your fault” and “There’s 
no right way to heal.” Be kind and 
empathetic. Take care of yourself 
while talking about these important 
but heavy issues.

The campus climate survey found 

that 37 percent of survivors who did 
not report did not do so because 
they didn’t think anything would 
be done about it. Let’s prove to 
them that we will believe them 
and that something will be done.

W

atching 
our 
current 
political 

circus is no longer amusing. The 
corrupting forces pulling us toward 

accepting the xenophobic 
tendencies that have long 
disrupted human progress 
— see our treatment of 
Native Americans, Chinese 
Americans 
or 
Irish 

Americans, among others — 
are becoming terrifyingly 
omnipresent. 
It 
seemed 

that after many twists and 
turns, we finally learned 
to be better than our fears, 
that 
we 
had 
accepted, 

however grudgingly (for 
some), the importance of 
bringing outsiders into our classrooms, our 
lives and our country.

Though some discomfort around new people 

and ideas is expected and normal, there are 
ways to combat this that do not devolve into 
exclusionary, and now oftentimes blatantly 
racist, language. We must condemn such 
language for what it is: Bigotry that alienates 
citizens at home and whole groups of people 
around the world.

In recent months, the flagrant disregard 

for our country’s founding ideals from the 
leading Republican candidates has created a 
toxic environment that not only ostracizes our 
friends and neighbors, but also endangers our 
values more so than any threat coming from 
abroad. Without a strong rebuke from those of 
us yet to be targeted, we risk endangering the 
very pluralism that many Americans have long 
taken for granted.

The unfortunate fact remains that this 

bigotry radiates from both of the leading 
Republican presidential candidates. It is not 
unreasonable to surmise that these derogatory 
statements, whether they be directed at women, 
Mexicans, Muslims or more recently anyone 
who protests at a Trump rally — especially if 
they are not white — signify a deep-seated fear 
among many Americans that they are in danger 
of losing out on their American Dream.

The idealist in me wants to think that many 

Americans are being manipulated by a well-
staged campaign playing on their deepest 
fear: Fear itself. I want to believe that upon 
reasoning their way through these illogical 

and often unapologetically racist arguments, 
Americans will find them both logically flawed 
and morally reprehensible.

This is exactly what I thought upon hearing 

that, apparently, most Mexicans in this country 
are rapists and murders (with some good 
people among them, of course). But instead 
of falling to the wayside after the initial 
shock that these statements sent through our 
collective discourse, proponents (a group that 
is unfortunately growing) have only further 
hardened their resolve to alienate groups 
who do not share their nationality, religion 
or ignorance. These statements have yet to 
dissuade potential voters and many in the 
Republican political establishment who have 
yet to disqualify offenders for their remarks 
outright.

My inner cynic is now leaning toward 

another explanation for our current political 
environment. Instead of living in a nation 
that welcomes diversity and attracts the best 
and brightest from all over the world, instead 
of living in a nation devoted to the pluralism 
inherent to our founding ideals, instead of 
living in a nation that provides a source of 
hope and opportunity to people living all 
around the world, we are living in a nation 
of parasitic opportunists who — while happy 
to extend a welcoming hand to further their 
goals — are now trying to desperately grasp 
at a malformed ideal of days gone by to save 
a way of life built on the back of inequity and 
discrimination.

I desperately hope that my inner cynic is 

wrong and that we use this impasse as an 
opportunity to move forward: to take another 
small step toward overcoming the xenophobic 
tendencies of our past by rejecting bigotry at 
the ballot box. To stand together in a “purple 
coalition” that overwhelms what separates 
red from blue, Republican from Democrat. As 
a silent majority of Americans on both sides 
of the aisle that has for too long watched with 
bemused detachment, we must now raise our 
voices and let the world know that we will not 
rationalize racism. We will not resign ourselves 
to the persistent bigoted contortions that aim 
to divide us. We will instead come together to 
prove, once and for all, that love trumps hate.

Love trumps hate

DANNY
SACK

On the evening of Tuesday, March 29:

“#StopIslam” and “Stop the Rape of Europe” 

were chalked in the Diag, targeting Muslim 
identities at the University of Michigan. This 
incident was not singular, but joined a suc-
cession of other Islamophobic instances that 
continue to marginalize and create a hostile 
environment for Muslim students on campus. In 
the last three years, Muslim students have faced 
multiple attacks on their identity and safety:

When Students Allied for Freedom and 

Equality launched the #UMDivest movement 
and proposed a resolution to create a committee 
to investigate investments that allegedly facili-
tate the violation of Palestinian human rights, 
members of SAFE as well as their allies faced 
verbal attacks on social media and in person, 
and were unable to attend class without Depart-
ment of Public Safety and Security escorts.

After a widely supported letter was written 

to the Center for Campus Involvement request-
ing the cancellation of an “American Sniper” 
screening, the University of Michigan tempo-
rarily canceled the screening of the film. Though 
many organizations representing non-Arab and 
non-Muslim students endorsed the letter, this 
proposition led to a disproportionate number of 
verbal, physical and social media attacks on stu-
dents with Muslim and Arab backgrounds.
When is enough?

Time and time again, Muslim students have 

found the administration absent when its sup-
port was needed most. Muslim students feel 
unsafe, unwelcome and unheard in a space 
that is meant to be inclusive of all identities. 
In response to the Diag incident, University 
President Mark Schlissel released a statement 
emphasizing the importance of education and 
community-building, but has yet to provide 
actionable steps or key resources to address 
these issues.

We recognize the importance of free speech, 

but it is crucial to examine how our actions 
impact the ability of our fellow community mem-
bers to have equal access to education. With the 
glacial pace of the administration to ensure the 
safety of its students, it is our responsibility to 
create an inclusive and welcoming atmosphere 
for our peers. It is unquestionable that differing 
perspectives create mutual understanding and a 
more holistic view of the world. However, abus-
ing this right to free speech to espouse hatred is 
not an ideal anyone should aspire to.

As student leaders on this campus, we believe 

it is imperative to not only voice our solidarity 
with the Muslim community, but also to firmly 
oppose any attacks on one’s religion, race or eth-
nicity. To those who believe in spreading hate: 
We do not support you. This campus does not 
support you.

We will not sit passively as students face bla-

tant discrimination in a community we are all 
meant to call home. And we are calling on the 
administration to do the same. Our adminis-
tration needs to publicly announce visible and 
proactive measures to ensure the Muslim com-
munity feels supported and valued on this cam-
pus.
To our fellow Wolverines:

We cannot distance ourselves from this issue. 

When any marginalized group on our campus 
feels unsafe, we all suffer. We lose the value of 
our institution when our university’s reputation 
is tarnished with such blatant discrimination. 
We lose the incredible curiosity, brilliance and 
light that these students bring to our campus. 
We lose the spirit of Michigan, as the commu-
nity we love and cherish becomes biased and 
selective.

We, as student leaders of the University of 

Michigan, call upon our peers to defend our 
campus against acts that propagate discrimina-
tion. As a student body, we must let the world 
know that we will not tolerate hate and hostility 
shrouded in the rhetoric of free speech. As the 
leaders and the best, we must unite.
To the Muslim community on campus:

We support you. And we thank you for con-

tinuing to show your strength as others expose 
their weaknesses. In this country, we enjoy the 
liberty to believe and practice whatever creed 
we wish. This freedom extends to people of all 
faith traditions. We repudiate the discrimina-
tive messages that have been cast, and it is your 
right to freely be as you are. And those who 
oppose your free exercise of belief oppose us as 
well. We are one. This University is hoMe to all 
of us.

Weezer continues its 
comeback on ‘White’

By SAM ROSENBERG

Daily Arts Writer

By now, you’d think that a ’90s 

band like Weezer would have 
given up already. The Los Ange-
les based rock 
group attained 
paramount suc-
cess from their 
magnetic Blue 
Album 
debut 

and their ini-
tially 
hated, 

now 
critically 

praised sopho-
more 
record 

Pinkerton 
in 

1994 and 1996, 
respectively. But even when their 
stardom grew with radio hits like 
“Island in the Sun” and “Beverly 
Hills,” the angsty coolness that 
they so effectively embodied was 
gradually disappearing. In the 
2000s, Weezer released a string 
of lukewarm power-pop records 
like 2005’s head-scratching Make 
Believe and 2009’s severely mis-
guided Raditude (yes, the one 
with a song that featured Lil 
Wayne). However, starting with 
2014’s refreshing Everything Will 
Be Alright in the End, their best 
record in years, Weezer is steadily 
making up for lost time and right-
fully so. Their sound, complete 
with sawtoothed guitar plucks, 
crisp drums, culturally relevant 
lyrics and lead vocalist Rivers 
Cuomo’s croon, is now even more 
finely tuned than before on their 
tenth record and fourth self-titled 

record Weezer (White Album).

While White Album still lacks 

some punch, it’s leaner, looser, 
happier and more mature than 
Weezer’s last few records. Like 
each of the previous Weezer self-
titled 
albums, 
White 
Album’s 

“color” backdrop represents the 
overall tone of the record. It’s 
about rebirth, purity and, to put 
it more concretely, it’s about their 
hometown of L.A. (mine as well) 
and the album uses the beach 
as its motif setting. Other than 
the sound of seagulls and waves 
crashing onto the shore in the 
album opener “California Kids,” 
you can really visualize the kind of 
peculiarities and strange beauties 
entrenched in the city of Los Ange-
les from Cuomo’s perspective.

By deriving its xylophone open-

ing notes from Pinkerton’s “Pink 
Triangle,” “California Kids” pos-
sesses both a nostalgic feel and 
yearning for the present. That 
theme continues in “Wind in Our 
Sail” and “(Girl) We Got a Thing,” 
two energetic romantic ballads 
that name-check Charles Darwin, 
Sisyphus, Gregor Mendel, Stock-
holm syndrome and the Hare 
Krishna. With the hilarious, pow-
er-rock anthem “Thank God for 
Girls,” Weezer succeeds not only 
because of the song’s bizarre nar-
rative, but also for its progressive, 
feminist overtones (“She’s so big / 
She’s so strong / She’s so energetic 
in her sweaty overalls”). The simi-
larly sharp “L.A. Girlz” plays with 
gender stereotypes, with Cuomo 
making himself into a desperate 

guy begging his crush to “sweeten 
up” and acknowledge his feelings 
for her.

Despite all the hard rock jingles 

and odes to women and cannolis, 
Weezer also infuses some of their 
trepidation and Pinkerton malaise 
into “Do You Wanna Get High?” 
which deals with Cuomo’s pre-
scription drug addiction and the 
relationship with his girlfriend 
around the time of 2001’s Green 
Album. Described by Cuomo as 
a “really yucky and intention-
ally uncomfortable portrayal” of 
an addict’s life, “Do You Wanna 
Get High?” is as drugged-out and 
depressing as you’d imagine, but 
Cuomo transforms it into a mind-
numbing throwback. The mostly 
acoustic closer “Endless Bummer” 
is when White Album really shines, 
with Cuomo anxiously awaiting 
the end of the summer during the 
song’s climactic breakdown end-
ing. 

Everything Will Be Alright in 

the End was a return to form for 
Weezer, and White Album is a 
strong continuation of that return. 
Because 
Weezer 
has 
already 

ingrained such an impactful cul-
tural legacy in pop and rock music, 
they don’t need to make a criti-
cally acclaimed record (though, 
that would be pretty nice). The 
only potential issue here is if they 
continue to tread on familiar mate-
rial without breaking new ground. 
Luckily, White Album has indi-
cated that Weezer is on the right 
track to maintaining their awe-
someness.

FILM REVIEW
Romanian ‘Aferim!’ 
a deft western satire

By DANIEL HENSEL

Daily Arts Writer

The Western is a curious type of 

film. The genre features plotlines 
that often feel limited to a short list 
of possible con-
flicts drawn up 
by the genre’s 
masters of yes-
teryear. 
Even 

from a purely 
geographic and 
temporal stand-
point, most of 
its films occur 
in one specific sliver of space and 
time. Whenever a film enters the 
Western canon that attempts to 
fundamentally rethink the genre, 
it’s important to take note. Fred 
Zinnemann’s “High Noon” made 
the Western intimate and small. 
Joel and Ethan Coen’s “Fargo” 
made the Western wintry, Minne-
sotan and modern.

Now, Radu Jude (“Everybody in 

Our Family”) has made the West-
ern Romanian. His film “Aferim!” 
borrows from the greats of the 
1940s and 1950s, and yet it feels 
especially new. “Aferim!”, which 
roughly means “bravo!” or “well 
done!” in Romanian, follows a 
policeman and his son in 1833 
Wallachia, Romania. The pair are 
hired by the local feudal lord to 
find a Roma slave named Carfin 
(Toma Cuzin, “The Treasure”), 
who ran away from the lord after 

sleeping with his wife. Along the 
way, the policeman, Costandin 
(Teodor Corban, “4 Months, 3 
Weeks and 2 Days”), gives ques-
tionable guidance to his teenage 
son, Ionita (Mihai Comanoiu, a 
newcomer) and begins to befriend 
Carfin as he divulges his sexual 
history with the lord’s wife.

Shot in a beautiful black and 

white, 
the 
film’s 
Romanian 

landscapes are stunning. Jude 
constructs his shots carefully, 
establishing 
the 
mountainous 

background as if it, too, were one 
of our main characters. Jude also 
has a knack for framing, whether 
in the lord’s chambers or at an out-
door carnival. In both intimate and 
large-scale scenes, he can immedi-
ately establish a textured setting 
with a deftness that usually takes 
years of experience to master.

The film is a Western, but to 

limit it to that genre would be 
inaccurate. “Aferim!” doubles as a 
biting and hilarious political sat-
ire, showcasing the absurdity of 
historical discriminatory policies 
in Romania. That country’s his-
tory of Roma slavery is a subject 
rarely addressed in its nation’s film 
industry, and for its first major 
movie on the topic, comedy was a 
brave decision. But Jude had the 
right idea. Often, it’s comedy that 
can force us to confront the most 
pressing and taboo subjects of 
our histories. It’s the film’s writ-
ing that takes center stage — the 

Coens or Quentin Tarantino must 
have served as a particular inspi-
ration, with pointless vitriolic ban-
ter being its main comedic feature 
– but it’s easy to feel like some of 
the jokes were lost in translation. 
Of course, no subtitle could ever 
match the vocal intonation and 
timing required to land a perfect 
joke. But here, they come pretty 
close.

However, at its violent sections 

and when generally addressing 
the prevalence of Roma slavery 
in Romania at the time, “Aferim!” 
becomes somber. That dour tone 
is integral to addressing the story 
with the gravitas needed to con-
front such a tragedy. The legacy 
of slavery in Romania is very dif-
ferent from the American per-
spective. Jude, by necessity, must 
approach it carefully.

Yet, the film focuses on Costan-

din who, as a very vulgar and con-
tradictory individual, is a tough 
sell as a protagonist. In the same 
sentence, he can pay deference to 
his lord and denigrate the neigh-
boring lands (Turkey is a common 
target), yet decry the lousy state 
of Romania. He’s the least lik-
able character in the film (except 
for, perhaps, the feudal lord and 
an incredibly racist priest), as he 
tastelessly disparages everyone 
he meets. And yet, with humor as 
our aid, we see him transform. The 
comedy may end on a bitter note, 
but Costandin is bitter with us.

Aferim!

Parada Film

Michigan Theater.

I 

think about Will Gardner 
a lot. Since the character’s 
death on “The Good Wife” 

two years ago, Will (played by 
Josh Charles) probably crosses 
my mind 
unbidden 
at least 
once a day. 
It’s always 
something 
stupid or 
small that 
reminds 
me of him, 
like the way 
somebody 
pronounces 
“Chicago” or the way the 
newsroom felt when I’d stay 
late at work, the fluorescent 
lights glowing dim yellow and 
the office quiet except for the 
breaths of a few hardworking 
insomniacs. I can recite lines of 
Will’s dialogue like they’re lyr-
ics to my favorite song; I can’t 
step into an elevator without 
remembering the way his hand 
clasps with Alicia’s when the 
doors close and they’re alone 
and unseen. These memories 
feel like my own — and when 
Will was shot to death in court 
in season five, the grief that his 
friends and co-workers experi-
enced felt like mine, too.

I could barely finish “Wet 

Hot American Summer: First 
Day of Camp” because it was 
so weird to see Josh Charles 
wearing a sky-blue polo shirt 
instead of a blood-stained 
gray suit, to see him smiling 
and laughing instead of lying 
motionless on the courtroom 
floor. I miss him viscerally. 
Even two seasons after the 
fact, my throat closes up when 
someone mentions his name on 
a new episode. I watch old clips 
from season one just to hear 
his voice. I read episode recaps 
from five years ago so I can 
remember what he argued in 
the case that week and what he 
said to Alicia after. And more 
often than I’d like to admit, 
I rewatch mopey fan videos 
on YouTube and weep openly 
about that big, bursting heart 
that isn’t beating anymore.

“The Good Wife” just 

doesn’t feel the same without 
him. Though I’d count it as 
one of my favorite shows (any-
one who has ever spent five 
minutes with me can attest 
that I will never fucking shut 
up about “The Good Wife”), 
watching new episodes is a 
chore. Objectively, the show 
has gone downhill with its 
reliably lazy writing and unin-
spired plotting. It’s a shame, 
really. There are only four 
episodes left this season, and 
I can barely get any joy from 
seeing Alicia Florrick chas-
ing her dreams of a female-led 
law firm and giving a hand job 
to Jeffrey Dean Morgan in a 
crowded restaurant.

It’s not just me. The “Good 

Wife” Twitter-verse laments 
the days when this show was 
one of the best on TV, rivaling 
“Breaking Bad” for the most 
thrilling episodes of the year, 
and the simple act of pushing 
papers off a desk could make 
professional pop culture jour-
nalists lose their shit. “The 
Good Wife” ’s weekly recapper 
on The A.V. Club (and former 

Michigan Daily TV columnist) 
Kayla Kumari Upadhyaya 
noted in a recent review that 
“ ‘The Good Wife’ is going out 
at its most mediocre, its most 
bland,” and I’d have to agree. 
When is the last time some-
body did something really sur-
prising, something that landed 
as emotionally grounded? 
Drama, or at least “The Good 
Wife” ’s version of it, comes 
from characters, history and 
bursts of feeling bubbling out 
from behind poised, lawyer-
like exteriors. “The Good 
Wife” has been completely 
devoid of this since Jeffrey 
Grant grabbed a guard’s gun in 
season five.

“The Good Wife” ’s great-

ness died on the courtroom 
floor with Will Gardner. It 
was hard to recognize when he 
was still alive, but Will really 
was unlike anyone else on that 
show. Where Alicia, Diane and 
Cary are pragmatic and gov-
erned by their logical, politi-
cally cognizant brains, Will 
had an atom bomb of a heart 
that he couldn’t always control. 
His feelings buried themselves 
deep — he’d crushed on Alicia 
since their law school days, 
feelings he carried with him 
for 20 years and moves across 
the country until she was back 
in on the job market with a 
wounded marriage and looking 
for some help. He wasn’t very 
good at hiding it — which made 
seasons one and two’s stolen 
kisses and impulsive declara-
tions of love so electric. He had 
passion to spare, enough to 
kick-start nearly every serial 
storyline in the first few sea-
sons. The musical chairs of the 
name partner switch ups, Ali-
cia’s climbing of the corporate 
ladder, the gaining and losing 
of big clients and major cases, 
the spark that ignite Alicia’s 
romance and push her further 
from her husband Peter — it all 
traces back to Will and his big 
mouth and his giant, fragile 
heart.

The best “Good Wife” drama 

married the firm’s politics 
with the characters’ tangled 
relationships, and no stretch 
of episodes nailed it more than 
season five. After almost 100 
episodes of carefully laid char-
acter moments, we knew that 
Will valued justice and loyalty 
above all. Season five’s “Hit-
ting the Fan” is a series high-
light, bringing unparalleled, 
delicious dramatic tension. 
When Alicia betrays Will to 
start her own firm with Cary 
(and take some of the clients 
they’d earned for Will and 
Diane’s firm), Will’s passion 
finally boils over. He clears 
everything off the traitorous 
Alicia’s desk with one furi-
ous swoop of an arm. His eyes 
look wide and crazed, burn-

ing with hurt and wildness 
and self-hatred for everything 
he’s about to say and can’t 
hold back. “I took you in. No 
one wanted you. I hired you. 
I pushed for you. God. God, 
you’re awful, and you don’t 
even know how awful you 
are.” With Alicia’s stony glare 
returning Will’s burst of fire, 
it’s clear nothing will ever be 
the same.

And it wasn’t. After that 

episode, Will lost his better 
judgment which he went face 
to face with Alicia in court. 
He couldn’t choke his feelings 
down, and Alicia wounded 
him further; she knew he was 
a sentimental type and would 
remember the shell-pink suit 
she wore the time they made 
out in the elevator. She wore 
it to court, and with each 
subsequent episode, his heart 
stretched wider and thinner — 
until there was nothing else for 
him to do but take a bullet or 
a dozen to that delicate chest 
and go out in a blaze of dramat-
ics. The episode where he died, 
“Dramatics, Your Honor,” was 
the highest peak “The Good 
Wife” would ever reach, and 
the show should have ended 
there.

Of course, it didn’t. It’s been 

two years and one month since 
Will left in a body bag, but the 
show is still ticking. Alicia is 
haunted by the happiness she 
could have seized with Will, 
those lost years of passion 
when she stayed buttoned up, 
kept her heart in its cage and 
pushed Will to think practi-
cally. Four episodes from series 
end, she’s now letting loose a 
little more, starting an affair 
with her employee and finally 
asking for a divorce from flop 
husband Peter. But it feels inor-
ganic, because we know this 
just doesn’t fit with the Alicia 
we know. Will Gardner was 
the wild one, the tactless and 
passionate who made mistakes 
and thought and spoke with his 
heart first. He got mad, he got 
hurt and he was the catalyst 
for drama — both in his per-
sonal life and for “The Good 
Wife” ’s greater plot. Alicia’s 
new lover (and probable end 
game dude) Jason Crouse is 
handsome and nice enough, but 
he’s bland as a saltine cracker 
and is missing that uninhibited 
soul that made Will Gardner so 
compelling.

Since this is my penultimate 

column, I’ll inevitably graduate 
and burn out before “The Good 
Wife” ends in May. Somebody 
else will review the finale, and 
they’ll probably do a great job 
and avoid talking about sup-
porting characters that died 
two seasons ago. But if I could 
make one last passionate plea 
to Robert and Michelle King, 
the creators of my favorite 
show, I’d say: Please, please, 
please don’t forget about Will 
Gardner. It might be too late to 
bring him back from the dead, 
but it’s not too late to start 
some fights, some fires and 
reignite that classic “The Good 
Wife” drama.

TV REVIEW
Laugh track goes 
West, mostly fails

Netflix’s “The 
Ranch” is just a 

basic sitcom 

By SAM ROSENBERG

Daily Arts Writer

There’s a certain artifice about 

laugh tracks in traditional, multi-
camera sitcoms. The laugh track 
can be an over-
used, frequently 
unnecessary 
aural element on 
TV that strives to 
elevate a show’s 
humor 
but 

instead becomes 
too 
distracting 

for its own good. 
CBS’s 
“Mom” 

and NBC’s “The Carmichael 
Show” are currently some of the 
only TV comedies with a laugh 
track that manage to subvert 
traditional sitcom standards by 
incorporating socially conscious 
themes and emotionally involved 
characters into their plots. Netf-
lix’s newest sitcom “The Ranch” 
has the potential to do the same, 
but it first needs to learn how to 
escape the dreadful quality of the 
laugh track. And then some.

Balancing on a tricky tight-

rope between ribald comedy and 
melodrama, “The Ranch” centers 
around the dysfunctional Ben-
nett family. Considering its con-
servative undertones, you might 
expect “The Ranch” to take place 
somewhere in the South, but the 
show is surprisingly set in the 
swing state of Colorado. Regard-
less, everything about the show 
screams red state values, from the 
country-themed opening credits 

to the good ol’ American town 
backdrop. Ashton Kutcher (“Two 
and a Half Men”) and Danny Mas-
terson (“Men at Work”) reunite 
from their “That ’70s Show” glory 
days as the two dysfunctional 
Bennett brothers — swagger-
ing Colt and sarcastic Jameson 
“Rooster,” respectively. After six 
years apart from his stern father 
Beau (the stellar Sam Elliott, 
“The Big Lebowski”), Colt returns 
home to make amends while try-
ing out for the local football team. 
Colt’s endearing mom Maggie 
(Debra Winger, “Rachel Getting 
Married”) also comes back into 
the family picture after Colt pre-
sumed her and Beau to be separat-
ed, but that they are in fact seeing 
each other again. 

While most of “The Ranch” 

’s humor is crass and childish 
— there’s a recurring pee joke 
and jab at Ugg boots in the first 
episode “Back Where I Come 
From” — there are a few instanc-
es of witty dialogue, especially 
when it involves a cuss word or 
two. “The Ranch” benefits from 
allowing its characters to curse, 
a factor that obviously wouldn’t 
work in the sanitized confines 
of network and standard cable 
censorship. Because Netflix is a 
great platform to showcase TV 
programs with explicit content, 
“The Ranch” has the opportunity 
to be a raunchy family sitcom à la 
HBO’s short-lived “Lucky Louie.” 
Yet it still suffers from the strains 
of ordinary sitcom tropes, even 
with sitcom veterans Kutcher 
and Masterson at the helm of the 
show’s acting and executive pro-
ducing. They don’t make nearly as 
much of an effort as Elliott, whose 
charismatic 
Southern 
drawl, 

bushy mustache and strong emo-
tional range are enough to make 
him stand out. In addition to the 
show’s god-awful laugh track, the 
comic timing of almost everyone, 
except Elliott, is way off, with 
each character spewing rote joke 
set ups and predictable punchline 
after punchline. The only hilari-
ously down to earth line in “Back 
Where I Came From” comes dur-
ing a nice scene between the Ben-
netts during a rainstorm in the 
end of the episode, when Maggie 
utters, “You know, if someone 
took a picture of us, you’d never 
know how fucked up we really 
were.”

Even with the comedic quali-

ties dragging the show down, 
“The Ranch” could be a mild suc-
cess if it continues to highlight 
the faults of its characters and 
the family tensions that reside 
underneath the surface. Unlike a 
lot of Kutcher’s previous sitcom 
characters, his role as Colt feels 
more mature, with the character 
occasionally making dumb deci-
sions but also taking responsibil-
ity for his actions. Despite being 
in his 30s and having gone to 
Florida State University to play as 
a backup quarterback, Colt isn’t 
back in Colorado just to try out for 
football, but to regain a trusting 
bond with Beau. If it weren’t for 
the talent of Kutcher, Masterson, 
Winger or Elliott, “The Ranch” 
would also have trouble finding 
some form of dramatic depth and 
seriousness.

Like Colt, “The Ranch” still has 

some growing up to do. But with 
the right tools and mindset, the 
show has the ability to come back 
from its mistakes and find a way to 
make things right again.

The 
Ranch

Series Premiere

Netflix

By MARIA ROBINS-SOMER-

VILLE

Daily Arts Writer

The United States currently 

incarcerates 2.2 million people, 
a number that has increased 
fivefold in the 
past thirty 
years. There 
are currently 
40,000 indi-
viduals incar-
cerated in the 
state of Mich-
igan. In con-
junction with 
a series of 
lectures, art 
exhibitions 
and other 
events hap-
pening locally 
this spring 
through the 
Humanize 
the Numbers project, the Uni-
versity’s Prison Creative Arts 
Program’s annual Exhibition 
of Art by Michigan Prisoners 
sheds light on the experience 
of being incarcerated and the 
ways in which humanity can be 
restored in the face of a system 
highly based on punishment.

In working with the PCAP 

over the past two decades, Art 
Prof. Janie Paul has helped to 
give a creative voice to such 
populations often silenced by 
a life behind bars. She founded 
the PCAP Art Show with her 
husband Buzz Alexander in 
1996.

Paul said her observation of 

the injustice in the country’s 
system of incarceration, cou-
pled with her experience and 
identity as a visual artist led to 
her involvement with PCAP.

“It turned out the first year 

that it was so compelling that 
we made it an annual event,” 
Paul said.

She collaborated with cura-

tors Sari Adelson and Charlie 
Michaels, a project coordinator 
in the Stamps School of Art & 
Design, Adelson said the cura-
torial timeline for the project is 
exhaustive.

“The very first step is that 

we have to get approval from 
the Department of Correc-
tions,” Adelson said. “And once 
we get that we send out a letter 
to all of the people who were 
in the show the year before, 
letting them know the show 
is going happen, letting them 
know what the theme is going 
to be ... (then) we contact the 
special activities director at 
each of the facilities to set up 
a date and time for us to physi-
cally come and visit and meet 
with the men or women to see 
their work and then make our 
decisions.” 

“The artwork then goes 

through a process of being pho-
tographed and matted and then 
installed,” Paul added.

Adelson highlighted a piece 

called Cerca Trova, a large, col-
orful and detailed watercolor 
by a prisoner of something 
the inmate calls “Little Rik’s 
World.” Amid the chaotic nar-
rative scenes of his artwork, he 
always paints himself, “Little 
Rik,” a small boy with a beret 
and a magenta crayon, into his 
pieces.

“He’s telling a really in-

depth story. He uses a lot of 
his personal history and also 
cryptographs and linguistics,” 
Adelson said.

“His work is happy, it’s 

humorous. It’s also sad. It’s 
cynical. It’s political,” she con-
tinued. Amid the hundreds of 
signs, buildings, humans, ani-
mals and other creations Rik 
has included, Adelson added 
that Rik even painted a cartoon 
of her into the painting. 

Although the process starts 

months before the show opens, 
the curators make the visits to 
30 prisons included in the proj-
ect during January and Febru-
ary, which Paul noted was also 
challenging. 

The group makes on average 

two trips to the facilities each 
week during the winter, with 
some trips to farther parts of 
the state taking a whole week-
end. The curators also collect 
art from prisons in the Upper 

Peninsula, a trip that can take 
four or five days.

“What’s challenging is that 

you know that, especially in 
the prisons that are further 
away from Ann Arbor that 
aren’t getting a lot of regular 
programming from us. A lot 
of these artists have waited 
an entire year to have this 
one five-to-ten minute 
conversation with you and 
you can feel that and I’m 
really aware of that going in,” 
Michaels said.

Although visiting up to three 

or four facilities in a single day 
can be emotionally draining, 
Paul said is also “exhilarating 
and inspiring.”

He pointed to a particularly 

impressive piece done by art-
ist Samantha Bachynski of an 
anatomically correct, life-sized 
crocheted skeleton. He says 
that Bachynski wasn’t allowed 
to have it fully assembled in 
her cell and waited until all the 
pieces were completed to put 
the whole sculpture together. 
When he visited her, she 
showed him 50 pages of hand-
written diagrams.

The curators emphasized 

that face-to-face interaction 
with the artists is important, 
noting that it’s the first year 
that all of the prisons have 
allowed them to meet individu-
ally and in groups with all of 
the 420 artists in person, as 
opposed to simply collecting 
the art. 

Although many of the pieces 

in the exhibition reflect years 
of experience, most of the 
artists have never received 
formal training. In many of 
the facilities, though, cura-
tors said there is a culture of 
people educating each other 
and working within the lim-
ited scope of what’s available 
inside. One man writes letters 
to his mother to send him pic-
tures of kitchen sinks or house-
hold objects he wants to paint. 
Another, D’Artagnan Little, 
created sculptures of presi-
dents using only toilet paper, 
soap and pigments lifted from 
magazine pages.

“A lot of people will say 

that they loved art when they 
were a kid,” Paul said. “They 
loved to draw but it never went 
anywhere. They didn’t get the 
classes; they didn’t get the sup-
port.”

The exhibit tries to incor-

porate the artists as much as 
possible. The art is for sale, 
and the artists name their 
own prices. Aside from the 21 
percent tax on the pieces, all 
proceeds go directly back to 
the artists. In addition, the art-
ists designate a family member 
or friend to receive the art for 
them if it doesn’t sell.

Additionally, the exhibit 

includes a guestbook for visi-
tors to sign, leaving notes or 
feedback on the art. The entire 
book is then copied and sent to 
the artists.

“The project goes on all year 

round because it’s very impor-
tant for us to be including the 
artists in many ways since they 
can’t be here,” Paul said. “After 
the show is finished we make 
a video in which we include 
every piece in the show. This 
video includes shots of the 
reception and is sent to each 
prison where it is shown over 
closed-circuit TV.” 

Paul said one of his favorite 

pieces was a self-portrait titled 
“Orange Nation” by R. DeJe-
sus, a man serving 60 to 100 
years for distribution of crack 
cocaine and having trouble 
getting a lawyer. It depicts the 
straight-on view of the artist 
from the shoulders up in the 
foreground, the shadows of 
barbed wire crisscrossing his 
face. The background is filled 
with fellow inmates, talking 
and working out; one interacts 
with a prison guard whose face 
is obscured, another is elderly 
and in a wheelchair. If it were 
a photograph, DeJesus would 
stare directly into the camera 
lens, his expression somber and 
silent.

“He’s asking us, I think, to 

do something about it,” Paul 
said.

Young ‘M’ lineup stands out 
in narrow loss to Terrapins

Wolverines can’t 
overcome injuries, 

but freshmen 
flash potential

By JORDAN HERBSTMAN 

Daily Sports Writer

The Michigan men’s lacrosse 

team showed up to its Big Ten 
season-opener determined to 
pull off an upset against No. 
5 Maryland. The Wolverines 
put together an impressive 
performance, but in the end 
they came up just short and lost, 
8-7. 

Michigan 
(0-1 
Big 
Ten, 

3-6 overall) found itself in a 
tough position with its two 
leading offensive players out 
with injuries, so it turned to 
a younger starting lineup to 
battle the Terrapins (1-0, 7-2). 
The Wolverines started five 
freshmen 
and 
two 
seniors 

Saturday, compared to zero and 
four for Maryland, respectively 

With a young squad on the 

field, 
Michigan 
focused 
its 

effort on utilizing a combination 
of freshman youth and senior 
experience to combat the strong 
Maryland team. 

After falling behind 1-0 in the 

first quarter, the Wolverines 
turned to their seniors to get 
things going. Just over five 
minutes into the game, senior 
attacker Peter Kraus continued 
the 
aggressive 
play 
shown 

earlier by fellow senior Evan 
Glaser, and netted his first goal 
of the day to tie the game.

Senior faceoff specialist Brad 

Lott won the following faceoff 
to 
give 
Michigan 
another 

possession straight off the goal. 
Once again, the Wolverines 
turned to another senior in 
midfielder Mike Hernandez, 
who sniped in a shot to give 
Michigan a 2-1 lead.

Lott played a key role in 

the first quarter success for 
Michigan by securing three of 
the five faceoffs, two of which 
came directly after goals. 

“I thought Brad Lott was a 

big part of our ability to be in 
the game today,” said Michigan 
coach John Paul. “Once we 
started winning faceoffs early, 
and 
once 

we 
had 
got 

some stops on 
defense, some 
guys 
started 

believing.” 

After 

allowing 
two 

quick 
goals 

in the second 
quarter, 
the 

Wolverines fell 
back on their 
seniors once again. Hernandez 
and 
Kraus 
stepped 
up 
on 

offense, and Kraus found the 
back of the net for his second 
goal of the day, regaining the 
lead for Michigan early in the 
second quarter. 

Freshman 
attacker 
Rocco 

Sutherland 
also 
gave 
the 

Wolverines 
an 
impressive 

offensive 
effort. 
After 
the 

team went up, 4-3, Sutherland 
was determined to maintain 
possession by picking up ground 
balls off faceoffs and collecting 
missed shots behind the net, 
allowing 
Michigan 
to 
keep 

offensive possessions alive. 

The Wolverines fell behind, 

6-4, in the third quarter, but 
just as they did throughout 

the first half, the shorthanded 
Wolverines 
turned 
to 
the 

freshmen 
and 
seniors 
to 

stop 
the 
Terrapins 
from 

widening their lead. Kraus and 
Sutherland fired shot after shot, 
but it was freshman midfielder 
Decker Curran who scored the 
first goal of the quarter for 
Michigan. 

“It’s so awesome to see so 

many guys step in like that,” 
Kraus said. “If one guy goes 
down, whoever it is, if it’s a 
freshman or senior, he’s got to 
step up and play his role. That’s 

exactly what 
they 
did 

today.” 

In 
the 

fourth 
quarter, Kraus 
got 
back 
in 

on the action 
and netted his 
third goal of 
the day, tying 
the game at 
six.

“Luckily I was in the spot 

to get the shot off,” Kraus 
said. “(We) just kind of ran the 
offense correctly and that’s 
what happens.” 

However, a late push by 

Maryland was too much for the 
Wolverines, and they fell short 
by only one goal. Though it 
was not the result they wanted, 
Paul was still proud of his team 
and the potential the freshmen 
showed, as well as the poise the 
seniors exhibited. 

“We’ve been searching for the 

right guys, the right chemistry 
and the right execution, and it’s 
really just the next man up until 
we find the right group,” Paul 
said. “This group did a pretty 
commendable job.”

MEN’S LACROSSE

“It’s so awesome 
to see so many 

guys step in 
like that.”

Michigan continues home 
success in weekend sweep

By MIKE PERSAK 

Daily Sports Writer

In a surprisingly strong season, 

the No. 20 Michigan men’s 
tennis team has been fueled in 
its turnaround by consistently 
strong performances at home. 
The Wolverines have compiled 
a perfect 12-0 record at the 
Varsity Tennis Center, a record 
paramount to their surge into the 
ITA Top 25.

This weekend was more of 

the same for Michigan (4-1 Big 
Ten, 15-4 overall), as it hosted 
Indiana (0-3 Big Ten, 4-12 overall) 
on Friday and Purdue (1-2 Big 
Ten, 12-5 overall) on Sunday. 
The Wolverines came out of the 
weekend undefeated, beating both 
teams, 4-1.

“We’ve played well here,” said 

Michigan coach Adam Steinberg. 
“We’ve had a heavy home schedule 
this year, not like last year, where 
we were on the road a lot. I think 
the guys have gotten into a rhythm 
when playing here.”

The Wolverines, who have 

dubbed their home courts “The 
Slaughterhouse,” were in danger 
of having their flawless home 
record tarnished against Purdue. 
Despite charging to an early 3-0 
lead thanks to quick wins from the 
No. 6 and No. 5 players, freshman 
Myles Schalet and sophomore 
Davis Crocker, the Boilermakers 
showed some fight by winning in 
the No. 1 singles match. Purdue 
also prolonged other matches 
before finally being defeated by a 
No. 4 singles win from Michigan 
sophomore Runhao Hua, 6-3, 4-6, 
6-2.

After the match was done, 

Michigan’s 
focus 
immediately 

shifted. But the shift wasn’t to its 
next opponent like it normally is. 
Instead, the Wolverines geared up 
to teach the fundamentals of tennis 

to children in the community in a 
post-match clinic.

 “I think it’s important that 

we get a nice home base,” said 
sophomore Davis Crocker. “We 
have had great fans this year. The 
fans have been awesome. Club 
tennis has been incredible as far as 
influencing matches, and I think 
it’s important, like with the kid’s 
clinic today, to get the community 
involved with the tennis.”

But while the fans are a bonus 

for the team, it is ultimately 
the improved play on the court 
and comfort with their home 
surroundings that have resulted in 
Michigan’s success.

“I think we have more of a 

comfort level here,” Crocker said. 
“It’s easier for us to support each 
other from these specific standing 
points. We’re used to the courts, 

and I think that all plays a factor.”

Though the home victories 

for the Wolverines have driven 
them to their current place in 
the standings, they will now be 
forced to get wins away from Ann 
Arbor. They will play four straight 
conference matches on the road 
before returning home to finish 
the regular season.

But if Michigan is able to 

maintain its perfect home record, 
it will have already improved 
on its disappointing seasons of 
the past. The Wolverines have 
already 
beaten 
three 
ranked 

teams at home this season. They 
beat Duke, Penn State and Tulsa, 
who were ranked No. 25, 25 and 
22 at the time, respectively. So 
now, all that’s left to do is prove 
that Michigan can get it done on 
the road, too.

Isaac impresses in Spring Game

Redshirt junior 
makes case as 
complementary 
back for 2016

By JACOB GASE

Daily Sports Editor

When Ty Isaac broke free 

for a 76-yard touchdown run 
against UNLV last September, it 
looked like he was announcing 
his arrival as a force to be 
reckoned with in the Michigan 
football team’s backfield.

But 
after 
a 
two-fumble 

performance 
at 
Maryland 

two weeks later, and later an 
“internal 
matter” 
that 
led 

to 
him 
being 
temporarily 

left off the team’s dress list, 
Isaac plummeted down the 
depth 
chart. 
After 
getting 

just two carries each against 
Northwestern on Oct. 10 and 
Michigan State on Oct. 17, Isaac 
didn’t touch the ball again for 
the rest of the season, leaving 
his future in the Wolverine 
backfield in doubt.

Fast-forward 
six 
months 

later, though, and the redshirt 
junior has burst right back into 
the picture.

As the featured back for 

the Maize team in Michigan’s 
Spring Game on Friday night 
— last year’s top backs, senior 
De’Veon Smith and fifth-year 
senior Drake Johnson, both 
found themselves on the Blue 
team — Isaac picked up 10 
carries and made the most of 
them.

Early in the second quarter, 

after netting zero yards on 
his first two attempts, Isaac 
took a handoff at midfield for 
a 29-yard gain down the right 
sideline, setting up a 13-yard 
touchdown pass for the Maize 
team’s first score of the game. 
On a nearly identical play in 
the third quarter, Isaac broke 
outside again, threw a stiff arm 
in the secondary and picked 
up 30 yards to the Blue 21-yard 
line. Five plays later, redshirt 
sophomore quarterback Wilton 

Speight found the end zone on 
a bootleg scamper that ended 
up being the game-winning 
touchdown.

Isaac looked like a different 

player under the lights Friday, 
and he felt like one, too. So far 
this offseason, Isaac has shed 
14 pounds and five percent body 
fat.

“I feel a lot better, just all 

around, physically,” Isaac said. 
“I dropped some weight, lost 
some body fat and I just feel 
really good physically. I can 
play faster. ... The difference 
between 10 pounds or 15 pounds 
is huge — I could even tell 
during conditioning stuff.”

It might be difficult to get 

carries in a backfield that 
already has a starter set in 
stone — after Smith picked 
up 753 rushing yards and six 
touchdowns last season, the 
coaching staff has made it clear 
that it’s his job to lose.

Smith 
didn’t 
play 
much 

in the Spring Game, though, 

saying he was trying to “get 
(his) body all the way healthy 
before the season.” With no 
other back getting more than 
five carries, it was Isaac’s time 
to shine. Lighter and faster, 
he showed signs of the skill 
set that made him a five-star 
Southern 
California 
recruit 

before he ultimately transferred 
to Michigan.

Smith 
has 
noticed 
the 

dramatic changes in Isaac’s 
appearance and playing style, 
too. Smith’s mindset hasn’t 
wavered with Isaac’s resurgence 
— he’s dead set on keeping his 
job as the lead back — but he 
understands the benefits of a 
capable complementary option, 
and he thinks Isaac could be 
that player.

“Ty’s 
6-(foot)-3, 
230 

(pounds). It’s gonna be trouble 
for teams, with two power 
backs,” Smith said. “We have 
a stable of backs — everybody 
could play right now. I’ll be 
happy whoever’s backing me 

up.”

As the only running back to 

gain more than 11 yards on the 
ground — he had 78 — Isaac 
certainly took advantage of 
his opportunity Friday night. 
His 
strong 
performance 
in 

the Spring Game was just the 
culmination of an improved 
spring, one that had Michigan 
coach Jim Harbaugh and fifth-
year senior offensive lineman 
Kyle Kalis raving about his 
improvements over the last few 
weeks. Still, Isaac knows it’s 
going to take more than that to 
stay in the backfield mix in the 
fall.

“It’s good to hear it getting 

noticed,” Isaac said, “but it 
definitely can’t be something 
that you hear one time and 
think, ‘I’m all right, I’m good, I 
can lay back.’ I want to continue 
to be like that.

“Every time I come out, I 

want it to be noticed. I don’t 
have to talk about it. I’m just 
going to do it.”

Wolverines finish 
11th at Bryan Park

By LOGAN T. HANSEN

For the Daily

Following 
a 
multi-week 

reprieve from competition, the 
Michigan women’s golf team teed 
off over the weekend at Bryan 
Park Golf Course in Greensboro, 
N.C., participating in the Bryan 
National Collegiate from Friday 
through Sunday.

In the face of stiff competition 

— including heavyweights in No. 
20 Virginia, No. 21 Florida State 
and No. 28 East Carolina — and 
some unforgiving weather, the 
Wolverines finished 11th as a team 
with a total of 926 strokes over 
three days and 54 holes of golf.

Sophomore Kathy Lim led the 

way for the Wolverines, tying for 
eighth place individually with a 
career-best 224 (76-74-74) stroke 
total. The tally resulted in her 
second top-10 finish of the season.

“(Kathy) came off a tough week 

in Arizona a couple weeks ago 
and she came 
into 
practice 

each day with 
a 
purpose, 

had a plan and 
stuck 
to 
it,” 

said coach Jan 
Dowling. “I’m 
really proud of 
her that it paid 
off 
and 
that 

she was able 
to be resilient. 
As a coaching staff, we believe 
in her and I hope this gives her 
confidence to continue believing 
in herself.”

Lim carded the lowest totals in 

each round for Michigan, but she 
was quick to note that the course 
was no cakewalk.

“Overall it was a tough course 

to deal with,” Lim said. “We were 
definitely disappointed with the 
(11th-place) finish.”

Following Lim on the scorecard 

for the Wolverines was junior 
Grace Choi, who shot 232 (79-75-
78) and finished tied for 42nd. 
Senior 
Catherine 
Peters 
and 

sophomore Megan Kim both 

tallied 236 (81-78-77 and 80-77-79, 
respectively) and finished tied for 
51st, and sophomore Emily White 
came in at 242 (79-81-82) strokes, 
tying for 65th.

Conditions at Bryan Park Golf 

Course were not ideal for the 
15 squads participating in the 
weekend’s event. Friday’s opening 
18-hole round was delayed nearly 
four hours due to heavy rains and 
thunderstorms.

“We had some tough conditions 

to deal with this week, and our 
team did really well with that, 
actually,” Dowling said. “It was 
a course that’s already tough 
to begin with, but the rainy 
conditions and the 10- to 25-mile-
per-hour wind did not help at all.”

Dowling said the team was 

not familiar with the Greensboro 
course, 
meaning 
Thursday’s 

practice round was extremely 
important 
for 
them. 
The 

competition they saw over the 
weekend was no stranger to them, 

however.

“We’ve 

seen many of 
those 
teams 

throughout 
the whole year, 
which is great,” 
Dowling said. 
“You can’t get 
better 
unless 

you 
see 
the 

better teams. I 
know our team 

loves seeing that field; they’re 
competitors and we know that we 
were close to beating them if we 
improve our putting and a little bit 
of the short game.”

With 
the 
2016 
Big 
Ten 

Championships 
(Apr. 
22-24) 

waiting in the wings, Lim came 
away from the chilly rain-soaked 
outing with some positives as well.

“This course really showed us 

our true weaknesses,” Lim said, 
“Which is perfect because we 
are heading to Big Tens now — 
basically the most important event 
of our season. We’re excited to 
work hard on our weaknesses and 
get better.”

Berenson explains decision to stay

By KEVIN SANTO

Daily Sports Writer

Red Berenson stood up from 

his chair, black coffee in hand, 
and headed toward the door.

He cracked it open before 

stopping 
himself 
in 
the 

doorway, glancing back and 
cracking a smile.

“My wife is happy,” he said.
It was Berenson’s concluding 

statement after he spoke to the 
media for the first time since 
he announced Sunday that he 
would be returning as the head 
coach of the Michigan hockey 
team for the 2016-17 season.

The Wolverines’ coach for 

the past 32 seasons explained 
that three factors ultimately 
influenced 
his 
decision 
to 

return to Yost Ice Arena.

The first was the season-

ending 
player 
meetings 
he 

has with each member of the 
team. For the first time in his 
coaching career, his players had 
to ask if he would be behind the 
bench for the Wolverines in the 
coming year. That led Berenson 
to the realization — if he was 
going to make the decision, it 
would be better to do it sooner 
rather than later so that he could 
be up front with his players.

“(I wanted to) let them know 

that I’m all in if that’s a concern 
for them,” Berenson said. “I’d 
hate for a kid to leave school 
because I’m leaving. I don’t 
think it should happen, but it 
could happen. If that would be 
the tipping point … I thought 
that was important.”

The 
second 
factor, 
and 

a critical one according to 
Berenson, was his conversation 
with Athletic Director Warde 
Manuel. 
One 
of 
Berenson’s 

biggest concerns was standing 
in the way if Manuel thought it 
was an appropriate time for the 
program to appoint a new head 
coach. But that prospect was far 
from Manuel’s mind.

“He was really good and he 

was all for me coming back,” 
Berenson said. “That made me 
feel good, too. Not that I didn’t 
feel wanted. I wanted to feel 
like it was right for the team — 
from the players’ standpoint, 

from our staff and from our 
athletic director.”

And the third factor came 

from someone far from the 
annual team banquet in Ann 
Arbor 
on 
Sunday, 
where 

Berenson officially announced 
he was returning.

While deciding his future, 

Berenson received a phone call 
from a former player that played 
on his 1996 team. The former 
Wolverine reminded his old 
coach that on that same day 20 
years ago, Michigan captured 
its first NCAA Championship 
under 
Berenson’s 
command. 

But nostalgia didn’t bring the 
veteran coach back. 

“We had a short talk, and then 

he said, ‘By the way coach — I 
just want to let you know that 
changed my life, thank you for 
recruiting me,’ ” Berenson said. “ 
‘Michigan changed my life. I’ll be 
forever grateful.’

“That kind of put me back — 

this is why you’re coaching really, 
is for kids like this. Right away, I 
thought, ‘You know what? That 
sounds like me.’ When I came to 
Michigan as a player, it changed 
my life. … If I’m even on the fence, 
I can do this for one more year 
and we’ll go from there.”

Despite 
agreeing 
to 

return, Berenson has yet to 
sign paperwork to officially 
establish his contract terms. 
He has only agreed to continue 
coaching for this season, but 
that doesn’t mean 2016 will be 
a farewell tour. Berenson stated 
he will take it year by year, as he 
has in recent seasons.

More than anything, the 

program’s 
patriarch 
simply 

isn’t ready to give up coaching 
college hockey. It’s been his 
passion since his inaugural 
year in 1984, and that flame 
hasn’t been extinguished yet. 
Berenson revealed that he had 
offers to leave Ann Arbor for 
NHL coaching opportunities 
in the past, but had a simple 
explanation for why he turned 
those chances down: He thinks 
Michigan is where he belongs.

It fits, then, that Berenson’s 

most fulfilling life memory 
was not a heroic goal or win, 
but a moment in a Michigan 

classroom.

“Outside of after being here 

for a while, and winning a 
championship or doing this and 
doing that — my most fulfilling 
day in my hockey career was we 
won the Stanley Cup,” Berenson 
said. “They had the parade the 
next day. And the next day I was 
sitting in the business school 
starting on my MBA. I felt so 
good about that because I knew 
I wouldn’t be a hockey player 
much longer. … Was I ever 
glad I was gonna get my MBA. 
That’s how I’m wired. Not many 
people would point to that being 
their best day, but that was my 
best day.”

Berenson 
has 
consistently 

been a relentless proponent 
of college athletes, first and 
foremost, receiving a degree. 
He admits he won’t hold players 
back if they’re ready for the 
professional level. But to him, 
if an athlete is talented enough, 
the NHL will be waiting for 
them after they cross a stage at 
graduation.

After all, he marked adding 

credibility to college hockey as 
his greatest success as a player 
and a coach. When he suited up 

for the Wolverines as a player, 
he was told if he went to college, 
he wouldn’t make it to the NHL. 
Yet he proved those people 
wrong, playing professionally 
for 17 seasons.

Even when he returned to 

coach at Michigan, not much 
had changed. People still said 
if players went to college, 
they wouldn’t be drafted. But 
Berenson helped pioneer a new 
path. Gradually, the narrative 
changed. First, it changed to, 
“If you go to college you won’t 
be drafted as high.” Eventually, 
though, it became an option 
for someone with the dreams 
of playing in the NHL to add a 
college degree to their resume, 
too.

“I’ve always been big on life 

after hockey,” Berenson said. “I 
was kind of brainwashed that 
way from when I was young. I 
met these former pros and they 
said, ‘Go to school kid, don’t be a 
hockey bum like me.’ That really 
connected with me.”

Now, Berenson has at least 

another year to instill the same 
values he always has.

He doesn’t have a life after 

hockey. Not yet, anyway.

JAMES COLLER/Daily

Red Berenson will remain the head coach of the Michigan hockey team.

Reasserting their dominance

O

n March 25, the 
Michigan softball 
team seemed to be on 

its way to a routine victory 
over Northwestern. Fifth-year 
senior right-
hander Sara 
Driesenga 
was exuding 
confidence 
in the circle, 
senior second baseman Sierra 
Romero extended her hitting 
streak, and freshman catcher 
Alex Sobczak continued to show 
maturity behind the plate.

Then, the facade came off 

in the fourth inning. Sobczak 
struggled to keep balls in the dirt 
from going behind her, Driesenga 
gave hitters free passes to first 
base, and a Romero error allowed 
the Wildcats to score two runs.

As Michigan withered, the 

Wildcats pounced, turning a 
7-2 deficit into a 13-12 win. It 
stunned the Alumni Field crowd 
and rendered the Michigan 
alumni band quiet. The 
Wolverines collapsed. The No. 
2 ranked team in the country 
was suddenly 0-1 in conference 
play. They handed a victory to 
Northwestern as one day of Big 
Ten softball left them in last 
place.

“We just had a meltdown,” 

said Michigan coach Carol 
Hutchins. “They got momentum 
going their way. I thought we 
didn’t react well in any parts of 
our game. We had wild pitches, 
free bases and errors.”

The following Saturday and 

Sunday brought two Wolverine 
wins, but did little to reassure 
observers of Michigan’s 
preeminence. The Wolverines 
looked vulnerable in what 
promised to be a stronger 
conference this year, with the 
continuing emergence of No. 22 
Minnesota, No. 24 Ohio State, 
Indiana and Nebraska.

One week later, the equation 

could not be more different. In 
three commanding wins over 
the Hoosiers, the Wolverines 

asserted their dominance over 
one of the top teams in the 
conference. Hutchins is now 
the winningest coach in NCAA 
softball history and heads a team 
that is starting to look worthy of 
her stature.

Questions surrounded 

Michigan heading into 
Bloomington, but by the time the 
Wolverines returned home to 
Ann Arbor, they were answered. 
They looked the part once again, 
both in the circle and at the plate, 
in the matter of one week.

Romero asserted her place as 

the nation’s best player, hitting 
.875 with three homers and her 
first Big Ten Player of the Week 
honor of the season in her ever-
growing trophy haul.

And even outside of Romero, 

Michigan’s attack was well-
rounded. Junior third baseman 
Lindsay Montemarano continued 
her hot streak, junior left fielder 
Kelly Christner worked her 

way out of her slump and senior 
centerfielder Sierra Lawrence 
vaulted herself into the top spot 
of the program’s all-time stolen 
base list with 64.

“We’re not afraid to swing the 

bat. We’ve worked on it so much, 
... we all want to be great at it,” 
Romero said.

Junior right-hander Megan 

Betsa, who failed to record a 
single out but gave up four runs 
in the conference opener, cruised 
in Saturday’s 8-0 win with 
nine strikeouts for her fourth 
complete-game shutout of the 
season. Driesenga, exhausted by 
the end of last Friday’s outing 
against Northwestern, looked 
rejuvenated, registering zero 
walks in nine innings of action, 
as she improved to 13-0 on the 
year.

With Betsa and Driesenga 

mowing down Hoosier hitters 
with ease, Sobczak’s successful 
return behind the plate 

may prove the most positive 
development going forward.

Against Northwestern, 

Sobczak sat the series’ final 
two games, left to ponder the 
difficulties that come with 
playing what Hutchins routinely 
calls softball’s most difficult 
position. But in Bloomington, 
Sobczak regained her starting 
spot, played solid defense, 
notched two hits and gained 
back the trust that Hutchins 
endowed in her to start the 
season.

With the catcher position 

in increasingly sound hands, 
Michigan is looking devoid of 
any weaknesses. From Hutchins 
to her players, the Wolverines 
outplayed Indiana and put their 
faults behind them. They made 
their coach the sport’s all-time 
winningest and sent an ominous 
warning to their Big Ten rivals 
that this conference is firmly in 
their control.

‘M’ hot ahead of 
midweek games

By SYLVANNA GROSS

Daily Sports Writer

Erik Bakich refuses to look 

ahead. 
The 
Michigan 
coach 

preaches consistency, and to do 
that, a single-game perspective 
must be kept.

That attitude 

has resulted in 
an 
impressive 

record — 3-0 in 
the Big Ten and 
20-5 overall — 
the Wolverines’ 
best 
start 

through 
25 

games 
since 

1987. 
Now 

ranked 
No. 

17 
nationally, 

Michigan 
will 

hope to build 
upon its nine-
game winning streak as it faces 
Notre Dame and Bowling Green 
on Tuesday and Wednesday, 
respectively.

“We 
go 
into 
each 
game 

knowing we’re going to play as 
hard as we can,” Bakich said. 
“We’re going to give the best 
effort with the best energy while 
executing. I think the buy-in 
to that type of mindset is what 
we’re seeing and the success is a 
product of that attitude that (the 
athletes) bring.”

With seven weeks of Big Ten 

play ahead, it would be easy for 
Michigan to get wrapped up in 
scouting reports. But Bakich 
emphasizes the need to view every 
game as a “one-game series.” 

This week’s contests will be the 

first and only time the Wolverines 
will face the Fighting Irish and 
the Falcons. And spirits are 
high after Michigan’s sweep at 
Northwestern. 

Senior Matt Ramsay was named 

the Big Ten Co-Player of the Week 
after a standout performance 

in last weekend’s Big Ten series 
opener against Northwestern. He 
finished the weekend with eight 
runs on seven hits and garnered 
a team-high nine runs batted-in, 
something Ramsay attributes to 
the strength of his team.

“I think we don’t really give 

the (opponent’s) pitching staff 
a time to take a breath and 
I 
think 
that’s 
remarkable,” 

Ramsay said. “We learned that 
we can take a punch and we can 
bounce back especially with our 
offensive. We learned to just 
have confidence.” 

Ramsay is the first Wolverine 

to be named Player of the Week, 
but two of his teammates have 
combined to win three Big Ten 
Pitcher of the Week awards — two 
for sophomore left hander Oliver 
Jaskie and one for junior left 
hander Brett Adcock. 

“It’s nice to get some recognition 

for hard work,” Bakich said. “But 
we’re really just focused on how 
we’re going to continue to move 
the program forward.”

Notre Dame (14-11) is hosting 

Michigan after a three-game 
series against Wake Forest in 
which it won two of three games.
The Fighting Irish are currently 
fourth in the Atlantic Division of 
the Atlantic Coastal Conference 
and tied for fifth place in a league 
with No. 14 North Carolina, 
Georgia Tech and Virginia. 

Bowling Green is traveling to 

Ann Arbor with a 11-17 record 
and having won its last two 
games, both against Toledo. 

But Bakich insists he doesn’t 

care who the Wolverines play so 
long as they stick to their game. 

“No matter who we’re playing, 

we’re going to do whatever 
we have to do in that game to 
come out on top,” Bakich said. 
“I don’t think there’s a need to 
say anything different. As long 
as we stay consistent.”

Powerful offense 
driving Michigan

By ETHAN WOLFE

Daily Sports Writer

Against 
Central 
Michigan 

on Tuesday, the then-No. 20 
Michigan baseball team needed 
timely and quick baserunning to 
pick up the victory. But at times 
in the Wolverines’ three-game 
series 
against 
Northwestern 

this weekend, the batting order 
didn’t have to do much running 
at all.

This was especially true for 

fifth-year senior left fielder 
Matt Ramsay, whose play last 
weekend warranted a selection 
as Big Ten Co-Player of the 
Week with Minnesota’s Matt 
Fiedler. 

Ramsay spent most of his 

time jogging around the bases 
in the second game of Friday’s 
doubleheader, hitting a career-
high 
three 
home 
runs 
in 

Michigan’s 12-3 victory. Prior to 
the series against the Wildcats 
(1-5 Big Ten, 7-21 overall), 
Michigan (3-0, 20-5) had just six 
home runs as a team all season.

To go along with his three 

homers, he finished the day 
with five hits in six at-bats, 
seven runs batted-in and four 
runs — all single-game season-
highs for any Wolverine batter 
thus far.

But it wasn’t just Ramsay who 

was enjoying the performance.

“After the second (home 

run) they gave me the silent 
treatment 
in 
the 
dugout,” 

Ramsay said. “I put my stuff 
down and then they mobbed 
me. After my third one, I was 
met by (Wenson) at the plate 
and he just said, ‘Who are you? 
What is going on right now?’ 
They were great.”

Added 
Michigan 
coach 

Erik Bakich: “I haven’t seen 
a game like that since I was a 
player. I haven’t seen it in 20 
years. It’s a memorable day 
and one he’ll never forget. The 
contributions he’s made have 
been outstanding.”

Aside from Ramsay’s success 

in the series’ second game, 
Northwestern also had trouble 
keeping him off of the basepaths 
in the other two games. Despite 
going 0-for-3 in the opener, 
Ramsay still managed to get on 
base three times as a result of 
two walks and a fielding error. 
In 
Sunday’s 
game, 
Ramsay 

remained disciplined at the 
plate, collecting two walks and 
an infield single to get him to 
first base three times again. 
Throughout 
the 
weekend, 

Ramsay got on base 11 times in 
17 plate appearances and scored 
eight runs.

Ramsay’s ability to get on 

base was crucial to setting up 
the middle of the order to drive 
in runs, namely junior catcher 
Harrison Wenson and junior 
center fielder Cody Bruder.

Wenson got to showcase his 

power once again, going 6-for-
12 in the series with 10 RBI, 
including 
three 
extra-base 

hits, while Bruder had his best 
offensive performance of the 
season during Sunday’s game. 
Bruder went 3-for-5 and plated 
a game-high four RBI in the 
Wolverines’ 11-9 win.

But Bruder was overshadowed 

by 
Ramsay’s 
electrifying 

weekend.

“We didn’t let the (opposing) 

pitching staff take a breath, and 
that’s the mark of a high-quality 
offense,” Ramsay said.

Ramsay’s career day was 

emblematic of Michigan’s potent 
offense against Northwestern, 
which was dominant in all 
facets. As a whole, the batting 
order combined to score 33 
runs on 43 hits, 21 of which 
came in game two of Friday’s 
doubleheader.

At the beginning of the 

season, the pitching staff had to 
anchor an inconsistent offense. 
But the Wolverines have been 
clicking in all phases of the 
game as of late, and their recent 
power surge on offense has 
carried them to its best 25-game 
start since 1987.
