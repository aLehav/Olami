As job availability
dwindles, corporate
recruiters make
fewer college visits

University students looking
to benefit from the usually vast
pool of recruiters who come to
campus each year will be forced
to impress a smaller crowd this
year as companies try their best
to survive the current economic
downturn.
The United States Bureau of
Labor Statistics reported a 7.6
percent national unemployment
rate as of January - the highest it
has been since 1992. According to
figures released yesterday by the
Michigan Department of Energy,
Labor and Economic Growth,
unemployment rose to 1L6 per-
cent in January in the state. A
tougher job market exacerbated
by company layoffs nationwide
has left in its wake a significant
reduction in internships and full-
time position opportunities for
students.

Director of Career Develop-
ment and Student Affairs at the
Ross School of Business Al Cotro-
ne cited the financial crisis as
one major factor underlying the
reduced recruiter presence on
campus.
"We have seen a decrease in the
number of on-campus interview-
ing schedules offered this year,"
Cotrone said. "That has been led
by the investment banks."
He said students now faced
with the pressures of a strained
job market must rely on a self-
directed search and leverage the
University's vast alumni net-
work.
Cotrone also said that large
companies have often come to
campus during stronger econom-
ic times with specific recruitment
goals in mind, but smaller and
midsize businesses offer signifi-
cant opportunities for job seekers
in today's market.
The reverberations of the eco-
nomic downturn have also been
felt at other universities which
are reporting lower recruitment
numbers compared to past years.
Theda Rudd, associate direc-
tor in career cervices at Michi-
gan State University, said that no

Gov, says Michigan is
uniquely positioned
to build a renewable
energy sector
By MALLORY JONES
For the Daily
Gov. Jennifer Granholm teamed
up with Danish officials yester-
day as part of a joint program to
increase the number of renewable

energy jobs in a state that has long
relied on a troubled auto industry
to power its economy.
Denmark's Minister of Climate
and Energy Connie Hedegaard co-
signed a Memorandum of Under-
standing with Granholm yesterday
afternoon in the Michigan League
Ballroom, pledging to share infor-
mation and technology with the
state to help jump-start the ailing
economy with a new energy indus-
try.
Up until the early 1970s, Den-
mark was almost 100 percent

dependent on imported fuel. In the
aftermath of the Oil Crisis of 1973,
when the price of oil more than dou-
bled because of the OAPEC embar-
go, officials in Denmark noticed
the country's need for alternative
sources of energy.
Denmark then began major ini-
tiatives to break its dependence on
oil.
The country now boasts unem-
ployment figures of only 2.2
percent, and is spearheading a
movement to help Michigan - with
an unemployment rate of 10.2-per-

cent - experience similar results.
During the summit, Granholm
explained to a crowd of business
leaders and experts on renewable
energy that Michigan is uniquely
positioned for new business in the
renewable energy sector - much
like Denmark in the 1970's.
The state's advantages, Gra-
nholm said, include a large work-
force, 3,288 miles of shoreline
- prime real estate for wind farms
- and experience handling an
emerging industry.

Speaker from Better
Place pushes plan
to decrease global
dependence on oil
By DEVON THORSBY
For the Daily
Last night in the Rackham
Amphitheatre, a crowd of about 150
students and community members
listened to a proposal to use elec-

tricity in a way the likes of Benja-
min Franklin and Thomas Edison
never could have envisioned.
Michael Granoff, the head of Oil
Independence Policies for Better
Place - an innovative new company
working to integrate zero-emission
cars into society - talked about the
steps his company has taken to cut
back on oil dependence around the
globe and the need for the United
States to follow its lead.
Better Place is already at work in
various countries including Israel,
Denmark, Australia and Canada -

and regions including California
and Hawaii - and hopes to extend
its reach to the entire United States
to make electric cars a reasonable
alternative to gas-powered cars.
Granoff spoke yesterday of Bet-
ter Place's desire to decrease world-
wide oil dependence and make a
shift to a more renewable, cost-
effective and eco-friendly way to
power cars.
"You can move the country off
oil, you can really move people very

LANSING
Michigan jobless
rate hits 11.6
percent in January
Michigan's unemployment rate
hit its highest point in a quar-
ter century in January, and some
economists say the worst likely is
yet to come in an auto-dominated
state that slipped into recession
well before most of the nation.
The state's seasonally adjusted
jobless rate rose to 11.6 percent,
Michigan officials said yester-
day, up from a revised rate of 10.2
percent in December. It's likely
Michigan still will lead the nation
in unemployment when all states
are done reporting their January
numbers.
Economists had predicted that
Michigan's jobless situation would
worsen in 2009 before starting to
stabilize somewhat in 2010. Based
on January's jobs report, things
might be getting worse faster than
expected just a few months ago.
The last time Michigan's unem-
ployment rate was higher than the
current level was in March 1984,
when it reached 11.7 percent. Sev-
eral layoffs have been announced
that aren't included in the state's
latest jobless rate.
WASHINGTON
Gupta withdraws
from the search for
surgeon general
CNN medical correspondent Dr.
Sanjay Gupta won't be the next sur-
geon general, the Obama adminis-
tration confirmed yesterday.
Gupta, 39, a neurosurgeon with
star appeal, was seen as President
Barack Obama's first pick for the
job. He would have brought instant
recognition to the office of surgeon
general, a post that has lacked vis-
ibility since the days of C. Everett
Koop during Ronald Reagan's pres-
idency.
An administration said that
Gupta had been under "serious
consideration" but took himself out
of the running because he wants
to focus on his medical career and
spend more time with his family.
"We know he will continue
to serve and educate the public
th ouiglh h work with mfiedla and
in the medical arena," said the offi-
cial, speaking on condition of ano-
nymity because of the sensitivity of
nominations.
WASHINGTON
Senate Republicans
force vote delay of
huge spending bill
Senate Republicans, demanding
the right to try to change a huge
spending bill, forced Democrats
yesterday night to put off a final
vote on the measure until next
week.
The surprise development will
force Congress to pass a stopgap
fundingbill to avoid a partial shut-
down of the government.
Republicans have blasted the

$410 billion measure as too cost-
ly. But the reason for GOP unity
in advance of a key procedural
vote was that Democrats had not
allowed them enough opportuni-
ties to offer amendments.
Majority Leader Harry Reid,
D-Nev., canceled the vote, saying
he was one vote short of the 60
needed to close debate and free the
bill for President Barack Obama's
signature.

Michigan lawmaker
wants to repeal
graduation rules
A Republican member of the
state House says he will introduce
legislation to get rid of Michigan's
new mandatory high school gradu-
ation requirements.
Rep. Brian Calley of Portland
said in a statement yesterday
the Michigan Merit Curriculum
requirements are inflexible, will
limit educational choice and lead to
higher dropout rates.
The requirements including four
m years of math take effect for the
graduating class of 2011. Students
now are taking the tougher classes
required for a diploma.
Democratic Gov. Jennifer Gra-
nholm is a strong supporter of the
more stringent mandatory curricu-
lum she signed into law in 2006.
Her administration has fought
efforts to water down the require-
ments.

ment numbers was noted for the
fall term. However, she already
estimated a 10- to 20-percent
decrease in the number of recruit-
ers appearing on campus for the
spring term - which began in
January.
Rudd noted that employers are
opting to post recruitment infor-
mation through the MSU website
to cut back on company costs. She
said that while interview sched-
ules for employers have often been
delayed due to company uncer-
tainty, most seek to maintain vis-
ibility in hopes of future greater
hiring needs.
The Colleges of Arts and Sci-
ences at Ohio State University
reported a similar trend.
According to Jennifer Colum-
ber, the program assistant for the
Arts and Sciences Career Ser-
vices Office, 100 spots for employ-
ers were reserved for last year's

Spring Career Day with 40 other
organizations on a waitlist. This
year, the number of available posi-
tions has been reduced to 80, and
only 70 have been confirmed so far
for the April event.
Columber said that, unlike pre-
vious years, many of those busi-
nesses and employers are looking
only to hire for internships, not
full-time positions.
Despite the evident trend in
recruitment numbers across
universities, students looking to
enter the job market or acquire an
internship can pursue options for
alternative businesses that do not
necessarily coincide with their
majors.
Lynne Sebille-White, the
senior assistant director for
employer relations at the Univer-
sity of Michigan's Career Cen-
ter, said students can still put
their skill set and knowledge to
use and work toward a career of
interest albeit through less tradi-

tional paths.
Sebille-White, who oversees
the recruiting system and works
with employers who come to the
University, mentioned how stu-
dents seeking to become investors
on Wall Street may do so through
analytical positions at the cor-
porate level in insurance orga-
nizations where numerical and
monetary analysis is still appli-
cable.
"If(students') firstchoice indus-
try isn't hiring in record numbers
right now, then they need to look
at alternative options in the short-
term," she said.
Sebille-White said that posi-
tions in financial planning,
fundraising and endowment man-
agement lend to marketable skills.
"The days of point-and-click job
searching and just relying on cam-
pus interviews are shifting now,"
she said. "Students need to be more
creative in terms of how they're
seeking out opportunities."

really open, and it's the athletics
and the Greek system," Stojanovs-
ki said.
Gabe Javier, the assistant
director of the Spectrum Center,
will be leading the workshop. He
said he wants the workshop to be
interactive and tailored to meet
the questions and concerns of the
attendees.
"We also want to talk about
myths versus facts and percep-
tions, perceptions versus the real
lives of people," Javier said. "We
wantto create spaces all over cam-
pus where people feel comfortable
being themselves."
During the winter and fall of
2007, the Spectrum Center con-
ducted a survey to gauge the
feelings of the Greek commu-
nity toward LGBT students. Sto-
janovski said that the survey's
results indicated that while many
individuals in the Greek commu-
nity were comfortable with LGBT
students, they perceived that their
houses were not.
"What came out of that sur-
vey was that, individually, people
were OK with it, but as you got
into bigger realms such as houses
and chapters, it was a little more
homophobic, and then as you got

Ross School of Business grad-
uate student Bharath Iyengar,
who attended the event, said he
thinks it's beneficial for the state
to have leaders committed to a
renewable energy industry. But
he was a bit skeptical of the part-
nership.

"NYPD was always open later

"I'm always on South U. and that's
a common place that we'll stop on
our way home so I'm kind of a little
disappointed."
Hanzel said that although she'll
be upset once the store closes, she
expects that some will benefit
from the pizza joint's departure.
"I guess Backroom (Backroom
Pizza) is going to get a little more
business," she said.
LSA freshman Mike Jenkins
said he was "sad, disturbed and
distraught" to find out the restau-
rant will be leaving South U.
"It's such a good atmosphere
even more homophobic," Sto-
janovski said.
Stojanovski said the aim of the
workshop is to further the con-
versation and increase awareness
about issues LGBT students face
in the Greek community. The
workshop, which Stojanovski
said he hopes becomes an annual
event, was also introduced to
new members of the Greek com-
munity through a similar work-
shop during the Interfraterntiy
Council's New Member Day last
semester.
"What we want to do is increase
the awareness and make people
realize that this isn't so weird
and it's not so awkward and it
shouldn't be so difficult to deal
with, because the entire concept
of the Greek system is that they're
supposed to be brothers and sis-
ters and support each other," he
said.
Stojanovski, LSA senior and
former member of Chi Psi, said
another goal of the workshop is to
change people's views of the rela-
tionship between the LGBT com-
munity and the Greek system.
"I'm a member of the Greek
system and I think it's a great
thing," he said. "So we want to
change people's perceptions from
the outside looking in, and from
the inside looking out."
Javier also said the workshop is
an important first step in bridging
the gap between LGBT students

have a lot to offer."
U.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow
(D-Mich.), who joined the summit
through a video connection, reit-
erated the need for the state not
to merely adapt alternative, envi-
ronmentally-friendly energy prac-
tices, but to create a new industry
altogether.
"The bottom line for me is to
make sure we're not just using
alternative energy," she said,
"but making the technology
here."
because it's so college student-ori-
ented," he said. "There's nothing
better than that barbeque chicken
pizza at 3 a.m."
Grillo said the restaurant will
be offering discounts to help stu-
dents cope with the location's
departure.
"We're going to be running
some farewell specials to just let
everyone know that we're saying
goodbye to South U. for a while,"
he said.
Grillo added that he hasn't com-
pletely ruled out the possibility-
that the restaurant will return to
South U.
"You never know what's going
ta0- jen," hesaid.'
and Greeks, who serve as central
figures on campus.
"Greeks are really great lead-
ers on campus, and their leading
can also be a really good example
for social justice," Javier said. "I
think that there are stereotypes
about gay people and we want to
debunk those and there are also
stereotypes about people who are
in fraternities and sororities and
we want to debunk those too.
"We want to add depth to the
experience of being Greek and
giving people the opportunity to
be allies and to learn more about
different folks is part of that," he
said.
IFC President Ari Parritz said
that while the workshop is not
mandatory for fraternity mem-
bers, it is strongly encouraged
because increasing awareness of
LGBT issues in the Greek commu-
nity is a high priority for the IFC.
"We recognize that IFC in
particular struggles with LGBT
awareness, and we understand
that the topic is uncomfortable
for many of our members, but we
are moving ahead as quickly, effi-
ciently, and practically as we can,"
Parritz said in an e-mail inter-
view.
"Right now, there is little doubt
that some of our members do
not feel comfortable coming out
within our system," he said. "That
is a reality we are doing all in our
power to change."

Fraternity members
delivered needed
supplies themselves
after event

The Ronald McDonald House
Charity, an organization that
strives to improve the health
and well being of children, just
received a boost to the funds that
go toward helping hospitalized
kids.
The Psi Upsilon Freternity
raised $1,400 through Winter-
fest, an event the fraternity has
hosted almost every year for the
past 10 to 15 years in their back-
yard. This year eight other frater-
nities and six sororities donated
$250 to compete in various games
on an ice rink in the fraternity's
back yard.
After the event, Psi U used the
money to buy bed sheets, snack
food, paper towels, coffee and
more to help "ease the burden"
of those staying in the Ronald
McDonald House of Ann Arbor,
Psi U President Luke Donahue
said. He and other fraternity
members delivered the items to
the house yesterday.
Donahue said that Winterfest
not only raised a lot of money for
the charity, it was also a fun way
to bring the Greek community
together.
"You usually don't see more
than two or three houses getting
together for an event," Donahue
said.

actually become an asset to making

According to a Better Place press
release from December2008, Isra-
el, the company's first region of
interest, is in the process of being
readied to take on mass ownership
of electric vehicles, with charg-
ing spots in parking lots to make
the use of electric cars possible for
everyday use.
"The (Israeli) President (Shi-
mon Peres) signed the bill to make
Israel free from oil by January
2018, it's the goal we're shooting
for and I think we're on target so
far to do that," Granoff said.
Granoff also explained the
importance of the expansion of
the electric car industry across
the United States, which would be
valuable from an economic per-
spective by decreasing the depen-

Josh Kappel, social chair of Psi
U said the event's turnout and
results were better than expect-
ed.
"It was an event that going
in not a lot of us knew what to
expect because we didn't have it
last year," he said. "This year we
met and passed all our expecta-
tions. The Greek community had
a great time and it's nice that they
were all able to give money to a
good cause."
Originally, the fraternity
brothers planned on donating
the money directly to the Ronald
McDonald charity but then they
decided that buying the items
themselves would more benefi-
cial.
"We thought it would be more
meaningful to them and to us to
go out and buy the supplies they
needed that are listed on their
website and drop it off there
directly," Kappel said. "It should
make more of a difference and
should be a lot easier for them
since they'll get the supplies
directly rather than having to go
and buy them themselves with
the money we raised."
On its wish list, the Ronald
McDonald house asked for items
like kitchen supplies, bathroom
and bedroom linens and family
entertainment items.
Donahue said the fraternity
chose the charity because of its
impact on the local community.
It houses parents of hospitalized
and sick children in Ann Arbor
for a low price.
"It's a larger charity that's well
known and well founded and also
since it's local it directly helps our
community," Donahue said.
dency on foreign oil.
"Close to 70 percent of (Ameri-
ca's) oilis imported, anditgoesup all

something that should be a tier-one
priorityforitheUnited States."
Concerning other environmen-
tally friendly cars, like hybrid cars
that use ethanol, Granoff pointed
out the electric car's superiority
in performance.
"The bottom line is that the
performance on the electric car
is better," he said. "There's more
efficiency, there's instant torque,
there's no transmission."
LSA sophomore Daniel Neu-
mann, a member of American
Movement for Israel, one of many
sponsors for the event, said he
sees Better Place's work toward an
alternative energy source for cars
as the best option out there today.
"Of the different alternatives to
gasoline that I've heard of, I think
Better Place is the best in terms of
having the whole system planned
out," Neumann said. "They don't
just have an idea; they have the
actual, tangible system ready to
be in place."

No plastic, no problem
City council should ban plastic bags to keep streets cleaner
Ann Arbor may soon join a recent green trend that started
last year when San Francisco banned the use of plastic bags
in its grocery stores. At Monday night's meeting, the Ann
Arbor City Council discussed the possibility of adopting a similar
ban to prevent the accumulation of plastic in the streets. Though the
city's decision to table the ban until the June 1 meeting was justified
because it allows the city to discuss the issue with local retailers and
residents, the ban should remain an important priority. Considering
that better alternatives to plastic exist, the city has a responsibility
to enact this ban.

A culture of immorality

A ban on plastic bags was presented to
the City Council last June to put an end to
the plastic bags floating around the streets
of Ann Arbor. If approved the ban will only
affect stores that gross more than $1 million
a year, like Meijer and Kroger. Stores that
can't afford to prohibit plastic bags will not
be affected. And Ann Arbor isn't the only
city considering plastic bag bans - cities
including Boston, Portland and Pheonix are
considering similar laws. Los Angeles voted
to ban plastic bags last July.
Petroleum-based plastic bags are an envi-
ronmental hazard because they contaminate
soil and waterways once they break down.
According to the environmental research
group Worldwatch,100billionbags eachyear
are thrown away by Americans. As a result,
cities including Ann Arbor spend substantial
amounts of money cleaning these bags from
the streets.
The main reason the city is considering
this ban is because of plastic bags litteringthe
streets. It's a little ridiculous that this prob-
lem even exists - people should at least have
the decency to throw their trash in one of the
numerous garbage cans scattered along the
city streets. Regardless of the city's eventual

decision, Ann Arbor'scitizens should dispose
of their trash in a more responsible way.
But regardless of the motivation, passing
such a ban would have many positive effects.
Plastic bags are an unnecessary risk to the
environment, and the city will be much
cleaner without them. What the city needs to
do now is select an alternative to plastic bags
that will not cause more harm to the environ-
ment. While paper bags seem like the most
obvious choice, they are actually just as bad
because they require more energyto produce
and recycle than plastic. One alternative is
the use of compostable bags made from corn
or potato starch. San Francisco chose this
option after implementing its ban.
Of course, the least costly and most practi-
cal solution is for stores to distribute reusable
cloth bags that customers bring with them
when they shop. Stores like Meijer already
offer shoppers this environmentally friendly
option. Some shoppers may look at the use
of cloth bags as inconvenient, but the con-
servational quality of cloth bags make them
well worth it. But whether or not cloth bags
become the option of choice, environmental
benefits - and cleaner streets - should have
Ann Arbor shoppers welcoming the change.

y housemates and I have
on-demand service with
our cable television pack-
age. Last week was
the selection of free
movies available
particularly excit-
ing. Why? Because
I was able to reac-
quaint myself with
Atticus Finch.
Atticus, the
main character of
Harper Lee's novel NEIL
"To Killa Mocking- TAMBE
bird" and its 1962
film adaptation, is
heroic, though not
the web-slinging, caped-crusading
type. Atticus is of a rarer breed - a
moral hero. He is determined and
destined to do what is right. Moral
heroes are not people vaulted to
notoriety because of their impact on
the world or because of their talent,
but cherished because they identify
right from wrong and act accordingly.
They are the ones that take the time
to reflect deeply about what is right
and then act morally even at their
own detriment. While watching the
movie, I began thinking of the moral
heroes our society celebrates today.
One such hero was mentioned in
President Barack Obama's speech
to a joint session of Congress last
month. Obama told the story of Leon-
ard Abess, Jr., a Florida banker who
divvied up a $60 million windfall to
399 current employees and 72 former
employees of his bank as bonuses.
The CEO spread the wealth because
he always wanted to reward the
employees who stuck with him and
he was already well-off financially.
Essentially, he did it because it was
the right thing to do.

The second example I remem-
bered were the passengers of United
Airlines Flight 93, who retook their
hijacked plane on September 11, 2001
and crashed it in southern Pennsyl-
vania instead of taking the risk that
it might reach its intended target.
Those people are celebrated as moral
heroes - and rightfully so - because
they sacrificed their own lives to
spare many others from harm.
My list started running thin there.
I could not think of any other widely
recognized people who were cel-
ebrated for being moral heroes. Yes,
it is an expectation to do what's right
and therefore, moral heroes' actions
may not be necessarily considered
newsworthy, but signaling what's
right and wrong publicly should not
stop at shaming the immoral. We
should also celebrate moral heroes so
more people can be inspired by their
example to do what's right.
We need to celebrate moral
heroes because moral behavior mat-
ters. Think of Enron or other simi-
lar scandals in business or politics.
Even though there are many factors
which contribute to situations like
this, if leaders of the organizations
had identified right from wrong and
acted accordingly, maybe those situ-
ations could have been prevented. At
the very least, the harmful effects
would have been minimized.
And the University campus isn't
exempt from moral interplay, either.
We live in an environment where.
moral decision-making has serious
consequences, whether it's decid-
ing whether or not to slip a pill into
another person's Solo cup, cheat on
a significant other or steal silver-
ware from a dormitory cafeteria. On
this campus, doing the right thing
isn't always easy. When people balk

on morally sound decisions, there
are costs for themselves and others
affected by their actions, just like in
life outside the Ann Arbor bubble.
But doing the right thing is also
important when it may not hurt other
people. Take the example of a student
using Adderall - a drug prescribed to
treat Attention Deficit Hyperactive
Looking for real
moral heroes in

today's society.

I

Disorder that provides an unnatural
ability to focus when taken by people
without the disorder - as a study aid.
Even though no physical harm is done
to anybody else and there are no side
effects to the user, it's still wrong.
Adderall is just like steroids in baseball
because it taints the integrity of the
game. Just like steroids, Adderall con-
tributes to a culture of immorality that
pressures other students to participate
in immoral acts just to keep up.
This is where moral heroes come
in. Society needs people to break
with the culture of immorality on
campus and across the country. We
need to recognize moral heroes so
that their deeds can inspire virtuous 4
deeds instead of vicious ones. Then,
the rest of us can follow in their foot-
steps with smaller moral acts of our
own. Our campus and our society
could certainly use more people like
Atticus Finch.

We're all a little bit racist

As the Michigan Student Assembly examines its own future on campus, the Daily would
like students to voice their opinions on what should be a part of its agenda.

Constructing luxury

Individuals who post comments on the come-
dy blog stuffwhitepeoplelike.com love to express
their deepest thoughts on race. On Feb. 14, an
Internet user under the alias "screwobama"
wrote, "I would've completely been pissed if i got
fucked and was born in a non-white country."
Although website owners may like these people
because controversial comments result in more
hits and increased ad revenue, many readers -
myself included - can't help thinking that any-
one who posts this kind of comment is probably
an asshole.
Like the elusive bathroom stall graffiti artist,
anonymous Internet commentators frequently
say things that would be unacceptable in a face-
to-face interaction. On stuffwhitepeoplelike.
com, a satirical blog that lists the things white
people supposedly like, many of these comments
deal with race and social issues. These conversa-
tions reveal an array of frightening attitudes, but
in many ways, they represent the way our society
thinks about social issues.
Part of the joke of stuffwhitepeoplelike.com
is that most of the articles have very little to do
with race. The authors' entries are not directed
at all white people, as suggested by the title,
but rather a growing culture in which Ameri-
cans are desperately trying to prove their own
uniqueness and sophistication - which the
author' like to criticize. Although posts that
describe "what white people like" such as "#14
Having Black Friends" are racial, posts like "#9
Making You Feel Bad About Not Going Outside"
or "#41 Indie Music" are not. Perhaps the cul-
ture this blog criticizes is dominantly white and
wealthy, but the majority of criticisms are unre-
lated to race.
Even though the blog is supposed to be funny
(and, in my opinion, succeeds), posts such as
"#16 Gifted Children" or "#101 Being Offended"
provoke users to post comments about social
issues. The biggest problem here is that users'
ability to remain anonymous allows them to say
socially inappropriate things without worrying
about being held responsible. There's no way
to stop people from claiming that non-whites
are just jealous if they cannot afford to live in
an expensive neighborhood or that sexism only
applies to ugly people. Some users have begun
to create their own lists such as "Stuff Black

People Like" or "Stuff Chinese People Hate."
The blog itself is not racist, but its edgy material
provokes people to say things I would be sur-
prised to hear in public.
These comments are often idiotic, but some-
times, they accurately portray how society thinks
about particular issues. For instance, our society
is obsessed with assigning stereotypes. Internet
users frequently discuss whether the list of stuff
white people like accurately represents white
people, saying things like, "I must not be a true
white person if I don't like coffee" or the opposite,
"I'm not white, butI like bumperstickers." Many
claim that the blog is absolutely right about the
behavior of white people, while others angrily
assert that the blog isn't representative. All these
comments miss the satire of the website and por-
tray a society willingto believe that race depends
on generalizations.
Maybe we should regard these people as crazy.
But comments on stuffwhitepeoplelike.com are
just extreme examples of how many individu-
als would talk about race in casual conversation.
The people visiting stuffwhitepeoplelike.com
are likely to be the same people who are search-
ing youtube.com and collegehumor.com to divert
themselves from work. As a result, the comments
more closely resemble casual conversation than
on websites like those of The New York Times or
The Wall Street Journal, where users are more
careful to make sure that their comments are not
blatantly offensive. Although most would not talk
with the same sense of superiority as Mr. "scre-
wobama," I don't think it's farfetched to say that
the average American would think to himself,
"Thank God I was born in America."
A line from the musical Avenue Q says that
everyone is a little bit racist. On a broader scale,
this statement means that, even though it is easy
to criticize people who hold unacceptable views,
everyone makes overgeneralizations and igno-
rant assumptions about race and social issues.
The comments on stuffwhitepeoplelike.com may
be extreme, butthey do not completely misrepre-
sent how we as asociety think aboutsocial issues.
Before we shun them as crazies, we have to real-
izethattheir mindsets are somewhatreflective of
the way we view ourselves.

'll be honest with you - I've
always been skeptical about
North Quad, the new dorm cur-
rently being built at
the corner of State
St. and East Wash- ,
ington Ave.
It's not the
destruction of the
historic Frieze
Building I'm upset
about, although
a lot of my fellow
locals were sad to MEG
see it go. After all, YOUNG
the place was full
of asbestos.
It's about what
North Quad symbolizes to me. Last
fall, construction on campus totaled
$1.3 billion dollars. Many of those
projects are still in progress, and the
Regents recently approved even more.
God knows that Michigan needs the
construction jobs, but what motivates
the boom?
North Quad is known on campus as
"Mary Sue Coleman's idea." In an Ann
Arbor News article (North Quad to get
new look, 7/31/2006), she said that she
was hoping that North Quad would
give the entrance to campus a certain
"wow" factor. And we're spending
$175 million to get it.
Don't misunderstand me - some
of the facilities we're getting are
astounding. I appreciate state-of-the-
art technology and a clean, bright
learning space. But I think that many
of the University's construction proj-
ects are an attempt to enter the aca-
demic version of an arms race with
private schools.
North Quad will be able to house
460 students in suite-style dorm
rooms. One style comes with a living
room, another with four singles. Each

room will have a bathroom. Oh, yeah,
and this dorm will not be certified by
the Leadership in Energy and Envi-
ronmental Design's Green Building
Rating System.
The dining hall will also try to
compete with gourmet campus eater-
ies across the country, as noted by a
recent Michigan Daily article (Catch-
up cuisine, 9/16/2008). It might seem
too good to be true, but it may just be
too good to afford.
Who will be living in these rooms?
Affordable campus housing is already
difficult to find, and neither private
developers nor the University seem to
understand. Everything being built is
increasingly more luxurious. What's
wrong with the idea that students eat
ramen and wear shower shoes?
Our fixation on image wouldn't be
a problem if tuition were not steadily
rising each year. Rather than spend-
ing money to house high-maintenance
students, shouldn't we lower the
tuition costs of our public university?
In such tough economic times, how
we spend our budget speaks especial-
ly loudly about our values. It seems
to me that as much of our surplus
should be directed toward academic
excellence as possible, not attempt-
ing to improve dormitory or dining
hall rankings.
Another example of the Universi-
ty's ignorance of actual student needs
is the change in venue for the Screen
Arts and Cultures program. I am in
Film Production classes here, and the
University's decision to move studios
and equipment rooms to the Modern
Languages Buildinghas disappointed
me greatly. Currently, the program
calls the Argus II Building home.
And although a few blocks from cam-
pus, Argus II has plenty of space for
film editing rooms, production stu-

dios, and drive-up space for the 500
pounds of camera and lighting equip-
ment necessary for each upperclass-
man film project.
Instead, this film equipment is
going to be placed in the second floor
of the MLB, where students will have
to drag it around hallways, down
elevators, through double doors and
across the sidewalk to have access to

Talkingto Screen Arts and Cultures
faculty who are against these deci-
sions, it seems like they were made just
the way decisions on tuition increases
are: over the summer, behind closed
doors. Although better facilities are
intended to attract top-notch faculty,
the process of building them has been
deaf to the requests of some teachers
we already have.
Ultimately, I have enough good
sense to know that North Quad will
be a beautiful facility with more than
a few blessings. But as long as the
project is motivated by a craving for
the "wow" factor, it will seem to me
to be out of step with our real needs:
low costs, convenience and academ-
ics to help our students (and our
state) soar.

A lineup of
mixed merit

Celibacy: all the rage.

Tween pop trainwreck

Even star power can't rescue
the Jonas Brothers in this
worthless concert film
By NOAH DEAN STAHL
Daily Arts Writer
In many profound ways, "Jonas Brothers:
The 3D Concert Experience"
is emblematic of the most sig-
nificant flaws of moviegoing
mass culture. ,ongs
For those unfamiliar with
the phenomenon that is the Bracers
Jonas Brothers, they are a The 3D
musical group comprised of
siblings Kevin, Joe and Nick
Jonas. Having worked their Experience
way up the Disney adder 16
through their associations atQuality
with Miley Cyrus (aka Han- and Showcase
nah Montana) and tween Disney
pop star Demi Lovalo, the
Jonas Brothers have exploded from the family-
friendly mold into superstardom.

Their movie, which is presumptuously
labeled a "Concert Experience," is more or
less a standard concert film shot in 3D. It goes
without saying that to compare the Jonas's film
to Scorsese's "The Last Waltz" or Jonathan
Demme's "Stop Making Sense" would be like
comparing a tricycle to a Jaguar. The brothers
perform their hit songs with high energy and
elaborate production, but the band's enthusi-
asm is pretty much all there is to speak of. The
music written for them has been played a few
too many times to still sound fresh.
Infrequent cutaways to documentary foot-
age show snippets of the brothers' individual
personalities. It's hard to say whether these
segments are real or staged, which further
speaks to the overwhelming degree to which
the whole ball of wax is contrived, constructed
and sold.
True to their manufactured family-friendly
image, the Jonas Brothers outwardly promote
positive values. A family of evangelical Chris-
tians, each member wears a chastity ring on
his left hand, signifying their promise to God
to abstain from premarital sex as well as drug
and alcohol use. Knowing this, it was confus-
ing (or rather mind-blowing) to see overt sex-

ual imagery pervade the movie. At one point,
the Jonas boys put down their instruments
and pick up foam guns, blasting a whiteish
substance at an audience of screaming ado-
lescent girls. It's pretty appalling, especially
as a gesture allegedly in the name of positive
values.
Another unintentionally nocuous element
of the movie is the presence of the boys' body-
guard Big Rob. He comes out on stage for one
song as a hype man, but then is quickly dis-
missed backstage. In the documented footage,
he is the comic relief, though the laughs are
sometimes uneasy. As the black, obese giant
paired with the three cute pop stars, there is
the sense that Rob is not so much a bodyguard
as he is an accessory.
In addition to the Big Rob uneasiness, fans
standing in line make a blatantly racist joke,
and it didn't go over well with the man who
was the butt of the joke or this reviewer.
"Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experi-
ence" will likely entertain and satisfy far more
than it should. However, its slim 76-minute
runtime can't keep the movie and the idea
behind the Jonas Brothers from feelingly over-
ly manufactured and extremely bland.

MTV's new "See You Sunday"
lineup, composed of four new
shows,ispredict-
ably filled with See You
cursing, sopho-
moric humor, unday
stunts and shaky 9p.m. Sundays
camerawork. MTV
One thing it does
not have, how-
ever, is music videos (which, ironi-
cally, has become the norm with
MTV). And that's too bad, because
the lineup doesn't really break
away from anything MTV has
done lately. The last show, "How's
Your News?," seems poised to veer
off to greener pastures, but other-
wise, it's the same old shindig.
First up is "Rob Dyrdek's Fan-
tasy Factory," which features Rob
from MTV's "Rob & Big" and, you
guessed it, his fantasy factory: a
25,000 square-foot warehouse that
has been converted into a concrete
skateboarding paradise. Doting on
Rob is his cousin and new personal
assistant, Drama. Drama works at
the skateboarding headquarters
alongwiththelawyer, manager and
graphic artist of Rob's skateboard-
ing empire, Dyrdek Enterprises.
Rob definitely has a blast mak-
ing his fantasy a reality, whether
he's driving his Campagna T-Rex
(a three-wheeled racecar) or
wearing stilts for a one-on-one
game of basketball against pro-
fessional basketball player Lamar
Odom. The real star of the show,
however, is the fantasy factory
itself, which is filled with skate-
board ramps, foam pits and even a
blob (a massive partially-inflated
balloon intended to launch a per-
son into the air). But the novelty
will soon wear off, and there's a
limit to how many contraptions
Rob can wheel out. An episode of
"Cribs" dedicated to Rob's. play-
ground would've sufficed.
Next on the lineup is "The Col-
legeHumor Show," a sitcom about
the professional lives of those
responsible for the popular Inter-
net comedy site CollegeHumor.
com. The show was written and
shot by the CollegeHumor team,
who are also the show's stars.
Contained within each episode
are short videos straight from the
website, which are usually played
right before commercial breaks.
While the show maintains an

authentic CollegeHumor feel, the
staff's poor acting doesn't cut it
for the half-hour show. There are,
however, moments of extreme
hilarity - the team, after all, is
made up of the geniuses behind
the "Fresh Prince Theme: Gang-
sta Version."
Filling the third slot in the line-
up is "Nitro Circus." Produced by
"Jackass" star Johnny Knoxville
and "Jackass" executive produc-
er Jeff Tremaine, it is basically
"Jackass" on wheels. Professional
motocross rider Travis Pastrana
and several other lesser-known
extreme sportsmen (and sports-
woman) performdangerousstunts
on whatever rolling object they
can get their hands on. Motorcy-
MTV sticks
with its old,
boring antics.
cles, bicycles and tricycles are the
most common. When they can't
find anything with wheels, they
get out the old Slip 'N Slide or go
skydiving without parachutes.
The problem is that Travis Pas-
tranaandfriendslack the anarchic
enthusiasm of the "Jackass" crew.
Their objective is to do a back flip
on a Big Wheel tricycle or to get as
much air from a Slip 'N Slide jump
as possible, not to piss people off.
Finally, "How's Your News?"
features a team of reporters with
disabilitiesconductinginterviews.
It's difficult to say whether or not
the show's premise is condescend-
ing to its reporters, but it's clear
that the "How's Your News?"
team is having a great time, so
what does it matter?
The reporters talk to people
right on the sidewalk about any-
thing and everything,-but their
interviews with celebrities are the
highlight of the show. They inter-
view Miley Cyrus, Jimmy Kim-
mel, Sarah Silverman and many
others. John Stamos even volun-
teers to give one of the reporters a
lesson in picking up women, then
plays the reporter's wingman for
the day. "How's Your News" is the
most promising of the entire MTV
Sunday lineup.
"See You Sunday"? Maybe.

A Cyclone' of western sounds

By JACK PORTER
Daily Arts Writer
Three years have passed since
Neko Case's soph-
omore-effort-cum-
breakout-success
Fox Confessor Neko Case
Brings the Flood
introduced thou- Middle Cyclone
sands to her fiery ANTI-
strain of alt-coun-
try songcraft.
Whilehersoundisfarremovedfrom
the syrupy twang of mainstream
country artists like Garth Brooks,
her sun-bleached guitar solos and
fills still lend a sense of western
ambiance to her work. Rife with
striking imagery and vocal pyro-
technics, Middle Cyclone is a wor-
thy addition to Case's accomplished
musical catalogue, even if it's one of
her least consistent efforts.
"This Tornado Loves You" starts
the album with a creative master
stroke that narrates an unrequited
romance between a natural disas-
ter and a human being. Case's lyr-


ARTS IN BRIEF

ics are charming: "I have waited /
with a glacier's patience / Smashed
every transformer / with every
trailer /'till nothing was standing."
A brisk palm-muted acoustic guitar
strum drivesthetrack forward with
appropriategale force, and pizzicato
splashes add color to the mix.
Case's penchant for personi-
fication extends into first single,
"People Got A Lotta Nerve," which
includes references to elephants,
sharks and killer whales. Playfully,
she chides a broken-hearted dupe:
"I'm a man eater / but you're still
surprised when I eat ya." Tambou-
rine shakes and major scale guitar
riffs paint cheery scenery for Case's
boyish alto.
Her vocals are granted more
room for play in "Vengeance Is
Sleeping." Quiet piano taps dot the
simple acoustic guitar progressions,
and Case coos and caws between the
folds. She manages some impres-
sive dynamic and tonal leaps with
her aching voice, and even handles
her cracks with grace. Fittingly, the
final words refer back to her some-
named Candy (Keshia Knight Pul-
liam, "Beauty Shop") that he knew
in college. And with these amaz-
ing plot tools of his, Tyler Perry
makes a whopping $42 million on
opening weekend for what may be
his crappiest film to date.
A depressing drama as well as
cheap comedy, "Madea" throws
everything but the kitchen sink onto
the screen. The film goes through
manipulative depictions of sex and
drug abuse, then mixes in misguid-
ed Christianity. "Meet the Browns"
and "Why Did I Get Married?" were
at least sincere in their sappiness.
Perry doesn't deserve all the low
ratings he musters on IMDB, but
"Madea Goes to Jail" is a wreck.
Positive values are just that much
harder to impart when Derek Luke
is bawling his eyes out and Rudy
from "The Cosby Show" is playing
a tangerine-haired hooker. Maybe
Perry's 43rd movie in the next 10
years will be an outstanding and
all-appealing masterwork. Without
Madea.

could discourage listeners with its

"Madea Goes To Jail"

At Quality 16 and Showcase
Madea, that broad-shouldered,
big-mouthed grandma from Geor-
gia, is back. Again. And as always,
she's the showboat in Tyler Perry's
("Meet the Browns") latest work,
"Madea Goes To Jail." While the
Madea movies may be Perry's big-
gest commercial successes, this
installment is still the same old
Perry doing the same old thing.
There are really only two things
to say about the film. First: Madea
(Perry in drag) is sentenced to
prison, only to preach to people
about taking responsibility for
their actions. Second: Joshua
(Derek Luke, "Notorious") is an
attorney protecting a prostitute

Importance of Minnesota game not
lost on'M' as Big Dance draws near

By JASON KOHLER
Daily Sports Writer
Manny Harris's television is
almost always set to ESPN.
But when a segment about NCAA
Tournament bubble teams comes on
the screen, the sophomore forward
quickly switches the channel.
"You try not to think about it or
put that much pressure on yourself,
but it's going
to stay in your
head," Harris Michigan at
said. "You just Minnesota
kind of got to
relax and free Matchup: Michi-
your mind. It's gan 18-12; Min-
hard to do." nesota 21-8

wherever the day 12 P.M.
Michigan Where:

surrounded by thegame.blogs.
one question: michigandaily.com
Will the Wol-
verines make
the NCAA Tournament?
Michigan (8-9 Big Ten, 18-12
overall) is among a handful of teams
fighting for one of 34 at-large bids to
the Big Dance. It could also lock up
an automatic bid by winning next
weekend's Big Ten Tournament.
Fifth-year senior guard C.J.
Lee has noticed more students
approaching him on campus asking

him about the team and its tourna-
ment prospects.
According to ESPN, the Wolver-
ines are ranked 47th in RPI and 11th
in strength of schedule.
But most prognosticators have
Michigan out of the tournament.
The Wolverines appear in just 13
brackets on Bracketproject.50webs.
com, which compiles a matrix of 60
projected brackets.
Michigan coach John Beil-
ein tries to avoid the media hoopla
heading up to Selection Sunday, but
even he has been monitoring other
bubble team's games.
And Wednesday was a good day
for the Wolverines.Five bubble teams
- Boston College, Florida, Kentucky,
Miami and Virginia Tech - lost.
"When you watch those scores
yesterday, however the scores went
yesterday, I would still say the same
thing in the locker room today,"
Beilein said. "'That was a great day
yesterday for Michigan basketball.
Just keep moving. Just keep getting
better.' "
The Wolverines have a chance
to impress the NCAA Selection
Committee on Saturday in what
boils down to an elimination game
against Minnesota.
A win would lock the Wolverines
in as the seventh seed in the Big Ten
Tournament, where they'd likely
play Iowa in the first round. If they
advance to the second round, they
would play No. 19 Purdue or No. 23
Illinois.

A loss won't completely kill the
Wolverines' postseason dreams,
but they will likely need a few wins
in the conference tournament to
improve their chances of making
the Big Dance. A loss to the Golden
Gophers would give Michigan an
No. 8 seed in the conference tour-
nament and a first-round matchup
with Northwestern. If the Wolver-
ines beat the Wildcats, they would
play Big Ten regular season cham-
pion Michigan State.
"It's a regular-season game, but
there's a lot on the line," Lee said.
"That's what you cometo college for,
to play in games like that. We want
to treat every game at this point like
a big game."
Beilein, who usually avoids focus-
ing on the importance of a single
game, admitted that Saturday is a
critical match for the Wolverines.
But he also said he's happy to be
in the hunt to make the tournament.
Last season, Michigan went 10-22
with no shot of any postseason play.
The Wolverines have stressed all
season thatcnothing shortof making
the NCAA Tournament will remove
last year's sour memories.
That's why there is so much more
added pressure on the Wolverines.
"We know where we are, and we
know where we stand," Lee said.
"That's not something to shy away
from or be scared about, so we all
know where we stand and what we
need to do to get to where we want
to go."

Sophomore Manny Harris and the Wolverines aren't included in most NCAA
Tournament projections, but a win at Minnesota tomorrow could change that.

the Wolverines, who ended
on on an eight-game losing
Michigan led or was tied late
s 16 losses to Big Ten teams,
g last night's game.
5-loss regular-season con-

ference slate evokes memories of
three seasons ago, when the pro-
gram went 0-16 in Big Ten play.
A year later, Michigan hired
Borseth, who promised he would
establish a tradition of women's bas-
ketballinAnnArbor. The Wolverines
responded with a 19-win season and
a trip to the WNIT quarterfinals.
But this season, Michigan strug-
gled to finish games.
"I don't even know how many
games we were either close or
tied with just a few minutes left in
the game," freshman point guard
Courtney Boylan said. "We just
couldn't close them out. We couldn't
all season."
Against Indiana, the Wolverines
dominated the first 25 minutes.
Michigan started the game with a
12-0 run and held the Hoosiers (12-

7, 19-9) scoreless for the first seven
minutes ofthe game. The large Indi-
ana contingent of fans who was only
an hour away from Bloomington
was mostly quiet.
Junior center Krista Phillips pen-
etrated the paint and usedherheight
to score 13 points in the game's first
25 minutes. And senior forward
Carly Benson made three 3-pointers
in the same time frame.
But with the pressure on from the
Indiana press, Benson and Phillips
scored a combined two points in the
game's final 15 minutes.
"We couldn't figure it out," senior
point guard Jessica Minnfield said.
"Our passes were either too short or
too long, and we couldn't even get
the ball on our side of the court. It
was frustrating."
At one point, the pressure caused

three consecutive turnovers on the
Wolverines' side of the court and a
momentum swing from which they
couldn't recover.
"That was the entire game - the
press," Borseth said with his head
in his hands. "It was all about the
press."
With a long offseason ahead,
Borseth will need to retool a frus-
trated team that will lose four
seniors, three of them starters.
"It'sgoing to go in the right direc-
tion," Borseth said. "This might
have been a step backwards. But I
look at where it was two years ago,
and there were a lot of games where
the program never had a chance.
And this season, there weren't many
games that we weren't in.
"It's going to work. It's only a
matter of time before it happens."

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
Borseth
responsible
for Blue's
mental state
INDIANAPOLIS -
The stigma followed the
Michigan women's bas-
ketball team like a dark
cloud every game.
The Wolverines couldn't
close games. After three tough
losses in a
row earlier in JOE
the season - STAPLETON
to Wisconsin,
Michigan On women's
State and basketball
Minnesota
- it became worrisome. Why
couldn't they finish?
It was a self-fulfilling proph-
ecy. Michigan was identified as
a team that struggled down the
stretch, and eventually, it was
how the Wolverines identified
themselves.
"You try not to think about
it, but you can't help it," senior
forward Carly Benson said. "It's
hard to get over so many things
that didn't go our way all year."
This mentality caused Michi-
gan to break down in close
game after close game this
season, ending with last night's
68-50 loss to Indiana in the first
round of the Big Ten Tourna-
ment in Indianapolis.
The games followed a dis-
tinct blueprint: The Wolverines
would play very well early.
Then, something bad happened
(missed shots piled up, the
other team implemented a full-
court press, etc.), and they got
down on themselves.
"This year, we just couldn't
finish games," junior center
Krista Phillips said. "I think
our biggest goal for next year is
going to be finishing games."
The Wolverines' late-game
problems caused late-season
problems. Michigan ended the
year on an eight-game losing
skid
It started the season 7-4 and
beat two ranked teams in that
span, but they opened Big Ten
season with a 20-point loss
to Ohio State and it didn't get
much better from there.
Michigan had six- and seven-
game losing streaks in confer-
ence play and finished 3-16
against Big Ten teams.
The way the Wolverines fin-
ished their season mirrored the
way they finished games, but
it didn't have to. They had the
players to hang with any team
in the conference. They proved
it by playing so many teams so
close.
And their loss yesterday was
a microcosm of their season.
Their problem was mental.
At times, it was amazing how
quickly they could be taken out
of games mentally. After Indi-
ana implemented its full-court
press early in the second half
and turned Michigan's 12-point
lead into a six-point advantage
of its own, you could almost see
the Wolverines wilt.

At that point, the six-point
deficit might as well have been
600.
And that problem is coach-
able. It's Michigan coach Kevin
Borseth's job to make sure his
team is mentally ready for every
game. This season, there were
times it clearly wasn't.
When asked what he needed
to do to stop his team from get-
ting down on itself, he seemed
like he hadn't given the men-
tal aspect of the game much
thought.
"You got to be able to dribble
around somebody," he said.
"This isn't rocket science."
Maybe not. But that wasn't
the issue.
This wasn't a mentally weak
group, but losing so many times
in so many close games will
make any team question its own
ability. And it's the coach's job
to make sure that doesn't hap-
pen.
Borseth didn't.
He knows the Xs and Os as
well as anyone and is a good
recruiter. But if he doesn't
become more aware of his
team's mental state, he can look
forward to more seasons like
this one.
The players don't deserve
that, and neither do the fans.
"You have got to be able to
score in this game," Borseth
said. It was his last comment of
the press conference.
That's true. But your athletes
also need to know they can.

For Saturday, March 7, 2009
ARIES
(March 21 to April 19)
Something having to do with group
activities could be confusing today.
Perhaps someone will give you the
wrong instructions or directions.
Alternatively, you might want to help
someone.
TAURUS
(April 20 to May 20)
Although you're quite ambitious now,
make sure you know what you're going
after today. Something could cloud your
judgment. Be careful.
GEMINI
(May 21 to June 20)
Double-check travel plans today.
Don't go out on a limb, especially
regarding arguments about politics, reli-
gion and racial issues. If you're involved
in higher education, make sure your
information is correct and up to date.
CANCER
(June 21to July 22)
Because you feel sympathetic to oth-
ers, you're willing to share jointly held
resources. You also might want to do
fundraising or work on behalfof charita-
ble causes.
LEO
(July 23 to Aug. 22)
Relations with partners and close
friends are confusing today. You get the
sense that someone wants something,
but you're not sure what it is.
VIRGO
(Aug. 23 to Sept. 22)
Be extra clear in your actions and your
words with co-workers and superiors at
work today. Don't make people second-
guess what you're doing or what you
want. Make sure they understand.
LIBRA
(Sept. 23 to Oct. 22)
Don't overdo things if you're partying
today. It's easy to overindulge in drink
and food. Don't let this get out of hand.
Be clear in all matters related to chil-

dren.
SCORPIO
(Oct. 23 to Nov. 21)
Conversations with family members
are like two ships passing in the night.
Misunderstandings can arrive simply
due to genuine misinterpretation. Never
assume. (Not today.)
SAGITTARIUS
(Nov. 22 to Dec. 21)
You might go off on a tangent or be
gung-ho about something and later find
you don't have all the facts straight. Be
sure about your facts.
CAPRICORN
(Dec. 22to Jan. 19)
Financial matters can be confusing
and uneasy today. Avoid important
financial decisions today. If you think
someone is not on the level, you're
probably right!
AQUARIUS
(Jan. 20 to Feb. 18)
You're enthusiastic and gung-ho right
now; nevertheless, you might not have
all your facts correct. Make sure you
know what you're doing. Easy does it.
PISCES
(Feb. 19 to March 20)
Something secretive or even deceptive
could be going on today. Someone is
working behind the scenes, and this
someone could be you!
YOU BORN TODAY You're very
sensitive and giving. Many of you are
unusually psychic or dialed in to the
energy of the universe and the energy of
others. Because of this, you often go
around something rather than meet it
head-on. This doesn'tumean you avoid it;
it means you approach things obliquely.
You have a lot to give to the world in
terms of compassion, talent and caring.
An important choice awaits you this
year. Choose wisely.
