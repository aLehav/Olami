For LSA junior Ryan Bennett, 
the High Achieving Involved 
Leader scholarship was the 
deciding factor in his decision 
to apply to the University of 
Michigan. 
Before receiving the large, 
embellished mailing from the 

University in his junior year 
of high school commending 
his 
academic 
achievements 
and encouraging him to apply, 
Bennett had not considered 
U-M. Finding out he could 
receive four years of free tuition 
changed Bennet’s mind.
“My eyes weren’t even set 
on Michigan yet, because I 
knew I wanted to do film, so I 

was just looking at schools out 
west,” Bennett said. “I ended 
up getting a package in the mail 
from U of M that I didn’t even 
open up. Later on, a couple of 
weeks after I got it, I decided 
to open it up and learned that 
I got the HAIL stuff, and it 
was obviously a life-changing 
experience because it turned 
my eyes onto Michigan. I 

learned about how I could make 
my interests come to fruition 
there, and ultimately, it was 
the scholarship that made a big 
impact on my choice to go here.”
In collaboration with the 
University, 
the 
National 
Bureau of Economic Research 
published a report analyzing 
the success of the HAIL — a

The Michigan Daily: An FBI 
report found the University of 
Michigan to have the second-
highest number of reported 
hate crimes of 110 public and 
private universities surveyed in 
2017. The report claimed there 
were 15 hate crimes reported at 
the Ann Arbor campus, while 
the 
Dearborn 
campus 
and 
Michigan State University only 
reported one hate crime. While 
the increase in reporting hate 
crimes may come from students’ 
familiarity and willingness to 
disclose them to the University, 
some students are still frustrated 
with the University’s inadequate 
responses to bias incidents on 
campus. What do you think

Emory professor discusses relationship 
between heart disease and discrimination

SARAH KUNKEL/Daily
Emory University Epidemiology professor Tene T. Lewis speaks about discriminator stressors and early markers of cardiovascular disease in African-American women during the Race, Health, and 
Wealth Disparities seminar series at the Institute for Social Research Monday.

Tene Lewis says African-American women’s cardic health decline is linked to racial discrimination

Dr. 
Tene 
Lewis, 
a 
University of Michigan alum 
and professor at the Rollins 
School of Public Health at 
Emory 
University, 
spoke 
Monday on the relationship 
between discrimination and 
cardiovascular disease among 
African-American 
women. 
The 
presentation 
was 
the 
first in the Research Center 
for Group Dynamics seminar 
series, 
in 
which 
notable 
researchers 
speak 
about 
interdisciplinary social issues 
like race.
Lewis 
opened 
her 
talk 

by describing her field of 
interest, 
which 
combines 
psychology, 
epidemiology 
and cardiology. Her research 
centers around poor health 
outcomes within the African-
American 
community 
as 
opposed to other racial and 
ethnic groups.
“If you are born African-
American in this country, 
you will live sicker and die 
younger 
than 
your 
white 
counterparts,” Lewis said.
Lewis 
focused 
on 
the 
relationship between reported 
accounts 
of 
racism 
and 
discrimination from African 
Americans and indications of 
poor 
cardiovascular 
health 

such 
as 
coronary 
artery 
calcium, which hardens the 
walls of the arteries.
“Chronic 
reports 
of 
everyday 
discrimination 
are 
associated 
with 
the 
occurrence of coronary artery 
calcium in African Americans 
and not whites,” Lewis said.
Lewis 
said 
racial 
discrimination 
impacting 
African 
American 
woman, 
causes 
unhealthy 
plaque 
buildup inside the artery wall 
called carotid atherosclerosis.
“The 
more 
expectations 
of racism women had, the 
more carotid atherosclerosis 
they had,” Lewis said. “For 
whatever reason, reports of 

racism experiences weren’t 
as strongly associated with 
outcomes in African-American 
women.”
Public 
Health 
doctoral 
student 
Traci 
Carson 
expressed interest in the study 
after the event. Carson said 
she wants to delve further into 
combating the physical effects 
of discrimination.
“I’m really interested in 
the physiological stress work 
that she does even though 
my research is a different 
area,” Carson said. “I’ve been 
really inspired by Tene’s work 
because of my colleagues in 
public health who do work 
really specific to her field.”

Despite 
the 
consistent 
negative 
effects 
of 
discrimination in relation to 
cardiovascular health, Lewis 
said the overall levels of 
reported discrimination were 
lower than expected. It is 
unclear whether the levels are 
lower due to a lack of reporting 
or an actual decrease in racist 
incidents.
“Across studies, reports of 
discrimination are actually 
relatively low,” Lewis said. 
“On 
average, 
people 
are 
not reporting a lot of these 
experiences.”
Lewis 
further 
explained 
her discovery that everyday 
discrimination may not impact

SACUA discusses due process rights

The 
Senate 
Advisory 
Committee on University 
Affairs 
met 
Monday 
to 
discuss a diverse agenda, 
including 
upcoming 
elections and faculty due 
process protections.
SACUA 
Chair 
Neil 
Marsh, 
professor 
of 
chemistry, 
asked 
the 
committee to brainstorm 
ways to recruit University 
of Michigan faculty to run 
for positions on SACUA 
this spring. There are three 
outgoing SACUA members, 
two of whom will serve on 
a nominating committee 
for 
the 
new 
committee 
members. 
Marsh’s 
goal 
is to have at least six 
members 
of 
the 
Senate 
Assembly, the University’s 
largest 
governing 
body, 

run to replace them.
Tom Schneider, director 
of 
the 
Faculty 
Senate 
Office, described some of 
the 
ongoing 
difficulties 
SACUA 
faces, 
including 
a 
lack 
of 
membership 
interest. 
Schneider 
said 
he hoped new procedures 
would 
make 
membership 
less 
of 
a 
commitment. 
The 
Senate 
Assembly 
is 
currently 
working 
on 
mechanisms for electronic 
voting to facilitate “remote 
participation” in committee 
meetings.
SACUA Vice Chair Joy 
Beatty, associate professor 
of organizational behavior 
at U-M Dearborn, suggested 
reaching out to the Senate 
Assembly’s 
Information 
Technolog y Committee to 
streamline the development 
and implementation of the 
aforementioned technolog y. 

SACUA member Michael 
Atzmon, 
professor 
of 
nuclear engineering and 
radiological 
sciences, 
acknowledged 
the 
outdated 
bylaws 
which 

call for the electorate to 
be physically present at 
meetings.
“Those 
are 
philosophical 
things 
that either we or the 
Senate Assembly should 
be discussing,” Atzmon 
said.
The 
committee 
moved on to discuss a 
new policy to protect 
governing 
faculty’s 
due process rights as 
University staff because 
there 
are 
different 
procedures 
among 
lecturers, 
graduate 
student 
instructors 
and faculty. Lecturers 
and GSIs are not under 
the Senate Assembly’s 
control.
“I believe there are 
stronger protections for 
undergraduates … than 
there 
are 
for 
faculty 
and staff,” Atzmon said. 
“All 
members 
of 
the 
community 
should 
be 

afforded the same level 
of protection.”
SACUA member Sarah 
Lippert, 
associate 
professor of art history 
at U-M Flint, revealed 
inconsistencies 
in 
procedures 
across 
the 
University’s campuses.
“We know that there 
are 
faculty 
struggling 
with 
receiving 
due 
process 
on 
all 
three 
campuses,” Lippert said.
Atzmon 
mentioned 
this policy’s relevancy 
in 
light 
of 
recent 
controversy surrounding 
Associate 
Prof. 
John 
Cheney-Lippold’s 
refusal to write a letter 
of 
recommendation 
for a student applying 
to 
study 
abroad 
in 
Israel. SACUA released 
a 
statement 
Oct. 
22 
supporting 
professors’ 
right to refuse students’ 
letter requests, saying 
persecution of Cheney-
Lippold sets a dangerous 
precedent 
and 
stunts 
professors’ 
freedom 
to 
provide 
their 
endorsement of students 
as they so choose.
SACUA member Bill 
Schultz, 
professor 
of 
mechanical engineering, 
said he believes a due 
process 
policy 
would 
be helpful in the wake 
of this controversy. He 
stressed the urgency of 
putting one into place.
“We’d like to think 
we aren’t breaking new 
ground 
here,” 
Schultz 
said.
SACUA 
adopted 
the Principles of Due 
Process resolution, and 
it will be presented at 
the 
upcoming 
Senate 
Assembly 
meeting 

“I believe there are 
always stronger 
protections for 
undergraduates... 
than there are for 
faculty and staff. 
All members of 
the community 
should be afforded 
the same level of

Abbas family, Dingell proposed 
the Abbas Stop Drunk Driving 
Act, in honor of the family.
The 
Abbas 
Stop 
Drunk 
Driving Act would require the 
Department of Transportation 
to set a federal motor vehicle 
safety 
standard 
that 
would 
require all new vehicles to 
be equipped with an ignition 
interlock device (IID). If the bill 
is passed, automakers would be 
required to meet this standard 
within a year.
On the House floor, Dingell 
spoke 
on 
how 
terrible 
the 
tragedy was and how passing 
the legislation will prevent other 
accidents of its kind.
“This week, I’m introducing 
legislation in memory of the 
Abbas 
family 
that 
would 
mandate 
all 
new 
vehicles 
be 
equipped 
with 
interlock 
breathalyzer devices,” Dingell 
said. “This will stop intoxicated 
drivers from ever starting a 
vehicle and keep them off the 
roads. If we can keep one person 
from dying on the roads and 
make people think twice before 

getting behind the wheel when 
they shouldn’t — even when they 
are buzzed and think they’ll be 
okay — then won’t we have been 
successful?”
Katie Kelly, communications 
director for the University’s 
chapter of College Democrats, 
stated 
she 
is 
confident 
in 
Dingell’s propositions to create 
safer roads.
“Congresswoman 
Dingell 
is one of the hardest-working 
individuals in Congress. If she 
sets her mind to something, 
she will find a way to get it 
done,” Kelly said. “I believe 
Congresswoman Dingell’s bill, 
once implemented, will save 
countless lives and make our 
roads safer.”
Kelly 
continued 
to 
say 
setting this standard will be a 
progressive move for Detroit, 
the automotive capital.
“Michigan has always been 
the center of the automotive 
industry,” 
Kelly 
said. 
“This 
bill would continue the legacy 
of automotive leadership that 
Michigan is known for.”
Lincoln 
Merrill, 
communications 
director 
for 
the 
University’s 
chapter 
of 
College Republicans, agrees that 
the ignition interlock devices 

have been implemented and 
successful in curbing drunk 
driving in various states, but a 
national bill would possibly raise 
some issues.
“It 
is 
difficult 
to 
obtain 
accurate measurements without 
inconveniencing the operator in 
order to satisfy six sigma industry 
standards 
(meaning 
99.9966 
percent of samples would be 
accurate),” Merrill said. “While 
clearly 
beneficial 
in 
theory, 
universal implementation raises 
some new issues with logistics, 
quality management and wide 
consumer acceptance.”
Merrill also brought up how 
privacy laws and how mandating 
a universal IID law would 
unnecessarily affect millions of 
users. 
“I think this is an argument 
of how far we are willing to go 
giving up specific freedoms, in 
this case not having to effectively 
use a breathalyzer every time 
we operate a car, in order to 
in theory support something 
bigger,” Merrill said. “Is drunk 
driving and the accidents that 
come with it an awful thing? Yes, 
of course it is. But I’m not sure 
that this specific bill is the way 
to go when thinking about how it 
unnecessarily affects hundreds 

of millions of people.”
Washtenaw County Sheriff 
Jerry Clayton fully supports the 
bill, and brings up how drugged 
driving has been an increasing 
issue, and how an IID alone 
would not solve this issue.
“Drugged 
driving 
is 
a 
growing problem,” Clayton said. 
“Especially as drivers recognize 
that a really good party is as 
simple as a Xanax and 2 beers, 
then we’re right back to the same 
problem but without the illegal 
breath alcohol concentration. 
We’d still have to do roadside 
sobriety evaluations, processing 
impaired drivers and cleaning 
up the crashes.”
Clayton 
agrees 
the 
bill 
would be a beneficial first step 
to curbing drunk driving but 
expects other related issues will 
need to be addressed in the near 
future.
“I fully support the spirit 
of 
Congresswoman 
Dingell’s 
proposed bill,” Clayton said. “It 
is devastating every time we 
experience loss of life as a result 
of drunk or drugged driving. I 
think the idea has merit and is a 
good start. 

scholarship aimed to help low-
income, high-achieving students 
attend the University without 
having to worry about paying 
school tuition. Researchers found 
targeted students were twice as 
likely to both apply and enroll 
at the University than those 
students not contacted.
“We find very large effects of 
the HAIL scholarship offer on 
application and enrollment rates 
at the University of Michigan and 
more generally on college choice,” 
the report reads. “The likelihood 
of application to the University 
of Michigan more than doubled, 
from 26 percent among controls 
to 67 percent among students 
offered treatment. The share 
enrolling at any highly selective 
college more than doubled, from 
13 perfect to 28 percent, with 
this effect operating completely 
through enrollment at University 
of Michigan.”
As 
a 
field 
experiment, 
researchers wanted to analyze 
whether or not targeting specific 
students who were low-income 
and 
high-achieving 
would 
increase their application rate, 
as well as the enrollment rate. 
After finding notable increases in 
both rates, the study concluded 
encouragement for these students 
to apply to the University, as well 
as a promise of financial aid, 
could assist in increasing the 
numbers of low-socioeconomic-
status students at the University.
Two groups of students were 
analyzed. The first were the 

“treated” 
students, 
students 
targeted 
by 
the 
University 
through 
elaborate 
mailings 
and letters, encouraging them 
to apply to the University and 
guaranteeing a scholarship to 
cover their entire tuition should 
they 
be 
admitted. 
Packets 
received by families included a 
letter from University President 
Mark Schlissel encouraging the 
student to apply, a flyer describing 
the 
application 
process, 
brochures about the University 
and fee-waiving coupons for the 
Common Application, the FAFSA 
and the CSS profile. 
The second group was the 
control group. Students in this 
cohort receive the mailings and 
were treated the way they would 
have been a few years ago before 
the idea of HAIL was realized. 
According to the study, the goal 
of HAIL was to address common 
problems low-income students 
face when applying to college in 
high school.
“The intervention, the ‘HAIL 
Scholarship,’ was designed to 
address three issues that research 
shows affect the college choices 
of low-income, high-achieving 
students: uncertainty about their 
suitability for an elite school, 
over-estimates of the (net) cost of 
college, and procedural barriers 
such as financial aid forms,” the 
report reads. 
Susan 
Dynarski, 
public 
policy professor and researcher 
of college tuition policy, said 
students who could attend the 
University simply do not apply 
because they believe they cannot 
afford the tuition. The goal of 
HAIL was to change this idea.

“Many 
promising 
students 
across Michigan don’t know 
how 
affordable 
an 
excellent 
school can be, so they don’t 
bother applying for admission or 
aid,” Dynarski said. “The HAIL 
Scholarship sends a powerful 
message that this world-class 
university is open to Michigan’s 
talented students, regardless of 
their income.”
In an interview with The Daily, 
Schlissel 
commented 
on 
the 
success of HAIL in bringing more 
low-income and first-generation 
students to the school. HAIL 
lent a new type of outreach for 
the University to students from 
all over Michigan, and he hopes 
this will increase the University’s 
reputation as an outstanding 
educational opportunity.
“The 
HAIL 
Scholarship 
program 
really 
completely 
revolutionized the way we reach 
out to people in different parts 
of 
the 
Michigan 
economy,” 
Schlissel said. “The early data 
— it’s only been one admissions 
cycle — but this year’s freshman 
class has increased its fraction 
of 
first-generation 
students, 
has 
increased 
its 
representation 
of 
students 
from 
the 
lower 
socioeconomic 
quadrants or quintiles of the 
economy and it’s exceeded our 
expectations and we’re going to 
stick with it. And not only that, 
the study got national attention.”
In its first year, HAIL brought 
in 
262 
low-income, 
in-state 
students, each receiving four 
years of tuition covered — totaling 
about $60,000 in scholarship 
money per student. According to 

the study, these students would 
have been eligible for the free 
tuition whether or not HAIL 
existed. Eligible rising seniors 
were notified through elaborate 
maize 
and 
blue 
emblazoned 
mailings in high school, and 
parents and principals received 
letters commending the students’ 
academic achieving and notifying 
of the opportunity for free 
tuition.
The study reports a difference 
between schools that higher- 
versus lower-income students 
choose 
when 
applying 
and 
enrolling 
in 
college. 
Despite 
having 
the 
same 
academic 
success, lower-income students 
are less likely to attend similar 
universities 
to 
their 
higher-
income counterparts.
“Among 
students 
whose 
academic 
achievement 
makes 
them 
plausible 
candidates 
for 
University 
of 
Michigan, 
low-income students are four 
percentage points less likely 
to attend any postsecondary 
institution than their similarly-
qualified, higher-income peers,” 
the report reads. “Gaps in college 
selectivity are yet wider than 
gaps 
in 
college 
attendance: 
low-income 
students 
are 
8 
percentage points less likely to 
attend a highly selective (e.g. the 
University of Michigan) or most 
selective institution.”
According to the study, more 
selective institutions can usually 
give more financial aid to students 
than less selective schools.

Cofounder 
Nick 
Lemmer says the Nickels Arcade 
offers the perfect opportunity to 
reach a new community with a lot 
of surrounding activity. 
“Nickels Arcade is such a 
unique place in the landscape of 
downtown Ann Arbor,” Lemmer 
says. “It has an eclectic mix of 
retail shops that work so well 
together to create an awesome 
all-in-one shopping destination. 
We are trying to give businesses 

that don’t have a downtown 
presence the ability to get their 
brands and tasty food in front of 
all the different types of people 
that frequent downtown. If our 
members are successful, the 
collective is successful.”
Backed by a team of Ann 
Arbor residents and University 
of Michigan alumni, the staff 
has a wide variety of work 
experience in the food industry. 
Constellation 
Collective 
has 
several co-founders, including 
Max Steir, founder and owner of 
Salads UP; Alex Perlman, former 
music festival food cart operator 
for The Beet Box and Cheese 
Dream; Jared Hoffman, partner 
of Salads UP; as well as Lemmer, 
a cofounder of Ioria’s Gelateria.
Public Health alum Danielle 
Butbul, director of community 
relations 
for 
Constellation 
Collective, said the Collective 
will be holding regular lunchtime 
pop-ups in collaboration with 
other food businesses. The pop-
ups are recurring events and are 
expected to begin as early as next 
week.
“We have several lunchtime 
pop-ups in the works with 
Harvest 
Kitchen 
and 
Pilar’s 

Tamales,” Butbul said. “During 
these pop-ups, customers will 
be able to come by and grab a 
fresh, warm and quick meal 
served by the hosting company. 
We also hope to collaborate with 
our neighbors in the arcade to 
activate the space for 
larger 
community 
events.”
LSA 
sophomore 
Marley Duerst maintains a vegan 
diet and believes she will benefit 
from the market because of their 
variety of gluten-free and vegan-
friendly options. She hopes it 
will be a convenient place to grab 
quick and healthy food.
“I think it’s really exciting 
that there is a place located so 
centrally on campus,” Duerst 
said. “Easily accessible fresh food 
is hard to come by in a downtown 
area, 
so 
I’m 
really 
looking 
forward to trying out this place. I 
try not to eat processed food, and 
I love eating produce, so it will 
be nice to have such a convenient 
place to get it.”
With just a full week since 
their regular hours began, Butbul 
said the business has drawn 
significant local attention.
“Within 
the 
first 
week, 

we’ve received so much love, 
encouragement and even received 
flowers from our neighbors at 
the 
University 
Flower 
Shop 
and Bivouac,” Butbul said. “We 
managed to sell out of most of 
our members’ food and will be 
ramping up our deliveries to meet 
the demand. We would definitely 
consider it a successful first 
week and we can’t wait to grow 
and carry out the lunch pop-ups 
and other events planned for the 
arcade.”
There 
are 
currently 
six 
members partnered with the 
collective, 
including 
Better 
Health of Novi, Fluffy Bottom 
Farms of Chelsea, and Harvest 
Kitchen, Juicy Kitchen, Salads 
UP and Tasty Kitchen, all of Ann 
Arbor. Butbul says the number of 
partners will continue to grow.
“We’re continuing to grow the 
roster, with special consideration 
to include companies and food 
items requested by customers,” 
Butbul said.

climate? Do you see the high 
amount of reported hate crimes 
as a success on the University’s 
part, or as a sign the University 
needs to work harder to prevent 
bias incidents? Why?

President Mark Schlissel: 
I think it’s very hard to know, 
but I share the frustration, and 
really the anger, that members 
of our community have to be 
subject to hate of any kind 
and particularly the hate of 
the type we’re talking about 
here — a hate crime based on 
identity. We are a very large, 
complicated organization with 
a lot of people coming and 
going, a lot of geography to 
cover, a lot of public buildings, 
and when hate is as simple 
as someone rolling down a 
car 
window 
and 
shouting 
something terrible at one of 
your fellow students or a faculty 
member, it’s a big challenge 
… I think we should continue 
to aggressively investigate all 
episodes that are brought to 
attention, 
recognizing 
that 
sometimes it’s very hard to 
track down a perpetrator given 
the scale and the openness of 
the campus … Probably some 
of it is a reporting incident, 
and remember, the number 
15 is a big number, but there’s 
45,000 students on campus, 
30,000 employees, so there 
shouldn’t be any episodes and 
15 should be 0 and we have 
to work in that direction. But 
I don’t want to dismiss it as 
enhanced reporting, but look 
at it for what it is and mitigate 
it. … One of the things I’d like 
to pay elevated attention to in 
the context of our DEI work 
is acts of religious bigotry and 
bias and some of that comes to 
the floor in discussions around 
Israel-Palestine politics, and 
I think we have to be wary of 
increases 
in 
anti-Semitism, 
increases 
in 
anti-Muslim 
bigotry and I think we are 
going to feature education and 
programs around that more 
prominently in the year ahead.

TMD: 
Along 
with 
information 
from 
the 
FBI 
report on hate crimes on 
university campuses, data from 
the Division of Public Safety 
and Security showed from 2015 
to 2017, the Black community 
reported the highest number 
of hate crimes followed by 
the 
Muslim, 
LGBTQ+ 
and 
Jewish 
communities. 
Given 
that 
different 
marginalized 
communities on campus may 
have varying comfort levels 
with reporting hate crimes, 
how do you plan to work with 
individual communities who 
are often targeted to prevent 
bias incidents?

MS: Me personally, but more 
importantly, Student Affairs, 
is 
continuously 
engaging 
with groups, and new groups 
come forward every day. I 
have every year, and we’ve 
already 
done 
several 
this 
academic year … meetings at 
my home over either breakfast 
or pizza for dinner to discuss 
these issues with leaders and 
members of all different kinds 
of groups, and various arms 
of student affairs have very 
regular 
interactions 
with 
student leaders representing 
each of the identity groups 
you mentioned. But those are 
just a handful and there are 
more. We’re all individuals 
that 
carry 
with 
us 
many 
identities and unfortunately 
at different moments we’re all 
subject to unfair or inequitable 
treatment and I think we have 
to prioritize eliminating this 
prejudicial treatment wherever 
we see it.

TMD: In a working paper 
published 
by 
the 
National 
Bureau of Economic Research 
in December 2018, researchers 
discussed the impact of the 
HAIL 
scholarship 
on 
the 
applications and attendance 
of students from low SES 
backgrounds. 
The 
study 
indicated 
personalized 
intervention, 
especially 
through 
attractive 
letter 
packaging and contact through 
HAIL, 
positively 
impacted 
students’ 
choice 
of 
more 
selective, elite schools. Given 
the study has only drawn 
conclusions from the first two 

years of the program, is it too 
soon to deem the scholarship 
a 
success 
in 
regards 
to 
substantially decreasing the 
income gap? Why?

MS: In the case of this 
HAIL 
Scholarship, 
which 
is a study led by Professor 
Dynarski 
from 
the 
school 
of Public Policy, the results 
were so incredibly striking 
that although the professor 
continues her study and this 
NBER publication was the 
first public report of the data, 
we’ve begun implementing it 
already … It’s such a major goal 
of our University, to make sure 
a Michigan education remains 
accessible and affordable, and 
we attract talented people 
from all different parts of the 
economy, and we’ve already 
implemented it and it’s already 
showing success … and one of 
the main take-homes from the 
HAIL Scholars program is in 
the setting of this high-touch 
interaction 
with 
potential 
students, instead of saying 
to them, if you say, ‘We give 
generous need-based financial 
aid and we’ll meet your full 
calculated need,’ if you say to 
them, ‘If you come from a family 
at or below a family income of 
65,000 dollars, you don’t pay 
any tuition — it’s free,’ it turns 
out that’s really powerful and 
the HAIL study, it increased 
the frequency of applicants 
two-and-a-half fold compared 
to a control group. … The HAIL 
Scholarship 
program 
really 
completely revolutionized the 
way we reach out to people in 
different parts of the Michigan 
economy. The early data — it’s 
only been one admissions cycle 
— but this year’s freshman class 
has increased its fraction of 
first-generation students, has 
increased its representation 
of students from the lower 
socioeconomic quadrants or 
quintiles of the economy, and 
it’s exceeded our expectations 
and we’re going to stick with 
it. And not only that, the study 
got national attention. So, it’s 
the buzz of the community 
of people around the country 
that are struggling with the 
problem of enticing talented 
kids from lower socioeconomic 
backgrounds 
to 
be 
brave 
enough 
to 
apply 
to 
great 
universities. So I’m really, I’m 
as proud of this as anything 
we’ve done.

TMD: Are there any plans to 
implement the paper’s findings 
about increased personalized, 
early intervention for all types 
of scholarships the University 
offers?

MS: We continuously learn 
what 
resonates 
as 
we 
do 
outreach around the state, so 
the goal is to have people from 
all around the state and all 
around the country think of us 
as an outstanding opportunity 
for their college education. 
And financial aid is part of it. 
We’ve tended to focus a lot of 
our resources on need-based 
aid … We try to use the lessons 
we 
learn 
from 
something 
like HAIL to improve the 
effectiveness of our outreach 
to students, and you know, it 
must be working. The number 
of applications we get is going 
up by leaps and bounds every 
year. This last year we got over 
65,000 applications, the year 
before we were in the high 50s. 
Two years earlier we were in 
the 40s … We’re quite good 
at attracting the attention of 
talented people to apply here.

TMD: At the final University 
of Michigan Senate Assembly 
of 2018, you discussed the 
University’s revisions to the 
policies 
regarding 
student 
sexual misconduct as well 
as a ban on faculty-student 
relationships. 
Some 
of 
the 
revisions involve establishing 
two different ways to settle 
cases 
— 
either 
through 
adaptable 
resolution 
or 
investigative resolution —the 
involvement of a case member 
from the Office of Student 
Conflict Resolution during each 
investigation, and the option 
for students to cross-question 
one another. What about the 
new policies will allow the 
University to deal with sexual 
misconduct more effectively?

T

he coming year stands 
to be a watershed for the 
raging debate over guns and 
gun violence in this country. Those 
who strongly oppose more stringent 
gun 
control 
measures 
remain 
shaken from a raft of prominent, 
though largely symbolic, policy 
changes enacted after last year’s 
mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman 
Douglas High School in Parkland, 
Fla., and seem especially vulnerable 
in light of Democrats’ recent takeover 
of the House of Representatives. 
Gun violence is one of the most 
intensely political issues in the U.S.. 
The extensive amount of media 
coverage (and conspiracy theories, 
for that matter) dedicated to the topic 
exemplify the polarized nature of 
the discussion. So, it’s prudent to ask: 
Why care about guns?
The emotional contours of the 
gun debate are a good place to start. 
Much like other forms of violence, 
mass shootings receive what many 
deem a disproportionate amount 
of media attention in the U.S. Even 
though 
this 
attention 
partially 
obscures the numerical primacy of 
bigger killers, such as heart disease 
and cancer, we should not chastise 
ourselves too much. Tragedy is found 
not only in absolute conceptions of 
death but also in relative ones. On 
average, as many Americans die 
every couple of days from heart 
disease as did Americans in all 
of the Sept. 11 attacks, but it is the 
latter that we memorialize because 
no one reasonably expected nearly 
3,000 healthy office workers and 
first responders to be murdered so 
gruesomely that day. So, beyond the 
unique grisliness that often define 
gun deaths, there is good reason to 
dedicate extra attention to cruel and 
often unpredictable incidences of 
gun violence.
Not only do we find gun violence 
intensely tragic compared to other, 
more natural causes of death, but 
also as Americans, we are forced to 
confront this tragedy much more 
often than our peers. Among the 
world’s free, wealthy and Western 
societies, the U.S. stands in a league 
of its own with regard to gun-related 
crime. Countries with similar overall 
rates of crime pale in comparison to 
the U.S. when one looks at per capita 
firearm homicides — sometimes, 
with specific regards to firearm 
homicides, by a factor as great as nine.
Yet writing off guns as just 
another weapon does not do proper 
justice to the unique power they 
possess. They are often used as tools 

of crime, yes, just like baseball bats, 
lead pipes and knives. But unlike any 
of these implements — none of which 
could be as feasibly regulated as a 
complexly machined firearm — guns 
make violent crimes much more 
lethal. Firearms’ impressive lethality, 
delivered in a package so concealable 
and accessible, is found in no other 
device. To sufficiently recognize the 
potential the gun possesses for both 
creating and preventing violence is 
to acknowledge this unique power, 
as anyone who has used one in self-
defense can attest to. 

It is also in this capacity of self-
defense that people often envision 
guns most romantically. While 
firearms and their unique power 
makes them ideal choices for 
individuals who wish to feel more 
secure, widespread gun use is weakly 
justified in light of the attendant 
dangers they pose to society as whole. 
This disconnect with reality reflects 
humans’ innate desire to care for 
our own security to preserve oneself 
even when the aggregate costs or 
the long-term risks of doing so prove 
to be countervailing. If we refuse 
to acknowledge these hardwired, 
albeit flawed, instincts that drive the 
popular desire to possess guns, we 
can scarcely begin to convince others 
that more guns may unwittingly 
make us less safe.
However, we as Americans 
should not approach guns only in 
terms of the distinctive dangers they 
pose, but also through a historical 
lens. From the minutemen who made 
possible the American Revolution 
to the frontiersmen who conquered 
Native American lands by force as 
they pushed to the Pacific, American 
history has been largely forged by 
the gun. The legacies of household 
militias and armed pioneers, and 
the way they have distinguished 
Americans from other Westerners to 
the present, are a force to be reckoned 
with in any effective approach to gun 
policy. Good and bad, guns are an 

indelible part of America’s past and 
present. Logistical and legal realities 
ensure they will be around for the 
future as well.
Moreover, the current moment 
demands 
levelheaded 
analysis 
of gun policy because prominent 
opinions often make the easy 
mistake of patently demonizing guns 
or wholeheartedly lionizing them. 
Gun control, while an important 
part of any comprehensive public 
health policy, should not hog the 
policy spotlight at the expense of 
other contributors to gun violence 
and crime more generally, such 
as inadequate public education, 
astronomical 
incarceration 
and 
recidivism rates and insufficient 
treatment of mental health. On the 
other hand, loudly decrying efforts 
to limit the Second Amendment 
without consistently and persuasively 
justifying a need for it inherently 
posits that the Constitution is entirely 
infallible (which the deeply flawed 
Electoral College proves otherwise) 
while overlooking our Constitutional 
right to legislatively revise outdated 
provisions. Addressing the gun-
related 
costs 
American 
society 
bears while maintaining the spirit 
of liberty set forth by the founding 
fathers requires that both of these 
considerations are paid due attention.
Gun violence in the U.S. is a 
national-level problem that demands 
national-level input. Taming this 
violence requires that we analyze 
gun policy with intense scrutiny, 
but vastly differing interpretations 
of gun rights in the U.S. reflect the 
significant 
political 
polarization 
that we must overcome to enact 
any meaningful change. 2019 may 
very well be the year that the pro-
gun lobby, after facing numerous 
setbacks, is forced to moderate some 
of its more apocalyptic doctrine. 
Alternatively, it could be the year 
that large-scale action on gun 
violence, despite recent legislative 
improvements, stalls in ordinary 
fashion. Regardless, solutions to 
gun violence will require thoughtful 
policies that acknowledge firearms’ 
incredible capacity to hurt, while 
respecting the rich history of 
firearms in America, not including 
the the impact on Native Americans, 
 
and the bearing this will have on 
gun control efforts down the road. 
There are plenty of reasons to care, 
and a lot of work to be done.

Why are we still talking about guns?

For tech newcomers, caution is required 
“ 
C

an’t 
you 

just write 

a program 

to do this?” is a half-

joking 
question 
I’m 

sure 
most 
of 
my 

computer science peers 

have received countless 

times. As computing 

permeates more and 

more of our world, we 

have less of a choice about 

how it affects us. In order 

to manage the increasing 

externalities, 
a 
culture 

shift is required. For too long, 

we have been operating under 

the presumption of “good” with 

regards to new technology. The 

magic touch of tech things has 

suddenly become just plain 

better. That’s how we get a 

fridge 
that 
can 
tweet. 
It’s 

obviously better than a fridge 

that can’t tweet!

Unfortunately, 
this 

phenomenon isn’t limited to 

misguided retailers. Software-

based elections are a perfect 

example of the potential for 

serious problems when this 

ideology is applied. Elections 

have been shifting away from 

paper 
ballots 
and 
towards 

electronic 
voting 
machines. 

This all changed with the 

“hanging 
chad” 
debacle 
of 

2000. 
The 
events 
of 
that 

election happened to coincide 

with the technology boom of 

the early 2000s and resulted 

in a rush to computer voting 

machines with the promise of 

increased clarity and efficiency. 

After all, it was the 21st century 

— why were we still relying on 

the cumbersome pen and paper 

to record our votes? For all the 

guarantees of computer voting 

machines, they’ve turned out 

to be quite the letdown. As 

Alex Halderman, a professor 

of 
Computer 
Science 
and 

Engineering at the University 

of 
Michigan, 
has 
shown 

repeatedly, they are vulnerable 

to a host of attacks and failure 

states that render them far 

inferior to paper-based voting 

systems.

We 
tend 
to 
think 
of 

technology only in its perfect 

state. 
When 
everything 
is 

running 
smoothly, 
computer 

voting systems sound like a 

more convenient and efficient 

way to do things. 

It is only when we 

consider the possible 

imperfections 
that 

we 
can 
obtain 
a 

truly 
informed 

assessment 
of 

the 
system. 
Alas, 

caution is woefully 

scarce 
in 
many 

discussions involving 

technology. 
Those 

who are employing 

the technology fear 

being 
seen 
as 
old-

fashioned, while those building 

the technology too often take a 

position similar to Facebook’s 

former 
motto, 
“Move 
fast 

and break things.” Risks and 

externalities are ignored for the 

creation of a shiny new system 

that demonstrates “progress.”

But if the product is faulty, 

won’t the market reflect that 

and correct itself? Won’t the 

company make a change lest 

the consumers turn to other 

options? Not necessarily, as 

technology failures tend to not 

make themselves obvious like 

a faulty air-bag. Your fridge 

could appear to be functioning 

perfectly, 
happily 
tweeting 

along, 
all 
the 
while 
being 

remotely accessed and enlisted 

in what is known as a botnet, 

which is a network of private 

computers 
infected 
with 

malicious software.

Furthermore, 
as 
more 

nontraditional 
technologoical 

entities 
utilize 
software 

systems, they are frequently 

dealing with small, external 

teams 
of 
developers 
that 

sometimes fail to follow best 

practices and often lack the 

resources 
of 
a 
large 
tech 

company to dedicate to issues 

of consumer protection such as 

security. Security threats tend 

to be like a game of whack-

a-mole — you patch one issue 

and two more pop up. Without 

a full-time staff of software 

professionals, 
these 
systems 

are bound to be one step behind.

Many of these problems 

stem 
from 
the 
idea 
that 

the spread of computing to 

anything 
and 
everything 

is 
just 
and 
inevitable. 
It 

is 
technology’s 
version 
of 

manifest destiny. I agree that 

the advent of computing has 

brought, 
and 
will 
continue 

to bring, countless powerful 

improvements to the world. 

That’s 
why 
I 
am 
studying 

computer science. However, we 

need to think carefully about 

where and how we use that 

technology, especially when it’s 

involved in economies of scale. 

One tweeting fridge is innocent, 

a conversation starter even. But 

one million tweeting fridges 

potentially becomes a massive 

botnet, enabling attackers to 

wreak havoc.

Entities 
considering 
the 

implementation of computing 

systems 
should 
consider 

worst-case societal outcomes 

and consult security experts 

when making their decision. 

In the world of government, 

this is a realistic goal and 

should be expected. In the 

retail 
world, 
this 
may 
be 

unrealistic. Ideally, we would 

trust these businesses to cast 

aside technology proposals that 

serve only as marketing ploys 

and offer no real consumer 

benefit. However, this seems to 

be a classic prisoner’s dilemma 

for which regulation may be 

needed to induce cooperation. 

Requiring 
a 
product 
with 

computing 
capabilities 
and 

large sales to have full-time 

software staff dedicated to its 

maintenance is one possibility.

E

very New Year’s Day, 
my timeline is filled 
with 
New 
Year’s 
resolutions and claims that 
the next year will be “the 
very best one yet.” My peers 
are going to get in shape, eat 
healthier and study harder. 
They 
also, 
often 
times, 
reflect on the geopolitical 
landscape of the previous 
year. 
They 
are 
always 
hoping the next year brings 
less war and more peace, 
less corruption and more 
transparency, and there is 
an overall sentiment of hope 
that the world will hang on 
by a thread for one more 
year. As the days pass on, 
people may hit the gym and 
put blood, sweat and tears 
into keto diets. However, 
when it comes to the state of 
the world, it seems most of 
us do little more than keep 
our fingers crossed.
It has been overstated, 
etched on decorative pillows, 
and clichéd to an almost 
unbearable degree that one 
must “be the change you 
want to see in the world.” Yet 
few New Year’s resolutions 
that 
have 
hit 
my 
social 
media timelines in the past 
few days have included any 
community 
service 
plans. 
We as a society are obsessed 
with personal improvement 
kicks, but hardly ever do 
these trendy diets or yoga 
plans 
include 
community 
improvement 
initiative. 
What if this New Year’s, 
alongside 
our 
book 
lists 
and 
workout 
plans, 
we 
made plans to volunteer in 
our communities one day a 
week or even just one day a 
month?
We 
sit 
behind 
our 
computer screens discussing 
the 
latest 
National 

Geographic 
article 
about 
the abuse of plastics, yet 
how 
many 
of 
our 
New 
Year’s resolutions involve 
volunteering to clean up 
roadways and parks? We 
live in one of the coldest 
states in the continental 
United States, and yet how 
many of us will donate old 
blankets or boots to the local 
homeless 
shelters? 
Many 
of us will save up money 
for new phones, watches or 
Lululemon leggings, but how 
many of us will donate to 
relief efforts to help rebuild 
smoldering 
communities 
in 
California? 
We 
have 
arguably the best children’s 
hospital in the state in our 
backyard, but how many of 
us will volunteer there this 

year?
On this subject, I admit 
that 
I 
am 
a 
hypocrite. 
As I sat in my home this 
New 
Year’s 
Eve, 
trying 
desperately to stay awake 
long enough to see the ball in 
Times Square drop, I thought 
about how little I had done 
for others in the past year. 
I hardly volunteered in my 
community at all. I didn’t 
donate my time or resources 
to 
any 
local 
charities. 
Overall, I was not a citizen 
with a true commitment to 
bettering the world around 

me. For a moment, I made 
excuses for myself, such as: 
trying to boost my GPA, I was 
sick quite a few times or I 
had a hard summer. Yet, none 
of these excuses made up 
for all the hours of Twitter 
scrolling 
and 
Domino’s 
eating that had sucked up so 
much of my time and money 
into wholly self-gratifying 
efforts.
The truth is that we are 
all busy. We all have things 
in our personal lives we 
want to improve. Sometimes 
we do need to focus on 
ourselves 
by 
ordering 
a 
pizza and binging Pirates 
of the Caribbean, but what 
if this year we made some 
time in our calendars for 
helping our communities 
as well? Imagine all that 
we could change if every 
student at the University 
of Michigan donated just 
a little bit of their time 
to 
volunteering 
in 
Ann 
Arbor and the surrounding 
areas. We live in a bubble 
as highly privileged college 
students attending one of the 
most prestigious universities 
in the nation, yet every time 
we look at our phones or 
turn on the news, we see 
how small that bubble truly 
is. The world around us can 
most definitely be better 
in 2019 than it was in years 
past, but maybe this year, 
instead of merely crossing 
our fingers while we run 
on t he t readmill, we ca n 
ma ke resolutions to be a 
pa r t of t he solution.

Although Sarah Hayes and 
Peter Brewis do not exist in 
the space of musical theater, 
their debut self-titled album, 
You Tell Me, could certainly 
pass as an attempt at Broadway. 
The album’s theatrical effect 
brews from not only mawkish 
sentimentality, but also from a 
blatant attempt at a fresh blend of 
Hayes’s indie-folk and Brewis’s 
rock-pop, which unfortunately 
creates a trite sound.
One half of the You Tell 
Me duo is composed of Sarah 
Hayes, a Scottish flautist, 
keyboard player and singer. 
Hayes serves as one-fifth 
of the wholesome folk band 
Admiral Fallow in addition 
to having released her own 
debut album titled Woven, 
which establishes her skillful 
aptitude for flute and keyboard. 
Peter Brewis, the other half of 
You Tell Me, has seen success 
in his British rock band Field 
Music, while also using his 
strong 
compositional 
talent 
in the industry for more than 
fifteen years, particularly when 
it comes to electro-pop. Hayes 
sought Brewis out at a concert, 
and the You Tell Me pair was 
born.
You Tell Me attempts to blend 
the duo’s talents — Hayes’s 
ballad-like 
folk 
voice 
and 
Brewis’s hints of pop; however, 

the effect is more suited for a 
musical, as listeners can feel the 
gears of the duo glaringly turning 
to create an awe-inspired effect. 
Over-sentimentality is created 
not only with Hayes’s long-held 
notes, but also with the blatant 
corniness of the lyrics, which is 
most notably seen in “Invisible 
Ink”: “Held in a lie just so secrets 
are shown / They inspect, you 
oblige, every silence feeds the 
lie.” The melodrama continues 
in “Get Out of The Room”: 
“You’re 
scared 
of 
settling 
down / You already said you 

were moving away from me, 
now you’re asking if you can 
stay.” The emotions are there, 
unfortunately, they come across 
as plain-spoken.
More important than the 
overtly corny lyrics, the main 
contributor 
to 
the 
musical 
theater vibe is the album’s 
tendency to catch the listener 
with one sound, only to abruptly 
showcase a different noise. The 
best example of a track breaking 
back on itself in this way is the 
outro “Kabuki,” which begins 
with electronic pop, only to dip 

out of synths halfway through 
and completely burrow into 
theatrical strings. The blend 
trend in the music industry 
holds infinite rewards – the mix 
of varying talents oftens leading 
to a fresh, original sound. 
However, it feels as if You Tell 
Me serves as an exposition for 
each artist’s individual talents. 
Simply put, the album exists as 
a mix of oil and water, instead 
of inhabiting the space between 
Hayes and Brewis. Melodies 
break 
quickly, 
leaving 
the 
listener struggling to ground 
themselves, floating around 
between the two musicians’ 
styles.
Although 
the 
album 
cripples 
itself 
with 
an 
intense emphasis on the 
duo blending their sounds, 
their use of instruments 
clearly exhibits experience 
in the music industry. Catchy 
keyboard rhythms push the 
listener through each song, 
and strings delicately warrant 
attention. Most notably, You Tell 
Me holds moments of soothing 
complement — “Get Out Of The 
Room” features an even use of 
voice from Brewis and Hayes, 
and they capture a brief moment 
of rich sound. Unfortunately, as 
seen by a multitude of artists, 
(more than just You Tell Me), 
the space between contrasting 
entities 
proves 
quite 
hard 
to grasp, with high risk and 
powerful rewards. 

‘You Tell Me’ attempts 
synthesis, fails overall

MUSIC REVIEW

When I was a little girl, I ran 
into my mother’s room crying 
because I had a nightmare where 
she was eaten by a goblin. I 
jumped into her arms and asked 
her to never leave me. She told 
me that one day, hopefully a day 
far away from then, she would 
have to leave this earth, but she 
would never leave me. She said 
that we always carry the people 
we love within us, wherever we 
go. Moving away to college, 
I found that sentiment to be 
more true than ever before. 
If I think hard enough, I can 
distinctly smell the rosy scent 
of my mother’s perfume. If I 
close my eyes for long enough, 
I can hear the laughter my 
brother and I shared over an 
episode of Spongebob. We carry 
the experiences we have with 
our loved ones for our entire 
lives. I have always believed 

this is true for everyone. One 
chilly winter’s evening, as the 
long awaited snow of January 
was falling softly outside the 
window of Literati Bookstore, 
this belief was further solidified 
in my mind.
Sid 
Smith, 
a 
professor 
of Women’s Studies at the 
University, received devastating 
news a few years ago: Her 
husband was diagnosed with 
dementia. A lot changed after 
this diagnosis, specifically his 
ability to tell stories like he 
used to, which is why Smith 
conducted 
the 
reading 
of 
her husband’s book “Canio’s 
Secret,” a book laced with 
memories Greg was no longer 
able to recall. Currently, Greg’s 
dimentia prevents him from 
reading his story himself. 
Walking into Literati, I was a 
bit skeptical. I didn’t know much 
about this book besides the brief 
description I had read online. I 
knew it was set in Chicago in the 

’50s and that it was a “coming-
of-age 
story 
chronicling 
a 
boy’s poignant struggle to find 
consolation in his mother’s 
Catholicism 
and to break 
free of his 
father’s 
anger.” 
I 
was curious 
as to why 
the wife of 
the author 
was reading 
his novel, as 
opposed to 
the author 
himself. 
But 
then 
Sid 
Smith 
began 
to 
speak of her 
husband 
and 
his 
battle 
with 
dementia, 
my 
questions were answered.
“The 
memories 
in 
this 
book 
have 
evaporated 
like 

snowflakes in his mind,” Smith 
wrote in her editor’s note. She 
went on to add, “I don’t have 
the theatrical background that 
Greg had, so I probably 
won’t be able to do his 
story as much justice 
as he could in reading 
it.” Smith spoke of the 
love she had for her 
husband, holding back 
tears as she read the 
note. Her delicate and 
thoughtful 
reading 
of 
his 
writing 
was 
moving.
As 
a 
listener, 
I 
could almost hear her 
husband speaking the 
words he wrote. “It’s 
hard for me to read 
it, in a way, because 
I can hear his voice 
saying it,” Smith said. 
Although I hadn’t met her 
husband before, I felt as though 
I could hear his voice saying it, 
too. Her deep understanding 

and love for her husband made 
it easy for listeners to envision 
him reading his words right 
alongside her.
The 
story 
itself 
was 
intriguing. 
There 
were 
numerous themes at play: Greg’s 
relationship with catholicism, 
his familial conflicts and a 
young boy finding his way in 
’50s Chicago. The sections of 
the book Smith had selected for 
the reading allowed listeners to 
gage a full scope of the content 
of the book without giving away 
too much. The passages she 
read were detailed and left me 
wanting to read more.
I wish the crowd size of the 
event was larger and that there 
were more youth and students 
in the audience. Me and my 
three friends seemed to be the 
youngest in the audience of 20 
people by about 15 years. The 
event as a whole was very well 
put together, but I wish more 
people had experienced the rich 

words of Greg’s novel.
Smith’s love for her husband 
radiated to the entire room. 
Her 
husband, 
pre-dementia, 
was still living and breathing 
inside 
of 
her. 
He 
seemed 
to be joining the guests at 
Literati in an evening out as 
well. During the question and 
answer portion of the event, 
Smith read an anecdote about 
how her husband was a real 
charmer. How he could talk up 
anyone in any room because he 
was truly interested in people. 
During this reading, it felt as 
if Greg was waltzing around 
the bookstore, charming us all 
by telling the intriguing story 
of his life. It’s quite beautiful 
how love has the power to 
create entire beings. It’s quite 
beautiful how Smith had the 
strength and perseverance to 
share both her husband and her 
love for him with all of us for a 
few hours on a snowy January 
evening. What a gift it was.

“It’s hard for 
me to read it, in 
a way, because 
I can hear his 
voice saying it,” 
Smith said.

Stephen 
Falk’s 
criminally 
underrated “You’re the Worst” 
enters its final season promising 
a happy ending to the story 
of its two narcissistic, vulgar, 
blowhard protagonists. However, 
anyone who has been following 
the 
show 
since 
its inception will 
be holding their 
breath. After all, if 
there is anything 
we 
know 
about 
these 
characters 
at all at this point, 
it is that they are 
prepared to eject 
at any moment.
The 
season 
premiere does not 
assuage nor deepen 
these 
concerns 
but 
rather 
creatively 
sums 
up 
everything 
about 
the 
show 
to this point. We 
flash back to the 
’90s, 
where 
a 
video store owner 
and 
amateur 
filmmaker 
Jake 
(Morgan 
Krantz, 
“Neurotica”) 
meets 
fellow 
cinephile, Gemma 
(Caitlin 
McGee, 
“I’m 
Dying 
Up 
Here”), 
browsing 
the “Staff Picks” 
section 
of 
his 
store. 
They 
immediately 
hit 
it off, exchanging 
snappy 
banter 
and 
revealing 
a 
shared desire to 
see an extremely 
rare 
French 
film called “The 
Intransigence 
of 
Love.”
Roughly ten minutes into this 
picturesque meet-cute, it turns 
out this budding love story is 
an entirely fabricated one, with 
our protagonists Jimmy (Chris 
Geere, 
“Ill 
Behaviour”) 
and 
Gretchen (Aya Cash, “Fosse/

Verdon”) attempting to create 
a compelling fiction about how 
they actually met while guzzling 
down 
the 
complimentary 
alcohol. Falk’s writing lovingly 
skewers ’90s movies, as well as 
general romcom tropes, but it 
also seems to admire them. He 
understands the universal desire 
to continue making these types 
of 
films 
and 
to 
articulate 
the 
intense 
emotions 
stemming 
from a special 
romance, but as 
he has always 
shown, 
he 
believes 
that 
such romances 
are much more 
multifaceted 
than 
they 
are 
usually 
portrayed 
and 
also 
deserving 
of 
a 
more 
true-to-life 
treatment.
Although 
the 
couple 
themselves 
would 
surely 
despise 
anything 
remotely 
resembling 
the 
tropes 
of 
the 
rom-com 
genre, 
their 
real moments of 
sheer sweetness 
(e.g. 
Jimmy’s 
support during 
the worst spell 
of 
Gretchen’s 
depression) 
that have led 
them up to this 
point in their 
relationship 
are 
just 
as 
important. 
Sure, Gretchen 
and Jimmy are terrible people; 
they both have run out on each 
other and have broken each 
other’s hearts in cynical fashion. 
Perhaps more so than any show 
on TV, the show never backs down 
from showing the ugly, messy 

side of modern relationships. 
However, Gretchen and Jimmy 

have also made real sacrifices 
for and have come to understand 
each other more than anyone in 
their lives. 
The second half of the season 
opener returns viewers to the 
rose-tinted 
flashback 
world 
of “Jake” and “Gemma,” with 
Jimmy and Gretchen actually 
playing their invented personas. 
After a brief reunion at a New 
Year’s Party, Jake and Gemma 
are separated for a while before 
a dramatic scene at the “Le 
France” film festival, in which 
Gemma, 
now 
an 
acclaimed 
director, is winning an award. 
Out of nowhere, Jake arrives 
at her press conference to ask 
a question about where she got 
her first film camera, and before 
long, the two fall in love all over 
again. Enter a brief interlude 
including a confrontation with 
a portly French film professor, 
which yanks viewers out of the 
reverie, back to the real world. 
The story gets hastily wrapped 
up as Jimmy and Gretchen decide 
to barge out of their meeting.
Their 
final 
conversation 
reveals the crux of the episode. 
While 
they 
have 
been 
too 
embarrassed by their actual love 
story to ever tell it to any of their 
current companions, it is the 
only one that actually feels real. 
“You’re the Worst” has always 
celebrated the gloriously ugly 
journey the couple has taken, 
and in this final season, it will be 
exciting to see whether they can 
finally commit to it.

However, anyone

inception will

If Wilma’s Ann Arbor were a 
person, she’d be a trendy, crunchy 
redhead who owns cats and 
succulents and has a spice garden 
in her backyard. She’d be the type 
of woman who could look cute 
matching 
completely 
different 
patterns, casually pull off clogs 
and she’d always use reusable 
grocery bags at the farmer’s 
market. She’d be the girl at hot 
yoga who isn’t trying to show off 
but is just naturally incredibly 
flexible and somehow looks good 
after sweating for an hour-long 
class. She’d play the guitar and 
enjoy hiking, make her own oat 
milk and have her own book 
club. She’d also be an Instagram 
influencer from L.A. 
Wilma’s 
(formerly 
known 
as Fred’s) has been a staple in 
the 
Ann 
Arbor 
community 
since it first opened its doors 
on 
South 
University 
Avenue 
three years ago. The trendy, 
health-foodie cafe and coffee bar 
“Fred’s” moved to its spot on E. 
Washington Street and grew into 
its quirky name with a similarly 
idiosyncratic personality. After 
facing licensing issues with the 
name, the original Fred’s had to 
rebrand and create a new title for 
the well-known restaurant. Being 
such a pertinent part of student 
life at the University of Michigan, 
owners Fred Lelcaj and Nathan 
D’Andrea left the choice in the 
hands of the customers, running 
a name-change campaign for 
several months in which they 
received thousands of ideas. 
“The goal,” D’Andrea said in an 
interview with The Daily, “was for 
our customers to give us a name 
that makes the feel at home —
there’s a certain feeling people get 
when they come in here and we 
wanted the name to reflect those 
sentiments.” 
When selecting the perfect 
name for their spot, they knew 
they wanted to go with a female 
name and something that had the 
same personal feel that Fred’s did. 
They assume that multiple people 
suggested Wilma’s because of the 
Flintstones reference — Wilma 
being Fred Flintstone’s wife — 
but the team behind Wilma’s 
selected the name because they 
associated it with a homey and 
happy feel. They felt as though the 
name “Wilma” felt like an older 
generational name and liked the 
way the ‘w’ looked in cursive on 
their fresh new logo as well. 
“Wilma’s reminds a lot of us of 
a mother or grandmother’s name,” 
D’Andrea said. “And a lot of 
people associated Fred’s, and now 
Wilma’s, with a feeling of home.” 
Something about the interior 
of the restaurant really brings 
on that comfortable, cozy feel 
whenever you walk into the door 
for brunch, lunch, dinner or a 
smoothie. The white-tiled floors 
are complemented by bright, 
natural light spilling in from the 
floor-to-ceiling 
windows, 
and 
lush, green, overgrown plants 
adorn all of the empty spaces. A 
bohemian style hanging swing, 
comfortable low couches and a 
simple earth tone rug decorate the 
living-room-esque seating area 
before the counter. The intention 
here is to fill some of the empty 
space in the restaurant with 
purposeful furniture, instead of 
misusing or not using the space at 
all. The living room area is often 
utilized as a study spot, a reading 
nook or a solo dining area when 
someone stops in for a lunch break 
or a latte. To the left of the counter, 
the main seating section is mostly 
white and simple, complemented 
by simple, green toned accessories 
and of course, on the tables, the 
beautifully crafted açai bowls and 
heavily topped avocado toasts. 
The interior of Wilma’s really 
fits her unique personality, the 
culinary experience and overall 
chic ambiance. The idea for Ann 
Arbor’s premiere health food 
oasis was born out of a vision to 
bring a clean, creative culinary 
experience to Ann Arbor — one 
that mimics health food trends 
on the East and West Coasts that 
we as diners don’t often have the 
privilege of encountering in the 
Midwest. 
“You know food trends sort 
of start in Australia, and then 

they go to California, and then 
they skip over the entire country 
and go to the East Coast,” said 
D’Andrea when asked about the 
original intention and idea behind 
Wilma’s. “We wanted to create 
an East Coast-West Coast vibe, 
serving everything from light 
snacks to meals. We wanted to 
stay ahead of the trends so that we 
can be the start of the trends for 
other places here in Ann Arbor. 
Being a city that has a surplus of 
folks from other coastal cities, the 
idea works really well.”
In terms of foodie trends, 
from açaí bowls to avocado toast 
to poke to turmeric to stuffed 
avocados to blue majik lattes, 
Wilma’s did it before anywhere 
else in Ann Arbor, and, because 
they go the extra mile to ensure 
everything is authentic, delicious 
and beautiful, they do it better. 
The menu has not changed much 
with the rebranding and the same 
clean, unique and healthy dishes 
are still available, from snacks 
and small plates to full meals. 
The top seller, no surprise, is the 
avocado toast, which is made on 
a thick slice of fresh Zingerman’s 
bread and topped with perfectly 
symmetrical slices of avocado, 
bright pink pickled onion and a 
dusting of chili flakes. A welcome 
addition is a perfectly cooked 
egg, and the runny, bright yellow 
yolk pools into the soft bread and 
makes the most mouthwatering 
dish. Coming in as the second-
best seller is the acai bowl, which 
is topped with thinly sliced red 
apple, coconut flakes, crunchy 
pumpkin seeds, to-die-for gluten 
free granola and a lacy drizzle of 
honey. Other best sellers include 
the salmon bowl, which is paired 
with a unique starchy cauliflower 
fried rice, avocado and kimchi and 
the tuna poke, which is served 
with a sweet mango salad and 
toasted sesame. This wide array 
of favorites by customers is a 
testament to the fact that Wilma’s 
takes on a diverse variety of flavors, 
cultures and trends in their menu 
and manages to succeed with all 
of them. Sometimes a major risk 
is not honing in on one particular 
cuisine and attempting to be 
masters at too many flavors — but 
the restaurant manages to take on 
this risk, and succeeds effortlessly. 
“With the food, what we care 
the most about is putting thought 
into it and creating each menu item 
thoroughly. Anything here can be 
made gluten free and or vegan,” 
D’Andrea said when asked about 
how they create the menu. When 
asked about his favorite dishes 
he remarked, “I can’t really pick 
a favorite. Every time someone 
asks me what the best thing on the 
menu is, I tell them they should 
try something they haven’t before, 
or try something new. I firmly 
believe that everything we make 
here is that good.” 
In addition to the full menu 
donned with smoothies, toasts 
and salads, Wilma’s also has a 
rotating selection of homemade 
gluten free and vegan pastries 
on display, including thick and 
creamy chocolate cupcakes, crispy 
yet soft ginger molasses cookies 
and colorful funfetti cupcakes. If 
you’re looking for both a healthy 
and 
simple 
option 
that 
has 
something that everyone in your 
party will like, you can’t go wrong 
with Wilma’s. When I was there, 
I had the “nice cream,” a healthy 
take on ice cream made with 
banana, avocado, vegan protein 
and cold brew topped with a layer 
of creamy almond butter, crunchy 
clusters of spiced granola, banana 
and hemp hearts. I couldn’t pass 
up the gluten free avocado toast 
with a fried egg as well, which was 
the perfect balanced breakfast 
choice. To wash it all down, I 
opted for an almond milk matcha 
latte, which I had unsweetened; 
however, it still had a perfectly 
subtle sweet taste. 
“We like to explore and take 
risks, find out what the benefits 
are of certain health foods, and 
not pigeonhole ourselves to being 
one cuisine or one “thing.” We 
want to be able to push ourselves 
to discover new things everyday. 
People are heading toward being 
more health conscious — for the 
mind, body and soul,” D’Andrea 
said 
when 
asked 
about 
the 
wonderfully diverse and unique 
menu. 

At Wilma’s much of the choices 
on the menu remind me of 
restaurants from where I grew up, 
about 1,000 miles away from here 
on the East Coast where many 
people are hooked on health-
foodie trends and Instagrammable 
dining experiences. There aren’t 
many spots in town where I can 
feel like I’m in any of the cafes of 
my hometown, or having brunch 
with my family on a Saturday 
afternoon, but Wilma’s really 
replicates a strong feeling of the 
East Coast, of home, that I’ve yet 
to find elsewhere. 
“For 
the 
out-of-state 
kids 
from the West and East Coasts, 
we are sort of like a home away 
from home,” D’Andrea said when 
asked about the demographic 
of customers. The majority of 
their customers comes from the 
undergraduate community, and 
the owners have worked hard to 
foster a semblance of home for 
students who come to the Midwest 
for college from some place far 
away. “It’s like a different state in 
here, and we often have students 
telling us how much they feel 
that Wilma’s personality reminds 
them of their homes in California, 
New York, New Jersey.” 
In narrowing their identity 
a bit with the rebranding, the 
team behind Wilma’s wanted to 
make the entire restaurant have a 
throughline in its vibe, as opposed 
to having contrasting feelings 
in the different corners of the 
restaurant. They made the fix by 
decluttering some of their spaces, 
making sure all of the surfaces are 
clean and match the simplicity of 
the food and moving the plants 
higher up instead of at eye level. In 
matching their interior with the 
food they made sure the look of the 
place followed a similar trendy, 
boho feeling and everything else 
fell in line with the same theme. 
The dress code for employees, 
music choices, cutlery, cushions 
and decorations all fall into the 
same trend-setter, coastal, simple 
motif. The restaurant is a full 
package in terms of the dining 
experience, and the commitment 
to all the details contributes to its 
allure. 
The restaurant is well-known 
for its Instagrammable qualities: 
The ways in which everything 
from the intimate interior to 
the picture perfect dishes are 
incredibly photogenic. 
“We’re always looking for 
ways to include opportunities for 
people to want the world to know 
they were here. We’re putting 
a trendy mirror about halfway 
through the line so when people 
are waiting on a long line with 
friends, they can snap a selfie. 
But the Instagrammable aspect 
is just one piece of the puzzle, it’s 
about so much more,” D’Andrea 
said 
when 
asked 
about 
the 
social media behind Wilma’s (@
wilmasannarbor). 
The team at Wilma’s values 
human interactions, even if it’s 
just in the simple exchange of a 
few dollars for a cup of tea to go. 
They focus on the touch points 
and small details, which starts 
with making the customers feel 
welcome for however short or 
long their visit to the quaint, green 
oasis is. Because there are more 
restaurants per capita in Ann 
Arbor than in New York City, the 
competition is steep, and going 
the extra mile goes a long way in 
curating a popular spot in a city 
so crowded with restaurants. 
Thinking of unique ideas, working 
hard to stay on top of trends, taking 
risks and providing a familiar feel 
are all important pieces to Wilma’s 
puzzle. These are the things 
that attract students, Ann Arbor 
residents and businessmen and 
women to Wilma’s for a beetroot 
and quinoa burger — choices both 
loaded with nutrients and tasty.
“Healthy is what people want 
these days. The trend of health 
food is taking off all over and we 
want to set the precedent for what 
that looks like in Ann Arbor while 
also providing an individual, 
extraordinary 
experience 
that 
evokes feelings of home for the 
customer,” 
D’Andrea 
said 
in 
regards to the restaurant officially 
rebranding as Wilma’s. 

Goodbye Fred’s, it’s time 
to welcome Wilma’s

“A Dog’s Way 
Home”

Sony Pictures 
Releasing 

Ann Arbor 20+ 
IMAX, Goodrich 
Quality 16

“A Dog’s Way Home” plays less 
like a movie than it does a series of 
stitched together YouTube videos, 
as if an aspiring editor with a lot 
of time on their hands took to the 
internet, cut together the most 
endearing stock footage of dogs 
they could find, and somehow 
convinced Bryce Dallas Howard 
(“Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom”) 
to do a voiceover. In that light, it 
sounds almost pleasant, right? The 
problem, 
of 
course, is that 
“A Dog’s Way 
Home” 
isn’t 
a 
YouTube 
video. 
It’s 
a 
movie, 
which comes 
with 
certain 
expectations. 
Frankly, 
man’s 
best 
friend 
deserves 
better 
than 
a 
YouTube 
video 
with 
high 
production 
values.
The quasi-
spinoff 
of 
2017’s 
“A 
Dog’s Purpose” – the two films are 
both based on novels by W. Bruce 

Cameron, and “A Dog’s Way Home” 
certainly didn’t take any measures 
to distance itself from the earlier 
movie despite having no connection 
to it – “A Dog’s Way Home” follows 
a pit bull mix named 
Bella who finds herself 
separated 
from 
her 
owner and sets off 
on a 400-mile trek to 
reunite with him. On 
her journey, she runs 
across 
all 
manner 
of 
CGI 
creatures, 
including 
a 
cougar 
kitten 
that 
she 
raises as 
her own and a pack 
of wolves that are 
eventually dispatched 
in a fight scene that, 
strangely 
enough, 
recalls 
“Kingsman: 
The Golden Circle” 
with its impenetrable 
zooms and pans.
In 
the 
best 
moments of the movie, 
“A Dog’s Way Home” 
deals 
with 
Bella 
acting as a therapy 
animal in a way that 
could have made for 
an entertaining short 
film. Based on how 
often that motif recurs, 
it’s likely supposed to 
form some sort of backbone for the 
movie, but neither Bella nor the 

humans she interacts with and helps 
are developed enough for any of it 
to make sense and say something 
beyond, 
“Dogs 
are 
awesome.” 
I know dogs are awesome. You 
know dogs are 
awesome. 
We 
don’t 
need 
a 
102-minute movie 
to tell us so.
Much 
more 
memorable, 
unfortunately, are 
where “A Dog’s 
Way 
Home” 
descends 
into 
wanton 
misery. 
In what may end 
up the most nihilistic scene of any 
movie this year, Bella finds herself 
chained to the corpse of a PTSD-
stricken homeless veteran for days 
with a river mere inches out of 
reach, a vision of Hell so appallingly 
dark that even Dante may have 
passed on it in favor of something 
a little more lighthearted. I’m all 
for movies speaking to kids on 
their level and not condescending 
to them, but there’s a difference 
between 
treating 
your 
young 
audience with a modicum of respect 
and beating them over the head with 
hopelessness and despondency in a 
movie about a talking dog.
More entertaining still were the 
reactions of the people around me. 
The young boy in front of me grew 
so bored that, as the interminable 
second act wore on, he got up and 
started introducing 
himself to other 
people 
in 
the 
theater. His name 
was Murphy, and 
he 
showed 
me 
his new light-up 
sneakers. 
They 
were 
very 
cool. 
The 
woman 
I 
shared an armrest 
with, on the other 
hand, seemed to be 
having a religious 
experience, 
complete 
with 
convulsions 
and speaking in 
tongues 
at 
the 
screen as if the 
characters 
could 
actually hear her.
Together, 
Murphy and this 
woman 
had 
all 
the personality “A 
Dog’s Way Home” 
was lacking. It’s not 
terrible – though 
Howard’s 
stilted 
voice 
over 
does 
nothing to help – 
it’s just the most 
generic 
possible 
dog movie. Instead 
of making your way 
to the theater and 
dropping 
dollars 
on this, might I 
recommend 
last 
year’s 
beautiful 
prehistoric 
“boy 
and his dog” story, 
“Alpha” 
instead? 
Or 
how 
about 
ABC’s short-lived 
but 
excellent 
talking dog series, 
“Downward Dog”? 
Or hell, how about 
staying home and 
watching cute or 
inspiring videos of 
dogs on YouTube. 
You’ll certainly get 
nothing more out 
of “A Dog’s Way 
Home.”

‘A Dog’s Way Home’ does 
little for all canine kind

Wolverines track and field breaks 
multiple records in season opener

As the gun went off on 
Saturday for the first race of 
the Wolverine Invitational, the 
University of Michigan Indoor 
Track and Field Arena was 
already buzzing with activity. 
Athletes were moving on all 
sections of the floor as the high 
jump, shot put, long jump, pole 
vault and hurdling events all 
began. 
The Wolverines broke many 
records over the next four hours, 
including back-to-back throws 
in the women’s weight throw 
event. Senior Bailey Baker broke 
the school record with a throw 
of 19.28 meters, which was 
upped by .25 on the next throw 
by senior Kayla Deering. Junior 
Andrew Liskowitz also broke 
the school record for men’s shot 
put. Other personal records 
were broken in the men’s weight 
throw, both the women’s and 
the men’s 60-meter hurdles, 
and the women’s 3000-meter 
events. This performance even 
surpassed 
Michigan 
coach 
James Henry’s expectations.
“I 
was 
expecting 
some 
broken performances in the 
essence of sometimes the kids 
get nervous on their first time 

out, but to get those kinds of 
performances makes me more 
optimistic,” Henry said. “Even 
though the first step is the most 
important, we’ve got a lot more 
steps to go.”
Out of seven teams and 35 
events, Michigan ended up with 
21 athletes finishing in the top 
three, six of whom won their 
event.
The Wolverines had a strong 
start in both the men’s and 
women’s 
60-meter 
hurdles. 
After taking four of the top five 
times in the heats, junior Roland 
Amarteifio crossed the finish 
line first with sophomore Sierra 
Hendrix-Williams coming in 
third. On the women’s side, only 
freshman Michaiah Thomas 
qualified for the final, finishing 
sixth. 
The Michigan men continued 
to succeed in the following 
track 
events, 
particularly 
dominating the mile event in 
which the Wolverines had the 
six fastest times, including 
first and second-place finishes 
by freshmen Gabe Mudel and 
Dominic Dimambro. While the 
women could not crack the top 
five in the mile, they succeeded 
more in the short distances with 
junior Jade Harrison coming in 
first in the 200-meter dash. 

Possibly the most exciting 
moment of the meet came in 
the penultimate event, the 
women’s 4x400 meter relay. 
With roughly 500 meters left, 
junior Julia Hall moved into 
second place, which had been 
occupied by Michigan State 
in the earlier part of the race. 
Michigan surprised the crowd 
again in the last 200 meters 
when freshman Aurora Rynda 
overtook 
Eastern 
Michigan 
for first place, quickly putting 
distance between herself and 
the rest of the pack. 
Henry attributed Michigan’s 
overall 
strong 
results 
and 
the new team records to the 
strategic training. 
“We prepped ourselves quite 
well,” Henry said. “We do an 
excellent job prepping ourselves 
for our program. We’ve been 
prepping since September, so 
this is a chance to do our first 
competition and I would call it 
a dress rehearsal. It was a good 
dress rehearsal.
“There’s so many steps to the 
Big Ten, so we’ve got a 10-step 
process and this is just step one. 
Some of the kids stumbled on 
their first step and some of the 
kids did well on their first step. 
We’ve just got to evaluate and 
take it one step at a time.”

LANE KIZZIAH
For the Daily

The life of 
a collegiate 
athletic 
program 
is 
one 
of 
continuous 
overhaul. 
At the end 
of 
every 
season, 
coaches 
move 
on, 
seniors 
graduate and a fresh flock of 
wide-eyed freshmen join the 
team.
Naturally, 
new 
seasons 
always bring about change 
and 
unknowns. 
Coming 
into the 2018-19 women’s 
basketball season, programs 
in the Big Ten Conference had 
seemingly experienced more 
change and featured more 
unknowns than most other 
leagues around the country. 
Five of the Big Ten’s top seven 
leading 
scorers 
from 
last 
season departed — Michigan 
point guard Katelynn Flaherty 
being third on that list. To put 
it simply, the conference was 
ripe for the taking.
Despite 
losing 
Flaherty 
and senior Jillian Dunston, 
it was not a far-fetched 
notion that the Wolverines 
— who finished sixth in the 
conference and made it to the 
second round of the NCAA 
Tournament — could ascend 
to bigger and better things 
this season.
Seniors Hallie Thome and 
Nicole Munger were set to 
take over the leadership roles 
of Flaherty and Dunston, both 

on and off the court. A stellar 
recruiting class featuring the 
likes of point guard Amy Dilk 
and forward Naz Hillmon 
supplemented a young but 
talented roster. This was a 
reload, the theory went, not a 
rebuild.
Through 17 games, only a 
few of those premises have 
come to fruition.
Teams in the Big Ten clearly 
underwent some overhaul, 
but the narrative coming into 
the season was exaggerated. 
The conference this season 
is deeper than first thought 
and features a number of 
quality teams. In fact, for 
the first time since the 2014-
15 season, the current AP 
Top 25 includes six Big Ten 
programs — most notably No. 
9 Maryland, No. 17 Michigan 
State and No. 20 Rutgers, who 
currently sit atop the Big Ten 
standings.
Though 
Thome 
and 
Munger have been everything 
they were chalked up to be as 
leaders, they have struggled 
at times with injury and 
inconsistency. Their offensive 
output hasn’t been able to 
replace Flaherty’s on a clear 
one-to-one basis, but then 
again it may have been naive 
to think it could.
To a similar extent, this 
highly touted freshman class 
has shown signs of brilliance, 
but as expected has also 
shown signs of inexperience. 
Dilk and Hillmon, specifically, 
have 
been 
thrust 
into 
prominent roles. While this 
will undoubtedly serve them 

well in the future, with the 
ball-handling duties placed on 
Dilk’s shoulders, she has been 
error-prone.
After a 19-point outing 
against 
Washington, 
in 
which she shot 7-for-11 from 
the field, Dilk accounted for 
nine turnovers and shot 14.2 
percent in the next two games 
— 
signs 
of 
improvement 
followed by clear growing 
pains.
Michigan’s 
up-and-down 
performances 
this 
season 
have culminated in an overall 
record of 11-6 and a 2-3 record 
in the Big Ten — good for sixth 
place thus far. According 
to multiple projections, the 
Wolverines aren’t slated to 
make the NCAA Tournament 
this season. At this point last 
year, Michigan was 15-4 and 
in the midst of a six-game 
win streak against Big Ten 
opponents.
The depth of the Big Ten 
affords Michigan a few more 
notable opportunities to make 
its case for the tournament, 
but 
those 
chances 
are 
dwindling. Thursday’s trip to 
take on Megan Gustafson and 
the No. 22 Iowa Hawkeyes is 
the start of a five-game run 
which includes four ranked 
opponents. If Michigan is to 
save its season, it will come 
down to the results of this 
stretch.
The 
Wolverines 
have 
alternated between success 
and defeat in their five games 
against Big Ten opponents 
thus far. They can no longer 
afford such deviations.
While 
they 
challenged 
themselves out of conference, 
the results of those games 
weren’t 
good 
enough 
to 
compensate 
for 
lackluster 
performances in the Big Ten.
So no, it’s not time to 
press the panic button on 
Michigan’s season, but there 
is a figurative finger hovering 
over it. The coming weeks 
decide everything.

ALEXANDRIA POMPEI/Daily
Kim Barnes Arico and Michigan are facing a crucial five-game stretch.

New Year, new Lavigne: Michigan goaltender shows signs of resurgence

For most, New Year’s marks 
a time of change.
For 
Michigan 
junior 
goaltender Hayden Lavigne, 
the change came a little 
earlier. With a .870 save 
percentage up from October 
to December, it was no secret 
he had struggled in net while 
fighting for playing time.
That was, until winter 
break 
hit, 
when 
Lavigne 
decided to flip a switch.
“You could see it just in 
practice, his intensity, his 
work ethic,” said Michigan 
coach Mel Pearson. “proHe 
turned the corner just before 
Christmas, and then we’ve 
seen it in practice.”
Practice was where he made 
his mark — for good and bad. 
When the season first began, 
the starting goaltending spot 
was his to lose. After all, 
former Wolverine goaltender 
Jack 
LaFontaine 
had 
transferred, and the backups 
were two freshmen with no 
collegiate experience. But the 
effects of a guaranteed start 
had a negative impact on his 
development.
Lavigne — tall and athletic 
— normally created separation 
from every other goaltender 
not through talent and skill 
alone, but through the way 
he worked hard and attacked 
practice. 
He 
was 
competitive 
to 
the 
point 
where 
allowing 
goals 
during 
practice 
angered him.
Yet, despite 
his work ethic, 
he lost focus 
in the midst of 
his job’s security.
“I think when he first came 
back this year, little sloppy 
in practice,” Pearson said. 

“Didn’t bear down as well as 
he should have or could have. 
I don’t know if he thought 
he’d show up, and it’d just be 
like last year.”
It was the coaches that 
made 
him 
realize 
things 
weren’t going to be easy, 
whether he was prepared or 
not.
“I think I kind of realized 
with some help from the 
coaches, that my practices, 
the first little bit of the season, 
probably weren’t where they 
needed to be in terms of out 
of tune, frustration, stuff like 
that,” Lavigne said.
As he returned to the ice in 
2019, he set a goal to change up 
his practice mindset — keep 
his head down, work hard 
and try to stop every puck no 
matter what. Compared to 
the first half of the season, it 
was a new Hayden Lavigne.
Even if drills didn’t go his 
way, even if goals seemed to 
go in in practice, he didn’t 
worry. And that was the key 
to 
Lavigne’s 
confidence, 
which showed early, when 
he was given the start in a 
crucial game against then-
No. 6 Notre Dame.
His performance — 30 saves 
on a .889 save percentage — 
led to Michigan’s first win 
in over a month. The two 
goals were on defensive slip-
ups late in the third period 
that stained an otherwise 
good game for 
Lavigne.
“I 
think 
those practices, 
my 
chance 
in 
the 
practice 
mindset, 
has 
really led on to 
that strong foot 
forward so far 
this new year,” 
Lavigne 
said. 
“My goal is to 
go out every day in practice 
and work hard and gain the 
confidence 
to 
know 
that 
when I go into the weekend, I 

can beat anybody and shut out 
anybody on a given night.”
Even after the win, Lavigne 
wasn’t content.
It was a quality that Pearson 
noted and appreciated.
“That’s what I like about 
him, 
he’s 
not 
satisfied,” 
Pearson said. “He’s maybe 
happy about his performance, 
but he’s not satisfied, and 
that’s how he has to be, that’s 
how his teammates have to be 
too, but Hayden is taking that 
approach so good for him.
“He had a great second half 
last year. So far, he’s off to a 
real good start this year, so 
we’re hoping for more of the 
same from him, and we know 
he can do it.”
Unlike teammate Strauss 
Mann, Lavigne had done 

it before, and been in it 
before — when the team was 
struggling to win. He stepped 
up to the plate last season 
when the coaches needed him 
to. This year, they know he 
has the chance 
to do the same.
“It’s different 
if you haven’t 
proven 
it,” 
Pearson 
said. 
“You 
haven’t 
been there, if 
you 
haven’t 
done it, but he 
has. You know 
he’s got it in 
him, and he’s 
capable.”
After factoring his hot 
second-half-of-the-year 
performance 
last 
season 

and his showing against the 
Fighting Irish, the coaches 
decided early to start him 
back-to-back against No. 4 
Ohio State — going as far as 
resting him for the occasion 
by 
playing 
Mann 
against 
Merrimack.
“We wanted 
to sort of save 
him 
for 
the 
back-to-back 
games, and we 
gave 
Strauss 
the 
chance 
Tuesday,” 
Pearson 
said. 
“Hayden’s 
playing extremely well, and 
that’s why we went back to 
back with him.”
The rest, the confidence, 

the hard work and intense 
practices — all things that set 
the stage for him to succeed 
in the Buckeye matchup. And 
Lavigne took to it.
“He gave us a chance 
to 
(win),” 
Pearson 
said. 
“Obviously we won two of 
the three games that he’s 
played and we had a real 
good chance to win that last 
game there, we had a two-
one lead, and it’s because of 
him.”
Entering the new year, 
compared to the first half of 
the season, there was a new 
Lavigne. A goaltender who 
practiced 
hard, 
competed 
hard and gave Michigan the 
opportunity to win. But for 
Lavigne and the coaching 
staff, it was more of the same.

ust two 
of 351 
teams in 
Division I bas-
ketball remain 
unbeaten.
One is 
Virginia. The 
other is … 
well, if you’re 
reading this 
column, you 
already know the answer.
An undefeated record at this 
point in the season might imply 
some kind of otherworldly 
dominance. The Michigan 
men’s basketball team has had 
that at times, but by and large 
it hasn’t been the story of its 
season. When viewing the past 
17 games together, few season-
long trends emerge.
So what is the secret to the 
Wolverines’ success?
Answer: pre-
cisely that.
Michigan’s 
won games by 
blowing the 
doors off teams. 
It blitzed Vil-
lanova right out 
of the gate to a 
44-17 halftime 
lead and beat 
Purdue and 
Indiana on the 
strength of a dizzying first 10 
minutes. The Wolverines have 
won the hard way too, starting 
slow against Penn State and Illi-
nois before methodically grind-
ing them into a fine powder.
Michigan has had games over 
by halftime and has had to ice 
games at the free-throw line. 
It’s scored more than 80 points 
five times and under 70 five 
times. Right now, the only ques-
tion is which equally effective 
Wolverine team will show up.
“We’re such a day-to-day 
team, and I’m a day-to-day 
coach,” said John Beilein after 

Michigan’s latest triumph, an 
80-60 beatdown of Northwest-
ern on Sunday. “(The Wildcats 
are) just so good with what 
they run. They run pro sets, 
they show you one thing, they 
do another thing, and they’re 
really good defensively — they 
were leading the country in not 
giving up threes.”
The Wolverines aren’t neces-
sarily deep — just seven players 
get regular minutes. But that 
group is as balanced — five 
different players have led the 
team in scoring — and as well-
rounded as any in the country. 
Zavier Simpson and Charles 
Matthews are the defensive 
tone-setters. Jon Teske is the 
low-post anchor. Jordan Poole 
and Ignas Brazdeikis go and get 
buckets. Isaiah Livers and Eli 
Brooks bring needed versatility 
off the bench. It’s hard to imag-
ine a rotation 
without any one 
of them.
“You never 
know who can 
be the leading 
scorer on this 
team,” Mat-
thews said. “You 
never know who 
can be the lead-
ing rebounder, 
leader in assists. 
We just play to win.”
Michigan’s defense is 
unquestionably its backbone. 
The Wolverines rank in the top 
five in the country in steal rate, 
free throw rate and defensive 
rebounding rate per KenPom. 
But they rank 20th in adjusted 
offensive efficiency as well.
Michigan has areas which 
can be exploited, certainly. But 
in the same way that not all of 
the Wolverines’ strengths show 
up at once, neither do their 
weaknesses.
Just look at Sunday night’s 
victory, in which Michigan set 

the school record for most wins 
(17) to start a season.
The Wolverines’ first meeting 
with the Wildcats was a 62-60 
slugfest in Evanston. This, 
Michigan’s closest game of 
the season, was one of the few 
times its flaws were exposed 
to a degree that could cost it a 
victory.
Simpson, a career 30 percent 
3-point shooter, was lured into 
putting up five from behind the 
arc. He missed all of them and 
forced Beilein to take his best 
defender and floor general out 
of the waning moments of a 
one-possession road game. This 
was Northwestern’s formula for 
beating the Wolverines, and it 
just about worked.
On Sunday, the Wildcats 
sagged off the junior again. 

Again, it was working — until it 
wasn’t.
With 10:56 to play in the first 
half, Simpson, despite a 0-for-
2 start, canned a trey. Then 
another. And another. An off-
the-dribble midrange pull-up — 
a shot he’s taken probably once 
this year, if that. Another trey. 
And on the next possession, a 
crossover and a step-back into 
the most unlikely of heat checks 
— a 3-pointer that was one of 
those shots you simply knew 
was going in.
Meanwhile, Teske’s lack of 
outside shooting has yet to hurt 
Michigan, but Northwestern, 
seeing the 7-foot-1 center’s five 
threes in 22 attempts this sea-
son, made it clear it was fine 
with leaving him open. Teske 
shot that strategy down, going 

3-for-4 on his way to tying a 
career high with 17 points — in 
the first half.
It’s easy to forget it now, but 
3-point shooting was supposed 
to be one of the Wolverines’ 
weaknesses entering the sea-
son. Northwestern coach Chris 
Collins stated postgame that 
his team was going to live with 
Simpson and Teske firing from 
outside. What happens now that 
teams know it can kill them?
“Give those guys credit, they 
went 8-for-15 from the 3-point 
line,” Collins said. “When 
they’re shooting like that, and 
you add Charles and Jordan 
Poole and Iggy to that group, 
Livers and those guys off the 
bench, they’re going to be very 
difficult to beat.”
Added Beilein: “What we got 

to do in those situations, we got 
to find other people. ... You take 
away one thing from us, our 
hope is that we have another 
answer.”
The Wolverines almost 
always do have an answer — 
and that’s what makes beating 
them so challenging. The blue-
print for doing so, to the extent 
that there even is one, changes 
every game, and their weak-
nesses are mostly neutralized 
by their adaptability.
Want to know what that 
entails? Ask Collins.
“That’s why they’re 17-0.”

How do you beat Michigan?

“We’re such a 

day-to-day team, 

and I’m a day-to-

day coach.”

This is still Zavier Simpson’s team

Z

avier 
Simp-
son’s 
table wasn’t 
too crowded.
The date 
was Oct. 25, 
2017, the 
setting was 
Michigan 
men’s basket-
ball media 
day and the topic of conversation 
was the point-guard position. 
As it related to Simpson though, 
the question was not so much 
one of what but of when. Jaaron 
Simmons had been brought in as 
a graduate transfer, and it was 
only a matter of time before he 
supplanted Simpson as the start-

er. So the thinking went.
Asking around that day 
though, a kind of character 
began to emerge. Jordan Poole 
recounted a story of Simpson 
stealing the ball in a walk-
through, keeping the intensity 
high. Assistant coach DeAndre 
Haynes couldn’t recall a time in 
practice that Simpson’s team was 
losing. Finally, a question was 
posed to Simpson.
Who has the loudest voices on 
the team?
“Loudest voices,” he said, 
hesitating. “Loudest voices on 
the team. Ummm, lemme take a 
look.”
He leaned back in his chair, 
scanning the room.
“Lemme take a look. I’m 

gonna let my man — I’m gonna 
let my people answer this. I’ll let 
Naji (Ozeir) and Luke (Wilson) 
answer this.”
It didn’t take much thinking 
from Wilson.
“You’re looking at him right 
now,” he said.
In the last 15 months, that 
image has grown to a crescendo. 
Simpson was the catalyst of 
the Wolverines’ rebranding as 
a defensive-oriented team last 
year. He out-willed Michigan 
State’s Cassius Winston — not 
once, but twice — gaining 
personal vindication against 
a player John Beilein initially 
recruited ahead of him. He is the 
internal voice leading a team that 
not only made the national title 

game but has won 17 straight 
games to start this season.
On that media day though, 
Simpson was a 6-foot guard who 
shot below 40 percent from the 
field and averaged 1.6 points per 
game his freshman season — a 
direct result of his being 6-foot.
For the early part of his 
sophomore season, Michigan’s 
offense ground to a halt with 
Simpson on the floor. In Maui, he 
was benched for Eli Brooks, and 
Simmons still lurked as a veteran 
presence with scoring ability. 
Then, suddenly, things changed.
Simpson changed his 
approach to finishing at the rim, 
learning to go around bigger 
defenders in lieu of going over. 
He got his starting spot back. 

You know the rest.
The endpoint to that change 
in his inside shooting has come 
more recently, 
in the form of a 
suddenly lethal 
sky-hook. Finish-
ing is no longer a 
semblance of an 
issue — Simpson 
obliterated that 
challenge.
That takes us 
to Sunday, when 
Northwestern 
played Simpson 
to shoot. The Wildcats had done 
the same thing in December, 
with success, and, at first, it 
worked again. Then something 
clicked, and Simpson, a career 30 
percent shooter from three, went 
5-of-10, catalyzing a blowout.
Predictably, the questions 
afterward focused on that night. 
Beilein obliged at first, but then 
decided to offer a bigger-picture 
assessment.
“No — this young man is really 
special,” Beilein said. “As far as 
the type of grit and determina-
tion he has. You put a challenge 
in front of Zavier Simpson and 
he’s gonna eventually win. Time 
will run out sometimes in life, 
but he will eventually win if 
there’s a big challenge in front 
of him. And so that’s what it 
is. You challenge him, say you 
can’t — he gives some pretty 
good stares to people after he 
scores. Over them, around them, 
under them... He’s gonna beat 
the odds.”
That goes beyond Simpson 
though. The Wolverines embody 
that mindset. They took it to a 
Final Four last year. They’ve 
taken it through 17 games this 
year and the results have been 
pretty good.
This is a group that has lost 
just once since Feb. 11, 2018 and, 
remarkably, has rarely looked 
dominant in doing so. For every 
win in which Michigan has 
blown out North Carolina or 
Texas A&M, there’s another 
in which it has methodically 

ground SUNY Binghamton into 
dust.
It’s a culture that takes every 
stereotype 
coaches love to 
preach, then 
lives them.
“A positive 
culture just 
breeds itself,” 
Beilein said. 
“The impact 
that Charles 
Matthews has 
had on this pro-
gram — just play 
defense. And Zavier, coming in 
here and just saying, ‘I’m gonna 
find my way on the court and just 
play defense.’ The impact it has 
on the young guys that they look 
around and all the veterans are 
shooting before and after prac-
tice. They’re there early. They 
leave late.
“I think people notice, there’s 
one proven formula for improve-
ment. Not how fast you do — can 
be differential. There’s one prov-
en formula, and it’s hard work. 
And that’s what our kids do, with 
limited distractions. Right? Kids 
don’t miss class. We’re not run-
ning them. We don’t have issues 
in practice. And they’re still 
young kids. But at the same time, 
that’s been a big thing, too. When 
you don’t have a lot of distrac-
tions, you’re really allowed to 
coach a team.”
A few minutes before Beilein 
came to the podium, Simpson 
had been asked about his own 
role in creating that culture. He 
cut off the question.
“I just play,” he said. “Every 
single day, I wanna just get bet-
ter with my team. Practice, I take 
one day at a time. I don’t worry 
about the next day. I compete 
like it’s the first play. Like I’m 
competing for a starting spot.”
It’s a cliché. But it’s his cliché. 
One that his team embodies.
