Event outlines 

how students can 

participate in 

festivities

By TIM COHN

Daily Staff Reporter

On Tuesday, the University 

of 
Michigan 
Bicentennial 

Office and Center for Campus 
Involvement 
hosted 
an 

informational 
workshop 
at 

the Michigan League to help 
student organizations plan for 
upcoming bicentennial events 
in 2017. 

In 
total, 
the 
University 

Bicentennial Office is planning 
to grant a total of $300,000 to 
student organizations that host 
a bicentennial-themed event in 
2017.

Bailey 
Oland, 
an 

administrative assistant senior 
at the University Bicentennial 
Office, hosted the event along 
with Nick Smith from the Center 
for Campus Involvement. 

Oland 
highlighted 
the 

different 
events 
that 
will 

take place during the year-
long bicentennial celebration. 
Among other events included a 
2017 Spring Festival, which will 
take place in early April and will 
feature a tree-planting event, a 
show hosted by the School of 
Music, Theatre & Dance, and a 
celebration of the University’s 
community of cultures that will 
feature the University’s historic 
relationship between different 
ethnic communities on campus.

Several 
other 
themed 

festivals will include a summer 
festival in June to celebrate 
staff appreciation and a Detroit 
festival in September to honor 
the University’s founding in 
Detroit and the University’s 
relationship with the city. The 
bicentennial is slated to end 
with a time capsule dedication 
and a Third Century Expo in 
the style of a World’s Fair that 
will focus on the future of the 
University.

Student rights and 
safety on campus 
focus of assembly’s 

final meeting, 

By JENNIFER MEER

Daily Staff Reporter

At Tuesday’s Central Student 

Government 
meeting, 
a 
new 

resolution to promote the safety 
of Muslim and other minority 

groups on campus by making 
the University of Michigan a 
sanctuary campus for immigrants 
took center stage.

The resolution, following an 

incident of anti-Islam chalking on 
the Diag last week, was discussed 
at length and ultimately split into 
two separate resolutions that were 
passed.

The 
resolutions 
affirms 

students’ 
rights 
of 
religious 

expression, such as the right to 
wear a hijab in any setting It also 
calls for CSG to recognize the 

University’s campus as a safe 
space on campus for immigrant 
students.

LSA 
representative 
Samer 

Alkhalili, an LSA junior who 
presented the resolution on the 
behalf of its authors, emphasized 
the 
University’s 
responsibility 

to protect its Muslim students, 
especially in the aftermath of the 
chalk messages on the Diag.

“In this resolution, we want 

to reach out to students,” he said. 
“A lot of the students I’ve talked 
to have been traumatized by this 

event. They don’t even want to 
leave their homes to go to class. At 
an institution like the University 
of Michigan, which prides itself 
in the core tenets of diversity, it’s 
unacceptable that we’re choosing 
to abstain from taking part in this 
conversation.”

Fourteen students spoke on 

behalf of the resolution during the 
Community Concerns portion of 
the meeting before the resolution 
was brought to the floor.

About a dozen members of 

the University of Michigan’s 
Michigan Political Union — 
a student-run organization 
that aims to create a space 
for students on campus to 
discuss political issues — 
gathered Tuesday night at 
the Michigan Union for their 
final debate of the semester.

Members discussed a wide 

array of topics, including 
issues of free speech, student 
diversity and bipartisanship, 
as well as responded to 
questions from attendees.

LSA 
freshman 
Liam 

Stewart, 
member 
of 
the 

Michigan 
Political 
Union, 

touched 
on 
issues 
of 

unregulated free speech in 
his comments at the event. 

He said his remarks were 
motivated 
by 
a 
personal 

encounter from earlier that 
day, when he passed a group 
of four individuals protesting 
on campus against what they 
characterized as racist hate 
speech.

“The gist of their belief is 

that people who spout racist 
hate speech should not be 
protected, 
they 
shouldn’t 

have the right to free speech, 
the 
University 
should 

sanction against them and 
oppose their right to speech,” 
Stewart said. “That people 
who wrote things like last 
week the ‘Stop Islam’ posts 
… should be expelled from 
campus.”

Last Wednesday, a number 

of religiously- and politically-
driven 
statements 
were 

written in chalk on the Diag, 
including phrases such as 
“#Stop Islam,” “Trump 2016” 
and “Build the Wall.” The 
statements sparked at least 
one call to University Police 
and an effort by students to 
wash the phrases away.

Four representatives from 

the University of Michigan 
community discussed social 
justice issues on campus with 

an 
emphasis 
on 
feminism 

and multiculturalism a panel 
Tuesday night.

Panelists 
for 
the 
event, 

hosted by student organization 
Lean In University of Michigan 
were chosen for their unique 
views on diversity, according 
to organizers. The group is 
tied to a nationwide nonprofit 
of the same name, which 
aims 
to 
increase 
dialogue 

around gender equity. The 
panel was attended by about 
100 University of Michigan 

students, faculty and staff.

Business 
junior 
Kelsey 

Hayes, one of two Lean In 
co-directors 
of 
internal 

operations, said Lean In focuses 
on various forms of diversity 
because these movements are 
intertwined with each other.

“Lean

is 
all 
about 

bringing diverse perspectives 
to tell a story about how we 
can all achieve a more equal

said she saw the Wallace House’s 
mission as important for the 
complexity of media today, and 
was looking forward to the 
position.

“It is an honor to build on Charles 

Eisendrath’s strong legacy, the 
program’s international focus and 
its connection to the University 
of Michigan,” she said. “I look 
forward to expanding Wallace 
House’s role in supporting media 
innovation and experimentation 
and being a prominent force for 
good in sustaining journalists of 
all sorts in their mission, passion 
and craft.”

On Tuesday, the National Center 

for Manufacturing Science and 
the University of Michigan hosted 
Michigan Robotics Day at the North 
Campus Research Complex, a free 
event held to showcase advancements 
made by Michigan companies and 
research organizations such as space 
robotics and autonomous vehicles.

The day was comprised of 

keynotes, demonstrations and 
networking opportunities, aimed 
to offer students an opportunity to 
peer into the world of innovative 
technology.

Danny Ellis, co-founder and CEO 

at SkySpecs, and Bob Richards from 
Stockbridge Robotics spoke at the 
event. 

Last year, the day drew nearly 

650 students, as well as some younger 
attendees. The host organization, MI 
Robotics, tweeted a video of a group 
of younger attendees playing with 
some of the many robots exhibited at 
the event.

According to the event’s website, 

the center’s goals for the day 
were to demonstrate the United 
States’ involvement in the latest 
technological developments and 
to increase funding for robotics 

research and science-, technology-, 
engineering- and math-related fields.
The University of Michigan’s goals 
were similary — raising awareness 
and advocating for Michigan’s 
technological strengths and aim to 
“raise awareness of regional robotics 
capabilities (and) Promote Michigan 
STEM and industry strengths,” 
according to their website. 

Some of the presentations 

garnered such attention beyond 
campus, including a tweet from 
U.S. Manufacturing in response to 
one of the presentations made by 
Chris Brewer, chief engineer at Ford 
Motor Company, about autonomous 
vehicles.

Two lawsuits over deer cull 
reemerge during City Council

Litigation against 
Ann Arbor come 
up during Monday 

meeting

By BRIAN KUANG

Daily Staff Reporter

Though the first iteration of 

the controversial Ann Arbor 
deer cull ended early March, 
two lawsuits about the cull 
remain active.

Discussion about both suits 

filed by the anti-cull group 
Ann Arbor residents for Public 
Safety, one in federal court 
and one in the Michigan Court 
of Claims, was renewed this 
week when anti-cull residents 
appeared at Monday’s City 
Council meeting.

Both lawsuits charge that the 

respective entities within the 
court’s jurisdiction — the city, 
state or federal government 
— proceeded with the cull 
illegally

At Monday’s meeting, City 

Attorney 
Stephen 
Postema 

said the final ruling from 
Federal Judge Arthur Tarnow 

on the case in federal court is 
expected soon. He also briefed 
Council on the state case, filed 
in February.

According to court records, 

the city, state and federal 
defendants in the federal case 
all filed motions with the 
U.S. District Court of Eastern 
Michigan to dismiss the case 
between Jan. 29 and Feb. 10, 
on the basis that no laws were 
being violated by the cull and 
the plaintiffs lacked standing 
to proceed. The presiding judge 
ordered the plaintiffs to file a 
response to these motions by 
Tuesday, but the records do not 
show any such response by the 
plaintiffs being filed.

In January, Tarnow rejected 

a claim from the Ann Arbor 
Residents for Public Safety for 
a temporary restraining order 
on the cull, saying the plaintiffs 
failed to prove there would be 
immediate 
and 
irreversible 

harm if the cull was not stopped 
before a final ruling on the suit.

State court records show 

the plaintiffs also requested an 
emergency restraining order to 
immediately halt the cull in the 
case filed with the Michigan 
Court of Claims, which was 

denied on Feb. 18.

In 
a 
March 
interview, 

Barry Powers — the attorney 
representing the plaintiffs in 
both these cases — said the 
second 
lawsuit 
specifically 

targets the state by charging 
that the Michigan Department 
of Natural Resources illegally 
overstepped 
state 
laws 

regarding 
urban 
culling 

and ceded power to the city 
government.

“We’re 
arguing 
that 
the 

state, by ceding this power to 
this municipality, is not doing 
what it’s supposed to do … 
and now you have the city of 
Ann Arbor calling the shots,” 
Powers said. “If the hunting 
laws are not good enough to 
control (the deer population) 
through extending the open 
season and increasing the bag 
limit of deer during the hunting 
season, then you need a specific 
ad-hoc approach to it and you 
need state laws to cover it.”

Powers said the immediate 

goal of the new suit is to halt 
all subsequent iterations of the 
Ann Arbor cull, but his ultimate 
goal is to force consistent 
rule of law regarding wildlife

discussed 
the 
issue, 
CSG 

President-elect David Schafer, 
an LSA junior, said the body 
should advocate for and further 
the kind of action described in 
the resolution in their capacity as 
representatives of students.

“I think CSG affirming its 

support in standing and solidarity 
with students who were targeted 
over the last week, but more 
especially 
throughout 
their 

entire time at the University — 
it’s of the utmost importance,” 
he 
said. 
“Students 
obviously 

can’t turn to the administration 
because we saw the University 
administration’s response, or lack 
thereof, last week.”

After the chalking, University 

spokesman 
Rick 
Fitzgerald 

released a statement saying the 
University was committed to 
creating an inclusive climate. 
According to Fitzgerald, bias 
response 
teams 
from 
the 

University looked into the incident 
when it was first reported.

“We all understand that where 

speech is free it will sometimes 
wound,” Fitzgerald said in the 
statement. “But our message is 
this: We are fully committed 
to 
fostering 
an 
environment 

that is welcoming and inclusive 
of everyone. Tonight we are 
reminded there is much work yet 
to be done.”

Another 
new 
resolution 

brought to the body for the first 
time Tuesday night was also 
passed. The resolution called for 
supporting the inclusion of gender 
pronouns students prefer with 
their legal name in all University-
related settings.

The resolution also asked the 

body to send an e-mail out to 
students informing them of the 
ability to specify their preferred 
pronouns.

LSA sophomore Nick Meier, 

co-author 
of 
the 
resolution, 

said according to the Office of 
the Registrar, this would not 
be difficult to incorporate on 
Wolverine Access.

“If a professor or a GSI gets 

the name and picture of every 
student, they should as well get 
their preferred pronouns,” he 
said.

that well because we don’t do a 
good enough job of promoting 
ourselves.” Oland said. “For our 
exploration into past tensions, 
we understand that it can be a 
difficult theme to talk about, 
but we are really trying to push 
that. It is important that the 
bicentennial isn’t just a year-
long celebration and a party all 
the time. But we want to show 
that we have made mistakes in 
the past, and have learned and 
grown from them.”

Student 
organizations 

were advised to tailor their 
bicentennial events to the six 
themes 
of 
the 
celebration: 

serving the people, pursuing 
ideas, creating and inventing, 

teaching 
powerfully, 

challenging society and forever 
hailing.

In discussing each them, 

Oland 
emphasized 
the 

importance 
of 
serving 
the 

people, which he said, aims 
to 
commemorate 
both 
the 

University’s history of public 
outreach, 
as 
well 
as 
the 

community 
involvement 
of 

student organizations.

The themes of pursuing ideas 

and 
creating 
and 
inventing 

themes are a celebration of the 
creation of new ideas through 
research 
and 
innovation 
at 

the University, Oland added, 
saying bicentennial activities 
by student organizations can 
focus on the role of innovative 
thinking and ingenuity at the 
University.

Among the other themes, 

Oland said challenging society 
and powerfully teaching aims 
to 
showcase 
how 
different 

areas of the University have 
shirked conventional thinking 
to promote new ideas. He 
characterized the final theme 
of the bicentennial, forever 
hailing, as a celebration of 
school 
spirit 
incorporating 

groups such as the University’s 
athletic 
departments 
and 

popular clubs.

Student organizations raised 

multiple potential issues they 
wanted to work on during a 
Q&A session after the event, 
including 
integrating 
North 

Campus into the University 
bicentennial,improving 
social 

media outreach and engaging 
the Ann Arbor community were 
the focus of a Q&A session.

Engineering 
junior 
Eve 

Gendron, 
a 
bicentennial 

representative 
from 
the 

College of Engineering Student 
Government, said she thought 
bringing Engineering related 
events 
to 
Central 
Campus 

will be a focus of the student 
government.

“The World-Fair style event 

in the fall of 2017 will be a great 
opportunity to bring student 
project teams to showcase their 
designs,” Gendron said. “Events 
like that will be important 
because it will allow students 
from all over campus to see 
what happens on all corners of 
campus, and that’s really what 
the bicentennial celebration is 
all about.”

In response to the incident, 

University spokesman Rick 
Fitzgerald emphasized the 
balance between free speech 
and inclusion on campus.

“We all understand that 

where speech is free it will 
sometimes wound,” he said. 
“But our message is this: 
We are fully committed to 
fostering an environment that 
is welcoming and inclusive 
of everyone. Tonight we are 
reminded there is much work 
yet to be done.”

Stewart largely based his 

remarks on the protesters, 
who he said were calling 
for the University to take 
disciplinary action against 
students who spread hate 
speech, such as the messages 
written on the Diag, and 
asking 
students 
to 
sign 

a petition to that effect. 
Though 
emphasizing 
that 

the statements written on 
the Diag Wednesday were 
“awful and Islamophobic,” 
he said expelling students 
for such an offense would set 
a dangerous precedent for 
limiting free speech.

“We 
all 
just 
have 
an 

opinion that we want to 
voice and that’s an important 
part of democracy,” Stewart 
said. 
“The 
second 
you 

start silencing people, you 
make a move toward an 
authoritarian 
government, 

and it’s not anybody’s right to 
decide who does and does not 
get silenced.”

He added that he disagreed 

with the idea that violence 
results from hate speech, 
noting that if someone were 
explicitly to make a call to 
violence, then free speech 
protections already would 
not apply.

“My primary concern is 

that we end up in a society 
where the government can 
step in and say, ‘Hey this 

multiculturalism and diversity 
because you recognize that 
these issues are intersectional, 
and we have to work together to 
solve them.”

When 
asked 
about 
the 

importance 
of 
diversity 
on 

campus, 
Virginia 
Lozano, 

an alum of the School of 
Art 
& 
Design, 
warned 

against 
simply 
increasing 

percentages, 
stressing 
the 

need for integration. She and 
her sister, Beatriz Lozano, are 
co-founders of Leesta, an online 
platform that teaches history 
to elementary school children 
through 
the 
perspective 
of 

women. 
Virginia 
Lozano 
is 

also a former Michigan Daily 
photographer.

“It’s easy to get caught up in 

numbers,” she said. “But who’s 
to say that someone in the class 
actually feel like they’re part of 
the entire campus? And I think 
it’s the inclusion part of diversity 
that needs to be focused on.”

The panelists were also asked 

to define political correctness 
and 
discuss 
their 
position 

on it. Art & Design senior 
Beatriz Lozano said political 
correctness is not asking too 
much of the public, adding 
that those who reject political 
correctness 
are 
behaving 

selfishly.

“Unfortunately, 
a 
lot 
of 

people are more concentrated 
about being called racist, being 
called sexist or giving off a bad 
image than they are about really 
hurting somebody,” she said.

Speaking 
to 
instances 
of 

racism and sexism, School of 

Education Prof. Debi Khasnabis 
discussed the significance of 
identity, saying it formed much 
of her path in life. Recounting 
her experience as one of the very 
few minorities in her elementary 
school, she said she was bullied 
for her skin color but found 
comfort on the weekends in her 
Indian immigrant community. 
Relating her experiences to 
the University, she emphasized 
the 
importance 
of 
locating 

marginalized individuals in the 
classroom.

“Who’s not feeling like they 

belong here?” Khasnabis asked. 
“Who’s feeling marginalized? 
Who’s feeling left out? Who’s 
feeling unheard? Who’s feeling 
voiceless? And in any space 
you go, and I guarantee you, 
someone feels that way, always. 
And it’s up to us, it’s up to the 
people who feel they belong, 
that they have some power and 
privilege in that space, to try to 
do something about it.”

Dennis Hayes, a resident 

of Allen Park, Mich., said he 
found Khasnabis’ life story most 
memorable, for he was always 
the majority.

“(Khasnabis’ experience is) 

a very scary thought, when you 
think about it,” he said. “It’s 
hard for us to understand, but 
it was telling that she gave that 
story and see how she’s moved 
in her professional development 
away from that and helping 
people to overcome what she 
had to endure herself.”

Scott Page, a professor of 

complex 
systems, 
political 

science and economics, touched 
on marginalization and the 
challenges students often face 
through cultural differences, 
pointing 
to 
his 
family’s 

experience 
while 
living 
in 

France.

“Anytime two kids saw each 

other, they would rub hands like 
this and bump fists,” he said. 
“This is for any kid regardless 
of 
social 
class. 
There’s 
a 

strong sense of inclusion and 
community.”

He said these experiences in 

France caused him to realize 
there is a significant difference 
in 
awareness 
of 
privilege 

between the United States and 
France.

Education junior Samantha 

Suh said the panelists’ advice 
to place oneself in groups with 
different people resonated with 
her, adding that her experiences 
as an active member of the Asian 
American community helped 
her form opinions similar to 
those of the panelists.

“Real change can happen 

when you cross communities,” 
she said. “When you push 
yourself 
into 
communities 

that you don’t feel comfortable 
in, that is where most of the 
learning is going to happen.”

Business 
junior 
Sushmita 

Mukherjee, Lean In’s other 
co-director 
of 
internal 

operations, emphasized that the 
event could teach people that 
change happens one person at a 
time.

“Lean 
In 
is 
all 
about 

empowering individuals, and 
a lot of the time because these 
institutionalized 
structures 

that 
give 
rise 
to 
sexism, 

racism, classism … you feel very 
helpless. But this conversation 
is aimed to say that, ‘Hey, even 
though sometimes these things 
are institutionalized, you can do 
something about it,’ ” she said.

could potentially lead to unrest 
and thus you’re not allowed to 
say it,’ ” Stewart said.

Students also discussed the 

issue of diversity on campus. LSA 
junior Joshua Strup, president 
of the Michigan Political Union, 
acknowledged the University 
has broadly encouraged the idea 
of diversity, but added that he 
thinks the institution is strict 
in its definition of it. He said he 
would like to see the University 
attract more student veterans 
on campus.

“We have long since promoted 

the idea of diversity, but it 
appears they don’t want to be 
diverse in their diversity,” Strup 
said. “That they want to focus 
on race and gender… they don’t 
want to encourage diversity of 
thought. Whereas veterans can 
bring this in.”

Currently, 
roughly 
1.5 

percent 
of 
the 
University’s 

student population are veterans, 
compared 
to 
3 
percent 
of 

the 
overall 
United 
States 

population.

Strup, who is a veteran, 

emphasized the University is 
veteran-friendly upon arrival. 
However, 
he 
also 
said 
it’s 

important 
just 
for 
service 

members to know the University 
is an option after separating 
from the service and entering 
the civilian world.

“I do not ask for special 

entrance requirements or any 
type 
of 
affirmative 
action 

program on behalf of veterans,” 
Strup said. “What I would 
like to see the University of 
Michigan do is take part of its 
recruiting budget and make 
sure 
the 
University 
has 
a 

presence through materials at 
the different transition points 
on air bases, army posts, marine 
camps and naval ports.”

A

ccepting I was a feminist 
took me a while — probably 
longer than it should have. 

Feminists 
had 

told 
me 
time 

and again that 
if 
I 
believed 

men and women 
should be equal, 
which 
I 
did, 

then I was a 
feminist. 
But 

separating 
the 

truth 
of 
the 

movement from 
its stereotypes 
— 
the 
false 

image of hating men, the angry 
tweets and the bra I didn’t have to 
burn — did not happen overnight. 
Today, I wear the title proudly 
and I admit that I still have a lot 
to learn. And I have a feeling that 
there are about to be a lot more 
of me. Barring any substantial 
change, a Clinton-Trump general 
election is coming, and with it, the 
single best night for recruitment 
that feminism has had in modern 
history. Ignore the campaigning 
and Twitter skirmishes that will 
inevitably dominate news cycles 
and national discussion. Skip to 
October, to a debate stage in some 
university auditorium in Middle 
America. That is where it will 
start.

From Gerald Ford denying a 

Soviet presence in Eastern Europe, 
to Ronald Reagan’s famous “There 
you go again,” up to Al Gore’s sighs 
and Mitt Romney’s “binders full of 
women,” presidential debates have 
been the highest and most public 
forum for political discourse — a 
forum in which no woman has 
ever had the opportunity to speak. 
Millions watch, and if the Trump 
effect on the GOP primary debates 
are any indication, 2016 will be no 
exception. More people than ever 
will tune in to hear what comes out 
of his mouth next. Young and old, 
liberal and conservative, Black 
and white will not be able to resist 
watching the political equivalent 
of the Fight of the Century. But 
unlike Ali and Frazier, this will 
not be a fair fight.

Though he has benefited from 

the fact that he has consistently 

been the center of attention at 
every debate in some form or 
another, Trump’s debating skills 
over the course of the primary 
season have pleased few other 
than his supporters. He attacks 
wildly and without caution, as 
he did with Ted Cruz: “I know 
you’re 
embarrassed. 
I 
know 

you’re embarrassed … I’m relaxed. 
You’re the basket case.” If anyone 
boos, he chalks it up to a biased 
audience. He has blatantly lied, 
insulted moderators and made 
explicit reference to the size of 
his manhood, all on national 
television. And a lot of it has 
worked thus far.

His antics in these contests have 

been what makes him endearing 
to the portion of the Republican 
base that hates the establishment 
and the media, supporters who 
love to hear someone speak their 
mind and lambast the evil that is 
political correctness. If there is 
one thing Trump knows, it is how 
to market himself. But this cannot 
continue in a general election. The 
strategy that has catapulted him to 
the top of a fragmented GOP field 
will not work with independents, 
moderates, swing state voters and 
the vast majority of Americans 
who disapprove of Trump. Keep 
in mind the fact that, with the 
notable exception of Megyn Kelly, 
no one has held him accountable 
for his sexist remarks. Since their 
confrontation in the first debate, 
Trump has avoided this “third-
rate reporter” at all costs, refusing 
to participate in debates where 
she, and her questions on behalf of 
women, were present. In a contest 
based around looking “presidential,” 
knowledgeable and relatable yet 
strong, Trump’s infantile behavior 
will pale in comparison to Hillary’s 
calm and collected presentation. 
My golden retriever would look 
presidential next to the GOP front-
runner, but I digress.

Feminists could not have written 

a more symbolic showdown. On 
one side, a man who has degraded 
women, reduced them to their 
appearances and last week said that 
exercising their constitutional right 
to have an abortion should result 
in “some form of punishment.” 

On the other, a composed and 
capable 
woman 
with 
one 
of 

the most impressive resumés 
in the history of presidential 
candidates. Someone who has, 
throughout her career, promoted 
reproductive rights, equal pay 
and family paid leave.

Whether Hillary Clinton is 

the ideal icon for feminism in 
the 21st century or not is still 
up for debate. Regardless, she 
will be the champion of every 
American 
woman 
when 
she 

inevitably takes on Trump and 
his rhetoric. In living rooms 
and at dinner tables across the 
country, conversations will be 
sparked by the simple truth 
that sexism is alive and well. It 
will have a name, a face and an 
unconvincing head of hair.

Discrimination based on race, 

religion, sexual orientation and 
gender identity are more easily 
identifiable. 
Just 
watch 
the 

news. Sexism, on the other hand, 
hides. It exists in the socially 
acceptable forms of slut shaming, 
in 
the 
unequal 
expectations 

about marriage and children, 
in the double standards about 
displaying emotion in public, 
and in countless other nooks and 
crannies of our national culture.

When 
I 
imagine 
what 
a 

Trump/Clinton 
debate 
might 

look like, I see a place where 
sexism cannot hide. Under the 
bright lights and scrutiny of 
millions of Americans, as he 
tries to score points with his 
base of predominantly angry 
white men, Trump’s shocking 
disrespect for more than half 
of the voting public will not be 
funny or entertaining. It will 
be disturbing — a wakeup call 
to those who have chuckled at 
“meninism” 
on 
social 
media 

and, like I did as a first-semester 
freshman, refused to use the F 
word. So no matter which party 
wins the House or the Senate or 
the White House, I will make 
one prediction about the 2016 
election cycle with confidence: 
Feminism will win.

The F-word in 2016

Though 
the 
most 
common 

narrative 
surrounding 
sexual 

violence and intimate partner abuse 
tends to focus on heterosexual 
relationships 
with 
a 
female 

survivor and a male perpetrator, it’s 
important to remember that these 
issues affect relationships between 
people of all social identities. In 
fact, according to a 2010 survey 
conducted by the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention, 
rates of sexual violence were much 
higher among lesbian women, gay 
men and bisexual men and women 
than among heterosexual people.

The 
survey 
reports 
that 

approximately 13 percent of lesbian 
women and a whopping 46 percent 
of bisexual women reported having 
been raped at some point in their 
lives. Forty percent of gay men and 
47 percent of bisexual men reported 
experiencing sexual violence other 
than rape. Compared to 17 percent 
of heterosexual women reporting 
rape and 21 percent of heterosexual 
men reporting other kinds of sexual 
violence, 
these 
statistics 
show 

that sexual violence has a major 
presence in the LGBTQ community. 
So why are LGBTQ survivor stories 
so invisible? 

When 
people 
don’t 
see 

themselves 
represented 
in 
a 

situation (in this case, among abuse 
and sexualized violence survivors), 
they tend not to identify with it. 
Many LGBTQ people are afraid 
to report their assault or to speak 

out about their abuse because they 
worry the resources available for 
survivors aren’t “for them” or feel 
they aren’t included and accepted 
in safe spaces for survivors. This 
“othering” can make the survivor 
feel further alienated by society.

Another huge barrier for LGBTQ 

people seeking resources or support 
is the gendered language that tends 
to be used when discussing assault. 
It is often implied that all survivors 
are female and all perpetrators are 
male, which, for many survivors, 
is inconsistent with their story. 
Because they do not see themselves 
accounted 
for 
in 
resources 

supporting survivors of abuse and 
assault, many LGBTQ people do not 
speak up or seek help.

Another possible reason behind 

this could be that members of the 
LGBTQ community who experience 
sexual violence are afraid to tell 
their stories due to stereotypes 
and their minority status. There’s 
a sentiment that if there is an 
issue with sexual violence in the 
community, then straight people 
will 
have 
another 
excuse 
to 

marginalize them. Other members 
of the LGBTQ community may have 
friends or family members who 
are skeptical of LGBTQ people’s 
sexuality and partner choice. This 
may cause the individual to feel 
like they have to work extra hard 
to keep up the appearances of a 
healthy relationship in order to 
make sure people have no reason 

to 
further 
disapprove 
of 
the 

relationship and, by extension, 
their sexual orientation.

There is also the fear of being 

outed. LGBTQ people who have 
been abused, but have not come 
out, fear speaking about their 
experience or seeking resources 
for help because they are not yet 
ready to be out. In the case of 
abusive relationships, the abuser 
could even use their partner’s fear 
of being outed as leverage to keep 
their partner from leaving.

With 
all 
these 
real 
issues 

and fears, what can be done to 
combat this problem? How can 
straight people — survivors or 
otherwise — be allies to the LGBTQ 
community both generally and 
in the context of sexual assault 
and intimate partner violence? 
One big step is inclusive language. 
The 
use 
of 
“partner” 
rather 

than “girlfriend” or “boyfriend” 
includes all gender identities and 
all types of relationships. Rather 
than 
gendering 
sexual 
assault 

and intimate partner violence, 
understanding that these things 
can happen to people of any and 
all social identities is crucial to 
opening up the conversation about 
domestic violence to everyone. 
Regardless of their identity, all 
survivors deserve to be heard and 
believed.

Inclusivity for LGBTQ survivors

RACHEL THURSBY | OP-ED

T

hough the anti-Islam words that 
appeared on the Diag earlier this week 
could be easily erased by a group of 

students with rags and buckets of water, the 
same cannot be said for 
the 
sentiments 
behind 

the statements, which are 
systemic and unfortunately 
long-lived.

We cannot dismiss those 

hostile messages with a 
shrug and an invocation 
of the importance of “free 
speech.” We cannot let 
the broader debate over 
“safe spaces” on college 
campuses 
obscure 
the 

fact that, whatever the 
motivation or intention, whoever wrote the 
messages gave a voice to hatred and hostility 
toward the religion of Islam and those who 
follow it. And we cannot deny that this 
Islamophobia dehumanizes and marginalizes 
millions of Muslims who are guilty of 
nothing more than being Muslims, laying the 
groundwork for persecution and violence 
toward them.

Unfortunately, this is precisely what the vast 

majority of comments on The Michigan Daily’s 
coverage of the anti-Islam chalk do. They 
attempt to dilute the maliciousness behind 
the statements and attribute the outrage that 
the words sparked to yet another round of the 
debate surrounding “safe spaces” on university 
campuses. “Look what we have here,” they seem 
to say, “another episode of anguish for those 
goddamn, cry-baby liberal students, so coddled 
that they simply can’t handle discomfort, let 
alone honest disagreement.”

Forget paraphrasing. By way of example, 

here’s what one commenter actually wrote: 
“To the darling precious snowflakes who melt 
into a shimmering puddle when they see chalk 
drawings they don’t approve of — do you EVER 
hope to get a job?? You understand that ALL 
workplaces (even university labs) are filled with 
a variety of people some of whom may have 
different perspectives and even different values 
than you.” Four other commenters nodded in 
agreement with a “like.”

Though 
the 
chalk 
writings 
were 

expressing 
a 
“perspective” 
that’s 

(thankfully) “different” than that of many, 

that’s only the beginning of the discussion 
we need to be having. At a university where 
respect, civility and equality are supposed 
to be at the core, we cannot tolerate a 
“different perspective” that’s grounded in 
ignorance and hatred of people because of 
their religion. This is a “perspective” that 
exposes Muslims to the risk of physical 
harm and hurts them in other ways that are 
just as real and equally as offensive. 

It doesn’t matter whether the inflammatory 

words were written in chalk on the Diag or 
burned into the side of Angell Hall with a 
blowtorch. They must be understood as a 
virulent attack on our community’s obligation to 
be more inclusive. To dismiss the statements as 
harmless, let alone to defend them as protected 
by concepts of “free speech,” aids those who 
would divide the University community. These 
words cannot go unchallenged.

If, instead of the anti-Islam statements, 

there had been swastikas, I strongly doubt that 
so many of the comments on the Daily’s article 
would’ve told offended Jews to “cry me a river.” 
That’s because generally, we understand and 
reject anti-Semitic remarks as harmful hate 
speech that alienates an entire population. In 
most quarters, malicious Jewish conspiracy 
theories aren’t accepted as merely expressing a 
“different perspective,” and Jewish slurs aren’t 
excused as simply an exercise of “free speech.” 
In this regard, Islamophobia is no different 
than anti-Semitism.

To be sure, freedom of speech should be 

broadly defined, particularly in an academic 
setting, where open expression of different 
ideologies, 
thoughts, 
beliefs, 
analyses, 

viewpoints — you name it — is essential 
to generating meaningful discussion of 
important but difficult issues. But the 
motivation behind the speech matters, and 
to pretend that the words on the Diag were 
inspired by anything other than hatred and 
bigotry is absurd. That doesn’t mean that 
those words can’t be uttered or written, 
even in the way they were. It just means that 
the statements, and whoever wrote them, 
deserve nothing more than to be swiftly 
condemned by both the administration and 
our community as a whole. It’s that simple.

ast Thursday, I stopped by Student 
Food Co.’s table in Mason Hall to pick 
up a few essentials, and I asked about 

the new “People’s Food 
Co-Op” bag, its price listed 
on the chalkboard at $10. 
It’s basically a paper bag 
filled with various kinds of 
healthy junk food, not really 
what I was looking for, but 
I was curious and wanted 
to know more. What made 
me take a step back was the 
way one of the girls selling 
took a moment to introduce 
the co-op to me to the point 
of 
even 
pointing 
down 

State Street in the direction of Catherine and 
Fourth Street. For any other student, someone 
who’s never heard of the co-op or who’s shopped 
there once but has only vague memories of the 
experience, this might be a perfectly normal 
gesture. For me, it felt strange simply because 
I’ve shopped at the co-op more times than I can 
count. Growing up in town, I’ve been a customer 
of the store for my entire life.

It’s understandable that one of my fellow 

students, probably someone from out of town, 
didn’t know about my far-reaching connection 
to this Ann Arbor icon. What I find interesting 
is just how little students really get to know 
this city. Over the course of four or more years 
here, people live in dorms and campus housing, 
occasionally venturing into apartments in 
more “townie”-centric neighborhoods. With 
restaurants, nightlife scenes and study spaces 
located right around campus, it makes sense 
that most students stay within a fairly small 
radius from the Diag. After all, who wants to 
walk an extra half-mile to pay extra at pricey 
Main Street eateries?

I’ve been the opposite case. As an incoming 

freshman, I knew my favorite entrée at plenty 
of spots on Main Street, but barely understood 
the location of the Diag in relation to the rest 
of town. Before enrolling at the University, all 
I saw was this other side — the “townie” side — 
of the city. I’d walked around campus a couple 
times before, so I thought I knew everything 
about the University. As I’ve discovered over my 
three years here, that wasn’t the case at all.

The University is a large and complicated place, 

very different from “real-world Ann Arbor,” as a 
fellow student remarked to me during the fall of 
my freshman year. Learning my way around this 

new part of town — where to study, how to find 
my classes, and what kind of snacks to pack for 
a long day — has been an adventure, and one I’ve 
been enjoying greatly. While my time here hasn’t 
been perfect, of course, it’s been nothing short of 
pleasurable seeing my world expanding, little by 
little, to accommodate the Chemistry Building, 
MLB, East Quad. And while I’ve lived at home 
during the fall and winter semesters, spring has 
drawn me away from the familiar more and more 
— with a weekend at the Bio Station, six weeks on 
the New England Literature Program and, this 
coming May, a month overseas.

And just as this other side of my city has slowly 

opened up to me, I hope other students have been 
exploring beyond the four “U” streets that border 
the original campus. Just as I’ve found favorite 
restaurants on South U and on State, I hope 
others will branch out to explore Main Street, 
Westgate, Traver Village or other shopping 
destinations around town.

When I enrolled at Michigan, I was still a 

townie. I’d eaten at the League and walked 
across the Diag, but without knowing their 
names. I’d studied in the Hatcher reading room, 
but probably couldn’t have located it on a map. 
It’s been through my time here, through 
walking campus and getting myself lost, that 
I’ve truly learned my way around a side of the 
city previously hidden to me. I thought I knew 
what campus looked like, what the University 
was, but I couldn’t understand all of that 
without first living the student experience in 
my day-to-day routine.

That doesn’t mean there isn’t another side 

to the city, one that I hope will be of as much 
interest to students as it is to townies. It’s 
there in the bungalows of my neighborhood, 
the Huron River, the Arb and city parks, it’s 
what makes this city Ann Arbor. It can be 
found in the public library and in downtown 
boutiques. While campus and its surrounding 
neighborhoods may technically be a part of 
town, they aren’t the same as the destinations 
for people who live here year-round. So if 
you find yourself getting tired of the same 
old sights, then break away from the throng 
and go out for a stroll on the city streets or in 
the local neighborhoods. On your way back, 
maybe you’ll even find yourself stopping into 
the People’s Food Co-Op to purchase your 
favorite healthy snack.

‘Copy’ reveals true 
genius of late Ephron

By SOPHIA KAUFMAN

Daily Arts Writer

It was a family mantra passed 

down through the matriarchs, 
starting with Jacob Bernstein’s 
grandmother: 
“Everything is 
copy.” In this 
documentary 
tribute 
to 

his 
mother, 

Nora 
Ephron, 

Bernstein 
profiles 
Ephron’s 
professional 
life 
as 
a 

journalist, 
screenwriter 
and 
director, 

using both her 
own 
words 

and those of others close to her. 
“Everything is Copy” reveals 
nothing extraordinary, but it 
is a treat to hear the profound 
respect that Ephron’s friends and 
coworkers had for her and her 
influential work.

Before 
she 
created 
the 

touchstone titles “Sleepless in 
Seattle,” 
“When 
Harry 
Met 

Sally” and “You’ve Got Mail,” 
Ephron was a journalist. In 
“Everything is Copy,” Gay Talese 
says one can’t always tell with a 
daily paper how strong of a writer 
someone is; but once Ephron 
started writing essays, everyone 
began to take notice. Her editor 
at Alfred Knopf talks about how 
she broke through a lot of glass 
ceilings. She launched herself 
into the intellectual stratosphere 
of New York City with her 
writing for Esquire Magazine, 
especially with her essays during 
the growing women’s rights 
movement, introducing people 
to feminism with succinct and 
sparkling essays that were easy 
to digest.

The quippy remarks from 

everyone who admired Ephron 
reflect her own writing. She could 
be acerbic — “she had a razor in 
her back pocket,” says one — but 
she also refused to mask any 
sympathy for her subjects when 
she felt it. The love felt for Ephron 
and her work shines through in 
the interview segments. Steven 
Spielberg says making Ephron 
laugh was like winning an Oscar. 
“She understood love, I think,” 
reflects Meryl Streep.

“Everything is Copy” follows 

Ephron’s career chronologically, 
but it is intercut with other 
figures — Lena Dunham, Gaby 
Hoffmann, Reese Witherspoon, 
Rita Wilson — reading some of 
her essays out loud. Those shots 
are black and white and simply 
framed, 
giving 
viewers 
the 

time and space to fully focus on 
Ephron’s words.

The entire documentary is 

littered with sharp, clever, biting 
remarks that Ephron has said 
throughout the years, — on the 
air or to journalists — spicing 
up Bernstein’s narration. Her 
gift for turning a phrase is made 
strikingly obvious. She cuts off 
one talk show host who is trying 
to defend Julie Nixon — about 
whom Ephron had written — 
shrewdly guessing that he nurses 
a soft spot for her. He admits it, 
smiling, asking if she doesn’t, and 
she adamantly replies, “I think 
she’s a chocolate covered spider.” 
Later on, when asked what 
makes Tom Hanks (“Sleepless in 
Seattle”) and Meg Ryan (“When 
Harry Met Sally”) the king and 
queen of romantic comedies, she 
says, “Two great brains, and the 
fact that they look like they’re 
from the same food group.”

The documentary focuses just 

as much on Ephron’s personal 
life as it does on her professional 
career, perhaps because she used 

her own life as material for her 
screenplays. The story of her 
divorce is intercut with shots 
from the film adaptation of her 
novel 
“Heartburn,” 
directed 

by Mike Nichols. Nichols talks 
about how Ephron dealt with 
being “publicly cuckolded,” an 
experience not many people 
survive. The awe in his voice is 
apparent when he relates how 
she did it.

“She moved to the Gottlieb’s 

house, cried for six months, and 
wrote it funny. And in writing 
it funny, she won. And betrayed 
women all over the world knew 
it, and cheered.”

There’s 
a 
montage 
in 

the documentary of all the 
interviewees being asked if they 
knew she was sick towards the 
end of her life. Every single one 
says no, even those working on 
“Julie and Julia,” the film with 
which Ephron had the closest 
working 
relationship. 
Nora 

Ephron died of leukemia at the 
age of 71, very rapidly. Her death 
is portrayed as a shock to the 
entire populace of New York 
City. There’s a montage of clips 
from different news sources 
and channels sharing the news 
of her death, demonstrating her 
transnational influence.

“Everything 
is 
Copy” 

would’ve 
been 
stronger 
if 

Bernstein 
had 
abstained 

from 
projecting 
his 
own 

psychoanalytic interpretation of 
his mother’s decision to keep the 
news of her sickness from people 
onto her story. But the last word 
of the documentary is “pie,” 
followed by a lazy jazz number 
that fades in and out as the end 
credits roll. It sounds strange, 
but it works. It’s the last thing 
that Ephron said she would miss 
about life in her final book, “I 
Remember Nothing and Other 
Reflections.”

Last Friday night, I set my 

alarm with one mission in mind: 
to finish Saturday’s run before 
Ann Arbor’s 45th annual Hash 
Bash began. It was still dark 
when 
I 

set 
out 

the 
next 

morn-
ing, 
but 

I 
happily 

took sleep 
depriva-
tion, cold 
fingers 
and 
scat-

tered snow 
showers 
over streets saturated with mari-
juana.

Before I offend any Hash Bash 

attendees, here’s a disclaimer: 
I very strongly (and maybe 
unfairly) despise weed.

Part of my hatred stems from 

the act of smoking itself. Like all 
runners, I prize my lungs. The 
idea of inhaling something that 
could harm my breathing makes 
me anxious. (Full disclosure: 
I was the kid who coughed 
obnoxiously whenever I passed 
someone on their cigarette break, 
convinced that secondary smoke 
would give me lung cancer.)

When I first encountered 

marijuana 
in 
high 
school, 

being a “stoner” was a persona. 
Smoking weed was relaxing, my 
classmates said. To “judgemental 
me,” they were lazy. And out of 
shape. I dismissed marijuana 
enthusiasts as gluttonous and 
sluggish — kids who were always 
on the sofa, hacking up a lung, 
Doritos in hand.

And yet, some defied the stoner 

stereotype. And they continue 
to defy it: they’re stellar cross 
country 
runners, 
swimmers, 

skiers, cyclists, rock climbers. 
Somehow, 
(despite 
several 

health risks from marijuana 
found in published studies) they 
rank among the best in their 
competitive fields.

Who 
are 
these 
athletes? 

People like Clifford Drusinsky, 
an 
venerable 
triathlete 
who 

eats an energy bar laced with 
20 milligrams of THC (the 
chemical found in marijuana) 
before a three-hour bike ride. 
Or Avery Collins, a 23-year-old 
ultrarunner from Colorado who 
recently ran a 100-mile race in 
Hawaii. In an interview with 
the Wall Street Journal, Collins 
explained his training regimen: 
he typically runs about 150 miles 
weekly and consumes weed four 
or five times each week as well.

Rather 
than 
smoking 
the 

plant, Collins uses a vaporizer, 
eats weed edibles and rubs a 
marijuana-infused balm on his 

legs, which helps numb physical 
aches from his ultra-distance 
runs. Similarly, by ingesting a 
little weed before he runs, Collins 
controls for nausea (which is 
crucial for a long run) and helps 
with the mental challenges of the 
sport. The marijuana occupies 
his mind, which reduces anxiety 
and dulls the tedium of miles.

It also helps him sleep. As 

Collins explained in the article, 
“You’re running for 17 to 20 hours 
straight, and when you stop, 
sometimes your legs and your 
brain don’t just stop ... Sometimes 
[marijuana] is the only way I can 
fall asleep after racing.”

Collins isn’t alone in his post-

running ritual. In an interview 
with Runner’s World, Jeff Serber, 
a 42-year-old runner from Los 
Angeles, called the plant his 
painkiller of choice — especially 
after two hip surgeries, a hernia 
surgery, and severe arthritis 
in his toe. He told Runner’s 
World, “You can take an Advil, 
which will help the swelling and 
inflammation, but it’s also very 
taxing on your liver ... I can’t do 
[prescription 
pain 
medicine] 

and function as a normal human 
being.”

Serber continued, “As a weed 

smoker, I can function.” 

The issue of “functioning” is 

what typically divides athletes, 
scientists and physicians (not to 
mention the rest of society) on the 
marijuana debate. Even as weed 
becomes increasingly legalized 
in states — prompting magazines 
like Outside to investigate, “Can 
Pot Make You a Better Athlete?” — 
many people are understandably 
hesitant to add marijuana to their 
workout routines, regardless of its 
supposed benefits.

Can weed be healthy? Few 

scientists have studied the effects 
of marijuana on fitness, but many 
athletes have recently “come 
out of the cannabis closet” to 
describe their experiences. What 
we do know is that THC binds 
to the cannabinoid receptors in 
our brains, which are the same 
receptors activated when we 
experience a “runner’s high.”

Whether 
our 
cannabinoids 

are hijacked naturally through 
exercise or synthetically, through 
marijuana, the “high” we feel is 
marked by “sedation, analgesia, 
mild happiness, the loss of the 
sensation of time and a loss of 
worries,” according to Runner’s 
World. 

For 
some 
weed 
smokers, 

being free of worry can be equal 
to being lazy. But for others, 
marijuana 
has 
an 
opposite 

effect: it makes athletes feel 
invincible. A skier who consumes 
weed, for example, may be 

willing to tackle terrain that 
intimidated him before. As an 
anonymous climbing guide said 
in Men’s Journal, “People have a 
stereotype of a zoned-out stoner, 
but for a lot of people, [weed] it 
makes them super-focused and 
motivated ... it’s like drinking two 
espressos.”

Obviously, there are risks 

involved with weed. For every 
one skier who focuses better 
after taking a hit, there are 
dozens whose cognitive and 
fine motor skills are negatively 
affected by the drug, putting 
them in dangerous situations (i.e. 
straight into a tree). Marijuana 
is also known to increase heart 
rate and blood flow to the brain, 
potentially causing cardiac arrest 
and stroke.

Besides 
its 
deadlier 
side 

effects, 
marijuana’s 
anxiety-

reducing 
capabilities 
and 

bronchodilating effects (which 
increases airflow to the lungs) 
prompted 
the 
World 
Anti-

Doping Agency to ban the drug 
from athletic competitions — but 
the rule is shifting. In 2013, the 
WADA raised the level of THC 
permissible for athletes, enabling 
elites to train with marijuana 
outside of competitions.

Will marijuana be the training 

supplement 
of 
the 
future? 

Unlikely. Or at least, not publicly. 
Because despite our country’s 
growing acceptance of weed, and 
despite the elite athletes who 
debunk the stoner stereotype, 
the negative stigma of marijuana 
is hard to shake — especially in 
the world of athletics.

Here’s the thing: marijuana 

isn’t banned from competition 
because 
it’s 
a 
performance 

enhancer. Weed doesn’t bother 
me, or anyone else for that 
matter, the same way steroids 
do — because smoking doesn’t 
necessarily give the athlete an 
advantage over his competitors.

But it taints the purity of the 

sport. When Olympic swimmer 
Michael Phelps was caught on 
camera smoking weed from 
a bong in 2009, it caused a 
worldwide 
uproar. 
Reporters 

fished for reasons, sponsors 
wanted 
apologies, 
parents 

labeled him a bad role model. 
One picture was all it took to take 
Phelps off the podium and into 
the streets of Hash Bash.

In the future, there may be 

concrete evidence of marijuana’s 
health benefits, particularly for 
athletes. But until then, I think 
I’ll stick with the runner’s high.

Can’t go wrong with a classic black turtleneck.

Pointless ‘Huntsman’ 
relies on stereotypes 

UNIVERSAL PICTURES

“Mom likes me better.”

By RACHEL RICHARDSON

Daily Arts Writer

Once upon a time gender roles 

weren’t accurately portrayed in 
Hollywood. 
“The 
Huntsman: 

Winter’s War” reminds us of 
those darker times, not only by 
bringing back these cringeworthy 
stereotypes, 
but 
also 
by 

regurgitating a worn-out theme.

Essentially, 
the 
insanely 

predictable narrative tries to 
emphasize how love conquers 
all. Sticking to tradition, an 
overly 
optimistic 
sounding 

narrator introduces us to two 
sisters, the evil queen Ravenna 
(Charlize Theron, “Mad Max: 
Fury Road”) and her nicer (but 
not nice) sister, Freya (Emily 
Blunt, “Sicario”). After a series 

of unfortunate events, Freya 
deserts her homeland to start her 
own kingdom, founded on the 
idea that loving is a sin. But, of 
course, two of her citizens, Eric 
(Chris Hemsworth, “Avengers: 
Age of Ultron”) and Sara (Jessica 
Chastain, “The Martian”), fell 
deeply in love and formulate a 
plan to escape. Freya manages 
to separate them, but the couple 

inevitably reunites seven years 
later. Then, Eric, now a soldier in 
Snow White’s kingdom, is tasked 
with 
finding 

Ravenna’s 
powerful 
mirror 
before 

Freya does. To 
enhance 
the 

talent 
of 
his 

dream 
team, 

Eric 
permits 

four 
bumbling 

trolls 
to 

accompany him 
and Sara on their 
journey. All of 
the tension built 
up throughout the film culminates 
in Freya’s castle, though mostly 
everyone still manages to live 
happily ever after in the end. 

Sadly, 
“The 
Hunstman: 

Winter’s War” fails to offer 
anything new to the fairytale 
genre. 
Sara’s 
middle 
name 

might as well be Katniss, as she 
annoyingly emphasizes that she 
“never misses” with her bow 
and arrow at every opportunity. 
Katniss and Sara also share the 
unappealing quality of acting like 
a femme fatale one moment and 
a hopeless damsel in distress the 
next. As well there’s no question 
that Freya is the non-animated 
version of Elsa from “Frozen.” 
Both possess the ability to turn 
anything into an ice sculpture, 
(a power that stems from the 
coldness of their hearts.) Even the 
costuming is similar — both flaunt 

extravagant dresses that tinkle 
as they stride across their frozen 
fortresses. At least Elsa can release 
her overly exaggerated emotions 
by breaking into song — Blunt 
expresses her feelings through 
excessive whines and screeches.

Chris 
Hemsworth’s 

performance confirms why few 
people regard the Huntsman as 
a remarkable hero. Hemsworth 
ferociously 
tears 
off 
Blunt’s 

clothes during their countless 
make out scenes, portraying 
the false idea that in an ideal 
relationship, the man is allowed 
to literally and figuratively strip 
her of all she has. Not only is it 
hard to comprehend why he 
carries out most of his actions in 
the way that he does, it’s often 
difficult to discern what exactly 
Hemsworth is saying because 
of his accent, which strangely 
wasn’t an issue in any of the 
“Avengers” movies.

Even in this type of fantasy 

movie, there is a fine line 
between acceptably unreal and 
downright bizarre. Somehow the 
film manages to avoid crossing 
this line until the final duel 
between the two sisters. When 
Ravenna loses all control of her 
emotions, a disgusting black goo 
oozes from her mouth. As it drips 
off her teeth and splatters down 
her chin, she appears appear 
more like a bloodthirsty vampire 
than enraged queen. We’re made 
well aware that Freya is fully 
enraged when her pupils are 

replaced with glowing white 
spheres. While this is slightly 
less frightening, its strangeness 
is incredibly uncomfortable.

The dialogue throughout the 

entire film encourages an insane 
number of facepalms, but the 
award for worst banter goes to 
the dumb exchanges between 
Nion (Nick Frost, “Shaun of the 
Dead”) and Doreena (Alexandra 
Roach, “The Iron Lady”), the 
troll couple that can only be 
identified by their robustness 
and 
stupidity. 
Instead 
of 

achieving the intended wit by 
being clever, their conversation 
draws laughs because of its 
pathetic reliance on the liberal 
usage of contemporary double 
entendre. As the two paddle 
their canoe, which has deeper 
sexual implications in itself, 
Doreena remarks that she has 
suddenly become very thirsty. 
She then turns around when 
Nion comments that running 
also makes him thirsty. They 
then proceed to discuss how 
the saltiness of certain foods 
also increases their levels of 
thirst. 
When 
Doreena 
faces 

forward again, the smile we all 
know indicates she’s getting laid 
tonight creeps across her face.

Unlike these two bumbling 

trolls, my love life hasn’t been so 
promising lately. And while I’d 
like to make my enemies suffer, 
I’m not evil enough to cast a 
spell that would force them to sit 
through this deplorable film.

Lopez not ‘Louie’

By SHIR AVINADAV

Daily Arts Writer

Though TV Land’s new series 

“Lopez” dons yet another varia-
tion of its star George Lopez’s 
name 
as 
its 

title, it differs 
from his previ-
ous shows in 
both 
format 

and 
content. 

The comedian’s 
eponymous 
roster of shows 
typically fits the 
mold of the tra-
ditional family sitcom, but stand 
apart in the diversity of their cast 
members. Lopez is far from the 
first producer and actor to repre-
sent cultural diversity on televi-
sion, but he is still one of the first 
few to achieve success doing so.

His comedy tackles issues of 

ethnicity, cultural assimilation 
and family dynamics — topics 
that many American audiences 
can relate to but don’t often see 
on TV. However, with the slowly 
increasing diversity of network 
and cable television, as well as the 
ever-changing realm of comedy, 
the traditional sitcom has lost its 
impact as a vehicle for Lopez’s 
acute humor and commentary.

Following the lead of shows 

like “Louie” and “Curb Your 
Enthusiasm,” “Lopez” is a single-
camera comedy that parodies 
the life of its creator and star. 
Lopez’s previous shows star him 
as an everyman — the head of his 
household who’s vexed by his fam-
ily’s antics yet also serves as their 

linchpin. Like counterparts Louis 
C.K. and Larry David, Lopez pokes 
fun at himself, but does so in the 
context of being a Latino man in 
a predominantly white stratum of 
Los Angeles.

However, a well-off comedian 

whose life is rooted in Hollywood, 
Lopez doesn’t carry the same 
cultural currency as the average 
sitcom-y father figure. “Lopez” 
capitalizes on the comedian’s suc-
cess as the factor distancing him 
from his roots. The show succeeds 
in its hyperbolic, reflexive repre-
sentation of Lopez’s prosperity — 
that is, if its goal is to make Lopez’s 
character unrelatable and even 
unlikable. He spends most of the 
episode complaining about what 
his privilege affords him — like his 
daughter’s (Ashley Zamora, “Gang 
Related”) 
bourgeoisie 
private 

school and his annoying neighbors 
in their wealthy neighborhood.

Though Lopez’s character ulti-

mately refers to these issues as 
“white man problems” — pointing 
out the complete lack of aware-
ness some privileged white people 
have regarding inequality — he 
fails to explore this realization 
further. To make things worse, 
he mistakes the former mayor of 
Los Angeles for a valet, made even 
more cringeworthy by the fact 
that Lopez himself is mistaken 
for a valet at his daughter’s school 
(yes, the school has valet parking) 
earlier in the episode. Referencing 
stereotypes like the one in Lopez’s 
valet gaffe can serve as a critical 
tool for examining them in soci-
ety. But rather than engaging with 
this issue, he brushes it off, opting 

to use the moment as a platform to 
satirize his relationship with his 
publicist instead.

His publicist, a high-strung, 

social media machine, acts as 
an indicator of how out of place 
Lopez feels in Hollywood, despite 
having assimilated to his life as 
a celebrity enough to lose touch 
with his roots. At times, Lopez 
and his publicist seem to be oper-
ating on different wavelengths 
completely. This divide serves as 
an apt reflection of Hollywood’s 
superficial reality, but again posi-
tions Lopez as the out of touch 
celebrity. The satirization of his 
celebrity status is milked even 
further by a Snoop Dogg cameo. 
In a bizarre plotline that struggles 
to fit in with the rest of the epi-
sode, Snoop Dogg tries to set up 
Lopez with his Latina maid, who’s 
a fan of the comedian. This thread 
in the plot feels like an unpleasant 
return to Lopez’s sitcom humor 
and falls flat.

Despite the show’s failure to 

live up to its potential in the pre-
miere, there’s something to be 
said for Lopez’s attempts to make 
an example out of himself. The 
show doesn’t cast explicit blame 
on anyone for the social issues 
addressed in the series premiere. 
A new platform might be just what 
Lopez needs to articulate his expe-
riences as a Latino sitcom star and 
comedian, but the first episode 
lacks the authenticity needed to 
do this. The most genuinely funny 
moment in the episode is when the 
principal at his daughter’s school 
asks, “Do you have anything with-
out your name on it?”

How do you solve a problem like Maria??

UMGASS ‘Pinafore’

By BAILEY KADIAN

Daily Arts Writer

This weekend, the University 

of Michigan Gilbert & Sullivan 
Society 
pres-

ents “HMS Pin-
afore.” This is 
one of the two 
shows the orga-
nization 
puts 

on each year, 
dedicating their 
productions to 
the operettas of 
Gilbert & Sul-
livan. The orga-
nization 
was 

founded in 1947 
and is the old-
est student-run 
organization performing Gilbert 
& Sullivan’s works nationwide. 
UMGASS is composed of under-
graduate and graduate students, as 
well as other community members 
in the Ann Arbor area.

“ ‘HMS Pinafore’ is, on the face 

of it, your love between ranks 
story,” UMGASS promoter and 
School of Music, Theatre & Dance 
freshman Natan Zamansky said. 
“A poor sailor falls in love with the 
captain’s daughter. The captain, 
however, would much rather she 
marry the Admiral.”

Despite this, Josephine, the cap-

tain’s daughter, decides to rebel 

against the established system of 
social order and pursue her love for 
Ralph Rackstraw, the poor sailor.

Opening at the Opera Comique 

in London in 1878, “HMS Pinafore” 
ran for 571 shows. This was Gilbert 
& Sullivan’s fourth operatic work 
together, earning immense praise 
both in Britain and internationally. 
Gilbert & Sullivan’s works have 
greatly influenced modern pieces 
of musical theater today.

The pair mix story and satire — 

which is one of the many reasons 
why their works have gained such 
a following.

“Gilbert & Sullivan wrote about 

things they observed in their social 
circle and in their lifetime and 
gently satirized political figures, 
societal conventions and class dis-
tinctions of their era,” Director 
David Andrews wrote in an e-mail 
interview. “Yet when you see the 
characters they present and the 
issues they address in ‘HMS Pin-
afore’ and in their other operas, 
everything and everyone will seem 
very familiar.”

This year, UMGASS has decided 

to take a new approach to the well-
known opera, to offer their regular 
audience members something new 
and different, as well as introduce 
first-time members to the works of 
Gilbert & Sullivan. 

“We’re setting ‘HMS Pinafore’ 

as if it is being presented by a war 

re-enactment group.” Andrews 
wrote. “Since the Pinafore is a ship, 
and a British ship, of course, I chose 
a naval engagement from British 
history — the Anglo-Zanzibar War 
of 1896.”

The opera is written with spe-

cific “type” characters, but there 
is freedom for the cast to add their 
own touch to established character 
qualities. Zamansky said the cast 
and production team are working 
together to shape these characters 
in new ways.

“With Gilbert & Sullivan, after 

their first shows, they were writ-
ing for a troupe. They wrote very 
specific character types,” Zaman-
sky said. “They are broadly painted 
though and it gives the actors a 
chance to shape them in their own 
ways.”

This piece offers something for 

long time followers of Gilbert & 
Sullivan and for those who aren’t 
familiar with their works. Andrews 
wrote that “HMS Pinafore” is 
layered with fun and UMGASS is 
thrilled to be able to share it with 
the Ann Arbor community.

“Art and Literature that has 

stood the test of time (and G&S 
opera is definitely included in 
that category) is a great resource 
for better understanding human 
nature,” he wrote. “Even at a dis-
tance (in the case of HMS Pin-
afore) of 138 years.”

Cerebral ‘Remember’

By JOE WAGNER

Daily Arts Writer

When dealing with topics as 

sensitive as the Holocaust, it 
seems necessary to write about 
them 
with 

the 
utmost 

care. Its grav-
ity necessitates 
exploration of 
serious themes 
and if not done 
in an appro-
priate 
man-

ner, it can be 
disastrous. In Benjamin August’s 
freshman screenplay “Remem-
ber,” he utilizes the Holocaust as a 
plot ploy to create a semi-psycho-
logical thriller. Directed by Atom 

Egoyan (“The Sweet Hereafter”), 
the movie’s rather vapid use of the 
Holocaust unsuccessfully tries 
to take on big themes. “Remem-
ber,” which features a superb 
performance from Christopher 
Plummer (“A Beautiful Mind”), is 
nonetheless an entertaining film 
if one is able to completely sus-
pend disbelief during its various 
ludicrous scenes.

Zev (Christopher Plummer) 

is a recent widow and sufferer 
of dementia living in an assisted 
living home outside of New York 
City. On the seventh day of sitting 
shiva for his wife, Zev is given a 
letter by his friend Max (Martin 
Landau “Ed Wood”) who also 
lives in the home. In the letter, 
Max writes says Zev and Max 

are the last two people on earth 
who are able to identify the man 
who killed their families at Aus-
chwitz. Because Max is physically 
disabled, Zev promises to go kill 
the man who killed their families. 
Max also writes that when this 
man immigrated to the United 
States he took the name of a sur-
vivor, Rudy Kulander, but his real 
name is Otto Wallisch.

We did find out that Max has 

apparently done his research. 
There are four Rudy Kulanders 
who emigrated from Germany at 
this time. Now, Zev must travel 
across the country to hunt down 
the right Rudy Kulander to avenge 
their families.

So a sick 88-year-old takes off 

on a cross-country roadtrip to get 
his revenge on a Nazi, but first 
he has to purchase a Glock so he 
can do his murdering. Ah yes, of 
course. It only makes sense that 
an elderly man with dementia 
is able to go to a gun store and 
purchase a firearm. This is not 
to mention the fact that Zev asks 
the vendor to write down the 
instructions of how to use the gun 
because “he forgets things some-
times.” Maybe, it’s a poignant 
comment on how unrestricted the 
purchase of a gun is in the United 
States, but it definitely feels more 
like bad writing.

Zev encounters his first Rudy, 

who happens to have at hand 
proof that he was a Nazi but 
served in Africa, and didn’t kill 
Zev’s family. This encounter 
serves to move the plot forward, 
but doesn’t develop the charac-
ter or explore the large themes it 
attempts to take on, including but 
not limited to: memory, history, 
revenge and family.

Plummer’s 
character 
has 

to consistently reread the let-
ter after every time he sleeps as 
his dementia causes him to for-
get where he is, what has hap-
pened and his mission. Although 
essential for the plot to make any 
sense, the rereading of the letter 
becomes repetitive and annoying. 
Plummer’s performance, partly 
through these repetitive actions, 
does make the character and the 
disease from which he suffers feel 
real and believable.

Eventually, Zev reaches the 

last Rudy Kulander. At this point, 
there is a large twist which the 
astute viewer may have seen com-
ing. This turn, although it may 
have been inevitable, is interest-
ing and thought provoking. And 
ironically it is what is most dis-
appointing about the film. Here, 
August sets up situation which 
offers the possibility for explor-
ative and philosophical discus-
sion through dialogue. Rather 
than take this challenge head on, 
he avoids it, taking the easy way 
out with his characters.

The movie is entertaining, but 

when a film takes on so much, we 
expect so much more than what 
“Remember” gives us.

In recognition of 
Slimane’s vision

Exit of legendary 
creative director 
marks new chapter 
for Saint Laurent

By ANAY KATYAL

Daily Arts Writer

It’s been an open secret for 

some time. But this past April 
Fools, in twistedly humorous 
fashion, Kering, owner of Saint 
Laurent (and a cachet of other 
labels ) finally confirmed that 
Hedi Slimane, the man credited 
for the signature aesthetic so 
synonymous with Saint Laurent 
today, is leaving his post as cre-
ative director of the label. In an 
industry where designer turn-
over has been a topic of critical 
discussion, Slimane’s exit isn’t 
the most welcome of news, but 
the legacy he leaves behind him 
at Saint Laurent is of great sig-
nificance.

Before 
Slimane 
took 
the 

helm, Stefano Pilati’s eight-
year stint as creative director 
of the label led to Saint Laurent 
being known for its concep-
tual, avant-garde focus toward 
collections. 
Oftentimes, 
it 

resulted in fascinating, eclectic 
pieces that went in a multitude 
of directions. Slimane all but 

stymied that approach in his 
four years with Saint Laurent, 
but where he lacked in a sense 
innovation, he more than made 
up in his adherence to cohe-
sion and consistency. It’s an 
approach the romantics of the 
fashion world may not enjoy, 
but the powerhouse that Saint 
Laurent has become can largely 
be attributed to Slimane’s own 
doing.

Slimane shook Saint Lau-

rent from the ground up when 
he first began his reign. Under 
his guidance, the look and busi-
ness of the label went through 
a creative consolidation in line 
with Slimane’s vision. A signa-
ture aesthetic was crafted for 
the label, backed by the pieces it 
produced and the label’s public 
persona so meticulously crafted 
by Slimane. He even moved to 
drop “Yves” from the label’s 
title in the process — a decision 
still widely criticized for how it 
axed the symbolic connection 
between the label and its very 
own founder.

In his bid for commercializa-

tion of the label, Slimane reap-
propriated a lot of what he saw 
being worn and embodied on 
the streets of Paris and New 
York’s clubs, creating a roman-
ticized version of modern urban 
street culture. With vintage 
biker jackets and shredded 

denim galore, Slimane’s Saint 
Laurent peddled an expensive 
homage to today’s urban youth, 
an approach that was met with 
its fair share of critics.

Despite the fashion world’s 

often tenuous relationship with 
Slimane, his unrequited love 
for indie rock and youth culture 
garnered audiences in droves. 
Under Slimane, Saint Laurent’s 
sales doubled. Retailers could 
barely keep up with the demand 
for Saint Laurent’s ready-to-
wear pieces. He often rehashed 
vintage designs, and his cre-
ative direction rarely deviated 
from the singular philosophy he 
employed, but people enjoyed 
the products that came out of it. 
Celebrities and customers alike 
sought excuses to publicly don 
his work whenever possible.

Slimane’s unwavering adher-

ence to his fashion ideology 
is largely what led to much of 
the success he enjoyed at the 
label. It’s unclear whether his 
successor, Anthony Vaccarello 
(announced Monday afternoon) 
will take the helm bearing Sli-
mane’s own flag or venture in 
a direction of his own, but the 
brand Saint Laurent is today 
is a brand with plenty of cul-
tural capital and staying power 
thanks to Slimane’s efforts. 
Vaccarello, undoubtedly, has 
fairly large shoes to fill.

The Michigan rowing team finished second-best out of four teams at the ACC/Big Ten Double Dual on Saturday.
Michigan falls to Virginia

Wolverines lose 
to fourth-ranked 
Cavaliers at four-

team meet

By KATIE CONKLIN 

Daily Sports Writer

The Michigan women’s rowing 

team traveled to Columbus over 
the weekend with one thing in 
mind — to beat No. 4 Virginia.

Though the seventh-ranked 

Wolverines had a solid showing 
overall at the ACC/Big Ten 
Double Dual, they were unable 
to pull ahead of the Cavaliers at 
Griggs Reservoir on Saturday.

The first varsity eight boat 

was closest to victory in the 
first morning session. The crew 
crossed the finish line at 6:26.2, 
just over three seconds slower 
than Virginia. The Cavaliers 
expanded the gap against the 
second varsity eight and the 
varsity fours, though they were 
still competitive.

Entering the second session 

of the day, Michigan was set 
for a comeback. Racing against 
Clemson and Michigan State — the 
Wolverines beat the latter team in 
September — they took charge.

Winning all varsity races, 

Michigan rowed through the 
Tigers 
and 
Spartans 
with 

ease. The first varsity eight, 
conducted by junior coxswain 

Francesca Derteano, redeemed 
itself with a 6:40.7 victory, 
more than five seconds faster 
than runner-up Michigan State, 
while the second varsity eight 
won by nearly 13 seconds.

Both the first and second 

varsity fours demolished their 
competition, pulling ahead of 
second place by 10 and 18.4 
seconds, respectively. Michigan 
State, the Wolverines’ lone Big 
Ten competition, trailed in third 
for both races.

Michigan will see more Big Ten 

competition this coming weekend 
against Ohio State and Rutgers 
when it travels to Camden, N.J. 
And with a few Big Ten wins 
under its belt, the team will enter 
the water confident.

Hutchins preaches confidence

By AVI SHOLKOFF 

Daily Sports Writer

There have been moments 

this season when Megan Betsa 
absolutely dominated opposing 
hitters. In one instance, against 
Western Michigan, the junior 
right-hander allowed only one hit 
in six innings. In another, facing 
Northwestern, she fanned 12 in 
five innings.

At other points, Betsa remains 

wild 
and 
inconsistent, 
most 

notably in her appearances from 
the bullpen. Coming on in relief at 
UCLA, Betsa walked four batters 
in two innings and nearly lost 
Michigan’s lead. Most notably, 
in the Wolverines’ disappointing 
loss in the first game of the 
Northwestern series, she pitched 
to four batters, walking three and 
hitting one to earn her second loss 
on the season.

An important part of this stark 

difference in performances stems 
from Betsa’s lack of confidence, 
according to Michigan coach Carol 
Hutchins. Throughout her 32-year 
career coaching the Wolverines, 
she has pointed to confidence as 
the most significant factor to a 
player’s success. Hutchins instills 
this in her players by teaching them 
to focus on their preparation and to 
believe in their daily workouts.

“A player who plays with 

confidence is twice the player 
who’s playing with no confidence,” 
Hutchins 
said. 
“Confidence 

means you aren’t afraid of failing, 

you’re confident that what you do 
can work. You’re not afraid that it 
won’t work.”

Betsa 
understands 
the 

importance of relaxing and simply 
focusing on one batter at a time. If 
she loses composure in a game, 
her fellow players go to the circle 
and simply tell her to calm down 
and offer their support.

“Last year really proved that 

for me, when I 
was confident, 
I threw way 
better,” Betsa 
said. “I’m good 
enough to beat 
anyone in the 
country, 
and 

when I believe 
that, I’m really 
good.”

Michigan’s 

disastrous loss to Northwestern 
is a prime example of what occurs 
when it loses its confidence. The 
Wolverines, who led by six runs 
at one point, coughed up their 
advantage, and despite a sudden 
awakening late in the game, the 
rally ultimately proved futile.

“It occurred to us that we might 

not win, so our lineup stopped 
scoring,” Hutchins said. “Then 
in the seventh, they were afraid 
of losing, and then (the players) 
played to win.”

Thus, for Michigan to continue 

its recent string of victories 
and high-powered offense, it is 
imperative for the top-ranked 
Wolverines to maintain high poise 

both with a lead and a deficit.

Two players stand out as 

showing 
high 
determination. 

Hutchins believes that fifth-year 
senior right-hander Sara Driesenga 
exuded tremendous confidence 
during a tournament in Fullerton, 
Calif., last month. She pitched 13 
shutout innings and garnered two 
wins in that weekend.

Throughout 
the 
season, 

senior 
second 

baseman Sierra 
Romero 
has 

demonstrated 
this 
same 

tenacity on both 
offense 
and 

defense.

“You 
can 

watch Romero 
play, and you 
really have to 

look hard to see her lose a minute 
of her confidence,” Hutchins 
said. “It’s really a rare occasion. 
She’s fearless.”

Even when she strikes out, she 

maintains this belief in herself, 
which makes her even tougher.

Romero’s fellow players support 

their coach’s claims of her constant 
dedication and determination.

“Knowing that Romo ahead of 

me is going to get on, or (senior 
right-fielder 
Kelsey 
Susalla) 

behind me, takes the pressure 
off,” said junior left-fielder Kelly 
Christner. “(Knowing this) helps 
(me) relax up there.”

Offensively, 
Hutchins 
can 

determine a player’s mindset from 

her first swings by seeing if the 
batter is pondering her decisions 
at the plate. Because Hutchins 
knows her players so well, she 
can sense from the dugout if one 
of them is having a bad day. She 
urges her players to simply focus 
on their strengths rather than 
dwell on their weaknesses.

Betsa looks to shortstop Abby 

Ramirez for a boost, as the junior 
demonstrates 
consistency 
and 

a helpful smile. To have such a 
person behind her in the infield is 
essential for a pitcher who, as she 
has shown this season, can perform 
to an All-American level but also 
show shades of inconsistency.

Christner demonstrates that 

Hutchins’ players heed the lessons 
of their coach. She even adds her 
own interpretation of confidence.

“I think the main thing is being 

mentally tough,” Christner said. 
“I know that I am a great player 
and I know that I can go up there 
and hit the ball. If I am not right 
in my head, then I’m not going to 
do well. I think just setting aside 
everything else, going back to 
the basics, clearing your mind, 
because it takes the pressures 
situations and tones them down 
into a regular at-bat.”

As much as Hutchins would 

like for every individual on 
her team to constantly show 
confidence, her players sometimes 
let the pressure get to them.

The Wolverines’ job is to limit 

those moments to the best of their 
ability. 

BASEBALL
Wolverines dig 
early hole, snap 
winning streak

By NATHANIEL CLARK 

Daily Sports Writer

The No. 17 Michigan baseball 

team entered South Bend, Ind., 
having won its last nine games 
and 13 of its 
last 15.

All 
of 

that came to an end Tuesday 
night as the Wolverines (12-6) 
fell to Notre Dame, 9-5. The nine 
runs that Michigan surrendered 
tied for the most it has given up in 
a single game this season.

“We weren’t keeping a tally,” 

said Michigan coach Erik Bakich 
of his team’s winning streak. “As 
much as we want to win every 
single game, nobody does that at 
any level.”

The Fighting 

Irish attack on 
the Wolverines 
began in the 
second inning 
when 
Notre 

Dame 
(16-11) 

put runners on 
first and second 
with 
no 
one 

out. Michigan’s 
starting pitcher, freshman right-
hander Will Tribucher, hit the 
next batter to load the bases for 
the Fighting Irish.

Following the play, Notre Dame 

catcher Ryan Lidge hit a two-run 
double to put the Fighting Irish 
up, 2-0. Bakich had seen enough 
and proceeded to pull Tribucher 
in favor of freshman right-hander 
Troy Miller.

“I can’t wait to see (Tribucher) 

again this weekend,” Bakich said. 
“Because I know he is going to 
do great. Tonight just wasn’t his 
night, and I told him that on the 
mound. He’s going to get right 
back on the horse this weekend.”

But the first batter Miller 

faced, Fighting Irish centerfielder 
Kyle Richardson, blasted his own 
two-run double to widen the gap 
to four. An RBI double by first 
baseman Zak Kutsulis later in the 
frame extended Notre Dame’s 
advantage to five.

Miller 
escaped 
the 
third 

inning 
without 
any 
further 

damage, 
but 
Fighting 
Irish 

designated hitter Jake Shepski 
launched a two-run home run in 
the bottom of the fourth to make 
the score 7-0. Left fielder Ricky 

Hernandez hit an RBI single to 
left field later in the inning to put 
Michigan down 8-0.

Michael Herne stymied the 

Wolverines’ offense as he pitched 
seven innings and allowed just 
three hits. He surrendered only 
one run, which came in the 
form of a home run by freshman 
shortstop Michael Brdar, making 
the score 9-1.

“It was just one of those nights 

where we got behind early,” 
Bakich said. “We got behind with 
two big innings that they scored 
in — the second and the fourth — 
and that was really it. It’s just one 
of those nights.”

But Michigan found new life 

in the eighth inning when it 

put 
runners 

on first and

the 
comeback 
effort 

fell short as Brdar struck out 
swinging and the Wolverines 
went down 1-2-3 in the ninth.

“Our guys certainly showed 

some grit and some resiliency like 
they have many times,” Bakich 
said. “Unfortunately, we just dug 
ourselves too big of a hole early in 
the game to get out of it.”

Michigan will have little time 

to lick its wounds, though, as the 
Wolverines are slated to return 
home to take on Bowling Green 
on Wednesday before beginning 
a three-game set with Minnesota 
on Friday.

“The good thing about baseball 

is that sometimes you get an 
opportunity the very next day (to 
recover from a loss),” Bakich said. 
“And that’s the case for us. We 
have something to look forward 
to tomorrow.”

Flaherty deserves the NCAA Tournament
I

t was March 3 in the 
press conference room at 
Bankers Life Fieldhouse in 

Indianapolis, 
and Katelynn 
Flaherty took 
the stand. 
The Michigan 
women’s 
basketball 
team had 
just lost its 
opening game 
of the Big Ten 
Tournament, 
ending its 
hopes of making the NCAA 
Tournament.

Clearly frustrated, Flaherty 

sat at the podium. The team shot 
45 percent that day, and perhaps 
more solo attempts from 
Flaherty may have helped.

“Katelynn, was there a point 

where you just said, ‘I have got 
to start shooting it more?’ ” 
asked one reporter.

Flaherty answered humbly, as 

usual, remarking more about the 
flow of the game and playing for 
her teammates than about the 
fact that she’s the team’s best 
scorer. Her response veiled a 
sense of disappointment. 

Before the loss, Michigan 

was 9-9 in the conference and 
18-12 overall. Not the strongest 
case for a NCAA Tournament 
bid, but strong enough that a 
solid showing at the conference 
tournament could have put them 
on the bubble.

The Wolverines led Iowa 

by 16 points at one point, but 
the Hawkeyes fought back to 
win. Flaherty put up 31 and 
broke Michigan’s single-season 
scoring record, but any positive 
notes were overshadowed by 
the loss.

Now, a month later, Flaherty 

has received Honorable Mention 
All-American recognition, but 
she’s neither a Big Ten champion 
nor had the opportunity to play 
in the NCAA Tournament.

The latter is the most 

disappointing, because it’s hard to 
picture an athlete as talented as 
Flaherty not playing in the NCAA 
Tournament. Seven months ago, 
she claimed her desire to help 
bring the team to the next level, 
a goal that involved making the 
64-team field.

That was at the team media 

day in October, where much of 
the focus was on Flaherty.

Flaherty was just days away 

from the tip off of her second 
year as a Wolverine, and 
expectations were high. She 
followed her record-breaking 
freshman season with a Team 
USA tryout over the summer, 
but had missed the cut on the 
12-person roster.

Among other things, her 

teammates discussed their own 

expectations for Katelynn, what 
it’s like to play alongside her, the 
ins and outs of her game as well 
as what she’s like off the court.

The general vibe her 

teammates gave off was that 
they all knew Flaherty was the 
team’s strongest player, but they 
also knew she would deflect the 
admiration. And just as much 
as she was humble, she was 
five times more driven. One 
teammate said that Flaherty’s 
biggest strength wasn’t her 
3-point shooting or her ball-
handling skills, but “her ability 
to do whatever it takes.”

Talking to her teammates, 

examining her biography and 
statistics and listening to Barnes 
Arico’s appraisals, it becomes 
clear that she is already one of 

the best players — if not the best 
— the program has ever seen.

At media day, Flaherty 

explained what she had taken 
away from the Team USA tryout, 
what parts of her game she’d 
worked on most in the offseason 
and, briefly, what her personal 
and team goals looked like.

She wanted to be a first-team 

All-Big Ten selection and an 
All-American. For the team, she 
wanted Michigan to win the 
Big Ten and make the NCAA 
Tournament.

Over the course of the season, 

she made her case for each 
individual accolade, but the 
team couldn’t sway the NCAA 
Tournament committee after 
falling short its effort to pick 
up big wins. Flaherty rarely 

faltered, scoring more than 
15 points in all but three of 
Michigan’s 28 regular season 
games. She put up 22.3 points 
per game and remained one of 
the nation’s top-10 scorers all 
season, checking off another one 
of her goals with a first-team 
All-Big Ten selection.

She continued to amaze 

fans every time she hit a deep 
3 or wove through opponents’ 
defenses. She made basketball 
look easy and headlines repetitive.

Each week, Flaherty 

scored in bunches against 
NCAA Tournament teams 
like Maryland, Ohio State 
and Michigan State. Against 
reputable, quality opponents, 
Flaherty powered one of 
the nation’s highest-scoring 

offenses. When mid-March 
rolled around, though, Michigan 
was left for the Women’s 
National Invitation Tournament, 
the second-rate bracket behind 
the Big Dance.

She lit up the WNIT during 

a semifinal run for the second 
straight year, but it was all 
just consolation. Michigan 
was hoping to make the NCAA 
Tournament in both seasons, 
and it feels like Flaherty has 
been missing out.

A player of Flaherty’s caliber 

deserves to compete on the 
national stage, Her postseason 
résumé shouldn’t list the WNIT. 
It should list the real thing. She 
doesn’t have the same talent 
around her like some of the 
aforementioned teams, and at 
times it feels like she carries the 
Wolverines, but those days may 
be over.

It’s important to note that 

Michigan is the right fit. 
Flaherty and Barnes Arico have 
known each other for years — a 
relationship that began when 
Flaherty was in middle school. 
She excels in the ‘2’ spot in 
Michigan’s guard-heavy system, 
and overall the Wolverines are 
improving. Each recruiting class 
continues to be better than the 
previous one, and potentially 
leading Michigan to the national 
spotlight would be indicative of 
her success.

An appearance would not 

only signify the Wolverines’ 
rising program, but also 
highlight what will inevitably 
be one of the greatest careers 
in the history of Michigan 
women’s basketball.

Halfway done with her 

college career, Flaherty 
hasn’t played in the NCAA 
Tournament. If she doesn’t 
before graduating, it would be 
severely disappointing.

Five Things We Learned: Spring Camp

Speight, O’Korn 

even in quarterback 
competition; wide 
receiver corps ailing

By JAKE LOURIM 

Managing Sports Editor

Jim Harbaugh’s second spring 

camp at Michigan was, as is 
seemingly everything else he 
does, eventful.

It started over the University’s 

Spring Break in Florida, where 
Harbaugh drew criticism from 
other coaches and administrators 
around the country. It continued 
on Twitter, where Harbaugh 
countered that criticism in the 
form of jabs at Ohio State Athletic 
Director Gene Smith and others. 
And it wrapped up Friday under 
the lights with the Spring Game, 
where the Wolverines gave fans 
their final taste of action until 
the fall.

Overall, Michigan seems to be 

improved from last year’s 10-3 
team at most positions. It still has 
a few holes to fill, but some could 
be helped by the rest of the top-
ranked recruiting class coming 
in this summer. And it still has 
a few positions to settle — most 
notably at quarterback — but, for 
right now, the talent appears to 
be there one way or another.

The experience is there as 

well. The Wolverines could start 
as many as 10 fifth-year seniors, 
depending on how the last few 
spots shake out, with many more 
fourth-year players in the mix, 
too. So, Michigan has finished 
up the spring where it hoped to 
be at the end of last season — 
with a legitimate chance to be 
in position for a Big Ten title if 
it keeps on its current trajectory 
throughout the rest of the year.

Here are five things we learned 

from the team’s spring camp:

1. The quarterback 

competition is just that.

Anyone 
who 
expected 

transfer John O’Korn to win 
the starting job going away is 

mistaken. O’Korn is by far the 
most experienced after starting 
for a year and a half at Houston 
in 2013 and 2014. He earned rave 
reviews from coaches for his 
performance on the scout team 
last season and, in the minds of 
many, headed into 2016 as the 
presumptive frontrunner for the 
starting spot.

But redshirt sophomore Wilton 

Speight had something to say 
about that. Speight, whose shining 
moment at present is last season’s 
game-winning touchdown pass in 
spot duty at Minnesota, was the 
first player under center during 
open practice March 26 at Ford 
Field. Then, he came out on top 
in the Spring Game on Friday — 
albeit by one point.

Speight (5-for-6, 46 yards, two 

total touchdowns in the Spring 
Game) and O’Korn (6-for-14, 
93 yards, one total touchdown) 
have both had mixed results 
this spring. O’Korn is the more 
prolific runner, but Speight is 
likely the more consistent passer.

Redshirt 
junior 
Shane 

Morris is third on the depth 
chart for now, and freshman 
Brandon Peters is talented but 
inexperienced 
and 
unproven. 

But all of the quarterbacks have 
five months to make a move. 
Harbaugh and his staff have 
not named a clear leader at the 
position, or even said when they 
would like to do so. The starter 
could very well not be apparent 
until he takes the field Sept. 3. 
Until then, buckle up for another 
fierce competition.

2. Expectations are as high 
as ever, and Michigan isn’t 

shying away from them.

The defensive line thinks it 

can be the best in the country. 
The secondary thinks it can 
be the best in the country. The 
team thinks it can be the best in 
the country.

Three 
months 
after 
the 

Wolverines 
shocked 
most 

people with a 10-3 season, no 

one is short on optimism in 
Ann Arbor. Multiple players 
have already referenced the 
Sept. 3 season opener against 
Hawaii at Michigan Stadium. 
While Michigan ended up being 
successful last season, this spring 
has generated more excitement 
than most others in recent years.

Most of that comes from the 

defense, which dominated for 
most of last season. It returns 
six starters this year and has a 
capable replacement ready to step 
in at every open position. Redshirt 
sophomore Jabrill Peppers has 
proven his versatility, even stepping 
in at strong-side linebacker for 
most of the spring. If he stays at 
linebacker, the secondary will 
consist entirely of fourth- or fifth-
year players, and the defensive line 
is deeper than ever.

3. The offense could use some 

help on the outside.

All of Michigan’s quarterbacks 

had their moments in the Spring 

Game, but they need some more 
receivers to throw to. Most of the 
Wolverines’ injuries have been 
out wide. Fifth-year senior Jehu 
Chesson remains out, redshirt 
sophomore 
Freddy 
Canteen 

is no longer on the roster and 
redshirt 
sophomore 
Maurice 

Ways — who impressed for most 
of the spring — underwent foot 
surgery last week.

That 
doesn’t 
leave 
much 

help on the flanks: Redshirt 
junior Jack Wangler, redshirt 
sophomore Drake Harris and 
sophomore Grant Perry were 
the only wide receivers to catch 
a pass in the Spring Game. Fifth-
year senior Amara Darboh was 
held out for most of the game to 
give the others a chance, but the 
Wolverines will need more than 
just him to be healthy and ready 
to contribute in the fall.

4. The offensive line has 
continued to improve.

For the third straight year, 

Michigan returns more than it 
loses on the offensive line. In 
2013 and 2014, the Wolverines 
took their lumps up front in 
preparation for a season like this 
— when they will start three fifth-
year seniors in left guard Erik 
Magnuson, right guard Kyle Kalis 
and right tackle Ben Braden.

Graham Glasgow, a possible 

NFL Draft pick, left a hole at 
center when he exhausted his 
eligibility last season. He was 
the Wolverines’ best offensive 
lineman last season, but former 
left tackle Mason Cole appears to 
have shifted over to fill his spot 
permanently. Sophomore Grant 
Newsome will step into Cole’s 
old spot, and Michigan expects 
to keep its rhythm.

If the experience in the trenches 

finally pays off, the Wolverines’ 
offense could look smoother than 
it has in recent years.

5. Bold Prediction: Ty Isaac 
will take the first snap of the 
2016 season at running back.

Early 
in 
spring 
camp, 

Isaac felt positive about his 
improvement since a difficult 
2015 season. He dropped weight, 
added speed and prepared to 
shoulder some of the workload 
in Michigan’s backfield. Then, 
others such as Harbaugh and 
Kalis echoed Isaac’s thoughts, 
praising him for being hungrier 
this spring. Finally, Isaac put 
his improvement on display, 
carrying 10 times for 78 yards in 
the Spring Game.

Meanwhile, senior running 

back De’Veon Smith, the leader 
of the group coming into camp 
after a productive 2015, has been 
hurt on and off and did not touch 
the ball in the Spring Game. He 
said after the game that he’s 
merely resting to return to full 
strength for the season and, if 
he’s healthy, should still enter 
fall camp as the lead back.

But if there was any doubt last 

season, Isaac proved this spring 
that he’s not going away quietly. 
His emergence gives Michigan 
another option in the backfield if 
Smith is injured or if it just wants 
a change of pace.

THE MICHIGAN DAILY | APRIL 6, 2016


T

his is my last column of the semester and pos-
sibly my last column ever. There are so many 
topics from my upbringing and culture that I 

have yet to tackle, but I don’t know if I want to do that 
in writing.

You see, for the past year and a half I’ve been writ-

ing continuously about a variety of issues from my 
upbringing that attempt to be both comical and seri-
ous, fluff and honest. By allotting 500 words every two 
weeks just to exploring my identity, I’ve attempted to 
discover something — anything — about myself, who I 
want to be in the future and where I see my place as a 
person of South Asian origin.

And I haven’t reached a definite conclusion on any 

of those things. I don’t know very much about myself, 
and I definitely don’t know where my South Asian 
identity fits into my life.

That’s not to say that I’m conflicted about being an 

Indian and a Hindu/Jain — not at all. I am Indian and 
I am both Hindu and Jain, which is a part of me that 
will never change. But rather, I don’t know how big of 
a part my Indian origin plays into my life.

It takes so many forms.
It’s in the food that my mom packs for me every 

weekend. It’s in the music I listen to when I’m writing 
an essay in English.

And it’s in my blood.
But there are also parts of me that don’t have any-

thing to do with my ethnic and religious roots. These 
parts of my personality — uninfluenced by my culture 
— are what I always considered to be my “authentic” 
self. I know I am more than just my skin color and 
country of origin.

Identities are complex. They’re uncharted territo-

ries, and they often remain undiscovered. They come 
in so many different forms that it becomes difficult to 
pinpoint an intersection of all of them. Identity is a 
vast and crowded Venn diagram. Mine more resembles 
thick, dark scribbles than a cohesive display of differ-
ent facets from my personality.

It’s been impossible for me to reconcile my differ-

ent identities and give myself a singular label that 
describes everything about who I am as a person and 
what I stand for.

Through this column, I’ve been privileged enough 

to have gained a sliver of understanding about where 
my South Asian identity seeps into my life, but there 
are so many issues I have yet to tackle that I’m not sure 
I want to take on in a public writing forum.

Issues of the privilege I have as a South Asian woman 

of Indian origin and of a Hindu religious background.

Why I consider myself as having a religion, but avoid 

going to the temple.

Why I can be outspoken about my Indian culture 

hidden behind a veil of bits and pixels on your com-
puter screen, but can’t do the same in real life.

These are topics that I’ve wanted to write about for 

a long time. For most of my columns, I would begin 
to write a few sentences about them and then just as 
quickly erase them in favor of something that would 
require less introspection and digging.

As much as I’ve been open about being South Asian, 

I’ve also been a coward.

W

hen your older siblings are a little more than 
a year apart from you, it is natural to ques-
tion what motivated your conception. When I 

asked my parents why they had a third child, I expected 
a customary, sentimental answer. Something like, “We 
loved the twins so much we wanted a third child.” Some 
shit like that. I wasn’t expecting them to say they 
tried for a boy and having failed, stopped trying 
to have more children. As the third daughter of 
a former weightlifter, I’ve felt my sex has always 
been a bit of a disappointment. My parents want-
ed a Jack. They got a Jacqueline.

My father sells weightlifting equipment as 

one facet of his multi-platform company, which 
also includes sports science and journalism. We, 
along with my sisters and occasionally my moth-
er, travel internationally often to competitions 
where he gathers data for his articles and books. 
Every once in a while he’ll write a scathing edito-
rial about the girth of women’s weightlifting bars 
or the steroid use that rocks the small, eclectic 
world his writing caters to. Much of my child-
hood was spent at competitions, or playing Game 
Boy in his truck while he used a forklift to load it 
with platform mats.

This semester I wrote about my relationship 

with my father for an essay course. I didn’t real-
ize then how much my gender role would factor 
into our story.

For my sisters and I, appearing distinctly femi-

nine was not a concern in our youth. I was more 
rough and tumble than my siblings. I played in 
the dirt. I climbed trees with apples in the pock-
ets of my overalls. I grew up as Huckleberry 
Finn, not Mary Jane Wilks. I thought my dad 
liked me better that way.

When my father wanted help loading barbells 

into his truck, he would roll up his sleeves and 
say, “Let’s get to work, men.” I’ve always been more com-
fortable being called “dude” or “man” than “honey” or 
“sweetheart.” I wanted to be just like my dad, but felt my 
sex became a barrier between the two of us.

In high school my father wrestled and played baseball. 

He was into weightlifting too. I was an editor for my 

high school’s literary magazine and wore a lot of black. 
I ran track but was so terrible he once wore a paper bag 
on his head during one of my meets. I quit the team and 
took a drama class instead. I couldn’t keep up with what 
I believed would help our relationship — I couldn’t be the 
child he wanted.

My sister started weightlifting in high school, and the 

family dynamics shifted. She became the “athlete,” and 
our sister and I became chopped liver. She was closer to 
him than I ever could be. When we traveled to compe-
titions, he would be back in the training hall with her, 
and I’d be stuck behind a video camera flipping through 

a Cosmo and feeling utterly invisible. When his last book 
came out, some of the photos I’d taken made it in, but 
he falsely credited my sister. He probably mixed up our 
names — easily done, as they all rhyme — but it burned 
me in the worst way.

I don’t remember exactly when I realized my dad 

didn’t care about my sex, but I think it was 
around the time I discovered writing. I dabbled 
in high school, but in community college I was 
the editor in chief of our paper. He thought it 
was ridiculous and small-town, and mocked the 
articles I wrote and edited. But he always read 
them.

When I became a senior news editor at The 

Michigan Daily, he really started to pay atten-
tion. The night he called me a real journalist 
sticks out in my mind. My father was negotiat-
ing credentials for a weightlifting competition 
in Texas, and customarily we would attend with 
matching press passes that had to be applied for 
months in advance. Security was tight at this 
event, but my dad had confidence that if I was 
affiliated with the Daily I would get clearance.

“Now that you work for a real paper, they’ll let 

you back there,” he said, referring to the roped 
off area near the stage where a forest of pho-
tographers and videographers stood. There was 
confidence in his voice, and a flicker, however 
faint, of admiration. I never considered him hav-
ing that perspective. Squatting behind a tripod, 
Jackie the journalist. That’s how he saw me.

Writing had always been an important part of 

my life and at times my sole source of pride. My 
best grades were in English classes. The ever-
present word scrawled on my report cards was 
potential, shortly followed by talks too much. 
For my dad to see that potential in the thing that 
I loved was far more important than if I was the 

athlete he wanted, or the son he’d hoped for.

I never went to the competition, but I found an unlike-

ly link to my father in writing. My father just wanted 
something in common with his children, and he’s fond of 
us in his own way. I realized I didn’t have to be his son to 
be what he wanted. I just had to be his kid.

About a month ago, my friend Derek 

stopped by my apartment for the first time in 
our more than three-year relationship. I had 
slept on the tiny couch in Derek’s Ann Arbor 
living room several times, yet last month was 
the first time he had ever seen my front door. 
I gave him a quick tour of my apartment and 
then took him on a walk through the city.

Derek studied the beautifully restored 

historical buildings and the diverse groups 
of people milling about the streets near the 
railroad tracks. Neatly displayed business 
fronts greeted us with cheery windows and 
welcoming signs.

“I didn’t realize Ypsi was so big,” he said 

as we passed Depot Town, heading south on 
River Street toward Michigan Avenue.

I launched into the story of Ypsilanti’s two 

main commercial districts, separated by the 
Huron River, as we came closer to Michigan 
Ave.

“Depot Town is definitely the more hipstery 

district,” I said, pointing out how nearly every 
building is occupied by a local business. 
“There’s a lot of unique business models that 
cater to the local clientele. But it also seems a 

little more white and gentrified than the rest 
of the city.”

While many local businesses, City Hall and 

the Ypsilanti library call Michigan Avenue 
their home, Derek immediately detected the 
difference between the two downtowns. 
There are vacant buildings, an empty field and 
several franchised businesses, all of which are 
absent in Depot Town. 

We finished our tour, passing the notorious 

adult entertainment club Deja Vu, and headed 
back to my apartment near Depot Town.

“So, that’s basically it,” I concluded. 

“Obviously, there are residential areas and 
businesses located on the outskirts of the city, 
but we pretty much saw everything within 
walking distance.”

Heading toward his car, Derek replied, 

“Ypsi seems pretty cool.”

In the almost three years that I have lived 

here, only a handful of my Ann Arbor friends 
have witnessed Ypsilanti as I see it every day. 
There are many reasons: Ann Arbor is a bigger 
city that has a lot to offer; you have to commute 
to Ypsilanti and traffic is nearly always a 
hassle; I already spend a lot of my time in Ann 

Arbor with work and school; everybody else 
lives in Ann Arbor.

But sometimes I wonder if it’s the perception 

of Ann Arbor as better than Ypsilanti that 
deters my friends from visiting.

University students in Ypsilanti

According to University spokesman Rick 

Fitzgerald, 599 students currently list an 
Ypsilanti zip code as either their permanent or 
local address. Of those nearly 600 addresses, 
only 196 are undergraduate students. For 
many, cost is a motivating factor for the move 
to Ypsilanti.

One of those students is Chris James, an 

LSA senior and the Mass Communications 
chair for the Black Student Union. James 
lived in Ypsilanti for two years during his 
undergraduate career. Motivated by the 
affordable housing options, he felt comfortable 
moving to Ypsilanti after spending his first 
two years in the dorms.

“I had no perceptions,” James wrote in an 

e-mail interview about his feelings prior to 
the move. “I figured it was a regular city with 
more people who look like me.”

James, a Black student from Flint, wrote 

that he was not worried about the negative 
stereotypes that often depict Ypsilanti as “the 
hood” or “the ghetto.”

“It was nowhere near what I had come from 

and, in fact, it was a very nice place to stay,” 
James continued. “I actually enjoyed staying 
out there more than I enjoyed living on (the 
University’s) campus at times.”

LSA junior Hannah Klemkow also lived in 

Ypsilanti last summer while commuting to 
Ann Arbor for work. Klemkow, a Flint native 
as well, enjoyed the four brief months she 
spent in the city. Similar to James, she missed 
the city after returning to Ann Arbor.

“After I moved back to Ann Arbor, I actually 

missed living in Ypsi often,” Klemkow wrote 
in an e-mail interview. “It is smaller so there is 
a bit of a small town comfort in the downtown 
area. I also kind of missed being able to be 
a part of both the Ann Arbor and the Ypsi 
community (sic).”

Miranda Ojeda, a 2015 alum, lived in 

Ypsilanti during her junior year of college. 
She echoed the nostalgia for Ypsilanti after 
moving away from the city.

“When I moved back to campus my senior 

year, I would always say I missed living in 
Ypsilanti and wish I would’ve stayed another 
year,” Ojeda said. “But everyone was against 
living off campus and in Ypsi.”

Celina Flegal, a 2015 LSA alum, lived in 

Ypsilanti during all four years of college 
with her now-husband who attended Eastern 
Michigan University. Before moving there, 
Flegal had only visited Ypsilanti a couple 
times. The first time she drove down Huron 
River Drive — a road that passes Interstate 
94 and runs parallel to the railroad tracks — 
Flegal wrote in an email interview that she 
thought to herself, “This looks pretty run-
down.”

But after passing into the residential area 

behind EMU and witnessing more of the 
city, Flegal was struck by the beauty of the 
landscape.

“After living there for four years, I still 

think Ypsilanti is a great city,” she wrote. “It 
has its problems like any other, but there are 
really beautiful parts of it that make it a great 
place to live, especially if you are a student.”

However, though there are less than 

ten miles between the two cities, many of 
the University student also mentioned the 
struggles of commuting from Ypsilanti.

“The biggest challenge was without a 

doubt the traffic, which was a lot worse than 
I expected,” wrote Alejandro Zuniga Sacks, 
a 2015 LSA alum and former Michigan Daily 
sports editor, who lived in Ypsilanti for almost 
a year after graduating.

“Finding a parking spot in Ann Arbor has 

become one of the most challenging things 
ever,” James confirmed. “I’m not sure why 
the city insists on such lack of parking near 
the University but that was another game that 
needed to be played.”

Flegal noted the commute often created 

problems in social situations:

“I also didn’t have the luxury of just inviting 

my friends over to hang out or study together,” 
she wrote. “They never really wanted to take 
the hour bus ride to my apartment, so most 
of the time I would have to plan to see them 
while I was on campus.”

Ojeda agreed that maintaining friendships 

required more work while living in Ypsilanti.

“Since all my friends lived in Ann Arbor, I 

would always have to drive to see them,” she 
said.

A Historical City

Crookedly winding down the southeastern 

portion of Michigan’s lower peninsula, the 
Huron River irrevocably altered the trajectory 
of human populations in the state. In the 18th 
century, Native Americans established a trail 
that crossed the river in the area that is now 
Ypsilanti. The intersecting area between the 
trail and river was used as a camping ground, 
a burial site and a trading post by several 
different tribes.

When Europeans finally made their way to 

Michigan, they immediately took advantage of 
the Huron River and existing Native American 
trails. In 1809, three French explorers became 
the first white settlers in Washtenaw County 
after building a trading post, known as 
“Godfroy’s on the Pottawatomi Trail,” on the 
river’s west bank. Less than two decades later, 
early frontiersman Major Benjamin Woodruff 
and a handful of his companions founded the 
first village, Woodruff’s Grove, in Washtenaw 

County.

By 1825, three prominent settlers — Judge 

Augustus Woodward, John Stewart and 
William Harwood — combined their land to 
create a town near where a federally planned 
road from Detroit to Chicago was set to cross 
the Huron River. Woodward suggested they 
name the new settlement “Ypsilanti” after 
the heroic Demetrius Ypsilanti, an early 
19th century field general in the Greek army. 
The remaining residents of Woodruff’s 
Grove eventually abandoned their original 
settlement, moving about a mile north to the 
prospering Ypsilanti. 

10 years later, Chicago Road (now known 

as Michigan Ave) was completed, propelling 
the creation of new settlements like Ypsilanti 
along its route. In 1838, a railroad expanding 
west from Detroit reached Ypsilanti, further 
contributing to the influx of people in the area. 
After two decades, a brick masonry station 
replaced the original wood-frame railroad 
depot on the east side of Huron River.

With accessible transportation and the 

initial inklings of industry, Depot Town 
became the first commercial district in 
Ypsilanti. Soon after, a second commercial 
district emerged on the west side of the 
river along the newly opened Chicago Road. 
Several mills were constructed during the last 
few decades of the 18th century with many 
used for manufacturing goods such as “The 
Union Suit” and the tightly-knit “Ypsilanti 
Underwear.”

In its initial phase, the Ypsilanti government 

stressed 
the 
importance 
of 
education. 

Twenty years after the city’s formation, its 
first seminary school was established. The 
Michigan State Normal School, a teacher-

preparatory school, was created a mere four 
years later, becoming the first normal school 
in the United States outside of the original 13 
colonies. In 1899, the normal school located 
in Ypsilanti became the first school to offer a 
four-year curriculum in teacher training. The 
school was then renamed the Michigan State 
Normal College.

In 1959, the college was once again renamed, 

officially 
becoming 
Eastern 
Michigan 

University. Enrollment at EMU peaked in the 
1990s with over 25,000 students. Currently, 
the school is governed by an eight-member 
Board of Regents which are appointed for 
eight-year terms by the governor of Michigan. 
As a public university, EMU is not required to 
pay land taxes to Ypsilanti’s city government.

As industrialization increased nationwide, 

Ypsilanti’s economy also expanded. In 1941, 
Ford Motor Company built an automotive 
plant in Ypsilanti Charter Township’s Willow 
Run neighborhood. The plant was rapidly 
converted to an assembly line for B-24 bombers 
when the United States entered World War 
II. About 100,000 employees worked at the 
Willow Run Bomber Plant, producing a B-24 
bomber every 55 minutes.

After the end of the war, the Willow Run 

Bomber Plant was bought by the independent 
automaker 
company 
Kaiser-Frazer 
and 

converted back to an automotive plant. In 
1953, General Motors purchased the plant 
for the production of engine transmissions. 
During the 1970s, the GM plant employed 
some 14,000 people.

In part due to the presence of automotive 

and 
manufacturing 
businesses, 
Ypsilanti 

gained thousands of new residents. The 
Great Migration — the movement of 6 million 

Black families from the South to urban areas 
throughout the nation which occurred in 
waves over 60 years — helped fill many 
industrial jobs and contributed to Ypsilanti’s 
growing population.

Other impoverished populations, including 

European immigrants and white families in 
the rural South, also moved to places such as 
Ypsilanti in search of a better life. Rose Will 
Monroe — one of the women who appeared in 
wartime propaganda videos and was closely 
associated with the iconic “Rosie the Riveter” 
— escaped rural poverty in the South through 
employment at the city’s Willow Run plant 
during World War II.

The influx of people to Ypsilanti continued 

until it reached its highest population in the 
1970 census: 29,538 residents.

However, the construction of interstate 

roads and the initial decline of industry had 
already begun to change the city’s trajectory. 
In 1941, the Willow Run Expressway was built 
near Ypsilanti and Belleville, becoming the first 
section of I-94 to be constructed in Michigan. 
By 1960, road workers had completed the 
construction of I-94 in Michigan. Before the 
interstate, cars were required to use Michigan 
Avenue — the old Chicago Road — and travel 
through downtown Ypsilanti when going east 
or west in southern Michigan. Now, they could 
skip the town entirely due to the interstate 
construction of the expressway.

For decades after, many Ypsilanti residents 

continued to ride the industrial wave, working 
in manufacturing jobs across the city.

MORE THAN RUST: THE STORY OF YPSILANTI

BY AARICA MARSH, 
OPINION COLUMNIST

Shops on Cross St. are shown in the popular area of Ypsilanti known as Depot Town. Depot Town has now assumed the role of the popular downtown destination.


More than 50 million Americans cast 

ballots in the 2000 presidential elec-
tion, and by a margin of 543,895 votes, 
Democrat Al Gore emerged victorious 
in the popular vote contest. But it didn’t 
matter. Gore’s half-million-vote advan-
tage meant nothing in the Electoral 
College, where Republican George W. 
Bush prevailed, 271 to 266, winning the 
first of his two terms as president.

The 2000 election, to many vot-

ers, seemed convoluted and indirect. 
Instead of simply awarding the election 
to the candidate with the most votes, 
the 50 states and the District of Colum-
bia awarded their electoral delegates 
to the candidate with the most votes 
in their individual elections. Despite 
Gore’s clear overall national advan-
tage, the election ended up depending 
on the outcome of Bush v. Gore, a case 
centering on a recount that would have 
decided who won Florida’s 25 electoral 
votes. The official tally maintains that 
Bush won the state, and the presidency 
with it, by a miniscule 537 votes.

The result reawakened a national 

frustration surrounding the presiden-
tial election process. Among those most 
frustrated was Michigan state Sen. 
Rebekah Warren (D–Ann Arbor) — cur-
rently among the sponsors of a piece of 
legislation that would ensure a popular-
vote winner won’t ever lose a presiden-
tial election again.

“2000 brought to mind for a lot of 

folks that this could happen, and that 
it could happen more frequently,” War-
ren said. The Electoral College, War-
ren said, has “outlived its usefulness,” 
and elections like 2000’s make many 
in non-swing states feel their vote for 
president is inconsequential.

So what’s the solution? In Warren’s 

world, it’s a piece of legislation cur-
rently referred to as Michigan Senate 
Bill 88: “A bill to enter into the inter-
state compact to elect the president by 
national popular vote.”

Warren has taken the lead on the bill 

in Michigan, and equivalent legislation 
has already been enacted in Hawaii, 
California, Washington, Illinois, Mary-
land, New Jersey, New York, Massachu-
setts, Rhode Island, Vermont and the 
District of Columbia — each proposing 
a fundamental change to the way the 
jurisdictions award their electoral del-
egates. Instead of awarding votes based 
on which candidate wins the state’s 
popular vote, the states would award 
their electoral delegates to the winner 
of the national popular vote, effectively 

rendering the Electoral College useless.

The catch, of course, is that each of 

the already passed legislative actions 
only takes effect when 270 electoral 
votes’ worth of states, the amount 
required to win an election, have signed 
on to what’s now called the Nation-
al Popular Vote Interstate Compact. 
Those 11 state jurisdictions account for 
165, and Michigan’s 16 electoral votes 
would push the total to 181, more than 
two-thirds of the amount required to 

win a presidential election.

“The underpinning of our democ-

racy is the idea: one person, one vote,” 
Warren said. “What you’ve seen these 
last few cycles with some battleground 
presidential elections is that those 
swing states are the ones with a lot of 
Electoral College votes, and they get 
most of the visits by presidential candi-
dates. It means people like us in Michi-
gan, which is sometimes considered a 
spectator state in presidential elections, 
don’t get the same kind of attention.”

Michigan tends to have a dramatic 

Democratic tilt every four years — no 
Republican presidential candidate has 
won the state since George H.W. Bush 
in 1988, meaning it doesn’t get as much 
attention from campaigns, despite 
many Republicans in statewide office. 
But Warren said the problem is far 
wider than the presidential campaigns 
themselves, and that candidates’ lack of 
attention for certain states during the 
campaign translates to a similar lack of 
attention once they’re elected.

“When those folks get into office, we 

see those states get more federal grant 
money,” Warren said.

She added that Electoral College has 

left many voters feeling disenchanted 
with the democratic process, which 
Warren said poses risks to voter turn-
out and overall civic engagement.

“I’ve worked a lot in my career on 

efforts to increase access to the ballot, 
and I truly believe in a nonpartisan way 
that democracy works best when more 
people vote,” Warren said. “What I hear 
from too many folks is that the Elector-
al College system makes people feel like 
their vote for president doesn’t count. 
How do you get people to be invested 
and educated in their vote when they 
feel like it doesn’t mean very much?”

The conservative opposition to War-

ren’s bill takes a different tune. Some 
opponents of the bill, currently sitting 
in the Senate Elections and Govern-
ment Reform Committee, say it would 
take away voting power from smaller 
states and rural areas that currently feel 
they have a voice in contested presiden-
tial elections — a voice that would be 
diminished within the grand scheme of 
a popular vote for president.

Michigan state Sen. Dave Robertson 

(R–Grand Blanc) chairs the committee. 
Though his office did not respond to 
The Michigan Daily’s requests for com-
ment, Robertson is on record saying the 
panel is willing to debate the issues, 
but does not expect changes in the near 
future — especially for the 2016 elec-
tion cycle.

Another topic of concern is wheth-

er states themselves should have the 
power to change the election process 
on a federal level. The more direct 
approach would simply be to amend 
the United States Constitution, instead 
of relying on a web of state-level legis-

lation to enact nationwide change.

“I think it’s like a lot of social change 

— things like civil rights and women’s 
rights movements — it starts at the 
state level and percolates up,” Warren 
said. “I would agree that the front-door 
approach makes a lot of sense. But this 
is what I can do to try to make a differ-
ence. I have to start here. That said, I 

certainly have encouraged members of 
our congressional delegation to take 
this forward to Congress.”

The bill’s supporters say the prior-

ity should be preventing 2000, and less 
recent history, from repeating itself.

Bush’s election was the third time 

in American history that a presidential 
candidate lost the popular vote but won 
presidential elections anyway. Ruther-
ford B. Hayes lost the popular vote by a 
margin of 250,000 in 1876, but became 
president anyway. Benjamin Harrison 
fell 90,000 votes short in 1888, but ran 
away with a 233-168 win in the Elector-
al College.

The effort to prevent a popular-vote 

winner losing for a fourth time is being 
spearheaded almost entirely by liberal 
politicians who ideologically tend to be 
less concerned over states’ rights. Now 
that the Compact has picked up the 
lowest-hanging fruit — the 10 states to 
have passed it are arguably the coun-
try’s 10 most politically liberal — its 
next challenge is in picking up votes 
from more moderate states, some of 
which have already seen popular-vote 
legislation introduced.

Among them are Michigan, Min-

nesota and Pennsylvania — all solidly 
blue states good for another 46 com-
bined electoral votes, which would 
push the measure ever closer to having 
legal force. A version of Senate Bill 88 
passed the Michigan House of Repre-
sentatives in 2008, but the current 27-11 
Republican advantage in the state Sen-
ate means the bill’s odds of advancing 
out of committee, much less being suc-
cessfully brought to vote, likely rest on 
the Democrats retaking the chamber at 
some point in the future. At that point 
it would likely have to be reintroduced 
because a new legislative session will 
have started.

“My goal is obviously to encourage 

the chairman to have another hear-
ing and another vote,” Warren said. “It 
would be great to have it pass not only 
one chamber but to actually pass. Many 
other jurisdictions — 11 now — have 
actually passed it, and we’re getting 
closer.”

The four presidential candidates still 

in the mix for 2016 will spend the year’s 
remaining months on a quest for 270 
electoral votes. But if Warren and the 
rest of the largely unknown movement 
get their way, candidates in future elec-
tions will be competing for something 
different: the vote of the American peo-
ple. Nothing more and nothing less.

Why I Love Rick’s

By Michael Schramm, 
Special Projects Manager

Close your eyes and envision a 

moment in the place you most enjoy. A 
space where you feel utterly happy, free 
and liberated, where you can unequiv-
ocally be yourself, free from judgment 
or insecurity. You catch yourself gaz-
ing wistfully around. Taking in the 
moment, you breathe, exhale, belong, 
feel alive — like the cosmos and the 
stars created this moment just for you.

Nestled in the basement of a dark, 

damp college bar, I feel those moments 
at Rick’s.

And in those moments my skin is 

warm and my heart booms. The feel-
ing’s powerful, yet it’s completely 
mine — meaningful, strange and goofy 
without being overly sappy.

Those moments are like one on the 

Rick’s stage the week before Christ-
mas. Someone hands me a Santa 
cap and I put it on, squat down by a 
black pole and pose with it, grimac-
ing. They’re screaming the lyrics to 
“Anaconda” and hopping onto a stage. 
They’re taking pictures of my friends 
that turn out so weird my lungs grasp 
for air as I scream from laughing.

I love Rick’s, and everyone that 

knows me knows it. In some ways, it’s 
obvious why I’d love a space that exists 
for people to have fun.

Yet my love digs deeper, translucent 

and difficult to articulate. 

***

Freshman year was incredibly diffi-

cult for me. I struggled to find a group 
on campus where I belonged.

It wasn’t always that people were 

mean or awful; I met some people 
I still consider friends. But as I was 
around different crowds of people, I 
found myself unable to find a group 
that entirely meshed with my person-
ality. It’s hard to explain why or how, 
but it was in the subtleties where I felt 
I was on a different wavelength than 
people around me.

My humor (and entire personal-

ity) is formed on a foundation of utter 
irony, stupidity and lightheartedness. 
In my personal life, I take almost noth-
ing seriously.

One time I saw a child running 

away from his mom on the street. As 
the mom chased him down, scream-
ing for him to come back, I muttered 
“me” under my breath. I laughed at the 
thought of being a small child running 
aimlessly and dangerously.

Another time I took screenshots of 

Justin Bieber’s album picture where 
he holds a sign saying, “What do you 

mean?” I started using it as a 

meme, texting people it when I disap-
proved of or was confused by some-
thing going on in life. I started seeking 
out confusing moments to send the 
screenshot. I think it’s so stupid and 
funny that I can’t stop.

No one laughed at the weird things 

that I did, and so I felt like no one was 
connecting with me.

The isolation always came to a head 

on Friday nights as I went to parties 
with different groups.

I’d head out to frat houses, and we’d 

step into the dark basements. I wasn’t 
close with anyone at these parties, and 
being gay, I was only further separat-
ed. Each night I watched the guys split 
up to find girls, while my girl friends 
were chatted up by frat guys who 
offered them drinks.

I just wanted to be goofy and do 

weird things and laugh. But that never 
happened.

Drops of sweat would rain down my 

face as I’d realize the basement’s heat. 
It was caused by the energy of every-
one dancing, moving, talking, hook-
ing up. Everyone seemed to be having 
fun, like they were in a rhythm that I 
wasn’t. Linked by a mutually under-
stood tick much like the music’s beat.

I moved my body as I circled the 

area, trying to join the tick. But as I 
kept circling I realized how out of 
synch I was compared to everyone 
else.

Tick. A group of frat guys in white 

shirts and backwards caps laugh 
together with beer in their hands. 
They’re in the same frat and clearly 
don’t wanna talk to me. Tick. A group 
of girls asks a guy for his handle of 
Crystal Palace. They all laugh as he 
hands it to them. He definitely doesn’t 
want me interrupting. Tick. Someone 
I know puts his hands on his girl-

friend’s hips, as they look at each 
other, starstruck. Tick.

After an hour my heart would sink 

too low and I’d feel all alone and I’d 
race out to escape those parties. I’d 
take the bus to my Bursley dorm. I laid 
in bed unable to sleep. With opened 
eyes, crinkled toes and a broken spirit, 
thoughts bounced around my mind, 
unwilling to stop.

I wondered why this was happening 

to me, why I bumped shoulders with 
hundreds of people yet was unable to 
tell one I wasn’t OK. That I was lost 
and increasingly ashamed of who I 
was, undervalued and shoved to the 
side.

I left freshman year aching but with 

a goal: sophomore year would be bet-
ter.

In the all-sophomore dorm of Stock-

well I found other people who had bad 
freshman years and were looking for 
people that understood them. Then 
I joined The Michigan Daily, where 
I found writers who understood my 
weird wit. Junior year I joined a gen-
eral honors fraternity, where I found a 
group of goofballs interested in joining 
a fraternity with no specialization but 
looking for a home.

All of these years, friends and mem-

ories were meaningful, but Rick’s is 
the culmination of all of them.

Contrary to popular belief, I don’t 

believe Rick’s is equivalent to a frat 
basement. My friends rarely get hit on, 
and I can see almost anyone there.

That’s why Rick’s is special to me: 

it acts as a vessel to see people who I 
really love in an environment where I 
can be myself.

As I squat, hop, groove, yell, pose 

and make weird memories with my 
friends, I feel liberated. There, I’m 
allowed to tick in whatever rhythm I 
like, and I’m synchronized with each 
beat.

I see a group 

of girls I adore and give them the fierc-
est hug. I yell a random inside joke, 
and they smile. Tick. My friend sees 
her ex-boyfriend and we yell, “What is 
the truth!” — my favorite weird phrase 
— and laugh. Tick. My friends gather 
around to dance to “Anaconda.” Tick. 
I close my eyes and belong and feel 
invincible as I clench my fists, nod my 
head and sway my hips.

Tick.

***

As the school year ends, many of 

my friends one year younger are turn-
ing 21 and going to Rick’s for the first 
time. They tell me they have to see me 
there, and I excitedly tell them I’ll do 
anything to be with them on their spe-
cial night.

Your first time at Rick’s can be very 

nerveracking. You’ve never been there 
before, your friends may not be 21 and 
you may have yet to find your tick in 
college. That last one scares me the 
most — because it’s so easy to feel 
alone and tell no one.

That’s why I want to be with my 

friends for their first time in Rick’s, so 
they have someone they feel comfort-
able with by their side.

And it’s one of the best parts of 

Rick’s. I love seeing a new friend in a 
space I’m so fond of. As I grab their 
hand and tug them to the stage, I just 
want to be goofy and make them smile. 
As I see them acclimating to the space, 
I can sense their tick, like the faint 
pulse of a heartbeat. A reaffirmation 
that whatever’s going on with them, 
this space can give them some sense 
of community. It can make them smile, 
even if outside those walls life seems 
dark.

That’s why I love Rick’s; it’s my 

space, and because of that, I want it to 
be everyone else’s too.

On Sunday, the UM Hindu Students Council hosted a Holi event on Palmer Field. Holi, 

also known as “The Festival of Colors”, is a Hindu celebration of the triumph of good 
over evil. Participants danced and threw colored powder on each other and in the air, 

as well as on my camera. The day was full of smiles and a great time for everyone 

who went and celebrated.
