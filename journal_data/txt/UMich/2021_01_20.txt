A Washtenaw County woman 

has contracted the new B.1.1.7. 
COVID-19 variant, the first known 
case in the state of Michigan, 
according to a press release from 
the Michigan Department of 
Health and Human Services. 
The woman recently traveled 
to the United Kingdom, where 
the variant first appeared. Two 
new COVID-19 cases have been 
identified from close contacts 
with the woman, but it is not yet 
known whether they are caused 
by the variant.

The 
B 
1.1.7. 
case 
makes 

Michigan the 17th state to identify 
the variant within its borders. 
Though it is the only known case 
in Michigan, it is possible there 
are more that have not been 
identified, according to the press 
release. 

The new variant is believed to 

be more contagious, but not any 
more severe, than the original 
COVID-19 virus that has been 
circulating in the United States 
since early 2020. The higher rate 
of transmission could increase the 
number of hospitalizations and 
deaths resulting from the virus if 
it spreads widely in Michigan. 

Joneigh Khaldun, chief medical 

executive 
and 
chief 
deputy 

director for health at MDHHS, 
said in the press release that to 
combat spread of the new variant, 
Michiganders should continue 
to wear masks, social distance, 
avoid crowds, wash their hands 
often and make a plan for getting a 
vaccine when it’s their turn.

“The discovery of this variant 

in Michigan is concerning, but not 
unexpected,” Khaldun said. “We 
all have a personal responsibility 
to slow the spread of COVID-19 
and end this pandemic as quickly 
as possible.”

The B.1.1.7 variant’s arrival 

comes as local health departments 
charged 
with 
administering 

vaccines struggle to keep pace 
with high demand while receiving 
lower than expected supply of 
doses. While Michigan officially 
began Phase 1B — which includes 
senior 
citizens 
and 
frontline 

essential workers — on Monday, 
it may not have enough vaccines 
to vaccinate most members of this 
group until a later date. 

The Washtenaw County Health 

Department announced Friday it 
would be rescheduling its Jan. 19 
appointments until Feb. 9 because 
the vaccine clinic hadn’t received 
enough supply to operate. 

The keynote lecture, focused 

around the symposium’s theme 
of “Where Do We Go From 
Here?,” touched on King’s legacy 
and his impact on current social 
justice work.

The keynote was moderated 

by Dr. Stephen Ward, associate 
professor in the Residential 
College and the Department 
of Afroamerican and African 
Studies, 
and 
featured 
two 

speakers: Dr. Gloria House, a 
University alum, poet and human 
rights activist who designed the 
African American and African 
Studies major at the University 
of Michigan - Dearborn; and 
Malik Yakini, the co-founder 
and Executive Director of the 
Detroit Black Community Food 
Security Network.

The 
lecture, 
coordinated 

by the Office of Academic 
Multicultural Initiatives, is part 
of a larger program of events 
surrounding King’s legacy from 
January through March. 

Lumas Helaire, coordinator 

of the Martin Luther King 
Jr. Symposium and associate 
director of OAMI, said the 
speakers were chosen because 
they were especially suited to 
speak to this year’s theme. 

“They’re looking at some 

of the deepest challenges and 
issues 
within 
communities,” 

Helaire said. “We’re definitely 
looking for speakers who have 
exhibited an ability to work 
towards whatever the theme 
may be, and these two speakers 
definitely have.”

During the keynote, House 

discussed how King’s legacy 
inspires current civil rights 
activists.

“One of Dr. King’s many 

legacies to us as social justice 

advocates is the way he directed 
our attention past any given 
moment of crisis or hardship to 
a time when our communities 
would 
achieve 
justice 
and 

dignity for everyone,” House 
said. “He bequeathed us the 
spirit of hope and perseverance.”

House 
discussed 
her 

involvement 
with 
several 

Detroit-based organizations that 
work to organize and support 
Black communities, including 
the Black Legacy Coalition of the 
Charles H. Wright Museum and 
Riverwise Magazine. 

“These 
organizations 
are 

part of a network of hundreds of 
involved community organizing 
efforts in Detroit,” House said. 
“As social justice advocates, 
or those people who work for 
liberation of our communities, 
we want to counteract the 
despair 
that 
settles 
over 

communities when our rights are 
violated and our representative 
institutions are circumvented or 
usurped.” 

Echoing House, Yakini said 

the social justice work currently 
happening in Black communities 
is often tied to deeper problems 
in American society.

“I 
think 
the 
thing 
that 

we’re realizing now is that all 
of this work is intersectional 
because all of these problems 
are really caused by the same 
root problems: capitalism, white 
supremacy 
and 
patriarchy,” 

Yakini said. 

Both 
speakers 
discussed 

the impact of the Civil Rights 
Movement of the 1960s and 
1970s on their lives and current 
work. Yakini said Civil Rights 
leaders such as Malcolm X 
played a role in his development 
as a Black man and social justice 
advocate.

A resident of Washtenaw County has contracted a new variant of COVID-19.

Former Governor Rick Snyder, eight 
others charged in Flint water crisis
Previous top MI officials facing counts of willful neglect of duty

FILE PHOTO/Daily

Former Michigan Governor Rick Snyder has been charged in the Flint water crisis. 

Former Gov. Rick Snyder 

(R), 
as 
well 
as 
Snyder’s 

ex-health director and other 
former health officials, are 
being charged in relation to 
the Flint, Mich. water crisis 
following a new investigation, 
according to the Associated 
Press.

Snyder, 
who 
pleaded 

not 
guilty 
in 
a 
Thursday 

morning 
court 
appearance, 

is being charged with two 
misdemeanor counts of willful 
neglect of duty.

Governmental malpractice 

left the majority-Black city of 
Flint with lead-contaminated 
water for years, causing at least 
12 deaths and ongoing health 
issues for many community 

members, especially children.

Multiple 
sources 
with 

knowledge 
of 
the 
planned 

prosecution told the AP the 
defendants were informed of 
the indictments by the United 
States attorney general’s office 
on Tuesday. 

Courtney 
Covington 

Watkins, a spokesperson for 
the Attorney General’s office, 
told the AP investigators are 
“working diligently” and “will 
share more as soon as we’re in 
a position to do so.” 

None 
of 
those 
facing 

charges nor Gov. Gretchen 
Whitmer 
immediately 

released public statements. 
Michigan Attorney General 
Dana 
Nessel 
praised 
the 

prosecutions. 

Snyder’s 
two 
terms 
as 

governor ended in 2014. Under 
his 
administration, 
Flint’s 

water supply — used by nearly 
100,000 
residents 
— 
was 

switched from Lake Huron 
and the Detroit River to the 
Flint River to reduce costs. 
The water was not correctly 
treated 
and 
corroded 
the 

old pipes, leading to lead-
contaminated 
water. 
The 

city is still in the process 
of replacing the corrupted 
pipelines. 

A 2018 report, partially 

funded by the University of 
Michigan, said the former 
governor “bears significant 
legal 
responsibility” 
for 

his 
role 
overseeing 
the 

state agencies in charge of 
protecting 
public 
health. 

The report also said Snyder 
neglected his duties in failing 
to address the crisis sooner.

Members of U-M community call for 
recall or resignation of Ron Weiser
Students, faculty criticize the regent’s prominent role in the Michigan GOP

University of Michigan community 

members are calling for the resignation 
or recall of Regent Ron Weiser (R) 
from the University’s Board of Regents, 
condemning Weiser for not specifically 
denouncing President Donald Trump 
for inciting violence at the U.S. Capitol 
on Wednesday. 

A petition begun by students 

Friday, which has garnered over 4,000 
signatures, calls on Weiser to resign 
due to his past involvement with the 
Michigan Republican Party and the 
Trump administration.

“The evidence is clear: Ron Weiser 

is complicit in Wednesday’s historic 
and horrifying events, and continues 
to defend their instigators,” the petition 
reads. “We demand that he either 
resign or be recalled by the Board of 
Regents, and we expect President 
Schlissel to condemn this threat to all 
students of color on campus.”

The petition is endorsed by the 

past five Central Student Government 
presidents, including the 2020 CSG 
president and vice president, public 
policy senior Amanda Kaplan and 
LSA 
senior 
Saveri 
Nandigama, 

respectively. Prominent University 
groups, including the Climate Action 
Movement, 
the 
U-M 
Graduate 

Employees’ 
Organization, 
the 

University’s Roosevelt Society chapter 
and the One University campaign have 
also signed on.

Because 
regents 
are 
elected 

statewide, an approved recall petition 
must garner signatures from 25 percent 
of the number of Michigan voters in the 
2020 general election. The change.org 
petition is not recognized by the state 
of Michigan as an approved recall 

petition. The requirement of more than 
a million signatures within 60 days 
of the first signature makes Weiser’s 
recall unlikely. 

Dozens of faculty members have 

also signed an open letter released 
Saturday demanding that Weiser 
resign immediately from his position as 
regent. While acknowledging that it is 
unclear whether Michigan Republican 
Party members directly participated in 
Wednesday’s riots, the petition states 
that Weiser’s role as incoming chair of 
Michigan GOP is incompatible with his 
duty as regent. 

“As a University of Michigan 

Regent, you serve as the public face 
of a great university that champions 
the pursuit of truth and a genuinely 
just society,” the petition reads. “By 
contrast, as chair of MI-GOP, you will 
be required to promote policies and 
strategies that MI-GOP uses to pursue 
electoral 
victories. 
This 
includes 

placating violent extremists within 
your party as well as those who support 
or tolerate them.”

The call for Weiser’s resignation 

or recall comes after the regent told 
Bridge Magazine on Thursday he did 
not know if he blamed Trump for the 
Wednesday riots. 

“I didn’t read any of that stuff, and I 

didn’t watch television,” Weiser said. “I 
watched Michigan destroy Minnesota 
in basketball, and that kind of contest is 
something that I strongly support.”

He tweeted a full statement on 

Wednesday’s riot later Thursday 
following the publication of the Bridge 
article. 

“I strongly condemn those people 

who turned into a mob and breached 
the Capitol after what was supposed to 
be a peaceful protest,” Weiser tweeted. 
“Those who broke the law should 
be held accountable. My heart goes 

out to the families of those who were 
unnecessarily harmed. The President 
said this morning that a peaceful 
transfer of power will occur and 
therefore the 2020 elections are over. It 
is time for Republicans to rest, regroup, 
and focus on defeating the Democrats 
in 2022.”

Weiser told the Detroit News 

Saturday 
he 
is 
“definitely 
not” 

resigning, and that he condemned the 
violence once he was aware of what 
had happened.

 “I spent most of that ugly day in 

a dental chair having oral surgery,” 
Weiser said. “I am guilty of not 
watching news on TV or watching or 
using social media. Nothing more... 
Because of this transgression, my 
children and grandchildren have 
been harasssed. There should be more 
civility in our community!”

Weiser declined Thursday and 

Friday to be interviewed by The 
Michigan Daily. The University Office 
of Public Affairs forwarded Weiser’s 
statement to The Daily and declined to 
comment further. 

Weiser is the incoming co-chair 

of the Michigan Republican Party 
— after current chair Laura Cox 
announced Wednesday she would 
not run for the position again — and 
former fundraising chair for the 
Republican 
National 
Committee. 

Democrats and some Republicans have 
accused Trump of inciting a coup on 
Wednesday, and multiple White House 
officials have resigned. 

Some members of Congress are 

now calling for the cabinet to invoke 
the 25th Amendment to strip Trump of 
his presidential duties, and Speaker of 
the House Nancy Pelosi has threatened 
impeachment.

Students look to Winter 2021 with 
skepticism following Fall 2020 semester

The Fall 2020 semester 

— 
which 
included 
a 

Graduate 
Employees’ 

Organization 
strike 
and 

widespread 
concerns 

about 
COVID-19 
policies 

— tested the relationship 
between 
University 
of 

Michigan students and the 
administration. 
With 
the 

start of the Winter 2021 
semester around the corner, 
many students said they hope 
the University will improve 
from last semester and apply 
lessons learned from the fall 
to have a more successful 
winter.

The Winter 2021 semester 

marks the University’s most 
overwhelmingly 
virtual 

semester, after Winter 2020’s 
mid-semester shift at the 
onset of the pandemic and 
last 
semester’s 
attempted 

hybrid 
of 
in-person 
and 

majority virtual learning.

Business freshman John 

Cook said his first semester 
of primarily virtual classes 
and 
limited 
opportunities 

for meeting other students 
was marked by disappointing 
levels 
of 
engagement. 

At times, Cook said, last 
semester felt like “watching 
YouTube videos.”

“One of the most important 

aspects 
of 
college 
— 

especially 
something 
that 

Michigan 
preaches 
— 
is 

(that) you can find people 
that you can interact with 
and engage with, and you 
can find people that push you 
to think harder,” Cook said. 
“But when it came down to 
classes, student engagement 
was zero.”

COVID-19 response

With the constant threat 

of COVID-19 looming over 
campus, University President 
Mark 
Schlissel 
sent 
out 

COVID-19 briefings to the 
University community each 
week. Some students said 
they were frustrated with 
the amount of jargon that the 
important information was 
sometimes wrapped up in, 
making it difficult to actually 
understand what was going 
on.

LSA senior Jordyn Houle 

said something a bit briefer 
than the emails that are 
occasionally sent out would 
help more people understand 
what is really going on.

“I think a lot of it is just a 

lot of rhetoric,” Houle said. 
“These things don’t get to the 
root of what the University’s 
response at any given time 
is. I think there is a lot of 
obfuscating around what’s 
going on (in the current 
briefings).”

The 
University’s 
testing 

policy last semester also fell 
under heavy scrutiny. While 

many 
other 
institutions 

implemented 
plans 
where 

students 
were 
randomly 

tested, the University’s plan 
did not mandate testing for 
all students. This semester, 
the administration changed 
course, electing to test all 
on-campus students weekly. 
Students like LSA sophomore 
Madelin Chau were surprised 
by the red tape covering 
University ordained testing 
in the fall.

“My biggest issue is how 

difficult it was to find out 
(how to be tested),” Chau 
said. 
“They 
should 
have 

made that more accessible to 
everyone.”

For the winter semester, 

the University has expanded 
testing access to all students, 
faculty and staff who live 
or work on campus. Weekly 
testing 
is 
required 
for 

undergraduate students who 
come to campus and will be 
enforced with checks of the 
newly updated ResponsiBLUE 
app upon entering University 
facilities. 
Administration 

also 
encourages 
students 

who live off campus to be 
tested regularly, particularly 
those living in Greek or co-op 
housing.

Students criticized the fact 

that some groups, including 
fraternities and sororities, 
continued to host parties 
during the fall semester. Chau 
said she would like to see the 
administration take further 
action to stop partying.

“You just hear about so 

many parties that continue to 
go on, you see it on Snapchat 
and things like that, so you 
know it’s happening,” Chau 
said. “I do think that they 
need to do something about 
that, focus more on the Greek 
Life parties.”

Throughout 
an 

unprecedented 
semester, 

criticism 
of 
the 

administration 
persisted, 

and Houle said she found 
their actions when it came 
to COVID-19 to be somewhat 
soft. Similar to Chau, Houle 
expects the administration 
to be much more proactive 
about enforcement this time 
around. 

“I think that there was a lot 

of wishful thinking that this 
was going to go away without 
taking much action,” said 
Houle.

The University announced 

in 
November 
a 
stricter, 

“no-tolerance” 
approach 

to 
COVID-19 
policy 

enforcement for the winter 
semester. University Housing 
residents 
will 
be 
placed 

on 
housing 
probation 
-- 

potentially one step from 
contract termination -- after 
their first violation. 

Tuition increase

Before the start of the fall 

semester, the majority of 
regents voted to approve a 
1.9% tuition increase, after 

initially failing to pass the 
proposed budget. Students 
criticized this decision amid 
the 
economic 
downturn 

created by the pandemic. 
LSA senior Amytess Girgis, 
a recently named Rhodes 
Scholar and student activist 
involved in the One University 
Campaign, said the University 
has a “deep obligation” to put 
its money where its mouth is, 
considering its reputation as 
a top public university.

“What COVID has really 

brought out in this university 
is just a continued lack of 
ability or desire to allocate its 
funds appropriately, whether 
it be to protect students and 
faculty during a pandemic, 
or whether it be to provide 
the necessary financial aid to 
help people get through these 
times and any other time,” 
Girgis said.

Echoing 
Girgis, 
other 

students 
also 
said 
they 

were 
frustrated 
by 
the 

juxtaposition 
between 
the 

tuition 
increase 
and 
the 

perceived decrease in the 
quality of education due to 
remote classes.

“I think the tuition increase 

last semester, in spite of not 
receiving the same quality of 
education that students here 
expect to receive, was pretty 
disappointing,” Houle said. 
“Especially considering the 
$10 billion endowment that 
they have.”

Use of University buildings 

for shelter

With 
the 
majority 
of 

University Housing contracts 
terminated for the winter 
semester, 
community 

members 
are 
now 
asking 

the administration what, if 
anything, will be done with 
empty buildings on campus. 
Ann 
Arbor 
City 
Council 

has raised the possibility of 
using empty residence halls 
to shelter the city’s homeless 
population.

Although they may have a 

difficult time imagining the 
University opening its doors, 
students that spoke to The 
Daily were very open to the 
idea.

“I don’t necessarily expect 

that the University will end 
up (housing the homeless 
population),” 
said 
Houle. 

“But in an ideal world, I think 
that they should definitely 
try to.”

Girgis, who also voiced 

support for the repurposing 
of dorms, stressed the effect 
that the University has in 
raising the cost of living in 
Ann Arbor.

“The 
university 
has 
a 

direct hand in the rates of 
homelessness in Ann Arbor 
and 
Washtenaw 
County,” 

Girgis said. “And so not only 
is it just simply the right 
thing to do. The university 
actually has a responsibility, 
to at least in some small way, 
make up for the fact that it is 

actively choosing not to make 
housing more affordable in 
Washtenaw 
County. 
And 

beyond that it’s also just the 
best course to undertake as 
far as public health goes.”

Cook 
said 
that, 
as 
a 

public university that relies 
partially on public funds, 
the University has an ethical 
responsibility to serve the 
surrounding community.

“I think it’s their duty to 

aid the homeless population 
in Ann Arbor,” Cook said. 
“So, if they have those unused 
buildings, I think that they 
should be utilized.”

University 
spokesperson 

Rick Fitzgerald told The Daily 
in 
a 
December 
interview 

that the University has been 
in touch with Washtenaw 
County officials to try to 
understand the community’s 
needs and see if there’s a way 
it could be helpful. 

Graduate Employees’ 
Organization strike

A 
week 
into 
the 
fall 

semester, 
the 
Graduate 

Employees’ 
Organization 

launched a historic strike in 
protest of the University’s 
reopening plans. Girgis said 
the 
strike 
represented 
a 

larger underlying issue with 
a lack of community input 
into University decisions. She 
pointed to the controversy 
surrounding 
Regent 
Ron 

Weiser 
(R) 
as 
another 

example of this issue of 
accountability going into the 
winter semester.

“The 
fundamental 

problem with the University 
administration, at least for 
the time that I have been 
here, is that they refuse 
to acknowledge the ways 
in 
which 
the 
University 

community can and should be 
informing their decisions,” 
Girgis said. 

Girgis, who is also an 

activist with the Lecturers’

Organization, 

emphasized that LEO will be 
in contract negotiations with 
the University this semester. 
According to Girgis, LEO is 
advocating for demands GEO 
has also campaigned for in 
the past, such as higher wages 
for University employees and 
increased childcare support. 
Last Friday, LEO held a 
bargaining kickoff rally in 
anticipation of the months of 
negotiations ahead.

“LEO 
is 
bargaining 

starting 
next 
week 
and 

(making) a lot of demands 
that 
are 
important, 
not 

only for them, but for the 
University 
community 
as 

a whole,” Girgis said. “The 
administration would do well 
to listen.”

Tenured English professor 

Douglas 
Trevor, 
former 

director of the Helen Zell 
Writers’ Program and the 
Hopwood Awards Program, 
is not allowed to conduct 
office hours with his door 
closed or meet with students 
in off-campus spaces for 
the next two years. These 
sanctions were instituted in 
an April 30, 2020 letter from 
LSA Dean Anne Curzan. 

According 
to 
the 

confidential letter, addressed 
to 
Trevor 
and 
obtained 

by 
The 
Michigan 
Daily, 

Trevor is also barred from 
holding formal leadership 
positions at the University 
of Michigan for the next two 
years, though Curzan wrote 
that his professional conduct 
would be re-evaluated at the 
end of this period. Trevor 
will also not be eligible for 
a merit increase in his base 
salary in the next faculty 
salary program.

As Trevor continues to 

teach at the University — 
with 
two 
undergraduate 

classes scheduled for Winter 
2021 — a Daily investigation 
into Trevor has unearthed 
two previously undisclosed 
allegations of harassment, 
retaliation and intimidation 
against Trevor. The Daily 
has also learned of one 
previously 
undisclosed 

allegation that when a Helen 
Zell student came to him 
with concerns about another 
faculty member’s behavior, 
Trevor warned the student 
against 
threatening 
the 

educational environment.

These allegations, made 

by three female students 
and staff at the University 
between 
2016 
and 
2019, 

date back to January 2017 
and extend to April 2019. 
These accounts have been 
corroborated 
by 
friends, 

fellow 
students 
and 

colleagues of the women who 
were present at the time. 
The Daily has also reviewed 

correspondence 
between 

Trevor and the women who 
shared their accounts as well 
as between administrators.

Trevor was the director 

of the Helen Zell Writers’ 
Program — the University’s 
prestigious creative writing 
graduate program — from 
2016 until December 2018, 
when 
he 
stepped 
down, 

citing family-related reasons 
in an email to program 
participants. In Fall 2018, he 
also directed the Hopwood 
Program, 
which 
hosts 

creative 
writing 
awards 

for University students and 
partners 
frequently 
with 

Helen Zell, stepping down 
from that directorship at the 
end of the year as well. 

In response to an email 

from 
The 
Daily, 
Curzan 

declined 
to 
comment 
on 

this 
letter. 
University 

spokesperson 
Rick 

Fitzgerald 
noted 
in 
an 

interview with The Daily 
that the University does 
not comment on personnel 
matters 
to 
respect 
the 

privacy 
of 
employees. 

Fitzgerald added that this 
letter from Curzan “speaks 
for itself.”

Curzan’s April 2020 letter 

followed an OIE investigation 
into Trevor, which concluded 
in February 2020. The OIE 
investigation 
did 
not 
find 

Trevor’s 
conduct 
to 
be 

“sufficiently severe, persistent 
or 
pervasive 
to 
create 
a 

sexually hostile environment,” 
but Curzan wrote that Trevor 
had “created an intimidating, 
hostile, and offensive climate” 
in the Helen Zell Writers’ 
Program.

In an email to The Daily, 

Trevor denied that he had ever 
engaged in sexual misconduct. 
In 
addressing 
other 

allegations, 
he 
referenced 

the 
findings 
of 
the 
OIE 

investigation, writing that OIE 
found the allegations to not be 
“valid.”

“After this investigation, the 

OIE correctly determined that 
I did not violate any University 
policies 
related 
to 
sexual 

harassment,” Trevor wrote. 

“I am saddened by the amount 
of misinformation that has 
circulated about me in recent 
times. I want students to 
know that sexual misconduct 
should not be tolerated and 
that I fully support university 
policies that regulate behavior 
by faculty and staff.”

The 
OIE 
investigation 

into 
Trevor 
was 
initiated 

in April 2018 by then-LSA 
junior Emma Richter. The 
Daily spoke to Richter, whose 
allegations make up one of the 
three reported in this article, 
about her claims of sexual 
misconduct 
against 
Trevor 

while she worked for the 
Hopwood Program.

(Richter formerly worked 

for The Daily as a staff 
photographer from September 
2016 
to 
December 
2018. 

The Daily spoke with two 
individuals 
familiar 
with 

Richter’s 
situation 
and 

reviewed email and iMessage 
correspondence from Trevor, 
corroborating the consistency 
of her allegations.)

Apart 
from 
the 
three 

allegations reported in this 
article, 
two 
anonymous 

allegations 
of 
sexual 

misconduct 
against 
Trevor 

were also posted in June 
2020 on the Twitter account 
Assaulters 
at 
UMich, 
an 

anonymous 
account 
that 

posted a series of tweets 
calling out multiple alleged 
assaulters on campus. One of 
the two posts also claimed 
that the writer’s allegations 
against 
Trevor 
had 
been 

“severely mishandled.”

Amid 
the 
numerous 

allegations that were posted on 
the account against members 
of the University community, 
Trevor was the only University 
professor to appear on the 
account. Like many allegations 
on the account, those against 
Trevor 
are 
unverified 
by 

The 
Daily. 
The 
Assaulters 

at UMich account did not 
respond to multiple requests 
for comment.

The 
allegations 
against 

Trevor follow a larger pattern 
of alleged abuse from tenured 
faculty 
and 
deterrents 
to 

reporting at the University 
and in higher education more 
broadly. In 2020, three women 
came forward alleging decades’ 
worth of sexual harassment 
from 
Martin 
Philbert, 
the 

University’s former provost 
who held the office from 2017 
through January 2020, when 
he was placed on leave. 

Also 
in 
2020, 
other 

allegations 
of 
sexual 

misconduct 
were 
brought 

against the late University 
doctor Robert E. Anderson and 
Jason Mars, assistant professor 
of computer science. The latter 
has recently faced controversy 
for his continued teaching 
appointment at the University. 
The 
Daily 
also 
uncovered 

previously 
undisclosed 

allegations 
against 
former 

School of Music, Theatre & 
Dance 
professors 
Stephen 

Shipps and David Daniels in 
2018. 

In a follow-up email to The 

Daily regarding the allegations 
against Trevor, Fitzgerald said 
the English Department is 
working to resolve inequities.

“We also can tell you that 

the leadership team in the 
English Department and LSA 
are addressing these matters,” 
Fitzgerald wrote. “Knowing 
there is always more to do to 
improve equity and inclusivity, 
the department is engaged in a 
number of ongoing initiatives 
to ensure that all voices are 
heard and all members of the 
community feel included.”

“It got worse over time”

Richter was an LSA junior in 

April 2018 when she received 
an email from Trevor, who she 
had met the previous month 
through her work-study job 
for the Hopwood Program. In 
the email, Trevor wrote that 
he had reported Richter to OIE 
for having an inappropriate 
romantic 
relationship 
with 

another faculty member — an 
allegation both the faculty 
member and Richter deny. The 
Daily was provided a copy of 
this email.

Richter said Trevor’s email 

caught her off guard. Earlier 

that same day, she had gone 
to OIE to consider reporting 
two professors she alleged 
were sexually harassing her. 
One was the faculty member 
Trevor alleged she was in a 
relationship with. 

The other was Trevor. 
“It was funny — in a dark 

way — to me,” Richter said. 
“That Doug would do that just 
seems ridiculous.”

Richter alleged that before 

and 
after 
receiving 
this 

email, from March 2018 to 
October 2018, Trevor sexually 
harassed her while she worked 
in the Hopwood Room, which 
houses offices for Hopwood 
Program 
leadership 
and 

often functions as a venue for 
Helen Zell-affiliated events. 
According to Richter, Trevor 
made inappropriate advances 
toward 
her 
outside 
the 

workplace as well, inviting her 
to get drinks after University-
affiliated events and taking 
her out for coffee in a manner 
that made her uncomfortable.

Richter 
said 
she 
first 

met Trevor a month before 
receiving his email, when he 
was the Helen Zell director 
but had not yet become the 
Hopwood director. She said 
they met at a Helen Zell 
welcome event, where she had 
been asked to take photos. 

The event had an open bar, 

and Richter said Trevor had 
clearly drank before he struck 
up a conversation with her and 
invited her to join him and 
another faculty member for 
drinks after the event. One of 
the individuals contacted by 
The Daily confirmed they had 
witnessed the invitation.

Richter 
remembered 

declining the invitation and 
stating that she was underaged. 
But Trevor allegedly insisted 
she accompany them, arguing 
she shouldn’t walk home from 
the event alone. According to 
Richter, after repeated urging 
from Trevor, Richter accepted 
the invitation.

Richter, 
Trevor 
and 
the 

other professor went to the 
Raven’s Club, where Richter 
said that she witnessed Trevor 
gossip 
about 
Helen 
Zell 

students’ sex lives.

“It was … like making fun 

in a mean way,” Richter said. 
“The other piece of it that 
was uncomfortable was … in 
contrast … (Trevor) saying and, 
directed towards me, being 
like, ‘You’re so mature, Emma, 
you know. You completely get 
it.’”

That 
evening 
was 
only 

the 
beginning 
of 
several 

encounters 
with 
Trevor 

that Richter said made her 
uncomfortable. The site of 
these subsequent encounters 
was 
frequently 
Richter’s 

workplace, 
especially 
with 

Trevor set to take over as 
Hopwood 
Director 
in 
Fall 

2018.

Richter also alleged that 

Trevor would regularly hug her 
and touch her inappropriately 
on the shoulders, hand and 
small of her back outside of 
that encounter.

“It got worse over time,” 

Richter said. “You know, the 
small of your back becomes 
your butt.”

In one specific encounter, 

Richter alleges that Trevor 
saw her in the Hopwood 
Room, where he walked up to 
her and began rubbing her arm 
while pointing out she hadn’t 
responded to an invitation to 
coffee with him. Richter said 
this interaction made her feel 
like agreeing to coffee was 
“something I have to do.” The 
Daily 
reviewed 
iMessages 

between Trevor and Richter 
after their coffee meeting.

“Yes, that was fun,” Trevor 

texted Richter after they went 
to coffee. “Let’s do it again 
sometime soon. Good luck 
with all your responsibilities!! 
Remember to make time to 
feed the soul.”

Richter decided to formally 

report Trevor and went to 
OIE on April 23, 2018. Richter 
shared 
that 
this 
process 

presented 
frustrations 
of 

its own, particularly after 
Richter learned that her case 
had been transferred from one 
investigator to another in May 
2018. 

Daily investigation finds allegations of harassment, 
retaliation and intimidation against English professor

A spokesperson for Snyder 

has previously said the state 
took proactive steps to work 
with communities on the issues 
caused by the crisis.

Bacteria in the damaged 

water 
resulted 
in 
at 
least 

90 cases of a severe form 
of pneumonia and at least 
12 
deaths. 
Former 
health 

director Nick Lyon, one of 
the 
individuals 
charged, 

previously said he knew of 
the reported cases months 
before 
the 
outbreak 
was 

publicly addressed by Snyder 

in January 2016. 

Lyon was previously accused 

of involuntary manslaughter 
charges for failing to inform 
the public about the outbreak 
in a timely manner. In June 
2019, 
prosecutors 
working 

under Nessel dismissed the 
case, as well as charges against 
seven other individuals.

The 
disaster 
in 
Flint 

gained national recognition, 
with 
many 
criticizing 
the 

city and state for extensive 
governmental mismanagement, 
environmental 
degradation 

and racial bias. 

The 
Michigan 
Court 
of 

Appeals is hearing a large 
group of ongoing cases between 

multiple plaintiffs and the state 
of Michigan and the city of 
Flint, among other defendants. 
It is likely many of those cases 
will be resolved in a settlement 
between 
residents 
and 
the 

city and state, though some 
have protested the possible 
agreement saying it did not 
include all necessary measures.

This article has been updated 

to include the specific charges 
announced 
against 
former 

Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder.

Five people have died from injuries 

or conditions inflicted at the Capitol 
Wednesday, including a Capitol police 
officer. 

Meshawn 
Maddock, 
Weiser’s 

co-chair running mate, organized 
buses to take Michiganders to 
Washington D.C. Wednesday. In a 
Thursday tweet, Maddock wrote 
that she condemns the violence 
and breaching of the Capitol “in the 
strongest possible terms.”

“The rally was supposed to be a 

peaceful event and people who broke 
the law should be held accountable,” 
Maddock wrote. “I am horrified at the 
death of the young woman and pray for 
the healing of our nation.”

Maddock 
is 
director 
of 
the 

Michigan 
Conservative 
Coalition, 

which in a Wednesday morning email 
to members prayed that God “convict” 
members of Congress, judges and other 
elected officials who have “refused to 
get involved” in overturning Biden’s 
election victory. 

“The real war we are fighting is 

for the spiritual soul and God-given 
destiny of our nation,” the email reads.

Weiser told Bridge on Thursday that 

Maddock was watching the chaos in 
D.C. from a hotel room window.

“I don’t believe she was part of it,” 

Weiser said. “I don’t believe she incited 
it.”

LSA junior Ryan Fisher, chairman 

of the University’s College Republicans, 
condemned the petition in a text 
message to The Daily. 

“This is an insignificant attack 

on a great regent, one that is unlikely 
to succeed,” Fisher wrote. “The 

accusations levied by recall proponents 
are empty and impetuous.”

Public Policy senior Ben Gerstein, 

former Central Student Government 
president, expressed his support for the 
petition in a tweet Friday afternoon, 
demanding University administrators 
and President Mark Schlissel notice 
the call for Weiser’s resignation or 
recall.

“Beyond his role in elevating 

President Trump’s fascist movement, 
Regent Weiser has shielded himself 
from scrutiny through both his 
personal donations to the University 
and his position on the Board of 
Regents,” Gerstein tweeted. “As the 
former and incoming Chairman of 
the Michigan GOP, and his past role as 
the RNC’s fundraising coordinator for 
President Trump, he is complicit in the 
events that culminated in Wednesday’s 
attempted white supremacist coup.”

Douglas Trevor continues to teach, but is barred from meeting students off-campus, holding leadership positions for two years

 ALEC COHEN/Daily


When this investigator first 

contacted her, Richter alleged 
that one of the first things he told 
her was that he was surprised 
she was reporting Trevor. The 
investigator allegedly said he 
had worked with Trevor after 
Trevor reported Richter and 
the other faculty member to 
OIE and — according to Richter 
— the investigator said Trevor 
was a “great guy.” One of the 
individuals contacted by The 
Daily confirmed that Richter 
shared this story with them at 
the time.

“After he said that, I just 

checked out,” Richter said.

As 
a 
result 
of 
these 

frustrations, Richter said she 
decided to take a step back from 
the investigation in late May 
2018. Over the summer, she 
heard little from Trevor. 

However, with Trevor poised 

to 
take 
over 
as 
Hopwood 

Director in Fall 2018 and to 
move into an office adjoined 
to the Hopwood Room, one of 
Richter’s supervisors contacted 
Trevor around this time to 
request that he wait to move 
into the office until the end of 
summer, according to an April 
25, 2018 email obtained by The 
Daily. The supervisor advised 
him to delay his move to create 
a “more comfortable working 
environment” 
for 
Richter, 

who was still working in the 
Hopwood Room. 

Trevor wrote back that he 

took issue with the suggestion.

“(Y)our email is obviously 

unsettling to me as it implies 
that 
my 
presence 
in 
the 

Hopwood 
Director’s 
office 

would make Emma Richter 
uncomfortable,” Trevor wrote 
in response.

Ultimately, 
Richter 
said 

that Trevor moved into the 
office at the beginning of 
the Fall 2018 semester, but 
problems 
continued. 
With 

Trevor officially stationed 
in the director’s office and 
without 
any 
enforceable 

measures 
preventing 
her 

from having to see Trevor, 
Richter said the situation 
worsened. 

To avoid further encounters 

with Trevor in the Hopwood 
Room, Richter said she took 
three weeks off of paid time 
off in October 2018. She also 
took a week off of her classes, 

due to mounting stress of 
being unable to avoid Trevor 
in the workplace. The Daily 
was provided documentation 
of this time off in both cases. 
At the end of the month, 
she 
also 
reached 
out 
to 

OIE to continue with the 
investigation process. 

Richter alleged that she 

also continued to encounter 
Trevor 
outside 
of 
the 

Hopwood 
Room. 
In 
the 

Spring 2019 semester, she 
was working a part-time job 
at Literati Bookstore, which 
frequently 
partners 
with 

Helen Zell for events and 
readings. Richter alleged that 
Trevor continued to try to 
interact with her in the store. 

“(Trevor) 
would 
insert 

himself into places that I 
was, or conversations (I was 
having),” Richter said.

After 
one 
Helen 
Zell-

affiliated 
event 
in 
April 

2019 where Trevor was in 
attendance 
and 
allegedly 

tried to interact with her 
— which a former Literati 
employee 
was 
able 
to 

independently corroborate — 
Richter said she approached 
the owners of Literati with 
her concerns. The owners 
contacted Trevor and asked 
him to no longer visit the 
store, according to Richter.

Two employees of Literati 

in April 2019 confirmed that 

Trevor was asked not to enter 
the store and was added to 
an internal list of banned 
customers around this time 
as a result of complaints from 
Literati staff. The owners 
of Literati did not respond 
to 
multiple 
requests 
for 

comment. 

Richter graduated from the 

University at the end of the 
Spring 2019 semester. The 
OIE investigation of Trevor’s 
conduct did not conclude 
until almost a year after her 
graduation 
in 
the 
Spring 

2020 
semester. 
According 

to Richter, the experience 
and 
ensuing 
reporting 

process consumed more than 
a third of her three-year 
undergraduate career.

“It was really like a full 

year of my life, dealing with 
so much pressure, dealing 
with school, dealing with 
needing to keep multiple jobs 
and doing a thesis and also 
trying to have friends, while 
also being pressured by these 
professors who harassed me,” 
Richter said. “It became my 
whole life, in a really awful 
way, and took away so much 
from that time in my life.”

“It’s changed my life 

forever”

Over the course of 2018, a 

Helen Zell alum and former 
staff member of the program 
alleged 
that 
her 
close, 

occasionally boundary-pushing 
friendship with Trevor quickly 
devolved 
into 
months 
of 

retaliation and attempts to get 
her fired. Trevor stepped down 
as the director of Helen Zell at 
the end of the same year. 

The former staff member 

spoke on the condition of 
anonymity, citing privacy and 
safety concerns. In this article, 
she will be referred to as Kate.

In 
interviews 
with 
The 

Daily, Kate alleged that this 
retaliation 
began 
after 
she 

sent Trevor an angry email 
in January 2018 calling him 
out for what she considered 
“obnoxious” behavior. 

The Daily spoke with three 

individuals familiar with her 
experiences who corroborated 
the 
consistency 
of 
her 

allegations.

“It’s 
changed 
my 
life 

forever,” Kate said. “I’m, like, 
kind of hyper-vigilant now, 
probably forever.”

Kate said she and Trevor 

started as friends. She was 
hired for a staff position in 2016 
after completing her third year 
with Helen Zell and worked 
closely with Trevor, who had 
become director the same year. 
The two had inside jokes, would 
casually text and observed “low 
levels of professionalism.” 

Kate also said Trevor was 

flirtatious with her. She said he 
sent her suggestive messages, 
on multiple occasions sending 
her songs with romantic lyrics 
and calling them “our song.” 
(The 
Daily 
reviewed 
some 

of 
these 
messages 
through 

screenshots provided by Kate.)

Given that they were closer 

in age — Kate said she came to 
the program later than many of 
her peers — and close as friends, 
she said his actions didn’t 
strike her as inappropriate at 
the time, so she didn’t call him 
out then. 

“I can look back now and be 

like, ‘That wasn’t appropriate,’” 
Kate said. “‘He shouldn’t have 
been flirty.’”

Trevor and Kate allegedly 

maintained this close working 
relationship 
and 
friendship 

until January 2018, when Kate 
sent Trevor the angry email, 
frustrated at the fluctuating 
boundaries in their professional 
relationship. 
While 
their 

working relationship survived 
for a few months after that, 
Kate said this marked the end 

of their friendship. 

According to Kate, three 

months later, in April 2018 — the 
same month Richter reported 
Trevor 
to 
OIE 
— 
Trevor 

reported Kate to staff Human 
Resources, also contacting her 
supervisor as well as David 
Porter, 
then-chair 
of 
the 

English Department. He told 
all three that Kate had been 
unprofessional in the January 
2018 email, according to Kate. 

This marked the beginning 

of Trevor’s attempts to “ruin 
my life,” Kate said.

In 
one 
instance, 
Trevor 

accused Kate of encouraging 
Richter to report him to OIE 
because of Kate’s “resentment” 
toward 
him, 
an 
allegation 

Richter and Kate denied to 
The Daily. When Richter’s 
supervisor — who was also 
Kate’s 
supervisor 
— 
asked 

Trevor to delay his move-in to 
the Hopwood Room director’s 
office to help Richter feel 
more comfortable in the April 
2018 email shown earlier and 
printed again below, Trevor 
responded by doubling down 
on his allegation that Kate was 
behind Richter’s OIE report.

“I have reasons to believe that 

my own comportment is being 
misrepresented and that this 
could be tied to the situations 
I endured with (Kate) this past 
semester,” Trevor wrote. “ ... 
I fear that I might be in the 
process (of) being slandered 
due to the resentment of a 
staff member and that staff 
member’s 
relationship 
with 

others.”

Kate 
said 
Trevor’s 

accusations 
against 
her 

continued to escalate from 
there. Trevor also allegedly 
called the police on Kate in the 
Fall 2018 semester after her 
phone had “butt-dialed” him 
multiple times. Kate said she 
received a call from the police, 
telling her they had received a 
complaint from Trevor that she 
was harassing him.

Kate’s 
friend, 
who 

corroborated the consistency 
of this account to The Daily, 
later 
accompanied 
Kate 
to 

the Apple Store. They learned 
the calls Kate claimed were 
unintentional stemmed from 
him having been listed as her 
emergency contact earlier in 
their working relationship, the 
friend and Kate said. Kate said 
she got a new phone because of 
how alarming Trevor’s reaction 
was.

At 
the 
time, 
OIE’s 

investigation 
into 
Trevor’s 

conduct, initiated by Richter’s 
April 2018 complaint, was still 
underway. In October and after 
the phone incident, to evade 
further 
escalation, 
Porter 

and the LSA Dean’s office 
offered 
Kate 
a 
“temporary 

reassignment” 
until 
Trevor 

was no longer director of Helen 
Zell.

By the time Trevor stepped 

down from the directorship 
in December 2018, however, 
the 
experience 
had 
been 

traumatizing 
to 
the 
extent 

that Kate said she chose not to 
return.

“It’s 
stressful 
to 
have 

someone throw grenade after 
grenade at you, even if they 
don’t go off, you know?” Kate 
said. 
“Because 
he 
thinks 

they’re going to go off. Like, he 
wants them to go off.”

A “very clear double 

standard”

With 
Trevor 
as 
director 

of the Helen Zell Writers’ 
Program from 2016 through 
2018, students would have to go 
to him to report their alleged 
conflicts. 
Molly 
Dickinson, 

a former Helen Zell student, 
alleged that Trevor repeatedly 
sided with her professor when 
Dickinson 
went 
to 
Trevor 

with her concerns, resulting 

in Dickinson feeling alienated 
from the program.

Dickinson was a student in 

the Helen Zell Writers’ Program 
from 2015 to 2017. At the 
beginning of her last semester 
in 
the 
program, 
Dickinson 

alleged that Trevor ignored her 
concerns when she brought him 
troubling communication she 
had received from an instructor 
and instead warned her against 
threatening 
the 
educational 

environment. 

(The 
Daily 
contacted 

Dickinson’s 
professor, 
who 

cited Dickinson’s privacy in 
declining to comment.)

Two 
colleagues 
of 

Dickinson’s and one friend 
confirmed to The Daily that 
she shared this story with them 
at the time, as did another 
colleague 
who 
accompanied 

Dickinson 
to 
one 
of 
her 

meetings with Trevor.

In January 2017, Dickinson 

contacted 
a 
professor 
over 

email, informing them that 
she would be absent from class 
one day due to ethical concerns 
with 
a 
course 
assignment. 

Trevor 
became 
involved 

when Dickinson’s instructor 
replied that she had reported 
Dickinson to Trevor for the 
email. The professor initially 
encouraged Dickinson to make 
arrangements with Trevor to 
drop the class. The Daily was 
provided a copy of their email 
exchange, an excerpt of which 
is printed below.

Alarmed 
by 
what 
she 

considered 
an 
“abrasive” 

response from her instructor 
— as well as the obstacle it 
could pose in her ability to 
graduate on time that semester 
— Dickinson had a one-on-one 
meeting with Trevor the next 
day, hopeful her concerns about 
how her instructor responded 
would be heard. 

Dickinson 
remembered 

printing her email exchange 
with the professor to show 
Trevor. She also brought a 
message her professor had 
sent to the rest of the class 
responding to the concerns 
Dickinson 
had 
identified 

without naming her, a copy 
of which was provided to The 
Daily. In the meeting, however, 
Dickinson said Trevor refused 
to look at the materials she’d 
brought.

“Pretty 
quickly 
in 
our 

conversation, I realized that 
he was not really a receptive 
person and not someone who 
was going to be advocating 
for my experience at all,” 
Dickinson said.

Instead, Dickinson claimed 

that Trevor lectured her about 
how her words had made her 
instructor feel unsafe.

“He magnified it into this 

very large and bizarre argument 
about the quality of open 
discussion in the classroom … 
without actually engaging in 
any specific conversation with 
me about the truly abrasive 
words that were written to me,” 
Dickinson said. 

The 
issue 
over 
one 

assignment 
spawned 
into 

additional meetings between 
her and Trevor, Dickinson said. 
Dickinson also alleged that over 
the course of their discussions 
over this conflict, Trevor would 
offer lucrative professional and 
academic opportunities in what 
felt like efforts to appease her, 
then expressed surprise or 
denied he had made the offer 
when she followed up. 

In one instance, Dickinson 

said 
that 
Trevor 
offered 

to 
arrange 
a 
workshop 

between her and one of the 
program’s high-profile visiting 
writers 
from 
the 
popular 

Zell Visiting Writer Series. 
Dickinson said this offer was 
especially appealing, given the 
complications she experienced 
in her coursework that semester 
due to the unresolved issue with 
the professor. However, when 
she followed up, Dickinson 

said Trevor did not follow 

through on that offer.

“When I actually turned 

around and asked for that, 
he just thought it was mind-
boggling that I would think 
to 
make 
such 
a 
request,” 

Dickinson said.

Kate, 
who 
was 
in 
her 

administrative 
position 
at 

the 
time, 
corroborated 
the 

consistency of this allegation.

Dickinson said the alleged 

lack of support from Trevor 
and the ensuing complications 
in her path to graduation took 
a toll on her mental health. 
She also said that it resulted 
in feelings of social alienation 
from the program as a whole.

“I 
very 
much 
retreated 

from the MFA community,” 
Dickinson 
said. 
“From 

everything, really.”

Because 
Dickinson 
said 

her concerns were repeatedly 
dismissed 
in 
subsequent 

meetings with Trevor, she said 
the experience illustrated for 
her the ways in which Trevor’s 
rules of professionalism applied 
differently to students than 
they did to faculty.

“There seems to be this very, 

very clear double standard of: 
‘We can be personal and fun and 
intimate when I say it’s okay,’” 
Dickinson said. “‘But when you 
unknowingly 
do 
something 

that I don’t agree with, then we 
pull down the jail.’”

“Their hands are often tied”

The women who shared their 

accounts said it wasn’t just 
Trevor’s alleged behavior that 
was at the crux of their negative 
experiences. 
Rather, 
they 

contended that the University’s 
reporting 
mechanisms 
were 

not prepared to handle their 
cases in a way that protects 
vulnerable parties from the 
actions of tenured faculty.

OIE 
has 
consistently 

been criticized for its time-
consuming 
investigation 

processes. In both Richter’s 
and Kate’s experiences, they 
said 
Trevor 
continued 
and 

escalated his behavior while 
the OIE investigation was in 
progress.

“The way time works at the 

University is different from how 
it works for individual people,” 
Kate said. “It’s really easy for 
the University to just outwait 
(complainants). … Things take 
a month, two months, three 
months, you know — people 
get tired. People get distracted. 
They move on.”

For Richter and Kate, as they 

waited for the OIE investigation 
to close, their best option to 
avoid Trevor was temporarily 
leaving their jobs altogether.

Former students, including 

Dickinson, who experienced 
conflict related to Trevor’s 
Helen Zell directorship told 
The 
Daily 
their 
negative 

experiences 
with 
him 
also 

drove them away from the 
program. 

Richter, Kate and Dickinson 

each shared that they did, on the 
other hand, feel supported by 
individual English Department 
administrators in the process. 
They 
stressed 
that 
the 

English Department took the 
allegations seriously, but that 
departmental 
administrators’ 

ability to intervene on students’ 
and staff member’s behalf was 
limited.

“A thing that I really was 

struck by in my experience 
there was how intensely their 
hands are often tied,” Kate 
said. “It’s not the kind of thing 
where, you know, a few people 
can be like, ‘This is messed up. 

Get rid of this person.’ That’s 
just not how the University 
works. Maybe it should be. But 
that’s not how it’s structured.”

When asked what options 

are at a student’s disposal if 
they do not feel comfortable 
reporting to a program director 
or 
administrator, 
Fitzgerald 

responded with other routes a 
student may take depending on 
the nature of the complaint in 
a follow-up email to The Daily. 
Options include reporting to 
a department chair, the dean’s 
office of a particular college 
or OIE. Fitzgerald emphasized 
that OIE investigates issues 
“beyond sexual misconduct,” 
such as discrimination based on 
race, national origin, disability 
and religion.

In an email to The Daily, 

Porter, 
the 
former 
English 

Department Chair during the 
time of the three allegations 
reported in this article, provided 
the 
English 
Department’s 

specific mediation protocols, 
specifying 
the 
roles 
that 

departmental officers are and 
are not advised to play. He also 
commented on the distinction 
between OIE’s and specific 
department’s 
responsibilities 

when a complaint is under 
investigation. 

“Once a formal complaint 

has been lodged with OIE, 
the expectation is that OIE 
takes on full responsibility 
for 
investigating 
the 

complaint,” 
Porter 
wrote. 

“While department leadership 
is 
expected 
to 
establish 

and 
reinforce 
expectations 

for 
respectful 
workplace 

behavior and to offer support 
to 
department 
members 

who 
report 
problematic 

experiences, 
decisions 

concerning consequences for 
violations are entirely in the 
hands of the college deans.”

In Curzan’s own letter of 

reprimand 
for 
Trevor, 
she 

alluded to OIE’s findings before 
writing that she nonetheless 
found his behavior “troubling.” 
She added that his alleged 
retaliation posed concerns for 
the departmental climate.

“Research 
shows 
that 

workplaces where retaliation 
occurs 
can 
foster 
sexual 

harassment because fear of 
reprisal 
limits 
reporting,” 

Curzan wrote. “This is not a 
culture or climate that any of 
us want to have in LSA.”

Richter 
emphasized 
that, 

ultimately, this becomes an 
issue of not only individual 
student’s 
experiences, 
but 

also of diversity, equity and 
inclusion at the University.

“If I hadn’t been a young 

woman in that employment 
environment 
… 
I 
wouldn’t 

have experienced what I did,” 
Richter said. “It’s not just 
like: Bring those people to the 
room. It’s like: How do you 
treat them when they’re there? 
And if they’re treated like that, 
they’re not going to want to be 
there.”

Artist Profile: SMTD 
senior Addison Tharp 

digitizes jazz 

Innovation in the performance 

community is not a new phenom-
enon during the COVID-19 pan-
demic, but what about here on 
campus? The School of Music, 
Theatre & Dance has a whole host 
of performers who have not stood 
by and waited for the pandemic to 
pass, and SMTD senior Addison 
Tharp is no exception. 

As a jazz studies major, Tharp 

has faced the challenges of remote 
music production head-on as he 
navigates the new digital world of 
music production. “As a musician, 
you have to sort of adapt to the 
lifestyle because obviously, I don’t 
have any gigs or performances or 
anything like that anymore,” Tharp 
recently told The Daily in a virtual 
interview.

Despite the challenges that have 

been presented to him, Tharp has 
been working on multiple projects 
this semester. Although a trumpet 
player by training, he also plays 
piano, composes and writes music 
whenever he can. 

Tharp’s most recent endeavor 

was a virtual big band piece en-
titled “Awakening,” performed by 
Tharp himself alongside a small 
group of musicians. Tharp com-
posed, produced and performed 
the piece along with his peers — 
the total process took four months 
to complete. 

When recalling the making of 

“Awakening,” Tharp describes the 
process as an interesting and dif-
ficult one, especially for a jazz mu-
sician. When a jazz ensemble per-

HADLEY SAMARCO

Daily Arts Writer

forms or records live, it is common 
for the musicians to rely heavily on 
improvisation instead of strictly 
following the written music. How-
ever, when virtual, this natural flow 
between players is near impossible 
to replicate when the perform-
ers cannot hear and react to each 
other — instead of the usual spon-
taneity of someone taking the lead, 
the parts have to be organized and 
planned out more than they would 
in a typical jazz performance.

“It requires listening, being all 

there together, reacting to every-
body playing,” Tharp said. “That’s 
the one downside to this format, is 
that you can’t really do that.” 

Each part of Tharp’s piece was 

recorded individually and then lay-
ered together one by one instead 
of the traditional group recording 
style.

This was a new experience for 

Tharp, who had no exposure to 
recording in this kind of digitized 
way, with its lengthy process and 
discombobulated parts. However, 
the experience offered Tharp the 
opportunity to learn new skills 
mixing and arranging pieces of 
music digitally. 

“It was just a lot more focused 

in terms of having to record every-
thing, whether that was soloing or 
just the written parts,” Tharp said, 
revealing a consolatory advantage 
of remote production.

Although it was months in the 

making, Tharp’s song was finally 
completed on Nov. 27, 2020, and 
can be streamed now. 

When asked about the inspira-

tion for the piece, Tharp replied, 
“Basically, the overlying message 
of the chart is like, trying to find 

beauty with all the stuff that’s go-
ing on right now. Trying to find 
beauty in things as simple as hear-
ing the birds sing or something 
along those lines.” 

His words, as well as his music, 

strike a common chord — beauty 
is something the world is sorely in 
need of right now more than ever.

Tharp championed “Awaken-

ing” as one of his more complex 
pieces of work, and the lyrics were 
personal to him: “I used it as sort of 
like a way to cope with the initial 
shock of COVID. Because that was 
like, one of the first things that I did 
over the summer was start writing 
this tune.” 

It has been a difficult year for 

many, and Tharp’s story is not an 
unfamiliar one. Seeing the beauty 
and art that has bloomed out of 
hardship is inspiring and heart-
warming.

With this piece finished and be-

hind him, Tharp has more time to 
focus on his long-term project, a 
five-to-six-song EP he has been ex-
perimenting with. With one song 
finished and another on the way, 
he is branching out from his acous-
tic roots and delving into electronic 
music, resulting in something akin 
to a mixture of Anomalie and Rob-
ert Glasper.

Excited for what comes next, 

Tharp is ready to take his new 
skills with him into his career post-
graduation. “It’s adding a whole 
new dimension to (my) creative 
ability.” 

Although it hasn’t been perfect 

by any means, Tharp’s work is 
proof that jazz performance has 
persevered.

The gap between semesters is 

always a perfect time to catch up on 
the movies I was too busy to watch 
during the school year. Yet, return-
ing home also gives me a chance to 
access the countless DVDs that my 
family has bought and kept over the 
years. So every winter break, I face 
a dilemma: Watch the latest films 
in order to get in on the conversa-
tion, or gravitate toward the old 
favorites? The answer, of course, 
is both. But while I finally got 
around to seeing Film Beat favor-
ites like “Emma,” “Never Rarely 
Sometimes Always” and “Sound of 
Metal,” it was the old favorites that 
I enjoyed the most.

After the time I’ve spent on the 

Film Beat, it’s certainly a little 
weird to watch films that I’ve loved 
for most of my life and learn that 
they have low Rotten Tomatoes 
scores and divisive critical reviews. 
With old favorites, though, that’s 
not what’s important; it’s more 
valuable to focus on how much I 
enjoy watching these movies, even 
though I have seen them countless 
times and can quote nearly all of 
the lines. 

The National Treasure series 

may have a critical rating that is 
thirty percent lower than the audi-
ence rating, but I will never get 
tired of watching Ben (Nicholas 
Cage, “Face/Off”), Abigail (Diane 
Kruger, “Inglourious Basterds”) 
and Riley (Justin Bartha, “The 
Hangover”) run around historical 
landmarks on improbable treasure 
hunts. With movies like the Chron-

icles of Narnia film series, I’ve 
decided that it’s less about whether 
the films follow C.S. Lewis’s books 
perfectly and more about how they 
bring the world to life in such a 
lovely way. And sure, “Night At 
The Museum: Battle of the Smith-
sonian” is not quite the epitome 
of comedy that I once thought it 
was, but it makes me laugh, and 
my sister and I have been parrot-
ing Kahmunrah’s (Hank Azaria, 
“The Simpsons”) utterly quot-
able lines to each other for over a 
decade. These movies come with 
the perfect kind of caveat, fueled 
by a nostalgic bias: They may not 
be perfect, but I love them anyway.

I simply don’t know how I went 

so long without watching “Jen-
nifer’s Body.” Since I, like many 
others, had nothing going on over 
break, I decided it was finally time 
to see what this acclaimed movie 
was all about.

For those who haven’t seen it, 

“Jennifer’s Body” follows pos-
sessed teen Jennifer (Megan Fox, 
“Rogue”) who hunts down and 
kills her male classmates, as her 
best friend Needy (Amanda Sey-
fried, “Mank”) tries to stop her. 
Yeah. It’s crazy. Going into it, I was 
excited because I love Diablo Cody 
(“Juno”), and I know that this film 
is regarded as a cult classic.

But what I was not expecting 

was the hard-hitting social com-
mentary. I don’t know if I was 
taking it too seriously, but I feel so 
passionately about the themes of 
sexual violence and toxic mascu-
linity that make up this story. Obvi-

ously, it has an iconic script, with 
lines like “He looked like lasagna 
with teeth” and “You’re lime green 
jello and you can’t even admit it to 
yourself” being some of my favor-
ites. 

But when I wasn’t laughing, a lot 

of this movie made me so sad. The 
reason that Jennifer is possessed in 
the first place is because an indie 
rock band uses her as a “virgin 
sacrifice” to Satan in exchange for 
fame and wealth. However, Jen-
nifer was not actually a virgin, so 
she is perpetually possessed in the 
movie. Most unfortunately, if that 
isn’t a metaphor for how sexual 
assault can traumatize someone 
or monumentally change their life, 
then I don’t know what is.

I see myself watching this movie 

many times more, but I’m glad that 
the first time I watched it was over 
break. A well-written, clever, at 
times heartbreaking and (dare I 

say) genius film is just what I need-
ed to end 2020 with.

Sometimes I feel like I’d be a 

great test subject for an anthropo-
logical study on the amount of time 
Gen Z’ers spend in front of screens. 
Some graduate student could write 
about how the strong economic 
growth of the ’90s influenced my 
parents, originally from working-
class families, to start a large bour-
geois family. Or perhaps they could 
write something about how the 
economic downturn of the aughts 
meant we couldn’t always afford 
great childcare, but they could sit 
us down in front of some video 
games or a computer or a TV to 
shut us up for eight hours. When-
ever I’m with my family over win-
ter breaks, we tend to blow through 
a lot of new and revisited media, so 
let me break it down.

The good stuff is easy to talk 

about, since they were the films I 
revisited with my siblings for the 
comfort of familiarity:

It’s no secret that “1917” is a 

masterpiece. The score by Thomas 
Newman (“Skyfall”), the cinema-
tography by Roger Deakins (“Blade 
Runner 2049”) and the exhausting, 
relentless performance by George 
Mackay 
(“Captain 
Fantastic”) 

make me want to read T.S. Eliot 
and Virginia Woolf or whoever had 
anything to say about World War I. 
A few of my friends brushed it off 
as just another movie full of white 
guys, but I genuinely think there’s a 
place for films like this that explore 
masculinity so deeply. 

When I watched “1917” in 

theaters last year, I saw a young 
boy, his (assumed) father and his 
grandfather seeing the film togeth-
er. Observing that family, and then 
seeing how Blake (Dean-Charles 
Chapman, “Game of Thrones”) 
spoke about his brother and moth-
er and how Schofield (Mackay) 
interacted with the infant and 
stared at the photo of his wife 
and children resonated with me. 
I think we should talk about why 
male strength is so often repre-
sented through war, and why gen-
erations later men still hold such an 
attachment to these stories — just 
as director Sam Mendes (“Skyfall”) 
clearly does in his adaptation of his 
grandfather’s firsthand accounts 
of the war. 

And, obviously, all those one-

shots. I mean, how can you not 
appreciate the work put into them?

Additionally, 
“My 
Neighbor 

Totoro” is Hayao Miyazaki at his 

finest. This film is a comforting 
and stunning story about children 
told in a completely non-conde-
scending way. I could try to explain 
it, but it’d be better if you just watch 
it and see what I mean. 

I watched some bad stuff too, 

though:

“Spree” was a heavy-handed 

attempt at social critique but, at the 
same time, I always love a chance 
to see Kyle Mooney (“Saturday 
Night Live”) in anything. That’s all 
I have to say about that. 

“Wonder Woman 1984” was 

horse-tranquilizer-to-the-face 
levels of boring, but Pedro Pascal 
(“The Mandalorian”) seemed like 
he was having fun, particularly 
during a climax that my siblings 
and I struggled to hear over our 
own slightly mean-spirited laugh-
ter. Kristen Wiig (“Bridesmaids”) 
seemed lost — or maybe on auto-
pilot — and it just made me want 
to see her in something like “The 
Skeleton Twins” again. 

Anything I could say about the 

film’s imperialist undertones or 
nauseating nostalgia for the 80s 
has already been said, so I’ll just 
say I absolutely could not believe 
that they thought I cared enough to 
watch two and a half hours of this 
garbage. And this is coming from 
someone who actually really liked 
the first movie! I guess my closing 
thought is: “Imagine all the people 
…”

My 

What the Film Beat Watched Over Break

‘Bridgerton’ proves there’s 
nothing like a good period piece

Netflix’s 
period 
drama 

“Bridgerton” 
has 
taken 
the 

world by storm, and with good 
reason. You don’t have to be a 
fan of period pieces to see how 
the series immerses viewers in 
a riveting universe while also 
confronting relevant issues in 
our modern world. “Bridgerton” 
proves my long-held belief that 
period pieces are among the top 
tier of television, when they are 
done right.

With the vast amount of new 

television series coming out 
these days, I’m faced with a dif-
ficult question to tackle: What 
exactly makes a series “good” 
when the range of available 
content is so extensive? Amid 
a broad variety of genres, sub-
ject matter and creative per-
spectives, what is the common 
thread that runs through every-
thing worth watching?

“Bridgerton,” 
and 
period 

pieces at large, can be our case 
study to answer these questions. 
For one, good TV ought to pro-
vide a mode for escapism.

The beauty of period dramas 

is that there is escapism inher-
ent within the genre because 
the whole concept is based on 
another time period. “Bridger-
ton” is set in 1813 London and 
revolves around aristocratic life, 
particularly that of several fami-
lies with children of marrying 
age. “Bridgerton” finds the per-
fect opportunity for escapism 
by walking the line between the 
reality of the time period and 
extravagant fantasy, through 
using striking costume design 

that defined the Georgian peri-
od. Beyond costume design, the 
bright, vibrant cinematography 
and editing style mean that, 
while the show may be set in a 
society with an abundance of 
rigid and boring rules, it’s also 
visually 
striking 
throughout, 

immersing viewers in a world 
far, far away from their living 
rooms.

Escapism is also achieved 

through 
emotion. 
Nothing 

makes you forget the problems 
of the real world like taking on 
the problems of fictional char-
acters and resonating with their 
experiences.

This is easily done through 

period pieces because the set-
ting in a different time period 
implies that there’s going to 
be a different set of values and 
standards of success. Because 
this world is so different, view-
ers can easily decipher what it 
means to succeed while main-
taining a degree of emotional 
separation from their own lives. 
In “Bridgerton,” success comes 
through 
maintaining 
wealth 

and status within aristocratic 
society, which requires adher-
ence to a strict, repressive set of 
social rules.

For Daphne (Phoebe Dynevor, 

“Younger”), the protagonist and 
eldest daughter of the Bridger-
ton family, this means marrying 
well so that her younger sis-
ters can benefit from the status 
she achieves. As the show pro-
gresses, Daphne’s understand-
ing of success begins to include 
her desire for love. Escapism is 
provided by how much we can 
empathize with Daphne and 
how we can understand the ten-
sion between wanting to take 

care of our families while also 
seeking our own personal hap-
piness. The passionate relation-
ship between Daphne and the 
Duke of Hastings (Regé-Jean 
Page, “Sylvie’s Love”) is thought-
fully built, and it feels real. This 
passion also leads to an absurd 
amount of sex scenes — which 
is another form of escapism, if 
you’re into that.

It’s clear that escapism is 

rooted in our ability to empa-
thize with the problems of the 
characters in the show. “Bridg-
erton” not only creates a vibrant 
world but a world whose prob-
lems we can easily adopt every 
episode. This notion isn’t exclu-
sive to period pieces, obviously, 
but I think period pieces do it 
better because the distinctive 
rules and values make the emo-
tional struggles of its characters 
more blatant.

However, escapism alone isn’t 

quite enough to merit a series’s 
quality. At the end of the day, the 
problems have to mean some-
thing, otherwise we wouldn’t 
actually care. There are definite-
ly shows that provide escapism 
for escapism’s sake, but in order 
for a show to be meaningful and 
have longevity, there ought to be 
context and relevance behind 
the problems the characters 
face. Ultimately, there needs to 
be a message that connects the 
show back to our current reality. 
This is easily achieved in period 
pieces because, while they may 
take place in a different time 
period, they still exist within 
our own universe.

I waited a few days after watch-

ing “Pieces of a Woman” to write 
about it. I wasn’t even sure if I was 
going to be able to write anything 
more about it than the non sequi-
turs I’d typed into the notes app on 
my phone: “milk but no baby,” “spit-
ting out an appleseed,” “unfinished 
bridge.” I wasn’t sure if I wanted 
to get in the middle of the cultural 
conversation about the death of the 
artist, delve into the twisted feel-
ing in my stomach when watching 
Sean, the male lead played by Shia 
Labeouf (“Honey Boy”), eerily mir-
roring the addiction and abuse that 
his actor has been accused of. I 
wasn’t sure if it was even right for 
me to criticize a film about mother-
hood when I don’t know the first 
thing about it.

Of course, it’s my job. In Mar-

tin Scorsese’s 2021 documentary 
“Pretend It’s a City,” essayist Fran 
Lebowitz says that a story “is not 
supposed to be a mirror — it’s sup-
posed to be a door.” But “Pieces of a 
Woman” feels so gripping that I felt 

deeply connected to the story, al-
though it’s not one I’ve experienced 
firsthand. 

The extended one-shots mean-

dering through tense scenes forc-
ibly immerse the viewer into the 
lives of the two mothers at its cen-
ter, Martha (Vanessa Kirby, “The 
Crown”) and Elizabeth (Ellen 
Burstyn, “Alice Doesn’t Live Here 
Anymore”). Director Kornél Mun-
druczó (“White God”) invites you 
through the door of the story and 
into a hall of mirrors, simultane-
ously leading you through his own 
creation while connecting you to 
the universal experiences of joy, 
pain, suffering and kinship. That’s 
the paradox here: To offer up Leb-
owitz’s narrative doors to others, 
someone somewhere along the line 
has to stare at themselves in the 
mirror and write down this story 
that may have previously spent a lot 
of time behind locked doors.

If I’m going to double down on this 

door/mirror metaphor, stories about 
motherhood have generally been 
hidden behind a slightly translucent 
door in your grandmother’s bath-
room. When you’re taking a shower 

to get the smell of your grandmoth-
er’s perfume out of your hair, the 
glass fogs up and you can only see the 
other side if you open the door. But 
if you wipe away the condensation, 
you can see yourself — see the finger-
prints and smears from when your 
mother and your mother’s mother 
have looked themselves in the face in 
the same spot that you’re standing in 
just then. “Pieces of a Woman” isn’t 
necessarily doing revolutionary work 
by portraying the realities of mother-
hood, but it is pulling back the cur-
tains on ideas that we maybe didn’t 
realize we were so naive about.

Obviously, everyone has a moth-

er, even if they’re not directly in 
your life. You’d think that after all 
this time, after all the Mary Karr 
poems and “Lady Bird” viewings, 
we’d have exhausted the vat of sto-
ries about mothers and daughters. 

But “Pieces of a Woman” works 

best when it’s lingering on the uni-
versality within the specific. We’ve 
all heard stories about the excru-
ciating pain of childbirth and un-
bearable anxiety felt by first-time 
parents, but Mundruczó dives into 
the often overlooked parts of that 
experience: 
the 
embarrassment 

of waddling around with no pants 
like Winnie the Pooh after Mar-
tha’s water breaks, the incessant 
burping that comes from the rise in 
progesterone during labor, the dia-
pers Martha has to wear when the 
physical trauma of childbirth affects 
her bladder control, the involuntary 
lactation in the middle of a public 
place. You’d think the observation of 
normal bodily functions would get 
old after a while (and at times the 
film does fall prey to some cliches 
of American drama like quivering 
lower lips or ham-fisted metaphors), 
but it’s still illuminating.

Lesbian love in indie pop

Love, and feelings of any 

kind really, have always exist-
ed very close to the surface for 
me. They tend to be the main 
force in my life, something I 
find reflected in music. Pierc-
ing emotions are what drive 
a tune — what music was cre-
ated as an outlet for. This is 
why, one night recently, some-
thing about girl in red’s music 
struck me, and began to bother 
me. It felt synthetic, made like 
a puzzle piece to fit a waiting 
niche of consumers. And then 
I looked around and realized, 
it wasn’t just her. There was a 
whole movement.

As a pansexual woman, it’s 

really great to see more repre-
sentation for women-loving-
women (wlw) in mainstream 

media, especially in danceable 
songs. But I must admit, I have 
a love-hate relationship with 
what I’ve started to refer to 
as “plastic lesbian pop.” This 
is pretty much what it sounds 
like: indie pop female artists 
who often sing romantically 
about other women in a way 
that feels monetized — and, 
as such, inauthentic — such as 
Clairo, King Princess, girl in 
red and Hayley Kiyoko. 

On the one hand, I’ve always 

been a huge fan of natural 
LGBQ+ representation such as 
the songs of these artists where 
the love itself is the focus, not 
as much the struggle of being 
gay (although, of course, that’s 
vital to see represented too), 
as this normalizes the LGBQ+ 
experience. These songs don’t 
scream “I’m gay,” but say it 
slowly and steadily, without 
any sort of nervous rush, tell-
ing us that the song is about a 
woman in the same casual tone 
that they would use were it 
about a man. This simple teen-
age pop tells an easy, gay love 
story — maybe just a highly-
edited version of one.

However, a lot of the time 

it feels like the record execu-
tives said to themselves: “Oh, 
the kids think it’s cool to be 
gay? Ok, let’s give them that 
and make lots of money off of 
them.” As such, a lot of this 
wlw music feels disingenuous, 
like it was made to capitalize 
off of peoples’ love, hypocriti-
cally monetizing that which, 
not too many years ago, a lot 
of people struggled to accept. 
So, while I am really pleased to 
see parts of the LGBTQ+ com-
munity be accepted and nor-
malized by being put into the 
mainstream, I hold a place for 
anger against this music and 
its rote, churned-out feeling.

Overall, I struggle with the 

fact that capitalism turns rep-
resentation into a much more 
formulaic thing. When listen-
ing to this music, it makes me 
question if there is a way for 
the gay experience to exist 
widely and successfully in me-
dia without feeling like a tool 
being used for profit — like a 
box to be checked off or like 
there are defined pathways for 
how to be gay. 

Boiling it down to just one 

way of existing as a queer per-
son, as this plastic lesbian pop 
does, spoonfeeds this gayness 
to the rest of a world in a way 
that does not break its bound-
aries, and thus does not allow 
for full expression and rep-
resentation. This pop lesbian 
aesthetic is a clearly marked 
path on how to be a cool wlw 
that still fits into straight peo-
ple’s comfort zones. This is 
accentuated by the fact that 
this aesthetic is very present 
on TikTok, where the app and 
its users assign it a designated 
place in the gayness of things. 
Artists such as Clairo have also 
been taken over by “straight” 
TikTok, with not a lot of care 
being paid to the sapphic lyr-
ics.

The emotional vulnerability 

seems manufactured, the gay 
experience exploited; not by 
these artists, necessarily, but 
by the capitalist culture that 
consumes their work. It is im-
portant to note that the cre-
ators of the music themselves 
are gay, and are sharing their 
experiences and profiting from 
this as well. However, part of 
this trend of boppy, formulai-
cally representative music is 
that straight people easily ab-
sorb this pop media without 
paying attention to the strug-
gle it took for these gay artists 
to get here, and will move on 

to the next trend when this one 
is over. 

Trends are the essence of 

pop culture, so it is inevitable 
that anything that is part of it 
will eventually pass. The les-
bian/bisexual 
woman 
iden-

tity, bursting onto the scene in 
this particular manner, seems 
to follow these hallmarks of a 
social media event, enshrined 
on TikTok, that will eventually 
fade into the next craze. How-
ever, the straight relationship 
has existed as a trusty constant 
through 
pop 
culture. 
Why 

can’t the LGBTQ+ identity ex-
ist in the same way?

What it comes down to is 

that this music is widespread 
enough to almost be a genre. 
It is one of the few gay expe-
riences widely accepted — one 
sung in somewhat generic 
chords, by attractive, mostly 
white young women — and 
does not capture the full won-
der of the LGBTQ+ communi-
ty. The beauty of the commu-
nity lies in the fact that there is 
no one way to define “queer” — 
queer arises as a blanket term 
because there are so many dif-
ferent sexualities and gender 
identities that each individual 
interacts with in their own 
way and on their own terms. 
For some, it is a central part of 
their identity, something they 
feel compelled to discuss, or 
else they feel they are not be-
ing true to themselves. For 
some, it is a casual, factual 
part of life that they will only 
bring up if asked. For some, it 
is a hidden, denied portion of 
themselves.

It is difficult to give an exact 

answer to my aforementioned 
question of how to properly 
represent the gay identity in 
the mainstream in a way that 
doesn’t feel boxed in. This is 
because an opinion coming 
from just one person could 
never have a hope of answer-
ing for all members of the LG-
BTQ+ community. Sometimes, 
it is more important that these 
questions are asked than an-
swered, so that more people 
may consider them. The beau-
ty of the LGBTQ+ community 
is that there are so many dif-
ferent voices and experiences 
to be celebrated and felt. This 
plastic lesbian pop reduces 
the community down to a sin-
gle kind of voice, one seraphic 
and sapphic, sure, but one 
kind all the same. This allows 
straight people to comfortably 
feel as though this makes for 
enough representation, and 
proceed to wash their hands 
of the matter. If a gay person 
complains, 
this 
music 
be-

comes just another example 
they can point to, giving the 
LGBTQ+ community another 
token.

While 
writing 
this, 
my 

thought 
process 
ran 
into 

many different walls, mak-
ing me turn back around and 
reconsider constantly. I think 
this attitude of consistently 
considering and asking ques-
tions is important in matters 
of representation; new voices 
emerge all the time from all 
different kinds of identities, 
and to give one answer to all 
of these would never work. 
This plastic lesbian pop is a 
gift in that it makes me cel-
ebrate how far representation 
has come because this is pop-
ular at all, yet also makes me 
think about how much further 
it has to go. After all, there is 
time, when thinking critically 
about music such as this, to 
smile at the joy and inclusion 
it does inspire with its docu-
mentation of lesbian relation-
ships, and dance a little.

S

hould annual reports be 
published annually? For the 
University 
of 
Michigan’s 

Office of Institutional Equity, this is 
apparently a difficult question. OIE, 
the office that handles investigations 
of sexual misconduct within the 
University, 
estimates 
that 
their 

annual report for the fiscal year that 
ended on June 30 will be ready in 
mid-January 2021. The last report 
was published on Nov. 11, 2019. 

Spokesman 
Rick 
Fitzgerald 

attributed the delay to the “new 
umbrella policy” (effective Aug. 14, 
2020) and “other matters (that) were a 
higher priority.” The umbrella policy is 
the University’s policy for addressing 
sexual and gender-based misconduct. 
It applies to the University’s Ann 
Arbor, Flint and Dearborn campuses 
and 
encompasses 
faculty, 
staff, 

students and third parties. 

Granted, timeliness has never 

been OIE’s strong suit, nor has 
transparency, a fact acknowledged 
recently by Regent Denise Ilitch (D). 
Transparency is a priority in a year 
marked by multiple high-profile 
instances of the University utterly 
failing to address sexual misconduct 
and then further marred by distrust 
from faculty, students and staff. 
These annual reports are supposed 
to provide some measure of clarity, 
as previously indicated by Fitzgerald. 
It is simply unacceptable that the 
University of Michigan community 
will go at least 14 months without any 
measure of accountability from OIE. 

OIE has a tendency to be sporadic 

with their annual reports. They have 
been published in September (2018), 
October (2016) November (2014, 2019) 
and January (2016). Multiple calendar 
years have elapsed without an annual 

report, so this is not a problem that 
can be chalked up to any one year’s 
increased 
responsibilities. 
It 
is 

important to note that OIE estimates 
that their next report will be ready in 
January — there is not a hard release 
date. As a student at this institution, I 
would be expected to communicate 
with my professors if I were to turn in 
a paper a day late, let alone give myself 
a five-month cushion. 

For 
comparison’s 
sake, 
the 

University’s Annual Fire and Safety 
Report is published every single year 
at the beginning of October. This year, 
they have been given an extension, a 
date clearly noted on the front page of 
their website. 

Another 2020 shocker — OIE is late on something

JESSIE MITCHELL | COLUMNIST

I

n September, Ann Arbor City 
Councilmember 
Elizabeth 

Nelson presented the idea 

that the University of Michigan 
open vacant campus housing to 
Ann Arbor’s homeless population. 
Shelters in Ann Arbor lack the space 
to adequately house the homeless, 
but on-campus housing will only 
house up to 3,000 students for the 
winter 2021 semester, leaving plenty 
of empty rooms. 

Many in Ann Arbor support 

Nelson’s proposal, but others are 
skeptical. 
Comments 
in 
some 

University 
of 
Michigan 
parent 

Facebook groups reflect frustration 
toward the situation: Why will the 
University house the homeless in 
dorms for free when students, who 
were willing to pay full price, were not 
given the opportunity to live there? 
Though the frustration is warranted, 
it does not overshadow the argument 
for housing the homeless population 
in University of Michigan dorms. 
Using vacant on-campus housing 
to house the homeless promotes 
public health in Ann Arbor, balances 
the University’s contribution to 
the increase in Ann Arbor housing 
prices and reflects positively on the 
University’s commitment to the 
surrounding community. 

Providing the homeless population 

with 
stable 
housing 
options 

minimizes their risk of exposure to 
COVID-19, therefore minimizing 
the risk of everyone in Ann Arbor. 
Homeless people are at high-risk of 
contracting COVID-19, as they do 

not have the resources necessary 
to follow many CDC guidelines. 
They do not have shelter in which 
to isolate or quarantine, and social 
distancing often is not an option. The 
homeless experience even greater 
risk in Ann Arbor, given the increase 
in population density during the 
academic year and frequent student 
gatherings that break COVID-19 
guidelines. 

In providing more of the Ann 

Arbor homeless population with 
housing stability, we give them the 
necessary resources to better adhere 
to CDC guidelines, minimizing their 
own risk of contracting COVID-19 
and, as a result, the whole of Ann 
Arbor’s risk. 

We cannot discuss homelessness 

in Ann Arbor, though, without 
discussing the University’s role in it. 
The University of Michigan has an 
enrollment of approximately 48,000 
students, many of whom reside in off-
campus housing. This large demand 
for housing in Ann Arbor results in 
an increase in housing prices, making 
it unaffordable for many Ann Arbor 
residents. Ann Arbor real estate has 
appreciated by 67.85% since 2000, 
while that of the state of Michigan 
has appreciated by only 46.20% since 
2000. While this increase in value 
has made housing expensive for 
many students, it has made housing 
impossible for many residents, and 
many become homeless as a result. 
The University’s presence in Ann 
Arbor is a catalyst for homelessness, 
so it makes sense for the institution to 

help to solve the problem it helped to 
create. 

Still, 
opponents 
to 
Nelson’s 

proposal view the use of University 
dorms as housing for the homeless 
population as unrealistic, unsure of 
how the University will implement 
the plan. They will be relieved to 
know that the University of Michigan 
will not be the first to house homeless 
residents in their vacant dorms. 

Suffolk 
University 
opened 
a 

residence hall to Boston’s homeless 
population in March of 2020. With 
help from a local hotel and the 
Boston Public Health Commission, 
the University was able to offer 172 
rooms to those who needed shelter, 
and the few students in the dormitory 
were relocated. Providing isolated 
spaces to members of the homeless 
population minimized the spread of 
COVID-19 among the community. 

Similarly, 
Sonoma 
State 

University 
opened 
facilities 
to 

the 
Sonoma 
County 
homeless 

population in April of 2020. In 
tandem with Sonoma County, the 
University provided residents with 
food and water, healthcare, and 
access to government benefits. 
The areas in which they lived 
were fenced off in order to allow 
residents to adequately shelter in 
place in accordance with the state’s 
guidelines.

W

hether for a competitive 
match, a networking 
outing with colleagues 

or just to catch up with friends, 
Americans love the game of golf. In 
2017, over 24 million Americans took 
to vast, green stretches of land to drive 
around in a cart and hit a ball with 
a club. While golf courses may look 
pretty on the outside, a deeper look at 
them tells a completely different story. 

Between the valuable fertile land 

that they currently occupy, the billions 
of gallons of water used every day and 
the drastically high use of pesticides, 
golf courses are ecological and health 
disasters. Golf has surpassed its 
expiration date and should go the way 
of the dinosaurs. Americans must put 
environmental and human health 
before pleasure and leisure.

To build a golf course, companies 

must obtain the rights to a large 
chunk of land. In the United States, 
the average size of golf courses 
ranges between 110 and 190 acres. 
For reference, this is larger than the 
world’s smallest country, Vatican City, 
which takes up just over 100 acres. 
According to ESPN, there are more 
than 15,000 golf courses in the U.S. 
This brings the grand total of acreage 
of American golf courses to over two 
million acres — larger than the state of 
Delaware.

The land used for golf courses 

is sometimes located in valuable 
areas situated near oceans or lakes. 
Building golf courses in these places 
takes away from the agricultural 
opportunities that could be used 
to feed local communities. Besides 
occupying potentially fruitful land, 
development of golf courses ravishes 
native ecosystems. Following the 
allocation of the land, all of the 
natural vegetation is cleared to 
allow for the course to be built. All 
of the trees, plants and habitats for 
the animals that lived there are 
wiped out — forcing them to migrate 
into other ecosystems, creating a 
hazardous cycle.

Golf courses also use an incredibly 

large amount of water. According to 
the United States Golf Association, 
water usage from daily golf course 
irrigation totaled 2,312,701 acre-feet 
per year, which equates to an average 
of 2.08 billion gallons of water per day 
between 2003 and 2005. 

In 
comparison, 
an 
Olympic 

swimming pool holds just over 
660,000 gallons of water — this comes 
out to over 3,000 Olympic swimming 
pools of water per day. This immense 
amount of water could be used for 
farming or treated and provided for 
households that do not have access to 
clean running water. 

This issue became increasingly 

relevant during California’s drought 
in 2015. California is home to over 
1,000 golf courses, so when there was 
a lack of water and public officials 
had to decide where to allocate the 
water, the choice should have been 
obvious. California should have shut 
down the golf courses and made sure 
that every resident had access to 
clean drinking water. 

 However, this was not the case. 

As many as two-thirds of Californian 
golf courses stayed open and the 
average 18-hole course continued to 
use 90 million gallons of water each 
day. While Californians all over the 
state were struggling to find clean 
water to drink, cook or clean with, 
golf courses were using enough water 
to fill 136 Olympic-sized swimming 
pools daily. 

Another major health risk posed 

by golf courses comes in the form 
of pesticides. Researchers surveyed 
former golf superintendents and 
found that four types of cancer — 
brain, lymphoma, prostate and large 
intestine — were more common in golf 
superintendents than people working 
elsewhere. 

It’s time to say goodbye to golf

“

No 
exceptions” 
punctuates 

the testing section of Dr. Ron 
Caldwell’s Econ 101 syllabus. 

On four separate occasions in the 
syllabus, “no exceptions” clearly 
informs disabled and chronically 
ill students that their experiences 
won’t be taken into account and 
that they may face discrimination 
or 
infringement 
of 
their 
civil 

rights. While “no exceptions” — a 
clear violation of the Americans 
with Disabilities Act’s reasonable 
accommodations mandate — may 
be glossed over by students without 
disabilities, this ableist rule can be 
the difference between passing and 
failing for students with disabilities or 
chronic illnesses. 

This discriminatory and lazy “no 

exception” rule must be eliminated 
across campus if the University of 
Michigan wants to live up to its mission 
of serving “the people of Michigan 
and the world through preeminence 
in 
creating, 
communicating, 

preserving and applying knowledge, 
art, and academic values, and in 
developing leaders and citizens who 
will challenge the present and enrich 
the future.” A blanket denial of both 
legal and moral obligations to provide 
reasonable accommodations is an 

archaic violation of this mission and 
unfit to exist at the University or any 
academic institution.

For two students I spoke to, Dr. 

Caldwell’s “no exception” policy and 
the subsequent support of the policy 
from the Economics Department 
and the University, barred them 
from being able to succeed in their 
respective situations. A student with 
Spinal Muscular Atrophy Type II 
who, due to privacy protections, will 
be referred to as Peter in this article, 
and Cheyanne Killin, LSA senior and 
former Services for Students with 
Disabilities Student Advisory Board 
chair, were both greatly impeded 
by this policy. Even when a disabled 
student does everything right, these 
“no exception” policies create intense 
barriers and stresses in order to 
simply graduate. 

For Peter, Dr. Caldwell’s “no 

exception” policy resulted in having 
to take an Econ 101 final under 
medical duress, as the final exam 
period overlapped with prep time for 
a necessary and urgent procedure. 
Peter 
submitted 
the 
proper 

documentation at the beginning of 
the semester, including a Services 
for Students with Disabilities (SSD), 
a medical VISA that outlined the 

accommodations 
required 
for 

SMA2, and followed up with the 
professor via email, explaining his 
circumstances. He further invited 
the professor to read about SMA2 
and ask any questions he may have 
about the condition. Had Dr. Caldwell 
done further research, or reached 
out to Peter about his disability, he 
would have discovered that people 
with SMA2 must receive injections 
every four months to prevent further 
muscular atrophy. 

In a letter to University President 

Mark Schlissel and the Economics 
Department, Kathy Homan, president 
of the Washtenaw Association for 
Community Advocacy, wrote that 
“the injection (Peter) receives is called 
SPINRAZA. It’s a lumbar injection 
that can and has generated serious 
side effects for him, the most common 
side effects of SPINRAZA include 
lower respiratory infection, fever … 
vomiting, back pain, and post-lunar 
puncture syndrome … This is the only 
medication that has the promise of 
halting the progression of (Peter)’s 
Spinal Muscular Atrophy Type II.”

As the semester was coming to 

a close, Peter discovered that the 
window to take the Econ 101 final 
overlapped with the prep time 

needed for his injection procedure, 
rescheduled 
due 
to 
COVID-19. 

Within hours he reached out to Dr. 
Caldwell, explaining his situation 
and asking simply that the professor 
open the exam window earlier so that 
he could take the exam. Mind you, 
Peter wasn’t asking for more study 
time, simply asking he be given an 
opportunity to take the exam before 
his procedure. Instead of providing 
this reasonable accommodation, Dr. 
Caldwell stated that he hoped Peter 
would “understand that providing 
alternatives that, as per the syllabus, 
are not available to the rest of the class 
is a bit unfair to the other students.” 

He presented Peter with the option 

of taking the final during the prep 
time of his procedure, under medical 
duress, or a ranked score. Dr. Caldwell 
outlined the alternative in a June 23 
email, saying “Specifically, we rank 
order all students and find where you 
fall among the students for the exam 
that you completed. I.e. say you are 
40 out of 112 (this is just an example). 
Then I take the exam you missed 
(2nd exam in this case), rank order all 
students, and give you the score that 
the 40th individual received.” This 
arbitrary alternative is unreasonable, 
as it failed to provide Peter with an 

opportunity to demonstrate or test his 
knowledge, which is the entire point 
of assessments.

“I really felt like I should’ve had the 

opportunity to show my growth in the 
course,” Peter expressed. “Letting me 
take the test just a few hours earlier 
would’ve made that difference. The 
window encompassed my procedure 
so there was nothing I could do 
about it. It’s not like I was asking for 
anything extraneous, it’s not like 
people were taking it at the same time 
of day, it was an exam window. I don’t 
understand why I couldn’t have had 
an earlier exam window.” 

Naturally, after this disappointing 

and 
disheartening 
experience, 

Peter filed a grade grievance appeal 
through the Economics Department. 
As Peter arrived, via Zoom, at the 
grievance committee hearing, he was 
shocked to find the panel was solely 
made up of colleagues of Dr. Caldwell. 

“There was no specialist, the ADA 

coordinator wasn’t there, no one from 
OIE (Office of Institutional Equity) 
was there, no one from SSD was there, 
no one versed in the ADA was there … 
the professors were referring to Dr. 
Caldwell by nicknames, it all felt very 
out of place,” Peter reflected. 

Cheyanne Killin said that she 

deeply agrees “that this situation 
not only exemplifies the rampant 
ableism present in the University but 
is one of many examples that expose 
the need for major departmental 
and institutional change. Disabled 
students are viewed here as an 
afterthought 
or 
an 
additional 

difficulty, leading to our needs 
not being met and our needing to 
surmount 
intense 
barriers 
and 

stressors, seemingly alone, in order 
to simply graduate. For a University 
that overly prides itself on Diversity, 
Equity, 
and 
Inclusion, 
disabled 

and chronically ill students are, 
most certainly, not receiving those 
sentiments.”

The appeal committee’s lack of 

SSD representation, ADA specialist, 
or medical advocate underscores the 
systemic problems that exist in the 
economics department and beyond. 

“The University should make it 

mandatory,” Homan wrote of the 
situation. “That a certain ratio of 
any committee members making 
decisions related to the disability 
community 
and 
Americans 

with Disabilities Act have expert 
knowledge on both …” Ultimately, 
and surprisingly to Homan, while 
the committee was not in unanimous 
agreement, they “sided with the 
University over (Peter).”

Peter did everything right. He 

went out of his way to communicate 
and provide the right documentation 
to explain his situation to Dr. Caldwell 
prior to the exam, he enlisted the 

support of community advocates like 
Homan to help him following his 
unfair treatment and went through 
the department’s procedure that was 
supposed to remedy these situations. 
The University failed him at every 
step. 

While the evidence of one student 

being crushed by the system should be 
evidence enough to change it, it is also 
important to highlight that Peter is 
not alone. Killin reflected on her past 
with Dr. Caldwell, saying “I actually 
failed a course under the same 
instructor due to an ableist situation.” 
Just like Peter, the “no exception” rule 
in Dr. Caldwell’s class prevented her 
from having the same opportunity 
for success as her non-disabled peers. 
Killin was in the middle of having her 
disability diagnosed when she took 
Econ 101 in 2017. 

As her illness progressed and she 

became too ill to attend classes, she 
was given permission by University 
Health Service for medical absences; 
even with this permission Killin still 
went to her Econ 101 section to turn 
in her bi-weekly quizzes, required to 
be turned in in-person under the “no 
exception” rule. 

“However, 
as 
my 
illness 

progressed, I stopped being able to 
go to the classroom to turn in my 
exams,” Killin noted. “I emailed both 
Professor Caldwell and my GSI about 
this and asked if I could scan in the 
exams to them, even offering to take 
pictures of myself with the completed 
exam to assure my identity. Under the 
‘no exception’ rule, this was denied, 
and I received a full zero for the last 
two quizzes, which caused me to fail 
the course. I retook (the class) the 
next semester, under similar medical 
circumstances, with the only change 
being an accommodating professor, 
and got a B+.” 

Situations like this should not 

exist; disabled and chronically ill 
students should not have to play 
academic 
roulette, 
wondering 

whether the professor teaching 
their course will be accommodating 
or lean on discriminatory “no 
exception” rules like Dr. Caldwell. 
The University can and must remedy 
these infringements on civil rights 
if it wishes to live up to its mission 
statement and Diversity, Equity & 
Inclusion goals.

When The Daily reached out to 

Dr. Caldwell via multiple emails 
for a response on the use of his 
stringent “no exception” policy and its 
relationship to ADA non-compliance, 
he did not respond. 

I

t’s a pretty simple question: 
“Do you condemn white 
supremacy?” But even after 

three public statements, University 
Regent Ron Weiser (R) still has not 
answered it.

Weiser is an elected member of 

the University of Michigan Board 
of Regents and the incoming chair 
of the Michigan Republican Party. 
His incoming co-chair, Meshawn 
Maddock, is a prominent voice in 
the “stop the steal” movement that 
alleges Donald Trump won the 
election, and she helped organize 
busloads of Michiganders to attend 
what became a domestic terrorist 
attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 
6, an attack that was orchestrated 
in part by well-known white 
supremacists carrying Confederate 
flags and covered in neo-Nazi 
tattoos. 

The events of that day were the 

culmination of long-term planning 
from white nationalist groups, 
including the Proud Boys, that 
organized online to take over the 
Capitol not just in opposition to 
the certification of the Electoral 
College vote, but expressly in the 
name of white supremacy. The day 
of the attack, Maddock shared a 
since-removed video of the crowd 
on Instagram, calling the group a 
“sea of Patriots.”

In the video she shared, a man 

off-camera can be heard yelling, 
“We need to march on the Capitol 
when we’re done here and drag 
these people out of power.” Later 
in the day, members of this crowd 
came within minutes of killing 
members of the U.S. Congress and 
Vice President Mike Pence.

The day after the insurrection, 

when directly asked by Bridge 
Magazine about who incited the 
riot and his views about what had 
occurred, Weiser, who has been 
a major donor to the outgoing 

president and even landed on his 
2016 inaugural committee, failed 
to condemn his co-chair Maddock 
or white supremacy. Instead, he 
said that he had not watched the 
attacks or news surrounding it: 
“I watched Michigan destroy 
Minnesota in basketball, and that 
kind of contest is something that I 
strongly support.” He later blamed 
this response on oral surgery he 
received the day of the riots.

Weiser cleaned up his original 

response with a second statement 
saying 
he 
condemned 
“those 

people who turned (a protest) into 
a mob” and that his heart went out 
to those “unnecessarily” harmed. 
Later, in light of a growing number 
of signatories to a Change.org 
petition and an open letter signed 
by faculty, staff and alumni calling 
for his resignation, Weiser offered 
an additional statement that was 
substantively the same as his 
previous one, calling the events 
“incredibly tragic and wrong,” 
without referring to them as a 
terrorist attack or insurrection. At 
each turn, even without the haze 
of oral surgery, he still managed to 
miss the words “I condemn white 
supremacy.”

Apart from Weiser’s shocking 

disregard for the severity of the 
Jan. 6 insurrection, his statements 
are a matter of safety for anyone 
affiliated with the University. Let 
me put it in a broader context: 
Just months after I graduated 
from the University of Virginia as 
an undergraduate student, white 
supremacists descended on my 
former home, terrorizing students 
and, the next day in downtown 
Charlottesville, killing a young 
woman. If, in the immediate 
aftermath of this attack, any 
member of the UVa Board of 
Visitors had equivocated in their 
condemnation of these neo-Nazis, 

they would have been promptly 
shunned by the UVa community 
and rightly stripped of any titles 
or standing. Anything less, and 
the neo-Nazis who had already 
terrorized UVa would have felt 
empowered to come back for more.

That same danger in Michigan 

is very real. According to the 
FBI, armed insurrectionists are 
currently 
planning 
to 
attack 

Michigan’s Capitol, which, as we 
are all too painfully aware, was 
already attacked in April, followed 
by an attempt to kidnap Gov. 
Gretchen Whitmer. In fact, one of 
the men who attacked Michigan’s 
Capitol last spring participated 
in the Jan. 6 insurrection in 
Washington, D.C.

And yet, here at the University, 

even 
after 
three 
separate 

statements, the fact remains that 
Weiser has at no point condemned 
his co-chair, who was complicit 
in a terrorist attack on the U.S., 
or white supremacy itself, an 
abhorrent phenomenon and the 
avowed cause of the terrorists. As 
a result — and at a minimum — he 
must resign.

The stakes here cannot be 

understated. Failing to condemn the 
driving force of this riot will only 
let that force grow stronger. White 
supremacist activity on university 
campuses hit a record high in 2019, 
the most recent year for which 
data is available. Well before white 
supremacists successfully invaded 
the U.S. Capitol, they marched on 
UVa’s grounds carrying torches and 
chanting “Jews will not replace us.” 

In these moments, language 

matters. It is not enough to 
denounce violence by itself and in 
a passive voice. Our regents must 
loudly, explicitly and unequivocally 
stand against white supremacist 
ideology and the terrorist attack it 
wrought. There is simply no room 

to believe that what’s happened on 
other campuses can’t happen on 
ours. 

We cannot give officials three 

or more chances to get their 
condemnations right. The issue 
here is not just a matter of delay 
— it’s the reluctance to denounce 
something as odious as white 
nationalism or domestic terrorism 
at all. Any hedging is disqualifying.

The day Weiser made his 

first statement — deflecting to 
basketball — I, along with many 
others, emailed him demanding 
his resignation. After a handful 
of tense exchanges, I asked him 
point-blank in my latest email, “Do 
you condemn white supremacy?”

He responded that he is 

less powerful than I think — 
despite 
being 
the 
incoming 

chair of a state political party, 
an ambassador under former 
President George W. Bush, a 
significant donor to the current 
president and a member of the 
Board of Regents. He said that 
he has no influence over white 
supremacists, which ignores his 
leverage and responsibility as 
a public figure to prevent their 
normalization. He also said that 
as a Jewish person, he fears white 
supremacists himself.

When The Daily’s Editorial Page 

Editors reached out separately for 
a comment from Weiser, he did not 
respond.

U-M students also feel fear — 

only none of us have the power to 
do anything about it. Any official 
who refuses to readily identify 
and publicly condemn the danger 
of white supremacy only amplifies 
its danger for the rest of us.

T

here is a riot at the United 
States Capitol, but you happen 
to be in Miami, Florida on 

vacation. When choosing to post 
either a beach picture or an educative 
update of the insurrection, is it not 
obvious what is more important to 
share with your followers on social 
media? 

To “be political” has recently 

become a certain personality type. 
When some people choose to be 
apolitical, however, they choose 
to not involve themselves in the 
dialogues that occur on online 
platforms. There are two types of 
people who choose not to engage 
in those discussions on social 
media. The first know they are not 
invested in social media and don’t 
feel that posting anything will make 
a change in the world, but they may 
know they made a more important 
change at the polls earlier this year. 
These people are not truly apolitical, 
they are just nonexpressive. 

The issue is the second type of 

people, those who choose to not 
be political, and instead, show off 
their unaltered lives in this political 
climate. Being apolitical is a privilege 
— being able to ignore current events 
or how the decisions politicians make 
affect your daily life is an example 
of privilege. These people are not 
only demonstrating that they do not 
need to concern themselves with the 
changes in our country that impact 
tens of millions of others, but they 
are willing to actively steer societal 
conversations away from those 
changes.

On Jan. 6, Trump supporters 

charged the U.S. Capitol in a white 
supremacist attempt to stop the 
confirmation 
of 
President-elect 

Joe Biden. The response by the 
police to this event highlighted the 
stark contrast between the Black 
community’s 
experiences 
with 

the police and that of the white 

community. Namely, law enforcement 
was far more violent toward Black 
Lives Matter protesters this summer 
than toward the predominantly white 
rioters storming the Capitol building.

On 
the 
Thursday 
following 

the event on Jan. 6, Facebook 
CEO 
Mark 
Zuckerberg 
chose 

to 
suspend 
President 
Donald 

Trump’s Facebook account after 
being flagged several times on the 
platform for misinformation. This 
series of events established plenty 
of opportunities to get political on 
social media, and many college 
students did.

While many people chose to use 

social media to show solidarity and 
spread information, plenty of people 
were posting anything other than 
the content that mattered for the day. I 
was disturbed by a picture of a Spotify 
song recommendation or dinner 
array at a hotel restaurant in Florida 
amid the postings of rioters sitting 
at House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s, 
D-Calif., desk and scaling the walls of 
our nation’s Capitol building.

With the heightened political 

atmosphere this past year with the 
election, the Black Lives Matter 
movement and the pandemic, most 
people can agree that 2020 was hard 
on our mental well-being. It is easy to 
see how people would need a break 
from social media and the constant 
flood of news. It is also easy to feel 
suffocated by all of the Instagram 
stories and Tweets that may begin 
to lose educational value over time. 
I cannot emphasize enough that 
choosing to not participate in social 
media politics is OK, but choosing 
ignorance in a tumultuous time by 
sharing examples of an unharmed, 
privileged life is not.

‘M’ navigates past ranked opponents 

to begin shortened season

With 
every 
other 
match 

clinched, 
Michigan 
freshman 

Merri Kelly found herself in 
a third-set tiebreaker, and all 
eyes turned to her. Kelly and 
Wisconsin sophomore Charmaine 
Seah traded points until Kelly’s 
groundstrokes eventually proved 
too much to handle, taking a 10-8 
victory in the tiebreaker. 

The Michigan women’s tennis 

team’s return to the Varsity Tennis 
Center was flooded with late game 
heroics, yet the highlight of the 
weekend was the Wolverines’ new 
faces and their ability to respond to 
adversity. 

“I think our freshman class is 

as good as any in the country,” 
Wolverines’ coach Ronni Bernstein 
said. “I see them stepping up and 
having a huge impact for us this 
year.”

Freshman 
Jaedan 
Brown 

proved 
Bernstein’s 
point 
by 

opening her second day of singles 
with a dominant first-set win over 
Northwestern sophomore Briana 
Crowley, 
6-0. 
Crowley 
came 

storming back, taking the next set, 
6-4, and jumped out a 2-0 lead in 
the third. Brown responded by 
winning six of the next eight games, 
taking a 6-0, 4-6, 6-4 victory. 

“(Brown’s) maybe one of our 

best,” Bernstein said. “It’s still 
early obviously, but with her skills, 
I think she could be a great player 
for us.”

Freshman Gala Mesochoritou 

joined the mix after falling just 
short in a crushing 6-7 (4) first-
set 
defeat 
against 
Wildcats’ 

sophomore 
Christina 
Hand. 

Showing composure beyond her 
years, Mesochoritou extended the 
match with a gritty 7-5 second-
set victory before cruising 6-2 in 
the third, including an emphatic 
overhead to finish the match. 

Freshman Kari Miller played 

with a lead for most of the 
weekend, but she handled the 
pressure confidently when the 
time came. Ohio State junior Kolie 
Allen pushed Miller to the brink 
on the final day of the tournament, 
where Miller found herself down 
the majority of the first set before 
clawing her way back to tie things 
at six apiece. 

“(Miller) is going to be really 

good and already is,” Bernstein 
said. “She doesn’t take a ball off 
ever.” 

Miller snatched the tiebreaker 

7-5 and never looked back en 
route to a 6-1 victory in the 
second.

Kelly, Brown, Mesochoritou 

and Miller combined for an 11-1 
record over the weekend in their 
singles debut, putting the rest of 
the Big Ten on notice. 

The Wolverines’ freshman 

class 
came 
in 
with 
lofty 

expectations as highly touted 
recruits, but their early success 
is a product of more than just 
talent.

The 
influx 
of 
freshman 

has bolstered a lineup with 
experienced, 
tested 
players 

ready 
to 
lead 
their 
new 

teammates. 
Graduate 
student 

Chiara Lommer’s role on the team 
has expanded to far more than 
winning matches. 

“We talk to our team about this: 

(Lommer) doesn’t give up, doesn’t 
quit on one point,” Bernstein said. 
“She’s an incredible competitor 
and it’s awesome for the younger 
kids to see that because she wins 
by fighting.”

Lommer isn’t just a leader 

by example. Her intensity is 
commanding and infectious. 

“(Lommer) is probably the 

best person to play doubles with 
because she’s always so positive 
with you,” Bernstein said. “I think 
it helps (Brown) at moments when 
the pressure is on.” 

In 
matches 
defined 
by 

momentum swings, the young 
Wolverines often had their backs 
against the wall, but they took it as 
an opportunity to showcase their 
resolve and relentless effort early 
on in Michigan’s season. 

“Their tennis speaks for itself,” 

Bernstein said. “They fit in and 
they work hard. 

“Our girls respect them a lot on 

the court already.”

Wolverine weekend sweep

Expectedly, the sentence “I’ve 

broken my legs around 16 times” 
often takes people by surprise.

For 
many 
who 
share 
the 

unfortunate 
commonality 
of 

having suffered a leg fracture, the 
experience is regarded as one of 
their most traumatic. The logical, 
justified follow-up to such an 
incredible statement would be to 
explain the ways in which these 
fractures negatively impacted their 
own life — the frustrations, the 
limited mobility, the pain. 

For Michigan Adaptive Sports 

and Fitness athlete and decorated 
grad-student 
and 
wheelchair 

tennis player Chris Kelley — who 
has, in fact, broken his legs 16 
times — this isn’t the case. Instead, 
Kelley quickly follows up with a 
qualification designed to illustrate 
that he’s come away from these 
experiences not with a desire for 
sympathy, but a sense of gratitude 
that things aren’t worse than they 
are.

“I have a pretty mild form of a 

pretty severe case,” Kelley said. “It 
could be significantly worse than 
what it is.”

Kelley 
was 
born 
with 

osteogenesis imperfecta, a very 
rare genetic disease. Also known 
as 
‘brittle 
bone’ 
disease, 
the 

genetic abnormality means that 
the production of the structurally 
important 
protein 
known 
as 

collagen is abnormally produced 
in the body. As a result, parts of 
the body that depend on collagen 
to function properly are negatively 
affected, with bones being the 
primary example. Those with 
osteogenesis imperfecta experience 
bone 
fractures 
at 
very 
high 

frequencies, limiting their ability 
to participate in most contact 
activities.

“Thankfully, I’ve only really had 

it impact my legs. I’ve never broken 
my arms and I’ve never broken 
a rib, so I’m pretty lucky,” Kelley 
continued.

Some of those who have suffered 

more severe leg fractures require 
what’s called a “rodding” surgery, 
wherein a metal rod is inserted 
into the leg to stabilize the bone 
and reduce the likelihood of future 
fractures. The vast majority of those 
who undergo a rodding surgery 

only ever need one. Kelley has had 
four — both of Kelley’s femurs and 
tibias are supported by large metal 
rods.

Through a combination of innate 

talent and sheer determination, 
however, 
Kelley 
has 
rendered 

these tribulations largely obsolete. 
Despite getting a relatively late 
start to wheelchair tennis — he 
only began to play organized 
tennis during his freshman year 
of high school — Kelley has forged 
an extremely successful career for 
himself.

By his junior year of high school, 

Kelley was selected to represent the 
U.S. Junior team at the World Team 
Cup, one of wheelchair tennis’s 
biggest international showcases. 
He performed well and was 
subsequently asked to be part of the 
United States Developmental team, 
putting Kelley in a prime position 
to eventually be promoted to the 
men’s national team, the pinnacle of 
wheelchair tennis in the U.S.

“He can definitely be a part of our 

team USA that goes and represents 
us as part of the World Team Cup 
for the men’s team,” one of Kelley’s 
national 
team 
coaches, 
John 

Devorss, said. “He’s dedicated, he’s 
a great competitor and he works 
hard, so time will tell.”

Upon obtaining his bachelor’s 

degree in social work from Grand 
Valley State University, Kelley 
decided to take some time before 
returning to school for his master’s 
degree to fully immerse himself in 
the world of wheelchair tennis.

“It was definitely one of the most 

fun gap years that I think anybody 
could have,” Kelley said with a grin.

During that time off, Kelley 

crisscrossed the U.S., competing in 
tournaments in places like Oregon, 
California 
and 
Florida. 
With 

each match, his reputation as a 
formidable competitor grew.

“He had an absolutely fabulous 

year,” Craig Kelley, Chris’s father, 
said. “Less than six losses the entire 
season. It was tremendous.

By the end of 2019, Kelley ranked 

second in the United States Tennis 
Association’s Men’s A division 
for wheelchair tennis. Soon, he 
planned to move into the Men’s 
Open division, the most prestigious 
international division in the sport. 
As a part of the Open division, Kelley 
would be competing alongside 
athletes like Shingo Kunieda and 

Gustavo Fernandez, the world’s 
very best wheelchair tennis players.

However, as the year 2020 rolled 

around, the COVID-19 pandemic 
quickly dashed Kelley’s hopes of 
moving into the Open division. His 
ascendancy would have to be put on 
hold — for now. 

With a break in the action, Kelley 

decided that it was time to return to 
school to obtain his master’s degree 
and become part of a collegiate 
wheelchair tennis program. Given 
his meteoric rise in 2019, he was 
hotly recruited by a number of 
renowned programs. Among them 
was the University of Alabama, 
a powerhouse in the collegiate 
adaptive sports world and winner 

of five of the last seven wheelchair 
tennis 
national 
championships. 

Also among them, however, was 
Michigan — a program in its 
infancy looking to gather enough 
athletes to even begin competing at 
the national level.

For the extraordinary amount 

of work required to overcome the 
hardships he’d faced up to that point, 
Kelley certainly would have been 
forgiven for opting for the easier 
route and joining the established 
Alabama program. After all, their 
recent record imparts little doubt 
that they’ll be among the favorites 
to win the wheelchair tennis title 
for years to come.

Instead, he chose Michigan. 

Kelley chose the project.

“I saw the University of Michigan 

not only as a way to be an adaptive 

athlete, but also as a way to help 
grow the program into being one of 
the best in the nation,” Kelley said.

And maybe fate played a bit 

of a role. Shortly after his first 
e-mail correspondence with Dr. 
Feranmi Okanlami, the Director 
of Michigan’s Adaptive Sports 
and Fitness program, Kelley was 
flying home from a tournament in 
New York. After passing through 
security, a voice from behind asked, 
“Hey, are you Chris Kelley?” 

Startled and slightly unnerved 

at being referred to by name 
immediately after a typically uneasy 
TSA encounter, Kelley turned to 
find none other than Okanlami.

“After that, I thought maybe 

Michigan is the place where I’m 
supposed to be,” Kelley said.

Although the lack of competitive 

opportunities in 2020 was a 
disappointment, it wasn’t the end 
of the world for Kelley. With his 
now-slender schedule, Kelley set his 
sights on a different pursuit: finding 
ways to help expand access to sports 
for individuals with disabilities.

When one hears of a story like 

Kelley’s — a highly talented athlete 
arriving late on the scene yet still 
managing to rapidly ascend the 
ranks of their sport — one question 
begs to be answered. Why didn’t 
they start sooner?

In Kelley’s case, and in the case 

of so many other athletes with 
disabilities, the answer seems to 
be that they simply didn’t know 
that opportunities for them to 

participate 
in 
sports 
existed. 

Despite their good intentions, 
Kelley’s elementary and middle 
school physical education teachers 
often simply didn’t know how to get 
him involved safely.

“Giving 
P.E. 
teachers 
and 

educators the tools to introduce 
adaptive sports to students with 
disabilities is a huge part of it,” 
Kelley said.

“The 
other 
main 
one 
is 

physicians,” Kelley added. “I was 
diagnosed at the age of two. I had 
doctor’s appointments constantly, 
and I don’t remember a physician 
ever mentioning that adaptive 
sports were a possibility.”

Kelley is convinced that this can 

be remedied. Over the summer, 
Kelley worked closely with Adaptive 
Sports and Fitness staff members 
to develop the ASIRI project, a 
collaboration with Project Healthy 
Schools to develop a more inclusive 
physical 
education 
curriculum. 

The curriculum aims to embed 
adaptive 
sports 
and 
inclusive 

recreation programming into the 
physical education experience of 
young students with and without 
physical disabilities across the state 
of Michigan.

After he completes his master’s 

in sports management, Kelley 
hopes to continue working with 
the Adaptive Sports and Fitness 
program full-time.

“One of my main goals is to grow 

adaptive sports at the university 
level, so I want to find ways to get 
involved and stay involved as much 
as I can,” Kelley said.

While Kelley aims to continue 

to expand access to sports for 
individuals with disabilities by 
developing more projects like the 
ASIRI project in the future, his true 
passion lies elsewhere — coaching.

“I’ll look for adaptive sports 

jobs first with the hopes of finding 
something where I can either 
develop a program or do some 
diversity, equity and inclusion 
work,” Kelley said. “But if I can 
coach out on the court for even one 
day a week, that fills my bucket. It’s 
my dream job.”

Kelley has been coaching tennis 

for nearly as long as he’s been 
playing. In high school, Kelley got 
his first taste of coaching while 
helping out with local children’s 
programs. Throughout his time at 
Grand Valley, Kelley subsequently 

expanded his coaching to include 
adult classes at a nearby tennis club.

Since then, Kelley hasn’t been 

able to get enough of it — he’s traveled 
across the Midwest with the United 
States Tennis Association to lead 
wheelchair tennis clinics, taken 
on the role of coach for Mary Free 
Bed Rehabilitation Hospital’s youth 
wheelchair tennis team and has 
spent a year as the assistant coach 
of a high school varsity tennis team.

“I love that he’s somebody who’s 

teaching both kids and adults, both 
able-bodied and in wheelchairs,” 
Devorss said. “Truly, that’s an 
amazing thing. It’s rare.”

Kelley’s coaching acumen is 

bolstered by support from his 
father, Craig, an experienced tennis 
coach with a degree from Ferris 
State University in Professional 
Tennis Management. The two have 
coached alongside each other at a 
number of camps, allowing Kelley 
to draw directly from the wisdom 
of his father.

“He’ll even help me too, at times,” 

Craig Kelley said. “He’ll say ‘Hey, I 
think you might be being a little 
too firm with the kids.’ It goes both 
ways.”

From his many years of coaching, 

Craig Kelley has come to realize the 
most important concept to instill 
in the minds of young players, a 
concept Chris has already taken to 
heart in his own coaching. 

“Above anything, it’s the love of 

the game,” he said. “You want to 
make sure that you keep the spirit 
within them, making sure that they 
want to come back and play day 
after day.”

Added Chris: “It’s important 

to realize that sport is supposed 
to be a good opportunity to grow 
a community and to get physical 
activity. It’s not life or death.”

One day, Chris Kelley admits, 

there’ll come a point in time 
when continuing to compete will 
no longer be an option. Years of 
swinging a racket with extreme 
force will mean Kelley’s shoulder 
cuffs and wrists will deteriorate. 
Eventually, his body simply won’t 
be able to sustain the wear and tear 
any longer.

Before fully setting his sights 

on coaching, however, there’s one 
thing Kelley is adamant about 
accomplishing.

“I 
want 
that 
national 

championship ring,” Kelley said.

Chris Kelley has fast risen to the top of wheelchair tennis’s rankings.

Diving 
head-first 
into 
the 

season, 
the 
No. 
9 
women’s 

swimming and diving team (2-0) 
put critics’ questions to bed with 
a convincing double dual meet 
performance.

The Wolverines reigned over 

No. 20 Indiana (1-1) and No. 24 
Northwestern (0-2) on Saturday 
as they beat the Wildcats 185.5-
112.5 and outpaced the Hoosiers 
174-126. Michigan dominated the 
freestyle events in its first meet 
since the Big Ten Championship 
last February. 

Senior Sierra Schmidt and 

sophomore Kaitlynn Sims placed 
first and second, respectively, 
in 
the 
1000-yard 
and 
500-

yard freestyles. Junior Maggie 
MacNeil took home first in the 
200-yard freestyle, while senior 
Daria Pyshnenko won the 50 and 
100-yard freestyles. MacNeil and 
Pyshnenko — along with freshman 
Sophie Housey and junior Olivia 
Carter — teamed up for first in the 
400-yard freestyle relay.

While MacNeil is no stranger 

to freestyle events, she does not 
regularly swim the 200-yard 
freestyle for the Wolverines. Her 
victory was quite special against 
swimmers who train specifically 
for the event.

“(MacNeil’s 
200-yard 

performance) was something that 
coach Rick Bishop did to win the 
200-yard 
freestyle,” 
Michigan 

coach Mike Bottom said. “We’ll 
take them where we can get them. 
That’s part of being a coach.”

MacNeil was also slated to 

swim the 100-yard freestyle, but 
Pyshnenko replaced her at the last 
minute, making a sacrifice to help 
lift her team.

“We had a moment where 

MacNeil was supposed to swim 
the 100 freestyle and wasn’t 
feeling up to par,” Bottom said. 
“(Pyshnenko) had to step up to 
win that 100 freestyle.”

One of the most exciting races 

of the day was the 200-yard 
backstroke, in which sophomore 
Mariella 
Venter, 
freshman 

Casey 
Chung 
and 
freshman 

Sophia Tuinman placed in first, 
second and third, respectively. 
Chung, Venter and Tuinman also 
placed first, second and fourth, 

respectively 
in 
the 
100-yard 

backstroke.

Carter played a key role for 

the team, winning both butterfly 
events and the 200-yard individual 
medley. In the 200-yard butterfly, 
Carter finished more than four 
seconds ahead of her opponents.

Slower times were expected 

at this meet as the teams placed 
focus on the late February Big 
Ten Championship, but the effort 
clearly remained as the athletes 
raced for the first time in what 
seems like ages.

Carter praised Housey and 

junior Victoria Kwan for the 
grueling schedules they faced. 
With 
Kwan 
facing 
a 
quick 

turnaround between the 200 and 
100-yard butterfly, she had little 
time to recover between events. 
Housey took a similar turnaround 
in stride, this time just an event 
separating her performances in 
the 200-yard individual medley 
and 200-yard freestyle relay.

Despite 
the 
Wolverines 

facing more of a struggle in 
the dive events, some positives 
could be taken from the team’s 
performance. 
Senior 
diver 

Christy Cutshaw placed fifth in 
the 1-meter dive and seventh in 
the 3-meter coming back from 
an injury, and freshman Taylor 
Peters made her debut at the 
meet.

Not only does the meet raise 

expectations for the rest of this 
season, but also for future seasons. 
With 
underclassmen 
playing 

a significant role in the team’s 
success, this meet showed that 
the team possesses the tools to be 
a long-term threat for the Big Ten 
Championship.

Despite 
being 
the 
first 

formal meet since last February, 
Michigan looked ready to go from 
the start of the day. Whatever 
rust existed from the long gap in 
competitions seemed negligible 
for the Wolverines, who proved to 
be a well oiled-machine.

Sophomore Paul Juda took 

a deep breath and broke into 
a sprint for the vault. Juda, 
the 
fourth 
in 
Michigan’s 

vault rotation, was following 
three subpar vaults from the 
Wolverines. 
With 
Illinois-

Chicago holding a 0.100 point 
lead in the round, Juda knew his 
opportunity to shift the round 
in his team’s favor lay within 
his grasp.

With all eyes on him, Juda 

leaped over the vault and 
stuck the landing, letting out 
an emphatic roar while his 
teammates 
rushed 
towards 

him.

Juda earned a 14.650 for the 

vault, the highest vault and 
individual score up until that 
point. Michigan went on to win 
the round behind subsequent 
strong finishes from senior 
Nick Guy and sophomore Adam 
Wooten, and the Wolverines 
closed out UIC with resounding 
victories in the last two rounds. 

No.

Michigan 
men’s 

gymnastics (1-0) opened its 
season with a 409.000-328.100 
dual meet win against the 
Flames (0-1) on Sunday, with 
each team performing at its 
respective training facilities. 
Despite the unusual format 
of virtual judging and the 

absence of fans, the Wolverines 
showcased their preparedness 
from the very beginning. 

“They seemed to keep the 

energy 
up,” 
said 
Michigan 

coach Kurt Golder. “They did a 
great job as the meet went on. 
Enthusiasm didn’t slow down 
or dwindle away or anything 
like that.”

Wooten opened for Michigan 

in round one, floor exercise, 
and earned a score of 13.400, 
immediately setting the tone for 
the entire meet. The Wolverines 
went on to win each of their 
next five matchups and finished 
with a steep 11.150 lead over 
UIC. 

Michigan further extended 

its lead to 31.200 following 
round 
two, 
pommel 
horse. 

Senior Anthony Tawfik opened 
for Michigan, while senior 
Cameron 
Bock 
earned 
the 

highest score of the round with 
a 14.400. It looked as if the 
Wolverines couldn’t be stopped.

The 
next 
round, 
rings, 

mirrored rounds one and two, 
with 
strong 
performances 

overall 
from 
Michigan’s 

rotation. 

Sophomore Casey Cummings 

opened 
round 
four 
(vault) 

for Michigan. At this point, 
with a 48.350 lead and all the 
momentum in their favor, the 
Wolverines looked to cap off 
their 
outstanding 
routines 

from the previous three rounds 
and push their lead out of 
reach. Desperate to keep their 
hopes alive, the Flames strung 
together an impressive first 
three vaults and gained a lead 
over Michigan. But just as UIC 
began building confidence, Juda 
stepped up to the challenge. 

“I live for the clutch, I live 

for the pressure,” Juda said. “A 
quote that I resonate with is ‘it’s 
a privilege to have pressure.’ 
I knew the guys really were 
counting on me to do a good 
routine right there, and I had to 
do it.”

Michigan cruised through 

parallel bars and high bar, 
with Juda earning the highest 
individual score of 14.700 in 
parallel bars. He had the best 
overall performance and led 
the team in four events, with 
Bock leading the team in the 
remaining two. 

Michigan’s first competition 

ended 
just 
as 
it 
planned, 

securing a commanding lead 
from the get-go and winning 
each round handily. 

The Wolverines face No. 

4 Nebraska next week, the 
first 
of 
many 
tough 
Big 

Ten 
matchups. 
Michigan’s 

mentality is to do everything it 
can to win, and the Wolverines 
will need to show the same 
dominance on the road as they 
did on Sunday.

Wolverines ready to regroup after first loss

“When 
the 
street 
fight 

started, we didn’t answer it.”

Michigan men’s basketball 

team’s assistant coach Phil 
Martelli’s 
words 
perfectly 

encapsulated the scene of the 
Wolverines’ first defeat of the 
season which came on the 
road at the hands of then-No. 
23 Minnesota on Saturday. 
After 
coming 
into 
the 

contest averaging 80.2 points 
per 
game, 
Michigan 
only 

managed to put up 57 points 
in an 18-point loss and tied its 
season-high 20 turnovers. 

“You can practice it as 

many times as you want, but if 
you make a bad decision in the 
game, that’s just the way it is 
sometimes,” sophomore wing 
Franz Wagner said.

While 
the 
whole 
team 

was 
disappointed 
in 
its 

performance, the Wolverines 
believe that their first loss can 
help them grow stronger. 

“Obviously everyone picks 

on what you did wrong, and 
they try to exploit ‘why didn’t 
you win,’ but there are good 
things that come out of losses,” 
graduate transfer guard Mike 
Smith said. “The one thing 
that I can take away from this 
is that we always have to be 
ready to go — 24/7 — and just 
continue to compete at the 
highest level because it’s not 
going to get any easier.”

After scoring in double-

figures in the first 11 games 
of 
his 
collegiate 
career, 

freshman 
center 
Hunter 

Dickinson was notably held to 
just nine points in 23 minutes. 

Gophers’ 
head 
coach 

Richard 
Pitino 
instructed 

his squad to double team 
Dickinson in the post nearly 
every time he touched the ball 
which gave both Dickinson 
and 
Michigan 
plenty 
of 

trouble.

“I didn’t think he was 

overdoing it,” Martelli said. “I 
think in a way he was not as 

sharp. He’s been so sharp and 
his IQ is so high. Rather than 
getting things done in a beat, 
it was taking him a beat and 
a half to recognize what was 
going on which was unusual.”

Alongside 
Dickinson, 

Smith struggled shooting the 
basketball as well. Despite 
having 10 assists, Smith failed 
to score a point, shooting 
0-of-6. He also turned the ball 
over three times in 37 minutes 
of action. It was a rare down 
game for Smith, who has 
averaged 8.4 points and 5.8 
assists per game and has 
served in a steady role as the 
team’s primary point guard.

“I 
did 
a 
poor 
job 
of 

leading the team regardless 
of scoring,” Smith said. “I 
think I should’ve led more 
and been more vocal. I take 
accountability for that. Being 
a point guard and being the 
older guy on the team, I think 
I fell short of doing that for 
the team.”

After the loss, Michigan 

held 
film 
sessions 
to 

understand 
where 
things 

went wrong. The film session 
helped to demonstrate to 
the team that Minnesota’s 
defense took it out of its 
normal 
offensive 
flow, 

forcing it to adjust its system 
that had proven to be so 
effective through 11 games 

on the fly. After breaking 
it 
down, 
though, 
the 

Wolverines think they may 
have found solutions on how 
to respond.

“I was surprised by the 

things we saw (on film), 
they’re pretty easy to fix 
I think,” Wagner said. “So 
that’s 
kinda 
my 
mindset 

going into the next game 
is we gotta play with our 
habits, what made us get 
those first couple games and 
then it doesn’t really matter 
that much what other teams 
throw at us.”

A loss, especially the first 

one of the season, is always 
a tough pill to swallow. 
But Smith believes that the 
loss will only strengthen 
the bond that he and his 
teammates have.

“A lot of teams, either that 

I’ve been on or in general, 
when you lose, people start 
pointing fingers,” Smith said. 
“But at the end of the day, 
even when we were down 
20 and the second team was 
in, we were up clapping for 
everybody. 

“We wanted to see them 

succeed because we know 
how much time they put in 
to be out there. This is going 
to help us become closer and 
want to win more and to fight 
for each other.”

Paul Juda’s dazzling performance in vault was critical to holding momentum in Michigan’s win.

JULIA SCHACHINGER/Daily

Michigan expects to bounce back against Maryland following its first loss 
of the season.

Russell Becker trudged out to the 

backyard, dragging the hose with 
him. A kid waddled through the 
snow, curtly behind him.

Boards. Check.
Lights. Check.
Goalposts. Check.
Russell ran down a mental list of 

things he had to prepare. Luckily 
for him, the kids were too young to 
need the nets. It was that time of 
year again — winter — an eagerly 
anticipated time for the Becker kids. 
As November approaches, so does 
Minnesota’s cold, harsh winter. But 
alongside the bitter winds that nip 
at their noses comes the chilling 
temperatures that let them host 
their own personal ice rink at their 
home.

Jack Becker followed his dad, 

helping him carry the hose through 
the basement doors leading from 
the back of their house to the open 
field where they had laid the rink 
boards prior.

Jack and his brothers always 

loved to help their father set the 
stage, but when it came to most of 
the heavy work, Russell did that by 
himself, at least until Jack reached 
the age where he could also do 
heavy lifting.

Jack loved the backyard rink. 

When his brothers could come out 
to skate with him, they would play 
games, pretending to be different 
NHL players. It was the spot he 
went to when he needed to practice. 
It was the spot he went to when his 
friends came over to play. It was the 
spot that he never wanted to leave, 
even when the ice became rough 
and cut up.

He took to it as often as he could.
***
Play stopped and all heads 

turned to Jack Becker, as the then-
11 year old was sprawled on the ice, 
breath heavy.

It was hard to see his face 

through his breath’s fog that 
condensed against the cold, hard, 
winter air of Duluth, Minn. But if 
you looked closely enough, past the 
mist and the clenched hand held 
up to his nose, you could see blood 
dripping down Jack’s face.

He was in his backyard, in the 

homemade ice rink his family put 
together — his personal kingdom, 
his own sanctuary. And yet, out 
there on his rink, he had taken a 
hard hit and was trying to contain 
his bloody nose.

It was around Christmas time 

and his extended family had 
gathered at their house to celebrate 
the holidays. Aunts, uncles, cousins: 
All came in to join the Beckers and, 
naturally, most of them took to the 
ice in the backyard. Hockey runs 
deep within their family’s roots.

His cousins played at Division 

I schools. His uncles had grown 
up playing all their lives. And his 
father, Russell Becker, played four 
years at Michigan Tech and helped 
coach Jack every step of his playing 
career.

When Jack was old enough to 

walk, Russell nudged him towards 
the ice. When he was old enough to 
play, Russell joined the bench as a 
coach to most of his teams.

And that day, Russell wanted to 

teach his son another lesson.

Russell was always a hard-nose, 

physically imposing player. When 
he played under then-Huskies 
coach Mel Pearson, he had to earn 
his stripes playing with hustle, 
effort and passion. And even after 
he stopped playing, he carried that 
mentality everywhere he went — 
including a festive backyard hockey 
game among the family.

That day, son and father split 

onto opposing teams. Neither side 
wanted to lose.

The rink — one that Jack and 

his dad had built together — was 
smaller than an average rink, but 
only by a bit. The tighter enclosure, 
however, meant that it would be 
more jam packed with action. And 
it was.

Jack saw it first hand when he 

went for the puck, blindsided by a 
check from his dad. It came to the 
surprise of none. Everyone there 
knew Russell liked to play hard. 
And that day, he made sure Jack 
knew.

Play stopped as Jack laid on the 

ground. Before anyone could go 
over to help him, or before Jack 
could patch up his wound, his dad 
came to him and told him exactly 
what he should do next: ‘Get up.’ 

Added Jack: “So I got up and just 

continued playing.”

For Russell, it was routine. Get 

hit, get up, hustle.

“(Russell) 
was 
obviously 
a 

big 
stay-at-home, 
hard-nosed 

defenseman,” Pearson said about 
his former player. “He was a strong 
kid, tough kid, was just a simple, just 
a simple player. You can see a lot of 
similarities with Jack. The dad was 
a solid no-nonsense, hardworking, 
very polite, humble type person, 
and that’s what you have in Jack.”

As soon as Jack picked up the 

sticks and put on the skates when 

he was three, Russell ran with it. 
From mini mites to as far as he 
could, Russell helped coach Jack, 
sitting behind his bench mostly as 
a defensive coach for the teams. 
But being able to coach Jack was 
enough.

“I look to my parents a lot for a 

lot of things in my life,” Jack said. “I 
think when on the ice he’s my coach, 
and you know, you gotta respect 
him, but he’s still your dad.”

In terms of playstyle, there’s 

not much to pass down. Russell 
specialized 
in 
hustle 
defense, 

Jack wanted to be a forward. Jack 
quickly became a better skater, 
as noted by Pearson, but Russell 
passed on his effort and work ethic 
and some defensive techniques.

“Sometimes, dads can be harder 

on their own son than they might 
be another player,” Pearson said. 
“Just they don’t want to show any 
favoritism. And I think you demand 
more out of your son than somebody 

else. You know, it’s always easier to 
get after your own kid than maybe 
to try to get after somebody else’s.”

Finding that balance between 

dad and coach took some time for 
Russell. Was he being too hard on 
Jack because Jack was his son? Was 
he letting him off the hook with 
something for the same reason? 
What would people think looking in 
from outside?

“You didn’t want other parents 

to think that you were being biased 
towards your kid,” Russell said. “All 
those types of things make it tough 

to be a dad and be a coach.”

But once he found the healthy 

median, it became a much simpler 
task. Jack was an easy kid to coach. 

“He’s just such a respectful kid,” 

Russell said. “From that standpoint 
… he was an easy kid to coach, he 
was always the hardest working kid 
on the team.”

It was an experience for Jack 

that he remembers fondly. He 
didn’t think about the intricacies 
of his father being his coach. He 
just treasured the moments where 
he could play while his dad was on 
the bench, helping him along the 
way.

“After high school, you know 

it’s never really going to happen 
again,” Jack said. “And Dad 
worked really hard to learn so 
many things from the ADM or the 
USA hockey development model 
there. He worked so hard to help 
us to have practice plans that were 
good. 

“I just thought it was such a 

blessing. Really fun having him as 
my coach.”

Even with all his father’s history 

in the sport, playing hockey was 
always a choice, never an obligation 
for Jack growing up. But being 
surrounded by hockey from a young 
age — between his uncles, cousins 
and, most importantly, his father 
— his mind had always been made 
from the get-go.

Jack loved hockey. He never 

wanted to leave the rink, any rink, 
whether he was playing or not. And 
his dad helped make that possible.

For a portion of Jack’s youth, 

Minnesota 
was 
without 
a 

professional hockey team after the 
North Stars moved to Dallas in 1993. 
However, after a small drought 
of professional hockey, in 1997, 
St. Paul, Minn. was awarded an 
expansion team. That team would 
become the Minnesota Wild, who 
had their inaugural season in 2000. 

The return of an NHL team in the 

state would domino to Minnesota 
hosting its first All Star Game in 32 
years during the 2003-04 season.

Russell decided it was a can’t 

miss event for him and his boys.

He wanted them to learn the 

game, in part, by watching and 
being around it, sure, but this was 
an event that only came around 
so often. He wanted them to just 
be able to be there and enjoy the 
moment.

Jack walked into the doors of 

the Xcel Energy Center side by side 
with his dad and one of his younger 
brothers, Joe. The then-six-and-a-
half year old could barely hold back 
his excitement. He had even thrown 
on the jersey of one of his favorite 
players, Marian Gaborik, for the 
occasion.

The trio had come early, hoping 

to catch the players warming up.

Together, they scaled the steps 

of the arena until they stopped at 
their seats, placed directly behind 
the glass. Russell and Joe began to 
sit down, but Jack had other plans. 
He stayed standing, mesmerized 
by the surroundings and hoping to 
get a better glimpse at the players as 
they came in.

His hands pressed against the 

glass, Jack leaned in, eyes wide in 
anticipation.

And then came the players, the 

All Stars.

Bursting in from the tunnel, 

they skated laps around the rink. In 
awe, Jack threw his hands over his 
mouth, a picture-perfect moment 
for the occasion.

That’s exactly how St. Paul 

Pioneer Press photographer passing 
by saw it too. The photographer 
snapped a picture of the moment 
and the next day, had it plastered on 
the front page — showing the world 
what the Becker family already 
knew.

“It’s a cool photo,” Russell said. 

“And it just shows at a very young 
age him gazing at these players and 
how much he loved the game.”

Added Jack’s mother, Trisha: 

“His face is priceless because he is 
looking out the glass and you can see 
his reflection in the glass. He is so 
happy to be there and so consumed 
by the whole scene that he just looks 
like that’s exactly where he wants to 
be, in the rink.”

***
Back home, when dusk came 

around, the skating on the ice didn’t 
stop even as the puck started to 
blend in with the darkness that 
surrounded it. Time didn’t deter 
Jack, all he had to do was flick the 
switch for the lights, and continue 
to skate on his outdoor rink.

It was a joy for him to be out 

there, no matter the hour.

“I always say that Jack has 

always had a passion, and you can’t 
really teach a passion,” Trisha said. 
“He just really loves to be on the ice. 
He just really has always loved to be 
out there.”

Early in the morning, late at 

night, nothing stopped him from 
being in the rink. The nets came out 
when he got older to make it easier 
to catch flying pucks. The lights 
came on when it got dark. 

A bad practice didn’t discourage 

him. Neither did a bad day in 
general. When he could, he’d make 
his way to the ice and shoot. It was 
a way to outlet his thoughts and, 
sometimes, his emotions.

“Whether it’s a stress relief or 

he just enjoys the whole process of 
being on the ice,it is a good stress 
reliever for him.” Trisha said. “He’s 
always pretty focused on it.”

For Jack, it is therapeutic.

MICHIGAN DOMINATES OHIO STATE IN SEASON-OPENING MEET

Both Michigan and Ohio State 

experienced setbacks on the uneven 

bars. The difference came in the way 

the two squads responded.

For the Wolverines, junior Abby 

Heiskell barely missed the bar on 

her way down from an aerial off 

the high bar and fell onto the mat. 

Her teammates picked her up and 

finished the bars with three straight 

9.9-plus scores to close out the event, 

punctuated by junior Natalie Wojcik’s 

emphatic fist as she pumped it in 

victory upon landing her own 9.925 

routine.

Ohio State, meanwhile, couldn’t 

muster 
a 
similar 
response. 
It 

couldn’t match the firepower of the 

Wolverines on either of the first 

two events, or indeed in the entire 

meet, as Michigan (1-0) surpassed 

Ohio State (0-1), 197.225-196.000, on 

Saturday.

“On any event, you have to be able to 

recover from a mistake, and I thought 

on both bars and beam the team did a 

great job of not allowing one mistake 

to affect their performance when 

they came after,” Michigan coach 

Bev Plocki said. “I would not expect 

perfection on the first meet out so I’m 

not upset that we had a mistake, but 

we learned from it.”

Raina Malas’s early mistake on 

the uneven bars didn’t spell doom 

for the Buckeyes in and of itself, but 

it did take away options on their path 

to victory. Options that were few to 

begin with.

At the halfway point in the meet, 

Michigan held a 0.775 point lead over 

its rival, thanks in large part to that 

strong committee on bars. Junior 

Abby Brenner had her highest-scoring 

bar routine since 2019, notching a 

9.900.

Fellow junior Maddie Mariani also 

matched a career-best score with 

9.900 on beam with a routine that 

made her appear glued to the beam, 

tying with junior Natalie Wojcik for 

a team-high.

“(Mariani) was remarkable on 

beam, and that’s what she’s capable 

of,” Plocki said. “She’s becoming 

more experienced in learning how to 

handle her nerves under pressure and 

do that routine like she does in front 

of us every day in practice.”

The remaining options for Ohio 

State to notch a comeback were 

dashed by the anchors of Michigan’s 

roster. Sophomores Gabby Wilson 

and Sierra Brooks, coupled with 

Wojcik, were on point throughout the 

meet. As the only three gymnasts to 

compete in all four events for either 

team, seven of their 12 performances 

surpassed the 9.900 mark, while only 

once did the Buckeyes’ entire squad 

have a routine reach it.

“That’s what it’s all about, it’s 

having those athletes that are rock 

solid and they can do it week in and 

week-out,” Plocki said. “Regardless of 

what happened before them, they can 

go out there when the lights turn on 

and perform.”

Sprinkled throughout the meet 

were moments of exaltation. Wojcik’s 

triumphant fist bump on bars was 

accompanied by Brenner’s shout of 

victory following her floor routine. 

The energy built from the very first 

run on vault and ended in a victorious 

applause at the end of Wojcik’s 

clinical floor routine.

At the end of the night, six of the 

top seven routines on vault were by 

Michigan athletes, leading to a 49.300 

score. Five of the top six routines 

on bars led to 49.400. Six of the top 

eight routines on floor led to 49.450. 

Only on beam did the Wolverines fall 

behind the Buckeyes: Its 49.075 score 

lost to 49.100.

Michigan’s meet on Saturday was 

an exhibition in excellence. From its 

start on vault, the team clad in blue 

came out prepared and determined, 

snatched a lead and never gave it back. 

And though they didn’t lack mistakes, 

the Wolverines overcame them in a 

way its opponent couldn’t: Through 

depth, through inspired routines and 

through emphatic determination.

Johnson and Beniers lead the 

way for Michigan’s offense

Tune into a Michigan hockey 

game and chances are that Kent 

Johnson and Matty Beniers will 

catch your eye. 

The freshman forwards have 

taken the Big Ten by storm this year, 

playing on a line together. Johnson 

has been on a torrent scoring pace 

with a team-leading 16 points — 

and his 12 assists top the Big Ten. 

Beniers has been successful in his 

own right, as his 11 points indicate, 

the third-highest total on the team. 

“They’re really engaged with 

each other as far as how they want 

to play,” Michigan coach Mel 

Pearson said. “Matty’s probably 

got a little bit more of a motor and 

speed. Kent’s a little bit better 

cerebrally and (with) what he does 

with the puck. But they both read 

off each other extremely well.”

Putting the duo together paid 

off almost instantly. In their first 

collegiate hockey game against 

Arizona State, Beniers found the 

back of the net twice and Johnson 

had the primary assist on both 

goals. They’ve only gotten more 

comfortable with each other as the 

season has gone on. 

“We both know where we are, 

where we’re going to be when we’re 

going around the ice and where 

we want the puck when we’re 

shooting,” Beniers said. “We’re just 

building chemistry right now.”

They have contrasting styles on 

the ice, but their combination of 

abilities makes them tough to beat. 

Beniers stands out for his ability 

to play a 200-foot game. He’ll be 

circling around the offensive zone 

looking for a scoring opportunity 

then moments later hustling back to 

play defense. And he doesn’t let up 

the entire game. 

“He’s never taken a day off, he 

doesn’t know how to,” assistant 

coach Kris Mayotte said. “His 

motor and his compete is elite. You 

don’t coach that; it’s something 

special that he has in him.”

Johnson, meanwhile, has a 

dazzling flare to his game and 

can pull out highlight reel plays 

at a moment’s notice. Much like 

Beniers’s ability to grind out long 

possessions on both ends of the ice, 

Johnson’s flashy moves are more of 

a natural instinct than a coachable 

trait. 

“I just try to not really think 

when I play and just let my training 

and my subconscious do the work,” 

Johnson said. “If I feel like I need to 

do something between my legs to 

make the best play, then I’ll do it.”

Johnson and Beniers are both 

currently projected as top ten picks 

in the 2021 NHL draft. Having 

two top NHL prospects on a line 

together is a rare privilege, and 

the Wolverines have taken full 

advantage of it. 

Before 
the 
season, 
Pearson 

emphasized that the key to strong 

lines is to have two guys who play 

well together and then build off of 

it. It’s been a revolving door at right 

wing on the line, but it hasn’t slowed 

the duo’s production. 

“I think you’ll see them be even 

better in the second half,” Pearson 

said. “We just got to find the right 

guy to put on the right side with 

them.”

Michigan has a lot of talent on its 

roster, but if it wants to make a deep 

tournament run, it will have to push 

the right buttons to maximize that 

talent. Halfway through the season, 

it’s clear that pairing Beniers and 

Johnson together has been a step 

towards achieving just that. 

“We saw from day one, they’re 

smart players,” Pearson said. “A 

smart player needs smart players to 

play with them.”

Freshman forward Matty Beniers has registered 11 points this season playing on a line with Kent Johnson.

For Ziyah Holman, stunning comeback brings moment in the spotlight

By now, you’ve probably seen 

the clip. If you haven’t, Mich-

igan freshman Ziyah Holman 

takes the baton for the final 

leg of the 4x400 relay at Sat-

urday’s Sim-

mons-Harvey 

Invitational 

from 25 

meters 

behind her 

closest com-

petitor. With-

in seconds, 

she passes an 

Ohio State 

runner. A lap later — mere steps 

from the finish line — she uses a 

final burst to bury Indiana too, 

winning the race for Michigan 

with a 51.79 second split.

“51 seconds of thrill” is 

how Anthony Belber, her high 

school coach at Georgetown 

Day School in Washington, D.C. 

describes it. On social media, 

hundreds of thousands feel the 

same way. As of Tuesday after-

noon, the video has 454,000 

views on Facebook, 204,000 on 

Twitter and 47,000 on Insta-

gram.

What hasn’t made the social 

media rounds is Holman’s 600-

meter race an hour and a half 

earlier. There’s less drama to 

that one because she won by 

four seconds with a time of 

1:29.27, topping a pair of Ohio 

State seniors. “It was a stadium 

record, a meet record and an 

NCAA lead (for the season),” 

Holman said by phone Tues-

day, with the nonchalance that 

accompanies expectation.

After all, she’s used to this. 

She’s been an anchor in the 

4x400 since she was a freshman 

in high school. The only time 

she can remember not being in 

that position was at the 2019 

Pan American U20 Champi-

onships when her team set an 

under-20 world record. So when 

she took the baton Saturday 

afternoon, she just reminded 

herself to do what she was 

taught.

“Just go test them, honestly,” 

Holman said. “Just go get them, 

see how far you can get. As the 

race keeps going, you see your-

self getting closer. Like oh my 

god, I’m actually getting closer. 

Why would I try so hard and 

not try to win?”

When she did, it was more 

familiar than anything. “All the 

time in high school, honestly,” 

Holman said when asked if 

she’s ever experienced a similar 

comeback. “That was my thing.”

Five hundred miles away, 

those were the memories that 

raced to Belber’s mind as he 

watched on a live stream. As 

Holman took the baton, he 

turned to his daughters and 

said, “If this were high school, 

she would’ve caught those girls, 

but this is too big of a gap for 

college.” 51.79 seconds later, 

Holman proved it wasn’t.

“I know how strong she is, 

but it even blew away my expec-

tations for what kind of a time 

she would be running this time 

of year,” Belber said. “She made 

the college athletes around her 

look like they were just high 

schoolers.”

For Holman, the race itself 

wasn’t as stunning as the social 

media attention it garnered. For 

47 months, every four years, 

track is a sport that often blends 

into the background. She was a 

three-time Gatorade Player of 

the Year in high school, but that 

doesn’t bring the same fame as 

it does in football and basket-

ball. So when Saturday’s video 

went viral, it brought Holman 

a level of attention she’s never 

experienced before.

“I’ve gotten so many messag-

es, it’s not even funny,” Holman 

said. “I feel so bad because I’m 

still replying — trying to reply 

— to everyone, but honestly 

it’s pretty impossible. I’m still 

replying to stuff from Satur-

day.”

Since Saturday, she estimated 

she’s gotten 500 direct messag-

es from family, friends and fans 

across Instagram and Twitter, 

with about 100 left to respond 

to. It’s not all positive, though. 

Holman said she’s gotten one or 

two racist messages, which she 

brushes off with an admirable 

absence of second thought.

“I can’t sit here cursing peo-

ple if I wanted to, because that’s 

not done with class,” Holman 

said. More than anything, that’s 

the lasting difference in her life 

from Saturday morning. With 

one stunning, come-from-be-

hind leg of a 4x400, she’s imme-

diately been thrust into the 

public eye. 

“It’s real, people are watch-

ing me now,” she added. “Any-

thing that you do has to be done 

with class, honestly, because 

you have so many people at your 

back.”

If everything goes accord-

ing to plan, Holman will have 

even more people at her back 

this summer. Before COVID-19 

postponed the 2020 Olym-

pics to this summer, she had 

received an invite to Olympic 

trials for the 400 meters. She’ll 

almost certainly be invited 

again, this time with a year of 

college training and experience 

under her belt.

“It gave me some more time 

and more confidence, honest-

ly,” Holman said. “I don’t know 

what I would’ve done last year.”

That’s the other impact of 

Saturday’s race. In 2016, the 

eighth and final American 

to qualify for the 400 meters 

posted a 51.80 in trials. If 

Holman can repeat Saturday’s 

performance, she’ll put her-

self in strong contention to do 

the same. And while athletes 

generally post faster times 

with running starts in relays, 

Holman did so on an indoor 

track — which has more turns 

— and with tired legs from 

her previous accolades that 

day.

If she does qualify for the 

Olympics, she’ll have reached 

her ultimate goal. But for now, 

Saturday’s meet — the first of 

her college career — is a pretty 

good place to start.

“I had no idea what was 

gonna happen,” Holman 

said. “I just came out there 

to compete. I have goals, but 

I definitely didn’t expect a 

51.7 split. That was crazy. I 

couldn’t believe that.”

On social media, neither 

could hundreds of thousands of 

new fans.
