Eight BAMN protesters arrested minutes into regents meeting

$2.72 billion 

raised for student 
support, research, 

other projects

GENEVIEVE HUMMER

In November 2013, the Uni-

versity launched the latest in 
a series of major fundraising 
campaigns. 
This 
initiative, 

called Victors for Michigan, 
set the largest goal of any fund-
raising campaign launched by a 
public institution of higher edu-
cation: $4 billion.

The University has already 

brought in more than half of 
its goal, with about $2.7 billion 
already raised since the cam-
paign started.

This is the third landmark 

fundraising campaign for the 
University. The first — the 
billion-dollar 
Campaign 
for 

Michigan — ran between 1991 
and 1997 and was the first bil-
lion-dollar campaign launched 

by a public school. Between that 
effort and Victors for Michigan 
was The Michigan Difference, 
which ran between 2000 and 
2008 and raised $3.2 billion.

Though campaigns refocus 

the energy of the University’s 
fundraisers, they do not alter 
the way money is accepted by 
the school. Donors still give to 
whichever college, department 
or program they choose, but any 
money donated within the offi-
cially denoted time frame for 
the campaign counts as money 
for the campaign.

Victors for Michigan set 

three specific funding goals: 
student support, engaged learn-
ing and “bold ideas.” These 
three objectives were decided 
following extensive planning 
meetings in 2011 including 
Jerry May, vice president for 
development, the deans of each 
school and a collection of stu-
dents. The $4 billion figure was 
derived from a compilation of 
the goals set by the individual 
colleges and schools, the Uni-
versity Health System and other 
non-degree granting units.

The goal is to raise $1 billion

Within 30 seconds of Univer-

sity President Mark Schlissel 
commencing the University’s 
Board of Regents meeting in 
the Michigan Union’s Ander-
son Room, protesters from By 
Any Means Necessary stormed 

the regents’ meeting table while 
shouting, “On-site admissions 
now; open up, or we’ll shut it 
down.”

Tables were displaced as the 

protesters ran forward, draw-
ing a response from Division 
of Public Safety and Security 
officers present at the meeting. 
Some protesters were tackled 
to the ground, handcuffed and 
escorted from the room.

Officers made eight arrests, 

one of which was a University 
student, according to DPSS 
spokesperson 
Diane 
Brown. 

Seven of these individuals, 
including the University stu-
dent, were adults who have 
been released pending an arrest 

warrant from the county pros-
ecutor. The eighth, a minor, has 
been transported to a juvenile 
detention center.

BAMN is a national coalition 

that works to defend affirma-
tive action, immigrant rights 
and equality. The University’s 
chapter of BAMN previously 
shut down a regents meeting in 
November, where they demand-
ed 
the 
University 
exercise 

on-site admissions at Detroit 
schools.

During that meeting, the 

regents relocated the session 
to the Fleming Administration 
Building.

BAMN had been threatening 

to shut down the regents meet-

ing throughout the week, hand-
ing out fliers across campus to 
advertise the pending demon-
stration.

As the police responded dur-

ing the event, one fallen pro-
tester yelled, “I can’t breathe.” 
Another screamed at the police 
to let her fellow protesters go.

Ultimately, all BAMN pro-

testers were expelled from the 
meeting, and those who were 
not arrested continued to pro-
test in the hallways of the Union 
adjacent to the Anderson Room.

Those remaining also yelled 

“Let them go” — perhaps in ref-
erence to the arrested protest-
ers.

The 
regularly 
scheduled 

regents meeting continued as 
planned after police escorted 
protesters out of the room.

In November, BAMN forced 

the regents to relocate their 
meeting by employing similar 
methods — demanding the Uni-
versity exercise on-site admis-
sions at Detroit schools and 
calling for the University to 
employ the “Texas Top 10 Per-
cent” admissions policy, which 
administrators have said would 
not be feasible for the Univer-
sity.

At the time, the board moved 

to a closed meeting in the Flem-
ing Administration Building for 
“public safety reasons,” raising 
questions about the Universi-

ty’s compliance with the Open 
Meetings Act.

In response to the Novem-

ber incident, the University 
strengthened 
security 
mea-

sures during the meetings, pri-
marily by staffing the meetings 
with uniformed DPSS officers 
as opposed to those wearing 
plainclothes. 
The 
meeting 

rooms were also equipped with 
security cameras and the tables 
were rearranged to prevent pro-
testers from approaching the 
regents’ table.

Additionally, a sign in the 

entrance to each regents meet-
ing now reads, “The Univer-
sity of Michigan recognizes the 

Giving Blue Day 
campaign aims 
to encourage 
philanthropy

By EMMA KINERY

Daily Staff Reporter

Though students may envi-

sion the average University 
donor as an established alum 
or wealthy adult, University 
development officers are trying 
to tap into a new constituency — 
students.

In December, Giving Blue-

day — a University fundraising 
event that generated more than 
$1 million during a 24-hour 
period — devoted special atten-
tion to reaching student donors.

For the last five years, the 

University has tracked data on 
how students donate, as well 
as their knowledge of how the 
University collects and uses 
funds, 
namely 
through 
an 

annual survey administered by 
the Office of Development.

This year, the questions 

on the survey access student 

awareness of University fun-
draising, the impact of small 
donations and ongoing develop-
ment events at the University 
— such as Giving Blueday and 
the University’s $4 billion fun-
draising campaign, Victors for 
Michigan.

Kat Walsh, director of stu-

dent engagement for the Office 
of Development, said the survey 
is important because it helps 
them identify specific areas of 
focus to prompt student dona-
tions.

“There’s 
a 
difference 

between saying ‘I’m aware of 
that and I don’t want to par-
ticipate’ and ‘I didn’t even know 
that that existed and I wish that 
I had,’ ” Walsh said.

Over the course of adminis-

tering the survey, Walsh said 
she’s found that more students 
see the value in small donations, 
such as a $20 gift. However, 
she said the data also points to 
room for improvement, includ-
ing educating students on the 
University’s status as a non 
profit institution. Walsh said 40 
percent of students believe the 
University is for profit.

Proportion of 
alumni donors 

declines, following 
academy-wide trend

By WILL GREENBERG 
and RACHEL PREMACK

Daily News Editor and 

Daily Staff Reporter

Following 
a 
multi-decade 

slide in state appropriations 
for higher education, Univer-
sity development officials are 
increasingly working to make 
up the difference with private 
donations.

State funding to public uni-

versities has decreased signifi-
cantly in the last few decades. 
In the 1970s, state funding 
accounted for roughly 75 per-
cent of the University’s operat-
ing budget. Today, that figure is 
16 percent.

Data from the University, as 

well as the Council for Aid to 
Education national survey, indi-
cate that the University is one of 
the top 20 fundraising schools 
in the country. Despite a dip in 

giving surrounding the 2008 
recession, total donations to 
the University have continued 
to increase over the past couple 
decades.

The University is currently 

in the middle of its sixth major 
fundraising campaign, called 
Victors for Michigan. Cam-
paigns are a period of redoubled 
fundraising efforts where the 
administration identifies spe-
cific areas that need funding. 
Those specific goals are used to 
advertise to donors and attract 
more giving.

As the University continues to 

bring in more donation dollars, 
it finds itself subject to many of 
the same trends faced by schools 
across the country that are also 
turning to private money.

Perhaps one of the most 

notable trends has been the 
transition from alumni donors 
to non-alumni donors. In fiscal 
year 2014, more than half of all 
the University’s donors were 
non-alumni.

Numbers provided by the 

University’s development office 
display this shift over the past 
five years. In FY 2010, 53.4 per-

She said the development team 

sees value in collecting the data 
because it helps them under-
stand ways to better inform 
students on the importance of 
philanthropy.

“We know that a lot of stu-

dents are unaware of the roles 
that private philanthropy plays at 
the University, and how private 
philanthropy impacts students 
experiences,” Walsh said. “It’s 
really important for us to under-
stand what students are aware 
of, what they’re not aware of, 
what their opinions are because 
it’s important to us to develop 
programming that will help ben-
efit students’ education and their 
involvement in philanthropy.”

During 
the 
Giving 
Blue 

Day fundraiser, students were 
encouraged to donate to Uni-
versity units, including student 
organizations, to receive match-
ing gifts from private donors. 
About 80 student organizations 
fundraised more than $157,000.

The top five fundraisers were 

Dance Marathon, the Michigan 
Marching Band, the Medical 

School’s Student-Run Free Clin-
ic, Alternative Spring Break and 
MUSIC Matters.

Though student donors may 

have been most prominently fea-
tured during Giving Blue Day, 
Walsh said student donors have 
long contributed to the Universi-
ty’s development efforts. Walsh’s 
job is to help student organiza-
tions fundraise, and in particu-
lar, help them appeal to potential 
student donors on campus.

“Donors range from under-

grad to doctoral students, and 
are representative of the vari-
ous passions that exist across the 
campus,” she said.

For many students, she said 

the incentive to donate stems 
from their interest in the work of 
the student organizations.

“Everyone can’t take care of 

patients themselves, but they can 
make a gift that will make that 
happen,” Walsh said. “They may 
not be able to go fix up houses in 
the inner city, but they can sup-
port an organization that can do 
that. That’s what all of our donors 
do: they make things happen, and 
our students realize that they 
can make things happen through 
philanthropy whether as donors 
or whether as fundraisers, and, 

in some cases, both.”

However, 
many 
organiza-

tions find it difficult to track the 
amount of student donations 
they receive each year because of 
the various ways that they raise 
money, in addition to the fact 
that most do not keep track of 
how much specifically students 
donate.

LSA junior Macauley Rybar, 

the external director of Dance 
Marathon, said the organization 
often faces a similar problem. 
Because of the way DMUM is set 
up, where dancers are personally 
responsible to meet an individual 
funding goal of $300, he said 
there is really no way to track 
who donates what amount.

In contrast, Giving Blueday 

provided them the unique oppor-
tunity to track donations because 
the student-donated funds were 
matched.

“The first time we received 

anything close to (trackable 
funds) was on Giving Blueday of 
this year, because we were able to 
track student donation due to the 
student matching funds avail-
able for student organizations,” 
Rybar said.

Some student organizations 

also allow students to donate 
directly to other students, as 
opposed to external causes or 
activities.

MUSIC 
Matters, 
founded 

in 2011, holds an annual char-
ity concert each year as well as 
SpringFest. Together, the events 
raise money to not only bring in 
popular artists, but to give back 
to various aspects of the Univer-
sity community.

In their first year, the group 

raised $10,000 to donate to Mott 
Children’s Hospital. In their sec-
ond year, they raised $50,000 to 
create a need-based scholarship 
for in-state students entering 
the University. For the past two 
years, the organization allocated 
donations toward the creation of 
a camp for underserved Detroit 
youth.

MUSIC 
Matters 
President 

Darren Appel, a Business senior, 
said the group employs a two-
tiered approach: continuing to 
support the scholarship, while 
also supporting a separate cause 
each year.

Closing ceremony 
features prayer of 
mourning, remarks 

from survior 

By ALYSSA BRANDON

Daily Staff Reporter

In honor of Yom HaShoah, the 

National Holocaust Remembrance 
Day, students gathered on the Diag 
on Wednesday and Thursday for 
an annual 24-hour reading of the 
names of those killed during the 
Holocaust.

Members of Hillel’s Conference 

on the Holocaust invited passersby 
to read quotes from several Holo-
caust survivors while student vol-
unteers read a number of victims’ 
names every hour.

The event also featured a special 

ceremony Wednesday evening, in 
which student volunteers sang tra-
ditional Hebrew songs and prayers. 
Students who attended the cer-
emony also lit six candles in honor 
of the 6 million Jews killed during 
the Holocaust.

Two COTH volunteers addition-

ally shared stories of family mem-

bers who survived the Holocaust. 
LSA freshman Shira Kitay, COTH’s 
assistant survivor relations chair, 
shared her grandfather’s story, 
involving how he and his fam-
ily went into hiding after the Nazi’s 
invaded Poland.

“My grandfather barely evaded 

death in so many instances,” she 
said during the ceremony. “His 
story is one of strength, persever-
ance and a lot of luck.”

In an interview following the 

event, Kitay said talking about the 
Holocaust is important in keeping 
the testimonies of survivors alive.

“The Holocaust is the biggest 

failure of humanity,” she said. “It’s 
important to carry on these stories, 
especially since we are the last gen-
eration that will hear them from 
survivors.”

Kitay also said talking about her 

grandfather’s struggle is a way for 
her to honor his determination to 
survive.

“He suffered through all that so 

we could have a family,” she said. 
“I’m here today because my grand-
father persevered. I would not be 
alive if he had given up.”

In the closing ceremony of the 

vigil Thursday afternoon, Holo-
caust survivor Irene Butter spoke to 

students about ongoing Holocaust 
Remembrance projects in Europe.

Butter, who is also a profes-

sor emerita in the School of Public 
Health, was 12 years old when she 
was taken from her home in the 
Netherlands and sent to work in 
two concentration camps. She was 
14 when she was liberated.

During the ceremony, Butter 

stressed the importance of honor-
ing the lives lost during the Holo-
caust.

“When these people were mur-

dered, they were not given a proper 
burial, and their names and iden-
tities were lost,” she said. “We 
depend on you, the future genera-
tions, to tell these stories and read 
the names.”

In an interview after the cere-

mony, Butter said she returns to the 
University to share her story and 
teach the younger generations les-
sons from the Holocaust.

“It’s not just important that they 

learned what happened, but it’s 
important that they also learn the 
lessons,” she said. “You can’t be a 
bystander, because we have to be 
vigilant about stopping and pre-
venting discrimination and oppres-
sion any types of inequality because 
people are all the same.”

Students hold vigil on Diag for 
Holocaust Remembrance Day

LSA juniors Michelle Shumunow and Polina Fradkin read a prayer at Conference on the Holocaust’s annual Reading of the 
Names ceremony on the Diag Wednesday evening. 

cent of the 103,753 donors giving 
less than $25,000 were alumni; last 
year only 44.6 percent of the 119,168 
donors were alumni. This is signifi-
cant given the fact that the majority 
of donors give within this range.

Additionally, over the past decade 

the University’s alumni participation 
rate has declined. While total dona-
tions have continued to rise, the per-
centage of alumni that donate each 
year decreased from 15.2 percent in 
2005 to 9.9 percent in 2014.

Michigan is not alone in this trend. 

In fact, nearly all schools in the Big 
Ten have seen a decrease in alumni 
participation since 2004, with the 
average dropping from 13.8 percent to 
10.1 percent over 10 years.

Megan Doud, director of the Uni-

versity’s Annual Giving program, 
spends most of her time looking at 
these numbers. Doud explained that 
the University has focused more 
attention on groups affiliated with 
the University who are not necessar-
ily alumni. In particular, individuals 
tied to non-degree granting units — 

such as the hospital, libraries, botani-
cal gardens and others — have been 
an increasing source of funds.

“A shift to broader perspective on 

population and then more emphasis 
on these areas that are really more 
community-based, or almost more 
like a separate nonprofit even though 
they’re from the University of Michi-
gan, has really increased that non-
alumni support,” she said.

Tom Baird, assistant vice presi-

dent of development and campaign 
strategy, said some donors within 
that category are also attracted to the 
“marketable” work done at the hospi-
tal. The prospect of curing a disease 
is particularly enticing to donors, he 
said, and is able to attract donors with 
little prior connection to the Univer-
sity.

“Research is huge,” Baird said. 

“People make gifts to help facilitate 
patient care; there’s a whole variety of 
things people can give to.”

Doud added that this year’s Giving 

Blue Day also played a large role in 
donation totals for the year.

Of course, alumni still provide a 

large portion of the donation base. 
Of the University’s total alumni, 

46.3 percent have given at least once 
in their lifetime. Of those who have 
donated, 39.9 percent live in Michi-
gan. California holds the next larg-
est group of donating alumni with 
8.17 percent; Illinois has 5.52 percent, 
New York 4.77 percent and Florida 
3.42 percent. By region, the North-
east holds 18.15 percent of donating 
alumni, the West 15.41 percent.

Additionally, according to Judy 

Malcolm, senior director of executive 
communications in the Office of Uni-
versity Development, the University 
has a 70 percent donor retention rate 
— meaning 70 percent of donors from 
the previous year gave again. Malcom 
said this is the highest retention rate 
in the Big Ten.

Further examination of the Uni-

versity’s donation data by the Daily 
shows the school ranks among the 
highest in the country in terms of 
total dollars raised. Since 2004, the 
earliest year data was available from 
CAE, the University’s alumni dona-
tion totals has placed it in the top 20 
amounts of all colleges, except for 
2011.

The University’s donations have 

increased by almost 71 percent since 

2004, whereas the median donation 
total for the top 20 has increased by 
61 percent.

Ann E. Kaplan, the Voluntary Sup-

port of Education survey director 
of CAE, said while alumni partici-
pation is generally declining across 
the country, average gift sizes are 
increasing — this year by 7 percent.

Kaplan said public institutions are 

increasingly joining the ranks as top 
fundraisers. She added that while 
public universities have had to catch 
up to private schools, which have his-
torically relied more on philanthropy 
for funding, all large schools have the 
capacity to become top-tier fundrais-
ers.

“A lot of the increase in giving 

in this particular year was due to a 
resurgence of major gifts for positions 
of wealth,” Kaplan said. “So that’s 
where you might see fewer donors 
but you’ll see more contributions at 
greater values.”

The Daily’s data analysis focuses 

on 2013, the latest available year. The 
University was 14th highest in dona-
tions that year, bringing in more than 
$351 million. To understand how dif-

for student support — financial 
aid, 
scholarships, 
fellowships, 

internships and travel funding. 
The University already directs 
considerable funds toward stu-
dent support. During the 2013-
2014 academic year alone, the 
University awarded more than 
$900 million in financial aid to 
32,133 students. So far, $450 mil-
lion has been raised for scholar-
ships alone during the Victors for 
Michigan campaign.

A number of factors make it 

difficult to predict exactly where 
that money will go. For one, most 
donors specify exactly what spe-
cific school, program or fund they 
want their money going toward. 
Further, many donations are paid 
over a period of time, meaning the 
University might not receive the 
full amount for several years.

For their part, the students 

have been involved in Victors for 
Michigan since the beginning. 
During the campaign’s original 
planning, 
a 
student 
commit-

tee joined the deans and other 
administrators to help craft the 
campaign’s three goals.

Like the fundraising campaign, 

the Central Student Government 
has also worked to provide student 
support during the past year. For-
mer CSG President Bobby Dishell, 
a Public Policy senior, attempted 
to fund a LEAD scholarship — 
a merit-based scholarship for 
minority students — through the 
Alumni Association in the fall. 
The effort ultimately fell through 
because of Proposal 2 restrictions 
in Michigan, which prevent the 
school from giving scholarships 
based on race.

Still, recently elected CSG 

President Cooper Charlton, an 
LSA junior, said he wants to work 
closely with administrators to 
pursue other creative avenues to 
increase student support. Charl-
ton said he plans to learn more 
about 
fundraising 
and 
work 

closely with administration on 
this issue.

“Are we creatively thinking 

of different ways to find scholar-
ships, to decrease tuition? Yes; 
kind of one of those longer con-
versations I will be having over 
the summer to really, really nail 
down some target ideas,” Charl-
ton said.

In addition to student support, 

another goal of the campaign is 
to attract donations for faculty 
research. To that end, deans of 
each school have been market-
ing their research projects to 
potential donors as part of the 
campaign. These projects are 
generating interest even among 

non-alumni donors — a group 
that, in recent years, has grown 
larger in number than the alumni 
donor base.

Deborah 
Loewenberg 
Ball, 

dean of the School of Education, 
said she wants funding for the 
school’s work in improving K-12 
education in the state and else-
where. Programs like the Center 
for Education, Design, Elevation 
& Research have attracted the 
support of non-alumni, Ball said, 
and people are excited to see the 
results the School of Education 
can produce.

“It’s been a moment, I think, of 

opportunity for people working 
in education that there are people 
interested in giving money,” she 
said.

James Woolliscroft, dean of the 

Medical School, and Dave Mun-
son, dean of Engineering, said 
because faculty of both schools 
work so closely on research, nei-
ther of them mind which of the 
two schools donors give to since 
it’s all going to the same place. 
This notion resulted in a fund-
raising partnership between the 
College of Engineering and the 
Medical School

“Maybe it’s in an account 

that’s controlled by engineering, 
maybe it’s in an account that’s 
controlled by medicine, maybe it’s 
in an account that’s controlled by 
the vice president for research,” 
Munson said. “We don’t really 
care as long as it in some way ben-
efits our faculty and our students 
and I think it’s a somewhat new 
way of thinking about this.”

“Dave and I did a little presen-

tation to literally a room full of 
interested attendees and donors. 
One of the stories told was about 
the tracheal splint,” Woolliscroft 
said, referring to the 3-D printed 
device used to save a baby’s life 
two summers ago. “It’s that sort 
of thing that’s very real, very pow-
erful and can’t be done by either 
school alone.”

The Medical School has also 

worked closely with UMHS in its 
fundraising efforts. Tom Baird, 
who serves as the interim asso-
ciate vice president for medical 
development and alumni rela-
tions, said the hospital is a major 
attraction for non-alumni donors. 
He said a large portion of the 
donor base comes from former 
patients hoping to give back to the 
hospital after treatment.

“You have grateful patients 

where they had a family member, 
or friend, or some type of rela-
tionship where the health system 
helped them and they just feel so 
strongly about the care that they 
received that they want to make a 
gift to support that area,” he said.

The Victors for Michigan cam-

paign relies on a broad network 

of volunteers and donors. Volun-
teers are charged with hosting 
fundraising events, participating 
in campaign meetings and advo-
cating for the University’s initia-
tives, among other tasks.

University alum Mary Petro-

vich wrote in an e-mail that she 
has participated in a wide range 
of volunteer activities.

“I have been involved in possi-

bly the deepest and most diverse 
sets of activities of any volunteer 
in terms of my time and money,” 
she wrote. “I currently serve as a 
member of the President’s Advi-
sory Council, but that is the tip of 
the iceberg.”

Petrovich has donated funds to 

support the construction of a new 
mechanical engineering building 
and an engineering scholarship 
and recruiting program, as well 
as the softball and men’s basket-
ball locker rooms. She plans to 
support projects to improve gas-
troenterology care in the coming 
year.

“Michigan means so much 

more to me as the springboard 
for my success given the under-
privileged background that I 
came from and the confidence 
I derived from my four years of 
success at Michigan,” she wrote. 
“My life has been enriched by the 
many lessons that I have learned 
in the classroom and on the play-
ing field. Those experiences have 
been priceless and formidable 
building blocks to my career suc-
cess.”

University 
alums 
Laura 

McTaggart and Tom Nolan, cam-
paign volunteers who each earned 
graduate degrees from other uni-
versities, wrote in an e-mail their 
undergraduate experience at the 
University motivated them to 
support the Victors for Michigan 
campaign.

“Michigan plays a much bigger 

role in our philanthropy because 
for us, the undergraduate experi-
ence was so important and life-
changing,” they wrote. “We are 
strong believers in public edu-
cation and the mission of great 
public schools. In addition, our 
graduate school experiences did 
not include watching football and 
singing a rousing fight song every 
Saturday surrounded by over 
100,000 like-minded souls. That’s 
the community we want to stay a 
part of.”

McTaggart and Nolan cited the 

need to improve the affordability 
of higher education as their moti-
vation for getting involved with 
the campaign.

“We want to help students 

afford 
college, 
period,” 
they 

wrote. “We both had help getting 
through school and this is our 
way of paying that back.” 

right of dissent, but we also rec-
ognize the right of speakers to 
be heard.”

“I certainly respect the right 

of the group to speak up and tell 
us their opinion about some-
thing important,” Schlissel said 
in an interview with The Michi-
gan Daily after the November 
meeting. “I’m disappointed that 
they chose to disrupt the meet-
ing, but we were able to conduct 
the business of the University in 
this separate venue as needed.”

Toward the end of the Thurs-

day’s regents meeting, both 
Schlissel 
and 
a 
number 
of 

regents expressed their frustra-
tion with the protest.

Regent Mark Bernstein (D), 

who previously served as the 
chair of the Michigan Civil 
Rights Commission and helped 
established the Michigan Civil 

Rights Academy, said the protest 
did a disservice to the cause of 
diversity on campus.

“On a personal level, I am 

deeply frustrated and disap-
pointed in some of our students 
and other people, not because it 
was moderately disruptive, but 
because they are so misguided 
and damaging an important 
cause,” he said.

Black undergraduate enroll-

ment at the University has 
hovered around 4 percent in 
recent years. Aside from BAMN, 
other groups have lobbied for 
increased diversity on campus. 
In January 2014, members of 
the University’s Black Student 
Union called on the University to 
address undergraduate minority 
enrollment, among other issues. 
In addition to campus activism, 
the BSU has opted to work with 
administrators 
to 
implement 

changes, whereas BAMN has 
largely focused on protest. In 
November, E. Royster Harper, 

vice president for student life, 
said BAMN had not attempted 
to schedule a meeting with Uni-
versity officials.

Regent Andrea Fischer New-

man (R) said she, too, was disap-
pointed in the protest and added 
that 
BAMN’s 
demonstration 

turned the narrative away from 
important issues.

“I don’t think rushing the 

table and storming the meeting 
helps make the point,” she said 
in an interview after the meet-
ing.

Schlissel echoed this sen-

timent, calling for construc-
tive dialogue and plugging the 
launch of a University-wide 
diversity plan. Schlissel has said 
he plans to announce details in 
the fall.

“I hope we continue to work 

together to construct some civil 
discourse 
and 
constructive 

action,” he said. “The Univer-
sity’s commitment to diversity 
does not waver.”

ferent factors correlate with 
donations, the analysis com-
pares donations with each of 
the 20 college’s U.S. News and 
World Report rankings, holis-
tic sports ranking and student 
body.

One area lacking variance 

was academic prestige; almost 
all schools on this list are 
renowned for their scholastic 
and research excellence. U.S. 
News and World Report rank-
ing of each school was measured 
to assess the school’s academic 
quality. These rankings account 
for 
undergraduate 
academic 

reputation, student retention, 
faculty quality and other fea-
tures.

Being a top-20 fundraiser 

puts the University among the 
company of schools with higher 
academic rankings. The median 
U.S. News ranking for a top 20 
donor school in 2013 was 14, 
comparable to Cornell or North-
western. The University is 29th 
— the 15th lowest among the top 
20 donors.

Most schools with lower aca-

demic rankings were in the bot-
tom half of the top 20 list. Six of 
the top 10 donor schools were 
also in the top 10 of U.S. News 
rankings — such as Harvard 
University and the University of 
Pennsylvania — while only two 
of the bottom 10 schools were in 
U.S. News’ top 10.

Finally, notable differences 

exist among public and private 
colleges. Eight public schools 
were on the top 20 list, and all 
were in the bottom 10. Their U.S. 
News and World Report median 
score was lower, and their ath-
letic score tended to be higher. 
The median public school dona-
tion in 2013 amounted to $338 
million as opposed to $490 mil-
lion for private schools.

Among public schools, the 

University’s donation amount in 
2013 was 4 percent higher than 
the median public school, but 28 
percent lower than the median 
private school amount.

That could signify that the 

University, despite its lowered 
state appropriations, still has 
more in common with pub-
lic rather than private schools 
when it comes to funding.

As state funds have experi-

enced declines over the past 
couple decades, the Univer-
sity has had to reevaluate the 
role of state and private money. 
Still, Jerry May, vice president 
for development, said while it’s 
“conceivable that for some rea-
son (the University) decides to 
‘go private’ ” somewhere down 
the line, there is no point in 
exploring that route right now. 
He said the idea was discussed 
decades ago, but is not a topic 
today.

May 
explained 
that 
any 

money coming from a source 
like donations can be used to 
help fund operating costs like 
scholarships, which frees up 

state funding for other areas. 
The state of Michigan currently 
only provides 16 percent of the 
University’s general fund bud-
get, which May described as an 
unrestricted endowment.

Malcolm said the University 

would need an additional $700 
million added to the current 
$9.7 billion endowment to off-
set the loss of state funding if it 
were to indeed go private.

May said the reason private 

money has become so important 
is because of the University’s 
increased efforts to provide 
scholarships. He said schol-
arships should help slow the 
increases in tuition rates, and 
that the University has made a 
dent in that effort over the past 
few years.

“We put our first amount of 

money on in-state tuition for 
in-state students. We now can 
guarantee that we will meet 
the need of an in-state student,” 
May 
said. 
“We’re 
probably 

$12,000 short per-student to be 
able to meet the need of an out-
of-state student.”

Still, May said, given the sta-

tus of state appropriations and 
the financial goals of the Uni-
versity, the development office 
will be full steam ahead for the 
foreseeable future.

“We will always need build-

ings, we will always need to 
replace buildings,” May said. 
“We will always have new pro-
gram ideas and technology will 
change us so that we’re teaching 
you something different.”

“When you endow a scholar-

ship at U of M, the money you 
donate goes into the invest-
ment fund at the University, 
and the interest made off of that 
gets donated each year,” Appel 
said. “The first year will be just 
one student, but our plan long-
term is to keep donating. We’ll 
have a major cause each year 
for the concert, but then as we 
keep growing and making more 
money, we can keep dumping 
money into the fellowship each 
year, so it will keep growing.”

However, regardless of fam-

ily wealth, many students report 
finding themselves without extra 
money to donate.

First-year 
Medical 
student 

Molly Laux, who heads outreach 
and public relations for the Stu-
dent-Run Free Clinic, said the 
donations are even more mean-
ingful when students with limit-
ed funds still choose to give back.

“Even when they are small 

donations, we feel really privi-
leged to receive them,” she said. 
“I think that because of that, 
it makes us work very hard to 
make sure that student voices are 
heard in things that we do, and 
for that we always try to make 
sure that we can keep as many 
volunteer positions open as pos-
sible, get as many students in. 
We bring students in as inter-
preters sometimes. We under-
stand that when students do give 
us that extra money that they 
maybe saved for a few days or a 
few weeks, that we really do our 
best to make sure that we can do 
something in return.”

Laux added that by donating 

their time as well, students have 
an enhanced chance to see the 
importance of their contributions.

“When the students are able 

to come in and kind of see where 
their money goes, they can see 
our patients and see how grate-
ful they are for the services that 
we provide,” Lauz said. Not 
only does that make them feel 
proud of the donation that they 
originally gave, but I think that 
gives them a greater incentive to 
donate more when they can.”

Most donations to the Stu-

dent-Run Free Clinic go toward 
renting out the space for their 
medical center; the rest funds 
equipment, 
medications 
and 

other supplies.

The 
organization 
raised 

$13,528 on Giving Blueday. Laux 
said she attributed much of 
that to the work of the Office of 
Development, noting the ability 
to work both with Walsh’s team 
and another specifically for med-
ical students.

“They’ve been such a great 

help,” Laux said. “(They) helped 
me figure out what the best ways 
of strategizing the posts, and she 
helped me find personal stories 
we could use, and helped me 
find the most effective means 
of transmitting information in 
time, drawing attention to our 
e-mails. They were completely 
fantastic.”

Business senior Kimberly Cui, 

finance and fundraising team 
leader for Alternative Spring 
Break, also noted the advantag-
es of having access to Office of 
Development resources.

“(Walsh) and her team are def-

initely really helpful,” she said. 
“They’re really open to meet up 
with even student organizations 
about fundraising ideas and kind 
of the best way to fundraise. 
We’re definitely hoping to work 
more with them in the future.”

MUSIC Matters also works 

closely with the Office of Devel-
opment.

“Our model is more teaching 

students how to fundraise as a 
whole,” Appel said. “We do a lot 
of fundraising at the University, 
we reach out to corporate spon-
sors, we have a lot of students 
learning how to make a pitch 
book, learning how to present an 
idea to a corporation, things like 
that.”

In the future, Walsh said her 

team is interested in continu-
ing to work with organizations 
through initiatives like Giving 
Blueday. In this year’s version of 
the annual student survey, two 
questions were added specifi-
cally on Giving Blueday with the 

aim of improving involvement 
next year.

In addition, University rep-

resentatives met with student 
organizations to garner feedback 
after the event.

“What we learned from our 

sessions with student orgs was 
they thought the energy of the 
day was really great,” Walsh 
said. “They felt that the training 
and the resources that we pro-
vided was really great, and they 
loved the challenges. Some of the 
things they felt we could improve 
on are, for instance, making sure 
that our training is available 
online, because they come and 
attend and they want to share it 
with members of their organiza-
tions.”

Cui also noted the importance 

of students developing a habit of 
donating early on.

“For us, it’s almost more 

important that students are giv-
ing,” Cui said. “We really value 
their donation, because when 
you start while you’re in college, 
you really care about the issue, 
you want to be active about that 
issue in the community. So for 
us, starting young, it shows that 
you’re passionate about the issue, 
you’re empowered to support 
programs that you believe in, 
and then we also believe that if 
you start now, the likelihood that 
you’ll continue to be involved in 
the future is a lot higher.”

Cui said the majority of ASB 

funds go toward the vehicles that 
are used on the trip, but the funds 
are also used to cover housing for 
volunteers as well as gas.

Appel said student donations 

not only play an important role 
in University development, but 
also provide chances for students 
to contribute to the University 
community.

“As a whole, there’s a really 

great opportunity for students 
too,” he said. “It doesn’t matter 
how much they donate, but being 
able to donate and give to a cause, 
I think it’s important for the Uni-
versity and it just leaves people 
with a good feeling.”

O

n April 11, New York Times 
columnist 
David 
Brooks 

wrote a piece called “The 

Moral 
Bucket 

List.” In it, he 
alludes 
to 
the 

unfulfilling 
nature of exter-
nal achievement. 
In other words, 
career 
success, 

recognition 
and 

money 
have 

afforded him little 
depth 
of 
spirit. 

The timing of this 
piece feels oddly perfect in that, as a 
senior embarking upon who knows 
what, I find myself incapable of defin-
ing what I want success to mean. Suc-
cess is subjective, but as we know it, 
it is defined by environment. And I 
can say, having been in a university 
environment for four years, that suc-
cess in this environment is defined in 
terms of external achievement.

I believe that in order to achieve 

personal success, a success defined 
by you and only you, you must dis-
tance yourself from preconceptions, 
from the notion that to be happy is 
to be the best. What I’ll pose now 
is a distillation of life advice I’ve 
absorbed from friends, family, teach-
ers, books and from myself in times 
of needed self-assurance. Hopefully, 
what this compilation of both gener-
ic and what I believe to be original 
advice will do, is remind you that the 
formation of a good and honest self is 
what will aid you in your definition 
of success. And that success, the kind 
that comes from the inside, as Brooks 
suggests, is the kind that makes you 
happy. Maybe not happy as we know 
it, but happy in deeper terms. Happy 
to be living. Worthy of our lives.

1) You are not special.
I have to say, I don’t like this 

one. I’m sure you have heard it 
before and have decided that it 
doesn’t apply to you because you 
are, in fact, special. Well, that’s 
just the point. You are special, 
and so am I, and so is your neigh-
bor, and so is your super annoying 
classmate. We’re all special in our 
own rights, and therefore none of 
us are. Our grandparents’ genera-
tion was taught to think that they 
were just cogs in a machine, and 
we, unlike that generation, have 
been taught to think that sunshine 
comes out of our asses. In the crud-
est of terms, you have to make the 

sunshine spill out of your ass. Spe-
cialness isn’t inherent. Talent can 
be, intelligence certainly is, but it 
doesn’t make one special. Special 
implies that you’re more deserv-
ing, which you aren’t. It’s because 
we have opportunity and live in an 
insulated bubble that we think of 
ourselves as special. But I can say 
from the experience I have had vol-
unteering within prisons, a forgot-
ten place, that the people inside are 
truly special. They are as special as 
my friends, my family — maybe not 
to me but to their own families and 
to themselves.

2) As flies to wanton boys are 

we to th’ gods. They kill us for 
their sport.

Thanks to John Rubadeau for 

introducing me to this quote and to 
William Shakespeare for writing it. 
Its meaning — that life happens for 
no other reason than that it does — 
is something I sit with often. Shitty 
things will happen to us in our lives. 
Shitty things have happened to us. 
But to dwell on those things, to con-
stantly terrorize ourselves over the 
whys, is to miss out on time. All we 
can do is accept our stories, have our 
traumas become parts of our identi-
ties and move on without question-
ing our pasts, rather letting them 
shape us in ways we wouldn’t have 
necessarily imagined for ourselves.

3) Stop feeling guilt over your 

privilege.

This advice is intended for my 

peers in the social justice world who 
so badly want to be good that they in 
fact put themselves and others down 
in the process. Privilege is a buzz-
word of the time, but for good reason 
— it has prompted severe racial and 
social inequalities universally. How-
ever, we have made privilege mean 
something bad, when it by definition 
means advantage. It’s not that we 
should wish to be disadvantaged, but 
rather wish advantages for everyone. 
We therefore don’t need to feel guilt 
about our own situations of privilege, 
constantly putting ourselves and oth-
ers down due to our class and race 
based situations. Rather, we should 
fight for those who don’t have those 
same privileges, so that race and 
class no longer harbor such extreme 
weight. If you are white, you’re 
white. If you come from wealth, you 
did. You can’t relinquish your past or 
your identity because you’re embar-
rassed or guilty. However, you can 
work toward a world in which those 

identities don’t create unjust barriers 
for others.

4) Be alone.
Don’t jump into relationships just 

because. Don’t constantly seek out 
company because you don’t want to 
sit with your own thoughts. Those 
thoughts will be the ones that make 
you understand what you need from 
a partner or a friend. If you don’t 
know yourself before being with 
someone, you’ll never know your-
self. And settling right now is no 
option at all. It’s like the Michigan 
winter causing you to appreciate the 
summer so much more. Being alone, 
at least for some time, will make you 
appreciate the benefits of real love, 
like a beautiful, perfect summer that 
needs waiting for.

5) Don’t define yourself or 

anyone else by the worst thing 
you’ve ever done or the worst 
thing about you. 

Recently, when discussing incar-

ceration with a group of thoughtful, 
kind people, one woman said about 
incarcerated people: “Why are they 
defined by the worst thing they’ve 
ever done? We aren’t.” It was reve-
latory. I have been working with 
incarcerated populations for over 
two years, and I hadn’t been able 
to articulate that thought so suc-
cinctly. It’s revelatory because no 
one should be defined by the worst 
thing they’ve done, and this is 
because we don’t measure ourselves 
by that same standard. We naturally 
define ourselves by our best quali-
ties. But to define others by their 
worst qualities, sometimes a natural 
inclination, is to make the playing 
field uneven. You can’t judge some-
one by their worst qualities and by 
the worst things they’ve ever done 
while judging yourself by your best 
qualities and the best things you’ve 
ever done. Instead, we should define 
ourselves and everyone around us

I hope that one of these points 

speaks to just one of you, even if just 
for a moment. These abstract, life-
style choices won’t make you a living 
or find you a passion. But perhaps if 
you follow one of these guidelines, 
intended to quiet the self, you’ll 
start to understand what you define 
as success. And that will give you 
peace, I believe. As it goes, I’m still 
waiting for it, but it’s coming.

You have seen the images and heard the 

stories. You may have liked these posts or 
posted a few statuses of your own. Unbe-
knownst to you, you’re supporting a dehu-
manizing production — the exploitation of 
human narratives, the perpetuation of suf-
fering, the continuation of neo-colonialism — 
the white-savior industrial complex.

I entered a community that was not my 

own without invitation. I “helped” myself to 
the people — bought more kente cloth than 
my bag could hold, ate more jollof than I 
could actually stomach and cried for every 
child I deemed neglected, impoverished or 
underprivileged. I was the unconscious and 
yet unconscionable oppressor; ignorant to the 
way I imposed my beliefs on the community I 
desired to help. I had honest intentions, truly, 
but I didn’t fully understand the history of 
humanitarian aid and development like I do 
now. I am now beginning to see the correla-
tion and resulting parallels between histori-
cal Western aid programs in the Global South 
and my own summer trip.

The staging of voluntourism images is 

reminiscent of colonial photography. Melanie 
Tanielian, a human rights scholar, discussed 
the dangers of colonial images and their 
attempt to convey “the scope of humanitar-
ian activity on the ground.” She argued that 
human aid has turned abstract bodies into 
a nameless source and only particular indi-
viduals have the privilege of being named. 
The same framework is present in images 
uploaded by volunteers. How many uploaded 
photos include the names of all photo partici-
pants? Think of the children who go nameless 
— leaving only their eyes to speak. Why must 
they continue to go unacknowledged? Just 
as Tanielian demonstrated colonial photog-
raphy was no more than a way to “show the 
scope of humanitarian activity, provide facts 
and figures, and fulfill the body count,” the 
voluntourism pictures are harmful, demoral-
izing and full of misplaced sympathies.

There’s a great and urgent need for mil-

lennials to understand the perpetuation 
of damaging and dangerous depictions of 
“African life.” Playing the savior destroys 
the agency and autonomy of those you are 

attempting to help. Carrie Kahn’s NPR 
article, “As Voluntourism Explodes, Who Is 
It Helping Most?” presents an alternative 
perspective. She mentions, “More and more 
Americans are no longer taking a few weeks 
off to suntan and sightsee abroad. Instead 
they’re working in orphanages, building 
schools and teaching English.”

She cites an estimated 1.6 million volunteer 

tourists are spending about $2 billion dollars 
on this new traveling trend. For recent gradu-
ates, the voluntourism industry is great for 
establishing a foundation in aid organiza-
tions and obtaining relevant work experience 
to add to graduate applications and resumes. 
However, servicing a community has to go 
further than temporary fixes and shallow 
promises. Ask yourself, is a five-day, 10-day 
or 14-day trip creating self-sustaining mod-
els of development that can be implemented 
in multiple settings? Furthermore, consider 
the space you occupy and the power you have 
within your assigned tasks. For example, 
when you impose your language on a non-
native speaker or train locals to adminis-
ter medical treatment in a way influenced 
by Western-centric ideals, you’re being an 
aggressor. You are inflating your self-worth 
while simultaneously conflating many of the 
complex problems faced by African nations 
into one singular, problematic image. This 
behavior must stop.

To those who fail to see the voluntourism 

industry’s dangerous connection to neo-colo-
nialism, I offer you this: I was once someone 
who didn’t understand the politics of speech, 
imagery and power in this setting. I was 
naïve — looking to do good, not exactly know-
ing how. Yet, I now adhere to the old saying, 
“Leave something better than you found it.” 
Ron Krabill, author of “American Sentimen-
talism and the Production of Global Citizens”, 
clarifies that, “The White Savior Industrial 
Complex is not about justice. It is about hav-
ing a big emotional experience that validates 
privilege.” Use your privilege to inform oth-
ers of all the joys of Africa, a beautiful con-
tinent of 54 diverse nations, each with a rich 
history and culture. Tell your friends of the 
scenery, weather, music and food. Educate 
them on culture, community and the kind-
ness of strangers. But please, in all that you 
do, leave your camera at home.

JAYLA JOHNSON | VIEWPOINT

Africa isn’t a spectator sport

SAM MYERS | VIEWPOINT

Michael Brown. Eric Garner. Now Walter 

Scott. With yet another instance in which a 
white police officer has killed an unarmed 
Black man, and amid growing concerns about 
racial tensions between citizens and police and 
the Department of Justice’s report that found 
the Ferguson Police Department to be guilty 
of sustaining systemic racism, it is safe to say 
that we have reached a crisis in our country. 
Simply put, on average, we have overwhelm-
ingly white police departments in charge of 
protecting communities of color. But they don’t 
seem to be doing much protecting.

As an undergraduate here, I took courses in 

American history and Black studies primar-
ily. My thesis was on the 1967 Detroit “riot.” 
I put quotation marks around “riot,” because 
my research concluded that the civil unrest 
and violence in 1967 transpired because of 
police agitation and abuse, and longstand-
ing racial divides and hostility between the 
95 percent white department and the more 
than 50 percent Black citizenry. This is a view 
shared by many in the fields of Black studies 
and American (especially Detroit) history. In 
fact, Illinois Gov. Otto Kerner and the other 
10 members of the investigative commission, 
whom President Lyndon Johnson charged 
with understanding the bloody conflict in 
Detroit, initially forwarded this view in 1967. 
The racial divide in Detroit, between the 
white police officers with guns and the Black 
citizens generally without them, was potent 
enough to cause a conflict that resulted in tens 
of deaths and millions of dollars in damage.

The police department in Ferguson is dis-

proportionately white. According to The New 
York Times, the police department in North 
Charleston is 80 percent white while the 
population there is 47 percent Black. Histori-
cally speaking, it is not all that surprising that 
there are instances of extreme violence in 
these places. The fact that this has continued, 
more than 50 years after the Kerner Commis-
sion pointed out this problem, is incredibly 
difficult to stomach.

What are we to do? First, it is probably 

best to have this discussion and to point 
out the consistencies in these police-caused 
conflicts. Hopefully, that can bring about an 
effort to construct police departments that 

more accurately reflect the constituencies 
that they’re intended to protect. Police need 
to be familiar with and respectful of their 
communities — not afraid, like Eric Garner’s 
killers admitted to being. There must be more 
of an emphasis on community policing. But 
second, and because that first movement will 
take a long time to implement (assuming peo-
ple are on board), it is important that we learn 
to assess, criticize and hold accountable our 
police departments.

Evident in the endless acquittals and not-

guilty verdicts in Garner and Brown’s cases 
— don’t forget that George Zimmerman was 
found not guilty — the police simply have too 
much power with too little oversight. And 
really, who can hold the police accountable? 
I’ve had interactions with police, and during 
them all I’ve felt totally powerless and at the 
mercy of someone who clearly felt superior 
and like he had total authority over me. I can 
only imagine what it must be like to be a Black 
man interacting with a white police officer. 
Not only do the police assume authority and 
superiority over Black people — especially 
men — but they assume legal use of lethal 
force with impunity. Walter Scott’s case, for 
which the police officer is charged with mur-
der, is an exception for now — we shall see 
what verdict comes — but there is too much 
evidence on the other hand.

And people continually and unequivocally 

come to the defense of police departments in 
this country, as if they, the ones with guns, 
are the people in danger, and not the people, 
overwhelmingly Black, who are shot and 
killed daily it now seems. Police do take great 
risks in their jobs, but it increasingly seems 
that they are not more at risk than people. 
There are no police for the police, only we, 
the people. If we do not speak up against 
police misdeeds — which are often criminal 
misdeeds — and wrest some of the power that 
they hold, then instances like these will con-
tinue. If they continue, it will not only be a 
blemish in the history of the United States, 
but it will be a piece of evidence in the argu-
ment that our great nation is descending into 
the likes of a police state.

Don’t be afraid to criticize the police

I

lost my last good pair of head-
phones the other day.

I don’t really know where 

they went. At one 
point they were 
in my ears, and 
then in my pocket 
along 
with 
my 

phone and then 
at a later moment 
in neither place. I 
might have kicked 
them under my 
bed accidentally. 
Maybe left them 
somewhere on a table in the Law 
Library. If you’re currently reading 
this while listening to music through 
some black Klipsch earbuds, then 
they are mine and you should prob-
ably give them back to me.

I didn’t even notice I had lost 

them until I stepped outside to walk 
to class, went to go plug the invis-
ible headphones into my phone in 
my sleepless stupor and then real-
ized that my hands were grasping 
at nothing and I should probably 
go to bed before three in the morn-
ing. I had another pair lying around 
somewhere, but they went through 
the wash sometime in the past and 
I wasn’t really in the mood to listen 
to music playing into only my left 
ear. So I embarked on the journey 
to class without anything in my 
ears, and immediately noticed the 
unnerving silence.

I’ve grown up with portable music 

players as a normal part of my life. The 
iPod was released when I was in ele-

mentary school, and I still remember 
standing at my safety guard post at 
the street corner before school listen-
ing in awe on my friend’s new iPod to 
the entire album of Songs About Jane 
as my friend endlessly showed off how 
cool this thing called the click wheel 
was. Ever since then, whenever there 
was some time to be spent traveling 
between two places, or really any time 
spent not directly talking to someone 
else, the space was filled with some 
unnatural soundtrack.

Walking outside without the nor-

mal buffer of headphones is imme-
diately unusual. The sounds are 
different. The entire scene feels dif-
ferent. There’s nothing between me 
and the outside world, no playlist to 
absorb myself into during the trek. I 
watch squirrels scamper around and 
up and down trees as a means to dis-
tract myself, becoming not so differ-
ent from the squirrels themselves.

I get a few blocks before my 

phone vibrates; someone else has 
announced they’re running for presi-
dent. So I pull up the news story 
and walk with my head down while 
crossing a few streets because this is 
Ann Arbor and as a pedestrian I am 
untouchable. And at this moment, 
any type of diversion from the quiet 
walk is better than being forced to 
actually acknowledge the silence.

Silence can be uncomfortable. 

Because on that walk to class with-
out headphones, there is nothing left 
to do but to think. To think of mean-
ingless things like what sandwich 
I’ll order at Jimmy John’s when I get 

sidetracked on my walk to class. Of 
slightly more important things like 
the exam I have later that night I’m 
not sure if I had enough time to study 
for. Of the looming prospects of pre-
paring for whatever life after gradu-
ation might look like. The 15-minute 
walk usually accompanied by explo-
rations of the New Releases section 
of Spotify was quickly replaced with 
more introspective explorations.

The Digital Age, or whatever cli-

ché term is being used to describe it, 
brings with it the consequence that 
such moments are rare. The math stu-
dent in me likens it to statistical noise, 
the random variations that get in the 
way of what is trying to be measured. 
Such is the noise that we have thrown 
into our world, in media and in other 
forms, which prevents us from the 
moments we just get to think. Some-
thing else had to get in the way of the 
usual routine, that being losing my 
headphones, just to find this out.

I never ended up getting a new 

pair of headphones. I never needed 
to. I learned to enjoy the moments, 
the walks, the only time in days not 
filled with studying and meetings 
and occasionally sleep. The space 
in my pocket once used for head-
phones replaced with a rosary, lyrics 
replaced with time of serenity, any-
thing to enjoy the fleeting moments 
of calmness in the life of a college 
student. The silence that was once 
unsettling is no longer so.

Marc Maron talks
on creative process

EVENT PREVIEW

Comedian/TV star 
discusses stand-up 
and the age of the 

podcast

By AKSHAY SETH &
ERIKA HARWOOD

Daily Arts Writers

“Yeah, hold on a second,” come-

dian Marc Maron said. “I think 
maybe I’ll get a big bag of that lit-
ter.”

While 
run-

ning 
some 

errands, includ-
ing stocking up 
on cat supplies 
for his two pets, 
Monkey 
and 

Lafonda, Maron 
squeezed 
in 

time for a phone 
conversation 
with The Michi-
gan Daily. With 
strained instructions to a pet store 
employee serving as background 
music, Maron discussed his April 
18 show at the Royal Oak Music 
Theatre, his groundbreaking pod-
cast “WTF With Marc Maron,” 
which helped establish the medi-
um’s relevance and, lastly, his 
recent interview with Mick Jagger.

“Then the next day, when Keith 

(Richards) called — you know, 
Keith’s really my guy,” Maron said. 
“With Keith, I definitely wanted to 
try to be cool and ask some of the 
right questions, to get him to con-
nect with me. And with Mick, I 
just wanted him to be Mick. With 
Keith there was more at stake.”

Though Maron initially attract-

ed attention at the height of the late 
’80s, early ’90s comedy boom, that 
prominence quickly faded as the 
club circuit became oversaturated 
with lukewarm talent. With too 
many amateur stand-ups putting 
out a steady stream of lackluster 
material, career comedians like 
Maron fought to cut through the 
white noise. Other fledgling road 
comics of the time, including now-
household names like Louis C.K. 
and Sarah Silverman, went on to 
find writing careers in sitcoms and 
late night shows as the ’90s wound 
down. Meanhwhile, Maron strug-
gled.

“When things got really rough 

for comedians, after the (first) 
boom, when there was a lot of us 
out there, they just sought to low-
ball everybody because they knew 

we were desperate,” Maron said in 
a recent interview with Vulture, 
explaining his relationship with 
comedy club owners.

Maron’s troubles with alcohol-

ism, depression and drug abuse 
further inhibited his ability to 
stay relevant. Listening to any 
one of the opening monologues 
in his 530 episodes as the host of 
“WTF,” there’s a vivid yet insulat-
ed window into some of the anger 
so visible in his early material. 
In “Thinky Pain,” Maron’s most 
recent Netflix special, he describes 
that technique as “grunting inco-
herently at the audience, giving 
someone the finger, then crying in 
a hotel room.”

“Previous to the era that we’re 

living now, I really couldn’t sell 
tickets so I would do club dates. As 
an unknown headliner there’s no 
reason for clubs to book you unless 
they believe in you, and I burned 
a lot of bridges,” he said. “People 
didn’t really give a shit about me 
... so my experience for all those 
years previous to the podcast and 
the TV show, I was always a pretty 
respected comic, but I just didn’t 
have the draw.”

Broke and unable to book 

shows, and with little to no career 
prospects, Maron bottomed out. 
As he struggled to achieve the 
success he initially found as a 
stand-up, he saw an opportunity 
in trying to talk about his prob-
lems with other comics. The most 
intimate and economical format 
for this became a pre-recorded 
podcast that eventually grew into 
what is now considered one of the 
greatest podcasts of all time. 

“You have to enjoy the pro-

cess,” Maron said. “All that con-
fidence that I didn’t have through 
most of my life, the self-esteem I 
didn’t have through most of my 
life was now actually occurring.” 

The podcast’s success gave 

Maron’s career second wind, as 
did a more tempered and con-
versational tone in his standup. 
“Maron,” his television show on 
IFC, recently finished filming 
its third season, which will pre-
miere this spring. As he continued 
maintaining his sobriety, “WTF” 
served as ongoing therapy with a 
network of peers, many of whom 
Maron had known since his start 
30 years ago. In what is arguably 
the podcast’s best episode, Maron 
spends nearly two hours talking 
and eventually making amends 
with Louis C.K., with whom he 
had a falling out as their careers 
took opposite trajectories.

“I saw the podcast as a commu-

nity service for a community of 
comics. These are my peers, this 
is my life, this is my community, 
this is my neighborhood,” Maron 
said. “The fact that comics were 
coming in and talking and ... were 
listening and catching up with 
other comics they hadn’t talked to 
in a while. It was very gratifying.”

Since the resurgence of his 

career, 
Maron’s 
approach 
to 

stand-up 
has 
become 
more 

methodical. Rather than just 
showing up on stage and bitterly 
screaming at audience members, 
Maron’s recent approach to per-
formance has mellowed out. He 
spends the months leading up to 
tours writing and workshopping 
material at local Los Angeles ven-
ues, then chiseling it into shape 
on the road. The most discernible 
characteristic of his work, which 
will likely be apparent in Satur-
day’s show at Royal Oak, is open-
ness with a sense of control.

As for what’s next, Maron 

doesn’t want to get stuck trying 
to understand where his career 
will guide him.

“I would like to figure out how 

to enjoy life,” said Maron. “That’s 
my goal.”

Men’s Glee performs

By GRACE HAMILTON

Daily Arts Writer

Have you ever had a moment 

when you’re singing in the car 
with your friends (or maybe it’s the 
living 
room), 

and 
things 

come together 
for a second?

“That 

sounded good,” 
someone says. 
You agree, and 
perhaps 
dis-

cuss how you 
wish you were 
singers. 

Maybe this 

analogy doesn’t work for you. 
Maybe you just really enjoyed 
“Glee.” For some reason, you found 
the stylized group renditions pref-
erable to their superior originals. 

If this doesn’t resonate either, 

maybe it’s because you’ve been 
lucky enough to understand the 
unique pleasure and pull of a group 
of voices in person, at a concert or, 
in my case, to my parents’ driving 
music. 

Finally, if you are in the group to 

whom the beauty of choral harmo-
ny is unfamiliar entirely, then an 
introductory opportunity awaits 
you. 

“Choral music has the ability to 

tap into folk music from every cul-
ture, because every culture sings 
and has done so for thousands of 
years,” said Eugene Rogers, Univer-
sity of Michigan Men’s Glee Club 
director. “The ability to connect 
our world, that’s what makes choir 
singing unique.” 

The Men’s Glee Club is 155 years 

old, making it the oldest student-
run organization on campus and of 
one of the oldest collegiate choirs 
in the nation. The choir is made up 
of 100 men, ranging from 17 to 27 
years old. 

Rogers, who studied choral 

music education at the University 
of Illinois and conducting at the 
University of Michigan, has led the 
Glee Club for four years now. In 
this time, the choir has continued 
to grow in musical excellence. 

“This year has been an epic year 

for us,” Rogers said. “We were just 

selected through blind audition 
to perform at the National Choral 
Directors Association Conference 
in Salt Lake City, Utah.”

The Glee Club is one of two col-

legiate choruses selected for this 
honor. All 100 choristers will be 
attending this six-day tour, entirely 
free of charge, due to the club’s 
extensive fundraising efforts and 
alumni support. 

LSA Senior, Patrick Pjesky, the 

Glee Club’s current president, was 
in Dr. Roger’s first graduating class. 
Pjesky and Rogers work as a team, 
with Rogers handling all matters 
musical and Pjesky and the rest 
of the board managing publicity, 
alumni relations and other business 
matters. Pjesky said his involve-
ment in the choir is what helped 
him land a job working in develop-
ment. 

“It’s a unique combination of 

faculty and students together run-
ning this group. If it was just one or 
the other, it wouldn’t be the same,” 
Rogers said. “That’s what makes it 
so strong. These guys are like my 
brothers.” 

Pjesky added, “It’s not uncom-

mon that I receive a call from DR 
(Dr. Rogers) at 11:30 on Friday 
night.”

Aside from the powerful cama-

raderie of the choir, the Glee Club 
is a support base for students. Each 
year, the Glee Club gives away over 
$30,000 in scholarships, made pos-
sible by the continuous involvement 
of over 2,500 living alumni. Choris-
ter needs from travel expenses to 
tuxedo costs are covered. The choir 
has always been strong in providing 
its students with support, financial 
and otherwise. 

“Leadership and social out-

reach have always been very 
strong within the Glee Club. Our 
goal is maintaining student leader-
ship and engagement as well as the 
highest level of musical excellence 
possible,” Rogers said. “To push 
our musical excellence, achieving 
national recognition was huge, as 
well as exploring as many differ-
ent types of male choral singing as 
possible.”

Constructing a diverse and 

meaningful repertoire is chal-
lenging. Rogers tends to organize 

repertoires around certain broad 
themes that can be applied to 
many occasions. This year’s theme 
is “homeland.” 

“We focus on pieces that deal 

with distant and foreign lands, as 
well as the heart,” he said. “The 
word is being used in both a spe-
cific and a very general sense.”

With an entire fund dedicated 

to commissioning new pieces, the 
choir is constantly adding new 
music. At this year’s spring con-
cert, the men will premiere two 
new pieces. 

“One piece by a former Univer-

sity of Illinois professor is set to a 
David Woodsworth text. It con-
nects to the land idea by exploring 
the contradictory way in which we 
appreciate so many things around 
us, yet forget the very essence of 
beauty in nature,” Rogers said. 

Another piece is written by a 

Detroit native, Brandon Waddles. 
This gospel-inspired piece, “Come 
and Go to that Land,” is dedicated 
to Detroit Public Schools and their 
long tradition of musical excel-
lence. 

The wide contrast between the 

two pieces is typical of one of the 
choir’s concerts. 

This Saturday, the University’s 

Men’s Glee Club will also be joined 
by the men’s glee club from the 
University of Miami Ohio. The two 
groups together will total to about 
180 performers. 

“It’s not common to have this 

many men singing at such a high 
level,” Rogers noted. 

In addition to friends, fam-

ily, administrative regulars and 
Ann Arbor fans, the Glee Club is 
looking to expand its audience, 
and Pjesky is helping to lead this 
mission. 

“I am convinced that choral 

music is the way to bring this 
world together,” a Persian audi-
ence member said to Rogers after 
hearing his chorus sing Persian 
music. 

Singing together creates soli-

darity. Music breaks barriers. 
The audience becomes a part of 
the sound and the sound a part of 
everything else. So, unplug your 
headphones and plug in to some-
thing special.

Kendrick’s ‘i’ power

Club 155th 
Spring Hill 
Concert

By CLAIRE WOOD

Daily Arts Writer

The other day, I had a friend tell 

me hip hop was deep. I laughed 
— the hip-hop jams I had heard 
up until that point had dwelled in 
the shallower parts of the puddle. 
I mean, yeah, I’ll dance to the stuff 
(the bass is popping, quite frankly). 
But am I beckoned by some hidden 
form of intellectual insight? Mm, 
nope. 

You can’t blame me — my hip-

hop listenings are, quite honestly, 
few and far between. Neither 
Lil Wayne’s “she lick me like a 
lollipop” or Sage the Gemini’s 
“wiggle like you trying to make 
your ass fall off” leave much to 
think about. That was hip hop for 
me: “pussy on my mind” and “ganja 
in my sweat glands.” Pumping, 
thumping, sensual and shallow. 

And then I heard Kendrick 

Lamar. 

The first song I listened to from 

To Pimp a Butterfly was “i.” It 
starts off with a magical texture 
— light guitar over intricate 
rhythms. “I done been through a 
whole lot,” Lamar dives in. “Trials, 
tribulations, but I know God.” The 
words are genuine, spoken with 

hope for the future. Electric guitar 
wails out over the mix; I feel it 
deep inside me, happy and free. 

“And I love myself.” 
Intricate 
rhythms 
leap 
as 

the chorus unfolds. The song is 
rapping, tapping in my ear drums 
with an irrevocable fervency that 
shakes in your bones.

“I love myself.”
Lamar 
speaks 
again, 
and 

I breathe in the words. It’s a 
contagious sense of movement, of 
vitality. 

“I love myself.”
Lamar declares a third time. 

It’s drums, guitar, and confident, 
absolute self-acceptance — and it’s 
beautiful. 

But 
beneath 
the 

lightheartedness, 
I 
hear 

something else. “Life is more than 
suicide,” the rapper spits in the 
chorus. The guitar and tapping 
percussion continue. “The world is 
a ghetto with big guns and picket 
signs,” Lamar raps. It floats out of 
smiling rhythms and strums, and 
I hear it: pain. Pure and brazen, 
lifting out of a chorus of happiness 
and hope. I hear lines of torment, 
woven into the words like scarlet 
thread in a tapestry. “It’s a war 
outside, bomb in the street, gun in 

the hood, mob of police,” Lamar 
persists. The electric guitar wails 
out once more, but the strings 
scream no longer in joy, but in 
anguish. It’s Lamar’s world — the 
land of big guns, picket signs, gang 
violence and suicide. It goes on and 
on, the pain in this song, masked in 
a spinning melody of acceptance 
and aspiration. 

It’s “i” that disproved my 

belief that hip hop was strictly 
shallow, lollipop-licking music. 
Yes, some songs embody this 
style (the frat party-esque songs 
of Lil Wayne and B.o.B.). But in 
“i,” Lamar makes a statement. 
It’s a sharp juxtaposition that 
embodies the artist’s point — 
the piercing starkness of harsh 
brutality against unadulterated 
self-love. Lamar’s is a message of 
optimism in the midst of struggle. 
We must love ourselves despite 
those that stand in our way. We 
can’t let others bring us down. 
It is a message of strength and 
confidence, one that opened my 
eyes to a world of hip-hop unlike 
the shallow verses I had known 
before. In the words of Lamar, 
“The sky can fall down, the wind 
can cry now, The strong in me — I 
still smile.”

COMMUNITY CULTURE NOTEBOOK
Four lessons for the 
first- time director

By REBECCA GODWIN

Daily Arts Writer

For almost six weeks in 

February and March, I did 
something I never saw myself 
doing. I directed a play. But 
it wasn’t just any play; it was 
<em>my play</em>. Over the 
past year, I wrote, rewrote, 
edited and finally finished my 
full-length comedy, “Once Upon 
A … Oh Crap.” When I began 
the directing process, I had 
absolutely no experience and no 
idea what to expect. And now 
that I’ve finished, I want to share 
some of the things I learned. So 
here goes. 

First:
You’ll be tired — perpetually 

tired. And this won’t necessarily 
be from a lack of sleep, though 
that will certainly play a part. 
No, this exhaustion will come 
from trying to keep track of every 
component of the production. 
It’ll get to the point where you 
forget what it feels like to be well 
rested. And then one day, you’ll 
turn off your alarm in your sleep 
and wake up at 3:30 p.m. and 
wonder what happened and how 
you lost control of your life.

Second: 
Almost all of your time will 

be dedicated to the show. Even 
when you’re not specifically 
working on the show, you’ll 

be thinking about the show 
— thinking about what props 
still need to be purchased or 
collected, 
what 
scenes 
you 

need to go over in rehearsal or 
what costume pieces need to 
be made. And when your time 
isn’t consumed by the show, 
you’ll be spending it catching 
up on homework and projects 
and class. You won’t realize how 
much time you’ve given to the 
show until you’re at a party and 
a song comes on that everyone 
but you seems to know, and then 
you’ll go off to reflect on your life 
choices.

Third:
 You are nothing without a 

good production team. Seriously. 
I can’t stress this any more. These 
are the people you’ll be working 
with the most, so it’s absolutely 
vital you all get along. I know 
that my show wouldn’t have been 
nearly as good as it was without 
those amazing people, so make 
absolutely sure you can stand 
being around your production 
team. If you don’t have the right 
team, what should be a fun and 
exciting challenge will just be a 
challenge. And then you’ll end up 
hating them and then you’ll hate 
yourself for picking them, and 
that’s just messy. 

Last: 
No matter how tired you 

get or how behind you are 

on homework, nothing is as 
rewarding as seeing your hard 
work pay off on opening night. 
When all of the pieces fall into 
place, and you hear the audience 
laugh and applaud, everything 
— 
every 
late 
night, 
every 

frustration, every moment when 
you felt completely exhausted 
and hated — will be forgotten 
and it will all be worth it. There 
are few moments that compare to 
seeing your words brought to life. 
As cliché as it sounds, I wouldn’t 
hesitate to put myself through 
everything again just for that 
moment. 

So yes, my grades slipped a 

little and OK, I’ve fallen behind 
on pop culture and have no clue 
what’s happening on most TV 
shows (who knows what Olivia 
Pope is up to), and sure I’m still 
trying to retrain my body so I 
can go to bed before 3 a.m. every 
night, but all of these things pale 
in comparison to what I pulled 
off. I took my own play, directed 
it and, with the help of a group 
of incredibly talented people, 
staged it in just five weeks. 
And everything I lost during 
the directing process means 
absolutely nothing when I think 
about what I won. Now reread 
these lessons, pull out your 
laptop, face that blank screen 
and think about what you might 
win.

‘Living with Lincoln’
lacks cohesive style

By SOPHIA KAUFMAN

Daily Arts Writer

The problem faced by historical 

documentaries is the difficulty in 
capturing the three-dimension-
al 
complexity 

of the figures 
involved. Abra-
ham 
Lincoln 

is one of the 
most polarizing 
figures of the 
19th 
century; 

it’s difficult to 
find the balance 
between recog-
nizing him as a 
mogul for social 
and 
political 

change, yet not perceiving him as 
the revolutionary spearheader for 
racial equality. He must be ana-
lyzed critically through the lens 
of his time — not retrospectively. 

HBO documentary “Living 

with Lincoln” didn’t face that 
problem; it barely mentioned 
slavery at all. 

“Living with Lincoln” is the 

story of its director Peter Kun-
hardt’s family, and their relation 
to Lincoln — not by blood, but 
through an intense family obses-
sion which began at the time of 
Lincoln’s presidency and has 
trickled down to the present. 
Kunhardt narrates the entire 
piece, explaining why his fam-
ily (previously under the name 
Meserve) has the largest collec-
tion of Lincoln photographs and 

memorabilia. He speaks espe-
cially of his father and paternal 
grandmother and how their lives 
revolved around preserving Lin-
coln’s memory. Their family col-
lection continues to play a role 
in developing Lincoln’s image 
in American society; the images 
used for the penny, the five dollar 
bill and Mt. Rushmore were cho-
sen from their collection.

The most interesting parts of 

the documentary are the shots of 
Kunhardt family’s rooms — over-
flowing with research, faded let-
ters, crumbling journals, old glass 
plate negatives, daguerreotypes 
and salt prints, and more of the 
same packed away in boxes. The 
documentary was aesthetically 
pleasing in terms of cinematogra-
phy, but that’s the most that can 
be said for it. While this family 
does have a unique and intimate 
knowledge of Lincoln, they seem 
to have forgotten what is most 
interesting for us to see. Instead, 
we’re given personal family back-
ground that often feels extrane-
ous. Kunhardt juxtaposes the 
“darkness” surrounding Mary 
Todd with his own grandmoth-
er’s depression, making for an 
awkwardly forced comparison. 
Had the documentary been solely 
about Dorothy Kunhardt instead 
of Lincoln, or only about Lincoln 
without the extra family back-
ground, it would have felt much 
more grounded.

While it’s true that the pur-

pose of the documentary isn’t to 

tell Lincoln’s story but how his 
story intertwines with that of 
the Kunhardt family, the lack of 
historical details and nuances is 
still surprising. There’s a lack of 
new information, give or take a 
couple amusing anecdotes. Kun-
hardt doesn’t even say the word 
“slavery” until halfway through 
the documentary. He refers to 
the Emancipation Proclamation 
and the 13th Amendment in one 
breath, too simply referring to 
the latter as the measure that 
“abolished slavery forever.” This 
is a gross simplification of what 
actually happened, as the Eman-
cipation Proclamation wasn’t just 
a precursor to the 13th Amend-
ment. It had its own stipulations 
and didn’t actually set all the 
slaves free as is so often assumed. 
It was just as much a military 
maneuver as it was a social state-
ment, and all of this is completely 
glossed over in the documentary. 

The point of “Living with Lin-

coln” would have been easier to 
grasp if Kunhardt had chosen a 
style and stuck to it, like he has in 
his other works — either as strong 
a visual presence on screen, or an 
auditory presence or a completely 
distance from the story. His nar-
ration sounds too practiced and 
detached when talking about 
his own family and too familiar 
when speaking about Lincoln. 
His attempt at being both pro-
fessional and the single voice 
of authority in a family project 
doesn’t work.

Waiting on his lap dance from Mary Todd.

FILM REVIEW
Banal ‘Unfriended’

By CHRISTIAN KENNEDY

Daily Arts Writer

There’s that moment when 

your few-years-too-old laptop 
stutters and you impatiently 
wait for it to 
get it together 
so 
you 
can 

continue 
trolling 
BuzzFeed, 
the 
depths 

of Reddit or 
whatever your 
weird Internet 
obsession 
is. 

You want so 
desperately to walk away and 
do something productive, yet 
you sit and pray for the situation 
to get better. “Unfriended” 
feels like this, except it never 
gets better and your computer 
murders you and your close 
friends. 

It’s a fear that most normal 

people have at some point. 
You’ve 
said 
something 

unflattering about a friend and 
if they hear about it, it is not 
going to be pretty. Only in this 
case, you’ve posted a video of 
your passed-out-drunk friend, 
covered in her own feces, 
and anonymously told her to 
kill herself online. And now, 
instead of some throwing some 
serious shade, she comes back 
to murder you and your friends 
via Skype.

The video chat originates 

with some typical teen horror 
film Skype-stripping between 
good 
girl 
“virgin” 
Blaire 

(Shelley Hennig “Teen Wolf”) 
and her wants-to-have-sex jock 
boyfriend Mitch (Moses Jacob, 
“LITERALLY 
NOTHING?”). 

Not 
before 
long, 
slightly 

overweight gamer Ken (Jacob 
Wysocki, 
“Pitch 
Perfect”), 

slutty party girl Jess (Renee 
Olstead, “The Secret Life of 
the American Teenager”), sexy 
trust fund baby Adam (Will 

Peltz, “The Collection”) and 
the bitch that for some reason 
everyone keeps around, Val 
(Courtney Halverson, “General 
Hospital”), crash their cyber 
date. 

Over the next 80 minutes, 

a daring game of “never have 
I ever” ensues, led by an 
anonymous Skype creeper — 
revealed 
through 
Facebook 

chat to be Laura Barnes, their 
“friend” who killed herself a year 
ago to the day. Slowly, fingers 
are put down, computer screens 
go black and every character 
is revealed to be equally awful 
human beings; so much so, that 
it is hard to feel any remorse for 
their gruesome deaths. 

Stylistically, the movie is shot 

99.9 percent as a screenshot of 
Blaire’s computer. Original? Yes. 
Enjoyable? Meh. She takes an 
annoyingly long time to click 

buttons, retypes messages more 
than any person should and her 
messages to her boyfriend are 
borderline painful. Secondhand 
embarrassment 
is 
rampant 

throughout, not to mention that 
her computer freezes and caused 
audible groans throughout the 
theater. 

The trend of modern horror 

movies focusing on technology 
isn’t a revolutionary idea (see: 
“One Missed Call,” “Pulse” or 
“The Ring”), but for whatever 
reason 
“Unfriended” 
chose 

to ground its cinematography 
in technology, yet its story 
explicitly outside of technology. 
The take-away isn’t focused on 
how Internet bullying is a tragic 
occurrence, but rather simply 
to not be an asshole. Don’t steal 
money from your friends; don’t 
start rumors about them; don’t 
have sex with your boyfriend’s 
best friend. You know, the simple 
things in life. Oh, and don’t 
anonymously tell your friend to 
kill herself on the Internet.

Do these things really need to 

be said? No. Did “Unfriended” 
really need to be made? No. 
However, if you’re looking for 
some cheap thrills, a good hate-
watch or enjoy hearing a middle-
aged man scream at a computer 
screen projected on a movie 
screen, this is it.

Rave and 

Quality 16

Creative ‘Face Off’ 

By KIM BATCHELOR

Daily Arts Writer

The season eight finale of Syfy’s 

“Face Off” did not disappoint. Each 
year, it seems like the quality of 
work improves. 
This means a 
finale 
full 
of 

detailed 
and 

imaginative cre-
ations.

This 
sea-

son’s final epi-
sode 
brought 

the three final 
contestants: Darla Edin (28, Min-
nesota), Emily Serpico (18, Florida) 
and Logan Long (29, Utah) up 
against the biggest challenge to 
date. The three, along with a team 
built from eliminated contestants, 
were charged with creating four 
complete looks. The challenge was 
inspired by blockbuster movies such 
as “The Avengers” and “Guardians 
of the Galaxy.” This meant the four 
looks must have been the products 
of a cohesive team and fit within 
the genre of a film — certainly one 
of the most daunting tasks required 
of contestants to date. Additionally, 
their creations were put on display 
for the general public at a special 
viewing event. This is also unprec-
edented in the history of “Face Off.”

Darla was given the theme 

of “fantasy,” and created a set of 
characters based off of the four 
major elements. Emily received 
“post-apocalyptic” and decided on 
an imagination of “The Wizard of 
Oz,” choosing to fuse the charac-
ters with four different materials 
— wood, glass, leather and metal. 
Logan created a “Science Fiction” 
space team of humanoid animals.

The results were some of the 

most detailed and unique creations 
ever produced on the show, and 
certainly some of the best quality. 
Darla’s fantasy spirits were delicate 
and detailed with swirled filigree 
and attention to makeup. Emily, 
the youngest contestant to make 
the final round, shone in her color 
work. All her characters were well 
painted, and she demonstrated 
ingenuity in her creation of shat-
tered glass by mixing plastic and 
silicon. Logan created the most 
cohesive and charismatic team. 

His animal teams each had their 
own personality and you could 
almost hear the witty banter that 
would ensue between the charac-
ters if given their own movie. He 
was praised by the judges for creat-
ing something that would inspire 
potential actors. Additionally, his 
team showed strong fabrication 
work on the shell of the armadillo 
character. 

The most tense part of this “Face 

Off” finale was not any crazy lights 
or neon dance routines, but the way 
which the artists’ work was put 
under intense scrutiny, allowing us 
to get up close and personal. Unlike 
some seasons, there was no clearly 
superior or favorite work. This kept 
the audience in suspense. Addi-
tionally, another layer was added 
through this season’s implementa-
tion of alumni mentors. These men-
tors were the team leaders of one or 
two of the final three contestants, 
and were competing to become a 
two-time winner of “Face Off.” This 
meant that the audience was not 
only rooting for one winner, but for 
two.

The one aspect that lacked was 

the slow, underwhelming nature 
of the public gallery. It would have 
been more interesting to see these 
big blockbuster characters acting 
out scenes from their would-be 
movie. In the past, the costumes 
and designs have had to stand up 
under glow lights, battle conditions, 
circus performances and even 
water elements. The finale would 
have benefited from a little more 
grandeur, especially on a show 
all about pushing the limits of the 
imagination.

In the end, it was Darla’s team 

who won, though all teams were 
impressive this season. The judges 
picked hers in large part due to 
a standout piece which stole the 
show. Her wind fawn showed 
incredible finesse and thought. Her 
decision to include an element of a 
wind instrument into the design of 
the fawn’s horns was unprecedent-
ed, yet still integrated well in her 
design. It is impossible to fault the 
judges for choosing the team that 
showed the most technical skill, 
craftsmanship and imagination. 
She received the audience’s vote 
for a reason.

‘M’ looks to cement legacy

By CINDY YU 

Daily Sports Writer

The No. 6 Michigan women’s 

gymnastics team has one final 
item to check off its bucket list: 
to qualify for the NCAA Super 
Six. To accomplish this feat, the 
Wolverines must have a top-
three finish in the first semifinal 
session on Friday to advance to 
Saturday’s 
coveted 
team 
competition.

Michigan 

(9-0 Big Ten, 
25-3 overall) 
has already 
set program 
records 
in 

total meets 
with scores of 197.000 and 
higher, as well as consecutive 
competitions 
that 
meet 
the 

aforementioned 
scoring 

threshold. It is on pace to set 
records for the highest single-
season 
scoring 
average 
in 

the team and balance beam 
categories with scores of 197.154 
and 49.283, respectively.

Additionally, the Wolverines 

have counted zero falls in 
competition. 
They 
are 
also 

the only team in the nation 
to score at least a 49.000 in 
every 
rotation 
this 
season. 

Michigan clinched the Big Ten 
Championships with a score of 
197.825, the second-highest in 
program history.

While 
these 

accomplishments 
are 

impressive, 
Michigan 
must 

maintain its consistency and 
confidence as it heads to the 
NCAA Championships Friday 
through Sunday inside the 
Forth 
Worth 
Convention 

Center in Texas. Scores will not 
carry over, and the Wolverines 
will have a clean slate.

“Now is the time to enjoy 

and reap the benefits of all the 
hard work that we’ve put into 
everything we’ve done this 
year,” said Michigan coach Bev 
Plocki. “Our most successful 
times are when we’re the most 
relaxed and really just having 
fun performing.”

In the first semifinal session, 

Michigan will face No. 2 Florida, 
No. 3 Utah, No. 7 UCLA, No. 10 
Georgia and No. 11 Stanford.

The 
showdown 
will 
be 

a rematch of sorts, as the 
Wolverines have faced half of the 
competition before. The Bruins 
outscored 
the 
Wolverines, 

197.500-197.000, at the NCAA 
Regionals, 
while 
the 
Utes 

bested them before the sport’s 
largest crowd ever in a dual 
meet, 198.250-197.675. Michigan 
defeated Georgia earlier this 
season, 196.600-195.600.

“I think it’ll be really fun 

to rematch against the teams 
we’ve 
competed 
against, 

especially the ones we lost to,” 
said senior Brooke Parker. “It 
gives us more drive to go out 
there and beat them.”

Scheduling meets against top 

teams from other conferences 
such as the SEC and the Pac-
12 is part of Plocki’s strategy. 
By putting her team in high-
pressure situations throughout 
the season, it not only challenges 
the gymnasts but also prepares 
them for high-caliber meets 
such as nationals.

At the same time, the team 

is trying to not let the level 
of 
competition 
become 
a 

distraction.

“There’s not an offense and 

a defense, so we’re not focused 
on the teams that are in our 
session,” Plocki said. “We’re 
focused on us.”

One key characteristic that 

has helped this squad succeed all 
season long is its determination. 
After graduating six seniors 
and replacing nearly half of its 
routines in the lineup, 2015 was 
expected to be a rebuilding year 
for Michigan.

Though the Wolverines may 

lack depth, they make up for it 
with a strong core group of eight 
gymnasts that have consistently 
competed 
throughout 
the 

season.

“They have a very high level 

of faith and trust in each other,” 
Plocki said. “I think one of 
the keys to our ability to be as 
consistent overall has been that 
when there’s been a mistake, 

nobody’s panicked.”

In previous years, that had 

not always been the case. At 
last year’s NCAA Semifinals, 
the Wolverines were unable 
to recover from a fall that 
resulted in their worst beam 
performance of the season.

Several 
gymnasts 
have 

stepped up to contribute to this 
effort. 
Parker, 
junior 
Briley 

Casanova and junior Lindsay 
Williams combined for a total 
of 87 routines this season. Last 
season, that total was just 25 
routines.

Senior 
Sachi 
Sugiyama, 

currently ranked eighth in the 
all-around and recently named 
a regular-season All-American, 
was selected as one of the six 
national finalists for the 2015 
AAI Award, which is given to 
the nation’s top senior collegiate 
gymnast.

Sophomore Nicole Artz and 

freshman Brianna Brown have 
also received regular-season 
All-American 
honors. 
Artz 

is on pace to surpass former 
Olympian Elise Ray for the 
program 
record 
of 
highest 

single-season scoring average 
in both the all-around and the 
balance beam. Brown is the 
Big Ten Co-Freshman of the 
Year and has contributed on all 
four events in every meet this 
season.

The team has the opportunity 

to make history by becoming 
the first in Michigan history to 
win a national team title.

At the conclusion of the 

last practice in the Donald R. 
Shepherd training center, the 
gymnasts chanted, “Go blue, 
beat everybody.”

“I know everyone wants to do 

that, but I really think we can 
do it this year,” Casanova said. 
“This is the greatest group of 
talent that we’ve had in a while, 
so I’m really excited to be a part 
of it.”

To 
accomplish 
this 
feat, 

the Wolverines will have to 
first qualify for the Super Six 
competition. While none of 
them have competed in one 
before, this team has proven 
week after week that it belongs.

Wolverines prepare for 
Purdue, hope to end rut

By ISAIAH ZEAVIN-MOSS

Daily Sports Writer

After winning nine of 12 

games, including a pair of series 
wins 
against 
Maryland 
and 

Indiana, the Michigan baseball 
team has suddenly found itself in 
a rut.

In 
the 

Wolverines’ 
two 
most 

recent 
midweek 
contests, 
their 
once-

consistent 
offensive 
production 
stagnated, 
compiling 
just four total 
runs in losses 
to Michigan State and Eastern 
Michigan — two bitter in-state 
rivals who, on paper, appear 
inferior to Michigan.

It’s 
evident 
that 
the 

Wolverines’ problems lie with 
batting, and the bounceback 
toward a winning path starts 
there.

“We’ve definitely pitched well 

enough to win,” said Michigan 
coach Erik Bakich. “We’ve got to 
get back to having more of a line 
drive approach and generating 
two-out, clutch hits. We haven’t 
taken 
advantage 
of 
scoring 

opportunities.”

According 
to 
Bakich, 
the 

recent 
offensive 
slump 
can 

be attributed to other teams 
changing their approach from 
the mound.

“(Opposing 
teams) 
aren’t 

giving us as many fastballs,” 
Bakich said. “But that’s fine, 
because 
we’ve 
got 
great 

hitters. And good hitters make 
adjustments at-bat to at-bat, 
great hitters make adjustments 
pitch to pitch, and we’ve got to 
do a better job with making those 
adjustments.”

But 
this 
weekend, 
the 

Wolverines (6-6 Big Ten, 21-16 
overall) get a chance to once 
again find their winning ways 

with a series against Purdue 
(1-8, 12-24).

The Boilermakers have won 

just three of their last 16 games. 
In the losses, Purdue was 
defeated by more than four runs 
per game and scored more than 
three runs only once.

Leading the way for Purdue 

is shortstop Kyle Wood, who is 
third in the Big Ten with a .366 
batting average and is tied for 
third in the conference with five 
home runs.

Outside 
of 
Wood, 
the 

Boilermakers don’t present much 
of a threat. They rank second-to-
last in team batting average and 
sit within the bottom three of all 
major pitching categories. As for 
every Purdue pitcher who has 
made a start this season, only one 
has an earned-run average below 
3.00.

But Bakich is not going into 

this weekend’s series especially 
confident 
about 
pulling 
out 

a 
victory, 
the 
Boilermakers 

unsuccessful 
campaign 

notwithstanding.

“It has nothing to do with the 

opponent. You put the focus on 
yourself and playing the game 
to the best of your ability,” 
Bakich said. “Purdue may not 
statistically stand out, but we’re 
certainly not going to overlook 

the importance of Friday night.”

On the mound for Michigan 

will be the regular weekend 
rotation: 
junior 
right-hander 

Jacob Cronenworth, freshman 
right-hander Ryan Nutof and 
sophomore 
left-hander 
Brett 

Adcock.

This weekend’s series marks 

the beginning of the second half 
of Big Ten play for Michigan. 
Currently, the Wolverines are 
sixth in the conference, leaving 
plenty of work to be done for a 
team that still has conference 
championship aspirations.

Bakich is confident in his 

team’s ability to bounce back 
from what has thus far been a 
disappointing and frustrating 
week and to move forward with 
confidence and success.

“We had a setback Tuesday 

and 
Wednesday, 
there’s 
no 

question about that,” Bakich 
said. “But we had one of the best 
training sessions of the year (on 
Thursday night), and I feel really 
good. They’re going to be very 
motivated internally to come 
back this weekend to play their 
best baseball.”

With the final stretch of the 

season around the corner, it’s 
even more vital for Michigan 
that 
Bakich’s 
encouraging 

prediction is correct.

Robinson finally ready to play

By DANIEL FELDMAN 

Daily Sports Editor

Duncan Robinson knew the 

transition would be difficult.

After 
transferring 
from 

Williams College to Michigan 
in late August, the sophomore 
guard had to mentally and 
physically prepare for life at the 
Division I level.

He helped lead Williams 

to the NCAA Division III 
championship 
game 
his 

freshman year — averaging 
17.1 points and 6.5 rebounds 
per game — but NCAA transfer 
rules 
forced 
the 
6-foot-8 

swingman to sit out a season for 
the Wolverines.

“Sitting out is an adjustment,” 

Robinson said. “I knew coming 
into the year, obviously, I 
wasn’t going to be able to play, 
so I had to mentally prepare 
myself for that. … It has been 
an adjustment, but this year has 
been really helpful for me.”

Robinson wasn’t the only 

player on Michigan’s roster to 
sit out a season due to a non-
injury related reason. Redshirt 
freshman forward Mark Donnal 
sat out the 2013-14 season to 
help improve his strength and 
conditioning.

“He said, ‘It has its benefits, 

buts it’s also really hard,’ ” 
Robinson said. “He kind of 
paved the way for that.”

Freshman 
forward 
D.J. 

Wilson sat out almost all of 
the 2014-15 season as well. 
Robinson said it was good to 
have another player who should 
see significant playing time next 
year sitting alongside him.

In order to best prepare 

himself 
for 
next 
season, 

Robinson 
spent 
this 
year 

working 
with 
Michigan 

strength 
and 
conditioning 

coach John Sanderson. The 
pair will hope to accomplish 
many 
of 
Robinson’s 
goals 

when they work together at 

Camp Sanderson — the coach’s 
legendary, annual conditioning 
camp — during the spring and 
summer in Ann Arbor.

Robinson said Sanderson set 

many goals for him, which he 
will continue to work toward 
before the fall.

On top of purely gaining 

strength, Robinson served as 
a vital cog on the scout team 
this year. With the ability to 
play the ‘2,’ ‘3’ and ‘4’ positions, 
Robinson was able to model 
multiple opposing players.

Though he primarily played 

the ‘3’ at Williams, Robinson 
will likely get the opportunity 
to play at the two other spots 
on the floor for the Wolverines 
next year.

“It kind of depends on this 

summer (and) how much gains 
I can make strength-wise,” 
Robinson said. “I’ll know a lot 
more in the fall.”

An additional factor that will 

play into Robinson’s positioning 
next year is whether junior 

guard Caris LeVert returns for 
his senior year.

Like Robinson, LeVert has 

the versatility to play three 
different positions — the ‘1,’ ‘2’ 
and ‘3’ — but with his status still 
up in the air, all Michigan coach 
John Beilein can do is speculate 
about next season.

“Obviously, if he’s with us, 

that’s a really solid piece,” 
Beilein said. “(It raises the 
question of) where do we play 
him because he can play three 
different positions. So, those 
are all factors. There are so 
many factors. I know it’s late 
and everyone wants to have 
answers.

“Nobody wants it more than 

me. You’ve just got to embrace 
the process and do the best we 
can.”

Until LeVert’s situation is 

resolved, Robinson will just 
have to continue doing what 
he was doing throughout the 
last year: learn the offense, get 
stronger and continue to break 

shooting records in practice, 
though he has already broken 
Nik Stauskas’ 3-point shooting 
record.

While Robinson has been 

involved in team camaraderie 
throughout the year, he’ll have 
an even bigger opportunity 
to bond with his teammates 
and 
hone 
his 
skills 
this 

summer. The entire freshman 
class of Ricky Doyle, Aubrey 
Dawkins, Kameron Chatman, 
Muhammad-Ali 
Abdur-

Rahkman, Wilson and Donnal 
will join him this summer at 
Camp Sanderson.

Robinson likes how many 

players will be taking part in 
an optional offseason program. 
With nearly everyone returning 
to next year’s squad, Robinson 
can’t wait for the new season to 
begin.

“That 
right 
there 
shows 

how invested everyone is in 
the program,” he said. “I think 
Coach Beilein is excited, and I 
know we’re all really excited.”

Michigan to host 
underdog Purdue

By KEVIN SANTO

Daily Sports Writer

The Michigan softball team 

isn’t invincible. It has lost six 
games this season, including two 
at home to unranked Kent State 
and Iowa.

Though fans 

are 
already 

chalking 
up 

three wins in 
this weekend’s 
series 
against 

Indiana, 
the 

Wolverines 
(11-2 Big Ten, 
38-6 
Overall) 

won’t be taking 
the competition 
lightly.

Michigan is coming off a domi-

nant 10-0 win against Michigan 
State, and sophomore left fielder 
Kelly Christner hopes the Wol-
verines carry a relaxed mentality 
into the weekend’s matchup.

“Honestly, (we want to keep) 

having fun,” Christner said. “Our 
captains pulled us aside before the 
game and they were like, ‘I know 
lately we just haven’t been having 
as much fun.’ ”

The Hoosiers (5-7, 14-28) could 

quickly kill the buzz, as they pos-
sess some threats at the plate that 
could deliver and put Michigan on 
upset alert.

Outfielders Shannon Cawley 

and Rebecca Blitz both boast 
.338 batting averages in 41 and 
42 games, respectively. Cawley 
is second on the team in home 
runs with nine, behind catcher 
Kelsey Dotson, who has tallied 
10 homers of her own. She has 
accounted for 35 runs batted in 
while accumulating a .330 bat-
ting average.

But Indiana’s dominant slug-

gers will be faced with two for-
midable opponents in the circle: 

sophomore right-hander Megan 
Betsa and senior left-hander Hay-
lie Wagner.

Betsa is fresh off a five-inning 

no-hitter against Michigan State 
in which she struck out six bat-
ters. In the ace’s last three outings, 
she has not allowed a run and has 
racked up 29 strikeouts through 
19 innings.

The right-hander acknowl-

edged that the midweek Big Ten 
matchup served as good prepara-
tion for the upcoming series.

“(The midweek game) gets 

us loosened up for this coming 
weekend,” Betsa said Wednesday 
after the win. “It’s nice to get out 
of the same old practice routine 
to come up here and play a good 
team.”

As for the Hoosiers, they’re 

likely to lean on right-hander Lora 
Olson in the circle. Olson has been 
laboring for Indiana, pitching in 
30 games while recording a 6.11 
earned-run average, and she will 
need to improve on her perfor-
mance so far to be a difference 
maker against Michigan.

Olson will likely have to face a 

Wolverine starting lineup that has 
just three batters hitting below 
.300. And though junior second 
baseman Sierra Romero is the her-
alded threat in the batting order, 
boasting a .490 batting average, 
Christner’s performances as of 
late have thrust her into the role 
as Michigan’s Goliath. 

In the past 12 games, Christner 

has hit 10 home runs.

As the Wolverines prepare to 

host Indiana at Alumni Field this 
weekend, Michigan coach Carol 
Hutchins is sticking to the usual 
game plan. To her, it doesn’t mat-
ter who’s wearing the other uni-
form.

“I can tell you this about 

(the Hoosiers),” Hutchins said. 
“They’re in our way.”

Managing Sports Editor

John Beilein gathered his team in his suite at 

the Crowne Plaza in Albany, New York, and did 
something you don’t normally think about John 
Beilein doing. It was March 1, 1996, the day before his 
Canisius team opened the Metro-Atlantic Athletic 
Conference Tournament against Loyola (Maryland).

“And he told us, ‘We’re going to win,’ ” recalled 

Mike MacDonald, then an assistant coach at 
Canisius. “He told them to believe, and they 
believed in him.”

But no one else did.
As a No. 5 seed that hadn’t made the NCAA 

Tournament since 1957, Canisius was already a long 
shot.

Then, the Monday before the tournament, 

MacDonald was on a recruiting trip when he called 
back to Buffalo to see how things were going. He 
got even worse news: the team’s star player, Darrell 
Barley, had broken his thumb. He would miss the 
conference tournament, and the Golden Griffins had 
just become an even bigger underdog.

Still, Beilein thought they were going to win.
“We go into the tournament,” MacDonald said, 

“and it was just like, ‘Alright. This is what we got.’ ”

What they had was an unproven program with 

unproven players and an unproven coach in Beilein 
who still had never made the NCAA Tournament.

“Everybody was really down,” MacDonald 

said. “John was pretty down too. I remember 
(another assistant) Phil Seymore talking to him, 
saying, ‘Hey, we gotta rally these guys. We gotta 
get them going.’ ”

But history hadn’t been on their side. Two years 

earlier, Beilein’s Canisius team had gone into the 
conference tournament on a 15-game win streak 
but lost in the semifinals to Loyola, 88-70. The next 
year, his team won at Cincinnati and Charlotte in 
the regular season and made the NIT semifinals, but 
again lost in the conference tournament semifinals 
against Saint Peter’s, 60-56.

Still, Beilein thought he would win. He was 

determined not to let history repeat itself.

“We knew the window was getting closed, 

and we had to win,” MacDonald said by phone 
earlier this month. “And we did. It was amazing. 
Unbelievable coaching job. Classic case of taking 
the guys and putting them in position to play to 
their strengths and letting the guys go, letting 
them do their thing.”

The day after the team meeting, Canisius topped 

Loyola, 74-67, in the first round of the MAAC 
Tournament. The next day, the Golden Griffins upset 
top-seeded Iona in the final seconds, 63-62, to reach 
their first conference final. Finally, they booked 
Beilein’s first trip to the NCAA Tournament with a 
52-46 win over Fairfield in the final.

Beilein’s March magic was born.
He has since recaptured that magic at Richmond, 

at West Virginia and, most recently, at Michigan. 
But if he hadn’t made that run through the MAAC 
Tournament in 1996, there’s no telling what would 
have happened. The senior class that included Barley 
would have departed without making the NCAA 
Tournament, and Beilein might never have made it 
to Ann Arbor.

Through the years, the players have changed, 

the opponents have changed and the scheme has 
changed. But one thing remains constant: John 
Beilein.

Making the NCAA Tournament at Canisius in 

1996 started a run of success that allowed him to 
go to Richmond in 1997, West Virginia in 2002 and 
finally Michigan in 2007. But after years of changing 
locations, Beilein is the same coach.

“We start off every single year reviewing how 

to pass and catch a ball,” said Sean Lonergan, a 
sophomore on this year’s team. “Catch on two feet. 
Pass with the seams so shooters can shoot. Everybody 
gets one-on-one instruction with their jump shot to 
make sure that you’re lifting up.”

Yes, at Michigan, Beilein starts the season by 

teaching his players to catch the ball on two feet.

It was no different 19 years ago. Barley remembers 

doing the same drill for 40 minutes. Ask that team’s 
point guard, Javone Moore, what he recalls from 
Beilein’s practices, and his answer is eerily similar to 
Lonergan’s almost two decades later.

“I remember every single thing he’s ever taught 

us,” Moore said. “When you’re passing the ball, 
pass with two hands. When you’re catching the 
ball, give the guy a target with your outside hand 
so the guy can’t steal it.”

When Barley and Moore get a chance to watch 

Michigan practice today, they still recognize the 
drills they did almost two decades ago. The same 
process earned Beilein his first NCAA Tournament 
at Canisius in 1996, and it has brought his Michigan 
program to the highest level of college basketball 
today.

He has his way. And he won’t give in to outsiders 

who want him to deviate from it.

“You’ve got to have your beliefs as a coach,” 

MacDonald said. “He has a reason for it, and he 
does it. They’ve worked over time. He’s won a hell 
of a lot more than he’s lost.”

That’s not to say Beilein is stubborn. He adjusts 

his scheme and tweaks concepts to fit his players. 
Barley doesn’t ever remember playing zone defense 
in 1996, while Beilein’s teams have used it on and 
off since then.

But the basic tenets, both broad and subtle, 

remain constant. He won’t leave a player in with 
two fouls in the first half. He won’t foul up by three 
points in the closing seconds of the game. And 
he won’t rush a team’s development, sacrificing 
future wins for an extra one this year, no matter 
how much people want him to.

That would mean abandoning the process that 

has gotten him here.

Two weeks before Canisius began the MAAC 

Tournament in 1996, the Golden Griffins faced 
Loyola, their eventual first-round opponent. That 
night, they lost 64-63 after senior Mickey Frazier 
missed a shot in the final seconds.

That kicked off a three-game losing streak to 

end the regular season that sent Canisius down to 
the middle of the conference.

“Mickey was a kid who at the beginning of the 

season had said he wanted to sit on top of the rim,” 
MacDonald recalled.

Two years earlier, it had been a Loyola player 

who did it after winning the conference title. Now, 
Frazier wanted it to be his turn.

The following week, Canisius played at Manhattan 

to cap the regular season. Frazier had been struggling 
down the stretch. Beilein was determined to reverse 
that, no matter how crazy his methods were.

Early in the first half, Frazier hit a 3-pointer. Then, 

Beilein did the unthinkable: He sat a senior for the 
rest of the night so he would go into the conference 
tournament on a high note.

A week after that, Frazier was sitting on top of 

the rim as a champion.

Beilein’s confidence in his players has never 

wavered through the years. He has used it to bring 
the best out of players from Canisius to Richmond 
to West Virginia to Ann Arbor.

This season, days after Michigan upset Ohio 

State to snap a tough five-game losing streak, 
Beilein maintained that confidence despite the 
circumstances.

“You recruit high-character kids, and they get 

better and they don’t point fingers at each other — 
we’ve been united through the whole thing,” Beilein 
said on Feb. 27. “When you see other teams, locker 
rooms get torn apart mentally because of stretches 
like that. We’ve had none of that.

“They understand we’re not good enough yet — 

we’ve got to keep working, we’ve got to keep working. 
Just reinforce that idea: There may be great players 
out there, but you can still accomplish something 
and keep the foundation going if you have the right 
people on the bus.”

Moore couldn’t recall having any off-the-court 

issues on the 1996 team. Yes, that team was on a 
losing streak. Yes, its star player was injured. Yes, it 
had struggled in the conference tournament in the 
past. But at the end of that weekend, Mickey Frazier 
was the one sitting on top of the rim.

After 18 years, Javone Moore 

can still hear John Beilein’s voice 
in his head.

“ ‘You can never get in trouble 

for being early,’ ” Moore recalled 
his old coach saying. “The things 
he teaches you basketball-wise 
are things you carry over into life. 
Little things like being on time 
and valuing someone’s time are 
very important.”

There was another part of 

Barley’s career that he never forgot: 
He started his last three years and 
parts of his freshman year, injuries 
and all, just as Beilein promised he 
eventually would.

“One thing about (Beilein),” 

Barley said, “he was from the old 
school. If he tells you something, 
he’s going to do it. And that’s what I 
always respected about him.”

For Beilein’s way to work, he 

needs players who will buy in — 
guys who will show up on time, 
who will put up with passing 
and catching on the first day of 
practice, who will appreciate the 
process of getting better.

He needs the right people on 

the bus.

“You can see it in each player 

that he recruits that they have 
similar things in common,” Moore 
said. “They’ve probably all been 
winners at their high school. He 
recruits winners. They’re good 
in the classroom. They’re all 
coachable. They can shoot. He 
knows what each individual needs 
by the time he steps on campus, 
and when he gets there, that’s what 
they’re going to be working on.”

Throughout his career, Beilein 

has been well-known for winning 
with 
unheralded 
recruits. 
But 

MacDonald contests the notion 
that Beilein “does more with less.” 
Rather, he does more with the right 
guys. If those guys are top recruits 
and Mr. Basketball finalists, that’s 
great. If not, he’ll take them anyway.

“He’ll see something in a guy 

that others may not see,” Barley 
said. “I don’t think he falls into 
that ‘I need to have this five-star 
guy.’ I think he would rather have 
a four-star or a three-star and 
mold them into an NBA player or 
mold them into an All-American.”

Beilein enjoys not only the 

winning that comes with having 
great teams, but also the process of 
forming them. He enjoys molding 
players like Trey Burke and Nik 
Stauskas at Michigan just as much 
as he did Darrell Barley at Canisius.

“He knows college basketball 

isn’t a one-year thing,” Lonergan 
said. 
“You 
always 
have 
the 

opportunity to grow, and there’s 
always going to be teams that 
are older and more experienced, 
stronger, faster, whatever it may 
be.”

Beilein 
may 
think 
college 

basketball isn’t a one-year thing, 
but many of his counterparts think 
it is. He doesn’t have 7-foot first-
round NBA draft picks. He’s playing 

a different game 
than 
everyone 

else at the elite level. 
In many ways, he’s 
playing 
the 
same 

game he played at 
Canisius in 1996.

Nineteen 
years, 

three stops and hundreds of wins 
later, at a higher level with more 
pressure and better competition, 
Beilein faced an even tougher 
situation in 2014-15. More than half 
of his team missed at least one game 
with an injury or illness.

The Wolverines — none of 

whom had ever missed the NCAA 
Tournament — suffered loss after 
devastating loss in January and 
February, yet they never hung their 
heads, a product of their even-keel 
coach.

“The biggest thing is the coaches 

just sticking with everybody and 
realizing it might not come as 
easy as it has in the past, because 
the older guys have just had more 
opportunities and more reps at it,” 
Lonergan said. “We’re just going to 
keep working and get there.”

But 19-year-olds can’t always 

have the same perspective as 
a 62-year-old veteran who had 
to lose twice in the MAAC 
semifinals before making his first 
NCAA Tournament.

Lonergan is asked if Beilein’s 

mindset trickles down to his team. 
He pauses. He’s honest.

“Yeah, it’s tough,” Lonergan said. 

“Situations like that are tough. … It’s 
really easy to put your head down 
and be like, ‘We’re still not there.’ 
But those little things are what you 
really have to realize the team’s 
going to grow on.”

The team did grow, to the 

point where it lost to Wisconsin 
in overtime on Jan. 24, then at 
Michigan State in overtime a 
week later, then at Indiana at the 
buzzer a week later, then at Illinois 
in overtime four days later. Four 
essentially one-possession losses 
in three weeks, yet the Wolverines 
kept coming back.

Reflecting 
on 
this 
year, 

MacDonald recalled a conversation 
he had with Beilein in the middle of 
this season.

“Sometimes you do your best 

coaching in years like this,” Beilein 
told MacDonald. “You go to the 
National 
Championship 
Game, 

everyone thinks you’re a great 
coach, but sometimes you’re letting 
Trey Burke do his thing and you’re 
not coaching as much.

“It’s years like this when you 

really earn it.”

Beilein had gone through the 

same process with this team as he 
has with any other. He started the 
season with tireless attention to the 
fundamentals, prepared for each 
game with exhaustive scouting 
reports and kept his team improving 
all season.

In the last few weeks of the 

regular season, freshman guard 
Aubrey Dawkins, one of the best 
athletes on the team, had thrown 
down thunderous dunks but also 
missed some. Beilein had talked 
with him about going up for an easy 
layup rather than a highlight-reel 
slam, the fundamental play rather 
than the flashy one.

Finally, almost eight minutes into 

Michigan’s Big Ten Tournament 
opener, Dawkins stole the ball and 
sprinted down the court with an 
easy look at the basket.

That time, he drove to the hoop 

for a layup — and it rimmed out.

But then Beilein did what no 

coach in college basketball ever does 
after a missed layup: He turned 
around to his bench and yelled, 
“That’s good, though!”

He was still yelling “Great job, 

Aubrey!” when the Wolverines 
came back on defense.

The comment seemed odd: The 

way Michigan’s season went, that 
miss easily could have been the 
difference between moving on to 
play No. 1 seed Wisconsin and going 
home for the offseason.

But Beilein saw positives, even if 

he didn’t see results.

A day later, Dawkins — sitting 

at his locker, head down, after a 
season-ending loss to the Badgers — 
took a minute to reflect on the play.

“He wants us to grow and keep 

being aggressive,” he said. “That’s 
all we gotta do. You can’t make 
every shot. That’s just basketball. 
But the fact that we’re making the 
play still, it shows our ability to see 
the game and just grow.”

When 
told 
about 
Beilein’s 

reaction 
to 
a 
missed 
layup, 

MacDonald saw the same coach he 
worked for in 1996.

“That’s what a good teacher 

does,” he said. “You’re a little kid 
and you’re learning how to ride a 
bike, and you pedal once or twice 
and then you fall over. What did 
your mom and dad do? They didn’t 
yell at you. (They said), ‘Good job, 
good try, you’re learning.’ ”

“It’s the same thing. (Beilein) is 

a persistent teacher. He really will 
zero in on what guys need to do.”

Before he hangs up the phone, 

MacDonald has one more story to 
tell about 1996.

When Canisius finally won the 

MAAC Tournament, cut down 
the net and reached the NCAA 
Tournament, its first matchup was 
No. 3 seed Utah. The Utes were 
coached by the late Rick Majerus 
and led on the floor by Keith Van 
Horn, Michael Doleac and Andre 
Miller, all future NBA players. 
There were some challenges that 
Beilein’s four-year plan couldn’t 
yet meet.

“We 
got 
freaking 
drilled,” 

MacDonald said. “They killed us.”

The game was, however, at the 

same time as a 14 vs. 3 upset that 
did end up happening — Princeton 
vs. UCLA. Canisius’ magic ran out, 
so the nation stopped watching.

“The 
entire 
country, 
even 

Buffalo, got switched off our game, 
we were getting killed by so much, 
and (they) went to the Princeton-
UCLA game,” MacDonald said.

“The bubble pops sometimes.”
That happened again this year. 

Beilein went through the same 
process that has brought him 
to the top of college basketball 
before. He just ran out of magic.

But as Lonergan said, Beilein 

knows college basketball isn’t a 
one-year thing. He’ll get his guys 
back in the gym again next year, 
passing, dribbling and catching 
just like always. He’ll give his team 
a chance in the end.

That will be enough. It always 

has been.

John Beilein has found success at Michigan with the same methods he has used throughout his entire coaching career.

still the same
