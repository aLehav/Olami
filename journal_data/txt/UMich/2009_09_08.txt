Officials will ask sick
students to isolate
themselves, go home
if they can
By STEPHANIE STEINBERG
Daily StaffReporter
The much-hyped swine flu epi-,
demic is expected to sweep across
college residence halls and class-
rooms this fall, as students from all
corners of the world converge on
their respective college towns. But
University of Michigan officials say
they've got the game plan to effec-
tively fight the flu.
Dr. Robert Winfield, the Univer-
sity's chief health officer, said the
the avian flu scare three years ago.
At that time, the University
formed the All Hazard Planning
Group - a committee of individu-
als from various University depart-
ments - that made preparations for
any pandemic that might reach the
campus.
"We assembled a group of about
50 people from across the Univer-
sity to consider what could happen,
how we would prepare for that,
what things we could do to prevent
spread, what things we could do to
assure the safety of students, fac-
ulty and staff, how we could keep
operations going academically and
research-wise and how to keep the

hospitalsystemrunningintheevent
of a pandemic," Winfield said.
After plans were developed, the
work was put aside and the emer-
gencyplanninggroupbeganconsid-
ering other kinds of emergencies,
including how to deal with active
shooter situations like the one at
Virginia Tech in 2007.
With the outbreak of HlN1 in
Mexico last April, Winfield said the
committee reconvened to update
pandemic prevention strategies -
holding daily phone conferences in
the spring and numerous meetings
throughout the summer.
"We reactivated our influenza
plans and began actively screening
for HINT disease, paying a lot of
attention to (World Health Orga-
nization) notices, the (Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention)
guidelines, the Michigan Depart-
ment of Community Health guide-
lines and working closely with the
Washtenaw County Community
Health Department,' he said.
HOUSING'S PLAN
The All Hazard Planning Group
has been collaborating with Uni-
versity Housing on plans to prevent
HINT from spreading through resi-
dence halls. Housing Spokesman
Peter Logan said the University
advises ill students who live nearby
to leave campus and go home to
recover.

Ann Arbor line shuts down
* after funding dries up;
University will now shuttle
students from Oxford area
By MATT AARONSON
Daily News Editor
The Link, a circulator bus that connected
Oxford residents and their neighbors to Central
Campus and downtown Ann Arbor since 2005,
has recently been replaced by a shuttle run by
the University's Department of Parking and

Transportation Services.
The familiar purple bus, which ran during
the school year, had been funded jointly by the
Ann Arbor Transportation Authority, the Ann
Arbor Downtown Development Authority, the
University's Parking and Transportation Ser-
vices and the state of Michigan. But on June 3,
the DDA withdrew its funding for the down-
town portion of the route, citing a study by its
transportation committee that found a dispro-
portionate amount of its users were University
students.
Soon after, Parking and Transportation Ser-
vices withdrew its funding for the Link, too,
while it explored a similar service using its own
buses.

"We put it on our to-do list," said Bitsy Lamb,
manager of Transportation Services. "There
wasn't any doubt that we'd find a way to man-
age it."
The AATA Board of Directors voted to dis-
continue the Link service on Aug.19.
The new Oxford Shuttle, which officially
launched Aug. 31, runs every weekday and has
separate routes for class and non-class hours.
Before and after classes - from 7:15 a.m. to
8:10 a.m. and from 5:20 p.m. to 2 a.m. - the shut-
tle makes a 15-minute cycle, stopping at Oxford
Housing, the Trotter House, the Undergradu-
ate Library, the Michigan Union, the Kraus
Building, the C.C. Little Building, East Quad

The ever-changing State St. scene

New businesses, relocations
of old ones have once again
given the area a facelift
By KATHERINE MITCHELL
Daily StaffReporter
The State Street shuffle of shops, restaurants
and other businesses continued this summer,
as retailers swapped storefronts and locations,
seeking the perfect formula to win over the fick-
le student shopper.
After two years in business, Sava's State Street
Cafe reopened last week across the street from
its previous location, replacing the Zanzibar
restaurant. The location at 216 S. State St. closed
mid-July after about 13 years of business.
Sava's previously occupied 211 S. State St.,
but, according to owner Sava Lelcaj, the loca-
tion change was long overdue.
"We had really grown out of our space," she
said, citing in particular the need for a new
kitchen to handle Sava's burgeoning catering
business.
Lelcaj had looked at multiple properties last
winter - including the former Earl of Sand-
wich location and the retail space near the new
4 Eleven Lofts on East Washington Street -
before the 216 S. State St. location opened up
this summer.
The new location boasts 5,500 square feet of
space with a full basement for additional stor-
age. It almost quadruples the size of the former
restaurant.
"People are just floored when they come in,"
Lelcaj said.
The cafe's new home includes a second floor

FRATERNITY ROBBED
At Sammy, gameday
celebration spoiled by
late-night break-in

Between $10,000
and $15,000 in goods
believed to have been
taken early Sunday
By DEVON THORSBY
DailyStaffReporter
Students and fans celebrated
Michigan football team's season
opening victory with parties across
campus Saturday night. But for the
brothers at the Sigma Alpha Mu
(Sammy) fraternity, the night of fes-
tivities ended early when they dis-
covered thousands of dollars worth
of personal items stolen from an
upper-level bedroom.
Around 1:30 a.m. Sunday morn-
ing, members of the Sammy fra-
ternity reported a break-in at their
fraternity house, located on the
corner of Oxford and Hill Streets, to
Ann Arbor police. Computer elec-
tronics, football tickets and clothes
were among the items stolen from
one room, according to the frater-
nity's president Brian Kostukovsky.
Kostukovsky, an Engineering

junior,suspectsthebreak-inoccurred
between 11:30 p.m. and 1:00 am.,
though there were no witnesses.
Kostukovsky said he thinks the
thief or thieves entered the room
by climbing up a fire escape, pry-
ing the window open and barri-
cading the door to the room with a
dresser while the items were being
removed.
"We don't have an official num-
ber, but somethingbetween $10,000
and $15,000(ofgoods)werestolen,"
Kostukovsky said.
Kostukovsky said police did not
arriveat the house until two and a
half hours after they were initially
called. He added that the fraternity
has yet tohbe contactedby detectives
from the Ann Arbor Police Depart-
ment concerning the break-in.
Multiple messages left for the
Ann Arbor Police Department were
not returned yesterday.

Home to many secrets.

The huge ower looming over
the Michigao Union has had a
storied, if noe controversial, his-
tory.
When the Union wan con-
struted, the piano were
unmatched by similar spaces
at other American colleges and
universities, according to the
Bentley Historical Library's
website. Allen B. and Irving K.
Pond's design called for a build-
ing some 250 feet long and about
200 feet wide - all of which
would be capped by the massive
tower in the middle.
The Union was first available
for students to use in 1919 and
cost more than $1.15 million to
build.
But sitting atop 'the campus
landmark, the tower has served
as both the building's architec-
tural and historical focal point.
The tower was once home to
three senior honorary societ-

ies, which together make up the
"Tower Society," according to a
1996 Daily article "Behind the
Tower Walls." The senior honor
society Michagamua, Adara - a
female-only honor society -
and the Vulcans- an engineer-
ing senior honor society - have
all been included in the "Tower
Society" at one point in time.
The make-up of the "Tower
Society" has changed over
time, though. For example,
the group Adara joined in the
early 1980~s after a Title IX
lawsuit challenged the legality
of allowing the then-male-only
honor society Michagamua on
campus.
As well as being home to the
senior societies, the Union can
partly thank the societies - spe-
cifically Michagamua - for its
existence. Michigamus played
an instrumental role in the fund-
raising that led to the construc-

tion of the Union itself. This
effort fundamentally linked the
organization with the building
and led to an agreement with the
University protecting Michaga-
mua's ability to use the seventh
floor for its activities. After that,
Michigamua met on the seventh
floor of the Union, Adara on the
sixth and the Vulcans on the
fifth.
That arrangement lasted
until the morning of February
6, 2000, when members of the
Students of Color Coalition
took over the space for 37 days
in response to Michigamua's
alleged misuse of Native Amer-

After that occupation, Mich-

NEWS BRIEFS
ROCHESTER, Mich.
Progress made
with striking profs
A The head of a union represent-
ing professors at a suburban Detroit
university says "good progress" is
being made toward resolving a fac-
ulty walkout.
The president of the Oakland
University chapter of the American
Association of University Profes-
sors said Monday talks with school
administrators made progress over
the weekend.
But Joel Russell cautioned that
"being close" to a deal doesn't mean
a new contract is imminent.
Russell spoke to The Associated
Press while marching in Detroit's
annual Labor Day parade.
Classes remain canceled at the
public four-year school in Roches-
ter. It has about 18,000 students.
The union authorized a strike
after the university proposed a
three-year wage freeze along with
cuts in health-insurance benefits.
BAGHDAD, Iraq
Suicide bombings
kill at least 17
Suicide attackers struck near a
Shiite mosque north of Baghdad
and a checkpoint west of the capi-
tal on Monday as bombings killed
at least 17 people nationwide.
The violence was concentrated
in former Sunni insurgent strong-
holds that have seen a sharp
decline in violence after local trib-
al leaders turned against al-Qaida
in Iraq. Despite the relative calm,
a series of deadly bombings have
raised concerns about a resur-
gence of violence as the U.S. mili-
tary scales back its presence, with
a full withdrawal planned by the
end of 2011.
The attacks - which mainly
targeted checkpoints and Iraqi
policemen - also highlighted the
weaknesses in the Iraqi security
forces, which are struggling to
prove they are ready to take over
from the Americans.
The deadliest attack was a sui-
cide car bomber who struck a line
of vehicles waiting to be inspected
before crossing a bridge near the
Anbar provincial capital of Rama-
di, police said.
MILWAUKEE, W.I.
Man arresfed,
connected to nine
killings
Milwaukee police said Monday
that they arrested a man connected
to the slayings of nine women dat-
ing back to 1986 by using a DNA
* sample he provided just last week.
Walter E. Ellis, 49, was taken
into custody after a struggle at a
motel on Saturday, said police Chief
Edward Flynn. Ellis was charged
with two counts of first-degree
intentional homicide and more
charges are expected, said Milwau-
kee County District Attorney John
Chisholm.
Police said Ellis' DNA was found
on the bodies of nine women who
were killed between 1986 and 2007

on the city's north side. Investiga-
tors believe eight of the women
were prostitutes and one was a
runaway. They ranged in age from
16 to 41.
Flynn said police used a warrant
to obtain Ellis' DNA on Friday, so
investigators had to move quickly
to test the evidence because Ellis
knew they were looking for him. He
was arrested in nearby Franklin.

It wasn't under the moonlight,
and it wasn't quite the funk of
40,000 years. But 900 zombies,
aliens and Star Wars Stormtroop-
ers boogeying to Michael Jackson's
"Thriller" might be a sight that
almost stops your heart.
The masquerade of sci-fi faith-
ful performed Michael Jackson's
signature "Thriller" music video
dance routine on Sunday. And if
officials approve, they will have set
a new Guinness World Record.
The crowd turned out in a down-
town Atlanta hotel ballroom dur-
ing Dragon Con, which is billed as
the country's largest convention
dedicated to science fiction, fanta-
sy, gaming, comics and more.
The iconic video played on ahuge

channeled the pop star in red jeans,
a red leather jacket, and white socks

UK court convicts three
of plot to blow up airliners

Joseph Kennedy speaks at a Celebration of Life Memorial Service for Sen. Edward
Kennedy at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library Friday.
Joseph Kennedy will
not run for uncle's seat

Security officials
say plan was directly
linked to al-Qaida
LONDON (AP) - Three British
Muslims were convicted Monday
of plotting to murder thousands
by downing at least seven airliners
bound for the U.S. and Canada in
what was intended as the largest
terrorist attack since Sept.11.
A jury at a London court found
Abdulla Ahmed Ali, 28, Assad Sar-
war, 29, and Tanvir Hussain, 28,
guilty of conspiracy to murder by
detonating explosives on aircraft
while they were in-flight.
Four other alleged conspirators
- whom the prosecution said were
to have smuggled liquid explosives
onboard jetliners disguised as soft
drinks - were acquitted of con-
spiringto blow up planes. The jury
could not reach a verdict on an
eighth man.
British and U.S. security offi-
cials said the plan - unlike many
recent homegrown Ruropean
terrorist plots - was directly
linked to al-Qaida and guided
by senior Islamic militants in
Pakistan, who hoped to mount a
spectacular strike on the West.
The officials said British plot-
ters were likely just days away
from mounting their suicide
attacks when police rounded
up 25 people in dawn raids in
August 2006.
Their arrests led to travel
chaos as hundreds of jetliners
were grounded across Europe.
Discovery of the plot also trig-
gered changes to airport secu-
rity, including new restrictions
on the amount of liquids and gels
passengers can take onto flights.
Prosecutors said suspects had
identified seven specific flights
from London's Heathrow air-
port to New York, Washington,
Chicago, San Francisco, Toronto
and Montreal, as their targets.
British authorities estimate

that, if successful, around 2,000
passengers would have died. If
bombs were detonated over U.S.
and Canadian cities, hundreds
more would have been killed on
the ground.
Plotters planned to assemble
bombs in airplane toilets using
hydrogen peroxide-based explo-
sives injected into soda bottles.
"They were to be detonated
in-flight by suicide bombers,"
including several of the accused,
prosecutor Peter Wright said.
Tests by scientists who repli-
cated the bombs in a laboratory
showed the devices could produce
powerful explosions, though there
is no evidence that the terrorist
cell had perfected the technique.
Wright told the trial that the
group's suicide attacks were
planned by "men with the cold-
eyed certainty of the fanatic" and
intended as "a violent and deadly
statement of intent that would
have a truly global impact."
He said the plot would have
caused "a civilian death toll from
t; U-j
Start build
to Pr(

terrorism on an almost unprec-
edented scale."
All eight defendants had denied
most charges against them, claim-
ing they were planning a stunt
- and not a terrorist attack - to
expose failings in Western foreign
policy.
Prosecutors were unable to pro-
duce evidence that the men had
produced a single viable bomb.
The trial was the second to take
place in a case which has frustrat-
ed prosecutors.
Last year, Ali, Sarwar and Hus-
sain were convicted of conspira-
cy to murder, but the jury could
not reach a verdict on whether
they specifically targeted air-
craft. The jury at that trial failed
to reach verdicts against other
four defendants.
Jurors on Monday cleared
Donald Stewart-Whyte, 23, of all
charges. They found Umar Islam,
31, guilty of a charge of conspira-
cy to murder, but could not decide
if he was involved in targeting
aircraft.

Decision is expected
to widen the field of
candidates
Former Rep. Joseph P. Ken-
nedy II, the eldest son of Robert F.
Kennedy, announced Monday he
would not run for the U.S. Senate
seat held for nearly 50 years by his
late uncle, Rdward . Kennedy.
In a statement, the former six-
term congressman said he cares
about those seeking decent hous-
ing, fair wages and health care.
But he added, "The best way for
me to contribute to those causes
is by continuing my work at
Citizens Energy Corp."The non-
profit organization provides free
heating oil to the poor, but Ken-
nedy likely would have faced
campaign questions about fuel it
received from Venezuelan Presi-
dent Hugo Chavez - a persistent
U.S. critic.Yet Kennedy also may
have garnered support from the
legions of Massachusetts Demo-
crats who long supported his
uncle, as well as national follow-
ers of his father, who was a U.S.
senator from New York when he
was assassinated in June 1968 as
he sought the Democratic presi-
dential nomination.
"My father called politics an
honorable profession, and I have
profound respect for those who
choose to advance the causes of
social and economic justice in
elective office," the 56-year-old
Kennedy said.
The decision is expected to
widen the field of announced can-
didates for the late senator's seat.
It became vacant Aug. 25, when
Edward Kennedy died of brain
cancer at age 77.
Three veteran Massachusetts
congressmen - Reps. Michael
Capuano, Edward J. Markey and
John Tierney - have said they are
considering campaigns but would
not run against a member of the
Kennedy family. The senator's
widow, Vicki, had previously ruled
out a campaign.
In a fiery speech Monday morn-
ing to a Boston labor breakfast,
Capuano sought to distinguish
himself from unnamed competi-
tors.
"Everybody loves you today,"
the congressman told a crowd of
about 400, including Tierney and
Markey. "Everybody's for prevail-
ing wage, everybody's for (project-
labor agreements), everybody's for
this, that and the other thing. Me
too. That'sgood. But when itcomes
time to make the tough decisions,
that's when you start to figure
who's with you and who's not."
Markey said before addressing
the crowd that le was still weigh-
ing a race, highlighting his stature
as a 33-year member of the House,
honorary title as dean of the New
England delegation and chairman-
ship of the House Select Commit-
tee for Energy Independence.
"And I have to weigh that in bal-
ancing it against how effective I
can be as a senator," he said. "But I
will not consider it unless Joe Ken-
nedy does not run."
Former Rep. Martin Meehan,
who is now chancellor of the Uni-
versity of Massachusetts-Lowell
but still has nearly $5 million in his
campaign account, had also said he
would defer to Kennedy, but he has
been lukewarm about a campaign
even if Kennedy declined to run.
Another Democrat, Rep. Ste-
phen Lynch, said at the breakfast
it's "likely" he will be announc-

ing his candidacy during the next
week. The former ironworker, who
lives in blue-collar South Boston,
said he wanted to wait until after
Labor Day.
"I probably won't fit in in the

U.S. Senate, but, I think that, in
a lot of cases, the people of Mas-
sachusetts don't want a senator
to fit in. They want them to stand
out, and I offer through my experi-
ence," Lynch said.
Lynch recalled twice being laid
off from shipbuilding and auto-
making jobs, adding, "I share the
experience that a lot of others are
feeling right now."
Attorney General Martha Coak-
ley became the first high-profile
Democrat to declare for the seat
when she announced her candida-
cy last week. She wasted little time
in flexing her political muscle.

Looking back
A review of this summer's most important moments
While you might not have noticed thanks to this week's
beautiful weather, summer is wrapping up. It's time to
say goodbye to that internship with your local mem-
ber of Congress, that low-paying job at an ice cream shop, that
humanitarian mission to Africa or whatever you did to pass the
time while school was out. For all students returning to Ann Arbor
- or at least those who are somehow still able to afford the Uni-
versity's ridiculous tuition - it's another semester of staying up
all night writing research papers, furiously joining student groups,
rushing, cramming and looking for work.

I will not pay a penny."
- Lubna Hussein, a journalist and United Nations worker, on refusing to pay a fine after being
arrested in Sudan for wearing pants, as reported yesterday by the New York Times.

But whether this is your first semester
in Ann Arbor or your last, we thought you
could use a catch-up on what happened
while you were away.
While you probably didn't miss the foot-
ball team's huge win on Saturday, you might
not know that the win was Rich Rodri-
guez's first piece of good news all month.
The Detroit Free Press accused Rodriguez
and his staff of violating NCAA regulations
by requiring his players to practice too long
and too often. In response, the University
did what it's best at: launched an inves-
tigation. And if that weren't enough bad
news, Nexity Bank is suing Rodriguez for
defaulting on a $3.6 million loan. But for
now, Rodriguez can rest a little easier hav-
ing delivered Wolverine fans the win they
were craving.
And on the subject of cravings, Univer-
sity smokers beware: You have approxi-
mately 10 months to quit. As of July 2010,
campus will become a smoke-free environ-
ment, both indoors and outdoors. No, you
won't get a ticket or a trip to jail if you do
it - you'll just be guilted into feeling really,
really bad about it. The University claims
the ban will cut down health care costs by
making students and employees healthier.
By this logic, maybe shutting down the
residence hall cafeterias would be more
appropriate.
But one bad habit that the University
can't seem to quit is raising tuition year
after year. This year was no different, with
the Board of Regents passing yet another

tuition hike of 5.6 percent for in-state stu-
dents. What was a surprise, though, was
the fact that two regents voted against the
hike - the first such dissent in years. At
this rate, we might see an end to the tuition
hikes in only a few more (gulp) years.
But the Board of Regents wasn't the only
governing body experiencing some dissent.
Across the country, "real" Americans are
turning out en masse to public forums on
health care to express their opposition to
Congress and President Barack Obama's
health care plans. Common methods of
expression have included shouting at legis-
lators until they give up and hijacking the
discussion to focus on the pressing issue of
Obama's citizenship. These birth certifi-
cate fanatics, despite having been shown
irrefutable evidence to the contrary, hope
to remove Obama from office by proving
that he was never born in the United States
(as if Joe Biden becoming president would
actually end their complaining).
The economy still sucks. The war in
Afghanistan is going worse than ever.
Swine flu may or may not kill us all. But
whatever happens, the Daily will be here to
cover it (unless the swine flu thing comes
to fruition). We would like you to be here
with us.
So write letters to the editor and submit
viewpoints. Let us know what stories you
care about and what you think of them.
The Daily is your student newspaper, but
we can only fulfill this role with your help
and attention.

'm not concerned with your liking
or disliking me ... All I ask is that
you respect meas a human being."
- Jackie Robinson
To say that Pres-
ident George W.
Bush did a lot of
dumb things and
was criticized for
them would be an
understatement of
magnificent pro-
portions. Bush- IMAAN
bashing becameS
quite a sport over 5YED
the past few years,
and not just among
the prissy liberals of New York, San
Francisco or the average college
town. President Bush's actions dis-
appointed, angered and embarrassed
nearly every segment of this country
at some point and to some extent.
So how is it that just six months into
his first term - with no new wars and
hismostcontroversialpolicyinitiative
the Good Samaritan-esque notion of
health care for all - President Barack
Obama has managed to become hated
enough to actually warrant compari-
son to Bush at his lowest?
True, Obama's approval rating
remains above 50 percent, but you
wouldn't know that from the out-
bursts at town hall meetings across
the country during the August
recess - including at a forum featur-
ing Rep. Gary Peters (D-Mich.) in
West Bloomfield last week. In pub-
lic appearances by politicians of all
levels, protesters have raised hell
about everything from the president's
healthcare plan to his citizenship.
Sure, other presidents have had to
put up with such outbursts before - as
I said, President Bush certainly faced
his fair share of critics. But therein
lies the issue: Bush was hated for his

two costly, failing wars, his handling
of the economy and the failure of his
main policy initiatives like No Child
Left Behind. Bush was hated, fairly or
not, for a reason - and he was hated
only after he had failed.
It's very different with Obama. His
term has just started. Far from hav-
ing failed, his policies have not yet
even been implemented. And even
the severe economic recession that
Obama inherited is dwindling.
And yet all we hear are mad jeers
about the socialist takeover of Amer-
ica instigated by a secret Muslim,
totally Kenyan, not-really American-
born Chicago sleaze-bag who conned
everybody into making him presi-
dent.
Such nonsense from extremist nut-
jobs is common, but they're usually
drowned out by voices of reason. But
this time around, when the yelling
starts at those town halls, Obama can
find no such defenders.
Instead of booing and silencing the
woman who interrupted a political
event by Rep. Mike Castle (R7-Del.)
by demanding Obama produce a
legitimate birth certificate, the crowd
actually cheered, as if hearing for the
first time an articulation of their most
closely held beliefs. It's been the same
story at forums on healthcare across
the nation - one person screams out
baseless accusations about death pan-
els and socialism and dozens more
roar in support.
It's easy to dismiss this phenom-
enon as a set-up, as liberals have done.
They say these anti-Obama maniacs
are planted by the healthcare lobby in
hopes of changing the public percep-
tion of the debate. No doubt that's a
part of it, but I find it hard to believe
that the crowd that roars in support
of the agitators has also been planted.
The problem is not that simple at all.

In November, Obama did what
seemed utterly impossible evena cou-
ple of years ago: win the presidency as
a black man. He did so because of his
immense personal talents and orga-
nizing prowess. He won over groups
into his coalition that even the most
optimistic Democrat would not have
thought possible.
Health care is
just their excuse
to organize.

But too easily we forget that nearly
60 million voters rejected him. For
all Obama's grace, poise and charm,
nearly half the electorate thought a
washed-up John McCain was still the
better choice. Obama became presi-
dent by getting a close majority of the
country to accept him, despite all his
outsider traits.
But some people will never accept
him. To them, he'll always be a secret
Muslim, a Kenyan-born usurper or a
socialist determined to drive white
America into the ground. No mat-
ter what he accomplishes, this presi-
dent will always be Barack. Hussein.
Obama. A large segment of the popu-
lation will never vote for him as one of
them - let alone as their leader.
That is, of course, the tragedy of
being a trailblazer. And that is why
the mobs still roar in support when a
racist madly waves a birth certificate
while calling our president a liar.

All in for Michigan football

nave had the pleasure and good fortune
of having played football for a very long time.
Those long years of hard-won experience have
given me the knowledge and the right to com-
ment about football and its requirements at
every level, from grade school to high school to
college and all the way up to professional.
It must be understood that football is an
extremely difficult game. While most readily
observe the physical component of this diffi-
culty, it is the mental toughness required by
the sport that often goes overlooked. Many do
not have the mental toughness, sincere com-
mitment or love for the sport needed to excel at
the highest level. Spending extra time outside
of team-sanctioned routines is the responsibil-
ity of any player who wants to gain a spot on
a team or win a position or championship. The
player must make the conscious decision to put
in the extra time, and it is this extreme dedica-
tion that separates the mediocre from the truly
great.
No coach, teammate or parent can make
that happen, but it is the responsibility of the
University, the athletic department and the
coaching staff to provide opportunities for per-
sonal improvement to every player. Michigan
does this, as does every other well-organized
program within college football. It is always
offered but never required.
For anonymous former or current players to
make allegations that a coaching staff would
knowingly violate NCAA rules is ludicrous. If
one looks at the situation from a contextual
standpoint as opposed to simply reacting with
emotional outrage, it's obvious the scenario is
nonsensical. What would be the incentive for
the coaching staff when weighed against the
inevitable consequences? Many have said that
such an act would be committed in order to
gain an edge over the competition, but the odds
of any coaches consciously deciding to disobey
such a powerful organization as the NCAA for
such a slight edge is laughable. Instead, these
claims expose a lack of character in the young
men who made them and reveal their weakness
- they do not understand the level of commit-
ment needed to rise to the highest level of the
game.
What we learn in football is how to overcome
a team, a single opponent, and most important-

ly our own shortcomings. As players, we are
given the tools to succeed, but only with our
own initiative can we utilize them. Coaches
cannot force players to fight for success, and
these young men who have made unsupported
accusations do not have the drive to search for
success by themselves.
I did not want the uncommitted as team-
mates, and I do not want the uncommitted
representing the Michigan football team. I
want dedicated warriors who understand the
demands, both physical and mental, of this
most difficult game. I do not support the viola-
tion of NCAA regulations - I am insisting that
there has been no such violation. This episode
is simply the most pronounced example of a
series of undercuts made against Rich Rodri-
guez. For a coach to gain success, he must have
the support of his administration, the loyalty
of his players, and the respect of his peers. I
believe Rodriguez may have all but the first of
this trifecta, but it is this important missing
item that obstructs our program's rise.
Rodriguez is attempting to advance Michi-
gan football into the modern era - an era of
football that is played with great team speed
on both sides of the ball. I have met the man.
I have met his coaches. They are committed.
They have won and know what it takes to win.
They are advancing the Michigan program and
taking it to the level we have failed to reach in
previous seasons.
Those who attempts to undercut Rodriguez
and the Michigan football program with base-
less accusations are self-serving. They are
placing their own agenda above the good of the
program, and that will doom a team to failure in
every challenge. It's time for the University and
athletic administration to finally honor the slo-
gan they came up with and go "all in for Michi-
gan." Until that occurs, we as a Michigan nation
must come together and write letters and send
emails to all who may have an effect, whether
that be the press, President Mary Sue Coleman,
Rodriguez or Bill Martin himself. Don't let
the jealous, self-serving few tarnish and erode
the legacy and future of Michigan football.

An introduction to the Daily

Welcome back - or for those of you
who are new to the University, just
welcome.
The media often takes hits for
being more guarded than the organi-
zations they cover. We strive not to be
like that. We are a newspaper run by
students for students, and we try to
be as transparent as possible during
that mission.
As the new school year kicks off,
I wanted to take the opportunity to
explain what The Michigan Daily is
and how we are here to serve you.
Who we are:
Since 1890, the Daily has been the
largest newspaper on campus. For all
119 of those years, it has been man-
aged and edited exclusively by stu-
dents. The University doesn't have
any say about what we print or who
works for us, and we don't receive
financial help from the University,
student fees or partisan foundations.
In essence, we are your newspaper.
What our mission is:
We are here to make sure you get
the most out of your campus experi-
ence.
In the most basic sense, that means
letting you know what is going on at
the University and in Ann Arbor and
telling the stories that matter. But
it also means digging deeper - to
make sure your tuition is not wast-
ed, to ensure that University and
city administrators pay attention to

your interests, to protect the qual-
ity of your education and to expose
how the decisions that affect you are
made. We want to be your forum to
express your problems, concerns and
opinions.
We strive to do all of that in the
most fair, accurate and objective way
possible.
When we stray from that mis-
sion:
Call us out for it.
For the same reasons we hold other
campus institutions accountable for
their actions, we want you to hold us
accountable.
To do that, we need your help.
When we make a mistake, send us a
correction at corrections@michi-
gandaily.com. When you think
there is more to be said, send us a
letter at tothedaily@umich.edu or
arrange for a longer viewpoint by
e-mailing opinion@michigandaily.
com. When you just want to give me
an earful, write me at graca@michi-
gandaily.com or call me at 734-647-
3336.
We know we make mistakes. We
try to minimize those mistakes, cor-
rect them when they happen and
make sure we tell you about them
when we do. You can find a list of cor-
rections every day on Page 2. You can
also read more about the Daily's suc-
cesses and failures on our blog The
Editor's Page.

How you can help us:
Remember that this is your news-
paper. If you think we are running
it into the ground, you can single-
handedly change it. Any student -
journalism experience or not - is
welcome to join our staff. You can get
more information by visiting michi-
gandaily.com/join-us, stopping by our
offices at 420 Maynard St or attending
one of our informational meetings at
the following times:
" Today, Sept. 8 at 8 p.m.
" Wednesday, Sept. 9 at 8 p.m.
" Sunday, Sept.13 at 6 p.m.
" Monday, Sept. 14 at 8 p.m.
You can also suggest a story to us
anytime by e-mailing news@michi-
gandaily.com or calling the news-
room at 734-763-2459. We can't be
everywhere at once, so we need your
help to tell us where you think we
should be.
Please take me up on these things.
The Michigan Daily is here for all of
us. Itcan't be a quality resource unless
readers, writers and editors all take
on their share of the responsibility.

The combination of The Beatles and "Rock Band"
is a match made in harmony heaven
By David Watnick I Managing Arts Editor

There may be no such thing as a "can't
i miss" in the world of video games (or
anywhere else, for that
matter), but "The Beat-
les: Rock Band" is about
as close as they come. The Beatles:
Attaching the catalog, Rock Band
likenesses, aesthetic and
auraofthegreatestartists PS3/Xbox
in the history of popular 360/ Wi
music to one of the most MTV Games
accessible and engaging
formats in the gaming
world was an utter no-brainer.
The logic is condescendingly obvious: If
The Beatles' music is the most compelling

rock ever created, just imagine perform-
ing it yourself (without even having to be
competent on a real instrument). Better
yet, imagine being a Beatle without having
to leave the living room or put on a black
suit (although dressing in-character seems
like the logical next step by the time you've
reached the Shea Stadium chapter). The
pairing of The Beatles with "Rock Band"
is, of course, stellar. It's almost as perfect
a match as John Lennon and Paul McCart-
ney were.
Time might as well cease for the opening
sequence, in which an animated montage
depicting The Beatles up to their old antics
explodes forward to the opening chord of

"A Hard Day's Night." The attention-com-
manding lead-in epitomizes the attitude
of inevitable excellence that pervades the
entire game.
It's an all-around confident affair, reek-
ing of a creative team that knew it had an
obvious smash on its hands. Yet there are
no signs of complacency or lack of ambi-
tion: Every aspect of both the gameplay
and the menu screens is meticulously orna-
mented, from the "Getting Better" guitar
strum that plays every time a button is
pressed in the menu to the vintage out-of-
breath Paul McCartney introductions that
precede many songs. And the cut scenes
that run between chapters do a perfect job
of turning The Beatles' artistic and career
growth into the fantasy it always seemed to
be in real life.
Though the significant depth of the
game's artistic dimension goes furthest in
setting the atmosphere of total Beatleness,
harmony vocals
- the game's
only major
gameplay addi-
HOOL tion - are most
responsible for
giving players a
lifelike Beatles
musical expe-
rience. With

phrases in "The Beatles: Rock Band" that
can't be replicated with near-complete
authenticity.
Of course, the harmonies can be quite
difficult to hit, even after using the too-
brief harmony trainer tutorial (The Beat-
les' songwriting and recording legacy often
makes people forget they were exceptional
vocalists). Those extremely familiar with

able to find the harmony in most places, but
in some cases (like the close harmonies on
"I Saw Her Standing There" or the three-
part group wall of "If I Needed Someone")
only talented singers have a good chance of
nailing harmony parts. A solo mode allows
one to three singers to attempt onlya song's

main melody, but it makes songs seem frus-
tratingly abridged.
In theory, "The Beatles: Rock Band" can
support six players (three singers, guitar,
bass, drums), but any serious outfit will
want to invest in a few mic stands (or fash-
ion their own) in order tobecome a fabfour-
piece. Simultaneously singing and playing
an instrument is a tricky skill to master, but
anyone well-versed in Beatles lyrics should
have no trouble serving double duty after a
few evenings in the Cavern Club.
Unfortunately, the concentration
required to play the songs makes noticing
the gorgeous background animations near-
ly impossible. The scenes from the Cavern

Ofphilistines and
film connoisseurs

There's a scene in Noah
Baumbach's brilliant
"The
Squid and the '
Whale" where
the proudly_
cultured but
socially ineptt
father (Jeff
Daniels) calls-
his rebellious ANDREVV
son a "philis- LAPIN
tine." He spits out
the word - which refers to a per-
son with hostility or indifference
toward culture - and intends it to
be an insult. But to the kid, who
rejects the haughty, pretentious
world of intellectuals his father
inhabits, it's a compliment. He
wants to be a philistine.
We all have friends, family and
acquaintances who are philis-
tines. Maybe they've just never
been exposed to classic films,
music and books. Or maybe they
simply have no desire to be. And
you know what? There's nothing
wrong with that.
Or maybe you're a proud philis-
tine, reading this column for shits
and giggles. Here's an easy way to
tell: If you've never heard of the
film I referenced in the first para-
graph and couldn't care less about
it, you might fit the description.
And that's OK too.
I know a lot about movies, but
I also know enough about human
nature to realize that the tine-

Some of my friends can't remem-

unavoidable disconnect between

ARIES
(March 21 to April 19)
Do whatever you can to get organized
at work and at home, because you're
motivated to do this now. Therefore,
capitalize on this urge!
TAURUS
(April 20to May 20)
Make sure you take time out to have
some fun. Your sign likes good food,
good wine, good sex and a nice place to
live. Yay!
GEMINI
(May 21 to June 20)
Home, family and domestic situations
are your top priorities now. Don't ignore
them. Discussions with family members
could be significant today.
CANCER
(June 21 toJuly 22)
Because this is a busy time for you -
with short trips, errands and increased
reading and talking to others - get in
the groove! Don't stay at home. Hustle
thy buns!
LEO
(July 23to Aug. 22)
Continue to focus on cash flow and
financial matters. Stay on top of your
money scene. Look for ways to boost
your income.
VIRGO
(Aug. 23 to Sept. 22)
Remember that the Sun is in your sign
now, giving you increased energy and
drawing powerful people and favorable
situations to you. By all means, milk this
for all it's worth! (And happy birthday.)
LIBRA
(Sept. 23 Ia Oct. 22)
Werk alone or behind the scenes as
much as possible now, because you need
to reserve your energy. In a few weeks,
you're going to step out onto center
stage when the Sun enters your sign.

SCORPIO
(Oct. 23 to Nov. 21)
Others are ready to help you now.
That's why it's a good idea to share your
goals and dreams for the future with
them. (See what their feedback is.)
SAGITTARIUS
(Nov. 22 to Dec. 21)
Because people in authority tend to
notice you more than usual and because
they see you in such a favorable light,
ask for whatever you want. Odds are,
you will get it!
CAPRICORN
(Dec. 22 to Jan. 19)
Try to do something different today.
Go someplace you've never beenhbefore.
Vary your routine. You want adventure,
and you want to learn something new!
AQUARIUS
(Jan. 20 to Feb. 18)
Be patient withthose who have values
different from yours. I know this isn't
easy, but what else can you do? Why be
miserable?
PISCES
(Feb. 19to March 20)
Because the Sun is directly opposite
from you now, you can leam a lot about
how you relate to others. Partnerships
are very important right now.
YOU BORN TODAY You're drawnto
challenges because you love to see
whether you can overcome them. (That's
why you don't always take the straight-
est line between two points.) You're
extremely capable and talented.
However, you're private about your per-
sonal life. Interesting characters attract
you. In the next year, partnerships and
close friendships will he important.
(You'llenter new ones, leave old ones
and improve existing ones.)

THE NEW ROUTE NAVIGATING CAMPUS
WITHOUT 'THE LINK'
'r The Link, an Ann Arbor
HURON bus route known best by
its bright purple buses, i
LBT being rep aced by a new
LIBERTY University-operated ser-
~ vice for residents of the
NORTH Oxford area.
WILLIAM

r
s
r

The new route:
Monday- Friday, before classes (7:15 - 8:10
am) and after classes (5:20 pm - 2:00 am),
the Oxford Shuttle route serves Oxford
Housing, Trotter House, Shapiro Library,
Michigan Union, Kraus Building, CC Little,
East Quad (on East University) and Hender-
son House every 15 minutes. On class days
(Monday - Friday, 8:10 am - 5:20 pm), the
Oxford route drops the circuit around the
Diag, serving CC Little, East Quad, Hender-
son House, Oxford and Trotter House every
10 minutes. Upon arriving atthe Central
Campus Transit Center, the bus contin-
9ues to North Campus via the Northwood
Express route or the Diag to Diag Express,
depending on the time of day.

BUSES
From Page 1A,
Residence Hall and Henderson
House - a co-op. During classes,
between 8:10 a.m. and 5:20 p.m.,
the shuttle stops at C.C. Little,
East Quad, Henderson House,
Oxford Housing and the Trot-
ter House, dropping the circuit
around the Diag and increasing
its frequency with 10-minute
cycles.
Also, during classes, the
Oxford Shuttle picks up either
the Northwood Express or the
Diag-to-Diag Express route -
both University bus routes -
and continues to North Campus
upon arriving at C.C. Little.
The ability to go from the
Oxford area to North Campus
without a transfer is a huge
added convenience for students,
Lamb said.
Public Policy junior Noah
Neary, president of the Phi
Gamma Delta fraternity on
Oxford Road, whose members
frequently used the Link route to
get to class during the cold win-
ter months, said he prefers the
old system to the new shuttle,
although he said the shorter wait
times are "definitely an improve-
ment."

"The mainhdrawback is not
getting all the way to down-
town," he said, adding that he
and his fraternity brothers often
used the Link to reach restau-
rants and other businesses far-
ther away from campus.
Despite the loss of service to
the Kerrytown and Main Street
business districts, Oxford Hall
Director Christopher Beyer says
students should be happy about
the change.
"Personally, I think it's a
huge improvement," he said,
brushing off what he perceived
as anxiety about the change
among students. "I did actually
see a Facebook group that was
called 'Save the Link,' but they
probably didn't have good infor-
mation."
Beyer said that in the past
students have had problems get-
ting to class because they would
miss the Link or it would fill
up before they could get a seat.
Now, he said, these issues should
be less prevalent because of the
shorter wait times and larger
buses - the Link buses were 30
feet long and the Oxford Shuttle
is a 40-foot bus.
Lamb believes the transition
will go smoothly.
"I think it will serve the stu-
dents just fine," she said.

STATE STREET
From Page 1A
Lelcaj and her staff took over the
new space the first week of August
and officially opened Aug. 26.
Besides a change in venue, the
new restaurant features an expand-
ed breakfast and dinner menu,
and Lelcaj said there are still more
changes to come.
Lelcaj also plans to acquire a
liquor license that she said could
be granted sometime in early 2010.
If attained, Lelcaj said Sava's hours
would expand, staying open until 2
a.m.
As for Sava's prior home, specu-
lation around the addition of a
CVS/Pharmacy in the 209-211 S.
State St. building has been growing
since plans for the business were
approved by the Ann Arbor Historic
District Commission in May.
According to the commission,
the CVS/Pharmacy building plan -
pioneered by real estate developer
Velmeir Companies - is scheduled
to go before the planning commis-
sion on Sept. 15. Following approval

from the commission, the CVS/
Pharmacy plan would still require
approval from City Council.
The State Street corridor has
seen multiple business shifts the
past year aside from Sava's move
and Zanzibar's departure.
Steve & Barry's apparel shop
closed its doors and filed for bank-
ruptcy at the end of last year. M-Den
- the locally owned University of
Michigan apparel store - took over
the space at 303 S. State St.
In addition to M-Den, Great
Lakes Team Apparel at 309 S. State
St. recently took over the space
previously occupied by the Earl of
Sandwich, expanding its collection
to a 4,500-square-foot space and
sporting a new name, "All About
Blue."
Amer's Mediterranean Deli at 312
S. State St. added the Yogurt Rush
business in its store abouttwo weeks
ago, after customers started demand-
ing the frozen treat, according to
Amer's employee Ricardo Ortiz.
"The popularity of (the yogurt
demand) overwhelmed us," Ortiz
said.
Amer's now has three machines

and a self-serve toppings bar. Ortiz
said there has been a steady flow of
customers since the addition and
the response has been "pretty posi-
tive."
Amer's new yogurt menu follows
the addition of Swirlberry at 209 S.
State St. The frozen yogurt chain
previously existed only in Plum
Market grocery stores - the first
located in West Bloomfield and the
second in Ann Arbor.
Swirlberry opened about two
months ago and prices by weight,
just like Amer's. Swirlberry charges
65 cents per ounce and charges 49
cents per ounce.
Swirlberry Manager Dave Vil-
laverde said the competition from
Amer's and Yogo Bliss - which
opened on South University Avenue
at the end of winter semester -
hasn't hurt Swirlberry's business.
"The fact that there's other plac-
es around doesn't really affect us at
all," he said. "Our product speaks
for itself."
Villaverde is also confident that
Swirlberry - which has been lik-
ened to other big city frozen yogurt
stores like Pinkberry and 16 Han-

dles - will come out a step above
the other stores.
"Imitation is the highest form of
flattery," he said.
Lelcaj said there is a certain
"revolving door" on State Street as
businesses come and go. She antici-
pates a different dynamic on the
street, though now that student
housing is in the immediate area.
4 Eleven Lofts opened for this
academic year, offering more than
300 spots for students just west of
South State Street and north of East
Washington Street. And the North
Quad Residence Hall is set to open
nearby in Fall 2010.
Because the new student housing
projects are north of Liberty Street,
Lelcaj believes that State Street
between East Washington Street
and Liberty Street will see more
people traffic and business.
"It's always been a bit differ-
ent," she said of the student traffic
on this part of State Street, recog-
nizing that before these projects,
most students traveling down State
Street have been graduate students
or theatre students living in the
neighborhood.

ROCK BAND
From Page 5A
Club, "The Ed Sullivan Show," Shea Stadium and Budo-
kan that accompany the first four chapters do a mar-
velous job of reviving the history they represent, and
their portrayals of The Beatles' mannerisms are hilari-
ously accurate. The Abbey Road "Dreamscapes" that
cover The Beatles' post-touring era songs are splendid
psychedelic mosaics - occasionally tacky but mostly
breathtaking (the passage accompanying the chorus-
es to "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" is a stunning
example.)
Whittling The Beatles' 200-something songs down
to a modest 45 for inclusion in the game is an unen-
viable task, but the producers did a commendable job
of balancing timeless classics (too many to name) and
deeper cuts ("And Your Bird Can Sing," "Hey Bulldog")
while also giving George and Ringo their dues.
Much has been made of the fact that "The Beatles:

Rock Band" will bring the music of The Beatles to a
new generation, but to labor over the social implica-
tions of the game would be to ignore its most impor-
tant attribute: It's unfathomably fun to play. It may
make new Beatles fans out of the uninitiated, but
lifelong Beatles fanatics are the ones who will truly
appreciate the game's magic. Sure, it includes unre-
leased Beatles photos and sound clips, but nobody
will care to pour over them - once people have begun
playing "The Beatles: Rock Band," they won't want to
stop.
Though internal strife in The Beatles' camp over the
years has lead to a lot of feet-dragging on new releas-
es, the exceptional greatness of the band's music has
supported every project The Beatles have ever been
attached to. And "The Beatles: Rock Band" is no excep-
tion. Like "The Beatles Anthology" series, "The Beat-
les: Rock Band" will go down next to all the original
Beatles LPs as indispensable. It should never - and
will never - go out of print, because it's an essential
part of the experience. And here's a tip: If you're play-
ing the bass, play left-handed.

A cute summer love
story that answers
no questions
By EMILY BOUDREAU
Daily Arts Writer
Love is not easily defined,
and in a similar respect, "Paper
Heart" is not a
movie that falls
into any clear
category. It is Paper Heart
neither docu-
mentary nor Atthe
mockumentary, Michigan
but an odd and Overture
intriguing com-
bination of both. Charlyne Yi
(Charlyne Yi, "Knocked Up") is a
girl who does not believe in love.
Trying to understand it, she goes
on a road trip with friend and
director Nicholas Jasenovec (Jake
M. Johnson, "Red Belt") to film
a documentary. Along the way,
Charlyne meets Michael Cera
(Michael Cera, "Year One") who
she may or may not love. Further
adding to the movie's mixture of
fiction and reality, Yi and Cera
dated in real life.
Needless to say, the pair has
nauseatingly cute on-screen

chemistry, but that's not due in
any way to either performer's
acting skills. Cera always plays a
character similar to himself, the
only difference is that this time
his character's name is actually
Michael Cera. Yi also plays her-
self, but her presence is far more
refreshing than Cera's. She is
awkward and endearing in a way
that Cera only wishes he could be.
Yi is particularly funny when she
interviews a gang of hairy, gritty
bikers and somehow ends up on
the back of a motorcycle. She even
interviews Seth Rogen and man-
ages to stand her own against his
massive comedic presence.
Though it plays a significant
role, the relationship between
Cera and Yi is not the film's main
appeal. While their romance
provides a potential but dubious
answer to whether or not Yi is
capable of loving another person,
the film could have been better
had their relationship been left
out of it completely.
As a matter of fact, some of the
best parts of the movie are when
neither Yi nor Cera is on screen.
"Heart" shines when couples or
individuals are filmed trying to
define love or share their stories
in the vein of "When Harry Met
Sally." Because of the combina-

tion of fact and fiction, the film
does not delve deeply into Yi's
documentary or her relationship
with Cera. It's neither a roman-
tic comedy nor an expose about
discovering the meaning of love.
Since Yi's interviews and encoun-
ters on her cross-country trip are
more engaging than the romantic
plot line, "Paper Heart" should
have stayed focused on discov-
ering the meaning and source of
love.
It may be shallow, but the film
is cute and thought-provoking.
It doesn't explore its subject -
love - too deeply, but it manages
to succeed by twisting real-life
truth with on-screen fiction. And
its funny vignettes featuring
paper cutouts communicate parts
of the story well.
"Paper Heart" is a sincere
movie, and the on-screen pres-
ence of Charlyne Yi gives it
an honesty and openness that
doesn't spoil the idea of love with
too many red roses and Hallmark
Valentine's Day cards. While nei-
ther the audience members nor
the film's performers will have
learned anything insightful by
the end of the movie, "Paper
Heart" does leave viewers with
the exciting sensation of a flour-
ishing summer fling.

SWINE FLU
From Page 1A
who are sick to either go home to
recuperate or, if that's not possible
- and there are a lot of students
where it wouldn't be feasible - to
stay in their apartments and ride
the flu out in isolation" Logan said.
He added that the residence
halls will be at full capacity and
that there is no space available
to isolate and quarantine stu-
dents to prevent the spread of
the virus.
Housing will provide meals to
students isolated in their residence
halls, so as not to infect healthy stu-
dents eating in the dining halls. Stu-
dents will be able to order meals on
the Housing website through Resi-
dential Dining Services, and food
will either be delivered to an ill stu-
dent's room or the student can have
a roommate or friend pick up food
from the closest dining hall.
Logan wrote in an e-mail that
the plan is tentative and can be
adjusted based on the amount of
students in isolation.
"If the scale of illness and in-
room meal requests gets so large
that this standard program is not
sufficient, University Housing will
then implement a plan for deliver-
ing meals to the residence halls,"
Logan wrote.
The University is also working
on developing an online communi-
cation database where ill students
can inform the University if they
are going home to recuperate or if
they will self-isolate themselves in
their rooms.
Earlier plans called for resident
advisers in residence halls to check
on sick students and communicate
the student's status to the Univer-
sity. But emergency planners later
decided that this system would not
be effective.
"RAs are students and they have
academic responsibilities as well,
and if they had to suspend this that
could be a problem," Logan said,
adding that resident advisers also
would have a greater chance of
becoming exposed to the virus.
TEST RUN
In July, the University's pre-
paredness plans were tested when
15 high school students attending
a summer program on campus
came down with the HiN1 virus.
The students were staying at Alice
Lloyd Residence Hall, but were
moved to an unoccupied residence
hall for a seven-day isolation peri-
od. The students recuperated after
about one week.
Winfield said they worked "very
aggressively" to contain the virus
and efforts were successful, but
more importantly, the outbreak
allowed for emergency coordina-
tors to evaluate their readiness
before this fall.
"We all did a gap analysis identi-
fying things where we recognized
we hadn't done sufficient planning
or the planning that we had done
wasn't quite perfect" 'Winfield
said. "We have been identifying
those gaps and have been address-
ing them all summer."
INFORMATION CAMPAIGN
As part of the University's over-
all strategy to fight the virus, the
Office of the Provost sent e-mails
to students, families, faculty and
staff that include information of

symptoms to look for, like a fever
over 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit,
sore throat, coughing, sneezing,
vomiting, headaches, muscle aches
and diarrhea.
The University is following
guidelines from the CDC, part of
which includes asking students
who become ill to self-isolate
themselves in their rooms for the
duration of the illness plus 24
hours after their fever ends.
Inan effort to prevent the spread
of germs, several committees have
designed personal hygiene posters
and mirror cling-ons that will be
placed in campus bathrooms. The
messages will remind students to
wash their hands regularly with
hot water and soap and cover their
cough.
Andrew Burchfield, manager of
emergency planning for the Uni-
versity, said these simple acts are
the most effective way to reduce
the spread of germs.
"(We're) just trying to keep that
constant reminder within people's
minds that washing their hands on
a regular basis is critical and cov-
ering your cough is also extremely
important," Burchfield said.
The HINi virus is similar to the
seasonal flu in that it can be trans-
mitted through surfaces or contact
with other ill people.
Robert Ernst, medical director
of University Health Service, said
washing your hands is the best way
to protect yourself from getting
influenza.
"Every time you shake hands
with somebody or touch surfaces
that are shared you run the risk
of picking up the virus on your
hands," Ernst said, "and if you
wash your hands in preferably hot

soapy water or alternatively with
some sort of hand sanitizer, you
reduce the riskthat your hands will
be contaminated."
Ernst added that coughing and
sneezing directly contaminates
other people and surfaces, so
coughing into a shoulder or sneez-
ing into a tissue can greatly cut
down the spread of germs.
UNIVERSITY HEALTH
SERVICE'S STRATEGY
UHS is asking students who
become sick with HINi to not
visit the health service unless they
are pregnant or have an underly-
ing condition as designated by the
CDC. These conditions include stu-
dents with diabetes, severe asthma,
HIV and immune deficiencies.
UHS will not prescribe Tamiflu,
the antiviral drug used to treat and
prevent H1N1, to all ill students. In
order to conserve supplies, only
those who fall under high-risk
categories like pregnant women,
people with underlying health con-
ditions and those at high risk who
are exposed to people who already
have HIN will receive medication.
"If your roommate gets H1N1
and you have asthma, we'll treat
you preventively," Winfield said.
"But in general, we're not going
to be giving Tamiflu to the gen-
eral public in order to conserve for
when we really need it."
According to Cindra James,
emergency preparedness coordina-
tor at the Washtenaw County Pub-
lic Health Department, the Health
Department has about 3,500 doses
of Tamiflu for Washtenaw County
residents, not including University
students. James said she expects
that total will be an adequate
amount to support the county.
"We have a stock pile here to
work with in the fall," James said.
"Should that dwindle and should

can always reapply and ask for
more."
Winfield said the University has
a short supply of Tamiflu that will
last if only those labeled as high-
risk by the CDC are prescribed
medication.
"We've been told we can get
more from the federal government
as we need it," he said. "So we're
pretty sure we will be OK, but we
aren't sure how much we're going
to able to get."
Ernst said the majority of
patients visiting UHS with HINT
have hadsymptoms similarto those
of people who get sick every year
from seasonal flu, including vomit-
ing and high fevers.
"The reassuring thing is that
most people who get H1N1 are not
getting seriously ill," he said. "The
actual manifestation of H1N1 infec-
tion in young people tends to be
not that different than the usual
seasonal influenza, meaning people
don't feel well for several days, but
they aren't being hospitalized at a
high percentage."
Treatments for H1Ni are also
comparable to those for the sea-
sonal flu as they include staying
well hydrated and taking medi-
cations with ibuprofen to reduce
fevers. Students can recuperate
without consulting a physician,
but students who fall into the
high-risk categories should visit
UHS, Ernst said.
"Who should go see the doctor
are those people who have under-
lying serious health conditions
- so diabetics, or people who are
on medications that may suppress
their immune system or people
who have underlying conditions
that are beingtreated for on a regu-
lar basis," he said.
Students who visit UHS seeking
treatment for H1N1 will be asked to
wear a mask to protect the health
care providers and healthy patients

"That's going to be one of our
concerns - protecting our staff and
protecting the other people in the
waiting rooms from people who
may be sick," Ernst said. "Wearing
a mask while they're in the building
is one way we can do that"'
In case the number of influenza
cases needing treatment becomes
increasingly high, UHS officials
are creating contingency plans
for limiting some of the more
routine types of care. Ernst cited
gynecological exams as one prac-
tice that could be put on hold if
UHS becomes overwhelmed with
influenza cases.
"We're creating continuity
plans to try and make sure we have
adequate staffing to handle what
we think might be a high level of
influenza cases," Ernst said. "If that
occurs, we may have to put offsome
types of elective visits.'
But Ernst said that will only hap-
pen if the volume of cases becomes
"critical.'
The likelihood that the situation
gets to that point is up in the air,
though, as there's no way to predict
how large the outbreak will be on
campus, Burchfield said.
"We really don't know how bad
it's going to be - if it's going to be
bad, if it's going to be really bad,
it's somewhat of a guessing game
in waiting to see what the results
are," Burchfield said. "But I think
overall, the University of Michigan
has done a tremendous job in pre-
paring and thinking about as many
issues and making sure that we're
keeping our students, faculty and
staff as safe as possible.'

A day in
the life
of a Cape
Leaguer
By NICOLE AUERBACH
Daily Sports Editor
WAREHAM, Mass. - Ryan La-
Marre didn't take out his golf clubs
until the beginning of August.
Golfing is just a hobby to him, so
that wasn't necessarily a problem.
But for someone spending an entire
summer on Cape Cod, the home of
many sprawling golf courses, it was
certainly surprising.
Ryan, the junior starting cen-
terfielder for the Michigan base-
ball team, played for the Wareham
Gatemen in the vaunted Cape Cod
Baseball League this summer.
Widely considered the nation's
top amateur summer league, the
Cape League boasts 10 teams filled
with the best collegiate baseball
players. It's known for wooden bats,
MLB draft hopes and tough com-
petition - and the movie Summer
* Catch. Only two Michigan players
earned roster spots on Cape League
teams this summer, Ryan and relief
pitcher Tyler Burgoon.
The normal season includes 44
games in two months with plenty
of time for off-days. But this past
summer, one marked by torrential
rain instead of sunshine, rainouts
and subsequent doubleheaders
provided even more challenges for
Cape League players to overcome.
So if that meant no golfing on off-
days, so be it. Dry days meant base-
ball, and baseball provided a chance
to get noticed by scouts and coaches.
Cape Cod, the vacation hotspot, was
a place for work, not play.
While many on the Cape this
summer enjoyed beaches, par 4s
and sunsets, Ryan was focusing on
the barrel.

Daily Sports Writer
It was a simple sign of affection.
But for David Merritt, a captain
of last year's Michigan basketball
team who recently graduated, it
represented more.
In September 2008, Merritt re-
ceived a text message from a friend
that read: "IMU." In tech-speak,
those three letters represent the
phrase, "I miss you," which provid-
ed inspiration for a future idea.
After some work and planning,
Merritt launched his company
IMU on Friday night at the Michi-
gan League in front of a crowd
that included several of his former
teammates and coaches.
Merritt's company currently
sells T-shirts exclusively online,

where it has 10 different T-shirt
designs, five for men and five for
women. The designs range from
the plain IMU logo to shirts with
quick sayings and unique designs.
The mission of IMU is "to spread
happiness while appreciating the
people and experiences who make
us who we are." IMU is different
from other apparel companies -
Merritt said "care" was the word
that best described the company.
The twist that differentiates it from
other apparel companies is that ev-
ery full-time employee must serve
8 to 10 hours of community service
per month.
But the "care" doesn't stop
there.

Wolverines win

It was an odd feeling, coming into
a season opener against a Mid-Amer-
ican Conference team with absolutely
no idea what to expect.
An offense dependent on
two true freshman quarter-
backs, a defense that Michigan

little depth and a team that faced a
tumultuous week of allegations can be
thanked for that.
But somewhere in the first 15 minutes
of the Wolverines' opener against West-
ern Michigan on Saturday, they managed
to make everything look easy again.
"It feels -it feels good," redshirt soph-
omore wide receiver Junior Hemingway
said after the game, pausing as he tried
to find the right words. "I don't want to
say it feels weird, but it kind of feels like
I'm starting over again, and I think I just
want to start it off right this time."
Hemingway was referring to how
frequent injuries have prevented him
from makinga real impact until his sur-
prising two-touchdown performance
Saturday. But he may as well have been
talking about the entire team's fresh
start.
The offense was flashy, scoring 31
points before halftime with quarter-
backs Denard Robinson and Tate Forci-
er putting on a show in their debuts
- Robinson with his quick feet and
Forcier with his confident decision-

The defense was fierce, making
Western Michigan quarterback Tim

and couldn't hold onto the ball.

its season Saturday with a 31-7 win over
the Broncos, its first home opener vic-
tory in three years.
This fresh start showed little indica-
tion oflast year's season-opening issues
- excessive turnovers, shaky quarter-
backs, offensive line woes and fumbled
punt returns.
Instead, it highlighted what wasn't
possible during all of last year's 3-9 di-
saster.Rodriguez gave four quarterbacks
playing time, not because anyone was
underperforming, but simply because
with a 24-point lead, he could afford to.
Fans held pro-Rodriguez signs and
loudly chanted his name twice, once
after Hemingway's second touchdown
and the other in the waning seconds
of the game. The two skyboxes may
have kept in extra crowd noise, but the
109,019 fans didn't need the help.
And the old Michigan swagger re-
turned, from Forcier's bold postgame
comment that he doesn't get nervous -
"never have and I don't thinkI ever will"
- to veteran players like senior defen-
sive end Brandon Graham pumping his
arms in the air between plays to make
the crowd roar just a little louder.
After Western Michigan started the
game with a three-and-out, Forcier
wasted no time leading Michigan to a
score on its first drive. From the 28-yard
line, the freshman started to run the ball

Ohio State football coach Jim Tressel had Navy run out of the Ohio Stadium tunnel with the Buckeyes on Saturday.

acknowledged the pregame sports-
manship initiative.
On Saturday all over the coun-
try, college football teams lined up
midfield, shook hands and passed
on a "Good Luck." It's a small, sim-
ple gesture that I think could have
major dividends.
College football is one of the
most passionate, emotion-fueled
sports there is, and that can defi-
nitely getthe better of players mid-
game. In 2003, Robert Reynolds, a
hot-headed Ohio State linebacker,
choked Wisconsin quarterback Jim
Sorgi in a dogpile during the game.
In 2006, Miami and Florida Inter-
national suspended a combined 31
players after an on-field brawl. The
problem hasn't escaped Michigan
- wide receiver Greg Mathews
appeared to kick an Oregon defen-

sive back after a reception in 2007.
Heck, even I've lost my cool in
the heat of the moment. During my
senior year of high school, I had a
blatant roughing the passer penal-
ty after going after our archrival's
quarterback.
A pregame handshake could
- if teams continue to commit to
them - humanize the opposing
team. Players can look each other
in the eyes before the game and see
they're people, not just uniforms.
Of course, it didn't work for
Blount, but let's just put an asterisk
on that one and push it to the side.
Instead, look to a certain team
in Columbus that Michigan fans
don't like very much.
Say what you will about Jim
Tressel and Ohio State (and if
you're reading The Michigan Daily,
it's probably negative), their pre-
game pageantry against Navy on
Saturday was a really classy move.
Both teams met to shake hands
well before the game. Then, the
Buckeyes and Midshipmen ran
out of the tunnel together, the first
time that's ever happened in 88
years of football at Ohio Stadium.
When Ohio State runs out of the
tunnel, it's a big deal - just try to
imagine Western Michigan run-
ning through the band and touch-
ing the "Go Blue" banner with
Michigan.
I've been to The 'Shoe. It's not a
friendly place. When Texas trav-
eled there in 2005, Longhorns fans
were so appalled at the Buckeyes'
fans that it led to Ohio State Presi-
dent Karen Holbook issuing a pub-
lic apology.
To see 105,000 Buckeyes fans

applaud for Navy - whether or
not it was accidental, because Ohio
State was simultaneously being
introduced - was really special.
I don't know if the action had
any influence on the outcome ofthe
game, but to extend such a gesture
to the opposing team can only lead
to good things for college football
as a whole.
Michigan's celebration of
Sportsmanship Week was much
more subdued. In fact, if you
weren't payingattention, you prob-
ably missed it. A spokesman for the
Athletic Department said he wasn't
sure if the teams ever talked about
a full-team pre-game handshake,
but Michigan coach Rich Rodri-
guez and Western Michigan coach
Bill Cubit met on the 'M' before
the coin toss and exchanged well
wishes.
I wish Michigan would have had
the teams meet before the game
and made a bigger deal of the hand-
shake initiative, but not necessarily
blow it up as big as Ohio State did.
With so much hype surrounding
the Wolverinesgoing into the game,
it would be been nice to see them
take a breather and meet Western
before kickoff.
The Wolverines didn't have to
sacrifice the sanctity of their pre-
game ritual. No one is asking that.
But a simple handshake could have
gone a long way.
- Reid will shake hands with the
State News players before the annual
Daily-State News flag football game
on Oct. 2, but only because he's trying

Reloaded Michigan off to
fast start in'09 campaign

New contributors in
defense, midfield lead Blue
to early-season success
By CHAN TEL JENNINGS
Daily Sports Writer
One season removed from losing two star
players to Major League Soccer and falling short
of the Big Ten Title, the Wolverines are back in
their 10th year as a varsity program.
Just three games into the season, No. 22
Michigan has already taken down one top-25
team and started its charge toward its second
consecutive NCAA Tournament appearance.
YOUNG GUNS
Even with nine true freshmen on the roster,
Michigan men's soccer coach Steve Burns is
not surprised with the group's on-field results.
Three freshmen in particular have shined on a
roster showing veteran characteristics.
"They really don't have any fear in how they
play," Burns said.
Freshman Latif Alashe has started every
game for the Wolverines at center midfield,
filling the wide gap left by now-graduated Alex
Morisset. Alashe's ability to control the middle
of the field, along with a natural ability to get
in the box and create offensive opportuni-
ties, gave him two goals during the exhibition
schedule.
Freshman Kofi Opare has surprised the
coaches with his versatility on the field. Recruit-

ed as a defender, the Niagara Falls, Ont. native
has found himself playing everywhere from out-
side back to defensive midfielder to forward.
A help to Alashe in the middle of the field,
freshman Hamoody Saadhas provided cool com-
posure for the team. The wide midfielder has a
rare ability to control the tempo of the game.
"The game can be hectic around him, but
once he can put his foot on the ball, everything
is calm," Burns said.
With so many talented freshmen, expect the
Wolverines to make leaps and bounds as the sea-
son progresses and the young players gain expe-
rience.
OFFENSE
With the loss of Marosevic, who had 13 goals
last season, a space opened up for senior Mauro
Fuzetti. The forward has leaped out of Maros-
evic's shadow and provided much of the offense
for the Wolverines, with two goals and an assist
so far this year.
Coupled with Fuzetti up front is junior
college transfer Justin Meram. The junior
led Yavapai College to back-to-back nation-
al championships during his freshman and
sophomore seasons and was named the 2008
National Junior College Player of the Year
last year. Described as a "natural scorer" by
Burns, the forward's technical play should
combine nicely with Fuzetti's speed and flare
for the game to create an exceptional offen-
sive tandem.
Michigan will also have offensive depth
with redshirt juniors Matt Schmitt and Cam
Cameron and junior Chase Tennant. Ten-

nant, back from a two-year Mormon mission
trip and currently overcoming a lingering
ankle injury, is only at 75 percent, but still
scored the game winner against Drake on Fri-
day. Cameron had two goals and four assists
last season while Schmitt had one goal and
seven assists.
With two big offensive threats in Fuzetti and
Meram, other teams will have difficulty match-
ing both players. Look for this pair to lead the
team in scoring while also creating offensive
opportunities for teammates.
DEFENSE
After starting the regular season with a 5-0
loss to Notre Dame, the Wolverine defense has
focused on being more aggressive and physical,
a goal that Burns will continue to stress to his
team as the season progresses.
"I thought coming out of preseason ... that the
strength of our team was our defense," Burns
said. "And then for Notre Dame to open us up the
way they did in the second half was definitely
concerning."
Since the Sept.1 Notre Dame loss, the Wolver-
ine defense has allowed just seven shots on goal
in two games.
Anchored by fifth-year senior captain Danny
Gray, the defense is filled by strong, dominant
players such as junior Adam Keller and senior
Julian Robles.
New inthe netfor Michigan isredshirt sopho-
more Chris Blais, who has improved each year
with the Wolverines.
"He's confident," Burns said. "He's sure-
handed."

SAID ALSALAH/Dail
Senior forward Mauro Fuzetti is one of several Wolverines expected to shoulder a
larger load this season.

behind Valparaiso (1-1-0) on every
loose ball. Crusader junior forward
Zack Stivers slipped by the Michi-
gan defense and scored in the 39th
minute.
After a half of uninspired play,
the Wolverines finally awoke from
their slumber and recaptured
control of the game. Gray and fel-
low senior defender Julian Robles
led the locker room talk and then
guided their team with outstand-
ing play.

"When (Gray's) teammates see
him pulling in a tackle, putting his
body at risk and popping back up,
and then giving them a little fist
pump, they really respond to that
on the field," Michigan coach Steve
Burns said.
Michigan dominated the time of
possession in the second half, and
in the 70th minute, the Wolverines
tied the game at one. Senior for-
ward Mauro Fuzetti received the
ball in the box, and in one motion,
turned and struck the ball just

inside the left post..
"I have an eye for the goal," he
said. "I always know where I am on
the field, and what I need to do to
get a shot on target."
Fuzetti has scored in each of
the last two games and has cre-
ated many scoring opportunities
throughout the Wolverines' young
season. Just two minutes after
tying the game, he blew by his
defender and lightly passed the ball
to junior forward Justin Meram,
who delivered the eventual game

winner.
"Mauro is probably the most
technical player on our team,"
Burns said. "He can hold the
ball under a lot of pressure. He's
extremely quick and has great agil-
ity, and if he can get you off balance,
he can blow by guys."
Fuzetti's outstanding play
enabled the Wolverines to return
with a victory to Ann Arbor, where
they will play their first home game
of the season against Wright State
on Friday.

A defense that surrendered a school-
record 28.9 points per game last season
and returned just four starters to their
positions isn't upposed Cu look tunning
in its home opener.
It shouldn't hold a highly toutedsenior
quarterback and potential NFL draftee
to 13-for-24 passing and 81 yards in the
first half.
And it certainly doesn't come within
nine minutes of its first shutout in the
Rich Rod era.
"If anybody's surprised, it's y'all,"
junior safety Troy Woolfolk said after
the Michigan football team's 31-7 win
over WesternMichigan."I knew we were
all playing for this team, and I knew this
defense was going to be good."
Criticisms of inexperience and lack of
depth have surrounded the defense for
months. But Saturday, in front of 109,019,
the debut of first-year coordinator Greg
Robinson's new defense put at least some
of those concerns at bay.
The one glaring concern is that the
Wolverines are just an injury away from
major defensive problems, particularly
in the secondary. That was made clear by
redshirt freshman cornerback J.T. Floyd's
botched coverage in the fourth quarter,
leadingto a 73-yard touchdown pass from
Bronco quarterback Tim Hiller.
But the starting corps, slowly erased
memories of last season's defensive
debacle by holding Western Michigan to
3-and-outs on six of eight drives in the
first half.
"I just think that we're young and
we're learning how to play together
in a system that they haven't played in
before," Robinson said of the defense.
"There's a learning curve. And I think
the guys are doing a pretty good job of
adapting."
The cornerback tandem of junior
Donovan Warren and sophomore Bou-
bacar Cissoko held the Broncos' receiv-
ers in check with on-point tackling, and
Cissoko delivered with a first-quarter
interception that left Robinson jump-

before spotting Hemingway near
the left sideline, a play that Heming-
way later called an "improvisation".
Forcier threw the ball on the run to
Hemingway, who easily ran into the
end zone.
And just three and a half minutes
later, Robinson scored on his firstplay
at quarterback in a way that only the
freshman known for his speed could.
On an intended reverse to sophomore
slot receiver Martavious Odoms, Rob-
inson dropped the snap but had time
to pick up the ball, stand still to plot
his course, and zig-zag past the Bron-
cos for a 43-yard touchdown run.
"I was asking Denard on the side-
line if that little fake fumble and run-
ning for a touchdown was a habit,
because he's done it to us a couple
times (in practice)," senior linebacker
Stevie Brown laughed.
Forcier felt the same way.
"God," Forcier said, laughing. "I
was happy, but it's nothing, I wasn't
impressed by it. I've seen it happen,
I've seen him do it so many times
in practice, it's typical for him to do
that."
At the half, after two more Forcier

touchdown passes, Michigan had al-
ready racked up 289 total yards (144
rushing and 145 passing yards). The
Wolverines finished with 439 total
yards, more than they could manage
in any of their 12 games last year.
But in the second half, where Ro-
driguez said he "really wasn't happy
with anything," Michigan failed to
convert twice in the red zone and
only combined for 150 total yards.
The Wolverines' shutout hopes were
dashed in the fourth quarter when
Hiller lofted a perfect 73-yard touch-
down pass to wide-open wide receiv-
er Juan Nunez.
After it was all over, the atmo-
sphere in the Big House felt more like
the Wolverines had just beaten a top-
tier Big Ten team. But even with con-
fidence in Ann Arbor back for now,
the lasting sting of last year's record
meant nobody was going to take Sat-
urday's win for granted.
"It meant a lot - just kind of an-
swered alot of questions, like wheth-
er or not there's division on this team,
whether or not we worked hard
enough, whether or not, whether or
not, whether or not," redshirt junior
linebacker Obi Ezeh said. "So you
don't need to hear it from us. If you
want to ask any more questions, just
watch the game."

REID
From Page 1B
"This game, it's going to go
to everybody's film room, and
everybody's going to watch
it" safety Troy Woolfolk said.
"(Every) team is going to
see that we're back, the old
Michigan is back, and we're
ready for a big season."
The Old Michigan, on the
scoreboard, at least. No three-
yards-and-a-cloud-of-dust.
Without the mindset that the
forward pass might as well
still be illegal.
The atmosphere at the
Big House, which was sorely
lacking last season, was also
back. Especially after the
game when fans cheered
"Beat the Irish" as the team
sang the fight song in front of
the student section.
Last season, the game
against Ohio State almost
seemed dreaded. This year,
the swagger surrounding ri-
valry games (lest we forget the
"Little Brother" antics of Mike
Hart) is back in full force.
"I can't wait - we owe

them. We owe them," running
back Mike Shaw said when
asked about Notre Dame
and the Wolverines' 35-17,
six-turnover thumping last
season. He grinned and ran
into the tunnel of Michigan
Stadium to undoubtedly
celebrate in the deservedly
raucous locker room.
All offseason, the team has
talked about buying into the
new Michigan. On Saturday,
the fans proved they've done
so, too. It's a huge step in
restoring Rich Rodriguez's
program.
I was concerned with how
Michigan fans would respond
to Rodriguez after everything
that's happened in the last
week or so. How would a fan-
base not used to anything but
success react to a coach who's
seen anything but that since
coming to Michigan?
As I walked from my house
near East Quad a few hours
before the game, the answer
was made crystal clear -
Wolverine nation is backing
its coach.
The pro-Rich Rod para-
phernalia ranged from the

serious:
The enormous "In Rod We
Trust" banner flownby the
tunnel in the stadium.
To the outraged:
A minivan park at Ann Ar-
bor Pioneer displayed a sign
that read, "Boycott the Free
Press NOW"
To the ridiculous:
A sign read "(Free Press
writer Mike) Rosenberg
Punches Dolphins" at the
BOX House on State Street.
And after Tate Forcier's
third touchdown pass of the
day - a beautifully thrown,
44-yard bomb to Junior
Hemingway - all 109,019 fans
officially made their support
for Rodriguez known. All
throughout the stadium, a
chant of the coach's name
became louder and louder.
"It's amazing the support
that we've gotten," Rodri-
guez said. "And they can say
my name but it's really to
Michigan. We talked all week
about winning and winning
for Michigan"

The Michigan Daily football writers break down the weekend's stats that don't show up in the box score. The Mesk-o-Meter measures the Wolverines' success on special teams, the

MESK-O-METER

4/4
Zoltans

The special teams performance was worlds better
than in last year's season opener - the Wolverines
didn't drop any punts, they made their only field-goal
attempt and Zoltan Mesko averaged 47.2 yards
per punt. It was nothing flashy, but it worked.

ROD-O-METER
2 / Despite all the pro-Rich Rod signs and chants during the
game, Rodriguez was surprisingly blase during his post-
game press conference. He didn't crack his usual jokes
Rich Rods following a win, but then again, he's been under a lot of
pressure lately. It must have been nice tojust breathe.

HYPE-O-METER
4/4 The student section arrived well before kickoff, packed
j the stadium and screamed for nearly the entire game.
Big Houses Even with a 31-point lead, the crowd was still louder
than during much of last season. You've set the bar
high now, students. Don't let us down next week.

A day in the life of Wolverine-turned-Cape Cod Leaguer Ryan LaMarre

COURTESY OF
JENN DERBY DRINKWATER
NICOLE AUERBACH/Daily
July 28,2009:10:45 a.m., Gleason Family YMCA
It's a typical game day, which means that the nine hours at the field (early hitting, regular batting practice and
the actual game) aren't enough.
So Ryan and roommate Scott Rembisz, a reliever for Wareham and a junior at Florida International, head to
the local gym.
The Cape League regular season is nearing its two-month mark, so everyone in town knows who plays for the
Gatemen. Ryan and Scott wave hello to the YMCA's receptionist (who wishes them good luck tonight) slide their
membership cards through the card reader and walk toward the weight room.
Entering the two-partweight room, Ryan immediately puts down his protein drink and car keys and heads to
the stationary bike for a quick warmup.
Forty-five minutes pass in a blur of bench pressing, bicep curls and abdominal workouts.
"Mention that I lift more now than when I work out with (Michigan first baseman Mike) Dufek," Ryan says
with a smile.
In the middle of the workout, Ryan and Scott are joined by Wareham teammates "Swags" and "Willy" - Jor-
dan Swagerty and Zach Wilson, both from Arizona State.
It's a short workout overall, because, as all four guys say, the previous day's one was brutal and left them all
sore.
A few more employees wish the pair good luck in tonight'sgame as the two roommates walk out of the YMCA.
Sure, they're wearing Gatemen T-shirts - but they like to think of it as a sort of local celebrity thing.
Ryan pauses near the door.
"Don't forget to mention that Dufek thing."
12:45 p.m., Sand & Surf Mini Golf
After a quick sandwich pickup from the local pizza place and a stop home to say hello to Ryan and Scott's host
family, the guys decide to kill some time before early hitting practice.
Ryan mentions that his three-year-old host sister learned how to turn on the heat the night before, which
doesn't make his basement bedroom living situation any more comfortable. He sleeps on an air mattress while
Scott takes the futon. The other half of the basement is a sort of family room, complete with a mini-kitchen, a
pair of couches and a TV. Living with two host siblings and two host parents, finding privacy can be a challenge
for both Ryan and Scott.
Ryan's Yukon XL is air conditioned, so it's a vital part of the plan to kill time. A drive around Wareham - past
the Chili's, Walmart and various other restaurants and convenience stores - invites some topics of conversation
about the town.
"I feel like everyone has tattoos and wears wife-beaters," Ryan says. "If you don't have a tattoo, you don't fit
in.
It's a bit of an exaggeration, but not off by much. Wareham is very different from the rest of the towns that host
teams in the Cape League. It's the only one technically off the Cape. To get there requires a trip over either the.
Bourne or Sagamore bridges, both of which are known for heavy traffic. Bus trips for away games can be brutal.
It can take more than an hour and a half to play in Orleans, the easternmost team in the league.
"Can't blame us for our bad road record," Ryan says.
And it's easy to agree. Four teams (Chatham, Orleans, Harwich and Brewster) are all within 15 minutes of one
another, so the Gatemen can feel like outsiders in the league sometimes.
But what also makes Wareham stand out is that it does have a different local crowd than many of the other
Cape towns. In Chatham, the town the movie Summer Catch is set in, the town is filled with alot of polo-wear-
ing, preppy vacationers. In Wareham, it's a different brand of locals.
Ryan sees a miniature golf course and pulls in. Besides the fact that it's hot out, mini golf seems like the perfect
activity to kill an hour.
As Scott lines up for his first shot, Ryan starts pretendingto be a golf announcer, giving play-by-play of Scott's
first putt. He gives up after a few minutes, and instead decides to focus on beating his roommate.
The two aren't having their best day of putt-putt - each suffers a couple of 6's - but nonetheless, they remain
tied after 18 holes. Of course, this means they must have a one-hole playoff. Scott wins.

1:30 p.m., Locker room
It's officially sweltering. The iPhone weather app says it's 83 degrees with 67 percent humidity. Ryan and
Scott head into the Gatemen's locker room to change for the optional early hitting practice. Even though it's
not mandatory, Ryan says basically everyone goes - or at least everyone who wants to play that night.
About two-thirds of the team has already shown up for early hitting, and a scout sits perched in the first-
base bleachers, clearly here early to check outa particular player.
Ryan wonders if the scout's presence means he and his teammates won't be able to multitask this afternoon
- they like to take batting practice shirtless so they can work on their tans, too.
It doesn't seem to be a problem, and the scorching sun leads many players to hit and field balls in just gym
shorts and sneakers. They don't necessarily look like baseball players.
But way behind them in the distance, each player's meticulously-kept white home jersey hangs from the
outfield fence, drying in the sun in preparation for the evening's game.
3:20 p.m., Clem Spillane Field
Wareham manager Cooper Farris is pitching from behind a protective net, and Ryan stands in the batting
cage that surrounds home plate.
After almost two hours of shagging fly balls in the outfield, Ryan's group has finally reached its turn to hit.
In Ryan's second round of swings, he struggles. After a bloop hit to right field, Farris tells him to pause.
"Show me your barrel," Farris says.
Ryan goes through a slow-motion swing, freezing at the invisible point of contact.
On the next live pitch, Ryan lines the ball right back at Farris' pitching net.
Then, he smashes three straight balls to dead center, inciting a loud primal yell from Farris.
After two more consecutive home runs over the deep left centerfield fence, one of Ryan's teammates jokes,
"Well, that's a pretty good swing."
The conversation between hitting sessions is all over the place. Indiana pitcher Blake Monar brings up
politics, as he often does, which starts as a conversation about "Obama fans" and the economy in the 1990s
and evolves into a chat about which Gatemen player would make the best president. Texas pitcher Brandon
Workman confidently claims he'd eliminate the terrorism problem.
7:00 p.m., A more-crowded Clem Spillane Field
After another round of batting practice and pre-game warmups inthe field, it's finally game time. Wareham
is hosting the Yarmouth-Dennis Red Sox, home of another Michigan player: fellow junior Tyler Burgoon.
The Red Sox are on a tear, in the midst of a seven-game win streak. Burgoon leads the league in saves and
has recently been selected as an Eastern Divison All-Star. Y-D's starter and the eventual Cape League pitcher
of the year is Chris Sale, a towering left-hander from Florida Gulf Coast.
But the Gatemen have one of their best pitchers on the mound, Vanderbilt's Jack Armstrong.
Ryan has been hitting well as of late. He struggled early in the season to adjust to the wooden bats while
facing the nation's top collegiate pitchers. But now, as evidenced by batting practice bombs, his swing is back
in top form. Michigan's leading hitter (.344 average, 12 home runs) has officially arrived on the Cape.
But Ryan's first at-bat is a rough one. He strikes out on a foul-tipped third strike and comes backto the dug-
out angrythat he missed the pitch.
An inning later, he and teammates discuss Sale as they lean on the dugout fence and spit sunflower seeds.
The consensus is that Sale's throwing pretty much everything for strikes, but he's also gettingsome help from
the umpires. In the third inning, Ryan sees that firsthand as he's called out on strikes looking. He's furious -
"There's no way that was a strike" and "It was four inches outside" he says to teammates as he re-enters the
dugout. See LAMARRE, Page 9B

Carron added another goal and
two assists in the Wolverine's win

had one career goal entering the
season.
"(Ryan has) just pushed me to

her coach's impact. "Every day, he

Ryan also thinks Carron canplay

team. He pushed her to play for the
top women's club team in the coun-

With Carron's help, they won the
United Soccer Leagues' W-League

"A lot ofkids are comingto Mich-

to come here because they want to
have a coach and a coaching staff
that has international experience."
While Ryan is developing the
young talent he has at Michigan,
Carron is roaming the field as the
last line of defense for the Wolver-
ines. And as the team continue to
have growing pains, Carron can be
a calming force on the team.
"I just don't know what we
would do without Jackie Carron,
and I know about 26 other girls
over there that feel the same way,"
Ryan said.

Runners sweep top
three spots in
Michigan Open
By KEVIN RAFTERY
For the Daily
Last week, the Michigan wom-
en's cross country team returned
to Ann Arbor from a grueling week
of camp. Less than 24 hours later,
the Wolverines competed against
Eastern Michigan for their first
meet of the year in the 5,000-meter
Michigan Open at Hudson Mills
Metropark in Dexter.
But Michigan showed few signs
of fatigue as eight runners finished
in the top 10. Junior Danielle Tauro
led the pack, finishing first with a
time of 18:00.5. Tauro, who will
be counted on as the Wolverines'
leader this year, said that it was
more important for her team to
gain experience than to finish with
impressive times.
"This meet is definitely low-
key," Tauro said through the Ath-
letic Department. "We got back

yesterday, and then it was move-in.
So with this meet, our top prior-
ity isn't really to run fast, it's more
about getting a race under our belt
before the big meets get going."
Taura's performance was closely
followed by freshmen Jillian Smith
(t8:11.4) and Raitlyn Patterson
(18:11.8), who finished second and
third, respectively. The freshmen
will be a big part of Michigan's suc-
cess this year, since 16 of 27 athletes
on the Wolverines' roster are fresh-
men.
Michigan Coach Mike McGuire
was happy with his team's perfor-
mance, particularly the freshmen.
"We've got a good group," he
said. "We're in a position this year
where we're going to need help
from the freshmen. They're defi-
nitely going to be called upon, and
I think they'll be equal to the chal-
lenge."
It was a promising start for the
Wolverines, who will look to build
on that in preparation for the Spar-
tan Invitational on Sept. 18.
"We've established the bench-
mark," McGuire said, "and we've
just got to get better from here."

LAMARRE j From page 6B
8:10 p.m., Dugout
Ryan isn't the only one frustrated tonight. After allowing three runs that could have been avoided with
crisper defense, the pitcher Armstrong is pulled from the game. He throws drinks, slams his glove dpwn and
yells before storming out of the dugout after the third inning.
"I've never seen him like that," Wareham's athletic trainer says.
The Gatemen are struggling against Sale but they have managed to put three early runs across, so it's tied
when Armstrong leaves the game - and stays that way through the middle innings. Ryan's third at-bat results
in a hit-by-pitch in the fifth inning, but he's stranded.
The mood in the dugout starts to sour after Armstrong is taken out of the game. At this point, many players
are still hitless and these guys aren't used to that. There's a lot of cursing, helmet throwing and complaining
from both the players and the coaches.
Y-D takes a 4-3 lead in the eighth inning, and a four-run ninth puts the game away for the Red Sox. By the
end of the game, hardly any Wareham players are leaning on the fence. Many of them, Ryan included, are sit-
ting with their heads in their hands on the bench.
Isn't this just a regular season game? N E E D
9:45 p.m., Outfield grass ______ -"
For Wareham, it's just one loss to the hottest team in the league. But for Farris, it's a brutal one. He holds his
team in a postgame meeting for more than 20 minutes.
The entire Y-D team already boarded its bus and left, meaning Ryan didn't get to say hello to his Michigan
teammate.
After the long, grave team huddle, the Gatemen players scatter, gather their equipment and head to the
locker room. ALL INCLUSIVE RAT ASLOW AS
Most of them shower, change into street clothes and check text messages. It's been more than eight hours
at the field for many players. Host parents and team volunteers start spreading the word that the team's post- -
game dinner will be at Lindsey's Family Restaurant, and that there's good seafood there. --
Since 1:15 p.m., Ryan and Scott haven't eaten anything more than energy bars.
10:20 p.m., Lindsey's Family Restaurant
Everyone is starving. Playing baseball in the Cape League puts all the players on weird eating schedules, \
with noon lunches and 11 p.m. dinners more common than not.
So as soon as tables fill with Gatemen, the waitress comes over to take drink and soup orders. There's a buf-
fet with beef tenderloin tips, shrimp alfredo and corn in the next room.
The players attack the buffet, and they also notice the entire Y-D team eating in the next room over. Teams
will sometimes do this - host a dinner for an opponent, and then the other team will return the favor.
Ryan makes a beeline for Burgoon, the Michigan reliever, and they talk for a few minutes.
The players return to the table and inhale their meals. Some go up for seconds, and others wait to pounce on f.
the dessert trays of cookies and brownies.
By 11 p.m., everyone's pretty much full and all the conversations are pretty much exhausted. A couple of the
guys talk about heading to some local girl's house to hangout, but most of the players, like Ryan, are tired from
the long, hot day. Ryan and Scott just plan on heading home to their air mattress and futon, which suddenly
seem more appealing after the long day.
September 7,2009:12:00 p.m., Bruegger's
ANN ARBOR - More than a month later and 789 miles from the Cape, Ryan sits at a table in the local
coffee shop, eating a breakfast sandwich a day before classes start.
Looking back, it's kind of funny that July 28,a typical day on the Cape for Ryan, was anythingbut typical
on the field.
Ryan went O-for-3, and Wareham lost that day.
But over the course of the season, Ryan stood out offensively, compiling a .236 batting average - 25
* points above the team average - with 14 RBI and eight extra-base hits. The Gatemen were a playoff-caliber
team, finishing with a 19-19-6 record.
But the rest of the tale is pretty accurate, and the daily grind was Ryan's favorite part of the experience.
"Grind" is definitely the best word to describe it - practice, practice, practice, game. Ryan played through
bruised kidneys, general soreness and the classic New England fog.
It's a different experience from the college season, where players have multiple-day breaks in between THE
games and see the opponent's top pitchers on Friday nights only.
Adjusting to a new coaching style, complete with lots of hitting advice and technique analysis, can also . C O U R T YA R D S
be confusing.
And most of all, the sky-high level of competition guarantees that not everyone finds success - and $ DT A E N TS
there's value in that. I
"I think I learned to fail out there," Ryan said. "I knew if I struck out the first two times, I'd still get
another two at-bats.... That's going to help me in the long run. It wasn't like I had a job on the line or any- / 3 4
thing. In pro ball, if you get frustrated, you might lose your job."
After all, baseball is the sport where failing two out of every three times at the plate means success. And 1
on the Cape, Ryan learned that it's worth it to move across the country, live out of a suitcase and spend nine +
hours a day at the field to have that chance.

Mike Hulslander, a friend of
Merritt since high school, thought
highly of IMU's different ideas.
"I think it's very unique the social
aspect that he's bringing in and de-
veloping with it' Hulslander said.
"It's much cooler to have an idea to
develop a socially aware platform,
which I think is different compared
to anyone else doing this sort of
thing."
And another supporter of IMU
is Michigan basketball coach John
Beilein.
Beilein appeared briefly in a
promotional video Merritt shot to
showcase his company and the T-
shirts it sells. Merritt said that he
just had to go into his coach's office
and explain what he was trying to
do, and Beilein "loved it' Beilein
was also impressed by what he saw
Saturday night.
"(Merritt) is almost unflappable
when it comes to these types of
situations," Beilein said. "He's got
a lot of confidence in himself. And
anyone who is his age taking over a
company, you've got to have a lot of
confidence and he does'
Merritt played in all 35 of the
Michigan's games last season and
started in i4 of the contests. He av-
eraged a modest .e points and one
assist per game, but he had a much
larger impact than the stat sheet
indicates. He led the team with
speeches before games last season,
and Beilein said that the leadership
he showed as a captain last season
would certainly help with his busi-
ness.
Merritt also said he gained a lot
from his basketball-playing days in
learning how to work hard and per-
severe. He graduated with a degree
in Sport Management in 2008, but
the life skills he learned as a leader
on the court could prove to be a dif-
ference maker.
"As a captain last year for the
team, (I) really learned the impor-
tance of selflessness," Merritt said.
"The importance of giving yourself
to a greater goal, to sacrifice your-
self for the good of others. Through
that experience we have IMU, and
it's kind of the same mission - sac-
rificing yourself for bettering com-
munities."
Merritt admitted that he has an
idea about the future of IMU, but he
wants the company to listen to its
customers and let the future of IMU
be wherever the customers want it
to go.
"Ann Arbor is the perfect place
for us to start,' Merritt said. "We
never thought of opening anywhere
else. Just the perfect community.
A community that's really open to
new ideas, a very loyal community."

an intricate part of their culture or

Winfield said, but specific reper-
cussions for disobeying the policy
are being discussed. There will also
be changes made to the Statement
of the Student Rights and Responsi-

policy, he said.
Winfield said he expects there
will be some dissent regarding
the policy, but that in two years
time, most of the dialogue will be

"I think most smokers under-
stand that over the years their
behavior is not conducive to non-

smokers have come to grips with

this to some degree," he said.
Similar policies have already
been implemented on more than
260 college campuses across the
country, including the Univer-
sity of California at San Francisco,
Indiana University and the Univer-
sity of Iowa, according to the press
release.
Karen Whitney, chair of the
Indiana University Purdue Univer-
sity Indianapolis Smoking Policy,
said the tobacco-free policy was
well received by members of the
university community when it was
implemented in August 2006.
Whitney, IUPUI's dean of stu-
dents, said the smoke-free policy's
compliance with the university's
mission as a health and life sciences
campus has allowed the university
to be highly successful in its imple-
mentation of the regulation.
"It has significantly reduced
smoking on university property,"
Whitney said. "It has changed and
reformed the campus. It is now
considered unacceptable to smoke
on campus."
Whitney said while the policy
has improved the air quality on
campus, there is no evidence that it
has reduced the cost of health care
for its faculty and staff.

JANUARY 15, 2009 - A
collaborative effort between
researchers at the University
of Texas Medical Branch and
the University of Michigan was
the first to successfully produce
functional artificial bone marrow,
paving the way for future research
on human reactions to new drugs.
The venture - a joint effort
between a University of Michigan
biomedical engineering professor
and two researchers from the
University of Texas Medical
Branch - took seven years to
complete and was funded by
Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency.
The project is currently being
used asa model to test the human
immune system's response to
new drugs.
Joan Nichols, one of the UTMB
researchers, said the artificial
bone marrow system is a step
forward for drug testing because
it provides a far more accurate
response than tests on bone
marrow from mice or rats. She
added that further possibilities
for potential uses of the artificial
bone marrow are endless.
"It will help scientists that
designvaccines totreatinfections
or environmental exposure to
chemicals that cause leukemia
or other diseases," Nichols said.
"It could even be used to test the
immune response to cosmetics or
foods."
For the project, Kotov created a
matrix that mimics the tissues that
support bone marrow in a human
body. Using this matrix, artificially
produced bone marrow can live at
least sixmontis.
Nichols and Joaquin Cortiella,

the other UTMB researcher,
created the artificial bone marrow
to grow in Kotov's matrix.
Kotov said that additional uses
for the artificial bone marrow
include the possibility that it
could allow for new research
on chemotherapy drugs. Many
chemotherapy drugs limit bone
marrow function, leaving the
body vulnerable to infection.
The artificial bone marrow can
be used to test these drugs more
effectively, Kotov said.
"More thorough and less
expensive studies give a better
chance that some dangerous side
effects can be caught in time," he
said in an e-mail interview. "This
is much needed both for patients
and pharmaceutical companies."
Currently the artificial bone
marrow can't be transplanted
into humans, but with continued
research,bonemarrow transplants
may be within reach, Nichols said.
"In terms of use in people we
are a long way from clinical use,
because it takes a great deal of
money to test systems like this
before you move to human trials,"
she said.
Nichols added that the
accomplishment is an achievement
of teamwork and persistence.
"It took all of us together, and
we failed a lot in the first three to
four years of our work together,
but we always banded together
and tried again," she said.
Kotov said the development
is not only an achievement in
biomedical research, but it will
also help to revitalize the state's
economy.
"We are trying to re-energize
the biotechnology sector of
economy in Michigan and to bring
new ideas to the industry in the
difficult economic times," he said.

. Obama names former 'U' prof
as NIH director candidate

By KATHERINE MITCHELL
Daily StaffReporter
JULY 10, 2009 - President
Barack Obama announced the
nomination of Dr. Francis Collins
as his choice for director of the
National Institutes of Health on
Wednesday.
Collins, a former University
professor and researcher, had
been serving as director of the
Human Genome Project until
his resignation in 2008. He was a
University faculty member from
1984 to 2003 during which time
he researched and taught in the

Medical School.
Human Genetics Prof. Thomas
Gelehrter, who recruited Collins
to the University and co-taught a
medical genetics class with him
for many years, said he believes
that Collins is a remarkable
researcher.
"He is an outstanding scien-
tist," Gelehrter said. "Clearly he
is a star."
Collins's most noteworthy
accomplishments include the dis-
covery of the cystic fibrosis gene
while researching at the University
in 1989 and directing the comple-
tion of the Human Genome Project

in 2003. The project mapped and
identified all human genes, suc-
cessfully identifying the more than
20,000 genes in human DNA and
their multiple sequences.
The NIH - based in Bethesda,
Md. - controls billions of federal
grant money awarded to thousands
of scientists. The organization's
Web site states that the orga-
nization awards almost 50,000
competitive grants to more than
325,000 researchers. These grants
reach over 3,000 universities -
including the University of Michi-
gan - along with medical schools
and other research institutions in

the United States and abroad.
If officially appointed director
of the NIH, Collins would face
new challenges in light of the
economy and the new presidential
administration. Both Gelehrter
and Deb Gumucio, one of Collins
first post-doctoral researchers
in Collins' lab at the University,
recognize how Collins's natural
abilities will aid him in shaping
the future of the NIH.

and developmental biology in the
Medical School, said Collins has

Making campus buildings 'green'

University facilities
teams-plan to tackle
about thirty builidng
each year
By ELAINE LAFAY
Daily StaffReporter
SEPTEMBER 4, 2008 - A new
campus-wide energyprojectseeks
to stem rising energy costs by
making buildings more efficient
and educating building occupants
about ways to better conserve
energy.
Planet Blue, which was offi-
cially launched this fall, is head-
ed by the University's Facilities
and Operations department. It
includes three teams comprised of
engineers, mechanics, plumbers
and building managers.

Since the pilot program began
in October of last year, each Plan-
et Blue team has aimed to upgrade
ten University buildings per fiscal
year. The goal of the program is to
decrease the $111 million the Uni-
versity spent on utilities in the fis-
cal year 2007 by about,10 percent.
A major aspect of Planet Blue
involves upgrading a building's
facilities such as fitting it with
dual-flush toilets or faucets with
lighter water flow. Teams also
plan to install motion sensors to
decrease lighting costs and reduce
the amount of time fans run.
But before making these
upgrades, Planet Blue's leaders
first choose which buildings to
renovate - a decision based on
which buildings are the most
expensive to run and are the least
energy efficient.
The decision to upgrade abuild-

ing is also based on whether the
benefits of the new improvements
will outweigh their costs over a
span of eight years.
The Chemistry Building, for
example, cost the University $4.1
million dollars in the fiscal year
2008 - one of the most expensive
on campus. It was one of the first
buildings selected for upgrades.
The changes to the Chemistry
Building included fitting some
teaching labs with occupancy
sensors for fume hoods - a proj-
ect estimated to save $200,000 a
year.
Planet Blue teams also reduced
fan usage in the Institute for Social
Research building on Thomp-
son Street. That project will save
$80,000 a year. The relocation of
computer servers in the Fleming
Building is expected to save about
$97,000 a year.

Only buildings financially sup-
ported by the University's general
fund are eligible for upgrades by
Planet Blue. Athletics facilities,
University Hospital facilities and
University-owned housing don't
receive general fund money and
must pay for their own renova-
tions.
But Planet Blue's project man-
ager Kris Kolevar, said he was
confident these departments will
ask for consultations. Athletic
Director Bill Martin has already
asked Planet Blue to renovate
some sports facilities.
An education campaign about
reducingpersonal energy-use hab-
its was added to Planet Blue after a
University study found most peo-
ple on campus were unaware of
efforts to make University build-
ings more energy efficient.

Dance Marathon helps children,.
families have. fun or a good cause

By VERONICA MENALDI
Daily StaffReporter
MARCH 19, 2009 - Almost 12
years ago, twins Miles and Evan
Peguese were born three months
early, weighing only 1 lb 12 oz and
1 lb 9 oz, respectively. Their moth-
er, Andrea Peguese, was told that
if her children were to survive
they would face a pretty difficult
life ahead.
Andrea said she "never lost
faith and just knew that they were
going to make it." And that is what
they did: her "miracle babies" sur-
vived. In the summer of 2003, her
five-year-old twins were selected
as Michigan ambassadors to rep-
resent the state for the Children's
Miracle Network, an organization
that raises money for children's
hospitals.
But Peguese said that her kids,
who were diagnosed with cere-
bral palsy, would have never got-
ten this opportunity without the
help of the University of Michigan
Dance Marathon organization.
"It's really because of the Dance
Marathon that we really got intro-
duced to the Children's Miracle
Network and we've been a spokes-
person for CMN," Peguese said.
The University of Michigan

Dance Marathon is one of the larg-
est non-profit, student-run orga-
nizations in Michigan. It raises
awareness and funds for children
in need of pediatric care and assis-
tance.
This weekend, hundreds of stu-
dents will stand on their feet for
30 hours to raise money for fami-
lies like the Pegueses. The annual
marathon starts at 10 a.m. Satur-
day and will go until 4 p.m. Sun-
day.
The Peguese family has been a
fixture at the marathon for seven
years, but Andrea will never forget
the first time she attended.
"I lead with my heart, and
something in me just said do it, it
sounds like it'd be fun," she said.
"I didn't expect the emotion that
the students were going through.
It's huge that they were impacted
so deeply, their passion just really
burned through. And to stand on
your feet for 30 hours you have to
have a lot of passion."
Hilary Powsner, UMDM's
media relations coordinator, said
the dance marathon is a "tribute"
to the children they help.
"We are standing for those who
cannot stand," she said. "The out-
pouring of support that our orga-
nization both gives and receives

is, at least for me, the biggest rea-
son why I stay involved."
Peguese said that she not only
appreciates the students' passion,
but also their ability to show her
children a good time during the
marathon.
"I have found that the adults are
the ones that have problems deal-
ing with people with disabilities,"
she said. "And this (UMDM) was
an opportunity that allowed us to
interact with a great number of
people at one time. And they never
questioned what is their disabil-
ity or what's wrong with them. It
was just accepted and that breaks
down the barriers."
Powsner said that interacting
with the families is part of what
makes the marathon such a mean-
ingful experience.
"When you have a 10-year-old
kid who is just so excited to be a
part of this event, it is impossible
to put into words how right it
feels," she said.
The Ham-Kucharskis are
another family that students will
have a chance to interact with at
Dance Marathon. Dawn and her
husband Richard have one child, a
10-year-old son named Alex.
Alex suffered a stroke at birth
and has autism and cerebral palsy.

He has been involved with UMDM
for the past eight years and Dawn
said the organization has given
him the opportunity to become
more comfortable interacting
with others.
"Thanks to the social and rec-
reational opportunities offered
to Alex in his eight years of love
and acceptance with UMDM, he
now goes everywhere happily, and
loves malls, restaurants, parties,"
she said. "His old behaviors are
practically non-existent."
Dawn added that every time
they go to the marathon, it causes
"tears and laughter." She said she
has a lot of appreciation for the
students who participate.
"I can't even put into words
how much I love and admire these
students," she said. "When I was
a student, I never thought I could
give so much. I see that they see
school as a place where they can
not only get a degree but also make
an impact."
Peguese said she is excited for
the weekend because it provides
her family with a short escape
from reality.
"It's a relief. It's a safe weekend.
It's a safe interaction for all the
children and all the families," she
said.

Daily StaffReporter
JANUARY 19, 2009 - In the
keynote address of the 23rd Annual
Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
Symposium, NAACP Chairman
Julian Bond told the large crowd
assembled in Hill Auditorium
that while Obama's election is a
major victory for the Civil Rights
Movement, it is not the end.
"Weknowonemanclimbingtothe
top of the mountain does not mean
the end of the climb for everyone
else," he said to murmurs of approv-
al. "The NAACP is not the National
Association for the Advancement of
one Colored Person."
Throughout his speech, Bond,
a civil rights leader and founding
member of the Student Nonviolent
Coordinating Committee, empha-
sized the challenges that remain for
the African American community.
He pointed specifically to highrates
of poverty, incarceration and homi-
cide among African Americans.
Bond, a former Georgia Demo-
cratic state legislator, repeatedly
criticized the Republican Party for
ignoring issues that are important
to minorities.
"The Republican Party has
focused almost entirely on its
base and marginalized the rest of
the country," he said. "As long as
they do not look like or respond to
minority voters, the Republicans
will remain a minority party."
He was also vocal about the fight
for affirmative action.
"For mostofus the ideathatrace
should not be considered in reme-
dying racial injustice is ludicrous,"

he said. "There are no non-racial
remedies for remedying racial dis-
crimination.
Bond made particular reference
to the University, which was a focal
point in the debate over affirmative
action earlier this decade.
"This school - and not this
school alone, but particularly this.
school - stood up for justice and
equality when affirmative action
was challenged," he said.
Encouraging the audience to
continue working for social justice,
Bond said that King did not win
civil rights victories on his own.
"We must not forget that Dr.
King stood before, and with, thou-
sands," Bond said. "This movement
made Martin, Martin did not make
the movement."
Amie Snapke, an Ann Arbor ele-
mentary school teacher who was
at the event, said she plans to use
some of Bond's ideas to teach civil
rights history to her students. She
said students are more interested in
civil rights after Obama's election.
"The kids are super-excited. It's
greatto seethekids excited,"she said.
LSA senior Vanessa Andre said
she was glad Bond pushed people
to keep fighting for civil rights.
"He was saying that we're not
done yet," she said. "I think that's
probably the most important part
of the whole speech, and we've got
to keep saying that."
Bond ended his speech by echo-
ing Obama's campaign slogan.
"Now we know we can, if only
we will."

Renovations revitalize dorm life UMMA: Art gets a


Dining center's
completion marks
end of two-year,
$65-million project
ByJILLIAN BERMAN
Daily StaffReporter
SEPTEMBER 1, 2008 - The days
of bland casseroles are slowly
coming to a close at the Universi-
ty's dining halls, starting with the
new Hill Dining Center, which
opened last week.
The dining center, the cen-
terpiece of the newly renovated
Mosher-Jordan Residence Hall,
offers students "marketplace-
style" dining, with stations serv-
ing stone-oven pizza, grilled
sandwiches and rotating interna-
tional dishes.
LSA freshman Michael Bull
said he likes the Hill Dining Cen-
ter so much that he regularly eats
there instead of at Markley Hall,
where he lives.
"This is amazing compared to
the Markley cafeteria," he said.
"The Markley cafeteria is nothing
compared to this."
The two-year, $65-million
renovation to Mosher-Jordan is
the first large-scale project com-

pleted under the Residential Life
Initiatives program, an effort to
reorganize and renovate campus
dining and also modernize resi-
dence halls.
Housing officials have said
they plan to move toward a sys-
tem with fewer cafeterias, in part
to curtail rising costs, while serv-
ing more students and offering
more food choices at each dining
center.
Three years ago, campus's Hill
neighborhood had five cafeterias:
at Markley, Couzens, Alice Lloyd,
Mosher-Jordan, and Stockwell
halls. When renovations end on
Stockwell next year, the Hill Din-
ing Center, overlooking Palmer
Field, will serve a total of four
residence halls.
The next "marketplace" din-
ing center is slated to open in fall
2010 at the new North Quad Resi-
dence Hall, under construction
on the corner of State and Huron
streets.
Mosher-Jordan Hall, built
in 1930, also received a modern
facelift, but University Hous-
ing spokesman Peter Logan said
many of the residence hall's new
features - new electrical wiring,
plumbing and heating - aren't vis-
ible improvements.

major upgrade

By BEN VANWAGONER
Daily FineArts Editor
MARCH 23, 2009 - After
two-and-a-half years and $41.9
million worth of renovation and
expansion, University students
will finally get a glimpse of the
University of Michigan Museum
of Art's long-awaited makeover
tonight.
The length of construction
means that for many students on
campus, this evening's preview
will be their first chance to
experience the museum, which
houses more than 18,000 works of
art and is now more than double
its previous size.
During a walkthrough of
the museum yesterday, UMMA
Director James Steward's rueful
grimace made it clear that he
realized this all too well.
"How many of you were in the
museum before (the expansion)?"
he asked Daily staff on a tour
yesterday. "Probably not many."
TheMuseum'sdoorswillbeopen

tonight from 8 p.m. until midnight.
Planned exclusively with students
in mind, the preview features two
DJs and Ann Arbor band The Great
Divide, who will perform amid
the oil paintings and sculpture of
the European and American art
gallery.
Most events will be occurring in
the Apse - a wide-open, columned
space in the middle of the old wing
- but every gallery in the newly
expanded museum is open for
exploration.
Steward emphasized that
connecting with students is one
of the Museum's major goals, and
many of the features of the new
section - officially the Frankel
Wing - are designed to enable
that.
The purpose of the expansion is
tocreatewhatStewardcalls a"town
square for the arts" by bringing
students, faculty and community
into direct, unmediated contact
with artand witheach other.
"We want it to be like the Diag,"
Steward said.

* When the University
almost hosted the Olympics

JANUARY 14, 2009 - Univer-
sity athletes have always had a
prominent place in the Olympic
Games. From track and field to
the most prominent face of the
2008 games, Michael Phelps,
athletes have represented the
Maize and Blue well in interna-
tional competition. But what if
instead of just competing in the
games, the University hosted
them?
In 1958 the University almost
0 got that chance.
That year the United States,
along with three other coun-
tries - Japan, Austria, and Bel-
gium - was being considered to
host the games in 1964.
Many believed that the Unit-
ed States would be selected, and
if chosen, Detroit would have
been the front-runner to host
the games. The other possible
cities were Chicago, Philadel-
phia and Los Angeles - which
hosted the Games in 1932.
If Detroit had been selected
as the hosting city, former Uni-
versity Athletic Director H. O.
"Fritz" Crisler said he would
have allowed the use of Michi-
gan Stadium, Ferry Field and
Yost Field House for the track
and field games.

Crisler added that he
would've also allowed theuse of
University Housing facilities.
Greg Kinney, associate archi-
vist at the Bentley Historical
Library, said that the Michigan
Stadium was listed to potential-
ly host soccer matches, and the
University could have also been
used for swimming and diving.
Although Michigan never got
the chance to host the Olympics,
the state had a few proposed
plans just in case.
Former State Sen. John
Swainson (D-Detroit) pro-
posed a plan to build a 100,000-
seat stadium at the Michigan
State Fairgrounds in Detroit to
accommodate the Olympics.
In addition, new hotels were
scheduled to be built in Detroit
prior to 1964 to house specta-
tors.
But it was not to be. On May
26, 1959, Tokyo, Japan won the
right to host the Olympics with
34 bidding votes by the Inter-
national Olympic Voting Com-
mittee. Detroit came in second
place with 10 bidding votes.
Vienna, Austria and Brussels,
Belgium followed with 9 and 5
biddingvotes, respectively.

NOVEMBER 10, 2008 -The University has had a slew of famous alumni - the man who voiced Darth Vader and
Mufasa from "The Lion King," a modern-day Charlie's Angel, a president, a famed playwright, several notorious
murders. Traces of these four illustrious alumni still survive on campus today, but rather than namesake libraries or
theatres, it's the smaller artifacts that reveal what these alumni were like in their formative days at the University.

* When dorms were absent
from campus life

SEPTEMBER 1, 2008 - The
anxieties of arriving on campus
for the first time can be intimi-
dating for most freshmen, but
before the 1930s, University stu-
dents had to find a place to sleep
before they could make new
friends.
Modeling German campuses,
the first University president,
Henry Tappan, reasoned that
student housing wasn't neces-
sary in an effort to save space for
additional classrooms, so stu-
dents were forced to find room-
ing houses or take up residence
in a fraternity or sorority on
campus.
By the mid-1920s, there were
only 325 women and no men
living in select University dor-
mitories, including the Martha
Cook Building, Betsy Barbour
House and Couzens Hall. At the
same time, about 3,000 men and
women lived in Greek housing.
An additional 4,500 men took
up residence in rooming houses,
and another 800 women lived in
approved league houses.
Soon, then-new University

President Clarence Little and
Sociology Prof. Robert Angell
became concerned about the dis-
tractingelements of the fraterni-
ties and rooming houses.
Little decided to introduce
dormitories as a way to ensure
thatintellectual and social needs
were being properly met, with
professors "living in" to look
after student activities.
Buttheplanforresidencehalls
had a few setbacks. Landlords
lashed out, fearingacatastrophic
loss of tenants, and Little had to
tread lightly, knowing that pow-
erful alumni were loyal Greek
community members.
Eventually, after a decision by
the Board of Regents and finan-
cial help from alumni, construc-
tion of Michigan's first large
dormitory began. In 1930, the
University opened the doors of
the Mosher-Jordan Residence
Hall.
Later, after the Great
Depression ended, a series of
additional residence halls were
constructed.
- HAVANBASSETT

Of all the people featured,
former President Gerald Ford
has undoubtedly left the biggest
mark on the University. The
man has a library and an entire
school named after him.
A more personal legacy,
though can be found at the
fraternity Delta Kappa Epsilon.
When Ford wasn't studying
for a dual-degree in political
science and economics or
playing center and linebacker
for the Wolverines, he could be
found at the DKE house at 1912
Geddes.
While he was an active
member in DKE, Ford covered
part of the cost of school by
washing dishes at the fraternity
house in exchange for room and
board.
Ford's involvement with DKE
didn't end when he graduated.
In a place called "The Shant"
at 611 /2 East Williams Street,
DKE has accumulated a large
cache of Ford related fraternity
memorabilia. Inside the
display, are pictures of Ford
outside the fraternity house, a
wood carving he and his pledge
brothers made, and letters of
support and encouragement to
a number of pledge classes.,
In a letter to the DKE
pledge class of Fall 1987: "It
is no coincidence that three
Presidents of the United States
have been Dekes and that
our flag was flown with the
Stars and Stripes on the first
expedition to the North Pole
and the first manned landing
on the moon. The individual
qualities that DKE seeks have
certainly withstood the test of
time and served us all in good
stead."

The author of "The Crucible"
and "Death of a Salesman" was
first recognized at the University
with the Hopwood Awards he won
for the plays "No Villain" in 1936
and "Honors at Dawn" in 1937.
Before Arthur Miller was on his
way to becoming the preeminent
American playwright, though, he
was interested in pursuing a career
in journalism. During his fresh-
man and sophomore year, Miller
was a reporter for The Michigan
Daily and eventually became a
night editor in his junior year.
While working for the Daily,
Miller developed his liberal politi-
cal ideology covering events like
the United Auto Workers' union-
ization efforts in Detroit and
Flint.
But Miller soon realized that
fact-based writing didn't really do
it for him.
"He said he stopped writing
for the Daily because he didn't
like sticking to the facts," English
and Theatre Prof. Enoch Brater
told the Daily after Miller died in
2005. "He much preferred making
things up. The rest, you know, is
history."
Late in college, Miller changed
his major from journalism to Eng-
lish and quit the Daily to write for
campus's satirical magazine The
Gargoyle, which provided Millera
more fiction-focused outlet for his
writing talents.
Excerpt from "You Simply Must
Go To College" in an 1938 issue of
The Gargoyle
Really, we collegepeople arethe
pick of the crop. Whatever these
reformers say about education
being all wet is just so much
melonwater and anybody will
agree. Education is fitting us
See MILLER, Page 8C

William Ayers - the man
who the McCain campaign
would have had sink Obama's
candidacy - garnered most his
anti-establishment fame from his
involvement with the militant
Weathermen in1968 and 1969.
Although his radical leftism
hadn't yet reached the point of
bombing public buildings, Ayers
was already getting in trouble
with the law as an undergrad at
the University.
In October 1965, Ayers and 38
others participated in a sit-in at
the Ann Arbor Draft Board. A
week later, they were found gauilty
of trespassing and eventually
sentenced to 15 days in jail.
Five days after Ayers was
released, he wrote a two-part
opinion article in The Michigan
Daily about his experience in
prison.
Among many revealing
anecdotes in the two-part series,
the most distressing is how
Ayers spent his birthday in jail.
On that day, he and seven other
cellmates were put into a tiny
room with "no toilet and absolute
minimum of ventilation" for two
days simply because one of Ayers'
cellmates tried to make a little hot
chocolate. - -
Excerpt from All-American jail,
part 1:
I don't mind terribly much that
I can't get books, because I don't
think I'll be able to do much reading
anyway. I thought that being
locked into a quiet, unstimulating
place would help me catch up
on some work: actually, reading
is very difficult and I've found
that this place is most conducive
to sitting on the steel bench and
dumbly contemplating the floor

Before hewenterazyand started

Kaczynski (a.k.a The Unabomber)
was one of the brightest
mathematicians at the University
of Michigan.
Before he wentcrazy and started
sending bombs to universities, Ted
Kaczynski (The Unabomber) was
one of the brightest mathematicians
at the University of Michigan.
Kaczynski came to Michigan
in 1962 to earn his masters,
and eventually his doctorate,
in mathematics. While here, he
received the University's Sumner
B. Myers Prize, which is awarded
to the best Ph.D. dissertation of
the year. The dissertation, titled
"Boundary Functions," is listed on
a plaque of Myers prize winners
in East Hall. The work Kaczynski
published while here was on the
cutting edge of mathematics for
the time.
"I would guess that maybe
10 or 12 people in the country
understood or appreciated it,"
Mathematics Prof. Maxwell O.
Reade, who was on Kaczynski's
dissertation committee, told The
New York Times in 1996.
The future Unabomber was also
worked here as a graduate student
instructor, and was evaluated by
his students as merely average, and
in one case,incompetent.Evidently,
he spent most of his time focused
on his own research, primarily
solving difficult math theorems.
The five years spent on campus
were miserable for Kaczynski, who
now resides in a super-maximum
security prison in Colorado.
"My memories of the University
of Michigan are NOT pleasant,"
Kaczynski wrote in a letter to a
Daily reporter in 2006.

RA N G S The key to interpreting college rankings is understanding the methodology
behind them. Which of these wildly differing systems are worthwhile?

By STEPHEN OSTROWSKI
Daily Staff Writer
The University of Michigan
calls itself home of the leaders
and best. And while the
catchphrase might smack of
arrogance, there is plenty of
support that this school does
lead the pack and is one of
the best - application rates,
research grants, alumni base
and college rankings.
The U.S. News and World
Report lists the University
as the 26th-best institution
of higher education in the
country, wedged comfortably
between the University of
California at Los Angeles and
the University of Southern
California, respectively.
Forbes Magazine,
meanwhile, listed the
University at 161st, right
between Lake Forest College
and Wisconsin Lutheran
College.
In the world of college
rankings, neck-breaking
double takes abound. But it's
the nature of the business that
discrepancies exist - why
would Forbes begin ranking
schools if its list was going
to match up almost exactly
with U.S. News, the leading
rankings publication? The
flip side to that, of course, is
how could a dozen different
publications differentiate

their rankingsystems enough
to make printing them
worthwhile? The trick is
widelyvaryingmethodologies
so that the same qualities
that got a university in one
publication's top 20 barely
warrant a ranking above 200
to another publication.
College rankings might
not be what they appear
to be, but they can't be
written off altogether. At
least prospective students
don't think so. According
to Michigan Cooperative
Institutional Research data,
41.6 percent of students
entering the University in Fall
2008 said that rankings were
"very important" in deciding
where to attend, compared
with only 3.4 percent ten
years ago. The same data has
the percentage of students
answering "very important"
at 33.5 percent five years ago.
The importance -
perceived importance, at
least - of college rankings is
as objective as the rankings
are subjective. To decide
which publications give the
University a fair shake and
which are just talking trash,
it's crucial to look at the
methodology of the ranking
system. Here is a breakdown
of four very different
approaches to ranking the
nation's colleges.

Undoubtedly the recognized authority on college rankings, the U.S. News
list can be likened to the hyper-masculine, turbo-Neanderthal fourth-grad-
er that dominates the blacktop and crushes the meekcompetition. But name
recognition does not necessarily translate into respect.
The Education Conservancy, an education reform organization, has an
open letter on its website signed by several university presidents that criti-
cizes the U.S. News rankings as "misleading" and says that its system tends
to "overlook the importance of a student in making education happen and
overweight the importance of a university's prestige in that process."
As detailed on its website (college.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com),
U.S. news obtains its rankings by averaging together differently weighted
components. First is peer assessment, weighed at 25 percent, for which
university administrators rate schools' academic programs on a 1-5 scale.
Second is retention rate, weighed at 20 percent, which measures how many

Harvard is ranked 28th. Enough said?'
On its website, The Washington Monthly prefaces its rankings with
the following: "Welcome to The Washington Monthly College Rankings.
Unlike other college guides, such as the U.S. News and World Report, this
guide asks not what colleges can do for you, but what colleges are doing for
their country." Kennedy allusions aside, The Washington Monthly aims to
create rankings of colleges based on one question: "Are they doing well by
doing good?"
To actually measure universities' devotion to the adage "do goodby doing
good," The Washington Monthly determines its rankings by three compo-
nents. The first is a school's capability to perform as an "engine of social
mobility" based on the projected graduation rate of Pell students (grants
received by lower-income students).

Playing apparent foil to the U.S. News is Forbes Magazine, whose rank-
ings are based on "the quality of education (universities) provide and how
much their students achieve."
Rankings are determined in conjunction with the Center for College
Affordability and Productivity and include five components. First, weighed
at 25 percent, is the number of alumni in the yearly "Marquis Who's Who in
America" list, a directory of influential people in the nation. A description
of the rankings system's methodology onForbes.com said this measurement
was selected over the peer assessment method used by U.S. News and stu-
dent opinion prioritized heavily in Princeton Review. The Forbes list focus-
es on alumni achievement more directly than any other rankings.
Accounting for another 25 percent is student evaluation of professors,

Perhaps the most novel rankings system belongs to the Global Language
Monitor, a linguistics organization ranking schools based on, according to
languagemonitor.com, a school's "appearance on the Internet, throughout
the blogosphere, aswell as global print and electronic media."
This system seeks to measure prominence of a school's "brand name" by
counting how many times its name is mentioned online as well as in print
and electronic media. GLM attains this information with its "Trendtopper
analysis" system, which the company has used to track trends in word usage
over the last five years.
GLM President Paul J.J. Payack said on the website that the students who
go farthest are those who carry the best name recognition.
"Prospective students, alumni, employers, and the world at large believe
that students who are graduated from such institutions will carry on the

What it means
to go Greek

Find your niche with'U' clubs

By ANNE THOMAS
Daily StaffReporter
Going Greek - What exactly
does that mean? Meeting for
an omelette and hashbrowns at
Mr. Greek's State Street? Maybe
around 1 pm on a Sunday. A new
immersive study abroad program?
Eh, I don't think so. But, as hot
Indian summer afternoon turns
into crisp earlyfall evening, going
Greek means choosing more than
omelet ingredients.
Commonly the term going
Greek is used to describe a choice
made by freshmen each school
year at Universities across the
country. At larger schools like
the University of Michigan, it
is often a popular way to find a
smaller niche in a seemingly end-
less expanse of students and their
groups. Additionally, joining a
sorority or fraternity definitely
relieves the pressure of finding
housing for sophomore year.
There are a few different paths
to becoming a member of the Uni-
versity's Greek system. While the
"traditional" ways consist of join-
ing one of the sixteen sororities
of the Pan-Hellenic association
or the thirty fraternities of the
Interfraternity Council, potential
members also have the option of
joining co-ed fraternities tailored
to specific interests like business
or law. There are also the Multi-
cultural fraternities and sorori-

ties, which allow students to join
based on different ethnicites.
Some like to mark Interfrater-
nity fraternities and Pan-Hellenic
sororities as excessive drinkers,
the bastions of party animals and
the terrorizers of an otherwise
quiet campus life. But in all seri-
ousness, many might argue that
Welcome Week wouldn't exist
without a blowout PIKE party and
those football Saturdays wouldn't
be as much fun without making
stops at various fraternity out-
posts with the ritual trek down
State Street.
Rushing a sorority can be
overwhelming. Women who
are already members spend
countless hours preparing for
rush. While many houses have
impressive decorations and great
snacks, rushees are reminded to
remember where they feel most
comfortable and to see through
the virtual blockade of stream-
ers and curled ribbon. Addition-
ally, houses come with their own
stereotypes. While some girls do
fit roles espoused by Greeks and
non-Greeks alike it is important
to assess each house in its own
right. But some do get caught up
in the hype, hoping to be associ-
ated with the best label they can.
These groups sure know how to
throw down for a party, and join-
ing a group gives a new freshman
an immediate network of friends
from across the country.

Contrary to what you may have
been told, you won't always be
burning the midnight oil at the
closest library multiple nights in
a row. Chances are, you'll find
yourself with a bit of free time
on your hands and no idea what
to do with it. The University
offers plenty of options for you to
choose from that will provide you
with the needed distraction from
your quality library time.
Given that the University is
so large, you are bound to find
at least a few people that share a
common interest or hobby with

you. No matter how abstract or
unique your interest is, at the
University those hobbies have
been turned into clubs and groups
that easily can be joined.
For instance, if you find
squirrels, especially the fuzzy
and chubby Ann Arbor ones, to be
incredibly cute and entertaining,
there's a group you could join
for that. Or perhaps fitness is
more of an interest to you -
there are running clubs, rock
climbing groups and martial arts
organizations. Then again, maybe
dancing is more of your thing;
there are groups that range from
ballroom dancing to Latin to even
classical dance. Even if you are

more interested in professional or
academic hobbies, such as foreign
language speaking, writing
for a journal or newspaper,
engineering, entrepreneurship or
even robotics, there are groups
for those as well. There are even
groups for political affiliations
andbeliefs.Allthese examples are
merely just scratching the surface
of the hundreds of organizations
the University offers, and if by
the off chance you don't find
what you're looking for, you can
always be the founder of a new
one. The point is, no matter what
it is you have a passion for, you'll
most likely find it here.
Though all the groups that

exist are very different in nature,
they all have one important thing
in common: once you become a
part of the group, the members
start to feel like family to you.
This can be especially great if
the University's size scares you
or you start feeling a little home-
sick. Being part of such a group
will allow you to have a small
community feel with people that
share the same interests that you
have.
Also, having them will help you
get through those nights when
you actually do need to stay in
the library until very late hours
studying for a midterm or writing
a paper you have yet to finish.

Relive the glory days with IM sports

0

By ALEX PROSPERI
Daily Sports Writer
Just when you thought your ath-
letic career was over, think again.
OK, so maybe you lost a step, can't
jump quite as high as you once
could and you're carrying around
a few extra pounds, but intramural
sports at The University of Michi-
gan offer everyone the chance to
stay competitive on the court, on
the field and even on the rink.
The U-M Department of Rec-
reational Sports offers nearly 30
different sports for Michigan stu-
dents, ranging from the popular
flag football and basketball, to the
more obscure innertube water
polo and broomball (hockey on
ice). With six different groups -
co-recreation, fraternity, gradu-
ate faculty staff, independent men,
independent women and residence
hall - IM sports offer every stu-
dent a chance to play sports in col-
lege.
The skilllevel, mental and physi-
cal preparation and stakes aren't as
high as you're used to, but IM can
be just as competitive. This is most
evident in the fraternity league,
where rivalries between houses

have been going on for years. Fin-
ishing atop the IM standings is a
huge goal for some houses, and
when Sigma Phi Epsilon (SigEp),
Pi Kappa Phi (Pi Kapps), Pi Kappa
Alpha (PIKE) or Phi Gamma Delta
(FIJI) meet up, you can expect the
same type of intensity from your
high school days. And in every
other league, expect to see plenty
of Division III-type athletes who
decided that a big school was their
better fit.
The one advantage to play-
ing IM sports instead of a varsity
sport is your interaction with the
referees. I know some of you read-
ing this don't care much for poor
officiating, but you had to bite your
tongue in high school. Well, wel-
come to college, where freedom of
speech is encouraged - just don't
cost your team sportsmanship
points.
Maybe - no - the best part of IM
sports has nothing to do with the
games or the competition. When
you come to Michigan, it's all about
the coveted championship t-shirts.
Each year, Rec Sports comes up
with a different style t-shirt, and

WHAT YOUR
FRATERNITY
SAYS ABOUT YOU
Here's your disclaimer - not everyone who belongsto the following
fraternities fits the stereotyp of the house. But generalizations exist for
a reason.
Sure, you're not technically supposed to go into rush with
preconceived notions of each house, but we're betting you'll realize
which houses are more academic, atheletic, or party-oriented within
your first week here.
We took many of the following descriptionsfrom Michigan's College
On The Record blog, written by a former student using a pseudonym.
Go ahead and laugh. It's all in good fun - and you'll understand soon
enough.

point & counterpoint on: GREEK LIFE

'The guys there enjoy wearing
sunglasses indoors, lifting
weights...sporting plaid shorts
and owning every color of polo
shirt imaginable."
"The biggest, richest, most
powerful house on campus.
And they don't even know.
(They're best known for) the
Mudbowl game they host
every year where they face
off against another frat which
literally has to limp on the field
to play them."
"When going to class, they wear
$6 stained white t-shirts and
sweat pants, but when going out
for the night, they wear $300
Armani hand woven button-
ups ... Their (baseball) hats are
always flat brimmed, tail, and so
precariously perched you swear
you could blow it off their heads
if you breathe too hard in their
direction."
"A siren song to many
freshmen early on in their
college careers, both male
and female ... If you get past
the sick house with a multi-
level dance floor full of hot
girls, you're left with a bunch
of ex-lacrosse players in pink
Abercrombie button-ups."
Known as "Shady Phi,"
it's probably the most
recognizable house on
campus - the white one with
the sand volleyball court.
The brothers there seem to
love standing on the balcony,
leaning over and shouting
to things to passersby as a
bunch of shirtless guys show
off their subpar volleyball
skills in the front "yard."

"I swear, every time I see a
Fiji in his little Fiji hat, there's
a 50 percent chance he's on
the Diag, collecting moeny
for cancer research at Mott
Children's Hospital. What the
hell can I make fun of there?"
They throw bottle caps
instead of ping-pong balls
into beer cups. They don't
believe in pledge terms.
Sig Ep is like that kid in
high school who everyone
made fun of for being weird
but who, in the end, was
somehow still kind of lovable.
Known for its constant,
disgusting displays of
debauchery, AEPi is pretty
much the Michgian version of
"Animal House." But when the
boys aren't partying, they're
studying - the house has
the highest GPA on campus.
Maybe alcohol doesn't kill that
man brain cells after all.
"My quick first impressions
of the house were just a few
B-school dorks I knew from
here and there and then
the various kind-of-alright-
but-slightly-awkward kids
in class."
'A majority of guys are rather
skuzzy and overall, quite,
let's say abrasive, but they've
never done anything to
warrant the 'bad boy' image
... they kind of just hang out
and play beer pong."

WHILE YOU CAN'T
control theyears afteryougraduate
from college and start living in the
realworld, you can controlthe next
four years with one decision -join
the Greek system.
Becoming a member of a
fraternity was the best decision I
made during my freshman year in
Ann Arbor. And to be honest, it's
not because of the crazy parties
fraternities throw (but those are
sweet, too).
The best part of Greek Life
is the relationships you develop
with the people in your house. It's
possible to make friends by going
to random parties, by meeting
people in your dorms and classes.
But there is no other organization
on campus that offers freshman
as many quality opportunities to
meet new people, develop fresh
relationships and become a partof
something that is bigger than the
individual like the Greek system.
There is an old saying: It's not
what you know, but who you know
in order to meet distinguished
alumni who are already making
huge strides outside of college and
who can help you in the future.
And by being a part of a group that
ranges from freshman to seniors
to alumni, you have a wide variety
of people to model yourself after,
as well as countless connections
to work with.
Moreover, you will become
lifelongfriends with people that are
knowledgeable and experienced
over such helpful things as campus

or sisterhood events, there is rarely

-ALEX PROSPERI The disproportionate
emphasis on drinking in many
fraternities is also a problem
the Interfraternity Council -
the umbrella organization that

oversees fraternity chapters at
the University - has mishandled.
You just have to have a few friends
involved in Greek Life to know
the many loopholes there are in
the council's drinking regulations
and how central drinking is to a
frat boy's life.
Have you ever been to a frat
party where someone draws
something on your hand, even if
you didn't bring your own beer?
That's just one example of the
party loopholes in council's rules:
Everyone is supposed to BYOB,
but instead the frat provides the
booze and just makes a mark on
your hand to correspond to what
you brought - err, didn't bring.
That's not to say that there
aren't a few good academic
fraternities around. This sector of
the Greek system focuses on the
academic aspect of college life.
Often these frats will focus on
one specific subject, such as math
or business. But these fraternities
also promote an unbalanced
approach to college life. All work
and no play makes, well, you
know.
The key to a successful and
enjoyable college experience is
moderation. Go out and be wild

Nations meeting on Wednesday;
be ready to do something more
than indulge yourself during your
college experience.
If you are looking for a lot
of drinking and nothing else,
you should head straight to the
nearest frat or sorority. If not,
steer clear of Greek Life.

SMOKE FREE
From Page 2C
But smoke-free policies are
not welcomed by all, including
George Koodray, New Jersey state
coordinator for The Smoker's Club
of the Citizens Freedom Alliance.
Koodray said banning smoking
on college campuses is part of a
growing trend to punish people for
non-obtrusive, legal behavior.
"We don't understand why in
America the law should penalize
people for a practice that's not
offensive to anyone," Koodray
said. "This kind of a ban on the
consumption of a legal product
doesn't have adverse affects on
anyone. We just can't understand
where this policy is coming from."
Koodray said everyone,
including nonsmokers should be
worried about the implementation
of this policy, as it could lead to
bans on other legal substances.
"A lot of people may not object
to this kind of policy because they
don't smoke," Koodray said. "But
downthe road, it's a slippery slope,
where we see this taking form to
other prohibitions in the future
that people don't approve of but
are completely legal."
Engineering freshman Chris
Pike, a smoker, said although he
thinks the University shouldn't be
able to conduct students' personal
behavior, it is still a good thing
they are trying to implement.
"I guess they can tell us what
to do; it's a public university,"
Pike said. "But we pay to go here.
They should be giving us some
freedoms."
GREEN
From Page 3C
"When people are more aware
of what the impact is that they can
have on carbon dioxide emissions
and costs, they are more willing to
participate in solutions," Kolevar
said. "We're really involving people
in the building because they know
how the building is used all day
long."
Richard Robben, director of
Plant Operations, said Planet Blue
used the results of the study to
shape other aspects of how the pilot
initiative reached out to University
employees, including making sure
they have support from high-level
administrators for Planet Blue
projects.
"We make a point of reaching
out the deans and chairman of
the department," he said. "The
study also encouraged the idea of
reinforcement, occupant education
on projects and telling people what
is in it for them."
Anuja Mudali, a Planet Blue
spokeswoman, said one of the goals
was to instill an energy efficient
mentality that would last long after
Planet Blue's three-year run.
"It's a matter of convenience for
most people," she said adding that
people will be more likely to recycle

if bins are located in the room they
happen to be in at the time.
Besides trying to persuade people
to make some of the more difficult
changes in lifestyles - like walking
downstairs to recycle paper -
Mudali said they would also strive
to make energy-efficient behaviors
more convenient.
But the outreach program does
not target undergraduates because
they're only on campus for four
years.
"Faculty and staff, graduate
students - they're static," Kolevar
said.

NIH CANDIDATE
From Page 3C
NIH, including the ability to
put the right people together to
solve a problem or work out and
issue. This is especially valuable
since he will be "taking the helm
(of the NIH) at a complicated
time," she said.
Gumucio said the last eight
years under the Bush adminis-
tration diminished the value of
science, meaning Collins will
need to lobby the Obama admin-
istration the need for science.
"Collins is a very motivation-
al person who will be able to ...
convey to (the new administra-
tion) how important science is,"
she said.
Gelehrter also praised Col-
lins's ability to motivate and
rally people together to solve
problems and accomplish goals
- a vital skill that will help Col-
lins encourage Capitol Hill and
other political powers to fight
for science's presence in the
political ring.
"He's a terrific cheerleader,"
Gelehrter said. "Now that's part
of his job."
Gelehrter said that he believes
these motivational and commu-
nicative skills will help Collins
lead NIH, especially because
of the success Collins found

in leading the Human Genome
Project. Gelehrter added that
one of the most "stunning"
accomplishments of his job as
project director was bringing
people together and fostering
international cooperation on a
big science project.
There are some criticisms that
can be made of Collins, though
Gumucio and Gelehrter aren't
concerned about them.
One issue, religion, has been
largely pushed aside by critics
due to Collins's support of some
stem cell research measures. A
self-proclaimed Christian, Col-
lins wrote a book in 2006, "The
Language of God: A Scientist
Presents Evidence for Belief,"
about the relationship between
God and science.
Though, some still take issue
with Collins's beliefs, Gumu-
cio said that, "in practice, he's
a scientist," and that his belief
structures did not interfere with
work in the lab.
Additionally, Gelehrter and
Gumucio recognized Collins'
background working with big
science, referring to projects
involvinglarger groups of people
working toward a big goal such
as the Human Genome proj-
ect. When allocating funding,
Collins will have to determine
how much goes to big science
versus little science, individual

labs doing projects and making
advances that aren't on such a
large scale but are still impor-
tant.
"I think he's already proven
he's very adept at working with
big science," Gumucio said, add-
ing that Collins must advocate
little science too.
Gelehrter said little science
has been enormously successful
in research as of late, and that all
the institutes that make up the
National Institutes of Health -
along with grant seekers - will
be vying for funding.
"Even though NIH has a lot
of money, there isn't enough to
support the good science that
could be done," Gelehrter said.
With the crumbling state
of the economy, science fund-
ing was improved through the
stimulus. As such, Gumucio said
there is some stability but that it
won't last.
The NIH received $8.2 billion
in stimulus money as part of the
American Recovery and Rein-
vestment Act signed by Obama
last February. The extra money
will only last about two years.
Gumucio said this is a ques-
tion Collins will have to address
early: "What is the model two
years from now when all the
stimulus money goes away?"
The NIH is the largest fed-
eral or non-federal fund source

for University research. Accord-
ing to the January 2009 Report
on Research and Scholarship
released by the Office of the Vice
President for Research, the NIH
granted $387,738,690 in fund-
ing for fiscal year 2007, totaling
41.7 percent of research funds.
In fiscal year 2008, NIH fund-
ing increased to $393,033,824
or 44.9 percent of all research
funding.
The report also recognized
the impact of the lack of sci-
ence funding in the last decade,
revealing that NIH expenditures
grew by 14.5 percent between fis-
cal years 1999 and 2000, though
the total "has been nearly flat"
since fiscal year 2006, increas-
ing by only 1.2 percent.
One of Collins's most recent
University honors came in 2007
when he received an honorary
degree as winter commencement
speaker. When asked this week
about why Collins was chosen
as the speaker, University Presi-
dent Mary Sue Coleman praised
Collins's scientific and personal
characteristics.
"Francis Collins is a world-
renowned scientist - the
description of him as a rock star
of science is pretty accurate
- who is a warm and funny
speaker," she said. "I thought he
was a wonderful and important
role model for students."

"I think two things students
will notice is that Mosher-
Jordan has central air-condi-
tioning throughout, and it has

he said.
Logan said removing the old

The residence hall also fea-
tures two new livingroomswith
full kitchens. The most notable
difference in Mosher-Jordan's
individual rooms is the modu-
lar furniture - an upgrade that
most other dorms have had for
years.
LSA sophomore Matt Hillyer
said the renovated Mosher-
Jordan has a "classier" feel
than Couzens, where he lives.
"Everything being updated, it
looked really nice," he said. "It

(which is what most people do).
I was a bit hesitant at first to
talk with the other prisoners
about why I was in, because I
expected that there would be
hostility towards an anti-war
or anti-draft position. But I
decided that it would be stupid
to keep saying that I was in for
trespassing (which is legally
correct), because that-kind of
becomes an admission that my
position is weak or that others
don't understand and feel
oppressed by the same things
I do.
When I started talking
about it I was amazed at how
many people were not only
open to talk about the war and
the draft, but seemed actually

pleased to be able to tell what
their experiences had been and
what they were going to do.
One young guy was particularly
articulate in telling about how
they'd been trying to draft him
and how he'd been dodging
it. He's planning to refuse
induction because he doesn't
like "what's going on over
there."
The only open hostility has
been from the police. One of
the turnkeys (jailers) has come
down to our cell a number of
times and, with a smile, has
sarcastically asked the other
people in the cell, "Well, you
learning anything from these
college boys?" A hillbilly kid
from Ypsilanti shut him up
yesterday when he replied,
"Yeah. Im learning how to

THE TRUTH ABOUT THE DORMS
Are you nervous about sharing a room with another person who you've never met? Do you know nothing about your assigned
dorm? We've solicited help from Daily writers who have lived in some of the residence halls on campus to provide you with
background information that the Orientation leaders and tour guides don't tell you.

CENTRAL CAMPUS: EAST QUAD
Entering East Quad through the courtyard, you immediately
sense something out of the ordinary. You can't place it at first, but
you know it has something to do with that girl wearing the kimono
in the corner, sketching mushrooms. And yes, the chanting coming
from that open window is part of it, too. Ignore the table of hipsters
staring you down, enter the building and smile. You have arrived at
the Bohemian cradle of the University: the Residential College.
To your left is one of two dining halls in which you will be served
more organic, vegetarian, international and locally grown food than
anywhere else on campus. Remember this acclaim when you grow
tired of barbeque tofu after your first month.
Upstairs, your room is bigger than any of your friends' in Markley,
but they still tell you East Quad sucks. And you either respond that
you love it or you say, "but the location is great..." There's no escaping
the community showers, but you don't mind. College is all about
experimentation anyway, right? Have fun with it!
Smell that smoky, herbal smell? That's the not-technically-
addictive-but-still-pretty-intense scent of nonconformity - your
gateway to the liberal arts. Breathe it in and you feel at home.
Oh, and if you're not a weirdo, there are plenty of normal people in
the South half of the building.
MATT GREEN
"CENTRAL CAMPUS: MARTHA COOK
Built in 1915 as a safe haven to house the women who would
eventually become the wives of the lawyers next door on South
University, Martha Cook currently houses approximately 140
female students who may or may not follow the archaic path of
past "Cookies."
While the students may catch a bad rep on campus for being
snooty and reserved, freshmen can be assured that their room
will be larger and nicer than in any other residence hall on
campus. Many will be pleasantly surprised by the number of
walk-in closets.
The environment is conducive to studying at almost any time,
and when weather permits, the porch that sits off the east side
of the building overlooking the fenced-in courtyard is perfect for
evening strolls and picnics. The weekly Friday Tea is something
that most, if not all residents come to love. And at the end of
the day, even though non-residents will need to be escorted off
the premises, the Cookies get to sleep soundly at one of the best
residence halls on campus.

At first, Couzens might not seem like the perfect dorm for
freshman year. Not only does it lack a dining hall, but-it's also a
slight walk from most classes on central campus. However, these
perceived shortcomings are easily overcome by Couzens' countless
positives.
It is great to have the beautiful Hill Dining Center within close
proximity, allowing students to grab a quick bite to eat with ease.
Both Palmer Field and the Central Campus Recreational Building
are only a short walk away, making it relatively easy to find a place
to enjoy some activity between classes.
It provides the ideal balance between social and studious
residence halls. The multiple lounges in Couzens facilitate
interaction between students, serving as comfy places to hang out
and relax with friends.
Additionally, the dorm is never too rowdy and presents a calm
working environment. When studying in a residence hall is just not
enough, the quick stroll to the Taubman Medical Library will surely
be appreciated, especially during the cold winter months.
Couzens offers the best of all worlds - a central location that is
neither too close nor too far from anything, a social environment
and a comfortable place for quiet relaxation and study.
SHRUTI UMESH GANDHI
So the rooms aren't so big, you're relegated to use community
bathrooms and the walk to class is a tad on the longer side, but don't
worry - two weeks into your first semester, all of your friends not
living in Markley are going to wish they did.
Markley is the end all, be all of residence halls at the University.
It has all of the essentials to offer you the best freshmen experience
possible.
So you have a paper and a final for tomorrow? There's a 24-hour
computingsite in the basement as well as a study lounge at the front of
the building to help in your academic endeavors. Do you get hungry at
10 p.m. but don't want to run outside in the 20-degree weather to grab
a late-night snack? Don't fret - the Hideway, a dining convenience
store, has everything you need to get you through your hunger pains.
Want to go out on a Saturday night? With over a thousand freshmen
and sophomores living in Markley, you'll always find people to hang
out with no matter what night of the week it is.
This is the dorm for incoming freshmen. Consider yourself very
lucky if you're assigned to live here.

HILL CAMPUS: ALICE LLOYD
The lingering sounds of students playing Beethoven and Billy Joel
on the piano float down the hallways. Students splatter paint on can-
vases in the art room. Others read and recite poetry in the lounge.
Welcome to the Lloyd Hall Scholars Program inAlice Lloyd.
Around 200 studentswith an interest in writing and the artsbelong
to the LHSP learning community.
Students in the program take English classes taught specifically by
LHSP professors and participate in arts and literary-oriented clubs
such as Photography Club, Extemporaneous Writing and Film Club
and produce A View from the Hill Literary Journal with writing and
artwork from students.
But Alice Lloyd isn't just a creativity oasis. About 200 residents
belong to the Health Science Scholars Program - another learning
community for students interested ina career in health.
HSSP students take health-related courses and attend monthly
seminars where healthcare professionals discuss the latest develop-
ments in public health.
If you happen to be one of the lucky freshmen placed in Alice Lloyd,
but not in either learning communities, rejoice. You get to live in one of
the dorms with the biggest rooms on campus, where Palmer Field is your
backyard and the walk to the dining hall is less than one minute away.
STEPHANIE STEINBERG
NORTH CAMPUS: BURSLEY/BAITS
You've heard the horror stories about North Campus and all its
doom. You've been educated on how living there isolates you from
the rest of the University. And yes, that is all kind of true.
But Bursley and Baits aren't as bad as everyone might have told
you. The commute to and from Central Campus does suck at 8
a.m., but you'll meet some really cool people on the Magic Bus.
With your newfound friends, you'll be able to bitch and complain
about how living on North is a pain but, in doing so, you'll develop
a bond with your fellow students. While North is three miles from
Central, the trek back to North at the end of the day will leave
you with a sense of peace that you have to really search for on
Central.
But if you're one of the unfortunate few assigned to live among
three miles from the heart of the University- I'm sorry. Find a
good group of friends, make the best of it and find a way to stay
at a friend's dorm on Friday night before home football games.
If you don't, you'll be sure to wait a while for the bus down to
Central.

With first director, Semester in Detroit
gears up for inaugural program

By BETH WITTENSTEIN
Daily StaffReporter
SEPTEMBER 3, 2009 - The
Semester in Detroit project, a pro-
gram which will intertwine a com-
munity-based internship and an
urban studies course, moved one
step closer to sending students to
the Motor City.
Craig Regester, the recently
appointed associate staff director
for the program, began work Tues-
day and is enthusiastic about the
program's goals.
"It will provide an opportunity
for students that seriously want
to immerse themselves in the city
in a way that wasn't possible until
now," said Regester.
Regester already set up a listing
of courses and additional infor-
mation about the program online.
Students will live in Wayne State

University residence halls and have
access to the school's facilities.
University professors and
administrators from several dif-
ferent schools and departments
have worked together over the
past year to launch the program
including Ginsberg Center Direc-
tor Margaret Dewar, Residential
College Director Charles Bright,
LSA Asst. Dean Evans Young and
Lester Monts, Senior Vice Provost
for Academic Affairs.
Regester said the group has
contacted more than 300 Detroit-
based organizations in hopes of
placing University students in
internship programs.
The program will offer three
elective courses for program par-
ticipants - "Detroit Connections,"
taught by Nick Tobier, an assistant
professor in the School of Art and
Design; a creative writing course

titled "Writing in Detroit" taught
by RC Lecturer Lolita Hernandez
and a Detroit history course taught
by Residential College Prof. Ste-
phen Ward. Ward and his students
will collaborate with Detroit's
Mosaic Youth Theater to produce
an oral history production at the
end of the term.
Regester said he plans to add
more elective choices for students
in the program.
He said he'd also like to see
the Semester in Detroit program
involve an extracurricular mentor-
ship program in which University
students can meet regularly with
a University alum living or work-
ing in the city and a Detroit high
school student.
"On a small scale," Regester said,
"that sort of mentorship program
will encourage more young people
to consider college in general."

A2 Film Festival: Projecting the future of film.

ByANDREW LAPIN
DailyFilm Editor
MARCH 19TH, 2009 -
"Welcome to the new world of
independent cinema," proclaims
the tagline for the 47th annual
Ann Arbor Film Festival (AAFF).
The choice of words seems odd,
because AAFF has been screening
the cutting edge of experimental
film since the festival's concep-
tion in 1963, smack in the middle
of pivotal decade for independent
films in America. The festival's
website bills the annual event as
"the longest-running film festi-
val of its kind in North America."
Maybe today's filmgoers are being
welcomed into this new world of
cinema, but the AAFF settled into
the frontier long ago.
Perhaps that's what makes this
year's theme, a journey into unex-
plained territories, so profound.
In 2006, a censorship controversy
over a handful of submissions

jeopardized the festival's state
funding until a successful joint
lawsuit filed by the AAFF and the
Michigan chapter of the American
Civil Liberties Union successfully
got the charges dismissed.
Now, with that storm fading in
the rearview mirror, it's time for
filmmakers and festival directors
to keep looking ahead to see what
cinematic ground has yet to be
covered.
"We're trying to make (our pro-
gram) as accessible as possible
without sacrificing the artistic
quality - without watering down
our programming whatsoever,"
said Donald Harrison, executive
director of AAFF, at a press pre-
view on March 3. He added that
the idea of this year's program is to
make audiences feel as if they are
visiting a brand new place.
There were a record 2,650 sub-
missions to the festival this year (a
25-percent increase from last year),
which were whittled down to the

125 films screening in competition.
Combined with the numerous out-
of-competitionscreenings andspe-
cial events scheduled to take place
between March 24 and 29, even
the most knowledgeable connois-
seurs of independent and experi-
mental cinema are guaranteed to
plunge into uncharted territories
when they take a look at the pro-
grams offered by the AAFF.
One of the most anticipated
events at the festival will be the
appearance of Oscar-nominated
animator Don Hertzfeldt, known
for shooting all of his films using
antique 35mm cameras, will pres-
ent the regional premiere of his
latest short film "I am so proud
of you." The film is a sequel to his
previous effort, "everything will
be ok," which won the Short Film-
making Award at the 2007 Sun-
dance Film Festival.
Several programs at this year's
AAFF will explore the history
and origins of experimental film,

highlighting the fact that even the
festival itself is on its own journey
forward. Two separate retrospec-
tives of the late visionary direc-
tor Bruce Conner ("A Movie") will
also be screened, presenting a rare
opportunity to view the filmmak-
er's work.
Harrison is especially excited
about the Conner retrospectives,
which he billed as a "must-see
attraction." He noted that Con-
ner's work is "for anyone who cares
about art, about important, intel-
lectual artists, not just in terms of
film, but in terms of the last 50, 60
years of art."
Even though the majority of
Conner's work was produced
between the 1960s and '70s, Har-
rison assured viewers that "his
retrospective is going to be ... as
cutting-edge today as these films
were when he made them."
Conner often employed stock
film footage as part of his work, and
the idea of remix culture is anoth-

er major theme being played out
at the festival. Mark Hosler of the
band Negativland, which gained
notoriety in the early '90s when
Island Records sued it for sam-
pling large portions of U2 songs in
its work, will be on hand to show
a multimedia presentation called
"Adventures in Illegal Art," which
is about the band itself. Hosler will
also co-host a panel discussion on
the Fair Use law titled "Remixing
the Rules: Copyright & Fair Use."
In a demonstration of the inter-
connectedness of the film com-
munity, experimental filmmaker
Craig Baldwin, who made a docu-
mentary about Negativland called
"Sonic Outlaws" in 1995, will also
be at the panel discussion. During
the festival, Baldwin will screen
and promote his latest film "Mock
Up on Mu," a conspiracy thriller
that also uses liberal amounts of
pre-existing film strips.
Further contributing to the
treatise on copyright laws will be

"RiP: A Remix Manifesto," which
is billed as the first "open source"
full-length documentary. "RiP"
follows the struggles of remix art-
ists who continually face uphill
battles when tryingto create origi-
nal work out of pre-existing mate-
rial, and it features well-known
mash-up DJ Girl Talk (Greg Gillis).
The filmmakers posted a rough
cut of the movie on their web-
site and asked visitors to create
their own edits for it. These edits
were then integrated into the film
itself, engaging the audience on an
entirely unique level that demon-
strates the idea of filmmaking as a
constantly evolving process.
"RiP" is one of the few feature-
length films that will be screening
in competition. The majority of
the other competing features are
short films that will be grouped
together into themed showcases,
including a "Terra Firma" pro-
gram highlighting films with

Art Fairs in Ann Arbor Lupe Fiasco fields Q&A

By BEN VANWAGONER
Daily Fine ArtsfEditor
JULY 13TH, 2008 -
This is not your grandmother's
art fair.
That's the message the Ann
Arbor Art Fairs want you to
believe, and truth be told, they're
right. The phrase
"art fair" may call Ann Arbor
to mind kitschy
wooden dolls or Art Fairs
intricately bent JuIy15-18,
wire sculptures 2009
- more an excuse Campuswide
to spend cash
on "summer
collectibles"than anythingelse. But
the Ann Arbor Art Fairs are more
than that. Perhaps, to differentiate,
we can take advantage of their
proper noun status and call them
just "the Fairs." They've earned it.

The Fairs are widely recognized
commercial exhibitions of some
of the finest art, both professional
and amateur, to be found in the
country. They will be filled to
overflowing with artists in every
medium imaginable: clay, jewelry,
printmaking, mixed media, wood,
glass, fibers, photography, drawing
and sculpture. Between the four
loosely collaborated fairs, there
will be more than 1,000 artists
sprawled practically everywhere
on campus. On Ingall's Mall, the
Ann Arbor Street Art Fair; on
State, East Liberty and Maynard,
the State Street Art Fair; on South
University, Ann Arbor's South
University Art Fair; and on State in
front of the Union, The Guild Ann
Arbor Summer Art Fair.
The artists themselves are only
the tip of the iceberg: The Fairs
are expected to draw upwards of

500,000 people over the course
of three days - that's more people,
three days ina row, than are in Ann
Arbor for football Saturdays. For
residents of Ann Arbor, it's a mixed
bag. It means great business, but
it also means unavoidable artistic
chaos for three long (long) days.
Streets so lately punctuated
almost solely by the treading of
the few remaining med school
and summer term students will
become on Wednesday the lively
playground of the imagination.
Our advice? Resist harboring the
cynicism of a local and let yourself
enjoy it. With staged music and
performances punctuating the
3-day fair in addition to the rich art
on display and sale, there should be
something of interest for just about
everyone. If all else fails, sell your
parking space and hunker down -
for these three days, art rules.

Rapper talks gay

Hillary Clinton on
steps of Grad
By KIMBERLY CHOU
Daily Arts Editor
JULY 29TH, 2007 -
Rapper Lupe Fiasco held court
on the Diag yesterday, answering
questions about politics, hip hop
and homophobia.
"I make really good hip-hop
music, Grammy-nominated hip-
hop music, GQ-Man-of-the-Year
hip-hop music," Fiasco said by way
of introduction. "The opportunity-
to-speak-to-y'all-in-the-Diag hip-
hop music."
Fiasco spit a few verses - old and
new material, with the crowd join-
ing in occasionally - but told the
400-or-so gathered that he wasn't
allowed to perform.
"I didn't know what to expect,"
said LSA sophomore Britney Rash-
leigh. "It's just good to see him, a
celebrity in Ann Arbor - an African-
American celebrity in Ann Arbor -
and for everyone tocome out."
At one point, a fan insisted on
freestyling for Fiasco. Fiasco let
the guy rap, though he joked, "You

tryingto take my shine, son." 4
But he then used him as an toc
example. He said he wanted to lis- cha
ten to the wannabe rapper, saying in t
that before current fame and for- ma;
tune, Fiasco was just like him. I
The event was sponsored by bau
Atlantic Records's Urban College groi
Network and the Michigan Chap- mo
ter of Hip Hop Congress. The hip- to p
hop star promoted his upcoming eve
album The Cool. dox
Fiasco, whose real name is
Wasalu Muhammad Jaco, took ball

about half an hour. The questions Sch

Lights. Camera. Economic stimulus?
Film students, consider staying put. In-state students, rejoice in something positive about Michigan's economy.
Enacted in April, the Michigan Motion Picture Incentive Program has filmmakers big and small shooting in Ann Arbor and other cities.

By COURTNEY RATKOWIAK
ManagingEditor
JANUARY 13TH, 2009 -
It is a nondescript office build-
ing, flanked by construction equip-
ment on a side street in downtown
Ann Arbor. The first floor directory
mainly lists doctor's offices, and
only after climbing a set of bland,
white stairs does it start to look like
you might be in the right place. The
second floor is just a long hallway,
with temporary, printer-paper signs
noting crew and director's offices
taped near the outside of each closed
door.
But the company that has taken
over the second floor of that build-
ing will be pumping millions of dol-
lars into the state and local economy
over the next few months. Its pay-
roll includes a two-time Academy
Award winner. And just one year
ago, it had no intention of bringing
its business to Michigan.
The movie "Betty Anne Waters,"
starring Hilary Swank, will start its
seven-week shoot in Ann Arbor on
Feb. 17, though its production crew
hasbeeninthe area since November
and will likely stay until the end of
April. The film is one of many that
have flooded into the area in recent
months, thanks tothe passage of the
Michigan Motion Picture Incentive
Program. And with much of Michi-
gan's economy continuing to crum-
ble, the face of the state's quickly
growing film industry may start to
look less like short-term, converted
offices and more like a Midwestern
Tinseltown.
BIG REBATE, BIG NAMES
The Michigan Motion Picture
Incentive Program took effect April
1 after passing unanimously in the
House of Representatives and 37-1
in the Senate. It states that a film
that spends at least $50,000 in the
state can receive up to a 40 percent
tax credit on Michigan cast, crew
and production expenditures (with
the exception of out-of-state crew
members) and an extra two percent
rebate if the film is set in one of 103
"core communities," including Ann
Arbor. The program is one of the
most aggressive in the country to
date.

With the auto industry flounder-
ing and an estimated $1.5 billion
budget deficit heading into the new
year, Michigan may not seem in the
position to offer up to a 42 percent
tax rebate to film companies that
won't be permanently funneling
revenue into the state. But propo-
nents of the program say it's a way
for Michigan to quickly diversify its
economy in a time when revitaliza-
tion is badly needed.
According to Jim Burnstein, vice-
chairman of the Michigan Film
Office Advisory Council, film rev-
enue was about $4 million in Michi-
gan the year before the incentive
was passed.
In just nine months after the ini-
tiative was enacted, the state earned
an estimated $100 million in pro-
duction revenue, Michigan Film
Office CEO Tony Wenson said.
"The film business is one that you
can see immediate results - and we
are," Burnstein said. "Since the law
was passed in April, it's the equiva-
lent from going from 0 to 100 miles
an hour."
After the initiative passed, Mich-
igan played host to movies ranging
from big-name blockbusters like
Clint Eastwood's "Gran Torino"
to indie films like "Cherry," filmed
on the Kalamazoo College cam-
pus. And the names of actors and
actresses who filmed in Michigan
read like a guest list at an A-list Hol-
lywood soiree.
Diane Lane. Drew Barrymore.
Christina Ricci. Adrien Brody. Kim
Cattrall. Sean Astin.
But Michigan isn't alone in luring
stars and film equipment away from
Los Angeles. Michigan's initiative
followed similar plans in states like
Louisiana and New Mexico, which
both have 25 percent tax credit pro-
grams and are considered to have
two of the country's most successful
fledgling film industries. Louisiana
served as the backdrop for 80 films
in 2008.
Before tax credit programs were
implemented, the high cost of film-
ing made it difficult for independent
producers to shoot in the United
States.
Producer Philippe Martinez said
he often filmed in Canada and East-

ern Europe because of the lower cost
of production. But Martinez set up
shop in Grand Rapids from August
to October to shoot the $4.8 million
thriller "The Steam Experiment," a
story about a scientist (Val Kilmer,
"Alexander") who takes six people
hostage in a steam room until the
local newspaper agrees to print his
global warming theory.
Now, with multiple states offering
tax rebates, there are more opportu-
nities to shoot in the United States
but the difference between states'
rebate percentages is minimal when
deciding on a location, Martinez
said.
"It's not like, 'How much would
I save compared to another state?'
" he said. "It's more like you don't
even come to the state, as an inde-
pendent producer, shooting some-
where where there's no tax breaks."
Even with bigger-budget and
less price-sensitive movies, choos-
ing a state in which to film requires
a mixture of what makes the most
economic and creative sense. Pro-
ducer David Permut had two films
slated for production in early 2008
- the $60 million film "Youth in
Revolt," starring Michael Cera
("Nick and Nora's Infinite Playlist"),
and "Prayers for Bobby," a Lifetime
movie starring Sigourney Weaver
("WALL-E"). Both films were set in
northern California, but Permut had
plans in early 2008 to shoot"Youth
in Revolt" in Oregon and "Prayers
for Bobby" in Alberta, Canada.
As soon as the Michigan film
incentive passed, though, Permut
moved both his films to Michigan
- and part of the "Youth in Revolt"
shoot to Ann Arbor.
ANN ARBOR'S LEADING ROLE
The potential future economic
impact of the "Betty Anne Waters"
crew in Ann Arbor was first seen
on a smaller scale July 28-31, when
"Youth in Revolt" was brought
downtown for four days of filming.
The entire film was shot in Michi-
gan, but mainly in the Royal Oak
and Traverse City areas. Based off
the C.D. Payne book of the same
name, "Youth in Revolt" chronicles
a sex-obsessed teenager's quest to
lose his virginity to a girl he meets
on vacation.

A scaled-down, special effects-
heavy crew set up at the corner of
Liberty Street and Ashley Street
to shoot the movie's third act. The
action sequence included a vin-
tage Lincoln careening down a hill
and crashing into the Obama cam-
paign's county headquarters, which
was converted into a hot dog stand
named Too Frank Sausages during
the shoot.
"Ann Arbor saved us on this film,
because quite honestly, one of our
biggest challenges was to find an
area geographically that we could
create that stunt," Permut said. "We
actually even talked about shooting
in a landfill at one point, trying to
basically build our own mountain,
which would have been really prob-
lematic. So believe me, Ann Arbor
became very meaningful for us."
Even in just a few days of shoot-
ing, Ann Arbor businesses benefit-
ed. Kay Seaser, account manager for
the Ann Arbor Tourist Bureau, said
Downtown Home and Garden sold
sun hats and patio umbrellas during
the shoot, and Sign-o-Rama printed
signs for parking and set operations.
Cast and crew frequented restau-
rants like Fleetwood Diner, Sweet-
water's and Conor O'Neill's.
"Typically, they would have
caterers on site," Seaser said. "But
the second unit location manager
who was here a month in advance,
she said, '(Ann Arbor has) such great
restaurants here - instead of bring-
ing catering to (the cast and crew)
every day, we're going to give them
a per diem and let them eat in the
local restaurants.'"
Fleetwood Diner owner Andy
Demiri estimated an increase in
sales of at least 25 percent while the
film crew worked around the corner
- a lot of take-out was ordered and
one night, Michael Ceraeven made a
midnight stop.
A construction crew came to
town to build the "Too Frank Sau
sages" fagade for the fiery crash
scene at least two weeks before the
actual shoot. Demiri said by the end
of the movie's time in Ann Arbor,
members of that crew were loyal
customers, eating at his diner once
or twice a day.

JDate profiles can lay the foun-
dation for musical collaborations
that extend far beyond the Diag.
Cut classes and weekends spent
in vans are common occurrences.
Practice spaces range from rooms
in the music school to cramped Ann ,
Arbor basements.
Sometimes, the bands don't have
any room to practice.
"When you're playing enough
showsstrungtogether,they become
your practice," explained My Dear
Disco's Tyler Duncan, one of the
band's two keyboardists.
My Dear Disco is merely one of
the many popular local bands for
University students. The band, cur-
rently made up of seven graduates
of the University's School of Music,
has gone through several lineup
changes over the years.
"The band was first called Tool-
box," Duncan recalled. "But our
first gig as My Dear Disco was at
the Blind Pig."
Ah, the Blind Pig. Planted snugly
above the 8 Ball Saloon on the cor-
ner of Washington and First Ave-
nue, the Pig is a modest venue, but
its importance to the local music of
Ann Arbor runs deep. Whether it's
housing a familiar crowd of locals
and students stopping by to see

out, there's still a seemingly endless
amount of drudgework to be done.
"It's a matter of constantly remind-
ing people that you exist," Vigger
continued. "Bands that ruthlessly
self-promote tend to do a lot better
much quicker."
"You really have to promote your-
self," said Ryan Sloan of Farewell
Republic, an inventive post-rock out-
fit that happens to be playing a show
tonight at the Blind Pig with Detroit's
Satin Peaches. "In Ann Arbor, you
learn how to build your chops as a
promotion machine."
In actuality, promoting shows
extends far beyond the thousands
of posters adorning Ann Arbor's
fagades: Tools like Facebook and
MySpace prove essential to reach-

ing larger crowds, and local press
is more than happy to put in a blurb
about an upcoming show every now
and then.
While most bands that call Ann
Arbor home would be considered
"indie," the term has become as
broad as, say, "alternative" was by
the end of the '90s. The broad spec-
trum of "indie rock" serves as an
umbrellaterm for the eclectic sounds
present across the Ann Arbor music
scene. Bands like Lightning Love are
notably peppier, with more dance
and pop-oriented sounds. At the
same time, there are plenty of other
more layered and guitar-driven acts
like Starling Electric and Farewell
Republic. Heck, My Dear Disco is
even known to break out the bag-

pipes in its live shows. Since there
are so many bands all with different
sounds, there has to be some compe-
tition, right?
"No, not at all," Sloan said.
"Everybody helps each other out,
and it makes for a really great atmo-
sphere."
The cooperative environment he
describes is apparent in the shared
bills at the Blind Pig, the constant
plugging of one another's shows and
somethingcalled Bluegrass Night.
"Bluegrass Night is a great time,"
said Duncan of My Dear Disco. Orga-
nized by local promoter Matthew
"Tuna" Altruda, Bluegrass Night is a
free night of roots music held every
Wednesday night at Circus Bar &
Grill above the Cavern nightclub.

It's more of a gathering of local
musicians than anything else, as
Duncan explains: "You go to Blue-
grass Night a few times, and I guar-
antee that you will eventually come
across everyone onthe local scene."
Local music shops thrive in
Ann Arbor, contrary to the decline
in larger music stores across the
country in recent years. Places like
Wazoo Records, Underground
Sounds, Encore Sounds and PJ's
Records have an important place
in the local music scene, promoting
Ann Arbor bands' upcoming shows
or new albums with large in-store
posters. Some show their support
by purchasing CDs from the bands,
regardless of their confidence in the

WORTH THE WAITa
After two years of renovations and new
construction, UMMA reopens - -


*I

By KIMBERLY CHOU
Daily Arts Writer
NOVEMBER 13TH, 2008 -
On the ground level of the Uni-
versity of Michigan Museum of
Art's new Frankel wing, two glass
walls join neatly, pushing toward
State Street like the prow of a ship.
Right now, the space they enclose
isn't much - something more to
walk around, though it affords a nice
view of the recently installed Mark
di Suvero sculpture "Orion."
"Most people are surprised to
find out that it's going to be a gal-
lery," said UMMA director James
Steward.
Once UMMA reopens during
winter term, after two years of reno-
vations and new construction, the
space will house temporary exhi-
bitions of emerging contemporary
artists.
"When we figured out how we
weregoingtositetheexpansion,this
is the space we first started thinking
of to help us capture interest of peo-
ple going past," Steward said.
Work exhibited inthisgallery will
employ light, movement and other
elements visible through the glass.
Hopefully, according to Steward,
being able to see such dynamicwork
without barriers - save for the glass
walls - will lure passerby inside.
"There's this idea: We want to
make art part of the everyday expe-
rience," he said.
The space is part of UMMA's
efforts to make the museum - and
by extension, art in general - more
accessible to everyone, every day,
in its position as both a University
resource and a community resource.
According to Steward, UMMA is the
largest museum between Detroit
and Chicago and people come from
great distances to visit. Each visi-
tor, whatever his or her walk of life,
should feel comfortable taking in a
performance at UMMA's new audi-
torium, viewing ceramics in what
will be the first gallery space dedi-
cated to Korean art at an American
university, or simply having a cup
of coffee while enjoying the view
from the new caf. The cafe and the
museum's extended-hour "walk-
through" space, which Steward is
suggesting as a campus shortcut, are
intended to draw otherwise unlikely
visitors.
The old building and new Frankel
wing will be multi-purpose. They
will be split into galleries, research

and conservation areas, educational
and social spaces, storage, retail and
a caf6.
"Weworkedveryhardtointegrate
functions in this building," Steward
said. "We want to persuade visitors,
when they come to the museum, to
visit the whole thing."
When the museum reopens after
its $41.9 million makeover, it will
be more than double the size of its
old building, the Alumni Memorial
Hall.
The University owns more than
18,000 art pieces, but was previous-
ly only able to show 3 percent of that
collection at a time. UMMA's off-
site location at the juncture of South
University and South Forest - what
used to be the original Mitch's Place
bar - allowed for even more limited
exhibitions. Now the added 53,000
square feet in the new building will
allow UMMA to show 10 percent of
its entire collection at a time. And
viewing and appreciating this art
need not be separate from learning
about it.
What UMMA calls its open stor-
age gallery is one way the museum
seeks to combine art appreciation
and education. The space that was
once the Chinese gallery (renamed
The Shirley Chang Gallery of Chi-
nese Art in the new museum space)
will now feature cabinets with
floor-to-ceiling glass shelving. The
construction of the gallery allows
for a dense arrangement of 600 to
800 pieces - such as Chinese pots,
American decorative arts objects,
African pieces - that scholars and
visitors can come in and study dur-
ing the museum's open hours with-
out an appointment.
"It's a way to create something
in between the pristine display of
art gallery spaces and dead storage
space, a way of animating the collec-
tion," Steward said. Call it experien-
tial storage.
Around the corner from the open
storage gallery is the old Japanese
gallery space, which will become
the Asian Art Conservation Labora-
tory's new location. UMMA's Asian
Art Conservation Lab has been
around for 25 years and is one of few
in the country. Today, the lab does
client work for other museums as
well. Here, visitors can watch con-
servationists at work, from behind
the glass doors.
"Sometimes, literally, it's like
watching paint dry, but the public
is really fascinated," Steward said.

"It's like alchemy; a magical mixture
of art and science coming together."
The conservation lab, open stor-
age gallery and temporary con-
temporary gallery all contribute to
UMMA's greater emphasis on "con-
nective tissues" - art spaces that
provide the link between different
cultures, between art and science,
and between education and appre-
ciation.

The building itself demonstrates
an architectural blend of old and
new. Alumni Memorial Hall, built
between 1907 and 1910, reflects the
Beaux-Arts revival style. While ren-
ovation of the old building stuck to
historic preservation, where work-
ers removed dropped ceilings and
additions added in earlier 20th-
century "attempts" at renovation,
the building didn't try to imitate the
past.
"We need to build a building that
was of our moment, historically,
not looking just to the past," Stew-
ard said. "Having said that, we also
sought to build (an addition) that
would keep company with the old,
in terms of scale and materials."
For most of the University's
undergraduate population, Alumni
Memorial Hall has always been
fenced in and under construction.
See UMMA, page 8D

New skylights in the original statuary of the Alumni Memorial Hall portion of UMMA combine natural light and electrical light to
best showcase the artworks.

GUILTY PLEASURES
T THINGS WE HATE TO LOVE .A

It's so much fun to enjoy things you know you
shouldn't. The art world is full of such guilty
pleasures. Like that DVD of "Purple Rain" you
throw on every now and then, or the stack of
"Weird Al" Yankovic CDs you listen to when no
one's around. Yup - we know about those.
And you know what? It's OK. We understand.
The things most easily enjoyed aren't always
the most respectable. Every once in a while you
" should just swallow your pride and admit it.
In honor of this sentiment, Daily Arts gives you
our own guiltiest pleasures, the stuff so few would
admit to liking. Maybe you shouldn't, either - you
have a reputation to worry about, after all.

DEATH CAB
FOR CUTIE
Ben Gibbard has all the
angst of a 12-year-old girl
with a snaggletooth whose
dog just died and her current
flavor-of-the-week boyfriend
just called things off. But he
does sing about his emotional
issues eloquently, and that's
only half of the enticing ele-
ments surrounding Death
Cab. Their talent for melody
and catchy "bah bahs" some-
how trump lines like "All I see
are dark gray clouds / In the
distance moving closer with
every hour" and "If there's no
one beside you / When your
soul embarks / Then I'll fol-
low you into the dark." Don't
feel bad if someone calls you
out on humming any lines -
just say those damn songs got
stuck in your head and put
your headphones on. Then
quietly enjoy the fluid angst.
MATT EMERY
BARENAKED LADIES
When it comes to juvenile band
names, "Barenaked Ladies" falls
right behind "Butthole Surfers" at
the top of the list. And while BNL's
embarrassing moniker may have
been the reason I became infatu-
ated with them during 5th grade,
somehow their lame, hyper-Cau-
casian adult contemporary has
kept me hanging on ever since.
(OK, even I fall off when they go
Canadian white-boy rap.) But it's
impossible to ignore the strength
in Steven Page's voice, and when
he pours it all into "Brian Wilson,"
"The Old Apartment" or, yes, even
"If I Had $1000000," the enjoy-
ment I receive is more than just the
feeling of nostalgia.
DAVID WA TNICK

"CHARLIE'S ANGELS
FULL THROTTLE"

Watching "Charlie's Angels:
Full Throttle" is like gorging on
candy when no one's watching.
What's the plot? Please, There
might not have even been a script.
All that has to be said is that it's
a nearly two-hour-long parade of
blindingly bright colors, beauti-
ful people in skimpy clothing and
over-the-top explosions. When
Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore
and Lucy Liu hop on stage mid-
movie for a ridiculously prolonged
striptease, it becomes clear the
filmmakers weren't going for
high art.
The film is a curiosity: It simul-
taneously demonstrates why Hol-
lywood should be chastised and
why it should be celebrated. In
other words, it's the definition
of a "guilty pleasure." Savor it -
behind closed doors.
BRANDON CONRADIS
"NAPOLEON DYNAMITE"
This earnestly goofy indie
comedy had the misfortune of
being an unexpected smash hit
upon its release, meaning that
soon everyone from frat boys
to your grandma was wearing
a "Vote for Pedro" T-shirt and
spouting bizarre catchphrases
like "Gosh!" Naturally, the next
step after "popular" is "overrat-
ed," followed closely by "sucks"
- whichis why I nowhave to feel
guilty for enjoying the movie.
But here's the truth: Napoleon
is a legitimately creative, origi-
nal character; the film's cinema-
tography perfectly conveys the
comic desolation of the barren
Idaho plains; and those dance
moves were awesome. Also, Rex
Kwan Do wins every time.
ANDREW LAPIN

"GOSSIP GIRL"
Sex, scandal and underage
debauchery - in prep school
outfits. What's not to love about
"Gossip Girl"? The CW-teen
drama follows the travails of two
oft-feudingUpper EastSide prep
school hotties, played by Blake
Lively and Leighton Meester.
The show has all the elements
of "OC"-inspired trash, includ-
ing murder mysteries, virginal
conquistadors, hormonal teen-
agers, characters who often fall
out of character and an "OMFG"
ad campaign that revels in the
show's bad press for its depic-
tions of underage sex and drug
use. Despite all this, the show
still gets anA+ forentertainment
value and is becoming one of
the most watched shows on the
Internet. It's safe to say that in
spite of its eccentric writing and
vulgarity, "Gossip Girl" will con-
tinue entertaining for a while.
SASHA RESENDE
"DEGRASSI"
You all have a friend who bitches
your ear off about his or her life
problems. And even though you're
sometimes irked by his or her vexa-
tions, part of you enjoys the vicari-
ous thrill of witnessing someone
else's misery. Germans call this
Schadenfreude. Canadians call
it "Degrassi." Imagine 25 friends
like that one, all with emotional
issues - from self-injury to bulinlia
to alcoholism and back again - all
revolving in a fucked-up carousel,
each coming back at just the right
moment with a new hang-up or
foible. You can either disembark
to puke or stay on for the ride.
I've stayed on - for five years and
counting.
MA RK SCHULTZ

"SO YOU THINK
YOU CAN DANCE"
Once you get past the melo-
drama and glitter, "So You Think
You Can Dance" is one of the most
genuinely entertaining and inspi-
rational reality competitions I've
ever seen, and I've seen a lot. The
contestants are extremely tal-
ented and have struggled to make
a career in the fickle industry of
professional dance. They perform
every style, from Krump to Vien-
nese Waltz, often outside their
comfort zones. That's what the
show's all about: Bringing the
vibrant, diverse world of dance
to the masses. Sure, the show
sometimes suffers from "Ameri-
can Idol" cheesiness, but all the
sequins, gimmicks and product
placement are greatly outweighed
by the deeply emotional and tech-
nically proficient dancing it dis-
plays.
JAMIE BLOCK
"OCEAN'S TWELVE" AND
"OCEAN'S THIRTEEN"
It's probable that everyone,
whether he or she wants to
admit it, loves Steven Soder-
bergh's remake of the classic Rat
Pack picture "Ocean's Eleven."
What fewer want to admit is
they actually liked the sequels.
Less coherent narratively? Per-
haps. More self-indulgent? Def-
initely. But with an incredible
soundtrack from David Holmes
and a cast including the likes of
George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt
Damon, Don Cheadle and Andy
Garcia, it's simply too appealing
to balk at. I'm sorry, sue me. But
in my book, "Ocean's Twelve"
and "Ocean's Thirteen" occupy
a secret but substantial page.
NOAH DEAN STAHL

GARTH BROOKS
As the official musical
ambassador for the blue-collar
everyman, Garth Brooks has
sold more albums than any sin-
gle human in American histo-
ry (combined, his albums have
gone platinum 128 times). He
can make you laugh ("Friends
in Low Places"), cry ("The
Dance") and sometimes both
at the same time (the uninten-
tional, tragic hilarity of the
video for "Standing Outside
the Fire").
But there was one thing ol'
Garth could never quite do:
look cool. Between his bizarre
cowboy-chic fashion sense and
that wholly baffling "Chris
Gaines" fiasco, there are plen-
ty of reasons why I must seek
some alone time before I can
comfortably fist-pump along
with "Ain't Going Down ('Til
the Sun Comes Up)."
JEFF SANFORD
"WHITE CHICKS"
Don't look atime like that.
Look, the Wayans Brothers should
never be discounted. They created a
benchmark of '90s humor with "In
LivingColor,"and"ScaryMovie"(the
first) was funny as hell, right? Right?
But 2004's "White Chicks" was
met with unsurprising hostility
both critically and commercially.
Brothers Shawn and Marlon play
two FBI agents who disguise them-
selves as two Paris Hilton-esque
girls. Sounds awful, yes, but it's
actually really clever. Seriously.
Think culture clashing meets
fart jokes, and this movie ain't
half bad. And break-dancing com-
bined with bro-bashing is funnier
than you think.
BLAKE GOBLE

"NOT ANOTHER
TEEN MOVIE"

Let's face it: Almost all parody
movies suck. The ever-looming
problem with satire is descend-
ing too far into stupidity. It's at
its best when it seems to really
love its subject. That's why "Not
Another Teen Movie" works so
well. The film pays wonderful
homage to those guilty pleasure
teen comedies - from "She's
All That" to "The Breakfast
Club" - while also showcasing
why they're so loved in the first
place. It's absolutely ridiculous
while simultaneously being out-
rageously brilliant. More impor-
tantly, it's freaking hilarious, and
the more you watch it, the funni-
er it gets. It just goes to show that
a good "Movie" movie can actu-
ally be made.
SHERIJANKELOVITZ
"YOU'VE GOT MAIL"
If you enjoy browsing
through Pottery Barn catalogs
and dreaming of upward mobil-
ity untouched by moral hazard,
you'll love "You've Got Mail."
The story depicts a New York
of unfussy leather armchairs,
gaily dressed children and
holiday food motifs. Yes, it's a
philosophically bovine world,
but it feels so good. Tom Hanks
and Meg Ryan act out a slight-
ly silly but humble courtship.
Greg Kinnear, Dave Chappelle
and Parker Posey are a tease for
indie fans. The soundtrack rec-
ognizes Harry Nilsson's talents
beyond that lime/coconut song.
This is cinema's equivalent of
Thanksgiving leftovers, and I
challenge you to refuse it.
ABIGAIL B. COLODNER

"THE DARK KNIGHT"
Hindsight's a valuable thing,
and there's a reason we all saw
this 11 times. So much has been
said about Christopher Nolan's
revisionist spectacle, but in
short, "The Dark Knight" is
perfect. Perfect in its mix of art
and entertainment; perfect in its
mass appeal and longevity. An
operatic costume tragedy, it's
a money-maker with guts and
brains. It was easily the greatest
film experience of 2008. Forget
the Oscars. In time, this film
will receive the honors it really
deserves.
BLAKE GOBLE
"MAN ON WIRE"
"ManonWire"covers the schem-
ing behind the red-headed French-
man Philippe Petit's infamous walk
between the Twin Towers. It's
funny, endearing and almost poetic
at times. Petit captured the spirit of
the '70s and the film brings to life
the raw emotion behind his feats.
ZMILY BOUDREAU

"IN BRUGES"
Yes, the film is charming to the
extreme. But there's more to "In
Bruges" than inducing chortles as
Colin Farrell's supposedly tough
hitman swears and trudges his way
through afairy tale village. Death is
an ever-present force on this vaca-
tion, and the movie's final act drives

the mournful, heart-ripping usage
of The Dubliners' song "On Raglan

"WALL-E
The term "movie magic" has
been abducted by Disney (a subsid-
iary of Buy n Large) as a corporate
catchphrase. So it's playing into
the palm of their Mickey Mouse
hand to declare this Pixar's sci-fi
robot romance as such. Yet what
other possible response could one
have to seeing the world's most
adorable trash compactor escape
a demolished Earth, sail into the
outer reaches of the galaxy on the
back of a spaceship that holds his
true love and outstretch his arm
to brush Saturn's rings? Very well:
Magical it is.

"IRON MAN"
One of the most energetic movies of
theyear,"IronMan"closelyfollowsthe
original conic book source material
with nonstop action and pure, unadul-
terated fun. In a timeof complex philo-
sophical/political distractions, the
film is a refreshing change from the
subliminal subtexts that characterize
so many modern superhero movies.
In the end, the success of the movie is
attributed to the basics: keen attention
to the story and eye-opening and origi-
nal visual effects.

"FROST/N IXON"
Based on Peter Morgan's stage
play, "Frost/Nixon" is heavy on
talk but never boring. It's a film
that allows younger audiences to
see further into Richard Nixon's
famous Watergate scandal, an
event that ordinarily seems only
flat and historical. Frank Langella,
as disgraced President Nixon, is
particularly impressive as he por-
trays his character in two differ-
ent lights: a proud public figure
and a more flawed private man. He
humanizes Nixon in a way that is
both endearing and entertaining.
ANNIE LEVENE

"TROPIC THUNDER"
Much has been said about Robert
Downey Jr's exceptional and divi-
sive dip into black-face, but "Tropic
Thunder" has some acute writing
(thanks to Justin Theroux and Ben
Stiller, Downey's co-star and direc-
tor) that should not go unappreciated.
Beginning with lewd and crude faux-
previews, "Thunder" is as politically
incorrect as possible. It adheres to the
no-holds-barred, offend-all-so-as-to-
offend-no-one mantra, but it succeeds
where Howard Stern and other racy
comics fail. "Thunder" has the same
wit and layering as the similar comic
classic "The Three Amigos," and that
Downey character is pretty hilarious.
ELIE ZWIEBEL


"DOUBT"
As producer Scott Rudin said,
"There is nothing postmodern
about this movie." It is simply a
riveting piece of drama. Writer-
director John Patrick Shanley
elicits remarkably strong perfor-
mances from Meryl Streep, Philip
Seymour Hoffman, Amy Adams
and Viola Davis as three mem-
bers of the parish faculty and the
mother of a student, respectively.
Having adapted the script fromhis
own stageplay, Shanley constructs
an entirely enthralling character
piece that only gains more strength
in its execution on screen.

BEST ALBUMS OF 2008
2008 saw a wide range of artists score big with some of their best-ever efforts.
At the dawn of 2009, the Daily Music Staff took a look back with its picks for the best albums of the year.

TV ON THE RADIO
Dear Science
TVon the Radio, buzz band no
more. With the release of Dear
Science, TVOTR has entered
into a rare and hard to define
realm within the music world -
part of a breed of bands that are
respected by all, challenged by
few and envied by their less-tal-
ented peers. Radiohead is in this
category; so was Pavement.
Dear Science is an album
with no unnecessary flourishes,
no out-of-place instrumenta-
tion and no moments that sound
even remotely close to contrived.
Every single note on the album
is essential, like each individual
brushstroke in a masterpiece
painting. From the claps on
"Dancing Choose" to the breezy
synth swells on "DLZ" to Tunde
Adebimpe's sweet falsetto "cry-
i-i-i-ing," TVOTR has crafted
2008's best album, a brilliant
work coming from a band in the
infancy of its career. It's stagger-
ing to even think what's to come.
JEFF SANFORD
FLEET FOXES
Fleet Foxes
The Fleet Foxes things-to-do list
for 2008 might look something like
this: release Sun Giant EP in Janu-
ary; tour relentlessly ina run-down
van through the spring, garnering

much hype for the June release of
the self-titled debut album along
the way; win over audiences and
critics nationwide with pastoral
harmonies and deceptively simple
folk-pop arrangements; get tapped
by Wilco to open for a leg of the
summer tour, circulating a spirited
live collaboration of Bob Dylan's
"I Shall Be Released" around the
Web to show for it; appear on every
late night program on network
television; wind up near the top of
nearly every year-end list known to
humanity; and somehow manage to
do all this in less than 12 months.
Fleet Foxes' quick rise to fame
outside ofthe Pitchforkinner circle
is as much a rags-to-riches story as
any, but the cult of the Foxes stems
largely from the group's ability to
turn any passerby into a believer.
Needless to say, the Foxes can now
afford to fix up their van.
MIKE KUNTZ
MGMT
Oracular Spectacular
From the haunting bubbles
on the intro of "Time to Pre-
tend" to the creepy children
counting down on "Kids,"
MGMT's debut was not to be
overlooked. It combines just
the right amounts of creepy
and cool to make for great elec-
tropop. Equally suited to the
club and to the car, Oracular
Spectacular is full of anthems
you can sing and dance to - so
pick your poison. Maybe that's
why the band broke its way into
so many hearts (and parties)
this year. Then again, maybe
it's just the energy-intensive
retro sound and incomprehen-
sible lyrics that make MGMT
so awkwardly lovable.
SARAH CHAVEY

Graceland, which apparently
influenced their record a little
too much. Ralph Lauren sweat-
ers and classic rock idolatry aside,
Vampire Weekend is a breathtak-
ing synthesis of Afro-pop and
indie-rock that will make the
most uptight hipster loosen up
from the arms-folded, at-atten-
tion position. When it comes to
Vampire Weekend, ignorance is
bliss. So, tune out the critics, put
onyour dancingshoes and bask in
the simple elegance provided by a
truly stunning debutalbum.
DAVID RIVA

PORTISH EAD
Third
After an 11-year hibernation,
former trip-hop trailblazer Por-
tishead has delivered something
much greater than a serviceable
"comeback album." Third is a rare
instance of a band truly redefining
itself. Portishead scraps its creepy/
sexy formula of yore for something
closer to creepy/ugly. As Beth Gib-
bons moans her trademark confes-
sional lyrics over jarringly glitchy
dreamscapes, the band achieves
such hauntingly voyeuristic pathos
that, at times, the album is almost
uncomfortable to listen to. For a
hint at the album's gutting abrasive-
ness, the lead single is aptly titled
"Machine Gun."With Third, Portis-
head has birthed what could easily
be the most innovative album of the
year. And while it may not be pretty,
it's anything but a misfire.
JOSH BAYER
VAMPIRE WEEKEND
Vampire Weekend
2008's dubious "buzz-band"
award goes to none other than
(drum roll please) New York
prep-rockers Vampire Weekend.
These Columbia University grads
have been condemned for their
cleanliness in music and dress
(which apparently makes them
sonically and visually boring)
and have been accused of having
an obsession with Paul Simon's

BON IVER
For Emma, Forever Ago
Given three months alone in
a Wisconsin cabin, most would
whittle the hours away by read-
ing, drinking or maybe just bang-
ing their heads against the wall.
But songwriter Justin Vernon
had loftier goals: He spent his
time creating one of the best
albums of the year and one of
the best musical debuts in recent
memory. For Emma, Forever Ago
is a spare and ethereal alt-folk
affair guidedby Vernon's anemic
falsetto. Its deliberate pacing
and dynamic control make the
journey from the. plaintive chill
of "Flume" to the triumphant
thaw of "For Emma" a memo-
rable one.
JACK PORTER

refreshing in a year suffering
from a drought of good, old-fash-
ioned indie rawk (in other words,
it's good).
There's always going to be a
demand for well-crafted songs
with sticky melodies, and Deer-
hunter fills it here with confec-
tionary aplomb. Oh, and Bradford
Cox's wistfully milky tenor is
cause enough for a love letter.

STEPHEN MALKMUS & THE JICKS
Real Emotional Trash
Inayearpackedwithcomplexand
multi-layered albums, Stephen Mal-
kmus and his backing Jicks seem-
ingly decided to just sit down and
record some really great jam-ses-
siony tracks. Songs like "Real Emo-
tional Trash" ramble on forever, but
they never feel too long. And Malk-
mus still has a talent for enveloping
listeners in quirky, meandering tales
("Hopscotch Willie") andcommand-
ing roars like Pavement on steroids
("Baltimore"). It's nothing too com-
plex and nothingtoo astounding, but
Real Emotional Trash is clearly one
of 2008's most pleasing, seemingly
simple albums, and it stands above a
whole lot of others.
MATT EMERY

DEERHUNTER
Microcastle
Whatever the "X Factor" is,
Deerhunter's got it.
On paper, Microcastle isn't
going anywhere indie music
hasn't been a billion times before.
Dreamy, delay pedal-smitten
opener? Check. Swirly My Bloody
Valentine tribute? Check. Lazy-
river guitar balladry that explodes
two-thirds of the way through
into a surging coda of crystal-
line noise? Check. But something
about Microcastle is supremely

Times New Viking
Rip It Off
With their densest serving
of lo-fi squalor yet, Times New
Viking proved just how listen-
able pure cacophony can be.
On the trio's third album, mel-
odies, guitar riffs and synth
licks bleed together into a
swollen mass of tape-bursting
sound. Still, the barely-distin-
guishable, co-ed vocal attack
of Beth Murphy and Adam
Elliott is so fun that the entire
affair is almost childish, but
the feedback burst it pierces
through is so abrasive it should
be x-rated. Completely disre-
specting basic audio conven-
tions, the distorted bubblegum
of Rip It Off relies entirely on
energy for its thrills. And that
energy is undepletable.

Hipster label shouldn't stick

OCTOBER 12TH, 2008 -
The need to slap a label on
every single person is getting out
of hand. The other night, while
telling a bad joke involving baked
goods and a great deal of profan-
ity, I was accused of being a hipster.
The punch line was a tough one to
follow unless you strongly grasp
irony, and while several people in
my group of acquaintances gave a
chuckle, one girl turned her nose
up at me. Her voice dripping with
sarcasm, she growled, "Wow,
you're so ironic. You trendy little
hipster you."
Color me confused, because I'm
about as non-hip as a person can
get. I mean, for God's sake, I have
a collection of plastic dinosaurs
in my bedroom. Since when does
that make a person hip? And since
when have hipsters been able to
corner the market on concepts like
irony? So either I'm a hipster with-
out knowing it, or people have an
obsession with tacking on labels
that don't exactly fit.
For those of you who are living
on the moon rather than campus,
people tend to give the bare-bones
definition of hipster as someone

with a hoity-toity taste in indepen-
dent music. These are the cats who
can explain the difference between
the "electrosonic" and "shoe-
gaze" genres, plus list 99 reasons
why your favorite band sucks. But
increasingly, "hipster" indicates
an entire lifestyle. It's claimed that
they dress a certain way (thrifty),
live a certain way (vegan) and even
think a certain way (dog-eared
copy of "Catcher in the Rye"). This,
coupled with hipsters' reputed
sense of entitlement, means that
everyone else is supposed to revile
them. God knows you don't want
to be called a hipster, you stuck-up
jerk.
Just go and asksomeone who, for
all intents and purposes, is a text-
book example of a hipster. You're
likely to get similar answers: "God
no, I'm not one of those." "Maybe
I like this band, but I'm not like
them." "I think I'd kill myself if
people thought'of me like that." So
should we believe them or the peo-
ple who are branding them? Are
these hipsters some sort of snobby
hive mind, or are they individuals
expressing their beliefs and inter-
ests?

The answer is clear - like all
labels, hipster just doesn't fit.
I would like to think that group-
ing people into convenient stereo-
types had gone out of style in high
school,butapparentlythat's notthe
case. I can't even count how often I
hear people sneering about frater-
nity brothers and sorority sisters,
as if the simple act of wearing a
polo shirt somehow automatically
lowers one's IQ by about 20 points.
But some of the smartest and hard-
est-working people I know are
involved in Greek life. The truth of
the matter is that there is almost a
compulsion to stereotype.
We want to feel special. Other-
wise, we wouldn't waste so much
time categorizing everyone else.
In high school, there's a myriad of
social groups that we construct for
ourselves: the jocks and the nerds,
the preps and the punks. Certainly
some types of people tend to stick
together, but how many do that
based on label rather than person-
ality?
And while we tend to put oth-
ers in groups and sneer derisively
at them, we categorize ourselves.
Because let's face it, it's much more

time-efficient to look at a person's
clothes and friends and smack
them with a label. It's also an easy
way to feel inherently superior to
someone.
But I think the obsession with
belonging to - or distancing your-
self from - a particular group can
have detrimental effects on what
you get out of life. Consider the
movie "Juno." When I discussed it
with people who knew about so-
called hipster culture they sneered.
"God, it was trying too hard to be
quirky. It's a trashy hipster movie."
But those who were unfamil-
iar with hipster counter-culture
thought it was cute, and took the
quirky humor at face value.
I'm not saying you're shallow if
you didn't enjoy "Juno." I'm saying
that some people get carried away
with assuming everyone belongs
to a particular group. So don't
judge just because someone has
horn-rimmed glasses or an ironic
T-shirt. It's starting to feel like a
war zone out here; labels are fly-
ing in all directions, and I'm afraid
they'll start to stick.

feminist ideals and an "Out Night"
program that centers on LGBT
issues.
"With animation you see a lot of
films that deal with very graphic -
whether it's graphically funny or
graphically violent- subject matter

rison said. He cautioned that many
of the films in the animation cat-
egory will be very intense and that
the program is not for everybody.
Almost all screenings will be
held at the Michigan Theater,
except for a midnight movie ("The

handful of lectures attheWorkGal-
lery and a music video showcase at
the newly renovated UMMA Stern
Auditorium. The festival's organiz-
ers also intend to expand the scope
of the festival far beyond past years:
Visitors can seek out an "alternative
walking tour" of Ann Arbor and an
international film tour featuring
selections from the festival, which
is scheduled to hit the road in June.
Harrison pointed out how these
efforts fit into the theme of geogra-
phy and travel.
"We're going to do more to make
it so there's not things just happen-
ing at the Michigan Theater," Har-
rison said, adding that he's hoping
local businesses will get into the
action as well. "You're going to see
more things happening throughout
town."
Jennifer Yin, a senior in
the Business School and a col-
lege representative for Fias-
co's record label, arranged the
event.
"He's real, he's not going to
hide anything in. He's not going
to pretend like he's not going to

well. I think he's very respectful.
That's who he is - that's the type
of person he is."


FILM INDUSTRY
From Page 3D
After "Youth in Revolt" left the
city, others followed. Part of Drew
Barrymore's roller derby film
"Whip It!" was filmed in Ypsilanti
in late August. The cast members
made Ann Arbor club Necto their
late-night destination one Friday.
Necto owner Scot Greig said the
visit from Barrymore and about 20
other people was unexpected, and
though he gave the group the club's
VIP room, they preferred to walk
around the club and mingle with
the crowd.
In mid-November, when an
existing metro Detroit location fell
through for the raunchy Rob Sch-
neider comedy "Virgin on Bourbon
Street," the crew used Ingalls Mall
on short notice.
The arrival of the "Betty Anne
Waters" cast and crew marks the
first long-term, major project to be
filmed in the city - and the first
time residents and businesses in
Ann Arbor can truly evaluate the
extended effects of the tax incen-
tive program.
The movie, based off a true story,
follows a woman's attempts to
prove the innocence of her brother,
who was convicted of a murder he
didn't commit. She puts herself
through law school and exhausts
his appeals in hopes of proving him
innocent.
"Betty Anne Waters" will be set
in Massachusetts, and producer
Andrew Sugerman said he consid-
ered filming in both Massachusetts
and Rhode Island before deciding
on Ann Arbor. Though the primary
reason for shooting in Michigan
was the financial incentive, Suger-
man said he specifically found Ann
Arbor attractive because the archi-
tecture in the city was similar to
New England's.
When filming starts in February,
only about 20 percent of the film
will be shot on campus, he said,
with much of the movie set in a

private home. He declined to name
specific University or off-campus
shooting locations.
"We're not seeing that much
exterior scenes and streets," Suger-
man said. "A large portion is in inte-
riors. And the days we are shooting
exteriors, it will be cold, so I don't
think it will be that much fun to
watch for long hours."
Sugerman said about 60 percent
of the "Betty Anne Waters" crew
will be brought in from out of state,
especially for technical positions.
The movie plans to hire local extras
and possibly actors for some of the
film's smaller roles.
FILM STUDENTS SHUN
L.A. AND STAY
The biggest piece of the Ann
Arbor economy isn't local business-
es - it's the University. And with
the incentive, some students are
finding opportunitiesto become a
part of the state's fledgling movie
industry.
Burnstein, who also heads the
screenwriting program at the Uni-
versity, said this is the first year
that a significant number of Michi-
gan film students are staying in
the state after graduation instead
of immediately leaving for Los
Angeles to find work.
One recent graduate landed
his first out-of-college job when
Burnstein referred him to "Youth
in Revolt" director MiguelArteta,
who was looking to hirea student
as his assistant while he and Cera
made changes to the script.
"After a few days, (the student)
says to Miguel, 'Is it okay if I say
something? I sort of got an idea,'
" Burnstein said. "So he tells him,
and it's great. It's in the script.
This kid who's three days out of
school has now played a vital role
in the end of the production."
For other students in the Uni-
versity's Screen Arts and Cul-
tures program, the rebate money
has allowed them a larger budget
to make independent films. This
summer, LSA senior Eddie Rubin
and University alum Debashis

Mazumder co-produced the film
"Art House," about a co-op of art
students who risk getting evicted
if they don't prove they can be pro-
ductive artists.
"Art House" was shot entirely
in Ann Arbor, mainly at Black Elk
Co-Op House near the corner of
Washtenaw Avenue and Hill Street
and at Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity
on Oxford Street.
Although the majority of the
actors and crew came from in state,
the film hired the lead actors, pro-
duction designer and sound crew
from outside of Michigan. Rubin
said that if not for the tax incen-
tive, the film wouldn't have had
the money to approach talent like
Iggy Pop (from Iggy Pop and the
Stooges) or Tim Brennen ("Han-
cock"), who both had sizable roles
in the film.
AFarmingtonHillsnative,Rubin
said he plans to stay in Michigan
after graduation to continue his
film work. Having founded the pro-
duction company Deep Blue Pic-
tures with University alum Danny
Mooney in 2007, Rubin said he has
recently been talking with several
out-of-state producers, directors

and investors to fund scripts and
get films into production.
"We're trying to really bring
people back," Rubin said. "A lot of
our friends who have moved up to
L.A. and New York are continually
coming back to Michigan for work
and auditions, and we're trying to
set ourselves up as one of the pre-
mier production companies here in
Michigan."
BUILDING THE
FLEDGLING INDUSTRY
While the immediate results
of the initiative are encouraging,
Michigan has some work to do to
reap the maximum benefits.
The state's inexperienced work-
force and lack of permanent infra-
structure present problems to
filmmakers looking to shoot here.
Without sound stages and studios
in the state, post-production must
happen elsewhere after a film
wraps up shooting in Michigan. A
lack of studios also makes it diffi-
cult to shoot in the winter, prevent-
ing the industry from providing a
year-round source of revenue.
Other states with successful tax
credit programs have followed up
by developing infrastructure -

Louisiana now has six soundstages
and studios in its three largest cit-
ies. Michigan started to take that
nextstep in early January, whenthe
Michigan Film Office announced
plans to build three production stu-
dios in the state.
"The Steam Experiment" pro-
ducer Martinez said the program's
success in Michigan can only be
evaluated after a minimum of five
to 10 years, after investment oppor-
tunities start to take shape and the
reputation of the state as a good
filming location flourishes among
filmmakers.
"If it's not a permanent program,
that would be a waste," Martinez
said. "Those tax incentives make
sense only if there is a long-term
plan."
Both Martinez and "Youth in
Revolt" producer Permut noticed
on their sets that crewmembers
hired in state hadn't quite learned
the ropes of the industry yet.ww
"If you go to Louisiana today and
you want to hire someone for a job,
you have the choice of 10to 12 peo-
ple that apply for that specific job,
and they are very, very qualified,"
Martinez said. "In Michigan, you

have a couple. So that means that
what we had to do on this film was
train alot of people."
Both the tax credit percentage
and the amount of funding required
to launch a new industry are high,
but Burnstein estimated that for
everyrebate-eligible dollarspenton
production, three more are spent in
the local economy - meaning small
businesses stand the most to gain
from the tax credit program.
And it can't be ignored that
one of the industry's main advan-
tages is its glamour - especially
in Michigan, where a little star-
studded stimulus could go a long
way in counterbalancing the dis-
mal economic news preoccupying
residents.
"People can read the front page
stories and see Hollywood is tak-
ing notice of Michigan, and then
they go to the movies and see it
up there on the screen," Burnstein
said. "You don't think people take
pride in that? 'Hey, that was my
neighborhood.... That is my friend's
house they shot at.' That's worth
something, and to not figure that
into the equation would be a huge
mistake."

in the bands themselves is all the
assurance they need.

"They love what they do," says
Caleb Dillon of Starling Electric,
a vibrant quartet which released
its stunning Clouded Staircase
last year, and will be playing at the
Blind Pig Friday night with Light-
ning Love. "Just like us, when they
hear something they really love,
they go out and tell people about
it."
Despite so much support from
all involved in the local scene, the
student crowd as a whole doesn't
always reflect their enthusiasm.
It's hard to blame them, consider-
ing the array of parties and clubs

that decorate Ann Arbor nightlife,
though many would say students
just have too much going on.
"It seems like (students) are
pulled in a lot of directions at once.
They're involved with too many
things to take the time to come
out to shows all the time," Caleb
said. "And ina city as active as Ann
Arbor, it's difficult to know every-
thing that's going on atonce."
But behind the cynicism and
unimportance typically placed
around local music, there's always
the hope that someone will take a
chance. Someone will walk over to
Wazoo or Underground Sounds or
stop by the Blind Pig and be pleas-
antly surprised by that one band
that had all those posters. With the
constant influx of students, there
are always people willing to take
that chance. In a local scene as sto-
ried, dynamic and eclectic as Ann
Arbor's, there's no doubt people
will continue to find music worth
sharing with the world.

UMMA
From Page 4D
Seniors may have vague memo-
ries of UMMA's pop art or history
of photography exhibitions or of
the great black wing of Charles
Ginnever's "Daedalus" draped
over the front lawn. (The sculpture
has been moved to the South Uni-
versity side of the building, with
"Orion" taking its original place.)
UMMA closed in June 2006, giv-
ing them some time to pack up the
collections before breaking ground
in September of that year.
"We've really been pushing
to get this open because another
class graduates," Steward said.
"Two and a half years is more than
half the average student's (under-
graduate career)."
The corridor that connects the
old and new buildings, with tall
glass lenses opening onto views
of campus, seamlessly blends old

and new, interior and exterior.
The weathered sandstone of the
old exterior, rosy from 101 years
of oxidization, is paired with new
sandstone from the same quarry,
framing the passageway. A few
steps further, you can see the
Wisconsin limestone of the new
addition. The clear glass windows
allow for another degree of "out-
side-in."
"Art isn't just something you
experience when you're inside this
building," Steward said.
So many aspects of the renewed
UMMA, in form and purpose,
feed into the belief that art can be
part of the everyday experience.
While there's sometimes the con-
ception that art museums are a
place of exclusivity, of high culture
and pretension and a ban on cell-
phones, it doesn't have to be that
way - and the new UMMA will
work to encourage the idea that
an art museum is for everyone and
anyone.

It's the Coen brothers at their
most bizarre yet, so of course it's
hilarious. "Burn After Reading"
stars Brad Pitt, George Clooney
(that's enough right there) and Fran-
ces McDormand. Pitt is a meathead
who believes he has uncovered FBI
secrets, McDormand is a physical
trainer who just wants some plas-
tic surgery and Clooney keeps a sex
machine in hisbasement. Through a
series of unusual coincidences, their
lives become entangled in one of the
biggestgovernmentmisunderstand-

"Beyond Our Ken"
If you stumble upon this cult
documentary, you'll find yourself
quoting it for a lifetime. But that
shouldn't be the only reason to

see this superb observation of the
Australian cult Kenja, named for
founders Ken Dyers and Jan Ham- S

you'll want to transfer energy, put

this was the most unique.

"THE VICTORS"- the University of Michigan
fight song - is one of the best college renditions
in the country. Learn this song and grow to love
it, because you will sing it at all of the Michigan
varsity sports games. Whether you like basketball,
football, ice hockey or baseball, one of Michigan's
25 teams is sure to be something you'll enjoy
watching. From witnessing junior basketball
superstar Manny Harris deliver a momentum-
swinging dunk at Crisler Arena to seeing senior
Brandon Minor score on a 40-yard scamper at
the Big House, your Michigan experience is not
complete without one thing: sports. So grab
your student t-shirt and a group of friends and
get rowdy as you cheer on the maize and blue.

Are you a die-hard Michigan football fan?
Do you plan on just going to the games

yes to any one of these questions, you're

your game-day experience could shake

Last season, Michigan's basketball
team did the unthinkable. It made the
NCAA Tournament for the first time
in 11 years, winning an astounding
21 games before being bounced out
of the tournament in the Sweet 16 by
Oklahoma. With junior Manny Harris
and senior Deshawn Sims leading the
charge, Michigan will hopefully repeat
last year's success. Next season, the
Wolverines will definitely look to head
back to the Big Dance and advance
deeper in the Tourney. SEE PAGE 5E

Rich Rod's miscues repeated in new gig-

"I think we took more of a
businesslike approach to it at the
start, as opposed to a more personal
approach. And that's something, in
retrospect, I'd probably have done
differently.
"They had no idea whatourcoaches
were really like. They didn't know us.
"Sometimes you get caught up
fin the business aspect] at this level
because, let's face it, it's bigdollars, big
importance to a lot offolks. AndIsee
coaches, myself included, who don't
take the time and effort to be around
the players more in a non-football
atmosphere."
- Rich Rodriguez
"The onlythings wish Iwould have
had in the last seven, eight months, is
I wish I had more time to spend with
the players.
"My upperclassmen, Ihaven'tbeen
to their homes. I haven't had a chance
to see where they grew up or lived or
meet some of their coaches. Imeta lot
of their parents, but some of them I
haven't met.
"That's the only regret, is that I
wish I had been able to spend some
time with the players - my assistant
coaches and the staff members, too.
You spend time with them, you know
exactly what makes them tick."
- Rich Rodriguez
NOVEMBER 19TH, 2008 -
Those two quotations look
pretty similar, right? It's
the same person saying
essentially the
same thing.
But
Rodriguez said
them seven
years apart.
Rodriguez
made the first DAN
statement to FELDMAN
the Charleston
(W.Va.)Gazette
after his first year at WestVirginia

should have been a larger
emphasis in spring practice and
fall camp. Rodriguez could have
taken some time away from going
over schemes and techniques to
learn about the guys who would
be executing them.
It's hard to argue using all that
time to prepare actually paid off.
Just look at the product on the
field.
Think the personal connection
between a player and a coach
doesn't matter?
Just look at Michigan's upset of
double-digit favoriteFloridainthe
Capital One Bowl on New Year's
Day, Lloyd Carr's final game:'As
much as Carr tried to downplay
that the bowl was his final game,
then-defensive coordinator
Ron English interrupted Carr's
halftime speech.
"Let's play for this man?"
English said, according to the
Associated Press.
The Wolverines went wild and
finished their throttling of the
Gators.
That was a Michigan team that
didn't beat Appalachian State and
lost its final two regular-season
games. But those Wolverines
loved Carr and weren't going to
let him go out with a loss.
Senior nose tackle Terrance
Taylor talked fondly Monday
about Carr's habit of punching
him every time the two crossed
paths. Taylor said he doesn't
have a custom like that with
Rodriguez.
Rodriguez will develop a
similar rapport with his .players
over the next few years, but he
should have known to force it
sooner. He was just too stubborn,
too set in his ways that had been
so successful at West Virginia
during the last few years.
This doesn't mean Rodriguez
won't win in Ann Arbor. In fact,

his headstrong nature suggests
he will. Rodriguez is 9-31-1 in
his first years at a job, but he's
99-39-1 in his other 12 years as a
head coach.
His track record suggested
struggles this year, and it says
he will be successful from here
on out. If he sticks to his plan,
there's no reason his future at
Michigan won't follow a similar
script.
But this is his fourth head-
coaching gig. He should have
learned how to handle this
transition year better.
Shortly before last Saturday's
pregame Senior Day festivities,
senior defensive back Brandon
Harrison couldn't find his
parents, who he thought would
drive up from Ohio for the
game. Rodriguez saw Harrison's
concern, grabbed him and said,
'C'mon, let's go.' Rodriguez
walked by Harrison's side under
the banner and then hugged him.
It turns out an accident on
the highway slowed Harrison's
parents, and they had just made
it to the tunnel when he walked
across the field. But he won't
forget the kindness of Rodriguez,
who Harrison said could have told
him to stay back or walk alone.
"I justsee him a whole different
way," Harrison said. "I used to
look at him as just my head coach,
but now I look at him, it's just a
different type of bond."
But it's too late. The Wolverines
willgointo Columbuson Saturday
with virtually no chance of
upsetting Ohio State, and much of
the reason is because their coach
let them down.
Rodriguez was at Harrison's
side Saturday. But he should have
been there all season.

JEREMY CHo/Daly
Michigan coach Rich Rodriguez failed in his first year to establish personal relationships with his players until it was too late.

in 2001. The second came at his
weekly press conference two
days after the Wolverines lost to
Toledo.
Seven years later, Rodriguez is
repeating the same mistakes that
made the Mountaineers 3-8 in his
first year in Morgantown, W. Va.
Michigan wasn't going to be
great this year - not with just
two offensive starters returning
and the four leading tacklers
of a year ago departing. But the
Wolverines should have been
better.
And much of the blame falls on
Rodriguez.
Not because he didn't adapt
his spread offense enough. Not
because he didn't name captains
before the season. Not because
he took too long to identify which

players should be starters.
Because Rodriguez forgot the
little things a coach needs to do
to build a winner.
Going 32-5 and playing in two
BCS bowls in his last three years
at West Virginia will do that to
you. But that's not a legitimate
excuse for leading Michigan to its
most losses in 129 seasons.
Rodriguez admitted he should
have made the effort to know his
players better on a personal level.
He should have known better in
the first place.
"He needs to know what's
going to motivate you, and he
needs to know how he can do that
best," redshirt junior right guard
David Moosman said. "And being
a player, you need to know that
it's not personal. It's not an attack

against you."
A few weeks ago, Moosman
said there had been some
separate issues between players
and coaches, but they were being
worked out.
But Rodriguez announced
Tuesday that sophomore wide
receiver Zion Babb is no longer
with the team and, according to
persistent rumors, sophomore
safety Artis Chambers and
freshman running back Sam
McGuffie are also weighing a
transfer.
It's clear Rodriguez hasn't
ironed out all the problems.
Distractions like these are
unheard of during Ohio State
week, when all focus is usually on
beating the Buckeyes.

Ohio State defensive lineman Nathan Williams celebrates after tackling Michigan running back Michael Shaw (20) during
Saturday's game in Columbus. Ohio State upended Michigan 42-7, capping the Wolverines' worst season in 129 years at

Misery in Columbus

Two Daily writers
break down your
football Saturday

Daily StaffReporter
Although the beginning of your
college experience may be full
of hundreds of pages to read and
papers to write, you'll always have
a unique distraction from it, at least
for the first few months, thanks to
the Saturday home football games.
Since a handful of home games
start at 12, chances are you'll be
awake before 9 a.m. getting all
dolled up in maize and blue and a
"Go Blue" temporary tattoo on your
cheek.
A highly recommended addition
to your outfit would be a small
clutch (since you can't bring in big
purses or bags to the stadium) to
hold a few essentials and of course,

the greatest fight song in the land:
"The Victors."
While throwing on your maize
student t-shirt, you might ask your-
self, "Am I really supposed to be
waking up this early for a 12-o'clock
football game?" Of course you are!
While you think you are the only
one up this early to tailgate, just wait
until you hit State Street. And when
you pass the Michigan Union a few
minutes later, that's when the real
party begins.
There is no better energy rush
than seeing hundreds of fans - most
of them your fellow classmates -
tossing the pigskin, blaring music,
grilling burgers and "welcoming" the
opponent's fans to Ann Arbor. And

Once you're all ready to go,
you'll make your way down to a
cafeteria to get a much-needed cup
of coffee along with a brunch-style
meal before you and your friends
continue on your way to the football
stadium.
As you continue toward the
stadium,you'll come across multiple
fraternities and other houses
blasting music with the brothers
and homeowners gladly inviting
you to join in the festivities on their
front porch and lawn.
You'll find out that everyone is
laughing, dancing and having a
good old time while many of them
are holding "shady red cups," a can
of beer or even drinking from a
bag of wine, strategically avoiding
stepping on the sidewalk with any
of these in hand.
As you continue on your way,

barbeque will permeate the air as
you walk along side hundreds of

runs up to you and yells "Got" in your
face. Justreturnthe favor and scream
back "Blue?"
After doing some frat hopping and
stopping off at a few of your friends'
houses to quench your thirst, it is
probably a good idea to grab some-
thing to eat. Whip out that Mcard of
yours and head over to South Quad,
where you can have that perfect
game-day breakfast beginning at
10 a.m. But do that quickly, because
spending more than 15 minutes
in South Quad is considered some
severe time mismanagement.
And when you head back out for
round number two, there are not
just hundreds of people walking the
streets but thousands.
As atrue UofMfan,itis absolutely
necessary to arrive at the stadium a
few minutes before kick-off to wit-
ness the most famous entrance in all
of sports. So round up your friends
and follow the crowds to the gates
of the Big House. After locating your
section number and strolling down

people heading towards the same
location.
Once you're close, and provided
you still have time, I'd advise buying
a hot dog at one of the many stands
near the stadium if you're hungry
or stopping by a tailgate or two to
socialize if you know anyone there
(the food there is usually pretty
good as well).
Once you've entered the stadium,
you'll go and find your seat and get
to know some of the people around
you. If that doesn't sound like your
cup of tea, feel free to move over to
where some of your friends may be
sitting if they're not already near
you.(I believe I sat in my actual seat
only once or twice the whole season,
so don't worry).
Now that you're all seated and
situated, get ready to standup, cheer
and enjoy the game. Whatever your
reason for going, there are plenty
of Saturdays to come in which the
work you have to get done doesn't
exist, at least for those few hours.
to your seat, you can see your team
run out of the tunnel and touch the
GO BLUE banner, sing "The Vic-
tors" several times and listen to the
announcer list the starting lineups.
Now, it's game-time.
For the next four hours, you are
likely to be part of the largest crowd
to attend a sporting event that day.
After watching a few Tate Forcier
touchdowns and 50-plus yard runs
by Brandon Minor, it's safe to say that
because Michigan is the winningest
program in college football, you can
expect to leave the stadium basking
in yet another victory (well,let's hope
so).
At this point, moststudents like to
grab a bite to eat from a State Street
shop or the Union, which provides
a great opportunity to discuss the
game.

exhausted. But after a few-hour nap,
you will be ready to head out for the
night and celebrate avictory.
Welcome to life as a Michigan
Wolverine.

NOVEMBER 24TH,2008 -
COLUMBUS - Entering Satur-
day's game, the only thing left to
lose was the last bit of pride.
And somehow, the Michigan
football team managed to fumble
that away, too.
Before going to Ohio Stadium, it
hadn't been completely clear when
the 3-9 Wolver-
ines would hit
rock bottom. It
felt like it after
the Illinois
blowout. Maybe
it was after the
Toledo embar- COURTNEY
rassment, or RATKOWIAK
when Michigan
lost to Notre Dame, Michigan State
or Purdue.
But it became obvious at the
end of Saturday's misery. As the
Buckeyes stomped on the Wolver-
ines' pride one last time and the
Ohio State students rushed the
field, junior running back Brandon
Minor slowly walked off the field
with his helmet in his hand.
In the lowest point of the worst
season in Michigan history, was he
really trying to soak it all in?
"Yeah, basically," Minor said,
slowly and sadly, right before he
was grabbed by the shoulder and
pulled away by a member of the
Michigan staff.
But now that the season is over,
there are a few positives looking
forward - well, the main one is
probably just that this year is over.
The Wolverines can hope it
won't be as bad next season.
"Ain't going to happen on my
watch as a senior next year," Minor

said in his postgame press confer-
ence. .
But the Wolverines seemed to
believe that at the beginning of
this year, too. This time around,
they'll have to understand where
they went wrong Saturday - and
this season - before they try to fix
those problems next spring.
PREGAME
Before it even started, the big-
gest rivalry game in college football
was already irrelevant. The ABC
broadcasters estimated just 200 of
the 105,564 fans in the stands were
Michigan fans, and it was easy to
believe that, looking out at the solid
red crowd.
Rodriguez had been accused
of not seeing the importance of
the Michigan-Ohio State rivalry
before coaching in The Game, and
the questions about it had already
become annoyingly repetitive by
the time Ohio State week rolled
around.
It still wasn't clear he under-
stood on Saturday. Next season,
he has to prove he knows. Espe-
cially in a transition period where
so much of Michigan tradition is
being overhauled, the rivalry can't
be overstated enough. Bo Schem-
bechler made his team do drills in
sets of 50 the year after Michigan's
50-14 loss to the Buckeyes. And
next year, Rodriguez should make
sure two sets of numbers from this
season aren't forgotten: 3-9 and
42-7.
After Saturday's loss, Rodriguez
said, "The quieter I am, the less
drama I have to deal with." But
next year, he needs to emphasize
the importance of the rivalry so

much that Michigan fans are sick
of hearing about it before the game
happens.
It's not just any other game.
When Jim Tressel came to Ohio
State andspoke at his first pep rally,
he made sure Buckeyes fans knew
success started with a win in Ann
Arbor - and he's now 7-1 against
the Wolverines.
ON THE FIELD
When the going got tough this
season, Rodriguez often used the
number of months he's been the
Michigan head coach as an excuse.
"Nine months," he said back in
September, answering a question
about his team's progress with a
dramatic pause for effect. "Nine
months."
It was the same the next month
before the Minnesota game.
"Ten months. Geez," he told
reporters exasperatedly, when
asked to evaluate how he's been as
the coach.
But 11 months after he was hired,
his team looked shockingly similar
to how it did in August.
A meager offense featuring a bad
offensive line and an erratic quar-
terback.
A defense that gave up the big
plays.
A return game that couldn't hold
onto the ball.
Rodriguez constantly says
that he can see progress in prac-
tice Sunday through Friday that
doesn't show up on the field. Satur-
day showed fans can no longer give
him the benefit of the doubt - in
terms of the season, there was no
improvement to speak of.

Will 'M' turn it around?

By RUTH LINCOLN
Daily Sports Writer
For many, football Saturdays
define one's Michigan experience.
Little compares to the trek down
State Street and then over to Hoover,
slowly approaching the giant
Block-M scoreboard and sitting with
100,000-plus ofyour closest friends.
And for years the Michigan foot-
ball team has delivered with early-
season blowouts over mid-major
teams followed by grinding contests
with perennial Big Ten foes. And for
years the end result was expected
-- A Michigan win. But after last
season's program-record nine loss-
es, the Wolverine faithful can rally
around a simple message: It can't get
much worse.
QUESTIONS AT QB
For the second straight season,
there are big questions at the most
important position on the field. As
Steven Threet and Nick Sheridan-
learned last season, being a quar-
terback in the spread offense is
noeasy task. Last season, neither
Threet nor Sheridan could estab-
lish any consistency as the Wol-
verines grudgingly stumbled to a
3-9 record. As Rodriguez support-
ers have preached all along, once
Michigan recruited the right play-
ers, everything else should fall into
place. And with Threet heading to

Arizona State and Sheridan coming ful. Either couldbe the guy to prove
back from a leg injury suffered dur- the spread offense can be a success,
ing spring practice, there's plenty of but if he doesn't, the blame will lie

room for Rodriguez's young guns to
showcase their skill.
For freshman Tate Forcier, that
meant taking the lead reins during
spring ball once Sheridan was side-
lined. Forcier enrolled last January
and got a semester jump on learn-
ing the offense. Although he is only
6-foot-1185 pounds, the San Diego
native has the arm strength and
speed to be a great college quar-
terback. Forcier showed glimpses
of greatness back in April and
impressed the 50,000-plus at the
annual spring game. Many expect
Forcier to revitalize a frustrated
fanbase and bring Michigan back
among the BCS's best. But for a true
freshman, that task seems rather
mighty.
Denard Robinson, who arrived in
Ann Arbor in June, will be another
option at quarterback. The freshman
is known primarily for his speed and
set state track records this season in
Florida. Forcier looked solid in the
spring, but don't expect Rodriguez
to divulge the front runner just yet.
They very well could trade snaps all
throughout the season.
Neither Forcier nor Robinson
have huge shoes to fill from last
year, but they potentially carry an
offense on their shoulders that has
yet to win over the Wolverine faith-

squarely on Rodriguez's shoulders.
And who knows how many seasons
Rodriguez will have to prove it.
WILL MICHIGAN MAKE IT
BACK TO A BOWL GAME?
At this time last season, Michi-
gan held three prestigious college
football records - best all-time
winning percentage, most all-
time wins and longest Bowl streak
appearances. Now, just two of those
three records hold true. After Pur-
due handed the Wolverines their
seventhloss of the season on Nov. 1,
there was no hope, Michigan would
be bowl ineligible for the first time
in 33 years.
For those accustomed to travel-
ing each frigid Michigan winter
to the Rose Bowl and other New
Year's Day Bowl games, the thought
of watching the Ball drop in Times
Square from the comfort of one's
own home seemed bizarre. But that
was last year's reality.
Even withouta Big Ten title or an
Ohio State victory (Michigan hasn't
won The Game since 2003), Rodri-
guez could win over more fans if
Michigan can make it back to a
Bowl Game. For that to happen, the
Wolverines must win at least seven
games and in some instances, six
games will qualify.

Minor uses reckless

Beilein has made Michigan

abandon on the field a Tournament-caliber team

By DAN FELDMAN
Daily SportsEditor
NOVEMBER 12TH, 2008 -
Junior running back Brandon
Minor has taken three direct snaps
in the Michigan football team's last
two games. Each time he lowered
his head and ran.
But will he ever throw when he
lines up under center?
"I loverunningtheballtoomuch
to pass it," Minor said. "I doubt it."
Although Michigan football
coach Rich Rodriguez said Minor
was always considered the start-
er, the Richmond, Va., native had
just 13 carries in the Wolverines'
first six games as he dealt with an
assortment of injuries.
Minor sulked during the early
part of the season with his reduced
role. Thoughts of never getting his
chance to show what he can do and
even transferring crossed his mind.
His sense of humor didn't show as
often as it normally did.
"I just zoned out," Minor said.
"I wasn't joking around in practice
like I usually do. I wasn't talking
much at all. I was just trying to
affect the plays."
He tried talking to his coaches,
but that didn't get anywhere. Then
he turned to his mom, brother and
old coaches.
"They was like, 'Stay with it.
Fight it out,' " Minor said. "They
was saying they know me better
than that."
Minor said his attitude improved
in the week leading up to Michi-
gan's Sept. 27 game against Wis-

consin. The results weren't evident
until Minor started at Penn State
four games later. Minor has had
more carries in each of the last
four games than the first six games
combined.
In the three-game stretch start-
ing with the Nittany Lions, Minor
accounted for 41 percent of Michi-
gan's offense, 63 percent of its
touchdowns and 53 percent of its
scoring.
Duringthat run, Minor returned
to his old form - having no regard.
NO REGARD FOR HIS BODY
Minor was knocked out of the
Wolverines' game at Minnesota
in the third quarter with what
Rodriguez initially thought was a
separated shoulder. Rodriguez was
asked about Minor's status Mon-
day.
"He's got sore ribs," Rodriguez
said. "He's got a sore shoulder. He's
got a sore wrist."
And that doesn't even include
the hamstring injury that nagged
him earlier this season.
Rodriguez said Minor didn't
practice Tuesday and is "very
questionable" for Saturday's game
against Northwestern.
"He's a tough guy," Rodriguez
said. "And I'm sure if he's able to go
at all during practice this week, he
will."
The coach added that Minor has
picked up the schemes well enough
that he could miss practice for most
of the week and still play against
Northwestern.

MARCH 16TH, 2008 - John Beil-
ein jumped out of his large leather
chair, embraced his wife and chil-
dren to his right and ran on to his
jubilant players.
The man who had just been hid-
ing his inevitable nerves, sitting
calmly, with his legs crossed and
left hand sitting reassuringly on
the back of redshirt freshman Laval
Lucas-Perry's chair, was ecstatic.
With hundreds of screaming
fans in Crisler Arena, Michigan's
men's basketball coach had just
led his team to something huge -
its first NCAA Tournament berth
since 1998.
When Beilein first met with his
players in April 2007, he brought
the NCAA Sweet 16 and Elite Eight
rings he earned at West Virginia to
share. As each player slid the rings
on and off, Beilein's message was
clear:
"We're going to put these on
as soon as we can," Beilein said
through the Athletic Department
in 2007. "NCAA rings, we're going
to go after it as soon as we can.
There's no timetable. Just do your
best, and our coaching staff and
everyone will do the best they can,
as well."
That was 534 days ago. It has
been 11 years since Michigan's
last Tournament appearance. On
Thursday at 7:10 p.m., that will
change.
Yesterday, Michigan became a

Michigan coach John Beilein addresses the crowd at Crisler Arena yesterday before the NCAA Selection Show began.

legitimate Tournament team. And
Beilein deserves a lot of the credit.
HE'S BEEN EVERYWHERE
Thirty years of head coaching
experience speaks pretty loudly,
and 26 winning seasons is even
clearer.
Never as an assistant, Beilein has
learned how to win as a head coach
at all levels - community college,
NCAA Division II, and for the last
17 years, Division I.
In April 2007, after six seasons
under former-Michigan coach
Tommy Amaker and no NCAA
Tournament bids, Michigan Ath-
letic Director Bill Martin brought in
someone with a winner's resume.
Known as a true teacher, Beilein
directed his programs to greatness
with a quirky offensive system and
an ability to make seemingly aver-
age players into household names.
"John Beilein can win at what-
ever level you put him at and still
maintain the integrity of the insti-
tution and the integrity of his pro-
gram," said John Maddock, an
associate athletic director at Cani-
sius who served on the Canisius
search committee that helped hire
Beilein. "He finds a way. ... He's got
a track record that if you buy into
what he's selling, you're going to
win."
Beilein has sold his system well
with 10 postseason appearances.
But he also shows loyalty to his
players.
In 2006, Beilein's West Virginia
squad dropped its final regular-
season contest by three points to
Cincinnati on the road.
More than 400 miles away, in
Buffalo, N.Y., two of Beilein's for-
mer players, Michael Meeks and
Daryl Barley, were being induct-
ed into the Canisius Sports Hall
of Fame. Immediately after the
Mountaineers' game ended, Beilein
boarded a plane bound for Buffalo.
He made Meeks and Barley's after-
noon ceremony and then took the
two out for dinner. A few chicken
wings and another plane ride later,
he was back to Morgantown.
"That's why he's a special guy,"
Maddock said. "That's why he's so
successful and why players play
hard for him and people work for
him. He's extremely loyal, extreme-
ly passionate about what he does
and he cares about people."
In his six seasons, Amaker was
known as a class act. His integ-
rity and straight-laced recruiting
brought Michigan out of a dark
sanction period. He led the Wolver-
ines to two NIT Finals and won the
title in 2004.
But his teams could never quite
make it to the Big Dance.
"It was good with both guys,"
said assistant coach Mike Jackson,
who also worked under Amaker.
"But it's been really good to just
learn from someone who's won so
many games, done so many things
and been in this situation a lot of
times."

Beilein is now one of just seven
coaches to lead four different teams
to the NCAA Tournament.
He has done it with a variety
of players, some he recruited and
some he didn't. But before he even
conducted his first practice in Ann
Arbor, he needed to get Michigan's
best on board.
WINNING THEM OVER
Like he had done at his previous
stops, Beilein made a phone call
shortly after earning the head job.
DeShawn Sims had just finished
his freshman season. Sims came
in as a highly touted big man with
potential for a good outside shot,
but Amaker limited his playing
time.
Beilein was new coach and want-
ed the most from Sims.
Beilein called and Sims was all
ears.
"Ihadadelightful10-minutecon-
versation with him," Beilein said.
"And what I was most impressed
of ... I said, listen, we gotta address
this issue. Areyou in with this thing
as you get a new coach?
"And there was never any doubt
in his mind or my mind, showed no
wavering at all. 'Coach, I came to
Michigan to help turn the program
around.'And it was great chemistry
from the beginning."
In the Wolverines' marquee wins
this season - UCLA, Duke and Pur-
due - it was Sims who dominated
the stat sheets.
Since his freshman season, Sims
has blossomed as an agile post pres-
ence and crashed the boards as the
Big Ten's fourth-leading rebounder.
He can also hit outside shots with
some of the Wolverines' best sharp
shooters.
And as Sims jumped from his
chair as he heard Michigan's name
called yesterday as the South
Region's No. 10 seed, he had one
person to thank.
"Coach Beilein deserves 90 per-
cent of the credit," Sims said. "He's
done a great job of getting us to
believe. Believing has been lost in
Ann Arbor since probably the last
time we went to the Tournament
Once you teach people to believe,
it's very easy from there."
It's easy to believe now. Amaker
recruited players many thought
would return the program to great-
ness during his tenure. When Bei-
lein took the helm, he inherited
Amaker's highly touted recruiting
class. And Beilein had to make a
few more phone calls.
One was to Manny Harris.
Harris, Michigan's 2007 Mr.
Basketball, was set on becoming a
Wolverine.
When Amaker was fired, the
then-high school senior told report-
ers his plans were still intact. But
then his classmate Alex Legion
decommitted and Harris was faced
with a difficult decision.
"I told (Harris) that the reason
why he should stay is if he turns
that program around, which he's

doing now, and come back to the
Dance, put up'good numbers over
four years, he has a good chance
to go down as one of the greats,"
Ken Flowers, Harris's high school
coach, said.
In high school, Harris would
slash to the basket and draw fouls
with ease - not exactly a charac-
teristic of Beilein's previous sharp
shooters like Kevin Pittsnogle and
Joe Alexander.
"Beilein is more of jump shoot-
ing, and it really wasn't much of his
game," Flowers said of Harris. "But
working out this summer with me
and all year last year with Coach
Beilein, he really understands the
system right now and it's working."
Now, Harris still mesmerizes
with his drives but can also drain a
game-changing 3-pointer.
Within Beilein's system, Harris
has 93 more rebounds and 56 more
assists than at this point in his
freshman season.
Flowers said Harris has always
been very headstrong and com-
petitive, putting in extra effort
to improve. Harris has become a
complete player and is considered a
leader on his team.
"He came in and went straight to
business and didn't let up one bit on
me or my teammates," Harris said
of Beilein. "It was a lot himshowing
me the ropes. But I was able tontake
it - don't argue with him, don't
fight with him, and just want to get
better."
Harris and Sims wanted it, and
Beilein has shown them the way.
THE FUTURE
Beilein said he's going to enjoy
a cold beer and savor his team's
NCAA Tournament bid, but just for
one night.
It's not enough to have Michigan
simply make the Tournament. He
expects more.
"We had to get to this point to
have people believe," Beilein said.
"You know about recruiting, what
this does to people saying,'Are they
going to get it done there? Is that
style going to work, are those type
of recruits going to work, is this
going to work?'
"Okay, it worked so far ... now
we've got to continue with the pro-
gram so we can not just be happy
to be in, but to be in and advance,
which is obviously what we're try-
ing to do on Thursday."
Unlike Beilein's previous stops,
Michiganhas the namerecognition
to attract the country's top talent.
But Beilein has made a name for
himself by fitting players into his
system and maximizing their abil-
ity. Will he need top talent to grow
the program?
Beilein brought in freshmen
guards Stu Douglass and Zack
Novak this season. Two of the
team's best sharp shooters, the
duo has taken away playing time
from Amaker's original recruits
like sophomore point guard Kelvin

Second chance: 'M' stuns Duke

By RUTH LINCOLN
Daily Sports Editor
DECEMBER 8TH,2008 - As hun-
dreds of fans stormed the Crisler
Arena floor Saturday, Duke men's
basketball coach Mike Krzyzewski
walked off the court a loser for the
first time this season.
What did one of the most illus-
trious coaches in college basket-
ball think of Michigan's 81-73
upset over his fourth-ranked Blue
Devils, the Wolverines' first over
the storied program since 1997?
"They played harder than we
did," said Krzyzewski, who ranks
fifth among college basketball
coaches in all-time wins with 811.
"I'm not saying our kids didn't
want it, but (Michigan) really
played hard and well."
Krzyzewski hasn't had the
chance to say that about very many
teams. The Blue Devils handled
Michigan, 71-56, last month in the
the 2K Sports Classic, the game
after the Wolverines beat then-
No. 4 UCLA. Before this season,
few thought Michigan (6-2) would
manage to outplay an elite basket-
ball powerhouse, let alone two in a
single season.
With Saturday's victory, the
Wolverines defeated two top-five
teams in the regular season for the
first time since the 1986-87 sea-
son.
The game's unexpected out-
come could be epitomized by
3-point shots.
Duke made two in the first half.
Zack Novak made two in a
29-second span.
The freshman hit back-to-back
3-pointers with eight minutes left
and brought a roaring, sold-out
Crisler Arena crowd to its feet.
When last year's team may have
folded, Michigan responded with

poise. The Blue Devils (8-1) took a
three-point lead midway through
the second half, but Novak's two
triples vaulted the Wolverines to a
three-point lead of their own.
"It felt great," said Novak, who
didn't start, but finished with
14 points and went 4-for-7 from
behind the arc. "You get the crowd
into it a little bit - a momentum
swinger. I think that's my job -
come in, hit open shots."
Novak was one of four Wolver-
ines to tally nine or more points,
including sophomore small for-
ward Manny Harris who had 17.
But the game's standout was junior
power forward DeShawn Sims.
Before the matchup, Sims had
a message for his team about the
competition: "They're fast, but
they're not a Ferrari."
Sims echoed the confidence this
team has had since October. The
Detroit native led Michigan with
a career-high 28 points and tied
a career-high with 12 rebounds,
but his performance was part of a
team-wide effort to put the brakes
on Duke's speed.
From tipoff, Michigan kept
Duke from looking like a national
championship contender. The Wol-
verines outrebounded, outhustled
and outplayed the Blue Devils in
the end.
Duke never led by more than six
points, and the Wolverines held
their largest advantage, 10 points,
with fewer than 30 seconds to
play.
The Blue Devils didn't help their
cause by attempting a season-
high 33 3-pointers and connect-
ing on just seven. Duke's dismal
performance from behind the arc
allowed Michigan to successfully
fight for defensive rebounds and
run its transition offense.
"They're very difficult to score

Last year's run
was not a fluke

By RUTH LINCOLN
Daily Sports Writer
Are you a college basketball fan?
If you answered yes, you picked
the right time to come to Michigan.
For the first time in what seems
like an eternity, there's a buzz
surrounding the men's basketball
team. After an 11-year absence
from the NCAA Tournament, the
Wolverines went back to the Big
Dance last season. But they didn't
just arrive. They made a statement.
No. 10 Michigan carried out
the classic early-round upset
when it fought past No. 7 seed
Clemson, 62-59. But that tourna-
ment magic couldn't lift the Wol-
verines past No. 2 Oklahoma and
National Player of the Year, Blake
Griffin.
But don't be discouraged by last
year's second round tournament
exit. Last year's excitement could
be just thehbeginning.
Under head coach John Beil-
ein, now in his third season, the
Wolverines have climbed the
Tournament hump, and Michi-
gan basketball is relevant once
again.
Now it's not a question of if the
Wolverines can get back to the Big
Dance,buthow far can they go.And
behind junior Manny Harris and
senior DeShawn Sims, a return to
the tournament, and even a Sweet
16 or Elite Eight run, could be in
the works. Harris and Sims carried
the Wolverines much of last sea-
son. The duo accounted for more
than 48 percent of the Wolverines'

offensive output and 42 percent
of their total rebounds. They both
chose to forego leaving early and
declaring for the NBA Draft. If
they can lead the Wolverines deep
into the NCAA Tournament, they'll
receive the national attention that
could boost their draftstock.
But holding back the Wolver-
ines could be their supportingcast.
Last season, just Sims and Har-
ris averaged double digits. Now-
sophomore Zack Novak was the
team'sthird leading scorer with 6.7
points per game. But luckily, Novak
and his classmates Stu Douglass
and Laval Lucas-Perry are a year
older and should look like a more
experienced backcourt in Beilein's
3-point-oriented offense.
WHAT'S GONE?
The Wolverines were a young
team last year, but they had some
big leadership from two seniors
who weren't even taller than6-foot.
Losing last year's co-captains C.J.
Lee and David Merritt to gradua-
tion will definitely hurt in the lock-
er room. The outspoken duo was
knowntogivemotivatingpregame,
halftime and postgame speeches,
not to mention vocal contributions
on the court. Once, Merritt showed
the rousing halftime speech clip
from the film, "Any Given Sunday,"
to pump up his teammates.
But due to their absence, Michi-
gan will need someone to step up.
Look to Harris and Sims to do the
talking. For the first time in their
careers, they will both be expected
to be leaders on and off the court.

SA ID ALSALAH/Da ly
Sophomore Manny Harris and the Wolverines upset No. 4 Duke, the team's
second victory over a top-five opponent this season. Harris contributed 17 points,
five rebounds and two assists in the resume-boosting win. It was Michigan's first
victory over the Blue Devils since Dec. 13,1997, the same day former Michigan
football player Charles Woodson won the Heisman Trophy.

against in half court," Michigan
coach John Beilein said. "They
lock you up, make you go back
door, make you dribble-drive, and
we were a little better at that this
time than we were last time. ... Our
transition offense has been very
good to us this year, just like it's
one of Duke's fortes as well."
Sophomore point guard Kelvin
Grady took control in the second
half, matching the Blue Devils'

speed by finding open lanes and
teammates. He finished with a 4:0
assist-to-turnover ratio.
In the game's final minutes, he
hit 5-of-6 crucial free throws, part
of Michigan's 18-for-22 effort from
the charity stripe.
Following the game, Beilein said
he was "stuck for words."
Krzyzewski wasn't.
"They deserved the victory," he
said.

Wolverines knocked
out of College World
Series in third round
By MICHAEL FLOREK
DailySports Writer
JUNE 1ST, 2009 -
OKLAHOMA CITY - After its
most successful season in four
years, after coming from behind
in seven of its 17 conference
wins, one swing of the bat left the
Michigan's softball team's latest
comeback just short.
Down 6-3 heading into the
final three innings, Michigan ral-
lied back to cut the deficit to one.
An inning later, Georgia's Brian-
na Hesson sent a ball to right field
and assured Michigan would be
traveling back to Ann Arbor with-
out a second title, downing the
Wolverines, 7-5.
The Michigan team that gave
its program the first World Series
appearance since their magical
2005 national championship run
was eliminated..
"We got behind ... it's hard to

beat a team when you're down,"
Hutchins said. "Then we got right
back up ... We had a lot of well-hit
balls that didn't find their way,
and it's a different game if they
do. But I thought that our kids
battled back and that is all you
can ask for."
Michigan won its 13th Big Ten
title and made the program's
ninth World Series appearance.
For a team that jumped on its
opportunities all year, com-
ing from behind in seven of the
team's 17 conference wins, it was
their missed opportunity that
sent them back to Ann Arbor.
Down 6-5 in the sixth inning
senior Teddi Ewinghit aline drive
down the line with a runner on
first. Senior pinch runner Megan
Gregory tried to go from first to
third but was gunned down by
left fielder Megan Wiggins to end
the inning and the threat.
"I read the ball, I don't think I
even looked at Hutch," Gregory
said. "Do I wish I could take it
back for Teddi Ewing and for the
other teammates and my coach?
Yes, but I went for it ... They made

a great play on it and I can't take
it back."
Michigan had a glimmer of
hope in the seventh when a
ball hit by freshman Amanda
Chidester found its way to the
outfield grass. One hitter later,
junior Roya St. Clair hit a slow
grounder and it was all over.
Gregory is one of two seniors
who made her final appearance
in a Wolverine jersey tonight.
The other, Teddi Ewing, leaves a
hole at shortstop that hasn't been
there in four years.
"Unless you win the last game
you can never feel so good about
it," Hutchins said. "We have a lot
to reflect on, a lot to build on and
I'm really proud of our group this
year. I thought they were once of
the best softball team's I've ever
had."
Hutchins doesn't want to think
about next year yet. But with
eight-of-nine starters coming
back it is no doubt Michigan will
reload.
Whether they will have the
grit to get back to Oklahoma City
is vr eto he determined.

One word could be used to
describethe Michiganvolleyball
team this past year: resilient.
Midway through the season,
the Wolverines traveled to Illi-
nois and Purdue, where they lost
two heartbreaking, five-set
matches. Wins at both schools
could have propelled the team
third or fourth-place in the Big
Ten instead of its eventual fifth-
place finish.
But the Wolverines didn't
let the losses shake their con-

fidence. After the two road
defeats, Michigan finished Big
Ten play with a 6-2 record, led
by sophomore setter Lexi Zim-
merman. The Barrington, Ill.
native was the main architect
of the highly potent Michigan
offensive attack.
She helped the Wolverines
finish ranked 17th in the sea-
son's final poll-their highest
ranking of the season. The team
advanced to the Sweet 16 of the
NCAA Tournament where it

was swept by Nebraska in three
sets.
With the team losing seniors
Beth Karpiak and Kerry Hance,
Michigan coach Mark Rosen
will look to sophomore libero
Sloane Donhoff and senior hit-
ters Megan Bower and Juliana
Paz next season. The trio will
need to elevate its play if the
Wolverines want to contend
with Big Ten powerhouses Penn
State, Illinois and Purdue.

Daily Sports Editor
MARCH 29TH,2009 -
BRIDGEPORT, Conn. - One
by one, members of the Michigan
hockeyteam filed out of the locker
room, their faces blank and emo-
tionless.
The team was shell-shocked.
After Friday's 2-0 loss to Air Force
in the first round of the NCAA
Tournament, the Wolverines
didn't immediately seem to grasp
the concept of a season-ending
defeat.
But the Falcons certainlyunder-
stood the idea of an underdog vic-
tory, their first tournament win
in program history. As the final
buzzer sounded, they stormed
onto the ice toward junior goalie
Andrew Volkening, who had just
posted his third straight shutout.
And Michigan's fourth shutout
loss of the season encapsulated
many aspects of its up-and-down
year.
The inconsistent play of sopho-
more goalie Bryan Hogan was at
the forefront. He had been solid
throughout most of the season, but
he collapsed against Notre Dame
in a 5-2 CCHA Tournament cham-
pionship loss on March 21. In the
Wolverines' final 97:50 of play this
year, Hogan gave up seven goals -
while his teammates couldn't find
the back of the net once.
Like in Friday's contest, the
team struggled to find constant

sources of offense all season.
Multi-line scoring was the Wol-
verines' mantra, and it worked
for a while. They even found suc-
cess for two periods against Notre
Dame last weekend - their two-
goal lead came from their first and
fourth lines.
But despite outshooting Air
Force by 30 shots Friday, Michi-
gan came up empty. It tallied 43
shots on Volkening. It dominated
time of possession, even posting
a stretch of almost four minutes
wherethe puckdidn'tleavetheAir
Force zone. Friday's game marked
the sixth time this season in which
Michigan outshot its opponent but
lost the game.
The Wolverines demonstrated
the speed, skills and playmaking
ability to win the game, but their
luck ran out against a white-hot
goaltender.
"We got 40-some shots, we
probablyhadl0orl2Grade-Ascor-
ing chances," Michigan coach Red
Berenson said. "That's the most
you're going to get in any game.
We didn't capitalize on them.
Then their goalie played a terrific
game. It's as simple as that.
"Somebody told me a long time
ago, when you get to this tourna-
ment, the team with the best goal-
ie wins."
His team echoed many of his
sentiments after the season-end-
ing defeat.
Sophomore forward Aaron
Palushaj said it was quite apparent

that the Wolverines outplayed Air
Force - the bounces just didn'tgo
their way.
Sophomore forward Matt Rust
said he and his teammates had
enough scoring chances to win the
game, but running into a hot goalie
made the task nearly impossible.
Junior co-captain Chris Sum-
mers, who usually cracks light-
hearted jokes atpress conferences,
gave short, one-word answers to
reporters after Friday's game.
When asked how he felt following
the loss, Summers simply glow-
ered. His deadly glare seemed to
showcase a variety of emotions -
from anger to disappointment to
sadness.
And there's no doubt that, on
paper, the losswas shocking. A No.
4 seed knocked off a No.1 seed.Air
Force, ateam thathad neverwon a
tournament game, beat Michigan,
a team with nine NCAA Champi-
onship titles.
It would have been easy for the
Wolverines to overlook the lowly
Falcons. It would have been easy
for them to chalk it up as a crazy
upset. But for Berenson, it was
neither. He stood firm, stating
repeatedly that his team had been
well-prepared.
"We expected a tough game, so
this wasn't an upset," Berenson
said. "This was a real good Air
Force team. ... I can tell you, (my)
team did not look ahead. We put
everything we had into this game,
and the puck just didn't go in."

Baseball season ends sans a
Big Ten Tournament berth

By CHANTEL JENNINGS
Daily Sports Editor
MAY 17TH, 2009 -
Senior pitcher Chris Fetter felt
his season end before it was actu-
ally over.
The Wolverines had just
allowed the Wildcats to score six
uncontested runs during the fifth
and sixth innings. The Wolver-
ines' lead deteriorated into a 10-6
deficit.
Then, after the sixth inning
as Michigan (9-15 Big Ten, 30-25
overall) was headed back to the
dugout in hopes of a comeback, a
voice came over the loudspeaker
announcingthat Purdue was com-
fortably leading Illinois 8-1 going
into the sixth inning.
Fetter's heart sank. The dugout
went silent. Michigan baseball
coach Rich Maloney said nothing.
A Boilermaker victory meant there
would be no Big Ten Tournament
run, no four-peat as conference
champions, no trip to Columbus.

And, as Fetter had expected,
Purdue went on to beat the Fight-
ing Illini, 12-8.
Still, the Wolverines had to fin-
ish Saturday's doubleheader, end-
ing in 10-6 and 6-5 losses.
Only 24 hours before, these
games had meant everything to
the Wolverines, but after learn-
ing of their postseason fate, they
would only serve as examples of
Michigan's disappointing season
record.
"It was pretty hard for all of us
because we've never really played
a game where it didn't mean any-
thing," Fetter said. "That was hard
to sit there and watch that game
andknowthatitdidn'treallycount
towards anything."
Fetter had done all he could on
Thursday night during the first
game of the series. After pitch-
ing three scoreless innings, Fetter
allowed six runs during the fourth
inning. But Fetter and freshman
Brandon Sinnery were able to keep
the Wildcats silent after that as the
Wolverines used a nine-run sev-
enth inningto claim the firstgame
of the series, 16-6.
At the plate, junior Mike Dufek
led the offensive attack, going
2-for-4 with two home runs and
four RBI. Junior Alan Oaks helped
to lighten the load, batting 2-for-4
with three RBI, despite North-
western's best efforts to slow the
scoring surge with three pitchers
in the seventh.
A rainout on Friday turned Sat-
urday's game into a doublehead-
er while Purdue dropped their
middle game 6-3 to Illinois. The
Boilermakers' loss gave Michigan
hope. If Purdue lost again on Sat-
urday and Michigan swept North-
western (5-17,14-35), the sixth spot
in the Big Ten Tournament would
have the Wolverines' name on it.
But Purdue finished with a win,
and Michigan saw their season
come to an unfamiliar halt.
For the past three seasons, the
Wolverines hoisted the Big Ten
Tournament title trophy, but this
year they came two wins short of
a postseason berth.
Those two wins seemed some-

what hefty for ateam that went 1-2
in every Big Ten series except for
Iowa.
"It's hard not to look back on
those times and think 'What if?'
or 'What could have been?"' Fetter
said. "Maybe if we could have won
a few of those games, got on a roll,
been right there on the top, com-
peting for a Big Ten Champion-
ship, our season could have been
completely different."
Senior Kenny Fellows made the
most of his last outing in a Michi-
gan uniform, batting 4-for-9
with three RBI. Freshman John
Lorenz stepped up in the second
game of the doubleheader and
went 3-for-4 with one run and
two RBI.
But the few bright spots over
the weekend did little to override
the blemish of Michigan's absence
in the Big Ten Tournament.
"I think the weekend in gen-
eral was kind of representative
of the rest of our season," Fellows
said. "We made a lot of mistakes
that we've been making all sea-
son. We didn't really step up in
the moments."
And on Saturday, Fetter
watched from the dugout as the
Wolverines two losses seemed to
be a reflection on his last season
as well.
"Usually we had one or two fac-
ets of our game - hitting, pitching
or fielding," Fetter said. "But we
just couldn't put all three together
at the same time. That holds true
throughout the whole season. We
were never able to put everything
together."
Now the Wolverines will
head back to work and try to put
together all facets of their game
for the 2010 campaign. But the
offseason will be long and the tro-
phy case lonely without the Big
Ten four-peat.
"We will leave no stone
unturned and work hard to get
back to where we need tobe next
season," Maloney said. "I think
that this feeling we have as we
walk out of here today is some-
thing that will drive our return-
ing players."

DesignatingaNo.t quarterbackfrom
day one will help with team attitude
and consistency. Rodriguez's on-the-
field problems will be the easiest
to fix because this year's freshmen
will be sophomores, and that year of
experience could be the difference in
next season's close games.
POSTGAME
Losing is unacceptable, but a
fragmented team is intolerable.
There had been hints of it all sea-
son, but the careful display of team
unity the Wolverines tried to pre-
serve all season finally crumbled
Saturday.
It had been starting to publicly
unravel for a few weeks before-
hand, when Rodriguez announced
last week that Zion Babb and Jason
Kates were no longer on the team.
Others will certainly follow, includ-
ing the still-unannounced but likely
departure of sophomore safety Artis
Chambers.
Upperclassmen David Moosman
and Terrance Taylor have both said
more than once in the last few weeks
that some of their teammates don't
always understand the importance
of playing hard.
"Some people in the shadows that
maybe have different agendas, we're
weeding those people out," Moos-

man said lastMonday.
But it wasn't until Satorday that
the team's disconnect became glar-
ingly, embarrassingly clear, starting
with senior Charles Stewart's fight
with the coaching staff in the first
quarter and ending with Brandon
Minor stopping just short of calling
his teammates out by name after the
loss.
"It's like some people don't even
like leaving theirself when they step
on the field," Minor said. "Can't
really blame Rich Rod because
everybody on the team didn't buy in
like they were supposed to."
Going into next season, Rodri-
guez's first priority needs to be
getting his team to act like a team
again. He has said he wishes he
got to know his players better on a
personal level, and starting now, he
should make sure he does that.
In the end, Rodriguez said he
hopes this 2008 season will be
remembered as a "blip on the radar."
With all the notoriety it has gained,
that's doubtful.
Tying a program-record, five-
game losing streak within a season.
Five more average points per
game allowed this season than the
previous worst Michigan defense.
Five more losses than the Wol-
verines had last season.
That just means five months from
now, with spring practice done and
the start of seasontwo in the transi-
tion looming, the Wolverines' prog-
ress needs to be obvious.

TOP TEN HEADLINES OF 2009-2010

"Will Michigan wake up from its 3-9 nightmare?"- After the
team's worst performance in school history, the Wolverine
faithful have hope, at least for the Motor City Bowl.
"Is the basketball team sweet enough for the Sweet 16"- After a
great second year under John Beilein, Michigan looks to avenge
last year's second round loss with nearly everyone returning.
"Should RichRod use the Force?"- With one of the worst QB
performance's in recent school history, will coach Rodriguez
opt for true freshman standout Tate Forcier under center?
"Who totes the rock?" - With team leader C:J. Lee lost to gradua-
tion and Kelvin Grady in football pads, the basketball team has a
hole at point guard. Is it freshman Darius Morris' spot to lose?
"Can Hutch bring home another Title?"- Softball endured a
tough loss in the College World Series, but with nearly every-
one back, can it replicate its '05 Championship season?

"Goalie Tendencies"- Michigan goalies dominate the regular
season but just can't get it done when it counts. Will this year
be different with Bryan Hogan between the pipes all season?
"Quick to judge"- Will new defensive coordinator Greg Robin-
son's "quick" position on defense make a difference? And who's
going to be Robinson's first hybrid guinea pig?
"Running away with a legacy"- Tiffany Ofili may have been one
of the best athletes in Michigan sports history with five national
championships. How does the track team replace a legend?
"Pryor-itizing"- After the Terrelle Pryor recruiting debachle,
RichRod is aiming at another Rivals No. 1 recruit - Seantrel
Henderson. Can Michigan sign the OL cornerstone it needs?
"King of his court"- Michigan tennis welcomes the nation's No.
1 recruit - Evan King - to Ann Arbor. Can King change the Big
Ten landscape that has been Buckeye-dominated for so long?

WILL MOELLER/Daily
Michigan coach John Beilein at the NCAA selection ceremony held at Crisler Arena
on Sunday March 15, 2009. Michigan was selected as the No.10 seed.

BEILEIN

Grady, redshirt sophomore for-
ward Anthony Wright and senior
forward Jevohn Shepherd.
But the Wolverines have stayed
together.
"What Ilove about this program
is that is a unified team," Mar-
tin said. "There are not factions
among that team, it's all about the
team. There's not, 'I'm not going
to pass it to that guy because I
don't like him,' It is not that at all.
It's a very cohesive team. Again,
that's a reflection of the leadership
through the coaching staff."
After a 10-22 season in his inau-
gural year in Ann Arbor, Beilein
faced many doubters.
Could his system survive the Big
Ten? Would he recruit better play-
ers or just ones to fit his system?
MINOR
From Page 4E
NO REGARD FOR HIS
OPPONENTS
Redshirt sophomore left guard
John Ferrara remembered watch-
ing an Illinois player lie on the
ground after a kickoff late in the
Wolverines' 45-20 loss Oct. 4. He
didn't see what happened on the
play, but he was told Minor deliv-
ered the big hit.
"I wasn't really that surprised
because I know hard he comes all
the time," Ferrara said.
It doesn't matter if it's on spe-
cial teams late in a blowout game
or in practice - Minor plays hard.
"He just really gets after it,"
said Ferrara, who played defen-
sive tackle before this year. "He'll
come downhill and he'll really put
his face on you. A lot of running
backs will try and juke out of the
way.
But there's times he'll go jack
someone hard enough to knock
him out."

And could he lead Michigan to its
first NCAA berth since 1998?
"Naw, I didn't," Jackson said
when asked if he thought Michi-
gan would make the Tournament
this season. "I think we set goals
from the very beginning about
where we wanted to be. And we've
taken one of those steps today."
Michigan is starting to follow
the same path as Beilein's previ-
ous teams: struggling to learn his
system in the first year, bouncing
back in the second and build a
winning tradition.
"When you're 10-22, you're not
expecting (the NCAA Tourna-
ment)," Beilein said.
"I said it would bea roller coast-
er.... I'm not trying totell anybody
I'm wiser than anybody else, but
experience tells you you're going
to be up and down."
And to be up in the middle of
March is pretty good.
Minor runs with a passion that
makes it seem like he's trying to
use each step to stomp out any
doubts anyone might have had
earlier this season.
Minor has eight rushing eight
touchdowns on 89 carries this
year, a pace of a touchdown every
11.125 carries. Tom Harmon is the
only Michigan season-rushing
leader to run for scores more fre-
quently, notching a touchdown
every 10 runs in 1939.
NO REGARD FOR HIS
TEAMMATES
Minor is one of Michigan's big-
gest trash talkers, and he doesn't
bring generic insults, either.
"I'll talk about them personally
- stuff they're sensitive about,"
Minor.
Does anybody ever take it the
wrong way?
"Sometimes, they probably do,"
Minor said. "But that's what we
need on the field."
It doesn't matter if it's on spe-
cial teams late in a blowout game
or in yractice - Minor plays hard.

Angelo's Restaurant, located
on the corner of Glen Avenue and
Catherine Street, has been an Ann
Arbor staple since 1956. Angelo
Vangelatos and his wife Patricia
Verames opened the business a few
years after Angelo arrived from
Greece, and the restaurant has
been bustling ever since. Angelo
and Patricia's son Steve and his
wife Jennifer run the eatery these
days, and they are determined to
keep the restaurant running the
way it was originally run.
Angelo's breakfast is so great
it inspired a famous song by Dick
Siegel. The song is played when
restaurant's website loads, and
patrons can purchase the album
itself at the restaurant's cash register.

"Eggs over easy, hash browns
and toast" is what Dick chose
to order, but you'll find plenty of
other tummy-pleasing options
there as well.
The restaurant offers classics
from French toast and scrambled
eggs to more elaborate dishes
like Crabby Benedict and pump-
kin pancakes. The wide variety
of food ensures that everybody
will find something to his or her
liking. The assortment is a big
reason Angelo's has won Best
Breakfast in Ann Arbor not only
this year, but several times in the
past. And with its devoted follow-
ing that spans generations, it's
obvious Angelo's is a mainstay in
Ann Arbor.

And what if you're on the run?
Desperately need caffeine and a
quick breakfast? Stop into Ange-
lo's on the Side, a small coffee
house/carry outbuilding attached
to the restaurant. Grab a cappuc-
cino, a pastry or your favorite
meal in a convenient doggie bag.
Angelo's on the Side is also a great
place to pick up Angelo's famous
homemade raisin bread.
Be reminded, however, that if
you're planning to visit Angelo's
foratasty andtraditionalsit-down
breakfast, pack your patience.
The place is often packed by Ann
Arborites and the line to get into
the popular eatery is often out the
door and around the corner.

SPOTLIGHT ON: ASH LEY'S

I don't really have to tell you this,
because in your heart you already
knowit:Ashley'siswhatabarissup-
posed tobe. At Ashley's, patrons can
find the finest of drinks, the closest
of friends and - the deal-breaker
- the most perfect of atmospheres.
The heavenly joint's honey-brown
and milk-chocolaty hues, weath-
ered brick walling and hazy lights
all blanket guests in a fuzzy, wel-
coming warmth, mercifully provid-
ing short respite from a seemingly
otherwise unforgiving, cold world
outside. This is your place.
Somewhere, lost in the threads
of our progressively deteriorat-
ing American culture, drinking
has been reduced to an oft-repeat-
ed machismo parade of pushing
through packed houses filled with
blaring music in order to knock back

a shot. Silly freshmen, drinking'snot
for kids. Beers need to be nursed,
loved and cradled, and for god's
sake, there should be some bloody
conversation while you're sipping
your brew. This, after all, is the sport
of pub drinking, and within this
sport, Ashley's is Wrigley Field.
Ashley's tabletops, graced with
the carved signatures of patrons
who have come before you, now
serve as a resting place for your best
friends'elbows.With your friends in
close proximity, conversation - that
lovely thing that goes hand-in-hand
with alcoholic beverages - natural-
ly happens. Maybe this is the reason
Ashley's, Ann Arbor's bar of bars, is
considered sacred ground.
Ashley's, though, is not endeared
by Ann Arborites and University
students alike solely because of its

homey environment. At Ashley's,
beers flow magically from seem-
ingly infinite taps. Aside from the
70 draughtbeers normally available
(including rare beers that can't be
found anywhere else in Michigan,
like Schneider Aventinus, a wheat
ale from Kelheim, Germany), there's
a rotating tap that brings limited
specialty brews to the lips of those
residing in Ann Arbor. Simply put,
Ashley's'selection is unparalleled.
The formula, the one that has
made it so renowned, is simple:
provide people with a good place
to drink good beers. While other
establishments might have lostsight
what makes a bar truly a bar, Ash-
ley's embraces these essential bare-
bones principles. And that's why we
embrace Ashley's.

If you struggle with indeci-
sion, stay away from Stucchi's. An
Ann Arbor original, Stucchi's has
almost too many incredibly deli-
cious flavors. Ranging from the
sinful White Russian Fudge to the
quirky PB Truffle Shuffle (along
with ever-pleasing classics like
Strawberry and French Vanilla),
there is always a flavor to suit any
mood.
In case caloric morals inter-
fere, Stucchi's also offers frozen
yogurts of which the variety is
just as expansive (Swiss Choco-
late Almond, anyone?), so sacri-

ficing taste is never a concern.
Milkshakes, smoothies, sorbet and
soft-serve ice cream are also avail-
able, catering to cravings of every
dessert domain. Just to top it all
off, Stucchi's now offers Insomnia
Cookies, making the menu so irre-
sistible and arousing it's almost
unsafe to read when young chil-
dren are nearby.
True dessert connoisseurs
will never run out of selections,
which is probably for the best
since choosing a favorite flavor or
combination is nearly impossible.
Luckily, you can always try plenty

of free samples to decipher your
own personal perfect combination.
Choosing a location isn't a concern,
either, since there are multiple
stores on campus. Stucchi's is that
best friend on gray days, or after
a break-up or when you've failed
an exam. Supplied with caramel,
chocolate, fresh fruit, nuts and
homemade chocolate-dipped waf-
fle cones, it's always there to ease
away any troubles.
Still not convinced? Then we'll
use this age-old argument: Buy
local.

Good No Thai! customers are

D MOCH/Daily scoff pretentiously at those they
overhear pondering what a restau-
rant called No Thai! would serve
coffee, you ("Why would a restaurant make a
e horde, of point of telling people what they
masse to don't serve?"). They smile to them-
selves when novice customers
sday after contemplate the meaning of the
lattes. The question mark following "medi-
apathetic um" on the menu's list of spice lev-
eat of your els. (Though to be fair, "medium?"
each vari- isn't the best assessment of the
nes like an spiciness it stands for.)
o usurper, The whimsicality of No Thai!'s
ger. Your misnomer, casual use of punctua-
tion and foreign cuisine make it
WAGONER the perfect place to grab a deli-

ciously filling meal while feeling
totally indifferent about how hip-
ster, indie, scene, urban or bohe-
mian you look (or whatever else
you youngsters are currently striv-
ing to be these days).
For those who claim they judge
restaurants based on food quality
and aren't concerned with their
image: You're not fooling anyone.
In all seriousness, though, two
remarkable qualities of No Thai!
cuisine keep customers satisfied
and ensure return visits.
First, No Thai!'s food smells
almost better than it tastes, and it
tastes great. If you're low on cash,
you can get roughly the same sat-
isfaction from standing outside
the restaurant and enjoyingexotic

scents as you can from actually
indulging in its flavorful dishes.
But No Thai's best achievement
lies is its ability to create meals that
survive collegiate conditions. Sur-
prisingly, the week-old No Thai!
leftovers lying in your refrigera-
tor will taste just as good after two
minutes in the microwave. Thank
goodness for large portions, take-
out boxes and those newfangled
radiation machines.
More hip than Jimmy John's,

SPOTLIGHT ON: PZZA HOUSE

According to its website, Pizza
House is "A Slice of Chicago, in
your home town!!!" Making the
literal interpretation of that state-
ment a reality would require the
newest laser-drilling technology,
thecooperation ofmillionsofpeo-
ple, hundreds of billions of dollars
and a ton of helicopters (and once
we airlifted the slice of city over
here, we wouldn't even have a
good place to put it). Luckily for
us, it turns out Pizza House was
actually using a form of metony-
my and referring to Chicago-style
pizza (who knew?), which is not
only far easier to accomplish, but
also much more delicious.
Pizza House is a great place to

go for some deep-dish delights.
Located conveniently on Church
Street between South University
and Willard Street, it's never a far
walk - unless you live on North
Campus, in which case you have
my deepest condolences. But
never fear, neighbors to the north,
for Pizza House delivers until the
miraculous hour of 4 a.m., setting
it apart from the competition. So
whether you live in EastQuad and
are too lazy to cross the street to
satisfy your late night munchies
or you're being held as a hungry
hostage on North Campus by the
tyrannous bus schedule, Pizza
House will bring a saucy solution
straight to your door.

There are some who think
Pizza House is overpriced, and
to be fair, it is kind of expensive. I
believe it was Winston Churchill
who once said "responsibility
is the price of greatness." But at
Pizza House, the price of great-
ness starts at around $10.99.
As far as the pizza itself goes,
Pizza House does a pretty damn
good job emulating the city of
Chicago's success on the pizza
front. And it smells and looks as
good as it tastes. Whether you
go deep-dish or not, your taste
buds, nostrils and retinae will all
leave happy - even if your wallet
doesn't.

SPOTLIGHT ON: MICHIGAN THEATRE

If you don't know the Michi-
gan Theater is the best theater
in Ann Arbor, then you really
need to get out more. Between
concerts, lecture series, popu-
lar films, independent films
and screenings of classic films,
the Michigan Theater can meet
everyone's entertainment needs.
And if entertainment isn't your
thing, the theater's architec-
tural beauty alone makes it one
of Ann Arbor's best establish-
ments. If you ever go to an event
there, stay until the lights come
on and turn your attention away
SPOTLIGHT ON: BORD
Borders has been in Ann Arbor
since the '70s. It's a local busi-
ness - it was piloted here, in case
you've been living in a box. And
even with plummeting profits and
bankruptcy, the Liberty Street's
Borders hasmanaged to keep some
awesome programs running.
Borders makes a point of bring-
ing in artists - both emerging
and well-established - for free
concerts. Last year, artists includ-
ing Matt Nathanson. visited, and

ceiling. If you're not impressed,
well, you're a loser.
If nothing else, the Michigan
Theater has refreshments down
pat. The popcorn alone is worth
the visit, and with free refills
on the large bucket, it's a party
all movie long. And speaking of
partying, a club membership is a
must for frequent theater goers.
I mean, come on, you can drink
beer while watching a movie.
All the cool kids are doing it.
The Michigan Theater would
be the best in alot of cities other

though it might now be a chain, it
maintains its indie-flavored pres-
ence in Ann Arbor as a local busi-
ness just as Shaman Drum does.
What makes it the best book-
store in Ann Arbor? For one thing,
it's by far the largest. While itmay
not afford the cozy bookshop feel
some bibliophiles yearn for, its
proportions allowit to incorporate
a expansive selection of books, a
sizable music section and a qual-
ity coffee shop (complete with, of
course, comfortable seating and
study spaces).
The employees are great.What-
ever section you might be looking
in, they have a recommendation.

than Ann Arbor, but let's be
frank - it doesn't have much
competition here. The Quality
16 serves a purpose, no doubt,
but it doesn't have the histori-
cal background or aesthetics
to rival the Michigan Theater.
And though the State Theater
has that nostalgic Ann Arbor
feel, it just isn't as well-round-
ed as its counterpart down the
street. No matter how you cut
it, the Michigan Theater is Ann
Arbor's best.
+ -ZACHARY MEISNER

Some are listed on the book-
shelves as "staff picks," but more
than that, the staff actually knows
what's good - and they aren'tonly
familiar with headliners.
So although it might not be the
place to go for all your textbook
needs, if you ever want to browse
or just pick up that book your
roommate said was amazing, Bor-
ders is your place. Not only will it
have that ridiculously awesome
book, but you'll probably encoun-
ter another couple great finds on
your way out. Not great for the
pocketbook, but perfect for the
book lover.

said that the city's size is not a

"If there's one thing Ican say, as

But even with the most expensive

day from 8 p.m. to 2 a.m.
"At first it was our intention to
go every day of the week but we
found out that it was harder to get
started during the day than during
the night," he said. The nightlife is
more accepting of it."
In addition, Galinis acknowl-
edged the fact that weather during
the winter months can make for
uncomfortable conditions outside,
but that business is just about as
busy now as it is during summer
months.
"The one thing that definitely
stops us is the wind," he said. "It's
just unsafe."
Even last Friday - when tem-
peratures were near 22 degrees
- Galinis said he made as much
money as he would have on an aver-
age summer night with perfect
weather.
And in regards to competition
with taxi cabs, Galinis said he
knows it's there, but thinks that
time will mend any ill feelings after
cab drivers realize that it's a give-
and-take relationship.
Although the pedicabs business
takes away some shorter rides from
taxicabs, Galinis said he also refers
longer distance rides to cab driv-
ers.
"I think it just needs time," said
Galinis.

for another hit

Go On a Diet: Eat Lo-cal

By VALIANT LOWITZ
Daily StaffReporter
APRIL 5TH, 2009 - High noon
on the first Saturday in April
means only one thing: Hash
Bash.
A smoky haze filled Monroe
Street Saturday, as a mixture of
old-time activists, University stu-
dents, adult spectators and mari-
juana enthusiasts came together
to support recreational marijuana
use, oppose United States drug
laws and enjoy an afternoon in
the sun.
And this year, the mood was
a little more celebratory than
usual.
In its 37th year, Hash Bash had
a significantreform to commemo-
rate: the legalization of medical
marijuana in the state of Michi-
gan.
Proposal 1, which was passed
by 63 percent of Michigan vot-
ers last November, legalized the

possession of medical marijuana
within the state for those with a
doctor's recommendation. The
law took effect Saturday, the
same day as the festivities.
Andrew Kent, president of
the University's chapter of the
National Organization for the
Reform of Marijuana Laws - the
event's primary organizer - said
this year's event attracted more
students than he had ever seen
during his three years at the Uni-
versity.
Between 1,500 and 1,600 peo-
ple gathered on the Diag for the
first half of the event according to
Diane Brown, a spokeswoman for
the Department of Public Safety.
In 2006, an estimated 900 people
turned out for the event, accord-
ing to The Michigan Daily.
Kent attributed the increased
turnout to wider acceptance of
recreational drug use both on
campus and across the country.
"I think that drug use is becom-

ing much more normalized in our
society," Kent said. "People don't
really look down on you in the
same way anymore."
After the gathering on the Diag,
supporters marched together to
the annual Monroe Street Fair.
The fair featured live music blar-
ing from a stage in front of Domin-
ick's and numerous streetvendors
selling everything from marijua-
na paraphernalia to T-shirts.
The annual event began in
response to a March 9,1972 Mich-
igan Supreme Court decision that
declared unconstitutional the
drug law used to convict activist
John Sinclair for possession of
two marijuana joints.
That decision left the state of
Michigan without laws prohib-
iting the use of marijuana for
almost a month until a law was
passed on Apr. 1, 1972.
Hash Bash is held every year on
the first Saturday in April to com-
memorate the decision.

FEBRUARY 12TH, 2009 - As
the economic crisis continues, our
nation is strugglingto turn around
its money, fate and fortune. Pro-
ceeding hand-in-hand with our
economic restructuring has been
the call to "Buy American" and
even to mandate it as a part of the
economic stimulus plan.
The call to buy American makes
some people anxious, both the
free-trade crowd here and our
foreign suppliers. This week's
cover of The Economist magazine
melodramatically expressed those
fears. Trade protectionism is per-
sonified as a reanimated corpse
with a horror flick title across the
top that reads, "The Return of
Economic Nationalism."
Despite the stir, buying Ameri-
can holds a lot of power right now.
And not just on the national level:
Governor Jennifer Granholm's
latest State of the State address
featured Michigan labor as an
essential part of the state's plan.
According to Granholm, "instead
of spending nearly $2 billion a year
importing coal or natural gas from
other states, we'll be spending our
energy dollars on Michigan wind

We need to make a similar effort
to buy American on a local level.
Regardless of our differences when
it comes to international trade pol-
icy, we can agree on what we want
our city's economy to look like.
All of us benefit from the small

businesses thatstitchtogetherAnn
Arbor's economy. Because of the
little restaurants and bookstores
that make this place so unique, the
University is able to attract some
of the most progressive minds in
the world. This is a symbiotic, even
chicken-and-egg relationship; it's
tough to say which boomed first.

- and in these hard times, that is
completely understandable. Sha-
man Drum owner Karl Pohrt took
pre-emptive measures to prepare
for the blow. He applied Shaman
Drum for nonprofit status in an
attempt to embrace our commu-
nity and Shaman Drum's role in it.
Students cannot become inves-
tors in our local icons, but our
actions en masse are just as influ-
ential. We truly are voting with
our dollars when we spend them.
In this vein, I want to write a cam-
paign ad for our community.
Shaman Drum has books you'll
never find ina chain store because
Pohrt and his staff cater to our
community. To really look at the
shelves is to take the city's pulse.
They'll even have the esoteric
book your professor suggested you

read.
When I heard that Shaman
Drum might be having tough
times, the first thingI did was pick
up some books there. It's an empty
gesture, unless you do it too. Times
are hard for everyone right now
and we have to stick together.
But we're not just talking about
bookstores here. When you go out
to eat, forget the sandwich chains
that have elbowed their way onto
State Street (aren't as affected
franchises if the rent is too high).
Go say hi to Sava or Silvio instead.
Forget seeing "My Bloody
Valentine" in 3D. Check out the
Michigan or State Theater instead.
Whenyou choosetobuylocal,your
lifestyle will change for the better.
Sure, we need our food to be
cheap if we're going to eat out at
all. I'd just like to let the $5 sand-
wich crowd know that they can get
a pound of Indian food at the same
price.Youjust have to know where
to look. For those in a hurry, snag a
chicken shawarma pita.
Everything local has an unfair
reputation for being expensive.
I work at Caf6 Ambrosia, and we
have the cheapest cup of coffee
in Ann Arbor. Working there only
convinces me that people like that
local familiarity. Most of our cus-
tomers come in every day.

haven't been before. My next stop?

Street.

Promoting protection
on campus
If you've ever walked down
South University Avenue, it's likely
that you've seen the Safe Sex Store.
Although its neon sign has become
a common stop for scavenger hunt
participants, S3 Safe Sex Store has
a lot more to offer than outlandish
novelties for sexual pleasure.
According to the store's website,
owner BethAnn Karmeisool was
inspired to start the business after
volunteering for children infected
with the AIDS virus through the
Rainbow Connection, a Michigan

non-profit organization that works
with children with life-threatening
illnesses. The purpose of the store is
to provide correct, consistent, sexual
health information.
Safe sex educator and retail clerk
Jeannie Hahl aims to deliver this
message and offer her "big sister"
help.
"While going to college, there are
so many opportunities for sexual
experimentation," she said.
Hahl said the information avail-
able to students about sexual oppor-
tunities doesn't always come from
reliable sources. And that's where S3
comes in.
"There's a resource like this
around that tells you what condom
is most reliable," Hahl said as an
example.
In addition to educating the stu-
dent body about sexual health and
helping to stop the spread of sexual
diseases, S3 has other objectives.
"The store is also very female-
centered," Hahl said. "We want to
empower women with sexual infor-
mation rather than repressing them.
We want to make them confident."
In fact, Hahl said S3's best selling

product is the "silicone-based, super
female friendly 'ID Millennium'
lube."
Hahl is aware that many people
are intimated to cross the threshold
from the sidewalk of South Univer-
sity to the store, but she offers kind
words of encouragement to ease
their trepidation.
"I usually say, 'We're nice in here,
you don't have to be afraid!"'she said.
"The staff is so warm and inviting.
It's not scary, it's actually just a cute
store."

Insomnia cookies feed
hungry students
For someone who works between
8:00 p.m. and 2:30 a.m. every night,
Kevin Lemon seems like a pretty
chipper guy. Lemon works as the
assistant manager of the Insomnia
Cookies store, doling out cookies to
hungry University students from his
conveniently parked cookie truck.
Given the store's odd hours,
Lemon says it draws a "colorful"
clientele, on both the weekdays and
weekends alike.
"It really doesn't seemlike people


discriminate a whole lot," Lemon
said. "You getsome stumbley people
any night of the week."
Lemon has operated the Insom-
nia cookie truck in Ann Arbor for a
month, and so far, he said working
third shift is the only drawback of
the job. He said the cookies he bakes
on a nightly basis have also lostsome
of their appeal.
"They're not as good as they used
to be," Lemon said. "If I eat more
than two a night, that's not good. I
try not to come to work hungry."
Though some students are will-
ing to trek across campus in the

name of snickerdoodle and choco-
late chip cookies, Lemon said that
as of now, Insomnia cookies isn't
allowed to sell baked goods on Uni-
versity property. He added, howev-
er, that an agreement is the works to
change that.
Regardlessofhislocation,though,
since he hascome to campus, Lemon
has helped satisfy students' cravings
on their way to the library or head-
ing home from the bar.
"I mean, how often do you have
the time to bake them yourself?"
Lemon said.

It's 75 degrees outside. A group
of friends are playing Frisbee in
the Diag. You want to join them
and soak in the warm sun, but
you have a huge exam to study for.
The idea of locking yourself in the
UGLI all afternoon seems worse
than failing your first blue-book
exam.
Well, you don't have to shut
yourself in the stuffy library when
you can study in the Nichols Arbo-
retum, more commonly known as
the Arb.
Many students fail to take
advantage of the hidden paradise
during their time at the Univer-
sity. Just a few yards past Mary
Markley Residence Hall, the Arb
provides a close escape to students
When you're looking to get out
ofthe monotony ofSouth Universi-
ty and State Street for a day, Gallup
Park is the destination. Less than
a ten-minute drive from central
campus, Gallup Park serves as the
perfect escape when you just need
to get away from it all.
The 69-acre park is situated
along the Huron River and Ged-
des Pond. It contains both a canoe
livery and a three-and-a-quarter-
mile trail among many other rec-
reational attractions.
In the summer and early fall,

looking to break away from Ann
Arbor's busy urban life, and it'sthe
perfect place to experience Michi-
gan's four seasons.
In the spring, wildlife such as
squirrels and rabbitsromp through
the grounds, closely approaching
visitors.
When the sun reappears after
hibernating all winter, students
spread blankets on the grassy hills
to either tan, crack open biology
books or nap.
Others students avoid the hot,
stale air in the CCRB and opt to
exercise in the Arb, which offers
several nature trails for walking or
jogging.
In the summer, the Arb is an
ideal setting for a picnic with

friends. Many townees also visit
the Arb with their family, which
makes ita wonderful place to peo-
ple-watch.
Autumn's arrival is marked by
the forest leaves changing from
emerald to burnt orange, and
visitors to the Arb layer on sweat-
shirts and thick sweaters to evade
the crisp chill.
After the first snowfall, daring
students steal dining hall trays
to use as makeshift sleds and test
out the Arb's slopes. Others gather
groups of friends tobattle in snow-
ball fights. Don't miss out on the
opportunity to visit the Arb during
the next four years. Mother nature
won't disappointyou.
-STEPHANIE STEINBERG

the diag central campus
At the center of campus, and in
many ways at the center of the Michi-
gan experience, the Diag will take
countless forms during your time here.
The long, grassy expanse with criss-
crossing sidewalks is surrounded by
campus buildings, punctuated on one
end by the Hatcher Graduate Library
and at the otherby the Rackham Grad-
uate School.
The cemented paths originated
while the Diag was still a pasture
(outhouses and all) that students and
faculty would use as a shortcut to go
between class buildings.
When the weather is temperate, the
Diag is consistently populated with
members of the University community.
You'll see people studying in the grass,
throwing a Frisbee around, playing
music and openly sharing opinions.
The brass block "M" in the center of
the patio section of the Diag is full of
myth and tradition. Superstitious stu-
dents avoid stepping on it because leg-
end has it that doing so will cause one
to fail his or her first blue book exam
- a claim perpetuated (and probably
invented) by tour guides for prospec-
tive students. Also, students proudly
take shifts guarding the "M" from
Spartan vandalism during the week
preceding the annual football game
against Michigan State.
There is always something happen-
ing on the Diag: things spontaneous
and small, like a few musicians strum-
ming acoustic guitars, as well as social
gatherings like "Hash Bash," acelebra-
tion of marijuana and Ann Arbor's lax
pot laws held on the first Saturday of
every April.
Chances are you'll have a reason to
walk through the diag at least once a
day. Don't pass it up, especially when
the weather's nice.
-MATT AARONSON
Students may see families with chil-
dren running about during the spring
and summer,but duringthe fallthe park
tends tobe quieter and can definitelybe
auniquestudyretreat, especiallybefore
winter closes in. Gallup Park is one of
Ann Arbor's hidden treasures and cer-
tainly a place you don't want to miss
during your time at Michigan.

Orchid Lane, a groovy local
purveyor of fair-trade goods, is
relatively unknown despite its
many charms. Tucked between
Encore Records and the Orchid
Lane wholesale store on East Lib-
erty, the store, wafts incense and
is vaguely reminiscent of 1970s
Woodstock. It carries anachro-
nistic paisley dresses made of
gauzy fabrics, among more mod-
ern offerings by upscale brands
including Kensie and Betsey
Johnson.
The store is also stocked with
t-shirts featuring Bob Marley, as
well as shirts urging "More Love,
Less Waste." "Earthiness" per-
meates the store, in the store's
layout and offerings as well as
the store's message.
Scads of jewelry hang from
displays, and many of the stores
trinkets are imported from

India. Colorful cloth totes fea-
turing Bollywood images, silver
anklets, and even jeweled bindis
can be found at the store.
A step next door will take
you into the Orchid Lane Ware-
house, where all offerings are
$15 or under - perfect for stu-
dent budgets. Bajas, the apparel
manifestation of pot culture, can
be found in all sizes for both men
and women and are ideal for the
next Hash Bash demonstration
on the Diag.
The warehouse also carries
a wide array of cold-weather
accessories for those brisk Mich-
igan winters. The ever-popular
pashmina scarf comes in vibrant
hues ranging from bright laven-
der to dark crimson.
For your nextshopping expen-
diture, consider Orchid, Lane.

btb burrito 810 s. state st. 1734.222.4822

mr. spot's 1 808 s. state st. 734.747.7768

Mr. Spots doesn't do gimmicks.
It isn't open until 4 a.m, your food
doesn't arrive in less than 30 seconds
and the menu issomewhatlimited. It
doesn't do ambiance, either. Bever-
ages come in large Styrofoam cups,
salads are served with prepackaged
Ken's dressing and the walls are bare
except for a few newspaper clippings
and Michigan sports posters. The
place barely even does customer ser-
vice. So how has the "Philadelphia
style steak and hoagie shop" devel-
oped such a cult following?
Because what Spots does do, it
does better than anyone else. The
steak and chicken come off the grill
soft and flavorfulserved onabuttery
roll and slathered with cheese and
onions. The waffle-fries are delight-
fully greasy, tinged a light orange
with special seasoning. Even the cold
deli sandwiches, an afterthought at
some other eateries, overflow with
fresh meat and cheese.
But while Mr. Spot's may pride
itself on hoagies and sandwiches,
any true regular knows that its
wings truly set the place apart from
anywhere else. Allegedly "award
winning," they come in only three

flavors: BBQ, original hot and sui-
cide. Like everything else at Spots,
it'll take a while for the employees
to make the wings. To be specific,
it'll take exactly the amount of time
it takes you to start wondering why
you bother walking allthe way down
South State, only to forgo the cheap-
er and faster Big Ten Burrito and
Quickie Burgertime aftertime.
Once the guy at the register walks
over and places that red basket in
front of you, muttering a bored
'here,' then you know you've come
to the right place. The first thing
you notice is the color. The wings
are bright orange, and the sauce
isn't lightly painted on like at Buf-
falo Wild Wings. These plump, juicy
wings and drumsticks are drenched
in sticky, spicy hot sauce. After a few
bites, your brow will sweat and your
mouth will burn. After a few more,
you won't care. A few minutes and a
few dozen paper napkins later, you'll
know why more than a few alumni
- Tom Brady and Steve Hutchinson
among them -make sure to stop in
at Spots on any return trip to Ann
Arbor. Hint: it's not the ambiance.

So it's 2 a.m. on Friday night,
and you just walked out of a fra-'
ternity party. Passing out in your
twin-size dorm bed sounds like
a good idea right about now, but
as you stumble out of the house,
you're quickly engulfed with
an instant craving for food. Let
me introduce you to the "drunk
munchies." This is something
many college students experience
on a weekly or, perhaps, daily
basis. When the munchies take
hold of you, various food choices
begin to swirl around in your
head.
However, at this time of night,
you don't want just any food. You
want a meal that will really hit the
spot and only a few places can sat-
isfy that hunger. One such place is
Big Ten Burrito - BTB for short -
located on South State Street.

MAX COLUN5/Daily
When you first walk into this
food establishment, you might
not think much of the Ann Arbor
landmark with its eight mid-20th
century chairs and its one table
that's on the verge of collapsing
every time some drunken fool
tries to plop his butt on it. From its
original chicken quesadilla to its
vegetarian chimichanga, you're in
for a real treat. If any one of the six
different burritos isn't your thing,
try BTB's mouth-watering steak
nachos or its classic chicken taco.
Whatever your heart's desire and
stomach's wish, BTB can give you
what you need. But don't expect to
be out of there quick. Lines usu-
ally stretch out the door and down
the sidewalk, so be prepared to
wait five or 10 minutes. Trust me,
it'll be worth it.
-MARK BURNS

After your first week of fresh-
man year, maybe you've already
developed an enormous obsession
with four-star quarterback and San
Diego, Calif. native Tate Forcier.
Since arriving in Ann Arbor, maybe
you've also wanted to slap hands
with high-flying Michigan basket-
ball stars Manny "Fresh" Harris
and Deshawn Sims. Chances are,
you might never get a chance to wit-
ness these players up close and per-
sonal unless you takea stroll over to
Bell'sPizzaonthe corner ofPackard
and South State.
The decrepit-looking building is
the home of some of the finest piz-
zas, hot oven grinders, and subs on
campus. Bell's is the local hangout
for many athletes on Fridayand Sat-
urday nights during the academic
year. Student-athletes as well as
students flock to the more-then-30

-year-old local pizza joint on week-
ends for a few slices of pepperoni or
cheese pizza at a fairly decent price.
Ifyou'relookingforalittlevariety
inyour life,tryoneoftheirspecialty
pizzas like the Hawaiian delight
or chicken barbecue. Additionally,
Bell's offers a wide array of calzones
like its mouth-wateringchicken cal-
zone. If that's not yourthing, try one
of their 11 sizzling subs that will be
sure to soften those hunger pains.
Bell's is to meet, greet and fulfill
yourtaste budseverytimeyouenter.
They're open till 4 a.m., so you can
grab that snack before hitting the
hay. And if you're lucky, your visitto
Bell's could include a conversation
with one of Michigan's superstar
athletes and perhaps a photo shoot.
But don't expect the picture to be
free. It might cost you a slice or two.

While living in Ann Arbor
and attending the 'U', it is likely
that you'll come across costume
parties, themed get-togethers,
formals and other swank shin-
digs. You may think this city
offers little to outfit your needs,
but vintage collector Kelly
McLeoud's "The Getup" has
countless vintage items to rep
your style.
Additionally, The Getup
offers a rare and wide variety of
vintage items spanning from the
1920s to the 1980s that make the
city a hotspot within the state
for stylish secondhand clothing.
McLeoud's trained eye for vin-
tage pieces has led to The Getup
priding itself on the uniqueness

SAM WOLSON/Daily
of its items rather than on their
brand names (though there is a
reasonable collection of Pucci
and your occasional vintage
Rayban wayfarers, Dior sun-
glasses and vintage wool Izod
sweaters).
The Getup houses one of the
largest collections of authentic
vintage rock band T-shirts, while
also containing a wide selection
of western boots and leather
jackets for men and women.
McLeoud tells her custom-
ers to walk into her store with a
sense of humor to appreciate her
quirky and eccentric pieces, and
there's no doubt you'll leave The
Getup with a rad sense of style.
