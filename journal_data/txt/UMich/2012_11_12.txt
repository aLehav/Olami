ELECTION 2012
A2 officials
dismayed by
rejection of
art millage

City to continue
using Percent for
Art funding model
By TAYLOR WIZNER
Daily StaffReporter
City officials said they were
disappointed in the wake of the
rejection by Ann Arbor voters of
a tax for a more comprehensive
public art program on Election
Day.
Public art administrator
Aaron Seagraves said he was
surprised the millage was
rejected, and though he could
not speculate on voter senti-
ment, he supposed the new
model of funding could have
drivenvoters away.
"I'm not sure why it wasn't
passed by voters," Seagraves
said. "The Percent for Art fund-
ing could have been preferred
to the funding on the millage.
Maybe that's why the voters
thought they didn't need a new
millage for it."
The millage was an alterna-
tive to the current public arts
funding program Percent for
Art, which has encountered dif-
ficulty in providing public arts

projects under heavy restric-
tions that limit displays to per-
manent art installations on
specified government proper-
ties. Following rejection of the
proposal, Ann Arbor will return
to the previous model; which
utilizes city funding ratherthan
tax money from residents.
The tax would have cost the
average homeowner about $11
a month and was expected to
bring in about $450,000 annu-
ally. The new model for fund-
ing included a mill tax model
for funding public arts in Ann
Arbor. Instead of the current
system, which takes the funds
from different departments in
the city, the funding for projects
would come directly from the
residents.
Seagraves noted that lack of
awareness about the proposal
could have added to the dismiss-
al by voters.
"There wasn't a whole lot
of time to go campaign," Sea-
graves said. "Between the idea
of it being on the ballot, it was
probably two months between
Election Day and when it was
put on the ballot."

he temptation is strong
, to look at how the
game went on Satur-
day afternoon and point to luck
for how Michigan snatched a win
away from Northwestern, for
doing it as quickly and ruthlessly
as the Wolverines did.
It'd be easy to say that Devin
Gardner and Kenny Demens and
Roy Roundtree and company
should be praised les§ for win-
ning and admonished more for
how they let the game nearly

slip away -
how they put
themselves at
the whim of a
miracle to be
able to crawl
away with a
victory. (Mir-
acle or baf-
fling mistake
by the Wild-
cats, however
you want to
look at it.)

It wouldn't be heresy to say
that Michigan had no business
winning this game, that this
team - with all of its champion-
ship aspirations, which it can
still cling to thanks to this win
- didn't deserve its seventh win
based on its performance on Sat-
urday.
But don't tell that to them.
"We've got a lot that we didn't
do well, but we did do well when
you win the football game," said
Michigan coach Brady Hoke.

In truth, it'd be hard to say
iwith a straight face that the Wol-
verines played the type of win-
ning football that you needto play
to win.most weeks.

Annual event
unites students
and local youth
By ALICIA ADAMCZYK
Daily Staff Reporter
Though the Diag is usually
filled with 20-somethings on a
typical weekday, about sixty 9
and 10 year-olds took over cam-
pus on Friday afternoon.
K-Day, a collaboration
between K-Grams - a Univer-
sity program that pair~s college
students and elementary-aged
children in a variety of mentor-
ing activities - and the Big Ten
Network, united students from
two local elementary schools
with University students Friday
to partake ina slew of activities,
ranging from a tour of the Uni-
versity of Michigan Museum of
Art to a dance marathon in the
Diag.
Between games of four-
square and lunch in South Quad
Residence Hall, the third grad-
ers from Ann Arbor's Dicken
Elementary and Detroit's Dixon
Elementary engaged in a jam-
packed schedule filled with
hands-on activities, including
interactive chemistry experi-

ments, an arts and crafts ses-
sion, an athlete meet-and-greet
and atour of the dorms.
In addition to activities
planned throughout the day,
K-grams collected school sup-
plies from University students
to donate to disadvantaged
schools in Ypsilanti and Detroit.
During the field day se*-
sion of Friday's events, kids
jumped rope, chalked the Diag
and received autographs from
various University athletes,
including members of the men's
swimming and diving team, the
women's track team and the
Triathlon Club.
Education senior Roman
Willets, a member of the men's
swim team, said K-Day was a
great way for kids and Universi-
ty students to interact and learn
from each other.
"It's always a lot of fun for
us with the kids," Willets said.
"But at the same time, any time

GWU misreports admissions

George Washington Uni-
versity misrepresented the
percentage of incoming fresh-
man who graduated in the
top 10 percent of their high
school classes, the GW Hatchet
reported on Thursday.
Though GWU reported that
78 percent of the school's 2015
class graduated at the top of
their respective classes, the
provost's office discovered an
error that indicated the actual
percentage was only 58 per-
cent.
Though Forrest Maltzman,
GWU's senior vice provost for
academic affairs and planning,
claimed the mistake was an
accident, it still has the poten-

tial to damage the university's
ranking by U.S. News & World
Report, which currently ranks
GWU 51st in the nation. The
strength of an incoming fresh-
man class is about 6 percent of
a school's total score.
YALE UNIVERSITY
ANNOUNCES NEW
PRESIDENT
On Thursday, the Yale
University governing board
announced that Yale Provost
Peter Salovey would succeed
Yale President Richard Levin
as university president begin-
ning in the fall, the Yale Daily
News reported Friday.

Salovey will become the
university's 23rd president.
The announcement was made
after the Presidential Search
Committee spent almost three
months searching for Levin's
replacement after Levin
announced his resignation in
August.
Salovey has served as Yale's
provost since 2008, but has
been affiliated with the univer-
sity since his days as a gradu-
ate student. He also served as a
professor and dean of Yale Col-
lege - the university's under-
graduate program - and the
Graduate School of Arts and
Sciences.

defense found itself on its heels
for almost the entire game, torn
up by the speed of Venric Mark
and Kain Colter and the arm of
Trevor Siemian, a player who
may never have as good a passing
day as he did here against Michi-
gan.
Not when Gardner inexpli-
cably threw an interception on
what should have been the game-
winning drive with 3:37 remain-
ing.
Yet for all the wrong on Satur-
day, there was right, right when it
mattered the most. And that's all
that matters in a game that judg-
es only on 'W's' and 'L's."
Given one final chance - and
that is the appropriate word
here, since having just 18 seconds
means you're doomed to rely on
the impulses of fortune, at least
somewhat - Michigan picked the
winning numbers.
Fifth-year senior J.T. Floyd - a
symbol of his whole team, since
he repeatedly comes under fire by
opposing passers yet keeps com-
ing back resolute - told Gardner
before the final Michigan drive
that the defense had given the

tions from the community.
"When I asked voters direct-
ly on my e-mail list what they
thought of the proposal, some
were very much in favor of it, and
some were very much against it
because it would be an additional
tax and because they liked the
current program as it was consti-
tuted," Taylor said. "There are a
variety of reasons why one might
vote against it, and I think it is
hard to say specifically."
Taylor said there have been pro-
posed plans within City Council to
alter the Percent for Art program.
One proposal, he said, would stop*
the program completely, and the
other would limit the program to
a smaller set of projects.

als that I know of," Taylor said. "I
am sure the city councilmembers
will bring them forward at the
next meeting."
However, Taylor added there

ity through social media, partly
because registration took place on
Facebook.
The event featured four pan-
els, each of which contained well-
known leaders from different
realms within the sports industry.
Panel topics included revenue in
college sports, branding, advertis-
ing and the media. Student attend-
ees had the opportunity to hear
from Business School namesake
Stephen M. Ross, the chairman and
founder of Related Companies real
estate firm, and MLB.com CEO
Bob Bowman, who discussed the
current state of digital and online
sports marketing. Students were

also given time to network with
speakers and fellow attendees.
Rohan Oza, the former chief
marketing officer of Vitamin
Water, delivered the conference's
keynote speech in a presentation
titled "Creative Disruption," in
which he delved into how to create
a brand using athletes as leverage.
Oza said creating an innovative
brand is challenging, but testing
the status quo is key.
"Have an original idea, be pas-
sionate about it, believe in your-
self, create a culture, partner with
the right people and breakthrough
using creative disruption," Oza
said.
Cairo, the event co-founder, said
Oza was the best speaker of the
day, and instilled a sense of drive
and inspiration among attendees.
"He had an extremely animat-
ed presentation on how to build
brands," Cairo said. "He shared
some really innovative ideas that
now other (chief marketing offi-
cers) are starting to use as they
look to build brands."
When Ross and Bowman
addressed the crowd, they offered
insight into how to enhance fan
experiences at professional foot-
ball and baseball games and how
to make attending games more
appealing over simply watching on
television.

offense a chance, so it was time to
go take care of business.
Gardner, facing his first all-
the-pressure-in-the-world situ-
ation in just his second start at
quarterback, told the huddle that
they had worked too hard not
to go down and score, to not go
down and shock 112,000 fans into
euphoria for the second time in as
many home games.
"We had the ball with a chance.
That's all you can ask for," Gard-
ner said simply.
And despite all the so-so play
from the rest of the game and the
minimal time they had left, and
thus despite all the reason in the
world not to believe, the Wolver-
ines nonetheless did. Redshirt
junior offensive tackle Taylor
Lewan was "never worried one
time," in his words.
Hoke will lie to the media with
impunity and not even feel guilty
about it, but he wouldn't lie to his
wife - and the coach said that
when she asked if he knew if his
team was going to win, he replied
in the affirmative.
"These kids have been great,"
Hoke said. "It didn't surprise me.
It really didn't surprise me."
These aren't the words of a
team that particularly cares if
it does things the pretty way,
have been no attempts to include
temporary art - a key part of the
proposed millage - in any of the
proposals.
"Under the current One Per-
cent for Arts program there is no
possibility to fund temporary art,
and I don't expect that to change,"
Taylor said.
Mark Tucker - the Lloyd Hall
Scholars Program art director and
founder of FestiFools, an annual
parade of papier-mch puppets
created by students and members
of the community - said he was
disappointed to see the proposal
fail, but was not surprised by the
result.
"I'm not completely surprised
because it would be unusual for a
community to come out in strong
favor of wanting its tax dollars to
go towards public art, but I think it
probably has to do with education
in terms of how much the public
art millage committee had time to
get out the information," Tucker
said.,
Tucker said-FestiFools would
have benefited from the mill-
age, but the organization would
survive without city funding. He
said he was an adamant supporter
of the proposal more because of
Rhodes said he was satisfied
with the result of the conference
and it exceeded his expectations.
"After a year and a half of plan-
ning, all of the speakers came
through, they're all dynamic, and
the crowd was into it," Rhodes
said. "I got a lot of feedback from
students saying this was the best
conference they've been to at the
Business School."
Big Ten Network President
Mark Silverman, a panelist, said
keeping alumni connected to their
universities upon graduation is
a goal of Big Ten Network and is
way' of measuring success among
media outlets that cover college
sports, adding that fan loyalty is
permanent, which is a key differ-
ence between college and profes-
sional sports.

"Your college days resonate
with you,".Silverman said. "It's a
remarkable business because there
are thousands and thousands of
fans, and our market grows each
year with each new graduating
class."
Panelist Stephen Master, the
vice president and head of sports
practice at the Nielsen Company -
a worldwide marketing company
- said building relationships inthe
industry is most importantto find-
ing success.
"Don't burn any bridges, and
continue to build great relation-

because a conference champion-
ship trophy is the only beautiful
thing it cares about.
Michigan will focus on its mis-
takes simply because it knows
that to repeat them is to make
its job that much harder. But at
the end of the day, a game full of
questionable play will be remem
bered only by Gardner's throw,
Roundtree's catch, redshirt junior
Brendan Gibbons's kick and the
win that followed. (Overtime was
a mere formality.)
And at this time of year, it
doesn't matter how you do it -
you just have to win.
"I think Coach Hoke always
emphasizes getting better each
and every week, but I think that
this was one ofthose games where
while we.didn't play all that well,
I think that we showed a lot of
character this week," said fifth
year senior safety Jordan Kovacs,
the new recipient of the Wistert
brothers' legends jersey.
"We overcame a lot of adver-
sity, both offensively and defen-
sively, and I'm prouder than hell

desire for additional FestiFools

"We supported the public
arts millage because the fund-
ing mechanism would have been
cleaner than the current one,"
Tucker said. "It would have meant
that groups like ours that do tem-
porary public art might have been
considered for spending."
With the program returning
Percent for Art for financing, Sea-
graves, along with members on
the Ann Arbor Public Art Com-
mission, will allocate the city-
provided funds to public arts
projects.
Tucker said he is not worried
about losing public art in Ann
Arbor, but warned that if the city
is not careful it could lose a ben-
eficial economic opportunity.
"I think the prognosis for pub-
lic art in Ann Arbor is still strong,"
Tucker said. "If for some reason
the City Council does away with
the current model, then I thik
we are back to square one, and I

change jobs in the business, you'll
still have the connections and the
trust that you've established."
Hunter Lochmann, the Michi-
gan Athletic Department's chief
marketing officer, said the stu-
dents did an impressive job, par-
ticularly considering this was the
conference's first year.
"I think it (the conference) has
exceeded everyone's expectations
and I've heard from many respected
people in the industry who were
justoverwhelmedwithhowwell it's
gone, particularly with a first year
program," Lochmann said. "I think
altruistically, alumni want to come

cially if it's the students that they
can relate to, it makes it that much
better. I think it goes to show the

power ofthe Michiganbrand."
Echoing the sentiments of
many other attendees, LSA soph-
omore Andrew Murphy said he
was inspired to continue gaining
insight into the sports business
industry.
"I hope to learn a little more
about the different sides of the
business of sports, especially on
the marketing and management
level," Murphy said. "I've been
involved in the lower level of man-
agement but not the higher level,
and I hope to learn what I need to
do to succeed in this business."

this week, the group has put
together a preliminary 20-year,
$60-million proposal based on
issues and concerns raised by
students, emphasizing that the
plan is "not set in stone."
According to a polling of 1,537
students conducted by the pro-
gram management firm Brails-
ford & Dunlaveyearlier this year,
87 percent of students said they
considered improvements to
University unions and recreation
center to be a priority. Addition-
ally, 67 percent of students said
they would support a $100 fee
per semester for the renovations
and 58 percent said they would
support a fee between $150 and
$200.
While the plan could increase
University tuition, Mirante said
students at other schools often
pay more than $150 for recre-
ational sports or unions.
"Right now Purdue (students)
pays about.$235 per year for their
rec buildings, which is below the
national average, and we don't
pay anything," Mirante said.
Still, Mirante cautioned that
the potential fees are only based
on the renovations proposed
by Building a Better Michigan,
which are still subject to change.
LSA senior Caroline Can-
ning, president of LSA Student
Government, said in an October
interview that the first phase,
which will last seven to 10 years,

mance of his own. The third-
grader drew a crowd of about
100 people as he flipped and
2-stepped in front of Hatcher
Graduate Library.
Candice Weaver, a teacher at
Dixon Elementary, said her stu-
dents aren't normally exposed
to an atmosphere like that of the
University and she thought the
event was a great opportunity
for them to learn about college
life.
"They didn't know what
dorms were," Weaver said.
"When I told them ... they said
'You mean they don't-sleep with
their moms and dads?'
Education junior Abby Ingall,
one of the organizers of the
day's events, said she thought
the day ran smoothly and hoped
would address mainly the Michi-
gan Union and the Central Cam-
pus Recreation Building and, to
a lesser extent, the Intramural
Sports Building, Pierpont Com-
mons and the North Campus
Recreation Building in addition
to adding artificial turf and fenc-
ing to Mitchell Field on Fuller
Road.
Phase two would address the
Michigan League and finishing
renovations to the Intramural
Sports Building, and phase three
would involve the complete
rebuilding of Pierpont Commons
to convert it into a combined
union and recreation center.
"So phase two and three are
very far in the future," LSA
senior Peter Wasky said in Octo-
ber. "We're definitely trying to
include that in our plan to show
that we really do view this as
a complete package, but just
within the financial constraints
that the University is under right
now, it's not feasible to do all six
buildings at once."
During Fall Break, Building
a Better Michigan organized a
two-day trip, free to any student,
to visit unions and recreation
centers at Ohio State University,
Purdue University and Indiana
University-Purdue University
Indianapolis.
Canning said all three univer-
sities had either recently reno-
vated their unions or recreation
centers, or that their buildings
had features the group felwoulde
'he important to consider fortheir-
future plans. Purdue's recreation
centers had been open for less
than a week since renovations
had taken place during Bilding
a Better Michigan's Fall Break
tour.
In particular, Canning and
Wasky noted some of the recre-
ation centers they visited were a
hub for student life rather than
just a place for students to exer-
cise.

that K-grams would be able to
expand the activities in future
events.
"This is the first year we've
been sponsored by the Big Ten
Network," Ingall said. "We're
trying to grow the program that
way."
LSA sophomores Bryn Ander-
son and Becca Liebschtz, both
members of K-grams, were in
charge of the school supplies
drive. Liebschutz said the col-
lection was an important part
of K-Day and she was happy to
help.
"We've had our while bin
filled up (with supplies); plus
three other bags," Liebschutz
said. "We've gotten a lot of
response, which is nice."
"One thing that we saw that I
was really struck by is all of the
rec facilities that we saw had
demo kitchens in them and well-
ness suites where you can go and
talk to a nutritionist," Wasky
said.
Canning added that some of
the recreation buildings had
counseling offices comparable
to the University's Counseling
and Psychological Services and
the Sexual Assault Prevention &
Awareness Center located within
them, in addition to other loca-
tionson campus.
While Canning said there is
less space at the University's rec-
reation centers than at similar
buildings at peer colleges, the
problem arises is how the space
is utilized.
"For the union, we went to
Ohio State where the building
wasn't much larger," she said. "It
felt as if it was two times larger
than our union just because how
the layout was structured, the
different types of rooms that
were there, the floor plan."
Wasky said one feature of the
OSU union that he would like to
see incorporated at the Univer-
sity is the ability to see multiple
floors at once. He said an open
vertical space stretching from
the basement to the third floor
of the Michigan Union has been
discussed.
Canning added that having a
24-hour access area of the OSU
union was another feature she
woid'like to see'at the Michigan
Union.
Nonetheless, Mirante said not
every feature the group saw on
the tour can be incorporated into
the buildings at the University.
"It's not a copy and paste type
of project," he said. "We went to
go find some elements of other
buildings that would inspire
a type of design that would fit
with the history of our buildings
and the needs of our students."

FROM THE DAILY
Deservede Sfense
Legal counsel shouldn't vary throughout Mich.
Due process of law and the right to a fair trial are key indi-
cators of a functioning democracy. The U.S. Constitution
specifically guarantees "assistance of counsel" for every
defendant. Yet this right is not always guaranteed, even in the state
of Michigan. Some people are wrongly convicted and incarcerated
because they can't afford skilled legal advice or a certain county is
unable to provide representation due to a lack of funding. Citizens
being denied the right to afair trial because of inadequate resourc-
es is an unacceptable reality. On Thursday, the Michigan House
of Representatives - with bipartisan support - passed a bill that
would create a new system to oversee proper legal representation
for low-income defendants. This is a positive step toward ensuring
all citizens, regardless of their financial status, receive a qualified
attorney and a fair trial.

The fact is that there's a large group of
people who like Donald Trump and what
Donald Trump says. I have no regrets."
- Donald Trump said in response to his Twitter tirade, in which he called Obama's victory "a sham,
travesty and disgusting injustice," according to Businessweek.
The'United'States ofAmerica

Michigan has been widely criticized for an
inadequate job of assignment of legal counsel.
Much of the criticism is due to the decentralized
process of assigning lawyers to those who can-
not afford their own. House Bill 5804 proposes
centralizing the process, creating a 14-member
Michigan Indigent Defense Commission. This
commission will be responsible for overseeing
the appointment and performance of lawyers
representing low-income defendants.
Reports show that 45of83 Michigan counties
are spending below the state average of $7.83
per resident for indigent defense. As a result,
innocent people may have a greater chance of
incarceration simply because their county can't
spend enough money to provide them appro-
priate defense. The commission would seek to
level the playing field between public defenders
and prosecutors, while providing good attor-
neys for low-income defendants.
Since counties are struggling to correctly
appropriate funds on their own, this com-
mission would better the system and provide
defendants with a fair trial. Without proper
legal defense, it's quite possible that innocent

individuals are being incarcerated. This does
not line up with the justice system that our
founding fathers had in mind.
This commission will ensure proper spend-
ing to send the guilty to jail, while providing
satisfactory defense for all. It will also save
taxpayer money in the long run, as it is more
costly to fund incarceration of innocent indi-
viduals than to pay for a competent representa-
tive to begin with. Each year, the costs and fees
associated with incarceration of one person
is $35,000. Even providing each low-income
individual with a well-paid and qualified law-
yer would not match the price of incarcerating
innocent individuals. This money can be used
elsewhere in our struggling state.
As citizens, and as human beings, we have
the moral obligation to do anything possible to
ensure that innocent people are not wrongly
convicted. This commission takes a positive
step toward making this horrifying scenario
less likely to occur. All people deserve a fair
trial with proper legal representation, so if
counties can't provide a fair trial, it is the state's
responsibility to rectify the practice.

Wt e are not a collec-
tion of red states
and blue states -
we are, and for-
ever will be, the
United States of
America."
I first heard
these words on
July 27, 2004
during the
Democratic
National Con- PATRICK
vention's key- MAILLET
note address.
I watched a
youthful, black senator from Illi-
nois - whom I had never heard of
before, and whose name I couldn't
pronounce - enchant the crowd
with this simple, yetbrilliant creed.
Watching the speech on TV, my
mom and I just looked at each other
and said, "Whoa, who is this guy?"
1,272 days later, my mom and Isat
at the steps of the U.S. Capitol Build-
ing crying with a crowd of 2-mil-
lion people as we watched President
Barack Obama once again reiterate
this inspiring mantra during his
inaugural address.
And last Tuesday night, I could
do nothing but smile, teary-eyed, as
I watched Obama preach this creed
once more in his victory speech.
Although it has taken this coun-
try far too long to appreciate these
words, we are finally on the brink.
In the President's first term, par-
tisanship handcuffed our govern-
ment and ensured that little got
achieved. Nothing exemplified this
better than Senate Minority Leader
Mitch McConnell's daunting words
from 2010: "The single most impor-
tant thing we want to achieve is for
President Obama to be a one-term
president."
During the debt crisis last sum-
mer, we -watched as a desperate.
Speaker of the House John Boehner
seemed to be torn between sensible
Republicans willing to compromise
and radicals more focused on cutting
Planned Parenthood than actually
solving the nation's pressing prob-
lems. Terrified of mutiny, Boehner
refused to even consider the possibil-

ity of raising taxes and allowed the
Tea Party radicals to overpower the
Old Guard Republicans.
Although Obama won a second
term as president, Tuesday night's
real winner was Boehner. Of the 16
Senate candidates endorsed by the
TeaPartyExpress, 12 lost, and some
of the more radical Tea Party repre-
sentatives also lost their reelection
bids. The Tea Party movement was
able to hijack Congress in the 2010
midterm elections, but America has
finally woken up and realized these
radicals' only accomplishment is
dividing our government even fur-
ther. Boehner has finally regained
control of his party, and with that
newfound power the opportunities
of these next four years are truly
endless.
Now, hopefully, Boehner and
other Republicans will understand
that a Tea Party-dominated politi-
cal conversation is no longer savvy.
The American people have loudly
proclaimed their distrust and dis-
appointment in Tea Party-grid-
locked government.
Do I expect Boehner and his
majority to suddenly become a pack
of wild liberals who rubber-stamp
everything the President puts in
front of them? Absolutely not. How-
ever, the message was made loud
and clear last week by the American
people: radicalism will not be toler-
ated and compromise isvital. Finally,
the adults in the room can have a civil
conversation without the disobedi-
ent brat that is the Tea Party getting
in the way of reliable legislation.
Whether it's tackling the
impending "fiscal cliff,"- a fast
approaching expiration date for
many tax cuts and deductions -
lessening our dependence on for-
eign oil or finally taking on the
perils of climate change, compro-
mise between the President and
levelheaded House Republicans is
essential to effectively deal with
the issues we face. Without the
fear of Tea Party backlash, perhaps
Republicans will finally be will-
ing to couple modest tax increases
with spending cuts, the only realis-
tic way to eliminate our deficit and

begin to pay down our debt.
A lot of people accuse me of being
far too idealistic. They claim that
Washington D.C. will just go back
to being what it has been for the
last two years. There's definitely a
chance this will happen. Many are
already losing faith in our govern-
ment in response to Boehner's Fri-
day ABC News interview when he
stated that any tax rate increases
are "unacceptable" in terms of bar-
gaining with the President.
The U.S. could
be on the brink
of a bipartisan
breakthrough.
This interview was somewhat
ominous, but politics is also a lot
like poker - you never show the
other guy your cards. Boehner may
eventually be coerced into agreeing
to modest tax increases, particu-
larly on the wealthy, but he would
never reveal that prior to the onset
of the negotiations - that would
just be poor bargaining skills.
America could very well be on
the brink of a major bipartisan
breakthrough. The odds are cer-
tainly stacked against us - the
markets don't have faith in us, the
credit rating agencies are skeptical
and most Americans have already
lost hope. Obama and Boehner must
seize their respective opportunities
and help lead this country.
After all, if debt ends up crush-
ing our future or if climate change
ends up reshaping our country, the
effects won't only be felt by red
states or blue states, they will be felt
by all of us. Unity has always been
the key to America's success, and
although many believe America's
best days are behind us, I look to the
future more hopeful than ever.

Beyond pnthe pk ribbons


This past month, you've probably seen the
color pink everywhere on campus - on the
Diag, Angell Hall club tables, the "Go Blue,
Wear Pink" t-shirts, Facebook pages and
even a "Best Chest" competition at a sorority.
The color pink has successfully been asso-
ciated with breast cancer awareness in our
minds. Have you ever seen another cancer
advertised? Even if you have, its visibility is
nowhere close to breast cancer's.
Don't get me wrong; the color pink has led
breast cancer to needed improvement, even
though it's still the second leading cancer in
women. But now it has turned into a market.
The survival rate of breast cancer is continu-
ously improving, and more women are get-
ting check-ups yearly. In the last 60 years,
survival rates have tripled. True, awareness
helped this upsurge, but the breast cancer
market has shifted. Breast cancer isn't just a
cancerous disease any more. It's marketable,
profitable and even exploitative. For example,
Sextoy.com offers a "Breast Cancer Aware-
ness" vibrator. Other products that have used
the pink ribbon include Evian water bottles,
guns with pink handles, Panera, Fuze bottles,
the National Football League, Yoplait yogurt,
pepper spray, Hungry Howie's pizza, Mike's
Hard Pink Lemonade and flowers at Kroger.
The list goes on and on. Attaching the color
pink encourages a purchase done for the com-
pany's own benefit.
If you're somehow associated with a differ-
enttype ofcancer,continuallyseeingthe color
pink may create a negative opinion towards
the way breast cancer awareness is handled.
If you search "cancer awareness" on Google
images, you are greeted only with pink, pink

and more pink. This doesn't just happen dur-
ing breast cancer awareness month.
Karuna Jagger, an executive director of
Breast Cancer Action, is offended by the cur-
rent state of awareness. "Pink has become a
distraction. You put a pink ribbon on it, (and)
people stop asking questions," Jagger said.
The color pink isn't serving its purpose of
working against breast cancer anymore - it's
simply being used now for publicity.
Research and awareness is needed for
more than just breast cancer; breast cancer
is no longer the highest leading risk and now
many women repeatedly get mammograms.
It has been the most funded cancer for years.
The American Cancer Society gets the major-
ity of its donations for breast cancer. Spread-
ing the news that September is Childhood
Cancer Awareness Month or that dark blue is
for colon cancer - which causes more deaths
that breast cancer - could start a change.
Promoting more than only the color pink,
could be so powerful.
I will admit to being biased because I per-
sonally battle a cancer with only a 33 percent
survival rate (Breast cancer has nearly an 80
percent survival rate). It's beyond stressful
being a cancer patient and seeing nothing but
pink advertised everywhere.
If other cancers were given support, would
their survival rates increase? Yes. There are
people who aren't surviving cancer because
there aren't as many funds available to find a
cure for their disease. It's a confusing reality
that needs to change - cancer shouldn't be
diminished to just a profitable pink ribbon.

Bond has set the bar high for the

that they can top that effort and re-

how Disney proceeds creatively, the
box office results will be there and

To call Javier Bardem's ("No

just your typical run-of-the-mill
bad guy is a bit like comparing
Heath Ledger's Joker to one of
the countless drunken imita-
tors you find running around at

command, Silva is perhaps the
most diabolical bleached-hair,
mommy-hating Latino. man ever
to take the screen, and the purr-
ing, understated nature of his
performance just makes him all
the more terrifying for it.
Unsurprisingly, he takes abso-
lute control of every scene he's in
after making his showy entrance
over an hour into the movie, stir-
ring to life a sense of ever-pres-
ent mortal fear found looming in
every crevice of the film.
The cold, contrasting imag-
ery captured by master cinema-
tographer Roger Deakins ("No
Country for Old Men") makes

"Skyfall" more than just the
most visually captivating movie
of the series. The watered-down
blues of the Scottish countryside
coupled with the cold grayness
of London and the neon-framed
coolness of nighttime Shanghai
are used like gauges by Deakins
throughout the film. Whenever
there's a functional change in
palette, Deakins shows it to us
by washing it over Bond's griz-
zled exterior. The technique is
meant to provide us with the
tiniest inklings of what may be
happening inside, but ultimately
the motivations of our hero are
left up to us for interpretation.
So is this the best Bond of all
time? At various instances, the
answer is a resounding "Yes." But
even at the points when it doesn't
ring true, the one thing worth
realizing is that without a doubt,
this is a new era in 007's distin-
guished career - one marked by
the glory of the past and the grit-
tiness of the present.

There's something par-
ticularly beautiful in

in a shoved-
under-
the-bed
backpack,
the rough
crooning of ANNA
"Wild childs, SADOVI
lookin' good
/ Livin' hard
just like we should," creates a
barrier between you and the
ugly world with its cradle-like
arms of understanding.
But, probably not. There's
nothing truly romantic in
Ke$ha's latest hit. Rather, the
hard-thumpingtechno has one
purpose: to remind the listener
of their fleeting attractiveness.
The only cure? Dancing with
a total babe and forgetting the
inevitable unhappiness that fol-
lows aging.
There's nothing wrong with
cheesy, Auto-Tuned goodness (I
love Ke$ha, no shame). In fact,
mainstream culture is entirely
reliant on the now-usual pop
style. Going out, clubbing, hav-
ing a good time and forgetting
that guy who cheated on you -
thank god we have a go-to Top
20 song for all those occasions.
But popular music hasn't always
been backed by synthesized
beats and layered voices.
That's right; I'm taking it
back - way back - and div-
ing into the oft-overlooked,
mostly ignored world of clas-
sical music. Once upon a time,
people got down to Debussy;
bounced to Beethoven; waltzed
to Vivaldi.
What is now known as clas-
sical used to be the life of the
party; the quartet in the corner
was the band to book and no
one even dreamed that one day
a half-naked girl with mussed
up hair and smudged eyeliner
would take over the radio. They
didn't even know there was
goingto be a radio.
The best part about classical
music, for me, is the imagination
behind it. There's a time and a
place for it, and when the two
line up in perfect harmony, clas-
sical music is like an orgy for
the soul.
Like when riding a bike bor-
rowed from a friend's grandma
down the bustling, bright
streets of Tokyo at night, watch-
ing the billboards flash with
symbols and photos of unfamil-

iar celebrities. Chopin's Piano
Concerto No. 2 in F minor came
on through shuffle, and for once,
my iPod nailed it: Piano strokes
reverberated the chaos of the
city, pulsing beats of a different
kind through my ears.
I imagined my life through
the music, the cadence of the
notes mimicking the rhythm of
my pedaling. No words to pause
the feeling - just a perfect com-
panion concerto to celebrate the
night with.
It was romantic. It was clas-
sical. It was edgy and cool
because everything lined up,
and ifa movie was made of my
life, I would include that scene,
that music and I would also be
played by Elizabeth Olsen, obvi-
ously.
More than likely, classical -
music gets a bad rep due to the
setting in which it's listened to.
A silent, chair-filled auditorium
that seats more than 200 people
doesn't invite any room for
feedback or conversation. Rock
concerts, pop concerts, elec-
tronic music festivals, country
hoedowns ... they all allow for
movement, foridiscussion, for
excitement. Younger genera-
tions' appreciation for music
relies on a dialogue between a
musician and a listener. Not only
are most classical composers
dead, but there's no chance of.
interaction between the artist
and audience.
Taylor Swift
is the new
Beethoven.
Ke$ha is a pop star; Taylor
Swift is a pop star; Rihanna,
Bruno Mars and Lady Gaga are
pop stars. Liking pop doesn't
mean a love for hard rock can't
develop. Liking electronic music
doesn't negate the catchiness
of hip hop. Listeningto main-
stream doesn't mean classical is
moot - only that there's more
left to discover in the musical
realm.
Listen to classical music on
your own: during study hours,
during a walk home from class,
during an awesome night out
that ends at 6 a.m. (no shame,
ever). It's then, at the times
where it's you and the music,
that the appreciation can set in.

Public bathroom stalls serve
an educational purpose. If not a
fullyinteractive guide to pop cul-
ture fandoms (Who's Sherlock,
what's a T.A.R.D.I.S. and where
is this Ministry of Magic?), a
graveyard of etched linoleum
ex-loves or a convenient surface
to sharpen your many knives,
the public bathroom stall is the
world's dictionary. Not to be
mistaken for its Oxford English
brethren, the toilet stall has
emerged as my go-to source for
every slang term, allusion to and
variation of the word "semen."
Don't flip the page in haste
- I promise to keep this clean
(mind you, the staff is paid daily
to wipe-mop-wax the area until
it's spick, span and pee-free).
Before you flee from your solo
Starbucks table to scrub your
hands clean of my perversity,
just think about the word. Con-
front it. Acknowledge it. Accept
it (and don't forget that, if you
leave, Charlie with the tall chai
latte is eager to steal your seat).
It's only a word. Just ask come-
dian Kathy Griffin.
Though such a word needs
no context, let me indulge you:
On Nov. 9, Griffin performed
her stand-up routine for her
loyal Detroit fan base (and seven
straight men dragged to the
show by drunken girlfriends)
at the Fox Theatre. Jokes aside,
the infamously banned-from-
live-TV star "shocked" me in the
simplest way: She said the word

elderly woman at my right. To
my mom. To me.
It's not like I'd never heard the
word before and not as if I don't
frequently roll my eyes at the
fact that it's carved in the stalls
of many a University bathroom.
But I couldn't help but gasp.
Where was my media guardian
angel to mute the offense? To
blur Griffin's lips as if convinced
that.I wouldn't be-able to deduct
the punch line from every third
penis joke? To obscure such
devious language with the com-
fort of a resounding BLEEEEP?

diately apparent that Hundred
intends to be a more convention-
al-sounding soul record than its
four-track equipped predeces-
sor. One constant, thankfully, is
Chesnutt's silky smooth voice,
which beams through much
more clearly on the new record.
A deeper listen suggests that
Chesnutt has taken Mitchum's
advice. The subject matter is
more worldly and relatable this
time around, and while Cody
maintains his trademark swag-
ger, he's content in the realm of
confidence versus the arrogance
of his debut.
On standout track "I've Been
Life," he takes the headstrong
line, "Since my birth I've been
the greatest / Attraction on
the Earth" and applies it to his
pride for the nations of the Afri-
can continent. Over a "Crazy in
Love"-style horn arrangement,

the line, and the song, kill.
Ultimately though, it's mostly
unsatisfying to hear a conven-
tional follow-up to one of the
least conventional pop records of
the last decade.
The album is sonically pleas-
ing from front to back, a trait I
rarely have a problem with, but
the beauty of Cody Chesnutt's
previous work comes from its
abrasiveness. Tracks like "Love
is More Than a Wedding Day"
indeed sound like the work of a
wedding band.
Even when Chesnutt takes a
chance, especially on "Under the
Spell of the Handout," a cabaret-
style call and response number,
it's far from thrilling. Landing
on a Hundred is pleasant enough
- there was just something
way more charming about the
uneven, flawed Cody Chesnutt
of old.

Rock at each home football game
- didn't boo the visiting team
during its
pregame SLIPPERY ROCK 62
introduc- MICHIGAN 100
tions. Once
play started, Michigan even let
Slippery Rock take-a lead into the
first official timeout, when the
The Rock led 9-8.
The teams traded leads for
most of the first seven minutes of
the game, but with 13:10 remain-
ing, sophomore point guard Trey
Burke's 3-pointer from the cor-
ner put Michigan ahead 17-15.
And the Wolverines never looked
back.
Though Michigan didn't look
quite like a top-five team for most
of the game, the Wolverines' tal-
ent was too much for Slippery
Rock, willing Michigan to a 100-
62 victory - the first time the
program has reached the century
mark since 2007.
Burke and the Wolverines

were never able to fully grasp
control of the opening stanza.
Though Burke scored eight first-
half points, he shot just 3-for-10
and had four turnovers, as Mich-
igan entered the locker room
with a 44-30 lead.
Junior guard Tim Hardaway
Jr., who led all players in both
first-half points and rebounds
with 12 and seven, finished with
his fourth career double-double.
Hardaway missed just two shots
and connected on all five of his
3-pointers, finishing with 25
points and 10 rebounds.
Hardaway said he had "no
idea" when the last time he shot
as well as he did Friday night.
"I don't even think one of his
threes hit the rim," Burke said.
"It was good to see, and it wasn't
even just his 3-point shooting.
"He did everything we need-
ed him to do tonight... You just
see that fire that he comes with.
When I see that, when we see
that as a team, that's when we
try to feed him."
Slippery Rock appeared to
begin the second half with
momentum, scoring on its first
two possessions to cut its defi-
cit to 10. But Hardaway lit a fire

under the Wolverines, soaring
through traffic and throwing
down a monstrous one-hand
jam. After freshman forward
Glenn Robinson III hit a jump-
er, Hardaway followed with
3-pointers on back-to-back pos-
sessions to propel Michigan to a
20-point lead.
Burke recovered from his
sluggish start, flashing his talent
that garnered pre-season All-
American accolades. The guard
finished with 21 points and eight
assists, including a loft that
Hardaway hammered home for
an alley-hoop.
"What he was trying to do -
he was really so excited to be
back out there and playing with
his. teammates (that he was)
probably going too quick," said
Michigan coach John Beilein.
"He hurried some things (but) I
loved his pace in the second half.
I don't think you'll see his five
turnovers again, but he was just
trying a little too hard."
Four freshmen saw consider-
able minutes in their first official
college game. Robinson start-
ed and flirted with a double-
double, scoring 10 points and
pulling down eight rebounds.

Guard Nik Stauskas, who was
questionable prior to game time
with a back injury, finished with
seven points, connecting on one
of his two 3-pointers. Forward
Mitch McGary finished with
nine points thanks to a couple
thunderous dunks, while also
gathering nine rebounds. Point
guard Spike Albrecht scored just
two points, and at times played
the two-guard with Burke on
the floor.
Slippery Rock made just 36.9
percent of its shots. Guard Devin
Taylor led The Rock with 14
points, and only one other scorer
reached double digits.
Twelve different Wolverines
scored, as Michigan connected*
on 66.7 percent of its shots and
7-of-9 3-pointers in the second
half.
"We've got a lot of options,"
Burke said. "Sometimes, some-
body's not hitting, another guy's
going to step up. If he's not hit-
ting, another guy's going to step
up. I just think that, with the
type of options that we have, the
biggest thing with us is that we
trust each other.
"The sky's the limit with this
team."

In just the second week of
November, the Michigan bas-
ketball team already has its first

this year are

son Square Garden-based
tournament, unlike last year
when Crisler Center played host
to the "Maui on the Mainland"
games, but Michigan was guar-
anteed a spot in Hawaii regard-
less of the games' outcomes.
Monday, the Wolverines (1-0)
face-off with the Jaguars fol-
lowing the completion of the
Falcons-Vikings game. IUPUI
(1-0) returns just two starters
from a team that finished 14-18
last year, good for seventh in
the Summit League. This year's
team was -recently tabbed to fin-
ish fifth.
The Jaguars will rely on their
backcourtcif they hope to keep up
with Michigan's potent offense.
Guard Ian Chiles, a second-team
all-conference preseason selec-
tion and guard John Hart - who
transferred from Purdue last
year after playing sparse min-
utes - will need to replace the
void left by thee-time All-Sum-
mit League guard Alex Young,
who averaged more than 20
points per game last year.
Playing at home, where the

Wolverines have won 20 of their
last 22 games dating back to
the 2010-11 season, Michigan is
expected to breeze through both
matchups as it did in Friday's
100-62 win over Slippery Rock.
Assuming the fifth-ranked
Wolverines make it out of Ann
Arbor, they'd be the favorites
heading into New York, where
Pittsburgh, Virginia and Kansas
State are expected to appear.
"We've got to go into (the
games) with a mindset (that)
everybody is ranked number
one," said junior guard Tim
Hardaway Jr. "We've got to be
on our cues because everybody's
going to give us their best game."
The games will allow the
Wolverine freshmen to get in
two final tune-ups before head-
ing into the bright lights of the
Big Apple. The lone freshman
starter, forward Glenn Robin-
son III, registered 10 points and
eight rebounds in the opener.
He has continued to impress the
Michigan coaches and his team-
mates.
"He's doing everything:
defending, getting rebounds,
boxingout," Hardaway said. "He
gets in the gym everyday. Me
and him are in the gym all the
time working on our game, get-
ting in extra reps after practice,
before practice and we do a great
job of just having fun and just
competing against one another."
Perhaps the biggest storyline
to follow is how redshirt soph-
omore forward Jon Horford
responds to increased playing
time as he's workedback into the
rotation.
Horford scored four points
and made his presence known
last Friday with a block and a
drawn charge in eight minutes -
his first game action since Dec.
10.
Though Burke said that Hor-
ford "looks one step slower than
he was before he got hurt," the
forward still gives Michigan one
more body in the front court to
provide a spark off the bench.
"He brings us energy," Hard-
away said. "We missed him out
there."

Seniors lead Blue to first win of Barnes Arico era

By DANIEL FELDMAN
Daily Sports Writer
Kim Barnes Arico finally
relaxed.
"Woo!" the first-year Michi-
gan women's basketball head
coach said at thestartofher press
conference following Michigan's
70-62 victory over Detroit at
Crisler Center in Barnes Arico's
debut. After an exhausting back-
and-forth
seod DETROIT 62
second MICHIGAN 70
half, she
took a deep
breath.
The Wolverines got off to a hot
start against the Titans thanks
to senior guards Jenny Ryan and
Kate Thompson and senior for-
ward Rachel Sheffer. The trio
combined for 52 points, with 18
apiece from Thompson and Ryan

- both career highs - and 16 by
Sheffer to go along with a career-
high 13 rebounds for her third
career double-double.
"You never know who's going
to produce on a given night,"
Ryan said. "Sometimes your
starters are going to have to
carry you. Tonight, our scorers
stepped up big."
The senior trio scored Michi-
gan's first 12 points before soph-
omore guard Nicole Elmblad
added a basket of her own at the
15:48 mark to make the score
14-6 and cause the Titans to call
their first timeout. While the
Wolverines have had a balanced
scoring attack, getting easy short
shots from underneath the bas-
ket, Detroit relied on 3-pointers
in the first half. The Titans kept
themselves in the game due to
four three-pointers by sopho-

more guard Audrey Matteson,
the last of which cut the lead
to seven. That was the closest
Detroit would make the game in
the half.
Following the basket, Michi-
gan went on a 13-2 run to lead by
18, its biggest lead of the game.
All 13 of the points in that stretch
were scored by the same trio of
seniors, including six points by
Ryan on two 3-pointers.
After being silenced in the
first half with only two points,
Detroit sophomore forward
Shareta Brown opened up the
second half with five points -
including a 3-point play to cut
the Wolverines' lead to 38-30.
Brown led the Titans with 19
"nitc n~iA;rr 7 n + -^^^-A

half, along with eight rebounds.
"I knew tonight would be a
tough task for us, just because
they are athletic and are a really
strong rebounding team," Barnes
Arico said. "So it was interesting
to see howwe wouldhandle their
pressure, and how we would
match their rebounding as well
as their inside presence with
Shareta Brown and Yar Shayov."
Barnes Arico saw how ardu-
ous that task was after Brown's
second basket in consecutive
possessions to start the second
half. After another basket by
Detroit to cut the lead six, Jenny
Ryan got the Wolverines on the
second half scoreboard with a
basket to halt the 7-0 spurt by
the Titans.

From that point forward, the
two squads traded baskets, with
the Titans continuously crashing
the boards, piling up 21 defen-
sive and 15 offensive rebounds.
In comparison, the Wolverines
managed 33 rebounds, but only
five on offense.
"Our No.1 concern on the year
is our rebounding," Barnes Arico
said. "That's something we focus
on all the time in practice. I think
we did it well in the first half. I
think when we ran out of gas, a
lot of their second chances in the
second half were off of (Brown's)
misses."
Yet, with no run bigger than
five points in the second half,,
Michigan was able to limit the
damage from Detroit out-shoot-

ing them and managed to not let
the Titans get within five points
of the lead.
The last time the Titans got
within that margin was with
34 seconds remaining to make
the score 66-61, but sophomore
guard Brenae Harris and fresh-
man guard Madison Ristovski
each made a pair of free throws
to put the game away and earn
Barnes Arico her first win at
Michigan.
"I was proud of the way we
finished up. I mean, we could
have fallen apart," Barnes Arico
said. "We kept making big plays
or free throws down the stretch.
I'm pleased, and I'm excited
to have victory number one at
home."

Michigan comeback
in overtime victory
By STEPHEN J. NESBITT
Daily Sports Editor
Thescriptwas written,proofed
and printed, but the Michigan
football teamtrashed it.

Brady Hoke waltzed into his
post-game-press conference after
the Wolverines' dramatic 38-31
overtime victory over No. 24
Northwestern at Michigan Sta-
dium.
Hoke smiled and scanned the
room. He wanted to ask the first
question.
"Who started writing the arti-
cle before the game was over?"
Hoke asked.
Several hands shot up meekly.
Michigan had no business beat-

ing the Wildcats, not the way this
one played out. The game was
all but over, but Devin Gardner
needed just eight seconds to turn
it around.
With 18 ticks left on the clock,
Gardner and the offense were on,
their own 38-yard line trailing by
three points and with no time-
outs.
Gardner, Michigan's junior.
receiver-turned-quarterback
making just his second career
start in place of injured senior

quarterback Denard Robinson,
launched a downfield strike to
fifth-year senior receiver Roy
Roundtree at the Wildcat nine-
yard line. Roundtree was beaten,
cloaked by cornerback Daniel
Jones, but Roundtree's despera-
tion attempt at the ball tipped it
away from Jones and into his own
hands as he fell to the turf.
Eight seconds changed the
entire complexion of the after-
noon.
"There was time on the clock

and the defense gave us a place to
stand," Gardner said.
The Wolverines killed the
clock with seven seconds left,
and redshirt junior kicker Bren-
dan Gibbons trotted on the field
for a game-tying 26-yard field
goal. The snap was low, but junior
receiver Drew Dileo picked it off
the carpet and Gibbons boomed it
through the uprights.
The Wolverines entered the
contest at 3-0 in home overtime
games. Hoke came in riding a

12-0 home record since arriving
at Michigan. Both streaks held, as
Gardner scampered in from one
yard out in overtime and fifth-
year senior linebacker Kenny
Demens made consecutive stops
on third and fourth down to sty-
mie the Wildcats' overtime try.
The Wolverines swarmed
straight to the student section to
celebrate the improbable victory,
one that keeps them, if only for
the time being, in line for a shot at

FOOTBALL
Roundtree bails out
Michigan once again

By ZACH HELFAND
Daily Sports Editor
The Michigan football team
had practiced this play. Thurs-
day, actually, they ran the play
they would call if they trailed
late in the game and needed a
miracle.
Junior quarterback Devin
Gardner would drop in the
pocket for as long as he could,
step up and, if it was there, heave
to fifth-year senior wide receiver

Roy Roundtree running a deep
post route. Roundtree would be
the deep man. The target.
He'd just need to go up and
get it.
They practiced that play for
the same situation Michigan
faced Saturday, Gardner said,
trailingby three points to North-
western with just 18 seconds to
go. Michigan needed a miracle.
Before the play, Roundtree
found his quarterback.
"I told (Gardner), like, 'Just

put it up there. I'm gonna get it,'
" Roundtree said.
It wasn't a demand. But for
Roundtree, that's about as close
as it gets.e
Roundtree has plodded
through much of this season
with little to show for it. He
entered Saturday's game with
just 15 receptions for 239 yards
- hardly the numbers of a No. 1
receiver.
For a while, there hadn't been

Michigan splits series,
with Michigan State

By MATT SLOVIN
Daily Sports Editor
EAST LANSING - Friday
night, the Michigan hockey team
embarrassed Michigan State,
5-1, in the two teams' first meet-
ing of the season.
But
when the MICH.STATE 1
Wolver- MICHIGAN 5
ines found MICHIGAN 2
themselves MICH. STATE 7
trailing 3-0
just 6:49 into the opening frame
of Saturday's series finale, it was
evident that they'd be the ones
getting outworked, and they
eventually fell, 7-2.
"You knew they would come

out harder and play better, but I
didn't know that we would come
out so poorly," said Michigan
coach Red Berenson.
Unlike the series opener,
when the Wolverines built an
early lead, the Spartans wasted
no time showing Saturday would
have a different feel to it. Just
34 seconds into the game, Spar-
tan forward Matt Berry found
himself with the puck all alone
in front of Michigan goaltender
Jared Rutledge. Berry managed
a couple dekes to keep Rutledge
guessing, before roofing the puck
for the openingtally.
It was a swift opening state-
ment, a crowd-igniting tally that
sent a message to Rutledge, who

started both games of the series,
and the Michigan defense that
they weren't leaving with a win.
But it wasn't enough for Mich-
igan State - the Spartans contin-
ued to set the pace, playing most
of the first period in the Michi-
gan zone.
The deficit doubled to 2-0
when Spartan forward Brent
Darnell tapped in a puck right
after a 5-on-3 power play expired
that Rutledge couldn't quite
reach across the crease.
Before the PA announcer at
Munn Ice Arena could announce
the second tally, Michigan State

The Big House magic

Stachel, Ezurike cap
dramatic OT victory

T here's something to that
Big House magic.
Brady Hoke must
believe it by now. The Michigan
football team scraped together an
impossible 38-31 overtime victory
over Northwestern on Saturday
in the hallowed confines of Mich-
igan Stadium.
It pushed
Hoke's home --
record to a
perfect 13-0
since he took
over as the
Wolverines'
head coach
prior to the
2011 season. STEPHEN J.-
Those wins NESBITT
include some
last-second r
thrillers like Denard Robinson-
to-Roy Roundtree to beat Notre
Dame and Brendan Gibbons from
38 to topple Michigan State. And
now it includes Roundtree and
the desperation tip against the
Wildacts to snatch victory from
the sure clutches of defeat.
But let's go back further, back
to Hoke's earlier stint at Michi-
gan. With Hoke on the Michigan
sideline, the Wolverines are 58-6
at the Big House. And that track
record is littered with classics.
But it all goes back to one'
game, Hoke's first loss at Michi-
gan and the bitter taste of defeat.
That first one added a personal
touch to Saturday's game.
The last time Brady Hoke and
Northwestern coach Pat Fitzger-
ald were at Michigan Stadium
together was Oct. 7, 1995.
Hoke was a first-year defensive
line coach on the home sideline.
Fitzgerald was Northwestern's
burly junior middle linebacker,
wearing a white No. 51 jersey and
terrorizing Michigan quarter-
back Brian Griese.
With the Wildcats leading
19-13 and just 1:40 remaining

yard line, the Big House magic
was alive. Fitzgerald, vwho was
jumping up and down just a few
minutes earlier, bolted down the
visitor sideline. He would have
strapped on pads and finished
the game if he could. The script
mostly played out the same way '
as it did in 1995 defeat, but sud-
denlythe roles were reversed.
"Big players make big plays in
big situations," Griese crowed.
after Roundtree's catch. He knew
all about that formula. But Griese
forgot to add another "big" into
the equation: the Big House.
There was an electricity in
the air as the clock wound down
and overtime loomed. There's
something about the 12th man
at Michigan Stadium that makes
opponents, even smart ones, do
some stupid things.
Like Charlie Weis throwing
instead of running out the clock
in 2009. Tommy Rees fumbling
and bumbling the ball back to
Michigan last fall. And Fitzgerald
calling a rugby punt to Jeremy
Gallon instead of putting the
punt out of bounds, setting up the
pass to Roundtree on Saturday.
And Griese forgot the big man
on the Michigan sideline - Hoke.
Fitzgerald and the Wildcats
taught Hoke that sting of defeat
once, and he wouldn't let it hap-
pen again, even 17 years later. As
Hoke made his way through a sea
of players toward the Michigan
tunnel, he wore a wry smile.
"Did you know you were going
to win?" his wife, Laura, asked.
"Yes," he said, without a trace
of doubt.
With 112,000 strong at his
back, he's seen the pitfalls, he's
seen the most improbable tri-
umphs. He's got a .906 lifetime
record at Michigan Stadium -
.770 away from home. That man
doesn't lose at Michigan Stadium.
Perhaps he's learned of that
Big House magic.

Facing NCAA Tournament
elimination and the end of her
collegiate career, senior mid-
fielder Clare Stachel took matters
into her own hands on Saturday
night. Her spectacular header
with less than a minute remaining
in regula-.
tion helped C. MICHIGAN 1
propel the MICHIGAN 2
Michigan
women's soccer team to a 2-1 vic-
tory over Central Michigan at the
U-M Soccer Complex.
The Wolverines (8-3-2 Big Ten,
15-5-2 overall) tested the Chip-
pewas early in the match, earning
two corner kicks in the first two
minutes. But it was Central Michi-
gan (9-2 Mid-American Confer-
ence, 15-7-1) which drew first
blood on its first offensive oppor-
tunity just three minutes into the
contest. Central Michigan defend-
er Bailey Brandon took a long
throw-in into Michigan's 18-yard
box, and forward Laura Gosse
managed to one-touch a shot past
Michigan senior goalkeeper Haley
Kopmeyer. Gosse's fifth goal of
the season gave the Chippewas an
early advantage.
Gosse's tally almost proved to
be the game-winner for Central
Michigan, as the Wolverines time
and again couldn't find the back of
the net. In the 24th minute, junior
forward Nkem Ezurike passed
a ball between a defender's legs
to midfielder Cassie Collins. The
freshman had an open look at goal
from the penalty spot, but fired
a shot off the post. Five minutes
later, junior midfielder Meghan
Toohey's header rattled the cross-
bar. And midway through the
second half, Ezurike had an oppor-
tunity alone against the goalkeep-
er but also hit the post.
In the 89th minute, Stachel
shook the woodwork once more.
But unlike so many prior oppor-
tunities, the ball deflected in.

Sprinting towards the net and
being defended closely by a Chip-
pewa, Stachel headed a long pass
just enough to beat goalkeeper
Stefanie Turner. The shot rang off
the top corner of the goal frame
and bounced beyond the end line,
pulling the Wolverines even with
40 seconds remaining. It was Sta-
chel's first goal of the season and a
perfect finish for the senior play-
ing her last game at the U-M Soc-
cer Complex.
"Coming into my senior year
I wanted to contribute the most I
could for this team," Stachel said.
"I wanted to leave my mark."
Riding the momentum from
Stachel's dramatic tally, Michigan
won the game handily in overtime.
The Wolverines took four shots
in the extra period and found the
back of the net in less than five
minutes. Senior midfielder Emily
Jaffe - who had been rejected on a
beautiful save by Turner moments
earlier - fired a low shot towards
goal. The ball deflected off a
defender to Ezurike, who tapped
it past Turner for her 14th goal of
the season.
"It was (Jaffe's) hard work that
got the goal," Ezurike said. "It was
an easy tap in, butshe did the hard
work."
After Ezurike's tally, the Wol-
verines poured onto the field,
dancing and hugging. Near the
visitor's bench, several Chippewa
players silently fought back tears.
Though the Wolverines strug-
gled to capitalize on their early
opportunities, Ryan did not mod-
ify his attacking strategy, hoping
the tying goal would come.
"That was awfully late to put
it away," he said. "Some days you
wonder, 'Is this just not your day?'
Usually you don't win on days like
today."
But Michigan scored just in
time and advanced to the second
round of the NCAA Tournament
where it will face fourth-seeded
Portland in State College, Pa. on
Friday.

Freshman tackle Ondre Pipkins celebrates yet another victory at home

on the clock, Griese and the
Michigan offense were 41 yards
from the end zone facing a third-
and-15. Fitzgerald had ended the
previous drive by tipping a pass
out of harm's way.
Fitzgerald, crouched four
yards off the line of scrimmage,
started slowly off the snap. He
waited for a crease, then burst
through it. He had a clean shot at
Griese as soon as the quarterback
finished his seven-step drop. The
pass fell more than a few yards
short of its intended target in the
flat.
"Brian Griese is trying to
shake the cobwebs right now,"
said play-by-play announcer Brad
Nessler. "It's fourth down."
Last chance. Northwestern
didn't change a thing. Fitzgerald
and Hudhaifa Ismaeli shot the
same gap on a delayed blitz and
Fitzgerald was free again. Seven

steps. Boom.
Griese got rid of the ball again,
but it was a lame duck. Defensive
back William Bennett dove to
make the interception, though he
could have just let it fall.
"Griese still down. Fitzgerald
hit him again," Nessler said.
Fitzgerald reached down and
swung the quarterback back
onto his feet. The day belonged
to Fitzgerald, the hero, walking
to the sideline with his fist raised'
high.
They were all back on Satur-
day. The roles were just different.
Hoke was on one sideline,
Fitzgerald on the other. Griese,
now a color analyst for ESPN,
was in the booth.

his miraculous catch at the nine-

Boo Nieves finally got the
Wolverines on the board dur-

period.
In rapid succession, fresh-

and junior forward Luke Moffatt
missed shots from the bottom of
the slot, only to have the puck
skirt out to Nieves who eagerly
slammed it home to cut into the
deficit.
Berry scored his second of the

In the second period, Michi-

"When I'm looking at them
on the sideline, there was never

said.
An air of despair swirled
around the Michigan football
team's fan base a week ago when
it was announced that Robinson,'
recovering from an ulnar-nerve
injury, wouldn't start against
Minnesota. Gardner shifted
back to quarterback and led the
Wolverines to a 35-13 victory.
When the same announce-
ment was made on Saturday
prior to Michigan's kickoff

were few reservations. And
Gardner didn't disappoint.

well," Hoke said. "He made some

The narrative that held for
much of the game, though, was
Michigan's inability to slow
down the Northwestern offense.
Northwestern quickly proved
to be a formidable foe on Satur-
day. After tailback Venric Mark
gave the Wildcats an early lead,
Northwestern quarterbacks

continued to attack with up-
the-gut plunges from Mark and

quarter, Northwestern tied it up

and didn't slow down. In the first
drive of the second half, Colter
found receiver Dan Vitale for a
quick-strike touchdown.
And just when it looked like
the Wildcats would do it again,
Michigan finally made its stand.
It was just enough.

end Craig Roh exploded into the
backfield to sack Colter and force
a short field goal, keeping Michi-
gan within 10 points.
"Had that not happened and
they went gone in and scored
seven ... the outcome (of the
game) probably would have been
different," Demens said.
Gardner took to the air, draw-
ing a defensive pass interference
and then hitting junior receiver
Jeremy Gallon streaking down
the right side for a gain of 42
yards. The next play, Toussaint
took a dump pass from Gardner,
slipped a tackle and tip-toed

touchdown.
Michigan got the ball back at
its own eight-yard line, trailing
24-21 early in the fourth quarter,
and Gardner wasted no time in
the shadows of his own end zone.
He found Roundtree twice, Gal-
lon once and Dileo once to put

Michigan State added one
more on a goal from senior for-
ward Kevin Walrod to close out
the scoring and seal the 7-2 blow-

Berenson opted to ride the hot
hand, but Rutledge, and the

down pass to take a 31-28 lead
with just under four minutes left
in the game. But Gardner would
give the ball right back on the
next snap by throwing a long
interception.
The Wildcats couldn't quite
run out the clock, and that
doomed them. Michigan got the
ball back with 18 seconds and the
Hail Mary to Roundtree set up
the game-tying kick.
In the end, Gardner shared the
spotlight with Roundtree. The
much-maligned receiver, who
toppled Notre Dame in the final
seconds last fall, played hero
again. He made five catches for
139 yards.
Maybe the script was right all
along. It just depends who was
writing it.
As he walked with his wife,
Laura, into the bowels of Michi-
gan Stadium, she turned to him.
"Did you know you were going
to win?" she asked?
"Yes," Hoke said.
Hoke never had a doubt.
"No way," the second-year
coach said.
And why's that?
"Because of those kids."

GARDNER
From Page 1B
so I can't blame you guys for not
knowing."
Indeed, Gardner has
impressed in his first two starts
this season, and he has put fans'
minds at ease in Robinson's
absence, especially after redshirt
freshman Russell Bellomy's mis-
erable performance when he ini-
tially replaced Robinson in the
Nebraska game a couple weeks
ago.
Gardner said that he had full
confidence in the offense at the
end of the game when it got the
ball back with 18 seconds left
in regulation and needed three
points to tie.
"There's no option but to go
score," Gardner said. "We've
worked way to hard to this
point to not get the score. We
have time on the clock, and the
defense gave us a place to stand.
(Fifth-year senior cornerback
J.T. Floyd) told me, he said, 'We
gave you a chance, so let's go.
Let's get the touchdown."'
Michigan wound up settling
for a field goal, but he was enough
to extend the contest and even-
tually win in overtime, 38-31.
In a good mood from the win,
Gardner fooled around with the
media. When one reporter asked
fifth-year senior Roy Roundtree
whether the Wildcat defensive
back tipped the pass that he
caught to set up the game-tying
field goal, Gardner chimed in,
"Hey, that's neither here nor
there."
KOVACS HONORED WITH
LEGEND PATCH: Prior to kickoff,
Kovacs was announced as the
newest recipient of a Michigan
Football Legend patch, and he
will wear No. 11 for the remain-
der of his career.
"I've worn No. 32 for quite
some time, I think I'll always be
"I think I'll
always be
No. 32."
No. 32," Kovacs said. "ButI think
it's a great opportunity to recog-
nize our legends."
The No. 11 jersey was worn by
the Wistert brothers - Francis,
Albert and Alvin - for different
Michigan teams beginning in
1931.
The eldest, Francis, played on
back-to-back national champi-
onship squads, and he was also
a Big Ten MVP for the Michigan
baseball team.
Francis later played for the
Cincinnati Reds before coming
back to Ann Arbor to be an assis-
tant football coach.
The middle brother, Albert,
played from 1940-42 for head
coach Fritz Crisler, and he went
on to be a decorated offen-
sive tackle for the Philadelphia
Eagles in the NFL.
"I actually had the opportu-
nity to meet Albert yesterday,
and he said that when he was
first given 11, he was so humbled,
and he was so excited and it was
a huge honor for him," Kovacs
said. "He prayed before every

game that he put it on that he'd
be worthy enough to wear it. So
that's kind of my approach."
The youngest brother was
Alvin, who played defensive
tackle for' the Wolverines at
age 30 after serving in the U.S.
Marine Corps in World War II.
He was an All-American in 1948
and 1949.


ROUNDTREE
From Page 1B
much progression at all. The
coaches have continually praised
Roundtree's attitude and down-
field blocking, but as a receiver,
Roundtree sputtered then stag-
nated. It took him three games
to find the end zone, and com-
ing into Saturday's game, he had
gone another six weeks without
scoring. It took him five weeks to
reach 10 total receptions. It took
him an additional week to break
100 total yards for the season.
Freshman tight end Devin
Funchess had been a more pre-
ferred target. Redshirt junior
receiver Jeremy Gallon was the
main threat for several games.
Drew Dileo hauled in more cru-
cial receptions than Roundtree.
Even Gardner himself was more
impactful before he moved back
to quarterback last week.
Though Roundtree remained
the No. 1 receiver, he never com-
manded attention. Perpetually
laid back, perpetually smiling, he
never demanded the ball.
Then senior quarterback
Denard Robinson got injured
against Nebraska two weeks ago.
Gardner, who just one week prior
had been a member of the receiv-
ing corps with Roundtree, would
need to convert back to quarter-
back against Minnesota. That
left Michigan without one of its
better targets, and there was
almost no semblance of a run-
ninggame to rely on.
But against the Golden
Gophers, Roundtree baileddout
Gardner on a long heave, a diffi-
cult catch in double-coverage
Against Northwestern this
week, Roundtree said, "I told
(Gardner) all game, just put the
ball up there and I'm gonna go
get it for you."

Roundtree finished the first
half with just one reception,
but the long catch and run set
Michigan up on Northwestern's
29-yard line. Then, Roundtree
drew a pass interference penalty
in the end zone, which led to a
Michigan touchdown.
After a quiet third quarter,
Roundtree caught four passes for
107 yards in the fourth quarter
and overtime. Two receptions
on a drive in the fourth quar-
ter ultimately led to a Michi-
gan touchdown. On that drive,
Roundtree made a tiptoe grab
near the Michigan sideline. At
other times, he attacked the ball,
beating defensive backs on 50-50
throws.
"Roy really, I think on a couple
balls today, really had great focus
and great intensity in what he
was doing," said Michigan coach
Brady Hoke.

Roundtree finished with five
receptions for 139 yards. It was
his first 100-yard receiving game
since 2010 and his most yardage
since Nov. 6 of that year, when
he recorded 246 yards in a slug-
fest against Illinois. For Michi-
gan, Roundtree was the first
receiver to break the 100-yard
plateau since Gallon in week one.
(Funchess, the tight end, also
broke 100 yards in week two).
But after a Northwestern
touchdown and a Gardner inter-
ception in the fourth quarter,
the Michigan offense had time
for only one or two heaves. The
Wolverines took over from their
own 38 with 18 second remain-
ing. They knew which play they
would run. Gardner chucked and
Roundtree waited.
After Roundtree's catch, the
Michigan sideline would erupt.
Roundtree's teammates would

sprint to the line to spike the ball,
as Funchess dove across the side-
line to get off the field in time.
Dileo would salvage a bad snap to
get a good hold for the tying field
goal.
In overtime, Roundtree would
have another big reception, and
Michigan would win, 38-31. His
teammates would tackle each
other in the end zone and chase
each other in celebration and
Robinson would search the field
for Roundtree yelling "Tree!"
and smiling wide.
But in the moment as the ball
came closer, Roundtree had a
defender draped over his back.
He jumped, received a bump and
tipped the ball up. As Roundtree
fell, the ball did too.
Roundtree attacked it.
"My mind said, 'I gotta go up
and make this play,' " Roundtree
said.
