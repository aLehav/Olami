Interim policy
created to follow
federal guidelines
By HALEY GOLDBERG
Daily Staff Reporter
The University announced a
new interim procedure for han-
dling allegations of sexual mis-
conduct this week.
In an e-mail sent to the cam-
pus community on Tuesday, E.
Royster Harper, the Univer-
sity's vice president for student
affairs, and Suellyn Scarnec-
chia, the University's vice
president and general counsel,
announced temporary measures
thatlower the required standard
of evidence needed to report an
alleged incident of sexual mis-
conduct.
University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald said the interim pro-
cedure was developed during
the summer after a letter was
issued by the U.S. Department
of Education in April to all fed-
erally funded universities in

regard to how they address sex-
ual misconduct allegations.
"It was based on that addi-
tional guidance from the
Department of Education that
the interim policy was sort of
developed over the summer and
put in place to maintain the Uni-
versity's compliance with those
Title IX regulations," Fitzgerald
said.
The main change in the pro-
cedure isthe amount of evidence
needed when addressing a claim
of sexual misconduct. Before,
students needed to provide
"clear and convincing evidence"
that an incident occurred. Now,
students only need to meet the
standard of a "preponderance
of evidence" to corroborate the
allegation.
According to the guidelines
established by the Depart-
ment of Education, a prepon-
derance of evidence is when
"it is more likely than not that
sexual harassment or violence
occurred." Clear and convincing
evidence, meanwhile, is defined
as a situation where "it is highly

Hundreds gather at
local event to talk
economic disparity
By ANDREW SCHULMAN
Daily StaffReporter
In the middle of Occupy Ann
Arbor's assembly on the Diag
last night, University alum Matt
Bussey asked the crowd of about

200 students and Ann Arbor
residents to take out their cell
phones and call U.S. Rep. John
Dingell (D-Mich.).
Bussey told the crowd that
Dingell and other government
officials need to be more con-
scious of their constituents who
aren't in the highest income
brackets. Though few people
appeared to heed his suggestion
to call Dingell, Bussey's request
reflected several key topics dis-

cussed duringthe event.
Attendees and leaders of
the Occupy Ann Arbor event
focused on their desire to curb
corporate power and stand up
for the rights of the working
and middle classes. Occupy Ann
Arbor is a local offshoot of the
Occupy Wall Street movement
that began in New York last
month in protest of the nation's
economic conditions and the
influence of corporate America

on politics.
Bussey, who graduated from
the Rackham Graduate School
last December, was one of about
20 speakers who decried the
nation's political and economic
state. In addition to discussing
income inequality and corpo-
rate greed, the speakers talked
about major U.S. banks, the
University's handling of con-
tract negotiations with nurses

SPRING COMMENCEMENT 2012
Petition calls for Tina Fey
for 'U' graduation speaker

ACADEMIC ACTING

More than 980
students sign
petition supporting
comedian
By TAYLOR WIZNER
For the Daily
A new name has entered the
ring in the battle for the Univer-
sity's Spring Commencement
2012 speaker.
A student-led petition that
calls for actress and comedi-

an Tina Fey to be the keynote
speaker has been circulating on
campus. The petition, in compe-
tition with another for Facebook
founder Mark Zuckerberg to be
the speaker, has amassed more
than 980 signatures since it was
started on Sunday.
LSA senior Jessica Kurs-
man, who started the petition,
said she'd like to see Fey deliver
the commencement address
because of her accomplishments
and humor.
"I chose Tina Fey because she
has broken a lot of gender barri-
ers, and I thought that she could

produce a pretty well written as
well as funny speech," Kursman
said.
Kursman is in the process of
submitting a formal application
to nominate Fey as the speaker.
She said another reason she
wants Fey to deliver the gradua-
tion address is because she'd like
to have a female commencement
speaker. The University has not
had a female keynote speaker
for the Spring Commencement
ceremony since 2006 when
journalist Christiane Amanpour
gave the address.

Fetchnotes app
intended for
personal, group use
By PATRICIA SNIDER
Daily StaffReporter
For two University students,
taking notes on paper and lap-
tops have become an antiquated
from of academic engagement.

Instead of using existing
forms of note-taking like the
fast fleeting pen and paper,
and Microsoft Word, Business
juniors Alex Schiff and Chase
Lee are hoping their new start-
up, Fetchnotes, will become
the standard for documenting
information in lectures as well
as personal reminders and com-
municating with others.
Fetchnotes, a note-taking
application designed by Schiff

and Lee after they took an
entrepreneurship class at the
University, enables users to cre-
ate, send and receive notes. It
is available as a desktop, Inter-
net and cell phone application
and will be released later this
month.
The mission of Fetchnotes
is to provide an efficient note-
taking application for users
that minimizes complexity -

Police deputies kill accused

Shooter killed
three, wounded six
at limestone quarry
SUNNYVALE, Calif. (AP) -A
man believed to be the disgrun-
tled employee accused of open-
ing fire on his co-workers at a
California limestone quarry was
shot and killed by deputies yes-
terday, authorities said.
Three deputies on routine
patrol in a Sunnyvale neigh-
borhood encountered the man
matching Shareef Allman's
description around 7:30 a.m.,
Santa Clara County Sheriff Lau-
rie Smith said. He was crouched
behind a vehicle in the driveway
of a home.
The deputies opened fire after
the man "displayed in a threat-
ening manner his firearm,"
Smith said.
Investigators believe the man
is Allman, but the coroner will
have to confirm the identity, she
said.
"I'm glad that we were able to

reach a resolution. It's unfortu-
nate that an additional person
died, but it's over, and my con-
cern is the public safety of the
county," Smith said.
Authorities did not immedi-
ately release the names of depu-
ties - two men and one woman
- who all had less than five
years with the agency. Smith
praised their work, saying they
"did a great job at the scene."
The shooting took place in
a residential neighborhood
about 5 miles east of the Lehigh
Southwest Cement Permanente
Plant, where Allman allegedly
opened fire during a routine
safety meeting a day earlier.
Three people died and six were
wounded.
Authorities believe All-
man also shot a woman in an
attempted carjacking a couple
of hours after fleeing the quarry.
yesterday's encounter with law
enforcement took place about a
block from that carjacking, near
Hewlett-Packard Co.'s Cuper-
tino campus.
Allison Moorwood, who

lives near the scene of Thurs-
day's shooting, said authorities
scoured the area the previous
day in search of Allman.
"We were in the house lock-
down all day yesterday," Moor-
wood said. "We've never seen
anything like it in our neighbor-
hood."
"The SWAT stormed in like
ninjas, and they took a posi-
tion in our front bedroom," said
another neighbor, Jenny Mar-
tin.
According to authorities, All-
man became upset Wednesday
during the meeting at the quar-
ry. He left briefly and returned
with a handgun and rifle and
started shooting people, Santa
Clara County sheriff's Lt. Rick
Sung said. About 15 workers
were at the meeting.
The dead were identified as
Manuel Pinon, 48, of Newman,
Calif., and John Vallejos, 51 and
Mark Munoz, 59, both of San
Jose. Six others at the quarry
were wounded and taken to hos-
pitals, where some were in criti-
cal condition, Smith said.
Later Wednesday morn-
ing, authorities received a 911
call reporting an attempted
carjacking by a man match-
ing Allman's description. The
shooter fled on foot after using
a weapon similar to a gun used
in the quarry shooting, authori-
ties said.
The carjacking victim, a
Hewlett-Packard contract
employee, was in fair condition
at Santa Clara Valley Medical
Center, hospital spokeswoman
Joy Alexiou said.
She said a quarry shoot-
ing victim was listed there in
good condition Thursday, and
another victim was treated
and released shortly after the
shooting.
During the ensuing manhunt
for Allman, schools were locked
down in Cupertino, home of
Apple Inc., and in nearby com-
munities. Authorities went
door to door with guns drawn
and residents were warned to
stay indoors.

President
challenges GOP to
support jobs plan
WASHINGTON (AP) - Defi-
ant and frustrated, President
Barack Obama aggressively chal-
lenged Republicans yesterday
to get behind his jobs plan or
explain why not, declaring that if
Congress fails to act "the Ameri-
can people will run them out of
town."
The president used a White
House news conference to
attempt to heighten the pressure
he's sought to create on the GOP
by traveling around the country,
into swing states and onto the
home turf of key Republican foes
including House Speaker John
Boehner and Texas Gov. Rick
Perry.
Giving a bit of ground on his
own plan, he endorsed a new pro-
posal by Senate Democrats to tax
millionaires to pay for his jobs
program. "This is not a game,"
he said.
Obama made no apologies for
his decision to abandon seeking

compromise with Republicans
in favor of assailing them, some-
times by name. He contended
that he'd gone out of his way to
try to work with the GOP since
becoming president, reaching
hard-fought deals to raise the
government's borrowing limit
and avert a government shut-
down, and had gotten nothing in
return.
"Each time, what we have seen
is games playing," the president
said. "I am always open to nego-
tiations. What is also true is they
need to do something."
Obama was still at the lectern
when Senate Majority Leader
Harry Reid told Republicans he
would permit a test vote as early
as late Wednesday on the presi-
dent's original measure. There
was little doubt it would fail, the
outcome Republicans hoped for.
The president predicted dire
political consequences for his
opponents if they don't go along.
"I think the American people
will run them out of town because
they are frustrated and they know
we need to do something big,
somethingbold."
"We will just keep on going

at it and hammering away until
something gets done," he said.
"And I would love nothing more
than to see Congress act so
aggressively that I can't cam-
paign against them as a do-noth-
ing Congress."
Yet Obama's campaign has not
swayed Capitol Hill Republicans
who oppose the higher taxes
he and other Democrats want
to use to pay for his proposal.
They accuse Obama of playing
"campaigner in chief" instead of
working with them.
"If the goal is to create jobs,
then why are we even talking
about tax hikes?" Senate Minor-
ity leader Mitch McConnell,
R-Ky., said Wednesday.
Republicans are resolutely
opposed to much of Obama's jobs
initiative, both for its tax increas-
es for wealthier people and small
businesses andits repriseofstim-
ulus spending on roads, bridges
and schools and grants to local
governments to pay the salaries
of teachers and first responders.
They criticize his bill as another
version of his $825 billion stimu-
lus of 2009, one that this time
would rely on raising taxes.

Israelis remember
Babi Yar massacre
With tears in his eyes, Michael
Sidko laid a wreath of flowers at
Israel's official Holocaust memo-

yesterdaymarking70years since a
World War II massacre he barely
escaped.
Sidko was six when he was
taken with his family to the Babi
Yar ravine outside Kiev, Ukraine
- then part of the Soviet Union
- to be murdered along with
the rest of that city's Jews. In
the two-day killing spree in Sep-
tember 1941, Nazi troops gunned
down more than 33,000 Jews and
buried them in mounds of dirt.
Among those murdered were
Sidko's mother and two of his sib-
lings. He and his older brother,
Grisha, were among the few who
managed to escape the killing
fields.
"How is it that everyone was
killed and only we survived?" he
asked, hands quivering. "I still
can't believe what happened there
and how I managed to get away. I
thank God I am here today."
At 76, he is one of the only living
survivors of an atrocity that has
become one of the defining events
of the Nazi genocide of 6 million
Jews.

Online estimator
helps students plan
education budgets
It sounds likea simple question:
How much is a college actually
goingto cost?
In fact, it's a slippery one. But
thanks to a federal mandate, a new
tool to help students and fami-
lies pin down an answer is finally
arriving this month: a fairly simple
online calculator to estimate what
you can expect to payto attend any
college in the United States.
The new "net price calculators"
- manyalreadyup and running on
college websites ahead of the Oct.
29 legal deadline - are designed
to provide the non-binding cost
estimatesbased on afew relatively
straightforward questions about
family finances.
More broadly, they're supposed
to help students navigate one ofthe
most confusing aspects of the col-
lege matchmaking process. While
a school's "list price" is usually
easy enough to identify, students
often don't hear until long after
they've applied and gotten accep-
tance letters what will be their
"net price" - the sometimes sub-
stantially lower cost after scholar-
ships and discounts are applied.
Now colleges are obliged to
make the estimating calculators
publicly available on their web-
sites. Supporters predict two main
effects, both positive. Some fami-
lies may be surprised how much
college will still cost them, but at
least they'll know more accurately
which schools are affordable, and
how much they need to save.

Other families, meanwhile,
may be pleasantly surprised by
the discounts, and won't cross off
potential matches for fear they're
unaffordable.
That could lead to more stu-
dents considering high-priced pri-
vate institutions where applicants
are often scared off by sticker
price shock.
"For those of us who are higher
cost, we get ruled out right off the
bat," said Linda Parker, director
of financial aid at Union College
in New York, which has had its
version of the net-price calcula-
tor running on its website since
January. "When they find out we
have pretty generous scholarships
we offer, and we meet full demon-
strated need for the students we
admit, it's not out of their reach."
At private, nonprofit four-year
colleges, the most recent College
Board annual survey reported
published tuition and fees: aver-
aged $27,293. That's expensive, to
be sure. But fewer people realize
full-time students at those schools
receive grant aid and tax breaks
totaling on average $16,000. The
average net cost of attending pri-
vate colleges has actually declined
over the last five years.
Take the example of a fic-
tional Massachusetts family, the
Medians, choosing between the
University of Massachusetts at
Amherst, the state's public flag-
ship institution, or to Amherst
College, an elite private liberal
arts school two miles down North
Pleasant Street. Amherst College
has much higher prices but also
a 10-figure endowment and sub-
stantial financial aid to spread
over its small student body.

Detroit Tigers
vying for first
World Series title
since 1984
NEW YORK (AP) - The
Detroit Tigers survived a tense
trip back to Bronx, with Jose Val-
verde and the bullpen holding on
time and time again to beat the
New York Yankees 3-2 last night
to win the deciding Game 5 of
their AL playoff series.
Don Kelly and Delmon Young
hit consecutive home runs in the
first inning, then Doug Fister
and the Tigers spent the rest of a
thrilling game tryingto preserve
their lead.
They did - barely - and
advanced to the AL champion-
ship series against Texas.
"It was a gutsy win, especially
with all the opportunities they
had," Kelly said.
Joaquin Benoit followed
Max Scherzer in the seventh
and walked Mark Teixeira with
the bases loaded, pulling the
Yankees within a run. Benoit
struck out Nick Swisher with
a 95 mph fastball to keep the
lead.
Then in the eighth, Brett
Gardner singled with two outs

before Derek Jeter flied out to
Kelly just in front of the right-
field wall.
Valverde finished with the
only 1-2-3 inning for Detroit
after the first, getting his second
save of the series and remaining
perfect in 51 chances this year.
After Valverde struck out Alex
Rodriguez to end it, the Tigers'
closer crouched and pumped
both arms as his teammates ran
out to celebrate.
"The Yankees are so good that
I would be lying if I said it didn't
give me a little extra satisfaction
to be able to do it here in the fifth
game," Tigers manager Jim Ley-
land said. "This will be a game
I'll remember for the rest of my
life."
While the Yankees were elim-
inated in the postseason with a
one-run loss at home for the first
time since the 1926 World Series
against St. Louis, Detroit won an
all-or-nothing postseason game
for the first time since beating
the Cardinals in Game 7 of the
1968 World Series.
With the Tigers vying for
their first World Series title since
1984, ace Justin Verlander will
start the ALCS opener at Texas
on Saturday night against the
Rangers' C.J. Wilson. This will
be Detroit's first trip to the ALCS
since 2006.

Before a new Yankee Stadium
record crowd of 50,960, New
York had its chances, but the
Yankees went 2 for 9 with run-
ners in scoring position and 0 for
4 with the bases loaded, and they
stranded 10 runners.
While the Yankees led the AL
with 97 wins during the regular
season, the early exit in the first
round and second straight sea-
son without a World Series title
will set off a restless offseason
search for more starting pitch-
ing and offense.
Rodriguez was 0 for 4 with
three strikeouts and hit .118 in
the series (2 for 18) and Teixeira
batted .167 (3 for 18). Robinson
Cano, whose fifth-inning solo
homer started the comeback
attempt, was the Yankees' pri-
mary offense with nine RBIs.
Kelly and Young homered on
the sixth and seventh pitches
from Ivan Nova, the Game 1win-
ner who led rookies with 16 wins
during the regular season and
hadn't loss in the majors since
June 3.
The homers were the first
back-to-back postseason shots
in Tigers' history, and it was
the third homer of the series for
Young, who was acquired from
Minnesota on Aug. 15. Kelly
was a surprise starter at third to
some.

Unseasonably warm
weather, field fires
threaten fall harvest


Farmers in take
precautions to
protect crops
LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) - Farm-
ers usually hope for sunny
weather to help speed their har-
vest, but weeks of unseasonably
warm temperatures have dra-
matically increased the risk of
field fires, prompting growers to
take extra precautions as they
navigate equipment through dry
crops.
Thousands of acres of farm-
land already have caught fire
recently, including giant blazes
this week in central Nebraska
and south-central South Dako-
ta.
The National Weather Service
has issued "red flag warnings"
for firefighters and land manage-
ment agents in Minnesota, Iowa,
Nebraska, Kansas, western Mis-
souri, eastern Colorado, North
Dakota and South Dakota. The
warning indicates a heightened
fire danger in those regions.
"It's not unusual to have some
fires this time of year," said
Denny Gorton, president of the
South Dakota Firefighters Asso-
ciation. "But to have this many
fires, of this size, with thousands
and thousands of acres burning
- that's extremely unusual."
Although a little rain is pos-
sible this weekend, the weather
is expected to remain warm.
The dry weather also means
the moisture content of corn

and soybeans in many areas is
far less than ideal, and unless it
improves farmers will be paid
less for their crops.
Regardless of the conditions,
farmers have little choice but
to begin harvesting when their
corn, soybeans or other crops are
ready.
Bruce Rowher, who grows
corn and soybean near the
northwest Iowa town of Paul-
lina, said he narrowly avoided a
fire recently on his property.
"I saw what looked like dust
blowing across the field and then
realized the dust started at a
point in the middle of the field so
I got out there and found embers
trying to ignite," he said.
Rowher, 59, said it appeared
some wires on his combine
shorted out and heated up dust
that had accumulated on the
machine. Rowher, who keeps a
fire extinguisher, water and a
shovel on his combine, managed
to douse the embers before they
could flame up.
"If I hadn't been looking and
been in the right place at the
right time it could have had a
different result," Rowher said
Thursday, as he was finishing
up harvesting 500 acres of soy-
beans.
Earl Ziegler, a 62-year-old soy-
bean famer from southern Min-
nesota, said this year is the worst
he's seen for fires. He knows of
six fires in his county alone. He
said all farmers can do to reduce
the risk is to check their equip-
ment closely.

Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi fans his face during the Forum of Kings, Princes, Sultans, Sheikhs and Mayors of
Africa in Tripoli on Sept. 82010.
Gadhafi rallies Libyans to
disobey new government

Former Libyan
leader makes
his first public
remarks in weeks
TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) -
Moammar Gadhafi called on
Libyans to take to the streets
and wage a campaign of civil
disobedience against the coun-
try's new leaders yesterday -
the first word from the fugitive
leader in just over two weeks.
Gadhafi said the National
Transitional Council, which
has assumed leadership of
the country since then-rebel
forces swept into Tripoli in
late August, has no legitimacy
because it was not nominated
or appointed by the Libyan
people.
He called on his countrymen
to "go out in new million-man
marches in all cities and villages
and oases."

"Be courageous, rise up,
go out in the streets," he said.
"Raise the green flag in the skies
... the conditions in Libya are
unbearable."
Gadhafi made the appeal in
an poor quality audio recording
and it was not possible to verify
his identity, but it was broad-
cast on Syrian-based Al-Rai TV,
which has become the mouth-
piece of his resistance.
Revolutionary forces, aided
by NATO airstrikes, have
gained control over most of
the North African nation and
forced the leader and two of his
sons into hiding.
Gadhafi has made several
speeches on Al-Rai as he tries
to rally supporters, who are still
waging fierce resistance in his
besieged hometown of Sirte, the
town of Bani Walid southeast
of Tripoli and pockets in the
south.
He was last heard on Sept.
20 calling the revolution a
"charade gaining its legitimacy

through airstrikes."
The International Red Cross,
meanwhile, delivered medical
supplies and other humanitar-
ian aid to civilians in Sirte amid
rapidly deteriorating condi-
tions.
Dibeh Fakhr, a spokeswoman
for the International Commit-
tee of the Red Cross, said two
trucks entered Sirte and distrib-
uted the goods, which included
baby milk, hygiene kits, diapers
and clean drinking water.
It was the ICRC's third suc-
cessful foray into the Medi-
terranean coastal city since
Saturday, but the first time aid
workers reached the main hos-
pital.
Sirte, 250 miles (400 kilome-
ters) southeast of Tripoli, is the
most important of the pro-Gad-
hafi cities that are still holding
out against Libya's new rulers,
and its defenders have put up a
fierce resistance, with the two
sides trading artillery, tank and
mortar shelling.

Quagga quagmire
Protect the Great Lakes from invasive species
M ichigan's Great Lakes are threatened yet again by an inva-
sive species of mussels. While Asian carp have been a
recent concern, a new type of mussel, the quagga, is mul-
tiplying at an alarming rate. Since 2003, the mussels have taken over
the lakes and depleted the food source of many native fish. Not only
are they damaging the ecosystem of the lakes, but they are damaging
the livelihoods of fisherman who depend on the lakes for their income.
It is important that citizens and legislators take this invasive species
seriously and implement regulations to protect the state's lakes.

Go beyond tolerance

Quaggas are related to zebra mussels, and
the species is currently thriving in four of
the five Great Lakes. There are 437 trillion
in Lake Michigan alone, according to a 2010
survey from the National Oceanic and Atmo-
spheric Administration's Great Lakes Envi-
ronmental Research Laboratory.
This species of mussel hails from foreign
ports and attaches to boats that have gained
ballast water. These boats enter the lakes
through the St. Lawrence Seaway. Since
1994, the number of mussels has steadily
increased, with a spike in the population
occurring since 2003. The population of
quagga mussels in the lakes is extremely
high, at four times the number of all fish.
In Lake Michigan and Lake Huron, quag-
ga have preyed on shrimp, reducing them
to near extinction. Quagga mussels eat
almost 98 percent of their weight each day,
and much of what they eat is the same food
shrimp in the Great Lakes eat. These shrimp,
clleddp e-;serve as them 'rfrod source
for game fish like whitefish. Quaggas eat phy-
toplankton which diporeia feed upon, thus
reducing the diporeia population. The mus-
sels also create toxic algae which are respon-

sible for increasing illnesses in humans and
decreasing healthy algae populations.
The species is threatening the livelihood
of many Michigan residents. Anglers boats
that could bring in catches from 90 feet
below the water must now fish deeper, some-
times up to 150 feet. The species disrupts
the food chains of more than one species of
game fish that are necessary for the busi-
ness of countless Michigan anglers fishing
off the coast. While the mussels are decreas-
ing biodiversity in the Great Lakes, they are
also upsetting infrastructure by lining water
pipes and creating costly damage in water
treatment facilities.
With the longest freshwater coastline in
the nation of more than3,000miles, the Great
Lakes contain one-fifth of the world's fresh
water. In order to protect the state's natural
resources, biodiversity and industries reliant
on the Great Lakes, it is necessary regula-
tions are put in place that restrict the number
ofvessels that may carrythe invasive species.
There must be increased regulation of boats
entering the Great Lakes, especially those
that may have picked up ballast water from
ports inhabited by quagga mussels.

The other day, during a meet-
ing among student facilita-
tors for a class I'm taking,
we exchanged
tips and concerns
about prepar-
ing to facilitate
this week's sec-
tion discussion
about gender and
sexuality. We've
already noticed LIBBY
a trend among ASHTON
our students -
especially the
female students
- that they don't strongly identify
with their gender in a sociological
context. Many have said they don't
think gender is significant anymore
as an identifier. Some have said any
oppression women do face - insofar
as they are, by default, sexual objects
in a dominantly male society - isn't
really so bad. In fact, they think it's
kind of flattering.
Our roles as facilitators don't
authorize us to actively inform the
opinions and perceptions of our
students. Even though many of us
have had more experience working
through topics in sociology, we're
peers without classroom hierarchy.
Our conversations are often rooted
in worldviews and self-concepts, not
the more objective stuff of number
games and textual analysis. So, in the
event of a seriously off-putting com-
ment and in practice of tolerance,
maybe we should bite our tongues
and move on?
While walking through the Diag
this week, I saw the obscene affront
to the Universitythat was the larger-
than-life exhibit displaying several
photos of mutilated fetuses and geno-
cide victims, brought to campus by
organization Students for Life. I then
saw the handfuls of students sur-

rounding the display and engaging
in what looked like verbal hair pull-
ing withthe anti-abortion protesters.
Those students, it seemed, simply
couldn't pass by such an aggressively
offensive and absurd scene without
addressing the people responsible.
I overheard two Students for Life
members remarking on the fact that
pro-choice supporters didn't want to
see the truth, which is why they were
unwilling to look at the disturbing
photos. Those students, it seemed,
simply couldn't accept that so many
people were unwilling to understand
abortion as they understood it. So
they forced the images of abortion, as
they see it, onto the University com-
munity - whether we liked it or not.
The dynamic between the anti-
abortion protesters and the students
passing by wasn't so different from
the Diag preachers' regular routine
of religious proselytizing, which is
always met with students' counter-
arguments and, often times, ridicule.
The man screams and holds signs
condemning University students to
hell; the University students laugh
and diagnose insanity. Because of
our collectively prized right to free
speech, we've adapted to a campus
in which people say and do things we
think are ridiculous, and we either
respond with anger and ridicule, or
we remind ourselvesto be tolerant.
But I wonder if tolerance should
really be so valued. If I were to sim-
ply tolerate the opinion of a class-
mate, I'd be deeming her incapable
of thinking.deeply about her beliefs
when pressed. If I were to tolerate the
antics ofthe anti-abortion protesters,
it would be inherently condescend-
ing in that I'd regard their behavior
as so far out of the realm of what's
reasonable that I couldn't even bring
myself to engage. And when I pass
the Diag religious fanatic, I dismiss

him with my tolerance.
I'm not advocating for intoler-
ance either, as it's the flip side of a
duly unimpressive coin. I found the
anti-abortion protesters to exemplify
the worst of intolerance. Their com-
plete intolerance of the opposition
prompted them to visually assault
and offend hundreds of people dur-
ing their two-day exhibit. They
revealed a total lack of respect for
the minds of pro-choice supporters
and an unwillingness to engage in
productive conversation that might
have clarified their understanding of
the truth. Instead, they employed as
much force as they could muster to
effectively punch all of us in the face.
We shouldn't just
bite our tongues
and move on.
I think that if we made an effort to
treat others with respect rather than
to meet their words with tolerance,
we'd achieve a much greater under-
standing of one another and our-
selves. A friend of mine, who is (in my
opinion) amongthe most determined
and effective pro-life leaders of our
generation, understands the world in
a fundamentally different way than
I do. But because she respects me
enough to talk to me, rather than to
tolerate me, I actually believe that it's
possible for all of us to live without
the dissonance caused by plugged
ears and shouting mouths. I guesswe
might call that alternative harmony.

a


Diag exhibit was necessary
to spark debate on abortion
TO THE DAILY:
In response to the outcry against the
Genocide Awareness Project, Students for
Life would like to explain our reasons for
bringing such a graphic display to the Diag
instead of "creating dialogue" in a more
peaceful manner.
Over the past few years, we've reached
out to pro-choice advocates on campus in an
attempt to engage in dialogue about the abor-
tion debate. Last spring, we even brought in a
pro-life apologist and invited myriad faculty
members in women's studies and philosophy to
represent the pro-choice side. We asked every
major pro-choice group on campus to come
debate us - heck, to come hold a forum with us
- but each group refused without even work-
ing with us to modify the event to something
which both our organizations could agree.
We've tabled. We've passed out flyers. We've

serious risks to environment


brought in speakers. No one would listen, and
no one would talk about it - until Monday.
Sure, the display inconvenienced you on the
way to class,but it forced thousands ofstudents
to start thinking about, and even talking about
an issue so important to us that we'll tolerate
the hatred of 40,000 people.
Certainly we'd rather stop the 3,300 abor-
tions per day (a conservative number as report-
ed by the Guttmacher Institute) and keep our
friends through roundtable discussion, but
when we view each abortion as the death of
a unique human being, you can understand
the urgency of our message. No event held in
the Michigan League could have generated as
much talk about the subject as the Diag dis-
play, so we'll applaud ourselves for breaking
the silence, remind the student body of the
resource table we held for pregnant and post-
pregnant women and invite any group or any
individual out there to engage in some straight
talk and real discussion with us.

Sugiyama wrote it would be "ecologically
friendly to spend money on improving the oil
distribution system which in the long run will
cut down costs and emissions." Consider the
boreal forest that sits above these tar sands,
whose deforestation would displace thou-
sands of indigenous people in Alberta, Canada,
unleashing untold tons of carbon dioxide into
the atmosphere. Northern Alberta already
suffered a pipeline leak that spilled 4.5 mil-
lion liters into the Peace River watershed this
spring.
The 20,000 technical jobs created by Key-
stone XL will be for lawyers to defend Trans-
Canada, hazardous waste crews to clean up
spills, lawyers to remediate broken hunting
treaties with Native Americans, doctors to
treat those infected by contaminated drinking
water and scientists to study the delicate Sand
Hill species - an effected three mammals, five
birds, one amphibian, five reptiles, three fish
and two invertebrates - choking to death on
bitumen. Not jobs for the middle class.

NOEL GORDON VWPOINT
Value all sexual expression

TO THE DAILY:
Regarding Joe Sugiyama's recent column
(What's Another 2,000 Miles?, 10/4/2011) The
Domestic Jobs, Domestic Energy, and Deficit
Reduction Act of 2011, H. R.1287, is the legisla-
tion directing the Secretary of State to "expe-
dite the permit request for the Keystone XL
pipeline without considering greenhouse gas
impacts."
Sugiyamatrusts "the State Department isn't
secretly trying to destroy the Great Plains."
Michiganders, remember the Talmadge Creek
oil spill that leaked 877,000 gallons into the
Kalamazoo River last year, exceeding $585
million to clean up? As Louisianans can assure
you, the State Department doesn't like to getits
hands sticky.
Privately funding Keystone XL are the bil-
lionaire Koch brothers, who control 25 per-
cent of imported crude oil sands. They are the
largest single oil and gas donors to the House
Energy and Commerce Committee, attempting
to persuade lawmakers to pass bill H. R. 2401,
the TRAIN Act, to systematically dismantle
the Environmental Protection Agency.

Did you hookup last night? Well, shame on you. At
least, that's what I think Matt Green would say to you
based on arguments made in his most recent column
(Focus on relationships, 10/4/2011).
Apparently, Green believes those of us who choose to
forego committed relationships in favor of what he calls
"random hookups" are "blithely (engaging in) unhealthy
behavior." He says he would rather us all "(ask) one
another out on dates or actually (build) meaningful,
romantic relationships." Now to be clear: I don't have a
problem with Green taking an orthodox position on such
a controversial issue. Nor do I have a problem with the
goals he's trying to reach. What I take issue with is the
presumptuous and oftentimes judgmental way he frames
this debate.
All that being said, let's explore some of Green's argu-
ments just a bit more in-depth, shall we? First of all, I
don't think it's necessarily the case that hookups have to
be meaningless in the way Green implies. Last I checked,
it's quite possible for me to have a hookup with someone
and still remember his or her name the morning after. It's
equally possible for me to bond with my various sexual
partners and still not want to be in a committed relation-
ship. Isn't that the definition of the term "friend-with-
benefits?" But even if I wanted nothing more than to
hookup with someone simply because I found him or her
physically attractive, it'snot clear to me that I'm engaging
in some type of morally unacceptable behavior. As long as
the encounter is safe, consensual and enjoyable, I really
don't see the problem here. Green, however, is guilty of
a much bigger and more paternalistic sin - namely, the
projection of his normative ideas about sexuality onto
others.
He then proceeds to engage us in this rather interest-
ing, and at times borderline sexist, dialogue about the
ways in which gender roles impact our so-called "hookup
culture." He notes, for instance, that he "knows plenty of
men on campus who'd gladly forego the weekend hookup
ritual for something a little less fleeting, if only the oppor-
tunity arose." But even if that were true, I know just as

many guys (and girls) who enjoy that weekend hookup
ritual. Whether it's because of a busy schedule, a bad
dating history or something else entirely, many college
students just don't want to be in a committed relation-
ship duringthis tenuous point in their life. And I, for one,
think that's atotally acceptable position to take. I'd rather
people be honest with me about their intentions from the
beginning than waste my time trying to change them.
And as for his argument suggesting that "hookups only
exacerbate emotional solitude," there simplyisn't enough
evidence to substantiate such a claim. All we have are a
few short-term studies, including one from the Family
Institute at Florida State University which found, "hook-
ing up is not uniformly positive or negative in emerging
adulthood in regards to psychological distress."
Perhaps the most intriguing part of Green's piece,
though, is the call he makes for a "mass grassroots ini-
tiative to replace the hookup culture with a dating cul-
ture or at least a culture of respect." Now maybe it's just
me, but I think there are a lot bigger problems on cam-
pus than who's going home with who after Pride Night
at Necto. But that's beside the point. It's much more
important for people to realize that Green's argument is
indicative of the sexual hierarchy that currently exists ir
American society. His op-ed perpetuatesthe ideathatit's
ok to privilege some people because of the sexual choices
they make and not others. I, on the other hand, support a
system wherein all forms of sexual expression are treated
equally and respectfully - a system that recognizes that
the pursuit of sexual gratification can be an intrinsically
valuable thing in and of itself.
Sex doesn't require emotional attachments or monog-
amous commitments; though admittedly, these things
often do make the experience better. At the end of the
day, it's important for people to rememberthat we are all
independent agents capable of making our own sexual
decisions, and that hooking up is to one person what a
relationship may be to another.

PETITION
From Page 1
"It has been too long since
Michigan had a woman speak-
er," Kursman said, "and I think
Tina is a great role model."
Fey is known for her work
on NBC's sketch comedy series
Saturday Night Live and the TV
show 30 Rock. She starred in
the films "Baby Mama," "Date
Night" and "Mean Girls," which
she also wrote. Fey has received
seven Emmy Awards, three
Golden Globe Awards, four
Screen Actors Guild Awards and
four Writers Guild of America
Awards.
Though Kursman said she
originally thought of Fey as a
speaker several years ago, she
put the plan into action after
hearing about the nomination of
Zuckerberg.
"It became a petition because
there was a movement for Mark
Zuckerberg, and I just really was
displeased with the idea of him
giving a speech to our graduat-
ing class," Kursman said.

LSA senior Jake Steinerman
started the petition in support
of Zuckerberg this past summer.
However, Kursman said inter-
est in Fey has already surpassed
Zuckerberg.
"In the first two days, we
garnered over 600 signatures
for the petition," Kursman said.
"The Zuckerberg petition has
been up since the summer and
only has 250."
She added that because Uni-
versity commencement speakers
traditionally receive an honor-
ary degree, the nominees must
meet specific criteria set by the
Honorary Degree Committee,
which consists of two University
students, faculty, alumni and
administrators.
"The nominee should have
demonstrable distinguished
achievement in an activity relat-
ed to the University's missions
of research and scholarship,
education, or service," or a spe-
cific connection to the Univer-
sity or the state of Michigan, the
criteria states.
The nominees approved by
the committee are then shown

to University President Mary
Sue Coleman. In response to
the recommendations for com-
mencement speakers, Lisa Con-
nolly, project manager in the
University's Office of the Presi-
dent, wrote in e-mail interview
that Coleman carefully consid-
ers all options presented by stu-
dents.
"President Coleman appreci-
ates recommendations for com-
mencement speakers and does
take them into consideration,"
Connolly wrote.
Like Steinerman, who has
promoted Zuckerberg for speak-
er through Facebook, Kursman
said the social networking site
has been the best way to gain
support for the Fey campaign.
But she said spreading the word
by mouth is also important, as
her application and petition are
due today.
"(If) students sign the peti-
tion, it would be greatly appre-
ciated because I know there are
a lot of students out there that
would love for Tina Fey to speak,
and I think she would be a really
great fit," Kursman said.

MISCONDUCT
From Page 1
probable or reasonably certain
that the sexual harassment or
violence occurred," the guide-
lines state.
Every allegation of sexual
misconduct brought against a
student will be evaluated and
potentially investigated by the
Office of Student Conflict Reso-
lution and the University's Title
IX Coordinator, according to
Harper's and Scarnecchia's
e-mail.
"(If) the University deter-
mines, based on a preponder-
ance of the evidence, that a
student is responsible for sexual
misconduct, sanctions or inter-
ventions will be applied to elim-
inate the misconduct, prevent
its recurrence and remedy its
effects," Harper and Scarnec-
chia wrote.
While the e-mail to students
stated that the interim proce-
dure "supersedes" the perma-
nent policy, Fitzgerald said the
University's Statement of Stu-
dent Rights and Responsibili-
ties - the set of regulations all
University students must

follow - has not been changed
for good.
"This isn't an amendment
to the Statement of Student
Rights and Responsibilities,
but it is a new procedure for
how allegations of sexual mis-
conduct will be handled, and
that new procedure is based
on the guidance provided by
the Department of Education,"
Fitzgerald said.
He added that the interim
procedure will remain in place
until a permanent amendment
is adopted in the Statement. A
permanent amendment can only
be proposed by an executive offi-
cer of the University, the Senate
Assembly - the faculty's gov-
erning body - or the Michigan
Student Assembly.
Numerous University groups
were involved in developing and
reviewing the interim procedure
including OSCR, the Division
of Student Affairs, the Depart-
ment of Public Safety and the
Sexual Assault Prevention and
Awareness Center, according to
Fitzgerald.
In December 2009, the Senate
Advisory Committee on Univer-
sity Affairs - the lead faculty
governing body - recommend-

ed that MSA pass a measure
to permanently require a pre-
ponderance of evidence when
investigating all violations of the
Statement of Student Rights and
Responsibilities - not just sexu-
al misconduct. Though MSA ini-
tially endorsed the amendment,
it retracted its support because
it felt that the lower standard of
evidence shouldn't apply to all
types of complaints.
MSA President DeAndree
Watson could not be reached for
comment on the policy change.
Fitzgerald said he hopes the
change dictated by the Depart-
ment of Education and the ini-
tiation of the interim policy will
prompt MSA and the University
community to discuss and create
a fixed procedure in the State-
ment regarding the standard of
evidence needed in substantiat-
ing cases of alleged sexual mis-
conduct.
"(The interim policy) also
allows us to havea much deeper,
richer discussion as a University
community, which will abso-
lutely involve MSA, the students
and all aspects of the University
community ... as we craft and
put in place a permanent policy,"
Fitzgerald said.

beat for NBC News in 1988.
The women remained friends
during Betty Ford's battle with
breast cancer and Mitchell's
more recent encounter with the
disease. Bales recalled Mitch-
ell's visits to her family's home
in Beaver Creek, Mich. Dur-
ing these trips, Mitchell and
her husband, economist Alan
Greenspan, would engage in
lengthy discussions with Bale's
parents.
"During the many, many
Beaver Creek stays with my
parents, discussions among
the four of them were lively,
and I mean very lively," Bales
said. "No matter what, wheth-
er during the day or evening,
there was an image that never
changed. It was an image that
I have always remembered and
hold dear. The image of the
ever-present smiles of mother
and dad whenever they were
with Andrea and Alan."
During her speech, Mitchell
spoke fondly of her time spent
with the Ford family. She talked
about a visit to their home in
which Betty Ford helped Mitch-
ell pack her suitcase as she pre-
pared for a last-minute trip to
Havana for a breaking story on
Fidel Castro. Moments like this,
Mitchell said, exemplified the
compassion the Fords extended
from their Michigan home and

into the White House.
"(The Fords) created a cli-
mate of normalcy in the White
House," she said. "I say that
with so much admiration.
When you think of the pomp
and circumstance, and security
and everything that goes into
being in that house ... they did it
with such grace and humility."
Mitchell lauded Ford's presi-
dency, particular his global
awareness and consideration of
other countries in his foreign
policies.
"He so understood the
importance of global integra-
tion," she said.
Mitchell compared the dif-
ference in political climate
between the time of Ford's pres-
idency and today. Mitchell said
she traces the argumentative
atmosphere of today's Congress
back to modern media..
"Think of the contrast of
politics then and politics now,"
Mitchell said. "What would
Gerald Ford ... say of the delib-
erate and accidental miscom-
munication of this summer's
debt ceiling crisis?"
Mitchell said that begin-
ning with the Clarence Thomas
hearings in 1991 - in which
the U.S. Supreme Court justice
was accused of sexually harass-
ing Anita Hill, a law professor
at the University of Oklahoma
- broadcast networks began
operating with a "new velocity
of information." Mitchell urged
those in attendance to demand

more analytical and compre-
hensive coverage of politics
from their media sources.
From sparring with former
British Prime Minister Mar-
garet Thatcher to covering the
Reagan-Gorbachev Summit,
Mitchell said her diverse jour-
nalistic experience stems from
having a broad-based educa-
tion focused on the merits of
reading and writing. She said
these skills are crucial for stu-
dents aspiring to have careers
in broadcast journalism.
"Writing is the most under-
valued talent," Mitchell said,
naming journalists like NBC
Nightly News anchor and man-
aging editor, Brian Williams,
who exemplify the power of
writing in the broadcast jour-
nalism industry.
LSA sophomore Andrew
Craft, an aspiring journalist,
said Mitchell's lecture was a
window into the life of a broad-
cast journalist.
"I like hearing reporters tell
their stories," Craft said. "They
get to meet famous people and
travel the world."
LSA sophomore Molly Mayer
said she enjoyed listening to
Mitchell's lecture since she is
an avid viewer of her work.
"I grew up watching her,"
Mayer said. "Getting to know
the other side is definitely
exciting."

MOVEMENT
From Page 1
employed by the University of
Michigan Health System, the
rising cost of higher education
and the lack of press coverage of
the Occupy movement across the
country.
Occupy Ann Arbor developed
after University alum Whitney
Miller started a Facebook group.
In an interview after last night's
event, Miller said she registered
the page as a group, but needed
to change it into a "cause" once
she began receiving requests to
join at a more rapid rate than she
was able to respond to.
Despite the interest - the
Facebook page had 970 "likes"
by 2 a.m. this morning - Miller
said she was unsure how many
people would attend the meet-
ing. She stressed that the gath-

ering was not meant to be a
demonstration but rather an
event to facilitate increased dia-
logue about the issues. She said
she was pleased by the crowd,
which stretched halfway across
the Diag.
"I think it was very produc-
tive, judging by all the collec-
tive information that we got
from individuals who want to
help out, who have resources
they can offer," Miller said. "I
would say that it was very suc-
cessful."
Part of the success, she added,
stemmed from the array of
grievances voiced by the speak-
ers, who had three minutes each
to address the crowd. The audi-
ence applauded every speaker
consistently and exchanged pro-
ductive ideas, Miller said.
"There was a good amount of
diversity," she said. "I feel like
the crowd supported each other

and acted democratically when
something was outside of the
box ... People were open to lis-
tening to each other."
Lucianna Sabgash, a sopho-
more at Wayne State Univer-
sity and an organizer of Occupy
Detroit, agreed that the meeting
would be effective in generating
conversation.
Sabgash said she attended the
event out of frustration of the
slow pace of political change in
the nation.
"If we are the majority, maybe
we could actually be represent-
ed by some political action," she
said. "I voted for none of this. I
voted for change and saw all the
same."
Though Miller and Sab-
gash said they don't anticipate
any future Occupy Ann Arbor
events, Sabgash said she is look-
ing forward to organizing more
gatherings throughout the state.

APPLICATION

something that inhibits other
note-taking devices, said Schiff,
a former Michigan Daily colum-
nist.
"The product vision is to be
the quickest, easiest way for
you to keep track of tasks, ideas
and anything that you want to
remember," Schiff said. "We're
trying to provide just enough of
a feature set, but keep it simple
enough that it's really compel-
ling and easy to use."
In addition to being avail-
able online, Fetchnotes will be
compatible with iPhones and
Androids and accessible through
texting and instant messaging.
Lee said a key business strategy
for the start-up is integrating
Fetchnotes with other prod-
ucts that consumers already use
such as Google Chat, Jabber and
Yahoo. The product uses hash
tags to organize notes by cat-
egory and "@ tags" to send notes
to others.
Fetchnotes will serve as an
effective tool for students, espe-
cially those participating in
group projects, Lee said.
"It's an easy way to coordi-
nate projects and to communi-
cate," Schiff said. "And it really
makes it a lot easier for you to get
things done with other people."
To receive customer feedback
on their product, Schiff and Lee
had a pre-launch marketing
campaign in March using a com-
bination of social media sites.
Testing for Fetchnotes was com-
pleted via a beta trial that ends
at the end of November.
After the free beta period,

customers can use the basic
functions of Fetchnotes at no
cost or purchasea premium plan
for $4.99 per month, accord-
ing to Schiff. The premium
plan includes more services like
access to more groups and tex-
ting notes.
With the exception of legal
costs, Lee and Schiff funded the
entire project themselves.
"We're trying to bootstrap
our business," Lee said. "Basi-
cally, we are not taking outside
investments."
The students created the
application after they took a
course at the University's Cen-
ter for Entrepreneurship. Doug
Neal, managing director of the
Center for Entrepreneurial
Programs and adjunct assis-
tant professor of entrepreneur-
ship, said Schiff and Lee further
developed Fetchnotes in his
entrepreneurship class, "The
Practicum," which is part of the
nine-credit Entrepreneurship
Certificate.
Neal said he believes Fetch-
notes has the potential to be
successful while simultaneously
serving as a learning tool for
Schiff and Lee.
"They are really embracing
the entrepreneurial mindset,
trying ideas and working with
costumers and experimenting
through a variety of business
models to try to find a variety,
a combination to yield success,"
Neal said.
But he added that success
isn't the only thing that should
be measured in the students'
pursuit.
"I think what's really impor-
tant is that we do not focus
on the success of the venture.

We need to be very comfort-
able with failures and learn-
ing from these failures," Neal
said."Entrepreneurship - it's
about trying to do the impos-
sible, and when you try to do the
impossible, many times you will
fail, but that's OK. That's just
part of the process. You get back
up and you try again."
Schiff echoed Neal's senti-
ments and said learning how to
be innovative is one of the most
important skills in the business
realm.
"I think that this is one of the
most valuable skills we picked
up as entrepreneurs is knowing
how to look at situations and
asking, 'How can we do this a
different way?"' Schiff said.
Schiff praised Ann Arbor's
entrepreneurial atmosphere
for the support the community
gives to aspiring entrepreneurs.
He added that he thinks the
University is a "pay-it-forward
community" and said he is
excited Fetchnotes is a part of
it.
"It's almost shocking how
supportive people are," Schiff
said. "You ask people for help,
and they're like, 'Sure, it's
done."'
Business junior Matt Kanter-
man wrote in an e-mail inter-
view that he uses Fetchnotes
to help him manage his daily
affairs and stay organized.
"Fetchnotes allows me to
bring all my ideas into one place
easily, effectively and instan-
taneously," Kanterman wrote.
"It really makes it so that I can
organize my life in down times,
and in stressful busy times I can
leave myself notes just by tex-
ting."

Steve Jobs remembered in
tributes around the world


Flowers, candles
left outside
Apple stores in
rememberance
Steve Jobs was grieved around
the world yesterday through the
very devices he conceived: People
held up pictures of candles on
their iPads, reviewed his life on
Macintosh computers and tapped
out tributes on iPhones.
One day after his death, two
days after Apple introduced the
latest incarnation of a touch-
screen phone that touched pop
culture, sadness and admiration
poured out - not for a rock star,
not for a religious figure, but for an
Americancorporate executive.
By people who have grown
up in a world where iPod head-
phones are as ubiquitous as
wristwatches were to a previous
generation, Jobs was remem-
bered as their Elvis Presley or
John Lennon. Perhaps even their
Thomas Edison.
"It's like the end of the innova-
tors," said Scott Robbins, 34, who
described himself as an Apple fan
of 20 years and who rushed to
an Apple Store in San Francisco
when he heard the news.
Apple announced Jobs' death

Wednesday night and remem-
bered him as a "visionary and
creative genius." The company
announced no cause of death, but
Jobs had been diagnosed with
a rare pancreatic cancer seven
years ago and had a liver trans-
plant in 2009. He was 56.
Yesterday, the Apple website,
which usually features slick pre-
sentations of multicolored iPods
and ever-thinner MacBook lap-
top computers, simply displayed
a black-and-white photo of Jobs,
thumb and finger to his beard as
if in contemplation.
Around the world, tributes
sprang up of the highest and low-
est technology.
In the Ginza shopping district
of Tokyo, people held up iPhones
and iPads, their screens facing
outward and displaying sharply
defined, touchable graphics of
flickeringcandles.
At an Apple Store in Hong
Kong, old and new means of grief
came together: People scribbled
"RIP" and "We miss Steve" and
longer notes of condolence on
Post-It notes, and stuck them to
an iPad display.
And at the 24-hour Apple
Store inmidtown Manhattan, the
remembrances were more tradi-
tional. Passersby left flowers and
candles, actual ones. Even there,
people snapped pictures of the

memorial with their iPhones.
"I was so saddened. For me it
was like MichaelJacksonorPrin-
cess Diana - that magnitude,"
Stephen Jarjoura said at the
Apple Store in Sydney. His said
Jobs left a legacy to rival Edison
and Albert Einstein.
Philippe Meunier, a senior
partner of a Canadian ad agency
who was visiting New York from
Montreal, reflected on how weird
it was to receive the news of Jobs'
death on the phone he invented.
In a measure of his impact on
personal technology, Jobs was
venerated byhis fiercestcompeti-
tors in the hours after his death.
Bill Gates, the co-founder of
Microsoft, a company that Apple
once treated as Goliath to its
David, then blew past in market
value, said it was "an insanely
great honor" to have known Jobs.
A statement of grief came from
Sony, whose Walkman and Disc-
man were buried by the iPod.
Google added a link to the
Apple site on its famously mini-
malist search page. Mark Zuck-
erberg, the founder of Facebook,
thanked him for changing the
world.
To the extent that there is an
online version of the old-time
public square, it was overrun
Thursday by remembrances of
Jobs.

Elizabeth Warren speaks in Lowell, Mass. Tuesday, Oct. 4 during a debate between six Massachusetts Democratic
candidates for the U.S. Senate seat held by Republican Scott Brown.
Sen. Scott Brown criticized

Romney, Perry try to recruit
Christie, Palm supporters

Leading candidates
seek donor
contributions
WASHINGTON (AP) - Rivals
Rick Perry and Mitt Romney are
furiously scurrying to recruit
heartbroken holdouts who had
hoped GOP celebrities Chris
Christie or Sarah Palin would
join the Republican presidential
contest.
With a slew of donors and
activists now up for grabs, the
leading two Republican candi-
dates redoubled their efforts
- and made personal appeals -
this week to win over unaligned
high-dollar and high-power GOP
players in what's become largely

a two-man nomination fight.
"We're at a point when the
large group of undecided activ-
ists are going to choose their
candidate," said Jennifer Horn,
a conservative activist in New
Hampshire who hasn't picked a
contender. "People are starting
to accept the field and accept that
these are our choices. It's time
to get behind someone who is a
candidate, someone who is run-
ning."
Romney, who essentially has
been running for president for
five years, spent a chunk of the
week calling fundraisers and
activists anew who have long sat
on the sidelines; the former Mas-
sachusetts governor hoped they
would finally decide to back him.
Perry, who entered the race just

seven weeks ago, was working
to make up quickly for lost time;
the Texas governor hoped that
new supporters would give his
campaign a lift after a few rocky
weeks.
Both proved persuasive - to a
point.
Home Depot co-founder Ken
Langone, a Christie backer,
quickly joined Romney's team.
So, too, did billionaire supermar-
ket executive John Catsimatidis
and hedge-fund giant Paul Sing-
er. Romney was trading friendly
emails with the three even as
they were publicly calling for
Christie to join the race. Former
Republican National Committee
Chairman Jim Nicholson also
said he would back Romney in
the wake of Christie's exit.

Warren says she
didn't take her
clothes off to pay
college tuition
BOSTON (AP) - U.S. Sen. Scott
Brown took a jab at Democratic
rival Elizabeth Warren during a
radio interview yesterday, say-
ing "Thank God" she didn't take
her clothes off to help pay for col-
lege. His remark came two days
after a debate in which Warren
referred to his nude Cosmopolitan
magazine centerfold from his law-
school days.
Democratic Party officials
immediately branded Brown's
comment as sexist and more suit-
able to a "frat house, not a race for
U.S. Senate." Warren said she'd
survive a jab from Brown.
The Massachusetts Republi-
can made the remark yesterday
morning during an interview on
WZLX-FM when asked to respond
to a comment by Warren during a
Democratic primary debate Tues-
day night.
Warren and the five other
Democratic candidates hoping
for a chance to challenge Brown
during next year's election were
asked how they paid for their col-
lege educations. The questioner
noted that while Brown was in law

school, the future senator posed
nude for Cosmopolitan in a photo
spread with a strategically placed
centerfold crease.
Warren responded in part by
saying "I kept my clothes on." She
went on to say that she took out
student loans, opted for a public
university and held a part time job
to cover her bills.
During Brown's interview on
the classic rock station, one of
the hosts asked him to respond to
Warren's comment that she kept
her clothes on.
Brown laughed and said
"Thank God." The host laughed
along with him.
The freshman senator also
defended his decision to pose for
the magazine, saying modeling
was his best opportunity to pay for
school.
"I didn't go to Harvard, I went
to the school of hard knocks and I
did whatever I had to do to pay for
school," Brown said, pointing to a
difficult upbringing and his par-
ents' multiple divorces.
Brown attended Tufts Uni-
versity and Boston College Law
School, both private universities.
Warren, a Harvard law professor
and consumer advocate, attended
the University of Houston and
received a law degree from Rut-
gers University, both of which are
public schools.
"Let them throw stones. I did


what I had to do," Brown added.
"But not for having that opportu-
nity I never would have been able
to pay for school."
Warren, speaking to reporters
Thursday afternoon, tried to take
Brown's remark in stride.
"I'll survive a few jabs from
Scott Brown over my appearance,"
she said.
She also denied trying to take a
jab at him during the debate.
"I answered a question about
how I paid for college," she said. "I
worked a lot of part-time jobs and
actually one full-time job."
Massachusetts Democratic
Party Executive Director Clare
Kelly labeled Brown's comments
"mudslinging" and said they "are
the kind of thing you would expect
to hear in a frat house, not a race
for U.S. Senate."
"Scott Brown's comments
send a terrible message that even
accomplished women who are
held in the highest esteem can be
laughingly dismissed based on
their looks," Kelly said.
Brown's campaign manager,
Jim Barnett, responded by trying
to cast Warren as an "elitist"
"It's elitist of Professor War-
ren to look down at the decisions
Scott Brown made to put himself
through college and rise above the
circumstances of his life," Barnett
wrote in an email after Brown's
radio interview. "Scott has fought
and scraped for everything he's
got."
Warren has emerged as an
early frontrunner in the Demo-
cratic primary race.
A recent UMass Lowell-Bos-
ton Herald poll showed Brown
getting 41percent ofthe vote and
Warren receiving 38 percent,
within the poll's margin of error.
Warren also was the strong
favorite of the six Democratic
candidates when pollsters sur-
veyed potential Democratic
primary voters. She garnered 36
percent of the vote while none
of the other five got more than
5 percent.
The poll surveyed 1,005 reg-
istered voters in Massachusetts
by landline and cell phone from
Sept. 22-28. The margin of error
was 3.8 percentage points, high-
er for smaller samples such as
potential Democratic primary
voters.
The other Democrats in the
race include City Year youth
program co-founder Alan
Khazei; immigration attorney
Marisa DeFranco; state Rep.
Tom Conroy; Newton resident
Herb Robinson; and Robert
Massie, a self-described "social
justice advocate" who ran
unsuccessfully for lieutenant
governor in 1994.

Cole said in an
interview with The Michigan
Daily.
Four mixtapes into his career,
J. Cole - who will perform
tonight at the Royal Oak Music
Theatre - has caught the atten-
tion of industry vets and rap fans
alike. He's a product of a unique
phenomenon that has seen artists
like Drake, Wiz Khalifa and Odd
Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All
gain intense popularity before a
formal album release.
"It's my first album, but it feels
like my third," Cole said. "I've
been touring so much and I've
been putting out projects."
Having passed his forma-
tive years in North Carolina,
Cole reminisced about spending
time with one of his cousins who
encouraged him to start rapping.
"He was older than me and I
looked up to him," he said. "And
he had girls."
Although the ladies might have
been an initial inspiration, Cole
knew he wanted to do more than
simply serenade some neighbor-
hood honeys from time to time.
"(My cousin) was just free-
styling and fooling around,
but I thought it was dope," he
explained. "Poetry wasn't hard
for me... and once I started, I took
it seriously."
After fully committing him-

J. Cole went to St. John's University in New York to be close to the music industry.

self to pursuing his passion, Cole
made a mature decision many in
his position would never think
of doing: He went to college. But
though he valued his education,
his main motivation in going
away to school was to relocate to
a place closer to the music indus-
try he so desperately wanted to
make an impact on. So he attend-
ed St. John's University in New
York.
"It's the best decision I ever
made," he said. "It's the reason I
am where I am now. Being close to
the industry allowed me to learn
so much."
During that time, Jay-Z was
impressed by Cole's song "Lights
Please," and soon after offered
him a record deal on his label Roc
Nation.
Now, Cole considers the hip-
hop mogul a major influence on
his life and career.
"My relationship with Jay-Z is
a great one," he said. "He came to
my release party last night for a
celebration. It's like a mentorship,
and it's really just him knowing
everything and me not knowing
everything."
A specific aspect of Jay-Z's
career that J. Cole has emulated is
crafting an engaging live show -
a rare feat for a rapper. He takes
an aggressive approach, bringing

unbridled energy into every song,
and stresses the importance of
making eye contact with as many
audience members as possible.
His live show isn't his only rap
irregularity. Cole also shows a
sensitive side from time to time,
and his work can deal with issues
not often touched on by hip-hop
artists. In his song "Lost Ones,"
which addresses abortion, Cole
puts himself in the shoes of both
men and women to exhaust all
perspectives, displayinghis knack
for storytelling in a clear and emo-
tionally stirring manner.
"It's a real-life situation, not
even with me," he explained. "(It's
something) I've seen a friend go
through. And I kept on question-
ing it inside my head, like, 'Man,
I wonder what he's feeling right
now?' and, 'I wonder what she's
feeling right now? I wonder what
it would sound like if I wrote
about that?"'
When the final numbers came
in after Cole World's first week
of sales, it had grabbed the num-
ber one spot on the Billboard top
albums chart. And even though
this is evidence that his hard
work has paid off, with over 40
international tour dates sched-
uled this fall and a new mixtape
in the works, he doesn't plan on
slowing down anytime soon.

Shih will transform from student
to singer at the Power Center
in one of her few performances
scheduled this semester.
Shih dreamed up the stage
name Vienna Teng when she was
an avid piano-playing12-year-old,
only for it to become her musical
alias years later. Teng's amateur
career as a musician began in the
smoky shadows of bars and coffee
shop corners of California while
she was working as a computer
programmer in Silicon Valley.
After a few years of mostly local
gigs, she hired an agent who was
able to book her as an opener for
Joan Baez and similar artists.
Before long, Teng was headlining
her own gigs nationwide.
"My voice is on the soothing
side, but I really love music that
pushes me a bit," Shih said. "You
could describe it as mellow but
adventurous pop music."
Music has kept the 32-year-old
busy - she has released four stu-
dio albums in the last decade. But
now that she's a student, Shih has
chosen to temporarily cut back on
musical involvement.
Last winter, Shih tried to bal-
ance a full courseload and a tour
schedule that required her to
travel throughout the country.
The ensuing balancing act proved
chaotic but insightful - she
learned her limits living as both a
student and as an artist.

COMPETING THROUGH DANCE
* Bring on the Bollywood

By JACOB AXELRAD
Daily Community Culture Editor
The songs and dances from one
of the world's largest film indus-
tries are nowembodiedin Manzil,
the University's first co-ed Bolly-
wood dance team. Manzil means
"dream" or "goal" in Hindi, and
according to Ross School of Busi-
ness junior Nikhil Kulkarni, who
serves as a co-captain of the team,
the name was chosen because it
simply flows well with the word
"Michigan."
Bollywood dance origi-
nates with the films produced
in Mumbai, India. While in the
United States the music and film
industries are mostly separate,
Bollywood movies are more
reminiscent of classic Broadway
shows: the standard components
of character, plot and resolution
combined with an element of song
and dance.
"The film and music industry
in India is basically intertwined,"
said LSA junior and team co-cap-
tain Dhwani Joshi. "Instead of a
Kanye West song, there's the lat-
est Bollywood song."
What began last semester as an
idea among nine students with a
passion for Bollywood dance has
nearly doubled in size. Manzil
now takes its place amongnumer-
ous similar teams at schools rang-
ing from UCLA and California
- Berkeley on the West Coast to
NYU on the East Coast. And with
Manzil's emergence, the number
of teams around the state has only
increased. Soon after the group's
inception last March, Michi-
gan State University and Wayne
State University started their
own teams, marking Manzil as
the trendsetter for schools in the
region.
As Joshi explains it, Bollywood
dance encompasses two distinct
categories: traditional and Fusion.
Traditional Bollywood dance is

Pan Am' a flight to the 1960s

By SAM CENZHANG
For the Daily
It's impossible to talk about
"Pan Am" without bringing
up AMC's "Mad Men," a show
to which the new ABC drama
owes both the-
matic and aes-
thetic debts.
"Pan Am," like Pan Am
its critically
acclaimed big Pilot
brother, offers Sundays at10 p.m.
a sweeping ABC
vision of the
1960s, this time
through the lens of steward-
esses for the eponymous airline.
The show blatantly lays its thesis
statement out - viewers looking
for the kind of subtext that makes
"Mad Men" what it is should stay
away. Not being "Mad Men" is no
crime, though, and while "Pan
Am" smells a bit like escapism, it
is sleek, well-done and fun escap-
ism.
Superficially, it's easy to dis-
miss "Pan Am" as "Mad Men" for
a network audience. There are
stylistic echoes of "Mad Men,"
but this show is brighter and more
expansive. (It does, after all, take
place in the sky.) Christina Ricci
("Monster") and Kelli Garner
("My Generation") fairly gleam as
they walk through airport termi-
nals. We get shots of Rome, Lon-
don and a helicopter flight across

New York. The visual trappings
of "Pan Am" are sumptuous and
provide as good a backdrop as one
can ask for.
But "Pan Am" is not as dense or
as deep as "Mad Men," preferring
breadth over depth with every
scene. There are a lot of different
plots flying around (as it were),
including some Cold War espio-
nage to go with the soapy stuff
you'dexpect. Tothe show's credit,
though, it never gets too confus-
ing. Here, too, "Pan Am" distanc-
es itself from "Mad Men." Don
Draper is shrouded in mystery for
most of that show's run. In this
pilot, we get flashback sequences
that lay out a lot of backstory.
Nothing is alluded to that doesn't
get shown - but there's still the
right amount of intrigue.
"Pan Am" traffics in character
archetypes, but it's not a prob-
lem here. The cast is a talented
one, and there's something to be
said for well-executed conven-
tion. Garner shines in the pilot,
even though her "good at my job
but everyone notices my sister
because she's gorgeous and now
we work together" material is
by no means original. Margot
Robbie (of the Australian show
"Neighbours"), who plays said
sister, is in fact gorgeous but can
also act, playing up with deft
touch her character's desire to
be something more than a tro-
phy wife. The male actors aren't

given very much to do except be
square-jawed, which they suc-
ceed at. Christina Ricci is much
too talented an actress to waste
on the broadly comedic support-
ing material she's given here, but
she is very likable.
Stewardesses
help pilot
take off.
Some parts of the pilot do fall
a little flat. The "oh my god we're
flying" takeoff scene, complete
with majestic string music, is
overwrought. The end of the epi-
sode, featuring a little girl looking
up in awe at the stewardesses, is
cute but predictable. A charac-
ter unsubtly says, "They don't
know that they're a new breed of
women. They just had an impulse
to take flight." Fourth grade writ-
ing lessons still apply here: Show,
don't tell.
None of the elements in the
pilot are slam dunks, but there are
no flops either. There's a little bit
of everything, and a lot of style.
"Pan Am" isn't "Mad Men," but
it's not trying to be. It's fun, styl-
ish and has just enough substance
to latch onto. For a network "Mad
Men" ripoff, that's excellent.

Borges, Robinson give Big Ten defenses trouble

By TIM ROHAN
Daily Sports Editor
The idea was born just after
spring football ended, when it
became apparent that Al Borges
would have to find a way to get
Devin Gardner on the field.
The Michigan coaches weren't
willing rotate quarterbacks series
by series, so something creative
had to be the solution.
The offensive-minded guru
dug deep, contemplating ways to
get the 6-foot-4 sophomore Gard-
ner on the field at the same time
as the dynamic junior Denard
Robinson. Borges remembered
a formation the San Diego Char-
gers used to run back in the late
1980s, early 1990s - they used
to put a skill position player at
quarterback who could throw the
ball, and move the quarterback
elsewhere. It was a part of former
Chargers' offensive coordinator
Ernie Zampese's playbook.
From there, Borges tinkered.
"As soon as you see something
that fits your personnel, you tap it
and see what it looks like," Borges
said. "It may not fit today's foot-
ball - that was a long time ago -
but maybe it does."
For a mind like Borges's the
possibilities are endless, having
Robinson lined up in the backfield
with two other running backs and

zle."
With his arm, Robinson put
together another piece of his
own puzzle against the Golden
Gophers, competing the first 11
passes he attempted and finish-
ing the day - all two-and-a-half
quarters worth - completing
15-of-19 for 169 yards and two
touchdowns.
For weeks, Robinson had been
swallowed by questions due to his
poor mechanics and even worse
results. After leading a thrilling
comeback victory with his arm,
he threw for less than 100 yards
in back-to-back games before hit-
ting his stride against Minnesota.
Borges decided prior to the game
that he needed to call plays get-
ting Robinson into a rhythm with
short-to-intermediate routes.
Right from Robinson's first
pass - a curl route to Jeremy Gal-
lon - that's exactly what Michi-
gan did.
Robinson and his receivers
had worked on their timing, mak-
ing sure the ball was coming out
when the receivers expected it on
the quarterback's three and five-
step drops. Even though Minne-
sota hardly pressured Robinson, it
was easy to tell his footwork and
mechanics were on point.
"We worked on it pretty good,"
Borges said. "And he took it to
heart. He was stressing that he

wasn't throwing well. He's a
better passer, I've told you that
before.
"He got his screws in the
ground pretty good and trans-
ferred through most of the
throws, and he was pretty much
on the money. And he touched a
few balls nice, too. He dropped
a couple balls in, and the key to
passing is it's a finesse art."
Now Robinson has to put it
all together - running, passing
intermediate, and throwing the
deep bombs he didn't attempt
against Minnesota. Once that
happens, the game will open up,
Borges explained, because throw-
ing the ball downfield - or at least
attempting to - keeps the defense
honest and frees up space to run.
Still, seeing his passes com-
pleted did something to boost
his confidence, Robinson said,
because even though they'd done
that all summer, it wasn't clicking
in games.
"I told him when I came here,
'We're going to see what we can
do,' " Borges said. "And I knew
there was going to be some devel-
opmental pain here because it's
so different the way we coach a
quarterback, but as he gets his feet
on the ground literally and figu-
ratively, you're going to see he'll
make more and more headway as
we go."

Junior quarterback Denard Robinson threw for 169 yards on 15-of-19 passing against Minnesota last Saturday.

Gardner under center. All four can
run the ball, and if junior running
back Vincent Smith is back there,
three of them can throw it too.
Robinson took handoffs, faked
like he was throwing the ball,
acted like a decoy and ran an
option play too - all in just four
plays.
"Yeah, I mean we haven't done
(anything) out of itcyet that we can

do," Robinson said Monday with a
wide smile. "It's goingto be kinda
fun to do it."
Added Borges: "(In) Big Ten
play, we'll empty the drawer more
as we go now."
As Michigan enters the beef of
its Big Ten schedule this weekend
on the road against Northwest-
ern, Borges and Michigan coach
Brady Hoke accomplished what

they wanted with the package:
involve Gardner on offense and
scare other teams silly with Rob-
inson.
"Part of that positive is people
now (have to) work on it," Hoke
said. "That's just one more thing

The only thing bigger than
