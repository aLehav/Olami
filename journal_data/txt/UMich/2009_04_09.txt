Tough road
ahead for
GM CEO
Armed with University
lessons, Fritz Henderson tries
to right struggling automaker
By VERONICA MENALDI
Daily StaffReporter
Fritz Henderson may have the most unenvide
job in America. His predecessor forced out by the
Obama administration and his company barrel-
ing toward the uncertain world of bankruptcy,
Henderson - who took over as CEO of General
Motors Corp. last Tuesday - is in the national
spotlight to save one of America's largest compa-
nies in record time.
As he takes on that task, he may be drawing on
some of the skills and lessons he learned as a Uni-
versity student almost 30 years ago.
Henderson received his bachelor's degree in busi-
ness administration from the University in 1980.
During his time here, he was also a walk-on pitcher
for the Michigan baseball team from 1978 to 1979
and a William A. Paton Award winner, an award he
received after earning a top score on the Michigan
certified public accountant examination in 1980.
After his graduation from the University, Hen-
derson went on to Harvard Business School, where
he received a master's degree in business adminis-
tration before starting his career at GM.

For alcohol charge, Stonum

By JENNA SKOLLER
Daily StaffReporter
Michigan freshman wide receiv-
er Darryl Stonum was sentenced
to 12 months probation in Ann
Arbor's 15th District Court this
morning after pleading guilty to a
charge of operating a vehicle while
visibly impaired.

As par of the probation, District
Judge Julie Creal ordered Stonum
to attend substance abuse educa-
tion and a Mothers Against Drunk
Driving Victims Impact Panel.
Stonum was required to pay
funds and costs of $115, probation
oversight fees of $240 and a Uni-
versity Department of Public Safe-
ty fee of $100.
Stonum was also ordered to com-
plete three days of the Washtenaw
County Jail Community Work Pro-
gram.
"The Community Work Pro-
gram," according to ewashtenaw.
org, "provides an alternative to
incarceration for sentenced misde-

meanants and adult probationary
felons by coordinating and super-
vising their participation in com-
munity service activities."
Both Stonum and Director of
StudentLegal ServicesDougLewis,
who represented him, declined to
comment on the sentencing.
Stonum was arrested Sept. 28
around 4 a.m. after he was pulled
over on State Street near campus,
according to police reports. Stonum
was traveling at about 60 miles per
hour when he almost hit another car
crossing through the intersection at
State Street and Hill Street.

W COMMUNITY SERVICE
Boost in federal funding creates more
* AmeriCorps opportunities for students

UNIVERSITY RESEARCH
'U' scientist receives
top research award

New legislation will
allow organization
to increase capacity
to 250,000
By SARAH ZAWACKI
For the Daily
AmeriCorps, a service organi-
zation that focuses on picking up
some of this country's most down-
trodden communities, is getting a
helping hand from the federal gov-
ernment, in the form of a massive
boost in funding.
This increase in federal funds
to AmeriCorps will allow more
students from the University and
across the country to participate in
the program.
Late last month, Congress sent

legislation to President Barack
Obama's desk that will pump more
than $6 billion into community
service programs over the next five
years. Because of this boost in aid,
funding for AmeriCorps tripled,
allowing the organization's par-
ticipant capacity to increase from
75,000 to 250,000.
The bill, named after Sen.
Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.), will
provide for the largest expansion
of national service in 50 years.
AmeriCorps, which was created
by President Bill Clinton in 1993,
offers students over the age of 18 the
chance to live in subsidized hous-
ing and receive health care while
serving in communities around the
country. Following their service,
participants receive a financial
award to pay for college or graduate
school or to pay back loans.
The Edward M. Kennedy Serve

America Act will increase the
amount students receive for service
from $4,725 to $5,350, the maxi-
mum financial aid offered through
the Federal Pell Grant. The Ame-
riCorps award will also be tied to
the Pell Grant to match any future
increases in the financial aid.
Rep. George Miller (D-Calif.),
chairman of the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives Education and Labor
Committee, wrote in a press release
that the bill comes at an especially
important time, given the current
economic climate.
"History has shown that in times
of crisis, Americans turn to service
and volunteering for healing, for
rebuilding and for hope. The spirit
and generosity of the American
people is one of our nation's great-
est assets," he wrote. "This legis-
lation is just what we need, at this
pivotal moment, to get our nation

Ming Lei one of 50
researchers picked
in the country
By SHRUTI GANDHI
For the Daily
The Howard Hughes Medi-
cal Institute, a nonprofit medi-
cal research organization that
fosters some of the nation's most
promising young scientists, has
recently highlighted one of the
University's own.
Ming Lei, assistant profes-
sor of Biological Chemistry, was
presented with the Early Career
Physician-Scientist award earlier
this month. Lei was one of only
50 young scientists chosen from
around the country.
"I was the only one selected
from Michigan, so it is really a

great honor," Lei said.
In addition to his full salary
and benefits, Leiwill receive a six-
year appointment that includes
a $1.5 million budget and fund-
ing for equipment and research
space.
Lei said he will use the grant
money to continue his research
on DNA replication and its role
in biological functions, like the
acceleration of the aging process
and the survival of cancer cells.
In particular, Lei is working
to determine the structure of
molecules that build telomeres,
specialized regions that cover the
end of DNA and appear to play a
key part in both aging and cancer
cell replication.
"Studyingthe role of telomeres
is crucial for research related to
both cancer and aging," Lei said.

see the block M, warning
them not to step on it for fear
of failing their first blue book

it was the class of 1953 that

that, a Plant Department

to the Alumni Association's

" Hike on beer tax
would help support
welfare programs
A state-appointed task force
will recommend improvements
to Michigan's child welfare sys-
tem, including a way to raise more
money for abuse and neglect pre-
vention programs through a higher
beer tax.
The upcoming Michigan Child
Welfare Improvement Task Force
report was discussed yesterday by
state Department of Human Ser-
vices officials. A final report could
be out as early as next week.
The task force suggests improv-
ing prevention and family support
programs so fewer children get
placed in foster care or other pro-
grams outside of their homes. The
final report is expected to recom-
mend raising the beer tax and
putting the money into those pro-
grams.
The current Michigan beer
tax equals roughly 2 cents for a
12-ounce beer.

Meijer pulls pet toys
found to be infested
with worms
Midwestern retailer Meijer
has pulled a pet toy from its store
shelves after a customer said she
bought one that was infested with
worms.
Debbie Fitzgerald of New Era
says she bought a "Save My Plan-
et" pet toy in the shape of a ferret
at a Meijer store in Norton Shores,
just south of Muskegon.
She says she discovered the
worms when she got home.
Meijer Inc. officials told Grand
Rapids TV stations WZZM and
WOOD the item has been re-
moved from all of the retailer's
nearly 200 stores in Illinois, In-
diana, Kentucky, Michigan and
Ohio.
Meijer is based in Grand Rap-

comment were left yesterday at
the company.
WASHINGTON
U.S to attend group
talk with Iran on
nuclear weapons
The Obama administration
said Wednesday it will participate
directly in group talks with Iran
over its suspect nuclear program,
another significant shift from
President George W. Bush's policy
toward a nation he labeled part of
an axis of evil.
The State Department said
the United States would be at the
table "from now on" when senior
diplomats from the five perma-
nent members of the U.N. Security
Council and Germany meet with
Iranian officials to discuss the
nuclear issue. The Bush adminis-
tration had generally shunned such
meetings, although it attended one
last year.

"We believe that pursuing very
careful engagement on a range
of issues that affect our interests
and the interests of the world with
Iran makes sense," Secretary of
State Hillary Rodham Clinton told
reporters. "There is nothing more
* important than trying to convince
Iran to cease its efforts to obtain a
nuclear weapon."
WASHINGTON
Fed's action driven
byfears ofanew
recession low
The Federal Reserve's deci-
sion last month to plow $1.2 tril-
lion into the economy reflected
growing concerns about a vicious
economic cycle in which rising
unemployment will curtail con-
sumer spending, potentially into
2010.
Documents released yesterday
provided insights into the Fed's
decision to revive the economy
by buying long-term government
debt and boosting purchases of
mortgage-backed securities from
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
Projections for economic activity
in the second half of 2009 and in
2010 "were revised down" by the
Fed's staff, who did not provide
updated forecasts.
"Most participants viewed
downside risks as predominating
in the near term," according to
minutes of the Fed's closed-door
meeting on March 17-18.

Rob Simmons, who will challenge Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., for his Senate seat, talks to the Associated Press during an
interview irr Washington last week. Two years after losing his House seat by just 83 votes to Dodd, a feisty Simmons is back
in Washington taking aim at Dodd amid the financial tumult.
Simmons blasts Dodd
at Capitol Hill lu

Representative from
Connecticut angry
over senator's ties to
Wall Street
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
staid Capitol Hill Club dining
room was quiet. Except for Rob
Simmons.
Perched at a table at the popu-
lar Republican hangout blocks
from the Capitol, Simmons waved
a sheaf of newspaper clippings
about Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn.,
and his cozy Wall Street fundrais-
ing ties, his role in the economic
crisis and the billions of taxpayer
dollars spent to bail out banks.
"That's why the people are out
with the pitchforks," Simmons
said loudly, jabbing the air with a
finger. "People are upset."
When his raised voice turned a
few heads at nearby tables, Sim-
mons caughthimselfandshrugged
apologetically.
"I get a little excited," Simmons
said, chuckling.
"What I see is a sweetheart
deal, a sweetheart relationship
between the chairman of the Sen-

ate Banking Committee and the
people he oversees."
Two years after losing his
House seat by just 83 votes, a feisty
Simmons is back in Washington
and taking aim at Dodd amid the
financial tumult. Dodd's re-elec-
tion promises to be a marquee
race next year, and taking down a
major Democrat like Dodd could
be a coup for the Republicans.
Dodd, a five-term incumbent,
has soured many voters and found
himself vulnerable for several rea-
sons: his role in writinga bill that
protected bonuses for executives
at bailed-out insurer American
International Group Inc; his ini-
tial refusal to release documents
about his two controversial mort-
gages with Countrywide Finan-
cial Corp.; and his financing of a
vacation cottage in Ireland.
"I'm going to do my job," Dodd
has said. "Politics will take care of
itself, one way or the other in the
final analysis. And I'll either once
again earn the respect and confi-
dence of the people of this state, or
I won't."
Simmons bucks the trend in a
congressional climate flush with
lawyers and other buttoned-down
business types. The lanky former

three-term GOP congressman is
an ex-spy with a quirky, self-effac-
ing side. As a photographer in the
club clicks away, Simmons jok-
ingly asks if there's a way to add
"a little more hair" and make his
ears look thinner in the pictures.
Simmons, 66, pounced when
polls showed Dodd, 64, could be
vulnerable. Simmons believes he
faces an uphill fight against Dodd,
despite a recent Quinnipiac Uni-
versity poll that showed the sena-
tor's popularity at 33 percent, a
career low. Simmons is bracing
for a primary fight as well against
state Sen. Sam Caligiuri.
"Simmons is a goofy, awkward
guy who comes across as being
affable enough," said Roy Occhi-
ogrosso, a veteran Democratic
strategist and Dodd supporter.
But, Occhiogrosso said, Simmons'
aw-shucks personality belies the
hardball campaigning that tended
to surface in the closing days of his
congressional races.
Occhiogrosso noted there
were mailings and recorded tele-
phone messages to voters making
"ridiculous" charges against Sim-
mons' foes, but Simmons "would
disavow any knowledge of it or
refuse to talk about it."

Woman jailed in
Iran for two months
seeks quick release
TEHRAN, Iran (AP) - An
American journalist jailed for
more than two months in Iran
has been charged with spying for
the U.S., a judge said yesterday,
dashing hopes of a quick release
days after her parents arrived
in the country seeking her free-
dom.
The espionage charge is far
more serious than earlier state-
ments by Iranian officials that
the woman had been arrested for
working in the Islamic Republic
without press credentials and her
own assertion in a phone call to
her father that she was arrested
after buying a bottle of wine.
Roxana Saberi, who grew up
in Fargo, North Dakota, and is
a dual citizen of the U.S. and

Iran, has been living in Iran for
six years. She has reported from
there for several news organiza-
tions, including National Public
Radio and the British Broadcast-

A trend toward tolerance
All states should push for legalization of same-sex marriage
N ovember was a tough month for gay rights in this
country. Despite an election that ushered in a
Democratic Congress and this country's first black
president, states from California to Florida passed ballot
initiatives that curtailed gay rights, especially the right to
same-sex marriage. But in the past week, in Iowa, Vermont
and Washington, D.C., gay rights advocates scored a triple
victory in their fight to end discrimination in this coun-
try. The rest of the states in this country - including our
own state of Michigan - need to recognize the fact that
outlawing same-sex marriage is discriminatory, backward
and, frankly, wrong.

The importance of last week for gay
rights can't be overstated. In three differ-
ent regions of this country, through three
different means, the right to same-sex mar-
riage - the primary goal of many gay rights
activists - was affirmed. On Friday, Iowa's
Supreme Court issued a unanimous deci-
sion to remove a longstanding law against
same-sex marriage. Then, on Tuesday,
the Vermont state legislature overrode a
gubernatorial veto and passed a bill legal-
izing same-sex marriage - the first such
legislation in the country. The same day, the
Washington, D.C. City Council voted to rec-
ognize all same-sex marriages approved in
other states.
The denial of equal rights for same-sex
couples is one of the last vestiges of appar-
ent discrimination against a group of peo-
ple in this country. While other types of
discrimination undoubtedly exist, almost
no other discrimination is so shamelessly
perpetuated by government and codified in
law. Visitation rights for injured partners,
tax benefits and family health care are all
rights denied to same-sex couples simply
because they are gay. Like the Jim Crow
laws that denied blacks some of these same
rights, laws that deny same-sex couples
recognition as equals in our society are bla-
tantly discriminatory.
Though far from completely eliminating
this inequality, last week's developments
made quite a dent and are worth celebrating

in that regard. But they also highlight how
much more needs to be done.
Michigan is one such bastion for discrim-
ination. In 2004, Michigan voters approved
a constitutional amendment banning same-
sex marriage in this state. Since then, Mich-
igan's Attorney General Mike Cox and state
Supreme Court have used that amendment
as a blank check to discriminate against gay
people, incorrectly interpreting the amend-
ment to take away state employees' ability to
receive benefits for their partners. This fla-
grant abuse of power has affected everyone
in the state, including employees at the Uni-
versity of Michigan, who can still receive
benefits for a gay partner only because the
University has stretched the law to find a
loophole.
In states like Michigan, these discrimi-
natory laws have to go. Though the courts
have typically led the way in this fight (with
Vermont being the lone state in which a
legislature has had the courage to act),
citizens need to be at the forefront of this
movement. In fact, they have an obligation
to do so. When discrimination exists right
beneath one's nose, there's no excuse for
allowing it to continue. When history looks
back on these laws, they will be understood
the same way we now understand the bla-
tantly discriminatory Jim Crow laws.
That's a place in history neither Iowa,
Vermont nor Washington, D.C. want.
Neither should Michigan. Or this country.

n Mar. 22, a ship from a US
naval port in North Carolina
docked at Ashdod, Israel and
unloaded a cargo
of over 300 20-foot
containers laden
with munitions, E
bunker busting
bombs, white phos-
phorus and other
goodies. Never
mind that the
Bush administra- IBRAHIM
tion approved the
shipment one week KAKWAN
before Israel began
its Gaza offensive,
or that Israel has used white phos-
phorus, an incendiary, in civilian
areas.
Quite frankly, things like human
rights abuses or the unwavering
American support for Israel are
nothing new or even surprising.
What bothers me about this incident
is the total lack of media coverage it
received.
This news did not turn up on CNN,
NBC, BBC or any of the other usual
sources. Rather, Reuters made a note
of the incident, which I found on the
second page of a Google search.
When the United States claimed
to have discovered suspected Ira-
nian weapons in Iraq, it was all over
the news. The allegations were never
proven, and even though the "evi-
dence" amounted to little more than
a few beaten-up weapons on a table,
the story was everywhere. Even local
news broadcasts had their dumb,
overly made-up anchors circulat-
ing news that Iranian weapons had
been found in Iraq, complete with the
usual mispronunciations.
But if a few broken guns can cause
a stir and penetrate a large percent-
age of the national audience, how is
it that 14,000 tons of heavy weaponry
can go unnoticed?
I am nothinting at any specific bias
in favor of any particular country -
my issue is with the system as a whole.
In the last few months, unmanned

U.S. aircrafts have killed Pakistani
citizens in over 19 unauthorized vio-
lations of Pakistani airspace. This
does not make the evening news, but
we do hear that an obscure Pakistani
group threatened to attack the White
House.
A few months ago, American heli-
copters crossed into Syria, resulting
in more civilian deaths. Again, it was
not given much attention in American
news. And yet somehow we always
heard about alleged Syrian support
for Iraqi insurgents (which was never
proven).
My intention is not to criticize
the actions, but rather the reporting.
How can voters make an informed
decision based on such intentionally
partial knowledge?
A few days ago, someone ran-
domly asked me, "So when was the
last time the Palestinians messed
around with Israel? Is Yasser Arafat
dead?" He suggested the Al-Jazeera
English website, and he told me he
was "afraid to go on those websites."
Al-Jazeera is a news station partially
owned by the Qatari government,
the same government that hosts ele-
ments of the U.S. Central Command,
responsible for coordinating military
operations in the Middle East. There-
fore, by association, Al-Jazeera is not
very shady.
This person that I spoke with is
applying to (and has been offered)
positions in governmental agencies.
The scary part is that this person
already had a bias despite a clear lack
of background knowledge. It's also
the bias that this person will bring
when walking into that government
office on the first day of work. But
where did this bias come from?
If our future government workers
are afraid to see another perspec-
tive, then I can only wonder what
thought goes into crafting foreign
policy. Remember that in this lovely
democracy of ours, you only elect
the decision makers. Their advisors,
the people who write the reports on
which their decisions are based, are

hired.
And if those whovote feel that they
are constantly under attack, who do
they elect?
I heard a University bus driver
comment to a student that Iranian
president Mahmoud Ahmedinajad
reminded him "of a certain German
painter in the '30's" - an obvious
Hitler reference. When asked by the
student to support his statement, he
could not.
How biases in
American news
mislead the public.
If the driver had been able to sup-
port his statement, even though I
disagree, it would have represented
an opinion reached based on his own
assessment of facts. But'it turned out
to be nothing more than overly dra-
matic dribble, likely based on a con-
clusion already reached for him by
some newscaster.
A quick Google search of recent
news headlines containing the word
"Iran" is fraught with negative refer-
ences from American media outlets.
Only a couple articles from UK-based
Reuters and an Arab media company
discuss neutral economic issues and
do not point fingers at the country.
If, after probing just a little bit into
both sides of an issue, someone still
wants to bomb Iran, support Israel
or fly drones into Pakistan, that's
fine. But they should at least have the
opportunity to formulate that opin-
ion on their own, after hearing from
both sides.
But in a place where 14,000-ton
arms shipments do not merit coverage,
many are not given that opportunity.

Safe and concealed


Corn-fed equality

Whether the news of the day is a mass shoot-
ing or a fugitive's battle with police, this has
been a violent two weeks for America. Even in
Ann Arbor, there was a DPS crime alert about
the assault of a female student by an unknown
young male. Of course, we all remember hor-
rific incidents of violence at universities, like
the Virginia Tech massacre that occurred two
years ago next week. This crime was exactly the
sort of attack the annual "Take Back the Night"
rally intends to prevent.
All of these terrible occurrences show two
grim truths. First, bad things can happen any-
where, at any time, to any one of us. The sec-
ond is that we are responsible for our own
safety. The young woman who was attacked
makes this clear as she struggled and broke
free from her assailant. DPS and the Ann Arbor
Police Department cannot be everywhere at all
times.
Improving personal safety requires proac-
tive steps like being aware of one's surround-
ings and staying in well-lit areas. But despite all
the precautions a person might observe, crimes
will still be committed. In these situations,
forceful self-defense becomes necessary. The
trouble with self-defense is that college stu-
dents are often denied a highly effective tool
of self-defense: a concealed handgun. Suppose
the girl who was assaulted wasn't strong or for-
tunate enough to break free. If she was walk-
ing to or from campus, she was denied the right
to use the best tool of self-defense because of
state and University laws that make it a crime
for licensed gun owners to carry a concealed
handgun on campus. University policy also
imposes serious academic penalties. To present
an even worse situation, suppose there was a
mass shooting on campus. Because of misguid-
ed laws and policies, those who would other-
wise have been prepared to defend themselves
would be left unarmed and helpless.

Students for Concealed Carry on Campus is a
student organization working with universities
and state legislatures to allow students at pub-
lic universities who are licensed in accordance
with state law the ability to carry a concealed
pistol. The organization has 38,000 members
across the country, and the majority of the
members are students and faculty. The group
has successfully introduced legislation in mul-
tiple states and is continuing to grow since its
founding after the Virginia Tech massacre in
2007.
Allowing the concealed carry of pistols on
campus is not about arming every single col-
lege student, as many of the group's detractors
believe. The fact is, students are already armed.
Essentially anyone who is over 21, has no crim-
inal background and is mentally healthy can
qualify to obtain a Michigan Concealed Pistol
License. Many students have CPLs and own
firearms, and frequently carry all over Ann
Arbor. Statistically, these CPL - holding stu-
dents are among the most law-abiding segments
of the population. Unlike what many naysayers
believed when CPLs were first instituted, small
arguments haven't become firefights, nor have
police accidentally shot CPL holders when they
arrive on scene. In addition, ifa license-holder
is forced to draw a pistol in self-defense, they
are at least as likely to avoid hitting innocent
bystanders as most police forces. The only dif-
ference between Ann Arbor and the Univer-
sity campus in terms of carrying handguns is
an invisible legal line, which neither deters
criminals nor turns law-abiding students into
irresponsible armed drunks. RCockedemoving
this line would make the campus much safer
than people imagine it to be at the moment by
allowing students to exercise their right to self-
defense.

C onnecticut and Massachu-
setts, in all their liberal glory,
bewildered few when they
legalized same-sex
marriage. The rest
of the country prac-
tically expected it
of them. California,
too, was met with a
collective, sarcastic
"surprise, surprise""
when they began
issuing marriage MATTHEW
licenses to gay and
lesbian couples in GREEN
May 2008. Even
Vermont's legisla-
tive stride toward marital equality
this week was a longtime coming. But
at a time when states like Michigan
and Pennsylvania maintain bans on
gay marriage - and even California's
marriage policy is in legal flux - few
expected that the American gay com-
munity would have friends in Iowa.
Last Friday, the Iowa Supreme
Court upheld a District Court ruling
that same-sex couples should have no
legal barriers to marriage. Even more
surprisingly, all seven state Supreme
Court justices voted unanimously to
uphold the ruling. In similar court
cases in Connecticut and Massa-
chusetts, the justices were split 4-3.
Thus, on Apr. 3, in a historically
overwhelming legal decision, Iowa
became the only Midwestern state
to repeal constitutional or statutory
bans on gay marriage.
Politically speaking, that fact
shouldn't actually be so surprising.
Democrats outnumber Republicans
in both the state government and in
Iowa's delegation in Washington.
And during the season of presiden-
tial primaries, it was Iowa's sheer
progressivism that led to President
Barack Obama's caucus victory and
the momentum that carried him
through to the general election.

Admittedly, it seems alittle odd that
a gay couple is more legally entitled
in Des Moines than in, say, San Fran-
cisco, but Iowa's ruling is a great leap
in the right direction. Apart from the
three states that allow gay marriage
outright, only 12 states recognize or
permit same-sex civil unions - and
in the other 35, homosexuals who
want to marry their life-partners are
treated as second-class citizens.
California moved in a reverse
direction last November when it
passed Proposition 8, stripping LGBT
Californians of their right to marry.
The legality of that debate is current-
ly being argued before the California
Supreme Court, but the fact that the
initiative even passed is a testament
to the hatemongering of religious
zealots and a handful of ignorant oth-
ers.
According to CNN, 75 percent of
Americans believe LGBT individuals
should be entitled to equal rights for
housing, employment and protection
of the law. But despite this overall
tolerance, 55 percent still oppose gay
marriage. Some of that majority says
marriage is defined between a man
and a woman - a definition steeped
in antiquated Christian thought.
Sure, the United States is a nation
founded on many Christian princi-
ples, but what has set America apart
is its commitment toward separating
the Bible from the Constitution.
Moreover, what has really killed
the traditional definition of marriage
is the enormous divorce rate of Amer-
ican couples - which is somewhere
between 30 and 50 percent. Even if
all committed same-sex couples got
married, at 4 percent of the popula-
tion, gays don't pose as big a threat to
marriage as divorce.
Other opponents say the point of
marriage is to raise children, sug-
gesting that same-sex households are
unfit for child rearing. But the proper

reaction should be: "Gee, thank you,
gays and lesbians, for adopting the
children we don't want, loving them
and taking the burden off the govern-
ment." To be sure, growing up with
two moms or dads may not be normal
for children who developmentally
crave to be like everyone else, but it's
a lot better than growing up with-
out anyone. In order for children to
grow into normal, emotionally strong
adults, they don't need the conven-
tional father and mother. All they
Why gay marriage0
in Iowa is an
essential step.
need is to be raised by parents who
shower them with love. More than
other parents, gay and lesbian parents
can understand that because in order
for them to come out of the closet,
they needed tobe surrounded by love,
too. Here and across the board, oppo-
nents to gay marriage seem to ignore
that they are merely fighting love.
Iowa's recent stand should be a sig-
nal to the California Supreme Court
that change is imminent and vital,
illuminating that the only apparent
"abomination" was the language and
premise of Proposition 8. And most
importantly, the ruling should act as a
sort of refresh button for the national
perspective on gay rights. Just as Iowa
gave Obamathe needed momentumto
win the Democratic nomination, the
state's support of gay rights will hope-
fully stimulate a new tolerance that
finally grants much-overdue equal
rights.

" Michigan suffers third loss to a MAC team

Thursday, April 9, 2009 - 5A

By TIM ROHAN
Daily Sports Writer
A smorgasbord of Michigan
pitchers marched to the mound
yesterday for the Michigan base-
ball team, but no one could stop the
streak of bad pitching.
The Wolverines lost 10-2 to
Central Michigan, dropping their
record to 2-3 against teams from
the Mid-American Conference this
season. It was their worst loss to a
MAC team since a 14-0 loss to the
Chippewas in 2002.
"We lost a ton of guys (before
the season) and with that being
said, the MAC, they sense that,
they're no fools," Michigan coach
Rich Maloney said. "When I was
in the MAC, when I was a player, I
wanted to beat Michigan because I
wanted to go to Michigan. All those
guys wish they were at Michigan.
... That's the truth. So the reality is
they're coming ready to play."
In last Sunday's 16-S loss to Penn
State, Michigan exhausted its bull-
pen by using five relievers in five
innings. Freshman Brandon Sin-
nery, sophomore Travis Smith and
senior Mike Wilson all saw the
mound Sunday, and each pitched
yesterday, too.
Without a clear candidate to start
against the Chippewas (4-5 MAC,
14-17 overall), Michigan decided
to have a staff day. The Wolverines
relied on multiple pitchers for a few
innings at a time after starter Kevin
Vangheluwe went as far as he could.
Vangheluwe took the mound in
his first career start. He didn't last
e long - four runs and less than two
innings later, he was gone.
Six relievers were used after
the freshman was pulled from the
game.
"For us, we want to see a lot of
different guys anyhow, because,
quite frankly, we haven't been
pitching very well," Maloney said.
"So therefore we're waiting for
someone to step up."
Mishaps didn't help the reliev-
ers, who gave up six runs while they
tried to stop the bleeding. No pitch-
er recorded more than five outs.

Senior Mike Wilson was one of seven pitchers who gave up a combined 12 hits in yesterday's 10-2 loss to CentralvM

Maloney said one bright spot
was the pitching of sophomore
Kolby Wood, who had "nasty" stuff.
Wood pitched 1.2 perfect innings
and struck out three batters.
Central Michigan's freshman
pitcher Rick Dodridge effectively
controlled the Wolverine batters.
Dodridge shined despite entering
the game with a 5.96 earned run
average. Michigan (3-3 Big Ten,
18-11) managed just five hits off him
in over six innings of work.
"It's a huge momentum swing to
have to comeback from a deficit,"
senior Kevin Cislo said. "The first

team that scores usually wins. We
have to find a way to shut down
teams early in the game and have
our offense pick it up. We haven't
been able to do that all year."
Nothing was going right for
Michigan. Even when the ball was
playable, the Wolverines had a few
miscues which could have made
their night easier. The defense had
two official errors and many other
possible plays were not executed.
Michigan failed to make the plays
on defense, at the plate and on the
mound that were necessary to avoid
another loss to a MAC team.

Michigan's only loss to a MAC
team last year came against Central
Michigan on Apr. 4, when the Chip-
pewas scored seven unanswered
runs. The Wolverines have lost six
of its last 10 games, and after yes-
terday's loss, their problems are
getting worse.
"It's not that the guys aren't try-
ing," Maloney said. "They may even
be trying more than they should be
trying. I don't know. But right now
it's more psychological than it is
anything else. It's not the opponent
- we are the opponent. We're beat-
ing ourselves."

ichigan defeats

straight time
By MARK BURNS
Daily Sports Writer

EAST LANSING - It took
Michigan's men's tennis junior
George Navas three hard-fought
sets to defeat Michigan State's
Ronnie Hulewicz yesterday.
But Hulewicz's actions after
losing at No. 5 singles told the real
story of the day.
Following the loss, the Spartan
freshman walked to the backdrop
behind his court and grabbed his
towel. After shaking hands with
Navas and the umpire, Hulewicz
plopped down on a nearby bench
and buried his head in the towel
for a couple minutes.
Hulewicz's display epitomized
the match as the Wolverines dis-
mantled the Spartans, 7-0, at the
Michigan State Indoor Tennis
Facility.
"We don't want to take any-
one lightly, but (Michigan) coach
(Bruce Berque) really wanted
us to be competitive in today's
match," junior Mike Sroczynski
said. "Getting another win on the
road definitely helps the team's
confidence."
After the teams split the first
two doubles matches, the doubles
point rested on the shoulders of
Sroczynski and senior co-captain
Peter Aarts.
Because the Spartans (0-7
Big Ten, 12-10 overall) defeated
Michigan in doubles the previous
two seasons, Berque said he urged
Michigan to play with "energy"
and "hunger" because he knew
its in-state rival would come out
strong.
Sroczynski and Aarts stayed
 composed and poised, battling
for each point to escape with an
8-6 victory and the doubles point
for the Wolverines (3-4, 9-13).
Sroczynski was easily the biggest
and strongest player on the court
for both teams, using his serve to
overpower the Spartans.
"We definitely want the guys
to use their serves as weapons,"
Berque said. "But we also want
to manage them and make a lot

of high-percentage first serves in
singles and doubles. When we do
that, we have a good chance of
winning."
After grabbing the doubles
point for the Wolverines, Sroc-
zynski's serve and return game
were too strong for the Spartans
at the No. 3 singles position. He
defeated his opponent in straight
sets, 6-4, 6-4.
"On days like this, when I can
serve well, there's really nothing
(my opponent) can do," Sroczyn-
ski said. "I was hitting my spots
really well."
Berque said Sroczynski hadn't
been playing his best tennis
earlier in the season but he has
improved considerably in the past
few weeks.
Navas and senior Andrew Maz-
lin used multiple aces in their
three-set singles victories to help
the team beat the Spartans for the
fifth straight time.
Michigan will hope to use its
service game next Sunday at Pur-
due to force the Boilermakers to
bury their faces into a few more
white towels.
"It's easier when you have
that 'W' behind you in the locker
room," sophomore Chris Mad-
den said. "You can celebrate a
little bit and believe in yourself
again."

It's a tradition duringthe Jewish
holiday of Passover to eat unleav-
ened bread.
But hours before the holiday
began at sunset yesterday, the
Michigan softball team's bats
appeared to be observing Passover
early. Eventually, the offense rose
to life in the Wolverines' 7-2 win at
Central Michigan.
The Chippewas (1-7 Mid-Amer-
ican Conference, 7-19 overall)
jumped out to an early 1-0 lead as
pitcher Ali Pettit hung on by throw-
ingballs low. Central Michigan held
a slim lead until the sixth inning,
when junior outfielder Angela Find-
lay found her swing and belted a
two-run homer over the left-center
wall of Margo Jonker Stadium.
"I was just going up there to hit
the ball hard," Findlay said. "We
had just talked about keeping our
eyes down on the ball."
Findlay's blast was just the
beginning. Sparked by a five-run
seventh inning, the eighth-ranked
Wolverines extended their win
streak to seven.
Freshman second baseman
Stephanie Kirkpatrick, who made
her first appearance in the lead-
off spot, was the lone Wolverine
to consistently reach base. Michi-
gan coach Carol Hutchins said
the lineup switch was a trial but
hinted that it could reappear in the

future.
The move paid off. Michigan
(4-2 Big Ten, 27-9) had three hits
before the sixth inning - and two
were Kirkpatrick's.
"I like being in the leadoff spot,"
said Kirkpatrick, who hit leadoff in
high school. "It felt like I was back
home in my spot. It wasn't differ-
ent. I'll fake any spot, but it was
comfortable being up at the top."
Sophomore first basemanDorian
Shaw's first-inning fielding error
led to Michigan's early 1-0 deficit.
With two errors in Wednesday's
game, Michigan has committed
five errors in its past three games.
The Wolverines have committed
four errors in their three midweek
games this season.
"We definitely need to play
some better defense," Hutchins
said. "We gave up a run in the first
inning, but we didn't let it lead to
big innings. ... It's just not concen-
trating and not staying focused on
the ball and the moment."
The single game was a rare
break from the new schedule of
midweek doubleheaders in Big Ten
games. The Wolverines insist they
are not fatigued by the new amount
of both nonconference and confer-
ence games on Wednesdays.
And despite their fielding
errors, the final result is still the
same - wins. Of their three mid-
week games, their lowest margin
of victory was yesterday's five-run
contest.

Michigan volleyball coach Mark
Rosen knew he wanted to take his
team on a spring trip, but he didn't
know where.
China and Europe were pos-
sibilities. But while recruiting a
player from Iowa Western Com-
munity College - of all places
- last year, Rosen finally had his
destination: Brazil.
At IWCC, Rosen found Juliana
Paz, a Porto Alegre, Brazil native.
Paz eventually committed to the
Wolverines, and Rosen and his
coaching staff decided to finalize
a plan that had been a few years in
the making.
"We had been talking about this
group of players going on a foreign
trip," Rosen said. "You want to do
it on a year where you have a lot of
returners."
Michigan returns all but two
players from last season's Sweet
Sixteen squad, so this was an ideal
time for the Wolverines to take a
trip.
With Paz on the roster, it was an
obvious move to head to Sao Paulo
and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil from
May 17-29.
Theteam will play six Brazilian
club teams in a 10-day stretch.
"Brazil tends tobe a little faster
pace, and they focus on defense
and ball control," Rosen said.
"They playjust aggressive defense,
keeping balls alive. It'll force us to
play at a much higher level."
Offensively, foreign competi-
tion is more "outside dominated,"
according to junior right side hit-
ter Megan Bower.
Setters tend to serve their hit-
ters on the sidelines instead of in
the middle of the court or out of
the back row.
And the attitude is different,
too.
"They're very passionate about
how they play, and they play very
externally," Rosen said. "In our
country, if someone says some-
thing through the net, you get a
little offended.
"That's commonplace there,
and it'll be interesting to see how
our kids handle that confronta-
tion."

Ahe ACu

DIFFERENT CULTURE,
DIFFERENT WORLD
The Wolverines will see a whole
different culture in Brazil.
In Brazil, teams don't have a lot
of money or funding, so players
compete in dirty, leaky facilities
that don't look like the state-of-
the-art volleyball courts here.
"We're a first-world country,
and they're third world." Rosen
said. "But in volleyball, (skills-
wise), it's the exact opposite."
Paz, a junior, will essentially be
a tour guide for her teammates and
coaches.
"Juliana is going to be able to
give us an inside view, rather than
getting maybe the superficial side
of the country," Rosen said.
For the past few weeks, the out-
side hitter has tried to teach her
teammates about her native coun-
try. Bower said the team has been
learning different words every
day, like "please," "thank you," and
" excuse me."
"Juliana has been laughing at
us all the time," sophomore setter
Lexi Zimmerman said. "It's funny
from her point of view because
she'll screw up English words, and
everyone will be like 'Ooohhh'
And now we're butchering some
of these words and she's getting a
kick out of it, too."
THE NEXT STEP
Other Big Ten teams have
recently embarked on internation-
al trips. Purdue and Illinois trav-
eled to Europe last year.
Illinois showed a big improve-
ment after the trip. The Fighting
Illini went from 16-14 in 2007 to
a third-place finish in the Big Ten
with a 26-8 record last season.
Purdue won seven more games last
season than the year before.
"You usually see teams take a
surge the year they go on these
trips," Rosen said.
Rosen has seen his team's win
totals increase in each of the last
three seasons. And with much of
last year's team still intact, the trek
to Brazil could be what Michigan
needs to cement itself in the upper
echelon of the Big Ten.
"This trip could be what puts us
over the hump next year," Rosen
said.

volunteers. This increase comes
at an opportune time, as student-
targeted service programs like
National Student Partnerships, a
non-profit organization focused
on combating poverty, begin run-
ning into funding trouble.
Addell Anderson, program
director of the Michigan Ameri-
Corps Partnership, said the funding
increase has benefited many stu-

police administered at the scene
showed Stonum's blood alcohol
content to be at .10. In the state of
Michigan, it is illegal for a minor
to operate a vehicle with a BAC
of .02 or higher. Stonum was 18 at
the time of the incident.
Stonum could have potentially
faced up to 93 days in jail, $300 in
fines and 360 hours of community
service for the offense.
Because of a "violation of team
rules," Michigan head football
coach Rich Rodriguez suspended

dents by allowing more of them to
have summer service internships.
"Before, fewer students would
have had an opportunity to do
that," she said.
Anderson said the boost in
funding will help AmeriCorps
expand its collaboration with the
Semester in Detroit program here
at the University. She said the
group's common affiliation with
the Ginsberg Center, a campus
organization dedicated to service
learning, is a good foundation for
partnership in the future.

game against Illinois. Stonum
was not disciplined further in
addition to this one-game sus-
pension.
During his weekly Big Ten tele-
conference on Nov. 4, the day of
Stonum's arraignment, Rodriguez
said Stonum would not face any
further discipline
Stonum did play but didn't start
in the team's next game against
Toledo.
Stonum started at wide receiv-
er in the rest of the Wolverines'
12 games last season. During the
season, he made 14 catches for 176
yards and one touchdown.

HENDERSON
From Page lA
dirt, said he knew there was "just
something very special about (Hen-
derson)" since the first time they
met.
"I thought he had a marvelous
personality," Benedict said. "Always
had a smile on his face even though
when you see the pictures of him in
the paper you wouldn't believe that.
He was a very delightful young man
and was a joy to have on the team."
Benedict said those qualities
should help Henderson transform
GM, explaining that humor, enthu-
siasm and a positive personality "are
great qualities not only in an athlete
but in an executive."
"He obviouslyknows the business
and wherever they had trouble they
would send him," Benedict said. "I
speak very highly of him."
Others on campus see Hender-
son's professional experience as
the main factor in his ability to suc-
ceed at GM both as a leader and as
a reformer. That experience, some
say, is a mixed blessing.
Business Prof. Gerald Meyers,

who knows Henderson and his
predecessor Rick Wagoner person-
ally, said he has faith in Henderson's
ability to lead.
"He is a superb executive," he
said. "He is very well rounded and
has very rich experiences. It's a plus
because he is capable and experi-
enced and will do a good job. It's a
minus because he is just another
guy out of the GM mold."
Hendersonhas worked for most of
his career at GM. He served as vice
president and managing director of
GM Brazil before being appointed
president of GM-LAAM, which cov-
ers Latin America, Africa and the
Middle East. Hewas later appointed
president of GM Asia Pacific, where
he opened operations in Korea and
China in 2002. He served as chair-
man of GM Europe until he became
president and chief operating officer
of GM in 2008.
Business Prof. Martin Zimmer-
man, a former group vice president
of Ford Motor Co., said it's impor-
tant to note that Wagoner and Hen-
derson have worked closely together
and that the switch is a change in
pace but "not a radical change in
direction."

While many people may be con-
fident about Henderson's ability,
Zimmerman said Wagoner's depar-
ture from the company was "largely
symbolic."
"Wagoner was a good executive,"
he said. "I think that that was the
(Obama) administration indicat-
ing that they're getting tough and
demanding change."
Though he was the object of
the Obama administration's tough
stance, Wagoner expressed confi-
dence in his replacement's abilities,
according to a press release.
"Having worked closely with
Fritz for many years, I know that
he is the ideal person to lead the
company through the completion of
our restructuring efforts," Wagoner
wrote. "His knowledge of the glob-
al industry and the company are
exceptional, and he has the intellect,
energy and support among GM'ers
worldwide to succeed."
Bruce Belzowski, associate direc-
tor of the Automotive Analysis
Division at the University Transpor-
tation Research Institute, said Wag-
oner's resignation was "inevitable."
He added, however, that he wasn't
sure if Henderson is "in any better

position than Wagoner to turn GM
around."
That turnaround has been the
focus of Henderson's job during the
past week.
Last Tuesday, Henderson issued
a statement on the topic, saying,
"fundamental and lasting changes
are necessary to reinvent GM for the
long-term."
"We have significant challeng-
es ahead of us, and a very tight
timeline," Henderson wrote. "I
am confident that the GM team
will succeed, and that a stronger,
healthier GM will play an impor-
tant role in revitalizing America's
economy and re-establishing its
technology leadership and energy
independence."
Zimmerman said that whether
or not the company goes into bank-
ruptcy, a lot of sacrifices and chang-
es are going to have to be made for
the company to survive.
"GM is going to be a smaller com-
pany," he said. "There are going
to be sacrifices on various parties
and hopefully GM will survive
as a business and keep producing
auto mobiles, but in a lot smaller
amount."

receive funding.
"The primary reason for this
award is to help junior faculty do

high-risk and potentially high-
impact research," he said.
When scientists at the begin-
ning of their careers run out of
start-up funds from their institu-
tion, the pressure to acquire mon-
ies from federal grant institutes
often forces them to write pro-
posals that are safe and reliable,
instead of more forward-thinking
initiatives.

"The current climate of fund-
ing from the government is not
very good, so that can place limits
on potential research projects that
(scientists) can propose," Lei said.
"You have to be really conservative
to get funding."
The Howard Hughes Medi-
cal Institute is different in that it
selects finalists for funding based
on a "people not projects" phi-

losophy, allowing the early career
.scientists to explore various possi-
bilities and even change the entire
course of their research.
Lei said he is "so excited to have
received this award," and looks
forward to continuing his research
on "how telomeres fulfill their two
functions, and hopefully discover-
ing their application in cancer pre-
vention."

attend the University, because Arab
or Arab American is not considered
an ethnic or racial group onthe Uni-
versity's admissions application.
But according to the Arab Ameri-
can Institute's website, "Michigan
is home to the highest concentra-
tion of Arab Americans in any
state," with 490,000 Arab Ameri-
cans callingthe state home.
Another factor contributingto the
on-campus debate may be religion.
Sociology Prof. Fatma Muge
Gocek said in addition to demo-
graphics, the religious diversity on
campus greatly influences the dia-
logue amongstudents.
"A lot has to do with Islam as

well; Islam vs. Judaism and the civ-
ilization of the two," Gocek said. "I
think you do have various intersec-
tions of culture, ideology, security,
and war, (and) those things all come
together in various imports in sig-
nificantways. And we have so many
student organizations on campus
that they are already - because of
their particular age group - are
immediately mobilized regardless,
whatever the group may be."
A third factor may be students'
political ideologies.
History Prof. and Middle Eastern
Studies expert Juan Cole said that
the discourse does not extend from
purely racial or ethnic demograph-
ics of the student body, but rather a
difference in ideology between lib-
eral and conservative students on
campus.

"So I think in some ways it's a
human rights thing from the point
of view of the campus left," Cole
said. "On campus, the stateless-
ness and the victimhood, (and) the
way they're being blockaded is per-
ceived as an outrage."
Rachel Goldstein, chair of the
American Movement for Israel, the
largest pro-Israel group on campus
also said the discourse surround-
ing the Israeli-Palestinian con-
flict stems from historical trends
of active debates surrounding-the
issue at the University. She points
to a series of demonstrations and
events that took place on campus
in the fall of 2000 at the start of the
Second Intifada as an example of
those trends.
"I think Michigan has a repu-
tation of having a lot of dialogue
and a lot of discourse about the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict going
on, on campus,' Goldstein said.
"(The activism during the Second
Intifada) gave the University a bit
of a reputation for being ashot be
of pro-Israel or pro-Palestinian
activism. Because both sides were
very active at that point and it ren-
dered national attention."
Ben Kaminsky, chair of Israel
Initiating Dialogue, Education
and Advocacy, another pro-Israel
student group, said the opposing
sides of the conflict within the Ann
Arbor community and their vocal
opinions at various University
organization-sponsored events is
also a contributing factor to the
debate on campus.
Andrew Dalack, co-chair of
Students Allied for Freedom and
Equality, a pro-Palestinian group
on campus, said the main reason
for dialogue surrounding the issue
is because students are concerned
about the situation in the Middle
East, and are focused on rais-
ing awareness for the Palestinian
cause.
Kamelya Youssef, chair of the
Arab Student Association, said
that while the large Jewish, Arab
and Muslim student populations
do greatly impact the discourse on
campus, she does not consider the
conflict to be a religious matter,
but rather a political issue.
Youssef said the interest in the
conflict has inspired the Univer-
sity's Program on Intergroup Rela-
tions to develop a dialogue course
on the Arab-Israeli conflict for the
upcomingfall semester.
Youssef, along with two other
Arab student organization leaders
and two Jewish students, and offi-
cials from the Program on Inter-
group Relations, are creating this
dialogue course in order to create
better understanding between the
two diverse groups on campus.
"This will be something to talk
about the Arab-Jewish dynamic
on campus as well as talking about
theirnationalissues,"Youssefsaid.
"We're taking a big problem on our
shoulders and saying how are we
going to make the campus envi-
ronment better, how are we going
to make people better understand
eachother,how are wegoingtojust
start a dialogue between them."

ianists in studios and
tu ic.schools often
collaborate to perform
all 32 of Beethoven's
piano sonatas. But just one man
performing all 32 over a two-year
period? That's exactly what the
ambitious pianist Andras Schiff
is doing.
This weekend, the celebrated
Schiff will give the 7th and 8th
concerts in his Beethoven Sonata
Project at Hill Auditorium, pre-
senting sonatas 27 through 32. It's
a daunting enterprise. Sonata 29 is
the famed - and feared - "Ham-
merklavier," Beethoven's longest
and, some say, most difficult piano
sonata. Each sonata is experimen-
tal, distinct and an undeniably
masterful accomplishment.
But if anyone is up to the task,
it's Schiff. He's a Grammy award-
winner, a star-quality interpreter
and a dexterous virtuoso. Echoing
his current project, he tackled all
of Mozart's 27 piano concertos
between 1999 and 2005. And, as is
easily presumed, he has no trouble
with difficult technique. His per-
formances are precise, impeccable
and, in the words of The New
York Times, "luminary."
The University's School of
Music, Theatre & Dance has
endeavored to take the great leap
in exploring Beethoven's sonatas,
stretching boundaries with the
Sonata Obsession series. In the
past two years, the Obsession
series has featured graduate stu-
dents from the piano performance
program playing, as a group, all of
Beethoven's piano sonatas. And
the students have gone one step

further: They've added

The idea to do a parallel

the School of Music.

FILM
A three-disc DVD set
seems a little exces-
sive for one film, even
if that film is 2007
Best Picture Oscar
winner "No Country
for Old Men." Still,
this new release of
the bizarre and bloody
Coen Brothers thriller
is worth picking up, as
it includes a number
of special features not
available on the initial
DVD release, includ-
ing a "digital copy"
able to be stored on
your computer. Now
you can watch Anton
Chigurh flip coins on
your iPod all day.

"nicknamed" sonata
(the Pathetique, the
Appassionata, etc.)
somewhere in the
program in order to
appeal to the crowd.
By playing all
of the sonatas in
chronological order,
Schiff presents the
"strongest possible
sense of Beethoven's
gradual maturation
and development as a
composer, using this
genre as a window.
And you can't get that
kind of picture if you
have an early, middle,
late work on every
program," Whiting
said.
Schiff's audience
also gets a chance to
hear sonatas rarely
played anywhere else.
It's a different win-
dow into Beethoven's
works - which is
what classical musi-
cians, especially
students, strive to
achieve with every
piece of music they
encounter. Schiff is an
innovator, producing
o/Daily older music in cre-

ment as unsuccessful or unin-
teresting. Understanding how
Beethoven's works progressed.
from his early efforts to his late
masterpieces is a great undertak-
ing, but the series context makes
it a more manageable task.
"Chronological order is the first
step (in) beginning to think about
causation," Whiting said. "We
have to know what happened first
and what happened second to see
what happened between them.
The Sonata Obsession series
capitalizes on the understanding
process by filling in the blanks
between the piano sonatas.
Beethoven certainly didn't
compose absentmindedly, nor did
he write only piano sonatas at any
given time. He often worked on
pieces of several different types at
once. Piano sonatas, collaborative
sonatas and even symphonies may
have evolved concurrently.
By having students perform the
works that fit between the piano
sonatas, the Sonata Obsession
series makes a broader look pos-
sible and provides more insight
into the texture of Beethoven's
work for piano.
The Sonata Obsession series

A notable Ann Arborite gives five
answers to a curious question.
Michael Rodemer
Associate Professor, School of Art & Design
What five artists influence you most?
RICHARD FEYNMAN: What's interesting for me about Feynman was not
so much that he was a Nobel Prize-winning physicist, but that he lived his life
with gusto, which is something to aspire to.
WALT WHITMAN: I think that what I get from him is that I love the power
of his words and images - the amazing, towering constructions of words. Some
of which are actually quite pedestrian, buthe uses them to create images that are
quite moving.
E.E. CUMMINGS: Again, it's his truth to his idiosyncratic self, which was
very idiosyncratic. He made sense out of the nonsensical. From him, I also
learned about partialness. Partial image descriptions can be enough.
ROBERT IRWIN: He's also another person thatthoughtvery hard about art
and life and vision. He developed his own way of engaging in those, stuck it out
and made things happen.
FREDERICK CHOPIN: I don't know much about him personally, but when
I listen to his music I thinkI do. It's so powerful and rich and moving that Iwish
I knew more.

Tweeting away the
gossip rags

Students of the stage

Sniff. Sorry, sorry. I promised myself
I wouldn't cry. This is officially my
last gossip column and, since TMZ
hasn't returned my phone calls, probably
my last chance to
write about this stuff
for a mass audience.
I'd like to give myself
a nice, self-serving
sendoff, but, given this
column's unsentimen-
tal nature - plus the
fact I'm sure no one MARK
cares I'm leaving - it SCHULTZ
just wouldn't be appro-
priate.
So instead I'll complain about the newest
trend in Hollywood: celebrity twittering.
I'm not talking about the tweets of David
Gregory and every politician from Barack
Obama to Chris Dodd. What irks me are
the tweets of gossip media stalwarts like
Lindsay Lohan, Heidi Montag and Ash-
ton Kutcher, all of whom use them as just
another way to call attention to themselves.
But I'm not here to join the anti-Twitter
squad whose complaints are just as dumb
as those of people who freaked out over
the redesign of Facebook. Reading about
the pithy moments of someone's day -
celebrity or not - isn't interesting to me,
so I simply don't visit Twitter or tweet
myself. Problem solved.
Or not. Because, unfortunately, it
appears Twitter is having an unforeseen
effect on celebrity feuds and liaisons.
Exhibit A: Lilo and Samantha Ronson,
freshly broken-up, found themselves in
adjoining rooms at the Chateau Marmont.
Hohan, annoyed by her ex's proximity,
tweeted the following: "PLEASE leave
me ALONE. And stop staying in the room
below me." All well and good. I cherish
this kind of animosity, especially from two
of this column's favorite subjects. But the
feud hasn't gone any farther than that. I
don't know, maybe Ronson tweeted some-
thing back. Whoop-de-do.
Now let's imagine an alternate, Twitter-
less universe. Given Lohan's impulsive
and thoughtless nature, I'd imagine she
would've had no choice but to break into
Ronson's room with a fireman's ax and
shriek like a banshee. (This is probably one
of the only times I'll ever use a clich6 in
writing, but it's appropriate because a ban-
shee is actually a ghastly Irish female. Like
Lohan.) But instead she just twittered.
See the problem here? New modes of
social technology are shouldering the
burden of celebrity anger, and tiffs that
once would've escalated into violent
public scenes now float harmlessly into
cyberspace.
I also believe Twitter makes celebrities
1 less creative. Exhibit B: On April Fool's Day
last week, Heidi Montag tweeted a pre-
dictably lame fake-out, announcing to the

world: "I wanted to tell my Twitter friends
first ... I am pregnant!!!!!!!! I couldn't be
more excited!!! I hope it's aboy!" Without
the abilityto quickly spread any bit of info
across the Internet, Heidi would've had to
fool the actual paparazzi - maybe donning
a fake stomach ache or scheduling a fake
appointment at the gynecologist's office.
But tweeting has removed the paparazzi
middlemen and allowed information to
flow directly from celebs' Blackberrys to
our unfortunate screens. The result is not
only uncreative, uninteresting pranks like
Heidi's but an erosion of one of the corner-
stones of gossip: the thrill of not knowing.
When a celebrity can tell you everything
herself, does the world need writers like
me to speculate? (I know, I know. The
world doesn't need me anyway.) So I'll
admit the motive behind this last column
is somewhat self-interested. I implore you,
lovers of gossip: Stop readingcelebrity
tweets, so that my replacement (should one
arise) can keep his or her job. (And so my
chances to runa successful Superficial-like
site will rise from .01 percent to .05.)
Straight from the
stars' Blackberrys.
In all fairness, though, I can't totally
condemn a technology that saves lives.
Even if the life happens tobea huge fan of
Demi Moore. It's true - last week a girl in
Silicon Valley twittered a suicide threat to
Demi-Tractor Trailer, who then re-twit-
tered it (a phrase I may have just made up)
to her legions of twittering fans, many of
whom called local police departments.
Still, stories like that are sandwiched
between less inspiring tales: John Mayer
likes Twitter more than Jennifer Anis-
ton; Hugh Jackman professes his Twitter
addiction, while Robert Pattinson wants
no part of it. Not only the contents of celeb-
rities' tweets but the fact that they twitter
at all has suddenly become tabloid fodder.
This article alone certainly broke the
Daily record for times "twitter" and its
conjugations has/will ever be used in print.
Like I said earlier, the word "twitter" has
a ton of old definitions, one of which is "a
state of tremulous excitement." I think
that describes things pretty well.
Like the inventor of a flyingcar, celebri-
ties seem to be more excited by the idea of
their new technology than the technology
itself. But it'll wear off. Twitter maybe
ephemeral, but gossip, my friends, lasts
forever.
Shultz really wants a job asa gossip
columnist. If you know of any job openings,
e-mail them to him at markthos@umich.edu.

Basement Arts and RC
Players are staples of
performance on campus
By RHIANNON HALLER
Daily Arts Writer
The University's Department of The-
atre & Drama puts on several well-attend-
ed, big budget productions a year, giving
students an opportunity to perform in
and to watch quality shows. Unfortu-
nately, the attention received by those
productions means that student-run per-
formances are often overlooked.
Student theater groups like Basement
Arts and RC Players give students of all
majors a chance to participate in every
facet of putting on a theatrical produc-
tion. They also provide students with free
or low-cost entertainment almost every
weekend.
Basement Arts got its start on the cor-
ner of Washington Street and State Street
in the old Frieze Building. In its basement
was a storage closet used by the Depart-
ment of Theatre & Drama. A group of stu-
dents looking for a place to practice and
perform its own productions thought the
room might be a suitable venue for a new
theater. The department liked the idea,
and in 1987 the students formed a stu-
dent theater group called Basement Arts,
turning the storage closet into the Arena
Theatre.
Although the Frieze Building and the
Arena Theater are no more, the Basement
Arts theater group is still going strong.
The group now rehearses and performs
in Studio One, a theater in the Walgreen
Drama Center on North Campus.
The RC Players puts on entirely stu-
dent-run performances as well.
While Basement Arts is mostly known
among the North Campus crowd, RC
Players productions are more popular
on Central Campus. Both student groups
are open to all students from all schools
at the University. They find most of their
actors and directors through advertising
at events like Festifall, creating posters
and using basic word-of-mouth publicity.
For Basement Arts, directors who
want their work to be performed must
go through a proposal process. Meaghan
Shelley, a senior in the School of Music,
Theatre & Dance and Basement Arts's
artistic director, wrote in an e-mail inter-
view that the group usually gets about 15
proposals a semester.
The performances produced by Base-
ment Arts are wide-ranging in themes
and authors. In the past, they have pro-
duced a play based on the novels of J.R.R.
Tolkien, musicals and plays written by
students and pieces written by profes-
sional authors. Last weekend, Basement
Arts put on "Donut Play (With Guns)"
written by New York author Addison
Proctor. Shelley thought it was one of the

Basement Arts players rehearse for an upcoming performance.

group's more notable productions.
"Basement Arts was the very first com-
pany to produce this show in its entirety,"
she said. "The author was in town for a
few rehearsals and the final performance,
where he and the cast held a talk back
after the show where audience members
could ask questions."
While Basement Arts and the RC Play-
ers have their similarities, they occupy dif-
ferent niches in the University community.
RC Players tend to have a larger number of
non-theater majors. In contrast, according
to Darren Criss, a Music, Theatre & Dance
senior, Basement Arts is comprised almost
entirely of theater majors, despite also
being open to all majors.
Criss, who has participated in Base-
ment Arts productions as both an actor
and director, wishes that more people
would take advantage of this opportuni-
ty. He views Basement Arts as a "hidden
gem," and said that he's always incred-
ibly excited when he finds out people who
aren't theater majors are in the audience.
Both Basement Arts and RC Players
currently face obstacles, though.
While Basement Arts has been moved
to Studio One after the Frieze Build-
ing was demolished, Shelley finds that
the studio space is a bit confining for the
group.
"In the Walgreen Drama Center, we
have a brand new theater that is not only
used by Basement Arts, butby faculty and
students for classes during the day," Shel-
ley said.
She added, "We are also more limited
in terms of rehearsal space, because we
share with University Productions."

Space issues have put a damper on the
number of shows Basement Arts can per-
form per semester. Additionally, the move
to North Campus has made it harder to
attract students from Central Campus to
shows due to both distance and advertis-
ing difficulties.
The RC Players have to deal with insuf-
ficient performance conditions as well.
"The East Quad Auditorium is really
run down, and we've had trouble with our
lights and sound boards," Gray wrote in an
e-mail interview. "It was supposed to be
renovated over the summer, but the proj-
ect was postponed until this summer."
The group has alsobeen having trouble
finding new blood,
"A lot of our students are graduating
this year, and we need to work on getting
our name out there so more people can
join our group," Gray said.
Despite the difficulties, the studentssee
their performance groups as an integral
part of the theater scene at the University.
Basement Arts andRC Players provide stu-
dents with a chance to see fantastic pro-
ductions on weekends without traveling
far or completely emptying their wallets.
All Basement Arts shows are free, as are
the majority of RC Players productions.
Gray sees student theater not only as
an enjoyable hobby, but as a real commit-
ment.
"We may be a bunch of people who
don't necessarily want to commit our
lives to theater, but when we put on a
show, we do it for real," she said. "We
produce really quality performances, and
we've created an incredible community
through doing so."

ST T L OUTKAST 'ATLIENS' (1996)

As original as hip hop can be

By JEFF SANFORD
DailyArts Writer
It's as true now as it was 15
years ago: OutKast is the cool-
est motherfucking band on the
planet. For proof, let's turn to
the mastermind behind the out-
fit, Andre 3000. Who else can get
away with asking "What's cooler
than being cool?" while standing
on stage wearing a WASPy argyle
sweater vest and a pink bow tie?
And who can actually receive a
wave of ecstatic response because
of those comments? Not even the
seemingly infallible Lil Wayne
could pull that one off.
Even from the beginning, Out-
Kast just seemed to get every-
thing right. The group's debut,
1994's Southernplayalisticadillac-
muzik, was an innovative, funk-
'n'-grits style hip-hop album that
made critics gush and produced
the top-20 hit "Players Ball."
Butwhile OutKast's firstalbum
was an unquestionable success,
the release ofATLiens,the group's
sophomore effort, defined when
OutKast really became OutKast.
Where Southernplaya focused on
more traditional hip-hop themes,
ATLiens saw the pair move away
from weed, women and pimping
to tackle subjects rarely heard
in hip hop at the time. There's
the honest-to-goodness love
song "Jazzy Belle," in which
Andre shows early signs of his
strong moral concern that would

later inform songs like The Love rhythms that would make top
Below's "Behold a Lady": "I hate jazz musicians blush. To hear
thinking that these the future Andre ease through the tongue-
mommas of our children / They cramping rhyme "While the rest
fuckin' a different nigga every of the countrybungies offbridges
time they get the feelin' to." without no snap back and bitches
There are also moments of they say they need that to shake

"Millennium": "I never lived up all in only two measures - is to

patience / Expect the worse but Then there's the production.
now I'm pacin'/ back and forth, For the second disc in a row,
inside." It's not an accident that OutKast chose to work with
a lot of the rhymes on the record Atlanta-based production squad
Organized Noize. Using gener-
ous doses of live instrumenta-
tion, the beats blend interstellar
'ATLiens' funk with laid-back Southern
soul. Never overwhelming, the
defined when music provided a comfortable,
groovy backdrop perfect for
OutKast became the duo's athletic verses to take
center stage - which is exactly
OutKast. where they belong.
ATLiens is pioneering, com-
pletely original and about as good
as a hip-hop album can get. It's
seem remarkably clear-headed - amazing, then, that it isn't even
Andre made the choice to give up OutKast's best record. Stanko-

On the title track, he spits "We improved on the few things Out-

It wasn't just that ATLiens was groups formed its identity, and
unlike anything in hip hop, nay, it was the first real step for one
music, in 1996. Innovation aside, of the most successful careers
the group's pure vocal skills were in modern music. Before "Rosa

BEETHOVEN
From Page 1B
and insights. Not only do the other instruments
make it possible to see Beethoven's progression in
terms of the piano sonata, but they also annotate
everything else that was going on in his head: cello
parts, brass quintet parts, etc. Keeping these differ-
ent instruments in mind affects how the students
hear their own piano performances as well.
"It gave me abetter understanding of what
Beethoven was thinking," Gaqi said.
Gaqi spoke with enthusiasm about his experience
playingseveral of the sonatas. Working with the
wind quartet in Opus 102 influenced his percep-
tion of the piano sonata, Opus 90, allowing him to
hear the possibility of the wind instruments even in

his solo performance. Cultivating an awareness of
Beethoven's musical context is vital for understand-
ing the "causation" Whiting hoped to uncover.
Similarly, Whiting expressed the benefit of listen-
ing to Schiff's interpretations.
"(Schiff's approach to music) is characterized by
a great deal of propriety, an incredible range of tone
colors and a minimum of histrionics and sustain-
ing pedal," he said. "He's not giving you mush, but
clarity. He's about to confront the foremost massive
ssonatas in the 32, and it's going to be a particular
pleasure to hear what a performer that's so associ-
ated with the music of J.S. Bach is going to do with
all the fugal material."
For Whiting and his students, the Beethoven
series may be just the beginning.
"I'd like to do something with Haydn's string
quartets," he said. "I'd love that."
