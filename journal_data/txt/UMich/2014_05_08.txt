Baseball tops Oakland

After 50 games, the Michigan
baseball team is finally on a roll.
Though months of inconsistent
play have prevented the Wolver-
ines from stringing wins together,
the Wolverines (11-10 Big Ten,
24-25-1 overall) have won four
straight and five of six. In a mid-
season addition to the schedule,
Michigan was able to continue
that positive momentum against a
familiar foe.
On Wednesday night, the Wol-
verines were able to overcome an
early deficit to beat Oakland for
the second time in nine days, this
"time by a score of 7-4.
"It was a good all-around team
win," said Michigan coach Erik
Bakich. "I'm proud of the way our
relief guys came in and pound-
ed the strike zone and gave our
offense a chance to get back in the
game, and our hitters were able to
string quality at-bats together, put
the ball in play and keep the pres-
sure on their defense."
Michigan came away with
another win, but not before a
_disastrous first inning shocked the
team. Normally the Sunday start-
er, senior left-hander Logan McA-
nallen got the start on the mound
to fine-tune things before facing
Ohio State this weekend. Instead,
he surrendered four hits and three
runs in the first frame to the Griz-
zlies (8-29) to put the Wolverines
in an early hole.
"(McAnallen) was making
some mistakes with his fastball
and leaving too much over the
plate," Bakich said. "Whether he
-was trying to throw away or go
in, he was catching too much of
the plate, and they were able to
put the barrel on it pretty consis-
tently."
Following the offensive spurt
by the Grizzlies, Michigan battled
back with its own bats, usingthree
extra-base hits and a number of
errant pitches by Oakland pitch-
ers to take a 4-3 lead in the second
inning.
On the defensive side, the Wol-
verines were able to limit the Oak-
land offense to just three hits and
one ninth-inning run the remain-
der of the game, allowing what
looked like an upset in the making
to become an easy win.
"(Freshman right-hander) Cam
Wysocki was critical to that,"
Bakich said. "He was able to pitch

Kevin White has started four games since starter Jacksos Lamb injured his back.
White, Jamett
earn starting roles

five shutout innings on 48 pitches,
which means he was able to work
very fast. He was pounding the
strike zone and giving us a chance
to get back in the game."
After several quiet innings from
both sides, Michigan was in the
midst of another rally in the sixth
inning - having already scored
one run with a runner on second
with no one out - when an incom-
ing thunderstorm delayed the
game for 68 minutes.
"We just talked to the team,"
Bakich said, "and told them to
make sure they go back out there
and compete with the same intent
and sense of urgency they had at
the beginning of the game, and not
let a rain delay lull you to sleep.
"I thought our guys did a nice
job tacking on runs right after the
delay and staying aggressive. That
was a big part of the game to come
out strong and not ease back into
it."
Following the storm, the Wol-
verines picked up rightwhere they
left off. Entering the delay in a 1-0
count, freshman outfielder Car-
men Benedetti drove a two-run
homer to right, extending Michi-
gan's lead to four.
The bomb was Benedetti's first
career home run, but the fresh-
man - who went 2-for-3 with four

RBI in the game - is hitting .359
with 20 RBI since April 1, num-
bers that have not only moved him
up in the depth chart and lineup,
but asserted Bendetti as one of the
team leaders.
"(Benedetti) didn't get a lot of
opportunities and wasn't a go-to
guy at the beginning of the year,"
Bakich said. "But he's become one
our mainstays in the middle of the
order and has been very consis-
tent. His development is just his
maturation as a collegiate hitter
and getting comfortable at this
level. The more he sees, the better
he's getting, and now you're start-
ing to see some power come with
that."
As a team, the Wolverines' team
average has risen to a season-
best .258. With a critical series
against Ohio State and the Big Ten
Tournament looming in the near
future, Bakich feels good about his
suddenly successful team.
"We just have to keep that
competitive mentality," Bakich
said. "That's where I've seen an
adjustment in the way these guys
approach the game, we're doing
a much better job of competing
every time we step into the box
and step on the mound. We just
want to keep that going as long as
we possibly can."

Juniors fill in for
injured starters
down the stretch
By BRAD WHIPPLE
Daily Sports Writer
With just 10 days left in the reg-
ular season, one would think inju-
ries to two starters would put the
Michigan baseball team at a disad-
vantage.
Not quite - just look at right
fielder Kevin White and designated
hitter Dominic Jamett.
The juniors had waited all sea-
son for the opportunity to get off
the bench and onto the field. Now
that they have one, they've been
makingthe most of it.
"Those guys have been work-
ing hard," said Michigan coach
Erik Bakich, "and they deserve a
chance."
Before the April 25 game against
Nebraska,junior firstbaseman Kyle
Jusick was taking batting practice
when he suffered an oblique strain
in his back, causing him to miss the
entire series.
A week later, in the series opener
against Northwestern, left fielder
Jackson Lamb tried to make a div-
ing catch on a line drive but instead
missed the ball and aggravated a
muscle in his back - the same mus-
cle that proved to be troublesome
for the freshman in the first few
weeks of the year.
White and Jamett filled the
two open spots in Saturday's game
against the Wildcats and have held
onto them, hitting safely in every
game since.

"Kevin hasn't played consistent-
ly and is a guy who has been wait-
ing patiently," said Bakich. "There
have been other outfielders ahead
of him, but he has stepped up and
said 'I'm the guy.' We've battled
consistency issues all year, so
maybe now it's his turn to see what
he can do over a consistent period."
Saturday was White's first start
since March 9 and Jamett's first
of the season. In the first inning,
Michigan (11-10 Big Ten, 24-25-1
overall) posted nine runs en route
to an 18-6 win. As part of the explo-
sive timing, the pair contributed
two singles. Later in the seventh
inning, White also bombed his first
home run of the season to left field.
The two juniors' ability to drive
in runs and contribute quality at-
bats put them back on the field to
start Michigan's last game in the
series against Northwestern and
Tuesday's game against Central
Michigan.
In the last three games, each of
them have driven in three runs,
with White going a combined 6-for-
12 and Jamett 6-for-13. White said
that over the last few months, he's
been improving by focusing on
what he can control while forget-
ting the elements beyond his grasp.
"Being somebody who hasn't
started in that long of a time period,
I'm always looking for ways to con-
tribute to the team," White said.
"Whether it's bringing positive
energy from the bench or whatever
I can."
Though it remains to be seen
if the duo can continue to put up
consistent numbers, Michigan
must hope the iron remains hot if it
wants the season to continue,

AAATA's

The .7 millage is
approved by 2-to-1
margin, will bring in
$4.4 million
By STEPHANIE SHENOUDA
ManagingEditor
With the results of Tues-
day's special election tallied, the
Ann Arbor Area Transportation
Authority's proposed transit mill-
age passed with 71 percent of vot-
ers supporting expanded transit
service.
Voters passed the millage in all
of the Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti pre-
cincts, and all but two precincts in
Ypsilanti Township. The final vote
count was 13,949 to 5,783.
The proposal, which was consid-
ered in a special election, involved
a .7 mill, which the AAATA would
reportedly use to provide the con-
tinuation of increased services
in those communities, including
more night and weekend routes,
increased services for the elderly
and disabled and more routes with-
in the city of Ypsilanti.
The referendum will cost
about $33 per year for residents
whose homes are valued at about
$100,000.
State Representative Jeff Irwin
(D-Ann Arbor) is a casual public
transit user and has supported the
millage since talks began almost
five years ago when it was evident
that the needs of the area were
changing. He said the $4.4 mil-
lion raised will be an "investment
in better quality service" for those
that enjoy or rely on the AAATA's
services.
Irwin added that through-
out its 30-year history, the

Proceedings allege
wrongdoing in
sexual misconduct
investigation
By STEPHANIE SHENOUDA
Managing Editor
Former student Drew Ster-
ret filed a lawsuit against the
University on April 23 after he
was suspended from school fol-
lowing allegations of sexual
misconduct. Sterrett, who was
a student in the College of Engi-

neering, has taken legal action
because he said he was denied
due process during the inves-
tigation, after a complaint was
filed against him by a female
friend whom he had sexual rela-
tions with.
Sterrett's attorney Debo-
rah Gordon told The Michigan
Daily she finds the University
was "completely neglectful"
in almost every aspect of
their internal investigation,
which ultimately left Sterrett
"deprived of his educational
opportunity."
Gordon added that the Uni-
versity's "sloppy" investigation

led to a false result and main-
tains her client's innocence
based on official affidavit state-
ments that Sterrett obtained
from witnesses in an attempt
to provide evidence to clear his
name.
She explained that with all
other crimes, from minor in
possession to public indecency
charges, the accused is allowed
a hearing and chance to speak
with witnesses as part of their
due process rights. These allow-
ances are not offered to those
accused of sexual assault, which
Gordon said she believes is the

Council considers
deer population
control, plans to halt
Uber operations
By MATT JACKONEN
Daily Staff Reporter
Monday night, city council
unanimously passed the first read
of a resolution that would disal-
low any inquiry into an applicant's
felony history on city of Ann Arbor
employment applications.
City staff would still be able to
run background checks, but this
resolution would limit such checks
only to applicants who have already
been considered in the first batch
of applications for any position and
have made the cut.
City Councilmember Sabra Bri-
ere (D-Ward 1) said the resolution,
which she is sponsoring, would
allow those with a criminal past to
get a fair shot at employment.
"This makes it possible to evalu-

ate applicants with no unacknowl-
edged bias toward the applicant
because at some point in the past
they had a felony conviction," Briere
said. "It's possible to look at their
work history, academic history,
experience, knowledge and ability
to the job and then consider them
for employment."
Councilmember Chuck Warpe-
hoski (D-Ward 4) also noted that
the felony check box on an applica-
tion is often a barrier for people who
would like to contribute to society
again.
"Having the box on an applica-
tion is a barrier to a lot of people that
have paid their debt to society and
are trying to get their lives back in
order," Warpehoski said.
Warpehoski added that many
applicants' criminal convictions
would not pose a threat in the work-
place.
"If somebody has a DUI, you prob-
ably don't want them driving a city
vehicle," Warpehoski said. "That's a
relevant issue, but not all are. This
gives us a more narrow tool."

Mackinac City
bicycle trek will
raise money for
cancer research
By ALLANA AKHTAR
Daily News Editor
Business sophomore Paige
Hackenberger is not one to back
down from a challenge.
After beating a battle with
cancer, she's now taking on the
challenge of leading a team of
44 cyclists on a 100-mile ride in
Mackinaw City, Mich. to raise
thousands of dollars for cancer
research.
Hackenberger is participating
in a Team in Training program
sponsored by the Leukemia and
Lymphoma Society. The pro-
grams involve endurance train-
ing and physical activity to raise
money for cancer research.
Though the bike ride on June
14 is Hackenberger's first TNT
event, she has been involved
with LLS since she was first
diagnosed with Hodgkin's lym-
phoma at nine years old.
When she was in the fourth
grade, Hackenberger went to the
doctor's office to have a peculiar
lump on her neck examined. She
later discovered she had a can-
taloupe-sized tumor growing in
her chest, moving her heart to
the center of her body and her
trachea to the side.
"I think my exact quote was,
'You're wrong. Cancer is only
something grandpas and grand-
mas get, and then they die,' "she
said.
Throughout her experience
with Hodgkin's lymphoma,
Hackenberger said the LLS
became a stalwart for her family
and friends.
The LLS is the world's larg-
est voluntary health agency
that supports patients and their
families suffering from blood

cancer and provides funding for
potentially life-saving research.
The agency was founded in New
York in 1949 and currently has
63 chapters nationwide. So far,
the organization has invested
over $1 billion in blood cancer
research.
While Hackenberger was
going through chemotherapy,
volunteers from the LLS con-
tacted her parents and informed
the family on what to expect
during treatment and in recov-
ery. She and her family came to
rely on the organization during
Hackenberger's treatment for
both information and support.
"I know (my parents) feel like
without this organization, my
experience would've been more
scary and a lot less guided," she
said.
After successfully concluding
treatment, Hackenberger imme-
diatelybecame involved with the
LLS. In high school she helped
organize fundraisers such as
Pennies for Patients, a program
where LLS representatives visit
elementary schools around the
state to educate students about
blood cancer. In turn, students
collected spare change to donate
to research.
Hackenberger said her
involvement with the LLS is a
way to express gratitude for the
volunteers who helped her and
her family as she struggled with
the disease. She said it was no
coincidence that she survived
Hodgkin's lymphoma and sees it
as her opportunity to give back
to others walking in the same
shoes.
"I just find it incredibly fulfill-
ing to be able to say that I'm here
today because of what people
have done in the past and that
I'm going to maybe give some-
one through my hard work and
the hard work of so many other
people, the opportunity to be
with their family for the rest of
their life," she said.

Your Move, Michigan:'Shocking' the Wolverines

Lyndsay Doyle stood in center
field with her shoulders slumped
and a nervous look for the first
time in weeks.
The senior had JAE
just muffed a LOURIM
base hit up the
middle, and On Softball
though she had
an outfielder on
both sides of her and a dozen more
teammates in the dugout, it must
have felt like she was all alone.
She cracked her knuckles and
got back into her stance to get
ready for the next pitch with last-
place Illinois in the middle of a 10-2
bashing.
The first two-thirds of Michi-
gan's season went like a boxing
match between a heavyweight and
a high schooler with no gloves. The
Wolverines dominated every oppo-
nent, knocking them out before
they even got into the ring.
That night, they got punched.
And now, two weeks later, it's their
turn to respond.
It's a fairly new predicament
for Michigan: Doyle hadn't had to
recover from an error because she
hadn't made an error. The pitchers
hadn't had to pitch in close games
because there hadn't been any

close games. No one had needed a
clutch seventh-inning hit because
they hadn't played many seventh
innings, instead winning by mercy
rule.
So much is hanging in the bal-
ance at this point in the season - so
much to gain, so much to lose.
The Wolverines are behind five
Pac-12 teams, three SEC teams and
Florida State in the coaches poll.
All of those teams have been tested
by tough competition for the past
two months.
In the past three weeks, Michi-
gan has gotten a couple punches
back and not known what to
do with them. The Wolverines
watched a dropped third strike
roll into the opposing dugout last
Friday. The pitchers threw balls in
the dirt for junior catcher Lauren
Sweet to dig up. The table setters
didn't set the table, and the power
hitters didn't hit.
"Bad time of the year to be hav-
ing bad softball," said Michigan
coach Carol Hutchins on Friday.
Yes, it is. But every time the Wol-
verines lose the first game of the
series, they fight back with a win
in the next game. It's clear the tal-
ent is there. If Michigan turns it
around this weekend, the Big Ten

Tournament could start to look like
the first half of the Big Ten season.
If it doesn't, the Wolverines might
be coming home Friday night.
So how do they punch back on a
more consistent basis?
Is it trying harder? No.
Sophomore shortstop Sierra
Romero said Friday that Michigan
was coming up empty offensively
because the hitters were trying too
hard. Romero deals with that more
than anyone - when opponents
pitch around her, she can't lunge at
the first pitch close to the zone.
Is it getting afraid? Not usually.
Hutchins said Friday her team
was too afraid of losing and too
consumed by outcomes. With the
pressure to win mounting, Michi-
gan struggled more and more.
"It was a hard practice (last
Thursday) because for some reason
we're not playing good softball right
now, not hustling," she said. "And
it's all of them. Not just a couple of
them, it's all of them. Fear paralyzes
you. It's so funny because when
you're afraid of losing, you don't
lose, you get killed. But yeah, we
played really afraid to lose. It's the
worst quality ateam can have."
Last Friday was something
new entirely. Hutchins said her

Carol Hutchins and Michigan are being tested for the first time in two months.

team would have to hit rock-bot-
tom to rebuild its mindset and
move forward, and Friday's 9-3
loss - punctuated by Wisconsin's
seventh-inning grand slam - was
pretty close.
So, to use Hutchins' words, she
"shocked" them. She lit into them
after the game about their flaws.
She lamented the team's poor lead-
ership, calling it "horrible." She
acknowledged the team's mindset
- "individuals don't win, this is not
track."
And to that the team respond-
ed with a 10-2 win the next day,
though Hutchins said she would

have been happy with any outcome
the way Michigan played.
"The only thing I care about
is our approach and mentality,"-
Hutchins said. "I don't care about
the game. I don't care about the
outcome. I want a team that fights
and plays hard. Watching balls roll
into the dugout and not picking
it up and throwing it to first, not
once, not twice, but three times,
using your glove to swat it to home
plate, I've never taught that play. I
want to see us play ball."
Playing ball is certain. The rest is
not - it all depends on how Michi-
gan responds.

The Michigan softball team has
dominated the Big Ten on the field
over the past seven years, winning
at least a share of the conference
title each year.
So it's no surprise that the Wol-
verines continue to rake in the
hardware as well.
The Big Ten announced its All-
Conference teams Wednesday,
including Michigan sophomore
shortstop Sierra Romero as Player
of the Year for the second straight
year. Romero was one ofseven Wol-
verines on the first or second team,
while senior outfielder Nicole Sap-
pingfield and freshman second
baseman Abby Ramirez made the
All-Defensive Team.
Despite seeing far fewer strikes
than last year, Romero contin-
ued her strong play throughout
the conference season to become
Michigan's sixth straight Player of
the Year and second straight back-
to-back winner. Michigan coach
Carol Hutchins said she improved

most on defense this year, showing
range at shortstop with a.930 field-
ingpercentage.
She also hit .511, tops in the Big
Ten by almost 100 points, with 15
home runs and 60 RBI. Her on-
base percentage (641) and slugging
percentage (.927) also ranked first.
Romero played in all 51 games
and started 50 in the No. 3 spot in
the order. Though opponents often
pitched around her to the tune of 52
walks, her protection from senior
first baseman Caitlin Blanchard,
sophomore outfielder Sierra Law-
rence and senior designated player
Taylor Hasselbach helped keep her
a force in the lineup.
Senior outfielders Lyndsay Doyle
- a unanimous selection - and
Sappingfield joined Romero on the
first team as Michigan's table set-
ters. The two slap-hitters hit .388
and .405, respectively, and together
started every game but one. Their
ability to reach base meant Romero
was often hitting with runners on.
The All-Big Ten second team
also featured four Wolverines -
Hasselbach, junior catcher Lauren

'M' dominates All-Big Ten teams

Sweet, junior left-hander Haylie
Wagner and freshman right-hand-
er Megan Betsa - which along
with the first team totaled almost
two-thirds of the team's regular
starters being honored.
Despite slumping late in the
year, Wagner finished 20-2 with
a 1.51 earned-run average. Until
the Minnesota series April 18, she
served as the team's ace and Friday
night starter. Going into that week-
end, she was 19-0 with a0.95 ERA.
Betsa, meanwhile, worked out
some issues early in the season and
became the most reliable starter
in the final two weekends. She fol-
lowed each of Michigan's last three
losses - besides the season finale -
with a win, finishing 7-0 with a L92
ERA in the Big Ten.
One of Michigan's greatest
strengths earlier in the season was
scoring in bunches, which it did
using a deep lineup top to bottom.
Whether that carries over to this
weekend's Big Ten Tournament in
Evanston remains to be seen, but
the Wolverines have shown they
have the talent to win it.

Reeling 'M'heads to BIG Tournament

For all of the success the Michi-
gan softball team has had this
season, its past three series open-
ers have been losses to unranked
teams by scores of 10-2, 3-2 and 9-3.
Another stinker like those on
Friday and the Wolverines will be
headed home early from the Big
Ten Tournament in Evanston.
Michigan (18-5 Big Ten, 40-11
overall) heads into this week-
end's tournament after its seventh
straight conference championship,
but the Wolverines have lost five of
their last 11 to fall into a tie for first
place.

Ironically, the sustained success
earlier in the season - including
a 20-game win streak - piled on
pressure that made Michigan tense
for the final three weekends of the
regular season.
"This is a team that is so afraid of
not winning," said Michigan coach
Carol Hutchins after last Friday's
loss to Wisconsin. "They're so
caught up in their outcomes, which
is not what we teach at Michigan.
We teach process, but they're not
buying in."
First, it was a two-hit shutout at
the hands of Minnesota. Then, a
four-error performance in a run-
rule loss to Illinois, which was in
last place at the time. Finally, a 9-3

blowout against Wisconsin last Fri-
day night.
There have been bright spots for
the Wolverines. Each time, they
responded, most recently with a
10-2 mercy-rule victory over Wis-
consin on Saturday. The next day,
with the outright Big Ten cham-
pionship on the line, Michigan
battled for more than three hours
with Wisconsin before falling in
nine innings, 6-5.
Despite the result Sunday,
Hutchins saw improvement in her
team in its final series of the regu-
lar season.
Regardless of the past three
weeks, the Wolverines have the
best player in the conference, soph-

omore shortstop Sierra Romero,
as evidenced by her Big Ten Play-
er of the Year award announced
Wednesday. It also has three of
the best pitchers in the conference,
including junior left-hander Haylie
Wagner, who has struggled with
a 1-2 record and 4.79 earned-run
average in her last six appearances
but still won the league ERA title.
As a team, Michigan ranks first
in runs scored, batting average,
ERA and fielding percentage.
If the Wolverines play the way
they played for most of the season,
hardly anyone else has a chance.
If they continue to make mistakes
and play down to their competi-
tion, the field is wide-open.
Here's a look at their chances in
each round.
QUARTERFINALS: Possible
opponents are No. 8 seed Iowa
(9-14, 16-29-1) or No. 9 seed Illinois
(7-16, 23-25).
The top seed's quarterfinal game
is traditionally lopsided, but that
was the expectation two weeks ago
when the Wolverines rolled into
Champaign. Instead, Illinois mer-
cied Michigan in the first game and
would have wonthe series if not for
a late error in the finale.
The Hawkeyes come in well
below the .500 mark but do boast
shortstop Megan Blank, a first-
team All-Big Ten and All-Defen-
sive Team honoree.
The Fighting Illini seem to be
peaking at the right time, led by
freshman pitcher Brandi Need-
ham's tidy 2.94 ERA. Illinois also
has four hitters who hit above .300
and can get on a roll - just as they
did in the series opener against
Michigan.
This season, that 10-2 loss to Illi-
nois has been the exception rather
than the rule for Michigan. The
Wolverines should coast, barring a
collapse.
SEMIFINALS: Possible oppo-
nents are No. 12 seed Michigan
State (4-19, 12-36), No. 5 seed
Northwestern (14-9, 32-15) and No.
4 seed Wisconsin (15-7, 33-17).
The Wildcats should take care
of*Michigan State easily on their
home field Thursday, setting up
a quarterfinal matchup Friday
against Wisconsin, which could go
either way.
The Wolverines have not yet
seen Northwestern, which has
posed an issue in the past. The
Wildcats rank just behind Michi-
gan in batting average (.334) and
fielding percentage (.970) and first

in on-base percentage. However,
their pitching lags a bit behind
with a 3.75 ERA.
At Northwestern's small, hit-
ter-friendly Sharon J. Drysdale
Field, the Wolverines might have a
chance to go deep.
As they showed last weekend, the
Badgers can pose just as much of an
issue. They have two capable pitch-
ers who each beat Michigan once
last weekend, and they lead the Big
Ten by far with 107 stolen bases.
Wisconsin's contact hitting and
crafty base running allow the Bad-
gers to hang around in games. Last
weekend, they clung to a 4-2 lead
on Friday before breaking out with
a five-run seventh. Sunday, they
matched Michigan run for run
before pulling through with a solo
shot in the ninth.
FINAL: Itcouldbe anyone of six
teams, but the likely opponents are
No.2 seed Nebraska (18-5,40-14) or
No. 3 seed Minnesota (16-6, 38-9).
For NCAA Tournament pur-
poses, the Wolverines should hope
for Nebraska or Minnesota. For
the most part, the top 16 in the RPI
host regionals, and Michigan is on
the outside looking in at No. 18. A
win over the 17th-ranked Gophers
or 19th-ranked Cornhuskers might
push them over the edge.
But neither of those would come
easily. The Wolverines have not
played Nebraska, but they would
run up against some firepower.
The power-hitting Cornhusk-
ers rank right behind Michigan in
runs and lead the league in doubles
and home runs, and have the best
chance of testing the Wolverines'
top-ranked pitching staff. On the
other side, Nebraska has a 1-2
pitching punch of Tatum Edwards
and Emily Lockman, who have
twin 1.94 ERAs.
Michigan took two of three
from Minnesota three weeks ago
at Alumni Field. The key for the
Gophers is pitching. Big Ten Pitch-
er of the Year Sara Groenewegen
finished 12-2 with a 2.27 ERA, and
Sara Moulton was at times even
better, going24-6 with a 1.69 ERA.
A loss early in the tournament -
or even to a lesser opponent in the
final - could send the Wolverines
tumbling further in the tourna-
ment. But a championship could
bring them back to where they
were during March.
The former could mean a short
postseason for Michigan. A cham-
pionship might mean it's just get-
ting started.

Kunselman unveils plans to halt
Uber operations
Councilmember Stephen Kun-
selman (D-Ward 3) unveiled a plan
to propose a resolution - should it
be necessary - to stop the opera-
tions of the popular new startup
Uber.
Uber allows people to find driv-
ers in their respective areas via a
mobile application. Though Uber
does require its drivers to get a
background check according to
state law, because drivers use their
private cars and do not use taxis or
limos registered by the state or city
governments, opponents argue the
application creates potential safety
hazards.
Kunselman noted that a large
part of his problem with Uber lies
in its lack of attention to issues of
public safety such as providing
proof of insurance as a driver for
hire.
"For the life of me, I do not
understand how a for-profit busi-
ness believes that public safety is in
their interest when they're just out
to make a dollar," he said.

AAATA millage will help increase access to transportation
n Tuesday, Ann Arbor, Ypsilanti and Ypsilanti Township
passed a 0.7-mill tax increase to expand transit services. The
mileage passed with a 71 percent majority in Ann Arbor, 83
percent in Ypsilanti and 62 percent in Ypsilanti Township in favor of
the Ann Arbor Area Transit Authority's proposal. Expanded servic-
es are expected to begin in August just as the fall semester begins for
students. Major renovations to the AAATA will be phased out over
several years in order to help with a smooth transition. Passing the
millage was a commendable move that will increase transportation
for those who most need it. However, the AAATA must ensure that
the millage funds improve transit services in a way that will posi-
tively impact citizens and ease transportation for the entire county.

When NBA Commissioner
Adam Silver handed Los
Angeles Clippers owner

a lifetime ban
and $2.5 million
fine for his racist
remarks during a
private conversa-
tion, it was obvious
to me he did the
right thing. DEREK
Regardless of WOLFE
the origin of the
recording, Sterling
was further exposed as the racist he
truly is. The key word here is "further."
As many other articles have already
said, it's unfortunate itgottothis point
in the first place to punish Sterling. He
has a long history of prejudiced views
that he implemented into his business.
Both in 2003 and 2006, he was sued
for housing discrimination in a case in
which he essentially tried to prevent
African-Americans from renting out
his properties. By all accounts, that is
far worse and has a much more dev-
astating impact than his most recent
comments. But in the end, Sterling
ultimately got what was coming to
him, and it appears he will eventually
be stripped of his ownership of the
team. Justice is served. Finally.
The same cannot be said about for-
mer NBA superstar Shaquille O'Neal
whose own shameful act was over-
shadowed by the Sterling coverage.
Earlier this week, Shaq posted a dis-
gusting photo on his Instagram of him
contorting his face mocking 23-year-
old Jahmel Binion of Detroit.
Binion has a rare condition called
ectodermal dysplasia. It results in
missing teeth and hair and also an
inability to sweat. While it's certain-
ly possible that Shaq did not realize
Binion had a condition, I really don't
care. Especially in a week that empha-
sized being careful in how you think,
what you say and what you do, Shaq's
actions were idiotic and insensitive.
And let's not forget Shaq also has an
MBA and Ed. D. Inexcusable.
As of now, it appears that all Shaq
has done is apologize. On his Twit-
ter, he wrote, "Made a new friend
today when I called and apologized
to Jahmel Binion. Great dude." Bin-
ion appreciated the phone call but
was still clearly upset when he was
interviewed: "I was thinking 'Man,
he's supposed to be this role model,

someone everyone is supposed to look
up to. If Shaq does something like
this, [everyone] will think, 'We should
do this."'
Binion hit the nail on the head. Shaq
is a public figure and must act like one.
But more importantly, he's a human
who should show compassion for oth-
ers. We should expect better from
him. And we should also expect more
from the NBA.
Shaq targeted another person. That
is bullying, intentional or not, and is

almost as equally atrocious as Ster-
ling's racist comments. If Adam Silver
doesn't punish him, then what exactly
was the point of making an example
out of Sterling? He created a new prec-
edent that if your actions do not fall
in the line with the NBA's brand, you
should be punished. Silver must abide
by his own standards.
But so should we. Large TV media
sources, such as CNN, Fox News,
MSNBC and ESPN, have proven since
the dawn of news that they will only
cover the most controversial and
interesting stories. What made the
Sterling story so interesting was that
players were threatening to boycott.
Players are most definitely not going
to boycott over a picture Shaq, an NBA
icon, put up on his Instagram. No way.
So that leaves it up to us. We have to
relentlessly educate each other about
what is right and wrong at all times
because there is no summer vacation
from life. If the citizens of the United
States are truly serious about removing
the hateful, prejudiced behavior that
stains our society, then every moment
has to become a teaching moment. If
something is racist on Monday, then it
also has to be racist on Friday.
Consistency is key.
I want to live in a world without so
much hatred. While that's certainly
a tall order, learning to think twice
before we say - or post - something
is a good place to start.

The definitive

the difficulty of puhlishing
writing during
the Second World
War. A similar dilemma confronts
any biographer, whose challenge
is in synthesizing the accomplish-
ments and minutiae of a life with a
broader historical scope.
Even more difficult is to write
a biography of a person like Ber-
tolt Brecht - poet, playwright, and
theater director by trade - whose
body of work is centrally concerned
with the relationship between his-
tory and the creation of art. Stephen
Parker powerfully evokes Brecht's
life within a set of historical circum-
stances, withoutsacrificingthe com-
plexity ofone to the other, in "Bertolt
Brecht: A Literary Life."
Brecht set out to embody this
historical perspective in his drama-
turgical practice called Epic The-
ater, which sought to represent and
analyze the "historical causalities,"
in Parker's words, of the action on
stage. Brecht actively discouraged
the passive identification that char-
acterizedbothbourgeoistheaterand
the school of acting of Constantin
Stanislavski, the father of "method
acting" and a household name today.
Following the destruction of the
First World War and the failed Ger-
man Revolution of 1918-19, Brecht's
aesthetic practice would be tied
permanently to his desire for soci-
etal emancipation and his vision of a
socialist society, primarily exempli-
fied by the Soviet Union during his

life. His relationship to the USSR, up her arms like an C

of Brecht's that informed his writ- cianship strengthen
ing, beit his lifelonginability to tem-
per his sexual appetite or manage
his frail body. In particular, Parker
emphasizes the latter in the way that
Brecht's writings, even at his most
Leninist moments, revolve around aP "
feeling of bodily precarity and appe-
tite-driven excess.
Parker's success is the caution
and deliberateness with which
he traces Brecht's multifaceted,
contradictory personality and
artistic corpus. Brecht drew inspi-
ration from Taoism and Marxism
alike. This heterodoxy, though not
endearing him to the cultural guard
in Moscow, sets Brecht apart as a
radical innovator of the theatrical
arts without reducing his political
committment and creativity to a
stale Marxist orthodoxy.
As Parker points out several
times, the intensity and lack of for-
giveness in the aesthetic debates of
the era seem alien to readers today.
The world has changed signifi-
cantly since Brecht's lifetime, not
least of all with the entrenchment
of global capitalism and its austerity
program, and this variety of politi-
cal art can seem bewildering to the
world of the corporate Masters of
Fine Art workshop. Parker succeeds
remarkably in animating the world
of political instability and terror
that Brecht lived through, where
the failure of the Left to coalesce
enabled the rise of Fascism.
"The Left once had a political
strategy: it was called revolution,"
said Fredric Jameson, an American
Marxistliterary critic and professor
of literature at Duke University, ina
recent talk at the City University of
New York. For readers of Parker's
biography, Brecht's life and artistic
output are instructive for the artist
who seeks to create politically pro-
vocative and relevant art.

The millage is expected to
increase bus hours on nights
and weekends, help purchase
more buses with better fuel
efficiency, improve bus stops,
redesign routes and expand
dial-a-ride services. The
AAATA intends to hire 60 addi-
tional bus drivers increasing
job opportunities for surround-
ing residents. Furthermore,
AAATA is seeking to expand
transit into other areas includ-
ing Saline, Pittsfield and Scio
Road Townships in order to
create a more comprehensive
transit service.
The expansion of transpor-

tation services provides numer-
ous benefits. Increasing The
Ride's frequency will motivate
students to use public transit,
providing an opportunity to
take better advantage of off-
campus resources. With stu-
dents' busy schedules, waiting
for a bus to go grocery shopping
can be inconvenient. There-
fore, increasing frequencies
of busses helps to reduce time
waiting at bus stops. Expand-
ing bus routes and hours will
also decrease car usage, pro-
viding a positive externality for
the environment.
Improved public transit

will help connect the Ypsilanti
and Ann Arbor areas, provid-
ing economic benefits to both
communities. The proposal
includes a new route that will
be added to Ypsilanti this year,
and 2016 will mark major rede-
signs of current Ypsilanti and
western Ann Arbor routes.
Given Ypsilanti's higher popu-
lation of lower socioeconomic
citizens, public transportation
is vital in allowing access to
Ann Arbor where many citi-
zens work at a lower cost. These
methods of inter-connection
will enhance the lives of many
residents in the area.

Considering the creative and
emotional investment this show
requires, it shouldn't be surpris-
ing that, at the end of his third

that he needed to take a break. 19

gotten older, and so has the show.
In a sly callout to his hiatus, the

fourth season. There's a long
discussion about masturbation
around a poker table with some
comedian friends, a conversa-
tion with a doctor who explains
that back pain is inevitable
until human vertebrae evolve to
accommodate for gravity and,
more seriously, Louie address-
es aging and death. But unlike
other prominent New York-based
comedians/auteurs, Louie doesn't
obsess over death; he treats it in
a nonchalant, off-the-cuff way.
When his daughter has to write a
letter to AIDS for a school assign-
ment, he pitches the opening,
"Dear AIDS, please cut it out?" In
a stand-up bit that FX has been

He also ruminates on women
and dating. In the season's sec-
ond episode, "Model," Louie
bombs at a stand-up gig but
ends up hitting it off with a
beautiful, young, blonde model
(Yvonne Strahovski, "Chuck").
He's invited back to the billion-
aire daughter-of-an-astronaut's
home, where he makes her laugh
and they promptly sleep together.
But in typical "Louie" fashion,
this absurdity is matched with
more absurdity. She tickles him
in attempt to make him laugh,
Louie reacts violently to tick-
ling, he ends up knocking her
out cold and hospitalizing her,
only to finish the episode with
a lawsuit from her family and a
payment of $5,000 a month in
damages for the rest of his life.

A more in-depth and truly inter-
esting reflection plays out in the
season's third episode, titled "So
Did The Fat Lady." C.K. calls out
a societal contradiction in a blunt
and thoughtful way, with help
from the hilarious Sarah Baker,
who plays the episode's "fat lady,"
Vanessa. When she badgers (in
a likeable way, I swear) Louie to
go out on a date with her and he
eventually agrees, Louie makes a
stupid comment and provokes a
rant from Sarah thr.t spouts more
truth than any othe: half hour of
television I've ever seen. In an
inspired move, C.K. allows the
episode to bask in the discussion
of the contradictions and expec-
tations of female body image and
self-esteem rather than cutting it
short to get to the "funny."
"Louie" is good because it's
a vehicle through which Louis
C.K. can inject his unique brand
of humor into almost-neurotic
musings on human nature that
anyone can connect to. "Louie"
is great because Louis C.K. is not
afraid to push boundaries and
experiment with his work. Fin-
gerprints of his personal style
cover every aspect of every epi-
sode of his show: there's no one
to blame but himself when an epi-
sode misfires. Luckily, the show
consistently hits its mark. That's
what happens when you let a
proven creative genius like C.K.
have free reign over the content
he produces: you get "Louie," a
beautiful, nuanced, emotional,
hilarious game-changing show
that has forever changed the tele-
vision landscape, for the better.

By PAIGE PFLEGER
Daily Arts Writer
I've lived in Ann Arbor for about
three years now, but this past week-
end was the first time I had visited
the Ark - a fact that I'm told is a
crime, atravesty. I mean, I like music
just as much as the next gal; in fact
I've spent most of my life behind a
marimba or singing on a stage as a
marching band and choir geek dur-
ing high school (a personality I've
since stuffed frantically into a box in
the back of my closet since I came to
college). And I go to concerts occa-
sionally, but I'm a bit poor because
college costs too much money and so
does rent in A2. After scoring a free
ticket to the FolkFest from a friend, I
fell in love with the indie-alt musical
trio, Pearl and the Beard. So going
to their show at the Ark, located on
Main Street, seemed like a no-brain-
er, especially with a press pass. Note:
I would have paid money for the
show, but who says noto free things?
The Ark was nothing like I
expected. Igrabbed my ticket down-
stairs and followed a steady stream
of people up the stairs and into the
performance space - a huge half-
oval room with a stage in the middle
and rows of chairs fanning out from
the middle. The place was already
packed, and people were scurrying
about frantically to find any open
seats. It almost felt like a church, but
if church was more popular among
hipsters and lesbians and a hell of
a lot more relaxed. By the time the
opener started it was clear that they
had over sold the venue, and people
lined up in the hallways and leaned
against walls while the local Little
Island Lakes crooned and harmo-
nized. Lead singer Bobby Voorheis
has a sound reminiscent of Sufjan
Stevens and sings like it takes no
effort. I can barely even tell that his
mouth is moving.
When Pearl and the Beard took
the stage, most people had settled
into chairs that The Ark volunteers
had scrambled to set up. The band
started with hits off their newest
album, Killing the Darlings, such as
"The Lament of Coronado Brown,"
with a straight transition into
"Sweetness."
"The LamentofCoronado Brown"
was absolutely stunning, and the

room went silent when Emily Hope
Price began plucking the strings of
hercello. Sheheld itclosetoherbody
and leaned her head towards it like
she was embracing a dancing part-
ner. "They don't know," she began
quietly, "that I love you." Jocelyn
Mackenzie joined in on percussion,
and Jeremy Styles on guitar. When
the three harmonize their voices are
indistinguishable and chill inducing.
After"The Lament"the bandsped
it up again with its hit "Sweetness."
They got the audience clapping, and
by the halfway point of the song the
person working the bar in the back
room is jumping up and down, danc-
ing wildly and clapping her hands.
Unique and
crowd-pleasing
folk music from
young band
The rest of the audience was equally
enthralled, bobbing heads in their
seats, clapping and mouthing along
with the words. Mackenzie's drum-
beats were catchy, Price's cello play-
ing mesmerizing, and Styles' vocals
loud and strong. Put together, their
songs are amazing works of musi-
cianship and multitasking.
"We're so happy to be back at the
Ark!" Mackenzie says to a cheering
crowd.
One of my favorite things about
concerts is listeningtothe stageban-
ter of the performers, and Pearl and
the Beard have witty banter down to
an art.
"I feel like a gymnast, you know,
mounting an apparatus," Price says,
holding her arms up and then pull-
ing her cello towards herself. The
rest of the band giggles at this, and
talks about its trip to the Great Lakes
Rabbit Sanctuary.
Styles realizes he has been swear-
ing and asks the audience, "Are
there children here?" The audience
laughs, and Styles follows up with
"Do you know cuss words?"
They babble more about the rab-

During the 2007 football season
opener, the top-10 ranked Wolver-
ines were handed a humiliating
defeat at the hands of Appalachian
State University. With one of the
worst openers in Michigan history,
it looked like the season was lost.
A few months later and off the
gridiron, the Michigan Student
Assembly - later renamed Cen-
tral Student Government - passed
a student government resolu-
tion calling on the University to
revamp investments in renewable
energy. Citing an unacceptably low
percentage of electricity gener-
ated from renewable sources (wind,
solar, geothermal) for campus - 0.3
percent at the time - the resolution
called for Ann Arbor's campus to be
powered by 100 percent renewable
energy by 2015. Now just a year shy
of that 2015 deadline, how does the
University fare when it comes to
renewable energy?
Somewhere between three and
four percent of campus' energy
needs are met by renewable energy
today, according to the Office of
Campus Sustainability.
With the release of the latest
Intergovernmental Panel on Cli-
mate Change report in late March,
the United Nations warns that in
order to stave off the worst effects
of climate change we must double
investments in clean energy. If the
University didn't heed the call of a
student government resolution in
2007 will they at least recognize a
message from the United Nations
and the world's leading scientists?
One of the greatest things about
the University of Michigan is that
we are always in a position to make
a difference. We are role mod-
els, the leaders and best. When
Michigan speaks, others listen. So
we must speak, and we must do it
loudly. Within our relatively secure
community, it can often be diffi-
cult to see the effects of fossil fuels,
but look with a wider perspective
and they are staggering. Look at
Detroit, where communities are
exposed daily to the air and water
pollution from coal and oil refiner-
ies. Look at the Great Lakes, where
plummeting water levels and spik-
ing water temperatures threaten
the economy, water security and
ecology of the region. On a more
national scale, look at the recent

drought in California, the worst
in its recorded history. And these
pale in comparison to the climate-
induced impacts on many of the
poorest and most vulnerable coun-
tries around the world.
That's why our organization
- Students for Clean Energy -
decided to act. We launched our
"Greener Than Sparty" campaign
in March and rolled out with a UPe-
tition that has since surpassed 700
signatures. Through countless con-
versations with fellow students, we
have yet to experience any trepida-
tion to support the cause. The cam-
paign continues to grow in both
student involvement and in making
our presence felt by the administra-
tion, and we have no intentions of
slowing down.
The technology is out there, it's
up to us to take advantage of it and
then improve upon it. We should
expect our University to be inno-
vative when it comes to sourcing
clean, renewable energy on cam-
pus. Take the Ohio State University
for example. OSU has committed
to a stake in wind farm develop-
ment that powers approximately
23 percent of their electricity and
will now annually save nearly $1
million. When will Michigan fol-
low suit? Are we so content to bow
down to the school down south?
As the inspiration for our cam-
paign name, Greener Than Sparty,
Michigan State is on track to power
15 percent of their campus' energy
needs from renewable sources. Our
campaign calls for the University to
either match or exceed the renew-
able energy goals of MSU by 2015.
Remember that 2007 team that
lost to Appalachian State? Well
they turned the season around,
going 9-4 and winning the Capi-
tal One Bowl. Like them, we can
turn around our attitude toward
clean energy. We envision some
poetic justice in this story - Appa-
lachian State is Michigan's season
opener this fall. Just as they will
seek redemption for their previous
defeat, so too can the University for
past failure to invest in clean ener-
gy. It's time to recognize that when
it comes to energy, there's no better
way to be Blue than to go green.

this sum-
mer, to experience the other
big East Coast option for me
post-graduation. As someone
interested in a career in policy
work and advocacy for minority
rights, it was clear it was time
to pursue the revered Capitol
Hill internship.
I decided to apply for an
internship placement program,
SikhLEAD, which is part of a
Sikh advocacy and education
organization, Sikh American
Legal Defense and Education
Fund. After being selected for
SikhLEAD, the process began. I
had to work with the placement
organizer to focus my interests,
determine what would be a good
fit for me and start the applica-
tions for congressional offices.
The process was lengthy and
tiresome, often requiring imme-
diate responses or an application
filled out within 24 hours, send-
ing me on a complete rollercoast-
er of emotions.
After getting interviews for a
few congressional offices, I real-
ized that the process would take
a little more than I expected. A
lot of more competitive offices
were splitting their summer
internships into two sessions,
in order to allow twice as many
people the opportunityto partic-
ipate in the program. Although
this is certainly a great gesture

on their part, it made the process
more difficult personally. I now
needed to get selected for two
internships, not one, and I also
had to ensure that I received one
for the first half of the summer
and another for the second half
of the summer.
On top of school and the cum-
bersome internship hunt, there's
funding. Learning the hard way
from my ridiculously expensive
summer in Manhattan (hous-
ing alone was close to $4,000
for 11 weeks), I knew I needed
to look for funding sources early
on. Unfortunately, unlike many
of my peers, none of the aca-
demic departments I belong to
would provide funding for an
internship on Capitol Hill. I kept
searching and found the LSA
Internship Scholarship, to which
I ended up applying. But I know
that my summer will cost at least
a few thousand dollars, soI made
a visit to The Career Center with
the expectation that they could
help me locate more funding.
Unfortunately, I was disap-
pointed. The Career Center
representative I met with told
me that beyond the LSA Intern-
ship Scholarship, the University
doesn't have much funding to
support students over the sum-
mer, and there are little to no
local or national scholarships. If
I wanted to find other funding, I
would have to do it on my own.
Frustrated and disheartened, I
walked out of the office. Luckily,
I did receive the scholarship, but
without it, there's a good chance
I wouldn't be going to D.C. for
the summer.
Knowing that there are so
many factors that could have
prevented me from having a suc-
cessful internship experience
is not only disheartening, but
it makes me wonder about the
ways that these experiences are
created for a very select group

of people. Without the funding,
programs and networks I have,
it's likely that I wouldn't have
been able to make this summer
work for me.
Unpaid internships target a
very specific group of people
and leave many others out. By
capitalizing on students who
have the socioeconomic status
to pursue these internships,
these opportunities are cater-
ing success to those who are able
to afford it. When I decided my
career path, the advice rolled in:
The road to D.C.
has certainly
been a long one.
you need a law degree, a Capitol
Hill internship on your resume
is pretty much a prerequisite,
make sure you do a lot of net-
working. It doesn't take a rocket
science to see that all of these
"necessities" for success cost
money - a lot of money.
The road to D.C. has certainly
been a long one, and I'm sure my
internships will require just as
much energy, if not more. I'm
leaving Ann Arbor with excite-
ment and anticipation for the
experiences to come, but also
remembering that I'm one of the
lucky few who can take advan-
tage of experiences like this.
Although our social identities
certainly have an impact on our
daily lives, I hope that one day
they won't have such a power-
ful influence on what individu-
als are and are not able to do. If
we're all truly created equal, it's
certainly time that our institu-
tions reflect that truth

emphasized that no one from the
University ever met Sterrett in
person, which she viewed as one
of the many faults of the investi-
gation.
According to the details of the
lawsuit, Sterrett and the female
friend who eventually filed the
complaint went out "socializing"
and had sexual relations in his
dorm room, where she stayed the
entire night. She filed the com-
plaint with the University about
five months later but never con-
tacted the police. Sterrett was
told if he postponed the interview
to consult a lawyer, the investiga-
tion would continue without him
- which Gordon also cited as an
infringement of legal rights.
Gordon added that the pro-
ceedings will be a long road, and
that the next step is the "dis-
covery phase," where she will
perform depositions on the Uni-
versity officials involved in Ster-
rett's case. She anticipates it will
be many months before a court
date is set.
Sterrett is currently unable to
attend the University unless he
admits to committing the sexual
assault, a confession that Gordon
said is just "not possible" to make.
She added that he's had difficulty
finding employment or gaining
admission at other schools orce
institutions learn of the allega-
tions against him.
"My heart really goes out to
Drew because the University's
reckless actions really turned his
life around in an instant," Gor-
don said. "He came to (the Uni-
versity) expecting to go to this
great school and have all of these
great opportunities, and now this
unfortunate event will define his
college experience."
Under the University's recently
adopted sexual misconduct poli-
cy, officials need only preponder-
ance of evidence to find alleged
assailants responsible for sexual
misconduct. That policy was
enacted after the U.S. Depart-
ment of Education recommended
institutions amend their policies
to adopt a lower standard of evi-
dence in cases of sexual miscon-
duct.
Earlier this year, federal offi-
cials launched an investigation of
the University's handling of sex-
ual misconduct allegations after
receiving a complaints related to
the permanent separation of for-
mer kicker Brendan Gibbons. In
January, the Daily reported Gib-
bons had been permanently sepa-
rated from the University after
being found responsible for com-
mitting sexual misconduct.

Ceremony prepares for launch of University's
innovative Mobility Transformation Center

New facility will
allow researchers
to experiment with
automated vehicles
By IAN DILLINGHAM
Editor in Chief
Every year in the United States,
more than 30,000 people are killed
in motor vehicle accidents. In an
effort to cut that number, the Uni-
versity is laying the groundwork
to research systems that could
remove one of the most danger-
ous components from the modern
automobile - the driver.
In a small ceremony outside the
North Campus Research Complex
Tuesday, University administra-
tors and executives from vari-
ous fields met for the ceremonial
groundbreaking ofthe University's
Mobility Transformation Center,
which was conceived to move the
University forward in researching
connected and automated vehicle
technology.
The facility, which is being con-
structed at a cost of $6.5 million,
received support from public agen-
cies - most notably the Michigan
Department of Transportation -
and a private "leadership circle,"

which includes Robert Bosch LLC,
Econolite Group Inc., Ford Motor
Co., General Motors Co., Toyota
Motor Corp. and Xerox Corp.
Representatives from the orga-
nizations met for the first time at
Tuesday's event.
Peter Sweatman, director of
the MTC and UMTRI, said the
new complex is "not your grand-
mother's test track." The center
will feature "a simulation of dense,
complex, urban vehicle operation,"
including a variety of stoplights
and signals, as well as simulated
pedestrians, buses and other vehi-
cles.
"MTC is about cutting edge
research, but this great Univer-
sity is taking on a bigger task -
to accelerate the employment of
great technologies and creating
great facilities," Sweatman said.
Construction on the 32-acre
facility, which will be located
just off Plymouth Road, is slated
to begin in June with estimated
completion in September. If all
goes according to plan, Sweatman
said the track could be operational
in time for the Intelligent Trans-
portation Society of America 2014
World Congress in Detroit, a con-
vention that will showcase the lat-
est high-tech innovations within
the auto industry.
Collaboration between public

and private entities played a key
role in the center's establishment,
as the University looks for new
ways to bridge the gap between
basic research and commercial
applications.
S. Jack Hu, interim vice presi-
dent for research, said he has made
"public-private partnerships" a
major focus of his tenure.
"Not only can we do research,
but we can also translate research
into commercial and societal
impacts," Hu said.
Through the University's cur-
rently established Transporta-
tion Research Institute, UMTRI,
researchers have been exploring
connected vehicle technology as a
way to promote driver safety and
fuel efficiency. The institute is con-
ducting a large-scale pilot study of
such systems in Ann Arbor.
While MTC will focus primar-
ily on autonomous vehicles, Engi-
neering Dean David Munson said
the two disciplines - connected
systems and autonomous function
- are intertwined in their goal
of promoting driver safety. The
result, he said, could be a future
where it is "almost impossible to
crash your car".
Munson added that the Univer-
sity has established a niche nation-
ally as a leader in driver safety
research. While several other uni-

RUBY WALLAU/Daily
Interim Vice President for Research Jack Hu, Dean of the College of Technology
Dave Munson, Michigan Department of Transportation representative Greg John-
son, and the Director of Mobility Transformation Center Peter Sweatman participate
in a ceremonial ground breaking for the Michigan Mobility Transformation Center at
the Michigan North Campus Research Complex Tuesday,

versities around the nation have
established similar transporta-
tion institutes, he said they tend to
gravitate toward civil engineering
tasks, such as roadway construc-
tion, rather than on the driver.
"We're at the beginning of what
might be termed the most exciting
moment in history in the automo-
tive industry," Munson said.
However, he added the tech-
nology will not be implemented
overnight. In addition to research,

there are a great number of indus-
try adjustments and policy deci-
sions that must be addressed
before the cars of the future can
hit public roads.
"There are going to be a lot of
issues that are not just technologi-
cal issues," Munson said. "And we
have to figure it out, because we
can make it a better world if we
figure it out."

militants who have triggered inter-
national outrage over the kidnap-
ping of more than 270 Nigerian
schoolgirls opened fire on a busy
marketplace, killing hundreds of
people in a new spasm of violence in
the country's northeast.
The attack escalates Nigeria's
growing crisis from a campaign of
bombings, massacres and abduc-
tions being waged by the Boko
Haram terrorist network in its cam-

paign to impose an Islamic state on
Africa's most populous nation.
As many as 300 people were
killed in the assault late Monday
on the town of Gamboru Ngala on
Nigeria's border with Cameroon.
The extremists opened fire on a
marketplace bustling with shop-
pers taking advantage of the cool-
er nighttime temperatures in the
semi-desert region, then rampaged
through the town for 12 hours, set-
ting houses ablaze and shooting
those who tried to escape.
The attack and hundreds of casu-
alties were confirmed by Borno
state information commissioner
Mohammed Bulama, who spoke to
The Associated Press by telephone
Wednesday.
Nigerian federal Senator Ahmed

Zannah blamed fighters of the
Boko Haram terrorist network that
has claimed responsibility for the
April 15 kidnapping of 276 teenage
girls from their boarding school
in Chibok, in northeastern Borno
state. The insurgents threatened to
sell the young women into slavery in
avideo seen by AP.
Outrage over the missing girls
and the government's failure to
rescue them brought angry Nige-
rian protesters into the streets this
week in an embarrassment for the
government of President Goodluck
Jonathan, who had hoped to show-
case the country's emergence as
Africa's largest economy as it host-
ed the Africa meeting of the World
Economic Forum, the continent's
version of Davos.

Offers of international assistance
have poured in, with the Obama
administration announcing Tues-
day it was sending personnel and
equipmentto help Nigerian security
forces in their search for the girls in
the vast Sambisa Forest. Jonathan
confirmed that he has accepted the
American assistance, which the
Pentagon said Wednesday will help
with communications, logistics and
intelligence planning, but will not
include any military operations.
Britain and China announced
Wednesday that Nigeria has accept-
ed their offers of help, and France
said it was sending in a "specialized
team" to help with search and res-
cue of the girls.
"In the face of such an appalling
act, France, like other democratic

nations, must react," French Foreign
Minister Laurent Fabius said. "This
crime will notgo unpunished."
Fabius gave no details, except to
say the team was being drawn from
forces already in the region. France
has soldiers in Niger, Cameroon and
Mali, where it is fighting Islamic
insurgents, as well as in Central
African Republic.
The kidnapping has ignited a
viral social media campaign under
the hashtag #BringBackOurGirls
that has brought renewed atten-
tion to Boko Haram's campaign of
violence. On Wednesday, first lady
Michelle Obama joined in, tweet-
ing, "Our prayers are with the
missing Nigerian girls and their
families. It's time to #BringBack-
OurGirls."
