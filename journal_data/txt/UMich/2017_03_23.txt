With just hours remaining 

before polls opened for the 
2017-18 
Central 
Student 

Government 
elections 

Tuesday 
evening, 
Public 

Policy junior Nadine Jawad, 
the eMerge vice-presidential 
candidate 
who 
currently 

serves 
as 
an 
executive 

policy adviser, made a final 
proposal 
to 
the 
current 

assembly. Jawad introduced 
a 
resolution 
encouraging 

University 
of 
Michigan 

Housing to integrate voter 
registration 
into 
required 

first-year student events, an 
idea outlined in the party’s 
platform.

The resolution, citing a 

study that found fewer than 
half of University students 
voted 
in 
2012 
and 
2014, 

states that since all first-
year students are required 
to attend various Welcome 
Week events organized by 
University 
Housing, 
they 

should also integrate voter 
registration into transitional 
activities.

After six months of meeting 

with the administration and 
the 
University’s 
Residence 

Hall 
Association, 
Jawad 

tabled a discussion wherein 
she 
argued 
incorporating 

voter 
registration 
into 

required University Housing 
activities makes the most 
sense.

“We think that if we can 

get 
freshman 
when 
they 

first come here who haven’t 
registered to vote yet to 
register, we’ll make it easy 
through the first meeting,” 
Jawad said.

Upon meeting with RHA 

and LSA student government, 
Jawad 
agreed 
with 

suggestions that the initiative 
must be a collaborative effort 
between 
all 
organizations 

involved with required first-
year student events.

RHA 
President 
Sujay 

Shetty, an LSA sophomore, 
endorsed the resolution, and 
placed it on the agenda for 
the next two RHA Executive 
Board Meeting agendas.

“I thought it was a great 

idea,” Shetty said. “I couldn’t 
find any factors which would 
make it so it shouldn’t be 
passed.”

During 
her 
presentation 

to 
the 
assembly, 
Jawad 

argued the most effective 
way 
to 
integrate 
voter 

registration into the first-
year events would be through 
incorporating 
it 
into 
RA 

training each year.

Karthik 
Duraisamy, 
an 

assistant 
professor 
in 
the 

Aerospace 
Engineering 

Department and his team 
received a grant from the 
U.S. 
Air 
Force 
Research 

Laboratories and the Air Force 
Office of Scientific Research 
to investigate computational 
simulations related to rocket 
engine safety. The team was 
considered an underdog in the 
field but beat out competition 
from the Georgia Institute 
of Technology and Stanford 
University for the $4.2 million 
grant.

Duraisamy said the problem 

his team hopes to solve for 
the Air Force is designing 
systems 
to 
make 
rocket 

takeoff safer. He emphasized 
that his team members are not 
rocket builders — that they 
are just refining a computer 
simulation that helps catalyze 
the design cycle.

“Instead 
of 
designing, 

building, testing, blowing up 
and going back to the drawing 
board, what we want to do is 
run simulations of it virtually 
on 
computers,” 
Duraisamy 

said. 

His 
project 
focuses 
on 

streamlining 
the 
process 

using computers rather than 
overhauling 
rocketry 
in 

general.

John 
Dudley 
Hutson, 
a 

former U.S. Navy officer and 
judge 
advocate 
general 
of 

the Navy, joined author and 
former Marine Phil Klay as 
well as former Army officer Ian 
Fishback Wednesday evening 
on a panel in the Ford School of 
Public Policy. The panel, part of 
Ford’s Policy Talk series, aimed 
to confront ambiguities created 
by the intersection of national 
security and human rights. The 
discussion was moderated by 
Hardy Vieux, the legal director 
at Human Rights First and the 
Ford School Towsley Foundation 
policymaker in residence.

Vieux 
directed 
his 
first 

question at Hutson, asking if the 
perception of human rights and 
national security as incompatible 
spheres still exists today. Hutson 
argued the two do not conflict, 
and instead, human rights form 
the basis for national security — 
especially in regard to the war on 
terror.

Panama Papers’ Bastian Obermeyer, Laurent Richard present as part of Dissonance Series 

Two Knight-Wallace Fellows, 

Bastian Obermayer and Laurent 
Richard, presented Wednesday 
evening on a panel titled “Privacy 
and 
Security 
Challenges 
in 

Investigative Journalism.” Law 

Prof. Gautam Hans facilitated 
the event, which was part of the 
Dissonance speaker series.

Obermayer and Richard were 

part of the team of journalists that 
published the Panama Papers, a 
leak of 11.5 million documents that 
belonged to the law firm Mossack 
Fonseca. 
These 
documents 

detailed how more than 200,000 

offshore entities served as shell 
corporations for uses such as tax 
evasion, fraud and other illegal 
purposes, with links to dozens of 
world leaders.

The 
panelists 
discussed 

keeping 
sensitive 
information 

from being disclosed and how to 
contact sources while maintaining 
their safety as journalists and the 

safety of the sources.

“The question of the privacy 

and the safety of the sources or 
the journalists have been always 
in the history of journalism very 
central,” Richard said.

Michigan will be the best place 
to live by 2100 AD, according 
to @PopSci. (Granted, it 
already is.)

Wolvereaders, a student-

run organization from the 

University of Michigan 

Community Scholars Program, 

brought Detroit Tigers mascot 

Paws to Ypsilanti’s Estabrook 

Elementary School Wednesday 

morning for a March is Reading 

Month event.

LSA sophomores Amani 

Echols and Maria Cholack 

founded the organization in 

2016. Wolvereaders travels to 

Estabrook every other week 

and helps second-graders read 

and write letters to their MCSP 

mentors. In an email interview, 

Echols said the organization’s 

goals include getting elementary 

school students excited about 

reading and higher education.

Cholack wrote in an email 

interview the students really 

enjoyed Paws’s appearance and 

she hopes it will inspire the 

children to develop a passion for 

reading.

“It was really rewarding 

to see the second graders so 

genuinely excited about a mascot 

that everyone loves,” Cholack 

wrote. “The students were 

very engaged in the reading 

activity, which was fantastic 

because we really wanted 

them to associate reading 

with having fun. Overall it 

was a great way to bring the 

second graders, University of 

Michigan students and faculty 

together.”

Echols wrote the event 

brought Estabrook into the 

Wolverine community.

“Inviting Paws to be our 

special guest for this week’s 

WolveReaders visit was a 

great change of pace for the 

second graders,” Echols wrote. 

“It was exciting to be able to 

see their faces light up and 

be so engaged in an activity 

centralized around reading 

comprehension. … The event 

was a great way to strengthen 

MCSP’s community partnership 

with the Ypsilanti Public School 

System, specifically Estabrook 

Elementary School.”

“You still have to design, 

build and test, but you don’t 
have to design, build and test 50 
designs — maybe you can just 
do three or four and substitute 
the rest of the information with 
computational 
simulations,” 

Duraisamy said. “So that’s our 
expertise — we are experts 
in 
computational 
modeling 

and simulation in this case 
of 
rocket 
combustors, 
but 

in general, many aerospace 
systems.”

Duraisamy also shared his 

thoughts on the technology 
being used for purposes that 
stray from its original intent.

“We give them efficient 

computational 
simulation 

techniques that they can use, 
so in some sense we are like 
tool-builders,” he said. “And 
that is all of basic science. If 
you take anything — if you 
take 
semiconductors, 
they 

were designed because of basic 
research and how they are used 
can be for good purposes or it 
can be used for evil purposes.”

He remained optimistic the 

project would have benevolent 
applications even if the Air 
Force’s agenda were to turn in 
a different direction.

“This is probably less likely 

to go into a missile than going 
into 
space 
and 
launching 

something,” Duraisamy said. 

Ph.D. candidate Nicholas 

Arnold, 
a 
member 
of 

Duraisamy’s 
team, 
said 

even those who intend to 
create 
weapons 
are 
not 

always responsible for their 
ramifications.

“Our research is generally 

for 
the 
research’s 
sake,” 

Arnold said. “If you read some 
books on the first stealth 
fighters and stuff like that — 
like the F-117 — Skunk Works 
and Lockheed Martin didn’t 
do the research that came up 
with the theory that made 
stealth work. Actually, the guy 
who found it found it in a paper 
that was published by a Soviet 
researcher.”

Assistant research scientist 

J.P. 
Sheehan, 
who 
works 

on electrical propulsion of 
rockets, spoke more generally 
on grants coming into the 
University.

“On one side, there’s money 

coming in to support students 
on an hourly basis, but also 
from a project standpoint, 
when a new project comes in, 
that means there’s going to be 
lots of work to do,” Sheehan 

said. “The fact that research 
going on at Michigan is very 
cutting-edge on the academic 
side and industry side is really 
important and adds a lot to the 
prestige of the degree.”

Captain 
Benjamin 
Song, 

assistant 
professor 
of 

aerospace studies concurred, 
saying grants like this one 
improve the standing of the 
University and the Air Force, 
and improve on already strong 
relations between the two. 
He said the effects of a good 
relationship can be felt by 

even by Air Force ROTC 
cadets who are majoring in 
aerospace engineering.

Duraisamy pointed out 

that the grant would also 
help the University on the 
recruiting front because it 
bolsters his reputation as a 
mentor.

“I 
always 
liken 

recruiting grad students 
and 
undergrads 
to 

recruiting 
basketball 

players — it’s the same 
thing, they have all of us 
from many different places 
and then they go with a 
coach,” he said.

Duraisamy talked about 

how the grant coming 
from a public entity was 
especially meaningful.

“Federal 
government 

research is always more 
adventurous, we all covet 
federal 
government 

funds,” he said. “We can 
propose very risky projects 
and 
it’s 
typically 
okay 

whereas private is a little 
bit more conservative.”

Michigan in Color
Thursday, March 23, 2017 — 3A

I began my freshman year the 

way most people do: completely 
unsure of what classes to take. I 
decided to take a class that would 
fulfill the Race and Ethnicity 
requirement so I would not have to 
take it again in my undergraduate 
career. I took a class on the history 
of Islam in South Asia because it 
fit my schedule. And though the 
class was informative overall as a 
history class, it had little to do with 
my experiences as a South Asian 
woman and nothing to do with 
inequities as they exist relating to 
ethnicity. This class, along with 
many of the other options for the 
requirement, does not fit with the 
original intent of the requirement, 
which was made as a response 
to a request made by the student 
group Black Action Movement III 
in 1990.

The 
race 
and 
ethnicity 

curriculum has been criticized on 
multiple occasions in the past, but 
to no avail. There are still many 
classes that, despite fulfilling the 
requirement, are not in line with 
the goal of teaching students the 
value of new perspectives. Thus, 
students can still graduate without 
having taken a course that truly 
challenges them to think about 
issues of race and ethnicity in a 
new way, and the requirement 
is often viewed as an obligation, 
rather than an opportunity to 
learn more about different ethnic 
and cultural communities. The 
University of Michigan also has 
yet to extend the requirement to 
other schools outside of LSA and 

Art & Design.

It was not until I started taking 

courses in the School of Education 
that I saw what the Race and 
Ethnicity requirement should look 
like. My “Education: Schooling 
and 
Multicultural 
Society” 

course not only taught about 
racial and economic inequities, 
but also teaches how to take 
that knowledge and use it in the 
classroom and careers. The class 
is discussion- and activity-based 
and focuses on discussing some 
of the nuances of these issues. 
This is a model that the Race and 
Ethnicity required classes should 
all be based on, so that not only 
are issues being taught, but they 
are also being discussed in a larger 
group.

This model is also particularly 

important when thinking about 
other disciplines which do not 
require students to take courses 
that both fulfill the Race and 
Ethnicity requirement and pertain 
to eradicating inequities in their 
own future career paths. Every 
class in the Race and Ethnicity 
requirement should be carefully 
selected so students leave the class 
feeling well-informed on issues of 
race and ethnicity that are timely 
and are equipped with the tools 
they need to inquire about these 
issues and be lifelong learners.

Refining the Race and Ethnicity 

requirement is just one of many 
possible proactive steps to create 
a more inclusive environment 
on campus, but it is still only an 
attempt to educate students on 
issues they should have learned 
about long before attending the 
University. And yet, since the 
truth of the state of American 

education currently is that many 
children do not get the education 
they need about race and ethnicity, 
ensuring students recieve this 
education in college has become 
even more important. Refining the 
requirement will also help take 
the burden off minority students 
who are expected to provide 
education to other students on 
diversity, which can sometimes 
encourage the tokenization of 
these students, who should not 
bear this responsibility in the first 
place.

And yet, it should be a 

collective effort to ensure that all 
students at the University get an 
education where current issues 
of diversity are being discussed 
in all classrooms, not just those 
that fit the “Race and Ethnicity” 
requirement. This is something 
that some student leaders have 
discussed, but also one that 
students complain about when 
there is discrimination on campus 
that is not being discussed in 
the classroom. The University’s 
faculty should be educated on 
issues of diversity and should try 
to build curricula with this ideal 
built in wherever it fits. Professors 
should not fear bringing up these 
issues, for it is the fear of discussing 
diversity that ultimately keeps 
open discussions from happening. 
It would not be difficult for a 
student to go through their entire 
academic career at the University 
without learning about diversity 
in a classroom setting. University 
administration has to react to an 
issue. The University must create a 
culture that fosters this discussion 
so diversity does not only come up 
as a reaction to hatred.

In the MiC Spotlight series, our 

editors and contributors reflect on 
the reasons they joined MiC and 
their hopes for their work and the 
section.

 
When I was a kid, I wanted to be 

an author.

As a perpetually insecure child, 

I never started a journal or a diary, 
never wrote outside of coursework, 
and never actually took any of the 
steps that would have made me a 
writer. I didn’t think anything I 
had to say was important or worth 
immortalizing. But still I kept my 
dream of being a writer tucked in 
my pocket, so no one could see it 
but I could feel safe knowing it was 
there. I always promised I would 
start writing when I got smart 
enough, talented enough, inspired 
enough.

That 
dream 
has 
mutated 

throughout my life. Ten-year-old 
me was convinced she was going 
to write a novel when she grew 
up; 15-year-old me knew that 
journalism was where she needed 
to be; 20-year-old me has accepted 
that she wants writing to be 
important to her career and refuses 
to stress about the specifics.

As my romantic notion of 

being an author shifted, so did 
my understanding of myself and 
my identity as a young Muslim 
woman. It’s not that I woke up one 
day shocked that I was brown and 
Muslim — it was that I realized 
that the experiences I had were 
not common among all people. 
Not everyone had normalized 
the idea that the government 
may be listening to their private 
conversations and not everyone 
stayed away from calling things 
“the bomb” unless they were telling 
a joke.

It became clear that the faint 

suspicions I had felt toward my 
novels were because I wasn’t seeing 
my story being told. And then I 
started thinking about what other 
stories weren’t being told. And then 
I started wondering why those 
stories might not be told. And then 
I thought about why it was those 
stories — often full of corruption 
and negligence and -isms. And then 
I started wondering what I could 
do to fix that. And then I decided 
to pursue a career in policy and 
stopped actively dreaming about 
being a writer.

But to write is to claim agency 

and ownership of a narrative that, 
for many people of color, has been 
dominated by the stories of others. 
To write is to give yourself and your 
community a voice, a platform, a 
moment to say: “I was here. I felt this. 
It was real and it was important.” To 

write is to be selfish and selfless, all 
at once. To write is to resist, on some 
level, the idea that who you are and 
what you experience is not valid and 
valuable and worth reading.

And so I’ve joined Michigan 

in Color as an editor as part of an 
attempt to return to that dream.

It is an honor to be part of a 

section that works so clearly to 
elevate the stories that are often 
untold or unheard, and I hope to 
use my time here engaging with 
writers to do just that. I hope that, 
in reading and writing our stories, 
you can find meaning, purpose, 
strength and solidarity as I often do.

- AREEBA HAIDER

Reflecting upon my upbringing, 

I realize how incredibly lucky I am 
to be writing this. As a transracial 
adoptee from Vietnam who came 
from a small province and a family 
that was deathly ill, I am grateful 
for and I am proud to raise my voice. 
Growing up, I had trouble raising my 
voice in challenging environments, 
because of my personal insecurities 
and often times not knowing where 
I stand. I was an agreeable giver, 
someone who gave myself to others 
while letting conflicting voices 
trample my own.

Since being involved in Michigan 

Community 
Scholars 
Program, 

Intergroup Relations, the Center 
for Positive Organizations and A/
PIA activist communities, I have 
grown to be strong in letting my 
voice be heard, because I have 
found spaces where I flourish. This 
strength has pushed me to navigate 
difficult conversations surrounding 
racial 
discrimination 
and 
the 

current social climate, primarily 
surrounding Asian and Pacific 
Islander American civil rights. As an 
Asian American, I am tired of being 
forced into the gray middle ground 
in the race conversation. Media 
often portrays us as wedge groups 
to be model examples to society, but 
we are far too often silenced as soon 
as we gain the confidence to speak.

Joining MiC was something 

I’ve longed for since I arrived to 
campus. The stories MiC publishes 
are 
powerful. 
MiC 
gives 
an 

unapologetic space for people of 
color to have their voices elevated. 
Personally, I remember reading 
Elise Jayakar’s article on her biracial 
experience. That piece inspired 
me to write, because it touched me 
in a way that will never leave me. 
So, my contribution will be giving 
myself wholly to a community that 
was built on being a deviant to the 
norm. I was given the extraordinary 
privilege to grow up in the United 
States and I am using every breath 
to elevate the voices, stories and 
narratives of those that have been 
silenced by the dominant narrative.

- ADAM BRODNAX

I’ve been told by others that I 

never hesitate to speak my mind. 
Since I was very young, I have 
always been able to unapologetically 
express my thoughts and feelings. 
I used to simply think that it was 
because I was bold or determined. 
However, as I grew older, I saw 
that many of my peers, especially 
those who were people of color, 
were unable to voice their opinions 
and were frequently disregarded. 
This made me ask myself why other 
people could not just say what they 
wanted to. It took me quite a while 
to find the answer to that question.

I recognize that I have an 

incredible amount of privilege 
as an upper-middle-class, South 
Asian woman. Quite often, people 
will take my word over that of 
others because I am assumed to 
be more hardworking and rational 
than other people of color. Unlike 
many of my peers, I rarely feel 
unsafe due to my ethnicity or 
religion. Furthermore, I grew up 
in an environment that was very 
supportive and encouraged me to 
be confident in myself. I can only 
hope to provide other people with 
a fraction of the opportunities that 
allowed me to find my voice.

I have been involved in social 

justice organizations, including the 
South Asian Awareness Network 
and Uncover: A/PIA, in the hopes 
that I can use my privilege to 
help bring about social change 
on campus. Likewise, I wish to 
continue to use my privilege in 
order to bring about awareness 
through writing. As a senior editor 
of Michigan in Color, I want to 
help provide a space for people of 
color to share their stories and life 
experiences. I, along with the other 
editors of Michigan in Color, will 
always work to amplify your voices 
and to make your voices echo for 
others to hear.

I have shared my story and have 

been heard. Now, it’s your turn to 
speak up. If you have something to 
say, just let me know and I’ll be sure 
to pass you the MiC.

- SIVANTHY VASANTHAN

I learned, pretty early on, that 

mainstream media does not make 
books, TV shows or movies for my 
consumption. I gave up on writing 
as a career a long time ago, before 
I ever really gave myself a fair shot 
at it, because I thought no one else 
would either. South Asian voices 
in media are reduced to archaic 
stereotypes 
or 
exoticized; 
our 

experiences are never our own 
— they are constructed through 
the lenses of those who don’t care 
enough to tell our stories without 
embarrassing us. Even when they 
are, prominent mainstream South 
Asian creators, such as Mindy 
Kaling and Priyanka Chopra, refuse 
to acknowledge their backgrounds, 

cultures and histories without 
sounding tone-deaf and ignorant.

That is why I joined MiC. I might 

not be a seasoned writer or an active 
member of the creative community 
anymore, but this forum is one 
of the few places I feel capable of 
taking charge of my own story: 
because I get to tell it.

- TANYA MADHANI

In my last Spotlight, I wrote 

about how finding my voice as a 
Filipino-American, removing my 
shame as one and strongly wanting 
to help other people of color do the 
same is why I joined Michigan in 
Color. All of that still remains the 
same. Working for Michigan in 
Color has been without a doubt one 
of the most rewarding experiences 
of my life, because I got to do exactly 
what I sought out to do.

When I think about why I return 

to Michigan in Color, I can’t help 
but be reminded of the wonderful 
people who have helped me along 
the way: former Michigan in Color 
managing 
editors 
Toni 
Wang 

and Demario Longmire. Their 
hard work and activism has truly 
inspired me to raise up my voice 
as 
a 
Filipino-American. 
They 

would never hesitate to ensure that 
whatever experience or emotion 
I and the other contributors and 
fellow MiC editors felt on any 
particular day, hour or minute 
was completely OK and valid. 
They took the time to critically 
unpack anything problematic so no 
privileged stone was left unturned 
and unchecked. I also want to take 
this moment to say that they are 
hilarious people. I would also like 
to give a special shoutout to Sabrina 
Bilimoria and Alyssa Brandon 
— past senior editors who also 
are doing #work on campus and 
beyond that are absolutely amazing. 
They have helped cultivate a sense 
of community that I may not have 
thought I deserved, but definitely 
needed.

It is important to me that I 

continue that legacy.

I return to Michigan in Color 

because it is not solely about doing 
work I enjoy. It is about doing 
the work I think is critical at this 
point in time. I want to continue 
to foster the sense of belonging for 
people of color that others have 
done provided for me. I find it so 
necessary to document the complex 
experiences of those marginalized 
so that we never forget but to also 
extend our solidarity to others who 
may feel a similar way. I am here to 
pass down the MiC to fellow people 
of color to share their stories during 
every step of the process.

In another year at Michigan 

in Color, I want to say this to all 
people of color reading this, YOU 
AND 
YOUR 
EXPERIENCES 

ARE VALID AND DON’T LET 

ANYONE OR ANYTHING TELL 
YOU OTHERWISE.

- CHRISTIAN PANEDA

Storytelling has been a powerful 

force through my life. As a child, it 
was through listening to narratives 
from my parents and grandmother 
— all of whom immigrated to the 
United States from India in the 
early 1990s — that I was able to 
learn about my roots and heritage. 
Storytelling did what none of my 
elementary 
school 
classrooms 

could do by eliciting a vivid sense 
of curiosity and appreciation for my 
culture.

Now, as a student at the 

University of Michigan, I reflect 
on both the spoken and unspoken 
stories of our campus. I am 
grateful to have had a multitude of 
opportunities to learn about social 
justice, identities and activism: My 
participation as a peer educator 
in the Sexual Assault Prevention 
and Awareness Center’s primary 
prevention program has heightened 
my understanding of the ways in 
which sexual and domestic violence 
pervade our society. Since my first 
year, Alternative Spring Break has 
challenged me to think critically 
about what it means to ethically 
engage with different communities 
around me and address the savior-
ism that often surrounds service. 
These opportunities have been and 
continue to be incredibly important 
in shaping my understanding of 
social justice.

But these organizations focus 

primarily on how we practice 
activism and prevent harm. This is 
not to say that these pillars are not 
important; on the contrary, they are 
essential if we wish to understand 
how 
communities 
can 
come 

together and challenge systems 
of oppression and harm. Indeed, 
these organizations are driven by a 
different kind of passion than that 
found in the written word.

Serving as a senior editor for 

Michigan in Color provides a 
unique opportunity to hear from 
those members of our campus 
community 
who 
have 
been 

harmed by these systems, whose 
hearts are brimming with stories 
— raw, intimate and unapologetic 
ones — that need to be listened 
to. I am honored to step into this 
role and learn, not only from my 
fellow editors, but also from the 
contributors who bravely allow 
their truths to soar. If my presence 
in MiC makes it even slightly more 
possible for you to be heard, then I 
have done my duty.

- NEEL SWAMY

My absolute favorite thing has 

always been to sing. When I was 
7, my brother helped me express 
my love of singing through song 
writing. From then on, creative 

writing became an outlet for all 
of my passions. I began to write 
fantasies and dramas to express 
myself. I grew up taking honors 
and AP English classes but I did not 
enjoy writing academically. When 
I took my first English class at the 
University of Michigan, I began 
to see writing in a different light. 
I became an activist through my 
writing and I realized the power my 
words had to inspire and empower 
others. Writing was a means of self-
discovery for me.

I have recently been thinking 

a lot about identities. Growing 
up, I never felt like I belonged to a 
specific category. I was constantly 
juggling between my identities as a 
Nigerian, American, Black, Muslim 
woman with sickle cell anemia. 
Then I started learning about the 
intersection of identities. I began to 
realize that no one fits into simply 
one group but rather we all belong 
at the intersection of multiple. My 
involvement with the educational 
theater company showed me that 
our identities create the lens through 
which we perceive the world around 
us. I realize that I am so much more 
than a race, religion or disease — yet 
these are the identities I think about 
the most.

To celebrate Martin Luther King 

Jr. Day, I went to a one-woman 
multimedia 
performance 
called 

“One Drop of Love,” by Fanshen 
Cox DiGiovanni. She acted out her 
life, even the painful moments, to an 
audience of strangers because she 
believes her story needs to be told. I 
started sharing my story for a similar 
reason. I wrote how I felt to better 
cope with and understand what I 
was feeling. Along the way I realized 
my story could move others the way 
Fanshen’s moved me.

I joined MiC because I was 

inspired by the people I knew who 
were involved. I resonated with the 
passion they had for the work they 
were doing. They presented MiC 
to me as a place where my presence 
would be welcomed, my voice would 
be heard, and my story would be 
praised. When I started writing I 
knew MiC would be the best place 
to publish. MiC editors helped me 
harness my voice by making sure 
my words accurately portrayed the 
message I wanted to get across. I 
was incredibly happy and proud of 
the finished product they helped me 
create. After my first publication, I 
knew that if I were given the chance, 
I would want to do what they did for 
me for someone else. Now, as a senior 
editor for MiC, I hope I can help 
others find and share their voices. I 
acknowledge how hard it can be to 
share your story, but I promise I will 
uphold it and you with the greatest 
respect. Your story is welcomed 
here. This is part of mine, so I invite 
you to share yours.

Re-defining the Race and 
Ethnicity Requirement

RABAB JAFRI

MiC Columnist

Please stop asking Black boys 
why they don’t play sports

MiC Spotlight: Senior Editors

We are currently in the thick 

of March Madness, a time of year 
when it seems as though everyone 
is an expert in all things basketball. 
People are filling out brackets, 
making 
bets 
and 
anxiously 

watching as many games as they 
possibly can. This time, more than 
ever, I am reminded of one of the 
things that annoyed me most during 
my childhood, along with being 
the cause of a lot of anxiety and 
decreased self-esteem. When I met 
new people, usually adults, or saw 
family members whom I did not see 
on a regular basis, they would ask 
me, “Do you play any sports?” Now 
this in itself is harmless. Every given 
year, I was one of the tallest people 
in my grade. After my awkward pre-
teen phase, I slimmed down and 
started to work out at my mom’s gym 
occasionally. It was not unusual for 
people to comment on my “athletic” 
physique, and the affirmation was a 
positive reinforcement. It really was 
no surprise that people thought I 
would be an athlete.

In reply to the aforementioned 

question, “Do you play any sports?” 
I would simply say no and smile. 
However awkward, all of this is 
fine and completely normal. Sports 
are a big part of American culture 
and most of my peers played them. 
So what was the issue? It lay in one 
word: Why?

Now this always seemed like a 

very loaded question, and I never 
knew exactly how to respond. I 
would say, “I’m just not into them,” 
or something of the sort. If I was 
lucky, they would leave it at that; 
however, sometimes they would say 
some pretty demoralizing things. 
One family member even told me 
that I was “a waste of height and 
size.” This comment bothered me 
for obvious reasons, but mostly 
because it seemed like people were 
never interested in all of my other 
qualities and interests. I enjoyed 
reading 
books 
on 
presidential 

history, catching up on politics and 
cooking new foods.

For a short period in middle 

school, I played baseball and ran 
track. Though I liked the challenge 
and opportunity to spend time 
with my friends outside of school, 
I knew that I was not an athlete. I 
actually fractured my ankle sliding 
into home base and was forced to 
wear a cast and then a boot for the 
better part of a year. Nonetheless, 
this piece is not at all my attempt 
at criticizing athletes or organized 
sports. I am not oblivious to the 
many positive effects that sports can 
have on youth: the ability to bond as 
a team, have a sense of responsibility 
and opportunity to compete with 
peers by constructive means are 
just some of the benefits. In more 
urban communities, specifically, 
sports can be pivotal in establishing 
a relationship between a coach and 
his players where many of them 

may not have a paternal figure in 
their lives. Sports can also give an 
out to students looking to escape 
violence and other disadvantageous 
situations.

However, 
in 
the 
Black 

community, sports are sometimes 
viewed 
as 
the 
only 
way 
to 

prosperity. This could be because 
the entertainment industry has 
for so long capitalized on the 
athletic ambitions of Black boys 
in conjunction with the general 
public’s appetite to consume such 
media. This, all the while collecting 
the lion’s share of multi-million 
dollar profits. For example, about 
three in four NBA players are Black; 
however, owners in the league are 
almost exclusively white.

I want my point to be clear: 

Stop asking Black boys why they 
don’t play sports because it is 
in turn reducing them to your 
entertainment. Instead, start seeing 
Black boys as intellectuals. Start 
seeing Black boys as artists, public 
servants and CEOs.

Let’s encourage more Black youth 

to code, draw and write columns for 
their school paper. The world needs 
more Black leaders, and today’s kids 
have to be inspired to chase those 
dreams. And with all of that being 
said, it is crucial to still acknowledge 
that kids can be whatever they want 
in life. So, if after you’ve encouraged 
him to be ambitious, and that Black 
boy wants to be a basketball player, 
go to the bleachers and cheer him 
on.

R

hetoric 
since 
the 

inauguration and, more 
specifically, since the 

start of the political right’s 
efforts to create an 
Affordable Care Act 
repeal-and-replace 
bill, has perpetuated 
a 
narrative 
that 

Washington is in a 
state of disarray. Thus 
far, a constructive 
dialogue 
has 
not 

been encouraged, but 
rather, 
figureheads 

on both the right and 
left have relied on 
hateful rebuke and criticism. 

Various media outlets have 

greeted House Speaker Paul 
Ryan with an outpouring of 
disapproval from the moment he 
revealed his repeal-and-replace 
plan. From The Washington 
Post claiming Paul Ryan is “the 
enemy of the right,” to Mark 
Levin 
at 
the 
Conservative 

Review dubbing the bill as 
“RINOcare”(RINO 
being 
a 

common party insult meaning 
“Republican In Name Only”) 
there has been nothing shy 
about popular reaction to its 
unveiling.

Before 
we 
condemn 
the 

present, though, it is crucial to 
examine our past. For the past 
eight years, Washington saw 
strong-arming at its finest. The 
prototypical legislative process 
was not merely hidden but 
forgotten, as former President 
Barack Obama continued to 
thumb his nose at Congress.

His 
prime 
focus 
and 

political baby was christened 
“Obamacare” — a piece of 
legislation that he effectively 
rammed 
through 
Congress 

without 
any 
bipartisan 

approval. As it was crafted 
behind 
closed 
doors 
with 

virtually no transparency, the 
American 
public 
innocently 

listened to a host of specious 
claims growing more and more 
misguided on a variety of its 
principles along the way.

The 
takeaway: 
As 

Republicans had no stake in 
the plan, Obama and chief 
Democrats received all the 
credit. Yet, in due time, as we 
are seeing now, the Democrats 
are receiving the brunt of the 

blame for its “implosion” (i.e., 
premium increases, dwindling 
competition, etc.)

Herein 
lies 
our 
current 

dilemma. 
Negotiating the here 
and now should not 
take 
on 
a 
binary 

approach — say yes to 
the Republicans’ new 
plan or align yourself 
with 
Obamacare’s 

failures — but rather, 
a collaborative one. 
In a New York Times 
op-ed 
piece, 
Ohio 

Gov. 
John 
Kasich 

writes, “A true and lasting 
reform of the health insurance 
system must be accomplished by 
bringing the two sides together.”

Former 
President 
Obama 

conveyed a very important 
message to Republicans and 
Democrats alike: Unilateralism 
is 
not 
the 
way 
forward. 

Pursuing this avenue marked 
by self-reliance and egotism 
only divides our nation even 
further. It appears as if the 
current man in the Oval Office 
is taking this advice to heart, as 
he has mentioned that though 
Ryan’s bill is the appropriate 
vehicle, it must be modified 
down the road.

In a recent interview with 

Tucker Carlson on Fox News, 
President 
Trump 
refrained 

from completely jumping on 
board with the bill by saying, 
“It’s very preliminary … but (it) 
is going to be negotiated.” In 
other words, Trump is doing 
what he does best: deal-making. 
His measured approach should 
sound all too familiar to those 
who have read his bestseller 
“The Art of the Deal.” As he 
details, the key to success is to 
keep one’s options open, not 

entirely committing to one plan 
and seeking dialogue.

In a recent briefing, Sean 

Spicer, 
the 
White 
House 

press secretary, laid out this 
approach very carefully when 
he commented: “… regardless 
of what caucus or faction 
you’re a part of, if you have 
an idea that can enhance this 
bill and make it more patient-
centric and achieve the goals, 
then we’re all for it. So that’s 
a process. … There have been a 
lot of ideas, a lot of debate, and 
a lot of issues put forward into 
how to craft this.”

Given the past eight years, 

it is of paramount importance 
that we redefine our vision and 
identify what we are discussing 
here — real-life humans and 
politics. Spicer describes that 
the current administration is in 
the business of creating policies 
that benefit the patient. With 
this approach, the individual 
transcends 
partisanship. 

Reaching across the aisle is a 
necessity, as is reciprocity once 
such a gesture is made.

And as for our political 

landscape, we must realize that 
we, along with our politicians, 
are not in Kansas anymore. The 
ground beneath Washington’s 
feet has changed and, though 
we may not be walking down 
a yellow brick road, it is 
one that has potential. We 
have returned to a political 
environment 
conducive 

to 
consensus 
building 
and 

productive negotiation.

Whether 
we 
want 
to 

acknowledge it or not, when 
it comes to legislation, we are 
fortunate to have a pair of 
overseeing eyes with a diverse 
perspective 
in 
President 

Trump. In order to fulfill this 
mandate of patient-oriented 
policy, the right and the left 
need to abandon their once-
fixed, 
isolationist 
mindsets. 

Productive dialogue is the 
way 
forward 
and 
with 
a 

businessman now living at 
1600 Pennsylvania Ave., they 
need to decide if they want to 
make a deal or not.

I insist they make the deal.

“Deal or No Deal?”

Nicholas Tomaino can be reached at 

ntomaino@umich.edu.

I

n February 2012, I was 
sitting 
on 
my 
couch, 

wearing 
my 
UConn 

basketball jersey and watching 
my team take on Villanova. 
The game was in overtime 
with UConn up by two points 
when Villanova drove down 
the court and tied it up with 
six seconds left. The ball was 
inbounded to UConn’s star 
point guard, Shabazz Napier, 
who then sprinted up the court 
and hit the game-winning shot 
as time expired. I jumped up 
onto the table screaming in 
excitement. This could be our 
year, I thought. 

That 
night 
I 
slept 
easy, 

dreaming of a deep March 
Madness run for the Huskies. 
I was later shocked when I 
discovered who did not sleep 
easy that night: Shabazz Napier, 
the very player who won the 
game for his team. As it turned 
out, 
Napier 
couldn’t 
always 

afford food to eat, and spent 
many nights going to bed hungry.

While 
the 
NCAA 
has 

since passed legislation that 
allows 
student-athletes 
to 

receive unlimited meal plans 
from the schools that they 
attend, there are still many 
underlying issues with the 
current distribution of profit.

In 
recent 
times, 
college 

sports 
have 
become 

increasingly 
lucrative. 
The 

NCAA makes billions of dollars 
in television and sponsorship 
deals each year, yet no one quite 
seems to know where all of that 

money is going. While college 
executives make millions, the 
athletes whom they exploit do 
not receive any share of these 
immense profits.

Under current NCAA rules, 

college athletes are not allowed 
to be compensated in any way. 
This includes money made 
from jersey sales, signatures, 
endorsements 
or 
even 

donations made by generous 
boosters. If players are caught 
in violation of these rules, 
they will be punished with a 
suspension that could seriously 
hurt their dreams of playing 
professional sports, as well as 
their future bank accounts.

Furthermore, 
college 

athletes 
are 
expected 
to 

commit dozens of hours a week 
toward practice, in addition to 
the hours spent on schoolwork. 
This means that even if they 
wanted 
to, 
they 
couldn’t 

possibly get a job to earn 
enough money for food and 
other living expenses. This, 
coupled with the physical and 
mental stress caused by their 
hours of hard work, certainly 
shows that they should be paid 
enough to cover their basic 
living expenses.

Though the NCAA publicly 

states that college players are 
first and foremost students, it 
is clear that players are actually 
seen as assets. If they play better, 
more people begin to watch, 
which means more money in 
the NCAA’s pocket. It’s only fair 
for the athletes to share in these 

increased profits.

Though 
the 
NCAA’s 

restrictions seem absurd, they 
do have some logic behind 
them. The NCAA does not 
want college sports to become 
a version of professional free 
agency, where players only 
choose a school based on how 
much money the school offers 
to pay them. But this should 
not prevent student-athletes 
like Napier from being able to 
afford basic necessities.

Thus, a reasonable solution 

to this problem would be 
to pay all athletes the same 
amount, 
no 
matter 
what 

school they attend. And even 
if this idea is not adopted, 
players should still be allowed 
to make money off of their own 
names, through jersey sales, 
signatures and endorsements.

Additionally, 
if 
college 

athletes were to be paid, they 
would be more likely to stay 
in school longer. This would 
improve the quality of play, 
which 
would 
attract 
more 

viewers. And since more viewers 
would mean more profits for 
the NCAA, it wouldn’t even 
be losing that much money by 
paying athletes a small stipend.

It is clear that college athletes 

are 
treated 
like 
employees; 

without the student-athletes, 
the NCAA would not exist. Thus, 
athletes should receive their fair 
share of the spoils generated by 
the work they put in.

Pay student athletes

NICHOLAS TOMAINO | COLUMN

I 

have to say, this year 
had real potential to be 
different. The ridiculous 

genesis of meaningless, self-
important parties with shelf 
lives of about three minutes 
spit out, entirely by accident it 
seems, two interesting options. 
On the one hand, eMerge, 
a 
model 
of 
representation 

sporting 
a 
list 
of 
diverse 

candidates, 
each 
of 
whom 

has a proven track record 
in student government. On 
the other, Movement takes 
a different approach based 
on 
accessibility, 
unity 
and 

participation, exemplified in 
part by candidates at the top of 
the ticket who would be new to 
Central Student Government.

Such stark contrast between 

the two would pose, I thought, 
some important questions to 
the student body. What kind of 
representation are we looking 
for? Is student government 
experience 
a 
necessary 

prerequisite to the position 
of CSG president, or can the 
bureaucratic bubble of student 
government be a hindrance? 
Or both? In the wake of an 
objectively 
productive 
and 

successful 
Schafer-Griggs 

term, what went right? What 
could be done better? Perhaps 
most importantly, what do we, 
as Wolverines, expect from 
CSG? We could have asked 
these questions. But we decided 
to take the easier route. We got 
distracted by a video.

The first word that I used to 

describe Movement’s “official 
anthem” was brilliant. Rather 
than 
running 
a 
campaign 

that we’ve seen before, with 
slightly different 
font 
and 

a new slogan, a new breed 
of dog paraded around the 
Diag or an exciting new 
strategy to cover the tables 
of the Shapiro Undergraduate 
Library in quarter-sheets, they 
were having fun with it. I saw, 
quite simply, two guys dancing 
(somewhat goofily, I might 
add) around campus with their 
friends and trying to bring 
attention to their campaign. 
They dropped some lyrics about 
giving the campus back to the 
students, and how you don’t 
have to have CSG experience to 
have an idea about improving 
campus. Was it the highest 
form of political commentary 
I’ve seen in my life? Absolutely 
not. 
The 
most 
memorable 

line was about putting Chick-
fil-A in the Michigan Union. 
It was a stunt, and one that 
was generating more attention 
for a CSG race than I’d ever 

seen before in my time at the 
University of Michigan.

But 
then, 
quickly 
and 

effortlessly, it consumed the 
campaign. In a column for 
The 
Michigan 
Daily, 
Evan 

Rosen 
was 
compared 
to 

Donald Trump, while another 
op-ed 
labeled 
Movement 

“not 
serious.” 
The 
party 

was branded with cultural 
appropriation and Facebook 
comment sections ran wild.

Let’s take this point by 

point. First of all, anyone who 
compares 
Rosen 
to 
Trump 

is 
being 
lazy, 
purposefully 

inflammatory and downright 
rude. In my personal experience, 
he is down-to-earth, friendly 
and has perfectly normal-sized 
hands. Sure, he may not be the 
most experienced candidate, 
but the CSG president doesn’t 
walk around campus with the 
nuclear football, so let’s all calm 
down a bit. Being an outsider 
can be a phenomenal asset.

Secondly, 
Movement 

is 
serious. 
If 
you 
looked 

beyond the video, or even 
read the comments posted 
by 
Movement’s 
Facebook 

page in response, you’d see 
an 
innovative 
platform, 

including 
proposals 
for 

improved lighting on Central 
Campus, 
an 
expansion 
of 

SafeRide hours, a campaign 
focusing 
on 
mental 
health 

and the “4 Years” initiative 
for success. Even without all 
this, let me be the first to say 
that seriousness is not the 
first quality I look for in my 
student representatives; this 
is partially because I’m voting 
for student representatives, not 
U.S. senators.

Cultural 
appropriation 
is 

obviously a serious issue, on 
our campus and many others. 
Personally, I don’t think the 
video was a culprit of it, and 
I reject the idea that there’s 
anything inherently offensive 
about a white guy rapping. Nor 
is there anything inherently 
wrong 
with 
comparing 

yourself to a famous inventor 
like 
George 
Washington 

Carver to prove that you’re 
innovative (in fact, it’s pretty 
obviously a compliment to 
George Washington Carver). 
But if that’s a conversation 
to have, let’s have it, rather 
than foaming at the mouth 
and 
jumping 
at 
the 
first 

opportunity for outrage. Let’s 
figure out why we disagree, and 
how we can come to a campus-
wide consensus, rather than 
shouting down the opposition 
for something we see as clear-

cut and “beyond debate.”

Let me be clear. I am not 

here to endorse the Movement 
party. I see the argument that 
Rosen and Dan Sweeney don’t 
represent the most diverse 
perspectives 
on 
campus. 
I 

just also acknowledge that 
Anushka Sarkar and Nadine 
Jawad have blind spots of 
their own. I see the argument 
that 
there 
was 
a 
clear 

objectification of women in the 
video, but I also recognize that 
it was a video and not their slate 
of candidates, which includes 
strong, 
intelligent 
women. 

I agree with some of the 
comments that were posted 
under the video, but I also have 
great respect for the poise and 
professionalism with which 
Movement 
responded 
(and 

eventually apologized). But 
no one seems to be able to get 
past the video and everyone 
seems interested in telling 
you exactly how heinous they 
think it is.

Personally, 
I 
voted 
for 

candidates from all four major 
parties. I simply want to make 
the point that the video and 
its narrative did not have to 
take over the campaign. It 
could have been about issues 
— diversity, inclusion, campus 
safety, campus culture and 
activism. Instead, Rosen had to 
leave in the middle of a debate 
hosted by The Michigan Daily 
to attend a hearing addressing 
two formal complaints about 
the video filed by his opponents. 
Because debating is much easier 
when not everyone gets the 
chance to make their case.

There 
are 
hundreds 
of 

reasons to vote for eMerge, 
and hundreds to vote for 
Movement. 
There 
was 
a 

discussion 
to 
be 
had. 
As 

we learned from the 2016 
presidential 
race, 
however, 

polarization and outrage can 
be a lot more exciting. So we 
did that instead.

Maybe next year, we as a 

student body will look back and 
realize that putting the issues 
facing our campus aside and 
centering in on a purposefully 
ridiculous video was just that — 
ridiculous. Or, maybe, student 
government at the University 
will continue to be an exercise 
of 
self-importance, 
long-

winded Facebook posts and 
stories rather than substance. 
Unfortunately, one seems more 
likely to me than the other.

‘M’ continues postseason run

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball team wants to hang a 
banner in Crisler this season — 
and winning 
the WNIT is 
its last hope. 
In the third 
round of the 
tournament 
on Thursday 
night, 
the 

Wolverines 
(11-5 Big Ten, 
24-9 overall) 
will face off 
against 
St. 

John’s, a team 
no current player has ever faced. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

But while the Red Storm (10-7 

Big East, 22-11 overall) might 
be unfamiliar to the players, 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico is very well-acquainted 
with them. Barnes Arico coached 
St. John’s for a decade before 
starting at Michigan in 2012, 
making the matchup personal.

“I’ve had an opportunity to 

coach a lot of the (former) players 
that will be coaching tomorrow,” 

Barnes Arico said on WTKA 
Radio.

Since she has worked with 

many of the Red Storm’s staff 
members, one might expect 
similar coaching styles, but St. 
John’s will almost certainly 
have a different game plan than 
Arico’s Wolverines.

“They’re 
a 
tough 
team,” 

Barnes Arico said. “They are 
a really defensive team. They 
hold their opponents to about 
60 points a game. They’re very 
different than we are, so it’s going 
to be important for us to get out 
and transition and play our style 
of play and not really allow them 
to slow down the tempo.”

Michigan is known for its 

high-scoring 
offensive 
trio 

of 
freshman 
guard 
Kysre 

Gondrezick, sophomore center 
Hallie Thome and junior guard 
Katelynn Flaherty, who average 
50.1 points per game together. 
St. John’s is also led by a trio of 
double-digit scorers, but forward 
Jade Walker and guards Akina 
Wellere and Aaliyah Lewis tally 
just 36.4 points on average.

Recently, Michigan has been 

picking up more points from 

other players. Junior forward 
Jillian 
Dunston 
scored 
eight 

points against Wright State in 
the second round of the WNIT. 
In the first round, senior Siera 
Thompson picked up 10 points and 
sophomore guard Nicole Munger 
added nine to finish off Kent State.

The 
Wolverines 
ran 
into 

problems in their last regular-
season games as they were 
unable to compensate for other 
teams guarding their leading 
scorers closely. But in this 
tournament so far, Michigan 
has utilized its role players more 
effectively on offense.

Yet, the Red Storm have a few 

advantages over the Wolverines. 
St. John’s has six players who 
have tallied over 100 rebounds, 
while Michigan only has four. 
The Red Storm have also blocked 
144 shots this season, compared 
to the Wolverines’ 111.

With a crack-down on defense, 

Michigan will need to continue 
to use all five players to rack up 
points; and with all the extra 
postseason practice, several less 
familiar faces may continue to 
see more minutes.

“We really gave everyone an 

opportunity to contribute and 
to show that they deserve some 
minutes during this run here 
in the WNIT,” Barnes Arico 
said. “(Senior guard) Danielle 
Williams just had an outstanding 
week and she got the start 
(against Kent State). And she’s a 
senior that hasn’t played a ton of 
minutes all year and could have 
hung her head and pouted but 
really responded.

“(Forward) KeAsja Peace — 

one of our freshmen who hasn’t 
played a lot of minutes, but a big 
kid inside — she got a chance to 
get in the game. Kayla Robbins is 
another freshman who has really 
shown the ability to give us some 
great minutes.”

Both teams are trying to 

make program history in this 
tournament. The Red Storm are 
fighting for their first appearance 
in the quarterfinals of the WNIT, 
while Michigan lost in the 
quarterfinals in both of its past 
two seasons. But the Wolverines 
have a big target on their back. 

“Everybody is gunning for 

us,” Barnes Arico said. “I think 
everybody thinks that we’re one 
of the best teams in the WNIT.”

Senior guard Danielle Williams played her way into the starting lineup against Kent State in the first round of the WNIT last week at Crisler Center.

Michigan rallies for win

Western Michigan centerfielder 

Tanner Allison hit a liner into the 
right-field gap to start a scoring 
barrage 
that put the 
Michigan 
baseball 
team in a three-run hole in the 
second inning.

But the Wolverines’ offensive 

stagnation quickly subsided, and 
No. 18 Michigan (16-4) scored four 
runs in the fourth inning to take 
the lead for good.

“I felt like when they put up 

three runs it’s no different than 
being in a fight,” said Michigan 
coach Erik Bakich. “You take a 
punch and you just have to get back 
up and deliver a punch.”

Junior starting pitcher Jayce 

Vancena took the mound for the 
Wolverines in what would be a 
back-and-forth game, ending in a 
6-4 victory for Michigan. 

Western Michigan pitcher Chris 

Modrzynski started the game 
strong, shutting out the Wolverines 
through the first three innings. 
Michigan was making solid contact 
— senior catcher Harrison Wenson 
lined a bullet to right field in the 
second inning for an out — but 
nothing seemed to fall.

In the second inning, Vancena’s 

outing looked bleak. The Broncos 
strung together four hits and 
scored on a fielder’s choice as a 
result of a pickle between first and 
second, taking a three-run lead.

The Wolverines were quick to 

respond, though, as they put their 
own surge of offense together 

in the fourth inning. Redshirt 
sophomore left fielder Miles Lewis 
started the push with an infield 
hit. 
Senior 
outfielder 
Johnny 

Slater walked, and after a passed 
ball advanced the two runners, 
Wenson singled to left to score 
them both.

“We just had to see the ball 

deep,” Wenson said. “And that’s 
what we did. We had a big inning 
there, scored a few runs and 
turned the game around.”

The last two runs in the inning 

came from a sacrifice fly from 
sophomore right fielder Jonathan 
Engelmann and a single from 
sophomore second baseman Ako 
Thomas that brought in Wenson 
and designated hitter Nick Poirier, 
respectively.

“That’s what I like about our 

offense,” Bakich said. “We have 
multiple ways of scoring. We’re 
not just a sit-back-and-try-to-hit-
home-runs kind of offense.”

Michigan played the small game 

right, as single runs in the fifth 
and eighth innings, respectively, 
extended the lead to three.

Freshman 
reliever 
Tommy 

Henry closed out the game and 
collected a hard-earned save as he 
let up one run that was initiated by 
a bunt for a hit.

The win caps off the Wolverines’ 

non-conference play as they travel 
to College Park to face off against 
Maryland this weekend, a team 
predicted ahead of Michigan in the 
Big Ten coaches’ preseason poll. 
The Wolverines will have to bring 
their same mentality to throw 
some punches at the Terrapins if 
they want to establish themselves 
in the conference.

Vancena wins on mound

Jayce Vancena’s first start on the 

mound for the Michigan baseball 
team since his freshman year was 
a good one. 

The junior right-hander pitched 

five innings and earned a win for 
the Wolverines against Western 
Michigan on Wednesday, 6-4.

During his freshman year, 

Vancena started five games and 
made 17 appearances on the 
mound. During his sophomore 
campaign, though, he made just 15 
appearances and no starts.

He ended last season with a 

5.10 earned-run average and a 2-1 
record, but this season has already 
shown signs of improvement.

“He earned it,” said Michigan 

coach Erik Bakich. “He’s worked 
extremely hard, and the game has 
a funny way of rewarding hard 
workers. It just seems to happen.”

Entering 
today’s 
game, 

Vancena’s ERA was 1.64 through 11 
innings. He opened Wednesday’s 
contest with a 1-2-3 inning, 
allowing his defense to field a 
groundout, lineout and flyout.

The second inning proved 

more troublesome for the righty. 
He faced the Broncos most 
prolific threat on offense in 
Tanner Allison, who currently is 
batting .435. Allison started the 
offense off with a double to center 
field, and his teammates quickly 
followed suit.

Jesse Forestell brought Allison 

home for Western Michigan. 
Vancena managed to get out of the 

inning with two strikeouts and a 
tag between first and second, but 
that was after the Broncos tacked 
on two more runs to go up 3-0.

“His fastball was a little up 

in the zone,” said senior catcher 
Harrison Wenson. “So what I just 
tried to tell him was just, ‘Stay 
within yourself, calm down, fill 
up the lower part of the zone.’ And 
that’s what he did.”

Vancena appeared to make 

the necessary corrections in the 
following innings, retiring the last 
nine batters he faced in order.

Fortunately 
for 
Vancena, 

Michigan had an offensive surge 
in the fourth inning in which it 
scored four runs, led by Wenson’s 
double to left field that earned him 
two RBI.

That rewarded Vancena with 

a win for an outing in which 
he threw 65 pitches and four 
strikeouts. But more impressively, 
he has yet to walk a batter the 
entire season.

“We 
always 
talk 
about 

throwing at the knees,” Vancena 
said. “That’s something that 
myself and a lot of our pitchers 
take pride in, in throwing strikes 
and throwing down in the zone 
to make it tough for the hitters 
to hit.”

With a successful game under 

his belt, Vancena can be confident 
he will be seeing the field more. 
How many starts he will earn is 
still in question, as it all depends 
on if he is needed in relief. But as 
long as he is rested, he proved he 
can be trusted to go out and try for 
a second win.

Sweet 16 Preview: ‘M’ to battle Oregon

This isn’t just a feel-good story 

anymore. 

Thirteen days ago, it was about 

the 
plane, 

the 
practice 

jerseys and the 
improbable 
performance 
the 
Michigan 

men’s 
basketball 
team put forth 
in its Big Ten 
Tournament 
opener. 
The 

eighth-seeded 
Wolverines 
dismantled 
Illinois, 75-55, and it felt like an 
underdog tale.

That win turned into a Big 

Ten Tournament championship, 
and this weekend, Michigan has 
a chance to punch its ticket to 
the Final Four for the first time 
since 2013.

“I think winning those four 

games in a row, against who we 
beat,” said Michigan coach John 
Beilein. “…I think that after that, 
these kids just said, ‘Hey, we go 
into this NCAA Tournament, we 
can play with anybody.’ After the 
gauntlet, they just ran.”

Despite being a No. 7 seed, the 

word “underdog” doesn’t quite 
fit anymore. The Wolverines are 
playing great basketball, and with 
each passing day, it has felt more 
like Michigan can make a run at 
the title.

But 
first 
comes 
Oregon. 

Thursday night, the Wolverines 
will tip off against the Ducks at 
the Sprint Center with a spot in 
the Elite Eight on the line, and 
Michigan’s experience in the 
opening weekend could prove 
invaluable.

When 
Michigan 
faced 

Oklahoma State and Louisville, 
those opponents were ranked first 

and seventh in adjusted offensive 
efficiency and adjusted defensive 
efficiency, respectively, according 
to Ken Pomeroy.

While 
the 
Ducks 
don’t 

necessarily fall into the elite tier 
of either category, they still rank 
in the top 25 for both.

“They can really put the ball 

in the basket, man, from a lot 
of different places,” said senior 
guard Derrick Walton Jr. “And 
they’re athletic. They got some 
athletic guys.

“…(Oregon 
is) 
like 
a 

combination of the last two teams, 
I think, but again, I think we fare 
well against a lot of different 
competition this year, so we’ll just 
see how this game plays out and 
make the proper adjustments.”

Though the Wolverines have 

showcased an ability to make 
those adjustments, they will still 
have their hands full. Finding 
a way to stop Oregon’s three-
headed monster of Dillon Brooks, 
Tyler Dorsey and Jordan Bell is 
no easy task.

Over the last five games, Brooks 

is averaging an impressive 18.8 
points while shooting 42 percent 
from the floor. Dorsey, on the 
other hand, has been playing on a 
whole new level. The sophomore 
guard is averaging 23.6 points on 
65-percent shooting through the 
last five contests.

In 
all 
likelihood, 
redshirt 

sophomore forward DJ Wilson 
and junior guard Muhammad-
Ali Abdur-Rahkman will match 
up with Brooks and Dorsey, 
respectively.

Though Wilson fared well 

against Wisconsin’s Ethan Happ 
and Nigel Hayes and Purdue’s 
Caleb Swanigan and Isaac Haas, 
Brooks is a different type of 
forward and could arguably be 
his biggest defensive challenge of 
the year.

The obstacles don’t end there, 

either.

The Ducks boast a plethora 

of talent outside of Brooks and 
Dorsey. Bell has shot nearly 63 
percent from the floor to this 
point, and in Oregon’s opening 
weekend, the junior forward 
cleaned up on the glass — grabbing 
24 boards through two games.

That’s not to say Oregon isn’t 

still vulnerable.

While the Ducks haven’t felt 

the impact of losing injured 
forward Chris Boucher through 
their 
first 
two 
games, 
the 

Wolverines may be able to tear 
that wound wide open.

Prior to Boucher’s ACL injury, 

Oregon allowed just 0.97 points 
per possession — good for first 
in the Pac-12. In the three games 
without Boucher, though, the 
Ducks are allowing 1.14 points per 
possession.

What’s more, Oregon has made 

a living from points off turnovers 
— averaging 15.8 points off 13.6 
takeaways. Michigan, on the 
other hand, leads the nation with 

just 9.2 turnovers per game, and 
has turned the ball over just 10 
times in the last two games.

“It’s not something that we 

just say, ‘OK, today we’re gonna 
take care of the ball,’ ” Beilein 
said. “It’s been like day one 
from the first summer practice 
that we’re valuing that. … It’s 
not like we got this elaborate 
press breaker.”

“It’s just the day-to-day things 

you do every day knowing that the 
way our system works. It’s about 
possessions.”

If the Wolverines can continue 

to take care of the ball, while 
also keeping pace with the 1.212 
points per possession they are 
averaging over the last three 
games, Michigan’s Dance could 
be far from over.

After all, when asked Tuesday 

if this team could make it to the 
Final Four, Wilson’s message 
was simple: “I mean, we can beat 
anybody, so I think so.”

Wolverines’ storybook postseason journey rolls into Kansas City this weekend

Chris Boucher leads Oregon, 

the best shot-blocking team in 
the country, with an average of 
2.5 blocks per game. 

But two weeks ago, the Ducks 

lost their 6-foot-10 forward to 
a season-ending ACL injury 
in the semifinals of the Pac-12 
Tournament, a big blow to the 
rotation of the Michigan men’s 
basketball 
team’s 
opponent 

Thursday.

To adjust to the absence of 

Boucher, Oregon coach Dana 
Altman shifted his star player, 
Pac-12 Player of the Year Dillon 
Brooks to the ‘4’ position, going 
with a smaller lineup to open 
the game.

While 
shot 
blocking 
is 

something 
Michigan 
has 

struggled 
with, 
evident 
in 

close games 
against 
Minnesota 
and 
Louisville 
— two top-
10 
shot-

blocking 
teams 
— 

Oregon’s 
small-ball 
lineup 
creates other problems for the 
Wolverines.

“They’re a very talented 

team,” said Michigan coach 
John 
Beilein. 
“I’ve 
been 

watching Dillon Brooks since 
he was playing with the Ontario 
teams earlier in his career.”

With 
Brooks 
starting 

off the game at the ‘4,’ he 
will be redshirt sophomore 
DJ 
Wilson’s 
defensive 

responsibility.

While Wilson will have the 

height advantage — Brooks is 
6-foot-7, Wilson is 6-foot-10 — 
Brooks shoots the ball at a 50.5 
percent clip while scoring 16.4 
points per game this season.

Wilson, though, says he’ll 

be ready, citing that he will go 
up against redshirt freshman 
guard Charles Matthews on the 
practice squad to prepare.

“I know Charles will imitate 

(Brooks) on the Scout team,” 
Wilson said. “I go against 
Charles all the time in practice. 
It’s nothing new to me.”

While 
Matthews 
is 
two 

inches shorter than Brooks, 
he possesses some of the same 
qualities in his shooting and 
passing ability, as well as his 
shifty ability to get to the rim.

With 
Brooks 
being 
a 

traditional ‘3,’ other Wolverines 
might have a chance to guard 
him as well, mainly senior 
forward 
Zak 
Irvin. 
Given 

Irvin’s defensive prowess in 
the last couple weeks, he’ll also 
be ready for the challenge.

“I feel like I’m able to 

guard anyone that I get put up 

against,” Irvin said, “Dillon 
Brooks is a great player, and 
I think DJ will be good to 
start off on him because of his 
length. DJ is so versatile as 
well, and he can guard a couple 
different positions too.”

But more than just the 

matchup between Brooks and 
Wilson, Oregon’s new offense 
has a certain familiarity factor 
for Michigan.

When 
junior 
forward 

Duncan Robinson is in the 
lineup at the ‘4,’ forming 
Michigan’s so-called “small-
ball lineup,” players have cited 
that going up against it in 
practice makes them feel more 
prepared 
for 
what 
Oregon 

brings to the table.

With Brooks at the ‘4,’ 

the Ducks will have just one 
traditional big man in the 

lineup 
— 

forward 
Jordan 
Bell 
will 

start 
while 

forward 
Kavell 
Bigby-
Willams will 
come 
off 

the 
bench 

— 
which 

creates 
matchup 
problems for 

most teams.

Michigan, though, given its 

affinity for the same type of 
lineup, says it is well-prepared.

“It’s a little bit easier,” Irvin 

said. “We’re used to playing 
small ball, and they play small 
ball, so I think it’ll be a good 
matchup for us.”

Beilein said Tuesday that the 

best preparation for a team is to 
play other similar teams.

Luckily for the Wolverines, 

Oregon 
looks 
to 
run 
in 

transition, much like Oklahoma 
State, and the Ducks have a lot 
of length — Bell is more than 
capable of guarding Michigan’s 
guards 
with 
his 
wingspan 

— 
much 
like 
Louisville’s 

frontcourt.

“Every game over the course 

of a season is practice for the 
next game, and that’s what 
we’ve had, two great practices,” 
Beilein said. “But so have they, 
so who responds the best, who 
makes their foul shots, who 
turns the ball over less and who 
gets the ball to bounce their 
way will determine this one.”

The Wolverines will go into 

Thursday’s matchup familiar 
with the type of game that 
Oregon likes to play.

But once the ball is tipped, 

the real test will be which team 
can adjust to what the other 
team brings.

SOFTBALL
SOFTBALL

‘M’ wins tune-up, 8-2

Senior right-hander Megan 

Betsa threw a nine-pitch, three-
strikeout inning. Junior right-
hander 
Tera 
Blanco hit 
a three-run 
homer and had a solid showing in 
the circle. The Michigan softball 
team scored eight runs on six hits. 
And the Wolverines are riding 
a five-game win streak — the 
longest of their season. 

All of the pieces are finally 

coming together, and just in time 
for conference play. According 
to coach Carol Hutchins, the 
team’s hard work has made the 
difference.

“We’ve had a lot of kids 

coming in extra in the last week,” 
Hutchins said. “Their desire to 
get better is what a coach wants 
to see, so we’re just working to get 
better. We’re a better team than 
we were a week ago.” 

In their fifth consecutive home 

win and final game prior to Big Ten 
play, the 19th-ranked Wolverines 
(19-7-1) made use of extra-base 
hits, toppling Eastern Michigan, 
8-2, Wednesday afternoon. 

Though Michigan and the 

Eagles (11-12) were close with 
six and five hits, respectively, 
the 
Wolverines 
consistently 

capitalized on runners in scoring 
position. 
Eastern 
Michigan’s 

offense failed to do the same, 
and woke up solely in the fourth 
inning.

After earning Big Ten Pitcher 

of the Week honors following a 
30-strikeout, one-hit weekend, 
Betsa took a break with Blanco 
starting in the circle for the 
second day in a row. Blanco set a 
commanding tone from the start, 
striking out the first Eagle batter 
who stepped up to the plate.

Michigan 
carried 
this 

intensity to the plate, wasting no 
time to get numbers on the board. 
From the leadoff spot, sophomore 
right fielder Natalie Peters hit a 
hard-bouncing blooper over third 
base that proved too much for the 
Eagles’ defense, resulting in an 
inside-the-park homer. Not only 

was this type of home run unique, 
but for the leadoff slap-hitter, it 
was the first of any kind in her 
collegiate career.

“Usually, since it was a blooper 

hit, I might be able to get two 
(bases),” Peters said. “And then I 
saw (the third baseman) missed 
it, so I kept going.”

The Wolverines would see 

an offensive awakening again 
in the third, with sophomore 
second baseman Faith Canfield 
and senior centerfielder Kelly 
Christner posting back-to-back 
RBI, widening the gap to 3-0.

With Canfield on second 

and Christner on first, Blanco 
drilled a bomb to the right-
field bleachers, her second of 
the season, to put Michigan 
ahead, 6-0.

But just as Blanco began to 

look poised at the plate, she saw 
a decline in consistency in the 
circle. With the first two Eastern 
Michigan batters on second and 
third in the fourth, the Eagles 
cranked an RBI single followed 
by a double steal, scoring the only 
two runs they would see all game. 
While Eastern Michigan had only 
one hit before that point, it added 
four hits to its count in the top of 
the fourth inning.

Despite Blanco’s performance 

in the fourth inning, Hutchins 
had nothing but praise for the 
right-hander’s overall showing in 
the game.

“I’m pleased,” Hutchins said. 

“I feel like Tera’s really settling 
into her role as a starting pitcher 
for us. She got out of that inning, 
and it didn’t seem to faze her.”

Betsa made an appearance 

in the circle for the last three 
innings and made sure to make 
it count. The ace saw one perfect 
inning, two 1-2-3 innings and six 
strikeouts, allowing no hits.

The final matchup before 

conference play showcased the 
best that Michigan softball has to 
offer: the ability to find power and 
timing at the plate, two confident 
starting pitchers and a lineup 
that best suits the Wolverines. If 
hard work and high-caliber game 
performance like this ensues, 
Michigan will be primed for 
success heading into Big Ten play.

Blanco starts second 
straight game in circle

It’s become routine. 
With 
both 
junior 
right-

hander Tera Blanco and senior 
right-hander 
Megan 
Betsa 

finding their grooves on the 
mound, the pitching rotation 
— in which the two pitchers 
alternate games — has become 
something of a formality.

The last time either pitcher 

started two straight games in 
the same series came back in 
the ACC/Big Ten Challenge last 
month 
against 

North 
Carolina 

State and Notre 
Dame, 
when 

Blanco 
started 

each of the final 
two 
games 
of 

the 
four-game 

tournament. 
Betsa has thrown 
more innings, 91.1 
to Blanco’s 80.2. 
But that disparity 
largely came in the early season, 
when Blanco was still adjusting 
to pitching regularly and often 
didn’t last as deep into games.

With a pitching schedule that 

rigid, it becomes noteworthy 
when Michigan coach Carol 
Hutchins decides to stray from 
the norm. 

Wednesday was such a day.
A day after starting against 

Bowling Green, Blanco, not 
Betsa, trotted out to the circle 
in the top of the first inning 
against Eastern Michigan. 

With back-to-back games 

against 
two 
Mid-American 

Conference foes and Betsa 
having 
some 
minor 
back 

tightness, Hutchins identified 
an opportunity to give Blanco 
more innings. Pitching Blanco 
in each game, she believed, 
would be mutually beneficial 
for Blanco, the team and Betsa. 

“Megan’s back kind of acted up 

over the weekend a little bit. She 
was tight yesterday. Certainly, 
pitching in the cold is tough … 
we were a little concerned with 

that,” Hutchins said. “It’s good 
for Tera to have to carry the load. 
It’s good for Tera to have to pitch 
two days in a row.”

From Blanco’s standpoint, 

the decision makes logical 
sense. As she continues to 
become acquainted with her 
role as the second starter — a 
new role for her in 2017 — more 
innings and more reps become 
valuable commodities. 

Blanco has already proven 

more reliable of late, becoming 
a more efficient pitcher. Since 
Feb. 26, Blanco has posted a 

2.03 
earned-

run 
average 

with 
a 
7.14 

strikeout-to-
walk ratio in 
over 40 innings 
pitched, 
compared to a 
2.73 ERA and 
1.3 
strikeout-

to-walk 
ratio 
before. 

With 
the 

conference season beginning 
this weekend against Penn 
State, Blanco finding her form 
to complement Betsa has been 
a positive development for the 
Wolverines’ pitching staff.

Perhaps, though, the decision 

to start Blanco says more about 
how the team feels about 
Betsa going forward. Betsa has 
thrown over 200 innings each 
of the last two seasons and 
seems on pace to do the same in 
2017. Since Betsa has dealt with 
lingering injuries in previous 
seasons, Hutchins has been 
open about needing to keep her 
healthy throughout the length 
of the season. While back 
stiffness tends to be relatively 
minor, Hutchins deemed it not 
worthy of risking, given the 
environment and opponent.

Saving four innings in a 

March game may sound trivial in 
the grand scheme of the season.

What may seem trivial now, 

though, could loom large if it 
ensures a healthy Megan Betsa 
in May.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Sibel Ozer’s smile is warm 

and genuine, conveying a calm, 
collected kindness that belies some 
of the darker experiences she’s had 
over the course of her 15-year-long 
journey with art therapy.

At a hefty 7.4 on the Richter 

scale, 
Turkey’s 
1999 
Izmit 

earthquake claimed thousands of 
lives and left even more injured, 
along with destroying several 
hundred thousand properties and 
buildings. Ozer, who had worked 
as a clinical psychologist in Izmit 
prior to the quake, had her first 
experience with art therapy when 
a group of Israeli volunteers, one of 
whom was an art therapist, came 
to help train local therapists in 
trauma intervention methods.

“We 
don’t 
have 
master’s 

programs (for art therapy) in 
Turkey, so the work she did with 
us was definitely very intriguing,” 
Ozer, 
a 
board-certified 
art 

therapist and a licensed, certified 
professional counselor, said. “She 
worked to support us as we went 
into the field, so that we weren’t 
traumatized ourselves, but also 
showing some of the work the 
children would do, how to look at 
the art, how not to interpret.”

In 2000, Ozer and her family 

moved from Istanbul to the United 
States, but it wasn’t until several 
years afterward that she decided 
to go back to school to pursue 
art therapy instead of repeating 
clinical psychology schooling. Art 
therapy is much more prevalent in 
the United States than it is in most 
countries. It calls the American 
Art 
Therapy 
Association 
and 

several major art therapy journals 
home, but it’s also a licensed and 
regulated profession in the United 
States, with master’s programs 
available and specific steps that 
must be undertaken in order to 
become credentialed and board 
certified.

The process is not one to be 

taken lightly. Apart from receiving 
a master’s degree and partaking 
in 
supervised 
internships, 

students are required to complete 
at least “1,000 hours of direct 
client contact” to even apply for 
certification. The AATA site has 
a 
page 
specifically 
dedicated 

to 
helping 
people 
determine 

whether someone is a qualified art 
therapist.

Ozer though has experienced 

art therapy beyond her role as 
a therapist. In October, she was 
diagnosed with Stage 1 breast 
cancer, which set about a rapid 
progression of appointments, and, 
eventually, surgery. Throughout 
the process, she relied on art 
therapy as both a source of insight 
and self-care. Today, she is cancer-
free.

“One of the things when you 

become a patient is that suddenly 
you’re diagnosed and you have no 
choice in what has to unfold — I 
think the definition of a patient is 
that things are done to you — and 
so being able to exercise choice and 

agency and bringing myself into a 
position of doing was really helpful 
in undoing some of the effects of 
that choicelessness,” Ozer said.

Ozer 
doesn’t 
necessarily 

consider herself an artist, even 
though art is so central to what 
she does. In the field, art therapists 
tend to come from one of two paths: 
an art background or a psychology 
background. The difference may 
be hard to distinguish at first, but 
makes sense once it’s more closely 
observed. Art, in itself, has its 
own structured techniques, rich 
history and movements, and the 
approach of an artist is likely to be 
drastically different compared to 
that of a psychologist.

“I’m always more looking from 

the lens of a psychotherapist; it 
was after I’d gotten my degree that 
I really started to develop my artist 
self” Ozer said. “And to this day I 
really don’t consider myself an 
artist but more an art therapist.”

Linda Adamcz, a Kalamazoo-

based 
counselor 
and 
mental-

health therapist who uses music 
and art therapy in in her practice, 
also emphasizes the distinction 
between 
structured 
art 
and 

art therapy, though she is not a 
licensed art therapist. For many, 
it can be difficult to fully embrace 
free flow painting and let go of the 
idea that art has to be perfect or 
have a specific technique.

“Sometimes people have a hard 

time not letting themselves have 
an agenda or plan and be open to 
receiving intuition and trusting 
themselves,” Adamcz said.

During 
her 
14 
years 
of 

experience working in a traditional 
mental-health setting, Adamcz saw 
patients experiencing blocks while 
talking about issues. She was first 
introduced to working with art 
through integrative breathwork 
training, which involved utilizing 
breathing techniques and music, 
then 
creating 
art 
afterward. 

Adamcz has a master’s of social 
work, is a certified practitioner 
of Integrative Breathwork and 
Psychospiritual Integration, and 
has been working in the mental-
health field for more than 28 years.

Unlike other forms of cognition-

based therapy, art therapy utilizes 
the 
emotional, 
creative 
right 

hemisphere of the brain instead of 
the analytical left.

“Sometimes, when emotions 

are stuck deep inside the body, 
both music and art are helpful,” 
Adamcz said. “With children, for 
example, who can’t necessarily 
verbalize 
trauma, 
nonverbal 

types of therapy are a good way to 
express that.”

Adamcz looks to art for deeper 

personal 
spiritual 
fulfillment 

and guidance, but emphasizes 
that while art therapy can indeed 
be very powerful, it should be 
considered an alternative to more 
mainstream forms of therapy, 
not necessarily a replacement, 
especially if someone is completely 
closed to the merits of art therapy.

“If you’ve got the mindset that 

there’s no value in it — you need to 
have at least a little bit of openness 
to it,” Adamcz said. “I’d suggest 

Creative healing: the restorative 
power of art, music and drama

In the face of negative stigmas and a lack of mainstream exposure traditional means of 
therapy grounded in art pose themselves as meritable means of approaching mental health

more authoritarian culture, an art 
therapist might be more directive 
in how they offer knowledge.

“What I’m saying is just a 

general statement,” Ozer said. 
“Given a situation with the right 
person, I might choose to be 
directive because that might be 
what that situation demands. It’s 
very flexible.”

—

Today, the biggest obstacle to 

art therapy’s proliferation is not 
the negative stigma around the 
profession, but rather its lack of 
widespread exposure. For the 
most part, people don’t know 
what it is or what it does.

“If there’s only one position 

for somebody in the helping 
field, it’s going to start with a 
social worker,” Ozer said. “To be 
hired purely with an art therapy 
degree continues to be a challenge 
around the U.S.”

And the difficulties also apply 

to other non-traditional forms 
of therapy, like drama therapy, 
which aims to accomplish the 
same goals as art therapy, but 
utilizing a different medium. 
According to the North American 
Drama 
Therapy 
Association, 

drama therapy “is the intentional 
use of drama and/or theater 
processes to achieve therapeutic 
goals.”

Like 
art 
therapy, 
drama 

therapy isn’t necessarily about 
creating a flawless product to be 
consumed by an audience. These 
“drama and theater processes” 
take the form of “storytelling, 
projective 
play, 
purposeful 

improvisation, and performance,” 
which help participants “rehearse 
desired behaviors, practice being 
in relationship, expand and find 
flexibility between life roles, and 
perform the change they wish to 
be and see in the world.”

For Kristi Davis, a registered 

drama therapist, one of the 
hardest parts of practicing drama 
therapy is convincing people that 
they don’t actually have to be 
partaking in a stage performance 
in order to participate.

“You’re not trying to be an 

actor, you’re just being real,” 
Davis said. “You’re not trying 
to act like you’re auditioning. It 
sounds scary, I think, to a lot of 
people. Art sounds easier, music 
sounds easier, but drama therapy 
sounds scarier.”

Drama therapy differs from 

art therapy in that it is an 
embodiment technique; clients 
will use their entire bodies 
as a part of the process. With 
talk 
therapy 
alone, 
defense 

mechanisms might unconsciously 
prevent someone from reaching 
repressed emotions, but through 
drama therapy, new information 
can rise to the surface, bypassing 
blocks that may have been in place 
for years or even a lifetime.

“That’s like when people see 

things in their art that come out 
that were unconscious — same 
with the drama, the unconscious 
things that were suppressed come 
out and it’s just really amazing to 
see,” Davis said.

Drama therapy relies heavily on 

imagination and the connection 
between thoughts and physical 
symptoms. For example, someone 
in a profoundly stressful situation 
might have trouble sleeping or 
could suffer from headaches.

“With 
anxiety 
and 
worry, 

you’re thinking about something 
bad that could happen, but your 
body is experiencing it as if it were 
real,” Davis said.

The distinction from traditional 

forms of therapy is that drama 
therapy can use this connection to 
help people change for the better. 
Sometimes, physically acting out 
a positive outcome can be more 
permanent and powerful than 
simply imagining it.

“You 
could 
imagine 
good 

things happening, how you want 
things to be and start acting 
that way,” Davis said. “(Drama 
therapy) gives you a viscerally 
real experience; it’s super healing 
and helpful, almost like you’re 
developing new neural networks 
in the act of pretending and 
imagining.”

This technique is especially 

useful 
for 
interactions 
that 

might no longer be possible. For 
example, if a client recently had 
a loved one pass away, but they 
still had unresolved issues with 
the deceased, a drama therapist 
might roleplay the situation by 
reversing positions back and forth 
until the patient feels at peace. In 
addition, role reversal can help 
with conflict resolution, or to help 
someone practice their verbal 
skills during a difficult situation.

“Role reversal is a favorite 

technique, because it’s really like 
you’re stepping into someone 
else’s shoes,” Davis said. “When 
you become them and say what 
you think they would say, and you 
start to feel their perspective, it’s 
easier to understand and accept.”

Such understanding is more 

important than ever in the midst 
of the current polarizing political 
climate.

“It’s a great way to facilitate 

understanding and know how to 
have a positive, helpful discussion 
with them,” Davis said. “It 
helps a lot with forgiveness too, 
especially now, with political 
forgiveness.”

Drama therapy can also be 

used artistically, in the form of 
transformational theater. If a 
client chooses to, they can work 
with a drama therapist, take an 
issue they’ve struggled with and 
create an actual theater piece out 
of the issue. During the creation 
of the piece, the client would 
have some sort of transformation 
take place and theatrically show 
how the change develops. The 
finished production might have 
the creator as the only performer, 
or it might star a complete cast, 
and depending on the producer’s 
wishes, it might only be performed 
for a private audience or a larger 
group of public viewers.

“That becomes a real artistic 

endeavor,” Davis said. “You’re 
doing it for yourself first, to heal 
whatever your issue is, but then 
you’re taking it to the next step, 
and then you’re giving it away so 
that it also benefits other people, 
because a lot of people are helped 
by seeing someone else transform 
something 
they’re 
struggling 

with.”

An important aspect of drama 

therapy is that it’s usually done 
in groups, which can create a 
fun and exciting atmosphere 
(something that usually isn’t 
associated with therapy) and 
facilitate group bonding.

“There’s tremendous power 

in the group working together to 
help each other — a lot of people 
would recognize that if the had 
been in a musical, you end up 
developing a bond with your 
fellow actors,” Davis said.

In 
the 
end, 
it’s 
the 

unconventional nature of drama 
therapy that makes it stand out.

“Being able to use your body 

and sound that isn’t language, 
per se, gives you another way to 
express what you’re feeling, just 
like art and artwork,” Davis said. 
“Therapy can be scary, and if you 
can approach it in a different way 
using the arts, it gives you more 
tools.”

Non-traditional 
forms 
of 

therapy 
are 
still 
a 
largely 

untapped source of healing. It 
is only with increased public 
awareness, education and time 
that artistic therapies can reach 
broader populations, and perhaps 
even help people all over the 
world.

they give it a try and see what it’s 
like.”

Ozer 
agreed, 
citing 
the 

complexities that make up the 
human consciousness.

“We’re highly mental beings, 

but we’re simultaneously deeply 
emotional, 
completely 
illogical 

and spiritual beings as well,” Ozer 
said. “And sometimes those deeper 
parts of ourselves really know 
what we need more than we are 
able to figure it out with our minds 
— art sort of bypasses all the noise 
and goes right to where some of 
the wisdom is.”

There’s no limit to who can 

use art therapy; basically, anyone 
who wants to engage with it can. 
It can be used for a variety of 
demographics and settings, from 
a traditional client and therapist 
setting to more trauma-based 
therapy, like with those affected 
by the Izmit earthquake.

“Any population that you can 

think 
of 
that 

needs 
help, 
it 

can bring things 
that the verbal 
modality 
just 

doesn’t 
have,” 

Ozer said. “So, I 
would think of it 
as a wonderful, 
necessary 
adjunct, 
additional, 
not 

something 
to 

replace 
… 
it’s 

a 
wonderful, 

additional, 
enriching 
addition to the 
general field of 
psychotherapy.”

When 
Ozer 

talks about art therapy, she breaks 
it down into three main parts: 
the materials, the process itself 
and the product. Materials can 
include pencils and finger paints, 
one offering a lot of control and 
the other offering much less 
control; the abundance of different 
material qualities available allow 
an entire, multifaceted spectrum 
of expression. Ozer believes that 
the specific materials a person 
chooses in art therapy are an 
important 
window 
into 
their 

deeper thoughts, pointing to the 
concept of isomorphism.

“So what isomorphism means is 

that what ends up happening with 
your hands here in the art, very 
often, but not always — sometimes 
the cigar is just a cigar, not a 
symbol,” Ozer said. “It’s connected 
to what’s going on inside of us 
both internally and psychically; 
when you have an abundance of 
materials and you let the person 
choose, there’s information there 
with regards to what might be 
going on.”

Sometimes, isomorphic patterns 

are easier to recognize after the 
artistic moment has passed. Back 
when Ozer was completing her 
internship at a hospice center in 
Denver, she took up wood burning. 
Before, 
her 
primary 
medium 

was painting, and it wasn’t until 
looking back that she realized the 
connection between the material 

and her surroundings at the time.

“It occurred to me that it 

captured the experience of death 
so much better than painting 
because in painting there’s this 
possibility to do, undo, change 
and shift, bringing things back, 
whereas once you burn into the 
wood, that dent — you will not be 
able to get that wood back,” Ozer 
said. “That wood is gone for good 
and the mark is permanent.”

Art 
therapy 
highlights 

sublimation, 
which 
is 
the 

conversion 
of 
unacceptable 

emotions 
or 
ideas 
into 

constructive, 
more 
socially 

acceptable forms. Instead of acting 
upon angry or even destructive 
thoughts, art therapy provides an 
outlet for a person to undergo a 
full, transformative response to a 
problem; after creating, the pent-
up feelings usually disappear.

Art therapists might differ on 

how they approach a finished 

product, 
depending 
on 

what 
school 
of 

thought they come 
from. A classically 
Freudian therapist 
might tend toward 
a more intellectual 
interpretation 
according to their 
knowledge 
of 

symbology, while 
a more Gestalt-
oriented therapist 
might work more 
collaboratively 
with 
a 
client 

to 
uncover 

information.

“The way I was 

educated, I’d never 

interpret based on what I think I 
know, because that’s bound to 
include more of my projections,” 
Ozer said. “So I would go about 
interpreting through a lot of 
asking 
of 
questions, 
getting 

ultimately to where we’re going 
through what you see, what you 
feel, what your association are.” 

Differences arise because of 

culture, too. The United States’ 
heavily 
individualistic 
society 

tends to result in a much more 
client centered approach, but in a

“Make 
an 
installation, 

illicit emotion, and make it 
overwhelming” — these were 
the instructions given to Art 
& Design Sophomore, Perry 
Stella, for the second part of 
a project in one of her studio 
courses this year. For part one, 
Stella focused on the issues of 
memory and storytelling, while 
the second part was meant to 
represent an obstruction to 
those narratives. Though this 
might seem a challengingly 
broad starting point to some, 
for Stella, her subject was 
clear.

“Dissociative 
disorders, 

which can lend itself to social 
anxiety, is kind of like having 
the feeling that you’re not 
inside your own body, or that 
you’re watching experiences 
but you feel like you can’t really 
interact with the world around 
you” Stella said, describing her 
personal obstacles.

Stella, who has worked in a 

variety of mediums, has most 
recently focused on fiber work 
and 
installations. 
For 
this 

particular 
assignment, 
the 

project she ultimately created, 
called “Shelter,” is a 3D audio 
installation, wherein a four-
by-four foot cube is lined 
inside with dark black faux fur. 
On the inside, a composition 
of old voicemails Stella had 
collected and compiled played 
on repeat, growing louder and 
louder over a fifteen-minute 

interval.

“The voicemails are meant 

to 
represent 
all 
of 
your 

responsibilities; 
no 
matter 

how mundane they are, you 
can’t interact with them to 
actually take care of anything,” 
Stella said of the recordings’ 
significance. 
The 
sound 

ultimately became so loud 
that audiences were unable to 
understand the words.

Stella did not shy away 

from using her own coping 
mechanisms as a feature in the 
piece.

“The fur lining is actually 

something 
that 
I’ve 
been 

taught when I get into that 
out of body state — to find 
something very textural and 
hang on to it and feel it so you 
can ground yourself in your 
own body,” Stella continued.

The idea of sharing her 

experiences 
and 
exposing 

this 
kind 
of 
vulnerability 

to strangers at first seemed 
daunting. 
Stella 
further 

struggled with avoiding the 
frequently exhibited motif of 
the “tortured artist,” while 
honestly 
reflecting 
on 
the 

reality of her own mental 
health. However, she soon 
realized the importance of 
sharing such experiences in 
this visual way — it is accessible 
to all.

“At first I thought maybe I 

should water down the idea so I 
don’t have to talk about certain 
things, but I decided not to,” 
Stella said. “I was thinking 
about how art reflects how 
you experience the world, and 

how this dissociative disorder 
majorly affects how I perceive 
the world; it sometimes even 
takes me out of my own body, 
so how could I really ignore 
that?”

Her piece was shown along 

with the rest of her class in 
their studio (seeing as Stella’s 
box can hardly fit outside of 
the door), with an expectedly 
responsive 
and 
engaging 

audience. Many approached 
Stella to ask further questions 
about her experiences and to 
clarify their understandings 
of dissociative disorders and 
their effects. There were some 
ironically 
fitting 
surprises, 

too.

“I noticed something people 

really liked to do was bang on 
the outside of the box or try 
to get in at the same time that 
another person was in there,” 
Stella said. “So those were 
things that I didn’t expect 
but ended up really lending 
themselves to the project.” 
Others left with chills.

Stella was given an honorable 

mention for the 2017 Science 
as 
Art 
Contest 
exhibition 

this year and further plans 
on 
expanding 
“Shelter” 
to 

include a video documentation 
of the work with additional 
information about dissociative 
disorders.

“Mental disorders are so 

common even on campus, and 
that’s not talked about enough,” 
Stella said. “That really needs 
to be overcome, and through 
art and media, these things can 
be normalized.”

On and Off the Yoga Mat:
Mindfulness at aUM

A rapidly growing number of 

students can be spotted toting 
yoga mats around campus on their 
way to one of the many studios 
that subsist in Ann Arbor. The city 
has over 37 Ashtanga Vinyasa (a 
variety of yoga that synchronizes 
breath and movement through a 
set series of poses based on the 
Ashtanga series) studios alone, 
which represent a small sliver 
of the mecca that the state of 
Michigan serves as for those that 
practice yoga. aUM is among the 
newest — and some might say 
more unconventional — of these 
studios, but has grown immensely 
since its opening in 2013.

It was in September of 2013 

that owner and University of 
Michigan alum Jessie Lipkowitz 
heard herself say the words, “I 
want to open up a yoga studio” 
aloud, before opening what she 
called “baby aUM” in an 800 
square-foot basement to only six 
customers. Since then, aUM — a 
play on the Sanskrit word “om” 
and the studio’s location — has 
moved into a 7,000 square-foot 
space on South University Avenue 
with over 60 regular clients, most 
of which are students.

When I first walked into 

aUM Yoga Studio, I was made 
immediately aware that I was 
entering a unique space. A sign 
in the doorway asks clients to 
take off their shoes, physically 
inoculating the space against the 
outside world. That was back in 
January, when upon returning 
from winter break, I turned to 
aUM in an effort to manage the 
stress that I had felt building 
inside me for months.

My 
initial 
experience, 

however, wasn’t the meditative 
austerity I’d expected. It was far 
more casual. The bright tones 
and weathered wooden decor 
of the interior buzzed with a 
similar energy to that of students 
filing into class. Though students 
are reminded to maintain a 
“sacred silence” prior to and 
during class, gentle murmurs 
permeated the cozy room before 
the instructor greeted everyone 
warmly. Samantha Lincoln, an 
LSA senior and student of aUM 
Yoga’s Demystify Yoga Teacher 
Training 
program, 
described 

aUM as “different from a lot of 
other yoga studios” that she’s 
been to, “It’s a really great 
(environment). Everyone is so 
friendly and welcoming.”

Before being thrust into a series 

of flows and positions I could 
barely maintain, I felt at ease; all 
while being reminded to consider 
my 
breathing 
(something 
I 

had abandoned early on in my 
efforts to contort my body). I was 
surprised by the challenge, and 
I left the class with a feeling like 
nothing I’d experienced before.

“You feel lighter,” said Lincoln, 

who in her third month of 
training, is becoming increasingly 
familiar with the physical and 
mental benefits of the practice.

Yoga teaches non-reactivity, a 

principle that aUM emphasizes 
both in its teacher training 
program and regular classes.

“When 
you’re 
doing 
this 

physical 
practice, 
the 
whole 

idea is that you need to be able 
to take it off the mat … whatever 
life throws at you, you want to be 
calm and rational in the face of it,” 
explained Lincoln.

Lipkowitz also described non-

reactivity:

“It’s being able to have an event 

happen and have completely no 
emotions towards that event until 
you can actually analyze it and 
immediately not react to it, and I 
think that’s a huge part of taking 
yoga off the mat and just being a 
calmer, less reactive person.”

She also added that this 

concept translates to greater 
mindfulness and self awareness, 
in turn allowing students to be 
kinder and more compassionate 
to themselves and to others. These 
mechanisms for coping with the 
pressures of life — whether trivial 
or major — on a regular basis are 
part of what makes the practice 
so unique. Though, Lipkowitz 
also added that she’s experienced 
similar benefits from other forms 
of physical exercise, such as 
running.

“I think yoga relies on the 

assumption 
that 
the 
human 

condition is that of suffering. 
Everyone is suffering and we all 
walk these different paths where 
there’s trifles and adversity … we 
all as human beings have to cope 
with a lot, and all of our coping 
mechanisms are different,” said 
Lipkowitz.

But she believes that non-

reactivity is part of what helps 
students cope with adversities, 
be 
it 
mental 
or 
otherwise. 

Every semester, aUM offers two 
scholarships for student packages. 
Over 
one 
hundred 
students 

submit 
applications, 
detailing 

their individual motivations for 
attending classes aUM. Many cite 
anxiety, depression and stress 
as their primary reasons for 
practicing yoga.

Lipkowitz trained at Center 

for Yoga and previously RussaYog 
(now permanently closed), which 
helped her envision the kind of 
studio where she would build her 
practice.

“Thinking 
back 
to 
my 

experience as an undergraduate 
— what would have gotten me to 
go to yoga — the first answer that 
came to mind was something that 
was a little bit less intimidating 
and a little more fun … but then 
the second thing that came to 
mind 
was 
community,” 
said 

Lipkowitz of her philosophy.

Lipkowitz 
was 
interested 

in targeting people who didn’t 
already practice yoga. At aUM, 
classes aren’t separated by level of 
intensity. Talking about her early 
experiences in yoga, Lopkowitz 
said:

“I think it’s really easy in yoga, 

and in any fitness studio that you 
go to, to feel like an outsider … I 
think aUM was really successful 
in creating a market for new 
people to explore and try yoga.”

However, it isn’t always easy to 

get people to try yoga for the first 
time, or to even stick with the 
practice once they try it.

“Talking about bodies or doing 

weird things with bodies is taboo. 
Even getting people to come in 
and trying to get them to connect 
with the breath is really difficult,” 
said Lipkowitz. “I think a lot of 
people who come in here don’t 
really get this yoga thing starting 
out, but they still connect with it 
because it’s a physical practice.”

For some, like Lipkowitz, the 

mind-body connection doesn’t 
come right away: “It took me 
years to find that connection,” 
she said. “But once you find that 
connection between breath and 
movement, I think that that’s 
really the power in yoga.”

Lincoln echoed this sentiment, 

saying: “You get this connection 
doing things that are physical and 
mental. I think at aUM they keep 
it very centered on mindfulness.”

Achieving mindfulness can 

become difficult when entering 
college, especially at a highly 
competitive 
school 
like 
the 

University of Michigan.

“I think it’s very much the 

culture here to do as much as 
possible, to be as successful 
as possible, to compete with 
everyone,” 
said 
Lincoln. 

“And at its core, yoga is a very 
noncompetitive thing.”

Though 
finding 
this 

connection is challenging for 
most, both Lincoln and Lipkowitz 
stated that the hour of time spent 
dedicated to self-care is a boon to 
mental and physical health in an 
environment where it isn’t always 
prioritized. Lipkowitz recalled 
that her time spent on fitness 
was edged out by her academic 
priorities when she was a student 
at 
the 
University. 
Similarly, 

Lincoln reflected on her time here, 
stating that she felt like there are 
never days off. However, at aUM, 
“It’s very much just about your 
body and what you can do. The 
classes are a very noncompetitive 
environment,” Lincoln said. “And 
you’re just taking time to take 
care of yourself and to just focus 
in on your thoughts.”

What aUM teaches students to 

take off the mat can’t be taught 
in an academic classroom, stated 
Lincoln.

“It’s not something you learn 

in school,” she remarked, “Even 
beyond what I could do to be 
successful or well-liked, do I like 
myself? Am I doing things that 
are making the world a better 
place? Am I at peace with who I 
am?”

While it may take years for 

some to find the answers to these 
questions, and while it may not 
necessarily be through practicing 
yoga, aUM offers a sanctuary for 
students to go to and ruminate on 
their own personal well-being.

As 
Lipkowitz 
previously 

stated, yoga offers methods of 
coping with some issues; though, 
it’s a personal path, and one that 
may be limited in what it offers to 
some more than others.

“I’m not going to say yoga 

cured any of my mental health 
issues,” said Lincoln. “I think it 
does help with body image a lot. 
There are kind of two sides to 
that. You start to be proud of what 
your body can do, rather than 
what it looks like. Also, you learn 
to forgive it for things.”

Lincoln continued, “It’s not 

like you do one yoga class and go, 
‘Oh that cured my depression.’ 
I think if you’re doing it enough 
and focusing enough on your 
breathing and bringing that to 
other situations it kind of seeps 
out into the rest of your life.”

There 
is 
often 
a 
taboo 

associated with mental health. 
Lipkowitz 
acknowledged 
this 

stigma, saying:

“You generally don’t talk about 

those things,” but that at aUM, 
“people are much more open and 
honest about how they’re feeling 
and just their general human 
experience more so than other 
fitness places or other businesses 
or other communities.”

Lipkowitz stressed that it’s the 

culture at aUM that she hopes will 
continue to empower people to be 
compassionate by connecting not 
only their bodies and minds, but 
also with others.

Not Insane: A study of the 
complex ‘Legion’ ’s David

FX

David in FX’s ‘Legion’

Analyzing the intracacies of a television character as it 
relates to mental illness and its repetitive media treatment

Sitting down to speak with 

Mentality Magazine, I was 
sucked into a space where 
honesty 
was 
encouraged, 

where mental health and art 
were intertwined and where 
speaking up was and always 
will be the answer.

The student-run publication 

made its first appearance at 
the University at Festifall this 
past semester. After years of 
not having an organization 
dedicated to freely writing and 
publishing 
work 
exclusively 

about mental health, Mentality 
Magazine filled the space.

“If you think it’s important 

to write about, put it out 
there,” said Anna Learis, an 
Engineering sophomore and 
senior editor of the magazine.

With a once a semester 

print 
publication, 
weekly 

meetings 
and 
a 
constant 

stream of website posts, the 
group produces content with 
individual styles and twists. 
Every writer contributes his/
her own perspective on mental 
health, highlighting how it 
affects everyone differently. 
This originality in their work 
also reflects the individuality 
of mental illnesses, according 
to Liz Fernandez, an LSA 
freshman 
and 
writer 
for 

Mentality.

“Stories weave themselves 

naturally because they are real 
people’s emotions,” Fernandez 
said. “You don’t fabricate it. 
Those stories and emotions 
themselves 
are 
inherently 

motivating.”

Learis 
and 
Fernandez 

explained the different types 
of articles that the magazine 
publishes. Producing columns 
— like “Speak Out Sundays,” 
which connects mental health 
and celebrities — allows the 
writers to talk about mental 
health through other artists 
and art mediums. Additionally, 
the 
writers 
do 
“Mid-Week 

Music” playlists, where they 
compile songs that reflect how 
they are feeling that week.

The women also described 

how the articles serve as 
opportunities to discuss how 

the outside world may or may 
not fully understand the extent 
to which people suffer from 
mental illness. Some of the 
articles display the negative 
stigmas of mental illness in 
media, review mental practices 
like 
meditation 
and 
even 

discuss the importance of the 
simple, but helpful sun lamp.

Learis also explained that 

the 
pieces 
propose 
little, 

“gimmicky 
mental 
health 

things,” providing ideas as 
to how people can cope with 
mental health.

However, it is important to 

note that Mentality Magazine 
is not solely a group of people 
who have mental health related 
issues and are writing about it. 
The group strives to shine light 
on mental health and to profile 
the importance of awareness, 
especially 
on 
a 
college 

campus, but does not restrict 
its staff only to those who are 
personally affected.

“Our primary goal as a 

magazine 
is 
to 
foster 
the 

conversation 
about 
(mental 

health),” Learis said. “Our view 
is that, by sharing our stories, 
we want people to feel less 
alone.”

In order to create such a 

distinct and serious publication, 
Learis really thought about her 
personal life and how mental 
health has affected her.

“In high school we had to 

read Walt Whitman’s ‘Song 
of Myself’,” she said. It was 
here where she realized she 
can “write bluntly, but still 
artistically” about the things 
that mattered most to her –– 
the recognition and severity 
that is mental health.

“It doesn’t have to be black 

and white … you don’t have to 
sugarcoat things,” she added. 
With these conditions in mind, 
Learis 
was 
determined 
to 

design a space for mental health 
and to bring forth the concept 
that the it is more common than 
many believe.

And as one of the first student-

run, mental health publications 
on college campuses across the 
country — and the only one at 
the University — Mentality 
Magazine 
has 
a 
duty 
to 

perform.

“There is a power in writing, 

both reading it and doing it 

yourself,” 
Fernandez 
said 

when explaining the difference 
between 
reading 
someone’s 

story versus just hearing it.

The 
magazine 
staff 

continues to share their stories 
and perspectives not only with 
the public, but closely with one 
another. As a tight-knit group, 
organization members spends 
time outside of work, like 
hanging out at Sweetwaters 
and holding pot lucks. They 
openly talk about how their 
mental health affects each of 
them on a daily basis.

“I 
had 
a 
really 
hard 

time 
adjusting 
to 
college,” 

Fernandez explained. “I was so 
sad in a place where everyone 
is so excited,” and she did not 
quite understand why.

Encouraging 
that 

conversation, 
the 
group 

lingered on Fernandez’s phrase 
about feeling lonely at a new 
place like the University, not 
letting it slip into the shadows 
like so many mental health 
topics usually do. They are the 
type of people expanding on 
the question: Why isn’t this 
something people talk more 
about?

“People are looking for a 

community to sit and talk, and 
that is OK,” Learis added.

These hangouts are not like 

typical therapy sessions –– 
ones that can be intimidating 
or 
scary 
when 
expressing 

one’s mental health problems. 
They’re a group of trustworthy 
friends who understand that 
there is no need to hold back 
about the issues at hand.

“(Mentality 
Magazine) 

creates 
a 
culture 
where 

people can talk about it and be 
comfortable … I immediately 
felt connected to these people,” 
Fernandez said.

The beauty of the magazine 

is that anyone can submit pieces 
to it, not just MM writers or 
University Michigan students.

Learis said she frequently 

recieves emails from readers 
stating that they appreciate 
Mentality, and also want to 
contribute to the conversation.

“I would (write an article) 

1,000 times over if it means 
making one person feel better 
about their condition or about 
how they are feeling on any 
given day.”

AMELIA CACCHIONE/THE MICHIGAN DAILY

Mentality Magazine looks 
to serve as trailblazer for 
mental-health writing

The issue of mental illness 

has been at the forefront of 
television for a while now. 
Acclaimed shows like FX’s 
“You’re The Worst,” the CW’s 
“Crazy 
Ex-Girlfriend” 
and 

Netflix’s “Unbreakable Kimmy 
Schmidt” have been praised 
for their sensitive, nuanced 
portrayals of mental health. 
And while its exposure into 
mainstream TV has helped 
emphasize its social relevance, 
mental illness is still a very 
tricky, often perplexing topic 
to depict.

Using mental illness in TV 

delicately and acutely requires 
several necessary steps: doing 
extensive 
research, 
getting 

advice from mental health 
consultants, 
hiring 
writers 

with 
familiarity 
or 
lived-

in 
experiences 
of 
mental 

illness and getting actors who 
approach the material in a 
thoughtful way. But it’s possible 
for a show that successfully 
discusses mental illness to also 
simply use creative storytelling 
to immerse the audience into 
understanding mental illness 
on a personal, cultural and 
institutional level.

FX’s “Legion” is one such 

show that puts that tactic to 
the test. 

Created by Noah Hawley 

(“Fargo”) and based on a 
character of the same name 
from 
the 
“X-Men” 
comics, 

“Legion” is one of the most 
unusual and refreshing TV 
programs in recent memory. 
It works as both a superhero 
drama 
and 
psychological 

thriller, 
incorporating 

arresting visuals, innovative 
cinematography and a haunting 
electronic music score. Though 
“Legion” remains steadfast in 
joining the canon of peak TV — 
it was just renewed for a second 
season 
— 
the 
authenticity 

of its perspective on mental 
illness has become somewhat 
debatable.

“Legion” 
follows 
David 

Haller (Dan Stevens, “Beauty 
and the Beast”), a powerful 
mutant 
who 
is 
diagnosed 

with schizophrenia at a young 
age but later discovers that 
his “illness” is actually just 
telekinetic powers. After he’s 
recruited by a team of mutants, 
David learns to harness his 
abilities, leading him on a 
journey of self-discovery of 
differentiating between reality 
and fantasy.

Given its jarring visual style 

and unconventional, non-linear 

narrative, 
“Legion” 
walks 

a thin line between making 
mental illness into a spectacle-
heavy storytelling device and 
deconstructing it in order to 
subvert its stigmas.

Some reviewers believe the 

portrayal of mental illness 
in 
“Legion” 
lacks 
nuance: 

Wired’s Eric Thurm claims 
the “groundlessness” with its 
treatment of mental health 
“threatens to upend the show,” 
while 
The 
Village 
Voice’s 

Angelica 
Bastién 
believes 

“limiting 
David’s 
character 

flattens the story’s emotional 
resonance.”

I would argue that “Legion” 

offers an intelligent, complex 
and 
daring 
illustration 
of 

mental illness. In fact, it wants 
the audience to understand 
David through the unreliability 
of his thought process and the 
frustrating lack of control he 
has over his illness / powers. 
Almost every sequence in each 
of the show’s first four episodes 
deliberately tries to cultivate a 
distortion of reality similar to 
David’s. From the disarmingly 
colorful production design to 
the variety of camera lenses 
and angles, “Legion” gives 
audiences an experience so 
disorienting that it not only 
forces us to look at mental 
illness 
from 
a 
different 

perspective, 
but 
also 
to 

question our own reality and 
what it means to be “normal.”

Perhaps “Legion” can also 

be seen as a broader critique 
of 
our 
society’s 
treatment 

(or lack thereof) of mental 
illness. In the first episode, 
we see David shackled to 
the confines of Clockworks 

Psychiatric Hospital, a mental 
institution he lives in after 
an attempted suicide. Later, 
a group of seedy government 
officials 
interrogate 
David, 

believing that he is the most 
powerful 
mutant 
they’ve 

ever witnessed. After a few 
failed 
experiments, 
David 

escapes from the hospital and 
receives help from psychiatric 
therapist Melanie Bird (Jean 
Smart, 
“The 
Accountant”) 

and a special team of other 
mutants, including David’s own 
girlfriend Syd Barrett (Rachel 
Keller, 
“Supernatural”). 

But even then, David is still 
bereft of control, as he is 
constantly pressured to open 
up his thoughts and memories 
under Dr. Bird’s demanding 
treatments. 
At 
one 
point, 

Dr. Bird, who denies David’s 
schizophrenia, even admits to 
her own ominous intentions: 
“I want to fix him because he 
deserves to be healthy. And 
then I want to use him.”

By having us empathize 

with David and his condition, 
“Legion” plays with this idea 
of how our culture attempts to 
understand a person suffering 
from a mental malady by 
medicating 
and 
controlling 

them. The show intentionally 
pushes us away from truly 
knowing what is going on inside 
David’s mind because it puts 
David into a box and simplifies 
the complex character he really 
is. Near the end of episode 
three, David addresses this 
concern directly: “Everybody 
in here keeps saying that I’m 
sane. What if they’re wrong?”

Nevertheless, mental illness 

remains 
a 
difficult 
topic 

when it comes to “Legion.” 
It’s true that people who are 
schizophrenic 
and 
mentally 

ill in general can live full, 
productive 
lives. 
Watching 

David 
struggle 
with 
his 

demons and ultimately become 
a charity case might be seen as 
trivializing mental health and 
perpetuating negative myths 
about 
people 
with 
mental 

illnesses. Using visual trickery 
and cool set pieces to show 
David’s 
mental 
breakdowns 

might also sound ill-advised 
in theory — artistic depictions 
of mental health should focus 
on substance more than style. 
Still, “Legion” does its best to 
demonstrate just how intricate 
mental illness can be, while 
managing to be entertaining 
and thought-provoking. As the 
show continues to grow and 
David’s 
character 
develops, 

“Legion” 
may 
potentially 

become an example of a show 
that portrays mental health in 
a sensitive manner.

Supermodel Twiggy
Twiggy and Kate: Fashion 
and the size zero epidemic

How fashion’s constructed ideals of size and skinniness have 
affected the average female buyer — Brandy Melville included

One size fits all, pigs really 

can fly and Trump didn’t win 
the 
election. 
Actually, 
one 

size fits few, pigs still can’t fly 
and the new U.S. budget has a 
Toupee Clause.

It’s long been debated that 

perhaps the fashion industry’s 
greatest 
flaw 
is 
the 
zero 

epidemic. The size zero has 
become the golden standard for 
the American woman, despite 
the impossibility and risk it 
poses.

Fashion 
of 
the 
late 

1960s 
brought 
us 
Twiggy, 

revolutionizer of supermodel 
status, but also the harsh 
ideals of female body size (not 
to blame Twiggy). Models like 
Kate Moss followed suit in 
promoting the trend and the 
overwhelming popularity of 
their zero-zero frames created 
an undeniable expectation for 
the next generation of women. 

Among 
the 
many 

implications 
and 
concerns 

behind the epidemic, body 
dysmorphia is a disorder that 
often 
manifests 
itself 
into 

anorexia nervosa and bulimia 
out of an obsessive desire to 
change 
appearance 
due 
to 

perceived 
ugliness. 
Those 

suffering from it often lock 
themselves away and avoid all 
social interaction out of severe 
sense of physical inadequacy. 
The 
disorder 
affects 
1 
in 

50 people and most women 
affected are preoccupied with 
their hips and weight.

A 
recent 
survey 
asked 

teen girls: if they could have 
anything, what it would be? 
The number one answer was 
to lose weight and keep it off. 
Yet the size zero models who 
are looked to as the standard 
of beauty are on average 13-19 
percent under their expected 
body mass index — 15 percent 
under a normal body weight 
meets the criteria for anorexia 
nervosa. Between the pages 

of underweight models are 
dieting and weight loss ads, 
enforcing these unattainable 
standards.

Yet as the decades went by, 

reality contradicted the ideal. 
The average female body size 
grew farther and farther away 
from what was once considered 
the “perfect body.” And while 
average 
women 
grew 
in 

weight, models continued to 
get thinner, generating a wider 
and more terrifying gap that 
women starve themselves to 
cross.

In 1966, Twiggy was actually 

an eight according to universal 
sizing measurements. Today 
she would measure in at a 

zero-zero. 
This 
so 
called 

“vanity sizing” — arbitrary 
swell in sizing measurements 
to accommodate larger body 
sizes 
— 
manipulates 
self-

esteem, not to mention ruins 
online shopping. But clothing 
companies found women were 
psychologically compelled to 
buy clothing with a smaller 
size, explaining the surge in 
vanity sizing. The universal 
sizing chart has been rendered 
meaningless all to be closer to 
a size zero.

To further convince girls 

of their dysmorhpia-favored 
body sizing, front running 
companies sell “one size fits 
all.” For most brands, like 
Brandy 
Melville, 
“one 
size 

fits all” measurements line up 
with a zero on universal charts 
and tend to fit girls within the 
range of small, exclusively. 
For few, the fitting room 
is a rewarding experience. 
But every other woman is 
guaranteed a traumatic fitting 
room experience finding she 
is somehow the outlier of the 
word “all.”

High 
fashion 
especially 

makes little effort to represent 
all sizes or even a healthy body 
image and the inclusion of plus 
sized shows is thought of as an 
accommodating gesture rather 
than the norm. Besides lacking 
racial diversity, size diversity 
is even sparser on the runway. 
Designers like Marc Jacob 
and Sophie Theallet featured 
plus size models in their latest 
collections — yet the feature 
of a singular plus sized model 
among so many zeroes almost 
seemed demoralizing to plus 
sized women by promoting the 
distorted mindset that they are 
somehow the outliers. 

Leaders 
of 
the 
fashion 

industry cite a number of 
reasons for failing to represent 
the plus sized majority. Some 
designers simply don’t want to, 
claiming their target will never 
be the size 12 and up since 
skinny will forever be the look. 
Karl Lagerfeld put it simply 
saying: “No one wants to see 
curvy women.”

Mentor Tim Gunn refuted 

these ideas in a recent article for 
The Washington Post slamming 
the notion that curvier women 
are at fault for the lack of 
clothing in circulation for their 
figures. The market for plus 
sized clothing is booming with 
potential and eager spenders. 
In fewer words, Gunn accused 
designers of not having any 
balls. It’s as if it never occurred 
to them they’re still designing 
for women of decades past. But 
progress is in the works and the 
hope is that one day the fashion 
industry will settle on body 
image ideals inclusive for all 
women. 

‘Mental Health in the 
Age of Trump’: A keynote 

Reflections on mental health in Trump’s America, its integration with the 
Asian/Pacific Islander community, the culture clash of “Americanization”

Last week I attended a 

keynote titled “Mental Health 
in the Age of Trump” put 
on by the Asian / Pacific 
Islander 
American 
Studies 

program. I went in expecting 
to learn more about the way 
in which Americans look at 
mental health and how it is 
evolving under the Trump 
administration. While I did 
learn a little about this, I ended 
up learning much more about 
the mental health of Asian 
Americans and the evolution 
of how we as a society have 
defined mental health. Mimi 
Khúc, University of Maryland 
Professor of Asian American 
Studies, 
was 
the 
keynote 

speaker and gave a captivating 
presentation.

The 
first 
part 
of 
the 

presentation focused on the 
different 
ways 
we 
define 

mental 
health 
and 
how 

some are questioning these 
definitions now more than ever. 
Mental health is defined by the 
World Health Organization as 
“a state of well-being in which 
every individual realizes his 
or her own potential, can cope 
with the normal stresses of 
life, can work productively and 
fruitfully, and is able to make 
a contribution to her or his 
community.”

Prominent 
figures 
like 

Khúc in the mental health 
field are starting to question 
this 
definition 
of 
mental 

health. 
One 
specific 
point 

that Khúc questions is the 
segment of the definition that 
suggests our health is likened 
to productivity. She doubts 
that mental illness is linked 
to our level of contribution 

to society. She also brought 
up a suggestion about mental 
health in our culture — when 
“sickness” 
due 
to 
mental 

health is seen as temporary, 
care for it will never become 
normalized 
within 
society. 

We need to start seeing care 
for mental health as a lifelong 
endeavor. People have good 
and bad times with their 
mental illness, but it is never 
completely absent.

A 
big 
part 
of 
Khúc’s 

presentation 
focused 

specifically 
on 
the 
mental 

health of second generation 
Asian 
Americans, 
where 

her area of expertise is at 
the University of Maryland. 
She discussed some of the 
experiences that her students, 
particularly those that are 
themselves second generation 
Asian Americans, have shared 
with her over time. They often 
report feeling very anxious 
out of the pressure they feel 
put on them to succeed. These 
students report feelings of 
depression and high levels of 
anxiety.

These 
kinds 
of 
feelings 

become even more dangerous 
when the students live in 
households 
where 
mental 

health is often not seen as an 
important issue and feel that 
they should be silent about 
their feelings. A lot of the 
time, the students talking to 
Khúc are talking about their 
mental health issues openly 
to someone for the first time. 
Anxiety and depression are 
also significant problems here 
at the University of Michigan. 
Students with mental health 
problems 
often 
feel 
their 

disorders are intensified by 
the high stress of being a 
student here, and a lot of these 
students are not satisfied with 

the mental health resources 
on campus. The University is 
working toward trying to fix 
this problem, and hopefully 
serious change comes sooner 
rather than later.

Khúc’s students also report 

that they are constantly trying 
to become more “American” 
and are caught between the 
culture of their ancestors and 
the one that they were born 
into. This problem has become 
even more difficult for some 
because of the emergence of 
the 
Trump 
administration. 

Khúc, like many, sees the 
Trump 
administration 
as 

a 
crystallization 
of 
what 

already existed in America. In 
Trump’s new sponsored health 
care plan, almost all coverage 
for mental health has been 
removed. Being a minority in 
America with mental health 
problems must be terrifying 
right now, especially if your 
parents are first generation 
immigrants. People often feel 
the need to “rage” or “hide” in 
this era, but we must fight in 
a calculated and intellectual 
way, Khúc said.

Khúc’s 
primary 
area 
of 

research is the mental health 
of Asian American mothers. 
She explores the issue of 
postpartum depression, and 
the extreme stress society 
places 
on 
mothers 
to 
be 

constantly happy while caring 
for their child. We don’t talk 
about how hard society makes 
motherhood, 
yet 
still 
the 

expectation for mothers is for 
them to be perfect. This is even 
harder for second generation 
minority Americans who have 
the added stress of deciding 
how hard they want to try 
to make their family unit 
“American” or stick to the 
values of their parents.

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW

If you haven’t yet seen Clean 
Bandit’s new music video for 
“Symphony,” now is the time. 
The video is emotional, well 
filmed and perfectly in tune 
with the lyrics and feeling of the 
song.
At the very beginning of the 
video for “Symphony,” a man 
gets into a bike crash on his 
way home from the library. The 
rest of the video cuts between 
the grief his boyfriend is going 
through and flashbacks of their 
relationship together: Talking 
and laughing together on a bed, 
racing through a field. In the 
backdrop, a symphony is per-
forming — featuring Zara Lars-
son as its lead vocalist — and 
toward the end of the video, the 
conductor of the symphony is 
revealed to be the grieving boy-
friend.
When I first started watching 
the video, thinking about it in 
conjunction with its lyrics, it 
didn’t make sense to me. “Sym-
phony” doesn’t sound like a song 
about grief. The main actor in 
the video, playing the boyfriend, 
does a terrific performance of 
the emotional tolls that grief has 
on a person: He breaks down 
crying, he smashes a mirror. But 
at first listen, “Symphony” isn’t a 
sad song or even really an angry 

one.
Then, about halfway through 
the video, it hit me: “Symphony” 
is a song about frustration. It’s 
about being on one side of some-
thing, and longing — desperately 
— for a second side that doesn’t 
exist.
This is what the video does so 
well: It captures what it feels 
like to be so close to an impos-

sible love. And what that feels 
like, of course, is agony. By inter-
cutting the boyfriend’s grief 
— hearing about the accident 
from the police, breaking down, 
smashing the mirror — with the 
memories of their relationship, 
the video shows us how infuri-
ating it is, how heartbreaking, to 
know simultaneously how good 
something was, and how impos-
sible it is to ever have it again.
“I just wanna be part of your 
symphony,” Larsson sings, and 
this line both appreciates the 
beauty of the men’s love and 
gives a hint of the frustration 
that follows the bike accident. 
For all that the main charac-
ter wants is to rejoin his lover’s 

symphony, to go back to the hap-
piness that they had during their 
relationship; it’s something he 
can never do. The lyrics do carry 
further hints of the desperation 
that follows loss, such as “I can’t 
find the key without you,” and 
“When you’re gone, I feel incom-
plete.”
The revelation that the boy-
friend is the symphony’s con-
ductor brings this emotion to a 
head, because as a profession for 
him, in this moment, it makes 
complete sense. Conducting is a 
movement of precision, of con-
trol. It is also the action used 
to harness the beauty of a sym-
phony, to bring it into being and 
to have it make sense. Perhaps 
this is why, at the very end of the 
video, there is a shot of the audi-
ence: Completely empty, except 
for the man from the beginning 
of the video, sitting alone in the 
concert hall with tears on his 
face.
This is a beautiful moment that 
perfectly rounds out the striking 
emotional impact of the video. 
“Symphony” is thoughtfully and 
sensitively put together from 
beginning to end, and in every 
way that it could have hoped to 
work out, it does.

Daily 
Arts 
Writers 
Will 

Stewart and Becky Portman 
discuss mental health in the 
coming-of-age comedy “Perks 
of Being a Wallflower.” The 
movie 
focuses 
on 
Charlie, 

a 
high 
school 
freshman 

suffering 
from 
depression 

and anxiety after his best 
friend’s suicide and aunt’s 
death. 
After 
befriending 
a 

group of free-spirited seniors, 
Charlie begins to find his true 
self. “Perks,” based on the 
bestselling YA novel, is one 
of the most defining teenage 
movies documenting mental 
health. Stewart and Portman, 
however, differ in how they 
view this portrayal.

Hipster teens doing weird 

stuff: What’s new?

High 
school 
stereotypes 

exist in movies because there 
is some truth behind them. 
Every school will have its 
fair share of cocky jocks, 
band-geeks 
and 
alternative 

theater types. If anything, 
this pseudo-hierarchal order 
of popularity is built into our 
culture. 
But 
these 
groups, 

in reality, are never quite as 
predictable as movies depict 
them to be. Sometimes, there’ll 
be that straggler impossible 
to pinpoint in one group, who 
seamlessly blends in and out 
of each social circle like a 
charisma-chameleon. Or, the 
band geek wins Homecoming 
King 
instead 
of 
the 
star 

quarterback, 
and 
everyone 

freaks out and questions the 
meaning of life. “In Perks of 
Being a Wallflower,” these 
cliches 
are 
challenged, 

especially the role of the 
handsome and athletic football 
star who also happens to be 
gay. 

Still, in most high school 

movies, the alternative theatre 
kids fulfill the role of just 
about every possible cliché. 
They listen to sad music, do 
drugs and, most importantly, 
are either severely anxious or 
depressed. Here, the problem 
isn’t the depiction of adolescent 
mental 
health 
issues, 
but 

rather always characterizing 
the same type of student as 
having “problems.” But, the 
truth is: not only alternative, 
edgy, “hipster” kids suffer 
from depression in high school. 
And, not every cliché hipster is 
depressed in the first place.

Mental health cannot be 

assumed within each social 
group based on preconceived 
notions. 
Certainly 
the 

aforementioned 
“hipster” 

enjoys their fair share of ’80s 
post-punk and has probably 
listened to “The Queen is 
Dead” by The Smiths 100 
times, 
but 
depression 
and 

anxiety are not unique only to 
them. Every year, thousands 

of 
teens 
with 
depression 

are undiagnosed and left to 
suffer alone. It’s essential that 
filmmakers and authors of YA 
fiction realize that other kinds 
of students are depressed, 
too. Maybe it’s more fun for 
viewers to watch the tortured 
artistic type, but depicting 
only one kind of student as 
predictably depressed paints 
an 
unrealistic, 
dangerous 

picture of mental health.

We 
all 
want 
to 
find 

distractions 
from 
the 

humdrum 
of 
our 
boring, 

mediocre lives. For some, it 
is music, or maybe sports or 
perhaps 
even 
experimental 

performance 
art. 
Whatever 

the distraction, we all want 
something to keep us busy. For 
the rag tag team of friends in 
“Perks of Being a Wallflower,” 
their distraction is reckless, 
sometimes 
destructive, 

behavior. 
First 
we 
have 

Patrick, the unapologetically 
flamboyant 
stepbrother 
of 

the 
ever-complicated, 
ever-

experienced Sam. Then we 
have the overbearing bossiness 
of Mary Elizabeth and the 
quiet, mousey Alice. Thrown 
into the mix is our dopey, 
adorable loner, Charlie, who 
has been through some intense, 
ambiguous shit. When they 
come together, this odd group 
of friends find distractions 
in their existence with the 
panache of the authors and 
artists of “Midnight in Paris.” 
Their nights are filled with 
adventure, they are down for 
anything and they probably 
smoke more weed than Snoop 
Dogg. There is something so 
relatable and authentic about 
their interactions. They use 
substances, experiences and 
friendship to numb the outside 
pressures of High School life.

No one’s life is perfect. Sam 

does not know how to accept 
love, Patrick performs through 
his life to make the bad stuff go 
away, Charlie pushes away his 
past trauma till it almost kills 
him and even the stereotypical 
quarterback, Brad, is in the 
closet about his feelings for 
Patrick. What “Perks” does is 
give voice to those who cannot 
voice themselves. We see the 
problems on screen that we 
can identify with, happening 
to characters we care about. 

This group of friends is hodge 
podge of their own issues, but 
they deal with them together, 
doing whatever they can to get 
through. Seeing characters’ 
struggles that we can relate to 
gives depth and authenticity to 
an otherwise silenced topic.

How 
they 
talk 
about 

mental health

“Perks 
of 
Being 
a 

Wallflower” 
’s 
protagonist, 

Charlie, describes his own 
depression 
and 
anxiety 
as 

“being bad.” When he talks 
about avoiding these feelings, 
he says things like “if I get 
bad again.” Of course, anxiety 
is not good, but just because 
someone suffers from it does 
not mean they’re “bad.”

Charlie’s lack of empathy 

may make people feel like it’s 
entirely their fault for their 
mental health. But, “Perks of 
Being a Wallflower” is not to 
blame for this issue. Rather, 
the American culture that 
perpetuates vicious ideas — 
like seeing a therapist is a 
sign of weakness — is the true 
culprit. The whole concept 
of 
stomping 
down 
those 

less fortunate than oneself 
is inherently American (I’ll 
leave this to be discussed by 
those much smarter and more 
qualified than myself). The 
movie shows a bleak reality for 
too many people trapped in a 
vicious cycle of negative self 
talk and deep insecurity.

“Perks” does a fantastic job 

of creating a well-rounded 
character who also happens 
to suffer from severe anxiety. 
Movie characters like Charlie 
are capable of improving the 
social climate, especially when 
exposed to younger audiences. 
However, when he actually 
begins having panic attacks, 
the screen goes black and skips 
ahead a few moments. Viewers 
don’t actually see him during 
his most intense moments of 
anxiety, which I think is a 
huge loss. The purpose of the 
screen blacking out attempts 
to visually recreate Charlie’s 
perspective 
during 
these 

moments, but it feels like the 
director is tip-toeing around 
potential controversy.

Mental illness does not exist 

in a vacuum; it exists in lives, 
in people, in individuals. We, 
as viewers, might see mental 
illness as a disease that can be 
cured with a stint in the psych 
ward or some medication, but 
mental illness is an ongoing 
struggle. Many films do not 
attempt 
to 
capture 
coping 

with mental illness as a daily 
endeavor, but “Perks” manages 
to tell the story of Charlie’s 
struggle through a lens of 
moving forward.

While 
films 
like 
“Girl, 

Interrupted” and “It’s Kind 
of 
a 
Funny 
Story” 
depict 

the 
actual 
institution 
and 

experience of dealing with the 
worst of mental illness, “Perks” 
delves into Charlie’s life after

A life in Cudi and Smith: 
Me, music, mental health

Search “music and mental 

health” on Google – I know, 
I’m 
an 
incredibly 
skilled 

researcher – and a lot of 
positive physical correlations 
between the body and music 
come up. It turns out tunes 
can decrease the intensity 
of pain, increase endurance 
while exercising, improve poor 
sleeping 
patterns, 
prevent 

insomnia, enhance blood flow 
and so on. Basically, if you’re 
ever wondering why you can 
run that extra .25 miles on the 
treadmill when Nikki Minaj’s 
“Anaconda” comes on, it’s got 
something to do with music, 
the triggering of dopamine and 
some neurons firing.

There are some positive 

mental 
benefits, 
too. 
Ever 

heard someone say, “Listening 
to Mozart makes you smarter” 
and been like, “Well, that’s total 
bullshit”? Well, it’s actually not 
total bullshit. According to our 
good ‘ol friend science, there’s 
this thing called the Mozart 
Effect, 
which 
posits 
that 

listening to Mozart’s music, 
or any classical piece, induces 
a 
short-term 
improvement 

in certain mental tasks. That 
means “Piano Sonata No.12 In 
F, K.332:2. Adagio” will get you 
hype as fuck for that Ethics of 
Marketing paper you forgot to 
write until three hours before 
it was due. Talking long term, 
music is also known to reduce 
stress and anxiety, improve 
cognitive performance, elevate 
mood, 
help 
performance 

in 
high-pressure 
situations 

and 
relieve 
symptoms 
of 

depression.

But me, music and mental 

health have always had sort of 
a volatile relationship.

I’m 13, and Kid Cudi has 

just released Man on the Moon: 
The End of Day. XXL’s already 
included the rapper in its 2009 
Freshman Class, and no one 
can stop singing his infectious 
single “Day ‘N’ Nite” — but 
Man on the Moon elevated his 
status as sad, stoner rapper to 
an unprecedented level.

Everyone remembers where 

they were the first time they 
heard “Soundtrack 2 My Life;” 
that shit just stays with you. I 
was sitting in Austin Ortwein’s 
living room pretending to like 
the taste of Hpnotiq, because 
for some reason the bright 

blue, 
almost 
radioactive-

looking alcohol was all my 
friends’ older siblings could 
get their hands on for us. So, 
there I sat, sippin’, as Cudder 
belted out, “I got some issues 
that nobody can see / And all of 
these emotions are pouring out 
of me” – I know you can hear it 
now – and at that moment I felt 
like everything made sense. A 
cliché, no doubt; but as a white, 
upper-middle class female who 
felt she had nothing to really 
be sad about, and yet, still felt 
pretty sad, it was significant. 
Go read the Pitchfork review 
of the album, and they’ll say 
that Cudi’s a walking cliché, a 
wannabe sad, deep stoner. But 
maybe that’s the point; maybe 
that’s what a lot of us needed 
then. At least that’s what I 
needed then.

That album, as well as his 

sophomore release Man on the 
Moon II: Legend of Mr Rager, 
went on to soundtrack much of 
my high school experience; Kid 
Cudi got sadder, and so did I.

I’m 16, and I’ve only just 

heard Elliott Smith crooning 
the muted ballad “Between 
the Bars” over a scene in Good 
Will Hunting for the first time. 
The 
Portland-based 
indie 

rocker would go on to lose an 
Oscar to Celine Dion for one 
of his songs in the movie – of 
course Titanic’s “My Heart 
Will Go On” fucking won – but 
that wasn’t really what he was 
about, anyways. Melodic and 
melancholic, Smith’s music is 
some of the most powerful to 
come out of the post-grunge 
era of the late ’90s. But where 
there is grunge, there is also 
drug-use and alcohol-abuse, 
and Smith was notorious for 
his — a theme that would 
characterize his life and death 
and music.

Smith 
was 
shooting 
up 

heroine; I was drinking. A 
lot. My best friend in high 
school almost died of alcohol 
poisoning on a hot Las Vegas 
night in the middle of July after 

drinking 
straight 
Everclear 

inside some abandoned home 
in some gated community of a 
name I don’t remember. At the 
hospital near my house, I had 
to talk to the police and the 
doctors and her parents and my 
parents, all while borderline 
incoherent myself. Behavior 
along these lines continued 
throughout my adolescence, 
as did confrontations about it 
with my parents.

So you can understand why 

“Between the Bars” – which 
begins with “Drink up baby 
/ Stay up all night / With the 
things you could do / You won’t 
but you might / The potential 
you’ll be that you’ll never see” – 
struck a chord. It was incredibly 
painful to disappoint your 
parents and yourself and not 
understanding why you kept 
doing things that disappointed 
your parents and yourself. It 
was incredibly confusing to 
feel like you were ruining your 
coming-of-age-narrative as it 
was being written.

I have a memory of being 

sprawled out across my bed, 
teary-eyes fixed on my dark 
blue 
ceiling, 
feeling 
like 

everything was collapsing, like 
I’d ruined my chances of doing 
anything important, of being 
anyone important.

Now I’m 21 and comfortably 

seeing a therapist, while Kid 
Cudi is in rehab for drug and 
alcohol-related 
depression, 

and Elliott Smith is dead of 
apparent suicide. I’ve realized 
I used music as a companion to 
my sadness, a friend to sit with 
while I sulked; they used it as 
an outlet of expression for their 
depression. I figured my shit 
out; I’m not sure they ever did.

But 
their 
influence 
left 

lasting impressions. Kid Cudi 
ended up helping me curate 
my budding musical interests, 
what 
would 
become 
broad 

affinities for everything from 
Young Thug to Yo La Tengo. 
Elliott 
Smith’s 
“Between 

the Bars” ended up being 
the subject of my Common 
Application essay — which is 
what ended up getting me into 
Michigan.

And that, to me, is incredibly 

indicative of the dynamism of 
music, it’s power to play both 
the catalyst and the cure. Isn’t 
it strange, that dichotomy? It 
has the ability to both induce 
depression and pull you out of 
it. Thankfully, for me, it did the 
latter.

tragedy (losing his friend to 
suicide, coming to terms with 
his childhood trauma, etc.) and 
moving on. “Perks” illustrates 
Charlie’s 
reintroduction 
into 

daily life after an incident 
merely dubbed as “bad” whose 
ambiguity furthers and fuels 
Charlie’s rocky road to recovery. 
That is the realness of it though, 
that mental illness is not just felt 
in mental wards of white-walled 
hospitals, it is felt in suburban 
Pittsburgh, it is felt on college 
campuses like ours.

Charlie is a case of PTSD, 

reliving 
traumatic 
memories 

in his mind, in constant fear of 
being guilty and responsible for 
a tragic event. As his mind does 

loops around the recollections of 
his past, he himself spirals into 
blackouts. As the camera spins at 
odd angles and the screen fades 
to black, the viewer is just as 
surprised as Charlie when they 
find out what happened. The 
void Charlie experiences during 
his blackouts is to be filled with 
the imagination of the viewer. 
This allows for the audience 
to empathize with Charlie and 
his emotional trauma on a more 
intimate level.

Conclusions
“Perks of Being a Wallflower” 

is a heartfelt and inspiring high 
school movie. I don’t really think 
it says as much as it could about 

teenage depression and anxiety, 
but the movie’s real intentions 
are to show self discovery, love 
and friendship.

— Will Stewart
“Perks of Being a Wallflower” 

is an endearing and honest 
portrait of a fresh-faced teen 
struggling with major emotional 
trauma amidst trying to make 
friends, get through high school 
and tell the girl he loves how he 
truly feels. I think that “Perks” 
does a great job of highlighting 
the often overlooked aspects of 
mental illness and reinforces 
the fact that mental illness does 
not define you.
