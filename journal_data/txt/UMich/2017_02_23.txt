Medical 
School 
Prof. 

Michelle 
Meade 
addressed 

common health and health-
care disparities and how to 
promote 
positive 
changes 

to 
the 
current 
health-care 

system for disabled people 
Wednesday night in Mason 
Hall. The event, sponsored by 
the Interprofessional Health 
Student Organization, drew a 
crowd of about 20 students.

Meade directs programs for 

the University of Michigan’s 
Rehabilitation 
Engineering 

Program, developing health-
management technologies for 
disabled individuals. 

Meade 
began 
her 

presentation by pointing out 
problems with defining the 
term “disability,” which differs 
depending on which area of 
academia or society people are 
processing the definition from.

“The actual definition of 

disability or having a disability 
depends on where you look,” 
she said. “In surveys and 
research, it generally is defined 
by limitations; in some policy, 
it’s defined by a lack of ability 
to work and then in clinical 
practice, it’s diagnosis.”

As 
opposed 
to 
health 

disparities, 
which 
revolve 

around medical treatment and 
the burden of the illness, health-
care disparities deal with how 
the disease is managed and 
what is done to assist those 

living with disability. Meade 
said those who are disabled 
have an equal amount of need 
for health care as non-disabled 
individuals, yet they do not get 
the treatment or health care 
they need.

“Despite 
having 
no 

differences in regards to aspects 
of health insurance or mutual 
care … you have increased need 
and decreased access (for the 
disabled),” she said.

In 
her 
paper 
“The 

intersection 
of 
disability 

and health care disparities: 
a 
conceptual 
framework,” 

Meade, along with University 
researchers Elham Mahmoudi 
and Shoou-Yih Daniel Lee, 
created a narrative flowchart 
to 
describe 
the 
factors 

contributing 
to 
the 
poor 

health care experienced by the 
disabled. Meade said certain 
elements contribute to health-

care disparities; more so for the 
disabled.

“It’s not ‘one-size-fits-all,’ 

” she said. “I think the easiest 
way to understand it, or for me 
to explain it, is that you can 
have the most wonderful doctor 
providing fantastic information 
… but if he’s speaking in English 
and the individual only speaks 
Spanish, there’s a mismatch 
in terms of needs, and that’s 

In the wake of controversial 

emails, the desecration of prayer 
space and other racially charged 
incidents, 
the 
Residential 

College held an open forum in 
the Keene Theater Wednesday 
night to debrief the campus 
climate. During this session, RC 
students, faculty and staff were 
all encouraged to express their 
thoughts on these recent events, 
and offer support to fellow 
Wolverines.

The 
community 
forum 

was 
run 
by 
members 
of 

the 
Residential 
College, 
an 

interdisciplinary 
liberal 
arts 

living community within LSA. 
Though 
few 
students 
were 

there, multiple faculty and staff 
members were present at the 
event. Administrators such as 
Jon Wells, the director of the RC, 
and Charlie Murphy, the director 
of academic services for the RC, 
sponsored the event.

The event was broken up into 

three sections that included 
reflections and small and large 
group discussions. People were 
invited to come and go as they

LSA Student Government 

hosted a meeting Wednesday 
evening to discuss resolutions 
relating to the Sexual Assault 
and Awareness Center and 
increasing 
resources 
for 

transfer students.

The 
body 
passed 
a 

resolution 
co-sponsoring 

SAPAC’s Healthy Relationship 
Dialogues, aiming to create 
conversation 
and 
advocacy 

around sexual assault that 
occurs on campus. With the 
passing 
of 
this 
resolution, 

LSA SG will join the current 
list of co-sponsors for SAPAC, 
specifically by co-sponsoring 
and helping to advertise a series 
of dialogues toward the end of 
March to help raise awareness 
toward sexual assault.

LSA 
junior 
Nicholas 

Fadanelli, 
LSA 
SG 
general 

counsel, explained that many 
sexual 
assaults 
on 
campus 

may not be made public, and 
highlighted 
the 
importance 

of LSA SG’s role in creating 
conversations 
about 
these 

issues.

When 
posters 
promoting 

white supremacy were found 
covering the walls of University 
of Michigan buildings on multiple 
occasions 
last 
fall, 
students, 

including Art & Design senior 
Keysha Wall, tore them down. 
When Islamophobic messages 
were chalked on the Diag last 
spring, a group of Muslim students 
were some of the first to grab rags 
and buckets of water to wash the 
messages off themselves.

As bias incidents continue 

to 
occur 
across 
campus 

despite University-wide emails 
denouncing 
the 
actions 
of 

the 
perpetrators, 
students 

have started to question the 
effectiveness of the way the 
administration responds to the 
attacks. Many have also called 
out University President Mark 
Schlissel 
for 
not 
adequately 

affirming his support for what 
they believe is minority students 
on campus.

Wall, 
a 
member 
of 
the 

University’s chapter of By Any 
Means Necessary, expressed her 
disappointment in the University’s 
response to the posters targeting 
minority groups on campus that 
occurred earlier this year. She 
believes the perpetuation of bias-
related incidents is contingent 
on the lack of administrative 
pushback against hate speech.

“We can say that these attacks 

began with the racist and fascist 
fliers that started going up last 
semester,” she said. “Every time 
they went up, it was students, 
myself 
included, 
who 
tore 

them down. During this, the 
University’s official statement was 
that they would take no action 
against ‘free speech,’ although I 
think we can all agree that what 
those fliers were expressing was 
hate speech, not free speech. And 
so the fliers continued to be put 
up.”

Despite students’ expressions 

of anger regarding the chalkings 
and 
posters, 
the 
University 

legally could not remove either, 
as they were posted in areas 
meant for the dissemination

Critics demand consequences for victims while Muslim women fear backlash

Two of three hate crimes 

reported in the week following 
the 2016 presidential election at 
the University of Michigan were 
recently determined to be falsely 
reported to the Ann Arbor Police 
Department, and updates have 
raised concerns about backlash 
for marginalized students.

The first incident occurred on 

Nov. 11, when a student reported 
being approached by an unknown 

man who threatened to set her on 
fire if she didn’t remove her hijab. 
The incident became national 
news, with outlets like The 
Washington Post covering the 
report. The other reported crime 
occurred on Nov. 15, when a man 
allegedly scratched a woman’s 
face with a safety pin. AAPd 
deemed both incidents to have 
never occured. 

A student also reported being 

verbally assaulted and pushed 
down a hill on Nov. 12. While 
this report was verifiable, AAPD 
stated there was no evidence 

to determine a suspect, and the 
investigation 
has 
since 
been 

halted.

All three of these reports 

motivated significant activism on 
campus. Music, Theatre & Dance 
senior James Ross Kilmeade 
organized a protest that attracted 
more than 200 people in response 
to the first hate crime, and nearly 
150 people gathered on the Diag 
at an additional protest on Nov. 
18.

While the student involved 

in the Nov. 11 crime is not being 
charged for the false report, 

detectives 
have 
submitted 
a 

warrant request for criminal 
charges against the Ann Arbor 
resident involved in the safety pin 
incident.

Some 
community 
members 

have been dissatisfied with the 
reaction to the falsity of these 
reports, and have called for 
repercussions, as well as a level of 
action similar to events organized 
after the initial reports were 
made.

City 
Council 
unanimously 

passed a resolution to enthusiastic 
applause Tuesday night approving 
funding for improvements to the 
pedestrian crossing on Fuller Road 
outside Huron High School, where 
a high-school student was hit by a 
car and killed on his way to school 
in October.

Ann 
Arbor 
residents, 
and 

the citizen’s advocacy group A2 
Safe Transport, have frequently 
expressed frustration over the 
city’s slow progress on pedestrian 
safety. A school safety report 
released by the city administrator 
earlier this month—weeks after 
planned release time—did not 
contain crosswalk evaluations or 
cost estimates as it was supposed to.

Ann 
Arbor 
resident 
Kathy 

Griswold, a member of A2 Safe 
Transport, said the resolution did 

not provide sufficient protection for 
pedestrians.

“This would be a perfect example 

of what not to do if you wanted to 
create a safe crosswalk,” she said. 
“Engineering 101, you would fail if 
you did something like this. This 
has three lanes of traffic, no refuge 
island and, until recently, no street 
lighting. We deserve better.”

The 
original 
text 
of 
the 

resolution called for the installation 
of a Rectangular Rapid Flashing 
Beacon on Fuller Road, and 
approved the $50,000 toward 
its 
construction, 
which 
City 

Administrator Howard Lazarus 
estimated would be needed. RRFBs 
allow 
pedestrians 
to 
activate 

flashing lights on crosswalk signs 
before crossing, alerting drivers to 
their presence.

Councilmember 
Chuck 

Warpehoski (D–Ward 5) proposed 
an amendment to the resolution 
during the meeting, however, 

adding the option to install another 
type of crossing device if deemed 
appropriate by city staff. The 
amendment passed unanimously.

“I believe that this is a crosswalk 

that merits some sort of active 
beacon,” he said. “An RRFB is one 
of those most frequently deployed; 
I think it would make sense that 
that would be the most likely one 
we would see. But we have other 
beacons in our community — we 
have a HAWK beacon, for example, 
over by the YMCA on Huron Street.”

High-Intensity 
Activated 

Crosswalk Beacons are elevated 
above 
the 
roadway, 
whereas 

RRFBs are posted on the side of the 
roadway. Councilmember Zachary 
Ackerman (D–Ward 3) pointed out, 
though, that HAWK beacons cost 
approximately $200,000 each — 
four times more than an RRFB.

Warpehoski said if city staff 

determined 
a 
HAWK 
was 

necessary, City Council would find 

the money for it.

“In terms of the question of 

a HAWK, or if there were more 
expensive treatment identified 
by the staff, I would trust staff 
to understand that we see this 
as a priority to be expedited, and 
if they need additional funds 
to come back to us for those 
additional funds,” he said.

Councilmember Jane Lumm 

(I–Ward 2) responded to a memo 
Lazarus sent Monday to City 
Council requesting to delay the 
resolution, saying there was no 
valid reason to.

“Administrator Lazarus sent us 

a memo last night that mentioned 
a couple concerns related to this 
resolution that I’d like to speak 
to,” she said. “While Mr. Lazarus 
did not mention his concerns 
when we met Thursday I do want 
to address and explain why in 
my view and the view of many 
residents, there is no valid reason 
to delay this action. The memo 
suggested we should wait because 
the exact location of the crosswalk 
is still being reviewed. That’s fine. 
But it’s not a reason to delay this 
resolution.”

Billionaire businessman Dan 

Gilbert has proposed a building 

at the historic J.L. Hudson site 

in downtown Detroit. The 734-

foot tower, a few feet taller than 

the Renaissance tower, would be 

the tallest building in Michigan 

if erected.

Detroit’s Downtown 

Development Authority 

approved Gilbert’s plans 

Wednesday morning. Gilbert 

has until Nov. 1 of this year to 

get finances in order and then 

construction will begin in 

December.

The proposed mix-use 

development will be 52 stories 

tall and include 250 units of 

residential living, a market and 

two floors of retail and office 

space. It is estimated that the 

building would cost more than 

$700 million.

Gilbert and his real-estate 

firm Bedrock own nearly 90 

properties in the Detroit area. 

This project is of particular 

importance to Gilbert and 

many Detroiters because of its 

historical significance.

The site was home to the 

former Hudson’s department 

store, until it was demolished 

in 1998. A website has been 

launched for the new building, 

Bedrock’s hope for the site.

“This new, transformational 

development will rise from the 

two-acre site of the former J.L. 

Hudson’s Department Store,” 

the website reads. “It will be a 

catalyst for returning the once-

commercial heartbeat of the 

city to an economic engine once 

again.”

of information. If government-
financed state universities adopt 
speech codes preventing free 
speech, organizations like the 
American Civil Liberties Union 
argue such regulations violate the 
First Amendment and constitute 
government censorship.

University 
spokesman 
Rick 

Fitzgerald 
said 
though 
the 

University cannot remove fliers or 
chalkings on the basis of content, 
it did remove the fliers from places 
where postings are not allowed. He 
further explained how, as a place 
of higher education, the University 
seeks to combat hateful speech 
through education.

“The general philosophy is 

that the First Amendment right 
is interpreted broadly, by us and 
by the courts, to mean all kinds 
of speech, including writings or 
posters or chalkings,” he said. “We 
believe that the best approach to 
combat speech that is hateful, or 
that we think is inappropriate or 
that we disagree with, is the use of 
more speech and education. The 
educational component is a really 
important part of our mission and 
our responsibility, to help educate 
the young people and others 
who are part of our University 
community, and that’s a role we 
take very seriously.”

Fitzgerald 
noted 
if 
speech 

contains threats or promises of 
harm, the University and law 
enforcement can get involved. He 
also pointed to the University’s bias 
response team as a unique feature 
that not all schools have to combat 
bias incidents.

“If I threaten to do something, 

physical harm to you, that’s a 
threat and is dealt with differently 
than speech,” Fitzgerald said. 
“Having a bias response team is not 
something that all campuses have, 
our own Division of Public Safety 
and Security and our own police 
force that is sensitive to and trains 
specifically for college campuses is 
not something that every campus 
has.”

In response to the racist poster 

incidents, student organization 
Students4Justice drafted a petition 
to Schlissel in September with a 
list of demands. These demands 
included requests for Schlissel to 
declare solidarity with students of 
color, schedule more office hours 
and time for students to voice their 
concerns to the president directly, 
and to display a Black Lives Matter 
flag — as means of addressing the 
humanity of Black students.

The petition was re-drafted 

in February after racist and 
anti-Semitic emails were sent 
out to University engineering 
and computer science students, 
and a prayer rug in the Shapiro 
reflection 
room 
was 
defiled. 

Though the University released 
official 
statementscondemning 

the 
incidents, 
Wall 
believes 

administrators need to take more 
aggressive action in punishing the 
perpetrators.

“When those racist and anti-

Semitic emails went out, and 
students, outraged and scared, 
marched to President Schlissel’s 
front door, he asked what he should 
do, what the University should do, 
what we wanted him to do, about 
the situation,” Wall said. “But the 
fact of the matter is that his concern 
was a long time coming, because 
this was not a new situation. Each 
time the University has done 
nothing to protect its students from 
violence, racism and bigotry. They 
do two things: They are letting us 

know we don’t matter, and they 
are making it clear to racists and 
fascists and bigots that they won’t 
face any repercussions for harming 
students.”

Walls explained that one of the 

ways students can protect their 
rights, and the rights of vulnerable 
people on campus, is to protest 
— even if the University opposes 
their methods. She affirmed how 
powerful students can be when 
they come together.

“Student strikes and protests 

are incredibly powerful,” she said. 
“I often think that we lose sight 
of the sheer amount of power we 
as the student body have when 
influencing what goes on here on 
campus, and also in the rest of 
the nation. Right now, we need 
to continue fighting for our most 
vulnerable 
peoples, 
especially 

undocumented 
students. 
We 

must also set the example for 
the University and the rest of the 
nation, and we cannot wait to only 
do so if the University gives us the 
OK to protest.”

Other 
social 
groups 
have 

attempted to harness the power 
of student activism. In an October 
meeting in the Michigan Union, 
Students4Justice leader Vikrant 
Garg, a Public Health student, 
said the administration needs to 
acknowledge the large amount 
of emotional and physical labor 
student activists put into their 
work. He also explained how, 
through 
student 
activism, 

Students4Justice attained a space 
in the Union to organize and reflect 
after meeting with Schlissel.

“We 
looked 
at 
the 

administration to be people who 
are receptive to student activism 
and student influences, and open 
to change,” Garg said. “There is a 
lot of unpaid emotional, physical 
and academic labor from students 
of color and other marginalized 
students on this campus — so 
this space that was created, was 
created in response to student 
activism on this campus and that 
has yet to be acknowledged by the 
administration.”

To show their disappointment 

in the administration’s response 
to recent bias incidents, members 
of Students4Justice have called 
for more protests as well — the 
most recent being the Campus 
Day Silent Protest on Feb. 17. 
This event was coupled with 
the release of a document titled, 
“Letter to President Schlissel 
#SchlisselWYA,” which voiced 
the group’s dissatisfaction with 
Schlissel for not answering its 
demands or voicing solidarity with 
its cause.

The group expressed frustration 

that Schlissel responded to a 
petition 
from 
supporters 
of 

President Donald Trump last fall 
who stated they did not feel safe on 
campus, but has not yet responded 
to their demands for a more 
inclusive campus.

“When our demands were 

first presented to you over dinner, 
the demands were glossed over 
and forgotten,” the letter reads. 
“Interestingly enough, according to 
your post-election interview with 
NPR in Fall of 2016, you reached 
out to the students who supported 
President Donald Trump after 
a 
simple 
Google 
document, 

#NotMyCampus, was sent out. It 
is very frustrating as an activist to 
not be acknowledged despite the 
time we dedicate to change on this 
campus for marginalized groups, 
whereas it takes a single Google 
document for primarily white 
students with oppressive opinions 
to grasp your attention.”

The 
letter 
also 
criticized 

Schlissel’s lack of understanding 
regarding his role of power in the 
University, and accused him of 
relying completely on his Diversity, 
Equality, and Inclusion plan — 
released last October — to avoid 
discussions of race.

“You need to understand your 

own identities and the power you 
have in creating a culture that is 
not oppressive for marginalized 
students,” 
the 
letter 
reads. 

“Instead, you lean on the Diversity, 
Equity, and Inclusion Plan to prove 
your commitment to diversity.”

The DEI plan was put into 

place with the goal of achieving 
a diverse and inclusive campus 
over the next five years, through 
initiatives including the increase 
of staff diversity, retention of 
under-privileged students and the 
assurance of equal compensation 
for all races, genders and identities. 
The overall plan comprises 49 unit 
plans created by all school, colleges 
and departments at the University. 
Two student panels consisting of 
25 undergraduate and graduate 
students 
each 
convene 
every 

month to discuss new strategies 
and ideas with DEI leaders.

Fitzgerald noted the plan was 

conceived as a sort of “ground-up 
initiative,” and students are still 
encouraged to voice their ideas and 
opinions to improve its quality.

“The plan was intended from 

the very beginning to be one that is 
updated and evolved; it was never 
thought:‘Here’s the five year plan, 
follow that and we will see you 
in five years,’ ” he said. “Updates 
and adjustments along the way 
are expected, and student input is 
critically important to that effort.”

In an interview earlier this 

month, Chief Diversity Officer Rob 
Sellers, vice provost for equity and 
inclusion, explained that though 
the plan can’t prevent individual 
hateful incidents on campus, it will, 
over a period of time, create a more 
inclusive environment.

“We have a whole lot of 

incidents that are sparks, and these 
sparks are being thrown on a floor 
that is full of gasoline, and so these 
fires are raging,” he said. “(We) 
cannot prevent the sparks. What 
the DEI is trying to do is create an 
environment where those sparks 
do not lead to explosions and fires. 
The fact of the matter is it’s going to 
take a while before we see all of the 
changes.”

Wall believes though the plan 

appears cohesive and proactive 
on the surface, it does not address 
how the University responds to 
bias incidents — one of the core 
concerns of groups such as BAMN 
and Students4Justice.

“I think one of the main problems 

with the DEI plan is that it mainly 
outlines more ways in which the 
University will ‘look into’ racist 
and biased/bigoted events,” Wall 
said. “Many of the points highlight 
looking at numbers, doing surveys 
or opening more lines for people to 
report bigoted events. These things 
seem proactive on the surface, but 
the fact is the problem has never 
been the need for more accurate 
numbers, or the University not 
knowing about the issues that 
have been plaguing the campus; 
the problem has always been how 
the University responds to these 
incidents.”

Wall explained the importance 

of ensuring students of color, 
LGBTQ students and immigrant 
students feel safe and a part of a 
diverse, inclusionary campus.

“We cannot be indecisive or 

weak in our actions now, and 
it is absolutely the onus of the 
University to prove that these are 
values that it upholds,” she said.

pleased to encourage an open 
environment. The discussions 
emphasized 
finding 
ways 

to challenge the racism and 
xenophobia present on campus, 
and how the RC could support 
marginalized students.

Wells reflected on the current 

presidential 
administration, 

saying 
its 
goals 
stand 
in 

stark contrast to those of the 
University of Michigan.

“I think, like the nation as 

a whole, the campus is very 
divided,” Wells said. “I think in 
some ways this current president 
is 
antithetical 
to 
everything 

that many of us conceive us as 
important in a university — open, 
promoting certain kinds of social 
and economic reform — and many 
of us feel that this current admin is 
really opposite of what many of us 

believe is important.”

He also commented on the 

rising tensions that are present as 
a result of the election.

“There is this sort of tension 

that exists on campus,” Wells 
said. “There are people who, if 
they’re Trump supporters, they 
feel marginalized by the sort of 
progressive ethos on campus, 
but on the other hand, we have 
students of color or of different 
sexual preference. We don’t want 
to equate the fact that you voted 
for Trump or you feel unwelcome 
on campus with the legacy of 
racism and sexism on campus.”

Katie Slajus, a freshman in 

the 
Residential 
College, 
also 

expressed her opinion on problems 
the community faces.

“Racism 
and 
general 

discrimination (are issues),” Slajus 
said. “I don’t really think the 
diversity, equity and inclusion is 
actually working.” 

The forum began with casual 

invitation for audience members 
to write down on posters their 
thoughts 
about 
topics 
like 

racism on campus, self-care and 
supporting marginalized students 
in the RC. After the posters, 
everyone was invited to select an 
issue to discuss further in small 
groups. After the small group 
meetings, everyone reconvened 
for a larger discussion.

Camilla 
Lizundia, 
also 
a 

freshman 
Residential 
College 

student, hoped the forum would 
foster more relationships in the 
future.

“I hope to gain more insight 

to how we, as a community, can 
better improve the relationships 
between other people in the RC, 
and how that can correlate to 
the rest of the campus as well,” 
Lizundia said.

FORUM

chapter of College Republicans, 
wrote in an email interview he 
was upset by the lack of action 
taken by the University. 

According 
to 
Zalamea, 

Amanda 
Delekta, 
political 

director for College Republicans, 
reached 
out 
to 
University 

President 
Mark 
Schlissel 

when the first accusation was 
proven false and was told the 
action taken by the AAPD was 
sufficient.

“These 
false 
accusations 

were once used as a rallying 
cry against conservatives and 
against 
President 
Trump,” 

Zalamea wrote. “The University 
has a duty to its students to keep 
them safe. And given all the 
fear these accusations caused, I 
believe the University must do 
its best in notifying all students 
about the true deceptive nature 
of these allegations.”

Zalamea 
believes 
people 

involved with falsely reporting 
the 
crimes 
should 
receive 

consequences.

“There should be real legal 

consequences for anyone who 
files 
a 
false 
police 
report, 

especially since these serious 
allegations incited so much fear 
in the community,” Zalamea 
wrote.

On social media, critiques of 

the false reports spiraled into 
personal attacks on the alleged 
victims. 

Many marginalized students 

subsequently fear future hate 
crimes will be immediately 
discredited, and hold heightened 
concerns 
about 
polarization 

on campus. LSA sophomore 
Alyiah Al-Bonijim, one of the 
organizers of Halfway Hijabi: 
Hijabi Monologues, was upset 
by the false reports as well. She 
believes, however, the type of 
mentality expressed by critics 
will perpetuate the idea that 

all reported hate crimes are 
fabricated.

“Putting too much attention 

on these two false reports, out 
of the many reported following 
and preceding the election, 
works to push forward this idea 
that hate crimes as a whole are 
fake,” Al-Bonijim wrote in an 
email interview. “Truthfully, 
reluctance has come from fear 
of not being believed later on in 
the future if something like this 
does occur.”

Fatima 
Haidar, 
another 

Hijabi Monologues organizer, 
expressed concern regarding 
the release of the updates from 
the AAPD.

“Sometimes 
the 
kind 
of 

decisions that the police make 
in terms of saying that this is 
false information is going to 
lead to a confirmation bias on 
either side,” she said. “So it may 
lead to people who had already 
perceived these minorities as 
weak or sensitive to continue 
with that idea and say yeah they 
are liars too. It’s not helping the 
situation.”

Haidar 
and 
Al-Bonijim 

acknowledged the significant 
community response to the 
initial reports as well as the 
response from the Division of 
Public Safety and Security, but 
had some concerns regarding 
their impact. The determination 
that the reports were fabricated 
upset Al-Bonijim, particularly 
because 
of 
the 
powerful 

response she and the Muslim 
community received from the 
campus community.

“I was upset that so many 

amazing 
people 
worked 
so 

hard to provide support for the 
Muslim community and could 
only imagine how they feel about 
using their valuable time to 
support us,” Al-Bonijim wrote.

However, she went on to say 

that despite the large response, 
the ties formed could always be 
strengthened.

“Yes, 
support 
has 
been 

large, but it can be larger,” 
Al-Bonijm wrote. “It can also 
be more intersectional and less 
temporary. 
Support 
always 

comes in masses when a huge 
incident occurs, but I want to 
push for this to last past the 
boundaries of a trend.”

Haidar suggested that DPSS 

pursue a more preventative 
approach 
to 
hate 
crimes, 

particularly in the face of these 
false reports.

“It’s really the lack of action or 

emphasis on certain things that 
might lead to a progression of 
problems that could be avoided,” 
Haidar said. “I think they should 
be doing everything they can 
to prevent hate crimes not just 
respond to them.”

University Counseling and 

Psychological 
Services 
has 

responded to tension on campus 
by recognizing the increased 
need for a safe place where 
students can receive support. 
CAPS has added a page to its 
website, “Navigating a Complex 
World: Current Events That 
Impact Students,” to outline 
its commitment to providing 
culturally competent services.

Sheryl Kelly, coordinator of 

CAPS’s 
Inclusive 
Excellence 

Initiatives, described some of the 
resources CAPS offers students 
who have concerns about the 
campus climate, including walk-
in times, appointments and 
after-hours services. Students 
are also able to request to speak 
to someone from a particular 
social demographic if that makes 
them feel more comfortable. 
Kelly also noted there has been 
an increase in students who 
come in to talk about concerns 
regarding the campus climate.

“A lot of students are being 

impacted by current events, so 
when they come in, I ask how 
they are doing in the current 
campus climate,” Kelly said. 
“We have many students that 
come in who specifically identify 
that as a problem.”

HATE CRIMES

automatically going to reduce or 
impact the quality of care.”

Meade provided examples of 

problems and possible solutions, 
such as the issues of low literacy 
with the implementation of video 
health instructions, executive 
dysfunction with concrete and 
practical support and disabled 
children with appointments and 
clinics. These are, Meade said, 
only a few of the changes we 
can make to reduce health-care 
disparities for the disabled.

The 
Patient 
Protection 

and 
Affordable 
Care 
Act, 

most 
commonly 
known 
as 

the Affordable Care Act or 
Obamacare, 
was 
passed 
by 

Congress in 2010. The act tried 
to reduce health disparities for 
the disabled by gathering more 
data on the issue and increasing 
health-care-provider 
training. 

However, the current House 
and Senate have already voted to 
approve new budget resolutions 
that will make it easier for the 
Trump administration to repeal 
the ACA in the future.

Meade said she is shocked 

many health-care providers still 
do not work toward improving 
general 
comfort 
for 
their 

disabled patients.

“One 
of 
the 
things 
that 

continues to shock me is (the 

lack of) access to a wheelchair-
accessible 
scale,” 
she 
said. 

“These are some of the basic 
factors that we need to think 
… how we make this as easy as 
possible.”

In addition to scales, Meade 

said 
people 
must 
actively 

improve current environments 
to assist disabled individuals in 
any way they can.

“We can consciously create 

environments,” she said. “Just as 
we create environments that are 
inviting based on age or gender, 
we can do the same (here). We 
can think about not only the 
accessibility of doors, the height 
of the table, the way we interact. 
We can think about the signage, 
the themes of use. We can think 
about the pictures that are up 
there.”

In her research, Meade said 

she doesn’t want to merely 
conduct research, write a paper 
and be done with the topic. She 
aims to use her data to improve 
knowledge 
and 
measurable 

action to lessen health-care 
disparities for the disabled.

“Thinking about creating or 

adapting clinical services based 
on research evidence, making 
sure if you’re collecting data, it’s 
for a reason and how is this going 
to change our practice,” she said.

Meade 
concluded 
by 

emphasizing knowing how to 
care for and support disabled 
individuals 
is 
something 

everyone should undertake.

“Most people are touched 

some 
way 
by 
disabilities,” 

she said. “They have siblings, 
they have parents … so being 
aware of what’s involved, being 
knowledgeable about the factors 
… and just addressing them and 
being respectful. Not assuming 
that we know everything makes 
a difference.”

Public Health student Suzie 

Genyk, president of IHSO, said 
the group invited Meade to IHSO 
to speak because of her inclusion 
of many medical disciplines in 
her research.

“The group of members we 

have with IHSO, it’s students 
from all the different health 
schools,” she said. “We try to 
have different events to bring 
in different perspectives that 
they wouldn’t necessarily get in 
the classroom, and also to have 
conversations 
with 
students 

outside of their normal cohort.”

Pharmacy 
student 
Chris 

German said Meade’s statements 
shed a light on health-care 
controversies and ways we can 
improve life for people with 
disabilities.

“She … pointed out things 

that the health-care system 
could do better in order to make 
sure we recognize people with 
disabilities as individuals and 
to make sure that they get the 
kind of care people without 
disabilities even get,” he said.

“The idea with the healthy 

relationships dialogues is that 
the majority of sexual assaults 
that happen on campus happen 
to 
individuals 
from 
non-

dominant groups, and their 
stories usually don’t really get 
shared or spoken about,” he 
said.

Following this resolution, 

a resolution to help fund the 
SAPAC Survivor Care Fund 
also 
passed. 
This 
fund 
is 

designed to help students who 
are victims of sexual assault 
by providing them with hotel 
rooms, new door locks in the 
case that the victim still lives 
with the perpetrator, and other 
necessities such as food and 
clothing.

LSA SG has sponsored the 

Survivor Care Fund in the past. 

Wednesday night, the body 
approved the continuation of 
allocating funds and a donation 
of $1,000.

Rep. Allison Berry, an LSA 

sophomore, 
explained 
the 

importance of the resolutions 
toward 
SAPAC, 
specifically 

when 
providing 
necessities 

for those students who have 
experienced sexual assault or 
other forms of harassment.

“I think that the meeting 

today really added a human 
component that we kind of 
missed 
when 
we’re 
sitting 

in this room just voting on 
a number,” she said. “Every 
penny has been spent from 
this fund every semester since 
they’ve had it, so there’s always 
a need, and if it’s there it will 
be spent.”

Representatives 
also 

discussed a resolution to turn 
the current Transfer Student 
Initiatives Task Force into 

a full committee to improve 
resources, and allow for a 
smoother 
integration 
for 

transfer 
students 
into 
the 

University of Michigan.

LSA senior Reid Klootwyk 

said the task force currently 
works 
on 
a 
per-semester 

basis and because it is not a 
continuous project, is unable 
to 
fully 
provide 
resources 

necessary for transfer students.

“The 
transfer 
student 

resolution 
would 
create 
a 

fully formed committee in 
LSA Student Government that 
will continue to last and make 
change for transfer students,” 
he said. “We’ve found that the 
projects that we’re working 
on, the momentum that we 
currently 
have, 
needs 
to 

continue on beyond a semester.”

This specific resolution falls 

under the category of new 
business, and was tabled to be 
voted on next week.

S

o… what do you do?”

I get asked this question 

everywhere I go. It is 

the 
first 
thing 
on 

the 
agenda 
when 

meeting new people, 
whether 
it’s 
your 

neighbors at a garage 
sale or recruiters at 
an event. Answering 
this question is tricky. 
Though no one says 
it so directly, it is 
likely that people will 
scrutinize and judge 
your response. This 
question carries so much weight 
that it is even considered the 
life’s most dangerous question, 
according to The Minimalists. 
So, how do we get it right? How 
can we fascinate people in just a 
few seconds?

I never knew how to respond 

but I always knew how not to. I’ve 
realized that most people have 
a limited way of answering this 
question. If you observe closely, 
people sound like a recorded 
resume. Press “play” and they will 
spew out their job titles and all their 
projects and accomplishments. 
They assume that being impressive 
means talking technical. But no 
one likes a robot. If you bombard 
people with details, you lose them.

When it comes to the topic 

of effective speaking, there are 
countless self-help books and 
YouTube videos on how to become 
more charismatic and how to 
be more memorable. Some are 
convinced that we must maintain 
eye contact and talk slowly; others 
maintain that we must turn 
anxiety into excitement. This 
is all great advice — but there’s 
one other factor that is often 
overlooked. My own view is that of 
James Whittaker, a distinguished 
engineer from Microsoft: that 
storytelling is, in fact, the secret to 
turning this dreadful question into 
a moment of fascination.

In fact, a study from Princeton 

University 
finds 
that 
stories 

synchronize our brains — the same 

brain regions activate 
in both the speaker 
and listener when we 
tell a story. Stories 
are 
powerful 
and 

memorable 
because 

we can relate to them. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Here’s 
how 

Whittaker 
put 

storytelling 
into 

practice. 
Whittaker 

met Bill Gates for 
the first time at a 

conference full of overachievers. 
Desperate 
to 
get 
a 
moment 

with Gates, a guy from Cornell 
boasted about his expertise in 
machine-learning and another 
guy from Stanford talked big about 
computer vision. But their rhetoric 
worked against them. Whittaker 
examined their interactions only 
to find that Gates was bored out of 
his mind.

So what did Whittaker do 

differently so that one of the 
world’s most influential people 
held on to his hand and didn’t 
let go?

“Mr. Gates, I test software, 

because a computer on every 
desk and in every home that 
doesn’t work is no contribution 
to humanity, sir,” Whittaker said. 
How brilliant. Not only did he tell 
a story, he actually used Gates’s 
own story to connect with him. 
“A computer on every desk and 
in every home” was Microsoft’s 
motto at the time.

So if we love stories, why don’t 

we tell more of them? It is because 
we tend to dismiss small talk as an 
opportunity to connect. Yes, we’ve 
all been there. The uncomfortable 
silences in elevators and waiting 
rooms, taking out cell phones to 
avoid eye contact.

Talking 
to 
strangers 
is 

uncomfortable. As Laurie Helgoe, 
author of “Introvert Power: Why 

Your Inner Life is Your Hidden 
Strength,” writes in her book, “We 
hate small talk because we hate the 
barrier it creates between people.”

Small talk is also often looked 

down upon. A friend wrote in 
my high school yearbook, “Small 
talk is for small people, and that 
stuff is not for you.” In making 
this comment, he meant that I’m 
a big and imaginative person who 
shouldn’t settle for less. But what 
he also implied here is that small 
talk is insignificant.

But here’s what people may 

overlook: All conversations and 
relationships do start small, and 
taking these moments to share 
stories is where fascinating and 
boring people differ.

By no means am I suggesting 

you to be someone you’re not. You 
don’t have to change who you 
are. In fact, “You have to become 
more of who you are,” says Sally 
Hogshead, creator of Fascination 
Personality test. We are all born 
fascinating — we just have to 
unlearn how to be boring.

Break out of your scripted 

responses. Break out of your already 
prepared conversations. Start out 
your next presentation with a story. 
Remind people in the elevator 
about the first time you got stuck in 
one. Ask the person standing next 
to you in Starbucks line what their 
favorite drink is and why. People 
want to connect. And who knows? 
From these interactions, you might 
capture someone’s attention who 
could be your next employer, best 
friend or even the love of your life. 
(I certainly did.)

So, what do you do? Well I eat, I 

work out (occasionally) and I type 
really loudly on keyboards. And I 
also write stories about how people 
can become more fascinating. 
What is your story?

I 

spent this weekend skiing 
in 
northern 
Michigan 

while basking in the warm 

weather. Skiing with 
the sun beating down 
on my face as the 
temperature hit the 
50s would have been 
perfect if it hadn’t been 
February. It was still an 
enjoyable experience, 
don’t get me wrong, 
but the looming threat 
of 
global 
warming 

intruded 
on 
my 

happiness. I grew up 
in northern Michigan 
and spent my childhood 
exploring the slopes. I started skiing 
around the age of 3 and started 
snowboarding 
and 
ski-racing 

around the age of 12. These hills 
defined my youth, and I couldn’t 
help but fear my kids would never 
be able to have that experience. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

This 
might 
seem 
overly 

dramatic or, if you don’t believe 
in climate change, absolutely 
ridiculous. 
Publications 
like 

Breitbart, after all, will have you 
believe that the warming of the 
earth’s climate can be disproved 
by lower temperatures in parts 
of the world. Breitbart also 
claims that climate change is a 
hoax against taxpayers. These 
views aren’t exclusive to far-
right publications, however. A 
study published in the journal, 
Public Understanding of Science, 
shows that the more Americans 
use conservative media, like Fox 
News, the less they trust scientists 
and the less certain they are that 
global warming is happening. 
Our very own president once 
tweeted, “The concept of global 
warming was created by and for 
the Chinese in order to make U.S. 
manufacturing non-competitive.”

Well, 
if 
China 
fabricated 

climate change, it sure is putting 
its money where its mouth 
is. 
China’s 
National 
Energy 

Administration announced plans 
to spend $361 billion on renewable 
power sources through 2020. 
China is also halfway through 
a plan to spend $88 billion on 
ultra-high-voltage direct-current 
connectors to stabilize their 
energy supply and better supply 
renewable energy to cities and 

industrial centers. Wow, they 
sure fell for that one!

China, 
though, 
isn’t 
the 

only 
country 
that 

has picked on the 
scientific 
consensus. 

The European Union 
aims 
to 
spend 
at 

least 20 percent of its 
budget through 2020 
on 
protecting 
the 

climate. Additionally, 
the EU, along with 
192 
states, 
signed 

on 
to 
the 
Paris 

Climate 
Agreement, 

committing 
to 

lowering 
global 
CO2 

emissions 
and 
mitigate 
the 

effects of climate change. Those 
schmucks! Oh, wait, no, the United 
States is one of the signatories. Mr. 
Trump has said he would cancel 
the climate deal, a commitment 
that brought him sharp criticism 
from 375 scientists, including 30 
Nobel Prize winners. Those hacks?

But even when not considered 

to be a conspiratorial hoax, 
climate change is often considered 
an issue at odds with U.S. economic 
interests. The narrative goes that, 
yes, climate change is happening, 
but fighting climate change would 
put the United States at an economic 
disadvantage, so the environment 
must be put on the back burner 
for now. But with so many other 
countries 
making 
substantial 

investments in sustainable energy, 
is refusing to address the need for 
renewable resources really the best 
course of action for our country? Is 
Trump’s promise to “put the coal 
country back to work” a practical 
economic strategy?

If I had to guess, clinging to 

the past and burying our heads 
in the sand probably isn’t the 
best way to promote economic 
growth and stay economically 
competitive as a country. It’s time 
to embrace that economic growth 
and environmental sustainability 
are not diametrically opposed. 
Sustainable energy is the future, 
and pretending otherwise might 
be profitable in the short term. 
In the long run, though, failing 
to invest in sustainable energy 
and fight against climate change 
will bring about self-inflicted 
economic hardship. Instead of 

maintaining an oil pipeline that 
is corroding, losing coating and 
putting Michigan’s water and 
shorelines in danger, Michigan 
should invest in energy sources 
that don’t threaten our tourism 
industry and natural beauty. This 
shouldn’t be controversial or 
partisan: it’s common sense and 
it’s in all of our best interests.

So, 
if 
melting 
snow 
and 

childhoods without skiing don’t 
tug on your heartstrings enough, 
consider the economic argument 
for embracing the industries of the 
future. And if that’s not enough 
for you, consider the rising 
sea levels due to ice melting. 
Florida might be one of the more 
bizarre states, but it would be a 
bit of a bummer if it was entirely 
submerged in water.

With all this pressing need for 

progress, though, our country 
seems to be moving backward. Last 
Friday, Scott Pruitt was confirmed 
to 
lead 
the 
Environmental 

Protection Agency, despite the 
fact that he has built a career 
of suing the EPA to block its 
environmental regulations. Pruitt 
has acknowledged the existence of 
human-caused climate change, but 
his past suggests that he would do 
little to prevent the consequences 
of climate change. He claims his 
fights against the EPA are merely 
against government overreach. 
But if the head of the EPA doesn’t 
think the government should fight 
climate change, who will be able 
to take up the fight to preserve our 
country and our prosperity?

We might be about to find 

out. 
The 
day 
after 
Pruitt’s 

confirmation, hundreds gathered 
in Ann Arbor to march for climate 
change action in the Citizens’ 
Climate Rally. On April 29, the 
People’s 
Climate 
Movement 

will bring people to march for 
the cause in Washington D.C. 
and around the country. These 
marchers aren’t just tree-hugging 
hippies whom we can afford 
to ignore — they are scientists, 
advocates and, ultimately, people 
who care about our Earth, our 
economy and our future. We

isclaimer: As an adoptee, 
I consider the family 
I live with in America 

as my family and I consider my 
biological Vietnamese family as 
my birth family. 

“Gotcha Day” has been a day 

that has been met with warmth 
and love from my parents. It’s 
a day that is celebrated when 
adopted parents finally get their 
adopted child. I was six months 
old when I was got from Thai 
Binh, Vietnam. My name before 
then was Nguyen Đai Duong. I 
was got on Feb. 9 and not too long 
after, my name would be Adam 
Yeager Brodnax.

Why 
is 
“gotcha” 
so 

cringeworthy?

Articulating the word gotcha 

feels like I’m on my iPhone 
with “Pokemon Go” opened 
as I frantically flick my finger 
across the screen trying to catch 
a Snorlax. My typical uses of 
the word “gotcha” are when I’m 
on my tippy toes reaching for a 
glass on the top shelf, or when 
I catch a firefly flickering in my 
aunt’s backyard.

The nomenclature of this 

day is problematic in itself. 
Margaret Schwartz suggested 
the 
day, 
“International 

Gotcha Day,” in 2005 in her 
book “The Pumpkin Patch: A 
Single Woman’s International 
Adoption 
Journey.” 
Though 

with good sentiment, the name 
“Gotcha Day” celebrates the 
beginnings of a family that is 
ultimately insensitive toward the 
circumstances of many children 
who are involuntarily taken from 
their ancestral threads as a door 
closes behind them.

The 
word, 
“gotcha,” 
has 

multiple definitions, synonyms 
and connotations that don’t 
encompass what being adopted 
means to me. The online Oxford 
Dictionary defines “gotcha” as 
“a sudden unforeseen problem.” 
Merriam-Webster 
defines 

“gotcha” as “an unexpected 
usually disconcerting challenge, 
revelation, or catch.” So using 
the term “gotcha” to celebrate 
the adoption of a child seems a 
bit off, right? It is not so simple 
to reduce the trying process of 

adoption to the word “gotcha.” 
It requires extensive paperwork 
for the adopting family that can 
take a while to get through all 
while another family is going 
through the process of giving 
up one of their own. When can 
you last remember celebrating a 
loved one or being at a wedding 
where a spouse celebrated their 
significant other with “I gotcha?”

The flipside
With adoption, there are two 

distinct worlds that only ever 
collide in one singular body. 
My birth family never met my 
adopted family. This makes 
me the physical and emotional 
embodiment that bridges these 
two worlds together. To one 
world, the joy that accompanies 
the addition of a child should be 
celebrated. It’s a beginning — 
that part is unequivocally true. 
The struggles and tribulations 
of legally adopting are a burden. 
The relief of that burden comes 
in the form of the child finally 
arriving. The joy and happiness 
that was brought to my parents 
is something that should be 
acknowledged, 
because 
they 

put their hearts into ensuring I 
grew up happy and healthy.

Yet, what is so often forgotten 

is that what’s left behind is a 
mother wondering where in the 
hell her kid landed. The joy of 
the legal addition to a new family 
comes at the expense of plucking 
a child away from a pair of arms 
— the emotional abandonment of 
one of her own. While there are 
many reasons a family may give 
up their child, I cannot move 
myself to imagine that my birth 
family’s decision to give me away 
came without pain.

So let’s abandon the word 

“gotcha”

The process of deciding that 

you can’t afford another life 
cannot be trivial. People are so 
easily reduced to dollar signs. 
For my American parents, they 
had to pay fees and services 
to legally adopt me. My birth 
family had to decide financially 
that they couldn’t afford me. 
This cold, inhumane concept 
of commodification envelopes 
me with willowing pain and 
unsettling 
frustration. 
Child 

adoption is not PetSmart — you 
do not walk in, pick me off the 
shelf, slap a barcode on my body 

and check-out. You do not got 
me. 

In a process filled with so 

many 
conflicting 
emotions, 

we 
should 
not 
reduce 
the 

summation of the adoption 
process to a word as predatory 
and as acquisitional as “gotcha.” 
This 
is 
a 
day 
filled 
with 

gratitude, regret, love, longing, 
heartache 
and 
dissonance. 

“Gotcha Day” is a day where I 
am filled with so many questions 
for my birth family surrounding 
my adoption. Why was I given 
up? Do I look like any of my 
siblings? Are they healthy? Are 
my parents still alive? I have 
no photos of my birth family, 
so for me, I struggle to imagine 
what my life could have been. 
I don’t know if I look more like 
my dad or my mom, and that’s 
something that hollows my 
heart. But, adoption should be 
a time of elation for these new 
moms and new fathers. It’s 
the beginnings of a family that 
couldn’t have existed without 
tribulation. We rightfully should 
celebrate it, but we should be 
conscious of the pain. We must 
be mindful that the feeling of 
abandonment, at whatever age, 
is breaking. Whatever bond that 
child had developed with their 
birth parents is ripped away 
slowly and at the price of their 
shaky readiness to let go. 

This day, which is filled 

with 
polarizing 
emotions, 

must acknowledge just that. 
It must encompass the weight 
of the birth family’s loss while 
relishing in the elation of the 
family who just welcomed their 
new child. To the critics who 
will not validate my pain for this 
day without a solution, I will 
give you a solution. Of the many 
proposals out there, the one 
that resonates most is “Family 
Day” because it considers both 
families. This name includes 
both the Brodnax family and it 
includes the Duong family and 
recognizes my belonging to 
both. It is inclusive to the two 
strings of yarn that have been 
woven through generation after 
generation into the infused 
thread I am today.

Let’s abandon the word “Gotcha”

‘Fist Fight’ falls short

Despite a star-studded cast, Warner Bros. latest film disappoints

“Fist Fight” is a movie about 

two teachers who go ahead 
and fight each other because 
that is something you wouldn’t 
expect two teachers to do. And 
if there is one thing that “Fist 
Fight” thinks is funny, it’s 
teachers doing things teachers 
wouldn’t normally do.

“Look, 
that 

teacher 
does 

drugs!” 
“Look, 

that 
teacher 

swears 
a 
lot!” 

“Look, 
that 

teacher 
is 
a 

potentially 
psychotic killer!” 
“Look, that teacher is Ice 
Cube!” This list represents a 
comprehensive compilation of 
every single joke in the entire 
hour and thirty-one-minute 
ordeal that is “Fist Fight.”

While jokes like these are 

occasionally funny, it’s not 
the kind of humor on which 
to base an entire feature 
film. It’s a running joke, a 
bit. Ultimately, “Fist Fight” 
is just like the jokes it tells; 
sometimes it’ll get a laugh, but 
for the most part, it feels like 
a one-note sitcom episode that 
lasts ninety minutes instead of 
twenty.

“Fist 
Fight” 
is 
doubly 

disappointing considering the 
comedic pedigree of its cast. 
Charlie Day, the breakout star 
of FXX’s terrific “It’s Always 
Sunny in Philadelphia,” stars, 
squaring off against Ice Cube, 
who has turned in scene-
stealing comedic work in the 
“Jump Street” movies. The 
two are backed up by Tracy 
Morgan (“30 Rock”), Jillian 
Bell (“22 Jump Street”), and 
Kumail 
Nanjiani 
(“Silicon 

Valley”), as well as dramatic 
performers 
like 
Dean 

Norris (“Breaking Bad”) and 
Christina Hendricks (“Mad 
Men”).

This is an insane cast, and to 

their credit, they all do great 
work. Day acquits himself 
quite well as the straight 
man of the movie, though the 
manic energy that has made 
him the fan favorite character 
of “Sunny” inevitably shines 
through. Ice Cube plays the 
kind of “angry guy” role that 

he could do in 
his 
sleep 
by 

this 
point 
in 

his career, but 
he does it well 
enough 
that 

it’s hard to get 
too upset over. 
Arguably 
the 

biggest surprise in the cast is 
Norris, who portrays the high 
school’s put-upon principal, 
who seems like he is growing 
closer and closer to losing his 
mind as the story wears on. 
Like much of the cast, it’s a bit 
role, but Norris makes it one of 
the more memorable parts of 
the movie.

Still, with a cast this good, 

there 
should 
be 
material 

worthy of that talent, and 
there is little to none to be 
found in “Fist Fight.” Apart 
from the absolute dearth of 
any sort of wit—former Funny 
or Die writers Van Robichaux 
and 
Evan 
Susser 
fill 
the 

movie with as many F-bombs 
as possible and erroneously 
believe 
that 
counts 
as 

comedy—the 
film 
features 

the bane of modern R-rated 
comedies: the shoehorned in 
emotional B-story.

You know the one where the 

main character has to learn 
the value of friendship or the 
main character has to learn to 
believe in himself or the main 
character has to be a better 
employee. It’s the storyline 
where large swaths of people 

leave the theater to refill 
their popcorn or go to the 
bathroom because they know 
there will be nothing funny 
for the next five minutes. 
Here, “Fist Fight” proves to 
be the most economical kind 
of movie, as it crams three of 
these into itself for the price 
of one. Day’s character has 
to learn to be a better father 
and he has to learn to stand 

up for himself and he has to 
worry about his job. Not only 
do these function as a way to 
give the plot some illusion of 
stake, but it gives the writers a 
way to espouse the message of 
the film as much as possible: 
words matter.

And that is where “Fist 

Fight” falls shortest of all, 
because while it all but breaks 
the fourth wall to get its 
meaning across, everything 
that happen within the movie 
contradicts it. Words matter, 
but nothing the characters do 
has any consequences. Words 
matter, but do whatever you 
want, it’ll turn out okay. Words 
matter, just not our words. It 
is hypocritical in a way that is 
almost inspiring. If it felt like 
anyone but the cast had put 
any effort into it, “Fist Fight” 
might be salvageable, but it 
can’t escape its own idiotic 
duplicity and boring humor.

Serving up more than just food

As with most businesses, 

restaurants 
possess 
the 

ability to impact social and 
political change. Whether it’s 
by choosing to source their 
produce from local farmers 
or by taking a stand on recent 
anti-immigrant policies, the 
way restaurant owners choose 
to run their establishments has 
far-reaching effects on their 
communities and beyond.

In a recent profile, Detroit 

chef Kate Williams made clear 
her awareness of the cultural 
currency chefs and restaurants 
carry in driving food and dining 
trends across the country. This 
awareness motivates her use of 
whole animal preservation and 
local produce from Detroit’s 
urban farmers. In doing so, she 
hopes to infuse the national 
discourse 
surrounding 

culinary 
trends 
and 
food 

consumption 
with 

her propensity for 
sustainability 
and 

reducing food waste.

Among 
the 

increasing 
movements 
aimed at boosting 
sustainability 
and 

reducing waste is 
the 
farm-to-table 

movement 
— 
a 

trend 
that 
began 

in the early 1970 ’s 
and entered mainstream food 
culture a little over a decade 
ago. The movement benefits 
not only the environment and 
the economy but also improves 
and 
sustains 
the 
nation’s 

physical health. Williams is 
among an increasing number 
of chefs and restaurants that 
have taken to the movement. In 
addition to reducing business 
costs for restaurant owners, 
it helps local farmers and 
creates jobs — a key advantage 
for cities like Detroit, that are 
recovering 
from 
economic 

hardship.

This movement, and many 

others, are sparked by the 
actions of individual chefs. 
Their 
unique 
tastes 
and 

practices have the power to 
shape how food is made and 
consumed in our country. Not 

all trends and movements are 
rooted in culinary practices, 
however.

Recently, many restaurants 

took it upon themselves to 
support their local communities 
by 
championing 
immigrant 

workers — who make up over 
a quarter of the industry — 
and closing their doors on 
Thursday, February 16th in “A 
Day Without Immigrants.” The 
national movement, sparked 
by President Donald Trump’s 
recent, 
highly 
controversial 

anti-immigrant 
policies, 

sought to defend immigrants, 
who form the backbone of the 
restaurant industry.

In 
January, 
Sanctuary 

Restaurants 
was 
founded 

to 
protect 
employers 
and 

workers from becoming the 
targets of hate or harassment 
by educating them on their 

rights 
and 
calling 

on 
consumers 
to 

increase 
their 

awareness. 
The 

organization’s 
maxim is the belief 
that, 
“There’s 
a 

place at the table 
for everyone.” Over 
280 restaurants have 
already joined the 
movement, including 
Ann 
Arbor’s 

Zingerman’s 
Deli. 

The movement seeks to create 
inclusive dining environments 
and hold restaurant owners, 
workers 
and 
consumers 

responsible for fostering safe 
spaces and responding to the 
racism and discrimination that 
have permeated the national 
discourse 
surrounding 

immigrants. 
This 
type 
of 

response uses the particular 
position of restaurants in their 
community and the economy 
to make a political statement 
and to advance social change 
on a scale that extends far 
beyond their respective local 
environments.

On 
a 
small-scale 
level, 

restaurants serve a valuable 
role as cultural hubs, bringing 
together members of their 
communities and individuals 
from 
outside 
to 
share 
in 

unifying, common experiences. 
They 
exhibit 
a 
range 
of 

diverse 
cultural 
practices 

that 
introducer 
patrons 
to 

philosophies 
and 
practices 

they might not experience 
elsewhere. 
a 
fundamental 

and 
necessary 
aspect 
of 

communities 
across 
the 

nation. As cultural mainstays, 
restaurants are positioned to 
take the kind of stance that 
Sanctuary 
Restaurants 
and 

other movements advocate for 
to mobilize real change.

Restaurants 
play 
a 
vital 

role in their local business 
communities. Whether a hole-
in-the wall local joint, a small 
time food truck, or a high-
end dining spot, restaurants 
are 
pillars 
of 
their 
local 

communities and the nation’s 
overarching 
economic 
and 

cultural ecosystem. Drawing 
crowds 
from 
all 
over 
the 

world, they possess the ability 
to aggregate numerous and 
varied constituencies.

Even 
on 
a 
small 
scale, 

the way restaurant owners 
choose 
to 
present 
their 

businesses 
is 
reflective 
of 

attitudes 
of 
inclusion 
and 

social 
consciousness. 
In 

her 
interview, 
Williams 

expressed her desire to make 
her restaurant approachable 
to all, particularly to those 
deterred from certain price 
points. Be it simplified decor 
or a more affordable menu, 
this form of cultural and 
economic awareness strives to 
make dining a more equitable 
environment.

Though 
instability 
is 

common within the industry, 
with 
restaurants 
shuttering 

and failing to launch regularly, 
those 
with 
staying 
power 

have a profound impact on 
their communities and a clear 
expression of their unique 
cultural 
voice 
within 
the 

culinary landscape. It’s these 
kinds of establishments and 
culturally-savvy owners that 
create enduring spaces and 
practices 
that 
shape 
their 

communities in the long run 
and that ultimately shape who 
we are as consumers.

Goodrich Quality 16

SINGLE REVIEW

 
It’s not a surprise 

that Lana del Rey’s newest 
single is about love.
 
But instead of gravi-

tating towards the sensual, 
melancholy-heavy sound of 
2013’s Born To Die, “Love” 
is delicately suffused with 
nostalgia and sweeter, more 
tender emotions.
 
Lana swaps out the 

chorusing violins that fea-
tured prominently in both 
“Born to Die” and “Dark Par-
adise,” replacing them with 
a steady, gently bobbing beat 
and airy, rustling background 
noises, which emphasize the 
unhurried tone and dreamy 
atmosphere of the track. 
Wispy, ethereal electronics 
further add to the softness of 
the song overall.
 
Like most of her 

work, “Love” has a distinctly 
cinematic sound to it; it’s 
easy to picture it playing 
over a scene from the 2013 
film adaption of “The Great 

Gatsby,” which featured 
her “Young and Beautiful.” 
Something about the effort-
less breathiness of her voice 
as she reaches for higher tim-
bres and the candid, buoy-
ant innocence of the lyrics 
(“It doesn’t matter if I’m not 
enough / For the future or 
the things to come / ‘Cause 
I’m young and in love”) per-
fectly captures the essence 
of young love. Even if the 

listener hasn’t experienced it, 
“Love” encourages imagina-
tion, nudging us to let loose 
and take advantage of the 
possibilities available to us 
while we still can.
 
But “Love” isn’t 

merely about the freedom 
and naivete of the emotion; 

it’s also a song of admiration 
for those who are still able 
to experience love’s carefree 
nature.
 
“Look at you kids 

with your vintage music / 
Comin’ through satellites 
while cruisin’ / You’re part of 
the past, but now you’re the 
future,” Lana coos in the first 
stanza, a hint of motherly 
pride unmistakable in her 
voice.
 
Even as the piece 

builds into a sweeping cre-
scendo, it never loses any 
of the lush luminosity that 
keeps it fresh. At its most 
intense, the song glides with 
a sugary, carefree melodious-
ness — but at every end it’s 
purposed.

Passion Pit’s curveball

It’s been almost two years 

since 
the 
ever-changing, 

largely mysterious Passion Pit 
released their widely acclaimed 
third album Kindred. Besides 
a 
recent 
solo 

Christmas album 
from 
frontman 

Michael 
Angelakos, 
the 

band 
has 
been 

mostly 
silent. 

Over the past few days, the 
band slowly, unexpectedly put 
six tracks out through YouTube 
— utilizing the channel for 
Angelakos’s new company The 
Wishart Group. According to 
their new Twitter “moment,” 
the band seems primed for their 
newest release, Tremendous 
Sea of Love.

From these tracks, Passion 

Pit’s brand of indie-pop is as 
stunning as ever. The six songs 
traverse unique soundscapes, 
some 
instrumental 
and 

some brightly painted with 
Angelakos’s beautiful falsetto.

The 
band 
tones 
down 

their sound with “You Have 
the Right” — reminiscent of 
“Dancing on the Grave” and 
“Constant 
Conversations” 

from previous albums — but 
they pick the tempo back up 
to their usual brand on “I’m 
Perfect,” with the resounding 
chorus, “Tell me I’m so damn 

perfect.” 
On 
instrumental 

“Inner Dialogue,” the band 
plays with a vibrant array of 
sounds, the melody focusing 
on shrill synth and punctuated 
with 
otherworldly 
bass 

undertones, pushing the band 
toward the highly produced 
end of their talents. With this 

new music, we 
find Passion Pit 
spanning familiar 
atmospheres 
from 
their 

previous 
releases, 
while 

still 
pushing 
their 
sound 

slightly further.

The most profound quality 

of Passion Pit’s music is the 
cohesion of their albums. Each 
offers a distinct vibe and subtle 
motif that drive the record 
from front to back, a streak that 
started with Angelakos’s first 
EP Chunk of Change. There’s 
the explosive pop of Manners 
and 
the 
hazy 
undertones 

of Gossamer, each of which 
display strong differentiation 
between records. That being 
said, this collection — if it can 
even be called a collection — 
lacks the usual assuredness 
once 
granted 
by 
their 

enigmatic nature. All we have 
left is the mantra on “Hey K”: 
“Love is the answer and the 
one design / such a simple 
design, holy architecture.” It’s 
also newly added to the band’s 
Twitter bio.

Angelakos’s 
increased 

social media presence shows 
his 
disdain 
for 
pervasive 

capitalism 
in 
the 
music 

industry (especially in regard 
to large festivals) and hints at a 
rebranding on his part and the 
band’s. They want to change 
the way music is available to 
fans.

Two days ago, Angelakos 

tweeted 
from 
the 
band’s 

account: 
“artist 
randomly 

calls out promoter regarding 
an injustice. promoter spews 
bs as a ‘statement’ framing 
artist as liar. artist rolls eyes.” 
He followed that up with a 
stream of tweets about lack of 
artist autonomy in the music 
industry. In his sarcasm and 
indignation, 
it 
seems 
the 

band 
purposefully 
avoided 

capitalistic 
involvement 
in 

the crafty delivery of the new 
tunes coupled into a Twitter 
moment.

This cryptic activity begs 

one question — what does the 
band have planned? With a 
sampling of new music and 
social media activism, but few 
concrete details on their future, 
we’re 
left 
in 
anticipation. 

What is the meaning behind 
Tremendous Sea of Love? If 
Angelakos’s online statements 
are any indication, he has some 
big plans up his sleeve: “Artists 
are powerful, they’re taught 
the opposite. this is going to 
be an interesting few years. 
support artists and watch what 
happens.”

‘Chef’ enters third season

I fucking love watching 

other people’s food. Other 
people making it, other people 
eating 
it, 
Gordon 
Ramsay 

throwing it across the kitchen 
— whatever I’m watching, I’m 
here for it. There’s something 
elemental, 
visceral, 
almost 

primal 
about 
a 

high-definition 
camera capturing 
a 
knife 
mid-

chiffonade, 
or 

the 
crackling 

sear of a steak 
laid down (away from you) 
into a hot skillet, or even the 
professionally trained hand 
trivially beating a few eggs in 
a glass bowl.

At this point, though, the 

current wave of “food porn” 
programming is the easiest 
possible 
target 
for 
satire. 

(It’s a wonder it took so long 
for “Documentary Now!” to 
produce its famous “Juan Likes 
Rice and Chicken” episode.) 
Indeed, some of the videos 
you can find on YouTube 
of celebrity chefs veer into 
outright 
self-parody. 
But 

whatever the current cultural 
backlash to foodie culture is 
— and, believe me, I’m here 
for that, too — “Chef’s Table” 
remains a staunchly engaging 
program, often interested less 
in actual content than a purely 
aesthetic overwhelming of the 
senses.

And how overwhelming it is! 

Artful lighting, slow-motion 

shots, raucously overbearing 
classical 
scores, 
heartfelt 

testimonials 
from 
“food 

scholars” — it’s all still there, 
and it’s all still eye-rollingly 
pretentious, depending on who 
you ask. But as pure sensory 
experience, “Chef’s Table” is 
unmatched, inimitable. Even 
in its third season (“Chef’s 
Table: France” is technically 
considered a spin-off), creator 

David 
Gelb’s 

(“Jiro 
Dreams 

of Sushi”) series 
stirs something 
in the soul, some 
deeply 
buried 

desire to create. 

It’s enough to suck you deep 
into your 13-inch Macbook 
Pro’s full screen, only to be 
taken out moments later by 
earnestly delivered lines like: 
“Soy sauce is eternal. It is life 
itself.”

Of course, none of these 

profiled chefs are particularly 
accessible 
for 
the 
average 

Netflix 
consumer. 
Jeong 

Kwan, profiled in the third 
season premiere, is a Buddhist 
nun at a hermitage in South 
Korea whose life’s purpose, 
it seems, is to cook “temple 
food;” 
the 
second 
episode 

focuses on Vladimir Mukhin, 
a Russian chef whose Moscow 
restaurant White Rabbit is at 
the vanguard of the country’s 
culinary 
renaissance; 
the 

famous and highly influential 
Nancy Silverton is featured, 
too, 
with 
particular 
focus 

given to her borderline manic 
obsession with bread.

But the show’s new season 

should be commended, if not 
for a diversity of pricing, then 
for a wider scope of global 
cuisines. Kwan’s manipulation 
of 
ingredients 
is 
utterly 

fascinating 
and 
beautifully 

rendered, and all the more 
impressive considering her diet 
eschews all meat and dairy. 
Mukhin’s episode doubles as 
an illuminating bit of cultural 
anthropology, as his growth 
as a chef is intertwined with 
a modern history of Soviet 
Russia and some of its lesser 
known effects.

Yet 
these 
narratives 

ultimately play second fiddle 
to what is, at a base level, 
“Chef’s 
Table” 
’s 
peerless 

visual mastery. Blessed with 
Netflix’s 
generously 
high 

production values, Gelb has 
perfected the art form—and, 
truly, food television deserves 
its own categorization now. 
What 
seemed 
fresh 
and 

energizing in “Jiro Dreams of 
Sushi” has come to the logical 
end of its aesthetic evolution: 
The way we capture food on 
screen has been irrevocably 
altered, and for the better. 
It’s a niche and somewhat 
culturally elitist sphere, to 
be sure, but taken solely at its 
artful merits, “Chef’s Table” 
has become the paragon of 
America’s 
obsession 
with 

food. One can quibble, as I 
often do, that other programs 
provide 
a 
more 
enriching 

experience 
(see: 
Anthony 

Bourdain’s “Parts Unknown”), 
but for what it is and what it 
has become, “Chef’s Table” is 
without an equal.

Gucci finds new territory

What praise can I award 

Alessandro Michele, Creative 
Director of Gucci, that has not 
already already been given?

The 
label’s 
FW 
2017 

collection, 
The 
Alchemist 

Garden, features a medley of 
characteristically 
flamboyant 

pieces for both women and 
men (Michele would probably 
scoff if he read this; gender-
based clothing is so Tom Ford-
era). But this time around, 
something new arose among 
the feathers and florals: Gucci 
found its political voice in the 
argument that our world is 
reverting to its occasionally 
romantic, 
though 
generally 

problematic, roots.

From 
the 
minute 
this 

season’s 
invitations 
leaked, 

it was evident that Gucci 
had 
something 
especially 

intense up its sleeve. Guests 
were 
summoned 
via 
fully-

functioning 
vinyl 
records 

whose covers read, “What are 

we going to do with all this 
future?” 
in 
the 
trademark 

trembly lettering of artist Coco 
Capitán. Should they find the 
nerve to place it on a turntable, 
those lucky few would hear 
musician 
Florence 
Welch 

reciting the works of William 
Blake, followed by an excerpt 
of Jane Austen’s Persuasion 
read by rapper A$AP Rocky. 
The invites’ juxtaposition of 
the old-fashioned with the 
contemporary 
functioned 

as a preliminary warning to 
showgoers, 
reminding 
them 

that no matter how far we 
advance, history is bound to 
repeat itself.

I cannot forget myself: A 

fashion show, particularly a 
Gucci fashion show, is about 
the clothes. This time around, 
models 
paraded 
through 
a 

glass tube donning the typical 
pattern clashes along with a 
spray of logo-heavy accessories 
(Gucci sweatband, anyone?). 
Futuristic mesh masks, ’80s 
pop star sunnies and nostalgic 
knit earflap hats reinforced the 
collision of the past and future. 

All appeared well and good and 
apolitical until model number 
69 strode down the runway, 
sporting a cut-up vintage tee 
featuring 
some 
incoherent 

combination of words written 
Capitán’s 
shaky 
script. 
A 

similar 
shirt 
reappeared 

several looks later, this time 
clearly donning the phrase: 
“Common sense is not that 
common.” The remainder of the 
collection went about business 
as usual, but one could not view 
it without wondering about that 
second tee.

Of the 120 luxurious looks 

Michele sent down the runway, 
what 
will 
be 
remembered 

most are the invitation and 
one tattered, defaced scrap of 
cotton, an artifact inscribed 
with modern wisdom. This 
season, 
Gucci 
pleased 
its 

regulars, while unabashedly 
diving into new, yet necessary, 
territory.

“Can’t 
repeat 
the 
past?” 

Alessandro chuckles from the 
indoor greenhouse of his Milan 
penthouse, “Why of course you 
can!”

Michigan still winless after loss to the Fighting Irish

After five minutes of relentless 

attack to begin the game, No. 
8 
Notre 
Dame 
scored 
two 

consecutive goals in the next two 
minutes to take an early 2-0 lead.

Senior attacker Tess Korten, 

however, 
quickly 
answered 

for 
the 
Michigan 
women’s 

lacrosse team. She served as the 
playmaker for the Wolverines, 
creating more open shots for her 
teammates.

Still trailing by one, Michigan 

again found help from one of its 
seniors, Allie Breitfeller. The 
attacker caught a pass from 
Korten while cutting right and 
took a turnaround shot within 
the arc for her first goal of the 
season. Her goal tied the game 
at 2-2, shifting the momentum in 
favor of the Wolverines.

Using the momentum to its 

advantage, the Wolverines played 
grittier defense, drawing four 
fouls and two turnovers within 
six minutes. The defense caused 
key plays that allowed a free 
position attempt for Michigan. 
Senior midfielder Anna Schueler 
assisted fellow senior attacker 
Jess Angerman off the attempt 
for the first lead of the game, 3-2.

But 
despite 
the 
play 
of 

their seniors, Michigan (0-4) 
ultimately fell to Notre Dame 
(4-1), 12-5, in Michigan Stadium.

The Wolverines’ run came to 

a halt as Notre Dame called the 
first timeout of the game. Unable 
to deal with the adjustments 
from the timeout, such as double 
teams 
on 
Korten, 
Michigan 

entered the second half down 
by two after the Fighting Irish 
answered with a 3-0 run of their 
own.

“There were a couple of 

timeout calls from both ways, 
and that’s kind of just how 
lacrosse goes,” Breitfeller said. 
“There’s ebbs and flows, people 
will go on runs, and there are big 
stops. I think it just comes down 
to us when there is a really big 
stop on defense. We need to come 
back and finish on attack.”

Coming out from halftime, 

Schueler scored her first goal 
of the game from an assist by 
Korten. Cutting the lead down 
to one, Michigan switched to a 
more aggressive 
defense.

Despite 
the 

Wolverines’ 
increased focus, 
Notre 
Dame 

outscored 
Michigan seven 
to two in the 
second 
half, 

with 
Schueler 

scoring 
both 

goals 
for 
the 

Wolverines. It marked the third 
consecutive game that Schueler 
has led the team in scoring.

Michigan’s 
second-half 

struggles began with foul trouble. 
Though they were an issue for 
both teams in the first half — 
with Notre Dame and Michigan 
committing 18 and 14, respectively 

— Notre Dame improved while the 
Wolverines remained the same, 
committing 12 in the second half.

The fouls Michigan gave up 

led to five free-position attempts. 

Fortunately 
for 

the 
Wolverines, 

the 
Fighting 

Irish 
converted 

only one of their 
five 
attempts, 

in part due to 
the 
efforts 
of 

redshirt freshman 
goaltender 
Alli 

Kothari.

Making 
her 

second 
career 

start, Kothari recorded a career-
high nine saves. Despite six of the 
nine saves coming in the second 
half, Michigan failed to take 
advantage of her performance in 
the cage.

“For us, this was a great game 

and great learning experience 
from the sense that we’re really 

learning how to play 60 minutes,” 
said Michigan coach Jennifer 
Ulehla. “We played a great 25.”

“I would say our defense 

played an incredible game, our 
goaltender 
especially 
at 
the 

end came up very big. We had 
opportunities to get back in 
the game, and we just lost our 
composure.”

Despite the 0-4 start to 

the season, the team believes 
that as the season progresses, 
improvements will show.

“Again, I think we really did 

grow as a team today and our 
attack did really well from how it 
has been showing the last couple 
weeks,” Breitfeller said. “It’s 
good, we’re showing growth. 
And like I said, playing these 
teams now, further in the season, 
you’re going to see us when we 
go on those runs. And when we 
stop those runs and finish, then 
instead of it being 3-2, it’ll be 
6-2.”

For the first time in program 

history, the Michigan women’s 
lacrosse team (0-3) faced off 
against Notre Dame (4-1) in 
Ann Arbor. And though the 
Wolverines have aspirations 
of being a top team like the 
eighth-ranked Fighting Irish, 
the lopsided outcome — a 12-5 
Notre Dame win — revealed 
Michigan’s most glaring flaw: 
inconsistency.

At the 10-minute mark of 

the first half, the Wolverines 
held a 3-2 lead after scoring 
three straight goals.

“We 
just 
came 
out 

confidently,” said Michigan 
coach Jennifer Ulehla. “We 
were taking care of the draw, 
which is the most important 
thing, and recognizing what 
kind of defense they were 
playing, and we knew exactly 

how to beat it.”

The Wolverines had brief 

stints where both the offense 
and defense were clicking, but 
they could not string together 
60 minutes of consistent play. 
After scoring three straight 
goals against Notre Dame, 
Michigan 
was 
once 
again 

unable to maintain a high 
level of play on both ends of 
the field. A big stop on defense 
would lead to a turnover 
in transition, and a goal on 
offense would be countered by 
a goal from the Fighting Irish.

“We clearly have to work on 

our transition game,” Ulehla 
said, “Coming up with great 
saves and defensive turnovers 
then being able to get the 
ball up the field, especially 
when we start to get fatigued 
— which isn’t an excuse — 
so we gotta work on getting 
the ball up safely and staying 
composed offensively for 60 
minutes.”

Its inconsistent play has 

haunted 
Michigan 
multiple 

times this season. In their 
season opener against Oregon, 
the Wolverines scored three 
straight goals to pull within 
one, 
but 
were 
unable 
to 

continue this level of play and 
eventually fell to the Ducks, 
11-8. 
Despite 
Michigan’s 

troubles early this season, 
finding consistency is exactly 
what a young program like the 
Wolverines needs in order to 
create a winning culture.

“When 
we 
have 
those 

opportunities, we’ll actually 
finish 
in 
the 
future,” 

said 
senior 
attacker 
Allie 

Breitfeller. “I definitely think 
there is a lot of hope for 
our team, and once we start 
clicking all over the field and 
executing consistently, that’s 
when our team is gonna win.”

Once defensive stops are 

converted to goals on the 
offensive end and the brief 
high level of play Michigan has 
flashed early on in the season 
becomes 
a 
normalcy, 
the 

results may turn in its favor.

“We had 

opportunities 
to get back in 

the game”

Wolverines to host Nebraska on Senior Night 

Four 
years 
ago, 
guards 

Siera Thompson and Danielle 
Williams were new to the No. 25 
Michigan women’s basketball 
team. 

Now, in their final regular 

season game, the two seniors 
will be honored 
before 
the 

contest in the 
midst 
of 
the 

Wolverines’ 
best 
season 

since 
they 

arrived 
in 

Ann 
Arbor. 

Michigan (10-4 
Big Ten, 21-7 
overall) 
will 

face off against 
Nebraska 
(2-12, 
6-20) 

on 
Thursday 

night at Crisler 
Center, where 
the Wolverines 
have lost only 
once all season to Michigan 
State on Feb. 19. 

“Our league is incredibly 

difficult,” said Michigan coach 
Kim Barnes Arico on WTKA. 
“And our last two games back 
to back, we played Indiana and 
Michigan State — who were 
preseason picked to finish third 
in our league. We knew they 
were a great team. Michigan 
State had beaten Ohio State 
earlier in the season by 20, Ohio 
State went and beat Maryland 
last night, who only had one 
loss to (Connecticut) on the 
year.

“So I think we played against 

some quality opponents and 
it was a great test for us, 
preparing us to finish out our 
last few games in the regular 
season and head on into the Big 
Ten Tournament.”

This senior class is special 

to Barnes Arico as it is her first 
recruiting class to graduate 
from Michigan.

Thompson 
has 
appeared 

in 136 games in her career, 
starting 128. She is currently 
second in program history for 
minutes played in her career, 
totaling 4,453 — just 105 behind 
first place. 

Thompson is also currently 

second in career 3-pointers 
(232), second in assists (515) 
and 10th in all-time scoring 
(1,386). 

Williams, meanwhile, has 

played in 112 games, starting 
just 43 and averaging 1.5 points 
per game in 12.7 minutes. While 
the statistics may not show it, 
she is considered a backbone 
of the program, serving as 
co-captain with Thompson for 
the past two seasons. 

As a team, the Wolverines 

reached 10 wins in the Big Ten 
for the first time under Barnes 
Arico. The school record for 
most conference wins is 13, 
impossible for Michigan to 
surpass as it has just two 
more games left in the regular 
season.

However, 
Michigan 
could 

still take third place in the Big 
Ten Tournament with only one 
more win, and has a chance to 
finish third or better within the 
conference for just the fourth 
time ever. 

“It’s definitely an advantage 

and we haven’t been in that 
position, I don’t believe, since 
I’ve been here,” Barnes Arico 
said on WTKA. “I think the 
biggest advantage of it, is that 
your kids get an extra day of 
rest, which at this point in the 
year — we had our bye week 
really early in the season — 
so there is a bunch of teams 
coming off of bye weeks late. … 
I think us getting that double 
bye would really give our team 
an extra day of rest, as well as 

the coaches and the team an 
extra day to prepare. And we 
are at our best when we have 
that time to prepare for our 
opponent and really lock in and 
really focus.”

The Wolverines stayed in the 

Associated Press poll this week, 
marking their third-straight 
week and the fifth appearance 
under Barnes Arico. The USA 
Today Coaches Poll ranked 
Michigan 24th. 

Junior 
guard 
Katelynn 

Flaherty has helped her team 
get to this point, averaging 19.7 
points per game on 44.3 percent 
shooting to date. She currently 
boasts 1,826 total points to rank 
second in all-time scoring at 

Michigan, and is just roughly 
over 200 away from knocking 
Diane Dietz out of first place. 

The 

Cornhuskers 
only have one 
player 
hitting 

double-digits 
on average in 
forward Jessica 
Shepard 
with 

18.4 
points. 

Altogether, 
Nebraska 
averages 
62.1 

points a game 
and allows 75.9 points per 
game. Still, Barnes Arico has 
stressed that Michigan can’t 
take the matchup lightly.

“That’s the thing with the 

bottom of our league,” Barnes 
Arico said on WTKA. “Those 

teams 
are 

continuing 
to 

play 
extremely 

hard, and those 
teams have some 
great players on 
them. 
Nebraska 

is led by Jess 
Shepard, who is 
an 
All-America 

candidate. 
And 
they’re 

still playing. … 

Wisconsin and Nebraska had 
wins this week. You want to talk 
about kind of a letdown — as 
well as Indiana played against 

us 
… 
they 
looked 
nothing 

like the team we played, and 
Nebraska went and beat them.

“Nebraska is coming off a 

great 
win 
against 
Indiana, 

and they will be fired up when 
they come into our place. And I 
think our kids know, by playing 
Wisconsin late, that teams in 
the league are still fighting 
even if they’re down at the 
bottom of the league, and we 
need to be prepared. … We did 
a great job against them the 
first time at their place, but 
that doesn’t mean that they’re 
not a much-improved team and 
they will come in fired up for 
an opportunity to play a ranked 
opponent.”

Wolverines survive on the road against Rutgers

After a tough loss in overtime 

to Minnesota on Sunday, the 
Michigan men’s basketball team 
had the opportunity to bounce 
back at Rutgers — by any metric 
the worst team in the Big Ten.

Not only was it a chance for 

the Wolverines to recover from 
a crushing loss, it was a virtually 
a must-win game against a team 
outside the Rating Percentage 
Index top-100. With Michigan on 
the NCAA Tournament bubble, a 
loss would’ve been a big blow.

The 
Wolverines, 
despite 

the 
high-pressure 
situation, 

prevailed, winning 68-64 in 
Piscataway.

It 
wasn’t 
a 
dominating 

performance for Michigan (8-7 
Big Ten, 18-10 overall) — not 
even close. While the Wolverines 
jumped out to multiple double-
digit leads, the Scarlet Knights 

continued to claw back, even 
taking a four-point lead with 
6:46 left in the game.

But a 10-0 Michigan run late 

in the game proved to be too 
much for Rutgers (2-14, 13-16), 
and the Wolverines escaped with 
a victory. 

“There was nothing pretty 

about this game,” said Michigan 
coach John Beilein on Michigan 
IMG Sports Radio Network. 
“This was all gritty. We just got 
enough done.”

Added redshirt sophomore 

forward DJ Wilson on Michigan 
IMG Sports Radio Network: 
“(The key) was we stayed locked 
in for all 40 minutes. We knew 
they were a gritty team, and they 
fight to the end, and they did 
today. We fought to the end too, 
and when it came down to the 
end to get crucial stops, we did.”

The 
Wolverines 
had 
to 

overcome some early ailments, 
though, as they struggled early 

with turnovers. They would 
commit 11 in the game, mostly 
the result of sloppy passes, 
coming in nearly two above their 
season average of 9.4 per game.

Michigan also shot just 40.7 

percent 
from 

the field, a far 
cry from their 
season average 
of 47.5 percent.

But — perhaps 

unexpectedly 
— what kept 
the Wolverines 
in the game was 
their 
offensive 

rebounding. 
Michigan 
finished 
the 
game 
with 
12 

offensive 
rebounds, 
scoring 

seven second-chance points.

It was an especially impressive 

performance 
given 
Rutgers’ 

pedigree on the glass. The 
Scarlet Knights, coming into the 
game, were No. 4 in the NCAA 

in rebounds per game with 
41.1. Rutgers was held to just 33 
boards in the game.

“In the first half they had 

one offensive rebound,” Beilein 
said. “I think in the second half 

they probably had 
more during that 
time, they got all 
those at the end 
there. 
We 
just 

had to scrap and 
continue to scrap 
and just see what 
we could do to find 
a way to win that 
game.”

Wilson 
led 

the way for the 

Wolverines with 11 rebounds, 
including six offensive boards. 
He also finished with 10 points 
for the fourth double-double of 
his career.

“Coach 
emphasized 

rebounding because I haven’t 
been on the boards these last few 

games,” Wilson said. “I think I 
only had two offensive rebounds 
in the last five games. So I tried 
to get there as much as possible 
today.”

While senior guard Derrick 

Walton Jr. finished with 13 
points, he shot just 3-of-10 from 
the field, with nine of his shots 
coming from beyond the arc.

“Everybody did it,” Beilein 

said. 
“Don’t 
forget 
(junior 

guard Muhammad-Ali Abdur-
Rahkman), he did a tremendous 
job as well. (Sophomore forward 
Moritz Wagner) made a big play 
down the stretch. We still had 
some lapses. I think we’re really 
tired right now, I mean really 
tired. We had to gut that one out, 
and we did.”

On the other side of the court, 

Rutgers put up a valiant effort 
led by guard Corey Sanders, 
who had 15 points in the game. 
The Scarlet Knights also got 
contributions from guard Mike 

Williams, who put up 14 points 
and grabbed 8 rebounds.

“(Rutgers) showed a lot of 

fortitude by being able to stay in 
there when nothing could go our 
way down the stretch,” Beilein 
said.

While the victory didn’t come 

in the most impressive fashion, 
Michigan stays on the right side 
of the bubble, something that 
wouldn’t have been certain had 
the Wolverines lost.

It was crucial for Michigan 

to get a win at Rutgers, and now 
with that done, the Wolverines 
will need to elevate their game 
as their matchup with No. 15 
Purdue looms on Senior Day.

“This is definitely a learning 

experience for us,” Wilson said. 
“We’ve been in a lot of close 
games that we’ve kind of just 
gave up at the end, but today, 
we fought hard and we stayed 
consistent on defense, and it paid 
off.”

With time running out, Kile has a shot to salvage senior season

Expectations were high for 

Alex Kile entering this season, 
and deservedly so. The senior 
forward was the Michigan hockey 
team’s returning leading scorer 
and had increased his offensive 
production between every season 
of his career. 

Kile first earned consistent 

playing 
time 
his 
freshman 

year before breaking out as a 
sophomore whilst on the same 
line as two future NHL forwards 
in Dylan Larkin and Zach Hyman. 
He began his junior year playing 
with Tyler Motte and JT Compher 
— another pair of future pros — 
before settling onto a line with a 
pair of experienced seniors in Boo 
Nieves and Justin Selman.

By all accounts, this was 

supposed to be his year. As 
a captain and one of the few 
holdovers from last year’s NCAA 
Tournament team, Kile was as 
close to a sure thing as possible.

“I 
think 
the 
expectations 

for him were higher than (for) 
the team,” said Michigan coach 
Red 
Berenson. 
“The 
team’s 

expectations had a lot more 
question marks. There weren’t 
many question marks around Alex 
Kile. He was experienced, he was 
a senior, he was a captain, he was 
our returning leading scorer. So 
there was no doubt that he was 
going to have a great year.”

But with just six games left in 

the regular season, that hasn’t 
been the case — or even close to 
it. In 21 games played, Kile has 
tallied just six goals and four 
assists. He struggled through a 
six-game pointless streak earlier 
this year. He was ejected from the 
Wolverines’ 7-4 loss to Wisconsin 
on Dec. 9. And then, just as he 
was starting to heat up following 
the series against the Badgers — 
which he deemed a ‘wake-up call’ 
— Kile suffered an ankle injury in 
practice. 

It took him nearly three and 

a half weeks before he could 
practice again. He returned to the 

ice Tuesday and Wednesday, but 
but still hadn’t been cleared for full 
contact. Kile won’t be traveling to 
Columbus this weekend either, 
marking the seventh and eighth 
consecutive games that he will 
miss. Even then, there is still no 
guarantee that he will return 
before the Big Ten Tournament, 
despite his best hopes.

“I’m not the best right now,” Kile 

said. “I’m just trying to get through 
(the injury). I’m not going to play 
this weekend, and hopefully (I’ll) 
get ready for my last four games at 
Yost. That’s the plan.

“I don’t think I’ll be full 

strength by the end of the year. 
It’s unfortunate, but I’m a senior, 
so I’ve just got to play through 
the pain. It’s my last three weeks 
at Michigan. I’ve just got to take it 
all in.”

He has dealt with the injury in 

different ways. Rehab has been 
the one constant — a daily regimen 

of physical therapy, stimulation, 
icing, and a couple of things even 
Kile doesn’t know how to describe. 
Before he was cleared to practice, 
he would sit in the bleachers 
at times, a lonely figure in an 
otherwise empty 
Yost Ice Arena 
silently watching 
his 
team 
on 

the ice below. 
And when the 
team 
traveled 

without him, he 
would 
kill 
all 

the downtime he 
never expected 
to have, waiting 
patiently for the 
games to come on TV.

“You know, the last couple 

weekends at Yost have been 
emotional for me, realizing that 
my time is coming to an end,” Kile 
said. “We’ve got two weekends 
here left. Just got to make the most 

of it. Being out and watching the 
team play while you’re a senior is 
tough. ... It’s probably the toughest 
thing I’ve gone through as a player, 
knowing it’s coming to an end. So 
I’ve just got to get through it.”

Added 

Berenson: “I think 
it really hit (Kile) 
hard. He expected 
he was just going 
to be a dominant 
player, and I was 
hoping he would be 
a dominant player, 
everyone thought 
he would be a 
dominant 
player, 

and it didn’t work 

out that way. Maybe it was without 
Cooper, and too much onus was on 
Alex and then he gets injured, and 
now he’s looking at the end of his 
career facing him in the upcoming 
month.”

Kile, it appears, is in an 

unexpected position as the clock 
on his career winds down. He may 
have envisioned himself as the 
lynchpin of a team still fighting 
for the Big Ten at this point of the 
year, and Berenson likely did too. 
Instead, Kile has been confined to 
the sidelines, while Michigan sits 
just two points ahead of last-place 
Michigan State.

“It sucks that our team isn’t 

doing as well as we’d like,” Kile 
said. “My linemates last year were 
two seniors. One of them played 
in the NHL this year, one of them 
in the AHL, so it’s just different 
transitioning 
from 
that 
high 

offensive group to this year. It’s 
tough, and it’s not what I expected 
of my individual success. But 
we’re a team, and it’s not about me. 
It’s about the team, and we’ve got 
to try to turn things around right 
now.”

With any chance of punching a 

ticket to the NCAA Tournament 

in 
the 
regular 
season 
long 

expired, Kile and the Wolverines 
are now focusing on the Big Ten 
Tournament, where just three 
wins stand between them and a 
guaranteed postseason bid.

Just how much of a long shot 

that may be depends on whether 
Kile can make an impact, injured 
ankle and all.

“He’s got a chance to jumpstart 

our 
offense,” 
Berenson 
said. 

“He’s been out for awhile, and he 
can’t wait. It’s his senior year. It 
should be no question about his 
inspiration to this team.

“You look and see who’s our 

leading 
scorer 
against 
Ohio 

State, and it’s Alex Kile. And to 
no surprise, that would probably 
be true with most teams, but 
particularly Ohio State. So yeah, 
it’s a big loss but we can’t dwell 
on the loss. We’ve got to dwell on 
what we have, and who’s playing 
and how hard they’re playing … 
but we know we aren’t as good 
offensively without Alex Kile, so 
we’ve got to be better defensively. 
Somebody’s got to pick up the 
slack.”

One thing is clear, though: Kile 

has come to terms with how things 
have gone this year. What matters 
now is the opportunity to leave 
the trainer’s table, reclaim a lost 
senior season and attempt to push 
his team back into the postseason 
— no matter how unlikely that 
may be.

“My individual success is a 

big part of this team,” Kile said. 
“If I can get rolling and get some 
confidence going into the Big 
Ten Tournament, it’s only going 
to help. All it takes is one good 
weekend, and that’s what we need 
to do. I don’t like to say it, but 
we’re not going to win the Big Ten. 
We’re probably going to be a fifth 
seed, so (we) gotta focus on the 
Big Ten Tournament, upset some 
teams and be the underdog.”

Added Berenson: “No question. 

If Alex gets hot — just like our 
team if our team gets hot — then 
you forget about how you started. 
You just remember how you 
ended.”

Senior forward Alex Kile’s final season has taken an unexpected trajectory, but he is still relishing the opportunity to spark life into the Wolverines.
