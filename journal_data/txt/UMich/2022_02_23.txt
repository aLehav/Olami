ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

First Regents meeting of year discusses 

presidential search, felony disclosure policy

Public commenters advocate for student representation on the Board, more focus on carbon neutrality efforts

The University of Michigan Board 

of Regents met at the Postma Family 
Clubhouse Thursday for their first 
meeting of the year. They discussed 
plans for a presidential search 
committee, new dorm proposals on 
North Campus and heard from the 
Central Student Government about 
the current felony disclosure policy. 

Coleman began the meeting by 

emphasizing her commitment to the 
University community as well as her 
focus on academic excellence.

“Our collective commitment to 

learning and discovery holds true 
for yesterday, and it will guide us for 
tomorrow,” Coleman said. “It is what 
compels us as a university to take 
great risks, so that we may always 
pursue new knowledge for the good 
of society.” 

Coleman’s current contract with 

the University has her serving for 
six months or until a new president 
is appointed.

Regents Denise Ilitch (D) and 

Sarah Hubbard (R) gave statements 
on 
the 
Presidential 
Search 

Committee, which is comprised 
of students, faculty and staff from 
all three campuses and Michigan 
Medicine. The duo announced the 
committee in an email to the campus 
community

“Our board is very excited about 

our presidential search and we 
have worked very hard to build a 
Presidential 
Search 
Committee 

that is widely representative of our 
very diverse community,” Ilitch 
said. “We’ve already had our initial 
meeting, and we look forward to 
insights from this incredible group as 
we proceed with our search. We are 
eager to hear directly from students, 
faculty and staff across campuses 
about 
their 
perspectives 
and 

expectations as we work to identify 
the next leader of our university.”

Hubbard said the University is 

hosting a virtual listening session on 
Feb. 18 for Ann Arbor campus faculty 
and staff. Other sessions gauged 
towards Michigan Medicine, Ann 
Arbor students and the Dearborn 
campus community are scheduled 
for Feb. 21-23.

The regents also discussed plans 

for 
constructing 
a 
geothermal 

plant to power the new Leinweber 
Computer Science and Information 
Building. This project would be the 
first large campus building to rely on 
a source other than natural gas for 
climate control.

Rebecca 
Cunningham, 
vice 

president of research, then briefed 
the regents on the state of research 
at the University. Cunningham said 
the University has remained the 
leader among public universities for 
the eleventh year in a row in terms 
of research volume, especially in 
the social sciences. She also said 
University research projects resulted 
in 23 startups, 502 inventions and 

287 license and option agreements 
in the past years. 

Nithya Arun, Central Student 

Government President, gave the 
Student Government Report to 
discuss 
the 
University’s 
felony 

disclosure policy as well as student 
representation 
on 
the 
Board 

of Regents. The current felony 
disclosure 
policy 
(SPG 
601.38) 

requires employees of the University 
disclose all felony charges and 
convictions 
that 
occur 
while 

affiliated with the University; CSG 
passed a resolution on Tuesday 
asking the Regents to rescind this policy. 

“It is known that Black and 

Indigenous 
communities 
are 

disproportionately 
criminalized 

and surveilled,” Arun said. “Because 
of structural factors in the justice 
system, 
BIPOC 
communities 
are 

disproportionately affected by SPG 
601.38.”

President Joe Biden visited 

Lorain, Ohio — a small industrial 
steel town 140 miles southeast 
of Ann Arbor — on Thursday 
to 
discuss 
the 
$1 
trillion 

infrastructure bill he signed into 
law last November and announce 
$1 billion in funding for the 
protection of the Great Lakes.

Joined 
by 
a 
cohort 
of 

lawmakers and cabinet members, 
Biden spoke to a crowd of about 
60 guests in The Shipyards, a 
warehouse-turned-restaurant 
standing along the shores of the 

Black River and Lake Erie.

The president’s trip to the 

Cleveland suburb is one of 
several recent speeches from 
Democratic 
politicians 
in 

support of the infrastructure 
package. Both U.S. Rep. Debbie 
Dingell, D-MI, and Biden’s visits 
served to discuss infrastructure 
and Great Lakes conservation 
efforts.

The crowd cheered after 

Biden announced the $1 billion 
in funding for the Great Lakes 
Restoration Initiative, a program 
dedicated 
to 
protecting 
the 

wildlife and ecosystems of the 
Great Lakes basin.

“It’s going to allow the most 

significant restoration of the 
Great Lakes in the history of the 
Great Lakes,” Biden said. “We’re 
going to accelerate cleanup of 
sites across six states in the Great 
Lakes Basin… And we know these 
sites were dangerously polluted 
for decades. We’re committed to 
(cleaning) them up.”

Biden 
emphasized 
the 

need to invest in American 
infrastructure, 
citing 
the 

collapse of a Pittsburgh bridge 
last month and widespread 
lead contamination of water 
in the United States.

Content warning: This article 

contains descriptions of sexual 
assault.

The University of Michigan 

Board of Regents met Thursday, 
their first time meeting after 
firing 
former 
University 

President Mark Schlissel for 
engaging in an inappropriate 
relationship with a subordinate. 
Schlissel’s firing came after 
the former president touted 
revisions to the supervisor 
relationship policy in response 
to sexual misconduct at the 
University.

University alum Isabelle 

Brourman, 
a 
survivor 
of 

sexual assault, criticized the 
University’s 
re-appointment 

of Interim President Mary 
Sue Coleman. 

“Firing Schlissel is not 

enough,” 
Brourman 
said 

during public comments. “You 
fired one president for sexual 
misconduct and then hired 
another who was historically 
indifferent to it. Despite her 
comments today, Mary Sue 
Coleman has demonstrated 
that 
she 
is 
part 
of 
the 

problem.” 

Brourman 
said 
Coleman 

and the University were aware 
of 
former 
Provost 
Martin 

Philbert’s 
previous 
sexual 

misconduct allegations when 
he was made dean of the 
School of Public Health. 

In an interview with The 

Michigan 
Daily, 
Brourman 

said 
she 
filed 
a 
lawsuit 

against the University after 
her FOIA request — seeking 
information about investigations 
into 
accusations 
of 
sexual 

misconduct against Conforth 
done in 2008 and 2016 — was 
never acknowledged. 

“(Brourman 
and 
other 

survivors) were curious about 
what (the University) knew 
about each (case of abuse) 
through 
the 
investigation 

because we never heard from 
them, and we still haven’t heard 
from the University,” Brourman 
said. “That’s the part that shocks 
me the most is that they could 
know that there was somebody 
out there that he abused when 
they looked into his University 
email and his computer who 
they decided not to reach out to.” 

In addition to the lawsuit, 

Brourman said she is actively 
working to get representation 
from survivors of sexual assault 
on 
the 
Presidential 
Search 

Committee. 

“We are hopeful that the 

University will take seriously 
what I asked for, which is 
to assign U-M survivors — 
unfortunately, there’s a ton that 
they could choose from — to help 
steer the Presidential Selection 
Committee,” Brourman said. 

Brourman 
added 
that 
if 

the University extended the 
invitation to join the committee, 
she would accept. 

“A huge part of why we’re 

doing what we’re doing is 
because we don’t trust the 
administration 
to 
protect 

(students),” Brourman said. “And 
God forbid, unfortunately, it’s 
becoming increasingly clear that 
if, God forbid, something were to 
happen to a student and they got 
raped, instead of being protected 
they’ll be perceived as a threat, 
to the school and its reputation, 
and that has to change.”

Over 200 Washtenaw 

County 
community 

members 
met 
over 

Zoom 
Wednesday 

night 
to 
discuss 
the 

implementation 
of 

an 
unarmed 
safety 

response team for the 
county. Led by members 
of 
the 
Coalition 
for 

Re-Envisioning 
Our 

Safety 
(CROS) 

— as well as 

several other sponsored 
organizations 
— 
the 

forum 
discussed 
the 

need 
for 
non-police 

responses to community 
crises as well as a path to 
implementation 
within 

the county. 

Donnell 
Wyche, 

pastor of the Vineyard 
Church of Ann Arbor, 
spoke first about CROS 
and 
its 
dedication 
to 

community-led work. In 
late January 2022, CROS 
released 
a 
statement 

on their idea of what 
an 
unarmed 
response 

team in Ann Arbor could 
look like. Wyche said 
the 
organization 
will 

prioritize transformative 

justice 
and 
building 

care-based safety within 
the 
community 
when 

considering methods of 
implementation. 

“CROS 
is 
a 
group 

of folks who’ve come 
together to ensure that 
this process and program 
that 
is 
being 
created 

is 
community-led, 
it’s 

evidence based and that 
it is progressive,” Wyche 
said.

Wyche continued to 

explain how the proposed 
unarmed safety response 
team 
will 
encourage 

people to move away from 
the typical model of a 911 
call to police. 

“When you think of 

the majority of the calls 
that come into a dispatch 
center, over 83% of those 
calls 
do 
not 
require 

someone 
who’s 
been 

authorized with a weapon 
to 
respond,” 
Wyche 

said. “Only 17% of the 
calls might fit someone’s 
definition of crime. It 
might be petty larceny or 
maybe property crime, 
but only 4% of those are 
what 
someone 
might

The 
University 
of 

Michigan’s Office of Campus 
Sustainability 
(OCS) 

announced the expansion 
of on-campus composting 
programs in support of their 
waste reduction initiative. 
OCS introduced composting 
through their Zero Waste 
Initiative in 2017, focusing on 
education, accessibility and 
implementation throughout 
the campus community. 

Composting is the process 

of recycling organic matter 
by allowing it to decompose 
into fertilizer for the soil. Any 
food waste and materials 
that 
are 
Biodegradable 

Products Institute certified 
compostable are considered 
safe to compost, and BPI 
certification is designed to 
prevent greenwashing. 

Benefits of composting 

include: reducing emissions 
from landfills, improving 
soil health and reducing 
food waste. The University 
aims to reduce food waste 
40% by 2025;currently, food 
waste has been reduced by 
32% since Fall 2021. All of 
the University’s compostable 
waste gets sent to the City 
of Ann Arbor’s compost site 

operated by WeCare.

There are currently over 

1,000 compost bins in over 
150 buildings on campus, but 
most of the bins are located 
in 
staff-focused 
areas, 

according to Anya Dale, 
manager of Waste Reduction 
and Engagement at OCS. 

“(Compost bins in staff-

focused 
areas) 
enables 

us to capture a lot of the 
compostable wastes with 
very 
minimal 
concern 

of 
contamination,” 
Dale 

said. “It’s really important 
that 
we 
minimize 
that 

contamination because the 
facility we take our compost 
to does not have a sorting 
mechanism for getting rid of 
contamination.”

Contaminants are materials 

that are not compostable and 
can damage the plants and soil 
during the compost process. 

Plastic is one of the most 

prevalent 
contaminants; 

once mixed with the rest of 
the compost, animals might 
mistake 
plastic 
particles 

for food. Additionally, with 
heavy rainfall irrigation, the 
microplastic pieces could 
flow into water sources and 
contaminate the water.

2 — Wednesday, February 23, 2022

From the age of five, LSA senior 

Ninnie Chiang knew she had a love 
for dance — a realization that came 
from her first kindergarten class 
performance, where she soared across 
the stage. 

After 
taking 
a 
break 
from 

dance, Chiang said she decided to 
re-immerse herself in the art upon 
arriving at the University of Michigan 

to take back part of her identity. 

Chiang said she planned to include 
dance into her collegiate education but 
there was one problem: a dance minor 
was not offered through the College of 
Literature, Science and the Arts.

Despite being recognized as a 

minor in other schools, including the 
School of Music, Theatre & Dance, 
LSA has yet to establish a dance minor. 
Even if LSA students complete all of 
the required classes for a dance minor, 
they will not receive a minor upon 
graduation.

In November 2021, Chiang and 

her peers, LSA seniors Kyla Hyatt and 
Yuyao Sun, decided to take action. 
They sent multiple emails to dance 

advisors, department chairs and the 
head of the LSA curriculum asking for 
answers.

Chiang said she is disappointed 

by the lack of action from the LSA 
department. She said that although 
she was previously notified about the 
absence of the minor in LSA by her 
advisor, she still chose to move ahead 
with the hope she would be able to 
eventually complete the dance minor 
as an LSA student.

“What seemed at first like an issue 

from the past 3-5 years now seems like 
a decade-long issue,” Chiang said. “It’s 
been passed for years from individual 
to individual.” 

In November 2021, Chiang, Hyatt 

and Sun created a petition to increase 
awareness and urge LSA to consider 
recognizing the dance minor. As of 
Feb. 15, the petition has received over 
800 signatures.

“I feel like there is a path for the 

minor to get approved, but for some 
reason it’s so convoluted and difficult,” 
Hyatt said. “I think it’s because the 
minor was denied before, but not for 
super clear reasons.”

Associate 
Dean 
Tim 
McKay 

reached out to the Daily about a possible 
explanation for this discrepancy. 

“The dance minor was proposed 

to the LSA curriculum committee 
about five years ago. At that time, 
several concerns were raised by the 
committee, including about the fact 
that the minor requires 22 credits 
(most minors require 15-18),” McKay 
wrote. “Those concerns are now 
being addressed by SMTD, and we are 
hopeful that a credential for the dance 
minor will be available to LSA students 
in the near future.”

LSA sophomore Isabel Reid – who 

also signed the petition – said she 
considered switching to the School 
of Kinesiology to complete the dance 
minor, but faced many challenges along 
the way. 

“I’m pre-med and the education 

that I really want in my undergrad 
aligns more with what LSA offers,” 
Reid said. “I knew it would be too big of 
a sacrifice to have to start over with pre-
reqs as well, and I wasn’t willing to give 
that up just for the minor, even though 
it does mean a lot to me.”

Reid 
also 
has 
an 
academic 

scholarship 
through 
LSA 
that 

would not transfer over to any other 
school, further preventing her from 
switching and being able to complete 
her intended dance minor.

The dance minor at the University 

consists of 22 credits over four areas: 
technique, composition, dance history 
and electives. According to the SMTD 
course website, applicants for the 
dance minor who have not completed 
a U-M Dance Department technique 
course at the 101 level or above should 
send a video “that demonstrates dance 
proficiency and a one-page dance 
resume.” While awaiting acceptance, 
students are able to enroll in Dance 
101, 102, 103, or 104 as an entry-level 
course in the program. 

Hyatt said she currently has a job 

teaching classes at an off-campus 
dance studio and plans to take a year 
off after graduation to teach full time. 
When it comes to finding future jobs 
in the dance industry, Hyatt said she 
worries that the lack of a recognized 
minor will limit her opportunities. 

“If I were to want to get another 

job similar to mine elsewhere, I don’t 
necessarily have the credentials,” 
Hyatt said. “So I guess I’d just have to 
tell a potential employer that I’ve met 
the requirements for a dance minor 
and hope they’ll take my word for it.”

Find answers to your biggest questions 

on climate change action at UMich 

 Curious about U-M’s 

carbon neutrality 
plan? Here are the 

latest updates.

ADMINISTRATION

ARJUN THAKKAR
Daily Staff Reporter

Various University of Michigan 

stakeholders for the past few 
years, including student as well 
as staff and faculty organizations, 
have pushed for the University to 
take an active role in combating 
climate change by reducing its 
greenhouse gas emissions.

The University has responded 

to these requests by presenting 
a path for the institution to 
become 
carbon 
neutral 
and 

limit emissions so they are 

equivalent to the amount of 

emissions sequestered from the 
atmosphere. The University has 
committed to eliminating its 
scope 1 emissions across all three 
campuses by 2040, achieving net-
zero scope 2 emissions by 2025, 
and establishing goals by 2025 for 
eliminating scope 3 emissions.

Scope 
1 
emissions 
are 

greenhouse 
gasses 
directly 

released 
by 
the 
University, 

including emissions from the 
campus power plant, heating and 
cooling for buildings and bus 
transportation. Scope 2 emissions 
are generated by the electricity 
purchased from other utilities to 
help power the campus. Scope 3 
emissions are indirect sources of 
emissions at the University and 
include commuting to campus 
(using cars and The Ride buses), 

food and University-affiliated 
travel.

This commitment to carbon 

neutrality followed months of 
research and deliberation from 
the President’s Commission on 
Carbon Neutrality, created in 
February 2019 and consists of 
various faculty members, students 
and advisors to deliver a report 
with a plan for the University to 
obtain net-zero carbon emissions. 
The 
final 
report,released 
in 

March 2021, outlined specific 
recommendations on how the 
University could achieve net-zero 
emissions.

Community members argue 

the 
University’s 
progress 
on 

achieving 
carbon 
neutrality 

has been too slow to address 
the ongoing climate crisis, with 
student 
organizations, 
such 

as Climate Action movement 
pressuring the University for a 
more aggressive timeline and to 
reduce emissions by 2030.

The Intergovernmental Panel 

on Climate Change, the scientific 
body under the United Nations 
that evaluates climate science, 
states humans need to reduce 
emissions to 45% below 2010 
levels by 2030 and achieve net 
zero emissions by 2050 in order 
to avert the damaging effects of 
climate change, including natural 
disasters.

Michigan Medicine, Detroit Zoo partner 

on non-invasive procedure

 Pediatric surgeons 
at C.S. Mott perform 
remedial surgery on 

premature chimp

JINGQI ZHU

Daily Staff Reporter

When Dr. Marcus Jarboe, director 

of Pediatric Minimally Invasive 
Surgery at the C.S. Mott Children’s 
Hospital, was approached by the 
Detroit Zoo to perform a therapeutic 
surgery on a newborn chimpanzee, 
he jumped at the opportunity to heal 
a non-traditional patient.

The premature chimp, named 

Zane, had developed an inguinal 
hernia — a painful bulge of tissue that 
develops in the groin region — five 
weeks after he was born, in January 
2020. For unclear reasons, Zane’s 
mother didn’t show any interest in 
her newborn, so the caretaker team 
began taking extra care of Zane in his 
early weeks. After Dr. Ann Duncan, 
director of Animal Health at the 
Detroit Zoo, and the team discovered 
Zane’s inguinal hernia, they reached 
out to Mott for help.

“Chimpanzee 
anatomy 
and 

human anatomy are very similar and 
the equipment needed for neonatal 
patients is specialized,” Duncan 
wrote in an email to The Michigan 
Daily. “For these reasons, we 
contacted a human pediatric surgeon 
with 
expertise 
in 
non-invasive 

laparoscopic repair techniques.” 

Contrary to the open hernia repair, 

the laparoscopic method allows the 
surgeon to visualize the hernia defect 
without making a large incision over 
the operating site. A camera called 

a laparoscope is inserted through 
the incision, and the surgeon uses 
the image relayed on a monitor to 
guide doctors as they perform the 
procedure. 

For his first non-human surgery, 

Jarboe said he decided to use the 
laparoscopic method because of 
his expertise in minimally invasive 
surgery. He also said the scope helps 
to better visualize the anatomy.

“I do most of my (surgeries)

laparoscopic and I think the hernia 
is easier to do laparoscopic,” Jarboe 
said. “I could figure out the anatomy 
easier with the scope.”

Jarboe also said pediatric surgeons 

have much expertise in performing 
surgery on human patients that 
are of similar size to Zane, so many 
of the procedures can be similarly 
performed on primate animals.

“Zane was somewhere around 

three kilograms,” Jarboe said. “It’s 
the same size we usually operate 
on.

In addition to two pediatric 

anesthesiologists assisting with the 
surgery, Jarboe said he invited senior 
pediatric surgeon Dr. Ronald Hirschl 
and two pediatric anesthesiologists 
to perform the surgery with him. 
He said inviting the pediatric 
anesthesiologists was important 
because of their expertise in 
inserting the endotracheal tube 
so the patient can breathe during

WE HAVE ALWAYS been 
obsessed with the looming 
apocalypse — the final, cata-
clysmic catastrophe that will 
end the world as we know it. 
It’s a question that has preoc-
cupied humanity seemingly 
forever, from biblical Rev-
elations to zombie flicks. But 
increasingly, the apocalypse 
doesn’t feel so far away. We’ve 
all 
gotten 
accustomed 
to 
our current “unprecedented 
times,” but everything seems 
a 
little 
too… 
precedented. 

How do we deal with the end 
of the world when it feels like 
it’s happening right in front 
of us? How do we reckon with 
the cultural phenomenon of 
the apocalypse when we’re 
living through it? Sometimes 
it feels like we’re walking 
towards our certain doom on a 
road with billboards still try-
ing to convince us everything 
is fine. This B-Side walks that 
road and examines how art is 
dealing with the concept of 
the apocalypse, both real and 
imagined.

The Apocalypse B-Side

The apocalyptic setting of ‘The Last of Us’ provided strange comfort during the pandemic

Phoebe Bridgers knows the end, but how do we 
deal with the ending?

The unfolding 
apocalypse: climate 
change, death and art

FOR MANY OF us, the pan-
demic has been a very isolating 
time. Particularly in the early 
stages of 2020, being shut off 
from people and places we care 
about was incredibly difficult to 
process. While many returned 
to lighter, more comforting art 
to help them process and get 
through some tough times, I 
personally preferred to consume 
darker, heavier art. I didn’t want 
art that distracted me; I wanted 
something that could help me 
deal with what I was feeling. 
I turned to a lot of apocalyptic-
based art. The Steven Soderbergh 
pandemic thriller “Contagion” 
was 
something 
that 
weirdly 
helped me cope with my fears 
surrounding the virus. Phoebe 

Bridgers’s gloomy album Punish-
er fit my feeling that everything 
around me was crumbling. But 
the art that was most helpful to 
me processing my feelings during 
the early stages of the pandemic 
was the video game series, “The 
Last of Us.” 
“The Last of Us” and its sequel 
“The Last of Us: Part II” take 
place in a post-apocalyptic future 
in which a fungal-based virus 
called Cordyceps has ravaged 
the world’s population, turning 
some into mushroom-controlled, 
infected people that the few sur-
vivors avoid while they try to 
pick up the pieces. The pandemic 
aspect of the game was an obvi-
ous (albeit twisted) draw for me 
going in, but what really had a sig-
nificant emotional impact on me 
was the way it handled themes of 
isolation and grief.
Large chunks of the first game 

are spent with the player in con-
trol of just two characters, Joel 
and Ellie, trekking through deso-
late cities across the United States 
in an attempt to find people who 
can use Ellie’s immunity to make 
a cure. Occasionally they run 
into other humans, but for the 
most part, it’s only the two leads 
and the infected who roam the 
areas. The settings in the game 
are often dangerously quiet, add-
ing a sense of fear of what lies 
ahead, but also conjuring a sense 
of loneliness that you may never 
see another human again. Backed 
by Gustavo Santaolalla’s longing 
acoustic guitar score, the game 
drives home a helpless isolation 
from society that becomes pow-
erful both in the context of the 
game and the outside context I 
brought to it.
The game captures an ever-
growing frustration for the char-

acters and the player. Every clue 
that seems like it might lead to 
the people Joel and Ellie are look-
ing for — a resistance group called 
the Fireflies — inevitably comes 
to a dead end. In reality, this 
resonated deeply with me: All I 
was hearing at the time was just 
to wait a little bit longer — wait 
until some milestone was hit — 
and we would go back to normal. 
I had felt so isolated for so long, 
and I got my hopes up every time 
it seemed like we were approach-
ing normal again. But we never 
got there. The isolation and lone-
liness only got worse. Every day 
seemed more and more hopeless.
Ultimately, Joel and Ellie’s 
journey to find the Fireflies ends 
in bittersweet fashion. They do 
not end up finding a cure, thanks 
to a major decision by Joel, but 
they do find a small commu-
nity where they no longer feel 

so isolated. This mirrors how 
the world around us has gone in 
the past couple of years. We are 
back to socializing with people, 
and our communities have come 
back together, but it still doesn’t 
really feel normal. We’re still liv-
ing with the virus and many of 
the precautions put in place, and 
although we aren’t as isolated 
anymore, it’s still hard to say 
we’re past it. 
The second game in the series, 
while still having elements of iso-
lation like the first game, deals 
far more with the theme of grief. 
This progression nicely paral-
leled the way I processed the 
pandemic. After dealing with 
isolation for so long, there was a 
devastating amount of loss still 
to process. Much of that loss felt 
unnecessary, and had people in 
positions to do something acted 
quicker or differently, perhaps 

the outcome would have been 
better. Similarly, “The Last of Us: 
Part II” sees Ellie having to pro-
cess the unnecessary loss brought 
on by Joel’s decision to not use her 
to create a cure for the in-game 
virus. It never felt like it needed 
to be this way, but for many of us, 
like Ellie, it was never our deci-
sion to make — there was nothing 
we could do about it.
“The Last of Us” series will 
always be a very important work 
of art to me. Not only are the 
games’ 
narratives 
incredibly 
engaging and emotional, but the 
mid-pandemic context in which I 
first played them meant they res-
onated much deeper with me. It 
provided me with a nice outlet for 
my feelings of isolation and grief 
during the pandemic. Despite its 
brutal dark tone and its apocalyp-
tic setting, I was still able to find 
comfort in “The Last of Us.” 

APOCALYPSES ARE POW-
ERFUL entities. They rep-
resent 
full-scale 
calamitous 
events with the potential to 
wipe out everything we know 
to be familiar and true. For 
artists, they’re an opportunity 
to experiment with our imagi-
native endurance as human 
beings, an attempt to put to 
words the entropy that mani-
fests at the end of the world. In 
reality, apocalyptic occurrenc-
es seem unfathomable, entirely 
void of rhyme or reason and 
almost always end up hitting us 
when we least expect it.
Improbable as they may be, 
we’re endlessly trying (and 
failing) to answer the end-
all-be-all questions we know 
frighteningly 
little 
about 
(When We All Fall Asleep, 
Where Do We Go? anyone?). 
Although the endings appar-
ent in my own life may not be 
on par with those of alien inva-
sions or natural disasters, the 
scale is irrelevant in the dis-
section of the feeling itself. 
However brief or insignificant 
in the grand scheme of things, 
endings represent a paralyz-
ing inability to accept the end 
of one chapter of your life and 
transition to the start of anoth-
er.
With “I Know The End,” 
Phoebe Bridgers closes her 
sophomore album, Punisher, 
with not only a bang but also a 
whimper. She plunges straight 
into the depths of the murky 
waters of inevitability, life after 
death and how we as human 
beings cope with the ending 
of things big and small. Bridg-
ers watches the final scenes of 
intimate relationships in her 
life play out and encapsulates 
her ironic refusal to revel in the 
downtime, to make the most of 
staying at home doing nothing 
after months of longing for just 
that. (Yes, her pre-quarantine 
predictions were eerily spot-on 
and you can do with that what 
you will.)
As a cluster of details makes 
up the minor endings in Bridg-
ers’s own life, we catch glimps-
es of the outside crumbling in 
parallel ruin. Just as a break-
up is finalized, she knowingly 
foreshadows 
a 
catastrophic 
event on the horizon. It’s not 
an if, but a matter of “when the 
sirens sound.” We gradually get 
a sense of the larger forces at 
play here as images of a desert-

ed town reside in the back-
ground of her own awareness 
that “not even the burnouts are 
out here anymore.”
Ever an agent of the apoc-
alypse 
at 
heart, 
Bridgers 
acknowledges the usual sus-

pects, questioning whether an 
unnamed object hovering in 
the sky is a “government drone 
or an alien spaceship.” Her eva-
sive response of “either way, 
we’re not alone” is forebod-
ing and has an ominous rather 
than comforting connotation. 
It’s not so much about how the 
world ends, but what we are left 
with after. The specifics have 
no real consequences here as 
she’s far more concerned with 
the ending itself — the accep-
tance of the cataclysmic, earth-
shattering event — in order to 
address the perhaps even scari-
er question: what next?
Like every other standing 
high school senior of the class 
of 2020, I spent much of my 
time post-graduation (or in my 
case, post-makeshift ceremony 
in the bus drive-through of my 
high school) in a stasis of sorts. 
I kept waiting for my mind to 
catch up to my body, to dramat-
ically come to terms with the 
fact that life as I knew it was 
forever gone; that my future 
would resemble very little of 
the 
long-awaited 
post-high 
school plans I had dreamed 
of. The first few months of 
the COVID-19 pandemic were 
weird, but in my head, it was 
still nothing more than a tem-
porary break, a pause from the 
regularly scheduled program-
ming of my reality that would 
soon get fixed by the forces 
that be. I kept busy with school, 
talked with friends on the 
phone for hours and patiently 
watched my prom dress gather 
dust hanging from the closet 
door.
By the time summer hit, 

things had begun to perma-
nently set in. I was reeling from 
the loss of a loved one after 
months of separation from 
friends and relatives, and I was 
constantly anxious about start-
ing a so-called new chapter in 

my life when the last one had 
seemingly never ended. I was 
exuding nervous energy, end-
lessly frustrated and bogged 
down by a growing restlessness 
and longing for a portion of my 
youth that I felt was unjustifi-
ably snatched from me right as 
I reached the precipice. There 
was none of that closure every 
Bildungsroman I had grown up 
reading and watching had so 
earnestly promised. No gradu-
ation ceremony, no prom, no 
final school musical. No happy 
ending. I knew they were 
inconsequential things in the 
long run, but they could only 
grow in stature as I built them 
up in my head instead of living 
them out in reality.
Naturally, I spent far too 
much of my time mourning 
what a petty waste my 17th 
year around the sun was. These 
unresolved thoughts and feel-
ings raced around my mind 
unabated by not only the rem-
nants of the senior year I did 
have but the imminent pros-
pects of my freshman year of 
college. The coming-of-age sto-
ries that I usually sought such 
comfort in only served to fur-
ther fuel my depressive spiral-
ing and bitter resentment that 
this isn’t how things were sup-
posed to be.
Listening to “I Know The 
End” for the first time was like 
something clicked into place. 
It communicated this feeling 
I couldn’t quite seem to put 
into words, of grappling with 
the ending of a thing you saw 
coming all along, but some-
thing that still hits you with 
a sudden shock all the same. I 

got lost in Bridgers’s vividly-
imagined chaos, soaked in the 
sadness and tried to process it 
all. It’s difficult not to get fully 
submerged in the song itself; 
Bridgers’s 
immersive 
detail 
in her writing only makes the 
mutual catharsis of experienc-
ing her musically-actualized 
apocalypse all the more viscer-
al for the listener.
For once, someone wasn’t 
sugarcoating it. My own inner 
melodrama could make it feel 
as though the world was col-
lapsing in on itself and the neg-
ative energy I was bottling up 
inside of me was desperate for 
expulsion. I didn’t need some-
one to tell me it was all going 
to be okay because everyone 
in the world had just unani-
mously decided that it was, in 
fact, not going to be okay in 
the slightest. I was 17 years old 
and had nothing figured out, 
but I wasn’t supposed to. The 
problem was that no one else 
had it figured out, either — not 
even the people that I thought 
always did.
Although Bridgers’s apoca-
lyptic ending is certainly not 
a happy one, it felt more akin 
to an embodied dreamscape 
than a nightmare, a cinematic 
experience I projected upon 
heavily within the walls of my 
childhood bedroom. The first 
half of the song floats along 
with Wizard of Oz references 
and wallows in the circum-
stances of endings itself — the 
end of a tour in one verse, a 
break-up in another. But her 
eyes keep glancing to the hori-
zon as she iterates, “I gotta go 
now / I know, I know, I know.” 
In the midst of it all weighing 
down on me, that same rest-
less energy buzzed about, that 
urge to risk everything just for 
a chance to peek over the edge 
of the cliff and catch a glimpse 
of what was waiting beyond.
It was this nagging desire 
to pack it all up and make a 
change, any change at all. What 
resonated with me most was 
the fact that in the midst of all 
of Bridgers’s resolutions, she 
seemingly had nothing figured 
out. And that was where I was 
at, unable to go back to the way 
things were before, but with 
no real way to move forward. 
She so precisely captures the 
sensation of feeling as though 
you have nothing left to do but 
stand directly in the eye of the 
storm and scream it out.

THEY SAY THAT a slow death 
is worse than a sudden one, that in 
those last seconds when your life 
flashes before your eyes, you are 
at peace. A meteorite, a car crash, 
a dream becoming the last place 
you’re in. They tell you to picture 
it as if you’re a frog placed inside a 
pot with water gradually getting 
hotter — the bubbles growing 
exponentially bigger, until you’re 
so immersed in the heat that you 
no longer feel a thing. Numbed by 
the stretch of time, blinded by the 
vagueness with which you swam 
in the water, you realize, it’s too 
late. 
The gamut of doomsday pre-
dictions has always resulted in 
failure. I recall calling my par-
ents “one last time” on Dec. 12, 
2020, from my overcrowded 
boarding school dorm in Dub-
lin, Ireland. Between sobs was a 
hardly intelligible “I read about 
it on the internet,” while they 
tried to pacify a baby in the body 
of a preadolescent. The Last 
Judgment, Halley’s Comet, the 
evangelists, your crazy neigh-
bor, a book you read, a movie 
you recently watched starring 
Leonardo DiCaprio. Irony within 
truth. A distant future, peering 
around the corner.
But what if, instead of envi-
sioning the apocalypse as some-
thing sudden, a blink of an eye, 
a last gasp, I told you the apoca-
lypse was here already. Go ahead, 
turn the other cheek — it’s habit-
ual by now. Picture this: You’re 
no longer a frog, but yourself, in 
your college dorm. You notice 
the empty box of Cheez-Its that 
has been sitting between the blue 
recycling and the black garbage 

bin for days now. In the heat of 
a snowless November, you real-
ize you neglected the stimuli that 
told you that danger was com-
ing. The bliss of winters becom-
ing milder and springs becoming 
warmer. The summer: infernal, 
perpetual, wilting. 
Why wait for a sudden death 
when you can avoid death alto-
gether, by impeding the world 
from looking like this, or this or 
this? Science fiction, alas! Per-
haps the following seem more 
conceivable: Evidence of Hades’ 
wrath in a wildfire in Madera 
County, Calif. Remnants of what 
used to be a seaside neighborhood 
in Mexico Beach, Fla. ‘Highway 
River’ AKA a morning commute 
to Detroit with the wrong means 
of transportation — boats weren’t 
on offer that Friday. 
Here’s the punch line: You 

just have to open your eyes. Per-
haps you need something to help 
you do so. I intended to make my 
take on the apocalypse a simple 
story about how climate change 
is depicted through art and how 
it has become a means to unravel 
historical turning points. Unfor-
tunately, climate change is not 
a turning point, but a series 
of missed exits, reckless lane 
switching and closed-eye speed-
ing on a wrong way street. Our 
current apocalypse is, thus, not 
one single event, but a myriad of 
ludicrous and thoughtless tribu-
lations. Road rage at its finest, 
except the ones getting mad are 
the good guys, and the ones who 
don’t mind are the bad guys. 
In our fight with the environ-
ment, silence becomes too costly 
an expense; the price of words is 
weighed down by an hourglass 
that is running out. In the age of 
information, science, truth, tech-
nology and innovation we choose 
to turn inarticulate, primate, 
taciturn and ignorant. Because 
no one wants to accept that if this 
apocalypse wipes out the human 
race, the Earth will continue on 
creating new ecosystems — ones 
in which there is no place for 
us. They will speak of us as we 
speak of the dinosaurs, and they 
will recall the 21st century with 
as much brevity as we word “Ice 
Age.” 
In the first lockdown back in 
2020, while every single citizen 
of Barcelona was confined to the 
four walls of their home, while 
life was put on hold and it felt 
like the world stopped spinning, 
COVID-19 meant nothing to the 
millions of species we share a 
planet with. A video of three wild 
boars meandering in city streets, 
dolphins spotted on the coasts, 
virgin sights of the LA mountain 

skyline… the Earth went through 
rehab while we fought to find 
new drugs to cure ourselves.
Even then, I found myself com-
ing back to the works of Alexis 
Rockman, a New York-based 
artist who has been depicting 
pre- and post-human scenarios 
where common sites such as Cen-
tral Park or the Brooklyn water-
front take on different meanings 
with the demise of modern civi-
lization. In Manifest Destiny, a 
24-foot long omen, Rockman pic-
tures the East River, 200 feet tall-
er, engulfing the Brooklyn Bridge 
as jellyfish and eels inhabit the 
places men used to — a decaying 
scene in which mankind is now a 
fable to the evolving species that 
remain unfazed.

POETRY HAS THE ability to give us 
strength in our darkest times and reflect 
our joy in our happiest moments. For 
evidence, just look at the outpouring of 
gratitude for Amanda Gorman — Presi-
dent Biden’s inaugural poet — and the 
virality of her poem “The Hill We Climb.” 
The line “For there is always light, if only 
we’re brave enough to see it. If only we’re 
brave enough to be it,” seemed to encom-
pass both the despair and the hope so 
many Americans were feeling on that 
day, just two weeks after armed rioters 
stormed the capitol. That is the power 
of poetry. So if you feel like you’re living 
through an apocalypse — the seemingly 
never-ending COVID-19 pandemic, polit-
ical turmoil, deep divides in American 
society, threat of war, climate change, 
police brutality, a collective mental 
health crisis or whatever other calamity 
you can think of — here’s some poetry to 
help carry you through.
“Dearly” by Margaret Atwood
Margaret Atwood is perhaps best 
known for her 1985 novel “The Hand-

maid’s Tale,” a searing criticism of 
Western rape culture and restrictions 
on reproductive freedom. She turns that 
same keen eye to her poetry — though in 
the several decades that have passed, it 
has been molded, not dulled, by age’s wis-
dom. Now 82, Atwood speaks to today’s 
crises in her most recent poetry collec-
tion, “Dearly,” with both her character-
istic wit and anger and a sort of gentle, 
pleading hope. Her poetry encapsulates 
what this era is and could become: the 
ongoing fight for women’s rights, the 
looming climate catastrophe, the grief of 
losing a loved one and our current politi-
cal situation. But despite its heavy topics, 
her poetry does not produce a helpless 
feeling; instead, it makes you want to 
fight even more.
“What the Living Do” by Marie 
Howe
“What the Living Do” tells the frag-
mented story of youth, how our child-
hoods shape us into who we are and 
how we come to learn what living is 
all about. Written for her brother, who 
died of AIDS-related complications in 
1989, “What the Living Do” is imbued 
with a sense of wonder for life — all of 
its pain and joy and in-betweens. It does 

not attempt to make everything rosy; it 
knows how difficult this all is, how tiring 
it can be to keep going day after day with 
the small frustrations and regrets piling 
up. But it also shines light onto the under-
side, the part that we often let collect dust 
as we alternate between slogging away 
and sleeping: the heartwrenching beauty 
of this short, short time we have together. 
Howe’s poetry speaks best for itself: “We 
want the spring to come and the winter to 
pass. / We want / whoever to call or not 
call, a letter, a kiss—we want more and 
more and then / more of it. / But there 
are moments, walking, when I catch a 
glimpse of myself in the / window glass, / 
say, the window of the corner video store, 
and I’m gripped by a cherishing so / deep 
/ for my own blowing hair, chapped face, 
and unbuttoned coat that I’m / speech-
less: / I am living. I remember you.”
“Unearth [The Flowers]” by Thea 
Matthews
“Unearth [The Flowers]” is a book for 
today’s moment of collective outrage and 
action. Matthews, a Black Indigenous 
Mexican poet, does not shy away from the 
grief and anger born from colonization, 
militarism and patriarchy. This is not an 
easy read — the violence she describes 

left a sickening feeling in my stomach. But 
the poems are, at their roots, vignettes of 
survival and resilience. How does one 
heal when the injuring is ongoing? How 
does one reclaim their body, their life? 
With each poem named after a flower, 

Matthews shows how people can bloom 
even through the darkest moments, 

how we will always plant our roots and 
reach towards the sun: “My roots now 
/ strengthened my bones in formation / 
I emerge slowly uprising in the night. I 
rise / in the glimmer of untamable waters 
/ I live.”

Content warning: Character death, vio-
lence, spoilers for “The Walking Dead” 
THE GLOBAL PHENOMENON AMC 
television series “The Walking Dead” 
(Robert Kirkman) was once one of the 
most highly rated television series on 
air. “The Walking Dead” follows zom-
bie apocalypse survivors Rick Grimes 
(Andrew Lincoln, “Penguin Bloom”), 
Maggie Greene (Lauren Cohan, “Invinci-
ble”), Glenn Rhee (Steven Yeun, “Minari”) 
and an ensemble of a few dozen other 
characters as they clash with the brain-
eating monsters and other survivors alike. 
Despite its acclaim, the show has some-
what faded from the public eye in recent 

years. The adventures of protagonist Rick 
Grimes and company inevitably become 
dull as similar plot threads are repeated 
and a large portion of its original cast 
is killed off. Still, “The Walking Dead” 
remains a guilty pleasure of mine, regard-
less of this decline in quality. Watching 
the world end for Rick Grimes, though 
often a complicated viewing relationship, 
has taught me how to prevent my own 
from ending. 
It all started one blistering summer 
afternoon some four or five years ago. In 
search of an escape and a quick thrill, my 
mother and I embarked on our first epi-
sode of the acclaimed series, not know-
ing what lay ahead of us. One episode 
was enough to have us wrapped around 
Grimes’s finger. A weekly routine became 
a nightly binge which became an insatia-

ble obsession. 
We turned into Walkers ourselves, des-
perate to feast on any Walking Dead con-
tent we could get our hands on. Thanks 
to my mother’s Netflix subscription and 
the DVD section of my hometown’s pub-
lic library, this hunger engulfed our sum-
mer with an intensity akin to infatuation. 
Now, years later, I am both proud and 
embarrassed to say that I have watched 10 
seasons of “The Walking Dead,” six sea-
sons of the spinoff-prequel series, “Fear 
the Walking Dead” and (unfortunately) 
one season of “The Walking Dead: World 
Beyond.”
As time went on, the magic of the first 
five or six seasons wore off, and watching 
“The Walking Dead” became increasing-
ly daunting. I was continually force-fed 
unnecessary character deaths and con-

trived storylines. There have been mar-
ginal improvements in recent seasons, but 
too many aspects of the show are twisted 
unrecognizably from their origins; all 
but two original cast members have been 
killed off or left the show. “The Walking 
Dead” became the television embodiment 
of the Ship of Theseus. I was no longer 
watching the same show I fell in love with.
As “The Walking Dead” has experi-
enced somewhat of an apocalypse of its 
own, the COVID-19 pandemic raged on 
and created a world that was hauntingly 
similar to the desolate landscape depict-
ed in the show. At its best, “The Walk-
ing Dead” underlined the importance of 
found family and connection through 
adversity. Like Rick Grimes and his group 
of survivors, the only way I could weather 
this apocalypse was with the aid of fam-

ily. 
My mother and I watched every single 
episode of the nearly 200-episode series 
together; we cried together, we screamed 
in terror together, we expressed our 
disappointment together. When a gut-
punching cliffhanger left us in awe, we 
would revel in it. When a string of bad 
episodes left a sour taste we could always 
turn to each other to complain. Sharing 
the strenuous viewing experience made 
it more than bearable, even when “The 
Walking Dead” was at its worst. Watch-
ing the show with my family during the 
pandemic was one of the only things that 
kept me sane; the escapism of a fictional 
apocalypse helped me cope with the real-
ity of the global pandemic.

Life lessons from Rick Grimes and his zombie apocalypse

Our current apocalypse 
can’t be escaped in fiction

THE APOCALYPSE OF the past 
two years was marked in my life, not 
just by the COVID-19 pandemic, but 
by the subjects of the books I read. 
I began reading more consistently 
during this time and found myself 
deep in a genre of existential stories 
that, whether or not I realized it at 
the time, added still more apocalyp-
tic material to my darkening view 
of the world. After Kurt Vonnegut’s 
“Slaughterhouse-Five,” the injustice 
of war was stamped into my brain 
on top of the rising COVID-19 cases. 
After Michael Cunningham’s “The 
Hours,” it was sickness and sadness 
and the fact that the human condition 
had begun to appear fractured. These 
and other novels left me unsettled by 
the passage of time for longer than 
I’d care to admit. I loved books like 
these, anxious and pessimistic as they 
made me. They altered my thinking. 
I felt changed by the authors’ use of 
language, which was powerful and 
mesmerizing. They were beautifully 
written, and they meant something. 
There was no question for me that 
they were worth my time.
Yet as the pandemic dragged on in 
the real world, and the insurmount-
able worldly problems and existential-
ism piled up in the fiction I consumed, 
I began to long for an escape. I loved 
these books, but I needed a break 
from them. I wanted to be happy 
while reading, not because I liked the 
writing or because of Vonnegut’s dry, 
satirical humor, but because the sto-
ries themselves were happy. I wanted 
a book that was cozy and exciting. 
I wanted fluff. I wanted romance. I 
wanted characters to root for who got 
what they wanted in clear-cut ways 
that I didn’t need to struggle to wrap 
my mind around.
So, I set out to find a cute, fluffy 
romance novel. It couldn’t be too hard, 

I thought. Not a big romance reader 
myself, I turned to the BookTubers 
I watched, and they almost unani-
mously recommended Talia Hibbert’s 
“Get a Life, Chloe Brown.” I checked 
it out from the library with perhaps 
unattainably high hopes.
I liked “Chloe Brown” well enough, 
but it wasn’t everything I had dreamed 
it would be. I tried to be invested in the 
story, to care whether the characters 
ended up together, but the reality 
was that I wasn’t. I couldn’t shake the 
feeling that the story didn’t matter. I 
doubted it would deeply affect me in 
any way. I didn’t want this to be true. 
I certainly didn’t want to be someone 
who couldn’t enjoy romance novels 
because they weren’t heavy and dense 
and “serious.” I desperately wanted to 
care about Chloe and her love interest, 
Red. I tried to fend off my ambiva-
lence to the story, but in the end, it 
was impossible. I looked for other 
romance novels, but none appealed 
to me much more. I followed this fail-
ure with a string of thrillers — a genre 
I once loved — but the ones I chose, 
highly recommended as they were, 
felt generic; they felt like nothing spe-
cial and I stopped reading most after 
a few chapters. I didn’t want to read 
another heavy book yet. I still wanted 
something fun, but for one reason 
or another, I didn’t enjoy the books I 
thought would fit this description.
While deciding to write this for 
The Michigan Daily, I realized that 
I needed to think of a book that had 
saved me. A book that had felt both 
meaningful and worthwhile and 
been truly energizing to read — fun 
in a non-depressing way. I knew that 
I must have read such a book during 
this time, and finding it was the logi-
cal conclusion to this piece. Racking 
my brain, thinking of every piece of 
fiction I read in the last two years, I 
could not find anything that fit the bill.

The anonymous art of the University’s public pianos

I saw it online: 

The importance of 

digital communities 

at U-M

I sit on the gray, pleather couches 

in the East Quad Residence Hall 
lobby, passing time between a class 
and a virtual meeting. The long glass 
windows behind me tell me it’s gray 
outside; I wouldn’t be surprised if it 
started raining. 

A fellow college student strays 

from the lobby’s traffic patterns 
and pivots toward the space’s 
musical focal point: the glimmering 
Yamaha grand piano. They set their 
backpack down to the side, adjust 
the simple black bench and rest their 
hands on the reflective keys. A few 
chords are played as a warm up, and 
the music soon turns into a Hans 
Zimmer melody from “Interstellar.” 
After some repetitions, the tune 
changes to an early 2010s pop hit 
I can’t remember the name of, 
modulating again into something 
lush and classical-like, the sounds of 
a modern Mozart. 

I pretend to type on my keyboard 

while the pianist plays on theirs, and 
perhaps 15 to 20 minutes later, the 
song ends and the musician leaves. 
There is no bow, no applause, no 
fanfare, for this is nothing out of the 
ordinary. It’s a typical performance 
on the East Quad public piano.

There are versions of this scene 

scattered throughout the University 
of Michigan’s campus. You can try 
the dark, polished upright piano 
tucked down a hall in the Michigan 
Union, or the multiple sitting within 
the various spaces of Pierpont 
Commons. For dinner and a show, 
visit the dimly lit seating area in the 
rear of South Quad’s dining hall; 
the worn down wood grain seat of 
the instrument and mood lighting 
gives the appearance of a popular 
underground music venue while you 
eat meal-plan pizza. You are in the 

audience by default, so why not lean 
in and enjoy?

***

A year after my family moved to 

Michigan, my mom commandeered 
her childhood upright piano from my 
grandfather’s living room, placing 
it in our own where it now sits. My 
brother and I took lessons on it while 
in elementary school, and though 
they halted when I turned twelve, 
my fondness for the instrument 
never did. I played almost every day, 
especially when I didn’t have school. 
During the summer evenings, my 
arpeggios would float through the 
open windows, harmonizing with 
the symphony of cicadas outside. 

In the months leading up to 

my first fall at the University of 
Michigan, I frequently thought 
about how I would play the piano 
once I moved out of my parent’s 
house. I daydreamed, perhaps too 
optimistically, of dazzling the East 
Quad lobby and touring my talents 
around the residence halls. My high 
school hobby would blossom into 
something publicly popular, quickly 
cementing my status as a university 
icon. 

Upon my arrival in Ann Arbor, 

though, other hopeful musicians had 
similar ideas and more advanced 
skills. And upon hearing them play, 
I was overcome with jealous dread, 
deciding the public keys were not for 
me. 

In the past month or so, however, 

realizing 
my 
access 
to 
these 

instruments is fleeting, I’ve forced 
myself to step up to the bench and 
play music in public. The moment 
I decided to do this I became 
incredibly nervous. My limbs forgot 
how to do their job and my eyes 
darted around the room, trying to 
uncover reasons I shouldn’t perform. 
I walked up to the keyboard but then 
quickly turned around, worried to 

offend, eager to eliminate anxiety. 

How does everyone else make it 

look so easy? What are the comforts 
in being so publicly visible? 

***

To investigate such feelings, I 

interviewed some campus public 
pianists, all of whom were within 
a variety of stages and majors in 
their college careers. What makes 
these musicians so compelling 
is the fleeting nature of their 
performances. 
They 
start 
and 

end without notice, except for the 
overheard chords of a spontaneous 
setlist. 
Their 
programming 
is 

a mashup of your favorite pop, 
classical and throwback playlists, 
but unlike your Spotify music player, 
the name of the artist is nowhere to 
be found. 

Despite their lack of disguise, the 

pianists camouflage with the rest 
of the student body moments after 
playing their final chord. In an era 
where musical artists are aligned 
with their visual brand as much as 
their melodies, the campus piano 
player approaches the stage with the 
clothing of normality. 

Some 
of 
these 
anonymous 

sensations 
have 
other 
musical 

outlets, like a cappella groups or 
bands, and some had collaborators. 
LSA 
sophomore 
Will 
Chehab, 

who also records rap under The 
Young XP, started early in making 
the pianos a part of his campus 
experience, playing in Stockwell 
Residence Hall and on the grand 
in the East Quad lobby during his 
freshman year. 

“I had a friend who also played 

piano, he was really good, we liked 
to mess around for an hour or two,” 
Chehab said. 

LSA 
senior 
Thomas 
Martin 

told me about “a little piano gang” 
that formed during his first year 
on campus, when a passerby 

recognized the “Fourth Chopin 
Sonata.” 

“She sits down and starts playing 

the same thing … I mean, as a lot of 
friendships in college occurred, it’s 
not like we saw each other every 
day. But, we’re still friends,” Martin 
said. 

Behind the allure of musical 

recognition is the opportunity for 
genuine and lasting friendship. 
Though others may see the piano 
player as just that, knowing them as 
people helps break down the barrier 
between audience and performer. 
Some 
moments 
of 
connection 

are much more fleeting, but are 
just as gratifying because of their 
unexpectedness.

Engineering graduate student 

Dan Maguire said, “I definitely have 
people come up to me a lot and say 
thank you for playing … Someone 
once left a note for me.” 

When asked about the note, 

Maguire smiled and picked it up 
from its spot on his desk, reading: 
“Beautiful playing, thank you for the 
music. Hope you have a wonderful 
day.” The message concluded with a 
hand-drawn smiley face, providing 
something comfortingly genuine on 
a folded piece of notebook paper.

All of the piano players I 

interviewed indicated they are 
repeat performers on campus, 
with Martin going as far to imply 
it was his self-appointed job. 
“The University doesn’t pay me” 
he conceded, but described the 
routine musical acts as a kind of 
“addiction.” 

Chehab had a similar sentiment, 

saying the sight of the piano poses 
enough of an incentive to play: 
“I look at it and (think) I 
kinda want to play this, and I 
go in and play. It’s usually pretty 
spontaneous.” 

There is a sort of rugged 

individualism a person must have 
to initiate their own performance, 
to create something grand out 
of 
ambivalent 
silence. 
Dexter 

Kaufman, LSA sophomore and 
member of the Southeast Michigan 
band Luna Pier, told me the 
experience is quite different from 
being on stage with his group. “At 
the piano you’re by yourself, you can 
play at any tempo you want, all the 
keys are in front of you,” Kaufman 
said. 

However liberating the freedom 

of no-strings-attached performance 
is, the inherent self-promotion of 
spontaneous song must be carefully 
balanced with the needs of an ever-
changing campus audience. When 
a quiet study space unintentionally 
doubles as a de-facto performance 
hall, chaos can ensue. Maguire 
told me of a time when another 
musician’s act was stopped at the 
request of an irritated study group. 

“It was kind of really sad, I felt so 

bad for the guy … I imagine a lot of 
other people were really enjoying 
it,” Maguire said. 

Indeed, the flip side of anonymous 

praise and the serotonin it brings is 
the harsh bite of faceless critique. 
The campus piano player, 
though relatively free from 
the repercussions of 

identity, must take time to 

consider the effect of their sounds 
on the room to dodge unwanted 
scrutiny. Maguire tries to cater 
to the hypothetical piano skeptic, 
saying “I’m careful to play agreeable 
music … If it’s really crowded that 
day I’ll be like ‘nah,’ I’ll pass today, 
I don’t want to annoy people too 
much.” 

This consciousness extends to the 

other performers as well. Martin, 
who, like other interviewees, plays 
for hours at a time, sees it as a matter 
of continuing the musical tradition: 
“I’ll have to balance my addiction to 
play with everyone else who goes 
here, (so they can) get what I got 
(from the pianos).” 

The lack of artist recognition 

associated with this particular 
type of performance allows the 
impromptu stage to be claimed by 
anybody and for anybody, for as long 
as they want. As Kaufman stated 
simply: “(It’s) just a public piano, 
anyone can use it.”

Following Kaufman’s sentiment, 

it seems the pianos can occupy two 
paradoxical spaces in the public 
consciousness: they are meant to be 

played and heard, 

and 
their 

performers 

are 

aware 
of the 

effect 
their 

music has. 

But, 
they 

also 
bend 

some 
of 
the 

most basic rules 

of 

social 

It’s a common refrain on campus: 

“I saw on the U-M subreddit that”, 
“There’s a rumor going around in 
my class group chats”, “Did you see 
the Facebook post about”.

Running 
parallel 
to 
official 

sources on campus — University 
press releases, emails and The 
Michigan Daily — there is an 
informal, crowd-sourced ecosystem 
of digital circles: the U-M subreddit, 
posts on Yik Yak, Discord servers 
and countless others.

These spaces are difficult to 

characterize. Their collaborative 
nature and emphasis on community 
norms make them distinct from 
other social media. They aren’t quite 
meme pages, but they aren’t overly 
serious. They’re conducted mostly 
by students, but professors are 
known to lurk in the background. 
There’s 
a 
social 
element, 
but 

most users are strangers to one 
another. Still, users with a range of 
academic backgrounds, interests 
and motivations coexist in these 
spaces, tied together by their 
common identity as members of the 
University of Michigan community. 

Since 
my 
freshman 
year, 

I’ve been an atypical producer 
and 
consumer 
in 
Michigan’s 

information ecosystem. I spent 
three years working on The Daily’s 
audience engagement team, which 
is responsible for managing the 
newspaper’s social media presence, 
posting 
breaking 
news 
and 

publishing newsletters. Simply put, 
my job was to get news to students. 
Getting our stories circulating in 
group chats and online communities 
was crucial. During my tenure, I 
learned that if a story isn’t a meme 

or the topic of a discussion thread on 
platforms like Reddit, it’s not really 
circulating on campus. 

Having been both an information 

producer and consumer, I’ve seen 
how information can take on a life 
of its own in digital spaces. The 
U-M subreddit, various student-
run Discord servers and a collection 
of Facebook groups fill in the gap 
between 
information 
that 
has 

been endorsed and vetted by the 
University and external publications 
like MLive and The Daily.

Always Online
Information junior Ari Feldberg 

is always on Discord. “In my room 
on my desk, I have two monitors. I 
have a bigger main monitor, then I 
have a second monitor with pretty 
much just Discord open,” he said. 

Discord was released in 2015 

as a messaging platform targeted 
towards video game players, but 
has since grown to include features 
like video- and voice-calling. It’s 
split off into servers, which are 
smaller communities with their 
own members, moderators and 
rules. University-specific servers 
have popped up on campuses across 
the nation as a way for students to 
connect with one another.

Thanks to his persistent use of 

the platform, Feldberg became the 
owner of the U-M server in 2019, 
giving him access to essentially 
everything on the server. Felberg 
can change the group’s settings, add 
moderators and remove members 
at his discretion. When he joined, 
the group belonged to an entirely 
different team of moderators and 
was more or less inactive: “The 
previous owners just gave it over to 
someone else because they’re like, 
‘Okay, you guys are active and you’re 
gonna fix the server.’”

Since then, the U-M Discord has 

grown to over 5,000 members and 
has channels for everything from 
politics to off-campus housing to 
sports. In practice, Feldberg is the 
server’s lead moderator, taking 
on most of the responsibility of 
monitoring acidity on the Discord 
and ensuring that users follow the 
group’s rules. Moderators are the 
border patrollers of the digital world; 
the gatekeepers who decide what 
kind of information and discussion 
gets to be on the platform. 

Feldberg 
said 
he 
takes 
a 

“relatively 
hands-off 
approach” 

and despite constantly being on 
Discord, he spends very little time 
actively moderating the group. He 
also shared he typically doesn’t 
intervene in heated discussions so 
long as parties are “arguing in good 
faith.” 

Engineering sophomore Casper 

Guo knew about the U-M subreddit 
before he was even active on the 
platform. Subreddits are individual 
communities devoted to a specific 
topic within Reddit. The platform 
is made up of millions of subreddits 
with distinctive cultures and norms.

“I literally made my Reddit 

account because I wanted to see 
the [U-M] Reddit,” he shared. Guo 
couldn’t recall exactly how he had 
found out about the subreddit. The 
group has been around since 2010 
and has 34,000 plus members — just 
larger than the population of 32,282 
undergraduate students on the Ann 
Arbor campus. 

Like Guo, no one told me about 

the subreddit, or the Discord or any 
other 
student-run 
communities. 

It’s a testament to the ubiquity — 
and sometimes, the invisibility — 
of these spaces. It’s up to students 
to stumble across the University’s 

digital communities.

While some users like Feldberg 

invest 
time 
into 
moderating 

and 
cultivating 
digital 
spaces, 

these communities are generally 
characterized by low barriers to 
entry. 
Online 
content 
creation 

generally 
follows 
a 
power-law 

distribution, with a few users 
contributing the majority of the 
content. Guo observed that, on 
the U-M subreddit, “it’s the same 
names that keep coming up,” and he 
contrasted these active-participants 
with “most people who occasionally 
post maybe asking for classes or 
asking for professors.” 

Still, with an account, some 

motivation 
and 
enough 
posts, 

anyone can become a recognizable 
power-user, while the majority of us 
sit back and watch the feed unfold. 

Knowledge & Norms
Every 
semester 
when 

backpacking begins, I find myself 
instantly turning to the U-M 
subreddit.

I had a four-year plan color coded 

and organized in a spreadsheet 
before I even began college. During 
my freshman year, you could’ve 
asked me what I’d be taking as a 
senior, and I’d answer in earnest. 
But I quickly learned that even if 
you know exactly what you’ll be 
registering for, the subreddit has 
something that you’ll never find on 
the LSA Course Guide — insider 
information about nearly every 
class. If the professor is boring, if the 
homework is too long or if discussion 
attendance is mandatory, someone 
has probably posted about it. 

When I asked Feldberg about 

the value of informal spaces like 
the Discord, he quickly mentioned 
classes. He said that communities 
like 
the 
U-M 
Discord 
raise 

awareness for things that “the 
University isn’t going to tell people, 
Like, no, do not take intro classes. 
Terrible idea. Do it at a community 
college. The University isn’t gonna 
tell people to do that, whereas 
current students or former students 
or alumni, they would all have that 
experience.”

But 
not 
all 
majors 
and 

departments are well represented 
in the subreddit. Guo critiqued the 
page for being “EECS-centric,” 
noting that most posts are made by 
and for computer science majors. 
“The post I made asking about 
linguistics classes, I think I got like, 
maybe two comments. The other 
majors don’t really have the same 
sort of presence on Reddit,” Guo 
said. 

While there’s no hard data on the 

page’s demographics, moderators 
have instituted a policy that posts 
asking about courses must include 
the department name, largely as a 
response to the constant stream of 
users asking about “281, 370, 445,” 
referring to common courses in the 
EECS Department.

I am not an EECS major. But I’m 

interested in posts about recruiting 
for tech internships and doing 
research, which are common on 
the page. I’m a statistics minor, and 
as the department is decently well 
represented in the group, I can 
usually find useful information. 
I can benefit from the subreddit 
because my interests are close 
enough to the stereotypical engineer 
major the page caters to. The 
subreddit provides a rich knowledge 
base for a certain type of student, but 
has less utility for others.

These digital communities are 

crucial in disseminating information 

across campus, but that’s not their 
only purpose. They are, first and 
foremost, a space for members of 
the Michigan community — a space 
which became especially important 
to students over the course of the 
pandemic. 

Cliff Lampe, a professor in 

the School of Information whose 
research specializes on social media 
and social computing, speaks on the 
value of fostering social connections 
during this stage in our lives. 

“Part of the college experience, 

in fact, one of the best parts of the 
college experience, is building social 
capital,” Lampe said. Social capital 
is a sociological term that refers to 
the trust, reciprocity and shared 
values that allow our interpersonal 
relationships to function. Social 
capital manifests as friendships, 
professional connections or access 
to opportunities. In a way, social 
capital is analogous to that certain 
something that we all feel is missing 
from online learning.

Lampe went further to say that 

the connections we make in college 
“provide value often throughout 
(our) life; (we) make lifelong friends. 
How do you do that over Zoom, 
right? How do you build meaningful 
friendships via technology?”

The students I spoke to had 

mixed experiences forming social 
connections in digital spaces. When 
Feldberg first began using the U-M 
Discord, in-person meet ups were 
more common. Now, he says these 
virtual interactions have moved to 
smaller groups specific to students’ 
graduating classes.

When you are young, anything 

is 
possible. 
Princesses 
fly 
on 

magic carpets, fairies lurk in the 
depths of every forest and animals 
seem to always seem to be able to 
speak fluently. There is no greater 
liberation than being a child, mind 
open to the possibility of anything 
and everything. Pure, (literally) 
unadulterated 
imagination. 

Freedom. 

Any day my Hogwarts letter would 

come, or I’d find the fifth Golden 
Ticket, surely to be whisked away to 
the wonderland I always envisioned 
for myself. A vivid imagination, in 
awe of every tree and cloud and Polly 
Pocket doll in all their other-worldly 
wonders. 

I don’t know when I lost that 

imagination, but I mourn it every time 
I sit down to write. At some point, the 
creative person I considered myself 
to be changed, presumably from a 
child to an adult. The girl who once 
spent recess writing a short story 
about a koala ballerina from space 
now cannot produce a 100 word 
poem for class without restlessly 

searching her brain for something 
exciting. 

But how did this happen? Not just 

to me, but to many, both “creative” 
types and not? How do we lose our 
childlike magic, and where does it 
go? Does it fade into the sky, leaving 
us bare?

Losing our imagination begins 

with the psychological changes that 
underscore the shift from childhood 
to adulthood. In our younger days, the 
mind is effortlessly transformative. 
University 
Professor 
Frederick 

Amrine gives the mundane example 
of a saucepan, which children can 
interpret as virtually anything they 
desire.

“The young child is just so 

wonderful,” he explained. “Take 
a saucepan. Well, you know, the 
saucepan isn’t just a saucepan, it’s 
a boat, it’s a hat. It’s fungible; the 
young child weaves a sort of magical 
aura around this saucepan, and it can 
become almost anything.”

Gradually, Amrine explained, the 

child sees its caretaker use a saucepan 
over and over and over again in the 
exact same way. Place it on the stove, 
let the flame blaze and serve up your 
creation. Eventually, the child is 

gradually induced into ditching the 
saucepan’s metamorphic potential 
and simply seeing the object for its 
practical function. 

Through 
a 
combination 
of 

psychological 
processes, 
social 

learning and cultural expectations, 
we slowly grow accustomed to what 
exactly it means to be a child; we 
learn where the line of “growing up” 
is drawn.

Through the process of social 

learning, we are conditioned into 
the confinements of our decided 
age group. As we move out of 
childhood (roughly ages 0-12) and 
into adolescence (roughly ages 
13-19), we learn what is deemed 
socially acceptable for our particular 
age range and are encouraged to 
act accordingly. And at one point or 
another, the majority of us are told 
to put down the Legos and crayons 
in search of more “mature” pursuits; 
rather, those that fit our perceived 
expectations for adulthood.

And growing into adolescence 

typically 
means 
developing 

an 
acutely 
controlling 
self-

consciousness. We start to notice 
what makes us feel different from 
others, whether it be our bodies, 

hobbies or our perceived social 
statuses. Our insecurities take center 
stage, leaving our imaginations to 
wait in the lobby, sell snacks during 
intermission and commiserate. 

Rather than continue to create 

worlds of our own, we become 
preoccupied with the one in front of 
us: namely, the social spheres under 
which we operate. The “imaginary 
audience,” defined as the adolescent 
belief that others are constantly 
focusing on them, pushes us to 
conform to the world around us to 
prevent embarrassment or shame. 

Hence 
why, 
according 
to 

Psychology Professor Daniel Keating, 
abandoning the liberal individuality 
of childhood is often inherent to the 
nature of adolescent insecurity. 

“(Adolescence) is a psychosocial 

thing. It’s what you’re thinking about 
yourself, and what others think of 
you,” Keating said in an interview 
with the Daily. “The adolescent peer 
experience, with all of its dominance 
hierarchies 
and 
struggles 
with 

popularity, sharpens what one would 
imagine one’s ideal self to be and 
what the world is going to accept.”

It’s a tale as old as time: a wide-

eyed child who loves to play make 
believe subconsciously transforms 
into a teen who would rather stay 
quiet in an unfamiliar circle of peers. 

Take 
Ohio 
State 
University 

freshman Talia Moses’s experience, 
for example: “[When I was little], I 
had notebooks on notebooks of plays 
and stories that I wrote. I was super 
into theater, which really allowed me 
to express myself,” she said. 

But coming into middle school, 

discomfort around her peers led her 
to abandon what had once been her 
primary creative outlet. 

“I think that as I got older, I 

thought I would get judged for being 
a theater kid or something like that,” 
Talia described. “And because of that 
I didn’t want to be associated with 
that or have people know what I was 
doing so I just let it go.” 

LSA sophomore Lilah Shandel 

shared a similar sentiment.

An avid reader and writer as 

a child, Lilah actively hid her 

imaginative side once she entered 
high school in an effort to better ‘fit’ 
into her social environment. 

“Honestly, when I was in middle 

school, my friends made fun of me a 
lot. Because I liked (books and that) 
kind of stuff. And in high school I 
saw a way to reinvent myself a little 
bit,” she said. “So I was like, ‘Oh, 
maybe I won’t be that girl who reads 
under her desk all the time when the 
teacher is teaching.’ I’m just gonna 
keep my head down and do what 
everyone else is doing. And maybe 
I’ll have friends that way.”

The adolescent experiences of 

Talia, Lilah and others like them 
are positioned in a society that sees 
imagination as something to grow 
out of. Beyond the more concrete 
neuroscience behind “growing up,” 
societal notions of what exactly being 
a child means impact our connection 
with the imaginations we were once 
closely in touch with. Through our 
experiences with others, we begin 
to internalize these expectations and 
allow our imaginations to fall to the 
backburner of our ever-busy minds. 

***

Working as a camp counselor 

for a group of 10-year-olds this past 
summer, I had the opportunity to 
watch “growing up” in action. For 
some, the age of 10 was just another 
year of experimental play and 
creativity. The “mature” 10-year-
olds might have crushes on the 
older boys and test out every curse 
word. Among lifeguards, counselors 
and head staff, the latter campers 
were the center of attention in 
conversation, showered with praise 
for their “adultlike” personalities. 
The former went unnoticed.

My campers were not alone in 

being encouraged to participate 
in the activity of “growing up:” 
becoming familiar with the “real 
world” and its consequences and 
complexities. 

Wanting to be an astronaut is a cute 

ambition when you’re in elementary 
school. Yet suddenly, 10 years later, 
you are being encouraged to use your 
scientific skills to go through medical 
school instead. It’s practical; it makes 

logical sense for establishing a stable 
income and daily life. Or, that’s what 
we’re told. 

***

Like Lilah and Talia, I, too, ditched 

my notebooks filled with bizarre 
short stories to engage with the ups 
and downs of middle school social 
life. Almost a decade later, exiting 
late adolescence and moving into 
young adulthood, I find myself 
yearning for the simplicity of my 
childhood, cursing my insecure 
middle school self for minimizing 
the magic with which I once saw the 
world. But slowly, I have discovered 
that imagination is not gone forever. 
Instead, it is lost — waiting to be 
found again. 

And life’s only a matter of how we 

go about finding it. 

Lilah, having gotten back in 

touch with her love for fantasy in 
college, explains that a supportive 
environment has provided her with 
the space to do so. 

“I was so lucky last year to meet 

the people that I met,” she said. “And 
people who really pushed me to do 
what I wanted to do and not what 
other people like, or what I thought 
other people wanted me to do.”

As a naturally exploratory life 

stage, young adulthood (roughly 
ages 18-25), provides us with the 
opportunity to find the communities 
that best serve our most authentic 
selves. Additionally, it gives us the 
space to engage with the ideas that 
intrigue and excite us, especially 
those we may have thrown to the 
wayside during a more uniformed 
adolescence. To Amrine, regaining 
our imagination is an active process, 
one to be taken on with love and 
patience. 

“The world is imaginative and (a) 

young child sort of imbibes that. But 
then the adult actually has to develop 
imagination from the inside out,” 
Amrine explained. “So they have to 
actually expand once faculties again 
and make them more mobile.”

Michigan in Color
8 — Wednesday, February 23, 2022 

Well, here we are again. I 

can’t say I’m surprised; I don’t 
even think I’m disappointed. 
Deep down, I knew it was only 
a matter of time before more of 
the National Football League’s 
(NFL) corruption would come 
to light to prove, yet again, that 
no matter how many helmets 
they print “end racism” on, the 
NFL is, without a doubt, racist. I 
was hopeful that the next piece 

I would write about the NFL 
would be to praise some of my 
current favorite quarterbacks 
that have completely changed 
the game. Patrick Mahomes, 
Lamar Jackson, Kyler Murray 
and Russell Wilson, I’m talking 
to you. Unfortunately, another 
instance of systemic racism in 
the NFL has been brought to 
light with a recent lawsuit by for-
mer Miami Dolphins head coach 
Brian Flores.

Flores has sued the NFL claim-

ing the organization was racially 
discriminatory in its head coach 
hiring process. He alleges that 
the owner of the Dolphins, Uni-
versity of Michigan’s own Ste-
phen M. Ross, of the Ross School 
of 
Business, 
offered 
Flores 

money to purposely lose games 
in the 2019 season. Having more 
losses than wins would better 
the Dolphins’ chances of acquir-
ing a higher draft pick, allowing 
them to select the best upcom-
ing player for the future of their 
franchise. However, Flores was 

focused on having a successful 
season by winning, not by manip-
ulating the future NFL draft. 
Every time Flores and his team 
would win games, the Dolphins’ 
general manager would express 
anger towards him, claiming 
that he was hurting the team. 
With his commitment to the cur-
rent success of his team, Flores 
recorded back-to-back winning 
seasons with the Dolphins for 
the first time since 2003. Despite 

the immense success he brought 
this organization, on Jan. 10, the 
Dolphins fired him, on grounds 
of being considered difficult to 
work with.

Then, as he began seeking a 

new job as a head coach, Flores 
attended interviews with the 
New York Giants and the Den-
ver Broncos. Flores had a Zoom 
interview with the Giants and 
was given a date for an in-person 
interview in the near future. 
However, before this interview, 
he was informed through a text 
by one of his old colleagues that 
someone else had received the 
position. The NFL has a rule 
called the Rooney Rule, which 
states that its teams are required 
to hold an in-person interview 
with at least one minority or 
female candidate for a general 
manager or head coach posi-
tion. This means they were still 
required to hold the interview, 
only for him to find out that 
someone else was offered the 
position a day later, implying 
that the decision had already 
been finalized before Flores’s 
interview. Flores states he had a 
similar experience in interviews 
with the hiring managers of the 
Denver Broncos, further alleging 
that the interviewees arrived an 
hour late and were hungover. 

In addition to his success-

ful seasons with the Dolphins, 
Flores has had a triumphant 
coaching career with other NFL 
teams. As an assistant coach, 
defensive coordinator and safe-
ties coach for the New England 
Patriots, he has won four Super 
Bowl titles. Many of the players 
he has coached rave about how 

supportive and compassionate 
he was to them. His past col-
leagues have even stated that he 
is dedicated “to doing things the 
right way. He never cut corners… 
He’s always been a guy that’s 
been level, never too high, never 
too low. That’s what made him 
a great player, and that’s what’s 
making him a great coach.” 
Flores has an incredible résumé 
and numerous accolades to his 
name; having recently been fired 
from the Dolphins being denied 
these two head coaching posi-
tions is questionable consider-
ing the large impact he has had 
on the organization in his time 
there and the potential he brings 
for its future. 

The NFL has a long history 

of racial discrimination against 
Black coaches. The fact that the 
Rooney Rule exists just to check 
a box to say that a marginalized 
individual was taken into con-
sideration shows its corruption. 
Flores having been fired because 
he was labeled difficult to work 
with, a common way of devalu-
ing Black people in professional 
settings, shows the NFL’s dis-
criminatory ways. I hope he is 
given the justice he deserves. 
The NFL is long overdue in 
enacting actual systemic change 
and owning up to its apparent 
discrimination. But instead of 
focusing solely on all the ways 
this institution is corrupt, I want 
to now call attention to some of 
the amazing and talented Black 
coaches in NFL history and pres-
ent day.

Hue Jackson is a former coach 

of the Cleveland Browns who had 
an impressive coaching career. 

As a testament to this, Jackson 
won the 2015 NFL Assistant 
Coach of the Year award and has 
played an integral role in the suc-
cess of franchises he has been a 
part of. Former colleagues praise 
him for his industrious mentality 
and overall commitment to play-
er development. However, Jack-
son claims to have had the same 
experience as Flores in his time 
with the Browns. The Browns 
offered him money to lose games 
and were successful in their goal 
of acquiring high draft picks; 
but Jackson was fired from his 
position in the 2019 season. He 
now serves as the head coach of 
Grambling State’s football team. 

The Pittsburgh Steelers’ Head 

Coach, Mike Tomlin, has given 
this 
organization 
consistent 

success in his 15 seasons with 
the Steelers. Tomlin made his-
tory in the NFL this most recent 
season by setting the record for 
the most consecutive non-losing 
seasons at the beginning of a 
coaching career. He has seven 
American Football Conference 
(AFC) North Division titles, two 
AFC titles, has had nine playoff 
appearances and is the youngest 
coach to win a Super Bowl. He is 
one of the longest-tenured active 
head coaches in the NFL. Tom-
lin is praised by his players and 
fellow NFL coaches for how well 
he controls and commands his 
team. Mike Tomlin still remains 
the head coach of the Steelers. 

As a Lions fan, I have a soft 

spot for Jim Caldwell. Though 
there has not been much to cel-
ebrate in Lions history, Caldwell 
gave Detroit hope for a brighter 
future during his time here as 

a head coach. At the beginning 
of his career with the Tampa 
Bay Buccaneers, he trained its 
quarterback, 
Brad 
Johnson, 

and in turn, Johnson broke 
team records for passing yards, 
completions and attempts, help-
ing the team to finish with a 
winning season and a National 
Football Conference Wild Card 
spot. He served as part of the 
coaching staff for seven years 
with the Indianapolis Colts, and 
head coach for another three 
years. In nine of these seasons, 
the Colts set records by appear-
ing in nine consecutive playoff 
appearances in which they won 
six AFC South titles and made 
it to two Super Bowls, winning 
one. Later, serving as an offen-
sive coordinator for the Balti-
more Ravens, Caldwell led the 
team to a Super Bowl win. Final-
ly, in his time with the Detroit 
Lions, the defense ranked sec-
ond in the NFL in total defense 
in 2014, making it one of its best 
defensive teams in Lions history. 
He was also the Lions’ first non-
interim coach to leave the team 
with a winning record since the 
1967-72 coach, Joe Schmidt, with 
two playoff seasons. He was 
fired from the Lions in 2017 on 
grounds of not being successful 
enough against higher-ranked 
teams for the then general man-
ager, Bob Quinn. Jim Caldwell 
was the Lions’ most successful 
coach in almost 30 years. Two 
coaches have since gone on to 
take his place, but they have 
failed to even reach Caldwell in 
his success. 

I love clothes. My night-time 

routine involves plugging music 
into my ear and muting out all 
my thoughts because at the 
end of a long and stressful day 
of classes, I get to unwind and 
focus on creating my next day’s 
outfit. At the end of a long day, 
what I want to focus on most are 
the clothes in my closet. I spend 
a few intimate moments curat-
ing what I want to wear and how 
I want to wear it. I want to look 
good for me, myself and I. 

Today, my fashion inspira-

tion comes from the rappers 
I listen to, the skateboarders I 
keep up with, the N.B.A play-
ers I imitate and Mexican L.A. 
street style. Artists like Kanye 
West, Tyler, the Creator, Frank 
Ocean, skaters like Louie Lopez 
and Sean Pablo and athletes like 
Kevin Durant put together out-
fits that make them shine bright. 
Each has a unique and signature 
style, inspiring me to curate my 
own. There’s a tension, however, 
between being truly unique and 
conforming to the trends of soci-
ety.

Over the years, I’m sure 

you’ve come across the “Aes-
thetic Starter Pack” meme. It’s a 
collection of clothing pieces that 
are associated with a particular 
type of person. It’s interesting to 
see how people categorize them-
selves, others and their person-
alities based on a particular set 
of clothing. When I go out to 
skate, I put on my beanie, button 
up shirt and loose flowing pair of 
pants to pull off a classic skater 
boy look. It’s fun and easy, but I 
want to push myself to not fall for 
the trends too heavily. Though 

thrifting, I’m able to experiment 
with my clothes and avoid cur-
rent trends by acquiring time-
less pieces. Thrifting allows me 
to enter my own fashion world 
and find my own style in a finan-
cially stable and sustainable way. 
I’m creating my own collection 
of clothes that speak to me. I 
find confidence in who I am by 
what I wear, and finding my own 
style fuels an ongoing journey of 
authenticity. When I look good 
and feel good about myself, I can 
feel better on my skateboard or 
on the basketball court.

When I am thrifting, my 

eyes are constantly adjusting, 
moving from left to right as my 
fingers comb the clothing racks 

in search of my next purchase. 
It takes time, but I search for 
pieces that call to me. It could 
be a smaller fitting shirt that 
complements my skinny frame 
or an oversized dress shirt that 
drapes over my arms. I’m always 
looking for polos of all different 
shapes and sizes or pants that 
are baggy enough to cuff and fit 
nicely over my sneakers. Thrift-
ing appeals to me because you 
can become the owner of a piece 
that is one of a kind. Thrift stores 
are not like the stores at malls, 
where there are hundreds of 
shirts in all sizes with the same 

graphic. These clothes come 
from dusty basements and can 
be generation-long hand-me-
downs. And, if someone doesn’t 
love or want their piece of cloth-
ing, I’m able to take it in and care 
for it. 

One particular piece of cloth-

ing that I care deeply for came 
from the city of Detroit. When I 
lived in Detroit this past summer, 
I explored the city and visited 
all the thrift stores and vintage 
shops to find my next catch. I 
learned about the city’s history 
and gained a greater apprecia-
tion for its culture. Detroit loves 
its sports teams, with the Detroit 
Pistons playing such an impor-
tant role in the city’s culture. 

The Pistons are three-time 
world champions. From the 
Bad Boy Pistons winning two 
championships in the late 80s 
to beating the Shaq and Kobe 
duo in 2004, Detroiters love the 
Pistons and living in Detroit 
made me become a bigger fan of 
the team. On weekends when I 
wasn’t working at my internship, 
I would bike down to Tolan Park 
and play basketball on a court 
designed with Pistons decals. I 
would join pick up games with 
the people from the city and play 
for hours. I was playing basket-
ball in Detroit while listening 

to some of my favorite Detroit 
artists like Baby Tron and Flint 
rappers like Rio Da Yung Og. 
My love for the city, and the Pis-
tons, made me want to thrift and 
find vintage Pistons pieces, so I 
embarked on a search. 

A few blocks from Tolan Park 

is Eastern Market. This farm-
ers market is filled with food 
vendors on Saturdays, but on 
Sundays, the sheds become a 
space for vendors to sell their 
art, clothes, jewelry and more. 
One vendor, Brandon’s Vintage 
Basement, had my attention the 
moment I laid my eyes on the 
clothes racks stuffed with vin-
tage Detroit sports teams shirts. 
Vintage tees can be expensive 
— ranging from $50-$200 — 
but I was always aware of my 
budget. I kept drifting back and 
forth from this stand through-
out the day, finding myself star-
ing at the shirts on the rack and 
debating if I should purchase a 
Detroit Pistons shirt. I eventu-
ally had to ask myself, ‘when will 
I ever be living in Detroit, on my 
own, spending the summer in 
the city?’ My summer in Detroit 
would be coming to an end, and I 
needed something to remember 
it by. I finally purchased a black 
shirt with the classic Pistons 
logo from the 90s, even though 
it was more pricey than usual, 
because I knew that I would love 
and wear that shirt until it wore 
down to its final thread. And far 
later that summer, I also found a 
championship hat from the ‘04 
Pistons title run. When I bought 
this hat, I knew that I was paying 
for a quality hat that, to me, had 
a deeply sacred and historical 
meaning. 

1. What you need: flour, yeast, water, 

salt and olive oil. Focaccia is a no-brain-
er for beginner bakers. It’s the perfect 
bread for college students who commute 
back and forth between classes and club 
meetings. The yeast respiration allows 
the dough to rise in the fridge overnight, 
without excessive kneading or complica-
tions. 

2. My mother says only food sticks in 

my memory. Her secret noodle recipe 
which became a go-to whenever we were 
too lazy to cook. The individual drops of 
rice swimming in the porridge for my sick 
days as a child, with a perfect consistency 
achieved from being boiled on low heat 
for hours. The vegetarian bao, bursting 
with bok choy, shiitake mushrooms and 
tofu, that she and I always picked up on 
Friday afternoons in Shanghai. She hates 
that I forget to bring my homework to 
school, but never the packed lunch. She 
hates that I forget she’s a light sleeper 
when I lurch into the kitchen at 2 a.m., 
shoving Kirkland Mixed Nuts down my 
throat until my heartbeat slows. 

3. Measure yeast and mix it with room-

temperature water. Using warm water 
nurtures the yeast and helps it grow. 

4. My mother’s birthplace is named 

after its proximity to water. The area of 
the country is, which is “South of the 
River” in Chinese. The women of 
 

were known to be honey-voiced, moon-
skinned with hips that homed oceans 
and swayed liked fishtails. We know this 
because male poets wrote about them 
for dynasties. My mother was raised by 
her grandparents on sticky rice rolls that 
wrapped youtiao, marinated egg, zhacai, 
yellow croaker noodles and shengjianbao. 
Later, she moved to Beijing for schooling, 
where her parents worked as aerospace 
engineers.

home province, named after the state of 

 from the Spring and Autumn period. 
But the only seasons I remember of his 
city are the summers and winters, when 
my family visits for the holiday. My father 
comes from the land of black vinegar, 
knife-sliced noodles, millet porridge and 
coal mines. My mother told me that he 
never tasted fish before the age of 12. The 
eldest son in a peasant family of six, my 
father was his family’s pride for attending 
a top college in the capital. After gradu-
ation, he drifted toward the seaside and 
settled there, where he gradually grew 
accustomed to the breakfast xiaolongbao 
and plum rain.

my grandparents never approved of my 
father. They say he eats like someone 
who starved to death in their past life. 
He slurps up noodles like a hurricane 
demolishing a village and gulps down his 
rice with the force of a ghost general who 
can make things disappear into thin air. 
They trace his crude manners to his peas-
ant lineage, saying no matter how smart 
a monkey is, it can only paddle in the 
ocean. My grandparents always called me 
a fat Shanxi girl, because I bear no resem-
blance to the women of . Whenever 
I ask for more rice, they take my bowl to 
refill it. But the bowl that appears before 
me is only half-full, with a familiar warn-
ing that crawls up behind my ear: “Don’t 
eat too much, or else you will be like your 
father.”

Bala hasad, Yasmine, say Smallah so you 

don’t give ayn”

This is a phrase that has been regurgitat-

ed to me throughout my life. When compli-
menting family and friends, I have always 
been careful to not cast the “evil eye” onto 
someone. Whether I have been conscious 
of it or not, the evil eye has played a signifi-
cant role in how I talk to and coexist with 
others.

The evil eye: a sacred phenomenon and 

the superstition of all superstitions. In my 
religion and culture, the evil eye is a widely 
held belief. It is a malicious gaze cast by an 
envious person, preventing one from good 
health and fortune by sending negativity 
their way. In order to be protected from 

hasad, or evil, various cultures have pro-
moted wearing or displaying the symbol 
as a form of defense. Over the course of 
my life, my home was littered with evil eye 
wall decor and I was constantly gifted evil 
eye jewelry by my loved ones. I was taught 
to bless others after giving compliments 
so as not to cast evil or bad fortune upon 
them. If my evil eye decor or jewelry were 
to break, I’d quickly become suspicious; 
legend has it that if your evil eye emblem 
breaks, it has successfully protected you 
from someone’s ayn or harmful “eye”. I 
would wonder, “has it really served its pur-
pose?” After, I’d promptly replace my pen-
dant, whether that be a necklace, anklet, 
bracelet, ring or keychain. Believing in this 
protection from evil almost became second 
nature to me, treating the evil eye as not 
only a superstition, but a way of thinking 
that translated into my everyday life. This 

easily discernible symbol, composed of a 
royal blue outer circle, white midsection 
pupil and small black iris, is more than just 
a colorful work of art. However, over time, 
the evil eye has lost its historical signifi-
cance, becoming more of a fashion fad than 
religious and cultural hieroglyph. 

The evil eye stems far beyond popular 

culture. Dating as early as 5,000 years ago, 
the first-ever recorded evil eye was marked 
on clay tablets by the Mesopotamians. 
Intersecting both culture and religion, 
wariness of evil is found in the scriptures 
of various religions — Islam, Judaism, Bud-
dhism and Hinduism (among others) — 
while also dating back to ancient Greek and 
Roman cultures. From the beginning of 
civilization, humans have feared a harmful 
gaze, doing whatever was in their power to 
protect themselves and their families from 
evil.

As a practicing Muslim, the evil eye 

has always been something I am wary of. 
I’ve been taught to be careful of the lan-
guage used when complimenting someone, 
almost always blessing them afterward 
with Islamic reaffirmations such as 
Mashallah and Smallah, in order to pre-
vent their good fortune from being jinxed. 
Throughout my life, I have gifted friends 
and family with variations of evil eye pen-
dants as protection from evil. As I write 
this, I am wearing an evil eye necklace and 
gold bracelet with multiple evil eye pen-
dants interlinked together. To some, this 
symbol ignorantly serves as a cute jewelry 
piece — an uninformed infatuation with 
cultural symbols without actually bearing 
the weight of carrying that culture. For 
those who practice the culture it originat-
ed from, the evil eye serves as a protective 
measure from harm they may not be aware 

of. In Islamic culture, the Hand of Fatima 
and the evil eye symbol are equal signs of 
protection that have reappeared hand in 
hand throughout my life. I often see new 
parents pin an evil eye charm to their new-
born child’s clothes, while others hang the 
Hand of Fatima or evil eye symbol in their 
new homes or business establishments. 
Some may even choose to dangle the sym-
bol from the rearview mirror of their car. 
Protection from hasad or “destructive 
envy” is a recurring theme in Islamic cul-
ture. Both religiously and culturally, the 
evil eye holds tremendous weight for those 
who believe in it, serving as much more 
than a trendy wardrobe fad, later to be 
found in a pile of other short-lived “fash-
ion must-haves” in the back of someone’s

ipartisan 
support 

for 
stock-trading 

bans on members of 

Congress has risen in the last 
year, largely due to the several 
violations of the Stop Trading 
on Congressional Knowledge 
(STOCK) Act just weeks before 
the COVID-19 pandemic hit 
the United States. Insider trad-
ing is illegal, and the STOCK 
Act prohibits members of Con-
gress from utilizing “nonpub-
lic information derived from” 
their position to trade stocks. 

Former Sen. Kelly Loeffler, 

R-Ga., as well as Sens. Richard 
Burr, R-N.C., Dianne Feinstein, 
D-Calif., and James Inhofe, 
R-Okla., were accused of insid-
er trading in early 2020. Even 
before this, an investigation 
by The Wall Street Journal 
yielded hundreds of instances 
in which “(federal judges) or 
their family members owned 
shares of companies that were 
plaintiffs or defendants in the 
litigation” over which they 
presided. 

Public backlash stemming 

from this show of government 
corruption has given rise to 
widespread agreement within 
Congress to restrict legisla-
tors’ trading, particularly with 
individual stocks. Just last 
week, House Speaker Nancy 
Pelosi’s, D-Calif., flippant dis-
missal of any restrictions was 
met with both public and pro-
fessional backlash before she 
reluctantly agreed to further 
action to stronger regulations. 

As we approach congressio-

nal elections this November, 
the incentive for many elected 
officials to address the issue 
of stock trading restrictions is 
becoming apparent. A ban on 
members of Banning lawmak-
ers from trading stocks has 
the support of around three-
quarters of the electorate, 
making it an easy political vic-
tory to support it. Naturally, 
legislators must now address 
how these restrictions will be 
put into place, what they will 
restrict and whom they will 
impact. 

A proposition embraced by 

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cor-
tez, D-N.Y., calls for assets to 
be set aside into blind trusts to 
be managed by a family mem-

ber or friend. Unfortunately, 
blind trusts have not histori-
cally done a great job of pre-
venting conflicts of interest, 
with possible loopholes for 
active trading influenced by 
congressional business. Per-
haps 
the 
most 
prominent 

example of the dangers of 
blind trusts came with Presi-
dent Trump, who repeatedly 
came under fire for the unlike-
lihood 
of 
wholly 
unbiased 

decision making when he gen-
erally knew what the assets in 
his blind trust were composed 
of.

A more tenable framework 

might be found in the Federal 
Reserve regulations released 
following recent trading scan-
dals that led to the resigna-
tion of multiple Fed governors. 
By banning the trading of 
individual stocks, bonds and 
cryptocurrencies, the updat-
ed standards limit governors 
to index funds and diversi-
fied equities. By restricting 
investments to highly diver-
sified positions, even mem-
bers of Congress who take an 
active role in the management 
of their investments will be 
mostly unable to act in ways 
that bolster their portfolio.

By extending this ban to the 

spouses and direct dependents 
of members of Congress, most 
direct conflicts of interest will 
be covered under new legisla-
tion. While by no means com-
prehensive, such regulations 
would be a tremendous step 
towards 
accountability 
and 

restoration of trust in Con-
gress. 

With this framework in 

mind, another major consid-
eration in any new legislation 
is enforcement, which remains 
poorly addressed by existing 
regulations.Although 
public 

backlash can incite change on 
multiple levels in the behav-
ior of individual members of 
Congress, much more must be 
done at the legal level in terms 
of “punishment” for insider 
stock-trading offenses. 

The goal of the 2012 STOCK 

Act was to increase transpar-
ency between the public and 
members of Congress, requir-
ing officials to file disclosures 
concerning their trading activ-
ities. Under this law, members 
of Congress are banned from 
gaining any “nonpublic” infor-
mation when it comes to stock 

trading, as they are public citi-
zens in their roles as elected 
officials. Still, politicians con-
tinue to ignore these rulings, 
rather unashamedly using pri-
vate information to trade and 
keeping their trade maneuvers 
out of the public eye. Change is 
needed in terms of transpar-
ency and efficacy. 

Multiple plans of action have 

been introduced in the Senate 
surrounding punishment for 
insider trading offenses, rang-
ing from economic punishment 
(such as paying a fine similar 
to or more than your salary in 
Congress), to criminal punish-
ment (like jail time). In the 
middle is a proposition intro-
duced by Sen. Sherrod Brown, 
D-Ohio. Brown’s bill, the “Ban 
Conflicted Trading at the Fed 
Act”, would fine offending 
members of Congress at least 
10% of the value of the stock.

This measure, among oth-

ers concerning enforcement of 
said law, seems like an accept-
able 
middle 
ground 
when 

it comes to punitive action 
against insider stock trading. 
It puts a heavier burden on 
those wealthy politicians who 
do not rely solely on the ben-
efits of the stock exchange and 
does not significantly harm 
those middle-class representa-
tives who rely on smaller, less 
frequent investments. In the 
end, no politician is seriously 
fiscally damaged, but they are 
taught a lesson: their insider 
trading is recognized, and a 
fine establishes that this is not 
acceptable to the general U.S. 
population.

The issue of insider stock 

trading by members of Con-
gress is a bipartisan one, both 
in terms of offenders and 
opposition. These investments 
are the antithesis of the role of 
“public servant” these officials 
serve. Offending politicians 
are profiting off of their posi-
tion of political power. In ban-
ning representatives and their 
immediate dependents from 
such investments, and taxing 
direct offenders, there may be 
better financial transparency 
and trust amongst the people 
and their government. Public 
service is what we have elect-
ed them to do, not a private 
smoke-filled-room 
business. 

There need to be consequenc-
es.

From The Daily: Congressional 

stock trading needs reform

C

ollege will be the time of 
your life.” A sentiment 
that 
every 
teenager 

has heard multiple times in 
their life. For high schoolers, 
it serves as a justification for 
a less than satisfactory high 
school 
experience. 
For 
new 

college students, it provides hope 
that the next four years will 
be unforgettable. And for the 
students reaching the end of their 
college years, it can be two things: 
a truth, or a “what could have 
been.”

After 
completing 
my 
first 

semester of college, I stopped to 
consider this expectation. In so 
many ways, college has exceeded 
my expectations. I didn’t have 
a big, close-knit friend group 
in high school, nor did I spend 
my weekend nights at parties 
or on unforgettable adventures. 
Instead, my closest friends and 
I navigated high school in a 
different way; we played sports, 
focused on school, hung out 
at each other’s homes and on 
weekends spent time outdoors, 
whether we were hiking, surfing, 
skateboarding or something else 
(this remains one of the main 
perks of the Bay Area). My first 
relationship was a long, peaceful, 
healthy one with one of my 
best friends. Looking back, this 
lifestyle contained all the aspects 
of true happiness, yet at the time, 
I felt unfulfilled. Where was the 
chaos of the American teenage life 
I had been so conditioned to want? 

College took a sharp 180. 

Within one month, everything 
about my life had completely 
changed. Every second I wasn’t 
studying or sleeping, I was being 
social. Romantically, I had guy 
and girl drama in every corner, 
and for the first time I felt like 
someone that people could truly 
be attracted to. My instagram 
slowly filled up with pictures of 
me and my new friends at football 
games, parties and other events. 
I could finally do what I wanted 
without my parents checking my 

location, being home by curfew or 
constantly having to prioritize my 
safety. It truly was the American 
teenage dream, so I should have 
been the happiest I’ve ever been, 
right?

What wasn’t shown on my 

social media stories or texts home 
to my friends, however, was the 
other side. The endless hours 
spent crying at random places 
around campus, the anxiety of 
wondering if my friends liked 
me, the never ending pressure of 
college classes, the relationship 
drama 
that 
consumed 
my 

thoughts, the feeling of being 
too far away from my family 
and my home, the hate for the 
way I looked and the complete 
overwhelmingness of being in a 
new state, in a new school, with 
new friends and absolutely no 
sense of familiarity. 

When we search for happiness 

in college, we are truly looking 
for distraction. Stress is released 
when we become too intoxicated 
to remember our problems and 
continue the facade we put on 
for the week. We wear clothes 
we hope will make others like us, 
because we yearn for validation 
from them instead of giving it 
to ourselves. When homework 
becomes too much, we go on a 
“5 minute” TikTok break that 
suddenly morphs into hours, then 
we are consumed by the guilt that 
follows. When the world feels 
like it’s ending, we search for our 
friends to help us push that feeling 
off for a bit, until it returns later. So 
much of the idealized large state 
school experience is derived from 
students finding ways to distract 
themselves from the anxiety that 
comes with entering such an 
overwhelming new environment. 

The issue then, is the feeling 

of being alone. When everyone 
around us curates this image 
of having so much fun, and our 
parents or aunts and uncles keep 
reminding us how revolutionary 
their college experience was, 
we feel like failures when it’s 
not perfect. Yet, we are often 
portraying the same image in 
an effort to fit into the puzzle, 

all it takes is one conversation 
with any student to realize that 
this portrayal is not true to life. 
So why don’t we have these 
conversations?

As a society, we are working 

towards a goal of destigmatizing 
mental 
health, 
however, 
one 

important topic often gets left out 
of the mental health conversation: 
struggling without a diagnosis. 
One of the things that has 
consistently held me back from 
truly reaching out to my friends 
and asking for help when I need 
it is the fact that I suffer from no 
mental disorders. A feeling of 
guilt arises when I feel hopeless, 
because I feel that whatever I’m 
feeling must not be as bad as 
those who have diagnosed mental 
illnesses. So I do what many of 
my peers do: push away what I’m 
feeling for as long as possible. 
When 
that 
feeling 
returns, 

however, it feels bigger and more 
dangerous. And so the need 
for a distraction becomes more 
imminent. 

So let’s learn to talk about it. 

Let’s learn to ask our friends 
how they are and reach out in 
moments of crisis. And let’s erase 
this idea of college being the 
most perfect time of your life. 
That doesn’t mean we shouldn’t 
work to find happiness, because 
there is so much happiness to be 
found in college. I’ve met friends 
so far in my first semester that I 
hope will be the friends my kids 
call “auntie” and “uncle” in 30 
years. I’ve made memories I can 
imagine reminiscing over at the 
dinner table years in the future. 
In just one semester, I’ve learned 
so much about my academic 
interests, and I’m excited to 
learn more. But these things 
don’t come from intoxication, 
or letting everyone on my social 
media know I’m having a great 
time. 
They 
come 
from 
the 

moments when I’m not thinking 
about what others think, or if I’m 
doing enough academically and 
extracurricularly. The first step 
to truly being happy is living life, 
instead of distracting ourselves 
from it.

Happy or distracted?

EDITORIAL BOARD 

A

s 
someone 
who 

occasionally 
scrounges Yik Yak 

for funny content, there is an 
unending source of “looking-
for-someone” posts. The app 
is anonymous and annoying to 
scroll through, but it’s easy to 
recognize patterns. You find 
things like: “Are there any 
other gay girls on campus? 
Asking for a friend,” or, “how 
do u meet wlw in aa, please 
help,” constantly — especially 
on weekends. It seems the 
queer women on campus need 
rest, too. 

According to “The Statement 

2021 Sex Survey,” more than 
30% of University of Michigan 
students 
surveyed 
did 
not 

identify 
as 
heterosexual. 

That’s a lot of queer people, 
but how do you meet them? 
It’s really not easy. Unless you 
already have an entire network 

of 
gay 
people 
you 
found 

during your freshman year on 
accident or brought from high 
school (like I did), then you 
must resort to Bumble, Tinder, 
Her or maybe even that one 
girl your roommate thinks is 
bisexual. 

And once you have found 

someone, what do you do? 
There are not many helpful 
queer 
dating 
how-tos 
for 

college-aged 
students 
right 

now. There are online articles 
about where to find other 
queer people, and there is Yik 
Yak, where an anonymous 
asker may meet an anonymous 
answer. Dating is already hard 
enough for us teenagers and 
20-somethings. Queer dating 
is even harder, and meeting 
your very own queer network 
is a whole different bag of 
worms. 

Living in Kerrytown, the 

unofficial-official Ann Arbor 
gay-borhood, I have a lot 
of access to queer people. 

While I have never visited the 
Spectrum Center on campus, 
nor any organized queer club, 
I still live in a bubble of Gay. 
I often forget that there are 
people on campus who do not 
have at least five other gay 
friends, and I wonder, are 
these the people on Yik Yak? 
The Spectrum Center and more 
general queer-student clubs 
are not popular with the people 
around me. One of my friends, 
a bisexual man, tried the 
club oSTEM (Out in Science, 
Technology, Engineering, and 
Mathematics), and left after 
freshman year. Being on Zoom 
for an hour once a week was 
not a meaningful way to meet 
new people for him, nor did 
the year before make him any 
new queer friends. 

The people on Yik Yak 

looking 
for 
hookups 
and 

relationship 
advice 
aren’t 

going to these places either. 
They are going on Yik Yak 
and 
@collegefessing 
on 

Instagram. 
These 
places 

hold an anonymity that the 
Spectrum Center does not. I’d 
like to believe that other clubs 
have more successful social 
opportunities for queer people 
when they invite anyone to 
come. For example, I recently 
went to the United Asian 
American 
Organizations’ 

(UAAO) 
“Femme 
+ 
Queer 

Skate” in early November. It 
still did not feel like a place 
to meet people, but it was fun 
to go to with another queer 
friend. There were lots of 
femme queer people, and, while 
some were a part of UAAO, a 
lot were also just interested 
in a non-judgemental skating 
atmosphere. 
One 
of 
the 

organizers told me that there 
were more people signed up 
than she thought there would 
be. I asked her if there would 
be another meeting like this, 
and she said there could be. 
And that was it. 

I don’t know anyone in a 

queer-student club. It often 
seems to me that co-ops are 
more 
queer-friendly 
spaces 

to 
meet 
people 
than 
any 

organized club on campus. 
I wonder if those people on 
Yik Yak simply do not live 
in Kerrytown, or their dorm 
hall during their freshman 
year was not at least half gay. 
Necto’s “Gay Night” for anyone 
18+ seems to be more popular 
with those that are confident 
and outward in their identities 
as queer people. Attending 
Necto’s “Gay Night” myself, it 
did not feel like a place to meet 
friends, especially not friends 
who prefer a Friday night in. 

I know that not every space 

on campus is queer-friendly, 
despite what I may hope is 
true. Not every professor asks 
for your pronouns in your 
introduction, though you can’t 
help but appreciate the ones 
that do. Especially in non-
liberal arts majors, there are 
very few students that you 

may be able to recognize as 
gay in cultural cues or fashion, 
which is why it’s important to 
have places like the Spectrum 
Center and create clubs like 
oSTEM. Unfortunately, I don’t 
think that every lonely queer 
person is going to these places. 
Anonymous 
sites 
like 
Yik 

Yak are more accessible and 
less scary for these people, 
especially during a time of 
such serious health concerns 
with meeting in person. 

For those people on Yik 

Yak who are looking for a 
simple “like” so that they don’t 
feel so alone and are being 
encouraged by other “Yakers” 
commenting 
the 
same 

questions in solidarity: keep 
looking. There are places here 
for you, and there are places to 
find people like you. Whether 
it’s a Co-op, an art class or 
someone with a rainbow pin 
in the library, you can find 
people. Just maybe outside of 
Yik Yak. 

Yik Yak isn’t the place to find queer love on campus

Ethics 101 with Schlissel

Design by Tamara Turner


R

ecently, I pursued a very 
exciting 
opportunity, 

one 
that 
afforded 
me 

the chance to work in an industry 
I’ve loved since I can remember: 
sports. Of all the extracurricular 
opportunities I’ve involved myself in 
this year — professional fraternities, 
sports business groups, writing for 
this awesome paper, etc. — this felt 
different. This was the chance of a 
lifetime, one that could define my 
college career.

One thing you should know about 

me is that when I go after something, 
I go all-in. I’m sure many of you do 
as well. It’s one of the traits which 
defines the student population here: 
when we want something, we go 
after it with a vengeance. So, that’s 
exactly what I did. Networking calls, 
emails, talking to people who held 
the position formerly — everything 
you’re supposed to do, by the book, 
to position yourself in the best way 
possible.

Yet, as I stubbornly pursued this 

opportunity, I found myself growing 
more doubtful. This doesn’t feel 
right, I told myself. What the heck 
is wrong here? As I asked more and 
more questions, I received answers 
which didn’t necessarily excite me. I 
kept scrambling for the right inquiry, 
one that would unlock my lost 
enthusiasm (my original motivation 
for the position). Unfortunately, it 
never came. I realized, throughout 
the process, that more is not always 
better. I chose to affiliate myself with a 
couple of select student organizations 
already; I liked the people I met, the 
objectives of the organizations and 
believed in their respective potentials. 
Quite honestly, I thought I had struck 
gold when, in reality, this should be 

the standard across the board. 

No one should have to feel like they 

are settling. This exact sentiment 
made my emotions all the more 
troublesome. On the surface, this 
athletic opportunity should be my 
dream. However, I turned it down 
because it wasn’t the right fit for me. 
Now, a few days after, I still feel in 
shock. I question whether it will turn 
out to be the right decision. Right 
now, in my gut, I think it is.

defined by Professor Ed Cho, is 
“workers taking the time to search 
for jobs that match their skills or 
tastes.” Granted, at first, this seems 
like an overwhelming, intimidating 
concept. No one should want to 
turn down employment if they need 
it, right? True, although I propose 
that frictional unemployment may 
actually be a positive idea. 

Quite simply, we should pursue 

opportunities that are not only 
engaging, but those that achieve 
this quality without forcing us to 
compromise our well-being. Our 
desire to be involved is one thing; 
seeking commitments which are 
enriching, re-energizing and leave 
us fulfilled after putting in work is 
another. Scott Dust, professor of 
management at Miami University, 
notes that “person-organization fit 
is a strong predictor of whether or 
not someone will be committed to 
an organization in the long-term.” 
Additionally, 
individuals 
who 

experience “higher levels of this type 
of fit typically enjoy being at work 
and connecting with colleagues.”

In my short two years here, I have 

been told to take informal, informative 
interviews seriously as “you are 
interviewing them for as much as they 
are interviewing you.” For the longest 
time, I never understood this advice or 
how to determine whether a position 
is a healthy fit. To do so, I started to 

break down what a responsibility 
entails into comprehensible questions. 
How does this obligation agree 
with my personality and morals? 
Will it allow me to balance my other 
competing 
interests? 
Does 
this 

opportunity provide adequate benefit 
for the time I will put in?

These may seem like basic inquiries 

at first glance, but I discovered that 
answering them truthfully requires 
intricate, complex rationalization. I 
don’t always like my answers, but at 
the very least I know they are sincere. 
Therefore, I believe there is power in 
introspection and, more importantly, 
self-honesty. While the demands of 
our ‘dream job’ may at first seem too 
glorious to pass up, it is important to 
understand who we are as evolving 
individuals; we need not jump at 
our first offer, our second, but rather 
the one which speaks best to our 
personality and lifestyle. 

The sooner we learn to prioritize 

our well-being over what we believe 
to be ‘professionally outstanding,’ 
the better off we will be in the long 
run. Granted, when Fortune 500 
companies are offering six figures 
upon graduation, I understand this 
might be easier said than done. In 
my anecdote, it is not like I would be 
unhappy working within sports. In 
fact, I’d be over-the-moon ecstatic. 
In this role, however, I just would not 
be as excited as I could be, and that, 
personally, is a red flag. If I can’t be 
fair to myself, how can I be fair to the 
organization?

Thus, I encourage you to keep 

digging, keep soul-searching for 
the ‘perfect’ opportunity. Refuse to 
compromise the first few years of 
your professional career for a better 
one later on. Ideally, you should not 
have to accept mortgaging your 
future. Trust yourself now, in the 
moment, and know that everything 
is going to be alright.

L

ooking 
back 
on 
my 

childhood, it’s exceedingly 
apparent that Big Dairy 

propaganda was omnipresent in 
my daily life. My parents always 
reminded me that drinking milk 
makes for stronger bones. Both 
chocolate and regular milk in cute 
cartons with cartoon cows filled 
my school lunches, “Got Milk?” 
campaigns filled the newspapers I’d 
flip through while waiting in line 
at Safeway and my school cafeteria 
decorated its walls with colorful 
USDA dietary guideline posters that 
encouraged students to consume at 
least 3 cups of dairy every day. 

According to these guidelines, our 

government maintains that regular 
consumption of dairy is “associated 
with positive health outcomes” and 
is an excellent source of protein and 
nutrients. While this widely accepted 
“truth” appears to hold merit, there’s 
a concerning amount of information 
being withheld from this argument. 
So, let’s break it down. 

Within 
this 
half-truthful 

argument, 
the 
government 

conveniently forgets to mention that 
the dairy industry is incontestably 
one of the most abusive and 
exploitative toward animals in the 
United States. The image that Big 
Dairy has fed the American public 

of a quaint farmer milking a cow 
while sitting on a pail is intentional 
disinformation, to say the least. 

When female cows are just two 

years old and newly able to give 
birth, they are forcibly inseminated 
by machines. They carry their calves 
for nine months, living in pens with 
concrete floors and hundreds of 
other dairy cows and sleeping in 
piles of manure. Hours after delivery, 
the calf is robbed from the mother; 
if it’s male, it’s sent to a beef farm to 
be raised for meat products, and if 
it’s female, it’s sent to another dairy 
farm to be raised for dairy products. 
The mother would typically produce 
just enough milk for her calf, but with 
the help of hormones pumped into 
her body, she unnaturally produces 
a surplus for market consumption. 
She is connected to a machine with 
suction tubes on her udders and 
milked for weeks until her body stops 
producing. When she can give birth 
again, she is similarly artificially 
inseminated, 
and 
the 
process 

continues until she cannot breed 
anymore. Now, useless to the dairy 
farmers, she is killed and sold for beef 
products. 

Because 99% of U.S. livestock are 

raised in disease-ridden feedlots, 
factory 
farms 
or 
concentrated 

animal feeding operations (CAFOs) 
as previously mentioned, cattle must 
be injected with high amounts of 
antibiotics to fight rampant infection 

within 
these 
heavily 
confined, 

germ ridden spaces. Consequently, 
numerous 
studies 
have 
found 

antibiotic “residue” from dairy cattle 
in a majority of our dairy products.

The human impact of this practice 

cannot be understated. Antibiotics 
in our day-to-day dairy products 
can lead to antibiotic resistance in 
the general public, resulting in more 
costly and prolonged treatment 
of infections, allergic reactions 
(especially if the antibiotic contains 
penicillin), carcinogenic impacts, 
mutagenic effects on female fertility 
and destruction of microflora in 
the intestines — which help to fight 
infection. Inarguably, the inorganic 
practices within Big Dairy that 
translate into its products are 
incredibly costly to human health. 
After being presented with this 
information, the alarming lack of 
transparency within our pro-dairy 
government health organizations 
becomes staunchly evident. 

And even still, the American 

public is urged to consume dairy by 
government health organizations, 
even though all of dairy’s speculative 
positive impacts can be debunked 
by opposing studies. For example, 
though 
government 
health 

organizations like the USDA claim 
that dairy makes your bones more 
resilient, a study conducted by 
New Zealand scientists found that 
there was no association between 

calcium intake from dairy products 
and a reduction in bone fractures. 
Moreover, the perceived nutritional 
benefits of consuming dairy, like 
fulfilling our daily recommendations 
for phosphorus, calcium and protein 
intake can be satisfied through 
increasing our intake of certain 
green vegetables. According to a 
2020 nutrition review published 
by scholars at Oxford Academic, 
“focusing on more nutrient-dense, 
plant-based foods would allow 
greater latitude in food choices 
to meet mineral requirements by 
allowing a greater number of choices 
from a variety of plant foods while 
reducing 
kilocalories 
consumed 

(from dairy products).”

This brings us to the ultimate 

question of why our government 
pushes pro-dairy rhetoric to the 
American public despite its obvious 
lack of merit. As it turns out, this 
entire system was constructed 
during the first World War, when 
the U.S. government began sending 
milk products overseas to nourish 
impoverished European soldiers. 
This created a booming market for 
newly specialized dairy farmers 
who invested heavily in raising dairy 
cattle. When the war ended, dairy 
farmers ended up with a plenitude 
of milk products and little demand, 
leading the U.S. government to 
sponsor 
milk 
campaigns 
that 

encouraged consumers to buy dairy 

products. This, lined up with the 
creation of the National School 
Lunch Program, which required 
public schools to serve milk as a part 
of complete meals for students. 

After Reagan cut U.S. spending, 

which included buying excess dairy 
products, Big Dairy discovered its 
ability to exert market influence 
through lobbying efforts in Congress, 
which incentivized congresspeople 
to continue including dairy in 
national 
health 
organization 

guidelines. These lobbied members 
of Congress also assist Big Dairy 
by involving dairy corporations in 
partnerships with restaurant chains, 
like Domino’s and Starbucks, where 
they can help to create dairy-heavy 
menu items for consumer use. 
The dairy industry — made up of 
companies such as Land O’Lakes and 
Dairy Farmers of America — spent a 
total of $6.7 million on lobbying in 
2021 alone. Essentially, in order to 
serve the personal interests of some 
of our government officials, pockets 
get fuller with Big Dairy money for 
the sake of their personal interest 
and they sacrifice the health of their 
nation.

There are numerous concrete 

actions that people can take to 
combat the corruption of our 
government’s 
department 
of 

agriculture. While veganism and 
vegetarianism can be far-fetched 
goals, a simple reduction of dairy 

use on a day-to-day basis can help to 
sizably decrease the dairy industry’s 
impact on our country’s people, 
animals and environment. Dairy 
alternatives, such as oat milk and soy 
milk, are just as delicious and far less 
saturated with unhealthy fats and 
excessive calories than traditional 
dairy. Oat milk pairs harmoniously 
with cereal, coffee and even baked 
goods — I personally recommend 
Chobani Vanilla Oat Milk for a 
dulcet, thick milk alternative, and 
Planet Oat Original Oat Milk for a 
light, mellow milk alternative. 

Shopping local for dairy products 

is another great alternative to 
buying from Big Dairy corporations 
because 
it 
supports 
small 

businesses, bypasses the excessive 
processing of dairy products and 
allows the consumer to know 
where their dairy is coming from. 
On a political level, it is crucial to 
support policies that take a stand 
against special interest lobbying in 
Congress and that fight to expand 
lobbying disclosure so that our 
constituency can be informed about 
what representatives are selling 
themselves to corporations. 

It is time that the American public 

stop COWering at the investment 
into healthier dairy alternatives, 
for the sake of our public health, 
environment and trust within our 
democratic system. 

A

s the fate of Ukraine teeters 
on the brink, President 
Biden has been tasked with 

a grave decision that has tremendous 
international consequences: cave 
into Russia’s demands or threaten 
to fight to defend Ukraine. The 
first option would preclude Russia 
from any attack, destroying their 
diplomatic 
reputation 
if 
they 

advanced their troops. The second, 
though it heightens the risk of a 
confrontation between the United 
States and Russia, two nuclear-
armed nations, would likely scare 
President Vladimir Putin away 
from invading in the near future. 
This would ultimately show that the 
United States means business when 
it comes to defending freedom. 

Unfortunately, Biden has chosen 

a third, murkier option that neither 
ends the conflict nor stands up to 
Russia. By continuing to support 
diplomatic channels with Russia 
while explicitly stating that his 
administration would never agree 
to Putin’s demands or send troops 
into Ukraine, Biden has made the 
United States look geopolitically 
weak, a nation uncommitted to its 
allies and unable to foster productive 
diplomatic discussions. Though it 
still remains unclear when Russia 
will choose to attack, Biden’s choices 
have permanently diminished the 
United States’s negotiating power and 
might prove catastrophic when Putin 
inevitably forwards his expansionist 
agenda.

Though Putin has been angling 

for a mainland invasion of Ukraine 
since his 2014 takeover of Crimea, 
the current conflict was instigated 
when he demanded that Ukraine be 
prohibited from ever joining NATO. 

While a drastic demand, the request is 
understandable and could even serve 
to reduce future provocations. Having 
NATO on Russia’s doorstep would be 
tantamount to having Russian troops 
permanently stationed across the 
Ambassador Bridge. Realistically, it 
would serve neither the interest of 
the U.S. nor Russia to have Ukraine 
join NATO, as it would dramatically 
increase the tension of an otherwise 
relatively stable relationship.

Beyond 
international 
security 

implications, Ukraine is unlikely to 
even be a strong fit for the NATO 
alliance. With a sizable sect of the 
population supporting the Russian 
separatist movement, Ukrainians 
would likely be wary of taking actions 
against Russia. The ongoing conflict 
in the Donbas region, which has 
been decimated by trench warfare 
between over 75,000 separatists 
and government forces since 2014, 
is evidence of just how unstable 
Ukraine’s national security was even 
before the recent spike in tensions. 
Attaching NATO backing to a region 
with tremendous turmoil could lead 
to the unnecessary involvement of 
Western troops in civil warfare and 
bloody internal conflicts. 

While meeting Putin’s demands of 

curbing NATO’s eastward expansion 
would temporarily weaken our 
standing, in the long-run, it could 
serve to ease international tensions 
and increase our goodwill amongst 
European nations currently reluctant 
to sever their economic ties with 
Russia or risk sending in troops to an 
unstable region.

The other path that Biden could 

have taken was to hang the threat of 
war or harsh sanctions over Putin to 
deter him from engaging. Though 
Biden has threatened sanctions if 
Putin were to attack, the prospect 
of future sanctions might do little to 
dissuade a Russian administration 

that has erred on the side of 
recklessness with regards to long-
term threats. If Biden had instead 
preemptively imposed sanctions on 
the Russians, he could have forced 
Putin back to the negotiating table on 
American terms and coaxed Russia 
into pulling its troops back from the 
border.

Another misstep came in Biden’s 

declaration that the U.S. would not 
engage militarily in Ukraine. Though 
the nation would clearly never send 
in American troops, the past century 
of U.S. foreign policy has shown our 
willingness to support proxy wars, 
with the U.S. training and backing 
forces throughout the Middle East 
and Africa. With three decades of 
built-up tension between the U.S. and 
Russia since the collapse of the Soviet 
Union, Putin would be wise not to 
risk any military action. By giving 
up this option, Biden has made clear 
that while the U.S. opposes Russia’s 
actions, it would never go to war 
with them, tacitly approving Putin’s 
decision to move forward with little 
U.S. military opposition.

Unfortunately, Biden is likely too 

late to fully avert a Ukrainian crisis. 
Whether Russia attacks now or waits 
until a later date, Putin is clearly set 
on expanding Russian influence 
in the region. While diplomacy is a 
viable negotiating tactic with other 
nations, as an ex-KGB officer, Putin 
seems far more likely to respect 
threats of force. With China rising 
as a global power, the U.S. can’t 
afford to stay distracted by Russia, 
so going forward, Biden would be 
wise to negotiate from a position of 
power to ensure that Russia doesn’t 
pose a future threat. If he is serious 
about 
reestablishing 
America’s 

commitment to its allies, it’s time for 
Biden to stop reacting to Putin and 
start proactively asserting American 
interests.

Junior outfielder Clark Elliott 

stared down Texas Tech pitcher 
Andrew Morris with an 0-1 count. 
His eyes locked onto the second 
pitch of the season and didn’t leave 
the ball until it reached the right 
field stands. The solo home run 
gave the Michigan baseball team 
an early 1-0 lead against the Red 
Raiders and led off an explosive 
but inconsistent offensive perfor-
mance on the weekend from the 
Wolverines.

Michigan (1-2) won just one of 

three games in the College Baseball 
showdown in Arlington, Texas, 
beating Kansas State (0-3), 10-2, 
and falling to No. 14 Texas Tech 
(1-2), 7-6, and Oklahoma (2-1), 6-1 in 
its opening weekend of the season.

The Wolverines cruised from 

the start against the Red Raid-
ers, continuing a rally through the 
second inning. Grad transfers Joe 
Stewart and Alex Fedje-Johnson 

found themselves in scoring posi-
tion after a walk and hit by pitch. 
After an RBI single by senior 
infielder Riley Bertram, Elliott 
found himself in the spotlight 
again with two runners on base.

He capitalized, barrelling his 

second hit of the night into right 
field to score both runners. Elliott 
was the Wolverines’ clear best hit-
ter on the weekend raking in two 
home runs, four RBIs and a .462 
batting average. 

“He’s one of the harder workers 

we’ve had and a guy that got a lot 
of confidence this summer com-
peting against the best out in the 
Cape Cod League and carried that 
confidence into this season so far,” 
Michigan coach Eric Bakich said. 
“ … He’s just very steady and just 
does a really good job staying cen-
tered mentally and with his routine 
putting together a lot of consisten-
cy in his preparation.”

The bats cooled off after the 

fiery start until two outs in the fifth 
inning. The Wolverines rattled off 
three straight singles, with senior 

infielder Jack Van Remortel hit-
ting Stewart to his second run of 
the night.

No runs were scored from the 

seventh inning on and the game fell 
on the shoulders of senior reliever 
Willie Weiss in the bottom of the 
ninth. He allowed the first three 
batters to reach base and sopho-
more outfielder Dalton Porter hit a 
sac fly to tie the game at six.

Texas Tech outfielder Owen 

Washburn stepped up to the plate 
for the biggest at bat of his career 
thus far. In his first ever college 
game, Washburn laced a walk-off 
single to right field, scoring senior 
infielder Cole Stilwell for the Red 
Raiders’ 7-6 win.

“I wouldn’t look back at that 

game and say ‘man, Texas Tech 
beat us,’ ” Bakich said. “I would 
look back at that game and say we 
lost that game. We had the lead. 
They did stop us from continuing 
to score, but we gave that one away 
with just the extra 90s and the 
freebies. You can’t do that.”

Saturday’s game against Kan-

sas State started off cold for both 
teams. The bullpens clamped 
down until the sixth inning when 
the Wildcats switched pitchers 
to sophomore Griffin Hassal who 
struggled to find the plate.

Junior catcher Jimmy Obertop 

advanced from first to third after 
two consecutive wild pitches. 
Michigan continued to pile on 
after a lucky error at first with two 
outs. Van Remortal batted in Fedje-
Johnson with a double and would 
later score off another Kansas State 
error to make it a 3-1 game.

The Wildcats tried to slow the 

Wolverines down with another 
pitching change at the top of the 
seventh, but it only made things 
worse. Michigan went off for a sea-
son-high seven runs in an inning 
capped off by Elliott’s second home 
run of the weekend to ice the game 
at 10-2.

The Wolverines again started 

cold against Oklahoma but had 
ample chances starting in the fourth 
inning. Junior infielder Ted Burton 
reached first via an error and was 

hit home by a double from Obertop.

The fifth inning looked like a 

return to the cold bats with two 
consecutive outs to start, but Ber-
tram and Elliott rattled off two 
singles to put men at first and third, 
giving Burton a chance to capitalize.

The Sooners made a pitch-

ing change and struck him out to 
halt Michigan’s momentum. The 
Wolverines didn’t put a runner in 
scoring position for the rest of the 
game. Oklahoma cleaned up in the 
eighth to secure a 6-1 victory over 
Michigan.

“The difference was that Kansas 

State made the mistakes against us 
that we made against Oklahoma 
tonight in terms of walks, errors, 
and extra 90s,” Bakich said. “When 
you give things away to good 
teams, they make you pay for it.”

Michigan is not unfamiliar 

with rough starts to the season. It 
schedules many of the best non-
conference opponents for open-
ing weekend to highlight its own 
weaknesses early. 

“It’s good for us to get knocked 

down a little bit and face a little 
adversity early this year,” Bakich 
said. “That’s why we scheduled 
the teams that we scheduled. … We 
expect that there’s going to be some 
getting knocked down where we’re 
going to have a response. We’ll cer-
tainly use that to our advantage 
and it helped us in the past, cer-
tainly helped us in 2019.”

Michigan has suspended coach 

Juwan Howard for the remainder 
of the regular season, Yahoo Sports 
first reported Monday evening.

Howard will miss the Wolver-

ines’ five remaining regular sea-
son games as the team attempts to 
secure an NCAA Tournament bid 
and play its way off the bubble. In 
his absence, associate head coach 
Phil Martelli will serve as Michi-
gan’s acting head coach, while 
director of basketball operations 
Chris Hunter will temporary fulfill 
the third assistant coaching posi-
tion.

The suspension follows Sun-

day’s incident in which Howard 
took a swipe at a Wisconsin assis-
tant coach in the postgame hand-
shake line, inciting a full-out brawl 
between the two sides.

Howard will also be fined 

$40,000.

“After taking time to reflect on 

all that happened, I realize how 
unacceptable both my actions and 
words were, and how they affected 
so many,” Howard said in a state-
ment released Monday evening. “I 
am truly sorry. I am offering my 
sincerest apology to my players and 

their families, my staff, my family 
and the Michigan fans around the 
world. I would like to personally 
apologize to Wisconsin’s Assistant 
Coach Joe Krabbenhoft and his 
family, too.

“Lastly, I speak a lot about being 

a Michigan man and representing 
the University of Michigan with 
class and pride, I did not do that, 
nor did I set the right example in 
the right way for my student-ath-
letes. I will learn from my mistake 
and this mistake will never happen 
again. No excuses!”

After Sunday’s transgression, 

Michigan athletic director Warde 
Manuel released the following 
statement:

“I am aware of and watched the 

end of our men’s basketball game. 
There is no excuse for any of our 
staff or student-athletes to get into 
a physical altercation with oth-
ers regardless of instigating fac-
tors. I reached out and apologized 
to Chris McIntosh and President 
Coleman has reached out to UQ 
Chancellor Blank to apologize for 
the totally unacceptable behavior. 
We will review the situation more 
thoroughly and work with the Big 
Ten Conference as they determine 
their disciplinary actions and will 
determine if any further disciplin-
ary actions are needed.”

In his press conference after 

the game, Howard did not issue an 
apology, instead doubling down on 
his sentiment.

“I addressed it with (Gard) that 

I will remember that because of 
that timeout,” Howard said. “For 
someone to touch me, I think that 
was very uncalled for him to touch 
me, as we were verbalizing and 
communicating with one another. 
So that’s what ended up happening. 
And that’s what escalated it.”

While Big Ten rules state that 

disciplinary fines will “not exceed 
$10,000” and suspensions for “no 
more than two contests,” Michigan 
worked alongside the Big Ten to 
amplify the punishment, extend-
ing the length of the suspension.

In addition to Howard, two Wol-

verines will be suspended one game 
each: Freshman forward Moussa 
Diabate and sophomore forward 
Terrance Williams II, who both 
appeared to throw punches during 
Sunday’s brawl. The suspensions 
are effective immediately, mean-
ing Diabate and Williams will miss 
Wednesday’s contest against Rut-
gers.

On the Wisconsin side of things, 

guard Jahcobi Neath will receive 
a one-game suspension, while 
coach Greg Gard will be fined 
$10k. Meanwhile, assistant coach 
Joe Krabbenhoft, who was also 
involved in the altercation, will not 

receive any sort of punishment.

“Big Ten Conference coaches 

and student-athletes are expect-
ed to display the highest level 
of sportsmanship conduct,” Big 
Ten commissioner Kevin War-
ren released in a statement. “I 
am grateful for the partnership 
with Michigan Athletics Direc-
tor, Warde Manuel and Wisconsin 
Athletics Director, Chris McIn-
tosh. Our expectation is that the 
incident yesterday will provide our 
coaches and student-athletes with 
the opportunity to reflect, learn 
and move forward in a manner that 
demonstrates decorum and leader-
ship on and off of the court.”

The No. 9 Michigan women’s bas-

ketball team had been here before in 
Ann Arbor. 

Fighting once again for control of 

the Big Ten in their matchup with 
Maryland, the Wolverines found 
themselves in a familiar place. Less 
than a month ago, Michigan faced 
off with Indiana under the same cir-
cumstances.

The biggest difference between 

the two? Senior wing Leigha Brown’s 
absence.

Against the Hoosiers, Brown 

was tied for second-leading scor-
er. Without her, the Wolverines 
have struggled to make up for 
her 14.8 points per game average, 
falling in consecutive outings to 
Michigan State and Northwest-
ern. 

But in Michigan’s 71-59 victory 

over the Terrapins on Sunday, the 
Wolverines finally found the sec-
ondary scoring they had lacked in 
their previous two contests. Spe-
cifically, the team’s guards made 
up for Brown’s lost production. 

“We’re really tough to guard 

when everyone’s being aggres-
sive,” junior guard Maddie Nolan 
said. “(There were) shots in the 
second half where they started 
double teaming Naz so we were 
able to find Laila (Phelia) and me 
and Danielle (Rauch).”

Much like in the matchup 

against Indiana, Hillmon mostly 
carried Michigan’s offense early 
on. Without any offensive pres-
ence outside the post, the Ter-
rapins were able to sag off their 
defenders and condense into the 
paint against Hillmon throughout 
the first half. Heading into half-
time Michigan knew they’d have 
to recalibrate.

Struggling to score for nearly 

three minutes into the second 
half, the Wolverines needed a 
spark. Phelia — a freshman guard 
— was the first to light up, finding 
her way into the lane for a driv-
ing layup. On the next play, Phelia 
drained a 3-pointer at the tail end 

of the shot clock.

“When we’re having an inside-

outside attack, we’re at our best,” 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico said. “And there’s always so 
much pressure on Naz, a double-
team, a triple-team … so we were 
just really encouraging them at 
halftime to shoot the ball and to 
be aggressive from that guard 
spot as well.”

Nolan kept the streak alive 

throughout the fourth quarter, 
scoring eight of her eleven points 
in the final frame. Going 3-for-5 
from the 3-point line and grab-
bing five rebounds, Nolan made 
herself indispensable down the 
stretch.

With the win-by-committee 

style the Wolverines found for the 
first time since Brown’s absence, 
Rauch — a senior guard — also 
found her stride late in the game. 
The second leading scorer against 
both the Spartans and the Wild-
cats, Rauch has filed nicely into 
the missing gaps left behind by 
Brown.

Sophomore guard Elise Stuck 

also brought depth off the bench 
notching four points and one 
assist in just three minutes. 

Attacking the Terrapins’ lim-

ited bench which had only eight 
dressed players, the Wolverines 
tired them out with multiple dif-
ferent looks and offensive sets.

“They were able to kind of send 

more waves in against us,” Mary-
land coach Brenda Frese said. 
“And they had more depth.”

The losses to Michigan State 

and Northwestern highlighted 
many problems, but one was glar-
ingly obvious: Simply relying on 
Hillmon is no longer enough for 
the Wolverines. Other teams key 
in on the paint and focus their 
entire defense on stopping her. 
When Michigan’s guards are 
producing offensively, it disrupts 
opposing teams’ game plan.

With control of the Big Ten 

on the line, Michigan needed its 
role players to step up. And after 
multiple missteps in their last two 
losses, against Maryland, they 
finally did.

Michigan loses to Wisconsin with grim 
second half performance, ugly scrum

An ugly performance for the 

Michigan men’s basketball team 
turned uglier after the final buzzer 
sounded Sunday afternoon. 

After Michigan (14-11 overall, 

8-7 Big Ten) fell to No. 15 Wiscon-
sin (21-5, 12-4), 77-63, the postgame 
handshake line morphed into a 
physical altercation. Several Wol-
verines engaged in the scuffle and 
Michigan coach Juwan Howard 
threw a punch at a Wisconsin assis-
tant coach. 

After the game Howard seemed 

prepared to suffer the consequences 
of his actions, although he did not 
utter an apology:

“I respect whatever the Big Ten 

decision that they make,” Howard 
said. “It’s up to them and I will 
respect whatever decision they 
end up making.”

Frustrations boiled over for 

Howard, perturbed that Wiscon-
sin coach Greg Gard took a time-
out with 15 seconds left in a game 
that was a foregone conclusion. 
But the punches also came after 
a lamentable second half perfor-
mance for the Wolverines, who 

saw a tied game at halftime turn 
into a blowout loss. 

The first half played out as a 

tug-of-war, with neither team able 
to drag itself towards a win. Play-
ing at a snail’s pace, both teams 
grinded through possessions, not 
finding many open buckets or 
chances to run in transition. The 
teams combined for just one three 
pointer, further adding to the ugly 
offensive pace. 

Instead, the main battle trans-

pired in the paint. The Wolver-
ines leaned on sophomore center 
Hunter Dickinson, who scored 15 
of their 31 first half points. The 
Badgers refused to commit to 
double teams and Dickinson took 
advantage, constantly flipping 
hook shots toward the rim. But, 
Wisconsin challenged Michigan’s 
interior defense with similar suc-
cess, equalling the Wolverines’ 31 
points with 22 coming inside the 
paint.

Neither team could find any 

separation at the halfway point.

Michigan appeared to break 

the seal on its rim to start the 
second half, as it raced out to 7-0 
run and went up 38-33. Instead, 
the quick offensive spurt proved 
to be a mirage. Empty offensive 
possessions piled up — including 
a plethora of missed threes — and 
an instant lead in the second half 
turned into a growing deficit. 

“I think a lot of our shots were 

good 
shots,” 
Dickinson 
said. 

“They just happened not to go 
in. But when you stop shooting, 
that shows a lack of confidence 
in yourself. And that’s the worst 
thing that can happen in basket-
ball is when you don’t have confi-
dence in yourself.”

Suddenly trailing with less 

than twelve minutes to go, the 
offense looked to break out from 
its slog and prevent the game 
from completely unraveling. But 
there was no solace on that end of 
the floor. Offensive fouls, blocked 
shots and 3-point attempts clang-
ing off the rim ultimately spelled 
doom for the Wolverines. A 38-33 
lead had turned into an astonish-
ing 56-41 deficit. 

“We just had some mental laps-

es on defense,” graduate trans-
fer guard DeVante’ Jones said. 
“I think that was a big thing for 
us. And (Badgers’ guard) Johnny 
Davis hit some tough shots and 
they just kind of fed off that.”

The Wolverines had no answer 

for Davis, who amassed 23 points 
on 11-for-16 shooting. The offense 
completely disappeared, espe-
cially Dickinson, who scored just 
six points in the final 20 minutes 
after his scorching start. Michi-
gan as a team shot an atrocious 
4-for-25 from beyond the arc and 
was never able to cut into the lead 
once it fell behind — trailing by 
double digits for a majority of the 
second half.

An abysmal second half show-

ing caused a game within reach 
for the Wolverines to completely 
slip away. The forgettable result, 
though, didn’t kill Michigan’s 
postseason hopes. 

But the actions that followed 

postgame will long be remem-
bered. The fight creates a number 
of problems — and almost cer-
tainly some suspensions — that 
will make what’s been a difficult 
season for the Wolverines that 
much harder to navigate as the 
finish line nears.

H

eading 
into 
Sunday’s 

game at No. 15 Wisconsin, 
the questions surrounding 

the Michigan men’s basketball team 
were solely on the court.

Would the Wolverines be able 

to pick up a second consecutive 
Quadrant 1 road win and put 
themselves safely on the right side of 
the NCAA Tournament bubble? Or 
would they once again follow up an 
important win with a dud?

But as Michigan left the Kohl 

Center floor after a blowout loss, all 
of those points became moot. All that 
mattered was the altercation between 
Michigan coach Juwan Howard and 
Wisconsin coach Greg Gard in the 
handshake line, an ugly incident that 
resulted in Howard throwing a punch 
at Badgers’ assistant Joe Krabbenhoft 
and a full-team brawl.

Any way you look at it, Howard’s 

actions were inexcusable. His 
failure to apologize postgame 
or 
even 
acknowledge 
any 

wrongdoing only made matters 
worse. Michigan athletic director 
Warde Manuel admitted that 
much in a statement after the 
game.

According to both coaches, 

the incident stemmed from a 
sequence that occurred with just 
15 seconds remaining in the game. 
While Wisconsin had a lineup of 
all reserves on the court, Howard 
left a few of his starters in the 
game and instructed them to play 
a full-court press. In danger of a 
backcourt violation, Gard called 
a timeout to reset the 10-second 
clock and draw up a play to break 
the press.

“I didn’t like the timeout being 

called,” Howard said afterwards. 
“I’ll be totally honest with you, I 
thought it was not necessary at 
that moment, especially being 
a large lead, and then for the 
time out to be called with three 
seconds or four seconds to go. I 
thought that … wasn’t fair to our 
guys.”

Howard said extending the 

game wasn’t fair to his players, 
but he should have considered 
how unfair of a position his 
response has now put them in. By 
throwing a punch, Howard will 
almost certainly be suspended for 
the foreseeable future, missing 
a string of crucial games for 
his team’s NCAA Tournament 
push. All five of the Wolverines’ 
remaining games are against 
potential tournament teams, and 
they likely need to win three to 
feel good about their chances 
entering the Big Ten Tournament.

Now, they might be without 

their head coach for all of 
them. And the ramifications of 
Howard’s actions might make 
things worse.

After Howard escalated the 

situation, multiple players on 
both sides got involved. Freshman 
forward Moussa Diabate and 
sophomore 
forward 
Terrance 

Williams II also appeared to 
throw punches, which could 
result in additional suspensions.

Needless to say, losing Diabate 

— who dropped a career-high 
28 points just two games ago 
— and Williams, a key cog in 
an undermanned rotation, will 
hamper Michigan’s ability to 
rattle off much-needed victories. 

When asked after the game why 

players stepped in, sophomore 
center Hunter Dickinson and 
graduate guard DeVante’ Jones 

both preached a “we’re a family” 
mantra. Howard even used that 
to essentially excuse his players’ 
actions, saying:

“But you know what? I respect 

our young men for saying what 
they’re saying as far as we are a 
family and truly, but did not want 
it to be in a situation where it 
escalated like that.”

If Howard truly believes that 

this team is a family, and if he 
truly didn’t want to escalate 
anything, he should have had 
the wherewithal to temper his 
emotions to avoid what would 
transpire.

Players play with a lot of 

adrenaline, and after a tough loss, 
they tend to run hot. It’s already 
happened to Diabate this season 
when he got into a skirmish after 
a loss to Rutgers.

But Sunday, Howard put all 

of his players in a situation to 
potentially face discipline. And 
even the ones that are allowed to 
play on Wednesday against the 
Scarlet Knights will be forced to 
do so shorthanded and without 
their coach. Howard put his 
entire team — a team that has 
finally begun to rack up big wins 
and seemed poised to secure an 
NCAA Tournament bid after 
months of frustration — in an 
unfair spot, both directly after 
the game and as the season comes 
to a close.

For Michigan, Sunday should 

have been a mere blip on the radar, 
a chance to address shortcomings 
after a loss and regroup for a 
crucial stretch run.

Instead, Sunday’s ramifications 

will last as long as Michigan’s 
season does.

And Howard’s actions may 

have shortened it.
