Young adults
with health
coverage up
by 900,000

Engineering junior Christopher Fair flies a kite at the New Millenium Kite Festival, which was sponsored by the University's Center for Chinese Studies and the Con-

Gov't officials,
'U' professors
attribute increase
to health care law
By ANDREW SCHULMAN
Daily StaffReporter
The number of young
adults with health insurance
increased by almost a million in
the past year.
Approximately 900,000
people under age 26 became
insured between January 2010
and March 2011, according to
data released last week by the
Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention. The increase,
which outpaced last year's
U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services projections,
lowered the rate of uninsured
18-to-25 year olds from 28 per-
centinthethird quarter of2010
to 24.2 percent in the second
quarter of 2011.
Last week, members of the
Obama administration attrib-
uted the increase to a provision

in the Affordable Care Act that
allows young adults to remain
on their families' insurance
policies as dependantsuntil age
26 This provision went into
effect on Sept.23, 2010.
While the suggestion that
the Affordable Care Act direct-
ly caused the rise in the number
of insured young adults has not
been proven, Kathleen Sebe-
lius, secretary of the Depart-
ment of Health and Human
Services, said the U.S. Census
Bureau's data is evidence that
the legislation is working.
"The Affordable Care Act
has made the health care sys-
tem better for millions of
Americans," Sebelius said.
"This law is helping to give
hardworking families the
security they deserve and stop
insurance company abuses,
hold down insurance premi-
ums and strengthen Medicare."
University professors point-
ed to the reduced number of
uninsured Americans in all
other age groups and the cor-
responding time of the enact-
ment of the health care law as

UMHS deal to save
county $1.5 million
in three years
By CLAIRE HALL
Daily StaffReporter
Due to a shortage of patholo-
gists in Detroit, the University
has stepped in to help balance

Wayne County morgue's bur-
geoning caseload.
The University of Michigan
Health System and the Wayne
County Medical Examiner's
Office finalized a three-year
partnership recently making
WCMEO's forensic patholo-
gists - the doctors who conduct
autopsies - employees of the
University.
Wayne County, which has

suffered budget cuts in recent
years, required more patholo-
gists to conduct about 2,500
autopsies that come through
the morgue annually, according
to WCMEO spokesman Dennis
Niemiec.,The WCMEO current-
ly has five forensic pathologists,
but the office needs a total of
eight doctors, according to Nie-
miec.
"It was becoming difficult to

recruit them because nationally
there's a shortage of forensic
pathologists," he said.
However, UMHS can assist
in the recruitment trdcess. The
University has the ability to
draw top-level candidates with
name recognition and higher
salaries, Niemiec sal. He added
that the University can pay
pathologists up to $ 60,000 a

AATA proposes to expand services
between Ypsilanti and Ann Arbor

Transit authority
also planning new
airport shuttle
service to DTW
By ADAM RUBENFIRE
Daily StaffReporter
The Ann Arbor Transit
Authority's constituents might
find they have more efficient
travels between Ann Arbor
and Ypsilanti in upcoming
years.

AATA spokeswoman Mary
Stasiak said the transit author-
ity is responding to people's
needs by proposing to expand
its services in the next few
years. In addition to extending
some of its current services
between the two cities, AATA
is also proposing several new
services including a shuttle to
the Detroit Metro Airport.
Due to a long-time demand,
the AATA has proposed
expanding its bus service
along Washtenaw Avenue,
otherwise known as Route 4,
Stasiak said.

AATA will also be expand-
ing Night Ride, a late-night
shared taxi service that cur-
rently operates within Ann
Arbor. With the changes, the
service would expand to areas
in Ann Arbor Township and
Ypsilanti. While AATA consid-
ers its services at peak com-
muting hours to be sufficient,
the expansion of Night Ride
was prompted by residents'
varying schedules, according
to Stasiak.
"There's still a lot of people
who have different schedules

By CHELSEA LANDRY
For the Daily
Ann Arbor's 62-year-old
grocery store, White Market,
faces an uncertain future since

the building that has served
as home to the shop recently
changed hands.
Dave Jones and his wife Dar-
lene, owners of White Market
for more than 27 years, con-
firmed last week the building
has been sold. The Joneses
said they have not yet decided
if they will renew the lease for
White Market, which expires
at the end of this year.

"We're not making any plans
beyond that," Dave Jones said.
He added that he met with
the new building owner last
week but still has not reached
a decision regarding his busi-
ness's future.
"A lot depends upon what
the new landlord says," Jones
said.

KALAMAZOO, Mich.
Man surrenders
after opening fire
in apartment
Police in Kalamazoo say a
22-year-old man surrendered
soon after shooting a 29-year-old
man to death in the hallway of an
apartment building.
The Department of Public
Safety says the killing happened
about 10:40 p.m. Saturday at the
Fox Ridge Apartment Complex.
They say police officers found
the victim lying in a second-floor
hallway.
He lived in the apartments.
So far, police haven't released
the names of the victim or the
suspect, who's also a Kalamazoo
resident. He's in the Kalamazoo
County Jail on an open murder
charge.

Once considered
extinct, rare breed
of ferret rebounds
The only ferret species native
to North America is well on its
way to recovery since biologists
concluded the creatures went
extinct in 1979.
Thirty years ago this month,
a ranch dog named Shep killed a
black-footed ferret near Meetee-
tse (me-TEET'-see) in northwest
Wyoming.
Shep's owner found the dead
ferret. Word got out and it didn't
take long for biologists to find
about 100 black-footed ferrets
living on a nearby ranch.
A federal captive breeding
program has helped to re-estab-
lish about 1,000 black-footed
ferrets in eight Western states,
Canada and Mexico.

NY Senator
accuses OnStar of
inv di igprivacy
The OnStar automobile com-
munication service used by 6
million Americans maintains
its two-way connection with a
customer even after the service
is discontinued, while reserving
the right to sell data from that
connection.
U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer of
New York says that's a blatant
invasion of privacy and is calling
on the Federal Trade Commis-
sion to investigate. But OnStar
says former customers can stop
the two-way transmission, and
ni> driving data of customers has
been shared or sold.
"OnStar is attempting one
of the most brazen invasions
of privacy in recent memory,"
said Schumer, a Democrat. "I
urge OnStar to abandon this
policy."
But the General Motors Corp.
OnStar service says customers
are thoroughly informed of the
new practice. If a customer says

he or she doesn't want to have
data collected after service is
ended, OnStar disconnects the
tracking.

The march took place in the
sprawling lower income neigh-

pro-democracy demonstrators
were attacked and beaten by
police.
"Once we were beaten here,
now we have returned," chanted
the exultant marchers, who were
calling for greater freedoms and
an end to government corrup-

Saudi women
can run, vote in
2015 election

President Barack Obama greets supporters after speaking at a Democratic fundraiser at the Paramount Theater in
Seattle, Wash., on Sunday, Sept. 25.
Pres. says GOP vision
would cripple' nation

With next election
Thursday, women
not satisfied
RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP)
- Saudi Arabia's King Abdul-
lah, considered a reformer by the
standards of his own ultracon-
servative kingdom, decreed yes-
terday that women will for the
first time have the right to vote
and run in local elections due in
2015.
It is a "Saudi Spring" of sorts.
For the nation's women, it is a
giant leap forward, though they
remain unable to serve as Cabi-
net ministers, drive or travel
abroad without permission from
a male guardian.
Saudi women bear the brunt
of their nation's deeply conserva-
tive values, often finding them-
selves the target of the unwanted
attention of the kingdom's intru-
sive religious police, who enforce
a rigid interpretation of Islamic
Shariah law on the streets and
public places like shopping malls
and university campuses.
In itself, yesterday's decision
to give the women the right to
vote and run in municipal elec-
tions may not be enough to sat-
isfy the growing ambition of the
kingdom's women who, after
years of lavish state spending on
education and vocational train-
ing, significantly improved their
standing but could not secure the
same place in society as that of
their male compatriots.
That women must wait four
more years to exercise their
newly acquired right to vote adds
insult to injury since yesterday's
announcement was already a
long time coming - and the next

local elections are in fact sched-
uled for this Thursday.
"Why not tomorrow?" asked
prominent Saudi feminist Waje-
ha al-Hawaidar. "Ithink theking
doesn't want to shake the coun-
try, but we look around us and
we think it is a shame ... when we
are still pondering how to meet
simple women's rights."
The announcement by King
Abdullah came in an annual
speech before his advisory
assembly, or Shura Council. It
was made after he consulted
wiih the nation's top religious
clerics, whose advice carries
great weight in the kingdom.
It is an attempt at "Saudi
style" reform, moves that avoid
antagonizing the powerful cler-
gy and a conservative segment
of the population. Additionally,
it seems to be part of the king's
drive to insulate his vast, oil-
rich country from the upheavals
sweeping other Arab nations,
with popular uprisings toppling
regimes that once looked as
secure as his own.
Fearing unrest at home, the
king in March announced a stag-
gering $93 billion package of
incentives, jobs and services to
ease the hardships experienced
by some Saudis. In the mean-
time, he sent troops to neighbor
and close ally Bahrain to help the
tiny nation's Sunni ruling fam-
ily crush an uprising by majority
Shiites pressing for equal rights
and far-reaching reforms.
In contrast, King Abdullah
in August withdrew the Saudi
ambassador from Syriato protest
President Bashar Assad's brutal
crackdown on a seven-month
uprising that calls for his ouster
and the establishment of a demo-
cratic government.

Obama attempts
to re-engage with
liberal supporters
on West Coast
SEATTLE (AP) - Presi-
dent Barack Obama charged
yesterday that the GOP vision
of government would "funda-
mentally cripple America," as
he tried out his newly combat-
ive message on the liberal West
Coast.
Aiming to renew the ardor
of Democratic loyalists who
have grown increasingly dis-
enchanted with him, the presi-
dent mixed frontal attacks on
Republicans with words of
encouragement intended to
buck up the faithful as the 2012
campaign revs up.
"From the moment I took
office what we've seen is a con-
stant ideological pushback
against any kind of sensible
reforms that would make our
economy work better and give
people more opportunity,"
the president said at an inti-

mate brunch fundraiser at the
Medina, Wash., home of former
Microsoft executive Jon Shirley.
About 65 guests were paying
$35,800 per couple to listen to
Obama at the first of seven fun-
draisers he was holding from
Seattle to Hollywood to San
Diego yesterday and today. The
three-day West Coast swing,
ending tomorrow in Denver,
offered him the chance to re-
engage with some of his most
liberal and deep-pocketed sup-
porters.
The trip comes as Obama
has shifted from focusing on
compromise with Republi-
cans on Capitol Hill to call-
ing out House Speaker John
Boehner and others by name.
The president has criticized
them as obstructionists while
demanding their help in pass-
ing his $447 billion jobs bill.
The revamped approach
is a relief to Democratic
activists fed up by what they
viewed as the president's
ceding of ground to the GOP
on tax cuts and other issues
while the economy has
stalled and unemployment is

stuck above 9 percent.
Obama said 2012 would be
an especially tough election
because people are discour-
aged and disillusioned with
government, but he also said
he was determined because so
much is at stake.
The GOP alternative, Obama
said, is "an approach to govern-
ment that will fundamentally
cripple America in meeting the
challenges of the 21st century.
And that's not the kind of soci-
ety that I want to leave to Malia
and Sasha."
Obama got a friendly wel-
come from invited guests at
his first stop. But later, liberal
activists greeted the president
with a demonstration.

Series of bombings
kill 10 injIraq city

Iraqi Prime
Minister calls
bombings a
'heinous crime'
BAGHDAD (AP) - Back-
to-back bomb blasts ripped
through one of the holiest cities
in Shiite Islam yesterday, killing
at least 10 people in a commu-
nity still reeling from a deadly
bus hijacking earlier this month
that left Iraq's Shiites again
feeling hunted.
Four explosions struck the
city of Karbala over a five-min-
ute period, government officials
said, sending thick black smoke
over the city. Two of the bombs
targeted an Interior Minis-
try office that issues ID cards.
Another struck near a house,
shredding its walls and ceiling.
And one of the explosions went
off half a mile from an impor-
tant gold-domed shrine.
"Once again, the terror-
ist enemies of both Iraq and
humanity have committed a
new crime against the innocent
people of Karbala," said Prime
Minister Nouri al-Maliki, a Shi-
ite.
He called the bombings a
"heinous crime," and promised
those behind them and the ear-
lier attack on the bus would be
punished. He also warned peo-
ple not to be drawn back into
sectarian revenge killings.
"We should stay united and
cease statements or acts that
would help the criminals in
their efforts to ignite sedition,"
al-Maliki said.
Ferocious bombing attacks
bySunii"insurgent groups like

al-Qaida in Iraq targeted
the Shiite community whose
leaders came to power after
the fall of Saddam Hussein.
The bloodshed pushed the
nation to the edge of civil war.
Violence in Iraq has fall-
en dramatically since the
bloodletting of 2006 and
2007, but militant attacks
still appear aimed at re-
igniting the nation's volatile
ethnic and religious divide.
The Sept. 12 bus attack
targeted Shiite pilgrims from
Karbala who were headed to
a shrine in neighboring Syria.
The gunmen stopped the
bus at a fake checkpoint in
the western desert of Anbar
province, heavily populated
by Sunnis and once one of
the heartlands of the insur-
gency.
The assailants pulled 22
men from the bus and shot
them execution-style, leav-
ing the women and children
weeping beside a remote
highway.
Al-Maliki has been try-
ing to tamp down tensions
between officials in Karbala
and Anbar since the high-
jacking. Four suspects are
being held in the case, and al-
Maliki's military advisers say
at least some foreigners were
among the plotters.
Yesterday's bombings in
Karbala were meant to raise
tensions further, officials
said.
"The aim of these explo-
sions is to ignite the sectar-
ian sedition after the killing
of 22 Karbala residents in the
Anbar desert two weeks ago,"
said provincial councilman
Hussein Shadhan al-Aboudi.

A fatal penalty
Capital punishment should be abolished
s the world watched the controversy over Troy Davis's exe-
cution in Georgia last week, there was much debate over the
necessity and morality of capital punishment. Davis was con-
victed of murdering an off-duty police officer in 1989, but his guilt was
seriously in question. In a justice system full of imperfections, ques-
tions and doubts, it's difficult to agree with the court's irreversible
decision. The death penalty is not a just way to punish a crime and
should be abolished in the United States.

Anonymity of sources and
writers is generally shunned
in journalism, and this sen-
timent is reflected in the bylaws
of The Michigan Daily. A debate
about this issue arose in light of the
Daily's decision to grant anonymity
to the writer of
a cover story in IMRAN
The StatementS
about fake IDs SYED
(Faking 21: How Public Editor
bouncers catch
fake IDs and
underage students get past the rope,
9/05/2011).
Readers raised concerns about
the need and wisdom of granting
anonymity to the writer in this case.
To broaden my own perspective, I
also solicited the thoughts of three
former Daily editors (who hailed
from three different sections of the
Daily). Finally, I sat down for a dis-
cussion about the story and the deci-
sions that went into it with its writer
and the two editors most respon-
sibleforit: StatementEditorCarolyn
Klarecki and Daily Editor in Chief
Stephanie Steinberg.
(Because the Daily's decision to
grant anonymity is final, this col-
umnrefers to the writer as ageneric
"he." This should not be taken as
an indication of the writer's actual
gender.)
The main concerns raised were
about the credibility a newspaper
loses by not having a name attached
to each story. Was the story so weak
or questionable that the writer can't
stand by it? Shouldn't the Daily
make all writers own up to the shots
they take? Did the Daily facilitate
illegality by protecting the name of
a writer who broke laws? And if so,
was the final product worth all that?
Having read the story closely sev-
eral times, I find it rather harmless
- in two important ways.
First, I don't believe the writer
abused the anonymity granted to
say things he otherwise wouldn't. In
fact, for the most challenging parts
of writing this story - attempting to
dupe bouncers at bars and explain-
ing his misdeeds to perturbed bar
owners and managers - the writer
actually did .1 ealt hmself. The
writer took the significant step of

exposing himself to that hostile
group to Write a story that wasclear-
ly not easy. The journalism here,
despite its other flaws, was anything
butlazy.
Second, however, I remainuncon-
vinced that the story accomplished
anything significant. In my discus-
sion with the writer and editors
responsible, they could not explain
the story's purpose or even assess
the end product on anything other
than a primary, facial level. I was
told that not everything in a college
newspaper, and certainly not every-
thing in a magazine like The State-
ment, should be an advocacy piece
that pushes an agenda.
While I agree with that senti-
ment, I must stress my disagreement
with the decision to take the sub-
stantial step of granting anonymity
to a writer for a story that apparently
wasn't even intentioned to make a
solid point.
It's undeniable that an anony-
mous story is a strain on the Daily's
credibility: It's natural for people
to be more suspicious of something
said anonymously as compared to
something with a name attached to
it. Without a writer standing by the
words that are written, the entire
weight of any flaws the story may
have falls on the Daily itself. This is
a weight the Daily willingly bears
in the case of unsigned editorials,
which are the opinion of the paper
as a whole.
But the Daily, like any institu-
tion, has only a limited supply of
credibility capital, and it should be
expended judiciously. There will be
rare occasions when a costly dip into
that reserve will be necessary. But
it's crucial to separate situations of
such necessity from the less press-
ing situations where anonymity is a
mere tool of convenience. I believe
the Statement story at issue falls into
the latter category.
When asked if the story could
have been written with a byline,
the writer and editors responsible
concluded that it could not. Cit-
ing the law-breaking the writer
engaged in, the editors stated that
including a -name-would, doom
the writer isnsmaxiofair'wyse.
Every time a prospective;employer

searched the name on the Internet,
this story would come up - and it
would be hard to explain the mer-
its of the story to an interviewer,
especially someone outside the
field of journalism.
While I sympathize with that
dilemma, I conclude that it is not a
mandatory one. The focus should be
on how to write the story in the first
place, rather than on whether to risk
a byline on the story as written.
The story could have been writ-
ten through observation and inter-
action, using all ethnographic tools
needed - short of the writer's own
participation in illegal activity - to
create authenticity. And if that were
done, there would be no need for
anonymity. While there would be
some loss of experiential proxim-
ity in this alternative approach, I
found nothing that the first-person
perspective added to this story that
would be so worth retaining.
Though the story was a diligent
exercise in journalistic legwork,
it avoided all engagement with
any of the several abstract debates
it stumbled upon. Why do bars
return fake IDs to students? Why
do bars known to be more lenient
to underage drinkers continue
to escape reprimand? And most
importantly, what do underage
drinking laws really mean in a col-
lege town where all sides concede
and generally accept that the laws
are constantly broken?
It's perfectly fine to say, as the
writer and editors did to me, that
thepurposeofsomestorieswillsim-
ply be to start a conversation - as
opposed to exposing wrongdoing or
advocating an agenda. But the ques-
tion then becomes whether such
stories that make no bold argument
warrant the protection of anonym-
ity. Given the costs such protection
involves for this paper as an institu-
tion, I believe that they do not.

The certainty of a conviction in the U.S.
legal system can almost never be guaranteed.
In any trial, there's always potential for doubt
regarding an individual's guil-,In Davis's
trial, witnesses recanted their statements,
jurors expressed doubts, a weapon was never
found and DNA evidence was not available,
but a man was still sentenced to death. The
responsibilities of higher courts and appellate
review are to verifyasentencingt.yond area-
sonable doubt and to assess the legitimacy of
a trial. However, these processes don't ensure
the correct sentencing, which is why the final-
ity of capital punishment is so troubling.
The Davis trial lacked reliable physical
evidence - mainly a murder weapon. The
case relied predominantly on eyewitness tes-
timony, which was revealed to be question-
able at best after the trial. Seven of the nine
non-police witnesses recanted their testi-
mony, and many of the witnesses said police
coerced them to implicate Davis. Confident
eyewitness testimony is becoming less trust-
worthy in legal proceedings, and this type of
evidence should be considered insufficient
'hen a court is deciding whether or not to
put a person to death. In thetLS., 75 percent
of :onvictions in cases that were overturned
with DNA evidence had previously relied on
eyewitness testimony as the main source of
evidence.
Apart from the unreliability of eyewitness-
es, the U.S. legal system has its fair share of
problems. Poorer criminals often receive infe-
rior legal counsel and harsher penalties than
wealthier ones. Additionally, issues of race
often affect decisions in the courtroom. Mil-
tiple studies have shown that black defendants
receive harsher punishment than whites, and

when a case involves the murder of a minor-
ity, the defendants tend to receive lighter
sentences. According to the Death Penalty
Information Center, 76 percent of death row
inmates murdered white victims, and only 14
percent murdered black victims, even though
whites account for 50 percent of murder vic-
tims. Clearly, the prejudices and injustices of
society translate into the legal system.
It is also a misconception that it's more
expensive to incarcerate a person for life than
to execute him or her. This is factually incor-
rect. The California legal system would save
more than $100 million per year if it abolished
the death penalty. Currently, California tax-
payers pay about $114 million per year toward
inmates. On the contrary, taxpayers spend
upwards of $250 million for every execu-
tion the state carries out, mainly because of
the additional time and resources required.
A sentence of life in prison still undergoes
an extensive trial and appeals process, but is
drastically less costly.
The Davis case shows how even a bro-
ken system can put a man to death. But the
death penalty should be abolished, even in
the most certain of cases.It's avestigialrem-
nant of a system born not from justice, but
from revenge. More and more countries are
abolishing the death penalty because of inher-
ent flaws of criminal justice systems and its
inhumane nature. One-hundred thirty-nine
countries no longer have a death penalty, and
in 2010 the U.S. ranked fifth in number of
criminals executed - behind China, North
Korea, Iran and Yemen. The globe is moving
in a more humanitarian direction, and the
United States should do the same. The sooner
this happens, the better.

The future won't involve a
return to subsistence living
TO THE DAILY:
Daily writer and apparent doomsayer Tim
Rabb approvingly cites economist Thomas
Malthus and worries whether overpopula-
tion and resource depletion will produce a
future where we "supplant our cars with
horses and our supermarkets with backyard
farms" (Too little, too late?, 9/14/2011).
Chill out, man. The grim predictions of
Malthus and his followers have been proved
wrongtime and time again.
Malthus died in 1834. In the subsequent
150 years, the population continued to grow,
but thanks to innovations in agriculture,
fewer people starved. Still, Malthusians in
the 1970s predicted worldwide famine and

resource depletion. Paul Ehrlich, a Stanford
professor and overpopulation expert, said
that by the year 2000 the United Kingdom
would consist of "a small group of impover-
ished islands, inhabited by some 70 million
hungry people." Unsurprisingly, it didn't
happen.
In nearly all corners of the world, people
are wealthier and healthier today than they
were in 1970 or 1834 - indeed, than ever
before in human history. So no matter what
happens to energy prices in the coming
decades, I'm willing to bet that the future
will not involve some worldwide return to
subsistence living. Let's not waste valuable
space on The Michigan Daily opinion page
pretending otherwise.

This year's 1000 Pitches competition has now begun.
Some of you may recognize it or the name may at least
ring a bell. But for those of you who don't know, 1000
Pitches is an annual entrepreneurial business pitch
competition held by MPowered Entrepreneurship. To
enter, students submit 30-second to three-minute long
videos discussing their business ideas in any of the
nine categories: Consumer Products, Environment,
Hardware & Tech, Health, Local Business, Mobile
App, MProvements (Improvements to the University
of Michigan), Social Entrepreneurship and Web &
Software. There are 10 finalists per category, and ifa
student wins a category he or she is awarded $1,000.
In addition to the monetary reward, winners will have
the opportunity to tour both the Google offices and the
Quicken Loans offices. Some skeptics may wonder what
the catch is. Well, there really isn't one. 1000 Pitches is
put on with the intent of driving the spirit of creativity
and innovation on our campus.
1000 Pitches began four years ago with a mission to
spread entrepreneurship on campus. In the competi-
tion's first year, MPowered members went onto campus
armed with a few laptops to record pitches and lots of
pizza to give out. During that year, MPowered's 1000
Pitches team reached its goal by receiving over 1,000
pitches. The next year, 1000 Pitches received more than
2,000 pitches and was named Project of the Year by the
Office of Student Affairs and Leadership in 2010. Last
year, 1000 Pitches challenged students to "Think Big"
and students accepted that challenge by submitting over
3,000 pitches. That made 1000 Pitches the largest stu-
dent run business pitch competition in the world.
This year, 1000 Pitches is back with a new tagline,
"My Passion. My Pitch." We want students to reach
into what they love and are passionate about, think
of ways to change and innovate it and turn that into a
pitch. We want students to be inspired, and we feel the
best way to do that is to have them turn their passions
into their pitches.

In order to best connect to students' passions, 1000
Pitches is working with student organizations around
campus to plan events and activities to involve and
impact students based onwhat theylove. Events such as
a Social Entrepreneurship Week for students interested
in service and giving back are in the works.
In addition to inspiring students, 1000 Pitches has
had winners take their ideas to the next level. The win-
ner of the 2009 Environment category has launched his
own company, June Energy, which creates affordable,
portable solar energy systems that act as sources of light
at night and also work to provide electricity. The winner
of the 2010 Health category is working on his company
SanoBio, developing a product that accelerates wound
closure times.
Of course, not all ideas have to be like those. Both
winners discussed above were passionate about their
ideas and took them forward for that reason. We want
students throughout the University to hear about 1000
Pitches and submit their ideas to us.
This year, every Tuesday for the duration of the com-
petition - the last day to submit pitches is November 11
-1000 Pitches willbe doing something fun on the Diag.
This Tuesday, we are implementing Operation: Let It
Shine. Be sure to keep your eyes open for us.
And along with keeping your eyes open, start think-
ing about your ideas. Pitch submissions have opened,
and we have a Pitch of the Week prize. The earlier
you pitch, the better chance you have of winning the
prize. Remember you can pitch up to three times, and
we recommend it because it increases your chances of
winning. To pitch online, please visit us at 1000pitches.
com. We are looking forward to seeing all of the creative
ideas that the University's leaders and the best come up
with this year, so be sure to let them be heard.

MHealthy debuts health,
fitness program for students

Students eligible
for fitness machine
raffle if health
goals are reached
By MARY HANNAHAN
Daily StaffReporter
Students who eat healthier
and increase their fitness this
fall may be rewarded by the
University for their healthy
behaviors.
The program, called the
Active U Autumn challenge,
allows participants to set fit-
ness and health goals and win
prizes if they meet their goals.
MHealthy has offered the
Active U challenge for faculty,
staff, graduate students and
retired University employees
during recent winter terms, but
now MHealthy is also spon-
soring Active U Autumn for
undergraduate students. The
program, which is also being
sponsored by University Health
Service and Rackham Graduate
School, will debut on Oct.11 and
run through Nov.21.
After registering online,
participants determine their
health and fitness targets and
keep a log for six weeks. If they
reach their goals, they can enter
in a drawing for prizes such
as iPads, treadmills, elliptical
machines, bikes, gym member-
ships and Wii Fit game systems.
According to Katherine
Edgren, the health promotion
and community relations direc-
tor at UHS, more than 12,000

University community mem-
bers participated in Active U
last year. If the program is suc-
cessful this fall, it will continue
into the winter, Edgren said.
Apart from Active U Autumn,
University students and faculty
have access to an array of pro-
grams offered by MHealthy,
including fitness classes, per-
sonal training, nutrition con-
sultations and cooking classes.
In addition to striving to cut
health care costs and creating
a more productive workplace,
MHealthy aims to "improve the
health and wellness of employ-
ees and reduce their risk," said
Karen Schmidt, MHealthy proj-
ect senior manager.
MHealthy was started in
2005 as part of University Presi-
dent Mary Sue Coleman's vision
of promoting a culture of health
at the University, according to
Schmidt. Though MHealthy's
target audience is faculty and
staff, some programs are avail-
able to students and community
members for a fee.
Services like consultations
with registered dieticians are
free for faculty and staff, while
other programs such as fitness
classes and personal train-
ing sessions are available to all
members of the University com-
munity, Schmidt said.
"We've really tried to take
down the barriers of cost so
folks are able to participate in
these health and well-being
activities," Schmidt said. "So
we're hoping that cost won't
keep people from participat-
ing."
MHealthy has 16 certified

personal trainers on staff and
about 2,600 appointments were
made with them in fiscal year
2010, accordingto MFit wellness
coordinator Eric Breitenbeck.
Students took up fifty-seven
percent of the appointments and
35 percent by staff.
Laurie Rau, an accountant
senior for University Hous-
ing, said she has used many of
the programs MHealthy offers,
including individual coach-
ing for weight loss and online
health courses. Rau said she has
also participated in Active U in
the past, but does not plan to do
so this year because she prefers
signing up with a group of col-
leagues.
"When it first came, people
would get their groups together
and be a little competitive and it
was fun, so I don't think there's
that friendly competition," Rau
said.
LSA junior Kelsey Root said
she doesn't know much about
the MHealthy or Active U
Autumn program and probably
won't participate.
"I'm not a big goal person or
exercise person, and I don't do
well with logging and writing
down goals," Root said.
LSA freshman Zach Reilly
said he also doesn't know what
MHealthy is and hasn't heard of
Active U Autumn.
"I think it's probably a good
idea for other people, and I
know there are people who
would totally go for something
like that," Reilly said. "I don't
look down on the idea of it, but,
personally, I'm not really inter-
ested in stuff like that."

further support that the act has
increased the number of young
adults with health coverage.
Historically, young adults have
been the least likely age group to
invest in health insurance cover-
age, according to Matthew Davis,
an assistant professor in the Uni-
versity's Medical School and Ford
School of Public Policy.
Davis said the increased num-
ber of insured young adults is
"impressive."
"This is one of the early efforts
under health care reform as a
proof of principle that a change
at the federal level can translate
across the country," Davis said.
"We can see the effect of broad-
ening coverage, but we aren't see-
ing the strain on the system of a
very high number of people who
suddenly have coverage."
Young adults tend to stay on
their parents' plans since it costs
less to be a dependant, Davis said.
A single-person insurance policy
could cost more than $5,000 per
year, but a young adult depen-
dant's share of an existing plan
costs about $1,200 per year.
The lower cost has been "a very
good thing" for young adults, like
recent college graduates strug-
gling to find jobs, Davis said.
Similarly, Catherine McLaugh-
lin, a professor in the University's
School of Public Health, said the
option of remaining a dependant
on their parents' health insur-
ance plans offers young adults

respite from extraneous costs
since many people in their 20s are
already weighed down by tuition
price tags.
"Young adults, even if they
want health insurance and
they're willing to pay a premium
for health insurance, can't find
an affordable package, and they
can't get it through their employ-
er as part of a group," McLaugh-
lin said. "And this offers them
a way to stay as a dependant on
their parents until 26, when they
are more likely to be finished
with schooling, ready to get a
job in a place that offers health
insurance and get started on
their adult career."
Despitetheincreaseininsured
young adults, Dean Smith, senior
associate dean of the School
of Public Health, said he isn't
completely convinced this will
reduce health care costs. Young
adults - who McLaughlin and
other health care experts have
termed "young invincibles" -
do not tend to incur excessive
health care bills, Smith said.
"For most persons in this age
range, their assumption that
they're young and healthy and
not very likely to have cata-
strophic health care costs is, in
fact, true," Smith said. "So I don't
think that there's going to be a
big health effect from this popu-
lation now having better insur-
ance coverage."
Smith added that given the
provisions of health insurance
coverage statewide, the effects
were likely to be even less pro-
nounced in Michigan. Unlike

many policies in other states
that often terminate coverage
for young adults at ages 18, 21
or 22, several insurance plans
in Michigan - even before the
Affordable Care Act was imple-
mented - allowed young adults
to remain dependants until age
25.
Smith added that the provi-
sion wouldn't likely have a large
impact for University students.
Several years ago, Smith and
other University professors
conducted a study to exam-
ine whether health insurance
should be mandatory for Univer-
sity students. They found that
the number of students without
insurance was relatively low, as
was their economic burden -
like costs for emergency room
visits - for the University of
Michigan Health System.
Five percent of undergradu-
ates and 10 percent of graduate
students at the University did not
have health insurance as of Jan-
uary 2011, Robert Winfield, the
University's chief health officer
and director of the University
Health Service, told The Michi-
gan Daily at the time.
Still, Davis said at the option
for young adults to stay on or
join their families' plans would
be helpful for people continuing
to feel the effects of the reces-
sion. -
"I think what we're seeing
here is a lot of late teens and
twenty-somethings are taking
advantage of this option because
it makes such good sense," Davis
said.

at San Diego State. Their rela-
tionship goes far beyond just a
healthy respect for an opposing
coach. Long went so far as to
guarantee the ultimate prize for
a Hoke-led Michigan team.
"Brady will win a national
championship here," Long said
after the game.
As much as Hoke made it
about just another game, there
had to be an underlying ele-
ment, even if he didn't let it
show. There was probably
nothing different before or dur-
ing the game. He wanted the
offense to score as many points
as possible and the defense to
break Ryan Lindley's will. But
I get the sense that after the
game he felt slightly compas-
sionate. Long compared the
experience to playing your
brother. You want to beat your
brother, but you don't want to
embarrass him.
Seeing him postgame, Hoke's
fagade came down a little bit.
The raspy voice stayed and he
was still supremely sure of him-
self, but he showed emotion.
That was Hoke.

It made me feel warm and
fuzzy inside. He was just like us.
But none of it matters.
We'll all forget the hugs by
next Saturday. Most of you have
already forgotten about it. That
fourth win will stay on Michi-
gan's record for the rest of the
season. Hoke's robotic ways
have Michigan 4-0. Are those
ways the difference between
this year and the past two? Do
they bring more focus, which
will prevent the perennial Big
Ten collapse?
There's no denying some-
thing different is happening. As
robotic as Hoke is, he has a bit
of wizardry in him. Whether it's
the new scheme or not, every
time Michigan seems in danger
of blowing the game or falling
out of the game for good, they
find a way to force a turnover.
Up 7-0 with San Diego State
driving? Redshirt junior line-
backer Kenny Demens forced a
fumble.
Right after junior quarter-
back Denard Robinson threw an
interception and Aztec running
back Ronnie Hillman broke a
big run to the seven yard line?
Fifth-year senior defensive end
Ryan Van Bergen chased him
down from behind and punched

the ball out.
San Diego State trying to
bring the game within two
scores in the fourth? Sack and
fumble recovery.
Michigan still can't pass.
Denard Robinson threw for less
than 100yards for the second
straight game. It still can't kick
a field goal longer than 30 yards.
Redshirt sophomore Brendan
Gibbons missed a 40-yarder
Saturday. One more injury to the
secondary still means opposing
teams will have success chuck-
ing it deep like they're running
"Da Bomb" in "NFL Blitz."
But the Wolverines are still
4-0. Hoke has the touch. And
with three of the next four
games against the bottom tier
of the conference in Minnesota,
Northwestern and Purdue,
Michigan would need a dra-
matic collapse to not have seven
wins by the start of November.
An upset of Michigan State gives
Hoke a realistic chance at 8-0.
After watching this team for
four games, do you really think
it deserves to be 8-0?
Maybe not, but it's already
halfway there.

County previously paid closer to

Dr. Jeffrey Myers, a Univer-
sity Medical School professor and

tomic pathology division, said the
partnership benefits both parties.
The University currently
has a similar partnership with
Washtenaw County's Medical
Examiner's office, but the coun-
ty's small size doesn't generate
a sufficient number of cases to
attract fellows to the Universi-
ty's forensic pathology program,
according to Myers. The collab-
oration with the larger Wayne
County morgue will change
that, he said.
Myers added that combin-
ing the WCMEO and University
staffs will form a "core faculty

of nine forensic pathologists,"
which he described as a "huge
asset" to the University. He also
pointed out that University stu-
dents will benefit directly from
the partnership.
"Our medical students and
residents in pathology will have
opportunities to access materials
at Wayne County," Myers said.
The partnership will also save
at least $1.5 million over three
years for Wayne County, accord-
ing to a UMHS press release
issued yesterday. The press
release pointed to the partner-
ship's use of shared resources
and staffing, as well as econom-
ics of scale, as sources of cost
reduction.
Niemiec noted that foren-
sic pathologists are the only
WCMEO employees who will be
brought on the University's pay-
roll.
The WCMEO hopes the
expanded pathology staff, and

expected reduction in case vol-
ume will help the office regain
the accreditation it lost from the
National Association of Medi-
cal Examiners in 1979, Niemiec
said. The accreditation will aid
the morgue in attracting a larger
number of forensic pathologists
and employees, he added.
"We anticipate getting accred-
itation within a year or a year
and a half, and that is one of the
benefits (of the partnership),"
Niemiec said.
Though similar arrangements
between morgues and universi-
ties exist in other states, Niemiec
said Detroit's morgue is the busi-
est nationwide. In that way, he
said, it's a "precedent-setting
deal."
After the contract's three-year
period is up, there are two one-
year options available to renew
it, according to Niemiec.
"We think this is a very long-
term solution," Niemiec said.

than that, and they still need
transit service," she said.
Stasiak noted that increased
crime in the Ann Arbor area was
not a reason for the proposed
Night Ride expansion.
The AATA also plans to
increase its vanpool service.
Stasiak said the service has
become popular for residents
who live outside of the AATA
service area, many of whom are
University employees.
As a part of the service, the
AATA provides vans for groups
of commuters who are going to
similar destinations, and the
members of the vanpool con-
tribute money for fuel. Because
the state offers a limited amount
of funds for vanpool services,
AATA has decided to use money
from its own budget to provide
for expanded vanpools in Washt-

enaw County, Stasiak said.
"It's a really easy way to com-
mute," she said.
Also included in the AATA-
proposal is an airport shuttle
service, an addition residents
have been requesting for several
years, Stasiak said. The shuttle
will be the first public transit
service between the airport and
Washtenaw County.
"We have issued a request for
proposals, and we are evaluat-
ing those proposals," Stasiak
said.
The AATA airport shuttle
isn't intended to compete or take
the place of airBus - an airport
shuttle for University students
sponsored by The Michigan Stu-
dent Assembly. The airBus costs
$7 or $11 per person depend-
ing on the trip and reservation
status, according to the airBus
website.
"That service plays a very,
very important role when there
are a tremendous amount of pas-

sengers traveling between the
airport and Ann Arbor at really
high-peak periods, and we don't
see ourselves replacing that at
all," Stasiak said. "In fact, we
would encourage people to use
that service."
Residents are encouraged
to comment on the projected
changes to Route 4 and the pro-
posed airport service, Stasiak
said. AATA will also be hosting
a public forum at the Michigan
Union.
City Council member Tony
Derezinski (D-Ward 2) praised
AATA for addressing the shifting
and various needs of residents.
"The plan is comprehensive in
that it not only encompasses the
areas that we should be address-
ing, but also the different modes
of transportation," Derezinski
said. "It's a very good plan, one
I think that will be particularly
welcomed by people who come
into Ann Arbor and the commu-
nities around here."


WHITE MARKET
From Page 1A
building on East William Street
was also home to the historic
College Shoe Repair shop before
it closed its doors at the end of
December after 70 years. On the
second floor of the building are
five apartments the new land-
lord plans to renovate, accord-
ing to Brendan Cavender, who,
with Jim Chaconas, handled the
building sale for Colliers Inter-
national.
Jones said the focus of White
Market, which first opened in
1949, is to provide the freshest
products to students.
"We know our customers,
and we care about our cus-

tomers," Jones said. "They're
not just numbers or blips on a
screen."
Jones added that unlike the
larger chain stores that opened
recently on State Street, White
Market offers fresh meat and
produce.
"We sell a lot of fresh food.
People think they're getting that
at7-Eleven or CVS,but they don't
do anything in-house," Jones
said. "All CVS has (is) national
buying power and a big ad."
Cavender and Chaconas said
they're open to talking to Jones
about renewing his lease but
also noted there has been a lot
of interest in the space. These
include national establish-
ments, food chains and smaller,
local companies, according to
Cavender.

The East William area also
faces a changing business land-
scape with the construction
of Zaragon West on 500 East
William St. The new apartment
complex, which Cavender said
will open next fall, will house a
retail business.
"William Street is the next
hot market," Cavender said.

Gunfire unleashed
at facility formerly
used by American
officials in 2001
KABUL, Afghanistan (AP)
- A building used by the CIA in
Kabul came under attack Sunday,
U.S. and Afghan officials said, the
latest in a series of attacks in the
Afghan capital.
Afghan authorities said gun-
fire was heard in the evening near
the Ariana Hotel, a building that
former U.S. intelligence officials
said was the CIA station in Kabul.
The CIA occupied the heavily
secured building just blocks from
the Afghan presidential palace in
late 2001 after the U.S.-led inva-
sion that toppled the Taliban.
There was no immediate word
on casualties.
A U.S. official confirmed there
was an attack on a facility used by
American officials in Kabul.
"The situation is fluid, and the
investigation is ongoing," the offi-
cial said, speaking on condition of
anonymity because of the sensi-
tivity of the situation.
Officials at the U.S.-led coali-
tion headquarters nearby said
they heardthe gunfire, but did not
have details about the incident.
All the officials in Afghanistan
spoke on condition of anonymity
because they were not authorized
to speak to the media.

The attack came two weeks
after militants fired rocket-pro-
pelled grenades and assault rifles
at the U.S. Embassy, NATO head-
quarters and other buildings, kill-
ing seven Afghans. No embassy or
NATO staff members were hurt
in the 22-hour assault, but accu-
sations over who was responsible
have plunged U.S. relations with
Pakistan to new lows.
The top U.S. military officer,
Adm. Mike Mullen, last week
accused Pakistan's Inter-Services
Intelligence agency of supporting
insurgents in planning and exe-
cuting the Sept. 13 attack as well
as a truck bomb days earlier that
wounded 77 American troops.
The insurgents, from the
Haqqani network, are affiliated
with the Taliban and al-Qaida.
The group primarily operates in
eastern Afghanistan and is often
blamed for attacks in Kabul.
Senior Pakistani officials have
lashed out against the allegations
of support for the Haqqani net-
work, accusing the U.S. of trying
to make Pakistan a scapegoat for
its troubled war in Afghanistan.
Pakistan also is receiving criti-
cism from Afghanistan.
Afghan defense officials
warned Pakistan on Sunday to
stop firing rockets and heavy
artillery into the northeast of
the country or the military will
respond with force. Pakistan
denied it was responsible.
In its strongest condemnation
to date, the Afghan Defense Min-

istry accused the Pakistani army
of firing more than 300 artillery
rounds and rockets into Kunar
and Nuristan provinces during
the past five days.
The area is a haven for hard-
core insurgent groups fighting in
both Pakistan and Afghanistan.
U.S.-led coalition forces have a
light footprint in the area and
the cross-border fighting high-
lights NATO's struggles to pacify
the remote region. It also under-
scores the lack of cooperation
between Afghanistan and Paki-
stan against their common foes.
The ministry said an unknown
number of Afghan civilians have
been killed by the shelling coming
from Pakistani territory. Several
houses and mosques have been
destroyed and hundreds of people
have been displaced from their
homes, the ministry said.
"Once again, the Pakistani
army started firing heavy artil-
lery and rockets over innocent
Afghan people from the other
side of the Durand Line," the
statement said, referring to the
disputed 19th century demarca-
tion between Afghanistan and
Pakistan.
Pakistan army spokesman Maj.
Gen. Athar Abbas said he had
asked security officials in the area
of the reported shelling about the
allegations and was waiting for a
reply. He said those officials were
surprised by the accusations
since no activity had been report-
ed in the area.

annual general conference in
November. The party's leader
automatically becomes the
prime minister.
The announcement was made
in a brief statement credited to
Golding and the party. It said
Golding informed its central
executive committee of his
decision at a quarterly meeting
in the capital of Kingston. The
63-year-old Golding is a veteran
lawmaker who was expected to
lead his party into the 2012 gen-
eral elections.
"(Golding) said the chal-
lenges of the last four years
have taken their toll and it was
appropriate now to make way
for new leadership to continue
the programmes of economic
recovery and transformation
while mobilizing the party
for victory in the next general
elections," the statement said.
Dennis Meadows, a senator
and member of the Jamaica
Labor Party's executive com-
mittee, said there has been
an "overwhelming response"
for Golding to stay on as party
leader.
"He feels the chances of
the party winning the next
elections are at a disadvan-
tage with him at the head, but
there's no questioning of his
competence," Meadows said.
Later in the day, party
chairman Mike Henry said
the central executive voted
to reject Golding's decision to
resign as party leader. Howev-
er, Information Minister Daryl
Vaz said on local radio that the
decision about the prime min-
ister's upcoming resignation
was final.
Education Minister Andrew
Holness, also from the Labor
Party, dominated a poll con-
ducted earlier this year asking
islanders who should lead the
Caribbean country if Golding
were to step down.
Golding's career has been in
jeopardy since 2009 because
of his handling of the extradi-
tion of Jamaican drug kingpin
Christopher "Dudus" Coke to
the United States. Critics have
slammed Golding for allowing
the contracting of a law firm
to lobby Washington to drop
their request for extradition.
Golding resisted Coke's
extradition for nine months,
arguing the U.S. indictment
on gun and drug trafficking
charges relied on illegal wire-
tap evidence. Golding's Parlia-
ment district included Coke's
West Kingston slum strong-
hold.
The stance strained rela-
tions with Washington, which
questioned Jamaica's reliabili-
ty as an ally in the fight against

drug trafficking.
When Golding finally agreed
to send Coke to the U.S., a hunt
for the fugitive led to days of
fighting in May 2010 that killed
at least 73 civilians and three
security officers. Coke was cap-
tured about a month later and
extradicted.
Last month, Coke pleaded
guilty to racketeering and
assault charges, admitting his
leadership of the brutal Shower
Posse gang. He is due to be sen-
tenced in December.
The Coke controversy
prompted Golding to offer his
resignation last year, but it was
rejected by his party.
Peter Phillips, a spokesman
for the main opposition People's
National Party, asserted that the
ruling party's announcement
was brought on bythe Coke saga,
one of the bloodiest episodes in
Jamaica's recent history, and the
government's inability to fix the
island's poor economy.
"I think it is reflective of the
low standing the prime min-
ister has amongst the Jamai-
can people. His credibility was
destroyed in the Christopher
Coke fiasco," Phillips said dur-
ing a Sunday phone interview.
From its national executive
council gathering in the north-
ern city of Montego Bay, the
People's National Party called
on Golding to immediately call
general elections "to resolve the
crisis of governance in the coun-
try."
Golding, the son of a suc-
cessful businessman who also
served in Parliament, returned
his party to power in 2007 after ,
18 years in opposition.
Last year, he vowed to crush
street gangs and replace their
strong-armed rule with social
programs for the poor. While
security forces have since
launched a sustained crack-
down on gangs that has resulted
in decreases in homicides and
other crimes, Jamaica's sprawl-
ingunderclass is still struggling.
Golding has repeatedly
denied any ties to Coke, and
even resigned from the Labor
Party in the mid-1990s to form
a new party that would be free
of gang links. He rejoined Labor
in 2002.
Political observers say Gold-
ing could not have been elected
to his parliament seat without
the support of Coke, the former
don of Tivoli Gardens, which
has a long-standing reputation
as a vote-rich stronghold for the
Jamaica Labor Party. Coke also
thrived under the opposition 4
People's National Party, which
led the island for nearly two
decades before Labor's 2007
win.

EXHIBIT EXTRAS
Colossal collections

At the start of "Pulp Fic-

L. Jackson) and Vincent
(John Travolta) engage in an
extended dialogue about "le Big
Macs" and
foot massages
en route to
their early
morning hit
job, Jules
perfectly
summarizes
the television
development KAVI
process: SHEKHAR
"Well, the PANDEY
way they
make shows
is, they make one show. That
show's called a pilot. Then they
show that show to the people
who make shows, and on the
strength of that one show they
decide if they're going to make
more shows. Some pilots get
picked and become television
programs. Some don't, become
nothing. She starred in one of
the ones that became nothing."
The "she" in question is Mrs.
Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman),
wife of the pair's boss, who par-
ticipated in the failed pilot "Fox
Force Five." Assuredly, the pilot
sounded terrible, but what if it
wasn't? What if it was absolute
dynamite, the seed of an Emmy
dynasty? Does anyone really
know besides the creative staff, a
few executives and a handful of
test audiences?
The answer was "no" in 1994
and 17 years later, it's still a
resounding "no." A group of suits
still decides which pilots are
picked up based on God-knows-
what (possible explanations:
personal preferences, extrapola-
tion of test data, CEO shtupping
the lead actress). The media
landscape has evolved astonish-
ingly in the last two decades, but
the simple process of choosing
which pilots get picked up has
not. And that's bad for every-
body.
Here's my proposal: Post the
pilots online - be it Hulu, You-
Tube or the networks' own web-
sites - and let the public sample
the fare, allowing viewers the

powers of rating and comment-
ing. Networks can gauge the
popular reaction to their shows,
identifying the surefire success-
es, the dead-on-arrival disasters
and the ones nobody gives two
shits about. By dodging potential
turkeys, networks would avoid
the costs of picking the stink-
ers up to series, buying titanic
Times Square billboards to mar-
ket them and using up prime real
estate on their schedules.
Take the case of "Lone Star,"
the FOX show all the critics
were drooling over last fall.
Despite the rabid acclaim and a
plum post-"House" timeslot on
Monday nights, it premiered to a
paltry 4.1 million viewers. After
dropping to an audience of just
3.2 million for its second episode,
the show was promptly canceled,
leaving who-knows-how-much
in sunk marketing and produc-
tion costs alongside the oppor-
tunity cost of picking up "Lone
Star" over all the other pilots
that could have been successful
in its place. If the pilot had been
placed online in advance, maybe
FOX would have noticed that
nobody gives two shits about a
network show about a con man
living two separate lives.
But wait! There's more - this
game plan would also generate
free publicity for the networks,
getting viewers jazzed for future
episodes and spreading the
word to their social networks
months in advance. Add to that
the feeling of attachment and
satisfaction from seeing a show
you championed making it asa
series, shepherding a pilot out of
the Valley of Darkness and into
the fall schedule.
Speculations as to why net-
works would be resistant to
this idea are sparse. The main
possibility is that networks
want to preserve the element of
surprise, ensuring that viewers
turn up in big numbers during
premiere weeks to please the,
advertisers. But as an executive
or an ad man, I'd rather leave
viewers unsurprised for the first
episode than wake up the next
morning and learn my series
just tanked in the ratings. If

movies are 100-meter dashes,
then TV shows are marathons,

Exhibits are just
the start for 'U'
museum holdings
By LUCY PERKINS
Daily Arts Writer
"You'll see on my left that
there are falcon and hawk mum-
mies," said Sebastian Encina,
Collections Manager of the
Kelsey Museum of Archeology,
on a tour of the collections room.
"We have other mummies too -
two humans as well as a cat and a
bird that are both on display."
These mummies make up
a miniscule fraction of the
Kelsey's collection, which rolls
in at around 110,000 pieces
- just enough to fill the Big
House. And that's just one of a
total of seven on-campus muse-
ums - the University is home
to Museums of Natural History,
Anthropology, Paleontology,
Zoology, Dentistry and Art.
"Our collections focus on
classical art and archeology
which is, broadly speaking,
Roman, Greek, Egyptian, Medi-
terranean and Near Eastern,"
Encina said. "They came from
mostly excavated sites, primar-
ily from Egypt."
According to Encina, at any
given time only some 2,000
pieces are on display, equating to
less than two percent of Kelsey's
entire collection. It sounds
small, but it's an impressive
amount considering how large
the entire collection is.
Across State Street at the Uni-
versity of Michigan Museum of
Art, one can find similar statis-
tics.
According to Orian Neumann,
Chief Registrar of Collections
and Exhibitions at UMMA, the
art collection has a total of more
than 19,000 works - and it's still
growing.
"But, we can only display
2,000 pieces of our collection,"
Neumann said.
Ruth Slavin, the education
and curatorial Deputy Director
of UMMA, spoke to the broad-
ness of UMMA's collection.
"We have an extensive collec-
tion of Korean pottery and Asian
paintings and art," she said. "It's
really a large scope of everything
from areas all over the world."
According to Slavin, UMMA
is one of the leading university
museums in the country, even
though the University's collec-
tion is smaller than Harvard's or
Yale's.
Slavin explained that one of
the ways UMMA has increased
the amount of work it can have
on display is through "open stor-
age," a term coined by many mod-

Visitors to UMMA can see only 2,000 pieces from a collectionof over 19,000.

ern museums. This refers to the
use of tables that display several
pieces on top of each, but also
have drawers that can be pulled
out to see other related works.
"Where once there were five
works of art, there's now 50,"
Neumann said. "Instead of put-
ting things extremely selectively
in a case or on a wall, we have a
dense display that allows you to
see more."
Unfortunately, even through
the use of innovative displays,
UMMA can only have just over
10 percent of its burgeoning col-
lection on exhibition. So where
does everything not on display
go?
At both the Kelsey Museum
and UMMA, recent museum
expansions now provide new
storage facilities that house
everything not a part of a cur-
rent exhibit.
Encina continued the tour
of the underground collec-
tions room, located beneath
the Upjohn Wing, which was
completed in 2008. The walls
are lined by rows of 80 airtight
metal cabinets that stretch well
beyond one's head.
Each cabinet in the climate-
controlled storage facility has
big, round silver handles and
can only be unlocked with one of
Encina's many color-coded keys.
Opening a cabinet at the end
of the first aisle, Encina pulled
out a drawer to reveal ancient
Islamic vessels with small holes
at the mouth that served as a
water filter.
At the end of the second aisle,
Encina pressed several beeping
buttons and arrows on a key-
pad. Reminiscent of the moving
staircases in Hogwarts, rows of

cabinets suddenly began gliding
away from one another, creat-
ing an aisle where cabinets were
crammed together just moments
before.
According to Slavin, mod-
ern storage technology like this
exists at UMMA as well, and is
vital to the accessibility of col-
lections.
"We're part of a major
research university, and accessi-
bility to our collections has great
benefit to teaching," Slavin said.
Although it seems exhibits
hardly scratch the surface of
the multitudes these museums
have to offer, there are ways to
see more than what's behind the
glass displays.
Because of the storage system
that UMMA has acquired, pro-
fessors and scholars are able to
request viewings of specific art-
works that previously would be
more difficult to retrieve.
According to Neumann, pro-
fessors will often request visits
to UMMA with their classes to
have a more hands-on experi-
ence with objects from the time
periods they're learning about.
With the Museum's expansion,
these groups can now study
pieces from UMMA's collection
in one of two private classrooms,
making for an exciting learning
experience.
"You get to be very up close
with them," Neumann said.
"Students don't believe it's the
real thing."
The focus of education plays
a key role in the mission of both
the Kelsey Museum and UMMA.
Though the majority of their col-
lections are hidden at the end of
hallways behind cabinet doors,
they're never lost.

Nothing but abs in Abduction

It's a sexless and criminally dull
attempt to prove that a Tiger

Billed as an action thrill-
er, "Abduction" is basically a
tweenage riff on the "Bourne"
series, without a thistle or thorn
in the formula. Lautner ("The
Twilight Saga: Eclipse") plays a
high schooler (with a lot of indi-

out that his folks, Maria Bello
("Beautiful Boy") and Jason
Isaacs ("Harry Potter" series)

Under the influence of any
director and not first-timer Rich-
ard Ayoade, "Submarine" could
have regressed
into a conceited *
piece of machin-
ery. Thankfully, Submarine
what is deliv-
ered is a soulful At the
work, whose Michigan
substance is The Weinstein
empowered by Company
its style.
Ayoade confi-
dently leads his audience forward
through this coming-of-age tale
about a Welsh teenager named
Oliver Tate, played by an excellent
Craig Roberts ("Young Dracula").
As a boy caught in between social
alienation and an emotionless
marriage, Roberts is able to con-
vey the heaviness of a tired soul
and the naive romanticism of a
teenager. He is full of confusion
and angst, looking only to sub-
merge himself in the scene - like
a "submarine."
This submarine metaphor can
be found throughout the entire
film, embodying his helplessness
and pain, and itelevates the entire
story. Like a submarine, Oliver is
unseen. He observes and com-
mentates,providingasardonically

humorous voice amid his parents'
crumbling marriage that proves
to be immediate and insightful.
But these innermost thoughts are
impossible to express because he
is a timid, awkward boy. He lives
in a world that is underwater, bur-
ied beneath his fear and his inabil-
ity to properly communicate.
Created by a director bent on
style and laughs, "Submarine"
could have deteriorated into a
raunchy mess made simply of
characters and easy punchlines.
Ayoade wisely avoids this pitfall.
Without grandiose voice-overs
from Hollywood names, but with
a witty script, talented leads and
energetic style, Ayoade sinks the
audience to the depths of Oliver,
presenting a film told squarely
from the point of view of his
complex but ultimately likeable
personality.
Ayoade's camera urgently
moves and swoops through each
frame that mimics Oliver's anxi-
ety and anger, and respectfully
stops to freeze tender moments
without any of the titillation
many films refuse to pass over.
Title screens are ushered in
alongside mockingly dramatic
music. Oliver's narration is pres-
ent throughout the film, but it
is hardly intruding. These ele-
ments work with each other in
a cohesive manner and do not at

all compete with one another.
They offer humanity, allowing
"Submarine" to succeed as both
a fresh, dark drama and a roman-
tic comedy. It's an immersive tale
with each of its scenes colored
with techniques that never strike
the viewer as pretentious or
indulgent. This is merely a vision
of a very real reality, whose fea-
tures are enhanced solely for the
purpose of bringing the charac-
ters directly to the audience.
Film floats
on acting and
camera work.
"Submarine" delivers truths
of childhood and adolescence
that very few could deny mat-
ter or exist. While this film is
only an adaptation of a novel by
Jon Dunthorne and not truly
Ayoade's original creation, his
ability to present the charac-
ters within the frame of the sil-
ver screen is nothing short of
impressive. One could think of
it as a skillful balance between
realism and surrealism, or com-
edyversus drama - or maybe it's
just great storytelling.

FILM REVIEW TV REVIEW
2, 'Broke Girls' isn't poor


The 'King' is back

Three dimensions
bring Disney classic
to younger viewers
By MACKENZIE METER
Daily Arts Writer
In 1994, "The Lion King" was
released as Disney's 32nd ani-
mated film. This feature-length
cartoon carried on the rich tradi-
tion of Disney films - of course
characterized by memorable plots
and characters ripped off from
centuries-old sources (see works
by the brothers Grimm, the Bible
and Shakespeare) and harried
parents ushering their screaming
children into a darkened theater,
praying for an hour-long distrac-
tion for their children under the
guise of "family time." In 1994, I
was among these screaming chil-
drenabout to experience a"movie
theater" film for the first time.
Lucky for this no-longer-three-
year-old, "The Lion King" is a
pretty impressive film to call a
first. It's hailed by critics not only
as one of the best animated films
in the history of cinema, but also
one of the best movies of all time.

The critics love the art direction,
the characterization, the overall
message - all of these things and
more. However, five-year-olds
seem to be able to grasp some-
thing that critics just can't - what
makes "The Lion King" great lies
in the simple fact that it's a sensory
overload. It occupies young minds
with a barrage of noise, constant
flurries of activity and most of all,
Pumbaa and his song about farts.
. Ranked number one in the box
office during the first week of its
two-week run, "The Lion King"
has returned to the silver screen
with a rush. And if it wasn't a
sensory overload before, now it's
in 3-D - so hold on to your hats.
Now the stampede will be rush-
ing directly towards the audience
at a breakneck speed, and Rafiki
will lift baby Simba into a sky that
looks downright touchable. One
must pause for a moment, how-
ever, and wonder if some of these
scenes will be a bit much for small
children to handle - imagine
being four and being convinced
that there's actually a giant, blood-
thirsty hyena circling you and
your friends. It's sort of scary.
"The Lion King" is one of the
last hand-drawn greats in the

world of feature-length animat-
ed films. In our day - until "Toy
Story" changed the game - that's
all we had. Gone are the days
when a movie was based entirely
upon the skills of a pen-and-paper
artist, his or her renderings and an
ability to put it all together. These
days, cartoons sometimes feel cold
and foreign - the perfect edges
and lines of computer animation
utterly lack the telltale, comfort-
ing signs of the human touch.
However, computer animation
is to today's children what hand
drawn cartoons were to mine.
What's even better is a mixture of
these two things. And what bet-
ter way to mesh old-school hand-
drawn animation with today's
technology-obsessed culture? Put
it in 3-D.
Anyone can poo-poo the cur-
rent fixation on 3-D as well as
anything classified as bigger,
stronger, faster, better. Of course
we will always believe that our
cartoons were better and that our
childhood was the only way to
have a childhood. The important
thing is the younger generations
will have the opportunity to see
a movie in theaters that for many
of us symbolizes the comfort-

Whitney Cummings is the
hottest thing in television this
fall. Not only does she run and
star in "Whitney" over on NBC,
but she's also the co-creator of
this show. Maybe that's why "2

boy, is it ever. Kat Dennings
("Nick and Norah's Infinite
Playlist") is self-described "dead
inside" waitress Max, and Beth
Behrs ("Serial Buddies") plays
Caroline, the daughter of a con-
victed Ponzi artist. The stale
archetypes don't stop there.
There's a douchebag boyfriend,
a gang of stoner buddies and
even an Asian restaurant owner
with comically bad English, all

ally don't think there actually
are any. I can't tell if it's because
Nintendo can't convince third-
party publishers to develop big
games, or because Nintendo is
confident the Wii will continue
to sell no matter what. Whatever
the reason, it's bizarre that the
market for Wii games seems to
have disappeared overnight.
Of course, Nintendo does still
have big games coming out this
year for its platforms. "Mario
Kart 7" and "Super Mario 3D
Land" are both marquee titles
for the 3DS, as . are "Kirby's
Return to Dream Land" and
"The Legend of Zelda: Skyward
Sword" for the Wii. But these are
only four games. Compared to
the bevy of high quality games
that have been released for the
Xbox 360, PS3 and PC this year,

the release schedule for Ninten-
do looks anemic. Furthermore,
all of Nintendo's major games
for the fall are made internally
by the company. The big N has a
history of struggling to get third
party publishers to make games
for its platforms, and 2011 is
proof of that.
It would be silly to think Nin-
tendo is down for the count. It's a
veteran company that has made
some risky moves in the past to
achieve great success. But, as
this year has shown, even the
biggest video game companies
will face adversity if they don't
have, well, games. If Nintendo
can't figure out a way to release
quality games on its platforms
more consistently, it'll be hard
pressed to match the level of suc-
cess it has had in the past.

MICHIGAN 28, SAN DIEGO STATE 7
Robinson helps Hoke beat former team, former QB

By TIM ROHAN
Daily Sports Editor
Would Brady Hoke trade Denard Rob-
inson for Ryan Lindley?
Would he choose his newer, sleeker,
faster quarterback or his former tall,
prototype, NFL-made model?
The junior quarterback Robinson
made several good arguments on Satur-
day, running for 200 yards for the third
time in his career, and three touchdowns,
tying a career high. Plus, his team won -
Robinson and the 22nd-ranked Wolver-
ines beat Lindley and the rest of Hoke's
former players at San Diego State 28-7,
improving to 4-0 on the season.

So what's the debate?
Well, Robinson did most of his talking
with his legs, not his arm. Tradition says
quarterbacks aren't supposed to pass
for less than 100 yards in consecutive
weeks, as Robinson has, and be consid-
ered stars.
Denard Robinson isn't traditional.
Hoke and offensive coordinator Al
Borges are realizing that, because the
offense that Robinson ran on Saturday
was hardlyrecognizable from the one
Aztecs' quarterback Lindley played in
the past two years under Borges and
Hoke.
"If the best player on the field - and
I'm talking about both teams now - the

best player is a spread quarterback, it's
not unusual that they're in the spread
about 80 percent of the time," said San
Diego State coach Rocky Long, Hoke's
former defensive coordinator.
"Every once in awhile they line up the
same way and they hand the power play,
and they ranI thinka couple sprint outs.
And they ran a bootleg or two, but that's
the only thing that looks like last year's
(San Diego State) offense. The rest of it is
spread, which is smart."
In the first quarter, it seemed like the
debate would beover rather quickly.
Robinson'sthird snap of the game was
a nifty 19-yard run. Three plays later, he
scored an easy follow-the-leader five-

yard touchdown.
Three plays later, Robinson and junior
running back Vincent Smith ran a rare
option play. Seeing no one between
him and the endzone, Robinson knifed
through the line for a 53-yard touch-
down run.
Long's sophisticated 3-3-5 defense
blitzed Robinson too often in the first
half. So Robinson, Smith and redshirt
sophomore running back Fitz Toussaint,
who started at running back, ran past
the pressure and into the open space
behind it.
When Long adjusted, dropping his
players back in coverage in the second
half, Robinson had an even tougher time

throwing the ball.
Receivers were underthrown. His feet
weren't always set. Sometimes Robinson
had all day to throw. And he just missed
his receiver or, on a couple of occasions,
made poor decisions.
The instance came on a third down,

Aztecs give 'tribute' to former
coaches, Countess shines as sub

Lindley, Hillman hounded by Blue

By KEVIN RAFTERY
Daily Sports Editor
During the Michigan football team's
28-7 victory over San Diego State on
Saturday, several Michigan coaches
- including head coach Brady Hoke
- spent the entire
game on the Aztecs' NOTEBOOK
sideline.
But don't panic - the coaches were
on the Michigan sidelines, too. The
only difference was they were in their
full human form on the Wolverines'
sideline. For the Aztecs, they were sim-

ply signs indicating formations.
Throughoutthe game, the San Diego
State coaches held up pictures of all
the coaches and administrators who
departed the team last year for Michi-
gan. Each picture represented a differ-
ent type of play for the Aztecs.
"We chose the pictures based on, we
know those guys and we respect those
guys," San Diego State coach Rocky
Long said. "They related to certain cov-
erages by their personalities."
For example, Hoke, who is known
for his defensive mind, represented

It was only after the San Diego State
players removed their helmets and
approached him after the game that
Michigan coach Brady Hoke recog-
nized his offense from last season.
NFL-caliber quarterback Ryan Lind-
ley was harassed in the pocket. And
Heisman Trophy candidate Ronnie
Hillman was contained by the Michi-
gan defense in the Wolverines' 28-7
victory.
It was the most lopsided Aztec defeat
since Hoke led them to a 38-7 loss to
then-No. 18 Utah on Nov. 21, 2009 -

also the last time a defense held San
Diego State to a single-digit score.
Hoke's Aztec teams the past two sea-
sons averaged 35 points per game. Now
his Michigan defense nearly shut them
out.
Prior to the game, defensive coor-
dinator Greg Mattison gathered the
Michigan defense at the hotel - and
later in the locker room - to stress the
importance of playing sound defense
from the first snap.
In their three previous games, the
Wolverines suffered through open-
ing drives of 74, 57 and 55 yards, twice
allowing touchdowns. Against the
Aztecs, Michigan took control of the

line of scrimmage early, snothering
Hillman behind the line on third-and-
one to force a punt on the first set of
downs.
Three and out, just the way Mattison
wanted it.
"(Michigan's defense) had alot to do
with us playing poorly," said San Diego
State coach Rocky Long. "We played
poorly in the first half, so obviously I
did a bad job coaching."
On San Diego State's next possession,
Hillman fumbled the ball away. Later,
he did it again -both times inside
Michigan territory.
It was only the second and this

MEN' CRS COUNT
Forys leads 'M'
to win over pair
of ranked foes

DAVID CASSLEMAN
Daily Sports Writer
Michigan fifth-year senior
cross country runner Craig
Forys, an All-Big Ten selection,
decided not to travel with the
team to Illinois last weekend.
Instead, he stayed in Ann Arbor
to complete some extra training
sessions.
"There was not much for me
to gain by running that race, so
I decided to do some extra train-
ing and wait to open up and get
my season going this week,"
Forys said.
The extra week of preparation
paid off.
Racing in the heat and humid-
ity of Gainesville, Fla., at the
Florida Mountain Dew Invita-
tional, Forys led the Wolver-
ines to a team victory against 16
opponents. Individually, Forys
won with a time of 24:35.55,
finishing ahead of runners from
No. 28 Florida and No. 30 North
Carolina.
Forys did not take the lead
until the final 200 meters of the
8,000-meter race. Facing a hill
climb and a final turn, Forys
worked quickly past the Gator
runner between him and the fin-
ish line.
"I moved hard and he didn't
respond," Forys said.
Senior All-Big Ten - run-
ner Bobby Aprill placed third
(24:39.73), while sophomore
Morsi Rayyan finished tenth
(24:05.80).
"The guys set up well," said
Michigan coach Alex Gibby.

"North Carolina was aggressive
in the early going, and our guys
were on their heels a little bit.
But the guys got in the flow and
the tide began to turn."
With a mile left to go, the
humidity seemed to be too much
to handle for the Wolverines'top
fifth and sixth runners - fresh-
man Mason Ferlic and junior
Zach Ornelas - who dropped
back, but still managed to finish.
Michigan would have won by a
comfortable margin if it had kept
to its initial pace.
The question of the team's
depth seems to have been at least
partially answered after the vic-
tory in Gainesville, and the win
could also prove to be more than
just a confidence booster for the
Wolverines. The win against
ranked opponents might allow
the Wolverines to gain an at-
large bid to the NCAA National
Championships. For now, Michi-
gan feels good about its quality
early-season win.
"Ifyourace poorly, you kind of
have to fix whatyou did wrong,"
Gibby said. "But if you do well,
you build upon that. You are a
couple steps up the ladder. It's
nice to see some reward on our
initial investments."
Still, Gibby warned his team
against complacency.
"I don't want anyone being
too confident," Gibby said. "We
stress trying to stick with the
process of being good. If we are
focused on the process of being
good, our experience in Florida
can help us be more progressive
in our ambitions."

enard Robinson has
always been elusive.
The nation's fourth-

picked up a
football in
his home-
town of
Deerfield
Beach, Fla.
After

quicker than
Denard him-
self was his follower count. He
reached 10,000 followers by 2
p.m. the next day.
But on his 21st birthday last
Thursday - Sept. 22 - Rob-
inson put himself on a tee.
He invited 25,000-plus to his
birthday party at a local bowl-
ing alley.
"Come out to colonial lanes
for my birthday tonight at
10pm!" Robinson wrote on his
Twitter account, @DenardX.
"No autographs, no photos, just
fun."
But that was just the A-list.
Hundreds of his followers
hit the retweet button, passing
the invite on to thousands more
people.
Robinson's original tweet
later disappeared - but the
message was sent and quite a
crowd arrived to Colonial Lanes
to wish the star quarterback a
happy 21st.
When asked about the bowl-
ing event during the press con-
ference on Sunday, Robinson

laughed, then leaned forward in
his chair and hit his head on the
table three times.
He said little, just laughed.
For a player so humble and
reserved, he didn't expect quite
the response he'd gotten.
"We went out bowling, had a
good time," he said quietly.
The truth came out: a good
crowd saw Robinson bowl con-
secutive games of 200, 160 and
170. It was a good birthday.
But as for his tenure on Twit-
ter, it might be coming to a
close.
"I don't know, man," Robin-
son said. "Twitter? I don't know
if I'm gonna keep tweeting. I
don't want these questions com-
ing up here."
In truth, Robinson wasn't
built for the social network
scene. His most popular post
read, "I kidnapped HARD
WORK and SUCCESS is the
ransom!"
Brilliant. Inspiring. Also

my Algebra classroom back in

So, @DenardX's days might
be numbered, but that isn't
across the board. Much of the
athletic community - even
here at Michigan - has taken to
Twitter.
And it's radically altered the
player-fan dynamic.

uncensored and unedited -

WEST LAFAYETTE - The

was a service ace, courtesy of

That MICHIGAN 3

whipped
the Boil- MICHIGAN 0
ermakers' PURDUE 3
student
section into a frenzy. The crazed
fans - basking in the score-
board's bright red glow of Purdue
3, Michigan 0 - looked as though
they were about to tear the stands
apart board by board.
With blank expressions the
Wolverines stuck to routine -
they shook hands, collected bags
and jogged into the locker room.
For all the plays and scenarios
that Michigan coach Mark Rosen
ran his team through, he never
taught it how to lose. After a spec-
tacular undefeated preseason and
conference opener, perhaps he
believed it never would.
The 18th-ranked Wolverines
lost to No. 13 Purdue in three
sets, dropping each of the first
two sets by the same 26-24. Both
teams handily won their confer-
ence openers the night before,
with Michigan sweeping Indi-
ana in three sets and the Boiler-
makers dismantling Michigan
State in similar fashion. Both the
Wolverines and Purdue also had
undefeated records entering the
weekend and shared the label of
having strong offenses. But the
Boilermakers managed to find
that slight edge to put it away.
"You don't learn stuff from
succeeding all the time," Rosen
said. "You learn a hell of a lot
more from losing. It's all about
the process. It's alongseason, and
we are looking to be the best team
we can be by the end of the year.
Tonight we failed at some things,
but we have to learn from those
failures and go from there."

From Page lB
season.
If it weren't for a wide-open
dump-screen pass to Smith,
which went for 32yards, Robin-
son would've finished the game
with 61 passingyards.
His 93 total yards through
the air were the lowest com-
plete-game total in his career.
He broke his record from a
week ago, when he threw for 95
yards.
"(Former TCU quarterback)
Andy Dalton had plenty of
problems with (that defense)
a year ago - and it's not an
easy defense to try and figure
things out," Hoke said. "But he
did a good job there in the run
game."
Every week, Borges and
Hoke key in on Robinson's foot-
work: feet set, clean pocket,
choose wisely. That was the
case several times Saturday, but
Robinson still couldn't deliver.
"They go out there and they
fly around everywhere," Robin-
son said. "So you can say it was
(the defensive scheme), but we
worked on it all week and I've
just got to execute.
"Just some throws, I
shouldn't have forced them.
Just take my time and do what
coach taught me."
In the fourth quarter, Lind-
ley looked like the NFL-caliber
quarterback Hoke spoke of
all week - feet set and follow
through. Michigan couldn't
have played better coverage on
several throws Lindley com-
pleted. But the Wolverines had
a plan early on - hit Lindley
and make him scared of getting
hit again.
"We knew that if we got in
his face, got pressure to him,
pressed the pocket on him, he'd
get happy feet and make missed
throws," said senior defensive
tackle Mike Martin. "He's a
good quarterback and he can
sling that thing around. If you
don't get in his face, he can
throw it as well as anyone."
Even with a clean pocket,
and no pressure, Lindley's
throws were off target at times.
When the pressure did come,
he got rid of the ball so early
the receivers were still running
their routes. Michigan's mind
games had no bigger impact

than on third downs, where
Lindley and San Diego State
converted just 8-of-18 attempts.
Lindley didn't have much
help from sophomore running
back Ronnie Hillman, who was
the nation's second-leading
rusher entering the game. He
fumbled twice.
Still,withLindley's11-for-25,
114-yard three-quarter perfor-
mance, the Aztecs were within
two touchdowns of upsetting
Hoke's new school after Lind-
ley threw a strike to his wide
receiver, who had a Michigan
defender draped all over him.
Then Lindley threw for 139
yards in the fourth quarter,
making NFL throw after NFL
throw - the kind of throws
Borges wished Robinson would
make.
Lindley made his case.
But the Aztecs had to stop
Robinson with eight minutes
left and the ball near midfield.
Robinson did what he does
best, sprinting for a nail-in-
the-coffin, catch-me-if-you-
can 30-yard run.
New examples arise each
week as to why Hoke shouldn't
try and pound a square peg
into a round hole. But he still
struggles with the question:
how can he play to Robin-
son's strengths and still have
a respectable West Coast pass-
ing game and a traditional
running back-led ground
attack? It's an even tougher
question if Robinson's running
ability or the threat to run is
winning games.
"We. know we just have to
sustain drives, get the ball
flowing and get in a rhythm,"
Smith said after the game.
That's up to Robinson, spe-
cifically his arm.
"I want to see what plays
he got us into," Hoke said,
defending his quarterback.
"That's something that the
quarterback never gets credit
for.
"We won the game."
Hoke's quarterback is now
the fourth-leading rusher in
the country with 552 yards,
but he's also tied for fourth-
most in interceptions thrown,
and tied for 84th in passing
yards.
But would Hoke choose
Ryan Lindley over Denard
Robinson?
Probably not.

tions Director Wendy Mayer laid
out what she believed to be the
Boilermakers' plan of attack.
"We are looking to shut down
(senior outside hitter) Alex
Hunt," Mayer said. "We want to
make her invisible. She's burned
us too many times in the past."
The Boilermakers did exactly
that - Hunt had a season low of
two killsin the first set that ended
up contributing to a total of seven
kills over the course of the match.
Although sophomore middle
blocker Jennifer Cross picked up
the slack, leading the pack with
nine kills overall, it wasn'tenough
to put Michigan over the top.
The match was relatively even
with the exception of two key
aspects - attack errors and block-
ing. The Wolverines earned twice
as many attack errors as Purdue,
and the Boilermakers doubled
Michigan's blocks.
The inverse correlation was no
accident.
Purdue had one of the biggest
front lines Michigan has seen all
season. It wasn't particularly tall,
but it was quick in the air. If a
team can be up in the air quickly,
it can block more attempts, put
the opponent on its heels, and

cause its players to augment their
shots and force errors.
The Wolverines knew this for-
mula well, because they are usu-
ally the ones imposing their will
on other teams. The shoe didn't
fit so well on the other foot this
weekend.
In sharing his feelings on the
game, Rosen harkened back to a
quote by Hunt, which she uttered
two weeks ago over dinner after
the Pepperdine win:
"Boy, what a difference two
points can make," Hunt said.
Those words haunted Rosen in
the locker room after that third
and final set. Two points in the
other direction in either the first
or second set could have yielded
an entirely different result.
"(If we had won) Purdue would
have been in the locker room
before set three asking them-
selves some tough questions,"
Rosen said. "Then we could have
jumped on them in game three,
and gutted out the win.
"What you're seeing is the
frailty of athletics. We're all just
walking on a balance beam. The
wind is blowing, and it could go
either way. We just have to find a
way to win."

DEFENSE
From Page 1B
fumbles of his careeer - his
other was on his first career
carry for Hoke last season.
Fifth-year senior defensive
tackle Ryan Van Bergen caught
Hillman from behind inside the
10-yard line and knocked the
ball loose for the second fumble.
Try reading it this way: a 288-
pound defensive tackle caught
the nation's second-leading
rusher from behind in the open
field - 30 yards away from the
line of scrimmage. Van Bergen
got a block from fifth-year senior
defensive tackle Mike Martin,
but most of his help came from
practice.
"But when it comes down to
it, we have the most explosive
player in the country in our
backfield," Van Bergen said. "We
get to play against (junior quar-
terback) Denard (Robinson),
so we've learned how to take
angles at guys who have speed.
"I took off on my horse just
thinking, 'I've almost caught
AZTECS

the goal line or short-yardage
defense.
There were other uses for the
pictures as well.
"It was our way of telling them
how much we missed them,"
Long said. "But the real reason
we used them was because they
know our signals. So we were try-
ing to figure out a way to signal
the defense to our defense with-
out them knowing exactly what
we were in."
The plan didn't work out as
well as Long would have liked.
He said the signs might have been
part of the reason the Aztecs
struggled on defense in the first
half - San Diego State gave up
208 yards on the ground, with no
answer for Michigan junior quar-
terback Denard Robinson, who
rushed for 140 yards and three
touchdowns.

Denard before, maybe I can
catch this guy."'
The lion caught the gazelle,
for once. But the whole family
feasted on Lindley.
Michigan learned early that
Lindley couldn't handle the blitz
- throwing erratically with a
collapsing pocket. So Mattison
dialed up the pressure.
"We knew that if we got in
his face, got pressure to him,
pressed the pocket on him he'd
get happy feet and would miss
throw," Martin said.
The final line on the quar-
terback read 23-for-48 passing
for 253 yards and a touchdown.
Not gaudy. Not glorious. Not the
same quarterback his old coach
remembered Ryan Lindley being.
The lone score came late in the
third quarter, when Lindley spun
a tight throw to wide receiver
Colin Lockett crossing over the
middle for a 16-yard touchdown.
It ended a nearly six-quarter
scoreless stand by the Wolver-
ines, stretching back to a field
goal by Eastern Michigan to open
the second quarter last Saturday.
"We actually thought in the
process it would help us," Long
said. "I don't think it did. It prob-
ably would have been better if we
hadn't done it.
But it was really a tribute to
them, because we're all friends
and we know they're gonna do a
great job here."
As for the Michigan players:
"We were laughing," Robinson
said. "Everybody was in that hud-
die laughing. They got pictures of
our coaches up there - it's crazy."
A YOUNG DONOVAN WAR-
REN?: In the second quarter,
fifth-year senior cornerback
Troy Woolfolk was off the field,
injured. Again.
Woolfolk has suffered vari-
ous injuries this year, including a
tweaked left ankle in the season
opener against Western Michi-
gan. And it was that same ankle
that he "tweaked" again on Sat-
urday.
"I'm sure that's day-to-day,"
Hoke said of the injury. "If I

The offense scored 52 points in
that time.
"Whenever we can watch
our offense (from the sidelines),
we always play better defense,"
Martin said.
But the Michigan offense
wasn't so kind as to oblige against
the Aztecs. Robinson threw two
interceptions and running backs
fumbled the ball away twice, put-
ting the defense back on the field.
"Don't let (turnovers) trans-
late into points, because that's
how you get beat," Van Bergen
said.
For this new Michigan
defense, there's one way to
respond.
"Get 11 hats on the ball," Van
Bergen said.
The forced turnovers came -
three fumbles. So did the stops.
Michigan made three fourth-
down stops and ten third-down
stops.
"I thought our defense kept us
in the game, because we tried to
give it away," Hoke said.
Hoke may not have recog-
nized his former offense across
know Troy, he'll come out tomor-
row and do everything that we'll
do."
Freshman cornerback Blake
Countess replaced Woolfolk,
and he made the most of his time
on the field. He recorded seven
tackles - tied for a team-high -
and broke up a pass.
"(Countess) is a talented
young guy," Hoke said. "He's
done a good job. He has great
pride in performance, so he gets
himself ready to play."
Fifth-year senior Ryan Van
Bergen compared Countess to
former Michigan cornerback
Donovan Warren, a 2009 All-Big
Ten selection and current mem-
ber of the Detroit Lions practice
squad.
"He has a swagger about him,"
Van Bergen said. "He's very con-
fident in his abilities, and I think
the more reps he gets, the more
time he'll see because I think
he'll prove that he can play. I
think the coaches are slowly get-

ting more comfortable with him
and rotating him in."
WILL IT EVER GET BETTER?:
Entering Saturday's game, red-
shirt sophomore kicker Brendan
Gibbons had only attempted one
field goal this season - a 21-yard
chip shot that he converted
against Eastern Michigan last
week.
That didn't exactly convince
Michigan fans that he's the
answer for the Wolverines' kick-
ing woes.
Gibbons and redshirt sopho-
more Seth Broekhuizen went a
combined 4-for-13 on field goals
last year, good for last in the
nation.
And on Saturday, Gibbons
didn't exactly help the cause.
With 3:30 left in the third
quarter and Michigan leading
21-0, Gibbons lined up on the
right hash for a 40-yard field
goal as the Big House collective-
ly held its breath.
He had the distance, but he

pushed it left. No good.
"I think it was just one bad
kick," Hoke said. "I can tell
you from how he planted, not
that I'm (former NFL Pro Bowl
kicker) Garo Yepremian at all or
know much about the kicking
aspect, but he just didn't plant
well and kind of pushed it."
ONE BIG, POWERFUL FAM-
ILY: When asked after the game
if there was anything about his
team that surprised him, Hoke
paused.
He made a few faces and
thought about it for a good five
seconds.
And then his face lit up.
"I like how they like each
other," he said. "I've been
around teams that don't like
each other. And if they like each
other enough and respect each
other enough, they're gonna play
for each other.
"When they play for each
other and they play for Michi-
gan, that's a powerful thing."

defensive line started to live up to the preseason hype
and kept generating turnovers. That's pretty beefy.

COUNTESS: Michigan coach Brady
Hoke said this week he expected
Countess to contribute at some
point this season. Who knew it
would be this soon? When fifth-
year senior Tiny Woolfolk left the
field injured for yet another time,
Countess saw his first action of
the season. He didn't disappoint.
Lindley tried to beat him deep.
He broke it up. They tried to run
a slant on him. He took the inside
and broke up the play, knowing
he had safety help over the top.
Countess showed why he was a
highly touted recruit coming out
of high school. He also showed
poise beyond his years. For a
secondary needing depth, it.
couldn't ask for a better debut.

his fumble against Notre Dame,
Denard Robinson wasn't there to

this season, he's fumbled twice.
He couldn't hang on to the ball
during his freshman year either.
At media day before the season,
Hopkins said he didn't fumble
much in high school, so he didn't*
