Nutrition, food 
security and fair 
trade featured in 

short lectures 

By ANNA HARITOS

Daily Staff Reporter

The University’s Sustainable 

Food Systems Initiative hosted 
10 bite-sized talks Tuesday 

night on topics related to food 
and agriculture.

The second annual “Fast 

Food for Thought” talk brought 
together nine faculty members 
from several University depart-
ments, with the 10th “talk” for-
matted as a Q&A session. Each 
of the speakers was given five 
minutes to address a broad 
range of global and local food 
topics, including sustainability, 
potential connections between 
food and politics and the grow-

ing problem of herbicide resis-
tance. The USFSI encourages 
University students and faculty 
members to learn about and 
promote food systems that are 
beneficial to both the environ-
ment and economy.

More than 100 attendees 

filled the lecture hall in the 
Dana Building. Thomas Prin-
cen, 
associate 
professor 
of 

natural resource and environ-
mental policy, started off the 
event by asking, “Why food, 

why now?” In his talk, he brief-
ly explained his six hypotheses 
for why American interest in 
food has skyrocketed in the 
past few years.

Among them: the “brains and 

hands” hypothesis. What dis-
tinguishes humans from other 
animals, Princen said, is the 
ability to combine experiences 
both tactile and intellectual. 
He said because food engages 
humans both with their brains 

Two former 
Congressmen 

address increased 
legislative gridlock

By SAMANTHA WINTNER

Daily Staff Reporter

Frustration 
with 
the 

sometimes sluggish legislative 
process isn’t unique to voters 
— a point that two former 
legislators hammered home in a 
lecture Tuesday night.

Former Congressmen Tom 

Davis (R–Va.) and Martin Frost 
(D–Texas) spoke at the Gerald 
R. Ford Presidential Library 
about legislative gridlock and 
how bipartisanship can remedy 
it, an issue they address in a new 
book they co-authored with 
journalist Richard Cohen.

Davis 
and 
Frost 
have 

a 
combined 
40 
years 
of 

congressional experience, and 
both served two terms as the 
chair of their respective party’s 

House campaign committees.

“(Because we’ve both had 

these roles), we tend to see 
things structurally the same 
way,” Frost said.

According 
to 
a 
2008 

interview with The New York 
Times, Davis decided not to run 
for re-election because he was 
dissatisfied with the partisan 
nature of Congress. At the 
time, he said party divides were 
increasingly making the process 
of lawmaking dysfunctional, 
especially as a new wave of social 
conservatives were becoming 
a dominant contingency in the 
GOP.

“I’m a partisan Republican 

and 
Martin 
is 
a 
partisan 

Democrat,” Davis said. “But we 
were dealmakers, we know how 
to work with the other side, we 
felt when the election was over, 
it was time for everyone to act 
like grown ups again and try to 
get things done.”

In their book, Davis and 

Frost elaborate on the growing 
political 
polarization

Assembly also 

hears resolution to 
add mental health 
resources to syllabi

Daily Staff Reporter

The 
Central 
Student 

Government Assembly deviated 
from its usual meeting spot 
in the Michigan Union on 

Tuesday night, convening in 
Pierpont Commons on North 
Campus 
to 
discuss 
course 

evaluations 
and 
increasing 

awareness of on-campus mental 
health services by including 
information on syllabi.

Course evaluations

A chunk of Tuesday’s meeting 

was dedicated to discussing 
the Faculty Senate’s decision 
Monday to vote against the 
immediate release of student 

course evaluation data. The CSG 
Assembly has previously pushed 
to make these course evaluations 
available to the public, and 
introduced a resolution last year 
to do so.

Public Policy junior Jacob 

Pearlman, CSG general counsel, 
noted that the course evaluation 
results, 
which 
provide 
a 

mechanism for the University 
to gauge professor proficiency, 
were originally made available 

Louise Glück 

featured in Helen 

Zell Visiting 
Writers Series

By CAMY METWALLY

Daily Staff Reporter

In 
a 
gallery 
inside 
the 

University’s Museum of Art, 
Louise Glück stood between 
two white sculptures, and read 
poetry that conjured images 
of the night sky, rain and the 
changing seasons.

Tuesday night, the Pulitzer 

Prize-winner 
and 
former 

United States Poet Laureate 
read a collection of her poetry 
for the Zell Visiting Writers 
Series, presented by the Helen 
Zell 
Writers’ 
Program. 
A 

reception and book signing 
followed the event.

Between 
poems, 
Glück 

shared some of the struggles 
she has faced in her professional 
career. She said during one low 
point in her writing, she sat at 
home reading plant catalogues 

to pass the time. Even so, she 
said this period was ultimately 
productive because later on it 
inspired a number of poems 
in her Pulitzer-winning book, 
“The Wild Iris.”

“It’s ... poems spoken by 

flowers, 
poems 
spoken 
by 

humans who are in conflict 
with each other, and poems 
spoken by some third celestial 
principle,” Glück said.

Glück 
advised 
poets 
to 

do what they want, even if 
it’s reading plant catalogues 
because, ultimately, this is how 
they will write poems of their 
own.

“You have to do what you 

want to do,” Glück said. “If you 
don’t do what you want to do, 
you will ever write poems that 
are yours alone to write.”

Glück read a number of 

poems from “The Wild Iris,” 
including “The Red Poppy.”

During the Q&A portion, 

an 
attendee 
sought 
advice 

for aspiring writers. Glück 
encouraged those interested in 
poetry and writing to read what 
they love and build a life they

and with their hands, people 
connect with food.

“Just think about what you 

have to know to grow a crop, the 
land, the weather, the markets,” 
he said. “A lot of that knowledge 
is not from food study or data it 
is from the very feel of the land. 
Maybe the increased interest in 
food that we feel more human 
when we engage with food.”

University Lecturer Margot 

Finn discussed the connection 
between fast food and social 
class. During the talk, she cited 
statistics to debunk the associa-
tion between poverty and fast 
food.

“The 2013 Gallup Poll that 

found that American house-
holds with annual income of 
over $50,000 a year were more 
likely to say they eat fast food 
on a weekly basis than lower-
income groups,” Finn said. “Fast 
food 
consumption 
increases 

along with income, peaking in 
the $60- to $70-thousand-dollar 
bracket.”

She went on to discuss how 

families with lower incomes are 
more likely to make meals from 
scratch, as prepared and restau-
rant meals are often out of their 
budgets.

“One reason for the associa-

tion between the poor and fast 
food is because people believe 
that eating fast food makes you 
fat, and poor people are strongly 
associated with fatness, and the 
other stigmatized character-
istics that go along with it like 
ignorance, laziness, apathy and 
lack of willpower,” Finn said.

After the event, LSA junior 

Lia Parks said she didn’t real-
ize how important food was in 
American culture. 

“I never realized how food 

and sustainability were so inter-
meshed in culture, and that we 
need to rethink the way we do 
and think about things,” Parks 
said.

Louise Glück, a Pulitzer Prize winning poet, reads her poetry at the University of Michigan Museum of Art on 
Tuesday. 

love.

“Read what you love,” she 

said. “You’re not going to be 
nourished by what you don’t 
love. Live the life that seems 
natural to you. That’s the 
hardest thing to learn.”

These words inspired strong 

emotion in LSA senior Maddy 
Rombes, who said she was 
nearly brought to tears by 
Glück’s words.

“She 
talked 
about 
doing 

what you love and not stressing 
too much about it,” Rombes 
said. “That’s been a recurring 
thought in my head, and that 
advice really resonated with 
me.”

Though the reading was 

open to the public, many of 
the 
attendees 
were 
faculty 

and 
students 
from 
the 

English Department and the 
Zell Program with previous 
exposure to her work.

LSA senior Marie Michels 

read 
a 
number 
of 
Glück’s 

pieces at the University’s New 
England Literature Program. 
Michels said she looked forward 
to hearing the poems in the 
author’s voice.

“I’m excited to see the person 

behind this work that I admire 
so much — to hear her voice and 
to be in the company of people 
who also really respect what 
she’s doing,” Michels said.

Hanna Poston, a Rackham 

student who is in her second 
year in the Zell Program and 
introduced Glück, talked about 
how Glück’s work inspires other 
writers.

“Fellow poets, through this 

work, I understand better what 
you are trying to do,” Poston 
said. “I understand better what 
I am trying to do.”

Poston added that Glück’s 

words bring hidden things to 
life.

“The brilliance of her vision 

and the brutal cadences of her 
lines are alive inside of us,” 
Poston said. “We’ve brought 
them into this room with us. 
Most of you know why you are 
here tonight.” 

David Ward, Zell Program 

graduate and a lecturer in the 
English Department, said he 
admires Glück for her honesty 
and realism.

“The way she structured the 

reading in terms of giving us the 
arc of her life as a writer stuck 
out,” Ward said. “The way she 
came back to the idea of having 

down times where you’re not 
writing or working at all was a 
refreshing take on the creative 
process.”

Before the event, Marlin 

Jenkins, a Rackham student in 
the Zell Program, said he was 
looking forward to hearing 
Glück speak freely, outside of 
reading her poetry.

“I hope that she does interject 

to talk about the poems and her 
process as well as reading her 
poetry,” Jenkins said. “I hope to 
hear a little bit about who she is 
as an artist in a way you can’t get 
from the page.”

Catering to fans like Jenkins, 

on Thursday, Glück and Linda 
Gregerson, director of the Zell 
Program, will hold an hour-
long conversation about poetry 
and contemporary literature 
in 
UMMA’s 
Helmut 
Stern 

Auditorium.

Airea Matthews, assistant 

director of the Zell Program, 
described 
Glück 
as 
a 

foundational voice in poetry. 
She said she hopes the reading 
inspired attendees and evoked 
emotion in each and every one.

“I hope that … they’re spoken 

to in some way, so the reading 
feels more like a conversation 
rather than anything else,” 
Matthews said.

Ole Miss removes state flag

WEDNESDAY:

In Other Ivory Towers

The Mississippi state flag 

has been removed from the 
Ole Miss campus, The Daily 
Mississippian 
reported 

Monday.

The removal of the flag 

came out of a student-led 
initiative in opposition to 
the display of Confederate 
symbols. On Oct. 20, the 
Associated 
Student 
Body 

Senate 
passed 
Resolution 

15-13, 
encouraging 
the 

flag’s removal. The Faculty 
Senate then voted to approve 
the joint passage of this 
resolution 
Oct. 
22. 
The 

final Mississippi state flag 
was removed from campus 
ceremoniously early Monday 
morning.

Morris Stocks, University of 

Mississippi interim chancellor, 
wrote in a statement that 
respectful 
discussion 

around the issue drove the 
administration to take prompt 
action.

However, the results of a 

Daily Mississippian campus 
poll also showed that Ole Miss 
students overwhelmingly do 
not support the removal of the 
flag.

Oklahoma State parade

The

Adacia Avery Chambers, 

25, was arrested on a charge 
of driving under the influence. 
She remains in custody on four 
additional counts of second-
degree murder.

OSU spokesman Gary Shutt 

said Chambers is not an OSU

observed

During Tuesday night’s talk, 
Davis noted that congressional 
redistricting, media business 
models that focus on elevating 
partisan viewpoints and the 
increasing amount of influence 
monied 
interests 
wield 
in 

politics have all contributed 
to the demise of the moderate 
politician.

“The Republican Conference 

has never been as conservative 
as it is now, and the Democratic 
Conference never as left as it is 
now,” Davis said.

Both congressmen noted that 

gerrymandering — a practice 
by 
which 
state 
legislatures 

manipulate electoral districts to 
favor one political party (likely 
the one most represented in 
the legislature) over another 
— and the consequent creation 
of 
politically 
homogeneous 

districts, has severely restricted 
split-ticket 
elections 
and 

encouraged people to vote based 
on party rather than specific 

candidates with whom they 
share values.

“If 
Picasso 
were 
alive 

today, he would not have to go 
through his ‘blue period’ for 
artistic fulfillment. He could 
be a drawer of congressional 
districts, get the same level of 
artistic fulfillment and probably 
a lot more money,” Davis said.

Frost added that, as a result 

of 
gerrymandering, 
voters 

are incentivized to elect more 
extreme candidates instead of 
moderate candidates.

“Divided 
government 
is 

kind of the new normal,” Frost 
said. “Since 1980, 80 percent 
of the time we’ve had divided 
government. One party has 
controlled the presidency and 
the other party has controlled 
at least one house of Congress.”

Davis and Frost added that 

much of the polarization and 
resulting policy deadlock that 
exists in Congress today is due 
to the increasing importance 
of primary elections on the 
makeup of government.

“Very few people lose in 

a primary, but they wake up 

CONGRESS

every morning in mortal fear 
that some well-funded, crazy 
extreme candidate in their own 
party is going to run against 
them in the primary, so they 
alter their voting patterns and 
they are less likely to cooperate 
with the other side,” Frost said.

The duo suggested that a law 

requiring states to appoint non-
partisan district commissions 
would mitigate the current 
polarization in Congress.

“That would help, and you 

wouldn’t have these crazy-
looking districts,” Frost said. 
“You’d have more competitive 
districts and the two parties 
would have to talk to each other 
— and that’s what’s missing 
right now.”

Due to contribution limits to 

national political parties, Frost 
said partisan-fueled interests 
have assumed a greater role in 
funding candidates, granting 
extreme 
factions 
enormous 

influence 
over 
politicians 

and particularly presidential 
candidates. He said super PACs 
and other well-funded groups 
and politicians often coordinate 
to manage campaigns.

Frost said either the Federal 

Election 
Commission 
or 

Congress should pass laws 
that address this issue of 
coordination, making it clear 
that it could be bad for the state 
of politics since there are no 
effective limits on the activities 
of these outside groups. They 
also advocate for more specific 
and comprehensive campaign 
finance 
and 
contribution 

reports.

“We have to do something 

about this amount of money in 
politics today because it has 
totally distorted the system, 
and again when you combine 
that with (gerrymandering), 
then there’s an incentive for 
people to never cooperate with 
the other side because they’re 
afraid some some far-right 
or far-left group will come 
in (support a more extreme 

candidate),” Frost said.

Davis and Frost also called 

for efforts to increase voter 
turnout. They emphasized this 
point in the case of primary 
elections, in which turnout 
has 
been 
historically 
low. 

As an example, according to 
Michigan’s Department of State, 
only 19.7 percent of registered 
state voters participated in 
2012’s 
presidential 
primary. 

Presidential 
election 
years 

typically see a higher voter 
turnout.

Ann Arbor resident Sven 

Hahr said he felt the former 
congressmen’s 
presentation 

was balanced and effective. In 
particular, he said he thought 
Davis and Frost’s theory on 
polarization was sensible.

“It’s always good to have 

people from both sides of the 
aisle. Otherwise you have no 
diversity of thought and one 
of the criticisms of collegiate 
America is not enough diversity 
of thought … so I thought what 
they presented was good,” he 
said.

Qaradawi’s power followed 2011 
revolution — a time that both 
accentuated the activist’s advo-
cacy of democracy. However, 
many of his views are controver-
sial in the west, and he has been 
banned from entering the U.S. 
since 1999.

“To him, what matters is poli-

tics,” Skovgaard-Petersen said, 
adding that al-Qaradawi is a per-
sonal proponent of authoritarian 
government despite his push for 
democracy.

Skovgaard-Petersen split al-

Qaradawi’s life into three differ-
ent stages of activism: movement 
activism, institutional activism 
and solutionist activism.

Al-Qaradawi, who was born 

in the Nile Delta in 1926, became 
involved in activism in the late 
1940s, joining the Muslim Broth-
erhood, an Islamist religious, 
political and social movement. 
Skovgaard-Petersen 
said 
al-

Qaradawi became a prominent 
youth activist leader after gradu-
ating from college in 1953.

1961, 
Skovgaard-Petersen 

said, was the year al-Qaradawi 
embarked into an era of move-
ment activism, travelling with 
the Muslim Brotherhood, speak-
ing and proselytizing the organi-
zation’s mission.

Skovgaard-Petersen 
added 

that one of al-Qaradawi’s main 
teachings invoked Islam as a 
“simple” concept not meant to be 
overcomplicated and erroneously 
applied. 
Skovgaard-Petersen 

further noted that al-Qaradawi 
was known for his style of frank 
speech.

“That idea of making Islam 

simple … is something that he 
specializes 
in,” 
Skovgaard-

Petersen said. “He speaks not a 
very convoluted Arabic, gener-
ally. He knows how to communi-
cate.”

During the 1960s, Skovgaard-

Petersen 
said, 
al-Qaradawi 

moved into a period of “institu-
tional activism” when he strayed 
away from his involvement in 
Muslim Brotherhood after the 
organization was banned in 
Egypt. During this period, al-
Qaradawi also did not take severe 
public stances on political issues.

During 
this 
era, 
accord-

ing to Skovgaard-Petersen, al-
Qaradawi declined to become 
the leader of the Muslim Broth-
erhood when offered the role — 
instead taking on a paternal role 
in influencing Muslim youth to 
steer them on the right path.

“We have new generations 

of Muslims who are much more 
devout than we have seen before, 
but they are also much more 
prone to error, and they need the 
guidance of men like him,” he 
said.

Skovgaard-Petersen said al-

Qaradawi, moving into the 1970s, 
became involved with issues of 
Islamic finance and medicine 
through “solutionist activism,” 
wherein Islam could be viewed 
as a “solution” to political issues. 
This period of time is also known 
as the Islamic revival of the 1970s.

Skovgaard-Petersen said al-

Qaradawi was a well-known fig-
ure by 1990, and had acquired a 
large global following. Despite 
a language barrier, al-Qaradawi 
joined the European Council 
for Fatwah and Research and 
began to develop an interest in 

how Muslims should survive in 
Europe and the West.

Though seemingly quite sud-

den, 
al-Qaradawi 
became 
a 

“national mediator of some sig-
nificance,” 
Skovgaard-Petersen 

said.

Eventually, 
al-Qaradawi 

defended parliamentary democ-
racy as an Islamically correct 
form of governance.

Al-Qaradawi 
is 
still 
con-

cerned with Jihadism today, and 
addressed his rebuttal of Jihadist 
thinkers in one of his books.

“He 
is 
becoming 
inspir-

ing 
and 
sometimes 
pushing 

Islamic movements to move in 
a more democratic direction,” 
Skovgaard-Petersen said.

Skovgaard-Petersen 
argued 

that the Arab revolutions, the for-
mation of the Freedom and Jus-

tice Party in Egypt and the party’s 
2012 electoral victory marked the 
climax of al-Qaradawi’s influence 
over the Islamist movement. That 
said, Skovgaard-Petersen noted 
that al-Qaradawi remains a con-
troversial figure in contemporary 
politics.

“Many of his statements are 

probably more controversial in 
Western context than they are 
in a Middle Eastern context,” 
Skovgaard-Petersen said. “In the 
Middle East, he would hardly be 
considered an extremist.”

Now 89 years old, al-Qaradawi 

considers himself an activist and 
is not yet a “spent force,” accord-
ing to Skovgaard-Petersen. “It is 
very difficult to see who will fill 
his shoes the day when he dies.”

Skovgaard-Petersen said he 

did not lecture to pass a moral 

judgment of al-Qaradawi, but 
rather to make an assessment 
of 
his 
political 
significance. 

Skovgaard-Petersen said he uses 
al-Qaradawi’s unfinished mem-
oirs, as well as numerous books 
written by al-Qaradawi’s own 
students and colleagues, to col-
lect information on the Muslim 
activist.

Al-Qaradawi was sentenced 

to death in June of this year in 
Egypt, but continues to update 
social media, tweeting about 
events as current as the Egyptian 
elections earlier this month.

Nevertheless, 
Skovgaard-

Petersen 
said, 
al-Qaradawi 

continues to make lasting contri-
butions to contemporary Islamic 
and political thinking.

UM-Dearborn 
launches general 
education program

University 
of 
Michigan-

Dearborn officials launched the 
school’s first general education 
program last week in an effort 
to better prepare students to 
succeed throughout college and 
life. 

The 
program, 
Dearborn 

Discovery Core, requires students 
to take upper and lower- level 
courses in one of three categories: 
Foundational Studies, Areas of 
Inquiry or Capstone Experiences. 

Foundational Studies consists 

of 
courses 
that 
strengthen 

students’ communication, critical 
and quantitative thinking and 
problem solving skills. Areas of 
Inquiry covers classes in natural 
resources, social and behavioral 
analysis, arts and humanities. 
Capstone 
Experiences 
are 

courses providing students with 
the chance to reflect on previous 
learning experiences. 

 

Ilitch family gifts 
$40 million to 
Wayne State 

The Ilitch family will donate 

land and funds totalling $40 
million for a new business school 
to be located near downtown 
Detroit, the Detroit Free Press 
reported. This gift marks the 
largest gift in Wayne State’s 
history. 

Mike Ilitch, an American 

entrepreneur 
famous 
for 

founding Little Caesar’s Pizza, 
is also owner of the Detroit Red 
Wings and the Detroit Tigers. 

The donation includes $35 

million to build the school, 
located near the new Red Wings 
arena on Woodward Avenue, 
in addition to a $5 million 
endowment. 

Construction is expected to be 

complete in 2018. The school will 
be named the Mike Illitch School 
of Business. 

Two Detroit police 
officers charged 
with misconduct

Two Detroit police officers, 

Charles Lynem, age 32, and 
Chancellor Searcy, age 29, plead-
ed not guilty Tuesday before the 
36th District Magistrate Laura 
Echartea to charges includ-
ing confiscating money from a 
33-year-old man they arrested 
in March 2013. They were addi-
tionally charged for fabricating 
“circumstances and documenta-
tion” associated with the arrest 
of a 41-year-old man in Septem-
ber 2014. 

Lynem and Searcy are both 

seven-year 
veterans 
of 
the 

Detroit Police Department. They 
are both currently suspended 
without pay and face several 
counts, including misconduct 
in office, embezzlement of less 
than $20,000 and false report of 
felony. 

Attorney 
John 
Goldpaugh 

is representing the two men in 
court and said he expects they 
will be exonerated. 

“They’re both hard-working 

people that have been out there 
serving Detroit,” he said. “And 
serving Detroit well.”

Regional Studies, discusses Yusuf al-Qaradawi and the establishment of the Freedom and Justice Party in Egypt in 
the School of Social Work on Tuesday.

to students in print form before 
the 
transition 
to 
electronic 

feedback.

LSA junior Sean Pitt, CSG 

chief of staff, said releasing 
course evaluation data will allow 
students to form expectations 
of courses without resorting 
to third-party sources like the 
website RateMyProfessors.com.

“We 
have 
all 
this 
data 

collected 
about 
previous 

students’ experiences,” Pitt said, 
“Our goal is to make it easier for 
them to make decisions based on 
their peers.”

CSG 
President 
Cooper 

Charlton, an LSA senior, said 
the immediate release of course 
evaluations is not the only 
ongoing conversation between 
CSG and faculty governance.

“The 
second 
conversation 

is about a continued shared 
collaboration with faculty to 
make sure the instrument of 
gathering course evaluations 
is not only accurate, but it’s 
efficient 
to 
give 
us 
some 

substantial feedback,” Charlton 
said.

In this case, “instrument” 

refers to how the evaluations 
are 
designed. 
Comparative 

Literature 
Prof. 
Silke-Maria 

Weineck, 
who 
chairs 
the 

Senate Advisory Committee on 
University Affairs, has said the 
current instrument negatively 
affects the quality of data 
yielded.

“In my 17 years at the 

University of Michigan, I have 
not heard from a single person 
that thinks this is a good 
instrument providing good data,” 
she said at an Oct. 12 SACUA 
meeting. “In sum, nobody thinks 
that these are good data. And 
whatever they are, they were 
not designed to assist students 
in choosing classes; it is the 
wrong instrument for that. So 
what we’ve been saying at the 
Senate Assembly, it’s not that we 
don’t think students don’t have 
a legitimate interest in having 
more and better information on 
how to choose classes, but we 
think at a world-class University 
it behooves us to design an 
instrument that can actually 
deliver the data needed for that 
purpose.”

Charlton said ideally, CSG 

wants to course evaluations to 
be released by Winter 2016.

Resolution updates

CSG Assembly also considered 

a new resolution Tuesday to 
support featuring information 
about University mental health 
services 
in 
course 
syllabi 

distributed at the beginning of 
each semester.

LSA junior David Schafer, who 

co-authored the resolution, said 
inspiration for the resolution 
came from the recent emphasis 
raising awareness about sexual 
assault prevention on campus. 
The University’s Sexual Assault 
Prevention 
and 
Awareness 

Center added language about 
Title IX and sexual assault 
awareness to course syllabi this 
semester.

“I thought that was a fantastic 

idea,” Schafer said.

Schafer said the resolution 

will aim to spread the message 
that there is a direct correlation 
between mental health and 
academic results — as well as 
inform incoming students who 
may be unaware of the services 
available to them.

“No student should come to 

the University of Michigan and 
be shut off to these resources 
because they don’t know these 
resources exist,” Schafer said.

Public Policy junior Gabe 

Dell, 
who 
co-authored 
the 

resolution, said these resources 
are not currently being utilized 
to their full capacity.

Schafer said to approach the 

resolution as professionally as 
possible, CSG went through key 
departments on campus devoted 
to mental health assistance. 
He added that the resolution 
has 
garnered 
support 
from 

Robert Winfield, the director 
of University Health Services 
and 
the 
University’s 
chief 

health officer, and Todd Sevig, 
the director of Counseling and 
Psychological Services.

LSA junior Sierra Stone, a 

representative on the Assembly, 
said 
the 
resolution 
is 
the 

culmination of many meetings 
with both Sevig and Winfield.

“This isn’t something that 

we just threw together; this 
is something we’re all really 
passionate about,” Stone said.

Schafer 
said 
the 
policy 

recommended by this resolution 
is not groundbreaking, adding 
that the inclusion of campus 
resources and the advocacy of 
proper language, particularly 
in the case of sexual assault 
by example, has already been 
implemented at schools like 
Columbia University, Rutgers 
University and the University of 
Minnesota.

Schafer said the potential 

mental 
health 
resources 

outlined on syllabi would not 
necessarily be exhaustive. He 
added that the resources listed 
would prominently include but 
not be limited to UHS and CAPS, 
among others.

Should 
the 
resolution 
be 

approved 
by 
the 
Assembly, 

Schafer, 
Stone 
and 
Dell 

would 
approach 
University 

Provost Martha Pollack with 
their recommendation for its 
adoption.

“S

ports are stupid.”

Michigan’s loss that day to 

Michigan State 

was already enough, but 
as I sat in that bar watch-
ing the Mets score another 
run against my beloved 
Cubs in the first game of the 
National League Champi-
onship Series, “sports are 
stupid” was the only logical 
conclusion and the only set 
of words I could conjure. 
In retrospect, trying to 
get over that crazy loss by 
watching the most pitiful 
professional sports team in 
the past century was probably a poor decision.

I was with a Spartan friend of mine from 

childhood who was visiting and is also a Cubs 
fan, so we figured going out to watch the Cubs 
would hopefully be a more enjoyable end to 
the day for both of us.

“Remember a couple years ago where you 

came to East Lansing for the game with me 
and just walked out after Gardner threw a 
pick at the end?” he asked me.

Of course I remem-

bered. I had snuck into 
MSU’s student section 
with him, and in the 
wind and freezing rain, 
watched as the Spartans 
absolutely 
demolished 

the Wolverines. At some 
point in the fourth quar-
ter, with Michigan’s com-
puter-calculated chance 
of winning the game 
probably somewhere in 
the negatives, the interception happened, and 
I just got up and left. I had no idea where I 
was going.

“I thought I’d never see you more dejected 

at a sports game then you were then. Guess I 
was wrong.”

Yeah, guess you were wrong, I told him. 

I’d rather watch that game in East Lansing 
a thousand times than what we had just wit-
nessed.

At this point, Matt Harvey was dominating 

the Cubs and sports were only getting more 
stupid.

“At least I’ve got the Lions to look forward 

to tomorrow,” I said. It’s a joke. It’s the Lions 
— of course it’s a joke.

My dad texted me that night, “I was at the 

Kordell game when we lost,” he said, refer-
ring to when quarterback Kordell Stewart 
threw a 64-yard Hail Mary as time expired to 
lift Colorado to a win in the Big House. “This 
game was way worse.”

It’s a common thing, sports heartbreak. 

I guess when you’re a fan of the Lions and 
your dad raises you to be a Cubs fan like he 
was growing up, you’ve kind of signed up for 
the anguish. When my dad was at the Univer-
sity in 1984, the Cubs, who had a phenomenal 
team that year, choked against the Padres in 
the National League Championship Series. So 
to poke fun at his sports grief, his friends in 
Mary Markley Hall decided to take all of his 
Cubs gear and dress up as a ghost. “The Ghost 
of the Cubs,” they called it. Sports were stu-
pid then, too.

No matter how many times it happens, 

no matter how many different times and 
different ways the team loses, you still come 
back for some reason.

The year after that time I walked out of 

Spartan Stadium I showed up there again. 
One hundred thousand-plus will still show 
up in a couple weeks at the Big House. It’s 
not Stockholm Syndrome or that we haven’t 
learned the pitfalls of being emotionally 
invested in a game. It’s not just the inevi-
table hope of winning that may or may not 
come that draws fans back. People show up to 
sports games not just to feel the happiness or 

sadness but instead just 
to feel anything at all.

There 
was 
a 

commercial a few years 
back, in which the Cubs 
win the World Series 
and fans celebrate in the 
streets. It’s the dream 
of every Cubs fan. And 
then slowly the camera 
zooms out from the 
TV screen, and a guy 
holding his PlayStation 

3 controller, a tear rolling down his cheek as 
he witnesses the video game World Series 
champions. Sports aren’t real; from the 
perspective of a fan, they’re nothing more 
than entertainment. Yet in every form, real 
or not, there’s something enthralling that has 
made sports the integral part of society it is.

There’s something hauntingly beautiful 

about that football game on Saturday. In the 
same place, there were one hundred thou-
sand fans standing in stunned silence, and 
thousands more erupting in cheers. There 
were tears of all kinds, smiles, hugs and 
dejected exits. It’s not the image of the game 
that will stick with me forever, but the image 
of the reactions of 110,000 fans each feeling 
something.

Something in response to nothing more 

than a stupid game of sports.

Normalizing racism

Monday 
 
 
 
night, 
#AssaultatSpringValleyHigh 

began trending on Twitter when a video 
surfaced that depicted Deputy Ben Fields 
of Richland County, S.C., dragging a Black 
female student from her desk, throwing her 
to the gournd and subsequently arresting her.

This 
sequence 
of 
shocking 
events 

prompted the usual rhetoric from both sides: 
Many people were outraged by the officer’s 
aggression, while others questioned his 
motives, as if something this student had done 
or said could somehow justify the excessive 
use of force. I’m outraged by the video. I’m 
horrified and saddened and speechless — 
but what sickens me most is how used to it I 
 

have become. 

In the last few years in particular, I 

have watched so many similar incidents 
draw national attention before gradually 
subsiding in the face of a newer, more 
gripping tragedy. Names, faces and stories 
have grown increasingly muddled and vague 
over time. A man, woman, child, student, 
veteran, disabled person, homeless man was 
shot, stabbed, assaulted, ambushed, belittled 
by a police officer, store owner, teacher, 
neighbor, sociopath.

National headlines have become a disturb-

ing game of fill in the blank. 

We have become accustomed to the tearful 

speeches delivered by the victims’ families, 
the old photographs, the funeral scenes. Our 
reality has become a segment on the evening 
news, a Facebook post, a hashtag, a brief and 
ardent discussion at the dinner table. People 

are suffering and we are so accustomed to it 
now. The spectacle of adversity is the New 
American Normal.

But how many times can we go through 

the motions — astonishment, rage, sadness, 
hopelessness — before it becomes clear to us 
that stories like this one are not just another 
mundane cycle of news? That they are not 
trends? That they are people who were here 
one day and gone the next because someone 
in a position of power refused to deem them 
worthy of respect, or because a prejudiced 
murderer carried out a twisted plan of racial 
vengeance or because we took no preventative 
measures whatsoever to ensure their safety? 

Our outrage should be consistent. We 

should remember the names of those we 
have lost and take active steps to obstruct 
the emergence of future victims. We 
shouldn’t treat this national predicament 
like we treat other publicized disasters, only 
becoming invested when the story is relevant 
and allowing ourselves to forget after the 
conversation is over. We need to keep the 
dialogue going; we cannot let ourselves 
become desensitized to blatant injustice, to 
prejudice, to murder. 

This is my call to action: Do not allow your-

self to forget, because even as the relevance 
of the story wanes in the media, its impact is 
still very real and profound.

These are people we are talking about, 

after all.

I

t’s never fun being the third 
wheel, as Democratic can-
didate Martin O’Malley will 

soon learn. Dem-
ocratic presiden-
tial 
candidates 

have been drop-
ping 
like 
flies 

in the month of 
October, as for-
mer 
senators 

Jim Webb and 
Lincoln Chafee 
bowed out with-
in days of one 
another. 
Vice 

President 
Joe 

Biden has ruled 
out the possibility of running and 
so the field is set: a huge group that 
is ready for Hillary, a sizable con-
tingent feeling the Bern, and a gui-
tar-playing former governor with 
relatively low name recognition.

This past Friday, I had the 

pleasure of attending an event 
sponsored by the Arab American 
Institute at the University of Mich-
igan-Dearborn, which provided a 
platform for discussion about the 
Syrian refugee crisis and culmi-
nated with a speech by O’Malley. 
About halfway through his speech, 
a familiar iPhone ringtone rang out 
on one side of the auditorium. As its 
owner hurried quickly out the door, 
the governor joked, “I told Hillary 
never to call me here!”

Laughter filled the room, but all I 

could think of was how sadly unre-
alistic the premise was. Why would 
Clinton pay any attention at all to a 
candidate who is polling at nearly 
one-fiftieth her support?

On paper, O’Malley should be 

a dream candidate for liberal pri-
mary voters: As governor, he led a 
campaign to legalize same-sex mar-
riage in Maryland. On immigra-
tion, he implemented the DREAM 
Act before it was even passed on 
the federal level. During his ten-
ure, Maryland repealed the death 
penalty, passed one of the toughest 
firearm laws in the nation, raised 
the minimum wage to $10.10 and 
decriminalized possession of small 
amounts of marijuana. As he spoke 
about foreign policy, welcoming 
the promised 65,000 refugees and 
the current situation in the Middle 
East, I — as a liberal — did not dis-

agree with him at any point.

So why can I not get excited 

about O’Malley? 

Based on the attendance in Dear-

born, I know that I’m not alone in 
this respect. The auditorium was 
not that large to start with, and 
there were plenty of empty seats — 
not exactly the attendance numbers 
you want if you’re running for pres-
ident. As his speech progressed, 
the silences were littered with 
awkward applause and there never 
seemed to be a crescendo. Hav-
ing heard Clinton speak in person, 
I could feel the electricity and the 
magnitude of her words, her name 
and her office. Listening to Sand-
ers call for a political revolution 
in his thick Brooklyn accent and 
watching his upper body gesticu-
late wildly, it’s difficult not to be the 
least bit enthused at the prospect 
of an indepen-
dent senator as 
president. Yet, 
with O’Malley, 
no one seems 
to be on the 
other end of 
that 
enthusi-

asm.

His situation 

looks even less 
favorable when 
you 
consider 

how 
many 

opportunities have come and gone 
for him to stand out. In the first 
Democratic debate, his performance 
was the least memorable, paling in 
comparison to Chafee’s bungled 
answer on Glass-Steagall, Webb 
whining for more speaking time and 
the now-famous Sanders quote about 
Clinton’s “damn e-mails.” Reports 
from the all-important Jefferson 
Jackson dinner in Iowa — a huge 
gathering of Democratic supporters 
and fundraisers — have O’Malley 
garnering mild support but lacking 
the roaring ovations that welcomed 
the two frontrunners.

What begins now for O’Malley is 

a long test for his staff and his wal-
let. There’s an old saying in politics 
that there are only three tickets out 
of the Iowa primary. Based on how 
the Democratic field looks now, one 
of those belongs to O’Malley — if 
his fundraising efforts stay steady 
(or at least afloat, unlike the Perry 

campaign). Why, though, would he 
carry on like this?

Many pundits have posited that 

the goal is to be Clinton’s vice presi-
dential nominee, and not without 
reason. Another explanation may 
be that if Clinton’s troubling num-
bers in terms of trust, warmth and 
overall favorability or Sanders’ 
uncompromising defense of demo-
cratic socialism are enough to sink 
them, O’Malley will be the logical 
life vest of the Democrats’ hopes 
for 2016.

The true nature of this campaign 

will be clarified, and potentially 
decided, next Friday night at the 
second Democratic debate. Presi-
dential campaigns have had late 
starts in the past. Bill Clinton did 
not announce his candidacy until 
October 1991, and at this point in 
1976, Jimmy Carter was one of 13 

candidates 
in 

a 
Democratic 

field 
without 

a 
frontrun-

ner. But this 
would be about 
as late a rise 
into relevance 
as 
histori-

cal 
precedent 

would allow.

One 
quote 

stood out dur-
ing the gov-

ernor’s speech at Dearborn: “The 
difference between a dream and a 
goal is a deadline.”

On behalf of the liberal base, 

going into 2016, I would like to put 
forth a deadline to the O’Malley 
campaign: Nov. 6, the day of the 
second debate. There needs to be 
a moment, like Clinton on Arsenio 
Hall or the introduction of “Yes We 
Can” in 2008. Voters need to see 
the X-factor, the liberal qualifica-
tions, the demographic that can be 
reached that separates O’Malley 
from the pack. Show me why I 
should look past Bernie and Hillary.

Look for that moment (because 

I think the O’Malley campaign 
knows this to be true), or look for 
the Democratic race to be a one-on-
one footrace in Iowa starting in the 
new year.

Why would Clinton

polling at nearly one-
fiftieth her support?

O’Slim chance

W

hen I was in elementary 
school, I would get the 
most terrible nosebleeds. 

Not the kind that 
went away quick-
ly, but the kind 
that would put 
me in the nurse’s 
office with my 
head tipped back, 
pinching 
my 

nose for an hour. 
While I would sit 
there, my neck 
getting sore from 
looking up for 
so long, I would 
look at the food pyramid poster that 
was just above and to the right of her 
desk across the room. It had a black 
background with the classic cartoon 
images of bread, rice and grains on 
the bottom and ice cream and snack 
food on the top. To the left of her desk 
was a door with another poster on it; 
bottles of soda were lined up with 
mounds of refined sugar in front 
of them, designed to scare viewers 
away from the beverages. I was in 
second grade, and a mound of sugar 
didn’t look half bad.

These images are just two of the 

many pieces of propaganda that 
detail the government-approved 
answer to an impossible question: 
“What should we eat?”

Every five years, the U.S. Depart-

ment of Health and Human Services 
and the U.S. Department of Agricul-
ture publish the Dietary Guidelines 
for Americans, which are based 
on the latest and greatest scientific 
research. These guidelines not only 
promote specific dietary habits for 
individuals, but also serve as the 
foundations of nutrition programs 
ranging from national policies to the 
posters in a small nurse’s office in 
Shelburne, Vt.

The problem is that nutritional 

guidelines tend to act a little more 
like the game of “telephone” than 
an instruction manual. Every once 
in a while, a guideline is blown 

out of proportion and causes 
unintended outcomes.

One 
example 
is 
cholesterol. 

People nearly stopped eating eggs 
and red meat due to the impression 
that consuming dietary cholesterol 
directly caused an increase in blood 
cholesterol levels. Cholesterol in 
the body is infinitely more compli-
cated than such a linear pathway, 
and this myth has been (thankful-
ly) debunked, so put an egg on your 
burger and dig in. 

More problematic is how the 

concept 
of 
a 

“low-fat 
diet” 

continues to be 
lost in transla-
tion. For years, 
the 
guidelines 

have instructed 
Americans 
to 

choose 
lean 

meats 
and 

reduce 
con-

sumption 
of 

fats. But just 
as the game of 
telephone goes, this innocent advice 
has turned into a different beast all 
together. The concept of “low-fat” 
has become nearly synonymous with 
“all-carb,” and people can’t seem to 
let it go. It seems to be common sense 
that eating fat will make you fat.

Even Regina George says, “I 

can’t go to Taco Bell. I’m on an all-
carb diet,” and when has “Mean 
Girls” ever steered us wrong? 
The words “fat free” are every-
where, plastered on billboards and 
 

menus alike.

What isn’t spelled out as clearly, 

however, is what is taking the place 
of these fats. By avoiding fats, peo-
ple instead turn to what Jane Brody 
of The New York Times calls “two 
kinds of carbohydrates, refined 
starches and sugars.”

Brody goes on to claim that these 

carbohydrates “have helped to spawn 
the current epidemic of obesity and 
Type 2 diabetes.” In her article, 
Brody identifies that like cholesterol, 

not all fats and carbohydrates are 
created equal. The saturated animal-
based fats can be harmful if eaten in 
great quantity, but unsaturated fats 
such as olive oil actually benefit car-
diovascular health.

As Frank B. Hu, a professor at the 

Harvard T. H. Chan School of Pub-
lic Health, said in Brody’s article, 
“We have to get out of the fat phobia 
mind-set.”

Similarly, simple and complex 

carbs can be good for you, with 
the main exception being refined 

carbohydrates. 
Refined carbs 
are 
“rapidly 

digested 
and 

absorbed” due 
to the absence 
of 
fiber. 

According 
to 

Brody, excess 
consumption 
of these carbs 
“can 
result 

in 
insulin 

resistance and 

contribute to fatty liver disease.”

The importance of reducing rates 

of cardiovascular disease in the 
United States cannot be overstat-
ed. In 2006, the estimated health 
care cost of cardiovascular disease 
amounted to $403 billion and 26.6 
million adults are currently diag-
nosed with heart disease, making 
it the No. 1 cause of death in the 
United States. Dietary choices are 
one factor, but when other factors 
such as sedentary lifestyle are con-
sidered, the effects become much 
more prominent. In regard to the fat 
versus carbohydrate discussion, as 
Brody puts it, past guidelines “have 
caused the pendulum to swing too 
far in the wrong direction.”

All-carb diets are a bust. Not that 

I’m advocating for Taco Bell as a 
healthy option, but maybe Regina 
George wasn’t right after all.

Breaking gender 
roles in ‘Caesar’

Shakespeare classic 
comes to Ann Arbor 

Civic Theatre

By BAILEY KADIAN

Daily Arts Writer

A conspiracy to kill the lead-

er of Rome by stabbing him 
33 times involves deceit, vio-
lence 
and 

a 
power-

ful pursuit 
towards 
reforming 
the 
state. 

It involves 
blood-
shed 
by 

the 
hands 

of 
those 

who crave 
political 
change. 
Next week, 
the 
Ann 

Arbor Civic 
Theatre 
presents 
Julius Cae-
sar, a writ-
ten account 
of 
Roman 

history and one of Shake-
speare’s greatest tragedies.

“Is there ever any reason that 

justifies murder? That’s what 
we’re asking and it’s exciting to 
see everyone take that so seri-
ously,” said director Kate Walsh 
in an interview with The Michi-
gan Daily.

Julius Caesar marks Walsh’s 

sixth show with the organization.

“The actors, designers, pro-

duction staff — everyone wants 
to do service to this story,” Walsh 
said. “I’m really excited about the 
commitment of the people in this 
process and the level of expertise 
that we are able to access.”

A2CT has been able to use 

expertise from numerous sourc-
es for this production. Profes-
sionals such as set designer 
Nathan Doud and music design-
er Katie Van Dusen, a School of 
Music, Theatre & Dance alum. 
The team has brought in Prof. 
Rob Najarian from SMTD to 
teach combat. These designers 
continue to enhance the pro-
duction through loaning their 
time and expertise to the devel-
opment of the story. 

“Julius Caesar” requires a 

cast able to address the dif-
ficulty of Shakespearean lan-
guage as well as the thematic 
complexity beneath. They must 
focus on making the language 
understandable to an audience.

“When you hear it done by 

people who love the language 
and know it really well, it comes 
to life, and you’re like, ‘This is 
amazing,’” Walsh said.

The play opens with Caesar, 

returning home from the Fol-
lowing. Caesar is warned to 
“Beware the Ides of March,” or 
March 15, which he disregards. 
Cassius, a leading conspirator of 
the assassination of Caesar, con-
vinces Brutus to join the cause. 
Bloodshed and defeat follow, as 
battle for “the sake of Rome” is 
balanced with an equally strong 
pursuit for power.

The technical design for this 

show draws inspiration from 
the language of the text, rather 
than from the violence and dark-
ness that the plot provides. Most 
actors are onstage for the entire-
ty of the show, playing multiple 
roles with simple costume chang-
es, which allows the plot to speak 
for itself.

“It’s very violent, but the lan-

guage doesn’t match what they’re 
doing,” Walsh said. “I wanted 
something that was going to be 
a sharp contrast, a brutal, violent 
contrast to the logic that comes 
with the language.”

But the contrast goes beyond 

language and violence.

“One of the challenges, being 

a female director, and being a 
female in theatre, is that there 
aren’t a lot of opportunities avail-
able, especially for actors,” Walsh 
said. “We have an opportunity to 
do something different.”

Walsh has created something 

new: A reversal with women 
playing some of the leading male 
roles in the show. In one instance, 
Kaela Parnicky, a veteran of 
A2CT, plays Antony.

“It’s a really different role for 

me personally. I think it’s very 
against type,” Parnicky said. 
“Not only because I’m female, 
but also because I’m very small 
and a soprano.”

Through describing changes 

in her mindset, and getting 
used to the challenges that this 
role calls for, Parnicky credits 
Walsh for creating an environ-
ment that allows her to thrive, 
despite the challenge.

“This is my third show with 

Kat, and I do it because it’s an 
ensemble experience,” Parnicky 
said. “I love the emphasis on 
everyone working together.”

The 
subversion 
of 
gender 

roles and type changes expecta-
tions and according to Walsh, is 
very positive toward each actor’s 
growth.

“It’s not going to be what’s 

expected but that’s exciting,” 
Walsh said. “Sometimes we can 
learn something new from that 
character because these people 
are approaching it in that way.”

Through a difficult text, a vio-

lent story and a talented cast and 
crew, A2CT will try to do justice 
to this Shakespearean classic.

“My hope is that no one even 

notices, that it’s not even some-
thing that is thought of, because 
they go so much into the char-
acters, you are so enwrapped 
in the story. That’s hard to do. 
The actors just want to push the 
story forward.”

‘Killer of Sheep’ a 
little known classic

By REBECCA LERNER

Daily Arts Writer

You probably haven’t heard 

of the film “Killer of Sheep.” 
Contrary to first impressions 
of its horror-esque title, the 
film 
is 
about 
an 
African-

American family in the 1970s 
in Watts, one of the poorest 
neighborhoods in Los Angeles. 
It’s regarded as one of the best 
movies in film history, selected 
for preservation in the United 
States National Film Registry 
by the Library of Congress and 
chosen by the National Society 
of Film Critics as one of the 
100 Essential Films. Despite 
the high praise garnered from 
almost all of its critics, “Killer 
of Sheep” lies dead in its 
obscurity. 

 Directed by Charles Burnett 

in 1977 as his senior thesis from 
UCLA’s 
School 
of 
Theatre, 

Film and Television, “Killer of 

Sheep” soon became a classic 
among 
the 
academic 
elite. 

Burnett made “Killer of Sheep” 
on a minuscule budget of about 
$10,000 and used his friends 
and family for actors. The film’s 
academic reputation, despite its 
humble beginning, was due to 
the somewhat reticent nature 
of the release — Burnett only 
showed his film in colleges, 
museums and churches during 
the first release. 

 “Killer of Sheep” wasn’t 

always a classic. Janet Maslin 
of The New York Times gave 
the film its first review and 
criticized 
the 
very 
aspects 

later exalted by critics. She 
called 
it 
uneventful 
and 

chastised 
Burnett’s 
use 
of 

non-professional 
actors 
who 

mumble or overact some of their 
lines. 

 Upon first viewing “Killer 

of Sheep,” I would have agreed 
with Maslin. The film is about 

two hours long but without any 
extensive or complex storyline. 
The plot follows Stan, a black 
man trying to take care of his 
family and fit into the mold of 
masculinity forced upon him 
by the culture of Watts. The 
black and white episodic takes 
of Stan and his family can be 
boring as we watch them walk 
around the neighborhood, cook 
and struggle through daily 
life. Stan’s day job provides the 
origin of the title, as his work 
is the methodical butchering 
of 
strung-up 
sheep 
in 
a 

slaughterhouse.

 However, when I further 

researched Burnett and his 
motivations 
behind 
“Killer 

of Sheep,” I realized the full 
value of the film. Burnett was 
part of a cohort of filmmakers 
responding to the Blaxploitation 
film movement of the ’70s, 
where Black actors were used 
as a crutch to promote Black 

‘Winter’ a successful 
Netflix original doc

By KARL WILLIAMS

Online Arts Editor

“Winter on Fire: Ukraine’s Fight 

for Freedom” opens with a young 
man surrounded by the sounds 
of 
bullets 

and 
shouts 

of 
civilians: 

“This is the 
Ukrainian 
Revolution 
… I was just 
dragging 
a 

dead 
body. 

I stepped in 
blood. 
You 

can’t surprise 
me with any-
thing,” 
he 

says.

It’s 
win-

ter 
2013. 

We’re 
in 

Kiev, Ukraine under the regime 
of Pro-Russian President Vik-
tor Yanukovych, a man whose 
previous run for the presidency 
in 2004 was fraught with allega-
tions of corruption and embat-
tled by protests known as the 
Orange Revolution. The country, 
once again, became enmeshed 
in a geopolitical tug-of-war 
between Western Europe and 
Russia. Yanukovych promises 
alignment with the European 
Union publicly, but privately, he 
organizes a deal with Russia.

Outraged 
by 
Yanukovych’s 

secret political dealings, citizens 
organize a protest at Maidan 
Square in Kiev. Like the Arab 
Spring and similar public pro-
tests, many of the thousands 
at 
Maidan 
became 
involved 

through social media. Many 
of them, moreover, are apoliti-
cal — they’re ordinary citizens. 
They chant, “Ukraine is part of 
Europe!” For the first time since 
the invasion of the Tatars in the 
12th Century, every single bell of 
St. Michael’s Monastery rang.

What’s most remarkable about 

“Winter on Fire” is how it was 
shot. The film consists mostly of 
footage from inside the protests, 
putting you right inside the action. 
We see men and women beaten 
with shocking immediacy. At one 
point, a man, bending down to put 
one of the scores of wounded onto 
a stretcher, is shot on camera. 
The film attests to the courage of 
the citizens fighting for freedom 
and, also, to the filmmakers who 
risked their lives shooting it.

After the protests began, Kiev 

became a warzone. Protesters 
created barricades to defend 
themselves against the Berkut. 
They 
used 
makeshift 
muni-

tions: they made shields from 
the material at hand, used rocks 
and bricks as weapons and wore 
kitchen pots for helmets.

Over the 93 days of protest, 

spanning from early November 
through Feb. 22, the police force 
used against Ukrainian citizens 
— accompanied by hired merce-
naries —escalated from full-scale 
beatings to murder: 125 people 
were killed; 65 remain missing; 
1,890 were treated for injuries.

“Winter on Fire” locates its 

drama in the plight of these ordi-
nary citizens turned protesters. It’s 
less concerned with the nuances of 
geopolitics than the abuse of power 
and fight for human dignity. It’s not a 
documentary that merely exposes — 
it advocates. It’s wholly and explic-
itly one-sided, an unofficial, oral 
history of the citizens who fought 
and survived the battles in Kiev. The 
singularity of its political viewpoint 
is its triumph, but it falters in failing 
to establish the political conditions 
in which the citizens fought. The 
film calls for humanitarian democ-
racy, for civil rights and for freedom 
in the face of totalitarianism, but it 
fails to really carve out the face of 
this particular totalitarianism.

While “Winter on Fire” suf-

fers slightly from its failure to 
adequately provide its politi-
cal context, the film remains 
an exceptional and compelling 
documentary. It’s a visual and 
oral history of the Ukrainian 
citizens’ incredible bravery, and 
it’s a well-crafted reminder that 
the unity of citizens can result in 
political change.

You can tell why this movie is so famous.

stereotypes. “Killer of Sheep” 
exists as a reverberation of that 
misrepresentation, 
because 

Stan and his family are not as 
riveting as the Black stereotypes 
perpetuated by other films of 
the time — they’re fully realized 
characters 
with 
flaws 
and 

dreams that cannot be achieved 
because of their circumstances. 
Burnett did not create his 
characters to entertain, but to 
inform in a time period where 
emotional material like this was 
lacking. 

 
Burnett 
was 
entirely 

disinterested 
in 
Hollywood 

and the mainstream media, 
as they were the perpetrators 
of Black stereotypes against 
which he fought. As he stated 
in 
an 
interview 
with 
The 

Boston Globe in 1979, “I can’t 
see my films being produced by 
Hollywood … My films are not 
entertaining. They don’t appeal 
to a wide audience. They’re 
limited to an audience that has 
serious concerns.” 

 So maybe Burnett never 

wanted recognition for “Killer 
of Sheep.” People have tried 
to raise awareness for it with 
accolades and a rerelease of the 
film in 2007 after legal issues 
with its soundtrack were worked 
out, but maybe that isn’t what 
Burnett wanted. He’s described 
as the lone wolf of cinema, doing 
his own thing. Maybe “Killer 
of Sheep” is exactly where it 
was always supposed to be —

Why Chris Brown 
is still the worst

MUSIC NOTEBOOK

Five reasons why 
Chris Brown is bad 

for pop culture

By CARLY SNIDER

Daily Arts Writer

1. He beat a woman.

Who the fuck does that? How 

is one so incapable of using words 
to solve problems that there is 
no other option but to resort to 
barbaric violence? I would like 
to think that most decent people 
could recognize domestic vio-
lence as the heinous, inexcusable 
crime that it is. But Chris Brown 
has failed do that, and neither 
can the portion of the American 
public who continue to support 
his career.

2. He promotes misogyny 
and objectification in his 

music.

Brown’s story would be entire-

ly different had he changed his 
image 
post-domestic-violence 

incident and used his fame to 
help women who have fallen vic-
tim to the kind of crime that he 
had committed. But, he didn’t 
do that. He continues to depict 
women as nothing more than 
sexual objects for consumption, 
further promoting the sexist 
culture in which male pop art-
ists thrive. For example, one of 
Brown’s most popular tracks, 
“Loyal,” includes some fun lyr-
ics like “I don’t fuck with broke 
bitches” and “Got a white girl 
with some fake titties.” So indic-
ative of equality and respect, 
right? Not to mention the song’s 
irony-soaked hook, “These hoes 
ain’t loyal.” Women are consid-
ered unfaithful whores just for 
talking to other guys, but Brown 
is still praised as an important 
pop culture figure despite his 
history of assault.

3. He has a tattoo of a bat-

tered woman on his neck.
After comparisons were made 

between Brown’s neck tattoo and 
the pictures taken of Rihanna 
at the hospital after her assault, 

Brown quickly tried to play the 
image off as a candy skull à la Dia 
de los Muertos. Either Brown has 
no idea what the Mexican skulls 
are supposed to look like or he 
went to the worst tattoo artist 
on the planet — the image looks 
nothing like the traditional geo-
metric, floral figures. If the image 
really is supposed to be that of 
an abused woman, Brown’s mis-
anthropic and violent identity is 
unquestionable. And if it really 
was supposed to be a candy skull, 
he should ask for his money back.

4. He beat a woman.
This needs to be mentioned 

again — there is no excuse for 
violence against women. This 
should be a career-ending act.

5. His continued success 

shows the patriarchal, misog-
ynistic tendencies that are 
deeply rooted in American cul-
ture.

There are many things that 

can end an artist’s career — sub-
stance abuse, sexual assault, 
money problems — but apparent-
ly a history of domestic violence 
is not one of them. If anything, 
Brown’s fame has grown since 
his infamous acts of 2009. It is 
not necessarily Brown’s success 
that peeves me so deeply, but 
its implications. Chris Brown is 
nothing unique; there are plenty 
of other up-and-coming artists 

who could take his place as the 
smooth hip-hop artist that he is 
— artists who have never physi-
cally assaulted another person. 
The fact that his act of unwar-
ranted violence against Rihan-
na did not bring his career to 
a close shows that sexism and 
patriarchal ideals are still alive 
and well in American culture. 
Record companies, radio sta-
tions and fellow artists (most 
surprisingly 
female 
artists, 

who perhaps need his co-sign 
to break into the mainstream) 
continue to work with Brown 
and promote his work. Estab-
lished artists like Rihanna and 
Nicki Minaj have worked with 
him on multiple occasions. Pia 
Mia and Jordin Sparks both col-
laborated with him in the early 
stages of their career, helping 
to launch them into the main-
stream. Obviously Brown is 
not the only artist to demean 
women through his music, but 
his violent past makes his doing 
so into a much stronger state-
ment — he has actually commit-
ted a wrong against women that 
his music suggests is acceptable. 
I know it’s improbable to think 
that sexism will be succinctly 
wiped out from pop culture, but 
cutting out an artist who is bla-
tantly misogynistic would be a 
step in the right direction.

The coat doubles as a trash bag.

Watching America 
through our TV set

By DANIELLE YACOBSON

Daily Arts Writer

“When 
I 
say 
‘America,’ 

what’s the first word that comes 
to mind?”

It’s a loaded question, and 

one 
that 
inevitably 
invites 

stereotypes. 
Maybe 
the 

political buzzwords pop into 
mind first: democracy, freedom, 
opportunity – “the American 
Dream” in all its infamous glory. 
But when Cut Video, a Seattle-
based YouTube channel, sent 
their producer around the world 
to ask this question, he received 
much more honest answers. 
Forget democracy – it’s the land 
of Hollywood, Britney Spears 
and Jersey Shore. In a video 
titled “America Around the 
World,” Cut Video illuminates 
the overwhelming impact that 
the TV and film industry has 
on perceptions of American 
life and culture. For better 
or for worse, the industry’s 
perpetuated stereotypes have 
influenced how the world views 
American families, careers and 
relationships, surfacing truths 
that may be hard to hear.

Cut Video, a channel that 

features 
individuals 
of 
all 

ages, 
genders, 
sizes 
and 

races, produces videos that 

predominantly 
explore 
hot-

button 
issues 
and 
cultural 

stigmas, such as transgender 
rights. Accumulating close to 
200 million views, the mini-
series has provided a platform 
for discussion as stereotyped 
groups are offered a voice 
to share their thoughts and 
experiences.

For the “Around the World” 

mini-series, 
the 
producer 

traveled across the globe to see 
what people think of America, 
collecting 
cliché 
descriptors 

that have engrained themselves 
into the U.S.’s cultural identity. 
Of the 11 individuals featured in 
the video, four think of food and 
obesity while nine circle around 
the American dream. “Is it a 
stereotype if it’s true?” a woman 
in Adelaide, Australia asked, 
as she called the American 
people “eternally optimistic.” 
Assigning a stereotype can 
make an abstract or complicated 
idea become more tangible, and 
when it comes to generalizing 
an entire country, the few labels 
that stick out are usually ones 
most prominently circulated. 
Not 
surprisingly, 
many 
of 

the video’s subjects point to 
the 
widespread 
influence 

of America’s television and 
entertainment industry. The 

chance of fame and success is 
not only gloriously portrayed 
in dramas and reality TV, 
but also off camera, as actors 
and 
actresses 
appear 
in 

advertisements 
and 
media 

campaigns all over the world. 
The pop-culture phenomena 
in 
the 
United 
States 
has 

transcended 
all 
borders, 

enhancing a specific and often 
misleading aspect of American 
life 
to 
those 
who 
haven’t 

experienced it themselves.

Global 
surveys 
have 

corroborated the impact of 
American TV culture, as the 
majority 
of 
European 
and 

Asian countries are reported 
to have positive perceptions 
of American music, TV and 
film. 
According 
to 
a 
2012 

survey collected by the PEW 
Research Center, ratings for 
American popular culture have 
continuously 
scored 
highly, 

with over 70 percent approval 
in Spain, Italy and France. 
Furthermore, 
results 
from 

a study conducted by GfK, 
a market-research firm that 
surveyed over 18,000 people 
across 18 countries, identified 
that 30 percent thought of 
American TV and film as the 
best aspect of American culture. 
By far the most popular answer, 
European 
countries 
alone 

attributed even higher marks, 
hovering around 40 percent.

Surprisingly, Americans had 

drastically 
different 
attitudes 

toward 
the 
effects 
of 
their 

television and popular culture 
than the rest of the world. The 
GfK survey identified a whopping 
32 percent of Americans attribute 
film and television as the worst 
contribution to world culture, 
higher than any other country, 
and by far the most popular 
response among all individuals 
surveyed. This is alarming: why 
are Americans so out of sync with 
the rest of the world’s perceptions?

Perhaps, the discrepancies 

within 
these 
statistics 

come 
from 
knowing 
the 

difference between real life 
and a glamorized distortion. 
From 
“Keeping 
Up 
with 

the 
Kardashians” 
to 
“Here 

Comes Honey Boo-Boo,” these 
wildly 
popular 
reality 
TV 

shows 
document 
a 
narrow 

truth that is not applicable 
for most American citizens. 
Nevertheless, 
these 
multi-

million dollar franchises are 
most widely distributed and, 
therefore, the source of the 
most prevalent stereotypes.

What 
America 
needs 
are 

genuine people on camera, like 
those featured in Cut Video’s 
projects. 
In 
a 
recent 
word 

association video, the YouTube 
channel 
gathered 
African-

American men ages 5 through 
50 to respond to “America” with 
a single word. Some of their 
responses were not so optimistic: 
“Free with an asterisk,” a 31-year-
old subject said.

This 
represents 
the 
real 

America, and the very real 
people that are affected by 
its everyday policies. Life in 
the States isn’t an endless 
summer at the Jersey Shore or 
a bottomless pit of McDonald’s. 
So, 
instead 
of 
looking 
to 

“reality” TV and pop sensations 
for a taste of American culture, 
let’s turn the attention to 
outlets like Cut Video that bring 
to screen a more accurate vision 
of America today.

Wolverines fall in 
ITA quarterfinals

Michigan finishes 
on Sunday with no 
semifinal berths

By RILEY NELSON

For the Daily

The Michigan men’s tennis 

team made its way to South 
Bend, Ind., on Thursday to 
compete in the ITA Midwest 
Regional Championships. And 
while 
the 

Wolverines 
ended 
their 

run on Sunday, 
failing to make 
it 
past 
the 

quarterfinals, 
Michigan 
coach 
Adam 

Steinberg saw 
his team play some of its best 
tennis since he took over the 
program in June 2014.

It was the first full team event 

of the fall, with six Michigan 
players in the singles main draw.

“There 
were 
some 
good 

moments,” Steinberg said, “and 
then some moments in singles 
that I feel we really have to 
work on. I was really happy with 
the freshmen — I thought they 
competed great.”

Sophomore Carter Lin fell to 

No. 2 seed Chris Diaz of Ohio 
State in the quarterfinals of the 
singles main draw after playing 
very competitive matches in 
the earlier rounds. He was the 
highlight of the Wolverines’ 
singles competition, but it was 
the doubles efforts that really 
stood out in Steinberg’s mind.

“The best moment I’ve had in 

coaching here at Michigan was 
the other night … when (the) 
doubles teams were playing 

on the courts at Notre Dame,” 
Steinberg said. “It was awesome. 
They were pushing each other, 
playing with amazing energy. 
That’s what we do in practice 
every day, and we took it to the 
tournament, so I was really 
pleased 
with 
the 
doubles 

overall.”

The two teams — redshirt 

sophomore Alex Knight with 
sophomore 
Runhao 
Hua 

and junior Kevin Wong with 
freshman Gabe Tishman — each 

made it to the 
quarterfinals 
before falling 
to 
the 
No. 

1 
and 
No. 

2 
seeds, 

respectively.

Despite not 

making it to 
the final day 

of competition, Steinberg was 
happy with his doubles teams’ 
level of competition.

“I thought it was the best I’ve 

ever seen us play doubles since 
I’ve been here,” Steinberg said. 
“We competed really well. Even 
the matches we lost, we played 
great — it didn’t feel like we even 
lost them because of how well 
we played, competed, and our 
attitude.”

In the fall tennis season there 

are no team results, because all 
athletes compete as individuals 
or in pairs. It’s an opportune 
time for players to fine-tune 
their skills and perfect their 
game.

“Our 
doubles 
has 
really 

improved, but as singles players 
I think everyone needs to really 
commit to their game styles, so 
by the end of the fall that’s set 
in stone,” Steinberg said. “It’s 
not there yet, but it’s definitely 
getting better. Way better.”

Michigan battles to draw 
with Western Michigan

By BETELHEM ASHAME

Daily Sports Writer

Tempers 
flared 
throughout 

the Michigan men’s soccer team’s 
hotly contested affair against 
Western Michigan on Tuesday, 
adding 
even 
more 

tension 
to 

an already-
tough encounter between two 
evenly matched teams.

Through physical possession 

battles in the midfield and hard 
tackles to break up the other 
team’s attack, the two sides fought 
to a scoreless draw in double 
overtime.

While the Wolverines (2-2-2 

Big Ten, 7-4-4 overall) — second 
in the Big Ten in goals per game 
— initially struggled to find their 
feet offensively, their defense 
stepped up to neutralize the 
Broncos’ effort to start fast and 
draw blood in the early stages. 

“How organized we were (at 

the back) took them out of the 
game,” said Michigan junior 
defender Rylee Woods. “Our 
confidence rose after we broke the 
first 20 minutes, and we did well 
the rest of the game.”

The Broncos (1-1-1 MAC, 8-3-4 

overall) kept the ball in their 
attacking third for much of the 
first half, dominating the run of 
play and creating the majority 
of the chances. An endless foray 
of crosses into the box and shots 
on goal forced a response from 
Michigan’s defensive unit, which 
put together a strong defensive 
stand to keep the offense at bay.

Aware that Western Michigan 

would prove to be a handful, 
Michigan coach Chaka Daley 
stuck to his game plan, believing 
his players would be able to handle 
the onslaught. The Wolverines’ 
defense had allowed only one goal 
over the previous three matches 
and continued its run of recent 
success by producing another 
shutout against the Broncos.

“We knew they had some good 

pieces to the puzzle,” Daley said. 
“They have a lot of busy, active 
attacking players, and we thought 

those guys were definitely factors 
in the game. They were kind of 
neutralized tonight and didn’t 
really show their faces too much, 
which is good for us. Our guys on 
defense gave everything and did 
outstanding.”

The dynamic of the game 

changed 
dramatically 
in 
the 

60th minute. After two previous 
breakaway 
runs 
down 
the 

pitch came up empty, Michigan 
freshman 
forward 
Francis 

Atuahene 
sprinted 
toward 
a 

long ball played forward by the 
defense.

Western Michigan’s goalkeeper 

charged toward the top of the box 
in the hope of catching the ball 
before Atuahene could reach it. 
The goalie jumped in the air and 
clutched the ball in his grasp, but 
Atuahene crashed into him with 
questionable intent, sending them 
both to the turf.

With the goalie writhing on 

the ground, the referee had no 

choice but to issue Atuahene a red 
card, disqualifying him from the 
match.

With just 10 men, Michigan 

played stifling defense despite 
several dangerous near-misses 
by the Broncos, managing to 
hold out for the rest of the half 
and all of overtime to earn a 
hard-fought tie.

“From the standpoint of going 

down to 10 players in a tough 
game against a Western Michigan 
side that is a very senior-laden 
team whereas a lot of our guys 
are freshmen and sophomores, 
it’s really outstanding to see the 
commitment and physicality of 
our guys to grind it out,” Daley 
said.

Considering 
the 

circumstances, 
Michigan’s 

resiliency and determination to 
still come away with a point will 
prove to be a real asset for the 
team with the biggest games of 
the season coming up next.

Murphy makes return

Rather than take 
medical redshirt, 
senior returns for 

final games

By KATIE CONKLIN

Daily Sports Writer

It was Sept. 6, the second 

game of the Michigan men’s 
soccer season against Niagara, 
and 
the 
crowd 
was 
tense. 

Entering overtime, the score 
was tied at one.

Stepping toward a rebounded 

ball in the 99th minute, senior 
midfielder 
James 
Murphy 

buried the ball in the back of 
the net. The Wolverine faithful 
erupted in celebration, only to 
be silenced by the blow of the 
referee’s offside whistle. The 
game went to double overtime.

Just two minutes into the 

second period, a foul on top of 
the 18-yard box led to a perfectly 
placed set-piece opportunity. 

Murphy, as he did a few minutes 
prior, 
found 
twine 
with 
a 

powerful header to capture a 
sudden victory.

The following game against 

Maryland, Murphy went down 
with a torn medial collateral 
ligament. He has not seen the 
field since.

Making 
his 
return 
seven 

weeks 
later 

against 
in-state 
rival 

Western 
Michigan 
on 
Tuesday 

evening, 
Murphy 
entered 
the 

game 
with 

four 
minutes 

remaining 
in 

the first half, 
and played a large chunk of the 
second half and overtime period 
in the Wolverines’ scoreless 
double-overtime tie.

“It’s 
been 
really 
tough, 

obviously, my senior year, and 
to sit out most of the season,” 

Murphy said. “It’s great to get 
back in it and just do whatever I 
can do to help this team out and 
help to finish the season strong.”

Though he had the chance 

to take a medical redshirt this 
season, 
Murphy 
declined, 

instead 
opting 
to 
join 
his 

teammates for the final and most 
crucial part of the campaign.

Murphy 

has made an 
impact 
on 

the Michigan 
squad 
ever 

since 
he 

crossed 
the 

pond 
from 

England 
and 

stepped 
on 

the field his 
freshman 
year, earning 

a spot on the 2012 Big Ten All-
Freshman team.

“Whatever he’s got to give this 

team, he wants to offer it,” said 
Michigan coach Chaka Daley. 
“He’s a selfless young man.”

Three years later, Murphy has 

a captain band wrapped around 
his arm, and he plays as selflessly 
on the pitch as he behaves off of 
it.

After playing for just three 

short stints in his comeback 
game, Murphy’s goal is to play 
and enjoy every minute he gets 
on and off of the field with his 
teammates.

“This team means a lot to me, 

and I want to give everything 
I’ve got to help these boys out,” 
Murphy said. “And hopefully 
we’ll win something this year.”

And with two important Big 

Ten games in their future, the 
Wolverines still have a shot to 
do just that. To the excitement 
of both Daley and Murphy, he 
will be back and ready to make 
an impact — as he has in the past 
with 37 career goals.

“He gives everything for the 

team and he’s all about the team 
first,” Daley said.

And Murphy hopes to give 

what he has, whether there are 
two games left in the season 
or 10. Every game after Nov. 4 
could be his last.

“We’ve missed him,” Daley 

said. “Big time.”

The anatomy of a goalie fight

By JUSTIN MEYER

Daily Sports Writer

The No. 10 Michigan hockey 

team brought in a permanent 
goalie coach for the 2015-16 
season 
after 
struggling 
with 

consistency at the position for 
the past few years. Steve Shields, 
an 
ex-Wolverine 
netminder 

and a 10-year NHL veteran, is 
also notorious for being a bit 
of a brawler. One of Shields’ 
altercations 
from 
the 
1990s 

will stand out to old-time fans 
everywhere. The Michigan Daily 
talked with Shields to break down 
the fight.

The following transcript has 

been edited for continuity.

* * *

It was May 3, 1997 in Buffalo, 

New York. Shields was hot as the 
Sabres’ backup goalie, filling in 
competently for the injured Dominik 
Hasek in the NHL playoffs. Buffalo 
won a first-round series against the 
Ottawa Senators before running 
into the Philadelphia Flyers and 
goaltender Garth Snow.

The Michigan Daily: Buffalo 

has pretty colorful jerseys back 
then.

Steve Shields: Oh yeah.
TMD: What was it like for you 

playing in the playoffs?

SS: 
It 
was 
really 
nerve-

wracking at the — a lot of pressure. 
Because we have the best goalie in 
the world — Hasek. He gets hurt, 
and I’m not going to be as good. 
So can we win without having 
our best goalie in there? I played 
well enough for us to win. It was 
a great experience playing playoff 
hockey as a goalie.

With 2:55 to go in the second 

period, a scrum breaks out in front 
of the Flyers’ net.

SS: I’m in the other end — it’s a 

five-on-five brawl.

Garth Snow has been egging 

our team on all year, picking on 
Hasek. Now he’s involved, so he 

would outnumber our guys. I start 
skating down because now he’s in 
it and I gotta go even it up.

We’re jonesing to go at each 

other because we’ve been at it all 
year, and this is the playoffs.

TMD: What’s your attitude 

when 
you’re 
skating 
toward 

center ice?

SS: Like, I hope I don’t fall. Now 

it’s loud and our crowd’s cheering 
and it’s the playoffs. I can’t fall, 
and I can’t go down when I get 
punched.

Shields meets Snow in the corner 

and the two start jawing at each 
other before a teammate breaks up 
the escalating situation.

SS: Bob Boughner is right here 

— he reminds me that we have no 
other goalies. We have a third-
string goalie but nobody else. So 
I’m like, ‘OK, I’ll back off.’

But I know he wants to get a 

piece of me.

Shields skates off to the side, but 

stays just close enough to continue 
the action. Before long, the two 
are back at each other, toppling a 
linesman in the process.

SS: I’m standing at the blue line 

giving him the head nod, and now 
he sees me right here. He comes 
up to me and pulls my mask off 
real easy.

TMD: Now it’s on.
SS: Your eyes just kind of roll 

back into your 
head and it’s 
on.

TMD: That 

poor linesman.

SS: So if I get 

(Snow’s) mask 
off right here, I 
might have the 
best knockout 
in history. And 
I break the top 
of my knuckle 
on his mask.

TMD: And you played after 

that with a broken knuckle?

SS: Yeah, oh yeah. There’s my 

roommate right there, Wayne 
Primeau, yelling at him.

TMD: What’s he yelling?
SS: Every bad thing you can 

imagine. It lasted about a minute, 
the whole scene, and I was just 
gassed.

TMD: 
Did 

you get a five-
minute (major 
penalty) 
for 

that?

SS: I thought 

I 
was 
done, 

that’s 
why 
I 

kind of sold out 
in the fight. But 
now I have to 
go back.

That was a 

whole season in the making. Dom 
(Hasek) was in a scrap earlier on. 
And I’m friends with (Snow), but 
when it happens you gotta go.

I’m not going to say I wasn’t 

excited about it.

TMD: When the refs separate 

you at the end, what’s going 
through your head? Is it like, 
‘Thank God this is over?’

SS: No — I was so tired. I 

felt my hand was hurting, and I 
immediately was thinking, ‘God, if 
his helmet had popped off earlier, 
it would have been an all-time 
great knockout.’ And I was happy I 
didn’t get punched really good.

TMD: Who won that fight?
SS: Come on, I don’t need to 

answer that one. There’s a couple I 
haven’t won, but everyone knows 
about that one.

Shields’ Sabres lost the series in 

five games. Even though Shields 
didn’t get his knockout, the Game 1 
goalie fight went down in history as 
an all-time great playoff moment.

Michigan is 3-0-1 this season and 

plays its second home series against 
Robert Morris this weekend.

JAMES COLLER/Daily

Steve Shields recalled Tuesday a legendary hockey fight he had in 1997.

“There’s a couple 
I haven’t won, but 
everyone knows 
about that one.”

“Whatever he’s 
got to give this 
team, he wants 

to offer it.”

which 

finished tied for fourth place 
at the Las Vegas Collegiate 
Showdown on Tuesday.

The Wolverines shot a school-

record 275 (-13) in the first round, 
and junior Grace Choi soared 
in the second round — tying 
Ashley Bauer’s school-record 
mark of 65, set in 2010. Though 
significant in retrospect, Choi 
was hardly thinking about her 
individual 
triumphs 
during 
tournament 
play.

“I 
wasn’t 

thinking 
about that at 
all,” Choi said. 
“I was so in 
the 
moment, 

it was such a high. I wasn’t 
worried about breaking school 
records. … It was an incredible 
experience.”

Michigan 
played 
with 
a 

mental edge throughout the 
tournament, notching scores 
of 275, 279 and 281 in the three 
days, ultimately finishing nine 
strokes behind the champion, 
UNLV.

The 
tournament, 
the 

conclusion to the Wolverines’ 
successful fall season, followed 
a third-place finish at the Yale 
Intercollegiate two weeks ago.

“The team’s been gaining 

confidence 
throughout 
the 

fall,” said Michigan coach Jan 
Dowling.

Some of the improvement 

can likely be attributed to Choi 
and senior Catherine Peters, 
the team’s only upperclassmen. 
Peters put up scores of 68, 68 and 
69 en route to tying Choi for fifth 

in the individual standings this 
weekend. Yet beyond their golf 
skills, the two lead in ways that 
can’t be recorded on a scorecard.

“(Choi and Peters) both lead 

by example in so many ways,” 
Dowling said. “You couldn’t 
ask for better upperclassmen. 
They’re 
encouraging 
and 

positive, and really want to leave 
their mark on this program.”

In addition to influencing 

underclassmen, Choi and Peters 
have a great impact on each 
other on the golf course. After 
spending three years playing 
together and two years living 

with 
each 

other, the two 
friends 
have 

built a unique 
bond.

“She’s 
one 

of 
the 
most 

positive people 
I 
have 
ever 

met,” 
Choi 

said of Peters. 

“That’s something that I’m not 
as good at, so she just radiates all 
this really good energy.”

Teamwork and cooperation 

have long been building blocks 
of Dowling’s model for winning 
tournaments and improving as a 
unit. After a strong fall season, 
Michigan will look to continue 
getting better before returning 
to tournament play in February.

The Wolverines expect to 

work primarily on strength 
and conditioning, while also 
studying individual tendencies 
to 
identify 
strengths 
and 

weaknesses.

“We stay pretty busy (during 

the winter),” Dowling said. “We 
really take advantage of those 
months to (review) the season a 
little bit better.”

Michigan plans to remember 

the record-setting weekend for 
the time being, but knows it still 
has plenty to prepare for.

WOMEN’S GOLF

“I was so in the 
moment, it was 
such a high.”

Minor shines at 
ITA Regionals

By NATHANIEL CLARK

Daily Sports Writer

The 
legendary 
Brazilian 

soccer player Pelé once said, 
“The more difficult the victory, 
the greater the happiness in 
winning.”

Freshman Brienne Minor of 

the Michigan women’s tennis 
team discovered that wisdom 
firsthand, as she rallied from a 
5-1 hole in her final set to win a 
singles title over Northwestern’s 
Maddie Lipp at the ITA Midwest 
Regional Championships. This 
was the third consecutive year 
— and the fourth time in the last 
five years — that a Wolverine 
has come away with a singles 
victory in the tournament.

After Minor erased her deficit 

and took a 6-5 edge, Lipp won 
the next game to tie the set at 
six, which set up a tiebreaker. 
Minor rose to the occasion, 
going on a 3-1 run en route to a 
7-3 victory to capture the title.

“It 
was 

amazing 
to 

see (Minor) 
compete like 
that,” 
said 

Michigan 
coach 
Ronnie 
Bernstein. 
“I think she 
just believes in herself and has 
such a big game where she can 
win a whole bunch of points in 
a row.”

Minor dropped the first game 

of the final set to Lipp, 6-3, but 
quickly took a 4-0 lead in the 
second. Lipp found her groove, 
however, and evened the score 
at 5-5. The pair split the next 
two sets before Minor won the 
tiebreaker, 7-5.

“It was really good tennis for 

both of them,” Bernstein said. 
“Both wanted (the match) a lot. 
(Minor) really hung in there and 
that was the difference.”

Minor also had a strong 

doubles 
performance. 
She 

teamed up with sophomore 

Mira Ruder-Hook to top Ani 
Gogvadze and Maria Paula 
Ribero of Eastern Michigan, 8-2. 
They also defeated Michigan 
State’s duo of Erin Faulkner and 
Lexi Baylis, 8-3, before losing, 
8-5, in the quarterfinals to Ohio 
State’s pair of Sandy Niehaus 
and Ferny Angelez Paz.

“(Minor 
and 
Ruder-Hook) 

complement each other pretty 
well,” Bernstein said. “I thought 
they communicated well.”

But Minor was not the only 

freshman to have an impressive 
showing. Kate Fahey defeated 
Michigan State’s Lexi Baylis 
and 
Ohio 
State’s 
Anna 

Sanford in two and three sets, 
respectively. Fahey faltered in 
the singles play quarterfinals 
to Lipp.

Ruder-Hook, 
too, 
came 

up 
with 
a 
solid 
singles 

performance. She notched wins 
over Western Michigan’s Melina 
Lyubomirova, 6-4, 7-5, and 
Illinois’s Louise Kwong, 6-4, 

4-6, 7-6 before 
succumbing 
to 
DePaul’s 

Yuliya 
Shupenia.

“She’s 

starting 
to 

understand 
what 
she 

needs to do 

on the court,” Bernstein said. 
“I was really happy with her 
performance 
and 
how 
she 

competed.”

Building on an impressive 

outing, Michigan still has more 
tennis to play this fall. The 
Wolverines will travel to the 
UNC Invitational Nov. 6-8, 
before moving onto the ITA 
National Indoor Championships 
and the ASU Thunderbird Nov. 
13-15.

“I just want (the players) to 

compete,” Bernstein said. “I feel 
like come January, with the kids 
we’ve added and our returners, 
that we’ll be ready and hopefully 
we can have another great 
season.”

WOMEN’S TENNIS

“It was amazing 
to see (Minor) 

compete like that.”

Harbaugh’s manners pay off

By MAX COHEN

Managing Sports Editor

Jim Harbaugh does not always 

give the appearance of someone 
who asks for things nicely.

During his final year with the 

San Francisco 49ers, rumors 
circulated that Harbaugh wore 
his players down with his high 
demands 
and 
dogged 
work 

ethic. Even now, on the sidelines 
of Michigan Stadium, it is not 
an uncommon sight to see 
Harbaugh yelling a referee’s ear 
into oblivion.

But 
sometimes, 
when 
it 

comes to asking things of his 
players, Harbaugh minds his 
manners. He brought up the 
subject during his weekly press 
conference Monday, when a 
reporter questioned the coach 
about the emergence of senior 
tight end A.J. Williams.

The natural inclination is that 

Williams’ success is the result 
of Harbaugh’s tight end-centric 
offense and that Williams has 
improved in the same manner 
many 
of 
Michigan’s 
other 

players have.

Monday, Harbaugh said there 

was more to it. He realized 
Williams needed to run faster, so 
Williams did what was natural: 
He lost some weight. But that 
wasn’t 
all 
that 
has 
fueled 

Williams’ increased role in the 
offense.

It came down to an innocuous 

question — a very polite one 
at that — that Harbaugh asked 
Williams:

“Please, will you run faster, 

A.J.?”

And so far, Williams has. He 

has had two receptions of more 
than 20 yards this season. His 
previous career long was 12 yards.

Through seven games this 

season, 
Williams 
has 
more 

catches (nine) than he did in 
his first three years at Michigan 
combined (five). He ranks fourth 
among Wolverines in receptions 
and receiving yards (99).

Harbaugh’s 
methodology 

of asking politely has paid 
dividends so far.

“Sometimes 
that 
works,” 

Harbaugh said. “I’ve seen it 
work before. ‘Will you please 
run faster?’ And then they do, so 
hope (Williams keeps) going in 
that direction, because he’s got 
it in him.”

Even 
the 
other 
part 
of 

Williams’ success, the one that 
didn’t have to do with Harbaugh 
minding his p’s and q’s, was the 
result of another soft-spoken 
comment from the fiery coach.

It 
came 
during 
spring 

practice, one of Harbaugh’s 
first, after Williams ran what 
he remembers as a stick rout. 
Harbaugh 
then 
commented 

on what he thought caused 
Williams’ lack of speed.

“He was just like, ‘A.J., I think 

you need to lose some weight,’ ” 
Williams said.

Williams, even as a senior 

who had established himself in 
the program, did not question 
the rhetoric of his new coach. He 
responded immediately.

“I was like, ‘Yeah, I probably 

do,’ ” Williams replied.

So Williams did. He currently 

weighs 10 pounds less than his 
listed weight of 285 pounds.

Harbaugh arrived at Michigan 

with a great deal of success in 
developing tight ends, from 
Zach Ertz and Coby Fleener 
at Stanford to Vernon Davis in 
San Francisco. Well aware of 
this, Williams was willing to do 
whatever his coach asked.

In the past, Williams had been 

almost exclusively a blocking 
tight end, even in high school. 
He played offensive tackle his 
senior year and did not catch a 
single pass.

But now, in his senior year of 

college, Williams has caught the 
ball more than he ever has. Not 
just in college or his senior year 
of high school, but in his entire 
life. Having the ball in his hands 
did not feel natural at first, 
particularly after his 22-yard 
reception in the home opener 
against Oregon State.

“I was like, ‘This is weird,’ ” 

Williams said. “I was like, ‘Oh 
man, I can’t believe I just did 
that.’ ”

Four weeks later, when the 

Wolverines played Northwestern, 
Williams was Michigan’s leading 
receiver, with four receptions for 
48 yards.

Williams, 
because 
of 

Harbaugh’s requests and the 
team’s success, says he is having 
more fun playing football than 
he has in his entire life. 

But while Williams enjoys 

increased success, other players 
are still working on fulfilling 
the things Harbaugh requests of 
them.

The coach’s request of redshirt 

junior offensive lineman Kyle 
Kalis is lofty:

“Get all your blocks, don’t 

miss any blocks,” Kalis said 
Harbaugh tells him.

With just a slight hint of 

sarcasm, Kalis said he believes he 
has fulfilled Harbaugh’s wishes.

“Never miss any (blocks),” 

Kalis said. “Never. I’m always 
perfect.”

Senior linebacker Joe Bolden was confined to the locker room after being ejected for targeting in Michigan’s game against Michigan State on Oct. 17.
Joe Bolden’s loneliest view

By MAX BULTMAN

Daily Sports Editor

It wasn’t the day’s most jarring 

moment, and it didn’t happen 
in front of 111,000 people, but 
the moment Joe Bolden walked 
into the locker room was surreal 
nonetheless.

The senior linebacker had just 

been ejected for targeting from 
the Michigan football team’s 
game against Michigan State on 
Oct. 17, and after taking a half-
lap around the edge of the field, 
slapping hands and trying to get 
the crowd fired up, he arrived at 
the locker room to find the only 
person in the entire stadium 
who could relate to him in that 
moment.

Senior linebacker James Ross 

III was already standing at the 
door waiting for him, serving 
his punishment for the same 
penalty the prior game.

“I told him, ‘Hey, it’s your 

turn,’ ” Bolden recalled Tuesday. 
“So we kind of (traded) spots. 
Not sure that’s the ideal situation 
where you want to trade spots, 
but we watched the end of the 

second (quarter) together, and 
you could tell that he was ready 
to go, he was ready to come out 
and play as well.”

In the second quarter, Bolden 

appeared to be pushed into 
Spartans’ quarterback Connor 
Cook. And while his helmet-to-
helmet contact with Cook looked 
unintentional, he was ejected, 
and thus relegated to watch 
the 
second 

half from the 
locker 
room. 

In his senior 
year, it was his 
last shot at the 
Spartans.

A year ago, 

Bolden 
found 

himself 
at 

the 
center 

of 
a 
minor 

controversy 
surrounding the rivalry game 
after he planted a stake in the 
Spartan Stadium turf. Michigan 
State coach Mark Dantonio later 
termed the act disrespectful and 
cited it as his reason for adding 
a late touchdown after the game 
was already decided.

But his shot at redemption 

this season was cut short by the 
ejection. So as he went off the 
field, he implored the crowd 
to stay invested in the game, 
as if they needed any further 
incentive to cheer.

“I think it was important (for 

the crowd) to know that life goes 
on,” Bolden said. “Even though 
you’re gonna lose a guy, the No. 

1 defense is 
still out on the 
field, and you 
guys need to 
stay 
behind 

them.”

As 
Bolden 

paraded 
the 

perimeter 
of 

the 
stadium, 

he 
jumped 

up and down, 
waving 
his 

arms, especially in front of the 
student section.

“(Michigan 
recruiting 

coordinator 
Chris 
Partridge) 

was pulling me off the field,” 
Bolden said. “I probably would 
have made it a couple of laps if it 
wasn’t for him.”

Ross, of course, returned to 

the field for the second half, 
since his carry-over suspension 
only lasted the first.

That left Bolden to either 

watch the game in the locker 
room, or seek another option.

“I actually went ahead and 

got on my phone and read every 
rule in the rulebook as soon as 
it happened, just to make sure 
there wasn’t any loopholes that 
could get anywhere else, other 
than a 10-by-5-foot room to 
watch the game,” he said.

Bolden 
was 
referring 
to 

finding another way to watch the 
game, preferably on the field. But 
he didn’t find one. So when Blake 
O’Neill’s fumble landed in the 
arms of Jalen Watts-Jackson, 
who returned it for a touchdown 
in an ending that shocked the 
nation, Bolden experienced it 
differently from the rest of his 
teammates. The TV was on a 
delay, and he couldn’t share his 
shock with any of them.

“Crickets,” he said. “I couldn’t 

hear anything. Just crickets. 
And then I walked out of the 
room.”

“I think it was 
important to 
know that life 

goes on.”

THE statement

Wednesday, October 28, 2015 // The Statement

COVER BY LUNA ANNA ARCHEY

“

All you need is a blonde, beer, and a love story 
or a broken heart.” He explained country 
songs as we perched on bar stools. He revealed 

the meaning of a Yeti 110 iced down and silver bul-
lets.

When I took a 6-week internship in the middle 

of the country, I had no idea that my summer would 
include all these things.

I was more terrified to make the journey to 

Topeka, Kansas than the adventure I made to India 
my first half of the summer. When imagining India, 
I was apprehensive, but assured that I would be 
occupied with work, cultural experiences, and the 
company of two other University students.

An internship at The Capital-Journal was a 

looming shadow of what might possibly be my life 
for the next few years: working at a dying publica-
tion in a city where I didn’t know a soul.

***

With an uncharacteristic confidence, he asked 

the girl in cheap boots and a purple backless dress 
swirling around the dance floor of the country 
saloon to dance. With a confidence uncharacteris-
tic of myself I told his friend to invite me to Denny’s 
with them after closing time.

Afterward, with a forgetfulness completely 

characteristic of myself, I locked my keys in my 
car at 4 a.m., and with the kindness and chivalry 
completely characteristic of him, he walked me the 
three and a half miles to his truck and drove me to 
my doorstep.

Fast forward two weeks. A night in the bed of his 

truck stargazing; the warm concrete of the Kansas 
City Chiefs arena parking lot; attempting to teach 
him the two-step I myself still hadn’t perfected; a 
blues concert. I found myself curled up next to him 
as we drove home from Kansas City. The light of 
his radio displayed the Ed Sheeran CD playing, and 
I hopelessly attempted to convince him I was a bad 

idea.

I had failed at three long distance relation-

ships before they had barely even started, and one 
of them was only a fifteen-minute drive away. I 
didn’t know how to tell him that with three states 
between us, these summer nights would remain a 
distant — if warm — memory. Commitment was a 
pleasant thought, especially as our conversations 
stretched hours, but my better judgment and self-
doubt crippled the audacity I typically jump at life 
with. This proposition was a completely different 
kind of adventure, a long, treacherous, and at times 
almost certainly a lonely one.

Even though I grew up in a farm town of 5,000, 

I was never a part of country culture. I lived in the 
country but my adventures included books and 
sports, not guns and trucks. I have fought so hard 
to escape it. Despite most of me making it out of 
my hick hometown, of all places, I now find at least 
a portion of my heart-claiming stake in another 
small town in eastern Kansas.

When I first made the fourteen-hour drive, I 

never could have expected I would be sitting here 
in late September, spending hours playing with 
the presets of cheap travel sites. Fighting to find 
a ticket. Frustrated that during my afternoon run 
everyone doesn’t cheerily greet me, that not every 
cashier engages me in conversation. Frustrated 
that new people don’t ask where my “exotic” accent 
is from. Frustrated that the crowded dance floor 
of Rick’s has replaced the polished hardwood and 
rhythmic clockwise rotation of bejeweled cow-
boy boots of Wild Horse. Frustrated that of all the 
places I could be missing, it’s Topeka, Kansas. And 
most of all, frustrated that I can’t jump in my car 
with the windows rolled down, pick Brett Eldredge 
from any of the multitude of stations playing coun-
try, and drive down the road to the fraternity park-
ing lot where his 1982 Ford pick-up truck is parked.

My newfound tolerance of country music

ILLUSTRATION BY LUNA ANNA ARCHEY

Let’s get personal. 

Every writer I’ve spoken to has said 
the same thing: writing about yourself 
seems easy, until you sit down to do 
it. How can you possibly consolidate 
your deepest emotions and regrets 
into several hundred words? How 
can you reveal your intimate self to a 
faceless audience? 

Writing a Personal Statement takes 
courage and self-awareness. In these 
pages you will find seven stories of 
love, of loss, of heartbreak, of anger. 
Seven stories from those who dared 
to pour their hearts out onto the page; 
who took the leap and wrote about 
themselves. But as you can imagine, 
when people sit down to write about 
themselves, it rarely becomes about 
them. We peer into their lives and 
find our own beloved mothers, 
conflicted hometowns, favorite 
movies and formative teachers.

These stories matter to all of us.

The weight of bubbles and boxes

by Anisha Nandi, Daily Staff Reporter

I 

sat beneath the weight of a three-letter acronym and I 
felt unknown. For all the countless hours spent to mold 
and mend my mind into standardized testing, I had no 

answer for the very first question in the crisp, white booklet 
in front of me. I fidgeted as the clock ticked deafeningly. I see 
the physical boxes on the paper in front of me and it’s sharp 
edges cut sharp corners in my round mind. They simply do 
not fit.

“Race/Ethnicity.”
A few identities swirl and surface before I shove them 

away.

“I’m half Trinidadian, half Indian; I was born in England 

but I grew up in New York.”

There is no box to check off there, no bubble teems to the 

surface. At the very best I am “other.” My identity, with its 
colorful exuberance and undiscovered parts, with its proud 
history and fierce defiance, is crammed and shoved imper-
sonally into that small box.

Those boxes become most dangerous when we find the 

need to fit into them. Before I turned seven, I moved around 
half a dozen times within the tri-state area. I counted rosa-
ry beads in a Catholic school but silent Hindu prayers ran 
through my mind as each rough, red bead slipped through 
small fingers. I ate rose-colored candies and homemade soda 
bread with our fair, Irish neighbors and their beloved bea-
gle, Mickey, with his watery, all-knowing eyes and ears that 
swept the floors. My big brown eyes lit up my small face in 
preschool when my mother agreed to “plait” my hair in two 
long braids just like my Jamaican friend did her wild locks. 
I climbed on countertops with knocked knees and a wicked 
smile to find “that thing,” my favorite Indian spice, before my 
grandmother pulled me down and sat me on her lap — the 
folds of her saari taking me to visit all the rich smells of her 
country, my country. As I entered middle school, I learned 
torah verses as I attended more bar and bat mitvahs (and a 
few b’nai mitzvahs) than I can count on my hands and feet.

In my high school years, I filled in many bubbles. From 

that sea of multiple-choice questions, I dove and somehow 
swam ashore in the Midwest — a place I, at the time, associ-
ated with cornfields and windmills, yet one that has brought 
me more cultural clarity than I ever could have thought. In 

a single day, I cross paths with hundreds of students, their 
story traced across campus as they run to class or schlep 
begrudgingly through the snow across the Diag. I learn from 
and about them, whether it’s laughing through my tears 
with my best friend in her room at 2 a.m. or making brief 
eye contact with a student in the first floor of the Ugli. Each 
day as I brush elbows, my cultural index grows. As I arrive 
home, the promise of New York City with its jagged buildings 
across the eternally lit backdrop stirs awake all the cultural 
magnificence there is to see. Traveling between the multi-
cultural dichotomies of the University of Michigan and New 
York City provides me with endless opportunities to open my 
mind to the backgrounds of others. I always compare them 
to two different “worlds” intersecting that I hardly believe 
exist outside of myself.

***

I now trace my way through my heritage. My mother is 

fair skinned with light eyes and naturally wavy black hair 
made for the summer heat of an eternally sunny island. It 
puffs and swells in the humidity as if trying to capture the 
salty sea air. Her high cheekbones sit beneath the shadows 
of long eyelashes, catching the low light as she laughs, one 
of the most reserved of her boisterous family. My father is 
frozen at a permanent state of youth. His eyes glint a perpet-
ual glee, one never subdued by the weight of the world. His 
trademark salt and pepper moustache sits atop an eternally 
lit smile refusing to bow to the bulky world.

My mother grew up the second youngest of seven, in a 

well-respected, well-off family in Chaguanas, Trinidad. 
Her medical school experience was filled with homesick-
ness as she travelled across seas away from her family. My 
mother is from a ferociously proud breed of polouri-loving, 
cricket-watching “Trinis.” Trinis underline their lives with 
the emboldened red and black of their flag, never failing to 
showcase their pride in their country — one with less than 
the population of Manhattan that still manages to boast 
Nobel Prize laureates, multiple Miss World Titles, World 
Cup qualifiers and Olympic gold medalists.

My father, halfway across the world, grew up in New 

Delhi. At age six he saw a blind man in a rural suburb of India 
and, in the endearing hopeful charm of a young child, he 

swore to himself he would become a doctor to help him. He 
sewed his own repairs on his primary school uniform, hem-
ming to the hums of the crickets in the high grass and bee-
hives in the trees and studying to maintain his scholarship. 
He read voraciously to quench an undying thirst for knowl-
edge of all kinds, tucking away information like gemstones 
in an encyclopedia of jewels. His hands helped his mother 
around the house, feeding cows dalpuri and creating jars of 
pickled spices, while his mind wandered over fields, across 
seas, through amazons, to the depths of oceans and heights 
of fighter planes. 

In Pondicherry, India that Trindadian challenged that 

New Delhi native with her quiet strength. Something about 
their meeting spurred three decades of marriage. They 
moved to England for their residencies and eventually to 
New York. My mother retains her strong sense of pride in 
Trinidad and often chance takes us to warm beaches or to 
the smell of doubles and polouri in Queens. Nothing quite 
compares to the lackadaisical days of hammocks drifting 
between tall coconut trees.

From plastic surgery to cardiology to published research 

to wound healing, my father invested that six-year-old’s 
promise in his passion for medicine. His upbringing in India, 
surrounded by immense medical resources in contrast to 
some of the most earth-shattering illnesses, was a major fac-
tor in his success today. He often dreams aloud of his desire 
to reground his roots upon the rocky hills of Rishikesh or the 
busy, rickshaw-filled streets of New Delhi with all the color 
and culture that flutters beneath his eyelids. He tells me time 
and again that all that man needed was a few pills of vitamin 
A and he would be able to see those same colors.

If I were to sit there with my pencil now on that ACT 

exam, I would not want to fill out “other.” All of our back-
grounds are to be embraced, to be celebrated. Not just the 
complex ones or the misunderstood ones, but each individ-
ual’s heritage. The conclusions and boxes we jump into, we 
often create for ourselves. To take a moment and consider 
that somebody may have an interesting story is to recognize 
your own. Standardized tests are just that — standard. Yet 
we can decide to set no limits on the vibrancy of our cultured, 
colorful realities.

I 

dreaded my twelfth birthday.

I was panicked — I wasn’t ready for this. I 

tried to skew the details to my advantage: really, 

I’d been six and a half when she died. So double that 
would be … thirteen. Whew. One more year until I 
had lived half of my life without her.

I did a quick mental check, listing off the facts. 

I always wanted to know more facts. I made lists, 
scratching tiny numbers down the side of lined paper 
(or a sticky note, or diary page), thinking that if I 
knew more facts, it somehow made me know her.

1. She worked at the airport.
2. She studied math at UCLA.
3. She had a great smile.
4. She liked to remind people to not take life too 

seriously (this one was my favorite).

I listed them, the facts, as if it all could be mastered 

like a test, and by knowing the answers I achieved a 
mastery of her entire being.

I would list off the memories, too. Going to 

Blockbuster, anticipating the plunk of the hard and 
dusty gumball as it rattled from the machine into my 
hand. Me, soaking wet and laughing with glee as she 
greeted me at the exit of a water ride at SeaWorld. 
Riding my Razor Scooter on the hardwood floor when 
she pretended not to know. Her smile as I handed her 
a homemade Mother’s Day card crusted with pink 
glitter glue. And then I would get sad, thinking that 
the first three years of life don’t really count, because 
who really remembers them? Maybe bits and flashes, 
but nothing to put on the list. But it didn’t matter, I 
needed those years to count. So they did.

WhEn my thirteenth birthday loomed, I was 

terrified. It wasn’t fair, it felt like such betrayal. She 
meant so much more than just half of my life. Really, 
I’d been older than six and a half when it happened. 
In fact, I’d been six years, seven months, and eleven 
days old. Which is practically seven, right? So if I was 

seven, double that would be fourteen. Whew. One 
more year.

I reveled in anything that was once hers. Her thin 

blue crew socks became my lucky socks. Photos of her 
friends and of her life — before I was her life — filled 
my photo albums. There she was, on a cable car in San 
Francisco (I wondered if maybe I’d ridden the same 
one); now she was in Mexico, her head dipped to her 
chest because she had fallen asleep while reading on 
the beach. She made goofy faces. Blew out birthday 
candles. It was strange to think that she existed 
before those seven years of my life. But it was even 
stranger to think that so many of her things still 
existed without her. Her driver’s license, her day 
planner, her receipts. Her humble penny collection in 
a dusty jar. They had touched her hands, occupied her 
thoughts. She was so close.

My fourteenth birthday passed, and with it, the 

struggle was over. I couldn’t argue with myself 
anymore. I felt a tiny fraction of my heart, this 
enormous tiny fraction, chip away.

I watched a home video that had been taped when 

I was five, on Christmas morning. I leapt up and 
showed her the new Pokémon toy Santa had brought 
me, squeaking, “Look!” And she smiled as if she was 
just as amazed as I was.

“What is it, Rachael?” she asked.
Everything inside me froze when I heard her voice. 

A feeling of dread snaked its way through my veins 
and my heart jumped and squirmed in my chest, 
forgetting all sense of rhythm.

I realized I couldn’t even remember that voice. It 

sounded so foreign, I wanted to cry. How much did I 
even remember? I couldn’t even recall the fact that I 
unwrapped the next gift, a garish Barbie, with such 
joy.

Now the silent memories came creeping in, the 

memories I never wrote on the lists because I knew 

they could not be forgotten: the powdery, choking 
fragrance of white lilies; the impossibly frigid touch 
of her skin; the love letters I’d written to her in fat 
colorful markers on pristinely folded printer paper, 
tucked under her hand — all lost under the earth with 
her beauty.

In that dreadful moment of betrayal, in the moment 

when her voice rumbled out and didn’t reassure me, I 
knew that it wasn’t the numbers that mattered.

The feelings I had felt when she was wrenched 

away from me, and still sometimes felt in waves, dull 
and sharp and overwhelming in my gut, the feelings I 
felt burning in the creases of my eyes and pooling on 
my pillow, slamming out of my mouth in sharp gasps 
at night — those were proof of what actually mattered. 
The facts (oh, to hell with the facts) could be stuffed 
into crumbling wallets along with her receipts. 
The knowledge that she would have brought those 
warm arms around me even when I wrote childish 
disjointed letters of “You are meen” and slipped them 
under her bedroom door, even when she barely had 
the strength to lift her arms at all — that was what 
mattered. There was no way to quantify the silent “I 
love you, too,” that I knew she wanted to say when she 
could barely breathe, even with her oxygen machine, 
when I whispered those words to her and they floated 
down to softly rest on her cheeks like the sticky tears 
that rested on mine. She would be with me even when 
I was eighteen, or twenty-one, or whatever form of six 
or seven times three or four or five I chose. Even when 
I was a hundred years old, she wouldn’t be reduced to 
just a fraction of my existence.

On my fifteenth birthday, I felt just fine.

Let me count the ways

Being is strange

by Carly Snider, Daily Arts Writer

B

eing is strange. The relationship between 
yourself and your mind is equally as odd. Your 
mind can play tricks on you or nurture you — 

it can convince you that you really do pull off those 
flare jeans or it can gently bring you the conclusion 
that you actually look like a sad, denim-clad John 
Travolta á la “Saturday Night Fever.” Everyone has 
dealt with periods of mental distress at one time or 
another — anxiety, overwhelming stress, depression, 
etc. If you haven’t, you’re probably some kind of 
deity reincarnate who has managed to surpass the 
mental abilities of us mere mortals.

Mental illness is much more pervasive than many 

of us know. This is something I didn’t realize until 
I came to the University as a freshman last year. 
The openness with which the University addresses 
student mental health issues blew me away. You 
mean you can, like, say the word “depression” 
in public and people don’t immediately become 
uncomfortably silent? Astonishing.

This transition provided such a stark contrast to 

my high school experience. Growing up in mind-
numbing suburbia gifted me little to no exposure 
to mental health knowledge or resources. Mental 
illness was something so quickly swept under the 
rug that even the smallest remnants of its shameful 
dust were nowhere to be found. If someone was 
thought to be struggling, whispers would float 
around suggesting that they had “problems” or that 
they (gasp) were in therapy. Depression was a dirty 
word.

It was during these years of zero-tolerance that 

my depression and anxiety disorder began to creep 
up on me — though, at the time, I didn’t know what 
was really happening. I knew the symptoms of these 
conditions, but, of course, I didn’t learn them from 
school — much too taboo — and I couldn’t fathom 
the thought that it was me who was suffering. I was 

in a constant state of unrest, had no interest in old 
passions and couldn’t sleep, but I was fine! I mean, 
when someone asks you how you are doing, is there 
really any other option but to answer with an upbeat 
“OK”?

This charade continued up until the second 

semester of my freshman year of college, when 
my squirming, scratching psyche reached the 
point of implosion. The combination of my alien 
environment, increased level of academic rigor 
and absence of close friends and family became too 
much for me. I started taking Prozac.

What then followed was one of the strangest 

evolutions of my life. Placed in my hand by my 
oh-so-willing doctor was a pill — a pill that would 
apparently shake me from my hopeless, zombie-like 
stupor. Admittedly, I was skeptical. I was scared. 
I had heard too many complaints that privileged 
American youth like myself are over-medicated, 
that anti-depressants are used as a cure-all for any 
mental trepidation. How could these innocent, 
unimposing capsules conquer the demons that I had 
been silently attempting to vanquish for years? And 
if they did work, who would I be without the illness 
that I had carried with me for so long?

But I trusted my parents and I trusted my doctor 

and, for the first time in quite some time, I trusted 
myself. So I started popping those little white pills 
every day. After a while, I noticed that some warmth 
seemed to have seeped back into my being. I was 
sleeping better, was no longer shaken to the core by 
unfamiliar social interactions and found that I was 
actually able to enjoy being a college student. I have 
since continued on my medication, and have come 
to think fondly of those small pills I once held with 
such uncertainty.

My biggest problem with being on anti-

depressants was just that — being medicated. There 

is such a strong stigma against mental illness in the 
United States that I didn’t know how to handle my 
newfound identifier. I figured I had two options: 
hide it or don’t give a shit. I chose the latter.

Everyone has his or her Goliath — that aspect of 

themselves that needs a little push, a little outside 
influence to nudge them in the right direction. 
Something I have heard recently, probably in some 
completely unrelatable black and white PSA, is the 
phrase, “It’s OK to not be OK.” This is true, but it 
needs to be taken one step further. In facing my 
depression, I realized it’s OK for other people to 
know you’re not OK. Admitting you are having 
trouble with life shouldn’t be followed by a pregnant 
silence, but rather by an upwelling of connectivity 
with those persons around you. (Read: Everyone is 
human, blah, blah, blah, don’t be a jerk.)

But really, grappling with your personal sense of 

being is something we all must face at one point or 
another. It is that looming confrontation you need 
to have with your roommate about how she really 
needs to stop eating all of your Cheez-Its — it’s going 
to be uncomfortable but you’ll feel so much better 
once you do it. I think we can all agree that life is 
odd and that the mind is even stranger. Sometimes 
it can feel as though your brain is purposefully 
working against you, like when you accidentally call 
your GSI “mom,” or something. 

It might take some time, as was the case with 

myself, to be on good terms with your mind, but 
it will happen. The most important thing I have 
learned through my weird, cringingly cliché-indie-
teen-movie-esque transition is that everything is 
temporary. Like that old Greek guy said, “Change 
is the only constant.” When you are feeling stuck in 
a stagnant state, know that you are allowed to seek 
out a tether to grasp, and that needing an anchor is 
anything but abnormal.

Guilt of getting out 

by Amanda Allen, Assistant Photo Editor

ILLUSTRATION BY JAKE WELLINS

A

s a senior in high school deciding on which uni-
versity to attend, I only had one non-negotiable 
criteria: must not be near home. I’m from Flint, 

Michigan, and as I say to people who may not know 
about the reputation of Flint, it’s like a smaller version 
of Detroit.

As Wikipedia describes it, “Flint has been ranked 

among the ‘Most Dangerous Cities in the United 
States,’ with a per capita violent crime rate seven times 
higher than the national average. The city was under 
a state of financial emergency from 2011 to 2015, the 
second in a decade.”

Despite living on the outskirts of the city in the sub-

urbs (let’s face it, in the white-flight areas), the effects 
of living in a low socioeconomic and potentially dan-
gerous area infiltrated my life. My high school had 
the classic “the gym teacher is also the art teacher” 
kind of conundrum. My family had to drive out of the 
way to the next town for groceries because slowly but 
surely the stores around us closed. It was either that 
or go to the store in the “bad” part of town.

In high school, I had the feeling that I had to get 

out now, or I thought that I never would. I knew I could 
save money by going to one of the local colleges or uni-
versities, but I would still be in the same disadvantaged 
area. I saw no future for myself in Flint. I saw living in 
fear of walking out of a grocery store at night, as my 
grandmother was when she was thrown to the ground 
and robbed. I saw laughing off another homicide in the 
news with uneasy apprehension.

But, like Detroit, that is not the whole story of the 

city. I don’t want to paint Flint as a city devoid of 
anything positive — that wouldn’t be fair. There is 
definitely good, as all of my friends at University of 
Michigan-Flint, Kettering University, Baker College 

and Mott Community College (all in Flint!) can attest 
to. There is the Flint Cultural Center, which provides 
great art, music and theatre community events and 
education. There is the Flint Public Library with all of 
its glorious books. Downtown Flint is beautiful, with 
its iconic iron archways and brick lanes lined by his-
toric buildings.

Flint just wasn’t for me, though. Despite the good, I 

felt the negatives overshadowed it. It didn’t help that 
there is a strange complacency, at least in my commu-

nity, that “this is how it is and this is how it will always 
be.” People shake their heads at the violence yet just 
turn the channel when they’re tired of hearing about 
this week’s shootings rather than doing something to 
combat it. I didn’t want to be OK with simply shrug-
ging these things off and tailoring my life to avoid them.

Even though Ann Arbor may physically be only an 

hour drive away, it feels like another world. Like other 
first generation students and those from lower socio-
economic areas might feel, university life was strangely 
foreign. Supported by a single mother, I struggle with 
having less capital than the general U of M population 
(sorry friends, $50 is nowhere near “cheap” for me) and 

feeling generally unprepared. I remember in the first 
few weeks of college being so impressed and intimidat-
ed at the way that people articulated in speech, even 
in everyday conversations, that I was afraid to speak at 
all.

One friend, who attended the same high school as me 

and now also attends the University, once expressed 
that she felt guilty for leaving so many friends behind 
to deal with Flint and its hardships. This sentiment 
surprised me, as it was something I had honestly never 
thought of. It stuck with me, and I realized it was a 
great way to articulate a feeling I couldn’t pin down.

A feeling that had me caught between never really 

wanting to go back but anxious to reach out to friends 
in Flint dealing with broken families. A feeling that 
made me wonder why I chose to study international 
issues at the University rather than focus on serious 
issues right in my backyard. It was guilt for not doing 
more with the resources I have now. It was guilt for 
complaining about all of this when I wasn’t from the 
“real Flint” and subjected to gang violence and serious 
blight, which are very real things for a lot of residents. 
It was guilt for getting out when others couldn’t.

However, I can’t feel guilty for the privileges I’ve 

been afforded. I should not feel guilty for doing what’s 
best for me. With luck and a whole lot of scholarships, 
I am very happy to have been provided the opportunity 
to attend this amazing university in Ann Arbor. I feel 
so confident and safe and I’ve made the best of friends. 
I commend all who stay in Flint, doing good works and 
trying to move the city forward. I commend all of the 
hard workers in Flint, just trying to make a living and 
make a good life for themselves and their children. But 
for me, I think leaving was one of the best decisions I’ve 
made for myself.

Even though Ann Arbor 
may physically be only an 
hour drive away, it feels 

like another world.

Social Unrest

by Haley McLaughlin, Daily Staff Photographer

My point here is that 

this is a made-up world 
of contrived ideas and 

people. 

ILLUSTRATION BY EMILIE FARRUGIA

1

1:47 p.m. on a Wednesday night. You’re 
about to doze off, laid heavily upon your 
twin-sized bed that leaves little room for 

turning in your sleep. Despite the heaviness you feel 
on your eyelids, you begin to feel around in the dark 
for your phone in search of some pre-bedtime enter-
tainment. You hold your phone in your hands, hover-
ing it a safe 10 inches away from your face, and hold 
on tight (mustn’t forget the numerous incidents where 
you dropped it on your face and had to suffer through 
the swelling sensation on your nose in the darkness).

Why is it that this has become the strange bedtime 

routine of our generation?

After tiring through all of your social media, fully 

caught up on how all of those people (whom you care 
for so deeply) are doing, you decide to continue explor-
ing, ignoring the lingering sting behind your tired 
eyes.

It is at this point that you wander into the mysteri-

ous “Explore Posts” section of Instagram, the section 
where you are no longer comforted by the faces of your 
friends and family, but rather subjected to a strange 
compilation of pictures that Instagram believes you 
might be interested in seeing. Why Instagram thinks 
you might like these, you’re not so sure. Maybe these 
are similar to other pictures you’ve liked recently? 
Maybe these are some pictures that your friends have 
been liking? Who cares? You keep on scrolling.

First, you see pictures of friends, and then pictures 

of friends of friends, until finally you’re left with pic-
tures of people you’ve never met and places you’ve 
never gone. At this point, it would make sense to stop. 
Just go to bed — you don’t even know what you’re 
looking at anymore. If only you could see yourself 
— lying there alone in the middle of your small dark 
room, the glow of light from your phone revealing two 
tired eyes and a double chin. But it’s only 12:32 a.m. 
You have time.

It is at this point in the night that things get really 

dismal — because now you’ve come across Instagram’s 
food accounts. It starts with a picture of mac and 
cheese that comes up in your “Explore Posts” section. 
You think to yourself, mm… that looks good, and sud-
denly you become very aware of the sad empty feeling 

in your stomach. Then you decide to torture yourself 
further, clicking on the “food porn” account’s profile 
and looking through all of their pictures. Pizza, cook-
ies, burgers, ice cream, pasta, donuts, it doesn’t end. 
You reach down and lay your hand upon your stomach, 
wondering to yourself, when was the last time I ate? It 
feels like it’s been centuries even though you know it’s 
only been a few hours. You know you should either go 
get a snack or just go to sleep but something is keeping 
you tied to your bed, shuffling through all of these pic-
tures of melting chocolate and grilled cheeses being 
pulled apart.

Your heart is full and your stomach feels emptier 

than it ever has before, and then suddenly you are cat-

apulted out of this swirl of indulgence and joy when 
you see a picture of a skinny 16-year-old girl in a biki-
ni on the beach, who looks like she’s having the best 
damn day of her entire life. Sun-kissed and sparkling, 
her body reminds you of the lean bend of a churro cov-
ered in dazzling cinnamon sugar.

The grumble in your stomach pauses, as your eyes 

dart back and forth between one picture of her per-
fectly flat stomach and the other picture of chocolate 
being drizzled over that disgustingly enticing choco-
late chip cookie. Who is this girl? Why has she come 
here to haunt me and my hungry dreams? You begin 

to spend far too much time searching through 

her pictures. You don’t understand. Does she go 

to school? Does she have a job? Or does she simply 

spend all of her time scantily clad on a beach some-

where?

Soon your jealously for this stranger’s beauty is sud-

denly eating away at the empty feeling that, minutes 
ago, you thought was coming from your stomach. You 
wish you were smiling in the sunshine and wearing 
cool clothes instead of eating an entire bag of Cheetos 
alone in your bed. Your self-worth has all but disap-
peared into thin air and you can’t fall asleep because 
you’re too busy mentally cursing this girl’s name and 
the gods who made her so damn flawless in the first 
place.

Kind of fucked up, right? We’re all jealous of these 

strangers and their seemingly beautiful lives, and yet 
we continue to torture ourselves by looking at them 
and fantasizing about things that we can’t have. It’s 
why people like the Kardashians have 50+ million fol-
lowers on Instagram. That’s more than 50 million peo-
ple watching these strangers taking pictures of their 
bodies and saying, “Try out our new Waist Trainer! If 
you want to look like us, use this healthfully unsound 
device and keep praying that one day your drastically 
unachievable goals will come true!”

And I’m not trying to preach the often-heard tales 

of eating disorders and body dysmorphia that we are 
warned of time and again. While those are severe 
problems that stem from this crazy world we live in 
where people like Chrissy Teigen are “foodies,” I think 
sometimes that only serves to squander the argument. 
My point here is that this is a made-up world of con-
trived ideas and people. Nothing is ever as it seems, 
and yet we care about it so much.

I see people my age struggle for hours to try and cre-

ate the perfect profile picture, or sit around in a room 
bouncing around ideas for the right caption for an Ins-
tagram. We’re all trying to top one another and con-
vince everyone that we are the ones who are the most 
effortlessly beautiful and that we are the ones who had 
the most fun this weekend. Happiness is measured in 
numbers of “likes” and feelings of jealousy and nobody 
will ever win in this game of artificial reality.

One Ring to Rule Them All

by Thomas West, Daily Opinion Columnist

I 

play this video game called “The Elder Scrolls V: 
Skyrim.” I like to think I’m one of the more pow-
erful wizards in the Skyrim. I have all the master 

destruction spells: Fire Storm, Blizzard, Lightning 
Storm. Not to brag, but I’m level 81 and I can raise dead 
bodies to fight for me indefinitely. I can cast Mayhem, 
where my enemies begin fighting one another. I am the 
Arch-Mage of the wizard’s College of Winterhold. I 
wear a flaming Dragon Mask that reduces the cost of 
all destruction magic by 20 percent. I am awesome.

But something holds me back. A 

necessary item I have yet to acquire. 
My white whale. I do not have the 
Ring of Peerless Destruction. I scour 
the mountains of Skyrim for it. I 
slaughter whole villages of bandits 
in my search. But still it eludes me, 
whispering from the dark.

“But Tom,” you ask. “You already 

have all this sick gear, why do you 
need that one ring?”

Shut up. You could not possibly 

hope to understand, you filthy, casual 
muggle. But I will explain. I have the 
Dragon Mask, Nahkriin, that reduc-
es Magicka cost of destruction by 20 
percent. I have dragon bone gloves 
and boots that fortify my destruction 
even further, reducing my Magicka 
costs to 25 percent of the standard 
rate. Try to follow along.

With these items alone I am fear-

some: I can use lightning to roast a 
wooly mammoth to powder in ten 
seconds. But it is not enough: The 
cost of my power is too high. But if I 
had that ring, that simple, innocuous 
ring, the cost of destruction spells 
would be reduced to nothing. Zero 
percent. Don’t you see? How could 
you. Unlimited magic, you fool, lim-
itless power.

It has been my dream since I was 

just a young, hopeful wizard walking 
through the doors of the mage’s Col-
lege of Winterhold for the first time. 
Back when all I could muster was a 
flurry of sparks and the Arch-Mage 
sent me to weed out skeletons in the basement. God, I 
miss those days. The smell of a new Grimoire. Acciden-
tally eating Deathbell in potions class. And of course, 
that young love of mine, Illia.

Oh, Illia. Shall I compare thee to a winter’s day? Your 

ice spells are as magnificent. How I miss your snow-
white skin, your black lips, those cruel, sunken eyes. 
We were perfect for each other, a wizard and his witch. 
I loved you ever since you impaled your own mother 
on an ice spike after she was corrupted by Hagravens. 
Perhaps this is why I’m so sorry for what happened to 
you, my companion, mon amour magique.

We traveled together often. She helped me defeat the 

evil dragon Alduin. It was she who helped me kill the 
dragon priest in possession of the Dragon Mask Nah-
kriin. In many ways, she helped me become the wizard 
tyrant I always knew I could be. Sometimes you just 
needed someone to believe in you. Together we beat all 
of the main questlines. I should have set the controller 

down then.

But then my quest for the ring tore everything apart. 

I am mad for it. Since all the main questlines were 
completed I had nothing to live for — only the ring. 
After discovering the ring was not in the village of 
Rorikstead, I unleash my full repertoire of destruction 
spells on the townspeople. I roasted the butcher with 
Incinerate. I turned the priest into dust. I unleashed a 
demon lord in the daycare.

What had I become? Where was that young and 

hopeful mage who wanted to save Skyrim from the 
tyranny of the Empire? I only had Illia to ground me, 
and now a bounty on my head for the massacre at Ror-
ikstead. The very people of Skyrim whom I had saved 
from Alduin, whom I had fought wars for against the 
Empire, wanted my head on a spike. I would show 
them. Illia and I together, we would find the ring and 
burn Skyrim’s cities to the ground, salting the earth 
behind us.

With his dying breath, the barkeep of the inn at Ror-

ikstead gave me what I wanted: “I’ve caught word of 
a powerful artifact hidden in Ironbind Barrow. You 
should head over there and check it out.”

The fool! He could not have known that his ran-

domly generated quest would cause the extinction of 
his whole kind. Illia and I set off toward Ironbind, an 
ancient Nord tomb in the western reaches.

The tomb is crawling with undead. Skeletons, 

ghosts, those dead thralls known as draugr. Filth. We 

make quick work of them, cutting through, deeper and 
deeper into the tomb. I can hear the ring whispering, 
down, down, somewhere in the shadows.

A dragon priest guards the final chamber. Just past 

him will be a chest, and in that chest a ring. I can feel 
it so strongly. He erupts from his sarcophagus, Vol-
sung, master of destruction, spouting fire, resurrecting 
corpses. I very nearly lose that battle — my Magicka 
had already drained so low. But it is I who reign vic-
torious. I do not even deign to loot his corpse before I 

enter the final chamber.

It is quiet. Ice covers the walls 

and ruined stone beneath that. A 
faint chanting comes from nowhere, 
or perhaps pounding from the chest 
that sits in the center of the room, 
and as I approach it grows louder, a 
hundred voices of the damned say-
ing my name, dovahkiin, dovahkiin, 
dragonborn, dragonborn. 

I lay my hands on the chest and 

open it and the chanting comes to a 
halt and I reach in and pull out what 
lies within, and it is the Iron Boots 
of Weak Improved Health.

I am fuming. Quite literally, my 

body begins to smoke. I am going to 
slaughter Rorikstead all over again. 
I will reanimate every corpse so that 
I may turn them all into dust.

But then I see it. Another chest, 

just off to the side of the chamber, 
made of simple wood and bound 
with iron.

I open it slowly, not wanting to be 

disappointed. Inside are nine gold, 
the Leather Gloves of Improved 
Alchemy, and the Ring of Peerless 
Destruction.

I slip it on and can feel the power 

course up through my hands, 
through the cord and the control-
ler, and into my own fingertips. The 
ring. The ring. The ring.

My most powerful spell is Fire 

Storm. When I cast it, a hundred 
points of fire damage erupts from 
the sky and destroys everything in 

a 20-foot radius. Usually it would drain my Magicka 
completely. But not now. The ring completes me.

I cast one Fire Storm, drawing death from the sky, 

and watch as the ice on the walls shatters and bursts 
into steam. It costs me nothing.

I cast another. And another. Hundreds upon hun-

dreds of points of damage. I am laughing maniacally in 
the game. I am laughing maniacally in real life. Skyrim 
is doomed. We did it, Illia and I. When I am done we 
will be the only ones left.

I turn around to tell her, my queen.
But Illia is not there.
Illia is dead.
My Fire Storm has killed her. She is nothing more 

than a charred corpse, the first victim of my wrath.

Oh Illia! What have I become? The most powerful 

wizard in Skyrim is nothing without you, my sweet 
digital companion.

But it was not too late to save her.

Lessons in uncertainty

by Ian Dillingham, Magazine Editor

I 

am going to Hell, they tell me. Jokingly, with a twinge 
of superiority, friends and neighbors chuckle at the 
thought of my eternal demise. But their words never 

bother me. If there be a Hell, I doubt they decide who pass-
es through the fiery gates.

Oh God, if there be a God, save my soul if I have a soul.
 
 
 
***

Growing up, my community was predominantly Roman 

Catholic. My grandparents on my mom’s side, who lived 
with us for most of my early childhood, were devout 
observers of the faith, and that devotion was passed down 
to my mom. My dad, an atheist, lost the popular vote in 
our household, so I attended private Catholic schools from 
kindergarten to the end of high school. Because I feared 
social repercussions for disobeying teachers and parents, I 
partook in the various religious rites of passage prescribed 
to children in this school system: Baptism, First Reconcili-
ation, and First Communion. But religion was never some-
thing I believed in; it was just something I did. I considered 
the practice on a similar level with doing homework — 
annoying, yet unavoidable.

My grade school — kindergarten through eighth grade — 

was small. Each grade level was composed of about twenty 
students who, for the most part, stayed together for the 
first nine years of their education. Religion was promi-
nently featured in the curriculum, with at least one class 
per day devoted to studying the Catholic Church, at least 
one religious ceremony or tradition marking the schedule 
each week, and at least one (torturous) hour spent in Mass 
each Sunday.

Otherwise, religion was a non-factor in my life. My 

friends and I played violent video games like all the other 
kids. We went to the beach and the movies. We played 
sports (albeit only against other Catholic schools) and 
competed in academic competitions. And, other than those 
couple hours per week in class, religion was never part of 
the discussion.

Things changed when I got to high school. I moved from 

a class of twenty to a class of almost 500. (It was, in fact, 
the largest co-ed Catholic high school in the western Unit-
ed States.) And religion changed from something you did 
to something that defined you. My friends were no longer 
shy in discussing religion or the Church — a product of the 
groupthink mentality that emerges in large, homogenous 
populations. More often than not, I found myself on the 
wrong side of arguments about matters of biblical teaching: 
Did God really flood the entire planet and only save Noah? 
Did Abraham really die at the age of 175? Did Jesus literally 
rise from the dead after three days?

But the debate stemmed from something more than 

logical fallacies. I also found myself on the “wrong” side of 
arguments about matters of faith and spirituality. I came to 
realize that many of my friends — the ones who had rarely 
mentioned faith in the years I had known them — were 
much further down their path of spiritual development 
than they had led me to believe. No longer was I one of the 
crowd; rather, I was the one standing against the crowd. 
The pain of being treated like an outsider in my own com-
munity wore on me until it no longer felt like my commu-
nity.

One Sunday afternoon, after a particularly grueling ser-

mon on the importance of all-encompassing devotion to 
the Church and its teachings, I finally told my mom that 
I wasn’t interested in going to Mass anymore. I officially 
removed myself from the Church, unsure if I might ever 
find my way back.

 
 
 
***

My high school, like my grade school, required students 

to attend regular religious classes. The mandated ninth-
grade curriculum was “Catholic Life Choices.” Our teacher 
— a 30-something, unmarried layperson — was tasked with 
teaching a roomful of walking hormones not to have sex 
or think about sex or even say the word “sex.” She stood 5 
feet tall, wore floor-length dresses and black-framed glass-
es, and alternated between quiet murmuring and bouts of 
screaming. On the best days, the class consisted of chitchat 
and busywork; on the worst days, it involved forced procla-
mations of faith and allegiance to the Church.

During a discussion about spirits one day during the 

middle of the semester, a member of our class asks the 
teacher about Ouija boards, mystical playtoys marketed as 
a means to contact the dead. (Despite such ominous claims, 
they are primarily used by preteens to entertain their 
friends at sleepovers.)

“Are they really possessed by the devil?” the young boy 

asks.

His tone suggests he really just intends to rile the teach-

er and to create a classroom ruckus. The teacher, however, 

calmly addresses the class and says that, in fact, the spirit of 
the Devil can possess such toys. As a preventative measure, 
she suggests that anyone who owns one should bring it to a 
priest to have it exorcised, and she insists that students not 
throw such an item away (lest some residual demons be left 
behind in the garbage can, I suppose).

My ninth-grade self feels nauseated that a paid educa-

tor can suggest to a classroom full of students that a $13.16 
piece of cardboard and plastic manufactured by Hasbro is a 
threat to their safety. Can the makers of Jenga really bring 
Satan into my home?

The next day, I visit the room at lunch to probe the issue 

further.

“Do you really believe a toy could be possessed by the 

devil?” I ask, hoping to reveal some major miscommuni-
cation from class the day prior. Despite my disagreement 
with large portions of the Church’s doctrine, I feel com-
pelled to at least attempt to understand how such beliefs 
arise. Typically, I find the resulting conversations illumi-
nating, and, even though they rarely change opinions, such 
open dialogue is helping me establish my personal creed.

“Well, let me put it this way,” she replies. “Do you believe 

in angels?”

“No,” I reply.
I don’t mean for the answer to come out so bluntly, but 

I can immediately tell she is taken aback. I’m momentarily 
embarrassed, but hardly surprised. Teachers at my school 
are rarely prepared to deal with students who openly ques-
tion the Catholic doctrine, which I have now done by elimi-
nating angels from my worldview.

“Oh, you couldn’t possibly understand what I’m talking 

about then,” she says. “It’s a matter of faith.”
 
 
 
***

For many years now, I have considered myself a religious 

agnostic. I acknowledge that humans have a limited capac-
ity to understand certain aspects of their universe and that, 
try as they might, they cannot obtain absolute or ultimate 
knowledge in any given subject.

Back when my mother still dragged my brother and me 

out of bed for Sunday morning Mass, I was told what to 
wear, what to say, and what to do. The process was repeti-
tive and often brainless. Never was I allowed, as I had 
wished on so many occasions, to raise my hand during a 
homily and to ask the priest to explain further. At first, the 
lack of independent thought was a nuisance. But as I grew 
older, unanswered questions burned inside me. Every time 
I got close enough to someone with “sacred” knowledge, 
the questions only became more intense and troubling.

Since coming to college, I have felt more at ease about 

my lack of religious affiliation. Studies have shown that 
about one-third of college students consider themselves 
secular, compared with about 6 percent among the general 
population. Very few of my friends identify with a religion, 
and those who do often discuss questions of faith openly 
with me if asked. I’ve felt that college promotes a certain 
amount of agnosticism in everyone. Classes in biology and 
chemistry don’t just teach students the nature of science 
but, rather, how to ask the right questions.

I may find faith again one day — faith either in the Cath-

olic Church or in one of the other major or minor religions 
practiced. If agnosticism asks individuals to acknowledge 
uncertainty in life, then I must recognize the possibility 
that religion can be the right path for me. But I will never 
give up my ability to question. To question is to learn, to 
grow and to believe.

T

he first thing I ever wanted to be when I grew up 
was “success.” I was three. 

Before I wanted to be a princess, ballerina, 

fashion designer, writer, “happy,” I wanted to be “success.” 
Perhaps I’d heard my parents studying ESL vocabulary at 
night. Perhaps it convinced them that I should skip pre-K.

I was always the youngest in my class, but I didn’t care 

because I knew what the word “pre-co-shus” meant. Every 
day after school, my friends and I would play Pretend on the 
Thompson Elementary playground. As per usual, Mikayla 
would shout, “I’m the mom!” Erin would ask, “Can I be the 
oldest sister?” Casey would call: “Best friend who’s a model-
artist-actress!”

And I would declare, “I’m 20!”

***

I’m 20. It’s my third year in college and I break the news 

to my friends: I’ll be graduating this May. I tell them that it’s 
the most “fiscally responsible” decision for an out-of-state 
student. I tell them that I have no regrets — I’ve taken all 
the classes I wanted, and really, the biggest disappointment 
is that I can’t get into Rick’s legally before I leave.

They say they’re impressed — impressed that I can be 

financially independent, impressed that I can double major 
in three-quarters the time. I revel in “impressed.” I feel like 
“success.” I become a self-fulfilling prophecy — I complain 
that I’m getting tired of the same 40,000 faces, the same bars 
and small stadium. I’m outgrowing Ann Arbor, impatient to 
start a career in New York where I “belong.”

***

“How old are you, sweetie?” A perky woman knelt down 

to my level in the backstage dressing room.

“Eight,” I chirped. I was five, but I angled the bronzer 

brush deftly on my cheekbones, and I held the eyeliner pen 
without stabbing myself, so she didn’t question me twice.

At age three, I cried before my first dance recital when 

Mommy was nowhere to be found and some random lady 
did my eyeshadow instead. I cried after, when Daddy 
carried me to the car, hissing in my ear, “Big girls don’t cry 
in public.” I learned to do my own eyeshadow like a big girl 
after that.

At 12, I started wearing makeup to school and couldn’t 

wait to be associated with 
the word “teen.” So for 
my 13th birthday, I sent 
for a Seventeen magazine 
subscription. When the first 
issue came, my parents were 
appalled — an early Taylor 
Swift graced the cover, 
pouting in bubblegum pink: 
“The new hookup rules you 
need to know!”

At my first week of 

college, I blew out 18 candles 
of innocence on a cake 
that read, “You’re an adult, 
Karen!” My mom texted me 
the morning after: “What’d 
you 
for 
your 
birthday? 

Where’d you go?”

I 
remembered 
how 

mature I felt the night 
before, red solo cup in hand, 
leading my new friends 
down the street — my legs 
half everyone’s height but 
my pace five-steps ahead. 
The “Boston-walk,” they 

called it, a product of my East Coast upbringing. 

Annoyed, I texted my mom back: “Stop worrying, I’m an 

adult now.”

***

“You talk so fast,” he laughed. “Is that a Boston thing or is 

that just a Millennial thing?”

He sat 16 years my senior and I sat in my Forever 21 dress 

at the five-star seaport restaurant he chose. As he excused 
himself for the bathroom, I rushed to stalk his Instagram, 
scrolling until I hit a #throwback to his high school formal 
circa 1995 — about five months before I was born.

My friend Caroline’s jabbing voice echoed in my head: “I 

would save the 35-year-old until you’re at least 30.”

So I confessed to him: “My friends don’t think I should 

date older men.” He chuckled and shrugged, “Do what you 
want.”

That sure sounded simpler than Caroline’s advice: “You 

aren’t living life at the age you are.”

At his place later, he asked, “How old are you again?”
At 19, I had survived by first summer internship in New 

York; I was paying for a “cultured” apartment all by myself; 
I ate $1 pizza only four times a week. But in that moment, 19 
never held so much shame. I rolled over, catching glimpse of 
a shiny gold band on his nightstand.

“Are you … married?” my voice raised in alarm. He sighed.
“Yeah, my wife and three kids are gonna be home soon … 

So actually you need to leave.” His voice stood stone cold, 
his stare serious — before he broke into laughter, explaining 
how the ring was just a prop from work.

I laughed along, but Caroline’s voice rang again: “You 

don’t have to grow up this fast. Later you’re going to feel 
like you missed out.”

***

After four months of summer apart, Hannah and I 

have finally caught up with everything we’ve missed. By 3 
p.m., we still haven’t moved from her bed, our to-do lists 
neglected in the moment.

“We need to get up and be productive,” I declare.
“OK, you’re right,” she says. “The theme of this year 

will be adulting – to setting limits on partying, to grocery 

shopping instead of eating out, to applying for real jobs.”

“To adulting!” we cheer. Then we cuddle closer, watch 

another rom-com and talk about our celebrity crushes. 
Later, we dance on a balcony to Taylor Swift songs; we jump 
around in a bounce house then blow regrettable amounts of 
money on pizza. 

The next morning, I stare at the U.S. map above her bed, 

decorated with photos of us and our friends. Google says the 
distance from New York to Michigan is a 10 hour drive, or a 
$400 flight. I think about “financial responsibility.”

Even now, when she’s only a 15-minute walk away, I 

tell her, “I can’t tonight, I have this article due.” She can’t 
tonight either, she’s curled up with her boy in the same spot 
I just slept. When we both grow up, will we ever pay $400 
to “can”?

I realize I sound like a 50-year-old at mid-life crisis — and 

I have nowhere near the agency to make the lamentations 
that I do. My life has thus far afforded me privileges — 
and the privilege of making mistakes. But, only now do I 
wish I had listened to Caroline at least a little — learned to 
wear makeup a little later, blown out the birthday candles 
a little less prematurely, relished my remaining time as an 
immature college student a little longer.

As I hurry across the Diag, a student shoves a flier into 

my hand: “Meet your fellow freshmen — party at the rock 
tonight!” More self-conscious than offended, I refrain from 
my usual snarky, “Sorry, I’m a senior.”

Instead, I take the paper, smile and say, “Thanks.”
