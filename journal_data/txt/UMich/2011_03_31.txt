State talks impact

By HALEY GLATTHORN
Daily StaffReporter
In a speech with themes
paralleling her foreign affairs
work as Secretary of State, Con-

doleezza Rice spoke about an
array of nations, from those in
the Middle East to China dur-
ing her lecture on campus yes-
terday.
Rice gave the annual Col-
lege of Engineering Goff Smith
Lecture titled "The Interface
of Energy and Geopolitics,"
discussing topics centered on
the economic and political
implications of the oil indus-
try. Addressing a crowd of sev-
eral hundred people yesterday

afternoon in Rackham Audi-
torium, Rice spoke primarily
about countries that play major
roles in the international oil
market and how they impact
the United States.
Rice served as Secretary of
State under former President
George W. Bush until 2009 and
now works as a professor of
political science and political
economy at Stanford University.
Rice said during her tenure
as Secretary of State, oil prices

began accelerating and at one
point reached a high of $140
per barrel. While this directly
affected gas price and indirect-
ly impacted the availability of
goods in the United States, they
also had a negative effect on
foreign policy, Rice said.
"During that period of time
I said to my colleagues that I
had never seen anything warp
diplomacy like high oil prices,"
she said.

Earthquake in Japan possible
cause of radiation in U.S. milk

FDA says milk is
still below level of
concern and will
drop quickly
WASHINGTON (AP) - Very
low levels of radiation turned up
in a sample of milk from Washing-
ton state, the Environmental Pro-
tection Agency and the Food and
Drug Administration said yester-
day, but federal officials assured
consumers not to worry.
The FDA said such findings
were to be expected in the com-
ing days because of the nuclear
crisis in Japan, and that the levels
were expected to drop relatively
quickly.
Japan's Fukushima Dai-ichi
nuclear power complex began

leaking radiation after it was
damaged by a devastating earth-
quake and tsunami earlier this
month.
Results from a March 25 milk
sample taken from Spokane,
Wash., showed levels of radio-
active Iodine-131 that were still
5,000 times below levels of con-
cern set by the FDA, including lev-
els set for infants and children.
"Radiation is all around us in
our daily lives, and these findings
are a miniscule amount compared
to what people experience every
day," said Patricia Hansen, senior
scientist.at the FDA. "A person
would be exposed to low levels of
radiation on a round-trip cross-
country flight, watching televi-
sion, and even from construction
materials."
EPA said it was increasing the
level of nationwide monitoring of

milk, precipitation and drinking
water.
Spokane, a city of 208,000 resi-
dents, is located more than 300
miles east of the Pacific coast.
Kim Papich, spokeswoman for the
Spokane Regional Health District,
said the agency was aware of the
EPA report and preparing to issue
a statement to residents.
"This is not a major health con-
cern," Papich said.
The United States had already
halted imports of dairy products
and produce from the affected
area of Japan. Other foods import-
ed from Japan, including seafood,
were still being sold to the public
but screened first for radiation.
Japanese foods make up less
than 4 percent of all U.S. imports.
The FDA has said it expected no
risk to the U.S. food supply from
radiation.

Protesters call out
representatives for
bill that would ban
worker strikes
COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -
Labor stronghold Ohio assumed
center stage Wednesday in the
battle over collective bargaining
rights for public workers as the
state Legislature was poised to
send to the governor a bill that
was in some ways tougher than
that seen in Wisconsin.
The measure awaited likely
passage in the Republican-con-
trolled state Senate on yesterday
evening after itearlier cleared the
GOP-led House on a 53-44 vote.
Chants of "Shame on you!"
quickly broke out from onlook-
ers in the House balcony after
the vote there.
About 150 protesters then fil-
tered into the Senate chamber,
singing "We shall not be moved"
and shouting "Power to the peo-
ple!"
Unlike Wisconsin's mea-
sure, the Ohio legislation would
extend union restrictions to
police officers and firefighters.
But the overall response by
protesters in the Rust Belt state,

despite its long union tradition
among steel and auto workers,
has paled in comparison to Wis-
consin, where protests topped
more than 70,000 people. Ohio's
largest Statehouse demonstra-
tions on the measure drew about
8,500 people.
That difference has been
attributed to Madison's labor
legacy and the proximity of the
populous University of Wiscon-
sin campus to the state capital.
Standing in the Ohio State-
house Rotunda after the House
vote yesterday, union steelwork-
er Curt Yarger said he saw the
bill as "a preliminary attack on
working people."
"I shouldn't have any disillu-
sion that I'll be next in the pri-
vate sector," said Yarger, 43, of
Mansfield.
Leo Geiger, a Republican
who works as a sewer inspec-
tor for the city of Dayton and
didn't attend protests because
he couldn't take the time off,
said he's "deathly afraid that this
is going to affect me, my family
and the entire state of Ohio in an
incredibly negative way."
Geiger, 34, called the bill and
the way it has moved through
the Legislature "completely un-
American" and said he believes
it has more to do with "political

payback" than the budget.
"I find this to be loathsome,"
he said last night. "I find this to
be disrespectful to Ohioans and
disrespectful to the process of
Democracy."
Yesterday, an estimated 700
people went to the Ohio State-
house to hear the debate.
The Ohio measure affects
safety workers, teachers, nurses
and a host of other government
personnel. It allows unions to
negotiate wages but not health
care, sick time or pension ben-
efits. It gets rid of automatic pay
increases, and replaces them
with merit raises or perfor-
mance pay. Workers would also
be banned from striking.
Republican Gov. John Kasich
has said his $55.5 billion, two-
year state budget counts on
unspecified savings from lifting
union protections to fill an $8
billion hole. The first-term gov-
ernor and his GOP colleagues
argue the bill would help city
officials and superintendents
better control their costs at a
time when they too are feeling
budget woes.
State Rep. Robert Hagan, a
Democrat from Youngstown,
took issue with the notion that
the bill was aimed at saving
money.

NEWS BRIEFS
EAST LANSING, Mich.
MSU to work with
Commerce Dept.
to increase exports
A new partnership between a
Michigan State University cen-
ter and a federal agency aims to
boost exports from the state.
The East Lansing-based
school on Monday announced
that its International Business
Center would be working with
the Commerce Department's
U.S. Commercial Service.
The school says it's a unique
partnership in Michigan for
fostering economic develop-
ment.
The International Business
Center will conduct market
research and analysis for com-
panies interested in becoming
exporters. The U.S. Commercial
Service will provide internation-
al networking and support.

Mich. strengthens
human trafficking
law enforcement
Amendments intended to
strengthen the existing human
trafficking law take effect on Fri-
day in Michigan, where experts
say the form of modern-day slav-
ery occurs more often than most
people realize.
The new measures include
longer prison terms for involun-
tary servitude, involving a minor
in a sex act and obtaining labor
or services by force, fraud or
coercion.
Bridgette Carr, who directs
the University of Michigan Law
School's Human Trafficking
Clinic, said the practice is hap-
pening all over the state, and
tougher enforcement is needed
to deal with the growing prob-
lem.
OLYMPIA, Wash.
Washington votes
to recognize same-
sex partnerships
t
The state Legislature has
approved a measure that would
make Washington the fourth in
the country to recognize out-of-
state domestic partnerships.
On a 28-19 vote, the Wash-
ington Senate cleared the last
hurdle for the bill, which now
heads to Gov. Chris Gregoire for
a signature.
Under the measure, gay mar-
riages performed elsewhere
would be recognized as domes-
tic partnerships in Washington,
as would domestic partnerships
performed in other states.
Currently, five states, the Dis-
trict of Columbia and Canada
allow same-sex marriages. With
Gregoire's signature, Washing-
ton would become the fourth
state to approve a similar bill,
following Rhode Island, New
York and Maryland.

VIENNA, Austria
Austria to plans
to restore former
concentration camp
Austrian authorities present-
ed plans yesterday to restore and
revamp the former Mauthausen
contentration camp, calling it an
important contribution to pre-
venting the resurgence of Nazi
sentiment.
The Nazis shot, gassed, beat
or worked to death about half
the 200,000 inmates in the main
camp or its affiliates around
the villages of Mauthausen and
Gusen, located near the city of
Linz. It is now a site for com-
memorating Holocaust victims
and learning about the horrors of
history. About 200,000 people -
including many students - visit
Mauthausen each year.
Projects include an exhib-
it about mass extermination,
expanding educational programs
and the creation of a new space
specifically for the remembrance
of those who died, the Interior
Ministry said.

day. According to the article,
the requests ask for all e-mails
from employees working at the
universities' centers on labor
research. Also requested were
e-mails that contain the words
"Madison," "Wisconsin," "Scott
Walker" - Wisconsin's governor
- or "Maddow" - in reference to
MSNBC talk show host Rachel
Maddow, who has reported on
the recent controversy affecting
Wisconsin labor unions.
University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald said the FOIA request
submitted to the University of
Michigan on Monday asked for
e-mails from the University's
Labor Studies Center.
According to the Talking
Points Memo article, a second
request was submitted to the
Douglas A. Fraser Center for
Workplace Issues at Wayne State
University last Friday. A third
FOIA request was sent to Michi-
gan State University's School of
Human Resources and Labor
Relations, the article states.
The records request was filed
by Ken Braun, managing editor
of Michigan Capitol Confidential
- the daily news wire service of
the Mackinac Center.
The FOIA requests to follow
the Wisconsin state Republican
Party's request for the e-mails
of University of Wisconsin Prof.
William Cronon, who publicly
criticized the state's Republican
governor.
The request was intended to
find evidence that Cronon had
violated a Wisconsin law bar-
ring state employees from using
state-funded resources, like
their work e-mail, for partisan
political purposes, according to

a March 25 article in The Chron-
icle of Higher Education.
In several public statements,
the American Association
of University Professors and
American Historical Associa-
tion opposed the effort to obtain
Cronon's e-mails.

Employment, and the Economy,
said the effort in Wisconsin
appears to be an attempt to go
after a professor who spoke neg-
atively about Walker.
"It seems as if what is hap-
pening here in Michigan is bor-
rowed from what is happening in
Wisconsin," Zullo said. "Itseems
to be the case, but we don't know
yet for sure."
According to Mackinac Cen-
ter spokesman Michael Jahr,
Michigan Capitol Confidential
has used the FOIA apolitically,
with several recent stories gen-
erated from or assisted by FOIA
requests.
"The center has used Free-
dom of Information requests
extremely effectively for a num-
ber of years both for research
and analysis and investiga-
tive reporting," Jahr said in an
interview with The Michigan
Daily.
Based on this history, he said
he was surprised people reacted
to the requests without inquir-
ing about the reasons behind it.
Jahr said he didn't anticipate
any public reaction before a
story had been written and was
unsure why other media sources
reported solely on the request for
information.
"I've worked at a number of
media outlets over the years,"
he said. "And it does seem to be
unprecedented - the reactions
and the response."

Jahr refused to comment on
the content or reasoning behind
the FOIA request.
"I won't be able to speak to
the specifics of it until we have
the information and hopefully a
story to go with it," he said.
Fitzgerald said he also thinks
the media coverage is strange.
"I'm as perplexed as any-
one as to why there's so much
media attention being made to a
requestfor information," he said.
"That's unusual. Most of these
things don't happen in the media
spotlight. We don't know what
the record search will show, if
anything, at this point."
Zullo said the tactic of asking
for information from faculty at
a higher education institution is
somewhat baffling to him.
"It is an interesting sort of
political phenomenon for a think
tank to ask for this sort of infor-
mation from faculty at a univer-
sity," he said.
Zullo said there is a level of
discomfort for faculty members
with information being request-
ed in this manner.
"The real risk here is that
e-mail is given out and basically
cherry picked for statements
that will attempt to embarrass
or discredit a faculty member,"
he said.
Zullo added that the work
University faculty members par-
take in is in support of workers'
rights and collective bargaining.
"It's certainly possible to take
some of the messages, pluck
things out of context and have
them used against us in some
way," he said. "And that, I guess,
would be the biggest concern."
Fitzgerald said the recent
request will undergo the same
process as the hundreds of other
requests received by the Univer-
sity each year.

Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi speaks to supporters after crossing the border from Libya into Eqypt by land due to an
embargo on arms and flights in Marsa Matruh, Egypt.
Uganda becomes first nation
to ofer a home for Gadhafi

Action justified
by Libya granting
refuge to Ugandans
in 1970s
NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) - The
list of countries where Moammar
Gadhafi might spend a comfort-
able life in exile is a lot shorter
today than it would have been
in years past because of global
monetary sanctions and possible
trial at the International Crimi-
nal Court.
Uganda's deposed dictator,
Idi Amin, found refuge first in
Libya and eventually in Saudi
Arabia in 1980, living in his own
villa with female companion-
ship, food and drink.
That kind of good life may not
be likely for Gadhafi.
In a twist of fate, Uganda said
yesterday it would accept Libya's
leader, the first country to public-
ly volunteer to give him a home.
Of course, Gadhafi may never
leave Libya unless overbear-
ing military power forces him
to, although world leaders are
hoping the strongman will go,
and there are indications that
his aides are seeking an exit for
a man who has held power for
more than 40 years.
The Uganda president's
spokesman justified the offer of
refuge, saying that Ugandans
were given asylum in neighbor-
ing countries during the rule of
Amin, who killed tens of thou-
sands of his countrymen in the
1970s.

"So we have soft spots for asy-
lum seekers. Gadhafi would be
allowed to live here if he chooses
to do so," spokesman Tamale
Mirundi told The Associated
Press.
Other countries on a list of
potential landing points are
the African nations of Chad,
Mali, Niger, Eritrea and Sudan,
althoughthe first three are mem-
bers of the ICC and would, in the-
ory, be obliged to arrest Gadhafi
if he is charged.
Venezuelan President Hugo
Chavez, who has a long friend-
ship with Gadhafi and has called
for mediation in the conflict,
said yesterday that he has spo-
ken with Gadhafi recently and
that the Libyan leader has no
plans to seek refuge in another
country.
"He has said on different occa-
sions that he isn't going to leave
Libya," Chavez said at a news
conference in Uruguay, where
he was asked whether Venezu-
ela would welcome Gadhafi as an
exile. "I think Gadhafi is doing
what he has to do, no? Resisting
against an imperial attack."
Besides Venezuela, Cuba and
Nicaragua have been openly sup-
portive of Gadhafi, said Mark
Palmer, a former U.S. ambas-
sador and an expert on dicta-
tors. Because the Libyan leader
has a large ego, he is more likely
to accept going to one of those
countries than a smaller African
nation like Eritrea.
Saudi Arabia is an outside pos-
sibility, as is Belarus, which is
led by Europe's last dictator and

was accused of sending weapons
to Gadhafi until an international
arms embargo kicked in.
Some experts cast doubt on
whether Gadhafi would ever
leave Libya.
"I don't think Gadhafi's going
to go anywhere," said Adam
Habib, a political scientist at the
University of Johannesburg in
South Africa. "I think he's happy
to die there."
Italy has been pushing for the
African Union to come up with a
possible place for exile, but Brah-
an Khellaf - the special assistant
to AU commissioner for peace
and security Ramtane Lamamra
- said yesterday that the topic of
Gadhafi's exile has not been dis-
cussed "at all."
Palmer, like many analysts,
said he doesn't believe Gadhafi
will leave Libya voluntarily and
instead must face heavy military
pressure and be given a guaran-
tee he won't end up before the
International Criminal Court,
which opened in 2002.
"He obviously believes he is
Libya, and his family is deeply
entrenched in the power struc-
ture and the wealth of the coun-
try. So I'm sure his family is also
saying 'Don't go, don't go,"' said
Palmer, the author of "Breaking
the Real Axis of Evil: How to
Oust the World's Last Dictators
by 2025."
Palmer said that while Gad-
hafi "richly deserves" to face the
ICC, an international guarantee
that he won't face the court is
a small price to pay to let Libya
proceed in peace.

FROM IRE DAftY
A (non)benefitting bill
Snyder should reconsider unemployment cuts
Michigan has been one of the states most plagued by
unemployment. To make matters worse, Republican
Gov. Rick Snyder is now making the state less friendly
to the unemployed, who comprise 10.4 percent of the state's popu-
lation as of last month. On Monday, Snyder signed a bill into law
that reduced state unemployment benefits to 20 weeks - making
Michigan the only state in the nation to have an insurance period
fewer than 26 weeks. Snyder should reconsider this drastic mea-
sure, which has clear, negative repercussions for the unemployed.

According to a March 28 New York Times
article, the original bill was intended to reduce
unemployment fraud and allow the long-term
unemployed to continue receiving federal
unemployment benefits - up to 99 weeks -
after their state benefits ran out. This technical
change in the law was necessary and beneficial
to Michigan's unemployed. Without it, 35,000
Michigan residents would have become ineli-
gible for continued federal funds next week,
and an additional 150,000 residents would be
added to the list at the end of the year. How-
ever, the reduction of state benefits was slipped
quietly into the bill, which was sold as a mea-
sure to protect the unemployed.
With Michigan's high unemployment rate
- which has stayed above 10 percent since
the end of 2008, longer than any other state -
it's hard to justify this measure that affects a
large portion of the population. Snyder and the
Republican-led State Legislature have an obli-
gation to help the unemployed. This bill risks
driving the unemployed away from the state
before they have the opportunity to get back on
their feet. Thousands of families count onthese
benefits as a vital lifeline. Federal benefits are
helpful for now, since the current 99 weeks of
benefits reflects the difficulty of finding a job
during this time in our nation, but this number
is subject to change. Michigan's reduction to 20

weeks of benefits, however, is permanent.
What's also troubling about this bill is the
quiet way Snyder went about it. The temporary
federal benefits were publicized heavily. The
press release from Snyder's office about the
bill even has a misleading title: "Snyder signs
bill to protect unemployed." The drastic six-
week reduction of state benefits hardly seems
to "protect unemployed." The press release
praises Snyder as a savior to the unemployed,
but fails to mention the reduction of state ben-
efits in any capacity. Advertising only one ben-
eficial part of the bill is a move straight from
the politician's playbook. This is quite a politi-
cal move for Snyder, who campaigned on being
a businessman and not a politician.
Snyder did not need to make these cuts,
and his efforts to not publicize them show his
anticipation of their unpopularity. Spending
cuts in other parts of the budget - for example,
Michigan's inflated corrections spending -
should have been considered before targeting
the unemployed.
This bill sets a dangerous precedent for the
country. Currently, Florida lawmakers ;are
working on a similar bill to become the second
state with a 20-week unemployment insur-
ance period. Michigan needs to be a welcoming
place for all people to live and help the unem-
ployed ratherthan cut their benefits.

Two weeks ago, I tried to
write a column on the deba-
cle surrounding Republi-
can Gov. Rick
Snyder's selec-
tion as the Uni-
versity's Spring
Commencement,
speaker. Every-
one I talked ;
to agreed that
it was the hots
topic, and sub- JEREMY
sequently, my LEVY
best option. But
I found that I
had no strong opinion on the issue.
Both sides of the argument were
logical - honoring someone who
dramatically cut the University's
budget versus honoring the state
governor and three-time Univer-
sity grad - but even more so, I had a
nagging feeling that this was not an
issue that dramatically affected the
student body, aside from the seniors
who were actually graduating.
And here we are now - Snyder
has been approved by the Univer-
sity's Board of Regents, and the issue
is pretty much dead except to those
whose graduation is approaching. It
certainly wasn't a topic that I antici-
pated occupying the opening of this
week's column.
I suspect that many people will
disagree that the Snyder selection
was only a marginal issue, so if you
do, momentarily set that opinion
aside and hear out my larger point.
Our public discourse at all levels -
national, state, local - swarms to
hot button issues that don't neces-
sarily hold long-term significance.
Obviously the average person is more
interested in Charlie Sheen than,
say, state budgets. Yet, an often-
overlooked problem is that when we
do pay attention to public issues, we
tend to focus on the wrong issues, or
the wrong aspects of them.

For instance, many analysts are
arguing that the current budget
debate (President Barack Obama's
freeze on non-discretionary spend-
ing, Wisconsin, etc.) is much too
narrow and does not even touch
the largest budget sectors - Medi-
care, Social Security and military
spending. In this case, the entire
manner in which political discourse
is framed misses a large portion of
the issue. Another related problem
is when important issues receive
so much media coverage that the
extraneous aspects of the story
dwarf the substantial aspects. I'd
say the best recent example is the
WikiLeaks coverage, in which the
most popular articles were those
concerning diplomatic gossip.
There are multiple sources that
influence what the public tends to
discuss. Politicians influence dis-
course based on what issues they
choose to campaign on or speak
about publically, and they frequent-
ly have elections in mind when they
make such decisions. This is why
health care was always about death
panels or a government takeover
and why Obama could campaign
on vague slogans like "Hope" and
"Change" and win. Media sources
that are facing new problems fol-
lowing the economic crisis have
incentives to amplify these tenden-
cies, concentrating coverage on the
most attention-grabbing stories.
Although people technically have
access to unlimited information,
only a few groups such as Google,
CNN, Fox or NBC tend to make the
decisions that determine what peo-
ple actually consume in the end.
The trick, though, is that the
important information is out there.
And learning how to find it is a skill.
Even though cable shows and the
top of your Google news bar provide
everylast detail ofbreakingnews on
one issue, you can find nuanced arti-

cles on long-term issues in reputable
weekly magazines. And when news
outlets put the most inflammatory
stories in easily accessible places on
theirwebsite, the same outlets often
have other substantial pieces that
you have to dig for. Furthermore,
news can only get you so far. Lots of
essential analysis on public issues
comes from books and studies done
by scholars. Yet, in the book market,
the best-selling novels come from
politicians who are running in the
upcomingelections.
Our public
discourse tends
to be too narrow.
Back to Snyder. This column is
about the type of political discourse
and news we are often fed, and how
we can react to it. When Snyder was
first announced as speaker, there
was an unspoken student consensus
that he was the most potent issue of
the moment. Two weeks later, it's
even clearer to me than before that
he was not. In the long run, who is
selected as the graduation speaker
at the University is a shallow politi-
cal issue, and it's a problem if that's
the only story that peaks the inter-
est of the average student.
But even if you do think that the
graduation speaker is asalient issue,
it's only one example. It's necessary
for us to realize how politicians and
news outlets frame our public dis-
course in a broad sense, so we can
avoid narrow and misguided dis-
cussio'ns.

TEDDY PAPES [
A monument to hubris

It's a safe bet that many college students are
tired of the standard left-versus-right political
battles that somehow never seem to lead to any
substantive change. Even more disappointing
is the sad reality that politicians we support,
whether Democrat or Republican, all too often
fail to live up to the principled promises made
on the campaign trail.
Though it's a sales pitch you've likely heard
before, former New Mexico governor and 2012
presidential candidate Gary Johnson really is a
different type of politician - and he just might
represent the new, bold face of the nation's
political discourse. The University's chapter
of College Libertarians and Students for a Sen-
sible Drug Policy are teaming up to bring John-
son to campus Thursday evening, and if you
haven't heard of him yet, you're going to like
what you learn.
Even a cursory glace at Johnson's life reveals
that, despite his successes in public office, he
simply isn't cut out for the role of suit-wearing
bureaucratic windbag. An independently suc-
cessful businessman, Johnson seems more
comfortable out of the office. His interests
include relaxing, soothing outdoor activities
like competing in Ironman Triathlons and
scaling Mount Everest (as he did successfully
in2003). Clearly, somethingsets Johnson apart
from your run-of-the mill politico.
Yet a compelling personal life is not enough
to mark an individual as a skilled and effective
leader. Fortunately, Johnson's record speaks
for itself. Elected governor of New Mexico
in 1994 as a Republican, Johnson led without
regard for party orthodoxy. His aggressive,
reform-oriented platform proved popular with
New Mexico residents, and Johnson left his
state with a large budget surplus after his term-
limited tenure as governor ended in 2003.
When in power, Johnson didn't simply
settle into his position as New Mexico's chief
executive and let the prominence of his office
scare him into a politically convenient silence.
Instead, he used the governor's office as a plat-
form to express his controversial views on
issues of national importance.
Take, for example, the issue of marijuana
legalization. Johnson hasn't taken the easy
path of avoiding the issue entirely or sheepish-
4

ly calling for a review of our current marijuana
policies "some time in the future," as all too
many politicians have done. Rather, he believes
that cannabis should be fully legalized for use
by responsible adults and has repeatedly stated
that the War on Drugs has been a costly failure.
To back up his convictions, Johnson serves as a
national board member for Students for a Sen-
sible Drug Policy.
The War on the Drugs isn't the only forceful
intervention Johnson has bravely challenged.
Johnson publicly opposed the Iraq War despite
his affiliation with the Republican Party and
has more recently spoken out against the Unit-
ed States's involvement in Libya, rightly recog-
nizingthat "we are once again just playing cop
to the world" when we have no right to militar-
ily intervene in affairsbeyond our borders.
And Johnson has plenty to offer both civil
libertarians and champions of the free market
as well. Johnson's libertarian view of a lim-
ited government recognizes that you and you
alone are best able to make your own decisions
and that responsible adults do not need the
government to assume the role of nanny. He
has spoken out against the privacy-invading
Patriot Act, defended a woman's right to seek
an abortion and combated the sentiment that
immigrants, legal or illegal, should be treated
as second-class members of our society. Fur-
ther, as a self-made man, Johnson understands
the need to allow entrepreneurs to flourish in a
truly free market that rewards innovation and
drive, not political influence.
It's no secret that the American political
process has a tendency to disappoint the ideal-
istic, but it doesn't have to be that way. Before
your cynicism gets the best of you and you slip
into a life of political apathy, listen to what
Gary Johnson has to say. His refreshing hon-
esty and willingness to tackle the controversial
issues that impact our generation are desper-
ately needed today.
Gary Johnson will be speaking at a free
event on Thursday, March 31 at 8 p.m. in the
Michigan League Ballroom.
Written by LSA senior Graham Kozak on behalf
of the University's chapter of College Libertarians
and Students for a Sensible Drug Policy.

On March 3 it was the 86th anniversary of Mount
Rushmore, and it's really 86 too many. It's a monument
that is iconic for the United States and negatively repre-
sents the nation we live in. On land that was stolen from
the Native Americans, a beautiful mountain was turned
into a superficial homage. In a misguided attempt to
instill pride in a nation full of both good and bad, the U.S.
ignored its faults and constructed this monument. It suc-
ceeds only in glorifying our leaders as if they were unerr-
ing gods and fails to constructively explore our past.
The land that Mount Rushmore occupies was origi-
nally belonged to the Lakota Native Americans. The
Treaty of Fort Laramie, which the U.S. signed in 1868,
granted the territory to the Lakota, but as with most of
our treaties between natives and the U.S., it didn't work
out too well for the natives. Less than a decade later, the
U.S. launched an offensive war to capture the territory
because the Lakota refused to hand it over - it's now a
part of South Dakota.
As if this crime wasn't enough, 50 years later the
U.S. commissioned a sculptor to deface a remarkable
mountain with the leaders who represent the nation
that stole the land from its rightful residents. The
Lakota called the mountain "Six Grandfathers," but
the U.S. decided to name it Rushmore after a New York
lawyer. Seems fitting enough?
True to this chauvinism, the sculptor who was com-
missioned for the monument, Gutzon Borglum, was
an active member of the Ku Klux Klan. It seems white
supremacy was the mentality flowing through the ter-
ritory around this time. Construction commenced,
and the four busts were finished, but Borglum died
during its construction. His son took over the project,
but funding was cut before it was finished. If you look
closely you can see that the monument is incomplete
as the chests of each president were supposed to be
included. It also seems that they didn't have enough
money to clean up the site as a massive pile of rubble
remains under the faces and has yet to be removed.
If the practical aspects of Mount Rushmore weren't
disreputable enough, the political message is equally

shameful. An inherent problem with this monument is
that politicians are divisive figures. Abraham Lincoln
violated many principles of our nation and constitution
to fight the Civil War, a conflict which many people are
still bitter about. Teddy Roosevelt was a volunteer in
the Spanish American war, one of our most embarrass-
ing foreign policy endeavors, and was president during
U.S. imperialism in the Philippines. Wherever people
stand on these issues is not the point, but it's impor-
tant to understand that these figures have complex and
even controversial histories. Mount Rushmore doesn't
ask any questions or recognize the potential faults of
these men. Instead, it asks you to worship them.
If an American were to see a sculpture of Democrat-
ic People's Republic of Korea leader Kim Jong-il's face
in the side of a mountain, it would be justly and imme-
diately decried. Such a monument does nothing to
highlight a complexity of issues and seeks only to rep-
resent leaders as all-powerful, mighty and infallible.
Deification of our forebears is already a fait-accompli,
but to extend this to Lincoln and Roosevelt does noth-
ing to help our country grow and learn from history.
There has even been buzz about Ronald Reagan's face
being put on Mount Rushmore, which hopefully won't
happen anytime soon. Fifty years from now though,
people may forget his scandals and his bust maybe tak-
ing its place with the others. Make no mistake, we will
be worse off for it.
Dynamiting Mount Rushmore may not be a bad idea,
but it could send the wrong message. I've thought about
it quite a bit, and I think it should stay. But instead of
a monument to supremacy, it should be a monument to
the past and our excessive pride. It shows how the U.S.
can forget that it makes mistakes and that it has made
a lot of them. This defaced mountain should be the
last homage of its kind, and what we should take away
from its permanence is that we must always be vigilant
of ourselves. Rather than facilitating idolatry, Mount
Rushmore should be a relic of our hubris.

State.
For Brandon, it was money
well spent.
"It's a big job with a lot of
expectations, and we feel very
good about how much we're
compensating him to help us
reach those expectations,"
Brandon said in an interview
with The Associated Press.
He later added: "The eco-
nomics were worked out in
minutes - not hours or days. It
was quick, easy and stress-free,
but it took several weeks to get
done because we let the lawyers
do their work with the contract
language."
Hoke was a defensive line
coach under Lloyd Carr in
2002, and he led Ball State to an
astounding 12-1 record in 2008
- the Cardinals were a 5-7 squad
just two seasons before.
He then made the transition
to San Diego State after the 2008
season and guided the Aztecs to
an 8-4 record in 2010. The team
beat Navy in the Poinsettia Bowl
on Dec. 23, and Hoke helped put a
second football program back on
the map.
But when Michigan came
calling in January, there was no
doubt Hoke would end up in Ann
Arbor<
"The University offered (my
wife) Laura and I an opportunity
to coach at Michigan, and that's
been my dream," Hoke said.
"Nothing will change my focus."
At his introductory press con-
ference, Hoke said there was "no
doubt" he would coach at Michi-
gan forever. But if his contract
were to be terminated without
cause, his buyout would pay him
more than Rodriguez was paid
after he was fired.
RESEARCHERS
From Page 1A
of Psychiatric Research: Genomes
and Neural Circuits." The paper,
which was published in March
2010 in Science magazine, out-
lines two types of research that
are crucial,td increasing scientific
understanding of common neuro-
psychiatric conditions.
According to the paper, there
have been no major break-
throughs in schizophrenia treat-
ment in 50 years and no major
breakthroughs in depression
treatment in 20 years. Addition-
ally, drugs developed in the last
few decades to treat depression
only work for a subset of the pop-
ulation.
Akil and her co-authors wrote
that understanding these illness-
es is a large endeavor due to the
complexity of neural circuits and
the thousands of genes involved
in neural development. The root
cause of mental illness also differs
between amongindividuals.
Stanley Watson, the other
co-director of the University's
MBNI, compared a mental illness
to a fever, saying that it is neces-
sary to find the specific underly-
ing cause in order to treat the
condition.
"There are over 200 ways
you can get cough and fever in a
human ... so your treatment for an
allergyis differentthanfor a(bac-
terial) infection," Watson said.
. "The real Holy Grail is precision
about the illnesses ... by knowing

the pathways, then you've got a
shot at beginning to deduce what
to do."
Watson said it is important to
understand of the specific factors
causing a person's illness, so that
doctors can determine the best
treatment options.
Watson, who is Akil's hus-
band, also pointed to research in
genomics - the study of genes
and the mechanisms they con-
trol - and neural circuitry as the
areas that will improve under-
standing of these illnesses.
Margit Burmeister, a research
professor in the MBNI, said with
recent progress beingmade in the
fields of genetics, and genomics
as well as in bioinformatics and
statistics, it is now possible to do
genetic testing on tens of thou-
sands of people and on millions
of gene variants to "tease out"
genetic factors influencing men-
tal illness.
The most well known genetic
factor in the onset of mental ill-
ness is the serotonin transporter
gene, Burmeister said. This gene
is involved in recycling serotonin
- a neurotransmitter that con-
tributes to a person's happiness
- after it has been secreted into

RICE
From Page 1A
Rice outlined the energy per-
spectives of Russia, Venezuela
and the Middle East - three of
five major oil exporters to the
United States. Russia is currently
a "commodities giant," brim-
ming with emerging industries
that may eventually lead the
Russian economy away from the
oil market, Rice said. Currently,
80 percent of Russia's exports
are commodities, mostly related
to oil and gas, she said.
"(In) Russia you have a sig-
nificant marriage of politics, per-
sonal fortunes, political rivals,
statism and therefore an econ-
omy that is based more on 19th
century principles than 21st cen-
tury principles," Rice said.
Countries like Russia expe-
rience what Rice called "the
resource curse" - a phenomenon
that occurs when oil exporters
avoid diversifying their econo-
mies. Rice said that Middle East-
ern oil giants such as Iraq and
Kuwait are even better examples
because they are characterized
by excessive reliance on oil to

support their economies.
"(This dependence) is very
volatile," Rice said. "... It's not a
good thingto be so dependent on
these countries."
Rice also discussed the role
of energy dependents like the
United States and China, which
has foreign policies linked to its
oil access. Though China's econ-
omy has experienced significant
growth in recent years, Rice said
the country's vast development
has made it increasingly oil-
dependent.
"You can be absolutely certain
that the Chinese are never going
to do anything in their foreign
policy - no matter how impor-
tant to us or to anybody else in
terms of stability - that affects
their access to the oil and gas
that they need to fuel their econ-
omy," Rice said.
Any type of international
energytreaty is unlikelyto mate-
rialize in the coming decades
because such an agreement
would be unsuccessful, Rice said.
Though many Americans
believe China will soon surpass
the United States as a world
superpower, Rice said China has
other concerns it must address

before any real shift in the
international balance of power
occurs. These issues include
recent episodes of civilian dis-
sent, which contradict the Chi-
nese government's claims of
having a "harmonious society,"
Rice said.
Similarly, the United States
may face its greatest threat from
within its borders due to prob-
lems surrounding immigration
law and unequal educational
opportunities that may hinder
the country from moving for-
ward, she said.
Andrea Olive, an adjunct assis-
tant professor in the Program in
the Environment at the Univer-
sity, said though she enjoyed the
lecture, Rice ignored aspects of
the oil trade that are closer to
home.
"I'm sort of surprised that
there wasn't more discussion
about dependence on oil from
Canada and the major environ-
mental ramification that's hap-
pening in these two countries,"
Olive said. "This whole deci-
sion to move away from foreign
dependence has meant turning
to Canada, which is still a foreign
country."

Head coach Brady Hoke advises running back Stephen Hopkins during a prac-
tice on Tuesday, March 29.

Rodriguez left Michigan with
$2.5 million in buyout money
- Hoke would get $3 million if
he was fired following the third
year of his contract.
And while there are vast dif-
ferences in the structure of
Hoke's contract compared to
Rodriguez's, Hoke's average sal-
ary might end up being higher
than his predecessor's. Rodri-
guez earned $2.5 million per
year during his three-year ten-
ure.
The contracts had similar ter-
mination with cause provisions,
as both state that the coach's
contract could be terminated for
violating NCAA, Big Ten confer-
ence or University rules.
Like Rodriguez, Hoke will
be entitled to the best available
tickets for Michigan athletic

events. He will also be allotted
an exclusive private viewing
box for all home football games,
which may be used to host fam-
ily, friends, donors or for busi-
ness purposes.
In the contract, the Universi-
ty agreed to pay San Diego State
$1 million to satisfy the buyout
terms of Hoke's contract with
the Aztecs.
Hoke's agent Trace Arm-
strong handled the specifics of
the deal with the University,
allowing Hoke to prepare for the
team's spring game on April 15
and its opener against Western
Michigan on Sep. 3.
"My focus has been on the
football program and will con-
tinue to be on making this pro-
gram the best in America," Hoke
said.



the synapse, or the space between
neurons. Studies have shown that
a certain variant of the serotonin
transporter gene affects how peo-
ple react to stress.
Srijan Sen, an assistant profes-
sor in the University's Depart-
ment of Psychiatry, studied the
effects of the serotonin transport-
er gene in 740 medical students
working in 13 hospitals across the
country. To do this, he sequenced
the DNA of the students and then
monitoredtheir depression symp-
toms during their first years of
residency, which is considered
to be the most stressful time in
a medical student's career. Pub-
lished last June, Sen found that
during residency, students with
the less functional version of
the serotonin transporter gene
experienced more symptoms of
depression.
Though the evidence sup-
porting the link between the
serotonin transporter gene and
mental illness is strong, Burmeis-
ter noted that because genes work
together, one gene alone doesn't
have a major impact on a per-
son's susceptibility to psychiatric
disorders. Therefore, Sen is now
looking at hundreds of genes that
could have also affected the men-
tal health of the medical students
in the study, Burmeister said.
Watson said successful genom-
ics research requires more than
mere identification of the genes
involved in an illness. When it
comes to treatment, it's very dif-
ficult to develop a drug that tar-
gets a specific gene, he said. Thus,
in order to understand and treat
mental illness, it is necessary to
explore the other half of genom-
ics research, which involves the
actual physical processes that
genes code for, Watson said.
However, genomics is not the
only method available to explain
and combat psychiatric disor-
ders, Burmeister said.
"This idea that if something
is genetic it's deterministic is
a misconception that we have
to get over, because saying that
genes are involved in depres-
sion does not necessarily mean
that someone who has certain
genetic variants is doomed to
become depressed," Burmeister
said. "It just means that under
certain circumstances, he or she
may have to do certain things
to help alleviate it, but it's not
unchangeable."
A person's genetics impact the
brain, but so do the drugs he or
she takes and the environment
the person lives in, Burmeister
said. This brings in the second
area for understanding mental
illness: neural circuitry.
The brain, especially with
physical structures associated
with memory or stress, can

rewire itself, Watson said. The
brain of a person with post-trau-
matic stress disorder changes
slightly as a result of repeatedly
remembering an event, he said.
"It might be just a matter of
learning too strongly what the
event was," Watson said. "Some-
times the startled nature of a
trauma is as fully important as
what the trauma was, and the
combination is really horrible."
Some PTSD treatments aim
to undo this rewiring by hav-
ing patients remember the event
under non-traumatic conditions
or with medication. Similar to
depression, there could be a
precipitating factor that drives
the initial depressive episode
of PTSD, Watson said. Over
time, the episodes occur more
frequently, indicating that the
brain has rewired toward the ill-
ness, and the person has essen-
tially learned to be depressed.
Akil and her co-authors
highlight some methods for
understanding complex neural
networks such as brain imag-
ing and noninvasively shutting
off different neurons in a neural
circuit in the brain and observ-
ing the effects.
John Greden, executive direc-
tor of the University's Compre-
hensive Depression Center, said
in addition to genomics and
brain imaging, sleep research is
key to understanding mental ill-
nesses. People struggling with
depression often have abnormal
sleeping habits that exacerbate
episodes of depression, he said.
"Sleep is probably the most
predictable variable that chang-
es when people get depressed,"
Greden said. "In other words,
most people with depression
have alterations or unpleasant
things happen with their sleep."
Research at the Depression
Center has revealed that moni-
toringthe brain waves of adoles-
centgirls as theysleep canreveal
abnormalities in their brains
that may make them vulnerable
to depression, Greden said. He
added that this is a finding that
could lead to earlier detection
and treatment of depression.
Greden said he thinks new
personalized treatments that
combine psychotherapy, brain
stimulation and nutritional
awareness to combat mental
health issues will develop in the
next three to five years.
Watson's view is that develop-
ing a scientific methodology to
treat mental illnesses will take a
few more decades.
"I think you're looking at
a 20-year horizon," he said.
"That's not so difficult to con-
ceive of anymore. That number
is actually built on real calcula-
tions."

LOWRY
From Page 1A
will serve for many as a portal to
the past.
With 35 children's books under
her belt, Lowry continues to write
from her home in Cambridge,
Mass. Though best known for her
two Newbery Medal novels, "The
Giver" and "Number the Stars,"
Lowry has also written a range of
other books, including her latest,
"Bless This Mouse," which came
out on March 21.
In an interview with The
Michigan Daily, Lowry said she
is looking forward to her visit to
Ann Arbor, though she wants to
keep the content of her lecture
under wraps. Her talk is titled "In
the Dreamworld, It Doesn't Mat-
ter."
"This particular title comes
from an incident in my not-too-
distant past with those words
having been said," Lowry said.
"And so I thought they lent them-
selves to a talk about imagination
and all that stuff that goes into a
dream world."
Lowry makes her return to
Ann Arbor after an earlier post as
writer-in-residence in the Resi-
dential College. The experience
of living in East Quad is one the
author will always remember.
"At one point I hung a hand-
written sign on my door in the
middle of the night that said, 'Out

of the respect for the extremely
elderly person trying to sleep in
this room, can you keep the noise
down,' " Lowry said. "Besides
from that, it was a very pleasant
experience."
Thoughhername mightroll off
many students' tongues, Lowry
had no idea her career would end
up as it has. As a photographer
and freelance journalist in the
1970s, Lowry caught the eye of an
editor at Houghton Mifflin who
suggested that she write a chil-
dren's book.
"They perceived that I was
someone who was able to look out
of the eyes and perceptions of a
child," Lowry said. "A lot of writ-
ers - evenvery successful writers
for adults - are not able to write
for kids. It is because they don't
have that particular capacity to
put themselves back into the per-
ceptions of a child. And for some
reason, that's easy and comfort-
able for me."
Lowry found tremendous suc-
cess in this endeavor, particularly
in writing fiction novels.
"I think fiction is a good way -
this is true for anyone of any age
- of rehearsing what you haven't
experienced yet," Lowry said. "If
you move alongthroughthe read-
ing of a book - identifying with
the main character - facing what
the main character does, ina way
you're rehearsing for how you
will deal with those things when
you face them yourself later on."

Lowry's works often contain
material that some might deem
too sophisticated for her audi-
ence, diving into complex issues
such as terminal illness, utopian
societies, racism and the Holo-
caust. Yet, her writing resonates
with the reader.
"If a book is good, it doesn't
hit a kid over the head with
'Issues' with a capital 'I' or
'Problems' with a capital 'P,' "
Lowry said. "It simply tells a
good story, which is something
that is intrinsic to us."
Lowry explained that she
enjoys problem-solving just as
much as the characters in her
stories do. Though she admits
that more intense books become
draining to write after a while,
the thought process is enriching.
" 'The Giver,' the two books
that follow it and the fourth one
that I'm writing now, fall into a
vague category - some people
call it fantasy or soft science fic-
tion," Lowry said. "Those are fun
to do because they require specu-
lation on my part and an element
of magical realism."
Taking on the role of the main
character in her best-known
work, Lois Lowry herself will be
the "giver" of wisdom today as
she helps foster interest in chil-
dren's literature on campus.
"Writing for kids has proven
to be so satisfying for me that I
(haven't) written for adults for
some years," Lowry said.

Freshmen elevate expectations in playoffs

By CASANDRA PAGNI
Daily Sports Writer
After Michigan's NCAA West
Regional draw against Nebraska-
Omaha, senior forward Louie
Caporusso said that in order for
Michigan to make it to the Fro-
zen Four in St. Paul, Minn. the
younger Wolverines would need
to mask their youth.
"Your freshmen have to play
like they're not freshmen," Capo-
russo said early last week. "That's
the key if you want to win. And
the seniors have to play like pro
hockey players. Everyone's got
to up their game, they've got to
leave their comfort zone. That's
how you win games, getting out of
your comfort zone."
And now that they've made it
to St. Paul, the Wolverines are set-
ting even higher expectations for

their younger players.
In last weekend's NCAA
regional matchups against
Nebraska-Omaha and Colorado
College, No. 2 Michigan played
two freshmen forwards - Luke
Moffatt and Derek DeBlois - and
three freshmen defensemen -
Jon Merrill, Mac Bennett, and
Kevin Clare.
Now, with two NCAA Tourna-
ment victories under their belts,
the underclassmen have not only
gotten a taste of the playoff atmo-
sphere but are ready to make
these victories contagious.
"It's kind of wild, but now that
we're here, this is what we expect
the rest of the way," Bennett said.
"The rest of my three years, if we
don't make it to the Frozen Four,
it's a disappointing season."
Added Merrill: "It's pretty
crazy, it's pretty lucky. Some of

the other guys were talking how
spoiled we were to come in as
freshmen and go to the Frozen
Four right away. It's pretty awe-
some."
While Michigan's seniors are
the only class to have made a Fro-
zen Four appearance on the cur-
rent roster, the 5-4 overtime loss
to Notre Dame in 2008 has been
used as motivation to help pre-
pare the younger Wolverines for
the game - potentially two games
- ahead.
The freshmen know every part
of the game is under a microscope
during the Frozen Four, and that
they will need to find a way to
make their play virtually flawless.
As Caporusso alluded to on
Selection Sunday, each player
needs to elevate his individual
game, regardless of prior experi-
ence, for Michigan to have a col-

lective chance.
"Once we hit the playoffs,
there's less room for error," Mich-
igan coach Red Berenson said.
"I need to be able to trust them
when they're on the ice, that they
can be responsible defensively,
that they're not going to get out
muscled or out hustled. I'm not
worried about if they score or not,
I want to make sure they don't'
get scored against and they know
exactly what they're doing out
there, that's huge.
"They can walk around and
their eyes are like, 'Oh, wow.' Well
never mind the wow factor, let's
get over that and play the game."
Merrill and Bennett have
locked down spots on defense, but
Clare, Moffatt, DeBlois and soph-
omores Lindsay Sparks and Jeff
Rohrkemper are fighting for the
last remaining lineup spots, even

at this point in the season.
While the Frozen Four isn't
an ideal time to have to wonder
whether or not they'll be on the
ice, the level of competition this
uncertainty has brought out in
the freshmen in the week leading
up to St. Paul is a good thing.
"Really, I need to trust them,"
Berenson said. "That they can
play the game at this time of year
against this type of competition
and not hurt our team. And they
should play well, that's why we
brought them to Michigan, but in
the meantime, that's the bottom
line."
Leading up to the Frozen Four,
most seniors have tried to convey
to their younger teammates how
special the experience truly is.
From a Frozen Four loss in 2008
to two consecutive NCAA region-
al and regional final exits, the

seniors are taking their last crack
at a national title seriously - and
making sure the rest of the Wol-
verines do as well.
"(The seniors) said they were
there when they were freshmen,"
Merrill said. "And they ended
up losing the first game there.
But something like this is some-
thing that doesn't come around
often, so really take advantage of
it. Before you know it, you'll be a
senior too."
Added Bennett: "Everyone
just says, 'Be ready.' With play-
off hockey, I don't think it mat-
ters what level you're playing at,
everyone steps it up. We saw that
this weekend, we saw that in the
CCHA playoffs. You've just got
to be ready to play every night
and you've got to give it your all
because you never know which
shift could be your last."

open to the media, it appeared
Washington was running with the
first-team defense. Despite a disap-
pointing beginning to the five-star
recruit's Michigancareerhe seems
to be makingstrides this spring.
."Will Campbell is showing signs
at times of being the guy that comes
off the football like we want him to,
and then there's other times when
he doesn't," Mattison said.
"Now, he's like everybody else
and we've got to be more consistent
doing it, play after play," he added.
"I've been real excited with those
guys, the size inthere, the strength
in there and them coming off the
ball. It just has to be more consis-
tent."
Teaching guys like Campbell
has been rewarding so far, Mat-
tison said explaining that when he
corrects a player, he usually doesn't
see the same mistake the next day.
But, the unit still has work to do
to get to where Mattison wants it
to be.
"The entire defense has tons of
work to do on basic techniques,"
Mattison said. "But I would've said
that about any team that I've had
because unless they're perfect with
their technique, I'm not satisfied.
This group has to work very, very
hard on just basic, steps, punch,
blow delivery, those kind of things
- the very integral parts of being
that kind of a player."
Then, the ringswill come.
"I assume that any Michigan
player has rings," said Mattison,
who made his son dig up Mat-
tison's Rose Bowl ring when he
took the defensive coordinator job
at Michigan. "Our goal is to get
more of those."

Daily Sports Editor
Physically, Cam Gordon didn't
look much different during prac-
tice on Tuesday afternoon.
He was the same athletic,
6-foot-3, 207-pound specimen
that received a load of hype this
time last year during spring prac-
tice. And he looked just as he did
when he put an exclamation point
on the beginning of the 2010 sea-
son by blocking a field goal in the
first quarter against Connecticut.
Yet, there stood Gordon as an
outside linebacker in Greg Mat-
tison's 4-3 scheme, playing with
what appeared to be the first-
team defense - his fourth dif-
ferent position since coming to
Michigan, having already played
at wide receiver, safety and Rich
Rodriguez's hybrid linebacker
position last season. Mattison
said Wednesday that Gordon had
made the most progress of anyone
during the first six spring prac-
tices.
"I really, really have high hopes
for him," Mattison said. "This
is a guy that played safety obvi-
ously, that now is playing a SAM
linebacker up on the line, play-
ing against tight ends. This guy, I
think has a chance to be a pretty
good football player and has a
tremendous attitude, wants to do
everything right. He runs to the
football. He's very physical ... I
think he's a kid you're going to see
a lot of."
When Gordon was moved from
safety to the hybrid linebacker
position before Michigan's game
against Penn State, it was viewed
as advantageous having him clos-
er to the line of scrimmage. Rodri-
guez could get creative in how he
used his athletic abilities. Gordon
finished the 2010 season with 77
tackles, 3.5 tackles-for-loss, three
interceptions, four pass break-
ups and two fumble recoveries,
including one for a touchdown

against Purdue.
"Believe me, Cam's areallylong
way away," Mattison said. "But as
a coach, you see things ina young
man, you say, 'This guy really
could be one of those really good
players some day.'
"You're talking about a safety
that has never lined up on a guy
this close away and now he's in
there every day battling with guys
a lot bigger than him. His aggres-
siveness and his toughness really
stand out and he's always been
able to run."
Mattison would like to see Gor-
don get bigger, but with one stipu-
lation.
"I'd like to see as big as he can
get - as big as he can get and still
run," Mattison said.
When guys come up to Matti-
son and ask where he wants them
to be, he tells them all the same
thing.
" 'I want you as strong as you
can get' - we don't believe in sup-
plements, we don't believe in any
of that kind of thing - 'So work
out the way (Director of Strength
and Conditioning) Aaron (Well-
man) wants you to work out and
you'll be where we want youto be,'
" Mattison tells them.
The same advice could apply
for Gordon's counterpart, fellow

linebacker Mike Jones, who lined
up at weakside linebacker spot
during Tuesday's practice with
the first teamers. He, too, is a bit
undersized for the position, listed
at 6-foot-2, 207pounds. He's a guy
that Mattisonnotedhad alsomade
big strides since the start ofspring
practice.Joneswassparinglyused
as a special teams player his fresh-
man year in 2009, and he redshirt-
ed last year after he broke his leg
against Notre Dame. The unit as a
whole still has its work cut out for
itself, though.
"There's not a lot of minutes
that have been played by those
guys in that scheme," Mattison
said of their inexperience. "You
know, where they have to react,
they have to adjust, they have to
do some things instead of just blitz
a lot -- I think that's what a lot of
them had done. So now, we have to
train them to read run-pass, take .
the perfect steps. And when it is
pass, drop back.
"All of the backers have
improved, they just have to
improve faster than everybody
else. Again, the linebacker posi-
tion in our defense might be the
most difficult - because you have
to do all of it. So that's where a lot
of the improvement will have to
happen."

Mental lapses doom Blue

SOFTBALL
Lane's game-winning homer
completes comeback for 'M'

By NEAL ROTHSCHILD
Daily Sports Writer
YPSILANTI, Mich. - Some-
times this season, it's been the
bats for the Michigan baseball
team. Other times, it's been the
pitching. MICHIGAN 2
Defense has EASTERN 8
been the
culprit on other occasions. This
time, brains were the problem.
Frequent mental lapses and a
lack of focus hurt the Wolverines
(6-16 overall) Wednesday night,
resulting in a loss to Eastern
Michigan, 8-2.
First, there was junior third
baseman John Lorenz not run-
ning after a single that bounced
off his glove, letting a man on
second come around to score.
Then, there was redshirt junior
Garrett Stephens whiffing on a
throw from junior catcher Coley
Crank when Crank had a chance
to pick off an Eagle baserunner
who had strayed too far off first
after a pitch in the dirt. Then,
there were the wild pitches, the
eight walks and the inability to
work out of hitting slumps.
"When you're in a slump, it's
mental," Michigan coach Rich
Maloney said. "They're truly not
that bad of hitters. It's in their
psyche. It's too bad that it's got-
ten to that point with so many
guys."
The game started off promis-
ing enough for the Wolverines. In
the second inning, Michigan took
advantage of an error by Eagles
starter Brian Valente on a sacri-
fice bunt to set up sophomore Pat
Biondi's two-run, two-out single.
And through three innings, red-
shirt freshman starter Logan
McAnallen was cruising.
The latter two-thirds of the
game weren't as promising. In
the fourth inning, Eastern Mich-
igan (16-9) rallied for three runs
highlighted by right fielder Ken

almost cleared the wall for a
three-run homer.
Down only one run, Michigan
had an opportunity to bounce
right back when Biondi led off
the fifth. He cracked the 1-2
pitch to deep right, but Battiston
caught it against the wall almost
at the flag pole.
"To be honest, I thought it was
gone," Biondi said. "The wind's
blowing in today. Maybe that
held it in, but we were all sur-
prised it didn't get out."
After that, it was all Eagles.
They tacked on another run in
the fifth inning and got two more
in the sixth, which saw the Wol-
verines allow three hits, two
runs, a wild pitch and the error by
Stephens to open the flood gates.
After getting two more in the
eighth, with the help of Lorenz's
mental lapse, Eastern Michigan
was on its way to an easy win.
"We didn't play very well and
it's very disappointing," Maloney
said. "It was very disheartening.
Guys just got to make plays."

game allowed the Wolverines to
throw five different arms, but
none of them impressed Maloney.
Only one - fifth-year senior Matt
Gerbe - finished the day without
surrendering a run.
Maloney knows the key to
turning things around will be
getting things straight psycho-
logically.
"It's definitely a mental thing,"
he said. "How you get out of that,
is through hard work and passion
and energy. It's the only way I
know how to get out of it. You've
got to stay positive. You have to
do the best job you can and stay
the course. That's all you can do."
With the conference season
starting on Friday against Indi-
ana, Michigan will need to for-
get about this game as soon as
possible to make sure it has the
confidence it needs to face the
Hoosiers.
"We're 0-0 going into the Indi-
ana series and if people aren't
upbeat, it's a problem," Biondi
said. "We-have a chance to start

Down 2-1 through four and
a half innings to lowly Bowling
Green, the No. 3 Michigan soft-
ball team looked ripe for an upset.
But BOWLING GREEN 2
a tow- MICHIGAN 4
ering
two-run homerun by sophomore
second baseman Ashley Lane
in the bottom of the fifth gave
Michigan a 3-2 lead, and the Wol-
verines never looked back.
Michigan (2-0 Big Ten, 32-2
overall) added another run to
take the game 4-2, with sopho-
more hurler Stephanie Speier-
man (15-0) earning the win.
Speierman went six strong,
giving up two runs (one earned)
on just three hits, despite walk-
ing six batters. Senior pitcher
Jordan Taylor closed out the
game for her sixth save of the
season.
But even though Michigan
pulled it out in the end, the team
looked lackadaisical at the start.
"I actually wasn't impressed
with our team today," coach
Carol Hutchins said. "I thought
our energy was not where I
would like it to be for a home
game. Sometimes that can be
a combination of nerves from
being at home - sometimes play-
ing at home is hard - the distrac-
tion of it all, the excitement of it
all.
"I told them after the game I
didn't think they had their best
energy, but we got away with it.
And I'm pleased to see us come
back, so in that respect, I'm glad
to see it be a good game."
Bowling Green took advantage
of Michigan's lack of energy in
the top of the third, when short-

shot into the right-field bleachers
to give the Falcons a 1-0 lead.
Then in the bottom of the
frame, Bowling Green (4-13
overall) elected to intentionally
walk senior first baseman Dorian
Shaw (.422 batting average, 11
homeruns), bringing junior third
baseman Amanda Chidester to
the plate.
"That's been happening
all year, and there have been
times where I haven't been able
to come through with -a hit,"
Chidester said. "ButI get excited
for it because I want to be able to
help the team out, so I like that
opportunity."
Chidester made Falcons pitch-
er Zada Lines pay for walking
Shaw, smacking an RBI single to
right field with two runners in
scoring position. But freshman
leftfielder Nicole Sappingfield
was gunned out at home, allow-
ing Lines to escape with the
score knotted at one.
And in the top of the fourth,
Bowling Green recaptured the
lead with some small ball.
The Falcons started off the
inning with a bloop single to
shallow left field and followed
it up with a sacrifice bunt - a
strategy they used all game long.
Chidester couldn't field the bunt,
allowing the batter to reach first,
putting runners on first and sec-
ond with nobody out.
A double steal put two Bowl-
ing Green runners in scoring
position, and a walk by Spei-
erman loaded the bases soon
after. Another base on balls then
allowed a runner to score to put
the Wolverines down 2-1.
Speierman struggled with
her command all game long, but
she continually got herself out
of jams, leaving eight Falcons on

"(Speierman) makes good
pitches," Hutchins said. "But
her game management is not
acceptable ... because balls in the
dirt, walked batters, it's just not
acceptable. You can't have six or
seven walks and pitch here.
"Her ball count is way too
high and I think she's better than
that."
In the bottom of the fifth, Lane
hit her game-winning homer, a
mammoth blast over the left field
wall. The ball hit near the top
of the trees residing outside of
the field, the only thing keeping
it from potentially reaching the
adjacent Ray Fisher Stadium.
"It felt good," Lane said. "(It
was my) first (homerun) at home,
so that was exciting, but they're
all the same. Every hit, too. She
just laid it in there and I took
advantage."
Two more singles by freshman
catcher Caitlin Blanchard and
senior designated hitter Marley
Powers ensued. Then another
base hit, this time by freshman
rightfielder Lyndsay Doyle, put
Michigan up 4-2.
Speierman kept the Falcons
from crossing the plate one more
time in the sixth, and then Tay-
lor came in with a two-strikeout,
one-two-three inning for the
save.
Despite the early hole, the
Wolverines never had any doubts
in earning their third-straight
come-from-behind victory.
"We've had better games,
obviously," Lane said. "But we
never got down, we knew we'd
come through.
"Every time we got in the cir-
cle for defense, we'd be like no
problem (Speierman), we've got

just believed that we can do it,

Delving into Dennison
By Lucy Perkins // Daily Arts Writer
In name alone, the University is packed with pres-
tige, and in realitythe campus doesn't disappoint. The
Diag, the Law Quad, Hill Auditorium and Angell Hall
do an inspiring job to ceaselessly impress prospective
students and visiting parents. But some structures
don't frequently leave the same impression - build-
ings like the David M. Dennison Building.
Seven of 11 students randomly interviewed by The
Michigan Daily said that Dennison was their least
favorite building on campus. In the opinion of LSA
freshman Adam Oxman,- there are several things
working against it.
"It's old," he said. "(It) doesn't look like much
thought went into the architecture, classes are small,
it smells bad, very hot."
According to a Michigan Daily article published on
Sept. 29, even Provost Philip Hanlon believes Denni-
son is in need of renovations, citing a need to change
the poor acoustics and flat-floored classroom struc-
ture.
Former University Provost Teresa Sullivan, now
president of the University of Virginia, was also
reported calling the building's classrooms "crummy"
and in need of a technological upgrade.
Architecturally, the building doesn't have much to
say either, according to Robert Fishman, a professor
See DENNISON, Page 4B

All about Angell
By Lauren Caserta// Daily Arts Writer
You place one foot on the first white step, feel-
ing the reassuring solidity of the massive stone slabs
beneath your sandal. You carefully avoid the watchful
eyes of the ancient figures sculpted into the building's
expansive face. As you slowly ascend, you can't help
but humbly admire the line of majestic Doric columns,
stretched like enormous tree trunks from the polished
floor of the portico up to the building's intricately
carved cornice. Are you a Roman senator preparing
to give a weighty speech? A citizen of ancient-Greece
coming to pay tribute to an angry god?
Actually, you're just late for your English lecture.
Angell Hall is just one of the four buildings collec-
tively referred to as the Angell Hall complex. A series
of interconnected halls, the complex houses every-
thing from the Departmentcof History to an astronom-
ical observatory. Angell Hall makes up the complete
western face of the building, while Mason Hall sits
at the northeast corner and Haven Hall makes up the
southeast. Tisch Hall, the smallest of the four func-
tions asa connector between Haven and Angell at the
south end of the building.
"It works as a complex - each building provides its
own individual functions, but as with any complex,
it ultimately works as a whole system," University
Planner Sue Gott said. "The different halls provide
See ANGELL, Page 4B

In the final segment of a two-part series on the University's architecture, The B-Side
answers a few questions: Why is Dennison unappealing to so much of the student body?
How did the Angell Hall complex get to be the four-building labyrinth it is? Why does the
Duderstadt Center have two "up" escalators? This issue looks behind the facade of campus.

FOOD WARS
Each week, one Ann Arbor staple menu item becomes a battlefield
as Daily Arts staffers butt heads over which restaurant makes it best.

Dear Pixar,

Here's to 25 more years of making us money.
Sincerely, Disney

Gyros

a

Dear Daniel Radcliffe,

AHMO'S
341 East Huron St.
Ahmo's surely doesn't look like first-
class dining, but that shouldn't be taken
as any comment about its food. The
Ahmo's gyro isn't anything fancy - it's
just your basic pita loaded with lamb,
tomato, onion, and tzatziki. The gyro
itself is pretty simple stuff, but the meat is
packed with flavor, and when everything
comes together it's the epitome of Greek
comfort food.
SQUARES
241 East Liberty
Since opening, Squares has deployed
a relentless marketing campaign on the
streets of Ann Arbor. If you haven't been
a victim of one of their flyer distributions,
you've probably been living under a rock.
Surprisingly, it's worth the trip down Lib-
erty for a gyro that (literally) cleans up
pretty well. The non-greasy meat, modestly
applied sauce and respectable flatbread
make for an enjoyable and tidy meal.

PARTHENON
226 South Main St.
Parthenon is one of the lesser-lauded
Main Street venues, but once diners step
inside, they're greeted by a friendly interior
and cute (if pastiche) decor. The Parthenon
gyro, however, doesn't deliver. The meat is
well spiced and the right amount of chewy,
but the onions and tomato could use some
more quality cooking time and the sauce
lacks flavor. Potential patrons should spend
their Main Street dollars elsewhere.
MR. GREEK'S
215 South State St.
Mr. Greek's is just plain yummy, and its
gyro lives up to its name. The pita is fresh,
the veggies are even fresher and, though a
teensy bit dry, the chicken is seasoned to
perfection. The best part, though, is this
gyro's tzatziki sauce. To be honest, this
chilled yogurt-cucumber concoction of
yumminess could stand alone. That's just
how delicious it is. So slop some on and
enjoy!

Please tell us your Broadway debut will be in the nude, too!

The unity of style

They wore patterned
sweatshirts or blocks
of bright color. Boys
grew their hair out to the level
of unkempt crew cut. Girls
straightened
where nec-
essary and
dabbed their
eyes with
enough mas-
cara to beau-
tify a small
village. Both SHARON
genders were JACOBS
prone to long,
eye-blocking
side bangs and multiple pierc-
ings. They called themselves
Pokemones, and in the town
where I was volunteering - a
tourist hub in the region of Pata-
gonia, in southern Chile - they
donned the label with pride.
My fellow volunteers and I
were rather confused by the
craze for Pokemdn, an exuber-
ant blend of emo and Japanese
kawaii, or "cute" styles. But it
was clearly a widespread phe-
nomenon in that part of Chile.
Seven of us were teaching Eng-
lish in various schools around
town, and we'd all had excited
students in Converse and neon
jeans announce to us, "Soy Poke-
mdn" - "I'm a Pokemon."
Was it a joke, or some hor-
rible mistranslation? We'd each
been the subject of at least one
language blunder - my friend
Kendal, asking the members of
her host family if they'd seen the
movie "Catch Me If You Can,"
chose to apply the word "coger."
In the Castillian variety of Span-
ish she'd studied, "coger" can
translate to "catch," but Latin
American Spanish has its own,
slang definition of the word,
and Kendal, through no fault of
her own, forlornly suffered the
humiliation of realizing she'd
named a film "Fuck Me If You
Can." I repeatedly used the word

Californiano to refer to myself,
as in "I'm Californiana" or "This
is how we Californianos do it." It
was only during the last week of
my stay that a giggling student
finally told me that in Chile,
Californiano means "horny."
But Pokemon was no such
linguistic mistake. It was a
legitimate fashion trend - nay,
way of life - for the teenagers
we taught. Once, on a weekend
trip to Argentina with the other
volunteers, I took a picture of
myself wearing a blue sweatshirt
ornamented with silk-screened
metallic stars. I pushed my hair
in front of my face and widened
my eyes. When I managed to get
the photo up on Facebook a few
weeks later, numerous students
let me know how hilarious I
looked - an American Pokemdn.
But my friends and I laughed
just as hard at their instant rec-
ognizing of the picture as mock
Pokemdn. The fact that we could
so successfully make fun of it
meant that, as funny as it was,
Pokemon was real.
A few months after returning
from Chile, I began my fresh-
man year at the University of
Michigan, where the boys wore
douchey shades and Rainbow-
brand flip-flops and the girls
sported Uggs and straightened
their hair to death. My first style
conclusion was that the good
people of the University were
complete fashion slobs. I had
arrived decked out in souvenirs
of my year abroad - a stiff dou-
ble-breasted jacket with a Bel-
gian label, crinkled grey jeans
from an upper-crust boutique
in Patagonia and a periwinkle
beret from France. Pretentious?
You betcha. But my wardrobe
was howI saw myself at that
time. Fast forward a semester
or so, and I had bought my first
poofy, knee-length North Face
and learned that leggings were
the best kind of pants. Without

any conscious effort, I'd adopted
a style that was never my own.
We're taught to see style as
a pure mode of physical self-
expression, the outside showing
what the inside knows and all
that crap. But my first year of
college taught me it's not always
so. For me, style was more of a
process of cultural evolution, of
changing and adapting to new
surroundings - in my case, the
urban San Francisco Bay Area
fashion trends gradually giving
way to those of a small-town
Michigan college student.
In a world full
of trends, you
gotta catch
'em all.
Style as a symbol of the col-
lective rather than the indi-
vidual identity, style as a marker
of belonging - all concepts on
which I could wax eloquent if I
were an anthropologist or psy-
chologist. But I'm not. So what
really gets me about this new
definition of style is just one
thought: If I had grown up in
Chile, would I have caught on?
For all that we make fun of silly
trends in other countries, there's
an idea that stops me in my asso-
holic culture-teasing tracks. If
trends are product of the people
rather than any one person, it
seems logical that - and the
thought stops my laughter in its
tracks - if I were a teenager in
Chilean Patagonia, chances are I
myself would be a neon, pierced,
made-up Pokemon.
Jacobs wants ponchos to be
the newest 'U' trend. To dissuade
her, e-mail shacobs@umich.edu.

0 EA 'BRING IT ON' (2000), UNIVERSAL
Bringing it on and on

ByJENNIFER XU
Senior Arts Editor
According to the personal
canon I made during my quasi-
productive, mostly dreary week
of "spring" break, "Bring It On"
ranks as the 36th greatest film I
have ever seen, wedged squarely
between the more acceptable
heavyweights "Unforgiven" (a
melancholy Western master-'
piece) and "Gilda" (Rita Hay-
worth, mee-yow!). And yes, I
am referring to the cheerleading
movie.
"Bring It On" has become a
regular fixture on cable televi-
sion, often blared noisily on the
likes of TBS or ABC Family on a
lazy Saturday night. So it's not,
strictly speaking, a "neglected
jewel" of yesteryear. Yet, while
so much has already been said
about the film - Ian Roberts's
marvelous, manic spirit fingers,
Eliza Dushku's smokin' ass, bub-
bly Kirsten Dunst back when she
was still relevant - so little about
it is given credit.
The modern teen comedy,
which debatably originated in
early John Hughes filmography,
is its own beast. There are the
tropes we've come to expect -
the inappropriately timed gay
jokes, the obligatory pan across
a notebook-sketched map of caf-
eteria cliques, the cheating loser
boyfriend - and the movies that
adhere faithfully to them. Unre-
markable on their own, these
films have managed to craft their
own discourse over the years.
But then there's the trifecta, the
films called favorites by even
those for whom pubescence is a
faraway memory. These movies
bring something special to the
table, whether brutally display-

ing the teenage condition ("The
Breakfast Club"), cheekily evok-
ing Victorian literature ("Clue-
less") or satirizing teen cliques
and queen bees ("Mean Girls").
What separates "Bring It On"
from the likes of these classics
is that it's actually really stupid.
It's about a group of cheerlead-
ers that rips off a neighboring
school's routine and then get
second place at a national compe-
tition. It's about a goofy, hyper-
kinetic girl who breaks up with
her lame boyfriend and instantly
lands herself a cute one who
plays air guitar in his bedroom.
In short: stupid.
But it works, maybe because its
expectations fall nothing short
of conveying the honest, true-
to-life adolescent experience.
In place of self-aware satire,
"Bring It On" goes for the belly
laughs - football players fum-
bling over the pigskin, a montage
of "American Idol"-style cheer
tryouts. Teenagers aren't por-
trayed as modern prophets or
Holden Caulfield-esque saviors
- they're genuinely confused,
sometimes cruel, human beings.
This authenticity intertwines
rather potently with the film's
depiction of young love: The
tooth-brushing scene (you know
which one I mean) is one of the
sweetest I've seen in contempo-
rary cinema, admittedly in part
due to the crooked smile of one
Jesse Bradford. And, it boasts a
career-best performance from
Kirsten Dunst, emotions shown
blankly on her face as she dances
like a maniac to a mixtape that
serenades her "pom poms" and
vows to feed her "bon bons."
And yet, there are the stylis-
tic things that infuse "Bring It
On" with its own all-American

aesthetic. Decked out in full
'90s fashion with belly shirts
and crimped hair, the charac-
ters develop their own brand of
teen jargon: "She puts the 'itch'
in 'bitch' " and "Follow me or
perish, sweater monkeys" most
notably spring to mind. There's
camerawork comparable to the
heavyweight caliber of Roger
Deakins (of Coen Brothers fame),
in a blink-and-you'll-miss-it kind
of way. Check the whooshing
camera tracking from foot to face
when introducing, center screen,
the head cheerleader of the rival
school, Jesus light glimmering in
the background.
A surprisingly
quintessential
teen movie.
"Bring It On" gets better and
better with every viewing, and
there's not many movies you
can say that about. I think it's
because there's something dis-
creetly original about it. While
you can lump the film into a host
of categories - whether a mod-
ern screwball made up of bobble-
headed ditzes or a postmodern
parable on ownership and origi-
nality - "Bring It On" is most
accurately a film of its own cali-
ber, completely comfortable in its
own unremarkable skin.
Toward the end of the film,
Torrance says to another char-
acter: "I am only cheerleading."
That is, both sheepishly and
exquisitely, an encapsulation of
the entire existence of "Bring It
On" - for better or worse.

War and coffee brew in
Denis's'White Material'

Film succeeds
despite lack of

By MACKENZIE METER
DailyArts Writer
Coffee - it's delicious, it's

some of us, it's an insatiable crav-
ing. Sometimes
we don't think ** ,-
about what
coffee must White
go through M erial
before we
can take that At the Michigan
first exquisite
sip, but we do IFC
know that a
lot of work goes into it. A film
offering a different perspective
on the production of coffee is
"White Material."
That's actually not quite true.
The film is about a struggling
coffee plantation called Vial
Cafe and its owner, a French-
woman named Marie (Isabelle
Huppert, "I Heart Huckabees"),
who is caught in the midst of
her adoptive African nation's
civil war. All she wants to do is
harvest a last precious crop of
beans, but her workers have run

out on her. They fear for their
lives, as they should - the fight-
ing is brutal and is escalating all
around them. On one side are the
rebels, led by an idealized fighter
named "The Boxer," who is slow-
ly dying throughout the film. On
the other side lies the oppres-
sive former regime, grappling
for power with the rebels. What
results is a chaotic, screaming
film fraught with bloodshed,
child soldiers and idealism in the
face of oppression - not exactly
a fun look at our favorite morn-
ing beverage.
It's difficult to find a true mes-
sage to take away from this film.
The message could lie in Marie's
steadfast desire to remain on the
plantation, regardless of the fact
that the French military is leav-
ing before advising her to do the
same - maybe we are supposed
to feel empowered by her iron
grip on what she holds dear. But
then again, nothing good comes
out of her remaining on the plan-
tation, since her family is scat-
tered and torn apart by the rebel
army. Maybe the message is that
people will not be silenced and
will do anything to throw off the
cloak of an oppressive regime or
an unfair government. But that
doesn't really resonate through-
out the film either - in the end,

it's the regime that maintains
the power. So what's the point?
Maybe it's OK for a film like
this not to have a "point." From
the get-go, audiences will feel
an all-encompassing absorption
by the script, becoming emo-
tionally tied to Marie's fruitless
attempts to keep the plantation.
Filmgoers will pity her son, who
is slowly losing his grip on sanity
in the face of the civil war. They
will detest the actions of the
rebel army, yet pity their fail-
ing cause. They will ultimately
abhor the oppressive regime
that triumphs. The camerawork
is gritty and gorgeous, the ten-
sion is palpable and the charac-
ters are so convincing that it's
like audiences are looking in on
a documentary.
It's one of those films that
keep hearts and minds racing
throughout. It's one of those
films that, when the lights come
on at the end, a collective exhale
by the audience can be heard
amidst expressions of "That's
the ending? I can't believe it."
One that can be appreciated for
being great without pandering
to a traditional cut-and-dry sto-
ryline. If audiences seek a film
that will stay with them for once,
they need look no further than
"White Material."

DUDERSTADT
From Page 1B
director for the design and construction
of the Center (then known as the Media
Union), said the team was inspired by its
vision of what the future would be.
"The physical location of collections
would be less important," Frank said,
referring to libraries of the future. "A
place that wasn't simply about storing
printed materials but about ... having a
place where people could learn how to
create digital materials."
That foresight was quite remarkable -
the Internet was in its nascent stages and
the thought of digitizing books seemed
like something ripped from a Philip K.
Dick story - and it led to the decision to
place the majority of the physical collec-
tion in compact shelving in the basement.
Astrollthroughthe DuderstadtCenter
today shows the fruits of this decision -
originally a controversial one, according
to Frank. Instead of dominating the facil-
ity with stacks and stacks of books, the
second and third floors of the Dude are
populated by group study rooms, clus-
ters of workstations and study tables - a
reflection of Duderstadt's belief that stu-
dents learn best by interacting with each
other. It also freed up space to add a Digi-
tal Media Commons, which now includes
a media conversion facility, recording

studios and a 3-D lab - all accessible to
any University student.
The program design for the Dude was
all about giving students access to the
tools of the future and maximizing their
creativity. The architecture, on the other
hand, was all about attractingstudents to
the building and making sure they had a
comfortable work environment.
For the building's design, the Univer-
sity hired the late famed architect Albert
Kahn's namesake firm, whose architects
were sent around the world for an idea-
generation tour.
"(The architects) came back with some
interesting designs," Duderstadt said.
"One of them was for the Pompidou Cen-
ter in Paris, which has all the pipes on the
outside."
"We said 'No, we don't think that'll
work,' "he chuckled.
The architects eventually came up
with the design seen today - a grand
atrium with glass walls letting the sun-
light beam in, towering brick pillars both
inside and outside, sleek glass elevators
and a perfectly symmetrical system of
escalators.
"I referred to this as kind of a post-
modernist version of the Temple of Kar-
nak ... almost a 3,000 year old design,"
Duderstadt joked.
The robust design was part of the
plan to make the building "spectacular,"
according to Frank.

"People living on North Campus had
always viewed themselves as living in
Siberia," Frank said. "So one of the goals
was to make this building a 'destination
building,' not just for North Campus, but
for people from Central Campus to come
up here, even if they didn't have a class
here."
The Dude's blueprint was drawn
with students' needs in mind. There are
countless quiet touches that might go
unnoticed - the paint, the surfaces, the
architectural lines, the art in the eleva-
tor shafts - all planned to make students'
time in the building more pleasant.
Even one of the most common com-
plaints about the building - the dueling
escalators that only go up from the first
to second floors - is a necessary evil. As
Frank explained, the two "up" escalators
force anyone leaving to come behind the
circulation desk and pass through the
security scanners, allowing the Dude to
stay open around the clock and only have
a few employees on staff
As the only academic building con-
stantly open during the school year, it's
an ideal fit for the study habits of most
University students.
"Probably the best thing about (the
Dude) is that it's open 24 hours, soI have a
place to work or access CAEN (Computer
Aided Engineering Network) any time of
the day, which is incredibly convenient,"
said Engineering senior Gregory Galy-
anov, who spends about 20 to 30 hours a
week in the building.
"It's awfullytall," Galyanov said of the
Dude's massive atrium. "Which gives a
nice sense of openness."
ThDude has also allowed students to
drive its evolution since it first opened in
1995.
"The students essentially view this
as their own building," Duderstadt said.
"And it is their building, so we are very
attentive to what the students want."
The building opened a coffee shop for
students early on, at a time when it was
discouraged to eat in libraries. Addition-
ally, students are continually surveyed to
see changing preferences in technology,
be it Windows, Macs or Linux machines
- changes that are often then adopted.
The Dude's model has proven to be so
successful, it has been imitatedby several
universities around the country, includ-
ing Yale, the University of Southern Cali-
fornia and the University of Texas, which
sent an entire delegation, including its
president, to survey the Center.
In true tradition to the student body's
influence on the building, the Duderstadt
Center's omnipresent nickname was
coined the minute it was renamed for the
former president.
"When they dedicated (the build-
ing), students hung signs all over in the
middle of the night, hanging on balloons
that said'The Dude Abides,"' Duderstadt
recalled. "I didn't know what that was at
the time and someone said, I had to see
'The Big Lebowski' to understand what
they're saying."
Because of the founders' extraordi-
nary foresight, The Dude certainly does
abide - and will continue to do so for
decades to come.

you'd get that feeling if you walked into
other places like, say, Dennison."
Despite its beauty, Angell Hall was not
large enough to accommodate the rap-
idly growing University enrollment for
long. The destruction by fire of the first
Haven Hall (which was originally a sepa-
rate Law building to the north) spurred
on plans for multiple additions to the
back of Angell Hall. University Hall was

finally demolished, and construction for
Mason and Haven Halls was completed
in 1952.
Mason Hall was built to house class-
rooms, while Haven was utilized as a
center for administrative offices. The
designs of these new halls diverged
noticeably from their predecessor's Par-
thenon-like elegance, since the neo-clas-
sicism that had been favored in the '20s
had been phased out and replaced by the

In a random survey by The Michigan Daily, seven of 11 students polled said Dennison was their W
least favorite building on campus.

in the Taubman College of Architecture
and Urban Planning.
"Frankly, you hardly notice it in spite
of its size," Fishman said.
According to Fishman, there are two
theories that speak to architecture on
college campuses. One of these theories
suggests that each building should have
the ability to bask alone in its architec-
tural beauty and integrity. Angell Hall
and the Law Quad fall into this category.
The other proposes that buildings on a
university campus simply function by
fitting in.
"Dennison, in my view, is simply one of
those buildings that just fits in," Fishman
said. "It does its job, but not in any spe-
cific way ... It just delivers a basic look."
Back in the day, the Harlan Hatcher
Graduate Library was considered to be
the focal point of central campus, sitting
squarely in the Diag's center. According
to Fishman, this building's intent wasnto
make a statement about the University
- but Dennison has always been a back-
ground building, Fishman said.
The architectural legend Albert
Kahn, who at his peak in the early 20th
century was responsible for 19 percent
of all industrial buildings in the United
States, founded the firm Albert Kahn
Associates (now simply called "Kahn")
in 1895. Soon after, Kahn's buildings
began to appear not only throughout the
country - like the building for Ford's
Model T assembly line - but also on the
University's campus.
According to Sally Bund, an archivist
at the Bentley Historical Library, one of
Kahn's great accomplishments was that
he revolutionized reinforced concrete in
tall buildings like Dennison.
"With this strong structural system,
he could create a lot of flexible space for
open windows," Bund said.
However, the 12-story tower and
accompanying two-story auditorium of
modernismofthe'50s. Mason and Haven
were given simpler designs that, despite
contrasting with Angell Hall aestheti-
cally, greatly augmented the functional-
ity of the building by creating one highly
integrated structure whose classrooms,
study areas and offices functioned as one
efficient network. Despite these obvious
stylistic differences, the building's dif-
ferent visual layouts are seen as a posi-
tive aspect of its architectural character.
"I don't think that the differences in
architectural style take away from the
building," LSA sophomore Sarah Abra-
ham said. "I like Angell, but you don't
really see inside of it from State Street -
I like that the big windows on the Mason
and Haven side let you see what's going
on inside the building. It has more of
an actual college feel to it since you can
see students there walking around and
studying on the window benches."
The complex received another addi-
tion much later, in the form of Tisch Hall.
The smallest structure in the complex,
it was built in 1996 as a connector used

Dennison was designedin1964byKahn's
associates, after Kahn's death in 1942.
"The firm that carried on (Kahn's)
work was very competent in retaining
the large scale process that adorns the
University's campus," Fishman said.
"But for whatever reason, they didn't
have the genius that Kahn himself had."
Fishman added: "Dennison basically
delivers space in an efficient way."
On the other hand, the building has a
very logical and straightforward design
that you expect from an architect but
don't always get, accordingto Fishman.
"It does the job," he said.
From a student perspective, the build-
ing has made a similar impression. 0
"I wouldn't say it's the worst building
on campus, I mean, the Natural Science
Building's auditorium has no leg room,"
said LSA sophomore Ellen Stults. "If I
ranked it and one was the worst, Denni-
son's probably a two or a three. It doesn't
really have any attractive features, just
one hall with rooms going off of it."
According to Fishman, the era in
which Dennison was designed may play
into what he believes to be a design that
isn't intentionally beautiful.
"I think that the integrity (of Denni-
son) is reflective of the '60s," Fishman
said. "The idea that a university build-
ing should be elaborately detailed was
pretty much dead at that point. Partially
because of the sheer expense of it, but
also the lack of people who weretalented
enough to carry out such brickwork. At
the time, to be modern was to use plain,
simple, basic geometry, a building was to
be well proportioned but not snazzy."
But regardless of what students or
professors may think about Dennison's
appearance, countless students have
had classes there at some in their college
careers, as several departments hold
classes in it. If doing its job is the pur-
pose, then Dennison has succeeded, as
it seems no one on campus can manage
without it. But if architectural aesthet-
ics are desired, students should look to
other buildings on campus.
to bridge an awkward gap between the
ends of Haven and Angell Hall, allow-
ing people to pass between the buildings
more easily. Additions to the Angell Hall
complex have always been done with a
goal of making the buildings function
smoothly as one large entity, in which
time and shifting tastes have created a
visual timeline of the University's archi-
tectural history.
"The designs of the buildings are very
complementary, even though they repre-
sent different architectural expressions,"
Gott said. "The history of the building's
expansion helps explain how this single
building has come to lookthe way itdoes,
and how the architecture has evolved
along with the different time frames of
the building's additions."
The unusual design of the Angell Hall
complex only complements the story of
the building's necessary development
from a solitary limestone edifice into the
sprawling network of classrooms, offices
and auditoriums that remains a social
and academic hub for the University.

The two escalators tothe second floor at the Duderstadt allow it to be open at all hours.

invaluable interconnectivity and com-
plementary programmatic spaces, so the
classrooms, auditoriums and office spac-
es all work holistically."
Angell Hall was the first of the four
buildings to be constructed, and its
imposing effect on observers is as pow-
erful now as it was during the early
years of its completion. Finished in 1924,
the four-story limestone building was a
response to a dire need for more space at
a time when University enrollment was
rapidly swelling. Coping with this influx
of students required a new building
that would eventually replace Univer-
sity Hall, which stood where present-
day Mason and Haven Halls exist and
was considered a central point around
which the University functioned. Angell
Hall was designed to be the answer to
the growing student population, and was
erected directly in front of University

Hall in anticipation that the latter would
be demolished soon after.
The striking neo-classical design of
Angell makes it the most iconic of the
four halls. Its architect Albert Kahn
was inspired by the aesthetics of nearby
Alumni Memorial Hall (now the Uni-
versity of Michigan Museum of Art) and
the Lincoln Memorial, which had been
designed by one of his close friends,
Henry Bacon. The building needed to
be spacious enough to act as an efficient
multi-purpose facility, holding class-
rooms and, at the time, the offices of the
University president and the dean and
the College of Literature, Science and
the Arts.
Kahn's efforts were overwhelmingly
successful, and the University was grant-
ed not only more room for expansion but
also a building that to this day acts as a
stunning visual gateway into the rest of
the University. His mastery of architec-
tural grandeur is evident in the attention
that the hall receives even today.
