Protestors demonstrate outside of the Supreme during the Fisher v. University of Texas on October 10, 2012. The Court will take up affirmative action again, this time Specific to Michigan, with oral arguments begin Tuesday.

'Court to discuss Prop. 2

SCOTUS will hear
arguments on
state's right to ban
affirmative action
By TAYLOR WIZNER
Daily News Editor
Michigan residents voted to
ban affirmative action in 2006
ballot initiative, but a case
before the U.S. Supreme Court
may reverse that decision and
set a new precedent for the way
Michigan's higher-education
institutions consider race in
application processes.
On Tuesday, the justices

will hear oral arguments on
Schuette v. Coalition to Defend
Affirmative Action, a case that
will approach the question
of whether or not the state of
Michigan violated the U.S.
Constitution and federal statu-
tory law by changing the state's
constitution to prohibit all sex-
and race-based discrimination
or preferential treatment.
The case is part of a series
of responses that occurred
after the Supreme Court's
2003 decision on affirmative
action involving admissions to
the University's Law School
in Grutter v. Bollinger, which
bears the name of former Uni-
versity President Lee Bollinger,
now president of Columbia

University. In a5-4 decision,
the court held that the Law
School's more holistic admis-
sions program, which includ-
ed race as a possible factor in
admissions decisions, was con-
stitutional. However, in Gratz
v. Bollinger, the court held that
the University's undergraduate
admissions program's assign-
ing substantial points to cer-
'tain students based on race
was unconstitutional since the
undergraduate admissions pro-
cess was more formulaic.
After the ruling, the Univer-
sity and many other institu-
tions adopted programs that
were closer to the Law School's
holistic approach and did not
assign point values based on the

different qualitiesthe applicant
possessed, particularly those
related to race.
However, the two Supreme
Court rulings based on Univer-
sity admissions policies did not
quell controversy surrounding
affirmative action, and in 2006,
58 percent of Michigan voters
approved Proposal 2. The refer-
endum amended the Michigan
constitution to prohibit racially
based preferences in admis-
sions for public universities.
University President Mary
Sue Coleman has continued to
be a vocal proponent of the use
of affirmative action in higher-
education policies, and the day

ANN ARBOR
Biz incubator
expands to aid
older startups,


Stage two of
program helps
growing ventures
By WILL GREENBERG
DailyStaffReporter
Local business incubator
Ann Arbor SPARK has expand-
ed to help Ann Arbor technol-
ogy startups grow and increase
profitability.
SPARK has added a second
stage to its incubation program,
allowing startups a chance to
advance from stage one after
growing to four or five employ-
ees. The second stage allows
companies to maintain support
from the incubator until they
reach 12 employees.
Bill Mayer, director of busi-
ness acceleration at SPARK,
said creating the bridge
between the early beta stages
of a new product and profitabil-
ity from that product is very
helpful for young companies -
especially in Ann Arbor where
space can be hard to find and is
particularly expensive.
"It doesn't make sense for a
company for 12 months, espe-

cially a task for startups, to pay
for twice thetspace they need
hoping that they'll grow into
it," he said. "Now we've grown
the capacity of companies
that we can house along their
growth curve."
SPARK's new space on the
third floor of its East, Liberty
Street building adds 2,500
square feet. He added that
having stage two helps solve a
space problem, with the stage
one space becoming overfilled
with rapidly growing compa-
nies. Stage two currently has
three residents, he said.
Len Gauger, creator of Mes-
sage Blocks, an event-planning
service, is one of the stage-two
residents. He said SPARK's
expansion, has allowed him
and his company to stay in Ann
Arbor.
"Being involved in the stage
two allowed us to continue
growing our company with-
out really chilling our bank
account," Gauger said.
While Gauger said an entre-
preneur with a prdfitable idea
is likely to be successful on his
or her own, he said the SPARK
program provided many cru-

List compiled in

By JEN CALFAS
Daily StaffReporter
The University placed third in a
set of rankings that reflectsPresident
Barack Obama's criteria for afford-
ability in higher education.
The report, released by Affordable
Colleges Online, serves as a response
the Obama administrations's pro-
posed plan to make federal funding
focus on "making college a smart
long-term investment for everyone,"
accordingtothe website.
The ranking's methodology
considered the net price of tuition
and fees subtracted by scholarship
money provided per -capita, student
loan default rate, graduation rate, the
breadth and depth of student servic-
es andstarting salaries for graduates.
In August, Obama proposed the
new set of criteria for determining
federal funding for higher-education
institutions. The plan is to reward

College students across
Michigan may feel more favor-

ably toward state legislators
when they learn they're work-
ing to protect their interests in
an unforeseen arena: the bar
scene.
A bill introduced in Lansing
last week would amend the
Liquor Control Act to ensure
that a pint of beer is at least
16 ounces, after allegations
surfaced that some bars and
restaurants were distributing

less than their advertisements

legislation would allow bars
the option to stay open until 4
a.m., as opposed to the current
closing time of 2 a.m., provided
they pay $10,000 fee each year.

Libyan Prime Minister
briefly abducted by militia

Gov't struggles
to control armed
terrorist groups
TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) - The
abduction was brief but still
audacious: Gunmen from one of
Libya's many militias stormed a
hotel where the prime minister
has a residence and held him for
several hours Thursday - appar-
ently in retaliation for his govern-
ment's alleged collusion with the
U.S. in a raid last weekend that
captured an al-Qaida suspect.
The brazen seizure of Prime
Minister Ali Zidan heightened
the alarm over the power of
unruly militias that virtually
hold the weak central govern-
ment hostage. Many of the mili-
tias include Islamic militants and
have ideologies similar to al-Qai-
da's. The armed bands regularly
use violence to intimidate offi-
cials to sway policies, gunning

down security officials and kid-
nappingtheir relatives.
At the same time, the state
relies on militias to act as secu-
rity forces, since the police and
military remain in disarray after
dictator Moammar Gadhafi was
overthrown and killed in 2011.
The militias are rooted in the bri-
gades that fought in the uprising
and are often referred to as "revo-
lutionaries."
Many militias are paid by the
Defense or Interior ministries
- which are in charge of the
military and police respectively
- althoughthe ministries are still
unable to control them.
Not only was Zidan abducted
by militiamen who officially work
in a state body, it took other mili-
tias to rescue him by storming
the site where he was held in the
capital.
"The abduction is like the
shock that awakened Libyans.
Facts on the ground now are
clearer than never before: Libya

*LOH5

is ruled by militias," said promi-
nent rights campaigner Hassan
al-Amin.
Zidan's abduction came before
dawn Thursday, when about
150 gunmen in pickup trucks
stormed the luxury Corinthia
Hotel in downtown Tripoli, wit-
nesses told The Associated Press.
They swarmed into the hobby
and some charged up to Zidan's
residence on the 21st floor.
The gunmen scuffled with
Zidan's guards before they seized
him and led him out at around
5:15 a.m., said the witnesses,
speaking on condition of ano-
nymity because they feared for
their own safety. They said Zidan
offered no resistance.
In-the afternoon, government
spokesman Mohammed Kaabar
told the LANA news agency that
Zidan had been "set free."
A militia commander affiliated
with the Interior Ministry said
his fighters, along with armed
groups from two Tripoli dis-
tricts, Souq Jomaa and Tajoura, '
stormed the house where Zidan
was being held, exchanged fire
with the captors, and rescued
him.
"He is now safe in a safe place,"
said Haitham al-Tajouri, com-
mander of the Reinforcement
Force, in an interview with Al-
Ahrar TV.
Zidan later appeared at a
Cabinet session that was broad-
cast live. He thanked those
who helped free him but gave
no details and avoided blaming
those behind the abduction.
"We hope this matter will be
treated with wisdom and ratio-
nality, far from tension," he said.
"There are many things that need
dealing with."
The abduction was carried
out by two state-affiliated mili-
tia groups, the Revolutionaries
Operation Room and the Anti-
Crime Department. They put
out statements saying they had
"arrested" Zidan on accusations
of harming state security and
corruption. The public prosecu-
tor's office said it had issued no
such warrant.

..sent entiEgypt
rises as State Dep.halts aid

Cancellation is result
of former pres. Morsi
ousting in July
CAIRO (AP) - Washington's
decision to withhold millions of
dollars in mostly military aid to
Egypt is fueling anti-U.S. senti-
ment and the perception that
Washington supports Moham-
med Morsi, the Islamist presi-
dent the military ousted in a
July coup.
That could boost the popu-
larity of the military chief,
Gen. Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi,
whom the U.S. is trying to pres-
sure to ensure a transition to
democracy and ease the fierce
crackdown on Morsi's Muslim
Brotherhood.
The aid freeze could also
embolden Morsi's supporters
to intensify their campaign of
street protests in the belief that
the military-backed govern-
ment is losing the goodwill of
its top foreign backer. The pro-
tests, met by a fierce response
by security forces that has left
hundreds dead, have kept the

new government from tackling
Egypt's pressing problems after
2 a/ years of turmoil.
Still, Egypt's military-backed
government is unlikely to aban-
don the road map it announced
when Morsi was removed in
a July 3 coup - to amend the
nation's Islamist-tilted consti-
tution and put the changes to a
nationwide vote before the end
of the year, and hold parliamen-
tary and presidential ballots in
early 2014.
"Egypt is not so desperate
that it needs to compromise on
its political agenda," the U.S.-
based global intelligence firm,
Stratfor, wrote this week.
"The United States will be the
one to eventually readjust to the
old reality of backing unpopular
regimes that can preserve U.S.
influence in the Nile River Val-
ley."
Warnings that Washington
might cut off aid were met with
a defiant response in the Egyp-
tian media.
"Let American aid go to hell,"
screamed the banner headline of
Thursday's edition of Al-Tahrir,
an independent daily that is a
sworn critic of the Brotherhood

and the United States.
Egyptian newspapers and
television have for weeks taken
a deeply hostile line toward the
United States, portraying Wash-
ington as unhappy to see Morsi
and his Muslim Brotherhood
lose power and lambasting it for
allegedly meddling in Cairo's
affairs.
The U.S. announced it was
freezing hundreds of mil-
lions of dollars in aid, most of
it meant for the armed forces,
as a show of displeasure over
Morsi's ouster and the subse-
quent crackdown on his Muslim
Brotherhood and other Islamist
allies. Washington said the aid
would be restored if "credible
progress" was made toward set-
ting up an inclusive, democrati-
cally elected government.
In its announcement
Wednesday, the U.S. State
Department did not provide
a dollar amount of what was
being withheld, most of itlinked
to military aid, but officials in
Washington said it included 10
Apache helicopters at a cost of
more than $500 million, M1A1
tank kits and Harpoon anti-
ship missiles.

DETROIT
Ex-Mayor Kwame
Kilpatrick gets 28
years in jail
A former Detroit mayor was
sent to federal prison for.nearly
three decades Thursday, after
offering little remorse for the
widespread corruption under his
watch but acknowledging he let
down the troubled city during a
critical period before it landed in
bankruptcy.
Prosecutors argued that
Kwame Kilpatrick's "corrupt
administration exacerbated the
crisis" that Detroit now finds
itself in. A judge agreed with
the government's recommenda-
tion that 28 years in prison was
appropriate for rigging con-
tracts, taking bribes and putting
his own price on public business.
It is one of the toughest penal-
ties doled out for public corrup-
tion in recent U.S. history and
seals a dramatic fall for Kilpat-
rick, who was elected mayor in
2001 at age 31 and is the son of
a former senior member of Con-
gress.
WHEELING, W. Va.
Ex-police officer
warns people
before shooting
The ex-police officer who
opened fire on a federal court-
house in West Virginia was a
trained shooter who knew how
to kill, yet federal officials said
Thursday that he waved people
away moments before he started
spraying bullets into the glass
facade and was later shot dead by
law enforcement.
Neither the FBI nor federal
prosecutors would discuss the
motive for 55-year-old Thomas
J. Piccard's assault. But two pos-
sible theories emerged as inves-
tigators gathered evidence and
neighbors revealed that Piccard
had recently told them he was
dying of canter.
U.S. Attorney William Ihlen-
feld said the building being the
target and other evidence he
wouldn't specify indicates Pic-
card "had an anti-government
bias."
TEHRAN, Iran
Rebels kill Iranian
Revolutionary
Guards
An Iranian semi-official news
agency is reporting an armed
group has killed five members of
the elite Revolutionary Guards
in a Kurdish area near the Iraqi
border.
The Thursday report by Fars
quotes an unnamed official as
saying two other members of
the Guards were wounded in the
midday clash with "counterrevo-
lutionary armed guerrillas" near
the Kurdish town of Baneh, some
305 miles (488 km) west of Teh-
ran.

The report did not name any
group but the area is scene of
occasional clashes between gov-
ernment forces and rebels.
ATHENS, Greece
Google executive
t disagrees with
complaints
Eric Schmidt, Google's execu-
tive chairman, said Thursday
that he respects but disagrees
with complaints about his com-
pany's privacy policies made by
data protection authorities in six
European countries.
Schmidt said the Internet
search and ad giant has "very
broadly communicated" its poli-
cies to authorities in the coun-
tries where the complaints have
been made.
Data watchdogs in France,
Britain, Germany, Italy, Spain
and the Netherlands have said
Google needs to provide addi-
tional guarantees to comply with
national privacy protection rules
in each of those countries.
Schmidt made his comments
in Athens while attending a
technology event there, and after
meeting with Greek Prime Min-
ister Antonis Samaras.

From Page 1
2, she gave a dramatic speech on
the Diag promising to maintain
diversity at the University.
"Make no mistake: We will
find the route that continues our
commitment to a richly diverse
student body," Coleman said in
2006.
When commentingFisher v.
University of Texas last year,
Coleman rejected the argument
that affirmative action was no
longer necessary and said she
couldn't foresee a day when such
programs were no longer neces-
sary.
Immediately after the vote,
a number of pro-affirmative-
action groups filed suit against
the state and its public higher
education institutions in order to
nullify the law, claiming itviolat-
ed the U.S. Constitution. In addi-
tion, another suit was filed by a
group of University students and
professors with similar allega-
tions as the first challenge to the
law. State Attorney General Bill
Schuette, a Republican, joined
the cases as a defendant.
In 2011, Judge David Law-
son of the federal district court
for the Eastern District of
Michigan granted Schuette's
motion for summary judgment,
which had the effect of uphold-
ing Michigan's constitutional
amendment and banning affir-
mative action. The coalition and
university plaintiffs appealed to
the Sixth Circuit Court, which
struck down the amendment,
agreeing that it violated the
Constitution and federal statu-
tory law. The sixth circuit then
reviewed the case again with
the full number of judges serv-
ing on the court and agreed with

the earlier decision striking
down Michigan's constitutional
amendment.
Last year, the U.S. Supreme
Court agreed to hear arguments
on the case. The court issued a
notice Thursday that the oral
arguments would take place
Tuesday regardless of the gov-
ernment shutdown, which has
paralyzed most of Washington
D.C.
Law Prof. Richard Friedman,
an expert on U.S. Supreme Court
history, said the plaintiffs will
likely make the argument that
this amendment is a type of polit-
ical restructuring that disadvan-
tages minority citizens.
Friedman said the arguments
will likely mirror the string
of Supreme Court cases that
dealt with violations of the 14th
Amendment. Freedman cited
the 1969 Supreme Court case
Hunter v. Erickson in which the
City of Akron, Ohio could not
amend their city charter to allow
housing ordinances with racial,
religious or ancestral discrimi-
nation.
Friedman added that the
plaintiffs will argue that the
case is similar to a Seattle case
from 1982,Washington v. Seattle
School District No. 1, in which
the state attempted to amend its
constitution banning busing for
purposes of racial desegregation
but allowed children to be bused
from district to district for other
purposes. Justice Harry Black-
mun held in the majority opinion
that it was a type of restructuring
and violated the equal protection
granted in the 14th Amendment.
"That is the best case that the
plaintiffs have" said Friedman,
He indicated the similarities that
both Schutte and the Seattle case
involved a state-wide decision
impacting something that might
be done in favor of minorities.

Both states attempted to amend
their constitutions to say, "No,
we aren't going to do it," Freed-
man explained.
However, Friedman said
today's bench will probably be
less inclined to follow previous
courts' decisions. He noted that
the court's decision on the Seat-
tle case functioned as a larger
statement on discrimination,
something he said today's court
is unlikely to do.
"It is a very different atmo-
sphere today from 1969 and
1982," Friedman said. "So, you
look at busing back then. Some
courts were ordering busing in
some circumstances- it was
nevertheless a remedy that was
being used to counter segre-
gation. So when people voted
against it, it had a strong racially
tinged feeling. It was going a lit-
tle bit against the judicial tide."
Friedman said based on evi-
dence of the current .court's
history with affirmative action -
the law school case only won by
a 5-4 vote, and in the case earlier
this year, Fisher v. University of
Texas, the Court tightened up
where affirmative action was
going to be allowed - he sus-
pects the court will hold that
Michigan voters can ban affir-
mative action without violating
the federal constitution.
"It is very hard here for a state
to get past the Supreme Court
saying we want to do affirma-
tive action" Friedman said, " so
when a state says we don't want
the university to do affirmative
action, I think the court is much
more likely to be receptive to
that.,"
"Here, affirmative action itself
is hanging by a thread. When
people say no I don't want it, I
think some of the justices are
going to say of course the people
can saythat."

Engineering lecturer Moses
Lee is the founder of another
SPARK stage-two company,
Seelio, which helps students
create a portfolio of their work
before graduating. Lee and his
co-founders are all University
alumni.
Seelio currently has 11
employees and is growing
quickly, but Lee said SPARK

has helped the company expand
across the country.
"It allows us to focus in on
operating our company and get-
ting success and building the
business and not having to worry
about space - having to worry
about the internet and coffee or
things along those lines," Lee
said.
He added that SPARK is one
of the many business incubators

foster growth for the large num-
ber of startups in the area. He
said Seelio will likely move into
its own office within the nextsix
to l2 months.

bill is about consumer protec-
tion.
Knezek said the only opposi-
tion he has received is from res-
taurant owners concerned that
they may have to purchase all
new glassware to abide by the
new law, should it pass.
Several Ann Arbor-area bars,
including Good Time Charley's,
the Brown Jug Restaurant and
The Blue Leprechaun, said they
already use 16-ounce glasses for
their standard drinks and don't
anticipate the possible passage
of this bill having an impact on
their serving habits.
"Some places use 14-ounce
glasses, but, according to. the
industry standard, you're sup-
posed to have about an inch
of head on every glass, which
accounts for about an ounce,"
David Root, general manager of
the Brown Jug,
said. "If this standard was
applied to liquor, though, it
would help create a standard
because everyone pours differ-
ently, so what's one shot at one
place might be closer to two at
another."
He said the Brown Jug would
probably not adopt these policies
because management considers
their establishment a bar and res-
taurant rather than a dance club.
"We're not a club, so people
are coming in to drink but also to
eat," Root said. "Right now peo-
ple start coming in for the night
at about 11:30 (p.m.), so it would
be pretty terrible for the staff if
it didn't start until 1:30 or later."
Root also sees the extended
hours as a potential safety haz-
ard, both with patrons consum-
ing more alcohol and policing
issues.
"By 2 a.m., most people are
pretty maxed out, and, by 3
o'clock, anhour after bars close, a
lot of the police have left the area
and gone back to their normal
shifts, so it definitely might not
be as safe that way," Root said.
"I think that if something like
that was happening over here,
word would get around pretty

fast," he said. "As far as I know,
a pint is 16 ounces so that's what
we use and that's whatI've heard
most people use."
Gradillas said if the legislation
passed today, The Blue Lepre-
chaun would probably pay the
$10,000 fee, but would gauge stu-
dent reaction before implement-
ing them.
"This is such a smaller city
than, say, Chicago, where bars
are always open this late, and
being a college town, students
have classes and other commit-
ments and might not embrace
staying out until 4 a.m. regular-
ly," Gradillas said.
Ben Hammond, assistant
manager at Good Time Char-
ley's, doesn't think his bar
would implement the new policy
because of the logistical diffi-
culty.
"Michigan has always been
a 2 a.m. state, and by that time
people seem pretty worn down,"
Hammond said. "Increasing our
hours would increase the cost
of labor a lot depending on what
the clientelewants,andwe're not
in a position to benefit from it as
much as clubs and casinos in a .
place like Detroit are."
LSA senior Katie Marenghi,
who favors Ashley's and the
South University bars, said she
would definitely be in favor of the
extension of bar hours.
"Some nights I feel like clos-
ing time is a good excuse to go
home, but other nights it's 2 a.m.
and I'm like, 'Where's the after-
party?'" Marenghi said.
'LSA senior Elise Huerta said
the increased bar time wouldn't
make much of an impact on her
tab.
"I don't have time to go to bars
during the school year, so staying
out until four isn't really a possi-
bility for me," she said. "I could
see how some people might think
it's great but if you think about
going to a house party where
you can stay as long as you want,
people generally leave around 2
or 2:30 because that's just when
things naturally end."
Huerta pointed to her experi-
ences in Europe, where it's the
norm for bars to be open much
later, and that Americans begin
nights out earlier.

DEBATE
From Page 1
2003, was forced to restruc-
ture its holistic approach to the
applications process so as not to
include race.
Data from the Law School's
admissions department shows
that most minority students
have not been affected by
admissions without acknowl-
edging race. The number of
enrolled Black students, how-
ever, did decrease substantially,
from 25 in 2006 to 14 in 2013.
Sarah Zearfoss, the direc-
tor of admissions for the Law
School, said the admissions
department began to more
actively seek out a more diverse
applicant pool as the depart-
ment could not award points to
an applicant's individual diver-
sity.
"We can use our best efforts
to recruit an applicant pool
and to matriculate the people

who we've admitted, but with-
out being able to take race into
account in the decision-making
process we necessarily have to
admit fewer minorities than
we did when we could employ
affirmative action," Zearfross
said. "We aggressively recruit
and have a number of recruiting
efforts that we make to try and
do our best but ... we have fewer
African-Americans in the class
post-Prop 2."
She added that after the pas-
sage of Proposal 2, the depart-
ment decided they still wanted
to achieve a racially diverse stu-
dent body - though it would not
longer be a part of the applica-
tion review.
"There's no good substitute
for that as a factor in the deci-
sion-making," Zearfross said.
"We can't and we still want to
have a diverse student body so
we do alot to, as we say, create a
diverse applicant pool."
The law school applica-
tion process follows a self-

proclaimed holistic approach,
in which the school considers
all aspects of the applicant,
excluding race. Zearfoss said
that she never knows the race
of an applicant she is reviewing.
Zearfross said that if the
U.S. Supreme Court decides to
overturn the ban on affirmative
action pending in Schuette v.
Coalition to Defend Affirmative
Action, which it will hear next
week, the department would
have to reevaluate what its
admissions process would be.
"If they struck down Prop 2,
then we would be in the same
place as every other private
school in the nation, which
does take race into account - at
least, the elite schools do, and
they have to comply with the
Fisher decision from last term,"
Zearfross said. "We haven't
really had to think about Fisher
because Prop 2 trumps Fisher
for us. If Prop 2 were to be
struck down, we would have to
start all over from scratch."

Four former U.S. officials
meet with Edward Snowden


Former officials
say Snowden has
no regrets about
leaking information
MOSCOW (AP) - Four for-
mer U.S. government officials
who met with former National
Security Agency systems ana-
lyst Edward Snowden said
Thursday that he is adjusting
to life in Russia and express-
es no regrets about leaking
highly classified information.
Separately, Snowden's father
arrived to see his son.
The Americans, who once
worked for the CIA, FBI, Jus-
tice Department and NSA, have
criticized the U.S. govern-
ment and exposed what they
believed was wrongdoing in
the security agencies. All sup-
porters of Snowden, they are
the first Americans known to
have met with him since he
was granted asylum in Russia
in August.
In interviews with The Asso-
ciated Press, they described
spending the previous evening
with Snowden to present him
with an award given annually
by a group of retired national
security officers.
"He spoke about going out
and about and getting to under-

stand Russia and its culture
and the people," said Thomas
Drake, who started working for
the NSA in 2001 and disclosed
an electronic espionage pro-
gram that he saw as invasive.
"This is where he lives now,
and. so where you live is your
home."
Snowden's father, Lon, did
not say when or where he would
meet his 30-year-old son, but
expressed optimism about his
situation.
"You know, I have heard so
many things through the media,
and my assumption is certain-
ly, given the circumstances,
he's doing as well as could be
expected," Lon Snowden told
the AP shortly after he arrived
in Moscow. "He's safe and he's
free, and that's a good thing."
The elder Snowden said he
doubts his son will return to
the United States, where he
is charged with violating the
Espionage Act for disclosing
the NSA's surveillance of phone
and Internet usage around the
world.
The four former U.S. officials
refused to say where they met
with Snowden or where he is
living.
"For his own safety it's best
that no one else knows where
he actually lives," Drake said.
"But I believe he is making the
best of his circumstances and is

living as normally as possible."
Like Snowden, Drake was
indicted under the Espionage
Act, but the felony charges
were dropped before trial and
he was found guilty in 2011 on a
lesser charge and sentenced to
one year of probation and com-
munity service.
Drake and the other Ameri-
cans - Raymond McGovern,
Jesselyn Radack and Coleen
Rowley - said Snowden was in
good spirits and still believes
he did the right thing in dis-
closing the NSA surveillance
program.
All but McGovern are past
recipients of the Sam Adams
Award, named for a CIA ana-
lyst during the Vietnam War
who accused the U.S. mili-
tary of underestimating the
strength of the enemy for
political purposes. The award
is given annually by the Sam
Adams Associates for Integrity
in Intelligence.
The winner of the award in
2010 was WikiLeaks and its
founder, Julian Assange.
McGovern, a 74-year-old
retired CIA officer who had
worked with Adams, said the
anti-secrecy group had facili-
tated its trip to Moscow and
that WikiLeaks staffer Sarah
Harrison, who had arrived
with Snowden from.Hong Kong
in June, remained by his side.

value and opportunities for stu-
dent success after graduation.
The University placed behind
the University of Virginia and
the University of North Carolina
at Chapel Hill, which ranked first
second, respectively. The Uni-
versity's average starting salary
of $51,300 ranked above the two
schools and its average net price
of attendance is calculated as
being $14,074.
Just as at the national level,
the issue of college affordability
sits at the forefront of concerns
for University administrators,
especially during the presiden-
tial search process.
At University President Mary
Sue Coleman's annual leader-
ship breakfast Tuesday, she
reiterated the fundraising goals
of the upcoming development
campaign, Victors for Michigan.
With a $1-billion goal for student
aid, raising money to lower the
cost of attendance is the cam-
paign's main focus.
"We must provide the finan-
cial support to make a Michigan
education possible for more stu-
dents," Coleman said Tuesday.
"These are the campaign goals:

engaged learning, bold ideas and,
most importantly, the number
one-priority is student support. "
University tuition has risen
over the past decade due to
declining state appropriation.
While Coleman has completed
her tenure amid national eco-
nomic, turmoil, . tuition has
raised from $7,484 to $12,948
for in-state residents and $23,198
to $40,198 for non-residents
between 2002 and 2013
"Higher education is the
single most important invest-
ment students can make in their
futures, and U of M is the place
where they can invest, achieve
and not be set back by financial
burdens," Coleman said.
In a September. interview,
University Provost Martha Pol-
lack said affordability is a prima-
ry concern in the coming years.
Although Coleman will leave her
position in July, Pollack said she
hopesthe newpresidentwillcon-
tinue to lead efforts towards cost
containment with the help from
current administrators working
towards keeping the University
as affordable as possible.
"I think we have a good team
in place to keep on pushing, and
I'm very optimistic that the new
president will have support for
where she needs to handle these
challenges," Pollack said.

A minor compensation
Alternative solutions should be created for young athletes
n Sept. 27, it was announced that Electronic Arts and The Collegiate
Licensing Company had decided to settle in three lawsuits, agreeing
to pay out up to $40 million to college athletes whose likenesses had
been featured in NCAA football games over the past 10 years. Apart from the
profits of video-game companies, unpaid student-athletes are contributing
a product that has created a billion-dollar industry, This process, especially
exploitative of football and basketball players, is a controversy that has risen
time and time again with no clear solution. As the divide between academia
and college athletics expands at universities like Michigan, practical solu-
tions should be explored to compensate student athletes.

The settlement between EA and the CLC
will provide athletes featured in the NCAA
football video games a cut of the $40-million
settlement. Yet, because of the complexity of
the payouttovarious athletes, alongwith attor-
ney's fees, many players will receive a paltry
compensation compared to the earnings of the
industry. In 2011, the NCAA signed a $10.8-bil-
lion contract with CBS and Turner Sports for
the television rights to the NCAA men's bas-
ketball tournament, March Madness. The Big
10's current television contract exceeds $4 bil-
lion in total and comesto $20.7million peryear
per school. These immense profits, which don't
take into account merchandising and ticket
sales, come from the effort and skill of college
athletes who.receive no compensation.
The NCAA has long maintained the position
that its student-athletes are students first. On
Oct. 7, NCAA President Mark Emmert spoke
at Marquette University, saying, "One of the
guiding principles (of the NCAA) has been that
this is about students who play sports." Despite
this sentiment, the academic gap between col-
lege athletes and regular students shows that
student-athletes are not prioritizing school. At
the University, the overall graduation rate was
89.7 percent in 2010. In contrast, University
football student-athletes graduated at a signifi-
cantly lower rate of 69 percent in 2012. In 2011,
Michigan's men's basketball team had a gradu-

ation rate of 36 percent. These percentages
directly contradict the notion that student-ath-
letes are considered students first. Instead of
being rewarded with a bachelor's degree, many
student-athletes are leaving college early with
no degrees and no direct compensation while
the collegiate sport business profits immeasur-
ably. This problem is compounded by the fact
that, besides college baseball athletes, less than
2 percent of all NQAA.amateurs go pro.
One possible way to alleviate to this conun-
drum is to create a minor league for the NFL.
In the NBA, NHL and MLB minor leagues,
players can opt to immediately begin playing
for a salary if their ultimate goal is to compete
as professionals. Expanding these leagues and
creating a minor league affiliated with the
NFL would solve some of the problems associ-
ated with paying college players. For athletes
who value a college education, they can pursue
one while simultaneously playing the sport
they love and excel at playing. And ifa player
truly stands out on a college team, playing in a
national league is still a possibility.
The NCAA has shown that it's absolutely
unwilling to allow college athletes tobe mone-
tarily compensated for their abilities and their
image, so other.options need to be available.
Players should be compensated fairly, while
simultaneously allowing a viable path for those
athletes who wish to attain a college education.

MATTHEW LESLIE SANTANA I
Caricature or character?

";El pueblo unido jamis serivencido!" shout-
ed the students on the Diag Wednesday. I was
walking toward Haven Hall on my way to see
Nesha Haniff, a professor of mine with whom
I had travelled to SouthAfrica in 2008. "What
whitegroup ofstudents is co-optingfor their own
purposes that classic chant from Chile's Nueva
Cancidn tradition?" I thought to myself as I
went into Angell Hall. Sometimes Ann Arbor
can be such a caricature of itself.
When I arrived at Nesha's office, she
immediately asked me if I would join her in
heading downstairs to the Diag demonstra-
tion. She explained that a group of students
had organized this to voice their discontent
with the decrease in minority enrollment at
the University.
"I guess I was wrong about those students on
the Diag,"I thought as we headed downstairs.
On the Diag, I caught up with some friends,
chanted some chants and was glad to see
some familiar faces from the faculty and staff
of the Department of Afroamerican and Afri-
can Studies.
Suddenly, I was brought back to perhaps
exactly seven years ago, when I was a fresh-
man here on the Diag handing out literature
about and protesting Proposal 2, the ballot
initiative set forth by the so-called Michigan
Civil Rights Initiative (now there's some co-
optation for you).

The initiative sought to cripple affirmative
action in the state of Michigan - and it suc-
ceeded. On Wednesday, I was reminded that
what we had predicted in 2006 has come true:
Diversity is on the decline on the Univer-
sity of Michigan, Ann Arbor campus. What's
more, the University has a smaller percentage
of Black, Latino and Native American stu-
dents than other highly selective public and
private institutions.
Sometimes Ann Arbor can be a caricature
of itself, but that day was not one of those days.
On Wednesday, the University of Michigan's
students of color and our allies showed what
tremendous character we have in the face of
adversity. We're going to need that character as
the Supreme Court hears arguments on Oct.15
for Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative
Action, the appeal that has resulted from the
overturning of Proposal 2 in 2011.
It's unclear what the court will do, but if their
rulings this year on the Civil Rights Act of 1964
and the University of Texas admissions policy
are any indication, the forecast isn't good. Now,
more than ever, it's important that we students
of color at the University of Michigan remem-
ber that even if our numbers dwindle we still
have avoice.
Matthew Leslie Santana is a Doctoral student
in the School of Music, Theatre & Dance.

I've thought about writing a
piece like this for more than a year.
Where do I start? From the top, I
guess. I've recently come out as gay
and want to share my story for two
reasons. First, on National Coming
Out Day I hope that people going
through similar experiences will be
reminded that they are not alone.
Second, I hope that my story will
encourage others to evaluate the
current state of LGBT acceptance
efforts in the Ross School of Busi-
ness. These efforts have effects on
real people. They have effects on
me. They have effects on all of us,
gay or straight.
Like most, I denied and repressed
my feelings when I was younger,
thinking that they would go away.
Through middle and high school
I lied. I tried to create a world for
myself where I had what I thought,
I needed to be happy. I ended up
hurting others. For example, I pre-
tended to be romantically inter-
ested in a close friend and entered
a relationship. I needed the friend-
ship but was afraid to admit to her
that the feelings weren't mutual.
I remember being made fun of for
the way I talked, my (lack of) knowl-
edge about sports, and my friends. A
classmate in middle school claimed
that I had a "gay lisp" in front of my
English class. I would sometimes say
that I couldn't go to lunch because I
had to do homework and not because
I had no one to sit with. I remem-
ber looking at each year in school as
a chance to make genuine friends.
Each time I failed.
Deep down, I knew that my lack
of self-acceptance was the root of
the problem, but I put the blame on
anything and anyone but myself. I
thought that I couldn't be success-
ful or happy if.I was gay. Whenever I
heard a referenceto anything "gay," it

was by peers using the term to make
fun of something or someone.
Near the end of my freshman
year at the University, I found
myself about to return home feeling
like I had accomplished little. Sure,
I made the grades I felt I needed to
get into the Business School and
could talk on end about an intern-
ship and extracurricular activities.
But I had made few friends and
didn't feel accepted in Ann Arbor,
the most open and tolerant place I
had ever lived. I struggled to let go
of my misperceptions about what it
meant to be gay.
I realized the only way for me to
end my cycle of superficial friend-
ships and lack of a social life was
to embrace who I am and open up.
Even if I managed to fool others, I'd
never be able to fool myself.
At first, coming out to friends
and family was a scary process.
Sometimes it still is. Most react
well. Some don't. But by coming
out, I've finally made clear who I
am and have absolutely no regrets
about revealing something I know
to be true.
I've lived more than enough of
my life in the closet. Now that I've
finally become comfortable with
myself, I feel a need to try and make
a positive impact where I can.
There aren't many openly gay peo-
ple at Ross, especially among under-
graduates. Out of nearly 1,500 BBAs,
there are five in Out for Business,
the school's LGBT student associa-
tion. Perhaps more telling are results
from out for Business's weeklong
ally pledge competition - a com-
petition between BBAs and MBAs
to publicly shqw LGBT support in
honor of National Coming Out Day.
Three quarters of the way through
the competition, 244 of 1,000 MBAs
had pledged support, compared to 24

BBAs. I haven't felt that Ross'sunder-
graduate population is homophobic
- instead I think that BBAs are too
career-driven and ignore important
social causes.
Business has the power to spread
ideas and innovations across bor-
ders. But how can the business
world maximize its power as a
change agent if its people are afraid
to address sensitive issues head-
on? I want to encourage more open,
candid discussions of topics that
may seem awkward in places like
Ross. The fact that business can be
impersonal and numbers-driven is
an asset. Businesspeople shouldn't
care if they include a marginalized
group. Emotions will always play a
part in any relationship - I get that.
But gay people have proven them-
selves as smart individuals who
contribute to the bottom line. Peo-
ple in the business world can serve
as leaders by showing others that
there's no downside to being more
accepting. Gay people are every-
where and aren't going away.
In many ways I'm extremely
lucky. I haven't been beaten up for
being gay. I'm receiving a great edu-
cation at the University and have
endless choices for a future career.
I have friends. My parents struggle
to accept me as gay but certainly
haven't disowned me. I therefore
feel a responsibility to speak out
for the sake of the many members
of the LGBT community who face
challenges far more staggering than
mine. I'm at the same stage in my
life as my fellow juniors. I share the
same career goals, academic aspira-
tions and fears. The only difference
is that I have insight into what it's
like to be part of a group that still
faces legal and social discrimination.

Sondheim play to
teach love lessons

The 'Gravity' of the film
industry's situation

'A Little Night
Music' to explore
sex, marriage
By PAIGE PFLEGER
Daily Arts Writer
Stephen Sondheim's "A Little
r Night Music" is a Tony Award-
winning musical centered on
the romantic
lives of sev- A Little
eral different Night MUSC
couples, and
how their pas- Friday and
sions intersect. Saturday at 8
Taking place p.m. and Sun.
circa 1900 in day at 2p.m.
Sweden, the
show revolves Mendelssohn
around the $22
life of Fredrik
Egerman,
played by School of Music,
Theatre & Dance senior Conor
McGiffin. The show follows
Egerman's current relationship
with his wife and a permeating
love interest from the distant
past.
"The great thing about Sond-
heim is that no matter how gor-
geous the music can be on the
surface, there is always some-
thing happening within the
music that lets you know that
this isn't something that you can
just sit back and let wash over
you," McGiffin said. "There are
always little details about who
the characters are, and what is
happening that Sondheim lets
you know."
In tackling such an intricate
show, Director and Associate
Professor of Musical Theater,
Mark Madama, used his expert

knowledge of Sondheim's
work. In his past years teach-
ing at MT&D, he has worked on,
five Sondheim shows, includ-
ing "Sunday in the Park with
George" and "Into the Woods."
ladama begins with the
music and immediately gets the
actors onstage to begin block-
ing. After the bare bones of
the scenes are laid out, actors
are encouraged to explore
more deeply their character's
motives, and to discover new
relationships and ways of com-
municating on stage.
"Every show has a differ-
ent story," Madama said. "This
show is interesting because of
its very mature subject matter.
Tapping into the students and
having them understand that
mature level of relationships
has been very rewarding."
The show's thematic scheme
deals with love, sex, marriage,
infidelity and how complex sit-
uations can be when said emo-
tions are involved.
"I know the students all quite
well," Madama said of his cast,
"and the thing that is so great
is how they've embraced the
material. They haven't shied
away from it; they've jumped in
and embraced it..I'm excited to
share the show with the audi-
ence."
Despite the seriousness of the
subject matter, the cast has still
had fun creating the world of "A
Little Night Music." From dis-
covering the possible harmful
effects of the corsets that the
women must wear for the show,
to goofy face-offs between
characters; McGiffin has fond
memories of "Night Music," not
least because it is one of the last

shows of his career here at the
University.
"I've known Connor McGif-
fin since he's been here and
had him in three of my perfor-
mance classes," Madama said.
"He's embraced this character
pretty fully. He's found the
maturity of this man, the con-
textual quality of this man; he
sings the role great ... He really
transforms himself into being
a man that is older and who is
involved in a relationship that
at one time may have seemed
completely satisfying and then
changes."
Approaching opening night,
McGiffin will have the usual
pre-show jitters, but this year,
they come with a dash of nos-
talgia.
"When the curtains raise I
anticipate looking around at all
the freshmen who are working
backstage and feeling a well
of emotion," McGiffin said,
"because four years ago I was
there."
Above all else, McGif-
fin hopes that "A Little Night
Music" will leave the audience
with a few valuable lessons
about love.
"Love is'real," McGiffin said.
"The show is really about peo-
ple at points in their lives miss-
ing the person they belong with.
I want them to go away with
the love of the music that was
put forth, and to remember the
comedy of the show, and that
if you're away from someone,
you can always come back to it.
Certain loves don't fade away as
time goes on. Respect the power
of it. As the sage Huey Lewis
once said, 'That's the power of
love.' "

Full disclosure: I have
something of a reputation
among friends for being
the guy that likes to speak in
extremes. After my first-ever
screening of
"Paranormal
Activity,"
I blurted
something
vaguely
along the
lines of,
"They should AKSHAY
stop making SETH
horror mov-
ies because
this just won everything." I've
probably called four or five
different releases in the last
year alone the best things ever
made ("Spring Breakers" was '
pretty good though), and I
have a penchant for yelling at
people who aren't on the same
page ("You haven't seen xxxx
yet? Why are you even here?").
But when all's said and done,
what do my friends know?
They're all insane.
Now that you've had this
brief glimpse into my soul, let's
talk about "Gravity." A lot of
people have been calling it the
best movie released in a very
long time, for sure the most
gripping 90 minutes of cinema
produced all year. Some have
gone as far as saying they'll
never see another film like
it in their lifetimes. To put it
lightly, the world has collec-
tively lost its shit and boarded
a massive Hubble Telescope-
sized bandwagon to space.
Coming from the dude who
loves speaking in extremes, all
of these people might be right,
but if there's something I've
learned looking at an ungodly
number of yearly top 10 lists,
it's that when it comes to sift-
ing through movie releases
and holding up The One that's
supposed to be the com-
mon denominator, there's no
verifiable certainty. The only
verifiable certainty here is that
"Gravity" is a game changer.
I use the term game changer
for two simple reasons. One:
Studios in Los Angeles that
have seen the film but aren't
actively trying to replicate, or
at least mimic, what director
Alfonso Cuar6n has accom-
plished are at risk of being left
behind. Two: Every movie that

'M' looks for win at Penn State
in battle of Big Ten powers

By BRAD WHIPPLE
Daily Sports Writer
It's always nice having momen-
tum going into a Big Ten game,
or any game for that matter. But
nothing gives you an edge quite
like the hunger for revenge.
Sunday, the No. 19 Michigan

cer team will Michan at

senior midfielder Tori McCombs.
Michigan (3-1-1 Big Ten, 9-2-1
overall) has never won a game at
Penn State's Jeffrey Field - the
Wolverines are 0-8-4 at Univer-
sity Park, while their all-time
record in the series stands at 4-17-
6. Their last win over Penn State
(4-1,10-2-1) was Oct. 4,2002,4-0.
"In some ways it makes it a
really fun game to play," said
Michigan coach Greg Ryan. "You
have something to play for that's
never been done."
The Nittany Lions are tied for
first in the Big Ten standingswith
No. 24 Nebraska while Michigan
is tied for second place with No.
20 Wisconsin.
"The obvious implication (of
winning) is that itcgives you a shot
at moving up in the Big Ten stand-
ings," Ryan said. "(It also) gives
you a chance to continue-to stride
through to win a Big Ten Confer-
ence Championship, which would
be a huge step for our program.
We know we're facing a fantastic
opponentso it's not like it is gonna
bean easy job?'
This season, the Wolverines

nents 208-121. But the team has

struggled to capitalize, convert-
ing just 11.5% of the time for 24
total goals. It has been hard for
Michigan to finish these chanc-
es, but perhaps the Wolverines'
2-1 win over Michigan State last
Thursday marks the beginning of
an upward trend.
"I think it's just getting around
the box and going as hard as
you can to get that second ball,"
McCombs said. "Those are going
to be the goals that win games.
Against Penn State, we hdve to
finish our opportunities because
they'll come early."
And Michigan has plenty of
talent to convert, mainly senior
forward Nkem Ezurike and fresh-
man forward Matisson Lewis.
Despite going scoreless for
three games before the Nebraska
game on Sunday, Ezurike needs
just three goals to break Kacy Bei-
tel's program record of 44.
Lewis is the other offensive
threat as the team's second-lead-
ing goal scorer behind Ezurike,
with four goals on the season.
She is tied for second in game-
winning goals in the Big Ten with
three.
"Madi has proven consistently

that she can compete at this level,
she can score goals at this level
and that we can count on her out
on the field," Ryan said. "I got to
be able to know who I can count
on and who has shown me that
they can handle Big Ten level
play, and Madi certainly has done
that. For a freshman, that's just
awesome."
Michigan isn't the only team
with scoring woes. Penn State
has struggled as well and was
shut out, 1-0, against Minnesota
(2-2-1, 9-3-1) on Sunday. Despite
the offensive concerns, Penn
State remains one of the strongest
teams in the Big Ten. The Nittany
Lions ended the last season by
winning the Big Ten Champion-
ship for the 15th consecutive year
and making their first trip to the
National Championship, where
they fell to No. 4 North Carolina,
4-1.
Forward Maya Hayes, the
reigning Big Ten Forward of the
Year, leads Penn State's offense
with 13 goals and five assists.
Ryan mentioned that the Nittany
Lions are a very good attacking
team - especially with Hayes'
quick speed -with wide players

players inside the box to finish off

The Wolverine defense has put
pressure on its opponents and
closed passing lanes inside the
box, making it difficult for the
competition to score. Michigan
has allowed just eight goals all
season, the best in the Big Ten,
and hasn't allowed a multi-goal
game.Assumingthe defense holds
like usual, beating Penn State will
require that the Wolverines have
confidence in front of the net to
take risks and have the mental-
ity that they can make something
happen. Ryan says that having
confidence can be the difference,
between winning and losing.
"if you looked at who scored
the goals for us in the Big Ten, it's
been the players that do have that
confidence," Ryan said. "We're
still working to help build the
confidence in our other players
because they're just so capable
at scoring goals. (We have been)
encouraging them to take risks
and don't worry about the result.
Just take the chance. If you miss,
you miss, but you've got to take
the chance."

Breakdown: Which Gardner
will show up in Happy Valley?

By LIZ VUKELICH
Daily Sports Editor
The Michigan football team is
off to a 5-0 start. But that doesn't
sit easy with fans who are still
waiting to see the resurgent Wol-
verine squad they've been prom-
ised.
Now, Michiganheads to Happy
Valley for its first true road test of
the season - and arguably one of
its toughest - to face Penn State
in the 17th meeting between the
programs.
Michigan pass offense vs. Penn
State pass defense:
Redshirt junior quarterback
Devin Gardner reached a mile-
stone in his Michigan career by
completing his first game as start-
er without throwing an intercep-
tion. It should be pointed out,
though, that offensive coordina-
tor Al Borges waited until the sec-
ond quarter against Minnesota
before having Gardner throw the
ball.
Gardner was all smiles this
week, talking about having con-
fidence in his arm again. That
being said, the Nittany Lions
have notched five interceptions
this season, and if Gardner-gets
flustered - as is very possible in
one of the loudest stadiums in col-
lege football - it won't be hard for
Penn State to tally another.
Saturday will be an indication
of whether Gardner's turnover
woes are truly under control, or

if last weekend was an aberration.
Edge: Penn State
Michigan rush offense vs. Penn
State rush defense:
After weeks of discussion
about splitting the load between
the running backs, Michigan
has finally found a better bal-
ance between fifth-year senior
,Fitzgerald Toussaint and fresh-
man Derrick Green.
The rushing yards are still
lopsided in Toussaint's favor, but
since Green has shown he can
effectively run the ball, it's not
unreasonable to expect him to
get more carries this weekend -
lessening the load on the one-man
Toussaint show.
The Nittany Lions hold their
opponents to an average of 111
rushing yards per game and rank
18th nationally in total defense.
Michigan's revamped interior
line has only been together for
one game, but against Minnesota
last week they were already more
effective at opening up holes for
Toussaint.
Edge: Michigan
Penn State pass offense vs. Mich-
igan pass defense:
Penn State's freshman quar-
terback Christian Hackenberg

for most passing attempts.
Saturday should be a perfect
opportunity for the Wolverines'
pass rush to establish itself and
live up to the preseason hype.
It won't be that easy, though, as
Penn State is big on max protec-
tion, keeping its backs and, tight
ends in.
a Defensive coordinator Greg
Mattison expressed concerns this
week about how to best defend
against Hackenberg, especially
with the blitz. In order for Michi-
gan to get its hands on Hacken-
berg, it has to beat its opponents
one-on-one. Though Mattison
didn't doubt that the Wolverines
could do it, nothing has been
shown so far this season to sug-
gest it will actually happen.
Edge: Penn State
Penn State rush offense vs. Mich-
igan rush defense:
The Wolverines still haven't
allowed a rushing touchdown
this season, but since Penn State
mostly relies on the passing game,
it's unlikely Michigan's rush
defense would have much to see
anyway - Penn State threw the
ball 55 times as opposed to 38
rushes against Indiana Saturday.
Running back Zach Zwinak is
the Nittany Lions' leading rusher,
with eight touchdowns this sea-

at one point had all but lost the
confidence of the coaches a few
weeks ago, proved himself a little
more last week against Minne-
sota. He now averages almost 40
yards per punt. Fifth-year senior
Brendan Gibbons is 4-of-5 on field
goals on the season.
Penn State's punter matches up
the same way, and its kicker has
the same field-goal percentage as
well.Veteran punt returner Drew
Dileo's seven yards per return
matches up evenly with the Nit-
tany Lions as well.
Edge: Push
Intangibles:
It doesn't get much bigger than
a prime-time white out at Beaver
Stadium.
For as much as Michigan said
it prepared using Borges' s whis-
per technique to compensate for
the ground-shaking noise, it still
doesn't make up for the fact that
very few of the Wolverines have
ever traveled to such an electric
environment.
Michigan has struggled might-
ily on the road thus far in Hoke's
tenure. Happy Valley won't likely
be the place where that turns
around. And though the Wol-
verines pan out better on paper,
statistics won't mean anything if
they can't keep their composure
in a hostile environment.

After promising improvement

ines squad delivered with a lop-

last weekend. In order to remain

The Nittany ESPN
Lions have won
the last two
meetings in State College, and
the last three overall. Before that,
though, Michigan had won nine in
a row. To prepare for the unfriend-
ly environment, the Wolverines'
offense slfent Tuesday's practice
by speaking in whispers to simu-
late how difficult it will be to hear
over the crowd.
Michigan's offense made seri-
ous progress against the Golden
Gophers, spurred by several
changes, both tactical and person-
nel-related.
First, and most notably, sopho-
more tight end Devin Funchess
spent significantly more time
than usual split out wide. His
size - Funchess stands at 6-foot-
5 - allowed him to exploit mis-
matches against the Minnesota
secondary as he exploded for a
career-high151 receiving yards.
"His role is expanded a little
bit," said offensive coordinator Al
Borges on Tuesday. "But it's still
pretty much in line with what
we've been trying to do with him
since he's been here."
Whether Funchess will con-
tinue to be on the outside, return
to his usual tight end position or
line up behind the line of scrim-
mage in what Michigan calls the

'H' position remains to be seen.
But Funchess figures to have a sig-
nificant height advantage over the
Nittany Lions secondary as well,
which could mean a similar role
for him this week.
Likewise, the offensive line
combination strung together over
the bye week - with redshirt
sophomore Chris Bryant enter-
ing the mix at guard, and redshirt
junior Graham Glasgow sliding
over the center to replace redshirt
junior Jack*Miller - appeared to
be a step -in the right direction.
Borges said Bryant "had some first
start stuff that I think any guys
would experience, but he played
hard."
It seems likely that the offen-
sive line will remain the same-this
weekend, hoping to finally spring
fifth-year senior running back
Fitzgerald Toussaint to his first
100-yard rushing game.
Another way the offense will
look to test Penn State's defense,
particularly its always-solid line-
backing corps, is with freshman
tailback Derrick Green. After
eating clock in the season opener
against Central Michigan, Green
received some meaningful car-
ries against Minnesota, especially
early in the game before the out-
come had been decided.
The coaching staff would love
to be able to mix in Green to keep
Toussaint as fresh as possible.
How he fares early against Penn
State could determine he contin-
ues to carry the ball late in the
game if it's close.
"Here's the deal with that:
when you have a young back,
you're going to play him earlier if
you're going to play him," Borges
said. "If the game's close, you're
going to get scared."
Saturday could mark the 2013
debut ofredshirt juniorlinebacker
Jake Ryan, who tore his anterior
cruciate ligament in spring prac-
tice. The status of Ryan, who is
likely the team's best defensive
player, remains questionable, and
Hoke said a decision might not
come until Saturday.

What to Watch For: Penn State

By EVERETT COOK
Daily Sports Editor
1. What does Michigan's early
game play-calling look like?
Last week against Minnesota,
Michigan didn't throw a single
pass in the first quarter. Offen-
sive coordinator Al Borges said
it was the first time in his Michi-
gan career that he didn't call a
pasg play for the first 15 minutes.
Part of that was the time of
possession - Minnesota had the
ball for more than 10 minutes in
the first quarter, which limited
Michigan to eight plays - but
part of it was a rededication to
the power run game. Michigan's
six-play first drive went 35 yards
for a touchdown, and all six plays
were runs.
This rendered redshirt junior
quarterback Devin Gardner basi-
cally useless for the first quarter.
When he did start throwing,
though, he played one of the most
efficient games of his career. He
had a turnover-free game for the
first time ever and had just four
incompletion en route to 235
yards and a touchdown.
For the first time this sea-
son, Michigan's offense wasn't
dependent on Gardner making
plays. All the Wolverines need-

ed him to do was be an efficient
game manager, a role that he
thrived in.
So on Saturday, in one of
Michigan's biggest road contests
of the year, where will Borges
put the ball? Into the hands of a
quarterback with a habit of turn-
overs buta propensity for incred-
ible plays, or into the hands of
the running backs?
2. Does Derrick Green get more
than 10 carries?
Yes, that was "running backs"
with an "s." It's no longer strict-
ly fifth-year senior Fitzgerald
Toussaint - freshman running
back Derrick Green has officially
arrived as a change-of-pace back
guaranteed to get some carries.
Against the Gophers, Green ran
the ball 10 times, the most car-
ries he's received since Central
Michigan.
This week, Borges said that
he likes the idea of giving Green
more carries, as a way to make
sure Toussaint - who is a season
removed from a broken leg -
isn't tired by the end of the game.
Green started the season off
a little heavier than Michigan
coach Brady Hoke would have
preferred but has slimmed down
to around 235 pounds. He's still

a cannon ball, hitting holes hard
making him an ideal short-yard-
age or red-zone running back
and an effective complement
Toussaint.
Against Penn State, look for
Green to pick up even more of
the workload early on in the
game. If Borges sticks to the run-
ning game, Green will be a part
of it.

And frankly, Funchess has
never been known for his block-
ing. When he's split out wide and
no longer on the line, blocking
rushers is no longer an issue.
A big issue for the offense all
year is getting production out a
wide receiver that isn't fifth-year
senior Jeremy Gallon. Funchess
in a new role might solve that
problem.

3. Does Devin Funchess line up 4. How deep do Michigan's line-
primarily as a wide receiver or backers play?
signs ,..en

tight end?
When Gardner did throw, it
was primarily to his sophomore
tight end. Funchess had his
best game in a Michigan uni-
form, catching seven passes for
151 yards and a touchdown. He
caught more catches than the
rest of the team combined.
Much of that success stemmed
from Borges' decision to push
Funchess out wide, playing more
as a wide receiver than a tight
end. At times, he returned to
his traditional tight-end spot,
but his big gains came from the
outside. Funchess is 6-foot-5 and
one of the best athletes on the
roster. Getting him in open space
creates mismatches that even
the best defensive coordinators
can't plan for.

Michigan's defense struggled
against the short passing game
against UConn three weeks ago
because of linebackers playing
too close to the line of scrim-
mage. They couldn't recover.
Last week, Michigan gave
up third-down conversions and
quarterback scrambles galore
because the linebackers were
playing too deep.
So where's the solid middle?
Against Penn State's pocket-
passing quarterback, Christian
Hackenberg, it might be the lat-
ter. He's not a threat to run, and
it might be more beneficial to
have bodies in the passing game.
Ideally, the linebacking corps
finds a way to do both. Whether
that transition happens by Satur-
day, though, remains to be seen.

Andrew Copp made himself a
promise. Named an alternate cap-
tain by Michigan hockey coach
Red Berenson, the sophomore for-
ward vowed to contribute more
to avoid a BC 1
repeatofthe MICHIGAN 3
crushing
disappointment of last season.
And on Thursday night, Copp
and No. 10 Michigan notched
a statement victory at Yost Ice
Arena by topping No. 4 Boston
College, 3-1, in both teams' regu-
lar-season openers.
Copp finished with three
points on the night, highlighted

by a shot deflected off a Boston
College player five minutes into
the second period to give the Wol-
verines (1-0) a 2-0 lead. And just
moments into the third period,
after the Eagles (0-1) had cut the
deficit to one goal beforethe inter-
mission, Copp's pinpoint assist
to senior forward Luke Moffatt
helped restore Michigan's two-
goal advantage - one it would not
relinquish.
"That's what we're looking for,"
Berenson said. "(Copp) is a big
kid, he competes hard, he wants
to play at both ends of the rink,
and that's how we want our whole
team to play. But Andrew Copp is
not just a sophomore now - he's
one of our captains, and he's play-

ing like it."
The Wolverines struck early
when freshman forward JT Com-
pher and Moffatt combined on
the power play seven minutes into
the first period. Singlehandedly
breaking into the offensive zone,
Compher avoided two defen-
semen before sliding the puck
across the crease. Unmarked,
Moffatt one-timed it past Billett.
"It's definitely good to get the
first one out of the way always,"
Moffatt said. "Definitely good to
getJT'(Compher) his first point as
a freshman, and I feel like we got
the ball rolling early this year."
Moffat had a pair of goals, and
Compher had two assists as part
of Michigan's second line.

The Eagles' lone tally came
midway through the second peri-
od. Forward Johnny Gaudreau
fed defenseman Ian McCoshen,
and his slap shot from the blue
line made its way past sophomore
netminder Steve Racine after
being tipped by a defender. Ryan
Fitzgerald nearly brought Boston
College all the way back from the
two-goal hole on a breakaway
moments later, but his back-
handed wrist shot clanged off the
frame.
The Eagles' threatening sec-
ond period highlighted Racine's
solid night between the pipes.
The goaltender was the benefac-
tor of a lucky break when Boston
College forward Quinn Smith hit

the post despite having an open
net in the first period, but he
recovered quickly enough to poke
away the rebound. When forward
Austin Cangelosi snuck in behind
the Wolverines' defense and had
a prime goal-scoring opportu-
nity with four minutes to go in
the first period, Racine stuffed
him cleanly. And the netminder's
quick snag on an odd-man break
in the final frame preserved the
two-goal lead.
"That's what we need from
him," Berenson said. "He went
through his learning curve last
year, and hopefully now he'll be
more consistent."
After the disappointment of
the exhibition against Waterloo,

where the Wolverines went 0-for-
5 with the man advantage, Beren-
son warned that the power play
might not be up to par this early
in the season. It was a different
story on Friday, as both of Mof-
fatt's goals came on a dangerous
and versatile power play that fin-
ished 2-for-S.
Even more reassuring was the
fact that Michigan played without
junior forward Alex Guptill - last
season's leading scorer - who sat
out due to an unspecified viola-
tion of team rules.,
It didn't seem to matter,
though, as the Wolverines fired
32 shots and found twine in every 4
period as Copp's three-point
night secured the win.

Racine shines in opener

PAUL SHERMAN/Daily
Sophomore forward Andrew Copp finished with three points, including a goal.

Less than two minutes into
the No. 10 Michigan hockey
team's season opener against No.
4 Boston College, a lone stick lay
unclaimed on the ice after a scuf-
fle - a sign of things to come.
After 60 minutes of predict-
ably brutal hockey and solid play
from both teams, it was stellar
goaltending - from sophomore
Steve Racine that preserved the
Wolverines' 3-1 victory.
Racine - who allowed two
goals in an abbreviated appear-
ance in Sunday's exhibition -
finished the game with 20 saves,
including nine in the first period,
and allowed only one goal.
Much of Racine's success was
a product of limited rebounds.
Racine was able to sit on several
in-traffic shots, at times with
opposing players fallen in goal.
Late in the third period, he made
a quick glove save on an odd-man
rush.
In front of him, Racine had
the support of the penalty kill
all night. The defense held the
Eagles to just two shots on the
power play and to just 21 on the
game.
"He was awesome," said soph-
omore forward Andrew Copp.
"He's been working out all sum-
mer so we knew where he was at
mentally and physically. It's good
for him. It gets him a lot of con-
fidence to keep the ball rolling
from last year."
While Racine was the better
netminder, he was also luckier.
Three times in the second period,
Racine was mere inches from
allowing a goal, and three shots
in particular could have gotten
Boston College back in the game.


In the first period, Racine
juggled a puck in traffic that all
but jumped out of the goal by
itself. Racine got an even luckier
break in the second period, when
a shot from Eagles forward Ryan
Fitzgerald bounced off the cross-
bar, narrowly misting an upper-
corner goal. Once more with
three minutes remaining, having
made a left-pad save, Racine lost
sight of the puck and left the net
open for a moment for Fitzgerald,
who missed wide.
Meanwhile, Boston College
goaltender Brian Billett finished
the game with 29 saves having
allowed three goals - two of
which were a result of a sleepy
penalty kill, and another off a
deflection..Billett also spent 12
minutes defending the net with
four men.
"I thought our goaltender
played really, really well," said
Boston College coach Jerry York.
"We're going to have a strong
year this year in the net."
Despite the errors, the stat
sheet showed Racine allowed
a single goal against one of the
nation's top offenses, and the
defense held the Eagles' best
player, junior forward Johnny
Gaudreau, to one shot. It was a
game that will build confidence
not only inRacine, but in a young
Wolverines defense moving for-
ward as well.
"I think that's what we
expect," said Michigan coach
Red Berenson. "If you're at Mich-
igan, you know you need good
goalkeeping. Look what he did
last year. I think he was 8-1-1 in
the last 10 games. That's what we
need from him. He went through
his learning curve last year, and
hopefully now he'll be more con-
sistent."
