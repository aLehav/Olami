Civil rights activist Reverend Al 

Sharpton called on the University 

of Michigan to release a report on 

the number of African Americans 

involved in the management of 

the school’s endowment in a letter 

to 
University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel and Chief Investment 

Officer Erik Lundberg last month.

Sharpton, writing on behalf 

of his organization, the National 

Action 
Network, 
requested 

diversity data both on University 

staff managing the endowment 

and 
leadership 
of 
the 
asset 

management firms the University 

works with.

Citing 
numerous 
studies 

that show women and people 

of color are underrepresented 

in 
asset 
management 
despite 

performing at the same level as 

their peers, Sharpton argued that 

increasing diversity is not just a 

matter of moral responsibility, 

but 
“a 
question 
of 
fiduciary 

responsibility.”

“If a trustees’ responsibility 

is to maximize returns, why are 

elite institutions using women 

and people of color at palpably low 

rates?” Sharpton wrote. 

Robert Sellers, vice provost for 

equity and inclusion and chief 

diversity officer at the University, 

responded to Sharpton’s letter 

by reaffirming the University’s 

commitment to diversity, equity 

and inclusion.

“The University is currently in 

the midst of a planning process 

where every school, college and 

campus unit created a diversity, 

equity, and inclusion strategic 

plan addressing its unique local 

needs and opportunities,” wrote 

Sellers. 

Sharpton 
cited 
a 
December 

University of California report on its 

diverse investment strategy as a model 

for the University and institutions 

across the country. The report detailed 

the UC Investment Office’s workforce 

diversity trends by racial and gender 

makeup, the number of minority- and 

women-owned investment partners 

and a qualitative survey of diversity 

and inclusion approaches at 15 of its 

largest investment partner firms. 

Instead of leaving Ann Arbor 

to go home, Nursing junior Rachel 

Quigley still works as a nurse’s 

aide at the University of Michigan 

Hospital to fill the growing need 

for health professionals during the 

coronavirus pandemic. She said, 

in light of her lung condition, it’s 

reassuring to see the hospital taking 

extra precautions to keep their staff 

on campus safe. 

“I love my job and the experience 

especially right now, it’s interesting 

to see how the hospital is handling 

the 
situation, 
and 
what 
my 

future workplace may look like if 

something like this were to ever 

happen again,” Quigley said. “I’m 

kind of worried about getting the 

virus but I trust the PPE (personal 

protective equipment). I have a 

lung condition so I can’t work with 

COVID patients, and they’re taking 

extra precautions in making sure 

everyone is safe.”

Quigley 
said 
campus 
looks 

vacant as people seem to be social 

distancing properly to help curb the 

pandemic.

“The campus looks very empty 

and bare, it’s really sad,” Quigley 

said. “If you walk into the Diag or 

near the other buildings on campus, 

it just feels kind of wrong … I’m 

glad though to see people social 

distancing. I’ll see when people are 

talking from different houses or 

groups, they are far apart. It looks 

like people are actually taking 

it seriously. And if people are 

partying, it looks like it’s just their 

housemates in their front yards.”

TARA MOORE 

Senior Account Exeucutive

Engineering junior Simrun Buttar 

is still living on campus, primarily to 

keep her family members back home 

safe.

“My grandma lives at home with me 

in California and I’m kind of worried if 

I’m not absolutely sure I don’t have (the 

coronavirus), that I don’t positively put 

any member of my family member in 

danger,” Buttar said.

Buttar said it’s also helpful to be 

on campus for one of her engineering 

courses, which requires an extensive 

amount of understanding.

“It’s a class where I really struggle 

to learn the concepts, and I’ve tried 

a lot to go virtual with it, where my 

group member is in his apartment and 

I’m in mine,” Buttar said. “But, I feel 

it’s not the same substitutability as us 

being in-person.”

One difficulty she has faced with 

living off-campus is getting food, she 

explained. Buttar cannot get groceries 

as she normally would as she doesn’t 

have a car, Instacart is already working 

with a high volume of deliveries and 

the rental car services in Ann Arbor, 

like Maven, shut down due to COVID-

19. She said she has since been using a 

meal plan at South Quad.

“Usually I’d just go to MoJo because 

it’s a lot closer to me and it’s my favorite 

dining hall,” Buttar said. “But now I’ll 

make the trek over to South Quad just 

because it’s the only one open, and I’m 

mindful of the groceries I still have 

because I know restocking it will be a 

challenge.”

Still, Buttar reflected on how an 

empty campus has allowed her to 

restart some of her old hobbies. For 

instance, she said she has recently 

started knitting again, ordered a paint-

by-numbers set and started watching 

TV shows to keep herself busy.

University alum Markeidus Hall 

worked at Markley Dining Hall until 

it closed due to the novel coronavirus. 

He stayed in Ann Arbor in his off-

campus housing to not put his mother, 

who has a compromised immune 

system, at risk. He said his time spent 

outside and exercise have dropped 

significantly given the stay-at-home 

order.

“Before everything closed, I was 

definitely playing basketball at the 

CCRB (Central Campus Recreation 

Building) and doing outdoor activities 

and stuff,” Hall said. “I also got a 

decent amount of walking in getting 

(to) and working at Markley Dining 

Hall, too, before it closed and they 

recommended us to stay at home ... 

Now, it’s basically a ghost town out 

there. The most exercise I get is pacing 

back and forth in my room.”

Hall graduated early last semester 

and reflected on the difficulties 

affecting his classmates graduating in 

the spring given the postponement of 

commencement and other activities 

pertaining to graduation.

Michigan Medicine receives 
22,000 unusable surgical masks

Defunct supplies from federal stockpile sent to hospital amid virus outreak

As part of its effort to curb the 

impact of COVID-19, the federal 

government 
shipped 
more 
than 

700,000 surgical masks to the state of 

Michigan last week from its stockpile. 

Michigan Medicine received 22,000 

of those masks, but they are defunct, 

the Detroit Free Press reported on 

Tuesday. 

Michigan Medicine spokeswoman 

Mary Masson told The Daily in an 

email that 2,000 of these masks were 

initially distributed to employees, but 

they, along with the remaining 20,000, 

were quickly removed from inventory 

after discovering they were less 

durable. She noted Michigan Medicine 

has enough masks without them. 

“Michigan Medicine distributed 

about 2,000 of 22,000 ear loop masks 

we received from the strategic national 

stockpile last week,” Masson said. “We 

found them to be less durable and so 

have removed as many as possible from 

inventory and are not distributing the 

rest. We currently have an adequate 

supply of face masks so we were able to 

provide others to our staff.”

This 
comes 
after 
Michigan 

Medicine nurses have expressed their 

frustration about the lack of personal 

protective equipment and the fact they 

are not allowed to bring their own 

personal protective equipment, such 

as N95 masks, to work. 

Michigan 
reported 
27,001 

confirmed cases of COVID-19 on April 

14, with 772 of those in Washtenaw 

County. 

As of April 7, more than 100 

Michigan 
Medicine 
employees 

have tested positive for the novel 

coronavirus. 

Michigan, however, is not the only 

state to receive unusable equipment 

from the federal stockpile. Alabama 

received 6,000 masks with dry rot and 

150 of the ventilators sent to California 

were broken.

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer 

engaged in a public conversation 

with President Donald Trump from 

late March to early April where the 

two exchanged criticisms of their 

respective handling of the pandemic. 

Whitmer asked for supplies from 

the federal government, including 

protective equipment and testing kits. 

Out of the 25,000 ventilators requested 

by Whitmer, she received 400 from the 

federal stockpile, as of April 7. 

The Centers for Disease Control 

and Prevention recommends people 

wash their hands often and avoid 

touching their faces. Anyone who 

believes they have been exposed to 

COVID-19 should call their primary 

care physician or reach out to the 

local health department, which in 

Washtenaw County can be reached at 

734-544-6700.

News
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Challengers to Eaton include 

Jen Eyer, a former journalist for 

MLive and the Ann Arbor News, 

and Mozhgan Savabieasfahani, an 

environmental toxicologist. 

Erica 
Briggs 
and 
Dan 

Michniewicz are running for the 

Ward 5 seat, which is currently 

occupied by Chip Smith, D-Ward 

5. All candidates participated in 

the forum.

Jack Eaton, Democrat for 

Ward 4 

Eaton, who ran unsuccessfully 

for mayor of Ann Arbor in 2018, 

was first elected to the council in 

2013 and then re-elected in 2015 

and 2017. 

Eaton said he has been working 

with various local Ann Arbor 

groups such as the Huron Valley 

Area Labor Federation and local 

civil rights groups to further his 

campaign.

“I believe that residents and 

voters in Ann Arbor deserve to 

be listened to and that the duty 

of an elected official is to weigh 

all of the diverse opinions that 

people have and to do the best to 

address the concerns of everyone, 

not just their supporters,” Eaton 

said. “My core issues have always 

been 
the 
environment, 
labor 

and employment issues and civil 

rights.”

Eaton 
said 
he 
supports 

addressing 
affordability 
issues 

in Ann Arbor. To do so, he said 

the city must focus on only 

constructing buildings that are 

needed and should not support 

unnecessary housing proposals.

“When we removed all the 

barriers 
to 
development 
in 

our 
downtown 
area 
without 

making 
any 
requirements 
of 

the developers, what we ended 

up with was high priced luxury 

apartments,” Eaton said. “We 

have since revisited the zoning 

in those areas and required that 

tall buildings and dense buildings 

include some affordable units and 

some other considerations.”

Jen Eyer, Democrat for Ward 

4

Eyer said she has worked with 

the Michigan Municipal League 

Foundation for the past year on 

their SaveMICity campaign. She 

said 
the 
campaign 
highlights 

Michigan’s 
broken 
system 
of 

municipal finance. 

Eyer also said the SaveMICity 

campaign shines a light on how 

Proposal 
A, 
which 
addresses 

how public schools in Michigan 

are funded, and the Headlee 

Amendment, 
which 
placed 

limitations 
on 
the 
collection 

of 
local 
taxes 
among 
other 

provisions, have played off of each 

other.

“Frankly, the state’s lack of 

sharing revenue with cities, to the 

extent that they’re supposed to — 

those things have all combined 

with 
Michigan 
cities 
being 

chronically underfunded,” Eyer 

said. “ … That’s going to get worse 

in the next year because of the 

COVID pandemic.”

During 
the 
coronavirus 

pandemic, 
Eyer 
said 
she 
is 

connecting with citizens, listening 

to issues they are facing and trying 

to find a solution to their problems.

“I was a journalist for many 

years,” Eyer said. “In that role, 

it was my job to use technology 

to reach out to various people’s 

organizations, different segments 

of the community and engage 

them with our reporting and also 

figure out what the issues were 

in their lives that we may want to 

report on.”

Mozhgan 
Savabieasfahani, 

Democrat for Ward 4

Savabieasfahani, a contestant 

speaking at City Council meetings 

and a participant in anti-Israel 

protests, said she has heard the 

council 
talk 
about 
affordable 

housing for as long as she has lived 

in Ann Arbor. Despite this ongoing 

discussion, Savabieasfahani said 

she does not believe affordable 

housing exists in the city and 

supports the implementation of 

public housing.

“I know public housing to the 

ear of Americans will sort of 

bring in mind dilapidated homes 

with crimes, et cetera, et cetera,” 

Savabieasfahani said. “But that is 

basically because the real estate 

industry has been pushing against 

public housing and has been very 

much against it, and that’s the 

result that you see here. However, 

public housing is the best way that 

we can make sure that people have 

a roof over their heads.”

During 
the 
forum, 

Savabieasfahani placed a large 

focus 
on 
the 
importance 
of 

establishing a minimum wage of 

$15 per hour. Savabieasfahani said 

this will help make Ann Arbor a 

more livable city for its residents.

“I am basically saying we must 

provide a much better living 

environment for our low-income 

population. Otherwise, COVID-

19 and many more epidemics that 

are on the way are going to break 

our back as they are breaking our 

backs now,” Savabieasfahani said. 

“We need to make sure that people 

who work in this town can get $15 

an hour.”

Savabieasfahani also mentioned 

her platform focuses on making 

sure Ann Arbor has enough money 

in its budget to run smoothly.

Erica Briggs, Democrat for 

Ward 5

Briggs, a walking and cycling 

advocate in the city, said she 

supports increased density in 

places like Ann Arbor. She said 

more 
density 
offers 
multiple 

benefits, such as better options for 

transportation and more housing.

“When you have more people 

grouped together, you have more 

services,” Briggs said. “I like the 

idea of neighborhoods where you 

can go to the corner grocery, you 

can go to that, go to a bakery, go 

to a department store. That’s only 

enabled by density.”

Throughout her career, Briggs 

said 
she 
has 
worked 
almost 

entirely in transportation. She 

said investing in alternate modes 

of transportation will help achieve 

the city’s goal of reaching carbon 

neutrality by 2030 through the 

A2Zero plan, which was launched 

March 30.

Briggs also talked about the 

coronavirus. She said citizens will 

be facing financial distress due 

to the pandemic long after the 

outbreak dies down.

“Evictions have been put off 

for now, but I’m really worried 

for when this stay-at-home order 

gets lifted. We’ll see hundreds and 

hundreds of folks evicted across 

our community,” Briggs said. “I 

think that’s something that our 

city council needs to be working 

on.”

Dan Michniewicz, Democrat 

for Ward 5

Michniewicz, who is a baker at 

Zingerman’s Bakehouse, said he is 

currently furloughed from his job 

baking bread. He said he has made 

a living working in restaurants, 

delis and kitchens since living in 

Ann Arbor. 

“There’s 84,000 people who 

commute to Ann Arbor every 

day, and don’t you think some of 

them would like to live in Ann 

Arbor?” Michniewicz said. “And 

I say to that, well, I work with 

these people. I organize politically 

with people of this economic 

stature. And we can do a better 

job of advocating for our own 

interests and advancing our own 

causes than our current political 

leadership can.”

Michniewicz said his platform 

focuses on ecological action and 

economic inequality. Michniewicz 

also 
placed 
an 
emphasis 
on 

housing in Ann Arbor and making 

sure that all of the land is used to 

its full potential.

“I’m 
going 
to 
prioritize 

the creation of social housing 

like we see through the Ann 

Arbor 
Housing 
Commission,” 

Michniewicz said. “I’m somewhat 

pleased with the route that the 

current city council is taking by 

looking at things like surface-

level parking lot property that we 

already own, and figuring out how 

we can maximize the amount of 

affordable housing that we put on 

those lots.”

A forum for candidates from 

Wards 1, 2 and 3 will be held at 

2:30 p.m. on Thursday and will be 

broadcast on the CTN Network. 

Elections 
for 
city

FORUM
From Page 1A

In an interview with The 

Daily, Sharpton offered advice to 

students on how to advocate for 

the University to lead on diverse 

asset management as well. 

“They 
should 
demand 

transparency and they should 

demand to know,” Sharpton said. 

“If they, in fact, get the data and 

there is not enough diversity, 

they should demand that there 

be an aggressive move to try and 

correct that without sacrificing 

the return on investment.”

Sharpton told The Daily that 

reporting on the diversity of 

asset management would help the 

University sustain its investments 

while growing closer to its core 

values of diversity, equity and 

inclusion. 

“One, it could bring them 

people that could perform better, 

so they would benefit financially,” 

Sharpton said. “And second, it 

would show that they frankly 

practice what they preach ... It 

should be firms that can show that 

they can outperform or perform 

at the level of those agencies or 

companies that they were already 

dealing with. We’re not asking for 

charity here, but we’re asking for 

a lack of exclusion, and there must 

be an aggressive move toward 

that end.” 

Robert Raben, founder and 

president of the consulting firm 

The Raben Group, founded the 

Diverse Asset Managers Initiative 

in 2014 and works with NAN to 

increase the number of, and assets 

under management by, minority- 

and 
women-owned 
asset 

management firms, according to 

its website. He praised the UC 

report for being the first of its 

kind among major universities. 

“I 
give 
them 
nothing 
but 

points,” 
Raben 
said. 
“Their 

numbers are low and they still 

put them out because they want to 

improve, whereas Michigan won’t 

even engage in the conversation.”

According 
to 
Raben, 

universities are the last major 

entity in the economy to widely 

release data on asset management 

diversity. 

“There’s something very odd 

going on that an entire field 

won’t even talk about whether it’s 

working with women or people of 

color,” Raben said.

The University’s endowment 

was valued at $12.4 billion in 

June 2019, the ninth-largest in 

the country and third-largest 

among 
public 
universities 

nationwide. Sharpton also sent 

letters 
to 
other 
institutions 

with large endowments such as 

Yale 
University 
and 
Harvard 

University. 

Raben said he believes lobbying 

large, established universities will 

create a domino effect in diverse 

asset management reporting.

“There’s 
hundreds 
of 

billions of dollars in university 

endowments,” Raben said. “Our 

theory is that if Cal and Harvard 

and Michigan and Cornell and 

Stanford, Texas, etc. recognize 

that they’re missing out on talent 

and performance, then the rest of 

the field will follow. So, number 

one, we’re dealing with Michigan 

because of its importance in the 

field.”

Student 
activism 
led 
the 

University to freeze new fossil 

fuel investments in February, a 

first for a Big Ten school. 

Diverse asset management is not 

an easy ask for chief investment 

officers, according to Raben. He 

said firms that university asset 

managers 
already 
work 
with 

have an incumbency advantage, 

making it hard for diverse-owned 

firms to enter investment pools. 

“If I was persuaded that I 

should work with people of color 

or women, it means I would have 

to take $100 million or $500 

million from somebody,” Raben 

said. “There’s no new money. And 

so it would mean that the CIO 

would have to go to JP Morgan 

or Carlyle or KKR or whomever 

it’s been working with for 20 

years, and say ‘I want to move 100 

million or 500 million from you to 

a Black asset manager.’” 

The 
University’s 
website 

states the endowment is shielded 

from “political pressures” and 

investment decisions are based 

solely 
on 
financial 
factors. 

Additionally, Schlissel told The 

Daily in a Feb. 25 interview he 

doesn’t believe the University 

should shift the direction of 

endowment funds in response to 

the political beliefs of the student 

body. 

“I 
think 
that’s 
both 

inappropriate and very risky,” 

Schlissel said. “You know, in a 

world where we value free speech 

and we value diversity, I think I 

can disagree with the owner of a 

business but still do business with 

the business. So, I don’t think 

those things should enter into 

investment decisions at all.” 

Raben’s 
initiative 
recently 

surveyed the top 30 investment 

consulting firms in the nation 

on their diversity data. However, 

he 
said 
conversations 
with 

University 
officials 
have 
not 

been as productive as those with 

private industry. 

“When I talked to (Lundberg) 

two years ago, he told me that 

he was willing to work with us, 

but he also told us that he didn’t 

engage in social engineering,” 

Raben said. “I took offense to that. 

I said, ‘I don’t think working with 

talented people of color is social 

engineering.’ He said his board, 

his Regents instructed him not 

to engage in social engineering. 

And I said, ‘If you’re only curating 

white people, would you consider 

that social engineering?’ He did 

not respond.” 

University spokesperson Rick 

Fitzgerald did not offer further 

comment on Raben’s conversation 

with Lundberg.

Lundberg’s 2019-2020 salary 

was $850,000, the sixth-highest 

at the University, according to 

the 
annual 
Salary 
Disclosure 

Report. Raben noted that CIOs 

are often among the highest-

paid officials in universities and 

said their decisions are typically 

unquestioned by asset managers 

and trustees. 

“This is the mindset of some of 

these CIOs, that a conversation 

about working with people of color 

is some sort of social experiment, 

like it’s 1941,” Raben said. “In 

every other area of American 

economic life, corporate boards, 

c-suites, employment — white 

people don’t quibble with the 

premise of diversity anymore. 

Nobody quibbles with whether or 

not having Black people, Hispanic 

people in your employment is a bad 

idea. But in asset management, 

and the CIO of Michigan, they 

dispute the premise. They don’t 

think it matters whether or 

not talented people of color are 

included. And I’m just astounded 

by that.”

LETTER
From Page 1A


N

obody should have to choose 

between their vote and 

their health, but Wisconsin 

voters faced this decision due to 

reckless and politically-motivated 

actions taken by the Republican 

Party and a complicit United States 

Supreme Court. 

As 
COVID-19 
forces 
stay-at-

home orders and social distancing, 

numerous states have postponed 

their primary elections in the name 

of public health. This is the right 

decision. Having people leave their 

homes in the middle of a pandemic 

and gather en masse at polling places, 

interacting with others and touching 

shared surfaces, is clearly a recipe 

for disaster. 

In order to protect his constituents, 

Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers tried to 

postpone the state’s primary election 

until June. However, the GOP had 

other plans.

The GOP sued to keep the April 

7 election date, taking the case all 

the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. 

In a five to four ideological split, 

the conservative justices voted to 

allow the election to be held on the 

original date. Justice Ruth Bader 

Ginsberg, joined by the other three 

liberal justices, dissented, saying 

that continuing to hold the election 

“will result in massive 

disenfranchisement.”

This 

disenfranchisement 

of voters was clear 

during Election Day. 

Fears over COVID-

19 led to a shortage 

of poll workers and 

widespread 
poll 

closures. Milwaukee, 

a diverse city with 

about 
600,000 

residents, had their 

usual 
180 
polling 

places reduced to just five. This 

led to hours-long lines with people 

having to wait outside during bouts 

of rain and hail. Overall turnout was 

down significantly from 49 percent 

in the 2016 primary to 31 percent. 

This lower turnout can in part be 

attributed to only one party having 

a 
competitive 
primary, 
but 
the 

influence of COVID-19 can also not 

be overlooked.

Though Wisconsin has no-excuse 

absentee voting, which allows people 

to vote via mail instead of in-person 

and is one of the most promising 

ways to vote during a pandemic, 

Wisconsin’s system has many issues. 

Some voters did not receive their 

absentee ballots despite requesting 

them. Another major issue was 

that the appeals court upheld a 

requirement that every person who 

submits an absentee ballot must have 

a witness sign their ballot before it 

can be returned. For people who are 

self-isolating or live alone, this can 

be a major barrier to voting. 

The inability for some people 

to vote was not a coincidence, 

it was a coordinated strategy to 

disenfranchise 
certain 
voters. 

COVID-19 is mostly concentrated in 

the urban areas in Wisconsin, such 

as Milwaukee. Therefore, many of 

the less diverse suburban and rural 

areas did not experience the same 

poll closures and fears compared to 

the larger, more diverse cities. It is 

evident that holding the in-person 

election was a thinly veiled action 

on the part of the state GOP to 

disenfranchise diverse voters who 

overwhelmingly support Democrats.

The 
most 
important 
race 
on 

the ballot was not the Democratic 

primary, instead, it was a Wisconsin 

state Supreme Court race. There is 

currently a lawsuit pending before 

the court about a move by the state 

legislature 
to 
purge 
more 
than 

200,000 voters from the voter rolls. 

The decision will have repercussions 

for the 2020 election, given that 

President 
Donald 
Trump 
won 

Wisconsin by exactly one percent in 

2016. The purging of the voter rolls 

is a move by the GOP to help Trump 

and once again disenfranchise young 

people and minorities. Wisconsin 

voters 
clearly 
understood 
the 

importance of this race, as they 

elected the Democratic 

judicial candidate in a 

shocking upset. 

As 
infuriating 
and 

saddening as it was to 

witness this blatant act 

of 
voter 
suppression, 

it was still inspiring to 

see 
voters 
determined 

to exercise their basic 

rights. These were people 

who 
were 
willing 
to 

struggle for their vote. 

They were willing to 

stand for hours in the 

rain and the hail. They were willing 

to put their own safety at risk all to 

exercise their right to vote. 

However, there is something that 

we all can learn from this. So often 

when I talk to people on campus about 

voting, they say it is too hard or too 

complicated. We don’t know “hard.” 

“Hard” is knowing that you can either 

put your life at risk and go to the polls 

or stay home but allow the fraudulent 

election of a judge who may take away 

your right to vote. Going to the polls 

took courage. So many people in this 

country and around the world cannot 

vote, but they would — and often do — 

risk it all for that right. 

So the next time there is an election 

and you aren’t sure if you want to 

take the time to vote, think about 

the people who went to the polls in 

Wisconsin. Let their courage inspire 

you to participate in our democracy in 

a way that many people cannot.

The sacred vote

T

he coronavirus pandemic 

began as a murmur of 

distant 
contagion. 

Like many other newsworthy 

tragedies, it seems unreal and 

somehow unthreatening until 

it happens to you. The world 

has been shocked by a wave 

of uncertainty. People were 

ripped from their comfortable 

nooks of life and normalcy 

with no warning, no time to 

process. As a student on the 

big, bustling University of 

Michigan campus, my daily 

routine has shifted largely. 

However, 
I’ve 
chosen 
to 

develop a positive perspective 

on my new reality — a decision 

I know is a privilege not 

everyone has the opportunity 

to make in this unprecedented 

time. My routine can continue, 

and 
there 
are 
even 
new 

possibilities that were not 

available to me in Ann Arbor 

(beyond that of quality New 

Jersey bagels and access to 

Wawa coffee). I’ve found peace 

in a new perspective and the 

prospect of technology. 

With stay-at-home orders 

restricting many from leaving 

their 
homes, 
it 
becomes 

increasingly challenging to 

make days feel anything but 

mundane. It was not until a 

week ago that I realized the 

importance of something I had 

completely 
underestimated 

the 
role 
of 
throughout 

quarantine: 
technology. 
I 

would like to recognize that 

this is not a luxury enjoyed 

by all. This, however, made 

my realization even stronger: 

We need technology not only 

for ourselves but especially 

for individuals without the 

opportunities and resources 

we so often take for granted. 

Zoom, BlueJeans, Google 

Hangouts and more video 

platforms have become the 

new classrooms for countries 

across the globe. Without 

technology, this would not 

be possible. While there is 

undeniably a difference in 

learning through my computer 

screen in my pajamas, I still 

have the opportunity to learn 

from professors I’ve grown 

comfortable listening to over 

a semester’s worth of work. I 

am grateful for the chance to 

continue my education even 

if the circumstances are a bit 

unorthodox. I unexpectedly 

find myself longing for lecture 

halls yet remain grateful for 

the familiar vibrato of my 

professors’ voices through a 

time where nearly everything 

else is uncharted territory. Not 

only school but work, too, has 

been transitioned to remote 

operations — an unthinkable 

feat without solid WiFi and 

access to internet software. 

Despite being isolated to 

a house with only my mom, 

my dad and my dog, I have 

the ability to regularly talk 

to my sister in Nashville, 

Tennessee, and my brother 

in a house around the corner. 

Technology 
has 
presented 

us with the possibility to 

continue 
conversing 
with 

friends, family and colleagues. 

My four-year-old niece has 

learned to ask us to “Zoom 

her” and my family regularly 

conducts games over different 

video chat rooms. Moving out 

of a constantly occupied dorm 

building to a home occupied 

by three people has felt much 

livelier than anticipated. With 

everyone 
experiencing 
this 

pandemic 
simultaneously, 

it seems communication is 

actually more common now 

than before our lives were 

essentially 
paused 
until 

further 
notice. 
The 
sheer 

possibility of communicating 

with the outside world — 

family, friends and beyond 

— helps to keep potential 

loneliness and the inevitable 

stir-craziness at bay. 

The routine I had grown 

so 
comfortable 
replicating 

day after day may have been 

taken away from me. My trips 

to the University of Michigan 

Museum of Art cafe may now 

be trips down the stairs to my 

Keurig, but I am grateful to be 

able to adapt my perspective to 

the new circumstances around 

me. It is this adaptation that 

I encourage you to focus on. 

The space around us can 

be refocused to provide the 

different sectors of our lives 

a temporary substitute for 

the musty tables in Hatcher 

Graduate Library and a Friday 

night trip to Frita Batidos. 

While I yearn for my daily 

walks 
to 
CityRow, 
I 
am 

thankful for the unbelievable 

camaraderie 
demonstrated 

by 
fitness 
apps 
and 

instructors everywhere. Free 

memberships and Instagram/

Facebook Live have provided 

people the opportunity to 

continue to exercise, dance, 

sing and even act from the 

comfort (and safety) of their 

homes. 
In 
lieu 
of 
movie 

theater 
releases, 
movies 

have been streamed online 

and 
uploaded 
to 
different 

streaming 
networks. 
The 

world has adapted and molded 

to fit this new technological 

way of life. 

While all of these uses 

of 
technology 
and 
social 

media platforms are arguably 

incredible adaptations to a 

social-distancing 
lifestyle, 

it is the access to news and 

applications 
that 
augment 

safety measures that stand 

out 
amid 
the 
coronavirus 

pandemic. Being informed on 

the latest news is imperative 

to navigate this crisis in the 

safest 
and 
most 
effective 

way to “flatten the curve.” 

Additionally, 
apps 
like 

Instacart 
allow 
people 
to 

avoid grocery stores and thus 

avoid 
potentially 
infecting 

others or themselves. 

Though I encourage people 

to continue to go outside safely 

and avoid an overwhelming 

amount of screen time, it 

has been reassuring to find 

something positive amid a 

very negative time in history. 

Without technology, life truly 

would be paused for everyone, 

but instead, we have found a 

way to adapt to this new, much 

smaller world available to 

each of us, albeit much more 

virtually than ever before. In 

the absence of The Michigan 

Daily paper to hold, we have 

continued to write and publish 

to our virtual platform. With 

my regular morning coffee, 

my phone acts as a substitute 

for the paper I know I will 

someday hold again. For now, 

I’m happy to report that my 

phone will suffice.

SAM JUNE

COMMUNITY CULTURE NOTEBOOK

If you’ve been to Rick’s, you’ve probably 

seen Sam June dancing. A second-year 

master’s student in electrical engineering, 

June takes the stage for hours every 

weekend. Unusually, though, he usually 

dances 
alone 
and 

sober. While many 

people go to Rick’s 

for sloppy make-outs 

and cheap drinks, he 

goes to find solace in 

dancing solo. 

It 
all 
started 

on 
June’s 
twenty-

first 
birthday. 
He 

and 
three 
friends 

went to Rick’s, and 

even 
though 
he’d 

never really danced 

before, 
he 
found 

himself enjoying the 

experience. 

He 
decided 

he wanted to try 

dancing again, but 

his friends weren’t 

always up for it — so 

he went alone.

“I would get bored, so I would go to 

Slounge or Rick’s or Cantina, and for a long 

time I never really danced,” he said. “I just 

sat in the back corner and maybe listened to 

music and briefly said hi to (a) friend or two 

if I saw them. I didn’t feel really comfortable 

dancing by myself at that time.”

At home, he found himself dancing for 

fun. “My bedroom closet is like a giant 

sliding mirror,” he said. “I would dance by 

myself and see what it looked like. It helped 

me to determine if something looked stupid 

or if I was like, ‘Oh, that didn’t look half 

bad.’”

June kept going back to bars, but he hadn’t 

worked up the confidence to dance yet. “It 

went on for months 

where 
I 
wouldn’t 

really dance at all, 

and it would kind 

of suck because one 

of my favorite songs 

would come on and 

I’d feel like I couldn’t 

really dance to it,” he 

said. 

Finally, he decided 

to just go for it. 

“One day, months 

down the line, one 

of my favorite Taylor 

Swift 
songs 
came 

on,” he explained. “I 

said ‘No, I’m gonna 

get up and dance. 

I don’t even care if 

everyone makes fun 

of me, I’m gonna do it.’”

He positioned himself in the back of the 

dance floor behind two groups of friends 

and began to dance. “That was the night a 

gate first opened up for me,” he said. 

Rick’s can be sort of like a middle school 

dance — you see people you know, and you 

want them to see you, too. But for June, the 

people around him don’t really figure into 

it. 

“When I started dancing on stage, I never 

did it for the crowd,” he said. “In fact, at 

first, I got nervous of what other people were 

saying about me. A pair of friends would 

be standing off to the side and exchanging 

whispers while staring up at me. Some 

might point and laugh while taking a picture 

or Snapchat video. Initially, I thought most 

people were ridiculing and insulting me, but 

I didn’t let it bother me.”

This attitude helped June decide what 

was more important to him; his own joy or 

other people’s opinions. His joy won out.

“At a point, I realized that it didn’t matter 

if those two girls in the back of the room 

were making fun of me; it didn’t matter if 

that one person taking a video of me was 

adding a degrading caption; it didn’t matter 

if that friend group was laughing at how bad 

my dancing was,” he said. “None of those 

things mattered because I wasn’t on the 

stage to seek validation or be the center of 

attention.”

Instead, he decided to just enjoy himself.

“I was happy because I was dancing and 

having fun in a way that made sense to me. 

When I dance, I feel like I don’t have to 

hold back from being myself, and it’s a very 

empowering feeling,” June said. “Dancing 

never fails to make me happy, no matter 

what kind of negativity is weighing on me.”

Now that Rick’s is closed due to the 

pandemic, June is finding new ways to use 

dancing to express himself and connect 

with others.

“Once quarantine kicked in, I got the idea 

to make a TikTok to keep the dancing spirit 

alive, even though Rick’s is off-limits,” he 

said. “So now every few days I post a video 

of myself dancing to a song I like.”

BOOK REVIEW
‘Followers’ depicts our alarming dependence on technology

LILLY PEARCE
Daily Arts Writer

Stuck inside, days blending together, time 

practically slipping through our fingers, it 

is technology that we cling to during this 

unprecedented period. Our reality is grounded 

with technology. It allows us to remain 

connected to the outside world. And though 

it’s true technology has become one of the 

most invaluable tools right now, this increased 

dependency has made us overlook the dangers 

of technology, the dangers that are explored in 

Megan Angelo’s debut novel, “Followers.”

With an extremely relevant look into our 

learned reliance on technology, Angelo makes 

you rethink your online presence — so much 

so that I now feel particularly paranoid when 

I find myself checking my Instagram feed and 

updating my Twitter timeline more than I ever 

have before. 

Angelo tells the story in two timelines: one set 

in 2015 with ambitious blogger Orla, who is stuck 

working as an inglorious reporter for a gossip 

magazine, and the other set in 2051 with celebrity 

Marlow, whose entire life has been broadcasted 

24/7 for the rest of the world to watch. Angelo 

alternates between these storylines, dropping 

hints to what has caused this distinct evolution of 

technology and transformation of American life 

known as the “Spill.” 

Orla strives to do something more with her life. 

She dreams of writing the novel that drove her to 

move to New York in the first place, but instead 

finds herself devoting the majority of her time to 

writing frivolous magazine articles on uprising 

influencers. We see her frustration growing 

while she resides on the outskirts of celebrity 

life, until her roommate, Floss, invents a scheme 

that will place both of them in the limelight of 

fame. Floss is desperate to be known, and Orla is 

desperate to transform her life, so together, the 

two capitalize on Orla’s position writing for the 

blog, Lady-ish, to propel Floss to stardom.Tired 

of being nobodies, they convince the world that 

Floss is somebody. 

Marlow, on the other hand, has been a 

beloved celebrity since birth but is now growing 

suspicious of her fans’ adoration. Marlow lives 

by the stage cues of the Constellation Network 

that orchestrates the lives of all its contributors, 

deciding everything from the clothes they wear 

to the food they eat. Only one hour every day, from 

three to four a.m., is not 

broadcasted to Marlow’s 

12 million followers. But 

despite her large following, 

she wonders why she feels 

so alone. This curiosity 

is 
only 
encouraged 
by 

the questions that arise 

in 
Marlow’s 
path, 
the 

inexplicability 
that 

develops as she learns more 

about her own past and the 

past of American society 

that 
the 
Constellation 

Network has kept secret 

from her for so long. 

Having grown up in Constellation, California, 

all that Marlow knows is what the Constellation 

Network has told her. In her future state, she is 

aware of the Spill, but is unfamiliar with specific 

details. Any questions or conversations Marlow 

has about the Spill are quickly suppressed by the 

network, which only piques her interest more. 

She wants answers that she is not getting, so 

as she has done all her life on camera, Marlow 

decides to act. 

It was harrowing to witness the extent to 

which technology influences both dystopian 

societies, despite 2015 being very much grounded 

in present-day circumstances. That is what 

made the modern setting of the book so striking 

— the fact that the majority of the events that 

occur could actually happen; as Orla and Floss 

manipulate social media for their benefit, the 

feasibility of a modern dystopia revealed itself, 

and to be living in a time where we spend our 

days glued to our devices, I quickly became 

paranoid as I wondered about what opportunities 

this increased reliance on technology presented 

for ambitious manipulators, hackers and even 

just 
bored 
quarantined 

scrollers, all of whom have 

too much time on their 

hands. 

My 
paranoia 
eased 

when I read from Marlow’s 

perspective in 2051. This 

world didn’t feel as real 

(and at times, was difficult 

for me to visualize at 

all), given the futuristic 

additions of robots and 

disturbing devices everyone 

had implemented in their 

wrists. 
These 
devices 

connect to the host’s brain, reminding me of Siri, 

or Amazon’s Alexa, only in your head rather than 

your device. Marlow can think of any question 

and the device responds to her as if it were her 

own thought. The devices ruled out the need for 

technology like cell-phones and computers, given 

the perpetual availability of knowledge in one’s 

own mind. 

But though my paranoia had passed its peak, 

that is not to say I am not thoroughly creeped out. 

I am already disturbed to find advertisements of 

products on my social media timeline that I had 

previously mentioned in passing, nevertheless 

actually searched, so I could not imagine having 

an even more powerful device linked directly to 

my inner thoughts. 

Nevertheless, I found the alarming presence 

of technology to be one of the most interesting 

aspects of the book. But, as I was reading to 

discover more about the “Spill” that led to the 

eradication of modern technology and the 

imminent innovation of the devices in 2051, 

I found myself getting lost in the superfluous 

details Angelo includes about the regular lives 

of Orla and Marlow. Angelo neglects to really 

characterize either of their personalities and 

as a result, their personal stories never really 

captivated me. Maybe they were just boring.

There was incredible content for Angelo to run 

with, had she narrowed focus on the manipulation 

of technology by these characters, but instead, 

she focused on rather irrelevant details of the 

characters’ lives that slowed the progression of 

the novel. Orla was too caught up talking about 

her highschool crush, whose role was completely 

unimportant to the storyline by the time he was 

introduced; Floss was characterized to have an 

incredibly strange backstory we never got to hear; 

Marlow was written too placidly. Excitement 

seemed to run away from her. 

While the applicability of the problematic 

technological usage made the book relevant, the 

unfulfilled characterization and dull, redundant 

backstories made the book feel a lot longer than it 

actually was. If Angelo would have focused on the 

dystopian effects of technology and taken more of 

the “Black Mirror” route with the presence and 

infiltration of our devices, the book would have 

been far more gripping. The commentary on our 

reliance on our phones and computers is stirring, 

but the overall book was not as enthralling as it 

had promised to be.

This attitude helped 
June decide what was 
more important to him; 
his joy trumped other 

people’s opinions.


Wednesday, April 15, 2020 — 6A
Arts
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

In response to the coronavirus pandemic, “Grey’s 

Anatomy” halted production on their season, before 

eventually cutting it short by four episodes. While it 

wasn’t the ending that was planned, the Season 16 finale 

of “Grey’s” was a satisfying one. Time and time again, 

the longest running medical drama in the history of 

television has proved its ability to pivot when something 

unexpected happens. After all, the production shutdown 

wasn’t the first hurdle “Grey’s” had to overcome this 

season; earlier, adjustments had to be made after Justin 

Chambers’ abrupt exit. It still remains unclear if the four 

unproduced episodes will roll over to the next season, but 

this makeshift finale had enough action and drama to hold 

us all over until the start of Season 17 — which has been 

rumored to be the final season.

For not actually being the originally planned season 

finale, “Grey’s” sure had some finale staples: a callback to 

an old “Grey’s” moment, a doctor who might die, another 

doctor going into labor, a voicemail of someone having 

sex with someone who wasn’t their fiance that plays on 

speakerphone during a surgery. Okay, well maybe not 

that one, but there is something oddly satisfying about 

watching someone get betrayed and humiliated in a public 

setting. What happened to Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd, 

“Star Wars Rebels”) and Teddy Altman (Kim Raver, “24”) 

was true soap opera craziness, and I love to see it.

Right as Webber was about to get checked out of the 

hospital, our beloved Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo, “Catch 

Me If You Can”) realizes that whatever is happening to him 

is destroying both his mind and his body. Meredith and Dr. 

Bailey (Chandra Wilson, “General Hospital”) are about to 

do a biopsy on Webber when off-the-rails Andrew DeLuca 

(Giacomo Gianniotti, “Backpackers”) comes storming into 

the O.R. He’s figured out what’s wrong with Webber — 

cobalt poisoning from a hip replacement — but instead of 

using his words, he throws all the surgical instruments on 

the floor to get Bailey and Meredith to listen to him.

Excuse me, sir? This man should not be allowed 

anywhere near the hospital, let alone an operating room. 

He’s clearly not okay. Thankfully, at the end of the episode, 

as Meredith leaves the hospital, she finds DeLuca sitting 

on the floor crying; he wants to understand why he’s been 

going manic. After he went to jail to help Meredith at the 

end of last season, now at the end of this season it appears 

Meredith is going to repay the favor. Had the season 

continued, one would assume that we would’ve gotten 

more insight into DeLuca’s bipolar-like symptoms and 

how he copes with whatever diagnosis is coming his way.

While Amelia (Caterina Scorsone, “Private Practice”) 

is giving birth to her child with Link (Chris Carmack, 

“Nashville”), Bailey takes Link to do the surgery on 

Webber. Amelia forces Bailey to stay with her, even though 

Bailey recently had a miscarriage. But being the queen that 

she is, Bailey hops on the bed and sits behind her the same 

way that George O’Malley did for her back in the second 

season. Everything goes smoothly and now Amelia is a 

mother.

This episode works as a finale because enough of our 

questions about some season-long storylines have been 

answered while new ones have been posed. It remains 

unclear if the new season will continue these character 

arcs or if some sort of “reset” must happen. Regardless, 

we anticipate we will get answers as to what’s happening 

with DeLuca, the fate of Owen and Teddy’s relationship, 

some sort of resolution to the constant fighting between 

Webber and his wife Catherine (Debbie Allen, “Grace and 

Frankie”) and perhaps the answer to the scariest question 

of all to ponder: will next season be the final season? Only 

time will tell.

FILM NOTEBOOK
Film scenes from the Apocolypse, Part 3: ‘2012’

SABRIYA IMAMI

Daily Arts Writer

Movies are projections. Yes, literally, in the sense of 

filmstock and screens and projectors and bulbs. But movies 

can also be projections of ourselves — a momentary snapshot 

of the internal, the introspective, the metaphysical. And 

given the circumstances, we as the film beat are seeing 

less literal projections in movie theaters and doing more 

projecting ourselves. So what are we thinking about? 

Among them are whether “When Harry Met Sally” is 

actually good, our Letterboxd log histories and — of course 

— the apocalypse. This series will traverse the cinematic 

doomsday in its eclectic iterations. After all, why grapple 

with an uncomfortable reality when you can watch movies 

that hyperbolize it completely? 

— Anish Tamhaney, Daily Film Editor

“2012” isn’t an apocalypse movie, not really. Yes, the 

world is ending, which is technically all you need for an 

apocalypse, but at its heart, “2012” is a hopeful movie 

about family. 

I had never seen the film before, so when I began 

watching it, I prepared myself for two and a half hours of 

death and destruction. There was death and destruction; 

in fact, IMDb says that the body count in this movie is 

over 7 billion. But what I wasn’t expecting was that the 

movie revolves around some really good people doing 

their best in an atrocious situation, which isn’t exactly an 

unfamiliar concept right now. 

Jackson Curtis (John Cusack, “Grosse Pointe Blank”) 

is supposed to be taking his kids camping when he finds 

out the world is ending, the Earth’s core is melting 

and the crust is breaking apart through earthquakes 

that authorities claim are nothing to worry about. And 

when he finds this out, what does he do? Everything he 

can to protect his family, even his ex-wife and her new 

boyfriend. Though the draw of the movie is the apocalypse 

and scenes like Jackson and his family barely escaping a 

crumbling California in a tiny plane, the reason why the 

film is actually worthwhile is because you see that even 

in horrific, catastrophic times, there are people who are 

genuinely good. Whether it’s a father who puts his life on 

the line on numerous occasions for his family, a young 

scientist whose mission is to save not just billionaires 

but everyone, a struggling president who stays with 

his sinking ship (or country) until the last moment or a 

mother who begs strangers to save her children even if it 

means she will die, there are people who will do whatever 

they can in a truly awful time.

And yes, of course you see the opposite of that as well: 

people whose selfishness comes to light in catastrophe, 

but even they have hearts. You may want to hate Adrian 

Helmsley’s (Chiwetel Ejiofor, “Doctor Strange”) superior 

Carl Anheuser (Oliver Platt, “The Three Musketeers”) 

because he seems to only want to save the people who 

can pay their way into a new world or those who have 

been genetically selected, but you can’t help but feel bad 

for him when you see him saying goodbye to his ailing 

mother. Or Yuri Karpov (Zlatko Buric, “Pusher”), who 

stabbed people in the back multiple times, including his 

girlfriend Tamara (Beatrice Rosen, “The Dark Knight”) 

and even Jackson. But in the end, that arrogant Russian 

puts his kids before everyone else, even himself, which is 

admirable. 

“2012” may be written off as an apocalypse movie, but 

it’s actually a movie about people who are struggling to 

do their best and remain good amid tragedy. The reason 

this movie hit me so hard was because that’s exactly 

what’s happening right now. While the coronavirus may 

be showing some people’s truly selfish colors, it’s also 

revealing that there are some genuinely good people 

out there. Healthcare workers, grocery store employees, 

teachers, people making masks to send to hospitals, 

families who are staying away from their loved ones 

to protect them … we rely on these good people. It’s 

difficult, unbearably so at times, but these people do 

what they have to for the greater good. I think Jackson 

Curtis would be proud of them.

NBC
Time and time again, the 
longest running medical-
drama in the history of 
television has proven 
its ability to pivot when 
something unexpected 

happens.

Whether it’s a father who 
puts his life on the line on 
numerous occasions for his 
family or a young scientist 
whose mission is to save 

not just the billionaires but 
everyone, there are people 
who will do whatever they 
can in a truly awful time.

I

f there’s one good thing that comes 
out of this quarantine, it’ll be the 
little spinach plants my boyfriend 

Davis and I planted in a garden bed behind 
his childhood home. A few weeks ago, in a 
rare haze of productivity, we planned out 
a summer garden and ordered some seeds. 
The first to sow? Spinach. (Which, to my 
uneducated surprise, does produce seeds.) 
We planted them in some seed-starter 
pellets, shoved them under the couch to 
“simulate soil darkness conditions,” as 
Davis pragmatically put it, and waited 
for those suckers to pop. Lo and behold, 
they did, and yesterday, with more focus 
and precision than I’ve given to any of 
my classes during the past two weeks, I 
helped him transplant them into the soil 
outside.

During the past 24 hours, both of 

us have gone out to check on them. 
He’ll gingerly hold the watering can 
over the buds or I’ll brush some dirt 
away from their emerging little leaves, 
which resemble actual spinach more and 
more each day. This morning I asked him how they did 
overnight. He replied with a detailed report of their 
nascent well-being. I imagine it’s how having children 
feels, especially if children came with far lower stakes, 
grew to adulthood on their own and then you ate them.

If their growth goes well and all our plants yield, we’ll 

have — by my comprehensive calculations — about 22 
leaves of spinach to eat when all is said and done. Even 
though it’s not quite enough for a salad, I look forward to 
gently pulling the leaves off, rinsing them above the sink, 
and creating something with them. I feel grateful to be 
able to grow and eat some of my own food, even if it’s just 
a few leaves of spinach.

I have felt connected to where my food grows before 

this, though — all of us at the University of Michigan have, 
whether we realize it or not. Not far from the University’s 
central campus is the Campus Farm. Nestled behind the 
Matthei Botanical Gardens and Nichols Arboretum, in 
what often feels worlds away from the urban Ann Arbor 
we’re used to, is organic, local produce growing in four 
hoop houses, two greenhouses and three acres of arable 
land.

The first time I volunteered at the Campus Farm was 

a freezing, rainy day in late October 2017 — we were 
outside harvesting swiss chard to be sent to the dining 
halls. I remember not being able to feel my fingers from 
the cold, but not caring because I was just beginning to 
realize that the swiss chard in my freezing, muddy hands 
was the same one I’d eat in East Quad once I got back 
home. 

I started volunteering almost every week and 

throughout the past three years I’ve been able to help 
harvest the spinach that was later in my spinach pie in 
East Quad, the microgreens that were on my bowl of 
stew at Maizie’s Kitchen in the League, the tomatoes in 
the salad bar at South Quad and the squash I took home 
and cooked for a Thanksgiving meal with my roommates 
once I finally moved out of the dorms.

Initially founded by a group of graduate and 

undergraduate students in 2012, the Campus Farm 
has grown to employ more than 27 student staff; it 
supports programming, volunteer and research oppor-
tunities, internships and classes; it is entirely student-
managed and makes over $100,000 in revenue and sells 
nearly 35,000 pounds of produce each year to clients 
like M-Dining and Argus Farm Stop. It also supports 
the Maize & Blue Cupboard, a food pantry that aims 
to ensure “healthy, nutritious, and nourishing food” to 
those who may face food insecurity, with regular produce 
donations.

Even with the coronavirus quarantine, the Maize 

& Blue Cupboard and the Campus Farm remain in 
operation. For the Campus Farm at least, there have been 
some obvious but necessary changes: The dining halls 
have temporarily suspended all orders from the Campus 
Farm and nearly all Campus Farm staff are now working 
remotely, doing administrative tasks and program and 
development planning individually and through Zoom 
meetings. Student and community volunteer workdays 
have also ended until the stay-at-home order ends and 

the quarantine is lifted. 

Lead Manager Carly Sharp, a recent alum, 

and Student Engagement Manager Lydia 
Hsu, a senior in the School of Kinesiology, 
have over six years of experience working 
at the farm between the two of them. I’ve 
gotten to know both of them over the past 
few years through hours of pulling up drip 
tape and afternoons of harvesting dozens 
of pounds of spinach. Both Sharp and Hsu 
are still able to work at the farm during the 
quarantine.

One thing they’ve been prepping for is 

the annual plant sale in collaboration with 
Matthaei Botanical Gardens and Nichols 
Arboretum. Each May, the farm sells 
transplants of popular garden plants like 
tomatoes and peppers. In an interview with 
The Daily, Sharp and Hsu said that because 
of the stay-at-home order in Michigan, 
“There will literally be thousands and 
thousands of plants that could go to people 
and won’t (if the sale can’t happen).”

If the stay-at-home order continues 

through the summer, the Campus Farm 

won’t be able to plant their normal amount, which means 
less produce to harvest in the fall and fewer sales made 
to M-Dining. “Because (M-Dining) is where a lot of our 
revenue comes from in the fall, it could mean fewer staff 
and less programming that we’d be able to support in the 
long run.” 

But plants are plants, and they keep doing their thing 

during quarantine. There is still spinach that needs to be 
harvested and chard that needs to be planted. Hsu said 
that because it’s been so warm, she plants something in 
a greenhouse one day, it will pop out of the soil the next.

Even though it may be a little stunted right now, the 

farm is certainly not going away. “I feel super fortunate 
and am super proud to be part of an organization that’s 
still supporting staff and students right now, and that we 
have the means to be able to do that as an organization,” 
Sharp said.

The best part of the Campus Farm? “It allows so much 

collaboration, and community, and autonomy,” Hsu said. 
“Whatever ideas we have, we have the space to go forth 
with them.”

I know for certain that without my experiences at 

the Campus Farm, my 22 leaves of spinach would not be 
growing in the backyard right now. This summer Davis 
and I plan to grow some jalapenos, cayenne peppers, 
banana peppers and cucumbers. The place where they’ll 
grow is just a small homemade garden bed built from 
some scrap wood with a few screws sticking out, but it 
does the trick. Virus or no virus, we’re all still learning 
how to grow.

O

ver the past two weeks, my 
campus house has had 200 
multivitamins, 48 beers, 10 

bottles of wine, seven pints of ice cream, 
four bags of chips, two Monster energy 
drinks and one gallon of spring water 
delivered to our doorstep.

It’s a grocery haul far too depraved 

for Instacart or Shipt. We’ve been 
abusing 
goPuff, 
the 
millennial-

catering-convenience-delivery-gig-
business, with a regularity it was never 
designed for. Founded in 2013 by Drexel 
juniors Yakir Gola and Rafael Ilishayev, 
goPuff started as an on-demand hookah 
delivery service, hence its endearing 
moniker. Around a year later, however, 
these 
two 
poster-child 
disruptors 

noted that the demands for chips and 
paper towels were outpacing those 
for blunt wraps and shisha, and they 
responded to observed user needs by 
keenly rebranding as your friendly 
neighborhood mobile convenience store 
— a founding myth that will leave an 
enterprising tech bro absolutely weak in 
the knees.

In six years, goPuff has expanded 

to 150 United States locations with an 
emphasis on urban hubs and college 
towns, including our own lady Ann 
Arbor last May. I first heard of it last 

week, though, when I reached the end 
of my pre-quarantine booze haul and 
began openly complaining about the 
dearth of wine. A housemate mentioned 
goPuff in conciliatory passing and I 
looked it up because it sounded funny 
(marketing warlocks). Twenty minutes 
later I was the proud owner of two 
cheap pinots and a dum-dum taped to a 
“happy first order” card. Magic. 

Within days my whole house was 

obsessed. We were at the rice-every-
night end of our pantry stock and 
trying to avoid grocery stores as long as 
possible. The idea that Ben & Jerry’s or 
a full 30-rack of Natty Light could be at 
the door in half an hour, bing bang boom, 
was manna from heaven. The flat $1.95 
delivery fee (often negated with promo 
codes like “DOUBLEUP,” wink wink) 
coupled with the fact that you don’t 
have to compete for a slot colored it in 
a particularly miraculous pandemic-era 
light.

What I’m saying is that every 36 

hours, as if by subconscious instinct, 
my 
house 
found 
itself 
huddling 

around someone’s laptop to compose a 
melodious, collaborative goPuff order. 
We began affectionately referring to the 
service as “Puff Daddy” and clogged one 
another’s Venmo feeds with half-wit 

variations of the endearment. 
We killed time by surfing the 
site’s unusually comprehensive 
inventory, searching for some 
rhyme or reason to its generous 
definition 
of 
“convenience 

good.” Where else can you buy 
chewing tobacco, Hot Pockets, 
shampoo, single cans of Four 
Loko and $70 Fleshlights in 
one extremely foul swoop? 
Puff Daddy will satisfy you, 
and you, and you and you, too! 
(You get a Fleshlight! You get a 
Fleshlight!)

When 
I 
explained 
this 

phenomenon to a neighbor 
during 
a 
socially-distanced 

porch hang they bark-laughed 
at me and replied, “Good to 
see neoliberalism is still doing 
well!” which was very effective 
in slowing my roll about it all 
because they’re totally right 
(though I know for a fact 
my neighbors made Easter 
mimosas on Sunday morning 
with champagne they ordered 
from none other than Puff 

Daddy — so suck it, 412.)

The skinny is that like every other 

gig company out there, goPuff is a 
multimillion-dollar 
brainchild 
that 

squeezes 
its 
own 
1099-contracted 

workers 
for 
most 
all 
operational 

resources — vehicles, gas, maintenance, 
phones, insurance — while paying 
them 
the 
minimum 
and 
leaving 

them 
to 
independently 
scramble 

for hours. On top of that, goPuff is 
backed by a dripping panel of venture 
capitalists including the notorious tech 
conglomerate SoftBank, aka the literal 
daddy of the military-minded robotics 
company Boston Dynamics, aka the 
people loaning robotic dogs to the 
Massachusetts State Police. Even my 
precious Puff Daddy can be traced back 
to some of the evilest capitalists out 
there. It begs the question, is anything 
truly free? These are thoughts that 
would make you run for the hills if there 
weren’t a pandemic. 

While rideshare services — the 

veritable emblem of the neoliberal 
business model — have tanked in the 
wake 
of 
COVID-19, 
food 
delivery 

gig-services 
are 
experiencing 

an unprecedented rise in demand, 
goPuff among them. In a recent email 

to The Daily, Liz Romaine, goPuff 
director of communications, reported 
“an increase in customer demand,” 
especially for “household essentials, 
OTC medications, meat, bread, pasta, 
canned items and water as well as baby 
products.”

Forget the impressive array of dip 

varietals and sex toys. With the arguable 
exception of certain college houses that 
may or may not prioritize alcohol over 
nutrition, most users are out there doing 
what they can to get what they need in 
the safest way possible, which includes 
leveraging an indulgent gig-grocery 
service for the bare staples. 

Romaine did emphasize that goPuff’s 

“number one priority is keeping our 
driver-partners, employees, customers 
and community safe and healthy,” 
and that goPuff has implemented new 
policies and procedures to do so amid 
COVID-19. 

For the record, all the driver-partners 

I’ve interacted with over the last two 
weeks have worn copious personal 
protective equipment and performed 
no-contact delivery, including scanning 
IDs from a distance when required. 
Residents in Philadelphia, however, 
have had issues with medical gloves and 
personal protective equipment — all 
in the brand’s signature bright blue — 
discarded in public areas outside one of 
goPuff’s warehouses.

Romaine concluded her email with an 

announcement of a 90-day hiring push 
to meet increased demand, complete 
with links to applications.

Like most everything coronavirus-

related — which, nowadays, is almost 
everything — it’s hard to tell whether 
these changes constitute a temporary, 
passing phase or something seriously 
bound 
to 
internalize 
into 
more 

permanent industry patterns. Maybe 
goPuff/SoftBank/gig-groceries 
will ride this wave into oppressive 
Amazon-level omnipotence and I’ll 
kick myself for being forever complicit 
via that first bottle of Apothic Red. Or 
maybe I’ll be back at the Main Street 
Party Store next month (very dubious, 
but worthy of hypothetical address) 
and goPuff will be something forever 
and always associated with This Thing 
Alone, sayonara, book closed. I don’t 
know.

The one thing I’m sure of, though, is 

how to get a Fleshlight in a pandemic.

Stressed? goPuff will bring you
 sex toys, canned soup

T

he muezzin’s call rang out over 
the masjid speakers, reciting the 
Islamic kalima, or statement of 

faith, and my mother grabbed my hand as 
we separated from my father and brother 
to answer the call to prayer. It was one of 
the occasional times my family went to 
our mosque in Miami, but at age eight, I 
was already aware that we were walking 
to the women’s section behind the men’s, 
separated by a row of dividers across 
the middle of a large prayer room. The 
unpatterned wall of beige dividers towered 
over me when I was a child, but as time 
went on, they never really felt smaller. 
They blocked our view of the imam, or 
religious leader, and we prayed, listening to 
his disembodied voice recite excerpts from 
the Quran. 

After years of the same routine, I 

remember one day finally asking my mother 
why we had to pray separate from the men. 
Her answer, somewhat vague, combined 
the notion of prioritizing spiritualism, that 
the separation allowed mosque-goers to 
focus on God alone and because of tradition 
— this was what had always been done. I 
was temporarily comforted by her answer, 
but I couldn’t help but wonder why it was 
the women who were delegated behind the 
barriers. 

I wasn’t the first person to ask these 

questions, nor will I be the last. Members 
of the reformist Muslim community have 
combatted questions like these for years, 
with some groups staging protests against 
gendered practices. In 2003, activist and 
journalist Asra Q. Nomani challenged her 
mosque in Morgantown, West Virginia by 
praying in the men’s section rather than the 
secluded women’s section on the balcony. 
She argued, “The prophet Muhammad 
didn’t put women behind partitions, and 
the barriers were just emblematic of sexist 
man-made rules.” Her actions resulted 
in a trial organized by the mosque. Years 
later, a group of women, led by Fatimah 
Thompson, in Washington, D.C., staged a 
similar act of civil disobedience and were 
consequently escorted out by police force.

Nomani spoke on NPR’s series “Faith 

Matters” to expand on the importance of 
breaking gender segregation, “... the mosque 
is not just a prayer space, it is a community 
hall. It is a place where public policy in 
the community is established. And what 
happens when you sequester women into 
these corners, is we dont vote at elections. 

We don’t participate in policy development. 
And so, you allow these places to become 
safe houses for ideology that may not be 
peaceful always.” She proposes that while 
she wishes to abolish gender segregation in 
mosques, she still respects women who feel 
safer praying in their respective sections 
and believes women should have the option 
to pray where they please.

Their movement is one of many across 

America — and the larger world — that 
reflect a shift in the way we approach 
spirituality in an increasingly secularized 
world. Traditionally, we have viewed 
organized religion and religious traditions 
as an applied, systematic reflection of one’s 
spirituality, but religion and spirituality 
are not always the same. 

In a 2017 poll, the Pew Research Center 

reported that 27 percent of U.S. adults 
identify as spiritual but not religious. This 
number reflects a steady increase, which 
is estimated to increase by 8 percentage 
points in the five years after the study. 
Other studies report Americans who 
identify 
their 
religious 
affiliation 
as 

“nothing in particular” have grown by 5 
percent. Indeed, people are leaving their 
sects, but are they in search of something 
else? 

My 
personal 
sense 
of 
spirituality 

centers around the belief that I am only 
a small piece of a larger, unexplainable 
world. Rather than letting this scare me, 
spirituality tells me that in my existence 
there is balance, and within the madness 
there is meaning. Growing up, I sincerely 
appreciated the role religion played in my 
life. I recall reciting prayers before I slipped 
my mask on at fencing tournaments, before 
taking exams or before just about any 
challenge I prepared myself to face. I didn’t 
pray to mystically improve my skills, but 
rather to acknowledge aspects of life that 
were beyond my own control. Praying was 
putting out the energy to “the forces that 
be” — asking for a just outcome. 

My need for change regarding my 

spirituality arose not because of the way 
it was applied in my life. What troubled 
me was when forms of spirituality, 
which I have always held as a source of 
empowerment, seemed to disempower my 
existence. As I grew older, I remember 
continuing to ask my mother about why our 
experiences at the mosque felt so distant 
and different from those of my father 
and brother. Despite her honest efforts, I 

no longer felt satisfied by the religious 
explanations for differences within our 
practices of the same faith. I found myself 
confused with what to do with the faith I 
still felt but had no way of directing. I felt 
I could never embrace a belief system that 
didn’t value me — and all people — 
in the same way. 

Other 
modern 
worshippers 

within organized religion have 
often grappled with this sense 
of disempowerment within their 
communities, particularly those 
with marginalized identities, like 
women or members of the LGBTQ+ 
community. 
Oppressive 
beliefs 

within religious communities can 
even extend beyond marginalized 
groups in their impact and can 
inhibit the altruistic objectives 
that many religious groups strive to 
fulfill. In late March, a temporary 
New York City hospital intended 
to 
treat 
COVID-19 
patients, 

funded by Christian evangelist 
group Samaritan’s Purse, required 
volunteers to agree to a “statement 
of faith” that says “marriage is 
exclusively the union of one genetic 
male and one genetic female” 
before allowing them to volunteer. 

As population statistics have 

reflected, modern ideas of faith have 
been changing, and members of 
established organized religions are 
left with the question of whether or 
not to adapt. The Muslim reformists 
protesting 
gender 
segregation 

demonstrate one of many ways 
policy changes are being made 
within religious communities to 
reflect a commitment to equity 
and inclusion. Similarly, recent 
years have seen the growth of 
Christian 
LGBTQ+ 
support 

groups, such as The Naming 
Project, which aims to “provide 
a safe and sacred space where 
youth of all sexual orientations 
and gender identities are named 
and claimed by a loving God” 
through camps and programming for 
LGBTQ+ youth. According to Catholic 
news publication Crux, Pope Francis has 
said that homosexual tendencies are “not a 
sin” and has famously answered, “Who am 
I to judge?” when asked about his stance on 
homosexuality.

Here 
in 
Ann 
Arbor, 
the 
First 

Congregational Church of Ann Arbor 
has emphasized their commitment to 
inclusivity through a church resolution 
stating that church members must “speak 
out against hate-speech, physical attacks, 
and threats aimed at individuals or groups. 
(They) work to make (their) communities 
free of hatred and intimidation.” These 
efforts aim to make faith more inclusive, 

equitable and accessible to a broader range 
of people across socioeconomic, racial and 
gender identities, among others. 

Still, as statistics show an increase of 

those who consider themselves spiritual 
but not religious, new spiritual outlets 
outside 
of 
organized 
religions 
have 

increased in popularity. Pop culture has 
reflected a growing awareness of avenues 
of spirituality that fall beyond popular 
religions. Weekly astrological horoscopes 
in magazines, like those in Cosmopolitan 
and The Huffington Post, have become 
widely popularized. Film and television, 
driven by magical realism and themes 
of environmentalism and spiritualism, 
such as “My Neighbor Totoro,” have been 

critically acclaimed and widely viewed, 
grossing over $30 million at the box office. 
A core theme of James Cameron’s “Avatar,” 
the second highest grossing film of all time, 
is environmental spiritualism. 

Even social conceptions of organized 

religion have broken into the public 

consciousness 
through 
award-

winning films such 
as 
“The 
Master” 

starring 
Joaquin 

Phoenix 
and 
the 

late Phillip Seymour 
Hoffman, 
which 

portrays Scientology 
and grants the public 
insight into religious 
ideologies 
that 

weren’t 
previously 

widely known. 

Why people leave 

their 
religious 

groups or seek out different expressions of 
spirituality is a question with multitudes of 
answers based on experience and context. 
To understand a bit more about how 
young people are dealing with the tension 
between spirituality and religion, I spoke 
to a few college students on their own 
journeys to a new spirituality.

In a phone interview with The Daily, 

Sydney Merydith, an incoming 
college freshman at The New 
School 
in 
New 
York 
City, 

described her relationship with 
astrology as “providing a greater 
sense of understanding whatever 
life presents,” and that while she 
uses astrology to define herself, 
she wouldn’t describe the practice 
as a religion. In fact, she turned 
to astrology after feeling what 
she describes as “the danger 
of the rigidity that comes with 
organized religion.”

Merydith’s 
concerns 
about 

rigidity are echoed by researchers 
studying the driving forces behind 
the religiously unaffiliated. In 
journalist Kevin Shrum’s analysis 
of James E. White’s book “Facts 
and Trends, Rise of the Nones: 
Understanding 
and 
Reaching 

the 
Religiously 
Unaffiliated,” 

he remarks that one of White’s 
key explanations for movement 
away from the Christian church 
is that “the church is too narrow-
minded and unbending on moral 
issues” and “antiquated in its 
methodologies.” Essentially, some 
have felt that the restrictions of 
organized religion do not fully 
encapsulate 
what 
spirituality 

means for them and that its 
methodologies are alienating. 

Raised Catholic, Merydith said, 

“My experience with organized 
religion made me scared and 
angry at the idea of any religion — 
but as I discovered more aspects 
to spirituality, I realized that 
believing that was in itself a rigid 
way of thinking. Astrology helped 
me open up to finding my own 
spiritual path.”

Indeed, astrology has acted as a 

mechanism for many to expand their 
conceptions of spiritualism. Pew Research 
Center data shows that 29 percent of 
Americans believe in astrology and its 
growing cultural acceptance has been 
unseen since the 1970s. The data also 

reflects that many couple their belief in 
organized religion with a belief in other 
spiritual conceptions, labeled “New Age” 
by the Pew Research Center, like astrology. 

In The New Yorker, journalist Christine 

Smallwood 
describes 
the 
growing 

population of those who believe in 
astrology as remarkable. “It’s not just that 
you hear (about astrology). It’s who’s saying 
it: people who aren’t kooks or climate-
change deniers, who see no contradiction 
between using astrology and believing 
in science. The change is fuelling (sic) a 
new generation of practitioners.” This 
reveals another aspect of some modern 
spiritualists; they question the balance 
between faith and science.

Shrum’s summary of White’s book “The 

Rise of the Nones: Understanding and 
Reaching the Religiously Unaffiliated” 
addresses this notion by explaining that 
another reason we can see a population 
shift 
away 
from 
organized 
religion, 

particularly Christianity, is because of its 
lack of evidence or scientific explanation 
regarding key tenets of the religion, such 
as the creation myth. This struggle is 
heightened within an increasingly secular 
world. 

Gehenna Garcia, a sophomore at the 

University of Michigan, described growing 
up in a Christian household in which she 
was told reading religious magazines, such 
as “The Origin of Life - Five Questions 
Worth Asking,” would answer her broader 
questions regarding faith’s relationship to 
science. 

“It explained that the chance of the Big 

Bang and evolution was minuscule, but they 
never gave evidence regarding their God. It 
was extremely hard for me to believe in one 
omnipotent God.” 

Even 
after 
moving 
away 
from 

Christianity, 
she 
maintained 
her 

spirituality, “While in the religion, my 
beliefs were that spirituality was the belief 
in God, praising his name, and spreading 
his word throughout the world. After 
moving away from conventional religion, 
I began to realize that spirituality was our 
connection to ourselves and this world.”

After identifying as agnostic, Garcia 

recently discovered Wicca, which she 
described as “the belief that we should 
worship the Earth and give back what it 
gave us,” from her roommate who was 
taking a history class on witchcraft. She 
now identifies as a pagan and also believes 
in astrology. 

Garcia discovered paganism, a religion 

not related to the three major world religions 
— Islam, Judaism and Christianity — and 
that invovles nature worship, after she 
had already begun to practice witchcraft, 
and found it easy to merge the two belief 
systems. Describing the process, she said, 
“I still felt as if I was missing something. I 
had always had issues believing in one god, 
but with paganism, there are pantheons 
of gods and goddesses … after discovering 
paganism and doing extensive research, it 
was easy to change my path in witchcraft 
to please the gods and goddesses that I 
prefer to give offerings to and work with.” 

Her synthesis of belief systems reflects 

an increasing personalization of faith and 
spirituality. As some choose to believe 

in a structured faith system as well as 
astrology, or a combination of a number 
of 
spiritual-based 
ideologies, 
modern 

spirituality can be a customized process, 
self-determination based on the factors one 
aligns with. 

Merydith navigates astrology with her 

friends with the same sense of fluidity. 
“We like to read as much as the stars have 
to tell us, and decide for ourselves if it’s 
something we believe, something that 
could guide our actions or something that 
just isn’t really useful or applicable.” 

Yet for those who choose to explore 

“new age” outlets for spirituality, how have 
they connected to each other without the 
traditional meeting places we expect from 
organized religions?

Some, like Garcia, have turned to the 

internet. For every subgroup, there are 
pages on Facebook, Reddit, Tumblr and 
other social media websites connecting 
believers across cities and continents. 
Garcia discovered astrology through the 
blogging website Tumblr and discovered 
other spiritualists like her through the app 
TikTok. 

“TikTok has actually connected me with 

other people who have the same beliefs as 
me … the people who have been in my faith 
for a long time help those of us who are 
fairly new. It was and still is, really difficult 
to find people who have the same ideology 
as me in real life. Many people are scared 
or turned away from my beliefs,” she said.

Shared spirituality also allows one to feel 

connected to a greater purpose or meaning. 
Across traditional organized religions, 
reformed religions, “new age” spiritualism, 
niche spiritual sects or a combination 
thereof, there’s a common part of us that 
gains comfort in being an accepted part of 
something bigger than ourselves. 

In this time of year where Instagram feeds 

are flooded with pictures of celebrations of 
Passover, Easter and Ramadan, it’s obvious 
that traditions of togetherness, family and 
reflection are still important vehicles that 
drive spirituality and religious practice. 
Maybe before focusing on where religion is 
headed, we must consider what it has been 
for us thus far: Something that brings us 
together.

As my family gears up for Ramadan, I am 

once again faced with the question of what 
exactly I believe. Spirituality has been a 
journey for me, and I still find it hard to 
fully place myself at a single destination. 
However, while this uncertainty used to 
give me anxiety, writing this piece has 
been truly therapeutic. Realizing that new 
methods of spirituality are growing in 
popularity and acceptance, that millions of 
other Americans don’t quite have their own 
spirituality narrowed down and that there 
are people out there I can connect with 
when I do feel like connecting, has given 
me the reassurance I’ve been searching 
for. Spirituality is not all or nothing, it just 
simply is. I do not have to be the perfect 
Muslim. I do not have to be anything at all. 
I simply believe — and that’s enough.

‘New Spirituality’: outlets for 
spiritualism in a now secular world

W

here 
are 
you 

from?” 
is 
a 
hard 

question for me to answer. 

“Do you mean, where do 

I live right now?” is usually my most common rebuttal. 
I don’t mean to be difficult, I just want to provide an 
honest response. For me, it’s tricky to stick to a consistent 
story, and I try not to get too bogged down in the details. 
Before I turned 18, I had already lived in 12 different 
houses and attended eight different grade schools. 

I am jealous of my friends who can so easily whip out 

a response to the same question. “I’m from X city in X 
Midwestern state. I’ve lived in the same house my whole 
life.” The most straight-forward answer I can provide 
is that I’m from Charleston, S.C., which is where my 
family and I have resided since 2012. But the reality is 
I’ve lived all over the Southeastern coastline. 

I was born in Orlando, Fla., and lived there for 

probably a grand total of three months before my family 
moved to South Carolina for the first time. From there, 
we circulated Virginia for a decade, moving towns 
about every four years, first living around the Norfolk 
and Virginia Beach areas in the Chesapeake Bay before 
then heading upstate to Charlottesville in the Blue 
Ridge Mountains before eventually relocating back to 
Charleston, S.C., when I was 13. 

When I returned, it had been a decade since I last 

lived there. My mom pointed out to me that many of my 
classmates were kids that I had also been in preschool 
with, only I had no recollection of them. It made me 
wonder how many potentially fruitful and long-lasting 
relationships might have been thrown away due to my 
family’s constant relocation. I was furious. What was 
the point of moving so much if we just kept coming 
back to the same places? My parents eventually started 
calling me a “real estate brat” to our new neighbors at 
housewarming parties, as an obvious play on the term 
“military brat.”

Two years later, in 10th grade, I ended up heading 

back up to Virginia to attend boarding school. The school 
itself was all-boys, all-boarding and had a military dress 
code. I rarely left campus on the weekends, and the 
consistency of attending boarding school gave me a little 
bit of geographic security, even if it made my backstory 
even harder to trace. As I would walk to class along the 
brick walkways of the lush, Jeffersonian-style campus, 

I 
would 

ponder: Am 

I from Virginia 

or 
South 
Carolina? 

Neither 
answer felt right with my 

identity, 
and I couldn’t decipher which 

felt more like home, let alone answer it in an icebreaker 
or to a new acquaintance.

The reason for all this moving around was my father’s 

occupation as a real estate developer. In the business of 
neighborhood development, there’s always a new project. 
For my dad, that meant acting as a land management 
consultant for a Virginia winery or designing the street 
layout of a new community in suburban Charleston. The 
liquid nature of his job meant that every couple of years 
my family would have to haul our belongings to my dad’s 
new workplace — a new city, a new house, a new school. 

My dad grew up as a military brat to my grandfather, 

who was a fighter jet pilot in the Navy. Having moved 
from Texas to California to Italy, my father had lived 
across tens of thousands of miles across the nation and 
globe by the age of six. I often wonder what imprint 
this left on him as he transitioned to his adult life. Was 
a consistent nature of moving something that never 
bothered him? Or did my father learn to view moving 
around as being financially pragmatic? I wonder if 
his seemingly casual stance toward moving ended up 
having a bleeding effect on me.

I remember playing SimCity on CD-ROM and 

oftentimes having my dad inspect my computer model 
town complete with art museums and universities. I had 
him double-check for infrastructural errors with traffic 
patterns or commercial zoning. Afterward, I would 
destroy everything I’d built with a click of a button, 
whether it be a nuclear weapon, a tornado or a robotic 
Godzilla. Little did I know it, but I was quickly learning 
to let my deep-seated feelings and attachments go. 

Anything I could create or become invested in could 

disappear. My Tee Ball League, Cub Scouts, teachers 
and friends from school could all vanish in an instant. 
I was slowly becoming an incredibly hard-bitten child. 
I had developed no concept of geographic permanence 
as I internalized the hit-or-miss tendencies of the 
real estate industry. This habit only grew when my 
family’s financial security collapsed along with the 
entire housing market during the 2008 recession. The 
financial meltdown also left my mother, a freelance 
architect, out of a job. I knew we’d soon have to move 

homes to supplement our losses, but I wasn’t so shaken 
since I was no stranger to dropping my obligations on a 
dime’s notice. 

Even years before the market crashed, when I was 

eight or nine, I was playing with my toys when I 
realized I lost a Playmobil figure somewhere in my 
bedroom. Instead of crying and complaining to my 
mom, I remember thinking “It’s fine. It’s somewhere 
in here. I’ll find it when we move again and all the 
furniture is packed.” I can’t even remember in which 
house this occurred, but I can remember that feeling 
of knowing we were going to need to move again, 
eventually. 

I even acquired a sleep tactic that I still use fairly 

often, passed on to me from my father. It’s a popular old 
wives’ tale that if you’re having trouble going to sleep, 
you should resort to counting sheep in your head in order 
to drift off. I learned to do things a little differently: 
Instead of mindless counting, I try to remember every 
wall of every room I’ve ever lived in. I’m pretty certain 
this little trick works because I usually doze off before I 
can reach the room where I currently sleep. 

I start by trying to remember the placement of the 

windows, the closets and if there was a bathroom 
attached. I try to remember desks and picture frames 
and where my toy chest or lacrosse stick might have 
been placed. Where were the Dell computer console and 
the chalk easel? What clothes might have been left on 
the ground or tucked into my dressers? Before I can get 
into the detailed specifics, I’m fast asleep. 

But moving to 12 different houses was in no way all 

for naught. Over the years I naturally learned how to be 
charismatic by repeatedly being dropped into new social 
settings. I survived new classrooms and sports teams by 
learning to be funny. I also learned to be quiet when it 
was strategically necessary for me to make a good first 
impression. 

My time in Ann Arbor has been the best of my life 

so far, but I know I won’t stay here much longer. I’ve 
told many of my friends and family that the first place 
I move after graduation — though I’m not sure where, 
yet — will be my home for the next 20 years. I’m hoping 
New York so I can be there when the Knicks eventually 
turn things around and win a championship. I know 
long-term residency will be difficult to accomplish along 
with the looming uncertainty of our national economy 
and the volatility of the job market for young people, 
but I’m going to try my hardest to stick to one place for 
continuity’s sake. 

I know I have lived in enough childhood bedrooms 

to keep me counting them in my sleep for an eternity. 
However, I think there’s some emotional strength I 
could develop from staying in one place. In the past, 
I’ve always looked forward to new beginnings as a way 
to reset my personality and start over. Instead, I need 
to learn how to ride the emotional ebbs and flows that 
come with living in one location for a long time and 
seeing I’ve been able to grow over time. Being able to 
say you are from somewhere speaks volumes to your 
identity and comfort as an individual. In the future, I 
hope I can answer “where are you from?” a little more 
simply.

Confessions from a real-estate brat

BY MAXWELL BARNES, STATEMENT CONTRIBUTOR

 CHRISTINE JEGARL


O

n March 11, I sat in my small, 
dimly-lit apartment watching 
ESPN as footage came in of 

health officials sprinting out onto the 
court of Chesapeake Energy Arena 
in Oklahoma City, setting off a delay. 
Minutes earlier there was no official 
explanation for the delay to the start of 
Jazz vs. Thunder, but now there was — 
Jazz center Rudy Gobert tested positive 
for coronavirus. 

Sports 
actualized 
the 
threat 
of 

COVID-19 to the American public. After 
the chaos in Oklahoma City, numerous 
leagues across the globe, like the Big 
Ten and the Premier League, made 
plans to move forward and hold games 
without fans. One scene made me realize 
that sports would not be able to go on: 
the image of Nebraska men’s basketball 
coach Fred Hoiberg. In an early round 
of Big Ten Tournament play, Hoiberg sat 
on the sidelines, visibly ill. Sweat poured 
from his forehead as he was doubled 
over on the bench, clearly not feeling 
well. The assistant to his left put on hand 
sanitizer. Twitter was ablaze with fans 
questioning why Hoiberg was on the 
court, seemingly putting his team and 
others in danger. While he eventually 
did not test positive for COVID-19, the 
scene of him interacting with players and 
referees while visibly ill left a collective 
thought: What the hell is he doing out 
there? What the hell are we doing, letting 
him be out there?

As a fan of European soccer, I saw 

the sporting world’s first response to 
COVID-19 a week earlier. Serie A, the 
Italian soccer league, initially moved to 
play “behind closed doors” — no fans, 
just teams and media. League leaders 
Juventus met challengers Inter Milan 
at an empty Allianz Stadium. The eerie 
shouts of jubilation rang out from the 
Juventus bench as Argentinian forward 
Pablo Dybala scored a second goal to seal 
the win for the Old Lady. 

Days later in England, the same day 

as the incident with Gobert, Liverpool 
Football Club attempted to come back 
against Atletico Madrid in the second 
leg of their UEFA Champions League 
tie. Anfield, the home of the Reds, was 
packed to the gills and filled with song. 
Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp walked 
on to the pitch, greeted by fans putting 
their hands out to get a last-minute 
high-five. Klopp, normally one of the 
most friendly and flamboyant figures in 
world soccer, shouted at the fans, “Put 
your hands away you f*cking idiots!” 
Watching the video back, it’s obvious that 
Klopp was seething. As COVID-19 began 
to engulf Europe, Klopp knew holding a 
game was, as he described it, “criminal.”

I held out hope. I hoped the University 

of Michigan’s men’s basketball team 
would be able to make a run in the 
NCAA tournament, even with no 
fans. I prayed that Chelsea Football 
Club, my team, would be able to play 
their next Premier League match 
against Aston Villa. I looked forward 
to the Masters with optimism, 
hoping to see Tiger Woods defend his 
title — Surely it will be over by then, 
I thought. 

Now, it’s April 15, 2020, and a 

return of sports seems distant. 
A return of sports with packed 
stadiums feels near impossible. Who 
would’ve thought that my last game 
at The Big House might be the last 
one for years, not months?

To many, and to me early on, 

sports seemed immune to the virus. 
Games and matches could continue 
on, without fans if needed. Athletes 
with their health and physical ability 
could push through any infection. 
With over 604,000 cases in the 
United States as of April 14, it’s clear 
nothing is immune to COVID-19. Schools, 
restaurants and small businesses are all 
shuttered. This spring, it’s guaranteed 
there won’t be any rabid crowds of 
Michigan fans on South University 
Avenue celebrating a trip to the Final 
Four, no matter how slim the chances 
already were. 

Moments of joyous celebration like 

when the University reached the National 
Championship in 2018 showcases the 
feeling of community triumph created 
by sports. Now, charging out of the Blue 
Leprechaun onto the street to celebrate 
victory seems unimaginable. In times 
like these, with people dying from 
COVID-19 at alarming rates each day, 
with people shuttered in their homes 
and away from loved ones, that common 
thrill and excitement that sports bring is 
needed — something communities across 
the country can root for and unite behind 
is needed.

Even in times of violence and terror, 

sports were there. Mere weeks after 
9/11, then-President George W. Bush 
strode out onto the field at Game 3 of 
the World Series in the Bronx, donning a 
Fire Department of New York jacket and 
delivered a first pitch straight down the 
middle. Say what you will about the damn 
New York Yankees and say what you will 
about George W. Bush, but that first 
pitch in 2001 offered the same unity we 
could use now. It offered something we 
could rally behind and get away from the 
realities of everyday life — distract from 
the horrors and tragedy wrought. I’m 
not old enough to remember the moment 
live, but watching it again on Youtube, 
quarantined in my apartment, there is 

an undeniable energy of optimism and 
strength to move forward. 

Our country can only dream of a 

moment like that now. We cannot gather 
in a stadium to heal together, and to 
parallel Bush’s Fire Department of New 
York jacket — a symbol recognizing 
our collective strength and pride — the 
present-day jacket would have to be a 
bit larger to accommodate the doctors, 
nurses, 
caregivers, 
grocery 
store 

workers, postal workers and more who 
have sacrificed in this widespread battle 
against this virus.

For some, the virus denies a stalwart 

of everyday life. In most of my waking 
moments of the year that were not spent 
in class or with other people, I listened 
to soccer podcasts — Men in Blazers, 
Talking Tactics, London is Blue Podcast, 
the Football Daily, to name a few. 
Now, with virtually all sports canceled 
indefinitely, I no longer get to wake up at 
7:30 a.m. on a Saturday morning to watch 
the Premier League. I didn’t get to make 
a bracket for the NCAA Tournament. I 
didn’t get to watch the Masters on my 
computer in class on Thursday and Friday. 
It seems juvenile, and to a degree it is, but 
the shared adoration for something that 
transcends boundaries of politics, race, 
nationality and religion isn’t replicable. 
That adoration seems normal until we 
step back and see the uniqueness of it — 
so many of us distract ourselves in the 
same way through sports.

There’s also something to be said for 

the most vulnerable populations being 
robbed of seeing their teams succeed. 
My great-grandfather Richard Robin-
son, better known as Pop to his loved 
ones, lived his whole life in Massachu-

setts and always rooted for the Boston 
Red Sox. When the Red Sox won the 
2004 World Series and broke the Curse 
of the Bambino, Pop witnessed it all. 
The following year, he passed away at 
the age of 93. A pennant from that year 
hangs in my childhood room to this day. 

There were similar stories when 

the Chicago Cubs won in 2016. Those 
moments of jubilation and the moments of 
relief and celebration might not come for 
fans for some time in the wake of COVID-
19. Liverpool haven’t won a league title in 
England in 30 years. As things stand in 
the Premier League table, Liverpool are 
only a couple wins away from clinching 
their title that has seemed inevitable 
since December. No one knows when, or 
if, they will be able to resume their march 
to glory. Some supporters will likely have 
to spend another year waiting for their 
triumph.

For all the virtues of sports and my 

love for them, I do not advocate for their 
imminent return. Those who are pushing 
to return to sports soon are kidding 
themselves and endangering both fans 
and athletes. At this point, I don’t think 
there will be another Saturday at The 
Big House with 100,000 fans until there 
is an effective treatment or vaccine for 
COVID-19. Sports might be what the 
country needs, but they are not what 
it deserves. Whenever sports return 
with fans in seats, it will undoubtedly 
be a special moment — a true mark of 
victory. With any hope, fans can sit in 
the sun, take in a game and recognize 
those who sacrificed and saved to get us 
back to what we crave right now: safety, 
normalcy and peace.
