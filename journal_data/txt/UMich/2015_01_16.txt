Court orders to 
state to recognize 

marriages performed 

during March stay

By SHOHAM GEVA

Daily News Editor

In a decision announced Thurs-

day morning, a U.S District Court 
ruled that the state is required to 
recognize 300 same-sex marriages 
performed in Michigan last year.

In the ruling on the case, Caspar 

v. Snyder, Judge Mark Goldsmith 
wrote that once marriages have 
occurred, the state cannot retract 
them under the due process clause 
of the 14th Amendment.

“The same-sex couples who 

married in Michigan during the 
brief period when such marriages 
were authorized acquired a status 
that state officials may not ignore 
absent some compelling interest 
— a constitutional hurdle that the 
defense does not even attempt to 
surmount, ” the ruling read. “In 
these circumstances, what the 
state has joined together, it may not 
put asunder.”

If the state does not appeal the 

decision in the next 21 days, the 
marriages will become valid next 
month.

The marriages in question were 

performed during the day-long 
interim period between a March 
district court decision to strike 
down the state’s ban on same-sex 
marriage in DeBoer v. Snyder and 
the granting of a stay on that deci-

sion pending an appeal to the Sixth 
Circuit Court.

In a departure from decisions in 

favor of same-sex marriage legal-
ization across the country, the cir-
cuit court has since reversed the 
district’s court ruling, holding that 
the state’s ban, as well as several 
similar measures in Kentucky, Ohio 
and Tennessee, was constitutionally 
valid.

Plaintiffs in the case have since 

asked the U.S. Supreme Court to 
take up the issue. Justices heard 
the petition last week, but have yet 
to make a decision on whether they 
will take up the case.

As part of his ruling, Goldsmith 

also declined to issue a stay on the 
recognition of the marriages tied 
to the petition before the Supreme 
Court, which would have halted the 
ruling from coming into effect until 
the Supreme Court acted on the 
petition.

In a statement Thursday morn-

ing, Michigan Attorney General Bill 
Schuette, who requested the stay on 
the marriages and is litigating the 
case to protect the state’s ban, reiter-
ated previous calls for the Supreme 
Court to take up the issue.

“We are reviewing Judge Gold-

smith’s decision, but as I have said 
repeatedly, the sooner the United 
States Supreme Court makes a deci-
sion on this issue the better it will 
be for Michigan and America,” 
Schuette said.

In contrast to Schuette, the plain-

tiffs in the case, represented by the 
ACLU, have taken the position that a 
decision on the Michigan’s same-sex 
marriage ban would not impact the

Though Central Student Gov-

ernment previously announced 
plans 
to 
discontinue 
the 

Night Owl bus route, the body 
announced Wednesday that the 
service will continue.

As of last semester, CSG and 

the Interfraternity Council fund-
ed the Night Owl as a pilot pro-
gram, each contributing $15,000 
and hoping the University would 
assume responsibility for sus-
taining the program’s funding. In 
December, CSG said the Univer-
sity had not secured long-term 
funding.

University Parking and Trans-

portation Services has commit-

Session to focus 

on long-term 

policy initiatives 

with Schlissel 

By GENEVIVE HUMMER

Daily Staff Reporter

The University’s Board 

of Regents will meet this 
month for a strategic session 
closed to the public to dis-
cuss topics concerning the 
future of higher education.

Regent Denise Ilitch (D) 

wrote in an e-mail interview 
the meeting would focus on 
a diverse range of initiatives.

“We 
will 
be 
discuss-

ing 
Academic 
Excellence 

and its evolving direction, 
the Biosciences, Challeng-
es confronting the higher 
education business model, 
Diversity at UM, UM Health 
System and Athletics,” Ilitch 
wrote.

The 
meeting 
is 
also 

intended to recognize the 
one-year 
anniversary 
of 

the selection of University 
President Mark Schlissel, 
who was appointed by the 
regents to succeed President 
Emerita Mary Sue Coleman 
in January 2014.

Additionally, Ilitch said 

the sessions will give the 
board the opportunity to 
orient 
incoming 
Regent 

Michael Behm (D–Grand 
Blanc), who was elected 
in November 2014. Behm 
replaced 
outgoing 
regent 

Julia Darlow (D), who chose 
not to run for reelection.

This is the first of the 

strategic sessions to be held 
in Ann Arbor. In 2013 and 
2014, the regents traveled 
to California and New York, 
respectively.

In California, the regents 

met with Google research 
scientist Dan Russell, Stan-
ford University President 
John Hennessy and Robert 
Berdahl, former president of 
the Association of American 
Universities.

University alum’s 
donation to fund 
creation of new 
student center

By SHOHAM GEVA

Daily News Editor

The money keeps rolling in.
The Ross School of Business 

announced a new $20 million 
gift to the school Thursday 
morning.

Donated by former General 

Mills CEO Stephen W. Sanger, 
a University alum, and his 

wife Karen Sanger, a small 
business attorney, the gift will 
be used to create the Sanger 
Leadership Center.

In a press release, Ste-

phen Sanger lauded current 
Business School leadership 
programs, namely the Ross 
Leadership 
Initiative, 
and 

said he was honored to sup-
port the continued growth of 
additional opportunities.

“Among those of us who 

have recruited talent for our 
companies, one of the things 
that sets Ross graduates apart 
is their leadership skills,” 
Sanger said. “This differ-
ence reflects the innovative, 

hands-on programs of the 
Ross Leadership Initiative.”

The center will focus on 

sustaining current elements 
of the RLI. The initiative cur-
rently facilitates several pro-
grams for students, including 
yearly competitions to form 
profitable, socially minded 
businesses in Detroit, cri-
sis management simulations 
and workshops focused on 
self-reflection and leadership 
skills.

The center will also provide 

feedback for students and 
personalized coaching, along 
with resources for faculty 
working on innovative ideas 

or new leadership methodolo-
gies.

In 
a 
statement, 
Scott 

DeRue, the Business School’s 
associate dean and incoming 
faculty director of the Sanger 
Leadership Center, said its 
creation will increase the 
school’s unique capacities to 
provide leadership training.

“I envision a future where 

50,000 Michigan Ross stu-
dents — past, present and 
future — lead positive change 
in themselves and around the 
world,” DeRue said. “The cre-
ation of the Sanger Leader-
ship Center and the generous 

Mark Burde 

clarifies aspects 
of French satire in 
context of incident

By EMMA KINERY

Daily Staff Reporter

After millions filled the streets 

of France to honor the victims 
of the Charlie Hebdo shooting, 
French lecturer Mark Burde deliv-
ered a lecture titled “Satire and 

Society in France This Week and 
Last” at the Residential College’s 
French coffee hour on Thursday.

“About four million people 

marched in the entirety; the most 
people marching for any political 
reason, any reason at all, any sort 
of gathering, since World War II. 
It was a huge deal,” Burde said. 
“So the question is, why was this 
so important?”

The talk centered on the Paris 

shootings on Jan. 7, which killed 
12 people and wounded 11. The 
attack targeted specific cartoon-
ists and editorial staff of the 

French satirical magazine Charlie 
Hebdo. Carried out by two French 
Muslim brothers, the attack was 
a response to the magazine’s 
satirical publications featuring 
the Islamic prophet Muhammad. 
Images of the Prophet Muham-
mad are forbidden in the religion 
of Islam.

The attack prompted interna-

tional outcry as #JeSuisCharlie 
went viral. However, some have 
been critical of expressing total 
support for the publication, which 
many say prints satirical cartoons

Program seeks 

to facilitate 

interdiscplinary 
problem-solving

BY CARLY NOAH

Daily Staff Reporter

Graduate students from nine 

University schools and colleges 
have been named Dow Sustain-
ability Fellows, the University 
announced Monday.

The 
fellowship 
includes 
a 

$20,000 scholarship, as well as 
the opportunity to work closely 
with a community of scholars 
focused on issues in sustainability.

Forty students who are cur-

rently enrolled in master’s or 
professional programs at the 
University were named to the 
year-long fellowship. They were 
selected from a group of nominees 
from 11 programs across campus. 
Each school or college could name 

up to 10 candidates.

This group composes one divi-

sion of the Dow Sustainability 
Master’s/Professional Fellows at 
the University, as the program 
also offers fellowships for doctor-
al and postdoctoral students.

The program is comprised of 

students focused on interdisci-
plinary approaches to a variety of 
sustainability challenges, includ-
ing issues with water, energy, 
transportation, the built environ-
ment, climate change, food and 
health, among other challenges.

Besides working alongside the 

Dow Sustainability doctoral and 
postdoctoral fellows, the students 
will also participate in an interdis-
ciplinary team project designed to 
provide experience tackling real-
world challenges.

Don Scavia, director of the Gra-

ham Sustainability Institute, said 
in an e-mail part of the program’s 
success stems from collabora-
tions of students from different 
disciplines. He wrote that the fel-
lowship offers students a unique 

opportunity to add practical expe-
rience to their academic pursuits.

“They will be much better pre-

pared for tackling complex prob-
lems no matter what sector they 
chose to work in — corporate, gov-
ernment, NGO, academic — upon 
graduation,” he wrote.

He also emphasized the pro-

gram’s importance to the Univer-
sity, noting the fellowship conveys 
the power of a public university to 
prepare students to solve complex 
sustainability challenges.

“We are not aware of any uni-

versity, nationally or globally, that 
has anything like this — train-
ing over 75 masters, professional, 
doctoral, and postdoctoral stu-
dents each year in the nuances of 
addressing sustainability,” Scavia 
wrote.

Engineering graduate student 

Selman Mujovic, one of the stu-
dents named as a fellow, said he 
looks forward to using the skills 
from his interdisciplinary project 
team to impact the world. Mujo-
vic is currently working inde-
pendently on a water purification 
project and said he hopes the fel-
lowship will help him navigate the 
process of implementing it.

“I didn’t know that so many 

different schools were involved 
in the fellowship,” Mujovic said. 
“I originally thought that it was 
specifically for the College of 
Engineering. I’m looking forward 
to working with the other fellows 
to collectively implement various 
sustainability projects.”

Business 
graduate 
student 

Daniel Patton, also a new fel-
low, wrote in an e-mail that he 
expects the most rewarding part 
the program will be the oppor-
tunity to work across fields of 
study. Patton added that the fel-
lowship is unique in the way that 
sustainability challenges can be 
discussed among some of the top 
graduate students in the country.

“Sustainability 
challenges 

can be hard nuts to crack,” Pat-
ton wrote. “Often one perspec-
tive is not enough. I hope to gain 
concrete experience developing 
solutions that extend my field of

Clean energy, education funding 
among focuses for A2 legislators

Irwin, Zemke talk 

new initiatives 
as 2015 session 

commences 

BY JACK TURMAN

Daily Staff Reporter

As Michigan’s 98th legisla-

tive session kicked off Wednes-
day, Rep. Jeff Irwin (D–Ann 
Arbor) and Rep. Adam Zemke 
(D–Ann Arbor) returned to 
Lansing with several priorities 
on their agendas.

In an interview Thursday, 

Zemke said he plans to empha-
size education funding during 
the upcoming session. Zemke, 
who is in his second term repre-
senting Michigan’s 55th House 
District, said last session he 
focused on supporting educa-
tors and improving school dis-
tricts, including those in high 
poverty communities.

He said a chief concern for 

the current legislative session is 
that education could take a hit 
following a House Fiscal Agen-
cy projection of a $454 million 
shortfall in the state’s general 
budget, released Wednesday.

“We really have to work to 

preserve funding at the current 
levels,” Zemke said. “And really 
it should be increased, but espe-
cially given a budget deficit of 
$460 million, you’re talking 
about a lot of items that we have 
to watch.”

He cited Republican Gov. 

Rick Snyder’s package to fund 
infrastructure repairs, which 
would cut 20 percent of state 
appropriations to higher educa-
tion from the School Aid Fund, 
shifting much of the responsi-
bility for funding public univer-
sities to the General Fund.

Zemke said that loss of money 

from the School Aid Fund, pre-
served for community college 
and K-12 education, has poten-
tially negative implications for 
higher education funding.

“University funding would 

then have to come out of the 
General Fund solely,” he said. 
“With the projected shortfall 
of the budget, we’ve really got 
to be watching that university 
funding to make sure that the 
budget is not balanced the backs 
of students.”

In an interview Thursday, 

Irwin also identified high-
er education funding as an 
important area for the legisla-
ture, noting in particular how 
higher education funding has 
decreased in the last decade.

“Michigan used to be a real 

leader in the nation in terms of 
education policy,” Irwin said. 
“Over the course of the last 
decade, especially the last two 
years, we’ve really fallen off 
that pace.”

To return to the state’s for-

mer stature, Irwin said Michi-
gan must engage the public and 
bring education to the forefront 
of the political agenda.

“Clearly, we need to get back 

to a place where Michigan is 
making higher ed a priority 
and the public is investing more 
in our institutions of higher 
learning so that we can control 
tuition and could try to control 
student debt,” he said.

Irwin, who is in his final term 

of representing Michigan’s 53rd 
District, also said he wants to 
renew state energy efficiency 
policy and push the develop-
ment of more clean energy 
resources in the state.

Irwin cited Michigan’s Pub-

lic Act 295 — which was signed 
into law in 2008, but expired 
this year — as a focus. The act 
was a state initiative to reduce 
the amount of non-renewable 
energy used by utilities owned 
by the state.

Irwin said Public Act 295 

required that 10 percent of 
power be generated by renew-
ables by 2015. Irwin also noted 
many 
citizens 
advocated 

against the act because of its 
costs.

“But, the reality is that in the 

last seven years, we’ve had tre-
mendous success,” Irwin said. 

“Renewable power has come in 
cheaper than anybody expect-
ed.”

Along with pushing for con-

tinued clean energy, Irwin said 
he has already introduced a bill 
this session that calls for a grad-
uated income tax in the state. 
Currently, Michigan has a flat-
rate personal income tax. Under 
a graduated income tax, indi-
viduals with higher incomes 
would pay a larger percentage 
of their income toward the tax 
than those with lower incomes.

Irwin has introduced this 

proposal to session in his first 
term, second term and now 
third term.

Irwin also said he wants to 

change the adoption policy in 
the state. Currently, only het-
erosexual couples can adopt a 
child. Irwin said he wants to 
reform the policy to allow sec-
ond-parent adoption, which is 
currently not legal in the state. 
Second-parent adoption refers 
to parents who cannot legally 
marry, such as same-sex cou-
ples.

“It is especially important 

because you’ve got children in 
the state of Michigan who are 
living in these homes,” he said. 
“They are living in the homes 
headed by either heterosexual 
or homosexual couples who did 
not wish to marry.”

Irwin 
said 
the 
children 

are at a severe disadvantage 
because they don’t receive cer-
tain legal benefits.

“Those kids deserve the 

same rights as kids who are 
adopted into married families,” 
Irwin said. “The way that our 
law are currently comprised, 
those children who are adopt-
ed into those families have 
less rights to inheritance, less 
rights to health care benefits, 
hospital visitation.”

Though not a policy pro-

posal, Zemke also announced 
Wednesday that he is commit-
ted to tweeting every vote he 
casts and why he is casting that 
particular vote during this ses-

Mujovic added that he hopes

lasting effects in the sustain-
ability community.

“Although the program is

ence will last 10 times that and 
will extend beyond our starting

tapped to serve as the Univer-
sity of Michigan Health System’s 
interim chief executive officer 
after the departure of former 
UMHS CEO Ora Pescovitz.

The trip also included several 

development events, including 
a dinner fundraiser at Lincoln 
Center. The events cost $90,000 
and were paid for with Office of 
Development funds.

Regent Katherine White (D) 

wrote in an e-mail interview 
that the meeting is local this 
year because they will not be 
meeting with external higher 
ed officials, as they’ve done in 
the past.

“This meeting is internally 

focused and we will neither be 
meeting with outside speakers 
nor traveling outside the state 
of Michigan,” White wrote. 
“Instead, this session is to give 
the Board an opportunity to 
have long-term strategic ses-
sions with our new President, 
Dr. Mark Schlissel.”

White, who chairs the board, 

did not attend the trips to Cali-
fornia or New York.

Prior to 2013, the regents typi-

cally held a public meeting in 
January, as they do each month 
apart from August.

This semester, Schlissel has 

expressed interest in several 
new initiatives at the Univer-
sity, including streamlining the 

University’s sustainability ini-
tiatives and working to increase 
diversity at the University.

White stressed the impor-

tance of the board in helping 
Schlissel to shape University 
policies.

“The Board of Regents has 

taken the role of overall gov-
ernance and has delegated the 
day to day operations of the uni-
versity to the President,” White 
wrote. “In other words, the 
Board sets and approves policies 
for the university and provides 
oversight. The President, in con-
sultation with the Board, crafts 
university policies.”

Most recently, Schlissel has 

begun efforts to combat sexu-
al assault and misconduct on 
campus. In an e-mail Monday, 
Schlissel notified students of 
a survey aimed at gauging the 
campus climate related to sexual 
misconduct.

In the e-mail, Schlissel said a 

number of students had already 
approached him about their 
encounters with the topic of sex-
ual misconduct.

“During my first semester 

as president, I spent a great 
deal of time engaging with the 
campus community in various 
forums, fireside chats, inter-
views, and other informal meet-
ings,” Schlissel wrote. “At many 
of these sessions, students spoke 
openly and personally about 
sexual assault issues at the Uni-
versity of Michigan, or wrote me 
directly to share their views on 
this very important issue.”

Ilitch voiced her support of 

Schlissel’s sexual misconduct 
initiative and affirmed that the 
board would be actively involved 
in crafting any related policies 
during the upcoming semester.

“The Regents will play a very 

active role on this vitally impor-
tant topic,” Ilitch said.

recognition of the marriages.

Law Prof. Julian Mortenson, 

who argued part of the case as a 
cooperating attorney, said in an 
interview Thursday afternoon 
that though a Supreme Court 
decision on the same-sex mar-
riage bans would set precedent, 
the decision handed down in 
this case was not particularly 
groundbreaking.

“The decision that came out 

today is grounded in — as the 
district court judge found — lit-
erally centuries of Anglo-Amer-
ican precedent recognizing that 
when people have validly been 
married according to the laws of 
the jurisdiction they live in, they 
are entitled to remain married,” 
he said. “So in that sense it is a 
completely unexceptional, well-
reasoned, thoughtful, careful, 
scrupulous application of that 
long-standing grounded princi-
ple of Anglo-American law to the 
particular facts here. I mean, it’s 
certainly enormously significant 
for our clients.”

Also in an interview Thurs-

day 
afternoon, 
Jay 
Kaplan, 

staff attorney with the ACLU of 
Michigan’s LGBT project, said 
the key distinction in Caspar v. 
Snyder was that it focused on the 
right of couples to stay married, 

not whether same-sex couples 
can get married.

“The DeBoer case, though the 

incredibly important case that 
it is, is about the right of same-
sex couples to get married,” 
Kaplan said. “In this case, our 
couples are married. They were 
legally married in Michigan in 
accordance with Michigan law 
on March 22nd of 2014. And our 
case is about the right to stay 
married because the state, in 
saying that these marriages are 
legal but we’re not recognizing 
these marriages, are in essence 
invalidating these marriages. 
They can’t constitutionally do 
that. And the judge agreed with 
us.”

Gov. Rick Snyder’s office did 

not respond to a request for com-
ment on how the state will pro-
ceed with the ruling. However, 
following the Sixth Circuit’s 
decision in November, Snyder 
released a statement stating that 
he does not see the marriages as 
valid under the state constitu-
tion.

“The Court of Appeals deci-

sion does not allow for state 
benefits of marriage for those 
same-sex couples in accordance 
with our state constitution,” the 
November statement read. “That 
decision only can be changed if 
today’s Appeals Court ruling is 
overturned.”

gift from the Sangers mark a 
major leap forward in achiev-
ing this important vision.”

The donation comes as part 

of the Victors for Michigan 
campaign, a University-wide 
effort to raise $4 billion. As of 
early December, the campaign 
surpassed its halfway point, 
with $2.49 billion raised thus 
far.

The Business School has 

been the beneficiary of sev-
eral other campaign contribu-
tions, including half of a $200 
million donation gifted by real 
estate tycoon Stephen Ross in 
2013. His landmark gift was 
the University’s highest mon-
etary donation received in the 
school’s nearly 200-year his-
tory.

More recently, the Univer-

sity announced a $50 million 
donation by Ron and Eileen 
Weiser for several construc-
tion projects, including ren-
ovations to the Dennison 
building.

Business sophomore Jor-

dan Katz said he thought that 
if implemented right, which 
he added he was confident it 
would be, the center would 
attract high levels of student 
participation.

“I think it’s great,” Katz said. 

“I think a big focus here at Ross 
is on leadership and leading 
successful companies that do 
the right thing, and I think it 
gives students a great opportu-
nity to learn about that.”

established 
last 
year, 
was 

designed particularly for Univer-
sity students living off-campus.

CSG President Bobby Dishell, 

a Public Policy senior, said that 
until Wednesday, CSG was under 
the impression the program 
would be discontinued, noting 
that CSG never intended to per-
manently run the program.

“The intent was always for the 

University to pick it up,” Dishell 
said. “We’re incredibly grate-
ful that the budget for this year 
has been set and the University 
found a way to pick up the cost of 
this bus route.”

According to the CSG press 

release, Night Owl has trans-
ported 12,598 riders in the past 
year.

“That time period when Night 

Owl runs is the highest period 

for crime,” Dishell said. “The 
fact that the University has rec-
ognized that is saying ‘Hey, this 
is important to us, and we want 
to make sure that students get 
home safely.’ ”

A 2014 CSG release stated 

that 84 percent of University 
crime alerts occurred late at 
night, with 67 percent of inci-
dents happening off-campus.

Steve Dolen, executive direc-

tor of Parking and Transporta-
tion Services, said Night Owl 
is an underused transportation 
service and its utility will have 
to be further evaluated.

“The Oxford bus route is 

similar to Night Owl, but Night 
Owl has roughly 30 percent of 
the ridership of Oxford, and the 
Oxford bus route itself is lightly 
used,” he said.

Dolen also said Safe Ride is a 

viable alternative to Night Owl 
for late night off-campus trans-
portation. The program is a 

free University ride service that 
transports students, faculty and 
staff to their homes or vehicles 
within one mile of campus.

“Off-campus 
is 
broadly 

defined,” Dolen said. “Night Owl 
does not touch that much of the 
off-campus neighborhoods.”

Though it has only been con-

firmed that Night Owl will oper-
ate this semester, both Dishell 
and CSG Vice President Emily 
Lustig, a LSA senior, hope the 
service will expand and con-
tinue to run following the end of 
this semester.

“We’d like to expand it up 

into the North Campus area 
and 
serve 
those 
students,” 

Lustig said. “That’s a lot of the 
feedback we’ve been given, but 
unfortunately 
that 
doubles, 

or more, the budget and time. 
Eventually, in the coming years 
that would be the ultimate goal 
— to really reach all of the off-
campus population.”

that are inappropriate and disre-
spectful.

Burde said the goal of the lec-

ture was to clarify some aspects 
of French society which are 
lesser known to Americans and 
to help explain why Charlie 
Hebdo is so controversial as a 
publication. Under French law 
it is illegal to publish anything 
attacking a racial group; how-
ever, it is legal to publish attacks 
against ideologies such as reli-
gion.

“There 
are 
considerably 

stronger speech laws in France, 
hate speech laws, than there are 
in the States,” Burde said.

France has two major satiri-

cal magazines, Charlie Hebdo 
and Le Canard enchaîné. Hebdo 
publishes in a similar style to 
that of Mad Magazine: “male 
adolescent humor,” as Burde 
puts it, “on a very serious topic.”

“There are two essential char-

acteristics, I think, of French 
society that you need to be aware 
of, without which you will not 
really fully understand why 
Charlie Hebdo did what they did 
and why so many people are so 
fervent in defending their value, 
their right to do what they did,” 
Burde said.

These 
characteristics 
are 

“la gouaille” and “laïcité.” “La 
gouaille” is the French tradition 
of satire, typically between peo-
ple of different classes. Burde’s 
presentation exhibited examples 
from the late 1700s to show how 

embedded “la gouaille” is in 
French culture.

The second component, “laïci-

té,” is France’s separation of 
church and state, which extends 
to other aspects of life to mean a 
general space without religious 
interference.

LSA freshman Isaiah Zeavin-

Moss, who is in the Residential 
College, said he and other stu-
dents benefited from the lecture.

“I think Mark did a really 

great job of introducing us all to a 
little bit of the context of Charlie 
Hebdo and where they’re com-
ing from, who they are, and what 
the general satirical landscape 
is in France, and incorporating 
that into how to compare it to the 
satirical landscape in America,” 
he said.

Zemke said he hoped to do 

this last term, but the initiative 
didn’t materialize.

“When we got into this 

term, I said ‘You know what, 
we’re going to set a precedent. 
It’s a new term. We’re starting 
fresh,’ ” he said.

He 
added 
that 
citizens 

should know what the govern-
ment is doing, which is why he 
wants to improve the trans-
parency of his actions.

“There’s going to be a lot 

issues that are going to be 
posted that they probably will 
have not much interest in and 
we recognize that,” he said. 
“We’re going to try and be as 
concise as possible and make 
the information available.”

T

he New Year has just rolled 
in. Full of promise, 2015 
is said to actually be the 

year of change. 
Resolutions have 
been set, wheth-
er 
thoughtfully 

planned 
out 
or 

drunkenly thrown 
together at 11:53 
p.m. on New Year’s 
Eve. We strive to 
start out the New 
Year with goals 
that 
will 
make 

us better people, 
healthier people and happier people. 
But come a month later, do they even 
stick? What kinds of resolutions 
have been made, and what kind of 
success can be foretold by the nature 
of the resolution? If it is vague, say, 
“be a happier person,” is it more like-
ly to fail? If it is specific, say, “eat a 
salad for dinner three times a week,” 
is it more likely to succeed?

I believe we make resolutions 

because we appreciate a fresh start, 
a way to say that what we have done 
in the past is just that: in the past. 
Jan. 1 is a way to have the past year 
forgive us and the New Year give 
us a chance. We want to show that 
we have the ability to make these 
promises and keep them; that we 
can commit and succeed at these 
personal tasks. Do we feel guilty if 

we start to falter in our resolutions 
by February? What about July?

I began with myself, for how will 

I best understand others’ resolu-
tions if I cannot identify some for 
my own well-being? My goals: lose 
15 pounds, keep my desk clean, 
shrug off the little stuff. Three 
supposedly simple goals, but I will 
see how the next few months pan 
out. I have learned through many 
failed resolutions that I need more 
tangible and simple goals. A list of 
three is much easier for me to man-
age with a busy lifestyle. Having an 
extensive reason also helps to solid-
ify the resolutions, making them 
more pertinent to your life, a better 
reason of “why I need this,” rather 
than “just because.” Losing weight 
is specifically geared to certain jobs 
for which I am applying, the desk is 
so I have a clean workspace and will 
be encouraged to avoid procrasti-
nation, and shrugging off the little 
stuff is to keep my mind focused on 
the important aspects of my life. By 
having reasons, we are able to con-
tinue with our resolutions because 
they have meaning in our lives, 
whether they are a goal down the 
road or a day-to-day task.

Sometimes we need help, and we 

should not be afraid to seek it. At the 
beginning of the New Year, we look 
for ways to best complete our goals 
with helpful hints from BuzzFeed 

articles, using our friends to encour-
age each other, looking at others’ 
habits and setting reminders on 
phones and computers. I know this 
works for me: my roommate’s desk 
is spotless and I would like it to 
look like hers. My friend and I will 
drag each other to the gym and do 
workouts together. It is much more 
successful when you are able to 
combine resolutions, providing a 
lower chance of failure when two 
bodies are pushing for the same 
goal. But many of our mental reso-
lutions are personal, where we need 
to think to ourselves about how we 
manage situations and how we can 
change our mentalities.

According to Stephen Covey, 

author of the book “7 Habits of 
Highly Effective People,” it takes 30 
days for a habit to become solidified, 
whether it be forming a new one or 
breaking an old one. If we go by what 
Covey says, then the month of Janu-
ary is the most crucial. We need to be 
more active in remembering our res-
olutions so that they will, hopefully, 
become part of our routine: forming 
good habits, breaking bad habits and 
keeping the resolutions that we said 
we would. And just think, maybe 
keeping your resolutions can be a 
resolution. Good luck!

T

he podcast revolution is upon us, and 
at its forefront is “Serial” — a spin-
off of “This American Life.” Dictated 

by Sarah Koenig, “Serial” 
investigates the 1999 murder 
of Korean-American high 
school student Hae Min Lee. 
However, what at first seems 
to be a reporting endeavor 
quickly becomes the process 
of garnering an acquittal 
for Adnan Syed, the ex-boy-
friend of Lee who was con-
victed of her murder. He has 
maintained his innocence 
for 15 years. 

Koenig’s voice began to feel like a compan-

ion of mine — accompanying me along long car 
rides, walking me to class, annoying me with 
her repetitive claims. Her obsession is ground-
ed in the need to truly uncover what happened 
on Jan. 13, the day of Lee’s killing. The spin 
is that, unlike very hard journalism, Koenig 
manifests the desire to prove Adnan Syed’s 
innocence, given that the only real evidence 
connecting him to the crime is the very shaky 
witness testimony of one Jay Wilds. 

Koenig approaches inconsistencies in events, 

the sheer lack of physical evidence linking 
Adnan to the murder and a drive to uncover the 
truth in an honest tone — one reminiscent of 
something you might hear in “This American 
Life” or “Radiolab.” But different than these 
other podcasts which, in some cases, divulge 
almost too much information about their sub-
jects in one episode, “Serial” focuses on the 
same people, on the same story, with new inter-
spersed information for 12 episodes. There is 
a ton of information shared about the victim, 
Hae, the supposed perpetrator, Adnan, and 
their respective families, friends and lives.

It’s easy to say that this podcast was pro-

duced in the name of journalism — that is to say, 
in the name of uncovering the truth. However, 
the element remains that this podcast was also 
produced in the name of entertainment. Crime 
investigation stories are so popular because 
crime is so sexy. The haunting nature of mur-
der is alluring in that, when talked about over 
a podcast, one can be distanced from the actual 
act of it. But if the whole consumer base is so 
invested in “Serial” because of its entertain-
ment purposes, how is it ethical? Given the 
incredible rarity of appealing and overturning a 
conviction, do people really think that Adnan’s 
case will conveniently be overturned by the 
end of the 12th episode? And further, when any 
white woman enters a scene and picks apart 
the relations between two kids with immigrant 
parents — a Korean-American girl and a Mus-
lim boy of Pakistani descent — there is bound 
to be a component of white saviorism buried 
within the story.

There is a point midway through the season, 

during episode six, when Koenig unknowingly 
illustrates a motive she might not be conscious-
ly aware of: her desire to play heroine to Adnan. 
During this episode, Adnan asks Koenig over 
the phone, “Why are you doing this?” To which 
she replies, “My interest in it has honestly been 
you. Like, you’re a really nice guy.” His response 
to that is surprising to Koenig — he claims that 
she doesn’t really know him at all. She’s com-
pletely taken aback by this, and in her com-
mentary, she calls his remark almost hostile. 
His honesty is considered to be hostile when it 

doesn’t congratulate her. 

While disturbed by Koenig’s interpretation 

of Adnan’s feelings, I also saw a lot of myself in 
her. Over two years ago, I began volunteering 
in prisons through the Prison Creative Arts 
Project, facilitating creative arts workshops 
for male prisoners. My first workshop, a the-
ater class, took place at the Michigan Reforma-
tory in Ionia, Michigan For two hours a week, 
my partner and I introduced 10 men to the-
ater. I loved being there, providing a space for 
their creative expression, but during my first 
workshop I also felt myself loving my place in 
the situation. They’d share stories about their 
lives, and in doing so, I felt that I knew them 
— from head to toe. This was not the case. It 
took a downturn of events and experience in 
another prison facility to understand that this 
work was not intended to assuage me, and that 
being in a creative space with someone for two 
hours a week did not mean I knew their story 
in its entirety. 

Koenig’s feelings are human ones. It’s even a 

little refreshing to see her playing the heroine 
and simultaneously expressing an overabun-
dance of doubt. And perhaps part of the point of 
“Serial” is to show this raw side to investigative 
journalism. But in doing so, it becomes unfair 
to Adnan. It’s a two-faced approach in which 
Koenig is willing to be the savior, but in real-
ity is questioning whether or not Adnan should 
even be saved. 

About a month ago, when “Serial” was still 

the number one buzzword, two individuals 
asked me separately, “Have you listened to 
‘Serial?’ You know the part with the Inno-
cence Project? That’s what I want to do!” 
For people who had never before expressed 
interest in helping the incarcerated, or get-
ting wrong convictions overturned, this was 
shocking to me. Listening to a podcast had 
actually formulated the desire to help the 
imprisoned. Naturally, since I am working 
with the incarcerated myself, I questioned 
their motives. But the truth is, if “Serial” 
can safely introduce people to a prisoner, 
Adnan, and show them how human he is, 
then maybe it’s accomplishing a lot more 
than entertainment.

There are real ethical issues to “Serial.” 

Koenig, although sensitively, reveals anec-
dotes, diary entries and family issues of Hae’s 
that morph her into a storyline, rather than a 
dead girl whose black hair was found peeking 
out of a shallow grave. Adnan, who’s been in 
prison since 1999, is now known all around 
the nation — his innocence discussed in class-
rooms and raging debates on whether he did 
or did not strangle his ex-girlfriend with his 
bare hands. For me, for some reason, I don’t 
really care if he did or didn’t do it. What’s so 
impressive about “Serial” is its smart inves-
tigation, attention to small details, personal 
accounts and, most importantly, its exhibi-
tion of Adnan’s humanity. Maybe it’s a feat of 
entertainment. But if it is inspiring to people, 
if it is allowing them to look at the many facets 
of crime and those involved in it, then, I guess, 
who cares if it’s entertainment? As for Koenig, 
even if she’s looking for that pat on the back 
throughout the whole series, I guess we can 
forgive her. Because she’s human — just like 
Adnan, just like you and just like me.

The ethics of Serial

T

hey say you never realize how much 
you miss something until it is taken 
away from you.

A loved one who passes 

away, a friend who moves 
across the country, my old 
Pokémon Blue video game 
that my mom always took 
away from me when I was 
grounded — we all face these 
trying times in our lives. 
Goodbyes are essential to 
existence, however tough 
and unexplained.

There are many charming 

things about this University, and somewhere 
down on that list, right after “has class in Wine 
Tasting,” are our wonderful cafeterias. After 
all, at what other school can you take a date to 
a $60 million restaurant for the low cost of a 
guest-meal swipe? Way to go, South Quad.

Most of my dining hall experiences involved 

stealing entire trays of cookies, storing them in 
Tupperware and carrying them to my room, 
as well as Frosted Flakes and salad with every 
meal because I’m a responsible college student. 
But also intrinsically tied to the experience was 
the impossible game of Tetris that was fitting 
multiple circular plates onto a square piece of 
plastic. But some men just want to watch the 

world burn, and thus, we were forced to part 
ways with our plastic dining companions.

Okay, that’s probably a little harsh. There 

are reasonable explanations for getting rid of 
them: saving water and resources needed to 
wash them, cutting down on food waste or 
more subtly training those of us who won’t be 
employed after graduation in the art of balanc-
ing multiple plates for our future of waiting 
tables. Rather, the real shame is that two years 
removed from their fateful departure, the 
Michigan winters have only become harder to 
endure as the main vehicle for being transport-
ed from point A on top of a snowy hill to point 
B at the bottom is no more, and it still hurts.

Sledding on a cafeteria tray has been a rite 

of passage for college students throughout 
the ages. In the college universe, where a sled 
would take up about 27 percent of the floor 
space in our tiny rooms, the cafeteria tray was 
a hero. It was not the hero that we deserved, 
but the one we needed.

At its surface, it is nothing more than a 

rectangular piece of plastic with some glossy 
coating that is almost certainly not environ-
mentally friendly. But the uses of the tray are 
limitless. One day, someone had the idea to use 
it as a means of carrying food around. Another 
saw a snowy hill, lacked a full-featured sled 
and knew exactly what he was going to use

Dying a hero

instead. One day, I came back to my 
dorm room with the aforementioned 
12-by-18-inch piece of plastic and 
decided to use it as a doormat for my 
wet shoes.

The cafeteria tray was the pin-

nacle of college resourcefulness. 
The average college student is broke, 
living and keeping all of his or her 

essential belongings in a room about 
the size of a walk-in closet, but the 
tray was a source of empowerment. 
It may be gone for now, but its impact 
will be felt forever. We never said 
thank you to this dark knight, and 
we’ll never have to.

No memoir could do these rectan-

gular squares of freedom justice. It is 

said that you either die a hero or live 
long enough to see yourself become 
the villain. The cafeteria tray is for-
ever the former.

Yet riddle me this: Bursley still 

has them.

Those of you who are particu-

larly social media-savvy might have 
noticed an interesting hashtag orbit-
ing the Twittersphere as of late: 
#BargeX. Amidst the rumbles and 
flashes of #JeSuisCharlie, Air Asia 
and George Zimmerman, six cryp-
tic letters can be easy to miss. What 
does it all mean anyway? In short, a 
space company (almost!) landed a 
rocket on a boat from orbit. Big deal? 
Yes. Here’s how they did it:

On Jan. 10 at 4:47 a.m., the Space 

Exploration 
and 
Technologies 

Corporation, popularly known as 
SpaceX, launched an unmanned 
rocket — the Falcon 9 — to the Inter-
national Space Station to replenish 
supplies there. This time, though, 
this routine mission had an added 
twist. Usually, after a rocket’s first 
stage booster separates from its 
payload high in the atmosphere 
(travelling at around 1,300 meters 
per second, or nearly four times the 
speed of sound), it’s allowed to sim-
ply fall out of orbit into one of the 
conveniently located oceans below 
for “splashdown.” However, last 
Saturday, the thrusters on the first 
stage were reignited, reorienting 
the booster in the atmosphere, turn-
ing its free fall to the Earth’s sur-
face into an elegant controlled dive. 
This itself is mind-bogglingly diffi-
cult — SpaceX itself described it as 
“trying to balance a rubber broom-
stick on your hand in the middle of a 
 

wind storm.”

Obviously, hitting a boat at Mach 4 

would make quite a mess. The rocket 
had to slow its sharp descent and 
reduce its speed. So began a number 
of controlled ‘burns,’ or firings of the 
engine, that attempted to reduce the 
speed of the 14-story rocket from 
Mach 4 to about two meters per sec-

ond, which is the speed of a brisk jog.

Let that sink in for a moment.
To further complicate matters, 

the unanchored boat (or barge, as 
some are calling it) that the rocket 
was aiming for was at the mercy of 
the tide, despite having powerful 
thrusters to stabilize it.

To even have a chance of hitting 

the target, the booster had to have 
a high-precision course adjustment 
system, which basically means a 
really good steering wheel. It relied 
on its brand-new fins for that. Fold-
ing out from the chassis à la X-Wing 
in “attack formation,” each fin was 
programmed to move independent-
ly to change the direction of the 
booster in each of the three dimen-
sions: roll, pitch and yaw. Combine 
that with an engine mounted on a 
set of gimbals that allow it to roll, 
pitch and yaw as well, and you end 
up with a rocket that can practi-
cally fly itself!

And that’s exactly what it did; 

the whole process described above 
was performed autonomously. No 
human was involved in the landing 
of this rocket.

So that’s what was supposed to 

happen. Unfortunately, rocket sci-
ence and engineering is hard, and is 
rife with false starts and missteps. 
On the upside, the engine burns did 
their jobs, and the Falcon 9 booster 
made contact with the barge. Well, 
contact is actually the wrong word: 
the booster slammed into the barge 
and broke apart on impact. The 
problem was that the hydraulic 
fluid used to operate those steer-
able fins ran out before landing, and 
the spacecraft couldn’t slow down 
enough without them.

OK, so it didn’t work this time. 

Why should you care? Well, being 

able to actually land a rocket means 
we can reuse it, for one. And we can 
do it, no doubt.

SpaceX plans to try again in one 

of its other seven planned resup-
ply missions, this time with more 
hydraulic fluid. But it’s space. Pro-
verbially, space is always over there, 
seeming disconnected from the rest 
of us. Why spend $900 million to 
develop a rocket only to pull some 
silly stunt with a barge? Some jus-
tify the expense as an investment: 
if rockets can be reused, spaceflight 
becomes cheaper, and space becomes 
accessible to more than just coun-
tries, corporations and universities. 
We at SEDS (Students for the Explo-
ration and Development of Space), 
meanwhile, support this endeavor 
simply because any significant stride 
in space is unequivocally a boon for 
humanity as a whole. The effort to 
make space accessible to society has 
an importance on a scientific and 
technological level that cannot be 
understated. Yet, it is just as impor-
tant as another step in expanding 
our understanding of the universe. 
As some famous astrophysicists are 
wont to say, “We are star stuff.”

Look, this is 2015. This is the year 

Marty McFly shows up and sees 
hover boards, flying cars and self-
tying shoelaces and a future that 
seems ... cool! We might not have fly-
ing cars today, but how about a rocket 
that can fly itself to space and back? 
Or a space program that operates on 
timelines of weeks, not months or 
years? That’s a future worth building.

Ad Astra, my friends.

‘Sunny’ starting 
to show its age

FXX

You don’t wanna watch it, but you will ... because of the implication.

By CHLOE GILKE

Managing Arts Editor

Watching “It’s Always Sunny 

in Philadelphia” is like com-
ing home to visit your high 
school friends. 
There’s a cer-
tain 
comfort 

in hanging out 
with the old 
gang, knowing 
the ins and outs 
of their humor 
and anticipat-
ing every beat 
and punchline. 
You sit down, 
beer in hand, 
easily 
falling 

back into the 
rhythm of your 
former self, the person who used 
to love these idiots with all your 
heart. You secretly hope for 
something beyond such a super-
ficial connection — some sign 
that they’re real, evolving peo-
ple and not just a walking year-
book photo, but they’re always, 
tragically, the same people you 
left at home. And when you visit, 
sure enough, they’re still sloppy, 
silly and juvenile. That’s not 
necessarily a bad thing, but you 
can’t help but feel a little sad for 
the gulf that’s formed between 
you and your gang.

After 10 seasons on the air, 

“It’s Always Sunny in Phila-
delphia” is finally beginning to 
show its age. The premiere epi-
sode, “The Gang Beats Boggs,” 
pulls every trick in the show’s 
arsenal, mashing the premises 
of previous episodes into a post-
modern mess. I really wanted to 
love this episode. My “Sunny” 
obsession commenced at the 
end of the ninth season and just 
before that brutal 14-month hia-
tus, so I’ve been counting down 
the days to this episode like I 
was anticipating going home.

But this episode was so disap-

pointingly formulaic that even 
I, Queen of All Things “Sunny,” 
could feel the clouds. “The Gang 
Beats Boggs” finds the Paddy’s 
crew aboard a plane to Los 
Angeles, hoping to beat baseball 
player Wade Boggs’s mythical 
mile-high drinking record. They 
tally the beers they’ve consumed 
with marks on their shirts. (To 
stretch this metaphor as far as 
it’ll go, I’ll make my own tally 
of the “Sunny” cliches that this 
episode regurgitates. One for 
“the gang plays a game and gets 
way too competitive.” Two for 
“a journey outside of Philly, fea-
turing general hijinks.”)

Dee (Kaitlin Olson, “The 

Heat”) is the drunkest from the 
outset, her beer tally already in 
the teens when she boards. She 
slurps down can after can, spi-
raling into self-destruction and 
masochism until finally ending 
up face-down on a luggage car-
ousel. Olson is a gifted physical 
comedian, but once again she’s 
relegated to being the punching 
bag of the gang. Tally number 
three: Dee is sad, drunk and dis-
gusting. We know.

“Boggs” also revisits “Sunny” 

’s favorite trope of the gang being 
terrible to innocent people (cue 
tally number four). Some per-
mutations of this can be hilari-
ous, especially when the victims 
deserve to be treated like gar-
bage. But this episode went too 
far by putting someone’s life 
in danger. The gang are sup-
posed to be guiltless sociopaths, 
but it’s just not believable that 
Frank (Danny DeVito, “Batman 
Returns”) would nearly kill a 
poor frat boy who has the stones 
to order a beer from the plane’s 
precious, limited store. After 
spiking the kid’s drink with 
a dozen sleeping pills, Frank 
impersonates a doctor and bum-
bles around the young man as he 
babbles incoherently. Tally five 
for jumping the shark, edging 

past hilarious and straight into 
cringe territory.

But the episode’s strongest 

thread is that it offers more time 
to spend with Dennis Reyn-
olds (Glenn Howerton, “Coffee 
Town”). Of all the gang, he’s the 
one who seems to have evolved 
the most from the show’s out-
set, transitioning from a typical 
confident asshole to a confident 
asshole who is also a total psy-
chopath. With his cold eyes and 
Hitchcock-villain good looks, 
Howerton knocks this plotline 
out of the park. Dennis is inscru-
table as ever as he makes an 
addendum to the beer challenge. 
He eyes a beautiful, J.Crew-clad, 
desperately sad lady and makes 
it his mission to have sex with 
her on the plane. He somehow 
figures out that she’s married 
and unattainable, and instead 
bangs some “desert trash” chick 
in the luggage compartment. 
Why? Because “Dennis is a bas-
tard man” and we’ll probably 
never crack that depraved skull 
and really grasp his sociopa-
thy. Tally six for Dennis being 
creepy and manipulative (not 
that I’m complaining).

At this point, “It’s Always 

Sunny 
in 
Philadelphia” 
has 

cemented its status as premier 
caustic, black-spirited comedy. 
The familiar elements make for 
consistently funny television, 
but at the same time, “Sunny” 
seems to have shelved innova-
tion for easy laughs. After run-
ning the gamut of sitcom tropes, 
from self-reflexive parody to 
bottle episodes to road trips, 
the show has fallen back into its 
comfy seat on the couch, content 
to sip beer and spew the same 
jokes while viewers laugh along 
automatically. “Sunny” is always 
funny, but the gang’s schtick has 
grown stale, and the show tragi-
cally runs the risk of becoming 
the TV equivalent of a flat beer.

Not Jeremy Renner’s 

Golden Globes

GENDER AND MEDIA COLUMN

I

t’s a term. A buzzphrase. A 
slogan to slap on an event 
and vaguely raise money 

towards. Women in Hollywood. 
The simple, 
invaluable 
idea that’s 
the basis for 
this column: 
women must 
be better 
represented 
both behind 
the scenes 
and in front 
of the cam-
era in the media. While hugely 
important, this concept can seem 
sterilized when addressed so 
professionally, so archly. But at 
the 2015 Golden Globe awards 
Sunday, my idol Tina Fey suc-
cinctly established the problem 
Hollywood has with gender in 
two biting sentences: 

“Steve Carell’s ‘Foxcatcher’ 

look took two hours to put on, 
including his hairstyling and 
make-up. Just for comparison, 
it took me three hours today to 
prepare for my role as human 
woman.” 

The 
Beverly 
Hills 
Hilton 

resounded with self-conscious 
laughter, and with it ushered in 
the Women’s Golden Globes. A 
show at times messy, as with Jer-
emy Renner’s bawdy comment on 
JLo’s set of “globes” (not doing 
yourself any favors Renner), but 
at it’s heart a desperately needed 
celebration of the diverse women 
in the room. This was a true testa-
ment to the women of Hollywood, 
beating and real and vividly com-
plex. 

We saw it in Julianne Moore’s 

triumphant win for “Still Alice,” 
her second nomination of the 
night. At 54, Moore sits squarely 
in the working wasteland for 
actresses, no longer a “hot young 
thing” and not yet a Meryl. Her 
success on Sunday alludes to a 
progression 
towards 
positive 

female 
characters, 
developed 

based on their personalities rath-
er than their box-office-ability.

We 
saw 
it 
with 
Patricia 

Arquette, 
Best 
Supporting 

Actress winner for “Boyhood” 
and my mother’s favorite road 
trip discussion topic — “She grew 
up in a cult!” — who did nearly 
the unspeakable for her role. She 

allowed herself to age on camera, 
letting her face soften and body 
change sans surgery or chemicals 
over the 12 years of filming, in the 
way her middle-class single moth-
er character would have. She was 
proud to do so, saying in a New 
York Times interview, “I need 
space to grow and get old and be 
a human being. I don’t want to be 
trapped in your ingénue bubble.” 
It was a rebellious move in an 
industry still controlled mostly 
by its dick, and her win serves to 
acknowledge this bravery.

We saw it too in Tina and Amy’s 

sharp joke about George Clooney’s 
Cecil B. DeMille lifetime achieve-
ment award, and later in Clooney’s 
graceful praise of his wife’s argu-
ably more significant achieve-
ments. 

We saw it in “Transparent” 

showrunner Jill Soloway’s emo-
tional testament to her own trans-
parent, and her public support of 
all trans individuals.

But no one expressed the cli-

mate for women in Hollywood bet-
ter than Maggie Gyllenhaal when 
she accepted her awardfor Best 
Actress in a Miniseries for “The 
Honorable Woman.” With her no-
nonsense pixie cut and younger 
brother (and fellow nominee) look-
ing on proudly in the audience, 
Gyllenhaal stood on that stage and 
for two minutes provided some 
desperately needed clarity. 

“When I look around the room 

at the women who are in here and I 
think about the performances that 
I’ve watched this year, what I see 
actually are women who are some-
times powerful, and sometimes 
not. Sometimes sexy, sometimes 
not. Sometimes honorable, some-
times not. And what I think is new 
is that wealth of roles for actual 
women in television and in film.” 

Finally, FINALLY someone pin-

pointing the importance of nuance 

in women’s representations, the 
value in complexity of character. 
Someone once told me that Mag-
gie Gyllenhaal is the closest thing 
I have to a celebrity doppelgänger, 
and after this speech I’m cling-
ing even harder to that very weak 
comparison. Because her words 
resonated with me (and I hope 
with the audience of that room) 
with their laid-bare honesty and 
frankness, with their inspiration 
and grace. 

These were the Women’s Gold-

en Globes, but not just of the new 
Hollywood “woman” — strong 
and slightly masculine and ball-
busting and, still, always, sexy. No, 
these were the Golden Globes of 
every type of woman and every 
expression of femininity, whether 
in the form of Amy Poehler’s goofy 
grace, Amal Alamuddin’s blazing 
intelligence or Amy Adams’s fum-
bling earnestness. 

Much of this year’s ceremony 

was forgettable, and some of 
it awkwardly offensive, from 
Renner’s comment to Margaret 
Cho’s queasy North Korean cari-
cature. (Sorry Cho, but we didn’t 
need to see that the first time, and 
certainly not the second or third.) 
But it was the Golden Globes that 
gave women a voice, a fact fright-
eningly relevant given the just-
announced Oscar nominations. 
All day Thursday my newsfeed 
was whirring in outrage towards 
the 2015 Academy Awards: no 
women 
were 
nominated 
for 

any directing or screenwrit-
ing awards, nor were there any 
people of color in any of the four 
acting categories. Even frontrun-
ners in their respective catego-
ries Ava DuVernay (“Selma”) and 
Gillian Flynn (“Gone Girl”) were 
shut out. Yes, it’s a problem. Real-
ly it’s the problem; representation 
will never ever ever be equitable 
until the people making films 
and the people giving out awards 
better represent the population. 
But this very outrage reflects the 
important self-awareness we saw 
at the Golden Globes. It’s the first 
step in a twisted 12 Steps pro-
gram for an antiquated industry; 
first you have to recognize you 
have a problem before you can 
solve it. Well, it’s clear Holly-
wood is beginning to recognize. 
I can’t wait to see what they con-
tinue to do about it.

Generic ‘Wisdoms’ 

By CAROLYN DARR

Daily Arts Writer

In its most guarded heart of 

hearts, 
Christopher 
Scotton’s 

debut novel “The Secret Wisdom 
of the Earth” is 
about the det-
rimental 
effect 

of kept secrets 
and their ability 
to destroy those 
around 
them. 

Its protagonist, 
14-year-old 
Kevin 
Gillooly, 

learns 
about 

the 
complexi-

ties of love and 
the vastness of 
nature one fateful summer in the 
Appalachian mountains.

The novel begins with Kevin 

and his mother moving back to the 
family homestead headed by patri-
arch “Pop” in the wake of the hor-
rific death of his younger brother. 
Reduced to a husk of her former 
self, his mother is practically non-
verbal, leaving Kevin to deal with 
his perceived responsibility for the 
tragedy. 

Kevin is quickly drawn into the 

politics of Medgar, a small town in 
Kentucky. Historically a coal town, 
its veins have dried up and a new 
form of mining called mountaintop 

removal has begun. This practice 
involves completely leveling the 
once proud mountains that defined 
the town and the surrounding 
area. When one of the main pro-
testers and close friends of Kevin’s 
grandfather is brutally murdered, 
an intricate mountain of deceit and 
lies builds up and blasts apart in the 
small town. 

Through his novel, Scotton con-

fronts male love of all different 
kinds. The relationships between 
two men, two childhood friends 
and a grandson and grandfather 
are all examined, shining light on 
the many ways men depend upon 
and cherish each other. Under-
neath the main plot, Scotton also 
inspects the harsh realities of coal 
mining and its detrimental physi-
cal and economic effects on those 
who partake in it. “The Secret 
Wisdom of the Earth” gives a fic-
tional account of the real disparity 
that can be witnessed in forgot-
ten towns across the rural United 
States. A once rich enterprise, coal 
mining has progressively slowed 
down, leaving many families in its 
literal dust.

Above all else, “The Secret Wis-

dom of the Earth” implores read-
ers to cherish the natural world. 
His new friends see Kevin as a city 
boy, with no practical knowledge of 
the earth. Through the help of his 

grandfather and friend Buzzy, he 
learns to interact with and appreci-
ate the natural wonders contained 
in the mountains surrounding the 
small town. He comes to under-
stand why his grandfather will 
never sell the family land and how 
the earth can contain not just soil, 
but living memories. 

Scotton constructs beautiful 

and thoughtful prose that truly 
paints vivid pictures for readers. 
As Kevin traipses through the 
wilderness, readers can picture 
the beautiful landscape he wit-
nesses. Unfortunately, at times, 
the lengthy novel can drag and 
readers are given somewhat 
unnecessary information. While 
Kevin’s work as a veterinary 
assistant helps readers recognize 
his maturation and character 
growth, many may not be inter-
ested in the intricacies of castrat-
ing a bull. 

Additionally, though the focus 

of the novel is on secrets, many 
of these seemingly deep and 
dark mysteries are actually quite 
transparent. By halfway through 
the novel, readers can probably 
guess both the murderer and 
the ultimate ending. That being 
said, “The Secret Wisdom of the 
Earth” does what it sets out to do 
in its examination of love and loss 
in small town Kentucky.

Vance Joy’s album 
one of the year’s best

By CARLY SNIDER

Daily Arts Writer

We all know the idea of a 

soft-spoken 
songwriter 
isn’t 

exactly revolutionary. Despite 
this fact, Vance Joy still 
manages to make waves with 
his debut album Dream Your 
Life Away. That feat alone 
should earn him a spot on the 
imaginary Top 10 Albums of 
2014 list. But the worth of the 
album is much more than just 
a small but positive public 
reaction. Simple in musical 
arrangement and vocals, the 
Ed 
Sheeran-esque 
Aussie 

offers 
something 
inherently 

relatable and engaging. Joy 
jumps off the sounds and 
themes of his 2013 EP in Dream 
Your Life Away, giving listeners 
exactly what they would expect 
in the best way possible.

The force behind Joy’s debut 

comes largely from the single 
“Riptide,” which immediately 
gave listeners a clear look at his 
honest sound. The infectious 
track launched him into the 
public eye, pulling him into an 
extensive tour as he produced 
his EP, even playing a free show 
in Ann Arbor last summer. 
Coming from a place of not 
being able to show his face on 
his EP cover to playing gigs 
like Lollapalooza, the singer’s 
newfound 
confidence 
and 

identity as an artist is evident in 
his debut. Joy is now scheduled 
to open for Taylor Swift on her 

upcoming tour. (Upon hearing 
this 
news, 
I 
immediately 

cranked up 1989 even louder 
to celebrate. It was already 
playing, obviously.) 

Joy’s 
sound 
is 
nothing 

groundbreaking in terms of 
musical 
ingenuity, 
but 
its 

simplicity and warmth should 
be seen as a strength. Joy 
tackles themes of love and 
youth, without sinking into 
the trap of the cliché. His 
lyrics are straightforward – 
confronting the best, and also 
most 
uncertain, 
aspects 
of 

living. He does not shy away 
from or gloss over the not-so-
perfect parts of life. Subject 
matter ranges from separation 
to personal identity to first 
loves, all the while avoiding the 
sappy and overly sentimental 
things. Even the tone of his 
voice, full of vibrato, expresses 
a realness and vulnerability 
that helps to validate the lyrics 
without coming off as cheesy or 
insincere. 

Supporting these lyrics is 

the go-to alternative combo 
of guitar and ukulele. The 
album rises and falls, using 
these instruments to create 
both contemplative and more 
uplifting tracks. These more 
upbeat tracks, such as “Mess 
Is Mine” and “First Time,” 
are 
so 
undeniably 
catchy 

they can tempt even the most 
hardened of hearts to hum 
along. The instrumentals work 
well to compliment the vocals, 
without 
overshadowing 
or 

overcompensating, 
creating 

a very cohesive sound. While 
most songs follow the standard 
pattern of a pop song, Joy keeps 
his distance from the meat 
of the genre in his less than 
perfectly manicured sound. 

While Dream Your Life Away 

is not busting down barriers 
in 
terms 
of 
instrumental 

arrangement 
or 
stylized 

vocals, it does offer audiences 
something relatable to grasp. 
It is a great source of easy 
listening, perfect for car rides 
or hanging out with friends. As 
mushy as this may be, the album 
sounds like summer – which 
may help to warm up your now 
frigid walks to class. The most 
impressive quality of this album 
is not actually musical, but 
rather lies in the youth of Vance 
Joy’s career. Joy has made great 
strides since he started out in 
2013 and is still growing. Not 
many artists find success with a 
breakout single about their fear 
of the dentist and the dark.

‘Archer’ returns 

HBO

Not that kind of girl.

By MATT BARNAUSKAS

Daily Arts Writer

The last season of “Archer” 

went for a game changer, bucking 
the traditional super spy farce in 
exchange 
for 

its cast of char-
acters entering 
the 
criminal 

world 
where 

they 
peddled 

cocaine, 
sold 

firearms 
and 

entered 
the 

“outlaw” coun-
try music busi-
ness. The aptly 
titled “Archer: 
Vice” 
announced 
a 
dramatic 

change in the life of the Adam 
Reed (“Sealab 2021”) created 
series. However, with the sea-
son six premiere, “The Holdout,” 
the show returns to its espionage 
roots. The result is an abruptly 
humorous return as characters 
readjust to the status quo.

Of course things have changed 

drastically for the series’ title 
character (voiced by H. Jon Ben-
jamin, “Bob’s Burgers”) who now 
finds himself the biological father 
of fellow agent Lana Kane’s (Aisha 
Tyler, “Whose Line Is It Anyway”) 
newborn daughter, Abijean. This 
is after Lana, unannounced, used 
Archer’s “goop.” In typical fash-
ion, Archer avoids responsibility 
until he’s called back into action. 

The spy mission of the week 

leaves Archer stranded in Borneo 
where he’s forced to team up with 

a WWII Japanese soldier, Kintaru 
Sato (Togo Igawa, “Memoirs of 
a Geisha”), who has spent years 
ignorant of the end of the war. 
The first confrontation between 
the two is an incredibly well-ani-
mated sequence as the two duel in 
the jungle. The sequence presents 
possibly some of the best anima-
tion the series has seen and speaks 
volumes to how much the show 
has improved technically from its 
initial seasons. 

Reed’s writing remains top-

notch, with the dynamic between 
Archer and Sato being particular-
ly strong, as the duty-bound Sato 
reprimands Archer, “You cannot 
shirk your duty.” “Yes I can I do 
it all the time!” is Archer’s unsur-
prising response. However, the arc 
presents a surprisingly emotional 
turn for the episode as Sato, who 
has missed seeing his own family 
grow up, challenges Archer’s fears 
of parenthood and forces the spy 
to confront his reluctance to grow 
up. The poignant story still brings 
humor with the series’ quotable 
one-liners. Archer tells the jungle 
to “eat a buffet of dicks” and a mix 
of candy and painkillers coined 
“Mike and Vics” — all particular 
standouts.

The episode’s subplot about the 

rest of the cast’s return to their 
spy agency (formerly known as 
ISIS, but changed for obvious 
reasons) provides some self-ref-
erential comedy. The renovation 
of the agency’s office by Cheryl 
(Judy Greer, “Married”) and Pam 
(Amber Nash, “Frisky Dingo”) is 

incredibly clever as they reveal 
the great lengths they’ve taken to 
return everything to the original 
before the office was destroyed, 
all the way down to the bloodstain 
on the carpet. Mallory Archer’s 
(Jessica Walter, “Arrested Devel-
opment”) despair after seeing the 
hologram of a futuristic office fade 
away to Cold War-era technology 
and Cheryl’s glee at her expense 
are fantastic. The drastic return to 
normalcy seems like Reed laugh-
ing at critics who initially called 
for change and reacted poorly to 
“Vice.” 

Characters themselves have 

physically returned to normal-
cy: Pam addresses the return of 
her weight after slimming down 
due to a cocaine addiction, as 
filling a hole in her life saying, 
“Some people fill it with drugs. 
Some fill it with work. Some fill 
it with between meal snacks, 
liquor 
and 
their 
therapist’s 

cock.” But it still remains uncer-
tain whether Krieger (Lucky 
Yates, “Frisky Dingo”) is or isn’t 
a clone from last season’s finale.

“I’m not a huge fan of 

change,” Archer declares at the 
end of the episode. “Archer” 
may be returning to well-worn 
territory but its humor remains 
as sharp as ever with its strong 
sense of self-awareness. Mean-
while, there is enough chance 
for 
development 
that 
some 

characters of “Archer” will have 
to face their shifting circum-
stances, making this return a 
welcome one.

WHAT’S NEW ON

‘Girls’ brings back 
lovable dysfunction

By CATHERINE SULPIZIO

Senior Arts Editor

Much of early “Girls” ’s ter-

rain was traversing through its 
characters’ most cringe-worthy 
stages 
— 

those chunks 
of 
life 
you 

mentally 
block out and 
wonder how 
you had any 
friends. If you 
experience 
vicarious 
embarrass-
ment, the first 
three seasons of HBO’s polar-
izing show were not for you. 
Between Hannah’s (Lena Dun-
ham, “Tiny Furniture”) rape 
joke (at an interview, no less), 
Shoshanna’s (Zosia Mamet,

 “Mad Men”) bevy of bad 

haircuts and Marnie’s (Allison 
Williams, “Peter Pan”) graceless 
career swan dive, Jessa (Jemima 
Kirke) was the only girl left un-
shredded by the camera’s merci-
less gaze (which had a lot to do 
with her lack of storyline). But 
somewhere in early-mid season 
three, the show pivoted a few 
degrees: Hannah got a respect-
able job that didn’t involve doing 
coke for bylines, Shosh experi-
enced heartbreak and Marnie’s 
lifetime purchase of “pretty girl 
privilege” finally started seeing 
a return, but now with a dose of 
real person struggle. The girls 
grew up, and so did the show — 
richening as the always-excel-
lent comedy widened its genre’s 
grooves. 

But the first episode of sea-

son four’s modus operandi is to 
show that the more you change, 
the more things stay the same. 
It opens with Hannah and her 
parents at the same restaurant 
the series pilot opened on, and, 
against all odds, Hannah is 
moving closer to being “a voice 
of her generation.” 

Part of the reason “Girls” 

remains 
such 
an 
addictive 

show to a certain type of viewer 
(including this very writer) is 
that it replicates and exacer-
bates the necessary hardships 
of being a young adult: sure, 
you have a better sense of who 
you want to be than you did in 
high school, and probably early 
college, but this newly found 
sense of self collides with the 
real world. Great, you want to 
be a writer? Well, how badly? 
Enough to move to the Midwest, 
and give up the nest of friends 
and co-workers and frenemies 
you’ve spent years building, 
enough to crumple up that 
assemblage of regional-trivia 
that keeps you sane: Which 
subway exit to leave from, what 
time the bodega closes if you run 
out of toilet paper, what time 
your annoying neighbor leaves 
for work so you can avoid him … 
that loosely held-together con-
stellation called your life? And 
it’s during this jarring time that 
you realize that other things — 
the things harder to collect and 
compile, that feel like bodily 
appendages — like long, deep, 
important relationships, aren’t 
always portable, they grind to a 
stop even after you keep moving. 

It’s here where Adam (Adam 

Driver, “Frances Ha”) and Han-
nah’s relationship is achingly 
real to anyone anxious and neu-
rotic and obsessive (hi, writers!) 
who hates to work without a 
plan. Adam, for all his patholo-
gy, doesn’t worry; he glides into 
his acting career with little of 
the self-destroying pathos Han-
nah finds her writing from. So 
we can see the alarm bells going 
off when he says, “With cell 
phones and modern communi-

cation we’re gonna talk, like, 10 
times tomorrow.” I beg to dis-
agree, Adam, but I do predict 
this show will explore just how 
fragile a cradle “cell phones and 
modern communication” are for 
Hannah and Adam’s relation-
ship.

Speaking of fragile (wow, what 

a segue), Marnie’s presence in 
this episode shows how drasti-
cally she has changed over the 
seasons. Sure, Marnie is screw-
ing Desi and exuding the same 
hyper-calculated façade since sea-
son one, but Desi’s tongue (Ebon 
Moss-Bachrach, “The Royal Ten-
nenbaums”) is up her ass and she’s 
unafraid to break down after a 
pack of brats in the SoHo brunch 
spot she’s singing at ruins her per-
formance. This Marnie has been 
beaten down so much, that this 
new vulnerability is etched all 
over her face. 

Where Marnie finds grace from 

her sincerity, Jessa is sinking down 
from her mythic cloud. For most 
of “Girls,” Jessa has been the cool 
girl: even when she is struggling 
with a cocaine addiction, we’re 
noticing how fucking cool her 
rehab wardrobe is and wondering 
why our (hypothetical) benders 
were never with British hotelier 
silver foxes. There has never been 
a single crack in the flawless façade 
that is Jemima Kirke. And, as it 
turns out, it isn’t another depraved 
weekend that cracks her, but a 
steady dose of normalcy, the nine 
to five job. In this episode, Jessa 
doesn’t arrive swathed in a blanket 
of glamour, and damn, is it nice to 
see. I’m looking forward to seeing 
what happens after Beadie (Lou-
ise Lasser, “Mary Hartman, Mary 
Hartman”) leaves for Connecticut 
— while Jessa has instability writ-
ten into her DNA, the writing has 
not aided in giving her a narrative 
direction. It seemed like every 
time the show gave her a chan-
nel (a new job, a husband, rehab) 
it buckled quickly or was tossed 
aside without much analysis.

Shoshanna doesn’t have much 

in this episode except a new bob 
and a perfectly pitched perfor-
mance by her divorced parents 
(Ana Gasteyer, “Saturday Night 
Live” and Anthony Edwards, 
“E.R.”), who are both named Mel 
(doesn’t that explain everything?). 
Regardless, “Girls” has been my 
favorite 20 minutes of 2015. I’m 
not sure if that’s a testament to 
Lena’s brilliance or my lackluster 
year, but I’m just glad to have the 
voice of our generation back again 
this Sunday.

Learning curve 
remains steep for 
Michigan on 1-3-1, 

2-3 zones

By LEV FACHER

Managing Editor

More than halfway through 

its season, the Michigan men’s 
basketball team is still gaining 
a clearer understanding of its 
strengths and weaknesses.

Unfortunately 
for 
the 

Wolverines, 
after 
suffering 

a 71-52 blowout at the hands 
of Ohio State on Tuesday, the 
weaknesses certainly seem to 
outnumber the strengths.

One of the trouble spots 

is 
Michigan’s 
man-to-man 

defense, which has led to 
recent foul trouble for multiple 
Wolverines, including freshman 
forward 
Kameron 
Chatman 

and sophomore guard Derrick 
Walton Jr.

As a result of the foul 

trouble and his team’s lack 
of size, Michigan coach John 
Beilein has been forced to 
turn to alternative defensive 
alignments increasingly often. 
The Wolverines have shown 
off two zone looks in the past 
several games — a 2-3 and a 1-3-1 
— and the formations have seen 
varying degrees of success.

“Their 
2-3 
zone 
wasn’t 

effective,” said Minnesota coach 
Richard Pitino following his 
team’s 62-57 loss to Michigan 
on Saturday. “We got an open 
look on it.”

Michigan’s 1-3-1 look seemed 

slightly more potent, especially 
on plays following timeouts 
and during its late-second half 
comeback, but Pitino attributed 
the Golden Gophers’ frequent 
turnovers and offensive miscues 
to a simple lack of execution, 
not an elevated defensive effort 
from the Wolverines.

“They went all 1-3-1,” Pitino 

said. “I thought we were getting 

some good looks. I thought Joey 
(King) had a couple open looks 
in the corner, (Maurice Walker) 
had an open one he dropped, 
so, you know … you can’t beat 
anybody playing like that.”

Beilein’s take, though, varied 

substantially. In his Wednesday 
appearance on WTKA radio’s 
“The Michigan Insider,” he 
said that the switch to the zone 
formations was an attempt 
to keep his players out of foul 
trouble and to prevent his 
team from gifting the Golden 
Gophers points.

“You can’t just go toe to toe 

sometimes,” Beilein said. “You 
could be at the foul line all day.”

The switch paid immediate 

dividends, as Michigan climbed 
out of a nine-point hole to earn 
its third Big Ten win in four tries 
and keep Minnesota winless in 
the conference. The Wolverines 
outscored the Golden Gophers 
22-8 in the game’s final 11 
minutes.

“It 
wasn’t 
that 
shrewd,” 

Beilein said. “It was out of 
desperation at that point, and it 
certainly worked.”

Many of Michigan’s players, 

as the results have shown, feel 
more comfortable in the 1-3-1 
zone than in the 2-3.

“I really like the 3-zone,” said 

sophomore guard Zak Irvin 
following the Minnesota game. 
“I think that had a big impact on 
the game today. Because once 
we went to that, it seemed to 
rattle them a little bit, and that’s 
when we made our run.”

The Wolverines didn’t just 

use the zone to their advantage 
against the Golden Gophers — 
against Illinois on Dec. 30, they 
used their 1-3-1 look to come 
back from a late-game deficit 
and force overtime, eventually 
coming away with a 73-65 
victory.

Irvin, 
a 
relative 
veteran 

on a team with just three 
upperclassmen, 
might 
be 

comfortable in the 1-3-1. But 
for Michigan’s freshmen, the 
learning curve remains steep.

“It takes a while to learn it,” 

Beilein told WTKA. “It’s just 
difficult for some guys to just 
grasp all the things that you 
have to do, because the angles 
are very different than man-
to-man angles, so you go back 

to your man-to-man tendencies 
and it would kill you.”

Not much could have saved 

the Wolverines on Tuesday. 
The 
19-point 
final 
deficit 

undersold the degree to which 
the Buckeyes dominated, as 
evidenced by their 36 points in 
the paint. And while Michigan’s 
31-percent shooting from the 
field was most harmful on the 
offensive end, it also stopped 
the Wolverines from being able 
to use the zone looks even in 
situations where they might 
have wanted to.

“It 
depends 
on 
the 

personnel,” Beilein said. “It’s 
hard to get into it after you miss 
a shot, it’s easier to get into after 
you make a shot. So you’ve got to 
make shots in order to get into it 
very well.”

The bottom line, according 

to 
Michigan’s 
eighth-year 

coach, is that the Wolverines 
will use zone looks whenever 
their personnel and the game 
situation allow them to.

“It’s not as easy as people 

think,” Beilein said. “We try to 
use it when it’s ready to be used, 
and it takes time.”

Zone defense still developing
Wolverines set 
for last tune-up

By MATTHEW KIPNIS 

Daily Sports Writer

More than eight months 

have passed since the Michigan 
women’s tennis team played 
a match at home. When the 
Wolverines last left the Varsity 
Tennis Center, they looked as 
if they could finally win the Big 
Ten Tournament and make it 
to their fifth straight Sweet 16 
appearance.

Ultimately, though, neither 

goal came to fruition. Michigan 
was ousted by Northwestern in 
the Big Ten Tournament and 
by Southern California in the 
NCAA Tournament last year.

That 
was 
eight 
months 

ago, though, and now the 
16th-ranked Wolverines aren’t 
looking in the rear-view mirror.

“The girls are very excited 

about this weekend, not only 
to get the season started but to 
just be at home,” said Michigan 
coach Ronnie Bernstein. “We 
haven’t been at home at all this 
year, which is unusual.”

After a fall season spent 

entirely on the road with 
tournaments 
in 
California, 

Arizona and New York, the 
Wolverines finally return to 
Ann Arbor on Saturday to 
conclude tournament action at 
the Michigan Invitational.

Michigan 
faces 
tough 

competition 
against 
three 

teams that rank in the top 
40 nationally — No. 23 South 
Carolina, Texas Tech and South 
Florida. All three reached the 
NCAA Tournament last season.

The non-scoring event will 

serve as the Wolverines’ final 
practice before the regular 
season begins next week.

“Every year, I invite teams 

and try to make it as tough as I 
can to start off,” Bernstein said. 
“We need to get started quickly 

with some good competition. 
We don’t know them that well, 
so it is going to be tough.”

The 
Wolverines 
haven’t 

played any of the visiting teams 
since 
January 
2013, 
when 

they defeated the Gamecocks 
to advance to the finals of 
the 
ITA 
National 
Indoor 

Championship.

The trip to the finals was 

aided 
by 
this 
year’s 
team 

leaders, 
despite 
the 
youth. 

Senior Emina Bektas hadn’t 
been named Big Ten Player of 
the Year, senior Sarah Lee had 
57 fewer wins under her belt 
and junior Ronit Yurovsky was 
just getting her footing on the 
collegiate level.

Now, 
along 
with 
senior 

captain Kristen Dodge, the 
three anchor Michigan, with 
No. 18 Bektas, No. 23 Yurovsky 
and No. 38 Lee all ranked in the 
top 40 in the country.

“I can’t really believe the 

season is starting again,” Bektas 
said. “It feels like I just came 
in for my freshman year, but I 
know it is my senior year.”

This match will be the 

first dual match for freshmen 
Kara 
Hall, 
Alex 
Najarian 

and Mira Ruder-Hook, who 
came to Michigan with high 
expectations as the nation’s 
10th-ranked recruiting class, 
highest in the Big Ten. But the 
seniors have proven they can 
help ease the transition for the 
freshmen class, as evidenced by 
Bektas teaming with Najarian 
to win the doubles title at the 
ITA Regionals.

This weekend’s matches will 

be the Wolverines’ last tune-up 
before the five-month season 
begins, and Michigan looks not 
to dwell on the broken streak 
but rather the start of what 
could be a new streak of Sweet 
16 appearances in a few months.

WOMEN’S TENNIS

Red-hot Wolverines take 
on Ohio State after sweep

By ZACH SHAW 

Daily Sports Writer

Red Berenson isn’t buying the 

hype. Not yet, at least.

The Michigan hockey coach 

has guided his team to the 
nation’s third-best record (10-
2) since Nov. 1, and it now sits 
alone alone atop the Big Ten after 
sweeping then-No. 9 Minnesota 
last weekend.

But 
as 
the 
19th-ranked 

Wolverines (4-1 Big Ten, 12-7 
overall) travel to Columbus to 
take on Ohio State (2-3, 7-10-1) 
Friday, Berenson knows that his 
team is only as good as its latest 
practice.

“I 
think 
they 
got 
some 

confidence,” 
Berenson 
said. 

“But I don’t want us to be 
overconfident. We still have to do 
a lot of things better than we did 
last week. We’re in a good place. 
We looked a lot better today than 
we did yesterday, which we’ll 
need for Friday.”

The reason for Berenson’s 

hesitation, 
in 
part, 
is 
that 

Michigan has struggled mightily 
on the road, where it is 1-5. Its 
last four losses have come by a 
combined 18-6.

Michigan 
has 
a 
golden 

opportunity to buck that trend, 
however, against an Ohio State 
team that is a paltry 2-6 at home.

“We’ve got to play better 

than we have on the road,” 
Berenson said. “It’s confidence, 
it’s preparation and then there’s 
a level of mental toughness that 
has to be there. There’s going 
to be guys that have a chance to 
make a difference and they have 
to be ready to do that.

“It might be me on a blocked 

shot, it might be you with an 
opportunity to score or take a 
hit, it might be a second effort 
backcheck, but we have to play 
with that second-effort attitude. 
If we do that, then we’ll give 
ourselves a chance.”

On paper, the Wolverines 

have a clear advantage over the 
Buckeyes. With the nation’s No. 2 
scoring offense, Michigan should 
find the back of the net against 
Ohio State, which has allowed 
16 goals in its last three Big Ten 
games.

The Wolverines are scoring 

5.8 goals per game in conference 
play, including eight goals in 
their previous matchup with 
the Buckeyes and 11 goals in two 

games against a Minnesota team 
that touts eight NHL draftees on 
the blue line.

Still, Berenson would much 

rather see a defensive struggle 
from his team.

“We’ve only played a handful 

of games,” Berenson said of the 
success in conference games. 
“You aren’t going to be able to 
keep that scoring going the rest of 
the way. You might get that when 
everything’s going your way, but 
mostly not. I’m expecting this 
will be a one-goal game.”

A one-goal game would be 

a stark contrast to the teams’ 
previous meeting Dec. 5, in 
which Michigan came back from 
an early deficit to win 8-3. The 
Wolverines were clicking on all 
cylinders then, too, but Berenson 
doesn’t read too much into it.

“It was a game where the puck 

went in for us and the power play 
took over for us,” Berenson said. 
“We scored four power-play 
goals in that game, so that’s not 
something you can count on very 
often.”

Michigan has been among the 

nation’s best the past 10 weeks. 
Now it has an opportunity to take 
its show on the road.

‘M’ takes on No. 4 OSU

After road split last 
weekend, Michigan 

continues tough 
conference stretch

By BEN FIDELMAN

Daily Sports Writer

After splitting the first two 

matches of a grueling Big Ten 
slate, the No. 16 Michigan 
wrestling 
team 
heads 
into 

Sunday’s home-opening dual 
meet against No. 4 Ohio State in 
search of a statement win.

“When you get into the Big 

Ten grind, it’s important that 
you’re prepared weekend-to-
weekend,” said Michigan coach 
Joe McFarland. “This is a big 
dual for us. The Michigan versus 
Ohio State rivalry bodes true in 
all sports. We’re excited to have 
them here in Cliff Keen Arena.”

The Wolverines head in as 

underdogs against the Buckeyes 
(1-1 Big Ten, 5-3 overall), who 
have given Michigan (1-1, 3-2) 
a tough time over the last three 
years, winning handily twice.

Although both teams have 

played 
challenging 
non-

conference 
schedules, 
Ohio 

State has taken on three of the 
top five teams in the nation 
in the last month. That swing 
featured losses to No. 1 Iowa 
and No. 3 Missouri, along with a 
win over No. 5 Penn State.

Somewhat of an oddity for 

the Wolverines is that they face 

their toughest rivals on back-
to-back weekends, competing 
against Michigan State last 
Sunday and this week hosting 
the Buckeyes.

“It’s very important to keep 

the momentum going,” said 
sophomore heavyweight Adam 
Coon. “We’re on a good roll here 
with that close dual against 
Minnesota and a good turnout 
at Michigan State. We’re just 
going to keep trying to ride the 
roller coaster up, and having 
a rivalry match is, of course, 
going to add a little more hype 
to the dual.”

Michigan is looking to turn 

heads in the nation’s best 
wrestling conference for the 
second consecutive season. The 
team lost by 
a single point 
against 
No. 

2 
Minnesota 

on 
Jan. 
9, 

broadcasting 
to other teams 
toward 
the 

top 
of 
the 

conference 
that a match 
against 
this 

Wolverine squad isn’t another 
win to check off on the 
schedule.

Michigan 
feels 
the 

importance of preparing with 
a sense of urgency for these 
Big Ten duals. To do this, the 
team decided to hold simulation 
matches 
— 
essentially 
an 

intra-squad scrimmage — on 
the competition mats at Cliff 

Keen Arena for Wednesday’s 
practice. Usually all practices 
are held at the Bahna Wrestling 
Center, which is about a mile 
down State Street.

“It’s a different atmosphere,” 

McFarland said. “I was telling 
the guys in the locker room to 
take advantage of this, and try 
to visualize and get ready for 
Ohio State. I told them to give 
the kind of intensity you want 
in your warm-ups and matches. 
We haven’t done this in a few 
years, so it’s a good change of 
pace for the guys.”

Not only was there a different 

location for the practice, but 
the competition surface was 
new, too. With Sunday’s dual 
being the first home event of the 

year for the 
Wolverines, 
it will be the 
first time their 
new mats have 
been 
used. 

New mats can 
have 
much 

more 
spring 

than 
older 

ones, so both 
the 
coaches 

and players thought it would be 
a good idea to roll them out for 
practice once during the week 
so they could get a feel for the 
surface.

While the Wolverines are 

going out with the old and in 
with the new mats, they will 
still be bringing an old familiar 
sight: a sold-out Cliff Keen 
Arena, after an 11-month hiatus.

One step at a time for Ferlic

Redshirt junior 
heads into third 
season running 

steeplechase

By MATTHEW KIPNIS

Daily Sports Writer

Wisconsin runner Alex Brill 

was struggling with one lap to 
go as Michigan’s Mason Ferlic 
closed in. Feeling energized 
by his teammates’ cheers from 
the background, Ferlic found 
himself in contention to win 
the 2013 Big Ten Outdoor 
Championships 
in 
just 
his 

second-career steeplechase.

Ferlic had jumped over his 

27th barrier of the race, with 
just the water pit and one more 
hurdle to go. Ferlic was in awe 
that he was moments away from 
winning his first championship 
title. But with 300 meters left, 
Brill slid out over the water pit, 
taking Ferlic down.

Ferlic lost his balance and 

with it, the chance of victory.

“All I remember is hitting the 

ground,” Ferlic said. “It was a 
great ‘what if?’ If I hadn’t fallen, 
I could have won. It bothered me 
in the fact that it was a missed 
opportunity to possibly win a 
championship and obviously 
score points for the team.”

Ferlic recovered from his fall, 

and finished the race in fourth 
place. He was just a redshirt 
freshman, but he had already 
come so far.

Even today, Ferlic has trouble 

comprehending how fast he 
has progressed. Before he even 
knew the ins and outs of the 
steeplechase, he was thrust 
onto the national level.

The fall into the water pit 

wasn’t a setback, but rather 
another step along the journey 
for Ferlic, who continues to 
fight even when he gets knocked 
down.

* * *

For 
Ferlic, 

running 
has 

always 
been 

about 
taking 

one 
step 
at 

a 
time 
— 

setting 
goals 

to 
overcome 

the 
current 

hurdles ahead 
of him.

Most 

runners begin their career at a 
younger age, but Ferlic played 
soccer as a kid and didn’t start 
running until high school. After 
some friends convinced Ferlic 
to go out for the track team his 
freshman year, he realized his 
passion.

His first goal was to simply 

catch up to the competition and 
overcome his inexperience.

“I wasn’t particularly fast or 

a talented runner,” Ferlic said. 
“You wouldn’t pick me out and 
say, ‘Oh, that kid is going to be 
fast at running.’ I guess I wasn’t 
even a great athlete when I was 
young because I was a skinny, 
scrawny rail at that point with 
no muscle, but I enjoyed it.”

Ferlic fell in love with the 

sport’s individual competitive 
nature, and though he started 
after 
most 
runners, 
he 

could 
easily 
overcome 
that 

disadvantage. 
He 
controlled 

his fate each practice and each 
race, which kept him at ease. 
It was up to him in a race and 
during training to get better at 
a sport that is governed by the 
stopwatch and nothing more.

He then started setting loftier 

goals, such as reaching the state 
meet and then winning both the 
1,600-meter race at states then 
to win the 3,200-meter race 
along the way.

“I don’t know if there is one 

thing that stands out about him 
when you first look at him,” said 
Michigan cross country coach 
Kevin Sullivan. “But I think 
once you get to know Mason, 
then you see he has a very strong 
inner drive and competitiveness 
that not a lot of athletes have. 
The way he approaches it 
mentally sets him apart from 
a lot of his competition. He is 
someone that, unless everything 
is 100 percent perfect, then it’s 
not satisfying.”

Sophomore 
Ben 
Flanagan 

added: “He is very driven and 
well aware that success doesn’t 

come easy. He is willing to put 
in as much as effort as he needs 
to achieve his goals and there is 
no goal that he doesn’t think he 
can achieve.”

Ferlic ended up using his 

inexperience to his advantage. 
Rather 
than 
holding 
him 

back, it motivated him to work 
harder and not be satisfied with 
catching up to the pack.

Instead, he led it.

* * *

Then 
came 
Ferlic’s 
next 

step: college track. In addition 
to an academic and social 
change, the move to Ann Arbor 
eventually became Ferlic’s first 

true 
running 

challenge.

“Freshman 

year 
cross 

country went 
probably 
as 
poorly 

as 
it 
could 

possibly 
go 

for a freshman 
season,” Ferlic 
said. “I had 
quite 
a 
few 

ups and downs in college, much 
more than high school. At that 
point, you are just a high school 
runner versus guys that are 
college runners, and there is 
a huge gap. That was kind of a 
tough pill to swallow.”

Ferlic was determined not 

to let that stop him, and as he 
watched older runners, notably 
then-senior Craig Forys, he 
learned how to remain calm 
yet confident before a race. As 
he continued to learn from the 
best, his desire to follow in their 
footsteps grew even larger.

Then, during his sophomore 

year, Ferlic broke his foot 
and 
was 
diagnosed 
with 

mononucleosis and anemia.

“It was kind of a rough first 

two years,” Ferlic said. “It was 
tough because at that point I 
had found my ground, training 
was clicking and things were 
coming together. To be sidelined 
again was disappointing.”

Through 
that 
hardship, 

though, 
he 
found 
the 

steeplechase. After Ferlic put up 
practice times on the border of 
reaching the regional meet for 
the 5K while recovering, former 
cross country coach Alex Gibby 
wanted to give him a chance 
at the steeplechase during the 
outdoor portion of his redshirt 
freshman season. Now, he had 
to run five fewer laps, jump over 
four hurdles and leap across a 
water pit.

It was just an idea at first, 

something for him to try while 
recovering. But when he ran 
the steeplechase for the first 
time in the Toledo Invitational 
and finished first, he found his 
newest calling.

“I never considered myself 

a steeplechaser for the first 
year,” Ferlic said. “It was kind 
of that side event that I tried 
out instead of the 5K, but I have 
certainly fallen in love with it.”

* * *

And after he had taken that 

stumble going into the last leg 
of the Big Ten Championships, 
the 
success 
came 
rushing 

in. He finished fourth in the 
3,000-meter steeplechase at the 
2013 NCAA East Preliminary 
Rounds, 
qualifying 
for 
the 

NCAA 
Championships 
but 

failing to reach the finals. He 
finished 13th that year, earning 
All-America 
second-team 

honors.

As a redshirt 

sophomore, 
Ferlic was ready 
to 
take 
the 

next step and 
make the 2014 
NCAA Outdoor 
Championships. 
But 
one 
race 

stood 
in 
his 

way, 
the 
one 

race in which he 
had taken his first fall on the big 
stage.

During the 2014 Big Ten 

Outdoor 
Championships 
it 

happened again. Ferlic clipped 
the second barrier and fell. In 
this race, though, he had time 

to rebound, remembering the 
pain he felt the year before. He 
finished the race in third place, 
improving 
on 
the 
previous 

season’s time by more than four 
seconds.

He then was ready to take 

on the NCAA Finals, which he 
had missed by half a second the 
previous year. Not forgetting 
his mistakes, instead embracing 
them, Ferlic qualified for the 
2014 NCAA Championships and 
finished fourth to earn his first 
All-American first-team honors 
in track.

“He has made really good 

strides in the last three years 
progressing through the ranks 
of the NCAA,” Sullivan said. 
“For him, as long as he stays 
injury-free over the next year 
and he is able to consistently 
train, I don’t see a reason why 
he can’t take a step up next 
year.”

It was then that Ferlic took 

what he had learned on the 
national stage and carried that 
success 
into 
cross 
country, 

improving from 22nd in the 
NCAA 
Championship 
his 

redshirt sophomore year to 13th 
place this past fall. Ferlic also 
led the Wolverines in all six 
events, carrying Michigan to an 
11th-place finish at the NCAA 
Championships — its highest 
finish in 12 years.

“The fact that we came out 

of cross-country season with 
him having his best finish ever 
is going to build a lot of natural 
confidence as we go into the 
indoor and outdoor season,” 
Sullivan said.

* * *

Even with all his success in 

the steeplechase, Ferlic doesn’t 
tell people he runs that event, 
because hardly anyone knows 
what it is. He understands that 
as he runs down State Street, 
people won’t be shouting his 
name. Most don’t even know 
who he is, but that doesn’t 
bother him.

It’s 
about 
the 
personal 

satisfaction 
and 
trying 
to 

improve upon his goals and help 
the team. It’s about improving 
where he is as a runner and 
showing the young runners that 
even if you have a beginning like 
he did, you can still end up at the 
top.

“Firstly, I look up to him to 

try to achieve the same results 
he has, and secondly to be the 
type of runner he is,” Flanagan 
said. “It is something I would 
like to see in myself one day.”

This season Ferlic hopes to 

carry his cross country success 
into this track season as he 
attempts to surpass his fourth-
place finish a year ago.

He is humble, knowing that 

he 
owes 

where he is 
to the hard 
work that he 
has put in to 
get over each 
adversity. 
Each 
year 

he has taken 
that 
next 

step, 
even 

with a few 
falls 
along 

the way.

At this point, the worst thing 

that could happen is falling 
down. But even if he is face-first 
in a water pit, it won’t matter.

Mason Ferlic will get back up. 

He’s done it before.

Michigan looks 
to halt road woes

Wolverines seeking 

first road win at 

Northwestern after 

historic victory

By JACOB GASE 

Daily Sports Writer

In its last three games at 

Crisler Center, the Michigan 
women’s basketball team has 
knocked off three traditional 
conference powerhouses: Penn 
State, Michigan State and Ohio 
State. It’s not just the first time 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico has beaten all three in one 
season — it’s the first time the 
Wolverines have done it since 
the 2000-01 season.

But 
despite 
its 
recent 

accomplishments, 
Michigan’s 

success this season remains 
largely confined to Ann Arbor. 
The Wolverines (3-2 Big Ten, 
11-5 overall) have just two wins 
away from home, and both 
occurred at a neutral site in the 
San Juan Shootout. In its four 
true road games this season 
— including Big Ten contests 
against Wisconsin and No. 24 
Rutgers — Michigan is winless.

Saturday, 
the 
Wolverines 

head to Evanston looking to 
end their road skid against 
a 
Northwestern 
team 
that 

is undefeated at home. The 
Wildcats 
(3-2, 
13-3) 
have 

already beaten Michigan State 
twice, and their only losses of 
the season came in tough road 
matchups at Ohio State and No. 
22 Iowa.

“They’re 
playing 

exceptionally 
well,” 
Barnes 

Arico 
told 
WTKA 
Radio 

on Tuesday. “They have all 
returning starters, and they’re 
playing at a 
really, 
really 

high 
level. 

That 
will 

be 
a 
huge 

challenge for 
us, especially 
on the road.”

Like 
the 

Wolverines, 
Northwestern 
has succeeded 
primarily 
because of a 
balanced scoring attack. Led 
by forward Nia Coffey’s 15.4 
points per game, the Wildcats 
have four starters averaging 
double 
digits. 
Northwestern 

also boasts a talented 3-point 
shooter in guard Maggie Lyon, 
who is shooting 45.2 percent on 
93 attempts from beyond the arc 
and has led her team in scoring 
during conference games.

But Michigan has had nearly 

a full week to prepare for the 
Wildcats. With no weekday 
game following the victory over 
the Buckeyes on Sunday, the 

Wolverines have used the time 
off to rest and rejuvenate before 
the road test ahead.

“It gives our kids a chance 

to get a great day off,” Barnes 
Arico said. “They come in 
and get treatment, they get 
massages, they get taken care of 
by our trainer and really work 
on their recovery. They played a 
lot of minutes in a super physical 
game (against Ohio State). We 
make sure they’re resting their 
legs, getting some treatment 
on their legs after playing an 
overtime game like that.”

The extra practice time has 

also given Michigan a chance 
to focus on its own game 
before jumping into scouting 
Northwestern. Earlier in the 
week, the players divided up to 
watch film with their respective 
position coaches, trying to work 
out the kinks in their individual 
games before worrying about 
opponents.

The Wolverines hope their 

extra preparation and fresh 
legs will help them avoid falling 
into early holes like they have 
in their previous road games. 
In each of its four road losses, 
Michigan has fallen behind 
early 
and 
been 
unable 
to 

recover. Against Wisconsin and 
Rutgers, the Wolverines were 
able to erase enormous deficits 
with second-half spurts, but 
they still ultimately suffered 
double-digit losses.

But trailing by six points with 

4:16 remaining against Ohio 
State, Michigan showed it does 
have the capability to finish off 
a comeback. On the strength of 
senior guard Shannon Smith’s 
36-point performance (24 of 
which came in the second half 
and overtime), a pair of clutch 
3-pointers 
from 
freshman 

guard Katelynn Flaherty and 

an astonishing 
12 
offensive 

rebounds 
from 
senior 

forward 
Cyesha 
Goree (19 in 
total), 
the 

Wolverines 
eked 
out 
a 

hard-fought 
100-94 
victory.

“The 

confidence they had, the drive, 
the passion, the refuse-to-lose 
attitude — it was incredible,” 
Barnes Arico said. “It was a 
special day for our program, for 
sure.”

Ideally, Michigan will want 

to emulate the strong first-half 
defense it has showed the past 
three home games rather than 
allowing more early scoring 
runs. But if the Wolverines slip 
up and still have a chance at a 
late-game comeback against the 
Wildcats, Barnes Arico knows 
she has the players to pull it off.

RITA MORRIS/Daily

Kim Barnes Arico’s team is 0-4 on the road this season and faces another 
tough test Saturday night in Evanston against Northwestern.

“(Sunday) was a 
special day for 
our program, 

for sure.”

ALLISON FARRAND/Daily

Mason Ferlic is coming off a fourth-place finish nationally in the steeplechase.

“The way he 
approaches it 
mentally sets 
him apart.”

“It was a great 
‘what if?’ If I 
hadn’t fallen, I 

could have won.”
