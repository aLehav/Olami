Federal law requires
professors to
release book lists at
registration time
By JENNIFER DOMINGUE
Daily StaffReporter
With the start of a new semes-
ter, many students have been
racking up expensive bills from
buying textbooks. But a new fed-
eral law recently took effect that
aims to alleviate this financial
burden.
A recent provision to the
Higher Education Opportunity
Act requires colleges that receive
federal funding to release the
required textbook lists at the
time of class registration. Also,
textbook publishers now have
to release prices and revision
addendums to schoolA and pro-
fessors so prices are more widely
available.
Supporters of the new law,
which went into effect Jul. 1,
2010, say the new provision will
give college students ample time
to search for cheaper textbook
options on websites, use text-
book buy-back programs or rent
books instead of going to a cam-
pus bookstore.

According to a press release
distributed last month by the the
Student Public Interest Research
Group, the new legislation will
provide much-needed help to
students wihen buying textbooks.
Students spend an average of
$900 on textbooks each year,
according to the release.
Despite the new law, some
University students say they
won't be changing their textbook
buying strategies.
But some students, like Engi-
neering junior Paige Beyers, said
they purchase their textbooks
at the bookstores in town just
before school starts and this new
legislation probably won't affect
their textbook-buying practices.
"I spend about $500 or more
per semester for my textbooks
at the bookstore," Beyers said.
"I a wAysgo just before classes
start."
LSA junior Ryan Jackson said
he no longer purchases his text-
books at a bookstore, but rather
rents them from Chegg.com, a
website that rents textbooks to
students at a discounted price.
"I save about $200 now by
renting my textbooks," he said.
Tina Couch, vice president of
public relations for Chegg.com,
wrote in an e-mail statement
that the company is in favor of

At event, Dingell,
Dean, Schauer and
Peters talk Obama
agenda, 2010 races
By BETHANY BIRON
Daily StaffReporter
Former Democratic presiden-
tial candidate Howard Dean and
United States Rep. John Dingell
(D-Mich.) headlined a College

Democrats rally last night aimed
at getting students involved in the
midterm elections.
Special guests at the event
called, "Moving Michigan For-
ward," included U.S. Rep. Mark
Schauer (D-Mich.) and U.S.
Rep. Gary Peters (D-Mich.). The
speakers discussed a variety of
topics, but focused primarily on
the importance of winning Demo-
cratic seats in Congress to contin-
ue supporting President Barack
Obama's policy decisions.
Each speaker was received

with cheers from the crowd of
students and other University
community members, who filled
most of Rackham Auditorium.
Dean, a past Democratic
National Committee chairman
and former Vermont governor,
said Obama stands for the val-
ues that many college students
believe in - equal rights and
opportunities - and added that
if Republicans assume majority
control in Congress, America will
be "starkly different" and regress
to days of intolerance.

"I remember what it was like
to see the dogs loosed on people,
who simply were crossing over
into a different colored neigh-
borhood to vote," Dean said. "I
remember what it was like to see
the police turning fire hoses on
peaceful demonstrators. We are
notgoingback."
Dean said if Democrats truly
want change, they must work not
only toward getting their candi-
dates elected but also to inspire
Democratic sentiment through-

Starting at 3:30 p.m. yesterday,
University President Mary Sue
Coleman visited with students
who stopped by her house for the
annual president's open house,
continuing the event until 6 p.m.,
nearly an hour beyond its sched-
uled end.
"It's always so fun to meet stu-
dents," Coleman said, adding that
she especially enjoyed interact-

ing with seniors and international
students. "Ijust appreciate the fact
that students take advantage and
come over to talk to me."
"I just wish I had more time to
talk to everybody," she continued.
"It's really inspiring to see (the
students). I always come away

Series of events add
to typical Welcome
Week activities
By VERONICA MENALDI
Daily StaffReporter
New and returning students
were welcomed to campus last
week with traditional Welcome
Week events like New Student
Convocation, the first football
game in Michigan Stadium, block

parties and of course, free food.
But some campus groups are
using the start of the semester to
bring members of various com-
munities together and introduce
students to less traveled areas of
campus.
This week marks the start of
Black Welcome Week, an event
organized by the Black Student
Union, which features a mix of
academic and social events. LSA
junior Chatoris Jones, treasurer
of BSU, said the aim of the event
is to "bring unity" to the commu-

nity.
"We want all the incoming
freshmen to get to know one
another," Jones said.
The week's events include a
drive-in movie, a girls' and guys'
game night and general health
talks. Also on the agenda is a
pre-professional day in which
researchers and different organi-
zations on campus come together
to speak to new students about
getting involved.

FABULOUS FLAMINGO FUN

Leim Irish Dance

Leim, the Gaelic word
for leap, defines the type of
dance practiced in the Leim
Irish Dance club: a combina-
tion of high-energy leaps and
lifts.
But for club member
Andrew Berry, an LSAsenior,
it took a little longer than
most to get his feet off the
ground.
"I could only do the
Macarena and Cotton-Eyed
Joe (dances)," Berry said
jokingly. "And now I'm the
director."
Since joining the group,
Berry's developed an appre-
ciation for dance. And though
the group combines Irish
themed music and dances
with other types of dance,
Berry said its an appreciation
for all types of dance that ties
the group together.

"We do a variety of things.
We don't stick to just Irish
music. We've had songs that
combine tap and Irish, bal-
let and Irish and hip hop and
Irish," Berry explained.
The unique, non-com-
petitive performance group
formed about 11 years ago,
when a small but ambi-
tious bunch began dancing
around campus, Berry said.
Since then, the group has
grown to 30 members and
performs a couple times
each year across campus.
The group also has had
the opportunity to perform
off campus at cultural fes-
tivals and at other venues,
including the Michigan
Theater on East Liberty
Street.
The most anticipated
showcase of the group's

work is a show put on each
year during winter semes-
ter. Performances include
male and female couple
numbers, which Berry said
tend to be crowd favorites.
"The guys are a little hes-
itant to come out," he admit-
ted.
But Berry hopes to dis-
miss prospective male and
female dancers' intimida-
tion by establishing an envi-
ronment in which dancers
with any level of experience
are welcomed, adding that
he's "improved tremendous-
ly" since joiningthe group.
"Dancing's also helped
me in a lot of other things,"
he said. "Before college I
was an athlete...I use my
muscles now in different
ways."

Iran offers little hope
in punishment of
woman found guilty
of adultury
BRUSSELS (AP) - European
Union nations and the continent's
biggest human rights organization
slammed Iran on Wednesday for
its plan to stone a woman convict-
ed of adultery, while Iran's ambas-
sador to the Vatican said there
is "hope" the punishment could
be eased upon review by Iranian
authorities.
The plight of Sakineh Moham-
madi Ashtiani, a 43-year-old
mother of two, has cast a harsh
light on Iran's version of Islamic
justice and caused a global outcry.
Iran says it has put the stoning on
hold for now but has also indicated
Ashtiani could be hanged for her
conviction of playing a role in her
husband's 2005 murder.
In an interview broadcast on
Italian state TV Wednesday, Teh-
ran's envoy to the Holy See gave
the strongest indication yet that
Iran may set aside the death pen-
alty - or at least the stoning - in
Ashtiani's case.
He, was asked what response
he could give to the many appeals
from around the world to stop the
stoning, including concern from
the Vatican.
Ambassador Ali Akbar Nas-
eri stressed that Islamic law was
"inspired by clemency and forgive-
ness." Asked if that meant there
was some hope Ashtiani could
receive clemency, he replied that
"one hopes for some easing of the
punishment."
But he insisted that Iranian
judicial authorities were "fully
independent" and would not be
swayed by "threats."
Ashtiani "after having had illic-
it relations with numerous men,
killed, in a savage way, her hus-
band, with the complicity of one of
these" men, the ambassador said.
"Her guilt has been demon-
strated, but the judicial authori-

ties, before issuing the definitive
sentence, are re-examining the
case with utmost care and atten-
tion, and one hopes for an easing
of the punishment," he said with
a slight smile and without elabo-
rating.
His comments also appeared to
be a positive response to the Vati-
can's hint that it would try behind-
the-scenes diplomacy to spare
Ashtiani's life.
The European Union Par-
liament in Strasbourg, France,
passed a resolution Wednesday
condemning Tehran, a move that
comes on the heels of EU Com-
mission President Jose Manuel
Barroso calling stoning "barbaric."
The vote passed by a huge 658-to-
1 margin with 22 abstentions. The
vote against was an error and was
to be amended in the parliamen-
tary records later.
Sweden summoned Iran's
ambassador to protest the sen-
tence.
"It is important that we are not
passive in a case that - except for
her own destiny - has become
a symbol for the repression in
Iran," Sweden's Foreign Minister
Carl Bildt said. "We are against
the death penalty in all cases, but
stoning is a specifically vile form
of the death penalty."
German Foreign Minister
Guido Westerwelle released a
statement saying he is "deeply
worried for Ms. Ashtiani's life."
"Iran has to respect human
rights, especially because it com-
mitted to do so under interna-
tional law," Westerwelle said. It
is "not a question of religion, but
a question of fundamental human
dignity."
The sentiments were echoed by
the 47-nation Council of Europe,
the continent's biggest human
rights organization. It called on
the Islamic republic's parliamen-
tary speaker, Ali Larijani, to do
his utmost to fully repeal the sen-
tence.
"This inhuman sentence and
the mistreatment that Sakineh
Mohammadi Ashtiani is suffering
cast a tragic shadow on your coun-

try," wrote Mevlut Cavusoglu,
President of the Council's Parlia-
mentary Assembly.
On Iran's state-run Press TV,
Foreign Ministry spokesman
Ramin Mehmanparast repeated
previous statements that plans to
carry out the stoning have been
"stopped" while judiciary offi-
cials also study the punishment
for Ashtiani's conviction of play-
ing on role in her husband's 2005
murder.
Ashtiani's lawyer, Houtan Javid
Kian, told The Associated Press
there has been no change in her
case and the stoning sentence was
suspended but not officially can-
celed. He has said Ashtiani was
never formally put on trial on the
charge of being an accomplice to
murder and was not allowed to
mount a defense.
On Monday, Kian said he had
received word that his client was
lashed 99 times last week in a
separate punishment after Brit-
ish newspaper ran a picture of an
unveiled woman mistakenly iden-
tified as Ashtiani. The newspaper,
the Times of London, apologized
for the error.
There has been no official Ira-
nian confirmation of the new pun-
ishment.
On Sunday, the Vatican raised
the possibility of using its diplo-
matic channels in the case but it
has stopped short of saying such
efforts had begun. Some Western
officials, including Italian Foreign
Minister Franco Frattini, have
said they don't believe Iran will
carry out the stoning following the
international outcry.
But Iran has at times struck
a defiant tone. Even an offer of
asylum from Brazil - which is
on friendly terms with Tehran -
went nowhere.
Mehmanparast accused the
United States and other Western
countries of trying to "exploit" the
case and turn it into a "political
charade."
"Our country has been under a
lot of political pressure by the U.S.
and other Western countries over
its nuclear work," he noted.

SAN FRANCISCO, Calif.
Court won't order
California to defend
Proposition 8
California's highest court has
refused to order Gov. Arnold
Schwarzenegger and Attorney
General Jerry Brown to appeal a
ruling that overturned the state's
gay marriage ban.
The state Supreme Court yes-
terday denied a conservative legal
group's request to force the officials
to defend voter-approved Proposi-
tion 8.
The court did not explain why
it turned down the request by the
. Pacific Justice Institute.
Earlier Wednesday, lawyers for
Brown and Schwarzenegger said
the attorney general and governor
have discretion to choose which
laws they challenge or defend.

DETROIT, Mich.
Illegal power
connections probed
in Detroit fires
DTE Energy Co. says it is inves-
tigating whether illegal electric-
ity connections led to some of the
fires that burned dozens of houses
and garages in pockets of neighbor-
hoods across Detroit.
The Detroit-based utility says
yesterday in a release that energy
theft creates the potential for falling
power lines.
Detroit fire officials says downed
lines may have spawned eight fires
Tuesday afternoon. Two other fires
may have resulted from arson.
DTE says winds and gusts of
up to 50 mph blew trees and limbs
onto power lines, causing outages to
more than 50,000 customers.
The utility says it responded
Tuesday to a report of "flicker-
ing lights, low voltage and poten-
tial energy theft" on Robinwood, a
street heavily damaged by the fires,
and that no downed wire was found.

Army opens high-
speed test track for
war vehicles
The Army has a new test track
* in Maryland to study war-fighting
vehicles operating at high speeds.
An Abrams tank, a Humvee and
other vehicles thundered down the
4.5-mile oval yesterday at Aberdeen
Proving Ground north of Baltimore
during a ceremony.
The Department of Defense says
the oval is the military's first contig-
uous, flat track for sustained high-
speed vehicle testing.
Engineers hope to use the track
to find ways to reduce the number of
motor vehicle accidents, the leading
cause of U.S. military fatalities.
Officials say military convoys
in Iraq and Afghanistan must fre-
quently travel long distances at over
70 mph to counter enemy threats.

But until now, the military has had
no way to test all its vehicles at high
speeds for extended periods.
CARACAS, Venezuela
Chavez accuses foes
* of power sabotage
President Hugo Chavez accused
his political adversaries yesterday
of sabotaging Venezuela's electric-
ity grid as part of a campaign to chip
away at his popularity before legis-
lative elections in two weeks.
Chavez didn't provide any evi-
dence supporting his allegations
about what is behind the country's
troubles with power outages. He
has made similar claims in the past,
also without giving any evidence.
Opposition leaders argue power
outages are the result of the govern-
ment's failed efforts to upgrade the
electricity grid.
Chavez called on federal police
and intelligence agents to arrest
those responsible for the purported
sabotage, saying his government
would "confront and neutralize" the
perpetrators "to guarantee peace
and calm" before the Sept.26 vote.
"We are facing a wave of sabo-
tage, I have no doubt," Chavez said
during a televised speech.
Authorities have not arrested
anyone for sabotaging the grid,
power lines or electricity plants.
Government opponents deny they
are sabotaging the power grid, say-
ing Chavez's administration has not
invested enough in electrical infra-
structure or built enough new power
plants to satisfy growing demand.

Local residents in
uproar over fatal
shooting on Sunday
LOS ANGELES (AP) - Police
mobilized yesterday to avoid more
mayhem on the streets after being
taken by surprise at consecutive
nights of violent protests sparked
by the fatal shooting of a knife-
wielding man.
The police chief, city officials
and consuls general from three
Latin American countries sched-
uled a community meeting as
senior officers tried to reach out to
residents of the central Los Ange-
les neighborhood where the man
was shot.
Sunday's killing of Manuel
Jamines, 37, has turned into a ral-
lying point as community mem-
bers, aided by outsiders, have
taken to the streets for two nights
running and used the death to
highlight past injustices and vent
ongoing frustrations.
Police have defended the kill-
ing and said they've been taken
aback by the level of protest for
what appeared like a clear-cut case
of justifiable use of force. Each
year, the LAPD is involved in up
to about 40 shootings - those that
typically cause controversy involve
unarmed or surrendered suspects.
Residents outraged over the
killing have said police should have
handled the situation differently
and say the surprise by depart-
ment brass shows that the force is
out of touch with the people.
Three bicycle officers were
flagged down Sunday by people
concerned about a man wielding
a knife. The officers approached
the suspect and told him in Span-
ish and English to put down the
weapon.
Instead, Jamines raised the

knife above his head and lunged
at Officer Frank Hernandez, a
13-year veteran of the department,
said Capt. Kris Pitcher, who heads
the Los Angeles Police Depart-
ment's force investigation division.
Hernandez shot Jamines twice
in the head. He died at the scene.
Several witnesses later told police
Jamines had been drinking.
"They could have used pepper
spray or a Taser gun," said Salva-
dor Sanabria, executive director
of nonprofit community group El
Rescate. "The community ... react-
ed this way because they thought
there was another way to deal with
a drunk guy."
Pitcher said Jamines was an
illegal immigrant from Guatemala.
The day laborer was carrying a
switchblade knife with a serrated,
3-inch blade. The police captain
pledged an open and transparent
investigation into the shooting.
The other officers involved
were Steven Rodriguez and Paris
Pineda,both5-year veterans of the
department. All the officers were
Latino and speak Spanish.
Police said the knife was cov-
ered in blood, and DNA tests were
being carried out to determine
whose it was. Officers received
unconfirmed reports Jamines may
have attacked someone before
police arrived, Pitcher said.
The officers involved were
placed on administrative leave, a
standard move after shootings.
An estimated 300 protesters
who gathered outside the local
police station pelted officers Tues-
day night with eggs, rocks and
bottles and set a trash bin on fire.
Others dropped household items
from apartment buildings.
Officers fired atleast two rounds
of foam projectiles at demonstra-
tors and 22 people were arrested,
mainly for failure to disperse and
unlawful assembly.

President Obama
unveils plans to
grow businesses,
infrastructure
CLEVELAND (AP) - Political-
ly weakened but refusing to bend,
President Barack Obama insisted
Wednesday that Bush-era tax cuts
be cut off for the wealthiest Amer-
icans, joining battle with Republi-
cans - and some fellow Democrats
- just two months before bruising
midterm elections.
Singling out House GOP leader
John Boehner in his home state,
Obama delivered a searing attack
on Republicans for advocating
"the same philosophy that led to
this mess in the first place: cut
more taxes for millionaires and cut
more rules for corporations."
Obama rolled out a trio of new
plans to help spur jobygrowth and
invigorate the sluggish national
economic recovery. They would
expand and permanently extend
a research and development tax
credit that lapsed in 2009, allow
businesses to write off 100 percent
of their investments in equipment
and plants through 2011 and pump
$50 billion into highway, rail, air-
port and other infrastructure proj-
ects.
The package was assembled
by the president's economic team
after it became clear that the
recovery was running out of steam.
There was a political component,
too: With Democrats in danger
of losing control of the House in
November, Obama is under heavy
pressure to show voters that he
and his party are ready to do more
to getcthe economy moving and get
millions of jobless Americans back
to work.
However, none of yesterday's
proposals, nor Obama's call for
allowing tax rates to rise for the
wealthiest Americans, seems
likely to be acted on by Congress
before the elections, reflecting the

battering Obama and congressio-
nal Democrats have taken in pub-
lic opinion polls.
Obama made one of his stron-
gest appeals yet to allow the
tax cuts passed under President
George W. Bush - in 2001 and 2003
- to expire at the end of the year
on schedule, but just for individu-
als earning more than $200,000
annually or joint filers earning
over $250,000. The changes would
affect dividend and capital gains
rates and various other tax ben-
efits as well as income from wages
and salaries.
The president's strategy - push-
ing for legislation to save some
tax cuts but not all - carries its
own risks. Since all the tax breaks
would expire automatically at the
end ofthe year if Congress failed to
act, that could result in sweeping
increases for taxpayers at every
income level - a major blow to
recovery hopes and a colossal dose
of blame for voters to parcel cwt to
lawmakers and the White House.
Some influential Democrats,
and Obama's own former budget
director, Peter Orszag, have sug-
gested a compromise might be
necessary - one to temporarily
extend all the tax cuts, perhaps for
a year or two - given the current
election-year animosity between
the two parties.
But in his remarks in Cleveland,
Obama strongly signaled he wasn't
about to sign off on any such deal.
"Let me be clear to Mr. Boehner
and everyone else. We should not
hold middle class tax cuts hostage
any longer," the president said. The
administration "is ready this week
to give tax cuts to every American
making $250,000 or less," he said.
It was a slight misstatement of his
own position, since the $250,000
would apply to household income.
The threshold for individuals
would be $200,000.
White House officials said
Cleveland was picked as the
speech site expressly because
Boehner, who probably would
become House speaker if Repub-

licans take back control of the
chamber in November, laid out his
party's economic agenda here in a
fiery Aug. 24 speech.
At that time, the Ohio Repub-
lican called for Obama to fire key
economic advisers and to support
an extension of all the Bush tax
cuts.
Boehner kept up the attack yes-
terday. "If the president is really
serious about focusing on jobs, a
good start would be taking the
advice of his recently departed
budget director and freezing all
tax rates, coupled with cutting of
federal spending to where it was
before all the bailouts, government
takeovers and 'stimulus' spending
sprees," he said after Obama spoke.
Earlier, Boehner was even more
specific on ABC's "Good Morning
America," saying Congress should
freeze all tax rates for two years
and pare back federal spending to
2008 levels. The deep recession
began in December 2007.
White House press secretary
Robert Gibbs noted that keeping
the Bush tax cuts in effect just for
two more years would represent a
change from past calls by Boeh-
ner to keep them in place perma-
nently.
"My question for him is: Are
they abandoning the permanent
or are they going with the two-
year plan? I've seen him saying
permanent so many times that I
tend to believe that," Gibbs told
reporters aboard Air Force One.
"That's his plan and I think that
continues to be his plan."
Republicans, and some Demo-
crats, argue that the fragile state
of the economy makes this a poor
time to raise taxes on anyone - and
that increases could stifle wealth-
ier people's appetite for spending.
Obama argued that the rich
are more likely to save additional
money than spend it.
And he said the struggling
U.S. economy can't afford to
spend $700 billion to keep lower
tax rates in place for the nation's
highest earners.

Environmental activist tapped
to oversee anti-carp campaign

Obama selects
former official to
stop Asian carp
CHICAGO (AP) - John Goss,
an environmental activist and
former state official from Indi-
ana, was appointed yesterday as
the Obama administration's point
man in the fight to prevent Asian
carp fromgaininga foothold in the
Great Lakes.
Goss will oversee efforts by
federal, state and local agencies
to halt the advance of bighead
and silver carp, which are on the
verge of invading Lake Michigan
through Chicago-area waterways.
Scientists say if the voracious carp
become established in the lakes,
they could damage the food chain
and a $7 billion regional fishing
industry.
Goss has served as executive
director of the National Wild-
life Federation's Indiana affiliate
for four years. Previously, he was
director of the state Department of

Natural Resources and served as
vice chairman of the Great Lakes
Commission, an agency represent-
ing the region's eight states.
Goss "will help to ensure coor-
dination among government
agencies and the most effective
response across all levels of gov-
ernment to this threat," said Nancy
Sutley, head of the White House
Council on Environmental Qual-
ity.
He also will be Sutley's primary
adviser on the carp problem and be
in charge of carrying out a $78.5
million federal effort to control the
carp announced in February. The
plan calls for a series of technolog-
ical and infrastructure upgrades,
such as strengthening an electron-
ic barrier on the man-made water-
way linking Lake Michigan to the
Illinois River.
Critics say the plan lacks clear
goals and timetables and is weak
because it does not endorse clos-
ing navigational locks and gates in
Chicago that could give the carp an
opening to the lake - an issue that
has sharply divided the region.

Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio,
Minnesota and Pennsylvania have
filed a federal lawsuit seeking to
shut down the locks and perma-
nently sever the link between the
Great Lakes and Mississippi River
watersheds. At a hearing on the
case Wednesday in Chicago, a top
official with the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers testified that electri-
cal barriers are the agency's best
defense against the Asian carp, but
aren't perfect.
Gen. John Peabody said metal-
hulled ships can disrupt a small
part of a barrier's electrical field.
Asked by an attorney for the states
whether a fish could get through
the barrier by swimmingclose to a
barge, Peabody said, "It's possible.
We consider itcvery unlikely."
Peabody, who commands the
Great Lakes and Ohio River Divi-
sion of the Corps, said the equip-
ment and barriers needed to
permanently close the locks would
cost millions of dollars that other-
wise could pay for repairs to locks
and dams in such bad shape they
could fail.

Many speculate that
Rahm Emanuel may
enter the race
CHICAGO (AP) - Months of
political jockeying began in ear-
nest yesterday as speculation grew
about who would try to succeed
Mayor Richard M. Daley as leader
of the nation's third-largest city,
including one-time aide and cur-
rent White House chief of staff
Rahm Emanuel.
White House Press Secretary
Robert Gibbs said yesterday he
has "no doubt" that Emanuel will
weigh his future options now that
the race for Chicago mayor is wide
open. Emanuel has made no secret
of wanting to run for Chicago
mayor one day.
"Obviously something like that
doesn't come around a lot," Gibbs
told reporters traveling with the
president to Ohio. "I presume that
Rahm will take some time and
make a decision about that."
For now, Emanuel is focused-on
being President Barack Obama's
chief of staff, and, "the enormous
number of tasks we have in front
of us as an administration," said
Gibbs, who hadn't spoken with
Emanuel about his plans and he
wasn't sure if he'd talked with the
president. Emanuel represented
Chicago in Congress before going
to work for Obama.
Several aldermen are said to be

mulling their chances. And Cook
County Sheriff Tom Dart is con-
sidered a strongcontender.
Then there are U.S. Reps. Jesse
Jackson Jr. - who has considered
face-offs with Daley inthe pastbut
then didn't run - and Lois Gutier-
rez, who could draw support from
the city's substantial Hispanic
population.
Daley, who presided over the
City Council a day after announc-
ing he wouldn't seek a seventh
term, said voters must decide who
they want asthe next mayor, which
he called "the best job in America,"
and that he will not endorse any-
one to replace him.
"It won't be Rich daley to make
that decision," he said.
Aldermen crowded the hall-
ways outside the chamber toassess
who might have the best chance of
succeeding Daley and what kind of
mayor the city will need.
"I don't think we have to have
a strong-arm type of mayor," said
Alderman Sandi Jackson, who has
been named as a possible contend-
er, along with her husband, Jack-
son Jr. "We're in dire economic
times so it would behoove them to
bring everybody to the table and to
find ways to work with everyone."
Alderman Ed Burke, a longtime
Daley rival and influential finance
committee chairman, dodged the
question of whether he would run.
"Oh, we'll have to give that some
thought," he said. "I think right
now the...line is pretty crowded."

Sustained commitment
Michigan should support building the green industry
Traditionally, the Ann Arbor Historic District Commission
has been hesitant to allow any change to the city's historic
landmarks. But saving the environment has increasing-
ly become a more essential component of this city's identity. In
August, the Historic District Commission's approved the instal-
lation of solar panels at the iconic Michigan Theater on State
Street. These types of environmentally-friendly initiatives are a
smart move for Ann Arbor and could lead to good economic news
for the state of Michigan. Students and city residents should
support sustainable projects like this. Other cities in Michigan
and around the country should follow Ann Arbor's example and
encourage similar green initiatives.


Diversity is no laughing matter.

Led by Major John Hieftje, Ann Arbor
has been at the national forefront of the
green movement. Solar panels have pow-
ered the Ann Arbor Farmers Market for
two years. Now, according to a Sept. 6 arti-
cle in The Ann Arbor Chronicle, the Ann
Arbor Historic District Commission has
approved the installation of two solar proj-
ects in the historic district. One is at a pri-
vate home and the other is at the Michigan
Theater. The Michigan Theater project is
being headed up by XSeed, a division of the
Ypsilanti-based Clean Energy Coalition.
By now, most people are aware of the
many benefits of using alternative energies
like solar panels. Converting solar energy
into power allows owners to save on elec-
tricity costs. This can make up for the cost of
installation in only a few years - especially
since installation costs can often be offset by
federal and state tax credits. And depending
less on fossil fuels like coal - which releases
incredible amounts of carbon dioxide into
the atmosphere as it is burns - and non-
renewable resources like oil helps to reduce
humanity's carbon footprint.
And increased use of solar panels could
help to jumpstart businesses In Michigai
by encouraging the growth of the alterna-
tive energy industry. Many Michigan cities
already have the infrastructure to manu-
facture these solar panels. For example,

the old Wixom Ford Plant was retrofitted
by two companies to produce solar panels
and environmentally-friendly storage bat-
teries in September 2009. Putting these old
factories to work constructing new, ener-
gy-efficient products would create desper-
ately-needed jobs - and hopefully draw
even more alternative energy businesses to
Michigan to develop a thriving new indus-
try on which Michigan can depend.
Ann Arbor's commitment to this ideal
is setting a precedent that other commu-
nities should follow. While Ann Arbor has
always put preserving the historic district
at the top of its priority list, deciding to
go green in the district once again proves
how dedicated it is to creating a more envi-
ronmentally-friendly community. Despite
some objections brought up during the
Historic District Commission meetings
about the aesthetic effect of the panels, a
commitment to sustainability won out in
the end - as it should have.
Ann Arbor's commitmentt.,alterna-
tive energy and the successes it has to
show, like the solar-powered Farmers
Market and soon the Michigan Theater,
are encouraging signs for individuals and
businesses looking to join the green move-
ment. The city of trees has again shown its
willingness to move forward and go green.
Now, other cities must follow its lead.

n Aug. 25, University Hous-
ing celebrated the start of the
academic year with its annual
housing kickoff at
Rackham audito-
rium. For the first
time, student staff
- including me
as a resident advi-
sor - were also
invited to attend.
So it's unsurpris-
ing that everyone
would want to start TOMMASO
the year off with an
impressive bang. PAVONE
And so it was
that Dr. Bertice
Berry, a well-
known sociologist, author and moti-
vational speaker who has appeared
on "Oprah" and "The Tonight Show"
with Jay Leno, was invited to deliver
the keynote address. "No one defies
stereotypes, generalizations or cliches
more than Dr. Bertice Berry," read the
day's program, a phrase that's repeated
on Berry's website. The program then
concluded with a big promise: "One
thing's for certain, you will leave dif-
ferent than when you came."
Berry was supposed to "redefine
diversity;" humor, according to the
kickoff program, would help the
audience come together to under-
stand why diversity benefits every
individual. This, along with the two
former promises that she would move
beyond stereotypes and change our
perspectives, makes three promises
that Berry failed to keep.
Ironically, it was Berry's-humorw
that got her into the most trouble. She
digressed, for example, about visit-
ing Korea, and acted out how every
Korean bows down and speaks in a
whisper. Then, all of a sudden, Berry

became rambunctious and loud,
because she had moved to recount
landing in Atlanta, where apparently
everyone behaves that way. Almost
without fail, Berry laughed theatri-
cally at her own jokes, as if her laugh-
ing made it acceptable to guffaw at
anything she said. Sadly, it worked.
After an hour of talking the good
talk about diversity, infusing the rou-
tine with often stereotype-based jokes
and awkwardly breaking into song
three times, Berry had the grace to
take time out of her busy schedule -
she reminded everyone several times
about how she had a flight to catch - to
answer some questions from the audi-
ence. That's when a housing employee
walked up to the microphone.
Before he could start, Berry mused,
"Are you a man or a woman? I can't
tell!" The questioner, Berry had
noticed, had fairly long hair. Some-
what taken aback, he nevertheless pro-
ceeded to ask his question. After Berry
replied with an answer, he mentioned
that he had a follow-up inquiry. "You
know you're ghetto if you ask a follow-
up question," Berry laughed. I am sure
it was a pure coincidence that the man
with the follow-up question was black.
It may come as a surprise to Berry,
but I, a middle-class white Italian
immigrant from the well-off Detroit
suburbs, also ask follow-up questions.
I also doubt that everyone in Korea
whispers and bows and that everyone in
Atlanta is sassy and loud. But then again,
perhaps I shouldn't disagree because, as
Dr. Berry emphasized, she is a scholar
with a Ph.D. I, on the other hand, am
only an undergraduate student.
And yet, for all her supposed aca-
demic claims to fame, Berry's work has
only been cited a handful of times by
fellow academics, as a cursory search
on Google Scholar will reveal. It seems

that fellow sociologists have some res-
ervations regarding Berry's message.
Perhaps it's because it borders more so
on motivational speaking than socio-
logical research. Perhaps it's because
it's full ofthe very stereotypes and gen-
eralizations Berrystates she's tryingto
overcome. Either way, it seems I'm not
the only one who takes issue with some
aspects of Berry's message.
Here's my
"ghetto" follow-up
for Dr. Berry.
Laughter is a powerful thing - it's
one of the most effective forms of peer
pressure. If half of the auditorium is
laughing, you feel compelled to laugh
too. Berry would do well to remem-
ber this point when she considers the
effectiveness of her humor. I, asan
audience member that day, invite my 0
peers to reassess Berry's speech. If we
believe that stereotyping is no laugh-
ing matter, as our training as Housing
employees emphasizes,then our think-
ing shouldn't change just because a
charismatic "diversity expert" likes to
laugh at her own jokes.
To her credit, Berry did provide us
with mind-blowing insights regarding
our roles as Housing employees. When
asked by an audience member about
how resident advisors can help build
inclusive communities, Berry was
uncharacteristically silent. "Keep yotir
door open," she finally responded. Bril-
liant - absolutely brilliant.

The hijab as a statement of faith

Stalking to stay connected

0
0

For those of you unfamiliar with the story
of Imane Boudlal, let me provide some back-
ground information. According to an Aug. 18
Associated Press report, Boudlal is a Muslim
woman who has worked for Disney the last two
years. This year, she decided to wear a hijab -
a type of women's head covering common in
Arab countries - for Ramadan, the Muslim
month of fasting and reflection. Her employer
told her this violated dress code. Boudlal is
insisting that Disney's attitude is anti-Islam
and anti-Arab.
Her employers, however, are part of a vast
entertainment industry known for its strident
dress code policies. Though Boudlal worked as
a hostess in a restaurant, these employees are
treated as performers. Her head covering was
not part of the accepted costume. In theory, yar-
mulkes and crucifixes would also be considered
violations of the dress code. Boudlal was offered
the alternative of working "behind the scenes"
where she would not be seen by customers. She
refused and the lawsuit is pending.
I'm not questioning Disney's right to dictate
the dress of their employees, as long as the cor-
poration rejects all ethnic dress. I also won't
intend to delve into some of the other details,
like the fact that Boudlal asked her boss if she
could wear her hijab and was told that Disney
would design one for her. Disney never pulled
through. However, it is evident that by refusing
to compromise, Boudlal pushed herself into the
spotlight as another so-called deviant, unrea-
sonable Muslim.
Muslims didn't need this publicity. America
doesn't need this publicity. Coming from small-
town Michigan, I've heard plenty of people
express prejudice against Islam. In many cases,
Islam isn't understood on its own terms. Rather,
it's perceived based upon the minority of Mus-
lims who make it onto the news in spectacular
and negative fashion. In fact, the persistent
drama over the "Ground Zero mosque" (which
isn't at Ground Zero, by the way) just highlights
a fact that certain Americans seem to have trou-
ble grasping: not all Muslims are terrorists.
on a smaller scale, even the hijab is vastly
misunderstood. An innocuous status update on
Facebook exploded my notifications as two of
my friends - one a Muslim, the other an atheist
- butted heads not over Boudlal's right to wear

her hijab in the workplace, but over a woman's
right to decide to wear it at all. In America, this
head covering seems strange to many. This
isn't surprising, considering that our culture
has longsince stopped struggling against short
shorts and tights worn with shirts and skimpy
tank tops. An extra garment worn to defend
modesty is an anomaly.
We don't understand the hijab except in
extremist terms - like the defense that the hijab
is a woman's protection against lustful glances
and rape. My atheist friend believes that the
hijab is sexist and anti-feminist in the worst
way because of these prejudices. But my Mus-
lim friend vehemently opposed this view. "It's
not even about religion," she posted in response.
"It's about non-Muslims suppressing these
women by denying thatthey could ever have had
a brain and made this choice on their own."
My Muslim friend didn't wear a hijab on a
daily basis as a student at the University. In
Pakistan, however, she dons one. It's the cul-
tural norm there, she explained to me. And,
yes, there are stares and leers at women who
choose not to wear the hijab. It's considered
a cry for attention - just like wearing tight
pants, revealing shirts and the like is for Amer-
ican girls.
The University prides itself on its diverse stu-
dent body. And I've seen a fair handful of young
women sporting jeans, t-shirts and hijab of all
patterns. These girls are not forced to wear it.
They wouldn't be subject to lustful stares if
they removed it. Instead, they choose to wear it
as a statement of their faith. As an expression of
modesty, it doesn't matter.
The fact is that wearing the hijab in Ameri-
ca is a choice. Denying Muslim women's right
to wear the hijab on well-intentioned but ill-
researched feminist motives is wrong. Some of
these girls would feel naked without their head
covered, just as most other students would feel
a bit exposed if they walked outside without
pants. Choosing to wear their hijab is, whether
they intend it tobe or not, an expression of their
control over their sexuality. In this context, the
hijab is just as feminist an item of clothing as
Susan B. Anthony's bloomers. Perhaps we've
learned enough by now to take it in stride.

magine a scenario in which
you're a single person at a bar
and someone you don't know
comes up and talks
to you. At some
point in the con-
versation, you find
out that this per-
son approached
you because he
or shepulled up
your Facebook
profile on a smart-
phone and saw that JEREMY
you were single.
Sounds creepy, LEVY
right? But who _
knows, maybe I'm
just being pre-
sumptuous. Who's to say that one
couldn't meet a future spouse in such
a situation?
This scenario may happen as a result
of the launch of Facebook's new Places
feature on Aug. 18. If users choose to
use this application, they can log onto
Facebook from a smartphone and
Facebook will broadcast their location.
Users can also track their friends' loca-
tions and pull up the profiles for other
individuals who are broadcasting from
the same location.
As social media expands and
becomes more advanced, it forces us
to reevaluate what we consider to be
socially acceptable behavior. It's often
too easy to assume that these changes
cause people to be less personal and
more isolated. The first time a friend
told me about the bar scenario men-
tioned above, my gut reaction was
that such technology was obtrusive
and unnecessary. I envisioned iPhones
turning into human tracking devices
analogous to the collars they use to
track the wild deer in my neighbor-
hood. However, I quickly came to real-
ize that I was unnecessarily focusing

my attention on the worst possible out-
come of new technology.
Such responses are common when
it comes to technology. Consider a Jul.
16 column in The New York Times
from Bob Herbert entitled, "Tweet
Less, Kiss More." That title succinctly
summarizes his argument. one of
Herbert's examples is an engagement
party in which many of the guests
were sending text messages instead of
paying attention to the toasts. I'm not
convinced cell phones are what cause
people to not pay attention - if there
were no smartphones, the same num-
ber of people still would probably have
been twiddling their thumbs.
The media response to the launch
of Places was similarly critical. Many
news reports on the subject seemed
geared toward concerned parents
rather than those who will actually
be using the feature. Several news-
papers reported on the privacy issues
surrounding Places. The Washington
Post even provides instructions on
how to turn it off.
An argument that resonates
strongly with me is that each tech-
nological change brings positive and
negative effects to our social lives and
it's hard to immediately predict what
these effects will be. In the words of
Slate blogger Farhad Manjoo, "(Plac-
es is) sure to affect your relationships
in amazing and awful ways, most
likely both." By looking at some past
technological changes, one can see
how this statement rings true.
Let's start with Facebook. Face-
book is an easy way to keep tabs on
friends you don't see very often,
share pictures and direct others to
amusing things you find on the Inter-
net. I don't see it as a cop-out way of
socializing. I see it as a way to share
things that I wouldn't always have
time to do otherwise. But there are
WANT THE DAILY ON THE GO?

some strange social consequences.
For instance, it's common to pick up
information on people you aren't very
close with. This can be an uncomfort-
able problem when you come in con-
tact with such people later and don't
know how to react as they tell you
about their life.
Facebook's Places
isn't necessarily
a cyber leash.
We can also look at texting. I was
very skeptical of texting when it first
came out. But there are situations
when texting is more convenient than
calling - if you have to ask the same
question to six different people, or if
you want to know about something
small that doesn't merit a full discus-
sion. Then again, I hate getting into
drawn-out text conversations when
it would make more sense to simply
talk on the phone.
I suspect that Places will have the
same combination of positive and
negative social effects. It might make
it easier for singles to meet in public.
It also might make it more difficult
to casually lie to someone about your
location, which can be useful. What-
ever happens, there will likelybe skep-
tics who see Places as yet another way
technology is causing people to isolate
themselves. But those who always
assume the worst with technology
should really embrace positive changes
- even if it clashes with their idea of
what is socially acceptable.

The Michigan Daily - michigandaily.com

Secs. Clinton, Gates denounce
planned Quran burning in Fla.

Former NBA, 'U'
basketball player
guilty of fraud

Top national security
advisors say burning
could put Americans
at risk overseas
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
top two national security advis-
ers in President Barack Obama's
Cabinet yesterday denounced
plans by a small church in Florida
to burn the Muslim holy book to
commemorate the Sept. 11, 2001,
terrorist attacks, saying it would
inflame tensions and put Ameri-
cans abroad at risk.
Secretary of State Hillary Rod-
ham Clinton and Defense Secre-
tary Robert Gates said the plan was
ill-advised and echoed concerns
first raised by the U.S. commander
in Afghanistan, Gen. David Petrae-
us, who warned that the proposed
weekend event would place the
lives of American troops in jeop-
ardy there and elsewhere. U.S. offi-
cials in Iraq agreed.

Underscoring the administra-
tion's concern about the potential
impact of the Quran burning, the
State Department ordered U.S.
embassies and consulates around
the world to assess their secu-
rity and warn Americans if they
believe anti-American protests
may occur. At least one post, the
U.S. Embassy in Algeria, issued a
security alert yesterday.
In remarks to the Council on
Foreign Relations think tank in
Washington, Clinton called the
plans "outrageous" and "aberra-
tional" and said they do not repre-
sent America or American values
of religious tolerance and inclu-
siveness.
She also lamented that the tiny
Dove World Outreach Center con-
gregation in Gainesville had got-
ten so much attention for what she
called a "distrustful and disgrace-
ful" means of marking the ninth
anniversary of the Sept. 11 terror-
ist attacks.
"It is regrettable that a pastor in
Gainesville, Fla., with a church of

no more than 50 people can make
this outrageous and distrust-
ful, disgraceful plan and get the
world's attention, but that's the
world we live in right now," Clin-
ton said. "It is unfortunate, it is not
who we are."
Through a Pentagon spokes-
man, Col. David Lapan, Gates
added his voice to the growing
controversy.
"No one is questioning the right
to do these things. We are ques-
tioning whether that's advisable
considering the consequences that
could occur," Lapan said. "Gen.
Petraeus has been very vocal and
very public on this, and his position
reflects the secretary's as well."
Petraeus on Tuesday said that
"images of the burning of a Quran
would undoubtedly be used by
extremists in Afghanistan - and
around the world - to inflame pub-
lic opinion and incite violence." In
addition, Gen. Ray Odierno, the
former top commander in Iraq, said
Wednesday he feared extremists
will use the incident to sow hatred

against U.S. troops overseas.
In Iraq, where almost 50,000
American troops are still serving,
U.S. Ambassador to Iraq James
Jeffrey and the commander of U.S.
forces in Iraq, Gen. Lloyd Austin,
joined in the condemnation, call-
ing the plan "disrespectful, divi-
sive and disgraceful."
"As this holy month of Rama-
dan comes to a close and Iraqis
prepare to celebrate Eid al-Fitr, we
join with the citizens of Iraq and
of every nation to repudiate reli-
gious intolerance and to respect
and defend the diversity of faiths
of our fellow man," they said in
a joint statement released by the
U.S. Embassy in Baghdad.
Despite the widespread con-
demnation, church Pastor Terry
Jones has vowed to go ahead with
the event.
Clinton appealed for Jones to
reconsider and cancel. And, in the
event he goes ahead with the plan,
she suggested to laughter from
the audience, that the news media
ignore it.

Jury finds Rumeal
Robinson guilty on
11 counts of fraud
DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -
Rumeal Robinson, who led Michi-
gan to the NCAA men's basketball
championship in 1989 and later
played intheNBA,was convicted in
federal court yesterday of borrow-
ing more than $700,000 for a sham
business deal andthenspendingthe
money on a condominium, expen-
sive furniture and cars.
A jury found Robinson guilty of
11 counts, including bank bribery,
wire fraud, conspiracy to commit
bank fraud and making a false state-
ment to a financial institution. He
faces up to 30 years in prison and a
$1 million fine on each count. A date
for sentencing hasn't been set.
Among a lengthy list of accusa-
tionsby prosecutorswas one accus-
ing Robinson of scheming to sell
his mother's home in Cambridge,
Mass., without her knowledge.
A telephone message left for
Robinson's attorney, J. Keith Rigg
of Des Moines, wasn'timmediately
returned.
Robinson grew up in Cambridge
and was a star at Michigan best
known for sinkingtwo free throws
that helped the Wolverines beat
Seton Hall in the 1989 national title
game. He was drafted 10th overall
by Atlanta in 1990 and went on to
play six seasons in the NBA with
the Hawks, Nets, Hornets, Trail
Blazers, Suns and Lakers.
Federal prosecutors say Robin-
son schemed between 2004 and
2005 to borrow the money from
Community State Bank in the Des
Moines suburb of Ankeny. He had
the help of Brian Williams, a loan
officer at the bank who pleaded
guiltytoconspiracy tocommitbank
fraud before Robinson's trial began.
Prosecutors said Williams

signed off on an initial $377,000
loan to Robinson for his business,
Megaladon Development Inc.,
which was supposedly pursuing
a development deal in Jamaica.
Instead, Robinson bought a condo,
plasma TVs and designer furni-
ture, prosecutors said.
They said Robinson put the
condo in the name of his girlfriend,
listing her as his company's mar-
keting director thoughshe actually
worked in a strip club.
Williams later approved an
$80,000 loan for Robinson, which
was supposed to be used for busi-
ness butagain was spenton person-
al items, includingcars, clothes and
more furniture, prosecutors said.
When Williams' lending author-
ity at the bank ran out, he and Rob-
inson circumvented the $500,000
limit by having the mother-in-law
of Robinson's business partner,
Jorge Rodriguez, sign documents
for a $150,000 loan that was wired
directly to Robinson's company.
Prosecutors said the woman was
told she was signing the documents
to invest in Robinson's company,
buthe spent $44,000 to buy or lease
10 vehicles, including three Mer-
cedes, two BMWs and five motor-
cycles. He also spent $3,000 atstrip
clubs, bought a dog for $1,000 and
spent $28,000 on house-related
payments, prosecutors said.
They said Robinson later
obtained three more loans from
the Ankeny Bank totaling more
than $111,000 in the name of his
girlfriend.
When it became obvious the
Jamaica deal would fail, Robinson
and Williams became involved in
an energy project with a company
called Fairway Energy. Williams
loaned $495,000 to the company
in exchange for a promise of a pay-
ment of that same amount to Wil-
liams. Another $101,000 loan was
made by Williams in connection
with the energy company.


Mexican mayor killed, suspects arrested

Slaying of mayor
was country's third
in less than a month
MEXICO CITY (AP) - Hooded
gunmen killed the mayor of a small
town in the northern Mexico state
of San Luis Potosi yesterday, and
prosecutors announced the arrest
of seven suspects in the massacre
of 72 migrants in August.
President Felipe Calderon's
office issued a statement saying
he "energetically condemned" the
slaying of the mayor of El Naranjo
- the third mayor to be killed in
Mexico in less than a month.
Amid the violence, U.S. Sec-
retary of State Hillary Rodham

Clinton said that Mexico is "look-
ing more and more like Colombia
looked 20 years ago, where the
narco-traffickers control certain
parts of the country, not signifi-
cant parts."
Her comments raised hackles in
Mexico.
"Of course we do not agree with
the statement in this regard, given
that there are very important dif-
ferences between what Colom-
bia faced then and what Mexico
faces today," Mexican government
security spokesman Alejandro
Poire said.
Mexican officials say drug car-
tels are not allied with domestic
rebel insurgencies, do not have
political influence or following
and do not control of large swaths

of the country.
In Colombia in the 1980s and
1990s, the Medellin drug cartel
waged a full frontal assault on the
state, endangering its very integ-
rity. It used bullets and bribes
against police, politicians and
judges and turned to terror attacks
against civilians.
Attacks like yesterday's shoot-
ing death of El Naranjo Mayor
Alexander Lopez Garcia suggest
Mexico's cartels are indeed tar-
geting civilian government, using
both violence and corruption.
The San Luis Potosi state
prosecutors' office said Lopez
Garcia was killed by a squad of
four hitmen who pulled up in a
vehicle.
Two of the attackers burst into

Lopez Garcia's office and killed
him before fleeing. The rural
township of about 20,000 people
borders the violent-wracked state
of Tamaulipas, where 72 migrants
were massacred by drug gunmen
in August.
There was no immediate infor-
mation onthe motive inthe attack,
but the style of the slaying resem-
bles methods used by Mexico's
drug cartels.
Lopez Garciawathethird Mexi-
can mayor slain in the last month.
On Aug. 29, the mayor of a town
just across the state line in Tam-
aulipas was shot to death and his
daughter wounded. The mayor of
Santiago, a town in the neighbor-
ing state of Nuevo Leon, was found
murdered Aug.18.

Howard Dean rallies the crowd gathered at Rackham Auditorium last night, encouraging them to get involved in the midterm elections.
Dean: Dems must win mi terms
for Oba-mt P a to conti nue progress

out the nation and to work tirelessly
to make their desires heard.
"So many Americans think all
we have to do is vote and get our
guy in, or our women in, and then
they're going to do the work and
we're going to go back to whatever
we were doing before," Dean said.
"It doesn't work like that. If you
want your country to work, you
have to work every single day."
Although voters will not be elect-
ing the next U.S. president, Dean
9 said the upcoming elections are
just as pivotal, because President
Obama will need in November's
elections Congressional support to
continue to accomplish policy ini-
tiatives.
"Barack Obama is not on the
ballot this time, but he is in many
ways," Dean said. "He can't get
anything done, unless you send
these guys back to Congress."
Dingell echoed Dean's senti-
ment, encouraging audience mem-
bers to prevent Republicans from
WELCOME
From Page 1A
Week, which has been going on
since the fall of 2002, took place
during the official first week back
to campus. But to avoid competition
with Meijer Madness and other
Welcome Week events, Jones said
they pushed their events one week
later. This scheduling also gives
students the option to stop by the
events after their classes, he said.
Student-athletes this year will
also experience change in their
welcome week reception, which
began on Sept. 7 and will end on
Sept.12.
LSA senior Alex Wood, president
of the University's Student-Athlete
Advisory Council, said student-ath-
letes in previous years attended a
nighttime banquet - the sole event
of past welcome weeks.
"This is the firstyear (for the lon-
ger event), and we really tried to put
together a program from Tuesday
to Sunday to get this year's fresh-
OPEN HOUSE
From Page 1A
because they wanted to talk with
Coleman, others came to see the
inside of the University presi-
dent's house, enjoy refreshments
like cookies and cider or just to kill
time.
But with Coleman grinning,
shaking hands and posing for pic-
tures with students, nearly every-
one left the open house saying they
were happy they came.
LSA freshman Aditi Shetty said
she was happy with the conversa-
tion she had with Coleman, who
she described as "an icon of the
University."
"We talked about her house and
the architecture," Shetty said. "In
hindsight, it was probably a rosly
boring conversation to any outsid-
er, but I thought it was really inter-
esting, because when do you have
the chance to talk to the University
president?"
LSA sophomore Rebecca Guer-
riero said she decided to come to
the open house because her friends
were coming.
"I didn't really know what

to expect. I didn't even know if
we'd get to meet her," she said,
impressed with the event and with
Coleman. "It makes the University
seem like home. You come here and
you see her and it's like, she's just

overturning Obama's work in office
thus far.
"The Republicans have talked
about change, and about taking the
country back," Dingell said, "and
I'mgoingtoask, back to what? Back
to Bush? Back to Hoover? Back to
1900? Back to Louis the 13th?
"We're talking about change
and hope and making America bet-
ter for our people," Dingell added.
"This country is going to move for-
ward whether the Republicans like
it or not. And we're going to drag
them kicking and screaming into
the 21st century."
Schauer also spoke about con-
tinuing to establish Democratic
ideals in order to help families,
through strengthening programs
like Medicare and Social Security.
He said he believes the Democratic
Party tends to focus on the issues
of the many, while the Republicans
are more focused on the issues of
certain individuals.
"It's a question of our values,
what kind of people we are," Schau-
er said. "And the Republican Party
en welcomed into the Michigan
family and give them tips to suc-
cess," Wood said.
Planned welcoming activities
include a senior panel in which
first-year student-athletes are
given the opportunity to ask ques-
tions of senior athletes, networking
tips at the University Career Center
and a screening of "Invictus" dur-
ing a finale event titled "Wolverine
Wow," according to the SAAC.
Wood said the movie screening
- intended for the entire athletic
community - would take place
on the 10-yard line in the recently
re-dedicated Michigan Stadium
and will feature popcorn vendors.
Wood added that the focus on
helping student-athletes make the
college transition partly reflected
the Athletic Department's owns
transition under the new leader-
ship of Athletic Director David
Brandon.
Another welcome week event,
Explorth, aims to "showcase and
highlight North Campus" by offer-
ing the chance for students as well

believes it's every person for them-
selves. And we know we are stron-
ger when we are together."
Peters emphasized the impor-
tance of job creation in a strug-
gling economy as well as protecting
Michigan's resources like the Great
Lakes.
"There isn't anything more
important than jobs," Peters said.
"We've had positive job growth, but
we've got to be focused on more. We
need to be focused on what it's going
to take to keep this economyggoing."
Brendan Campbell, President of
College Democrats, helped orga-
nize the event as an opportunity
for students to hear more from
Democratic legislators in the area
and become inspired to vote and
help the Democratic Party in the
upcoming elections.
"We wanted to make sure stu-
dents were excited and energized
by this election," Campbell said.
"We wanted to get people motivat-
ed to volunteer, motivated to come
out and vote, motivated to help us
elect our candidates in the fall."
as faculty and staff to learn about
and see all that North Campus
has to offer, said Jennifer Wegner,
Student Affairs program manager
for the College of Engineering and
Explorth committee member said.
"It's very active," she said. "We
know the best way to see (North
Campus) is to actually walk around,
go to the buildings you might not
normally go into and learn things
about cool design studios, for
example."
Though various groups on North
Campus hosted the event last year,
this year's version - slated for Sept.
15 - will be bigger with more musi-
cal performances, an open jam ses-
sion and more food.
The event starts on the North
Campus Diag where participants
are given a "passport" highlighting
major visiting points. Once the par-
ticipants see as many spots as they
desire and receive a stamp at each,
they can turn the passport in for a
chance to win a raffle prize.
Students were also welcomed to

people really excited, because I feel
a lot of our generation has kind of
dulled down after the Obama years.
And I think this was a quick burst
of energy that everyone needed."
LSA junior Ronald Cade said
he felt the event was important,
because it inspired students to vote
in an election that he said would
be crucial in allowing Obama to
continue to have an impact on the
nation.
"I think thegovernor'selection is
going to be very important, and the

away from double-stream recy-
cling, which involved separating
recyclables by mixed papers and
mixed containers before plac-
ing them curbside. Now the city
uses a single-stream recycling
system. RecycleBank has taken
advantage of the move, allowing
all recyclables to be placed into a
single cart.
Thomas McMurtrie, the city's
solid waste coordinator, said the
efforts to consolidate recyclables
were part of a larger effort, which
includes the RecycleBank part-
nership, to make recycling more
accessible.
"We're making recycling con-
venient and easy for everyone,"
McMurtrie said.
With this new emphasis on
environmental consciousness,
city officials said they hope to
see recycling rates double or even
triple during the Ann Arbor-
RecycleBank partnership, which
began on Sept. 1 and will last 10
years.
According to a press release
issued by the city, recycling rates
in participating cities Rochester
Hills and Westland are up 241
percent and 458 percent, respec-
tively.
"We have a very robust multi-
family community," said Nancy

Stone, spokeswoman for the city
of Ann Arbor. "Our understand-
ing with RecycleBank is that we
want to work with them to devel-
op a multi-family (housing) pro-
gram and eventually a business
program as well."
Expanding the program to
students in unique housing situa-
tions may bring a new set of chal-
lenges, McMurtrie said, including

legislation will give students
more options, it probably won't
change the way he shops for
textbooks.
"I definitely support the
opportunity to find the best
deals and appreciate it, but I
always end up waiting until the
last minute anyways," said Jack-
son. "Then again, I do think it
is a really good idea and might
utilize it next semester."
Some students also hope that
by forcing textbook publishers
to disclose the prices of their
textbooks to professors, more
instructors will take notice of
how much their course books
cost and try to keep costs down.
"I hope that this new law
will make the professors more
aware of how much all these
books cost, and then make final
decisions based on that," Bey-
ers said. "I feel that if professors,
know that a book costs $200 for
a student, they might not choose
that book for a course."
But Associate History Prof.
Farina Mir said the new legis-
lation won't have much of an
effect on how she chooses books
for her courses.
"I try to keep the cost of my,
textbooks within the range of
$100 to $150," said Mir. "I don't
need to have a publisher tell me
how much the textbooks are. I
look into the prices myself."
Mir said she does try to be
conscious of the total cost of
textbooks when picking them
out.
"Sometimes I do choose a
more expensive book because of
the work the book is doing, but
then I make concessions with
my other additional textbooks,"
Mir said. "After all, if the aver-
age college student takes four
classes a semester, and each
class's textbooks are over $100,
then that is a rather large por-
tion of a college student's educa-
tional expenses."
dealing with high turnover rates
in campus-area housing.
"Our plan is to evaluate the
program over the next year and
then come back with a recom-
mendation to City Council,"
McMurtrie said. "It's more diffi-
cult with group housing because
it involves multiple people using
shared (recycling) carts."
Mailings with instructions for
signing up to participate were
sent out to a significant portion
of the nearly 33,000 total homes
in Ann Arbor. For those students
living off campus in houses and
invited to participate in the initia-
tive, the benefits of recycling each
week can add up.
Melody Serafino, a spokeswom-
an for New York-headquartered
RecycleBank, said participants
can earn an average of $130-$200
per year in rewards.
"The main incentive for the
student who probably is on a bit
of a budget ... is the rewards pro-
gram," Serafino said.
The rewards program allows
recyclers to turn their acquired
RecycleBank points into food,
home goods, entertainment items
and more at RecycleBank.com for
use at local businesses, including
Arbor Brewing Company, Down-
town Home and Garden, The Vil-
lage Apothecary and Zingerman's
Deli.
Education senior Rebecca

Long, who lives off campus in a
house divided into multiple apart-
ments, said she'd be inclined to
focus more on recycling if she was
offered incentives.
Along with bolstering local
business and offering residents
rewards, the initiative will bring
additional funds to the city while
decreasing overall city waste.
"The city sees it as a quadruple
win," Serafino said.

Also on hand to visit with stu-

Provost Philip Hanlon and Dean of
Students Laura Blake Jones.
Hanlon said he enjoyed talk-

get feedback from students about
their experiences at the Univer-

"I enjoy interacting with the stu-

at the open house. "I like to hear
about the great things our students

are and what their problems are, if
they have any."
In an interview during the event,

the event to get a chance to chat
with Coleman about biochemistry.
"I was interested because I know
she was a biochem professor,"
Adzemovic, a biochemistry major
said. "I wanted to ask her about
that, but also I just wanted to see
what she was like."

Junior running back Mike Shaw got the start in the Michigan backfield in the Wolverines' win over Connecticut last weekend. He ran for 48 yards on15 carries.

Veteranstill expected
to share carries with
two or more backs
By RYAN KARTJE
Daily SportsEditor
During his first two years as a
Wolverine, Mike Shaw spent a lot
of time waiting.
Despite some carries here and
there in his freshman and sopho-
more seasons, the junior running
back had never been featured in
Michigan's offense, garnering 400
total yards in that span behind
since-departed running backs
Brandon Minor and Carlos Brown.
Those 400 yards led all current
Michigan running backs before the
season, making him the veteran
back in a crowded backfield. But
that begs the question: Why hasn't
he been on the field more often
before now?
"I've seen a mature guy (in
Shaw) who's not guessing or think-
ing, just playing," running backs
coach Fred Jackson said before the
season. "Because a lot of times, you
get a guy with a lot of talent and
they're thinking. It's like Anthony

expecting, to rotate like we did,"
Shaw said. "But when we did, there
was no drop off. One back is good,
but when you have two backs that
can do equal damage, both being
productive and both with fresh
legs, it's gonna help (our) defense in
the long run."
That rotation is something Shaw
and the rest of the crowded back-
field will have to get used to all sea-
son. Even though Shaw and Smith
were the only two to receive carries
last Saturday, Rodriguez remained
adamant that he expects to use
more than two.
Shaw also acknowledged that
Robinson is like a third running
back in the Michigan backfield.
According to Shaw, Robinson's
presence will only help the Wol-
verine ball carriers in the future'
as teams are forced to key on the
speedy signal caller.

Shaw said. "When teams start key-

things more for everybody else. As
of Sept. 4, it was the Denard show,
and I had no problem being a part
of the supporting cast."
He may be waiting to get the ball
at times this year, but the Michigan
coaching staff won't have to wait
any longer for Shaw to make an
impact on the field.

'U' student filmmakers find a future in Michigan with

thing in common: They're drenched. The grips on hand back up a
van until its trunk is nudging the edgof the tent, allowing for safe
transport of the cameras. LSA senior Bhanu Chundu, the director
of "Appleville," laughs in spite of it all.
"We have 20 people and the only thing that matters now is this
tiny little camera," Chundu remarks. He makes a rectangle with
his fingers and frames Ortlieb in an imaginary shot before hearing
thunder in the distance. "Wehave to hurry."
The unexpected weather has eliminated an afternoon's worth
of shooting from the film's already tight schedule. Those cameras
might be damaged, and consideringhowmuchis riding on the com-
pletion of this entirely student-runproduction, this is a big worry.
But for these aspiring Michigan filmmakers, unpredictability is
something they'll have to learn to weather.
The Hollywood of the Midwest
It may seem hard to believe, but the stormed-out set is actually
part of a Hollywood happy ending for Chundu and other Univer-
sity student filmmakers. The victory is the fact they could make
the movie in the first place.
Enrolling in film school in the Great Lakes State over programs
based in Los Angeles or New York may seem counterintuitive.
But not only are these students finding success in the University's
Screen Arts & Cultures program, many of them are also plotting
out their careers within the state.
The recent success of SAC students and graduates could be seen
as indicative of two promising newtrends. One is the rising stature
of the University's SAC program - which is one of the most inten-
sive and well respected film programs outside of the coasts and has
just moved to hi-tech new digs in North Quad. And the other is the
statewide movement to increase Michigan's presence in the film
community by growing and nurturing local cinematic talent.

Drop/Add Arts
Let's face it. At least one of the classes you
registered for sucks. Well, have we got some
solutions for you! Here are some artsy classes
that you can still get into:
COMPLIT 340 - Travels to Greece
Through films, stories, paintings, poems and more, learn exactly what it is
about the human psyche that forms our innate desire to visit Greece.
Pros: Go Greek! The real way.
Cons: No field trip.
RCIDIV 350, Section 003 - Beginning Javanese Dance
Java is the Indonesian island home to capital city Jakarta, as well as sev-
eral zillion world music enthusiasts. Accompanied by a percussive gamelan
ensemble, learn its dance.
Pros: Hippie cred, and lots of it.
Cons: Possible awkwardness for the inflexible.
HISTART 212 - Understanding Architecture
This class is a lecture-based introduction to architecture. What else did you
think it could possibly be?
Pros: Chicks dig architects. True story.
Cons: "Upon completion of the course, the student is expected to demon-
strate an understanding of the ideation context and the formal attributes of
the built environments of various eras." Whaa...?
SAC 236- The Art of Film
This introductory class explores different aspects of filmmaking - even the
technical ones that get glossed over after a commercial break during the
Oscars.
Pros: Watch movies in class.
Cons: $50 lab fee. Seriously?
LHSP 140, Section 001- From Kansas to Munchkin Land
The first half of this course focuses on black-and-white drawing, the second
on painting in color. The goal? To teach you how to "see."
Pros: Lab fee covers models ... but does it cover their naughty bits?
Cons: Could suffer from a "Dead Poets Society" mentality.

SINGLE REVIEW
Kanye West (Feat. Rick Ross, Jay-Z, Justin Vernon and Nikki Minaj)
"Monster"
G.O.O.D/Island Def Jam
For a guy who's known for his bizarre and volatile behavior, Kanye West's music has been anything
but erratic over the years. Hear an East-Coast soul beat with some sped-up samples and a meaty hook,
you immediately think Kanye. With new singles "Power" and now "Monster," it seems that Yeezy's
unpredictablity has finally carried over into his music. With its martian beat and "Thriller" aesthetics,
"Monster" marks a new sound for Kanye, like he finally got the number to George Clinton's weed guy,
and he's buying. The guests just amp up the weirdness factor, with Nikki Minaj alternating between
boombaklat shouts and her best Barbie impression. Justin Vernon's vocals sound more lawnmower than
man, and Jay-Z, though delivering a sub-par verse, sounds possessed. The track's compellingly odd and
oddly compelling, just like the man himself.

EPISODE REVIEW
"Rubicon" - "The Truth Will Out"
Sundays at 9 p.m.
AMC
Back when it humbly began, "Rubicon" made one thing very clear: Its viewers are going to have to be
patient. And for four weeks, the majority of each episode seemed to be devoted to the main characters
frowning and looking around their apartments, offices and houses. But then things got exciting with action,
suspense and intrigue surrounding the crazy covert operations driving the series forward. But this week's
episode "The Truth Will Out" started to regress back into the awkward-silence hole the show was stuck in
early on. Yes, there was some excitement that will definitely amount to a big reveal in an upcoming episode,
but there was also a grand return to pacing and scowling. While "Rubicon" centers on its enigmatic con-
spiracy, the real mystery is whether the show's pacing will ever get resolved.

We know what arts did last summer
Studied Abroad? Lived under a rock? Studied abroad under a rock? Here's what you missed.

Theater Changes
While you were out, the Washtenaw County movie theater
community was rocked by two separate changes. First, in late
April, Showcase Cinemas became Rave following its acquisi-
tion by a Texas motion picture company of the same name.
Besides proving that we still love the '90s, the new Rave has
vastly improved on the old Showcase formula by switching
from Pepsi to Coke products. Then, about two months later,
Briarwood Mall's dollar movie theater closed its doors for
good. The space that once provided second-run flicks for
cheap to preteen mall rats and stingy college dates alike will
now cater to a different crowd. The new occupant, MC Sports,
plans to use the area to expand its collection of hunting and
fishing gear - jocks, 1; movie geeks and deer, 0.

"A Very Potter Sequel"
Let us all hail once again the (totally awesome) talent of Team
StarKid, the theater troupe of Music Theater & Dance students
and graduates that has taken cyberspace by storm with its bril-
liant unauthorized re-imagining of J.K. Rowling's characters.
When it premiered at Walgreen Drama Center in May, we had
nothing but genuine affection for the show's original songs,
humor and creativity. "AVPS" became a genuine phenom-
enon this summer: Hundreds of thousands of YouTube hits, a
soundtrack album that charted on iTunes, an appearance at the
Harry Potter fan convention Infinitus and a shout-out on Enter-
tainment Weekly's Must List have cemented these StarKids'
stellar reputations - and the University's, too.

Old Spice Viral Campaign
It would take one hell of an innovation to land an advertis-
ing campaign on a list of notable summer arts events. Well
Old Spice innovated like you wish your man could innovate,
taking the social media world by storm for an epic two-day
outreach campaign. It started out harmless enough, with a
few personal YouTube responses from Isaiah Mustafa (a.k.a.
the man your man could smell like) to celebrities and fans of
the Old Spice commercials. And the general response was,
"Oh, that's really cool, they're giving back to the fans with an
attractive, shirtless man making grand, manly declarations."
That is, until everyone quickly figured out it was happening in
real time. The videos would be posted on YouTube and linked
in the @OldSpice twitter account (where you can still go back
and find them). But when people responded to these new vid-
eos, the Old Spice man would respond back. Yes, for two days
a complete crew of copywriters and producers from the ad
agency Wieden + Kennedy - and one muscly actor - stood
around on a bathroom set reading the Internet and writing
macho replies. Over 180 macho replies, earning more than 35
million views in just the first week. It was unprecedented. It
was hilarious. It smelled like chainsaws, bear-wrestling and
being a good listener.

Arcade Fire's The Suburbs
Congratulations, Arcade Fire. You've officially become the
biggest band in North America. August saw the release of the
group's third album The Suburbs, which went straight to num-
ber one in three countries and was loved by just about everyone.
But Arcade Fire wasn't content to simply make music this sum-
mer; they strove to change the way we consume it. The band's
Aug. 5 concert at Madison Square Garden was streamed live on
YouTube, with Terry Gilliam directing and a menu of differ-
ent camera angles from which fans could choose. Then came
the interactive video for "We Used To Wait." Thanks to Google
technology, viewers could type in their home addresses and get
a customized video featuring their very own "suburb." Next on
the agenda: Arcade Fire saves Haiti - IN 3-D! OK, maybe not.
Lindsay Lohan Goes To Prison
LiLo got locked up. Every- Aar
one knew it would happen -
sooner or later, but did anyone
expect the process to be so
hilarious? The video of her sen-
tencing was probably the finest
piece of unintentional humor
this summer. It starts off with
what is far and away Lohan's
best performance ever, as she
tells the judge with a straight #
face, "As far as I knew I was in
compliance with my program,"
and seconds later, "I have to provide for myself." But right when
you thought it would be another case of a celebrity getting off
easy, the judge doles out the discipline: 90 days. Lohan reacts
like she was just condemned to die by firing squad. As the judge
lays "into her, Lohan weeps and stares crazy-eyed at her attor-
ney as the latter nods grimly, desperately avoiding eye contact.
Double Rainbow ain't got shit on this. Too bad she served only
14 days. Lady Justice works in mysterious ways, folks.
See SUMMER, Page 3B

"Inception"
Oh my God you guys do you remember when Ellen Page
folded an entire city by waving her hands? And when Joseph
Gordon-Levitt spun around in that hotel hallway and it was all
like "Whoa!" and then the music was going"BRRRNNNHHH"
and there were four different levels of reality but they were all
awesome? But then the crazy ending happened and we were
all like, "What's the reality?" and then someone said "What
is reality, anyway?" and then no one knew. Has anyone even
stopped talking about this movie since July?

SUMMER
From Page 2B
'U' students at Cannes
It was a surprisingly great year for University stu-
dents at Paris's world-famous Cannes Film Festival in
May. LSA senior Claire Sloma starred in "The Myth
of the American Sleepover," a coming-of-age dramedy
that was invited to the festival's International Critic's
Week. Sloma earned raves for her first-ever bigscreen
performance. And LSA senior David Devries was
given the opportunity to participate in the Real Ideas
Studio program, where he was the Director of Pho-
tography for the short documentary competition's
grand prize winner, "Lumieres." Hollywood - or at
least France - better be prepared for the impending
herd of Wolverines.

Give verse a chance

Betty White Becomes Famous ... Again
Last summer, Betty White was just that cute old
lady from "The Golden Girls." A Facebook campaign
to make her an SNL host and a few Snickers ads later,
and Betty White is the coolest grandma since yours
knit sweaters and baked cookies for you when you
were eight. Betty White's Mother's Day hosting gig
of SNL made her, at 88 years, the oldest person to
host and was the highest rated episode in two years.
It also led to an immediate Facebook push for her to
host the Oscars, which tragically failed. Her popular-
ity doesn't show signs of slowing as White announced
her own clothing line and posed for her own 2011 cal-
endar. She will guest star as an anthropology profes-
sor in the season premiere of "Community" to air on
Sept. 23 on NBC after having sizzled in the summer
series "Hot in Cleveland" on TV Land.

The "Lost" Finale
If there's one time not to alienate your fans, it's a
series finale. There will be no more chances to redeem
yourself. You can't go back. The island is done with
you. There is no other life in which you will see us,
brutha. The series finale of "Lost" could never have
wrapped up every mystery. Even the most diehard
fans who obsessed about every small unanswered
question must have realized that. But the final min-
utes of "Lost" sent shockwaves through the fan com-
munity, leaving many wondering and/or texting their
fan friends, "Um, what?" But even after its misfire of a
finale, "Lost" is still one of the most captivating tele-
vision programs of all time with an unprecedented
fan movement. If you missed any or all of the series,
it's not too late to catch up. The fans will still be talk-
ing about this one for years to come.
Gary Coleman Dies
Gary Coleman did a great job of clinging to the
edges of the spotlight years after his "Diff'rent
Strokes" run. He popped in and out of the tabloids
with bankruptcy, fan assault, divorces, domestic
violence, a turbulent medical history and a guber-
natorial race against Arnold Schwarzenneger in
California's 2003 recall election. Clearly, Coleman's
fame went beyond "whatchoo talkin' 'bout, Willis?"
Gary Coleman never stopped trying to turn things
around and find a respectable career with his adult
life. Whether he succeeded is a question to be pon-
dered for years. Coleman died on May 28 and hit
tabloid covers one last time as the celebrity death of
the summer.

You love poetry. You may not know it yet, but you
do. I know how difficult poetry can be. It can ask
you to figure it out, give you all sorts of signals
and then say, "That is not what I meant at all. " Poetry
has made you think you didn't _
understand it. I'm telling you - you
do. And the confusion isn't poetry's
fault, or your fault. It's our fault.,
I mean those of us who haveu
taught poetry, from the university
level to high school and all the way
down. Mostckindergarteners love
poetry because the sounds of the DAVID
words delight them. They even learn LUCAS
the alphabet by learning to recite
a poem that almost anyone read-
ing this can still remember. But too many high school
graduates have given up on the poetry in their text-
books because we've taught them that those poems are
riddles to be solved instead of something to be enjoyed.
No wonder rock'n'roll and hip hop speak to teens in
ways adults fail to understand. No one's asking them to
figure out the hidden meaning of their iPod playlists.
This isn't to say there's not a great deal to be gained
by studying poetry closely, even by paying obsessive
attention to its nuances. I wouldn't be in a graduate
program in English if I didn't think that were true. But
the point is pleasure. We don't read poetry because we
like to solve puzzles; that's what Rubik's Cubes and
Sudoku and "Lost" are for. We read poetry because it
delights us, and helps us make sense of our lives - just
like movies and songs, the stories you read and those
you tell about each other.
But what if poetry doesn't delight you? What if it just
seems too difficult? My bet is that when many people
think of poetry, they think of something like this:
Thou still unravish'd bride of quietness
or, just as heavy,
He holds him with his skinny hand,
"There was a ship," quoth he.
"Hold off! unhand me, greybeard loon!"
Eftsoons his hand dropt he.
These are great poems, yes, but they're both about
200 years old. The former is the first line of John
Keats's "Ode on a Grecian Urn" (1820), the latter an
early stanza of Samuel Taylor Coleridge's "The Rime of
the Ancient Mariner" (1798).
When was the last time you called your boyfriend
"thou"? Or said, "I'm so stressed, I've got a midterm

eftsoons and my prof quothed I needed to get an A on
it." The language of these poems is not the language
we speak (or even read) today, and so they seem diffi-
cult even before we begin to wonder about "meaning."
We can admire these poems and enjoy them, but they
fit our contemporary English about as naturally as we
fit in bonnets and cravats.
So what does poetry look like today? Let me use the
words of one of my own teachers, Charles Wright, a
poet who has said, "Poetry either maximizes the dif-
ferences between the written word and the spoken
word or it minimizes that difference." Let's look at the
second such example in a poem by Mark Halliday, a
50-something poet who teaches at Ohio University:
"Family"
The family drove from Colorado to Pasadena
for Christmas, and Bev unwrapped two games
to give to the boys during the trip,
because she wanted the boys to be happy-
she brought out the games in a motel in Utah-
and thirty-two years later,
thirteen years after Bev's death,
Hal for some reason remembers the motel in Utah
(while making a wry point about motels, or Utah, or
Christmas)
and begins to speak of that evening-
and then at the phrase "to keep the boys happy"
he suddenly has to stop and look away.
The poem is almost deceptively simple. In fact, some
might think it's nothing more than chopped-up prose.
But prose is usually used either to convey informa-
tion or to develop plot and character. Look at the last
It's not all 'forsooth's
and 'thou's.
image, where "he suddenly has to stop and look away."
Prose would have told you Hal started to cry, or told
you more about this relationship. Instead, Halliday
shows you just enough to let you imagine it yourself -
that moment where someone feels his voice break, his
tears become unstoppable - and for me, that hits right
in the gut, where any good work of art should. That's
the stuff of genius. That's poetry.

MITTEN MOVIES
From Page lB
There's one person in particular
who functions as a representative
for both missions: Jim Burnstein,
SAC professor and coordinator
of the screenwriting department.
Burnstein joined the faculty in 1995.
Since then, he has not only built the
screenwriting program from the
ground up, but also helped give SAC
its departmental status.
The lifelong Michigan resident
was a local self-made screenwrit-
er ("Renaissance Man," "D3: The
Mighty Ducks") long before the
state's current film tax incentives
made that career pathlook moresen-
sible. He is also the vice chairman of
the Michigan Film Office Advisory
Council and played a crucial role in
orchestrating those incentives in
2008.
Thanks to the efforts of the Coun-
cil and Michigan Governor Jennifer
Granholm, who approved the pro-
gram with Burnstein standing by
her side, the state now offers more
tax rebates to filmmakers than any-
where else in the country. Produc-
tions that hire local crew members
are eligible for a state tax credit as
high as 42 percent. More than 100
films have been made in Michigan
since the incentives were passed,
and manyofthe moviesbroughthere
represent new in-state job opportu-
nities for University film students.
This gives Burnstein a new
opportunity to serve his students.
With the help of LSA Dean Ter-
rence McDonald, he has designed
a summer internship program to
give ten graduating students jobs on
Michigan-made films like "Youth
in Revolt" and the upcoming "Red
Dawn" remake. And as part of the
drive to showcase Michigan's locally
grown student filmmaking talent to
fellow Michiganders, for two years
now Burnstein and the SAC depart-
ment have brought short films from
their highest-level production class,
SAC 423, to show at the Traverse
City Film Festival (TCFF).
"Rather than all my students mov-
ing to L.A., the idea is they stay home
and get to work on films here, make
contacts, get training and eventually
generate the budgets that become,
you know, Michigan-made movies,"
Burnstein said.
Ironically, the only recent Mich-
igan-made movie to feature the
University prominently was writ-
ten and directed by a University
graduate who didn't come out of
Burnstein's SAC program. "Answer
This!" - which was filmed on and
around campus last fall and is hav-
ing its Ann Arbor premiere at the
Michigan Theater on Oct. 8 - fol-
lows a Wolverine graduate student
through the world of competitive bar
trivia.Writer-director Chris Farah is
a Michigan alum, but his 1998 under-
graduate degree was in English, and
his Master's in 2002 was in Near-
Eastern Studies.
When Farah was a student in the

mid-'90s, the SAC program wasn't
what it is today.
"The program that you're talking
about has really, really developed
and come into its own under Jim
Burnstein's leadership over the last,
I would say, ten years or so," Farah
said.
"There was still a feeling for
many people that making mov-
ies was something that happened
in Los Angeles ... If somebody had
been interested in pursuing that, you
would have gone to UCLA or USC."
The mindset's a bit different now.
Michael Burke and Erin Whitte-
more, two recent graduates from
the SAC program who each penned
one of the SAC 423 films shown at
Traverse City, are both planning to
stay in Michigan for the foresee-
able future to pursue screenwriting
careers.
"It's a bit up in the air for me right
now," said Whittemore, an LSA
graduate who wrote "Margaret and
Izzey," which is about a girl reunit-
ing with her imaginary friend. "But
for the moment, though, I'm staying
here."
"We're slightly bigger fish in a
smaller pond here," said Burke, who
holds a dual degree from LSA and
the Ross School of Business. Burke
wrote "Camp Chapel," a comedy
about a troublemaker sent to church
camp. He viewed Traverse City as a
chance to market his script to pro-
spective buyers. "I will bartend for
years before I give up the hope ... I
have some semblance of a chance to
actually make it, and why not do my
best to do it?"
Rounding the festival circuit
At noon on July 29 in Traverse
City's Opera House, approximately
two dozen SAC students shuffle
into the converted screening room,
each wearing dressy attire and yel-
low lanyards around their necks
announcing their identities as
"FILMMAKER." They are a mix of
writers, directors, producers, edi-
tors, actors, composers and every
other job title under the sun. They
file into the reserved seating in the
theater's back two rows and settle in
to watch an auditorium full of people
watch their movies.
Outside the screening room is
a table with various booklets and
swag promoting Ann Arbor and the
University as a place to host big stu-
dio film productions. The front of
the booklet reads, "Ann Arbor: The
Smart Location." Clearly, the stu-
dents aren't the only ones hoping
to walk away from the festival with
some deals in their pocket.
There's a good crowd here, espe-
cially considering these student
short films are competing in this
time slot with Hollywood-caliber
productions like "Solitary Man"
and "Waiting for 'Superman,' " both
screening simultaneously in venues a
few blocks away. But not only is the
audience sizeable, it's also ecstatic.
Film industry precedent states
that crowds at festivals are always
going to be more appreciative than

normal, but it's still hard to deny the
rapturous reception given to "Camp
Chapel" and "Margaret and Izzey."
When the lights go up, the applause
is wild - for the films and for the
parade of students and professors
who take up the entire expanse of
the stage afterward.
Admittedly, the crowd contains
many University faculty, alumni and
associates, who may be inclined to
applaud for their school as much as
for the films themselves. Still, to even
have their films present at one of the
largest festivals in the Midwest is a
big deal, and the experience provides
a taste of the future success every
student on stage is striving for.
"We always kind of said this was
the gateway into the real world of
filmmaking," Burnstein says to the
crowd. He points to the student
producers of each film, LSA senior
James Alsobrooks and recent LSA
graduate Mercedes Holguin. "If you
want to know who's gonna be run-
ning Hollywood, even if Hollywood's
in Michigan, take a good look."
A reception is held for the stu-
dents after the screening at sushi
bistro Red Ginger. It's sponsored by
the Miller Canfield Law Firm, which
specializes in entertainment law and
also paid lodging and other expenses
for the SAC 423 contingent's stay.
Here the University students and
professors intermingle with a cross-
section of professional filmmakers
who are also showing works at the
festival.
Burke proudly shows off the per-
sonalized business cards he brought
along; each one is attached to a flash
drive containing the entirety of his
"Camp Chapel" script. He's hoping
that someone willbite.
Festival founder Michael Moore
shows up at one point for a quick
speech. The former UM-Flint drop-
out and current Spartan fan tries to
playfully insult the University, but
he's drowned out when the entire
room breaks into a rousing chorus of
"The Victors."

Nevertheless, the students are all
eager to talk to the Oscar winner,
and promptly swarm him after he's
finished his speech.
"I tell them that they should defi-
nitely go to the University of Michi-
gan and then drop out," Moore said
before the festival when askedby the
Daily what advice he gives to stu-
dents looking to pursue a career in
filmmaking. "That's the great thing
about U of M is that it works both
ways. Stay and get your degree, or go
for a while and drop out. Any time
spent at the University of Michigan
will be time well spent."
Moore is a bit more serious dur-
ing the Michigan Film Office Advi-
sory Council meeting the next day.
He explains that he's funding the
"State Theater Project," an effort to
renovate rundown movie theaters
throughout the state. His sincere
desire to revitalize the state through
film-based initiatives have made
Moore, along with Burnstein, one
of the most influential men in the
Michigan film community.
Prior to Moore's announcements,
Burnstein takes the floor to present
the council with the Michigan Cre-
ative Film Alliance. The program, he
explains, is a joint effortbetween the
state's top three research schools -
Michigan, MSU and WSU - to pro-
duce an ultra-low-budget short film,
with actors from the Screen Actor's
Guild. The 21-person crew - com-
prising seven students from each
university - was selected by a joint
committee of professors from all
three schools.
The film? "Appleville," a heist
comedy written by Whittemore.
Chundu had been chosen to direct,
meaning that the Michigan Cre-
ative Film Alliance would be
making a movie both written and
directedby University of Michigan
students and filmed at the North
Campus Research Complex.
WhenBurnstein finishes, Emery
King, head of the council, asks the
SAC students sitting in the back of
Highlights:

-Live Music&
Entertainment

the room to stand up so the room can
acknowledge them. "Good luck to
you with your careers, and thanks so
much for beingihere," he says.
The room claps.
The third act
"So remember when Isaid an ideal
situation comingoutofTraverse City
was getting a job?" Burke wrote in an
e-mail in mid-August, as "Applev-
ille" was shooting. "Well it worked!"
Though not involving screenwrit-
ing as he had hoped, Burke's new
job still rounded out a nicely cyclical
story: He had joined the PR team for
Farah's "Answer This!" Fittingly, one
of Burke's central tasks was to orga-
nize a short film competition encour-
aging people, including students, to
submit their own "love letters to Ann
Arbor."
Meanwhile, Whittemore, Chundu
and the rest of the "Appleville" crew
had to learn fast in order to complete
a film bigger in every way than any-
thing they had attempted before.
Camera tracks were made out of
actual metal instead of the plastic
pipe and sandbags typically used for
SAC 423 productions. Police officers
had to be on hand when prop guns
were used above a certain eye levelin
case passers-by mistook which kind
of shooting they were seeing.
"All this stuff I learned in just the
last two months," Whittemore said
of the in-depth production process.

Despite the increased crew presence,
everyone on set still had to perform
multiple jobs out of necessity.
Thankfully, the storm on the 11th
didn't set the production back too
much, and the crew was able to reas-
semble later in the day to squeeze
out another couple hours of film-
ing. They even finished on schedule,
which bodes well for the floating
prospect of the Michigan Creative
Film Alliance becoming an annual
program.
But first, "Appleville" needs to
make something of itself. Chundu
and Krane, along with various edi-
tors, sound designers and super-
visors, are currently buried deep
in post-production. They have to
turn in the finished product by Dec.
10 for its planned premiere at the
Detroit Film Theater this winter,
and Chundu hopes to take it to more
film festivals in the coming year. For
the current students involved in the
project, they now have to balance
their Creative Film Alliance work
with a full credit load at school.
If their endeavors are success-
ful, there will certainly be yet more
reason to believe in the power of
the University's SAC department.
Combined with the state's already-
existing tax incentive, the program
can create and support Michigan's
homegrown filmmaking population.
But what happens from there is
anyone's guess. This is the movie
business, after all.
