Rear Admiral Michael Gior-

gione, author of “Inside Camp 
David: The Private World 
of the Presidential Retreat,” 
spoke Wednesday night at the 
Gerald R. Ford Presidential 
Library to discuss his book 
and share personal anecdotes 
from his time at the camp. 

Giorgione was the com-

manding 
officer 
of 
Camp 

David, a country retreat used 
by U.S. presidents and their 
families, from 1999 to 2001. 
During that time, he worked 
under Presidents Bill Clinton 
and George W. Bush. Located 
in the wooded hills of Catoc-
tin Mountain Park in Mary-
land, Camp David, according 
to Giorgione, has been Ameri-
can diplomacy’s secret weap-
on since its founding in 1938, 
playing a vital role in both 
international 
and 
domestic 

relationships.

The Public Policy library 

often invites speakers or hosts 
events that are related to the 
presidency, Elaine Didier, the 
director of the library and its 
affiliated museum in Grand 
Rapids, explained.

“We have both journal-

ists and scholars who are 
researching different presi-
dents, looking at issues that 
the presidents cover, and in 
this case, it’s not the presiden-
cy but a place that the presi-

dents used,” she said. “So that 
was the driver in inviting Mr. 
Giorgione here.”

The lecture began with 

audience 
members 
sitting 

in a pitch-black room, with 
the lights turned off. Almost 
immediately, the sound of 
choppers 
played 
over 
the 

speakers. 
Giorgione 
used 

these effects to highlight a 
typical start to a working day 
at Camp David: the arrival of 
the president.

Edward Vincent, an Ann 

Arbor 
community 
member, 

said he enjoyed the use of 
auditory effects during the 
presentation.

“That really stood out to 

me because that was a very 
dramatic 
and 
suspenseful 

moment. I wasn’t sure if he 
was going to put something on 
the screen. But he used that to 
dramatize how Camp David is 
when the president isn’t there 
and when he is,” he said.

Giorgione 
describes 
the 

camp as a simple place.

“It’s a very nice camp with 

very plain facilities. Single 

story structures. No brass. 
No polish. No marble. That’s 
Camp David. That’s part of 
the allure of this mountaintop 
retreat at 1,800-feet eleva-
tion.” he said.

Such plainness is what cre-

ates the tranquil nature, he 
explained — there is an inti-
macy to the place that cannot 
be felt in the West Wing of the 
White House. Giorgione fur-
ther recounted moments spent 
with members of the Kennedy 
family who have spent every 

Researchers from the Mcity 

Test Facility at the University 
of Michigan are using virtual 
reality to more safely and 
efficiently 
test 
driverless 

vehicles.

The Mcity Test Facility is 

located on North Campus and 
features over 16 acres of roads 
and traffic infrastructure. The 
facility 
allows 
researchers 

to 
test 
automated 
vehicles 

and 
other 
technologies 
in 

simulated urban and suburban 
driving environments.

With a virtual world, similar 

to the simulated environment 
of a video game, researchers 
can test real driverless vehicles 
in an almost infinite number 
of traffic scenarios that would 
be difficult and costly to test 
in real world environments. In 
the augmented reality testing 
environment, real autonomous 
vehicles 
interact 
with 

computer-simulated vehicles.

The 
testing 
method 
of 

using 
augmented 
reality 

was outlined in an MCity

During 
the 
University 

of Michigan’s fifth annual 
Giving Blueday, donors gave 
a total of $3,638,612 to the 
University, according to a 
University press release. Over 
12,600 
donors 
contributed 

over the course of the 24-hour 
event, 
though 
the 
sum 

donated has decreased by 
close to a million dollars since 
2017.

In comparison to previous 

years, the amount of donors 
has increased while the total 
amount raised has decreased. 
In 2016, about 7,000 donors 
raised over $5.5 million on 
Giving Blueday and in 2017, 
over 
8,000 
donors 
raised 

over $4.4 million. The size 
of the average donation has 
decreased considerably, from 
approximately $753 in 2016 to 
$288 this year.

“Our 
primary 
goal 

for Giving Blueday is to 
encourage as many people 
as 
possible 
to 
donate 
to 

U-M, no matter the size of 
the gift,” Pamela Stout, the 
senior director of executive 
communications, wrote in an 
email statement. “We’ve been 
fortunate enough to increase 
that number every year. This 
year, we focused even more 
directly on the goal of 10,000 
gifts, and are thrilled with the 
12,635 gifts received in just 24 
hours.

According to Stout, the 

total 
sum 
of 
donations 

drastically varies based on 
the size of gifts.

“In 
previous 
years, 
we 

booked 
more 
major 
gifts 

on Giving Blueday.” Stout 
wrote. “This year, we focused 
more directly on expanding 
our community of donors, 
and they very generously 
responded.”

Samples show rise in dioxane levels, 
need for more tests around Ann Arbor

JACK SILBERMAN/DAILY

2018 brings in more donors but less 
overall donations than previous year

Mayor Taylor emphasized likely carcinogen has not been found in Ann Arbor water 

NIKKI KIM
For The Daily

Water samples taken from 

the storm sewers at West 
Park in Ann Arbor reveal 
an increase in the levels of 1,4 
dioxane — a likely carcinogen — 
in the groundwater. Within a 
year, the samples jumped from 
4.4 parts per billion to 19 parts 
per billion.

In response to the increase 

in 
dioxane 
contamination, 

the Michigan Department of 
Environmental 
Quality 
has 

confirmed plans for further 
dioxane testing in Ann Arbor.

Evan Pratt, water resources 

commissioner of Washtenaw 
County, said while he does not 
think the dioxane in the West 
Park groundwater is dangerous 
to 
residents, 
he 
supports 

continued testing in the area.

“What I’ve asked of the DEQ 

is for them to) take samples 
every month for six months. 
Then we can have a better 

understanding of whether it 
is something that is a trend at 
that location or just something 
that fluctuates,” Pratt said. 
“In addition, I’ve asked for 
sampling at four or five other 
locations.” 

In an MLive article, Gerald 

Tiernan, 
district 
supervisor 

of 
the 
DEQ’s 
Remediation 

and Redevelopment Division, 
confirmed Pratt’s sentiments, 
explaining the DEQ plans to 
take monthly samples from 
multiple locations within the 

area.

Mayor Christopher Taylor 

said the city will continue to 
support further testing.

“We are always looking for 

more testing — it is of critical 
importance to the city of Ann 
Arbor,” Taylor said. “We need 
to make sure that our homes are 
safe, that our drinking water is 
safe. We are going to continue 
to learn more about the location 
and direction of the plume and 
we are going to continue to

The 
University 
of 

Michigan 
announced 
the 

launch 
of 
the 
Michigan 

Education Research Institute 
and Michigan Education Data 
Center 
Tuesday 
morning, 

presenting 
a 
collaboration 

between 
the 
University, 

Michigan State University, 
Michigan 
Department 
of 

Education and Center for 
Educational Performance and 
Information.

The 
new 
research 

collaboration 
and 
data 

center will conduct research 
projects in early childhood, 
K-12 
and 
postsecondary 

education and evaluate data 
to improve performance in 

public schools across the 
state. 
The 
collaboration 

creates 
the 
opportunity 

for 
policy 
leaders 
and 

government officials to work 
together with top university 
experts on education and 
policy analysis.

The 
Interim 
State 

Superintendent Sheila Alles 
said 
in 
aUniversity 
press 

release 
the 
department 

looks forward to the 
partnership 
forged 

between 
the 
two 

Michigan 
universities 

and 
the 
state 

government.

“Becoming a top 10 

education state in 10 
years takes a knowledge 
of what is happening 
in 
our 
schools 
now, 

learning 
what 
has 

proven successful and 
using that to develop 
better 
practices 
for 

all our educators and 
students,” Alles said.

The 
Michigan 

Education Data Center, 
housed 
at 
the 
Ford 

School of Public Policy, 
will host and process 
educational data given 
to 
researchers 
while 

protecting 
students’ 

private information.

“While 
ensuring 

privacy 
and 

confidentiality 
of 

students’ data, we will 
be able to learn what 

works and what doesn’t so 
our educators can provide the 
best education for Michigan’s 
students,” University Public 
Policy 
professor 
Susan 

Dynarski said in the release.

One of the first projects 

of the Michigan Education 
Research Institute plans to 
conduct is an implementation 
study 
of 
Michigan’s 

Competency-Based Education 
Pilot. 
The 
study 
involves 

surveys of both educators 
and students, as well as site 
visits to pilot schools. In the 
release, Michael Barr, dean 
of the Public Policy School, 
said he hopes the research 
will inform the Department 
of Education on how to better 
meet the needs of the schools 
transitioning to competency-
based models

“Our faculty have proven 

their commitment to applying 
research to solve education 
policy 
challenges, 
and 

through MERI will be able 
to make a big contribution 
to helping Michigan’s young 
people,” Barr said.

a“We are so excited to fund 

this 
unique 
collaboration 

between 
the 
state 
of 

Michigan, @UMich and @
michiganstateu to improve 
schools by looking at the 
impact 
of 
policies 
and 

practices and finding out 
what works!” the Laura and 
John 
Arnold 
Foundation 

tweeted Wednesday.

‘U’ joins in partnership with MSU, 
state government to research education

MAEVE O’BRIEN
Daily Staff Reporter


Thanksgiving at Camp David, 
with Chelsea Clinton who gave 
her old stuffed dolls to Gior-
gione’s kids to use, and with 
Laura Bush who loved to play in 
autumn leaves on the lawn.

Jerri 
Jenista, 
a 
hospital 

worker at the Medical School, 
said she enjoyed hearing about 
the presidents’ everyday lives.

“It was nice to hear that the 

presidents were real people, 
they have real lives, their fami-
lies are real people,” she said.

The retreat is necessary, he 

Giorgione says, because of the 
lonely sentry theory, an idea 
he references from his book. 
The theory states a marine will 
patrol alone all night in freezing 
subzero weather because of his 
duty to the country. In his mind, 
the marine is the president.

Giorgione 
discussed 
the 

challenges of being in place of 
responsibility as well as com-

mand, where all eyes are on 
them.

“They don’t really have a 

place to getaway that often but 
maybe this is the one place that 
they can getaway.” he said.

Giorgione also discussed the 

challenges of being a leader, 
whether that is the responsibil-
ity that comes with being the 
commanding officer of Camp 
David 
or 
the 
international 

challenges 
the 
president 
of 

the country faces. That is why 
Camp David is so necessary, he 

said, to offer a tranquil escape.

Though Camp David was 

primarily a retreat for the 
presidents, it has also been the 
grounds for international talks 
and peace treaties. From Presi-
dent Ronald Reagan entertain-
ing 
British 
Prime 
Minister 

Margaret Thatcher to President 
Franklin D. Roosevelt and Brit-
ish Prime Minister Winston 
Churchill smoking cigars and 
discussing how and when the 
U.S. will enter WWII.

“It still comes down to two 

people building human rela-
tionships,” Giorgione said. “You 
have to get face to face. You 
have to get to know each other.”

Giorgione told another story 

from his book, dubbed the 
“infamous horseshoe incident.” 
In 1990, Bush invited Presi-
dent Mikhail Gorbachev of the 
former Soviet Union to Camp 
David, where they then engaged 
in a game of horseshoe tossing.

Bush had always been an avid 

fan competitive games, Gior-
gione said. But, Gorbachev, 

despite not having ever tossed 
a single horseshoe, gets a ringer 
for the first time. 

“It is the little things that 

resonate and stay with you,” he 
said. “It is perfect but natural.” 

work with our partners.” 

The 
dioxane 
plume 
was 

introduced to the groundwater 
after Ann Arbor manufacturer 
Gelman Sciences, now Danaher 
Corp., released the chemical as 
an industrial byproduct into 
an unlined lagoon from 1966 
to 1986. The chemical was able 
to leech into the underlying 
groundwater 
and 
the 

contaminated plume continues 
to spread underground. The 
plume 
was 
first 
reported 

in 1969 and has since spread, 
covering an area more than 
three miles long and a mile 
wide.

As the pollutant progresses 

underground through the Allen 
River and West Park, it moves 
toward the Huron River. and 
possibly 
Barton 
Pond, 
Ann 

Arbor’s 
main 
source 
for 

drinking water.

“Once it’s in West Park, it’s 

pretty easy for it to get to the 
river,” Pratt said. “It’s really 
primarily testing to find out 
if the tip of the plume, which 
is the weakest part, is headed 
towards the park.”

The tip of the plume, as 

estimated by test results, is 
believed to be moving east 
through West Park. Pratt said 
one of the primary aspects the 
tests is looking at is which way 
the plume is heading.

“We are definitely going 

to keep monitoring it and 
making 
sure 
it 
is 
moving 

east and not north because 

if it’s headed north, there’s 
potential it could get upstream 
and head towards the water 
treatment plant,” Pratt said. 
“One of our primary goals is 
to make sure it’s not moving 
 

toward the water treatment 
plant.”

Outside of polluting water, 

the DEQ acknowledges dioxane 
could potentially pose vapor 
intrusion health risks.

The 
Agency 
for 
Toxic 

Substances 
and 
Disease 

Registry explainshumans can 
be exposed to the contaminant 
through both air and direct 
skin contact.

“1,4-Dioxane can be released 

into the air, water, and soil at 
places where it is produced or 
used as a solvent,” the website 
reads.

While dioxane can enter the 

air, skin contact is unlikely and 
usually through substances like 
lotions.

 “Your skin may come into 

contact with 1,4-dioxane when 
you use cosmetics, detergents, 
and 
shampoos 
containing 

1,4-dioxane,” the website reads.

Despite 
potential 
vapor 

intrusion health risks, Pratt 
argues dioxane is not a chemical 
like gasoline, which is can be 
easily separated from water and 
released into the air.

“Dioxane 
is 
not 
a 
good 

thing at any levels, but it is 
not 
absorbed 
through 
the 

skin and the likelihood of the 
chemical entering the air is 
not high,” Pratt said. “From 
my understanding, it is not a 
chemical that wants to break 
free from water. It wants to 
stay in water once it’s in water. 

It does not want to vaporize and 
go into the air.” 

However, Pratt said the DEQ 

will continue to look into vapor 
intrusion risks.

Residents have also expressed 

concern regarding whether the 
polluted groundwater may find 
its way into their basement. 
But Pratt said the residents 
near West Park need not worry, 
 

explaining any flooding the 
residents might experience is 
caused by rainwater, not the 
plume.

“A lot of people are quick to 

tie rain water in the basement to 
the dioxane plume, but the two 
are not correlated,” Pratt said. 
“The houses are substantially 
higher than the ground and 
the ground is a little bit higher 
than the groundwater. The 
groundwater is separated from 
the basements beyond where 
the EPA would even think 
about keeping an eye on it, as 
far as would it possibly get into 
somebody’s 
basement. 
Right 

now, it doesn’t seem possible.”

The 
U.S. 

Environmental 
Protection 

Agency classifies dioxane as 
likely to be carcinogenic to 
humans via water, air and, in 
some cases, direct skin contact. 
The chemical is also linked 
to potential kidney and liver 
damage as well as respiratory 
issues 
through 
long-term 

exposure.

According to the EPA, only a 

few parts per billion of dioxane 
in drinking water over a long 
period of exposure can pose a 1 
in 100,000 cancer risk.

The dioxane levels are well 

below state standards even 

though 
Michigan 
standards 

for dioxane in groundwater 
venting to surface water were 
tightened earlier in the year.

The national advisory for 

dioxane in surface waters 
that 
are 
protected 
as 

drinking water is 3.5 parts 
per billion, while the limit 
for dioxane in surface waters 
that are not protected as 
drinking water sources is 
280 parts per billion. For the 
 

dioxane 
in 
residential 

drinking water, the state’s 
separate limit is 7.2 parts per 
billion. 

Taylor 
emphasized 

dioxane 
has 
never 
been 

found in Ann Arbor drinking 
water.

“It is incredibly important 

that 
we 
understand 
the 

nature of the plume and the 
risks that are associated with 
dioxane,” Taylor said. “It’s 
also important to understand 
that it’s never been found 
in 
Ann 
Arbor 
drinking 

water and that we are doing 
everything we can that folks 
in Ann Arbor remain safe.”

While 
Pratt 
supports 

further testing, he said much 
of the testing for dioxane 
has come up negative and he 
does not currently see the 
pollution as a threat to the 
city.

“There isn’t any threat 

specifically to anybody — 
everybody in the city is on 
wells, but we’d like it cleaned 
up even though that’s not 
what the current legal system 
says (and) the county is in 
court fighting for something 
better.”

The plume is a source of an 

ongoing legal battle against 
Gelman Sciences by Ann Arbor, 
Washtenaw 
County, 
Scio 

Township, The Huron River 

Watershed Council and the 
state.

Stout also revealed previous 

donor number statistics may 
not be comparable to current 
statistics 
due 
to 
a 
recent 

software change. This year, 
the individual number of gifts 
from donors was calculated, 
whereas in previous years, the 
number of donor transactions 
was calculated. This means 
that there is not a statistic to 
compare the exact number 
of donors from this year to 
previous years. The number 
of gifts does not necessarily 
reflect the number of donors 
because 
some 
donors 
give 

multiple gifts.

All 
three 
University 

campuses 
–– 
Ann 
Arbor, 

Dearborn 
and 
Flint 
–– 

participated in Giving Blueday, 
which 
coincides 
with 
the 

national Giving Tuesday after 

Thanksgiving. Donors could 
choose to direct gifts to various 
funds across the University, a 
specific school or college, or 
student organizations.

The University release also 

reported 
LSA 
received 
the 

most gifts through the Giving 
Blueday 
website 
this 
year, 

while the Michigan Sailing 
Team raised the most money 
out of any student organization 
through the website.

The 
amount 
of 
student 

participation 
in 
Giving 

Blueday 
increased 
for 
the 

fourth straight year, as over 
150 student organizations took 
part.

Dance Marathon raised the 

most money out of any student 
organization 
overall. 
Other 

student orgs such as MUSIC 
Matters and the Health Policy 
Students Association ranked 
in the top 10 organizations to 
increase donors from last year 
by the highest percentages.

The 
Michigan 
Sailing 

Team, 
SAE-Michigan 

Baja Racing and M-Fly all 
received monetary prizes to 
contribute to their cause for 
ranking as the top three student 
orgs to increase donor turnout 
by the highest percentage.

According 
to 
the 
press 

release, first-time donors who 
donated $50 or more to the 
University received an extra 
$50 to donate to the cause of 
their choice. First time student 
donors who donated $25 to U-M 
received an additional $25 to 
give to a fund of their choice.

LSA senior Marina Ross, 

co-chair of The Quito Project, 
spoke about the impact of the 
funds raised during Giving 
Blueday. The Quito Project 
is an organization run by 
University students who work 
in partnership with students 
from the Universidad de San 
Francisco in Quito, Ecuador, 
to hold a free summer camp 

program for Quito children in 
extreme poverty. 

According to Ross, The Quito 

Project raised about $200 on 
Giving Blueday in 2017. This 
year, they raised approximately 
$1600.

“We are going to use (the 

funds) to run the entire summer 
camp,” Ross said. “We do 
provide our students with two 
meals a day, so we’ll use that 
money to actually purchase all 
the food and also pay the local 
workers there that will prepare 
it.”

Donors on Giving Blueday 

also contributed to the Victors 
for Michigan campaign, which 
extends until December 2018 
and continues to break public 
university fundraising records. 
The campaign has raised $5 
billion to date.

week. Henry Liu, a research 
professor at the University 
Transportation 
Research 

Institute, 
developed 
this 

testing 
technology 
with 

UMTRI assistant research 
scientist Yiheng Feng.

Currently, Liu and Feng 

have a patent pending for the 
testing technology. 

Liu 
explained 
while 

augmented 
reality 
is 
not 

exactly the same as a real 
world environment, testing 
autonomous 
vehicles 
in 

a 
virtual 
environment 

eliminates 
many 
of 
the 

restrictions of testing in the 
real world.

“Testing driverless vehicles 

in 
an 
augmented 
reality 

environment is not going to be 
as ‘accurate’ as testing in the 
‘real world,’” Liu wrote in an 
email interview. “However, 
testing in the real world has a 
number of limitations that are 
difficult to overcome.”

Liu cited safety as a top 

limitation 
and 
concern 

when 
testing 
autonomous 

vehicles 
in 
real 
world 

environments. Testing in a 
virtual environment is safer, 
he said, because there have 
been many driverless vehicle 
accidents when testing in the 
real world. According to Liu 
and Feng’s publication, there 
have been 26 crashes while 
testing autonomous vehicles 
at their site in California from 
2014 to 2017. 

Liu explained augmented 

reality also makes testing 
autonomous 
vehicles 
more 

efficient because researchers 
can 
simulate 
rare 
traffic 

scenarios that may be difficult 
to find in the real world.

“Most of the testing in the 

real world is not very useful, 
as the testing environment 
is repetitive and it is not 
challenging to autonomous 
vehicles,” Liu wrote. “What 
is important is to find ‘corner 
cases’ 
that 
can 
challenge 

autonomous 
vehicles, 
but 

‘corner cases’ are rare events 

so it is not easy to find in the 
real world.”

Mcity Director Huei Peng 

Huei 
Peng 
supported 
the 

use 
of 
augmented 
reality 

in the testing of University 
driverless vehicles.

“Since virtual vehicles are 

used, instead of real vehicles, 
we 
can 
simulate 
risky 

situations without the real 
safety risk, we do not need 
to waste fuel and we can run 
continuously,” Peng said. “So 
it is safer, cheaper and faster 
compared with using real test 
vehicles.”

Engineering 
senior 

Michelle Kearney has been a 
research assistant at UMTRI 
for her entire undergraduate 
career. At Mcity, she has been 
involved with several studies 
on passenger behavior and 
responses 
to 
autonomous 

vehicles.

“Our recent tests at MCity 

have focused on the safety of 
individuals who are actively 
engaged 
in 
a 
task 
other 

than driving (i.e. working 
on a laptop, reading a book, 
etc.) and are subjected to an 
abrupt automatic braking or 
lane change by the vehicle,” 
Kearney wrote in an email 
interview. “In addition to 
safety 
considerations, 
the 

study also provided great 
insight 
into 
consumer 

response 
to 
unanticipated 

abrupt vehicle movements.”

Kearney 
said 
using 

augmented reality for testing 
autonomous vehicles will help 
advance research of consumer 
safety.

“Simulators 
can 
be 

very 
important 
tools 
in 

autonomous vehicle research, 
as they allow researchers to 
gather key information about 
consumer 
preferences 
and 

behaviors with regards to 
autonomous vehicles without 
requiring individuals to trust 
the actual vehicle for a test 
drive,” Kearney wrote. “It 
is going to be a slow process 
to convince the public that 
these vehicles are safe and 
reliable, 
so 
using 
virtual 

reality simulation is a good 
first step.”

letters 
of

abroad 
in 
Israel. 

Administrators disciplined the

John 
Cheney-

Lippold 
of

his action did not “support

Members of the University 

community 
have 
been 

outspoken about their opinions 
on the instructors’ actions and 
the University’s response, and 
several events and panels have 
sought 
to 
foster 
campus 

discussion around the topic. 
Some have felt the University’s 
response has been inadequate, 
while 
others 
argue 
the 

University’s 
punishment 

of 
Cheney-Lippold 
was 

unwarranted. 
Public 
Health 

student 
Melissa 
Makled 

attended a panel on academic 
freedom held this Tuesday 

and said she was curious to see 
where the University will take 
this issue in the future.

“I’ve been unimpressed with 

the University’s response and 
I really liked the Graduate 
Employees 
Organization’s 

response,” 
Makled 
said 
at 

Tuesday’s event. “I really liked 
the nuance in their stance 
because they say it’s not a 
political decision, but a matter 
of academic freedom.” 

At 
the 
Faculty 
Senate 

lecture, 
Neil 
Marsh, 
chair 

of 
the 
University’s 
central 

faculty governance, gave the 
introductory remarks. Marsh 
noted upholding these values 
“requires continuous vigilance 
and courage.”

“This lecture is an example 

that academic and intellectual 
freedom are essential … for a 
university,” Marsh said.

Nichol, 
who 
described 

himself as a self-proclaimed 
“devotee 
of 
public 

universities,” 
detailed 
his 

personal pitfalls and views 
on the unique struggles that 
public 
universities 
have 
in 

terms of constitutional rights, 

specifically 
the 
issue 
of 

freedom of speech.

“The constitution itself is not 

self-triggering,” Nichol said. 
“It often requires blood and 
sacrifice and bravery.”

Nichol cited this bravery 

specifically 
as 
intellectual 

courage as he went on to 
explain 
the 
main 
problem 

public universities face: the 
intersection of free speech 
and equal protection. He gave 
the example of boycotts, as 
well as sexual harassment and 
bullying policies as measures 
that threaten to weaponize the 
freedom of speech.

“When a University is sued 

for implementing harassment 
and 
bullying 
policies, 
the 

dispute 
usually 
presents 

competing 
and 
colliding 

essential constitutional values 
of equality and expression,” 
Nichol said. “When a faculty 
member or a graduate student 
participates in an expressive 

boycott, 
speech 
and 

equal 
protection 
guarantees 

can meet head on. Perhaps the 
collision can be avoided, but it’s 
not always easy work.”

Nichol 
also 
detailed 
his 

personal struggles with the 
University of North Carolina 
at 
Chapel 
Hill. 
At 
UNC, 

the 
governing 
boards 
are 

handpicked by state legislative 
leadership, which, according to 
Nichol, causes administrative 
suppression.

“Academic 
freedom 
is 

deeply weakened in places, 
including my home,” Nichol 
said. “If the last decade has 
taught us anything, it is that 
there are fewer fixed stars, 
fewer uncontested, consensus-
based constitutional standards 
and patterns of behavior that 
we 
might 
have 
supposed,” 

Nichol said. “Who would have 
thought, for example, that a 
dominant political party would 
take as a central agenda point 
the suppression of the effective 
exercise of the right to vote. 
Who would have guessed a 
large 
segment 
of 
political 

leadership would overtly seek 
to limit the active participation 
of African Americans without 
shame or embarrassment?”

T

his past Monday, the White 
House 
Correspondents’ 
Association 
announced 
it would be departing 
from its usual tradition 
of inviting a comedian to 
roast the president and 
the press corps at next 
year’s 
annual 
White 
House Correspondents’ 
Dinner. Instead, in a 
controversial decision, 
the organization has 
invited 
renowned 
historian Ron Chernow 
to deliver a speech 
on First Amendment rights and 
freedom of the press. Though these 
topics are certainly relevant to 
today’s volatile political climate and 
the strained relationship between 
the media and the President 
Donald Trump’s administration, 
the WHCA’s decision to stray from 
a decades old tradition ultimately 
compromises the very principles 
upon which the association was 
founded.
There are plenty of reasons why 
the WHCA should continue to host 
comedians at its annual dinner, but 
let’s first start with the obvious—the 
comedy roast is literally the only 
notable part of the event.
The 
annual 
White 
House 
Correspondents’ dinner is an ornate 
black-tie spectacle during which 
journalists and politicians get to 
schmooze with A-list Hollywood 
celebrities and athletes. For many 
of us, the event is simply a reminder 
of the stark divide between the elite 
and regular, everyday Americans. 
But for a mere 20 minutes or so, the 
unforgiving comedy roast reminds 
us that the rich and powerful are 
human, and they are not invincible. 
From the late Steve Bridges’ uncanny 
George W. Bush impression to Seth 
Meyers’s relentless mocking of 
then-candidate Trump’s “birther” 
controversy, 
America’s 
most 
beloved comedians have shown us 
even presidents and billionaires are 
not immune to the sting of satire.
Though public regard for the 
dinner is sure to dwindle following 
the WHCA’s recent deviation from 
tradition, perhaps the greatest 
fallout from this decision is the press’ 
symbolic gesture of submission to 
the Trump administration.
It is a dangerous time for the 

media. Since his 2016 presidential 
campaign, Trump has demonstrated 
his inability to coexist peacefully 
with journalists who 
criticize 
the 
current 
administration. 
Not 
only has he publicly 
denounced major news 
outlets like CNN and 
The New York Times, 
severely compromising 
public 
trust 
in 
the 
media, but our president 
has gone as far as to 
threaten to eradicate 
press briefings entirely. 
Time and time again, he has shown 
a blatant disregard for the principles 
that are not only foundational to 
our nation’s Constitution but also 
essential to the preservation of a 
healthy democracy.

The WHCA was established in 
response to a growing fear regarding 
a lack of independence between the 
White House press corps and the 
government itself. The WHCA is 
an independent organization, and 
its annual dinner is meant to be a 
celebration of the freedom of speech 
and the press.
Virtually every president has 
issues with the press, but Trump’s 
tense relations with the media are 
unparalleled. Since the start of his 
term, Trump has skipped both 
WHCDs, making him the first 
president in 36 years who has not 
attended the event. Hasan Minhaj 
put it bluntly in his 2017 WHCD 
roast 
when 
he 
acknowledged 
Trump’s absence, stating “I think 
he’s in Pennsylvania because he 
can’t take a joke.”
Historically, 
the 
president 
has been a centerpiece of the 
dinner. His presence represents 
an important and foundational 
principle in this nation: The 

government 
will 
protect 
journalistic integrity and refrain 
from scrutiny or interference. 
In refusing to attend the event, 
Trump is not only breaking a 
decades-old tradition, but he is 
solidifying this administration’s 
continual unwillingness to respect 
an independent, free media.
At the center of this contentious 
decision to substitute a comedy 
roast for a history lesson is 
comedian Michelle Wolf who drew 
criticism for her controversial 
routine at the 2018 dinner. Despite 
Trump’s two-year-long boycott 
of the event, the WHCA’s recent 
announcement has prompted the 
president to reconsider, tweeting, 
“Good first step in comeback of 
a dying evening and tradition! 
Maybe I will go?”
The fact that the WHCA, 
an organization comprised of 
well-educated and experienced 
writers, cannot see the irony in 
its recent decision to forgo the 
comedy roast is a bit jarring. 
The WHCA may think by 
eradicating 
a 
controversial 
part 
of 
its 
annual 
dinner, 
it 
is 
mending 
a 
strained 
relationship with the current 
administration, but it is not. 
Getting rid of a long-held and 
important tradition simply to 
appease a president who “can’t 
take a joke” is not a compromise; 
it is a concession, and we should 
all be concerned. 
This is not the time to bow 
down to Trump’s demands. Now 
more than ever, it is essential 
that the press maintain their 
integrity and independence. The 
WHCD’s comedy roast may seem 
like a trivial concession in the 
grand scheme of things, but it is 
reflective of an important and 
growing threat to our nation’s 
First 
Amendment. 
The 
press 
cannot allow intimidation from 
the 
government 
to 
influence 
their actions, no matter how 
insignificant.
If the president of the United 
States won’t attend a dinner 
because he “can’t take a joke,” so 
be it. Carry on with the jokes.

A

lbion, 
Mich., 
is 
an 
underwhelming 
place 
for someone from Metro 
Detroit. Aside from the small — 
very small — private liberal arts 
college that bears the city’s name, 
there is not much else. Beyond 
Albion College’s campus, you will 
find rows of dilapidated houses 
with peeling paint. Driving through 
Albion, you get a sense that the city 
has seen much better days. In fact, 
if you drive through any number of 
Michigan cities, you get the same 
feeling. Detroit’s ongoing comeback 
story is a towering achievement for 
the state, but outside of the economic 
engines of southeast Michigan and 
Grand Rapids, the picture is not an 
optimistic one. Cities like Albion, 
Jackson and Monroe do not have 
their own comeback stories.
Albion is located in Calhoun 
County, which also contains Battle 
Creek, home of Kellogg’s Cereal. 
One of the 17 counties in Michigan 
where there are more prescriptions 
than there are people, Calhoun 
County has one of the highest rates 
of opioid prescriptions in the state. 
When the media covers the opioid 
epidemic, they depict working class 
folk in rural and rundown urban 
areas devoid of hope. It’s the same 
stereotypical habitat of Donald 
Trump voters, but that is another 
matter for another time.
Now, 
there 
is 
a 
common 
sentiment that criticizes American 
society for meeting the current drug 
crisis with empathy and concern: 
a stark contrast to the police 
crackdown and demonization of 
people of color during the crack 
epidemic of the 1980s and 1990s. 
There is no question that the racist 
War on Drugs has destroyed and 
continues to destroy Black and 
Latino lives and families. It is 
deeply unfortunate that the U.S. 
did not take the same approach 
with crack as we are taking with 
opioids, an approach rooted in 
public health instead of criminal 
justice. Ta-Nehisi Coates author 
of the bestseller “Between the 
World and Me”, is right when he 
speculates about how different the 
current opioid epidemic would be if 
society had invested in a substance 
abuse treatment infrastructure in 
30 years ago.
Similar 
to 
previous 
epidemics of crack cocaine and 
methamphetamine, 
the 
opioid 

epidemic hammers the working 
class and the poor. According to 
national 2016 data analyzed by the 
Kaiser Family Foundation, West 
Virginia has the highest rate of 
opioid overdose deaths (Michigan 
ranks 11th). There is not a lot of 
good data directly on the rates 
of opioid misuse in America, so I 
like to use prescription rates and 
overdose death rates as proxies. 
These proxies are far from perfect, 
though. Case in point, only a small 
portion of opioid users overdose 
and even fewer die as a result. Risk 
of death is also highly dependent on 
external factors such as whether the 
incredibly deadly opioid fentanyl 
has made it into the community.

The opioid epidemic should be 
viewed as a socioeconomic issue 
as well as a public health issue. The 
trend generally holds that opioids 
hit poorer communities harder. 
Moreover, treatment for addiction 
can be expensive and hard to access. 
For example, there are no specialty 
clinics that dispense methadone, 
one of the drugs used in medication-
assisted treatment, in the entire 
Upper Peninsula.
So, why do people of lower 
socioeconomic status shoulder a 
greater burden in this epidemic? 
After all, oxycodone has the same 
addictive potential whether it is 
taken by a billionaire or someone 
who is unemployed.
By and large, people who 
become addicted to opioids begin 
with opioids prescribed to them 
by a medical professional for 
pain. Working class people are at 
a much greater risk for pain than 
their 
middle- 
and 
upper-class 
counterparts.
A major cause of pain is 
workplace injury, and certain 
jobs are far more dangerous 
than others. A study out of 
Massachusetts, which has also 

been hit hard by opioids, found 
physically-intensive 
occupations 
like 
construction, 
fishing 
and 
material moving have a much higher 
risk of opioid misuse and overdose 
death. It may surprise some but 
fishing is the most dangerous job in 
America, according to data from the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics. Turns 
out cushy desk jobs result in a less 
painful life.
Another 
way 
people 
are 
exposed to opioids is after dental 
surgery such as tooth extractions 
and root canals. The fact that 
many Americans, 21.3 percent to 
be exact, have not seen a dentist 
in several years never ceases 
to amaze me. Oral health is an 
important part of overall health, 
but because dentistry is separate 
from medicine (the reason behind 
this is ridiculous), 33 percent of 
Americans do not have dental 
coverage. While we are lucky 
in Michigan to have expanded 
Medicaid, which covers dental care, 
lower income residents of states 
like Texas, Florida and Georgia do 
not have this option. Rotting teeth 
are extremely painful, but they 
are completely preventable, as are 
the surgeries needed to fix them. 
Dentists, love them or loathe them, 
have an important role to play in 
addressing the opioid epidemic.
I could go on and on about all 
the links between opioids and 
socioeconomic class, about how 
the stress of living paycheck to 
paycheck may lead people to 
self-medicate with heroin or 
painkillers, or how higher rates 
of obesity in poor communities 
leads to an epidemic of chronic 
lower back pain that is the 
reason many start opioids.
In the crack epidemic, society 
viewed those suffering with 
addiction as criminals. Today, 
the stereotype of communities 
hardest hit by opioids also 
includes the notion that these 
people are lazy and getting 
high because they are bored. 
Both are blatantly classist and 
far from the truth. Whether it 
is crack or opioids, America’s 
drug epidemics are reflections 
of 
socioeconomic 
inequality 
that plagues our nation.

M

ichael 
Bloomberg, 
the former mayor of 
New York City and 
potential Democratic presidential 
contender 
in 
2020, 
recently 
donated $1.8 billion (yes, billion 
with a b) to his alma mater, Johns 
Hopkins University. He wrote 
about the rationale for his donation 
in an Op-Ed published by The New 
York Times: he wants Hopkins 
to have a completely need-blind 
admissions process. Students will 
be accepted based on their merit, 
and not their ability to pay, which is 
unfortunately still a factor at many 
of the most prestigious universities 
in this country.
Though his desire to halt 
intergenerational 
poverty 
through need-blind admissions 
is commendable and inspiring, 
there exists controversy over his 
donation. In a Letter to the Editor 
of The New York Times, Kathleen 
McCartney, president of Smith 
College in Massachusetts, wrote 
how the money could have been 
better spent at a less prestigious 
university—one that was more 
widely available to low- and 
middle-income 
students. 
She 
mentioned how the City University 
of New York “propelled almost six 
times as many low-income students 
into the middle class and beyond 
as all eight Ivy League campuses, 
plus Duke, M.I.T., Stanford and 
Chicago, combined.”
Helaine Olen, a contributor 
for the New York Times, echoed 
this sentiment by writing in 
her piece that while Hopkins 
may be ethnically diverse (with 
25 percent of the student body 
African American and Hispanic) 
the university is less inclusive of 
those from lower rungs of the 
socioeconomic ladder. With only 
12 percent of Hopkins’ student 
body classified as first-generation 
college students, Olen suggests the 
university could be doing more to 
promote economic diversity.
The controversy surrounding 
Bloomberg’s donation reminded 
me of a powerful piece I read last 
year titled “The 9.9 Percent is the 
New American Aristocracy.” In it, 
Matthew Stewart details how the 
wealthiest 10 percent of American 

households (excluding the top 0.1 
percent because of their obscene 
amount of wealth) like to give off 
the impression that they’re a part 
of some meritocracy – that any 
individual from even the lowest 
socioeconomic background can 
work hard enough and make their 
way into the top 10 percent. This 
idea, however, could not be further 
from the truth.

Economic mobility in the land of 
opportunity is no longer a realistic 
expectation for those seeking to 
advance their financial position in 
this world. The children of the top 
decile settle down later in life near 
their starting point (as doctors, 
lawyers or senior vice presidents at 
a major corporation). This reality 
extends to children in the bottom 
decile too. It is intergenerational 
poverty that pulls these children 
right back to where they came 
from.
The wealthiest 10 percent of 
American 
households, 
Stewart 
asserts, have managed to secure the 
financial security (and prosperity) 
of their children through higher 
education. He writes “(t)he skin 
colors of the nation’s elite student 
bodies are more varied now, as are 
their genders, but their financial 
bones have calcified over the past 
30 years.”
Inequality is perpetuated in 
higher education through the use of 
legacy-admissions policies, which 
reward applicants whose parents 
attended the same university. In 
addition, acoording to Stewart 
private high schools serve as 
“affirmative-action programs for 
the wealthy” because “only 2.2 
percent of the nation’s students 
graduate 
from 
nonsectarian 

private high schools, and yet these 
graduates account for 26 percent of 
students at Harvard and 28 percent 
of students at Princeton.”
The lack of economic inclusivity 
at elite institutions extends beyond 
the Ivy League. Even the University 
of Michigan is affected, as only 
16 percent of Michigan’s student 
body is made up of students from 
the bottom 60 percent of earners, 
while nearly 10 percent of the 
student body comes from the top 1 
percent.
It 
turns 
out 
that 
this 
inequality in higher education 
is also perpetuated through 
the U.S. News college rankings. 
Colleges and universities are 
ranked (quite arbitrarily) on a 
host of factors—with one of great 
importance being the average 
test scores of its student body. In 
order to improve their ranking, 
colleges and universities are 
incentivized to admit only the 
best and brightest. The problem 
arises 
when 
you 
consider 
students from the top income 
bracket can score more than 130 
points higher on all portions of 
the SAT than their peers in the 
bottom bracket.
Bloomberg’s 
donation 
may 
make his alma mater’s admissions 
process 
need-blind, 
but 
that 
assumes the students from lower 
socioeconomic classes are viable 
contenders in the process. His 
donation does nothing for the high 
school students unable to prove 
their worth to the institution 
through high grades or test scores. 
 
While Bloomberg’s $1.8 billion 
will certainly have an impact 
on the economic diversity of 
Hopkins’ student body, the money 
will make but a small dent (which 
he admits) in the effort to halt 
intergenerational poverty in the 
United States. Making America 
the land of opportunity once 
again will require greater, more 
economically 
impartial 
access 
to higher education. It may also 
require 
restraining 
the 
New 
American Aristocracy.

WARNER BROS.

CHANEL

In Sept. of this year, Chanel 

released Boy de Chanel in Seoul, 
with plans to launch a global 
release in early 2019. Their 
inaugural line of men’s makeup 
is fairly pared down, with 
offerings of “tinted fluid” in (an 
abysmal) four different shades, 
an eyebrow pencil and a matte 
lip balm. Despite its humble 
catalogue, the announcement 
initially felt like a liberating step 
forward for a beauty industry 
that is becoming something of 
a microcosm for the erosion of 
gender norms. After a little bit 
of consideration, however, that 
foundation doesn’t set quite as 
evenly as one might think. Boy 
de Chanel is a definitive moment 
in 
normalizing 
the 
use 
of 

makeup for people who present 
masculinely, but it is also a cry to 
reinforce the gender binary in a 
realm already laden with it.

Chanel wields decades of 

unmatched multinational cache, 
and the power to set standards 
in its respective trades. Earlier 
this 
year, 
it 
exposed 
the 

underpinnings of its tweed box 

jacket, revealing a streamlined 
overview of its sales in 2017 for 
the first time in over a century. 
The lining can stand up to its 
finely woven shell — clocking in 
at almost $10 billion in annual 
revenue, it continues to dominate 
markets as a luxury brand, 
outselling 
more 
outwardly 

progressive names like Gucci, 
Louis Vuitton and Dior. For a 
venerable force in fashion that 
can, from a numbers standpoint, 
walk its talk better than any of 
its competitors, it’s a mark of 
something when it engages with 
a social movement that was once 
considered deviant, or at least 
unconventional. Whether or not 
that engagement is productive is 
a different conversation. 

The gendered designation of 

cosmetics is a perennial issue 
that is varied widely depending 
on 
its 
cultural 
context. 

Historically speaking, its usage 
of cosmetics was associated 
more with class than it was 
with gender. In aristocratic 
systems, most notably Imperial 
European systems in the 17th 
and 18th centuries, those with 
inherited power would wear 
white powder, wigs and rouge 
as a visual assertion of their 

status. Ancient Roman nobles 
would paint their nails with the 
blood and fat of pigs for similar 
reasons; makeup was a way 
of distinguishing oneself as a 
member of a privileged group. 
Towards the end of the 19th 
century, however, a socially 
conservative wave in religion, 
championed by Queen Victoria, 
along with the development of 
psychology and the study of sex, 
concurrently placed cosmetics 
at the cross-section of vanity 
and a strict sense of devalued 
femininity. The modern beauty 
industry, despite the capitalist 
— duh — concept of being able to 
make more money marketing a 
product to a range of markets as 
opposed to one, still very much 
adheres to and enforces these 
norms.

Sexology 
and 
psychiatry 

were the two defining hands 
in how society has viewed 
and continues to view gender. 
Inversion theory, one of the 
earliest conceptions of same-
sex sexuality, was an attempt 
to put words to and legitimize 
an identity that, until then, was 
only thought of as a form of 
deviant behavior and was often 
swept under the rug. While 

SAM KREMKE

For the Daily

Makeup is de-gendered

STYLE NOTEBOOK

noble in its cause, it conflated 
gender expression and roles with 
sexuality and failed to separate 
societal notions of same-sex 
sexuality 
from 
pederasty. 

Sexual inversion theory and 
the work of early psychiatrists 
(see: 
Sigmund 
Freud) 
also 

placed a lot of emphasis on the 
environmental 
factors 
that 

might shape sexuality.

The culmination of religious 

conservatism and conjectures 
from social scientists of that 
era resulted in the idea that (A) 
same-sex sexuality and gender 
expression that deviated from 
what was considered “standard” 
were the same thing, (B) these 
behaviors were not inherent 
and, therefore, either a set of 
reversible choices or a result 
of something that went wrong 
during childhood and (C) they 
were indicative of sickness, 
sexual perversion and predation 
of the highest order. The stigma 
placed on occupying any space 
on the gender or sexual spectrum 
that wasn’t rigidly adherent to 
the cis-heteronormative status 
quo was subjective and context 
dependent (as it continues to 
be), but could be and often was 
absolutely dire. Notions of what 
is meant to be a man and what 
it meant to be a woman at this 
time were effectively under 
the purview of medicine, law 
and religion — and the beauty 
industry marketed its wares 
accordingly.

Rigid gender expectations 

still exist, but they slowly 
began to erode over the course 
of the 20th century. The first 
glint of expressive freedom 
in America’s eye was during 
Prohibition, when many urban 
speakeasies were also places 
with an anything-goes policy. 
Harlem 
ballroom 
culture 

exploded in popularity at this 
time, and artists au courant 
such as Marcel Duchamp did 
not shy away from poking 
fun at gender norms in their 
work (Duchamp himself very 
famously had a drag persona 
called Rrose Selavy). Drag’s 
relevance in the mainstream 
consciousness grew over the 
course of the 20th century and 
played a part in deconstructing 
societal expectations by both 
poking 
fun 
at 
unrealistic 

gendered 
expectations 
and 

celebrating 
femininity 
and 

freedom of expression. Part of 
the reason that drag was able to 
survive in spite of such blatant 
disregard for an institutionally 
backed binary was that it was 
considered 
performance 
art. 

While it still wasn’t treated with 
the same level of regard as other 
mediums due to its association 
with gay culture, it created a 
space in which the concept of a 
man throwing on a little pressed 
powder wasn’t so alien. 

Cinema’s 
march 
to 

ubiquity as the most popular 
form 
of 
entertainment 
also 

re-indoctrinated the concept 
of the idealized male. It was no 
secret that the likes of James 
Dean and Cary Grant wore 
foundation on screen, and while 
other masculine attributes were 
reinforced by this medium, 
gliding in the background of 
“washing your face makes you 
gay” culture was an aesthetic 
standard that could be achieved 
by wearing makeup. On the 
other end of the spectrum, 
stage performers, who were 
undoubtedly 
influenced 
by 

drag queens and attitude shifts 
brought on by the gay liberation 
and feminist movements of the 
late ’60s and early ’70s, blew the 
lid off of what the mainstream 
consumer could expect to see 
from a visual standpoint. 

An entirely separate online 

drawl belongs to the influence 
that 
David 
Bowie, 
Prince, 

Siouxsie Sioux, Boy George 
and their ilk had on creative 
expression. 
Punk, 
glam-rock 

and other movements of the 
time spawned artists that went 
beyond enhancing their own 
features or smearing kohl in 
their waterline for a touch 
of 
externalized 
melancholy. 

Pigment became a vehicle to 
forge new identities that could 
change over time. 

Stage personas championed 

by 
these 
idols 
were 
about 

exploration 
in 
every 
sense, 

often blowing the roof off of 
gendered norms and creating 
something entirely alien. They 
were about materializing ideas 
and recovering a sense of agency 
over what people can present to 
the world around them. Though 
the concepts put forward by 
wildly 
famous 
artists 
were 

tangental at best to the general 
public, 
their 
popularity 

indicated that people were ready 
to embrace the idea that visual 
communication is not attached 
to sex or gender identity. Though 
it was motivated by rebellion to 
his record label, Prince briefly 
changing his name to a symbol 
that 
fused 
gender 
together 

at the height of his fame best 
encapsulates the collective work 
done by entertainers of the 20th 
century.

Entertainment 
and 
other 

forms 
of 
media 
are 
both 

institutions of influence and 
societal barometers when it 
comes to group dynamics like 
representation, 
stigma 
and 

realms of acceptability. Time’s 
arrow has marched forward into 
the era of information, in which 
technology has both redefined 
media and agents of influence 
to mean almost anything and 
allowed it to act much more 
quickly. People with access 
to the internet are flooded 
with content on a daily basis 
and the visibility that content 
has created has been a huge 
catalyst for the expansion of 
what’s considered “normal.” As 
social networking has become a 

platform for people to develop 
their own personas and have a 
greater impact on normalization, 
it has enabled brands and other 
organizations to function in the 
same way — both influencing 
and tailoring their products and 
brand identity according to their 
interactions with consumers. 

Beauty lines like Milk, Fenty 

and GCDS have facilitated a 
wave of inclusivity as well as 
interaction between industry 
and the individual, reposting 
selfies they’ve been tagged in 
and showcasing MUAs across 
the gender spectrum. Queer-
centric Fluide wears their heart 
on their sleeve — proclaiming 
themselves as a “celebration 
of kinship, love and queer 
glamour,” reflecting that in the 
models they work with and the 
organizations they give back 
to. Brands having the agency 
to interact with individuals 
at an immediate level and act 
as one themselves, their core 
philosophy and what they do 
as 
companies 
is 
becoming 

more and more central to their 
success. The words and actions 
of a company’s founders, as 
well as those that are given the 
authority to represent it, are 
now paramount — companies 
need to be transparent and 
consistently incorporate their 
morality into what they do. 

The 
declining 
reign 
of 

gendered constructs indicate 
that 
inviting 
all 
creatures 

to experiment with you is a 
winning mantra for cosmetic 
brands. 
As 
GCDS 
founder, 

Giuliano Calza, put it for The 
Flow 
House, 
“Everyone 
is 

battling for gender equality and 
beauty diversity. I just consider 
it necessary and something that 
should already exist, something 
that should be guaranteed. If 
you handle it normally, everyone 
will think it’s normal. That’s 
why I try to push for beauty 
and unconventional ideas in my 
communication.”

Quality of the product, the 

standards of beauty you set and 
the people you choose to support 
ultimately manifest themselves 
in the groups that will spend 
with you, or whether they will 
spend at all.

Beauty lines from luxury 

giants like Chanel have their 
reputation 
to 
rely 
on, 
but 

their respective social market 
economy is a rapidly expanding 
current that will move and 
shift without regard to it. 
Symbolizing opulence isn’t a 
big enough balance to cover a 
dusty move like taking the same 
formulas and repackaging them 
to appeal to fragile masculinity. 
Boy de Chanel symbolizes an 
earnest effort to democratize 
cosmetics, but as one of the 
premier purveyors of face paint, 
it would carry a lot of weight 
if Chanel’s focus was a little 
bit less “Men Are from Mars, 
Women Are from Venus.”

The genre-blending ‘Black 
Christmas’ has an impact

FILM NOTEBOOK

Here’s the issue. I’m among 

the most avid horror fans I 
know, and the genre’s most 
classic, scariest features don’t 
terrify me one bit. In particular, 
the ’70s can be considered as a 
sort of fertile breeding ground 
for new horror ideas. Not all of 
them were widely adopted into 
the popular consciousness, but 
they were certainly creative. 
Now, many of these films are 
idolized, not only as the most 
successful, but as the scariest 
horror can be. 

Whether I’m watching “Texas 

Chainsaw Massacre,” “The Last 
House on the Left” or even 
one of my personal favorites, 
“Halloween,” I am consistently 
more interested in the craft than 
I am strictly terrified. The body 
horror of “The Exorcist” and 
the ghostly apparitions of “The 
Amityville Horror” play for 
laughs, not scares. These films, 
for all their fearless innovation, 
have aged far from gracefully.

And I’m not the only one 

who feels this way. Whenever 
I suggest watching a horror 
movie with friends, the titles 
that come to the top of our list 
are rarely older than 15 years 
(with the notable exception of 
“Silence of the Lambs”). Horror, 
for all of the wonderful, electric, 
introspective 
things 
it 
has 

meant to me, is also ephemeral 
in its generational impact. Of 
course, there is an exception to 
all these generalizations about 
a decade of horror movies: 
1974’s “Black Christmas.” It 
is a film that not only stays 
resoundingly unsettling to this 
day, but is a lost horror gem that 

institutionalized myriad slasher 
tropes. 

“Black Christmas” follows 

two nights at a sorority house 
during the holiday break. We 
can hear nothing but faint 
cheerful voices from within 
the house and unsteady, ragged 
breathing from a masked lurker 
right outside. The ground is 
snowy, the air is frigid and the 
stalker prowls around without 
any clear purpose. That’s why 
he’s so frightening. Whether 
for personal vendetta or gleeful 
masochism, he could be stalking 
the girls inside for any number 
of reasons or none at all.

Before 
“Black 
Christmas,” 

horror had rarely placed a 
camera in an attacker’s point of 
view. Every murder that happens 
doesn’t feel as detached and 
punishing as much cinematic 
violence does. The brutality 
is kinetic and impossible to 
look away from because we as 
viewers seem, on some level, 
to partake in the stabbing and 
the strangling. More than this, 
there is a sense of inevitability 
to the stalker’s rampage, a 
feeling that the audience is 
not only responsible for his 
aggression but also helpless 
to resist it. Three features 
of “Black Christmas” — the 
panting breathing, POV mask 
shots and obscene phone calls to 
foreshadow the killer’s rampage 
— were borrowed by none other 
than “Halloween” three years 
later. From there, they took off 
to horror and thriller flicks for 
years afterword.

One of the few elements of 

“Black Christmas” that did not 
deeply pervade the parade of 
serial killer stories of the ’80s is 
probably one that has aged the 
best. These slasher films almost 

always had a “final girl,” which 
turned into an archetype of 
sexual punishment that killed 
off the promiscuous and only 
allowed the virginal to survive. 
However, “Black Christmas,” 
even 
in 
1974, 
transcended 

this dry and sanctimonious 
stereotype. 
In 
fact, 
its 

protagonist Jess is pregnant 
during the events of the film. 
She is an indelible character and 
among my favorites in horror, 
not because she follows common 
horror archetypes, but because 
she defies them and acts only on 
her own agency. 

Aside from the film’s modest 

influence 
on 
whole 
horror 

subgenre, it holds up well today 
for one reason: It’s terrifying. 
It’s one of the few older horror 
movies that provoked me to 
scream, to jump back in my 
seat and to peek at the screen 
only 
through 
interlocked 

fingers. “Black Christmas” is 
unrelentingly tense, a wound 
machine 
that 
threatens 
to 

implode at any given moment. But 
to label the movie as a slow-burn 
would be an oversimplification. 
“Black 
Christmas” 
upholds 

its promise for violence with 
murder 
sequences 
that 
are 

breaktaking in their ambition 
and unforgettable in their gore. 

The greatest thing about 

“Black Christmas?” It is both 
a Halloween and a Christmas 
movie. 
That 
means 
it 
is 

acceptable to watch from Oct. 
to Dec. — like right now! If 
you’re like me, and have never 
been frightened by older horror 
movies, 
I 
can’t 
recommend 

this enough. If you’re also 
comfortably into the holiday 
season but can’t resist some 
decent scares, this is more than 
ideal.

This past weekend, I went 

to see the Wheelhouse Theater 
Company’s 
revival 
of 
Kurt 

Vonnegut’s 
“Happy 
Birthday, 

Wanda June” in New York City. I 
am a huge fan of Vonnegut’s books 
and I wanted to see if Vonnegut’s 
unique writing style would transfer 
well to the stage. And transfer it 
did, as the play was filled with 
obscure 1970s cultural references 
and Vonnegut’s signature dark, 
absurdist humor.

As I left the play, I began to 

piece apart my thoughts on the 
work. I had definitely enjoyed the 
play, but I was also very confused, 
struggling to understand both 
the intricacies of the plot and the 
meaning of the work itself. I would 
definitely recommend the work to 
a friend, but I’m not sure if I could 
ever summarize for anyone what 
happened in the work.

I realized that I almost enjoyed 

the play because it was confusing — 
the complexity and irregularity of 
the plot forcing me to concentrate 
and engage more with the work. 
It had jumped between memories 
and actual events, between Heaven 
and Earth. It jumped all over the 
place, and much of my energy as 
an audience member was spent on 
keeping up.

The work was also thematically 

ambiguous. I know it focused on 
hypermasculinity and death. It 
juxtaposed the horror we express 
over car accidents with the 
excitement and awe we express 
over wartime deaths caused by 
American 
soldiers, 
but 
these 

themes weren’t developed. They 
were frequent, recurrent aspects 
of the plot, but they never moved 
past that.

This wasn’t my first experience 

with complexity on the stage. 
If anything, this play was less 
abstract than some other works 
I am familiar with. Compared 
to many of Samuel Beckett’s 
plays, for example, this play 
was accessible on the surface. 
Conversations between characters 
flowed logically and characters’ 
motivations 
and 
emotions 

were frequently made explicit. 
Compared to Tony Kushner’s 
“Angels in America,” for example, 
this play followed a small cast of 
six in a single-room set.

And 
this 
wasn’t 
my 
first 

experience with complexity in 
Vonnegut’s work. Compared to 
“The Sirens of Titan,” the first 
Vonnegut novel I read, this work 
was remarkably static. It never 
moved to any unfamiliar planets or 
dealt with any fictitious, alienistic 
creatures. What then, I asked 
myself, was making this work so 
difficult for me to fully understand?

“Happy 
Birthday, 
Wanda 

June,” 
I 
eventually 
realized, 

refuses to conform to the linear 
conception of time inherent to 
the performing arts. Almost all 
works of performance art involve 
development over the course of 
time — much as our lives inevitably 
evolve over time, so do works 
of performance art. In works of 
theater, this involves characters 

that change or refuse to change as 
the world around them changes as 
well.

Yet Vonnegut specifically avoids 

this linear transformation. None of 
the characters in the play develop, 
they only react to the outside forces 
that bring them together and 
pull them apart. The work darts 

between memories and the present 
without any noticeable changes 
occuring in any of the characters. 
And though the viewer can easily 
understand this concept on the 
surface, larger thematic meaning 
behind this stasis gets lost behind 
the alinear intricacies of the plot.

This alinear conception of time 

is not new to Vonnegut. He does 
this frequently in his novels to 
great success. In “Slaughterhouse-
Five,” for example, events do 
not happen chronologically and 
characters profess not to believe in 
chronological conceptions of time. 
“It is just an illusion we have here 
on earth,” says the main character 
at one point, “that one moment 
follows another one, like beads on 
a string, and that once a moment is 
gone it is gone forever.”

Others 
artists 
have 
taken 

inspiration from Vonnegut in 
applying this structural alinearity 
to 
performance 
art. 
Andrew 

Norman, for example, composed 
his orchestral work “Unstuck” 
based on the concept of time laid 
out 
in 
“Slaughterhouse-Five.” 

When I first discovered this 
piece, I was fascinated by how 
it challenged my perception of 
time — I knew the recording of 
the piece lasted nine minutes and 
33 seconds on YouTube though I 
couldn’t imagine that I had only 
been listening for around nine and 
a half minutes.

Norman achieves this effect 

by jumping between disparate 
musical ideas without transitional 
material. He constantly varies 
the tempo and gestural pacing of 
his ideas, preventing the listener 
from 
becoming 
comfortable 

with any specific conception of 
time. He also carefully develops 
the relationships between ideas 
throughout the piece without 
developing the ideas themselves.

The result is jagged and complex, 

violating the steady, tempo-based 
conception of time endemic to 
contemporary orchestral music. 
It is an incredibly complex piece 
to fully understand even as it 
is an incredibly simple piece to 
consume on the surface. I believe 
that I could listen to the piece for 
months without ever finding it to 

be predictable or routine.

Another example of an alinear 

conception of time that I like is 
Christopher Nolan’s “Memento.” 
For those unfamiliar with the 
movie, it follows main character 
Leonard Shelby as he investigates 
the murder of his wife. Shelby 
suffers from anterograde amnesia, 
the inability to form new memories, 
and he resorts to tattooing himself 
to maintain some memory of his 
investigation as it progresses.

In the beginning, this non-

chronological 
structure 
is 

extremely confusing. Events are 
being portrayed in black-and-
white and in color — two separate 
plot lines that don’t seem to 
connect. As the movie progresses, 
however, the structure of the 
movie slowly comes into focus: The 
black-and-white footage depicts 
events chronologically while the 
color footage depicts events in 
reverse chronologically.

As with the other alinear works, 

this proves to be extremely off-
putting 
to 
first-time 
viewers. 

To obsessive viewers like me, 
however, it creates ambiguities 
that leave the work open to endless 
analysis.

So what makes these works 

successful 
even 
as 
“Happy 

Birthday, Wanda June” fails? 
What makes some alinear works 
successful and others confusingly 
unsuccessful? 
What 
defining 

feature separates the good alinear 
works from the bad?

Alinear conceptions of time, 

I realized, are only successful 
when they still exist within the 
confines 
of 
larger 
structural 

linearity. To put it in simpler terms, 
alinear conceptions of time only 
work when contrasted against 
linear structures of long-term 
development.

The performing arts, after all, 

are confined and defined by time. 
There is something beautiful, I 
find, in the fragile impermanence 
of these artforms — they exist 
over the course of an hour or two; 
they must be experienced over 
the course of an evening. The best 
alinear art creates connections 
between disparate moments in 
time, allowing for development 
to take place over the course of 
a work though time may not be 
contributing to this development.

And in this regard, “Happy 

Birthday, Wanda June” failed to 
deliver. I felt no different leaving 
the theater than I did after 
witnessing the first scene. The 
entire play was a wash of individual 
scenes 
with 
no 
overarching 

concept — I left the play noting no 
overall development that extended 
beyond any individual scene. And 
without this development, the 
work failed to move beyond the 
realm of the absurd to the realm 
of the powerful. And this, after all, 
is the ultimate goal of every work 
of art — to present some aspect 
of the human condition that we 
as audience members can relate 
to, allowing us to come to new 
realizations as we reflect on the 
lives of others.

VS lacks body diversity

STYLE NOTEBOOK

ABC

Each year as Nov. rolls around, 

the entertainment and fashion 
industry begin to buzz with 
chatter of the much anticipated 
Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show. 
Over the years, the annual 
show has been characterized 
as a night filled with glamour, 
beauty, confidence and gorgeous 
pieces of lingerie. However, the 
show is also synonymous with 
advocating the perfect, dream-
worthy bodies of its models, be it 
the original Angel Adriana Lima 
or rising stars such as Kelsey 
Merritt and Sui He. While 
Victoria’s Secret prides itself 
in having changed over time 
and increasing the diversity 
of 
cultures 
represented 
on 

the ramp, one aspect remains 
a constant: the body types. 
Recently, especially after this 
year’s fashion show on Nov. 8, 
Victoria’s Secret has garnered 
immense criticism for not being 
more body positive and for its 
lack of size diversity.

The Victoria’s Secret Fashion 

Show is known for its rigorous 
selection process of the 60 or 
so women who will take the 
stage, but all of them share the 
same body with their slender 
thighs, 
flat 
stomachs 
and 

muscles toned to perfection. 
They have a body that most, if 
not all, women envy and desire 
at some point or another in their 
lives. Every single one of these 
models 
works 
tremendously 

hard 
towards 
maintaining 

herself, and there is nothing 
wrong with that, but the issue 
lies in the company’s resistance 
towards inclusivity. For while 
having Gigi Hadid or Jasmine 
Tookes walk the show is a sight 
to see and builds the exclusive 
image of the brand as one that is 
desired by all, it also propagates 
the unhealthy thinking that 
only thin can be beautiful and 
sexy. As a result, it continues to 
feed the growing insecurities 
of women and especially young 
adults, including so many of us, 
across the world, irrespective of 
whether we are already thin or 
not.

The constant reiteration and 

glamification of a particular 
size by the fashion industry 
sends many of us thinking that 

we will never be good enough 
if we don’t have a 24-inch 
waist or a thigh gap. This line 
of thinking is what is putting 
our generation and those in 
the future at a higher risk of 
suffering from eating and body 
image disorders, and companies 
such as Victoria’s Secret are 
not helping. Furthermore, the 
build-up to the show is equally 
extreme due to the social 
media presence of the brand. 
Interviews and videos of the 
models 
outline 
the 
intense 

regime of multiple workouts 
in a day and limited diets that 
they engage in to reach Angel 
status. But they do not caution 
the risks that are associated 
with obsessing over one’s body 
type, nor do they stress the 
importance of accepting your 
own body.

My complaint with Victoria’s 

Secret is not that they are 
casting women of a particular 
size. Instead, my issue is that 
they are not casting women 
of other sizes. It is not an an 
either/or situation, because one 
woman should feel as good and 
confident in what she wears as 
any other. As a business student, 
I acknowledge that at the end 
of the day, Victoria’s Secret is 
focusing on the bottom line, 
wanting to earn the highest 
possible profits. If this mold 
of their fashion show works 
and brings them more money, 
then there is no reason for the 
firm to change from a business 
standpoint. However, the famed 
reputation of the company and 
its leading position comes with 
a certain moral responsibility 
to fairly represent its consumer 
base, which is not limited to 
those who meet what are often 
unrealistic 
body 
standards. 

Victoria’s 
Secret 
needs 
to 

acknowledge that there is a 
problem, and if they do want 
women of all sizes to shop at 
Victoria’s Secret, then it is high 
time that their actions reflect 
that.

However, the tragedy is that 

the issue runs much deeper 
than just a single fashion show 
held each year. The truth of the 
matter is that there are so many 
brands apart from Victoria’s 
Secret 
that 
simply 
do 
not 

produce garments larger than 
a particular size, inadvertently 
telling many women that they 

are not wanted. Some brands 
like 
Brandy 
Melville 
only 

produce clothes of a single size 
which, too, is limited to an 
extra-small or a small at the 
most. Such conscious decisions 
tend to have adverse effects on 
the mental health of young girls, 
especially when these brands 
are the ones that are perceived 
as popular due to being worn 
and promoted by influencers 
who the girls look up to and 
emulate.

The ratio of companies that 

are body positive to those that 
are not is both astounding 
and saddening, but being body 
positive does not simply mean 
having a “plus size” section. 
Rather, this sense of inclusivity 
needs 
to 
be 
demonstrated 

through each aspect of the 
brand, be it their marketing 
strategy or even the pricing of 
products. Often, in many stores, 
like Banana Republic, sizes 
apart from “regular” tend to 
be more expensive and hence 
reduce accessibility for so many 
consumers.

Body positivity has come 

a long way with change that 
is now visible. Fashion icons 
such as Ashley Graham and 
Tess Holliday are embracing 
their curves, becoming ultra-
successful 
in 
the 
fashion 

industry and inspiring millions 
along the way. Brands like 
Aerie 
have 
recognized 
the 

importance of this movement 
and have focused on creating 
more inclusive campaigns in 
terms of cultures, sizes and even 
disabilities.

But is this enough? The 

reason I ask is that there still 
exists a distinct misalignment 
between the views of the fashion 
industry and its audience — but 
companies are not the only 
ones to blame. Brands seek to 
deliver and fulfill demands, 
and hence the lack of diversity 
is the result of the continual 
approval given to smaller sizes 
while reprimanding others that 
don’t fit the bill. As a society, 
we have started the journey 
toward 
true 
inclusivity 
in 

some measure, but need to yet 
encourage greater love for our 
own bodies irrespective of the 
size, color or anything else for 
that matter. On the other hand, 
brands need to move with time 
and realize that in the current 

PRIYDARSHINI GOUTHI

climate, consumers are not 
going to continue accepting 
what comes their way and will 
demand 
change. 
Victoria’s 

Secret has been seeing a decline 
in financial performance in 
recent years, and with CEO Jan 
Singer resigning after this year’s 
fashion show following chief 
marketing officer Ed Razek’s 
rather uninformed comments 
on how “No one had any interest 
in it, still don’t” when referring 

to the plus size lingerie market, 
it is safe to say that the brand 
has taken a hit. 

The 
fashion 
industry 

continues to be one of the most 
fast-paced and evolving global 
communities that is filled with 
talent of all kinds, but it isn’t 
perfect. As young adults who 
are now the prime market of the 
industry, the responsibility to 
call out what’s missing and push 
for change 
falls onto us. 

I don’t mean that we need to 
boycott brands or stop shopping 
at every store that isn’t equally 
diverse, but we do need to be 
more aware and at least address 
the issue at hand. We could 
do this by speaking out in any 
form, be it through social media 
or 
initiating 
conversations 

about the problems the industry 
faces, immaterial of whether we 
are personally affected by them 
or not.

Michigan dominant in 84-67 win over UNC

Roy Williams stood in front 
of a crowd of media, castigating 
both his team and himself. It 
was about 11:40 on Wednesday 
night, and North Carolina had 
just met Michigan — the type of 
team that can drive coaches to 
this sort of frustration.
“Guys, I got no positive 
things,” the Tar Heels’ coach 
said. “If you want some positive 
things, 
you 
better 
go 
find 
somebody on the street.
“... I’ve coached for 31 years. 
Right now, my coaching sucks.”
A 
little 
later, 
it 
was 
Wolverines’ John Beilein at the 
podium, singing a different tune.
“That’s one of the biggest 
compliments I’ve ever had,” 
Beilein said, disposition sunny. 
“... It’s not like we’re trying 
to frustrate you. We’re trying 
to keep people from scoring 
baskets.”
That they did — and about as 
well as you could ask, holding 
No. 11 North Carolina (6-2) 
nearly 30 points below its season 
average, as No. 7 Michigan (7-0) 
engineered a domineering 84-67 
win.
It was the type of win that 
makes you think the Wolverines 
can contend for a national 
title, and when they opened 
the second half by jumping out 
to a double-digit lead — a lob 
from junior point guard Zavier 
Simpson to junior center Jon 
Teske 
prompting 
a 
timeout 
from Williams — Crisler Center 
sounded like the home of a 
national contender.
On the other end of that 
timeout, Michigan started to 
break the game open, leading 
into the under-16 timeout with 
another 
Teske 
dunk. 
After 
Simpson missed a layup a couple 
minutes later, redshirt junior 
Charles 
Matthews 
slammed 
it back home for an and-one, 
sending the crowd — and the 
Wolverines’ 
bench 
— 
into 
hysterics and bringing the lead 

to 14.
When North Carolina’s Leaky 
Black tried a driving layup, 
Matthews put an exclamation 
mark on the night, blocking the 
ball past the cameramen seated 
along 
the 
baseline, 
flexing 
for the cameras and shouting 
amidst a sea of noise.
“Charles has possessed the 
defense,” Beilein said. “He and 
Zavier are the most driven 
defensive 
players 
I’ve 
ever 
coached. This is what they want 
to do. And the offense is sort of 
residual out of it.”
Just 
after 
the 
12-minute 
mark, sophomore guard Jordan 
Poole nailed a corner 3-pointer, 
bringing the lead to 20, enough 
to stave off North Carolina’s 
attempt at a late comeback.
The Tar Heels managed to 
cut the lead to 11 with 5:29 to 
go after Kenny Williams hit 
two straight 3-pointers. But 
after another Matthews triple, 
followed by four straight points 
from freshman forward Ignas 

Brazdeikis, the Tar Heels’ hopes 
were right back where they had 
started.
This was a game that — at one 
point — the visiting team led 
21-11, looking to coast. But after 
Simpson quelled an early 8-0 
North Carolina run with a steal 
in the backcourt and subsequent 
layup, Michigan settled in.
Immediately 
following, 
freshman 
forward 
Ignas 
Brazdeikis led a 9-0 run for the 
Wolverines, hitting a 3-pointer 
and notching an and-one after 
the under-12 timeout. Shortly 
after, Eli Brooks put Michigan 
in front, 22-21, with a 3-pointer 
of his own.
Right before halftime, the 
Wolverines broke a tie after 
Simpson managed to pass his 
way out of a half-court trap, the 
ball eventually finding Charles 
Matthews for an open 3-pointer. 
Poole 
followed 
that 
with 
another three — this one just 
before the buzzer — after a loose 
ball sent Jon Teske sprawling 

on the floor in a mad scramble, 
coming up with the basketball 
to give Michigan a four-point 
halftime lead.
“7-foot-1 guys don’t go and get 
that ball like that,” Beilein said. 
“So he didn’t shoot the ball well, 
didn’t shoot foul (shots) well — 
he’s such a huge presence for us, 
defensively.”
That 
momentum 
carried 
into the second half, Poole 
providing the nail in the coffin 
with a stepback 3-pointer, and 
the Wolverines leaving Crisler 
Center with no doubt about 
where they stand — in both the 
Big Ten and the national title 
picture.
“It just felt really good, but 
we can’t dwell on this victory,” 
Brazdeikis said. “This is just a 
November win for us, it’s only 
the beginning. It’s a big mark 
for us, it shows us where we’re 
at, but we need to continue to 
improve.”
For a November win, it makes 
quite a statement.

Brazdeikis provides momentum shift in win

Ignas Brazdeikis sat on the 
bench, 
watching 
Michigan’s 
sluggish offense fall in a hole to 
North Carolina.
After getting whistled for a foul 
just three minutes into the game, 
the freshman forward came out. 
Without 
their 
leading 
scorer 
on the 
season, 
the 
Wolverines 
struggled to find a 
rhythm.
“I told him, 
‘You can’t make 
fouls 
like 
that 
early in the game, 
you know how 
much it means 
to this team,’ ” 
said redshirt junior wing Charles 
Matthews. “ ‘You’re a freshman, 
but your contribution to the team 
is huge and we need you on the 
floor.’ ”
Brazdeikis learned from his 
freshman mistake and resolved to 

make up for it. Five minutes later 
— with Michigan down by eight to 
the Tar Heels on an 8-0 run — he 
checked back in.
“I made that foul and it was 
kind of a mistake,” Brazdeikis 
said. “So I was like, ‘As soon as I 
get back in, I need to make some 
plays, be aggressive, get back in 
the groove of the game.’
“ … I’ll take my 
leg off if I have to 
… I’m gonna do 
whatever it takes 
to win the game.”
He made good 
on that promise.
After a layup 
cut 
North 
Carolina’s 
lead 
to six, Brazdeikis 
collected 
a 
turnover off a bad 
pass and drove down the court for 
a layup and-one.
Moments later, Brazdeikis once 
again got the ball following an 
empty possession from the Tar 
Heels and a Wolverine defensive 
rebound, and he nailed a triple to 

cut the deficit to two.
And on the next possession, 
he grabbed a defensive rebound 
that set up another 3-pointer by 
sophomore guard Eli Brooks.
One minute and 20 seconds 
after 
re-entering 
the 
game, 
Brazdeikis had almost single-
handedly 
turned 
a 
six-point 
deficit into a one-point lead. The 
ensuing 17-2 run 
— 
including 
another 
layup 
from 
Brazdeikis 
— 
extended 
Michigan’s lead to 
five.
“We 
just 
started 
to 
hit 
shots, 
started 
to make plays,” 
Brazdeikis 
said. 
“I felt like early 
on we were kinda missing shots 
that we usually make, missing 
free throws, so I felt like when I 
got back in, I made a couple plays 
and then everything just started 
rolling from there.”
Brazdeikis’ run was a wake-

up call for the offense, which 
scored 45 points in the second 
half en route to an 84-67 win. 
Appropriately, Brazdeikis scored 
the Wolverines’ first points of 
the second half on an open layup 
under the basket. By then, Crisler 
Center was rocking and Michigan 
was rolling.
“I don’t think he’s in awe,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 
John 
Beilein. 
“He’s 
never played in 
an environment 
like 
that 
and 
he’s not in awe 
of any of that. 
He just comes 
in and performs 
through it.”
Brazdeikis 
finished 
with 
24 points on the night — a season 
(and career) high — proving that 
for him, no stage was truly too big.
But it was those six points 
halfway through the first half that 
served as a wake-up call, just when 
the Wolverines needed it most.

Wolverines filling 
roles when needed

Ask anyone. Ask Michigan 
coach Mel Pearson.
Odds 
are, 
they 
haven’t 
noticed a small habit Jake 
Slaker picked up since the 
start of the year.
A 
season 
prior, 
former 
Wolverine 
Tony 
Calderone 
took on the leadership role as a 
captain. He had been credited 
with sparking a fire under the 
Michigan hockey team after a 
film session that fueled a late-
season push to the postseason 
— a journey that ended in a 
Frozen Four appearance.
But it was a smaller notion, 
unnoticed by many, that might 
define that role better. 
Before every 
game, 
there’s 
a brief period 
when 
the 
players are let 
loose 
on 
the 
ice to get some 
practice 
shots 
in. Goaltenders 
mark 
their 
place at the net, 
scraping 
the 
ice around the 
crease. Skaters 
line up and shoot at the net. 
The pucks build up.
It gets to a point where 
there’s only one or two pucks 
left to shoot around with 
before it’s time to empty the 
net. And that’s where the 
veterans of the team clear it.
“You’re not going to see 
many younger guys stepping 
in and (emptying the net),” 
Slaker said. “It’s usually an 
older guy, usually a leader of 
the team.”
Back then, it was Calderone. 
This year? Slaker stepped up 
to the plate.
“I think it’s just one of those 
things where Tony was our 
captain, and he did it, and no 
one really stepped up so I just 
said I would 
really do it,” 
Slaker 
said. 
“So it was just 
one of those 
things 
where 
I just decided 
and ended up 
doing it. And 
I shoot for the 
goalies at the 
beginning 
of 
the game too, 
so I just kinda went along with 
it.”
It’s just another example of 
filling a role that needs to be 
filled, no matter how big or 
small. An action that Pearson 
thought Michigan had done 
well in its Friday matchup 
against Wisconsin.
The team found out close 
to puck drop that Slaker, who 
Pearson noted wasn’t 100 
percent, would sit the game 
out to recuperate.
“He 
still 
wasn’t 
100 
percent,” Pearson said. “I 
think you could tell that, just 
some puck touches and that. 
I thought we won the game, 
Friday, he comes back and we 
lose the game Saturday. He 
didn’t make a big difference in 

the game either way.”
Slaker had been an integral 
part of the offense all season. 
With 13 points and seven 
goals, he is third-highest in 
points and tied for second in 
goals scored on the team. His 
production has powered the 
Wolverines through much of 
their tougher matchups. In 
the 6-5 win over No. 6 Penn 
State, Slaker scored a late-
game goal to claim the lead 
for Michigan before scoring 
another to put a nail in the 
coffin. Against No. 8 Notre 
Dame, he responded with a 
game-tying goal immediately 
after the Fighting Irish had 
scored to turn momentum in 
favor of the Wolverines.
But 
Friday, 
when 
his 
teammates 
found out about 
his 
absence, 
they 
didn’t 
doubt 
the 
replacements 
could step up in 
his place.
To take his 
place, Pearson 
sent in senior 
forward 
Brendan 
Warren 
and 
freshman 
forward 
Jack 
Olmstead to fill the role.
“I 
think 
it’s 
definitely 
tough, 
because 
he’s 
been 
playing so well for us,” said 
sophomore 
forward 
Josh 
Norris. “Obviously Slakes and 
myself and Will have really 
enjoyed playing together, but 
we’ve got a lot of other guys 
that can fill those roles, and I 
thought Olmstead did a great 
job tonight. Warren filled in a 
couple shifts there too, so it’s 
always nice when you have 
those guys that can fill in 
those roles.”
Olmstead primarily filled 
the 
first-line 
forward 
all 
game. Despite no points in 
the stat sheet to show for it, 
he 
generated 
chances 
and 
made cuts that 
forced 
players 
to chase after 
him. 
When 
Warren 
was 
in, he recorded 
a 
primary 
point off of an 
assist to junior 
forward 
Adam 
Winborg.
“That’s the beauty of a team 
sport,” Pearson said. “When 
you have guys out, someone’s 
going to step up, and next 
man up, and we had that 
Friday night. And I thought 
we played much better Friday 
night.
“Sometimes, 
when 
your 
team’s down a guy, your team 
rallies around that. Little 
more sense of urgency, and 
sometimes 
when 
you 
get 
guys back, you think, ‘Oh it’s 
going to be easier, or maybe 
I don’t have to do as much,’ 
or whatever, and if you don’t, 
then you’re in trouble. That’s 
why we have the depth we do. 
It’s easy to throw a guy like 
Olmstead in and not worry 
about him.”

Michigan ready for challenge against No. 13 North Carolina State

When Michigan heads to 
Raleigh, N.C. on Thursday to 
face No. 13 North Carolina State, 
there will be plenty of storylines 
to watch for.
One storyline pits the youth 
of the Wolverines (5-1) against 
the experience of the Wolfpack. 
Michigan 
— 
which 
features 
just three upperclassmen in 
its regular rotation — relies 
on youth, balance and depth 
to dismantle opponents. NC 
State (6-0), meanwhile, uses 
experience, 
efficiency 
and 
high-volume scoring from its 
players, as it has only three 
underclassmen in its regular 

rotation. 
This matchup will be the 
Wolverines’ first time in a hostile 
road environment this season, 
and it remains to be seen how the 
young squad deals with intense 
noise and pressure, which is 
something it will see more of 
come conference play. Michigan 
did travel to Kalamazoo earlier 
this season to take on Western 
Michigan, 
but 
the 
Broncos 
averaged a mere 679 fans per 
game last season. The Wolfpack, 
on the other hand, averaged 
2,500-plus fans last year.
Despite the age and experience 
gap between the two teams, as 
well as the road environment, 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico is not worried about her 

freshmen.
“I think (freshman guard) 
Amy Dilk has been waiting for 
this 
opportunity 
her 
whole 
entire life, … as 
did 
(freshman 
forward) 
Naz 
Hillmon,” Barnes 
Arico said. “Our 
other freshmen, 
I 
mean 
the 
opportunity that 
they have every 
day in practice 
to 
go 
against 
some of the best 
players 
in 
the 
country really prepares them.” 
Another storyline to keep 
in mind will be the battle on 
the boards. Both teams have 

dominated the glass thus far in 
the season and have yet to be 
outrebounded by their opponent 
in a game. 
The 
Wolverines have 
outrebounded 
their opponents 
by an average of 
over 16 rebounds 
per game, while 
NC 
State 
has 
out 
rebounded 
its opponents by 
over 11 rebounds 
per game, good 
for the eighth- 
and 
26th-best 
rebounding 
margins 
in 
the 
nation, 
respectively. 
Michigan, which will take on 

its third ranked team in a four-
game span, will also look to 
senior center Hallie Thome to 
step up and lead the team.
Thome, who averaged over 21 
points on 70-percent shooting in 
22 minutes over the first three 
games, has struggled since the 
competition heated up. Over 
the course of the three game 
Gulf Coast Showcase, Thome 
averaged only 10.3 points on 
48-percent shooting in nearly 29 
minutes.
In addition to heating up on 
the offensive end, Thome will 
have her hands full on defense 
with 
her 
matchup 
against 
Wolfpack freshman center Elissa 
Cunane. Despite averaging just 
20 minutes per game, Cunane 

has 
scored 
13.3 
points 
on 
61-percent shooting in her six 
games thus far. 
Still, Barnes Arico remains 
undeterred, 
preaching 
total 
confidence in her players and 
knows that all of Thome’s hard 
work will pay off in the end for 
the Wolverines — regardless of 
the stats next to her name in the 
box score. 
“(Thome) has continued to 
work and work and work for 
an opportunity to be the best 
player she can be, but also for an 
opportunity to help the team be 
the best team that we can be,” 
Barnes Arico said. “I think she 
continues to work (hard) and 
… she just sets a great example 
every day.”
