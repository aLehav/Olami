In light of racist comments 

written on Black students’ 
doors this past weekend in 
West Quad, many students 
are unhappy with University 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel’s 

apparent silence. 

Though Schlissel tweeted 

a response Sunday evening to 
the writings — where students 
found “N-----” written on 
their dorm door name tags 
— Schlissel has since not 
spoken outwardly about the 
racism and any action the 
University would plan to take 
with regard to these types 
of incidents. Aside from the 

Division of Public Safety and 
Security investigation into 
the incident, there have not 
been any other administrative 
responses.

LSA senior Isaiah Land, 

president of the University 
of Michigan branch of the 
National Association for the 
Advancement 
of 
Colored 

People, 
acknowledged 
the 

conflicts that Schlissel may be 
facing with regard to making 
a statement, but stressed the 
fact the Black community 
deserves the same amount of 
support and attention as any 
other group on campus.

“I’m 
just 
really 

disappointed,” Land said. “I 
know that he’s handling a lot 

The positive impact of the 

Blavin Scholars Program is 
unquestionable to donors Paul 
and Amy Blavin. Stepping 
back from the support it 
provides for 37 students who 
have experienced foster care 
in their life, they see a broader 
goal. 

“It’s the American dream 

personified,” Paul Blavin said. 

When 
the 
Blavins 

introduced 
the 
program, 

they said they were met 
with uncertainty. Still, since 
2009, the Blavin Scholars 
Program has strived to create 
a stress-free community in 
which students can have a 
“normal college experience.” 
In addition to financial aid of 
up to $5,000, Blavin scholars 
receive 
campus 
coaches, 

educational 
programming 

and options for year-round 
housing, 
including 
during 

holidays and breaks.

BSP 
Director 
Miriam 

Connolly said the program 
intentionally 
grants 
their 

scholars’ requests to remain 
invisible. She stressed how 
important the prospect of 
anonymity is.

“This 
is 
what 
we 
call 

an 
invisible 
population,” 

Connolly said. “Some want to 
remain invisible because they 
just want a normal college life. 
I feel like it’s really critical for 
the student to feel like this is 

their program.”

Housed 
within 
the 

Dean 
of 
Students 
Office 

and 
in 
partnership 
with 

the Department of Health 
and Human Services, the 
program has admitted 54 
students 
and 
currently 

supports 37 students, with 
eight graduating next spring. 
The 
program 
also 
boasts 

a 95 percent retention and 
graduation rate.

After reading Dave Pelzer’s 

novel “A Child Called ‘It,’” 
Blavin said he was inspired 
to begin the program with his 
wife. In the novel, Pelzer tells 
the story of an abused child 
who goes into foster care only 
to face even more challenges 
later in life.

According to the Foster 

Care Alumni of America, only 
3 to 10 percent of individuals 
who have spent time in foster 

care graduate from college, 
and 
more 
than 
425,000 

children in the United States 
are in foster care. The Blavins 
and Connolly aim to change 
the narrative of those who 
experience foster care.

“There aren’t very many 

of these programs around 
the country,” Paul Blavin 
said. 
“Through 
trial 
and 

error, we’ve figured out that 

On Tuesday’s Central Student 

Government 
meeting, 
CSG 

President 
Anushka 
Sarkar, 

an LSA senior, spoke on the 
weekend’s racist incidents in 
West Quad Residence Hall, in 
which three Black students found 
derogatory remarks on their 
dormitory door decorations. She 
confirmed CSG’s responsibility 
in representing those affected by 
such incidents, and expressed her 
disappointment in the weekend’s 
events.

“To be honest with you, I don’t 

know what to say about it. It’s 
incredibly hurtful and frustrating 
for the students who experience 
that 
and 
to 
the 
campus 

community as a whole when we 
see this sort of thing happen and 
you don’t feel like you can do 
anything about it,” she said. “We 
are very passionate about finding 
a way to rework the bias response 
incidents 
program 
that 
the 

University has … this weekend is 
proof that if you don’t step up and 
work on these issues there will be 
no improvement in the way that 
we take on the response process.”

U.S. 
General 
and 
former 

Secretary 
of 
State 
Colin 

Powell 
was 
greeted 
with 
a 

standing ovation at a packed 
Hill Auditorium on Tuesday 
afternoon. The event, organized 

by the University of Michigan 
College of Engineering, was part 
of the James R. Mellor Lecture in 
conjunction with the Goff Smith 
Prize.

The event was formatted as 

a discussion between Powell 
and Alec Gallimore, dean of the 
College of Engineering, who read 
questions composed from a few 

of the hundreds of questions that 
audience members had submitted 
in 
advance. 
The 
questions 

covered topics such as technology 
and politics and offered advice for 
future generations.

LSA freshman Eve Winter was 

interested in what Powell had to 
say about politics.

“Colin Powell is really well 

known, and I’m really interested 
in politics so I decided to come,” 
she said. “It’s also a really good 
way for me to continue to explore 
the field. This is the second event 
that I’ve gone to, and it’s really 
nice to see students come and get 
involved and I think that more 
students should take advantage

Alektiar said one of her 

favorite things about studying 
chemistry, 
which 
directly 

relates to her research, is that 
the concepts are logical and 
applicable.

“It’s nice to be working on 

something where you can see the 
point of it, you can see the direct 
application of it to something 
that is relatable to everyone,” she

Alektiar explained the lab

Every Wednesday, the Michigan 
Daily will be asking a University 
faculty member, staff member 
or student what the University 
bicentennial means to them. 

“I watched this film about the 
University campus before it was 
this booming — everything is 
so different. There’s a lot that 
has changed. The buildings 
have been renovated and the 
students dress differently. But 
many things have stayed the 
same: frst parties, students 
orgs, people running around on 
the diag... it’s the future now, 
but the University’s character 
really isn’t that different.”

SMTD sophomore 
Jaime Murriel

WOLVE RINE OF THE WE E K

of that.”

Powell began the event by 

talking about his upbringing in 
the South Bronx, and specifically 
how growing up in a diverse area 
formed the basis of his respect 
for 
others. 
This 
sentiment 

was similarly expressed in his 
opinions regarding diplomacy, 
and how it is necessary to keep 
an open dialogue with other 
nations to solve problems.

Rep Debbie Dingell (D-Mich) 

also received a shout out from 
Powell. Prior to the event, she 
spoke in an interview about how 
much she admired him. 

“I have known Colin Powell 

for decades,” she said. “Alma is 
one of my best friends. I think 
he is truly the epitome of what 
a public servant is. He loves this 
country and he is really just a 
good man and I am excited that 
he is in my hometown of Ann 
Arbor.”

Throughout the event, Powel 

emphasized 
the 
importance 

of 
continued 
investment 
in 

technology in ensuring the U.S.’s 
status as a top nation.

“We 
are 
a 
technological 

nation, and we cannot lose the 
advantage that we have over 
other 
nations,” 
Powell 
said. 

“It is important that if our 
nation wants to stay on top, we 

have to continue investing in 
technology.”

Powell also expressed his 

disappointment regarding the 
country’s 
race 
relations. 
In 

response to the recent racially 
charged incidents which have 
taken place on the University’s 
campus, Powell offered a message 

of strength and support for 
minority students.

“I 
think 
the 
college 

administration and the student 
bodies have to push back against 
this kind of thing. But don’t let one 
nut with a spray paint can destroy 
the community that exists in the 
University. There will always be 
folks like this — I’ve faced them 
throughout my life,” Powell said. 
“My own attitude has been, you 
can call me anything you want, 
but watch me, I’m going to do 
my job. I’ve always felt that those 
who’d like to look down on me 
because I’m Black or because I’m 
an immigrant or because I didn’t 
go to the right school — that’s 
their problem. I’m not going to let 
it become mine.”

He also encouraged people 

not to let the racist actions 
diminish the University’s overall 
reputation.

“We should push back with 

all the pressure we can against 
those who feel this way and 
believe these things, but we can’t 
do it by destroying the school or 
by having actions that are not in 
good order — or discipline, as we 
would say in the military — and 

if it’s one or two people, don’t 
let them turn upside down a 
university of 40,000,” he said.

LSA senior Daniel Wu also 

shared Winter’s feelings and 
talked about his excitement 
to learn from Powell.

“I like going to events 

where 
there 
are 
famous 

people coming to campus,” 
he said. “I love attending 
events on campus because 
there are so many interesting 
things happening and you 
just learn a lot. I love when 
famous 
people 
come 
to 

campus 
because 
they’re 

really interesting people with 
interesting stories.”

Powell 
ended 
his 

conversation with Gallimore 
by stressing the importance 
of taking care of one another 
and 
understanding 
the 

responsibility 
that 
each 

individual has both to others 
and to the country.

“Kindness is something 

you can give away, and you’ll 
never understand the impact 
that you had on another,” 
Powell said.

DOG DAYS ARE OVE R

JULIA LAWSON/Daily

Students pet therapy dog Kipper at the Dogs on Diag event, which was moved into the Ugli due to rain on Tuesday.

money is not the issue. It’s the 
struggles that continue once 
you get into college unless the 
proper support is provided.”

Connolly said she believes in 

“student-centered 
planning,” 

and begins by looking at each 
prospective scholar’s needs, 
such as career development, 
life skills preparation, identity 
formation and their university 
community experience.

“We 
provide 
a 
holistic 

approach,” 
Connolly 
said. 

“Each student is different. 
We work through each and 
every aspect of that scholars’ 
undergraduate experience and 
their life to really help them 
gain the skills they’ll need to 
be successful at the University 
of Michigan.”

Scholars have access to one-

on-one support, mentoring and 
community building. They also 
set goals at the beginning of 
each semester and meet with 
coaches at least once a month.

Blavin 
scholar 
Samantha 

Wilson, an LSA senior, has 
been in the program since 
the fall of 2015 when she 
transferred to the University. 
She said her mentor has had a 
positive influence on her life 
and has helped her through 
difficult times.

“My mentor is one of the 

best people on the planet,” 
Wilson said. “It’s just lovely 
to have her in my life. We can 
talk about personal things 
and that’s the beauty of being 
paired with a mentor — you get 
to choose what you want the 
relationship to be like.”

Wilson said the program 

levels the playing field and 
gives students with difficult, 
complicated 
and 
differing 

pasts people they can trust.

“To be on more of a level 

playing field, to say, ‘I am 
here, no matter my path and 
no matter what has happened’ 
is so impactful,” Wilson said. 
“To have someone say, ‘I’ve got 
your back,’ for a lot of people 

it’s unprecedented and it’s 
uncomfortable. … It provides 
such a serene, haven-like place 
for so many people, and I mean 
that in terms of state of mind.”

The program helps students 

eliminate financial barriers by 
providing a $5,000 scholarship 
each year to help pay for 
personal needs in addition to 
their financial aid package.

“It meets any gaps the 

student has in their financial 
aid package,” Connolly said. 
“Our students may have more 
emergent 
needs 
than 
the 

average student. Some scholars 
deal with homelessness while 
others just lack funds to finish 
their degree due to family 
obligations.”

Wilson said she uses the 

scholarship money to pay for 
classes and food.

“It’s 
removed 
a 
lot 
of 

barriers financially,” she said. 
“I don’t have to worry about 
where my next meal is going to 
come from or how I’m going to 
pay for this class. All the who, 
what, where, when and how’s 
now have answers.”

Many 
struggles 
scholars 

face stem from a lack of 
community, 
Blavin 
said, 

which causes pressure socially 
and academically. There are 
therefore 
several 
events, 

including 
dinner 
with 
the 

Blavins on Thanksgiving for 
students without a home and 
social gatherings, in order to 
build a community.

Connolly said a major goal 

of the program is to turn a 
large campus into a small place 
where students feel welcome. 
Blavin added how lonely college 
can be for minority students, 
both socioeconomically and 
racially, without a network of 
support.

“College can be a lonely 

place,” Blavin said. “When 
you’re a minority on campus, 
it can be a very difficult place. 
So 
we 
have 
a 
supportive 

community that I think our 
scholars find beneficial. It’s the 
love and attention our scholars 
receive 
from 
everybody 
— 

that’s where success comes 

from.”

Connolly and Blavin said not 

all scholars have the privilege 
of having a family for support, 
which is where coaches help. 
Coaches, such as Connolly, 
help scholars move and provide 
dorm supplies such as bedding, 
laundry detergent and other 
items.

“Thinking about this idea 

of 
family 
privilege, 
every 

scholar’s 
experience 
is 

different,” Connolly said. “Our 
scholars may not have family 
support like their roommates. 
We may be that support — so 
we’ll load up our cars and help 
them move onto campus. And 
we’ll also supply them with all 
of the things that they’ll need.”

Wilson 
said 
she 
has 

struggled to build consistency 
in her life.

“Abandonment 
can 
be 
a 

huge component of being in 
care,” Wilson said. “I’ve had 
a lot of overturn in my life. 
It’s like a revolving door. To 
have someone stay is a rarity. 
To have consistency, I think 
would be a component that 
needs to be worked on.”

Going 
forward, 
Connolly 

and 
Blavin 
would 
like 
to 

have 
100 
scholars 
in 
the 

program and create a positive 
experience for students who 
have experienced foster care. 
Other goals include growing 
their alumni base, expanding 
even more in the community 
and affecting governmental 
policy.

“In 
the 
future 
of 
the 

program, I do see us going to 
100 students,” Connolly said. 
“And I do see us changing the 
narrative around students who 
have experienced foster care. 
We’re looking at how we can 
improve these outcomes.”

Paul Blavin said he hopes 

organization, 
faculty 
and 

even students continue their 
support 
for 
the 
program 

because they drive its success.

“We all can be rooting for 

the success of these students,” 
Paul Blavin said. “It’s an 
amazing example of the power 
of the human spirit.”

Sarkar later expanded on this 

in a statement. 

“The anti-black targeting of 

students this past weekend in 
West Quad is indicative of a larger 
problem that is perpetuated by 
both active hatred and quiet 
bystanders,” she wrote. “It is 
impossible to stop every force 
of racism and hatred, but it 
is certainly within the reach 
of every single member of the 
Michigan community to vocally 
and actively stand up against 
these acts of hatred. If you are 
not doing so, you are complicit 
in these continued incidents. 
I encourage those of you who 
have stood by until now to join 
those who continue to face these 
attacks. 
Without 
community-

wide and active solidarity, hatred 
will continue to manifest in these 
cowardly acts.”

The assembly then moved on 

to their guest speakers. Dean of 
Students Laura Jones explained 
what the Dean of Students Office 

offers and how they hope to 
facilitate leadership advancement 
with CSG. She said working with 
students from CSG is one of the 
matters that has defined her 
perception of the University of 
Michigan as such a distinguished 
institution.

“I want to acknowledge and 

thank you for caring enough 
about the institution to run for 
office and to be a part of student 
government,” she said. “I really 
value and appreciate the role that 
you play and what your purpose 
is.”

Jones also introduced Jim 

Hoppes, the newly hired program 
adviser 
for 
Central 
Student 

Government. 
Taking 
over 
a 

role that works closely with 
CSG, Hoppes, who attended the 
University as an undergraduate, 
looks to build upon previous 
experience working with student 
leaders.

“I’m very excited for this 

year and I hope to help you all 
accomplish your goals,” he said.

In updates from the executive 

branch, Sarkar discussed projects 
such as CSG’s new partnership 

with Lyft, featuring $10 passes 
that work from midnight until 6 
a.m. and that CSG hopes to make 
available to students next week.

“One of the things we had 

campaigned on was security 
threats for walking home late at 
night among students, especially 
in the South U, East U area,” she 
said. “I worked with Lyft over 
the summer to get late night ride 
passes for everyone.”

Other 
projects 
currently 

addressed 
by 
the 
executive 

branch include food insecurity 
initiatives that look to build upon 
last year’s progress, in which CSG 
worked with the dean of students 
to facilitate a referral program 
by CAPS and SAPAC that allows 
students in need to receive six 
free meal swipes at University 
dining halls.

In addition, CSG approved the 

appointments for new leadership 
in 
several 
positions 
and 

commission chairs, including LSA 
sophomore Isabelle Blanchard as 
chief programming officer and 
LSA junior Niccolo Beltramo as 
chair of the Student Organization 
Funding Commission.

bond a carbon atom and a metal. 
To preface her work, Alektiar 
explained most molecules have 
a carbon-hydrogen bond. When 
people get sick, the bacteria 
in their bodies can evolve, she 
continued, eventually making 
them 
immune 
to 
certain 

medicines. 
Therefore, 
there 

needs to be a way to develop new 
medicines efficiently.

“The way that issue is being 

tackled is you kind of have to 
start at ground zero,” she said. 
“You have to start and basically 
make almost exactly the same 
thing, just change one thing 
about it, but you have to start 
from the very beginning. It’s not 
the most effective way because 
you are wasting a lot of the stuff 
that you’ve already made before 
you realized it wasn’t useful. 
So it’s just a much longer, time-
consuming process.”

However, Alektiar explained 

she has recently worked in the 
lab with carbon-hydrogen bond 
functionalization to improve the 
process.

Now, Alektiar is currently 

starting to do more research 
with metals — something she 
said aligns with what she is 
looking to do in the future. She 

said wants to get her Ph.D. in 
organic chemistry, and is very 
interested 
in 
photocatalysis. 

Alektiar offered a simplified 
definition of the photocatalysis 
process, saying it uses light to 
make reactions occur.

“A lot of the fundamentals 

and 
techniques 
that 
I’m 

learning through the different 
projects I’ve been doing at 
the Montgomery lab, I will be 
able to apply them to then do 
photocatalysis in the future,” she 
said.

Wilson 
is 
also 
studying 

chemistry and has been working 
a project in the Montgomery 
lab since January. His work 
involves 
biocatalysis, 
which 

uses natural enzymes to speed 
up chemical reactions, of which 
he uses mutants to modify big 
macromolecules.

“Essentially, 
we’re 

speeding up the process of the 
pharmaceutical company so that 
they can screen more antibiotics 
quicker,” he said.

Wilson 
said 
he 
modifies 

substrates — substances that 
undergo chemical reactions.

“For me, the most interesting 

part 
is 
that 
I 
can 
make 

modifications on the molecule 
and then force something that 
is biologically active to do that 
reaction on a molecule in a 
different way,” he said. “It’s 

a little bit of a power trip in a 
way, but obviously in a nerdy 
way. You’re able to basically 
manipulate the molecule any 
way you want to.”

Wilson took Chemistry 210, 

an organic chemistry course, 
with Montgomery as a freshman. 
He said he was interested in 
the theory behind the material 
so he often stayed behind to 
ask questions after class and 
soon 
expressed 
interest 
in 

Montgomery’s research.

Wilson said he enjoys the 

research he is doing because 
he gets to establish a personal 
connection 
with 
high-level 

faculty that can help him to 
understand the material; he said 
speaking directly with experts 
in the field is a “one of a kind” 
experience that is not necessarily 
offered in classes.

In terms of why research is 

important, Wilson said in the 
current political climate there is 
the perception that research isn’t 
as important because the results 
are not necessarily tangible.

“I obviously have a scientific 

background … I understand that 
essentially all scientific research 
is important in some way no 
matter how far removed away 
from process it is,” he said.

A

of different students and a lot 
of different donors and things 
like that. But even if it’s a small 
group of students, we matter 
here and I want people to know 
that. It’s kind of a slap in the 
face when I get an email about 
the Bicentennial when three 
days later there’s no address to 
the racists incidents, and you 
are still sending out emails 
about bicentennials.”

LSA 
freshman 
Dylan 

Gilbert shared some of Land’s 
sentiment, and explained she 
is upset but not surprised by 
Schlissel’s inaction.

“I wasn’t that surprised 

because 
(racist 
incidents) 

happens all the time, and at this 
point I’m pretty desensitized to 
it all. I think people don’t like 
addressing what makes them 
uncomfortable, 
especially 

in 
such 
a 
predominantly 

white 
university,” 
Gilbert 

said. “They probably have no 
idea what to do and are most 
likely floundering a little bit. 
There definitely needs to be 
a statement made explaining 
that we protect students and 
don’t like stuff like this to 
happen.”

Because of this, students 

have taken matters into their 
own hands: The Black Student 
Union 
and 
the 
Michigan 

branch of the NAACP held 
an 
event 
titled 
“Destress” 

Tuesday evening to discuss 
strategies for supporting the 
Black community and moving 
forward after the recent racial 
incidents that have taken place 
on campus and downtown Ann 
Arbor. 

Black students, faculty and 

allies piled into the Modern 
Language Building to look for 
ways to ensure that African-
American students feel safe and 
comfortable at Michigan. The 
event was orginally slated to 
be held in the Yuri Kochiyama 
lounge of South quad but 
changed due to high interest. 
It was casual, and offered 

students a chance to voice 
their emotions, experiences 
and opinions following recent 
incidents of racism in a safe 
and comfortable environment.

One of the students was LSA 

sophomore 
Kaitlyn 
Brown, 

who reflected on the alarm she 
felt after finding out about the 
writings in West Quad.

“I was also shocked — hurt 

— that this is something that’s 
happening at my school and in 
my community. It’s personal. 
I’m 
appalled 
that 
this 
is 

happening now, in 2017, on 
my campus, happening to my 
people. Why is this something 
that is still going on?” Brown 
said. “And it’s hurtful that 

people even think that’s OK. 
Like they actually thought 
about it, and then did it, and 
didn’t think there would be any 
consequence.”

The 
Destress 
event 
is 

one of many ways the Black 
community 
on 
campus 
is 

working to heal and move 
forward. During the discussion 
portion, 
suggestions 
such 

as having mandatory race-
relation 
training 
for 
each 

student, faculty member and 
GSI 
and 
reclaiming 
Black 

spaces 
on 
campus 
were 

explored.

Throughout 
the 
day 

Tuesday, students and allies 
also participated in a “Black-
Out,” dressing in all black to 
show solidarity with the Black 
community.

Land 
explained 
the 

importance of a “Black-Out” 
and explained how the show of 

solidarity is comforting during 
tough times.

“When you look and see 

someone wearing all black, 
whether it’s an ally or someone 
in your community, you can 
easily look at them and say, 
hey, you’re with us, you’re not 
against me and you want to 
make a change with me,” Land 
said.

The 
University 
chapter 

of the NAACP, The Muslim 
Students Association, Central 
Student 
Government, 
and 

JustDems, 
the 
University’s 

chapter 
College 
Democrat’s 

social 
justice 
committee, 

as 
well 
as 
handful 
other 

students 
organizations, 

tweeted in solidarity with the 
Black Student Union and the 
statement they released. 

Public Policy junior Lauren 

Schandevel, 
communications 

director for the University’s 
chapter of College Democrats, 
wrote in an email interview 
the black-out had full support 
from her organization.

“College 
Democrats 

supports the black-out 100%,” 
she wrote. “We encouraged our 
members to participate, too.”

Both 
Gilbert 
and 
Land 

hope people continue to show 
their support for the Black 
community 
and 
that 
the 

administration 
makes 
more 

of an effort to help minority 
students on campus.

“They can start talking about 

it, holding people accountable 
for their actions and showing 
that if they find the people who 
did it that they take serious 
measures. Also by addressing 
it and showing that they stand 
with the Black students in the 
University,” Gilbert said.

Land 
urged 
the 
entire 

community 
to 
stand 
in 

solidarity 
and 
support 
the 

movement.

“This 
movement 
is 
for 

everybody. I think typically 
we come and see it’s mostly 
Black students in these type of 
spaces, and I encourage anyone 
who is with us to come out and 
voice your opinion and show 
support.”

RESPONSE
From Page 1A

I’m appalled that 
this is happening 

now, in 2017, 

on my campus, 
happening to my 

people


O

n Thursday, President 
Donald 
Trump 

reiterated 
his 

controversial 
and 
widely-

criticized assertion that “many 
sides” share blame for the 
violence 
in 
Charlottesville, 

Va., in August. Trump cited 
recent 
clashes 
between 

antifa, 
a 
militant 
anti-

fascist 
organization 
and 

white 
supremacist 
groups 

in 
Charlottesville 
as 
well 

as subsequent rallies across 
the nation, claiming antifa’s 
aggression justified his earlier 
reluctance to denounce white 
nationalism. 

Antifa’s 
methods 
— 

particularly their willingness to 
provoke violence with the far-
right — are worthy of criticism, 
but one can denounce these 
methods without establishing 
moral 
equivalency 
between 

antifa and the white supremacists 
they oppose.

In 
the 
weeks 
since 
the 

Charlottesville 
rallies, 

considerable attention shifted 
to antifa, the far-left political 
movement that has taken a 
visible role in opposition to the 
so-called 
“alt-right.” 
Antifa 

was present in Charlottesville 
and took on more central 
roles in subsequent rallies in 
Berkeley, Calif., and Portland, 
Ore. Videos of antifa members 
attacking right-wing protestors 
led 
conservative 
political 

commentators to vocally decry 
the group. After the episode 
of violence in Berkeley, House 
Minority 
Leader 
Nancy 

Pelosi released a statement 
condemning the group and 
calling 
for 
the 
criminal 

prosecution of instigators.

Though 
other 
liberals 

have 
defended 
or 
expressed 

admiration for antifa, Pelosi 
is right. There is compelling 
evidence that antifa members 
incited the political violence in 
Berkeley and elsewhere. Jake 
Tapper, a CNN journalist, alleged 
that antifa members attacked 
journalists in Charlottesville.

It is prudent to denounce 

these 
methods, 
as 
our 

democracy thrives only under 
the framework of peaceful and 
respectful dialogue. Violence, 
even 
if 
retaliatory, 
against 

political opponents, no matter 
how vile their views, only 

degrades our ability to find 
and 
implement 
constructive 

solutions 
to 
our 
problems. 

Antifa’s violent tactics have 
demonstrated that the group 
aims to silence its political 
opponents through force and 
intimidation, 
which 
is 
an 

ugly and detestable strategy 
regardless of ideology.

Such violence and intimidation 

is neither justified nor pragmatic, 
as it only lends credence to 
President 
Trump’s 
claims 

of 
moral 
equivalency 
while 

also 
perpetuating 
the 
white 

nationalists’ 
false 
narrative 

of white persecution by the 
left (when in fact, right-wing 
extremists have been responsible 
for 74 percent of politically-
motivated killings in the past 
decade). 
Furthermore, 
this 

violence 
irreversibly 
isolates 

antifa 
from 
the 
political 

mainstream, 
fracturing 
the 

opposition to white nationalism. 
The nation needs to form a united 
front against white supremacists, 
neo-Nazis and other far-right 
hate groups in order to effectively 
oppose white nationalism, but 
antifa’s belligerence impedes our 
ability to do so.

Perhaps most detrimentally, 

antifa has become a political 
distraction, drawing attention 
away from the anti-hate message 
of 
the 
counterprotest 
and 

siphoning criticism away from 
white nationalism. The national 
debate over antifa has shielded 
white nationalists from further 
criticism, even as they continue 
to stage rallies and marches 
across the United States. It is 
clear 
antifa’s 
methods 
have 

overshadowed its message, and 
that it is now a glaring liability 
in the struggle against white 
nationalism.

However, criticism of antifa 

should in no way establish, or 
even imply, a moral equivalency 
between 
antifa 
and 
white 

nationalism. Though labeled 
an 
anarchic 
group, 
antifa’s 

decentralized nature prevents it 
from developing a cohesive far-
leftist ideology. Rather, antifa’s 
ideology is rooted in opposition 
to white supremacy, bigotry and 
racial hatred — after all, the 
group’s name is shorthand for 
anti-fascism.

Contrast 
this 
to 
the 

ideals 
of 
the 
white 

nationalist demonstrators in 
Charlottesville: overt racism, 
anti-Semitism and homophobia. 
Many of them openly identified 
with neo-Nazi organizations 
and 
other 
hate 
groups. 

Perhaps some of the “alt-right” 
marchers 
would 
bristle 
at 

being labeled a neo-Nazi, but 
it cannot be denied that they 
willingly associated themselves 
with 
neo-fascism 
while 

enthusiastically 
participating 

in a rally that had become a 
symbol of white supremacy. 
Indeed, the demonstration was 
promoted as a rally to “Unite 
the Right.”

This 
leads 
to 
another 

key 
distinction. 
While 
the 

“alt-right” 
marched 
in 

Charlottesville 
under 
the 

coordinated pretext of unifying 
the various factions of the “alt-
right”, the counterprotestors 
were an ideologically eclectic 
group linked by only their 
common 
disgust 
of 
white 

supremacy 
and 
neo-Nazism. 

The 
anti-white 
nationalist 

crowd 
in 
Charlottesville 

included clergy, students and 
community leaders, with antifa 
only comprising a small, albeit 
visible, 
minority. 
Heather 

Heyer, 
the 
victim 
of 
the 

Charlottesville car attack, was 
not a radical, but an innocent 
woman brave enough to stand 
against racism.

Heyer’s 
tragic 
death 

exemplifies why it is inaccurate 
and disrespectful to push a “both 
sides” 
narrative, 
especially 

when 
characterizing 
the 

events in Charlottesville. The 
aggressive methods of antifa 
warrant explicit denouncement, 
but critics must be wary of straw 
man-ing the counterprotestors, 
as 
the 
vast 
majority 
are 

not 
represented 
by 
antifa. 

Furthermore, 
any 
criticism 

of antifa must not establish a 
pretext of moral equivalency 
between white supremacy and 
its opponents. The strongest 
condemnation 
should 
be 

reserved for white nationalism, 
as it is simply misguided to 
continue to focus on antifa when 
the more clamant matter is the 
pervasive presence of bigotry in 
American society.

or many students, a 
dorm room functions 
as a home away from 

home, a personal space that 
is sacred, a place where they 
should always feel comfortable 
and safe to come back to. But 
this week, this space was 
violated. Four students in 
the 
Michigan 
Community 

Scholars Program came home 
to their dorm rooms in West 
Quad Residence Hall to find 
racial slurs graffitied on the 
nametags 
on 
their 
doors. 

Only one day later, racist 
graffiti, along with a picture 
of Dylann Roof — who shot 
and killed nine members of a 
predominantly Black church 
in Charleston, S.C. — were 
discovered on a mural on East 
Liberty Street in downtown 
Ann Arbor. 

These are just two of the 

horrific instances of racism 
that we have seen on campus, 
and there have been a number 
of other notable instances 
of publicly displayed racism 
during and after the 2016 
presidential election of Donald 
Trump. These incidents have 
only served to create a hostile 
and unsafe environment for 
many students on our campus, 

and as editors of the Opinion 
Section of The Michigan Daily, 
we stand against this hatred 
and racism and we stand with 
and among everyone affected 
by 
these 
incidents 
during 

these times and always.

As 
administrators, 

professors and communities 

across campus are reacting to 
these events and expressing 
their solidarity, we felt it was 
important that we remind 
those around us that we too 
stand with those affected. Our 
section prides itself in being an 
inclusive space where people 
feel comfortable expressing 
their opinions, but as was said 
in our letter from the Editorial 
Page Editors, racist, hateful 
speech is not tolerated in our 

section, and we condemn the 
actions of those individuals 
that made those they targeted 
feel unsafe on our campus.

As a newspaper, we are an 

institution 
that 
is 
forever 

grateful for the rights we have 
to exercise free speech and the 
rights afforded to us through 
freedom of the press. But 
as Wendy Woods, associate 
director of MCSP, said in her 
address 
during 
the 
MCSP 

solidarity 
event, 
incidents 

such as the racist graffiti on 
students’ dorm rooms is not 
an issue of free speech. It is 
threatening, hateful and plain 
and simple racism that we 
cannot allow to masquerade 
as something protected by the 
First Amendment.

Shade

M

y story is nothing 
new — I’m a Black 
girl with darker skin, 

so finding foundation and other 
makeup in shades that don’t 
make me look like a ghost is a 
challenge. At the very 
least, 
most 
brands 

have a few “darker” 
shades to give the 
illusion of inclusivity, 
but this facade comes 
crashing down when 
many darker-skinned 
women put them on 
their skin.

Popular drugstore 

brands are especially 
bad when it comes to 
making products for 
those with more melanin than 
most. Going into any popular 
drug store, I know the darkest 
foundation or powder of most 
brands will be too light for me. 
But even brands at stores like 
Sephora and Ulta have this 
problem too.

In 
addition, 
products 

marketed to Black women are 
more likely to contain harmful 
chemicals. So there are few 
products to begin with, and 
when brands do offer products 
for Black women, they’re more 
likely to be harmful than those 
marketed to the general public.

Makeup has recently made 

me a bit emotional. Constantly 
walking through makeup aisles 
filled with products you know 
will be way too light or make 
you look ashy gets irritating very 
quickly. When a brand actually 
takes the time to ensure it carries 
products for people with skin 
too dark for the token brown 
foundation shade, it is a fantastic 
shock to me. The release of 
Fenty Beauty by Rihanna has 
made me feel like the industry is 
making more of a space for me. 
It’s hard to find brands with 20 

shades of a foundation, let alone 
40. I wasn’t disappointed, which 
is not the norm for me when it 
comes to makeup.

Even 
before 
I 
saw 
the 

products, I was excited. Rihanna 

and 
everyone 

behind 
the 
Fenty 

brand 
made 
it 

clear through their 
advertisements and 
posts on Instagram 
that 
this 
makeup 

isn’t for a select 
group of people. It 
isn’t just for people 
in the skin tone 
range of “Porcelain” 
through “Tan.” The 
brand prides itself on 

this, with a quote from Rihanna 
on the home page emphasizing 
that “Fenty Beauty was created 
for everyone.” Unlike many 
other makeup brands, Fenty 
doesn’t just create the illusion of 
inclusion — it actually delivers.

Other brands’ unwillingness 

to meet the same standards as 
Fenty doesn’t make sense. It’s 
financially smart to make more 
products catered to women with 
darker skin. For example, despite 
being a minority of the U.S. 
population, Black women spend 
80 percent more on cosmetics 
than “general consumers.” This 
discovery was made years ago, 
but it seems like many popular 
brands have decided to ignore 
this memo. If brands offer 
darker shades they won’t be 
disappointed with the additional 
revenue they generate because 
there’s a market — even Fenty’s 
darkest foundation shades are 
selling out.

Fenty Beauty just launched 

on Sept. 8, but is not the only 
inclusive brand on the market. 
Supermodel Iman created her 
own cosmetics line in the ’90s 
specifically for women of color. 

Brands like L.A. Girl Cosmetics, 
Anastasia Beverly Hills and Nars 
also stock their shelves with 
colors that complement many 
skin tones. Fenty Beauty is part of 
a trend of bringing more products 
to the market for people with 
darker complexions.

This topic is about more than 

makeup, it’s about who is valued 
and who is represented. The 
makeup industry as a whole has 
not made a strong attempt to 
cater to women with dark skin, 
and a lackluster attempt at best 
to cater to women with lighter 
shades of brown skin. For years, 
the beauty industry has given 
women with these skin tones no 
attention; it expects these women 
to be happy with the few brown 
colors on shelves and call it a day.

The beauty industry uses the 

same approach in advertising. 
No one expects them to offer 
dark shades, so they don’t feature 
dark-skinned models in their

FOREIGN FAMILY COLLECTIVE

Paramore commands the 
crowd at the Fox Theater

At first, the screaming was 

so deafening that for a moment 
I was actually afraid.

Then the moment passed, 

and I remembered where I was 
and what was going on. I was 
at a concert. The intermission 
after the opening act of Best 
Coast was over, and all seven 
members of Paramore had just 
run out onto the stage.

Paramore 
is 
tied 
to 
an 

interesting 
brand 
of 
fan 

culture. Older bands typically 
spearhead devoted groups of 
longtime listeners, many of 
whom know the band’s history 
and 
can 
list 
every 
album 

chronologically, whereas the 
concerts of more recent groups 
are often attended by younger 
fans who are primarily excited 
about material from the last 
few years. Paramore walks the 
line comfortably between these 
two groups, which is part of 
why their concerts are always 
so much fun: there are people 
who just started listening to 
them (thanks to singles like 
“Ain’t It Fun” and “Still Into 
You”), and people who have 
followed their journey all the 
way back since Riot!, and even 
All We Know Is Falling.

No matter which side of the 

aisle you fall on, though, the 
level of energy at their live 
shows is undeniable.

The pop punk band kicked 

off 
Friday 
night’s 
concert 

with “Hard Times,” the foot-
stomping 
single 
off 
their 

newest album, After Laughter. 
From 
there 
they 
plunged 

straight through consecutive, 
roof-raising performances of 
hits like “Ignorance,” “Still 
Into You” and “Daydreaming.” 
The show never seemed to 
falter — Paramore has so many 
catchy songs from so many 
successful records that every 
opening 
chord 
progression 

seemed to throw the crowd 
into a frenzy. The band skated 

easily 
between 
their 
own 

songs, with equal enthusiasm 
for older hits like “That’s What 
You Get” as for newer ones like 
“Forgiveness” and “Brick By 
Boring Brick.”

Hayley Williams herself was 

a force of inexorable energy. 
She strutted around the stage, 
flipped her hair and weight-
lifted the microphone stand 
with one hand, all without 
losing the dynamic force of her 
vocal performance.

The entire night, Williams 

commanded an intriguing and 
telling presence, in that the 
audience’s mood always felt 
mirrored to her own. When 
she was on her feet, jumping 
and shouting along to her 
own lyrics, so was everyone 
else; people cheered at the 

top of their lungs, and bouncy 
balls pinballed around the 
lower level of the theater. And 
when she settled back down 
momentarily to thank us for 
coming and to talk about her 
feelings, we settled, too.

“This is one of those nights 

where it feels like you don’t 
know how this happened, it’s 
like it’s not deserved,” she said. 
“It feels like a really special 
night to talk about feelings.”

There were a few intimate 

moments like this. Part of it 
came through the music itself 
— during slower songs like “26” 
and “Hate to See Your Heart 
Break,” 
audience 
members 

closed their eyes and swayed, 
waving the lights from their 
phones back and forth in the 
air. But a big part of it came 
from Williams herself; every 
sentence she uttered came off 

as truly genuine, and when she 
talked to the audience as one 
might a friend, she managed 
to 
make 
even 
The 
Fox’s 

huge venue seem intimate. 
When she spoke of the band’s 
appreciation for how far their 
fans have taken them since 
Riot!, one got the sense that 
she really was speaking from 
the heart.

“I want you to close your eyes 

and imagine yourself ten years 
ago,” she said at one point. 
“Ten years ago, it was 2007 — 
that’s math — and it was a very 
different time, especially for 
good old bands like us. And we 
just so happened to put out our 
second record, it was called 
Riot!, that year, and we set 
out across the United States of 
America on the Warped Tour 
... And it was beautiful because 
that year, we met so many of 
you. It was a big year for us.”

By the time the show was 

over, there were plenty of 
fun moments to look back on: 
a cover of Fleetwood Mac’s 
“Everywhere,” 
the 
moment 

Paramore invited a fan onstage 
to sing the end of “Misery 
Business” and the fact that 
they dedicated the show, “like 
every show we play in Detroit,” 
to a fan named Papa Smurf 
who once gave Williams a pair 
of earrings in 2005. But what 
resonated perhaps the most 
was the band’s genuine effort 
to include the audience in the 
fun of the performance as 
much as they could.

Williams 
closed 
out 
the 

encore by introducing the rest 
of the performers: Justin York, 
Logan McKenzie, Joe Mullen, 
Joey Howard, Taylor York and 
Zac Farro. “And all together, 
we represent something that’s 
bigger than each one of us 
alone,” she finished. “So who 
are we?”

And 
when 
the 
audience 

shouted 
back, 
“We 
are 

Paramore!” it sounded as if, in 
that moment, everyone in the 
whole theater was telling the 
truth.

CONCERT REVIEW

REPUBLIC

In pursuit of self agency: ‘I 
and Love and You’ and me

Whenever life starts to get 

a little too heavy and days 
start to feel a little too long, I 
have a propensity to lose sight 
of myself. My interests, my 
footing, my breath — they all 
just evaporate in this haze of, 
“Why does everything always 
have to happen at once?” It’s 
paralyzing, 
this 
feeling 
of 

being in a funk but also needing 
to conquer the world. It’s in 
these times, this time, that I 
often turn to a certain pair of 
brothers to pluck me out.

Directed by Judd Apatow 

and Michael Bonfiglio, the 
documentary “May it Last: A 
Portrait of the Avett Brothers” 
trails the band during the 
making of their 2016 album 
True Sadness. It’ll hit HBO in 
early 2018, and it had a one-
night-only showing on Tuesday, 
Sept. 12 at various theaters 
across the country. God bless 
the Michigan Theater for being 
one of them.

The 
summer 
after 
I 

graduated from high school (I 
sincerely wish I could refer to 
a less cliché time in my life), 
I saw the Avett Brothers, an 
Americana group, live. Despite 
having seen half of their set at a 
festival in 2015, I wasn’t super 
into their music yet. But in 
this setting, at that particular 
point in my life, something 
shifted. I felt so out of control 
of my future that I just let their 
performance move me. I can’t 
say I went home that night and 
cried, because “cried” isn’t 
a strong enough word. I was 
weeping.

That whole summer was 

full of hesitation, and it was an 
introduction to varying degrees 
of sadness and self-doubt that 
I hadn’t known before. Even 
with close friends, I had always 
felt a little out of place. My 
high school experience was 
somewhat 
unconventional, 

and there were moments when 
it got pretty lonely. When I 
listened — really listened — to 
the Avett Brothers that night, 
it was as if this whole new 
dimension of life just opened 
itself for me.

Fearlessness, love, sorrow, 

heartbreak, freedom, agency 
— all of these feelings were 
just sitting there, waiting for 
me to claim them. They turned 
into possibilities and dreams 
and finally, thank whoever’s 
up there helping me out, I was 
awake for them.

Now, almost a year and a 

half later, this documentary 
about the Brothers comes out. 
I know they don’t know me, 
and they didn’t know I needed 
them, but it’s really like they 
knew I needed them. The Avett 
Brothers are my reset button. 
Hearing their writing process 
and 
seeing 
the 
dynamic 

between Seth and Scott, I felt 
like myself again.

From 
“Open 
Ended 

Life” from Magpie and the 
Dandelion, 
2013: 
“I 
spent 

my 
whole 
life 
talking 
to 

convince everyone / That I was 
something else / And the part 
that kind of hurts / Is I think it 
finally worked.”

These lyrics are poignant 

and eloquent on a level I can 
only ever hope to reach. I 
started to think of all these 
moments when I got hurt by 

vibrating on everyone else’s 
frequency but my own. It’s not 
worth it. I keep having this 
same revelation, and someday 
I hope it sticks (maybe that’s 
what my thirties are for). Until 
the time comes, I have this 
album to revisit whenever the 
chain tugs at me.

My dear love, my aching 

pain, my loyal friend: “I and 
Love and You.” The Avett 
Brothers wreck me like no 
one else can, and this album, 
this song, these lyrics, are the 
epicenter of this.

“Dumbed down and numbed 

by time and age / Your dreams 
to catch the world, the cage / 
The highway sets the traveler’s 
stage / All exits look the same / 
Three words that became hard 
to say / I and love and you.”

I’ll 
repeat 
it 
over 
and 

over again until the world 
stops spinning: I and love 
and you. They’re lyrics that 
have grown with me and will 
eternally continue to do so. 
From big dreams, to baby 
dreams, to crushed dreams, 
this 
documentary 
fed 
me 

perspective, and it showed me 
how to breathe again — grateful 
and boundless.

So, I’ll go. I’ll listen to 

“Head Full of Doubt / Road 
Full of Promise” and start 
living the visions I drum up 
when times gets hectic and 
I feel inadequate. I’ll listen 
to “Murder in the City” and 
remember my mom and how 
much I miss eating her food 
and watching “Gilmore Girls” 
together. I’ll listen to “True 
Sadness” 
and 
let 
myself 

experience pure moments of 
just that. I just listen, and my 
heart thanks me.

COMMUNITY CULTURE NOTEBOOK

“First 
They 
Killed 
My 

Father,” directed by Angelina 
Jolie (“By the Sea”) is one 
of 
the 
most 
heartbreaking 

movies 
of 
the 

year. Telling the 
autobiographical 
story 
of 
Loung 

Ung 
(who 

co-wrote 
the 

screenplay 
with 

Jolie and wrote 
the memoir upon 
which 
the 
film 

is 
based) 
and 

featuring 
an 
all-Cambodian 

cast, the film is an epic and 
disturbing recreation of one of 
the most horrifying events of 
the 20th century.

Beginning in 1975, the film 

chronicles the story of Loung 
Ung and her family as they 
are forced to deal with an 
increasingly 
terrible 
series 

of events due to the rise of 
the communist regime of the 
Khmer Rouge. Fearing they will 

be targeted due 
to their family’s 
connections 
to 

the 
previous 

government, 
they flee to the 
countryside 
where they end 
up forced to work 
in a series of labor 
camps. The family 

is slowly torn apart as the 
genocide ramps up its terror.

Films 
about 
genocide 

are tricky. With a personal 
investment in this story, Jolie 

fills every frame of the film 
with this sense of hopelessness 
and 
confusion 
that 
is 
as 

unnerving as it is compelling. 
The audience will find itself 
hard-pressed to look away as 
the atrocities begin to pile 
up and the sadness of the 
characters’s situation begins to 
hit home. The music by Marco 
Beltrami (“The Hurt Locker”) 
imbues the film with a sense 
of terror as well as a sense of 
scale.

The scale of this film is 

stunning. 
Aerial 
shots 
of 

thousands of people walking 
convey 
the 
sheer 
number 

of 
people 
affected 
by 
the 

Cambodian genocide in a way 
that forces the audience to 
grapple with the subject matter 
, and realize what it would be 
like to be forced from your 

home and lose everyone and 
everything that ever mattered 
to you.

This is not a happy film. It is 

not a film you watch to “enjoy” 
in any real sense of the word. It 
is a film that forces its audience 
to look inside themselves and 
ask why their country didn’t 
do anything, why their country 
should’ve done something and 
if either they or their country 

are doing anything now. There 
are terrible atrocities in the 
vein of the genocides of the 
20th century being committed 
around the world today and by 
and large the western world 
is content to deal with its own 
problems 
and 
do 
nothing. 

In light of that, “First They 
Killed My Father” is not just 
an extremely important film 
but 
also 
extremely 
timely 

one. As extremist groups of 
all kinds continue to cause 
terror and fear all across the 
globe it is important now more 
thAn ever not to forget what 
happened in Cambodia in the 
’70s. Americans did not pay 
any attention then. With “First 
They Killed My Father,” Jolie 
and Ung are doing their part to 
make sure that this time, they 
will.

DAILY FILM COLUMN

Darren Aronofsky and his 
dangerous 
god-complex

Film 
Columnist 
Madeleine 
Gaudin 
criticizes 
Aronofsky’s 

recent 
‘Mother!’ 
in 
her 
continuing 
diatribe 
against 
the 
film

I can’t believe I’m still writing 

about this damn movie. I’d like 
nothing more than to wash my 
brain of Darren Aronofsky and his 
latest assault of the senses. But, 
alas, three days later and I can’t 
get “Mother!” out of my head.

I don’t remember the last 

movie that made me this mad. 
Beyond the hollowness of its self-
serving allegory and its reliance 
on 
spectacle 
over 
substance, 

something in this movie got under 
my skin, and I haven’t been able to 
draw it out quite yet. Hopefully, 
by the end of this piece, I can bury 
this — and my now irredeemable 
relationship 
with 
Aronofsky’s 

films — six feet under.

The image I keep seeing when 

I think about the film is that of 
Jennifer Lawrence, lying on her 
back in the middle of a crowd of 
people. We see her from above and 
headless hands rain down on her, 
hitting, clawing, cutting her. It’s a 
hard image regardless of who is 
making it. But knowing that the 
eye on the other side of the camera 
and the hand that wrote the scene 
both belong to a man, the same 
man — it’s not just awful, it’s bad 
writing. 

I’m reminded of a WIRED 

article from a few years back 
written in response to rape scenes 
in 
“Game 
of 
Thrones.” 
And, 

while there’s no explicit rape in 
“Mother!,” the same rules apply. 
Here, violence against women 
is not used to further a male 
character’s plot line, but rather 
for spectacle — a box Aronofsky 
checks off on his way to full 
sensory overload. 

More 
so, 
my 
nausea 
is 

heightened by the clear link 
between Aronofsky and the film’s 
male lead, the troubled male artist. 
A trope that normally warrants an 
eye-roll, in “Mother!” is, of course, 
brought to sickening heights. Javier 
Bardem’s character is a dismissive, 
emotionally abusive husband with 
a superiority complex. He’s a good 
character — probably the most 
interesting in the movie. But, it’s 

also clear that he’s supposed to be 
Aronofsky.

I thought, at first, that I was 

grasping at straws, looking for 
a way to connect the director to 
the center of the film’s evil. But 
then I read an interview in which 
Aronofsky described the script 
“pouring out of him” like “in a 
fever dream,” an event mirrored 
by the poet in the film. Bardem 
wakes up one morning and writes 
the poem that sets the third act in 
motion. 

While it’s not the poet’s hands 

that beat his wife in this horrific 
scene, it is his own inability to 
live without the attention his fans 
— who have overrun his house 
— give him that puts her in the 

position to be attacked. I’d like 
to think Aronofsky’s alignment 
with Bardem’s character is a self-
aware one. I hope he isn’t that 
dense. But, even if this is a self-
aware manifestation of himself, 
it doesn’t feel like one that has the 
level of self-criticism to make up 
for the vileness of the character.

I don’t doubt that Aronofsky 

loves the attention and admiration 
his fan base of film school kids give. 
He’s talked about eavesdropping 
on people praising his movies. He 
clearly thinks himself a genius.

I really wish I could laugh at him. 

This level of self-righteousness is 
hilarious. Aronofsky is the sort of 
character I wish I’d written. But, 
there’s something more sinister 
going on with the trope he buys 
into that keeps me from rolling my 
eyes, tweeting and moving on.

Everything 
Aronofsky 
does 

perpetuates the idea of “genius” as 
something that one man (always 
a man) achieves in a state of 
monomania, locked in his room, 
scribbling his masterpiece, riding 
the wave of adrenaline and the 
compulsion of God, the muses or 
innate and unmatchable skill. 

It’s absurd, yes. It’s laughable, 

of course. But it also severely 
limits the discussion of what art 
we consider “genius.” The solitary 
male 
genius 
is 
a 
dangerous 

narrative. It gives people like 
Aronofsky a hall pass to make 
movies like “Mother!” It asks 
us to overlook things like the 
aforementioned scene as part 
of a singular artistic vision, one 
whose power we mere consumers 
can only sense and whose deeper 
meaning we can only guess at. 

If Aronofsky wants to make 

a self-critical movie about an 
abusive, male “genius,” I’ll be the 
first in line. But I think he probably 
thinks he already did that with 
“Mother!,” which is a real shame. 
“Mother!” is a lot of things, but it’s 
definitely not a passable attempt 
to properly dismantle the myth of 
the solitary genius.

“Mother!” could have been good. 

If it did the things I think it wanted to 
do, it could have been a challenging 
and deeply vulnerable look at 
the interworking of the director’s 
mind. But, simply, Aronofsky takes 
himself too seriously, believes more 
wholeheartedly than he’d like to let 
on in his own myth to be truly self-
critical. 

That’s precisely why the image 

of Jennifer Lawrence at the center 
of the raging sea of people is so 
unsettling, and why I’m thinking 
about the dumpster fire that was 
this movie days after I left the 
theater — it feels like we’re seeing 
the scene through Aronofsky’s 
own eyes. And he stays, watching, 
for a beat too long, pausing before 
intervening to help. 

He basks too long in the glows 

of his creation to be truly critical 
of the creator. That’s why, with all 
it’s disgust and gore, “Mother!” still 
feels like Aronofsky’s wet dream 
about himself. Though we spend 
the most time with her, this movie’s 

not about Mother at all.

COMEDY CENTRAL

Yet another creepy still from a long-lasting show
The Oversized Shadow: 
20 Years of ‘South Park’

The animated show has graced and scarred the lives of 
millions. Here’s a testament to its cultural criticism

Philadelphia 
basements. 

Williamsburg 
hotel 
rooms. 

Michigan treadmills. For the past 
20 years, “South Park” has been 
with me through it all, but it 
didn’t get that way overnight.

It started — much to the 

disapproval of my parents — in 
fourth grade, once I discovered 
my brother covertly watching 
“South Park” in our dark, dusty 
living room. At the time, I barely 
knew “South Park” even existed. 
To me, it was just like any other 
raunchy animated comedy that 
I wasn’t supposed to watch. 
Settling into our peeling brown 
leather sofa, I quickly realized 
that it wasn’t like any of those 
other shows. I was hooked 
instantly.

For the rest of that dreary 

November afternoon, my brother 
and I sat perched on the couch, 
our eyes glued to the television 
screen. Ignoring the huge sheets 
of water pelting our house 
outside, we ran through dozens 
of classic episodes, beginning 
with “Trapped in the Closet.” 
As the Tom Cruise and Church 
of Scientology jokes piled up, 
my body began to ache from 
laughing so hard.

I was abruptly ripped from 

this euphoria by the noise of 
my mom’s white Ugg slippers 
smacking against the floor as 
she approached us holed up on 
the sofa. Almost immediately, 
my brother flipped the channel 
to CNN. I have no doubt that 

my mom didn’t believe that 
we’d been laughing so much at 
the news, but by that point I no 
longer cared. I just needed more 
“South Park.”

Luckily, it wasn’t hard to find — 

due to its overwhelming success, 
“South Park” had more airtime 
on Comedy Central than a shitty 
Viagra ad (and believe me, there 
were lots of those). It seemed 

to follow me everywhere, even 
to the cramped confines of the 
Williamsburg, Va. Holiday Inn 
during a seventh-grade school 
trip.

After an absolutely thrilling 

day exploring dusty shoemaker 
shops, we returned, weary and 
exhausted, to our worn-down 
hotel. To us middle-schoolers, all 
that mattered was sleep. That is, 
until one of my roommates heard 
that there was a new “South 
Park” episode premiering that 
night. Huddling in front of the 
small, ancient box in the center 
of the room, my roommates 
and I silently prayed for a good 
episode.

Our prayers were immediately 

answered in the form of one of 
“South Park”’s most hilarious 
episodes, 
“It’s a Jersey 

Thing.” For 22 minutes, “South 
Park” relentlessly mocked the 
worst that television has to offer 
in MTV’s infamous series “Jersey 
Shore.” And for 22 minutes, my 
roommates and I struggled to 
contain our laughter at seeing 
a gross render of “Snooki” run 
around yelling “smush smush.” 
Stuck in a 17th-century town 
on a trip led by everyone’s least 
favorite math teacher, “South 
Park”’s familiarity helped to not 
only entertain us, but comfort us 
by reminding us that there was, 
in fact, a world beyond our tiny 
Holiday Inn hotel room.

But “South Park” didn’t stop 

there — it followed me for 
another seven years to Ann Arbor. 
As I brainstormed ways to make 
my daily (read: weekly) treadmill 
run less monotonous, I realized 
there was nothing better to run 
to than “South Park.” I spent 
many of those Spring Term gym 
trips screening the latest “South 
Park” season to catch up on the 
series. My addiction got so bad I 
almost started to enjoy running, 
except for when I inevitably had 
to pause each episode to ensure 
I didn’t fall off the treadmill from 
dying of laughter.

I’ve never had enough time to 

watch every single “South Park” 
episode, but it’s always been 
there with me, like an oversized 
shadow following closely behind 
me. Whenever something big 
happens today, I’ve come to 
expect there to be a “South Park” 
episode dedicated to ripping it 
apart with jokes. It’s been that 
way for 20 years, so why stop 
now?

I’d like to think 

Arnofsky’s 
alignment 

with Bardem’s 

character is a self-

aware one

Long learns under Lewis, readies for new test

Comparisons 
have 
been 

popular around Schembechler 
Hall this year. 

For 
a 
young 
Michigan 

football team, it’s easy to 
understand 
why. 
Plenty 
of 

elite talent is gone. Shoes need 
to be filled. And the frames 
of 
reference 
are 
made 
to 

emphasize that the young talent 
are worthy replacements.

And on Tuesday night, the 

latest of those comparisons 
was 
revealed 
when 
senior 

receiver 
Grant 
Perry 
was 

asked, simply, what makes 
sophomore cornerback David 
Long good. 

“I see a lot of things in him 

that I saw in Jourdan Lewis and 
(Channing) Stribling,” Perry 
said. “He got a full year under 
their belt. They got to walk 
him through the ropes and he’s 
strong, he’s fast, he’s physical — 
you know, everything that you 
saw in Jourdan and Stribling, 
you see in David.”

That’s not bad company. 

And, upon further inspection, 
the comparison makes sense. 

Long said he still talks to 

Lewis every day of the week — 
or at least three if he’s busy.

And Long could arguably 

thank Lewis — who he dubbed 
as a role model — for his 
current starting role with the 
Wolverines.

When it came to the technical 

side of playing cornerback, 
Lewis played mentor from day 
one.

“When I first got here, I 

was in here a lot with Jourdan 
Lewis,” Long said. “… He 
helped me a lot with technical 
stuff. He was just helping me 
with stuff on the field, getting 
me comfortable with that.”

On Aug. 6, though, Long’s 

fate as Michigan’s starting 
cornerback wasn’t so certain, 
as defensive coordinator Don 
Brown was vocal in saying 
that up to seven players could 

compete for the two starting 
spots in 2017.

Fifteen days later, not much 

had 
changed. 
Cornerbacks 

coach Mike Zordich admitted 
that sophomore Lavert Hill 
had seized one starting job, 
but expressed his frustrations 
with the rest of the group’s 
consistency. As he put it then, 
he wanted someone to “grab it 
and run with it and take it.”

As it turns out, Long did. His 

coaches’ words motivated him. 
By the time Michigan opened 
against then-No. 17 Florida, he 
was the one who claimed the 
second corner spot alongside 
Hill. And given the way he has 
flashed his knack for tackling — 
recording five for a season high 
against Air Force — he won’t be 
letting go of it anytime soon.

“I just kept pounding away,” 

Long said. “My progress wasn’t 
where the coaches thought 
I needed to be, but I just 
kept working, didn’t let that 

discourage me, take it like 
a grain of salt. That’s what 
you’re supposed to do. You’re 
supposed to coach me, be hard 
on me and I’ve progressed as 
the weeks have gone on.”

But really, for Long, the 

progression has been going on 
for just over two years.

When he was a senior at 

Loyola High School in Los 
Angeles, Long doubled as a 
receiver and cornerback before 
arriving in Ann Arbor. Long 
said playing receiver helped 
him with the “book stuff” that 
comes with football. He was 
able to easily pick up schemes 
and learn coverages.

But 
Long 
admitted 
that 

he 
still 
wasn’t 
completely 

comfortable with the position 
until late in the summer. Now 
that he is, though, the small 
details of the position are 
starting to matter even more.

“Coach 
Brown 
is 
really 

preaching to me,” Long said, 

“ ‘See a little to see a lot’, so 
(I’m) working on my technique 
and it’s just slowing things 
down for me.”

This 
Saturday, 
Michigan 

could 
benefit 
from 
things 

slowing down for Long — and 
the rest of the secondary too.

Purdue is led by quarterback 

David 
Blough, 
who 
has 

completed 51 of his 67 passes for 
597 yards, six touchdowns and 
two interceptions. Blough isn’t 
playing rollover teams either. 
Three of those touchdowns 
and 362 of those yards came 
on the road against then-No. 
16 Louisville and at Missouri. 
And unlike Michigan, Purdue 
has scored a touchdown on 10 
of its 13 red zone trips.

Or put more simply, the 

Wolverines’ 
secondary 
is 

finally about to be tested.

What better way for people 

to really find out just how 
much Long has learned from 
Lewis?

Big Ten matchups twice as important for Michigan

As far as the No. 8 Michigan 

football team is concerned, its 
season starts now.

After 
two 
home 
non-

conference games that didn’t 
exactly go according to plan, 
the Wolverines (3-0) are eager 
to close the curtain. While 
their mentality has always 
been that the most important 
game is the next one, the 
pressure is cranked up a notch 
now that the Big Ten season is 
set to begin.

As 
Michigan 
coach 
Jim 

Harbaugh made clear Saturday 
night, conference games count 
for much more. With how close 
the Big Ten races have been in 
recent years — then-No. 2 Ohio 
State was left out of the Big 
Ten championship game after 
it allowed 17 fourth-quarter 
points in an eventual three-
point loss to then-No. 24 Penn 
State last October — Harbaugh 
said 
that 
Big 
Ten 
games 

are worth twice as much as 
nonconference contests.

His team has adopted that 

mantra, too.

“We want to win the Big 

Ten games. We want to win 
all of them,” said sophomore 
receiver Eddie McDoom on 
Monday. “We know that if we 
lose, it’s a big crush on the 
season, so we’re trying to go 
into the Big Ten season and 
tear it up.”

The 
Wolverines 
will 
be 

tested right off the bat when 
they head to Purdue for their 
conference opener Saturday. 
The Boilermakers are off to a 
surprising 2-1 start after an 
abysmal 3-9 season in 2016. 
Though they opened the season 
with a narrow neutral-field 
loss to then-No. 16 Louisville, 

they rebounded with blowout 
wins over Ohio at home and 
Missouri on the road.

Much 

credit 
for 

Purdue’s early 
resurgence 
is due to new 
head 
coach 

Jeff 
Brohm, 

who previously 
spent 
three 

years 
at 

Western 
Kentucky 
— 

compiling 
a 

30-10 overall record, a 19-5 
Conference USA record and a 
3-0 bowl game record. Not only 
were the Hilltoppers back-to-

back league champions in 2015 
and 2016, but they were ranked 
in the top 10 in the nation in 

scoring 
offense, 

passing 
offense 

and total offense 
all three seasons.

Brohm 
has 

taken 
that 

successful model 
and 
adapted 

it 
to 
fit 
the 

Boilermakers, 
rejuvenating the 
program in the 
process. 
While 

the Big Ten is traditionally 
known for stout defense and 
power running, Brohm and 
Purdue have taken the opposite 

approach, 
emphasizing 
a 

pass-heavy and high-scoring 
offense more emblematic of 
the Big 12. 

The 

Boilermakers 
are 
averaging 

286.7 yards per 
game and boast 
10 
passing 

touchdowns 
— 
a 
stark 

contrast 
from 

their 
average 

of 
173 
yards 

and four total 
touchdowns on the ground. 
The strategy has worked well 
for them in non-conference 
play, but how well it will fare 

in the Big Ten remains to be 
determined.

“They 
have 
a 
lot 
of 

confidence right 
now,” said senior 
linebacker Mike 
McCray. 
“They 

do a lot of things 
well on offense. 
They 
use 
two 

quarterbacks, 
they have athletic 
backs (and) they 
have an offensive 
line 
that 
uses 

great technique.

“... 
They’ll 
be 
a 
great 

challenge for us.”

Michigan 
knows 
how 

beneficial it can be to inject 

a team with a new coach and 
overall philosophy. Harbaugh’s 
arrival just three years ago has 
already turned the program 
around 
faster 
than 
many 

expected after its dismal 2014 
campaign, and the Wolverines 
see that same process could be 
happening now at Purdue. 

“When you get a new coach 

and you start winning, (there’s) 
just 
a 
lot 
of 
confidence,” 

said senior offensive tackle 
Mason Cole. “... And having 
confidence in this sport is a 
good thing to have. So, a team 
with a new coach that’s playing 
really well, it can be scary.”

Adding on to the challenge 

of facing the Boilermakers, 
who Cole described as a team 
“with a lot of new energy,” 
Michigan will be playing its 
first true road game of the 
season in West Lafayette.

Though the fans at Michigan 

Stadium 
weren’t 
entirely 

forgiving of the Wolverines’ 
plethora 
of 
non-conference 

mistakes — as boos rained 
down in back-to-back games for 
the first time in the Harbaugh 
era — a hostile environment on 
every down will be new terrain 
for Michigan to traverse.

“Going 
to 
Purdue 
and 

playing there is obviously a 
challenge,” Cole said. “... (It’s) 
playing on the road, playing 
against a team that’s been 
playing well, that has some 
momentum 
and 
has 
good 

players, too.”

The Boilermakers may not 

have posed much of a threat 
to the Wolverines in recent 
years, but Michigan has been 
humbled into the lesson that 
it can no longer afford to look 
past any team. With the Big 
Ten season now upon them, 
the 
Wolverines 
know 
that 

every game counts. Twice.

EMMA RICHTER/Daily

Senior offensive tackle Mason Cole was quick to acknowledge that a matchup against the Boilermakers on the road will be a difficult test for Michigan.

‘M’ stumbles in debut

After a rough first round at the 

East & West Match Play on Sunday 
morning, the Michigan women’s 
golf team was in last place with a 
score of 301. However, senior Emily 
White shot a 69 — three under par 
— in the second round later that day 
to lead the Wolverines, recovering 
from her initial round of 75.

But unlike White, who finished 

the stroke play competition tied 
for seventh, the Wolverines failed 
to rebound. At the end of Sunday’s 
stroke play, despite a second round 
score of 290, Michigan sat in fifth 
place — only one position shy of the 
four-team championship bracket, 
won by Iowa State.

“Our second round was the 

second lowest of the afternoon 
rounds on Sunday, so that was a 
good comeback,” said Michigan 
coach Jan Dowling. “We didn’t 
start very well on our first 18 on 
Sunday for the 36 hole stroke play 
portion. They came back really well 
and made a run to get into the top 
four for the match play part.”

The format for the event was 

different than other tournaments. 
It was a three-day event, comprised 
of 
stroke 
play 
Sunday 
and 

championship 
and 
consolation 

match play brackets on Monday and 
Tuesday.

Throughout the weekend, the 

Wolverines came up just short of 
victories as a team. Entering the 
consolation bracket as the first 
seed, Michigan faced Oregon State 
on Monday. Freshman Ashley Kim 
and junior Elodie Van Dievoet 
both won their matches, up by six 
with four holes left and two-up 
respectively, and Michigan was tied 
at two with the Beavers.

Senior Megan Kim, Ashley 

Kim’s older sister, was all square 
in her match through 18 holes and 
had to play extra holes. She ended 
up losing on the 21st hole when her 
competitor birdied, giving Oregon 
State a 3-2 victory.

“The other girl won it, and you 

got to give her credit,” Dowling said. 
“She made the birdie when she had 
to, so we were certainly outplayed.”

On Tuesday, Michigan faced 

Nebraska in a battle for seventh 
place. Megan Kim and White both 
won their matches, up by three 
with two left and up by three with 
one left respectively, thus securing 
two points for the team, while the 
Cornhuskers won two points of 
their own.

In the deciding match’s 18th hole, 

Van Dievoet’s opponent, senior 
Audrey Judd, converted on a clutch 
birdie attempt. The Wolverines lost 
2-3, finishing the bracket in last 
place.

“All of our matches were 

really close,” Dowling said. “They 
were competitive matches ... but 
unfortunately we got outplayed in 
those matches.”

Senior Kathy Lim represented 

Michigan in the individual match 
play portion of the tournament, 
after topping the field in 2015. Lim 
advanced to the finals, looking to 
claim her second title, but fell just 
shy.

There are still positive takeaways 

from the tournament for Michigan. 
Ashley Kim found success in her 
college debut, carding rounds of 
76 and 73 to tie for 21st during the 
stroke play competition, winning a 
point in match play.

Dowling also mentioned that 

having sisters on the team certainly 
helps with the overall team 
chemistry. She mentioned that the 
younger Kim sister was already 
quite familiar with the program 
when she arrived.

“For me as a coach, it has 

probably 
been 
the 
smoothest 

freshman 
transition 
I’ve 
ever 

experienced,” 
Dowling 
said. 

“Although she is a freshman on 
our team, she is someone they have 
known for a while already, so that 
has been really nice.”

Michigan needs to make some 

changes but must do so quickly. 
Next Monday they travel to Vail, 
Colo. for the Golfweek Conference 
Challenge.

We’re trying to 

go into the Big 

Ten season and 

tear it up.

Going to Purdue 

and playing there 

is obviously a 

challenge.

Notebook: Goaltenders set to lead Wolverines 

Last 
season’s 
three-man 

goaltender rotation for the 
Michigan hockey team is now 
down to two. Zach Nagelvoort 
graduated 
last 
spring, 
and 

sophomores Jack LaFontaine 
and Hayden Lavigne remain as 
the two Wolverine netminders 
with substantial experience. 

And in his first season at 

the helm, Michigan coach Mel 
Pearson seems confident that 
the goaltenders 
can 
handle 

the 
increased 

workload. 
He called the 
rotation 
of 

LaFontaine 
and 
Lavigne 

the 
team’s 

“strongest 
position 
right 

now.”

In 
addition 

to 
the 

increased 
playing 
time, 
though, 

LaFontaine and Lavigne find 
themselves in somewhat new 
leadership positions with the 
team. 

“I feel like as a goalie, you 

kind 
of 
always 
lead 
from 

behind,” Lavigne said. “You’re 
the quiet guy that’s just kind 
of there doing your job every 
single day, you know, in and 
out. There’s definitely going to 
be leadership, not just from me, 
but also from (LaFontaine) and 
(junior goaltender Chad) Catt 
as well. And I think it’s just 
going to be by being confident 
every day in net, just coming 
to work, and being quiet — 
not necessarily an outspoken 
leadership position.”

Added LaFontaine: “Me and 

Hayden both definitely feel a 
responsibility where we need 
to step up now, and this is both 
of our years to kind of take 
this team and kind of build off 

both of our strong seasons last 
year.”

NEWCOMERS 

PREPARING TO EXCEL

 One of the main reasons for 

optimism with this season’s 
Wolverines is their incoming 
freshmen.

Forward Josh Norris was 

a first round pick in the 2017 
NHL Draft, and defenseman 
Quinn Hughes is projected to 
be an early pick in the 2018 

NHL 
Draft. 

Pearson 
pegged 

them as players 
he 
expects 
to 

produce 
at 
a 

high 
level 
for 

Michigan.

“Those 
are 

the two guys you 
expect to have the 
most immediate 
impact,” Pearson 
said. “Obviously 
Josh was a first-
round draft pick, 

so there’s a lot of pressure on 
him to perform, and Quinn 
Hughes is ranked really high. 
They’ve both looked really 
good.”

In addition to Norris and 

Hughes, 
the 
Wolverines 

welcome 
fellow 
first-years 

in 
forward 
Jack 
Becker, 

forward Michael Pastujov — 
brother of sophomore forward 
Nick Pastujov — and Dakota 
Raabe, who Pearson said has 
impressed him with his skating 
and skill.

Michigan 
also 
added 

graduate transfer forward Alex 
Roos, who spent the last four 
seasons at Colorado College.

LOCKWOOD 

RETURNING AT FULL 

HEALTH

When sophomore forward 

Will Lockwood was on the 
ice last season, it was easy 

to imagine what he could 
accomplish 
in 
the 
future. 

Lockwood was one of, if not 
the, fastest skater on the team, 
and he was second on the team 
in points (20), assists (12) and 
goals (8).

The one thing that did stop 

Lockwood 
was 
a 
nagging 

shoulder injury that held him 
out of five games last year.

This year, Lockwood hopes 

to have remedied that issue. 
He had surgery on his shoulder 
last spring, and he claims he’s 
feeling as healthy as ever.

“I feel great,” Lockwood 

said. “The surgery was timed 
well, so I’m ready to go at the 
beginning of the season. So, 
yeah, I’m feeling really good 
about it. … We’ve done a really 

good job rehabbing it and 
everything, so I feel confident. 
We’re starting the season up, 
and I’m really excited for that.”

With that newfound health, 

the Wolverines will rely on 
Lockwood, as Pearson said 
at the team’s Media Day on 
Tuesday.

“I’m looking for a big year 

out of Will,” Pearson said. “I 
like the way he plays. Being on 
the opposite bench last year 
watching him, he’s the kind of 
guy you want on your team. You 
didn’t want to play against him, 
so it’s going to be a lot more 
enjoyable and relaxing for me 
to have him on our team instead 
of playing against him.”

DANCS, WARREN 

“X-FACTORS” OF THE 

TEAM

 In his time at Michigan 

Tech, 
Mel 
Pearson 
turned 

the Huskies from a perennial 
underdog into one of the best 
teams in the country in Corsi-
percentage. As a result of that, 
many players on his teams put 
up impressive stat lines.

With scoring being one of 

Michigan’s biggest problems 
last season, Pearson is looking 
to have a similar effect on the 
Wolverines.

Tuesday, Pearson pointed 

out senior forward Dexter 
Dancs 
and 
junior 
forward 

Brendan Warren as “x-factors” 
for the team. Dancs showed 
some promise in his sophomore 

season, accruing 17 points on 
seven goals, and Warren had a 
17-point campaign of his own 
two seasons ago.

But both Dancs and Warren 

regressed last season. Dancs 
scored only one goal, and 
Warren had just 10 points.

For Pearson, the challenge 

lies 
in 
giving 
Dancs 
and 

Warren the confidence to be at 
the top of their game.

“I think you have to give 

them that confidence as far as 
their roles and playing them,” 
Pearson said. “If they have 
a bad shift or a bad game, 
continue to play them. Give 
them an opportunity to work 
through that.

“… They’re key guys to us 

having success.”

MIKE PERSAK
Daily Sports Editor

I feel like as a 
goalie, you kind 
of always lead 
from behind.

Pearson brings confidence, Michigan must back it up
I

t’s an unenviable task to 
take over a coaching job 
from the greatest coach in 

the history of a program.

That’s 

exactly what 
Mel Pearson 
is doing 
with the 
Michigan 
hockey team. 

For 

Pearson, 
though, 
taking over 
for Red 
Berenson 
— the Wolverines’ coach for 
the last 34 seasons — isn’t as 
enormous an undertaking as 
it may seem. He served under 
Berenson in different capacities 
for 22 seasons before taking his 
first head coaching job with 
Michigan Tech in 2011. Pearson 
knows Ann Arbor, and he 
knows Michigan hockey.

He’s surrounded himself 

with people he’s familiar with, 
too. Associate head coach 
Bill Muckalt won two NCAA 
Championships as a player with 
the Wolverines while Pearson 
was behind the bench, and he 
was an assistant coach under 
Pearson with the Huskies. 
Assistant coaches Brian 
Wiseman and Steve Shields 
were each recruited by Pearson 
to play at Michigan, and they 
coached with Pearson once their 
playing careers were finished.

For one, Pearson and Muckalt 

have a tenure of turning around 
struggling hockey programs. 
They did it together with 
Michigan Tech, bringing them 
from a cellar-dwelling team 
to two NCAA Tournament 
appearances in just five years, 
and Muckalt won a Davis Cup 
with the USHL’s Tri-City 
Storm for the first time in the 
franchise’s history.

But whether or not they can 

turn around a Wolverines team 
that was the third-worst in the 
country in Corsi-percentage 
remains to be seen.

Additionally, there are 

the highly-touted freshmen, 
who look like they’ll make 
immediate, positive impacts. 
Namely, forward Josh Norris — 
a first-round NHL draft pick in 
2017 — and defenseman Quinn 
Hughes — a projected first-
round pick for the upcoming 
2018 draft — were picked by 
Pearson as first-year players 
who have impressed him.

Even their contributions 

aren’t a sure thing yet, though.

Still, at Michigan’s Media 

Day on Tuesday, players and 
coaches alike repeated that 
there’s a greater sense of 
optimism this season.

“I think it’s just an 

excitement of everybody having 
a fresh start,” said senior 

forward Dexter Dancs. “I don’t 
think Red and Mel’s coaching 
styles are too different but it’s 
just the excitement of having 
a new guy and having a clean 
slate.”

Added sophomore forward 

Will Lockwood: “Mel’s bringing 
a lot of energy, and we have a 
lot of new guys, and everyone 
fits well. I think a lot of the 
chemistry between guys is great 
which has brought the mood in 
the locker room up too.”

This talk of positive feelings 

came the day after the Big 
Ten Preseason Coaches’ poll 
predicted the Wolverines would 
finish second to last in the 
conference.

Many of the Michigan players 

shook it off as something they 
try not to pay attention to, but 
all of them knew about the poll, 
and some of them let on that it 
will be used as motivation.

“We don’t try and look too 

much into that,” Dancs said. 
“But it’s obviously a little bit of 
an F you, I guess you could say, 
to us. We’re excited to prove 
everyone wrong.

“It was a little bit of a topic 

of conversation, but, you 
know what, we’re not looking 
too much into it. But it will 
definitely be in the back of our 
mind when we play every team 
this year.”

That type of language ran up 

and down the team. Whether 
it was sophomore goaltender 
Hayden Lavigne saying the 
Wolverines will “come out as 
the underdog and finish on top,” 
or Muckalt saying the beauty 
of the game is that it isn’t on 
paper, everybody relayed a 
feeling of confidence that this 
will be a successful team.

And if you want to know 

where the confidence comes 
from, look no further than the 
new head coach.

“I’m not a forecaster, but 

if I had to pick, I’d pick us 
to win the league,” Pearson 
said. “We’ve got all the things 
we need to be successful, 
but you’ve got to go out and 
execute. You’ve got to go out 
and prove it.”

And therein lies the 

challenge. Despite all the 
talented young players, the 
grizzled veterans who have 
been through the ups and 
downs of the last few seasons 
and the new head coach with 
a seemingly magic touch, 
Michigan still has to perform 
on the ice.

The Wolverines have talked 

the talk. Now, when the regular 
season begins on October 6, 
they need to walk the walk.

Empath in the wild: struggling to justify my path to peace
A

s someone who’s dealt with and continues 
to deal with disordered eating, most 
mainstream forms of exercise have come 
to be at odds with my mental and physical 

health. All the numbers and measurements of 
gym equipment, and fluorescent-lit rooms with 
mirrored walls are like an obstacle course for my self-
confidence. Most of the time, quantifying anything in 
relation to my body — whether it’s weight, mileage on 
a run, or intensity level on an elliptical — facilitates 
harmful thought patterns that have taken me years of 
introspective work to break. 

My yoga practice began when I realized I could 

not keep running outside and going to the gym while 
maintaining my physical and mental health. I used 
to be big into running, but paired with an eating 
disorder, I damaged my bone density. Now, high-
impact exercise leads to stress fractures in my legs 
and feet. And gyms are hazardous to my peace of 
mind. After years of struggling with all these factors, 
by 2015, during the spring of my freshman year, I 
stopped working out because I felt I had no good 
options.

A few months later, I felt incredibly lethargic in my 

body and needed a solution.

That’s when a friend showed me “Yoga with 

Adriene,” a YouTube channel that changed my life. 
Adriene’s videos walked me through the intricacies 
of basic yoga poses, and soon, I was able to follow 
along with her flow videos, all in the comfort of my 
own home. I did this all summer and into the fall of 
my sophomore year.

Adriene’s videos were slow-paced and heavily 

focused on self-acceptance and personal well-being. 
She emphasizes adjusting poses according to one’s 
own physical needs, not pushing yourself too hard 
and remembering it’s a practice. You’ll get where you 
want to be eventually. Adriene calls most poses by 
their sanskrit names, and she mentions elements of 
Hinduism in her videos — something about the third 
eye I don’t quite understand, but about which I’ve 
been curious to learn more. She says “Namaste” at the 
end of every video, but I never said it along with her 
— again, I don’t really know what that word means 
outside of being a general greeting and a way to wish 
someone well. I know that much, but I don’t know 
why people say it when they’re finished doing yoga, 
specifically. Although I knew my yoga practice might 
be a form of cultural appropriation, I didn’t feel I was 
doing much harm because I did her videos alone in 
my house. It felt like I was the only person involved.

But after a while I found myself wanting more than 

Adriene’s videos could offer me. I was pretty sure I 

was doing the poses correctly, but I wanted someone 
who knew more than me to tell me for sure. I decided 
to explore some free trial classes at different studios 
in Ann Arbor and encountered a whole new level of 
appropriation, a whole new kind of Americanized 
yoga compared to what Adriene taught.

Now, I’m very aware of my identity as a white 

affluent American suburban girl who now pays 
money to do Americanized yoga about three times per 
week. I know very little about the origins of yoga in 
the ancient Indian religions of Hinduism, Buddhism 
and Jainism, so I feel uneasy about the ways I may 
be appropriating a culture that isn’t mine — patching 
together pieces of it to benefit myself. But the stakes 
are high for me when it comes to physical exercise. 
Because of the way society has taught me to view 
my body, and because conventional forms of exercise 
have become hazardous to my health, I’ve turned to a 
practice I struggle with internally.

At the yoga studios I went to in Ann Arbor, I found a 

community of people with whom I shared some basic 
understandings about physical, mental, and spiritual 
well-being. Most people I met seemed to value 
meditation, a relatively slow-paced approach to life, 
and a generally healthy lifestyle. However, the classes 
were too fast-paced for me and too many things we 
did were quantified by the instructors. I didn’t have 
time in class to really feel my way into poses, and I 
hated counting breaths and straight up doing sit-ups 
in class. I did yoga to get away from the gym, but in 
some ways, I felt the yoga studios around here were 
the same thing — just with oil diffusers and better 
lighting.

To maintain my practice in a way that feels good 

for me — that is slower and incorporates less counting 
— I supplement my time in the studio with yoga I 
do on my own, in my apartment. And even though 
I get frustrated with my studio, when compared to 
running or going to the gym, going to class provides 
for me a respite from measurements and frees me 
from assessing my self-worth accordingly.

And it’s not just about the eating disorder and body 

image stuff. Like a lot of students here, I’m really busy 
with schoolwork, extracurricular activities, my social 
life, and keeping in touch with my family back home. 
When everyday obligations build tension in me, I can 
smooth it out with yoga. Instead of running or going 
to the gym, where my anxieties are just replicated 
in the act of measuring my body and ramping up my 
heart rate, doing yoga is my foundation of inner peace.

I see the people, a lot of whom are students, in my 

yoga classes and I wonder if they feel the same. As 
students at the University, they likely have a lot of 
school work, maybe have a job, and are involved in 
at least one student org of some kind. Like so many 
undergrads on campus, they likely feel immense 
pressure to be “successful” in all of these endeavors. 
 

Maybe yoga, for them, too, is a way to find release, 
and I hope that they, too, feel just as uneasy about this 
Americanized version of what’s, for many people, a 
deeply religious, spiritual practice.

When I see people say “Namaste” at the end of class, 

bowing their heads “to the light that is in each of us,” 
I don’t know what any of them are thinking. I know 
that together all of us in the studio have just worked 
really hard to relax our bodies and ease our minds. 
The expressions on the faces that surround me show 
a kind of making peace with what has passed before 
class, and a kind of making peace with what’s to lie 
ahead, outside the safe walls of the studio.

Still, I don’t say “Namaste” at the end of class. It 

doesn’t feel quite right. And I don’t wear shirts that 
say things like “spiritual gangster,” a phrase that’s 
problematic on multiple levels. Can I say my yoga 
practice is justified because of the personal stakes 
at hand? I don’t know. I also, unfortunately, don’t 
personally know a lot of people who practice yoga as a 
religious practice to know how my own practice may 
be affecting others negatively. While I’m in college 
with so many things going on, I don’t know how 
I’ll find a form of exercise that balances my mental 
health, physical health, and my personal standards of 
social responsibility. I guess for now my best option 
is to remain thoughtful about my habits, to keep 
questioning them, and to keep looking for better 
solutions.

I 

tripped and ate shit the 
moment I stepped into 
a 300-person lecture 
hall on the first day of 

classes.

“Today Is The First Day Of 

The Rest Of My Life” — John 
Denver

Composing 
myself 
and 

dusting off my freshly-pressed 
thrifted Hawaiian shirt, I 
made my way to my first 
lecture of my college career: 
Something-Something 
101. 

Despite having just ruined 
any chances of making friends 
by becoming really solid 
acquaintances with the floor, 
optimism shined through me 
— no sense in being a stick 
in the mud when your entire 
future is sprawled out in front 
of you like Thanksgiving 
dinner.

A goofy smile stretched 

across my face. I always knew 
I would major in Something-
Something. My dad was a 
Something-Something major. 
My mom was a Something-
Something 
major. 
My 

grandma’s brother’s uncle’s 
neighbor in West Palm Beach, 
Florida, was a Something-
Something major. It was 
my destiny. No, it was my 
Destiny’s Child.

Before I got that carpet-

shaped indent in my face, the 
first day of college couldn’t 
have been more picturesque. 
Nothing like Animal House 
though.

“Perfect Day” — Lou Reed
“It was a perfect day. I’m 

glad I spent it with you.”

While there was no sangria 

in the park like Lou would 
have wanted, the morning 
started with a lukewarm 
shower, a long decision of 
what old man shirt I was going 
to start my college career 
with and an everything bagel, 
toasted, with cream cheese — 
everything I could have asked 
for.

As I took my first step out of 

South Quad, the summer air 
washed over me — nature’s 

way of saying “Way to go, 
Matt. You are so handsome 
and charming and you would 
never smash your cranium on 
a dirty lecture hall floor.”

Flash forward. I picked 

myself up and made my way 
to the third row (because you 
want to show you care but 
you don’t want to be a brown-
noser). 
As 
the 
professor 

made her way to the lectern, 
the mental prowess of post-
secondary education hit me.

In the wise words of 21th 

century philosopher April 
Ludgate: “Time is money, 
money is power, power is 
pizza, and pizza is knowledge, 
let’s go.”

Why don’t I just take every 

class ever? Money is not a 
constraint when the gift of 
knowledge abounds.

“How Much A Dollar Cost” 

— Kendrick Lamar

I’m going to major in 

Something-Something, take 
every prereq and optional 
course I can and stay here 
until I know everything there 
is to know about Something-
Something.

Intuition over tuition.

The professor did that little 

clearing-your-throat, 
I’ll-

wait, 
please-shut-the-hell-

up beginning of class thing. 
Everyone fell silent, opened 
their laptops and I prepared 
for the greatest first lecture of 
my life.

“Okay class. Welcome to 

Something-Something 
101. 

We’re gonna get started.”

And that’s when I felt lost.
“Lost Ones” — Ms. Lauryn 

Hill

What in the wide, wide 

world of sports is this woman 
talking about? I thought 
I knew what Something-
Something consisted of but 
this is nothing like the major 
description 
online. 
She’s 

talking too quickly. This 
lecture makes absolutely no 
sense, like when you say, “You 
too” when the movie theater 
attendant says, “Enjoy your 
movie”.

While the professor sped 

ahead, I was about eight slides 
back — how am I supposed 
to type that quickly? I never 
took one of those elementary 
school typing classes so I still 
peck the keyboard. It isn’t fair 

but I live with this academic 
disadvantage. 
Give 
me 
a 

medal, please.

By that point, I was freaking 

out. Was the lecture getting 
hotter or was it just me? 
(Not flirting, just genuinely 
sweaty.)

“Hot in Herre” — Nelly
My fingers were leaving 

balmy, gross marks on my 

keyboard. I felt my shirt 
getting noticeably damper 
than it was on the walk over 
from South Quad. Things 
are moving too quickly. I’m 
not ready to grow up. I can’t 
handle this large amount of 
information packed into 50 
minutes. How am I going to 
make my dad and mom and 
grandma’s brother’s uncle’s 
neighbor in West Palm Beach, 
Florida, 
proud 
without 

my 
Something-Something 

degree? I might as well waste 
away in an abyss of my own 
self-pity and Milano cookies.

35 
minutes 
in, 
I 
was 

drowning in slides and bullet 
points and offhand comments 
that might be on the exam. 
I was about to burst into 
flames.

“Man on Fire” — Edward 

Sharpe and the Magnetic 
Zeros

I was a shame. I was a fraud. 

I was a mess (well, I was a 
mess before this class but let’s 
let bygones be bygones).

The 50 minutes expired 

and everyone packed up 
their 
notebooks, 
laughing 

as they headed toward their 
next class. I sat still, lost in 
thought. I thought maybe 
Something-Something wasn’t 
my true calling. I felt like I 
was abandoning everything 
I had ever known to be true, 
but what else was I supposed 
to think? I was always so 
set on my future that I felt 
like I couldn’t quit without 
becoming a disappointment. 
But it was the only thing I 
could think of. How was I 
supposed to force myself 
into this major and career if I 
couldn’t even survive the first 
day?

I felt like I was stuck in a 

current, washing me away.

“In Undertow” — Alvvays
“You find a wave and try to 

hold on for as long as you can. 
You made a mistake you’d like 
to erase and I understand.”

Am I in too deep? Can you 

make such a drastic switch 
like this so quickly?

Yes you can.
It doesn’t matter if you 

thought you wanted to major 
in Something-Something or 
Yada-Yada or Who-Knows-
What. If you aren’t passionate 
about what you do, you 
need to find what you are 
passionate about and chase 
it. You know what you want. 
Not what your dad wants. 
Not what your mom wants. 
Not what your grandma’s 
brother’s uncle’s neighbor in 
West Palm Beach, Florida, 
wants. What you want.

You can’t force a puzzle 

piece into a space it doesn’t fit 
in. Everything’s Gucci, you’re 
A-OK, and it’s all right.

Right” — Bob Dylan

BEHIND THE LIE:

“It’s not alcoholism until you graduate”

b y A l e x a S t . J o h n, Managing News Editor
I

f I hadn’t already known that graduate 
student Ary — who requested her last 
name not be published — was recover-
ing from several years of alcohol and 

drug abuse, I wouldn’t have guessed it from 
her appearance. As we talked last Wednes-
day in my most comforting setting (the Daily 
newsroom) I quickly caught onto her dedi-
cation to her studies and noticed the bright 
smile on her face, much like that of any other 
student.

No matter the substance, college students 

in recovery look and act as any other: walk-
ing the halls in a backpack and jeans, a pony-
tail or baseball cap, a cell phone in one hand 
and a textbook or coffee in the other. With 
my own perception of those in recovery 
inundated by dramatized depictions in the 
media, I realized I would have no idea if the 
person sitting next to me in my 10 a.m. was 
going through the same challenges as Ary.

As I spoke with her, I was quickly remind-

ed those in recovery are just like anybody 
else — and the negative stereotypes and mis-
conceptions that plague these students are 
keeping them from seeking help.

The stigmas attached to addiction are 

harmful to the recovery process. Ary said 
when her recovery began in the winter of 
2015, she sought help with University of 
Michigan Counseling and Psychological Ser-
vices — but getting there first was difficult.

*****
Ary began drinking in high school and 

experimenting with various pills and other 
substances to overcome anxiety and depres-
sion upon entering the University, where her 
substance abuse spiraled out of control.

“The big thing for me most of my time 

here was Adderall,” she said, adding that she 
felt her depleting mental health and drug 
abuse were tied.

A therapist at CAPS recommended she try 

attending Contemplators, a student group 
for those interested in talking about issues 
of alcohol and drug abuse. Though Contem-
plators is no longer a student organization, 
it has been replaced by other resources on 
campus.

Ary recalls it was during one of these ses-

sions that she first admitted to herself she 
was an addict.

“What became really obvious to me after 

a few sessions of that is that, many of these 
people looked like they would be able to 
use the tools from the group to control or 
limit their drinking and using and for me, it 
became really clear that that just wasn’t pos-
sible,” she said.

She became afraid and stopped going to 

the group.

“That was scary. It was, ‘Fuck, I have this 

thing that is only going to get worse and it’s 
already pretty bad,’ and then also the stig-
ma of, ‘Now, if I ever want to treat it, that’s 
acknowledging it and therefore I get that 
label of being an addict,” Ary said. “At this 
point, I would just go on big benders of three, 
four, five, six days of not sleeping and then I’d 
be drinking around the clock to counterbal-
ance all the stimulants.”

Even still, she was able to graduate on 

time, with honors in her program. But her 
recovery journey continues even today.

*****
Alcohol abuse on college campuses has 

become 
increasingly 
commonplace. 
To 

many, substance abuse looks like extreme 
cases of fatality or assault. But for others 
it’s an everyday, binge-drinking session that 
results in months or years of hiding liquor 
bottles and trying to piece together count-
less forgotten nights.

Roughly one in four college students 

report academic consequences — ranging 
from decreases in grades to missing classes 
— from drinking, according to the National 
Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, 
and 20 percent of college students meet the 
criteria for an alcohol use disorder. Within 
the University of Michigan, a 2007 survey 
notes52 percent of undergraduates engaged 
in binge drinking within two weeks of being 
surveyed, as compared to 44 percent nation-
ally.

The abuse of opioids, opiates and prescrip-

tion medication has become more silent — 
yet is growing, and subsequently, becomes 
more dangerous. Opioids are synthetic 
drugs, while opiates are derived from the 
poppy plant.

Pill-sharing parties and a widespread 

opioid epidemic can quickly lead some to a 
vicious cycle of paying dealers and needing 
a fix, debt and overdose.

In August, President Donald Trump 

declared the opioid crisis a national state 
of emergency due to numbers stating the 
epidemic kills about 100 Americans daily. 
Even within Washtenaw County, opiate and 
opioid use has spiked, ultimately leading to 
the introduction of Naloxone — a life-saving 
drug capable of reversing the effects of an 
overdose — in police departments locally 
and nationwide. 

Social Work student David Awadalla told 

me how he first attended the University of 
Georgia, where he played on the lacrosse 

team until sustaining a sports-related injury.

Awadalla was prescribed opioid painkill-

ers, and at first, took them as prescribed.

“It made me comfortable in my own skin 

and I could study, or talk to my parents, or 
go out with friends and I felt confident,” 
Awadalla said. “Over time, my dependence 
on them grew and I started doing illegal 
things to obtain more pills.”

After two suspensions from the Universi-

ty of Georgia and spending time incarcerat-
ed, he was given another chance to graduate 
and then was accepted into the University 
of Michigan’s School of Social Work in fall 
of 2016. Last year, he interned with the Sub-
stance Abuse and Mental Health Services 
Administration within the U.S. Department 
of Health and Human Services. Awadalla 
has been helping others with similar issues 
ever since. 

*****
The more alcohol Ary consumed and the 

more drugs she took, the less she showed up 
to her post-graduation lab position on time, if 
at all. Her system stoked from so many stim-
ulants, Ary kept a bottle of gin next to her 
bed, slamming cupful after cupful every two 
hours to counterbalance the rush until 6 a.m.

After one final night abusing several sub-

stances, she sought an assessment from Uni-
versity Treatment Services — a division of 
Michigan Medicine’s psychiatric services.

“They had told me: ‘You’re definitely an 

addict and you’re definitely an alcoholic,’ 
and I was like, ‘Alcoholic? Everyone in col-
lege drinks like this, everyone’s grades suffer 
because of drinking, I only drink this much 
because I do too many drugs,’ ” Ary said.

She soon attended her first Alcoholics 

Anonymous meeting but suffered a relapse 
just 17 days later. Finally, a woman in one 
meeting told her about the Collegiate Recov-
ery Program, which aims to reduce the stig-
ma behind addiction and provides students 
with a supportive community in the recov-
ery process. Ary attended a meeting and has 
been sober for two and a half years since.

My first impression of LSA senior Mandy 

— who requested her last name remain anon-
ymous — was that she, too, was motivated in 
her school work and dedicated to helping 
others. Mandy had a similar experience, 
though she only seriously started drinking 
during Welcome Week her freshman year. 
For her, it rapidly became a bigger problem.

“I was nervous about being in a new place 

and insecure — I just felt more confident and 
it became this cure-all solution to every-
thing,” Mandy said. “I wasn’t 21 yet, but if I 
had been, it would have been literally all the 
time.”

Toward the end of her freshman year, 

Mandy went to meetings for AA and Stu-
dents for Recovery (a group similar to Con-
templators) in an attempt to curtail her habit. 
She found temporary relief, but she relapsed 
the following fall as academic and peer pres-
sures constantly loomed.

“I was trying so hard and was not able 

to do as well as I wanted, and of course the 
drinking didn’t help either,” Mandy said. 
“If I’m drinking before classes or missing 
class because I’m hungover, then I’d be upset 
about my grades so I would drink more or 
drink after an exam.”

Though she didn’t want to, Mandy with-

drew from the semester to take time off.

“I hated that I wouldn’t be graduating 

in four years and that I had to take time off 
and I thought I was a failure and all these 
things, but now, looking back, it was the best 
thing I could have done,” Mandy said. “I also 
thought I was better at hiding it than I was, 
but I definitely worried especially about my 
family finding out.”

“I just felt very lonely and isolated and 

I didn’t know how I would get through it 
or how I would turn 21 and stay sober,” she 
added.

This cycle of abuse continued until she met 

Matt Statman from the Collegiate Recovery 
Program when she returned to campus. The 
program changed everything regarding her 
recovery process.

*****
CRP was founded with the help of Wolver-

ine Wellness Director Mary Jo Desprez and a 
student in recovery, along with funding from 
UHS, CAPS and private donors. The CRP has 
introduced opportunities for sober events 
and recovery support to the University com-
munity. The CRP evolved from the Students 
for Recovery organization and has since 
become more accessible to the student body. 
Over the past year, for example, the group 
has held sober tailgates, birthday parties and 
a graduation for outgoing seniors.

Statman, director of the CRP, said the pro-

gram has helped hundreds of students cope 
with addiction. While alcohol and marijuana 
are the most commonly abused substances 
on the University of Michigan’s campus, the 
program has also seen students seeking help 
for opioid recovery.

One of Statman’s central goals is to ensure 

those in recovery feel comfortable with their 
environment — and through abstinence-
based programs, meetings and personalized 
recovery efforts — he believes recovery is a 
realistic goal.

“Primarily, what we’re designed to do is 

support students who are already embrac-
ing a recovery identity on campus,” Stat-
man said. “When you start to have a more 
visible recovery community, it’s attractive 
to people, especially people who are miser-
able with the status quo. If their relationship 
with substances is causing pain and misery, 
and they’re unable to change it on their own, 
being part of a community of students in 
recovery is attractive.”

Statman sees about 25 students regularly 

each semester, in addition to dozens who 
come for help on a less formal basis and gen-
erally need more direction as to where to 
start with their recovery process.

“My goal isn’t to get students sober, it’s 

to support those who are already sober and 
those who are highly motivated to make 
those changes that are required to get sober,” 
Statman said. “(It’s) really designed to sup-
port this very specific group of students who 
have this identity that is marginalized and 
often forgotten about.”

The peer support group within the CRP 

helps those in recovery cope with a campus 
culture that isn’t particularly conducive to 
recovery. Statman specifically singled out 
the high-pressure academic environment 

and unhealthy student behavior as drivers of 
this.

“For people in recovery, wellness might be 

especially important, because if they’re not 
taking care of their wellness, they are vul-
nerable to relapse. A culture like ours that 
places a value on being out of balance, not 
sleeping … that culture is also threatening,” 
Statman said. “We’re seeing huge numbers 
of students who are having a lot of emotional 
and mental health issues resulting from the 
culture on college campuses, and I think the 
idea that all that matters is academic success 
is harmful.”

Mandy — who was first enrolled in several 

demanding engineering courses — echoed 
Statman.

She added the stigma she first experienced 

while in recovery about a year ago has been 
somewhat removed as awareness has grown 
on campus. But she said she still believes 
there is a long way to go in terms of changing 
the negative misconceptions of those with 
addiction to spreading awareness about sub-
stance use and misuse.

“Hearing people talking about drinking 

and being like, ‘I’m such an alcoholic,’ and 
making light of it can be tough sometimes, 
and I’m just sitting there like — you have no 
idea,” Mandy said. “The saying, ‘It’s not alco-
holism until you graduate’ … it prevents peo-
ple from getting help sooner when they could 
use it or before things get more serious.”

*****
There are additional resources available 

on campus and locally for those struggling 
with a substance, or who just want informa-
tion on how to better manage their use.

Aside from individual wellness coaching 

made available through UHS, there’s the 
Alcohol and Other Drug Prevention Pro-
gram, Brief Alcohol Screening and Inter-
vention for College Students, the Individual 
Marijuana Education Program and the Ann 
Arbor Campus-Community Coalition, a 
resource for both students and Ann Arbor 
residents in recovery.

BASICS and IMEP interventions are 

shorter-term interventions — a two-session 
alcohol and two-session marijuana screen-
ing and education discussions, respectively 
— sometimes mandated by the Office of 
Student Conflict Resolution to those who 
committed a related offense on campus, but 
many also attend of their own accord.

And though the University has no specific 

housing for those in recovery, substance-
free housing is available upon request. These 
environments host additional support for 
students choosing not to engage in substance 
use, a step further from traditional on-cam-
pus housing.

At an event last November that promot-

ed an open dialogue on opioid addiction in 
Washtenaw County, Mark Albulov, a residen-
tial therapist at Dawn Farm — an Ypsilanti-
based nonprofit with an outpatient center in 
Ann Arbor geared toward long-term drug 
and alcohol recovery — discussed the signifi-
cance of labeling addiction as a serious medi-
cal concern. 

“We want to … educate people that it is a 

medical disease,” Albulov said. “It’s not a 

moral failure, it’s not a criminal behavior, it’s 
a medical disease that has treatment.”

Despite the different options, to many 

students on campus, the CRP has steadily 
remained the best avenue through which to 
recover.

LSA senior Sophie — who requested her 

last name remain anonymous — first got into 
recovery one year ago. This in itself wasn’t 
easy.

“I hit my bottom, dropped out of classes 

and dug a little deeper until I ended up going 
to treatment,” Sophie said. “When I dropped 
out, I really didn’t imagine coming back. I 
couldn’t imagine very far ahead at that point 
in my life.”

It was a challenge not only to reach out, 

but also to find a place to fit.

“You’re stuck between these two sides — 

where you’re in treatment, and everyone is 
just focused on getting a part-time job, and 
one day at a time, and then there’s the other 
side where there’s Michigan students where 
their resume is five pages long and I felt stuck 
in the middle,” she said.

At the CRP, however, Sophie said she 

found a home.

“It was totally acceptable and understand-

able and even an act of courage to have taken 
time off of school to get your head straight,” 
Sophie said. “I don’t think I found any other 
community at Michigan where that was the 
perception, because as an outsider, there is 
stigma and even before I went to treatment 
and didn’t think I had a problem, I thought 
that that was going to be the low point of my 
life.”

Awadalla, also an intern with the CRP, 

says it the program has been the most impor-
tant part of his recovery.

“It’s cool to be able to come into a room 

with a bunch of other students who all 
are trying to accomplish the same thing,” 
Awadalla said. “Whenever we start doubting 
ourselves, someone else picks us up.”

Awadalla said he embraces his experi-

ences to help others, noting addiction’s non-
discriminatory nature.

“It’s such a big part of my story that I can’t 

even try to hide it,” Awadalla said. “It doesn’t 
discriminate — it doesn’t matter what race 
you are, what gender you are, what sex you 

are, what orientation you are, what your 
socioeconomic status it, it affects every-
body.”

Many of those interviewed brought to 

light the question of using the word “addict.”

“The term ‘drug addict’ — yes, I’m a drug 

addict, but sometimes now even still there’s 
a part of my brain that justifies it,” Ary 
said. “There’s something in that term that’s 
uncomfortable to be associated with.”

Destigmatizing the word “addict” is 

important, and Statman offered up the 
option of saying an individual “has addic-
tion.” On the other hand, however, Statman 
noted the importance of allowing those in 
recovery to accept the identities they want to 
best recover.

LSA senior Heather Martin watched her 

sister’s health and well-being decline as her 
addiction to opiates spanned seven years, 
something that came to a rapid halt one day 
with a fatal overdose.

Martin first opened up to the Daily about 

her family’s story last October. Now, more 
than three years after her sister Angie’s 
death, Martin and her family continue to 
maintain the organization Angel Wings for 
Angie, created in her sister’s honor, to pro-
vide local support for those in recovery.

“How can we expect these people (to 

recover),” Martin said last year, “if everyone 
just keeps looking at them and telling them 
that they’re not going to be anything, that 
that is all they’re going to be labeled with?”

*****
Statman believes providing these recovery 

resources on campus is a necessity.

“We owe it to our students who have this 

disorder to provide support for them when 
they come to campus or return to campus. 
It’s an indispensable piece of the alcohol and 
drug puzzle,” he said.

And for these students, receiving these 

recovery 
resources 
largely 
determines 

whether they will relapse.

“The quality of my life is completely dif-

ferent now,” Ary said. “There’s a lot I need 
to do every day to maintain my sobriety, and 
now that’s just a part of my life, but just see-
ing how much things can and have improved 
for me in two and a half years makes me real-
ly excited about what’s going to happen.”

6B
From a celiac: I don’t like gluten-free people either

I 

wish this disease were as imagi-
nary as everyone thinks it is.”

Upon getting sick for the ump-

teenth time in the past six years, 

I’m now going to have to spend the next 
few hours not on my impending exam but 
instead curled into a fetal position in bed. 
People just don’t understand celiac dis-
ease and the medically required gluten-
free diet that accompanies it, and it’s not 
entirely their fault. Many have started 
to follow the diet because they believe 
it will help them lose weight, and peo-
ple like me with a medical diagnosis get 
grouped in with them. Recent popularity 
of the gluten-free diet has paved the way 
for a mass misunderstanding of what it is 
and its actual medical purpose — utter-
ly indistinct in the public eye from the 
Atkins diet. When I was diagnosed with 
celiac disease my sophomore year of col-
lege, all my anxiety around my diagnosis 
had nothing to do with the actual disease 
or its management but rather how I’d be 
perceived; how I’d go to restaurants, how 
I could communicate the severity of my 
dietary restrictions and not be imme-
diately mislabeled as a fad dieter, how I 
could ask for the things I needed and still 
save face. For the first year I refused to 
say “gluten-free,” opting instead for “celi-
ac food” or other variations because I 
hated how “gluten-free” sounded coming 
out of my mouth.

For context: Celiac disease is an auto-

immune disorder in which my body, 
instead of digesting the gluten protein 
(aka wheat, barley and rye), develops anti-
gens that attack my small intestine. As 
you can image, it’s not a fun process, and 
the side effects are as numerous as they 
are unpleasant. For me, it’s regular nau-
sea, vomiting, diarrhea, migraines, mouth 
sores, weight loss due to malabsorption 
of nutrients, severe cramping confin-
ing me to bed, lactose intolerance, two 
years of consistent colds due to a depleted 
immune system, hair loss, insomnia and 
constant and very noticeable bloating. 
And ingesting even the smallest bits of 
it (anything over 20 parts per million, 
literal bread crumbs) will set them off 
again. Not to mention that long-term 
disregard of celiac disease can lead to 
infertility, permanent digestive damage, 
malnutrition and a whole slew of other 
nasty diseases including, but not limited 
to, multiple sclerosis, lymphoma, diabe-
tes and epilepsy. Suddenly all that is good 
and beautiful in the world (pizza, bread, 
pasta) didn’t seem like too high of an ask-
ing price, considering the consequences. 
Not that I particularly had a choice.

Reactions to the news that I have celi-

ac disease range from “you’re so lucky 

you’re allergic to carbs” to “dude, you 
can’t drink beer? That’s lame.” Trust me, 
bro, I know. That I will never again taste 
the sweet bliss that is a lukewarm can of 
Rolling Rock keeps me up at night. When 
I was first diagnosed I had a reoccur-
ring dream where I would stand outside 
a Cinnabon and just look at the pretzels, 
sitting there gloriously. But these faded 
with time and made way for the deep and 
burning hatred I harbor for those who get 
giddy when I tell them because “OMG!!!! 
I’M GLUTEN-FREE TOO!!!!” The most 
aggravating comments I get are not from 
mostly well-meaning sympathizers but 
instead from people who elect to eat glu-
ten-free simply because they believe it 
is healthier, or as I like to refer to them, 
“fake gluten people.” These are not other 
people with medical aversions to the pro-
tein. These are the people who voluntari-
ly shop at Whole Foods, the ones who lord 
their salad-eating habits for all to see, the 

ones who turn up their noses at a perfect-
ly good 50-cent piece of pizza because it’s 
“dirty.” These are the people who love to 
complain to me about how difficult eat-
ing gluten-free is, how they’re constantly 
tempted, how they’re so excited to talk to 
someone who actually “gets it” for once. 
And I hate them, bitterly.

For “gluten-free” people do have a 

choice. They don’t have violent reac-
tions that land them in a hospital on 
their “cheat days” and they are allowed 
the occasional “sometimes I’m bad when 
I’m drunk and eat a slice of pizza! Tee 
hee!” because there are no consequences 
for them. But this attitude has very real 
consequences for people like me, aside 

from whatever (mountain of) personal 
annoyance that it may bring. In claim-
ing our medically required diet for them-
selves, they group us — celiacs and other 
non-celiac gluten intolerances — togeth-
er with them. The word “gluten-free” 
now has a societal connotation with the 
obnoxious trendy diet and nothing more. 
Half the time the server at a restaurant 
will roll her eyes when I ask about gluten-
free options, and for good reason — half 
the time she encounters a request for 
gluten-free foods it is most likely a volun-
tary one. But if a pan in the kitchen isn’t 
washed well enough, I’m out of commis-
sion, while fake gluten people don’t have 
to worry.

And however vocal all the fake gluten 

people are, I am equally as quiet; people 
with gastrointestinal diseases have dig-
nities, too, which is why most celiacs will 
give you a very shifty answer when you 
ask what happens when we eat gluten. 

We don’t want to talk about our diarrhea 
more than you don’t want to hear about 
it. The problem is, our shiftiness mini-
mizes our experience. And I get it; my 
senior year of high school, when a girl I 
knew got diagnosed with celiac disease, 
I thought she was a big giant phony. We 
eat bread our entire lives and then one 
day we’re severely allergic. It sounds 
sketchy. But what everyone can’t see is 
the years of chronic illness leading up 
to the diagnosis — the endless, fruitless 
doctors appointments where they tell you 
to cut out whatever food and ask you if 
you feel better a month later. The answer 
is always sorta, I don’t know, maybe. 
And the process starts over. All of this, 

coupled with the aforementioned lovely 
hipsters and bigorexic health nuts, have 
de-legitimized the severity of our aller-
gies, downgrading an autoimmune dis-
ease to a fad.

Twenty-something yoga enthusiasts 

around the country have since made a 
gluten-free diet the next trendy weight 
loss market, with the global gluten-free 
market growing from $1.7 billion in 2011 
to $3.5 billion in 2016. Overall consump-
tion of gluten-free foods by people who 
do not have celiac disease in the U.S. has 
more than tripled, from 0.52 percent of 
the population in 2010 to 1.69 percent in 
2014. This is all in spite of a slew of sci-
entific evidence that exposes real health 
detriments associated with following a 
gluten-free diet, that it will not help you 
lose weight nor is it inherently healthier, 
but instead is linked to a higher risk of 
obesity. I actually gained about 20 pounds 
after I went gluten-free. The reason peo-
ple may lose weight on the diet is that they 
end up eating fewer carbs, not specifi-
cally gluten. Gluten-free substitute foods 
are generally higher in saturated fats 
and sugars, as they tend to be made from 
starchier substances like white rice flour 
or potato starch than their whole wheat 
counterparts and rely on added sugars to 
make up for differences in taste. Addi-
tionally, 
already-expensive 
substitute 

grains like quinoa coupled with a sharp 
demand spike make gluten-free foods an 
average of 242 percent more expensive 
than their gluten-filled complements. For 
the people who elect the diet, it is a privi-
lege to give up most foods and replace 
them with an expensive, tasteless substi-
tute. They have the option of buying the 
cheaper wheat-filled version and instead 
elect for the more expensive gluten-free 
one. I do not have such luxuries. Think 
you’re struggling with funds buying 
69-cent packets of ramen noodles? You’re 
right. Now imagine you have to pay $6 for 
a loaf of bread. Worse, imagine electing 
to do so.

“Oh, I don’t have any real reason, I just 

feel better when I don’t eat it!” is one of 
my least favorite sentences in the English 
language. Contrary to popular belief, this 
diet is not a choice. And the people who 
do choose it for weight loss purposes or 
whatever other stupidity only reaffirm 
the “popular belief” that it is. So if you’re 
considering “going gluten-free,” just cut 
out carbs instead. Do all of us over here at 
Sad, Tasteless Headquarters a favor and 
stop going gluten-free for a week as a fun 
challenge. It won’t do anything. And, for 
the love of God, stop complaining about it 
on the internet. Let us deal with our dis-
eases in peace.

Personal Statement: 
 camping against cancer

I 

was given the name 
Annaka in 1998 in a hos-
pital in Jackson, Mich. 
In Palmer Commons 

19 years later, I was renamed, 
surrounded by 100 of my 
tie-dye-clad best friends. To 
the question “What is your 
favorite childhood movie?” I 
responded with “Monsters, 
Inc.” As ideas were shouted 
at me, I zeroed in on a sugges-
tion from the crowd: Roz. In 
that moment, I stepped foot 
into something that would fill 
me with joy and drastically 
alter the way I think about 
the career in oncology that I 
am pursuing.

The personal vendetta I 

hold against cancer extends 
far prior to my name change. 
It began when I saw my 
grandmother’s hair begin to 
thin for the first time, falling 
out in chunks until she finally 
decided to shave it off and put 
the scarves in her closet to a 
new use. It deepened as I later 
watched the fat slip from her 
bones, her body becoming 
skeletal and so delicate that 
even hugging her is now a task 
to be completed with great care. It turned 
into an obsession when she became too 
tired to lift her beloved paints to the 
blank canvases for which she’d planned 
scenes of lazy days in Ypsilanti and still-
lifes of her childhood in Escanaba. 

I made enemies of the cancerous cells 

within her; the woman whose impact on 
my life can conservatively be referred 
to as that of a third parent. A career as 
an oncologist became a goal to eclipse 
all others. Nights were spent reading 
articles, watching documentaries and 
googling unknown terms in an effort to 
better understand the thing I hated so 
much. Write-ups about immunotherapy 
and clinical trials dominate the favorites 
bar on my laptop. Dreams of patients in 
complete remission dance through my 
head when I sleep. 

Camp Kesem allowed me to confront 

illness from a different perspective. 
Rather than focusing on only the dis-
ease, Kesem fights to weaken the rippling 
effects that cancer has on loved ones of 
those diagnosed. Camp Kesem is an orga-
nization, staffed by college students, that 
provides a free week of summer camp to 

children with a parent affected by cancer. 

We strive to give our campers respite 

from holidays spent in hospitals, talk of 
treatment plans and nights spent worry-
ing about their parent’s health. This sup-
port extends throughout the rest of the 
year as well — counselors attend impor-
tant events, send birthday cards and even 
host camper-counselor reunions to keep 
in touch with our campers (and, admit-
tedly, satiate our own camp withdrawal). 
Before attending camp, I saw cancer as 
a single entity — spots upon the scans of 
people’s bones, breasts and lungs to be 
attacked with chemotherapy and radia-
tion. I viewed the affliction as one-dimen-
sional, not taking into consideration the 
children acting as caregivers to their own 
parents by completing household chores, 
dispensing medications, cooking meals 
and looking over their younger siblings. 
That quickly changed when I met my 
campers.

Within minutes of meeting them, I 

knew that this camp meant more to its 
campers than I could have imagined. My 
girls entered our cabin with huge smiles 
on their faces, running excitedly into the 

arms of old friends and introducing them-
selves to campers they’d never met before. 
They talked about memories of camps 
past and eagerly wondered about the 
memories that would be made this year. 
Under this year’s theme, “The Wonderful 
World of Kesem,” the University of Mich-
igan’s chapter of Camp Kesem provided 
260 campers with activities inspired by 
superheroes, Harry Potter, pirates and 
Disney movies, as well as more tradition-
al camp pastimes, like canoeing, arts and 
crafts, swimming and (my personal favor-
ite) frog hunting. 

I felt goosebumps dot my arms as chil-

dren as young as 6-year-olds bravely 
spoke about their experiences with can-
cer, exhibiting more poise and clarity 
than I possess as an adult. I laughed as my 
fellow counselor Maple waded waist-deep 
into a swamp so a camper could catch a 
frog on his birthday. I sang and danced to 
songs about jellyfish, bananas and bur-
ritos. I cried when a camper told me she 
liked spending time with me because I 
reminded her of her deceased father.

Camp is a place where children who feel 

alone in their struggles can create life-

long bonds with other kids who 
share many of the same experi-
ences, and with counselors who 
truly care about them. The fun 
we have and the connections we 
create allow our campers to take 
a week to just be kids and forget 
about the troubles and responsi-
bilities that affect them at home.

Additionally, 
Kesem 
has 

allowed me to forge friendships 
with people whom I would never 
have otherwise. My friends can 
be found marching with the 
band at football games, hitting 
the lanes with the club bowl-
ing team, playing bass in rock 
‘n’ roll bands, beginning careers 
as teachers in places as far away 
as Austria and working in sev-
eral of the University’s many 
research labs. Counselors ate 
ghost peppers, posted embar-
rassing pictures of themselves 
and bleached their hair to raise 
money for Kesem. I had friends 
attend funerals, make blankets 
and attend doctors appointments 
for campers going through hard 
times. These people have shown 
me levels of love and compassion 
that I would never have known 
without Kesem, and have also 

felt the transformative power of camp 
reverberate through their lives. 

When people ask about my favorite 

part of attending the University, I quickly 
jump to stories of kids dumping buckets of 
water on their unsuspecting counselors. I 
run at the opportunity to tell about the 
dreamcatcher that a 6-year-old camper 
made for me and delivered to me at lunch. 
I tear up every time I try to articulate the 
magic that breaks through the air when a 
shy child opens up for the first time. 

Years from now, when I’m (hopefully) 

practicing as an oncologist, I’ll look back 
on these days and know that I will not be 
doing my job to the best of my ability if I 
am not offering support to the families of 
my patients. I will do everything I can to 
make the treatment process understand-
able, provide access to information about 
counseling services and, most important-
ly, let them know that their feelings and 
emotions are being considered through-
out their loved ones’ battles. As future Dr. 
Saari, I will do my best to offer the high-
est level of care possible to my patients. 
As Roz, I will make sure that those closest 
to my patients will never feel alone.

On September 14 and 17, I photographed two Michigan women’s soccer games 
— one against Purdue and the other against Indiana. It was an incredible feeling 

to be back shooting sports again. I started the fall 2016 semester shooting 
women’s soccer, and it felt like I was coming full circle for my last year at the 

Daily. One of my favorite things about covering sports isn’t necessarily the peak 
actions themselves but rather the intimate moments in between plays. Here are 

some of my favorite frames from this past week.
