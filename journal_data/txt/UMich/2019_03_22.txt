Max Tsao, Music, Theatre & Dance 

junior, was working in Mason Hall with 

other students Saturday afternoon when 

the first reports of an active shooter on 

the University of Michigan’s Central 

Campus were publicized. In one of the 

student’s group chats, at approximately 

4:44 p.m., one student alerted the group 

“There’s an active shooter near Mason.” 

Many students responded to the text 

in confusion, one asking “How am I 

supposed to get to work?” and another, 

“Do you know if anyone got hurt?”

One student texted, “Apparently the 

suspect moving towards UGLi. Please 

leave Central.” From there, one student 

shared the link to the Washtenaw Sheriff 

Office’s police scanner. 

Many students said there were 

reports the shooter was going toward the 

Brown Jug. Another said “three shooters 

total” with a screenshot of a different 

group message, while another said “two 

in custody.” In this group chat, there 

were messages of “someone got shot” 

and “white man holding gun.”

This group chat began discussing the 

incident about 20 minutes before the first 

alert from the University’s alert system. 

Saturday’s 
events 
spurred 

widespread confusion, and multiple 

students have found the experience 

to have exposed weaknesses in the 

University’s emergency protocols as well 

as how quickly information can spread 

on campus through informal channels 

in times of crisis. The Daily reviewed 

emergency protocols, University systems 

and training and personal experiences 

to look at the day’s events and what 

they mean in a nation plagued by gun 

violence.

I. From DPSS’ perspective

Melissa Overton, deputy chief of 

police and public information officer 

for the Division of Public Safety and 

Security, said in terms of the response 

from local law enforcement, the situation 

was handled well. She commended the 

collaboration of the various agencies, 

including 
Ann 
Arbor 
Police 
and 

Washtenaw County Sheriff’s Office, 

in the area and the reactions from the 

community.

“We were very lucky that we had 

staff already out at the location of the 

incident and we were there so quickly,” 

Overton said. “We couldn’t be happier 

with the response from the community, 

the neighboring agencies, because if this 

ended up being a real situation, this is 

exactly what we would hope for.”

On Thursday night, Paani at 
the University of Michigan, a 
non-profit organization, hosted 
“Ripple Effect,” its first annual 
banquet and largest event yet 
with around 180 people in 
attendance. The event focused 
on the water and sanitation crisis 
in Pakistan as well as the U.S., 
and included speeches from Dr. 
Mohammed Amjad Saqib and and 
Abdul El-Sayed.

The event brought in an equal 
mix of students and community 
members. 
Paani 
aimed 
to 
bring awareness to the water 
crisis, create a space to discuss 
innovative solutions and educate 
the attendees about how they can 
get involved with aiding the crisis 
from over 7,000 miles away.
Paani’s 
executive 
board 
began the banquet by discussing 
their past initiatives to draw 
attention to their club. Numerous 
fundraising events later, they 
secured over $2,000 to donate 

towards feminine hygiene and 
sanitation 
kits 
for 
Pakistani 
citizens. 
Since 
then, 
they’ve 
collaborated with several student 
organizations 
on 
campus 
to 
unite cultures and to expand the 
dialogue of their organization.
Paani members also mentioned 
their online journal dedicated to 
sharing Pakistani stories of water 
crisis experiences. To recognize 
the intersectionality of the issue, 
they also included stories about 
water sanitation issues from 
other countries to highlight the 

global emergency. Faraz Longi, 
Paani director of partnerships, 
also shared a story of his visit to 
Pakistan.
“We are no better than the 
people we’re helping,” Longi said. 
“We are here at the University of 
Michigan drinking clean water 
only by luck. Therefore, it’s our 
duty to help these people. That’s 
why Paani strives to through 
events like these.”
The University of Michigan 
Residence 
Halls 
Association 
hosted their weekly meeting on 
Thursday evening in the Couzens 
Residence 
Hall 
multipurpose 
room. The major highlight of the 
night was a presentation from 
Bryan Baker, DPSS lieutenant 
and liaison to the Division of 
Student Life, about how to handle 
events similar to Saturday’s active 
attacker scare.
Baker was originally scheduled 
to talk for twenty minutes, but 
the concerns of RHA assembly 
took up over ninety minutes of the 
meeting.
One RHA member brought 
up her concern of not receiving 
information from the University. 
Instead, she found out most of 
her information through group 
messages and social media. Baker 
addressed this issue and expressed 
his 
concern 
over 
students 
receiving inaccurate information.
“Information from unverified 
sources should not be shared,” 
Baker said.

Potential program draws controversy for

Demonstrators, 
acting 
in 
solidarity 
with 
those 
who 
participated in last week’s Climate 
Strike and subsequent sit-in, began 
an indefinite study-in at 8 a.m. in 
the Office of the President in the 
Fleming Administrative Building 
Thursday afternoon. About 15 
demonstrators 
were 
present 
at 2 p.m. and plan to stay until 
University of Michigan President 
Mark Schlissel commits to carbon 
neutrality by the year 2030.
LSA 
sophomore 
Solomon 
Medintz, an Opinion columnist at 
The Daily, said this event was not 
a continuation of last week’s sit-in, 
which resulted in 10 arrests Friday 
night. He said protestors will come 
in at 8 a.m. when the building opens 
and leave at 5 p.m. when it closes 
every day until their demands are 
met.
“We didn’t get what we asked 
for — at all,” Mednitz said. “We got 
none of it. We’re not doing anything 
illegal by sitting here, and we’ll leave 
when they ask us to, but we’ll be back 
in the morning, every morning.”
On 
Friday,

The University of Michigan’s 
English 
Department 
voted 
Wednesday to support the 
creation 
of 
a 
new 
minor 
focused on narrative arts and 
creative nonfiction. The minor 
was originally proposed as a 
journalism minor, though the 
final iteration includes a broader 
curriculum.
After 
this 
initial 
voice 
of support by the English 
Department, the draft proposal 
will continue to be updated and 
refined, leading to an eventual 
viewing 
and 
consideration 
made by the LSA Curriculum 
Committee.
The minor, which originated 
with student interest in taking 
more journalism and creative 
non-fiction courses, has caused 
internal 
debate 
within 
the 
English department, specifically 
on its disclusion of the term 
“journalism.”
English lecturer Will Potter 
has been working with the 

University’s Office of Academic 
Innovation, where he is a fellow in 
digital storytelling, to implement 
a program in journalism at the 
University. The Narrative Arts 
minor grew out of Potter and 
other 
professors’ 
journalism 
minor proposal. After working 
with the English Department 
and the Office of Academic 
Innovation to develop stronger 
journalism-related educational 
path at the University, Potter 
said he and his colleagues were 
shocked to hear their idea 
had been transformed by the 
department into a proposed 
minor in “Narrative Arts,” an 
ambiguous title excluding the 
word “journalism.”
“The new minor, as presented 
by leadership in the English 
department, 
is 
explicitly 
rejecting 
even 
the 
term 
‘journalism,’” Potter said. “We 
have all been very surprised 
at this change in direction … 
even the English Department 
faculty who have joined me in 
this conversation from the start.

LSA freshman Claire Hao on covering “Solidarity vigil for New Zealand 
mosques shooting held in Diag, interrupted early due to false active 
shooter threat”:

“I think covering this story really made me realize that I was a guest to the event. Every 
event I go to I have that sensation but this one especially. For one, I knew I should not 
live tweet this event. I cannot live tweet somebody’s grief and somebody’s fear and 
somebody’s mourning. Especially then, it was important for me to be present in the 
moment, and to be there not only as a reporter, but to also grieve and mourn and show 
solidarity just like everybody else who was there.”

“I think it’s such a huge shame that this event was disrupted, this event deserved coverage 
on its own for the event itself. I wanted to make the disruption of the event as small a part 
of the story as I could, because in the end, this was supposed to be a space for healing 
and sharing and solidarity, and that had already been interrupted once. I tried in my article 
to just use as many quotes as I could and to minimize summary, because I thought the 
speakers had beautiful things to say, and it would just be such a better reflection of the 
article if I did as little work as possible and let the quotes speak for themselves.”

QUOTE OF THE WE E K 

 After these events, it has become clear that we need to 
develop direct protocols for breaking news events that 
potentially threaten public safety. Our promise to our readers 
is that we will be better prepared if another incident of this 
gravity occurs in the University or Ann Arbor community. The 
Daily has consulted other media outlets for advice and tips and 
will continue to discuss different facets of our new protocols 
with professionals and members of our community.”

IT’S MY B-DAY
puzzle by sudokusyndication.com

“

Overton said the main goal of 

officers is to get to the scene is quickly 

as possible and then, as soon as the 

officers are dispatched, the emergency 

alert is sent out. Some may have gotten 

it sooner than others — notably, doctors 

may have been notified prior to others 

on campus.

Regarding the communication of 

different law enforcement agencies, 

Overton said everyone trains together 

for these scenarios and signs a mutual 

aid agreement. At a site, there is an 

incident commander in charge of 

all agencies helping to investigate 

the situation. Everything happens 

through this person in order to ease 

communication 
and 
coordination, 

according to Overton.

When an incident like this occurs, 

DPSS 
utilizes 
their 
campus-wide 

emergency alert system. Students, 

faculty and staff can sign up for voice 

message and text message alerts, and in 

theory, everyone in the University email 

system receives these alerts via email.

DPSS started receiving reports of 

a potential active shooter at 4:35 p.m., 

according to a statement from the Office 

of Public Affairs. DPSS’ first email alert 

urging campus to “run, hide, fight” 

came at 5:06 p.m.

However, LSA sophomore Sumaya 

Tabbah, a member of the DPSS student 

advisory board and of the Muslim 

Students’ Association, said she did not 

receive any email notifications at all.

“For the emails, I didn’t even get an 

email, which is concerning,” Tabbah 

said.

Overton said DPSS has received 

many of these complaints of people 

receiving delayed alerts or receiving 

none, and is currently analyzing its 

system to figure out why this happened.

“We did receive multiple complaints 

on the system,” Overton said. “ … We are 

aware that some of the alerts took a lot 

longer than they should have, and we 

are looking into that.”

Overton urged people to download 

DPSS’ app, which is geared more 

toward alerts and push notifications. 

Business senior Elizabeth Fakhoury, 

chair of DPSS Student Advisory Board, 

said the board has been working with 

DPSS to promote the app and better 

configure it for students. She noted the 

student-DPSS disconnect has been a 

focus since the board’s inception.

“Not signing up for alerts and being 

in the know-how is what we were 

tackling within the last year, and so 

DPSS created a Facebook page to update 

students on what’s going on and so 

through all of this, they were updating 

the alerts and they were saying you 

can sign onto emergency alerts here,” 

Fakhoury said.

Currently, the emergency alerts via 

text are received via an opt-in system. 

Students, faculty and staff do not receive 

these unless they explicitly sign up. 

Overton said DPSS has recommended 

transitioning to an opt-out system for 

years, but that this decision is ultimately 

up to a higher University authority.

Tabbah said she and other Muslim 

leaders on campus met with University 

President Mark Schlissel Wednesday 

morning to discuss some of these issues. 

She said making the alerts an opt-out 

system is a question they raised.

“But for the text messages, we 

asked Schlissel this morning why is it 

an opt-in system instead of an opt-out 

system,” Tabbah said. “It should be 

you’re automatically signed up for it 

and then if you feel like you don’t want 

to get those then you should opt-out, 

instead of putting the responsibility on 

the students.”

According to Tabbah, Schlissel’s 

response was that in the past, they had 

to make it opt-in due to complications 

with legality. Tabbah said Schlissel 

speculated that pay-per-text phone 

plans may have been the reason.

II. 
The 
spread 
of 
(mis)

information

Michael Colegrove, a college safety 

consultant, said when there is a gap in 

time between an incident and when 

there is official information released, 

people 
cling 
onto 
information, 

regardless if it is verified or not.

“The need for almost instantaneous 

communication is necessary, especially 

communication from a known source,” 

Colegrove said. “What happens if you 

have a gap that exists between the 

time of the incident and the time the 

word gets out from an official source 

— that vacuum is filled with a lot of 

misinformation.”

This unverified information spread 

rapidly 
across 
campus, 
giving 

different people unique experiences.

Standing on the steps of the 

Graduate 
Library 
reading 
her 

poem at the vigil commemorating 

the lives of people killed in the 

New Zealand mosques shooting, 

Fadwa Ashur, a student at Eastern 

Michigan University, saw the two 

police officers running towards the 

Diag before she heard them. DPSS 

had been at the event already, as 

organizers knew this was an event 

that could potentially attract hate 

and violence. When the police yelled 

repeatedly at the crowd to move, she 

ran with friends into the Graduate 

Library, where they stayed for two 

hours.

Since she was not University-

affiliated, she did not sign up for 

or receive the DPSS alerts. In the 

Graduate Library, Ashur discovered 

her phone had no cell service and 

could not connect to the University’s 

internet network. According to 

Ashur, she received information 

from a TV in the room they were in.

“There was a TV in the middle 

of the room (I was in) that showed 

the three alerts, (my friends and 

I) got (the alerts) through that,” 

Ashur said. “I don’t know about 

other people, but I couldn’t connect to 

MGuest so I didn’t have Internet, and I 

had no network… I couldn’t call anyone 

through my phone. I couldn’t even 

reach out to my family or anything… 

That was the scariest part.” 

Ashur explained she and her friends 

saw police officers running nearby 

about one hour into hiding after they 

had taken refuge in the Graduate 

Library. The officers were responding 

to a false fire alarm; however, Ashur 

said she and her friends had no way of 

knowing this. Based on the alerts they 

had seen, Ahsur said they assumed the 

police were responding to an active 

shooter.

At 5:28 p.m., in a video obtained by 

The Daily, an announcement can be 

heard informing students of the false 

fire alarm. The announcement also 

said the shooter was unconfirmed and 

told students they could either stay in 

the Graduate Library or leave. Ashur 

expressed she felt the announcement 

could not confirm they would be safe 

leaving, so she and her friends stayed in 

the Graduate Library.

“My friends and I stayed (in 

Hatcher), and I think only a couple of 

people left,” Ashur said. “Because that 

(announcement) was not reassuring… 

‘Unconfirmed’ means they did not tell 

us whether or not there was a shooter. 

We stayed there, we were like we’re not 

going to risk leaving.”

LSA senior Brendon Cho expressed 

confusion at this announcement. He 

heard people inside the Graduate 

Library were told to stay put, while the 

police scanner speakers were saying 

they should evacuate.

“From what I’m told there were 

conflicting reports from the police and 

the police radio, as well as from the 

announcement they had in Hatcher,” 

Cho said. “Apparently the police really 

wanted everyone to clear from the 

Hatcher building, but they were told by 

the PA system to kind of stay there and 

hunker down at Hatcher, so it was kind 

of hard to find who was really right and 

who to trust.”

University alum Brittney Williams, 

who was in town visiting on Saturday, 

voiced her disappointment with the 

University’s communication protocol 

in a tweet that as of publication has 

received 200 likes and 28 retweets. In 

an interview with The Daily, Williams 

further 
questioned 
why 
certain 

staff members received phone calls 

immediately while other staff and 

students didn’t.

“(The University’s communication 

protocol) 
was 
mindblowing, 
in 

particular because the people (my 

friends and I) were checking in on 

while we were waiting for an official 

alert were current students, who in my 

opinion should’ve known pretty much 

immediately,” Williams said. 

ALERT

See ALERT, Page 3


“And also staff who work directly 

with students in res (sic) life… especially 

directors of halls close to the incident, 

they didn’t receive those calls. But the 

(IT employee) I know on staff doesn’t 

work directly with students at all and 

they received that phone call. That was 

upsetting for me.”

On North Campus, LSA freshman 

Alexandra Dortzbach was in Bursley 

Residence Hall when text messages 

started streaming in. Dortzbach said 

she heard about the potential active 

shooter situation through multiple 

group chats about 30 minutes before 

receiving a push notification alert 

through the University of Michigan 

app.

Dortzbach expressed activity on 

North Campus seemed minimally 

affected by the active shooter threat.

“I’d say it was business as normal,” 

Dortzbach said. “We felt pretty 

removed. There was just a lot of talk 

and speculation about what was going 

on … all panic I saw was on behalf of 

people on Central Campus and their 

friends. None of it was about something 

actually occurring on North Campus.”

Sonya 
Lewis, 
Medical 
School 

instructor 
and 
member 
of 
the 

executive committee of Physicians for 

the Prevention of Gun Violence, was 

in the Diag just before the incident, 

attending the Women’s March. She 

said people got alerts before she did 

and she did not know what was going 

on until her daughter’s friend told her, 

and the misinformation being spread 

contributed to her confusion and fear.

“Because these mass shootings are 

so common in our society, it didn’t seem 

outlandish, it didn’t seem like we were 

overreacting, it seemed — with the 

information we were getting — very, 

very real, and our fear was very real,” 

Lewis said.

Lewis also said throughout the 

incident, she was receiving conflicting 

reports. She noted people attributing 

it to balloon popping, a report from 

The Daily Twitter account of multiple 

students wounded — which was later 

deleted and apologized for — and stories 

of different shooters in different places.

“We started seeing things about 

balloons and that it wasn’t really a gun 

situation,” Lewis said. “These things 

were happening in parallel with tweets 

about people being wounded and stuff 

like that. It was very hard to know what 

was actually happening.”

Ashur expressed the University’s 

alert system especially affects the Arab 

and Muslim community and wants the 

University to specifically apologize to 

these communities.

“I want the University of Michigan 

just to acknowledge ‘We were not clear 

during this situation,’” Ashur said. “There 

was a general statement of ‘Everyone 

has suffered, here’s some counseling.’ 

But people who were struggling to hold 

onto their identity of Arab, Muslim, and 

American … University of Michigan is 

not acknowledging we are suffering 

the most. … There was a failure on (the 

University’s) part, why not just say, 

‘You guys not only suffered after what 

happened in New Zealand, you suffered 

once again in this (active shooter scare) 

and we are so sincerely apologetic.’”

III. Run, hide, fight

LSA sophomore Soraya Zrikem ran 

from the Diag to the Law Quad when 

police interrupted the vigil, ultimately 

separating her from her mother and 

godmother, who had attended the vigil 

with her. Once in the Law Quad, she said 

employees did a good job of making sure 

there were barricades, but were unable 

to answer important questions.

Zrikem holds an on-campus job 

overseeing a study space and said she 

received no training for emergency 

events like what took place Saturday. 

However, she said she was aware of 

some faculty who did.

“While most of the time when you’re 

monitoring those spaces, not a lot is 

expected of you, if there is an emergency, 

you are the person that needs to be 

able to lead that group automatically, 

otherwise panic will ensue,” Zrikem 

said. “I don’t think it should be expected 

of me — as a random student — to know 

where a safe space is in all of my school 

buildings. That’s just not reasonable, 

and it would just be a lot to expect out 

of students, so at least employees should 

have that.”

An FBI study found the majority of 

shootings last less than five minutes. 

The study also exerted said civilians 

should be well-trained because many 

end before police arrive.

The slogan “Run, Hide, Fight” 

was created as a protocol for people 

in active shooter situations. It is on 

DPSS web pages related to active 

shooter preparedness and was included 

in a message from the alert system 

on Saturday. This slogan is widely 

considered a universal practice for 

active shooter situations, according to 

Cosgrove.

According to a Department of 

Homeland Security document, run, the 

first step, means flee the scene if you 

can. Hide, the next step, means find a 

place that’s out of the attacker’s sight 

while remaining quiet and to create 

a barricade if possible. The final step, 

fight, means to find an object to use as 

a weapon — such as a fire extinguisher, 

backpack, book or chair — and attempt 

to incapacitate the attacker as the last 

resort.

However, not everyone in the 

community was aware of this protocol 

before the incident. Williams said 

she thought the “Run, Hide, Fight” 

portion of this alert lacked clarification, 

especially since some students may not 

have understood the instructions given 

without context.

“The (Run, Hide, Fight) notification 

just added to what was turning into 

mass 
hysteria 
in 
that 
moment,” 

Williams said. “People are already 

anxious because they don’t know what’s 

going on, now they receive a formal 

notification that there is some sort of 

incident, whether unconfirmed or not, 

and what they’re instructed to do has 

no clarification. … Three of the people 

in the room (with me) were in a group 

chat with a lot of students in it, and a 

lot of the responses in the chat were 

like ‘What does ‘Run, Hide, Fight’ even 

mean?’”

Currently, DPSS requires students to 

watch an active shooter safety training 

video during orientation. Beyond that, 

University community members can 

request training workshops by going to 

the Presentations and Training section 

under 
Prevention 
and 
Education 

on DPSS’ website. Overton said the 

decision to make other training sessions 

mandatory would have to come from a 

higher University authority.

Fakhoury said the advisory board 

has been discussing further mandatory 

training, but brought up the point 

that students may be less interested 

in required courses. She highlighted 

DPSS’ capable guardian course — a 

training meant for people who want 

to be able to step up in an emergency 

situation.

“Looking into what the capable 

guardian is, it really fits those people 

who have that vested interest, so 

possibly marketing it more to those 

freshmen and other people who have an 

interest is something that we can look 

at,” Fakhoury said.

This issue of getting all students to 

engage with safety training is a large 

obstacle for DPSS, Tabbah said.

“How do we get all of the students 

this general training, and something 

that they don’t forget after freshman 

orientation,” Tabbah said. “I think 

that’s in general DPSS’ biggest struggle 

with students — how do you get them to 

care about safety when it’s not usually 

our number one priority?”

Overton acknowledged the video 

may not resonate with incoming 

freshmen who are already getting 

bombarded 
with 
information 
at 

orientation. However, she encouraged 

students and other University affiliates 

to sign up for training, as many officers 

are readily available to conduct them.

Zrikem 
said 
it 
is 
important 

employees are ready to take action 

in emergencies and, depending on 

location, know how to get information 

from superiors. She also noted how 

DPSS was called in for the vigil because 

organizers knew this could be a space 

that could attract hate, so she hopes this 

is a learning experience for them.

“If I was an employee in Mason, 

I should not be waiting to hear what 

higher-ups are telling me — I should 

know exactly how to respond in these 

types of emergencies,” Zrikem said. 

“In places that were farther away from 

the immediate panic zone, higher-ups 

should’ve been more in conversation 

with them, but I think that in the places 

close by, it was important people knew 

Demonstrators had no plan 
to leave until Schlissel agreed 
to a one-hour public meeting in 
which questions regarding the 
University’s plan to address climate 
change and carbon neutrality were 
not screened beforehand. Medintz 
noted they changed their demand 
from the public meeting to a full 
commitment to a transition to 
carbon neutrality by 2030.
After seven and a half hours in 
and around the Administration 
Building, 
Washtenaw 
County 
Climate Strike demonstrators left 
the area at approximately 9:30 
p.m. 
Friday. 
Melissa 
Overton, 
deputy chief of police and public 
information officer for the Division 
of Public Safety and Security, wrote 
in a message to The Daily stating 
10 demonstrators — including two 
minors — chose to remain in the 
building after multiple warnings. 
The 10 were arrested and given 
citations for trespassing, and the 
minors were held inside until their 
guardians arrived, Overton wrote.
Along with issues regarding 
citations, students have also voiced 
concern over the composition of the 
President’s Commission on Carbon 
Neutrality. 
However, 
Schlissel 
addressed this matter. 
In a monthly interview with 
The Daily last week, Schlissel said 
this person is one of two members 
from major energy corporations, 
making them a minority on the 
16-person commission. Schlissel 
also said the two corporations, DTE 
and Consumers Energy, have a 
personal incentive to improve their 
sustainability practices.
“I quite purposefully asked 
those two major energy companies 
to suggest someone they thought 
would 
be 
helpful, 
and 
the 
reason why is they provide the 
overwhelming amount of energy 
throughout our state and region 
and to say we don’t want to hear 
their thoughts and learn their 
plans because of their emissions 
of greenhouse gas,” Schlissel said. 
“They’re not going away, they are 
the major suppliers of electricity 
for the University, the city of Ann 
Arbor, et cetera., so ignoring them 
because of past behavior, I don’t 
think that serves any purpose.”
The Climate Strike was part 
of a youth-led global movement 
calling for action on climate change. 
Organizers estimated 2,500 to 3,000 
attended the Washtenaw County 
rally in the Diag at noon, which led 
to a march to the Administration 
Building and the sit-in.
In a statement about last Friday’s 
events, University spokesman Rick 
Fitzgerald wrote that Schlissel 
shares students’ concerns and 
encouraged anyone interested to 
attend the Commission on Carbon 
Neutrality’s town hall meetings.
“We appreciate the urgency 
our 
students 
feel 
regarding 
climate 
change,” 
Fitzgerald 
wrote. “President Mark Schlissel 
shares that sense of urgency. 
President Schlissel has committed 
the campus to carbon neutrality 
and has appointed a special 
commission to explore a pathway 
to achieving that goal including 
solutions to climate change that 
go well beyond the borders of the 
campus. That critical work is now 
under way.”
As a University with a lot of 
resources, Taubman sophomore 
Josh Kuh said it is important 
to 
keep 
pressure 
on 
the 
administration because climate 
change and carbon neutrality are 
major issues. He also said he came 
to the study-in to show support of 
the demonstrators’ requests.
Kuh said it’s time for the 
University to “walk the walk” and 
events like the study-in are ways 
to create change.
“Events 
like 
marches 
and 
strikes are really good — they’re 
powerful in the moment — but 
they don’t always have a lasting 
impact,” Kuh said. “It’s not always 
the flashiest thing and the most 
exciting thing in the moment that 
ends up having the most change 
or the biggest effect, so I think 
something like this … and that 
continued pressure might be more 
important in the long run.”
In a statement Thursday evening 
to The Daily, Fitzgerald wrote that 
Schlissel met with several Climate 
Action Movement members and 
discussed their concerns during his 
open student office hours on Feb. 28. 
Fitzgerald also noted the president’s 
commission co-chairs met with 
Climate 
Action 
Committee 
members on Feb. 27.

Journalism is not a dirty word, 
period.”
English 
Department 
Chair 
David Porter made it clear the 
potential new minor would not 
be a journalism program, even 
though the descriptions of the 
potential minor provided to The 
Daily include such terminology. 
According to Porter, efforts have 
not been made to rejuvenate the 
journalism program that closed 
nearly 90 years ago.
“Michigan used to have a 
journalism program that closed 
decades ago and there really 
hasn’t been any effort to replace 
that,” Porter said. “What we’re 
talking about is not intended to, by 
any means, replicate or duplicate 
or replace something like a 
traditional journalism program 
… in fact, we’ve largely avoided 
the use of the term ‘journalism’ 
and sought to think about the 
program more capaciously.”
Instead of being explicitly 
about journalism, Porter wrote 
that the Narrative Arts minor, 
if conceived, is intended to be 
interdepartmental, echoing the 
structural goals of the Social Class 
and Inequality Studies minor as 
well as the Digital Studies minor. 
“(The minor is) designed to 
provide students interested in 
careers 
involving 
journalism 
(and story-making more broadly) 
structured opportunities to study 

the history, theory and craft of a 
variety of nonfiction narrative 
forms, 
including 
long-form/
literary journalism, travel writing, 
memoir and ethnography,” Porter 
wrote in an email interview with 
The Daily.
The University’s relationship 
with journalism education and 
a curriculum surrounding the 
profession is long and complex. 
The 
Communication 
Studies 
Department began as “English 
Language and Literature” in 
1869, and after multiple name 
changes, 
became 
“Rhetoric 
and Journalism” in 1921. Eight 
years 
later, 
the 
department 
was 
referred 
to 
as 
simply 
“Journalism,” but dropped the 
word “journalism” from its name 
in 1932 and has not re-adopted 
it since. The Communication 
Studies Department, as it is 
currently named, formed in 1995.
There have been recent efforts 
in the English Department to 
enhance the journalism courses 
and 
opportunities 
available 
to 
students. 
The 
English 
Department added a new page to 
their website announcing their 
new summer internship program 
in journalism. According to the 
website, the department will offer 
funding for at least five applicants 
to complete a summer internship 
at a media outlet in the Detroit 
or Ann Arbor area. While this 
announcement implies support 
for journalism education from the 
English Department, Porter said 
including the word “journalism” 

in the new minor would isolate 
stakeholders in the department, 
resulting in a rejection of the 
initial proposal.
“A department like ours has 
many different constituencies 
and many different stakeholders, 
and trying to do something 
new requires (using rhetorical 
strategies) that everyone can get 
on board with and that try to 
avoid significantly antagonizing 
one group or another,” Porter 
said. “Had this proposal been 
pitched as primarily a journalistic 
undertaking, 
it 
would 
have 
deeply antagonized a significant 
subset of the department and 
the powerful subset of the 
department.”
Discussion about the minor 
began 
when 
students 
asked 
their professors if more classes 
were available in the realms 
of 
journalism 
and 
creative 
nonfiction writing. According 
to Porter, the potential minor 
is 
geared 
towards 
students 
aspiring to careers in storytelling, 
documentary-making, 
podcasting and other forms 
of journalism. However, the 
interdisciplinary aspect of the 
proposed minor aims to attract 
students from other academic 
realms 
who 
are 
seeking 
a 
complementary minor to their 
major studies.
English 
professor 
Anne 
Curzan, 
associate 
dean 
for 
humanities in LSA, mentioned the 
importance of interdisciplinary 
studies within LSA, as well as the 

idea for a student-driven program 
pioneered by those interested 
in journalism and nonfiction 
writing.
“We know that a good number 
of students are interested in 
journalistic writing and creative 
nonfiction,” Curzan wrote in an 
email interview with The Daily. 
“In LSA, we can effectively 
ground this kind of writing in 
questions that are foundational to 
the liberal arts. Interdisciplinarity 
is one of the great strengths of 
LSA, and we always think about 
how best to coordinate proposed 
new minors across departments, 
when relevant.”
Courses 
such 
as 
English 
425, and English 345 highlight 
conventions of nonfiction writing 
and their intersection with media. 
These classes were designed to 
meet the student need for creative 
and journalistic course work, and 
are some of the efforts made in 
recent years to include diverse 
journalistic classes in the English 
department. English Lecturer 
Jeremiah Chamberlin recognized 
students’ desire to learn more 
about nonfiction writing, while 
also echoing Curzan’s emphasis 
on interdisciplinarity. 
“Many of us began to hear from 
more and more of our students 
who wanted to continue working 
in the genre, but who felt like they 
didn’t have many options … the 
course offerings for nonfiction 
were 
limited,” 
Chamberlin 
wrote in an email interview 
with The Daily. “As more and 

more of our nonfiction students 
go on to work in such fields as 
journalism, media or publishing, 
for example, the more they report 
back that they wish they’d had a 
more interdisciplinary approach 
to their education; the work 
they’re doing draws more across 
disciplines than they might have 
imagined.”
University alum Yoshiko Iwai, 
currently in graduate school at 
Columbia University, was a dual-
major in neuroscience and dance. 
Iwai, who worked for The Daily 
while at the University, utilized 
some courses in the English 
department, especially through 
Chamberlin, to further explore 
her interest in narrative medicine 
and creative nonfiction, which she 
currently studies as a graduate 
student.
Iwai echoed Chamberlin’s point 
regarding the limited amount of 
journalism and narrative-related 
courses available at the University. 
She explained that attaining some 
pitching and reporting skills to 
add to her repertoire while an 
undergraduate would have better 
prepared her for a post-graduate 
career in the field. A curriculum 
centered on the skills and lessons 
needed to succeed in journalism 
would allow students to explore 
their passion without being bound 
to a more general degree, Iwai 
said.

T

he deadly attacks on two 
New Zealand mosques 
that 
massacred 
more 
than 50 people is a gruesome 
reminder that far-right terrorism 
is a rising threat. In light of the 
havoc that shook the world to 
its core, we are now mourning 
innocent lives that have been lost, 
once again carried out by a white 
supremacist aiming to extinguish 
immigrants — whom they refer to 
as the “invaders of the West.”
Just five months ago, in 
October 2018, another depraved 
white supremacist in Pittsburgh 
fired hate-fueled bullets on 11 Jews 
at the Tree of Life synagogue. This 
extremist violence is becoming 
increasingly common and to let 
the perpetrators monopolize the 
discussion surrounding the vile 
level of carnage would be a huge 
mistake. It is urgent to analyze 
the source of such violence.
The gunman of the New 
Zealand terror attack left a 
74-page online manifesto, titled 
“The 
Great 
Replacement,” 
highlighting xenophobic fantasies 
that describe Muslim immigrants 
as the “most despised group 
of invaders in the West.” The 
shooter also said his inspiration 
was the Norwegian terrorist 
who killed 77 people in 2011 and 
shared the same vitriolic agenda: 
to eliminate Muslim immigrants. 
The extremists’ hateful screed 
encapsulates 
the 
growth 
of 
Islamophobia.
We 
must 
recognize 
that 
vilification 
of 
the 
Muslim 
community 
has 
been 
standardized for a long time by 
various politicians around the 
world. Australian Sen. Fraser 
Anning is proof that far-right 
extremism can be validated by 
those seated in parliament. At 
the aftermath of the tragedy, as 
Muslims lay dead in mosques, 
he released a public statement 
justifying the mass murder of 
Muslims and replicating the 
virulent ideology of the terrorist. 
He wrote: “the real cause of 
bloodshed 
on 
New 
Zealand 
streets today is the immigration 
program which allowed Muslim 
fanatics to migrate to New 
Zealand in the first place.” If we 
extend powerful positions to such 
racist individuals, it should come 
as no surprise when hatred spills 
among ordinary citizens.
But Anning is not the only 
one who has made blatantly 
racist comments. In October 
2018, President Donald Trump 
tweeted the phrase “unknown 
Middle Easterners” to instill 
fear regarding the “caravan” of 
immigrants from Central America 
crossing the southern border. In 
an interview in 2016, Trump said, 
“I think Islam hates us. … We can’t 
allow people coming into this 
country who have this hatred for 
the United States.” When will we 
admit that such attitudes toward 
Muslims, who currently comprise 
1.1 percent of the American 
population, empowers far-right 
groups and fosters Islamophobia?
And let’s not dismiss the 
complicity of the international 
media 
for 
disproportionately 
reporting Muslim terror attacks 
with fallacious headlines, like 
“Violent 
Islam 
terror 
attack 
strikes …” Labelling an entire 
religion 
as 
“violent” 
is 
an 
undoubtedly racist generalization 
and frankly deserves criticism for 
its gross lack of empiricism. How 
can one surmise Islam breeds 
violence without examining the 
religious texts? While Trump 
is quick to blame Muslims for 
terrorism, he is much more 
lethargic when Muslims are 

actually the victims of Islamic 
terrorism.
In a study published in 
Justice Quarterly, researchers at 
Georgia State University and the 
University of Alabama found that 
terror attacks by Muslims receive 
an average of 357 percent more 
media coverage than those by 
other groups. The team studied 
136 terrorist attacks in the U.S. 
between 2006 and 2015 using the 
Global Terrorism Database and 
concluded that 12.5 percent of 
these incidents were committed 
by Muslims, yet they received half 
of all news coverage.
After 
the 
New 
Zealand 
shooting, many journalists have 
been examining the terrorist’s 
manifesto and tracing the genesis 
of far-right terrorism back to 
the words and actions of right-
wing leaders. But right-wing 
supporters 
on 
YouTube 
and 
Twitter are rather offended and 
suggest the “fake media” always 
misconstrues horrific events to 
attack right-wing U.S. politics. 
Yet, “blame the hammer, not 
the hand” is a narrative that has 
been instilled by the right wing 
themselves ever since the attacks.

We’ve been reading that 
ideology 
matters, 
which 
emphasizes the need to study how 
non-violent 
Islam 
supposedly 
harvests radicalism and violence. 
Conservatives have promoted the 
discourse that violence does not 
exist in some sort of a vacuum 
while largely ignoring statistics 
from the FBI that hate crimes 
against 
American 
Muslims 
sharply increased after the Sept. 
11 attacks. While the media 
generally views jihadist attacks 
more newsworthy, it is worth 
noting that the Anti-Defamation 
League, an internation Jewish 
non-governmental group, finds 
that 
“domestic 
right-wing 
extremism” 
was 
responsible 
for 73.3 percent of extremist-
related killings in the U.S. from 
2009 to 2018 whereas “Islamist 
extremism” accounted for 23.4 
percent.
But 
conservatives 
such 
as 
the 
incomparable 
Ben 
Shapiro condemn the media 
for “rushing” to express that 
radical Islamic terrorism has 
no connection to actual Islam. 
In a 2017 article, Mr. Shapiro 
wrote: “Imagine that a white 
supremacist had driven a truck 
onto a bike path filled with 
minority 
innocents. 
Imagine 
that the white supremacist had 
emerged from his truck carrying 
aloft a Confederate flag. Imagine 
that the media had leapt to 
the defense of those flying the 
Confederate 
flag, 
explaining 
that only a tiny minority of those 
who did so had engaged in any 
sort of racist violence. … Hard to 
imagine, isn’t it?”
Well Mr. Shapiro, it was 
hard to imagine when the media 
failed to properly report the fact 
that “the FBI and the Homeland 
Security warned in a 2017 
intelligence bulletin that white 
supremacist groups had carried 
out more attacks in the U.S. than 
any other domestic extremist 

over the past 16 years.” So, 
logically speaking, why isn’t Ben 
Shapiro connecting the recent 
New Zealand attack to right-
wing theories as he did with 
Islamic terrorism? Where are 
his “intelligent” tweets insisting 
that “Facts don’t care about your 
feelings” now?
Similarly, 
in 
2014, 
Ben 
Shapiro released a video to 
conclude that terrorists find 
“moral, financial and religious 
support from those who are 
not 
terrorists 
themselves.” 
If we follow his logic, we 
could conclude that the war-
mongering far-right gains its 
ideological assistance from those 
in the right wing who aren’t 
terrorists themselves, including 
conservative commentators, like 
Ben Shapiro. So it’s time for the 
right to be consistent with their 
own sayings and counter the 
“roots” of the surge in far-right 
terrorism.
In February 2019, a Coast 
Guard 
lieutenant 
and 
self-
described white nationalist was 
arrested in Maryland for plotting 
to kill a long list of prominent 
journalists 
and 
Democratic 
politicians, in an effort to 
eliminate leftists in general. So 
it’s time for the right to start 
re-evaluating what they stand 
for and why their ideologies are 
increasingly warped to wage 
violence against minorities. The 
president especially needs to 
address this challenge instead 
of downplaying the scale of 
the threat as “a small group of 
people” with “very, very serious 
problems.” Every Muslim’s act of 
violence is immediately framed 
as “violent Islamic terrorism” but 
as white males continue to wage 
terror, we report the atrocities 
as “hate crimes” caused by their 
“mental disorders.” This fact is 
the biggest double standard of 
international politics. It’s time to 
change this racist way of dealing 
with massacres.
We must understand that 
terrorism 
is 
generated 
by 
extremism and deconstruct the 
deceptive public perception that 
terrorism is inherently Islamic. 
In reality, right-wing extremism 
follows the same model as 
Islamic extremism. They are two 
sides of the same coin: the ethno-
nationalist clash of civilizations 
between the West and the 
Muslim world. In my lived 
reality, the Muslim community 
where I was raised fears Islamic 
terrorism as much as they fear 
rising 
right-wing 
terrorism. 
In 
what 
I’ve 
personally 
witnessed in the three years I 
have lived in the U.S., there is 
barely any difference between 
how a Muslim American acts 
compared to how a white 
American acts.
People have to stop hating 
each other and treating each 
other 
as 
enemies. 
Rather, 
we must work together in 
countering extremist violence of 
all kinds. We have to eradicate 
fear-mongering 
narratives 
that only serve to pit groups 
against each other. In other 
words, politicians and pundits, 
especially those on the right 
wing, ought to stop propagating 
anti-Muslim rhetoric — before 
more innocent people lose their 
lives. Journalists have been 
pushing for policy shifts to 
counter domestic terrorism and 
so it’s crucial that we all sustain 
the momentum.

Friday,

ago 
today, 
I 
participated 
in 
the 
Washtenaw County Climate Strike, 
one of more than 2,000 global 
climate strikes across more than 
125 countries with an estimated 1.4 
million people.
It was a day that touched every 
part of the emotional spectrum 
— 
eliciting 
hope, 
frustration, 
inspiration, anxiety, compassion and 
fear.
It was a day that started with 
more than 2,500 high schoolers, 
college students and community 
members walking out of their 
classes and obligations to demand 
real climate action for a livable 
future. These demonstrators stood 
in the rain and the cold, clinging to 
every word of nationally-known 
politicians like Abdul El-Sayed to 
12-year-old students from a local 
middle school.
The passion of the speakers was 
met unbroken and undimmed, even 
as the rain started. Demonstrators 
held umbrellas right along with 
signs reading, “My future is not 
for sale, why go to class when the 
world is burning?” and “Carbon 
neutrality by 2030.”
It was a day that brought the 
streets of downtown Ann Arbor 
to a halt as hundreds marched 
through them.
It was a day that packed the 
University of Michigan’s Fleming 
Administration 
Building 
with 
protesters 
demanding 
climate 
action and transparency.
And it was a day that ended 
with the arrests of 10 individuals, 
including two high school students, 
who sat peacefully in University 
President Mark Schlissel’s office, 
asking only for a public and 
unfiltered meeting between the 
president and his community.
Walking home at 10 p.m. after 
the walk-out, rally, march and sit-in, 
I realized that above all, it was a day 
of stark juxtaposition between the 
undeterred passion of everyone 
involved in the day-long event and 
the refusal of the administration 
to grant the simplest of requests. 
It was a split between the peaceful 
protests of brave individuals and 
the escalation to arrests by the 
administration. It was divided 
between the fury of the generation 
who will live their lives in a world 
forever altered by climate change 

and the disrespect and disinterest 
of the generation in power.
At 1:30 p.m., the sit-in began 
with the reading of our demands, 
which we had reduced to a single 
phrase: “a just transition to true 
carbon neutrality by 2030.” The 
request was ignored — Schlissel 
was “out of town,” something 
that I found out is not uncommon 
when his students are demanding 
change.
At 4 p.m., we presented 
our 
immediate 
ask 
to 
the 
administration: 
an 
agreement 
to schedule a public, one hour, 
unfiltered, 
student-moderated, 
open-to-the-press 
meeting 
between 
the 
community 
and 
Schlissel. We agreed to leave if we 
got it.
I thought we would be out by 
4:15 p.m., but the administration 
refused to commit to a meeting. 
They even refused to tell us 
whether or not Schlissel had been 
spoken to.
At 5 p.m., the building closed 
and we were threatened with 
arrest if we stayed.
At 7:45 p.m., after over six 
hours of peacefully sitting-in, a 
University police sergeant came in 
and threatened arrest to whoever 
remained inside the building at 8 
p.m.
As about 50 young people filed 
out of the office, a contingent of 10 
remained, standing silently.
At 8 p.m., the police arrested 
them, one by one, including two 
high school aged minors, whom 
the police detained and illegally 
questioned until their parents 
arrived.
Not willing to risk arrest, I 
walked down the stairs of the 
Administration 
Building 
and 
outside into the cold Friday night. 
I felt incredibly defeated.
If the University of Michigan 
— one of the top, most forward 
thinking and leading research 
universities in the world — cannot 
agree to a one-hour, transparent 
meeting to openly discuss its 
current climate policies, how will 
we ever fix our current climate 
crisis?
If the University of Michigan 
escalates to arrest when its 
students voice their opinion, how 
can we inspire action?
My sense of defeat began to 
recede, however, as I saw those 

who chose not to get arrested 
standing in the cold Friday night 
air and cheering in support until 
every individual was released. 
The longer I watched this group 
of strangers waiting in solidarity 
outside 
the 
Administration 
Building with undimmed and 
infinite optimism and compassion, 
the more my sense of defeat yielded 
to stronger feelings of hope, vigor 
and renewed energy.
It 
was 
inspiring 
being 
surrounded by those willing to risk 
the repercussions of walking out of 
class and work, by those willing 
to give up their day and night to 
sit in the president’s office for six 
and a half hours and by those were 
willing to put their bodies, their 
safety and their futures on the line 
to demonstrate their frustration 
with the utter inadequacy of the 
University’s climate action.
It was inspiring to join a long 
history of sit-ins and direct action, 
particularly by indigenous people 
and people of color.
If you feel defeated, inspired, 
invigorated or scared, please reach 
out to me and see how you can get 
involved. We need everyone.
We are the generation that will 
live with the detrimental effects 
of climate change. We are the 
generation that will have to tell our 
kids what coral reefs used to look 
like and explain that many of the 
animals seen in children’s books 
have disappeared. We will be the 
generation who will see the already-
existing 
systems 
of 
inequality 
exacerbated by climate change. 
We are the generation that will see 
the cities we’ve grown up in slowly 
washed away by the rising seas.
We are also the generation that 
will not sit quietly and wait until 
this future becomes the present. 
We will fight with the compassion, 
the perseverance, the solidarity, 
the love and the desire that carried 
us through this entire day. We will 
continue to sit in the president’s 
office until we ensure that the 
University does its part in creating a 
clean and just future for all. Join us.

Keeping up with politics

H

ow many of you can 
name the winner of this 
year’s “The Bachelor”? 
How many of you are aware who 
the 
next 
“Bachelorette” 
will 
be? Who can give an in-depth 
analysis of the Jordyn Woods 
and Tristan Thompson cheating 
scandal that has yet again thrust 
the Kardashians and their endless 
drama to the top of our social media 
timelines? I know all of my friends 
can answer these three questions, 
as well as many questions related to 
pop culture and the entertainment 
industry. Yet while the world 
obsesses over whether Bradley 
Cooper and Lady Gaga are falling 
in love, we are seemingly asleep 
at the wheel when it comes to the 
major political issues of the day.
How many of you know who 
has announced their candidacies 
for a presidential run in 2020? 
How many of you can name both 
of your state’s senators or the 
elected representative from your 
district? While many college-aged 
youths are plugged into the latest 
political scandals or tragedies via 
the news on smartphones and via 
social media, it seems that other 
important aspects of politics are 
slipping through the cracks. While 
college may be a time when some 
become more politically active, it 
is also a time of infinite busyness 
and distraction. Between the hours 
of studying, extracurriculars and 
attempting to make time for a social 
life, it often seems understandable 
to not want to fill one’s few free 
hours a week with the latest report 
on the more mundane aspects 
of politics. But what if much like 
showering, eating or sleeping, 
keeping up to date on politics was 
viewed as an integral part of one’s 
weekly routine?
Apathy is a dangerous thing. 
Even those of us who do not 
find enjoyment or interest in the 
political realm have a responsibility 
to remain aware and civically 
active. This isn’t a new sentiment 
either. Most have probably heard 
it at one time or another, yet it still 
seems to fall on deaf ears. However, 

in a world of big government and 
globalization, almost every aspect 
of our lives is touched by politics 
whether we like it or not.
For example, the access of our 
search histories and social media 
profiles that corporations and the 
government have is something that 
affects nearly every single one of 
us. It is something that, if asked, 
I’m sure most would have some 
opinion on — but how many of us 
remain aware of the government 
regulations 
surrounding 
this 
issue? Mark Zuckerberg’s hearing 
may have been meme-worthy on 
Twitter, but I do not know many 
people who actually watched it in 
its entirety.
Or what about government 
regulations 
surrounding 
trade, 
tariffs and subsidies? While the 
mere mention of these words may 
make some want to fall asleep, these 
issues affect the price of almost 
every good available to us daily. 
From the prices of our produce 
to the price of gas, the way our 
government handles international 
trade affects us intimately.
There are so many issues 
affecting our nation’s people as 
well as the rest of the world every 
day that most think little about 
and may have never even heard 
of. Here are just a few examples. 
There are currently about 437,500 
children in foster care in the U.S., 
living their lives within a broken 
system that shifts them from home 
to home with minimal protection 
from mistreatment and abuse. On 
average, 130 Americans die every 
day from opioid overdoses, and 
the number of yearly opioid deaths 
was six times higher in 2017 than 
in 1999. The largest agricultural 
corporation in the U.S., Monsanto 
(which was recently bought out 
by Bayer, providing a timely name 
change in light of negative press), 
was responsible for the creation 
of Agent Orange, many genetically 
modified seed strains, as well as 
the common herbicide Roundup. 
Monsanto was recently sued on 
a claim that Roundup may have 
active chemicals that can be linked 

to cancer.
There are endless examples 
such as these, some with higher 
stakes than others, yet it seems 
that only the most clickbait-
worthy, 
scandalous 
or 
tragic 
political stories garner any sort 
of mainstream media buzz and 
catch the eye of the general public. 
If I were to ask my friends if they 
want our country and world to be 
a better place and if they think we 
have room to improve, they would 
undoubtedly all say yes. Yet how 
are we supposed to improve our 
world when we are more obsessed 
with 
immediate 
entertainment 
value than issues that truly impact 
us on a daily basis? It is not enough 
to simply say one will plug into 
politics when they are older. We 
will never again have more time 
on our hands to enact substantive 
change as activists, intellectuals 
and young people full of the sort 
of hope and vigor for life that 
fades over time. Now is the time 
in our lives when we can dedicate 
ourselves to enacting change. We 
don’t have mortgages, careers or 
families yet. We may have classes 
and social lives but these are small 
fish compared to all that will take 
up our time in the near future.
The task may seem daunting, but 
it is really as simple as closing out of 
the latest article about Kylie Jenner 
and opening up a tab to one of this 
nation’s many news outlets, most of 
which provide at least some level 
of free access. Even 15 minutes a 
day of research on a new issue that 
is affecting our state, country or 
world may open your eyes to an 
issue that profoundly impacts the 
way you view the world or inspires 
you to try and enact change. We 
will not create a better future for 
our children by “Keeping Up with 
the Kardashians.” We will create a 
better future for them by keeping 
up with the world of politics and 
current events in a proactive and 
responsible fashion.

“All things keep getting better,” goes the “Queer 
Eye” theme song, a pulsing, techno-dance anthem 
that always manages to get the dopamine factories 
churning. This is a show about striving toward self-
improvement and recognizing betterment not as a 
stopping point, but 
as a way forward. 
And 
against 
the 
backdrop 
of 
a 
world 
decidedly 
not getting better, 
there’s something 
about that conceit 
that makes it the 
most 
uplifting 
thing on television.
The 
third 
season of “Queer 
Eye,” 
Netflix’s 
rebooted 
version 
of 
the 
2000s 
Bravo reality hit 
“Queer Eye for the 
Straight Guy,” was 
released 
quickly 
after the second, 
which 
aired 
in 
June. 
The 
Fab 
Five — the diverse, gregarious team of lifestyle 
experts unleashed upon average Joes — are back, 
and it’s almost like they never left. (Almost being 
the operative word here: There are the requisite 
number of French tucks, but *gasp!* not a single 
avocado to be found.)
What makes “Queer Eye” so fun to watch is 
that it’s a perfect combination of all the best, most 
cathartic pop culture tropes: part talk-therapy and 
part movie-makeover scene with a little HGTV 
sprinkled in. Each episode follows the Fab Five — 
Antoni, Tan, Karamo, Bobby and Jonathan — as 
they tackle new “projects,” well-meaning people 
whose friends and family members have nominated 
them for life overhauls.
By the end, not only do the clients look better 
and dress better, but they also communicate more 
effectively and sincerely. The Netflix version has 
shuffled off the “for the Straight Guy” suffix, 

allowing the Fab Five to be equal-opportunity 
transformers. And in fact, the most affecting 
episodes this season center around women — “Jones 
BBQ,” about the owners of a Kansas City takeout 
spot, and “Black Girl Magic,” about Jess, a gay Black 
woman disowned by her adoptive parents.
The show reaches graceful, emotional heights 
when the Fab Five let on that they didn’t spring from 
the earth fully self-assured, that they have their own 
vulnerabilities and 
traumas to grapple 
with too. Bobby, 
who often alludes 
to his difficulties 
growing 
up 
gay 
in an evangelical 
Missouri 
household, 
is 
remarkably 
well-
positioned 
to 
comfort 
Jess. 
Jonathan, running 
a comb through the 
hair of a recently 
widowed 
single 
father, recalls the 
depressive episode 
he 
endured 
following 
his 
mother’s 
cancer 
diagnosis.
In 
previous 
seasons, the show struggled to reconcile its feel-
good energies with its risky ambitions to heal 
divides and bring people together. That often 
resulted in tone-deaf moments: Karamo’s clash 
with the Trump-supporting cop made over in the 
first season is a little too neatly resolved. Bobby’s 
discomfort with the church last season — borne 
of his childhood trauma — is chalked up to a mere 
cultural difference. They seem to have abandoned 
that clumsiness this season. But it is frustrating 
that the show has continued to ignore the elephant 
in the room: The time and means required to have 
a tailored wardrobe and a grooming routine are out 
of reach for a lot of people. 
To its credit, though, “Queer Eye” is already 
operating under a premise fraught with racial and 
class politics of its own. The idea that everyone is 
deserving of love and self-care and acceptance — 
what’s more radical than that?

‘Queer Eye’ just gets better

MAITREYI ANANTHARAMAN

The 
headlines 
about 
21 
Savage’s 
arrest 
and 
deportation proceedings last 
month seemed straight out of 
an Onion article. The whole 
thing has been surreal for 
fans: One of Atlanta’s poster-
boy rappers, alongside artists 
like 
Gucci 
Mane, 
Future, 
Young Thug and 2 Chainz … 
was born in London?
On the morning of Feb. 3, 
rapper 21 Savage 
was 
arrested 
and 
detained 
by 
Immigration 
and 
Customs 
Enforcement. 
ICE 
released 
a 
statement 
that 
day 
saying 
21 
Savage, 
real 
name She’yaa Bin 
Abraham-Joseph, 
is an “unlawfully 
present 
United 
Kingdom 
national” 
who 
came to the U.S. 
in 
2005 
and 
overstayed 
his 
visa that expired a 
year later. A CNN 
reporter 
quoted 
an ICE spokesman 
who claimed “His 
whole 
public 
persona is false. 
He actually came 
to the U.S. from 
the U.K. as a teen 
and overstayed his 
visa.”
The 
most 
bizarre 
part? 
According to ICE, 
21 Savage first came in 2005 
— when he was already twelve 
years old. That’s too old to 
get rid of an accent, right? 
(I happen to know someone 
personally who also came to 
the U.S. from London at twelve 
and can testify to his thick 
British 
accent.) 
Combined 
with zero public knowledge of 
21 Savage’s birthplace, it reeks 
of an intentional coverup. A 
plot twist, if you will.
In the next few days, his 
lawyers 
followed 
up 
with 
a statement that countered 
ICE’s accusations. According 
to his legal team, 21 Savage 
came to the United States at 
seven years old (which would 

much 
better 
explain 
him 
losing his accent), went to the 
UK for one month in 2005, 
then returned on a visa that 
expired in 2006, leaving him 
without citizenship. They also 
alleged that his immigration 
status was not hidden from 
officials as he applied for a 
special type of visa in 2017 
granted 
to 
crime 
victims 
and could help with ongoing 
investigations.
Like a coping mechanism 
to deal with the unexpected, 
the 
hip-hop 
community 

began chugging out memes 
the moment Twitter got word 
of his arrest. In an interview 
with The New York Times, 21 
Savage said of the memes: “I 
been shot — what is a meme? 
A meme is nothing … I look at 
bullet scars every day, so it’s 
like, a meme, bro?” Something 
I 
unironically 
find 
highly 
eloquent.
21 Savage was granted an 
expedited hearing on Feb. 
12 and released on $100,000 
bond the next day. The 21 
Savage saga is still ongoing — 
an immigration court hearing 
is set for April 11, and it 
looks like it might come to an 
uneventful close. He has since 

opened up to many media 
outlets 
about 
his 
ten-day 
detainment and experience 
growing 
up 
without 
legal 
status. But there’s one thing 
that’s stayed on my mind after 
the whole ordeal.
21 Savage went lyrically 
conscious about immigration 
politics prior to his arrest. 
Most 
notably, 
during 
his 
performance of “A Lot” at the 
“Tonight Show ” days before 
his arrest, he added new 
lyrics: “I can’t imagine my kids 
stuck at the border / Flint still 
need water / 
People 
was 
innocent, 
couldn’t 
get 
lawyers.”
It’s not like 
21 
Savage 
has 
been 
dropping 
conscious 
lyrics 
for 
years. 
Even 
just a couple 
years ago on 
Issa 
Album, 
his raps were 
chiefly about 
trap music’s 
lyrical 
holy 
trinity: 
sex, 
drugs 
and 
money. 
So 
when he was 
arrested 
days 
after 
he criticized 
ICE 
for 
their 
(mis)
handling 
of 
children 
at the U.S./
Mexican 
border 
on 
national 
television, an alarm should’ve 
gone off in everybody’s head.
By all measures aside from 
citizenship, 21 Savage is an 
American. That much is clear. 
He may have a felony drug 
charge under his belt, but that 
was expunged and sealed, and 
he’s been a positive influence 
on his community since then. 
So why would ICE suddenly 
pursue him, when the Trump 
administration’s 
priorities 
are 
on 
criminal 
illegal 
immigrants?
It’s funny and surprising 
to learn that he’s from the 
UK. But there is more to 21 
Savage’s arrest than meets the 
eye.

BOOK REVIEW

MUSIC NOTEBOOK

Queer Eye

Season Three

Netflix

The 15 stories in Maryse Meijer’s second collection, “Rag,” 
frequently begin with chance encounters — a high school-aged 
boy working at a pizza parlor has a strange series of interactions 
with a girl who has a miscarriage in the bathroom, a man 
befriends a woman he meets during jury duty for a murder case 
and becomes fascinated with the scars on her arms, a lifeguard 
saves a boy from drowning and feels an attachment to him 
indistinguishable from the visceral memory of the incident.
The plots of these stories stay in this space of plausible chance 
encounter for as long as they possibly can, teetering in the space 
right before decisive, concrete action. In the meantime, Meijer 
recounts the often subliminal reactions her main characters 
have on what’s unfolding in front of them, as they reckon with 
what they want out of the situation and what’s possible for them.
Meijer has written that “while I consume — and seek out — 
quite a lot of explicitly violent and sexual work, I don’t write 
it.” This statement might seem odd in relation to a collection 

where sexuality and violence proliferate fungally in nearly every 
story, but in truth, very little actual violence and sex happens 
in Meijer’s stories. She is instead interested in exploring the 
psychological tendencies that lead up to violence, suspending 
her stories in a space just adjacent of horror. Her stories tend 
to end right at the point where something is about to happen, 
leaving any conflicts unresolved, the plot abandoned at its point 
of maximum tension.
In the process, Meijer fuses sex and violence into an almost 
singular entity, and uses attraction and repulsion as a pair of 
emotions that fuel each other. In her story “The Brother,” a 
teenage boy at once desperately wants to be his stepbrother and 
feels a seething, jealous hatred for him. Other stories often track 
the progression of a dreadful longing right up to the point of 
unspeakable action. “Francis” sketches an uneasy juxtaposition 
between a protagonist’s job euthanizing dogs and his taking care 
of his deaf brother: “The needles rattle in my bag. One full dose 
and they’re done. No convulsions. No knowledge. Just the eyes 
turning to glass. My brother is asleep on the couch, the blanket 
half slipped from his hip.” It’s a situation full of the tense 
potential for violence, but that’s all it ever is. The story ends 
without anything definite happening, and we get the impression 
that things could just as easily slip into violence as they could 
dim back into nothing.
Part of what makes these stories so effective is Meijer’s 
striking prose style. She alternates long, tumbling sentences 
with short, clipped ones, like someone desperately trying to 
avoid thinking about what they’re recounting. It resembles 
a kind of oral storytelling in its simplicity, albeit maybe one 
performed under interrogation lights. The opener, “Her Blood,” 
is particularly terse, the language an integral part of the story’s 
sense of mounting dread: 
“There’d been a trail of blood from the bathroom to the counter 
to the booth to the door, blood on the medics’ blue suits as they 
carried her out. I imagined having what she had, a place in my body 
that could splash an entire room with my insides and then let me 
walk away. I got an erection though I didn’t mean to. I pushed my 
hands into the front pocket of my hoodie and rubbed them against 
my crotch, grimacing, not feeling good at all.”
Her clipped and to-the-point sentences are bolstered by her 
breathtakingly precise word choice. The word “splash” in the 
passage above is a fulcrum around which the rest of it revolves; 
the word “blue” emits a garish, clinical color against the goriness 
of its content.
Meijer’s virtuosic use of language can work against her at 

times, especially when her stories are less than compelling in 
premise or plot. When she abandons the dread that fuels the best 
stories of the collection, I was left with the sense that nothing 
is really being communicated. The rather tedious story “The 
Lover,” which tracks the progression of a relationship between 
a young orphan girl and a pedophile, is a good example of this.
Meijer’s style is one that reads like it’s designed to disguise 
hidden depths, and in a story like “The Lover” in which 
the awfulness is on the surface, it comes across as a kind of 
melodrama. “It was important to the Dane that no one see her 
come into his house, so she came only at night, through the 
back door, with a key he’d given her, worn always around her 
neck. After he fell asleep she would go out into the garden to 
pull weeds or pick snails off the vegetable beds, his garden more 
beautiful than any place she had ever been, even in the dark.” 
The hyperbole of the story is certainly justified given its subject 
matter, but it sticks out in comparison to how meticulously 
restrained Meijer is elsewhere in the collection. “The Lover” is 
also one of the only stories in the collection where the lines of 
desire Meijer cultivates intersect in a meaningful way, and thus 
it feels like a wholly different animal than the more open-ended, 
bristling stories that make this collection a definite standout.

Raise the ruff!
It’s Friday!!!

I would be one of many 
classic rock fans to be elated 
in 
the 
wake 
of 
another 
Woodstock. The age in which 
it fell is a period of time I’ve 
always been obsessed with, in 
a way that has greatly colored 
my understanding of modern 
pop 
culture. 
Everything 
I 
listen 
to 
or 
watch 
is 
immediately compared to the 
media of the ’60s and ’70s, 
the media that I was raised 
on and developed my own 
love for as I grew up. I am the 
poster child for that languid 
teenager 
self-proclaimed 
to be “born in the wrong 
decade.” Yet despite that love 
for the Aquarian age, 2019’s 
upcoming 50th anniversary 
celebration of the first, most 
famous Woodstock festival 
stings more than expected. It 
makes me wonder if we will 
ever have something truly 
like Woodstock ’69 again.
Let’s first understand the 
context in which the original 
Woodstock came to fruition: 
a small festival was planned 
to be held in upstate New 
York in the blazing heat 
of August. They expected 
50,000 people — 400,000 
came. From those conditions 
and the social revolution 
of America’s hippie golden 
years, Woodstock ’69 became 
a lasting memory in the 
consciousness of music lovers 
and pop culture aficionados 
alike. People (literally) broke 
down barriers to enter. It was 
a magical, if not chaotic,three 
days in a time full of creation 
and destruction set against 
the war in Vietnam. 
You get the jist: the 
festival 
would 
be 
hard to replicate in 
any era, even its own. 
Everyone knows the 
name Woodstock.
In this recognition 
and 
respect 
for 
the original shows 
my 
problem 
with 
Woodstock’s 
50th. 

Although 2019 is a year of 
similar revolution, for rights 
and positive change in the 
entertainment 
industries, 
it is disheartening to know 
that we are fighting for 
the same things now that 
we did then. The Gloria 
Steinems and Marvin Gayes 
of yesterday’s pop cultural 
landscape are reflected in 
figures we know and love 
today. In that way, this year 
would be a perfect time for a 
remembrance of Woodstock, 
to think about the things we 
have done and still have yet 
to accomplish for rights and 
the progression of artistic 
freedom. I acknowledge this, 
and understand its influence 
on the decision to have a 
memorial festival in the first 
place. No, my issue is not 
with that aspect of the 50th 
it is with the music.
The final lineup released 
this week was, to say the 
least, disappointing. It is 
not all bad, and serves as 
an eclectic mix of today’s 
artists, old and young. With 
Imagine Dragons headlining 

the third day, the focus 
on the mainstream acts of 
music today waters down 
the spectacular returns of 
performers 
like 
Santana, 
who memorably played at the 
original festival, and those 
who never got a chance to in 
1969, like Dead & Company, 
Grateful 
Dead’s 
modern 
iteration 
including 
John 
Mayer. Maggie Rogers is 
great, sure, so is Greta Van 
Fleet. But these acts fail to 
capture 
the 
unmatchable 
feeling 
conjured 
by 
the 
original Woodstock.
And herein lies the crux 
of the situation: the majority 
of today’s music does not 
have the raw, revolutionary 
quality 
of 
many 
of 
the 
acts included in the initial 
festival. Maybe it is the time 
we live in, maybe it is the 
fact that fame and success 
are 
very 
different 
beasts 
than they used to be. Maybe 
it is because the acts that 
are pushing the envelope 
on 
musical 
innovation 
are equaled in the lineup 
by ones that are just OK. 
Nonetheless, regardless of 
the music’s quality in general, 
I genuinely don’t believe any 
other time could capture the 
magic of Woodstock better 
than 1969 could. The 25th 
anniversary festival in 1994 
didn’t, so why do people 
believe that 2019 can? Part of 
why the original Woodstock 
remains in our memory today 
is its accidental nature no 
one expected those three 
days to become as much of a 
cultural touchstone 
as they are. It was 
a wild world then, 
and it is now. But I 
don’t know whether 
that’s 
worth 

replicating the same 
serendipitous genius 
that 
produced 
Woodstock. 
And 
I believe that it is 
foolish to even try.

Beef with Woodstock 50

On 
Tuesday 
I 
was 
fortunate to attend the world 
premiere 
of 
“Inhuman,” 
a 
short 
film 
by 
Haley 
Tibbenham, a junior in the 
School of Music, Theatre & 
Dance. Ten other members 
of the cast and crew were 
present at the premiere, 
including 
director 
of 
photography 
Joshua 
Knoller 
(his “Talk to Me” 
was an Official 
Selection at the 
Cannes 
Film 
Festival in 2016). 
“Inhuman” 
is 
“not 
your 
average 
high 
school 
Rom-
Com,” according 
to 
the 
film’s 
Facebook 
page. 
For a no-spoilers 
plot 
rundown: 
The film follows 
Alice, 
her 
“friends” 
who 
think she should 
be thinner and 
Elliot, the nice guy with 
a romantic interest in our 
teenage lead. Alice isn’t 
too keen on Elliot, for a 
reason which will be made 
clear in the final scene. (A 
hint to keep you engaged: 
pay attention to the books 
mentioned 
during 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
film.) 
Partially shot in Holland, 
Michigan, the beach scenes 
are beautiful — the film 
makes use of a relatively cool 
color 
palette 
throughout, 
with 
a 
few 
intentional 
bursts 
of 
crimson. 
The 
iconic Holland lighthouse 
is one of these cochineal 
punctuations. The framing 
of 
this 
particular 
scene 

echoes Wes Anderson, in 
the best possible way.
By the time the credits 
roll, you get a sense that 
this is a film complete in 
its entirety. By this, I mean 
to say it reaches its full 
potential only by the end of 
its final scene. Independent 
of the exciting plot-twisting 
at the end, the film has 
a 
certain 
superficiality. 

Initially, the subject matter 
and dialogue lack depth, 
and ask little of the viewer. 
I 
enjoy 
being 
absorbed 
and interrogated by a film. 
Inhuman doesn’t interrogate 
or 
challenge, 
until 
the 
last moment. That being 
said, watching the credits 
appear brought a smirk to 
my face. The foreshadowing 
and 
cinematographic 
hints 
began 
to 
make 
sense. 
What 
appeared 
initially superficial became 
multidimensional.
In a short Q&A after 
the premiere, Tibbenham 
(director, writer and star) 
said she wanted her film to 
be viewed not as an identity 

piece. She believes labelling 
a work of art an “identity 
piece” can be patronizing, 
and 
only 
applies 
to 
underrepresented 
groups. 
This is part-rom-com, part-
fantasy. Tibbenham wanted 
to make a film in which 
someone “different” could 
be the star, someone outside 
the visually homogeneous 
battery of A-list actors and 
actresses. For 
a 
film 
that 
deals 
with 
self-image 
and 
self-
confidence, it 
takes a novel 
approach and 
encourages 
the viewer to 
question 
all 
sides of the 
debate. 
Not 
only 
should 
we not force 
ourselves and 
our friends to 
fit a certain 
mold, but we 
should 
also 
not 
expect 
those 
who 
don’t 
fit 
to feel a certain way. To 
broaden 
the 
argument, 
being 
an 
ally 
means 
different things in different 
situations. “Inhuman,” in 
the most fantastical way, 
reminds the viewer that you 
may not always know what 
someone is going through. 
Calling the film an identity 
piece is an “injustice to how 
interesting 
this 
content 
is,” Tibbenham said. That 
content, 
about 
what 
it 
means to be a woman today, 
under pressure for society 
and peers, is important. 
“Inhuman” puts a novel spin 
on commonly used themes, 
a refreshing take on genres 
which can often feel limp.

‘Inhuman’ is 15 minutes
topped with satisfaction

FILM REVIEW

ROSS ORGIEFSKY
Daily Arts Writer

Here’s how I know that the 
word “feminism” is stigmatized. 
Until 
recently, 
I’ve 
said 
the 
words 
“I’m 
a 
feminist” 
self-
consciously. I’ve 
gotten 
some 
uncomfortable 
laughter, 
quick 
looks downward 
and blank stares. 
Encouraging 
smiles 
have 
been 
few 
and 
far 
between, 
especially when 
talking to people 
of the opposite 
sex. So, why the 
stigma?
As a 20-year 
old 
female 
of 
color, I’ve come 
to 
realize 
that 
a 
lot 
of 
the 
problem 
stems 
from 
feminists 
being 
labeled 
as 
“aggressive.” 
This 
isn’t 
unique to those 
courageous 
enough 
to 
openly 
fight 
for 
feminism; 
numerous studies 
have shown that 
women who are 
seen as forceful are also seen 
as less competent. People take 
women less seriously if they 
seem angry or frustrated about 
an issue, and many label them 
as the infamous “sensitive.” 
There’s nothing worse than 
letting 
your 
passion 
for 
something show only to be told 
to “calm down.”
Not 
surprisingly, 
no 
one 
knew this better than Frida 
Kahlo. And no one defied the 
notion that women should fit 
a carefully-constructed mold 
more than she did.
I remember seeing one of 
Kahlo’s self-portraits as a child 
and thinking: How did she 
have the courage to look like 
that? Her eyebrows seemed to 
inch closer to each other with 

every passing second and her 
moustache was accentuated by 
the bright light shining from 
the museum display. Her eyes 
stared back at me defiantly, 

daring me to ask the question 
on my lips. “Yes, this is me,” she 
seemed to say. “Deal with it.”
Kahlo was unapologetically 
herself; this is easy to see in 
any of her self-portraits. At the 
time, she was in stark contrast 
to myself — a sophomore in 
high-school 
growing 
into 
accepting 
myself, 
but 
still 
largely self-conscious of my 
body and appearance. Kahlo 
had 
reached 
this 
level 
of 
understanding already, and left 
her public image up for scrutiny 
in the late 1930s, a time when 
women 
were 
treated 
much 
differently then they are today. 
You have to admire her level of 
consistently not giving a damn.
Take, for example, Kahlo’s 
“The Suicide of Dorothy Hale.” 

Originally 
commissioned 
to 
commemorate the life of a 
young minor actress, Kahlo 
instead 
painted 
the 
scene 
depicting Hale’s actual suicide. 
Hale’s 
body 
lies 
beautifully 
on 
the 
ground, 
immaculately 
dressed in a black 
evening dress but 
surrounded 
by 
blood. The white 
towering building 
looms over her, 
but 
it’s 
clear 
where the focus 
of 
the 
painting 
lies. Kahlo chose 
to 
bring 
her 
audiences 
face-
to-face 
with 
suicide instead of 
celebrating a life. 
Why? Because she 
could. 
And 
she 
did.
Most of Kahlo’s 
works are filled 
with 
intimate 
symbolism, 
and 
nothing 
sings 
symbolism 
than 
“My 
Birth,” 
in 
which 
Kahlo 
imagines 
the 
birth of herself. 
The 
graphic 
painting hints at 
Kahlo’s struggles 
with 
infertility 
after 
a 
near-
fatal bus crash at 18 years old. 
Infertility is stigmatized even 
today, but Kahlo had no issues 
letting the public know about 
her problems. Nothing was 
too gruesome to be painted in 
Kahlo’s mind.
Kahlo 
was 
revolutionary 
beyond her times, but she taught 
me very little about myself five 
years ago. Now, I’ve come to 
realize how extraordinary a 
feminist she was. Today, she 
teaches me that it’s OK to be 
weird and different if it’s you. 
Kahlo’s bold spirit may have 
been seen as “forward,” her 
appearance may have been seen 
as untidy, but she was utterly 
content with being herself. 
That’s a lesson I believe all of 
us can learn from.

What Frida Kahlo taught
me about myself over time

COMMUNITY CULTURE NOTEBOOK

At the time, she was in stark 
contrast to myself — a sophomore 
in high-school growing into 
accepting myself, but still largely 
self-conscious of my body and 
appearance.

A Perfect 10: Natalie Wojcik and the joy of gymnastics

In observance of Women’s 
History Month, The Daily’s sports 
section is launching its second 
annual series aimed at telling the 
stories of female athletes, coaches 
and teams at the University from 
the perspective of the female 
sports 
writers 
on 
staff. 
We 
continue the series with this story 
from Shira Zisholtz.
It was 2002. A young, blonde, 
wide-eyed three-year-old girl 
sat in front of the TV watching 
professional athletes in sparkly 
leotards defy gravity as they 
threw themselves into the air, 
flipped, 
twisted 
and 
landed 
perfectly on two feet. The girl, 
ambitious and intrigued, figured, 
“Why shouldn’t I try that?” She 
took a cushion off her sofa, took 
a breath and threw herself into a 
back handspring. 
She landed on her head, 
assured her mom she was OK, 
and shortly thereafter, her mom 
enrolled 
her 
in 
gymnastics 
classes.
And, as they say, the rest is 
history. 
Fast forward to Feb. 23, 
2019. The Michigan women’s 
gymnastics team is competing 
at the Big Five Meet to claim 
the regular-season title. That 
young, blonde, wide-eyed girl is 
standing in front of thousands, 
donning her own sparkly leotard 
of maize and blue. She mentally 
reviewed 
her 
routine 
“key 
words,” took a breath and took 
off. 
She ran, propelled herself onto 
the vault, pushed off to complete 
a Yurchenko 1 ½ — and stuck the 
landing. 
The crowd went crazy. Her 
team ran to her with tears of joy. 
The last time the Wolverines 
performed to this caliber on 
vault was in 2011.
The score flashed. 
10.000.

Natalie Wojcik, the freshman 
phenomenon, had her first career 
perfect 10. 
Wojcik has had an incredible 
career at Michigan thus far, with 
31 career event and all-around 
victories, earned Freshman of 
the Week honors five times and 
Gymnast of the Week eight. 
When she was being recruited, 
she visited only one school – the 
University of Michigan – fell in 
love and never looked back. And 
it’s safe to say the Wolverines 
haven’t looked back, either.
“Natalie is really the whole 
package,” said Michigan coach 
Bev Plocki. “People always ask 
you the question, ‘Have they 
lived up to your expectations? 
Or, did you expect her to be this 
good? And my sense when I get 
asked that question is that it’s 
kind of a loaded question … but 
this is a case, with her, where we 
expected her to be outstanding, 
and she even exceeded the 
outstanding expectations that 
we had for her.”
Wojcik 
has 
proven 
her 
excellence in her individual 
performances. 
But 
to 
her, 
competing as a Wolverine means 
so much more – it means being 
part of a team. 
“The team honestly gives me 
so much energy and just helps 
me feel confident knowing that 
I have them behind me,” she 
explains. “When it’s a tough day 
they cheer you on and when it’s a 
good day they cheer you on, too. 
So just being able to have each 
other’s backs and being there for 
each other day in and day out has 
been really special.” 
Despite her stellar record, 
it isn’t always perfect 10s for 
Natalie. She falls in practices, she 
won’t stick her landings at meets, 
she’ll hyperextend her knees 
after a challenging floor pass. 
She will spend hours in practice 
trying to perfect a new routine, 
a new skill, and will push herself 
until she gets it right.
And yet, with all of the 

frustration, challenges and push 
to perfection, Wojcik still wants 
to do what she does.
In doing so, she follows sound 
advice that she would give to 
others.
“You have to do it for the pure 
joy of the sport, not just what you 
are trying to get out of it,” Wojcik 
said. “You have to enjoy every 
single day and be able to pour 
your passion into it. And if you’re 
focused on attaining one goal 
that’s great, but you also have to 
remember to have fun and enjoy 
it.”
***
Like 
Natalie, 
one 
of 
the 
greatest pieces of advice I have 

ever gotten is “If you don’t wake 
up every day excited that you do 
what you do, you’re not doing the 
right thing.”
That piece of advice has 
stuck with me, lingering in the 
back of my mind when someone 
inevitably questions what I could 
possibly want to do in sports, if 
I have a backup plan in case it 
doesn’t work out, what studying 
“sport 
management” 
even 
means. 
Plocki, who is in her 29th 
season as head coach for the 
Wolverines, 
gives 
the 
same 
advice to her athletes. 
“Understand that there will be 
days that you don’t enjoy it, and 

so never base any decision off of 
a bad day,” Plocki said. “You have 
to enjoy what you’re doing every 
day to be able to put the kind of 
passion and work ethic into it. 
And to somebody like Natalie, 
or anybody that’s on our team, I 
tell my athletes all the time that 
you’re here because you have a 
passion to want to do this, and 
part of that passion is continuing 
to grow and excel.” 
This advice, though simple 
and 
pretty 
common-sensical, 
has gotten me, an excessively 
ambitious and optimistic student 
and sports fan, through barrages 
of skepticism and doubt. It 
has also gotten an extremely 

accomplished gymnast through 
the days of failure, of injury, of 
uncertainty. 
As women pursuing careers 
in sports, be it as an athlete, a 
journalist, a CEO of a franchise, 
an analyst, a broadcaster, we 
have gone through years of 
questions, the metaphorical falls 
and hyperextensions. 
So, if you are a Natalie Wojcik 
 
— an aspiring athlete — or 
someone who is pushing for that 
proverbial perfect 10, Plocki has 
one last piece of advice for you:
“Go after your dream. If you 
want to do something in your 
heart, then find a way to go do it.” 

KATELYN MULCAHY/Daily
Freshman Natalie Wojcik posted a perfect ‘10’, the 28th on vault in Michigan program history and the first such accomplishment since the 2011 season.

For Charles 
Matthews, 
it’s back to 
normal

DES 
MOINES, 
Iowa 
— 
Charles 
Matthews ran down the floor with some 
urgency, shooting the moment the ball 
came to him. He heard the buzzer sound, 
saw the basket light up red and the ball roll 
around the rim with the guise of a shooter’s 
bounce, before falling out. Then he smiled. 
There was no reason for frustration.
Matthews, at that point, already had 11 
points on the night, more than he scored 
in the last two combined. He finished with 
22 on 8-of-12 shooting with 10 rebounds, 
which wouldn’t be particularly notable 
for him in a 74-59 win over Montana that 
defined routine, if the redshirt junior’s last 
month had gone normally.
But 25 days ago against Michigan State, 
Matthews got hurt and decided to play the 
second half through it. He finished that 
game with four points on 1-of-8 shooting, 
too hobbled to guard Cassius Winston or 
Matt McQuaid. Then he sat the next three.
“Dumb,” Matthews said of that decision 
last week in Chicago. “But you just get lost 
in the game sometimes. And I know I’m a 
competitor. I don’t think I’m much like no 
macho man or anything like that. I’ve got 
some toughness to me. It wasn’t the best 
decision at the time.”
When he said that, it was in Michigan’s 
locker room after a similarly nonchalant 
Big Ten Tournament win over Iowa. 
Matthews donned a brace in his first game 
back, played well enough on defense to 
mask any hurt but shot 1-of-9 from the 
field. That would have been an admission 
that he wasn’t 100 percent if Matthews 
didn’t make the confession himself.
Instead of being a part of the stretch 
run, and a second loss to the Spartans in 
which the Big Ten title was in the balance, 
Matthews sat on the bench. Instead of 
being able to give his best in the Big Ten 
Tournament, Matthews played with that 
brace, struggled, and the Wolverines lost to 
the Spartans again.
This came after a period in which 
Matthews played some of his best 
basketball and spoke at his loudest, publicly 
admonishing his team after a loss at Penn 
State and earning the full trust of his 
coaches in the process.
“When you got a player-led team this 
time of year, they’ve been through the 
ways,” said assistant coach DeAndre 
Haynes. “They’ve been on the floor. So 
they see some things that we don’t see. I 
was like that as a player, too. You see things 
like, ‘Hey, coach, we should do this.’ And if 
they feel like it’s gonna work, we trust them 
that it’s gonna be the right thing.”
On Thursday night, the brace was off 
and Matthews was every bit himself, and 
maybe a little more.
“I was happy just to be out there the 
last few games,” Matthews said. “It’s still a 
different atmosphere when you go, feel like 
yourself a little.”
Early in the game, as Grizzlies point 
guard Timmy Falls took what appeared 
to be an uncontested layup, Matthews 
swooped in over him, forcing a miss and 
prompting one member of Montana’s 
traveling party sitting on press row 
to exclaim, “Jesus.” The lone time the 
Grizzlies seemed to pull themselves within 
arms length, cutting the Wolverines’ lead 
to eight early in the second half, Matthews 
followed a Jordan Poole 3-pointer with a 
long two from the corner. Then he drifted 
into space beyond the arc off a Zavier 
Simpson drive and found bottom on a 
three.
Michigan’s lead never dipped below 
14 again. And if the Wolverines are to do 
more this month than beat up on a 15-seed, 
that’s the type of game they need from 
Matthews.
“It means everything for us, because 
when he’s able to play at this level, it opens 
up so much more for us offensively,” 
said assistant coach Saddi Washington. 
“Because it’s another guy in our arsenal to 
have to take account for.”
It’s more than that, though. Matthews is 
one of the most forceful voices in the locker 
room, one of the driving forces behind this 
team’s success on both sides of the floor. He 
and John Beilein agreed that they wouldn’t 
go over the top in rehabbing to get back 
for the postseason. Matthews was, by all 
accounts, as much a coach on the bench 
as any of the actual coaches. He still hated 
sitting.
Through all of that, though, the goal 
stayed the same. It still does. Matthews 
remembers the feeling of sitting in 
the locker room last year as Villanova 
celebrated down the hall. He wants to 
avoid it. “We really just, will feel empty if 
we don’t take it all this year,” he said.
So, as Matthews walked through 
the tunnel, slapping hands and signing 
autographs after an NCAA Tournament 
game in which he was the star — a moment 
in which he could have revelled — he had 
just three words.
“Let’s get it.”

DES MOINES, Iowa — Last year, 
when Michigan played Montana 
in the first round of the NCAA 
Tournament, 
the 
Grizzlies 
got 
out to a quick 10-0 lead before the 
Wolverines found a groove and won.
Watching film of that game ahead 
of the rematch, Michigan players 
cringed. This time, they knew 
they would allow no such thing. 
Sure enough, this time it was the 
Wolverines (29-6) who started the 
game off on a 10-2 run.
It 
seemed 
that 
every shot Montana 
took 
— 
threes, 
layups, 
even 
a 
fast-break 
dunk 
attempt — missed. 
The 
Wolverines’ 
shooting 
wasn’t 
particularly potent, 
either, 
but 
their 
defense 
clamped 
down, holding the 
Grizzlies 
to 
33 
percent from the field.
“We were really ready for them,” 
said 
freshman 
forward 
Ignas 
Brazdeikis. “And our intensity — I 
felt like we were really connected.”
Montana (26-9), a No. 15 seed 
out of the Big Sky Conference 
that doesn’t start anyone taller 
than 6-foot-7, had no answer for 
Michigan’s relentlessness.
It was a microcosm of everything 
Michigan has been all season. Lots 
of defense, just enough offense, 

loads of personality and — when all 
was said and done — a 74-55 win.
“It’s a lot of fun,” said freshman 
forward Ignas Brazdeikis. “When 
we play good defense it turns into 
offense for us I feel like. When we’re 
playing on defense then offensively 
we play good and we made stops, we 
got rebounds, we went out and run, 
we just had a lot of fun out there and 
I think it showed.”
Montana, which won the Big 
Sky thanks in large part to its 
3-point shooting, missed its first 
nine attempts from deep, clanking 
shot 
after 
shot. 
The 
Wolverines 
struggled 
from 
three, too, hitting 
just 5-for-17. But the 
difference was that 
they found passing 
lanes and got to the 
basket. 
Michigan 
had four dunks in 
the first half alone — 
including one where 
Brazdeikis knocked 
the ball away from Montana guard 
Donaven Dorsey and took it down 
the court for the slam, drawing a 
foul in the process. Junior guard 
Zavier 
Simpson 
finished 
with 
10 assists, creating looks for the 
offense all night. He frequently 
found Brazdeikis and junior center 
Jon Teske for open alley-oop layups 
and dunks, introducing a new hook 
shot-style pass in the process.
And in a size mismatch, the 
Wolverines’ 
forwards 
shined. 

Redshirt 
junior 
wing 
Charles 
Matthews got a double-double — 
scoring 22 points with 10 rebounds. 
Teske finished with double digits 
with 11 points and nine rebounds. 
Brazdeikis and sophomore guard 
Jordan Poole were also in double 
digits, with 14 and 10 points, 
respectively.
At the beginning of the second 
half, Montana briefly cut its deficit 
to eight with buckets on two 
consecutive possessions — including 
just its second three of the game — 
but Michigan responded with a 10-0 
run spurred by two consecutive 
Matthews triples and an alley-oop 
dunk by Teske.
“Right away, we responded,” said 
Michigan coach John Beilein. “So it 
was huge. Some of those points, if I 
recall, were not pretty points. We 
just got points.”
From there, the Wolverines kept 
rolling. They took a 20-point lead 
with 8:29 remaining and led by 
at least that much until the final 
seconds, when the freshmen and 
walk-ons got their time on the 
court.
As with many of their previous 
games against inferior opponents, 
the Wolverines didn’t always look 
their best, shooting 49 percent 
from the field and committing 10 
turnovers. But every time one of 
the Grizzlies tried to wiggle his 
way around a much bigger and 
more physical Michigan player, 
it was clear that Montana was 
overmatched.

‘M’ relishes 
‘boring’ win 
in Tourney 
opener

DES MOINES, Iowa — As Michigan 
stormed out to an early but indestructible 
lead Thursday night against Montana, 
the word of choice across social media 
was “boring.” By the time the Wolverines 
jogged down the tunnel at halftime with a 
34-21 advantage that felt more comfortable 
than that, many back at home had already 
flipped to the evening’s more competitive 
action. Those inside Wells Fargo Arena 
surely wished they could do the same.
But in the moments after the eventual 
74-55 win, when a reporter began to relay 
that description to assistant coach Luke 
Yaklich, he interrupted midway through 
the question:
“Nah, I freaking loved it.”
The thing is, Michigan likes it this 
way. Eventually, the reporter finished his 
question. Yaklich, in typical form, followed 
with a minute-long response detailing 
the minutiae of the Wolverines’ defensive 
performance — a smile glued to his face the 
entire time.
Eventually, he got to his defense’s 
contest rate — 90 percent — and had to 
pause. His smile had become too wide to 
speak through.
Elsewhere in the Michigan locker room, 
Yaklich’s energy wasn’t quite mirrored, 
but the attitude was. No one, not even this 
Wolverines team that ranks second in the 
country in adjusted defensive efficiency, 
shares Yaklich’s childlike joy for defense, 
but they respect it. Even if that means 
winning “boring.”
“I don’t take this as a boring win,” said 
junior guard Zavier Simpson. “I actually 
take this as an exciting win. We got an 
opportunity to win the first game. That’s 
something that can be hard, especially 
with a team that doesn’t have as much 
hype that can be difficult to play.”
Throughout the locker room, the 
mood wasn’t celebratory as it was after 
blowout wins over Iowa and Minnesota 
in Michigan’s first two games of the Big 
Ten tournament. There was no distracting 
players as they answered questions or 
posing for triumphant pictures. But, unlike 
Sunday in Chicago, there were smiles and 
chatter.
It may not be an attitude that feels 
befitting of an NCAA Tournament win, 
but these Wolverines don’t need it to be. 
They know what comes next. Last year’s 
second-round matchup with Houston 
earned thousands of adjectives; boring was 
not among them. They also know what 
came before — a titanic, back-and-forth Big 
Ten championship game against Michigan 
State — and how that one ended.
“The Michigan State game was the 
Michigan State game,” Yakich said. “It was 
over. The NCAA Tournament for our guys 
who are used to making deep runs and 
having success in these type of games. It’s 
kind of tabula rasa there and we wiped the 
slate clean.”
This, a 15 vs. 2 game whose biggest 
storyline was that the same matchup 
happened last year, didn’t need any 
extraneous excitement. Within minutes, 
Michigan raced out to a 10-2 lead. By the 
8:25 mark, it was 21-6. Montana didn’t hit 
double digits until 6:09 remained.
So when the Wolverines re-emerged 
from halftime, there was no need for 
a spirited team talk. Jordan Poole and 
Jon Teske shared a relaxed smile before 
dapping up and going to defend their 
respective assignments. Beilein paced the 
Michigan sideline, arms crossed, before 
clapping in his team’s direction. “Let’s go, 
let’s go, let’s go.”
For a few minutes, the Wolverines failed 
to heed their coach’s advice. Montana, on 
a pair of baskets that were far easier than 
Beilein would have liked, cut the lead to 
eight. Then, the Michigan team of the first 
half returned. On a quarter of unanswered 
Simpson assists, the lead was back to 18.
“When you got a point guard who can 
just find your shooters, like (sophomore 
guard Jordan Poole), who, he didn’t have 
it going,” said assistant coach DeAndre 
Haynes. “So (Simpson) will tell him, ‘Hey, 
be ready, I’m gonna find you.’ And then 
those guys are locked in, ready to shoot. 
Same thing with (sophomore forward 
Isaiah Livers). Isaiah was open in the 
corner, he said, ‘Hey, be ready, I’m gonna 
find you.’ And that’s the type of point guard 
you want to play for.”
The rest of the night was back to 
boring, even if the Wolverines’ coaching 
staff refuses to view any game that way. 
On offense, coach John Beilein aired 
frustration. But on defense, it was Yaklich’s 
voice filling the air.
But back in the locker room, there was 
no displeasure to be found. This — a win, 
regardless of style points — was all that the 
Wolverines wanted.
“We’re trying to do something a lot 
bigger than just the first game,” Simpson 
said. “But we can’t accomplish that without 
winning the game in front of us.”

taking care of Grizz-ness

Michigan jumps all over Montana, advances to round of 32

DES MOINES, Iowa — Jon Teske 
crashed to the floor under the basket, 
hit from behind by a Montana defender. 
On the Michigan sideline, John Beilein 
turned to assistant coach Luke Yaklich.
“That’s 
a 
cheap 
shot!” 
Beilein 
exclaimed in disbelief.
If Beilein was right, maybe the 
Grizzlies just didn’t have another choice. 
If that’s the conclusion they came to, no 
one could really blame them.
Basketball, in its crudest form, is a 
game of height, and the Wolverines’ 
NCAA Tournament opener against 
Montana on Thursday was far from 
the most refined version of the sport. 
Michigan committed 12 turnovers and 
shot 29 percent from 3-point range. 
Montana was even worse, hitting just 20 
of 60 field goals and scoring 0.81 points 
per possession.
Ultimately, what gave the Wolverines 
a 74-55 win was just enough scoring and 
a defense as stingy it has been all season. 
And as usual, the defensive performance 
was anchored down low with Teske.
Teams from the Big Sky don’t usually 
match up physically with No. 2 seeds 
from the Big Ten. The Grizzlies are no 
exception — and that was before their 
regular starting center, Jamar Akoh, 

was lost for the season due to injury. In 
Akoh’s place, they’ve been forced to start 
Bobby Moorhead, a 6-foot-7, 192-pound 
shooting guard by trade, in the middle. 
Against the 7-foot-1 Teske, this went 
about how you would expect.
Teske had 11 points and nine rebounds 
in his 23 minutes on the court, Michigan 
outscored Montana by 25 points. The 
junior center constantly impacted shots 
around the rim, and on offense, the 
Grizzlies simply couldn’t deny him.
“He’s a mismatch problem,” said 
freshman forward Ignas Brazdeikis. 
“They’re all really short, so just get him 
the ball. He can make plays, he can kick 
out, he can score.”
While the Big Ten has no shortage 
of physical beasts down low, the 
Wolverines 
spent 
most 
of 
non-
conference play dealing with smaller 
teams — Teske said Thursday reminded 
him of Michigan’s 56-37 win over 
Holy Cross in November, in which the 
Crusaders caught the Wolverines off-
guard at first with a series of small-ball 
centers.
This time, Michigan was ready.
“Just throw it up top,” Zavier Simpson 
told The Daily. “This guy is big — go up 
top and have him go get it. They wanna 
score, make a play, he’s gonna get it.”
Montana threw a twist in, however. 
It knew the Wolverines would be able to 

easily run offense through Teske, so its 
defensive strategy focused on denying 
him the ball in the first place. The 
Grizzlies tried to trap Simpson on the 
perimeter and switch on screens, just as 
many of Michigan’s Big Ten opponents 
have done.
Simpson said that he was impressed 
with Montana’s ball-screen coverage. 
But in a manner exemplary of the 
mismatch in sheer talent and physicality, 
the junior point guard still ended up 
with 10 assists — four of which Teske 
finished off.
“In the Big Ten, any time a team 
switches, now you got a 6-7, 6-8 guy 
switching on (Simpson), which makes 
that post entry pass a little bit tougher,” 
said assistant coach Saddi Washington. 
“They were 6-(foot)-3, 6-4, 6-5, and so 
we just basically had a jump ball-type 
pass that only Jon can get.”
Defensively, Teske although he didn’t 
record a blocked shot — altered the 
flow of the Grizzlies’ normally effective 
downhill 
penetration. 
Montana’s 
guards found their lanes to the basket 
completely shut off. As a result, the 
Grizzlies’ outside shooting suffered — 
they hit just five of 19 from beyond the 
arc.
