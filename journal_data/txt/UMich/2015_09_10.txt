CELEBRATING OUR ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FIFTH YEAR OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Administrators say 
departments, units 
will guide strategic 
planning process

By LARA MOEHLMAN

Daily Staff Reporter

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel hosted a second diversi-
ty summit Wednesday afternoon 
in which he further outlined the 
University’s plans to improve 
equity and inclusion on campus.

During the summit, the presi-

dent emphasized the drive behind 
the planning process:

“Dedication to academic excel-

lence for the public good is insep-
arable from our commitment to 
diversity, equity and inclusion,” 
he said. “We cannot be excel-
lent without being diverse in the 
broadest sense of that word.”

The meeting was closed to the 

press, but was live streamed on 
the University’s website.

Though a complete strate-

gic plan has yet to be released, 
Schlissel detailed goals dur-
ing Wednesday’s event to direct 
about 60 appointed facilitators 
within each college and campus 
unit to collaborate with faculty, 
staff and students to design their 
own programs for enhancing 
diversity within their units.

These planning leaders will 

be responsible for overseeing the 
planning process within their 
specific areas as well as partici-
pating in coordination with the 
overall campus diversity efforts.

Schlissel 
emphasized 
that 

success in enhancing diversity 
largely depends on the collective 
efforts of each individual depart-
ment rather than simply the cen-
tral administration.

“At this stage, we’re not seek-

ing to define where we will end 
up or what success will necessar-
ily look like,” he said. “We want 
to have a structure in place that 
will allow us to engage the great 
minds and passionate individuals 
on our campus and to move for-
ward in a collaborative manner.

WARREN, Mich. — At the 

first stop of his administration’s 
nationwide Back-to-School tour 

Wednesday, President Barack 
Obama returned to Macomb 
Community College in Warren, 
Mich. to champion increased 
access to affordable education 
and vocational training.

Traveling with Dr. Jill Biden, a 

community college professor and 
the wife of Vice President Joe 
Biden, the president discussed 
his administration’s efforts to 
expand funding for apprentice-
ships and promote initiatives to 
make community college free.

“I want two years of commu-

nity college to be as free and uni-
versal as high school is today,” 
Obama said.

Before 
Obama 
began 
his 

26-minute speech, Biden — who 
has taught at a community college 
for more than 20 years — touted 
the Obama administration’s focus 
on education, citing investment 
in early childhood education and 
efforts to increase the number of 
students graduating high school 
and attending college.

During 
her 
speech, 
Biden 

announced she would serve as 
chair of the College Promise Advi-
sory Board, a new independent 
commission composed of commu-
nity college leaders, policymakers, 
businesses and foundations that 
will explore ways to expand exist-
ing programs that provide free 
two-year college degrees.

During his State of the Union 

address in January, Obama pro-
posed a $60 billion program that

The Michigan State Legis-

lature reconvenes today after 
months away on hiatus for sum-
mer break. After key propos-
als — such as Proposal 1 to fix 
Michigan’s roads — failed to pass 
in the last session, here is a recap 
of issues to watch as the year 
unfolds. 

Roads

While many Michigan resi-

dents agree the state’s roads are 
in poor condition, legislators 
have yet to agree on how to fix 
them.

The last session ended with 78 

percent of voters defeating Pro-
posal 1.

The proposed bill would have 

increased the Earned Income 
Tax Credit, removed the fuel tax 
and increased the sales tax from 
6 to 7 percent. 

Several 
road 
improvement 

proposals are already on the 

docket for introduction in both 
Michigan’s House of Repre-
sentatives and Senate. Over the 
summer, legislators held several 
closed-door meetings to discuss 
potential plans to increase road 
funding.

House Bill 4440 aims to create 

a distinct transportation fund in 
the state treasury where money 
will be allocated for road repairs. 
The proposed bill provides $2.5 
million to go specifically toward 
annual road improvement with 
the percentage of funds to be 
divided based on the area’s popu-
lation — 40 percent would go to 
communities with 1,000,000 to 
1,749,999 residents, for exam-
ple. HB 4611 similarly creates a 
transportation fund within the 
state treasury, but in this version, 
would be funded through special 
vehicle and fuel taxes.

Rep. 
Jeff 
Irwin 
(D–Ann 

Arbor) said while he would like 
to see a roads bill pass, he doesn’t 
currently see one he supports.

“I don’t think a good bill to fix 

the roads will pass, but I hope it 
does,” Irwin said. “I would vote 
for a balanced plan to fix our 
roads, coupled with rolling back 
the Republican tax increases on 
the working poor. But, I don’t see

Students talk foreign 
affairs, negotiations 

as review period 
nears conclusion

By ISOBEL FUTTER

Daily Staff Reporter

The Iran Deal has dominated 

conversation 
in 
Washington 

since it was negotiated this sum-
mer, and many University stu-
dents are joining in. 

Officially known as the Joint 

Comprehensive Plan of Action, 
the Iran Deal was announced in 
late July by the Obama admin-
istration. The JCPOA is a pro-
posal designed to significantly 
decrease Iran’s nuclear program 
in exchange for reduced sanc-
tions by the P5+1 countries — the 
United States, the United King-
dom, China, France, Russia and 
Germany.

If the deal goes into effect, 

Iran would be allowed to have 
a small amount of enriched ura-
nium and materials. The permit-

ted amount would not be large 
enough to create a nuclear bomb, 
according to experts. In return 
for reducing their nuclear sup-
ply, Iran would receive sanctions 
relief.

The deal has been lauded as 

a historic agreement by sup-
porters. But for some University 
students, the deal hits close to 
home.

University retains 
No. 4 spot among 
public universities 

By TANAZ AHMED

Daily Staff Reporter

The University ranked 29th in 

this year’s U.S. News and World 
Report survey of the country’s 
best colleges released Wednes-
day, maintaining its spot from 
the 2015 rankings.

The University also retained 

its public university ranking 
from the previous year, holding 
on to the fourth-place spot.

The University of California, 

Berkeley, ranked as the num-
ber-one public institution, with 
University of California, Los 
Angeles, and University of Vir-
ginia ranked second and third, 
respectively.

The Ross School of Business 

was rated the nation’s fourth-
best 
undergraduate 
business 

school, maintaining its rank-
ing from last year. The College 
of Engineering came in at sixth 
place for best undergraduate 
engineering 
programs, 
mov-

ing up from last year’s seventh 
place.

A look at Detroit’s underground 
music scene


the Iranian Graduate Students 
Association. As an Iranian stu-
dent studying in the United States, 
disagreements between the two 
countries have been challenging to 
witness. 

Arbabzadeh came to the United 

States several years ago to pursue a 
master’s degree in electrical engi-
neering. Due to tensions between 
the United States and Iran, there is 
no U.S. embassy in Tehran, Iran — 
Arbabzadeh’s home city. 

According to Arbabzadeh fur-

ther cooperation between the 
United States and Iran could help 
foster better accommodation for 
students.

“Iranians in the U.S. started the 

movement to show that they sup-
port the deal,” Arbabzadeh said. 
“There is a hashtag, #SupportIran-
Deal, because we want to show it 
all around the world and say that 
we support it.”

When details of the JCPOA 

were released in July, Arbabzadeh 
was home in Iran. She remembers 
people filling the streets and cheer-
ing, in hopes that the reduced sanc-
tions would help bring lower prices 
for goods, such as food and medi-
cine.

“My aunt had breast cancer last 

year, but the medicine she needed 
couldn’t be found, and was super 
expensive because of the sanc-
tions,” Arbabzadeh said. “I got it 
here for her and I went back home 
to give it to her.”

Politically affiliated pro-Israel 

groups on campus have voiced var-
ied stances on the JCPOA.

J Street, a national pro-Israel 

organization, 
announced 
their 

support for the deal in early Sep-
tember. Though members of the 
campus chapter declined to com-
ment, they said they agree with the 
statement posted on the organiza-
tion’s website.

“Having studied the text of the 

agreement, J Street intends to back 
it and work hard for its implemen-
tation, making the case to Con-
gress that this agreement serves 
the vital security interests of both 
the United States and Israel,” the 
organization wrote in their official 
release.

However, not all pro-Israel 

organizations on campus are for 
the deal.

LSA senior Daniel Pearlman 

is part of an organization called 
WolvPAC, a political on campus 
that advocates for a stronger Isra-
el-U.S. relationship. Pearlman said 
he has read the agreement himself, 
and does not feel that it is a good 
deal.

“I am for diplomacy and I am in 

favor of negotiation, even with a 
theocratic regime like Iran,” Pearl-
man said. “However, I am against 
this current deal because it fails to 
address numerous critical issues 
that are important — not just in my 
opinion, but also in the opinion of 
many other Americans and people 
who are living in the region.”

One problem that Pearlman 

has with the deal is that it does 
not include “anytime, anywhere” 
inspections on nuclear facilities 
and military facilities in Iran. 

Pearlman said WolvPAC is 

working on campus to educate 
others and encourage conversa-
tion about the deal.

“We want people to under-

stand more about this deal, and 
why it isn’t necessarily the best 
option that we have,” Pearlman 
said.

The deal, which is under a 

60-day congressional review, is 
expected to considered by Con-
gress this month. Due to the 
nature of the deal as an interna-
tional executive agreement, and 
not a treaty, Congress cannot vote 
to approve the bill. Instead, they 
will vote on whether or not to 
disapprove the deal. Many mem-
bers of the Senate and House of 

Representatives are attempting to 
win a vote of disapproval, a ruling 
that would need to be subsequently 
vetoed by President Obama if the 
deal were to pass.

Many opponents of the deal say 

Iran cannot be trusted. Some also 
believe relieving sanctions from 
Iran would allow the country to 
use its unfrozen assets to funnel 
money toward terrorist groups.

It would take a two-thirds vote 

from Congress to overrule the 
president’s veto of a disapproval 
resolution, a number that is now 
unlikely. The necessary 34 Demo-
cratic senators have announced 
support for the deal — meaning 
they would not vote for a disap-
proval resolution.

Rep. Debbie Dingell (D–Mich.) 

and Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D–
Mich.) have both released state-
ments in support of the deal. Sen. 
Gary Peters (D–Mich.) announced 
his support on Tuesday morning.

“The United States and our allies 

seek peace in the Middle East,” 
Dingell wrote in her statement. 
“We have two goals: promoting 
peace and keeping the confidence 
of our allies who need American 
leadership. The JCPOA helps sup-
port both of these goals, which is 
why I will support it.”

Most 
Michigan 
Republicans 

have released statements of dis-
approval. 
Michigan 
Attorney 

General 
Bill 
Schuette, 
along-

side Oklahoma Attorney Gen-
eral Scott Pruitt, released a www.
michigandaily.com/section/news/
schuette-urges-states-impose-
sanctions-iran letter to all 50 state 
governors encouraging them to 
impose state-regulated sanctions. 
Schuette argued that though the 
nation wants to lower sanctions 
in return for Iran’s cooperation, 
states could still impose their own 
sanctions.

John Ciorciari, assistant profes-

sor of public policy, said University 
students should stay away from 
distorted stories in the media.

“I think it’s very important for 

anyone interested in this deal to get 
beyond the nightly news, and espe-
cially beyond the often polemical 
stories on the evening cable news 
shows,” Ciorciari said. “Students 
should read the terms on the deal 
and read expert commentaries of a 
variety of perspectives.”

This is a process that’s about 
your voices and your ideas.”

Schlissel added that the indi-

vidual plans are due by the end 
of this academic year, and will 
be compounded into a com-
prehensive University plan to 
improve diversity, which will 
be set in place for September 
2016.

“We know the process itself 

will be neither easy nor quick,” 
he said. “We will disagree at 
times, but the structure we’ve 
built is designed to encour-
age discussion, the sharing of 
successful programs and the 
development of new ideas. We 
want to encourage innovation 
to set broad parameters; not 
prescribed boxes.”

The president outlined pro-

grams already in place at the 
University to improve diver-
sity and inclusion, including a 
program to package admission 
offers and financial aid awards. 
He also said the University 
plans to reach out earlier to stu-
dents with incomplete applica-

tions and to improve outreach 
to admitted students before 
they decide to enroll. Kedra 
Ishop, the University’s associ-
ate vice president for enroll-
ment management, led these 
efforts.

Schlissel told The Michi-

gan Daily last week that these 
ongoing efforts would result 
in visible impacts to this year’s 
freshman enrollment numbers 
— a sentiment he echoed during 
Wednesday’s luncheon.

In recent years, Black enroll-

ment at the University has 
hovered around 4 percent — a 
reality that has in part driven 
calls for new diversity efforts 
on campus. During the tail end 
of President Emerita Mary Sue 
Coleman’s tenure, members of 
the University’s Black Student 
Union called on the University 
to address several issues related 
to inclusion, equity and diver-
sity.

The University will also 

launch a pilot program this 
year to improve the recruit-
ment of students from economi-
cally disadvantaged families 
throughout Michigan. The pro-
gram was developed with the 

help of Susan Dynarski, a Uni-
versity professor of education, 
economics and public policy. 
Known as the Hail Scholars 
Program, the effort is designed 
to increase applications to the 
University from high-achieving 
low-income students.

University Provost Martha 

Pollack and Doug Strong, then-
interim chief financial officer, 
previously set up a staff com-
mittee on diversity, equity and 
inclusion, chaired by Laurita 
Thomas, associate vice presi-
dent for human resources. They 
submitted their recommenda-
tions to enhance staff diversity 
and inclusiveness last month, 
and the report was posted 
online today.

So far, new faculty orienta-

tion this year included a session 
on leveraging student diversity 
in classroom discussions. Plans 
are in the process to extend this 
training to all faculty.

After remarks from the presi-

dent, Robert Sellers, University 
vice provost for equity, inclu-
sion and academic affairs, and 
Regent Shauna Ryder Diggs (D), 
tables of attendees discussed 
ideas for the improvement of 

diversity on campus. Facili-
tators at each table recorded 
the attendants’ ideas to con-
tribute to the University’s 
plan. 

The University is plan-

ning 
a 
University-wide 

diversity summit scheduled 
for November.

would guarantee qualified stu-
dents two free years of communi-
ty college. The plan has yet to gain 
traction in Congress.

Biden 
said 
students 
face 

decades of debt and that it’s hard 
to get ahead in the workforce 

when Americans are struggling to 
keep up.

“If we want all Americans to 

succeed in the 21st century we 
need to make sure that all stu-
dents at all ages have the best edu-
cation possible,” she said.

Obama also announced the 

board’s plans to launch Heads 
Up America, a public campaign 
designed to garner support for the 

nation’s community colleges.

Obama also discussed his sup-

port 
for 
apprenticeships 
and 

training opportunities as a means 
of making America more competi-
tive within the world economy. He 
argued Americans must be able to 
adapt and improve their skills.

“Everything is moving too fast 

and if you don’t have the skills to 
get the new jobs and you don’t 

have the knowledge to adapt and 
be creative, you’re going to fall 
behind,” Obama said, noting a 
study that found workers who 
completed 
an 
apprenticeship 

made $300,000 more than their 
peers over a lifetime.

“Upgrading your skills pays 

off,” he added.

The Obama administration is 

pledging $200 million to promote 

apprenticeships 
and 
training 

opportunities, with the Depart-
ment of Labor awarding $175 mil-
lion in grants to 46 public-private 
partnerships that have commit-
ted to expanding high-quality 
apprenticeships.

“This is a concrete way to 

reduce the cost of higher educa-
tion for young people, to improve 
the skills of workers so they 

get higher paying jobs, to grow 
our economy,” Obama said. “It 
shouldn’t be controversial.”

The president will continue to 

speak about affordable education 
over the next week and a half, 
with First Lady Michelle Obama 
and Secretary of Education Arne 
Duncan joining him at later tour 
stops.

such a bill coming forward.”

Higher Education

Despite receiving a 1.4 percent 

increase in state funding from 2014, 
tuition still increased at the Univer-
sity, with officials noting that the 
small increase could not make up 
for a nearly decade-long trend of 
declining state funds.

But the 2.7 percent tuition 

increase for in-state students and 
the 3.7 percent increase for out-

of-state students is still smaller 
compared to the 8 percent tuition 
increase students at Oakland Uni-
versity, and the 7.8 percent increase 
students at Eastern University 
enacted this year in response to 
funding challenges.

Irwin said his fundamental high-

er education initiative this year is to 
increase state financial support.

“Mainly, the goal is to get more 

state support for our universities,” 
Irwin said.

LGBTQ rights

Over the summer the U.S. 

Supreme Court ruled same-sex 

marriage legal in the United States. 
The historic decision featued the 
Michigan plaintiffs, who spoke 
at oral arguements for the case in 
April.

However, LGBTQ residents in 

Michigan are still facing other hur-
dles.

In June, Gov. Rick Snyder (R) 

signed a bill that would allow adop-
tion agencies to deny applications 
from same-sex couples on religious 
grounds. In Michigan, there is no 
provision outlawing discrimination 
in housing or employment based on 
sexual orientation or gender iden-

tity.

Last year, amendments to the 

Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act — 
which would have granted these 
protections — failed to pass the leg-
islature. 

“We need to get the bigoted lan-

guage out of our law books,” Irwin 
said. “More importantly, we should 
amend our state civil rights law to 
include protections for LGBT citi-
zens. Nobody should be fired from 
their job or denied housing because 
of their sexual orientation or gender 
identity.” 

Marijuana

Irwin, who attended Hash Bash 

last year in April 2015, is a vocal 
proponent of marijuana legal-
ization in the state of Michigan. 
During the last legislative session 
Irwin introduced a bill to decrimi-
nalize the drug, but this session he 
said he hopes to go a step further 
and introduce a bill to legalize it.

Irwin, calling it time “to end 

this long and failed experiment 
with prohibition,” said he intends 
to introduce a bill in the coming 
weeks that would be similar to 
Colorado’s, which allows adult use.

He asks voters to sign his www.

milegalize.com petition to land 
marijuana legalization on the state 
ballot in 2016; however, the chanc-
es of it passing are slim. A recent 
Michigan Radio poll showed 40.2 
percent of Michigan voters oppose 
legalization of marijuana for rec-
reational use, 4.2 percent of voters 
are unsure, and the remaining 55.7 
percent are in favor of legalization 
but divided on the logistics.

In the meantime, Michigan 

legislators are working on bills to 
crack down on the current law 
which allows medical use of mari-
juana.

I 

will never sit in a cubicle. I will 
never have to worry about the 
finances of running a small 

business, owning 
a company car or 
creating a presen-
tation for a board 
meeting. 
And 

I will never have to worry about 
these things and more if I continue 
on my path toward medical school. 
Those things make me happy. But 
does my major?

When we were in third grade, our 

teachers asked us the most important 
question of our lives, “What do you 
want to be when you grow up?” At the 
time, I’m sure most of us answered 
“astronaut” or something else that 
sounded acceptable in the mind of an 
eight-year-old. We didn’t realize just 
how important that question actually 
was or how long it might take to find 
an answer.

In middle school, our perceptive 

changed slightly to more realistic 
careers such as becoming musicians, 
authors and doctors, while high 
school finely tuned our answers 
even further to journalists, athletes 
and surgeons once things became 
more serious. Until senior year rolled 
around and it was time to start filling 
out college applications, I never once 
looked back on my decision to attend 
medical school.

And yet there I was, freezing on 

the “concentration/major” box fill-
ing out the Common Application, 
unable to move the mouse. Through 
all the confusion, a question formed 
at the forefront of my mind: Why 
was I hesitating? Two years later, 
I’d chalk it up to my subconscious 
trying to tell my heart something 
it didn’t want to accept: Maybe I 
didn’t want to do biology. In that 
moment, I felt like a child putting 
their hands over their ears, repeat-
ing a mantra of lalalala to keep the 
truth away. I was good at biology, 
right? You needed a biology degree 
to get into medical school, right? I 
didn’t just need to take biology; I 
needed to major in biology and love 
biology if I wanted a shot at becom-

ing the doctor that I always envi-
sioned in my future. At least that’s 
what I told myself when I hesitantly 
typed “biology” into that little box.

“Do What You Want” is a chapter 

in Amy Poehler’s novel “Yes Please.” 
She essentially argues that to be 
happy, we need to follow what we 
want to do in life. As she goes on to 
detail her early struggles as a rising 
comedian in an unforgiving industry, 
you can’t help but notice the great 
success that came with her hard 
work. Of course, all fans of “Satur-
day Night Live” and the ever-popular 
series “Parks and Recreation” know 
the name Amy Poehler, whether by 
her sparkling identity or constant 
enthusiasm as herself or her per-
sona, Leslie Knope. But only readers 
of her novel can truly see the depths 
of her love for work — not once in the 
novel did I remember reading that 
she was unhappy. Even as a comedy 
nobody in a small Chicago improv 
theatre, Poehler remarked that she 
was incredibly happy with her new 
“family.” Reading “Yes Please” was 
not only a small piece of happiness to 
feed the “Parks and Recreation” fan 
inside of me, but also an educational 
experience about life itself, especially 
college life.

Do what you want, whatever 

makes you happy, is an essential 
piece of advice all students enter-
ing college should carry with them. 
I had entered freshman year car-
rying the uncertainty of my con-
centration on my shoulders, and 
I didn’t even know it. Biology was 
something that I felt was neces-
sary to my success, not something 
that was bringing me happiness. 
Acceptance is the hardest part of 
any failed relationship, and this 
relationship was slowly but surely 
becoming a one-way street. To 
become happy in your work, some-
times you need to make the hard 
decision to let go of things that have 
become detrimental to your hap-
piness. Unfortunately, that might 
mean breaking up with your major 
if it just isn’t working for you.

When first-year requirements 

dictated that foreign language was 
required to graduate from LSA, 
I became excited to once again 
immerse myself in a topic I had 
adored in high school. This was 
especially so when Lorena, my 
fabulous instructor, added an equal 
mix of passion and fun to the lan-
guage that spurred me to partici-
pate actively in class once more. I 
found myself excited to do home-
work and to attend class each day 
again. I adored Spanish and came 
to the simple and quick decision 
that I would pursue a dual degree 
with the language as my other 
major, which ultimately led to the 
rethinking of my entire concentra-
tion choices thus far. Eventually, I 
gave myself an ultimatum: If biol-
ogy and Spanish were hanging off a 
cliff, which would I jump for?

The answer was too simple, too 

quick. I jumped for Spanish. And 
immediately after I jumped, I called 
my parents to let them know that, 
although I was still pursuing medi-
cal school, I was going to double 
major in BCN and Spanish and quit 
biology. They understood almost 
immediately, sensing my unhappi-
ness in biology in a way only parents 
can while giving me various reas-
surances. Directly after, I unasham-
edly cried for an hour straight. But 
they were happy tears, as I had final-
ly found an equal medium where I 
could still envision myself as a pedi-
atrician, yet be happy as an under-
graduate studying exactly what I 
wanted. I cannot wait to begin my 
journey as a sophomore in my new 
concentration, happy and interested 
for the first time in a long time.

My point is, follow Amy Poehler’s 

advice and do whatever you want 
and what makes you ultimately 
happy in life. Whether you’re a ris-
ing undergraduate or a new fresh-
man, never be afraid to pursue the 
important things in life. Enjoy your 
work, and you’ll create your own 
happy future.

MEGAN 
MITCHELL

S

ymbols of privilege: Canada 
Goose, Sperrys, J. Crew and 
Grey Goose. As a white male 

from an upper-
middle-class sub-
urb attending an 
elite 
academic 

institution, I am 
living proof. Though we often asso-
ciate privilege with a specific race, 
gender and socioeconomic status, 
there are some forms of privilege 
that aren’t as obvious as a silk shirt 
or, quite frankly, a penis.

Superficially, I represent the 

advantaged, but I also represent 
the disadvantaged 1.6 percent of 
the population that is openly gay 
or lesbian. Yes, I, a member of the 
“elite,” encounter abuse due to my 
homosexuality even in Ann Arbor. 
The University is ranked as one of 
the nation’s most liberal college 
institutions, yet I would argue that 
the student culture subconsciously 
remains homophobic, causing the 
persecution of gays on campus to 
appear somewhat invisible to the 
naked eye.

My first encounter with homo-

sexual persecution at the Univer-
sity occurred before I was even a 
student here, during the winter 
of my senior year of high school 
when I was admitted to Michigan. 
To celebrate the acceptance into 
my dream school, I asked a long-
time family friend, Adam — then 
a sophomore at the University — if 
I could come for the weekend and 
(sorry, Mom) party. Friday night 
I was ushered into an (unchaper-
oned!) apartment, given access to 
all the alcohol I wanted and thrown 
into a social scene unlike any lame 
high school party I had been to. 
Adam’s girlfriend and her friends 
came over, and after pre-gaming 
and getting acquainted with every-
body, we left for a house party. At 
the house, I was again ushered into 
a sweaty basement with a DJ, beer 

pong and party lights. I partied as 
any hot-shot senior in high school 
would, standing quietly by the beer 
pong table, pretending to be super 
focused on the game to avoid talk-
ing to people.

The guy I was standing next 

to at the table turned out to be an 
exchange student from China. I 
was interested in his experience as 
an exchange student, so we talked 
for a while. Not once did thoughts 
regarding his sexuality cross my 
mind; I was simply focused on 
the conversation we were having. 
I gave him my number for a rea-
son I can’t remember, maybe due 
to my innocence, maybe due to 
the impairment from the alcohol. 
Again, I didn’t think anything of it.

After the conversation ended, 

Adam replaced the exchange stu-
dent at the beer pong table. “Thank 
God, I was getting worried there,” 
he said in my ear. Confused, I 
questioned what he meant. “You 
guys were talking for a while,” he 
accused. I immediately understood.

Adam had caught me completely 

off guard. I’d had conversations 
with guys before, but had never 
experienced this kind of judg-
ment. After explaining to him that 
the guy was an exchange student, 
Adam then uttered, “You gave him 
your number,” in an attempt to 
prove my guilt.

We did not speak about the inci-

dent for the rest of the night, but as a 
result, I became nervous and avoid-
ed other conversations with guys, 
feeling my every move dissected by 
Adam’s gaze. The next time I vis-
ited Adam, I didn’t dare speak to 
other guys — only to groups with at 
least one female present.

That night I was introduced to a 

type of discrimination I had never 
experienced before. I was expect-
ing some kind of eventual abuse 
for my homosexuality at college, 
but not this soon and not by such 

a close friend. An action that I had 
found so innocent — a conversation 
about Asia and its culture with a 
sophomore student from China — 
was taboo just because that conver-
sation was with another man.

Throughout my freshman year 

at the University, I have been sub-
jected to other subtle forms of hate 
and discrimination due to my sexu-
ality. At my first frat party, I was 
told the more girls I hooked up with 
that night, the better chance I would 
have in being admitted to that fra-
ternity. My roommate continually 
questioned why I never brought a 
girl back to spend the night and pres-
sured me to do so. A night out was 
never complete unless you heard the 
casual insult “homo” or “faggot” at 
some party. Many of these offenders 
fail to realize that they are oppress-
ing an entire community when they 
make these “meaningless” comments 
they forget to have said less than five 
minutes later.

Homophobia has been internal-

ized by a large part of the University’s 
culture, and students subconsciously 
reveal it in ways that are still hurt-
ful. The conversation between Adam 
and me was so quick, so discreet, but 
it was one of the most meaningful 
to me. Acts of discrimination, such 
as Adam’s, are acts of microaggres-
sion, and they are less visible (and 
even perceived as nonexistent) to 
the student body. The oppression of 
the homosexual community often 
seems like an invisible one; preva-
lent, but conducted so accidentally or 
thoughtlessly that it becomes naked 
to the human eye. I am an upper 
middle-class white male, and there-
fore I am part of the advantaged. But 
I am also gay. Just because oppres-
sion is not visible to the majority of 
the population does not mean it is 
 

less significant.

T

his past summer, while most Michi-
gan students interned, worked, trav-
eled or took classes, I climbed out of 

a deep pit of emotional tur-
moil.

My 
inner 
equilibrium 

initially faltered at the 
end of last fall. As I 
struggled through my pre-med classes and 
extracurricular obligations, the anticipation 
of returning home for Winter Break stood as 
my only beacon of hope. Home life, though, 
came with its own stressors: a strained 
relationship with my brother, a lack of upkeep 
with my high school friendships and the 
dread of returning to Ann Arbor for another 
soul-crushing semester. While at home, my 
heart and soul began to spiral downward. 
I kept asking myself, if I didn’t like being at 
school and I didn’t like being at home, where 
did I like to be?

As winter semester began, I noticed a heavy 

feeling in my chest. I woke up each morning 
dreading going through my day. I spent hours 
lying in bed and staring at the ceiling, my 
mind blank and my heart heavy. I lost interest 
in the few enjoyable activities for which 
I had made time in my otherwise-tedious 
schedule. In the midst of feebly attempting 
to pull myself together, my support system 
disintegrated, due to an irreparable rift in my 
group of close friends. Whatever small hope I 
had held for a speedy recovery vanished.

As 
humans, 
we 
are 
evolutionarily 

programmed to adapt. I do not believe feeling 
permanently sad is possible; instead we 
eventually become numb to our pain so that 
we can go about our daily lives. By February, I 
had fallen into a routine that kept my feelings 
in check. Each day I would wake up, go to 
class, nap, go to meetings, finish homework, 
go to bed and repeat. The less thought 
required in completing my day, the better.

Knowing that I needed help, I signed up 

for a Counseling and Psychological Services 
appointment, but felt wary of attending 
weekly meetings devoted to discussing my 
sadness. As my appointments continued and 
the ground beneath me thawed, my heart and 
mind followed suit. By the time my parents 
came to pick me up in April, my full range of 
emotions had returned and my mother and 
father witnessed me collapse into a puddle 
of tears. Unlike Riley’s situation in “Inside 
Out,” though, my breakdown did not lead to 
an immediate, happy Pixar ending. Instead, 
that moment was the initial step down a long, 
winding road of eventual recovery.

The first half of my summer seemed to 

worsen my mental state. Rather than properly 
studying for the MCAT as I had intended, I 
would go to the library and my mind would 
start to race. Each day I became increasingly 
aware of my disinterest in pre-med life, 
my disengagement from the University 

community and my disconnection from the 
social circles all around me. Unable to ignore 
these thoughts, I postponed my MCAT to a 
later date and opted to work the rest of the 
summer as a camp counselor. For the first 
time in months I rediscovered something 
that I loved, and from that moment forward 
the true recovery process began.

Being a camp counselor did what months of 

therapy could not — it shifted my perspective 
through firsthand experience. Instead of 
waking up each day focusing on my own 
problems, I woke up thinking about how to 
best serve the needs of my campers. Instead 
of celebrating my own moments of success, I 
celebrated all the times my campers learned 
something new or made a new friend. The 
best part about camp was that all the usual 
pressures from life did not exist. I was free to 
be myself without worrying about doing well. 
Instead of trying to outshine one another, 
the entire camp community worked to shine 
brightly together. The moment everything 
clicked was when my campers and I went 
on an evening motorboat ride together on 
the lake. I’ll never forget our shrieks and 
squeals as the driver accelerated full speed 
across the water. We clung to each other over 
every sharp turn while wind whipped our 
hair and faces. I drank in the perfect evening 
air and a thought popped into my head: this 
was what it meant to be alive. Life was not 
about comparing myself to others or aiming 
for success purely for the sake of appearing 
successful. Life was about doing what I loved 
with people I loved.

For the rest of the summer, I turned this 

epiphany over in my mind. Were the concepts 
of enjoying life and achieving greatness 
mutually exclusive? Did the road to happiness 
necessitate giving up my dreams of becoming 
a doctor? After much thought, I became 
convinced that happiness and achievement 
are both possible, as long as I push myself 
for the right reasons. Medical school will be 
difficult, but I just need to remember that I’m 
going on this journey to help others, not to 
boost my own image.

As I begin my senior year, I worry that I will 

relapse into my previous stage of emptiness 
and depression. However, I strongly believe 
that if I surround myself with the right 
people and do things that make me truly 
happy, I will be able to push through the 
tough times and achieve my dreams without 
sacrificing my mental health. The University 
is a challenging environment that puts many 
students through tough mental roadblocks. 
This place has knocked me down numerous 
times, but I am determined to stand up once 
more and walk across the finish line with a 
smile on my face.

Chromik back in action
after year lost to injury

The redshirt junior 
learned a great deal 
during her time off 

the field

By LELAND MITCHINSON

Daily Sports Writer

To 
say 
that 
the 
2014 

Michigan field hockey season 
was 
a 
disappointment 
for 

Caroline Chromik would be an 
understatement.

After appearing in all 20 

of the Wolverines’ games her 
sophomore season, the redshirt 
junior 
defensive 
midfielder 

missed her entire junior year 
with a knee injury.

Now that she has a clean bill 

of health and has been awarded 
a redshirt year, she is ready to 
start helping her team on the 
field again.

“Being off for a year and then 

coming back, my first game I 
remember the pregame jitters 
were 
incredible,” 
Chromik 

said. “It made me realize that 
my opportunity to play here 
is something very valuable, 
and not everyone gets the 
chance, so it made me feel very 
fortunate and it put things in 
perspective.”

Though 
she 
started 
her 

career as an outright defender, 
Chromik will see more time at 
midfield this year. She wants to 
be able to anticipate plays and 

be a more aggressive player this 
season, though her role on the 
team is still mainly a defensive 
one.

“Sitting out for an entire 

year makes me realize my skills 
are rusty,” Chromik said. “But 
there are things I can control 
regardless of how good a field 
hockey player I am, like work 
ethic, so intercepting balls and 
being a really aggressive player 
is something I think I’ve become 
even more (since) sitting out.”

Chromik’s position on the 

field 
is 
not 

the 
only 

change in her 
contributions 
to the team. 
Voted captain 
by 
her 

teammates 
for 
the 
2014 

season, 
she 

matured 
into 

a more vocal 
leader on the 
team because her injury kept 
her from helping her teammates 
on the field.

“I think it’s always hard 

for anyone as a competitor in 
college to have such a serious 
injury and have to sit on the 
sidelines,” said Michigan coach 
Marcia Pankratz. “Their role 
abruptly changes from being 
an important player on the field 
to their role being someone 
who is now in a support role 
on the sideline and that’s really 

hard. … It gives you a different 
perspective and has made her 
a better player and a better 
leader.”

Added Chromik: “I had to be 

vocal even when I didn’t want 
to. I didn’t know that role, but 
I had to break out of my shell 
in that way. It’s good, because 
it has translated over onto the 
field now and I’m not afraid to 
speak what I think, and I think 
the team respects a lot of what I 
say now that I have experience 
both on and off the field.”

Chromik’s 

return 
adds 

one 
more 

key piece to 
an 
already 

strong 
defense. The 
unit — with 
senior Lauren 
Thomas and 
redshirt 
senior 
Mackenzie 

Ellis starting on the back 
line — looks to be one of the 
foundations of the team this 
season. 
However, 
Pankratz 

admits the season is still young 
and the team is in the process 
of finding its identity after five 
games.

As the season progresses, 

Chromik will be looking to take 
the lessons she learned from her 
time on the sidelines and make 
an impact on the field once 
again.

Junior guard Zak Irvin is set 

to undergo a back procedure 
at the University of Michigan 
Hospital and will miss six to 
eight weeks, the Michigan men’s 
basketball program announced 
Wednesday.

“We expect a 100 percent 

recovery for Zak after this 
procedure,” 
said 
Michigan 

basketball coach John Beilein in 
a statement. “We will not rush 
his return, but given Zak’s work 
habits and determined attitude 
we anticipate he will be back 
on the court and at full speed 
sometime near the beginning of 
our season.”

Irvin was a key piece in 

Michigan’s offense throughout 
the 2014-15 season, averaging 
14.3 points per game. He shared 
team MVP honors with senior 

guard Spike Albrecht.

The 
Wolverines 
return 
a 

dearth of experience this year 
after losing only senior forward 
Max Bielfeldt following the 2014-
15 campaign. Irvin, with two 
years of consistent play under his 
belt, again figures prominently 
into 
Michigan’s 
offensive 

outlook after leading the team in 
3-pointers last year and posting 
double-digit scoring figures 27 
times.

Harbaugh downplaying 
homecoming, wants win

By ZACH SHAW

Daily Sports Editor

To those who have experienced 

it, there can be something truly 
magical about Michigan Stadium 
on a fall Saturday. The band, food, 
cheering and 110,000 football 
fans create an event experience 
few can match.

But just days before the 

Michigan football team’s home 
opener against Oregon State, 
the Wolverines’ coaching staff 
has something else on its mind: 
winning.

“There’s a time and a place for 

nostalgia,” said Michigan tight 
ends coach Jay Harbaugh. “When 
you’re in the thick of it week to 
week, and you have meetings, 
practice, you don’t think about 
that kind of stuff. I don’t know if 
that’s hard to believe, but it really 
is true. … You just really want 
to play well, and the other stuff 
takes care of itself.”

As much as fans want to build 

up and romanticize the idea of 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 
— who quarterbacked the team 
from 1984 to 1986 — making his 
way down the tunnel for his first 
game back at Michigan Stadium, 
the coach refused to let nostalgia 
take priority when discussing his 
thoughts on the moment.

“(It’s the) same as the thoughts 

were last week — to win our next 
game,” the elder Harbaugh said 
Monday.

Though plenty of coverage 

has surrounded the head coach’s 
return to Michigan Stadium 
(SportsCenter will even broacast 

live from Ann Arbor to cover 
the homecoming), the coach 
downplayed the emotions and 
excitement of his return again in 
a teleconference Tuesday.

“It will be the thrill of 

preparing for a ballgame and 
watching the players compete,” 
Harbaugh said. “I know exactly 
what (I want) the emotions to be 
— the thrill of competition.” 

Michigan 
running 
backs 

coach Tyrone Wheatley — a star 
running back himself for the 
team from 1991 to 1994 — can 
empathize 
with 
Harbaugh’s 

sentiments about returning to the 
Big House. He hasn’t forgotten 
his time at Michigan Stadium, but 
knows his experience is different 
from those in the stands.

“You have to understand, when 

I was a player, I was running 
those stadium stairs,” Wheatley 
said in August. “So most of my 
memories (of Michigan Stadium) 
are of running those stairs 
thinking, ‘Oh god.’

“My focus (since I got here) 

has always been, ‘I’m here for a 
reason, let’s get to work.’ ”

Since the new coaching staff 

has arrived, much of that work 
has 
surrounded 
recruiting. 

Michigan has a top-10 recruiting 
class by most rankings, and 
will show at least a half-dozen 
recruits around Ann Arbor this 
weekend.

But as much fun as Michigan 

Stadium can be, the coaches 
know the best way to make a 
lasting impression.

“It’s exciting for the young 

guys to see 110,000 people fill the 
stadium, but I tell the guys that 
no matter how many fans are in 
the stadium, the dimensions of 
a football field never change,” 
said defensive backs coach Greg 
Jackson. “So when our guys go 
out on the field, we’re all excited 
to play, but we can’t get caught 
up in the fans in the stands. The 
dimensions of the football field 
stay the same, and when that 
whistle blows, we’ll be ready to 
play.”

Added 
Jim 
Harbaugh: 

“There’s a bad taste in our mouth 
when you lose a football game, 
and there’s only one mouthwash 
for that, and that is winning a 
football game, so that’s what 
we’re going to make darn sure on 
what we’re going to focus on.”

After dropping the back end 

of the Husky Nike Invitational 
in Seattle this past weekend, the 
Michigan women’s soccer team 
is looking to revive its winning 
ways.

The 

Wolverines 
(4-2) 
will 

face 
their 

first 
ranked 

opponent 
on 

Sunday 
in 

No. 13 Notre 
Dame, 
but 

before heading 
to South Bend, 
they have one 
team in their 
way. Michigan 
will host in-state competitor 
Central Michigan this Thursday 
night.

The Chippewas (1-2-1) are 

coming off a 2-0 win against 
Youngstown 
State, 
their 

first 
victory 

of the season.

Central 

Michigan 
goalie 
Zoie 
Reed 

posted 
her 

first 
career 

shutout in the 
match.

“She 
had 
a 
really 
good 

confidence-building 
performance,” 
Central 

Michigan coach Peter McGahey 

told Central Michigan’s athletic 
website.

To fully take control of 

the 
match, 
the 
Wolverines 

must handle the ball with 
finesse 
near 
the 
goal 
and 

exploit any free space given 
by Reed. Sophomore forward 
Taylor 
Timko 
continues 
to 

be an influential force up top, 
recording five goals already this 
year. But Timko is not the only 
contributing factor — 13 other 
players have tallied points in 
just six games.

Leading the Big Ten in shots 

per game with an average of 21.5, 
Michigan will look to continue 
its offensive dominance and 
exploit its opponent’s defense as 
it continues into the rest of its 
schedule.

The Wolverines completed 

a triumphant 3-0 victory at 
their last meeting with Central 
Michigan in 2014. To repeat this 
outcome, though, they’ll have 
to convert on their plethora 

of 
scoring 

opportunities.

“The 
main 

thing is just 
that 
we’ve 

got to finish 
our chances,” 
said Michigan 
coach 
Greg 

Ryan 
after 

Sunday’s 
loss 

against Washington. “This has 
been the thing that we’ve been 
trying to develop so far, because 
we’re getting enough chances to 
win games.”

Despite mistakes, Smith enjoys role as lead RB

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

From the time junior running 

back De’Veon Smith played in 
his first career game in 2013 to 
the beginning of fall camp for 
the Michigan football team this 
year, there always seemed to be 
someone in front of him.

Smith was a contender in the 

running back competition as 
soon as he set foot on campus as 
a freshman, but he carried seven 
times for just 12 yards, while then-
fifth-year senior Fitz Touissant 
rushed 14 times for 57 yards and 
two touchdowns. Touissant beat 
out Smith and then-freshman 
Derrick Green for the job, and 
Smith didn’t touch the ball again 
until November.

Then 
Touissant 
graduated, 

and Smith had another chance. 
This time, he made more of an 
impression, scoring twice on 
eight carries in the season opener. 
But Green rushed 15 times for 170 
yards, earning more touches in 
five of the first six games.

Then Green 

broke 
his 

collarbone Oct. 
4, ending his 
season. Smith 
had 
three 

games in the 
spotlight before 
Drake Johnson 
entered 
the 

fold, and Smith 
had to split time again.

“I really didn’t pay attention to 

any of that,” Smith said. “I was just 

trying my hardest to be No. 1.”

Still, three times, he had his 

chance. Three times, someone 
else took it.

This past spring, he came back 

under a new head coach, new 
offensive coordinator and new 
running backs coach, and the 

competition 
was 
tighter 

than 
ever 

before. 
Green 

was 
healthy, 

Johnson 
was 

on his way back 
and junior Ty 
Isaac 
became 

eligible 
after 

transferring 

from Southern California in 2014.

This time, Smith emerged as 

the victor.

Thursday brought his reward: 

In the season opener at Utah, 
Smith earned 17 carries to Isaac’s 
four and Green’s two. He again 
appeared as the No. 1 back on this 
week’s depth chart. Asked if he 
considers himself the No. 1 back, 
he finally got to simply say yes.

“I always go into the game 

expecting and hoping that I get 
a lot of carries,” Smith said. “Any 
running back in our room right 
now expects to get a lot of carries 
if they’re in the game. So it really 
wasn’t that big of a surprise for 
me. It was more of a humbling 
experience. First game, first time 
I’ve really started at Michigan, so 
I learned from my mistakes and 
just try to get better every week.”

Smith’s performance wasn’t 

his best, with just 2.8 yards per 

carry with a long run of seven 
yards. He broke a number of 
tackles, more than Green or Isaac, 
but struggled to find open space.

“Just reading the holes, I try to 

improve my vision,” Smith said. 
“The vision that I watched on 
film, that wasn’t really how I play 
from the point of seeing stuff. 
That’s something I’m trying to 
improve on this week.”

Smith only has one game in 

his career with more than the 17 
carries he had Thursday. In fact, 
Michigan’s running backs had just 
two such games all of last season.

If Smith can improve along 

with the rest of the team, he 
may be establishing himself as 
a workhorse going forward. He 
already has items on his list to 
improve upon.

“One of those plays (against 

Utah), I missed a hole that a bus 
could drive through,” Smith said. 
“That’s probably one of the bigger 
ones that stuck out to me, kind of 
got under my skin. And also the 
dropped pass that I had, that’s not 
characteristic of me at all. Just 
making sure I keep my eyes on 
the ball, tuck the ball in before I 
catch it.”

Smith said at one point in 

reviewing film, he asked running 
backs coach Tyrone Wheatley 
what the offense could change to 
have more success. Wheatley told 
him to stick with the game plan 
and eventually it would work.

Results came slowly in the 

opener, but in his third year, 
Smith may finally have a chance 
to make some improvements.

ETROIT — In the last room of a gallery at the Cranbrook Art Museum, a video of 
artist Nick Cave dancing in his signature soundsuits at various locations across 

Metro Detroit played on a loop out of a TV nestled in a far corner. I sat, transfixed, 
for a half hour on a bench in front of the TV, watching the flamboyant giants gyrate 
and hop into the air in front of abandoned houses adorned with paintings of unaban-
doned houses, under the crumbling domed ceiling of an art deco theater, in front of 
the anesthetic machinery of the Ford Assembly Plant in Wayne. There was something 
uncanny in the footage — in the way the faux fur shimmered against the gleaming 
white epoxy floor of the Ford plant, in the way the sound of thousands of rattling twigs 
swelled and then disappeared amid the chatter of market day on the city’s east side — 
something uncannily right. I felt that the suits had to have been made for Detroit: for 
its industrial ruins, urban blight and violently persistent vibrancy.

I was reminded of a description of Detroit from the novel “Middlesex” by author 

Jeffrey Eugenides, himself a native of the city:

“Planning is for the world’s great cities, for Paris, London, and Rome, for cities ded-

icated, at some level, to culture. Detroit, on the other hand, was an American city and 
therefore dedicated to money, and so design had given way to expediency.”

What Eugenides captures so masterfully here is the way in which the culture of a 

European world capital like Paris or London — a culture that drags in its wake a sense 
of historical continuity, of progress, of the linear progression of time; a culture meant 
to last — seems so violently out of place in a city like Detroit, which, money and indus-
try having left it, simply can’t afford the luxury of making a museum of itself.

In the Dark Ages, after the fall of the Roman Empire, medieval Italians built houses 

out of marble salvaged from Roman palaces and filled bathhouses in with dirt to make 
foundations for Christian churches. This same practice of salvage and reuse, which 
you might consider a type of recycling, is very much at play in Detroit today.

But in the Motor City — where the auto industry and the exuberant culture it 

helped fund are still fresh corpses — “recycling” doesn’t really capture the feel of 
what’s going on. It feels more like cannibalism.

But cannibalism has its culture, too. It has painting, sculpture, photography, the-

ater, religion, sports — and it has music.

The New Guys

In mid-August, I went to one of the newest sites of the city’s architectural autoph-

agy: Tires. Situated on a grassy corner about two blocks away from Martin Luther 
King High School on East Lafayette Street, Tires is a music venue and creative space 
whose name alludes to the old Lafayette Tires building, which now serves as the ven-
ue’s walls and roof. It has no signage and its massive garage doors are surrounded by 
a chain link fence. The venue has no website, but the performance schedule can be 
found on owner Mike Lapp’s Instagram account, scrawled in black ballpoint pen on a 
series of napkins and yellow legal pads.

I was there to watch a music video shoot for “K9” by Gosh Pith, a duo comprised 

of University alums Josh Smith and Josh Freed. The Joshes moved to Detroit in 2013 
and quickly became mainstays of the city’s underground arts scene, fitting seamlessly 
into a musical culture characterized by extensive cross-pollination of genres, ware-
house and loft parties, heavy bass, industrial and electronic elements and a generally 
bohemian outlook. Josh Smith sings and plays guitar, regularly uses “fuck” and “shit” 
with an infectious exuberance in the course of conversation, and has a large mane 
of blonde-dyed hair. Josh Freed is a producer, has shoulder-length brown hair and 
glasses and comes across as the more restrained half of the duo. Both refer to their 
music as “tunes.”

While I watched the Joshes direct their music video from the stage at Tires, I 

looked around the sizable crowd assembled for the shoot and saw a number of faces 
that unfalteringly appear at parties and concerts around the city. There was an editor 
from Daily Detroit, there was a DJ I saw almost get into a fist fight over performance 
time at the Russell Industrial Center and there were a number of photographers, 
directors, graphic designers, promoters and singers whom I hadn’t met but whose 
Soundcloud pages and personal websites invariably make their way across my Face-
book and Twitter feeds. I found that this was the way things usually go in Detroit as, 
in a phone interview a week later, Josh Smith explained how he and Freed became a 
part of the city’s music scene.

“Before we moved down (to the city), everybody went to the same parties and you 

just started to recognize familiar faces,” he said. “We kind of just started going to 
shows as much as we could, and we were making tunes simultaneously, and so it was 
just a natural progression, I suppose. If you go to every party for like two months, you 
can book a show just because you know everybody at the show that you just met.” 

And Gosh Pith’s reach and success as a band does, in fact, seem to have grown 

as quickly as Smith described. Since forming two years ago, they have released one 
six-track EP called “Windows,” have another project slated for release later this fall, 
and are already capable of booking shows across the country and in Canada. Our 
phone interview was conducted on the Kalamazoo leg of a tour that included stops in 
Toronto, Milwaukee, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Washington, D.C. and Philadelphia, all 
arranged by the Joshes themselves, who have no PR rep or management team.

Their sound, however, is very much grounded in and supported by the Detroit 

music scene.

“We want to make shit that’ll sound good on the sound systems that are around the 

city,” Smith said. “We want it to bang, we want the bass to hit hard, and everybody in 
Detroit is real as fuck so we make songs that are well-written, that are tangible and 
have some real emotion about them … (Detroit) informs our music because we go out 
and get fucked up every weekend, whether we’re playing or not we go support our 
friends, and it just informs our psyche.”

Even Gosh Pith’s cross-genre experimentation is made possible by the city’s unique 

musical landscape and tight-knit artist community.

“So many of the shows that go down in Detroit are the most broad-genre shows you 

would ever find, I think, because it’s kind of a small music community,” Freed said. “If 
you need someone to fill out a bill, it doesn’t matter if they fit that tightly with your 
band … It’s cool that our band could have any sound and fit in and do well in that space, 
but I think that we have done a pretty OK job of being able to play within the genre 
and kind of shift around.”

Creativity abounds in the city, and it feeds off of itself, producing an increasingly 

refined, professional sound with each new addition to the scene. But as large as its 
pool of cultural history and creative material might be, Detroit and its culture indus-
try are still suffering from fallout left behind by the collapse of the auto industry and 
the socioeconomic structure built on top of it. Traditional economic logic holds that 
growth requires capital, and, as Smith made very plain in our interview, “There’s not 
much money in Detroit.”

The Old Guys

While Gosh Pith’s hustle and talent is clearly a major component of their success, 

they’re also operating in an artistic community that is still essentially in its infancy, 
particularly in comparison with the music industries of larger cities like New York, 
Nashville, Atlanta or Los Angeles.

Since Motown Records relocated to the west coast in the early ‘70s, leaving a mas-

sive dent in the city’s profile as a culture industry, maybe a dozen Detroit artists — 
including J Dilla, Eminem, Jack and Meg White, Dej Loaf, Kid Rock, Big Sean and 
Danny Brown — have managed to achieve national recognition while maintaining 
their identification with the city as an essential part of their artistic personae. On the 
one hand, the diversity of those artists’ styles and portrayals of what it means to be a 
Detroiter reflects, on the one hand, the real diversity of a city whose popular image 
became, thanks to the ascendancy of the Big Three and Motown, a flattened carica-
ture of something akin to an assembly line spitting out Model Ts full of Stevie Wonder 
records. At the same time, however, the vast range of artists and styles operating in 
the city over the last 20 or 30 years also belies a fragmented cultural consciousness, a 
city riven by population decline and competition for scant resources.

Visiting Detroit’s underground music venues this past summer, however, “frag-

mented” would have been the last word on my mind. During our interview, the Joshes 
pointed me in the direction of a number of artists and bands that supported them 
when they first arrived in the city — the weirdest of which was, perhaps, Lord Scrum-
mage.

Alex Lauer and Conor Edwards, two members of this loosely organized experimen-

tal act, moved to Detroit and began making music in 2006, the beginning of Kwame 
Kilpatrick’s second term as mayor of the city and just a year after Ford and GM stocks 
were downgraded to junk status. It was also the year Detroit hosted both Super Bowl 
XL and a significant portion of the World Series. The Detroit Institute of Arts, Orches-
tra Hall and Fox Theatre were all undergoing major restorations. Detroit was making 
a bid to rebrand itself as a tourist destination at the same time as lifelong residents 
of the city decried the funneling of resources toward the Midtown and Downtown 
areas and away from communities suffering from crumbling infrastructure, crime 
and urban blight.

But, talking with Edwards and 

Lauer about the music scene in the 
city, I couldn’t pick up on any of 
that drama.

“It was a lot smaller then, I felt 

like,” Edwards said.

“In the beginning we were just 

like, ‘Hey, we’ve got a big loft here, 
let’s just have shows here.’ It was 
what we were doing in our parents’ 
basements and stuff before, so we 
just kept it going on a different 
level,” Lauer added.

They painted a picture of a 

group of friends and creative 
acquaintances, making music and 
art, essentially to entertain them-
selves, with little to no interest in 
expanding into an industry.

“It was never like a business 

thing. It was more just friends 
getting together and organizing 
events; it was never really a big 
moneymaker 
or 
anything. 

It 
was 
just 

doing 
things, 

and 
things 

started 
to 

come together 
naturally,” 
Edwards said. 

And 
that 

model of artis-
tic production 
seems to have 
held sway in 
Detroit for the 
better 
part 

of the last 10 
years, encour-
aging 
the 

development 
of 
talented 

semi-profes-
sional 
artists 

and 
quality, 

artist-run ven-
ues dedicated 
to good times 
and communi-
ty engagement. That ethos largely 
continues today — in nearly every 
interview I conducted for this 
piece, the “Detroit ethos” came up 
either explicitly or implicitly — but 
at some point over the last couple 
of years, things began to change.

“I’d say a couple of years ago is 

when I really noticed it,” Lauer 
said, “and that was when I met 
Kash and Martez (Claybren) and 
Takayla (Patterson), and they 
were putting these shows together 
that were like the Teklife people 
from Chicago, all of that footwork 
music and a bunch of local hip hop. 
And then the shows, it was all the 
genres in one show, and then those 
guys all started making music 
together.”

The KushMan

In the interest of full disclosure, 

I will say that Martez Claybren 
is a friend of mine. But he’s also a 
friend of just about every artist in 
Detroit, it would seem, including 
Ka$h Tha KushMan, the youngest 
member and most recent addition 
to the Bruiser Brigade — a Detroit 
rap collective directed by and sty-
listically organized around the 
music of Danny Brown. Brown 
is, I would argue, the best rapper 
Detroit has ever produced (with 
apologies to Eminem), and with-
out question the most innova-
tive, blending EDM, hip-hop and 
its British iteration, grime, into a 
menacingly surrealist product that 
fits the landscape of Detroit like 
a glove. And unlike other Detroit 
rappers like Big Sean or Eminem, 
Brown seems legitimately interest-

ed in producing a school of Detroit 
hip-hop that is both stylistically 
distinct and large enough and to 
assert itself as a legitimate chal-
lenge to the West Coast, Atlanta 
and East Coast varieties.

With rap wunderkind chops, 

Martez’s connections with the 
Chicago footwork scene and offi-
cial support from the elder Bruis-
ers, who started sneaking him into 
clubs around the city when he was 
14 years old, Ka$h seems poised to 
create a body of work as technical-
ly strong and stylistically innova-
tive as Danny Brown’s. I met him 
for an interview with his manager, 
Takayla Patterson, at a coffee shop 
on Grand River in Downtown 
Detroit. Ka$h arrived late with a 
tattoo-covered blonde girl who I 
was not introduced to and sat at 
a separate table, eating Chobani, 
for the entirety of the interview. 
He kissed Takayla on the fore-
head before sitting down and then 
explained that he was tired, hav-

ing been up all night tripping on 
acid. He was eating a muffin.

Detroit’s hip-hop scene has 

always been underground, essen-
tially, and would continue to be 
so were it not for J Dilla, Danny 
Brown and, to a lesser extent, 
Eminem. As Ka$h describes it, 
that scene is just now beginning 
to move past a schism created by 
Brown’s unconventional style and 
 

eventual rise to fame.

“I just know, back when Danny, 

when he was early starting, his 
voice is so weird that a lot of the 
cats in the city were like ‘We don’t 
really fuck with it. We don’t like it,’ 
” Ka$h said. “And later in the years 
when it evolved into the Bruiser 
Brigade, we separated ourselves 
because those people were trying 
to kick it with us all of the sudden.”

But Detroit’s rappers clearly 

have ambition — Brown, Dej Loaf, 
Big Sean and Eminem are all proof 
that the city has the ability to pro-
duce national stars. And as I talked 
to Ka$h, it became clear that he 
sees the city’s underground hip-
hop scene shooting to the forefront 
of its national counterpart.

“The artists start to realize 

that doing it by they self, they’re 
not gonna make it as far,” he said. 
“That’s why the city of Detroit 
doesn’t have as many big stars as 
Atlanta or California — it’s because 
there, even through their beefs, 
they still unify when it comes to 
the music. So I think Detroit is 
finally just seeing that and saying 
that they need to set aside all the 
B.S. and just make it work.”

And, while Ka$h can under-

stand why the city’s hip-hop scene 
has the history it does, he sees the 
younger generation of rappers — 
rappers who feel as home in the 
city’s hip-hop community as they 
do in the generic melting pot that 
characterizes the rest of its under-
ground music — are doing the 
work necessary to move toward a 
unified community of artists.

“Me, personally, I’m trying to 

kill that, because like, that was 
then, that was 10 years ago. We’re 
all pretty much in the same posi-
tion now, we need to get together.”

The (Business)man

After the Joshes told me there 

was no money in Detroit, they 
backpedaled a bit and said that I 
should look into Assemble Sound.

I googled Assemble and found 

an article in Crain’s Detroit about 
Garret Koehler, a 28-year-old 
entrepreneur from Chicago who 
moved to Detroit to work on an 
unsuccessful bid to bring the X 

Games to the 
city. 
After 

the bid fell 
through, 
he 
decided 

to 
stay 
in 

Detroit 
and 

start Assem-
ble, what he 
describes 
as 

“an organiz-
ing body for 
musicians,” 
which 
pro-

motes 
col-

laboration 
between the 
city’s under-
ground 
art-

ists and helps 
connect them 
with 
mon-

eymaking 
opportunities 
like 
licens-

ing contracts 
and 
institu-

tional grants. 

I e-mailed him and we set up a 
meeting at Assemble’s headquar-
ters — a repurposed German Prot-
estant church located a block away 
from the Detroit Central Station.

I arrived early, and Koehler, 

who looks and sounds like an 
enlightened frat bro, was making 
himself a chicken salad sandwich. 
He took me on a tour of the build-
ing, which is currently in the midst 
of massive renovations which 
is being funded by the artists 
involved in the project. He’s also 
seeking private investment and 
has entered the project into con-
sideration for a number of institu-
tional grants. The redesign plans 
call for three studios and a shared 
live room on the church’s second 
floor, with more studio space and 
a performance area on the ground 
floor.

Koehler’s office is coated with 

posters of Chance the Rapper, an 
artist who, he explained, serves as 
an inspiration for the entire proj-
ect.

“Inspired by what I saw in Chi-

cago with Chance and the Save-
Money crew, I got interested in the 
industry trends and sort of, I guess 
the change in power, if you will. 
The democratization of music and 
distribution, and what that meant 
for music,” he said.

And Koehler’s vision for how 

democratized music could look in 
Detroit is, indeed, inspiring.

Three years ago, Matt Cloutier, 

then a Music, Theatre & Dance 
freshman, stood in his dorm room 
in South Quad twirling a shoe 
horn, trying to imitate then drum 
major Jeffrey McMahon’s baton 
twirling techniques.

Today, Cloutier, a senior, stands 

in front of the entire band and, 
soon, the entire Big House, having 
graduated from his self-described 
“really long shoe horn” to a baton. 
He takes off his hat and begins to 
bend backward, initiating himself 
into the Michigan drum major 
position (pun intended), all eyes on 
him. He has arrived.

***

Cloutier began his musical 

journey 
in 
fifth-grade 
band, 

playing the trumpet. He continued 
playing throughout middle school 
and his time at Grosse Ile High 
School, where he joined the 
marching band, but never had a 
desire to be drum major.

“The drum major role here is a 

tad different than it was in my high 
school,” he said. “By a tad different, 
I mean a lot different. Here, it’s 
more of a performance role as 
opposed to a conducting role. I 
saw what the drum major did my 
freshman year, and I was like, ‘Oh 
wow that’s pretty awesome.’”

At the University, the drum 

major’s responsibilities have much 
more to do with what happens off 
the field than on it. During Band 
Week, which is actually between 
two and three weeks during 
the summer depending on one’s 
position, the drum major teaches 
the fundamentals of marching 
to the band for six to eight hours 
a day, first teaching all the new 
staff, then the new members, then 
returning members.

“I really enjoyed getting to learn 

about the teaching component,” 
he said. “It was really interesting 
over the summer; it’s so much 
more in-depth than I thought it 
would be. There’s so much more of 
a science to it.”

While Cloutier worked full 

time at AdAdapted, a technology 
platform, this summer, he went 
to Revelli Hall almost every day 
after work to practice his twirling 
and 
his 
teaching 
techniques. 

Former drum major Jeff Okala 
joined Cloutier to help with the 
transition, and past drum majors 

McMahon, David Hines Jr., Matt 
Cavanaugh and Gregg Whitmore 
all reached out to Cloutier with 
advice, too.

One of Cloutier’s favorite aspects 

of teaching is acting as a mediator 
between the staff and the band. As 
drum major, band members can 
approach him with any concerns 
they have, and Cloutier will work 
to find a solution.

“The staff’s not intimidating; 

they’re very nice, but it’s nice to 
have another student that’s a bit 
more approachable that they can 
come up to with any concerns 
or anything they have,” he said. 
“They can talk to me.”

The second part of Cloutier’s 

job is what he does on the field — 
the backbend, the twirling and the 
halftime performances.

“The twirling is fun because it’s 

the most creative,” he said. “You 
literally just make up whatever you 
want, and, as I’ve learned more 
twirling, it’s fun now because I 
can make stuff up more on the 
fly and just improvise my own 
little routine. That’s what I’ll end 
up doing during the halftime 
performances. There’s really not 
drill written out for me. Myself 
and the twirlers make up our own 
routines.

“During the twirling, I want 

to put some of my own personal 
flair into it and do some funny 
little dance moves and facial 
expressions,” 
Cloutier 
added. 

“It’s funny; a lot of the past drum 
majors have been really big, big 
guys, so that comes across. A lot 
of the stuff they were doing was 
really intense, but I’m a little 

smaller of a guy — a little bit more 
goofy of a personality — just being 
able to show that in the halftime 
shows.”

But, 
let’s 
talk 
backbend. 

According to Cloutier, the first 
drum major to do the backbend 
without his hat on was Matthew 
Pickus back in 1993. Since then, 
it was off and on (again, pun 
intended) 
with 
which 
drum 

majors would keep their hats on or 
take them off until the early 2000s, 
when taking off the hat became 
more standard.

“Within the last 10 years it’s 

kind of become an unwritten 
rule for the student section,” said 
Cloutier. “They want to see the hat 
off. Before that, most people did it 
with the hat on; that gives you an 
extra two and a half feet.”

And Cloutier is a people-pleaser 

— he’s going to do the backbend 
without the hat, because he knows 
you want to see it.

“I want to bring an insane 

amount of enthusiasm for the band, 
for Michigan and for everybody out 
there in the Big House, too,” he said.

***

Approximately three years ago, 

a freshman Matt Cloutier stood 
on a volleyball court in the IM 
building trying to imitate then-
drum major Jeffrey McMahon’s 
backbending skills. And for the 
first time, he succeeded.

Today, 
the 
senior 
Cloutier 

stands in front of the entire band 
and, on Saturday, The Big House. 
He takes off his hat and begins to 
bend backwards, all eyes on him 
as the top of his head reaches the 
ground. He has arrived.

them access to the people that you 
feel like you need to have access to 
to develop,” he said. “But what’s 
weird is that the whole industry is 
changing right now; it’s more about 
artist direct to consumer, direct to 
their audience, building that rela-
tionship, figuring out ways to mon-
etize your work to the extent that 
you want to. So we were less inter-
ested in, like, importing industry, 
because I don’t even know what 
that industry looks like anymore. 
More so, this is just a group of art-
ists that are just like ‘Let’s not be so 
siloed and fragmented, let’s try to 
be really intentional about building 
a more collaborative and coopera-
tive ethos in Detroit underground 
music.’”

He plans on developing edu-

cational programming for musi-
cians — like bringing copyright 

lawyers in to discuss the way roy-
alties function — and a residency 
program where artists exchange 
unlimited access to studio space 
for working as collaborators on 
other residents’ projects. A num-
ber of artists are already making 
use of Assemble Sound’s facilities 
— when I visited, one of the mem-
bers of Passalacqua, a hip-hop duo, 
was in the studio working with 
members of rock group Flint East-
wood on a track that was going to 
be licensed to ABC — and others, 
like Ka$h and Gosh Pith, certainly 
seemed interested in the arrange-
ment. But it’s hard to say what 
effect groups like Assemble might 
have on the city’s underground 
scene, and whether this coopera-
tive arrangement, inspired by the 
city’s cooperative ethos, could 
hold its own against traditional 
music industry model, as Koehler 
explained.

“Our idea was to have a cross-

genre, cross-generational space 
that’s all about championing cre-
ative cooperation and economic 
cooperation as a foundation for 
success. Not only for local musi-
cians, but also for the broader 
scene to represent,” he said. “So, 
we don’t know if, like, that actually 
is a true thing — if being collab-
orative and cooperative actually 
leads to success. It’s just a belief we 
have.”

Tires

I came back to Tires at the 

start of September to talk with 
its owner, Mike Lapp. In the two 
weeks after Gosh Pith’s music 
video shoot, the warehouse had 
been transformed into a film set, 
and a small tech crew was work-
ing on preparing for a scene from 
an adaptation of Ovid’s “Art of 
Love.” A few plaster busts were 
spread around the concrete floor, 
which was separated by 20-foot-
tall walls that had not been there 
at the time of the shoot.

Lapp, a native New Yorker, 

moved to Detroit from Brooklyn 
five years ago and opened Tires 
seven months ago, after pur-
chasing the building from his 

mechanic. He has since, with 
the help of his team, turned it 
into a professional venue that 
hosts concerts in a range of 
genres, serves as the set for film 
and music video shoots and, 
more generally, serves as a place 
where the city’s underground 
art community and business 
and political classes can meet 
and interact, on the artists’ 
terms.

Tires is, like much of Detroit, 

on the cusp between legitima-
cy and disaster, suspended in 
the tense middle ground cre-
ated when a city survives off of 
the remnants of its own recent 
past. It’s an infinitely interest-
ing moment — perhaps Ka$h’s 
ambition, blended with Assem-
ble Sound’s collaborative busi-
ness model and the cooperative 
ethos created by long-time art-
ist/residents like Lord Scrum-
mage could catapult Detroit’s 
art scene to the forefront of the 
nation’s producers of cultural 
capital. Or, maybe not. The 
ruins are standing all around 
— the price of failure is literally 
tangible, even in the paint peel-
ing off the side of Tires’ walls.

But it’s an infinitely beauti-

ful moment as well, and with 
pressure put in the right places, 
Detroit’s underground culture 
might become one of those cul-
tures built to last.

For Lapp, though, the city has 

to come to terms with itself and 
let its culture come out of its 
own shadow.

“Everywhere 
across 
the 

world there are these beautiful 
late night cultures that the cit-
ies can make money and tax and 
have a good time, and everyone 
respects it, so why do we have 
to hide in the shadows and be 
afraid?” he said. “There’s fund-
ing out there for artists, there’s 
funding out there for film, 
there’s funding out there for all 
of these things that are from 
9 to 5 p.m. and my question is, 
‘What about everyone else? 
What about all of the others?’”

Artscapade leads 
arts engagement

Arts at Michigan 
brings art offerings 

to students

 

By GRACE HAMILTON

Daily Arts Writer

“Our product is the student,” 

said Joe Levickas, interim direc-
tor of Arts at Michigan. For 
almost 16 years now, Arts at 
Michigan programs have worked 
on shaping, guiding and improv-
ing their product.

An ideal product — each ver-

sion different in appearance and 
mechanics — is the well-round-
ed student who is engaged and 
inspired by things outside of his 
or herself. If you’re reading this, 
you may very well be one of these 
special models.

“Art presents the opportu-

nity for alternative perspec-
tives. It gives people the power 
to connect things around them,” 
Levickas said.

Artscapade, an event hosted 

by Arts at Michigan each Sep-
tember, carefully engulfs stu-
dents with such opportunities.

Aside from Saturdays at the 

Big House, graduation or events 
like 2 Chainz and the New York 
Philharmonic at Hill Auditori-
um, there are few events on cam-
pus that draw in students and 
other Ann Arbor residents by the 
thousands.

Artscapade has and contin-

ues to comfortably fit more than 
3,000 students in the University 
of Michigan Museum of Mod-
ern Art every year since 1999. 
Inspired by Escapade, a similar 
event for student organizations 
held at the Michigan Union, the 
goal of the program is to intro-
duce new freshman and other 
students to artistic groups on 
campus, and give them an oppor-
tunity to explore the ways other 
Michigan students are partici-
pating in the arts.

This year’s Artscapade, which 

took place Friday, Sept. 4, kicked 
off with a performance by per-
cussion group Groove, as well 
as WBCN DJs outside of the 
museum, where a picnic feeding 
thousands took place in front of 
Angell Hall.

I stopped by this year to check 

it out, the second time since I 
attended the event two years ago 
as a freshman. It was clear from 
the wandering and offensively 
bright blobs of yellow T-shirted 
friends that many of these stu-
dents, if not most of them, were 
also freshman.

The event is a sensory explo-

sion and tactile adventure. In 
addition to having the chance 
to view the impressive — and 
arguably underexplored — exhi-

bitions on display, there is live 
music, dance, film screenings, 
games and opportunities to win 
prizes from nearby businesses.

“Having thousands of people 

who are all suddenly saying, 
‘Oh let’s go to the museum,’ and 
for other students to be able to 
showcase their own work just 
creates a totally different atmo-
sphere,” Levickas said.

“The museum is packed and 

still everyone here is so involved, 
either watching the perform-
ers or doing the activities set 
up,” said Art & Design junior 
Elise Haadsma, a member of the 
dance group Cadence, said. “It’s 
so fun because to perform in this 
environment because the audi-
ence is so enthusiastic.”

Ann Arbor has long been 

recognized for its vibrant artis-
tic culture, one that is largely 
fostered by the presence of the 
University and its students. 
With K-12 arts education slip-
ping over the course of the last 
three decades — due to budget 
cuts and an increased focus on 
testing, among other things — 
the high level of engagement 
between student organizations 
and the arts is a big thumbs-up.

That being said, the number 

of students who haven’t made it 
to UMMA by their senior year 
(or any arts event on campus for 
that matter) is probably higher 
than it should be. I asked Levick-
as about what the major barriers 
to high engagement were.

“One of the big things that 

seems to be insurmountable is 
time — people talk about not 
having any time. But another 
major thing people say is that 
they can’t afford it or ‘I don’t 
know anything about it,’ so a 
number of the things that we do 
are meant to try and get around 
those barriers,” Levickas said. 
One of the finest examples of 
this mission in practice is the 
Passport to the Arts initiative. 
Students can pick up a Passport 

voucher every two weeks and 
attend one of the events listed 
with a free or discounted ticket.

Levickas, who has been with 

Arts at Michigan for six years 
and has a background in paint-
ing and arts education, empha-
sized that Artscapade is also 
an important part of solving 
these problems and the pro-
gram’s greater mission. “We 
want to connect undergraduate 
students to the arts; music, the-
ater, film dance, literary arts, 
whatever it may be,” Levickas 
said. “Our goal is to try and 
be that connective tissue, find-
ing ways for them to build their 
identities or to learn something 
new about what’s happening on 
campus.”

Measuring the effectiveness 

of this connection can be dif-
ficult. One of the things that 
Arts at Michigan does is survey 
everyone who uses a voucher. 
Questions 
are 
intentionally 

open-ended, giving way to some 
interesting results.

“We ask questions like, ‘Have 

you ever been to an event like 
this?’ And that can lead to many 
answers. But whatever it is, a 
third are saying they’ve never 
been to an event like that one, 
and literally 99.5 percent fol-
low that by saying they would 
go to an event like that again,” 
Levickas said.

With that idea in mind, the 

most important thing to know 
is that participation, or just 
observation, does not mean 
expertise. You need not under-
stand the art of film, contem-
porary painting, or be writing 
a dissertation on modern dance 
in order to criticize it, enjoy it, 
laugh at it or cry. Not only are 
these valid responses, they’re 
good ones.

And someone wants to hear 

about it. Don’t deprive them of 
your voice, and certainly don’t 
deprive yourself of realizing you 
have one.

AACT revives classic 
Addams characters

By BAILEY KADIAN

Daily Arts Writer

The Ann Arbor Civic Theatre, 

an organization dripping in histo-
ry and opportunity since 1929, will 
open its next 
feature: 
The 

Addams 
Fam-

ily, the musical 
comedy 
based 

on 
the 
well-

known Charles 
Addams 
car-

toons. 

Written 

by 
Marshall 

Brickman and 
Rick 
Elice, 

with 
music 

and lyrics by 
Andrew Lippa, 
“The Addams 
Family” 
depicts the story created from 
Addams’s 
original 
cartoons, 

rather than from the numerous 
adaptations of TV series and 
film. The simplicity of his work 
leaves room for creativity while 
adapting these iconic figures to 
the stage.

“We stay true to the origi-

nal cartoon characters, but I 
really think people will forget 
halfway through the show that 
these characters are supposed 
to be weird.,” director Trish 
Fountain said.

Fountain described the story 

as relatable and she stressed 
that 
the 
characters 
should 

“come off as accessible, while 
also being fun.”

The original directors and 

designers 
of 
the 
Broadway 

musical, 
Phelim 
McDermott 

and Julian Crouch, described 
Addams’s reality as different 
and inverted. While bringing 
these cartoons to the stage, they 
hoped to properly represent the 
macabre world of the Addams 

cartoons, while bringing new 
elements to the Addams’s work.

There is a challenge with 

a work so well known to stay 
loyal to an audience’s expecta-
tions, but designers must also 
focus on taking risks in how 
the humor of the piece is rep-
resented, as well as the charac-
ters within it. This production 
should honor the simplicity of 
the Addams cartoons, without 

falling into the clichéd versions 
of these familiar characters.

“Because this is a modern ver-

sion of cartoons that were created 
decades ago, we wanted to freshen 
up the look a bit,” Fountain said, 
while explaining the approach to 
designing the show. These mod-
ern elements are incorporated 
into the stage design, as well as 
the costume, hair and make-up 
design.

The original Broadway pro-

duction of “The Addams Fam-
ily” opened in April 2010 at the 
Lunt-Fontanne Theatre in New 
York City, and closed in Decem-
ber of 2011 after 35 previews and 
722 performances. The produc-
tion won a Drama Desk Award 
for Outstanding Set Design and 
won multiple audiences awards 
including Broadway.com’s Favor-
ite New Broadway Musical.

The musical tells the story of 

Wednesday Addams, who has 
fallen in love with Lucas Beinek. 
Lucas and his “normal” family are 

invited to a dinner at the Addams’s 
mansion in Central Park. Wednes-
day’s father, Gomez, is put into 
further turmoil towards this visit 
when his daughter chooses to 
share the news of her recent love 
with him, begging him not to tell 
her mother. Gomez finds himself 
in a conflict between honoring his 
daughter’s request and keeping 
secrets from his wife Morticia, 
which is something he’s never 
done. The ensuing chaos is comi-
cal and wild, calling for actors 
that can portray distinct person-
alities and sell an audience on the 
story of a family of misfits as they 
attempt to interact with those 
considered “normal.”

“When casting a musical, 

vocal range and the color of the 
voice are just as important as 
the look and characterization 
of an actor,” Fountain said. “We 
were incredibly lucky to find 
people that fit each character 
really well, and complimented 
the other actors in the show.”

University of Michigan stu-

dents and recent alumni are 
involved in both the cast and 

production of this show, as 
A2CT aims to include as much 
of the Ann Arbor community as 
possible in their productions. 
And the humor and enjoyment 
of Addams’s original cartoons 
has no doubt rubbed off on 
A2CT’s team.

“I want audiences to know 

how much fun we’ve had creat-
ing this production, and I think 
that will show in each perfor-
mance,” Fountain said.

“I want 

audiences to 

know how much 
fun we’ve had.”
