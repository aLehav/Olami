ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-NINE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Statement made
Michigan runs away from its 
in-state rival, 44-10, sending 
Michigan State into further 
despair in a disastrous year.

More than 100 Ann Arbor 
residents and students marched 
Sunday to raise awareness 
about 
affordable 
housing 
issues in the city. Gathering 
initially in Liberty Plaza, many 
members of the group spoke 
about their personal housing 
experiences and urged others 
to contact their representatives 
about housing issues.
According to the Washtenaw 
General Defense Committee, 
rent went up 15 percent in the 
last year alone in some areas of 
the city. Two different reports 
from this August confirmed 
Ann 
Arbor’s 
skyrocketing 
rents, with a year-over-year 
rent increase of 15.9 percent. 
The committee also said about 
80,000 individuals commute 
to Ann Arbor as there isn’t 
affordable 
housing 
closer 
to their point of work. The 
University of Michigan also 

has a large effect on this issue, 
as every year the number 
of students trying to find 
off-campus 
housing 
grows, 
according to the Washtenaw 
General Defense Committee. 
Several 
different 
social 
activism groups participated 
in the march. The Washtenaw 
General Defense Committee, 
Interfaith 
Council 
for 
Peace 
& 
Justice, 
Journey 
of Faith Christian Church, 
Poor People’s Campaign of 
Washtenaw County and Huron 
Valley Democratic Socialists of 
America all had representatives 
present. Rackham student Meg 
Berkobien, 
co-chair 
of 
the 
Huron Valley DSA, said housing 
affordability is a systemic issue 
that needs to be addressed.
“This is a systemic problem, 
and 
so 
it 
takes 
systemic 
answers, 
right. 
Coming 
together, that’s exactly what 
this is about.

Panelists voice concerns over hiring 
practices in A/PIA studies program

The University of Michigan 
Veteran and Military Services 
organized and hosted a Women 
in the Military panel Friday. The 
six panelists, all female veterans, 
spoke as part of the University 
Veteran’s Week to an audience of 
about 25 students, veterans and 
other members of the Ann Arbor 
community. 
Jan Malaikal, a veteran who 
served in the U.S. Army for 20 
years, moderated the panel. She 
began by asking the panelists to 
introduce themselves, give a brief 
overview of their service and 
talk about why they joined the 
military. 
Jennifer Lamb, who served 
as a mortar ballistic computer 
weapons specialist and a supply 
officer for the U.S. Marine Corps, 
talked about how she was the first 
woman in history to cross the 
Arctic Circle in a rigid rubber raft, 
and only the third woman ever to 
be trained in her profession. She 
said she joined the military to 
fund her college education. 
“I joined because I was poor,” 
she said. “The military does help 
pay for college. So, I was in the 
Marine Corps reserves so I 
could finish my college.”

Former U-M professor Scott Kurashige and lecturer Emily Lawsin discuss corrupt structural practices at the University regarding administrative and sexual misconduct 
policies at the #UMICHIsComplicit Town Hall at Weill Hall Sunday evening.

On Friday morning, LSA 
freshman Adam Grimes visited 
the University of Michigan 
Counseling and Psychological 
Services website to make an 
appointment with a campus 
counselor. His wait time was 
13 days. On that same day, LSA 
sophomore Andrew Goldman 
received a wait time of 23 days.
“That means that if right now 
you felt as though you needed 
to talk to someone here at this 
university regarding a mental 
health issue or some other issue 
you have — you want to go to 
talk to someone you can trust 
to give you good advice — you 
have to wait all the way until 
mid-December, 
right 
around 
finals,” Goldman said. “That’s 
absolutely unacceptable for any 
student to have to wait that 
long.”
Mental health and student 
input 
were 
major 
agendas 
on policy platforms at the 
LSA 
Student 
Government 
representative 
candidates’ 
forum on Friday. According to 
LSA senior Lorraine Furtado, 
LSA SG elections director, the 
13 candidates are currently 
uncontested.

University of Michigan students, 
faculty and community members 
discussed 
discrimination 
and 
“sham” investigations at the “UM: 
Corruption, Complicity, Coverups” 
town hall in Weill Hall Sunday night. 
The event was hosted by UMich is 
Complicit: a movement dedicated 
to combating discriminatory hiring 
practices and sexual misconduct 
policies at the University.

The 
panel 
featured 
Scott 
Kurashige, former director of the 
Asian/Pacific Islander American 
Studies 
Program 
and 
tenured 
professor at U-M, and his partner 
Emily Lawsin, a lecturer in the 
departments of Women’s Studies 
and American Culture. They filed 
a discrimination lawsuit against 
the University under the Michigan 
Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act in 
December 2016. 
Kurashige is now a professor 
at the University of Washington. 

He said he was removed from his 
position as the director of the A/
PIA Studies Program, and while his 
tenure prevented him from being 
fired, the University pressured him 
to quit.
“While I was here, I was an 
advocate for students who had faced 
different types of discrimination 
or assault,” Kurashige said. “In 
response, 
I 
faced 
retaliation, 
harassment. In essence, I was forced 
to quit under threats and harassment 
by administrators at this University.”

Lawsin 
was 
up 
for 
her 
employment review in 2017 — 
every few years, lecturers undergo 
standard performance reviews. She 
said she expected her contract to be 
renewed, as she had been working at 
the University since 2000. However, 
both departments she works in 
decided not to renew her contract. 
She then submitted a rebuttal 
letter 
to 
the 
LSA 
Executive 
Committee. 

Annual IASA show highlights 
cultural dances at Michigan Theater

‘Kahaani’ features 240 student performers from hip hop to bhangra

On Friday night, the Indian 
American Student Association put 
on its annual cultural dance show 
at the Michigan Theater. This 
year’s show, titled “Kahaani: The 
Tale of Our Time,” featured more 
than 250 participants performing 
for a sold-out audience. The show 
featured 10 dances showcasing 
a variety of styles, ranging from 
traditional Bhangra and South 
Indian dances, to Bollywood and 
hip hop. 
“Kahaani,” 
which 
means 
“story,” was chosen as the show’s 

theme by the show coordinators 
and 
show 
core 
team. 
LSA 
senior Karthik Pittala, IASA 
co-president, talked about the 
reasons behind the theme.
“They wanted to sort of make 
it like a story, so we have ups 
and downs in terms of tempo 
or musicality trying to make it 
dynamic as much as possible,” 
Pittala said. “I think it’s just 
something that resonated with all 
of us.”
As co-presidents, Pittala and 
LSA senior Sanjna Chokshi were 
in charge of communicating with 
the leadership team and the rest 
of the IASA members, as well as 
engaging with other organizations 

on campus such as the United 
Asian American Organizations 
and Michigan Sahānā. 
“We’re like the groundwork, 
and then everyone else can build 
their ideas based on some of our 
suggestions,” Pittala said.
IASA also partners with a 
charity each year to help raise 
money and promote their cause. 
This year’s community service 
partner was Sakhi for South 
Asian Women, a New York-based 
charity that unites “survivors, 
communities, and institutions to 
eradicate gender-based violence 
and form healthy communities.”
After the dancers of the 
“Village” 
performance 
left 

the stage in their traditional 
costumes, taking with them the 
aviator sunglasses they put on in 
the middle of the dance, the show 
took a brief pause from the high 
energy and humor of the dances to 
play a video about Sakhi’s mission 
and impact. 
As one of the community 
service chairs for IASA, LSA 
sophomore Jhanvi Garg was 
involved with picking out the 
charity for the season and creating 
events throughout the year that 
align with Sakhi’s values.

The departments agreed to 
review her case again two years 
later. Her next review is expected at 
the end of this semester. 
She said her treatment at the 
University is noticeably different 
from that of her white, male 
colleagues. Lawsin explained how 
when she suggested a resolution 
to the Department of Women’s 
Studies in 2015, she was dismissed 
and she felt like her criticism of 
the University was followed up by 
disciplinary action against her. 
“The way I was treated for that 
time period was in stark contrast 
with the treatment of a white, male 
lecturer in my department who was 
found of having sexual misconduct 
toward a student several years 
prior,” Lawsin said. “He was given 
a disciplinary warning but this was 
never shared with other faculty 
or his review committee, whereas 
my resolution to support survivors 
somehow found its place in my 
review file to show that I was a 
troublemaker.”

Lawsin continued, saying they 
chose to file a lawsuit to not only 
stand up for themselves, but to stand 
up for other A/PIA students, faculty 
and all other community members 
who might be discriminated against 
by the University. 
“That’s part of the reason why 
we decided to file a lawsuit in 
December of 2016,” Lawsin said. 
“They threatened not to allow me 
to come back to teach. Teaching 
has been my love and we felt that if 
they could do that to me and force 
my partner (Kurashige) out, what 
would they do to others who are 
even more vulnerable?”
Kurashige 
discussed 
the 
challenges of filing a lawsuit 
against a major institution like the 
University. 
“It’s not easy to be a whistleblower 
in this society, right?” Kurashige 
said. “When you challenge people 
in power, they can come down on 
you with the force of institutional 
power, they can try to shame you 
to the public … there are all types of 
things set up to keep people silent.”
Kurashige said the University 
attempted to discriminate against 
he and Lawsin when their newborn 

child required heart surgery. He 
said their request for modified 
duty, where workers are entitled to 
alternate assignments while they 
or a family member is recovering 
from medical illness or injury, was 
intentionally delayed six weeks. 
“Our child is five years old now, 
she was born in the spring of 2014,” 
Kurashige said. “She had a hole in 
her heart and required open heart 
surgery … while this was happening, 
we were both putting in for what’s 
called modified duty, which is the 
closest thing the University has 
to maternity or paternity leave, 
and what we found through the 
emails we got in this lawsuit is that 
the Dean’s office was deliberately 
delaying processing that while we 
were in this vulnerable state and 
concerned about our child.”
In a message to The Daily, 
University 
spokeswoman 
Kim 
Broekhuizen said the University 
encourages anyone who feels they 
have been discriminated against 
to report it and go through with an 
investigation.
“The University of Michigan 
has a robust and well-established 
complaint 
and 
investigation 
process 
for 
handling 
claims 
of discrimination and we are 
confident that process is effective,” 
Broekhuizen wrote. “All persons 
who believe they have been 
subject to discrimination and 
harassment are encouraged to 
use the university processes for 
investigating 
their 
complaints. 
It is against university policy 
and unlawful to retaliate against 
someone for filing a complaint or 
participating in the investigation 
process.”
Kurashige then said though the 
Office of Institutional Equity is 
supposed to conduct investigations 
independently, OIE’s former senior 
director admitted under cross 
examination for their lawsuit that 
they often send information to 
lawyers at the Office of the Vice 
President and General Counsel.
“Anything that gets told to 
OIE, whether you’re a civil rights 
complainant, sexual misconduct 
complainant 
or 
a 
survivor, 
anything 
you 
tell 
them 
can 
immediately get transmitted to 
University lawyers because they 
are the ones hired to prepare a 

defense for the University in case 
there is a civil lawsuit, which is 
absolutely astonishing that there 
is absolutely no independence or 
confidentiality,” Kurashige said. 
Panelist Anna Dang, LSA junior 
and a representative for the A/
PIA Studies Program on the panel, 
said a previous director of A/PIA 
Studies hired by the University 
was 
unqualified 
to 
lead 
the 
program and serves an example 
of discriminatory hiring practices. 
Dang later clarified to The Daily 
the former director that she was 
referring to was John Kuwada, 
whom the University hired to be 
the new director for the 2018-19 
school year.
“An example is hiring someone to 
be the director of the A/PIA Studies 
Program just because they’re Asian 
and a biology professor,” Dang 
said. “This disrespects the A/PIA 
identity by implying that being 
part of this identity means that 
you are politicized and can head 
a department. And it definitely 
disrespects the A/PIA Studies 
Program because it is implying that 
we only have these skills because we 
identify as A/PIA. It’s a discerning 
model that the administration is 
hiring like this.”
LSA junior Josiah Walker, a 
panelist, echoed what Dang said 
and cited Pamela Heatlie, the 
former Title IX coordinator, as an 
example of poor hiring practices. 
OIE’s investigations faced intense 
criticism under Heatlie’s leadership.
“There definitely is a disconnect 
between 
what 
administrators 
say happens and what actually 
happens,” Walker said. 
Dang concluded by emphasizing 
the importance of student activism 
against 
discrimination 
at 
the 
University. She said students hold 
the most power in representing A/
PIA. 
“As students you have the power 
to enroll in A/PIA courses, you can 
decline the ethnic studies minors, 
you can ask why there aren’t majors 
in a lot of these programs, you can 
talk to our professors and connect 
with them,” Dang said. “And, 
you know, admin can’t really fire 
students. We hold an extremely 
distinctive 
place 
in 
making 
demands at this University if we 
can stand together.”

A/PIA
From Page 1A


As I walk through campus, 
surrounded by people who look 
nothing like me, I can’t help 
but feel like I don’t belong. 
I try not to compare myself 
to anyone but it seems like 
everyone around me has their 
lives figured out, their friend 
groups established and their 
futures secured. And though 
these feelings may not mirror 
the truth, they still linger in 
my mind. 
In 
order 
to 
escape 
the 
confinements of my thoughts, 
I plug in my headphones and 

launch the Apple Music app. 
Once I hit play, and turn the 
sound on, the negative thoughts 
turn off and my worries begin 
to dissipate.
The hums of Kid Cudi soothe 
my mind like honey to a sore 
throat and his intergalactic 
beats teleport me to another 
dimension. 
The guitars of Santana place 
me on a tropical beach with a 
beaming sun that defrosts my 
pina colada to perfection.
The vocals of Eartha Kitt 
drive me to a black and white 
French film from the 1950s 
where everything happens in 
fast-motion and there is no 
dialogue. 
The ethereal instrumentals 

of Jhene Aiko elevate me to 
the clouds while her lyricism 
brings me back down to earth 
and humble me. 
The familiarity of Nancy 
Ajram’s voice takes me back 
to Sunday nights at my Tata’s 
house 
watching 
Arabic 
television, drinking shai and 
eating so much baklava that my 
teeth hurt. 
My freshman year of college 
has me feeling lost, but music 
helps navigate my journey. 
Music has the power to teleport 
me anywhere I can imagine, 
and though the song will soon 
end and I will be awakened 
to my reality, it’s still nice to 
escape from the struggle every 
now and then. 

Although 
the 
dean 
only 
allows the domestic students to 
swap sections,

That’s not discrimination. 
That’s just a policy.

Although 
a 
professor’s 
favorites all happen to be white

and she only lets them speak,

She’s not racist. That’s just a 
coincidence.

Although your class points 
at a random Asian figure in a 
drawing and asks

“Is that you?”

They’re not racist. They’re 
just dumb.

Although someone who sits 
next to you looks down and 
throws handouts,

She’s not racist. She’s just 
rude to everyone.

Although a shopper cringes 
and 
complains 
about 
you 
speaking Korean in public,

She’s not racist. She’s just 
distracted.

Although a police officer 

enters your room and speaks to 
you in condescending language,

She’s not racist. That’s just 
her job.
 
That’s just your paranoia. 
That’s how it works. That’s how 
they are.

When 
something 
offends 
you, it’s just a coincidence.

Once you point it out, you are 
the racist.

So please, remain silent. It’s 
just you.

Not home for the holidays

 Shoes and Ink

Tunes that teleport
Paranoia

It’s that time of year again: the 
period after Halloween and the 
beginning of November where 
individuals start playing holiday 
music 
like 
Mariah 
Carey’s 
“All I Want for Christmas is 
You,” 
completely 
surpassing 
Thanksgiving. 
And 
although 
Thanksgiving is not something 
that everyone celebrates due to 
the literal unacknowledgement 
of a Native American genocide 
carried out by English settlers, 
it is a time where some students 

gear up to go home and spend 
time with their loved ones. 
Anticipating the home cooked 
meals is one of the best parts 
of the days leading up to 
Thanksgiving break; students 
book their plane or bus tickets 
months in advance to make sure 
that they are able to be home 
and get that much needed break. 
Unfortunately, some tend to 
forget that not everyone is able 
to go back to a family home and 
thus have to spend the holidays 
alone. 
Some do not want to go 
home to their families because 
the holidays may bring up bad 

memories, or they are not on 
good terms with their families. 
Surely we have seen the tweets 
where 
common 
scenarios 
play out during this time of 
year: There is an uncle that 
sits at the dinner table during 
Thanksgiving, says something 
homophobic and you have to 
sit there in silence to protect 
yourself because it can be 
dangerous to speak up. These 
scenarios 
actually 
happen, 
making some not want to go see 
their families over the holidays 
because they feel that their life 
could be in jeopardy if they do 
so because of the identities they 

hold. Normalizing the choice to 
not go home to avoid situations 
such as the one mentioned will 
make the Holidays much more 
enjoyable for everyone; still 
post pictures of your delicious 
plates on social media, but keep 
in mind that not everyone has 
this 
privilege. 
Furthermore, 
financial 
constraints 
can 
prevent students from traveling 
to see their loved ones.
It is okay to not want to go 
home for the holidays. It is not 
strange, but instead it is a choice 
one has to make when thinking 
about their security and mental 
health because the holidays are 

not enjoyable for everyone. Here 
are some things to remember 
when deciding if being home 
during this season is the best 
option for you: 
It is your choice whether or 
not to spend the holidays with 
your family. 
If you are able to choose an 
alternative place to spend time 
with your family, do so: Family 
situations can be complicated, 
and thus planning out different 
places to congregate can relieve 
some stress. 
Be honest with your family 
about your presence during this 
time. If they are unable to accept 

that you are on the fence about 
coming home, consider the kind 
of relationship you would want 
to have with them in the future. 
Don’t feel guilty for feeling 
the way you feel. It is valid, it is 
normal and if family members 
respond with disappointment 
about 
your 
absence, 
your 
decision is still valid.
Make the decision, and be 
confident in it. Know that you 
did the right thing. 
Start 
your 
own 
holiday 
tradition! Make it what you want 
it to be to make the holidays 
more enjoyable. 

These pieces are from my 
“Stationery 
At 
the 
Moulin 
Rouge” series. I created them in 

a study of Henri de Toulouse-
Lautrec, a French artist from 
the 1890’s who immortalized 
his favorite hangout, the Moulin 
Rouge, 
in 
his 
lithographic 
advertisements. I decided to 
create my own ads advertising 

my school supplies from my 
school days in India— supplies 
that were, and still are, very 
beloved to me—using similar 
imagery and colors to his work. 
Creating these ads was a way for 
me to pay tribute to the objects 

that helped foster my passion 
for drawing in the first place—
the numerous ink and pencil 
doodles that filled my school 
notebooks made my art what it 
is today.

A break from reality

Somedays
Being Black in America 
feels like a never-ending 
game of musical chairs
The DJ’s favorite song is 
“meritocracy”
You only see yourself and 
other Black people dancing
Like 
modern-day 
minstrels around
Chairs like 
Graduate programs
White-collar jobs
A living wage
Chairs that were never 
made for you
Chairs that were made to 
keep you dancing

Somedays
Being Black in America 
feels like a rigged game of 
monopoly
You and your brother and 
your cousin and your best 
friend 
Keep landing on the space 
marked “Go to Jail”
Keep 
drawing 
cards 
marked “Go to Jail”
Keep 
seeing 
whole 
neighborhoods marked “Go 
to Jail”
And sometimes, even that 
is a privilege because,

Somedays
Being Black in America 
feels like a bad game of 

charades
You comply
You put your hands up
You sit in your house
They guess “threat”
They guess “violent”
They guess “weapon”

Somedays
Being Black in America 
feels like chess, not checkers
Grandma 
tells 
your 
brother “never fuck a white 
woman”
Momma cuts off your 
sister’s dreads so she can 
“look professional enough to 
get a job”
And you are tired of 
navigating a PWI
Tired of knowing that 
everything you say and do is 
seen as a representation of 
all Black people

You are tired of the DJ 
playing “meritocracy”
You are tired of monopoly 
boards filled with “Go to 
Jail” spaces
You are tired of the police 
guessing incorrectly
You are tired of playing 
chess with white people

But most of all 

Yo are tired of being 
played

Playing 
games

Beware the brunch-industrial complex

KAAVYA RAMACHANDHRAN | CONTACT CARTOONIST AT KAAVYAR@UMICH.EDU

T

his school year marks 
the dawn of a new 
era with the potential 
to 
redefine 
the 
future 
of 
brunch. 
Every 
current 
college 
student 
who enrolled right 
after 
graduating 
high 
school 
was 
likely 
born 
after 
1996, 
meaning 
members of Gen Z 
— 
not 
millennials 
— dominate college 
campuses. 
We 
now have an opportunity to 
evaluate millennial fads and 
redefine our own stereotypes. 
First 
on 
the 
list: 
bougie 
brunches.
I know this is controversial; 
lots of people like brunch! But 
part of that is because we are 
so used to looking up to the 
millennials among us and 
revering the culture they have 
created. Even though they 
are now gone from campus, I 
worry our generation seems to 
have caught the brunch fever. 
When I voice my anti-brunch 
sentiments, my friends tell 
me I should retire from the 
hot takes industry, that I am 
hating on good things and 
that I am just no fun.
But I am by no means the 
first person to make this claim 
— many fun people have made 
it before. During the peak of 
anti-millennial hatred in the 
mid-2010’s, 
headlines 
like 
“Brunch is for Jerks,” “Why 
brunch is stupid” and “The 
Complete Guide to Hating 
Brunch” peppered the news. 
However, 
vehement 
anti-
brunch 
sentiments 
have 
receded from the headlines. 
As the first wave of Gen Zers 
graduate college and join 
the traditional brunch-going 
demographic — young, urban 
professionals — we need to 
reignite 
the 
anti-brunch 
fervor. 
The first reason to be wary 
of brunch is that it is a made-
up genre of food. The food 
we consume at brunch is 
either breakfast food (eggs, 
potatoes, 
pancakes, 
etc.) 
or lunch food (sandwiches, 
salads, grain bowls, etc.). 
The brunch food category is 
fully fabricated, likely by the 

restaurant industry to allow 
us to justify spending money 
on food at any time of the day.
However, 
restaurants 
have 
more 
incentive 
than just getting 
people 
to 
eat 
more. They make 
a killing because 
they 
can 
serve 
breakfast 
food 
on lunch prices. 
The 
materials 
used 
to 
make 
breakfast 
food 
— eggs, potatoes and flour 
— are cheap, yet restaurants 
can get away with charging 
ludicrous prices for them. 
There 
is 
even 
an 
advice 
column recommending that 
struggling restaurants that 
need to increase profits start 
serving brunch. Unless your 
pancakes are infused with 
saffron or truffle mushrooms, 
there is no reason to be 
paying $17 for your mid-

morning meal. And eating 
brunch instead of breakfast 
and lunch will not decrease 
the amount of food you eat 
over the course of the day, so 
it is not actually a cost saving 
mechanism, it just changes 
the schedule. 
Part of my frustration is 
not with brunch but more 
with 
brunch 
culture. 
We 
should not wait in excessively 
long lines to pay exorbitant 
prices for foods that can 
easily be made inexpensively 
at home, and brunch is the 
most prolific manifestation 
of this phenomenon. We used 
to eat brunch in diners. But 
brunch has departed from its 
humble beginnings into an 
increasingly elitist enterprise. 
Across the country, diners 
have declined, especially in 

cities; in New York City, 60 
percent of diners have closed 
over the last 25 years. Instead 
of diners, brunch has become 
fancy. It now often serves 
as an indicator of higher 
socioeconomic 
status, 
and 
the research backs this up. 
The 
geographic 
locations 
where the number of brunch 
restaurants 
are 
expanding 
positively 
correlate 
with 
that population’s disposable 
income 
and 
free 
time, 
demonstrating 
a 
humble 
concept has been co-opted by 
the wealthy. 
Perhaps 
brunch’s 
only 
redeeming quality is that 
it 
liberates 
us 
from 
the 
restrictive confines of what 
we should eat and when. As a 
concept, brunch allows us to 
justify consuming breakfast 
food at any time of the day. 
Similarly, since brunch can be 
consumed any time between 
9:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m., it 
allows us to chip away at meal 
time constructs that restrict 
when it is socially acceptable 
to have a big meal. 
However, though attractive 
on the surface, brunch subtly 
reinforces those restrictions. 
Instead of creating more meal 
classifications, 
we 
should 
get rid of social constructs 
like 
mealtimes 
and 
fake 
designations about what food 
we should eat when. Why can’t 
I have quinoa for breakfast, 
cereal for dinner and a full 
meal at any time of the day? 
These social constructs are 
not scientifically based and 
are connected to legacies of 
colonial racism.
What 
we 
need 
is 
a 
revitalization of the home-
cooked 
mid-morning 
food 
hangout. When we wake up 
lazily and want to debrief the 
night with friends, instead of 
waiting in line for mediocre, 
overpriced 
breakfast 
food 
where the lighting is always 
a little too bright, we should 
slumber over to a comforting 
living room and make our 
own eggs and waffles. 
Except shameless plug for 
Frank’s: Everyone should get 
their “Famous French Toast.”

We need to 
reignite the anti-
brunch fervor

SAMANTHA SZUHAJ | COLUMN

T

here is a sense of wonder 
that accompanies the 
changing of seasons for 
me. Having grown 
up 
in 
northern 
California, 
where 
it is eternally 65 
degrees and slightly 
overcast, 
fall 
in 
Michigan 
was 
cinematic the first 
time I experienced 
it, and it still takes 
me 
aback 
when 
I 
walk 
through 
campus. Seeing the 
bright hues of trees dotting 
the sides of the streets and 
highways around Ann Arbor 
brings me nothing but joy 
and warmth. There is an 
inherent sense of festivity 
that accompanies the season 
and an authenticity that the 
West Coast landscape of my 
upbringing lacks.
The 
autumn 
of 
my 
freshman year also brought 
the realization that I was 
far from home. Despite the 
whirlwind of commotion that 
constituted the beginning 
of my first year, I distinctly 
remember the first cold day. 
I had come to school with 
a single sweater and coat, 
blissfully unaware as to how 
quickly the relief from the 
summer heat quickly became 
the frigid nature of fall and 
winter. 
I 
remember 
my 
awe quickly morphing into 
homesickness, a longing for 
warmth and a familiar face 
in the sea of undergraduate 
students. 
I know I am not alone in 
this feeling — I still find 
myself feeling this way. 
As my third year in Ann 
Arbor 
continues 
on, 
my 
perspective 
has 
slightly 
shifted. Fall is still this 
magical 
time 
in 
which 
nature really is in its prime. 
The leaves still carpet the 
grass and sidewalks, people 

come and go in costumes 
and venture to cider mills on 
the weekends. But now, fall 
is not something 
that 
makes 
me 
long 
for 
home 
(except for maybe 
the 
California 
weather), but just 
a 
reminder 
of 
how I am living a 
new 
experience, 
independent 
of 
what I had been 
accustomed to for 
so long. With the 
comings and goings of the 
seasons every year, personal 
change 
has 
followed. 
Friends, activities, academic 
interests, 
experiences, 
the type of music I like at 
the time or a new snack 
food obsession — time has 
brought these changes, big 
and small, over time.

Three years ago, I stood 
in the rain, lost on my 
way 
to 
class, 
terrified 
of how to make my way 
as a student here at the 
University 
of 
Michigan, 
knowing little about what 
I wanted to do and having 
few familiar faces. I called 
my 
mom, 
overwhelmed 
with this sense of panicked 
uncertainty. 
I 
explained 
what was happening, and 
after 
patiently 
listening, 
she gave me a single piece of 
advice: Find something that 
reminds you of home. 

Life in its stages brings 
in the new, for the good 
and 
the 
bad. 
Sometimes 
we can predict it, like the 
changing of seasons, and 
other times we cannot, like 
getting caught in the rain on 
a windy fall day. It is what 
we do with that change and 
how we embrace it moving 
forward 
that 
makes 
the 
largest impact on our lives. 
As students, our lives are 
constantly 
bringing 
the 
new 
into 
our 
somewhat 
established 
routines 
and 
livelihoods. My past self 
found this difficult, and at 
times I still find it difficult. 
But the key to how I have 
managed to deal with the 
newness, homesickness and 
distance is to find familiar 
things from home and work 
them into my life wherever 
I find myself — eating food 
that 
reminds 
me 
of 
my 
family’s cooking, watching 
my 
hometown 
sports 
teams play or listening to 
music that I connect to my 
childhood. Carrying a bit of 
the old into the new offers 
a sense of security and 
something I can fall back on. 
After talking to my mom 
on that rainy day, I rushed 
home and got a big bowl of 
vegetable soup, something 
I would always eat on rare 
rainy days as a kid. It was a 
temporary fix, but it offered 
a greater lesson as to the 
importance of incorporating 
the old into the new. So, as 
we all embrace fall and the 
change 
that 
comes 
with 
it, remember to seek out 
the old and comfortable as 
things seem unfamiliar or 
uncertain. 
Carry 
yourself 
through with the familiar, 
as I plan to do — starting 
with a big bowl of soup.

Hailing from the metropolis of São Paulo, the Brazilian Tropicália band Os Mutantes’s 
(which translates to “The Mutants”) 1968 self-titled album somehow sounds as if The 
Beatles moved to South America and took even more psychedelics. One of the most 
creative groups to ever come out of the country with a rich musical history rivaling 
any others, their success was brief at the time they were active, but their name has seen 
somewhat of a resurgence decades later. 
The group’s origins lie in the relationship that developed between Rita Lee Jones and 
Arnaldo Baptista when they were both teenagers in the mid-1960s. Along with Arnaldo’s 
younger brother Sérgio, they formed Os Mutantes in 1965, and within a couple years, 
they found themselves in the middle of one of Brazil’s burgeoning musical movements. 
Spearheaded by the singer Caetano Veloso as well as others such as Gilberto Gil and 
Nara Leão, the Tropicália movement was born. 
At the time, Brazil was under the rule of a brutal military dictatorship which heavily 
espoused conservative/traditionalist views. Tropicália emerged as a countercultural 
movement that was at its core musical, but encompassed much more. Veloso, Gil and 
the other early collaborators wished to infuse the traditional samba and Bossa Nova 
forms with influences from psychedelic rock.
Ironically, the music, epitomized by the 1968 collaboration album/manifesto 
Tropicália: Ou Panis et Circensis (Tropicalism, or bread and circuses), seemed to anger 
both sides of the political spectrum. According to the band’s current label Luaka 
Bop, the right-wing dictatorship despised its inherent subversiveness, and the left 
viewed certain elements of it as representing a capitulation to the Anglophone world’s 
imperialism. 
The genre unfortunately would not live long, as its architects Veloso and Gil were 
imprisoned and eventually exiled by the end of the decade. While they continued 
to record and release music in England, the movement itself faltered without their 
presence and leadership. Groups including Os Mutantes and the Bahia based Novos 
Baianos carried the flag for a short period, yet the genre never again reached its early 
peak.
Both the genre’s as well as Os Mutantes’s increase in popularity outside of Brazil 
stem from a compilation (titled Everything is Possible: The Best of Os Mutantes) released 
in 1999 by David Byrne on his label, the aforementioned Luaka Bop, as well as name 
drops by figures such as Kurt Cobain. Bands ever since such as of Montreal have cited 
the unhinged chaos on the band’s early records. 
Appearing both on “Everything is 
Possible” and the self-titled “A Minha 
Menina,” a cover of a song by compatriot 
Jorge Ben Jor, is as good a poster child 
as any of this chaos. The distinctive 
psychedelic fuzz present in the chorus is 
a result of an ad-hoc pedal “powered by 
a sewing machine” built by Arnaldo and 
Sérgio’s older brother. Will Hodgkinson 
of The Guardian notes that this, as well as 
other jury-rigged elements of their musical 
setup, were made necessary due to “the 
lack of decent musical equipment in 1960s 
Brazil.” 
“A Minha Menina,” as well as other 
notable cuts such as “Panis Et Circenses” 
impressively never collapse under their 
own weight, considering just how much 
is thrown onto these tracks. Just as with 
The Avalanches’s 2000 plunderphonics 
masterpiece Since I Left You, each new listen 
of an Os Mutantes track reveals a small 
detail previously unnoticed. Moreover, it’s 
impossible to tell whether certain elements 
were a product of lack of equipment or an 
act of irreverent genius. 
As with many of their influences such as 
Jimi Hendrix and Sly and the Family Stone, 
heavy drug use and internal dysfunction 
brought about a premature end, with 
the subsequent years not proving quite 
productive for the trio, including episodes 
such as Arnaldo trying to unsuccessfully 
escape from a psychiatric institution. 
However, the band reunited in the 
early 2000s and continue to display the 
timelessness of their groundbreaking ’60s 
output.

Subversive strength

“Pain and Glory,” directed by Pedro Almodóvar (“Julieta”), 
is one of those rare movies that feels like the culmination of its 
creator. Like Lynch’s “Eraserhead,” Gerwig’s “Lady Bird” and 
Cuarón’s “Roma,” it’s the film that its director was meant to 
make, perfectly blending their talents, personal aesthetic and 
life story to spectacular effect.
Almodóvar incorporates aspects of his life into “Pain and 
Glory,” and the conflicts feel bracingly personal, like flipping 
through someone’s diary and learning dark, juicy secrets. 
Yet, beyond this he captures something deeper, something 
universally human. “Pain and Glory” deals with what we’re 

all afraid to admit, the existential questions that keep us up at 
night.
The story of Salvador Mallo (Antonio Banderas, “The 
Laundromat”), an aging director living in Madrid coping with 
terrible health problems, will touch every viewer personally. 
One will wonder “how did they know this about me?” as they 
see aspects of their own lives play out on the screen. Be it lost 
love, family dysfunction, the terrible moments when one’s body 
turns against itself or a loss of purpose, “Pain and Glory” is 
unflinching about what makes life so difficult. Yet there’s also 
love, desire and creativity. It asks which one triumphs in the 
end: the pain or the glory of our lives?
“Pain and Glory” begins with Salvador visiting Alberto (Asier 
Etxeandia, “The Silent War”), an estranged friend and actor in 
one of his most famous films. This meeting sends Salvador down 
a troubled, fascinating journey of 
recollection. Not much happens 
on a narrative level — “Pain and 
Glory” is more about characters 
than plot — yet there are soaring 
victories 
and 
crushing 
defeats 
all the same. Salvador needs to 
decide how he will live out the 
rest of his days: Wasting away in 
his apartment and lamenting days 
gone by, or directing something 
new, even if it causes him physical 
agony.
Almodóvar cuts from Banderas’s 
Salvador to his younger self (Asier 
Flores) and back again, paralleling 
past events with present ones. His 
formative experiences with his 
mother (Penélope Cruz, “Murder 
on The Orient Express”) and a 
family 
friend 
named 
Eduardo 
(César Vicente) are vital additions 
to the story, not the unneceary 
gimmicks that flackbacks tend to 
be.
Wielding 
emotions 
like 
Hitchcock wielded plot, Almodóvar 
doles heartbreak, joy and mystery 

out slowly as layers of Salvador’s life are pulled back, letting it 
all build until astonishing truths are revealed.
Most of the audience wept throughout the last hour of the film. 
The excellent performances convey Almodóvar’s confessional 
script perfectly, making it strikingly genuine, like it’s more than 
just a movie. Every conversation sears with emotion, from the 
hilariously witty to the brutally tragic. Relationships are given 
ample room to grow, yet when the credits roll, one will wish 
there was more time to send with these enthralling characters.
“Pain and Glory” is shot with the colorful vision of an auteur 
and every scene pops, from stark white sheets on a lush, pastoral 
Spanish riverside to a chic modern Madrid apartment where 
Guggenheim-sought art hangs on the walls. It is rare to find 
a movie where everyone involved is on the top of their game. 
Almodóvar and the team behind “Pain and Glory” have created 
a stunning portrait of love, loss and, ultimately, humanity. It’s 
a masterpiece.

‘Pain and Glory’ is a masterful portrait of life and loss

Pain and Glory

Sony Pictures

State Theatre

SONY PICTURES CLASSICS

Over the past 12 years, Lady Antebellum has reigned 
over the sweetest slice of pop-country. Trio Hillary Scott, 
Charles Kelley and Dave Haywood have successfully 
cornered the Nashville market on heavenly harmonies 
and airy, mandolin-heavy instrumentals. Wholesome 
yet candy-coated, the resulting sound is like honey: 
consistently 
warm 
and 
shimmery. 
This 
is a soundscape that 
Ocean, the band’s latest 
release, leans further 
into. 
While 
sonically 
unsurprising, 
the 
album’s 
start 
is 
thematically 
unusual 
— it’s fearful. “What If 
I Never Get Over You” 
asks its title in earnest. 
“What if time doesn’t 
do what it’s supposed 
to do?” Scott questions, 
pushing back on the 
typical break-up song 
narrative that, for better or for worse, soon the ex will be 
forgotten. Instead, this song dares to dive into a worry 
that’s generally written off as melodramatic,and it does so 
thoughtfully.
The political statement of the album, “You Can Do 
You” misses the mark. “You can lean left, you can lean 
right” Lady A allows, then concludes that “We could all 
use a drink.” While the intentions behind this track are 
forgivable — the need to unify a live crowd in 2019 — it 
feels like they’re trying too hard. With a beachy, bouncy 
backdrop the hook “You can do you, I’ma do me” just 
sounds out of touch. 
“What I’m Leaving For” brings the band back down to 
what it does best: capturing the smaller moments. “Got my 
bags packed, got my ticket / got my heartache to go with 
it” Scott sighs as she kisses her kids goodbye for work. 
Although 
Lady 
A 
didn’t 
write 
this 
song, 
it 
feels like a peek 
behind the scenes 
fans 
haven’t 
seen before and 
doubles 
as 
a 
reminder of the 
group members’ 
other 
jobs 
as 
parents. 
“Be 
Patient 
With My Love” 
is 
a 
different 
kind of reminder. 
“Mighta done it 
this time / mighta 
drank too much 
wine” 
Kelley 
admits. 
This 
level of honesty 
is unseen on the 
group’s previous 
work and made 
all the more raw 
because 
Kelley 
co-wrote it. “I’m 
coming back to 

the man that I was / so please don’t give up” he pleads 
over a chorus of contemplative strings. 
“Alright” is classic Lady Antebellum, sunny and 
surface-level. Reading the lyrics: “No lie, no lie, no lie, 
yeah / it’s alright, alright, alright, yeah” suggests that, if 
anything, this song should be a guilty pleasure. But it isn’t. 
The hook is so infectious and reassuring that you barely 
notice the lazy writing.
Despite the band’s sunny magic, the best songs on 
Ocean sound suited for a wintery evening. “On a Night 
Like This” is a lovely, 
if 
somewhat 
plain, 
piano ballad. Scott and 
Kelley shine on their 
delivery of whimsical 
lyrics, 
namely 
“The 
days last sight turns 
to cool nights breeze 
/ And this love hangs 
thick like these willow 
leaves.”
“The 
Thing 
That 
Wrecks You” is, in 
fact, 
the 
song 
that 
wrecks you on this 
album. A collaboration 
with Little Big Town, 
another 
pop-country 
powerhouse, its members are given the chance to meet 
Kelley and Scott’s synergy and rise to the occasion. A song 
about an uneven relationship from the perspective of the 
person in power, it’s minute-long underwater-sounding 
outro is haunting. “You’re a deer in headlights / and I’m 
driving just as fast as I can” warns Little Big Town until 
both bands explode into the chorus.
For the most part, Ocean is predictable. It all glitters, 
but some songs are fool’s gold. Tracks like “Pictures” and 
“Boots” merely take up space while “You Can Do You” 
actually does some damage. Still, other songs dig deeper 
than usual. The title track “Ocean,” a piano ballad, finds 
Scott vulnerable, begging an emotionally-distant lover 
to open up. Peeling back a layer while retaining their 
evergreen sound, Lady Antebellum retains their pop-
country crown by delivering more of the same.

If you’d like to join me in hitting the gas on 
emerging female pop as a means to quell over-
thinking and just get dancey, then BENEE is 
the woman for you. 
Stella 
Bennett, 
who 
goes 
by 
BENEE 
(pronounced Benny), just dropped a new EP 
STELLA & STEVE, which follows the success 
of her debut EP 
from 
earlier 
this year, FIRE 
ON MARZZ. 
BENEE 
is 
a 
19-year-old 
pop artist from 
Auckland, 
New 
Zealand. 
After 
winning 
four 
times 
at 
the 2019 New 
Zealand Music 
Awards, 
she’s 
blowing up with 
Spotify streams 
in the same way 
she’s 
blowing 
up my shower 
dance playlist. 
Where 
FIRE 
ON 
MARZZ 
was a cosmic explosion (with killer animated 
art to match the soundscape), STELLA & 
STEVE chills down and bunkers in on laid-
back grooves. 
BENEE was introduced to me while I was 
sitting in the back row of a Pacifica minivan. 
This felt intentional; the Pacifica as a whole 
needed a remedy from mindless transit and 
BENEE stepped up to the plate. On a six-
hour drive with six people who each had 
vastly different music tastes, she was one of 
the few artists that pulled people’s heads off 
the windows to ask, “who’s this?” Following 
my time in the Pacifica, I went on a bender 
of testing out BENEE’s universal pacifying 
quality, watching to see how she can satisfy a 
diverse room with pop that eases. She hasn’t 
failed me yet.

A week after the drive, Pacifica vibes came 
full circle — BENEE dropped STELLA & 
STEVE, Stella being herself and Steve being 
her car (which she stands on in the EP cover 
art). In an interview with Billboard she says: 
“‘I call everything Steve. Since I was little, 
I’d go on, like, holiday and call hermit crabs 
Steve,’ she said. ‘And I still do. I’ll name a 
snail Steve. Everything is called Steve in my 
world. My car is also called Steve.’”
STELLA & STEVE continued to become 
oddly 
ethereal 
for me due to 
lead 
single 
“Find 
an 
Island.” BENEE 
started 
as 
a 
means 
of 
escape for me, 
and 
“Find 
an 
Island” focuses 
on the dreams 
of 
an 
island 
far 
far 
away, 
hooking 
you 
with its bouncy 
three-beat 
rise 
and 
fall. 
The escape of 
BENEE mostly 
comes from her 
smooth 
lower 
register, which 
is the equivalent of eating a Godiva truffle. 
I find an island far away from here with the 
ease of her melodious pop and her badass 
self-assurance. I don’t need to think hard 
listening to BENEE. I can just sit in the back 
of a Pacifica and exist. 
The EP’s capture of carefree shows up best 
in “Supalonely,” featuring Gus Dapperton. 
The amusing swing of “ooo, ah, yeah, I’m 
lonely” makes you lean your head back with 
a sly smirk. The lyrics on “Monsta” do the 
same, hitting you with silly daggers: “But then 
instead of eatin’ me, he offers me a blueberry.” 
BENEE is an animated, laid-back adventure. 
She is the off-switch to a brain on overdrive, 
and she’s definitely my next on-the-rise-star 
in my recent expedition of escapist female 
pop.

BENEE’s latest is beautiful

ALBUM REVIEW

Any good show creator knows that with 
animation, you can push the boundaries of 
where you want your show to go. Couple that 
with Adult Swim’s infamous raunchy style, add 
a dash of science fiction and sarcasm and you 
get “Rick and Morty,” arguably one of the most 
meaningful Adult Swim shows out there. It’s 
amassed a loyal and devoted following ever 
since its rocky beginning back in 2013, and has 
recently been renewed for 70 more episodes. 
But fans rejoice, because it’s back from the 
dead with no lapse in quality or humor. The 
show bounces back and levels up in its own 
witty, symbolic and chaotic way. The season 
premiere is almost just like a regular episode 
of “Rick and Morty” but on steroids, which was 
necessary and appreciated after such a long 
hiatus.
The 
season 
premiere 
kicks 
off 
with 
an extremely loose parody of “Edge of 
Tomorrow,” which is nothing unfamiliar to 
the series as its humor and plot points are 
often heavily reference-based. The episode 
immediately addresses the change in the 
family dynamics, as Jerry (Chris Parnell, “Will 
& Grace”) forces Beth (Sarah Chalke, “Milo 
Murphy’s Law”) to make Rick (Justin Roiland, 
“The Cyanide & Happiness Show”) abide by 
the new protocol that requires him to ask for 
permission to take Morty (Justin Roiland, 
“The Cyanide & Happiness Show”) with him 
during his adventures rather than whisk him 
away at a moment’s notice. They fly off into 
space to harvest death crystals that show you 
how the way you’re going to die and how it 
changes with the decisions you make. Always 
the naive one, Morty hides one in his pocket 

and sets out to do the exact right things to end 
up with his longtime unrequited love, Jessica 
(Kari Wahlgren, “DC Super Hero Girls”). Rick 
ends up getting brutally impaled in a spaceship 
accident, 
and 
thus 
has 
to 
continuously 
reincarnate himself using clones from parallel 
universes in order to find his way back home. 
To resurrect the fanbase from its lengthy 
hibernation, the premiere uses harmless fan 
service by referencing past seasons. They don’t 
make the mistake of letting the references get 
in the way of the plot; it only serves to excite 
fans who had been begging for an inkling of 
“Rick and Morty”-related material for what 
seemed like an eternity. It’s almost so chaotic 
that it’s difficult to keep up with everything 
going on at once. It took me a couple watches 
to fully understand and connect where this 
episode is in relation to the past three seasons, 
but its complexity is nothing to fear. It’s always 
a gift when shows have something to offer 
every time you rewatch it, and with shows 
that are as quick-witted as this, it’s nearly 
impossible to catch on to all the jokes and 
references in the first go. 
But that’s not to say that the premiere didn’t 
offer anything to the start of the season. “Rick 
and Morty” never fails to craft fresh new ideas 
to bring into the mix, and this new season is 
no different. It has layers in ways that many 
shows lack and proves that overlap between 
quality and Adult Swim-type networks (which 
people often make snap judgements about 
being superficially vulgar) can exist. One can 
only hope that the 70-episode renewal won’t 
constitute a decrease in quality, but at this 
rate, I doubt we have anything to worry about. 
Since the start of the series, it’s only been an 
uphill spiral of wit and creativity, and after 
this break, I’m sure the creators aren’t willing 
to let it slip through their fingers again.

STELLA & STEVE

Republic Records


Lavert Hill bounced down the 

Michigan sideline, waiving his arms 

in jubilation with his helmet in hand. 

Behind him, the rest of the Wolverines 

did the same, spilling onto the field, 

toward the stands and everywhere in 

between.

The celebration — set off by Hill’s 

fourth-quarter interception — had been 

brewing all game, as No. 15 Michigan 

(5-2 Big Ten, 8-2 overall) charged toward 

a 44-10 win.

“When (Hill) got his pick, you could 

just feel the intensity, you could feel it 

through him,” said senior safety Josh 

Metellus. “And the vibe that he had just 

went throughout the whole stadium, 

from the field to the fans to the top row. 

You could just tell that this team knew 

that we did today.”

It was a day that started like very few 

in the recent history of this rivalry. For 

11 years before Saturday, Michigan State 

(2-5 Big Ten, 4-6 overall) had avoided 

losing back-to-back games against 

the Wolverines, marking its longest 

period of in-state dominance since the 

1950s. But on the back of four straight 

Spartans losses, the pregame air carried 

an encompassing sense that this was 

Michigan’s year.

The win, though, wasn’t always so 

straightforward.

Three quarters before jubilation 

radiated through Michigan Stadium, 

Shea Patterson lined up with his heels 

on the goal line, staring down 98 yards of 

empty grass in front of him.

That’s how you begin a drive when 

you can’t get anything going offensively, 

when even your defensive stops concede 

field position, when a seemingly lopsided 

rivalry matchup is tied, 7-7, midway 

through the second quarter.

Twelve plays later, it was all forgotten.

Nick Eubanks flexed in front of the 

student section, touchdown catch in 

hand, capping off a magnificent, ruthless 

scoring drive. It was everything once 

promised out of Josh Gattis’ offense, 

with Michigan’s best offensive weapons 

being put in positions to exploit a 

depleted Spartans’ defense.

The Wolverines carried that 

momentum through the rest of the day, 

scoring on their last eight drives and 

erasing the tone of offensive frustration 

that marked a disappointing first 

quarter.

“It was just a huge drive,” said 

sophomore receiver Ronnie Bell. And 

once we put points on the board, you 

could just feel it rolling and we just 

stepped on it and kept it going.”

Patterson stood at the center of it all, 

the protagonist in a story of shifting 

rivalry tides. Hailed as the final piece of 

a program on the precipice of glory when 

he arrived from Ole Miss two years ago, 

Patterson’s time in Ann Arbor won’t end 

with a national championship or a Big 

Ten title. There’s no Heisman Trophy 

heading to Schembechler Hall next 

month.

What he has is a second-consecutive 

Paul Bunyan Trophy.

It’s a trophy Patterson clutched 

Saturday afternoon at midfield, fresh off 

the best performance of his Michigan 

career — eclipsing his domination of the 

Spartans last year. After entering the day 

without a 300-yard game as a Wolverine, 

he finished with 384 yards and four 

touchdowns.

“Just wish I had two more shots at 

them,” Patterson said postgame, his 

typically stoic face dotted with emotion. 

“Just wish I had four shots at them. It 

was a lot of fun.”

Bell was the biggest beneficiary in 

Michigan’s receiving corps with 150 

yards on nine catches, his being one of 

many standpoint performances. This 

was an all-encompassing display of 

dominance, spreading to the Wolverines’ 

defense, with its three sacks, two 

interceptions and 3.7 yards allowed per 

play.

It’s a display of dominance that 

continued to cement Michigan’s 

re-emerging control over the state — a 

significance not lost on these Wolverines.

As the teams congregated at midfield 

postgame, the Spartans tried to linger, 

offering a few words of contention 

toward Michigan’s sideline — just one 

confrontation in a day full of them. 

Metellus wasn’t having it.

“I was telling them to go home,” 

Metellus said. “It’s time for them to 

leave. They don’t deserve to be in our 

stadium.”

WOLVERINES SEND SPARTANS BACK TO EAST LANSING WITH BLOWOUT LOSS

Ronnie Bell 
is ready to 
write his 
own story

As the Michigan football team 
returned to the sideline with the end 
zone covered in towels, a stadium 
rocking and the game in hand, Ronnie 
Bell had his helmet off. He was talking 
to Josh Gattis. It was the start of the 
fourth quarter and the game was well 
in hand, the Wolverines leading by 24. 
Whatever advice was being given, it 
probably wasn’t urgent.
On the next drive, Bell bubbled out 
for a screen and got upfield. As tempers 
flared and flags were thrown, he tossed 
the ball nicely to the referee, and when 
his yardage got waved off in favor of a 
penalty on Michigan State, he bubbled 
out again for another 12 yards.
That was Bell on Saturday — the calm 
in the center of a storm, a constant amid 
shifting emotions. As Michigan rode its 
passing game to a 44-10 beatdown of 
the Spartans, Bell found himself the 
team’s leading receiver for the fifth 
time this year with 150 yards on nine 
catches. 
“Ronnie Bell, that was a career 
game so far,” said Michigan coach Jim 
Harbaugh. “Young career, so there’s 
more to go, but he was running hard. It 
was hard to tackle Ronnie Bell today.”
Perhaps it’s worth talking about that 
on its own, with no predetermined 
narrative. A sophomore receiver, Bell’s 
career has been pulled through so many 
lenses that it can be hard to remember 
to give him any credit.
Just last month, after dropping a 
potential game-tying touchdown at 
Penn State, Bell unwittingly found 
himself the focus of both vitriol and a 
larger discussion about how fans treat 
college athletes, prompted by an email 
sent to him. Throughout the season, he 
has gotten ire simply because he was 
targeted more than other purportedly 
more talented receivers. Before that, 
he was pigeonholed as an ex-basketball 
recruit.
On Saturday, Bell got to write his 
own story. It was a pretty good one, and 
it went like this: The most receptions 
by a Michigan player this year and the 
first time a receiver has broken 100 
yards. A spark lit on a 98-yard second-
quarter touchdown drive when senior 
quarterback Shea Patterson extended 
a play and Bell found an open spot in 
the middle of the field, then turned 
to make it an 18-yard gain. Two more 
key catches on the next drive, the first 
a second-down curl for a short gain 
and the next a slot fade that went for 
42 yards when a defender fell down, 
giving Bell nothing but grass to run in 
as he stumbled towards the sideline. 
Another curl on Michigan’s first drive 
of the second half, this one for 20 yards 
and to set up a Donovan Peoples-Jones 
touchdown on the very next play.
You get the picture.
“We’ve developed a certain kind of 
chemistry,” Patterson said. “And I think 
we just play well together — Donovan 
and Ronnie and all those guys. When 
stuff breaks down in the pocket, they 
just find the open space. At that point, 
you’re just playing backyard football.”
Bell is a two-star basketball recruit, 
he dropped a key pass in State College 
and he does not have the same NFL 
potential as Peoples-Jones or Nico 
Collins. It turns out, he’s still pretty 
good.
Good enough to have earned the 
trust of Patterson and Harbaugh. Good 
enough to have kept it after that drop 
last month and good enough to have 
bounced back, to sit at a podium smiling 
after a dominant performance over a 
rival just three games later.
“The support that I got — my family, 
my friends, this team — it’s unreal and 
it’s a blessing,” Bell said. “And they all 
picked me up.”
Bell hasn’t scored a touchdown yet 
this year, a fact brought up afterwards. 
It doesn’t matter. The Wolverines 
carved up the Spartans for 467 yards 
on Saturday in a dominant win, and 
Bell was right in the middle of it. In a 
receiving depth chart that includes 
Collins, Peoples-Jones and Tarik Black 
— three NFL talents presumed to have 
a stranglehold on targets when the 
season started — Bell has carved out a 
place for himself at the top.
“I don’t know, man, there’s just 
something special about the vibe that 
we had today when Shea was throwing 
the ball in warmups,” Bell said. “Guys 
were just running around, everybody 
was playing so hard and we just 
executed at a high level and it showed.”
And, on the best day of Michigan’s 
season so far, Bell was the story. For 
once, he was the author.

Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 
stopped Shea Patterson moments 
before he trotted onto the field to 
put the finishing touches on his best 
performance as a Wolverine.
“I told him before he went out 
to take that snap, I said, ‘Now this 
year, after you take the kneel down, 
keep the ball and don’t throw it 
up in the air,’ Harbaugh recalled. 
“Because he had a heckuva game 
and I thought he should have the 
game ball.”
“I’ve got another plan,” Patterson 
replied.
The senior quarterback took his 
kneel from the pistol, let the clock 
wilt away and darted straight back 
to the sideline to hand the ball back 
to his coach.
It was a snapshot befitting of 
the moment — the new high-point 
of a marriage between coach and 
quarterback that was consummated 
just two years ago. Patterson tallied 
384 yards, his single-game high at 
Michigan, and four touchdowns in 
the Wolverines’ 44-10 romp over 
Michigan State, his fingerprints 
lining the game from start to finish.
In a game rife with confrontation, 
Patterson held above the fray 
— calm, patient, professorial — 
taking what was given at first, 
then pushing the envelope when 
opportunity arose.
“They were dropping a lot in 
coverage fairly early on,” Patterson 
said. 
“We 
started 
taking 
the 
underneath stuff. Then they started 
playing underneath, and took the 
over-the-top stuff.”
On the first drive of the game, 
Patterson 
found 
sophomore 
receiver 
Ronnie 
Bell 
streaking 
toward the sideline while rolling 
to his left on third-and-14. The duo 
combined for nine catches and 150 
yards, furthering a chemistry that 
has been evident all year. On his 

last drive, he sold the quarterback 
run, only to find freshman receiver 
Cornelius Johnson streaking down 
the left sideline for a 39-yard 
touchdown. 
He celebrated by turning to his 
sideline and thrusting his arms in 
the air, a typically stoic personality 
suddenly vibrant. The players on the 
sideline responded. The remaining 
crowd bounced. This game meant 
more to everyone, but for the senior, 
now 2-0 against Michigan’s in-state 
rival, there was a healthy urgency.

“He just brought a different 
type of passion today,” said junior 
receiver Donovan Peoples-Jones. 
“He’s always passionate, but today, 
the whole team, it meant a little 
bit more. All throughout the week 
I could see it in practice. He was 
confident with his reads, confident 
with his throws. He trusted us, he 
trusted the gameplan.”
Still, 
it 
was 
the 
kind 
of 
performance, beginning to end, 
Michigan has hardly seen from 
Patterson in his two years at the 
helm. And it was one that appeared 
to catch the opponents off guard.
At the beginning of the fourth 
quarter, 
Patterson 
hit 
junior 
receiver Nico Collins in stride for 
a 22-yard touchdown, giving the 
Wolverines a 34-10 lead with one 
of his 14 pass plays of 15 yards or 

more. Michigan State coach Mark 
Dantonio looked on, head craned 
forward. Ten seconds passed, but 
Dantonio didn’t so much as blink.
Then, clipboard in his right hand, 
Dantonio dismissively thrust his 
arm forward, turned around and 
receded into the sideline.
“Didn’t anticipate they would 
throw the ball as effectively as 
they did,” Dantonio said after 
the game. “Too many third-down 
opportunities where we had the 
chance to get off the field, we did 
not. Some credit to them, some 
discredit to us in terms of coverage 
play or whatever.”
Patterson 
hardly 
felt 
like 
delineating such credit or blame. 
“This one’s special. I’m proud to 
just be a part of this team, part of a 
dominating win like that. We knew 
how important this game was, and 
we prepared our tails off. Like I 
said, I wish I had two more chances 
(to play Michigan State).”
Still, between the lines of his 
post-game 
comments 
was 
an 
implicit understanding. Michigan 
will not win the Big Ten title or 
make the playoff, but it has goals 
— namely, one goal — still in sight. 
Patterson knows as well as anyone 
that a duplicate performance two 
weeks from Saturday will give his 
team a shot to do what it’s done just 
once in 16 years.
He will not get two more shots at 
Michigan State. But he will get one 
final shot at something more.
Harbaugh, Patterson and co. will 
bask in this one for now, though 
— the kind of game that will leave 
an imprint on an already reeling 
opposing locker room. 
As for capping that off, Harbaugh 
had one last piece of business to 
take care before coming out to 
speak with the media.
“(I) went back in the locker room 
and (the game ball is) now in his 
book bag,” Harbaugh clarified. “I 
shoved it back in his backpack.”

For Michigan 

State and Mark 

Dantonio, what 

now?
M

ichigan rushed the field, lifting 
the Paul Bunyan trophy in the 
end zone and gesturing to the 
crowd.
Mark Dantonio 
walked off slowly, fol-
lowing his team into 
the tunnel.
A few minutes later, 
as Dantonio sat in a 
cramped press room, 
the green and white 
video backdrop not 
quite covering the 
maize and blue one, 
Dantonio faced the 
music. Last week, after a collapse and a 
loss to Illinois, Dantonio evaded every-
one’s questions. But after losing to his most 
hated rival, 44-10, he could no longer lean 
on “next question.”
“Disappointing opportunity lost,” he 
said. “We go forward, gotta recollect our-
selves. ... Our focus will always be on what 
happens next.”
But what is next for Dantonio and 
Michigan State?
A 6-6 season? The Quick Lane Bowl? 
Nostalgia about the Spartans’ best win 
over … Indiana?
Maybe this is Dantonio’s last stand, 
though Michigan State’s athletic depart-
ment has stuck by him all season, and 
Dantonio seemingly has too much pride to 
go out like this.
Regardless of whether or not this is the 
end, this wasn’t how it was supposed to 
happen.
Dantonio was the coach who brought 
the Spartans back to prominence, who 
flipped the rivalry on its head and went 
8-4 against the Wolverines before Satur-
day. Dantonio was the coach who heard 
his program called “little brother” and 
warned that pride comes before the fall.
This was the coach who took scrappy 
Michigan State teams and led them to vic-
tory on botched snaps and defensive slogs, 
the one who had a bag full of trick plays 
and made everyone believe he could win 
any game. Even here, at the Big House, a 
limping 4-5 team against one that was 7-2 
and playing its best football of the season. 
If anyone could do it, Dantonio could.
Now, this is the coach who prevented 
all but his captains from speaking to the 
media to avoid distractions and instructed 
his players to come off the bus wearing 
helmets to get in game mode — and got 
run off the field. The coach who got beat 
so badly the opposing players told him to 
go home.
Senior quarterback Shea Patterson 
threw for four touchdowns. Michigan led 
by 10 at halftime, then ran up the score 
and clamped down defensively. The Wol-
verines gained 467 yards.
“Unacceptable,” said Michigan State 
safety David Dowell.
Once, that kind of performance against 
Michigan was not only unacceptable for 
the Spartans, but unheard of.
Now, it’s reality.
“The game sorta went from 24-10 to 
31-10 to 37-10 and then boom,” Dantonio 
said. “Very quickly from there.”
He talked about how his team commit-
ted a false start and were forced to punt, 
how that punt was subsequently blocked 
and the Wolverines scored a touchdown 
on the next play. That was when the Spar-
tans knew it was over.
He talked about how the Wolverines 
torched Michigan State with screen passes 
and converted far too often on third down.
How now, it’s time to win two games, 
because that’s what the Spartans have to 
do just to get to a bowl.
During the press conference, players 
and reporters alike danced around the 
Dantonio question. But one asked about 
the leadership and if the message needed 
to change.
“We have the leadership, as far as 
coaches and as players, we have leadership 
in place,” said linebacker Tyriq Thompson. 
“And if we didn’t have faith and belief and 
trust in that, and the people that are lead-
ing, then they wouldn’t be there in the first 
place.”
That was as close to a referendum on 
Dantonio as anyone was going to get, and 
in a lot of ways, he earned that trust. No 
matter how this season ends, he’s still the 
best coach in program history.
But something more monumental hap-
pened at the Big House on Saturday than 
the difference between a .500 season and 
a winning one, or the difference between a 
middling bowl and a bottom-tier one.
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh, once 
left in the dust in exactly these sorts of 
rivalry games, seized back the rivalry in 
one fell swoop. Dantonio, who survived so 
many questions because he could still beat 
Michigan, seemed to no longer be able to 
do just that.

Despite 
an 
inconsistent 
offensive performance in the 
first half, the Michigan men’s 
basketball team handily defeated 
Elon, 70-50, at home on Friday 
night behind strong defensive 
performances from senior center 
Jon Teske and senior guard 
Zavier Simpson.
Marred by fouls and apparent 
rhythm 
issues 
on 
offense, 
Michigan got off to a slow 
start, not scoring its first points 
until two minutes into the 
game despite a substantial size 
advantage on the Phoenix. The 
Wolverines did not take their 
first lead until five minutes had 
gone by, and they relinquished 
that lead just two minutes later. 
For much of the first half, the 
Wolverines’ shots did not fall, 
their offense as cold as the 
temperatures outside.
“It was just a little bit – we 
were stagnant,” said sophomore 
forward Colin Castleton. “It’s 
just moving the ball more, not 
just getting one pass and one 
shot. (Michigan coach Juwan 
Howard) wanted five or six 
passes. Just keep the ball moving, 
and we’ll find our energy.”
The defense kept Michigan 
in the game throughout the 
offensive 
woes. 
Teske 
and 
Castleton made the most of their 
sizeable height advantage, and 
Simpson and sophomore guard 
David 
DeJulius 
were 
tough 
matchups in the backcourt.
But something seemed to click 
for Michigan offensively around 
the eight-minute mark in the 
first half. The Wolverines took 
back their lead as DeJulius hit a 
jumper and Teske made a layup 
on a pass from Simpson thirty 
seconds later, putting Michigan 
back on top, 14-13.
From there, the Wolverines 
seized control of the pace of the 
game. On offense, their passes 

were sharper and their shooting 
cleaner; on defense, Simpson 
forced Elon into shots they 
couldn’t make, and the backcourt 
combined to force multiple shot-
clock violations. Michigan was 
finally dominating the game 
the way it had been expected 
to from the start. Going into 
the half, leading 31-22, the 
Wolverines had what they had 
lacked for much of the first half: 
momentum.
“It’s just about being more 
aggressive 
in 
transition,” 
DeJulius said. “We’re not trying 
to make any home runs – we’re 
just trying to make singles and 
doubles.”
From there, they didn’t look 
back, as the defense continued 
to 
stifle 
the 
Phoenix 
and 
Michigan’s 
shots 
found 
net 

instead of rim. The Wolverines 
finally made as much of their 
size advantage on offense as 
they had been doing on defense, 
physically overpowering Elon 
and outscoring it, 39-28, in the 
second half. 
Defensively, 
Michigan 
remained solid throughout the 
second half, holding the Phoenix 
to longer scoring droughts and 
forcing them into uncomfortable 
shots.
In the end, it wasn’t close. 
But for a long time, it was 
closer than it maybe should’ve 
been.
“It was a competitive game, 
and it was supposed to be that 
way,” Howard said. “It was never 
supposed to be an easy game. 
We’re never going to have an 
easy game.”

New coach, new system.
There was always going to be 
a bit of a learning curve, and an 
injury to freshman guard Franz 
Wagner, heralded as one of the 
most exciting players coming to 
Ann Arbor this year, wasn’t going 
to help things. 
There were signs of that in 
the highs and lows exposed in 
the offense in last week’s season-
opening victory over Appalachian 
State, a game the Wolverines led 
by 30 but only won by eight.
But the first half of Friday’s 
game against Elon was perhaps 
even more convincing evidence. 
Michigan trailed for much of the 
first quarter or so of the game. The 

Wolverines didn’t score until two 
minutes in, and didn’t lead until 
five minutes in, a lead they quickly 
gave up two short minutes later.
For much of the first half, the 
offense just was not functioning. 
What limited passing was going 
on was sloppy and often through 
traffic. No matter where on the 
court they were coming from, the 
shots were not falling. Michigan 
could not find a rhythm on the 
offensive end of the court.
“Every possession matters,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 
Juwan 
Howard. “You could see that 
tonight. Every possession counts. 
We fought. From start to finish. 
The first half – it was a slugfest.”
Some of these offensive troubles 
were 
almost 
expected. 
The 
departures of Jordan Poole, Ignas 
Brazdeikis and, most importantly, 

John Beilein rocked this Michigan 
program, and the integration of a 
new system with new head coach 
Juwan Howard was always going 
to be a bit of a process.
But six weeks into practice, 
and with increasing in-game 
experience for this fairly young 
team, these are the issues that 
should be beginning to smooth 
out.
“It’s more ball movement – 
more player ball movement,” 
Howard said. “There were shots, 
open shots, that didn’t go down, 
but we have to have that next-play 
mentality. We can’t start making 
a compound mistake where we’re 
thinking about our offense, and 
the ball’s not going in.”
If these Wolverines are going 
to be the competitor they say they 
are, the contender they believe 
they are, at both the conference 
and national levels, a moment of 
truth, or at least a bigger test, a 
bigger challenge, is not that far 
down the road. After a challenging 
trip to Atlantis over Thanksgiving, 
Michigan will travel to No. 4 
Louisville in a little more than two 
weeks to start off a demanding 
four-game stretch in which the 
Wolverines will face strong Iowa 
and Illinois squads and a very 
dangerous Oregon team – all in 
the span of a week.
Against Elon, those mistakes 
were affordable, if far from ideal. 
Against teams of the caliber 
Michigan will face this season – 
with the likes of Michigan State 
looking to dominate the Big Ten 
– they will not be. The conference 
schedule is not that far off, and 
with the field shaping up the way 
it is, Michigan does not have a lot 
of time to find some answers – and 
some rhythm – on offense. 
“It’s just, as we watch film, 
seeing ways we can be more 
aggressive,” 
said 
sophomore 
guard 
David 
DeJulius. 
“Not 
just for ourselves, but ways we 
can penetrate and get it to my 
teammates in places where they 
can do something, too.”

‘M’ outlasts Kent State, 
80-71, staying unbeaten 

Michigan just went on a 8-1 
run, hitting layup after layup, 
dominating 
the 
inside 
and 
creating a seven-point lead. But 
just as the momentum seemed 
to pivot back in the direction 
of 
the 
Wolverines, 
quick 
3-pointers and turnovers from 
sophomore guard Amy Dilk 
compounded into a 10-point 
swing for Akron. 
Michigan trailed 
in a game for the 
first 
time 
all 
season.
The 
blows 
dealt 
by 
both 
teams in the last 
five minutes of 
the third quarter 
resembled 
the rest of the 
matchup, a tie 
that ended with the Michigan 
women’s basketball team (4-0) 
grabbing the last swing of 
momentum, beating the Zips, 
80-71.
For 
Michigan, 
everything 
was 
working 
inside, 
and 
everything 
went 
through 
Naz Hillmon. The sophomore 
forward ended the game with 
28 points and eight rebounds, 
going 10-for-11 from the free 
throw line. She also showed 
her ability to transition playing 
styles midgame, beginning the 
game dominating the paint, 
Akron 
transitioned 
in 
an 
attempt to stop her.
“It was more about how they 
were playing us, they started 
to pack it in a little bit to limit 
the space all around the floor,” 
Hillmon 
said. 
“Being 
able 
to space out and take those 
shots, I was able to open up my 
teammates for shots. So really 
try to space the floor and adjust 
based on their adjustments they 
made on packing the paint a 
bit.”
With Hillmon’s dominance 
inside, the Wolverines found 
themselves shooting from the 
paint at an impressive clip, 
hitting 70 percent of their 

shots, as well as getting to the 
free throw line and gathering 
vital points as the team went 
22-for-25 from the line.
Despite 
the 
efficiency 
of Michigan’s shots, Akron 
managed to hang around and 
threaten the Wolverines with 
their 
threes, 
shooting 
40 
percent from beyond the arc.
“We 
didn’t 
really 
make 
threes tonight,” said Michigan 
coach Kim Barnes Arico. “We 
didn’t 
really 
shoot 
threes 
tonight, so we 
had to make up 
those points in 
different 
ways, 
especially when 
a team makes the 
amount of threes 
that 
they 
did 
tonight, and I 
thought we were 
able to do that by 
being aggressive and getting to 
the free throw line. … We were 
trading threes for twos.”
The 
Zips’ 
ranged 
attack 
became even more dangerous 
when Michigan made mistakes 
and 
gave 
up 
possessions. 
Totaling seventeen turnovers, 
the 
Wolverines’ 
momentum 
would often die as soon as it 
began.
Sophomore guard Amy Dilk 
accounted for the plurality of 
turnovers on the team, with 
eight total, giving Akron an 
opportunity to score points on 
the fast break.
“(Dilk’s) a player, like you 
said, that she changes pace, she 
controls the game and when she 
goes, we go,” Barnes Arico said. 
“She had a couple of flubs there 
and that’s when they went on 
their run.”
Yet, when their back was 
against the wall — when the 
Zips took the lead — Michigan 
locked down and didn’t blink. 
Junior forward Hailey Brown 
came to life in the fourth 
quarter, scoring the only two 
three-pointers of the day for 
the team.
The Wolverines outscored 
Akron 25-13 in the fourth 

quarter, clamping down on 
defense, so that when Brown 
nailed her three-pointer at 
the seven-minute mark, the 
game felt over at 67-61, the 
momentum was Michigan’s.

alking through the 
Michigan Stadium 
concourse at about 
3:50 on Satur-
day, you could 
hear it before 
you saw it.
“It’s great 
to be a Michi-
gan Wolver-
ine,” they 
chanted, and 
the chants 
came from no 
one direction, 
just every-
where. 
It was minutes after the Michi-
gan football team kneeled down 
to put the finishing touches on a 
44-10 beatdown of Michigan State, 
with Shea Patterson running the 
game ball to Jim Harbaugh, and 
minutes before Harbaugh told the 
assembled media that he stuffed 
the ball back into Patterson’s book 
bag, a token of appreciation for a 
384-yard, four-touchdown perfor-
mance, Patterson’s best in a Michi-
gan uniform. 
It was two days after, trailing 
by one against the Spartans with 
a power play coming midway 
through the third period, junior 
forward Mike Pastujov got called 
for roughing, negating the Wolver-
ines’ best chance at pulling back in 
a 4-3 loss. 
It was hours before the Michi-
gan State hockey team would skate 
over to its student section in the 
corner of Munn Ice Arena and 
pound on the glass after a 3-0 win, 
basking in chants of their own, 
that in the game’s last three min-
utes went from “Board the Buses,” 
to “Fuck Jim Harbaugh,” and 
finally, “Little Sister.”
It was one moment in a week-
end full of them, and it encap-
sulated everything about the 
Michigan-Michigan State rivalry.
There are separate repercus-
sions on all sides for all of these 
games. Michigan football got a 
highlight in what seemed poised to 
be a lost season. Michigan hockey 
fell further back on its heels, then 
got kicked into the dirt. But this 
is not a platform to try and mix 
football and hockey analysis. It’s 
one to dissect a rivalry, and what it 
means to the people in it.
Like senior safety Josh 
Metellus, from Florida and indoc-
trinated into this, who waved 
at the Spartans when the final 
whistle blew and later explained, 

“I was telling them to go home. It’s 
time for them to leave. They don’t 
deserve to be in this stadium.”
Like sophomore defenseman 
Nick Blankenburg, from Washing-
ton, Mich., who does need need 
the rivalry contextualized and 
who stood in the offices at Yost 
Ice Arena on Thursday after his 
team threw away a 3-1 lead, arms 
crossed and frowning. “We just let 
off the gas,” he said, a cardinal sin 
in this rivalry.
Like Mel Pearson, who has 
coached in this game in some form 
for a combined 26 years, who took 
a long walk to center ice on Sat-
urday and shook Michigan State 
coach Danton Cole’s hand, then 
trudged to the end of the hand-
shake line. He stood in a hallway 
behind the bench 15 minutes later, 
his hands on his hips, and said 
of Michigan’s power play, which 
went 0-for-8 on the weekend, all 
but costing the Wolverines two 
games, “We’re terrible there. 
We’re absolutely terrible.”
Like athletic director Warde 
Manuel, who sent a co-signed let-
ter with Michigan State athletic 
director Bill Beekman to fans 
on Friday imploring respectful 
behavior at the football game. That 
got thrown out the window along 
with a few thousand yellow towels 
that rained down on Nico Collins 
after he waltzed into the end zone 
on a 22-yard post route early in 
the fourth quarter, making the 
score 34-10 and making a crowd of 
111,496 lose its collective mind.
Like Harbaugh, the public face 
of Michigan athletics, who cried in 
the Spartan Stadium locker room 
a year ago after the Wolverines 
beat the Spartans. On Saturday, he 
only used one word to describe his 
emotions. “Happy. Really happy,” 
he said. “It’s a big game, it’s for the 
state championship. 112th version. 
And now our team, everybody 
that’s in the locker room has the 
advantage. Fifth-year seniors 

are 3-2. The seniors are 3-1. The 
juniors are 2-1. Sophomores are 
2-0 and the freshmen are 1-0. 
That’s a big program win. Makes 
me very happy.”
This is stereotyped as a chippy, 
physical matchup, and rightfully 
so. The two football teams had 
five combined unsportsmanlike 
conduct penalties, two personal 
fouls and an ejection, imposed on 
Michigan State defensive lineman 
Jacub Panasiuk after a blatant 
cheap shot on Patterson. Thurs-
day’s hockey game featured a fight 
after Michigan State defenseman 
Christian Krygier cross-checked 
Jake Slaker. Sophomore defense-
man Jack Summers jumped on 
Krygier, whose twin brother, Cole, 
started punching Slaker. 
There is real, visceral hatred 
on all sides. And with that comes 
emotion, the two extremes dis-
played across sports and across 
the weekend.
“You never want to be in this 
situation, losing games,” said 
senior defenseman Griffin Luce 
Saturday night, sweat still drip-
ping and skates still on. “... I 
wouldn’t say we’re panicking here, 
we’re not worried, but day-to-day, 
we just have to bring it every day 
as a team.”
Forty-nine miles away and a 
few hours earlier, Metellus was at 
a podium with cameras trained 
on him, expressing the exact 
opposite.
“I’m pretty pleased,” Metellus 
said, “because I feel like we’re way 
more classier than them. They try 
to take it to a level that wasn’t play-
ing football. We play football over 
here. I don’t know what they do 
over there, but we play football.”
That’s what this rivalry is, 
and that’s what it always will be. 
Whether you’re in the Michigan 
Stadium concourse, the bowels of 
Munn Ice Arena or anywhere in 
between, it only takes a moment 
to see it.

A weekend inside the rivalry

ETHAN
SEARS

Spartans crush ‘M,’ 3-0, for sweep

EAST 
LANSING 
— 
Kris 
Mayotte turned to Mel Pearson 
on the bench, and with a grim 
expression on his face, the 
assistant coach — in charge of 
goaltending — shouted one word, 
or rather, one name.
“Hayden!”
Pearson 
had 
presumed 
Mayotte wanted to discuss the 
goal Strauss Mann had just 
allowed, his third of the night. But 
when a second shout of Hayden 
Lavigne’s name came, without 
another thought, Pearson cued 
the switch of goaltenders — a 
“no-brainer” he later called the 
decision.
Pulling 
a 
goaltender 
is 
indicative of only one thing. A 
team is struggling to stop shots, 
and that a change is needed. 
And for the Michigan hockey 
team, that meant that its recent 
struggles to stop pucks against 
Michigan State had continued 
onto Saturday’s matchup that 
resulted in a 3-0 loss — leading 
the team to turn to Lavigne. 
“You’re just trying to change 
the tempo of the game a little bit,” 
Pearson said.
The decision came too late, 
though. The switch didn’t remove 
the fact that the Wolverines had 
dug themselves into a three-goal 

hole. Or that any offensive pushes 
resulted in a glaring zero on 
Michigan’s side of the scoreboard. 
The goaltender change was just a 
change of pace, a gamble to spark 
energy amongst the deflated 
Wolverines.
“We’re just not getting many 
breaks,” Pearson said. “You have 
to make your breaks”
The despair built from the 
three goals that 
were 
allowed 
early. A tipped 
shot in front of 
the crease in the 
first 
period 
is 
a difficult task 
to 
ask 
anyone 
to save. Add in 
two 
screens, 
and the task was 
impossible 
for 
Mann. 
But the blame for the second 
and third goals, however, laid 
largely on Mann’s shoulders. 
A shot from Austin Kamar off 
a faceoff win snuck between 
Mann’s glove and leg pad, and 
diminished 
any 
momentum 
the Wolverines had built from 
their relentless second-period 
attacks. And a third goal, minutes 
later from Tommy Apap after 
a persistent crease attack — a 
top-shelf shot on a rebound after 
three saves — sent Michigan into 
a state of dismay.

It wasn’t just the relative 
ease that Michigan State scored 
with, it was the difficulty that 
came with every high-danger 
scoring chance the Wolverines 
produced. In the second period, 
sophomore 
forward 
Jimmy 
Lambert conducted a three-on-
one breakaway that fizzled out 
without a single shot on goal.
“You see it on the bench, 
when you get a three-on-one like 
Jimmy had and we don’t even get 
a shot, you can just see it on the 
bench, like, ‘What do we have 
to do?’ ” Pearson said. “And it 
gets frustrating, and they’re all 
frustrated right now.”
Sensing the frustration, the 
switch was called, and a timeout, 
too, as insurance.
The message in the 60 seconds 
was clear. Stay with it. Keep 
playing hard. There was plenty of 
time left in the game.
The 
revitalized 
efforts 
didn’t procure any goals, but 
opportunities 
came, 
which 
couldn’t be said about much of 
the first period, and the latter half 
of the second. And in all three 
periods, the lack of opportunities 
on the power play 
further doomed 
Michigan.
Converting 
0-of-5 
power 
plays, the man-
advantage 
proved to be a 
non-factor when 
its 
inherent 
purpose 
is 
to 
provide 
teams 
with an increased 
chance to score.
“We have two opportunities 
in the first period,” Pearson said. 
“And we have the chance to do 
some things and we’re terrible 
there, we’re absolutely terrible 
there.
“... You have guys who aren’t 
finishing and really struggling 
offensively, they go hand and 
hand, the power play and (even-
strength scoring).”
And those problems are not 
things a simple goaltender change 
can fix.

Sophomore goaltender Strauss Mann got pulled on Saturday for Hayden Lavigne.

You can see it 
on the bench 
like, “What do 
we have to do?”

Michigan unable to respond to deficit

EAST LANSING — It took just 
under two minutes for the game to 
completely slip away.
In those brief 104 seconds, the 
Michigan hockey team collapsed. 
But 
it 
wouldn’t 
show 
immediately. Entering the second 
period, the Wolverines were riding 
a wave of momentum. They showed 
no signs of having surrendered a 
goal in the opening minutes of the 
first period. Their play was sharp. 
The offense displayed urgency. 
Every puck that connected with a 
Michigan stick went towards the 
net. 
“We were all over them,” said 
senior defenseman Griffin Luce. 
“They couldn’t hang with us, they 
couldn’t play with us. They get the 
first goal there and I think we did 
a pretty good job answering. They 
didn’t know what hit them.”
But no matter how potent their 
second-period start was, there 
was still the fact that the first goal, 
scored in the opening minutes, 
was, ultimately, the game-winner.
When Luce was asked about the 
team’s response to the early goal, 
he pointed to the team’s intensity 
in the second period. But there 
was still 18 minutes between the 
goal and the “strong response” 
unaccounted for. Because in those 
18 minutes, there was little to point 
to. 
Little 
improvement. 
Little 
upswing 
in 
intensity. 
Little 

response to show for a team that 
needs to start learning to handle 
the adversity it faces. 
Because as quickly as everything 
seemed to be going right for the 
Wolverines in the second period, 
everything began to go wrong.
It started with senior forward 
Nick Pastujov losing a faceoff in 
the defensive zone. Michigan State 
forward Adam Goodsir won the 
draw and slid the puck behind him 
to forward Austin Kamer. Kamer 
released the puck within a second 
of receiving it, connected with the 
back of the net and then the buzzer 
sounded. 
Michigan had fallen into a 2-0 
deficit, but the bleeding didn’t stop.
Immediately after the goal, there 
was no pushback, similar to the 18 
minutes after the first Spartan goal. 
The Wolverines seemed deflated, 
and more obviously, frustrated.
Sticks were slammed. Heads 
were shaken. It didn’t matter that 
almost half the game still remained, 
Michigan was playing like a team 
that had already lost. And rather 
than responding immediately to 
Michigan State’s second goal — 
exactly what the Wolverines had 
failed to after falling behind 1-0 — 
they faltered.
“They just fought a little harder 
in those gritty areas to score those 
goals,” said Michigan coach Mel 
Pearson. “That’s what (we’ve been) 
talking about. We’ve got to play a 
little harder there.”
The lack of response by the 
Wolverines resulted in an even 

stronger push from Michigan 
State.
One 
minute 
later, 
Spartan 
forward Jagger Joshua pushed the 
puck past freshman defenseman 
Keaton Pherson to gain the 
offensive zone. Joshua fired a rising 
shot towards the net, but freshman 
forward Johnny Beecher batted 
the puck out of the air.
Beecher’s play was followed by 
a scramble for the puck in front of 
the net, and sophomore goaltender 
Strauss Mann was forced to make 
a series of saves. One of the saves 
left him vulnerable, Mann was 
stomach down on the ice, sprawled 
across his crease. 
When the puck came found the 
stick of Michigan State forward 
Tommy Apap, it was too easy. The 
net was wide open, and he buried 
the puck top shelf.
The game had gone from bad to 
worse to over. The Wolverines had 
fallen into a three-goal hole they 
were unable to climb out of against 
the Spartans. 
The team was rattled because for 
the first time in a string of games, 
Michigan’s biggest problem wasn’t 
their offense — it was everything.
And the response to the third 
goal wasn’t a rally or a harder 
press or anything effort-based. It 
was a personnel change. Trying 
to provide a spark for his team, 
Pearson pulled Mann from goal 
and replaced him with senior 
goaltender Hayden Lavigne, who 
had yet to see ice time in a game 
this season. Pearson followed the 
swap with a timeout to regroup the 
team.
“It just gives a little boost there 
for us,” Luce said. “It just gets guys 
on their toes a little bit. So we can 
go and get right back on it. He’s 
coming in cold so you never wanna 
give him any chances early right 
away.”
But it didn’t have the effect 
Pearson intended. In the wake of 
those two goals, the Wolverines 
would never regain control of the 
game, and there were no shortage 
of chances to do so.
The opening two minutes of the 
game, and the 104-second stretch of 
play in the second period had done 
too much damage, and Michigan 
showed just how incapable it is of 
immediately responding to falling 
behind in a game.
