The University of Michigan’s 
Board of Regents passed the 
administration’s 2020-21 budget 
in a 5-2 vote during a special 
meeting Monday night, days 
after a 4-4 vote at their June 25 
meeting had appeared to sink 
proposed increases in tuition 
and fees. The approved budget 
includes a 1.9 percent increase 
in tuition for the Ann Arbor 
campus; a 3.9 percent increase 
for UM-Flint and UM-Dearborn; 
a 1.9 percent increase in room 
and board fees and a $50 COVID-
19 student fee. 
 Regents Paul Brown (D), 
Jordan Acker (D), Ron Weiser 
(R), Mark Bernstein (D) and 
Michael Behm (D) voted in favor 
of the budget, with Brown and 
Acker changing their votes from 
Thursday. Regents Shauna Ryder 
Diggs (D) and Denise Ilitch (D) 
voted against the budget. Regent 
Katherine White (D) was not 
present, though she called in to 
vote for the proposed budget at 
the previous meeting.
 After the budget initially 
failed to pass on June 25, 

University 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel said he anticipated the 
budget proposal the executive 
team would present at the July 
Regents meeting would diminish 
or eliminate a tuition increase for 
the Ann Arbor campus.
 Schlissel explained that the 
Board called for the special 
meeting on Monday because, 
without a budget, the University 
would not be able to operate and 
continue paying employees in 
the new fiscal year, starting July 
1. Half of the revenue from the 
tuition increase will go toward 
increasing 
financial 
aid 
to 
address the pandemic, according 
to Schlissel, and the new budget 
also doubled the funds provided 
to Flint and Dearborn campuses 
from $10 million to $20 million. 
Schlissel 
defended 
the 
proposal 
and 
cited 
the 
University’s ongoing efforts to 
protect students and families 
from the pandemic and economic 
recession 
including 
COVID-
19 testing, hiring freezes, the 
suspension of nonessential travel 
and spending, and the use of $400 
million from the endowment.
“We’re committed to do 
our very best to make sure that 
the COVID-19 pandemic does 
not result in a lost generation 
of students who are unable 
to continue or complete their 

Michigan 
education 
because 
of the circumstances we find 
ourselves in,” Schlissel said. 
Students have criticized the 
University for trying to increase 
tuition, claiming their learning 
experiences will not be the same 
with online classes and more 
students are now struggling 
financially due to the recession 
sparked by the pandemic.
After Schlissel’s introduction, 
most of the meeting was devoted 
to 
Regents 
explaining 
their 
support for or disapproval of the 
budget.
Weiser, who supported the 
budget last Thursday and on 
Monday, 
addressed 
demands 
made by students and activists to 
use the endowment to balance the 
budget and cover financial losses. 
He said much of the endowment 
funds are restricted to particular 
units of the University and thus 
cannot be redirected legally.
 “While we are a university 
that’s blessed by having an 
endowment that’s gonna give 
us 400 million dollars this year, 
most of that money is restricted 
to certain areas,” Weiser said. “… 
It’s not a 12 million (sic) dollar 
endowment where we can take 
the income and spread it, put it

Regents approve new budget with 
tuition increase in special meeting

Dominick Sokotoff/Daily

On 
June 
12, 
the 
Trump 
administration announced a rollback 
of 
Obama-era 
anti-discrimination 
policies for trans and nonbinary people 
in the healthcare system. According to 
a statement from the Department of 
Health and Human Services, the federal 
government will no longer recognize 
gender identity as protected categories 
under the civil rights section of the 
Affordable Care Act, and will curb the 
interpretation of “sex” to pertain only 
to “the plain meaning of the word” as 
“male or female and as determined by 
biology.”
Three days later, the Supreme Court 
followed with its own ruling on sex 
discrimination in employment, arguing 
sex discrimination does encompass 
discrimination on the basis of sexual 
orientation and gender identity. These 
seemingly contrasting federal rulings 
have raised questions in terms of what 
that ultimately means for trans and 
nonbinary people’s rights. 
LSA junior Hazel Gordon voiced 
her concerns to The Daily in the wake 
of the Trump administration’s ruling, 
stating that trans discrimination in 
this country is not necessarily new, but 
explicit government backing for it is.
“It is worth noting that it does 
happen already,” Gordon said. “This 
just provides, I guess, legal backing 
for it … I think it opens up a lot of 
already vulnerable people to further 
discrimination.”
Gordon, who identifies as a trans 
woman, said the Supreme Court’s 
decision is a sign of progress, on the 
other hand, but shouldn’t be met 
without 
skepticism, 
especially

The University of Michigan 
hosted a virtual town hall titled 
“Constructive Conversations for 
Societal Change” on Friday, in soli-
darity with the protests that have 
erupted across the nation against 
racism and police brutality. The 
town hall was moderated by Rob-
ert M. Sellers, vice provost of equity 
and inclusion and chief diversity 
officer, and focused on providing a 
platform for the University of Mich-
igan community to come together.
“Our conversation today marks 
our collective recommitment as 
individuals and as a university to 
ending systemic racism in our soci-
ety and within our institution,” 
Sellers said. “In doing so, we affirm 
that Black lives matter. We recog-
nize that this conversation is not the 
solution, nor can it be our response, 
our only response, to the senseless 
killing of George Floyd and far too 
many other African Americans. It’s 
only a necessary start to acknow-
ledging our collective pain and out-
rage.”
LSA senior Darlena York shared 
her experiences with racism on 
campus, citing a survey from a pol-
itical science class she took and the 
effect of the survey on students’ 
mental health. 
“It makes students not want to 
participate in class, not want to 
go to class, because it’s very detri-
mental to our mental health, detri-
mental to how we want to perform 
in class and it’s detrimental to our 
overall well-being as students,” 
York said. “A lot of my experiences 
aren’t that positive when reflecting 
on racial inequality on campus. It’s 
very exhausting as a student lead-
er sometimes, having to constantly 
combat those things.”
Rackham student Naomi Mae 
Wilson, who has been a commun-
ity organizer for the past 10 years, 
spoke about her involvement in 
fighting systemic racism at the 
University of California at Berke-

ley, New York University and in 
her communities at the University 
of Michigan. She emphasized that 
fighting for change can be exhaust-
ing and traumatic.
“Having been in the work for 10 
years, it’s not really, really long but 
it’s a lot for me. My experience and 
my feelings are both exhaustion and 
also a deep, deep fire in my spirit to 
fight for justice and to make sure 
that we have change,” Wilson said. 
“Young people are out there and 
they are dedicating their childhoods 
for justice which in some ways, in a 
lot of ways, is beautiful and in a lot 
of ways is incredibly sad that we 
lift up these young folks who are 
out there, to march and demand for 
their lives to matter.”
Riana Anderson, an assistant 
professor at the School of Pub-
lic Health, spoke about the link 
between systemic racism and the 
disparate impact of COVID-19 
on the Black community and the 
effects of the protests on mental 
and physical health, making people 
more susceptible to the dangers of 
COVID-19.
“My work shows how racial acts 
exact a toll on psychological out-
comes like anxiety, depression and 
trauma, even if it’s not personally 
happening to us, as is the case with 
so many of the virtual experiences 
we viewed online,” Anderson said. 
“Our bodies also react through 
physiological 
processes, 
like 
increased blood pressure, quick-
ened heart rate and heightened 
production of stress hormones, 
eroding our physical health and 
wreaking havoc on our normal 
stress responses including regulat-
ed breathing, which of course ties 
back to COVID.”
Eddie L. Washington Jr., the 
executive director of the Division of 
Public Safety and Security, shared 
his emotional reaction to the video 
of George Floyd’s murder.
“When I saw the video, the first 
thing I thought about was just the 
loss of life. And I think about the 
loss of life and the impacts that that 
has directly on (Floyd’s) family, on 
the community, on Blacks specific-
ally,” Washington Jr. said. “It causes 
a spark of images that I think about 
for most of my life, images from 
the 60s and the 70s. I think about

Students flock to 
bars after reopening

The challenges that international 
students face in attending American 
universities are plentiful, ranging 
from intense culture shock to rising 
tuition fees. Add the COVID-19 
pandemic, which comes with strict 
travel 
restrictions, 
troublesome 
flights home and visa issues, and 
those challenges double.
The University’s International 
Center Director Judith Pennywell 
told the Daily that over the past 
few 
months, 
the 
center 
has 
received numerous requests for 
help regarding the pandemic and 
uncertainty for the fall semester. 
“Students are wondering about 
the availability of remote learning 
opportunities for fall and whether 
there are visa or immigration related 
implications,” 
Pennywell 
said. 
“Some students have expressed 
concerns about internship offers 
being revoked in light of COVID-19.”
Second-year Information student 
Chengyue Qiu, an international 
student 
from 
China 
and 
the 
secretary for Graduate Rackham 
International (GRIN), a student-
run organization at the University 
meant to support graduate students 
on campus, mentioned how since the 
pandemic hit, her peers have faced 
both academic and career obstacles.
“I have a lot of friends who had 
their internships canceled because 

of COVID,” Qiu said. “That’s a really 
common thing.”
Engineering alum Mohammed 
Majid had his offer as an upcoming 
software engineer at Uber rescinded 
due to the pandemic. Majid, an 
international student from India, 
shared his story on a LinkedIn post 
that spread widely throughout the 
University community.
“Hi Everyone!” the post begins. 
“Yesterday, I received a phone call 
from my recruiter: my new grad 
SWE offer from Uber was rescinded 
due to COVID-19, with 90 days 
left to find employment or risk 
deportation.”
Upon graduation, international 
students who do not want to 
return home usually apply for 
Optional Practice Training, which 
allows students to stay in the U.S. 
for a maximum of 12 months for 
employment-related training in their 
field of study. But not all companies 
choose to sponsor international 
students and some organizations 
related to defense or national 
security seldom hire or interview 
non-U.S. citizens. Students who are 
granted OPT are only allotted 90 
days of unemployment. 
In an interview with The Daily, 
Majid spoke about the grueling fall 
job recruitment process and how 
difficult it was to do it all over again 
last month. Back in September, 
he said he applied to as many as 
100 jobs and by November had a 
couple of offers — three months 
of applications, phone calls and 
interviews.

While 
many 
University 
of 
Michigan students use the sum-
mer months to gain experience 
from internships and jobs, others 
engage in various research proj-
ects across campus to gain criti-
cal skills for career development. 
But in a matter of weeks, those 
plans to participate in cutting-
edge research at the No. 1 public 
research university in the U.S. 
were halted as the COVID-19 pan-
demic shut down all non-essential 
in-person research activity.
Since then, the University has 
started ramping up non-essential 
research. Furthermore, members 
of the research community have 
begun to resume in-person lab 
work in phases, while following 
procedures to protect the health 
and safety of researchers. How-
ever, undergraduate students, who 
are heavily involved in many labs 
across campus, are still restrict-
ed from returning to labs under 
Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s current 
guidelines, which classifies under-
graduate students as “non-essen-
tial in-person visitors.” 
LSA 
sophomore 
Kylie 
Sch-
ache, a UROP student during the 
school year, said she was planning 
on working in a lab that studies 
Alzheimer’s disease for the sum-
mer. The lab work was a full-time 
paying position in which she would 
work 40 to 50 hours per week. 
These plans, however, came to 
a halt when COVID-19 prevented 
undergraduates from returning to 
labs –– and it doesn’t seem like this 
will change anytime soon, Sch-
ache said. As a result, Schache said 
she is considering taking a semes-
ter off to gain additional research 
experience at the University in 
hopes of preparing her for a career 
in research.
“I’m actually considering that 
I might need to take a gap semes-
ter,” Schache said. “The fact that 
the University of Michigan is the 
number one public research uni-
versity is the primary reason why 

I chose to attend there and really 
the definitive reason why I’m will-
ing to attend the most expensive 
public university in the United 
States. So the loss of research 
opportunities kind of called into 
question whether attending the 
University merits the cost at this 
point. I can take the classes and I 
can get the degrees, but ultimate-
ly what’s going to prepare me for 
what I want to do with my career 
— which I want to do a career in 
research — it’s the research oppor-
tunities that are most important.”
University spokeswoman Kim 
Broekhuizen reaffirmed in an 
email to The Daily that under-
graduates are unable to partici-
pate in laboratory research at 
this time due to Whitmer’s latest 
executive order. Broekhuizen also 
noted the University’s efforts to 
develop principles to protect the 
health and safety of researchers 
as they begin to resume work amid 
COVID-19. 
“The university must adhere to 
state regulations, and so we will 
closely monitor any updates to 
the governor’s executive order as 
it relates to laboratory research,” 
Broekhuizen wrote.
As of June 26, the University 
completed the laboratory research 
re-engagement waves, and more 
than 95 percent of the University’s 
lab workforce is now re-engaged, 
according to an update from 
Rebeccca Cunningham, vice presi-
dent for research. While research-
ers continue to resume in-person 
activity, labs are to remain operat-
ing at about 30 percent capacity at 
any given shift.
Gary Luker, professor of radiolo-
gy, biomedical engineering, micro-
biology and immunology, conducts 
research focusing on molecular 
imaging of cell signaling in can-
cer. Over the course of his entire 
time working in the lab, Luker has 
had roughly 35 to 40 undergradu-
ate students participate in their 
research.

A proposal to increase tuition 
by 1.9 percent for the 2020-2021 
school year and add an additional 
$50 COVID-19 student fee failed to 
pass at the University of Michigan 
Board of Regents meeting Thurs-
day morning. The decision was 
widely talked about by students 
on social media, with many saying 
they were shocked by the Univer-
sity’s attempt to raise tuition, espe-
cially since the majority of students 
in a representative survey of the 
student body said they expected a 
tuition discount.
University 
spokesman 
Rick 
Fitzgerald described the motiva-
tion behind the proposed 1.9 per-
cent increase in tuition in an email 
to The Daily. 
“The administration proposed 
a 1.9 percent tuition increase on 
the Ann Arbor campus to balance 
the budget, provide higher levels 
of financial aid, and adapt to the 
COVID-19 pandemic,” Fitzgerald 
wrote. “The budget also included 
continuing the Go Blue Guaran-
tee and contained a 5.6 percent 
increase in undergraduate finan-
cial aid. That additional $12.8 mil-
lion increase in aid would have 
meant most in-state undergradu-
ates receiving need-based grant 
aid would have seen no increase in 
tuition costs in the coming year.”
University tuition and fees have 
increased 42.05 percent for the last 
10 years, including the same 1.9 
percent last year for in-state under-

graduates and 3.7 percent for out-
of-state undergraduates. University 
President Mark Schlissel has noted 
this trend in rising tuition is to 
maintain the University’s commit-
ment to academic excellence, espe-
cially as inadequate state funding 
for higher education continues to 
decrease. This year, as Michigan 
struggles with coronavirus, state 
appropriations are likely to be fur-
ther reduced as the state faces a 
$3.2 billion budget deficit. 
“The university has long been 
committed 
to 
affordability,” 
Fitzgerald wrote. “Significant uni-
versity 
resources 
are 
directed 
toward financial aid. Last fiscal 
year, we provided $344 million in 
grant and scholarship support for 
students. Only 1 percent of that 
support was directly funded by the 
state, 10 percent by federal sources, 
and 6 percent by private sources. 
The remaining 83 percent was from 
university 
resources, 
including 
general fund, endowment support 
and athletics.”
Though students have lamented 
tuition increases in the past, this 
year’s strong opposition centers 
around students hesitant to pay 
increased tuition without receiv-
ing the full benefits of in-person 
instruction. Though the Univer-
sity’s recently released decision 
describes their plan as an “in-res-
idence, public-health informed” 
fall semester, all classes of over 50 
people will be held online, and each 
department and school will make 
the final determination.
Last month, some students filed 
a lawsuit seeking compensation for 
the move to online classes in March. 
The University said they do not 
owe students money for switching 
formats due to academic freedom 
principles that give the University 
alone the power to decide mode of 

instruction.
Additionally, LSA sophomore 
Becca Stachel told The Daily that 
tuition is already a huge obstacle 
for many students attending the 
University. Stachel finds it difficult 
to justify paying the same tuition 
for online classes in the fall, espe-
cially for students impacted most 
by COVID-19.
“A lot of people aren’t financially 
stable (after the pandemic) and 
tuition is a huge burden on a lot of 
students,” Stachel said. “So, to have 
a lesser quality of education, but 
still have to pay the same amount 
of money when you likely also took 
pay cuts because of the pandemic, 
seems unfair to me.”
In early June, Central Student 
Government members Public Poli-
cy senior Damian Chessare, Rack-
ham student Hayden Jackson and 
Architecture student Lauren Con-
roy put together a survey gauging 
student sentiment on tuition and 
enrollment in light of the COVID-
19 pandemic. Their report found 
the majority of students surveyed 
expected a tuition discount of just 
under 20 percent to be acceptable if 
classes were in a hybrid format. 
59.4 percent of the students 
surveyed said a discount decision 
would affect their enrollment deci-
sions at least a moderate amount. 
Over 40 percent projected that 
their future financial circumstanc-
es were either “very insecure” or 
“somewhat insecure.” 
LSA junior Annie Mintun, a LSA 
representative to CSG, created a 
petition calling for the University 
to decrease tuition after Thurs-
day’s Regents meeting. As of Friday 
afternoon, the petition has over 
2700 signatures.

Survey data shows a

whitewashed and misunderstood, yet 
are somewhat collectively acknowl-
edged as the origin of Pride Month. 
There continues to be major dispari-
ties in rights for the trans community, 
especially in medical care. There is a 
higher prevalence of clinical depression, 
anxiety, somatization, current smokers, 
former alcohol or drug use to cope with 
mistreatment and attempted suicides. 
According to the 2015 U.S. Transgender 
Survey, about a third of trans respon-
dents reported having a negative experi-
ence in the previous year with a health 
insurance provider related to being 
trans. Also, as a result of America’s his-
tory of muting the contributions made by 
Black trans women for modern LGBTQ+ 
rights and silencing these women’s voic-
es, Black trans women struggle the most 
in the trans community. Over a quarter 
of Black trans respondents reported 
avoiding a healthcare provider when 
they needed it in the past year due to fear 
of mistreatment and 40 percent reported 
avoiding a healthcare provider because 
they could not afford it. About 20 percent 
of Black trans individuals are uninsured, 
compared to 14 percent of trans people 
overall and 11 percent of the total U.S. 
population. Over 40 percent of Black 
trans individuals reported experiencing 
recent psychological distress, over eight 
times the rate of the U.S. population. 
Black trans individuals also reported 
higher rates of suicide attempts. 
At the same time, Black trans 
individuals reported experiencing 
elevated rates of discrimination and 
verbal, physical and sexual assault at 
the hands of police officers. Overall, 
22 percent of trans people who have 
interacted with police have reported 
police harassment, which jumps to 
38 percent for trans people who 
are Black. These high numbers 
strongly point to implicit bias 
law enforcement holds against 
both trans and Black individu-
als, and makes it no surprise that 
many trans individuals and Black 
LGBTQ+ individuals, in particu-
lar, do not want police presence 
at Pride celebrations and in other 
LGBTQ+ spaces meant to be safe 
for all members of the community.

And as people of color who are 
also in the LGBTQ+ community, 
Black trans people are at the inter-
section of racism and homophobia 
in institutional systems. The Center 
for American Progress shows how 
only 35 percent of LGBTQ+ Black 
women have had mammograms in 
the past two years, compared to the 
57 percent of all LGBTQ+ women and 
the 62 percent of all heterosexual 
women. The distrust in the medi-
cal system creates a higher risk for 
people of color in the community, as 
30 percent of LGBTQ+ Black adults 
are likely to delay or not get needed 
medication compared to 19 percent 
of all Black heterosexual adults. 
These health disparities also apply 
to other communities of color, as 25 
percent of LGBTQ+ Asian or Pacific 
Island adults experience psychologi-
cal distress at a rate four times higher 
than heterosexual Asian and Pacific 
Islanders, and 2.5 times more than 
the general heterosexual population; 
and 60 percent of LGBTQ+ Latinx 
adults report more alcohol abuse in 
comparison to the 33 percent of the 
Latinx heterosexual population. 
As university students and as 
members of The Michigan Daily 
Editorial Board, we urge our fellow 
students to examine these systems 
of oppression and to analyze their 
own biases that may impact the lives 
of minorities one day. We stand in 
solidarity with all individuals cel-
ebrating Pride Month and we urge 
those individuals to continue to fight 
for the most oppressed, marginal-
ized and intersectional communities 
within each space. Understanding 
the complexities of each identity is 
essential to building a progressive, 
inclusive and worthwhile society for 
each individual. This conversation 
must continue beyond the month of 
June and after celebrations adorn-
ing rainbow flags and colorful outfits 
fade. Realizing the real trauma and 
pain, while also acknowledging the 
radiance and individuality of each 
community member, is critical to 
gaining a deeper understanding of 
the importance of intersectionality.

D

espite these historic events, 
the traction made hasn’t 
applied to all members of the 
community. In 2019 alone, “advocates 
tracked at least 27 deaths of transgen-
der or gender non-conforming people 
in the U.S. due to fatal violence, the 
majority of whom were Black transgen-
der women,” according to The Human 
Rights Campaign. 
As the Black Lives Matter protests 
continue, many activists are calling 
for justice for Riah Milton and Domi-
nique “Rem’mie” Fells, two Black 
trans women killed during the month 
of Pride. Furthermore, on June 12, 
the Trump administration finalized 
a rule to reverse nondiscrimination 
protections for trans individuals in the 
Affordable Care Act. The rule is set to 
go into effect this August. When over 
half of the U.S. public already believes 
that gender is determined at birth, this 
rule sets trans people up to face even 
more harm at the hands of the U.S. 
healthcare system. These inequities are 
often particularly worse for Black trans 
individuals, who experience the racial 
disparities of the U.S. healthcare sys-
tem exacerbated by COVID-19 in addi-
tion to transgender discrimination.
In order to understand the signifi-
cance of Pride month and the Black 
Lives Matter movement, one must 

comprehend the inherent definition of 
intersectionality — while there is varia-
tion in definitions, a key explanation 
is coined by American law professor 
Kimberlé Crenshaw. Crenshaw’s inter-
sectionality theory essentially allows 
users to see how categories of analy-
sis (race, class, gender) coalesce. She 
believes those who are at an intersec-
tion of identity, for example being both 
Black and a woman, tend to be failed 
by institutions of law or medicine and 
overlapping experiences of systemic 
oppression — for example, a combina-
tion of racism and sexism. Crenshaw 
heavily argued that the social institu-
tions and policies in the United States 
create and exacerbate women of color’s 
vulnerability to violence and abuse, 
and this situation is equally as appli-
cable to the LGBTQ+ community and 
Black people. The history of the fight 
for LGBTQ+ rights has been heav-
ily whitewashed and has unfortunately 
erased much of the efforts by people of 
color, especially trans Black women, 
who paved the way of American 
LGBTQ+ rights. 
While many credit the Stonewall 
riots as the spark of the LGBTQ+ rights 
movement, the first clear event that 
placed the transgender community on 
America’s political history originated 
in San Francisco’s Tenderloin neigh-

borhood, at Gene Compton’s cafeteria 
in 1966. In a community where many 
trans women and drag queens lived 
openly, with full self-expression, indi-
viduals would consistently face harass-
ment, abuse and arrest from local 
police officers. While the specific date 
of the riot is unknown, it is said that a 
trans woman, fed up with the constant 
aggravation and use of force by the 
police, threw a cup of coffee at an offi-
cer, igniting a riot.
Three years later, in New York City, 
police raided one of the few places peo-
ple of the same sex could dance togeth-
er without harassment, the Stonewall 
Inn. The Stonewall riots quickly erupt-
ed as patrons fought to defend them-
selves against police violence, throwing 
bricks and bottles, marking the tipping 
point for the LGBTQ+ liberation move-
ment. However, instead of crediting 
LGBTQ+ activists of color who were 
heavily involved and constantly fought 
against unjust police raids, such as 
Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera, 
people often focus on the mystery of 
who threw the first brick, or if Judy 
Garland, a white cisgender actress, was 
the inspiration for the riot. On the one 
year anniversary of the Stonewall riot, 
the first Pride march was held. These 
historical events that paved the way 
for future activism are often mistold,

Understanding intersectional Pride

T

hroughout the month of June, the 50th anniversary of Pride Month 
is being boldly and unapologetically celebrated by members of the 
LGBTQ+ community and its allies across the globe. As Pride has become 
a widespread protest and celebration internationally, the United States government 
has made some major strides in granting basic human rights to LGBTQ+ identifying 
people, like the legalization of same-sex marriage in 2015 and the recent Supreme 
Court ruling protecting the LGBTQ+ community from employer discrimination.

I

’ll be honest — signing a lease next 
to one of the largest fraternities on 
campus was a massive mistake, 
especially as someone unaffiliated with 
social Greek life. Over the past year, I’ve 
learned to fall asleep to the thumping of 
the bass on Theta Chi’s speakers on ran-
dom Tuesday nights and adjusted to rou-
tinely throwing their trash back into their 
backyard from mine, only to watch squir-
rels and other wildlife rummage through 
their abandoned beer, food, boxes and 
plastic containers. 
Admittedly, I should have considered 
who my neighbors would be before I 
moved into a house with the fraternity’s 
satellite houses in its backyard. I haven’t 
complained much throughout my time 
living here for that reason. However, 
observing their behavior amid a pandem-
ic has been revolting. In fact, this column 
was inspired by the large party that gath-
ered in their backyard on Thursday, June 
25, mirroring what fraternity parties 
looked like on campus before COVID-19. 
While on a slightly smaller scale, their 
backyard was flocked with people danc-
ing and, needless to say, not bothering to 
follow social distancing guidelines. 
Frankly, this isn’t at all surprising. 
There’s a constant plethora of controver-
sy surrounding both University-affiliated 
and unaffiliated fraternities on campus. 
Many of our fraternities have count-
less accusations of alcohol abuse, sexual 
assault, racism and hazing. In 2018, six 
fraternities, including Theta Chi, vol-
untarily disaffiliated from the Univer-
sity of Michigan due to changes in Ann 
Arbor zoning requirements that would 
force them to actually face repercussions 
for their irresponsible and loathsome 
actions. Still, I had some hope that these 
fraternity brothers, who are receiving a 
world-renowned education from a uni-
versity with one of the best public health 
programs in the world, would act some-
what responsibly and display at least a hint 
of their high-quality schooling during this 
pandemic. The party I involuntarily wit-
nessed from my bedroom window proves 
not only my own naivety but also Univer-
sity President Mark Schlissel’s.
Theta Chi’s latest disappointing dis-
plays of entitlement and foolishness 
are likely a result of Schissel’s recent 
announcement to have an in-residence 
fall semester. Although it’s clear to any 
knowledgeable being that these plans are 
only provisional — reliant on a continued 
flattening of the curve — these brothers 
still believe that the best way to respond 
to the University’s recently announced 
plans for the fall semester is to throw par-
ties. Schissel’s faith in students, especially 
those involved in social Greek life, to con-
tinue social distancing after returning to 
campus shows that his ignorance nearly 
matches that of the Theta Chi brothers. 

His false optimism, if left unchecked, 
will lead to even more parties like these 
throughout the upcoming semesters. 
Unfortunately, as stated above, Theta 
Chi has made their determination to 
avoid any consequences for their actions 
clear by disaffiliating with the University, 
making it all the more difficult to hold 
them accountable. For affiliated fraterni-
ties, the University and the Interfrater-
nity Council can — and should — ban all 
social engagements and Greek life activ-
ity in general for the upcoming semesters. 
Clearly, if left to their own devices, many 
of these students will prioritize their 
desire to binge drink and party exces-
sively over the health and safety of their 
peers as well as faculty, staff and residents 
of Ann Arbor. Their inability to care about 
anything outside of themselves will be on 
full display. 
However, for Theta Chi, other unaffili-
ated fraternities and those that will inevi-
tably disaffiliate when told that they have 
to forego their precious parties, this self-
ishness will lack consequence. In order to 
change that, the city of Ann Arbor holds 
the responsibility of enacting and enforc-
ing ordinances that will discourage large 
parties from occurring — not only for 
fraternities but also for co-ops and house 
parties thrown by the general student 
population. Currently, this would require 
police to increase patrolling the city for 
parties. Hopefully, the city can enlist a 
committee of sorts independent of the 
police to enforce this. Until the Univer-
sity defunds and divests from their police 
department, though, they’ll likely be on 
party patrol. 
Undoubtedly, if we are to have an in-
residence fall semester, the University 
should place as many bans as possible on 
both affiliated and unaffiliated fraterni-
ties in order to discourage parties. Out-
side of that, and in addition to action being 
taken by the city of Ann Arbor, the cam-
pus culture should normalize condemn-
ing large parties in the name of public 
safety. We must discourage our friends 
and classmates from attending and call 
out our fraternity neighbors for throwing 
them (I’m looking at you, Theta Chi). It’s 
imperative that we force Greek life to face 
their hypocrisy of throwing these parties 
despite their desire to return to campus 
this fall. They must be reminded that they 
aren’t the only students on campus or the 
only residents of this city. 
I’m well aware that I sound like the 
last person you’d want to invite to a party. 
Believe me, I don’t want the invite. I’ve 
enjoyed my fair share of fraternity parties 
and nights out in Ann Arbor.

W

hen I first learned 
Espresso Royale was 
closing all of its loca-
tions in early June, it felt like just 
another thing fighting for my atten-
tion. Amid the global COVID-19 
pandemic and Black Lives Matter 
protests following the killings of 
George Floyd and Breonna Tay-
lor — only two examples of white 
supremacy that have sparked recent 
uprisings — the news that the cof-
fee chain was closing seemed rath-
er insignificant. That’s not to say 
Espresso Royale’s closing, or the 
closing of any business predicted to 
not make it through the pandemic, 
won’t have a real impact for some of 
the 38.1 million Americans employed 
in the service and retail industries hit 
the hardest. Still, Espresso Royale’s 
closing did not seem like the great-
est cause for concern at the time. 
As I have had more time to reflect 
on the news, I am left with all of my 
memories sitting at Espresso Royale, 
an incredibly important place for me 
and many of my peers throughout 
college. It was where we would study 
on countless mornings, afternoons, 
evenings and late nights; met with 
friends in between classes; went on 
or observed awkward first dates and 
organized to work on group projects. 
Espresso Royale was a reliable study 
spot where you were bound to run 
into people you knew. 
While my peers and I ostensibly 
went to Espresso Royale to study, my 
favorite memories there were when 
we barely got any work done at all. 
You could always count on finding 
someone to talk to when you were 
avoiding homework. As a very extro-
verted person who loves to procras-
tinate, I would often go to Espresso 
Royale between classes, even when 
I had no work to do, just to take ref-
uge from the cold and find someone 
to chat with for a couple of minutes. 
While I stared at blank Word docu-
ments hoping my essay would type 
itself, I got to talk with friends or 
acquaintances about what was 
new in our lives, how we felt about 
school, where we were coming 
from and where we wanted to go. 
Since Espresso Royale was open 
until 11 p.m., we took shelter there 
for hours on end. 
During my junior year, I found 
myself bewildered by how much 
time my peers and I had spent 
at Espresso Royale’s State Street 
location, or ERSSL as we would 
commonly abbreviate it. It was 
impossible to walk into ERSSL with-
out seeing at least three people you 
knew. One night — while I was once 

again procrastinating completing my 
course readings — I took this bewil-
derment online. 
On Feb. 20, 2017, a fellow Michi-
gan Daily opinion editor and I start-
ed the Espresso Royale (State Street) 
Fan Club Facebook Group, an unof-
ficial fan page for people — mainly 
myself — to post Espresso Royale 
memes and commentary. The posts 
in our unofficial fan club ranged 
from a variety of topics: jokes about 
Espresso Royale’s renovations or the 
infamous “coffee12” wifi password, 
photos of people drinking Espresso 
Royale in their 8 a.m. class, questions 
about how much to tip for a $2.50 
latte and general posts about the 
Espresso Royale experience. There 
weren’t any rules dictating what 
was appropriate to post, as long 
as it was Espresso Royale-related. 
Despite the page never gaining 
more than 342 members, I reveled 
in the local fandom and small-town 
popularity the group provided 
me, loving the attention I got from 
strangers who grew to know me as 
“the Espresso Royale guy.” 
While it was all just for fun, our 
devotion to Espresso Royale left me 
with the same question that inspired 
me to start the page in the first place: 
Why the hell do we spend so much 
time at this coffee shop? My peers 
and I must have clocked hundreds 
of hours each at ERSSL. Given the 
wide array of coffee shops in Ann 
Arbor, I don’t think it’s controversial 
to say that Espresso Royale was not 
the greatest option in town. This is 
no fault of Espresso Royale. After all, 
how is one to compete with the likes 
of Literati Coffee or Roos Roast?
Still, even without these elite 
alternatives around to serve as points 
of comparison, it’s not as if Espresso 
Royale was trying very hard. The 
coffee, service and seating, albeit reli-
able, were all just okay. One day dur-
ing the summer after I graduated, I 
went into ERSSL with some friends 
to work on job applications only to 
find the A/C was out. This memory 
is representative of many ERSSL 
experiences: Showing up only to find 
something massively uncomfortable, 
yet staying for at least an hour any-
ways. While I would never go on the 
record saying ERSSL was perfect, 
the popular Zucchini bread, strong 
cups of coffee and camaraderie kept 
me coming back. 
With so many other great cafes 
to choose from, why did so many 
of my peers consistently congre-
gate at ERSSL? There are certainly 
some pragmatic reasons. Espresso 
Royale’s State Street location was rel-

atively accessible, convenient and 
open late. Espresso Royale’s prices 
were not radically different from 
other options nearby, such as Star-
bucks, but they generally let you use 
their space without buying anything. 
Their openness to letting people 
loiter in addition to the charm and 
$2 Latte Wednesday deal — a tradi-
tion celebrated like a holiday in the 
Espresso Royale Facebook group 
— made it a sufficient college study 
spot. You could find several friends 
in ERSSL on Wednesday mornings 
even when, to our collective horror, 
the latte deal was raised to $2.50 
Latte Wednesdays.
I am certainly not saying Espresso 
Royale’s storewide policy was to 
let anyone loiter. Although baristas 
tended not to care about people loi-
tering, or were just too busy to notice, 
I have still seen Espresso Royale staff 
ask homeless residents to leave. The 
best solution to the lack of places 
to go without spending money in a 
city as unaffordable as Ann Arbor 
— whether to study, see friends or 
simply take refuge from the rain 
— is increased investment in afford-
able housing and public community 
spaces, not private coffee shops. Still, 
even though Espresso Royale was 
not perfect, I worry that the next 
coffee shop to pop up will create 
just another unaffordable space in 
the city. The loss of Espresso Royale 
creates a vacuum for simple and low-
cost places for Ann Arbor residents to 
meet, work and caffeinate. 
While practical considerations 
drew me to Espresso Royale’s State 
Street location, the real appeal 
came from the space it provided 
to spend time with friends under 
the guise of getting work done. 
Espresso Royale made socializ-
ing easy. I would often go there to 
meet friends, many of whom I don’t 
catch up with anymore, without 
even telling them to show up. The 
closing of Espresso Royale, a cof-
fee shop that served a strong cup of 
coffee and an even stronger sense 
of community, is a massive loss to 
Ann Arbor.
I could always count on finding 
an extra chair to pull up across the 
coffee-stained carpet to a table of 
friends, a $2 Wednesday latte and 
vegan Zucchini bread in tow. But 
now, with Espresso Royale gone 
for good, those wobbly chairs are 
left empty and cheap coffees are a 
thing of the past.

The final $2.50 Wednesday latte

Elizabeth Lim’s second novel in the Blood 
of Stars series, “Unravel the Dusk,” reaches 
deep into your prefrontal cortex and implants 
a strong desire to embroider and to create. She 
makes sewing exciting, infusing time consum-
ing, mundane tasks with danger, dignity and 
purpose. 
In the world of “Unravel the Dusk,” embroi-
dery and tailoring is regarded and honored as 
capital-A Art. The highest title of Master Tailor 
is reserved only for accomplished men. Women, 
while able to practice the craft, are hampered by 
sexism. In the first book, “Spin the Dawn,” Maia 
rebels against the status quo. 
Taught by her aged father, once a Master 
Tailor, Maia struggles to keep her family shop 
open after her brothers are drafted into war. 
After the war ends, Maia has two dead brothers, 
a crippled brother and a fragile father. When 
her father is called upon by the emperor to craft 
clothing for the future empress. Maia worries 
that her father would not survive the arduous 
trip. To save what remains of her broken family, 
Maia passes herself off as her brother and goes 
to the capital in her father’s place. If her decep-
tion is discovered, Maia would be executed.
Aided by a divine pair of heirloom shears, 
Maia undergoes three trials to do the impos-
sible. Maia must retrieve divine materials to 
craft three legendary dresses: one from the 
laughter of the sun, one from the tears of the 
moon and one from the blood of the stars. 
Edan, the emperor’s enchanter, assists her as 
they travel to the far-flung corners of the land. 
Edan is revealed to be a jinn, a magician turned 
genie, bound to a thousand years of servitude. 
He serves as Maia’s love interest and as a prime 
example of Lim’s cross-cultural exchanges. 
While the Blood of Stars duology focuses on a 
single kingdom, the world Lim creates is vast. 
She allows Chinese folktale and Persian mythol-

ogy to interact and exist side by side. Jinn magic 
is not native to the Sino-inspired kingdom; thus, 
Edan is introduced as an enchanter. The cultur-
al diffusion recalls historical cultural diffusion 
that occurred because of trade routes like the 
Silk Road. The small details help anchor Lim’s 
fantasy world and lends it verisimilitude. 
In the second book of the series, Lim focuses 
more on developing a tight narrative and less on 
lateral world building. Court politics takes cen-
ter stage, with Maia attempting to uphold the 
tenuous peace and her own sanity. In the first 
book, the three divine dresses serve as Maia’s 
questing goal. They are mythic and unattain-
able yet vital to preserving peace. In the second 
book, Maia’s central conflict is within herself. 
She no longer needs to continue crafting with 
the threat of life or death. Maia already peaked 
in her tailoring career.
At the conclusion of the first book, the King-
dom plunges back into war with the rebel com-
mander, aided by demonic forces. Maia must 
rally her allies to combat the demonic threat. 
Thus, in “Unravel the Dawn,” Maia is less a 
seamstress and more a demon, an agent of war. 
While crafting takes up less space in the sec-
ond novel, “Unravel the Dawn” still reminds us 
that there is dignity in working with our hands, 
producing labors of love, beauty and sweat. Hav-
ing fewer crafting moments was disappointing 
but Maia’s character transition from creator to 
destroyer was exciting to read. 
Throughout the Blood of Stars duology, 
Elizabeth Lim unflaggingly stresses the magic 
of beautiful art and trade skills while bringing 
the suspense and drama. She depicts a robust 
world, fraught with political and social tension. 
For Maia, sewing is not compliance with the 
patriarchy. Rather, every stitch is a rebellion, 
a stand against the patriarchal status quo and 
looming demonic powers.

My mother’s copy of 
‘The Bluest Eye’

When my mother was in college, she would 
spend hours at the campus bookstore. She 
would browse the stacks of books assigned for 
literature classes that she was not taking. She 
would spend her money buying other people’s 
mandatory reading, and later would fall in love 
with the books she found. 
This was how she came across Toni Mor-
rison and “The Bluest Eye,” and how I came 
to find it in my bookshelf. I asked her why she 
never actually took these literature classes, 
especially when I realized that numerous 
books left to me were a result of her bookstore 
prowl, and her answer was simple. She didn’t 
like the analysis of the books, much like her 
disdain for the analysis of poetry. She couldn’t 
ever derive the deeper meaning of what she 
thought to be insignificant details, and she 
did not care to delve into the motifs of revered 
classics. It would strip her of the enjoyment of 
these books and discourage her reading habits. 
So when she read “The Bluest Eye,” she was 
only privy to her own interpretations. “It was 
a punch to the gut.” 
Set in Lorain, Ohio, in 1941, the book begins 
with narration by Claudia MacTeer, a woman 
describing events that happened around the 
time she was nine years old. That fall, her 
young friend Pecola was having her father’s 
baby. Claudia recollects how she and her sister 
Frieda planted marigolds in hopes that their 
success would signify the health of Pecola and 
her baby. But they did not bloom. No marigolds 
bloomed that fall in Lorain, and Pecola’s baby 
did not survive. “What is clear now is that of all 
of that hope, fear, lust, love and grief, nothing 
remains but Pecola and the unyielding earth.” 
The autumn the year prior, Claudia’s family 
had taken in Pecola temporarily after her father 
tried to burn down the family home. Pecola is 
a quiet and awkward little girl, obsessed with 
Shirley Temple and the belief that whiteness is 
beautiful, her own Blackness inherently ugly. 
Morrison uses Pecola to show “how something 
as grotesque as the demonization of an entire 
race could take root inside the most delicate 
member of society: a child; the most vulnerable 
member: a female.” 
Pecola moves back home to live with her 
unstable, alcoholic father, Cholly, distant 
mother Mrs. Breedlove and a runaway brother, 
Sammy. Pecola cannot escape. She begins to 
think it is the life she deserves because she is 
ugly, a belief reinforced by how she is treated in 
her community: She is invisible to the adults in 
the community, she is teased by boys at school 
and is framed for killing a boy’s cat. Pecola 
starts to believe she could transform her life if 
only she were prettier. She prays for blue eyes 

in an effort to change how the world views her, 
and she the world. 

One night, when Pecola is 11 years old, Chol-
ly returns home drunk. He sees her washing 
dishes and experiences several heavily con-
flicting emotions: tenderness, hatred and lust, 
all fueled by guilt. He rapes Pecola and leaves 
her unconscious on the floor. Her mother finds 
her, disbelieves her story and beats her. 
Pecola, now pregnant, visits a self-pro-
claimed psychic with her wish for blue eyes. 
He tricks her into killing a dog, and tells her its 
sudden death means her wish will be granted. 
After this, Claudia tells us how she and her 
sister learned through gossip that Pecola was 
pregnant. Pecola, who can no longer go to 
school, believes everyone’s disregard for her is 
rooted in their jealousy of her blue eyes.
“A punch in the gut” is an understatement. 
This novel stuns you — not only because it 
is blatantly apparent in its exposure of how 
the innate discrimination of society destroys 
young souls, but also purely by how it is writ-
ten. The form and structure is incredibly lyri-
cal and evocative. Morrison chose to break 
the story into distinct parts that, although 
divided by each season, are mostly narrated 
non-chronologically. It is the objective of the 
reader to reassemble the story. This choice was 
Morrison’s solution to centering the novel on 
Pecola, who is an incredibly delicate and vul-
nerable character. By giving the reader greater 
responsibility, Morrison hoped to provoke an 
“interrogation of themselves” rather than lead 
them into the comfort of pitying Pecola and 
ignoring the greater issues at hand. 
There are many frequent shifts between 
narrators and perspectives that emphasize 
Pecola’s shattered world. This ever-changing 
structure forbids the dehumanization of the 
characters who hurt Pecola, and shifts focus 
onto the systemic nature of the issues that 
occur. I found the structure to achieve its pur-
pose, and was surprised by Morrison’s claim 
in the forward that “it didn’t work: Many 
readers remain touched but not moved.” The 
quick shifts prevented me from becoming 
numb to the discomfort. Each distinct por-
tion of the novel induced a sense of uneasi-
ness, and forced me to acknowledge where 
this vexation was sprouting from: In each part, 
the same underlying beast was pulsating. I 
could trace my discomfort back to the root of 
the issue, the discriminatory system, that was 
responsible for the characters’ suffering. The 
shattered world was explicit. For a reader not 
to be moved means the reader was not paying 
attention.

BOOK REVIEW
BOOK REVIEW


Every time I see someone tread off 
a beaten trail, crushing plants in their 
wake, my heart crumples inside. “They’re 
just plants,” is the usual response I’m met 
with, words that cut inside me further. 
Plants may seem insignificant, partly due 
to their size and their position below our 
eye level. Humans are fascinated with 
animals larger than themselves — ele-
phants or killer whales, for example — but 
aren’t thrilled by a small shrub. 
But have we forgotten that plants give 
us life? Plants are the reason we can roam 
this Earth. Or, in the words of Robin Wall 
Kimmerer, plants give us “the privilege of 
breath.”
I wonder how often we think of plants 
and trees in this way, how regularly we 
view the world as animate and directly 
responsible for our own lives. How dif-
ferent would our world look if we saw 
the non-animal lives around us as our 
greatest teachers? In her book “Braid-
ing Sweetgrass,” Robin Wall Kimmerer 
shows us just how beautiful that planet 
could be. 
“Braiding Sweetgrass” focuses on the 
space between indigenous knowledge 
and scientific thought, where both thrive 
and complement each other. Kimmerer 
belongs to the Citizen Potawatomi nation, 
but is also a distinguished botanist. Lend-
ing her voice to both the scientific and 
indigenous perspective, Kimmerer recon-
ciles two worlds drifting apart, and uses 
her knowledge of both to envision a more 
sustainable future.
When I picked up “Braiding Sweet-
grass,” spring was knocking on my door. 

Lime-green shoots were beginning to 
peek out of the earth, the endless win-
ter finally ceasing. I remember walk-
ing through the forest and seeing right 
through it — the towering trees weren’t 
yet filled with leaves, but buds were start-
ing to sparkle in the dim sunlight. I read 
as the world was waking from its slumber, 
and Kimmerer’s words provided the per-
fect commentary. Kimmerer’s intricate 
understanding of the natural world isn’t 
intimidating, but rather comforting and 
gentle. You don’t have to be an ecologist 
to understand her writing and take some-
thing from it. Chapters are told as first 
person narratives, but by the end you’ve 
inadvertently learned enough about pond 
eutrophication or the utility of wetland 
cattails to confidently explain it to some-
one else.
Early on, Kimmerer challenges our pri-
vate, capitalist worldview, and instead 
urges us to think communally. The world 
isn’t rich for individual taking, but instead 
generous with resources that sustain lives 
and communities. As is the tragedy of the 
commons, our species often ends up tak-
ing more than our share, and as a result 
we see whole ecosystems — rainforests, 
wetlands, tundras — disappear. Kim-
merer gives a good reason for why we do 
this: The Western world still fails to rec-
ognize the world as animate. Indigenous 
languages such as Potawatomi are about 
70 percent verbs, while English is only 30 
percent. The verb “to be” applies to much 
more than just humans in Potawatomi, 
and thus many more things are consid-
ered alive.

This week marked four months since San 
Francisco Ballet first cancelled a performance 
due to coronavirus. In early March, the compa-
ny was one of the first in the country to feel the 
effects of stay-at-home orders and their much-
hyped run of “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” 
came to a screeching halt. Soon after, SFB 
cancelled four more productions, locked their 
rehearsal spaces and spearheaded a series of 
online programming that, like most other com-
panies, established Instagram as a quasi-home 
base. Over the last four months, SFB’s feed 
shifted from a uniform presentation of profes-
sionally staged photography to a rather endear-
ing hodgepodge of at-home studios, amateur 
lighting and IGTV streams of digital seasons. 
This collage of imagery was no different two 
weeks ago on June 19 when the company took 
part in the #JuneteenthDanceBreak initiative 
started by Theresa Ruth Howard, founder of 
the organization Memoirs of Blacks in Ballet. A 
week and a half prior, Howard had challenged 
the global dance community to join her in “lift-
ing up the legacies, contributions, accomplish-
ments, and stories” of Black artists. The task 
was simple: On June 19, “dedicate your feed to 
the display of the beautiful diversity of Black-
ness” with at least four separate posts through-
out the day. 
Howard’s proposition was one of the many 
initiatives born of a burgeoning awareness for 
the Juneteenth holiday. The date commemo-
rates the day that the last enslaved people finally 
received news of their freedom on June 19, 1865. 
The event took place two and a half years after 
the Emancipation Proclamation and its history, 
like many other facets of Black history, remains 
largely absent from our public awareness. This 
year, ongoing protests against racial injustice 
have emboldened arguments for America to 
recognize the date both as a federal holiday as 
well as a chance to reflect more generally on the 
systemic issues of racism that still exist today.
Juneteenth thus has multiple angles: It cel-
ebrates the freedom of Black Americans while 
also offering somber perspectives on the prog-
ress that we have yet to achieve. Howard dis-
tilled these two meanings in her creation of the 
Juneteenth Dance Break — she wanted to make 
space for Black people’s “beauty, creativity, 
ingenuity, elegance, power, and perseverance.” 
To celebrate, but also to learn. 
SFB was one of many organizations that 
partook in Howard’s project. Their June 19 
feed started with an Instagram Live stream of 
dancer Kimberly Marie Olivier and her father-
in-law, principal bassoon player Rufus Olivier. 
The two Black artists took an hour to talk about 
ballet, bassoons and Black history. The rest of 
the company’s posts were a mixture of shorter 

videos and still photos. All in all, SFB shared 
over an hour and a half of content and multiple 
paragraphs of information about Black danc-
ers, choreographers and musicians who form 
part of SFB’s past and present. The result was 
an impressive use of the dance world’s quaran-
tined predicament — an insightful yet fully dig-
ital combination of education and celebration 
with the timely and timeless lens of redefining 
racial perceptions of ballet. 
The outpouring from other organizations 
was also impressive: The celebration cut divides 
of hierarchical status and spanned the distance 
between institutions like American Ballet The-
atre all the way to smalltown dance studios. 
When the sun rose on June 20, the world sud-
denly had access to a wide-reaching archive 
of information about Black dancers of past 
and present and their profound effect on our 
stages today. In an added bonus, the resources 
were (and still are) easily accessible in one place 
under the #JuneteenthDanceBreak hashtag on 
Instagram.
Howard quickly took to her own account to 
thank everyone for their “enthusiastic and cre-
ative participation.” Indeed, the celebration had 
uncovered something rather unprecedented: 
Dance history, let alone Black dance history, is 
a dwindling field. The Juneteenth Dance Break 
gave a voice to marginalized stories within an 
oft-forgotten domain. “This is history,” Howard 
said, “this is world history. This is dance histo-
ry. This is not just Black history, it’s history. It’s 
American history, and it’s all of ours. It belongs 
to all of us.” 
But Howard was also clear: “It’s just a start. 
And I hope that this is the beginning.” 
June of 2020 operated almost as a highlight 
reel of dance companies dedicating and re-
dedicating themselves to racial justice in the 
performing arts industry. The process started 
with messages of #TheShowMustBePaused 
on Blackout Tuesday, moving to initiatives 
like #BalletRelevesForBlackLives or #NoJus-
ticeNoDance and most recently the #June-
teenthDanceBreak. These are, of course, only 
hashtags — they do not replace updated poli-
cies and real change, but they do seem to have 
provided a start for some. The even murkier 
side of this movement, however, lies in what 
hasn’t even made it to Instagram at all: the 
companies that waited until their only Black 
dancer complained of racist policies to release a 
solidarity statement, the companies that didn’t 
acknowledge Juneteenth or the ones that only 
posted one haphazard photograph to jump on 
the bandwagon. Actions speak louder than 
words, even though words are much better 
than silence.

The overglorified Disney+ 
Hamilfilm

On July 3, Disney+ will be exclusively 
streaming Lin-Manuel Miranda’s hit musi-
cal, “Hamilton,” also known as #Hamilfilm. 
Ever since 2015, “Hamilton” has been highly 
praised because it features solely BIPOC 
singers and actors on the Broadway stage 
telling the tale of the American Revolution. I 
myself am a huge fan of musicals and Broad-
way history, so when “Hamilton” came out, 
I couldn’t help but sing along to the Schuyler 
sisters and wished one day I would be able to 
accrue enough money to squeeze myself into 
the Richard Rodgers Theatre. 
Recently I noticed a lot of criticism toward 
the musical, and recognized how ironic and 
inappropriate the whole concept was: people 
of color, whose very existence was threat-
ened by the people they were portraying, in 
a business which also has a history of exclud-
ing those who weren’t rich and white. Many 
before me have recognized the several issues 
“Hamilton” fans often glaze over. Writer 
Gene Demby noticed when he attended the 
show how there were only a handful of POC 
between him and the actors, and notes how 
“Hamilton” particularly attracts white audi-
ences. Theatre has a history of segregated 
seating, plays with racist caricatures and 
minstrel shows. Along with the historical 
white audience, the exorbitant high ticket 
prices and constant sold-out status of the 
shows prevent the working class and BIPOC 
from attending as well. 
Even with a primarily white audience and 
a musical being held in a historically rac-
ist production setting, my biggest critique 
of “Hamilton” is its historical inaccuracies. 
While I understand the musical is purely 
entertainment, and it could be bold for me to 
assume that people would believe in the por-
trayal of past white historical figures, when 
it comes to conversations of racism, slavery 
and how BIPOC were treated in colonial 
America, it wouldn’t surprise me if people 

The American Dream: A 
personofcolor’simpossible 
pursuit

JENNY CHONG
MiC Staff Writer

In the second grade, my teacher asked 
the class to explain why people immigrated 
to the United States. My hand shot up with 
enthusiasm — I wanted to share my fam-
ily’s story. “My parents came here because 
they wanted freedom and a better life,” I 
answered patriotically. 
At the time, I believed America was the 
land where hopes and dreams would come 
true for everyone — where “all men are cre-
ated equal” as the Declaration of Indepen-
dence claims. My parents left their small 
village in Guangdong, China, and immigrat-
ed to New York with the same determined 
mindset. They wanted to prove anything was 
possible in America, and attest to the validity 
of the rags to riches fantasy. To their dismay, 
achieving the American Dream was harder 
than they’d expected as non-English speak-
ers without a college education. Sacrificing 
this dream for their blue-collar jobs, they 
passed these aspirations down to my siblings 
and me, pushing us to pursue higher educa-
tion so we would obtain high paying jobs. 
In becoming successful, they believed we 
would also live a happy and comfortable life. 
I find skepticism in that sentiment, however. 
As long as I am a person of color in America, 
I will never live comfortably because racism 
will remain an ailment hanging over me. As 
long as the color of my skin is the main deter-
minant of how society treats me, I will never 
be able to fulfill the American Dream. 
Coined by James Truslow Adams in his 
book “The Epic of America,” the American 
Dream is a dream in which an individual can 
be recognized “for what they are, regardless 
of the (unanticipated) circumstances of birth 
or position.” This has encouraged lower class 
Americans and immigrants to work harder 
and seek higher education in order to live a 

prosperous life, but it fails to acknowledge 
how one’s race plays a role in economic suc-
cess or societal acceptance. 
The United States has a history of systemi-
cally oppressing communities of color and 
immigrants in an effort to protect its white 
Americans from foreign influences. The 
Immigration Act of 1924 barred all Asians 
from entering the country and set quotas 
for countries outside of the Western Hemi-
sphere. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, over 
127,000 Japanese-Americans were forced to 
relocate to internment camps because Amer-
icans feared they were spies for the Japa-
nese government. More recently, the Trump 
administration ordered three variations of 
Muslim bans, the latest of which blocks peo-
ple from seven countries, five being predomi-
nately Muslim, from traveling to the U.S. The 
ban also denies Temporary Protected Status 
(TPS) for Somalia, Sudan, Yemen and Syria 
— leaving refugees vulnerable to deportation 
back to countries in the midst of war, natural 
disasters and humanitarian crises. Restrict-
ing rights for communities of color is no dif-
ferent than upholding white supremacy. 
Black Americans have borne the brunt of 
centuries of systemic oppression. Despite 
the abolishment of slavery and segregation 
laws, American policies manage to covertly 
discriminate against the Black community 
across many facets of life, ultimately main-
taining many characteristics of the slave 
institution. The American Dream fails to 
recognize that not everyone is given an equal 
opportunity to succeed, and it would be naive 
to believe otherwise — however the glorifi-
cation of the dream itself nurtures the idea 
that everyone who comes from some sort of 
struggle has an equitable chance at acquiring 
said dream, but this is far from true.

become misinformed. Historian Lyra Mon-
teiro notes how Miranda conducts a strat-
egy called “Founders Chic,” representing 
the founders of America as relatable or cool 
people. This strategy distracts from the fact 
that the Founding Fathers were enslavers. 
In regards to Hamilton specifically, who is 
decorated as a great anti-slavery abolition-
ist, it is not mentioned that he once worked 
on a slave ship. There were actually few 
white people who were opposed to slavery, 
especially in the Carribean, and there is no 
historical accounts or statement to back up 
that Hamilton was anti-slavery. One of the 
reasons why Hamilton didn’t own slaves 
was because he was a poor immigrant, thus 
it was rather a practical addition rather than 
a moral protest. 
Furthermore, the beautiful, intelligent 
and independent portrayal of the Schuyler 
family and sisters, while entertaining, dis-
tracts from their grand involvement in the 
business of enslaving. Elizabeth Schyuler 
was able to sing tunes such as “Helpless” 
at the ball and attract Hamilton because 
she had several enslaved people to prepare 
her. And on the note of the Schuyler sisters, 
“Hamilton” is also criticized for not passing 
the Bechdel test — while it seemingly fea-
tures strong women, all the dialogue and plot 
revolve around the men.
Another core feature of the musical, which 
is also extremely problematic, is Miranda’s 
usage of the bootstraps immigration narra-
tive. Hamilton is depicted as a rags to riches 
story. While it can’t be denied Hamilton may 
have worked hard for his success, it heavily 
denotes his other success factors and gas-
lights the struggles of other immigrants who 
may have worked just as hard but had soci-
etal oppressors keeping them from the same 
level of success. Factors such as structural 
racism, predatory capitalism and policies 
which prevented citizenship which...

As I showed my mom my out-
fit for school in the morning, she 
performed her routine check. She 
nodded as she scanned me up and 
down until she noticed a new piece 
of apparel. 
After months of pleading and 
convincing, I was finally wearing 
a pair of ripped jeans. I held my 
breath in anticipation for her order 
to change my outfit, but she reluc-
tantly mumbled, “Looks good.” 
I heard traces of disbelief in her 
voice. Why anybody would want to 
pay full price for “destroyed” cloth-
ing was beyond her, but I think in 
that moment she finally grasped 
how much it meant to me. In Leba-
non, her home country, clothing 
like ripped jeans was always reject-
ed and out of the question. My 
mom’s acceptance, though reluc-
tant, was a sign of accepting a piece 
of American culture and realizing 
how I was raised in the United 
States, not the Middle East. 
I’ve always had an underlying 
frustration with who I am, but I 
came to terms with my identity 
struggle when I began high school. 
Having come from a middle school 
surrounded by other Middle East-
ern students, I never stood out in 
the classroom. Because of this, 
I experienced a culture shock 
when I entered my dominantly 
white high school. I felt as though 
everybody around me was raised 
on a completely different planet 
with different cultural values. For 
instance, dating in Middle Eastern 
culture is highly frowned upon, 
especially as teenagers. I spent my 
entire life being told I was never 

allowed to engage in a romantic 
relationship. I was shocked when I 
began high school and my peers all 
around me were dating, even kiss-
ing in the hallways. I have never 
been allowed to wear leggings or 
cropped shirts, yet it seemed to 
be the preferred style among my 
female classmates. Even though I 
lived and grew up in Metro Detroit 
just like the other students, I had 
never felt more alienated. I felt 
like a foreigner in my home coun-
try. Eventually, I tried to voice my 
concerns to my parents. I found 
this difficult because their high 
school experiences were drasti-
cally different from the “typical” 
American’s. My mom was raised 
in Lebanon and my dad was raised 
in Iraq, where the purpose of sec-
ondary education was simply to do 
homework and graduate. Events 
like spirit week, Friday night foot-
ball games and homecoming were 
nonexistent. Though my parents 
never held me back and encour-
aged me to be active in my school 
community, they never actually 
experienced any of these activities 
themselves. 
When I first tried to have a talk 
with my parents about my struggle 
to fit in, they had no 
idea how to react. My mom and 
dad had raised my older siblings 
with traditional Middle Eastern 
values, and no questions were 
asked. I was the first of their chil-
dren to spark conversation about 
our values. I became frustrated 
when my parents accused me of 
attempting to abandon my culture. 
“Why are you going against the 
ways we raised you? Why aren’t our 
ways good enough for you?” Time 
after time, I exasperatedly retali-
ated with “That’s not how it works 

in this country!” 
I have never been ashamed of 
being Arab-American, but as I 
spent my entire school career being 
asked about my “radical” culture 
and accused of being a terrorist, I 
could not help but think about how 
much easier it would be to be like 
everybody else. I did not choose 
my ethnic background. My par-
ents made the choice to immigrate 
to the United States, and I have to 
deal with the consequences. For 
instance, I was once approached 
by an elderly woman while I was 
browsing through a department 
store. She gave me a silent, dis-
gusted stare before yelling, “You 
filthy Arab! How dare you come to 
my country! You make me sick!” I 
often reflect on this incident and 
constantly wonder if it would have 
occurred had I looked differently. 
The most heartbreaking part of 
this experience was looking at my 
mom and seeing the utter devasta-

tion in her expression. The guilt she 
felt was palpable. She never wanted 
her children to experience the dis-
crimination and isolation that she 
received when she first arrived in 
the United States. 
Little by little, I attempted to 
prove to my parents how adapt-
ing to American culture was not a 
rejection of my ethnic background, 
but rather a means of creating an 
identity for myself as an Arab-
American. My mom and dad slowly 
allowed this change, and each new 
opportunity was a personal vic-
tory. As a 15-year-old sophomore, 
I finally attended my first high-
school party. Of course, I had to 
dress conservatively, text my mom 
every five minutes and be home by 
nine. I accepted these unsurpris-
ing terms and celebrated this step 
in the right direction. That night, 
I came to a realization: I hated 
parties. This was extremely dis-
appointing to me, but an absolute 

relief for my parents. 
Near the beginning of my junior 
year, I attended my first dance with 
a date. Just two years before, my 
parents and I discussed that boys 
were, simply put, “bad news.” Yet, 
here I was, walking into a school 
dance with a boy. I smiled as I 
reflected on this personal victory, 
and though my parents were miles 
away, I could hear their worried 
thoughts as if they were standing 
right next to me. 
My parents have always empha-
sized the importance of maintain-
ing my Lebanese-Iraqi roots. I was 
brought up speaking Arabic and 
practicing traditional Middle East-
ern values, which was something 
that my high school peers were not 
familiar with. I grew up listening 
to Arabic music and watching Ara-
bic television programs.

Director of counseling Harden retires after 34 years

After 34 years at Michigan, 
Greg 
Harden, 
who 
served 
as 
both 
executive 
associate 
athletic director and director of 
counseling has retired, Angelique 
Chengelis from the Detroit News 
reported Monday. Harden joined 
Michigan after being hired by Bo 
Schembechler 1986 and grew the 
prevalence of the mental well-
being 
of 
athletes 
throughout 
his years at the University and 
established 
the 
importance 
of 
mental 
health 
to 
athletic 
achievement.
“So from the moment that our 
student athletes step on campus 
every year they participate in a 
multitude of different trainings,” 
assistant 
director 
of 
athletic 
counseling Abigail Eiler said in an 
interview with The Daily in April. 
“One is the high impact training, 
another is a welcome home event 
where a counseling team does a lot 
of psycho-education about taking 
care of themselves and utilizing 

that wholistic perspective — it’s 
not just your physical health, it’s 
your mental health, emotional 
health and beyond.”
Throughout his time in Ann 
Arbor, Harden has worked with 
athletes like Tom Brady, Desmond 
Howard, Jalen Rose and Michael 
Phelps to help them through rough 
periods of their lives, but has also 
worked with less high-profile 
athletes. His department doesn’t 
just show up to football practices, 
but they have counselors attend 
track meets, hockey games and 
other smaller sporting events.
“We will be working with teams 
on high performance,” Eiler said, 
“all the way up to working with 
students individually that are 
experiencing severe and persistent 
mental illness and so because 
there’s that spectrum there are so 
many different entry points.”
Desmond Howard said in a 2014 
60 Minutes interview without 
Harden, he wouldn’t have won the 
Heisman Trophy during the 1991 
season. Tom Brady, in an interview 
with the Detroit News, said 
Harden set him on a path to “Stop 

complaining and start doing.” His 
story is one that can be told by the 
hundreds of athletes he meets with 
a year, who claim he is the “unsung 
hero” of Michigan athletics.
Harden’s 
philosophy 
he 
bestowed on the athletes was 

to “control the controllables.” A 
simple mantra, it transcends sport 
into life, powerfully resonating 
with athletes who are struggling 
with something outside a field, 
court or rink.
While 
Harden 
is 
officially 

retiring this summer, it isn’t the 
first time he’s thought about it — 
Harden considered retirement in 
2016, but with the hiring of new 
Athletic Director Warde Manuel, 
he stayed on for a couple more years 
to smooth out the transition. Now, 
he leaves behind a department that 
is larger and more vital to success 
than ever before.

Michigan releases athletic budget, projects $26.1 million deficit

The University of Michigan 
Athletic 
Department 
released 
its budget projections Monday, 
predicting a deficit for the next 
fiscal year. 
For the current fiscal year, 
the department expects a one 
million dollar surplus as a result 
of reduced team activities and 
operations expenses following 
the COVID-19 pandemic. The 
official 
department 
revenue 
comes out to $187.4 million while 
accruing $186.4 million in costs. 
During 
the 
2020-21 
fiscal 
year, beginning on July 1, the 
athletic department expects its 
revenue to drop to just $135.8 
million 
while 
its 
expenses 
decrease to $161.9 million, which 
would lead to a deficit of $26.1 
million. The revenue decrease 
is based mainly on a 50 percent 
decrease in spectator admissions 
revenue, while the expenses are 
dropping due to a mixture of 
decreased expenditures in all 

areas, including team and game 
expenditures, and a salary cut 
for senior level employees — 
including 10 percent reductions 
from athletic director Warde 
Manuel, 
football 
coach 
Jim 
Harbaugh and men’s basketball 

coach Juwan Howard. 
“Full-time 
staff 
members 
earning 
between 
$50,000-
$100,000 
will 
have 
salaries 
reduced 
by 
5 
percent, 
and 
employees 
earning 
between 
$100,001-$150,000 
will 
have 

wages reduced by 7.5 percent 
during the same period,” the 
University said in a statement. 
“Staff earning less than $50,000 
will not see any reduction in pay.”
One 
expense 
that 
is 
not 
projected to have cuts is student-

athlete financial aid:
“That category will see an 
increase of $0.8 million,” the 
release 
said. 
“Primarily 
due 
an increase in the number of 
student-athletes 
remaining 
on scholarship following the 
cancellation of the 2020 spring 
athletic season and anticipated 
increases in tuition.”
Perhaps the most lofty goal is 
a decrease in admissions revenue 
by just 50 percent, in a time when 
the United States is experiencing 
a second wave of COVID-19. 
Most of that revenue comes from 
football game days, and until 
Michigan and the Big Ten create 
a policy on how many spectators 
are allowed within stadiums, that 
number will remain an optimistic 
projection.
Michigan, with one of the 
largest 
athletic 
departments, 
is better-suited to withstand 
the detriments of the current 
crisis than smaller programs. 
Still, the downriver effects may 
be significant, especially with 
the 
uncertainty 
surrounding 
whether there will be fans in the 
stadium — or sports at all.

‘The perfect storm’: Mbogo Mwangi speaks on race in America 
today, and how the lacrosse community needs to do better

Growing up on Manhattan’s 
Upper East Side, Mbogo Mwangi 
never dealt with race as an issue. 
St. Stephen of Hungary, the 
private Catholic school that the 
junior defenseman attended, was 
a microcosm of New York City’s 
melting pot. Because Mwangi 
and his classmates all came from 
different ethnic backgrounds, 
race became a moot point. No 
one was ever treated differently 
because of how they looked or 
dressed.
But in 2011, his family left 
the city for Radnor, Penn., a 
predominantly white, affluent 
suburban 
community 
on 
Philadelphia’s Main Line. That 
was where Mwangi first learned 
that he would not go through 
life without being judged by the 
color of his skin.
Transferring 
to 
Radnor 
Middle School, a school that 
was 99 percent white, Mwangi 
struggled with cases of subtle 
racism daily. People touched 
his hair. Curious eyes glanced 
over at him during his history 
teacher’s measly day-and-a-half 
lecture on racism and slavery. 
He was excluded from social 
events because his classmates 

feared their parents would be 
mad that he looked or dressed 
“differently.” 
“As a black kid growing up in 
this environment, you are slowly, 
calmly and subtly reminded that 
you are different because of the 
color of your skin, and you will 
be treated differently because 
of that,” Mwangi told The Daily. 
“It’s difficult, because when you 
don’t have anyone that looks like 
you around you, there’s nobody to 
really talk to. You don’t go home 
and talk about the issues you 
have with your parents because 
(the issues) are so small. … They 
are just kind of this undertone 
that walks around with you with 
every single interaction that you 
have.”
Sometimes, it wasn’t so subtle.
He remembers playing a game 
with a ball on a trampoline in 
eighth grade with three of his 
closest friends at the time. When 
the ball fell out and onto the 
ground, one of Mwangi’s friends 
suggested that he go get the ball. 
When he refused, the friend 
called him “his slave” and the 
n-word. 
It was the first time anyone 
had called Mwangi that word.
“In that moment, it was as 
if I was in a Matrix-type space 
where it was just all white 
around me and I was just kind of 

shook to the core,” Mwangi said. 
“It was one of those moments 
that I’ll never forget. … It seems 
like time kind of stops. You go 
within yourself and just start to 
question everything. It doesn’t 
seem real. And until you have 
had an experience like that, 
I can’t really explain what it 
means.”
The Main Line is one of 
the hottest lacrosse breeding 
grounds in the country, and 
all of Mwangi’s friends at the 
time were playing the game. He 
thought it seemed like fun, so he 
decided to give it a shot.
But 
even 
Mwangi’s 
first 
encounter with lacrosse was 
touched by racism. Playing a 
sport where only 4.4 percent 
of its NCAA Division I student 
athletes were black in 2019, he 
was judged by the color of his 
skin from the instant he stepped 
on the field.
Mwangi had never even picked 
up a stick before, so he naturally 
struggled at his first tryout for 
Radnor Youth Lacrosse. Unable 
to pick up ground balls with his 
stick, he crouched down every 
time the ball came towards him 
and picked it up with his hand.
“I 
was 
the 
worst 
out 
there 
obviously,” 
Mwangi 
remembered. 
“It 
was 
very 
evident that I was definitely out 

of my element.”
The next day, one of Mwangi’s 
classmates came up to him and 
asked him why he went to the 
tryouts. Instead of offering words 
of encouragement, his classmate 
suggested that Mwangi should go 
play basketball instead because 
“he’d probably be better at that.”
“As a Black person in America, 
you kind of learn what people 
mean when they say certain 
stuff,” Mwangi said. “That was 
one of those things when (I 
realized) that I’m not going to 
be able to play this sport without 
my race being a part of it.”
Mwangi stuck with lacrosse, 
and as he grew older, his skills 
developed rapidly.
Still, 
he 
was 
treated 
differently on the lacrosse field 
due to the color of his skin. 
Opponents yelled racial slurs 
at him on the field. He was cut 
from his summer club lacrosse 
team twice, suspiciously in favor 
of players Mwangi deemed less 
talented, before finally making 
it on his third try. When he 
decided to attend the Haverford 
School, an all-boys prep school 
and lacrosse powerhouse near 
Radnor, many people told him 
that he wasn’t good enough to 
go there and that he would never 
play.
But 
Mwangi 
used 
Black 
professional lacrosse players like 
Kyle Harrison, the first Black 
man to win NCAA lacrosse’s 
Tewaaraton 
Award, 
as 
his 
inspiration 
to 
keep 
pushing 
forward. Any comments that 
doubted his ability or stake in 
the game were absorbed and 
used as motivation. Harrison’s 
legacy showed Mwangi what was 
attainable for Black men who 
play lacrosse.
When 
Mwangi 
arrived 
at 
Haverford, he met his best 
friend, Isaiah, who is half-Black. 
For the first time since leaving 
Manhattan, he finally felt like 
he had someone to talk about the 
racial injustices he was dealing 
with. 
For the first time since moving, 
he found someone like him.
“Having my best friend also 
be Black helped with (all that) 
because (I was) with someone 
who (looked) like me,” Mwangi 
said. “We dealt with the issue of 
subconsciously being reminded 

that you’re not gonna be like 
everyone else (together).”
And on the lacrosse field, 
Mwangi saw the merits of his 
hard work pay off. The Fords 
won three consecutive Inter-
Academic League championships 
during his four years on the 
team. In 2018, Michigan coach 
Kevin Conry offered Mwangi a 
spot on the Wolverines’ men’s 
lacrosse team, making him the 
only player from his middle 
school class that would go on to 
play Division I lacrosse.

Two 
weeks 
ago, 
Mwangi 
led a Zoom video call with his 
coaches and teammates. The 
topic of conversation surrounded 
the issue of race in America, 
a response to the murder of 
George Floyd and ongoing Black 
Lives Matter protests.
Having felt the burden of 
racism on his shoulders his 
entire life, he finally felt like he 
had an opportunity to speak on 
the issue.
“I never really thought that 
I’d have a platform to speak 
on this,” Mwangi said. “Prior 
to everything going on, if you 
would’ve asked me if I would be 
the one to stand up and speak to 
a group of people that I trusted 
and are my friends about the idea 
of race, I would’ve told you that 
you were lying.”
Over Zoom, Mwangi shared 
his experiences as a Black man. 
After explaining how he gets 
pulled over by the police in his 
friends’ 
neighborhoods 
back 
home; after revealing that he 
has had job applications ignored 
because 
of 
his 
name; 
after 
pouring his heart out about how 
this is an issue of human rights, 
not politics, Mwangi hoped his 
coaches and teammates would 
begin to take the time to listen, 
to educate themselves and to 
pursue a more active role in the 
fight for racial justice.
Mwangi spoke of the idea of 
a “perfect storm,” in which the 
culmination of three “waves” 
have allowed the previously 
apathetic white population to 
become cognizant of the ongoing 
racial injustice that has festered 
in the United States for 400-plus 
years.

Mwangi’s 
first 
wave 
was 
the product of COVID-19 and 
the disproportionate mortality 
rate between Black and white 
Americans 
exacerbated 
by 
disparities in healthcare access 
and employment opportunities. 
The second and third waves 
were 
based 
on 
the 
police’s 
double standard in managing 
its altercations with Black and 
white individuals: The absence of 
aggression towards armed, white 
protestors who stormed state 
capital buildings in opposition 
to stay-at-home orders versus 
the brute force used in Floyd’s 
murder and recent BLM protests.
“(The white population has) 
embraced it as part of their 
fight,” Mwangi said. “For so long, 
it’s been our fight to burden, but 
this perfect storm illustrates that 
after what has happened, you 
cannot dispute that the systems 
that enable racism are alive and 
well. Their involvement is what 
is allowing for this change to 
happen, and for it to happen so 
loudly.”
Despite 
his 
positivity 
regarding 
the 
status 
of 
white activism, Mwangi was 
dissatisfied with his teammates’ 
response 
to 
recent 
racially-
focused events prior to the Zoom 
call. Many of them reached out 

to him personally but had not 
been vocal on social media.
“They’ve 
expressed 
their 
views to me, and that’s been 
good,” Mwangi said. “But at the 
end of the day, I’m not the one 
who needs to hear that they’re 
with me. I need them to let 
their white friends and family 
members know that they stand 
with me. … For me, to have 
someone text me and ask if I’m 
okay, that’s nice, but it doesn’t 
solve the problem.”
According to Mwangi, his 
white teammates have a larger 
platform because of the color 
of their skin, so they need to 
use their privilege to take on 
a more significant role in the 
movement.
“White people have a voice, 
and they are heard, unlike Black 
people,” Mwangi said. “Being 
silent is being compliant. By 
not saying anything, you are 
saying something, and it’s loud. 
It speaks volumes. … Their 
involvement is crucial to any 
change happening.”

The topic and issue of racial 
equality in lacrosse extends far 
beyond the scope of Michigan’s 
team.
Concerns about diversity in 
the sport and socioeconomic 
barriers to playing have long 
been ignored. Despite the game’s 
origins 
in 
Native 
American 
culture, it has been captured by 

the stereotype of the ‘lax bro:’ a 
white preppy kid with long hair 
who comes from an affluent 
background.
“The history of (lacrosse) 
has been stripped away and the 
game has become this separate 
entity,” 
Mwangi 
believes. 
“There needs to be an active 
effort to increase the diversity 
of the game, grow the game 
more and educate ourselves on 
the history of the game. Because 
it didn’t start at white prep 
schools; it’s much deeper than 
that. To many groups of people, 
it’s a way of life. … So we need to 
respect that wholeheartedly in 
order to play the game the way it 
was intended to be played.”
Lacrosse is one of the fastest 
growing sports in the United 
States. 
In 
2018, 
nearly 
1.1 
million boys and girls played 
in a youth lacrosse league. In 
the state of Michigan, lacrosse 
saw the greatest increase in 
participation rate of any high 
school sport in 2019.
Yet the game’s growth has not 
been equitable. 
Many 
communities, 
particularly in cities, have been 
unable to adopt the sport because 
of its incredibly high associated 
costs. In Philadelphia, only ten 
out of 42 city public high schools 
had a varsity lacrosse program 
in 2019. In Washington D.C., 
only two schools had programs.
While 
many 
high 
school 

football programs are funded 
by the schools themselves, and 
playing basketball only requires 
a pair of shoes and a ball, 
purchasing lacrosse equipment 
can cost hundreds of dollars per 
person. Since very few schools 
provide 
lacrosse 
equipment 
for their student athletes, it is 
often up to the individual to buy 
their own gear — an enormous 
financial burden to middle and 
low-income households.
Aware of his own privileges 
to be able to afford his lacrosse 
equipment, 
Mwangi 
also 
acknowledged the high cost of 
playing for a summer club team. 
The club teams provide access 
to summer tournaments and 
showcases, where the majority 
of college recruiting is done. The 
inability to afford membership 
dues for one of these club teams 
could make or break a player’s 
chances 
of 
playing 
at 
the 
collegiate level.
In spite of these hurdles, 
several 
groups 
across 
the 
country are working to boost 
racial 
and 
socioeconomic 
diversity in lacrosse.
Liam McIlroy is the head 
coach of the boy’s lacrosse team 
at Cass Tech, the only Detroit 
public high school currently 
offering lacrosse as a varsity 
sport. Last May, after watching 
his student athletes fall in love 
with the game during their 
debut season, McIlroy joined 
forces with Christianne Malone, 

a longtime advocate for lacrosse 
in Detroit, to co-found Detroit 
United 
Lacrosse 
— 
a 
club 
dedicated to growing lacrosse 
in the city by giving male 
and female student athletes a 
platform to develop their skills 
outside of the regular season 
through summer tournaments 
and recruiting showcases.
“We’re building community, 
not 
only 
with 
playing 
experience, but also the fact 
that when we go to different 
tournaments, 
showcases 
and 
scrimmages we are the only team 
that is a majority team of color,” 
McIlroy said. “We represent 
a very diverse cultural team. 
(And) we are going to continue 
to work with the players that 
we have and help them build 
their own root systems in their 
neighborhoods and find their 
own identity within the game.”
After only one season of 
existence, Detroit United has 
had five of its student athletes 
commit to play lacrosse in 
college — all five having never 
played lacrosse one year prior.
Respectively, 
America 
and 
the lacrosse community have 
a long way to go to reverse the 
tides of institutionalized racism 
and inequality. But right now, 
as Mwangi says, the perfect 
storm 
has 
presented 
both 
with an opportunity to make a 
difference.
Whether or not they will, 
though, is up to them.
