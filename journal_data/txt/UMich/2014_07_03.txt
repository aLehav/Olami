Chemistry prof. earns
$1 million grant, set to
improve intro classes

DETROIT - Like most of the
places oo Lyodoo Street, Jody
Sackett's houose is small, white and
boxy. Her lawn is cut, the yard
filled with flowering shrubs. A
wooden bench sits under a large
tree.
But the story of Lyndon Street is
complicated. The house next door
is vacant. Plenty of structures are
visibly marked by blight -their
roofs caved in, shells scarred by
fire. A block over sits a tract of
empty land so vast that a fam-
ily uses it to ride their off-terrain
vehicles. Some of the residents
mow the grass in the vacant lots
near their homes just to keep their
stretch of street looking okay.
Detroit's blight problem is no
secret. But for years, community
organizations and city administra-
tions have struggled to find an ade-
quate approach to tackle an issue
spiraling so quickly out of control
- until last winter, when an army
of surveyors from Detroit's newly
convened Blight Removal Task
Force set out to catalog the condi-
tion of every single land parcel.
What they found is sure to
directly impact the city's efforts
to beat blight. But on top of that,
the report is also likely to color
the ways in which neighborhood
alliances, preservation networks,
urban planners and residents
think about their blocks and the
futures they'll have there.
Blank Canvas
Last fall, the Obama Admin-
istration helped establish a local
task force charged with develop-
ing a plan to remove every single
blighted parcel out of Detroit's
380,000 parcels of land, totaling
142 square miles.
In May, the Detroit Blight
Removal Task Force released a
prolific report not only detailing
the scope of the city's blight prob-
lem, but also laying out a set of
policy recommendations designed
to both keep blight from spread-
ing and tear down the houses
that couldn't be saved. The cost of
addressing blight on vacant lots,
residential structures and small
commercial buildings alone is

expected to top $850 million.
Of the parcels in that group,
40,077 structures and 6,135 vacant
lots require immediate attention
in the form of either demolition or
lot clean up. Another 38,429 struc-
tures display indicators of future
blight. The report estimates 80 to
90 percent of those buildings will
eventually face the wrecking ball.
All together, about 22 percent of
the city's land parcels have struc-
tures destined for demolition.
When the plan was presented
to the public and city officials last
month, Task Force co-chair Dan
Gilbert, the chairman of morty.
gage giant Quicken Loans, com-
pared blight to a malignant tumor
"because, like cancer, unless you
remove the entire tumor, blight
grows back."
Sean Jackson is the 25-year-old
Quicken Loans associate Gilbert
appointed to lead the Motor City
Mapping Project, the report's
mapping component. Jackson said
dealing with blight is in many ways
a precursor to improving most
everything else in the city, includ-
ing education, crime, unemploy-
ment and public health. Blight also
affects the city's image, especially
in the eyes of potential investors
and residents.
"Having this image of being the
blight porn city when people come
here and they want to go to the
Packard Plant and see the aban-
doned train station, that's not what
you want your city to be known
for," he said. "You want your city
to be known for its tech commu-
nity or its vibrant downtown or its
arts and culture - not for having a
ton of abandoned buildings in it."
Last winter, the Motor City
Mauctioning vacant homes at a
rate of two per day. Buyers are
required to occupy and fix-up
the house within six months of
purchase. Last week, the auction
reached $1 million in sales.
Claire Nowak-Boyd, the execu-
tive director of Preservation
Detroit, said her organization car-
ried out its own building survey
last year, in partto inform the land
bank of houses prime for restora-

tion.
While Jackson saiddmost of
the houses slated for demolition
are the poorly constructed, mid-
century box houses, Nowak-Boyd
argues there are still some older
houses subject to demolition that
deserve saving. Last week, the
Michigan Historic Preservation
Network released a video called
"Vacant, not Blighted."
"To look at every building as
blighted and needing to come
down is a mistake," said MHPN
preservation specialist Emilie
Evans.
In neighborhoods like the his-
toric, tree-lined Boston-Edison
neighborhood, the auctions are
helping stymie any hint of blight
by reoccupying the street's few
vacant houses.
"It keeps hope alive and it keeps
history alive," said Raquel Rob-
inson as she sipped a beer on the
porch of her childhood home on
Longfellow Street in Boston-Edi-
son.

HHMI awards
funds to-encourage
undergraduate
interest in science
By STEPHANIE SHENOUDA
ManagingEditor
The 2,000 students expected to
take Chemistry 211 next year are
in for a surprise.
Chemistry Prof. Anne McNeil
was recently awarded $1 million
from the Howard Hughes Medi-
cal Institute to improve under-
graduate chemistry education for
the coming academic year. McNeil
is one of 15 science educators to be
selected.
The institute's stated pur-
pose in funding each educator is
to encourage more students to
engage with science, math and
engineering and maintain Ameri-
can leadership in those fields.
McNeil's main focus with the
grantwill be revamping introduc-
tory chemistry courses at the Uni-
versity, namely Chemistry 211, an
introductory laboratory course,
which she believes are important
because they're required for many
science and engineering majors
and careers and are often stu-
dents' first experience in a scien-
tific lab setting.
McNeil has observed that 37
percent of students changed their
course of study after taking intro-
ductory chemistry courses, which
she attributed to the class's cur-

rent nature.
"Chem 211is a class that mostly
freshmen take, either first semes-
ter or after they take General
Chemistry," she said. "The general
consensus is that the class is kind
of boring and not challenging,
because it can be a recap of what
students have already learned in
high school, and many people lose
interest."
McNeil said students' first lab
experience should be engaging
because it's crucial for success and
eventual advancement in a pleth-
ora of careers. She added that she
doesn't want students to decide
against being doctors because
they didn't enjoy their first chem-
istry class freshman year.
Though time and large enroll-
ment numbers have proved to be
an obstacle in the past, McNeil
plans to make the lab an oppor-
tunity for students to get excited
about chemistry by allowingthem
the chance to make and test more
of their own original hypotheses
and creating lab exercises with
more practical application, so
they're more relevant to students'
lives. One of the experiments
she anticipates will be popular
involves converting vegetable oil
used in restaurants into biodiesel.
While a large portion of higher
education funding is generally
allocated for graduate students,
McNeil said she believes invest-
ing in undergraduate education
is important because it's the time
that studentsbegin fostering their
interests and deciding on careers.

Union unveils plaque honoring Coleman

University president
recognized for years
of service, student
life initiatives
By ALLANA AKHTAR
Daily News Editor
Tuesday, outgoing Univer-
sity President Mary Sue Coleman
stood in the Michigan Union and
watched as two students cut a rib-
bon to unveil her plaque on the
wall next to a long list of former
University presidents.
"Coleman, a biochemist,
always focused on the University
of tomorrow," the plaque reads.
"Popular with students, she led
during the worst economic down-
fall since the Depression, with new
faculty hires, greater interdisci-
plinary teaching and research, a
vibrant entrepreneurial culture,
major building and residential
life projects and the $3.2 billion
Michigan Difference Campaign. A
strong advocate of diversity in the
classroom, she launched academic
partnership on three continents."
The tradition of honoring Uni-
versity presidents on the Union
wall began in 1994, on the 90th
anniversary celebration of the

Michigan Union.
Susan Pile, director of the.
Michigan Union, said she, the
Michigan Union Board of Repre-
sentatives and Coleman's office
had been organizingthe ceremony
for many months. She lauded the
outgoing president's achievements
and tradition of excellence of the
University she has continued.
"putting all of her accomplish-
ments into such few words was
a real art," Pile said. "We're just
honored to be able to honor her."
LSA senior Kendall Johnson,
a member of the Michigan Union
Board of Representatives, spoke
at the ceremony about the Union's
rich history in supporting student
involvement and campus harmony.
Johnson also drew on the sig-
nificance of Coleman's status as
the first female president of the
University, leading the way for
future diversity in the school lead-
ership.
"There is also significance
in adding a woman to the wall,
especially a woman of integrity,
responsibility, wisdom and deter-
mination," Johnson said. "The
legacy she leads will continue to
inspire us for many years to come."
University alum Adam Kleven,
a former MUBR chair, also spoke
about the outgoing president's
commitment to students and stu-

dent life at the ceremony.
Kleven said though studies are
important at the University, expe-
riences outside the classroom are
the ones that trulybenefit students
in their lives after college.
"Places like the Michigan
Union, the Big House, the rec
sports buildings, the dorms, those
are the places that students will
remember," he said.
Kleven mentioned several ini-
tiatives Coleman undertook to
improve student life, including
an investment of $170 million in
renovations to campus facilities.
Over her tenure, Coleman pursued
a residential life initiative to reno-
vate and reconstruct residential
halls on campus, such as South
Quad, Alice Lloyd and Mosher-
Jordan.
He also touched on her fireside
chats, held in the Union, during
which would answer student ques-
tions and try to keep her admin-
istration's actions transparent.
Kleven said these chats demon-
strated the president's willingness
to connect with students and hear
their concerns.
"While President Coleman is
also leaving some big shoes to fill,
I also think that she has laid the
groundwork for a future where
Michigan will remain a top-tier
university and a university dedi-

cated to its students," he said.
After the unveiling of the
plaque, Coleman also men-
tioned her efforts to improve
and develop student life through
the facilities they used, whether
classrooms, residence halls or the
Union itself.
"I am so happy that under the
leadership of Royster Harper,
(vice president of student life),
that we were able to come to an
accommodation so that this icon-
ic building will be preserved for
the future," said Coleman. "When
I talked to alumni, whether they
were from the last few years,
twenty, thirty, forty, fifty years
ago, they remember this as being
a part of the campus."
The Michigan Union began as
an all-male organization to foster
a sense of unity among students.
The Union building that resides
on State Street was once the loca-
tion of the house of former Judge
Thomas M. Cooley. His house was
demolished in 1916 and the Union
opened in 1919.
The original Union housed a
bowling alley, barbershop and
swimming pool. Today, the build-
ing is used as office space for
various student organizations,
numerous fast food restaurants
and cafes, study rooms and con-
ference areas.

"We also beefed up the com-
6 4 5 3 munication plan so that people
know that this should not affect
6 7 post-game traffic, because prior
to the meeting, we found out
that many people were under the
7 8 assumption that it was going to
impact post game traffic, which
it should not," Seto said. "One of
the biggest issues is that people
4 2 9 6 go out the way they came in, not
realizing that Main Street is open
and would be a more expedient
15 4 way to leave the city."
Seto said further conversa-
4 8tion would be had about what
changes needed to be made to the
current traffic control plans in
5 preparation for the August 2 soc-
cer game between Manchester
8 1 6 2 United and Real Madrid, which
may pose different issues than a
football game.
"I've been told that as far as
the soccer game, there is more

of a likelihood that the game will
be closer in score, so people will
stay until the end of the game,
unlike a football game where the
score could be more lopsided," he
said.
Neighborhood disturbance
was also cited as a problem dur-
ing the meeting, specifically
when game attendants use them
as shortcuts to avoid traffic.
Another nuisance mentioned was
the potential danger and annoy-
ance of overhead helicopters in
residential areas.
Seto said he could not imple-
ment significant changes to State
Street or nearby side streets
because of the limited number of
officers.
"It's a balance between secu-
rity and inconvenience," he said.
Along with several city resi-
dents, Councilmembers Jack
Eaton (D-Ward 4) and Jane
Lumm (I-Ward 2) were in atten-
dance at the meeting. The street
closure resolution will be pre-
sented to them and the rest of
city council July 7 for approval.

Nik Stauskas: 8th overall
(Sacramento Kings)
NEW YORK - Nik Stauskas may
have joked before that he wanted
to play with LeBron James. But
the Sacramento Kings had bigger
things in mind for him, makinghim
Michigan's highest draft pick in 14
years.
With the eighth pick in the 2014
NBA Draft, the Kings selected the
former Michigan guard, making
him the highest Michigan player
selected since Jamal Crawford was
selected eighth overall in the 2000
draft.
"I can't really put this into
words," Stauskas said in his first
official press conference. "I'm just
excited to be a Sacramento King.
I've only heard good things about
the city and the organization, so
I'm excited to getto work."
The selection marks the second
straight year a former Wolverine
has been picked in the top 10. In
2013, the Minnesota Timberwolves
selected Trey Burke with the ninth
pick before trading him to the Utah
Jazz later that night.
For a team that selected a shoot-
ing guard in last year's draft in for-
mer Kansas player Ben McLemore,
it will be interesting to see if Staus-
kas will come off the bench or be a
starter. Regardless, Stauskas will
provide some relief to a team that
finished tied for 27th in 3-point
shooting last season (33 percent).
After sitting at his draft night
table with his agent, parents,
brother and Michigan coach John
Beilein, Stauskas unleashed ahand-
shake with his father to express his
gratitude for his night of nerves
finally being over. Though Stauskas
was nervous his father might get it
wrong, he ultimately got it right.
"It was planned last night,"
Stauskas said. "I always throw up
the three-goggles, so I thought it
was more appropriate to do it here."
Mitch McGary: 21st overall
(Oklahoma City Thunder)
With the 21st pick in the 2014
NBA Draft, the Oklahoma City
Thunder selected the former Wol-
verines forward.

Rumors floated around heading
into Thursday night that McGary
had a first-round promise from a
team. More rumors indicated that
team was the Charlotte Hornets
with the 24th pick. As it turned
out, McGary did have a first-round
suitor, and Michigan coach John
Beilein knew before anyone else.
Not known for tweeting, Beilein
beat all the media to the scoop,
tweeting out minutes before
the selection, "Another Wolver-
ine about to go up on the board.
#GoBlue #WeWork"
And wouldn't you know it,
Beilein was correct. Acting as an
oracle, Beilein predicted what
NBA Commissioner Adam Silver
announced from the stage.
Meanwhile, McGary will bring
a physical presence to an already
strong Thunder team. Anchored
by Kevin Durant and Russell West-
brook, Oklahoma City fell two wins
short of the NBA Finals.
Though it remains to be seen
how long it will take McGary to
get back to 100 percent, as he is
still recovering from lower back 41
surgery in January, the Thunder
clearly think McGary's aggressive,
fast-paced offense will fit in.
Glenn Robinson III: 40th overall
(Minnesota Timberwolves)
NEW YORK - As the end of the
2014 NBA Draft first round came to
a close, it started to become more
and more unclear where Glenn
Robinson III would land.
Then, all of a sudden, his named
was announced, andthe Minnesota
Timberwolves acquired his rights
with the 40th pick.
Robinson's name first came up
as a possible 29th pick of the Okla-
homa City Thunder, who had pre-
viously selected former Michigan
forward Mitch McGary with the
21st pick. Instead, the Thunder
selected former Stanford forward
Josh Huestis.
With the San Antonio Spurs
up next, a team projected in some
mock drafts to take Robinson,
speculation remained as to wheth-
er Michigan would have three first
round picks.
Of course, not only did Robinson
fall out of the first round, he fell nine
more picks until Minnesota finally
swooped in to pick up Robinson.

NEW YORK - What
Nstarted as a table of six
was down to one.
For more than four hours,
John Beilein

there, waiting,
hoping for each
of his former D 'I

He knew
Stauskas would

when the Sacramento Kings

Beilein stood and applauded.
"It was great," Beilein said. "We

to have them be in this situation,
none of us could have ever

well for him. It's a little bit of a

With one player down, he
collected a Kings hat and waited
for his next player to be selected.
Throughout the night,
if you were followingthe

expecting Yahoo Sports' Adrian

Was he trolling Twitter? Or did he

"We talk to a lot of people in

said after the fact. "When you talk

A passenger pigeon specimen on display in the University's Museum of Natural History

Once abundant,
demise tells story
of human impact on
the environment
By IAN DILLINGHAM
Editor in Chief
In 1800, the world's human
population had yet to hit one bil-
lion. However, in North America,
it was estimated that there were
between three and five billion
passenger pigeons. Now extinct,
the species is making its post-
humous resurgence at museums
around the country this year,
including one in Ann Arbor.
September 1 will mark the hun-
dredth anniversary ofthe death of
the passenger pigeon Martha, the
last known living member of her
species. In remembrance of the
event, the University's Museum of
Natural History is opening a new
exhibit chronicling the life and
demise of the species.
The exhibit will focus on the
species' presence and subsequent
extinction, as well as its impact
specifically in the state of Michi-
gan. However, the ornitholo-
gists and environmentalists who
pushed for its development also
wanted to demonstrate a broad-
er theme about the historically
destructive tendencies of human
behavior in North America.
Eugene Dillenburg, assistant
director for exhibits at the Muse-
um of Natural History, said the
story of the bird could serve as a
lesson - and a warning - of the
potential for humans to drastical-

ly impact the environment around
them.
Starting in the 1800s, settlers
in the eastern United States began
hunting the pigeons, primarily for
their meat. While the birds had
previously been hunted by Native
Americans, the increased strain
on the population from the set-
tlers led to their rapid demise.
"It was an abundant and cheap
source of protein," Dillenburg
said. "Free food from the sky - so
in the space of about 40 years it
was hunted to extinction."
By about 1880, the pigeon,
which by many accounts was the
most abundant bird on the planet
at the beginning of the century,
was hunted to virtual extinction.
The few living specimens were
primarily confined to zoos and
private sanctuaries as individu-
als began to realize the lasting
impact of such hunting practices.
However, efforts to revitalize
the population proved fruitless.
Martha, who was believed to be
the last living member of the spe-
cies, died at the Cincinnati Zoo on
September 1, 1914.
Dillenburg compared the rapid
extinction to "waking up one
morning and finding that all the
trees in Michigan were gone."
"A lot of animals have gone
extinct over time," Dillenburg
said. "What's unique about the
pigeon - other than going from
the most numerous animal to
extinction - is that we know the
date. So often an animal becomes
rarer and rarer and, at some point,
people say, 'We haven't seen one
in a while; it must have gone
extinct.' Here we know the exact
date that the last one died."

The exhibit features artistic
panels by Art and Design alum
Kaisa Ryding. She got involved
with the project during her stud-
ies at the University and worked
on the design over the course of
several months.
"My experience with the proj-
ect allowed me to truly under-
stand the impact of human
development on wildlife and the
environment, and how important
conservation of native wildlife is
to local ecologies," Ryding wrote
in a statement. "Humans really
did have a direct and harmful
impact on the passenger pigeon,
and did so out of ignorance of
how much they could decimate its
population."
Though a small contingent
of conservationists attempted
to stop hunting efforts as the
pigeon's population began to
drop, scientists now believe the
abundance of the specices was
key to its survival. Once its num-
bers began to fall, the birds may
have been doomed to their inevi-
table demise.
"The passenger pigeons relied
on their large populations so
much that when their population
was reduced to the thousands,
they could not function as a flock,
and very quickly died out after
that," Ryding wrote.
Despite this theory, some sci-
entists are exploring radical new
measures to resurrect the species
dubbed "de-extinction" projects.
Using genetic sequences acquired
through samples taken from pre-
served passenger pigeon speci-
mens, these researchers believe
they can, over time, reintroduce

Drying out Detroit
DWSD must keep the citizens in mind when collecting funds
n Monday, the National Action Network Detroit Chapter
and several other community activists from Detroit
gathered in front of Republican Gov. Rick Snyder's office
to protest the controversial water shut-offs in the city. Starting in
March, the Detroit Water and Sewage Department began sending
shut-off notices to 46,000 customers whose bills remained unpaid.
On June 25, the United Nations condemned DWSD's cutoffs as
an "affront to human rights." While it's important that DWSD
receives funds to make up for their deficit, the department must
also keep the lives of Detroit residents in mind when implementing
programs to collect water bills.

It's understandable that
DWSD needs to collect money
to continue funding water
services, and in light of $120
million in unpaid water bills,
the company must take action
to correct this problem.
However, shutting off
citizens' water, a basic human
need, isn't an appropriate
solution. Sue McCormick,
DWSD director, stated the
majority of unpaid water
bills stem from residents
who can afford to pay but
believe they can get away
without paying their bills.
McCormick also expressed
the company's willingness
to help anyone legitimately
unable to afford the cost.
Therefore, DWSD must take
an aggressive approach to
pursue contact with non-
paying customers to discover
each person's circumstances
and appropriately handle each
case accordingly. If contacting

each customer fails to help,
DWSD must take other actions
- like requesting mayoral or
governmental assistance - in
solving payment issues.
During DWSD's initiative
to shut off water, the Detroit
City Council recently passed
a bill to increase water bills
by nearly 9 percent. At $75 a
month, the average Detroit
water bill is nearly double
the U.S. average. Poverty-
stricken citizens shouldn't
face an unreasonable cost
for a basic human necessity,
especially given the council's
justification for the increase.
According to the Lansing
State Journal, the increase
stems from delinquent bills,
yet increasing a cost because
some can't pay causes a
repetitive cycle. Those
unable and unwilling to pay
their water bill will continue
avoiding payments while the
city will continue raising

water rates. This reality sets
a precedent that punishes
complying citizens, and
with higher bills come more
citizens unable to pay their
bills which increases the risk
of water being shut off.
While the nearly 9
percent increase fails to
correct delinquencies, it
also furthers the poverty
that struggling residents
experience. While five dollars
more a month towards water
may not be much for some
citizens, this increase is a
significant amount to lower
socioeconomic families -
particularlythose who already
can't pay their bills. Adding
the risk of water being shut off
only increases the stress that
citizens experience. While
programs are beginning to
help citizens, DWSD must
make sure all struggling
families receive assistance
and access to water.

sleep deprivation, but the message came
through loud and clear: trauma patient
en route to the hospital.
In the emergency
department, the team
of nurses, paramedics Ve did e
and physicians donned
protective equipment, we cou
talked idly and teased
one another about was all t
the quiet shift thus
far. The office water- tOO
cooler chatter died
abruptly as the doors
slammed open. In
rushed a stretcher bearing a shapeless
figure, whisked immediately into the
waiting trauma bay. A flurry of activity
ensued as each person set to his or her
assigned task, starting intravenous
lines and placing monitors toward the
woman's head, while at her feet we
began shredding clothing and searching
for pulses. Yet even an inexperienced
third-year medical student could see
it was all wrong, pressures too low,
wounds too many.
We did everything we could,
but ultimately it was too little, too
late. Eventually the order came to
halt chest compressions, signaling
the end of resuscitative efforts. It
was several more seconds before I
realized that this was the first time I
had ever witnessed someone's death.
The attending trauma surgeon must
have recognized the look on my face
- started my way, mouth hanging
halfway open as if to speak - but
just then a dozen pagers on a dozen
hips began to chirp in crazed, chaotic
cacophony: rollover accident, two
injured, estimated time of arrival...
At the Veterans of America hospital
months later, I was assigned to care
for a salty, middle-aged veteran with
terminal cancer. Agonized by constant
pain, bones riddled with tumors,
his sole remaining pleasure in life
seemed to be the daily haranguing of
his medical student. After weeks of
struggling, I finally managed to win his

grudging respect only after discovering
that he had taken to hoarding pudding
cups in his room. By unspoken accord,
I ensured that any wayward desserts
found their way into his drawer, and
in return, he directed his ire towards
others on occasion.
On the penultimate morning of my
tenure at the VA, I went to restock
the secret stash of sweets only to
find the vet's bed strangely empty.
When I asked if the patient was in the
restroom, his nurse looked puzzled for
a moment before casually responding,
"Oh, he died."
Oh, he died. An offhand quip, but
words that sank into me, weighed
heavily on my chest, dense as lead,
inert as stone. This was neither the
time nor the place
for contemplation,
e rt n since there was
Verytingii~ much work to be
ld but it done, as always.
More importantly,
too little, I had a phone call
to make, because
late. the responsibility
of informing the
late vet's mother
fell to me. She had
been planning on visiting later in the
day - how could I ever tell her this
grim news now? Whatever I had to
say, it would be heartbreakingly too
little, too late.
On alate winter's morning, the "code"
team responded to an emergency in the
University Hospital. I followed the feet
of the senior resident ahead of me as he
flew down the stairs, two steps at a time,
while I awkwardly half-stumbled and
half-fell behind him. Despite our best
efforts, the patient did not survive the
resuscitation.
I had just witnessed my second
death of the week. As for total number
seen as a medical student, I had long
ago stopped counting. Somewhere
deep down, I thought that I might
have felt a slight stirring where my
heart once resided, but it passed
quickly enough.
One of the attending physicians took
notice of me, led me aside, away from
the commotion in the area of the now-
deceased individual. He threw his
arm around my shoulders, gave me the
old "You Can't Save Them All" speech
and encouraged me to contact him if
I needed to debrief or decompress.
It was a great talk, emphatically and
admirably delivered, from-the-heart
and perfect for the situation.
It was also too little, too late.

various instru-
ments that com- Weird World
pose the album's
twelve tracks. But
don't get me wrong, "What Is This
Heart?" is a lovely record that com-
bines various influences, namely
R&B, hip hop and indie, to create
an emotional, dreamy album that
avoids being dramatic.
Most every song on the record
has a very loose, serene feel to it and
"Repeat Pleasure," is no exception.
It starts off lightly, with acoustic
guitar strumming and keyboards
that could easily double as the
intro to a chick-flick. Krell's fragile
voice enters the track, and the song
transforms into a smooth stream of
music. Snare beats seem to line the
borders of the song, preventing its
peripheral elements from drifting
too far off from the centerpiece that
is Krell's singing.
If I didn't pay close attention
to the lyrics and instruments of

Tom Krell, the man behind How to Dress Well
"What Is This Heart?"

"Repeat Pleasure," as well as most
trackson "What Is ThisHeart?,"they
would all blend together, but not in a
forgettable way. "See You Fall" pos-
sessesvery calmingqualities for this
same reason. The violin intro gives
off a feeling of mourning, but the
accompanying strings counter this
sadness by providing an upbeat feel.
The tranquility of Krell's high pitch
vocals keep the song afloat, prevent-
ing "See You Fall" from drifting
away into sadness, creating a driv-
ing balance that sustains a blissful
feelingthroughout the track.
"A Power" is one of the album's
more sentimental songs. Krell dis-
cusses all sorts of emotions, finding
ways to discuss common themes of
being a good, loving person while
avoiding sappy, cookie-cutter
bullshit. Lyrics like "I want to be
sympathy, went to seek sympathy, I
want to die in peaceful quiet," seem
to procure real feelings from Krell,
and frantic piano notes are a nice
touch.
"Face Again," stands in direct
contrast to the fluffier "A Power."
Unlike most songs on the album, the
track has many lower tones that give
a haunting, eerie vibe to the song.
A demonic, low-pitch voice echoes
and responds Krell's vocals, possi-
bly delving into his inner conscious.
Powerful bass and feedback noises
pulse throughout the song, painting
a mental picture of a dim light flick-
ering on and off during the climax
of ahorror movie. Interjected sound
bites furtherthe trippynature of the
song.
The song finally lightens up when
Krell muses "I don't know what's
best for me," which seems to sup-
port the idea that the demonic voice

might represent some internal or
external voice pushing him away
from such a loving, optimistic exis-
tence.
In "What You Wanted," the use
of brass instruments in the back-
ground a strong snare and drum
beat in the foreground, in combi-
nation with Krell's smooth vocals,
work to showcase the R&B influ-
ences of "What Is This Heart?."
After a funny accordion sampled
intro, "Very Best Friend" develops
a steady clapping beat that seems
very true to hip hop, but maintains
a secondary electronic feel with the
accordion sample.
These two songs find their pri-
mary influences in R&B and Hip
Hop respectively, but that is not to
say that songs like "Precious Love,"
"Words I Don't Remember," and
many more don't take influence
from both. To be honest, "Words
I Don't Remember" is so smooth,
with a catchy, basic beat and some
fun samplings, thatIcould easilysee
it being played in a club setting. The
fact that Krell's voice is both high
pitch and smooth is definitely a tes-
tament to his vocal abilities.
In true indie spirit, Krell decid-
ed to release "What Is This Heart?"
on the album's website prior to its
release date (supposedly) without
getting permission from his label,
Weird World Releases. Whether
or not he had permission or not is
irrelevant to the album, because as
far as I'm concerned this master-
piece should sell. The far-reaching
influences of the songs make it eas-
ily enjoyable to fans of many genres
that surprisingly flow together
uninterrupted throughout the
record.

One of the most striking aspects
of the President's House, currently
the oldest building on campus, is
the way it blends the past and pres-
ent.
In the hallways, original aspects
of the architecture mix with the
type of industrial fire alarms you'd
find in University buildings on
campus. When it was decided that
the the study needed new win-
dows to be more energy efficient
as part of the ongoing, $1.3 mil-
lion renovation project, architects
planned to build them inside of
the original ones, in a compromise
between preservation and utility.
In the bathrooms, the electricity
outlets are updated to comply with
code - the bathtubs, showers, and

counters themselves mostly stay
the same.
During a tour of the house,
Henry Baier, associate vice presi-
dent for facilities and operations,
said for the most part, the focus
of renovations has been on main-
taining the historic nature of the
exterior while still updating the
interior, a balance he acknowl-
edged isn't always easy. When bal-
ancing between the two, he said
safety, energy efficiency, and cost
are top factors.
Renovations are expected to be
completed by the end of this sum-
mer, though they won't be done
in time for Schlissel officially

Thus far, Baier said, the project has
been proceeding on track.

with a watery rage. I have biceps. I
clip my nails. I have hair that tussles
down a wide back. I'm twenty years
old, and I'm frequently pegged by
others as "cute."
Cuteness and smallness are
terms that are shoved into my
world often - by strangers, friends,
peers. They're not intended as
insults. After all, I'm five feet tall.
I write poems. I eat sugar. I wear
children's size Nike sneakers.
Fireflies light me up with glee.
Still, the project of naming
others can become one-
dimensional, squashing down,
rather than lifting up.
The word "cute" has its rightful
place. In the daycare center where
I work, we circulate the word
frequently. Cute kids. Cute bangs
and lost babyteeth. Cute Lego blocks
shaped into castles and crayons.
At my other job waiting tables, we
discuss cuteness in the context of
the elderly woman who slides into
the restaurant in plum-colored shoes
and matching sunglasses, dicing her
dill pickle with a fork. Cute baby on

the patio,mashinghis macaroniwith
a fat fist. Cute dog slurping from the
waterbowl. Cute, waggingtail.
For all the times I'm forecast with
the word "cute," cutenessitselfseems
foreign to me. "Cute" doesn't strut.
"Cute" doesn't drink its chocolate
milkshake with bare feet, perched
by the electric socket in July heat.
"Cute" doesn't place its hand on its
hip, talking back. There seemsto be a
strange glossiness that accompanies
cuteness. What is nonthreatening,
easily cooed at, easily pet on the head
- that's cute.
As a "petite" Asian-American
woman, I find itincrediblyimportant
to redefine my own sense of space.
I find it urgent to shout, to bust out
of the words I'm given or made to
wear. There's wonder in shaping
the world with my own two hands:
Why "cute"? Why "small"? When
frozen in these words, how can I do
my own kind of snipping? How can I
uncover? How canI groove or glow?
Instead of settling into these
names, it's important that we
roll into and out of them. The
practice of naming with language
has such a slow-churned power
- it's important that we don't
retreat. I aim to challenge myself
to twist these words inside-out.
Smallness, cuteness - I fall into
that, and so much more. For me,
what's intriguing is that these
terms have never aligned with
how I feel. So the bigger project
becomes navigating a world where
I am seen as X, but shimmy into Y.
While, at times, it's frustrating to
be pinned down into these terms,
I also find that it introduces a sense
of awe into my own work and the
ways I practice self-care. I appreciate
moments of self-hugeness much,
much more. I ask questions. I can be
cute or small, but I can also brim full
of sass, song, trouble. In cuteness, in
smallness - I do notrest. I amout-of-
breath,lIrun, I marvel.
In a writing prompt, the poet
Shira Erlichman encourages others
to, "Snatch a potent name back from
the air. (...) How do you make or
re-make it? Shake the snowglobe of
the name: what floats, what sinks?"
For me, "cute" and "small"
give me opportunities to claim
mightiness and power in
revolutionary ways. I can be cute,
but I can also be dimensional. I
can name myself - loud-mouthed,
long-haired, tall-hearted, giant in
wonder, giant in love.

Unpaid,
A s a society, we've
generally accepted the
institution of unpaid
student
labor. Many
students,
especially
those
from less
privileged
backgrounds,
struggle with
choosing ZAK
between paid WITUS
jobs that
benefit them
more immediately and unpaid
jobs that benefit them more in
the future. As it is, we accept
that universities don't pay most
students who assist with their
research, and that companies
don't pay most of their student-
interns. But why? There's no
good reason for students to
accept that they won't be paid
for their labor. The struggle
between choosing unpaid versus
paid work is unnecessary if
students opt instead to struggle
against the employers who
believe it's acceptable not to pay
students for their labor.
Many employers claim that
the special advantages of unpaid
student jobs for the students
justify the absence of wages.
Internships and university-
based research assistance
appear to be the most popular
kinds of unpaid student jobs.
Most students want to intern
with certain companies or assist
with university research because
these jobs are in the students'
professional fields of interest and
will therefore help them achieve
their career goals. By interning
and/or researching, students
can gain specialized academic
knowledge as well as develop
professional skills, such as
researching techniques, writing,

'I Sing the Forest Electric': EF14's Two Distinct Subcultures

Annual music
festival in Rothbury
MI is decadent, but
not depraved
By GIANCARLO BUONOMO
ManagingArts Editor
"Unlike most of the others, we
didn't give a hoot in hell what
was happening on the track. We
had come there to watch the real
beasts perform."
- Hunter S. Thompson, "The
Kentucky Derby is Decadent and
Depraved."
Please forgive this predict-
able Hunter S. Thompson refer-
ence for a "Look Ma, I covered
a music festival!" article. I only
include it to admit at the start
that I was wrong. I figured I
would go to Electric Forest as
a reporter. While my co-editor
Adam covered the music, I would
observe the festivalgoers, "the
real beasts," and report on their
depraved excesses. There would
be me, with my media bracelet
and plaid shirt, furiously jot-
ting down notes, and then there

would be everyone else - the
legions of electro-junkies in
funny hats who eat tabs of acid
like Listerine Strips. I imagined
calling this article "Electric For-
est is Decadent and Depraved."
Most of my preconceptions
were based on rumors about
Electric Forest; that it was much
more than a music festival, that
it had the best people-watching
ever, that it was trippier than
an MGMT video. These rumors
were believable, considering that
Electric Forest takes place in
rural :Rothbury, Michigan, spe-
cializes in the relatively niche
genres of jam bands and elec-
tronic music and that the "forest"
is an actual forest, so decked out
with lights, lasers and shrines
that it recalls something from
Alice in Wonderland.
In truth, none of the rumors
turned out to be false. But now
that I've returned from Roth-
bury, and gone over the pages of
notes and hours of recordings I
accumulated during my time at
the festival, I cannot write this
report with my original focus.
Not because I feel the need to
write about the music, even
though it was amazing. Rather,

because I discovered that Elec-
tric Forest is less about the peo-
ple who choose to come than it
is about what this peculiar event
allows those people, including
me, to become.
Electric Forest is not so much
a music festival as it is a four
day act of collective weirdness,
heavily facilitated by the festi-
val organizers and sustained by
a pervasive spirit of community
and non-judgement. I began to
get an idea of this right when we
arrived at the camp grounds. The
actual festival area, the stages
and vendors, is located on the
Double JJ Resort, a sort of Wild-
West re-enactment spot heav-
ily repurposed for one weekend
every year. The attendees camp
out in a complex of fields adja-
cent to the resort. These fields
form a small city during the
weekend, complete with named
streets and neighborhoods. From
my berth at the corner of "Air-
strip" and "Maple", I gazed out
upon the expanse. Thousands of
parked cars in neat rows, most
with colorful tents next to them,
filled the once-empty space like
a psychedelic Hooverville. These
people were clearly pros - many
tents were adorned with ban-
ners and flagpoles featuring the
logos of the classics: The Grate-
ful Dead, Bob Marley, Sublime,
all fragrant with years of accu-
mulated incense and ganja.
But it was inside the actu-
al festival, a good ten minute
walk from our campsite, that I
finally encountered the masses
of people. I'd never seen such a
dazzling array of outfits. Some
attendees were dressed in stan-
dard music-festival attire: girls
in Daisy Dukes and flower head-
bands, guys in tank tops and
flat-brims. But they were the
minority. Some men wore top
hats and tight suits like the Mad
Hatter, and some girls wore only
bikini bottoms with fanny-pack
codpieces and painted marijuana
leaves covering the tips of their
otherwise bare breasts. Others
wore Teletubbie or bear outfits,
or giant Pikachu heads. One man
I passed on Saturday wore only a
Speedo and a small silver crown

fixed to his head at a rakish angle,
while sucking on a large lollipop.
Another was so adorned with rib-
bons, beads and feathers that he
resembled an Aztec god.
But the decadence doesn't stop
there. Many festivalgoers carry
totems, which are long poles with
anything on top. And I mean any-
thing. Blow-up sex dolls. Bill Mur-
ray's face. Simpsons characters. I
saw one depicting a cartoon King
of Kings, with a Mr. Skin-esque
grin, and the words "PRAISE
CHEEZUS" in big block let-
ters, likely in honor of the String
Cheese Incident's combined 12
hours of stagetime.
And of course, drugs. They're
an essential part of the festival,
so ubiquitous and accepted that
one pizza vendor put up a sign
that read "DON'T FORM LINES.
LINES ARE FOR YOUR NOSE,
NOT SPICY PIE." I'm watching
Ms. Lauryn Hill and a guy to my
left lights up a joint the size of a
Sharpie. I'm raving along at Zedd,
and a guy to my right vacuums a
good quarter-teaspoon of coke
into his left nostril.
This overwhelming amount
of, well, everything made me
wonder "Is this where all the
weirdos gather? Or is this where
people gather to be weird?" I've
concluded that it's the latter. Of
course, I don't think that Elec-
tric Forest is where Mormon
missionaries and Goldman Sachs
executives congregate to let
loose, but I did get the impres-
sion that Electric Forest provides
a safe environment for ordinary
people to abandon mainstream
mores for a weekend. A guy in a
hammock put it best in a remark
to another guy in the hammock
strung below his: "I'm going
hard tomorrow, because I have
to go back to reality after that."
Electric Forest is not only a
retreat from "normalcy," but also
an oasis of kindness and together-
ness. Festivalgoers go out of their
way to accommodate each other.
One girl entered a Port-A-Potty
after a long wait in line, only to
burst out and run after the previ-
ous occupant who had dropped a
$5 bill. During a packed perfor-
mance by Steve Angello, another

girl got tired and decided to sit
down right in the middle of the
crowd. Everyone, even those
wildly dancing while rolling,
made sure to give her space.
At an event like this, people
make themselves vulnerable by
dressing in shocking and reveal-
ing ways, taking mind-bending
substances, and then walking
around an environment that is
confusing even if sober. To have a
good time requires a level of trust
on everyone's part, that their
fellow attendees will not take
advantage of them, and will even
help them out if need be.
I experienced this trust first-
hand. On Saturday, I was sitting
in the crowd at the Sherwood
stage, vibing to Schoolboy Q and
takingnotes. I struck up a conver-
sation with a couple sitting near
me, Nick and Kat from Louisville.
We chatted about Electric Forest
and why people would come here.
"We're all here for the same
thing: music and good people,"
Nick said.
As a red-shirted security
guard walked around inquiring
whether the numerous people
smoking joints had medical per-
mits, I remarked to Nick that I
didn't usually strike up conver-
sations at concerts.
"But at a place like this you
should never feel like you can't
talk to anybody," he replied. "
You can go up to anybody and be
like 'Hey, what's up?"'
At that moment, I saw a friend
about 15 feet away, one who
I hadn't talked to in awhile. I
immediately leapt up and moved
towards her, forgetting that my
phone, backpack and notebook
were still on the ground next
to Nick and Kat. I looked back
anxiously, and they motioned
towards my things and gave me
a thumbs up, indicating that they
would watch over them. Leaving
your stuff with strangers prob-
ably isn't something to make a
habit of. But as Doctor Thomp-
son said, "When the going gets
weird, the weird turn pro." The
going at Electric Forest is defi-
nitely weird - I viewed them
watching my stuff as a matter of
professional courtesy.

EDM-loving, Molly-
popping kids overlap
with older, jam-
band hippies
By ADAM THEISEN
SeniorArts Editor
Friday night at Electric Forest,
Ms.Lauryn Hill,The String Cheese
Incident and Zedd performed con-
secutively on the same stage. For
an idea of how strangely those art-
ists fit together, imagine watching
a triple feature at a movie theater
of "Do the Right Thing," "For-
rest Gump" and "Spring Break-
ers." It was the same on Saturday
night, with hippie jam-band String
Cheese beingsandwiched between
the reggae of Stephen Marley and
EDM star Steve Angello.
The cultures of most music fes-
tivals can easily be described with
one or two adjectives = urban Lol-
lapalooza, rural Bonnaroo, glitzy
Coachella - but what was most
interesting about Electric Forest
was that two entirely different
subcultures coexisted, without
ever really having to cross paths
through the entire weekend.
There were the hippies who came
to smoke and drop acid (or what-
ever is was that was that people
were calling "acid") and see the
jam bands (traditionally the most
disrespected, most uncool kind of
band), and there were the EDM
kids, who mostly seemed college-
aged and came to take Molly and
party like the farmland of Roth-
bury, Michigan was one gigantic
frat house.
Our first real encounter with
anyone at the festival came as we
were still in our car, waiting to
get in. A woman probably in her
20s came up to the open window.
"Have you guys seen Cheese yet?"
she asked. "Nah, but we're excited
to." "Right on, so you haven't had,
like, an 'Incident' yet. I've seen
them six times already. They're my
favorite band in the world, and I'm
trying to see them again tonight."
She asked us for money to help her
buy a ticket, but when we told her
wedidn't have any cash, she stayed
extraordinarily positive. "That's
all right, 'cause I just need positive
vibes, and just knowing that you
guys are sending me goodenergy
and feelings is gonna help me out."
If you try to talk to any "serious"
music fan about the relevance of

The String Cheese .Incident, he or
she will likely laugh in your face
(before this weekend, I would've
done this, too, if I'm being honest).
Jam bands, as a whole and almost
without exception, are thought
of as goofy and toothless. Critics
think of jam bands and they hear
echoes of 10-minute wandering
guitar solos and picture an older,
granola munching fanbase. But
while "the establishment" may
immediately dismiss them, to
many people, The String Cheese
Incident is the biggest band in
their world. Our North Dakotan
neighbors at the camp site, for
instance, had traveled all the way
to Michigan to see "Cheese and
whoever else."
I was ready to see what all the
fuss is about. On Friday, after Ms.
Lauryn Hill showed up late (as
usual) but still put on a thrilling,
energetic performance, Cheese
went on stage.
Frankly, I was bored. Maybe I
had set my expectations too high,
maybe I should've listened to them
beforehand to know what I was
going to hear, but the band just
seemed average to me. I decided
that the specialness was in the
minds of the fans and not in the
music, so I left and wandered the
festival.
When I got back to the stage
where Cheese was still playing,
though, I was intrigued. The band
was in the middle of a fiddle solo,
which usually doesn't seize my
attention, but something about the
energy of the crowd excited me.
As they kept playing, I waited out
the parts where I had previously
gotten bored and listened as they
slowly but surely built up into tow-
ering, awesome crescendos. The
String Cheese Incident is just a
band that you need patience for, I
decided, and resolved to see them
again the next day.
The Saturday String Cheese
show was amazing as a pure spec-
tacle, as a concert and as a socio-
logical experience. Cognizant of
and prepared for the music's slow
build, my expectations were met
and then exceeded as the techni-
cally proficient group serenaded
the crowd with its music - part
country, part rock 'n' roll. More
impressive than the band, though,
were the fans. Not only was this
the first festival experience I had
ever had where everybody could
breath freely in his or her own per-
sonal space, the Cheeseheadswere
unself-conscious and non-judg-

mental. Many were shirtless, many
were wearing tie-dye, and every-
one was doing his or her thing,
dancing in a loose, dorky, swaying
sort of way while smiling and just
being chill. When the band took a
break halfway through, we all sat
down in the big field, and I could
really tell how much of a com-
munity we were. All of us cross-
legged, talking and gazing at the
lit-up stage with anticipation for
the show to resume. It reminded
me of my hometown of Livonia,
where every year on the last Sun-
day in June (the same weekend as
this year's Electric Forest, in fact)
we finish off our annual fair ("The
Spree") by sitting on blankets in
the outfield of a baseball diamond
and watching fireworks.
To my delight, not five min-
utes after the band retook the
stage, fireworks started explod-
ing behind them, while an appar-
ently video-game-themed jam
resulted in a floating model UFO,
stuffed Pac-Man and Pac-Man
ghosts being held on fishing rods
above the crowd, giant inflatable
Mario coin cubes and (I kid you
not) a full-costumed reenactment
of the original "Donkey Kong"
video game on stage while the
band played. Ridiculous? Yes. But
the kind of sensory-overload what-
the-fuck kind of display that no
one will ever forget. The perfect
end to the incredible show came
when Ms. Lauryn Hill joined the
band for a round of universally
beloved covers that ranged from
Stevie Wonder and The Beatles to

Bob Marley, closing with "Could
You Be Loved?"
However, at least half of the fes-
tivalgoers did not attend Cheese's
shows, a fact that I noticed when
I stuck around at the same stage
to see Zedd on Friday and Steve
Angello on Saturday. The crowd
seemed entirely different: younger,
packed-in tighter, wearing base-
ball caps and tank tops. This was
the college crowd that had come
for pulse-pounding EDM, not old-
hippie rock.
Unlike, jam bands, EDM is
actually considered cool. Many
will tell you it's the cutting-edge
of modern music, and it's mostly
unconcerned by extra frills like
guitar riffs or piano solos (or even
vocals). EDM artists know that all
their fans want are catchy hooks to
dance to, and that's exactly what
they give them. Whereas the jam-
mers took acid and smoked pot to
loosen up, these fans took Molly
to totally intensify the experience.
They sweated, pogoed, threw glow
sticks and flipped out in excite-
ment for every new laser beam that
accompanied a drop.'
While Steve Angello was a little
too purely electronic for my per-
sonal taste, Zedd put on the kind of
all-out 110-percent show that pro-
spective festival-headliners dream
of. Mixing into his set repurposed
vocals from pop hits as well/as
his own smashes, Zedd punctu-
ated every bass drop with a flash of
lasers or jets of smoke firing from
the stage, to the glee of the crowd.
It was a 90-minute onslaught of

fun, danceable, energetic electro-
pop beats, and it was just what the
crowd wanted.
Electric Forest catered to
both subcultures by scheduling
its artists against each other. At
all times, one of the main stag-
es would have a more modern,
younger artist, while the other
main stage would feature an older
act (for example, ScHoolboy Q
and Damian Marley played at the
same time). Thanks to this setup,
the EDM-loving, Molly-taking
fratstars and the jam band hippie
stoners could ignore each other,
with each group enjoying its own
music with its own people. How-
ever, these two groups had one
big thing in common. When you
really got down to it, neither was
really there for the artists. EDM,
with the exception of Skrillex and
maybe a few others, has eschewed
the typical instantly-recogniz-
able rock-star status that usu-
ally comes with musical fame (it's
why Daft Punk insists on wearing
those helmets). Would you really
recognize Calvin Harris or Steve
Aoki if you saw them on the street?
No. As talented as they are, in the
end, they're just mediums to deliv-
er the hooks and effects that fans
want. On Saturday night, I noticed
that The String Cheese Incident
was the exact same way. The fans
didn't truly care who was up on
that stage. They were just there
for the music and for each other,
dancing and sweating and trip-
ping and rolling and smiling and
instinctively just having fun.
