During 
a 
break 
in 
the 

Lecturers’ 
Employee 

Organization’s 
first 
open 

bargaining session in Ann 
Arbor 
Friday, 
about 
150 

lecturers and allies – including 
students and tenure -track 
faculty – marched from the 
Diag to Palmer Commons. 
The marchers chanted and 
waved signs, demanding salary 
increases and enhanced job 
security for lecturers, two 
key aspects of the union’s 
bargaining platform to replace 
its 
current 
contract 
that 

expires April 20.

LEO President Ian Robinson, 

a sociology lecturer, said the 
high turnout provides leverage 
at the bargaining table.

“Really, to make a lot of 

major changes in anything you 
have to have a lot of people who 
are willing to be involved,” he 
said. “It shows our members 
just how many students are 
supporting them, from alumni 
here to elected officials. That’s 
really good for the morale of 
our folks.”

LEO, 
which 
represents 

nearly 1,500 non-tenure track 
faculty members across the 
University’s three campuses, 
has 
been 
in 
negotiations 

with 
the 
University 
since 

October. During the morning 
bargaining 
session 
Friday, 

Dearborn 
organizer 
Alex 

Elkins, an Afroamerican and 

African Studies lecturer, said 
the 
University’s 
bargaining 

team offered a “pretty big 
concession” on benefits for 
lecturers who are not employed 
full time.

“Today actually we saw some 

progress because they agreed 
to extend benefits eligibility to 
people who are less than half 
time if their total appointment 
for fall and winter equals 
above 50 percent,” Elkins said. 
“That was pretty big because 

a few months ago they told us 
they would never extend that 
to any employee group at the 
University.”

Salary has been a critical 

issue for lecturers. Right now, 
the minimum salary for a full-
time lecturer is $34,500 in Ann 
Arbor, $28,300 in Dearborn 
and $27,300 in Flint. LEO’s 
proposal would have raised the 
minimum to $60,000 in Ann 
Arbor and $56,000 in Dearborn 
and Flint in 2018, with $2,000 

increases at all three campuses 
in 2019 and again in 2020.

In February, the University 

offered a $1,000 increase to the 
starting salary in 2019, $750 
in 2020 and $500 in 2021. The 
deal also included a 1.5 percent 
annual raise for lecturers in 
Ann Arbor, but not those in 
Dearborn or Flint.

A racist Snapchat sent by 

University of Michigan student 
Lauren Fokken, an LSA sophomore, 
went viral early Friday morning. 
In the picture shared on Twitter, 
GroupMe chats and Facebook, 
Fokken is with another student 
wearing a blackface mask with the 
caption #BlackLivesMatter.

Fokken is employed through 

both 
University 
Housing 
and 

Dining, and works as a student 
manager at Victors cafe in Mosher-
Jordan Residence Hall. She did not 
respond to requests for comment at 
the time of publication.

LSA senior Jordan Jackson, 

a Black student, also works as a 
student coordinator at Victors. She 
saw the Snapchat stay up for more 
than a few hours — though she also 
said Fokken blocked many students 
of color from seeing the image. To 
Jackson, the post was an affront 
to not just the students of color 
Fokken oversees at work, but the 
University’s Black community at 
large.

Michigan advances to Sweet Sixteen with 64-63 win

The Michigan men’s basketball team tackles freshman guard Jordan Poole after his game-winning, last second shot against Houston sent the Wolverines to the Sweet Sixteen.

Jordan Poole’s last-second shot saves Wolverines from elimination in tightly-contested game against Houston

`Somehow, some way.
His legs flailing each and every 

direction and a defender square 
in his face, Jordan Poole caught 
a pass on the right wing from 
Muhammad-Ali Abdur-Rahkman 
and hoisted a prayer.

And as the ball found sweet 

nylon, the prayer was granted — 

somehow, some way — in the wee 
hours of Sunday morning. The 
freshman guard darted to the 
opposite side of the court, greeted 
by the rest of his jubialant team 
as they celebrated an astonishing 
64-63 win.

It was a miracle on the Great 

Plains the likes of which will live 
in Michigan lore right alongside 
the Trey Burke shot and the 
Denard Robinson pass at Under 
the Lights I.

“I was thirsty,” Poole told 

a swath of reporters after the 
game. “Definitely 
thirsty. 
Because 

I’ve been hitting 
shots like that in 
practice all year. 
I just felt like I 
always wanted to 
be in a situation 
like that at the end 
in the game, and my teammates 
constantly tell me that I’ve got ice 

in my veins.

“I definitely dreamed about 

this a long time. 
Actually, before I 
went out there on 
there, I thought, 
‘What if I hit this 
shot right now as 
a freshman?’ ”

And that he 

did. 
On 
this 

stage. With these implications. 
Somehow, some way, the only 

player with the personality to 
match the grand moment found 
the ball with 0.8 seconds and a 
season teetering in the balance.

Now Michigan will head to Los 

Angeles next weekend to play its 
fourth Sweet Sixteen game in six 
years on the back of a monstrous 
defense and one lucky St. Patrick’s 
Day heave.

“I don’t have any words for 

that one,” said fifth-year senior 
Duncan Robinson. “It’s incredible. 

That’s all I got.”

Somehow, some way.
For much of the game, though, 

there appeared to be no way.

For the second consecutive 

game, Michigan’s offense fell 
victim to offensive lulls that 
threatened 
its 
survival 
in 

the NCAA Tournament. The 
Wolverines went to the first TV 
timeout once again without a 
made field goal, this time trailing

Ann 
Arbor 
City 

Councilmember 
Jack 
Eaton, 

D-Ward 4, is challenging Mayor 
Christopher Taylor, D, for his seat 
in the 2018 Democratic primary 
election, Eaton announced via 
press release Thursday.

The retired labor lawyer won 

his current seat on City Council in 
2013, defeating then-incumbent 
Marcia Higgins in the Democratic 
primary. After winning reelection 
in 2017, Eaton’s current term 
would end in 2020.

In the press release, Eaton 

criticized Taylor’s plan to fix 
roads in the city, which has a goal 
of achieving 80 percent of roads 
in “good or better condition” by 
2026.

“Christopher Taylor supports 

a road repair plan that forces 
residents to wait eight years for 
better roads. That’s not a plan; 
it’s a can kicked down a potholed 
road,” he said. “Taxpayers can’t 
afford that kind of leadership any 
longer.”

ON THE DAILY: MATCH MADNESS

BASKETBALL
From Page 1A

 University of Michigan stu-
dents had a lot to celebrate over 
the past weekend, but for Medi-
cal School students, St. Patrick’s 
Day festivities and the Michigan 
Men’s Basketball team’s stun-
ning win against Houston were 
just icing on the cake after they 
learned where they would be 
completing their residencies 
in the annual Match Day event 
Friday.
 On this year’s Match Day, 
162 Medical School students 
found out where they would be 
continuing their training along 
with students from other medi-
cal schools nationwide. At the 
University’s Match Day event, 
graduating students were sur-

rounded by friends, family and 
peers as they tore open enve-
lopes containing the letters that 
foretold their futures.
 According to a Crain’s Detroit 
article, the National Resident 
Matching Program, which facili-
tates matches between senior 
Medical School students and 
residency programs, projected 
there would be 43,000 appli-
cants vying for 33,000 available 
residency spots in 2018. The 
University graduated a particu-
larly strong class with 99.4 per-
cent of graduates being matched 
with a residency program 
despite growing competition for 
these spots.
 In addition, out of these 162 

graduating seniors, about one-
third applied and matched with 
programs in highly competi-
tive specialties. Twenty-eight 
students are graduating with 
both a medical degree and an 
additional advanced degree from 
either the University or another 
equally challenging graduate 
program.
 Rajesh Mangrulkar, the as-
sociate dean for medical student 
education, said the University 
encourages students and pro-
vides them with the resources 
to strive for their top-choice 
residency programs. Mangrulkar 
called Match Day exciting not 
only for students, but also for 
faculty who get the chance to 

see their students succeed.
 “Every year, our students 
strive to reach their goals in the 
match, and every year this day 
is such an important moment,” 
Mangrulkar told Michigan 
Medicine. “Match Day gives us a 
chance to celebrate their aspira-
tions as we prepare to send them 
off to the next phase of their 
career.”
 University students will finish 
their medical school careers 
with graduation on May 11, 
after which they will be sent off 
across the nation to start their 
residencies.

-RACHEL LEUNG

6-1, having missed their first 
seven shots including six 
threes.

Robinson broke the seal 

nearly six minutes in, nailing 
a deep three with a hand in 
his face. He did it again on 
the next possession, pumping 
up his bench on the gallop 
back down the court.

That was the tone all night, 

on both sides — a tough, 
physical street fight. It’s a 
style Michigan has come to 
relish this season.

For all the talk about 

Cougars 
guard 
Rob 
Gray 

offensively 
— 
coming 
off 

a 
39-point 
performance 

against San Diego State — it 
was the defense on both ends 
that controlled the game.

Gray, 
the 
alpha 
and 

omega of Houston’s offense, 
couldn’t find his rhythm in 
the first half, thanks to a 
swarming defensive effort 
from 
Michigan 
guards 

Zavier Simpson and Abdur-
Rahkman. Gray finished with 
23, but on 8-of-22 shooting.

“We just tried to limit his 

threes, make him score tough 
twos,” Abdur-Rahkman said. 
“He made a lot of them, but 
that’s all you can really do, is 

try to force him into contested 
shots.”

On the flip side, a physical 

Houston man defense held 
the 
Wolverines 
in 
check, 

stifling Michigan’s pick-and-
roll action with athleticism, 
holding it so just 30 percent 
from the field. By the end 
of 
the 
game, 
a 
dejected 

Wolverines 
bench 
thought 

that would be the culprit of its 
dying season.

“They were down because 

we did some things that aren’t 
winning basketball today — 
just a few, but just enough,” 
said Michigan coach John 
Beilein. “But credit Houston. 
They made us make some of 
those plays.”

At half, the game was tied at 

28, those struggles leaving 
the game back where it 
started, just with a few more 
bumps and bruises.

And while the bumps and 

bruises didn’t subside, the 
lid on the buckets slowly did.

Then, it was game on.
With 
17 
lead 
changes 

and 12 ties in total, neither 
team took firm control until 
Gray began to come to life 
midway through the half. He 

scored eight of his team’s 10 
points at one point, nabbing 
a six point lead with 10:43 
left on an inexplicably wide-
open three.

But the see-saw swung 

right back. Michigan fought 
through recurring offensive 
demons, 
finishing 
the 

game with just 36 percent 
shooting. 

And it has more than just 

one fortuitous bounce to 
thank for the escape.

Down 

51-46 
with 

just over five 
minutes 
left, 

Matthews shot 
a 
3-pointer 

off the back 
of the rim. It 
careened high 
into 
the 
air 

and 
through 

the hoop just 
as a Houston 
forward 
was 

whistled 
for 

a foul. Teske 
made 
both 
free 
throws, 

and suddenly a 51-46 game 
became 51-51 in only a single 
possession.

The teams traded blows 

from 
there, 
with 
the 

Cougars 
grabbing 
what 

seemed to be the final lead 
with 44 seconds left on two 

free-throws from forward 
Devin Davis.

But that wasn’t the last 

of Michigan’s season. It 
just couldn’t be. There was 
a little more than a strong 
breeze 
flowing 
through 

Intrust 
Bank 
Arena 
on 

Saturday night. Sophomore 
center Jon Teske could just 
feel it.

“I 
actually 
told 
CJ 

(Baird), I didn’t think we 
were gonna go home,” Teske 
said. 
“I 
felt 
something 

special 
was 
going 
to 

happen and I’m just glad 
he knocked that down. … 
It’s something I will always 
remember.”

And 
in 
a 
wild 
back 

and 
forth 
affair, 
it 
all 

came down to a howling 
freshman, 
with 
the 

confidence to belt “Ham” 
— the team’s nickname for 
Abdur-Rahkman 
— 
with 

the season on the line. The 
call was “Tennessee,” the 
same 
full-court 
inbound 

play run to beat Maryland 
early in the season as time 
expired. The senior caught 
the pass at midcourt and 
then put his season and 
career in the hands of 
Poole, who answered the 
faith with one of the most 
historic shots in program 
history.

“I knew they were not 

going to let 
me 
shoot 

the 
ball. 

So 
I 
was 

looking for 
JP,” Abdur-
Rahkman 
said. 
“I 

knew 
he 

could 
knock 
it 

down.

“Literally, he makes it all 

the time in practice.”

And as the entire team 

piled on Poole under the 
hoop, 
cheers 
reigned 

down from the traveling 
Michigan crowd and band.

“It’s 
great 
to 
be 
a 

Michigan Wolverine.”

For all the talk about Cougars 
guard Rob Gray offensively, it 

was the defense on both ends that 

controlled the game. 

“I actually told 

CJ, I didn’t think 

we were gonna 

go home.”


As the years have gone by, I 

have come to realize that “Sex 
and the City” is a lot like a cool 
aunt. For the sake of the analogy, 
imagine this aunt is white. As a 
child, you thought this aunt was 
glamorous, witty and exciting, 
but as you’ve matured, the façade 
crumbled. In reality, this aunt 
is not as smart as she thinks she 
is, she disguises prejudice as 
humor, and fetishizes Black men 
uncomfortably too much to be as 
colorblind as she claims.

I sighed with relief upon 

realizing “Sex and the City” 
turns 20 this year, because with 
two decades under its belt, the 
show, 
like 
the 
hypothetical 

aunt, is eligible to be deemed 
“of a different time.” It’s easy to 
write off “Sex and the City” as a 
problematic fav, a guilty pleasure, 
something not to be taken too 
seriously. After all, there is no 
clear malice in the show’s tone-
deafness. It’s just that — tone-
deaf. Ignorant. Despite this truth, 
it is undeniable “Sex and the City” 
had a hand in promoting the 
symbolic annihilation of women 
of color on screen. And as much 
as I would love to stop writing 
this article, sit down and watch a 
marathon of Season 2 (the show 
at its finest), I can’t. There needs 
to be an open discussion about 
the role “Sex and the City” and 
others have in indoctrinating 
women of color into the culture 
that heralds white women as 
beautiful, central and worthy 
of love while women of color, 
in contrast, are discarded to 
the margins without a second 
thought.

I grew up on “Sex and the 

City”. I’ve seen every episode, 
can identify seasons by Carrie’s 
hairstyle and for a while listed 
Carrie Bradshaw as my role 
model and sole aspiration for 
adulthood. To me, “Sex and 
the City” was infallible … until 
I re-watched an episode that 
threw my entire perception of 
the show into question. It’s called 
“No Ifs, Ands, or Butts”, and the 

B-plot centers around Samantha 
partaking in the “revolutionary” 
act of dating a Black man, Chivon.

Conflict quickly arises when 

Chivon’s sister, Adeena, tells 
Samantha she doesn’t want her 
brother dating a white woman. 
No deeper explanation is given 
as to why Adeena thinks this 
way, making her appear to be an 
irrationally prejudiced, cracker 
hater. Mild disapproval from 
Adeena eventually erupts into 
a fully-fledged altercation at 
a nightclub between her and 
Samantha.

While watching, I paused. Not 

only did I find myself mentally 
cheering for Adeena, but for the 
first time in all of my viewings 
of this episode, I felt a bizarre 
sense of connection to her that 
typically does not apply for one-
episode characters.

I now assume that my long-

standing 
ignorance 
of 
this 

episode’s (and in a larger context, 
the show’s) problematic nature 
was a result of its striking 
parallel to my everyday life. 
From second to eighth grade, I 
was one of two Black students 
(the only Black female) in a class 
of 60. The oversaturation of 
whiteness emanating from my 
television screen felt normal — 
I felt as though I was the thing 
that needed to be adjusted. This 
habit of adjusting myself was 
taken to the next level when I 
indoctrinated my middle school 
friends into the fandom. We all 
attempted to covertly alter our 
personalities to better match 
the women’s of “Sex in the 
City”. I was almost completely 
successful in my inhabitation of 
the role — the only thing missing 
was a love interest. To say the 
least, my friends did not have this 
affliction. I began to wonder why 
I was never asked to slow dance 
awkwardly to “Drops of Jupiter” 
at the winter dance. Why did 
all of my friends get special 
Valentine’s Day gifts while I 
was left with nothing but Fun-
Dip stained fingers and a shitty 
attitude for the remainder of 
the day? The same exclusionary 
feeling I’d get momentarily while 
watching “Sex and the City” had 

begun to creep into my everyday 
life.

When you watch television, 

by definition, you are a detached 
spectator of the action. But, 
a part of you is supposed to 
relate to the characters and the 
situations. Without a doubt, I 
related to (as much as a middle 
schooler 
could) 
the 
central 

characters of “Sex and the City”, 
but I always knew I did not look 
like them. Characters that looked 
like me were either invisible or 
two-dimensional, 
stupid 
and 

buffoonish. For a while, my 
coping mechanism was to assert 
it was “just TV,” and it couldn’t be 
completely accurate in relation to 
my life. This resilience began to 
cave when the same scenarios 
that I had written off as “fake” 
started to occur for my friends — 
just not me. In addition, I began 
to question, with every new show 
I started, why did I always have 
to strain to picture myself in 
these everyday situations? Why 
can’t someone look like me and 
share my personality traits?

I began to see the world as 

solely white. I saw courtship, 
love, sex and dating through a 
solely white and heteronormative 
lens. I’d realize in my later teen 
years that by seeing only white 
people depicted as glamorous, 
complex, dynamic and witty, 
I and clearly others began to 
conflate 
those 
characteristics 

with the skin color with which 
they 
were 
most 
regularly 

associated. Spoiler: it wasn’t my 
own. Being white meant being 
the default, being regular. Being 
Black or another race meant you 
were there to serve a purpose. I 
could not simply be. Everyone 
wants to believe they are smart, 
charming and worthy of love. I 
thought I was these things. The 
television disagreed with me. I 
fell victim to one of American 
society’s greatest traps: Rather 
than 
vilifying 
the 
horrible 

depictions, I began to vilify my 
own Blackness and the over-
pronounced 
“Blackness” 
of 

characters onscreen.

As a Muslim in the United 

States, it wasn’t unusual for 
me to feel like I didn’t belong 
here. As if I was taking up space 
that wasn’t mine to occupy. 
I’ve spent too much of my life 
trying to convince people that 
I’m American enough, while at 
the same time almost doubting 
it myself. As a South Asian 
Muslim, I didn’t expect to see 
myself in any of the exhibits 
at the National Museum of 
African American History and 
Culture, and yet, as I walked 
through rows of artifacts, one, 
in particular, caught my eye. It 
looked like Arabic calligraphy. 
I took a step closer and realized 
that it was a verse from the 
Quran. In fact, it was one that 
I had learned as a small child 
and I said it out loud to myself 
as I read the description — a 
slave had written this Surah and 
their 
Arabic-illiterate 
owner 

thought it was a sign they had 
successfully converted the slave 
out of Islam. This was one of 
many moments at the museum 
where I was suddenly overcome 
with emotion — as I blinked 
rapidly and tried to focus, I 
thought about what it must be 
like to be forced to stop engaging 
with one’s faith.

Though 
my 
own 

circumstances 
are 
vastly 

different, and the ways in 
which my family suppresses 
our engagement with Islam are 
drastically less, in that brief 
moment I felt extremely touched 
by the story behind this artifact. 
My 
family 
avoids 
running 

errands before or after attending 
Masjid 
because 
we 
never 

know if someone will refuse us 
service because we’re dressed 
differently. My dad introduces 

himself 
by 
a 
stereotypical 

European name at work because 
his real name, Husain, combined 
with his long, dark beard remind 
people too much of terrorism. 
I don’t like telling new people 
I’m Muslim — the inevitable 
questions about “my thoughts” 
on the latest act of terrorism 
are too exhausting to keep 
answering. Visiting the National 
Museum of African American 
History and Culture reminded 
me that the problem wasn’t me 
— my feelings of not belonging 
in the United States stemmed 
from other people’s perception 
of me and my identities, not my 
identities themselves.

To clarify, I have not been 

enslaved, 
forced 
to 
convert 

from my religion or experienced 
oppression at the scale that 
the slave who wrote the Surah 
had, and yet, I reacted to this 
particular 
artifact 
in 
such 

an unexpected way. It was a 
reminder that the South Asian 
Muslim 
community 
can 
do 

better. We cannot simply value 
Black 
Americans 
for 
their 

contributions to sports and the 
entertainment industry; we must 
also recognize the contributions 
that Black people have made 
to advance society, including 
fighting for the rights of other 
minority groups in the United 
States. Despite a history of anti-
Blackness within the South 
Asian community, the Black 
community has always stood 
in solidarity with us. We must 
recognize the ways in which 
we benefit from the civil rights 
work the Black community has 
done — all of our oppression is 
tied together and standing up for 
Black Muslims is also standing 
up for ourselves. As Fannie Lou 
Hamer said, “... nobody’s free 
until everybody’s free.” We 
cannot be free if we continue to 
exclude our Black siblings from 

practicing our faith together.

The experiences of Muslims 

in America were unpleasant (to 
say the least) from the very start. 
In the past, we can safely assume 
this oppression stemmed from 
colonizers — the people who 
enslaved other human beings 
and treated them like property. 
However, in the present day, 
we must acknowledge that the 
oppression of Black Muslims 
also comes from other Muslims. 
To my fellow South Asians, I 
implore you to think critically 
about whether we are truly 
making 
Black 
Muslims 
feel 

welcome in our Masjids, our 
communities and our lives. The 
Muslim diaspora in the United 
States has continuously erased 
the voices of Black Muslims in 
our community. I’ve seen fellow 
South Asian Muslims supporting 
various movements across the 
world, and yet, when it comes to 
supporting Black Muslims, the 
silence is deafening.

The Muslim community as 

a whole has a lot of work to do 
to make sure all Muslims feel 
included, including our Black 
siblings. We must realize that 
though it seems the South 
Asian and Black communities 
are distinct, there are many 
ways in which we are also 
connected. The artifact from 
the museum is proof that some 
of these connections go back to 
long before the founding of this 
country. The overlap between 
the Black and South Asian 
communities 
are 
numerous, 

and exhibits like the one at the 
National Museum of African 
American History and Culture 
are 
important 
not 
only 
to 

showcase the history of Black 
Americans, but to remind non-
Black Americans that the link 
between our communities is 
built into our country’s history.

Asian/Pacific 
Islander 

American 
Heritage 
Month 

celebrations have begun, and 
while I am actively taking part 
in celebrating A/PIA history, I 
have also taken time to reflect on 
my engagement with the A/PIA 
community on campus.

A/PIAs are often subject 

to narratives that paint us as 
a monolith — a homogeneous 
group 
of 
people 
from 
an 

arbitrarily 
drawn 
region 
of 

the world. These narratives 
constrain what we and those 
outside of our circles perceive as 
A/PIA, and they are — as I have 
increasingly come to realize — 
violently perpetuated not only 
by the forces of white supremacy 
but by our own communities.

The notion that all A/PIAs 

come from similar classes and 
cultural 
backgrounds 
paints 

all A/PIAs as holding equal 
privilege, entirely ignoring the 
ethnic hierarchies that exist not 
only in Asia, but in our Asian/
Pacific Islander communities 
in the diaspora. The forces of 
exclusion 
and 
elitism 
these 

dynamics create, however, go 
largely unacknowledged.

This 
is 
despite 
the 
fact 

acceptance in self-proclaimed 
A/PIA spaces on campus often 
necessitates assimilation into an 
upper-class, mono-racial/ethnic 
and East-Asian consciousness.

I have often felt the need to 

qualify my presence in these 
spaces 
with 
explanations 

regarding my bi-ethnicity or 
assertions that I am, in fact, 
just as entitled to the label of 
“A/PIA” as everyone else in the 
room.

It has been a lifetime of these 

qualifications that leads me to 
this; it is so crucial that we are 
able to confront the fact the 
monolith is not only an idea that 
is arbitrarily imposed on us, but 
also a rhetoric that defines who 
is recognized as a valid member 
of this community. I feel this 
every time I walk into an A/
PIA space where there is no 
one of my skin color, my openly 
bi-ethnic identity or my cultural 
background. I feel it every time 
we preach “unity” but fail to 
vocalize the ways in which 
intra-Asian/Pacific 
Islander 

imperialism has created tension 
between us. I feel it every 
time the notion of a unified, 
invincible A/PIA identity masks 
the realities of exclusion in our 
community.

Thus, 
“A/PIA 
Heritage 

Month: 
Combating 
the 

Monolith” begins today. This 
spotlight series will highlight A/
PIAs who may not necessarily 
fall into the notion of what an 
A/PIA is or should be. Though 
this series will not paint a 
comprehensive picture of all A/
PIA narratives, I hope that this 
month we can begin scratching 
the surface of a community that 
harbors an immense diversity in 
culture and experience.

My reflection is not indicative 

of the thoughts, feelings or 
convictions 
of 
those 
who 

will come after me. They are 
simply my own. In this vein, 
the stories you will hear over 
the course of this month are 
not ones that should be viewed 
as 
representative 
of 
their 

respective 
identities. 
Rather, 

they are individual narratives 
that 
have 
developed 
and 

emerged from experiences just 
as vivid, intimate and whole as 
yours.

With that, I wish you all a 

happy A/PIA Heritage Month! 
Let us engage in the celebration 
of the rich cultures and identities 
that make up our community, 
and let us strive toward an ideal 
of unity that recognizes and 
celebrates our difference.

The University of Pittsburgh. 

The 
University 
of 
New 

Hampshire. 
Oklahoma 
State 

University. 
Kansas 
State 

University.

And 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan.

Predominantly 
white 

institutions all over the country 
have repeatedly failed to fulfil 
their due diligence and protect 
their students of color from anti-
Blackness and racist acts that 
occur on their campus.

And 
just 
this 
weekend, 

a 
picture 
of 
a 
white 
girl 

named 
Lauren 
Fokken 
and 

her 
non-Black-person-of-

color-yet-complicit 
friend 
in 

blackface 
with 
the 
caption 

“#blacklivesmatter.”

This is not a joke.
Your picture, Lauren Fokken, 

is exactly why we need a Black 
Lives Matter movement.

You believe your pompous, 

degrading picture was funny.

You think that you can put on 

a black-colored face mask and 
undercut an organization and 
movement that has organized 
to 
expose 
and 
eventually 

ameliorate the unfair treatment 
of Black people by police. This 
organization 
recognizes 
the 

incarceration of Black folks 
at astronomically high levels 
compared 
to 
their 
white 

counterparts. This organization 
is 
expansive 
and 
affirms 

the lives of Black queer and 
transgender 
folks, 
disabled 

folks, 
undocumented 
folks, 

folks with records, women and 

all Black lives along the gender 
spectrum. Black Lives Matter 
works to center the narratives of 
those who have been repeatedly 
marginalized 
within 
Black 

liberation 
movements. 
Black 

Lives Matter repeatedly affirms 
the humanity, contributions to 
society and resilience of Black 
people in the face of deadly 
oppression.

And 
so, 
Lauren 
Fokken, 

and 
mysterious 
non-Black 

oppressive person: Making a 
mockery of Black people’s fight 
for survival in an increasingly 
racist and white supremacist 
nation is not funny.

It’s racist.
Now we could brainstorm a 

few solutions to this problem: 
Stop the watering down of the 
race and ethnicity requirement 
so that you can take almost any 
class and have it count for race 
and ethnicity. Put cameras in 
residence halls so that ignorant 
little white kids don’t keep 
writing “N*****” on the back of 
Black kids’ doors.

These are proactive steps in 

the right direction.

But truly, a complete change 

of the University campus culture 
needs to take place. 

This 
campus 
needs 
to 

start 
encouraging 
cultural 

competency at every corner and 
classroom.

Maybe if Becky had paid a bit 

more attention in that watered-
down race and ethnicity class 
she took, she wouldn’t have 
harmed an entire community 
and perpetuated racist minstrel-
like ideology and golliwog vibes.

But in the meantime, Lauren 

and your non-Black POC friend:

Stop using Black people as 

the butt of your jokes. The 
minstrelsy, 
tokenization 
and 

caricatures must stop.

I do, however, want to note 

how ironic this picture is.

Here, 
a 
white-presenting 

woman and an Asian-presenting 
man are trying to make their 
skin smoother and happen to 
make a reference to Black people 
in the process.

In the words of abolitionist 

John Swett Rock:

“If old mother nature had held 

out as well as she commenced, 
we should, probably, have had 
fewer varieties in the races. 
When I contrast the fine tough 
muscular system, the beautiful, 
rich color, the full broad features, 
and the gracefully frizzled hair 
of the negro, with the delicate 
physical 
organization, 
wan 

color, sharp features and lank 
hair of Caucasian, I am inclined 
to believe that when the white 
man 
was 
created, 
nature 

was 
pretty 
well 
exhausted 

— but determined to keep up 
appearances, she pinched up his 
features, and did the best she 
could under the circumstances.”

Keep doing your face masks, 

boo.

What’s next? Time for Michigan to lead on climate change

TYLER FITCH | OP-ED

MomentUM’s 
platform 

shows 
a 
distinct 
and 

comprehensive 
commitment 

to change through policy. 
Divided into the subgroups 
of health, academic affairs, 
student life and government 
relations, the party’s platform 
has 
proposed 
effective 

changes in some of the most-
pressing 
issues 
including 

sexual 
assault 
prevention, 

mental 
health, 
educational 

affordability, food insecurity, 
student organization funding 
and 
campus 
sustainability. 

MomentUM’s specific policy 
points include both improving 
already existing policies to 
developing completely new 
ones.

Their extensive platform, 

while potentially daunting, 
seems 
more 
feasible 
in 

context of the work Ashman 
and Bingham have done in 
CSG before their campaign. 
Ashman has already taken 
many 
steps 
to 
improve 

textbook 
affordability 
and 

housing prices through his 
positions as vice president 
chief of staff and senior policy 
adviser. Bingham, through his 
role as LSA representative, 
worked 
on 
a 
resolution 

supporting the efforts of La 
Casa, a student organization 
advocating for Latinx students 
on campus. Most importantly, 
however, both Ashman and 
Bingham 
demonstrate 
an 

infectious passion for Central 
Student Government and for 
the University; a passion we 
hope will fuel concrete action.

However, 
while 
we 

commend their platform, we 
are also wary of how certain 
proposals will actually work 
to 
deconstruct 
problems 

on 
campus. 
Specifically, 

the party hopes to expand 
funding 
for 
the 
Sexual 

Assault 
Prevention 
and 

Awareness Center and work 
with 
Community 
Matters 

to develop more engaging 
sexual 
assault 
prevention 

programming. While this is 
a concrete policy proposal, 
we are concerned simply 
expanding funding for SAPAC 
won’t solve the complex and 
urgent issue of sexual assault. 
While additional funding and 
education have been used in 
the past to combat the problem 
of sexual assault on campus, 
we hope to see the party take 
these initiatives further by 
committing 
to 
tackle 
the 

roots of the campus sexual 
assault epidemic.

When it comes to student 

affordability, 
MomentUM 

has honed in on specific 
costs 
students 
face, 
such 

as textbooks and housing. 
They’ve created an Emergency 
Education Fund to aid students 
in purchasing supplies during 
financial 
hardships 
and 

proposed initiatives such as 
expanding the Comprehensive 
Studies Program’s laptop loan 
program. 
Additionally, 
to 

ease 
students’ 
accessibility 

to 
applying 
to 
graduate 

school, 
MomentUM 
hopes 

to help fund study aides and 
test 
fees 
for 
professional 

school 
entrance 
exams. 

Such initiatives demonstrate 
a 
keen 
understanding 
of 

the issues that make the 
commmon 
Michigan 

experience unaffordable for 
many students. MomentUM 
also plans to expand the 
number 
of 
Leadership 

Engagement 
Scholarship 

recipients and continues to 
push for compensation for 
CSG 
members. 
While 
we 

have disagreed with Ashman 
on 
whether 
compensation 

should apply solely to CSG, 
we are confident MomentUM 
is well intentioned as they 
seek to tackle the barriers to 

affordability.

We 
 
also 
appreciate 

MomentUM’s 
focus 
on 

demographics that are often 
overlooked in CSG elections, 
such as graduate students 
and North Campus students. 
MomentUM’s 
initiatives 

improve the experiences of 
graduate students on campus 
by 
expanding 
child 
care 

services for student parents 
and pushed the University to 
commit to opening a branch 
of University Health Services 
on North Campus.

In 
their 
platform, 

MomentUM has also shown 
a dedication to supporting 
minority 
students 
and 

increasing 
diversity 
on 

campus. 
Their 
goals 
to 

implement 
a 
race 
and 

ethnicity 
requirement 
in 

all 
schools 
and 
colleges, 

including 
the 
College 
of 

Engineering, 
as 
well 
as 

growing the Comprehensive 
Studies Program to other 
schools 
are 
formidable 

steps in fostering diversity 
on campus. Further, their 
plan to increase funding for 
minority-serving 
student 

organizations is a concrete 
way to further amplify the 
voices of minority students 
on campus.

As the cost of housing 

in 
Ann 
Arbor 
increases, 

MomentUM 
also 
proposes 

to reinstate the Ann Arbor 
Tenants’ 
Union. 
The 

Tenants’ Union is key to 
negotiating and stabilizing 
housing costs for students. 
Regarding the backlash to 
the 
Campus 
Affordability 

Guide, we commend Ashman 
for recognizing the mistakes 
of the Guide and believe he 
will utilize the lessons and 
feedback to make better, more 
thoughtful initiatives for low-
income students on campus.

While we urge the student 

body to vote for presidential 
and 
vice-presidential 

candidates 
Ashman 
and 

Bingham this week, we also 
implore 
the 
party 
itself 

to follow through on the 
commitments they have made 
during this campaign cycle. 
Though CSG is a body whose 
main goal is to represent and 
support University students, 
their 
recent 
efforts 
have 

fallen short. We see this 
election as an opportunity 
for MomentUM, if elected, 
to make formidable change 
and carry out the policy 
proposals on which they ran. 
This endorsement then is 
not only in support of a vote 
for MomentUM’s executive 
candidates but a call to hold 
the winning party to their 
promises—to see that CSG 
delivers meaningful change 
next year. With the power 
of the executive positions of 
CSG, Ashman and Bingham 
have 
the 
ability 
to 
take 

impactful action on campus, 
and as an Editorial Board, 
we hope they carry out their 
commitment to service and 
justice if elected.

Lastly, we implore you, 

students, regardless of what 
party you support, to vote in 
the election this week. Make 
your voices heard and support 
the 
student 
leaders 
you 

believe can make a difference 
on campus.

R

eading the description 
of 
Victors 
Care, 
a 

concierge 
medicine 

program about to be launched 
by Michigan Medicine, made me 
think of how far our university 
has strayed from the vision of 
perhaps our most renowned 
University 
president, 
James 

Angell. He encapsulated the 
mission of the University of 
Michigan 
as 
providing 
“an 

uncommon education for the 
common man.” Leaving aside 
the exclusion of women, which 
would be corrected in later 
years, 
Angell’s 
statement 
is 

particularly relevant today as 
we strive to promote diversity, 
equity and inclusion in all 
aspects of the University. The 
more than 200 members of the 
medical faculty recognized the 
primacy of this mission in their 
letter raising concern about 
the new program of “concierge 
medical care” when they wrote, 
“Victors Care purports to offer 
‘better’ health care to those with 
enough money to pay a large 
access fee. The University of 

Michigan is a public institution 
and our commitment is to serve 
the public, not a private few.”

The 
new 
program 
also 

brings to mind the controversy 
regarding the incorporation of 
“luxury boxes” in remodeling 
the Michigan Stadium back in 
2006. A letter from 33 faculty 
members, 
including 
former 

University 
President 
James 

Duderstadt, warned of “lavish 
entertainment 
facilities 
for 

a privileged few” and of “the 
growing stratification of our 
society and a sad corruption 
of 
our 
university’s 
defining 

traditions.”

What’s the next plan to 

capture 
revenue 
by 
further 

stratifying 
the 
University 

experience? 
Perhaps 
large 

donations might offer select 
students “concierge education,” 
providing 
increased 
time 

with 
faculty, 
personalized 

mentoring 
and 
a 
separate 

building for classes similar to 
the longer patient visits, 24/7 
access, 
“executive” 
physical 

examinations and an exclusive 

clinic building being promised 
to those enrolling in Victors 
Care.

The preeminence of the 

University is not the result of 
the quality of our education and 
research alone. It reflects the 
fact that as a public university 
we strive to provide education 
and carry out that research in 
a non-discriminatory manner, 
in an attempt to serve society 
as a whole and not just an elite 
group.

Hopefully, the leadership 

of the University or Michigan 
Medicine will reconsider this 
inequitable plan. Rather than 
trying to emulate several other 
academic health centers that 
have taken this discriminatory 
approach, we should distinguish 
ourselves by constantly striving 
to provide excellence in health 
care to all who seek it and not 
especially to a favored few.

J

ust over three months 
ago, 
University 
of 

Michigan 
President 

Mark Schlissel announced his 
signing of the “We Are Still In” 
declaration, 
committing 
the 

University to supporting the 
Paris agreement and joining 
a nationwide group of leaders 
who are acting on climate 
change. To me, Schlissel’s action 
represented the latest of a long 
tradition of leading on the most 
pressing issues of the day, from 
the 1965 Teach-Ins to the first 
Earth Day. Acting on climate 
change is a pure distillation 
of the University’s mission: 
to “challenge the present and 
enrich the future.” 

But facing up to the climate 

challenge entails more than 
signatures. It requires action. 
The University has committed 
itself to reducing its emissions 
by 25 percent by 2025, but 
fulfilling the ambitions of the 
Paris agreement to keep the 
world’s 
average 
temperature 

from warming more than 2 
degrees Celsius means even 
deeper 
commitment. 
The 

world’s leading climate change 
scientists (including University 
faculty) estimate a 2-degree 
world will require an emissions 
reduction of 80 percent by 2050. 
If the University is going to 
seriously consider its role in the 
climate challenge, we should 
trust our faculty and set our 
goals according to the science.

Adjusting our energy and 

transportation systems to meet 
that goal would require nothing 
short of transformational change, 
and it won’t be easy. While the 
costs of solar and wind energy 
have fallen faster than anyone 
predicted, 
the 
investment 

required to clean our energy 
would be steep. Further, we’ve 
known for years that there 
are ways to reduce our carbon 
footprint and save money at the 
same time. At a university where 
public oversight is a daily reality 
and 
operational 
budgets 
are 

public information, we have to 
make sure the investments we’re 
making are cost-effective.

Meeting an ambitious goal 

like 80 percent emission reduction 

necessitates 
an 
innovative, 

comprehensive solution. We’ll 
need to reduce our demand 
for resources where it makes 
sense, invest effectively in clean 
energy and offset our emissions 
otherwise where we can’t reduce 
on our own. Above all, we’ll need 
a coordinating principle to make 
sure our actions are maximizing 
their benefits.

Coordination doesn’t have to 

be complicated. At its simplest, 
working together as a university 
means counting our emissions 
where they happen and giving 
people a reason to reduce the 
emissions 
they 
create. 
This 

way, everybody would know 
exactly when and where they 
generate carbon emissions, and 
the individuals who are closest 
to where energy is used are 
empowered to propose ways to 
reduce it. It’s a bottom-up process 
to meet a collective goal.

And we don’t need to start 

from scratch. Yale University 
launched their Carbon Charge 
Project in 2017, which applies 
the societal cost of a carbon 
fee to carbon emissions around 
campus, then reinvests the 
collected money each year back 
into the campus. The result 
is a campus where each unit 
is incentivized to reduce its 
carbon footprint by finding its 
own low-cost, commonsense 
solutions. A carbon charge like 
Yale’s would result in a campus 
engaged 
in 
more 
intricate, 

innovative and cost-effective 
carbon reductions than we 
could get from a single clean 
energy project or climate action 
program.

Though 
it’s 
simple 
in 

concept, 
adding 
a 
carbon 

accounting process to a campus 
with an $8.4 billion budget and 
40 different operating units on 
its general fund will be complex. 
But we can start small. Yale’s 
carbon charge started with 
only six buildings, with a goal 
to expand across its campus. 
While carbon charges or taxes 
work best when they’re applied 
to many individual factors, 
they also function perfectly 
well at small scales. Trying 
a carbon charge wouldn’t be 
a major investment. Instead, 
it’d be an opportunity to test a 
potentially transformative way 
of fighting climate change right 
here on campus.

A carbon charge is not a 

silver bullet. I agree with the 
advocates, 
economists 
and 

experts who argue that using 
a bottom-up approach puts the 
most pressure on those with 
the least capacity to adapt and 
might exacerbate inequalities 
in 
pollution 
exposure. 
It’s 

important that we keep the 
limitations of this type of 
project in mind. On the other 
hand, a campus-wide carbon 
charge is not likely to have the 
same regressive outcomes as 
a societal carbon tax. And a 
carbon charge on campus might 
be just one of several avenues 
the University decides to take 
in its work as a responsible 
global citizen.

To “challenge the present 

and enrich the future” isn’t just 
President Schlissel’s job. It’s 
reproduced by the actions that 
each of us take on this campus 
every 
day. 
Getting 
climate 

action off the ground has 
historically been the result of 
many people working together 
— just look at the 700 people that 
signed the #MichiganIsStillIn 
letter. Let’s advocate for our 
offices, our departments, our 
schools and our university to 
keep track of our emissions. 
On climate change, let’s be the 
leaders and best.

Frances 
Ellen 
Watkins 

Harper was born in 1825 — 
almost 200 years ago. Reading 
her 
poetry, 
however, 
the 

language remains so timeless 
that it sometimes feels as 
though it is coming to us from 
even further away.

I had never encountered 

Harper until this semester, 
when I was introduced to her 
in one of my English classes. 
An 
African-American 
poet 

and author, Harper was born 
in Baltimore to free parents 
and raised by her aunt and 
uncle, civil rights activist Rev. 
William Watkins. She was 
incredibly prolific, publishing 
her first volume of poetry at the 
age of 20 and going on to write 
several more works of poetry, 
short stories and novels.

Given the fact that she 

produced so much work over 
the course of her lifetime, it is 
hardly surprising that Harper 
touches on a variety of different 
themes, subject matters and 
messages throughout the scope 
of her work. A lot of it deals 
with slavery, which of course 
was widespread at the time 
when Harper was writing. 
The first poem of hers that 
stuck with me was “The Slave 
Mother, A Tale of the Ohio,” 
which is inspired by the story 
of Margaret Garner, who killed 
her child rather than have 
her be returned to slavery 
(a story also reimagined by 
Toni Morrison in “Beloved”). 
Harper’s depictions of scenes 
within the poem (“Winter and 
night were on the earth, / And 
feebly moaned the shivering 
trees, / A sigh of winter 

seemed to run / Through 
every murmur of the breeze”) 
are vivid and chilling when 

presented alongside such dark 
subject matter.

Harper 
has 
many 
more 

poems 
that 
deal 
with 

recounting or retelling the 
tragedies of slavery, such as 
“The Slave Auction,” “Eliza 
Harris” and “Bible Defense 
of Slavery.” One of her great 
strengths lies in her ability 
to make use of other texts 
and to extend her subjects 
into matters of universal and 
spiritual significance. “Eliza 
Harris,” for instance, retells 
a scene from “Uncle Tom’s 
Cabin” in which a character 
runs across a frozen river with 
her child in order to escape 
slavery. In “The Slave Mother,” 
Harper invokes biblical times: 
She recounts how “Judea’s 
refuge cities had power / To 
shelter, shield and save, / 
E’en Rome had altars: ’neath 
whose shade / Might crouch 
the wan and wary slave,” 
and juxtaposes these ancient 
cities with Ohio, which “had 

no sacred fane, / To human 
rights so consecrate.” She visits 
biblical literature many other 
times in her works, in poems 
like “Ruth and Naomi,” “The 
Burial of Moses” and “Rizpah, 
the Daughter of Ai.”

Harper’s work is saturated 

with 
evidence 
of 
her 

multifaceted 
intellectualism, 

from her religious, literary 
and cultural references to her 
old-fashioned 
language 
and 

careful, 
impeccable 
meter. 

One of the things that makes 
her such a fascinating figure 
is that the thoroughness with 
which she involved herself in 
her literature is reflected in 
the life that she lived apart 
from her writing. In addition 
to being a writer, Harper was 
an abolitionist, suffragist and 
political activist. She helped 
slaves on the Underground 
Railroad 
on 
their 
way 
to 

Canada, and was involved in 
several activist groups, such 
as the National Association of 
Colored Women (of which she 
was a founding member), the 
American Anti-Slavery Society 
and the Woman’s Christian 
Temperance Union.

Any artist, or really any 

person at all, could learn 
a great deal from Harper: 
She articulated herself with 
elegance and sophistication, 
and also practiced the ideals 
that 
her 
writing 
espoused 

in her day-to-day life. She 
was everything that makes a 
great poet — which is to say, 
deeply in tune with everything 
around her: the culture and 
the injustices, the past and the 
present and the future.

‘Take Your Pills’ a look 
inside the Adderall craze

Netflix’s 
“Take 
Your 
Pills” 

tackles the dependence on Adderall 
that is growing in every nook and 
cranny of the American population. 
Composed of interviews with high 
schoolers, college students and 
Adderall users in the workplace, 
along with interviews with the 
ones who sit across the counter and 
write the prescriptions, “Take Your 
Pills” creates a sometimes chilling 
— an all-the-time intriguing — 
depiction of how Adderall may be 
changing the concept of modern 
human performance.

By nature of its style of 

documentary, “Take Your Pills” 
shies 
away 
from 
any 
grand 

sweeping 
statements 
about 

the use of Adderall and other 
analogous prescription drugs. The 
documentary 
instead 
provides 

history about the use of the drug 
as well as testimony from medical 
experts, allowing the viewer to 
form their own opinion. The tone 
of the documentary surrounding 
the drug certainly isn’t neutral, but 
it’s not a film made to scare anybody 
straight. “Take Your Pills” focuses 
less on how any one individual 
case of Adderall abuse can affect 
someone’s life and more on what 
had to have happened in the last 

century to get to this point. 

The way the documentary tells 

the history of the drug since the 
1930s is great, producing some of 

the best moments in the film as a 
whole. It provides an interesting 
perspective into the pharmaceutical 
boom of the second half of the 20th 
century, using amphetamine, the 
drug that would become modern 
Adderall, as an example of how 
alarmingly ready American society 
was to adopt a prescription practice 
without a second thought. The 
anecdote of school children being 
fed the drug by their administrators 
to increase docility in particular is 
interesting in its contrast to how the 
situation would be viewed today. 
The idea of children being given 
medication by their teacher without 
first going through a parent would 
be unbelievable in this day and age, 
yet, in the 21st century, the use of 
the drug is only increasing. 

“Take Your Pills” chalks this up 

to what they call the “arms race 
of human capital” — a dressed 
up moniker used to describe the 
pressures placed on kids from a 
young age to do whatever it takes 
to knock out the competition and 

reach their potential, much of the 
artillery in this arms race coming 
in the form of things like a GPA or 
the SAT. All of this falls into one of 
their driving questions toward the 
end of the documentary, essentially 
asking what the world would lose 
if it became completely saturated 
by Adderall use. An interesting 
question — one that it seems the 
filmmakers believe soon might 
have to be answered.

The heterogeneous ensemble 

assembled for “Take Your Pills” 
is a highlight of the feature. The 
documentary never feels like it 
dwells on one aspect of the issue 
for too long, and seems to make it 
a point to give as many differing 
opinions on the subject that it can. 
The film’s fluidity was confusing to 
follow in the first 15 to 20 minutes, 
however once it became clear that 
it was not going to be a tightly 
character-driven 
documentary, 

it made sense. “Take Your Pills” 
benefits from this choice in the end. 
In a lot of ways, the documentary 
feels like something that will 
be shown in ninth grade health 
classrooms in 10 or 15 years, which, 
given the subject at hand, is just 
about as much as one could ask of 
the film. Whether that classroom 
will be filled with 25 13-year-olds 
wired on the super pill, or whether 
the Adderall craze will be a thing of 
the past, only time will tell.

UMMA’s ‘The Comforter’

Crossing through the Diag, 

headed towards the Union, one 
cuts through the embrace of 
Mason Hall and the University’s 
art museum. The museum’s 
decorative, 
almost 
stained 

glass windows create a modern 
aesthetic, catering to a walk 
at any time of day. But as one 
nears the end of the building, 
an ominous feeling overcomes 
our traveler as they come across 
what appears to be an almost 
creepily realistic depiction of 
what might be a young girl. 
Holding a baby? Or maybe a 
chicken?

Without really knowing what 

is going on inside the front glass 
display of the UMMA, the vast 
majority of people in passing are 
confused with this exhibition. 
The composition of this piece 
brings forth a concept discussed 
all too often in the world of art 
and design: the introduction of 
uncomfortable 
depictions 
as 

works of art. The strategy of 
bringing forth uncomfortable 
ideas and visions into the 
world of fine art has a wide 
range of implications, posing 
an interesting experience for 
viewers of these works.

Artist 
Patricia 
Piccinini 

is known for using her art as 
a critique of the ethics that 
lie within certain scientific 

processes 
and 
man-made 

replications. 
As 
one 
looks 

closer at “The Comforter,” the 
piece depicts a young girl with 
excessive hair on her face and 
body. In her arms, she holds 
an 
underdeveloped, 
organic 

creature, unidentifiable from 
afar. This sense of strangeness 
that Piccinini employs in her 
work proves to be intentional, 
speaking to the problems of 
genetically modified scientific 
processes, using the object in 
the arms of the girl to allude to 
this theme.

“Patricia (Piccinini) has said 

that she feels ‘The Comforter’ is 
an incredibly optimistic work,” 
said UMMA curator Kathleen 
Forde.

An unusual statement for 

such a grotesque work, the piece 
has different implications from 
close up and far away. In passing, 
one may see a child holding a 
baby, a perhaps more expected, 
understood concept. But as one 
takes time to zoom in on the 
piece, graphic details become 
apparent, leading viewers to ask 
themselves: “Why is this piece 
on this campus” or “Why does it 
exist in the first place?”

“Viewers 
can 
visit 
the 

exhibition 
in 
the 
museum 

and 
then 
have 
a 
different 

relationship when viewing it 
from outside… or vice versa,” 
Forde said.

This relationship of space 

was created with a specific 

intention.

“My hope is that it peaks the 

curiosity of students passing 
by from the outside, so much 
that they visit the museum for 
another view from the inside,” 
Forde said.

With works that aren’t as 

easy on the eyes and meanings 
that are not always completely 
obvious, 
it 
is 
difficult 
to 

contextualize their place in the 
world of art. Piccinini’s fits into 
this category. Blurring the line 
between art and activism, the 
piece holds a message that goes 
beyond what the eye can see.

Speaking to the importance 

of diversity, Forde notes the 
piece’s place as an artwork and 
a call to action.

“First and foremost empathy, 

compassion for those ‘different’ 
than us — something we could 
stand to have a lot more of in the 
world these days,” she said.

“The 
Comforter” 
serves 

as an example of pushing of 
boundaries. 
In 
a 
distinctly 

uncomfortable 
manner, 
the 

work shows viewers the amount 
of change that has yet to occur 
surrounding topics that involve 
the boundaries between the 
natural 
and 
the 
artificial. 

Piccinini opens a conversation 
about the barriers between 
the 
genetically 
modified 

and the natural, one that is, 
although 
uncomfortable 
and 

often overlooked, all the more 
necessary.

is hard to come by. 

That being said, for what 

it is, it’s not bad. “I Can 

Only Imagine” is more than 
marginally 
entertaining 
for 

those who don’t know who 
Bart Millard is, and it’s easy to 
imagine it being a great night at 
the movies for those people out 
there who can belt every note 
of Millard’s songs. Quaid gives 
his usual performance, elevating 
what otherwise would’ve been a 
one-note character to someone 
who seems to have multiple 

layers — even if these layers 
are never shown explicitly on 
screen. Sadly the same cannot 
be said for fresh-faced Finley, 
who portrays Millard with all 
the depth of a children’s cartoon 
character. Some of it can be 
blamed on the direction, which 
is uninspired but expected in a 
paint-by-number picture such as 
this. Regardless, a crucial aspect 
of any biopic is the performance 
of the lead and in this case, that 
performance simply falls flat. 

“I Can Only Imagine” is 

designed to be appealing to 
people who have fond memories 
and a love of Millard and his 
band’s famous song. But for 
everyone else, the film will 
probably just be a bore. The 
Erwin brothers seem to thrive 
off of these kinds of Christian 
feel-good family films, but for 
general audiences, films of this 
sort are just no longer relevant.

Netflix’s 
new 
trend 
of 

picking 
up 
acclaimed 
TV 

and film from around the 
world has been its source for 
some of the past year’s most 
fresh and engaging content. 
From the gripping German 
historical 
drama 
“Babylon 

Berlin,” 
to 
the 
thrilling 

Spanish heist show “La casa 
de papel,” international TV 
is finally starting to grow in 
prominence in a genre that 
has 
long 
been 
dominated 

by 
American 
studios 
and 

producers. “Tabula Rasa,” a 
Belgian psychological thriller, 
is a worthy addition to this 
collection.

“Tabula 
Rasa”’s 
first 

episode, “Spectre,” previews 
the 
slow-burning 
nature 

of the show. Shots move at 
a languid pace along the 

gray, 
dreary 
environments 

they 
depict, 
including 
the 

psychiatric ward in which a 
young woman named Annemie 
D’Haeze 
(Veerle 
Baetens, 

“News from Planet Mars”) 
finds herself. Suffering from 
short-term amnesia after a car 
accident, she discovers that 
she is the prime witness in the 
disappearance of a man named 
Thomas 
de 
Geest 
(Jeroen 

Perceval, “The Ardennes”).

Unfortunately for her and 

the detectives pursuing the 
case, while flashbacks do show 
that the pair indeed met in a 
seemingly uneventful manner, 
Mie cannot remember a thing 
about de Geest, nor certain 
aspects of her life around the 

time of her accident. Much of 
her time in the ward is piecing 
together details of this time 
period.

The 
viewer 
is 
always 

alongside Mie as she tries to 
remember her past, but is also 
made aware that the narrator is 
inherently unreliable. A doctor 
notes that increased amounts 
of stress make Mie susceptible 
to 
even 
more 
“deletion” 

of memories as her brain 
goes into overdrive trying 
to fill them in. The superb 
cinematography 
delicately 

balances this line, showing 
us 
some 
oddly 
disturbing 

supernatural 
imagery 
— 

such as a mysterious red 
powder seeping through the 
walls — but also occasionally 
reminding us that what we’re 
seeing 
is 
not 
necessarily 

accurate.

Baetens, 
a 
mainstay 
in 

Belgian cinema and TV, acts 
in a subtle, restrained manner

Series Premiere

Stephen Kellogg makes a 
family party for everyone

Stephen Kellogg is a family 

man, no doubt about it. The 
singer-songwriter 
has 
four 

daughters and a wife of 15 
years, but his warm presence 
could make anyone feel a part of 
something bigger, tied together 
by the common thread of folk 
music. 
On 
Friday, 
Kellogg 

brought this sense of unity to 
The Ark, making his stamp on 
the venue with his beautifully 
written songs and engaging 
personality. The connection 
he made with his audience 
that night was uncanny, almost 
as comfortable and open as 
a house party with friends 
and relatives. This is what 
makes Kellogg unique and his 
shows so inviting — he is truly 
committed to making his music 
an intimate experience for his 
audience, one rambling story at 
a time.

Kellogg 
kicked 
off 
the 

intimate concert with a bang, 
the song “4th Street Moon” 
from his time in a band known 
as Stephen Kellogg and the 
Sixers. Though many in the 
audience may have not known 

the song already, it was clear 
from that first chord that the 
night would be memorable. 
Kellogg appears as if he was 
born on stage, taking the 
spotlight and using it to his 
advantage, but never letting 
go of his connection with the 
audience. He let his small 
crowd at The Ark know this 
early, telling them that he “had 
a plan for the night — sing-
alongs, stories and the like,” 
with a laugh. This was most 
certainly true, as Kellogg wove 
in tales of his own life to set up 
each song with a warm smile 
and touching sense of humor.

The singer has a committed 

fan base, who affectionately 
call him “SK,” but there were a 
fair amount of new faces in the 
crowd, drawn to the concert 
from Kellogg’s performance on 
night one of the 41st Ann Arbor 
Folk Festival earlier this year. If 
Kellogg didn’t win those people 
over by the end of the night, I 
don’t know what would have — 
his rapport with the audience 
grew with every tune he sang, 
telling the story of his life and 
loves with songs like “1993” 
(about meeting his wife at the 
age of 16) and “4 Kids,” among 
others. The songwriter also 

invited opener Hailey Steele up 
for two songs, her pure country 
voice accompanying Kellogg’s 
gritty folk drawl for crowd 
favorite “See You Later, See 
You Soon.”

Kellogg joked about how his 

labels have asked him to “stop 
writing songs about specific 
dates and people,” but that is 
clearly the artist’s forte — it 
could easily get old, but he 
manages to make every song 
stand out from the others. He’s 
a true storyteller in every sense 
of the word, taking advantage 
of his life experience to craft 
a unique connection with his 
listeners and fellow musicians. 
Though his songs are often 
specific, it’s this specificity 
that makes them universal — 
he puts into words what we all 
feel about family, love and the 
challenges life always presents. 
Kellogg closed the show on 
this universal note, singing 
hit 
“Thanksgiving” 
with 
a 

raw and soulful twang which 
brought the audience to their 
feet. Kellogg is a family man on 
his own accord, but he turned 
everyone there into a family 
for two hours, singing and 
laughing until he left the stage, 
arms raised in triumph.

‘Tabula Rasa’ is a subtle

TV

that 
perfectly 
encapsulates 

her character’s story. Mie is 
clearly rattled and frightened 
in the psychiatric ward, yet 
stubbornly 
determined 
to 

remember who she truly is. 
She is, however, the only actor 
who stands out, although little 
focus has been placed on any 
of the other characters.

The show truly excels at 

merging 
her 
psychological 

journey 
with 
horror 
and 

supernatural 
elements. 

Despite 
being 
marketed 

primarily as a supernatural/
psychological thriller, à la 
“Memento” or “The OA,” the 
horror elements in “Tabula 
Rasa” are more effective than 
a large majority of horror 
films out there. Sure, some 
scenes rely on common tropes 
(ghastly strings, conversations 
that 
ominously 
foreshadow 

future 
events), 
but 
the 

combination of Baeten’s acting 
and the cinematography is 
executed 
marvelously 
to 

create some truly unnerving 

scenes, exacerbated by the 
uncertainty that Mie and the 
audience face.

“Tabula Rasa” is slow and 

methodical, with the ability to 
draw you in through its dark, 
chilling atmosphere and the 
sheer amount of new questions 
it raises at every turn. None of 
it is wholly original in terms of 
characterization, storyline or 
production, but for fans of any 
kind of dark mystery thrillers, 
its 
meticulous 
execution 

makes it a must-watch.

Reviewing a film like “I 

Can Only Imagine” isn’t really 
a fair thing to do. It is a film 
designed to appeal to such a 
specific subset of the audience 
that, unless you are a part of 
that subset, it’s hard for you 
to properly assess the film on 
its intended merits. Directed 
competently by Andrew and 
Jon Erwin (“Mom’s Night 
Out”), “I Can Only Imagine” 
tells the story of the events that 
inspired the song of the same 
name, which is apparently 
among the most beloved of all 
modern Christian folk songs. 
The 
film 
stars 
newcomer 

J. Michael Finley as Bart 
Millard, whose contentious 
relationship with his father 
inspired the song. The father 
in question is Dennis Quaid 
(“A Dog’s Purpose”), who gives 
the picture an air of legitimacy 
it might otherwise lack.

The story follows a fairly 

basic biopic drama formula, 
beginning 
with 
Bart 
in 

childhood 
and 
following 

him 
into 
adulthood. 
The 

complicated 
relationship 

between Bart and his father 
Arthur, 
while 
interesting 

enough, feels as though it 
isn’t as well developed as it 
might have been were the 
script free to go deeper into 
the psychological issues at 
the root of it. This problem 
extends 
beyond 
just 
this 

storyline; in fact, much of 
the movie feels constrained 
by its religious overtones. 
What actually leads someone 
to become a Christian pop 
star and what that does to 
a person’s worldview isn’t 
particularly well examined 
because it feels as though the 
movie is mostly preaching 
to the choir. No attempts are 
made to say anything that Bart 
Millard himself might not say 
about his own life, and any 
deeper meaning in the movie

Putting a spotlight on women’s sports

In observance of Women’s History 
Month, 
The 

Daily launches 
a series aimed 
at telling the 
stories 
of 

female 
ath-

letes, coaches 
and teams at 
the University 
from the per-
spective of the 
female sports 
writers 
on 

staff. Former managing sports edi-
tor Betelhem Ashame kicks off the 
series with this column.
T

his month is almost 
universally known for 
March Madness, the 

single best sporting event of the 
year.

In the past weekend of the 

NCAA Tournament, there was 
the historic 20-point upset of 
No. 1 overall seed Virginia at the 
hands of No. 16 seed UMBC — 
the only time the lowest seed has 
beaten the top seed in the men’s 
tournament.

There was No. 13 seed Buffalo 

putting together a 20-point win 
of its own over No. 4 seed Ari-
zona to secure the first tourna-
ment victory in program history. 
There was No. 11 seed Loyola-
Chicago advancing to the Sweet 
Sixteen on the back of not one, 
but two game-winning shots 
against No. 6 seed Miami and 
No. 3 seed Tennessee, respec-
tively.

And of course, there was the 

shot that wrote Jordan Poole’s 
name in Michigan lore, as the 
freshman guard — with his legs 
stretched wide apart and a hand 
directly in his face — made an 
improbable, miracle shot to beat 
the buzzer and punch the third-
seeded Wolverines’ ticket to Los 
Angeles for the Sweet Sixteen.

But you already know all that. 

I’d bet my bracket money on it.

There’s probably a lot about 

this weekend you know noth-
ing about, though. For instance, 

there’s more than one NCAA 
Tournament in March.

And this isn’t the first time a 

No. 16 seed topped a No. 1 seed. 
Harvard upset Stanford in the 
women’s tournament 20 years 
ago.

That fact might catch you by 

surprise. It certainly did for me 
when I saw it on Twitter, in rela-
tion to UMBC’s feat. I’m just as 
old as that game, and I had never 
heard of it.

There have been notable 

upsets in this year’s women’s 
tournament, too. You just prob-
ably didn’t know about them.

There was No. 12 seed Florida 

Gulf Coast stunning No. 5 seed 
Missouri with a double-digit 
victory — despite the Tigers’ 
best player dropping 35 points 
— becoming the lowest seed to 
advance to the second round in 

the 64-team field.

There was No. 11 seed Central 

Michigan securing a win over 
No. 6 LSU for the first tourna-
ment victory in program history 
as the first 11-seed to win since 
2015. Mere hours later, there was 
No. 11 seed Buffalo pulling off a 
20-point upset as well by beating 
No. 6 seed South Florida to also 
earn its first tournament victory 
in program history.

And Michigan, which made 

the tournament for the first time 
since 2013, advanced out of the 
first round with a double-digit 
win over Northern Colorado, 
but expectedly couldn’t pull off 
an upset of its own against No. 2 
Baylor in Waco, TX.

Even as a female former man-

aging sports editor of this paper, 
I admittedly didn’t know much 
about the women’s tournament 

this year, either. Besides that 
Michigan part, I had to do some 
searching to find out what I just 
told you.

While the men’s tournament 

has been broadcast all over CBS, 
TNT and TBS, the women’s 
tournament has been relegated 
to ESPN2 — the secondary chan-
nel of the network branded as 
the worldwide leader in sports. 
That isn’t a new phenomenon for 
women’s sports.

Even on the professional 

level, for example, the WNBA 
constantly finds itself stuck on 
ESPN2, while the NBA spreads 
its games between ABC, TNT 
and ESPN. With a lower volume 
of coverage, it isn’t hard to see 
why women’s sports struggle to 
come out from behind the shad-
ows.

There’s more you should know 

about this weekend as a Michi-
gan fan.

The swimming and diving 

team finished in fourth place at 
the NCAA Championships and 
secured a team trophy — earn-
ing 267 points, the third-highest 
total in program history — for 
the first time since 1996. Nine 
swimmers, one diver and four 
relays scored points, includ-
ing three national runner-up 
finishes, to help the Wolverines 
become the first Big Ten team to 
earn a top-five finish since that 
same year.

The gymnastics team cap-

tured its fourth Big Ten regular-
season title in the past six years 
with its 15th win of the season at 
the Big Five Meet. Michigan now 
has an opportunity to claim its 
fifth consecutive Big Ten Cham-
pionship next weekend as well.

The water polo team ran its 

win streak to 15 games with 
three more victories over ranked 
opponents to finish off its non-
conference slate — the sixth time 
in program history the Wolver-
ines have achieved that many 
consecutive victories.

The softball team did one bet-

ter and extended its win streak 
to 16 games with four victories 
by a combined margin of 35-0, 
including an exclamation mark 
courtesy of freshman right-
hander Sarah Schaefer, who 
tossed the first perfect game of 
her Michigan career. 

Those are just five of the 14 

female teams that don the maize 
and blue. I could go on, but I’ll 
stop there. 

A few synopses don’t do jus-

tice to these teams. Their stories 
are just as layered and their 
accomplishments are just as 
important as those of the men’s 
teams that have been in the 
spotlight all this time. They just 
haven’t received the same level 
of attention.

There’s one more thing you 

should know about, if you didn’t 
already. March is also Women’s 
History Month. It’s an oppor-
tune time to put a spotlight on 
these women.

It’s our responsibility to write 

about them. It’s your responsibil-
ity to read about them.

Women’s sports have been 

undervalued in society for a long 
time, even after Title IX. If you 
didn’t already, hopefully now 
you know.

So over the course of the next 

two weeks, in accordance with 
Women’s History Month, my 
fellow female sports writers and 
I will be putting a spotlight on 
their stories.

They deserve to be told. We 

are here to do the telling.

EVAN AARON/Daily

The men’s basketball NCAA Tournament is going on, but there should be more attention paid to women’s sports.

BETELHEM
ASHAME

A familiar miracle

WICHITA, Kan. — You’ve 

seen that play before.

Alright, 
so 
you 
haven’t 

seen 
that 
exact 
scenario, 

with Jordan Poole hitting an 
improbable, contested three 
to send the Michigan men’s 
basketball team to the Sweet 
Sixteen. But you’ve seen that 
set before.

Think 
back 
to 
January, 

when the Wolverines needed 
free 
throws 
from 
senior 

guard 
Muhammad-Ali 

Abdur-Rahkman to overcome 
Maryland.

It’s the same set.
Freshman forward Isaiah 

Livers 
inbounded 
the 
ball 

with a baseball pass to Abdur-
Rahkman, who turned at half 
court and tried to make a play.

Back then, he got into the 

paint and was fouled. This 
time, he was cut off by Houston 
defenders, and he had to dish it 
off to Poole.

And the fate of the entire 

season rested in the hands of 
the 
boisterous, 
inconsistent 

freshman from Milwaukee.

Even before that, it would 

have been hard to console 
Abdur-Rahkman with the hope 
that the play has worked before. 
Moments earlier, he missed a 
layup that would have tied the 
game with six seconds left. He 
kneeled under the basket after 
the whistle blew, watching 
his college career flash before 
his eyes, as the Cougars had a 
chance to ice the game away at 
the free-throw line.

“I think people were down. 

I 
especially 
was,” 
Abdur-

Rahkman said. “But I’m a 
leader, so I have to keep that 
stale face and show strength. 
Coach (Beilein) was trying 
to boost us all up, because 
we were all kind of down. We 
thought it was over.”

Duncan Robinson was in 

a similar position. With 2:06 

remaining, he was called for 
his fifth foul in a tie game. 
It was just the fourth time 
the 
fifth-year 

senior 
forward 

had fouled out 
in his Michigan 
career, yet there 
he was, walking 
to the bench for 
quite 
possibly 

the final time 
in his Michigan 
career.

Junior 

forward Moritz 
Wagner went over to Robinson 
and tried to tell him that this 
wouldn’t be his last time, that 
he had seen his team pull out 
close games before and that 

he was about to see it again. 
But it’s hard to believe at that 
point.

“Michigan’s 

done so much 
for me, and I 
just didn’t want 
to go out that 
way,” Robinson 
said. “You know, 
that second half 
I didn’t feel like 
I played well. 
I just — I want 
it 
more 
than 

anything for my 

teammates, my coaches, this 
fanbase, the whole University, 
and I didn’t want to go out 
like that. For a second there, 
you try not to go to that place 

mentally, but I was fighting it. 
I was fighting it.”

John Beilein might have 

been the only one who kept 
the faith. Maybe it was just the 
coach’s façade they must put 
up to keep their team calm, or 
maybe it was that he knew his 
end-of-game play had worked 
before.

Either way, after Abdur-

Rahkman’s missed layup, he 
called his team over to talk 
about the situation. Beilein 
pointed to the clock. He was 
trying to get his team to believe 
that they had one last chance.

“We had a lot of time 

that we’ve been practicing 
the play,” Beilein said. “We 
decided we were going to run 

it. We had time.”

Added Livers: “He literally 

said, ‘Look. Look at that much 
time. 
That’s 

too much time. 
We’re 
good, 

we’re 
gonna 

go 
with 
that 

famous 
out-of-

bounds play.’ He 
has a lot of trust 
in that play.”

But 
it 
isn’t 

just 
that 
the 

play had worked 
before or that 
the Wolverines have won close 
games before.

Jordan Poole has literally hit 

that shot before.

Just 
last 
week, 
when 

Michigan 
held 
an 
open 

scrimmage, Poole hit a game-
winner from almost the same 
area of the floor.

“It’s like the same spot,” 

said fifth-year senior guard 
Jaaron Simmons. “That’s crazy 
to me. That’s crazy to me. But 
shoutout to JP, man.”

That’s not all, either. Livers 

says he’s seen Poole take the 
shot countless times before. In 
fact, he takes it at the end of 
his warm-up routine.

“I 
definitely 
just 
dream 

of 
shots 
like 
this,” 
Poole 

said. “I’m the one that, when 
the clock’s going down at 
shootaround, 
I’m 
the 
one 

dribbling and waiting to see 
if I can make the last shot. I 
missed it earlier when we were 
doing shootaround, but this 
last one I didn’t miss.”

There’s 
one 
more 
place 

you’ve seen that shot before. 
It’s in your dreams.

Any 
kid 
who 
has 
ever 

touched a basketball has taken 
that shot in their driveway. 
You count down the seconds 
in your head, like Poole at 
shootaround, and you wait 
until the last possible moment 
to heave it from deep and send 
your hypothetical team to a 
championship.

It isn’t the same, because 

Poole’s shot was real, but 
you’ve seen that shot before.

On 
Saturday 

night, 
Beilein 

called his go-to 
play 
with 
the 

season on the 
line, trying to 
salvage 
more 

time for Abdur-
Rahkman 
and 

Robinson 
and 

the rest of this 
team.

Poole got the 

shot that he and so many others 
have dreamed about taking.

And 
despite 
everything 

going on around him, it was 
easy to see it go in.

EVAN AARON/Daily

Freshman guard Jordan Poole hit the game-winning, buzzer-beating 3-pointer to lift Michigan to a 64-63 win over Houston in the NCAA Tournament.

Jordan Poole’s shot may have seemed like a prayer. But it’s something many should be familiar with.

Wolverines continue hot streak

With Big Ten play beginning 

in less than one week, the 
Michigan softball team looked 
to continue their 12-game win 
streak at the Miami Invitational 
in Oxford, Ohio. And led by 
an explosive offense and elite 
pitching performances, the team 
outscored their opponents, 35-0.

Freshmen pitchers Meghan 

Beaubien and Sarah Schaefer 
threw 
four 
complete 
game 

shutouts against Dayton, Miami 
(Ohio), Robert Morris and Fort 
Wayne.

The Wolverines opened the 

tournament on Saturday against 
Dayton with Schaefer in the circle. 
After setting down the Flyers in a 
1-2-3 first inning, Michigan took 
the lead in the bottom half of 
the frame. Junior infielder Faith 
Canfield scored on a double steal 
when junior outfielder Natalie 
Peters was thrown out at second 
base in her steal attempt. The 
one and two hitters, respectively, 
lifted the offense combining 
for nine hits and five runs on 
Saturday. The Wolverines tacked 
on three runs on four hits in the 
fifth inning — putting the game 
out of reach. Schaefer returned to 
the circle for the seventh inning, 
seeking the first complete game 
and win of her collegiate career. 
Just how she began the game, 
Schaefer retired her opponents in 
1-2-3 fashion to earn the complete 
game shutout.

In the second matchup of the 

day for Michigan, the offense 
opened up a four-run lead in the 
3rd inning against Miami (Ohio). 
Canfield turned on a pitch from 
the Redhawks, launching the 
first pitch of the at-bat over the 
left field fence for a two-run 
home run. This was all of the run 
support Beaubien needed. After 
getting out of a bases-loaded jam 
in the first inning and leaving a 
pair of runners stranded in the 
second inning, Beaubien got 
into a groove and surrendered 
only three hits on her way to a 

complete game and 7-0 victory.

On Sunday, the Wolverines’ 

bats picked up right where they 
left off on Saturday. In the top half 
of the first inning against Robert 
Morris, Michigan put up four runs 
led by two home runs off the bats 
of sophomore infielder Madeleine 
Uden and senior infielder Taylor 
Swearingen. Junior utility player 
Alex Sobczak contributed four 
RBI to the offensive display as 
Michigan put up 14 runs in total.

“I think we’re just attacking,” 

Canfield said. “We’re seeing the 
ball and we’re just going for it. I 
think hitting is contagious, that 
we’re just starting to get hot and 
everything’s just coming together 
at the right time.”

Despite how impressive the 

offense looked, Schaefer was even 
better.

She topped her performance 

from Saturday by retiring all of 
the batters she faced — throwing 
the first perfect game in program 
history since 2010. Not to mention 
that 
it 
was 
her 
nineteenth 

birthday.

Even though she was the star 

of the game, Schaefer was quick 
to credit her defense.

“I feel like they always have 

my back,” Schaefer said. “I’m a 
majority drop-ball pitcher, so I 
try to get the hitters to always hit 

it in the ground, so my infield is a 
really big part of my game and I 
felt like they just had my back the 
whole time.”

The game ended after five 

innings as a result of the mercy 
rule.

The 
Wolverines 
faced 
off 

against Fort Wayne in their final 
contest of the weekend. Like 
her previous outing, Beaubien 
escaped a bases loaded jam in 
her first inning after giving up 
two hits and walking a batter. 
Michigan took the lead in the 
bottom half of the inning, crossing 
the plate twice on two throwing 
errors by the Mastodons. Just as 
she did on Saturday, Beaubien hit 
her stride allowing only two hits 
after the first inning on her way to 
another complete game shutout.

And so, the streak continues 

for the Wolverines who have now 
strung together 16 consecutive 
wins, leading up to their first 
home game in Ann Arbor on 
Wednesday.

“I’m just really excited to get 

out there and show everybody 
what Michigan has to offer,” 
Schaefer said, “and I think that 
we’re in a really good spot right 
now and we have some things 
to work on but if they can keep 
getting better, I think we can be 
really great.”

Schaefer tosses perfect game 

Sarah Schaefer’s “K Counter” 

had five birthday cakes.

Every game, the Michigan 

softball team’s Twitter account 
tweets out a strikeout counter for 
the day’s pitcher using one emoji 
for each strikeout. Sometimes, 
it’ll be robots. Other times, it’s fist 
bumps. But Sunday wasn’t just any 
day for the freshman right-hander. 
It was her birthday, and the K 
Counter had the emojis to match.

At 
the 
Miami 
Invitational 

on Saturday and Sunday, senior 
right-hander Tera Blanco — the 
Wolverines’ usual No. 2 starter 
— never took the mound, which 
meant it was Schaefer’s time to 
shine.

On Saturday against Dayton, 

Schaefer — who has a 1.45 ERA on 
the season but averages just under 
three innings per appearance — 
got the start in the circle. There, 
the 
freshman 
right-hander 

dazzled, allowing just three hits 
and no walks with six strikeouts 
in Michigan’s 7-0 win. She earned 
not only the first complete-game 
shutout of her college career, but 
also her first win.

“It felt great to get a win for 

my team,” Schaefer said, “and the 
shutout was even better.”

That night, Schaefer brought 

cupcakes to the team’s hotel for the 
team to share. Sunday morning, 
she hung out with her parents in 
the hotel and posed for a photo 
with a wood cutout of a cake. But 
the best birthday present was still 
to come.

Before Schaefer threw a single 

pitch in Sunday’s game against 
Robert Morris, the Wolverines 
took a 4-0 lead in the top of the 
first. The pressure was off.

It took just 10 pitches for 

Schaefer to get her first three 
outs. It was foreshadowing for the 
trajectory of the game.

Lost in the offensive onslaught 

was something else — Schaefer 
wasn’t allowing any baserunners. 
Those that did realize gave her the 
silent treatment.

“We weren’t really talking about 

it because we didn’t want to jinx 
it,” said junior second baseman 
Faith Canfield. “But I think it was 
just (a) good atmosphere because 
we were hitting the ball.”

If the first several innings were 

sparks, the fifth inning was a full-
blown explosion. Michigan scored 
six runs to extend its lead to 14-0. 
Barring anything disastrous, the 
run rule would end the game in 
the next inning. When Schaefer 
came back out for the last inning, 
it dawned on her that she was still 
perfect.

“I kinda realized at the end,” 

Schaefer said. “ … I tried not to 
think about it in the last inning.”

And there it was. Two quick 

popouts and a strikeout, and 
Schaefer had a birthday present 
better 
than 
she 
could 
have 

imagined.

“She threw a perfect game,” 

Canfield said. “I think that’s good 
celebration.”

It’s only appropriate that on her 

birthday — a day all about growing 
up — Schaefer demonstrated her 
growth since the beginning of 
the season. At first, most of her 
appearances were in garbage 
time and Michigan coach Carol 
Hutchins treated her with a 
short leash. Before the weekend, 
Schaefer had 16 strikeouts. That 
number has now ballooned to 28. If 
Schaefer and freshman left-hander 
Meghan Beaubien — who also has 
a no-hitter under her belt — can 
continue their upward trajectory, 
the Wolverines’ rotation could 
become a sight to behold.

Now, Schaefer is the owner of 

the program’s first perfect game 
since 2010. And this weekend was 
just the beginning for an athlete 
with her whole career ahead of 
her.

“It’s always something you can 

work towards,” Schaefer said. 
“Just going out there and staying 
relaxed. It’s the best that you can 
hope for.”

Despite late scare, Michigan secures its first sweep of the season

Ben Dragani didn’t learn he’d 

be getting his first career start 
over the weekend series until 
Thursday night. Anxiety soon 
crept in for the freshman left-
hander as he readied himself 
for the Wolverines (7-11 overall) 
matchup against Bowling Green 
(3-16).

“I was a little nervous,” 

Dragani said. “I kinda didn’t 
know what to expect. I kinda 
had to talk to some other guys 
to get the routine down, but I 
just I fell back on what I did in 
high school.”

But those nerves did not 

show whatsoever, as Dragani 
dominated in the Wolverines’ 
5-4 victory, with six strikeouts, 
five hits allowed, no earned 
runs and no walks in seven 
innings of work.

Dragani — who began the 

season as a relief pitcher — got 
off to a hot start with a 1-2-3 
first inning.

With two outs in the second 

inning, after two Falcon singles, 
a pitch got away from senior 
catcher Brock Keener allowing 
the runner on second base to 
advance to third. On the very 
next pitch, the Bowling Green 
batter poked a ground ball 
between the shortstop and third 
baseman to score the game’s 
first run — the 
only run Dragani 
would allow.

After giving up 

two singles but 
no runs in the 
third, 
Dragani 

locked 
in, 

registering 
four 

straight 
1-2-3 

innings from the 
fourth 
through 

seventh innings.

“He’s 
a 
competitor, 
he’s 

very efficient in his pitches: no 
walks, no hit-by-pitches, very 
few three-ball counts,” said 
Michigan coach Erik Bakich. 
“I think it was 81 pitches in 
seven innings … it’s just hard to 

do. He’s got multiple off-speed 
pitches for strikes, including a 
swing-and-miss change up. I see 
him in our weekend rotation.”

Freshman outfielder Jordan 

Nwogu — who went 3-4 with 
two RBIs and a double — 

knocked 
what 

would turn out 
to be the game-
winning 
hit, 

as he ripped a 
two-RBI single 
passed 
the 

outstretched 
glove 
of 
the 

Bowling 
Green 
third 

baseman to give 
Michigan 
the 

5-1 lead.

“At 2-0 I knew he has to 

throw a fastball,” Nwogu said. 
“I kind of smiled; I looked 
at him and was like, ‘you’re 
throwing a fastball,’ and I hit 
the ball.”

Nwogu, who made his first 

three career starts in each 
game of the series, absolutely 
dominated the Bowling Green 
pitching staff, going 7-11 with 
eight RBIs, two doubles and a 
home run over the series. 

With Dragani cruising and 

the Wolverines holding a 5-1 
lead after seven innings, a 
victory 
seemed 
imminent. 

Dragani, however, far surpassed 
his season-high pitch count, so 
Bakich made the decision to go 
to the pen.

“It was the longest he had 

been in all season by far, so if 
we’re going to build him into a 
starter we can’t blow him out 
his first career start,” Bakich 
said.

Sophomore 
right-handed 

pitcher 
Jack 
Weisenburger 

came on in relief for the 
eighth inning and immediately 
struggled.

The 
first 
four 
batters 

Weisenburger faced all reached 
base, capped by a two-run 
double. Bakich decided to make 
another call to the bullpen. 
Enter junior left-handed pitcher 

William Tribucher.

Coming in with 12 strikeouts 

and just three earned runs in 
10.2 innings of work, Tribucher 
faced runners on second and 

third base with no outs.

The first two batters reached 

on a throwing error on a ground 
ball and a miscommunication on 
a bunt, respectively. Then with 
the bases loaded, no outs and 
only a one run lead, Tribucher 
flipped a switch. Three straight 
strikeouts later, the inning was 
over, and the Wolverines still 
held a one-run lead.

“That’s 
toughness 
right 

there,” Bakich said. “You come 
into a situation, you’re already 
in a storm, and the first batter 
you face is safe on an error, the 
next guy drops a bunt down 
and we don’t collect an out on a 
bunt, so now, all of the sudden, 
you’re in a bigger storm.

“A guy who maybe lacks 

toughness or lets doubt creep in 
or fear of giving up a lot of runs 
probably does just exactly that, 
gives up a lot of runs. He didn’t. 
He just looked like he stuck his 
chest out, pinned his ears back 
and said ‘Alright enough of 
this.’ ”

In the ninth inning, after 

giving up a walk to the first 
better, Tribucher came right 
back, striking out the next 
two batters he faced, inducing 
an easy ground ball to the 
shortstop for the final out.

Michigan had secured the 

series sweep.

Pearson leads Michigan to NCAA Tournament in first season as coach

The wait is finally over for 

the Michigan hockey team. 
Sunday, the NCAA Selection 
Show revealed that the second-
seeded Wolverines will travel to 
Worcester, Mass. to battle No. 3 
Northeastern in the first round 
of the NCAA Tournament.

The matchup will take place 

March 24 at the DCU Center, 
and if the Wolverines advance, 
they will face the winner of 
No. 1 Cornell and No. 4 Boston 
University in the quarterfinal 
game at the same location 
Sunday. 

Heading 
into 
the 

tournament, Michigan (20-14-
3) is tied with the Huskies (23-
9-5) at No. 8 in the PairWise 
Rankings. Northeastern runs 
a high-powered offense, with 
an average output of 3.62 goals 
per game — good for fifth in the 
nation.

When it comes to special 

teams, the Huskies shouldn’t be 
underestimated. They run the 
third-most effective power play 
in the nation, holding a 27.22 
goal percentage with the man-
advantage. The Wolverines, in 
contrast, are 36th in that same 
category.

Given this, Michigan coach 

Mel Pearson noted that special 
teams, and in particular the 
penalty kill, will be a major 
focal point as the Wolverines 
prepare for their upcoming 
match.

“We have to work on special 

teams,” Pearson said following 
the Selection Show. “… Our 
pace and tempo have to be 
good this week. We have to 
make sure we’re doing a lot of 
things defensively, with the 
zone coverage and a lot of back 
pressure and just getting ready 
to play hard without the puck. 
We’ll pay hard with it. But we 

have to make sure we have the 
mindset that we make sure we 
play extremely hard without 
the puck.

“I think it’s a 

good 
matchup 

for us.”

Michigan 

was one of four 
Big Ten teams 
to 
make 
the 

tournament, as 
Notre 
Dame, 

Ohio State and 
Penn 
State 

all 
received 

bids. 
The 

competitiveness 
of 
the 

conference this season was 
highlighted in the seeding — 

the Fighting Irish and Buckeyes 
both earned No. 1 seeds, in the 
East Regional and Midwest 
Regional, respectively.

The Northeast 

Regional is one 
of four separate 
regionals, 
each 

with a single-
elimination 
format. 
The 

winner of each 
secures a spot in 
St. Paul on April 
5 for the Frozen 
Four, 
meaning 

there are only 

four games between any team 
and the national title.

Despite 
the 
high 
stakes, 

single elimination nature of the 
tournament, the atmosphere of 
the selection show viewing was 
anything but tense. A beaming 
Mel Pearson addressed his 
team, the Children of Yost and 
other 
attendees 
before 
the 

show even began, making it 
clear that any location would 
be a good location — he was 
just thrilled that Michigan 
has made it to this place this 
season.

And while over the past 

couple weeks the Wolverines 
have been expecting a spot in 
the tournament, this was not 
always the case. Over the first 
half of the season, Michigan 
had just about as many wins 

as losses, so it is not lost on 
the team that what it has 
accomplished over the past two 
months is no small feat.

“I’m extremely 

proud of them,” 
Pearson 
said. 

“They’ve 
done 

a lot of heavy 
lifting. We had 
to 
improve 
on 

some areas — it 
started with our 
goaltending. 
We 
got 
good 

goaltending 
down the stretch. 
We had some of our younger 
players step forward and are 
getting a lot of contributions 

from different players. … Once 
you get in, anything is possible. 
I’m extremely proud of these 
guys, especially (how) they 
stuck together.”

While 
the 
team’s 

accomplishments 
were 

underscored with a No. 2 
seed and the opportunity to 
extend its postseason, Pearson 
received an honor of his own. 
During the Selection Show, 
he was recognized as the first 
ever collegiate hockey coach 
to 
consecutively 
take 
two 

different teams to the NCAA 
Tournament, as Michigan Tech 
earned a bid last season with 
him at the helm.

Though 
Pearson 
wasn’t 

aware of this accomplishment 
beforehand, 
it 
again 

reinforced Michigan’s quick 
transformation, growing from 
an underwhelming team last 
season to now inarguably one 
of the best in the nation.

Before the show started, 

highlight reels from games at 
Yost Ice Arena were played 
for the team and spectators 
to watch. These clips were 
yet another piece of evidence 
of 
the 
team’s 
brightest 

accomplishments, particularly 
over the past two and a half 
months. 

“I think (the clips) say a 

lot,” said senior forward Tony 

Calderone. “It 
shows some of 
the big games 
we won, and 
looking back on 
that, it shows 
that 
we 
can 

beat anyone in 
the country.”

And 
truly, 

what 
could 

be 
a 
better 

message 
for 

the Wolverines as they head 
into the final stretch of the 
postseason?

Season over

The best season in Michigan 

women’s 
basketball’s 
recent 

history ended quietly.

A trip to Waco, an 80-58 loss 

to No. 2 seed Baylor, a sad walk 
off the court. Quick, easy and 
quiet — the type of finish you 
don’t remember so much as the 
way they got there in the first 
place.

The 
Wolverines 
were 

destroyed by an onslaught of 
turnovers — 19 to be exact — 
enough to crush any chance of 
a historic upset. Though senior 
guard Katelynn Flaherty and 
junior center Hallie Thome 
dropped a combined 40 points 
with the former shooting 6-of-
14 from beyond the arc and the 
latter dominating the low post 
early on, Michigan struggled to 
gain traction anywhere else.

Sophomore forward Akienreh 

Johnson 
— 
whose 
scoring 

helped 
get 
the 
Wolverines 

into the NCAA Tournament — 
was held to just six points and 
junior guard Nicole Munger 
had just two to her name. 
Baylor dominated the boards, 
outrebounding 
Michigan 

by 20 thanks to an 18-point, 
16-rebound performance from 
Lauren Cox. Add all of that to 
the Wolverines’ turnovers and 
walking out of Ferrell Center 
with a win became nearly 
impossible.

“Sometimes I think we just 

see people and we try to get it to 
them quick and Baylor’s — their 
guards are super fast,” Flaherty 
said. “I think we had to get 
adjusted to the game. We made 
some turnovers and I think we 
got a little bit tight and made 
some more.”

Give 
Michigan 
credit 
for 

keeping the game close as long 
as it did. The Wolverines went 
into 
a 
hostile 
environment 

against a team that has lost just 
once all year and stayed within 
single digits through the first 

half.

After Baylor started out on 

a 7-2 run to open the game, it 
seemed the affair could get 
out of hand sooner rather than 
later. 
Instead, 

two 
straight 

3-pointers 
from 
Flaherty 

put 
Michigan 

back in front — 
and jolted the 
Wolverines into a 
run of their own. 
When Flaherty’s 
next triple came, 
it put Michigan 
up by five with 
just over two minutes to go in 
the first.

The Wolverines’ night only 

went downhill from there.

The Bears took off on a 

13-0 run immediately after, 
punctuating the display with 
a Juicy Landrum 3-pointer. 
Though the Wolverines managed 

to stay within 
a 
reasonable 

margin for the 
rest of the half 
— even cutting 
the 
deficit 
to 

three with two 
minutes to go in 
the second after 
a 
layup 
from 

freshman guard 
Deja Church — 
the game was as 

good as over.

Michigan’s best shot had 

come and gone. Even after 
pulling it back, the Wolverines 

went into the break down 42-34, 
a decisive margin against a team 
like Baylor.

Though the Wolverines hung 

around until midway through 
the third, a second 13-0 run 
from the Bears broke the dam. 
When Kalani Brown got a 
driving layup to fall with just 
over two minutes to go in the 
quarter, extending Baylor’s lead 
to 57-41, that was all she wrote 
for Michigan.

“They wore us down for sure,” 

said Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico. “No question about it. I 
thought we battled and hung 
tough and really fought and 
really tried to rebound in the 
first half and I thought they 
really wore us down physically 
(in the second).”

Neither Flaherty nor Thome 

— who had carried the offense 
earlier on — could find a rhythm. 
The two shot a combined 4-of-
18 in the second half. Kalani 
Brown 
turned 

her 
defense 

of 
Thome 
up 

a 
notch, 
and 

Baylor 
packed 

the 
paint 
to 

prevent her from 
going 
to 
spin 

moves. That was 
enough to keep 
her quiet.

When 

Flaherty 
exited 

the game — walking off the 
court for the last time with 
34.7 seconds to go in the game 
— Michigan coach Kim Barnes 

Arico embraced her, told her she 
loved her and thanked her for 
everything. The two were first 
connected via Barnes Arico’s 
husband, who saw Flaherty 
playing on a New Jersey blacktop 
as a child and relayed news of 
her to his wife, still a ways off 
coaching from the Wolverines.

When she got to Ann Arbor, 

Barnes Arico recruited Flaherty 
and built her program around 
the Point Pleasant, N.J. native. 
The 
last 
four 
years 
have 

constituted her reward for doing 
so.

“I made the best decision 

coming to Michigan, I would 
never change that,” Flaherty 
said, her voice cracking. “I mean 
I love my coach, I love Hallie — 
sorry — and my teammates. It’s 
a great school, I couldn’t do it 
without them.”

For senior forward Jillian 

Dunston, 
who 
rallied 
the 

Wolverines 
to 
a 
WNIT 

championship 
last 
season, 

whose defense and rebounding 
have buoyed the Wolverines 
all year, who does all the little 
things as well as Barnes Arico 
could ask, the emotion was less 
palpable.

“It was kinda sad, but I mean 

you kind of reflect, in that little 
bit of 10 seconds (walking off 
the court), of how great — I 
don’t know, Katelynn and I did 
a lot of good things,” Dunston 
said. “It’s sad that we lost, but I 

think our overall 
careers 
have 

been incredible.”

Now, 
their 

journey 
is 

complete. 
The 

ultimate 
goal 

— 
a 
NCAA 

Tournament 
berth 
— 
has 

been met, and 
exceeded 
with 

a 
first-round 

win over Northern Colorado on 
Friday.

The end it turned out, was a 

mere formality.
