JARETT ORR/Daily

Ann Arbor community members protest for housing justice outside Larcom City Hall Friday afternoon.

ANN ARBOR
Locals call for permanent housing 
establishments in Ann Arbor

Dozens of demonstrators gather to call for protections for homeless individuals

Gathered outside of Larcom 

City Hall April 9, dozens of local 
demonstrators stood with signs 
calling for housing justice — a 
message that would later echo 
down the streets in chants like 
“Homes for all, not just the rich” 
and “The city has the land, we need 
the housing.”

The rally was organized by 

Washtenaw Camp Outreach, a 
mutual aid organization working 
toward achieving housing justice 
and 
supporting 
the 
homeless. 

Prior to the event, WCO released 
a list of five demands urging the 
city of Ann Arbor and the Ann 
Arbor Downtown Development 
Authority to provide safe and 
accessible housing for the homeless 
population, particularly as many 
overnight shelters start to close due 
to the warmer weather. 

Among 
these 
demands 
are 

calls for the city to halt all camp 
sweeps on vacant city-owned land 
that unhoused individuals use. 
WCO also urges increased access 
to sanitation, enforced one-week 
notices for any evictions on private 
property and the creation of a safe 
emergency shelter at 721 N. Main St. 

WCO representative Cynthia 

Price told The Michigan Daily in 
an interview during the protest 
that one of the key demands on the 
list is giving housing power back 
to the community by converting 
public land into community land 
trusts. The demands name three 
locations to begin with: 721 N. 
Main St., 415 W. Washington St. 
and 350 S. 5th Ave.

“We’re asking (the city of 

Ann Arbor) to put land into a 
community land trust,” Price said. 
“It would allow for the community 
to figure out what we wanted to 
happen on a given swath of land 
and a nonprofit would hold that 
land. And so it would allow us to, 
instead of having to work with 
affordable housing, it would allow 
us to determine what needs to be 
done.”

Jim Clark, an active member of 

WCO who is recently experiencing 
homelessness, opened the event 
by emphasizing the importance of 
housing to survival, citing the “rule 
of threes” that determines basic 
human needs. 

“You can live three minutes 

without air, three days without 
water and three weeks without 
food,” Clark said. “Do you know 
how long you can live without 
heat? Three hours. Hypothermia 

is a very real thing and if you look 
at the weather, we think right now, 
it’s nice. But when it starts raining, 
if you have no place to go, if you’re 
stuck in the wet and the wind in the 
cold … when you force somebody 
to stay outside and inclement 
weather, you’re signing their death 
warrant. That’s not fair.”

Clark also also told The Daily 

that WCO is an organization that 
allows those who are experiencing 
homelessness to have more power 
and say in the organization’s 
actions.

“(WCO runs on a) consensus-

based leadership,” Clark said. 
“And that reflects on the deeper 
value of equal human rights and 
value. I think that’s speaking to the 
disenfranchisement of … one set of 
humans.”

WCO member Peatmoss told 

The Daily about their experience 
at a warming center — which are 
short-term 
emergency 
shelters 

open during inclement weather 
conditions — in Ann Arbor this 
past winter and how the mutual 
aid model of WCO helps the 
community address issues like 
police harassment. 

“The way that we self-organize 

is 
that 
we 
have 
community 

meetings where we decide what 
the rules are, how to keep each 

other safe,” Peatmoss said. “And 
in those meetings, we decided 
that the cops need to stay out. And 
that’s really important because the 
cops will come, trying to search 
up old warrants to the warming 
center, and that’s terrifying … If we 
don’t keep ourselves safe, nobody 
else will.”

Adam 
Harris, 
an 
Ann 

Arbor 
resident 
experiencing 

homelessness, spoke to the crowd 
about his demands to eradicate 
selling housing for commercial 
gain.

“We have to decommodify 

housing and decommodify things 
that we have a right to,” Harris 
said. “In our capitalist society, 
that seems impossible, but it’s not. 
There’s empty land and empty 
buildings right now that could 
be put to use. We see luxury 
apartments go up all the time … 
The city chooses to put private 
property and profit before people.”

Affordable housing options in 

Ann Arbor have long been an issue 
for residents, with many saying 
that businesses and developers 
have overtaken the market by 
increasing the number of luxury 
high-rise apartments downtown.

NEWS BRIEF
Some U-M clinics 
canceled, others 

to use Pfizer 

after Johnson & 
Johnson pause 
J&J sites at Michigan Stadium, 

Dearborn and Flint to be rescheduled

The University of Michigan’s 

vaccine clinics scheduled for 
students at the Michigan Athletics 
Indoor Training Center and Mejier 
April 13-16 will use the two-dose 
Pfizer vaccine rather than the 
Johnson & Johnson/Janssen, U-M 
officials wrote April 13 in an email 
to the campus community. The 
Michigan Medicine J&J clinics at 
Michigan Stadium April 19 & 20 
and April 14-16 in Dearborn and 
Flint have been canceled, and the 
hospital is “working to reschedule 
these as supplies allow.”

“If 
you’ve 
chosen 
an 

appointment at any vaccination 
clinic because of the one-dose J&J 
vaccine, please note that clinics 
will now be administering only 
the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, 
which require a second shot 
three or four weeks later,” the 
email read. “Getting a first dose 
this week would put your second 
dose — depending on vaccine — in 
early-to-mid May.”

Central Student Government is 

providing free bus transportation 
for students getting vaccinated 
at Meijer April 15 and 16. More 
information, including bus routes 
and times, can be found on 
michigandaily.com.

The Washtenaw County Health 

Department is also pausing use of 
the J&J COVID-19 vaccine until at 
least April 15, as recommended by 
the Food and Drug Administration 
and Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention the morning of 
April 13. The state of Michigan is 
also following the recommended 
pause. 

The federally recommended 

pause is “out of an abundance of 
caution”, the FDA tweeted April 
13, after rare blood clots were 
discovered in six American women 
who had recently received the J&J 
vaccine. Nearly 7 million people 
in the U.S. have received the J&J 
vaccine. The adverse side effects 
appear to be extremely rare, the 
tweet said. The CDC Advisory 
Committee 
on 
Immunization 

Practices will meet on April 14 

to discuss the complications, and 
the FDA will review that analysis 
before moving forward. 

A clinic scheduled for April 13 

in Chelsea, Mich., will offer the 
Pfizer vaccine instead of J&J, and 
a April 13 at Eastern Michigan 
University has been postponed. 
Two April 14 clinics, at Concordia 
University and EMU, are also 
postponed. 

While the U-M clinics are 

outside 
Washtenaw 
County 

Health Department jurisdiction, 
Public 
Information 
Officer 

Susan 
Ringler 
Cerniglia 
told 

The Michigan Daily it is possible 
Washtenaw County J&J clinics 
could resume vaccinations April 
15 after the CDC committee 
reviews the situation on the 14th.

“We should be considering 

them tentative at this point 
until more is learned, ” Ringler 
Cerniglia said. “Unfortunately, 
this week we had a large supply of 
Johnson & Johnson and scheduled 
a lot of clinics.”

Michigan 
Medicine, 

Washtenaw 
County 
and 
the 

state will continue to administer 
Pfizer and Moderna vaccines as 
previously scheduled.

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel had touted the benefits 
of the J&J vaccines in his April 
7 email announcing the student 
vaccination clinics, writing that 
its one-dose delivery makes it 
easier to administer to students 
leaving U-M campuses at the end 
of the semester. 

“The Johnson & Johnson/

Janssen 
vaccine 
is 
highly 

effective at preventing severe 
illness 
from 
COVID-19,” 

Schlissel wrote. “There is also 
accumulating 
evidence 
that 

vaccination prevents infection 
and transmission of COVID-19 
to others. It has already been 
administered to nearly 4 million 
people and is very safe.”

The Daily also has a running list 

of vaccination sites in Southeast 
Michigan that can be found at 
michigandaily.com.

Dissatisfied with offers from ‘U’

administration, LEO stages protest 
Other campus labor groups march in solidarity with lecturers

The 
Lecturers’ 
Employee 

Organization was joined by members 
of other campus labor organizations 
in displays of solidarity in a march 
outside of University of Michigan 
President Mark Schlissel’s house 
April 10. The protest aimed to 
assert LEO’s demands for their new 
contract in this current bargaining 
period which ends when the current 
contract expires on April 20. 

About 70 people attended LEO’s 

first in-person demonstration this 
semester. LEO hosted weekly virtual 
bargaining 
sessions 
beginning 

in January, which were closed to 
the public, and one public virtual 
bargaining session.

“Austerity has got to go,” was one 

of the protesters’ recurring chants of 
the afternoon — “austerity” referring 
to strict fiscal policies like budget 
cuts and salary freezes in times of 
economic crisis. Several campus 
community 
members, 
including 

members of LEO, have criticized 
the University for overusing these 
fiscal strategies during the pandemic, 
instead of tapping into surplus funds 
or the $12 billion dollar endowment 
with a proportion of discretionary 
funds. The University currently 
spends no more than about 4.5% of its 
endowment each year. 

In 
the 
ongoing 
contract 

negotiations, 
LEO’s 
demands 

include 
salary 
increases 
across 

the University’s three campuses, 
longevity raises and a reversal of 
the University’s controversial felony 
disclosure policy before the current 
contract expires. 

LEO President Ian Robinson, 

a lecturer at the U-M Ann Arbor 
campus, 
marched 
down 
South 

University Avenue with his fellow 
protesters, wielding yard signs that 
read “#Invest in Students #Invest in 
Lecs.

According to Robinson, April 9’s 

closed bargaining session featured a 
“very bad” salary proposal from the 
University and “very little” in the way 
of allocating greater funding toward 

the Flint and Dearborn campuses — 
a demand frequently echoed by the 
One University Campaign.

“This (protest) is a way now 

of demonstrating that we’re very 
unhappy with how far things are 
gone,” Robinson said. “We were 
told when we began bargaining 
that … the administration was very 
serious about getting our contract 
settled before it expires … but so far, 
what they’ve been doing at the table 
doesn’t suggest that they’re serious 
at all.”

In an email to The Michigan 

Daily, University spokesman Rick 
Fitzgerald said the most recent 
counter-proposal offered by LEO 
is about eight times the cost of their 
previous contract, the largest yet in 
LEO history. He said despite efforts 
to be more fiscally conservative in the 
next year, since the University is still 
recovering from the ongoing COVID-
19 pandemic, they have made fair and 
reasonable proposals.

Councilmember defends,
then apologizes for, posting 
homophobic slur on Facebook 
Comments from Jeff Hayner also disparaged local journalists

Ann Arbor City Councilmember 

Jeff Hayner, D-Ward 1, posted 
a quote on Facebook April 10 
containing a homophobic slur 
and disparaging journalists. He 
defended his use of the slur while 
repeating it in a phone interview 
with The Michigan Daily April 11 
night before apologizing in a April 
12 Facebook post.

In a now-deleted Facebook 

comment, Hayner quoted excerpts 
from 
Hunter 
S. 
Thompson’s 

1971 novel, “Fear and Loathing 
in Las Vegas,” one of which 
calls journalists a “gang of cruel 
(f*****s).”

Though 
Facebook 
removed 

the comment, Hayner originally 
commented multiple times under 
a post in the Ann Arbor Politics 
Facebook group about a MLive 

article discussing online hate 
against journalists. Hayner told 
The Daily a moderator of the 
Facebook group informed him 
the comment using the slur was 
removed after 10 minutes for 
violating guidelines.

On April 11, Hayner told The 

Daily he does not apologize for 
posting the comment and thinks 
his 
language 
should 
not 
be 

considered offensive since it was 
contained in a quote. 

“People who are offended by 

language like that are people who 
want to be offended by it… who let 
themselves be offended by it or who 
have an ulterior motive,” Hayner 
said. “They’re not my words.” 

But 
after 
facing 
increased 

backlash from the community, 
Hayner posted an apology in the 
Facebook group on April 12.

“I acknowledge the language I 

quoted is offensive, recognize my 
poor judgement in using it, and I 

sincerely apologize for the harm 
I have caused the community,” 
Hayner wrote.

In 
response 
to 
Hayner’s 

comments, Councilmember Travis 
Radina, D-Ward 3, called out 
Hayner in a Facebook post April 
11 condemning the language and 
sentiments expressed in the quote.

Radina posted the screenshot 

of Hayner’s use of the quote along 
with the contents of an email 
he sent to Hayner and all other 
councilmembers. In his Facebook 
post, Radina wrote that despite 
Hayner’s “prolific activity on social 
media,” Radina has not received a 
reply since he sent Hayner and the 
other councilmembers the email. 
In the email, Radina expressed 
disappointment 
and 
criticized 

both the use of the homophobic 
slur and the anti-press sentiments.

PUBLIC SAFETY
U-M student Mahnoor Imran joins 
UMPD Oversight Commission

After winning annual election, LSA sophomore aims to push for transparency

LSA sophomore Mahnoor Imran 

will serve as the newest member of 
the University of Michigan Police 
Department Oversight Committee 
for the 2021-2022 academic year 
after winning the annual election 
on March 24 and 25.

Imran 
received 
121 
votes. 

Engineering 
junior 
Josh 

Chapnick and LSA junior Justin 
Yuan, who both also ran for the 
position, received 54 and 14 votes, 
respectively. 

In a statement to the Michigan 

Daily, Yuan wrote that he didn’t 
announce an actual campaign 
or even really mean to run. As a 
member of the Young Democrats 
Socialists of America along with 
Imran, he voted with membership 
to unanimously endorse Imran for 
her write-in campaign.

“I supported and continue to 

support Mahnoor for the UMPD 
oversight commission,” Yuan said. 
“She’s compassionate, competent 
and incredibly smart.”

The function of the UMPD 

Oversight Committee is to help 
people 
with 
their 
grievances 

against U-M police officers or 
the 
U-M 
police 
department. 

The committee has a total of six 
members — two students, two 
faculty members and two staff 
members — who are nominated 
and elected by their peers. Students 
serve one-year terms, while faculty 

and staff serve two-year terms. 

Imran’s platform focused around 

fostering ties with the Advancing 
Public Safety Task Force created by 
University administration after the 
Graduate Employees Organization 
went on strike in Oct. 2020, 
with defunding the University 
Department of Safety and Security 
among their demands. Though 
this was not agreed upon in the 
University and GEO’s resolution, 
a variety of anti-racism initiatives 
— including the task force — were 
approved. 

Imran hopes to advance on the 

task force’s work during her term. 

“I 
wanted 
to 
push 
for 

transparency and accountability in 
the ways that are conducive to the 
kind of justice that I believe in,” 
Imran said. “My biggest concern 
is upholding public safety and 
public health in a way that centers 
community concerns.” 

Imran said she wants the 

community 
to 
recognize 
that 

having organizations such as the 
UMPD Oversight Committee is 
important because of the harm 
policing can cause. 

“We need people who can 

advocate for public safety in a more 
nuanced way that acknowledges 
that harm,” Imran said. “It’s 
definitely a very interesting space 
to enter, but I want to listen to 
everyone’s thoughts and what they 
have to say.” 

Sarah Peitzmeier, chair of the 

UMPD oversight committee, said 
having 
student 
representatives 

on the committee is a legal 

requirement and has also been very 
beneficial. 

“I 
certainly 
agree 
that 

it’s 
really 
important 
to 
have 

feedback 
and 
input 
from 
all 

different 
constituencies 
on 

campus,” 
Peitzmeier 
said. 

“Student perspectives need to be 
represented.”

Imran agreed with Peitzmeier, 

saying students’ voices need to 
be amplified throughout campus, 
especially when she sees the change 
they are pushing for as a necessity. 

According to Peitzmeier, one of 

the committee’s main goals for this 
year is to expand the committee 
powers to increase transparency 
and responsibility within UMPD. 
Members also plan to work to 
adjust the committee’s bylaws 
allowing the committee to publish 
public reports on the committee’s 
work, for example, which they are 
not currently able to do because of 
vague wording in the bylaws. 

“We’re moving through the 

stages of negotiation processes and 
have had a very positive experience 
so far,” Peitzmeier said. “It seems 
like the PD is also invested in 
increasing community trust.” 

U-M Chief of Police Robert 

Neumann, who works directly 
with the oversight committee, 
wrote in an email to The Michigan 
Daily he supported expanding 
the 
committee’s 
power 
while 

maintaining operational efficiency. 

“I support any measure that 

enhances 
transparency 
and 

accountability while ensuring that 
legal and structural boundaries 

are not compromised,” Neumann 
wrote. “A process is underway 
to 
evaluate 
the 
Committee’s 

request, and I am supportive of 
steps that build confidence in our 
accountability.”

In the face of increased public 

attention on policing practices, 
Neumann identified strengthening 
community ties and the promotion 
of community dialogue as two areas 
in which he hopes the department 
can improve. He also emphasized 
the increased importance of public 
accountability for police officers. 

“Accountability 
and 
the 

perception of accountability are 
essential components of sustaining 
the 
community 
partnerships 

necessary for serving the needs of 
our community,” Neumann wrote. 
“I see increased public attention to 
policing as an opportunity to learn 
and grow in the ongoing work to 
earn trust.”

Imran said she hopes to use 

her platform to ensure people in 
a position of privilege will take on 
this obligation to do more for their 
community and that the support 
from her community was a major 
factor in her decision to run. 

“At the heart of it all was 

community,” Imran said. “I would 
not have been able to achieve this 
victory without the support of my 
friends and community members.”

For The Daily

“Setting aside your tirade against 

the free press, the thoughtlessness 
and disregard you displayed for our 
LGBTQ residents in sharing such 
a quote is extremely concerning 
and hurtful,” Radina wrote. “In 
2021, LGBTQ residents – especially 
LGBTQ youth – in one of the most 
progressive cities in Michigan should 
never be subjected to elected officials 
cavalierly utilizing homophobic slurs 
to insult their perceived adversaries 
or to advance a political point of view. 
It is disappointing. It is harmful. And 
frankly, it makes me question the 
sincerity of your supposed support 
for the LGBTQ community.”

Hayner said on April 11 he supports 

the LGBTQ+ community and is 
disgusted by Radina’s suggestion that 
he has harmed anyone. He told The 
Daily he made the comment because 
he has been harassed by the media 
and believes some members of the 
press are not trustworthy. 

“I feel very strongly that some 

media can be trusted and some can’t,” 
Hayner said. “I feel strongly that 
way because that is how I have been 
treated … For (Radina) to suggest in 
any way that I don’t support individual 
rights … is disgusting and disturbing 
and it’s offensive to me. There is 
no questioning my commitment 
to human rights, to LGTBQ rights 
and to move in our society forward 
together with equality. And for him to 

even suggest that shows how little he 
knows about me.” 

Hayner 
is 
no 
stranger 
to 

controversy on the council. In 
December, MLive reported he had 
added a second floor to his Ann 
Arbor home without a permit. 
Hayner maintained he did nothing 
wrong, but has faced angry public 
commenters since the addition was 
reported. 

On the 11th, Hayner also defended 

quoting the excerpt to The Daily 
by adding he has friends who are 
members of the LGBTQ+ community, 
that the slur has been in print for 
decades and that it was used by 
Thompson, an acclaimed journalist, 
in an important piece of literature. 
Hayner said he has not been 
contacted by community members 
and, because the comment was not 
directed at anyone in particular and 
claimed that because the slur itself is 
“archaic” and “hardly ever hear(d)” 
anymore, it is not offensive. 

“If you take something out of 

context to stir up outrage, then you’re 
gonna get outrage,” Hayner said. “If 
you read things in context or you 
know where it came from or know 
what kind of person I am, you’re 
not outraged by it. If somebody is 
offended by seeing that word in print, 
take it up with the publisher.”

Councilmembers have previously 

raised concerns about Hayner’s 
behavior on social media.

As of April 11, Hayner told The 

Daily he had not seen Radina’s 
Facebook post but had a reply 

prepared to his email. Hayner added 
he felt it was wrong for Radina to 
publicly post about the quote before 
having a private conversation with 
him.

In a comment on Radina’s 

Facebook post, Councilmember Jen 
Eyer, D-Ward 4, thanked Radina for 
speaking out and said she stands with 
the LGBTQ+ community.

Washtenaw 
County 

Commissioner Katie Scott, D-District 
9, posted a letter to the Ann Arbor 
City Council to her Facebook page 
the evening of April 11, urging them 
to “affirm the open and welcoming 
community we have in Ann Arbor,” 
and signed it from a “proud LGBTQ 
elected official.” 

“There must be a reckoning,” Scott 

wrote. “We have a choice to create 
a transformative culture here that 
supports each resident, or we have 
a choice to engage in perpetuating 
harmful stereotypes and being part 
of a regressive culture. By using 
quotes like this in a public forum, 
it paves the way for more hatred 
and homophobia; it legitimizes it. 
I’m here to stand up for the LGBTQ 
community today.” 

In his Facebook post, Radina 

questioned the intent of Hayner’s 
comments 
and 
Hayner’s 

unwillingness to apologize to Ann 
Arbor’s LGBTQ+ community. He 
added he feels angry and exhausted 
needing to respond to anti-LGBTQ+ 
hate a week after the anniversary of 
the election of Kathy Kozachenko, 
the first LGBTQ+ person elected to 

public office in the U.S. Kozachenko 
was elected to Ann Arbor City 
Council in 1974, when she was a 
21-year-old student at the University 
of Michigan.

“I 
am 
deeply 
disappointed, 

angry, exhausted, and frustrated 
that just a week after celebrating 
the anniversary of the first LGBTQ 
person elected to public office, I am 
being forced to address and condemn 
the 
reference 
of 
bigoted 
and 

homophobic language by one of my 
colleagues,” Radina wrote. “This also 
comes less than a week after some of 
us on Council had to dedicate time 
to educating our colleagues about 
the threat that white supremacy and 
white terrorism poses to the (Asian 
American and Pacific Islander) 
community.” 

In a statement to The Daily, 

Radina said he cannot comment on 
the consequences he believes Hayner 
should face since has not yet received 
a reply from Hayner. However, he 
said it is unequivocally Hayner’s 
responsibility to repair the harm 
he has caused toward the LGBTQ+ 
community.

“It cannot be anyone else’s 

responsibility (to reach out to the 
LGBTQ+ 
community),” 
Radina 

said. “That, however, also requires 
a genuine acknowledgement and 
acceptance of the harm caused, true 
remorse and a real willingness to 
learn and do better.”

ANN ARBOR
Ann Arbor residents debate replacing Woody Allen 
mural amid resurfacing of sexual assault allegations

Screenwriter’s portrait is among four other writers on the painting at the corner Liberty Street and State Street

A prominent mural on the 

corner Liberty St. and State St. 
has acted as a central hallmark 
for downtown Ann Arbor since 
1984. The mural — commonly 
referred to as the Bookstore 
Mural — depicts portraits of 
five well-known writers: Franz 
Kafka, Hermann Hesse, Edgar 
Allen Poe, Anaïs Nin and Woody 
Allen.

A new HBO docuseries, Allen 

v. Farrow, revisits the sexual 
abuse allegations against Allen 
made by Dylan Farrow, Allen’s 
adopted daughter, in 1992 when 
she was 7 years old. Farrow is 
now 35 years old. 

Allen is known for his career 

as a screenwriter, actor, author 
and American film director, but 
allegations against Allen have 
followed him for decades. After 
the #MeToo movement began 
gaining momentum in 2017, the 
allegations became debilitating. 
Many actors and filmmakers 
alike have now denounced Allen 
and have refused to work with 
him.

With Allen’s sexual assault 

allegations 
resurfacing, 
Ann 

Arbor residents are engaging 
in 
a 
renewed 
debate 
over 

replacing Allen in the mural 
downtown. A discussion in the 
Ann Arbor Townies! Facebook 
group garnered attention from 
residents, raising questions of 
the mural’s feasibility and ethics. 
A majority of the residents 
wanted the mural taken down.

The debate with Allen’s mural 

isn’t the only one of its kind. 
Especially after the Black Lives 
Matter 
protests, 
numerous 

monuments 
and 
campus 

buildings across America that 
have come under scrutiny due 
to its memorialization of white 
supremeicists. 

Ann Arbor resident Mikki 

Moscara said she would like to 
see the painting of Woody Allen 

either taken down or repainted 
with a new writer.

“I think Woody Allen should 

be replaced or removed (from 
the mural) mainly because of 
the situation that transpired,” 
Moscara 
said. 
“Having 
that 

(mural) up in Ann Arbor, is it 
really good for the reputation of 
Ann Arbor?”

Allen has consistently denied 

the allegations and has never 
been tried or convicted for 
the sexual abuse accusations. 
Citing these reasons, two Ann 
Arbor residents who wish to 
remain anonymous due to fears 
of personal and professional 
retribution 
have 
told 
The 

Michigan Daily they believe the 
painting should be kept in place. 

They will be referred to as Julia 
and Philip for the remainder of 
the story. 

Julia called discussion around 

the depiction of Allen in the 
mural “old news.”

“I 
don’t 
understand 
the 

resurgence 
of 
this 
culture 

where if someone is accused 
of a crime, they are deemed 

immediately guilty,” Julia said. 
“Who gives you the right to 
destroy something because you 
have a misguided idea of what 
happened, and you don’t even 
have the facts?”

Ypsilanti 
resident 
Andrea 

Krueger, a semi-retired social 
worker and yoga instructor, 
agreed, saying she believes the 
mural’s original purpose was 

only to acknowledge Allen’s 
work as an artist.

“At the time the mural was 

commissioned, it wasn’t known 
about his proclivities,” Krueger 
said. “And the spirit was not 
even to highlight his personal 
life at all; it was merely to 
acknowledge him as a renowned 
filmmaker.”

Others like Philip, who has 

requested anonymity, said some 
of the other writers on the 
mural have also had their share 
of scandal. Edgar Allen Poe 
married his 13-year-old cousin 
when he was 27. Anaïs Nin had 
two husbands — one in New York 
and the other in Los Angeles — 
who each did not know the other 
husband existed. Franz Kafka 

allegedly 
had 
contradictory 

views on sex, who was described 
by a friend as being ““tortured 
by his sexual desires.”

“None of the people on that 

painting are innocent,” Philip 
said. “The one person in that 
whole group we couldn’t say had 
some weird sexual tendencies is 
Hermann Hesse.”

Allen is the only one of the 

five accused of sexual assault.

Philip said they would like 

to keep the mural as a point of 
discussion about the past.

“It’s 
been 
there 
since 

1984,” Philip said. “If we start 
censoring the past, we’ll never 
learn from it.”

Similarly, Krueger said she 

believes keeping Allen on the 

mural 
can 
prompt 
critical 

thinking about his controversial 
past.

“It provokes questioning, and 

I think that’s a very good thing,” 
Krueger said. “By whitewashing 
out Woody Allen, there’s nothing 
to think about, is there?”

In contrast, Moscara said 

she believes Allen should be 
replaced to reflect Ann Arbor’s 
progressive culture.

“In regards to honoring the 

past, … things change, and it’s 
okay to change,” Moscara said. 
“He doesn’t have to be there, I 
feel like it’s not as important for 
him to be there as it is more so 
to change and be a little bit more 
progressive.”

Moscara suggested a few 

people she thinks could replace 
Allen.

“I 
think 
having 
someone 

from Ann Arbor would be really 
great,” Moscara said. “Some 
people 
suggested 
Iggy 
Pop. 

Robert Frost lived in Ann Arbor 
for a little while.” 

LSA sophomore MacKenzee 

Van Buren said she believes 
adding writers of color or female 
writers would be a welcome 
addition to the mural, which 
currently showcases four white 
men.

“I think there are more 

influential, deserving writers 
out there that can be put on the 
mural instead of Woody Allen,” 
Buren said. “I think removing 
Allen opens the potential for 
making a more representative 
mural.”

Moscara also said she believes 

adding different writers from 
diverse 
backgrounds 
would 

better represent Ann Arbor’s 
diverse culture.

“I think that in itself would 

be more progressive, and that 
would show Ann Arbor’s true 
face, or what makes Ann Arbor 
great,” Moscara said.

BUSINESS
Ross School of Business Dean 
steps down from position

Scott DeRue to enter private sector after five years at University

University 
of 
Michigan 

Ross School of Business Dean 
Scott 
DeRue 
announced 

April 9 he would be stepping 
down from his position on 
May 23 to take on a new role 
as a senior executive in the 
private sector. 

There 
is 
currently 
no 

replacement dean following 
DeRue’s 
departure. 

University 
Provost 
Susan 

Collins 
will 
appoint 
an 

interim dean at the end of 
the semester, who will work 
closely with DeRue to ease 
the transition. 

DeRue became the Business 

School Dean in 2016. In the 
time since, every program 
in the Business School rose 
to a Top 10 ranking while 

others made it even further. 
In a personal message to the 
Business School community, 
DeRue 
said 
he 
felt 
very 

fortunate to have had this 
role. 

“Serving as your Dean for 

the past five years has been 
the 
greatest 
professional 

honor of my life,” DeRue 
wrote. 
“Because 
of 
your 

commitment 
to 
excellence 

and passion for our mission, 
over the past 5 years, we 
have been able to achieve 
great things, for which I am 
extraordinarily proud of and 
grateful for all of you.”

While 
DeRue 
has 
been 

Dean, he wrote the Business 
School also made significant 
strides 
to 
become 
more 

inclusive, 
with 
an 
20% 

increase in enrollment and 
introducing Diversity, Equity, 
and Inclusion requirements 

into the core curriculum.. 
However, many students have 
called out the business school 
for its lack of diversity. 

Moving 
forward, 
DeRue 

wrote he was confident that 
the Business School is heading 
in the right direction.

“The road ahead will be 

full of new opportunities 
and challenges, all of which I 
am excited about, especially 
knowing that I will continue 
to have the University of 
Michigan and Ross School 
community in my corner, 
supporting me every step of 
the way,” DeRue wrote. 

In his message, DeRue said 

Collins will release more 
details about the interim 
dean soon.

ADMINISTRATION
Has Ron Weiser been ‘canceled’?
Following recent calls for regent’s resignation, use of 
‘cancelation’ ties into political, social connotations

Before the Board of Regents 

voted to censure one of their own, 
Ron Weiser (R), for statements 
he made referring to presumably 
Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Secretary 
of State Jocelyn Benson and 
Attorney General Dana Nessel as 
“witches” and contemplating the 
assassination of Republicans who 
voted to impeach former President 
Donald Trump, he offered a 
statement in defense of his words.

“I take full responsibility for 

what I said,” Weiser said at the April 
2 meeting. “I agree with part of this 
resolution, but I will not resign… I 
will not be canceled.”

The majority of the Board of 

Regents went on to vote in favor 
of his censure — with Katherine 
White (D) absent from the meeting 
and Weiser and Sarah Hubbard (R) 
both abstaining — and called on 
him to resign. Weiser seems to have 
left the Zoom call shortly after the 
resolution passed, and he did not 
respond to The Michigan Daily’s 
request to comment.

Weiser said he would not be 

“canceled,” which is a phrase that 
has been used online since at least 
2013 but began to take on new 
political meanings with Trump’s 
election, academics say. It started 
as slang among Black Twitter users, 
and since has become a nebulous 
term 
that 
refers to calling out 

people for words or actions deemed 
harmful, racist or inappropriate. 

The 
term 
“canceled” 
has 

developed different uses across 
political and social spaces, typically 
meaning people should remove 
support for high-profile figures 
due to their behavior. Celebrities 
have been “canceled” for racist, 
sexist and illegal actions — and 
they have lost sponsorships and 
platform monetization as a result. 
For politicians, the impacts of 
“cancelation” typically end with 

online shaming, since it becomes 
difficult for those doing the 
“canceling” to translate internet 
buzz to real-world change in the 
form of recalls or resignations.

Born on Black Twitter, 

“canceled” takes on different 

meanings

Though Weiser used the word 

canceled to liken his situation to 
ongoing 
conversations 
around 

free speech and accountability, 
canceling began with a far different 
meaning — it was slang specific to 
Black spaces on Twitter.

Phrases like “dragging” someone 

or something or “reading” them, 
which both refer to a type of sharp 
rebuke, have similar origins to 
“canceling.” These phrases began 
to pick up traction in majority Black 
online spaces for being catchy, 
according to Lydia Kelow-Bennett, 
an associate professor in the 
Department of Afroamerican and 
African Studies.

As these phrases started getting 

used more and more on social 
media, they eventually got picked up 
by mainstream culture, though the 
meaning of the term shifted slightly.

Early 
on, 
“canceled” 
was 

used simply as a term to refer to 
celebrities 
like 
cook-turned-TV 

star Paula Dean, who was called 
out for racist behavior and lost 
her Food Network contract. The 
phrase then went on to become a 
“culture” as early as 2013. When 
the term transformed into a 
more mainstream culture, this 
inspired “moral panic” within 
predominantly 
white 
spaces, 

Kelow-Bennett said.

“It’s just the word that we use to 

say, ‘I don’t want to pay attention to 
you anymore,’” Kelow-Bennett said. 
“To call it a ‘culture’ is to suggest that 
it has more firm meaning and more 
practice behind it than it actually 
does. By calling something a culture, 
you consolidate it in a way that makes 
it easier to have a panic about.”

When performed collectively, 

“cancel culture” is a form of online 
boycotting, says Montana Miller, 
an associate professor in the 
Department of Popular Culture at 
Bowling Green State University. 

This form of protest provides 

people — those who, unlike Weiser, 
do not hold elected seats or their 
own businesses — with an avenue 
for publically voicing their qualms, 
Miller said. Though the term can 
be meant frivolously when used 
to call out celebrities, she said 
the cancellation of businesses or 
public officials is often the product 
of meaningful online grassroots 
organizing.

“The whole purpose of cancel 

culture is that a wide swath of real 
people who do not sit in seats of 
power can voice their displeasure 
with powerful people who do 
horrible things,” Miller said.

The politics behind cancel 

culture

In recent years, politicians, 

usually those right of center, began 
using the phrase to decry what 
they see as an attack on their right 
to free speech or unnecessary 
concern with their lack of political 
correctness.

Michael 
Traugott, 
research 

professor at the Center for Political 
Studies who has taught in both the 
Communication and Media and 
Political Science departments, said 
Weiser and other conservatives 
will apologize for what they were 
“canceled” for saying but will 
maintain that they had a right to 
say it. These politicians will also 
attempt to frame the cancellation 
as a challenge to their freedom 
of speech. The argument that 
cancellation is a political weapon 
used by liberals is exacerbated by 
the nation’s hyper-polarization, 
Traugott said.

Ah, summer vacation. The sacred three-

month period of underpaid jobs, midday naps 
and in all honesty, too much TV. Although 
some may find this assessment pessimistic, it’s 
an accurate summary of my past two summers 
(minus being able to secure a job — sorry Mom). 

Last summer, constrained from most 

productive activities by the pandemic and 
low personal funds, I opted to embrace the 
latter pursuit of TV-watching. My program of 
choice, you may ask? The one and only “Rick 
Steves’ Europe.” 

This wasn’t my first time watching the PBS 

travel show. In fact, its jovial theme song has 
been ingrained in my head for what seemed like 
eons. Over the last few years, my grandmother 
came over to my house almost daily so my mom 
could care for her. She suffered a decade-long 
battle with Alzheimer’s and it was practically 
impossible to pass the time with things she 
still enjoyed. Bingo and puzzles, the usual fare 
for elderly pastimes, were a no-go. Although 
my grandmother used to paint beautiful 
Monet-inspired landscapes, she couldn’t quite 
operate the paintbrush anymore. Even going 
on walks around the neighborhood was out 
of the question. The only activity that seemed 
feasible was watching TV. 

So each afternoon, like clockwork, I parked 

myself on the couch, and we alternated 
between the Turner Classic Movies channel 
and “Rick Steves’ Europe.” After watching 
copious amounts of the former, I learned that 
old movies could really be hit or miss. As a kid, 
I thought that any movie made before 1960 
had to automatically be good, but after a while, 
the plot-lines get flimsy, the acting gets over-
the-top and the Mid-Atlantic accents become 
grating. Hey, we can’t all be “Citizen Kane,” 
right? 

But watching “Rick Steves’ Europe” was 

different. It was a breath of fresh air, an 
opportunity for me to live vicariously through 
host Rick Steves as he ambled across the Swiss 
Alps or the Cinque Terre. I may have been 
sitting in the Long Island suburbs, trapped 
in the grips of mid-summer lethargy, but 
watching “Rick Steves’ Europe” felt like an 
almost educational experience. I now held a 
surplus knowledge of European travel, and 
most importantly, my grandmother seemed to 
be somewhat satiated. 

We breezed through at least five episodes 

a day, touring the Tuscan countryside and 
Norwegian fjords. I was amazed at the ease 
with which Rick struck up a conversation 
anywhere he went, discussing street food 
recipes and the country’s political climate 
with locals like they were old friends. Rick, 
mild-mannered and sincere, never missed 
an opportunity to provide a thoughtful social 
and historical commentary as he restaurant-
hopped or took in spectacular views. The 
show doesn’t veer toward gimmicks or 
generalizations, and you get the sense that Rick 
really loves what he does.

On days when the toll of my grandmother’s 

illness was particularly dispiriting, “Rick 
Steves’ Europe” felt like something to escape 

into, even if it was just for an hour or two. 
Some of these days proved more difficult than 
others. I watched as it became harder for her 
to walk, eat and speak like she used to. Despite 
seeing her almost every day, I hadn’t really had 
a conversation with my grandmother for over 
two years. This didn’t stop me from asking her 
which medieval castle from the past episode 
she liked best or whether she’d been to that 
city with my grandfather before. Because even 
though things were different, even though 
I knew she didn’t understand every word I 
said, I still saw that flicker of love and humor 
and spunk behind her eyes. My grandparents 
had loved to travel, and watching “Rick 
Steves’ Europe” felt like a way to remind my 
grandmother of that happiness. 

Dusty photo albums are hidden away in 

cabinets and boxes chronicle my grandparents’ 
travels through Europe. I have memories of 
them bringing back Eiffel Tower keychains 
from Paris and small enamel jewelry boxes 
from Lisbon to give my siblings and me when 
we were kids. I always knew that they loved 
Europe, from the Carmen opera records we 
danced to in their basement to the French 
cuisine my grandfather cooked. As the children 
of immigrants who grew up in Depression-era 
Queens, their ability to travel later in life always 
felt meaningful.

She passed away two months ago, and I 

never really got to say a proper goodbye. I 
wasn’t living at home when it happened, so 
I mourned away from the rest of my family 
and away from the place that I had shared so 
many hours with her. It was a strange feeling, 
not having any clear last words or images 
to remember her by, but then again, our 
relationship had never really been about the 
words.

On a random night a few weeks after it 

happened, I was struck with the sudden 
impulse to turn on an episode of “Rick Steves’ 
Europe.” Despite watching over 10 seasons 
of the show, I realized that I’d never actually 
watched it alone; it was always an activity 
shared between my mom, grandmother and 
me on hazy summer afternoons. I scrolled 
through Prime Video and settled on an 
episode from Season 2 called “The Best of 
West Ireland.” I had seen it millions of times 
and would probably have heavily protested 
watching it only a month prior, but it felt right 
in that moment.

My grandmother’s mother had grown 

up in the same emerald hills Rick traversed 
on screen, and I realized that watching him 
again helped me mourn. He had become so 
synonymous with that time spent with my 
grandmother that I found immense comfort 
in just the cheery swell of the show’s theme 
song. We had probably watched “Rick Steves’ 
Europe” on our last day together, and although 
it seemed unnatural to do so alone now, it was 
strangely cathartic for my grieving process.

“Rick Steves’ Europe” is a safe haven for me. 

My grandmother and I spent most of our time 
in the confines of my living room, but watching 
the show never once felt like a chore. I’m 
forever thankful for the quirky, khaki-donning 
travel guide who helped create a connection of 
love between my grandmother and me, even 
when we didn’t have the words to do so.

How do you describe something that you 

feel within yourself but are scared to look at? 
This feeling that you can poke and prod while 
understanding that examination would lead to 
rumination would lead to turning your whole 
life upside down? Fleeting thoughts percolate on 
the banks of memory and pull little by little; the 
silt builds and builds until it can’t be ignored. I’m 
sure I’m not the only one who has felt this way, 
as the past year of quarantine provided everyone 
with ample opportunities to self-reflect and face 
issues that had long been on the back burner.

The pandemic also allowed me to watch a lot 

of television — specifically, a lot of cartoons. Since 
January 2020, I have watched 14 animated TV 
shows and about 30 movies (including the entire 
Studio Ghibli catalog). Something about the 
medium of animation captured my attention 
and provided stability for me throughout an 
unstable, unprecedented year. When I commit, 
I commit hard: My most recent binge-watch 
was all 274 episodes of the acclaimed Cartoon 
Network epic “Adventure Time.”

Now you may be thinking, what’s the math? 

Why is this adult writer talking to me about 
something I watched in fifth grade and promptly 
forgot about? I promise you it makes sense. Just 
tuck yourself in, snuggle under a freshly knitted 
blanket and allow me to regale you with a story 
about how cartoons helped me come to terms 
with myself. It’ll be mathematical and cuckoo 
banana pants, I promise.

It all comes back to that feeling, that 

discomfort of something not sitting right with 
your brain before you hide it away and hope it 
fades. That started for me around my freshman 
year of college. I started thinking of questions 
that challenged my heterosexuality, so naturally, 
I said “Nope!” and forgot about them for a 
while. Just like anything else, these questions 
resurfaced a year later with a vengeance and 
demanded my attention. Being a busy college 
student, I took my time answering them and 
never got around to a satisfactory response. How 
could I question my sexuality after living one 
way for 20 years? It was like waking up one day 
and questioning if gravity existed: absurd, stupid 
and obviously a silly waste of time.

As a distraction, I decided to do a rewatch 

of “Avatar: The Last Airbender,” which truly is 
as great as people say. When I ran out of those 

episodes around mid-February, I hopped into 
the more controversial sequel series, “The 
Legend of Korra,” and found myself enamored. 
These shows were my comfort food: well-
written stories matched with gorgeous 
animation to create a feast for the eyes and 
brain. Both shows are worth the watch, yet 
what caught me off guard with “Korra” was 
the series finale’s implication that the female 
lead, the eponymous Korra, ended up not 
with her male love interest Mako, but her gal 
pal Asami. Something as small as two women 
holding hands on network TV (sadly, the best 
they could do in 2014) filled me with immense 
joy. And I didn’t know what to do about it.

So, I ignored it. I finished up my semester 

smiling on the outside and spiraling on the 
inside, unable to talk about my personal crisis 
because the world was on fire. So much was 
going on in those early months of 2020 that I 
felt guilty taking the time to think about myself. 
Then I watched “She-Ra and the Princesses of 
Power,” and my walls began to crumble. Silt 
was tumbling all around me, and with nowhere 
else to turn, I had to focus on it.

“She-Ra,” a Netflix reimagining of the 

popular Filmation series of the 1980s by 
showrunner Noelle Stevenson, is gay. There’s 
simply no other way to say it. The content of 
the show is fantastic — it’s a riveting adventure 
full of twists and turns and iconic characters — 
but that doesn’t stop it from being queer to the 
core. Adora is caught in a will they-won’t they 
relationship with her fre-nemisis Catra, Bow 
has two lovely gay librarian dads and Netossa 
and Spinerella are the lesbian “moms” of 

everyone’s dreams. That’s not even mentioning 
the pan/bisexuality of just about every single 
character or the groundbreaking non-binary 
representation of the shape-shifting, actor-for-
hire Double Trouble.

Watching just after the fifth and final 

season aired, I followed the Best Friend 
Squad of Adora, Bow and Glimmer all around 
Etheria as they tried to stop the Horde. There’s 
something so refreshing about a show being so 
chock-full of queer characters but not making 
a big deal out of it: In Etheria, love is simply 
love. Full stop. I found that I related to nearly 
all of these characters (I’m a HUGE Catradora 
supporter), but I was particularly drawn to 
Double Trouble. There was something so 
enticing about being outside our standard 
gender binary, about choosing where you 
identify more one day over the next.

Starting “Steven Universe” right after 

finishing “She-Ra” (and forcing just about 
everyone I knew to watch it) affirmed one 
thing: Queer stories made me feel at home. 
There was something so comfortable about 
the openness and unabashed love they had 
for queer characters. They weren’t a token, an 
exaggeration or a two-second kiss that could 
be cut for the international release — these 
sapphic, bi, non-binary, gay and aromantic/
asexual characters were whole people.

It was now June, three months into my 

journey of self-discovery, and though I was 
more comfortable with the idea of my changing 
identity, I had no solid ground to stand on 
yet. There were no labels I felt comfortable 
identifying with since the ideas were so 
nebulous and dynamic. During Pride month, I 
didn’t feel like I could join in because I had no 
idea where to slot myself into the community. 
It was lonely. Thankfully, cartoons came to my 
rescue once again.

Episode 37 of the first season of “Steven 

Universe” is called “Alone Together.” In 
it, Steven fuses with his friend Connie to 
form a singular person stuck smack dab in 
the middle of being masculine or feminine. 
When they show off their fused form (named 
Stevonnie) to the Crystal Gems, Pearl sees it as 
unnatural, Amethyst compliments them and 
Garnett walks up to them and says, “You’re 
not two people and you’re not one person. You 
are an experience. Make sure you’re a good 
experience.” To Garnett, it doesn’t matter who 
Stevonnie is, it matters that they enjoy being.

I paused the episode and took that in. I didn’t 

need to know how to make a sandcastle out of 
the silt yet; I could simply enjoy being around it. 
Labels are well and good, but it’s also more than 
okay to exist liminally, to be between labels as 
you take time discovering which one fits you 
best. I was content not knowing.

Cartoons allow for the abstraction of 

complicated concepts like death, love and 
gender. They have to so that they can get past 
the harsh censorship of Cartoon Network, 
Disney and Nickelodeon executives. But this 
abstraction also more accurately portrays the 
queer experience. For most people, myself 
included, the process of coming to terms with 
one’s queerness is not a straight line. The 
journey is bumpy and twisty and confusing, but 
abstractions can act as a homing beacon to help 
us find our way back. Even if everyone’s journey 
is different, we still understand the important 
aspects that connect us, and there’s no better 
medium to express that than cartoons.

It wasn’t until August when I was watching 

the underrated and thankfully queer “Harley 
Quinn” that I came out to someone. Even 
then, I didn’t have all the answers about what 
I wanted to be called or who I wanted to love, 
but I was okay not knowing at that moment. I 
was thankful to have someone who, even if he 
didn’t understand me, heard me. And that was 
enough.

If I’m being honest, I don’t even have all the 

answers now, just about a year after my self-
examination started. That’s okay. The journey 
doesn’t really end, so it’s a good thing I’ve got 
plenty of diverse cartoons to watch in the 
meantime.

I was only 12 years old when my older sister 

and I first danced in my kitchen to “What 
Makes You Beautiful” by One Direction. We 
baked cupcakes and dyed icing pink and 
replayed the song until we knew every word. 
We discussed choosing favorites: Mine was 
Liam and hers was Niall. I can’t pinpoint 
exactly when my total obsession with the 
boy band happened. All I know is that after 
that day, the trajectory of my teenage years 
was drastically altered by five pop stars with 
luscious hair and British accents.

Over the course of four years, I traveled 

throughout the East Coast with my sister to 
see One Direction 15 times in six states and 
I noticed something: I was seeing the same 
people at every concert I went to. Together 
we formed a smaller, in-person community 
outside of the wider One Direction fandom that 
only existed on social media. I referred to real 
people by their Twitter handles. I met online 
friends in person; we teamed up while camping 
out for NBC’s “Today” show and ABC’s “Good 
Morning America” in New York City for days at 

a time. We loved every second of it.

Being a member of the One Direction 

fandom became my personality. My sister 
and I would stay up late and talk about their 
albums, their personal lives or the next time 
we were going to see them. One Direction 
was the spark in my friendship with my sister, 
and I’m not sure if we would be this close 
today without them being our primary topic 
of conversation for over four years. I grew 
up with One Direction as my biggest 
influence, whether it be their music or 
the people they brought into my life or 
their upcoming performances.

Having an online community 

waiting for me at home was a blessing 
during middle and high school. I felt 
closer to the online fandom than I 
did to some of my “real” friends. I 
was exposed to diverse people from 
around the world, and it was not 
uncommon for our relationships 
to start off revolving around One 
Direction before gradually transforming into 
something more personal. We would talk 
to one another about where we were from 
and what we were going through. These 
conversations played a significant role in 

developing my understanding of different 
cultures and lifestyles while simultaneously 
showing me that shared interests can help 
bridge the gap between those different groups.

Because I lived on Long Island, Manhattan 

was only a train ride away — meaning that any 
time One Direction was staying in the city for 
a concert or event, my sister and I were on the 
next train. Whether or not we had tickets, we 
would try and catch a glimpse of our idols. 

The rush I felt when I checked Twitter for 
updated information on their travel plans was 
unlike any other. It may sound creepy and a 
little strange, but the thought of catching a 
glimpse of my icons was thrilling. If I’m going 

to be completely honest, I’ve waited for days 
at a time behind a barricade outside several of 
Manhattan’s most expensive hotels, and I’m 
not ashamed. I know what you’re thinking: 
That’s weird. And it is.

But it’s also how I learned to be 

independent, social and self-sufficient. When 
you’re waiting outside of a hotel for hours on 
end with strangers, there’s not much else to do 
but talk. And when you have to get from one 

side of the city to the other, you have 
to learn how to navigate the subway. 
I attribute 100% of my subway skills 
to being a fan of One Direction. Who 
knew that being a Directioner would 
equip me with street smarts? When I 
wasn’t busy navigating Manhattan, I 
took it upon myself to watch as many 
interviews and read as many fanfics as 
possible. Fans would write full-length 
novels and publish them on Wattpad 
for other fans to read. It was somewhat 
embarrassing to be caught reading 

a fanfic, but I couldn’t consider myself a true 
fan if I wasn’t consuming every piece of One 
Direction-related media I could find.

Today, I listen to One Direction’s music 

and I’m torn between feelings of joy, nostalgia 

and heartbreak. Yes, I’m still grieving over 
their breakup. But the warm memories outdo 
the sadness, and I’m reminded that all good 
things come to an end: a lesson that everyone 
must learn.

The five pop stars that were more or less 

forced into a certain genre of music broke out 
of their boyband bubble to explore their own 
music styles, and I don’t blame them. That’s a 
part of growing up too. For them, the process 
entailed exploration. For me, it required 
understanding.

From attending concerts to navigating the 

subways to meeting new people from around 
the world, One Direction has profoundly 
impacted who I am today. I enjoy talking 
to people from different backgrounds. I’m 
comfortable figuring out how to get around a 
new place. Most importantly, I’m extremely 
confident that I will always remember the day 
I met Harry Styles as the best day of my life.

It’s quite upsetting that I hit my peak at 

age 13, but that’s fine by me. I wouldn’t take 
back any of my boyband-related shenanigans 
because I know that, when I reminisce on 
my teenage years, One Direction will be 
responsible for a solid chunk of my most 
meaningful memories.

read to songs we listened to — has 

changed us as we’ve grown. We’re 

here to talk about the things that 

brought comfort during a difficult

In one of my clearest childhood 

memories, I’m standing in the wings of a 
stage. I’m eight years old and I’m a little 
out of breath, having just sprinted from the 
dressing room to the stage. I’m nervously 
rolling and unrolling a comic book — my 
only prop, which I took very seriously — in 
my hands as I wait for the lights to go down 
and the scene to transition.

The last note of a song rings through the 

theater, the spotlights turn off, 
the crowd cheers. The 
stage manager waves 
a hand urgently, I 
straighten the vest 
that I’d been put in 
for my little role as a 
citizen of River City, 
Iowa, and I step out to 
find my mark.

Back then, I had 

aspirations of becoming 
a Broadway star. My 
part as a background 
townsperson in this 
community production of “The Music Man” 
was enough to get me dreaming. Maybe 
this was just the first step. Maybe I’d get an 
even bigger role in the next show, and things 
would fall into place from there.

Everything in the world was possible and 

wide open then. If I worked hard enough, 
what would stop me from doing anything I 
wanted to do? It was never even about fame 
— something I could hardly conceptualize 
at the time — but the fun of performing, of 
stepping out in front of other people and 
telling a story.

But I got older, and my ability to be 

comfortable on a stage shrank as I lost 

the self-assurance kids are blessed 
with. I stopped performing. My dreams 
shifted away from being a Broadway 
star and gradually worked their way 
down to earth. Eventually, after so long 
with my head in the clouds, I found 
myself with two feet on the ground. The 
great big world of possibilities shrunk 
to fit between the narrow walls of my 
own capabilities and other people’s 
expectations.

There’s probably a connection there 

between how I stopped being able to 
express myself both as an actor and in 
real life. The ability to wear every emotion 

plainly and feel them deeply became 

harder to do in real life as it 
became impossible to do on 
a stage. No one told me that 
growing up would make 

me reticent, more afraid 
of my own feelings, 

more afraid of what 
other people would 
think 
about 
them. 

But I kept theater with me, 

even though I moved from the 

stage to the audience. Of all the 

things that I loved in my childhood, 

it’s the only one that’s grown with me. I 
can’t count how many productions I’ve 
seen, but they span years and continents. 
Musicals make me less jaded, even when 
getting older demands pessimism and 
weariness. I don’t know another medium 
that allows, if not requires, the same kind 
of frank emotional exposition. In order for 
the story to move along, everyone has to 
say exactly what they’re feeling so that the 
audience can feel it too. The Phantom has 
to tell everyone how ugly he is; Jenna has to 
mourn the person she used to be; Evan has 
to apologize as his lies unravel; Bobby has 
to reconcile with his loneliness.

Whenever I sit in a theater, I let my 

guard down. When I do, nothing can 
command my attention the way that a 
good show can. Even though the nature of 
an audience involves being surrounded by 
other people, I find the theater a solitary 
experience. My phone stays off. I don’t 
move from my seat until curtain call, even 
during intermission. I don’t say much to 
anyone who comes with me. For two or so 
hours, I’m completely content to be alone 
in my head.

Letting the theater’s darkness settle over 

me like a weighted blanket and letting all of 
the emotions coming from the stage — no 
matter how dramatic or over-exaggerated 
— allows me to experience everything with 
more emotional clarity. Most of the time, I 
have what I think must be a life-changing 
realization about myself or the world or the 
universe after I’ve seen a show. It’s never 
actually as profound as I think it is, but it 
means that I’d let go of some of my reticence 
and hesitation, at least for a little while.

Basking in the loneliness — welcoming 

it rather than shoving it away — invites 
me to feel everything more acutely than I 
normally would. It’s strange, but I think I 
owe it to the people performing. They put 
on such displays of emotion that it makes me 
think it’s only fair for me to feel my own in 
return.

Personal 
growth 
isn’t 
linear, 
but 

sometimes I think I’ve only regressed from 
the person I was when I was eight — the 
person who let herself feel everything, who 
was so excited to perform because she was 
totally undaunted. The theater makes me 
feel like that person again; it lets me take a 
step back in order to move forward with 
greater clarity. I learn — or, maybe, relearn — 
something about myself every time I’m in an 
audience. I leave the theater having grown 
into my own skin just a little bit more.

Some things escape your notice until 

they’re pointed out to you, and then they 
become all you can think about. This was the 
case with the first girl I ever really noticed as 
beautiful — not beautiful, attractive. And it’s 
the case with every love song sung by a woman 
that I’ve listened to, where she uses the word 
“she” or “her” to reference her lover.

The thing is, heterosexual love songs don’t 

seem particularly gendered until you realize 
that you don’t quite fall into that realm all the 
time. Or even most of the time. And you don’t 
notice how unusual it is to hear LGBTQ+ 
romantic songs until the word “she” pops out 
of absolutely nowhere, making you sit down 
and stare at absolutely nothing — feeling your 
thought patterns exploring this word and self-
inserting as you rewind the song.

Like many pansexual or bisexual people, I 

started off thinking that my first “thing” for a 
girl was something that would happen maybe 
once or twice in my life. “I’m not bisexual, I 
just like girls sometimes,” I would insist. Let’s 
just say that’s something to laugh about now.

Music surrounded the first girl I realized 

I was attracted to. We found that we had 
the same favorite lyric in a particular song, 
something about God and swimming pools. 
My Spotify was a portal to getting to know me, 
she told me. I insisted to myself that my feelings 
for her were a rare one-off in my life; I created 
percentages of attraction in my head, weighted 
toward men. In reality, breaking love and other 
feelings down into math, just like with music, 
makes them lose some of their meaning. 

And slowly, I began to notice when women 

sang about female lovers.

Sometimes, the songs were passionately 

centered on the anger of the woman-loving-
woman experience, using sex as defiance 
against those who would hate them because 
of their love. In Rett Madison’s “God is a 
Woman,” Madison describes her knees as 
“shaking” and “purple” as a woman kissed 
them. The uncertain, nervous trembling 
contrasted with the sureness of the romantic 
experience laid out a story in my head to match 
my feelings.

I would lie awake in bed at night, listening to 

“Lorraine” by Big Thief over and over and over 
again. The “soft burning hands” mentioned 
didn’t belong to a man. They couldn’t. There 
was something about Adrianne Lenker’s quiet 
singing, thinking about a woman in a way 

filled with desire, but without the force of a 
man, that made me shiver.

The possibility of hands touching me that 

didn’t belong to a man — of saying “This is my 
girlfriend,” of tucking a girl’s long hair behind 
her ear — all presented themselves to me as 
new possibilities. They were scary to explore 
and dream up on my own. So, a variety of 
female musicians did it for me. Slowly, I began 
to look for women singing about female lovers.

In “She,” Dodie sings hesitantly and sweetly 

about noticing all the different things that 
make you crush on someone — and, for the 
first time, noticing them about a woman. The 
woman she dreams of smelled of “lemongrass 
and sleep,” and I wondered what sleep smelled 
like. “Georgia” by Emily King is a song born 
from heartbreak like many others, except that 
she is begging a female lover to return. And, of 
course, “Graceland Too” by Phoebe Bridgers 
filled me to the brim and then spilled over a bit 
every time I listened, especially when I finally 
listened closely enough to realize that it was 
about a woman.

Just like that, it was as though some puzzle 

had been solved. Had other songs I hadn’t 
listened to closely enough also contained 
sapphic stories? Were there many more to 
listen and dream to? Was it just one big gay 

treasure hunt? Even now, when I am fully 
confident in calling myself pansexual and 
when I often notice women more than men, 
these songs leave me with the same sense of 
awe and shy interest that they always did. The 
casual wonder with which Bridgers views her 
lover eating saltines on her floor mimics the 
way I have looked at a girl I care about when 
she frowns at her homework or watches a 
streetlight change from behind the wheel. 

Devotion of any kind is about small 

attentions, noticing the things that others won’t. 
Dodie, Bridgers and countless other women 
have marked down all the little ways that their 
partners are unique and special. With love 
songs that relish in the privilege of noticing the 
small things about the women they adore, they 

mark the individuality of their lovers.

And it is important to me, and I’m sure 

to other listeners, that sometimes these 
individuals are women. With each different 
gay love song I found, a new path of dreaming 
presented itself.

For a while, I admired the boldness and 

assuredness with which they addressed 
themselves. But for a while, personally, I didn’t 
want my sexuality to be a lens through which 
I was perceived. Though I’m no songwriter, 
nowadays, I nevertheless find ways to explore 
queerness in my creative work (obviously). 
It’s funny how the love of others makes you 
consider the love within yourself. It’s funny 
how lucky their wonderful music makes me 
feel to experience the same love.

One of my proudest moments at four 

years old was memorizing all the lyrics to 
“Hang Me Up To Dry” by The Cold War 
Kids. I sang it confidently to my parents one 
evening, a cappella. Along with The Cold 
War Kids, my father force-fed me music by 
the Rolling Stones, The Black Keys and Red 
Hot Chili Peppers, among others. He did 
everything he could to make sure that his 
music taste was ingrained into my head. 

Every night, the lullaby my father sang 

me was his own rendition of “Yellow” by 
Coldplay — except in his version, “yellow” 
was replaced with “weasel,” his nickname 
for me when I was young.

Cartoons and movie nights were 

replaced with music video watch parties. 
My favorite DVD was “Slowboat to Hades,” 
an interactive rendition of music videos 
and concert clips accompanying the release 
of the Gorillaz album Demon Days. My 
Christmas gift at six years old was a first-
generation iPod Nano, pre-downloaded 
with all of my father’s favorite songs. I 
stayed up well past my bedtime replaying 
“Brick” by Ben Folds Five and listening to 
Radiohead. 

Looking 
back, 
passing 
down 
his 

knowledge of music was one of the few 
hobbies my father could easily share with 
me. My father has been in a wheelchair 
for my entire life, so teaching me how to 
play sports, cook or use tools was out of the 
question. Listening to music was something 
to bond over and an activity he was always 
able to partake in.

His 
music 
taste 
stuck 
with 
me 

throughout my early adolescent years, up 
until middle school when I decided that I 
had been deprived of listening to the “Top 
40” played repetitively on the radio. As I 
began to branch out into an entirely new 

realm of music — boy bands, indie-pop 
and eventually rap — the shared interest 
between me and my father diminished. 
Our common ground developed into me 
complaining about listening to Iron & 
Wine at dinner, and him complaining about 
playing J. Cole and Kanye in the car. 

At the beginning of high school, the 

relationship between my father and me 
strayed even further. After a surgery, he was 
placed into long-term in-patient care. I saw 
him every other night for dinner. We caught 
up about what was happening at school, how 
cross country was going, what I was going 
to be up to over the weekend — the basics. 
There was little time for mindless bickering 
about the legitimacy of electronic music 
and why I should listen to a “real band” like 
Nirvana. Our similarities naturally lessened, 
and we began to grow apart.

A couple months later, when my father 

was finally allowed to continue his care at 
home, I was already immersed in the world 
of alternative R&B, trap music and EDM. 
The lyrics to “Hang Me Up To Dry” had 
faded from my memory and the songs from 
my iPod were entirely left out of my Liked 
Songs on Spotify. Conversations about 
music became few and far between with 
my father. The only time it was brought up 
was when my father would decide to test 
me on my music knowledge while one of his 
playlists looped during family dinner. As the 
years went by, my guesses for “Who sings 
what?” became more inaccurate. 

During my senior year of high school, 

my father was in and out of the hospital for 
weeks at a time. One morning, as I sat half 
asleep in my 8 a.m. statistics class, I received 
a call from an unknown number. Much 
to my surprise, it was my father calling 
me from the hospital. With more pep in 
his voice than normal and a slight sense of 
urgency, he asked if I could do him a “huge 
favor” — bring his headphones over to the 
hospital after school.

That afternoon, I stayed with him in his 

hospital room until the sun set. I sat next to 
him doing homework while he caught up 
on all the new album releases he had missed 
while in the hospital. Every now and then, 
he would insist that “I had to hear” the song 
he was listening to. I reluctantly listened to 
them and secretly enjoyed all of them. He 
then had me help him create a new playlist. 
I titled it very literally, “Made with Dad in 
the Hospital.” During the creation of the 
playlist, his song additions sparked some 
of my own suggestions for the playlist. 
We began to banter again about various 
songs and artists. I vouched for some of my 
favorite songs while he did the same for his, 
and we surprisingly agreed on an extensive 
list of songs. I came to the realization that 
my father’s music taste had rubbed off on 
me a little more than I would’ve liked to 
admit. 

All it took was one playlist to spark a 

period of growth within our relationship. 
Our love for music converged once again. 
I began to revert back to my roots, from 
R.E.M. to Beck. I actively searched for 
music that I enjoyed, in the hope that my 
father would too. Our conversations were no 
longer filled with small talk about our days. 
Instead, they were characterized by drawn-
out discussions of new albums, music videos 
and performances. I even relearned the 
lyrics to “Hang Me Up To Dry.”

Though music was not the defining 

factor of me and my father’s relationship, 
it functioned as a kind of guide, marking 
the different stages of our bond. Our 
likes and dislikes amplified the highs and 
lows of our relationship. Our growth was 
reflected in our music. As the relationship 
matured, the breadth of our music scapes 
overlapped more and more. Music was 
never the sole reason we grew apart, but 
it was the turning point in finding our 
way back to common ground, and to each 
other.

There is much to be said about a film’s 

ability to influence the viewer. We all have a 
movie that gave us chills and stayed front-of-
mind long after we left the theatre. When I 
saw the 1985 film “Come and See,” I couldn’t 
understand how people stood up so quickly 
when the credits began to roll. I had been 
immobilized by the apocalyptic imagery of 
Nazi brutality and sat slack-jawed as fellow 
movie-goers gathered their things and 
discussed dinner plans. Movies like this have 
the potential to change the way we perceive 
and comprehend the world. But sometimes, 
it is the viewer who changes the film. As we 
grow and change, our understanding of a 
movie will change with us.

I recently watched “High Fidelity” for the 

third time. The movie, released a few months 
before I was born in 2000, introduces the 
audience to Rob Gordon (John Cusack, 
“Being John Malkovich”) as his girlfriend 
Laura (Iben Hjejle, “Defiance”) is walking 
out the door. Rob, a former DJ and Chicago 
record store-owner, is no stranger to break-
ups. Throughout the film, Cusack breaks the 
fourth wall as Rob directly addresses the 
camera, walking us through his romantic 
history and quest to understand why he is 
fated to be rejected.

Rob is something of an antihero. Viewed 

according to 2021 standards, the film 
capitalizes on antiquated tropes about 
heterosexual relationships and a hefty dose 
of misogyny. By 2000 standards, this is just 
another movie about male dysfunction. 
Scott Tobias of The Guardian says that Rob 
“is kind of a jerk,” and describes the Nick 
Hornby book on which the movie was based 
as an “incisive dissection of the pop-addled 
male brain.” To put it more simply, Rob is 
a man-child with ill-founded ideas about 
women and their role in his life. “High 
Fidelity” is not life-changing, and it hasn’t 
altered the way I perceive anything. Except, 
maybe, Jack Black’s ability to cover Marvin 
Gaye.

What has changed, however, is my 

perception of the film itself. When I first 
watched “High Fidelity,” I was 13 or 14 
and had recently discovered the world of 
collecting vintage vinyl. If I recall, I was 
disappointed to learn that the movie poster 
was a bit misleading: The film was more 
about record store-owner than record store. 
This explains why I more clearly recall the 
Championship Vinyl scenes than I do the 
scenes in bars and restaurants.

My next encounter with “High Fidelity” 

took place a few years ago, when I was 
probably 17 or 18. This time, with my 
initial delusions dispelled, I knew what 
I was getting into. No longer focused on 
the vinyl aspect, I actually appreciated it 
more. Rob has pretty good taste, and boy, 
can Jack Black sing. Reflecting now on my 
first rewatch, my memory seems to fixate 
on Rob’s dysfunction. I may have seen too 
much of myself in self-conscious Rob for 
comfort, and as an anxious teenager, I was 
a bit disconcerted. Rob is sad, selfish and 
more deserving of pity than sympathy. I did 
not want to be Rob.

Now, rewatching “High Fidelity” again, I 

still see myself in Rob, but not as the selfish 
mope. When Laura leaves, Rob undertakes 
the reorganization of his large record 
collection “autobiographically.” In order to 
find a song, he’d need to scour his memory 
for the person or event to which that song is 
attached. This is a very minor plot point, and 
it is meant to support the point that Rob has 
an obsessive personality. I was struck by this 
scene, not because I heal emotional wounds 
through reorganization (if only it were 
that easy), but because there is something 
poignant 
about 
turning 
that 
sorting 

compulsion on one’s own personal history in 
a time of crisis.

Rob is still a problematic character on the 

third watch. His ironically simultaneous 
fears of commitment and rejection are likely 
to linger despite his making up with Laura 
at the film’s conclusion. The insecurity and 
selfishness which struck a minor chord with 
my 17-year-old self have been replaced by my 
identification with Rob’s desire to find and 
create order in a disordered world. 

“High Fidelity” is defined by lists. Rob 

is always making them, often with his 
friends, otherwise for the camera. In fact, 
the narrative structure is oriented around 
Rob’s Top Five Worst Breakups — you see 
here a hint of his misogyny as he reduces 
women to ordinal items. Music is the source 
material for most of the film’s lists, with 
one example being “Top Five Songs for a 
Monday Morning.” If you’ll indulge me, and 
in no particular order: “Feeling Good” by 
Nina Simone, “7 AM” by Jacqueline Taieb, 
“Sunday Morning” by Amanaz (ironic, I 
know), “It’s Summertime” by Morcheeba 
and “Beggin’” by Frankie Valli and the Four 
Seasons.

Rob’s list-making is shown as a symptom 

of his dysfunction. We get hints of this 
obsessive quality elsewhere in the film, like 
Rob’s hypocritical focus on Laura’s post-
breakup sexual activity and the way he seeks 
absolution from obsession over the “top five” 
exes. Rob is not a healthy man, but there is 
something else at work here. The characters 
gloss over his record reorganization, but it 
reveals an interiority that is lacking in the 
rest of the movie.

To construct this “autobiographical” 

system, Rob must draw on a mental timeline 
of emotional memory. His musical catalog 
becomes a playable chronicle of his life. His 
new system will be totally nonsensical to the 
outsider, suggesting that Rob sees his now 
Laura-less apartment as a sanctuary and 
extension of himself. 

And sweetest of all, when he sits down to 

make Laura a mixtape at the end of the film, 
he must first make a sort of memory playlist, 
curating an emotional experience for Laura 
from events that may even predate her.

“High Fidelity” is about much more than 

a self-loathing and obsessive-compulsive 
record store owner. The viewer is welcomed 
into an emotional world defined by music, 
arranged like a setlist and highly curated, for 
better or for worse. This was lost on me when 
I first watched and then rewatched the film. 
On the first go, my initial misconceptions 
left me dialed into the music alone, generally 
uninterested in Rob’s romantic woes. The 
second round was subconsciously sour, as 
Rob’s insecurities hit too close to my own and 
left a bad taste in my mouth. Now, I watch 
his romantic incompetence with pity while 
focusing on his pathological need to impose 
order. On the third go, the film is much more 
interesting.

Rob’s lines and lists are the same as they 

were when I was 14. All that has changed is 
me. From viewing to viewing, I traversed 
setting and superficiality toward plot 
and character, and beyond to subplot and 
consequence. I only imagine that next time 
I will come full circle to the superficial and 
spend the whole time trying to identify 
the many Chicago and suburban filming 
locations. “High Fidelity” is no cinematic 
masterpiece, but my experience with the 
film embodies one of the ways that personal 
growth can alter our perception of art and 
media.

Content warning: Mentions of 

eating disorders.

The voice in my head sneered, 

Still too high, you’re a failure, as I 
yanked on the fat of my stomach. I 
was in my bathroom, trying to calm 
myself down and stop the moisture 
overpowering my eyes. My mom had 
bought a different type of yogurt that 
week at the store because it was on 
sale, but it was 30 calories more than 
the usual brand. An unpeeled apple 
is 90 calories, six almonds are 42, one 
cup of cooked broccoli is 35, two eggs 
are 180. Total calorie intake: 650. My 
mind was scrambling to recalculate: 
Well, if I take out the almonds and 
exercise for an extra 20 minutes 
tonight, I can still make my calorie goal, 
I rationalized.

***

Last week, while scrolling through 

my Instagram Explore page to avoid 
homework, I came upon a video that 
showed how to make something 
called “nature’s cereal.” I was curious 
and so I did more research. Originally 
created by Tik Toker Sherwayne 
Mears, nature’s cereal consists of 
coconut water poured over a mix of 
blackberries, blueberries, raspberries 
and pomegranate seeds. This trend 
blew up when singer Lizzo shared a 
video on Tik Tok trying it for the first 
time.

Now, I love an unexpectedly 

delicious food combination (trying 
ketchup on mac and cheese was truly 
a life-changing experience). And if 
Mears and Lizzo love nature’s cereal, 
who am I to judge? But the underlying 
issue with the nature’s cereal trend 
is that it can be misinterpreted, 
especially by impressionable youth, 
to demonize regular cereal with 
milk for being unhealthy while 
inadvertently 
idolizing 
nature’s 

cereal for being lower in calories. 
If we are continuously bombarded 
with content proclaiming that cereal 
is making you fat or that switching 

from full-fat milk to skim milk 
will aid weight loss, we start to 
subconsciously label certain foods 
as “bad.” Gradually, we might start 
to avoid them or feel that we have to 
“earn” these foods through exercise. 
Even if we were able to enjoy these 
foods blissfully in moderation before, 
we might now feel guilty for eating 
them or that we need to substitute 
“bad” ingredients in a recipe like 
butter or sugar for “good” alternatives 
like avocados or apple sauce. 

Take, for example, the Instagram 

handle for the account on which I 
first saw the dish: @eatthisnotthat 
— a page is filled with posts that 
encourage you to suppress your 
cravings for unhealthy food with 
“clean alternatives” to cut calories. 
Nature’s cereal is full of antioxidants, 
vitamin C and other essential 
nutrients, but we should take it for 
what it is: fruit in water. We must 
avoid putting certain foods and meals 
on pedestals. To function, our bodies 
require many different nutrients that 
come from a balanced diet made up of 
a variety of foods, including ones that 
make us happy. 

The set of beliefs that idolizes 

thinness, perpetuates fatphobia and 
vilifies “unhealthy” foods is known 
as “diet culture.” It goes farther than 
to tell us to cut back on donuts and 
fried foods. Instead, it creates a fear 
of food and not exercising which 
can lead to disordered eating habits 
and potentially full-blown eating 
disorders. Diet culture taunts: “You 
can’t have a flat stomach if you snack 
in-between meals.” “Stop eating by 8 
pm.” “Don’t eat fruits that are high in 
sugar.” “Keep away from unnecessary 
carbs.” “Never ever let your discipline 
waver.”

While writing this, I am reminded 

of a time when I used to spend every 
minute of every day fixated on food, 
calculating every calorie, every gram 
of carbs, ultimately telling myself 
what I could and couldn’t eat. All in 
the name of hitting a number on the 
scale, this toxic mentality stole my 
time, happiness and ironically, my 
health. Hours wasted poring over 

online restaurant menus, trying to 
decide what I would order the next 
day when I went out to eat with my 
family. If I couldn’t meticulously pre-
calculate my calories for the meal 
based on grainy images of online 
menus, I would eat a small portion 
of it, feigning fullness. The next day, 
I would heavily restrict my food 
intake to under 900 calories and 
spend countless hours exercising, 
regardless of whether I really had the 
time to or not. Sometimes I would 
make excuses and cancel dinner 
plans altogether. Instead of studying 
for an exam, I would be googling 
things like, “How many calories are 
in toothpaste?”

When the numbers on the scale 

fell, my friends praised me for my 
“willpower” to be healthy. I was 
constantly terrified of losing control, 
but the truth was I already had. I liked 
feeling the gnawing hunger pangs in 
my stomach because I equated it to 
success. The first thing I did every 
morning was rush to the mirror to 
see if my stomach was flatter or my 
thigh gap bigger. What I saw would 
determine my mood, what I would 
be allowed to eat that day or how long 
I would spend on the treadmill that 
night. I thought that tracking every 
single calorie on calorie-counting 
applications and sticking to a strict 
two-hour workout seven days a week 
meant that I was strong. The reality 
was that I was being controlled by diet 
culture, brainwashed into thinking 
that once I hit a certain amount of 
pounds, I would finally love myself 
— that I would finally be happy. 
Growing up, I learned about how the 
media distorted our image of beauty, 
but that didn’t stop me from trying to 
conform to that “perfect” body type. 
It reinforced in me that to be “fat” was 
a fate worse than death.

Diet culture has brainwashed 

many of us into thinking that a 
healthy 
lifestyle 
means 
salads, 

detox smoothies and always telling 
ourselves “no pain, no gain” when 
offered cake at a birthday party. It 
has convinced many of us that eating 
when we feel hungry is a failure 

and that we should instead distract 
ourselves to divert hunger cues and 
chug water to feel full. Our social 
media pages flood with infographics 
about the warrior diet, the egg diet, 
the baby food diet, the cabbage soup 
diet and the list goes on. Not only 
do these weight loss plans often 
contradict each other — the infamous 
IU diet calls for one apple for 
breakfast and two sweet potatoes for 
lunch while the keto diet tells you to 
avoid most fruits, potatoes and high-
carb foods altogether — they are not 
sustainable. Being healthy entails not 
having to obsess over what foods you 
can and cannot eat.

Anyone can be manipulated by 

diet culture. Yet, disordered eating is 
frequently presented as an issue that 
solely affects white women. Research 
has shown that Women of Color in 
the United States are less likely to 
be diagnosed or receive treatment 
for eating disorders. Studies have 
also found that those who identify 
as LGBTQ+ are at a higher risk to 
develop these disorders. Nonbinary 
abolitionist and organizer Da’Shaun 
Harrison voices because they were 
Black, fat and perceived as male, 
doctors refused to acknowledge that 
an eating disorder was possible. They 
write, “Not a single doctor or other 
medical professional that listened 
to me talk about my relationship to 
food and eating considered that I 
might have an eating disorder. In 
fact, when my mom once named ED 
as a possibility to one of the doctors, 
without hesitation, he responded: 
‘That’s not likely, as eating disorders 
aren’t typically seen in boys, especially 
when they are African-American 
and overweight.’” It is important to 
recognize that disordered eating has 
to do with more than just outward 
appearance but also mental health. 
You can’t tell when someone is 
struggling with a single glance. Often, 
diet culture works menacingly in 
the background, slowly poisoning 
our relationships with food and our 
bodies.

Particularly after New Year’s Day, 

diet culture becomes ubiquitous: ads 

for gyms, weight loss programs and 
pills that promise to “burn fat fast” 
appear as an ode to the infamous 
“New Year’s resolution.” Fitness 
influencers upload “How to Get 
that Summer Bikini Body” videos, 
implying that there’s some perfect 
body we should be striving to attain 
and that we are not worthy until we 
do so. Celebrities like the Kardashians 
promote waist trainers, “appetite-
suppressing 
lollipops” 
and 
Flat 

Tummy Tea in spite of being notorious 
for editing their social media photos, 
having access to personal trainers 
and professional nutritionists as well 
as the many speculations of them 
undergoing weight loss surgery and 
other treatments. 

If you’ve ever seen a “What I Eat in a 

Day” video, ask yourself why they are 
always accompanied by thumbnails 
of girls in bikinis and include 
clips of body checking “progress” 
throughout the day, as if aesthetic 
pleasure is the purpose of self-care 
and exercise. Fundamentally, seeing 
a larger number on the scale doesn’t 
mean you aren’t healthy nor does 
seeing a lower number mean you are 
healthy.

“Before and after diet photos” 

can also be problematic. On the left, 
there is a frowning individual. On 
the right, they appear to have lost 
weight and are smiling, seemingly 
much happier overall. These images 
may be motivating to some who want 
to lose weight out of genuine health 
concerns, 
but 
oftentimes, 
these 

comparisons 
portray 
individuals 

as “success stories,” worshiping 
thinness and equating it to happiness. 
But there is no one diet or one exercise 
regime that will give everyone a 
“perfect body.” Trends change and 
what society proclaims is the “perfect 
body” will always change. 150 pounds 
will look different on everybody, and 
no amount of weight loss will solve a 
lack of body appreciation as a result of 
society’s indoctrination of fatphobia. 
Here’s the truth: Even if we all ate and 
exercised the same, our bodies would 
still look vastly different from one 
another’s.

So, the next time your nosy Aunt 

Jenny feels the need to comment 
on how many potatoes are on your 
Christmas plate, remember that like 
our personalities, our bodies are all 
different and need different things in 
order to function. We will have less 
energy to work out sometimes, and 
we might feel hungrier some days 
and we don’t need to justify that to 
ourselves or anybody else. Our bodies 
are smart; we should listen to them. 
Eat more vegetables and fruits for 
physical health, and don’t forget the 
ice cream and potato chips for mental 
health too.

Diet culture is everywhere, but so 

is body positivity — if we know where 
to look for it. Despite the clickbait-y 
video titles and thumbnails, Linda 
Sun’s Youtube channel was one place 
that never failed to remind me that 
what made me special had nothing to 
do with what I looked like. Likewise, 
Victoria Myers’s Instagram account 
encourages intuitive eating and 
teaches us how to navigate a world 
obsessed with diet talk. Actresses 
Lana Condor and Gabourey Sidibe 
remind us that no matter how 
perfect someone’s life seems on 
the surface, body image issues are 
so much more common than we 
realize and that ultimately, we are 
not alone in our struggles. Model 
Ashley Graham pushes back at people 
who call her “brave” for posting her 
un-photoshopped bikini pictures. 
Catherine Pawley’s TED Talk, “Life’s 
too short to weigh your cornflakes,” 
reminds us how joyful life can be if 
we silence the poisonous voice in our 
heads that tells us we need to engage 
in destructive behaviors in order to 
feel safe and in control.

A slice of birthday cake is not a 

shameful 370 calories or 32 grams of 
carbs or 22 grams of sugar. That slice 
of cake is more than just numbers. 
That slice of cake is laughter with 
family, 
unforgettable 
memories 

with friends and happiness for the 
tastebuds. We must deconstruct and 
reconstruct our relationships with 
our food and our bodies and embrace 
that our bodies change over time.

“How many would you like?”

“Please fill this out with your date

bottom with today’s date.”

“Má phai ốdienố vô ngày sinh, ốốdia

may.” 

This is how a lot of shopping trips, 

doctors visits and phone calls go for 
my family. Someone asks my parents 
something. My sister or I translate 
it. My parents respond to us. We 
translate back. 

And I hated doing this. Like, hated 

it. It was embarrassing for 10-year-old 
me. I felt like a burden to the workers 
and thought I was slowing everything 
down. So every time my mom told me 
to order food over the phone, I’d feign 
busyness just so I wouldn’t have to. 
She’d tell me to sit with her while she’s 
on the phone with the doctor’s office, 
and I would grumble and sigh.

I’ve always been proud to have 

grown up in a bilingual environment, 
being immersed in two languages 
that come naturally to me. And I knew 
that it made my parents proud too, 
especially when other Vietnamese 
parents 
would 
compliment 
me 

and my sister’s seemingly native 
Vietnamese fluency. Adults would ask 
us if we were born in Vietnam, and I 
knew my parents were beaming with 
pride behind their humble smiles.

I liked talking to my parents in 

Vietnamese when we were out and 
about because it made me feel like 
we were telling a secret no one else 
would hear, but not when someone 
was waiting on the other end for a 
response. I dreaded the deafening 
silence of someone standing and 
anticipating a response as I translated 
what they said to my parents, 
waited for my parents’ response 
and formulated their words back to 
English. 

Thinking about it now, I can’t 

pinpoint an exact reason for having 
felt that way. Was it because I was 
afraid someone was going to mock 
me as some kids did in elementary 
school? Or was it because I had yet to 
understand how my translations gave 
my parents a sense of security?

When I asked her why she would 

have us translate, my mom told me 
that it made everything easier, but 
she emphasized how it made her 
more comfortable. She feared people 
would assume our family was “fresh 
off the boat,” as people say, and hated 
the feeling of asking employees to 
slow down their speaking. Her past 

experiences taught her to expect that 
these “inconveniences” would be 
met with impatience and rudeness. 
Having my sister and I speak up would 
signal to people that we know just as 
much English as any other American, 
though that should not determine 
whether or not we are treated with 
respect. 

As I got older, I learned more and 

more about my parents’ immigrant 
stories. For years, my mom sat in her 
evening ESL class after tirelessly 
working multiple jobs during the day, 
trying to perfect her “th” sounds and 
the “r” in words like “earth” (which 
still require my gentle guidance). My 
dad failed many writing assignments 
because he could never fully express in 
his writing what he wanted to say. He 
can still picture himself sitting in the 
library studying until midnight while 
his classmates played football outside, 
solely because he couldn’t understand 
what he was reading. Once I put 
myself in my parents’ shoes, I began 
to understand their immigration 
experience with broken English and 
their constant “uh”s, “um”s, and “oh, 
never mind”s when talking to English 
speakers. The “Where I go?” instead 
of “Where do I go,” or the “Look nice” 
instead of “That looks nice.” They 
were foreigners doing their best with 
the English they knew, but what they 
didn’t know created another challenge 
for surviving in the United States.

I’ve learned the best I can do is help 

ease any burden my parents may feel. 
Now, I embrace translating for my 
parents by taking initiative with small 
gestures I know they appreciate, even 
if they don’t voice it. I call the doctor’s 
office instead of just sitting there 
and only interjecting when I have 
to. I order the food without my mom 
asking. I see my dad having difficulty 
explaining what he’s looking for and 
jump in for him instead. 

I think speaking Vietnamese has 

done more for me than simply helping 
me communicate. It has allowed 
me to understand and value things 
my parents keep close to them. My 
mom radiates happiness when she 
sees me reading her cookbook filled 
with scrawls and scribbles from her 
attempts to perfect each recipe. My 
dad sits back with a nostalgic look on 
his face as I read notes he used to write 
for my mom when they were dating. 
Without a language barrier, my sister 
and I are able to stay in touch with my 
grandma and older relatives.

It’s as if we have become our 

parents’ 
own 
personal 
Google 

Translate, and that’s not such a bad 
thing. 

I love you.

YOUR WEEKLY

ARIES

It’s a very intelligent, thought-driven 
week for you, Aries. Venus’ arrival in 
your values zone sets you thinking 
about what truly matters to you – and 
you may discover that you have more 

to be grateful for than you 
realized.

AQUARIUS

GEMINI

When Venus moves into your 
spiritual zone on Wednesday, Gemini, 
you’ll crave some peace and solitude, 
so don’t be surprised if you feel less 
sociable than normal. It’s fine to take 
some time out or to turn down 

invitations – even 
Geminis are allowed some 
quiet time!

SAGITTARIUS

CAPRICORN

SCORPIO

CANCER

With Venus arriving in your social 
zone on Wednesday, Cancer, it goes 
without saying that you’ll feel open, 
friendly and keen to mix with people 
for much of this week.

TAURUS

The arrival of Venus in your sign on 
Wednesday boosts your charm and 
your social skills to no end, making 
this a very good week for finding new 
friendships. In love too, this influence 

attracts lots of attention – 
you are an emotional 
open book at the moment, 
but this can make you feel 

vulnerable when dating.

VIRGO

PISCES

LIBRA
LEO

Venus shifts into your status zone on 
Wednesday, which is an interesting 
placement – on the one hand, it 
makes it easier for you to charm your 
way ahead at work, but on the other, 

it does create quite a 
snobbish vibe around you.

Read your weekly horoscopes from astrology.tv

Venus’ arrival in your travel zone on 
Wednesday opens up all kinds of 
lovely possibilities – including a 
potential romance while on vacation, 
if you’re single. Take up any 

educational opportunity 

this week too, as this is 
another avenue for 
potential love.

Venus shifts into your intimacy zone 
this week, so you’ll want lots of privacy 
with your special someone for sure.
This is helpful, because later in the 
week, your relationship may come 

under extreme pressure. 

Focus on your love life this week. With 
Venus moving into your love zone on 
Wednesday, it will probably be difficult 
for you to think about anything else! 
This is a deeply sensual and emotional 

vibe, which touches your very 

soul.

Relationships with colleagues get a 
boost this week as Venus arrives in 
your everyday work zone. This area of 
your chart also refers to your health, 
Sagittarius, so a calming, soothing 

vibe should do wonders for 

your stress levels.

This should be a feel-good week for 
sure. With Venus moving into your joy 
zone on Wednesday, it’s time to enjoy 
yourself. Make a deliberate effort to 
do more – much more – of whatever 

makes you smile the most.

Family matters get a real boost from 
the arrival of Venus in your home zone 
on Wednesday. Difficult relatives 
become easier to deal with, and peace 
– of sorts – descends upon the family. 
Enjoy it while it lasts!

This is a very good week for opening 
up to other people and sharing your 
feelings. With Venus moving into your 
communication zone on Wednesday, 
that should become easier. If you’ve 
had any kind of talking therapy 

recently, this week should 
start to show results.

have 

requested their names remain 
private, along with another victim 
left wounded. Cherokee County 
Sheriff’s Capt. Jay Baker, who 
has previously expressed anti-
Asian and generally racist beliefs 
on social media, justified the 
attack, asserting it was simply “… 
a bad day for (the suspect).” This 
refusal to attribute the attack’s 
nature to its true origins in anti-
Asian racism, white supremacy 
and oppression is a reflection of 
our governing institutions’ denial 
of these aforementioned systems 
permeating 
through 
the 
very 

foundation of our country.

Xiaojie Tan, 49, was a massage 

therapist 
and 
the 
owner 
of 

two local Georgia businesses, 
including 
Young’s 
Asian 
Spa. 

Her ex-husband, Michael Webb, 

remarks that “she was full of 
smiles and laughter. She was just a 
pleasure to be around.” She would 
have turned 50 on March 17, one 
day after her death.

Hyun 
Jung 
Grant 
(maiden 

name: Kim) was a single mother 
who dedicated herself to her two 
sons. She worked relentlessly at 
Gold Spa. Hyun Jung’s favourite 
dish to make was kimchi jjigae, and 
she loved spending time with her 
sons at the aquarium. 

After Yong Ae Yu was laid off 

due to the pandemic, she worked 
as a licensed massage therapist 
at Aromatherapy Bar. Yong Ae 
moved to the United States from 
South Korea in the 1970s and was 
the mother of two sons. She was a 
great cook and a fan of noraebang, 
Korean karaoke.

Delaina Ashley Yaun, 33, was on 

a date at Young’s Asian Massage 
with her husband, Mario Gonzalez, 
for a couples’ massage. A server and 
grill operator at the Waffle House, 
Yaun often shared eggs and grits 
with homeless people during her 
early morning shifts, and a friend 
described a “light around her” that 
drew people in.

Paul Andre Michels, 54, was 

working on maintenance and 
hardware for Young’s Asian Spa. 
Kikiana Whidby, the mother of 
Michels’ godson, reflected on his 
kindness in an interview with CBS 
News. Michels was a Detroit native 
and his brother, John Michels, 
remarked that he was considering 
opening his own massage business.

Three other lives were lost, 

and one man was wounded. Their 
families 
have 
requested 
that 

their privacy is honored beyond 
these facts. Here are the correct 
pronunciations for the names of 
Hyun Jung Grant, Yong Ae Yue 
and Xiaojie Tan. Please honor their 
lives and legacies with this in mind. 

Between March 19, 2020 and 

February 28, 2021 alone, Stop 
AAPI Hate has recorded 3,974 
firsthand accounts of anti-Asian 
violence in 47 states and the 
District of Columbia. According 
to the report, Asian women 
are 2.3 times more likely to be 
assaulted compared to Asian men. 
It is important to note that low-
income Asian women in service 
industries are particularly at risk 
to these attacks, demonstrating the 
intersectionality between gender 
and class in rising anti-Asian 
violence. While the form of attack 
ranges from spitting to verbal or 
even physical harassment, the 
majority of assaulters targeted 
violent attacks to one of the 
most vulnerable within Asian 
communities in the U.S.: elders. 
Despite this data, it is impossible to 
measure the severity of anti-Asian 
sentiment, as incidents frequently 
go 
unreported 
within 
Asian 

communities in the U.S.

Among these attacks, on Jan. 28, 

Vicha Ratanapakdee, an 84-year-
old Thai American man, was 
pushed to the ground and killed 
while taking a morning stroll in his 
San Francisco neighborhood. On 
March 19, Xiaozhen Xie, 76, was 
punched in the eye in downtown 

San Francisco before crossing 
the street. Though she was able 
to valiantly defend herself with a 
wooden stick, her family reported 
that Xiao was “very traumatized” 
and became scared to leave her 
home. After her grandson raised 
almost $1 million for medical 
expenses through her GoFundMe, 
Xie decided to donate all of the 
funds towards supporting Asian 
American communities to combat 
the 
deeply-rooted 
anti-Asian 

racism present in society at large. 

In response to this violence, 

police departments nationwide 
have increased police presence 
in 
areas 
with 
high 
Asian 

populations. 
However, 
experts 

have 
discovered 
that 
more 

policing 
does 
not 
necessarily 

lower crime rates. Instead, the vast 
history of abuse toward the most 
vulnerable members of the Asian 
community — including those 
with undocumented immigration 
status, 
mental 
health 
issues, 

women and migrant sex workers 
— has instilled a legitimate fear 
of law enforcement, exacerbated 
by 
the 
possible 
difficulty 
of 

overwhelming language barriers 
and cultural stigma. 

For 
Asian 
and 
otherwise 

marginalized peoples, the police 
prove to be a deadly force. In 
December 2020 alone, two Asian-
American men suffering mental 
health crises were murdered by the 
police. Pennsylvania State Police 
fatally shot Christian Hall, 19, while 
his hands were raised. Angelo 
Quinto, 30, died after an officer 

pressed his knee on his neck for 
over eight minutes. Additionally, 
police presence has specifically 
targeted Asian massage parlors, 
including two of the three targeted 
in the Atlanta shooting, which has 
proven detrimental. Yang Song, a 
38-year-old Chinese woman and 
employee at a Queens massage 
parlor, was sexually assaulted 
by a man that claimed to be an 
undercover cop. In 2017, Song 
died after falling four stories from 
her apartment during a New York 
Police Department raid while 
officers were attempting to arrest 
her for engaging in sex work. The 
argument that the police officers 
were simply doing their jobs only 
exposes a larger systemic issue of 
the inherent corruption and harm 
of law enforcement, as well as the 
violence of criminalizing sex work. 
These cases prove that the police 
are 
oppressive, 
masquerading 

as protectors while continuing 
to perpetuate the harm they 
pretend to subvert, placing Asian 
communities in further danger 
under the guise of protection.

The misconception that violence 

and hate perpetrated against 
Asian Americans is new, or has 
only surfaced amid the pandemic, 
is far from true. Racialized fear 
mongering and hatred against 
Asian Americans has existed 
for hundreds of years. The 1871 
Chinese Massacre — where a mob 
of white men tortured and killed 
19 Chinese immigrants — is one of 
countless examples in history of 
senseless violence towards Asians 

in the U.S. However, this violence 
is far more inherent to American 
society than civilian attacks, as 
it has been rooted in political 
schemes to colonize and exclude 
Asian populations globally. The 
first anti-Asian legislation passed 
was the Page Act of 1875. This 
law 
banned 
Chinese 
women 

from entering the country, due 
to a negative stereotype that 
these women were sex workers 
riddled with diseases, a seed of 
fetishization of Asian women that 
still can be seen today in much of 
mainstream media representation. 
In 1882, the Chinese Exclusion Act 
was passed — the first and only 
major act of legislation barring 
immigration from a specific nation 
— banning the immigration of 
Chinese immigrants and barring 
Chinese Americans already in 
the country from naturalizing. 
Its impact is an indelible mark 
on U.S. history, preventing Asian 
immigrants and their children 
born in the U.S. from becoming 
citizens (and thus from voting) 
until 1943. During World War II, 
over 110,000 Japanese Americans, 
including over 66,000 U.S. citizens, 
were forcibly incarcerated in 
subhuman conditions for years. 
Its devastating impact is grossly 
neglected in history as roughly 
1,862 Japanese Americans died 
of disease in these camps, and 
every prisoner lost their livelihood 
during their internment.

On The Enduring Legacy of Dr. Amy Chang

Four 
lab 
benches 
constitute 

the Chang Lab in the Molecular, 
Cellular and Developmental Biology 
Department at the University of 
Michigan, and Dr. Amy Chang — 
or Amy, as she prefers to be called 
— knows every single crevice and 
corner of them in the same sort of 
comforting familiarity that comes 
with knowing one’s home. Amy can 
often be found bustling around her 
lab long after the sun has set, tending 
to her painstakingly cultivated yeast 
cells, a gel waiting to be run, a fussy 
serological pipette, while maybe 
reading a New Yorker cartoon or 
that week’s issue of The Washington 
Post in slivers of downtime. More 

importantly, these lab benches are 
Amy’s ultimate domain, and she 
gives every single one of them a 
kind of remarkably unrestricted 
love not always seen within the 
rigid confines of scientific academia. 
Watching Amy work is like watching 
a seasoned artist in action; she flits 
from one task to the next with a 
methodical tenacity, all while telling 
me about the new crockpot she 
bought, her beloved son Tim or how 
joining a sport is one of the most 
important things a scientist can do, 
because it teaches you how to win 
and lose. Her workspace is strewn 
with bottles of buffers and growth 
mediums, tubes of cells, scrawled 
dates and a stopwatch on constant 
detail, and mostly a kind of beautiful 
unorganized chaos that no one but 
Amy has seemed to grasp an innate 

understanding of.

To inherently make sense of the 

complexities of Amy’s lab and her 
life’s work, it’s important to start 
with Amy first. After all, a lab is an 
extension of the scientists operating 
it. Amy, a New York native, graduated 
from Harvard University with a 
degree in biochemistry, received 
her doctorate in cell biology from 
Yale 
University 
and 
completed 

her postgraduate training at both 
Yale University and the Whitehead 
Institute 
at 
the 
Massachusetts 

Institute 
of 
Technology. 
After 

sitting down with her last week, I 
also learned she was a fan of “Pride 
and Prejudice” and found a Buddha 
statue at a long-closed consignment 
shop that she still thinks about often 
when approaching her research. 
Amy’s foray into science began 

with a long commute from Queens, 
N.Y., to The Bronx High School of 
Science and was heavily influenced 
by her scientist father, who nudged 
her from the ground up to pursue a 
career centered around the pursuit of 
scientific discovery. Ultimately, Amy 
told me that what she loves about her 
job lies in something much deeper 
than the coursework she had pursued 
at the Bronx High School of Science, 
Harvard, Yale or M.I.T. Rather, it 
lies in the highly intimate, physical 
and voracious nature of her work. 
You see, research is invigorating, 
groundbreaking, 
dynamic 
and 

ever-changing; more importantly, it 
seems research is a career path that 
works in perfect tandem with Amy’s 
committed, 
hands-on, 
intuitive 

approach to life. Because Amy just 
seems to know when her yeast cells 

are in need, when the culture she 
grew them on lacks just the right 
amount of glucose or leucine or when 
their time in the incubator is up, even 
without the guiding hand of a clock.

Amy is a daughter of immigrants 

and the only woman of color on 
faculty in her department. And 
being a scientist at one of the 
biggest, highest funded research 
powerhouses in the country — the 
University of Michigan — comes 
with its own unique set of challenges. 
Scientific discovery is cutthroat, 
in that dutifully researching the 
same metabolic pathway out of 
love for years is simply not enough. 
Competition is stiff, and studying 
that metabolic pathway requires 
money, space and ultimately power. 
According to Amy, “you feel a lot of 
elbows” on your way to the top. In 

likening research to the principles 
of business, Amy said, “you have 
to sell yourself” — a practice of 
which Amy is a veteran. Her work 
has completely redefined the way 
academia 
views 
endoplasmic 

reticulum stress response as well 
as mechanisms of protein folding 
capacity. And ultimately, her findings 
are trailblazing, profound and very 
much reminiscent of Amy. 

Though young Amy had other 

ambitions too: her dreams consisted 
of one day being a violinist, and she 
has a soft spot for studio art. In our 
conversation, she lamented about 
what could’ve been had she carried 
out those aspirations instead. But I’d 
like to counter that Amy is an artist 
in her own right, because the work 
she does every day is art, in its own 
unique, pioneering, Amy-esque way.

A journey through

my journal

A lunch date on September 2, 

2019. A class skipped on January 
21, 2020. A Zoom meeting on 
February 17, 2021. 

Years and years, days upon 

days of experiences compressed 
into several bullet points on a 
notes application. Ever since 
I was young, I’ve found solace 
in 
journaling. 
During 
my 

early years of high school, a 
particularly troubled time in 
my life, I recall drowning in the 
judgments of others, allowing 
the 
discriminatory 
attitudes 

of other people to affect my 
own identity — to control my 
narrative. Back then, I relied on 
the act of expressive writing to 
help me take back that narrative 
and rewrite my own story in 
a way that was constructive, 
truthful and looked at the whole 
picture. Fast forward to today, 
deep into an ongoing global 
pandemic with no discernible 
end in sight, the continued act 
of journaling has sustained me 
throughout 
these 
especially 

uncertain times.

But what is it about this mere 

act of what Jose´ van Dijck 
would describe as “writing the 
self as mediated memory” that 
gives way to such productive 
potential? Evidently, the health 
benefits of expressive writing are 
extensive. Van Dijck claims that 
autobiographical writing allows 
us 
to 
construct 
“continuity 

between past and present while 
keeping an eye on the future.” 
In other words, we write so we 
remember, and by remembering 
we allow ourselves to realize 
and keep in touch with our true 
nature. In a study by Daniel 

L. Schacter and five others on 
“The Future of Memory,” his 
group’s findings suggest that a 
link between “remembering the 
past and imagining the future” 
allows us to simulate future 
events with greater specificity 
and improves our ability to 
emotionally 
regulate. 
When 

we have an accurate account 
of our past experiences — what 
we’ve done, who we’ve seen, 
where we’ve been — we’re able 
to better imagine what our 
anticipating circumstances will 
be, even in the face of adversity 
and uncertainty. The sheer act 
of writing in a journal reinforces 
our thought patterns allowing 
us to develop healthier coping 
mechanisms.

I’ve personally experienced 

this myself. Journaling over 
the years has gradually helped 
me understand my perspectives 
towards life and the subtle ways 
they shift over time. It’s helped 
me recognize my values, my 
attitudes and my beliefs frozen 
in the context of time and place, 
and prevented me from falling 
victim to hindsight bias. I look 
back on past experiences, good 
and bad, and am able to accept 
what happened for what it was 
holistically. Sometimes we feel 
compelled to lie to ourselves, to 
forget or deny events and actions 
in our pasts in order to feel 
better about who we are in the 
present. I strive to subvert this 
by cherishing even struggles, 
and looking for what I can learn 
in the pain, since it is often 
our suffering that takes us to 
where we need to be by forcing 
us to become better and make 
progress.

My own crown

Even more than before, the 

pandemic has resulted in social 
media being a creative outlet, a way 
to pick up new talents or a place to 
experiment in hobbies you have 
never tried before. I tried to pick up 
new techniques when styling my 
type 4 coily hair, a thick hair texture 
that consists of tight curls or spring-
like coils. Representation of hair 
and hair products have increased 
over the years, such as on Pinterest 
where a color spectrum was added, 
which included hair and skin, to 
ease hair and fashion searches. 
However, bigger loose curls known 
as type 2 and 3 are represented more 
than coily hair in the media, making 
it hard for Black women to find 
products to assist in their natural 
hair journey. This issue is only the 
tip of the iceberg of struggles within 
the hair industry. Media has taught 
Black women for years that to be 
beautiful, you must straighten your 
hair, get a perm or have looser curls. 

There is miseducation around 

type 4 hair: It cannot grow, it’s not 
“good” hair and it’s nappy. Those 
statements are not true and only 
degrade and make it increasingly 
difficult to be confident with one’s 

natural hair, as natural hair is met 
with judgement and otherwise 
negative connotations. I remember 
being in middle school and everyone 
was obsessed with having the 
straightest hair possible or getting 
relaxers. If their fingers got stuck 
once, it was considered nappy. There 
was, and still is, an obsession with 
having the straightest, shiniest hair 
instead of embracing the magic 
our hair encompasses. I never got a 
relaxer, which at the time seemed 
like a burden, but I am forever 
grateful to my mom, who wanted 
me to appreciate myself. Even other 
Black girls would run their fingers 
through another girl’s hair, an 
infamous “don’t do.” The COVID-19 
pandemic gave women with coily 
hair an amazing opportunity to fully 
express themselves by advertising 
more styles and hair products on 
social media, resulting in type 4 
hair being regarded as beautiful. 
However, regardless of if the media 
loves my hair, I have taught myself 
to love all of me without societal 
validation. All curls are beautiful no 
matter if one type is easier to style or 
more desirable, because our crowns 
are uniquely beautiful. After all, 
they were made for us.

I had to learn to love my hair 

regardless of whether it was long, 
short, super curly or straight — a 

lesson many young Black girls will 
have to face as they continue on 
their hair journey. As poet Alyestal 
once spoke, “My skin absorbs the 
sun’s rays and my hair defies gravity. 
You can’t tell me I’m not magic.” Our 
hair, no matter the texture, is magic. 
The world may not give curly hair 
the love it deserves, but it is not our 
emotional burden to continuously 
teach others not to touch our hair 
or defend the realism of our locks. 
Many of us can’t fully understand 
how our hair reacts, but we must 
lift each other up by not judging 
others on how they decide to wear 
their hair. History has taught us 
to manipulate our hair, but it has 
always been in our power to braid 
it, lock it or even straighten it. May 
we all cherish the power that comes 
from the crowns on our heads no 
matter our curl pattern. May we 
cherish our curls as a way to show 
self-love. When we aren’t able to 
express ourselves through our 
words, our hair often speaks for us, 
whether it’s saying we just woke up, 
that we haven’t touched it in way 
too long or that we’ve put hours of 
care into our hair as a commitment 
to ourselves. It’s time we learn to 
appreciate and love everything that 
our hair is, type 4 or not. Never tell 
another queen how to change her 
crown, only how to uplift it.

Finding community and healing

Chairs and X-marks drawn 

in chalk stood six feet apart. 
Small, 
battery-operated 
tea 

lights flickered in the dwindling 
light. As I listened to the vigil’s 
speakers discuss racism, violence 
and healing, I felt overcome with 
emotion. Unexpectedly — and 
more than once — I grew misty-
eyed, not from the cold wind that 
numbed my fingertips, but from 
the strong sense of community 
amidst 
such 
tragedy 
— 
a 

community that seemed to say 
“you are not alone.”

By vigil, I’m referring to the 

event on March 27 hosted on 
the steps of Angell Hall by the 
University of Michigan’s United 
Asian American Organizations, 
a coalition of more than 23 Asian-
American student groups on 
campus. The vigil provided the 
U-M community with a way to 
grieve the lives lost in Georgia 
and simultaneously stand in 
solidarity against anti-Asian hate.

Throughout the vigil, thoughts 

reeled in my head in a dizzying 
fashion. I thought back to 
my middle school years, 
during 
which 
jokes 

and absurd questions 
accompanied 
my 

identity as the only 
Asian 
American 

in 
my 
grade. 

Simultaneously, 
I struggled with 
feeling inauthentic 
as 
an 
Asian 

American 
during 

those years. I ate 
grilled cheese, ice cream 
and french fries more often 
than pancit, chicken adobo or 
steamed stuffed buns. I carried 
my mother’s East Asian eyes, but 
I didn’t speak her native tongue, 
which meant being separated 
by what felt like a million miles 
during 
get-togethers 
with 

Filipino friends and family. When 
I visited my mother’s hometown 
in the Philippines, I was too 
white and too American; yet, in 
my own hometown, I was too 
foreign and too Asian. At a young 

age, I learned that being caught in 
between two worlds usually meant 
never being fully embraced by either 
one.

Such 
self-awareness, 
if 
you 

could call it that, led me to wonder 
what it meant to be a “hyphenated 
American,” as University alum 
Dim Mang said during the vigil. 
Loosely attempting to assimilate 
or adapt to situations — whether 
in the Philippines or the U.S. — at 
the expense of my mixed Asian-
American identity led to a disconnect 
with who I was, generating conflict 
between my own needs, feelings 
and realities. I began to desire a 
discernment of who I was within 
the Asian-American community, a 
community full of rich histories and 
cultures I didn’t entirely understand 
but was inexplicably linked to. In 
high school, I started to read about 
parts of Asian-American history no 
teacher had ever taught me — such 
as the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 
— in hopes of better understanding 
where I belonged in my own country. 
Then, in college, amidst rhetoric 
of the “Chinese virus” and “Kung 

Flu” from 
government leaders, I witnessed the 
consequences of letting such history 
go ignored.

Standing in front of Angell Hall 

amidst people who shared some 
of these conflictions, I considered 
how so much had changed since 
my middle school days, and yet 
nothing had changed. What was 

unchecked violence in the form 
of “othering” on the playground 
had 
manifested 
into 
targeted 

violence rooted in hate and racism. 
Then again, such violence has 
always been there. Discriminatory 
attitudes surrounding around Asian 
Americans were real then and 
remain real now. 

All my life, I’ve struggled with 

finding a sense of belonging. It took 
time to find my place in the Asian-
American community, and my 
heart pangs for the damage we have 
been dealt. Each day, I read about 
the torrent of racist violence and 
feel grief for the Asians and Asian 
Americans harmed — whether 
physically, mentally or emotionally — 
and left to cope with the devastation 
of years of systemic racism and 
other issues across the country. 
The need for a vigil represents lives 
that should never have been lost, 
the lack of security and support 
we feel in our communities and a 
reality of violence and hatred we 
shouldn’t have to bear witness to 
and experience ourselves.

There is another message I 

received from the vigil, however: 
one of solidarity and healing. 
The rise of targeted violence and 

racism related to perceived 

associations with COVID-19 

drive home the importance 

of promoting space and 
healing. In so many 
ways, we have been 
living in tumultuous 
times for over a year. 
Our normal coping 
mechanisms — loved 
ones, hobbies, social 
activities — have been 
altered if not completely 
stripped away, leaving us 

with limited ways to cope 

healthily through each day. 
Throughout these challenges, 

it’s difficult to find ways to 

practice radical self-care, let alone 
feel joy, peace and wholeness. But 
it is damaging to not take care 
of oneself, just as it is unfair to 
individually shoulder the burden of 
dealing with the consequences of 
broader circumstances and social 
structures.

The essentiality of anti-capitalist self-care

Growing up as a first-generation 

Korean American in the Korean 
church, I was taught to think of 
others first: take care of the younger 
ones in our community, be on 
standby to help my parents whenever 
needed, don’t start eating until the 
eldest at the table takes the first 
bite. In my family, love was often, 
and almost always, sacrificial. And 
while I am incredibly grateful for 
my background and recognize the 
character and values it has instilled 
in me, I think it also gradually 
conditioned 
me 
to 
disregard 

myself and my own needs. I quietly 
taught myself I never needed to 
be at the center. Seeking help was 
unnecessary, self-indulgence was 
never the answer and the extent of 
my daily productivity was a measure 
of my internal strength. I grew up 
never allowing myself to be “that 
person” who needed to take a day off 
at work or gratify their whims, and 
I remember thinking as a child that 
the last thing I should even do was 
ask my mom to buy me a candy bar 
or some other trinket displayed on 
the sides of the cashier line.

So when the term “self-care” 

resurfaced in popular media several 
years ago, I naturally scoffed and 
brushed it aside as just a trend for 
the privileged — those who could 
afford to splurge on Lush bath 

bombs, essential oil diffusers or 
ten-step skincare routines. In my 
mind, self-care was just another 
way for rich people to make excuses 
for themselves, and to be honest, I 
regarded it as an activity only white 
people participated in because I had 
only seen it as such. But especially 
after 
attending 
the 
teach-in 

hosted by United Asian American 
Organizations (UAAO) for Asian 
American and Pacific Islander 
Heritage Month on March 31 about 
burnout and anti-capitalist self-
care, I have come to understand that 
self-care is not for the privileged but, 
in fact, for all — and it is especially 
for the marginalized, for those who 
cannot afford to think twice about 
their self-preservation. 

As 
explained 
in 
UAAO’s 

presentation, 
though 
self-care 

has been commodified into a ten-
million dollar industry by U.S. 
capitalism, the origins of self-care 
actually stem from anti-capitalist 
roots in the Black Power movement 
of the 1960s and 70s. The Black 
Panther Party championed this idea 
during the Civil Rights Movement, 
with legendary leaders Angela 
Davis and Ericka Huggins utilizing 
mindfulness techniques like yoga 
and meditation while in prison. For 
these organizers, often Black queer 
women, the idea of maintaining 
their health and preserving their 
existence was not only a means 
of survival but an act of political 
warfare. 

Self-care 
quickly 
became 

community care, a term illustrated 
by Deanna Zandt that describes 
larger methods of maintaining 
the health and safety of one’s 
community 
and 
collectively 

resisting the oppressive nature 
of our capitalist society. In 1972, 
the Black Community Survival 
Conference held in Oakland, Ca. 
provided resources about the Party’s 
free community-service programs, 
such as healthcare clinics, local 
transportation and free breakfast 
programs that became a means of 
survival and support against the 
harassment and violence inflicted 
upon Black people by the police and 
federal government. In a white-
dominated, capitalist society where 
leaders, institutions and systems 
failed to protect and fulfill their 
needs, active self-care translated 
to caring for one’s community in a 
way that would ultimately lead to 
structural change. 

While I used to roll my eyes at the 

phrase “self-care” and only throw 
the term around lightly, I realized 
the weight of what true self-care 
for me meant when I could no 
longer afford to dismiss it— when I 
physically could not breathe under 
the immeasurable distress caused 
by the reality of our society. When I 
heard about the Atlanta shootings on 
March 16, I needed to stop whatever 
I was working on and do something, 
anything, that would offer me some 
semblance of solace and healing. 

That night, my roommates and I had 
a long discussion about the news 
and talked for several hours. All of 
us were at a loss of words and still 
processing what had happened, and 
I think we all knew we needed to 
simply be together in that space. 

In 
the 
days 
following 
the 

shooting, as more news sources 
started revealing the names of 
the victims and social media 
exploded with threads of who and 
what was responsible and which 
organizations to support, the weight 
of what had happened continued to 
steadily creep into my being. I had 
an online interview for a summer 
internship scheduled two days 
after the event, and I remember 
the coordinator reaching out to the 
applicants the morning of March 17 
to give us the option to reschedule 
in case we were not in the right 
headspace for an interview. While I 
genuinely appreciated the email and 
recognized that it would be helpful 
for many, I told her I was fine. I 
could handle it, I thought to myself. 
There was no need for the hassle of 
altering this other person’s schedule 
for my own convenience. 

The night of, I reserved a study 

space on campus to get some work 
done and practice for my interview 
a few hours before its scheduled 
time. After I had rehearsed a few 
times with a little over an hour or 
so left until my time slot, one of my 
friends texted me about a vigil held 
by Red Canary Song, a grassroots 
organization of Asian and migrant 
sex workers based in New York 
City. I decided to join the livestream 
for as long as I could before my 
interview. In the vigil, activists, 
students and massage workers 
spoke 
against 
the 
anti-Asian 

violence that had occurred and the 
larger intersectional issues that the 
incident was borne from. In the last 
segment I saw, Yuh-line Niou from 
the New York State Assembly wept 
as she spoke about her mothers, 
sisters and aunties that could have 
filled those names. 

And then I started bawling. 

There I was, uncontrollably shaking 
and sobbing in that empty room, ten 
minutes before my interview. I can’t 
remember many times in my life 
that I have felt this level of emotion 
and grief — it completely seized me. 
I took a few deep breaths and slowly 

proceeded with the interview, and 
I was fortunately able to carry an 
honest and genuine conversation 
with the interviewer, a fellow Asian 
woman who told me she had been 
grieving as well. After I got home 
that night, I quickly went to my 
room and wrote down everything I 
could remember from how I had felt 
during the vigil and past several days. 
I listed the names of the victims, 
which I will not share here as not 
all families have consented for these 
names to be publicly circulated. I 
wrote about the wave of grief and 
sorrow I had felt, thinking about 
the unimaginable pain endured by 
the victims’ families every waking 
second. I wrote about the genuine 
fear I felt for my own mother and 
other Asian women in my life — how 
these victims could be my middle-
aged neighbor, my family friend who 
has recently become a parent, even 
the three-year-old girl I babysat last 
summer. 

I am not saying that I should 

have rescheduled my interview 
or that there was, or is, always a 
correct route to making one choice 
or the other. But what I am saying 
is that grief is real and self-care 
is absolutely essential. Through 
having 
conversations 
with 
my 

roommates, journaling my feelings 
and prioritizing my mental health 
in the days and weeks following, 
self-care was more than merely 
a beneficial leisure activity — it 
became 
something 
that 
was 

demanded from my body and mind. 
And I have since understood that 
the discipline of preserving myself 
and my well-being is something 
that I, as an Asian woman, need to 
actively and consciously practice — 
if not solely for my well-being, then 
for the sake of resisting the white-
dominated patriarchy that we live 
in.

On March 26, UAAO held a vigil 

— in person and via livestream — 
for the victims of this anti-Asian 
violence, and I played a small role 
in helping organize it. On the steps 
of Angell Hall, we shared a moment 
of silence to honor the victims and 
had numerous student organizers 
and 
other 
activists 
from 
the 

community speak about issues such 
as the destigmatization of sex work 
and the need for global solidarity. 
We lit over two hundred candles, 

listened to several resonant poems 
of Carlina Duan’s and closed out the 
night with a poignant performance 
of Bob Dylan’s “Blowin’ in the 
Wind” by two students. At our 
final debriefing meeting after the 
event, our check-in question was 
to simply share about how the vigil 
was for us and how we were feeling 
in its aftermath. I watched as, one by 
one, every person in the room spoke 
about how planning and attending 
the vigil had brought them a sense of 
peace and healing, almost catharsis.

In light of the rise of anti-Asian 

hate crimes this past year and the 
devastation of the eight lives taken in 
Atlanta, I, and countless others, have 
grieved. We have taken the time to 
drop what we were doing, take care 
of ourselves and simply, breathe. 
And in that same breath, we have 
checked in on our loved ones and 
processed through our emotions as 
a collective, deciding how to move 
forward and organizing community-
based efforts to counteract this 
violence and its predacious systems. 
And it is in these moments that 
I realize that true self-care and 
community care often go hand in 
hand, necessitating one another out 
of shared love and solidarity. When 
an entire community is confronted 
with an enormity of grief and faces 
even the daily manifestations of our 
oppressive society, we recognize 
that we must try to take care of 
ourselves, as an individual and 
inherently as a community. 

In a typical week, self-care for 

me looks like intentionally setting 
aside time to maintain my mental 
health, whether I feel like I need it 
at the moment or not. It looks like 
journaling, reading a poem (or two) 
before bed or simply making myself 
a cup of tea to start my morning. It 
looks like prioritizing the time to 
cook healthy meals for myself and 
making sure I get adequate sleep. 
It looks like being honest with my 
emotions and communicating with 
others my boundaries and capacity, 
in the words of Zandt, saying “yes” 
or “no” when I really mean it. And 
it looks like recognizing that even, 
and especially, in the day-to-day, we 
must choose to preserve ourselves 
for our own sake and for others’. 
“Our existence is resistance,” as is 
famously said, and I believe this to 
be true.

T

his March, outcry arose during 
the NCAA March Madness tour-
nament when Sedona Prince, a 

forward for the Oregon Ducks women’s 
basketball team, posted a TikTok compar-
ing her team’s weight room to that of their 
male counterparts. The men’s weight room 
was an expansive gym full of machines, 
equipment and free weights. The women’s 
weight room was a single rack of dumbbells 
and yoga mats. The NCAA claimed it was 
a space issue, but the TikTok clearly shows 
that the women’s area had ample room for 
a full gym. And while the internet exploded 
in discourse and debate, many women ath-
letes expressed that these disparities are 
nothing new.

Indeed, this controversy is a reflection 

of a greater issue in sports and in society 
overall. Women athletes, and especially 
women athletes of color, are not only paid 
less for the same or better work, but they 
are denied equal economic resources and 
facilities, do not receive fair marketing and 
coverage and suffer stereotyping, sexu-
alization and discrimination. Despite the 
passage of Title IX in 1972, women athletes 
today — at the club, high school, collegiate 
and professional levels — face substantial 
roadblocks to true equality. And while the 
University of Michigan does a good job 
supporting its student athletes who are 
women, the institution of sport overall is 
still skewed to support men and their suc-
cess.

As a woman who grew up playing com-

petitive soccer, I am well aware of the so-
cial disparities that occur on and off the 
field — less fans coming to the women’s 
games, having to prove yourself while the 
men do not and the pressure to look good 
after sweating for 90 minutes straight, for 
instance. I wondered, then, how these reali-
ties play out on the collegiate level, where 
one’s sport is not a hobby but a job in the 
public eye. Student-athletes are already un-
der a lot of pressure from having to balance 
schoolwork, games and practice, so how do 
their differing identities — like which sport 
they play, their gender, race and socio-eco-
nomic status — and the intersectionality 
of these identities impact their ability to 
thrive in athletics and academics, as well as 
their self-esteem, identity and worldview?

I spoke with seven women from six 

different sports — track & field and cross 
country, gymnastics, rowing, field hockey, 
softball and lacrosse — in the hopes of 
learning about their experiences as women 
student athletes at the University. As a non-
student-athlete, I have witnessed within 
myself, and among other peers who don’t 
play college sports, a tendency to make 
assumptions or stereotypes about student-
athletes, especially with gendered, racial 
and sport-specific lenses. And while these 
seven women graciously allowed me a look 
into their academic, athletic and personal 
lives with common themes linking their 
experiences, this article is merely a glance 
into the diverse, complex institution of 
sport.

Dr. Ketra Armstrong, professor of Sport 

Management and director of Diversity, 
Equity & Inclusion for the School of Kine-
siology, touched on the idea of a universal 
student-athlete experience during a Zoom 
interview.

“I’m always hesitant to paint that expe-

rience as a monolith,” Armstrong said. “It 
differs if they’re a Black student or a stu-
dent of color. Or if they’re a student of color, 
and they’re female and they’re an athlete 
playing what is considered a ‘masculine 
type sport.’ So there’s a multiplicity of iden-
tities that are at play when you look at those 
two buckets of being a student and being an 
athlete.”

Indeed, identity impacts experience; 

even so, there are the typical obstacles most 
women athletes face every day. Sexist com-
ments. Body image issues. Social and po-
litical engagement. Viewership disparities. 
These are encountered in the classroom 
or while competing; women athletes suf-
fer many of the common grievances of the 
patriarchy and those that come with their 
sport.

“They’re trying to deal with a lot,” Arm-

strong said. “They’re trying to be students, 
they’re trying to be athletes and they’re try-
ing to be citizens … citizens of the campus, 
citizens of the community, citizens of the 
world. So that’s a lot to ask of a person to do 
and to do it successfully and impactfully.”

And yet, just as they do on their field, 

court, track or floor — they push through, 
they persevere. 

“Athletes, particularly, they’re high per-

forming,” Armstrong said. “They’re resil-
ient, first and foremost, let’s not forget that. 
They’re resilient.”

T 

he University of Michigan has 
13 men’s and 14 women’s varsity 
sports, but if you’re not an avid 

sports fan, you are probably only familiar 
with two: men’s football and men’s bas-
ketball. Indeed, these teams are central 
to our campus spirit and identity: The fall 
football season builds a sense of camara-
derie even for those who barely watch the 

games, and the March Madness tourna-
ment is another excuse to get drunk and 
excited over a maize-colored jersey. Much 
of these sports’ popularity comes from 
American culture and tradition, as well as 
the history of the athletic program, but it 
is sustained through powerful marketing 
and resourcing — which is possible, con-
sidering these sports are the major drivers 
of revenue for the University. The NCAA’s 
model, which has shifted from providing 
holistic academic and athletic opportuni-
ties to optimizing profit, has led to the cuts 
of many D1 athletic programs and hindered 
the growth of already existing ones.

For women’s athletics, this model can 

be an even deeper threat, as retaining 
popularity and viewership has proven dif-
ficult for these teams in the past. Not only 
do women athletes have to break through 
patriarchal stereotypes about who sport is 
for (traditionally, men) and which sports 
are “better” to watch (i.e. claims that men’s 
games are more exciting), but they have to 
fight for equal representation in market-
ing and media. The NCAA was criticized 
this year not only for the weight room 
fiasco but also because of its March Mad-
ness Twitter account. Its bio reads: “The 
official NCAA March Madness destination 
for all things Division I NCAA Men’s Bas-
ketball.” It seems unfair to claim that “just 
not enough people like watching women’s 
sports” when there’s barely a mention of 
the women’s tournament — how are you 
supposed to get new fans if people aren’t 
aware of the games?

It’s a phenomenon that LSA fifth-year 

senior Nadine Stewart, a lacrosse player 
studying Biopsychology, Cognition and 
Neuroscience, described to me over a 
Zoom call. Stewart explained how the Uni-
versity’s women’s lacrosse games are not 
televised; rather, they are streamed on Big 
Ten Network Plus, which requires a paid 
subscription. 

“Some people obviously don’t have 

(BTN Plus), so they can’t watch, so we can’t 
really get a huge following,” Stewart said.

This lack of proper representation is 

also visible in the sports media. In one 
study of sports news in Southern Califor-
nia, it was found that while women and 
girls make up 40% of all athletes, they re-
ceived only about 4% of news coverage. 
More so, the researchers found “a stark 
contrast between the exciting, amplified 
delivery of stories about men’s sports, and 
the often dull, matter-of-fact delivery of 
women’s sports stories.” Again, it seems un-
fair to claim that women’s sports are inher-
ently “less exciting” when they have been 
preemptively characterized and marketed 
as a boring, required subset of men’s sports 
and not in their true, action-packed nature.

While the U-M Athletic Department, 

which did not respond to a request for a 
comment by the time of this article’s pub-
lication, makes an effort to uplift both their 
men’s and women’s teams — a point that 
every woman I interviewed made — the 
systemic inequalities in coverage and rep-
resentation are difficult to fully unweave 
from the collegiate level. Business senior 
Kragen Metz, a field hockey player, touched 
on this theme when we spoke over Zoom.

“I think, at the University of Michigan, 

we get such unprecedented experience 
and exposure,” Metz said. “Playing on such 
a high-caliber team has been an incred-
ible opportunity and I’m so appreciative of 
that. However, there are such discrepancies 
where it feels like you’re less valued than 
the men’s program, like you saw with the 
NCAA March Madness for women’s and 
men’s basketball. I feel like that just goes to 
show, if you’re not making money, you’re 
not valued as much as the men’s sport.”

She described how these discrepancies 

are a result of both cultural and institution-
al factors, and are commonly reflected in 
athletic and professional life alike.

“I think that Michigan is working on 

this, (but) I think that they have a lot of 
work to do, especially having been in the 

Business School and then on the field hock-
ey field,” Metz said. “There’s a lot of people 
who just don’t get what it means to be a 
woman in these male-dominated spaces. I 
think that women have to put in a bit more 
work to be recognized the same, and that 
recognition is so hard to come by, especially 
from top leadership. Like, Warde Manuel 
does not really visit us often, Michigan Ath-
letics social media doesn’t feature us very 
often, on BTN we don’t have commenta-
tors. All that stuff would be unheard of for 
a men’s team.”

Business sophomore Sierra Brooks, a 

member of the women’s gymnastics team, 
described one way she deals with the of-
ten difficult experiences of being a woman 
student athlete and the discrepancies that 
arise with it. 

“I think one point where I really real-

ized that, in general, being a female athlete 
was different than a male athlete, was com-
ing to college and just hearing about all the 
viewership issues and even just seeing how 
much money gets put into this program 
versus a different program,” Brooks said. 
“Those were times when … I tried to le-
verage my sense of community with other 
female athletes, because I’ve met so many, 
and we’re all so different. And I’ve loved 
learning about that, because there’s stereo-
types with certain female athletes of certain 
sports … but everyone’s different, and that’s 
something that I’ve loved to see.”

These stereotypes that Brooks de-

scribed are deeply-rooted in a centuries-
long gender ideology that presumes what is 
feminine and what is masculine. 

“The gender ideology that has long 

pervaded the institution of sport, and the 
culture of sports, it has impacted men and 
women,” Armstrong said. “Men who are 
playing in certain sports, they’re affected 
as well.” 

The gender ideology Armstrong men-

tioned has created a theoretical spectrum, 
with one end delineating stereotypically 
“masculine” sports, which are centered 
around power and contact, and the other 
with stereotypically “feminine” ones, 
which focus on aesthetics and nonaggres-
sion. This impacts women who play stereo-
typically-masculine sports — they are often 
classified as “butch” or “buff” — and men 
who compete in stereotypically-feminine 
ones, who are labeled as “gay.” For women 
athletes, this is known as the Female/Ath-
lete Paradox, which “states that athletic 
women face a dilemma; they are expected 
to succeed in their sport while maintaining 
hegemonic femininity.” 

One presumed “masculine” character-

istic is strength. All athletes have muscles 
in some form or another, due to frequent 
practices, conditioning and lifting ses-
sions. Their bodily strength, which is an 
asset while competing, suddenly becomes 
a negative feature for women when they 
enter any space other than an athletic one. 
Business senior Lexi Munley, a member of 
the track & field and cross country teams, 
described this collateral of the Female/Ath-
lete paradox over a Zoom call.

“When I’m wearing a T-shirt or some-

thing, you can see my arms, and because 
I’m more muscular … sometimes people 
make a comment, they’re like ‘oh, you do 
a sport,’ ” Munley said. “And I don’t tone it 
down, but it’s something that’s there and 
not necessarily something I always want to 
be out there … I don’t know what exactly it 
is, but it just draws attention in a way. And 
maybe the root of that is wanting to feel 
more lean and feminine and not just as a 
strong athlete.” 

But this immediately changes when 

competing, Munley said, laughing: “But 
when you’re on the track, you’re like, ‘Yes, 
look at my arm, I will destroy you.’ ”

Indeed, the expectations for women to 

be small, passive and harmless do not align 
with the definition of athleticism, which 
centers around power, activity and confi-
dence. Interestingly, female gymnasts ex-
ist in a space of both strength and fitness 

while also relying on elegance and aesthet-
ics. While other sports, like track and field, 
emphasize a lean body type, gymnasts are 
usually more muscular; this contradicts the 
Western feminine ideal of thin women. And 
yet, gymnastics is known as “feminine” be-
cause of the aspect of appearance that goes 
along with the sport — in the leotards and 
glamorous makeup and hair, for instance.

Olivia Karas, alum of the U-M women’s 

gymnastics team, discussed how people 
perceive gymnasts, particularly in regards 
to their bodies.

“Something that men will never under-

stand about women, and specifically ath-
letes won’t understand about female gym-
nasts, (is) when it comes to literally putting 
your body out there on a balance beam or 
on a floor, under the lights in front of 10,000 
people in a crowd on TV, you’re really out 
there, and it’s open for interpretation,” 
Karas said. “And it’s open for discussion of 
potentially your weight, or how your body 
is formed or whatever, and so that’s some-
thing about being a woman that’s just really 
difficult in the gymnastics space.”

Similar to Munley, Karas described mo-

ments of insecurity when it came to her 
muscles outside of the athletic space.

“In high school, a lot of people would say 

things to me like, ‘You look like the Hulk,’ 
or like, ‘You have the perfect man body, like 
a V’, ” Karas said, noting that this changed 
during college. “It’s a little embarrassing 
because it’s like, why can’t I fit in this dress, 
or when I’m in a swimsuit, it’s just like, 
‘look at her back’, and … it makes you self 
conscious, because then you see … these 
women, traditionally-looking women, and 
that means dainty, I suppose, if that’s what 
people want to associate women with, and 
it shouldn’t be that way.”

The Michigan women’s gymnastics 

team after getting their first score over 198 
in the athletic program’s history.

The link between strength and mas-

culinity also plays into the perception of 
women athletes, especially those with vis-
ible muscles, as violating gender norms and 
contradictory to heteronormative gender 
expectations. One paper on the Female/
Athlete Paradox describes how this im-
pacts perceived sexuality.

“Associating female athletes with les-

bianism has been a common theme in the 
United States and ‘follows a belief in the 
myth of the masculinization and mannish-
ness of athletic women,’the paper states. 
“Females’ sexual orientations are often 
judged according to their physical build; 
those who exhibit a more muscular body 
type are more likely to be labeled ‘dyke,’ 
‘butch,’ or ‘lesbian.’”

LSA senior Lou Allen, a softball player 

studying Political Science, commented on 
how these perceptions were present even 
from a young age.

“There’s actually a saying in softball 

called ‘No Bow, Lesbo,’” Allen said. “Back 
when I was in my travel ball, when I was 
younger … it was a legit thing, like if you 
didn’t wear a bow, everyone was gonna as-
sume that you were a lesbian.”

Allen, who is bisexual, described ques-

tioning the practice as she got older and be-
gan exploring her own identity.

“I got to the point where I was wear-

ing like cheerleader bows, like these huge, 
huge things, so that it would be known,” Al-
len said. “And then like I went through my 
phase, I’m bisexual, so I went through all of 
that and I’m trying to figure out my identity 
and everything so I even got to a point of 
like, do I wear a bow? Am I supposed to? 
Am I supposed to be involved in this? Does 
this mess up my identity, because I don’t 
know what to do here, I like both. So what 
am I supposed to do?”

The dissonance between identity and 

expectation is one that is especially con-
toured not only by gender and sexuality, 
but also race. LSA junior Haven Essien, a 
member of the women’s rowing team 
studying French as well as Molecular and 
Cellular Developmental Biology, discussed 

the various stereotypes she encounters as a 
biracial woman.

“From what I’ve encountered, how 

male athletes are accepted or approached 
versus how female athletes are accepted or 
approached, is there’s always this additional 
physical aspect,” Essien said. “Even in high 
school, or even in middle school, it wasn’t 
about my work ethic, or it wasn’t about how 
much time I was putting into something, 
nobody ever thought about that. It was al-
most solely an aspect of physicality. I mean, 
again, I’m different, so I am perceived to be 
a stereotype, because I’m biracial, but I’m 
presenting Black. So, it was always, ‘Oh, you 
have African legs, that’s why you’re so fast’, 
or ‘Oh, your height, this makes sense.’ “

This idea that women athletes are bod-

ies first and athletes second represents how 
women are perceived generally: As bodies 
first, people second. Our identity is, accord-
ing to society, inextricably linked to our 
sexuality and subservience to men. Athletes 
especially are in a vulnerable spot, because 
their bodies and what their bodies do are 
central to the form of entertainment that 
is sport. As Karas mentioned regarding the 
“invited” scrutiny of the woman gymnast’s 
body, athletes are historically viewed as at-
tractive bodies meant for us mere mortals 
to watch and appreciate. But what seems 
like an appreciative experience can actually 
reduce athletes to one dimension and pur-
pose, often a sexualized or fetishized one; 
and once you add the contours of race and 
gender, this perception becomes even more 
sinister.

“These athletes tend to be seen as some-

thing for them (non-athlete consumers), 
because they’re already shown on the en-
tertainment. That’s kind of what the NCAA 
and Big Tens and ESPN Sports in general 
is showing athletes as: props for entertain-
ment and less about people,” Essien said. 
“So I think that also comes into people not 
necessarily seeing them (athletes) as hu-
man beings and then just seeing them as, 
like, ‘Oh, I’m going to college, and I want to 
hit up like a cute Black football player.’”

Essien also discussed how when people 

perceive athletes as one-dimensional, this 
creates the false notion that they are only 
admitted to the University because of their 
athleticism; this often overlaps with racist 
stereotyping.

“I’ve heard: ‘Oh, that makes sense,’.. like, 

(that) I got into Michigan because I’m an 
athlete?” Essien said. “I think, for men of 
color, it’s almost assumed that you are an 
athlete or that you’ve gotten in with some 
sort of scholarship or whatever.”

As the United States is undergoing a po-

litical and social reckoning, the positioning 
of athletes as simply bodies for our enter-
tainment is quickly wearing out. And while 
athletes have been vocal in political move-
ments for the entire history of sport, there 
was a page-turning moment in 2016 when 
NFL player Colin Kaepernick began tak-
ing a knee during football games to protest 
police brutality against Black people. In the 
years that followed, we have seen increased 
activism from notable players such as LeB-
ron James — who was told to “shut up and 
dribble” after discussing being Black in 
America and talking about former President 
Donald Trump — and Megan Rapinoe, who 
has been an advocate for LGBTQ+ rights 
and gender equality, among other things. 
We have witnessed multiple teams in the 
WNBA lead social-justice movement in 
sports, being the first teams to wear “Black 
Lives Matter” shirts before games and help-
ing push the vote and flip a Senate seat.

When it comes to social justice leader-

ship or striving for gender equality, athletes 
at all levels and of all genders and races are 
banding together to push a new movement. 
Armstrong, who has worked in all types of 
sport spaces, commented on her hope for 
the future generation of athletes.

“I’m reluctantly hopeful, but I’m also 

happy when I see high schoolers standing 
up and saying, ‘You know, this is not right. 
This country has to change. I’m not stand-
ing up in support of this flag,’ ” Armstrong 
said. “It’s like when I see high schoolers 
having conversations about race. I listened 
to a conversation of these high school stu-
dents talking about anti-racism, and like 
wow — that’s pretty special.”

The links between sport culture and 

society are clear and necessary to observe. 

“Sport is an entity in society, it mir-

rors and reflects society,” Armstrong said. 
“Some of the things we see in the world, we 
definitely also see them in the institution 
of sport.”The experiences of women stu-
dent athletes in social or academic spaces, 
as well as the institutional and philosophi-
cal pressures that define their identity and 
sense of belonging, can be easily extrapolat-
ed to the nature of womanhood in Ameri-
can society. We are constantly forced into 
impossible spaces, paradoxes that tell us to 
be one thing but not the other — but only 
in certain circumstances, certain settings. 
In understanding how these processes 
impact women and further our inequality 
with men, we can begin grappling with the 
systems and ideologies that prevent our so-
ciety from true equality.

Becoming Alice

I 

like to joke that I-94 and I-80 are my second 
homes. I’ve spent thousands of miles on them, 
miles that trade scenery for ease — hop on and 

drive, no directions needed. The “check engine” light 
on the dashboard of my old car kept me company, a 
constant presence lingering in the corner of my vi-
sion. It was accompanied by a symphony of other 
warning lights who came and went as they pleased. 
My brain felt a lot like that dashboard: internal prob-
lems and topics I didn’t understand simmering away 
under layers of metal and avoidance.

“It’s when the lights aren’t flashing that some-

thing’s actually wrong,” I’d profess to nervous passen-
gers with a laugh. “She runs just fine.” 

Of course, she didn’t. My car, referred to by friends 

as “the Deathbox,” eventually ended up in the shop, 
a mechanic instructing my parents to never let me 
drive it again. “The frame’s rusted out,” the mechanic 
told them. “If she gets hit, the car will basically disin-
tegrate.” 

Turns out, an inadvertent car crash is what hap-

pens when you bushwack through life on someone 
else’s rules. I’d had warning lights simmering in my 
body for years, finally coming into themselves during 
my first years of college. My warning lights looked like 
nervous shots of Svedka in my dark kitchen while my 
boyfriend drove to my house, my first time looming, 
unspoken, between us. It’s easier when you’re drunk, 
obviously. And more fun. Or, later, anxiety attacks on 
the cold concrete floor of my workplace, my body 
pulled to the ground by guilt and shame after hook-
ing up with a longtime male friend. Or a journal page, 
folded away from even my closest friends, where 
I’d written, “I feel as if sex is something I owe to my 
partner — I’m not doing it against my will, but I don’t 
understand how it’s supposed to make me feel.” Or 
finishing a movie next to a boyfriend, wondering how 
long I could watch the screensaver camera pan over 
the Sahara before we’d have to go to bed. I felt defec-
tive. I shook during every physical interaction, a small 
but noticeable tremble, and I told partners to ignore it. 

And ignore it, we did. Following my friend’s exam-

ples, I tried everything to fix this part of me. I pined 
after a friend for two years, went on an almost-blind 
date that turned into a six-month relationship, even 
initiated a friends with benefits situation during my 
semester abroad (trying everything doesn’t quite lend 
itself to originality). Each was manageable — which 
isn’t the same as enjoyable.

I thought casual hookups would be empowering 

— in a society that profits off women’s sexualization 
through advertising but punishes them for taking 
ownership of their bodies through sex work, casual 
dating and hookup culture makes more sense. Wom-
en don’t need a relationship, which deems sex appro-
priate and private, to enjoy themselves. I’ll shout from 
the rooftops about sex positivity, and actually have, 
but it wasn’t helping me get anywhere.

***
I 

never had a successful relationship in high 
school, and I find it perplexing that some people 
start college with zero relationship experience 

and others come convinced they’d already found 
their life partner. What an odd world to enter: By age 
and education level college students are mostly on the 
same page, but emotionally, we’re all over the map. 

At 18, I was convinced I was emotionally and sexu-

ally stunted, and that was no way to enter college. The 
spring of my senior year, a friend and I spent our after-
noon watching the girls’ tennis matches, then drifted 
over to the risers next to the baseball field. She’d been 
dating the same person for several years, and still is, 
though we’ve lost contact. At the time, I found her 
long-term relationship baffling and jealousy-induc-
ing. 

“Isn’t a part of you, even a tiny part, just, like, inter-

nally screaming the whole time?” I asked. 

“Uh,” she said, visibly confused. “No, I think that’s 

just you.” 

Right.
And before my mother makes a note in the margin 

saying, You’re 18. Eighteen. Still in high school. Calm 
down. I can’t help it. My brain stampedes forward, 
content only when worrying over what I’m doing 
wrong.

As I was heading into college and hookup cul-

ture, including casual dating, friends with benefits 
and the inevitable “talking” stage my generation is 
famous for, I didn’t know how any of it worked. For 
me, it was more like watching a movie with my high 
school boyfriend in our basement, my parents asleep 
upstairs because they trusted me. They were right not 
to worry — not because I was responsible, but because 
I couldn’t cuddle with my own boyfriend without that 
inevitable tremble. I felt afraid of something, but I had 
no idea what it was.

“Are you cold?” he asked. 
Nope.

***
Y

ears later, I spent a summer pandemic night 
driving from Ann Arbor to St. Joseph. Tech-
nically, my body was controlling the car: my 

right hand on the bottom of the steering wheel, my 
left foot shoeless, propped up on the seat, knee resting 
against the door. Some of my brain understood I was 
on a highway, but most of it had checked out miles 
ago, wandering off beyond my control. It was pictur-
ing a future — mine, apparently — but in the hazy, 
slow-motion montage Hollywood adores. A highlight 
reel had surfaced from my subconscious, ready to de-
but years of secret musings. The reel spun, revealing 
scenes of my life, only with one key change: In every 
scene, a woman was next to me. 

A woman? 
Aided by semi truck headlights and my own 

anxiety, I tried to scrape my brain away from its own 
movie. A woman? That doesn’t make sense. I couldn’t 
name any woman that I’d been sexually attracted to, 
any time during hookups I’d imagined that scenario 
or any “sexual awakening” queer people laugh about. 
And yet, the big picture made immediate sense. The 
rest would follow, I assumed. 

A woman? 
I pulled into my parents’ driveway, parking my 

Subaru in a tangible place I knew well, while falling 
into an intangible world I’d accidentally unearthed — 
a wonderland, still to be determined.

A woman? I turned the car off. 
Well, shit. I guess I better do something about that.

***
L

ooking back, I’m not sure why I never consid-
ered I might be queer. Actually, I had thought 
about it and reported to my mom that I was 

“hopelessly straight” in a phone call we now laugh 
about. 

The idea that I could be someone else always ex-

isted, of course. I watched several friends from high 
school disappear into their lives, deep in college or a 
new city, before emerging with a same-sex partner. 
Their initial Instagram photo, showing a happy cou-
ple, seemed to be posted with ease, taking its place in 
a grid of photos peppered with ex-boyfriends. Later, 
I went back to these people’s profiles, looking at the 
thin white lines between their posts. That’s where the 
real work lies: the therapy appointments, whiskey-
laced confessions of wanting to kiss girls, rehearsing 
coming out moments, unpacking hookups with part-
ners that felt obligatory and quiet assumptions we 
make based on what feels real.

The idea that I could be someone other than who 

I’d always been was liberating, but mostly alarming. 
I had 10 years of culture — social media, Hollywood, 
the internet, music — teaching me how to think about 
and pursue heterosexual relationships. I knew what 
straight sex “looked” like when I was far too young. 
I spent my teenage years learning what made me at-
tractive or unattractive, how to do my makeup to be 
deemed pretty, what clothes can say about my body, 

what to post on social media, what makes someone 
“easy,” what makes someone desirable, what to do be-
fore, during and after sex and maybe the worst part: 
that we’re supposed to enjoy it all. More than once, I 
ended up on my therapist’s couch wondering what 
was wrong with me. There was the physical aspect, 
but also that internal scream I hadn’t yet figured how 
to quiet. 

In college, I put the knowledge to use. I followed 

the rules. My old journals drone on for pages about 
my body and letting other people see it, people who 
weren’t picking it apart inch-by-inch but it didn’t mat-
ter. I’d do it for them. I’d long figured out how to dress 
myself to cover everything I hated — years of scars 
from summers spent outside paired with parts of my 
body that just never felt right. I’ve spent a long time 
with just myself, I wrote, not feeling like I need to have 
my body ready for someone else. I turned the lights off 
and kept my eyes closed.

I grew up in a world that sees women as a com-

modity, dispensable if not perfect. And I bought into 
it, largely passively, letting it fester and rot my sense of 
self into oblivion. I pressured myself into being palat-
able and desirable for others. I hear my mother’s voice 
again. Annie, you’re 22. You can’t talk in the past tense 
like you’ve got it all figured out — of course, I’m not 
done. But naming it is the first step. And one day, all 
those rules I was taught will be obliterated. 

Except, all that knowledge I find completely toxic 

had been my safe space for years. I hated that I knew 
what I was “supposed” to do, but I also relied on it to 
get me through six years of dating men. 

I had no rulebook on how to date women, and for 

once, I desperately wanted one. 

***
I 

ended up back on my therapist’s screen com-
plaining that I’d already gone through the years 
of anxiety before my first time with a male part-

ner, and here I was doing it all again. I threw a tan-
trum in the privacy of my one-bedroom apartment, 
read Glennon Doyle’s “Untamed,” and downloaded 
TikTok, whose algorithm decided I was queer in 
about ten minutes. 

And I can’t lie, the miles of videos I scrolled 

through helped. I hadn’t come out yet — I didn’t even 
know what to come out as. But now I could learn this 
new world. It involved several trips to Urban Diction-
ary as I learned the lingo and new Spotify playlists of 
queer artists, kept secret. After a couple weeks, two 
things grew: the fire under my ass and imposter syn-
drome. 

I called one of my good friends, Olivia, who’d al-

ready walked this road. I like to say we met 15 years 
later than we should’ve. She barreled into my life at 
full force, a perfect mess of black curls and red lip-
stick, the confidence I only dreamed of having and 
stories of ex-boyfriends in Chicago and Grand Rap-
ids, men who were years older, heartbreaks that had 
shattered her. When she turned up one day with a 
girlfriend, not one part of me was surprised. Liv does 
what she wants. 

“I think I might like girls,” I said, pacing around my 

apartment, a glass of honey whiskey in my left hand. 
The hazy image I’d seen on my drive was encouraging 
but didn’t give me much to start with. 

“Well, obviously,” she laughed. “I’ve known that 

for five years.”

“What? What do you mean? Why didn’t you tell 

me?”

“You had to figure it out for yourself!” she said, still 

giggling. “I’ve been waiting!” 

Are you f-cking kidding me.
Obviously, she was right — about both things. I 

gave myself a few minutes to lament the past six years 
of boy-induced stress, but it doesn’t take a therapist to 
know that of course, I wouldn’t have ended up franti-
cally calling my friends, asking about women, asking if 
it made sense, without those years. 

Over the next six months, the pieces would start 

falling into place. I did fall in love with someone. It 
wasn’t easy, and it ended sooner than we both wanted. 
But it was finally the right kind of hard, the kind Glen-
non Doyle wrote about. I spent two days straight with 
her, and wanted more, when I’d once considered four 
hours with a boyfriend too much. I’d find my hands in 
hers or resting on her legs, always quietly reaching for 
her. We discussed body image long before taking our 
clothes off, savoring each other’s empathy. We ate din-
ner on the Chicago river, unpacking our internalized 
homophobia. My scream quieted. 

By mid-September, a safe distance after my I-94 

awakening, I decided it was time to tell my parents. 
It was mostly prompted by the large pride flag hang-
ing from the flower box outside. I’d ordered it in late 
summer, feeling like I’d graduated to a new level in the 
gay world. It came twice as large as expected, and I 
was three nails deep in the layers of white paint before 
realizing ripping it down was the only way to hide it. 
So I called them. 

While the phone rang, I typed a quick script into 

my Notes app. Hi, Mom. I just wanted to let you know 
I’m dating someone. Her name is Emma. 

***
E

ven from the first realizations, I knew this step 
would be much less painful than other peo-
ple’s. I’m incredibly lucky. My parents taught 

me to work hard but also to play hard, that nothing 
good ever happens after midnight and that inclusion 
makes us better. But when your kid calls and com-
plains about being straight, then five months later 
phones with the opposite message, a certain amount 
of whiplash is permitted. 

I’m not a parent, of course, but I do have two and 

a decent prediction of how they’d react. My mother 
taught me how to write, gave me a loud voice and 
strong opinions and an expectation that I’d use them. 
My dad taught me that the first step to solving most 
problems is listening to music while drinking a beer 
in the sun, our favorite activity. She had an idea of how 
my life would go; my dad wanted me to be safe, secure 
and happy. It took her a few minutes to mourn the life 
she’d envisioned for me. I’d done the same, though in 
the privacy of my own mind. The future I assumed 
I’d inhabit, built by familial and societal expectation, 
plus watching my friends graduate and move into the 
world, following the rules we’re taught based on what 
we decided is normal, no longer seemed so inevitable. 

I’d like to think my mother realized that my hab-

it of incessantly questioning my surroundings and 
pressing for better ones came from her. Something 
like this was bound to happen. My dad never cared 
who I brought home, as long as that person treated 
me well and appreciated a good red wine. My parents 
fell asleep upstairs because they’d put a good head 
on my shoulders and trusted I’d use it to unlearn the 
rules of the world we’d all grown up in. 

Compulsory heterosexuality is a tricky thing. I’d 

retreated from normal dating situations, believing I 
was always better off alone, that something was fun-
damentally wrong, that it was my fault. I built amaz-
ing friendships with men I love dearly, but friendship 
seemed to be all I was capable of. 

In an ideal world, our lives would mirror the nar-

rative structure we’re taught in elementary school. Af-
ter that drive down I-94, I’d fall in love with a girl, my 
body would relax, my brain would rest. I’d be normal. 

When Glennon Doyle’s life took a sharp left turn, 

she was more frustrated that her book’s plot had 
been ruined than her life. In the past six months, my 
scream has softened, but it didn’t disappear. I still 
keep the lights off whenever possible. And every once 
in a while, a tremble trickles out of my body, remem-
bering the years that it protected me. 

Be here now, my therapist tells me. And I add: Take 

up space. Trust your body. Nothing good ever hap-
pens after midnight (well, maybe 2 a.m, Dad). Ask 
questions and be grateful for the answers — especially 
when they’re not perfect.

ating tip: If you want to re-
ally get to know someone, 
take a scroll through their 

TikTok “For You” page. From there, 
a stream of 15-second video and 
audio clips will teach you about 
the many little idiosyncrasies and 
bizarre interests you might need 
to know to move things along with 
that prospective special someone.

I gave this a try recently, sheep-

ishly offering my niche “For You” 
page tab for my date to peruse. 
Looking over her shoulder as she 
surveyed the likes of my meticu-
lously-cultivated, 
liberal-parents/

outfit-of-the-day/iced-coffee/wlw 
(women loving women) “sides” of 
TikTok, I quickly realized the ma-
jority of the videos that the app’s al-
gorithm had strung together for me 
were all tinged with a certain level 
of, well, gayness.

Like many other Gen Z-ers, I 

first bought into the TikTok craze 
in those fateful months leading up 
to the shutdown of public life mid-
March, when the COVID-19 out-
break was officially declared a glob-
al pandemic. A few months prior, I 
had begun frequenting the app as 
a kind of Youtube-esque platform 
that seemed to cater to the rapidly-
shrinking attention spans of people 
my age with its pocket-sized videos. 
And it was also around this time 
that I first began to seriously ques-
tion my (non) heterosexuality, talk-
ing to my LGBTQ+ friends about 
their experiences and tip-toeing 
into the sphere of gay dating apps.

After having been sent home, 

along with all of my other peers, I 
unintentionally entered a kind of 
real-life case study testing the fol-
lowing variables: quarantine iso-
lation, sexual identity formation 
and a platform called TikTok that 
had proliferated the global digital 
sphere. Having just separated from 
the LGBTQ+ community I found at 
the University of Michigan, mid-
quarantine TikTok meant I could 
continue learning about and seeing 
diverse representations of queer 
femmes across the world. With this, 
I could circumvent the kind of re-
ductive representations of queer 
women long broadcasted to me 
across mainstream media. 

Upon my own reflection and af-

ter numerous conversations had 
with other queer-identifying Gen 
Z-ers on and off campus, I can say 
with confidence that these non-het-
erosexual ideations have always ex-
isted. TikTok has simply concreted 
and digitalized the breadth of queer 
experience — from finding your 
style to “coming out” to navigating 
your first queer relationship. And 
this visibility carries invaluable 
significance to LGBTQ+ Gen Z-ers 
across the world who, due to their 
religion or familial background or 
local community, may not be able to 
find any other, relatable queer con-
tent to consume. 

A crash course on queer commu-
nity and cultivating safe spaces

The need to access cultural con-

tent representative of queer iden-
tity has been a fundamental struggle 
within the LGBTQ+ community, 
which has been forming our own 
spaces separate from heteronorma-
tive culture for decades. From the 
century-long proliferation of New 
York City’s ball culture, a perfor-
mance phenomenon developed by 
and for queer people of color, to the 
advent of Queercore punk music in 
the 70s and 80s, the cultivation of 
subcultures distinct from heteronor-
mative norms has been a trademark 
of forming and nurturing queer iden-
tity. 

TikTok’s ability to digitize this 

formation of queer subculture is not 
entirely unprecedented — the on-
line platform Tumblr accomplished 
a similar feat when it gained promi-
nence among Gen Z-ers in the 2010s. 
In an article for the Cinema Journal, 
American Studies professor Allison 
McCracken likens Tumblr to “an 
alternative, tuition-free classroom, 
a powerful site of youth media lit-
eracy, identity formation, and politi-
cal awareness that often reproduces 
cultural studies methods of media 
analysis. Tumblr’s design makes to-
day’s progressive youth subcultures 
(including ‘LGBTQ-identified fans’) 
‘on the ground’ visible to us.”

The idea of “on the ground” queer 

visibility, or completely authentic 
portrayals of queerness, is exception-
ally important for a community that 
has been historically stigmatized and 
caricatured by mainstream media 
for decades — specifically for queer 
women. Lesbian representation re-
flected in TV and movies during my 
childhood met a dead-end of pixie-
haircut and flannel-clad stereotypes. 
Platforms like Tumblr and TikTok 
are so successful in countering these 
types of reductive tropes because 
they place the power back in the 
hands of content-creators — real-life 
gay women whose mere existence 
and visibility dismantle heteronor-
mative stigmas of femme queerness. 

Towa Bird, Avery Cyrus, Marthe 

Woertman, Sof Adelle and count-
less other leading queer content 
creators on TikTok are showing us 
that women-loving women come in 
every shape, size, color and gender 
presentation — and you don’t even 
need cable TV to access that level 
of representation. Emma Carey of 
Them Magazine elaborated on the 
significance of this particular lineup 
of creators.

“Through sapphic TikTok and 

its numerous fandoms, young queer 
women and femmes are carving out 
a space to connect with each oth-
er, especially at a time when many 
physical LGBTQ+ spaces are inac-
cessible due to the pandemic,” Carey 
explained. “(Towa) Bird and her 
contemporaries are more than just 

relatable influencers, heartthrobs, 
or icons of the moment. They are 
the vanguard of a community greater 
than themselves, within which queer 
youths are redefining what safety 
and belonging can look like online.”

The typified “gay” genres of Tik-

Tok content have become so much 
more than little viral videos — 
they’ve become spaces of community 
and solidarity. And the effects of the 
sapphic community in particular are 
being felt across campus, with queer 
femmes finding their own ways into 
coveted, queer TikTok algorithms.

“It is so hard to find interesting 

and relatable queer communities on 
other forms of social media (other 
than TikTok),” LSA junior Marlon 
Rajan wrote in an email to The Mich-
igan Daily. “The queer tiktok com-
munity … at least, the cottage/diy/
lesbian/non-binary side of TikTok 
that I’m on … continues to grow and 
change as my interests do the same.”

For LSA sophomore Anastasia 

Hernando, the nature of the app — 
with the algorithm crafting genres 
of content dubbed the “sides of Tik-
Tok” — has allowed digital connec-
tions to translate into prospective 
friendships with other queer people.

“Sometimes I feel as though these 

‘Sides of TikTok’ have really made 
it easier for people to be exposed to 
more welcoming areas (of the In-
ternet),” Hernando wrote in an with 
The Daily. “I think (TikTok) has re-
ally provided those who have never 
been able to access a queer commu-
nity the ability to relate and even 
make mutual social media friends. 
Especially since you can follow 
someone on Instagram through the 
TikTok app very easily, people have 
been connecting on multiple plat-
forms.” 

LSA sophomore Abby Chris-

tian acknowledged TikTok’s queer 
femme community as both a safe 
space and an area for education and 
continued introspection.

“I think TikTok has helped me 

feel more comfortable in figuring out 
or being in the in-between space on 
certain queer identities,” Christian 
wrote in an email to The Daily. “Es-
pecially in regards to gender identity, 
I’ve been trying to figure out what 
feels right for me and it’s so com-
forting to know that others are hav-
ing the same experience and I’m not 
alone.”

TikTok has cracked the queer code

In conjunction with the app’s 

ability to foster queer communities, 
TikTok’s “on-the-ground” queer vis-
ibility has been characterized by a 
considerable shift toward candid 
depictions of queer presentation. 
That is, it’s begun to democratize the 
physical “codes” that signify that a 
person, (in this case, a female-identi-
fying person) is … you know. 

In my experience, the jewelry box 

of queer femme “signals” promoted 

on TikTok contains the following: 
Chelsea boots, tattoos, nose pierc-
ings, cuffed jeans and a primitive 
affinity for indie-sad-girl artists like 
Julia Jacklin and Phoebe Bridgers. 
When I see any one of or a combina-
tion of these things, I can usually as-
sume that a female-identifying per-
son’s response to the weighted “are 
you gay?” question is affirmative. 

Carey elaborated on this phenom-

enon of queer femmes asking the 
question in a kind of secret, coded 
language and the ways sapphic Tik-
Tok has concretized this experience.

“Sapphic TikTok has grown to 

develop a distinct culture of its own, 
and queer signaling has been an im-
portant way for users to find each 
other through a coded language of 
identification,” Carey said. “‘Do you 
listen to girl in red?’ — a reference to 
the lesbian Norwegian pop star Ma-
rie Ulven — is a stand-in for asking 
a woman if she’s queer. Other signals 
include using the cello theme from 
‘Portrait of a Lady on Fire,’ wearing 
Doc Martens, making wacky ear-
rings, and so much more.”

While today these typified queer 

“codes” have been packaged into 
15-second TikTok videos and catchy 
audio clips, their origins prove much 
more serious in nature, once used 
as a means for avoiding antigay vio-
lence and homophobia.

Researchers in a study by the Na-

tional Library of Medicine noted the 
role of appearance in the perception 
of queer identity.

“Given the vulnerability gay men 

and lesbians face in terms of anti-gay 
violence and prejudice, perceptual 
accuracy provides self-protection, 
both on a physical level and on a cul-
tural level, as queer people attempt 
to convey their sexuality outside of 
the awareness of heteronormative 
society,” the study reads. 

Before “listening to girl in red” 

and “cuffed jeans” were a thing, queer 
people found many other inconspic-
uous ways to express their non-het-
erosexuality. Common practices in-
cluded asking someone if they were 
a “friend of Dorothy” in the 50s or 
following the hallowed “hanky code” 
of the 70s and 80s — which allowed 
queer men to express their sexuality 
via the pre-determined color-code of 
their handkerchief. With these kinds 
of “secret signals,” LGBTQ+ people 
were able to circumvent being on the 
receiving end of explicit homophobia 
and transphobia while still making 
their queerness known to the folks 
who mattered: other queer people. 

Thus, while this phenomenon has 

always existed in some form within 
the LGBTQ+ community, TikTok has 
widely democratized and concret-
ized the experience — curating a tan-
gible set of images, audios and texts 
that queer people can consume and 
learn as widely-recognized “signals.” 
And for people like me who continue 
to sort out their place in the LGBTQ+ 
sphere, TikTok’s treasure trove of ac-

cessible resources has been essential 
in learning and adapting to this se-
cret language.

All about the algorithm: Avoiding 

the “wrong side” of TikTok

I would be remiss not to acknowl-

edge one of the severe disadvantages 
of a platform like TikTok that seems 
to instantaneously filter and distrib-
ute content: falling into the wrong 
algorithm. With a highly-intricate 
“recommendation 
system” 
that 

has been coded to respond to what 
kinds of videos you like, comment 
on and even quickly scroll past, the 
idea is each user’s algorithm would 
be highly-personalized and effec-
tively infinite. You like dog videos? 
And then you press “heart” on a dog 
video? Welcome to an algorithm 
that pushes endless dog videos, bet-
ter known as the “dog video” side of 
TikTok. 

This also means that, after pressing 

one wrong “heart” or clicking on one 
wrong hashtag — like #straightflag 
or #superstraight — you can quickly 
land yourself in a not-so-favorable 
algorithm. This motivates detrimen-
tal effects for queer folks who would 
rather not come across homophobic 
slurs or transphobic sentiment like 
“pick a gender” just one swipe after 
their regularly-scheduled, queer pro-
gramming.

The good, the bad and the gay

In the process of creating this 

“thinkpiece” of sorts, I posted a poll 
on my Instagram story just to gauge 
interest among my LGBTQ+ peers: 
“Do you think TikTok (and the LG-
BTQ+ community it’s fostered) has 
increased the rate at which/amount 
of young people coming out as LG-
BTQ+?” 

Within minutes, my direct mes-

sages were peppered with new, blue 
notifications from friends and peers 
I hadn’t heard from in months (some 
of whom I never even knew openly 
identified as LGBTQ+). In their mes-
sages, they spoke candidly about 
TikTok’s queer community and the 
increase in LGBTQ+ representation 
and even how the app has sparked a 
queer curiosity in them they hadn’t 
channeled before.

TikTok and other Gen Z-centric 

platforms like it have been thorough-
ly criticized for their lack of true, 
human connection. But all I know is 
this: In the age of virtual classes and 
breakout rooms and heartless nice-
ties sent via Zoom chat, I found my 
first blip of something that felt like 
a real connection via TikTok. It was 
this globally-resonant little dance 
app that led people I hadn’t spoken 
face-to-face to in over a year into my 
Instagram DM’s — opening up about 
something as personal as sexuality. 
And for that, I am forever grateful for 
TikTok, and all the good, the bad and 
the gay it brings.

Do you listen to girl in red?: Femme queerness on TikTok

BY GRACE TUCKER, STATEMENT COLUMNIST


B

ack 
in 
September, 

when the University 
of 
Michigan 

announced there would no 
longer be a spring break 
for students and faculty, 
I figured I would be fine. 
COVID-19 did not appear to 
be slowing down anytime 
soon and, with the semester 
concluding on April 30, I 
would benefit more from 
an extended summer than a 
week in March. All in all, it 
seemed to be a good deal.

After the fall semester, I 

was drained. The transition 
from high school to college 
was strenuous, amplified by 
the challenge of studying 
remotely. Our month-long 
break was much needed, but 
in many ways, the hecticness 
from the first few months 
remained. I never felt as 
though I was truly “shut-
off” from the daily grind 
of a college student. Now, 
with a little over a month 
to go before the academic 
year ends, I am wishing the 
administration granted us, 
students, those seven coveted 
spring days. 

Alas, 
the 
University 

thought of “Wellness Days” to 
compensate for the persistent 
workload 
we’ve 
received 

since Martin Luther King Jr. 
Day. And they come in twos 
— separately, of course! This 
will surely alleviate our stress 
and fatigue, right?

Not even close. In February, 

my wellness day was spent 
studying for my upcoming 
Math 115 exam. A few days 
ago, it was spent writing a 
paper for my BCOM 250 class. 
If “wellness” is somehow 
defined by the security you 
experience in knowing that 
you’re a little more prepared 
than you were before or 
taking the necessary steps to 
finish an assignment on time, 
then mission accomplished. 
However, that is not the case.

“Wellness,” 
as 
defined 

by 
the 
Merriam-Webster 

dictionary, is described as 
“the quality or state of being 
in good health especially as 
an actively sought goal.” In 
our current era of isolation 
and social distance, I cannot 
think of a greater priority 
than maintaining our mental 
health. Yet, if that was truly 
the University’s goal, they 
failed 
miserably. 
Instead, 

they should have labeled 
them for what they really 
were: 24-hours-without-class 
days. Understandably, that’s 
not as catchy.

Many of us, including 

myself, 
are 
feeling 

psychologically taxed and 
constrained right now. The 
Zooms and phone calls I’ve 
had 
with 
upperclassmen 

friends to catch up, which 
used to last at least half an 
hour, now barely crack 15 
minutes. What was once 

a 
welcomed 
release 
for 

both parties is now viewed 
as a distraction from the 
contextualized task at hand. 
Moreover, all correspondence 
usually ends the same way 
now: “Yeah I know we’re all 
super busy and things are 
super hectic so I don’t want 
to take up any more of your 
time. Talk to you soon, bye.”

I don’t fault the students 

or the professors for this 
educational 
strain 
we’re 

all experiencing; we’re all 
fulfilling our commitments 
to the University and to each 
other. However, anyone who’s 
learned a thing or two about 
productivity knows that you 
can’t work people to their 
limits for four consecutive 
months. It simply cannot be 
done. 

Let’s 
do 
some 
math. 

Research 
conducted 
by 

psychologists shows that our 
productivity is maximized 
when 
matched 
with 
our 

ultradian rhythms. Therefore, 
we are most efficient when 
we work in longer sessions 
of approximately 90 minutes, 
followed by 15 to 20-minute 
breaks. Out of a given 105 
minutes, we are working 
between 80 and 85% of the 
time, but operating at peak 
productivity. By attending 
classes alone, students of the 
University of Michigan are 
“working” nearly every day 
of the semester. The only 
reprieve from this work is 
during — you guessed it — 
those golden Wellness Days.

I understand that we’re 

students, not professionals. 
Yet, our otherwise pretty-
darn professional university 
expects a certain level of 
professionalism 
from 

us. This university houses 
some of the world’s best and 
brightest future leaders — 
don’t we want to see what 
we’re 
capable 
of 
when 

we operate at the fullest 
capabilities? I know I sure do. 

Hopefully, this will all 

be a moot point in the fall. 
In a perfect world, when 
the majority of society is 
vaccinated, 
we 
can 
quit 

worrying about the potential 
health 
consequences 
of 

spring break. Hopefully, then 
we can have fun and truly 
unwind for a week, much to 
the enjoyment of everybody 
here in Ann Arbor. 

For now, however, let this 

serve as a cautionary tale. 
We shouldn’t be overworked 
and expected to grind for 
four months straight. Our 
attention will drift, our guard 
will slip and everyone will 
be left to suffer the effects 
of a stressed-out, fatigued 
campus population. How’s 
that for a Wellness Day?

This is far from the first time Weiser 
has spurred outrage with his words 
and actions, not only on campus but 
across the state of Michigan. His 
misbehavior has ranged from sending 
regents an email containing only a 
picture of a woman wearing a bikini 
with no context to urging fellow 
regents to support him during earlier 
calls for his resignation, prompting 
them to “remember Germany in the 
1930s.” Weiser also faced backlash for 
his initial response to the Jan. 6 Capitol 
riot and failure to condemn former 
President Donald Trump. He has failed 
to attend a single regents meeting in 
2021, other than the meeting in which 
he was censured. It is obvious that his 
continuing to serve on the Board of 
Regents undermines the University of 
Michigan’s character, and if he cared 
about the University he would resign 
from his position immediately. 

Nevertheless, he has made it clear 

that he has no intention of doing 
so, accusing those calling for his 
resignation of engaging in cancel 
culture. In light of this, we have chosen 
not to write this editorial to call for his 
resignation, as such an attempt would 
obviously be futile. 

Instead, we implore our state’s 

voters — the people who elected Weiser 
to this position of power — to more 
heavily scrutinize future candidates for 
the Board of Regents, at this university 
and others, and consider how they 
might affect the universities and the 
state of Michigan at large. The only 
avenue to remove Weiser prior to the 
2024 election is an unrealistic one 
— The Daily’s article regarding calls 
for a resignation states, “(Michigan 
Secretary of State Jocelyn) Benson 
would have to file an official petition. 
No later than 25 days following the 
filing of the petition, Benson would 
then have to declare if the petition has 
enough signatures for a recall or not. 
To trigger a recall election, the number 
of signatures on the petition needs to 
equal 25% of votes cast by Michigan 
residents in the 2020 general election.” 
Therefore, voters must think critically 
about who they cast their ballot for in 
2022.

The content of Weiser’s remarks 

has been specifically harmful and in a 
politically divisive atmosphere like the 
one we live in today, any semblance 
of violence should be avoided. There 
have been several acute instances 
of political violence, and threats of 
political violence, in the past year, 
ranging from a right-wing plot to 
kidnap Gov. Gretchen Whitmer last 
fall to the armed riot at the Capitol on 
Jan. 6. It has even happened recently 
here in Ann Arbor. A week ago, a group 
of right-wing “boogaloo bois,” armed 
with large rifles, planted themselves 
in front of Ann Arbor’s city hall in 
an anti-government protest, despite 
cold reception from the community. 
Though this thankfully did not 
escalate into a larger conflict, the fact 
that it is normal in America for armed 
protestors to congregate outside of 
government buildings represents the 
deeply toxic political environment 
that exists in our country. Even in a 
time of political tranquility, it would be 
abhorrent for a member of our Board 
of Regents to joke about assassinating 
members of the government. The fact 
that violence is seen as a valid means 
of political action by so many only 
underscores why Weiser’s charade 
was so dangerous.

Weiser’s use of the term “witches” 

is particularly problematic since this 
misogynistic word has historically 
been used to undermine influential 
women. In 2016, people circulated 
images online of Hillary Clinton 
dressed in a black hat and holding 
a broomstick. The term is harmful 
because it connotes an evil figure 
who should not be trusted, so when 
someone uses it to describe a powerful 
woman, such as Gov. Whitmer, they 
are undermining the legitimacy of 
the referenced woman’s power. And 
when someone as influential as Weiser 
uses this sexist terminology, he gives 
his listeners the language not just to 
criticize the government — which 
should be encouraged in any democratic 
society — but to take it a step further and 
delegitimize the governor’s power on 
the basis of her gender, a reprehensible 
and ominous message. 

During the board’s meeting, Weiser 

apologized for his comments but 
pointedly refused to resign, saying 
instead that he would “not be canceled.” 
This refusal to resign demonstrates 
that, at best, Weiser misunderstands 
the harm his comments caused, and, 
at worst, that he values the power that 
comes with being a regent more than 
his responsibility to the University’s 
students and the state’s voters. 

In 
electing 
Weiser 
as 
an 

administrative member of its second-
largest university, Michigan voters gave 
him a legitimate prominent platform 
on which to speak as a public official. 
Everything Weiser does are the actions 
of a representative of Michigan, rather 
than the actions of a single citizen. The 
comments would be problematic even 
if they came from a private citizen, 
but in being uttered by a University 
Regent — and the Michigan GOP 
chair — those comments will travel 
further and be more harmful to the 
well-being of democracy in Michigan. 
In removing Weiser from his position 
as a regent, his constituents have the 
ability to demonstrate there will be 
repercussions for the flagrant and anti-
democratic language he perpetuated.

It is obvious that Weiser should 

resign. He has repeatedly acted in 
ways that are entirely unbecoming 
of a regent, and these latest remarks, 
with their harmful connotations, 
are simply the icing on the cake. His 
reprehensible comments are rooted 
in misogyny and a clear disregard for 
democratic values, and these actions 
have and will continue to negatively 
impact the Michigan community. 
However, given that Weiser appears 
entirely content to remain on the 
Board of Regents until he goes up for 
reelection in 2024, it is important to 
remember the power that voters have. 

Both University students and 

Michigan residents should maintain 
high standards and demand more 
from their representatives. Though 
the Board of Regents may not be the 
highest-profile election on the ballot, 
voters should keep Weiser’s actions in 
mind as we approach the 2022 elections 
and choose candidates accordingly.

W

hile billions of people worldwide 
have had their lives uprooted 
and 
drastically 
transformed 

by COVID-19, many societal practices from 
the pre-pandemic world have continued. 
Some of these practices are beneficial like 
getting an education and improving medical 
knowledge, while others continue to have 
devastating results on public health and the 
environment. One of these harmful practices 
that has not only continued but worsened 
during the pandemic is deforestation. We have 
seen deforestation efforts increase globally last 
year, leading to catastrophic health effects on 
the environment, climate, people’s everyday 
lives and pandemic prevention. This practice 
must be put to an end in order to ensure that 
people and the planet are safe and healthy. 

2020 was a devastating year for forests 

as global deforestation efforts increased by 
12%. The estimated area of woodlands torn 
down was 10 million square acres — equating 
to roughly the size of Switzerland or Rhode 
Island, Delaware, Connecticut and New 
Jersey combined. The country that included 
the largest spike in tree removal was Brazil 
with an increase in deforestation by 85%. The 
most harmed areas were parts of the Amazon 
rainforest, which happens to be one of the 
world’s largest absorbers of carbon dioxide. 

The next logical question to ask is why is 

deforestation increasing? To answer that, we 
must look at why deforestation occurs at all. 

There is no sole reason as forests are removed 
for everything from infrastructure expansion, 
land-use changes, urbanization and wood 
extraction. The logging and forest removal 
industry is estimated to produce between $30 
billion and $100 billion each year. The massive 
profits from this sector cannot be overlooked 
as they are one of the factors fueling the 
increases we have seen this past year. 

Deforestation’s effect on the environment is 

vast and incredibly damaging. Removing trees 
decreases precipitation, which disrupts the 
water cycle and causes changes to river and 
stream flows. Water is not only vital for forests 
but almost every living thing on the planet. A 
decrease in precipitation could leave species 
and entire ecosystems without water, forcing 
them to fend for themselves or migrate. The 
drop in the amount of water in the ecosystem 
also allows for potential droughts, which 
can disrupt ecosystems by reducing food 
supply. Dry conditions also contribute to an 
increase in forest fires, as the lack of water 
makes it easier for flames to catch and spread. 
Deforestation contributes to soil erosion, 
as tree roots help anchor the soil, and the 
trunks and branches help protect it from wind 
and water. Soil erosion has many negative 
impacts, from loss of fertile land to worsened 
flooding, as the ground can no longer absorb 
floodwaters. Between disrupting the water 
cycle and eroding the soil, deforestation has 
countless consequences on the environment.

Like many of the ways humans interact with 

our environment, deforestation also contributes 
to climate change. Not only does clearing 
forests release carbon dioxide stored in the 
trees into the atmosphere, but it also eliminates 
organisms that absorb carbon. The United 
Nations Food and Agriculture Organization 
found that deforestation accounted for about 
20% of greenhouse gas emissions, making 
it the second-largest contributor to climate 
change. Forests, as a whole, absorb 10 million 
metric tons of carbon dioxide annually, roughly 
equivalent to the emissions from two million 
cars. Essentially, deforestation makes global 
warming worse and adds to climate change on 
two different levels. 

The ramifications of deforestation extend 

beyond the environment and the climate, as it 
affects human public health as well. Removing 
trees and forests directly contributes to an 
increase in infectious diseases that could 
potentially turn into epidemics and pandemics. 
When forests are demolished, animal habitats 
are destroyed and their natural inhabitants 
are forced to migrate into new areas. Whether 
those areas are near humans or just around 
different animals, germs and diseases are 
spread and can become outbreaks. Sixty 
percent of all infectious diseases that affect 
humans originate in animals. 

Moreover, when forests are destroyed, 

animals are forced to move closer to humans 
increasing the likelihood of disease spread. 

This has been observed in Brazil where 
experts believe that the rise in malaria cases 
is directly linked to deforestation. Between 
2003 and 2015, scientists and researchers 
found that an increase of 10% in yearly forest 
loss corresponded with a 3% jump in malaria 
cases. One year that saw an additional 
618 square miles of forests being removed 
resulted in an extra 10,000 cases of malaria. 
Clearing forests directly leads to an increase in 
infectious disease and increases the chances 
that another pandemic — like the current one 
— ravages the world. 

Aside from the harmful effects of 

deforestation, forests also offer many benefits 
to people and public health. One major reason 
is that forests are home to 300 million people 
and 80% of terrestrial biodiversity. Another 
1.6 billion people depend on forests for their 
livelihoods and survival. Forests are also huge 
mitigating factors when it comes to climate 
change and acts to lessen the future effects. 
They function to increase clean oxygen levels 
in the atmosphere as well as moderate global 
temperatures. Deforestation is a dangerous 
practice that must cease before even more 
damage is done to the environment and global 
health. I urge you to speak for the trees, for they 
have no tongues and one day you will wish 
there was something you could have done.

From The Daily: Weiser must resign
A

t a March 25 gathering with the North Oakland Republican Club, Regent Ron Weiser 
(R) called three female Democratic officials “witches” and referenced “burning 
them at the stake.” He also joked that the only way to get rid of two anti-Trump 

Republican congressmen, besides voting, was assassination. On April 2, the University’s 
Board of Regents censured him and called for his resignation, leading Chairwoman 
Denise Ilitch (D) to strip him of his committee assignments. On campus, his actions 
have led to the mock renaming of Weiser Hall and many have called for his resignation.

T

he Order of Angell, formerly 
known as Michigamua, has 
disbanded without any serious 

reparation for the years of indignity and 
harm caused to Indigenous peoples. 
The work of BIPOC Order alumni 
and students has been instrumental in 
stopping this institution’s perpetuation. 
At the end of their website’s apologetic 
history page is a link to the Bentley 
Historical Library’s Order of Angell 
records. You can’t view the actual 
materials online, but if you request them 
ahead of time, helpful staff will bring 
the records out to warmly lit reading 
desks for you. No pens are allowed, 
liquids are prohibited and gloves are 
provided. The records have the name 
“Michigamua” crossed out on the 
large boxes and replaced with “Order 
of Angell” in Sharpie. Call number 
87248: a collection of musty boxes and 
oversized folders that hides an insidious 
history.

Nearly 
a 
century 
of 
archival 

materials kept in the Bentley Historical 
Library does more than just document 
the organization’s misdeeds. I have 
sifted 
through 
these 
materials 

numerous times, trying to understand 
the blueprints that layout tomahawk 
wall-accents on their custom-made 
“wigwam” in the Michigan Union 
tower. Trying to parse through each 
member, each of whom has a dedicated 
“Indian name” such as Silver Throat 
and Dick Weake on the yearly pride’s 
roster. There are so many small 
moments in their sprawling history: 
letters between friends, initiation 
blindfolds and pictures of old white 
men at outdoor banquets in front of 
totem poles. The sheer enormity, the 
utter banality, the paper trail of white 
supremacy was right before me looking 
at the Michigamua archives.

While photographing these records, 

a library aide came up to me and asked 
me if I’d like to see a sculpture in the 
back garden of the Bentley. In this 
library’s graveyard of unwanted icons 
was a stone tomahawk medallion. 
Without any collection number, two 
feet wide, it lay covered in moss on 
the ground. We both stared at it for a 
moment. No one wanted to deal with 
the now-culturally insensitive relic, 
and now it was in the care of the library.

Michigamua’s true legacy was an 

opportunity for predominantly white 
Michigan 
students 
to 
bastardize 

Indigenous culture. One only needs to 
go to the Bentley and see for themselves 
the photographic evidence, as well 
as the excuses and artifacts of U-M’s 
home-grown 
white 
supremacist 

organization. The following comes 
from an account of Rope Day, an 
initiation ritual for Michigamua, taken 
directly from the Bentley records:

“Our rope day ceremony started 

at the rooms. We covered ourselves 
with dry paint mixed with water and 
donned an Indian blanket, a head dress 
of feathers, and a jook strap. We ran, 
skipped and howled down the State 
Street side of the campus carrying a 
long rope. Most of the braves were so 
winded that we had to stop and rest 
several times. We would sit down and 
‘hold a pow wow’ intermingled with 
occasional war whoops. 

“The young bucks gathered at the 

foot of the Tappan Oak at Six booms. 
We circled the tree with the rope, 
binding them against it, tore their shirts 
off and doused them (with) dry paint 
and water. Then we started beating 
them with snow shoes, rope and barrel 
staves.”

I will pause here to let anyone who 

wishes to see the mark of Michigamua 
look at the red-stained bark of the 
Tappan Oak in our Diag. Stopping just 
past human height, the paint stains the 
tree even after all these years. 

Michigamua, even in disbanding, 

still 
manages 
to 
disappoint 
— 

disbanding will never erase its past. 
In their letter issued after disbanding, 
they claimed that, “We realized that 
any actions we could take would 
not be adequate in healing the past 
and improving the future of the 
organization. Ultimately, the historical 
lack of transparency and sufficient 
action prevent the achievement of this 
core mission.” While acknowledging 
their past is a positive step, they 
must go further. Past members must 
engage in some measure of reparation 
and restorative justice before their 
organization is allowed to fade into the 
miasma of “past mistakes.”

As of right now, the only legacy 

Michigamua has left behind is within 
the Bentley Library and the harm 
they’ve done. It is critical for our 
community to remember this harm 
and ensure that another organization 
will not find a place on our campus.

7-Opinion

A

s a columnist for The Michigan Daily, 
I’m not supposed to discuss internal 
Daily issues in my work. However, the 

debate frequently reignited at our elections has 
arisen yet again, and I feel the dilemma is too 
important to keep from our readers. So, to our 
audience, I pose the question: Is it acceptable to 
urinate in the shower?

Perhaps I will receive backlash for this position, 

but, nonetheless, I must remain loyal to my morals 
and proclaim that I take the affirmative stance 
in this debate. Peeing in the shower promotes 
environmental consciousness and personal 
hygiene, and those who do so should not be 
viewed in a negative light.

To do your part in protecting the environment, 

save a trip to the toilet for your shower. While a toilet 
flush uses between 1.28 and seven gallons of water, 
a shower urination only uses around .875 gallons 
of water, which means substituting a toilet flush 
for a minimally longer shower saves somewhere 
between 0.405 and 6.125 gallons of water. It may not 
seem like much, but that slight change in behavior 
could support the average person in Mali for up to 
two days. Unlike those in Mali, though, the average 
American uses around 156 gallons of water each 
day. Given the average person urinates six to eight 
times per day, we can assume that between 7.68 
and 56 of those gallons are used in toilet flushes. 
Eliminating one daily toilet flush, then, could 
reduce daily water consumption significantly, 
prolonging our dwindling water supply and saving 
you money on your water bill.

For many of us, emptying the bladder 

constitutes the use of toilet paper. On average, we 

use between eight and nine sheets of toilet paper 
per trip, meaning we flush 48 to 72 sheets each 
day. Saving a trip’s worth of toilet paper each day 
by peeing in the shower can significantly reduce 
deforestation by making each roll of toilet paper 
last longer, reducing the need for as much toilet 
paper production. So, by peeing in the shower, we 
not only save water, but we save the trees.

Despite the environmental benefits of relieving 

oneself in the shower, it seems as though the 
primary argument against the practice is that it’s 
somehow unsanitary. However, most medical 
experts dispute this claim. Urine is mostly 
water, so rinsing it down the shower drain is not 
dissimilar from rinsing soapy water down the 
drain. Urine is not actually sterile, but the bacteria 
it contains is safe for the body, like the bacteria 
found in one’s mouth or intestines. Peeing in the 
shower is only a risk if you have a urinary tract 
infection, and a very low one at that, as the bacteria 
can spread to the surrounding environment. In a 
normal, UTI-free circumstance, however, saving 
a toilet trip for the shower is perfectly safe.

In my experience, though, some are less 

concerned about the medical safety of peeing 
in the shower and more about the general 
“grossness” of it. To put it bluntly, they don’t like 
the idea that, by peeing in the shower, they’re 
peeing on themselves. However, I would argue 
that if you pee in the shower prior to cleansing 
your body, urination is less “gross” when done 
in the shower than when done in the toilet. 
Depending on one’s anatomy, when peeing in 
the toilet, one generally either uses toilet paper to 
rid the body of any remaining urine, or they do not 

use anything at all. Conversely, by peeing in the 
shower, one fully washes their body with soap and 
water after urination, which is arguably a more 
effective method of cleansing than toilet paper or 
nothing at all. 

The reasons why peeing in the shower is 

cleaner than peeing in a toilet do not end there, 
though. Research indicates that only 31% of men 
and 65% of women wash their hands after going 
to a public bathroom, so one can only imagine that 
these numbers are much lower in a private setting. 
However, urinating in the shower essentially 
forces you to wash your hands, as you follow the 
emptying of your bladder with a thorough washing 
of the entire body, hands included. Peeing in the 
shower rids your body and hands of urine and 
other bacteria more effectively than peeing in a 
toilet does.

None of this is to say you should pee exclusively 

in the shower — I would venture to guess that 
would be inconvenient for most adequately 
hydrated people. I am simply suggesting that you 
relieve yourself each time you shower to minimize 
toilet flushes. It’s good for the environment, it’s 
good for your wallet and it’s perfectly sanitary, so 
why wouldn’t you?

Given that this debate remains a heated one 

in The Daily’s newsroom, I encourage any of my 
fellow Opinion columnists with the opposing 
viewpoint to write a response — some internal 
issues deserve to be made public, especially ones 
with such importance and urgency as this one.

O

ver two months into Joe Biden’s 
presidency, his administration has 
met challenges on multiple fronts. 

The hurdle facing President Biden that has 
perhaps garnered the most attention is the 
troubling immigration crisis at the Southern 
border with Mexico, but Biden’s problems 
go far beyond his improper handling of the 
border crisis. Less discussed but equally 
concerning is the administration’s consistent 
foreign policy mishaps. If not corrected, these 
blunders threaten to undermine the United 
States’ relations with our allies as well as 
exacerbate tensions with adversaries.

The Biden administration’s foreign policy 

got off to a shaky start almost immediately after 
the president’s inauguration. By early February, 
only weeks into Biden’s term, newspapers 
reported the president had still not called Israeli 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu despite 
phoning the leaders of numerous other nations 
like Britain and Japan.

Although Biden finally called Netanyahu 

in mid-February, the nearly one-month delay 
sparked concern — and for a good reason. 
The U.S.-Israel relationship is important for 
stability in the Middle East as well as across 

the world. While it is plausible to assume 
that Biden was holding off because of his 
differences with Netanyahu, as well as the 
prime minister’s poor relations with former 
President Barack Obama, he should have 
established relations with the Israeli leader far 
sooner in order to achieve both his personal 
goals and diplomatic stability. The president 
could 
have 
opened 
relations 
between 

Netanyahu and his administration while still 
disagreeing with him. This error may make it 
more difficult for Biden to accomplish his goals 
in the Middle East, including a potential two-
state solution between Israel and Palestine.

While Biden has left out some world leaders 

from his phone conversations at times, he 
himself has been completely left off other calls. 
Media reports confirm that instead of Biden, 
Vice President Kamala Harris has been on solo 
calls with certain world leaders. The fact that 
the elected president of the United States has 
not been on some of these calls, for whatever 
reason, 
warrants 
tremendous 
concern. 

Every past presidential administration has 
established that the president, in addition 
to being the commander in chief, is the 
chief diplomat. The president is the figure 

that represents the nation at all times and is 
expected to be at the forefront of all diplomatic 
relations and negotiations. If this trend in the 
Biden White House continues, it may erode 
confidence in Biden among our allies and 
other world leaders.

Unfortunately, the administration’s foreign 

policy blunders are not limited to these two 
concerning incidents. Perhaps the most glaring 
mishap has been Biden’s recent comments on 
Russian leader Vladimir Putin. In an interview 
with ABC News, the president accused Putin 
of being a killer. These unexpected remarks 
kicked off U.S.-Russian relations under Biden 
on a strikingly bad note, and Moscow quickly 
reacted with anger. A spokesperson for the 
Kremlin said “there hasn’t 
been 
anything 

like this in history,” charging that Biden had 
no interest in improving the U.S.-Russian 
relationship. Soon after the comments, Russia 
made the decision to recall its U.S. ambassador, 
and the true extent of the damage Biden 
caused began to emerge.

There is no doubt Putin is a figure that Biden 

shouldn’t praise. Russia is certainly not our ally 
and has recently taken a number of problematic 
actions, including likely interfering in the 2016 

presidential election. Russia, according to 
charges from the U.S. and European Union, 
also poisoned Russian opposition leader Alexey 
Navalny with a fatal nerve agent, an action 
that is clearly reprehensible. But Biden’s words 
threaten to stoke tensions further in our already-
inflamed relationship with Moscow, and will 
only spell more trouble in the future. Rather 
than making these remarks, Biden should be 
acknowledging the wrongdoing of nations like 
Russia while still trying to foster productive 
conversations. These recent comments did the 
exact opposite.

While Russia is undoubtedly an American 

adversary, perhaps our greatest world 
adversary is China. With a population of over 
1.4 billion people, our relations with China 
are critical for both political and economic 
purposes. The COVID-19 pandemic and 
questions surrounding the origins of the 
novel coronavirus are the latest signs of how 
vital it is that stable U.S.-Chinese relations 
are maintained. But rather than move our 
critical relationship with China in a promising 
direction, 
the 
Biden 
administration’s 

preliminary talks with Beijing are off to a 
concerning start. The White House held a 

recent summit with Chinese officials in Alaska, 
and while the two sides held conversations 
about numerous issues, the talks broke down 
as American and Chinese diplomats verbally 
attacked each other.

Luckily, the Biden administration is 

relatively young, and the president has many 
more opportunities to improve American 
relations with China. But the White House 
must learn from this summit and change 
its strategy. China has the potential to be a 
defining issue in Biden’s presidency, with 
some experts warning the U.S. is entering a 
Cold War with China. Moving forward, our 
negotiations with Beijing must be handled 
more thoughtfully.

As President Biden enters the final stretch 

of his first 100 days, his administration has 
plenty of time to correct these foreign policy 
mishaps. But the Biden White House has 
considerable work to do if it wants to truly 
“elevate diplomacy” and make America a 
leader on the world stage. That work must 
start immediately.

L

ast week, University of Michigan 
students started backpacking courses 
for the spring, summer and fall 2021 

terms and eagerly checked their registration 
appointment times on Wolverine Access. Usually, 
students have a fair idea of what to expect based on 
past semesters, but this semester has been a little 
different. The University recently announced 
(via an email) a change in how they will assign 
these appointments: Credit obtained via AP or IB 
(International Baccalaureate) coursework is no 
longer a factor in determining one’s registration 
time slot. While it was an overdue change to 
level the playing field, the sudden announcement 
divided opinions on campus. 

While students now know when they can 

begin registering for courses, the true impact 
of the change on course availability remains 
unknown. For students studying computer 
science, the uncertainty is problematic. CS is a 
rare major in that it is offered both by the College 
of Engineering and LSA. It is also one of the 
most popular and fastest-growing majors — for 
example, EECS 280, a required course to declare 
the major, has about 1,200 students enrolled in 
winter 2021.

This is no surprise given employers’ high 

demand for CS graduates and the high starting 
salaries of those positions. However, CS 
departments across the nation are struggling to 
keep up with demand. CS at the University has a 
few required upper-level electives in high demand 
but with huge waitlists due to limited space. 

Here’s where the new change complicates 

matters: Junior and senior CS majors with AP/

IB credits no longer know if they’ll be able to get 
into their planned courses at all. This has reignited 
another discussion on the overcrowding problem 
within the major — and for good reason.

Whenever overcrowding gets brought up, a few 

suggestions are made, like capping the number 
of students in the major (by direct admissions 
or a competitive admissions process, similar 
to the Ross School of Business) or increasing 
the prerequisite requirements (by increasing 
the required grade point average cutoff). The 
University of California-Berkeley has a 3.3 GPA 
requirement across its prerequisite courses, which 
includes all attempts, as opposed to our 2.5 GPA 
requirement that only considers final attempts, 
meaning you can take the class as many times 
as you need to satisfy the grade requirements. 
Additionally, the University of Washington has 
a Direct to Major admissions process for CS and 
advises students who aren’t admitted directly to 
consider attending another university if they are 
set on pursuing CS. Both are notable examples of 
these suggestions in action.

The University of Michigan’s Electrical 

Engineering and Computer Science department 
takes a different approach — one based on a 

commitment to keep the major accessible. Some 
might argue that this stance is not pragmatic 
enough. After all, there is a nationwide shortage 
of CS professors, with departments short-
staffed at numerous universities. The small 
percentage of people opting to get a Ph.D. in CS 
and the competition for experts from the industry 
contribute to this problem. In this context, is it 
feasible for the University to continue like this? 

Actually, yes. Dr. Westley Weimer, a professor 

in the EECS department, provided an in-depth 
analysis of the waitlist issue. The case of “over-
enrollment” where there aren’t enough seats for 
everyone to graduate on time is the main worry 
with an open major. The University’s CS program 
finds itself in a place with “enough seats in 
electives for people to graduate.” There is a caveat 
of having long waitlists at the start of the semester 
(a consequence of no limits on waitlisting 
courses) and the possibility of not getting your 
first preference all the time. Currently, everyone 
who majors in CS can graduate in four years. The 
University can continue like this for now, but this 
begs another question: Should we continue like 
this?

Berkeley and UW chose their measures to 

reduce enrollment into the major and ensure they 
can keep up with the demand. That approach 
skews the accessibility of the major heavily in 
favor of students with CS experience during high 
school. High school coursework can cover parts 
of the prerequisites, giving certain students a head 
start, and direct admission into the major would 
inherently favor those luckier few. 

For a field notoriously lacking in diversity, 

such a move would aggravate the problem. A 
capped major would also deprive the world of 
many exceptional computer scientists. Think 
I’m exaggerating? University alum Bill Joy, a 
co-founder of Sun Microsystems and creator of 
the vi program, says in Malcolm Gladwell’s book 
“Outliers” that he initially planned on majoring in 
biology or math. He was enamored with CS in his 
freshman year, changed majors and then went on 
to change the world.

Any limit imposed on the major — direct or 

indirect — is imperfect. Given the choice between 
imperfect systems, one that prioritizes access is 
perhaps the best. It is certainly the least disruptive. 

Consequently, our focus should shift toward 

improving the current system. Be it an increase 
in faculty — which the department was pursuing 
before the pandemic-imposed hire freeze — or 
exploring remote/hybrid course options, many 
measures can be taken to improve the student 
experience. Until then, students can rest easy that 
despite the registration policy change, they will be 
able to graduate on time.

In defense of open majors

The case for D.C. statehood
W

ashington, D.C., is home 
to our country’s most 
important 
democratic 

institutions. Yet, those living in our 
nation’s capital lack both their own 
representation in Congress and full 
control over their local government. 
Congress must address this issue and 
push for statehood to ensure that D.C. 
residents have the same representation 
and autonomy as other Americans. 

The issue of D.C. statehood is not new. 

For centuries, residents of Washington, 
D.C., have advocated for statehood 
or some other form of increased 
congressional representation. However, 
the issue has brought more attention to 
it over the past few years.

The arguments for D.C. statehood 

are clear. There are nearly 700,000 
people who live in Washington, D.C., 
which makes it more populous than 
the states of Vermont and Wyoming. 
People living in D.C. are citizens, pay 
taxes and serve in the military, yet they 
lack proper representation in Congress. 
Washington, D.C., has one non-voting 
delegate in the House of Representatives 
and no representatives in the Senate. 
This means that, despite being citizens 
of the United States, residents of D.C. 
do not have any voting representatives 
advocating 
for 
their 
interests 
in 

Congress.

Washington, D.C., also does not 

have control over many aspects of its 
local government because the federal 
government has almost unilateral 
control over it. The district cannot 
control its budget or pass legislation 
without approval from Congress. The 
role that the federal government plays 
in D.C. has been demonstrated through 
recent National Guard responses. In all 
other states and territories, the governor 
can call up the National Guard during 
times of crisis. However, in Washington, 
D.C., the National Guard is controlled 
by the executive branch, specifically the 
president. 

During 
the 
violent 
Jan. 
6 

insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, D.C. 
Mayor Muriel Bowser wanted to 
call in the D.C. National Guard to 
assist capitol police in subduing the 
violence. However, former President 
Donald Trump refused to send in the 
D.C. National Guard. The fact that 
citizens of D.C. who are serving their 
nation in the National Guard were 
not allowed to protect one of their 
district’s most important landmarks 
is reprehensible and demonstrates 

the lack of autonomy that D.C. should 
rightfully enjoy. 

Washington, 
D.C.’s 
lack 
of 

representation has often been referred 
to as a clear form of disenfranchisement 
against minority voters. Over 50% of 
the residents of Washington, D.C., are 
people of color, with 46% being Black 
or African American. Bowser recently 
mentioned the statehood issue in 
relation to the demographics of the city, 
saying statehood is “one of the remaining 
glaring civil rights issues of our time.”

Past attempts to establish D.C. as a 

state have been thwarted by Republicans 
in Congress. During a recent hearing 
on statehood, many Republicans in 
Congress came up with bizarre reasons to 
argue why D.C. should not be made into a 
state. Some claimed that D.C. did not have 
a car dealership or landfill. Others argued 
that D.C. residents already have influence 
over members of Congress through their 
political lawn signs and bumper stickers. 
If this was indeed the case, you would 
think that the D.C. license plates, which 
read “no taxation without representation” 
would have already moved the needle on 
the statehood issue. 

Another colorful argument against 

statehood came from Sen. Mike Rounds, 
R-S.D., who argued that the Founding 
Fathers did not intend for D.C. to be a 
state when they created the country. 
This argument was especially comical 
given that South Dakota — the state 
that Rounds represents — was also not 
around when the U.S. was founded and 
is therefore not part of the Founding 
Fathers’ vision either.

A more serious argument against 

D.C. statehood is that voters in D.C. 
are overwhelmingly liberal, meaning 
turning D.C. into a state would likely 
lead to two more Democratic senators. 
This would help Democrats keep control 
of the Senate. While it is important 
to consider the partisan lean of D.C., 
a community’s political preference 
is no reason to deny it the right to be 
represented in its government.

It is ludicrous that there are 700,000 

people living mere miles from our 
Capitol who have no representation in 
an entire branch of our government 
or true control over their own local 
government. Politics and this issue must 
be addressed through the admission of 
D.C. as the 51st state.

For Isaiah Livers, time runs out

Student-athletes continue to vie with the NCAA for rights

Isaiah Livers stood on the bench in sweats, 

hands in his pockets and a long expression on 

his face. Michigan’s season was coming to its 

end and Livers could only watch helplessly as 

the waning moments of his collegiate career 

faded into the abyss. 

He dared to follow the arc of Franz Wagner’s 

last-second 3-point attempt, a heave that carried 

with it the Wolverines’ fate.

The shot fell short. Livers bowed his head. 

Two-and-a-half weeks earlier, on March 

12, Livers’s season had already ended. A well-

orchestrated Maryland fast break caught 

Livers, the lone man on defense, in an awkward 

position; he committed a foul and came up lame. 

He didn’t know it yet, but he had just suffered 

a stress fracture in his right foot, an injury 

that would ultimately require surgery and six 

months of rehabilitation.

A day later on March 13, Livers hunched 

forward in his chair, eyes darting around and 

eluding the camera. He walked through the 

aftermath of the injury — upon learning of the 

diagnosis, he couldn’t help but wonder if his 

collegiate career had reached its conclusion.

But Livers didn’t want to dwell on the 

possibility. 

“I don’t want people to write me off yet,” 

Livers insisted. “Still gonna rehab and work 

my butt off to get back with this team because I 

know we’re going to make a run and I’m gonna 

be there for it.” 

He was there, just not in the fashion he had 

hoped. Prior to Michigan’s clash with LSU in 

the Round of 32, Livers watched warm-ups 

from the bench, hands on his hips. While the 

starting lineups were introduced, he rocked 

back and forth, doling out high-fives. His spot 

came. The public address announcer sent the 

words “Brandon Johns Jr.” echoing throughout 

Lucas Oil Stadium. 

The end of the road is cruel for all college 

athletes, with only a select few fortunate enough 

to go out victorious. But there’s an extra layer of 

cruelty to Livers’s story, his career evaporating 

out of his control, forced to watch the seconds 

tick away from the sideline

“I can’t even imagine what Zay’s going 

through,” freshman center Hunter Dickinson 

said on March 13. “Seeing the work he put in 

ever since he decided he was gonna come back 

for his senior year, just coming into practice, I’d 

come an hour early and he’s already got a full 

sweat going in his workouts with the manager.” 

Livers geared early-morning workouts, 

post-practice film sessions and everything in 

between toward the same goal — winning a 

national championship. 

He dreamt about it alongside Jordan Poole, 

his freshman-year roommate and closest 

friend. They painted hypotheticals, envisioning 

themselves floating up a ladder on the first 

Monday night in April, scissors in hand, basking 

in their immortality. 

As freshmen, the pair fell one game short of 

living out their dream when Villanova drubbed 

Michigan in the national championship. After 

the loss, Livers sat deep in his locker, a Gatorade 

towel draped over his head. A few feet to his 

side, Poole did the same. 

Still, their youth played in their favor, three 

more hurrahs on the horizon. 

One by one, those years fizzled without 

glory. In 2019, Texas Tech stymied Michigan’s 

season to a screeching halt in the Sweet Sixteen. 

Last year, COVID-19 shelved the NCAA 

Tournament entirely, prompting Livers to 

contemplate his future. After testing the NBA 

Draft waters, he opted to return to Ann Arbor, 

the thought of winning a championship at the 

forefront of his decision. 

“I feel like I had some more to prove,” Livers 

told the NCAA’s Andy Katz in July. “The motto 

was, ‘unfinished business.’ One last ride with 

coach Howard and the boys.” 

Buoyed by Livers, Michigan seemed 

primed to make the ride a special one, a 

national championship certainly within 

the realm of possibility. If Gonzaga and 

Baylor were entrenched as 1a and 1b, the 

Wolverines established themselves as 1c, 

penciled into the Final Four. 

“It just shows that he was destined for 

this,” Poole told The Daily in February, 

a day after Livers netted 16 points in 

Michigan’s 79-57 demolition of No. 8 Iowa, 

a win that pushed the Wolverines to 17-1. 

“He’s built to carry a team, put a team on 

his back.

“ … Him being able to carry the team and put 

the team on his back, figure out anything that 

needs to be done in order for those guys to win 

and put themselves in the championship — he’s 

gonna make sure he gets that done.” 

After a junior season derailed by nagging 

injuries, he vowed to show “a new Isaiah.” And 

he did, improving his performance in every 

major statistical category, no longer merely the 

3-and-D player from his first two seasons.

The new Livers, a senior captain, became 

more vocal. He filled the leadership void left by 

Zavier Simpson, serving as the program’s public 

face both after losses and in more prevalent 

matters, like speaking out against racial injustice 

and the lack of compensation for college 

athletes.

On March 4, Michigan secured the outright 

Big Ten regular-season championship against 

Michigan State on Senior Night. During his 

portion of the postgame festivities, Livers 

walked across the court with tears in his eyes, 

shaking his head in disbelief; a moment that 

always seemed so far away had arrived. He 

hugged Juwan Howard. In the stands, John 

Beilein watched on with a smile.

Livers understood his career had reached its 

twilight. Yet, at the same time, all he aspired to 

achieve was laid in front of him. 

“I want the natty, too,” Livers said after the 

game, his voice exuding determination. “I got 

my outright, we’re going to win the Big Ten 

championship, have a March Madness run, 

fingers crossed, and go get that natty.” 

And it all seemed feasible until the injury. 

Livers’s career-long dream had not been 

put on hold; rather, at once, gone down the 

drain. 

“The world is full of possibilities,” Livers 

maintained the day after his injury. “You never 

know, I could be back out there.” 

But after Tuesday’s heartbreaking loss to 

UCLA, Livers’s career ended with a whimper 

and a limp. He hobbled into the tunnel and out 

of sight, a Wolverine one last time.

Just a day before March Madness 

started, the biggest NCAA event of the 

year, college basketball players tweeted out 

“#NotNCAAPropterty” in protest of the 

NCAA denying them the ability to profit out 

their name, image and likeness (NIL) and for 

their service on the court. 

NCAA President Mark Emmert and the 

rest of the organization had previously agreed 

to finally allow student-athletes to benefit from 

their talents and efforts. Nearly two years later, 

that promise is left unfilled.

Due to the delay, student-athletes continue 

to voice their frustrations.

“There’s really no reason why it can’t 

happen almost immediately,” former Michigan 

defensive back Hunter Reynolds told The Daily 

back in August. “In my opinion … they are 

trying to drag it as long as possible to … tone it 

down and keep as much control as possible, 

and by virtue, as much money as possible.”

The protest on Twitter prior to the NCAA 

Tournament was just one occurrence of 

the unrest players feel. The leaders of that 

movement — Michigan senior forward Isaiah 

Livers, Rutgers guard Geo Baker and Iowa 

guard Jordan Bohannon — did in fact meet 

with Emmert. But, little came of it.

“Our meeting was the same thing he’s doing 

in the public,” Bohannon told ESPN. “A lot of 

talk and he’s waiting on Congress to decide on 

legislation.”

The angst to get these rules passed is mainly 

rooted in the financial benefit — like getting 

a small piece of the $800 million pie that the 

NCAA Tournament generates — but there is 

more to it than that. Throughout the summer, 

student-athletes of every sport, race, gender 

and ethnicity pitched their support for racial 

equality. They used their social media and their 

platform to speak out. 

“Athletes need to learn they have a voice 

and don’t need to be suppressed, because 

they signed a contract to a university,” Livers 

told The Daily in November. “ … At the end of 

the day, people are always going to see us as 

athletes, so that’s why we need more athletes 

to speak up.”

Opinions on student-athletes varied widely, 

but it is not something new. For a while athletes 

have built their brands, whether it be on social 

media or through their play-styles on the court 

or field. 

“The days of ‘Shut Up and Dribble’ should 

be long, long gone,” Michigan Regent Jordan 

Acker (D) told The Daily. “The more that 

student-athletes are able to express themselves 

creatively, politically (or) whichever way they 

choose to use their platforms. I think it is really 

helpful.”

They did not need the approval of the 

NCAA to show their personality and stick out. 

Student-athletes are not requesting that. They 

simply want the support. 

When asked about what role the University 

of Michigan would play if NIL rules were 

passed, Acker simply responded that they 

would treat student-athletes the same way they 

treat any other student. 

He added: “Those of us who are lucky 

enough to have these sorts of platforms have 

to use them, in that way though, to make 

the student experience fairer because that’s 

ultimately (what) this is about. It’s not really 

about me. It’s about making sure that this 

system which is not fair becomes more fair.”

The University’s main mission is to support 

its students. Despite some differences in 

opinion among the administration, Acker 

stated that there is a “general consensus” 

of individuals — including President Mark 

Schlissel and Athletic Director Warde Manuel 

— to support the student-athlete community. 

The actual rules and laws are yet to be 

decided, but regardless, it is a priority to make 

them fair to all athletes no matter their sport, 

gender or ethnicity. 

“There’s going to have to be lots of discussion 

about how the money comes in and how do we 

make sure that we don’t create more ‘haves’ 

than ‘have nots,’ both from campus to campus, 

as well as within our own campus,” Acker said. 

“But ultimately, I think there are going to be 

different incentives and one of them is going 

to be creativity and that alone may balance the 

field a little bit.”

Name, image and likeness rules already 

passed in the NAIA and already showing 

positive results. 

For example, Aquinas College volleyball 

player Chloe Mitchell broke ground, earning 

the first sponsorship deal for $3,000 from a 

beverage company called Smart Cups. 

It is not a shattering amount but it is a 

start. Mitchell has already amassed over five 

thousand followers on YouTube, around 50 

thousand followers on Instagram and an 

astounding 2.6 million followers on TikTok. 

Her sponsorship with Smart Cups will 

barely make a dent in tuition, but as stated in 

the CNBC article, she hopes that eventually 

she can leverage her platform into paying for 

school and maybe even a career one day. 

ESPN estimates that top student-athletes 

could turn profit anywhere from a couple 

thousand dollars — like Mitchell — to even 

a million for the few top-tier athletes. Livers, 

Bohannon and Baker would likely fall in 

between $5-to-$20 thousand in ESPN’s 

estimation.

These rules have the potential to truly 

change the lives of student-athletes, financially 

and beyond. Without the NCAA’s help though,

Bakich and Paige stress the importance of diversity and inclusion

For redshirt junior right-hander Isaiah Paige, 

his playing career has already seen a plethora 

of highlights. During the 2019 campaign, the 

Michigan baseball team made it to the College 

World Series final, falling to Vanderbilt in three 

games. Paige started and lost game two, but he 

only allowed one run on three hits in four innings. 

More importantly though, he and his opponent, 

potential 2021 number one overall pick Kumar 

Rocker, made history that night for more than their 

on-field production, becoming the first two Black 

Americans pitchers to start in a College World 

Series final. 

Despite his achievement, Paige knows it was 

just the first step of many. 

“That’s a little bit of history that I was glad to 

be a part of,” Paige said in a discussion with the 

University of Michigan’s School of Kinesiology on 

Tuesday. “But, my view of baseball hasn’t changed 

at all. It doesn’t matter who I’m playing against 

or who I’m playing with, it’s all for the love of the 

game. I just want to give back to the game in any 

way I can.”

That is a sentiment that Wolverines’ coach Erik 

Bakich has emphasized, too.

“There’s a lot of people that talk and they 

don’t do jack squat,” Bakich said. “They just like 

to complain or to post. Isaiah is about action. 

We actually get out in the community; when 

we are allowed to have camps, we do bring 

underprivileged kids in here.”

For Bakich, success is predicated on far more 

than just wins and losses. He leads a program 

that prides itself on its off-field abilities as much 

as its on-field ones. He tries to produce young 

men who will make an impact for years to come, 

particularly in their communities. The team is a 

family that looks after one another and seems to 

genuinely care about making a difference.

The baseball program hopes to imbue those 

attributes in its athletes for life, creating a tight-

knit community focused on making those 

differences. And for Bakich, opening up those 

opportunities to people of color is something 

always on his mind.

From Bakich’s perspective, with all that 

baseball has to offer kids, it is unfortunate that so 

many children will never pick up a bat. For many 

lower-income families, little league is but a pipe 

dream.

“I think baseball is missing a huge opportunity 

to target some of the best future players,” Bakich 

said. “Kids that don’t even know that you could 

be making millions in baseball, because they’re 

forced to pick a different sport.

Baseball, like many sports in the United States, 

has fallen victim to the ever-growing funds of travel 

leagues. Many parents find themselves paying 

thousands of dollars so their kids can play. For 

some, this is nothing more than a mere hindrance. 

For others, it can alter their athletic courses forever.

“I think it’s ridiculous the cost of travel ball and 

some of these showcases,” Bakich said. “It negates 

opportunities for a lot of kids. We want to have a 

diverse roster and we want to provide as many 

opportunities for kids all over the country that we 

can.”

Diversity is probably not the first word that 

comes to mind when thinking about baseball. 

However, for many kids, seeing an inclusive roster 

could be the start of a career. Younger players 

must find role models to stimulate their love for 

the sport — just as Paige did when he was first 

starting. 

“As an outfielder at a younger age, I was always 

attracted to guys like Torii Hunter and Curtis 

Granderson,” Paige said. “How do you combat 

that when you look around the game and you 

don’t see anybody who looks like you?”

As Paige continues to succeed in Ann Arbor, he 

serves as a role model for other children who will 

one day want to be Paige the same way he once 

wanted to be Hunter or Granderson. 

With Bakich’s vision for his program, those 

dreams may become realities sooner rather than 

later.

Gabby Wilson’s floor routine is an 

excellent encapsulation of who she is 
as both an athlete and an advocate.

In her 90 seconds on the mat, 

Wilson dives into themes of race that 
would have been taboo to speak of, 
much less present in competition, as 
recently as a decade ago. And, all the 
while, she throws in powerful dance 
moves and athletically impressive 
tumbling passes which only serve to 
emphasize the overarching message of 
Black power that she seeks to convey. 

The sophomore describes her sharp 

movements during the second song of 
her routine, which is, appropriately, an 
instrumental from the Black Panther 
soundtrack, as showing how much 
more work Black Americans have to do 
to be at the same point as white people, 
and people in general. She then furthers 
her statement as the music transitions 
to an excerpt from the Us soundtrack, 
another movie which focuses on racial 
themes.

“And then the last part is kind of 

interesting, because in the movie Us, 
everyone has their doppelganger who 
is evil,” Wilson said. “And I think for 
me, that was something they were 
always trying to combat, and I feel like 
my doppelganger is what people want 
me to be, what they perceive me to be. 
I’m constantly trying to combat that 
and not let that just be me, and that’s 
what I’m showing in that section.”

These two messages, as well as 

the general air of self-proclaimed 
“confident, beautiful arrogance” and 
powerful movements and tumbling 
passes that Wilson incorporates into 
her routine lend an evocative quality 
to her routine that her final pose 
hammers home.

She leaves the audience one last 

reminder of her routine’s motif as she 
thrusts her closed fist toward the sky.

“It’s really symbolic because it’s at 

the end of the routine,” Wilson said. “I 
feel like if I had it in the middle, it would 
kind of be just glazed over, so I really like 

that it is literally the last pose. It’s saying, 
‘Even though my routine is over, this is a 
fight that I’m going to have to fight when 
I leave this arena, when I get off the 
floor, when I go to school, when I go to 
the grocery store.’ So it’s symbolic based 
on the fact that this fight isn’t over, even 
though my routine is over. It’s still a thing 
that we need to be conscious of.”

The moment Wilson makes her 

powerful closing statement is in and 
of itself a notable signal of progress in 
the wider world of sports, but it exists 
amid a long and checkered history of 
race in gymnastics.

Like nearly every sport at the college 

and professional level, gymnastics 
presided as a predominantly white 
sport for much of its history. Laws 
and customs of racial segregation 
in the U.S. kept opportunities out of 
the hands of Black Americans for 
decades, just as they did in every major 
sports league in the country. In 1966, 
Keith Coleman broke Michigan’s 
gymnastics color barrier, but this did 
little to move the meter in terms of 
sustained diversity.

The sport of gymnastics has a 

more troubled history than most; 
people of color didn’t reach the 
highest level until 1992. It is only then 
that Dominique Dawes and Betty 
Okino became the first two African-
American women to represent the 
United States at the Olympic games.

“I think that gymnastics was 

(primarily white) for a really long time 
because it is a relatively expensive 
sport,” Michigan coach Bev Plocki 
said. “It’s the lessons and the training, 
the uniforms and all the travel. The 
higher level you get the more travel 
there is, both across the United States, 
and, depending on how good you are, 
internationally.”

Things began to change, though, 

when Dawes and Okino tore down the 
Olympic color barrier.

In 
stepping 
onto 
the 
mat 

in Barcelona, the pair began a 
demographic shift that brought with it 
household names like Simone Biles and 
Gabby Douglas, as well as a number 
of collegiate gymnasts of color, but 

has not made as grand of an impact in 
percentages as the success of those like 
Biles and Douglas would suggest. Social 
structures of inertia have thus far kept 
gymnastics a predominantly white 
sport, and signs of change are only just 
starting to appear, as the percentage of 
Black collegiate gymnasts has increased 
from 4.5% to slightly under 10% in the 
last decade.

Despite the slow tides of progress, 

though, Wilson credits her presence 
to those women of color who have 
established themselves in the sport.

“It wasn’t even just like, ‘Okay, 

Gabby Douglas went to the Olympics, 
so I can win a national championship,’ 
” Wilson said. “That’s not even how I 
thought about it. But it was more so 
seeing them do what they’re doing and 
being successful at it; I didn’t have a 
reason to think that I couldn’t do it. 

“I think that’s more so where 

empowerment comes from, because I 
was the only Black person on my team 
several times and for several years 
in a row, but even in that, I do think 
subconsciously because of gymnasts 
like Simone Biles, Dominique Dawes, 
Gabby Douglas, I didn’t feel like I didn’t 
belong. I didn’t feel like I couldn’t be as 
successful as other girls.”

***

Wilson credits those who came 

before her for enabling her to reach 

the heights that she has — a prominent 
figure on a top-five team in Division 
I gymnastics — but this humble 
statement belies the trailblazing 
qualities of what Wilson does with her 
position. While most in gymnastics 
see the floor exercise as a place for 
expression and individualism, Wilson 
is among the first, if not the very first, 
in the NCAA to incorporate such a 

direct and powerful social message 
into her routine, according to Plocki. 
And this makes a great deal of sense 
when one looks at what Wilson does 
when she is off the mat.

In talking about Wilson’s off-the-

mat actions, both Plocki and assistant 
coach and floor routine choreographer 
Maile’ana Kanewa-Hermelyn rush 
to praise a video Wilson recorded 
talking about current racial issues in 
the United States.

“I am so proud of not only Gabby, 

but Sierra (Brooks) and many other 
members of our team, as well, for 
some of the statements they’ve made,” 
Plocki said. “But, in particular, Gabby 
made an incredible video that I just 
thought was unbelievably outstanding. 
She did it all on her own, and it was an 
incredible message.”

Beyond even this high praise, 

Plocki’s decision to nominate Wilson 
to serve as a representative on the 
NCAA 
Diversity 
Committee 
for 

Women’s 
Gymnastics 
signifies 

Wilson’s commitment to social justice. 
The nomination occurred this past 
summer, during heightened tensions in 
the wake of George Floyd’s death. Such 
a situation clearly called for thoughtful, 
insightful voices to take the NCAA 
forward on a better path as the United 
States experienced a racial reckoning. 

Wilson did not disappoint.
“The feedback that I’ve gotten from 

my other coaching colleagues that are 
on that committee is that she’s been 
unbelievable as one of the student-
athlete representatives,” Plocki said. 
“And so I really applaud her and I’m 
very, very proud of her for the stance that 
she’s taken and the thoughtfulness and 
the passion that she’s put into all of this.”

The way Plocki sees it, this comes 

as no surprise.

Wilson raises the Black Power 

fist at the end of her floor routine 
because she is an advocate, through 
and through. And while she would be 
quick to point out that she is one in a 
growing line of Black women carving 
out their place in gymnastics, she goes 
to extraordinary lengths, both on and 
off the mat, to see that place expand.

In 2020, Gabby Wilson was one of 

just 102 Black female gymnasts among 
a total of 1,087 competitors, but she 
delivers a message true to herself in 
hopes of inspiring other women of 
color to feel confident in expressing 
themselves through gymnastics.

***

Wilson’s actions off the mat 

certainly exist in the larger trend of 
athlete and student-athlete pushes for 
social justice, but her actions on the 
mat lie within a greater trend as well.

According to Plocki, the range 

of expression available to student-
athletes in their floor routines has 
widely expanded in recent years. 
Remembering a time when all 
routine music was played by an 
in-house pianist, Plocki explains that 
the relatively recent introduction 
of full instrumentals has broadened 
the musical selections available to 
student-athletes in a way that allows 
for diversity of messages as well. In a 

bygone time where piano music was 
the only option available to gymnasts, 
Wilson’s routine would not have been 
possible, but modern liberty over music 
choice allows her to make a statement. 

“In college, it’s a lot about 

entertainment, 
but 
also 
about 

being a role model and spreading 
really positive messages,” Kanewa-
Hermelyn said. “I think it’s awesome 
that they don’t have to do it in an 
interview, to talk about what the 
message they’re trying to get across or 
the statement they’re trying to make. 
They don’t have to do that verbally, 
they can do it through their dancing 
and their emotion.”

As the saying goes, actions speak 

louder than words. 

“It’s 
not 
just 
dance, 
it’s 
a 

performance,” 
Kanewa-Hermelyn 

said. “It is a message and it is their own. 
It’s their voice.”

And in cases like these where the 

messages can reaffirm somebody’s 
value of and belief in themself, they 
can have powerful effects.

“I think you see a lot of hype around 

that on social media with different 
routines from different universities 
really spreading positive messages,” 
Kanewa-Hermelyn said. “They give 
the younger gymnasts and the younger 
athletes something to look up to and 
look forward to to be able to create their 
vision of what they’re going to want to 
be one day as a college gymnast.”

***

As college gymnastics becomes a 

more and more diverse space, routines 
like Wilson’s give further push to that 
trend by staking a claim for people of 
different backgrounds in the landscape 
of gymnastics. People of more and 
more backgrounds will see a place for 
themselves in the sport as they have 
role models to look up to that represent 
their experience and show them the 
power of being themselves. 

And in that way, when Wilson 

thrusts her fist into the air in each 
of Michigan’s meets, she does for a 
younger generation of Black American 
gymnasts the same thing that Dawes, 
Douglas and Biles did for her.

ALLISON ENGKVIST/Daily 

Michigan sophomore Gabby Wilson is using her floor routine to speak to who 
she is as a Black woman.

The Michigan softball team has been 

predictable. 

Most games are headlined by star 

pitchers Alex Storako and Meghan 
Beaubien. And while the Wolverines often 
squeak out a win with just enough runs 
to outscore their opponent, the offense 
isn’t normally something to marvel over. 
Batters make contact and get on base, but 
there is rarely the power to send them 
across home plate. It’s been the same story 
for years. 

But this weekend, the offense proved it 

had it in them. It outscored Ohio State by a 
margin of 23-4 across a slate of four games 
in which No. 23 Michigan took three of 
four from the Buckeyes.

Those runs weren’t scored on bloops 

in the gap, sacrifice bunts nor standard 
singles, rather a majority of them came 
via homeruns. The Wolverines launched 
seven homers over the course of the series 
in Columbus, which is half of the total 

homeruns the team has hit this season. 

“Well, you know, hitting is contagious 

so once you bust it open, I mean, it was 
just kind of like a domino effect after that,” 
senior first baseman Lou Allan said. “I 
think that we just were really focusing on 
trying to hit the ball hard, and that was the 
whole kind of what the game plan was. We 
wanted to hit the ball as hard as we could, 
and really focus on that.”

The team certainly struck with power, 

with Allan at the forefront. She hit one over 
the fence all three days of the series and in 
three out of the four games. Allan walked 
away with four hits and five RBIs on the 
weekend, bringing her OPS up to .976 on 
the year, second behind junior outfielder 
Lexie Blair.

Blair had a strong weekend herself, 

nabbing at least one hit in each game of 
the series, extending her hitting streak 
to 20 games — all of this year’s games — 
including her own homer on Sunday.

The biggest hit in the series came in the 

most lopsided game, one where Michigan 
found itself winning 11-0 with three total 
homeruns. The hit was delivered by senior 

infielder Taylor Bump, who launched the 
ball far past the fence and into the wall of 
the building adjacent to the field.Bump has 
been banking on this type of a weekend 
for a while now, putting her faith in her 
teammates to come through.

“Our Strong Girls, and I’m one of them, 

we’re supposed to hit the ball far and that’s 
expected from us. We’re supposed to hit 
the ball hard,” Bump said two weeks ago.

On who the “Strong Girls” are on the 

team, Bump had more than just a few 
names:

“Lou Allan, Hannah Carson, Lexie Blair, 

Keke Tholl, who is a young freshman, but 
can hit, she can hit for some power. Sierra 
Kersten, obviously, can drive the ball. Haley 
Hoogenraad can get a hold of the ball. Juju 
(Julia) can get a hold of the ball too.”

As for homeruns this weekend, Allan? 

Check. Blair? Check. Sophomore infielder 
Julia Jimenez? Check. 

Junior catcher Carson walked away 

with two doubles on the weekend, and 
Kersten walked away with a double as 
well. All in all, the “Strong Girls” showed 
up to hit.

It wasn’t all home runs and power 

hitting, though, as Michigan lost Saturday 
afternoon is a less-than-stellar showing.

“That game was on the offense. Because 

Meghan pitched her heart out,” Michigan 
coach Carol Hutchins said.

Still, this past weekend was an 

improvement for the Wolverines, whose 
key to success going forward just might be 
a group of really strong girls.

Through her floor routine, Wilson finds her passion and voice

Michigan’s ‘Strong Girls’ power through road series

ALEC COHEN/Daily 

Michigan first basewoman Lou Allan showed her 

power over the weekend.

Redshirt junior outfielder Danny Zimmerman stepped 

into the box and uncorked a missile over the wall in left 
field for a three-run home run. Zimmerman broke open the 
inning, plating three of the nine runs scored in the frame.

The No. 25 Michigan baseball team routed Ohio State 

behind a balanced and explosive offense.

The Wolverines recorded 17 hits in total, and nearly the 

entire lineup contributed to the damage. Eleven different 
batters reached base, with 10 of them recording a hit and 
11 of them scoring.

“There were just a lot of guys having quality at-bats,” 

Michigan coach Erik Bakich said. “Our offense is very 
capable of exploding for a lot of runs.”

Graduate transfer infielder Christian Molfetta led 

the way offensively, collecting a walk to go with three 
hits, including a solo blast to left field in the fifth inning. 
Graduate transfer catcher Griffin Mazur also notched two 
hits and a walk. Zimmerman pinch-hit for sophomore 
infielder Ted Burton in the fifth inning and lifted the team 
with a walk and two hits, including his three-run shot in 
the eighth inning.

“We’ve had a lot of big innings throughout the year and 

that was our biggest one so far,” Bakich said. “The guys 
were just finding ways to get on base. Not trying to do 
too much, just guys getting on and running the bases, one 
quality at-bat after the next.”

The Wolverines also got significant production from the 

bottom of the order, with sophomore outfielder Clark Elliott 
picking up two hits and a walk and sophomore outfielder 
Tito Flores getting a hit and a walk. Junior infielder Riley 
Bertram also recorded a hit and a walk and Flores recorded 
a sacrifice fly while Bertram laid down a sacrifice bunt.

“We’re trying to just pass the baton, string quality at-bats 

together and good things will happen,” Zimmerman said. 
“Just trying to hit the ball hard, get on base, stuff like that. 
And that’s exactly what we did.”

Redshirt sophomore outfielder Jordon Rogers also got 

in on the action, notching two hits and a walk. Graduate 
transfer Benjamin Sems, who later left the game with an 
injury, came up with a timely bases-loaded single to give 
Michigan a 2-1 lead in the third, a lead which Michigan 
would never relinquish.

“The guys just go up there trying to have hard contact,” 

Bakich said. “In the last couple of days, there’s been such 
a high priority on competing pitch to pitch, I just felt like 
the guys were really locked in, giving their best effort, their 
best focus.”

After racing out to a 4-0 lead in the first 

set, fifth-year Connor Johnston coasted to 
a 6-3 victory over Michigan State’s Jarreau 
Campbell. But the second set was a far 
different story as Campbell came out ultra-
aggressive, ripping serves at Johnston. 

As the two players traded blows, it was 

Johnston who delivered the knockout 
punch, breaking Campbell’s serve and 
volleying his way to a 6-4 second-set 
victory.

Johnston’s 6-3, 6-4 victory fueled the 

No. 17 Michigan men’s tennis team (13-2 
overall, 13-1 Big Ten) to a 7-0 shutout 
over the Spartans (5-11, 5-9) at the Varsity 
Tennis Center. It was the fourth shutout 
in a row for the Wolverines.

“This sounds counterintuitive, but I 

tried to go after his hard serves,” Johnston 
said. “If you let him come after you, he’s 
going to stay aggressive. I took two steps 
back and tried to be aggressive and go 
after his serves.”

Johnston was not alone in strategically 

countering Michigan State’s aggressive 
play with finesse at the baseline and 
strong groundstrokes. At No. 2 doubles, 
Michigan State’s Reed Crocker and Drew 
Keene relentlessly charged the net. Senior 
brothers Kristofer and Mattias Siimar 
utilized pinpoint lobs and passing shots to 
dominate, 6-2.

“They had great control of the ball,” 

Michigan coach Adam Steinberg said. 
“When they have a target, something to 
hit through, they’re tough. If you come in, 
you better bring something extraordinary 
or else they’re going to beat you through 
the middle, they’re going to dip the ball, or 
they’re going to be able to lob.”

Johnston 
and 
freshman 
Nino 

Ehrenschneider followed up with a 6-2 
victory of their own, securing the doubles 
point for the Wolverines. Ehrenschneider 
followed his doubles performance with 
a swift 6-0, 6-1 victory over Michigan 
State’s Luke Baylis at No. 5 singles, 
pushing Michigan’s lead to 2-0.

Freshman Jacob Bickersteth put on 

a groundstroke clinic at No. 4 singles, 
defeating Graydon Lair, 6-0, in the first set, 
highlighted by a backhand winner at set-
point. Unforced errors from Bickersteth 
allowed Lair to stick around in the second 
set, but Bickersteth kept his composure en 
route to a 6-3 victory in the second. 

After a dominant first set victory, 

senior Nick Beaty found himself down 
3-2 in his second set, struggling with a 
strong serving performance from Josh 
Mukherjee at No. 3 singles. But Beaty was 
able to serve his way back to 4-4, before 
grinding out a 6-4 victory to take the 
match for the Wolverines. 

“I thought he served great today,” 

Steinberg said. “He always fights as hard 
as he can. I thought on the return game 
he was inconsistent in the second set, but 

his serve helped him a ton because he was 
holding easily and serving really well.”

At No. 1 singles, Michigan State’s Nick 

Williams was hitting huge serves and 
took every opportunity he had to rush 
the net against junior Andrew Fenty. 
Yet Fenty’s debilitating returns never let 
Williams gain control. 

“(Fenty) hit some incredible returns,” 

Steinberg 
said. 
“(Williams) 
started 

missing his first serve because of it, (and 
he) was trying to overhit. With (Fenty) 
you really have to hit your spots and serve 
the right way otherwise he’s going to 

hurt you on the return for sure. He turns 
defense into offense quickly.”

In a match in which Michigan didn’t 

drop a single set, the one moment of 
adversity was the weather forcing the 
match inside, just after Michigan had 
gained some momentum from winning 
the doubles point. 

Judging by the score, however, the 

Wolverines didn’t miss a beat.

“I don’t think it hurt us at all,” Steinberg 

said. “The guys were super excited about 
this match. Indoors, outdoors, it didn’t 
matter.”

Michigan dismantles MSU in fourth straight shutout

KATE HUA/Daily 

Connor Johnston’s 6-3, 6-4 victory fueled the No. 17 Michigan men’s tennis team against 
MSU.


After eight innings, senior left-hander Meghan 

Beaubien stepped off the rubber. The biomedical 
engineering student walked off the field with her 
fifth collegiate complete game no-hitter, this time 
with an extra inning tacked on. The 2-1 credited 
win over Nebraska marked her 73rd as a Wolverine, 
surpassing Kelly Kovach for ninth-most in Michigan 
history.

Beaubien’s work on the diamond was over for the 

day, but she still had work in three classes — senior 
design, upper level occupational biomechanics and 
advanced math for engineers — to look forward to. 
For most student athletes, let alone students, such 
a schedule would cause anxiety by just looking at 
it. Beaubien, though, considers this not only a light 
course load, but one of the easiest semesters she’s had 
in college.

Being a pitcher that understands high level 

engineering, mathematics and biology has its 
advantages. It gives Beaubien a deeper understanding 
of why a ball spins, what makes it move, how she can 
generate the most force off the ground and what push 
off angle allows her to throw the hardest ball possible.

It’s also a large reason why Beaubien describes 

pitching the way she can.

“I don’t want a high angle with the ground, and I 

want (my front foot) as low to the ground as possible,” 
Beaubien said. “If I want to be technical about this, 
that’s because if we’re imagining a force vector from 
that drive foot, from my left foot, if it’s going too far 
up then I’m wasting force and wasting energy in 
the vertical direction when I want to maximize the 
horizontal force.”

Her intellectual perspective isn’t overlooked by 

Beaubien’s coaches either, who embrace and adapt 
their coaching to fit her unique approach.

“It is fun to have a mind like Meghan’s because 

most students and even coaches don’t speak the same 
way Meghan does,” Michigan associate head coach 
Bonnie Tholl said. “The terminology’s different, the 
vernacular is different.”

Michigan pitching coach Jennifer Brundage 

asks Beaubien questions instead of telling her what’s 
wrong. She’s learned that having Beaubien solve the 
problem in her head or out loud is a way to facilitate 
her learning and adjustment. Essentially, Brundage 
prompts Beaubien to find the solution herself, 
which is not the way she approaches coaching other 
pitchers.

When asked about Beaubien’s biomechanical 

view of softball, junior catcher Hannah Carson 

chuckled before responding.

“She is very analytical,” Carson said. “So when you 

start to talk to her about how pitches move and the 
trajectory of the pitch, sometimes she’ll start talking 
to me and I don’t even know what she’s saying. Like 
she’ll start talking about angles and speed, and then I 
just have to be like ‘OK, yeah. That one just seemed a 
little bit faster than the one before.’ ”

Beaubien’s fellow pitcher, and the right hook to her 

left, junior Alex Storako, called Beaubien’s method 
“hilarious” before going into how she and Beaubien 
approach pitching problems differently. Storako 
called Beaubien mechanical and analytical, while 
stating her own style relies more on how things look 
and feel.

Mechanical and analytical is the most accurate 

description of not only how Beaubien comes at 
softball, but how she goes through life. 

***

It was a Sunday morning in Newport, Michigan. 
Jason Beaubien sat at the helm of the vehicle with 

his hands on the steering wheel, eyes on the road and 
over four hours of driving ahead of him. Newport to 
Chicago, every weekend, and all for his 14-year-old 
daughter sitting in the backseat. She wanted to play 
on the best travel team she could, and that meant long 
hours on I-94.

Typically, a long car ride might offer a parent a 

chance to bond or spend some time talking with their 
otherwise-busy daughter. At least that’s what other 
people told Jason.

“For us,” Jason said. “… There was no time.”
Instead, Meghan had her books sprawled out 

across the car and her eyes locked in on the pages. She 
had a four-hour practice in front of her and another 
long drive back home to end the day. She didn’t have 
much time during the week either, so this was her 
opportunity to study and do her homework, and she 
was determined to get it done.

Though it made for some lonely drives, that 

behavior is exactly what Jason and Kim Beaubien 
preached to their daughter.

Each day, Meghan would go out to her uncle’s 

barn to pitch, driven to get better, and every day her 
father would catch for her. But first, there were some 
questions.

When do you want to go pitch? How much 

homework do you have? When are you going to do it?

“They kind of held that standard,” Meghan said. 

“Like, ‘OK, well we’re not going to go pitch if your 
homework isn’t done, but at the same time, you know 
you’re on travel softball teams. You’re expected to get 
your pitching in.’ ”

In the Beaubien household, academics weren’t an 

afterthought. Both Meghan and her younger brother, 
Matt, were held to a high standard. That didn’t mean 
they needed all A’s, but they needed to do their best.

So Meghan did her best.
That included studying on car rides, homework 

before pitching and working late at night.

“She was so busy with her academics, and even in 

high school it would be routine for her to be up to one, 
two o’clock in the morning getting her homework 
done,” Jason said.

It turned out that when Meghan tried her best, 

even though all A’s weren’t expected of her, she 
got them. Through middle school she breezed by, 
receiving perfect marks without much effort. In 
high school at Saint Mary Catholic Central, Meghan 
graduated in 2017 as valedictorian with a 4.7 GPA and 
a 34 on the ACT while taking every AP class that fit 
into her schedule.

Her academic success never slowed down her 

progress on the softball field. Meghan posted 
outstanding individual achievements including 
Michigan Gatorade Player of the Year and FloSoftball 
First Team All-American in 2015, as well as the two 
years after that. Additionally, she was a four-time 
Michigan All-State selection with a 100-11 career 
record and 1,442 strikeouts, becoming the FloSoftball 
No. 6 overall recruit in the country.

On the team side, Meghan also found success. She 

left high school as a three-time state champion and 
a two-year team captain. In 2016, she tossed back-
to-back perfect games in the state semifinal and 
championship games. With the Beverly Bandits, her 
travel ball team, Meghan won the 16U PGF National 
Championship in 2016 and was runner up in 2015.

At the end of it all, she had a smattering of D1 offers 

to choose from. For her decision, it came back to 
academics.

“When I was being recruited, I wrote out … 

colleges that would be kind of on my dream list,” 
Meghan said. “My top two criteria were how’s their 
softball program, and how are they academically. 
And honestly, I might say that academics were 
weighted maybe even a little higher than the softball 
program.”

So when it came time for Meghan to decide on her 

commitment, Michigan came out as a clear winner. 
It was a place where she wouldn’t have to sacrifice 
either one of her passions to pursue the other. 

A place that let Meghan keep being Meghan.
“She was just a kid that loved school,” Jason said. 

“It’s strange to say, but she loves school and she loves 
softball. … and I think that’s molded her into the 
young lady she is.”

***

“I got to college and I was like, ‘Oh wait, I’m not as 

smart as I thought I was,’ ” Beaubien said.

Because as smart as she is, her academic and 

athletic success is more a product of her effort and 
organization than her inherent intelligence. 

Because of this wake-up call, something countless 

students at Michigan have experienced, Beaubien 
plans her entire week out down to the hour. She 
knows when she needs to leave for practice, when 
to go to a meeting, when she’s going to start an 
assignment — one that is often not even due until over 
a week later — and when she’s going to hang out with 
friends. 

Planning, though, is one thing. Following through 

and excelling at it is another. That’s where all the 
lessons about balance and hard work Beaubien 
learned when she was younger pays off.

“She’s the kind of kid that you have to reign her in 

a little bit,” Brundage said. “If I didn’t put a maximum 
number of pitches on a workout for her, she would 
throw too much all the time because she’s just a 
workhorse that way. You can tell her work ethic. She’s 
not afraid of hard work and she’s not afraid to put in 
the hours.”

That’s more emblematic of Beaubien than 

anything else. Not her GPA or valedictorian status. 
Not her no-hitters or total strikeouts. Not her state 
championships or player of the year awards. It’s her 
work ethic and drive to do her best no matter what.

“No one was tougher on Meghan than Meghan,” 

Jason said. “She was very determined, whether it was 
studying for a math exam, or winning a spelling bee. 
… No matter what it was, she was just determined to 
win and be the best she could be and that carried her.”

Whatever obstacle stands in front of her, Beaubien 

keeps going. Trying, analyzing and trying again 
until she has it down to a science. That’s Beaubien’s 
approach. That’s her method.

Michigan senior left-hander Meghan Beaubien uses 
her analytical mind in both softball and school work.

With 12 College World Series 

appearances, and winners of the first 
national championship east of the 
Mississippi River in 2005, Michigan 
softball 
has 

earned 
its 

reputation as a 
storied program. 
Its 
postseason 

results 
since 

the graduation 
of 
legendary 

infielder Sierra 
Romero in 2016, 
though, may not 
show it. 

The Wolverines have consistently 

dominated the Big Ten since then. 
They have held at least a share of 
the 
regular-season 
conference 

championship in 11 of the last 12 
seasons, with the only blemish being 
a second-place finish in 2017. Early on, 
Michigan looks on pace to continue 
its in-conference success. It currently 
stands at 16-4, winners of 10 out of its 
last 11 games heading into its home-
opener against Michigan State. 

It’s in the postseason where things 

have gotten tricky.

In the three postseasons since 

their 2016 College World Series 
run, the Wolverines have failed to 
advance past the regional stage, 
including the most recent NCAA 
tournament in 2019 where they lost 
to James Madison on their very own 
Alumni Field. For an ordinary softball 
program, three consecutive NCAA 
regional appearances is nothing to 
look down upon.

Michigan coach Carol Hutchins 

does not run an ordinary softball 
program. 

With over 1600 wins, Hutchins 

entered this season as the winningest 
D1 softball coach in history. Since 
leading the Wolverines to their first 

College World Series appearance in 
1995, in only their third trip to the 
NCAA Tournament, Michigan has 
not missed the playoffs. 

These last three years mark the 

longest super-regional drought the 
Wolverines have ever endured since 
becoming postseason staples in 1995. 
Add in the pandemic-shortened 2020 
campaign, and Michigan is at a point 
by-far furthest removed from playoff 
success in the last quarter century.

Stuck 
on 
being 
consistently 

good for almost a half-decade, the 
Wolverines are now at an inflection 
point. They have what it takes, within 
their current roster, to take the 
program back to the College World 
Series. To be great. 

They just haven’t shown it yet. 
They have shown bits and pieces 

of a formula destined for success, 
one seen in the likes of the 2013-2016 
teams, when Michigan went to the 
College World Series in three out of 
four years, the 2009 College World 
Series squad or the 2005 National 
Champions. 

Those bits and pieces include one 

of the most dynamic pitching-duos 
in the nation: junior right-hander 
Alex Storako and senior left-hander 
Meghan Beaubien. Together, along 
with three innings of support from 
senior right-hander Sarah Schaefer, 
they have propelled the Wolverines 
to a nation-leading .90 ERA, and have 
placed Michigan as the only program 
in the country to hold a team ERA 
under one. 

That’s not only dominant, it’s 

a proven recipe for success. The 
pitching rotation has held batters to a 
.158 batting average so far this season. 
That number is a full .28 points below 
the average opponent batting average 
of Michigan’s last five College World 
Series teams and is on-par with the 

2005 champions’ numbers. 

“Our pitchers have done a fantastic 

job of doing their part,” Hutchins said. 
“They keep us in every game, we’ve 
had a chance to win every game we’ve 
played.” 

When it comes to a formula that 

can return the Wolverines to an 
elite national program, as opposed 
to a consistent Big Ten powerhouse, 
pitching is certainly found in the 
equation. So is fielding. When batters 
do make contact with balls thrown 
by Beaubien or Storako — a relatively 
rare occurrence as they both sit 
in the top nine in the nation for 
strikeouts per game — the balls make 
it to a defensive unit boasting a top-25 
fielding percentage.

With such success on one side of 

the ball, the question turns to where 
Michigan can go to become elite 
once again: What’s missing from this 
team’s equation that teams from years 
past have had? 

The answer runs deeper than 

just to hit better, it lies in whether 
or not the Wolverines actually have 
an attainable path to providing 
enough run-support to make use of 
Beaubien and Storako’s elite skill-sets 
postseason play is the real question at 
hand.

Luckily for Michigan, they do. As 

the game of softball evolves towards 
an 
emphasis 
on 
power-hitting, 

a common argument has been 
Michigan’s inability to keep up with 
the changes. However, recently, the 
Wolverines’ bats have shown serious 
pop. Over the past weekend at Ohio 
State, for example, they blasted seven 
home runs, and are now tied for third 
in the Big Ten with 14. 

Obviously, no conversation about 

the Michigan offense can take place 
without mentioning junior outfielder 
Lexie Blair. No matter how the 

offensive unit as a whole has played, 
Blair has consistently delivered. She’s 
recorded at least a hit in all 20 games 
this season, and boasts an astounding 
.478 batting average. That’s even 
higher than Romero’s average in 2016, 
when she led the Wolverines’ last 
College World Series team in batting. 

“Is she one of the best hitters here 

at Michigan ever? She’s definitely in 
that conversation,” associate head 
coach Bonnie Tholl said. “Anytime 
she steps into the box, you can expect 
something exciting to happen.”

That 2016 team, the last team to 

reach what has been a standard for 
the program, had productive sticks up 
and down the lineup. They had three 
batters hit over .400 on the season, 
and their entire starting lineup hit at 
least at a .300 clip. 

To make it back to the College 

World Series, the 2021 team doesn’t 
need to match the batting averages 
of teams that made it to the World 
Series before them in order to reach 
that elite level themselves. They have 

a historically dominant pitching 
tandem, all they need to do is seize 
the potential that the current lineup 
holds, and the promised land can 
return to sight for the Wolverines. 

The improvement doesn’t have 

to be dramatic. With the offensive 
surge last weekend against Indiana, 
Michigan showed promise up and 
down its lineup. The team has 
already brought its previously-
dismal team batting average up 
to .302, and now have five batters 
hitting north of .295. 

“We are upward trending in 

offense,” Hutchins said on March 
28. “And again, once again, hitting 
becomes contagious.” 

As they gain momentum in the 

batter’s box, those numbers aren’t 
too far off from the 2015 team, who 
lost in the College World Series final 
to Florida in three games. Their 
pitching tandem, meanwhile, held a 
1.74 ERA, far higher than Beaubien’s 
and Storako’s. 

As opposed to praying for a 

miraculous upsurge in hitting, where 
the entire team is batting over .300 for 
example, in order to play elite softball, 
the Wolverines just need further 
in-season 
improvements 
from 

players already starting to get hot. 
This includes senior infielder Natalia 
Rodriguez. She entered the series 
against Indiana batting .231 and ninth 
in the lineup. She now hits .309 and 
watches leadoff-hitter Blair from the 
on-deck circle. A continued upswing 
from her can provide a lethal one-
two punch that will produce ample 
support for Michigan pitchers. 

Pair Rodriguez with batters like 

senior first baseman Lou Allan, who 
smashed three home runs over the 
weekend, and the offense begins to 
take shape. Add in a crop of young 
Wolverine hitters that are getting more 
and more comfortable with gained 
experiences, such as sophomore Julia 
Jimenez whose batting average has 
swelled to .295 and continues to rise, 
and all-of-a-sudden this Michigan 
team starts to look like the dominant 
ones of years past. 

“We’re working our offense hard,” 

Hutchins said. “What they can do 
better is just focus on their one-pitch 
moment, and that’s all we can ask of 
them.” 

Whether the offense will continue 

to improve remains in question. 

Michigan softball is at a crossroads 

between being Big Ten bullies 
and national stars. They’re at an 
intersection 
between 
a 
quarter 

century of continued success and a 
future that is far from certain. They 
have the missing link in their grasp: 
a roster beaming with potential, a 
roster capable of steering the program 
back toward consistent appearances 
in softball’s biggest stage. Toward 
greatness. 

They just have to harness it.

analytical approach to softball

Michigan has the talent, can it end a super regional drought?

Michigan fails to 
capitalize on early 

scoring run

After a 20-9 defeat against Maryland on Feb. 20, the Michigan 

men’s lacrosse team looked to even the season series on Saturday. 

Against the nation’s second-ranked squad, Michigan needed a fast 

start to assert itself and send Maryland a message that it came to play. 
That message was delivered early by the Wolverines as they jumped 
to a 5-0 lead seven minutes into the game. Michigan’s quick start saw 
it play its best team lacrosse all season, forcing the Terrapins into their 
largest deficit of the year. 

But then it fell apart. The Wolverines (2-6 Big Ten) failed to finish, 

falling 18-12 to No. 2 Maryland (8-0). 

It didn’t take long before the Terrapins flipped the switch. They 

proceeded to go on a blistering 16-0 scoring run while flexing their 
defensive mettle, holding the Wolverines’ offense off the scoreboard 
for 27 minutes. 

“We’ve got to stop the runs,” Michigan coach Kevin Conry said. 

“The most important thing that we can do is come out of the third 
quarter with some fire. … If you’re not dialed in 100% of the time — 
and the most disciplined team on the field, the most physical team on 
the field, the most attentive to all the details — you will lose. We lost 
because we gave up those runs.”

During that run, Maryland maintained possession and kept the 

ball out of the Wolverines’ hands. Michigan began the game with a 
9-2 shot differential. By the time the game ended, though, Maryland 
dominated in shots, outpacing the Wolverines 39-23. 

“We gave them an outlet, and we allowed them to find out who they 

were again: The No. 2 team in the country,” Conry said. “When you 
play Maryland, and if you want to beat them, you have to over execute 
for sixty minutes. And in that twenty-seven minutes, they had the ball 
and we couldn’t make a stop. Maryland was over executing, and we 
were not meeting our standards.” 

Michigan appeared to regain momentum late in the game by going 

on a 7-2 run, but the Terrapins’ earlier burst proved to be too much for 
the Wolverines to overcome. 

Maryland’s offensive surge was keyed by arguably the best player 

in the country in senior attackman Jared Bernhardt. During its 
16-0 scoring run, Bernhardt netted five goals while assisting on two 
others. His off-ball presence made it very difficult for defenders to 
predict his move.

“He’s one of the best players in the country for a reason,” junior 

defenseman Andrew Darby said. “He is an unbelievable player, and he 
works really hard. Going up against him is definitely a good learning 
experience for us. We tried different things to stop him. I love to play 
against players that good because it can only make you better.” 

Key contributors to this game included junior attackman Bryce 

Clay, who knotted a hat trick and an assist, and sophomore attackman 
Josh Zawada, who tallied two goals and three assists for the day.

On Saturday, the Wolverines hung with one of the nation’s best 

programs. Despite a valiant effort, Conry’s squad will need far more 
than moral victories as the season reaches its apex.
