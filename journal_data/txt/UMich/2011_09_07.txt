precautions to curb
student drinking
By PAIGE PEARCY
Daily Staff Reporter
Tickets for Saturday night's
football game against Notre
Dame sold out faster than any
game in Michigan's history.
And though the entire campus
community is excited about the
historic sporting event, Univer-
sity officials are also concerned
about drinking among students
before and after the game's 8
p.m. kickoff. In anticipation of
any problems related to student
drinking, the University has mul-
tiple safety measures planned.
At a press conference at the
University's Junge Family Cham-
pions Center on Tuesday, Athletic
Director Dave Brandon, Univer-
sity Department of Public Safety
Executive Director Greg O'Dell
and the University's Vice Presi-
dent of Student Affairs E. Royster
Harper discussed their concerns
about alcohol intake before, dur-
ing and after the game.
"Our primary responsibility is
that students will have a safe and
fun event," Harper said. "Because
if it is not safe, it really is not fun,

After getting a complete cur-
ricular reconstruction under
Dean Bryan Rogers during the
past 12 years, the School of Art
& Design will soon be under new

leadership when Rogers retires in
June.
Rogers wrote in an e-mail that
his retirement comes at a time
when he's ready to take a break
from constantly working and
eager to explore other aspects of
life outside of the School of Art &
Design.
"While I've always believed
that teaching, 'deaning' and art-
making were part of the same
creative cloth, I am indeed look-
ing forward to, among other

things, having more time to work
in my studio," wrote Rogers, who
is a painter.
But Rogers also said he'll miss .

ticularly the opportunity to help
advance higher education initia-
tives.
"I hope that I have contrib-
uted to unifying the educational
programs of the School of Art

A spirited Shakespearian

What did you do
before coming to the
University?
I grew up in Denver,
Colorado. Then I went
to college at Princeton,
and then I spent a year in
France studying Renais-
sance literature. ThenI
went to Marvard where
Idid my masters and my
Ph.D.
What brought you to
Michigan?
Icame to teach in
the English department
because of the strength of
the department. There's a
great Renaissance faculty
here, there's a wonderful
creative writing program

- the kinds of interests
that are hoth academic
and creative - and I felt
like this would be a great
place for me. It was a very
easy decision.
What inspired you to
become an English pro-
fessor?
I felt like I was good at
reading books, and I felt I
was pretty good at writ-
ing, and I didn't know if
I was good at anything
else other than those two
things.
What courses do you
currently teach?
I'm teaching acourse on
Shakespeare's early plays,
which is a lecture course,

and I'm teaching an intro-
duction to poetry course
which is a small, 200-level
What's your favorite
Shakespeare play and
why?
I don't have one, but
I'm very fond of "Twelfth
Night." I love the brother-
sister relationship in that
play, and I also like how.
alienating the type of
humor is. It's sort of acom-
bination about what I love
about Shakespeare, that
he writes certain things
that we immediately iden-
tify with - in this case,
the strong bond between a
brother and a sister - and

then he does other things
that are very estranging.
What do you think
sets you apart from
other professors in the
department?
I think, that we're all
different from each other
by virtue of our person-
alities. We're a collection
of a very diverse group of
thinkers. I'm probably less
mature than a lot of my
colleagues. Probably what
drives me to Shakespeare
is the kind of silliness of
some of the plays and the
bawdy humor, which I
always enjoy.

NEWS BRIEFS
DETROIT
Three former Red
Wings die in plane
crash in Russia
Former Detroit Red Wings
assistant coach Brad McCrimmon,
player Ruslan Salei and prospect
Stefan Liv were among 43 people
killed when a Russian jet carry-
ing the Lokomotiv Yaroslavl team
in Russia's Kontinental Hockey
League crashed yesterday near
the western city ofYaroslavl.
McCrimmon, 52, was a Detroit
assistant coach for the past three
seasons. He was a defenseman
who played 18 seasons (1979-1997)
in the NHL, including three with
Detroit (1990-93). McCrimmon
also played with the Boston Bru-
ins, Philadelphia Flyers, Calgary
Flames, Hartford Whalers and
Phoenix Coyotes.
"I've known him a long time.
He was my defense partner when
I was a rookie (1991-92)," Red
Wings captain Nicklas Lidstrom
said about McCrimmon, who was
hired in May as Lokomotiv's head
coach. "The defensemen learned
a lot from him.. We all wished
him well when we heard he was
leaving."
NEW YORK
Lawmakers want
cancer added to
Sept.11 disease list
A new medical study supports
the argument for including can-
cers on a list of World Trade Cen-
ter-linked diseases that qualify
for assistance under the national
Sept. 11 health program, federal
lawmakers said yesterday.
"The evidence is now com-
pelling," said U.S. Rep. Jerrold
Nadler, standing with colleagues
at the entrance to the subway
station at the trade center site in
lower Manhattan. "It's essential
that we do this."
But evidence of a cancer tie
is still largely lacking. The law-
makers - Nadler was joined
by U.S. Reps. Carolyn Malo-
ney, Charles Rangel and Nydia
Velazquez - were responding to
a study conducted by the city's
fire department that found no sig-
nificant increase in cancer rates
among nearly 9,000 firefighters
exposed to trade center dust.
BASTROP, Texas
Firefighters take
control of blaze
Firefighters gained ground
yesterday against one of the most
destructive wildfires in Texas
history even as the state said the
number of homes lost reached
almost 800, and an elite search
team set out to find any victims in
the smoking ruins.
Gov. Rick Perry, meanwhile,
resumed his presidential cam-

paign after rushing home over the
weekend to deal with the crisis,
traveling to California to meet
his Republican rivals in his first
nationally televised debate.
The blaze has left at least two
people dead, blackened about 45
square miles around Bastrop and
cast a haze over Austin, 25 miles
to the west, where the air smelled
strongly of pine and cedar.
MANAMA, Bahrain
Over 100 prisoners

More than 100 jailed Bahraini
activists - including doctors who
treated injured protesters during
months of anti-government pro-
tests and crackdowns in the Gulf
kingdom - are on hunger strike,
an ;nternational panel said yes-

Inc dry said in a statement that
84 opposition supporters are on

its mechanisms and whether or
not it will be safe to develop for
human use.
"Before we can use the drug
in people or even animals, we
have to learn more about this
prototype," she explained. "It's
a prototype because we haven't
exactly designed a drug out of
it; it's something that's naturally
found in the human body."
Though Chen and her col-
leagues are still in the early
stages of their research, she said
their data has been promising
so far. The group will continue
studying the prototype this
semester in hopes of publishing
a paper on their findings next
year.
Calling her time in the lab
"exciting," Chen said she is
grateful for the opportunity to
conduct formal research and be
part of an ever-changing area of
study.
"(Research) is not a stagnant
field," Chen said. "There's so
much exchanging, and there's
always something new out there
to keep up on."
TRANSFORMING THE
TELECOMMUNICATIONS
LANDSCAPE
In Rackham student Carl
Pfeiffer's engineering research
lab at the University, antennas
the size of quarters are being
mass-produced through a new
process that has the potential to
revolutionize the telecommuni-
cations industry.
Working under Stephen For-
rest, the University's vice presi-
dent for research and a professor
of engineering, and Anthony
Grbic, an associate professor
of engineering at the Univer-
sity, Pfeiffer spent his summer
developing an efficient method
to duplicate tiny antennae for
cell phones and other wireless
devices.
According to Pfeiffer, the
antenna's performance capabili-
ties are comparable to those of
larger ones, but the miniature
antennas can now be produced
more quickly and at a cheaper
cost. Antennae of this size have
been difficult to fabricate in the
past due to a process that was
painstaking and expensive.
"We wanted to develop a pro-
cess that would be attractive for
people in industry to use," Pfei-
ffer said.
The group's innovative pro-
cess of duplicating the anten-
nae involves techniques that are
similar to how computer pro-
cessers are produced, he added.
Once an antenna's desired shape
is determined, the engineers
stamp design patterns on the
base material through a proce-
dure called imprint processing.
Pfeiffer added that the use
of smaller antennas, which are
typically the largest component
in a wireless device, could allow
for a number of new applications
in wireless and cellular technol-
ogy.
"We now want to make things
that people haven't even consid-
ered before, since they haven't
had the ability to print these pat-
terns," he said.

sanitation. More than a decade
later, not much has changed, he
said.
Seeking to make possible the
seemingly impossible, Mwenesi
is one of a group of University
students that worked in Kenya
this summer to improve schools
for students.
E-MAGINE - the group
Mwenesi leads - plans and
implements solar-powered, sus-
tainable communications sys-
tems for rural and off-the-grid
communities. The systems allow
Kenyan teachers and students
to use the Internet and other
technologies to facilitate abetter
classroom experience.
"The teachers are familiar
with technology, but they are in
places where they have no access
whatsoever," Mwenesi said. "I
thought it was a no-brainer to
try totsupport these schools and
teachersbyprovidingthemwith
a means to access the Internet,
and ultimately, more education-
al resources."
To evaluate the need for
the communications systems,
Mwenesi spent his time in Kenya
researching sustainable devel-
opment techniques and seeking
funding from non-governmental
organizations. Having gained
support from a number of NGOs,
Mwenesi said E-MAGINE will
have the resources needed to
develop three to five communi-
cations systems during the next
two semesters. Once the systems
are functioning, the classroom
possibilities are endless, he said.
"I want to help kids have
the chance to realize their own
potential," Mwenesi said.
RESHAPING LIBERIAN
COMMUNITIES

GRANTA
From Page 1A
national tragedy and how lit-
erature has shifted in a post-9/11
world.
"We have an international
and writerly community here,
so it makes sense that this would
happen in Ann Arbor," event
moderator Jeremiah Chamber-
lin said in an interview prior
to the panel. Chamberlin is the
associate director of the English
Department Writing Program,
editor in chief of Fiction Writ-
ers Review and a former Granta
contributor.
"(The University) has a very
strong writing program, only
second in the country to Iowa,
and we have many local writ-
ers," he said. "I'm proud of the
fact that an international jour-
nal would come to us and say
that they think our community
is a great place to begin this dis-
cussion."
Last night, a rain-soaked
crowd of roughly 50 people
found coffee, conversation
and refuge in Nicola's Books.
Perched upon mismatched
chairs, couches and benches
that were fit snugly amongst
shelves and tables filled with
stacks of books, the audience of
students, writers and readers
eagerly awaited the event.
The evening began with read-
ings by Chamberlin and the
three other University writers
who comprised the panel. Fol-
lowing the readings, partici-
pants had a discussion about the
impact of Sept. 11 on the writing
community on a national and
international level.
"'Ten Years Later' takes a
really interesting approach to
this topic," Chamberlin told
the Daily. "Some of the stories
are very clearly related to 9/11.
There's a story called 'Deploy-
ment' about a U.S. Marine who

comes home from Iraq and has
to rehabilitate to living in the
United States, where he's not in
danger all the time."
Chamberlin noted other piec-
es written about Guantanamo
Bay, which also are connected
to 9/11.
"But then there's another
piece that is set in Paris and isn't
related directly to 9/11 except
that something related to mor-
tality is in play," he said.
Regardless of how each piece
relates to 9/11, themes that tie
the stories, essays and poems
together in "Ten Years Later"
include belonging, living in a
changed landscape and mortal-
ity.
According to Chamberlin,
"Ten Years Later" takes an
international snapshot of how
the world looks today, post-9/11,
from perspectives of those who
were directly affected, as well as
those who weren't.
"One of the things I most
admire about this particular
issue of Granta is that 'Ten Years
Later' reminds us that this expe-
rience is not ours alone and that
the ripple effect of it has trav-
eled around the entire globe,"
Chamberlin said.
Granta's issue also serves as
an example of how people use
writing to process what goes on
around them, especially when
caught in a crisis or tragedy like
the attacks on Sept 11.
"I think 9/11 was such a
national trauma in the United
States that many people turned
both to writing and reading
accounts of it," said Linda Gre-
gerson, a poet, professor of Eng-
lish and previous contributor
to Granta. "Writing is a crucial
way for human beings to process
what is otherwise impossible
to take in, in scope and conse-
quence."
According to Gregerson, writ-
ing as an art form is not only a

way to process experiences but
also is a way to experience trag-
edy in the lives of others.
"There's a lot of strength in
writing," Gregerson said. "It's
one of the ways we try to locate
our emotions. There's nothing
like language for its precision It
helps us to come to further clar-
ity about our experiences."
Megan Levad, assistant direc-
tor of the creative writing pro-
gram at the University, also
noted the key role writing took
on in post-9/11 culture.
"Writing has the ability to
articulate the way a person's
internal thought processes
work," Levad said. "It replicates
really personal experiences, and
because it does that, there's a
way in which writing can draw
upon the reader's empathy even
if the reader has never expe-
rienced what they're reading
about."
In today's world, grow-
ing up around TVs and com-
puter screens is accepted and
embraced, but when talking
about immensely traumatic
events like Sept. 11, Chamberlin
noted, written stories, memoirs
and essays still remain the most
powerful medium for sharing
experiences.
"We look at paintings, and
we watch films, but when you
read, you're literally inside a
character. That's what's unique
(about stories)," Chamberlin
-said. "When we're reading about
these challenging situations,
we're living a Marine's rede-
ployment, and we feel his fear as
he can't rid himself of the feel-
ing of walking through Fallujah

Enforcement one awry
Unjust rulings call for clearer drug policy
Though Michigan voters approved medicinal marijuana as
a legal prescription for prescribed individuals nearly three
years ago, patients and caregivers have faced an ongoing
battle in trying to obtain and provide the substance. The issue
became even more severe in late August when Lansing dispensa-
ries - at least 20 of them - were ruled to be a violation of the 2008
ballot initiative and were forced to close their doors.

Patients who use marijuana for symptom
relief were also ruled against last week when an
appeals court determined that they must wait at
least 30 days after registering for a state mari-
juana card before beginning to grow plants.
This means that Lansing residents who have a
prescription for medical marijuana will poten-
tially have to wait a month before beginning the
process of providing their own prescription.
It seems that Michigan law makers and law
enforcement are refusing to accept the legal-
ity of medical marijuana - regardless of voter
approval - and are treating patients as crimi-
nals. And the troubles facing Lansing dispen-
sary owners are far from being outside the
norm. Since the laws passage, dispensaries
and compassion clinics have been raided, and
lawmakers and law enforcement officials have
been interpreting the laws in a way that makes
obtaining the legal prescription as difficult as
possible.
Lansing dispensary owners and their sup-
porters justifiably fought back yesterday at a
rally seeking to raise money to support their
cause. They plan to either appeal the court deci-
sion right away or ask for an emergency staying
of the ruling. Either way, they will fightefortheir
legal right to continue to provide a service that
many Lansing residents urgently need.
While many government officials think of
marijuana strictly in terms of itsgeneral illegal-
ity, medical marijuana is an important drugthat
helps many people who suffer from painful dis-
eases. Many residents throughout the state rely

on it for relief from symptoms like chronic pain
or nausea associated with chemotherapy. Peo-
ple enduring such treatments - some of which
are induced by prescribed, legal medicines -
should be able to usea substance that will help
ease their discomfort.
Ann Arbor City Council members recently
discussed the Michigan Court of Appeals rul-
ing and expressed uncertainty about how to
proceed with the city's new medical marijua-
na dispensary licensing board.
Without an immediate change in Lan-
sing, these people will either be forced to go
without the medicinal marijuana they need,
or obtain it through illegal means. If the dis-
pensaries are not operating in the proper way,
then that needs to be addressed. But forcing
all of them to close their doors addresses the
issue at the expense of patients. The court
system needs to realize the suffering that this
shut down can cause and grant the stay until
the dispensary owners are able to take legal
action on their own behalf.
There is no doubt that the current law
pertaining to medical marijuana is unclear.
However, that doesn't mean that state offi-
cials have the right to enforce it as they see fit.
Michigan lawmakers need to come together
and create a unified, statewide solution to the
conflicts over medical marijuana. They need
to form policy that is clear and comprehensive
to make it simple for caregivers and patients to
provide and obtain medical marijuana within
the bounds of the law.

f you are a liberal and you
debate politics with your coun-
terparts from the political right,
you have prob-
ably taken a beat-
ing these past
few months. You
have heard all,
the anti-Obama
talking points
already as your
conservative
friends try to DAR-WEI
convinceyouthat CHEN
the president and
his party are
undermining the country with liber-
alism.
They might cite President Barack
Obama's latest disapproval rating of
55 percent, according to the Sept. 5
Rasmussen Reports (even though a
significant number of those people
disapprove probably because they
think Obama is not liberal enough).
Another item they could bring up
is Obama's re-election prospects
against a generic Republican presi-
dential candidate, which show the
president down 39 to 47 percent,
according to a Gallup poll conduct-
ed this summer (of course, "generic
Republican presidential candidate"
does not have Texas Gov. Rick Per-
ry's anti-evolution problem or former
Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney's
"corporations are people" problem).
They might even try to indict the
whole Democratic Party by pointing
out the disapproval ratings of Con-
gressional Democrats, which sat at
68 percent in mid-August according
to the Associated Press (Republican
Congressmen polled even worse,
however, at 75 percent disapproval).
Perhaps the most damning statis-
tic, the old "right direction or wrong
track" question as posed by Reuters,
shows that a whopping 73 percent of
Americans think the country is on the
wrong track. The overarching point,

your conservative friends may say, is
that Obama and the Democrats are
making things worse in this country
by pursuing extreme left-wing policy.
Therefore, the Dems will eventually
get hammered for it because the pub-
lic agrees with Republicans.
But let's dive deeper into the
"wrong track" statistic because a)
conservative pundits and politicians
love to use it to attack the president's
liberal views and b) I poked holes in
the other talking points already. The
implication of the statistic is that if
the country ison the wrong track, the
president (and by extension, liberal
policy) must be at fault because he
is the highest-ranking official in the
land - or as former President George
W. Bush puts it, the "decider." Of
course, that inference makes sense
- if you try not to think too much.
The leap that conservatives like to
make is from "the country is on the
wrong track, and Obama is leading
the country" to "conservative policy
is therefore the right way to go, and
Obama's agenda is not popular." And
what a leap it is.
Presumably, when the "right
direction or wrong track" question
is asked by pollsters, people have in
mind a"right direction" for thecoun-
try. Therefore, figuring out what
that direction is would be informa-
tive when trying to determine who
to blame for America being on the
wrong track. Let's use the economy
as an example because it seems to
be the most important issue heading
into the 2012 elections.
What do Americans think is a
good way forward for the economy?
According to a CNN poll in August,
63 percent of Americans want high-
er-income earners and corporations
to pay higher taxes, a decidedly lib-
eral view preached by Obama that
pours cold water on Republicans
trying to create an economically
populist message. Currently, taxes

on the wealthy and businesses are at
the lowest levels in decades, and big
business profits are at historic highs
(a conservative utopia, right?). How
about solving the nation's long-term I
debt problem? An average of 23 polls
over the past eight months show
that 65 percent of Americans want
a balanced approach consisting of
spending cuts and revenue increases.
Again, this approach is something
that Obama has advocated for repeat-
edly, while the GOP has stubbornly
insisted on reducingthe deficitsolely
through spending cuts. By the way,
the GOP plan is whatthe countrygot
in the recent debt deal.
What do citizens
think is the best
way forward? I
After taking a look at these poll
numbers, what Americans want is
clear: liberal economic policy. Even
if we don't talk about what econo-
mists say - the stimulus should
have been larger, for example -
the Republicans cannot claim that
the public is on their side. Perhaps
Obama has been ineffective in leg-
islating his ideas in the face of his-
torically intransigent opposition,
leading to disappointment in the
country's direction. However, con-
flating that disappointment with
the notion that people are turning
away from liberal policies would be
a mistake. People are still buying
Obama's hope and change. When
people say the country is on the
wrong track, many believe Republi-
cans are the drivers.

Law school's broken system

I

Itspartially about us

In the last year, The Michigan Daily pub-
lished two columns about the economics of law
school, one on its opinion page and one in its
weekly magazine, The Statement. Both pieces
alert prospective law students to the challenge
caused by the combination of the high cost of
law school tuition and the fierce competitive-
ness of the legal job market. The Daily's cover-
age of this issue is part of a larger trend: After
years of silence on the issue, The New York
Times published three articles on the cost of
law school between January and July of this
year, all in either its Sunday Business or Busi-
ness Day section. Among other things, these
articles comment on the fact that many law
schools are not forthright about their students'
job prospects.
There are about 100 active members of the
University's chapter of the pre-law fraternity
Kappa Alpha Pi, according to LSA senior The-
resa Munaco, the chapter's president. Munaco
said the number typically rises to about 140
students by the winter semester, but then
decreases when students graduate in May. This
group, probably, encompasses just a fraction
of all the students at the Uiversity who are
interested in going to law school. Hopefully,
the journalistic attention paid to the economic
challenges faced by law school students will
provide interested University students more of
the information they deserve and allow them
to take into account the true advantages, disad-
vantages and costs of law school.
While the cost of law school (relative to
the economic opportunities a legal educatidn
is likely to provide) is a worthwhile concern,
prospective students should also be aware of
another, related pathology affecting the law
school system. The educational methods used
by law schools to teach students are broken.
Law schools inadequately evaluate students
and emphasize grades and other competitive
distinctions more than real learning. Intheory,
a legal education is an intellectual experience
that enriches a person's whole life, regardless
of career. But law schools don't provide stu-
dents the full intellectual opportunities they
deserve.
Law schools as institutions fail to focus on
teaching. This problem manifests itself in very
la'ge class sizes. According to data collected
by the American Bar Association, the typical
first-year class at the University's Law School
has 93 students. Almost all law school courses
are taught using the Socratic method, in which

a professor teaches by questioning students
instead of lecturing. The Socratic method
works by engaging students, but in classes of
80 to 100 students, sustained participation by
an individual student is impossible.
It might seem logical to think that the style
of student evaluation used in undergraduate
courses - multiple written assignments or
exams in every course - would be used again
in law school. While this system would work
well in law school, it is not used. Most law
school courses are graded on the basis of single,
comprehensive final examinations.
A deficiency in this method of evaluation
is that students are given no feedback while a
course is ongoing. For most lawschool courses,
faculty members only look at students' work
when grading their exams after the course is
over. In consequence, students waste their
time by using study methods that don't work,
or by misunderstanding concepts without real-
izing it. The lack of evaluation is especially
harmful because beginning law students, who
are learning to do legal analysis for the first
time, badly need feedback in order to learn and
improve.
Finally, the competitive legal job market has
intensified both students' and employers' focus
on grades. Students also compete for other
credentials like law review membership. This
focus on competitive distinctions has perverse
effects. A student might sign up for a course
she's not interested in because the prospects of
a good grade are higher than for other courses,
or a student might pursue law review member-
ship for credentialing purposes even though
he doesn't have a natural interest in editorial
work and would learn more by concentrating
on coursework.
The teaching and learning that goes on in
law school is hobbled by large course sizes,
the practice of providing students no feedback
other than final exam grades and a focus on
competitive distinctions. In particular, large
class sizes and the lack of evaluation serve no
educational purpose, harm students and usu-
ally go unquestioned by law school adminis-
trators, faculty and even students. The only
advantage of these practices is their low cost.
Law school could be done better, and should
be, for the sake of current and prospective
students.
Ben Brown is a third-year student at the
University of Michigan School of Law.

arlier this summer, New
'York Times columnist David
Brooks sent an unfamiliar
message to col-

lege graduates:
"It's not about
you." This is in
great contrast
with commence-
ment speakers
who often urge
students to never
settle, display
individuality and
"march to the
beat of your own
drum."

ERIK
TORENBERG

As graduation looms for the class
of 2012, my graduation class, I've
been thinking: Brooks's message is
only partially true.
In a past column titled "The Sum-
moned Self," Brooks wrote about a
successful businessman who, during
his college years, spent an hour every
night contemplating his future plans
and solidifying his life purpose. This
approach is rare, Brooks notes: "Most
successful young people don't look
inside and then plan a life. They look
outside and find a problem, which
summons their life."
Yet, Brooks claims college students
are still being told to focus inward -
to figure out what they want and then
to live their life - exactly at a time
when they need to start thinking
about things bigger than themselves.
"The successfulyoung adult is begin-
ning to make sacred commitments
- to a spouse, a community and call-
ing - yet mostly hears about freedom
and autonomy," he wrote.
However, such commitments are a
lot to ask for. How can we choose a
definite career path when we've only
held two part-time jobs? And where
to live, if we've onlylived at home and
at college? Or to even contemplate
marriage, when we've had one major
relationship, and our parents have
been divorced twice?
Universities don't require students

to choose their majors immediately,
since they obviously haven't taken
enough courses yet to know what
they like and what they don't. How
can we be expected to make deci-
sions that will affect the rest of our
lives when we haven't had enough
experience to know what we want
and what we don't?
We can't. It's more likely that
Brooks is suggesting that we start
to think about these important deci-
sions, not that we rush them. It's
more likely he believes the terms
"finding yourself" and "gaining
experience" should refer to experi-
menting and tinkering with relation-
ships, jobs and lifestyle niches with
the intent to learn what's out there
and what we want, instead of merely
checking items off our eyer-growing
bucket lists.
I don't want my commencement
speaker to tell me that it's all about
me. or that it has nothing to do with
me.
I'd prefer she speaks about not
only how we can help others, but
also, how we can help ourselves. I'd
prefer she acknowledges that it's at
least partially about us.
She would recognize Brooks's
main point: We should construct our
identity through interacting with the
real world, realizing and acting upon
where we can make the most positive
impact and not stay isolated in our
rooms, or in the desert of a foreign
country.
She would call the businessman's
actions mentioned in the beginning
of this column potentially imprudent
because the time he spent planning
his life in advance may have cost him
other opportunities he couldn't have
planned for that could have altered
his life plans for the better.
She would add: Think about most
of the important decisions you've
ever made. Most likely, they weren't
planned years in advance. It's more
likely they came about through a
combination of diligent preparation

and taking advantage of unexpected
opportunities.
On the other hand, she'd also
emphasize how imprudent it would
be to avoid internal reflection. She'd
criticize the person who reacts to
his every whim, never examines if
he feels fulfilled by his activities and
never corrects patterns in his mis-
takes.
She'd say it's best to do both. Look
inside: Think about what you want,
what you can do and plan according-
ly. But also know that life will prob-
ably force those plans to change. Be
open to opportunities, to experienc-
ing things you didn't plan for. Then
go back to the drawing board: reflect,
tinker.
Students should
look at the
big picture.
She'd make the following anal-
ogy: Let things hit you like a bruise.
Embrace a person, an experience,
an ideology, live it, and reflect after-
wards. Did you like the bruise? Nid it
identify with everything you wantto
represent? If it didn't, don't let it hit
you again.
I'd like my commencement speak-
er to close with the following: Today's
commencement speakers often tell
you students to help yourselves, and
Brooks tells us that by helping others,
you'llhelp yourself. I agree with him.
But I also believe that by helping
yourself - through pursuing your
passions, maximizing-your talents
and achieving self-contentment -
you will be helping others too.

DEAN
From Page 1A
the University and the world," he
wrote.
ot anticipation of hiring a
new dean, University Provost
Philip Hanlon has spearheaded
a Search Advisory Committee
to aid the process of finding a
replacement who will continue
to advance the school's curricu-
lum. The committee will seek
input from the surrounding com-
munity, including undergraduate
and graduate students.
The committee to find a new
dean consists of faculty repre-
sentatives from the Art & Design
School, astaffmember appointed
by Hanlon, two students and one
Art & Design alum. Other com-
mittee members include Dean
of the College of Engineering
David Munson, professors from
the Taubman College of Archi-
tecture and Urban Planning and
a School of Music, Theatre &
Dance faculty member.
James Cogswell, Arthur F.
Thurnau professor in the School
of Art & Design, is chair of the
committee. Cogswell wrote in an
e-mail interview that the com-
mittee takes all suggestions and
input seriously.
"We scheduled an open meet-
ing (in the spring) for under-
graduates and another meeting
for graduate students to discuss
the challenges and opportunities
ahead," he wrote.
After receiving community
input, the committee looks for
nominations and applications
for the dean's position in order
to build a diverse candidate pool
before beginning the selection
process. The process will include
confidential interviews with
the candidates and campus vis-
its, which will all be taken into
account before a candidate is rec-
ommended to Hanlon.
Through the extensive search
process, which will garner
input from faculty in a variety
of disciplines, the committee
will attempt to "(break) down
disciplinary boundaries and
walls that are so common in
other schools," according to the

school's online job description.
Cogswell noted that it is
importantthe school maintains
its connections to the College
of Engineering, Ross School
of Business and Architecture
and Urban Planning School
in upcoming years. Qualifica-
tions in the online job descrip-
tion include a candidate with an
entrepreneurial mindset, skills
in fundraising and budgeting,
a commitment to diversity and
strong communication skills.
Cogswelldnoted that the new
dean should maintain progres-
sion in the school's curriculum.
"Our school is recognized for
its innovative curriculum," Cog-
swell wrote. "How we build on
our existing curriculum is up to
the faculty as we go forward. We
are looking for a dean who can
help us with that process."
One part of the school's cur-
riculum that the committee is
seeking input on is the new Inter-
national Experience Require-
ment, which was implemented
last year and requires students
to study abroad. However, the
requirement may not remain in
the school's curriculum under
the new dean, Cogswell wrote.
Art & Design sophomore Tay-
lor Ross wrote in an e-mail that
she thinks it is important for
the study abroad requirement to
remain in place since the Univer-
sity values developing cultured
and globally-informed students.
"One of the core missions of
the School of Art & Design is to
produce well-rounded artists
and designers," she wrote. "Part
of that is having an understand-
ing of people and cultures that
differ from one's own."
Art & Design alum Katha-
rine Drake, who graduated this
past spring, echoed Ross's senti-
ments, adding that her experi-
ence studying abroad in Turkey
allowed her to grow as an indi-
vidual and develop her artwork.
"I think the study abroad
requirement is one of the most
important aspects of the program
at Art & Design because you have
the opportunity to grow asa per-
son in a different place besides
Ann Arbor, which directly affects
your artwork," Drake said.

SAFETY

thing we can do from time to time,
but this Saturday is going to be a
significant test."
As part of a joint effort between
the Athletic Department, the
Office of Student Affairs and DPS
to decrease the amount of drink-
ing among students, non-alcoholic
events are scheduled throughout
the day and more public safety
officers will patrol campus.
According to University Hospi-
tal Emergency Department data
obtained from a June 17,2011 Free-
dom of Information Act request,
the number of individuals ages 18
to 24 who were treated for alco-
hol intoxication from May 1, 2010
to May 1, 2011 was consistently
higher on the dates of home foot-
ball games. Of the top 30 dates, six
of the seven home football games
last year had the highest number
of hospital admittances for alcohol
intoxication. Oct. 9,2010 -the day
of the Michiga vs. Michigan State
game - had the highest number of
hospital admittances at 35 people.
O'Dell said DPS will have an
increased security presence on
Saturday night, and he hopes
to stop intoxicated people from
entering the stadium. He added

that people who are working the
gates have had extensive training
to spot those who have had too
much to drink.
"Our hope for this is basically
that we'll have great fan behavior,
and we'll be bored as cops here,"
O'Dell said. "We really hope that
does happen, but if it doesn't, we
are prepared totake police action."
Mary Jo Desprez, the Uni-
versity's alcohol and other drug
policy and prevention administra-
tor, said the University's plan to
deal with student drinking covers
students with no alcohol issues to
those with severe problems.
"As an institution, you can't
just do one thing for this one
group," Desprez said. "You have
to do something to meet everyone
where they're at."
Besides football games, dates
with high hospital admittances
for alcohol issues corresponded
with holidays such as Halloween
and St. Patrick's Day, according to
the FOIA data. Desprez said those
two holidays as well as football
games have higher numbers of
students drinking heavily because
of expectations instilled by the
media and alcohol industry.
"(There's) this culture that
magnifies the role that alcohol
plays on campus, and what we
would like to do is right-size it,"

Harpertoo, noted that students
have preconceived notions about
drinkingin college.
"(Students) can get the impres-
sion that everybody drinks, and
everybody over-drinks, and that's
really not the case." Harper said.
"Most students, particularly
Michigan students, they drink
reasonably."
Harper and Desprez said stu-
dents' expectations about drink-
ing in college can be corrected by
sending safety messages to stu-
dents. For the night game, Desprez
helped create a public announce-
ment that aired during the West-

ern Michigan game last Saturday,
which included former Michigan
football player Desmond Howard
telling students to "Stay in the
Blue" - the University's slogan to
remind students to drink respon-
sibly, with the "blue" referring to
a blood alcohol concentrationlevel
of .06 or below.
Brandon emphasized that alco-
hol in the stadium will not be tol-
erated on Saturday.
"We're going to put every effort

Two different Troy Woolfolks

In one instance, the fifth-year3
senior cornerback sprung off

delivering a big hit on a wideF
receiver.
In the next, Woolfolk wask

Balanced attack will open up field for Wolverines

Michigan counting
on more than just
Ezurike on offense
this season
By STEVEN BRAID
Daily Sports Writer
Last year, the Michigan wom-
en's soccer team depended on a
freshman - Nkem Ezurike - to
carry the load offensively.
While Ezurike has continued
to be an offensive force so far
this season for the Wolverines
(4-2 overall), it looks like last
year's top goal scorer will have
more company in that category
this year, as her teammates have
displayed' a more aggressive
mindset on the offensive end this
season.
Michigan's new offensive
attitude could potentially limit
Ezurike's scoring opportunities,
as a multitude of players have
shown an ability to rack up goals.
But Michigan coach Greg
Ryan believes the scoring bal-
ance will not only give Ezurike
more opportunities to score, but
will also open up the field for the
rest of the Wolverines.
"It will probably help them
score more goals, because if you
have balanced scoring it's harder
for (opponents) to focus on one

confidence and now a lot of expe-
rience under their belt," Ryan
said. "Ezurike, obviously, is a
good goal scorer. Clare Stachel
has really stepped up as a player
that has that drive to get a goal.
(Sophomore midfielder) Meghan
Toohey, if she keeps on attack-
ing, I think the goals will come
from her.
"I think that, in a sense,
they're taking more responsibil-
ity to be goal scorers (this year).
Players that score goals want
that pressure. I think this year,
you just see more determination
to go forward and score goals
from this group of players."
When Ryan took over four
years ago, the team was a
defense-orientated squad, scor-
ing around one goal per game.
Now, Michigan is averaging
more than two goals per game.
Michigan's offensive depth
couldn't have been exhibited any
better than in its game against
Duquesne roughly two weeks
ago. Six different players ham-
mered home goals and three
players notched assists en route
to a dominating 6-0 win.
The Wolverines's sudden
boost on offense can be tied back
to the emergence of Stachel.
Entering the season with five
career goals, Stachel looks well
on her way towards surpassing
that total this season alone. Sta-

chel has attacked more aggres-
sively this year and already has
a three-game scoring streak,
which culminated in a game-
winning goal off of a penalty kick
against UC-Riverside.
"Partly, it's the maturing of
some very good freshman that
started for us last year and part
of it is Clare Stachel stepping up
and saying, 'Hey, I'm the experi-
"They're
taking more
responsibility to
be goal scorers."
enced player here and I need to
have the drive to push this team
forward and score goals,' " Ryan
said. "She's doing a great job."
Like Ryan, Ezurike under-
stands that a more balanced
attack could open up more scor-
ing chances for her, so she's wel-
comed the help with open arms.
"I feel like we've been mesh-
ing really well," Ezurike said.
"It's just a great positive for the
team to know that so many play-
ers that we put on the field can
score goals."

Ass C
Michigan sophomore Nkem Ezurike wont hase to carry Michigan's offensive load as much as she did last season.

or two players," Ryan said. "Last
year, it was pretty much Nkem
getting most of our goals and a
few other players chipping in.
"I'm really hoping that some
of the attention will be taken
off of Nkem and that she'll actu-
ally have more opportunities to
score. We're trying to do some
things in our attack to put her in
better positions to score."
Through its first six games,

Michigan has scored 13 goals -
the Wolverines' most explosive
start in six years.
Not only have the Wolverines
improved their offense mark-
edly from last year, but they're
also getting contributions from
a profusion of players. Eight dif-
ferent players have tallied goals,
while 10 have recorded at least
one assist.
Among those setting the pace

offensively for the team are
Ezurike and redshirt junior for-
ward and captain Clare Stachel,
who are tied for a team-best
three goals.
Michigan has received a spark
off the bench from sophomore
Shelby Chambers-Garcia, who
has netted two goals coming off
the bench.

In a rough economy, independ
quirk still reigns supreme amo
Ann Arbor's recent ventures
 Vby dTao,OD Edito

ng o matter where you were this
summer, it's been virtually
impossible to ignore the many
signs of a floundering econo-
my. There's political gridlock
in Washington and panic on
Wall Streeptconomists date the likelihood
of a double-dip recession while a pervasive
sense of malcontent permeates a Main Street
plagued by 9.1-percent unemployment. And as
students return for the upcoming school year,
they'll be returning to a city that's lost some of
its corporate symbols butgained new marks of
--- its independent spirit at the same time.
Over the summer, @burger, an experimen-
tal venture from Big Boy Restaurants, closed
its location in the McKinley Towne Center
building for the final time after just 11 months
in the area. But what more studentswill notice
are the signs advertising the sales at Borders.
Still, despite the tenuous economic environ-
ment, entrepreneurs continue to set up shop
in Ann Arbor, drawn by the city's smaller, col-
lege-town feel, sophisticated reputation and
their previous ties to the region.
Located just a few blocks from what was
formerly @burger is Avtomobile (pronounced
"automobile"), a new vintage clothing shop
that opened its doors in July. According to
owners Maris Turner and Sara Renner, who
met at Columbus College of Art and Design,
the shop was founded after a stint in New
York City that left them both disillusioned
and looking to move closer to home.
"We wanted to be away from the corporate
thing," said Renner, an Ohio native. "Coming
to Michigan was closer to my home and fam-
ilythan New York was."
Despite its location on Liberty St. - an
inconspicuous, blink-and-you-miss-it hole-
in-the-wall - the storeowners are highly
enthusiastic. Business has been good, and
with the return of the student body it's only
improving.
"We opened at (the Ann Arbor Art Fair)
which was just awesome for us. A lot of people
came in and found out what we are," Turner
said. "Last week, when the students were
coming in, there was alot of traffic and people

seemed really excited."
Thanks in large part to the city's compara-
tively lower costs, the duo hasn't really been
affected by the slumping economy and holds
a certain come-what-may attitude towards
potential recem~n.
"(An sn't New York, so the rent's'
definitely a big perk," Turner said. "It's a risky
time, but you might as well embrace it."
A few blocks from Avtomobile, another
new business has also sprung up. Italian
eatery Mani Osteria, the brainchild of Ann
Arbor-native Adam Baru, opened last May.
Baru, who moved back to Ann Arbor from
Philadelphia, returned to raise a family and
start his first restaurant project. He brings
with him years of experience operating res-
taurants for Iron Chefs, such as Masaharu
Morimoto and Jose Garces.
"I'm probably one of the few people who
have worked and survived two Iron Chefs,"
Baru joked.
Despite the number of existing Italian res-
taurants in Ann Arbor, Baru sees plenty of
room for his venture, which serves cuisine
using locally sourced ingredients made fresh
in-house. Though he recognizes the challeng-
es business owners face in a bad economy, he
remains optimistic about business and con-
tinues to emphasize quality.
"I think that we're offering really great
ingredients for a really quality product," he
said. "We're just trying to hopefully add to and
enhance what is already a great diningscene."
Existing businesses are also choosing to
expand, albeit in unique, cost-effective ways.
Mark's Carts, an outdoor collection of food
carts, opened its doors in May and has already
introduced two new carts to its courtyard
on West Washington. Owner Mark Hodesh
attributes their success to the recession-proof
nature of food carts and the fun culture that
surrounds them.
"Carts are sort of anti-business cycle,"
Hodesh said. "It's fun to eat and people have
a goodtime."
The newest cart in the courtyard is actually
a franchise of an existing business.

FOODSWARS
Each week, one Ann Arbor staple menu item becomes a
battlefield as Daily Arts editors butt heads over which restaurant
makes it best. Where should you go for your burger, fro-yo or
garden omelette? Daily Arts will fight for the truth.

TIOS
401 East Liberty
The chicken nachos at Tios are a study
in mediocrity. The chicken is too salty,
but acceptable. The cheese appears to be
clumped around four or five chips in total,
but at least it's tasty cheese. The guaca-
mole and sour cream are fine and served
amply, but they're presented in scoops,
which is inconvenient and does nothing to
remedy the general "fill 'er up" reputation
of Tex Mex joints. All in all, "eh."

Fancy nachos. Pretentious nachos.
Nachos with pickled red onion and artisan
cheese and organic chips. If you are drink-
ing beer that actually tastes like beer and
want to add a dash of class to your night,
Red Chicken Nachos will elevate your
game. Unfortunately, they are plagued
with the classic ingredient dog pile and the
tomatillo salsa comes with a sour taste not
on the menu.

BUFFALO WILD WINGS
205 South State
In truth, the only thing that was ulti-
mate about B-Dubs's Ultimate Nachos
was the size of the dish. Piles of tortilla
chips that were slightly soggy covered
with nacho cheese, beef and salsa made
for an average experience that would only
be enjoyable if they were incredibly cheap
(which they weren't, by the way). The
over-spiciness didn't help, either. BWW
should stick to the wings.
BTB CANTINA
1140 South University
BTB has an "everything but the kitchen
sink" approach to nachos, loading their
translucent chips with mounds of black
beans, a watery substance that resembles
salsa and cold cheese. If you've consumed
enough cheap vodka when stumbling into
BTB, this monstrosity might be edible. But
during the unforgiving light of day, the
mountains of food in your stomach will
leave you yearning for Taco Bell.

Humanities or the sciences: Which is
the more productive to human race?
You've had this debate over and over
again with your hallmates, like some
never-ending Luke Skywalker/Darth
Vader death match. Yet, this struggle
may be fickle. The Honors seminar
"Creativity in the Sciences and the Arts"
will uncover the confluence of the two
disciplines, exploring how science and
art are truly invested with each other
- possibly even have Luke and Darth
Vader band together to fight the Emper-
or Palpatine of the Business School.

enemy is to know your enemy. Learn the
art of throwing buckets of water at your

this first-year seminar really needs to be
opened up to all students. Are we sup-

Rewriting the World with Google

Because it wasn't enough to give the
public a street view of your home, the
latest version of Google Maps will allow
users to rewrite the world in their own
vision, and this course will teach you
the ins and outs of this new feature.
Want to transplant the Jersey Shore far,
far away from human civilization? Take
this course and the world is yours.

Need to fill a hole in your schedule?
Consider this art history course on
Greek vase painting. It's like basket
weaving, except instead of weaving the
actual baskets, you get to look at pic-
tures of really, really, really old baskets.
You also get to analyze them stylistical-
ly and talk about where they were made
and who made them! Required texts are
to be determined, but we'd assume that
there'll be a lot of books full of glossy
pictures.
Disney's Lands: Consuming
Wonders in America;
HISTART 489, Sec. 002
A long time ago, a guy named Walt Dis-
ney had amazing visions of mythical
cartoon worlds for the edification and
enjoyment of everybody (unless you
were Jewish). In 1955, he turned these
dreams into theme parks, which are
also open for the edification and enjoy-
ment of everybody (unless you're poor).
If your parents gave you a deprived
childhood, examine in great detail
what you never got to enjoy: theme park
depictions of the American Frontier,
colonialist Adventure, childhood Fan-
tasy and utopian Tomorrow.
What Does the Movie Say About
the Book?;
ENGLISH 2%8, Sec. 007
The days of "I'll just watch it on Netf-
lix" in place of actually doing the read-
ing ended when you took that first step
out of high school. But if you're the type
of person who rushes to the bookstore
for the latest bestseller and goes gaga
for cinematic premieres, this class is
the one for you. Bonus: You get to watch
"Clueless." Nothing says "project" like
Jane Austen and your run-of-the-mill
quasi-incest relationship.

And the lesser evil is: Jolly Pumpkin

or the rise of teenage smoking,
or the phenomena of word of
mouth, or any number of the
other mysterious changes that
mark everyday life is to think
of them as epidemics. Ideas
and products and messages
and behaviors spread just like
viruses do."
It's true. Trends inhabit
places like a good-looking
plague - an excited, contagious
spread of "let's look, talk, dance,
consume ... like this ... now." It
is a forward motion: always on
the edge, always about to adjust
a moment prior to the change of
season. In college, or at least in
the undergraduate land of Ann
Arbor, these trends tend to be
more exaggerated: more rapid
in rotation, more hipster and
with exception to our everyday-
enhanced technology, never
more than an arm's reach away
from recycling our parents' past.
Take Ray-Ban Wayfarers, for
example. The style was brought
to the forefront because of
"Risky Business" and "Break-
fast at Tiffany's," but it has
recently been reinstated by
stars like the Olsen twins and
Adam Brody. The leaders of the
popular - A-list movie stars -
establish what is hip. Trend X
proceeds to take its sweet time
to trickle down the food chain.
By the time it gets to the bot-
tom of society, the algae of the
human world, the celebrities
are riding a new trend wave. I
myself am still buying $10 fake-
Bans at the nearest Urban Out-
fitters, playing the continuous
game of catch-up.
The hip-virus seems to work
its way from the famous to the
working class, from the youth to
the wrinkled, and even from the
coasts to the middle of the U.S.
When arriving from southern
California as a freshman to the
University of Michigan, trying
not to clutch too tightly to any
expectations, I was confronted
with a comment from one of my
Michigander, Welcome Week
acquaintances - "Ann Arbor is
the San Francisco of the Mid-
west." It felt more like a nervous
apology than anything else.
I enjoy believing this state-
ment to be a maxim - a law of
trend.
My unavoidably biased opin-
ion that "everything starts on
the West Coast" somewhat
crumbles when I think of my
four-year temporary home here
in Ann Arbor. Yes, it's true -

NEW STORES
From Page 1B
Hut-K Chaats, an Indian restau-
rant serving traditional Indian
street food with a healthy, all-
natural twist, is run by Sumi
Bhojani and her husband, Dr.
Mahaveer Swaroop Bhojani, a
University cancer researcher.
The duo added their cart to the
courtyard in late July. Because
the restaurant's original loca-
tion on Packard St. is several
miles from campus, the pair
wanted a location closer to
downtown at a more affordable
price.
"We wanted something closer
to the town and a bigger place
would have been expensive,"
Sumi Bhojani said.
Business ebbs and flows with
the student population, taut since

in the Golden State, but does
that really say anything about
trendiness?
Probably not.
Somehow, the hip ideas and
trends - most likely coming
from the opposing coasts of our
country and occasionally from
Europe - travel rapid-fire to
the city of Ann Arbor. And we
Ann Arborites sure show our
pride in that.
It seems the "hipster" (flash
image of Natalie Portman in
"Garden State" and Johnny
Depp in anything) has become
mainstream in Ann Arbor, mak-
ing it so that if one is hipster in
its truest form, he or she must
be double hipster - hipsters,
for one, must not regard them-
selves as hipster, and secondly,
they must display trendiness in
a manner of exterior effortless-
ness.
I believe that any queen
or king of "hip," whether it
is Regina George or Michael
Jackson, would recommend to
each and every one of us to con-
stantly reinvent ourselves and
influence the trending culture.
And if by "dress" we mean live,
I endorse Tracy Jordan's advice
to Kenneth in season one of "30
Rock": "Dress every day like
you're going to get murdered in
those clothes."
Trendiness:
It's not just for
California.
Let's not forget that trends
surpass the threads and bling
that cover our bodies and are
defined within the broader
context of social media. Take
the evolution from MySpace to
Facebook to Google+, the odd
"I'll follow you if you follow me"
Tumblr exchange, and hashtags
altering communication of the
English language. What's trend-
ing: Are we leading it or is it
leading us?
I think it's a conversation
that never sleeps. The annoy-
ing kind where no one hangs
up because that would mean
someone would have to say "I
love you" last. What we like to
research in our private time,
model on the streets and con-
verse about with our closest
friends is constantly changing,
and that's why Earth is such
a fascinating place to be. Hip
defines us and we define it; no
one is an innocent bystander
because even if you're out of the
loop, you are defining trend X
by living outside of it. By being
anti-cool, you are making the
beautiful beast stronger.
Indeed, the innate ephemeral
quality of a trend is what makes
it. If you linger too long or live
too long inside of a certain
trend, the hip world will move
onto new stages, leaving you
alone with your Dell computer
and scrunchie (which, accord-
ing to Carrie Bradshaw, has
never been in style to wear out-

the cart opened, their store has
seen business improve, as cus-
tomers have been able to discover
the restaurant's unique offerings.
"The town is very cosmopoli-
tan. People in Ann Arbor are
quite open and willing to try new
stuff," Sumi Bhojani said. "(The
cart's) a good way to send them
over to the restaurant."
The fearless attitude of these
business owners testifies to Ann
Arbor's rich entrepreneurial
landscape, dotted with more
locally owned businesses than
most areas have big-box stores.
It is perhaps this willingness to
open up and explore an environ-
ment plagued by recession that
makes the area so vibrant. As
long as this spirit exists within
the community, entrepreneurs
will keep finding new and better
ways to introduce themselves to
the city's residents.

By JOE CADAGIN
Daily Fine Arts Editor
What's the raunchiest, most
obscene thing you've ever read?
Maybe you've secretly perused
one of those pornographic dime
novels that bookstores try to
pass off as "romance." Maybe
you've peeked at those dirty sto-
ries in the back of women's beau-
ty/gossip magazines. Or maybe
you've even read William Bur-
roughs's "Naked Lunch."
To even attempt a descrip-
tion of Burroughs's novel is a
daunting task - "unconven-
tional" would be an understate-
ment. Lacking any plot, "Naked
Lunch" is a series of loosely con-
nected, stream-of-consciousness
vignettes. Graphic descriptions
of depraved sexual acts - both
heterosexual and homosexual
- are juxtaposed with nauseat-
ing accounts of activities usually
confined to the bathroom. The
result is the literary equivalent
of turning over a rock to see
the squirming, sickening world
beneath and being both fascinat-
ed and repulsed by its contents.
First published in 1959, Bur-
roughs's novel, along with Allen
Ginsberg's poem "Howl" and
Jack Kerouac's "On the Road," is
one of the most important works
to come out of the American
beatnik movement. The book
was written over a period of nine
years, during which Burroughs
wandered the globe feeding a
serious heroin addiction. "Junk,"
the slang term he uses to refer to
the drug, is central to the novel
and inspired the work's gro-
tesque and fantastical images
- everything from a necrophilic
death orgy to a talking anus.
Good taste dictates that I
withhold describing some of the
novel's more gruesome and vul-
gar episodes. But the fact that

testament to the significance of
Burroughs and his contempo-
raries.
"Naked Lunch" was published
at a time of dramatic change
in what authors were allowed
to print. Two years earlier, in
1957, Ginsberg's magnum opus
"Howl" was deemed obscene
for its depiction of drug use
and homosexuality. The First
Amendment won out, however,
in a landmark trial - depicted
in the 2010 film "Howl" starring
James Franco - that protected
the poem from censorship.

door for other radical works.

Reminiscing about a beloved bookstore


Former employees and
frequent customers
make final store visits
By PROMA KHOSLA
Daily TV/New Media
It seems dispiriting to think that the
incoming freshman class and future
generations of students at the Univer-
sity will not have Borders bookstore on
their campus. To those of us who have
several years in Ann Arbor under our
belts, there is no question downtown
will feel incomplete without the sprawl-
ing bookstore that was the best place to
study, meet or just comfortably wander
around for hours.
As Borders faces its final days, nostal-
gia pervades the air surrounding 612 E.
Liberty St. It's hard for students, faculty
and Ann Arbor retailers to pass those
enormous telltale clearance signs with-
out thinking about what the bookstore

has meant over the past few decades.
Hal Brannan worked with Borders
for over 20 years, the last 13 of which
were at store No. 1, the downtown Ann
Arbor location.
Among Brannan's early memories
with the company is receiving his first
profit-sharing check from the Borders
brothers. At the time, in the '80s, Tom
and Louis Borders were sharing their
business profits with employees via pay-
check since the company was still small.
The Borders brothers first opened Bor-
ders Book Shop in Ann Arbor in 1971,
but in the following decades it would
become part of Kmart Corporation and
would include Waldenbooks and anoth-
er bookstore chain called Brentano's.
"That was like, 'oh my gosh,' " Bran-
nan said, remembering that first prof-
it-sharing check. "I was part of the
Borders family. That was when I felt I'd
latched onto something incredible."
Brannan fostered a true sense of com-
munity with his coworkers in every-
thing from holiday parties to forming a

union in the early 2000s.
"I always tried to be fair and open
and honest," he explained. "The kind of
people that work for Borders responded
well to that, so I was able to continue
working at Borders until I could see that
it was time to ... say goodbye."
It was that very sense of community
that drew Luis Paez, a Borders employee
of 11 years, to the Ann Arbor store.
"The atmosphere was quite energiz-
ing," Paez said. "I wanted to work at the
base of the corporation, particularly at
store No. 1, (the store) beinga nerve here
in Ann Arbor of social, economic and
intellectual life."
For Andrea Graef, storeowner of This
& That on E. Liberty St., Borders repre-
sented a constant.
"One of the reasons I picked this spot
(for the store) was because Borders was
across the street from me," she said. "I
use Borders as a place to relax, walk
around and look at books."
She added: "They had the authors
come in and you could talk to them
about their books or the events that
they would hold over there, or just sit on
the floor and read a story to your child
or grandchild, you know, go in there
and introduce them to books. I've been
taking my little granddaughter. At six
months old we started her, sitting on
the floor reading a book ... she's almost
four."
On a larger scale, this reflects Graef's
sadness over the state of the book indus-
try.
"I for one am not into the electronic
book," she said. "I like to hold books, I
like to hold newspapers. Maybe it's old
school, but that's the way I want it. I
want to go and buy books or get them
from the library. I think of my grand-
daughter and I think, what's her life
going to be like if everything goes to
electronic?"
Graef believes Borders was unique as
a local company that grew into a nation-
al corporation, but that it will be espe-
cially missed in its Ann Arbor home as a
pivotal feature of daily life.
"It's the biggest anchor we have
downtown here," she said. "Already I
can see the changes in the neighbor-
hood. The business is down ... at night

because a lot of people used to be in
there. I'm open until 10 so I've seen a
drastic decrease already."
Store No.1 also played host to a vari-
ety of celebrities and authors, including
comedian John Hodgman, actor John
Travolta and musicians John Mayer and
James Taylor.
"Borders played ... a vital role in this
area, not just to the Ann Arbor commu-
nity but to the surrounding towns and
cities, I would say to Southeast Michi-
gan," Paez said. "It's a center for gath-
ering and exchanging ideas about the
literature, whether that was journals or
magazines or newspapers or books or
any other kind of media."
Paez is not only a Borders employee,
but a historian now working on a book
about the store and its history. For him,
it was an "engrossing experience" to
work at store No. 1 and get to know peo-
ple and groups within the corporation.
He feels the impact of Borders ulti-
mately lies in these communities and
the lives it has touched across genera-
tions.
"It's a huge hole in people's lives,
I think it will be," Graef said. "I think

people don't realize it yet because the
door hasn't quite closed, butI think they
will.
"It was a place where you could go
and lose yourself. Even before the cafe
was there and you sat down and had a
cup of coffee or something ... you could
just go in there and shut out the rest of
the world and lose yourself in a wonder-
ful place."
Brannan also enjoyed the distinct
world within the store.
"I remember a lot of good discussion
with customers about current books
and current events, and how rapidlythe 6
book world was able to produce books
on what was going on," Brannan said.
As uncertain as things look in the
world of book retail, Brennan knows the
impact of Borders is unquestionable.
"Borders has put an awful lot of books
into people's homes," he said. "That'll be
a lasting legacy; our books in people's
houses that will get handed down to
generations or taken to used book deal-
ers and read again by somebody else.
People are going tobe finding their Bor-
ders bookmarks and receipts and books
long into the future."

The first Borders store, on Liberty St., was an Ann Arbor landmark since 1971.
