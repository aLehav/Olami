Klobuchar makes 
stop in Ann Arbor

Amy Klobuchar 
discusses domestic 
violcence act
during A2 panel

U.S. Representative Debbie 
Dingell, D-Mich., and Senator 
Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., held 
a press conference focusing on 
protecting victims of domestic 
violence and stalking from gun 
violence 
at 
the 
Washtenaw 
County SafeHouse Center in Ann 
Arbor Saturday morning.
The 
discussion 
centered 
around the reauthorization of 
the Violence Against Women 
Act, which Congress passed 
last month. VAWA, originally 
passed in 1994, was previously 
reauthorized in 2000, 2005 and 
2013. The reauthorization must 
now pass in the Senate.
In 
the 
current 
version 
of 
VAWA, 
only 
individuals 

convicted of abusing a spouse — 
not a partner — are prohibited 
from buying or owning a gun.
The reauthorized bill includes 
a provision to terminate this 
issue, commonly referred to as 
the “boyfriend loophole,” by also 
preventing those who have been 
convicted of abusing a “non-
marital” from buying or owning 
a gun. Additionally, the bill 
would prevent those convicted of 
stalking from possessing a gun.
In her introductory remarks, 
Dingell 
said 
partnerships 
between 
local 
and 
national 
government as well as law 
enforcement are vital to continue 
the discussion on sexual assault.
“It’s an important time to 
have a discussion on this issue,” 
Dingell said. “We can’t do this 
without resources, and we all 
know how important it is.”
Klobuchar said including gun 
violence in VAWA emphasizes 
the seriousness of the issue.

Cecile Richards 
rallies with local 
leaders Tuesday

Tuesday evening, the University 
of Michigan Diag was packed with 
hundreds of people protesting the 
slew of restrictive state abortion 
laws 
being 
passed 
since 
the 
beginning of 2019 and particularly 
over the past few weeks. The rally, 
organized primarily by Planned 
Parenthood Advocates of Michigan, 
was one of over 200 #StopTheBans 
rallies held across the country 
Tuesday.
The 
Ann 
Arbor 
rally 
was 
projected to be one of, if not the, 
largest rally held in Michigan. In an 
email to The Daily, Angela Vasquez-
Giroux, director of communications 
for Planned Parenthood Advocates 
of 
Michigan, 
said 
Planned 
Parenthood appreciates the support 
they receive from Ann Arbor and 
the University’s student body.
“The Ann Arbor community has 
always been welcoming of Planned 
Parenthood and, more importantly, 
our 
core 
value 
of 
providing 
compassionate, 
judgement-free 
care to anyone who needs it,” 
Vasquez-Giroux wrote. “We are 
proud to have their support and to 
stand with them today.”
Cecile Richards, former president 
of both the Planned Parenthood 
Federation of America and the 
Planned Parenthood Action Fund, 
said there were over 20 rallies held 

in Michigan alone. Richards was 
in Ann Arbor to speak at the Ann 
Arbor Public Library as part of her 
book tour for her recently released 
memoir, “Make Trouble: Standing 
Up, Speaking Out, and Finding the 
Courage to Lead.” Richards was the 
rally’s first speaker.
“I don’t know about you, but 
I will go to jail before I let this 
government tell me what I can 
and cannot do with my own body,” 
Richards said. “That’s a promise to 
you.”
Richards helped found and is 
currently on the leadership board of 
the women’s political action group 
Supermajority, which promises a 
“women’s new deal” addressing 
issues like the wage gap, maternal 
mortality and lack of women in 
government. The group hopes to 
reach 2 million votes in support of 
Supermajority’s platform in the 
2020 elections. 
“This is a fire that is going to 
burn a pathway all the way to the 
White House next year, because we 
are never going to cede our rights 
to politicians — not in Washington 
and not in Lansing, OK?” Richards 
said.
Lori 
Carpentier, 
president 
and CEO of Planned Parenthood 
Advocates of Michigan, followed 
Richards with a speech about the 
importance of maintaining the 
Democratic political momentum 
of the 2018 midterm elections. 
Carpentier said that momentum 
came from anger toward the 2016 
presidential election.

At a press conference 
Thursday afternoon on the 
University 
of 
Michigan-
Dearborn campus, a speaker 
from the One University 
Campaign — a coalition of 
faculty and students from the 
University’s three campuses 
advocating equitable fund-
ing and resource allocation 
across the entire University 
system — said the group has 
had sit-down meetings with 
six out of the eight Univer-
sity regents, at which those 
regents expressed support 
for the coalition’s platform. 
The press conference came 
two hours ahead of a Board 
of Regents meeting, where a 
slate of 1U members would 
speak during the public com-
ment portion.
Abdul El-Sayed, Univer-
sity alum and former guber-
natorial candidate, said at 
the press conference the 
University should adopt 1U’s 
demands to better align with 
its goals of equitability and 
expanding academic oppor-
tunity.
“I’m here today because I 
love the University of Michi-
gan, and because I recognize 
the University of Michigan 
is not just one campus,” El-
Sayed said. “This was always 
intended to be a University 
that provided an ‘uncommon 
education for the common 
individual.’ It had, baked in 
its core, a mission of equity, 
a mission of access to educa-
tional opportunities.”
El-Sayed said the Univer-
sity “leverages” its resources 

toward Ann Arbor students 
by spending approximately 
$54,000 per Ann Arbor 
student each year, but only 
$18,000 and $15,000 at Flint 
and Dearborn, respectively. 
He also said this is a gov-
ernmental issue because the 
state allocates about half 
as much to Flint and Dear-
born per student than in 
Ann Arbor. El-Sayed said he 
is proud to lend his voice to 
1U’s push for a more equita-
ble University.
This conference comes 
one day after 12 state law-
makers — including state 
Sen. Jeff Irwin and state 
Reps. Yousef Rabhi and 
Rebekah Warren, all Demo-
crats representing the Ann 
Arbor area — signed an 
op-ed in the Detroit Free 
Press 
supporting 
“equi-
table” funding across the 
three campuses. The writ-
ers referenced many statis-
tics that lay the foundation 
for 1U’s platform, which 
is fundamentally against 
unequal 
funding 
alloca-
tions from the state for the 
three campuses and a “silo 
system” used by University 
administration for distrib-
uting resources.
Austin 
Ogle, 
a 
U-M 
Flint student and 1U steer-
ing 
committee 
member, 
said his campus has many 
infrastructure issues, like 
broken handicap buttons.
He also said medical and 
legal services available in 
Ann Arbor are not avail-
able in Flint and Dearborn. 

1U: six regents 
have ‘shown 
support’ for
new platform

The University of Michigan 
Board of Regents convened 
in Dearborn, Mich. Thursday 
afternoon for the third meeting 
of the calendar year. University 
President Mark Schlissel began 
the meeting with his address to 
the regents.
Schlissel said a new train-
ing to prevent sexual and 
gender-based misconduct for 
all faculty and staff across the 
three campuses and Michigan 
Medicine is being rolled out 
next week.
“Preventing all forms of sex-
ual and gender-based miscon-
duct remains a top priority for 
the University of Michigan,” 
Schlissel said. “I thank the 
regents for their leadership 
on this important issue and 
the many faculty and staff on 
all three of our campuses and 
Michigan Medicine who are 
contributing to our compre-
hensive efforts to reduce and 
address misconduct for all 
members of our community.”
Schlissel 
also 
welcomed 
new 
Dearborn 
Chancellor 
Domenico Grasso. Regent Ron 

Weiser congratulated Grasso, 
noting how well attended his 
inauguration was.
“As someone who is deeply 
entwined with the Dearborn 
campus, I wanted to express 
my excitement for the campus’s 
future, but also like to congrat-
ulate Dom and thank him for 
his efforts he put forth so far,” 
Weiser said. “We look forward 
to your continued leadership. 
This is really an exciting time 
for the Dearborn campus, and 
I think it’s ready to make that 
next giant leap forward.”
Schlissel also shared that 
Rebecca Cunningham, associ-
ate vice president for research, 
will be named interim vice 
president after Vice President 
Jack Hu leaves to become pro-
vost at the University of Geor-
gia. As it was his last meeting 
with the board, Schlissel said 
Hu’s initiatives have increased 
the University’s standing in the 
field and expanded its engage-
ment with society.
Hu said he was grateful for 
the opportunity to have served 
the University. Though it was 
never his “sandbox dream” 
to become vice president of 
research, he said the people he 
has met over his 34 years at the 

University have enhanced his 
research.
“This 
is 
a 
bittersweet 
moment,” Hu said. “I may be 
leaving Michigan, but Michi-
gan will never leave me. Go 
Blue.”
Schlissel also gave a brief 
overview of the Michigan Road 
Scholars program, which takes 
faculty and staff members 
around the state each year. He 
said this is an example of the 
faculty’s commitment to public 
engagement.
Schlissel then praised the 
University’s sports teams — 
eight of which have earned 
special NCAA recognition — 
for their academic and com-
petitive successes. In the same 
vein, he shared the news of 
 
Head Basketball Coach John 
Beilein’s decision to accept a 
position with the Cleveland 
Cavaliers and thanked him for 
his service to the University.
“Coach Beilein is the win-
ningest coach in program his-
tory, and he represented the U 
of M with impeccable honor 
and integrity,” Schlissel said. “I 
will forever cherish watching 
him from across the court.”
After a faculty presenta-
tion about presidential power 

from 
Mitchel 
Sollenberger, 
Dearborn professor of political 
science and associate provost, 
over 200 faculty from across 
the three campuses and Michi-
gan Medicine were presented 
for promotion. University Pro-
vost Martin Philbert said fac-
ulty play an essential role in the 
University’s service to society.
“One of the Universi-
ty’s great strengths is the 
breadth and depth of our fac-
ulty,” Philibert said. “Each 
year, the review of promo-
tion and tenure casebooks 
reaffirms our appreciation 
for the outstanding work 
of the faculty. It reveals the 
many ways they carry out 
our mission of contributing 
to the state, the nation and 
the world through research, 
teaching and service.”
U-M Dearborn Student 
Government 
President 
Sarah Nasser said she is 
committed 
to 
inclusion 
and 
access. 
Specifically, 
she said she is interested in 
parking reform, expanding 
student services and budget 
equality.

W

hen are we adults? It’s 
something a lot of 
people disagree about, 
and there really isn’t one set 
answer as different freedoms are 
enabled at different ages. 
Let’s look at the ages for distinct 
privileges in Michigan. You can 
get an unrestricted license once 
you turn 17. However, would that 
really count as adulthood? You 
still can’t vote — that comes at 18 
(please register at vote.gov), like 
the ability to be sent off to war 
and pay taxes. Most people would 
probably say adulthood starts 
here, but the problem with that is 
two-fold. First, we have all taken 
introductory classes with 18-year-
olds, and it’s not very controversial 
to claim that they don’t, for the 
most part, carry themselves like 
adults. The second problem with 
adulthood at 18 is that you still 
can’t legally drink in the U.S., 
and the nationwide tobacco age 
is headed here as well. Would 21 
then be a fair adulthood age? I 
don’t think so, and it’s because 
there are two more ages worth 
examining: 11 and 14. 
In 1997, Nathaniel Abraham 
shot and killed Ronnie Greene 
outside 
a 
party 
in 
Pontiac, 
Michigan. 
He 
was 
convicted 
as an adult but sentenced as a 
juvenile and was released upon 
turning 21. He was 11 years old 
when he shot Greene. This is not 
a unique case — Michigan’s laws 
have favored sentencing those 14 
and above to lifetime sentences 
in the case of murder as well as 
similar crimes. This might be too 

common in Michigan. According 
to MLive, one in 10 prisoners 
serving mandatory life sentences 
were 14 to 17 at the time of their 
crime, and 31 percent of juvenile 
lifers did not commit the actual 
homicide. In addition, 69 percent 
of the juvenile lifers are Black.
Obviously, 
there 
are 
racial 
issues that must be addressed in a 
conscious manner, but this gets at 
something much deeper. Different 
castes of people are infantilized or 
over-matured depending on who 
they are and oftentimes where 
in society they come from. There 
are two examples — one more 
age-based and one more racially-
based. 
From the standpoint of age, it 
is somewhat absurd that there is 
a general societal expectation that 
people become adults at 18 given 
how many freedoms you still lack. 
One clear manifestation of this 
is how much more structured 
high school is (both academically 
and otherwise) than a typical 
university. The change is pretty 
drastic, and I do find it somewhat 
amusing 
that 
students 
who 
weren’t allowed to use their phone 
in class seven months prior are 
expected to manage much of their 
life on their own. 
From a racial standpoint, it 
seems 
that 
oftentimes 
Black 
people are unfairly made to appear 
older, and that comes across in 
a number of ways. There’s the 
choice of media to use mugshots 
of Black kids and senior portraits 
of white kids that make one group 
appear older and more deserving 

of punishment. Famously, there 
was a very different response to 
the crack crises of the ’80s and 
’90s (culturally, politically and 
otherwise) than the opioid crisis 
of today which is seemingly 
racially motivated. 
There should be one age for 
adulthood that is applied in a more 
equitable manner, and applied 
to 
everything 
and 
everyone. 
If you allow 18-year-olds who 
serve in the armed forces certain 
privileges not granted to others, 
it becomes clear that this is more 
virtue signaling than it is a serious 
attempt at legislating. Similarly, 
there is no reason to have such 
tough laws regarding minors — 
there is no reason the age where it 
is legal to try someone as an adult 
in Michigan could not be raised 
to a more reasonable one. This 
could address racial imbalances, 
like lifetime sentences given to 
minors. If the age that we want 
to assign adulthood to is 18, then 
on your 18th birthday, you should 
be allowed to drink, light one 
up, fire a gun, mail your ballot in 
and then, when you inevitably 
get arrested for the racket you 
cause by disturbing the peace, 
you should be tried as an adult, 
but not a moment before you’re 
18. Although this might not 
completely address the racial 
issue, holding all minors to the 
same standard might start to 
change societal perceptions of 
people.

Towards a unified theory of adulthood

OLIVIA TURANO | COLUMN
Feminists, enough about men. Let’s talk about women
I 
 

am a proud feminist, supporting 
political, economic and social 
equality regardless of gender that 
has been absent for, really, all of time. I 
too wake up some mornings fighting 
the desire to throw on my pink pussy 
Women’s March hat, slap a new “Pro-
Women, Pro-Life” frame on my Face-
book profile picture, tweet “men are 
trash” and check “crush the patriarchy” 
off the “Feminist with a To-Do List” 
to-do list I bought for $10 at a feminist 
boutique before moving on with my life. 
Much of the recent outcry against 
far-right abortion legislation has been 
because men — usually white, straight 
and wealthy — continue to craft laws 
that are not only incredibly restric-
tive, but also ignore basic female biol-
ogy and public opinion. Alabama’s new 
bill, which passed with the votes of 25 
white, male senators, effectively bans 
abortion at six weeks — earlier than 
many women even know they are preg-
nant — and criminalizes abortion, even 
in cases of rape, where a woman and 
doctor performing an abortion face a 
stronger penalty than a rapist.
Almost 50 years after Roe v. Wade, 
we are still fighting for even the most 
basic access to women’s reproductive 
health. Feminists are quick to turn on 
men and, to be fair, the vitriol against 
them isn’t exactly unwarranted. The 
patriarchy has reigned for too long, and 
women have had enough. 
But, in order to truly tackle the “femi-
nist agenda,” we can’t continue to blame 
our oppression entirely on the patri-
archy and our patriarchs. We need to 
talk about, perhaps, feminism’s primary 
obstacle today: white women.
I am from the Upper West Side of 
New York City, which houses a less 
affluent but still fortunate breed of 
white New Yorkers. Moving from New 
York City to Ann Arbor — another 
upper-middle class, white, liberal haven 
— it was initially hard to conceptualize 
that, despite the persistence of gen-
der inequality across America, white 
women, broadly speaking, are not 
allies of other marginalized groups. 
Amidst a flurry of condemnation 
towards the 25 male state senators 
attempting to control and legislate 
women’s bodies through the new abor-
tion ban in Alabama, there is a smaller 
group pointing out that white women 
remain complicit in promoting these 
laws — women like Alabama state Rep. 
Terri Collins, who sponsored the bill, 
and Governor Kay Ivey, who signed it 
into law. While the law may be legally 
unenforceable due to Roe v. Wade’s 
federal legalization of abortion, this 
law was passed with the intention of 
challenging that decision, emboldened 
by the Trump-era right — and women 
played a role.

This is part of a much bigger issue. In 
the 2016 presidential election, 53 per-
cent of white women voted for Trump. 
By contrast, 94 percent of Black women 
and 69 percent of Latinas voted for Hill-
ary. Even more surprisingly, this wasn’t 
a unique 2016 nightmare phenomenon. 
In fact, this followed a consistent pat-
tern of white women supporting the 
GOP nominee, as they did in the 2004, 
2008 and 2012 elections. 
In the 2018 midterm elections, white 
women followed other demographic 
groups in moving towards the left, 
but only slightly. 49 percent of white 
women voted Republican. Meanwhile, 
92 percent of Black women supported 
Democrats. 
You may be asking why I am so freely 
implying the association between being 
a feminist and voting for Democrats. 
Feminism is not confined to Demo-
crats — in fact, feminism is undeniably 
stronger when it transcends party 
lines. Feminism should and can be 
for everyone. However, as long as the 
goals of feminism are supported by the 
left and largely neglected by the right, 
when white women cast their votes for 
Republicans they are shielded by the 
privilege of their skin color.
While white women walk through 
the streets each day carrying the soci-
etal implications of what it means to 
be female, we are also protected by the 
privilege that being white grants. White 
women stand at a crossroads of being 
female and white, and when they cast a 
vote, they must choose where their pri-
orities lie. And while externally many 
of us may wear shirts that proclaim 
“the future is female,” we often fail to 
address our fellow white women who 
identify with their race before their 
gender.
More often than not in our current 
political climate, voting Republican is a 
privilege not all are afforded. In fact, 42 
percent of women who had abortions 
in 2014 were under the poverty line. 
Wealthy white women will always be 
able to find a way to get an abortion if 
they need one. But for those with weak-
er economic prospects, the attempted 
new legislation is devastating.
Until we, as feminists — and espe-
cially as white feminists — hold white 
women accountable for failing to pri-
oritize women’s issues in their votes, 
feminism will fail to truly take root 
in policy. Without the support of the 
most wealthy and powerful women 
in America, feminism falls short. Fair-
weather feminism is no longer enough 
for white women. Feminism needs 
your full support, now more than 
ever.

M

y story always begins 
with, “My grandfather, my 
Zayde, was a Holocaust 
survivor.” Sometimes I am embar-
rassed by how salient that fact is to my 
identity. I have often pondered how 
strange it is to have an identity rooted 
in tragedy. My perception of myself 
and the way I engage with the world is 
inextricably shaped by the death and 
suffering of so many others relatively 
long ago. Trust me, it’s an awkward 
icebreaker. 
Last month, I walked across the 
Diag on the way to the last class of 
my undergraduate career. I paused to 
wonder how many times I crossed the 
Diag over the last four years. It must 
have been in the hundreds. But what 
about the times I have not crossed? 
The times I entered the Diag without a 
destination on the other side, but with 
the intention to spend time at its cen-
ter?
The first memory that comes to 
mind is the picture I took with my 
sister at her graduation four years 
ago. She had just finished her time at 
the University of Michigan, and I was 
about to begin mine. We took a cute 
picture of her on the ‘M’ while I stood 
behind it, as I had not yet earned the 
right to step on it.
Besides that picture, there were the 
days I spent hammocking in the lawns, 
some occasional moments of doing 
homework or waiting for friends on 
the benches, and times like the morn-
ing of April 29, when I stood in the 
Diag to hear names.
That day, it was Lori Kaye. 
Throughout my time at the Universi-
ty, I have been part of the organization 
Students for Holocaust Awareness, 
Remembrance and Education. Every 
year in April or May, around Yom 
HaShoah — Holocaust Remembrance 
Day — we organize a 24-hour Reading 
of the Names vigil on the Diag. For 24 
continuous hours, students and com-
munity members take half hour shifts 
reading names of victims of the Holo-
caust from a stack of about ten thick 
books — one name at a time. 
In April 2016, I sat on the Diag to 
read names, then again in April 2017 
and again in April 2018.
In October 2018, my friend Zainab 
accompanied me to the Diag to hear 
names. Zainab and I have often bond-
ed over the similarities between her 
Muslim and my Jewish identity. The 
two of us are no strangers to histories 
of marginalization and targeted vio-
lence toward these identities, and we 
have mourned victims of that violence 
together. That day, it was Cecil Rosen-
thal, and ten more names.
In March 2019, I accompanied Zain-

ab to the Diag to hear names. That day, 
it was Mucaad Ibrahim and 49 more. 
I did not linger too long to listen to 
names that day, though, because we 
had to run.
Zainab and I fled the Diag after 
reports of an active shooter in a nearby 
building. We huddled behind a bar-
ricaded door on the fourth floor of 
Hatcher Graduate Library for upwards 
of an hour-and-a-half, repeating, “this 
doesn’t feel real.” Fortunately, it was 
not real. It was a fear-fueled false 
shooter alarm prompted by the sound 
of popping balloons, which coincided 
with a vigil for victims of yet another 
instance of identity-based violence. 
In April 2019, I sat on the Diag 
to read names again. This year, we 
rediscovered some old books from 
past years of the vigil. It was in one 
of these books that I was startled to 
read aloud the name Israel Ringewirtz 
from Nasielsk, Poland. My Zayde’s last 
name was originally Ringewirtz, and 
his father was from Nasielsk. After 
four years of reading so many names 
from so many books, I read the name of 
a family member. The thing about the 
vigil, about every vigil, is that I read 
and hear too many names. They blur 
together. They feel distant. Then sud-
denly, they are close to me again. They 
feel like the attacker is right there on 
the Diag with me, running towards a 
group of Jews, or Muslims or whoever 
has gathered to remember the latest 
victims. Or they are the officer, run-
ning toward us, shouting at us to scat-
ter. 
It didn’t feel real. What a privilege 
that situation was not real. This was 
not the case when my cousin in Cali-
fornia posted those words on Face-
book: “this doesn’t feel real.” 
Zainab texted me. “I heard what 
happened in San Diego. I hope you’re 
doing okay!” I wish we did not have to 
keep trading these words. This time, 
I responded “it was my family’s syna-
gogue so I’m a little shocked.”
Two days later, I stood on the Diag 
to hear a name. That day, it was Lori 
Kaye. This time, there was only one 
degree of separation. 
I have read and heard possibly thou-
sands of names of victims of identity-
based violence in the Diag. It would 
have been 253 more if I had not felt too 
emotionally drained to attend the vigil 
for the victims of the Sri Lanka bomb-
ings.

AKAASH TUMULURI | OP-ED

I

’m an Art & Design student 
in the Penny Stamps School 
of, 
yes, 
Art 
& 
Design. 
Specifically, I’m a Bachelor of Arts, 
not a Bachelor of Fine Arts, in Art 
& Design. As the italicization 
indicates, for us Stampers, that’s a 
big deal. 
B.F.A. students take two-thirds 
of 
their 
coursework 
through 
Stamps and can take IP (Integra-
tive Project) for their senior thesis 
— three credits in the fall and six 
in the winter of independent work 
leading to an exhibition at the end 
of winter semester. They are guar-
anteed their own studios, time to 
work on their body of work from 
September through March and are 
advised by two faculty members 
and one GSI while producing a cul-
minating senior project. 
B.A. students take approximate-
ly two-thirds of their coursework 
outside of Stamps, electives we use 
to inform our art practice. The B.A. 
curriculum exists because, accord-
ing to the Stamps website: 
“As a part of a tier one research 
university, we understand the syn-
ergies that are only possible when 
making and research work togeth-
er as key components of creative 
practice. With over 100 top ranked 
university programs, we can offer 
unparalleled academic opportu-
nities that enrich and deepen our 
students’ creative work.” 
Interdisciplinary studies is one 
of the highlights of Stamps — in 
fact, our dean, Guna Nadarajan, 
gave a speech in April on the ben-
efits of arts and humanities inte-
gration with STEM fields. For B.A. 
students, our senior thesis project 
is supposed to be the culmination 
of that interdisciplinary approach, 
which we chose when we applied 
to the school. This senior thesis 
represents the moment when we 
finally bridge the gap between all 
the LSA and Stamps classes we’ve 
taken for three years. 
Now, possible changes to Senior 
Studio, the revised B.A. Senior 
Capstone, threaten to marginalize 
the opportunity for B.A. students 
to showcase the crossover between 
the skills they’ve learned in Stamps 
and the knowledge they’ve gained 
outside of it. To put it bluntly, B.A. 
students have a problem: we’re 
caught between the ideals of an 
interdisciplinary curriculum and 
the pragmatics of tuition dollars. 
First, I would like to preface that 
some quotes are used anonymous-
ly. This is to protect the faculty and 
students who were so generous in 

providing their input to this essay 
and to acknowledge the past prec-
edent of professional consequences 
in giving this type of input. Second, 
there is no one “to blame.” I’m 
writing this so that students, fac-
ulty and administration can get a 
glimpse into a student’s mind and 
realize that maybe — just maybe — 
students should have a say in stu-
dent matters. At the end of the day, 
this essay is a call for accountabil-
ity more than anything else. 
Let’s start at the end of Win-
ter semester — Monday, April 15. 
Stamps Administration called a 
meeting, open to students, to dis-
cuss the B.A. senior thesis curricu-
lum — B.A. Capstone, as it has been 
referred to in the past, and Senior 
Studio, as was renamed last year by 
the associate dean and dean. This 
coming fall, Senior Studio will be 
an optional, three-credit course 
taught by one professor with no 
GSI support — as opposed to the 
previous four credit, two semester 
program that was offered from 
2015-2018. Our exhibition would 
occur at the end of fall semester 
in December, shortening the work 
year from seven months to three. 
We would have the opportunity 
to be selected for a juried exhibi-
tion in the spring, chosen from the 
senior projects of B.A. and B.F.A. 
students. There is yet no guarantee 
we will get our own studios. 
While the B.F.A.’s senior thesis, 
IP, is referred to as a “program,” 
or part of the curriculum, Senior 
Studio has been classified by the 
Stamps administration as an elec-
tive, which they assert makes it 
possible for them to remove it from 
the curriculum at any moment and 
without faculty consent.
For B.A. students, this feels like 
a marginalization. We are just as 
dedicated to our studio craft as our 
peers. We want the same opportu-
nity to produce the best work pos-
sible, which means being given the 
time and resources to be able to 
produce work of the highest cali-
ber we can. 
In a survey conducted last year 
asking B.A. and B.F.A. alumni what 
changes they’d like to see in the 
senior thesis program, many B.A. 
alumni expressed hope that in the 
future, “B.A. Capstone thesis is not 
treated as a second-class citizen to 
IP.” The alumni also recommend-
ed more credit hours dedicated to 
Capstone and that Capstone stu-
dents be guaranteed studio space. 
The program warrants it. It has 
had full enrollment (17-19 students 

in a course capped at 18) each year 
it has been offered, and is viewed 
as necessary by many faculty 
members. As one faculty member 
explained, “A senior year of IP or 
B.A. Capstone with the senior exhi-
bition as the culminating moment 
— a very public moment — is what 
gives our program teeth and holds 
both our students and ourselves as 
educators accountable. In particu-
lar, I am bothered by the number 
of senior B.A. students who were 
not in the senior exhibition this 
year due to the fact that they were 
not supported properly to have the 
time and space to create work as 
their peers did.” 
Dean Nadarajang appointed an 
IP/Capstone Task Force in 2018-
19 to determine what the senior 
thesis year should be for B.A. and 
B.F.A. students, and this group of 
four Stamps faculty concluded that 
“IP continues as a two-semester 
sequence — 3 credit hours in Fall, 
6 in Winter. BA Capstone contin-
ues as a two-semester sequence 
— 1 credit hour in Fall, 3 in Win-
ter,” and that “All IP and Capstone 
students will be assigned a studio 
space in the fall and shall be part 
of the exhibitions in the Spring.” 
Why, if there was overwhelming 
faculty and student support for 
Capstone, was it downgraded from 
a two semester, four-credit class 
to a one semester, three credit-
class with considerable resources 
revoked? Well, money complicates 
matters.
The budget model for the Uni-
versity states that, as of fiscal year 
2008-09, student tuition, based on 
classes taken, would be distrib-
uted as “an even split (50% - 50%) 
between the unit of enrollment 
and the unit of instruction.” That 
means that if I, a Stamps student, 
take a Stamps class, the Stamps 
School receives 100 percent of the 
portion of my tuition that goes 
toward the credits of that class. 
If I take a class in LSA, 50 per-
cent of that portion of my tuition 
goes toward LSA, and the other 
50 percent goes toward Stamps. 
When your major requires you to 
take more classes outside of your 
school, you can see how the school 
would be economically disincen-
tivized to prioritize your major. 

Don’t BS our B.A.

When I first moved to South-
east Michigan, I was not expect-
ing to find a music scene as active 
and diverse as the one that exists 
today. I grew up in an area where 
our local music scene consisted 
of a few Sublime cover bands, so 
when I moved to Ann Arbor and 
experienced my first basement 
show, it was unlike anything I 
had ever experienced. People here 
really do care about music, and no 
event better represents this fact 
than the infamous BLED FEST.
Starting out as a small basement 
show and pool party, BLED FEST 
has blossomed into a distinct and 
special experience. Taking place 
at the Hartland Performing Arts 
Center (H-PAC), BLED FEST 
invites some of the biggest names 
in punk, rock, indie, metal and 
other genres to perform in an old 
high school gymnasium-turned-
performance-venue. And after 15 
years, the festival is finally com-
ing to a close.
The festival stands out for a 
variety of reasons, but what is 
most notable is how it still incor-
porates a do-it-yourself attitude. 
Although the festival has grown 
quite a bit over the past few years, 
moving from a basement to a per-
forming arts center, the same 
sort of independence and passion 
found in basement shows is still 
very much present today.
In an interview with The Mich-
igan Daily, Nate Dorough, presi-

dent of Fusion Shows and one of 
the chief organizers of the festi-
val, said BLED FEST is “sort of 
like a big family reunion that just 
keeps getting bigger and bigger 
every year.” Dorough attributes 
this atmosphere to the expanding 
diversity of genres present at the 
festival, stating that “back when it 
started, there was a lot of drama 
between punk fans and metal fans 
… but it seems to be a little more 
acceptable now to like rap, metal, 

indie rock and whatever else. As 
we’ve developed the things over 
the past twelve years I’ve been on 
board, there’s been a natural evo-
lution for us to continue to diver-
sify the festival and turn it into 
this esoteric mix of all different 
type(s) of music and walks of life.”
Along with having such a 
diverse lineup, the physical space 
of the festival looks drastically dif-
ferent from that of any other sum-
mer festival. Forget your shades, 
hats and sunscreen, because when 
BLED FEST arrives, school is not 
quite out for the summer yet. “It is 

in an old high school. There are no 
barricades; it’s not your tradition-
al venue where everything is far 
away, everything’s off limits and 
the bands are backstage. Every-
thing’s just sort of mixed in, no 
matter if you’re on- or off-stage,” 
Dorough described.
The festival stays true to its 
roots though, and despite hav-
ing headliners like The Wonder 
Years and Camp Cope, the festi-
val still showcases younger local 
bands on some of their smaller 
stages (one of which used to be an 
actual classroom). Bands from 
Southeast Michigan including 
Dogleg, Ness Lake, The Doozers, 
Complainer. and Mover Shaker, 
each of which already has a dedi-
cated local following, are given 
the opportunity to share the stage 
with over 60 different bands.
In 
addition 
to 
diversify-
ing genres present at the festi-
val, there’s one other aspect the 
organizers have been trying to 
improve. “A few years ago, we 
counted up the bands we had that 
year … and the show was awe-
some, but we noticed that there 
were only like four bands that had 
women in them, and like one band 
that has anyone that wasn’t white 
in it,” Dorough explained. “And we 
kind of had a ‘holy shit’ moment 
where we were like, we’ve got to 
change this.” And just by glanc-
ing through the lineup this year, 
the festival already appears to fea-
ture groups of all different gender 
identities, races and backgrounds.

Fiction — science fiction in par-
ticular — is obsessed with the post-
apocalyptic world. From space 
odysseys to duels with zombies, 
readers and authors alike have a 
strange fascination with the world 
after the end of the world. But, for 
how different each iteration of these 
stories may seem, they all tend to 
follow a clear formula. Reed King’s 
“FKA USA” is no different.
The key to any good post-apoc-
alyptic story is the 
apocalypse 
itself, 
the more popular 
ones being envi-
ronmental destruc-
tion, a public health 
crisis or some ver-
sion of a space race. 
Sometimes, a writ-
er merges all three 
(though, 
granted, 
usually a problem 
in space is closely 
tied to an environ-
mental disaster). In 
“FKA USA,” King 
creates a world wrecked by human-
induced environmental disaster 
and the government’s poor man-
agement of the country. And yet, 
King is still able to draw in readers 
with the detailed history he builds 
around an oversaturated theme in 
science fiction.
Once readers know why the world 
as they know it is over, stories need 
to introduce the who. In “The Hun-
ger Games” there’s Katniss, “Ender’s 
Game” has Ender and “FKA USA” 
introduces Truckee Wallace to the 
growing number of teenagers and 
children contending with a world 
left in ruins by previous genera-
tions. Again, there are specific types 
of heroes in every post-apocalyptic 
world. Truckee is the kind of hero 
who was never meant to be a hero, 
something King highlights by insist-
ing Truckee has no redeeming qual-
ities, despite successfully surviving 
the death trap that is the western 
part of the former United States.
Occasionally, betrayal makes an 
appearance in these types of sto-
ries. And, when the main character 
is betrayed by their close friends, it 

can sting. However, Truckee and 
his friends only share surface-level 
relationships. King doesn’t establish 
a strong connection between them, 
so it wasn’t heart-wrenching when 
Truckee’s friends sold him out to the 
government. What could have been 
an agonizing moment was, instead, 
simply a surprising revelation.
But what is a science-fiction story, 
or a story in general, without a love 
story? At first, it seems like Truckee 
is going to be just another teen-
age boy, pining away for one of his 
friends, but, as the story progresses, 
the love story isn’t really a love story 
at all.
Instead, 
“FKA 
USA” 
explores 
Truckee’s sexuality 
as he grapples with 
his attraction to his 
android friend and 
loses his virginity to 
an android prosti-
tute. Each instance 
of Truckee’s failed 
intimacy 
invites 
further exploration 
of his downfalls, 
especially as he gets 
farther from his 
hometown and dis-
covers the truths about his country. 
Truckee’s story is one laden with sex 
— if he wasn’t a 15-year-old boy try-
ing to understand his relationship 
with women, I would call it misogy-
nistic. That said, I really hope Reed 
King has a better relationship with 
women than his writing would sug-
gest.
Finally, no science-fiction story 
is complete without social com-
mentary. In addition to criticism of 
how we treat the environment, King 
creates a complex world governed 
by corporations. The role of the 
president is played by a CEO, the HR 
department resembles our Congress 
and even the CIA makes an appear-
ance as the research and develop-
ment team of the company. It’s not 
a subtle comparison by any means, 
and it’s obvious that King dislikes 
the power corporations and capital-
ism have in our country. But it’s an 
effective way of forcing his readers 
to confront their understanding of 
our current system, maybe the only 

‘FKA USA’ relies 
on tropes of sci-fi

“Remember when you lost your 
shit and / Drove the car into the gar-
den / You got out and said I’m sorry / 
To the vines and no one saw it,” The 
National’s frontman Matt Berninger 
sings on “I Need My Girl” from Trou-
ble Will Find Me (2013). This is the 
kind of song The National became 
famous for: It creates sentiment 
through pared-down specificity, and 
then it breaks your heart as you sud-
denly imagine the garden, the girl 
apologizing to the vines and the ach-
ing desire fed by this memory. 2019’s 
I Am Easy to Find incorporates these 
defining strengths of The National 
into new methods of storytelling and 
lyrical preoccupations, suggesting 
that it’s possible for a band to mature 
without losing its musical philosophy.
Prior to I Am Easy to Find, The 
National spent seven albums creating 
a sound that can best be described by 
the title of their sophomore effort: Sad 
Song for Dirty Lovers. The National 
should be playing while you sit alone 
at a bar, feeling full of indecipherable 
emotion, or as you look out a window 
and think about people you used to 
be in love with. I Am Easy to Find 
explores a set of situations less excit-
ing and more obscured than anguish 
and melancholia. While some songs 
(“Quiet Light,” for instance) fall back 
on old themes, the album largely 
explores new territory. I Am Easy to 
Find is about what it might mean to 
stay in a romantic relationship, for 
both the partnership itself and the 

individuals involved.
I Am Easy to Find begins with a 
jangly cacophony on “You Had Your 
Soul With You,” the opening bars 
of which are vaguely reminiscent of 
Animal Collective or w h o k i l l-era 
Tune-Yards. Then Berninger croons, 
“You had your soul with you / I was in 
no mood / Drift away, and I could for-
get / I had only one last feather left / I 
wore it on the island of my head,” and 
it becomes clear that The National 
has not lost its way. This song shows 
the band is not afraid to experiment, 
though this is one of the only exam-

ples of a drastically new energy on the 
album.
Songs like “Oblivions” retain 
familiar vocals and instrumentation, 
while lyrics chart an unexplored 
motif: the weight of commitment in 
a long-term relationship. “It’s the way 
you say yes when I ask you to marry 
me / You don’t know what you are 
doing / Do you think you can carry me 
/ Over the threshold / Over and over 
again until oblivion?” This song, like 
most on I Am Easy to Find, features a 
woman’s voice alternately driving the 

narrative or responding to Berninger. 
The album was a joint effort between 
77 musicians, including some of the 
band members’ wives, who contrib-
uted both lyrics and vocals.
The inclusion of women’s per-
spectives is what blows the album 
wide open, providing context and 
counter-arguments for the careful, 
self-deprecating, sad-boy protagonist 
of previous albums. On some songs, 
Berninger can barely be heard, and 
it’s gratifying to imagine these tracks 
as explanations by the women in the 
relationships The National has been 
singing about for all these years.
I Am Easy to Find is also the first 
multimedia effort by The National; 
a short film of the same name was 
made in conjunction with the album 
and directed by Mike Mills, the man 
behind “20th Century Women” 
(2016). In this “I Am Easy to Find,” 
Alicia Vikander (“The Danish Girl”) 
convincingly portrays a woman’s life 
from birth to death without chang-
ing her appearance. This life happens 
within a consistently imagined black-
and-white world, and I Am Easy to 
Find provides a soundtrack that con-
tributes to this sense of containment 
through painstaking and intuitive 
attention to the film’s emotional inte-
rior. While watching the film is not 
necessary for appreciating I Am Easy 
to Find, it does provide a satisfying 
application of the album’s themes to 
a carefully thought-out visual narra-
tive.

2019 has proven quite the roll-
ercoaster of nostalgia for mille-
nials. It started with Vampire 
Weekend’s most recent release 
and continued in a ragged path, 
making the occasional stop for 
the comebacks of artists like 
the Jonas Brothers, and now, a 
revisiting of both Batman and 
the “Twilight” series. (I’m look-
ing at you, Rob.)
It’s a crazy time for pop cul-
ture, as the things that colored 
our youth slowly come back to 
play. Along this wild ride was 
electronic act Passion Pit’s stop 
at the Royal Oak Music The-
ater last Thursday, as front-
man 
Michael 
Angelakos per-
formed 
their 
debut album for 
its tenth anni-
versary. 
It’s 
hard to believe 
it’s 
been 
10 
years since the 
release of mem-
orable hits like 
“Moth’s Wings” 
and 
“Sleepy-
head” on Manners, 
the 
album 
that 
cemented Angelakos’s soaring 
falsetto into the musical con-
sciousness of millions. And yet, 
the songs have marinated with 
time, taking on new meaning in 
the wake of a decade of momen-
tous change.
Angelakos has had a rough 
run in the last few years, begin-
ning with a divorce and con-
tinuing with a struggle against 
mental illness. The artist has 
been outspoken about his bat-
tle with bipolar disorder, one 
that spurred him to form “The 
Wishart Group,” an organiza-
tion offering medical and legal 
services to musicians with a 
special emphasis on mental 
health. Beyond these steps to 
help others, Angelakos has been 
increasingly transparent about 
his own journey in interviews 
and on social media, something 

that did not change for the live 
show.
“When we finished our last 
tour, I wasn’t sure if I’d be able 
to tour again,” the singer admit-
ted, sitting at the front of the 
stage drenched in sweat. He 
adjusted his tie and stood. “But 
I made it, and this has been an 
incredible 
experience.” 
The 
crowd screamed in support and 
Angelakos stood on the moni-
tors, looking out into the sea of 
people clapping and jumping. 
The look in his eyes was one of 
the deepest gratitude I’ve ever 
seen, something that made an 
already frenetic show even more 
profound. Passion Pit’s music is 
a euphoric synthesis of life, and 
Angelakos knows this better 
than anyone. Understanding the 
meaning behind the music made 
it all the more 
special for those 
in 
the 
audito-
rium.
The show was 
a spectacle, but 
on simple terms: 
The band was laid 
in low light at the 
back of the stage, 
accentuating 
Angelakos’ high-
energy 
perfor-
mance with colored 
sparks. He was con-
stantly running across the stage, 
only pausing to take time during 
the most popular songs — namely, 
ones from Manners and the band’s 
sophomore album Gossamer. In 
these pauses, he connected with 
the audience on a deeper level, 
singing directly to those in the 
front row.
Angelakos was clad in his sig-
nature show gear, consisting of 
a shirt, tie and slacks that might 
seem better suited for an office 
than a stage. But this appear-
ance was part of the experience 
at large, in a different way. The 
frontman showed the audience 
that he was one of us, sweat drip-
ping down his white oxford in a 
hazy celebration of life. It was as 
if he had just gotten off work and 
decided to dance his heart out: a 
situation for which Passion Pit’s 
music is absolutely perfect.

The College Board, responsible for 
administering the SAT, announced 
the addition of a new index 
commonly known as an “adversity 

score” in an attempt to quantify a 
student’s overall disadvantage level 
and help college admissions officers 
gather a more complete picture of 
an applicant’s background. The 
University of Michigan was one of 
the 50 universities and colleges who 
piloted the program in the 2018-
2019 admissions process.

University 
spokesman 
Rick 
Fitzgerald said the University plans 
to continue to use the adversity score 
in future admissions decisions.
“We are pleased that the College 
Board is providing additional data 
to institutions that support our 
pursuit of better understanding 
our applicants’ academic potential 

and 
educational 
context,” 
Fitzgerald wrote. “Context matters 
in 
understanding 
the 
myriad 
experiences and adversities that 
our students have encountered 
and still achieved within. Our 
admissions processes benefit from 
this information.”
Officially referred to by the 
College Board as the “Environmental 
Context Dashboard,” the adversity 
score will consider 15 factors relative 
to the student’s home life, local 
community and strength of school 
district. 
Determinants 
include 
poverty rate, local crime rate, 
median income and the availability 
of Advancement Placement classes, 
among others.
Students will not be able to 
view their adversity grade, and 
the information considered in the 
score will be based off data from 
the student’s area, not individual 
information. Students can receive a 
score up to 100, with a higher score 
representing higher adversity.
Colleges among the 50 that have 
adapted this program — in addition 
to the University — include Yale 
College, Florida State University 
and Trinity College.
Critics of the score have taken 
issue with its lack of data on an 
individual level, arguing it could 
potentially overstate or understate 
the adversity a student has faced. 
Similarly, many are concerned the 
score leaves out internal factors 
such as stressors on both physical 

and mental health.
Proponents have said, although 
the score is not a perfect indicator, 
it gives admissions officers a better 
understanding of an applicant’s 
background than they would have 
had without it.
Previous trends in admissions 
at the University show an increase 
in economic and racial diversity. 
According to an October report 
by 
Public 
Affairs, 
2018 
fall 
enrollment 
included 
a 
greater 
proportion of economic diversity 
and 
underrepresented 
students 
with a 14.8 percent increase in 
underrepresented minorities and 
6 percent increase in freshmen 
enrollment from those with incomes 
of $65,000 or less. This uptick also 
follows the implementation of the 
Go Blue Guarantee, an initiative 
granting full tuition coverage for 
in-state University students with a 
yearly income of less than $65,000 
a year.
Many 
have 
compared 
the 
adversity score to affirmative action. 
Affirmative action was questioned 
by some who thought it favored 
people based on the color of their 
skin rather than the merit of their 
actions.
As decided by voters through a 
2006 ballot proposal, Michigan is 
one of eight states with laws making 
the practice illegal.

WARNING: 
SPOILERS 
AHEAD!
Recently I went to go watch 
“Pokémon 
Detective 
Pikachu.” 
Why? I can’t really tell you. For 
context, I’m not a major Pokémon 
fan. Sure I played “Pokémon GO” 
for a little bit, but to be fair I think 
everyone did. My brother was the 
major Pokémon fan growing up, so 
I did spend a fair bit of time watch-
ing Pokémon movies and TV shows 
with him. Every once in a blue moon 
when he was feeling generous, he’d 
even let me play one of his precious 
Pokémon DS Games. 
So mostly due to my brother, 
Pokémon did play some part in 
my childhood but was not signifi-
cant enough for me to feel any pull 
towards this movie when it came 
out. If I’m being honest with myself, 
the only reason why I went to see 
this movie is because the ticket was 
cheap and I had time to spare. 
If you’ve been paying atten-
tion to recent box office sales, then 
you’ll know that “Pokémon Detec-
tive Pikachu” has broken the video 
game movie box office record and 
has also beat “Avengers: Endgame” 
in box offices overseas. Which is no 
small feat, considering “Endgame” 
recently took the worldwide record 

for highest opening weekend gross. 
Needless to say, “Pokémon Detec-
tive Pikachu” has been received 
extremely 
well. 
Many 
people 
watching the movie were probably 
struck by things like the impressive 
use of CGI, the complex character 
arcs and the realistic integration of 
fictional creatures in a world that 
seems so similar to ours.
But the thing that struck me most 
about the film is something that 
hasn’t been a topic of conversation. 
It’s diversity.
To start, the introductory scene 
of the film is two young men of color 
trying to catch a Pokémon.
One of them is Karan Soni, 
an Indian actor known from the 
“Deadpool” franchise, and the 
second is Justice Smith, a Black 
actor known from films like “Paper 
Towns” and the Netflix TV show 
“The Get Down.”
I was immediately excited upon 
seeing that the first two important 
characters introduced in the film 
were people of color, especially 
considering that I never see that in 
action movies.
We go on to learn that the Justice 
Smith plays the main character in 
the film, a 21 year old named Tim 
Goodman who works for an insur-
ance company.
I was completely blown away by 
the fact that Justice Smith was play-
ing the main character in this film, 

because I 100 percent expected the 
main character in this film to be 
white. As that was standard to all 
other films I’ve seen similar to “Poké-
mon Detective Pikachu,” and just 
most of the blockbuster films I watch.

But the main character of this 
film being Black, biracial specifi-
cally, was a casting choice that the 
directors didn’t have to make but 
chose to anyway. Seamlessly too, 
to the point where Tim’s race 

didn’t overshadow his character 
or become a hindrance to him but 
instead just became a fact of his 
identity. Different scenes in the 
movie show Tim’s Black grand-
mother and mother and we get to 
see Tim’s white father for a short 
period of time in the film, but that’s 
the most his race comes into play. 
Tim is built to be a lovable 
character who’s introverted and 
awkward but still finds a sense 
of self-confidence after undergo-
ing a tumultuous journey to find 
his father. He’s funny, imperfect 
and relatable which is a refreshing 
change from the offensive stereo-
types Black characters are often 
made out to be in film and tv.
More than just the casting of 
the main character, the diversity 
of the movie was stood out because 
the majority of the other people in 
the film were people of color. The 
majority of the film takes place in 
Ryme City, a diverse and bustling 
metropolis akin to Tokyo, Japan. 
Throughout the city you could 
spot multiple billboards and glow-
ing signs, just as many in Japanese 
as English. Over 40 percent of the 
people in the city were Asian, pre-
sumably Japanese, and the many of 
the other people held other under-
represented minorities.
For example, the mayor of the 
city was a Black man and the head 
scientist was played by Rita Ora, 

a Yugoslavian singer-songwriter. 
This was all really refreshing, as 
for one, most current movies are 
centered in the western world, not 
in the Eastern Hemisphere. It was 
also refreshing because in most 
films today the majority of people, 
regardless of whether they’re main 
characters or extras, are white.
In this movie, there were only 
about 3 white major characters 
(Ryan Reynolds spends the major-
ity of the movie as a Pokémon, and 
not as Ryan Reynolds, and for so 
he’s not counted within the 3). And 
also, of those three characters, two 
of them were villains. Which was a 
nice change from having people of 
color fulfill the racist villain tropes 
in movies (i.e. Arab terrorists, Afri-
can warlords, Native savages, etc). It 
was appreciated because it showed 
that a character’s “evilness” doesn’t 
have to be conflated with their race 
or a product of it. 
“Pokémon Detective Pikachu” 
is a dynamic film that has made 
giant strides in the video game 
world and in mainstream Holly-
wood for its representative cast-
ing. I loved watching this film 
because it was an unexpected 
chance to see people of my race 
and other minority races well 
represented and I am excited 
to see more films in the future 
that follow “Pokémon Detective 
Pikachu”’s progressive footsteps.

The diversity in ‘Pokémon Detective Pikachu’ spans 
beyond the types of Pokémon

I’ve worked hard to get here, so why do I still feel that I 
have prove myself?

EFE OSAGIE
MiC Senior Editor

I have not raised my hand all class. 
I know what to say; I have something 
worthwhile to share … I want everyone to 
hear what I have to say. I say to myself: 
“Michaela, you can do it. Raise your 
hand. You’ve done this before.” 
It is almost as if I am playing hot potato 
in my head — in the end, I do not raise my 
hand. Another opportunity is missed, and 
I am left scolding myself until the next 
day. 
Why do I feel like I will be laughed at if 
I give an answer to a question during dis-
cussion? Why do I feel that I have to make 
sure that anything I say “sounds intelli-
gent”, so that I can feel that I belong? 

Sometimes it feels as if I have to con-
stantly prove that I am competent enough 
to sit in the same class as other students. 
Coming out of high 
school I knew that 
there would be some 
challenges I would 
have to face because 
my high school was 
severely underfund-
ed; the sky was the 
limit for some, but 
for most, this is was 
untrue. 
Sometimes I do 
muster up the cour-
age to answer a ques-
tion during instruction. I did just this in 
my Biological Anthropology class I built 
up the confidence and cleared my throat. 

I did not flinch or appear nervous when 
I provided an answer. Suddenly, someone 
replies with a scoff: 
“No, I think this is 
the answer” 
This 
moment 
is 
when I realized that 
the feeling of hav-
ing to prove myself 
was reality. And that 
gut wrenching feel-
ing of not feeling good 
enough 
takes 
time 
to cope with — it can 
mess with your mental 
health. Knowing that 
you have worked hard 
in high school with all that was offered to 
you, but realizing that you will always have to 
work ten times harder can be discouraging. 

However, one thing I continue to remember 
as I walk around campus and see other students 
that have similar stories to my own is that we 
are still here. We are going to graduate from the 
University of Michigan, we are going to pass 
that hard class that everyone warns us to never 
take, we are going to succeed even though the 
odds are against us. And even more important, 
as a black woman, I am even more motivated to 
do well because not only do black students make 
up about 4 percent of the population at the Uni-
versity of Michigan, but the graduation reten-
tion rate is lower than our white counterparts.
Though I may have to work a little bit 
harder than others to get an A in a dif-
ficult class, I am learning to understand 
that working harder does not mean that I 
am not competent enough, but rather that 
I am determined to accomplish the goals 
— no matter what.

During 
March, 
April 
and 
much of May, it looked as if the 
Michigan 
softball 
team 
overcame 
the 
glaring 
weakness that 
kept it from 
succeeding in 
February.
But 
at 
the 
NCAA 
Regional, 
the 
15th-seeded 
Wolverines’ inability to hit with 
runners on base resurfaced. And 
this time, it proved fatal.
Up until this past weekend, 
the season was unfolding like a 
fairytale. After dipping below 
.500 at least six games into a 
season for the first time in nearly 
two decades and posting a 5-9 
record against eventual NCAA 
Tournament teams, the problem 
was clear. Michigan’s inability 
to hit with runners on base led to 
narrow losses against then-No. 7 
Arizona, No. 9 Louisiana State, 
Louisville and North Carolina.
Whenever 
the 
Wolverines 
put runners aboard, their bats 
fell silent. That problem kept 
Michigan from winning tight 
games. That problem kept the 
program off the national radar. 
That problem had the country 
wondering if it was the end of an 
era.
After 
an 
uncharacteristic 
February for the program, the 
Wolverines rallied behind their 
five seniors — all of which took 
vastly different paths to the 
starting lineup. They won 33 of 
their next 34 games, highlighted 
by an outright Big Ten regular 
season 
championship 
and 
conference tournament title.
As it turned out, that resume 
was just enough for Michigan 
to host its first NCAA Regional 
since 2016, when advancing on 
home turf ignited a run to the 
Women’s College World Series.
The dominoes had fallen into 
place. For the first time since 
their 
freshman 
season, 
the 
Wolverines’ seniors would play 
NCAA Tournament softball on 
their own diamond. During the 
regular season, Michigan posted 
a perfect 15-0 record at home. It 
seemed as though the stars had 
aligned for this fairytale’s next 
chapter.
Instead, 
the 
Wolverines’ 

February demon derailed the 
storyline. In 26 innings against 
James Madison ace Megan Good, 
who has the lowest ERA and most 
career wins of any active NCAA 
player, they scored just two runs. 
That’s not for lack of opportunity, 
though, as Michigan stranded a 
staggering 23 baserunners.
The 
three 
games 
against 
the Dukes were decided by a 
total of five runs, amplifying 
the importance of each missed 
opportunity. 
As 
baserunners 
trotted back to the dugout without 
crossing home plate at the end of 
each inning, the shortcomings 
grew more noticeable.
Thanks to sophomore left-
hander Meghan Beaubien’s 12 
shutout innings on Saturday, 
the problem initially flew under 
the radar. The excitement of 
winning Saturday’s thriller took 
the focus off the Wolverines’ 
glaring 
weakness. 
But 
after 
Sunday’s rainout washed away 
those emotions, Michigan fell 
victim to the same shortcomings 
on Monday.
Only needing to beat James 
Madison 
once 
more, 
the 
Wolverines first faltered with 
runners on base in the third 
inning. With two outs, senior 
outfielder Natalie Peters stepped 
into the batter’s box with runners 
on first and second base. She 
laced a line drive at Dukes’ third 
baseman Hannah File, who made 
the catch to end the threat and 
preserve the scoreless tie.
An inning later, Michigan 
loaded the bases with only one 
out. Trailing by one run this 
time 
around, 
the 
Wolverines 
appeared 
bound 
to break through 
against 
Good. 
Just 
about 
any 
ball in play had 
the potential to 
tie the game, but 
a shallow pop up 
and 
groundout 
kept Michigan off 
the scoreboard.
Postseason opportunities tend 
to be scarce, so coughing up 
two golden chances to pounce 
on Good was a tough pill for the 
Wolverines to swallow.
“Timely hitting is the name 
of the game in any game and 
especially in the postseason,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 
Carol 

Hutchins. “And they’re tough to 
come by on both sides. We just 
needed one more. … We never 
seemed to get it going. We didn’t 
put things together until late 
and it just wasn’t 
enough.”
When 
the 
dust settled, the 
sum 
of 
those 
stranded runners 
was 
too 
much 
to overcome. By 
the end of the 
regional, 
the 
Wolverines were 
the nation’s only 
seeded team that 
failed to advance.
Some are quick to point the 
finger to a weak conference, 
which could theoretically leave 
Michigan ill-prepared to face 
a team of James Madison’s 
caliber in the postseason. Prior 
to conference play, 13 of the 
Wolverines’ first 19 games came 

against teams ranked top-36 in 
RPI — a group that includes just 
four Big Ten teams.
The catch? Michigan played 
none of those Big Ten teams until 
May. That left two 
months 
between 
competitive 
opponents.
But the Dukes 
found themselves 
in the same boat, 
only to a more 
extreme 
degree. 
Outside of James 
Madison, only one 
Colonial Athletic 
Association team 
finished top-120 in RPI, and 
that was Elon at a lackluster No. 
68. In five meetings, the Dukes 
outscored the Phoenix by 36 runs. 
Like the Wolverines, they saw 
next to no competition between 
mid-March and mid-May.
It didn’t come down to how 
well 
each 
team’s 
conference 

slate 
prepared 
them 
for 
postseason play. It came down 
to a competitive edge. A clutch 
gene. A willingness to seize the 
moment. 
On 
Monday, 
James 
Madison came up 
with the big hits 
that 
Michigan 
couldn’t.
For 
all 
that 
a 
Big 
Ten 
championship 
and 
conference 
tournament 
title 
are worth, 2019’s 
lasting 
memory 
may 
be 
what 
could’ve 
been. 
The opportunity was there for 
the taking.
Just when the inability to hit 
with runners on base seemed 
like a distant memory, it became 
the 
fairytale’s 
villain. 
The 
Wolverines couldn’t overcome it 
this time, and a good season fell 
just short of great.

For John Beilein, his time at Michigan leaves a lasting impact

CLEVELAND 
— 
This 
is 
normally enemy territory for 
John Beilein.
The former Michigan men’s 
basketball 
coach 
shared 
a 
laugh with the media at his 
introductory press conference 
after 
calling 
Michigan 
“the 
greatest university in the world.”
“Some of you Ohio State 
people may not agree with that,” 
Beilein said.
Though his new role as head 
coach of the Cleveland Cavaliers 
may garner him an “Ohio man” 
by some, Beilein spoke candidly 
about his 12 years in Ann Arbor 
and the impact the support of 
the students had on his time with 
the program. For Beilein, the 

admiration between himself and 
the students was mutual.
“One thing I wish, I wish that 
I was able to get to know even 
more of the students during 
that time,” Beilein said after 
his 
introductory 
press conference. 
“I wish I could 
have been with 
(the 
students) 
sometimes when 
(they) 
were 
watching some of 
our games. I hope 
(they) realize they 
are at the greatest 
university in the 
world and it’s this 
unique blend between athletics 
and students, brilliant students, 
that is like no other.”
Throughout 
his 
press 

conference, he often referred 
to Michigan as “we” and “the 
greatest university in the world” 
signifying that his time at the 
university left an indelible mark 
on his experience as a coach. 
Beilein 
was 
arguably the most 
beloved coach in 
program history. 
Immediate 
reactions 
from 
students to him 
leaving 
were 
a 
mixture 
of 
sadness 
and 
frustration, 
but the success 
and 
passion 
he 
brought forth for the program 
was rarely in question.
Beilein made it crystal clear 
at his press conference that the 

decision to leave the Wolverines 
was one of the most difficult he’s 
ever had to make as a coach –– 
and perhaps the last job change 
he will have to make. 
“I hated leaving a great place 
like the University 
of 
Michigan,” 
Beilein said. “It 
could only be for 
something special 
like this.”
The 
opportunity was 
one he could not 
pass on, though, 
and 
he 
knew 
once he made the 
decision to leave, 
it would be a hard pill to swallow 
for fans and the program, alike.
“The timing was really bad, 
but there’s never going to be 

a good time,” Beilein said. “I 
just don’t know how you end 
coaching college basketball if 
you’re successful with the timing 
right. It’s impossible.”
Added Beilein: “I said I’m 
going 
to 
do 
it 
and 
hopefully 
all of the good 
things that you 
accomplished 
at 
Michigan 
will 
be what you’ll be 
remembered by.”
Though 
his 
new home court 
now 
resides 
167 
miles 
away 
from the Crisler 
Center, Beilein emphasized that 
the impact that the Michigan 
community had on him is one he 
will always cherish.

JORGE CAZARES
Summer Managing Sports Editor

Beilein excited for the long-term development that NBA offers

CLEVELAND — If there was 
one thing that separated former 
Michigan coach John Beilein 
from the rest of the pack at the 
collegiate level, it was his ability 
to teach and develop his players 
— the same quality that made 
him the clear frontrunner for 
the Cleveland Cavaliers head 
coaching job last week.
Beilein’s reputation as someone 
who could extract the most out of 
each and every one of his players 
was something Cavaliers’ general 
manager Koby Altman said he 
looked for, in addition to the 
common qualities he considered 
to be in a great head coach: 
culture driver, leader, innovator 
and communicator.
“Coach Beilein checked all 
(the) boxes to the point where, 
after our initial meeting, some of 
my guys were looking at us like, 
‘What are we doing here? This is 
our guy,’” Altman said. “On top 
of that, just his incredible track 
record in player development.”
Known 
as 
someone 
who 
treasures the opportunity to 
watch his players grow, Beilein 
was often unable to keep players 
for longer than a couple years due 
to their tendencies to depart for 

the pros after spending a short 
time in college. As a result, he 
preached on how he recruited 
players who didn’t treat college 
simply as another stop between 
making it to the NBA.
With Cleveland, Beilein can 
capitalize on player retention 
for years to come — a luxury that 
was scarce to come by with his 
previous jobs.
Rather 
than 
worrying 
about 
whether a player 
will 
make 
the 
jump 
to 
the 
professional level 
after one breakout 
year, he can focus 
on 
continuous 
development. 
Perhaps an even 
greater incentive 
is that he can 
spend the offseason with the 
current roster rather than going 
out to find new recruits like 
he was forced to do so in the 
collegiate scene.
“When you have a kid that is 
a freshman and is a very good 
player and you only get him one 
year, I’m back to coaching junior 
college again, so it is nice,” Beilein 
said. “The relationships that I 
have with the Duncan Robinson’s 
and even (Moritz Wagner) for 

three years and Muhammad-Ali 
(Abdur-Rakhman) and Jordan 
Morgan, those guys, Caris LeVert 
was four years, those are special 
relationships. But you don’t have 
enough of it when (players) leave 
so early.”
Beilein thinks that Cleveland 
boasts some of the best young 
talent in the league. With point 
guard Collin Sexton at the helm 
accompanied 
by a plethora of 
weapons who also 
have 
significant 
room 
to 
grow, 
Beilein noted that 
he would not only 
have the privilege 
of helping these 
players 
achieve 
their goals, but he 
would get to stick 
around them for 
more than just one or two years.
The 
learning 
experience 
doesn’t just stop with the youth 
of the team. Though many players 
develop the most during college 
as well as their first few years in 
the league, Beilein will finally 
get the chance to teach players 
much older than those in college, 
something he’s never done before.
“You never stop learning,” 
Beilein said. “You never stop 
getting better and that will be 

even with our veteran players. 
We’ll still be working at the little 
things, the skill-level things, 
because you got to keep evolving 
in this game. But if things 
continue, I think it’s (2021), no 
one-and-done, they’re gonna be 
the same players pretty soon that 
we’ve been developing.”
And as far as Beilein’s tenure 
with the Cavaliers simply being 

a 
short-lived 
rebuild 
similar 
to those of recent Cleveland 
coaches, he quickly put that 
notion to rest.
“We’re gonna take our time 
here. We’re gonna put no labels, 
we’re gonna put no limits on this 
team. We’re just going to do our 
best every day. I’m a huge growth 
mindset guy, that every day, we’re 
just gonna grow a little bit more.”

Wilson remains uncommitted, says Howard will “bring a big spark”

When 2019 four-star Jalen Wilson 
decommitted from Michigan last 
week, it continued a month-long 
downward spiral for the Wolverines. 
Jordan Poole and Ignas Brazdeikis 
unexpectedly left for the NBA before 
John Beilein shook the basketball 
world by following suit. Then, with 
Wilson’s decommitment, Michigan 
lost its top-ranked incoming signee.
Six days later, the Wolverines 
have found Beilein’s replacement, 
hiring Juwan Howard as their new 
head coach in a move Wilson said 
will “bring a big spark to the school.”
For now, though, Wilson, the 
50th-ranked overall recruit in the 
2019 class according to 247Sports’ 
composite 
rankings, 
remains 
uncommitted.
“I still got the same business,” 

Wilson told The Daily. “It’s not 
gonna change everything. It’s a new 
coach so he’s gonna have to recruit 
and do all the business all over again 
like everybody else, really.”
Wilson 
originally 
committed 
to Michigan as a junior last May 
before signing his letter of intent on 
Nov. 14. When Wilson re-opened 
his recruitment, the most likely 
destinations appeared to be Kansas 
and North Carolina, two schools that 
Wilson has official visits scheduled 
with in the next two weeks.
However, Wilson never ruled 
out Michigan, telling The Daily last 
week that, “I’m always considering 
(Michigan). I just had to do this to 
look at the bigger picture as a backup 
plan. I can’t rely on someone if I don’t 
know they’re gonna be there or not.”
His 
potential 
recommitment 
could 
hinge 
on 
whether 
the 
Wolverines retain their current 

assistant coaches, especially Luke 
Yaklich, who has been his lead 
recruiter. 
Yaklich, 
though, 
has 
received heavy interest from Texas 
for an assistant coaching vacancy.
Despite 
the 
uncertainty, 
the 
Wolverines’ 
assistants 
have 
remained in contact with Wilson 
since Beilein’s departure.
“(The communication has been) 
the same,” Wilson said. “Keeping the 
relationship good, keep it ongoing 
and telling me to remain calm and 
stuff like that. … They just told me 
they understood everything, why 
I decommitted and that they were 
always gonna be there for me if I ever 
needed to come back.”
Wilson has not been contacted 
by anyone at Michigan regarding 
Howard’s hire, as of Wednesday 
afternoon. However, last week, he 
told The Daily that he wanted to see 
the Wolverines hire “A coach that 

will come in and keep the top-tier 
program like it is and a coach that’s 
not going to change the culture of 
Michigan because it’s such a great 
school and it’s such a unique school.”
And with one of its most 
celebrated alumni coming back to 

Ann Arbor, Michigan might have 
done just that.
“Juwan Howard was a great 
player and a great face for Michigan,” 
Wilson said. “And now that he’s 
the head coach, I feel like it’ll really 
bring a big spark to the school.”

Juwan Howard to inherit question marks with Wolverines

Just a month ago, shortly after 
losing to Texas Tech in the Sweet 
Sixteen, 
the 
Michigan 
men’s 
basketball team began popping up on 
“way too early” top-10 lists.
At that point, there was no reason 
to doubt that the Wolverines would 
be a top-level program. But that 
was before guard Jordan Poole and 
forward Ignas Brazdeikis decided 
to stay in the NBA Draft. That was 
before top recruit Jalen Wilson 
decommitted. That was before Hall 
of Fame-worthy coach John Beilein 
left for the Cleveland Cavaliers.
But that’s why any top-10 list made 
in April is necessarily deemed “way 
too early.” Now, the program new 
coach Juwan Howard will inherit is 
just a remnant of the one near the top 
of such lists.
The Daily breaks down the 
situation 
Howard 
walks 
into 
entering the summer.
Roster
The Wolverines retain their core 
of point guard Zavier Simpson and 
center Jon Teske. Last year, the two 
were among the leaders of the team, 
defensive stalwarts who were also 
key components of Michigan’s ball 
screen-heavy offense. Simpson and 
Teske, both incoming seniors, are 
unlikely to transfer, but they were 
two players who were so good partly 
because of Beilein’s system, and 

under another system, they may not 
perform at the level they did last year 
— when Simpson was named to the 
All-Big Ten second team and Teske 
was an honorable mention.
Forward 
Isaiah 
Livers, 
who 
played primarily at the backup 
power forward and center positions 
last year, will also take a larger role, 
though he is likely to play more on the 
wings than he did with Brazdeikis, 
Matthews and Poole. Livers is 
currently Michigan’s only reliable 
returning shooter — shooting 43 
percent from three, mostly in spot-
up situations.
Beyond 
those 
three, 
the 
Wolverines’ roster is thin. Their 
returning 
scholarship 
players 
include guards David DeJulius, Eli 
Brooks and Adrien Nunez, forward 
Brandon Johns and centers Colin 
Castleton and Austin Davis. None 
played 
significant 
minutes 
last 
year, and any could be at risk of 
transferring, especially if Howard 
does not retain Beilein’s assistants.
Jaron Faulds, a preferred walk-
on forward who transferred from 
Columbia, will be eligible in 2019 
after sitting out last season. Other 
walk-ons who received playing time 
last season include guards Rico 
Ozuna-Harrison and Luke Wilson 
and forward CJ Baird.
Recruiting
When Jalen Wilson decommitted 
on May 16, it left Michigan with just 
one commitment in the class of 2019 

— wing Cole Bajema. Bajema has 
still remained committed, though he 
could still decide to look elsewhere if 
he sees the new coaching situation 
as unfavorable. Wilson has also left 
the possibility of recommitting open, 
though it seems less likely after he 
scheduled official visits with Kansas 
and North Carolina, both of which 
have stable coaching situations.
Howard will likely look to the 
graduate transfer market to fill a 
spot or two. Jaevin Cumberland, 
a grad transfer from Oakland, had 
expressed interest in the Wolverines 
and still remains uncommitted, 
and others on the market could 
still decide they are interested in 
potentially playing under Howard.
There are also a few 2019 
prospects still uncommitted that 
Howard could try to go after, 
though Beilein’s mid-May departure 
means there are no guarantees. 
Howard’s cousin is top recruit Jaden 
McDaniels. Some believed he could 
come to Michigan if Howard got the 
job, however, McDaniels committed 
to Washington on Tuesday night, 
making that prospect significantly 
less likely. Franz Wagner — the 
younger brother of former Michigan 
player Moe Wagner — also took his 
official visit last week, albeit while 
the Wolverines were without a head 
coach. He hasn’t completely closed 
the door on coming to Ann Arbor, 
but with an offer waiting from 
professional club Alba Berlin, that 

too seems unlikely.
With 
Beilein’s 
departure 
happening this late in the cycle, 
it is quite possible that Michigan 
will have to go shorthanded in the 
upcoming season.
The 
Wolverines’ 
lone 
2020 
commit is guard Zeb Jackson. 
Jackson has expressed concern 
about Howard’s lack of experience 
as a head coach, but he remains 
committed now. With plenty of 
time until he needs to make a final 
decision, Howard will have time to 
attempt to win him over as well as 
recruit new players for the cycle. He 
has never recruited before, but his 
pedigree as a member of the Fab Five 
and as a long-tenured NBA player 
and assistant could help. Howard 
also has family members currently 
on the AAU circuit, which could aid 
him in building connections.
Assistants
Michigan’s 
three 
current 
assistants — DeAndre Haynes, Saddi 
Washington and Luke Yaklich — are 
all beloved by players and recruits. 
Howard now faces the choice to 
retain them or bring in his own staff. 
The assistants, too, have a decision 
to make — remain in Ann Arbor or 
go searching for a job with more 
guarantees?
Yaklich has already begun that 
search, with 247Sports reporting 
that he interviewed for a job at Texas 
under coach Shaka Smart. This 
doesn’t mean he will leave, as coaches 

often use such interviews as leverage 
to get a raise or simply decide not to 
move. Yaklich’s son will be a senior at 
Saline High School just outside Ann 
Arbor in the fall, and Yaklich could 
opt for more stability for his family.
Still, 
Beilein 
was 
primarily 
an offensive coach who was less 
experienced on the other side of the 
ball — hence Yaklich’s necessity. 
Howard is primarily a defensive 
coach and may be looking for a top 
offensive assistant, which could 
lessen the need for Yaklich. Howard 
also primarily worked with the 
big men during his tenure as an 
assistant coach with the Miami 
Heat, which calls into question the 
role Washington — the bigs coach — 
would play.
The 
more 
assistants 
the 
Wolverines can retain, the less their 
roster will be in flux. Keeping some 
or all of Haynes, Washington and 
Yaklich around would help maintain 
commitments from recruits and 
keep players from transferring. But 
it’s possible that Howard will want 
to work with coaches who have 
different specialties, and it’s equally 
possible that the current assistants 
will want to go somewhere that is 
less of an unknown.
Coaches, 
like 
everyone 
else, 
operate under their own best 
interests, and those interests may 
not align with what’s best for the 
program. If so, Howard will have one 
more thing to worry about.
