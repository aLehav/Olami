As resident advisers prepare to strike 

in protest of the University of Michigan’s 
response to COVID-19, some members of 
Residential Staff say the pandemic has 
forced long-time issues between University 
Housing and the student staff into the open.

ResStaff, or the students who work for 

University Housing, are calling for stronger 
communication and increased COVID-19 
protections. Several ResStaff workers told 
The Daily they have privately complained 
for years about a disconnect between 
University Housing and the students who 
work for them, but say the pandemic has 
made the situation even more urgent. 

RAs are calling to attention the disconnect 

between University Housing, which makes 

policy regarding COVID-19, and members of 
ResStaff, who implement it. 

RAs’ contract includes a clause stating 

they are not allowed to publicly disagree 
with University Housing policies. Because 
of this, two current RAs and a student who 
quit the position from COVID-19 concerns 
have requested to remain anonymous for 
fear of retaliation from the University. They 
will be referred to as Olivia, Emily and 
Noah, respectively. 

Personal Protective Equipment and 

Enforcement

Custodians have been working since 

early July to prepare rooms for students, 
Daniel Henne, director of communications, 
marketing and design for Student Life, 
wrote in an email to The Daily. Custodial 
staff clean the bathrooms two times a day 

and ensure hand sanitizer and disinfectant 
wipes are readily available, Henne said.

But many RAs said that these protective 

measures were not enough for buildings 
filled with new students from different 
states, including some COVID-19 hotspots. 
They pointed to Cornell University, where 
RAs asked for plexiglass dividers between 
sinks and additional sanitation near heavily 
congested areas, like elevators.

University Housing said they would not 

put up plexiglass dividers between sinks, 
stating the decision was consistent with 
other campus buildings. Amir Baghdadchi, 
Senior Associate Director of Michigan 
Housing, said the University has taken other 
precautionary measures, like placing social 
distancing signs in bathrooms and installing 
paper towel dispensers throughout campus.

GRADUATE 
STUDENTS 
PICKET

ADMINISTRATION

Speaking from the steps of the Michigan 

Union Friday afternoon, graduate student 
instructor Chris Campbell called on 
University of Michigan administrators to 
“do the right thing, probably for the first 
time.”

“Stop talking about the law and the 

cops, stop talking about listening to us,” 
Campbell said. “Listen to us about what 
it takes for a safe and just response to a 
pandemic and to policing on this campus.” 

Five days into the graduate students’ 

strike and amid other labor actions on 
campus, Campbell was one of hundreds 
of 
University 
students, 
faculty 
and 

staff who spoke out Friday against the 
administration’s response to COVID-
19. Various open letters, speak-outs and 
protests occurred throughout the day, 
in-person and online.

The Graduate Employees’ Organization 

went on strike Monday, demanding more 
COVID-19 protections and a reduction in 
policing on campus.

SCHLISSEL 

RESORTS 
TO COURT

LEGAL

A day after the Graduate Employees’ 

Organization voted to extend its strike, 
University of Michigan President Mark 
Schlissel is seeking an injunction to get 
graduate students off the picket lines and 
back to teaching.

Schlissel is asking Washtenaw County 

Circuit Court to require GEO members 
to return to work by issuing a temporary 
restraining 
order 
and 
a 
preliminary 

injunction. In a video released Monday 
afternoon, he described the request as a 
necessary step. 

“Following the announcement that GEO 

will continue to strike and not teach for at 
least five more days, I made the very difficult 
decision to seek help from the courts so we 
can resume all of our remote and in-person 
classes,” Schlissel said in the video. “We 
welcome the opportunity to discuss the 
issues that GEO has raised. The University’s 
offer to continue talks remains open. 
What we cannot welcome is the profound 
disruption to the education we’ve promised 
our undergraduate students.”

PRESIDENTIAL IMPEACHMENT, 

FROM JOHNSON TO TRUMP: 
WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED?


When 
LSA 
junior 
Sam 

Burnstein 
arrived 
at 
the 

University 
of 
Michigan’s 

quarantine 
housing 
at 

Northwood apartments, he was 
underwhelmed by what he found. 

“When 
walking 
into 
the 

apartments here, the whole time 
I kept thinking, ‘This feels like 
a big afterthought,’” Burnstein 
said. “It feels like the University 
had, like, two or three weeks till 
the school year starts and they’re 
like, ‘Oh, we need somewhere 
to put these students,’ because 
everything 
was 
just 
very 

haphazardly thrown together.” 

In 
an 
effort 
to 
contain 

the spread of COVID-19, the 
University has told students who 
test positive for the virus, are 
symptomatic or were in close 
contact with someone who tested 
positive to isolate or quarantine 
for up to two weeks. 

But students in University-

provided quarantine housing on 
North Campus have expressed 
concerns 
about 
what 
they 

describe as a lack of sanitation, 
the low quality of the meal 
delivery service and insufficient 
communication between them 
and the University.

Students who live in residence 

halls and test positive for the 
virus are required to quarantine 
or isolate at apartments on 
North Campus, return to their 

permanent residence or book a 
room at a local hotel. If a contact 
tracer discovers that a student had 
close contact with a COVID-19 
positive individual, the exposed 
student is also instructed to go 
into quarantine. 

In an email to The Daily, 

University 
spokesperson 
Kim 

Broekhuizen said students are 
not required to stay in University-
provided housing. 

“Students who need to isolate 

or quarantine are not required to 
observe that period in a university 
unit; some students choose to go 
home, others might choose a local 
hotel,” Broekhuizen wrote. “The 
university provides quarantine 
and isolation housing so students 
have a place to live, safely, outside 
of 
their 
regular 
residential 

community.” 

According to University data 

on 
quarantine 
and 
isolation 

housing, as of Monday morning, 
20 people were in isolation with 
a positive test result and 39 
were in quarantine after having 
been exposed or awaiting a test 
result. Nearly 10 percent of the 
quarantine and isolation housing 
was full. 

Unsanitary 
housing 

conditions

Four 
students 
told 
The 

Daily that upon arrival, their 
apartments at Northwood were 
unsanitary. 
LSA 
freshman 

Rochelle Smith said she found 
hair on the bed and on the floor 
as well as in the bathroom sink, in 
addition to cobwebs with spiders 

in the unit. 

Smith moved to Northwood 

after 
a 
student 
who 
tested 

positive reported her name to a 
contact tracer. She said she was 
told to quarantine for two weeks 
even if she tested negative. 

While she was provided with 

a number to call for complaints, 
she decided not to report the 
condition of her apartment. After 
one day at Northwood, Smith 
returned to her parents’ home to 
quarantine there. 

In a message to The Daily, 

Engineering 
sophomore 
Cate 

Sullivan said there was crusted, 
used soap in her shower and the 
apartment’s door lock was broken 
when she arrived. 

“It’s 
quarantine 
housing,” 

Sullivan 
said. 
“It 
probably 

should be cleaned well between 
residents.”

Broekhuizen 
outlined 

the 
cleaning 
procedures 
for 

quarantine rooms in her email to 
The Daily. 

“Student Life Facilities cleans 

and sanitizes each unit before 
and after each use, using EPA-
regulated 
cleaners 
certified 

as 
effective 
against 
germs 

and 
viruses,” 
Broekhuizen 

wrote. “This is an enhanced 
cleaning protocol put in effect 
for all residential units since 
March. After a student leaves 
a quarantine room, Facilities 
disinfects the room 7 days later, 
after which time the next student 
may get assigned. The timeline is 
based on CDC guidelines.”

According to Sullivan, the 

Division of Public Safety and 
Security opened her apartment 
unit to check if someone was 
there when she moved in and 
later 
walked 
into 
her 
unit 

unannounced. 

“When I arrived, DPSS knocked 

and asked if anyone was inside, 
checked the apartment, then said, 
‘It’s all set,’ like they didn’t know 
if it was gonna be empty or not,” 
Sullivan said, adding that later 
on, “DPSS randomly entered my 
apartment without knocking or 
asking. When they saw me, they 
said sorry and left without an 
explanation.”

Central Student Government 

President Amanda Kaplan and 
Vice President Saveri Nandigama 
wrote a letter to students living 
in quarantine housing giving 
them more details on cleaning 
procedures.

“Each room remains empty 

for a week after a student leaves 
quarantine and it is cleaned 
between students,” the letter said. 
“We are currently working to 
ensure that cleaning procedures 
are specified and documented 
upon 
a 
student’s 
arrival 
to 

quarantine housing.” 

According to the Campus Maize 

& Blueprint website, custodians 
clean the facilities’ high-traffic 
surfaces.

“These disinfectants will be 

regularly applied to frequently 
touched surfaces such as door 
knobs and handles, door push 
plates and crash bars, light 
switches, sink and faucet handles, 
elevator handles and more,” the 
website states.

Lack of supplies
Students moving to Northwood 

received an email from Eric 
Aiken, 
assistant 
director 
of 

student leadership for Michigan 
Housing, regarding their move-in. 
This email, obtained by The Daily, 
has a section titled “For your 
comfort” 
suggesting 
students 

pack items such as bedding, hand 
soap, bathroom toiletries, cooking 
materials and a trash can. Students 
were also told to bring two weeks 
of clothing because there are no 
laundry facilities available. 

Four students told The Daily 

they were given anywhere from 
20 minutes to eight hours to pack 
their belongings before they were 
transported to Northwood by 
DPSS.

Burnstein 
posted 
a 
now-

viral Tik Tok on Friday about 
the conditions in Northwood 
quarantine housing. As of Monday 
morning, Burnstein’s Tik Tok has 
racked up nearly 90,000 likes on 
Tik Tok. 

“We were given almost no 

supplies, we were given no 
food, no masks, no gloves, no 
microwave, no bedsheets, no soap, 
no cleaning supplies, no nothing,” 
Burnstein said in the Tik Tok. 
He also challenged University 
President Mark Schlissel to spend 
a night in quarantine housing.

Burnstein told The Daily he 

had about two to three hours 
to pack his belongings before 
being transported to Northwood 
by DPSS. He said he does not 
recall receiving an email about 
suggested items to pack. 

Music, Theatre and Dance 

freshman Joseph Bickel said he 
received limited supplies when 
he arrived in quarantine housing. 
When he requested items such 
as trash cans, paper plates, toilet 
paper and garbage bags, he said it 
took more than a day to get them. 

Kaplan 
and 
Nandigama 

addressed the lack of supplies in 
their letter. They said they are 
currently working on ensuring 
that students are provided with 
necessary 
supplies, 
including 

personal protective equipment, 
upon arrival.

“Students will now be provided 

with 
bar 
soap, 
toilet 
paper, 

shampoo, trash liners, trash can, 
sheets, pillow, pillowcase (and) 
microwaves,” the letter said.

“Central Student Government 

is currently working with the 
Dean of Students office and 
MDining to provide individual 
pots and pans for each student.” 

Dissatisfaction with meal 

service

In addition to issues with 

the cleanliness of the rooms, 
students 
isolating 
expressed 

dissatisfaction with the meal 
service. Students are instructed 
to fill out a form every day by 
midnight to receive food the next 
day. 

If 
students 
arrive 
at 

Northwood past 12:30 p.m.,they 
can submit a form for a late 
afternoon delivery that goes 
until 4 p.m., according to the 
meal request form. It is unclear 
whether students arriving at 
Northwood after 4 p.m. can 
submit a meal request for that 
night. 

“Please complete the form 

daily by Midnight the night 
before if you wish to have food 
delivered for the next day,” the 
form reads.

Sullivan said when she arrived 

at Northwood apartments at 7:45 
p.m., she was given a bag of chips 
for dinner. 

Broekhuizen said Michigan 

Dining is currently working 
to streamline the system so 
students are able to order food 
up to 8 p.m. for doorstep delivery 
that evening.

Whether 
or 
not 
students 

without a meal plan are charged 
for University meal delivery 
while in quarantine housing 
was another source of confusion. 
According to the meal request 
form, if students request meals 
and do not have a meal plan, they 
will be billed $20 per day for each 
day they request food delivery. 
They are responsible for paying 
the charge “in a timely fashion.” 

However, 
the 
email 
from 

Aiken says the Office of the Dean 
of Students covers this charge, 
adding that those with a meal 
plan will see the charge for three 
meals per day deducted from their 
account. 

Initially, students were not 

provided microwaves. Students 
told The Daily that the food was 
delivered in plastic, so they were 
not able to heat it in the oven or 
on the stove if they did not have 
cooking supplies.

In an email to students, faculty 

and staff on Friday, Schlissel noted 
some of the students’ complaints 
about quarantine conditions.

“(The 
University 
is) 
also 

addressing 
concerns 
about 

the quarantine and isolation 
housing 
we’re 
providing 
to 

students,” Schlissel wrote. “Our 
commitment to providing meal 
delivery 
is 
continuing, 
and 

Student Life staff check in with 
each student daily. From now on 
in response to feedback, we will 
be providing microwaves, and all 
Michigan Dining meals will come 
in microwavable packaging.”

As of Sunday, Bickel said he has 

not received his microwave. After 
calling DPSS Saturday evening, he 
was told he would not receive one 
until next week. 

“The food situation here is 

abysmal,” Bickel said. “We have 
been told we will be receiving 
microwaves, but I have not 
received mine yet. The food that 
they provide is low-grade and 
cold. Nothing like what we paid 
for in the dining halls. I have not 
brought myself to eat any of it. 
Most food deliveries occur close 
to noon, so there really is not a 
chance for breakfast. The vast 
majority of my meals have been 
through DoorDash.” 

Students 
unsatisfied 
with 

the meal plan can order food 
from online delivery services 
or local businesses. However, 
Burnstein said he worried local 
workers could be put at risk 
when delivering food, noting 
there are no signs indicating 
that the Northwood housing is 
filled with COVID-19 positive 
residents. The Daily confirmed 
the lack of signage.

“You’ll 
regularly 
see, 

especially at meal times, just 
random delivery drivers walking 
around the apartment, because 
there’s no clear cut protocols 
like where to drop off food or 
interact with your driver, and 
it just puts the drivers at risk,” 
Burnstein said. 

Schlissel 
did 
not 
address 

safety 
precautions 
for 
meal 

delivery in his email. According 
to 
the 
meal 
request 
form, 

University-provided meals are 

delivered 
by 
a 
“University-

appointed contractor.” 

Smith said she was concerned 

about the potential spread of the 
virus at Northwood.

“The man who came and 

delivered our meals, first of 
all, he wasn’t wearing a mask,” 
Smith said. “He opened the 
screen door and put the food 
behind the screen door, which 
made me a little uncomfortable 
because the person in the 
apartment across from me … 
actually had COVID and had a 
fever.”

When asked what precautions 

are in place so Unive rsity staff 
members coming in contact with 
students do not spread the virus, 
Broekhuizen declined to offer 
details but clarified that meals 
are delivered to the students’ 
doorsteps and DPSS officers 
wear appropriate PPE. 

Protocol uncertainty
If 
students 
living 
off-

campus need to quarantine 
or 
isolate, 
the 
Washtenaw 

County 
Health 
Department, 

in 
coordination 
with 
the 

University’s 
Environmental, 

Health and Safety Department, 
will determine if their living 
situation is fit to safely do so. 
If it is not, off-campus students 
may need to move to University-
provided quarantine housing 
or return to their permanent 
residence as well. 

University 
Health 
Service 

tracks 
positive 
COVID-19 

results. Students who are not 
tested at UHS can submit a form 
to notify the University they 
tested positive for the virus. 

Washtenaw County is also 

filtering 
test 
results 
in 
an 

attempt to identify students who 
test positive. Students who are 
known to have tested positive 
will be contacted by a contact 
tracer and asked for the names 
of those with whom they have 
had close personal contact. 

Sullivan 
had 
symptoms 

of COVID-19 and stayed at 
Northwood for one night until 
her test came back negative. 
UHS then authorized her to 
leave. Other students, including 
Bickel, 
were 
instructed 
to 

continue quarantining for 10 to 
14 days, even if their test results 
were negative. 

According to Burnstein, the 

University is keeping students in 
the same complexes who tested 
positive for the virus and those 
who tested negative but both 
must continue quarantining.

“Basically there’s … four or 

five of these apartment clusters, 
and in each of these cluster 
apartments there’s students who 
are exposed but are negative or 
students who are just straight-
up positive, and they’ve just been 
mixing these students together,” 
Burnstein said. 

The 
Daily 
interviewed 

students who tested positive 
and those who tested negative, 
both after being in contact with 
COVID-19 positive individuals 
and after developing symptoms 
similar to COVID-19. All these 
individuals were being housed 
in Northwood apartments. 

In her email to The Daily, 

Broekhuizen elaborated on how 
the Northwood apartments are 
being used for quarantine and 
isolation.

“There 
are 
five 
different 

neighborhoods in Northwood 
Community 
Apartments,” 

Broekhuizen 
wrote. 
“Units 

in Northwood I-III are used 
for isolation and quarantine 
housing. 
These 
are 
private 

apartments with no forced air 
system connecting them to other 
units.”

Broekhuizen also clarified 

that “students are free to leave 
their rooms, but should not 
access 
communal 
areas, 
in 

accordance with public health 
guidelines.” 

Burnstein’s roommate tested 

positive and reported his case to 
the University, listing Burnstein 
as someone with whom he had 
close personal contact. Soon 
after, Burnstein tested positive 
and 
has 
been 
isolating 
at 

Northwood since. 

Burnstein 
said 
the 

University’s 
procedure 
for 

reporting positive COVID-19 
cases is not well-defined. 

“There 
was 
no 
clear-cut 

protocol for how to report this 
stuff,” Burnstein said. “It was 
very unclear … If he hadn’t 
reported it, I don’t know how 
they would have found out.”

QUARANTINE
From Page 2

RAs have also requested 

additional personal protective 
equipment for move-in duties, 
mailroom services and other 
tasks 
requiring 
in-person 

contact. 

On Aug. 23, more than 80 

resident 
advisers 
drafted 

an open letter to University 
Housing, 
asking 
for 
more 

resources to protect against 
COVID-19. They said University 
Housing was not responsive to 
their demands, and they felt 
scared for their safety. More 
than 750 people signed their 
open letter expressing support 
for the RAs’ demands.

After the letter was sent, 

University Housing scheduled 
two town halls with the RAs 
in an effort to strengthen 
communication. 
During 
the 

first town hall, many RAs 
asked University Housing to 
address each of their concerns 
in the open letter through a line-
by-line 
response. 
University 

Housing complied and sent 
an edited version of the letter, 
which was reviewed by The 
Daily, addressing each of their 
demands on Aug. 27. In addition, 
Housing said they had ordered 
face shields and each ResStaff 
member would also receive an 
additional COVID-19 safety kit. 

Despite the order for more 

personal protective equipment, 
some RAs told The Daily they do 
not feel well-equipped to handle 
their other tasks. Noah said one of 
the reasons he quit was because 
of a modification to Community 
Center responsibilities. The CC 
is a lobby-like area generally 
situated in a high-traffic location 
in a dorm where residents can 
ask ResStaff members questions. 

Previously, each staff member 

only had to work in their 
residence hall’s CC. But now, 
ResStaff members might be 
required to work in CCs outside 
of their residence hall. Noah 
argued this new requirement 
was unsafe.

Additionally, Noah said he 

didn’t feel comfortable enforcing 
social 
distancing 
policies, 

since they could jeopardize 
his 
health. 
The 
University 

requires residents to maintain 
health 
precautions 
outlined 

in Community Living at the 
University at Michigan (CLAM), 
the handbook all students living 
in residence halls must abide by.

“I didn’t feel safe being the 

person to break up a dorm party 
in the middle of the pandemic,” 
Noah said. “I think putting 
that responsibility on other 
students, especially students 
who are dependent on their jobs 
for housing, is just not a good 
solution.”

In response to the pandemic, 

the guest policy in dorms has 
been updated. An Aug. 26 

email from University Housing 
leadership obtained by The 
Daily states that outside guests, 
or people living outside of one’s 
dorm, are not permitted in 
residence halls, but residents 
living in the same dorm are 
allowed to visit each other. 

Once the “no guest policy” 

took effect after residents move 
into their dorms, RAs were 
instructed 
to 
tell 
outsiders 

that they are in violation of the 
CLAM. Emily said it will be 
difficult to differentiate who is 
an outside guest and who lives 
in a different part of the dorm. 

Baghdadchi 
wrote 
in 
an 

email to The Daily that staff 
has a shared responsibility for 
“cultivating a culture of care.” 
He wrote that the hall director 
— the leader of each residential 
building — is responsible for 
holding students to community 
standards. University Housing’s 
conduct office will manage 
students who repeatedly break 
them.

Emily said there is no way 

to enforce the policy. Currently, 
the only repercussion from 
breaking this rule is equivalent 
to violating the CLAM: the case 
is forwarded to Housing Student 
Conduct and Conflict Resolution 
for the staff to review. 

“There’s really no teeth to 

this policy,” Emily said. “Yes, 
on paper it sounds good … but in 
terms of enforcement, as an RA, 
we’re really relying on a bluff.”

Approximately two weeks 

after the town halls, some 
RAs announced plans to strike 
claiming no concrete action 
has been taken. They also 
added new demands including 
hazard pay, a statement of non-
retaliation should they form a 
union, and the inclusion of “real 
consequences” should a student 
break social distancing policies. 

In an email to ResStaff sent 

Wednesday night, Rick Gibson, 
director of Michigan Housing, 
responded to some of the RA’s 
demands. He began the letter by 
acknowledging ResStaff’s need 
for action and thanked ResStaff 
members for their commitment 
to public safety and change.

He listed various efforts 

Housing has made to adapt to 
the RAs complaints, noting 
that under the University’s 
surveillance testing program, 
RAs will receive priority status. 
He said because compensation 
for ResStaff primarily comes in 
the form of room and board, the 
University would not provide 
hazard pay. 

In his email to ResStaff, 

Gibson 
also 
elaborated 
on 

consequences 
for 
residents 

who fail to abide by community 
guidelines, noting that follow up 
measures may include contract 
termination.

“Given 
the 
gravity 
of 

COVID-19, that means contract 
termination may be appropriate 
after 
one 
or 
two 
serious 

violations,” Gibson wrote.

Communication 

Disconnect

The three RAs also expressed 

frustration and discontent with 
the 
lack 
of 
communication 

between Housing and ResStaff. 

Noah said the University did 

not let ResStaff know if they 
would still have a job or housing 
in the fall until he received his 
letter of appointment the first 
week of August. 

“That was really stressful as 

a student who depends on them 
for housing,” Noah said. 

Olivia said she’s often put 

into a difficult situation when 
the first time she hears about 
housing updates is through a 
general email that was also sent 
to residents. It can be difficult to 
guide residents and make them 
feel secure when RAs have the 
same questions, Olivia said.

To 
help 
increase 

communication between RAs 
and Housing, the letter sent 
to University Administration 
asked for the creation of a 
student 
liaison 
elected 
by 

ResStaff members to advocate 
for their concerns and inform 
them of updated plans and 
policies. 

Emily said the liaison will 

help RAs feel more heard. 

“As staff members, we are 

consistently asked to be flexible 
and adaptive to our community 
needs,” Emily said. “However, 
when we ask for changes or 
attempt to voice our concerns 
with policies and how they’re 
being implemented, we are told 
that we should not do that.” 

University Housing has not 

yet addressed the demand for a 
student liaison.

With limited channels to 

voice concerns, both current 
and former RAs said there is a 
disconnect between policy and 
implementation. 

According to alum Deryl 

Long, this disconnect is not 
new. During her time as an RA 
from 2018-19, she said she was 
instructed by leadership to 
call DPSS when mental health 
incidents arose. She said many 
of the RAs who experienced 
mental health crises firmly 
believed engaging the police 
would worsen the situation, 
and RAs are put in difficult 
situations when determining if a 
situation needed the police. 

“If you were the RA on duty 

and this kind of situation was 
unfolding, you had to decide 
whether or not you were going 
to involve the police, which is a 
terrible idea, obviously,” Long 
said. “Or you had to risk your job 
security, housing security and 
food security, to go around the 
procedure and just deal with the 
situation yourself.”

Other 
members 
of 
the 

campus community have taken 
issue with the University’s ties 

to law enforcement. Similar 
to the RAs, The Graduate 
Employees’ Organization, which 
represents more than 2,000 
graduate student instructors 
and 
graduate 
student 
staff 

assistants, announced a strike 
on Monday in protest of the 
University’s reopening plans. 
One of GEO’s demands was 
cutting funding to the Division 
of Public Safety and Security 
and reducing law enforcement’s 
presence on campus. 

Long also recalled the job 

taking a large toll on her and 
other 
RAs’ 
mental 
health, 

especially 
because 
they 

weren’t trained mental health 
professionals but were often put 
in serious situations. 

This 
policy 
has 
been 

confirmed by several current 
RAs and is still active. 

Fear of Retaliation

RAs have told The Daily they 

are concerned about losing their 
jobs for speaking out.

Each ResStaff member has 

to sign a letter of appointment 
saying they must uphold all 
expectations of the role. Failure 
to meet the expectations and 
duties 
outlined 
may 
result 

in dismissal from the role, 
according to the LOA.

The letter contains a non-

disparagement 
clause 
that 

says ResStaff cannot publicly 
criticize any University Housing 
policies. Student staff members 
who disagree with any policies 
are encouraged to ask their 
supervisor questions, but they 
should 
continue 
to 
enforce 

all policies and “show public 
support” for them.

The Daily could not confirm 

if an RA has been fired for 
criticizing 
Housing 
or 
its 

policies, however many RAs 
have said they are fearful of 
breaking their contract. As a 
result, Olivia said many students 
on ResStaff did not want to voice 
their concerns publicly.

“I’ve been really afraid there 

will be consequences for me even 
though … (I just want to) ensure 
we’re actually safe,” Olivia said. 
“The fear of retaliation is on all 
of our minds.”

ResStaff 
requested 
the 

University 
administration 

to write a statement of non-
retaliation, 
as 
one 
of 
the 

demands sent in a letter to 
University Housing on Aug. 23. 
Since they still had not received 
a written statement by the Aug. 
24 town hall held between RAs 
and University leadership, over 
half of the attendees turned 
off their cameras and signed in 
anonymously.

Martino 
Harmon, 
vice 

president 
of 
Student 
Life, 

later sent a written statement 
promising non-retaliation.

Schlissel 
later 
added 
that 

“we don’t want anyone to feel 
threatened simply for wanting to 
go to class.”

“Going to the court was our 

only choice after learning that the 
strike would continue,” Schlissel 
said.

GEO’s strike began last Tuesday 

in response to the University’s 
plans to reopen for the fall 
semester. Some of GEO’s demands 
include the universal right to work 
remotely without documentation, 
more robust testing plans and a 
partial reallocation of funds from 
the Division of Public Safety and 
Security 
to 
community-based 

organizations. 

In a statement Monday, the 

union assured the striking graduate 
students that no individual member 
was at risk because the University 
had filed for an injunction.

“We’re 
disappointed 
that 

President Schlissel has chosen 
to immediately abandon these 
promises in favor of trying to shut 
down our strike by brute force,” 
GEO’s statement reads. “Shame 
on the University of Michigan for 
using their immense resources to 
bully their graduate workers out 
of striking — instead of using those 
same resources to create a safe and 
just campus for all.”

The union’s members voted 

overwhelmingly to reauthorize 
their strike Sunday night, saying 
their demands were not met. 

In 
a 
Sunday 
night 
email 

informing members that the strike 

would continue for another week, 
GEO leadership said the strike had 
made a major impact on campus.

“Last week, we proved to 

University leaders, to the University 
community and to each other that 
GEO is committed to fighting for 
a safe and just community, and we 
are not prepared to stop until we 
get it,” the email read.

The union, which represents 

more than 2,000 graduate student 
instructors and graduate student 
staff assistants, previously voted 
to reject the University’s proposal 
on Wednesday, which gave GSIs 
and GSSAs the ability to cancel 
class if a student did not wear a 
mask and pledged to increase the 
transparency of COVID-19 case 
data but did not address the union’s 
demands regarding policing.

Other University groups have 

echoed GEO’s demands for a 
safer pandemic response — more 
than 
100 
residential 
advisers 

announced a strike on Wednesday, 
arguing that the University did 
not provide adequate COVID-19 
protections. Dining hall employees 
also conducted a “slow down” of 
operations across campus Friday 
after initially planning a walkout. 
The walkout was postponed due 
to fear of retaliation from the 
University. 

The request for an injunction 

isn’t the first time the University 
administration has sought outside 
involvement in the ongoing labor 
dispute. On Tuesday, the first 
day of the strike, the University 
filed an unfair labor practice 
charge against GEO, asking the 
Michigan Employment Relations 
Commission to weigh in on the 

strike. The charge names GEO 
President Sumeet Patwardhan.

In 
an 
email 
sent 
to 
all 

undergraduate 
students 

Wednesday, Provost Susan Collins 
called 
the 
strike 
“disruptive, 

confusing and worrisome,” noting 
that it violates both state law and 
the union’s contract, which was 
ratified in April.

“The strike violates Michigan 

law; in addition, GEO has agreed 
by contract not to take actions 
that interfere with the University’s 
operations, in this case, your 
education,” 
Collins 
wrote 
in 

the 
email. 
“Nonetheless, 
the 

University’s team will continue 
to meet with GEO in good faith to 
resolve remaining issues.”

GEO has repeatedly noted that 

the strike is illegal, including joking 
about it online. In a document 
addressing concerns about the 
work stoppage, GEO described 
possible consequences for graduate 
students who participate in the 
strike.

“If GEO strikes when the 

contract is in force, the organization 
may not be able to collect dues,” 
the document reads. “We would 
also be open to lawsuits and 
could be forced to pay damages. 
If the contract is not in force, the 
likelihood of a lawsuit is lower, but 
UM could still get a court order 
for us to stop striking and if we do 
not obey it, the coordinators of the 
strike (the GEO officers) could be 
placed under arrest. GEO has done 
work stoppages in the past, and the 
university has not retaliated.”

In its statement Monday, GEO 

leadership said they were “not 
surprised” that the University had 

turned to the court system.

“We always knew legal action 

was a possibility, and this was a 
transparent part of our multiple 
member-wide discussions about 
the risks of authorizing a work 
stoppage,” the statement reads. 
“Moreover, this legal move is a clear 
sign that withholding our labor is 
working: The University is feeling 
our power.”

In the video released Monday, 

Schlissel 
said 
the 
University 

administration 
welcomed 
the 

chance to negotiate with the union 
but would not allow the work 
stoppage to continue indefinitely.

“The issues raised are very 

important and we’re committed to 
addressing them, but we can’t do 
it at the expense of our students’ 
education,” Schlissel said. “We 
need our classes to be in session 
while we work out our differences 
together.”

Schlissel and Collins will hold 

a public conversation on Tuesday 
to discuss COVID-19, campus 
planning efforts and the impact of 
the pandemic on members of the 
community. 

“No questions or topics related 

to these issues will be off-limits,” an 
email announcing the event reads. 

The 
conversation 
will 
be 

live-streamed 
here. 
University 

community members can submit 
questions here.

A former University of Michigan 

vice president overturned a 1979 
decision to fire Robert Anderson, 
the late University athletic doctor 
accused of sexual misconduct, 
documents filed in U.S. District 
Court Thursday reveal. 

Thomas 
Easthope, 
former 

vice president of the Division of 
Student Life, said in a deposition 
that he took steps to fire Anderson 
upon learning of these allegations. 
Easthope later changed this claim, 
telling investigators he actually 
gave Anderson the option to resign. 
Easthope recounted his experiences 
working with Anderson, whom he 
described as “authoritarian” and 
“in a position of supreme authority” 
at the University, in a deposition 
held on July 28 and Aug. 4. 

According to the amended class 

action complaint, the University 
received “credible allegations” of 
Anderson’s behavior in 1979 but 
chose to conceal them, allowing 
Anderson to retain his position at 
the University until his retirement 
in 2003. Anderson died in 2008. 

Instead of returning to private 

practice, 
Anderson 
transferred 

from his role as director of health 
services to a position as senior 
physician with health services 
in 1980. His personnel file states 
the reason for this transfer as 
“resuming former position.”

“U of M had and has a duty to 

protect the health and safety of its 
students, and this duty includes 
protecting 
them 
from 
sexual 

assaults by U of M employees, and 
responding properly if a sexual 
assault does occur,” the complaint 
reads. “U of M violated this duty 
by failing to implement and enforce 
appropriate policies and procedures 
to prevent, and properly respond to, 
sexual assaults of its students.”

In his deposition, Easthope 

accused former Athletic Director 
Don Canham of ignoring the 
allegations and allowing Anderson 
to take on a more formal and 
increasingly 
influential 
role 

within the University Athletic 
Department. Canham served as 
athletic director from 1968 to 1988 
and is now deceased. 

“U of M, through its most senior 

administrators, employed a false 
artifice 
and 
misrepresentation 

that Anderson was an ethical 
and 
competent 
doctor,” 
the 

complaint says. “In that regard, U 
of M continued to hold Anderson 
out as a leader in its healthcare 
community.”

In March, the University hired 

the law firm WilmerHale to 
investigate the sexual misconduct 
allegations 
against 
Anderson 

after initially hiring Steptoe and 
Johnson LLP. WilmerHale is also 
the firm that released the 88-page 
report detailing its investigation 
into sexual misconduct by former 

Provost Martin Philbert, who 
was removed from his position in 
March.

University 
spokesman 
Rick 

Fitzgerald declined to comment 
on Easthope’s deposition due to 
the ongoing investigation into 
Anderson’s behavior.

“We don’t have anything to add, 

while the WilmerHale investigation 
remains active,” Fitzgerald wrote.

In June, the University began 

reaching out to more than 300,000 
former students who attended 
the University between the 1960s 
and early 2000s, asking them to 
report any interaction they may 
have had with Anderson. In a 
letter to the University community, 
Schlissel stressed the importance of 
protecting students’ privacy during 
the investigation. 

“Safeguarding 
the 

confidentiality of Dr. Anderson’s 
former patients is of paramount 
importance,” 
Schlissel 
wrote. 

“Accordingly, 
WilmerHale 
will 

not disclose any identifying or 
confidential patient information to 
the University, and the identity and 
confidentiality of Dr. Anderson’s 
patients will be protected from 
disclosure to others to the fullest 
extent permitted by law.”

University 
lawyers 

representing 
alleged 
victims 

of Anderson are preparing to 
speak at mediation next week, 
according to the Detroit News.

Because 
students 
with 

underlying 
conditions 
are 

more vulnerable to COVID-
19, they face new challenges 
while returning to campus this 
fall. About 70% of classes are 
being held entirely online, but 
some still require in-person 
attendance, which can force 
these 
students 
to 
decide 

whether to risk their health or 
their degree.

Kinesiology senior Akshay 

Luthra experienced a medical 
emergency when he was 15 
and has since experienced a 
weakening of his lungs and 
developed gastroparesis, among 
other issues. He said these 
conditions weaken his immune 
system and put him at risk not 
only for being more susceptible 
to COVID-19, but also make him 
more likely to experience life-
threatening consequences if he 
does contract it.

Luthra said though returning 

to campus may place him in 
danger, he felt the benefits of 
being back in Ann Arbor for his 
mental health were substantial 
enough to outweigh the risk.

“It had to do a lot with mental 

health, actually,” Luthra said. 
“(At home, in) the case of 
being high risk, it was a lot of 
just barricading myself in the 
house, and I definitely had a lot 
of low days this summer. I just 
needed to see and interact with 
new people, and so I was just 
like, ‘I’ll still be safe; I’ll still be 
in my apartment; I’ll be wearing 
a mask all the time when I walk 
outside, but I need to just do 
this for my mental health.’”

Luthra’s 
struggles 
with 

mental 
health 
during 
the 

pandemic were shared by many 
of his peers, and now that 
many students have returned 
to campus, social gatherings 
of unmasked students in large 
groups have begun popping up. 
Luthra said he relies on other 
students for his safety, and he 
wishes all of them abided by 
social distancing mandates.

“It’s easy to tell that people 

don’t care as much as they 
should,” Luthra said. “They 
think that they’re the safest age 
and don’t need to worry about 
it. (They think that) even if they 
get it, they’ll get over it, but the 
point of masks isn’t to save you, 

it’s to save people like me and 
people that are at a higher risk. 
It’s very selfish.”

Cheyanne 
Killin, 
LSA 

senior 
and 
the 
2019-2020 

Undergraduate Chair of the 
Services 
for 
Students 
with 

Disabilities student advisory 
board, said she chose not to 
return to campus due to pre-
existing conditions.

“The University has not only 

put the lives of chronically 
ill and high-risk students in 
jeopardy, but also reinforced the 
ableist notion that my life and 
my presence at this University 
do not matter,” Killin said. 
“I should not need to choose 
between not graduating with 
my degree and losing my life, or 
at best what’s remaining of my 
health.”

Killin said her friends are 

concerned for their health, 
even going as far as considering 
writing wills. 

“I have a couple of friends 

who are considering writing 
their 
wills 
because 
they’re 

either 
one 
semester 
away 

from graduation, or they have 
scholarship requirements that 
they can’t get out of. Everybody 
is kind of scrambling and afraid, 
and not being supported in any 
way,” Killin said.

University 
spokeswoman 

Kim 
Broekhuizen 
told 
The 

Daily that a good resource 
for 
students 
with 
medical 

conditions 
is 
the 
Campus 

Blueprint website. She also said 
these students should reach 
out to a few campus offices for 
more help.

“Students with disabilities 

and/or 
chronic 
health 

conditions —including those 
who are at increased risk for 
severe illness from COVID-19—
are encouraged to contact their 
professor/instructor, the Dean 
of Students Office (DOS), and/
or Services for Students with 
Disabilities (SSD) to explore 
educational arrangements or 
accommodations for in-person 
courses,” Broekhuizen wrote.

But Killin said she believes 

administration has not done 
enough to protect medically 
vulnerable students.

“The 
Administration’s 

silence is not only deafening 
but murderous, now that this 
incomplete plan has been put 
into action,” Killin said.

LSA senior Lauren Payne, 

who has a thyroid condition that 
causes her to have weakened 
immunity to the virus, echoed 
Luthra’s sentiments regarding 
social gatherings on campus.

“It’s 
really 
frustrating,” 

Payne said, “It doesn’t really 
feel like (my peers care about 
me) because people are being 
irresponsible and pretending 
it’s a personal health choice 
when it’s really a public health 
choice.”

Payne said there is ableism 

at play when students gather 
in large settings and how their 
acts further enable the virus to 
spread.

“They’re 
putting 
people 

at risk because they’ve lived 
most of their lives in positions 
of privilege and are healthy,” 
Payne said. “It’s never going 
to get better if we don’t get 
ourselves under control.”

Payne said she can’t utilize 

learning 
as 
well 
as 
other 

medically vulnerable students 
might because as a senior, 
she is mainly enrolled in labs, 
which require in-person work. 
Though Payne recognizes that 
her professor is supposed to 
comply with medical requests 
of online learning, she worries 
she won’t gain enough from 
that experience.

“I think that if I really 

wanted to get in touch with my 
professors, I could find ways to 
not go to the labs, but it would 
be pretty detrimental to my 
learning of the material,” Payne 
said.

Luckily, Payne is in the 

Program in the Environment 
and her classes take place in 
large outdoor spaces which 
allow her to remain more than 
six feet away from anyone 
else. Payne’s roommate, LSA 
senior Theodora Reynolds, is 
also a student in PitE and was 
supposed to have an in-person 
tutorial with her professor for a 
class she was taking.

Reynolds 
immediately 

expressed her concern with 
meeting 
in 
person 
due 
to 

Payne’s health risk. Reynolds 
said she assumed it would 
be an easy switch to attend 
their meetings via Zoom. Her 
professor, however, did not 
agree.

The University of Michigan 

is asking the state to intervene 
in graduate students’ ongoing 
strike in protest of the school’s 
reopening plans.

In an unfair labor practice 

charge filed with the Michigan 
Employment 
Relations 

Commission on Tuesday — 
the first day members of the 
Graduate 
Employees’ 
Union 

took to the picket line — the 
University requests that the 
commission order GEO to “cease 
and desist from unlawfully 
striking or conducting a work 
stoppage.” 

Lawyers for the University 

also 
urge 
the 
commission 

to 
require 
GEO 
to 
stop 

“repudiating” 
the 
union’s 

collective bargaining agreement 
and refrain from “violating its 
duty to bargain collectively” 
by 
demanding 
negotiations 

on “mandatory and/or illegal 
subjects of bargaining over the 
University’s objections.”

The filing is signed by Gloria 

Hage, the University’s senior 
associate general counsel, and 
Craig S. Schwartz of Butzel 
Long, a law firm with offices 
across Michigan as well as in 
Washington, D.C. and New 
York City. It names Sumeet 
Patwardhan, president of GEO, 
the union that represents more 
than 2,000 graduate student 
instructors 
and 
graduate 

student staff assistants.

The charge highlights that it 

is illegal for public employees to 
strike in the state of Michigan. 
GEO’s 
contract 
with 
the 

University, which was ratified 
in April, also prohibits members 
from participating in a work 
stoppage. 

In a Sunday night email 

regarding the strike, Provost 
Susan Collins described the 
work stoppage as unnecessary 
and unlawful.

“We do not believe it is 

necessary for GEO to strike,” 
Collins wrote. “We successfully 
reached an agreement with GEO 
in April on its entire collective 
bargaining agreement. GEO’s 
strike falls outside of that 
negotiation and is based on a 
number of issues, some of which 
have very little to do with the 
wages, hours, and working 
conditions of GSIs and GSSAs. 
A strike is not appropriate, as 
the primary impact will be on 
our students, particularly our 
undergraduate students.”

In 
a 
message 
to 

undergraduates 
sent 

Wednesday, Collins called the 
strike “disruptive, confusing 
and 
worrisome,” 
reiterating 

the illegality of the job action. 
Numerous deans at colleges 
across 
campus 
echoed 

these concerns in their own 
emails to faculty within their 
departments.

The union has been upfront 

about the illegality of the strike, 
even posting about it on Twitter. 
In a statement addressing U-M 
leadership’s opposition to the 
work stoppage, GEO elaborated 
on the risks of retaliation.

“If 
GEO 
strikes 
when 

the contract is in force, the 
organization may not be able 
to collect dues,” the statement 
reads. “We would also be open 
to lawsuits and could be forced 
to pay damages. If the contract 
is not in force, the likelihood of 
a lawsuit is lower, but UM could 
still get a court order for us to 
stop striking and if we do not 
obey it, the coordinators of the 
strike (the GEO officers) could 
be placed under arrest. GEO 
has done work stoppages in the 
past, and the university has not 
retaliated.”

The 
strike 
runs 
until 

Friday, with the potential for 
reauthorization if the University 
does not meet the organization’s 
demands. Despite Patwardhan’s 
support for a proposal from 
the University, GEO members 
rejected a deal on Wednesday 
night, arguing it failed to satisfy 
their platform.

In an email Friday, University 

spokesperson Rick Fitzgerald 
wrote that in “every case,” 
the 
school 
tries 
“to 
meet 

the interests of all employee 
unions through discussion and 
negotiating to an agreement.” 

“Part of the agreement from 

our recent contract negotiations 
with GEO was a promise on the 
union’s part that its members 
would not strike and leave their 
students without instruction,” 
Fitzgerald said. “It was only 
when they went against that 
promise that the university took 
additional action.” 

Fitzgerald added that the 

University “stands ready to 
continue discussions with GEO 
so that all students are able to 
continue their studies without 
further interruption.”

When asked about the next 

steps in the charge against GEO 
filed with MERC, Fitzgerald 
directed questions to the state 
commission.

MERC handles labor disputes 

involving public and private 
sector employees. It also weighs 
in on unfair labor practice cases. 

The chair of the body, Sam 

Bagenstos, is a professor at the 
University of Michigan Law 
School. Bagenstos, who was 
appointed by Gov. Gretchen 
Whitmer in December 2019, did 
not respond immediately to a 
request for comment.

Schwartz, the outside lawyer 

signing onto the charge, has 
experience with labor conflicts 
in higher education.

In 2019, he helped Eastern 

Michigan 
University 
obtain 

the dismissal of unfair labor 
practice charges brought by 
the union representing EMU’s 

tenured 
and 
tenured 
track 

faculty. EMU “prevailed” after 
a hearing in front of MERC over 
four alleged violations of the 
Michigan Public Employment 
Relations Act, according to a 
press release from Butzel Long.

Schwartz 
referred 
The 

Michigan 
Daily’s 
request 

for comment to Fitzgerald. 
In an email, Fitzgerald said 
the University often looks to 
hire outside attorneys with 
experience in relevant matters.

“It’s 
not 
unusual 
at 
all 

for the university to engage 
attorneys outside of the Office 
of the General Counsel to 
handle specific matters within 
their 
areas 
of 
expertise,” 

Fitzgerald wrote. “They work 
in conjunction with attorneys in 
OGC.”

The 
law 
firm 
where 

Schwartz works has also been 
involved in the debate over the 
state’s COVID-19 restrictions. 
Butzel 
Long 
attorneys 

represented several Michigan 
CEOs who sent a letter in mid-
April pushing Gov. Gretchen 
Whitmer to “reopen” the state 
and allow employees to return 
to work. The letter cited data 
indicating 
that 
Michigan’s 

COVID-19 cases had peaked. 
According to The New York 
Times, Michigan’s new daily 
case count peaked in early April, 
at 1,722 new cases on April 7. 

The CEOs noted how hard it 

was to “balance public health 
and the economy,” but argued 
when it comes to deciding 
between saving lives and saving 
jobs, “Michigan has enough 
moxie to do both at the same 
time.”

Whitmer later offered a path 

for reopening certain businesses 
following the firm’s efforts. 

COVID-19 precautions are 

at the heart of the graduate 
students’ strike in Ann Arbor. 
GEO has called to reduce the 
police presence on campus and 
cut the University’s ties to law 
enforcement. 

The 
unfair 
labor 
charge 

takes issue with these demands, 
calling 
the 
aspects 
of 
the 

platform 
related 
to 
police 

reform — such as demilitarizing 
the Division of Public Safety 
and 
Security 
and 
diverting 

funding to the department — 
“non-mandatory and/or illegal 
subjects of bargaining.”

The charge notes that GEO’s 

other demands are relevant 
to graduate students’ work 
conditions, but argues that 
GEO has “declined to seek 
a resolution of such issues 
through the grievance and 
arbitration 
procedures 
of 

the 
collective 
bargaining 

agreement.”

Six months later: what treating COVID-19 looks like

Thursday marks six months since 

the first positive COVID-19 tests 
were detected in Michigan. Since 
then, health care professionals at 
Michigan Medicine adapted to an 
unprecedented public health crisis 
that has tested the strength of the 
hospital’s resources and employees.

During the first three months of 

the pandemic, cases in Michigan 
skyrocketed, reaching a peak of 
around 1,000 cases on March 30. 
Health care workers experienced 
great personal tragedy and loss as 
a result of the pandemic and said 
they made it through thanks to the 
support of colleagues.

For many health care systems 

across 
the 
country, 
the 
last 

six months have also resulted 
in extreme financial losses — 
Michigan Medicine is no exception. 
In May, Marschall Runge, chief 
executive 
officer 
of 
Michigan 

Medicine, announced the hospital 
would begin layoffs and furloughs 
affecting around 1,400 full-time 
employees in order to promote the 

hospital’s economic recovery.

The Daily spoke with five 

physicians from Michigan Medicine 
to discuss progress made in treating 
the disease and the hardships faced 
by health care professionals over the 
past six months. 

‘Nobody 
knew 
just 
how 

contagious this was or how risky it 
was’

According to Robert Dickson, 

assistant professor in the Medical 
School 
who 
specializes 
in 

pulmonary and critical care, nobody 
knew the best way to tackle the 
impending crisis when it first began. 

“A lot of that initial speculation I 

think was driven by uncertainty and 
a lack of experience,” Dickson said. 
“Early on in the COVID crisis we 
just didn’t have data, we didn’t even 
have observational cohorts to tell 
us what we were seeing. So in the 
absence of that, all you have to go on 
is personal experience and expert 
opinion.”

Physicians said the lack of clear 

evidence and tested treatments 
created confusion when attempting 
to help their patients recover from 
COVID-19. Many said they were 

working outside of their areas of 
expertise to treat the disease. 

Hallie Prescott, a pulmonary 

and critical care physician working 
in 
Michigan 
Medicine’s 
main 

Intensive Care Unit and the Ann 
Arbor Veterans Affairs Medical 
Center, said a six-month learning 
curve gradually eased their fears 
about the virus, and gave time for 
doctors to determine effective 
treatments. 

“In the beginning, nobody knew 

just how contagious this was or how 
risky it was to be working in these 
ICUs, so there was a high level of 
fear about people contracting the 
virus and among people working 
outside of their normal scope,” 
Prescott said. “As we learned more, 
we increasingly realized that the 
normal ways that we take care of 
people in terms of life support were 
appropriate.”

Since March, physicians around 

the world have learned about the 
best ways to treat patients with 
COVID-19. 
Various 
treatments 

fell in and out of use, including 
hydroxychloroquine, 
remdesivir 

and most recently, corticosteroids. 

Dickson 
said 
some 
of 
the 

practices he and other critical care 
physicians used six months ago are 
no longer used to combat the virus.

“I think we’re smarter about 

some of the therapies we offer — 
there are some things that we were 
doing back in March and April 
that had no data to support them,” 

Dickson said. “One lesson we’ve 
learned is that nothing competes 
with the standard, evidence-based 
practices.”

‘There’s no precexdent in my or 

anyone else’s experience’

Several health care providers 

expressed pride in their responses to 
the massive demand for care. Robert 

Hyzy, medical director of Michigan 
Medicine’s critical care unit, said 
neither he nor any of his colleagues 
anticipated or even fathomed an 
event like the COVID-19 pandemic.

After four years of negotiations, 

local officials have come to a 
proposed agreement on a cleanup 
plan for the Gelman dioxane plume 
on Aug. 31. 

The plume’s history goes back 

to 1958, when the late Charles 
Gelman 
began 
manufacturing 

micro-porous filters in the local 
Ann Arbor area. A chemical called 
1,4-dioxane was used during the 
process, and eventually seeped into 
soil, polluting groundwater at the 
company’s Scio Township plant.

Over 
decades, 
the 
dioxane 

spread into a large plume of 
underground 
contamination 
in 

northwest Ann Arbor. Dioxane was 
deemed a probable carcinogen and 
has been found to cause kidney and 
liver damage as well as respiratory 
problems.

The newly proposed settlement 

with polluter Gelman Science Inc. 
details a thorough plan for a cleanup 
protocol, which includes expanding 
prohibition zones and increasing 
well installments to monitor the 
plume’s migration through Ann 
Arbor area’s groundwater systems.

The 
settlement’s 
executive 

summary states there will be 
“a significant increase in the 
obligations imposed on Gelman 
to 
investigate 
and 
remediate 

1,4-dioxane contamination at and 
migrating away from the Gelman 
site.”

Prohibition 
zones 
were 

also redefined in the proposed 
settlement. These zones prohibit 
the use of groundwater in particular 
areas due to the heightened levels 
of dioxane. Additionally, the state’s 
dioxane assessment for drinking 
water saw a significant decrease 
from 85 parts per billion to 7.2 
parts per billion. Areas within the 
prohibition zone show levels of 
dioxane greater than 7.2 parts per 
billion.

Ann Arbor City Councilmember 

Ali Ramwali, D-Ward 5, said 
this agreement is the result of 
years of negotiations, going back 
long before he assumed office 
in 2018. Regardless, Ramwali 
acknowledged that this proposal is 
not perfect.

“I think it ultimately is the best 

agreement the intervenors’ and the 
polluters’ attorneys can come up 
to,” Ramwali said. “And ultimately, 
this agreement is the summation 
in the totality of improvements 
that we can make on the current 
situation. Does it satisfy all our 

concerns? No, it does not.”

In 2016, the city officially filed 

a lawsuit against Gelman and has 
been negotiating since then. The 
proposed 
settlement, 
however, 

has drawn criticism from local 
residents who wish to see the 
federal government intervene.

Dan Bicknell, an environmental 

remediation 
professional 
and 

former Environmental Protection 
Agency Superfund enforcement 
officer, discovered the Gelman 
plume when he was completing 
research at the University of 
Michigan in 1984. He is now the 
president of Global Environment 
Alliance LLC and an Ann Arbor 
resident.

“The state government has 

failed us for almost 40 years now 
on this project,” Bicknell said. “And 
the idea that a local government, 
who has no expertise whatsoever, 
can do a better job at compelling 
this very, again, resistant polluter 
to do the right thing is not logical.”

Larry Lemke, a hydrogeologist 

and professor at Central Michigan 
University, was hired as an expert 
for the Ann Arbor, Scio Township, 
Washtenaw County and Huron 
River Watershed Council’s lawsuit 
against Gelman. In a series of 
videos, Lemke gave a thorough 
rundown of the proposal, saying 
that the contamination will likely 
remain in the groundwater system 
in the future.

“Although concentrations have 

decreased over time, we can expect 
dioxane to stay in the groundwater 
and continue to spread for many 
years to come,” Lemke said.

Ramwali clarified that cleanup 

of the plume will never result in 
completely pristine water levels, 
regardless of who is in charge of it.

“The way that the dioxane in 

the natural world, the complexities 
of 
our 
underground 
aquifer 

system, the geology and again, 
the way the dioxane behaves in 
these conditions, we will never 
get to pristine levels ever in our 
lifetime,” Ramlawi said. “It’s just 
scientifically, 
technologically 

impossible at this point in history 
to get those underground aquifers 
back to pristine levels.”

Bicknell said the community 

is not asking for pristine water 
levels, but rather reverting the 
groundwater to drinking water 
state. He also noted that a Gelman 
feasibility study found that it was 
not an impossible feat.

Chants from picket lines echo 

from campus building to campus 
building. But step off campus — 
where most students are tuning 
into remote classes — and that 
echo quickly fades.

Graduate 
students 
at 
the 

University of Michigan are on 
strike, demanding more stringent 
COVID-19 precautions in the 
fall semester reopening plan and 
reforms in policing on campus. 
Many 
of 
those 
striking 
are 

Graduate Student Instructors who 
lead and assist with undergraduate 
classes. 

The 
Graduate 
Employees’ 

Organization, 
the 
union 

representing 
graduate 
student 

instructors and graduate student 
staff 
assistants, 
has 
asked 

undergraduate students to observe 
the picket line in solidarity with 
the strike, meaning they should 
not attend class. Central Student 
Government 
also 
encouraged 

students not to cross the picket 
line in a resolution passed Tuesday 
night.

When LSA sophomore Lindsay 

Adams heard this call-to-action, 
skipping class was a no brainer. 

“I’m fortunate enough that I’m 

in a position where I can do that 
without sabotaging myself,” she 
said. “I think this is a really, really 
important cause so I’m planning 

on standing behind the strike 
members.”

Some 
students 
who 
aren’t 

strongly opinionated about the 
strike, such as LSA sophomore 
Lorenzo 
Luna, 
were 
left 
to 

decide whether or not to stand 
in solidarity with the GSIs by 
skipping classes.

“I feel like I don’t really have 

a place in (the strike), because I 
myself am not a GSI,” Luna said. 
“Me skipping class won’t really 
do much to give the GSIs more 
leverage in their negotiations.”

Engineering senior Hannah 

Lowenthal said she’d be willing to 
skip class, but only if her classes’ 
GSIs ask her to do so.

“If my GSI expressed to me that, 

‘I am part of this movement and I 
don’t feel comfortable attending 
classes,’ 
I 
would 
be 
totally 

supportive of that,” Lowenthal 
said. “I would go with whatever he 
wants.”

Students who have decided to 

join the strike must navigate a 
question few have faced before: 
Where does the picket line stop 
when classes are taught online? 

LSA 
sophomore 
Renee 

Boudreau said it would be harder 
for students to ignore the strike if 
classes were in-person.

“The lines are really blurred 

with everything being online,” she 
said. “If you were to be going into 
class, you wouldn’t want to cross 
the picket line.” 

LSA junior Alyssa Thomas is 

an active supporter of the GEO. 
She attended the union’s die-in 
protest of the University’s fall 
reopening protocols, boycotted 
her synchronous classes this week 
in solidarity with the strike and 
expressed support for Residential 
Staff — of which she is a member 
—voting to strike alongside GEO 
as well. 

Thomas 
said 
attending 

asynchronous 
lectures 
and 

completing assigned class material 
does not take away from the strike. 

“Because I don’t have an 

attendance responsibility, it would 
be pointless for me to not go to 
those asynchronous lectures,” she 
said. “If we are to get a University 
response by the end of the week, 
I would still be responsible for 
obtaining all the information. It’s 
basically a matter of ‘do I want 
to do it now, or do I want to do it 
later?’”

LSA junior Andie Gardiner 

decided to do her asynchronous 
classes and homework outside of 
the GEO’s official picket hours.

“Even if it’s asynchronous and 

the lectures are pre-recorded, I 
would like to just show my support 
by doing that outside of when the 
strike line is visible,” Gardiner 
said.

 Lowenthal said she’d be more 

likely to boycott if her classes 
weren’t online. 

“There is some discomfort 

walking solo past a big crowd of 
people protesting for something,” 
she said. “At that point, I probably 
wouldn’t go to class.”

GEO Secretary Amir Fleishman 

said undergraduate support is a 
vital component of this strike’s 
success. He said undergraduates 
have attended picketing events 
and spoken at GEO events.

“Undergraduate 
support 
is 

so, so important for us because 
we’re out there for everybody,” 
Fleishman 
said. 
“Inadequate 

testing impacts undergrads too. It 
impacts the entire community far 
beyond this campus. So we really 
love to see undergrads come out in 
support of us.”

Some students who said they 

were initially unaware of the 
significance of crossing a picket 
line eventually decided to skip 
classes in solidarity.

Boudreau attended classes on 

the first day of the strike. It wasn’t 
until Tuesday evening that she 
decided to boycott her classes for 
the remainder of the week.

“I think it was questioning my 

privilege,” Boudreau said. “I kind 
of just had to consider that my 
performance in class is very, very 
much less important than other 
people’s safety in their lives as they 
interact with people on campus.”

Navigating the return to every-

day life for formerly incarcerated 
individuals is no small feat. Youth 
Justice Fund (YJF), a non-profit 
based in Ypsilanti MI, works 
to assist formerly incarcerated 
youth reacclimating to society. 
Executive Director Aaron Kinzel, 
who spent 10 years in the prison 
system, aims to provide mental 
and financial support to get for-
merly incarcerated individuals 
back on their feet. 

YJF’s 
website 
thoroughly 

explains the mission, stressing 
healing, reconnection and educa-
tion as core values and ultimate 
goals for each client and the non-
profit at large. Within these val-
ues, there exists a commitment 
to securing housing, employment 
and transportation. Financially, 
YJF aims to assist clients with 
paying their rent, DTE or water 
bills, as well as provide them with 
food. For those with small chil-
dren, YJF looks to provide dia-
pers, formula or other necessities. 

Last year, founder Deborah 

Labelle led a retreat in Dexter, 
Michigan for the Incarcerated 
Children 
Advocacy 
Network, 

ICAN, and YJF clients. YJF cli-
ents 
participated 
in 
outdoor 

activities, such as fishing and 
swimming 
— 
activities 
they 

couldn’t experience as youth in 
the criminal justice system. Not 
only were there recreational 

activities, but the retreat also 
focused on trauma therapy and 
discussing mental health to pro-
vide YJF clients with support, a 
sense of community and under-
standing among each other. YJF 
is currently seeking $5,000 to 
lead another retreat this year.

The stigma surrounding peo-

ple with a criminal past in tan-
dem with the pandemic has led to 
a rapid decrease in available jobs 
and has made finding employ-
ment even more difficult for YJF 
clients and returning citizens 
everywhere. These challenges 
have made YJF’s efforts to help 
clients apply for unemployment 
insurance among other govern-
ment benefits within the past few 
months even more influential.

Struggling to reintegrate 
Pat Bates, a member of YJF 

who met Kinzel at a panel a week 
out of prison, reflected on his 
own 
experience 
transitioning 

back home and the support he 
received from YJF. 

“What I didn’t want to do was 

come home and be selling drugs 
or committing crimes or any-
thing like that, but I also didn’t 
want to be somebody’s slave,” 
Bates said. “With Aaron and the 
Youth Justice Fund they found 
me opportunities. The biggest 
resource that I’ve had since I’ve 
been home is the Youth Justice 
Fund.”

Since Bates’s return home, YJF 

has provided him immense aid, 
including a car that has made his 
career pursuits more feasible. 
Additionally, Kinzel has pushed 
Bates to pursue higher education 
beyond the Associates degree he 
earned prior to his incarceration. 

“[Bates] had an associates 

degree while he was in the sys-
tem, but I’m going to make sure 
I push Bates further because 
he’s a smart individual,” Kinzel 
said. “When he comes to a bump 
in the road I can say, ‘Bates, you 

know what, steer a little left, this 
is what I did.’ And if he needs 
resources I can connect him with 
people, give him a little financial, 
whatever he needs to make sure 
that he keeps climbing that hill.”

Bates explained that without 

support and resources, many 
returning citizens resort to com-
mitting crime for the sake of sur-
vival. Kinzel admitted that, upon 
his return, he considered robbing 
people while struggling to accli-
mate to society. 

“The one thing about people 

who come home (from prison) 
is that we are very proud, but 
that pride can get us into trou-
ble because we don’t have these 
resources 
or 
opportunities,” 

Bates said. “So we might go take 
another pass, so to speak.” 

Kinzel elaborated, emphasiz-

ing that in many communities 
with high rates of crime and pov-
erty, there are few to no resources 
to help former inmates get back 
on their feet. 

“We know these communities, 

we know what it’s like living in 
poverty, living in crime-ridden 
areas without opportunities or 
resources,” Kinzel said. “Coming 
home now all these years later, it’s 
been like a new prison experience 
in a weird way. When you go into 
prison you have to learn this new 
environment, you have to adapt. 
But then when you come home it’s 
almost like the same thing….You 
have to build a reputation, you 
have to make connections and 
network and (find) people who 
are on your team.”

This “new prison” experience 

that Kinzel described comes from 
an intense societal stigma against 
formerly 
incarcerated 
indi-

viduals. Kinzel highlighted the 
stark variation in mental health 
resources based on a communi-
ty’s affluence. In most privileged 
environments, Kinzel suggested 
that emotional support is far 

more accessible.

“A 16-year-old kid kills them-

selves in a privileged communi-
ty,” Kinzel said. “There’s all types 
of trauma counseling and therapy 
for them in high school. But an 
eight-year-old kid in the city of 
Detroit sees death and murder 
all the time and they get a teddy 
bear and maybe a t-shirt and bal-
loons.”

The essence behind Kinzel’s 

example is clear: Socioeconom-
ic divisions play a major role 
in access to healthcare and, by 
extension, strongly shape the way 
children learn to cope with trau-
ma and violence in adulthood. 

“We’re broken little boys in 

really tough communities and 
then we have to become hard-
ened, aggressive, hyper mascu-
line teenagers, to prove ourselves 
in a community where we had to 
survive,” he said.

Therein lies a central prob-

lem — a societal ignorance 
about where formerly incarcer-
ated individuals like Bates and 
Kinzel “come from.” This lack of 
understanding produces a sense 
of indifference toward civilians 
coming out of the criminal justice 
system and disregards the trau-
matic circumstances that might 
have led them into the system in 
the first place. 

The gap between socially con-

scious and unconscious individu-
als in regard to the prison system 
and larger American systems 
remains drastic. This persistent 
ignorance perpetuates a stigma 
that formerly incarcerated indi-
viduals are unworthy or lesser 
members of society, presenting a 
significant barrier for them when 
finding sustainable employment 
opportunities. 

Professional pursuits
The pervasive stigmas encoun-

tered by returning citizens are 
not only unfair, but also untrue. 
Incarcerated individuals often 

hold leadership positions during 
their sentences — which enforce a 
large variety of clerical and criti-
cal skills — but employers don’t 
value these experiences when 
they’re compared to applicants 
with a more traditional work 
background. 

“Just think about a guy in pris-

on who’s the man of the yard,” 
Bates said. “You might have one 
guy that was a law clerk, a parale-
gal in a law library, you got anoth-
er guy and he’s a 4.0 student in 
Jackson college, the only college 
they offer, and you might have 
another guy who was in the rec-
reation department and he was 
coordinating all types of events 
and activities, huge things that 
people out here get paid really 
good to do. That’s what I was. I 
was the rec official, I organized 
events and everything. But then 
you come out here and you’re just 
a piece of shit. You’re nothing. 
You were important in prison —
just think about the culture shock 
in that alone.” 

Without any structure in place 

to aid the return of formerly 
incarcerated 
citizens, 
Kinzel 

emphasized 
how 
important 

participation 
from 
businesses 

around Ann Arbor is. Employ-
ers like Phillis Engelbert, owner 
of the Lunchroom LLC and the 
Detroit Street Filling Station, 
have become a key resource for 
rehabilitative pursuits. Though 
small businesses should not be 
the backbone of these community 
efforts, their contributions can 
be incredibly impactful. Engel-
bert speaks openly of her pas-
sion for criminal justice reform 
through helping individuals with 
employment, accountability and 
rehabilitative spaces, and patrons 
of both her restaurants know the 
importance behind these prin-
ciples. 

“Phyllis is a prime example 

with The Lunchroom,” Kinzel 
said. “Maybe some of you have 
connections or family that might 
own a business — if they’re will-
ing to hire someone that’s been 
in the system, that’s a huge help. 
Or just taking donations at busi-
nesses too is another way. Or 
volunteers, interns, to just kinda 
get the word out that this is some-
thing that we need to build as a 
community.”

Engelbert has found incredible 

success in doing just that and her 
businesses are both financially 
stable and creating rehabilitative 
communities. 

“(My 
employees) 
are 
the 

brightest bright spot. Our crew 
is upbeat, professional, respon-
sible, caring and accountable to 
the business and each other. They 
are a pleasure to be around. It is 
because of their hard work that 
our business is succeeding,” she 
wrote in the Detroit Street Dis-
Batesch.

“I don’t want handouts for my 

clients,” Kinzel said. “But I want 
them to get a helping hand and 
that first step so they can become 
productive citizens and people 
that are community members.” 

Of course, money is what pays 

the bills, and returning citi-
zens often come away from the 
prison system with very little. 
But a network of volunteer posi-
tions, internships and connec-
tions make one person’s efforts, 
like Phyllis’, more sustainable in 
the pursuit toward community 
enrichment.

Performative activism
Both Kinzel and Bates empha-

sized the toxicity of performative 
activism, imploring University 
students, white allies and those 
from wealthy, Eurocentric-based 
backgrounds to invest in their 
communities and engage in on-
the-ground, tangible support in 
order to catalyze justice reform. 

“I think what a lot of people 

who come from privileged areas 
think is that they’re gonna come 
in and save the day,” Kinzel said. 
“You know, they throw a little 
money sometimes in the sys-
tem or they volunteer, and then 
they’re good. That’s not what’s 
gonna change society. We need 
people that are from privileged 
communities, we need all races, 
all 
ethnicities, 
all 
religions, 

everybody. We all need to work 
together to fight oppression.”

Kinzel emphasized the impor-

tance of letting those who have 
been oppressed guide our com-
munities in the right direc-
tion. He referred to a tendency 
amongst privileged individuals 
to participate in protest for the 
sake of performative signage and 
social media posts, only to return 

to the comfort of their homes an 
hour later, feeling as though they 
have changed the world. He pro-
posed more productive alterna-
tives, like engaging in mentorship 
programs, advocating for policy 
reform, 
challenging 
personal 

biases and prejudices and sup-
porting previously incarcerated 
individuals in their career search. 

“We need people that are 

gonna treat us like human beings, 
we need people that can be men-
tors. College students need to 
reach out to some of my partici-
pants and help them get navi-
gated.”

For college students looking to 

help returning citizens, Kinzel is 
constantly looking for mentors 
and tutors for his participants 
that are starting their higher 
education or working in the Ann 
Arbor or Detroit area. 

“But the thing is you have to 

actually come and be a part of 
these communities,” Bates said. 
“Come and dig in the trenches 
with us, get your hands dirty. I’d 
like to see more actual work than 
crying and shouting.”

dents or any residents in the Ann 
Arbor area can volunteer with

Systems and cyclic oppression
Questions about prison reform 

and policing –– such as commu-
nity policing, police budgets and 
the prison industrial complex and 
their relationship to civilian soci-
eties –– have been at the forefront 
of many American minds follow-
ing an outburst of civil rights 
activism in recent months. Bates 
and Kinzel’s stories illuminate the 
urgency of disrupting the current 
system.

“(The 
prison 
system) 
was 

designed and is doing exactly what 
it was intended to do — which is to 
marginalize, oppress and control 
certain populations. And these are 
populations that are living in pov-
erty, populations that are predom-
inantly and desperately impacted 
as communities of color, these are 
people that to society, — at least 
the elites in the world and to poli-
ticians — are throw away people.”

Kinzel explained that the cor-

porate entity behind the prison 
system is what makes the opera-
tion so powerful — similar to slav-
ery, incarceration is economically 
“too big to fail.” As Kinzel puts it, 
“It’s the best experiment in United 
States history of business mal-
practice.” 

The University of Michigan is a 

community largely revered for its 
diverse intellect and passion for 
social justice; however, Kinzel dis-
cussed how it often feels as though 
universities exploit these commu-
nities and individuals for research 
purposes.

“I work part time for the Uni-

versity of Michigan as faculty 
on the Dearborn campus and I 
see it in Dearborn, I see it in Ann 
Arbor,” Kinzel said. “They want to 
do this research, they want to get 
the stories from people like myself 
and Bates, but they don’t invest 
much in us and those communi-
ties. It saddens me and angers me 
simultaneously. It doesn’t mean 
that there aren’t people with good 
intentions in these spaces, but I 
think overall universities very 
often become corporate bureau-
cracies and are just trying to make 
a buck off of us.”

In positions of privilege, such 

as our own — being the University 
student body — we must confront 
and actively work to uplift these 
communities, no matter how dis-
tant they seem from our lives at 
U-M.

Aforementioned 
opportuni-

ties to do so, such as tutoring, and 
serving as a prominent academic 
or professional mentor for these 
returning citizens, is one way to 
pursue helpful contributions. 

Bates and Kinzel remind us 

that we are capable of incredible 
change when we work as a collec-
tive.

“Let’s be real, the people in 

power are more wealthy.....if you 
don’t get wealthy white folks on 
board for justice reform, shit’s 
not gonna happen,” Kinzel said. 
“But we also need Black folks, we 
need Indigenous people, we need 
Latinx people, we need Hispan-
ics, and Arab Americans — every-
body’s gotta be sitting at this 
table. But, when I say we’re hold-
ing hands, it’s gotta be equal. But 
help us, those who have lived the 
oppressed experience, help us lead 
you in the right direction. Because 
we know the answers.”

Wildcat strike. When I first heard 

this term, it seemed something feral, 
yet unavoidable, similar to when you 
mistreat an animal for long enough 
and it finally decides to bite back. As 
a ResStaff member in West Quad, 
I would say that this is an accurate 
portrayal of my own feelings about 
choosing to strike. It feels as if I have 
been knocked down, ignored and 
belittled enough times that finally I 
have reached my breaking point. And 
so, at 9 a.m. this past Wednesday, 
along with the majority of ResStaff 
members, I decided to start striking. 
I will not speak for all of ResStaff, but 
I will share the personal occurrences 
that have driven me to risk my hous-
ing and food security. This week has 
been a thrown-into-the-deep-end 
way of being introduced to labor 
unions. I was not raised in a family 
that instilled the importance of not 
crossing the picket line. While my 
grandfathers were an auto-worker 
and a factory worker, and my grand-
mothers were a seamstress and a 
homemaker, I have received little to 
no education on labor unions up until 
this point. My mother is a University 
administrator at another institution, 
so when I heard of unions it was 
often laced with traces of frustra-
tion. Now, as a laborer participating 
in a strike myself, it feels like a comi-
cal turning of tables. 

While walking picket lines and 

refusing to show up to work shifts 
this past week, I often pondered 
about legendary Detroit activist 

Grace Lee Boggs and how she was 
first introduced to activism through 
labor unions and poor housing con-
ditions. In an NPR piece about her 
life, she describes her introduction to 
activism: “she was forced to find free 
housing in a rat-filled basement… 
One day, as Boggs was walking 
through her neighborhood, she came 
across a group of people protest-
ing poor living conditions — which 
included rat-infested housing.” To 
think, only five years after her death 
in a city she knew and loved, stu-
dent workers are striking over simi-
lar conditions. No demand for safe, 
comfortable living conditions is too 
great, whether it be due to pests or 
a pandemic — or both in the case of 
the Northwood Apartments where 
students are being quarantined. It is 
soothing to know that I walk in the 
steps of an outstanding Asian Ameri-
can woman activist, but it’s heart-
breaking that I must fight the same 
struggles. 

To mention Grace Lee Boggs 

without also recognizing the inter-
sectionality of safe housing and race 
would be a slight. Grace (and I use 
her first name because I feel that she 
would embrace the rejection of typi-
cal status signifiers and would also 
stand with the more radical ways of 
teaching from activist authors like 
Paulo Friere) actively fought against 
the oppressive and racist systems 
of housing in our society for both 
Asian and Black Americans. There 
is an inextricable link between the 
location of communities of color and 
poor living conditions in intention-
ally underfunded neighborhoods. 
Communities of color have been 

historically displaced, segregated 
and denied access to equal wealth-
building opportunities and home 
ownership. This has been carried 
out through redlining (which was 
particularly directed at Black com-
munities) as well as other blatantly 
discriminatory housing guidelines 
that denied people of color a chance 
at upward mobility.

While I would never say that the 

University of Michigan is under-
funded, I would say that it uses some 
of the same predatory practices on 
students with marginalized identi-
ties that housing authorities have 
utilized. Michigan Housing’s hir-
ing process often targets ResStaff 
who would not have another option 
when it comes to paying for room 
and board. Many are dependent 
upon financial aid, and would be 
risking housing and food security if 
they stepped out of line in their posi-
tions. It is this fear mongering that 
has prevented ResStaff from strik-
ing for so long. However, many were 
catalyzed into acting because the 
difference between striking and not 
striking was literally life and death. 
In my experience, striking was less 
a choice and more a duty as a leader 
to residents in my community and 
a colleague to my fellow ResStaff 
members. It was essential that I 
use my voice to advocate for oth-
ers. However, this is a terrifyingly 
vulnerable place to be. It has been 
a privilege that I have never felt the 
same housing insecurity that I am 
feeling now. The constant paralyz-
ing ache of awaiting an email telling 
me to remove myself from Housing 
premises immediately is all-con-

suming. In such a situation, I lean on 
the community around me, but this 
comes with mounting challenges as 
I balance trying to protect those I 
care about. Over the past few weeks 
I have told friends I was radioactive 
— too often exposed to spaces where 
students are blatantly irresponsible 
and potentially contributing to the 
spread of COVID-19. I didn’t want to 
return home to visit my father for his 
68th birthday because I didn’t want 
to expose him to everything I could 
be carrying. I have dodged repeated 
phone calls from my mother because 
I can’t lie to her again and tell her 
that I’m alright while holding back 
tears. This is nothing in comparison 
to ResStaff members who are risk-
ing homelessness in the case that 
the University decides to fire us en 
masse for making our voices heard. 
I can return to my hometown if no 
other housing is available, but not all 
of ResStaff can say the same. This is 
why I strike. For the marginalized 
folks in my community who are 
being taken advantage of by Uni-
versity Housing practices that echo 
the discriminatory rules of another 
era. I strike for future student work-
ers who do not yet know how to 
raise their voices and I strike for 
myself, to give myself an opportu-
nity to demand more. Throughout 
her work, Grace Lee Boggs always 
mentions that revolution and activ-
ist action comes from a place of deep 
love. A love for people and the places 
they live and work. Funnily enough, 
the place where I work is also the 
place I live and like Grace says, I have 
an enormous amount of love for it. 
For this reason, I strike.

Get your sweetheart fully involved

especially about money. It’s the 
respectful thing to do and will 
help you avoid any potential 

pitfalls from the 
Venus-Uranus square. 
Keep talking.

AQUARIUS

GEMENI

The biggest problem you face in a 
relationship this week is your 
belief that you know what your 
partner wants. Do you? Really? 
Have you actually listened, as 

opposed to just hear 
what you want to 
hear? Think deeply 
about this.

SAGITTARIUS

CAPRICORN

SCORPIO

CANCER

Any financial waste or irrespon-
sible monetary decisions this 
week will cause problems within 
a relationship. The New Moon 
boosts your communication 

skills, but you’ll need a 
lot of tact and patience 
to handle this well.

TAURUS

Conflict this week could come 
from your blood family’s reaction 
or attitude towards your lover. 
There may be prejudice or just 
irrational dislike in the mix here – 

but either way, you owe 
it to your partner to 
stand up for him or her.

VIRGO

LIBRA
LEO

Your identity is inextricably 
linked to your career, but is your 
partner fully onboard with that? 
This week’s New Moon 
underlines the need to ensure that 

you share your values 
with one another, and 
that communication 
lines remain open.

Read your weekly horoscopes from astrology.tv

The New Moon in your own sign 
is a very positive event. There’s 
potential magic in romance this 
week too, despite the Venus-Ura-
nus square. Speak to your partner 

from your very soul and 

you’ll awaken a deeper 
desire than ever 
before.

With a New Moon in your privacy 
zone, it’s important to rely on your 
own counsel this week – especially 
as advice from friends could be 
misleading. Their intentions are 

good, but when it comes 

to romance, you should 
definitely trust your 
own instincts.

What you think is good news for 
your relationship may be viewed 
very differently by your partner, 
especially if it involves your career. 
The New Moon encourages you to 

share your dreams and 

plans with your 

sweetheart – get on the 
same page.

The New Moon fires up your 
ambitions zone, so this is a great 
week for seeking a new job or a 
promotion. If you’re single and 
looking for love, don’t be too 

narrow-minded about 

the kind of person 

you’re seeking. Break 
the mold.

This week’s Venus-Uranus square 
is actually a good chance to liven 
up a flagging relationship. Spice 
things up in whatever way you 
choose, but do introduce some 

spontaneity to keep the 

magic alive. Boredom is 

your enemy.

This can be a very healing week 
for your relationship, especially if 
in-laws or others have previously 
tried to interfere in your 
togetherness. The New Moon 

highlights a fresh bond of 

trust between you, 
which you can 
definitely build upon.

The New Moon is in your love 
zone, but the Venus-Uranus 
square suggests that you’ll simply 
be too busy to spend much time 
on romance this week. If you can 
get your sweetheart involved in 

your work in any way, 
two heads are better 
than one.

‘Why I strike’

MADDIE HINKLEY/Daily 

Growing up as “that one Asian 

kid” in a community where the 
average civilian resembled Gary 
Busey more than myself, I devised 
several methods to fit in with 
the other children at school. I 
wore chic American clothes, like 
stripped, glittery V-necks from 
Justice, and I pretended to have 
an intense passion for all things 
equestrian so a pig-tailed horse 
girl would befriend me. One of 
the early routines I adopted to be 
cool was eating the food my mom 
packed for me as quickly and dis-
creetly as possible, because it was 
absolutely nothing like what the 
other girls at my table had. There 
were days that I came home after 
school and told my mom I’d sim-
ply “forgotten” to eat the kimbap 
she woke up at 6 a.m. to assemble 
for me. I probably thought if I ate 
enough mashed potatoes, every-
one who looked at me would see 
a blue-eyed blonde instead of the 
pasty, bifocaled Korean I clearly 
was.

I am the proud daughter of 

immigrants who raised me in 
an agrarian town where food 
options, for an Asian fob, were 
nonexistent. (We had one sad 
“Chinese” buffet whose highlight 
was a vanilla soft-serve machine.) 
It would have been easy to raise 
me on a diet of Hamburger Helper 
and grilled cheese sandwiches, 
but instead my parents went to 
great lengths to ensure we could 
retain the cuisine of our culture 
at home. Comfort food was not to 
become one more sacrifice they 
had to suffer in the name of the 
American Dream. And as I grew, 
so did my appreciation for Kore-
an food. (In retrospect, I can’t 
believe that as a kid I would have 
preferred the synthetic cheese 
and bland ham of Lunchables to 
laboriously marinated meats laid 
out over a freaking pillow of white 
rice.) Every ingredient which had 
embarrassed me before — copious 
spoonfuls of garlic, pungent kim-
chi, roasted seaweed which clung 
to the teeth — just came together 
as delicious food I felt incredibly 
lucky to have at the table, cooked 
fresh every day.

Korean food takes patience 

and dedication. My mom will 
slice away every spare strip of fat 
from our short ribs. She spends 
days preparing her rich ox-bone 
broth, and weeks to ferment and 
pickle half a dozen side dishes. My 
dad delights in searing a perfect, 

medium steak for his family, test-
ing new recipes, making inscruta-
bly terrible food puns (preferably 
about nachos) and using tongs and 
scissors to fry us immorally indul-
gent slabs of pork belly. They dem-
onstrate how to eat mussels with a 
single shell and entreat me to take 
the crispiest portion of a fish — the 
tail. We each get one bowl of rice, 
the food placed in the center com-
munally, and we dig in together.

Food, for my parents and for 

many immigrant parents, is an 
expression of pure love. My mom 
will debone a whole fried sword-
fish and make sure I have plenty 
of the meat before she lifts a single 
grain of rice to her mouth. If I’m 
ever too busy to come to the table, 
she’ll wrap pork, rice, garlic, a jala-
peño slice and a generous heap of 
ssamjang in a lettuce leaf, walk to 
my desk, jam it in my mouth and 
tell me not to work so hard. K-BBQ 
fed to you by your umma just 
hits different. A love expressed 
through food is quiet and unas-
suming, like East Asia’s cultural 
status quo, but the reward is a 
complex medley of deep, spicy, 
garlicky, sweet and earthy flavors 
which play off of each other and 
warm you from within. It tastes 
like home. When I went to college, 
I realized I hadn’t appreciated the 
full extent of my parents’ efforts 
and I craved home food and cut 
fruits more than ever. Nowa-
days, I’m off the meal plan and 
I take buses to Korean grocery 
stores and try to learn — though 
I can never quite replicate the fla-
vor —to cook my mom’s recipes 
myself. I text her asking how to 
make budae jjigae and she replies 
with bafflingly rough estimations 
of her cooking process (“when 
you’ve chopped up enough onions, 
you’ll know”) followed by “good 
luck!” and a smiley face or heart 
emojis. I host dumpling parties 
with my closest friends where we 
sit around the table and whine 
about being single and applying 
to internships while folding meat 
filling into pale dough wrappers, 
just like I grew up doing with my 
family. And when I visit my big 
sister in Seattle, she always has a 
hot, Korean meal set on the table, 
waiting for me. Whenever I’m 
exhausted from a long flight out 
West, all it takes is the sight of 
a steaming odaeng broth on the 
stove to remind myself that family 
is worth crossing any borders and 
taking any risks for. Together, my 
sister and I try to hold onto these 
precious remnants of our parents’ 
love and, my God, do they taste 
delicious.

The sixth love language

 JESSICA KWON

MiC Columnist

The vast majority of my free 

time this quarantine was spent 
streaming movies and television 
shows. I found solace in loung-
ing around on whichever piece of 
furniture seemed most comfort-
able that day and spending hours 
fully engrossed in fictional and far 
away worlds. The TV show “I May 
Destroy You,” created by Michaela 
Coel, took me to an entirely differ-
ent state of mind. The HBO series, 
set in London, follows Arabella, a 
young Black writer, and her group 
of friends as she juggles work 
life, family, friends and romantic 
relationships after being sexually 
assaulted.

While numerous aspects of the 

twelve-episode series were excit-
ing, puzzling and even triggering, 
the most notable theme that stuck 
with me was the importance of 
portraying imperfect people on 
screen. This realization immedi-
ately made me think of the ‘single 
story,’ a phrase coined by the 
author Chimamanda Ngozi Adich-
ie during her 2009 TedTalk titled 
“The danger of a single story.” 
She speaks about the dangers of 
oversimplified stories or ideas we 
form about individuals, groups of 
people or entire countries. Speak-
ing in generalizations is harmful 
and erases any kind of dignity or 
possibility of seeing each other as 
full human beingsand not just one 
part of a monolith.

Coel sincerely invests in decon-

structing the ‘single story’ of sex-
ual assault, showing that sexual 
assault looks differently for every 
individual who experiences it. 

Throughout the series, we see 
five different incidents of sexual 
assault. Each survivor responds 
in such different ways, making it 
impossible to force into a single 
narrative, character or plotline. 

This is an applaudable feat as 

media portrayals of people who 
survive traumatic experiences 
can often be stereotypical. High-
lighting varying experiences with 
sexual assault shows that no one 
survivor, perpetrator or environ-
ment is the same as one another. 
It is vital to understand that every 
survivor of sexual assault process-
es trauma in different ways, there-
fore we must reject the single story 
of the ‘perfect victim.’

It is for this reason that the 

characters are written to be hon-
est and flawed; no character is 
fully good or fully evil. Coel cap-
tures the messiness, the confu-
sion, the denial, the anger, the grief 
and the acceptance that may come 
after being assaulted and how that 
can play out in daily life. “I May 
Destroy You” makes us ask our-
selves, can we really judge an indi-
vidual until we’ve experienced the 
same trauma and triumphs that 
they have?

By understanding this and writ-

ing with respect and nuance to the 
complexities of sexual assault, 
Michaela Coel has created a 
show that resonates with viewers 
worldwide, including myself. This 
series truly strives to bring more 
voices and varying experiences 
into light while forcing audiences 
to be introspective. In the end, she 
leaves us with a powerful message 
that after the dust fades (while 
some may still linger), trauma does 
not define the individual, and nei-
ther can we.

Opinion

I

t has been 218 days since the 
first COVID-19 case on United 
States soil and there is still no 

organized national testing strategy. 
Despite being warned ten times by 
public health experts as early as Jan. 
18 about the threat the virus posed 
to our country, President Donald 
Trump 
and 
his 
administration 

failed — and are continuing to fail 
— to take the pandemic seriously. 
Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top 
infectious disease expert for decades, 
claimed “no one is going to deny 
fewer lives would have been lost had 
the administration acted sooner. 
What’s been less clear amid all the 
chaos is that this global pandemic, an 
unprecedented catastrophe that has 
so far taken the lives of over 180,000 
Americans, is unfortunately also a 
microcosm of the climate crisis.”

Whenever there is a crisis, there 

are always those with reactionary 
politics who are quick to downplay 
the threat or even completely deny its 
existence. With the pandemic, that 
takes the form of anti-maskers, anti-
vaxxers and conspiracy theorists. 
By now everyone has seen at least 
one video of someone refusing to 
put on a mask inside a grocery store 
or shopping center. While it can be 
entertaining to watch grown adults 
scream and whine about having to 
wear a face-covering for 15 minutes, 
it does reflect extremely poorly on 
the political climate of the country. 

From “5G causes COVID-19” to 

“Bill Gates is tracking people with the 
vaccine,” the number of conspiracy 
theories gaining traction in the U.S. 
right now is incredibly dangerous. 
These 
theories 
may 
contribute 

to the skepticism surrounding a 
potential 
COVID-19 
vaccine; 
a 

recent Gallup poll found that one 
in three Americans would not get a 
free Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) approved COVID-19 vaccine 
that is estimated to be ready for 
distribution in early 2021. The Mayo 
Clinic estimated that for contagious 
diseases the ideal percentage of the 
population to reach herd immunity 
is in the ballpark of 70 percent. If the 
Gallup poll ends up being accurate, 

the 65 percent of Americans that 
would be willing to be vaccinated 
for COVID-19 might not reach the 
percentage necessary for widespread 
immunity, causing the pandemic to 
drag on longer.

This same skepticism is seen 

in 
conversations 
about 
climate 

change, with conservatives arguing 
climate change is natural and global 
temperature always varies over 
time. Trump has even gone as far 
as to tweet in 2012, “the concept of 
global warming was created by and 
for the Chinese in order to make U.S. 
manufacturing 
non-competitive,” 

despite having signed a letter in 
2009 urging then-President Barack 
Obama to support a global climate 
deal. Surprising no one that pays 
attention to the future of the planet, 
NASA reported that 97 percent of 
climate scientists believe climate 
change is a man-made phenomenon. 
Many 
climate 
scientists 
have 

suggested a deadline of 2030 to stop 
global temperatures from rising 
more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (34.7 
degrees Fahrenheitper year, or the 
damage caused to the planet will be 
irreversible. 

Even with scientists emphasizing 

2030, 
neither 
of 
our 
current 

presidential candidates have a plan to 
hit that target. While Trump has no 
policies or plans on his website — and 
the Republican Party has even gone so 
far as to have no platform at all at their 
convention — Joe Biden does. His 
climate plan currently sets a date of 
2035 to implement a carbon-neutral 
power grid. Biden campaigned in 
the Democratic primary with the 
target date of 2050, but thanks to 
the advocacy and tireless work of 
Rep. 
Alexandria 
Ocasio-Cortez, 

D-NY, the Sunrise Movement and 
environmental activists nationwide, 
he has moved up the date to 2035. 
While it is certainly an improvement, 
it does not go far enough.

This inaction repeats a pattern all 

too familiar during the COVID-19 
crisis: politicians failing to listen to 
public health experts and take public 
health crises seriously. Esteemed 
scientists, trained experts, have 

provided 
political 
leaders 
with 

data and have pronounced their 
scientific opinions, but, amazingly, 
politicians refuse to act in a manner 
that meets the moment. Throughout 
the pandemic, we have seen a 
massive failure of government to 
act and actually provide help for the 
millions of Americans who have been 
devastated by an economy not seen 
since the Great Depression. Congress 
provided a one-time stimulus check of 
just $1,200 and then discontinued the 
previously-expanded unemployment 
insurance when it ran out a few 
weeks ago. 

Because of the failure at all levels 

of government, it comes down to 
communities to care for those who 
need it most. An example from New 
York City is “community fridges” 
that were set up in the low-income 
neighborhoods that were hit hardest 
by COVID-19 and the economic 
downturn. These fridges were free, 
accessible to anyone who needed 
food and stocked by neighbors, 
helping 
each 
other 
whenever 

community 
members 
had 
any 

leftovers. 

In the midst of all this economic 

and humanitarian failure, everyone 
wants to go back to a “normal,” 
which has caused the rush in 
reopening schools and corners to be 
cut in treatment approval. But this is 
a strategy that will lead to even more 
disastrous results if it is repeated 
with the climate crisis. Navigating 
these crises takes time and patience, 
and we must learn from past failures 
if we are going to stand any chance 
against what a disrupted climate will 
be throwing at us. The government’s 
handling of COVID-19 highlights 
the necessity to act urgently. 
Fortunately, Ann Arbor is leading 
by example having unanimously 
passed the A2Zero initiative last 
June. Cities like ours have begun to 
take the matter of future survival 
into their own hands and are finally 
treating climate change as the 
existential threat that it is. 

COVID-19 is a practice test for the climate crisis

ALEXANDER NOBEL | COLUMNIST

D

espite 
smears 
framing 

GEO as duplicitous and 
untrustworthy, a careful 

analysis of the timeline demonstrates 
that GEO has continually negotiated in 
good faith and it is the administration 
that has been operating recklessly.

On the evening of Sept. 7, the 

University of Michigan’s Graduate 
Employee 
Organization 
officially 

announced its intent to strike after 
fighting all summer for its platform 
of demands for a safe and just 
campus. University administrators 
immediately discredited GEO as 
hostile and noncompliant, responding 
with communication tactics that 
divert attention from the work 
stoppage platform in an attempt to 
sidestep any real engagement. At that 
moment, our movement entered public 
awareness and gained the solidarity of 
individuals and organizations across 
the country. For many, the intricate 
root system supporting this shoot 
of defiance remains invisible, but it 
should come as no surprise that this 
unrest did not develop overnight. The 
administration’s words ring hollow 
when we take a closer look at the 
timeline of events leading up to GEO’s 
decision to strike. This University’s 
administration has made a habit of 
sweeping the concerns of students, 
faculty and staff under the rug, 
prioritizing financial gain over the 
well-being of our community and the 
grossly mismanaged reopening plan is 
no exception. The difference is that the 
stakes of the current moment could not 
be higher. 

Beginning in late April, the 

administration gave GEO leadership 
the run-around in an effort to sideline 
good-faith negotiations. According 
to GEO Member Yael Kenan, the 
union’s attempts to engage with the 
University’s 
COVID-19 
reopening 

plans were bounced back and forth 
between the Rackham Graduate 
School 
and 
Academic 
Human 

Resources, who both threw up their 
hands and declared that our demands 
were 
outside 
their 
wheelhouse. 

They preempted any criticism of the 
University’s policies by declaring our 
critical ethical concerns beyond the 
scope of our bargaining contract. 
These included the universal right to 
remote work without documentation, 
policing and surveillance concerns 
and cutting ties with the United 
States Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement, among others. 

To add to the frustration, the 

University was determined to discuss 
its reopening plan without ensuring 
that graduate students had a seat at 
the table. “It would literally cost them 
nothing to include us,” says Kenan. 
Despite the fact that inviting a GEO or 
other graduate student representative 
to these meetings presented minimal 
risk or inconvenience to the University, 
Kenan says the administration refused 
point-blank to entertain our requests 
to this end. As the weeks passed, 
it became increasingly clear that 
bargaining was not going to yield the 
desired outcome. 

The combination of exclusion and 

relentless filibustering found GEO with 
little choice remaining but to withhold 
labor. The first public mention of the 
intent to go on strike in the event that 
our platform would go unaddressed 
appeared in The Michigan Daily 
on Aug. 31, and GEO leadership had 
notified 
uncooperative 
University 

administrators of this possibility 
many times in the weeks and months 
preceding as alternative options began 
to be exhausted. In light of all this, a 
panicked email from Provost Susan 
M. Collins at 11:17 p.m. that night made 
the utterly absurd claim that they have 
“only learned today” of GEO’s intent 

to strike. It reveals that she and her 

fellow administrators are thoroughly 

out of touch with what is going on 
with their students, or else willing to 
lie through their teeth in an attempt 
to save face. Either option is equally 
damning. 

Overwhelmingly, the University’s 

response has mischaracterized GEO’s 
decision to strike, our demands and 
prior steps GEO had taken to avoid 
the strike. The rhetoric used in both 
internal and external coverage of the 
protests, rallies and work stoppage 
has sought to paint the University 
administrators 
as 
victims 
who 

have been working tirelessly with 
unreasonable graduate students, only 
to be blindsided when they supposedly 
learned on Labor Day, Sept. 7, that 
labor stoppages would commence 
the next day. Yet at that point, GEO 
leadership had already spent months 
engaging in a fruitless and infuriating 
dialogue with the University. This 
is by no means a new problem: The 
University’s 
decentralization 
of 

decision-making consistently obscures 
who is responsible for a given issue, 
rendering failures in communication 
and enforcement common. 

One deceptive statement is that the 

University is “not aware of any graduate 
student who is being required to teach 
in person against their expressed 
preference.” Collins made this claim 
in her email on Labor Day, and it has 
been cited repeatedly as evidence that 
the rationale behind this strike has no 
foundation. Unfortunately, it simply is 
not true. Graduate Student Instructors, 
who will remain anonymous out of 
fear of retribution, have come to GEO 
expressing concerns about in-person 
work, including scenarios in which 
the student was assigned a teaching 
placement requiring in-person work 
despite explicitly requesting a remote-
only assignment. Without a universal 
right to work remotely, we cannot 
guarantee that all are in a secure 
position to make the appropriate 
decision for themselves free of the 
threat of retaliation. The situation is 
further complicated by the fact that 
Collins’s claim is based on a survey 
conducted in early July when the fall 
reopening plan was not yet public. 

Moreover, that survey had tiers 

for who “deserved” remote work 
based on subjective values. It is not a 
valid measure of how GSIs and other 
instructional staff currently feel about 
in-person teaching. GSIs have told us 
they feel coerced into “volunteering” 
for in-person work out of a sense 
of altruism, given the University’s 
messaging 
regarding 
in-person 

teaching as a “shared responsibility,” 
or fear of retaliation from their faculty 
and departments. This is especially 
true for masters’ students, who do not 
have funding guarantees and express 
severe concerns about retaliation. 

If everyone who wants to work 

remotely is already allowed to do so, 
then the University should make it 
a policy since it supposedly would 
not change anything. Meeting this 
demand is low-hanging fruit, yet the 
administration has not offered the 
universal right to remote work nor 
provided reasoning beyond baseless 
assurances that it is unnecessary. 
Their reticence belies their true 
concern: that the option for universal 
remote work would likely result in 
fewer in-person classes. Universal 
remote work is only one of many 
planks in the GEO strike platform; 
the 
discourse 
presented 
diverts 

attention from the others while 
appearing to discredit the platform as 
absurdly positioned and divides our 
community.

Furthermore, 
the 
University 

administration 
claimed 
that 
it 

only had $1.3 billion available for 
COVID-19 response — a claim later 
undermined by an independent audit. 
GEO’s COVID Caucus wrote an open 

letter to the administration that was 
signed by more than 1800 individuals 
and major student organizations 
and presented to administrators on 
May 8. It was dismissed out of hand 
on the grounds that the requests 
were 
not 
“financially 
feasible.” 

GEO repeatedly sought financial 
transparency around the response, 
and on May 13, the administration 
was presented with a second petition 
circulated by the Huron Valley Area 
Labor Federation that also called for 
greater transparency. This time the 
administration did not even deign to 
respond.

By May 28, the independent audit 

of the University’s finances revealed 
a sum of approximately $6.7 billion 
was in fact available for COVID-19 
response and could easily cover all 
of the necessary spending required 
to meet our COVID-19 related 
demands. Once again, this came as 
a disappointment but not a surprise. 
Despite this institution’s routine 
deployment of scarcity narratives to 
justify austerity policies, the evidence 
from the independent audit revealed 
that this is simply not the case.

The Board of Regents were charged 

with oversight of various committees 
that 
drafted 
reports 
on 
safely 

reopening the University in the midst 
of the pandemic. The Coordinating 
Committee on Instructional Planning 
drafted a report on reopening on May 
29, and about a week later, on June 8, 
the Ethics and Privacy Committee 
finalized 
their 
own 
report 
on 

reopening. It is worthwhile to note 
that the decision to open campus 
preceded the formation of the Ethics 
and Privacy Committee: “We were 
not tasked with assessing the ethics 
of whether or not to reopen. Instead, 
we were asked to assess the ethics of 
different measures that might be used 
if we reopened,” one member of the 
committee explained in an internal 
email to the authors.

As such, their report highlights 

issues 
like 
the 
inadequacy 
of 

symptom-based 
screening 
alone, 

which would fail to catch the 
25%-40% of those infected who 
never develop symptoms, and the 
necessity of “testing (for viral RNA 
or proteins) to determine prevalence 
of the infection, identify infected 
individuals who are symptomatic 
or asymptomatic carriers, identify 
contacts, 
and 
inform 
necessary 

mitigation 
is 
essential 
to 
an 

organized response to the COVID-
19 pandemic.” That same member 
reports being disappointed in the 
decision to reopen, but still “willing 
to give them the benefit of the doubt 
at that relatively early stage that 
all needed safeguards would be in 
place.” The member gave credit to 
the administration for forming the 
committee at all, though it was clear 
they were strictly advisory.

But as the summer wore on, 

the University doubled down on 
its reopening plan even as the 
national 
situation 
deteriorated. 

During the month of July, University 
President Mark Schlissel responded 
noncommittally to personal emails 
from at least one member of the 
EPC as well as a collectively-written 
follow-up letter that strongly implied 
reopening was no longer feasible. 
Ultimately, he brushed them aside by 
stating he appreciated their concern, 
but the University intended to 
proceed with reopening anyways.

n 
a 
classic 
scene 
from 

Spongebob Squarepants, Mr. 
Krabs opens the door of the 

Krusty Krab to find Plankton and his 
vast army of green, redneck relatives. 
Krabs, not realizing what the mob 
surrounding his restaurant is, asks 
Plankton, “You planted grass?” The 
obvious condescension with which 
Krabs poses the question implies 
that he doesn’t find a massive ring of 
grass around his place of business to 
be threatening. Krabs, however, had 
never visited suburban America.

I 
was 
recently 
tasked 
with 

mowing a lawn in my neighborhood 
in East Lansing, Mich. Due to some 
particularly dry weather this summer, 
the lawn in question was not Spartan 
green. While I was rubbing my eyes to 
remove the irritating bits of dead grass 
that the lawnmower was coughing up, 
I realized that lawns are nothing but a 
total waste of time and resources.

Before you, dear reader, assume the 

role of the armchair psychologist and 
pin my newfound hatred of grass on 
my distaste for the chore of mowing 
lawns, know that my grudge against 
the lawn isn’t just personal. The cost 
of maintaining a whole yard’s worth 
of grass, in terms of water, space and 
time is a burden not just upon my 
fellow lawn tenders and me, but upon 
society and the environment.

While we have grown accustomed 

to seeing grass just about everywhere 
and might think that it belongs in as 
many places as we see it, the truth is 
that for grass to keep its deep green 

color and plush springiness, it needs 
quite a bit of water — more than 
many American climates tend to 
provide in the summer. As a result, 
Americans use nearly 9 billion 
gallons of water per day to keep their 
lawns healthy, per Environmental 
Protection Agency estimates. For the 
average household, some 30 percent 
of water used is allocated to outdoor 
usage, primarily thirsty lawns. In 
certain regions, especially the West 
and Southwest, that figure can be 
closer to 60 percent. Considering the 
frequency with which that region 
experiences droughts — like the one 
responsible for California’s current 
crop of wildfires — using that much 
water to make sure your yard has 
a nice, luscious layer of grass on it 
seems inherently wasteful. And when 
one considers that those droughts are 
going to become even more common 
in upcoming years thanks to our 
friend climate change, it becomes 
worse than wasteful: It becomes 
irresponsible.

What do we need grass for, 

anyway? We cover most of our lawns 
with it, but how is all of that space 
used? Most of the time, it isn’t. A 
graduation party here or a Fourth 
of July cookout there might allow 
a grassy yard to be used to its full 
extent. But those events could be 
enjoyed on a nice brick patio or even 
at public parks, which might see 
increased use, interest and funding 
if Americans abandon the false idol 
of the grassy yard and turn to more 

efficient spaces to satisfy their only 
occasional desires for large outdoor 
gatherings. 

Some grass holdouts might look 

beyond these types of private, yet 
sizable gatherings to justify their 
lawns. “What about the children?” 
they’ll ask. “Where are they supposed 
to frolic and play?” And I’ll respond: 
“What about them? They’ll enjoy 
the trip to the park as much as the 
playtime itself, and besides, most 
of them would rather be playing 
Fortnite anyway.”

Where would all of this space — 

previously hogged by the vertically-
challenged villain known as grass 
— go, you ask? Well, I have a fancy 
new word for you: xeriscape. This is 
a school of landscaping design that 
prescribes the use of native plants 
in place of grass. These plants aren’t 
usually the kind you can walk on, 
but in exchange for the lost space, 
you get a garden that is much more 
interesting to look at and, because 
they’re native, much more suited to 
survive on the amount of water that 
comes out of the sky than a mat of 
boring old grass.

If 
xeriscaping 
still 
sounds 

unappealing, 
maybe 
you 
will 

find 
another 
alternative 
worth 

examining: getting rid of the front 
yard altogether.

A

s students and faculty at 
the University of Michigan 
started their second week of 

the fall semester, a day was set aside 
to observe Labor Day. In a Twitter 
post on Monday, GEO wrote, “(Our) 
membership has authorized a strike, 
effective (Tuesday). This is a historic 
moment: we are striking at the 
beginning of the year, in the midst 
of a pandemic, to protect our whole 
community.” On Tuesday, Sept. 8, 
the day after the national holiday, 
members of the Graduate Employees’ 
Organization and their supporters 
convened before daybreak on the 
dark campus, with cardboard signs, 
raincoats and courage. As the early 
morning rain and thunderstorms 
caused the marked words of “U-M 
Makes Us Sick” to bleed, individuals 
popped 
open 
umbrellas 
and 

began the first day of their strike 
against the University’s inadequate 
reopening plans. On Wednesday 
evening, a historic number of GEO 
members congregated to discuss 
an offer presented to them by the 
University. With an overwhelming 
majority, membership rejected the 
offer, concluding that it inadequately 
addressed their demands and did not 
express any continued progress. 

During a deadly pandemic with 

cases rising in college hotspots 
around the country as a result of 
tens of thousands of students and 
faculty returning from around the 
globe, university environments and 
administrations were devastatingly 
unprepared. With approximately five 

months to plan for the fall semester 
after classes moved to virtual formats 
in mid-March, students, faculty and 
the greater Ann Arbor community 
hoped that the University and their 
public health experts would create 
effective and safe plans for the fall. 
Within the first two weeks of the 
majority of students being back on 
campus, many feel they have not. 
In an interview with The Daily, 
GEO Secretary Amir Fleischmann 
commented, “We’re striking over 
the University’s totally inadequate 
reopening plans and just the series 
of policies they put in place over the 
summer that’s making students and 
workers on campus unsafe.” 

Fleischmann 
continued, 
“It’s 

important because GEO is supporting 
the safety of everyone on campus. 
One of the reasons is the University’s 
totally inadequate testing policy, 
which doesn’t include randomized 
testing of asymptomatic people, 
which all experts, including the 
University’s own (experts), think is 
necessary for a safe campus.” 

In 
addition 
to 
striking 
in 

response to reopening plans, GEO 
is also concerned about the lack of 
communication and transparency 
from the University administration 
during the implementation of the 
Michigan 
Ambassadors 
program 

and resulting partnerships with 
the Ann Arbor Police Department 
and the Division of Public Safety 
and Security. After a particularly 
momentous summer that centered 
on the national protests against police 

brutality, violence and racial injustices, 
the University’s ploy to work with 
law enforcement to police students 
did not sit well with the community. 
Motivated by fear for livelihood, 
health, security and the future during 
a pandemic and civil rights movement, 
hundreds of people have gathered 
across campus to stand in solidarity 
with graduate students. 

However, 
in 
an 
email 
to 

undergraduate 
students 
on 

Wednesday morning, Susan M. 
Collins, provost and executive vice 
president for academic affairs, wrote, 
“I strongly affirm the importance 
of student perspectives and student 
activism at the University of Michigan. 
The University has a long and 
celebrated history of its community 
members standing up for what they 
believe in through acts of freedom 
of speech and peaceful protest. The 
strike violates Michigan law; in 
addition, GEO has agreed by contract 
not to take actions that interfere with 
the University’s operations, in this 
case, your education. Nonetheless, 
the University’s team will continue 
to meet with GEO in good faith to 
resolve remaining issues.” 

In 1973, after a University policy 

was initiated that would charge 
non-resident graduate employees 
out-of-state tuition for the first 
time as well as a 24-percent tuition 
increase, graduate student employees 
founded 
the 
Organization 
of 

Teaching Fellows, deriving from a 
group that first started organizing 
as “teaching fellows” three years 

prior. The University administration 
refused to recognize the concerns 
of the teaching fellows unless they 
were certified by the Michigan 
Employment Relations Commission, 
an election process that had already 
failed a few years before. OTF began 
loose associations with the American 
Association of University Professors, 
and discussions of a strike were 
underway but never came to pass. 

Shortly thereafter, in the summer 

of 1973, the teaching fellows merged 
with research and staff assistants 
of the University to found the 
Graduate Employees’ Organization. 
In an effort to speed up the process of 
gaining certification, GEO members 
compromised, only calling for their 
recognition as employees of the 
institution. With low stakes, the 
University agreed to GEO negotiations 
for official recognition and there was 
an immediate Michigan Employment 
Relations Commission certification 
election, allowing the organization to 
be certified on April 15, 1974. 

However, things did not continue 

to proceed smoothly for graduate 
student employees. In June 1974, 
negotiations 
for 
a 
contract 
— 

demanding nondiscrimination, better 
working conditions and fair wages — 
began and lasted for months without 
progress. A handful of months later, 
all methods of negotiation were 
enervated, and union members 
decided to strike in 1975. On Feb. 11, 
with no clue of how long the intensive 
picketing and striking would last, 
hundreds of GEO members gathered 

on campus with signs, gloves and 
warm jackets: the onset of a cold 
February. 

In the early days of the strike, 

more than half of undergraduate 
students 
boycotted 
classes 
and 

joined the picket lines to stand in 
solidarity with their teachers, peers 
and fellow academics. Within the 
first week, agreements on affirmative 
action and non-discrimination cases 
were achieved and local workers, 
such as the Michigan Brotherhood 
of 
Teamsters, 
recognized 
the 

importance of the strike and vowed 
to not cross picket lines. The Strike 
for a Contract lasted for a month 
and on March 14, 1975, GEO proved 
successful with its demands and 
achieved tuition reductions, pay 
raises and other benefits.

The current strike against the 

University administration for the 
failure to enact proper safety protocols 
and an effective pandemic plan does 
not reflect new sentiments expressed 
by graduate students. Efforts for 
unionization arrived in a first wave 
throughout the 1960s and ’70s, 
where graduate students at public or 
state universities largely decorated 
the front of picket lines. Cedric de 
Leon, a professor and director of the 
Labor Center at the University of 
Massachusetts Amherst, explained, 
“Graduate 
students 
have 
been 

unionizing 
for 
decades.” 
These 

unionizing efforts were already 
instituted at the University of 
California system schools and the 
University of Michigan when strikes 
at other universities around the 
country happened. In 2016, Columbia 
University graduate students won 
bargaining rights when the National 
Labor Relations Board reversed 
a decision from 12 years earlier at 
Brown University. More recently, in 
June 2019, University of Chicago 
graduate students touted marked 
signs with “Workers’ Rights are 
Human 
Rights” 
and 
chanted 

“recognize our election.” This 
strong history of graduate students 
linking 
arms, 
forming 
picket 

lines and taking up unionization 
efforts has proved critical to the 
situations GEO is faced with in the 
contemporary moment. 

Apart from explicit GEO strikes 

at the University, there have been 
many notable and revolutionary 
protests, sit-ins and strikes worth 
mentioning when examining the 
atmosphere surrounding today’s 
concerns. In June of 1962, a group of 
students met in Port Huron, Mich. 
to discuss their ideologies and goals 
for a new organization, later named 
the Students for the Democratic 
Society. Their ideologies heavily 
reflected the political agendas of the 
New Left, and their quasi-manifesto 

highlights the members’ opinions 
on American society, politics and 
military actions. The creation of 
SDS’s manifesto, denoted as the Port 
Huron Statement, was spearheaded 
by Tom Hayden, a student at 
the University that came from a 
working-class family. An article 
titled “Resistance and Revolution: 
The Anti-Vietnam War Movement 
at the University of Michigan, 1965-
1972” outlines the impact of the Port 
Huron Statement. 

The authors wrote that the 

statement “described the existential 
crisis of many Northern, white 
students as they experienced the 
disillusionment of the world that 
they were growing up in. From the 
campuses of their mega-universities, 
the students and activists witnessed 
the growing risk of nuclear war that 
the Cold War caused and the continual 
violence in the white segregationists’ 
resistance to the civil rights movement. 
The students felt disenfranchised by 
the American Dream that encouraged 
consumerism and conformism while 
alienating people of color and the 
impoverished.” 

This manifesto facilitated the 

much-needed steam and momentum 
that student activists sought during 
the era of the Cold War and the 
Vietnam War. In a Smithsonian 
Magazine interview with former 
SDS president Todd Gitlin, the 
editor wrote, “The 2016 election 
brought student activism back into 
the spotlight. No student activist 
organization in U.S. history has 
matched the scope and influence of 
Students for a Democratic Society 
(SDS), thwe national movement of the 
1960s.”

A few years later in 1968, on the day 

of the burial of Martin Luther King 
Jr., the newly founded Black Student 
Union at the University took over the 
Administration Building. After sitting 
inside for five hours while demanding 
more funding for Black students and 
higher rates of hiring for Black faculty 
members, the members of BSU had 
a discussion with then-President 
Robben Fleming and the lockout 
ended. The conversation between 
Fleming and the members resulted 
in the establishment of the Center for 
Afroamerican and African Studies. 

However, two years after the 

takeover, rates of Black faculty hires 
and Black student enrollment had not 
improved. Students called for a strike, 
campuswide.

E

arlier this year, I watched 
NASA 
astronauts 
Bob 

Behnken and Doug Hurley 

blast off from Cape Canaveral, Fla., 
in a SpaceX rocket. When the roar of 
the rocket’s engine filled the air, I was 
reminded of the boundless potential 
of American science as a tall, sleek 
spacecraft climbed past the outer 
reaches of the earth’s atmosphere.

As exciting as I — and so many 

Americans — found this SpaceX 
rocket launch, there wasn’t anything 
unusual about it. For almost 250 years, 
Americans have been at the forefront 
of science and innovation. Whether it 
has been exploring the depths of space, 
making breakthroughs in medicine or 
lighting up our homes and businesses, 
the American scientific community 
has made the impossible possible, 
transforming countless dreams into 
reality. 

Since public health experts first 

began warning of the threat posed by 
COVID-19, scientific communities 
across 
the 
country 
haven’t 

disappointed one bit. Instead, doctors, 
epidemiologists and others have 
worked tirelessly on the front lines in 
order to eradicate COVID-19 and get 
life back to normal. Whether it be right 
here at the University of Michigan or in 
labs across the country, scientists have 
gone to work to find safe medicines 
and therapeutic, plasma and antibody 
treatments, as well as an effective 
vaccine. Six months since much of the 
nation first went into lockdown, the 
fight against this invisible enemy now 
looks more promising than ever before.

While an effective vaccine remains 

one of our greatest hopes to defeat 
COVID-19, innovators are working 
on countless other fronts in this 
rapidly evolving battle against the 
coronavirus. As this vital effort moves 
full steam ahead, one of the most 
promising advancements has taken 
the form of monoclonal antibody 
treatments, 
which 
are 
already 

undergoing testing by companies such 
as Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. 
and Eli Lilly and Co., according to the 
Wall Street Journal.

At the moment, if someone 

contracts COVID-19 and is in need 
of medical attention, there are few 
options outside of medicines like 
Remdesivir, which might be somewhat 
effective against the coronavirus 
for serious cases. Therefore, these 
monoclonal antibodies — which can 
help prevent patients from developing 
severe cases of COVID-19 — change 
everything in our battle against this 
virus. “The drugs, which are injected 
intravenously or with a short needle, 
have the potential to work soon after 
someone is infected and still feeling 
only slightly sick, stopping the virus in 
its tracks before the seriously afflicted 
would need to be hospitalized,” the 
Wall Street Journal noted. 

This exciting treatment also has 

the potential to prevent somebody 
from contracting COVID-19 in the 
first place, serving as a “temporary 
vaccine.” The United States has 
always prevailed even in the most 
trying times, and it’s become clear that 
monoclonal antibodies are another 
inspiring advancement from our 
nation’s scientific community that 
could help our country turn the page 
on the coronavirus crisis.

Excitingly, monoclonal antibodies 

are just one weapon in our growing 
arsenal against COVID-19. Another 
advancement 
somewhat 
similar 

to these monoclonal antibodies is 
convalescent plasma. As scientists 
have discovered, a patient who 
has been previously infected with 
COVID-19 is likely to have a high 
concentration of antibodies in their 
blood. This convalescent plasma 
treatment takes advantage of these 
antibodies, transferring them to a 
patient who is currently ill with the 
virus and is in serious need of help. 
“Hospitalized patients who received 

the plasma within three days of 
diagnosis, are under the age of 80 
and not on mechanical ventilation, 
benefited the most, with a 35% 
improvement in survival 30 days 
after receiving the transfusion,” the 
Wall Street Journal reported. While 
experts note that convalescent plasma 
treatment doesn’t mean we don’t need 
monoclonal antibody treatments or an 
effective vaccine, this is nonetheless a 
major step in the right direction. Even 
small flickers of hope delivered by 
treatments like convalescent plasma 
mark significant strides from the 
beginning of the pandemic, when we 
knew nothing about how to combat 
COVID-19.

Finally, beyond all of these 

intriguing developments, the most 
promising tool in our battle against 
this pandemic is a safe and successful 
vaccine, which we’re racing toward 
in record time. Although there 
are numerous vaccine candidates 
in development across the globe, 
American companies like Moderna 
Therapeutics and Pfizer remain at 
the forefront of this unprecedented 
effort. With the vaccine being rolled 
out so quickly, some people have 
expressed concern that medical 
officials are rushing the final stages 
of development and testing due to 
political pressure from President 
Donald Trump, who is fighting for 
a second term in the White House 
against former Vice President Joe 
Biden. But health officials have 
repeatedly 
reassured 
Americans 

that the final vaccine distributed to 
patients across the country will be 
safe and effective, and manufacturers 
have pledged that they will not 
release a vaccine to the general public 
until it is safe for all Americans. 

A

s schools around the country 
reverse their face-to-face 
reopening plans, it seems 

less and less likely that the University 
of Michigan will make it through the 
first few weeks of classes with the 
current hybrid model. If classes get 
moved to be fully remote, the blame 
will be shifted to students — it could 
have worked, but we just weren’t 
“responsible” enough. 

In an interview with The Daily, 

President 
Mark 
Schlissel 
said 

he “get(s) a little insulted when 
everybody says there’s no way that 
students are going to wear masks, 
and there’s no way that they’re 
not going to party in dangerous 
fashions ... I think you can and will 
step up as a community.” 

Here’s the thing: Even if 99 

percent of the U-M undergraduate 
student body are compliant, choose 
not to party, social distance and 
wash their hands, we could 
still have a massive community 
outbreak. As of Aug. 6 — well before 
tens of thousands of students from 
around the country descended upon 
Ann Arbor — a single gathering of 
100 students at a party (one-third 
of 1 percent of the undergraduate 
population) carried between a 30 
to 50 percent chance that someone 
had COVID-19. It is probably much 
higher now that students from states 
with higher incidence rates have 
returned to campus. 

Furthermore, while partying 

may be the most dangerous thing 
college-aged students can do 
right now, many students also 
must work service industry jobs 
which put them at risk. A recent 
Atlantic article rightly pointed out 
that a recent rise in cases in people 
under 35 would be predictable 
irrespective of parties, as newly-
opened restaurants and bars are 
overwhelmingly staffed by young 
people.

An outbreak would be difficult 

to control even if every person on 
campus were required to get tested, 
but only students living on-campus, 
about a quarter of students overall, 
carry that requirement. One party is 
enough for a residence hall outbreak, 
or several. The problem is that 
President Schlissel’s plan relies on 
100 percent compliance, something 
that he, as a medical professional and 
rational adult, should understand is 
utterly unrealistic. The opening of 
campus isn’t a reasonable risk, it is 
a recipe for a clusterfuck, as put so 
eloquently by The Daily Tar Heel.

The confusing part is that 

Schlissel understands compliance 
is unrealistic. In an email to faculty 
and staff on Aug. 18, he wrote, “after 
a few weeks, non-compliance among 
students might become common,” as 
a way to defend why the University 
will not be doing large-scale testing 
on asymptomatic individuals. It 
must take some mental gymnastics 
to write an email effectively saying 
there will be too much virus in the 
community to test, but we are going 
to open anyway. Research indicates 
that in the case of coronavirus 
testing, quantity is better than 
quality, and testing all students every 
two days is recommended. If this is 
impossible, as Schlissel suggests, we 
cannot open, period. 

Personal 
responsibility 
is 

important, but it is not the solution 
to a public health crisis. Don’t 
get me wrong, when I see people 
posting pictures of their parties 
and group events, I get angry. I 
think it is selfish and irresponsible 
to be hanging out in large groups 
of people. That said, 20-year-olds 
should not be responsible for the 
health of the nation. Irresponsibility 
is not a “risk” in the 18 to 22 year 
old age group, it is a given. Willful 
ignorance is the only explanation 
for President Schlissel’s refusal to 

recognize the impracticality of a 
plan predicated on the notoriously 
excellent 
decision-making 
skills 

of young adults. Countries that 
have 
successfully 
curbed 
this 

virus do not have supernaturally 
responsible 
young 
people; 
they 

have competent leadership that 
managed to control the virus before 
widespread quarantine fatigue set 
in. From New Zealand to Rwanda, 
swift governmental response with 
strong messaging and actions that 
emphasized scientific expertise has 
controlled, if not eliminated the virus. 

President Schlissel is not a 

governmental figure, but he does 
have the power to make decisions 
that will impact the health of tens 
of thousands of people. He is 
not making decisions in the best 
interest of the U-M community or 
the broader Ann Arbor community. 
He is making decisions in the 
best interest of the University’s 
bottom line. One could argue this 
is also a failure of the government 
or at the least, a flaw in our system. 
In countries where tuition is free, I 
don’t think they are panicking about 
enrollment numbers. Students have 
every right to question whether an 
online education is worth the same 
cost (or 1.9 percent more). If school 
were free, what would there be to 
question? 

The virus is not Schlissel’s fault 

and the lack of control in this country 
is not his fault, but any disease or 
death that results from the opening 
of campus? That is his fault. Schlissel 
has all of the science he needs to see 
that opening is not the way to go. 
If a statement comes out blaming 
students, I hope the Michigan 
community calls it out. A plan that 
relies on 100 percent compliance to 
work is not a plan, it’s a prayer.

Opinion
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

A

s members of the faculty at 
the University of Michigan, 
we are deeply troubled by 

the administration’s response to the 
ongoing strike led by many of our 
graduate students.

The administration has been quick 

to characterize the strike as “illegal.” 
But so were many of the strikes that 
make up the history of the labor 
movement worldwide. Strikes are by 
definition meant to disrupt business 
as usual.

The 
Graduate 
Employees 

Organization has made several 
important demands with regard to 
the administration’s reopening of the 
campus in the midst of the COVID-
19 pandemic. GEO has persistently 
raised concerns about the lack or 
inconsistency of testing, tracing, 
quarantine, 
distancing, 
masking 

and other actions that would help 
improve safety and reduce infection 
spread on campus and in the 
surrounding community. 

GEO’s insistence on a universal, 

unqualified right to work remotely is 
in the best interest of the broader U-M 
community. While the University has 
consistently responded that they are 
“not aware” of any coercion to teach 
in-person or in a hybrid format, they 
have also refused to institute such a 
guarantee as university policy.

The health and safety of the 

community are also at the heart of 

GEO’s demands regarding policing. 
In recognition of the persistence 
of police violence and surveillance, 
which 
disproportionately 
impact 

the communities of individuals that 
are Black, Indigenous and people 
of color, GEO has called for the 
redirecting of 50% of the funding 
allocated to the Division of Public 
Safety and Security to community-
based justice initiatives. They have 
also asked that the University cut 
ties with the Ann Arbor Police 
Department and with Immigration 
and Customs Enforcement. As the 
#BBUM campaign has powerfully 
documented the “unique experiences 
of being black at Michigan” since 2013, 
Black students regularly experience 
racism on the part of both campus and 
city police. We must also remember 
the 2014 killing of Aura Rosser by Ann 
Arbor police, for which the officer 
responsible was promoted and the 
then-chief of AAPD was later hired 
by the University as the Director of 
Housing Security for DPSS. 

GEO’s demands for reallocating 

funding from DPSS and cutting 
ties from AAPD are particularly 
pertinent in light of the University’s 
forming of student ambassador 
teams, which effectively recruit 
and employ students to become 
extensions of the campus police and 
surveil their peers. The money spent 
on this programming could easily be 

used for COVID-19 testing, personal 
protective equipment or remote 
learning — any number of things that 
would make our campus safer for all.

Most recently, residential advisers 

at the University have initiated a work 
stoppage to protest their working 
conditions, as have dining hall 
workers. Like the members of GEO, 
R.A.s used the official channels to 
voice their concerns before taking this 
measure. As non-unionized student 
employees, many of whom come from 
working-class families, they take a 
considerable risk in their collective 
action. Like our striking graduate 
students, they have determined that 
the risks to themselves and to the 
campus community posed by the 
University’s reopening plan outweigh 
the risks of going on strike.

We are deeply disappointed that, 

while so many of the University’s 
constituents 
bravely 
risk 
their 

livelihoods to raise grave concerns 
about public health and safety on 
campus, the administration has used 
procedures and technicalities to 
silence, delegitimize or ignore their 
concerns. Some of the University’s 
language — along with its use of 
non-disparagement clauses — carry 
an implicit threat of retaliation. We 
are gravely concerned about the 
language of intimidation deployed 
in the University’s response to GEO 
and in its communication with 

faculty about the strike. We believe 
that those striking and protesting do 
so for the health and safety of both 

the University and surrounding 

community, envisioning a more 
robust and just culture of care that 
all members of our campus and 
neighboring communities deserve.

The University’s official response 

and attitude to the demands and 
concerns raised by GEO echo 
attempts by the administration 
to undermine faculty governance 
and obfuscate the communications 

of the faculty during COVID-19 
by ignoring or dismissing faculty 
petitions and protests over the 
campus reopening plan. 

We express here a concerted 

show of faculty solidarity with GEO, 
our graduate students and R.A.s, and 
demand a more forceful and concrete 
condemnation by the administration 
of the assaults to which people of 
color and immigrants are subjected 
on a daily basis. 

We call for a more serious 

engagement by the University in 

hearing and responding to GEO’s 
important and timely demands. To 
sign the letter, please complete this

UNIVERSITY FACULTY | OP-ED

Faculty letter supporting GEO strike

M

y morning routine has 
been the same for years. 
I wake up to the blaring 

sound of my alarm, and as soon as 
I touch my phone to turn it off, I 
have an instinctual reaction to open 
up Instagram and scroll through 
my feed. I am normally greeted 
with genuine pictures of friends, 
aesthetically pleasing nature photos 
from someone’s most recent vacation 
or a funny meme that offers a good 
morning laugh. However, Instagram 
has looked much different in the past 
few months. 

Between the COVID-19 pandemic 

and social justice movements, most 
people I follow have turned away 
from sharing light-hearted, personal 
material and have shifted to using 
their platform as a tool to educate 
their followers on societal issues 
and raise awareness. The beauty 
of social media is that it’s not just a 
way for users to keep their followers 
updated on themselves, but rather a 
way to connect and share valuable 
information across the globe, which is 
crucial during a divisive time like this. 

September is here, which means 

that it’s time for most college students 
to head back to campus. As students 
make this transition, the educational 
posts and stories remain present, 
but personal posts are starting to 
trickle in once again. The latter is 
not problematic alone; however, if 
a social media user’s personal life 
starts to contradict what their profile 
preaches — for example, if they 
constantly post about the importance 
of social distancing but fail to distance 
themselves — then it becomes an issue. 
Why preach what you don’t practice? 

Using social media as a tool to 

educate and spread awareness is more 
important now than ever. We are in 
the midst of a transformative time 
period in terms of our approach to 
public health and social justice, such 

as the Black Lives Matter movement. 
I applaud those who take time to find 
pertinent information and share it 
with their friends. Yet, I question 
those who do so, then explicitly — or 
implicitly — prove that they are not 
holding themselves up to the standard 
they preach. Instead, they do this to 
maintain a social media image that 
showcases passionate, high-ground 
activism. It has become “trendy” to 
be a social media activist. This needs 
to end. 

But 
the 
more 
education, 

information and awareness the better, 
regardless of the person posting it, 
right? The issue is not with the material 
itself, but rather the standard these 
social media users are promoting. 
By contradicting your own activism 
by clearly not following the action 
items you promote, you are showing 
your followers that the activism you 
are engaging with is indeed not that 
serious. It delegitimizes the work 
of real activists who put significant 
thought into their activism and then 
proceed to live a lifestyle that supports 
what they preach. 

There is a fine middle ground that 

people our age often fail to realize. 
It is not a black and white situation; 
just because an Instagram user 
does not make daily posts about 
the importance of wearing a mask 
does not mean that they are denying 
the pandemic’s severity. If you are 
someone who understands the 
severity of the pandemic but knows 
that there’s a likelihood that you will 
be in a large group setting (with a 
chance of posting it to your page), 
then you should not preach against 
large group settings. By contradicting 
your own activism, you are telling 
your followers that what you are 
preaching is only important enough 
to make stories or posts about, but not 
important enough to follow through 
in supporting. 

I understand why people in our 

generation often engage in this type 
of performative activism, and I do not 
believe these people are inherently 
bad. When social justice movements 
become prominent — especially as 
prominent as the Black Lives Matter 
movement, which may be the largest 
movement in U.S. history according 
to the New York Times — people 
begin to support the cause even if they 
were not passionate or knowledgable 
about the movement before. Some of 
these people become truly passionate 
supporters, 
while 
others 
simply 

become passionate posters on their 
social media accounts.

The latter type of activism stems 

from white guilt — people constantly 
posting information in support of the 
movement to prove to their followers 
that they, too, are passionate about 
supporting and protecting Black lives. 
It’s for mere self-validation rather than 
the intention to generate change and 
true impact. When everyone does 
this, the information shared becomes 
meaningless and fails to help the cause.

We are students at the University 

of Michigan. If we truly care about 
a cause, then we must work to do 
whatever we can to support it. As 
college students, we are capable of doing 
more to support a cause than simply 
raising awareness on social media and 
then failing to personally uphold what 
we exhort onto others. Oftentimes, we 
find ourselves under a lot of pressure 
to conform, especially in a society that 
is so interconnected. But just because 
someone else is using their social media 
platform to educate and exhort does 
not mean that you are required to do 
the same in order to be perceived as a 
good person. Keep yourself accountable 
and stay informed. Just remember to 
practice what you preach.

A

s reported by The Michigan 
Daily in January of this 
year, Witness for Peace, an 

anti-Israel hate group, has spent 
the past 16 years of Saturday 
mornings protesting outside 
Beth Israel Congregation in 
Ann Arbor. A congregant of 
the synagogue motioned to 
sue the group at the end of 
2019. On Aug. 19, 2020, the 
ruling was justified by the First 
Amendment and the lawsuit 
was dismissed by U.S. District 
Judge Victoria Roberts.

As a young Jewish adult, 

I am often confronted with 
the question of whether anti-
Israel beliefs equate to anti-
Semitism. Many of my Jewish 
peers accuse people who are 
simply critical of the Israeli 
government’s actions as being 
anti-Semitic, though in my 
mind, these aren’t equivalent. 
On the other hand, I have had 
non-Jewish 
peers 
assume 

my 
identity 
automatically 

constitutes 
support 
of 
the 

Israeli government’s actions, 
a conflation which I perceive 
as anti-Semitic. It is possible 
to defend the existence of a 
Jewish state while criticizing 
its politics and to advocate for 
Jewish people while advocating 
against the Israeli government. 
Judaism exists independently 
of 
the 
state 
of 
Israel, 
so 

legitimate disapproval of the 
Israeli government should not 
include ridicule of the Jewish 
people.

However, 
legitimate 

disapproval 
of 
Israel’s 

government does not describe 
what 
is 
expressed 
in 
the 

protests outside Beth Israel 
Congregation. According to the 
Anti-Defamation League, an 
organization that aims to “stop 
the defamation of the Jewish 
people and to secure justice and 
fair treatment to all,” criticism 
of Israel becomes anti-Semitic 
when the actions of Israel are 
attributed to the Jewish people, 
when “Israel is denied the right 

to exist as a Jewish state and 
equal member of the global 
community” or when known 
anti-Semitic “symbols, images 
or theories are used” to defend 
anti-Israel ideologies. 

Signs 
displayed 
by 
WFP 

protestors 
meet 
all 
three 

criteria, making their anti-
Israel 
protests 
undoubtedly 

anti-Semitic. 
Their 
slogans 

included 
“Resist 
Jewish 

Power” and “Jewish Power 
Corrupts,” 
implying 
that 

the 
corruption 
within 
the 

Israeli government is a direct 
result of the Jewish faith of 
government 
officials, 
even 

though Israel is not governed 
by Jewish law. Furthermore, 
these phrases allude to the 
widespread conspiracies that 
claim Jewish people have “all 
the power,” which are anti-
Semitic by nature. Another 
sign held during WFP protests 
demands that people “boycott 
Israel.” 
In 
promoting 
the 

shunning of Israel as a whole, 

WFP denies its equivalence to 
other members of the global 
community. 
Although 
it 
is 

possible to denounce Israel 
without 
being 
anti-Semitic, 

WFP does not use such tactics 
in their protests.

The WFP conducts protests 

at the same time each week, 
specifically 
during 
Jewish 

holidays, which adds to its 
blatantly anti-Semitic message. 
Since 2003, members of the 
group 
have 
stood 
outside 

Beth 
Israel 
Congregation, 

holding 
signs 
with 
anti-

Semitic language, on Saturday 
mornings, when many Jews 
come 
for 
Shabbat 
services. 

Chabad, among the largest 
Jewish religious organizations 
globally, describes Shabbat as 
“the centerpiece of Jewish life.” 
It is widely known as a day of 
rest. It is said in the Torah, 
the holy scripture in Judaism, 
that G-d created the world 
in six days and rested on the 
seventh, blessing the day and 

declaring it holy. This seventh 
day is what we now know as 
Shabbat, the Jewish Sabbath. 
The WFP intentionally protests 
outside the synagogue during 
congregants’ 
celebration 
of 

Shabbat, ultimately tarnishing 
the holiness of the day and 
denying 
congregants 
the 

opportunity to observe the 
day of rest. The fulfillment 
of traditions in the Jewish 
faith has no correlation to the 
questionable actions of the 
Israeli 
government, 
so 
the 

WFP’s interruption of one to 
protest the other is sacrilegious 
and unjustifiable.

There is no issue to be had 

with a protest of the Israeli 
government’s actions; many can 
agree that the state’s politics 
are deeply flawed. However, the 
defamation of the Jewish people 
as evidence against Israel is not 
an ethical way to approach such 
concerns. I can confirm that we, 
as a Jewish people, have not been 
asked by Israeli government 

officials for our input regarding 
their actions, so the protest of 
the Jewish people as a means 
to protest the state of Israel is 
futile. Instead of perpetuating 
debunked conspiracies about 
Jewish people while disrupting 
their religious practice, the 
WFP should lobby Michigan’s 
representatives in the United 
States Congress and encourage 
them to decrease American 
funding to Israel. Not only 
would these efforts be better 
received by the public, but they 
would also be more effective 
in bringing about the tangible 
change they wish to see.

The lawsuit against the WFP 

was dismissed, as the U.S. 
Constitution upholds freedom of 
speech in the First Amendment. 
However, it is important to 
remember that the legality of 
an action does not speak to its 
integrity or morality. It is okay

New York City
Going to elementary school 

every morning in New York 
City, I would always look out the 
train window hoping to catch 
a glimpse of something I could 
never quite forget. Painted on the 
wall about midway between the 
103 and 96 St. stops on the 1 train 
line in Manhattan, there were 
two 
vividly-depicted 
life-sized 

rats schemingly grimacing at one 
another. An assortment of wildly-
written words, profanities and 
codenames I didn’t understand 
surrounded them.

This kind of experience has 

characterized 
countless 
other 

childhoods in the city since the 
’70s. While back then street art 
was the sign of a generation, it’s 
since fully incorporated itself 
into the subconscious of children 
born in the ’90s onward. In that 
time, it’s hybridized in unforeseen 
ways in response both to its urban 
context and, increasingly so, the 
decontextualizing force of the 
internet.

For 21-year-old street artist 

August 
Quinn 
(@bozo_207), 

inspiration comes just as much 
from the toy store he grew up 
around the corner from, Kidrobot 
in Soho, as it does from the graffiti 
he grew up around.

“Whenever I would take the 

train I remember, even as a little 
kid, looking out the window and 
seeing all the tags in the tunnels,” 
Quinn said. As I replied that the 
exact same thing had happened to 
me, he said “I know, it happens to 
so many people, and it gets in your 
head. I fucking love it.”

For Quinn and so many others 

from the city, it seemed natural, 
almost a foregone conclusion, that 
he would paint. Starting a little 
over a year ago, he began setting 
out alone at night to find spots. He 
had plenty of ideas from years of 
filling sketchbooks, but this was a 
different medium entirely.

“It took me almost six months 

just to figure out how to get control 
of the drip,” he told me when I 
asked if he had trouble with the 
paint itself. Even with a better 
grasp on the medium, paranoia 
can dominate when the canvas is 
the city. No matter where you go, 
there are eyes on the street. And 
even if you can bank on passerby 
not to tell, any one of 38,000 cops 
can pull up on you while painting. 

It can be advantageous, then, 

to go out with friends. “That’s the 

difference between doing street 
art and painting in the studio is 
that street art you’re interacting 
with the world … going out and 
meeting people. It’s just more 
social,” Quinn said.

Quinn met his friend George 

when he noticed him painting one 
night during a visit to London last 
year. They painted together several 
times during the remainder of his 
stay. More recently, he met a guy 
in Vancouver who’s been tagging 
the word “work” for over ten years 
now. It’s interesting, though, that 

a Google search for “work graffiti 
Vancouver” yields no results.

Such is the transient nature of 

street art. Even the work of those 
held highest in the community — 
people like Zexor — can be almost 
entirely painted over citywide 
within weeks of its completion. 
Other artists can be to blame, but 
most of it can be put on buffing, 
a rage against street art that has 
been just as fervent an effort as the 
art itself since the ’80s.

This summer in the city, along 

with upticks in illegal fireworks 
and gun violence, graffiti also made 
a resurgence. Trends like these 
lead some conservative media 
outlets like the New York Post to 
allege a one-for-one relationship 
between graffiti and acts of violent 
crime. While graffiti does increase 
when police are distracted by other 
issues, in reality, most graffiti is 
arguably harmless posturing and 
is disconnected from other crimes 
or infractions.

Despite many wins for the 

graffiti art form, it is met by 
constant resistance in the form 
of 
institutionalized 
removal 

efforts that cost city agencies 
thousands. Not to mention that 
all the while, these artists could 
face felony charges for their work. 
I’m not saying graffiti should 
be universally legalized — there 
are other aspects of street life to 
cherish — but felony-sentencing is 
too harsh of a punishment for the 
offense, and its mass appeal should 
be accounted for in the law. As a 
kid, two rats painted on a moldy 
concrete 
wall 
illuminated 
by 

sparks from the tracks was one of 
the most poignant things I’ve ever 
seen. People like Quinn should 
be given more freedom to create 
these affecting works for the next 
generation of artists.

Detroit
Full disclosure: I am not a graffiti 

artist. I am not a street artist. In 
fact, my ability to draw or paint in 
any medium is at best mediocre. In 
my parents’ living room at home, 
they have a self-portrait hung on 
the wall that I drew when I was 
seven. The painting has earned 
a number of exclamations of 
surprise and disgust. “What is 
that??” is common, but I’ve also 
heard a “That’s horrifying,” and a 
“Why is your face melting?”

Despite 
my 
below-average 

ability to draw or paint (or spray) 
any sort of visual, I have an 
affection for graffiti. There is more 
to graffiti than an edgy image 
on an otherwise crumbling wall. 
It has the paradoxical effect of 
blending into the fabric of a city, 
yet also being something that 
draws the attention of a passerby. 
You can get as good a measure as 
any of what a city is like and what it 
means to the people in it by looking 
at its graffiti. Detroit, a city that has 
gone through so much, is a prime 
example of this, especially the 
Dequindre Cut.

The 
Dequindre 
Cut 
is 
a 

walkway on the eastside of Detroit. 
It was initially a railroad line. In 
1998, after the rail was no longer 
in use, The Cut was sold. In the 
years of abandonment between its 
use as a walkway and its use as a 
railroad, graffiti artists flocked to 
The Cut; it was turned into an oasis 
of creativity. When the walkway 
was commissioned in 2003, it was 
decided that the murals would stay 
up, and to this day The Cut is filled 
head to toe with graffiti that has 
only grown in the years since its 
redevelopment.

THE B-SIDE: CITIES
On the value of graffiti

Has 2020 country music 
all moved into the city?

Such is the 

transient nature 

of street art. 
Even the work 
of those held 
highest in the 
community...
can be almost 
entirely painted 
over citywide 
within weeks of 
its completion

Unlike the clear geographical 

divides that segregate the rich and 
the poor in most American cities, 
London is a city where “council 
tower blocks (roughly, housing 
projects) are mingled in with the 
multimillion-pound 
mansions,” 

writes Dan Hancox in “Inner City 
Pressure: The Story of Grime.” 
In the center of the city lie its 
central business districts: the City 
of London and Canary Wharf, 
symbols of extreme privatized 
wealth and decadence, not unlike 
similar projects undertaken in 
New York City and other world 
cities in which high finance has 
taken over. Just a few miles away lie 
“the boroughs of Hackney, Tower 
Hamlets and Newham,” arguably 
the creative centers of the book’s 
eponymous genre, grime. Notably, 
these boroughs also constitute 
some of the “most deprived local 
authorities in the entire country.”

Despite the interconnectedness 

of the city that Hancox describes, 
even 
those 
only 
somewhat 

familiar with London’s history 
might recognize the position of 
East London in comparison with 
the rest of the city. From “Mary 
Poppins” to “West End Girls,” East 
London has always been seen as the 
more deprived area of the greater 
metro area, with a large working-
class population, and recently, 
an especially large immigrant 
working class population. After 
widespread 
changes 
in 
the 

shipping industry decimated the 
London docklands, then-Prime 
Minister 
Margaret 
Thatcher 

ushered in a new age of capitalism, 
one in which developers and the 
financial sector could retake the 
abandoned docklands under an 
environment of “no questions 
asked” deregulation, all with public 
financial support. This sealed 
off what is now Canary Wharf 
from 
the 
“disproportionately 

sick, 
unhappy, 
overcrowded, 

addicted, jobless and impoverished 
neighbours.” Grime MCs such 
as Dizzee Rascal note how when 
growing up, the skyscrapers of the 
new financialized London were 
ever-visible and ever-present as 
a reminder of the city they were 
never a part of, their own green 
light in the harbor.

On the other side of the Atlantic, 

similar events played out in the 
1970s and ’80s, the era when post-
New Deal America crumbled 
and when the foundations of 
Reaganism, 
Clintonism 
and 

everything beyond rose from its 
ashes. In “Black Noise,” Tricia 
Rose explains that by the middle 
of the 1970s, New York City was 
“virtually bankrupt and in a 
critical state of disrepair” after the 
refusal of the federal government 
to provide any more public funds, 
as well as widespread changes in 
America’s economy. In response, 
city officials negotiated a federal 
loan which was to be accompanied 
with crushing austerity measures 
such as the removal of federal jobs. 
According to Rose, these conditions 
had an outsized impact on Black 
and Hispanic communities in the 
city, with homes being destroyed 
by the hundreds of thousands to 
facilitate city planning projects 
designed not to support the city’s 
most vulnerable, but rather to 
attract wealthier, whiter, more 
technocratic new residents. This 
had the effect of shifting large 
Black and Hispanic populations 
from all over the city into the South 
Bronx: a cultural mélange where 
native New Yorkers, immigrants 
from Africa and the Caribbean and 
a crushing environment of poverty 
and desperation all gave rise to the 
genre of hip-hop.

These 
days, 
geographical 

boundaries are almost obsolete 
in delineating musical genres. 
A teenage boy in Sweden can 
make hip-hop that recalls the 
washed-out sounds of Houston, 
a Californian can make Jersey 
Club and a Nigerian can make 
shoegaze without a blink of the 
eye. Labels such as Artetetra can 
set up shop in Bologna, yet sign 
artists from Moscow to make 
extremely cosmopolitan pop. Not 
to say that this couldn’t or didn’t 
happen before the advent of mp3s 
and SoundCloud. After all, we did 
see rock take an impressive hold in 
some countries in South America 
as well as the migration of jazz to 
Africa and East Asia. However, 
this process often unfolded over 
much longer time periods than 

today. Traditionally, supporting 
a burgeoning scene takes work. 
It would require the cooperation 
and enterprising spirit of label 
managers, record shop owners, 
A&R 
personnel, 
promoters, 

concert hall owners and of course, 
the musicians themselves. Due 
to this, the development of these 
“scenes” more often than not took 
place in cities.

Allan Watson, a professor at 

Loughborough University who 
studies the interaction between 
geography 
and 
music, 
wrote 

that “The local infrastructure of 
production, including recording 
studios and live music venue, 
helps to solidify diverse musical 
scenes in space, through the ways 
in which musicians, audiences, 
and music industry professionals 
make use of the infrastructure.” 
He further noted that “Even at 
their most intimate moments 
of birth, creative moments and 
episodes connect with concrete 
social conditions. Therefore, it is 
important to give attention to the 
social and physical environments 
in which creativity happens,” and 
that cities, especially in certain 
“bohemian” quarters inside them, 
facilitate these social connections 
and 
develop 
the 
professional 

networks that beget the rise of 
scenes.

In isolation, none of this 

information 
is 
particularly 

insightful. 
In 
a 
sense, 
this 

phenomenon applies to many 
sectors of the arts and other 
endeavors. Cities host networks of 
successful individuals and attract 
those who want to share part of that 
success. However, it is important 
to note that music is one of the 
arts that is (or at least historically 
has been) the most dependent on 
some form of collective experience 
and enjoyment. Musicians of all 
levels of popularity have depended 
on 
live 
performances 
and 

merchandise sales that come along 
with them to make up the majority 
of their income. Moreover, it is 
undeniable that the city’s material 
conditions, geography and history 
all shape the sounds of the music 
that comes from it. While it may 
be overzealous to claim genre A or 
B could not be created anywhere 
other than the place that it came 
from, perhaps such a claim is not 
too far from the truth. It also begs 
the question: How much of this is 
relevant anymore? In the age of 
Spotify, SoundCloud, TikTok, etc., 
how much do local scenes matter 
in the development of a sound or 
new genre? Does this get rid of an 
intrinsic part of music culture or 
does it break down barriers and 
create new revolutionary methods 
of creative ideation?

Returning 
to 
London 
in 

particular, 
how 
do 
these 

geographical 
factors 
affect 

the sound of grime? Hancox 
suggested one element of its 
sound is a form of Afrofuturism: 
“The African diasporic aesthetic 
that takes science fiction as a tool 
for discussing oppression and 
freedom–where spaceships might 
be a metaphor for slave ships, 
subverting the journey to make 
it one of escape, not damnation.” 
These ideas are prevalent in 
grime’s instrumentals. Hancox 
argued that this could all be traced 
back to the gleaming skyline of 
Canary Wharf, constantly visible 
from some of the poorest, most 
forgotten council flats in the city, 
where refugees and immigrants 
from some of the poorest countries 
in the world could see the symbols 
of 21st century London as both a 
menace and a sort of inspiration. 
The philosophy that places like 
Canary Wharf represent is that of 
“privately owned public spaces: 
where security guards can ask you 
to leave just based on looking at 
you,” writes Hancox.

On the lyrical side of grime, 

it is impossible to escape the 
overwhelming 
influence 
of 

Jamaican reggae culture and 
music. Jamaican, and West Indian 
immigrants in general, have a long 
history in London. Notably, it in 
part stems from a 1948 journey 
by the HMT Empire Windrush 
which brought hundreds to begin 
their lives in the city, mainly to 
work as laborers. When Jamaican 
immigrants first arrive, many live 
in the very council flats which later 
become host to the pirate radio 
shows and bootleg production 
studios giving rise to iconic British 
genres such as jungle, garage, 
dubstep and grime. Per Hancox, 
“It’s not just a family connection, 
or an abstract component of the 

musical bloodline: grime echoes 
its Jamaican reggae heritage in its 
structure, in its tropes, in its slang, 
in the way it’s performed, and 
stylistically: particularly harking 
back to the ‘fast chat’ reggae style 
of the likes of Smiley Culture.” 
Even more so than the music itself, 
grime borrows from this heritage 
through the likes of its methods 
of distribution as well as the 
structure of its live performances.

In New York City in the 

1970s and ’80s, in the midst 
of its transformation into the 
center of global commerce (what 
economist Yanis Varoufakis dubs 
the “Minotaur”), a similar set of 
events played out, producing one 
of modern music’s most globally 
dominant genres. Like grime, hip-
hop owes much of its early sounds 
to Jamaican immigrants and the 
music culture they imported. 
According to Rose, one of the most 
important figures in early hip-
hop history was a Jamaican man 
named DJ Kool Herc, who helped 
import Jamaica’s sound-system 
culture, which involved playing 
music out of impressively large 
towers of speakers and a whole 
range of activities surrounding 
them. In particular, Kool Herc 
was known for “his practice of 
extending obscure instrumental 
breaks that created an endless 
collage of peak dance beats named 
b-beats or break-beats,” writes 
Rose, with sources ranging from 
Isaac Hayes to European groups 
like 
Kraftwerk. 
Rival 
crews 

established 
their 
own 
sound 

systems and competed for territory 
and 
attention, 
simultaneously 

developing 
innovative 
DJing 

techniques such as backspinning 
to create complex new collages 
of music from different samples. 
Around the same time, MCs and 
rappers started coming into play, 
at first as a way to keep the crowd 
focused on the center stage. Hip-
hop culture in general resulted as a 
combination of these West Indian 
influences, and its interaction with 
the culture of the South Bronx and 
surrounding areas. From the very 
beginning, Black and Hispanic 
women and men developed the 
arts of graffiti and breakdancing 
alongside rapping and beatmaking.

Looking back at these decades, 

it is remarkable to note the 
proliferation of new genres and 
styles popping up by the month. 
But these movements weren’t only 
occurring in the megalopolises of 
the two countries we’re focusing 
on. In the interiors of the countries, 
less “glamorous” cities such as 
Detroit, Cleveland, Manchester 
and Sheffield were also hotspots 
of musical creativity. In a suburb 
of Detroit called Belleville, three 
Black 
teenagers 
found 
each 

other in their mostly white town. 
Through their love of a wide 
range of music from Parliament-
Funkadelic to Kraftwerk and 
Yellow Magic Orchestra, they 
created what is now known all over 
as Detroit techno. The “Belleville 
Three:” Juan Atkins, Derrick 
May 
and 
Kevin 
Saunderson 

“belonged to a new generation 
of Detroit-area black youth who 
grew up accustomed to affluence, 
thanks in part to the racially 
integrated United Auto Workers 
union,” wrote Simon Reynolds 
in Generation Ecstasy: Into the 
World of Techno and Rave Culture. 
According to Reynolds, their tastes 
were also influenced by WGPR 
radio DJ Charles Johnson, who 
would spin “Kraftwerk’s ‘Tour de 
France’ and other electro-pop” 
alongside American artists such as 
Prince. The music they developed 
through constant experimentation 
spinning records and working with 
drum machines and synthesizers 
combined the funkiness of their 
influences Parliament-Funkadelic 
with 
the 
cold, 
programmed 

rhythms of the oft-mentioned 
Kraftwerk. Like grime, this new 
genre they developed was future-
looking from day one. Later artists 
such as the legendary Detroit 
duo Drexciya developed a whole 
Afrofuturist mythology around 
their nautical electro. Per Reynolds, 
“But for all their futuristic mise-
en-scène, the vision underlying 
Cybotron (Atkins’s original group) 
was Detroit-specific, capturing a 
city in transition: from industrial 
boomtown 
to 
post-Fordist 

wasteland, from US capital of auto 
manufacturing to US capital of 
homicide.”

“God’s 
Country,” 
“How 

Country Feels” and more recently 
“UNAPOLOGETICALLY 
COUNTRY AS HELL” are but a 
few examples of country music’s 
allegiance to its bucolic namesake. 
Not to mention the scores of songs 
about small towns, dirt roads and 
that one spot by the river no one 
else knows about. Sometimes, this 
devotion can turn hostile. Jason 
Aldean disparages the “guys in 
first class” who don’t appreciate 
the heartland in “Fly Over States.” 
Luke Bryan shakes his head at the 
unknowing city weatherman on 
“Rain is a Good Thing.”

But just how “country” is 

mainstream country music in 
2020? Jason Aldean, for example, 
is probably riding first class 
himself. What does Luke Bryan 
care if it rains or not? He’s not a 
farmer. Additionally, for some, 
contemporary 
country 
music’s 

glossy 
production 
and 
heavy 

pop 
and 
hip-hop 
influences 

have rendered its rural roots 
unrecognizable, roots that several 
stars no longer make an effort 
to even nod to when they brand 
themselves. As of late, many plaid 
shirts and cowboy boots have 
been ditched for crisp, firm-fitting 
T-shirts and sneakers.

Nothing better encapsulates the 

country-turned-city trend than 
Thomas Rhett’s career. When he 

first found success in 2012, he was 
scruffy. Adorned in jeans and a 
baseball cap and armed with an 
acoustic guitar, his image and sound 
were firmly planted in the fields 
of his bro-country predecessors. 
By 2015 though, Rhett was better 
groomed and more style savvy and 
popular than ever. Hit songs like 
“Crash and Burn” and “T-Shirt” 
found Rhett sonically uprooted and 
crafting a style reliant on infectious, 
dance-ready drums, synths and 
clean-cut lyrics while leaving the 
thought of fiddles, steel guitar or 
corn fields behind him.

Despite Rhett’s success in the 

city, tons of country songs continue 
to belittle it — often in a way 
that’s gendered. Sometimes, the 
sentiment manifests in little digs. 
In “Singles You Up,” Jordan Davis is 
flirting with a girl who’s taken and 
taunts “does he want you to be just 
a little more city?” But other times, 
moving to the city as something 
unconscionable, even for love, is the 
premise of the song itself. Morgan 
Wallen gushes about a girl on 
“More Than My Hometown” but 
ultimately has to wish her well. He 
loves her, but not enough to follow 
her and her dreams away from 
home.

As strange as it might seem, this 

country/city dichotomy narrows 
how women are able to participate 
in country music. Not only are 
women most often portrayed as 
the ones who want to leave the 
small town, which is decidedly 

uncountry of them, but they also 
face the universal pressure to have 
a more glamorous image than 
their male counterparts. Luke 
Combs will wear a tee and jeans, 
but that isn’t considered acceptable 
stage attire for artists like Carrie 
Underwood. This kind of double 
standard expands into how artists’ 
songs are judged sonically as well. 
Rhett hasn’t attracted nearly as 
much pushback based on the sound 
of his music as Maren Morris or 
Kelsea Ballerini for their similarly 
pop-inspired work and branding.

Ultimately, 
worrying 
about 

where the genre’s heart resides is 
pointless. Country music never 
left where it came from — the 
city, that is. With beginnings in 
Atlanta, Nashville and Chicago, 
even the genre’s earliest recordings 
are not entirely “country.” And 
with 
a 
long, 
well-established 

history in Nashville, neither was 
its in-between. Even the images 
we associate with country music 
have somewhat urbane origins. 
Country singers used to get dressed 
up in their finest clothes to play 
on country radio. That is, until the 
city-based radio executives thought 
that having the musicians dress 
up like farmers would sell their 
music better. Whether one likes it 
or not, country music, in its many 
evolutions, has thrived in part 
because of the city, not in spite of it.

THE B-SIDE: CITIES
Why setting is so important in film

When I tell people around here that I’m from 

Seattle, we often end up talking about one of the 
following: Microsoft or Amazon (or people they 
know that work there), rain or “Grey’s Anatomy.” 
No one seems to know anything about Seattle 
beyond the basics. And over time, as I’ve watched 
films that are set in Seattle, it feels the same — 
like no one really knows what they’re talking 
about. It never feels quite right, no matter how 
many Seattle sports references or aerial shots of 
the skyline they include.

I’ve never understood why anyone wouldn’t 

want to use Seattle as a setting — Are the trees too 
green? Is the water too blue? Are the mountains 
too beautiful? — but the reality is that, compared 
to cities like New York, Chicago and L.A., there 
are few mainstream films set in Seattle. Most of 
them didn’t start getting made until the 1990s, 
when grunge and Nirvana got the rest of the 
country’s attention and people started to realize 
that Seattle is a pretty cool place. Still, they’re 
often not quite right. We’re happy to claim these 
movies — “Sleepless in Seattle,” “10 Things I 
Hate About You,” “Say Anything” and more — 
but it’s also difficult not to notice, at the same 
time, when a city layout that you know intimately 
is being shifted for the film’s purposes.

Setting is crucial in film. It establishes 

essential character traits, external and internal 
alike. But with many films, including many of 
the Seattle-based films I’ve seen, it feels like 
the writers picked the film’s location out of a 
hat. They pepper in major tourist landmarks 
and design their costumes for the area’s general 
climate, but the story could really be anywhere. 
For Seattle-based films, this means establishing 
location by showing a few of the landmarks 
that people actually know: the Space Needle, 
Pike Place Market, the Washington State 
ferries, the Space Needle again, the stadiums 
and skyscrapers downtown, the Puget Sound 
waterfront and the Space Needle one more time 
for good measure.

To be fair, there are complications to filming 

in Seattle proper: It can be difficult and very 
expensive, which is why many Seattle movies 
opt to film in California or Vancouver, BC 
instead. Still, it feels lazy. The unfortunate thing 
is that people don’t usually notice the difference; 
anyone who isn’t from the area has no way of 
knowing that those two neighborhoods aren’t 
anywhere near each other, or that the weather is 
way too nice for May in Seattle. 

There are a few exceptions to this: “Sleepless 

in Seattle,” for example. Seattle natives love 
“Sleepless” for the most part — it’s one of the few 
Seattle-based movies that are actually filmed 
in the city, and its use of a houseboat means 
that the film is filled with lovely images of Lake 
Union and downtown. Another is “10 Things I 

Hate About You,” which prominently features 
places like Kerry Park, Gas Works Park and the 
Fremont Troll — places that Seattle natives know 
very well even if outsiders might not recognize 
them.

But these films aren’t perfect either. A good 

chunk of “10 Things” is actually filmed in Tacoma 
(a city just south of Seattle, about twice the size 
of Ann Arbor), and some of what’s filmed on site 
is actually compilations of multiple locations. 
Not to mention the notoriously inaccurate scene 
in “Sleepless” where Tom Hanks’s character and 
his son inexplicably take a rowboat from Lake 
Union to Alki Beach while Meg Ryan’s character 
follows them in her car — a geographically 
impossible scenario, especially in the short 
amount of time that it appears to take. This scene, 
and its blatant disregard for the city’s geographic 
reality, has been mocked by Seattleites for almost 
three decades.

Part of the disconnect stems from the fact 

that these filmmakers are rarely from the area 
at all. They don’t have the same respect for the 
city’s structure and layout; to them, it’s just a 
place where their movie is set rather than a city 
that has been in existence for 150 years. For 
example, Cameron Crowe made the choice in 
“Say Anything” to illogically place a “Welcome 
to Seattle” sign on the Lakeview Boulevard 
overpass — a bridge right in the middle of the 
city, far from city limits. In his mind, he could do 
that — clearly, he saw the city as a world whose 
reality he could shape for his own purposes.

The reality is that people don’t know enough 

about Seattle as a city to appreciate it. Most 
people I talk to think that rain in Seattle is 
like most other places in the US: torrential 
downpours and thunderstorms. It isn’t. Anyone 
who has lived in the Seattle area knows that 
Seattle rain is common, but gentle. And in the 17+ 
years that I’ve lived there, I’ve only witnessed 
one 
thunderstorm. 
It’s 
a 
strange 
double 

standard: people who aren’t from New York or 

L.A. somehow seem to know enough about it 
to carry on a conversation with someone who’s 
from there. Yet when I mention Seattle I get 
those same responses: Microsoft, Amazon, rain, 
“Grey’s Anatomy.”

The ways that film and place are intertwined 

warrants more attention and precision. In an 
ideal world, the city where a film is set should be 
seen as a place that the story molds to fit, rather 
than the opposite. Other films about other cities 
use it as a setting that is so inextricable from the 
story and the characters that it becomes like its 
own character. And yet films about Seattle, and 
other cities that are discussed less often, are not 
given the same treatment.

If you’ve never lived in Seattle, or even been 

there, these films probably won’t make much 
difference to you either way. But to me, it’s a 
reflection of the places that I’ve known for most 
of my life. You might see an image of the Space 
Needle; I see going to Seattle Center with my 
family, or the summer I spent working at the 
Pacific Science Center. You see the Pike Place 
Market sign; I see first-grade field trips, or forays 
into the city with my friends. You see an iconic 
green-and-white ferry; I see trips to Bainbridge 
Island to visit my aunt. You see a highway with 
the Seattle skyline above it; I see I-5 North, 
where I’ve driven and been driven hundreds of 
times. Any images of Seattle in films are going to 
be arbitrary, because you don’t know my city the 
way that I do, just as I don’t know yours.

But I think the tides are starting to change. 

People are paying more attention to Seattle — I’ve 
had a number of people mention that they would 
love to live there if given the chance. Hopefully 
soon I’ll get to see more films that show Seattle 
the way I know it, beyond that one stock image 
of the Space Needle rising over the waterfront. 
Maybe then, when I mention where I’m from, 
people will have more to say.

Hyphenated:

‘Bulge 
Bracket’

DAILY A/PIA ARTS COLUMN

The slang term “Bulge Bracket” generally refers to 

the largest multinational investment banks. As of July 
2020, “Bulge Bracket” additionally refers to a TVshow 
produced by Christopher Au. 

Despite its unfortunate name, “Bulge Bracket” 

introduces a relatable Asian American protagonist 
and rejects soapy genre mainstays. Unlike other 
high-stress high-drama workplace shows like “The 
Good Wife” and “Suits,” “Bulge Bracket” doesn’t 
aspire to be sexy or soapy. Sans steamy workplace 
romances, Au develops his show around stress and 
professional hurdles. By cleaving so close to reality, the 
independently produced show depicts a frighteningly 
familiar corporate grind.

Au delves into professional stresses through the 

lens of novice banker Cathy (Jessika Van, “Awkward”). 
She faces capricious bosses, frat-bro work culture and 
unhelpful HR departments. 

Though Cathy happens to be Asian, Au treats 

her as a regular character. Au acknowledges her 
Asian American-ness but thankfully dodges the 
overwhelming urge some TV producers feel to harp 
on and problematize an Asian American character’s 
ethnicity. Instead, Cathy is first and foremost a woman 
operating within a very white, institutionalized 
space. In the show, Cathy’s primary concern is not 
her Asian-ness. Rather, it’s whether sacrificing her 
health, relationships and wellbeing is worth uncertain 
professional success. 

But while not making it the center of his character 

narrative, Au does not skimp on excellent Asian 
American commentary. Through different APIA 
(Asian and Pacific Islander American) characters, Au 
shows that Asian-American-ness is an ethnic umbrella 
term and not a personality trait. Emphatically: Not all 
Asians are the same.

In one fantastic exchange, Cathy asks her co-workers 

where she should rent a hotel for her parents. Danny 
(Chris King Wong, “Better Call Saul”) her underling 
analyst quips, “What kind of Asian are you?” noting 
that his parents always stay in his tiny apartment when 
they visit. On screen, Cathy shruggs and awkwardly 
explains that she lives with her boyfriend, a statement 
that makes Danny raise his eyebrows. 

In this exchange, “Bulge Bracket” ribs at a 

mythologized monolithic Asian American. Not all 
Asians are the same and there is no “correct” way of 
being Asian American. To quote a dear friend of mine, 
“For just as many Asian Americans that there are, there 
are just as many valid ways of being Asian American.” 

By virtue of having more than one Asian American 

character, Au is able weave in these illuminating 
scenarios without being heavy-handed. In that same 
fantastic exchange, Danny personally identified 
frugality and modesty as Asian traits, yet Cathy, also 
Asian American, does not identify with his definition.

“Bolo” (Feodor Chin, “Big Little Lies”) is another 

character Au uses to combat Asian American 
stereotypes. Cathy’s boss is loud, capricious and 
hyper-masculine. He plays golf with the other high-
level executives, having broken through the bamboo 
ceiling. But his success belies the things he sacrificed 
to become a top-level banker.

In the denouement, however, Bolo reveals a more 

serious side to his character. He discloses to Cathy 
that his name is actually John and that a racist 
coworker nicknamed him “Bolo” during his first year 
as an analyst grunt. Like Cathy, Bolo suffered racist 
microaggressions and weathered mercurial bosses. In 
the end, he tells Cathy that if she sticks with the firm, 
he will make sure she gets good, career-building cases. 

Finally! Someone on the show recognized the 

existence of racism and articulated it! For the entirety 
of the first season, the firm’s pervasive Culture of 
Silence stymied any genuine in-world discourse. Still, 
Bolo’s cathartic revelation leaves a bitter aftertaste. 
Only Bolo’s privilege as an executive-level banker 
allows him to put a word to the crime. His ability to 
articulate reality comes from a place of privilege. 

In the world of “Bulge Bracket,” without powerful 

industry connections, a single misstep can cause 
professional 
ruin. 
Having 
conversations 
about 

race and discrimination are unproductive for most 
employees; HR is unresponsive and bank superiors are 
unsympathetic. Corporate does not valorize honesty. 
The “Bulge Bracket” unequivocally demands personal 
sacrifice and conformity. 

At the end of the day, I hesitate to label the show’s 

corporate environment as hellish. The show is based 
off of Au’s wife Cindy’s own two-year stint in the 
bulge bracket. The world Au depicts is firmly rooted 
in an earthly reality. There’s a notable lack of elicit file 
cabinet rendezvous. Instead, the show depicts un-sexy 
sexual harassment and a young capable employee 
being ground into the dirt by stress. “Bulge Bracket” 
digs into corporate politics and presents the corporate 
workplace for what it is: absurd, montonimous and 
stressful. 

I was incredibly pleased by this unassuming show. I 

feasted well on “Bulge Bracket,” temporarily satiating 
my desire for good television and unmatched Asian 
American representation. 

***
For this food rec, I struggled to think of something 

mobile for stressed corporate clogs. My ultimate 
response is a Panera Bread poppy-seed bagel with plain 
cream cheese. 

However, in honor of my banker aunt, I am 

additionally recommending a side of lox and a generous 
sprinkle of capers. My addendums are a little more 
luxurious than a 100+ hour work week would permit 
but I am an advocate for treating oneself.

THE B-SIDE: CITIES
The endless TV shows about NYC

There is no shortage of television that 

takes place in New York City. I truly believe 
there should be an Emmy category titled 
“Outstanding Series Based in NYC.” It’s 
almost maddening when you think about it. 
Do the universes overlap? Has Jerry Seinfeld 
ordered coffee from Central Perk? Do Olivia 
Benson and Captain Holt occasionally pass 
by each other at NYPD events? Did Barney 
Stinson ever try something weird with 
Samantha Jones? The streets of the Big Apple 
are overrun with characters from iconic 
shows, so much so that the city itself has 
become one of television’s most prolific stars. 

It’s hard for me to not dedicate this 

piece to “The Nanny” or “Everybody Hates 
Chris” — the TV seeds of my childhood that 
turned into full-blown obsession — but as 
important to New York television culture 
as those series are, they’ll have to wait their 
turn. There are two shows whose existences 
define NYC television, driving tourists to 
West Village street corners and Morningside 
Heights diners. Yes, I’m talking about the 
two homogenous friend group-based sitcoms 
we love to hate or hate to love: “Friends” and 
“Seinfeld.” 

“Friends” and “Seinfeld” are the New 

York City sitcoms. I will actively ignore the 
existence of “How I Met Your Mother” for 
two main reasons: 1) Three out of the five 
main characters are Midwestern/Canadian 
transplants and 2) that damn finale. People 
may be angry that I’m putting “Friends” 
and “Seinfeld” in the same article, let alone 
sentence, but at the bare minimum, they are 
both about a friend group navigating life 
in the big city, and they were both actually 
filmed in California. With that being said, 
I do agree the two shows are incredibly 
different, primarily in the way New York City 
itself plays a role. 

I’ve said it before and I will say it again: 

“Friends” could’ve taken place in any city 
and still have been the same show. What was 
uniquely New York about it? The characters 
largely interacted with only each other, 
and ventured nowhere in the city beyond a 
nonexistent coffee shop and the occasional 
theater. Joey could have been a struggling 
actor in LA, Rachel could’ve worked at the 

Chicago Bloomingdales, Monica could be a 
chef in a Miami restaurant — the storylines 
would barely change. “Friends” couldn’t 
even bother to get NYC geography right. 
The characters often mention coming from 
or walking through Central Park, and in 

one episode Phoebe says her apartment is 
down the block from the park. Yet all of 
their apartments are in the West Village, 
specifically around Grove and Bedford, 
which is over 50 blocks from Central Park. 
And you rarely see them on a subway. It’s 
madness. 

The character potential of New York City 

is wasted in “Friends,” but “Seinfeld” has no 

such problem. From the Soup Nazi to George 
Steinbrenner, Mr. Pitt to David Puddy, 
“Seinfeld” utilizes the lawless good of the 
city that never sleeps. Even the main group 
itself is a personification of the city; chaotic 
adults who view life with a nonchalance and 
indifference that would be infuriating if it 
wasn’t so entertaining. Nearly every episode 
in this show-about-nothing provides a look 
into the zany tedium of city life. A bottle 
episode taking place in the waiting area of 
a Chinese restaurant. Fighting for chocolate 
babka in a crowded bakery. Failing to get 
sleep against the neon red glow of a chicken 
roaster sign across the street. These stories, 
and every odd character thrown into them, 
don’t try to stifle the absurdity of New York. 
They embrace it. 

It’s an easy choice to place a show in New 

York. The city makes for an easy and familiar 
backdrop, with enough murder to make for a 
good crime show and enough elites for a good 
schoolgirl drama. But any show not taking 
full advantage of the setting is wasting the 
city, tossing aside plotlines and characters 
that are essentially written for them on every 
subway ride and bodega run. Just leave it to 
the king of observations, Mr. Jerry Seinfeld, 
to explain it: “All people in New York are 
funny and get funnier as they get older, and 
everyone outside New York gets less funny.”

Wednesday, September 16, 2020 — 13 

I saw ‘Tenet’ in theaters. 
Here’s why you shouldn’t.

Content warning: gun violence.
They say not to yell “fire” in a 

crowded movie theater. Why?

Are we so gullible that anyone 

who hears the forbidden word will 
throw their popcorn and sprint 
down the aisles like a re-showing 
of “Cats” has just begun?

I don’t buy it. People aren’t 

that easy to scare. How many of 
us have grown up having class 
interrupted by fire, tornado and 
lockdown sirens, and barely batted 
our eyes as we walked outside, hid 
under tables, barricaded doors or 
grabbed classroom items to use 
against a shooter?

It’s something about the movie 

theater, specifically.

We’re used to bullets flying 

through classrooms like spitballs, 
just like we’re used to sitting 
on airplanes, and wondering if 
maybe, just maybe, it’ll happen 
again. These spaces have been 
under attack for decades — from 
hijackings in the ’70s to 9/11, from 
Columbine to Newtown. However 
traumatized, we’ve learned to live 
with these threats, and American 
culture has warped around them.

But movie theaters were safe. 

With a sip of soda, a bite of popcorn 
and the hum of a projector, we 
could fall into a story and leave 
the real world and its real terrors 
behind. We could lean back in 
those red seats, stretch out our legs 
and feel safe opposite the silver 
screen.

I’ve been wondering, lately, if 

that was what people did in Aurora 
before their midnight showing of 
“The Dark Knight Rises” on July 
20, 2012. It was a sold out show on 
opening night, full of kids, tweens, 
teens and adults ready to see the 
most anticipated movie of the 
year. I wonder what the pre-show 
bustle sounded like. The shuffling 
of seats as someone with an armful 
of wrinkling Twizzlers passed fans 
debating whether Batman would 
survive Bane, or if Hathaway’s 
Catwoman would be any good.

The excitement of a blockbuster, 

a real tentpole event of a film, is 
infectious no matter who you are. 
I can feel their excitement as the 
movie began, because I’ve felt it 
myself, year after year, through 
blockbusters 
good 
and 
bad, 

memorable and disposable. But, 
that night in July 2012, around 
the point where an injured Bruce 
Wayne finally returns as Batman 

for a police chase, a door next to 
the screen opened. A man walked 
into the theater, and started 
shooting.

Movie theaters didn’t feel safe 

anymore.

Maybe it’s just me. Maybe I’ve 

given arbitrary value to some 
walls, a giant piece of plastic, 
strips of celluloid and a concession 
stand. That might be true, because 
the movies have always been a 
deeply personal comfort. When 
I first found out I was gay, or, 
more accurately, admitted it to 
myself, one of the first things I 
did was go and see “The Hobbit: 
An Unexpected Journey.” Not a 
perfect movie, but a perfect escape.

Immersed in Middle Earth for 

those two and a half hours, I didn’t 
think about what it would be like 
going through life differently 
from my friends and family, in a 
place where (at the time) I couldn’t 
legally marry, and where (in my 
state) it was still legal to deny me 
service or the adoption of a child 
because of my sexual orientation. 
For those two and a half hours, I 
just thought about a particularly 
officious Hobbit, some obnoxious 
dwarves and a familiar wizard. 

Still, this was mere months after 

Aurora. Before the lights went out 
and I chowed down on buttery 
popcorn, I checked the exits and 
made a plan, just in case. I’ve done 
that at the movies ever since. The 
theater, while still offering escape 
beneath the flickering beams of a 
projector, had become somewhere 
to look over my shoulder every 
once in a while. It wasn’t too scary, 
because I’d gotten used to it. For 
the most part, so did everyone else. 
Like with schools and airplanes, 
American culture warped around 
the threat to movie theaters, and 
soldiered on.

Despite the subliminal fear, my 

imagination remained wide open. 
I accepted whatever appeared on 
the screen, even a CGI creature 
named Smeagol, as emotional 
fact. By doing so, though, wasn’t I 
making myself vulnerable? Is that 
why someone can’t yell “fire” in a 
movie theater, because everyone, 
their disbelief suspended, would 
believe them?

***
That was my attempt to explain 

why I drove almost 100 miles and 
donned a face shield, N95 mask, 
gloves and plastic poncho to see 
“Tenet” in a movie theatre.

The state government has 

shuttered cinemas across most 
of Michigan since March. For 

good reason, too. Yet part of me 
thought that, as a movie critic, I 
needed to capture what going to 
the movies looked and felt like 
during the coronavirus pandemic. 
More honestly, I was scared. I have 
been, constantly, since March. 
Throughout my life, whenever 
things have scared me, I have seen 
a movie. After the past six months, 
I desperately craved the escape 
that only the cinema gave me.

“Tenet,” 
directed 
by 

Christopher Nolan (“Dunkirk”) 
and 
starring 
John 
David 

Washington (“BlacKkKlansman”) 
and 
Robert 
Pattinson 
(“The 

Lighthouse”), has been the most 
anticipated film of 2020. The 
teasers promised a mind-bending 
thriller that would take my mind 
off the virus, November’s election 
and 
the 
University’s 
terrible 

reopening 
plans. 
It 
seemed 

perfect.

When I entered the Findley 

AMC 12, the lobby was empty. 
Caution tape hung limp over arcade 
machines that once flashed bright 
red and yellow. The concession 
stand was barren, blocked off by 
towering plastic spit shields on 
the counter. Two people in masks 
and gloves took my ticket, and 
pointed me to my theater. It wasn’t 
any better. Large swaths of the 
empty, opening night auditorium 
were roped off by yellow caution 
tape, like something terrible had 
already happened.

When I sat down, I looked for 

the exits and made a plan, just 
in case. The ads dazzled against 
my face shield. Smiling M&M’S 
appeared, and said something like 
“We’re so glad you’re back! Thank 
you!”

Just as they said this, two 

people entered the theater and 
sat on the opposite end of my row. 
They promptly removed their 
masks, and one of them, I kid you 
not, coughed into their popcorn. 
My poncho crinkled against the 
seat when I shivered. 

Then 
the 
previews 
began: 

“007: No Time To Die,” “Wonder 
Woman 1984,” “Murder on the 
Nile” and “Dune.” While these 
trailers normally would’ve been 
exciting, especially that last one, it 
was hard to focus on the screen. It 
wasn’t just because my glasses kept 
fogging up behind my face shield; 
I had already decided that, until a 
vaccine was widely distributed, I 
was never doing this again.

The magic of the cinema was 

choked to death by the yards 
of caution tape and the smell 

of cleaning fluid that radiated 
from the tile beneath my feet. 
Its replacement was a constant, 
piercing anxiety. My imagination 
could withstand the threat of a 
mass shooting (I’m American, 
after all), but COVID-19 has stolen 
everything 
that 
made 
movie 

theaters so warm.

The 
other 
people 
in 
the 

audience, not to mention the 
smorgasbord of snacks, are both 
invitations to the virus. Even 
breathing feels dangerous. Seeing a 
movie in September 2020 feels like 
watching a film while the theater 
burns down around you. It was 
nearly impossible to suspend my 
disbelief and use my imagination, 
because it was already totally 
occupied thinking about all the 
horrors, microbial, economic and 
political, that the starkly different 
theaters implied.

Still, as “Tenet” began, I had 

hope. This was 2020’s “The 
Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey.’” 
I could leap into one of Christopher 
Nolan’s finely-crafted, riveting 
dreamscapes. I could, finally, 
forget the world for a few hours in 
the darkness of a movie theater.

Boy, was I wrong.
***
There’s a great movie buried 

deep within “Tenet.” But it would 
take a team of skilled special 
agents, much like those in the 
film, to remove it without being 
pulverized by the movie’s sheer 
excesses.

“Tenet” begins with a pulse-

pounding scene that rivals even 
the bank heist opening of “The 
Dark Knight.” One isn’t entirely 
sure what is going on, but it doesn’t 
matter because the action is so 
riveting, propelled by wonderful 
cinematography and an intense 
score. The viewer assumes that, 
however confusing the opening 
scene is, answers will come later. 
They don’t.

Nolan maintains this high-

speed, chaotic energy for the rest 
of the movie, but never bothers 
to slow down and explain any 
of it, which amplifies the worst 
qualities of his previous films. He is 
so concerned with his frantic pace, 
and showing off his intelligence by 
referencing entropy, paradoxes, 
inversion, nuclear science and 
whatever a “temporal pincer 
movement” is, that he forgoes 
almost all resolution, character 
development 
and 
cinematic 

structure. He yanks his cardboard 
cutout characters from hyperbolic 
set-piece to hyperbolic set-piece, 
spewing out incoherent science 
fiction world-building as he goes 
along. The first few scenes are 
fascinating, because you think 
it’s all going somewhere. But, as 
the plot becomes increasingly 
convoluted, even doubling back on 
itself, my brain shut off.

At one point, a character tells 

the protagonist “Don’t try and 
understand it.” This seemed like 
a message to the viewer, meaning 
one of two things: This film is 
intentionally 
inexplicable, 
or 

you’re too stupid to understand this 
complex cinematic masterpiece.

Unfortunately, 
though, 

beneath 
all 
the 
pretentious 

scientific esoterica and (perhaps 
intentionally) 
confusing 
plot, 

“Tenet” is just a glorified, multi-
million dollar episode of “Doctor 
Who” (so much so, that anyone 
who has seen the latter will 
probably guess some of the movie’s 
biggest twists). Deep down, it’s an 
incredibly flat science-fiction spy 
story shot with a drab industrial 
palette of greys, blacks and whites 
that do little to make the onslaught 
of plot more appealing.

On top of all this, the characters 

are dimensionless. When your 
protagonist is literally called “The 
Protagonist,” and that’s about the 
extent the viewer knows about him, 

it’s hard to care. Why struggle to 
follow the convoluted story-line 
when you don’t empathize with 
those who inhabit it?

The characters that are given 

a bit of personality are either 
enormously 
melodramatic, 

enormously problematic or both. 
Kenneth Branagh (“Dunkirk”), a 
gem of British acting, is little more 
than a Bond villain parody here, 
bad Russian accent and all. His 
role would’ve been better in the 
experienced hands of Nick Cage. 
The film’s only prominent women 
are both shot. One is needlessly 
terrorized and beaten, to add some 
appearance of depth.

Watching 
“Tenet” 
is 
like 

watching a Rolls-Royce drive, at 
high speed, straight into a brick 
wall. If the car is headed nowhere, 
who cares how fast it’s going, and 
how many times it spins around? 
When the credits rolled, no matter 
how exciting and visually inventive 
“Tenet” occasionally was, how 
bopping a soundtrack it had and how 
good Washington and Pattinson 
were, it felt like a complete waste of 
time.

I have no desire to see it 

again, even without the threat of 
contracting a deadly respiratory 
disease. It’s a waste of both talent 
and a potentially strong premise. A 
dangerous one, too. This isn’t a film 
worth suiting up in a plague outfit 
for or, God forbid, getting sick.

Yet I can’t help but feel that even 

if “Tenet” had been any better, this 
was doomed from the start. First 
Aurora poked some holes, and now 
COVID-19 has ripped the floodgates 
from their hinges and made going 
to the cinema an exercise in sheer 
terror. To find true joyful escape 
within a film, you need to at least 
feel like there is no direct and 
present danger to your life.

SMTD student Nick Daly 
on Playbill contest win

While 
the 
coronavirus 

pandemic 
may 
have 
shut 

down Broadway and left the 
state of professional theatre 
in disarray, Music, Theatre & 
Dance 
sophomore 
Nicholas 

Daly is still finding ways 
to 
continue 
pursuing 
his 

theatrical potential. 

Daly, 
previously 
featured 

by The Michigan Daily for 
his rise to musical theatre 
fame via TikTok, was recently 
named the winner of Playbill’s 

Search for a Star Contest, a 
national 
vocal 
competition 

conducted 
entirely 
through 

virtual audition tapes. After a 
panel of judges consisting of 
Tony Award-winning casting 
directors and choreographers 
narrowed 
down 
the 
2,658 

submissions to the Top 10 
vocalists, it was up to voters 
to name the winner. And 
Daly proved to be America’s 
favorite contender. Following 
his victory, the 19-year-old 
University 
student 
earned 

himself a professional casting 
consultation, 
a 
headshot 

photoshoot and a work session 

with 
Tony 
Award-winning 

director-choreographer Susan 
Stroman, among several other 
professional opportunities. 

While Daly was overcome 

with gratitude for the support 
of his friends, family and 
followers, the week of voting 
proved to be more tragic 
than exciting. As a resident 
of Kenosha, Wisconsin — the 
town where 29-year-old Jacob 
Blake was shot seven times by 
a white officer in late August 
— Daly took a step back from 
plugging the Playbill contest 
to post content that would help 
his community. The shooting

leader and a former Hollywood 
star were indicted for sex 
trafficking and multiple other

was almost guaranteed. With

true-crime genre, it was only a 
matter of time before NXIVM 
became the country’s next

of 
the 
young 
Black 
father 

elicited a considerable amount 
of 
demonstrations 
in 
the 

lakeside city, and Daly found 
the national attention on his 
hometown startling. 

“The 
second 
night 
[of 

protests], there was damage 
that was done to the city, 
which is a bit shocking, 
especially when you see 
it on national headlines,” 
said Daly. “Me and my 
friends definitely joke 
about how we live in 
‘Ke-nowhere’ 
and 
no 

one 
knows 
anything 

about our city. But now 
it’s definitely different 
introducing myself now, 
and saying that I’m from 
Kenosha, Wisconsin, and 
then watching the people 
realize that that’s the 
same [town].”

Kenosha 
and 
its 

district-wide 
theatre 

program 
were 

enormously 
influential 

in developing Daly’s love 
for musical theatre; it was at 
Kenosha’s community theatre 
where he made his theatrical 
debut as the title character in 
“Captain Louie Jr.” During his 
sophomore year at Kenosha’s 
Bradford High School, under 
the mentorship of Educational 
Theatre Association Hall of 
Fame member Holly Stanfield, 
Daly realized storytelling was 
his true calling.

Daly credits much of his 

development as an artist to 
Stainfield and her work at 
Bradford 
High 
School. 
In 

applying to the School of Music, 
Theatre & Dance as a musical 
theatre major, Daly said: “She 
absolutely encouraged me. She 
is an outstanding mentor. She 

inspired me to believe that it 
is something I could make a 
living off of.” The educator was 
even at his University audition: 
“She was there at my Chicago 
unifieds; she was right outside 
at my Michigan audition with 
my mom.” 

Now, 
Daly 
is 
using 
his 

storytelling 
skills 
and 
his 

success at the University to 
make the kind of representation 
for Black theatre artists that he 
never saw as a kid. 

“When I was younger, [the 

representation] was not there. I 
did not see that representation 
at least until I got a lot more 
serious about musical theatre 
during high school,” Daly said, 
referencing performers of color 
like Leslie Odom Jr and Billy 
Porter. 

Daly specifically remembers 

when musical theatre performer 
and director Michael McElroy 
came to the University to direct 
his original show “Sonnets, 
Soliloquies, 
and 
Soul.” 
He 

says watching McElroy lead 
that company “was such a 
learning experience for me. 
Watching that representation, 
being a Black director ... and 
a successful musical theatre 
artist … is huge. I have interests 
other than just being a musical 

theatre performer; I have 
a playwriting minor. I 
love being behind the 
table just as much as I 
love being on stage.”

And to young Black 

artists aspiring to be in 
his shoes one day, Daly 
says: “Don’t put yourself 
in a box. As a Black 
performer 
we 
always 

get those stereotypical, 
token 
roles. 
But, 
I’m 

fortunate at least in my 
high school career that I 
was able to play leading 
characters: 
Quasimodo 

in ‘The Hunchback of 
Notre-Dame,’... as well 
as characters [in shows 
like 
‘The 
Scottsboro 

Boys’] that allowed me to 

embrace my culture. You can do 
just as much as any other actor, 
and beyond.”

Amid 
the 
recent 
events 

surrounding the shooting of 
Jacob Blake in his hometown, 
Daly remains optimistic about 
the 
power 
musical 
theatre 

carries 
in 
bringing 
people 

together. “In itself, musical 
theatre is like an empathy 
machine,” Daly said. “And my 
big thing is: What will save the 
world? What will make people 
understand each other, and take 
us to a more egalitarian place in 
society? I believe the answer is 
empathy.”

L

et’s get down to business, to de-

feat the Huns!” 

I will always remember those 

summer nights I spent sprawled on my 

grandparents’ living room couch in China, 

as I passionately sang along to “I’ll Make a 

Man Out of You” from the animated mov-

ie “Mulan.” Based on an ancient Chinese 

ballad, Disney’s cartoon “Mulan” told the 

story of a young girl who disguised her-

self as a man and enlisted in the army in 

the place of her father. She was constantly 

picked on in the beginning by other fellow 

soldiers due to her physical weaknesses, 

but she eventually proved herself with her 

determination and saved China from the 

Huns.

Though I was only four at the time, in 

the early 2000s, I was fascinated by Mu-

lan’s courage and amused by her clumsy 

yet witty charm. I always laughed uncon-

trollably when Mulan spilled a pot of hot 

tea on her matchmaker’s face and had 

my eyes glued to the TV screen when she 

saved Shang (her love interest) from the 

avalanche during a battle with the Huns. 

As a little Chinese girl, it was refreshing 

for me to see a heroine who shared my 

skin color in a Disney film and inspiring 

to see my own culture being represented 

in such a positive light. She was the first 

Disney princess that I could relate to and 

look up to. 

Therefore, when Disney announced 

that Liu Yifei had been cast to portray 

my favorite Disney princess in 2017, I was 

beyond excited. I was also relieved that 

this role would be represented by a native 

Chinese actress and celebrated Disney’s 

choice for diversity. Ever since, I close-

ly followed the production timeline and 

made plans to see it with my friends upon 

its release. When I went to see “Little 
Women” at my local theatre last Decem-

ber, I saw the “Mulan” trailer play on the 

big screen. I shed a few tears as I watched 

Yifei fighting fiercely on the battlefield 

while the orchestral version of “Reflec-

tion” played in the background. I was 

so thrilled to see my childhood heroine 

being represented authentically and the 

film’s potential to make Asian American 

cinematic history.

Yet, as I settled in to watch the remake, 

I felt skepticism creeping up even from 

the opening scenes. I raised my eyebrows 

at the sight of a hakka tulou — which is 

a form of architecture unique to south-

eastern China — as Mulan’s home, which 

is known to be located in northern Chi-

na. I cringed again when Mulan’s father 

said to her: “Chi is for warriors, not for 

daughters.” Originated from Taoism, Chi 

is a vital energy that everyone is born with 

regardless of gender. I was also confused 

when writers used “abundance of chi” to 

describe the witch as powerful, because 

one does not gain power by merely having 

chi but rather through their cultivation of 

it. 

As the film went on, I became increas-

ingly angered by the obvious neglect the 

production crew showed for Chinese cul-

tural references key to the central plot. 

The film showed the Chinese character 

for filial piety, an ancient Confucian “vir-

tue,” engraved on two objects: on the “am-

ulet” (with an oriental design that did not 

resemble anything real Chinese people 

would carry) that belongs to Mulan’s fa-

ther and on the sword that was gifted to 

Mulan by the emperor. The writers clearly 

dismissed the fact that in Chinese culture, 

filial piety means more than “devotion to 

family,” as it is criticized by contemporary 

feminists for its implications of blind obe-

dience and submission to elders. It is true 

that Mulan is no modern tale, but the val-

ues that she fights for in the film are di-

rectly contradicted by the outdated notion 

of filial piety that Disney writers inadver-

tently imposed on her.

While I was infuriated by Disney’s lack 

of effort in historical fact-checking, I was 

disappointed the most by Mulan’s “flaw-

lessness” as a character. In the original 

movie, she is an ordinary girl who knows 

nothing about fighting, but through her 

perseverance and grit, she becomes a true 

warrior. In the remake, however, Mulan 

serves as a “Chinese Elsa” whose super-

powers are rejected by society because 

they do not conform to social expectations 

of women. While such reinvention of the 

folklore establishes a feminist premise for 

Mulan’s story, it rejects further possibili-

ties for her growth. What is the point of 

her story if she already fights better than 

all the men? 

This new portrayal of Mulan feels for-

eign to me, as I was unable to connect 

with her innate power and lack of vulner-

abilities. My favourite Disney princess 

used to be Mulan, not because she was an 

all-powerful warrior, but the fact that she 

felt like one of “us.” She was just an ordi-

nary girl who was both scared and excited 

about the world, who simply wanted to be 

understood, and then left alone. The way 

she clumsily finds herself through hard-

ships and betrayals was inspiring because 

it gave me hope that I could do it too. 

By drastically changing the story and 

Mulan’s motives without any explanation 

or foundation behind it, her character is 

denied agency and becomes an Asian fan-

tasy with no real identity. In the remake, 

Mulan becomes General Tso’s Chicken — 

an essentially American dish with some 

Chinese sesame drizzled on top. With the 

new film, I lost a childhood heroine whom 

I most identified with, and a generation of 

Asian American girls have been misrepre-

sented by an orientalist puppet for Holly-

wood white feminism.

Prior to “Mulan,” the only all-Asian-

cast Hollywood film that had entered 

the mainstream was “Crazy Rich Asians.” 

Though the film was a huge milestone 

in cinematic history and inspired more 

Asian faces to be represented on screen, 

I was unable to form a real cultural con-

nection to the characters and storytelling. 

Yes, the film included many Asian cultural 

references such as families making dump-

lings together and playing mahjong, but it 

failed to explore many themes key to the 

Asian American identity, such as the no-

tion of the model minority and internal-

ized racism. Rather, “Crazy Rich Asians” 

focused mainly on class anxieties, which 

was a theme universal and therefore more 

digestible for Western audiences. While 

class remains an important topic to ad-

dress, omitting themes and issues relevant 

to Asian American culture and identity is 

damaging to the integrity of such repre-

sentation.

Neither the “Mulan” remake nor “Cra-

zy Rich Asians” went deep enough to cre-

ate nuanced characters — they simply cast 

Asian actors and chose filming locations 

in Asia, as if that were enough. Niki Caro, 

the director of the “Mulan” remake, ex-

pressed, “It was incredibly important to 

us that the people in our film were au-

thentically the ethnicities they needed to 

be for the storytelling.” However, these 

principles of authenticity were obviously 

dismissed behind the scenes, as the script 

was co-written by four white writers and 

no Chinese experts were consulted for its 

historical or cultural accuracy.

What does this mean? Must Asians be 

Westernized in order to enter mainstream 

American culture? I think the answer is 

no. I still remember my excitement and 

pride when I heard BTS, a K-pop group, 

play in my local department store in To-

ronto. I still think about when the Acade-

my Award–winning movie “Parasite” was 

all people talked about; I would hear con-

versation about it while walking down 

State Street or while sitting in the East 
Quad dining hall or in the moments be-

fore class time. Both BTS and “Parasite” 

have reached huge cultural and commer-

cial successes in the United States, yet 

neither creators compromised their art 

to cater to Americans: BTS stated that 

they will not produce English albums and 

Bong Joon-ho, the director of “Parasite,” 

didn’t cut out a single Korean cultural 

reference when the film premiered in 

the U.S. Through sheer genius and hard 

work, the two were able to overcome cul-

tural barriers and accumulate global sup-

port, forcing diversity into America’s in-

sular entertainment industry.

Disney’s failure with “Mulan” sends 

a clear message to Hollywood that the 

Asian American experience is not an easy 

tale to tell. It will require more than $200 

million in budgets and four white screen-

writers. It demands the stories to reflect 

our anxieties and fears, our disconnect 

from the mainstream and our linkage to 

our homeland. The failure of the Mulan 

remake shows that the Asian American 

experience can never be represented by 

those who don’t share our identity, and 

that true representation is not only re-

flected in the cast but also through Asian 

writers, directors and producers, and a 

deep understanding of how to honestly 

portray our past and stories. So perhaps 

one day, our reflection on the big screen 

will show who we are inside.

Disney’s Mulan 
remake: General 
Tso’s Chicken

BY LOLA YANG, STATEMENT CORRESPONDENT

ILLUSTRATION BY EILEEN KELLY


P

erhaps one of the most cursed 

images a young woman can con-

jure is the female dressing room 

— the one tucked in the backstage corner 

of every theatre, dance studio and concert 

hall. With its taunting mirrored walls and 

the rancid stenches of burnt hair and the 

nervous sweat only starved teenage girls 

can produce, the place is hellish in the 

most basic sense. 

Having grown up doing theatre and 

competitive show choir, I’ve experienced 
that hairspray-scented inferno countless 

times. Girls in dressing rooms like to act 

as though they’re unbothered by the hor-

ror of it all — the sheepish undressing and 

anxious glances in floor-length mirrors, 

frantically stuffing your clothes in the 

deepest corners of the room so no one sees 

how ugly your underwear is or how enor-

mously-sized your jeans are. But, no mat-

ter how strong you like to think you are, 

the hyper-consciousness we, as women, 

already feel toward our bodies increases 

ten-fold the moment we walk through 

that door. We know that the quicker we 

undress, the less time other girls have to 

observe our stomach rolls or our stretch 

marks or, God forbid, that one patch of 

cellulite on your left thigh that no exfoli-

ant can seem to alleviate. So, to minimize 

the gaze of the observer, you move like 

your life depends on it and get out of there 

as fast as you can.

I thought I had escaped this unfor-

giving landscape when I graduated high 

school. I was wrong. 

I was sitting in my third — but what 

felt like my ninetieth — Zoom class of the 

week when I took in the image of our vir-

tual classroom, with its stacked profiles 

and rows of women staring into their re-

flection. A moment of clarity came over 

me as I realized what it really resembled: 

A dressing room — that horrific call to my 

girlhood. 

Zoom’s rectangular profiles act as the 

room’s mirrored walls. We may be in class, 

listening and participating, but we’re also 

primping. The girl mid-center fixes her 

hair there, then another girl on the bot-

tom left corner adjusts her glasses. An-

other quickly sits more upright when she 

sees the look of her slouched posture in 

the camera.

As my professor went on about the 

class syllabus, all I could think about was 

this dystopian-looking and completely de-

pressing grid of reflections: girls primp-

ing, then fixing, then checking, then fixing 

again. And I was doing it too — obsessively 
fixing my bangs, turning over my necklac-

es until they fell at the perfect spot on my 

chest, using the camera to analyze wheth-

er or not I was smiling enough in class. 

We were fidgeting robots, adhering to the 

automated voices in our head telling us to 

move our head, fix that one stray strand 

of hair, smile a bit more — anything to ap-

pease the cameras in front of us. We were 

stuck in a figurative dressing room, bound 

only by the strength of our internet con-

nection, hyperconscious of our appear-

ance, fixated on the reflections we saw.

So why do we fidget and primp our way 

through virtual classes?

Believe it or not, the narrative of wom-

en as vain creatures originated long be-

fore the time of cameras and video calls. 

A woman staring into a mirror — an im-

age so sacred — is the product of centuries 

of historical, psychological and socio-po-

litical precedent — even Shakespeare was 

gifting us with sonnets about vanity, beau-

ty and fertility as captured by a woman’s 

reflection.

At the beginning of the 20th century, 

American psychologists assigned ter-

minology to this enduring phenomenon 

when they explored the notion of the 

“looking-glass self,” which asserts that 

a person’s sense of self is partially con-

structed by how others perceive them. 

While initial theorizing mostly mused 

on the non-physical sense of self, in later 

years there was a greater focus on the idea 

of the looking-glass self as applied to how 

women view our physical bodies.

Enter feminist theorist Simone de 

Beauvoir. Beauvoir argued that “when a 

girl becomes a woman, she becomes dou-

bled; so instead of existing only within 

herself, she also exists outside herself.” 

Thus, once she enters womanhood, the 

adolescent girl is socialized to “exist out-

side herself,” or in other terms, objectify 

herself as others — usually men — would 

objectify her.

The psychological study of women’s 

self-objectification 
gained 
significant 

momentum when Barbara L. Fredrickson 

of the University of Michigan and Tomi-

Ann Roberts of Colorado College gave 

this doubled womanly existence a name 

and a reason: objectification theory. The 

conjecture proposes that girls and women 

tend to internalize a third-person per-

spective — an observer’s perspective — as 

the principal view of their physical bod-

ies. This internalized perspective can lead 

to shame (woohoo!), anxiety (fun!), self-

disgust (sounds about right) and behavior 

of constant adjusting that psychologists 

like to call “habitual body monitoring.” 

Sounds familiar? That’s because this 

kind of obsessive preening is taking place 

in every Zoom call across campus, where 

you’re forced to stare at — and scrutinize 

— yourself in the camera for hours at a 

time. 

LSA freshman Rebekah Turner told The 

Daily how she has become accustomed to 

this very kind of behavior.

“The first week of classes, I didn’t nec-

essarily feel pressure to look good for 

Zoom, but I could constantly see myself 

playing with my hair and looking at my-

self,” Turner said. “It is distracting think-

ing, ‘Oh, is my hair good? ... Should I do 

my makeup?’ I feel like I stare at myself a 

lot and think, ‘Oh, I look so bad.’”

We’re constantly trying to assume the 

perspective of this imaginary, third-per-

son observer. And Zoom simply digitizes 

this experience. 

Turner said, “For my PoliSci class, 

there’s like 200 people there. It’s hard be-

cause I’m thinking, ‘Oh, is someone look-

ing at me right now?’”

The way your female classmates check 

their profile image throughout Zoom lec-

tures is not based on some shallow, girl-

ish tendency to obsess over their appear-

ance. It’s rooted in a deeply misogynistic 

notion we’re fed that our identity and our 

value rests entirely on how we are physi-

cally perceived by others. These enduring 

effects of self-objectification by women 

means sexism endures, deeply embedded 
in the subconscious. 

Turner summarized this experience in 

a few words: “(On Zoom,) you really are 

sitting in front of a mirror for an hour and 

a half,” she said.

I interviewed two other random stu-

dents on the Diag about their Zoom expe-

rience, and the similarities between their 

remarks and Turner’s are striking.

Public Health junior Reem Farjo said, 

“I am definitely more aware of my appear-

ance than when I was in in-person classes. 

It’s like if I showed up to class with a mir-

ror.”

LSA freshman Gabi Skinner concluded 

with, “(On Zoom,) it’s like you’re sitting 

in front of a mirror, with 200 other mini-

mirrors, so comparison is really, really 

easy.”

In Zoom classes, in dressing rooms, 

walking down a dark street, walking 

through a crowded lecture hall, we’re 

there and we’re outside ourselves, observ-

ing, self-criticizing, listening to our sub-

conscious as we adjust appropriately, with 

a swift brush of the hair or tucking of the 

shirt, with a rapid Chapstick application 

or adjustment of our dress strap. We’re 

fixing like robots — like the very pixels 

making up your Zoom screens. This time 

around, virtual learning means we have 

a monitor to keep track of this obsessive 

primping and the habitual body monitor-

ing. Just don’t call it laughable, don’t call 

it a distraction. Call it what it is: Sexism 

that endures and a true feminist issue.

The (really far) 
off-campus experience

BY WILLA HART, STATEMENT COLUMNIST

L

ast March, when the University 

announced that classes would be 

moved online, I was in a philoso-

phy seminar, cramming with my classmates 

for the exam we had in five minutes. It was 

one of those classmates who read out the 

University’s official statement, the rest of us 

sitting in hushed silence, our notebooks ly-

ing open and forgotten in front of us. “Well,” 

another classmate said, “I guess we all get to 

go home now.”

“Not until you take your test,” my profes-

sor said and dropped a thick stack of exams 

on his desk.
W

hen I think back now about 

my decision to return home 

last March, I don’t remem-

ber many specifics — other than how quickly 

I made the decision to leave Ann Arbor. As 

soon as I stepped outside my philosophy 

classroom, my midterm finished, I was pull-

ing my phone out of my pocket and texting 

my dad: “Classes moved online. When can 

you come get me?”

The speed of my decision was made par-

tially possible by my family’s proximity to 

Ann Arbor — my dad lives in Hamburg, less 

than half an hour away — but also by the fact 

that my “decision” barely felt like a decision 

at all. Everyone seemed to assume a shift 

to online learning would mean a shift off-

campus. Around me, friends and classmates 

were making plans to return home and ride 

out the pandemic with family. It seemed like 

the smartest move, especially given that, at 

the time, we didn’t have specifics about how 

fatal or contagious the virus was. If I had 

any lingering resentment over having to take 

classes from my dad’s guest bedroom, it was 

softened by the knowledge that everyone 

else at Michigan was in the exact same boat 

as me.

When I decided not to return to campus 

this fall due to safety concerns, I expected 

my experience to be much the same. Yes, I 

would miss game days and Espresso Royale, 

doing homework in the Arb and browsing 

Literati, but everyone on campus would be 

missing those things with me. We were still, 

I thought, all in this together.

I was surprised by how wrong I was. In 

August, before the semester had even start-

ed, I began to feel isolated from the campus 

community. Though it didn’t bother me to 

have fully-remote classes, it was hard to see 

friends in Ann Arbor posting photos of each 

other posing and laughing. I FaceTimed in; it 

wasn’t the same. 

Public Health senior Scott Orlov ex-

pressed a similar sentiment in a phone in-

terview with The Daily. Though he acknowl-

edged that staying home had its benefits, he 

said, “One of my clubs is having potentially 

one or two in-person events, and obviously I 

can’t be there, which is really disappointing.” 

He added, “I think it’s different (than last 

semester) because a lot of people weren’t, 

like, socializing on campus like they are now. 

A lot of people were in the same situation I 

was, which was they just went home.”

Students who chose not to return to Ann 

Arbor this semester often had multiple rea-

sons for doing so, and many were motivated 

by factors unrelated to safety. Some students 

I spoke with chose to remain home for finan-

cial reasons, reducing housing costs by stay-

ing for free with family or in areas with rents 

lower than Ann Arbor’s. Others were mo-

tivated by job availability or a desire to live 

in a less cramped space than your standard 

student apartment. But, regardless, the rea-

son most often cited was health and safety 

concerns.

In a phone interview, LSA junior Piya 

Garg commented on her decision not to re-

turn to campus, noting her skepticism of the 

University’s reopening plan and student be-

havior.

“I feel like there’s a lot of people who are 

very responsible, but there’s a pretty sig-

nificant chunk of people (who are) decently 

irresponsible and not really following the 

rules,” Garg said. “And they’re not really be-

ing enforced, so I feel like it’s definitely just 

best to stay safe in this situation.”

My decision not to return to campus was 

similarly rooted in safety concerns. I had 

a lease lined up in Escher House, a co-op 

within the Inter-Cooperative Council sys-

tem. Though I had a private room, I knew 

I would also have at least a dozen house-

mates with whom I would share living and 

dining spaces. Having seen several reports 

in early August about COVID-19 clusters at 

other major universities, I decided returning 

wasn’t worth the risk.

It wasn’t an easy decision for me, as I imag-

ine it wasn’t for others. I had to say goodbye 

to my vision of what my senior year would 

look like; now, instead of (legally!) drinking 

gross beer at frat parties, I’m sipping ginger 

ale on my mom’s couch. I believe I made the 

right decision, for the right reasons, and I 

don’t regret it. But recently, I’ve found my-

self harboring an emotion different from re-

gret: I’ve become resentful of students who 

returned to campus. 

It’s like travel shaming, a new COVID-

phenomenon wherein people taking vaca-

tions — and sharing about them on social 

media — are often deluged with criticism 

about their decision to travel. Usually, as the 

above article points out, it’s those who have 

canceled their own trips who are quickest to 

judge others. I made a sacrifice to help stop 

the spread of COVID-19, the thought process 

goes: Why couldn’t others do the same?

I recognize that my feelings aren’t com-

pletely logical and that most students who’ve 

returned to Ann Arbor have done nothing to 

earn my resentment. If everyone appropri-

ately obeyed social distancing protocols, as 

many students have, the process of returning 

to campus could be safe for students, staff 

and community members. 

But it’s difficult to remember that when 

I’m sitting in bed with my dog, watching 

Snapchat videos of my friends wandering 

down State Street to get burritos and wish-

ing I could be there, too. Harder still when a 

mob of white-shirted girls appears behind 

my friends’ shoulders, their lipsticked smiles 

clear and unmasked even in the dim eve-

ning light, because, of course, many students 

aren’t obeying social distancing protocols at 

all.T

he year 2020, so far, has been 

a year of extremes. For many 

people, the world feels like it’s 

at the worst it’s ever been. It should be no 

wonder, then, that the University of Michi-

gan campus community also feels more 

disconnected than ever. The on-campus/

off-campus divide is only one fracture line 

in the smashed mirror of our community. 

Everywhere I turn, there seems to be an-

other difference of opinion: divisions be-

tween roommates about adherence to social 

distancing protocol, arguments about the 

potential for a return to fall sports, debates 

about the GEO, ResStaff strike for change 

and campus COVID-19 policy.

That’s not to say there aren’t normally 

divisions among the campus community. 

University students are not a monolith, and, 

diverse as we are, we should be used to dis-

agreeing in social, political and even ethical 

opinions. But for the first time ever, I’m un-

sure where the thread is that ties us all to-

gether. This time last year, maybe we would 

have slung our arms around our drunk 

friends and hobbled down to Michigan Sta-

dium for a collective karaoke session, which 

would have healed all wounds, if only for a 

verse or two. Of course, this year, that’s not 

an option. So, what do we do instead? Set up 

a Zoom call? Make another GroupMe?

Knowing this is the Michigan I’ll be grad-

uating from is hard. I’ve spent so long here, 

and yet I know this endless year will be what 

I remember most. Part of me wishes I could 

go back to Ann Arbor for the afternoon, just 

to see it. I haven’t returned since March, and 

when I think of campus, some part of me 

imagines it just as it was before I left, filled 

with students and businesses and the detri-

tus of everyday life. If only I could go back, 

I think, maybe everything would be normal 

again.

But that campus doesn’t exist anymore. 

Now, it’s scattered and distant, a ghost of its 

former self. I hope one day it’ll return to nor-

mal: It would be nice, in a few years, to be 

able to return and see everything put back in 

its proper place. Still, it’s hard to imagine the 

path that would get us there. Could every-

thing really return to the way it was before? 

And even if it did, what help is that for those 

of us now, sitting lost and disconnected on 

the fringes?

Yost through the eyes of the equipment manager

The dull whir of the skate 

sharpening machine sets a fitting 
background noise. 

Masked up in an empty Yost 

Ice Arena, Long-time Michigan 
hockey equipment manager Ian 
Hume sits at his desk, a wall 
of skates to his left. Before our 
interview can begin, a visitor 
arrives. 
Freshman 
forward 

Phillippe Lapointe enters the 
office, asking if his skates are 
done. 

It’s a simple question, but 

there’s a lot more to it. Hume 
works with Lapointe to figure out 
how much extra steel he wants on 
his blades. 

Though a simple interaction, 

Hume is doing what he does best: 
getting to know his players. 

“Now I know where to start 

with him and we’ll go from 
there,” Hume said. “It’s kind of 
a feel thing. I’ll make a couple of 
adjustments and try to get him 
dialed in.”

Hume is a hockey guy through 

and through. He grew up in 
Canada, and like many Canadians, 
hockey was his lifeblood. 

“When I was growing up as 

a kid, there were two seasons; it 
was hockey and road hockey,” 
Hume said. “You played road 
hockey when the snow went away 
and when the snow came back we 
were in the rinks or outdoor rinks 
or ponds or whatever. It was just 
hockey, hockey, hockey.” 

Hume got on Michigan’s radar 

by working in junior leagues 
in Ontario, an area in which 
Michigan 
recruited 
heavily. 

There, he got to know former 
coach Red Berenson, and after 
getting married, he and his wife 
moved to Ann Arbor, where he 
kept in touch with Berenson. 

Then, he literally walked into 

a job. 

“I just happened to walk in (to 

Yost) one day in July and they 
were doing a kids hockey camp,” 
Hume said. “I knew Red pretty 
well by that point and I just 

walked in to see how he was doing 
and he said ‘You couldn’t have 
come in here on a worse day.’ ”

Berenson 
had 
just 
seen 

multiple assistants, his video guy 
and his equipment manager leave 
the program for the University 
Illinois at Chicago’s hockey team. 
Ironically, that program no longer 
exists. 

Berenson asked Hume if he was 

still looking for a job and Hume 
told him he was. He was offered 
the equipment manager position 
on the spot. 

“He 
cleared 
it 
with 

administration 
and 
31 
years 

later I’m still here,” Hume said. 
“So I owe where I am and all my 
experiences; I owe that to coach 
Berenson.” 

Hume 
was 
on 
Berenson’s 

coaching staff for nearly his entire 
tenure, and he stayed on when 
head coach Mel Pearson took over 
in 2017. 

“Red 
wasn’t 
necessarily 

negative, but I would say that 
Red was old school.” Hume said. 
“(Mel’s) different then coach 
Berenson. He wants it to be fun 
for the players and I think he 
wants it to be fun for us. There 
can be enough negativity when 
people aren’t playing well, and so 
it’s pretty easy. He likes to be very 
positive.”

Hume’s official role is to handle 

all the equipment-related tasks. 

He’s in charge of getting all the 
jerseys, pads, helmets, decals and 
anything else you could think of 
ready for the players. The process 
to pack all of that up for a road 
game is relatively easy. What 
takes a while is gathering and 
replacing the extra equipment 
that travels with the team all 
season — including five sticks per 
player for a road trip. 

“We take enough stuff so that 

if there’s a problem, we’ve usually 
got it covered,” Hume said. 

Talking to him, it’s clear that 

he’s so much more than just the 
equipment manager. Hume has 
an open-door policy, and whether 
players 
want 
to 
talk 
about 

equipment adjustments or are 
just tired of coaching and want to 
chat, Hume is there. 

“(Hockey’s) the longest college 

season. It’s a long grind from 
when you start in September and 
you don’t end sometimes until mid 
April,” Hume said. “It may not be 
physically demanding as far as 
the number of games you play, but 
you’re practicing and it mentally 
can wear you out. So you get guys 
that come in and shoot the breeze 
about whatever.” 

Through those conversations, 

Hume has gotten to know a lot 
of players in the program in his 
three decades at Michigan. He’s 
noticed a trend. The less tinkering 
a player does, the more success 

they usually have. 

“One of our sayings is it’s not 

the tools, it’s the carpenter,” 
Hume said. “Most guys are pretty 
good, but some guys are finicky 
and they don’t need to be.”

Former Michigan defenseman 

Quinn Hughes exemplified this. 
Hughes had an incredible career 
at 
Michigan 
and 
continued 

to perform in his first year in 
the NHL with the Vancouver 
Canucks. He piled up 43 assists 
and is a finalist for the Calder 
Trophy — awarded to the top 
rookie each year. 

This instant success was no 

surprise to Hume. Hughes went 
through very few sticks and just 
wanted his skates to be kept sharp. 

“(He) 
was 
literally 
no 

maintenance,” Hume said. “The 
kid just wants to play.”

At this point, Hume has seen it 

all. Even in a pandemic, he’s still 
going into work, checking in on 
his players and keeping everyone’s 
skates sharpened — extra steel 
and all. But it’s not really about the 
equipment. It’s that every guy on 
the Wolverines can come in and 
talk to Hume about anything. It’s 
been that way for 31 years. 

“Teams can change, personnel 

can change, people can change,” 
Hume 
said. 
“But 
it’s 
the 

relationships you build that last 
forever. I think that’s what’s 
unique about hockey.”

Film Breakdown: What to expect from Austin Davis’s fifth year with ‘M’

Over breakfast with Michigan 

coach 
Juwan 
Howard 
last 

February, Austin Davis’s fate for 
this upcoming college basketball 
season was sealed. 

The 
then-redshirt 
junior 

would be returning for a fifth 
year in the fall. 

It 
wasn’t 
too 
long 
ago 

that 
Davis 
was 
largely 
an 

afterthought. He struggled to 
acclimate to the college game, 
sitting out his first year and 
playing sparingly over the next 
two seasons — just twice did he 
see double-digit minutes over 
the course of 2017-18 and 2018-
19. 

Last season seemed destined 

for more of the same. Davis 
started 
off 
as 
the 
third-

string center, leapfrogged in 
the 
rotation 
by 
sophomore 

Colin Castleton. He sat on the 
sidelines for seven of Michigan’s 
first eleven games. 

And yet he managed to turn a 

corner. Davis flourished under 
Howard’s tutelage, establishing 
himself as the backup to Jon 
Teske. In a Big Ten stacked 
with viable big men, he was a 
revelation. 

“It’s great to have Austin 

Davis on our side,” Howard said 
after an 89-65 win over Indiana 
last February, a game in which 
Davis contributed 11 points. 
“Austin is wired the right way. 
He’s such a giver. Total team 
guy. Never tried to go for his 
numbers or do anything he’s not 
good at. Come in with the right 
attitude in practice, working 
hard. Buying into the teaching 
and the developing. And he’s 
going out and having a great 
carryover game after game.”

With Teske having graduated 

in May, Davis’s importance is 
magnified. 
Michigan’s 
other 

true big man is freshman Hunter 
Dickinson, and while Dickinson 
is 
talented, 
the 
transition 

from high school to college 
necessitates a learning curve — 
just ask Davis.

The Daily took a closer look 

at what went right for Davis 
during his breakout campaign 

and where there’s room for 
improvement entering his last 
go-around. 

The pick and roll was more 

integral to Michigan’s offense 
than almost any other offensive 
set 
last 
season. 
According 

to 
Synergy, 
the 
Wolverines 

averaged 28.5 points per game 
off the pick and roll, the fourth 
highest total in the nation. 

Luckily for Davis, it’s an 

element of the game in which he 
excels. 

In 
this 
clip 
taken 
from 

Michigan’s February matchup 
with Rutgers at Madison Square 
Garden, Davis frees up the 
ball-handler, Eli Brooks, with 
a textbook screen. As Brooks 
veers right, Davis’s defender 
hedges out, leaving him in the 
clear. 

Brooks threads the needle 

with a bounce pass and hits 
Davis in stride. Rather than 
force up an ill-advised shot, 
Davis flashes his poise. He 
possesses the wherewithal to 
recognize the help defender 
blitzing in from the far corner 
to front him on the block. 
Working 
methodically, 
he 

gathers himself, takes a dribble 
and ducks under the air-borne 
defender. 
When 
a 
second 

defender closes in, he bides 
even more time with another 
successful fake, making for an 
easy basket. 

Davis’ actions on the court 

are often coherent. It’s when he 
rushes that his play deviates — 
shuffled feet, forced shots. He 
is at his best when he slows the 
game down. 

On this play, even after point 

guard Zavier Simpson stumbles 
with his dribble, Davis holds 
his ground down low. The 
patience pays off, with Simpson 
squeaking 
free 
and 
finding 

Davis for the two-handed slam. 

A portion of Davis’s pick 

and roll success can surely be 
attributed to Simpson’s ability as 
an orchestrator. Now, Davis will 
have to rely more heavily on the 
trio of Brooks, graduate transfer 
Mike Smith and freshman Zeb 
Jackson to execute the two-man 
game. 

Second-chance 
points 
are 

back-breakers, and no Wolverine 
displayed a knack for securing 
offensive rebounds quite like 
Davis did last season. Out of his 
62 total boards, 24 occurred on 
the offensive end 
— a 37 percent clip 
that stood as the 
highest mark on the 
team. 

This play begins 

with 
a 
similar 

sequence 
as 
the 

prior 
one. 
Davis 

sets a ball screen 
and both defenders 
chase 
the 
ball-

handler, collapsing 
on David DeJulius.

DeJulius, 
though, 
isn’t 

looking for Davis. On the other 
side of the court, Brandon 
Johns Jr. walls off Indiana’s 
Rob Phinisee with an off-ball 
screen, freeing Brooks for a 
shot attempt. While not the 

focal point, Davis nonetheless 
strives to make an impact: he 
beelines into the heart of the 
paint, positioning himself for a 
possible offensive rebound. 

By 
the 

time 
Davis’s 

defender 
leaves 
DeJulius, 
he’s too late 
— Davis, as if 
on defense, is 
boxing 
out. 

When Brooks’ 
three-pointer 
falls off, Davis 
out-wills four 

Hoosiers for the rebound, using 
his 6-foot-10, 250 pound frame 
to his advantage and finishing 
off the move with a layup in 
traffic. 

If there’s a clear area where 

Davis has room to grow, it’s 
perimeter defense. 

By all means, Davis is a 

traditional big man. His scoring 
radius is largely confined to 
the paint. Jump shots, let alone 
3-pointers, are absent from his 
arsenal. 

And 
in 
today’s 
era 
of 

basketball, the stretch-‘5’ is a 
hot commodity. A big man like 
Davis can thrive in the paint on 
the offensive end, but only so 
long as he can venture outwards 
on defense. 

Against Ohio State, Davis 

matched up against versatile 
big man Kaleb Wesson. Here, 
Wesson catches the entry pass 
with his back to the basket 
before 
quickly 
pivoting 
to 

face the hoop, leaving Davis 
vulnerable to a dribble-drive. 
Wesson lulls Davis with a few 
jab-steps then darts right. A 
slow first step dooms Davis, who 
winds up on Wesson’s backside 
and commits a foul. 

In 
guarding 
the 
inside-

outside big, Davis has to make 
a concerted effort to be out far 
enough to contest a perimeter 
shot. 
Last 
year 
against 

Wisconsin, for instance, he was 
a virtual non-factor due to his 
inability to challenge three-
point threats Micah Potter and 
Nate Reuvers along the arc. 

Without Teske, Michigan will 

need Davis to stay on the court 
for long stretches and out of foul 
trouble. Improved individual 
defense is therefore all the more 
imperative. 

Last year, after spending 

three seasons riding the bench, 
Davis proved he could hold 
his own among stiff Big Ten 
competition. If he can continue 
to make strides, he will not only 
help ease Dickinson’s transition 
to the college level, but also 
make Michigan all the more 
dangerous.

Drew Kendall in no rush

Drew Kendall was supposed to 

be committed by now.

On Aug. 28, the four-star 

offensive linemen — a top target for 
Michigan in the 2021 class — told 
247Sports that he’d be committing 
in the next week. It would have 
been the end to a four-horse race 
between the Wolverines, Boston 
College, 
Duke 
and 
Stanford. 

Instead, there’s been radio silence 
from Dedham, Mass.

“He’s very open-minded and 

he’s not rushing to make a final 
decision,” 
Panos 
Voulgaris, 

Kendall’s coach at Nobles and 
Greenough School, said. “And I 
think the fact that it doesn’t look 
like we’re gonna be playing any 
games, it hasn’t expedited the 
decision at all. 

“So he’s being patient and he 

wants to have the most clarity on 
making a final decision. So no rush 
at this point.”

That may not be a bad thing 

for Michigan. After losing four-
star guard Rocco Spindler to 
Notre Dame last month, Kendall 
seems to be the best remaining 
option on the 2021 board at the 
position. The Wolverines have 
four offensive line commits for the 
class — centers Raheem Anderson 
and Greg Crippen, both four stars, 
four-star tackle Giovanni El-Hadi 
and three-star tackle Tristan 
Bounds. 

Kendall, a top-10 guard and 

top-130 recruit on 247Sports’ 
composite score, would fit nicely 
into that mix.

“I 
think 
athletically 
and 

technically, he’s gonna be ready 
to go (in college),” Voulgaris said. 
“It’s just a matter of being put in 
an environment where there are 
several other players at his level. 
And getting used to that speed and 
to the pace of practice and to what 
Power 5 football demands. So it’s 
just a matter of acclimating.”

Voulgaris said Kendall is over 

265 pounds right now and could 
develop to as big as 295. Even over 
a summer marred by COVID-19, 

he found ways to work out.

“He made a lot of gains in the 

weight room, with his strength 
numbers,” 
Voulgaris 
said, 

“and also with his numbers on 
the field as far as agility time, 
explosiveness, speed, quickness, 
all that stuff.”

Kendall’s father, Pete, had a 

13-year NFL career as an offensive 
linemen after a college career at 
Boston College. He works on the 
Nobles coaching staff now, and 
Voulgaris credits him with much 
of Drew’s development. Voulgaris 
said Kendall has been exposed to 
gap, man and zone run schemes in 
high school, making his transition 
to college easier.

In Massachusetts, it’s unlikely 

there will be a high school football 
season this fall. Coupled with a 
recruiting dead period, that puts 
situations like Kendall’s in limbo. 
Instead of a season, there’s an 
indefinite run of practices without 
anything to practice for or any 
college coaches coming through 
town.

“Naturally he’s disappointed, 

like everyone who’s a competitor, 
by not playing in the games,” 
Voulgaris 
said. 
“But 
he’s 

controlling what he can control, 
and making sure that he takes 
advantage of the practice time that 
he has and this extra time in the 
weight room and he’s gonna make 
gains where he can.”

Even 
in 
those 
practices, 

Voulgaris sees Kendall leading 
and 
setting 
the 
tone, 
other 

players looking up to him. He’s 
seen Kendall display that sort of 
attitude since they first met, three 
years ago.

“Even before I ever saw him get 

onto the field, this is someone who 
loves the game of football and you 
see it in the way he communicates 
about it, the way he interacts with 
coaches,” Voulgaris said. “His 
desire to learn the game, whether 
it’s on the white board, in the 
film room or when it comes to 
the actual being on the field and 
getting better from a physical 
standpoint and a competitive 
standpoint.”

Above all, Saturday in Ann Arbor missed the people

FILE PHOTO/Daily

On what would have been the Wolverines' home opener, Michigan Stadium sat empty, as did many of the traditionally lively tailgating spots.

-

wo-hundred-
eighty-nine days 
ago, when 110,000 
fans filed out of 
Michigan Stadium, 

sadness 
glued to 
their faces 
after yet 
another 
loss to 
Ohio State, 
they had a 
date 
circled on 
their 
calendars: 
September 12, 2020.
That was the date when 
many of those 110,000 would 
come back to the corner of 
Main and Stadium, ready to 
do it all over again. They 
would come from fraternity 
tailgates and house parties, 
brunch buffets and golf 
course cookouts, but their 
final destination would be 
the same: the home of this 
great tradition that’s 
spanned 137 consecutive falls 
in Ann Arbor.
It’s one of those traditions 
that’s marked less by what 
happens on the field than off 
it. It’s the sights and sounds, 
not the wins and losses, that 
bring those 110,000 coming 
back year after year.
Instead, on Saturday 
afternoon, the sight was 
emptiness and the sound was 
silence.
The Wolverines were still 
there, practicing inside 
Michigan Stadium for a 
season that may never come. 
This week, there are 
murmurs that it might, but 
such rumors have come and 
gone with remarkable 
consistency since the Big 
Ten canceled football on 
Aug. 11.
So for now, all we have on 
these typically-hallowed fall 
Saturdays are closed-door 

practices. And yet, somehow, 
that’s the most normal part.
The first strange thing on 
Saturday morning was that I 
woke up to my alarm. 
Normally, in my house across 
the street from East Quad, 
such an accessory would be 
superfluous, so long as I 
wanted to wake up after 6 
a.m.
On this Saturday, though, 
silence was the defining 
feature. It enveloped the air 
on Hill Street, where 
thousands of would-be 

tailgaters took advantage of 
the opportunity to sleep in. 
A handful of frat houses 
picked up the remains of 
illicit parties from the night 
before, but for the most part, 
there was little sign of life.
Where sheets would typical-
ly hang from house windows 
and porches, taunting poor 
Ball State with creative 
messages, there was only 
one. “Rush club lax,” it read. 
Behind it, a maize-and-blue 
Michigan flag sat inside, 
unused until further notice.

Unused, too, were the steps 
to Revelli Hall, where the 
drum line typically 
performs, entertaining 
thousands as they walk to 
the stadium. Across the 
street, Elbel Field was fully 
populated by soccer players 
and frisbee throwers. On 
Saturday, they were the only 
people I saw, save for a 
family of three that stopped 
at the stadium gates to snap 
a picture, reveling in their 
own sadness. But even the 
populated locales are a 

strange sight. Typically, 
Elbel Field would be closed 
to everyone but marching 
band families — no one’s 
playing soccer on a football 
Saturday.
It’s strange what you notice 
without the crowds.
Next to the railroad tracks 
along Hoover Street, where 
that one tailgate with the 
big-screen TVs sets up on 
fall Saturdays, there’s a 
parking lot and a white brick 
warehouse. In dozens of 
walks down this street when 

football beckoned, I never 
noticed either. The ware-
house is an electrical supply 
store, according to Google. 
Next door, a sign says the 
Physical Properties Building 
sits. Before this weekend, it 
would have been ‘the 
building where t-shirt 
vendors set up’ if you had 
asked me.
At the end of Keech Avenue, 
Michigan Stadium is still 
there, but in concept only. It 
is, to everyone except 
players and team personnel, 
indefinitely inaccessible. 
There’s a peeling sign 
outside the northwest 
entrance that lists prohibited 
items. This year, it can be 
updated to include fans, 
even if football returns. 
Their absence allows for 
some new discoveries at the 
stadium, too. The student 
section entrance, apparently, 
is called Alumni Plaza — 
dedicated in 2001. All four 
corners of the stadium have 
their own plazas — Wolver-
ine, Champions and Varsity, 
if you’re curious.
The most important discov-
ery, though, was everything 
that we missed. We missed 
the debates over who should 
start at quarterback and if 
Jim Harbaugh should lose 
his job if Michigan can’t beat 
Ohio State. We missed the 
smell of spilled Natty Light 
and burgers on the grill. But 
most of all, we missed our 
friends and family and the 
memories we would have 
made together.
Because at the center of it 
all, Saturday afternoon in 
Ann Arbor missed the 
people.

‘Underrated’ Brad Hawkins stepping

into leadership role in secondary

A look into political contributions
from athletic department figures

Brad Hawkins is one of the 
most experienced players on 
Michigan’s defense. A senior 
two-year starter who’s missed 
just three games since 2017, 
Hawkins is one of the biggest 
sources of continuity on a team 
facing so much upheaval.
In the spring, defensive coordi-
nator Don Brown mentioned 
Hawkins among a select group 
of players he considered the 
leaders on the defense. Now 
that the Wolverines are back in 
Ann Arbor and have resumed 
practice, Hawkins has been 
able to fully step into that role.
“Becoming a leader on this 
defense, it means a lot to me,” 
Hawkins said on a Zoom call 
Friday. “I know I’m going to 
play a big role in the secondary 
and the defense period, just 
being a senior and being a 
leader and playing a lot and 
knowing what’s going on. That 
room has helped me a lot, 
growing as a person and as a 
man.”

But though Hawkins’ talent 
and 
experience 
isn’t 
in 

question, COVID-19 and the 
postponement of the Big Ten 
football season have left his 
status in flux. Like teammate 
Kwity Paye, Hawkins hasn’t 
yet made a formal decision on 
whether to play if a season is 
held this school year. Though 
Hawkins acknowledged that 
things could change quickly, 
he expressed a desire to play 
another season with Michigan.
“Honestly, I don’t know. I 
want to come back, I want 
to play another year here at 
the university,” he said. “Of 
course, there’s a lot of things 
that can change. But I want to 
come back and play with these 
guys, and hopefully I get that 
opportunity.”
One area where Hawkins’ 
leadership is key is with the 
development of sophomore 
safety Daxton Hill.
Hill showed promise last year, 
primarily as a backup safety and 
nickel corner as well as a gunner 
on special teams. He started 
three games at the end of the 

year when Hawkins went down 
with an undisclosed injury.
“That was a big loss to us at the 
end of the year,” Brown said 
May 22. “And it took Daxton 
Hill, who’s an excellent player, 
and put him into a role that, 
he had to change his role and 
obviously that was a very good 
experience for Daxton, but 
the overall play of our defense 
obviously 
gets 
impacted 

because you lose a player of 
Brad Hawkins’ stature.”
Now, instead of backing up 
Hawkins, Hill will likely start 
alongside him if there is a 
season. That means the two of 
them will work together more 
than ever.
Hawkins acknowledged Hill’s 
contributions at the end of 
last season and expressed 
confidence in their abilities as a 
unit.
“(Hill) got a lot bigger, a 
lot stronger, a lot smarter,” 
Hawkins said. “He’s definitely a 
guy to watch out for, of course. 
... He’s grown every single day. 
He’s looking real good. Both of 
us do a real good job of commu-
nicating with each other. I feel 
like we both cover really well. 
There’s versatility back there. 
Free safety, rover, it doesn’t 
really matter with both of us. 
Having him back there helps 
me a lot. With his athleticism 
and his smarts and his speed, it 
definitely helps a lot.”
Beyond COVID-19, uncertainty 
over the season and a new part-
ner at safety, Hawkins is also 
working with a new position 
coach in Bob Shoop, whose hire 
was announced in January after 
Chris Partridge left for Ole Miss.

As Election Day inches closer, 
the push to get people to vote 
intensifies 
every 
day. 
But 

behind the scenes and well 
before Nov. 3, individuals from 
all walks of life assert their 
political stance in another way: 
donations.
Any individual can donate an 
amount of their choosing up to 
a government-mandated limit 
either directly to campaigns, 
to PACs or to Super PACs. This 
is an individual’s right as a U.S. 
citizen, so, the University of 
Michigan does not infringe on 
that ability, and neither does 
the athletic department. 
Many 
athletics 
personnel 

donate to political campaigns, 
and information about their 
individual donations including 
amount, donation recipient, 
name of individual donor and 
employer are available on the 
Federal Election Commission 
website.

“Harbaugh” 
is 
the 
name 

that immediately jumps off 
the webpage. The donations 
coming from Jack, a former 
Michigan assistant coach, and 
Jacqueline “Jackie” Harbaugh 
— Jim and John’s parents 
— fill up all but one of the 
search results under the name. 
The only other was a $7.00 
contribution to ActBlue from 
James Harbaugh Jr.
Jack and Jackie’s donations 
weren’t of the same vein as 
James’. The two donated totals 
of $450 to Donald J. Trump 
for President Inc., $400 to the 
Donald Trump Make America 
Great Again Committee, $350 
to the Republican National 
Committee and $300 to John 
James for Senate over the past 
16 months.
Michigan football coach Jim 
Harbaugh hasn’t donated, per 
the FEC, but his entire team 
registered to vote last week.
As for current athletic person-
nel 
giving 
contributions, 

Michigan swim and dive coach 
Mike Bottom has donated on 

15 separate occasions within 
the past year to Donald Trump 
and WinRed, a republican 
PAC. Overall, Bottom gave 
$1,375 across the same 15 
donations, giving $75 each 
time to Donald J. Trump for 
President Inc. and $100 for 
each donation to a PAC or 
organization that supported 
him.
In smaller amounts, Michigan 
men’s gymnastics assistant 
coach Jordan Gaarenstroom 
gave $20 to WinRed last 
December, 
and 
Michigan 

cheerleading coach Pam St. 
John gave $53.50 across six 
donations to ActBlue.
The 
athletic 
department 

declined comment for this 
story.
Past these few, the FEC 
website produced nothing 
discernable 
about 
other 

athletic department persons’ 
donations, 
including 
no 

results found for either Jim 
Harbaugh or men’s basketball 
coach Juwan Howard. This 
doesn’t confirm either of 
them — or any Michigan 
athletic 
department 
staff 

— hasn’t donated, just that 
results do not come up under 
their name. They could be 
donating in other ways not 
identifiable by the individual 
contribution database, such 
as donating under the name 
of an LLC or alias, especially 
considering the wide-spread 
recent activism and sufficient 
wealth Michigan coaches and 
staff have available to them.
But with just over a month left, 
a few last minute donations 
could pop up, giving even 
greater 
insight 
into 
the 

political actions of people in 
Michigan athletics.

DANIEL DASH
Daily Sports Editor

Majdi Issa is no stranger to 
mentorship. As the youngest 
of seven children and owner 
of Ahmo’s Gyro and Deli in 
downtown Ann Arbor, he has 
18 nieces and nephews and a 
restaurant staff looking up to 
him.
Born and raised in Ann 
Arbor, Issa has always been a 
passionate Michigan sports 
fan. So when his cousin put 
him in touch with Chris 
Evans in February 2019, he 
immediately recognized the 
Michigan 
running 
back’s 

name.
At the time, Evans had just 
lost his spot on the football 
team due to an academic 
suspension. The ban came at 
a critical time in his career, 
as he appeared set to take 
over lead back duties for the 
Wolverines 
after 
totaling 

2,114 scrimmage yards across 
his first three seasons.
Instead of gearing up for his 
senior season, Evans found 
himself in the market for a 
job. He eventually found 
three — one at Ahmo’s, 
another as an early-morning 
carpenter and a third as a 
high school special teams 
coordinator for Ann Arbor 
Huron. As Evans grappled 
with the realities of his 
suspension, Issa offered him 
work as a delivery driver and 
dishwasher at Ahmo’s.
“He just wanted to get every-
thing back on track,” Issa told 
The Daily. “He was always on 
time and worked hard. Very 
positive, always optimistic 
and always had a smile on his 
face.”
Even when Michigan coach 
Jim 
Harbaugh 
announced 

Evans would be reinstated 
for the 2020 season last 
November, Evans continued 
working at Ahmo’s until the 
onset 
of 
the 
COVID-19 

pandemic. In total, he spent 
just over a year at the restau-

rant. 
Evans 
developed 
a 

relationship with Issa that 
ran 
deeper 
than 
his 

day-to-day duties, and even-
tually, beyond the walls of 
the deli itself.
“He was also helping every-
one manage and overlooked 
everything,” Issa said. “I put 
a lot of trust in him and he 
delivered. … Even other than 
working here, he would do 
some side work with me as 
well. He was always hustling, 
just trying to stay afloat.
“I tried to help him in the 
right direction when it came 
to schooling, helping him 
structure his classes and his 
homework and how to take 
priority. He came a long 
way.”
***
As winter turned to spring, 
Evans held out hope that he’d 
be eligible to play during the 
2019 
season. 
He 
wasn’t 

enrolled at Michigan, let 
alone on a football scholar-
ship, yet his appeal remained 
under review as the Wolver-
ines began spring practices. 
But in June, a report surfaced 
that 
Evans’s 
suspension 

would 
last 
through 
the 

football season.
“Mentally, it was tough not 
knowing if you were ever 
going to be able to play 
football again at Michigan,” 
Evans said in a Zoom call 
with reporters Friday. “That 
was the big question as I got 
closer to the end of the 
school year in November. … I 
went the whole year without 
100 percent knowing if I was 
coming back or not. It wasn’t 
my choice. It was coach 
Harbaugh’s and the school’s 
to let me back in and if I was 
going to be on scholarship. I 
just stuck to what I knew and 
grinded all the time.”
During his suspension, Evans 
began working out at Huron’s 
field to stay in shape. There, 
he crossed paths with Antai-
wn 
Mack, 
the 
school’s 

first-year 
head 
football 

coach. They swapped cell 
phone numbers, and when 
they 
reconnected 
a 
few 

months later, Mack agreed to 
bring Evans on board as his 
special teams coordinator.
“He felt he could contribute 
at a high level because he 
learned a lot of special teams 
at Michigan,” Mack told The 
Daily. “One of the things that 
stood out to me was, no 
matter what type of player 
you were, Chris Evans always 
wanted to coach guys up. 
Guys 
that 
were 
average 

players, not so good, he 
always worked on developing 

kids and developing relation-
ships with the kids.
“He was able to do whatever 
I needed him to do. He was 
always 
willing 
to 
learn, 

always worked hard, always 
coached the kids with high 
energy.”
During the fall — more than 
six months after the begin-
ning of his suspension — 
Evans worked as a carpenter 
from daybreak until noon 
before coaching at Huron in 
the afternoon. Afterward, he 
spent about four hours at 
Ahmo’s delivering and wash-
ing dishes. 

At Huron, Evans led daily 
special 
teams 
practices, 

prepared game plans and 
assembled scouting reports. 
Most importantly, though, 
the school became a place 
where 
Evans 
could 
both 

mentor and be mentored. His 
arrival 
paid 
immediate 

dividends, and in his first 
game coaching special teams, 
Huron snapped its five-year, 
39-game losing streak with a 
63-14 victory.
Throughout Huron’s season, 
Evans and Mack formed a 
close relationship. And as 
Mack began to open up about 

his own past, Evans did the 
same. 
“I would talk to him about 
things and share hardships 
that happened in my life,” 
Mack said. “And he would 
share some of the things 
about being without football, 
how it made him feel and 
what he needed to work on to 
get back. We shared things, 
and as I shared more of my 
story, it was encouraging for 
him as well.”
One Saturday, as the Michi-
gan football team took the 
field, Mack brought up the 
elephant in the room, asking 

how the suspended Evans 
felt 
about 
missing 
what 

would’ve been his senior 
season.
“I’m sad, but I’m rooting for 
my 
guys,” 
Mack 
recalled 

Evans 
telling 
him. 
“I’m 

rooting for the guys starting 
at my position. I want to see 
them do well. I want to see 
them develop. And if I get a 
chance to come back, I just 
want to compete at a high 
level and be prepared for 
those guys to get better.”
Added Mack: “(Evans) was 
always positive about his 
situation, 
even 
when 
he 

wasn’t playing. That showed 
me his true character.”
***
In November, nine months 
after Evans’s original suspen-
sion and removal from the 
team, Harbaugh announced 
he would be reinstated for 
the 2020 season.
For 
Evans, 
the 
formal 

announcement marked the 
culmination of a year of 
uncertainty. Even more than 
that, it was a validation of his 
hard work. Now back on 
scholarship, 
everything 

about the hundreds of hours 
he spent working odd jobs to 
stay afloat are in the past.
That is, everything but the 
lasting 
relationships 
and 

perspective they gave him.
While away from the Wolver-
ines, Evans’ jobs opened his 
eyes to realities he’d never 
considered. Perhaps most of 
all, it shined light on the 
value 
of 
his 
eventual 

reinstatement.
“I felt like there were some 
older high school coaches on 
the (Huron) staff that wished 
they 
could 
play 
football 

again, trying to hype kids up, 
get them going,” Evans said. 
“They 
knew 
that 
they 

couldn’t 
play 
again. 
I 

watched that, and I was like, 
‘I get the luxury and might be 
able to play again.
“So I’m going to make sure 
that when I get my opportu-

nity, I’m going to make the 
most of it.’ ”
For 
Michigan, 
Evans’s 

reinstatement 
will 
add 

another dimension to an 
offense that already returns 
its two leading rushers from 
last season. Evans will be 
greeted 
by 
an 
offensive 

scheme drastically different 
from the one he left, but he 
projects as a great fit for 
second-year 
offensive 

coordinator 
Josh 
Gattis’s 

up-tempo system. Address-
ing the media earlier this 
spring, 
Michigan 
running 

backs coach Jay Harbaugh 
mentioned Evans has shown 
interest in the details of the 
game, adding that his passion 
and personality have driven 
him to ask extra questions.
In Schembechler Hall, Evans’ 
teammates have welcomed 
him back with open arms.
“We all know he’s a great 
guy,” senior safety Brad Haw-
kins said on a Zoom call with 
reporters Friday. “We all 
know he’s a great football 
player. The mental toughness 
that he has, being away from 
the team for a year, getting 
his mind right, doing the 
things that he had to do and 
coming back this year, being 
a leader and stepping up, that 
says a lot about him as a 
person and the character that 
he has. He’s a great guy and 
definitely somebody that I 
look up to.”
With a productive senior 
season, Evans could play his 
way up NFL draft boards. He 
currently ranks No. 50 on 
ESPN analyst Todd McShay’s 
list of top 2021 NFL Draft 
prospects, which translates 
to a second-round selection.
Regardless of his NFL Draft 
status, the next time Evans 
puts on a winged helmet will 
be a reflection of his own 
journey. For that, and what-
ever comes next, he’ll have 
his battle-tested work ethic 
and people like Issa and 
Mack in his corner.

He was able to do

whatever I needed him to do.

He was always willing
to learn, always worked
hard, always coached the

kids with high energy.
