On Monday, The Michigan 

Daily sat down for an interview 
with E. Royster Harper, the 
University of Michigan’s vice 
president of Student Life. During 
a time of national conversations 
surrounding 
many 
important 

and polarizing issues, we asked 
Harper for her take on current 
Greek 
life 
reforms, 
sexual 

assault and misconduct, and free 
speech in the context of white 
supremacist Richard Spencer’s 
possible visit to campus next 
semester.

Greek Life
In November, Greek life at 

the 
University 
of 
Michigan 

experienced a social ban under 
“claims of sexual misconduct 
cases 
involving 
fraternity 

brothers, six incidents of reported 
hazing … multiple allegations of 
drugging members in undisclosed 
fraternity chapters and three 
specific hazing allegations … 
where 
fraternity 
members 

were put in alleged near-death 
situations,” according to fraternity 
leaders at a closed meeting 
attended by The Daily.

After the social ban was 

lifted, an action-oriented model 
for Greek life was established, 
hoping to turn Greek life into 
a less dangerous environment 
for participants. According to E. 
Royster Harper, vice president for 
Student Life, the Dean of Students 

Office, in partnership with the 
Director of Greek life, has been 
taking 
measures 
to 
improve 

community standards such as 
providing 
sexual 
misconduct 

training and implementing a 
position between Greek life and 
the Ginsberg Center.

“We’ve been trying through 

education, through training, a 
little bit of persuasion and then 
some concrete structural changes 
like adding positions, really trying 

to get the community to really 
rethink its culture and recommit 
to a culture that reflects its value,” 
Harper said.

More recently, members of 

Greek life attended a weekend 
retreat, 
Harper 
said, 
where 

topics of social responsibility 
and community values were 
discussed. She explained the 
most important part of the Greek 
life reform process has been to 
establish a partnership with 

students, rather than to regulate 
or direct students.

“The challenge I face is 

that none of us, including the 
Greek community, want the 
things that are unhealthy in the 
community to continue … On 
the other hand, we don’t want 
to talk about the community as 
though there’s nothing good in 
the community,” Harper said. 
“I am both encouraged by their 

Monday, the University of 

Michigan’s 
Senate 
Advisory 

Committee on Undergraduate 
Affairs took their weekly meeting 
to the Medical School to talk 
about academics at the Medical 
School with Carol Bradford, 
the Medical School’s executive 
vice dean for Academic Affairs 
and Michigan Medicine’s Chief 
Academic Officer.

Bradford, 
who 
got 
her 

undergraduate, 
master’s 
and 

medical degrees at the University, 
began by talking to the body 
about what she is doing in her role 
as Vice Dean of Academic Affairs, 
which she began in July 2016.

The previous chair of the 

Otolaryngology 
Department, 

Bradford is one of three executive 
vice deans at the Medical School 
— she is in charge of the school’s 
academic mission, while her 
colleagues control the clinical 
and research sectors of the 
school.

faculty and all learners, which

In collaboration with Chicago 

and Denver-based Peers Health, 
an organization aiming to reform 
workforce case management and 
help workers get back to their 
jobs after illness or injury, the 
University of Michigan is currently 
working on a two-year research 
project with the goal of optimizing 
health care plans and return-to-
work times for employees on injury 
or sick leave. 

Currently, organizations like 

Peers Health are finding strong 
relationships between a worker’s 
ability to perform their job’s 
duties and their overall well-being 
and health. By improving this 
healthcare 
infrastructure, 
the 

University and Peers Health are 
hoping to increase productivity in 
hospitals, insurance companies, 
offices and more.

According to Brian Denton, 

an Industrial and Operations 
Engineering professor, who is 
one of the principal investigators 
of the project along with Jenna 
Wiens, 
assistant 
professor 

of 
computer 
science 
and

will 

choose one organization to 
bestow this grant upon each 
month. With this grant, Lyft 
aims to support the work 
of 
these 
organizations 
by 

helping with transportation 
difficulties.

In a press statement shared 

with The Daily, Lyft stated its 
goal of building relationships 
with groups with important 
missions in the Ann Arbor 
community.

“As an active member of the 

greater Ann Arbor business 
community, Lyft is excited 
to 
continue 
strengthening 

partnerships 
with 
local 

organizations 
that 
are 

doing important work in the 
community,” it states.

Any nonprofit or student 

group from the University of 
Michigan, Eastern Michigan 
University,

Erica James grapples with personal Southern ties in monument conservation

Erica 
Caple 
James, 
MIT 

associate professor of medical 
anthropology and urban studies, 
discussed 
the 
importance 

of 
historical 
preservation 
of 

monuments and sites and their 
implications in modern society 
in to more than 50 students and 
faculty Monday afternoon in a talk 
titled “The Matter of Black Lives: 
Hauntology, Infrastructure, and 
the Necropolitics of History in the 

American South.”

James’s talk is part of a 

larger series led by the Science, 
Technology, 
Medicine 
and 

Society Colloquium Series at the 
University of Michigan.

Rackham 
student 
Vicky 

Koski-Karell, an event facilitator, 
introduced James as well as the 
series and its mission for students.

“This 
is 
basically 
an 

opportunity 
to 
bring 
faculty 

from across the country and also 
from within the University that 
are doing work related to the 
study of science, technology and 

society and just highlight their 
research, have a space to try out 
new ideas, and really provide an 
interdisciplinary space where we 
can engage in the advancement of 
knowledge,” Koski-Karell said.

James 
began 
her 
talk 

with a brief summary of the 
theory 
surrounding 
historical 

monuments and sites, discussing 
interconnectedness of race, land 
and infrastructure development. 
She described the concept of 
necropolitics 
and 
hauntology, 

ideas that, according to James, 
explain the power of death and its 

impact on society.

James specifically cited the 

example 
of 
the 
Confederate 

General 
Robert 
E. 
Lee 

monument 
in 
New 
Orleans, 

which was removed last year. 
She said infrastructure in cities 
convey values of a society, both 
symbolically and materially.

“Infrastructure 
projects, 

whether public or private, often 
reveal the social and political 
values of a society, and are 
addressed to the public in ways 
that can manifest the power of the

we sometimes call residents or 
trainees,” Bradford said. “We’re 
also extremely committed to 
faculty development, so I think 
we’re all learners because we’re 
all striving to improve.”

Strategic planning for the 

department has been a priority 
of Bradford’s since she took 
the position. She and her team 
created five “pillars”— education, 
people, 
discovery, 
care 
and 

service— that now guide the 
academic mission of the Medical 
School.

“We came up with this mission 

and strategic framework, which 
is that the University of Michigan 
Medical School will transform 
health 
through 
bold 
and 

innovative education, discovery 
and service, and we’ll do that in 
a vibrant and inclusive learning 
community, 
with 
enabling 

resources and infrastructure,” 

Bradford told the body.

Bradford then opened the 

conversation 
up 
to 
SACUA, 

asking for their suggestions on 
how to best engage with the 
community and improve their 
overall strategic plan.

SACUA 
vice 
chair 
Ruth 

Carlos, professor of radiology, 
mentioned different strategies 
may work better in different 
situations. More sensitive topics 
like conversations on diversity, 
race and equity require different 
outreach methods, as people 
are often more reluctant to talk 
about them.

“I believe it’s contextual,” 

Carlos said. “What we want to 
share, and the information we’d 
like to get back really depends 
on the topic and the sensitivity 
of the topic … It’s challenging 
to come up with a single 
recommendation and in many 
instances, the stakeholders we’d 
like to engage don’t know they’re 
stakeholders. They don’t know 
they can be engaged.”

Bradford agreed, sharing that 

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
efforts have been very robust 
at the Medical School. Each 
department within the school 
has a diversity unit, and implicit 
bias has been a major target of 
these units recently. According 
to Bradford, over 6,000 members 
of Michigan Medicine have done 
unconscious bias training.

This 
segued 
into 
a 

conversation 
about 
wellness 

and civility among the Medical 
School 
community. 
Wellness 

is a growing concern among 
academic medical centers, and 
something Bradford and her 
team have been paying close 
attention to in the past year and 
a half.

“Our goal is to prevent and 

protect against burn out in the 
workplace environment, and it’s 
really for the entire workforce, 
we really wanted to make sure 
that there was nobody that was 
not included,” Bradford said. 

When Bradford opened the 

conversation to suggestions 
from 
the 
Committee 

again, SACUA member Joy 
Beatty, associate professor 
of management studies at 
U-M Dearborn, asked how 
the Medical School was 
addressing issues of civility 
in their community.

“Civility is how we treat 

each other, and wellness 
is ‘are we well,’” Bradford 
clarified. “So when we began 
to put them together, we 
thought, perhaps correctly 
or incorrectly, that lack of 
civility could be related to 
lack of wellness. And I think 
where we’re thinking right 
now is that there is overlap, 
but they’re two separate 
issues, so we need wellness 
tactics and we need separate 
civility tactics.”

SACUA member Stefan 

Szymanski, 
professor 

of 
kinesiology, 
steered 

the 
conversation 
back 

to 
wellness, 
saying 
the 

pressure to always be one 
of “the leaders and best” 
might contribute to a faculty 
burnout at the University.

“We talk about being victors, 

leaders, the best and I think for 
many people that can create 
discontinuity,” 
Szymanski 

said. “People don’t get up every 
morning feeling like a victor, a 
leader or the best, necessarily, 
and 
our 
expectations 
are 

constantly saying ‘this is what 
we are.’ I think that places a lot of 
stress on individuals.”

But 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 

Bradford said she found through 
her research that meaning and 
purpose could be an antidote to 
lack of wellness in a community.

“If you come to work and 

make a positive difference in 
the lives of patients, families, 
the organization, whatever it 
is, that actually can be a really 
good prevention and help you 
maintain and keep wellness,” 
Bradford said. “But I think what 
you’re referencing is we can’t 
all be superstars, so it’s about 
making room in the organization 
for everyone to make a positive 
impact and a difference, and 
when things are not going well, 
what resources are available.”

The Committee rounded out 

the discussion with a question 
from 
SACUA 
member 
Neil 

Marsh, professor of biological 
chemistry. Marsh wanted to 
know how Bradford viewed the 
relationship between the basic 
science departments and the 
clinical 
science 
departments, 

and how she plans to improve it. 
He said he has felt a large divide 
between the two disciplines at 
the University.

Bradford, 
the 
previous 

chair of the Department of 
Otolaryngology, which housed 
the Kresge Hearing Institute, a 
basic sciences department, has 
spent many years trying to foster 
the relationship between the 
two groups. She said she hasn’t 
yet found a perfect answer to 
Marsh’s question.

“Our 
teams 
are 
working 

very hard to hold (the two) 
together,” Bradford said. “It’s an 
opportunity and a challenge … 
I think we need to find forums 
and avenues for meaningful 
collaboration 
and 
win-win 

situations.”

own self-monitoring in saying that 
we need to stop the social activities 
because of all this going on, and 
that also frightens me because my 
experience has been when we self-
correct, things are sometimes more 
dangerous than we know.”

In addition, Harper spoke on 

multicultural 
fraternities 
and 

sororities, specifically surrounding 
issues 
of 
police 
presence. 
In 

October, The Daily reported a 
disparity between the large amount 
of Black and Latino fraternity police 
citations and the low amount of 
police activity at predominantly 
white fraternities on MSU gameday 
weekend.

Harper said the disparity is one 

that mirrors national conversations 
on overpolicing and concerns the 
differences between Greek life 
organizations and private homes.

“The same behavior in front of a 

white Greek letter organization gets 
an entirely different response than if 
it’s a private home and there are lots 
of students of color,” Harper said. 
“That is an ongoing challenge for us 
as a university and as a community 
as we work with our students 
because they notice the difference, 
we notice the difference.”

Many students also feel a 

lost 
connection 
between 
the 

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
planand Greek life. While Harper 
explained the difficulties in finding 
solutions to the issue, specifically 
for those often “overpoliced and 
underprotected,” she spoke of the 
importance in continuing to engage 
in 
conversations 
surrounding 

the issue and in strengthening 
relationships 
between 
different 

communities.

“I think what public safety 

officers are trying to do is to ensure 
public safety,” Harper said. “I think 
what students experience is, ‘But 
your response to ensuring that is 
different depending on how people 
look,’ and that’s true — that’s the 
national conversation. We just have 
to continue to do this work.”

Student Life Support
In 
terms 
of 
initiatives 

undertaken by Student Life, Harper 
first spoke on sexual assault, a topic 
that has become especially relevant 

as allegations are made against 
men in power around the nation 
and in Hollywood, as well as at 
the University of Michigan. Most 
recently, the trial of Larry Nassar, 
a former Michigan State University 
and USA Gymnastics doctor who 
received 40 to 175 years for sex 
abuse, has sparked a larger sexual 
assault conversation among higher 
education institutions.

At 
the 
University, 
Harper 

explained through strengthening 
and improving staff at the Sexual 
Assault Prevention and Awareness 
Center 
and 
Counseling 
and 

Psychological Services, the Student 
Life 
administration 
has 
been 

working to change the dialogue 
surrounding sexual assault, so that 
rather than focusing all efforts on 
the punishment of perpetrators, 
more efforts are directed toward 
increasing 
and 
advocating 
for 

the reporting process through 
educational efforts.

“What we’re really talking about 

is a culture change,” Harper said. 
“The narrative has been around 
punishment. ‘Why wasn’t the guy 
punished, why wasn’t the guy 
stopped, who knew when?’ What 
we want to focus on is, certainly, 
when it occurs [to] have a strong 
adjudication process … But we 
really want our efforts to be around 
education and training.”

She explained the administration 

has looked over assessment data 
and surveys around sexual assault 
at the University, researching the 
reasons students may not report 
incidents of sexual misconduct and 
determining ways to strengthen 
training 
programs 
so 
as 
to 

encourage and improve reporting.

“We want to be effective in 

repairing harm and adjudicating, 
but the real goal for us is to not have 
it happen, and when it does, to have 
the kind of community where our 
students will come forward, know 
that they will be believed, and know 
then that we will work to resolve in 
a fair and equitable way what has 
happened,” Harper said.

While 
the 
encouragement 

of students to come forward 
with 
allegations 
is 
important, 

Harper highlighted the duties of 
those within her own office to 
act on allegations and to ensure 
investigations are handled properly.

“The President has been very 

explicit with all of us that the buck 
stops with us,” Harper said. “His 
expectation is that staff in Student 
Life are trained, that they are 
reporting and that I am acting when 
I hear something. That has always 
been the expectation, but he sort of 
turned up the volume.”

In explaining the efforts of the 

Office of Student Life in improving 
training and education, Harper 
also emphasized giving voices 
to survivors — something that 
becomes especially important in 
times when countless individuals 
come forward. She expanded on 
her commitment to ensuring all 
students, staff and faculty recognize 
their right to be present at the 
University free of the possibility of 
sexual assault and misconduct.

“Part of the reason why we have 

to be so vigilant now is because 
imagine you come out of high 
school, you come to college, you 
sort of learn in college (to) put up 
with it — why wouldn’t you go into 
a career and put up with it?” Harper 
said. “So in some ways, we’re hoping 
that if we are just focused and really 
get this culture right, it will then 
ricochet (as you go) into a career and 
you say no.”

Spencer delays
On the topic of a potential visit 

from white supremacist Richard 
Spencer next semester and the 
current 
issues 
surrounding 

free speech on campus, Harper 
addressed the removal request 
of 
biology 
professor 
John 

Vandermeer’s “Black Lives Matter” 
sign from his office window two 
weeks ago.

Harper 
acknowledged 
the 

University’s request to remove the 
sign was a mistake. However, she 
emphasized if it was purposeful, the 
University would be contradicting 
its own position on free speech — 
especially since it is the basis for 
allowing someone like Spencer on 
campus.

“If the taking down of the 

sign was based on content then 
we’re talking out of both sides 
of our mouth because we have a 
commitment to free speech, and it’s 
everybody’s free speech,” Harper 
said. “It’s Richard Spencer’s free 
speech, and Black Lives Matters’s 
free speech.”

Harper furthered this sentiment 

and said the power of free speech 

lies in the fact that it belongs to 
everyone.

“There is a strong commitment, 

there 
is 
an 
unwavering 

commitment to free speech, and 
that’s everybody’s,” Harper said. 
“That means that (Spencer) can 
come, and I can protest his coming. 
He can say swear words, and so 
can I. That’s the power of the right 
to speak. It applies to everyone. 
Though 
sometimes 
we 
would 

rather not hear what the person 
is saying because it’s so offensive 
or racist or homophobic, they still 
have the right to say it. (However, 
Vandermeer) has the right the put 
up the sign.”

She also warned of the danger 

that not standing true to the idea 
that everyone has the right to 
voice their opinions can lead to 
the University coming across as 
insincere.

“There can’t be two standards 

for free speech without us being 
hypocritical as an institution,” 
Harper said.

Harper also addressed the topic 

of student housing and the added 
financial 
burden 
it 
continues 

to place on students each year. 
According to the U.S. Census 
Bureau, Ann Arbor’s median rate 
for rent increased 14 percent from 
2010 to 2015 — lying at $1,075 
as of the last survey. As the Vice 
President of Student Life, Harper 
is in charge of the Beyond the Diag 
initiative, which helps students find 
off-campus housing.

Harper explained while the 

University 
cannot 
control 
the 

prices of off-campus entities, there 
are discussions taking place about 
refurbishing existing on-campus 
housing options and even building 
new ones altogether.

“One of the ways we’ve been 

thinking about it is, is there 
something we can do in terms of 
additional housing for students, and 
how do we repair and replace what 
is here so students want to live on 
campus and should we be thinking 
about additional housing?” Harper 
said. “We can control that cost in 
a way that we can’t control the 
market.”

LSA senior Julia Berg, a 

volunteer 
co-coordinator 

for 
SAPAC’s 
Bystander 

Intervention and Community 
Engagement 
program, 
said 

the Lyft partnership was a 
success in terms of helping 
students and other members 
of the community becoming 
more aware of how to be better 
bystanders.

“It was a cool partnership 

we had with them, and we’re 
hoping to keep using those 
Lyft passes to demonstrate that 
Lyft is still partnering with us 

and that we can still be better 
bystanders,” Berg said.

Berg was unsure of how often 

SAPAC uses transportation on 
an organizational level, but 
thought they could perhaps use 
the grant to collaborate with 
other student organizations.

“Within BICE, we’ve done 

a 
lot 
with 
the 
bystander 

intervention part of our name, 
and we’re working more on 
the 
community 
engagement 

part,” Berg said. “So hopefully 
we can find ways to work with 
other groups on campus that 
could potentially use this as a 
resource. Or maybe there’s some 
sort of collaborative event that 
could use this type of funding.”

Berg 
also 
said 
she’d 
be 

interested in using the grant 
to continue providing students 
with late-night Lyft passes.

“We 
didn’t 
actually 
give 

out all of the passes we got 
from Lyft, but we’re hoping to 
give more out at workshops,” 
Berg said. “If the funding 
could be used in that capacity, 
I think that would be a cool 
opportunity.”

For 
organizations 
like 

The 
Detroit 
Partnership, 
a 

University student group that 
aims to get students involved 
in the Detroit area, Lyft’s 
grant 
could 
be 
especially 

helpful. Business senior Arjun 
Kaushal, 
finance 
director 

of The Detroit Partnership, 
discussed the group’s reliance 
on transportation to achieve 
their mission. He said the group 
mainly uses Zipcar to transport 
students 
for 
their 
weekly 

programs and buses for their 
major events.

Kaushal said Lyft’s program 

is something the organization 
would 
probably 
look 
into, 

but noted how quickly they 
would run through the $1,000 
due to how often they need 
transportation.

“It’s obviously of interest 

to us; it’s in our target space 
as it’s targeting communities 
in Ann Arbor and Detroit,” 
Kaushal said. “In terms of the 

$1,000, if I was going to use 
Lyft to go to Detroit, one way 
is around 50 bucks. For us, as 
an organization, we’d use it up 
pretty quickly.”

Kaushal 
also 
said 
he 

recognized 
the 
benefits 
of 

this grant and a continuing 
partnership with Lyft.

“From what I hear, Lyft is 

generally good about factoring 
in social change and positive 
change in their mission and 
their 
company’s 
fabric,” 

Kaushal 
said. 
“Functionally, 

there’s definitely value to be 
had there for us in getting our 
members down to the city.”

In an email interview, Elliot 

Darvick, 
the 
general 
Lyft 

manager of Detroit, said the 
positive 
drive 
demonstrated 

by students at the University 
motivated Lyft to extend the 
Community Grant Program to 
Ann Arbor. He also expressed 
his excitement in seeing what 
these organizations will achieve 
with the help of the grant.

“Knowing that U-M students 

and the community surrounding 
them are equally driven to 
create a better world inspired 
us to bring the grant program 
to Ann Arbor,” Darvick wrote. 
“I’m eager to see the great 
work that organizations in our 
community are able to do with 
access to Lyft’s safe, reliable, 
and convenient rides.”

The fallout from scandals of 

sex abuse by disgraced doctor 
Larry Nassar at Michigan State 
University and as a member of 
the USA Gymnastics medical 
team 
have 
had 
innumerable 

ripple effects at the University 
of Michigan. The Daily spoke to 
women’s gymnastics coach Bev 
Plocki, in her 29th season on 
campus as one of the winningest 
coaches in the country, about 
this “moment of reckoning” for 
her team and the gymnastics 
community.

The Michigan Daily: How is 

your team feeling, after the trial 
and sentencing and survivors 
coming forward?

Plocki: The reality of this 

situation is that it’s so incredibly 
widespread. Everyone on our 
team, in our entire gymnastics 
community has been affected by it. 
Everybody knows at least someone 
who has been a victim. We’re all 
deeply saddened by what’s gone on 
and what these victims have had to 
say. We really hope, now, that since 

it’s over and since — I don’t even 
know what to call him, I certainly 
won’t call him Dr. Nassar—he’ll be 
gone for good, I hope everyone will 
be able to move on and heal. It’s the 
amount of support that is out there 
that’s the light at the end of a really 
dark tunnel. It has strengthened 
the community and bond between 
these athletes that are behind 
everyone affected.

TMD: How do I know that what 

happened at MSU won’t happen 
here?

Plocki: I think that we’re doing 

everything in our power … I mean 
the reality of the answer is that 
we can’t issue any guarantees. But 
for myself personally, I have tried 
very hard—and my athletes know 
this—to create a culture of open 
communication. They know my 
cell phone is on 24 hours a day, it’s 
by my bed, if they need me at two 
o’clock in the morning, I’ll be there. 
We’ve created that culture of 
encouraging them to come forward 
no matter what it is. My place is to 
be there for them, to make them 
feel safe, and to care. But I won’t 
overstep my boundaries.

TMD: This is year 29 now for 

you at the University, and many 

of the survivors we heard at the 
trial spoke about three decades of 
abuse. What kinds of things have 
you seen in your time here?

Plocki: I would never speak 

publicly about anyone’s issue, but 
I can tell you in 29 years, we’ve 
dealt with a lot of things, from 
personal tragedy to homesickness 
to something that’s happened in 
childhood or after. We can’t prevent 
people 
from 
having 
personal 

traumatic events, especially if they 
don’t have anything to do with 
their time at the University. But we 
have plans in place to help anybody 
that comes forward, with anything 
they might be dealing with.

TMD: Did you know him? How 

well?

Plocki: Who didn’t know him? 

I know he did his undergraduate 
work here at Michigan, but beyond 
that, I didn’t know him here. I 
would not classify him as a friend, 
but he was acquaintances with 
everybody in our world. He was 
all over the place, so you’d run 
into him here, there, and he was 
always a very friendly person. That 
was part of his grooming, he was 
very kind, giving, accommodating. 
Other than seeing him in other 

venues … It makes me very happy 
to say we’ve never utilized his 
services 
or 
referred 
student-

athletes to him. We utilize our own 
training staff.

TMD: Another 
wrinkle 
in 

this story is Michigan State’s 
involvement in the case, that 
officials created a culture that 
enabled this abuse and assault. 
What kinds of conversations have 
you been in among coaches, or in 
the Big Ten?

Plocki: We’re in the middle 

of our season, and so it’s not a 
pleasant thing for anyone to pick 
up the phone and speak about. 
I can only speak to our policies 
and procedures here, and it’s not 
appropriate for me to speak for 
anyone else. All I can really say 
is that Mr. Nassar was a master 
manipulator, and the number of 
children and young women that he 
fooled, the number of adults—be it 
parents or colleagues—it amazes 
me. I don’t know the specifics of 
any of that, so I’m not comfortable 
pointing fingers or placing blame.

state, and shape the subjectivity 
of those that design, fabricate, 
test, and ultimately use such 
systems,” James said.

James 
continued 
by 

describing her personal mission 
in discovering her ancestry to 
Jesse Scott Sammons, a public 
figure in Charlottesville, Va. 
towards the end of the 19th 
century. His previous familial 
homestead and cemetery were 
in danger of being paved over 
by a highway plan initiated 
by the Virginia Department 
of Transportation under the 
principle of eminent domain. 
After being traced to Sammons, 
she 
was 
asked 
by 
local 

historians to participate in the 
battle to preserve the land and 
its historical sites.

She described her initial 

reluctance in becoming involved 
with the project, not knowing 
exactly what obligations she 
owed the Sammons homestead, 
or how culturally significant 
this battle truly was.

“Taking on the fight meant 

embracing kinship with, and 
connections to, persons and 
troubling histories that have 
haunted my family, Virginia, 
and the United States, for more 
than two centuries,” James 
said.

James 
revealed 
after 
a 

lengthy struggle with legality 

and 
questionable 
legitimacy 

of the historical site, the battle 
ended in her favor, the team of 
historians and other ancestors 
of the Sammons family. The 
debate was reviewed by the 
Advisory Council on Historic 
Preservation, which deemed 
not only the Sammons cemetery 
and homestead were historically 
relevant, but also the remaining 
27 acres were eligible to receive 
federal protections.

Despite 
this 
success, 

James questioned the overall 
accomplishment 
of 
the 

preservation and respect of the 
history of people of color and 
the losing battles in many other 
Southern states.

“Whose history is deemed 

important and what are the 
criteria?” James said. 

Rackham student Kathryn 

Berringer 
expressed 
her 

excitement for future talks 
within the STeMS series and 
said the opportunity to be a 
part of this STS collaboration 
can widen the scope of the 
concentration and bring the 
dialogue to other parts of 
campus.

“The series and the program 

itself provides a chance to bring 
together 
faculty, 
graduate 

students and undergrad from 
around the University campus, 
to 
then 
engage 
with 
the 

speakers who are coming in and 
speaking to questions relevant 
to STS from many different 
fields,” Berringer said.

be applying several research 
methods, such as algorithmic 
investigations 
and 
statistical 

tests, to a comprehensive data 
set 
of 
anonymous 
workers’ 

compensation cases.

“What we want to do from that 

data is try to learn what works 
well and what doesn’t work well 
using data science approaches, 
so algorithmic approaches, for 
learning what decisions are likely 
to lead to somebody being able 
to get back to work in a safe and 
timely manner,” Denton said.

The research will use deep 

reinforcement machine learning, 
along 
with 
statistical 
and 

industrial operations methods, to 
create a model for how a patient 
can be treated for injury or illness 
and when they can return to 
work.

Rackham 
student 
Haozhu 

Wang, who is leading the student 
research 
group 
collaborating 

on the project, said the wealth 
of data the project has to work 
from will benefit the project 
immensely.

“This data set that we are 

going to work with is really 
kind of novel,” Wang said. “It’s 
a huge data set which contains 
the information of one million 
patients … To my knowledge, this 
is the largest data set by far (to be 
analyzed by machine learning).”

Wang also noted this is some of 

the first research using machine 
reinforcement learning, which 
investigates data sets through 
trial-and-error as a human often 
would, that looks at occupational 
healthcare.

Peers 
Health 
CEO 
Jon 

Seymour said the focus on 
return-to-work data is relatively 
new in occupational health data 
analysis as well.

“The focus of the data set 

is 
return-to-work, 
which 
is 

specifically how to get patients 
back to work from injuries and 
illnesses,” Seymour said. “It’s 
an important facet of medicine 
that is often underappreciated 
… Getting someone back to 
work from an injury or illness is 
equivalent to returning them to 

their productive endeavors.”

Seymour said the decision to 

work with University researchers 
was based on the advanced 
technological power, such as 
Mcity and the highest amount 
of research and development 
spending out of all public U.S. 
universities, 
and 
knowledge 

available.

“Here, 
these 
technologies, 

like artificial intelligence, are so 
cutting edge that the more we 
looked at it, the more we felt, to get 
the most out of it, we needed an 
academic component,” Seymour 
said. “These technologies are the 
ones that will eventually parallel 
a self-driving car, (they will) be 
able to actually interpret data and 
develop a policy around what to 
do in a given situation, and make 
proactive recommendations to 
doctors and other stakeholders.”

Denton reiterated Seymour’s 

self-driving vehicles example, 
saying 
the 
technology 
and 

research in artificial intelligence 
can apply to the research and data 
procedure the University and 
Peers will be working on with 
worker injuries through creating 
the 
deep 
learning 
research 

networks that rely on artificial 
intelligence to synthesize the 
data.

“Self-driving 
vehicles 
are 

trying to learn over time to 
become more and more effective 
using data they collect from 
multiple sources, and in a way 
that’s exactly what we’re trying 
to do here with the data that 
Peers is providing — many 
different sources of data that we 
bring together to build learning 
algorithms to improve upon 
decision making,” Denton said.

Seymour acknowledged there 

is 
considerable 
commercial 

interest going into this research 
— Peers Health develops and 
sells guidelines in the return-
to-work industry — and he said 
he believes the research has the 
potential to go even farther into 
the health care field.

“The implications of what we’ll 

learn here go beyond the niche 
of occupational health care and 
really extend broadly to general 
health care, and potentially every 
medical episode that goes on all 
day, every day,” Seymour said.

O

ver 
the 
past 
year, 

I’ve seen a dramatic 
shift 
in 
reputable 

journalistic outlets’ — like 
The New York Times, the 
Wall Street Journal and The 
Washington Post — coverage 
of the presidency to what 
individuals might perceive as 
being more partisan than in the 
past. In many ways, this shift 
can be seen as a response to 
the pages of lies that PolitiFact 
has noted over the course of 
President 
Donald 
Trump’s 

presidency and his campaign. 
Put yourself in the shoes of a 
journalist: How do you cover 
a lie while making sure that 
A) your article isn’t seen as 
inherently partisan and B) 
your information establishes 
that the lie is, well, a lie. The 
New York Times has been 
grappling with this problem 
ever since Trump announced 
his candidacy for president. 
Despite the lies that Trump 
has told over the course of his 
presidency, newspapers still 
have 
difficulty 
explaining 

these 
kinds 
of 
falsehoods 

from a political official. In 
NYT Public Editor Liz Spayd’s 
article addressing The New 
York Times trying to grapple 
with these falsehoods, Spayd 
actually suggests using the 
term “lie” sparingly, something 
that should seem incredibly 
concerning. Because of Trump’s 
tendency to lie throughout his 
presidency, mainstream print 
journalism has yet to adapt to 
the era of Trump and has failed 
in many ways at effectively 
communicating 
how 
the 

normative values in American 
democracy are being broken.

I 
see 
Trump’s 
successful 

campaign 
as 
coming 
from 

this journalistic hesitancy. In 
attempts to ensure an article has 
a lack of partisan slant, the news 
will proceed to use language 
that seems distanced from the 
facts. This is normal, and many 
communications and journalism 
scholars would say this is critical 
for the news to do its job. With 

that said, this logic doesn’t 
quite acknowledge how this 
can be perceived by an average 
person reading the news. In 
attempting to make something 
feel “objective” — and many 
individuals, including myself, 
take serious issue with the idea 
of objectivity as a realistic goal 
— mainstream outlets can also 
make the news feel normal and 
ordinary. These stories can feel 
as if something that might be 
seen as “breaking the norm” 
as being an event that should 
happen in how we understand 
American democracy. Trump 
has broken so many norms that 
it’s hard for mainstream outlets 
to ratchet up the rhetoric when 
there are already so many 
values that are different from 
past presidencies.

To think of an example, recall 

the Access Hollywood tape. 
The New York Times decided 
that the article about the tape 
would be titled “Donald Trump 
Apology Caps Day of Outrage 
Over Lewd Tape.” The Times’s 
attempt to be impartial can 
appear as if this were ordinary. 
The word “outrage” can have 
some serious implications and 
connotations, 
but 
it 
doesn’t 

mention the comments Trump 
made on its own — quite literally 
why the story exists. Stories like 
these exemplify how the actual 
event has deviated from the 
norm within the article itself, 
but this sort of language in the 
title doesn’t do the article justice, 
and a casual reader may leave 
without fully understanding its 
importance. What it doesn’t tell 
the reader is that a man running 
for president said that he could 
sexually assault women. These 
horrific moments need to be said 
and written in ways that allow 
the reader to understand the 
gravity of what is happening in 
the political sphere, something 
that I don’t see happening in 
mainstream news outlets.

However, there is still hope 

in 
the 
journalism 
industry. 

Journalists are changing the 
way they present news, and there 

have even grown unlikely news 
sources that can help individuals 
interpret what is actually going 
on. When we think about the 
news, we think of the CNNs 
or The New York Times of 
the world as the only spaces 
where individuals get their 
news. Comedy shows rarely 
addressed politics even 10 or 20 
years ago, excluding The Daily 
Show and The Colbert Report. 
Now, however, more and more 
night shows and comedy shows 
are addressing serious topics 
in funny ways. Vox writer 
Carlos Maza, has had his finger 
on the pulse of TV political 
information for a while now, 
but his argument about how 
comedians 
have 
improved 

political awareness has become 
particularly salient: Comedians 
have the ability to call out 
ridiculous arguments and do 
so in comical ways, and it has 
started permeating into TV 
journalism as well. CNN’s Jake 
Tapper has increasingly become 
tougher in his questioning and 
statements, and it has garnered 
him millions of followers.

Print journalism needs to find 

outlets that can allow for the 
same sorts of interpretation — 
and, frankly, it needs to be done 
in ways outside of the opinion 
column. As we see print news 
employing more multimedia in 
their articles, these companies 
need to continue to evolve and 
change if they want to be able to 
inform Americans and call out 
events as normatively “breaking 
the rules” in our democracy. 
Read time for articles are 
dramatically lower, and this 
means that news stories need 
to be aggressive in getting 
important information in ways 
that a reader can interpret 
and take with them. Print 
journalism isn’t going to die, 
yet, but it could if the era of 
Trump permeates too far into 
the journalism industry.

I

f you’re white, you may 
not see it happening, but 
I want you to know our 

democracy is in a real crisis. 
By definition, a democracy is 
a government in which people 
participate. People of color 
are living with unimaginable 
oppression, and while you may 
say, “I’ve heard this before,” I 
contend you may be mistaken.

I consider myself somewhat 

aware, 
compassionate 
and 

even active in trying to make 
the world a better place for all 
of us. I’m currently taking a 
course on international human 
rights, and our textbook is 
“Human 
Rights 
in 
World 

History” by Peter Stearns. In 
the textbook’s introduction, 
Stearns writes “the United 
States government regularly 
produces reports on other 
countries’ 
human 
rights 

record…” However, rather than 
analyzing other countries, we 
need to pause and, instead, 
take a serious look inward.

On Jan. 19, I attended an 

event hosted by the University 
of Michigan focusing on the 
“lived experiences of Black 
Americans.” Rackham students 
Steven Moore and Hakeem J. 
Jefferson were the organizers 
and shared information with 
me regarding the panel on 
mass incarceration, writing 
in an email on Jan. 23, “We 
hope (to) drive home the 
massive impact this has on the 
everyday lives of so many black 
and brown people in the U.S.”

The news wasn’t hopeful. 

Racism 
continues 
to 
grow 

deeply 
while 
almost 
all 

of 
us 
well-intended 
white 

people 
continue 
to 
look 

away — liberals, moderates, 
conservatives, 
even 
many 

activists who take on different 
causes. Just ask Charnesia 
Corley. 
Andrea 
Ritchie, 
a 

nationally-recognized expert 
on policing issues, told us what 
happened just two years ago to 
Corley when she was a 20-year 
old African-American student. 
She was pulled out of her car 
for failure to stop at a stop sign 
and forced down to the ground 
while a female police officer 
pulled off her pants, forced 
her legs open and probed her 
vagina for 11 minutes in the 
parking lot. This happened on 
what started out as a regular 
day in June to an innocent 
young woman just going about 
living her life. The unjust, 
cloaked term for this is a cavity 
search. Putting your fingers in 
someone without their consent 
is, by definition, rape. It was 
done by the police, making it 
state-sanctioned rape. I am 
hard-pressed to believe this 
would have happened if she 
were a white woman in Ann 
Arbor — if she were me. This 
should concern all of us for the 
obvious humanitarian reasons, 
but also because of the impact 
on our democracy.

I also learned just how 

egregious Driving While Black, 
or DWB, is. Again, you’ve 
heard this before, right? But 
Frank Baumgartner, professor 
of political science at the 
University of North Carolina 
at Chapel Hill, has analyzed 55 
million traffic stops in every 
way possible. He and his team 
of researchers demonstrated 
not only the incredibly high 
number of times people of color 
are pulled over, but they also 
correlated voting behaviors 
and outcomes of this kind of 
treatment by the state. In the 

study, the researchers found 
that “a mere interaction with 
a police officer (not resulting 
in arrest) is associated with a 
reduction in the probability of 
voting of almost 10 percent.”

You 
may 
be 
thinking 

to 
yourself 
(because 
you 

certainly wouldn’t say it out 
loud), “Yeah, this is all really 
horrible, but what does it really 
have to do with democracy?” 
We 
allow 
skin 
color 
to 

continue to be counterfactual 
markers of social differences 
and resulting life experiences. 
White 
people 
need 
to 

acknowledge the word that 
makes so many of us cringe: 
privilege. I’m speaking here of 
the specific privilege to simply 
possess the desire to engage in 
our government. A very real 
outcome of state-sanctioned 
discrimination is a group of 
people who lack a desire to 
engage in anything having 
to do with that state. When 
our state disempowers and 
discourages civic engagement 
of 
the 
Black 
community, 

we cannot claim to have a 
functioning democracy. Why 
would Charnesia Corley want 
to participate in a government 
that not only allows something 
like this to happen to her, but 
was the perpetrator?

Stearns has this to say 

about revolution: “People in 
various societies at various 
times, had attacked reigning 
governments 
because 
of 

economic 
deprivation, 

injustice, corruption, unfair 
property distribution.” I say, 
make no mistake; we may just 
require a revolution.

HOLLY HONIG | OP-ED

Holly Honig is an LSA Junior 

T

he recently published 
Campus Affordability 
Guide by the University 

of Michigan’s Central Student 
Government 
has 
produced 

understandable and justifiable 
backlash. 
Affordability 
in 

Ann Arbor is a structural 
issue 
and 
will 
hardly 
be 

solved by suggesting students 
spend less money. One of 
the biggest costs to students 
is rent, which continues to 
increase every year. As the 
University continues to admit 
more students and refuses to 
build more housing for those 
students, more are pushed 
into 
the 
private 
market. 

Due to the high cost of land 
and developers seeking to 
maximize profits, the market 
will 
continue 
to 
supply 

unaffordable luxury student 
high-rises. Students, however, 
need not be powerless as 
consumers in the housing 
market. One recommendation 
of 
the 
affordability 
guide 

that CSG should pursue is the 
reformation of the Ann Arbor 
Tenants’ Union. The AATU 
was formed in 1968 as the 
coordinating committee of a 
city-wide rent strike initially 
protesting the poor housing 
at a time when 90 percent of 
rental properties failed to 
meet city code requirements. 
After 
its 
formation, 
the 

AATU 
undertook 
several 

more strike and advocacy 
actions 
to 
combat 
failure 

to meet code requirements, 
privacy violations and sexual 
harassment 
in 
cooperation 

with women’s groups and anti-
racism efforts. In addition to 
serving the whole of the Ann 
Arbor area, the AATU received 
most of its funding from 
Central Student Government, 
then known as the Michigan 
Student Assembly. In 2004, 
CSG 
stopped 
funding 
the 

union, despite 58 percent of 
the student body voting to 
continue funding the union 
through a one-dollar increase 

in tuition. CSG’s decision to 
stop funding the AATU led to 
its dissolution in 2004.

CSG provided funds to the 

AATU as well as office space in 
the Michigan Union because of 
the benefits the AATU provided 
to students. The vast majority 
of students are renters in Ann 
Arbor and renting for the first 
time, making us particularly 
vulnerable 
to 
predatory 

actions by landlords. Due 
to CSG funding, the AATU 
provided 
free 
services 

to students such as legal 
advice when dealing with 
landlord issues as well as 
lobbying efforts on behalf of 
the city’s renters. At the time, 
CSG incorrectly claimed the 
AATU was ineffective. While 
students can get legal advice 
from Student Legal Services 
when dealing with landlord 
issues, it hardly fulfills the same 
advocacy on behalf of students 
that the AATU once did.

A great deal of the need for 

the reformation of the AATU 
is the disempowered status 
of students. Looking at the 
wards of Ann Arbor, from 
which City Council members 
are elected, one notices that 
they look like slices of pie. 
They are shaped this way for 
an explicit and by no means 
accidental purpose. At the 
height of student activism in 
the late ‘60s, students wielded 
substantial influence over city 
council. When this activism 
subsided in the ‘80s, the wards 
were redrawn to weaken and 
disempower students.

Additionally, 
because 

Ann Arbor is a Democratic 
stronghold, 
City 
Council 

members often run unopposed 
in the general election, thus 
making 
the 
only 
election 

of 
meaning 
the 
August 

party primary. Students are 
often not on campus at the 
beginning 
of 
August, 
and 

thus the average age of the 
primary voters is mid- to late-
60s. Because students don’t 

vote for the members of City 
Council, the city government 
has little electoral incentive to 
represent our interests. While 
Zach Ackerman, D-Ward 3, 
was able to win a seat on the 
council as a student, he is the 
exception and not the rule. 
He is also the only member of 
the 11-member city council who 
rents and is not a homeowner, a 
significant underrepresentation 
considering that 40 percent of 
Ann Arbor residents are renters.

The 
reformation 
of 
the 

AATU would give students 
political power as renters. 
It would have the ability to 
influence City Council year-
round when the students are 
not here and be an institution 
that represents our interests. 
When the AATU existed, it 
demonstrated its power and 
influence by initiating rent 
strikes and even suing the city 
of Ann Arbor. In 2004, students 
felt that the AATU should 
continue its existence, and it is 
unfortunate that CSG did not 
honor the will of the students 
at that time. While restoring 
the AATU would not be a 
silver bullet solution to fixing 
affordability in Ann Arbor, its 
return would be something 
CSG could do to improve 
affordability in Ann Arbor 
and an effective use of student 
tuition dollars; providing an 
important service to students 
that the affordability guide 
does not. The tenants’ union 
at the University of Illinois at 
Urbana-Champaign was used 
by nearly 8,000 students in 
2015 and assisted in writing 
a 
comprehensive 
landlord-

tenant ordinance in Urbana. 
If there is one thing that 
comes out of the backlash 
to the Campus Affordability 
Guide, it should be for CSG to 
take action on its call for the 
reformation of the Ann Arbor 
Tenants’ Union.

Tuesday, January 30, 2018 — 5

Last year was the year of Migos. 
They began 2017 by releasing their 
tour de force, Culture, a project that 
catapulted them to international 
stardom. They maintained their 
public presence throughout the 
year: A series of well-placed 
features (e.g. “Slide” by Calvin 
Harris 
and 
“Congratulations” 
by Post Malone), the release of 
collaborative 
albums 
(Huncho 
Jack, Jack Huncho and Without 
Warning) as well as a leading role 
on Quality Control’s compilation 
album Control the Streets Volume 
1 kept them in the limelight.
There was no way that Culture 
II would have that same X-factor 
that Culture possessed; sequels 
almost never do. My first listen 
through, I really disliked this 
album. I went in worried that the 
excessive length and repetitious 
flows of the members (a crime of 
which Quavo is particularly guilty) 
would make this project a chore to 
get through. The opening tracks 
seemed to confirm my fears — this 
would be a project bogged down by 
sameness and lack of innovation, 
the death knell of Migos’s time in 
the spotlight. Sure, “Walk It Talk 
It,” “BBO (Bad Bitches Only)” and 

maybe “Narcos” would be hits, 
but they felt stale nonetheless 
and were surrounded by below 
average cuts. It was only on track 
nine (“Stir Fry”) that the album 
began to feel like something new. 
Previously released as a single, 
this Pharrell-produced song is an 

auspicious sign for the rest of the 
album. “Too Much Jewelry” is 
OK but bland until the 2:45 mark, 
where some captivating autotune 
comes in (it sounds almost like a 
talkbox at times). “White Sand” is 
probably the most disappointing 
track on the album — with Travis 
Scott production and a star-
studded ensemble of features one 
would expect a strong outing, but 
the end product is weak in every 
way.
Perhaps the most interesting 
track is “Gang Gang.” The beat 
grabs immediately — it’s kind of 
melancholy, not a vibe ever really 
explored by Migos before. It’s 
quite poppy as well (produced by 
The Arcade, known mostly for his 
work with Iggy Azalea). It perhaps 
suffers from a overly-repetitive 

hook, but it’s new territory for 
Migos regardless.
The decision to make a 24-track 
album bottom-heavy is bold, the 
stretch from tracks 20-23 (“Notice 
Me” to “Top Down On Da NAWF”) 
being the most consistent section 
of the album by far. Culture felt 
polished and restrained, only 13 
tracks long. Culture II is almost 
double that, and in serious need of 
some cuts.
An ideal version of Culture II 
would have a tracklist something 
like:
“Supastars”
“Narcos”
“BBO (Bad Bitches Only)”
“Walk It Talk It”
“Stir Fry”
“Too Much Jewelry”
“Gang Gang”
“Crown the Kings”
“Open It Up”
“Motorsport”
“Notice Me”
“Too Playa”
“Made Men”
“Top Down On Da NAWF”
This 
tracklist 
would 
rival 
Culture in terms of quality and 
variety, but not in terms of cultural 
influence. Culture II feels like a 
transitionary album; Migos have 
reached a point in their career at 
which they have to choose what 
path to follow next.

On ‘Culture II’ Migos falls 
victim to the sequel curse

QUALITY CONTROL

I met a stranger this Tuesday 
at The Ark.
Now at my keyboard, I want 
to make another introduction to 
you: Here is Backstage Pass, The 
Daily’s new series where writers 
share their experiences meeting 
new people in the setting of Ann 
Arbor’s arts scene.
At the top of the staircase 
in this house of folk, I kept an 
eye out for indicators of an 
undergraduate female in the 
line of people ascending the 
staircase. A girl in a red coat 
came up to me asking if I was 
Alex. Easy.
Mariah 
Scissom, 
LSA 
sophomore, 
joined 
me 
for 
Twisted 
Pine’s 
performance 
at The Ark on “Take A Chance 
Tuesday,” where non perishable 
food donations were welcomed 
in place of ticket fare.
In 
the 
prelude 
to 
the 
performance, we talked about 
Fleetwood 
Mac’s 
Rumours, 
an 
album 
thematically 
and 
sequentially 
linked 
to 
the 
breakups of the band members. I 
also learned that Mic Fleetwood 
is a member of Fleetwood Mac, 
and we agreed Fleetwood Mic 
would have probably been a 
less suitable band name. So it 
felt eerily coincidental that, 
after this conversation, Twisted 
Pine’s performance seemed to 
be love-themed and spoke to bad 
relationships. The night’s set 
featured “Bad Boyfriend” — for 
all of those in the audience who 
have had a bad boyfriend “or are 
a bad boyfriend,” said guitarist 
Rachel Sumner.
While I watched the quartet 
strum on stage, I thought about 
how I would confront the 

unfamiliar task of how to write 
about music. I’m not well-versed 
in the language of music — I 
don’t know how to speak about 
it — but I believe I know how 
to engage my ears. I let myself 
absorb the beats and vibrations 
from the instruments and vocals, 
physically feeling the emotion in 
the music. I really try to listen 
to the lyrics so they register 
as words rather than sounds, 
listening and connecting to the 
stories that singers vocalize.
I realized that music is another 
medium, like visual art, to share 
universal themes, feelings and 
passions 
that 
everyone 
will 
experience in some way. In the 
dim lighting of this music hall, an 
audience of strangers engaged in 
communal listening, captivated 
by the unifying vibrations and 
vocals of Twisted Pine.
This felt like the right type 
of place to meet a new person. 
Art is a good fostering ground 
for 
connection. 
Music 
and 
art filled our conversations, 
and together we shared the 
experience 
of 
enjoying 
the 
music. We commented on what 
we had expected and were 
surprised by during the breaks 
between songs, and we laughed 
at funny commentary from the 
performers.
Mariah told me she doesn’t 
really know how to talk about 
music either. But she helped 
me out in trying to explain the 
sounds we experienced.
“It was a little folky, wasn’t 
it?” she said. “But it also kinda 
had some flair.”
I would say so. Twisted Pine’s 
website describes the band as 
a quartet that has progressed 
from 
its 
bluegrass 
origins, 
moving “beyond the standard 
verse-chorus-solo 
structure 
of traditional string bands ... 

(bringing) the enveloping sound 
and pop hooks of indie music 
to an acoustic instrumental 
setting.”
The band brought a good 
energy that was visible in their 
group dynamic on stage.
“You 
could 
tell 
they 
all 
supported each other ‘cause they 
would just smile at each other 
or nod along when someone 
was doing a solo,” Mariah said. 
“The whole vibe of the band and 
the way they interact with each 
other made it more interesting 
and more fun.”
The members of Twisted Pine 
connected with each other and 
connected in creating music. 
And being the visual arts lover 
I am, the visual elements of 
the performance piqued my 
curiosity: the color blocking on 
fiddler Kathleen Parks’s shift 
dress, Rachel Sumner’s striking 
resemblance to my cousin, the 
sway of the bass in Chris Sartori’s 
grip and Mandolinist Dan Bui’s 
expression 
of 
concentration 
and passion as he played his 
instrument.
The performance ended on a 
familiar note: some Bill Monroe, 
The Beatles and a warm farewell 
from 
Sumner: 
“Thank 
you 
Michigan, we love you!”
Afterward, we walked up 
Main Street until we broke off at 
State Theatre. We are both Art 
History majors, and along the 
way, we shared our aspirations 
to forge professional careers 
in the art world. So, my night 
ended on an exciting note — high 
from talking about my passions 
and dreams. In saying farewell 
to this stranger that I may not 
meet again, to this band I may 
not see again, I took away with 
me invigorated optimism for the 
power of art to connect people — 
strangers and friends alike.

Backstage Pass: Meeting a 
stranger for Twisted Pine

ALEX SUPPAN
Daily Arts Writer

Dual universes, same actor 
playing 
multiple 
characters, 
espionage 
thriller 
with 
sci-fi
 
elements — yawn. We’ve all seen 
that before. On the surface, Starz’s 
“Counterpart” seems to be a new 
addition into the canon of works 
we’ve seen a million times, but 
with a tight, smart plot and some 
virtuoso performances, it manages 
to stand out from the pack.
Set in Berlin, “Counterpart” 
centers upon Howard Silk (J.K. 
Simmons, “Whiplash”), an aging, 
lowly bureaucrat who is trying 
to finally move up the corporate 
ladder while also trying to remain 
hopeful after his wife enters a 
coma as a result of an accident. 
He is thrust into the center of an 
incredible conflict when he meets 
his “other,” a physically identical 
version of himself who lives 
in another dimension. He also 
discovers that the very building he 
works with is the “crossing” into 
the other dimension.
Purely based on the premise, 
this show could have fallen 
horribly flat with an ineffective 
portrayal of Silk and his other. 
Luckily, 
J.K. 
Simmons 
goes 

above and beyond “serviceable” 
and provides the single most 
compelling reason to watch this 
show. Silk in “our” world is a tame, 
bumbling, bureaucratic slave — 
exactly the type of guy who can 
work at a place for 30 years and 
never manage to get a promotion. 
The “other” Silk puts Simmons 
in more familiar territory. He is 
more reminiscent of the stern jazz 
instructor Terence Fletcher in 
“Whiplash,” exuding confidence 
and machismo as he enters 

“our” world to chase down an 
interdimensional killer.
When presented with the task of 
playing multiple characters, many 
actors fall into the habit of letting 
themselves creep into both roles 
rather than letting each character 
breathe on their own. Simmons 
avoids this completely and plays 
both Silks with a stunning level 
of 
nuance. 
Everything 
down 
to small facial movements and 
speaking tone is distinct for 
both characters, making it more 

impactful when both Silks discuss 
the commonalities they actually 
share. While Simmons steals 
the show, the characters of Peter 
Quayle (Harry Lloyd, “Game of 
Thrones”) and Aldrich (Ulrich 
Thomsen, 
“Mortdecai”) 
are 
valuable, if understated, additions.
The world of “Counterpart” 
has a simultaneously retro and 
futuristic aesthetic, juxtaposing 
large, ancient computers with 
modern EDM nightclubs. The 
writing is tight, featuring few lines 
of wasted dialogue and moving the 
plot forward at a brisk pace. While 
it seems that there is an immense 
number of plot points to dig into 
and eventually tie together, these 
attributes inspire confidence that 
the show will be able to pull such a 
feat off successfully.
Perhaps the most intriguing part 
of the show is the set of questions it 
already raises. The Howard Silks 
we meet are physically identical 
and even share the same wives, 
families, etc. Their incredibly 
obvious divergence in personality 
asks the question of whether they 
were each born with different 
personalities or whether it can be 
attributed to a series of different 
life choices. The well-crafted first 
episode is a solid encouragement 
to come back for the answers.

‘Counterpart’ bolstered

SAYAN GHOSH
Daily Arts Writer

The “Maze Runner” films have 
always been some of the most 
resoundingly average entries to 
come out of the young adult boom 
of the late 2000s, neither as good 
as the first two “Hunger Games” 
movies or as bad as the last two 
“Hunger Games” movies. The 
characters are nothing special 
and there’s not really anything 
to the performances despite 
the obvious talent of the cast in 
other projects, but the action is 
generally thrilling and there’s 
a sense of a scale that’s missing 
from other films of this sort. The 
movies overall just fall into the 
middle ground of the genre as 
a result: mostly forgettable but 
semi-enjoyable in the moment.
On the surface, “The Death 
Cure” — which finds Thomas 
(Dylan 
O’Brien, 
“American 
Assassin”) and co. traveling to 
the last city on Earth to rescue 
their captured friends from 
evil organization WCKD — is 
no different in those regards. 
It’s 
underneath 
that 
veneer 
that something different begins 
to show. It struck me as I was 
walking out of the theater: “The 
Death Cure” represents the end 
of an era. The “Maze Runner” 
series, 
despite 
its 
middling 
quality, is the last major young 
adult franchise from the boom 
that gave us “The Hunger 
Games,” “The Divergent Series,” 
“The Twilight Saga” and even the 
“Harry Potter” films. It’s almost 
an ill-advised eulogy in that it 
represents many of the tropes 

and storytelling techniques that 
those familiar with the genre 
have come to know like the back 
of their hand.
The script manages to skip the 
outright lying to the audience 
that bogged down the second 
chapter in the trilogy, “The 
Scorch Trials” — a film that tried 

so hard to escape its genre that 
it wound up epitomizing many 
of its worst aspects — but there’s 
still a depressing dearth of 
character development. Thomas, 
like most YA protagonists, is the 
most bland part of the movies 
he’s ostensibly the star of, with 
no traits besides “the good guy” 
and “handsome” to make him 
in any way memorable. Without 
good writing to form the basis, 
“The Death Cure” spends most 
of its runtime manufacturing 
plot contrivances to shuffle its 
characters around between set 
pieces, as they’re not three-
dimensional enough to make 
decisions that would affect the 
story in interesting ways.
However, 
actively 
fighting 
to help his movie rise above its 
script is director Wes Ball, who 
made his feature film debut with 
the original film and has almost 
singlehandedly made the series 
watchable. If there’s one thing 
to take away from “The Death 
Cure,” it’s that someone needs 

to give Ball a script worthy 
of his talents. The story he 
works with here may be total 
nonsense, but the action scenes 
he weaves in are some of the 
best the genre has ever seen. 
From the opening sequence, 
a thrilling train heist straight 
out of a “Mad Max”/“Fast and 
Furious” crossover, Ball handles 
the scope of the action with 
seeming ease, and by the nigh-
apocalyptic climax that recalls 
a far more interesting version of 
“Mockingjay – Part 2,” viewers 
may find it easy to simply let go 
and appreciate the insane scope 
of what he’s crafted.
He isn’t always successful, as 
“The Death Cure” still eventually 
succumbs 
to 
the 
bloated 
exposition and poor pacing that 
have defined much of his series. 
This final installment clocks in 
at almost two and a half hours 
long, which would be hard to sit 
through even if it was seemingly 
intentionally extended. Again, 
this has more to do with the 
script and the demands of the 
genre than anything else. By 
the time we’ve fallen back into 
the well-worn plot of another 
resistance group (of course) 
helping our heroes take the 
down the big bad corporation 
(of course) who has secretly 
been monitoring their entire 
lives (of course) for the greater 
good (of course) because they’re 
special (of course), there’s not 
much anyone could have done to 
save it. Whether it’s looked at as 
the finale of its series or the de 
facto endgame of its genre, “The 
Death Cure” can’t outrun its own 
formulaic writing.

“You’ll 
have 
to 
excuse 
me,” said Phillis Engelbert, 
standing and retrieving a glass 
of water from the quirky bar 
situated in the main dining 
area of Detroit Filling Station, 
one of her three restaurants. 
“We hosted ‘Lesbo Bingo’ last 
night, and I’m exhausted.”
This pretty much describes 
the carefree, quirky, lively 
personality 
of 
the 
Filling 
Station — a restaurant with 
personality pouring from its 
warm, vintage brick walls. 
Engelbert sits back down and 
begins to share her world 
with me over a bowl of vegan, 
gluten-free tater tots with a 
side of “Yum Yum sauce.”
“Well, it started out with 
us just cooking on Sundays 
and really grew from there,” 
said Engelbert, co owner of 
Detroit Filling Station and The 
Lunch Room bakery and cafe. 
This is something I can relate 
to. The best things grow out 
of Sunday dinners. Together 
with neighbor and friend Joel 
Panozzo, 
Engelbert 
began 
to host vegan dinner parties 
when the pair realized they 
had a mutual affection for 
vegan food and culinary art. 
From there, they operated 
a vegan food cart starting 
in 2011, which was run in a 
parking lot and manifested 
from a passion for vegan food 
and a Kickstarter campaign. 
She had no experience in the 
business, nor did she go to 
school for entrepreneurship 
or culinary art — which shows 
how far a passion for the 
kitchen can truly take you.
Panozzo 
and 
Engelbert 
make an unlikely pair, being 
an older woman and a young 
man. Despite their differences, 
they share many passions and 
similarities, which makes them 
great business partners. They 
are able to both collaborate 
and split the work between the 

two of them, in order to keep 
all three businesses running 
smoothly.
Since 2013, the dynamic 
duo have been running the 
vegan food scene in Ann 
Arbor with their three vegan-
based destination restaurants 
that 
are 
popular 
among 
locals 
and 
students 
alike. 
An ambitious feat — opening 
vegan restaurants — Engelbert 
claims that many friends and 
acquaintances urged her and 
Panozzo to “not even try at all” 
when they began dreaming up 

plans for a vegan restaurant in 
Ann Arbor. Engelbert began 
her journey to becoming a 
successful restaurateur when 
she worked forty hours a week 
as a college student in order to 
pay her way through a college 
degree from the University. 
From there, she held an array 
of 
jobs, 
including 
writing 
textbooks 
and 
reference 
books, to freelance writing, to 
running nonprofits. In the past 
five years, she has grown into 
an experienced entrepreneur, 
navigating the challenges of 
restaurant life with ease and 
grace.
“Running a restaurant is a 
lot like community organizing, 
actually,” 
she 
remarked. 
“There’s a deal of creativity 
and problem solving involved 
in both.”
Throughout 
our 
conversation alone, she dealt 
with the erratic blinking sign 
outside, a shortage of staff 
for the evening, restocking 
the bar, communicating with 
The Lunch Room (which is 
only 500 feet from Detroit 
Filling Station) and receiving 
various shipments. The staff, 
filled with unique individuals, 
each friendly and bright, were 
quick to answer to her, and 
the lunch shift seemed to run 
smoothly despite a few bumps 
in the road. Both restaurants 
often reach capacity, but due 
to their close proximity, on a 
busy night they are often able 
to accommodate most guests. 
When asked to describe 
how she is able to operate 
two similar, albeit unique, 
restaurants just 500 feet from 
one another, she describes 
them 
as 
two 
completely 
different beings that are linked 
with small comparisons. The 
Lunch Room is an older sister 
to Detroit Filling Station, if 
you will.
“The price point is nearly 
identical, 
but 
the 
menus 
are 
quite 
different. 
Both 
restaurants have chili, but 
the recipes are different. (At 
the Detroit Filling Station) 
we have pizza and ramen. At 
The Lunch Room, we have 
certain sandwiches and salads 
that we don’t serve here. 
Most people who come eat at 
one have been to both and it 
honestly just depends on the 
mood of the customer that day 
when choosing which they’d 
like to eat at,” she said, as she 
accepted a delivery for wine 
and worked with an employee 
to put a price on the beverage 
per glass. 
When The Lunch Room 
became too popular for its 
minimal 
seating, 
Engelbert 
and Panozzo opened up Filling 
Station in Aug. 2017, and have 
seen incredible success since. 
Just a few-minute drive away 
is the third of their businesses: 
a 
vegan 
cafe 
and 
bakery 
serving sandwiches, soups and 
a wide array of baked goods.
In the beginning of her love 
affair with the world of vegan 
cuisine, Engelbert relied on 
cook books to guide her in the 
right direction with her menu 
choices. Since then, however, 
she has worked with groups 
of talented cooks to create 
unique 
dishes. 
Oftentimes, 
she’ll look at a dish that is not 
vegan (say mac and cheese, 

for example) and ask herself 
the question: What could I 
substitute or use to make this 
dish vegan? That’s how one of 
the most popular Lunch Room 
dishes, the vegan mac and 
cheese, came to be.
At the end of the day, other 
than serving the customer 
and bringing a vegan food 
scene to Ann Arbor, Engelbert 

looks to create a community 
out of her restaurants. Her 
main prerogative is to give 
the restaurants each a unique 
sense of fun and belonging. 
Obviously, it’s all about the 
food, but bigger than that is the 
ability for a meal out to be an 
experience. This is something 
she hopes to capture with 
each new group of guests that 
comes through the front door. 
“There is such a camaraderie 
between the staff and the 
customers at all three places. 
I can’t even explain the energy 
and feeling in The Lunch 
Room, but if you’ve been there, 
you just know it,” she said.
And she’s certainly right 
— every meal I’ve had at The 
Lunch Room was an incredibly 
warm, 
positive 
and 
joyful 
experience, the space filled 
with a cozy sense of home. My 
first time at The Lunch Room, 
I had the “Taco ‘Bout it Salad,” 
which I highly recommend. 
Personal 
favorites, 
though 
having a gluten allergy and a 
sweet tooth are the vegan ice 
cream sundae and the peanut 
butter 
gluten-free 
baked 
goods.
When 
people 
walk 
into 
restaurants, they’re generally 
looking for more than food — 
which is what makes eating out 
special. Customers are looking 
to have a social experience, 
to feel a part of something 
greater and to share a meal or 
a drink with friends. That’s 
what these three restaurants 
seek to do: bring Ann Arbor 
something more than just 
great vegan food.
To that point, Engelbert 
pauses with a tater tot between 
her fingers, hanging in the air.
“To me, it’s so much more 
than what they put in their 
mouth. Sure, it starts with 
food, but it becomes the whole 
vibe and feel of the place, and 
that’s what’s so important to 
me with these places.”

hidden gems

DAILY FOOD COLUMN

It’s Jan., and Ty Segall 
has already dropped another 
album. It’s only been 364 days 
since his last solo 
project, and it’d 
be best to assume 
that 
Freedom’s 
Goblin isn’t going 
to 
be 
Segall’s 
only release this 
year. Not that this 
album wouldn’t be enough to 
satisfy fans — in fact, quite the 
opposite. Even though his most 
recent LP runs 74 minutes, 
this prodigious So-Cal rocker 
has already shown us time and 
time again that he’ll inevitably 

be back for more.
On Freedom’s Goblin, Segall’s 
style 
continues 
to 
evolve. 
Although 
his 
fundamentals 
root in garage rock, we have 
seen him delve into genres as 
distinctive as folk and glam 
rock on records 
such as Sleeper 
and Manipulator. 
However, 
what 
ultimately 
makes 
Segall’s 
most recent LP 
distinctive is the 
grandiose fusion between all 
the styles he has navigated 
over the past few years.
This fusion doesn’t come 
without 
contrast. 
In 
fact, 
Freedom’s Goblin continually 
swings 
back 
and 
forth 

between texture, pace and 
instrumentation. Gentle folk 
melodies will pop up between 
furious garage rock fuzz. While 
large shifts in pace and texture 
will fall short for most artists, 
Ty Segall further demonstrates 
his dynamic range in both 
composition and sheer guitar-
playing 
ability. 
Ultimately, 
his 10th solo project sees him 
neatly stringing together all 
the grooves that have shaped 
his work over the past decade.
If one thing’s for sure, 
Freedom’s Goblin is not boring. 
The guitar oozes like a ’70s 
synthesizer 
on 
“Despoiler 
of Cadaver,” which against 
the 
robotic, 
808-drumkit-
esque 
beat 
transforms 
the 
would-be 
psychedelic 
track

into something closer to a 
French club hit. “Meaning” 
sees the band toy with the 
noise and overdriven guitar 
that 
characterized 
their 
lo-fi beginnings. There’s an 
explosion of punk and free 
jazz on “Talkin 3.” Like each 
album before it, Freedom’s 
Goblin sees Segall continuing 
to 
push 
his 
experimental 
tendencies. However, rather 
than surveying a single genre, 
his 
most 
recent 
blends 
a 
variety of styles into a single 
rambunctious medley.
Thematically, 
Segall 
revolves around the same few 
ideas 
that 
have 
continued 
to animate him through his 
discography: 
freedom, 
love 

and 
individual 
expression. 
The songwriting is lean and 
the 
lyrics 
concise. 
Across 
the album, he shifts between 
childlike curiosity with lines 
like “When mommy tries to 
kill you / What are you to 
do / Climb under the sheets 
and dream of future days” to 
melancholic asides in jubilant 
anthems like “Before you had a 
name / Before the sailors came 
/ I would fight to save you / I 
would give my life.”
The 
album 
closes 
with 
the 
12-minute 
opus 
“And, 
Goodnight.” 
Borrowing 
lyrically 
from 
the 
track 
“Sleeper” of his self-titled 2013 
album, this incarnation is far 
from the acoustic textures 

of the older track. The track 
is fully electric: Guitars flail 
and spew for minutes on end, 
Segall and company slamming 
into grooves that come off 
more like a jam session than a 
recorded track. It’s likely the 
closest thing we’re going to see 
to Electric Ladyland this year.
Every 
Ty 
Segall 
fan 
is 
different: Some gravitate to 
his fuzzy garage rock roots 
while others find solace in 
his downtempo ballads, not to 
mention those who crave his 
deep dives into psychedelic, 
indie, punk, noise and glam 
rock among the other disparate 
genres. Even still, on Freedom’s 
Goblin, every fan will find 
something to love.

Flaherty, Barnes Arico playing numbers game

For the No. 13 Michigan 

women’s basketball team (8-2 
Big Ten, 19-4 overall), this 
season has been all about 
numbers. Coach Kim Barnes 
Arico 
and 
senior 
guard 

Katelynn Flaherty have set 
the tone, trading statistical 
milestones.

It 
all 
started 
in 
mid-

November, 
when 
the 

Wolverines faced then-No. 5 
Louisville on the road. Though 
her team lost in a lopsided 
contest, Flaherty finished with 
23 points to reach a career total 
of 2,091, breaking Diane Dietz’s 
program 
scoring 
record 
of 

2,076 points.

With an upcoming trip to 

Madison, Barnes Arico decided 
to join in the fun.

To 
start 
the 
new 
year, 

Michigan 
conquered 

Wisconsin, 80-57. The victory 
marked Barnes Arico’s 124th 
triumph, and she became the 
program’s winningest coach in 
history, passing Sue Guevara.

Nine days later, Flaherty 

continued her own dominance 
as 
the 
Wolverines 
played 

Nebraska in Lincoln — where 
Michigan fought back from a 
late-game deficit to prevail in 
overtime.

During the second quarter of 

that same contest, Flaherty — 

in her usual element — drained 
a shot from well beyond the 
arc. But that 3-pointer was 
different. It propelled Flaherty 
beyond Glen Rice’s record of 
2,442 points, making her the 
program’s 
all-time 
leading 

scorer, man or woman.

Then 
last 
Sunday 
in 

Evanston, it was Barnes Arico’s 
turn yet again as the Wolverines 
dismantled 
Northwestern, 

80-59. 
The 
signature 
win 

was the 400th of her head 
coaching career — a career 
that began back in 1996 at 
Fairleigh Dickinson University 
in Madison, N.J.

Barnes Arico then coached 

for two years at the New Jersey 
Institute of Technology and 
then another three at Adelphi 
University in New York. Prior 
to joining Michigan in 2012, 
she held the reins at St. John’s 
for 10 years.

Although 
Sunday 
was 
a 

notable moment in her career, 
before the game she was more 
focused on the matchup against 
the Wildcats. In fact, she wasn’t 
aware of the milestone.

“Yeah, I didn’t know,” Barnes 

Arico professed to MGoBlueTV. 
“Today I was watching the Big 
Ten game at noon and they said 
it on the broadcast. So, I was a 
little nervous that I might get 
swarmed with some water. I 
need to start being like coach 
Beilein and get a Super Soaker 

so I can fight back.

“It’s just a great honor to 

be at this university and have 
an opportunity to coach the 
players that I do. So, it’s me 
being old and me having great 
players. So, just thank you 
for everyone that’s decided to 
come here and play for this 
great university. It’s made a 
difference in my life.”

But it’s not just Flaherty and 

Barnes Arico who have been 
posting record numbers.

The Wolverines, as a team, 

are doing so too. They boast a 
six-game winning streak and 
sit at their highest national 
ranking since hitting No. 12 in 
2001.

Michigan 
is 
also 
second 

in the Big Ten, just one game 
behind No. 14 Maryland.

“The strength of our team is 

everybody else is getting better 
and better and better,” Barnes 
Arico 
told 
WTKA, 
“which 

makes us tough to defend.”

If 
the 
Wolverines 
can 

maintain 
their 
momentum, 

they could move into that 
top 
conference 
spot. 
But 

unsurprisingly, Barnes Arico 
isn’t fixated on this number 
either.

“We’re gonna take it one 

game at a time,” Barnes Arico 
said. “I like where we are. I like 
the confidence in our kids. I like 
how they’re staying focused 
and they’re staying locked in.”

‘M’ finds improvement in early season performance

A group of five Michigan 

runners came into the Boston 
U. John Thomas Terrier Classic 
looking to break the four-minute 
barrier — the barrier that separates 
great from elite.

The year prior, at the same 

meet, three Wolverines broke 
that barrier, and this year’s group 
anticipated a similar result.

None of them could.
But to Michigan distance coach 

Kevin Sullivan, that was okay.

“The biggest thing is last year, 

we put a lot of focus on trying to 
break four minutes this weekend,” 
Sullivan said. “What happened 
was we were really successful in 
that as we had three guys that 
were under four minutes, but we 
didn’t run as well at the end of the 
season.

“This year, there’s much more 

of a focus on making sure these 
guys run fast at the end of the 
season. The key is improvement 
instead of having our best race this 
weekend.”

For the Michigan men’s track 

and field team, burning out too 
early is a mistake they want to 
avoid making again. Connor Mora, 
one of the three runners who broke 
four minutes in last year’s Classic, 
underperformed by his standards 
for the race, but for the coaching 
staff, the senior’s performance 
was well within its expectations.

“So really for us, (Mora) took a 

step forward from where he was 
two weeks ago,” Sullivan said. “I 
know he’s a little disappointed 
that he didn’t run faster, but we’re 
moving in the right direction to be 
at our best when it really matters.”

Finishing the mile with a time 

of 4:06.81, he tied for 23rd in the 
non-scoring meet. His co-finisher 
was 
fifth-year 
senior 
Aaron 

Baumgarten. Traditionally a 3k and 
5k distance runner, Baumgarten 
lowered his competition distance 
for an opportunity to run faster in 
the mile.

Making the best of his chance, 

he sprinted to a fast start and was 
on pace to break four minutes. 
However, with a quarter of the 
distance left to go, Baumgarten 
failed to break away with the 
leading pack and fell behind as he 

was passed by teammate Chase 
Barnett. Placing 15th overall, 
Barnett finished with a time of 
4:03.96 — the fastest time out of 
the Michigan runners.

“I think for (Barnett), it was 

a really positive step forward,” 
Sullivan said. “He’s a guy who 
showed a lot of promise as a 
sophomore and basically injured 
his entire junior year. For him to 
step back in and be at the level that 
he’s at is really a positive step for us 
and I think that he’s only going to 
get better from there.”

Barnett’s promise bloomed as 

he positioned himself to make 
the finish that he did. With a final 
push in the latter half of the race, 
Barnett finished runner-up within 
his section and only a tenth of a 
second shy of his career best.

Freshman Jack Aho shined as 

well, setting a personal record. 
With a time of 4:07.03, Aho 
showed potential that could prove 
useful down the road for the Big 
Ten Championships.

“Jack as a true freshman,” 

Sullivan said, “he was the one guy 
who came away with the personal 
best today. He beat his previous 

best by almost two seconds, so for 
him to be doing that in January is a 
pretty (good) sign at least for now.”

As the Classic participants 

showed 
improvement, 
the 

remainder of the team — which 
attended the Saginaw Valley 
State Jet’s Pizza Invitational 
— followed suit. Many runners 
posted career-bests. One such 
runner was freshman Josiah 
Carpenter, who ran a 22.34 and 
49.44 for the 200-meter and 400-
meter, respectively.

In a similar fashion, freshman 

Vail Hartman set personal records 
in the same distances, posting a 
22.64 and 48.66. The Jet’s Pizza 
Invitational, an event for less 
experienced 
runners, 
proved 

to be a success for the team’s 
confidence. The Wolverines used 
the race as a display of what they 
can bring to the fold come time 
when it matters.

“We’re looking to improve 

every 
week,” 
Sullivan 
said. 

“And I think we’re better than 
we were two weeks ago, and 
we have a month until Big Ten 
Championships, so we’ll continue 
to improve until that point.”

Fahey finds voice in win

If you were anywhere near 

the Varsity Tennis Center on 
Sunday, you probably heard 
Kate Fahey shouting or hyping 
herself up, point after point.

If you weren’t? Well, the 

Michigan women’s tennis team 
took a thunderous win 4-1 
against Tulsa on Sunday.

The junior has undoubtedly 

been the voice of the Wolverines, 
both figuratively and literally. 
Fahey’s play and actions have a 
trickle-down effect on the team. 
As the No. 1 singles player for 
the Wolverines, whenever she is 
energized, the rest of the team is 
energized.

“She’s done such a great 

job at the top of the lineup,” 
said Michigan coach Ronni 
Bernstein. “I feel like no matter 
who she plays, we have a good 
shot for the next point. When 
you have that at the top it gives 
everyone below you a lot of 
confidence.

“She’s getting off quickly 

against a good opponent, I think 
she’s a good competitor. Kate’s 
tough, it definitely helps us 
having her.”

Throughout 

both 
the 

singles 
match 

and 
doubles 

match, Fahey’s 
exuberant 
screams 
of 

“Let’s 
go!” 

overshadowed 
the play of her 
opponents. 
Perhaps 
that 

was the point. 
Fahey’s 
chants, 
along 
with 

her blindingly fast volleys and 
lateral agility, are just some of 
the weapons in her arsenal.

“I mean, in the doubles and 

singles I use it to get me fired 
up and the whole team,” Fahey 
said. “If I hear someone else 
screaming ‘Come on!’ I know 

that it really fires me up so I 
think it really helps us all when 
we’re loud together as a team.”

During the second set of 

her match against Tulsa’s No. 
1 
player 
Ksenia 
Laskutova, 

Fahey raced out to a 4-0 lead, 
but something wasn’t right. 
Laskutova took a game. Then 
another. The chants that filled 
the arena for so long turned 
to 
deafening 
silence 
and 

frustration. Regardless, Fahey 
found a way to persevere, taking 
the next two games in dominant 
fashion to win the match.

“I 
think 
looking 
at 
the 

scoreboard, I really wanted to 
get the point on the board for my 
team,” Fahey said. “So I knew 
I really had to dig deep here 
and win these few games and I 
pulled through mentally.”

Like any tool or weapon, 

Fahey 
and 
Bernstein 
know 

Fahey has to use her voice at 
the right time. While hyping 
her teammates and herself up is 
certainly beneficial, Fahey has 
to be careful to make sure she 
doesn’t give her opponent an 
advantage by letting her hear 
her discontent during a tough 
stretch in a match.

“Sometimes we try and bring 

it down a little 
bit, 
but 
she’s 

definitely got it 
under 
control,” 

Bernstein 
said. 

“It 
can 
be 
a 

problem and she 
can get a little 
too 
hyped 
up. 

When she can 
control it, she’s 
such 
a 
great 

competitor. She 

wants it so much not only for 
herself, but for the team.”

If Fahey can continue to 

control her voice, then the results 
will speak for themselves: There 
will be many more, much louder 
cheers coming from the top 
court and from Wolverines fans 
come postseason time.

‘M’ punches ticket to National Indoors

In true recovery fashion, the 

Michigan women’s tennis team 
came back from a shaky doubles 
performance to earn four points 
in its singles matches and defeat 
Tulsa to tough out a victory in 
the ITA Championship round on 
Sunday afternoon.

Despite losing two out of their 

three doubles, the team rallied 
to win all six of their matches in 
the singles stage, which helped 
the team clinch a spot in the ITA 
National Indoor Round. 

“It’s a huge opportunity for us, 

and these guys did a great job to 
get us there,” said Michigan coach 
Ronni Bernstein. 

A plethora of players stepped up 

in Sunday’s competition, the most 
notable was no. 33 Kate Fahey.

“Going into indoors, I think I’m 

playing really well,” Fahey said. 

Fahey—who was nursing an 

injury—also praised her teammate 

Alyvia Jones, who just joined the 
Wolverines for the start of indoor 
season.

Despite 
struggling 
with 

doubles partner Chiara Lommer, 
Jones rebounded nicely in the 
singles portion of the afternoon, 
winning both of her matches and 
coming through in high-pressure 
situations, including a string of 
five consecutive matches that 
went to deuce.

“I was just trying to be 

aggressive and not focus on it 
being a big point, instead try and 
focus on just trying to win the 
point,” Jones said. 

Jones was also involved in the 

closest match of the afternoon, 
defeating Tamara Kupkova 7-6 (2) 
in her first match before winning 
an abridged second match, 3-0. 
Seeing her teammates’ success 
helped Jones find her own.

“My court was tight and I 

looked around and everyone was 
winning easy,” Jones said. “They 
were carrying the team as I was 

trying to play my match as well.” 

After this win, it is clear 

that Michigan’s top six singles 
competitors — Fahey, Lommer, 
Jones, Mira Ruder-Hook, Alex 
Najarian and Bella Lorenzini — 
are the team’s greatest assets. 
However, they will need to 
improve their performances in 
doubles if they want to make a run 
at a title this season.

Despite its early struggles, the 

team is excited for its opportunity 
to play in the National Indoor 
Round. 
Bernstein 
noted 
to 

reporters 
that 
she 
sees 
the 

tournament as a chance to test her 
young team. 

“Going to the Indoors is always 

special,” she said. “We’re gonna 
have opportunities to play the best 
in the country and see where we 
stack up. The girls are excited, and 
they earned it.”

Of course, the Wolverines have 

much to improve on to find success 
in both the Indoor Round and the 
rest of the season.

Three takeaways: ‘M’ reversing trends after being swept by Ohio State

On a weekend when everything 

could go wrong against fifth-
ranked Ohio State (10-5-1 Big Ten, 
17-5-4 overall), it did.

The No. 20 Michigan hockey 

team (7-9-2, 12-12-2) lost all 
momentum it had built up over 
the past two weeks in dramatic 
fashion. The Daily breaks down 
three takeaways from a dismal 
weekend in Columbus.

Not so special teams
On 
the 
weekend, 
the 

Wolverines went on the power 
play seven times, with no goals to 
show for it.

“We didn’t have one (power 

play) for the longest time,” said 
Michigan coach Mel Pearson 
after the game Saturday. “I think 
they had three to our zero there 
for the longest time and … we 
had some good looks. Even on the 
five-on-three Jack Becker was all 
alone on the side of the net, and 
we’ve got to put those in.”

In Michigan’s 4-0 loss Friday 

night, the Buckeyes went on 
the power play three times and 
managed to capitalize on two of 
them.

While the inability to score on 

the power play isn’t necessarily 
a demarcation of an ailing team, 
the Wolverines’ defense on the 
man-disadvantage was certainly 
problematic.

Ohio State forward Mason 

Jobst even scored a short-handed 
goal in the third period Saturday 
that made fans reminisce about 
the Michigan defense at the 
beginning of the season that gave 
up countless breakouts form from 
numerous turnovers.

“We’ve got to be better on the 

power play,” Pearson said after 
Friday’s loss. “I think that’s an 
area that I talked a little bit before 
the weekend that that was going 
to be critical here. They scored on 
the power play, and obviously we 
didn’t.”

First line woes
In the Wolverines’ win over

WINNING UGLY

If you spill a drink at a party, 

it’s a party foul.

If the party’s theme was “spill 

your drink,” then, well, you did 
what you had to do and nothing 
more.

For 
the 
beginning 
of 

Monday night’s contest against 
Northwestern, the Michigan 
men’s 
basketball 
team 
was 

exactly in this position. Facing 
the Wildcats’ zone defense, 
the Wolverines started 1-for-
12 from three and coughed 
up the ball four times in the 
first 15 minutes, while also 
missing a number of defensive 
assignments.

Michigan was metaphorically 

spilling all over itself after an 
offensive onslaught in its loss 
to Purdue on Thursday. Luckily 
for the Wolverines, a wholly 
lackluster 
performance 
was 

still just enough. Northwestern 
(4-6 Big Ten, 13-10 overall) were 
almost equally abysmal from 
the field — they shot 18-for-
47 for the game with Scottie 
Lindsey as the lone double-digit 
scorer — and simply ran out of 
counter-punches, giving No. 24 
Michigan (7-4, 18-6) room to 
leave with an uninspiring 58-47 
victory.

“I didn’t think after the first 

10 minutes of that game that 
I’d be walking in here with a 
W,” said Michigan coach John 
Beilein as he entered the press 
room. “… They punched us in the 
mouth in the beginning and it 
took us a while to get used to it. 
I’m really pleased we came back 
and made some shots, but our 
defense … it was exceptional.”

Added Northwestern coach 

Chris Collins: “I thought our 
guys competed, we just couldn’t 
put it in the basket. Some of 
that was us, I thought we shot 

ourselves in the foot sometimes. 
Some ill-advised turnovers. But 
it was also Michigan. They were 
very physical, organized and 
made it tough on us.”

Besides 
3-point 
shooting 

woes, the Wolverines were 
even struggling to stick to 
the basics in the first half. On 
two separate occasions after 
collective defensive rebounds, 
Michigan threw the ball away 
before having the chance to 
normally bring it up the court. 
Duncan Robinson was involved 
in one of those instances, and 
it served as a microcosm of the 
Wolverines’ woeful half. The 
fifth-year senior forward shot 
0-for-5 from beyond the arc, but 
also converted three open looks 
in the paint for a team-high of 
just six points in Michigan’s 
21-19 halftime lead.

“We were up two at half. 

Are you kidding me?” Beilein 
said. “We didn’t make shots, we 
didn’t make foul shots but we 
held them and that was the key 
to win.”

In the following half, the 

game’s theme switched from 
just playing bulwark defense 
to adding some offense. The 
Wolverines scored in their first 
four possessions, but even the 
Wildcats were finding luck 
after nine consecutive scoreless 
minutes, starting 5-for-9 to 
keep the game close.

“One, we had to get more stops 

on the defensive end and then 
get out in transition and two, we 
couldn’t just settle for threes,” 
said redshirt sophomore wing 
Charles 
Matthews. 
“When 

they threw a zone at us at the 
beginning, we just gotta rocket-
line it, we still have to go to the 
paint and get two feet in.”

As a result, it took about 

11 minutes for the teams to 
surpass their total first half 
outputs. In that span, junior 

forward Moritz Wagner made 
his presence known with a spot-
up trey and a mid-range leaner 
after registering a scoreless first 
half. He also surprised with his 
defense as his matchup, Wildcat 
forward 
Dererk 
Pardon, 

couldn’t get anything going on 
the other end and was held to 
just nine points.

It was Matthews, though, 

who was able to inject life and let 
the Wolverines get comfortable. 
He came through with two 
emphatic dunks and a 3-pointer 
to widen Michigan’s lead to the 
point of no return. Mathews 
and senior guard Muhammad-
Ali Abdur-Rahkman were the 
Wolverines’ only double-digit 
scorers, with 14 and 11 points, 
respectively.

“We knew their zone was 

gonna give us space in the 
beginning and we hadn’t seen 
anything like that in a while,” 
Abdur-Rahkman said. “We just 
had to adjust to it and once we 
did we were fine.”

It surely wasn’t pretty — few 

games have been that way for 
Michigan recently. But in the 
case of Monday’s game, the 
Wolverines did exactly what 
they needed to do.

Just last week, the Michigan 

men’s basketball team gave up 
92 points.

No. 3 Purdue torched the 

Wolverines, doing whatever it 
wanted offensively.

That performance stuck in 

the minds of No. 24 Michigan, 
and 
it 
showed 
Monday, 

when the Wolverines played 
Northwestern.

The Wildcats were mystified 

offensively, shooting 38 percent 
from the floor, turning the ball 
over 16 times and losing, 58-47 
— tied for the second fewest 
points the Wolverines have 
given up this season.

“This 
whole 
game, 
this 

whole press conference, should 
be about our defense. It was 
exceptional,” Beilein said. “I 
don’t want to get into rating it 
against others, but I told our 
guys, it’s as good as we’ve played 
right now, and it had to be.”

The defense had no choice 

but to step up with how much 
Michigan 
struggled 
on 
the 

offensive end, namely in the 
first half. It scored a paltry 21 
points and shot 36 percent. Its 

leading scorer, fifth-year senior 
forward Duncan Robinson, had 
just six points on three-of-eight 
shooting.

If the Wolverines’ defense 

hadn’t shown up, they might 
have been run out of the gym 
by that point. Luckily for them, 
it did.

Junior 
forward 
Moritz 

Wagner 
has 
been 
much 

maligned 
for 
his 
defensive 

ineptitude. Against Purdue, he 
was bullied by its center, Isaac 
Haas. But Monday, Wagner held 
Northwestern 
center 
Dererk 

Pardon to just nine points and 
added two steals in the process.

“It was great,” Beilein said. 

“Guarding Haas is just like a 
whole different, it’s just very 
difficult. All these years, I’ve 
never seen anything like it. And 
so, that is not who (Wagner) is. 
At the same time, he was really 
good on Pardon, and Pardon is a 
really good player.”

It wasn’t just Wagner who 

stepped up for the Michigan 
defense. 
Sophomore 
guard 

Zavier Simpson was a pest, 
as usual, and junior forward 
Charles Matthews led the team 
with three steals. Even Robinson 
and 
freshman 

guard 
Jordan 

Poole 
— 
who 

have 
struggled 

defensively 
in 
the 
past 

— 
earned 

compliments 
from 
Beilein 

after the game.

The 
Purdue 

loss 
aside, 

stout defense is 
slowly becoming paramount to 
the Wolverines’ identity. They 
have the 25th-best defensive 
efficiency 
rating, 
according 

to KenPom, and have held 
opponents in the 50s and low-
60s more consistently.

That’s not typical of a Beilein-

coached team. Yet it’s something 
that other teams are beginning 
to take notice of.

“Normally, for them, they 

don’t win a game 58-47,” said 
Northwestern 
coach 
Chris 

Collins. “So it just shows that 
they’ve made a lot of strides on 
that end of the floor, and I was 
impressed with their defense 
tonight.”

It seems like that statement 

would make sense for any team. 
Scoring less than 58 points is not 
a recipe for success.

Still, 
the 
sentiment 
that 

Michigan now has the ability to 
win the grind-it-out games is an 
important one. The Wolverines 
have shown this season that 
they are prone to bad games 
on offense. There have been 
countless times when they’ve 
come out slow in the first half, 
hung around with tough defense 
and roared back in the second 
20 minutes.

Tuesday, that was once again 

the case.

“It just shows how resilient 

we are,” Abdur-Rahkman said. 
“We come to work every day, 
we fight hard, we practice hard 

and it shows in 
the end.”

Resilience 

may be the key 
for 
Michigan 

offensively. 
Eventually, 
it 

will 
have 
to 

make more shots 
and consistently 
flash 
the 

offensive 
prominence 

that was present in its games 
against Michigan State and the 
Boilermakers.

Until 
that 
time 
comes, 

though, 
the 
Wolverines’ 

defense is keeping them rolling 
along. 

No. 24 Michigan trudges to victory over Northwestern
Defense leads Wagner, Wolverines to low-scoring win

recent successes that the team 

has seen – both senior forwards 
Dexter Dancs and junior Cooper 
Marody scored, with senior Tony 
Calderone recording two assists.

However, the line that has 

notched 76 points thus far this 
season was silent this weekend.

“We have to get back to our 

game and manage the puck 
better,” Pearson said. “ … You 
can see the goals that they got 
this weekend, we got caught out 
of position, we’re thinking too 
much on the offense, we turned 
the puck over in some bad spots 
that led to some of their goals.”

But historically the other lines 

would be able to pick up the slack 
for the top line from the likes of 
sophomore Jake Slaker and even 
from freshman defender Quinn 
Hughes.

The pair produced a late goal 

in the third period Saturday, but 
it wasn’t enough.

Despite a respectable 63 shots 

on the weekend, they were either 
unworthy of finding the back of 
the net or stopped by Buckeye 
goaltender Sean Romero.

“We created a couple things, 

but we just made the wrong play,” 
Pearson said Friday. “We have 

two or three options that we try 
and give the guys and then you 
have to play off of that and tonight 
it just seemed like the option was 
available to us, we just picked the 
wrong one.”

Added Calderone: “Yeah, we 

started off pretty well, I think 
we were getting pucks to the 
net, but they did a very good job 
of collapsing in the middle, and 
we didn’t get to the greasy areas 
enough.”

Romero, along with the rest 

of Ohio State’s defensive front, 
certainly had something to do 
with the Wolverines squandering 
some of their best options, as 
nothing seemed to work no 
matter how creative Pearson and 
the offense got.

Michigan will be facing more 

elite goaltenders such as No. 2 
Notre Dame’s Cale Morris and 
will have to figure out how to 
work out its offensive struggles.

Lackluster Lavigne
At the start of the calendar 

year, 
sophomore 
goaltender 

Hayden Lavigne all but solidified 
his spot as the go-to keeper. And, 
his performances in the past 
two weeks have been nothing 
short of miraculous, as his leaps 

across the crease have secured 
victories and strengthened a 
faulty defense.

If his recent efforts mean 

anything, it’s that he was the 
undeniable leader of the back 
line.

So, it may be reasonable to 

place some of the blame on him 
for the nine goals allowed against 
Ohio State.

Everyone knows the level 

that Lavigne can play at, and an 
all-around 
poor 
performance 

on both ends of the ice is 
ultimately the reason for why the 
Wolverines lost.

But nine pucks did find their 

way past him, and everyone on 
the ice is accountable for that.

“I think we were a little bit off-

sync tonight,” Calderone said, “so 
I think once we can get in-sync 
and 
everyone’s 
cooperating 

together I think we’ll be fine.”

Ultimately, there were high 

expectations going into the bout 
against the Buckeyes and this 
weekend was certainly a misstep, 
but if Michigan can fix the power 
play and get back to the hockey 
they were playing two weeks ago, 
Calderone’s “we’ll be fine” will 
ring true.
