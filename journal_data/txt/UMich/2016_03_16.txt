the statement

April concert part 
of nationwide tour 

spurred by BDS 

protests

By ALYSSA BRANDON

Daily News Editor 

Reggae artist Matisyahu will 

touch on several themes relevant 
to current campus discourse in 
his April 4 at Hill Auditorium, 
themed around peace and unity.

In an interview with The 

Michigan Daily, Matisyahu said 
he began to conceptualize the 
theme of his campus tour of 12 
universities after being implored 
to make an anti-Israel comment at 
a music festival last summer.

Matisyahu 
said 
after 
he 

declined to make the comments, 
he was thrown off of the festival, 
which caused significant uproar 
both in and outside of Spain from 
his supporters and fans. Despite 
the controversy, he said he was 
invited to perform in Spain again, 
though Boycott, Divestment and 

Sanctions Movement protesters 
heckled 
him 
throughout 
the 

performance. BDS advocates for 
the end of United States public 
funding to Israel and boycotts 
institutions 
that 
financially 

support Israel, in protest of 
what they say is Israel’s ongoing 
restriction of Palestinian rights.

“They wanted me to make 

a political statement basically 
denouncing Israel and promoting 
Palestine. They did it specifically 
because I’m Jewish and because 
they had gotten pressure from the 
BDS movement.”

He said he initially felt angry 

toward the protesters and wanted 
to fight back against them, but 
as 
he 
continued 
performing 

throughout 
night, 
his 
anger 

turned to compassion. 

“I realized what these people, 

regardless what they think or what 
they’ve been taught or what they 
feel, they are right now susceptible 
to the sounds, to the actual waves 
that are coming forth and there 
was no escaping that,” he said. 
“I thought if I can somehow sing 
from a place and make music from

Event features 
panel discussion 
on international 

economics

By TIMOTHY COHN

Daily Staff Reporter

On 
Tuesday, 
the 
Center 

for Japanese Studies hosted a 
discussion with Shuji Shimokoji, 
the former Japanese ambassador 

to Venezuela and Panama. The 
event, “Walk in the U.S., Talk on 
Japan,” was part of a national 
discussion series sponsored by 
the Office of the Prime Minister 
of Japan that aims to increase 
awareness about the relationship 
between the U.S. and Japan.

The panel, attended by about 

30 people, focused on the close 
economic 
ties 
between 
the 

United States and Japan as well 
as the importance of continued 
cooperation in the development of 
security policies.

Shimokoji was joined by a 

panel that included public sector 
officials such as Dr. Toshiyuki 
Miyawaki, a former Major General 
in the Japanese Air Self-Defense 
Force, as well as individuals 
from the private sector, such as 
Hirokichi Nadachi, a prominent 
businessman in the Japanese 
automotive industry and Takaki 
Minamoto, a former investment 
banker for Morgan Stanley and 
current CEO of a Tokyo-based 
tourism agency. Saho Miyashita, a 
Japanese college student who has 

studied in the United States, also 
participated in the panel.

In their opening addresses, 

each panelist spoke about their 
areas of expertise and how their 
experiences could help promote 
greater understanding of relations 
between Japan and the United 
States.

Shimokoji 
highlighted 
the 

Japanese government’s economic 
policies, which he said are aimed 
at 
encouraging 
collaboration 

between the United States and

University Housing 

security director 

was involved in Aura 

Rosser case

By RIYAH BASHA

Daily Staff Reporter

It’s been a little more than 

six months since John Seto, the 
former police chief of Ann Arbor, 
took over as the University of 
Michigan’s 
housing 
security 

director — and some students 
still aren’t comfortable with his 
appointment.

“Students should have input 

into that aspect of control in 
their life,” Rackham student Pete 
Haviland-Eduah, vice president 
of Students of Color of Rackham 
wrote in an e-mail interview. “As 
a person of color, I am concerned 
with his hiring because of what 
happened with Aura last year.” 

For 
many 
community 

organizers in Ann Arbor, time can 
often be marked as before Aura 
and after Aura. In November 

2014, Aura Rosser, a 40 year-old 
Black woman, was fatally shot by 
Officer David Ried, a white Ann 
Arbor police officer, in what was 
determined to have been self-
defense

The shooting, and subsequent 

decision to not indict Ried, 
sparked protests and petitions 
amid national outcry against 
police brutality that began with 
the August 2014 shooting of 
Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. 
The incident is still the motivation 
for many Black activists in the 
city; the Ann Arbor Alliance for 
Black Lives, initially Ann Arbor 
to Ferguson, was founded in 
the wake of Rosser’s death in 
November 2014.

The key distinction in Ann 

Arbor, however, is that activism 
related 
to 
the 
shooting 
as 

largely remained restricted to 
organizations operating in Ann 
Arbor at large, rather than student 
groups on campus. Save for 
tweets by the Black Student Union 
and organizations partnering in 
solidarity, there didn’t seem to be 
many large-scale apparent effects

State Sen. Rick Jones 
introduces legislation 
to decrease power of 
college administrators

By TIMOTHY COHN

Daily Staff Reporter

Last Tuesday, Michigan State 

Sen. Rick Jones (R–Grand Ledge) 
introduced Senate Bill 0848, 

which aims to establish guidelines 
for how universities may or may 
not censor student publications 
and to provide protection for 
student journalists.

The 
Student 
Free 
Press 

and Civics Readiness Act was 
co-sponsored by Sen. Patrick 
Colbeck (R–Canton), Sen. Tom 
Casperson 
(R–Escanaba), 
and 

Sen. Steven Bieda (D–Warren).

Jones, the primary sponsor of 

the bill, cited frequent cases of 
censorship of student journalists 

at Michigan State University as 
the cause for introducing the 
Student Free Press and Civics 
Readiness Act.

“I was approached by students 

from 
MSU 
who 
expressed 

concerns over censorship,” he 
said in an interview. “I want 
their constitutional rights to be 
observed.”

Senate 
Bill 
0848 
includes 

provisions

officials from regulating content

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

ON THE DAILY 

Michigan’s primary may be 

over, but at least one political 
group isn’t willing to let its 
influence in the election fade just 
yet.

A new anti-Trump Snapchat 

geofilter spread across Ohio 
State University’s campus this 
week drawing on the football 
rivalry between the University 
of Michigan and OSU, reading 
“Trump Loves Michigan, Say 
No to Trump.” An animation of 
Trump’s hair sits on the letter 
“C” in “Michigan,” and the letter 
”O” in “No” resembles Ohio 
State’s block O. The geofilter was 
paid for by American Future 
Fund, according to a disclaimer 
on the image.

Ohio, along with several 

other states, heads to the polls 
Tuesday. Trump, who won the 
Michigan primary on March 8 
with about 36.5 percent of the 
vote, is tied for first in current 

polls with Ohio Governor John 
Kasich with both at about 38 
percent according to Real Clear 
Politics.

American Future Fund is a 

tax-exempt organization that 
advocates a “conservative and 
free market viewpoint.” The 
group has previously spoken 
out against candidates beside 
Trump, including Kasich, with a 
$1 million ad campaign in New 
Hampshire that labelled Kasich 
as an “Obama Republican,” 
according to the New York 
Times.

Michigan was also featured 

in an Ohio T.V. ad from Trump’s 
campaign, 
which argued 
that Kasich had 
spent “most 
of his time 
everywhere 
but Ohio — 
especially 

Michigan”.

The 

Democratic 
candidates 
are also 
running 
a close 
campaign 
in Ohio, 
with polls 
estimating 
that Hillary 
Clinton was 
5 points 
ahead of 
Bernie Sanders, 51 
percent to 46 percent.

Attendees express 
frustration with 
current University 

services

By GRACE CANFIELD

For the Daily

A vigil held Tuesday evening 

on the Diag aimed to provide 
students with a forum to talk about 
how mental health is handled on 
campus.

About 15 students gathered in 

front of Hatcher Graduate Library 
for the vigil in response to the 
death of a student Monday night.

Word of the vigil was spread 

mainly through the anonymous 
social media app Yik Yak, which 
students on campus use frequently 
for everything from questions 
about campus life to posts about 
subjects of mental health. 

At Tuesday’s vigil, students 

shared experiences of their own 
experiences with mental health, 

along with concerns over the 
stigma on campus surrounding 
depression and self-harm.

A 
common 
theme 
among 

students at the vigil was frustration 
with University of Michigan’s 
Counseling 
and 
Psychological 

Services, the on-campus resource 
for students seeking counseling 
services 
for 
anxiety 
and 

depression, as well as other mental 
health crises.

Engineering 
sophomore 

Jacqueline Malkin described a 
six-week waiting process from 
the time of her initial move to seek 
assistance to her first counseling 
appointment.

“Between when I signed the 

papers and when I got my initial 
consultation, it was three weeks,” 
Malkin said. “I didn’t get to see my 
psychologist for weekly counseling 
… for six weeks after I signed 
papers.”

LSA sophomore Karly Carson 

also expressed frustration with 
how her CAPS counselor helped 
her through her anxiety.

“She told me I had to stop 

thinking that way,” Carson said. 
“She told me, ‘You’re stressed out, 
we’re all stressed out, you need to 
get over it,’ basically.”

She 
added 
that 
University 

Health Service ultimately provided 
more assistance.

“I also used UHS, and they were 

a lot more helpful to me, as far as 
medication goes,” Carson said. 
“The psychologist I saw was very 
helpful. She helped me learn to … 
basically meditate, and just to calm 
down.”

1,130 individuals had signed an 

online petition as of Wednesday 
morning calling on the University 
to to increase mental health service.

Many students had suggestions 

during the vigil for alternatives 
to address campus mental health 
besides services like CAPS and 
UHS. Liz Zhang, Social Work and 
Public Health graduate student, 
said she believes the answer lies 
with the student body.

“CAPS can’t be the only answer. 

It is like the formal way of thinking 
about mental health,” Zhang said. 
“Overall, change needs to happen 
bottom-up, grassroots, to really 
change the culture.”

Engineering 
sophomore 

Michael Oshatz echoed those 
sentiments.

“We need a culture here of 

caring,” Oshatz said. “We really 
need to stop being cutthroat with 
each other. We need to really 
realize that this is a huge university 
— people get lonely. It’s not an easy 
thing to do to change a culture like 
that, but it’s the only thing we can 
do, I think, is to change the way we 
look at each other.”

Dr. Todd Sevig, director of 

CAPS, wrote in an e-mail the 
Mental Health Service held extra 
hours Tuesday.

“Whenever a student dies, it’s 

such a great loss to our community, 
and we need to support each 
other in extra ways,” Sevig wrote. 
“CAPS had additional walk in crisis 
counselors available today, and we 
are in the process of setting group 
support with Residence Education 
staff. We also have been consulting 
with others who are supporting 

At vigil, students discuss their 
experiences with mental health

Central Student Government 
talks online presence of CAPS

Body also passes 

resolution on tuition 
for undocumented 
graduate students

By ANNA HARITOS

Daily Staff Reporter

At 
Tuesday’s 
meeting, 

representatives of the University 
of Michigan’s Central Student 
Government discussed funding 
and the University Counseling 
and 
Psychological 
Services’ 

website, as well as passing a 
resolution 
on 
undocumented 

and 
non-traditional 
graduate 

students.

The meeting opened with LSA 

senior Jacob Ruby, chair of the 
Student Organization Funding 
Commission at the University, 
updating the council on SOFC’s 
progress 
in 
regard 
to 
the 

distribution of money among 
student clubs and organizations.

“Thanks 
to 
the 
online 

application 
the 
quality 
of 

requests for funding has gone 
up,” he said. “We had $500,000 
in requests last semester, and 
so far this semester we already 
have $750,000 in requests. If we 
stick within our range we won’t 
be giving out very much money 
to student orgs, but we will not 
go over our budget.”

The topic of funding did not 

stop with Ruby’s executive 
report. Business junior Ben 
Meisel, chair of CSG’s Finance 
Committee, 
introduced 
a 

new resolution to alter the 
distribution of the CSG budget. 
If the suggested budget is 
passed, just under $7,000 will 
be moved from CSG’s General 
Account 
to 
the 
Legislative 

Discretionary 
Account. 
The 

money in the latter account 

would be used toward student 
resources like St. Patrick’s Day 
dining hours and hand dryers in 
the C.C. Little Science Building.

Meisel 
said 
he 
thought 

the shift would impact how 
accessible CSG funds were to 
the student body.

“I believe we’ve done amazing 

work so far this semester as a 
funding body,” he said. “We 
have more things coming up 
and 
representatives 
excited 

about improving the student 
body. Finances shouldn’t stop 
them if it is within the means 
of our organization. It’s a no 
brainer to me that we should 
create accessibility to use money 
that was given by students for 
students.”

Additionally, a resolution to 

allocate funds for the MUSIC 
Matters 
2016 
concert 
went 

through first review by the 
assembly. 
Business 
senior 

Jibran Ahmed, MUSIC Matters 
president, 
said 
increasing 

funding to his organization 
could help improve the quality 
of events and activities held for 
SpringFest on April 13. 

“The costs for this year’s 

festival will be higher than 
they were in the past,” he said. 
“We give money to student 
organizations that want to 
do more, but we are running 
into issues. So the money 
would be allocated to those 
specific organizations as a way 
to create more engaging and 
entertaining events.”

Among 
new 
business 

discussed was a resolution 
to 
have 
CSG 
encourage 

CAPS to improve its website. 
The 
resolution 
states 
that 

the 
current 
website 
does 

not present a clear way for 
students to go about making 
an appointment or accessing 

additional 
resources. 
The 

resolution will be reviewed 
further at CSG’s next meeting.

Ford senior Sloane Forbush, 

who authored the resolution, 
said the current website is not 
user-friendly. The resolution 
proposes that CAPS to adopt 
a format similar to that of 
the Ohio State University’s 
Psychological Services website, 
which Forbush said has better 
organization and structure.

LSA junior Cam Dotson, 

co-author of the resolution, 
echoed her remarks.

“Students who are going 

through 
these 
traumatic 

experiences don’t want click 
through all these links,” he said 
“We want to ease the service, 
make it easier to use and make 
finding help through CAPS 
more accessible.”

During 
the 
community 

concerns section of the meeting, 
six individuals came to address 
the chamber on a resolution 
to encourage the University 
to extend in-state tuition to 
undocumented graduate and 
non-traditional 
students 
in 

Michigan. The assembly passed 
the resolution.

One 
of 
the 
speakers, 

Ph.D. candidate Persephone 
Hernandez-Vogt, 
said 
it’s 

important for non-traditional 
students in Michigan to have 
affordable tuition.

“It’s wonderful that this is 

available to undergraduates, but 
it’s so important that everyone 
has access to it,” she said. “It 
would offer more affordable 
opportunities to undocumented

that can be published except when 
the articles are either libelous, an 
unwarranted invasion of privacy, 
in violation of federal or state law 
or capable of inciting students so 
as to create a clear and present 
danger. 

Section 5 of the Student Free 

Press and Civics Readiness Act 
establishes 
a 
framework 
for 

schools to customize their student 
publication guidelines under a 
freedom of expression policy. 
The policy can enable school 
authorities to further regulate the 
material that is published. 

“Each school district shall 

adopt a written student freedom 
of expression policy in accordance 
with this act,” the policy says. “The 
policy must include reasonable 
provisions for the time, place, and 
manner of student expression. 

The policy may also include 
limitations on language that is 
profane, harassing, threatening, 
or intimidating.”

Also included in the bill is a 

provision that provides immunity 
from disciplinary action for both 
student journalists and student 
media advisers for writing and 
publishing content that is not 
prohibited by the law, or by the 
school’s freedom of expression 
policy. The bill defines student 
media advisers as individuals 
who 
act 
as 
instructors 
for 

student journalists, or officials 
who supervise the newspaper’s 
publication.

The provision aims to prevent 

articles from being arbitrarily 
regulated 
by 
a 
school, 
or 

establishment of higher learning.

CENSORSHIP
From Page 1A

focused on the student body.

That is, until last summer.
Seto was the police chief of Ann 

Arbor at the time of Rosser’s death, 
and steadfastlydefended the police 
officer in question throughout the 
Washtenaw County prosecutor’s 
short 
investigation. 
He 
also 

oversaw 
the 
introduction 
of 

diversity awareness training and 
body cameras to the city police 
force, while affirming that Reid 
acted in self-defense.

Seto retired from the Ann 

Arbor Police Department the 
July after Rosser’s death, with a 
resume totalling a 25-year-long 
career in law enforcement — a 
career that began in University 
of Michigan Housing. When the 
Division of Public Security and 
Safetyannounced at the beginning 
of the 2015 school year that Seto 
would return out of retirement 
to lead his old department as the 
director 
of 
Housing 
Security, 

University officials applauded his 
decision. Eddie Washington, the 
executive director of DPSS, cited 
Seto’s partnership on student 
safety initiatives in particular at 
the time of his hiring.

“Throughout his service, he 

built a strong record of leadership, 
community 
engagement 
and 

collaboration,” Washington wrote 
in an e-mail interview with the 
Daily.

More than a semester later, 

though, Seto’s position at the 
University remains a point of 
contention for student activists. 
Rackham student Maryam Aziz, 
an Ann Arbor Alliance for Black 
Lives organizer, denounced Seto’s 
hiring last summer, and said on 
March 9 she still stands by her 
critiques of his stances.

“It’s the fact that he’s unwilling 

to acknowledge or affirm people’s 
assertions that he took part in her 
death,” she said. “Even bigger than 
him, it’s the fact that someone who 
is in a position of power in the city 
can invalidate people’s concerns.”

Seto declined comment on cases 

he worked on for the city.

For some students, however, the 

issue goes beyond the specific case 
at hand, and to a potential larger 
disconnect between DPSS and 
students of color.

Rackham student Alina Kazmi, 

SCOR’s 
political 
action 
chair, 

said she recognizes that Seto had 
proper experience for the job, but 
added that she takes issue with the 
lack of student consultation during 
the hiring process.

“This is not the only time 

students have a lot of questions 
around a pretty significant moment 
for the University,” she said. “The 
only reason we could see was that 
there is not any transparency in 
the hiring process. You would 
think they don’t just pull someone 
out of thin air. From what I 
can tell, from the University’s 
perspective, John Seto was a great 
pick because he had a longstanding 
relationship with the University. 
Aura Rosser didn’t, though she was 
a community member.”

Aziz agreed, and questioned 

whether students of color had 
an adequate voice in a matter as 
personal as housing.

“If police are here at a public 

university to make people feel safe, 
how are students, administrators, 
non-law-enforcement people at 
large involved in saying ‘this is how 
you make me feel safe’ in spaces 
here?” she asked.

At a policing forum hosted 

by BSU and SCOR last Saturday, 
however, Seto disputed reports of 
discomfort, maintaining he has 
experienced an easy transition 
back to the Housing Security office.

“I have yet to experience any 

discomfort from students,” he said. 
“I am here to listen and connect 
with members of the community.”

Haviland-Eduah, 
who 

organized 
the 
forum 
and 

introduced the event, wrote in 
an e-mail interview that Seto’s 
comments were indicative of the 
need for more student involvement 
in DPSS processes.

“This lack of awareness only 

underscores the importance that 
now more than ever, we need 
work with administrators across 
the campus to create levels of 
accountability and institutionalize 
student involvement in hiring 
processes that have the potential to 
impact student life tremendously,” 
he wrote.

Nonetheless, for undergraduate 

students 
at 
large 
living 
in 

University Housing, there seems to 
be a different gulf in understanding 
— though many are aware of 
Rosser’s death, Seto’s name is 

unfamiliar to most.

LSA senior Brittany Dowe, a 

resident advisor in Martha Cook 
Residence Hall, is a diversity peer 
educator in her hall. Dowe works 
closely with University Housing 
in 
developing 
workshops 
on 

inclusivity and identity, but had 
no knowledge of Seto’s association 
with the University.

“Going through my training, we 

never heard about him or met him,” 
she said. “We always interacted 
with people a couple units down.”

LSA freshman Mariam Doudi 

lives in South Quad Residence 
Hall, and said she was never 
educated on civil rights issues in 
the city, let alone the connections 
to University life.

“In my time so far, those aren’t 

issues that have been emphasized 
to me as important,” she said. 

Over the past year, DPSS as a 

whole has made several efforts 
to reach out to students as a part 
of 
University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel’s diversity initiative. In 
addition to events put on by student 
organizers such as the policing 
forum, the division created a 
new position, diversity program 
manager, and Washington is in 
the process of creating a student 
advisory board contributing to all 
offices within DPSS.

Despite 
these 
reforms, 

University 
safety 
officers 

themselves acknowledge students 
of color may still not be able to 
fully trust law enforcement. Bryan 
Baker, DPSS liaison to the Division 
of Student Life, said at the forum 
security officers’ uniforms can 
make students feel uncomfortable.

“From 
personal 
experience, 

I’ve had people that haven’t come 
up to me, or shied away from me 
and that’s OK,” he said. “But we’re 
making an effort to build those 
relationships in residence halls 
especially.”

Though Haviland-Eduah does 

not live in University housing, 
he wrote that Seto’s role at the 
University pushed him to ask more 
questions about students’ input 
with DPSS.

“I think about what could 

happen if I have an interaction 
with the police, and I want to trust 
that I will have a good interaction, 
but that’s not always the case, 
especially as a Black man,” he 
wrote.

Japan, citing the Trans-Pacific 
Partnership. 
The 
TPP 
is 
an 

international 
trade 
agreement 

which 
aims 
to 
reduce 
trade 

obstacles between countries on the 
Pacific Rim and increase economic 
growth passed in February 2016. 
The ambassador also focused his 
talk on the close ties between the 
two countries in the development 
of mutually beneficial security 
policies that address concerns over 
China and North Korea.

“To further boost the economy 

of Japan and the United States, 
international trade is paramount,” 
he 
said. 
“The 
Trans-Pacific 

Partnership, so called TPP, will 
help open up Japanese markets 
to more goods — that will benefit 
the participating economies and 
newly emerging economies in Asia 
and elsewhere. A strong Japanese 
economy is one way that we can 
both benefit.”

Nadachi 
spoke 
about 
his 

experiences 
in 
international 

business, saying American business 
ethics are the best in the world and 
encouraging further cooperation 
between the United States and 
Japan.

Dr. Miyawaki’s remarks centered 

on the long history of cooperation 
between the U.S. military and the 
Japanese self-defense force. 

“America 
has 
many 

commitments all over the world, 
with tensions in the Middle East 
and elsewhere,” Miyawaki said. 
“But I would also argue not to 
forget the importance of the Asian 
Pacific region.”

Dr. 
Miyawaki 
cited 
North 

Korea’s growing nuclear ambitions 
and growing tensions in countries 
around the South China Sea as 
examples of potential conflicts that 
require U.S. attention.

Beyond 
foreign 
policy, 
the 

discussion also pivoted to cultural 
issues. Miyashita spoke about the 
similar agricultural focus of the 
two nations, noting concerns about 
the large aging population of Fukui 
and the relatively small youth 
population in her region, a problem 
that is common throughout Japan.

The theme of cultural similarities 

was also reflected in Minamoto’s 
introduction. In his address, he 
spoke to the importance of bowing 
in Japanese culture. He noted the 
similarity between the American 
handshake and the Japanese bow 
as both being symbolic of mutual 
respect.

Following 
the 
panelists’ 

introductions, the group took 
questions from the audience, which 
mainly focused on economic and 
security 
issues. 
One 
audience 

member asked about relations 
between China and Japan in 
particular. In response, Shimokoji 
said there needs to be increased 
cooperation between Japan and 
China.

“China 
and 
Japan 
must 

cooperate 
together,” 
said 

Shimokoji. “China is not an enemy 
of Japan’s, but rather competitors.”

In 
an 
interview 
after 
the 

event, 
Shimokoji 
emphasized 

that cooperation with China was 
important to counter North Korean 
nuclear ambitions. 

“Even now, China is against 

North Korean nuclear facilities,” 
he said. “So we have to encourage 
China to help curtail the operation 
of these North Korean nuclear 
facilities.”

Shimokoji also noted that he 

thought Japan should strengthen 
ties with Latin America.

“I think that Japan should 

strengthen 
their 
work 
with 

Venezuela, especially in energy 
markets and with other resources,” 
Shimokoji said. “Not only in 
Venezuela however; Brazil and 
Peru are very important countries 
to Japan.”

a place of compassion some kind 
of human place from within, 
whether it be about struggle or 
whatever it is, people can relate 
to that, and they can feel we’re all 
sort of connected in some way.”

That experience of a BDS 

protest, he said, is what prompted 
him to focus on unity in the U.S.

“I went back and I performed 

and I performed in front of a bunch 
of BDS boycotters with signs that 
said things like ‘Naziyahu’ and 
they were throwing stuff on stage 
and screaming at me and cursing 
at me and it was pretty intense,” 
he said. “So I have this direct 
involvement 
with 
interacting 

with the BDS and I got to see sort 
of how it resonates in people and 
I felt like the same things were 
happening in the states.”

Rap artist Nadim Azzam will 

be also be a part of the April 
concert, which is sponsored by 
University of Michigan Hillel 
and planned by MUSIC Matters. 
It will be exclusively for faculty, 
students and staff, with attendees 
required to present valid Mcards 
in order to purchase tickets.

Members 
of 
the 
MUSIC 

Matters 
executive 
board 

said 
Hillel 
contacted 
their 

organization in January with the 
opportunity to host Matisyahu’s 
Michigan tour stop. Business 
senior Jibran Ahmed, president 
of MUSIC Matters, said the group 
saw the concert as an opportunity 
to further their mission of uniting 
communities on campus.

“We saw this as an opportunity 

to build community and to 
strengthen community and really, 
that’s what our organization is 
all about,” Ahmed said. “That’s 
why we put on SpringFest, 
that’s why we have the concerts, 
that’s why we have large-scale 
philanthropic efforts, in order 
to build community. This was 
just an incredible opportunity to 
work on.”

According to a press release, 

both Matisyahu and Azzam 
hope through their performance, 
attendees are able to find mutual 
respect for each other and the 
acknowledgement 
of 
human 

similarities will be strengthened.

Business junior Kaitlin Smith, 

MUSIC Matters communications 
chair, said she thinks Matisyahu 
has a reputation for holding 
performances 
in 
front 
of 

distinctively diverse audiences.

“This 
is 
a 
theme 
for 

Matisyahu,” Smith said. “He 
has played at festivals that are 
known for being culturally and 
religiously diverse, so he’s kind of 
taken his message and is applying 
it to this U.S. college tour.”

Matisyahu said this concert 

series is focused on getting 
attendees to reevaluate their 
views on current issues.

“This concert series and these 

shows is really not about politics,” 
he said. “One of the main points 
that I’m trying to come at is it’s 
not about choosing sides, but it’s 
about being honest with yourself 
and trying to learn about all the 
different sides and trying to 

connect to something human.”

Further emphasizing that the 

concert will not take a political 
stance on any issue, he said it 
instead aims to promote peace 
and love through music.

“You can talk about love, you 

can talk about politics, you can 
speak about right and wrong, but 
when it comes to art and to music, 
it bypasses all of it and resonates 
inside of you and makes you feel a 
certain way,” he said.

Azzam echoed Matisyahu’s 

remarks in an interview with 
the Daily last week. Speaking 
specifically to conflicts in Israel 
and Palestine, Azzam said he 
hopes the concert helps attendees 
find connections with people of 
different cultural backgrounds.

“In regards to the sociopolitical 

context of Palestine and Israel, 
things are much more complex 
and intense than a campus 
concert 
series 
can 
address,” 

Azzam said. “But before we can, 
as a society, reconcile differences 
in belief and opinion between 
Palestinians and Israelis, we have 
to first find common ground as 
human beings. And music is one 
powerful way to do that.”

The 
concert’s 
theme 
has 

resonated deeply with some 
students at the University, such 
as LSA senior Daniel Pearlman. 
In an interview, Pearlman said he 
met Matisyahu at a performance 
at The Blind Pig in Ann Arbor 
when he was a freshman, and was 
struck by his inviting demeanor.

He added that he believes the 

symbolism of Jewish-American 
Matisyahu performing alongside 
Arab-American 
Azzam 
will 

have a significant impact on the 
University. 

“Both of their music really 

speaks volumes to me,” Pearlman 
said. “The message of peace 
and coexistence is inspiring 
and especially having a Jewish 
artist and a Palestinian artist 
perform together on campus and 
spreading the message of peace 
and coexistence can really speak 
volumes. I’m really excited for 
this concert.”

Matisyahu 
said 
he 
hopes 

students who attend the concert 
are able to treat it as a learning 
experience.

“I feel that when people come 

to see the show they may have an 
expectation of something, and 
I hope they are able to lose that 
expectation and jump into an 
unknown experience,” he said. 
“I hope they lose themselves 
in it and experience something 
greater than themselves, and I 
know music has the capacity to 
do that.”

Ahmed said he believes the 

rich history of individuals who 
have performed or spoken at Hill 
Auditorium makes it the perfect 
venue for Matisyahu and Azzam’s 
performance.

Many social activists and 

renowned 
musicians 
have 

come to Hill in past years. Most 
recently, Naomi Tutu, daughter 
of Archbishop Desmond Tutu, 
delivered the annual Martin 
Luther King Jr. keynote lecture at 
the auditorium in January.

“There’s 
been 
so 
many 

amazing 
engaging 
speakers 

at Hill Auditorium,” Ahmed 
said. “Martin Luther King Jr. 
spoke at Hill Auditorium. I 
had the privilege to see Nelson 
Mandela’s grandson on the stage. 
Hill is such a historic venue 
that bringing Matisyahu and 
promoting dialogue on that stage 
is the perfect venue.”

LSA junior Matt Fisher, MUSIC 

Matters fundraising chair, said a 
key focus of the event is to inspire 
further discussion about peace 
and unity at the University. Both 
Matisyahu and Azzam will hold 
events to interact with University 
community members the day of 
the concert.

Organizations such as the 

Muslim 
Student 
Association 

and 
the 
Black 
Student 

Union 
have 
recently 
held 

forums and dialogues at the 
University to address topics 
such 
as 
Islamophobia 
and 

intersectionality 
within 
the 

Muslim 
community. 
The 

University is also in the middle 
of 
a 
campus-wide 
diversity 

initiative aimed at addressing 
issues regarding racial climate 
and inclusivity on campus. In 
March 2014 campus also grappled 
with divestment when a group of 
over 100 students, alumni and 
community members held a sit-
in in response to Central Student 
Government postponing a vote 
on whether the University should 
divest. In March 2015 CSG voted 
against divestment.

“It’s all about community 

building and bringing together 
as many different communities 
on campus as possible, creating 
dialogue 
on 
campus 
and 

encouraging students to speak 
with each other in a peaceful 
way,” Fisher said.

Ahmed added that MUSIC 

Matters has reached out to 
various organizations on campus 
and wants students of different 
identities to know they are 
welcome to attend the concert.

“With reaching out to student 

groups, we want to stress that not 
only are all groups welcome, but 
are encouraged to come to the 
show,” Ahmed said. “We really 
think that the dialogue the show 
will create will be very valuable 
to every student on campus.”

Aside from promoting unity 

at the University, Ahmed said 
the concert also serves as an 
extension of MUSIC Matters’ 
overall goal of inspiring the 
community through music.

“The idea on Matisyahu’s 

end on our perspective is to 
show 
how 
powerful 
music 

can be,” Ahmed said. “Music 
creates these dialogues, music 
has the opportunity to build 
these communities, really to 
show music can be used to enact 
positive social change.”

Tickets for the concert can be 

purchased for $5 at the Michigan 
Union Ticket Office with the 
presentation of a valid Mcard. 
Proceeds from the concert will 
go toward MUSIC Matters’ Big 
Thinker Scholarship, the first 
scholarship at the University 
to be completely endowed by 
students.

O

f all the concerning things 
in the world of politics, leg-
islating math has to be one 

of the wildest 
things 
politi-

cians 
could 

try to get away 
with.

Most notori-

ously, a bill in 
Indiana penned 
back 
in 
1897, 

later 
termed 

the “Indiana Pi 
Bill,” was intro-
duced to make a 
certain mathe-
matical method of “squaring the cir-
cle” officially established by law. It’s 
no mistake that “squaring the circle” 
has become a euphemism for doing 
the impossible, because it is, in fact, 
impossible. For whatever reason, 
someone’s erroneous proof some-
how made it into the legislature, 
and if it were to have passed, this 
bill would’ve had weird secondary 
consequences such as technically 
making the value of pi in the state 
of Indiana 3.2 by state law. Clear-
ly, mathematical laws saw that’s 
impossible.

It’s a ridiculous idea — math can’t 

be legislated, as it rests outside the 
domain of the law. Perhaps you could 
chalk that law up to just to its occur-
rence in the 19th century, but even 
today we see direct applications of 
mathematics attempted to be legis-
lated, as state legislatures in Califor-
nia and New York have introduced 
bills that would ban encryption that 
is unbreakable to law enforcement 
in personal devices. Taking it a step 
further, United Kingdom Prime 
Minister David Cameron is on record 
as wishing to ban strong encryption 
entirely, which elicited responses 
from the technical community that 
stated Cameron very literally “had 
no idea what he was proposing.” 
Because at its core, encryption is 
simply a widely available application 
of mathematics, such that Wikipedia 
co-founder Jimmy Wales directly 
compared that a ban on encryption 
would be like banning a form of 
mathematics itself.

Encrypted data is like some secret 

code, used to scramble messages or 
data in way such that it’s unable to be 
read by any unauthorized third party 
who does not have the decryption 
key. It’s publically available in many 
different forms, and when properly 
designed using things like large key-
spaces and other cryptographic tech-
niques, the code becomes extremely 
hard to crack even with millions of 
dollars of computer hardware. In 
the realm of technology, it’s used on 
individual devices to privatize data, 
usually to prevent access by a thief 
or other unauthorized party, but is 
also applied to communications and 
Internet traffic for everyday users 
to prevent others from snooping on 
their activity. In a nutshell, address-
es starting with “https” encrypt the 
transmitted data, while those start-

ing with “http” are unsecured. 

It’s a major defense against tools 

that are used to commit crimes like 
identity theft, which the Depart-
ment of Justice’s Bureau of Justice 
Statistics estimates to affect 17.6 mil-
lion Americans a year at a total cost 
of $15.4 billion. Along with a right 
to privacy, encryption has become 
the backbone of safely using devices 
on the Internet, but it’s this safe pri-
vacy that has caught the ire of law 
enforcement as it prevents them 
from accessing possible evidence 
from devices used by perpetrators.

The debate between privacy advo-

cates and law enforcement came 
to a head this past month when 
Apple published a customer let-
ter announcing they would refuse 
to comply and fight a court order to 
weaken the security on their devic-
es so officials could access a phone 
used by one of the suspects in the 
San Bernadino shooting case. The 
FBI argued it would be a one-time 
deal, while Apple in its customer 
letter said such an action would cre-
ate dangerous standards that would 
undermine the security that pro-

tects all of its customers. While one 
should be sympathetic to the cause 
of investigators in these cases, Apple 
is right.

Since October 2015, government 

authorities have also requested 
access to 12 other iPhones under the 
jurisdiction of the ancient All Writs 
Act of 1789. Despite their insistence 
on needing Apple’s help, 11 of these 
devices run older versions of Apple’s 
iOS software with existing public 
vulnerabilities that would allow 
investigators to extract the data. It 
presents the fact that the FBI and 
investigators aren’t just looking for 
the data: The FBI is looking for a 
precedent that would either weaken 
encryption or insert some “back-
door” into the encryption that would 
allow them access to any phone.

On the surface, it seems OK: The 

authorities could only seize your 
phone with a warrant, and they’re 
the only ones who would be able to 
break the encryption. However, such 
an ideal is a great risk. It’s already 
incredibly difficult to write secure 
software, and writing it in a way 
such that only the “good guys” can 
break through the security is some-
thing that security experts say to be 

somewhere in between impossible 
and an incredible risk. If there is to 
be a solution to this seeming trad-
eoff between rights to privacy and 
impedance of investigations, one 
that involves weakening the privacy 
of everyday consumers and putting 
them at risk of attack from nefari-
ous citizens cannot be it. And bills 
that go to even greater extents, such 
as one being pushed in the United 
Kingdom that would force back-
doors in both device and Internet 
encryption, would have devastating 
effects. Encryption is what makes 
so much of using the Internet, com-
puters and smartphones possible. 
Weaken it and take it away and 
you’ve turned cyberspace into the 
wild west, hurting only the every-
day citizens who rely on their tech-
nology every day.

One of the few congressmen with 

a background in computer science, 
Rep. Ted Lieu (D–Cal.), introduced 
a federal bill that would stop states 
from instituting their own bans on 
the sale of encrypted devices. Such 
bans, despite valid public safety 
concerns that are the cause for their 
introduction, simply aren’t practi-
cal at all, as it’s impossible to stop 
the flow of technology through 
borders, even in places with strong 
laws against it like China does. The 
technical 
community, 
including 

behemoths like Microsoft, Google, 
Bill Gates and many other figures, 
has come out almost unanimously 
in support of Apple in this case. The 
Department of Justice, in a brief, 
even suggested that they could com-
pel Apple to turn over their source 
code to the FBI, presenting a scenar-
io where the government itself could 
write in the backdoors (like they’ve 
already been accused of doing in 
many other pieces of software 
through the National Security Agen-
cy). The fact that these tech com-
panies could be forced to become 
puppets of the justice system to this 
extreme should be alarming, and the 
technical community sees that.

For now, the courts have sided 

with Apple in a similar case, such 
that Apple will not have to introduce 
exploits in their system available 
for use by law enforcement. While 
many lawmakers and citizens will 
try to see nuance in the issue and say 
there must be some middle ground 
between privacy and law, there’s 
an unfortunate reality that in cases 
like these, when it comes to techni-
cal encryption, we’re faced with 
an all-or-nothing approach where 
introducing backdoors or weaken-
ing standards is not a viable solution. 
The cases are tragic, but using them 
as emotional catalysts to seize an 
opportunity to strengthen investiga-
tive positions in a way that harms the 
everyday interactions with technol-
ogy is far more authoritarian than 
the situation warrants.

Race Across Michigan

I

t had been a frantic morning, and there 
was no indication that my mind would be 
any less frenzied any time soon. After a 

three-hour class on North 
Campus, I had a window 
of roughly 35 minutes to 
walk from C.C. Little to my 
apartment across campus, 
switch my lofty art portfo-
lio for my backpack, maybe 
grab a snack before head-
ing out the door and walk 
back to Central to get 
to my class at 1 p.m. An 
emptied coffee thermos 
was firmly gripped in my 
right hand while my left 
was busy ensuring my portfolio — which 
is admittedly almost as long as my body — 
remained securely in its place as it hung 
from my shoulder. The abnormally strong 
wind manipulated the movement of both my 
portfolio and me as I neared the intersec-
tion for my street.

Admittedly, I tend to tune out entirely by 

listening to my iPod whenever I’m walking 
somewhere. Yet, at this moment, calls from 
across the street drowned out my music, 
and I looked to see two men looking at me, 
trying to get my attention, laughing and 
obnoxiously calling out at me to come over 
to their side of the street.

An all-too-familiar uneasiness set in. I 

stood there, waiting for the light to change 
and frustrated by the fact that the path to 
my apartment was going to lead me across 
the street and directly in front of them. I 
tried to ignore the situation until the signal 
changed. Donning a look of indifference, I 
tried to pass by quickly and continue on my 
way. One tried to ask me a question and, when 
I didn’t promptly respond, his companion 
expressed disappointment that I apparently 
“don’t talk.”

I was swallowing every single word.
No, I didn’t talk, because the potential con-

sequences were too ambiguous, and years of 
experience taught me to remain quiet. I con-
tained my frustration until I entered my apart-
ment. My silence and flustered expression as I 
walked in immediately signaled to my room-
mate that something was bothering me. As I 
turned toward the living room, I shouted for a 
brief moment, startling my roommate.

I explained my exasperation, and she 

understood and empathized. It wasn’t the 
first time either one of us had been cat-called, 
and that was the problem. This was far from 
the first time. My experience encountering 
street harassment began right before I start-
ed college, and since then, these moments 
of anxiety and insecurity have grown to be 
a common occurrence. Each instance of cat-
calling or street harassment that I encounter 
leaves me feeling self-conscious, confused 
and frustrated, and I imagine a similar sce-
nario exists for a variety of women.

I complained about the incident to a 

friend via text, and he suggested I had 
enough emotion and material to write an 
article about it. As much as I wanted to, I 
dismissed the idea, arguing that I’d written 
about this topic too much before. Like I said, 
this wasn’t the first time, and I was worried 
I’d start to sound redundant and unoriginal.

A few weeks after I had brushed the sug-

gestion aside, I traveled with another friend 
for Spring Break. As we were walking along 
the street toward the downtown area one 
night to grab dinner, a car honked multiple 
times as it passed by us. Then another car 

full of guys yelled out at us as it drove by. I 
jumped slightly as the second car passed, but 
my friend remained calm and collected. The 
cars were then, of course, a subject of conver-
sation for us while we walked back, but it was 
a short discussion.

She and I were both annoyed by the situ-

ation and the guys’ demeaning behavior. 
But the matter-of-fact tone we both used 
caught my attention. We mentioned the inci-
dent briefly and moved on. It wasn’t novel or 
shocking to us. My friend had warned me that 
tended to happen to her each year she visited 
this particular town for Spring Break.

Our complacent reactions began to bother 

me shortly afterward. Street harassment 
shouldn’t be so ingrained into a woman’s life 
that, to a certain degree, she just expects it, 
shrugging it off nonchalantly whenever it 
does occur. Why was I so worried about dis-
cussing the topic when it obviously wasn’t 
going to dissipate from society any time soon? 
According to a 2014 survey conducted by Stop 
Street Harassment, 65 percent of women 
report experiencing street harassment of 
some form. Additionally, 90 percent of the 811 
respondents in an online 2008 study encoun-
tered street harassment by the age of 19.

While cat-calling may often be associated 

with female victims, it’s certainly not an issue 
exclusive to women. Roughly 25 percent of 
men reported experiencing street harassment 
in the 2014 survey, and of these men, a larg-
er percentage were members of the LGBTQ 
community. Those with marginalized iden-
tities are disproportionately harassed and 
scrutinized in public, whether for their gen-
der, their race, their sexual orientation, their 
religion or their gender identity.

For individuals who experience harassment 

on a regular basis, it’s not a joke. It’s certainly 
not a compliment. It’s a form of an intimida-
tion and a not-so-subtle way of communicating 
that someone doesn’t deserve to feel comfort-
able and safe in the public sphere. There’s 
absolutely no reason why anyone should be 
subjected to objectification and intimidation 
when they’re merely trying to go about their 
day. I don’t care what a woman or a man may 
be wearing. (Though, taking my experience 
into account, I particularly can’t comprehend 
how anyone could claim my oversized sweater 
and messy ponytail were attempts to attract 
attention to myself.)

I write this acknowledging that street 

harassment, or cat-calling, is a societal 
problem with no easy, immediate solution. 
My encounters with this issue began around 
the age of 18 and will most likely continue 
for many more years to come. For others 
from different races, religions and commu-
nities, their experiences may differ vastly in 
severity and frequency. Regardless, these 
experiences need to be recounted and retold 
as frequently as they occur.

Over break, I read essays by Rebecca Sol-

nit, and one section of her essay, “Pandora’s 
Box and the Volunteer Police Force,” stood 
out to me. She writes, “Saying that every-
thing is fine or that it will never get any bet-
ter are ways of going nowhere or of making 
it impossible to go anywhere.”

When my friend first suggested I write 

about street harassment, I thought it was 
redundant and wouldn’t make anything 
better. However, it’s the insistent act of con-
tinually writing and making voices heard 
that leads to significant change.

“Encryption is 
what makes so 

much of using the 
Internet, computers 

and smartphones 

possible.”

O

n Saturday, 65 students, 
myself 
included, 
will 

grudgingly leave the warm 

confines of our 
beds, don running 
tights and various 
thermal 
layers 

and quickly pack a 
change of clothes 
before 
heading 

out into the cold. 
We’ll then meet, 
still slightly dis-
oriented, at the 
Cube 
before 
5 

a.m. to start the 
University 
of 

Michigan Running Club’s 8th annual 
Race Across Michigan.

When I first entered the Uni-

versity in August of 2012, I knew I 
wanted to keep running. Through 
high school, running provided a 
tight-knit community of friends 
and a good way to vanquish the 
seemingly daunting decisions that 
high school students face. Though 
I loved the community, I wasn’t 
sure that I would continue running 
competitively in college. As a reli-
ably mediocre runner who never 
entertained the idea of running at 
a Division III school, winning the 
slow heat at track meets didn’t feed 
such a fantasy.

A sub-par coach through high 

school further fueled my dissolu-

tion. Through the fortune of never 
being injured himself, he expected 
that his athletes would remain 
injury-free, too. This expecta-
tion, in some respects, created an 
unnecessarily 
stressful 
experi-

ence for our whole team.

During welcome week of my 

freshman year, though, another 
student piqued my interest in the 
Michigan Running Club, MRun for 
short. I dithered about first semes-
ter, attending some races and social 
events, but not really having my 
heart set on the club. At the begin-
ning of my second semester, I heard 
about RAM.

Every year, MRun runs 184 miles 

across the state of Michigan from 
Detroit to South Haven along Michi-
gan Avenue in less than 24 hours. We 
run it as a relay, i.e. groups of run-
ners run in 5 to 25 mile shifts. For 
the last five years, we have raised 
money for the Special Olympics of 
Washtenaw County. Though our 
event supports an exceptional orga-
nization, it interests me for another 
more important reason: It encapsu-
lates the very ethos of MRun.

In the 36 or so hours that we are 

together, crammed in University 
vehicles, we have a unique and oth-
erwise unequalled opportunity to 
better MRun’s community. MRun 
includes DI talent to hobby joggers. 
We welcome students who want to 

train for varsity tryouts, students 
who want to get a run in once or 
twice a week to stay in shape and 
everyone in between. While there 
is occasional tension between the 
opposite sides of this spectrum 
— how couldn’t there be? — each 
individual has quirks that make 
up the fabric of our club. Everyone 
has their unique place in our com-
munity. Our strength lies in our 
familiarity with each other and 
RAM is an essential building block 
of that familiarity.

RAM was where I learned to 

unconditionally 
appreciate 
the 

imperfections of MRun. While we 
all have different goals in our train-
ing, and all want something differ-
ent from the club, we come together 
for the entirety of RAM to work 
toward one goal: to safely traverse 
the state of Michigan as a team.

Throughout RAM, each partici-

pant goes through differing levels 
of intense affection and distaste for 
each other. Though we are tired, 
both mentally and physically, and 
by 3 a.m. mostly just asleep, the fact 
that we manage to complete RAM 
is not only a testament to our indi-
vidual endurance, but the power of 
shared resolve among what MRun 
truly is: a family.

Lacking ‘Characters’ 

By SHIR AVINADAV

Daily Arts Writer

“The Characters” is exactly 

what it sounds like: a seemingly 
never-ending string of wholly 
inconceiv-
able characters 
brought to life 
under outland-
ish 
circum-

stances. 
The 

new 
sketch 

series highlights 
the talent and 
edge of eight 
up-and-coming 
comedians 
by 

giving them free reign to write and 
perform whatever they want in 30 
minutes. Each comedian acts out 
an array of characters confined to 
an episode, ranging from quirky 
individuals to exaggerated tropes.

In one episode Lauren Lapkus 

(“Orange Is The New Black”) flu-
idly transitions from a pop diva 
searching for love on a “Bachelor”-
esque reality show to an insolent 
teenage boy clashing with his 
mom. Though the premise of the 
reality show frames the episode 
and makes for a humorous parody, 
Lapkus’s personification of the 
washed-out, overly made-up celeb-
rity is quite hollow. Not only is her 
bright orange face (a cross between 
a certain presidential candidate 
and someone from the cast of “Jer-
sey Shore”) distracting, but her 
performance is painful to watch. 
From the nasal giggles to the lines 
screeched out at the show’s con-

testants (all named Ben), I couldn’t 
wait for the episode to be over.

Despite the reliance on heavy 

makeup and the hackneyed per-
formance, Lapkus’s style marks 
the episode as distinctly hers. The 
type of characters enacted are the-
matically dramatized stereotypes 
of their real-life counterparts, and 
her use of detail — even in the bla-
tant advertising spoof suggestive 
of the advertising used on real-
life dating shows like “The Bach-
elor” — lend the episode cohesion 
and style. Otherwise, the series of 
sketches would be a jumbled mess 
of ideas haphazardly brought to 
life.

Lapkus’s episode is one of the 

few containing this feeling of cohe-
sion. With a single mind acting 
as the force behind each episode, 
you would expect there to be an 
inherent coherence. However, the 
opposite is often the case. Many 
of the episodes feel like their cre-
ators tried to do too much with the 
short time they were allotted. John 
Early’s (“Wet Hot American Sum-
mer: First Day of Camp”) episode 
is not only difficult to follow, but 
his tense performance imparts the 
episode with a sense of chaos that 
renders his characters unconvinc-
ing. However, with eight differ-
ent comedians given the the kind 
of freedom they have by Netflix, 
there are bound to be some that 
stand out more than others.

Henry 
Zebrowski 
(“Dirty 

Grandpa”) is one of these, bringing 
a burst of energy following Early’s 
episode in his run in with an igno-

rant passerby at a food cart. After 
reprimanding an oblivious man 
who mistakes him for Jim Gaffigan 
by charging him for a signature, 
then throwing the money in the 
bewildered man’s face, he lectures 
him, saying “Wear better shoes 
before talking to a celebrity.” This 
small piece of arbitrary wisdom is 
emblematic of Zebrowski’s biting 
style.

Moments like these highlight 

the individuality that marks each 
comedian’s writing and acting. 
Zebrowski’s superficial arrogance 
makes his shrewdly delivered lines 
even more hilarious, while Nata-
sha Rothwell’s (Writer, “Saturday 
Night Live”) masterfully diverse 
slate of performances makes her a 
standout in the series.

Though a breath of fresh air 

for Netflix’s comedy category, the 
series begs the question of whether 
a single comedic mind and pres-
ence can sustain an entire episode 
in the sketch format without los-
ing the audience’s interest. In their 
efforts to personify the extreme 
characters they’ve written, the 
show’s comedic cast shed their 
inhibitions and infuse the series 
with panache. And though well-
produced, the show’s sketches lack 
the narrative cohesion desired in 
an eight-part series.

It’s eccentric and it’s fresh, but 

it’s exactly “Saturday Night Live.” 
It’s a bunch of comedians given the 
chance to show what they’re made 
of, and though they’re having fun 
doing it, the audience isn’t guaran-
teed the same feeling. 

COMMUNITY CULTURE PREVIEW
Unique ‘Gutenberg!’

By BAILEY KADIAN

Daily Arts Writer

Two men. One musical. A lot of 

hats. And a lot of laughter.

This weekend, Basement Arts 

presents: 
“Gutenberg! 
The 
Musi-

cal!”

Written by 

Scott Brown 
and Anthony 
King, “Guten-
berg! 
The 

Musical!” 
first appeared 
as a 45 min-
utes one-act 
production, at the Upright Citi-
zens Brigade Theatre in New York. 
Following that, it appeared in the 
New York Musical Theatre Festi-
val in 2005 and 2006.

“Gutenberg!” tells the story of 

two playwrights, Bud and Doug, 
who perform a backer’s audition 
for their newest work — a musi-
cal about Johannes Gutenberg, 
the inventor of the printing press. 
Bud and Doug perform every 
part in the show and sing every 
song, using hats to indicate who 
is switching from one role to the 
next.

Their collective research into 

Gutenberg’s life is less than reli-
able, which makes the play within 
a play just as absurd as Bud and 
Doug’s characters outside of their 
play. The play serves as a parody 
of what you’d find in a “typical” 
musical — a big opening and clos-
ing number, an excess of drama, 
energy, dancing and of course, a 
song about almost anything imag-

inable.

The show is structured around 

Bud and Doug’s commentary, or 
“annotation” sections, with tran-
sitions back into the play they 
are performing. The audience 
and their laughter adds a differ-
ent rhythm to the script, which is 
already packed with humor.

“It’s a technically sparse show, 

there are barely any lights, there is 
no set, just two tables of hats with 
different character names writ-
ten on them and a piano,” Music, 
Theatre & Dance senior Graham 
Techler said, in an interview 
with the Michigan Daily. “It’s one 
of those shows that is theoreti-
cally not complicated, but is actu-
ally very complicated, as we have 
learned. But in a fun way, it’s a fun 
challenge.”

The members of this produc-

tion have been creating visions of 
the show for a while, and when the 
proposal was accepted, they were 
able to start putting ideas into frui-
tion.

“We started piecing togeth-

er this weird production team, 
where Barry and I are acting in 
it, I’m co-directing it with Rob-
ert O’Brian, and Anna is assistant 
directing it, and is here all the time 
doing blocking and comedy stuff,” 
Techler said.

Techler and Music, Theatre & 

Dance Barry Riggins, the Music 
Director, were familiar with the 
work, as they had heard from 
people that it was a piece that they 
should look into. Anna Garcia, the 
assistant director, came across 
“Gutenberg!” in a less convention-
al manner.

“Graham and I were on a road 

trip, and we were driving through 
graveyards in Virginia and to dis-
tract ourselves, Graham put on 
‘Gutenberg,’ ” Garcia said. “I loved 
it so much. Once the proposal was 
accepted, I asked if I could come in 
and help.”

Garcia is also an improviser and 

uses her experience to add come-
dic elements to the scenes, as well 
as adjust blocking. 

Riggins has worked as a music 

director before, he said, but never 
while also acting in the musical he 
is also directing.

“This has been a very unique 

process, in that I’m on both sides of 
the table,” Riggins said. “My first 
love is performing and getting to 
do both has been very fun. This 
show is really just an absolute blast. 
It is a show that in satirizing musi-
cals, it clearly comes from a place of 
deep love for them — as both Gra-
ham and I have.”

Rather than a director staging a 

scene for actors, Techler and Rig-
gins do both simultaneously.

“It’s five or six people all collab-

orating on what is happening at the 
same time. It just works,” Techler 
said. “Things that would normally 
not be so good, if you were stag-
ing yourself in a musical, somehow 
become just right for this show.”

Basement Arts offers the per-

fect platform for this sort of pro-
duction, Riggins added.

“ ‘Gutenberg’ is a perfect exam-

ple of a Basement show because it 
is completely a passion project. It 
could never be done in a normal 
University setting,” he said. “The 
SMTD community, and I think 
everyone, will appreciate the type 
of things it is lampooning.”

TV REVIEW

By AMELIA ZAK

Daily Arts Writer

I have been writing about music 

for publications for over a year 
now, and here’s what I’ve learned: I 
shouldn’t call myself a music critic. 
It isn’t appropriate.

Why? I do not have the knowl-

edge to provide a reader with a 
full-bodied conclusion as to how 
they should receive a piece of musi-
cal art. I’m not being self-deprecat-
ing; I’m being honest.

Critiquing music, in an accu-

rate and educated fashion, is an 
art that started to die with the 
rise of the digital age. The inun-
dation of artists and their respec-
tive musical projects filled digital 
page after digital page on Spotify, 
SoundCloud, BandCamp and the 
like. And, like with so many other 
things, this started to kill the 
music critics because now, for bet-
ter or worse, the world’s ears are 
constantly occupied.

So with so many comparisons to 

make and so many trends to follow, 
everyone with a keyboard became 
a critic. Niche blogs grew from all 
the digital holes in the wall. The 
power of so many voices eventual-
ly drowned out the power of a few 
truly knowledgable ones.

There are those music critics 

who think they are on top of the 
allegorical ‘all.’ To them, I say: 
stop kidding yourself. There are 
those constantly trolling the music 
sites, listening and re-listening to 
albums and artists of similar or 
non-similar genres to find some 
new trend. To them, I say: stop try-
ing so hard.

I can critique these individu-

als because I am one of them. I’m 
trying to stay on top of it all, to no 
great avail. And I’m trying to find 
something out of nothing, to no 
great success. I wish I would stop, 
and I think the great Alex G would, 
too.

Alex Giannascoli grew up in 

Havertown, Pennsylvania. In high 
school, he studied the stylings of 
Radiohead and Modest Mouse, 
stole the CDs of his siblings and 
had a couple high school bands. 
He followed a route similar to so 
many up-and-coming artists — he 
followed what he felt. He treated 
the music as something precious, 
almost holy.

“To me, I always considered 

music pretty sacred,” Alex said in 
a phone interview with The Michi-
gan Daily. “I love it to the max. So 
it makes me feel pretty strongly 
when people focus on the shit that 
doesn’t matter.”

Alex G is one of the 21st century 

artists whose music grew into the 
digital age. His incredible guitar-
based instrumentations and ang-
sty, but preciously poetic, lyrics 
made it past the modern barri-
ers of quantity over quality. In an 
arena of so many artists and their 
respective aspirational projects, 
Alex G rose up ever so slowly into 
the spheres of popular music dis-
cussion. He wasn’t one of the first, 
but rather one of the few, to rise to 
fame through the random, indeci-
pherable avenues of the Internet. 
There is so much to be gained in 
that ascent, and so much to be lost.

“The positives are pretty obvi-

ous: I gained this following with-
out any promotion on my part,” 
Alex explained. “The downside 
is uh, I don’t know. I don’t like all 
of the coverage of the music. It 
sucks because that’s what helped 
me so much — all these different 
outlets covering my music, but 
now it seems like it is cheapening 
the music in some way. When they 
have so much shit going on, and 
when there are all these publica-
tions writing all these little bits — 
there is all this saturation. There 
isn’t a lot of mystery anymore, 
either. So much of the appeal for 
me is when I find an artist and the 
only thing I knew was their story, 
with what they were saying in 
their lyrics.”

The art of defeating the bar-

riers of the digital age has been 
mastered by Mr. Alex G, though 
he would never accept that praise. 
Alex knows the fight for authentic-
ity, and the fight to stay as true to 
oneself as possible. Because he’s 
still unsure, too, if all this coverage 
is a good thing.

“Maybe it’s a good thing, maybe 

it will make artists more account-
able,” he said. “I don’t know, I 
think we are starting to lose a lot.”

And he’s right. There is no way 

of saying just yet, but there are 
grounds to wonder: what is going 
to be lost in the digital explosion? 
When everything is accessible, 
and when everyone has an opin-
ion, are we gaining everything? 
We have to be losing something, 
right?

Here’s the only way to combat 

it: focus on the music.

Alex G’s early work was record-

ed in his college dorm room. With 
a basic understanding of music 
production via one’s computer, 
Alex nursed a couple tracks to 
indie rock perfection within the 
four walls of his room at Temple 
University. And then he put them 
on BandCamp. And that honest, 

self-satisfying process continued 
as Alex rose to slow, intangible 
Internet fame.

Those angsty swinging guitar 

sounds and unapologetically sto-
ryline lyrics about frustrated emo-
tion, lost people and indescribable 
anxieties hit the web and played 
into the ears of those who still held 
a candle for the dying indie rock 
music world.

“I guess it’s half and half, most of 

the time it stems from a real expe-
rience or something that I really 
have the urge to write about,” 
Alex said. “But I will morph a lot 
of them so that they aren’t direct 
attacks on someone that I know. It 
usually does come from something 
real. I do want to write something 
well, and if it isn’t real I don’t think 
that I can write it as well.”

So Alex dropped out of col-

lege and became one of the indie 
world’s full-time saviors. Alex 
and his band released their most 
recent album, Beach Music, in 
October of last year. They’ve been 
touring the album ever since. And 
they aren’t worried about going 
anywhere too fast, and they aren’t 
too worried about pleasing anyone 
but themselves.

“Yeah, I mean we are trying 

to incorporate some new stuff — 
we’ve got a keyboard now that 
the guitar player is fooling around 
with,” Alex confessed. “I don’t 
know, it’s going to be hard to 
make any drastic changes. Some 
people might say: oh yeah it’s all 
guitar music, but to me it sounds 
completely different. It’s different 
to me. But to some, it could be all 
the same. I guess it’s all the same, 
either mostly guitar-based or pia-
no-based.”

So stop overthinking it, every-

body. Stop obsessively analyzing 
and just sit back and enjoy. Alex 
and his band want you to know 
that you don’t need to let the over-
whelming nature of the Internet 
kill your joy. They’re pouring their 
hearts, personas and experiences 
into something that you can love 
or hate. They can give you some-
thing to hold a candle to, or they 
can give you something to scoff at 
and ignore. They don’t care what 
you think, but you’ll probably post 
about it on some blogger site any-
way. You will paste your thoughts 
onto something, next to three mil-
lion other unnoticed, unimportant 
and unvalidated opinions. Just like 
this one.

Ways looks to make leap

By KELLY HALL 

Daily Sports Editor

Michigan 
football’s 
passing 

game coordinator, Jedd Fisch, 
needs another receiver who can 
make 40 to 50 catches next year.

He’s already expecting fifth-

year senior wide receivers Jehu 
Chesson and Amara Darboh to 
be closer to 75 catches apiece this 
season, but a third consistent 
threat would make the Wolverines 
that much more dangerous. And 
after seeing Chesson rack up a 
team-leading 764 yards and nine 
touchdowns this past fall, junior 
receiver Moe Ways is hoping he 
can have a similar breakout season 
in 2016 and become that third 
receiver. 

In 2015, Ways appeared in 11 

games, making just three catches 
for 40 yards. He’s going to need to 
make a leap in order to get to that 
number of completions, but he 
doesn’t think it’s out of the realm of 
possibility after seeing Chesson’s 
season.

“Honestly, for Jehu, it just all 

clicked,” Ways said. “After the 
Utah game, everything clicked for 
him. He just played with so much 
confidence. He knew he was the 
go-to guy, him and Amara, and he 
knew that when the game was on 
the line, like the Indiana game and 
the Minnesota game, it’s time to 
make plays.”

Now, in his third season, Ways 

feels as if everything he has 
worked on is starting to fall into 
place. He goes to Darboh and 
Chesson for advice, getting in 
extra practice with them in the 
meantime, because they’ve been in 
his shoes before.

After an offseason of practice 

and advice, he feels better prepared 
to take on a larger role.

“(This 
spring 
feels) 
very 

different,” Ways said. “I know the 
offense a lot better. I’ve gotten 
better working on my weaknesses 
in 
the 
offseason. 
I’m 
more 

confident, playing confident. I 
know what I’m doing.”

For Ways, the answer to getting 

those extra catches is simple: He 
needs to get to the right place and 
catch the ball without dropping it.

In order to ensure he can 

capitalize on the opportunity 
when the ball comes to him, Ways 
put in a lot of handgrip and forearm 
work. Though he doesn’t think 
dropping the ball was a weakness 
of his, he wanted to get better, and 
according to Fisch, he did just that.

“I’m not sure I can remember a 

drop so far in spring, ” Fisch said of 
Ways. “I think Moe Ways leads us 
with the least amount of drops, so 
(the wide receivers) have all come 
in and they’ve all done a nice job 
coming back and kind of letting us 
pick up where we left off.”

Though 
the 
quarterbacks 

are still receiving even reps, the 
constant rotation hasn’t been a 
difficult adjustment for Ways or 
the other receivers. Ways admitted 
that sometimes he can’t even tell 
who’s playing quarterback when 
they quickly switch out — except 

for when left-handed redshirt 
junior 
Shane 
Morris 
throws 

the ball, because it spins in the 
opposite direction.

Freshman quarterback Brandon 

Peters, who graduated early from 
high school and enrolled this 
semester, has stood out to Ways, 
who conceded that he doesn’t look 
like a freshman at all.

“(Peters’) arm strength is very 

good, his accuracy is very good, 
his knowledge of the game is 
very good,” Ways said. “His age is 
young, but the way he plays is not 
young at all.”

Now that Ways is one of the 

older players on the field, he has a 
better grasp of the learning curve 
of college football. 

“It just comes with time,” 

Ways said. “Like I said, first year, 
you learn the offense and kind of 
struggle a little bit, by the second 
year you have a better grasp of it. 
As you get older, your football IQ 
grows and your body changes and 
you start making more plays.”

ALLISON FARRAND/Daily

Moe Ways is hoping to mirror Jehu Chesson’s breakout campaign last season.

‘Shebabs’ shines 
light on refugees

Emotional honesty 
drives film set in 

Syrian camp

By LAUREN WOOD

Daily Arts Writer

Chronicling 
the 
day-to-day 

worries, laughter, struggles and 
friendship 
between a close 
group of friends 
living in the Syr-
ian Palestinian 
refugee 
camp 

Yarmouk, “The 
Shebabs of Yar-
mouk” provides 
a candid look 
into the life of a 
refugee. 
Com-

pleted in 2011, 
the film documents the camp as it 
was before the current rise in con-
flict in Syria, focusing not on the 
factual reasons behind the camp’s 
existence or how external conflicts 
affect it, but on how these con-
ditions emotionally touch those 
growing up within the camp’s 
walls. To these young people, Yar-
mouk is both their beloved home 
and a symbol of their repression, 
something to be escaped from but 
also missed deeply, with these 
conflicting reactions reaching into 
every corner of their daily lives.

The film is told in a mixture of 

straightforward conversation and 
poetic cataloguing of the camp. 
In many instances, the camera is 
shaky, the audio distant and the 
lighting harsh. The friends, all part 
of a group they dubbed “Les She-
babs” as teenagers, sit around on 
cushions and mattresses, smoking 
and discussing their plans for get-
ting passports to leave for Europe-
an countries, current love affairs 
or music they are interested in. It is 
a strange mix of scripted dialogue 
and shaky cinematography — both 
things that would normally point 
toward a film’s failure. But here, in 
Yarmouk, this combination pulls 
its audience in without any false 
pretense. We are given a glimpse 
into the filmmaking process of 
these young people attempting to 
document their liminal lives, and 
the final product succeeds for it.

This amateur honesty that roots 

the friends’ lives in reality is aug-
mented through the film’s focus 
on dialogue as opposed to action. 
Rarely do we witness any active 
moments of the group’s lives; while 
they search for ways out of the 
country, fall in love, attend work 
and school, or complete their com-
pulsory military service, the cam-
era is markedly absent. Only later, 
while reconvening at the end of 
their days do we learn about what 
they have accomplished, and then, 
only through words instead of 
visuals. The direct focus on story-
telling pulls the viewer in as one of 

the group, being told frankly what 
the characters are feeling instead 
of experiencing it alongside them. 
There is no pretense that we could 
understand what they are going 
through or their emotions sur-
rounding the place they know as 
home. We are invited to learn from 
them about their lives, but not to 
live with them in communion.

Interspersed within this upfront 

structure of storytelling are doz-
ens of shots of the camp as seen 
from the rooftops, windows and 
homes of the inhabitants. We never 
see the city from its streets, and 
again are asked to only observe, 
not to live this reality. But, it is in 
these moments that we are able to 
experience most closely the emo-
tions fueling the Shebab’s desire to 
both leave this place behind and to 
treasure their home in the camp. 
The buildings are crumbling, 
rusted satellite dishes spring up 
from every rooftop, tattered sheets 
hang across the open windows. 
But in the lights of dawn and twi-
light, the landscape is transformed 
into one of melancholy beauty. By 
night, thousands of lights twinkle 
through the city of Damascus on 
the horizon. By morning, moun-
tains are seen encroaching on the 
vast sky. We get the same shot of 
the city’s rooftops in every pos-
sible time of day, and through this 
we come to understand how this 
small, tired city can make up an 
entire world for its inhabitants.

FILM REVIEW

Harvard prof. to talk 
U.S. eviction process

By ERIKA SCHEVEK

For the Daily

The couch where the fam-

ily sat and watched movies. The 
dresser where many clothes 
were once fold-
ed, 
and 
the 

kitchen 
table 

where 
laughs 

and memories 
were 
shared. 

They are now 
a mound on the 
sidewalk, like a 
pile of logs sit-
ting in a fire-
place.

This is a realistic slice of the 

eviction process; it’s more than 
just having furniture tossed out 
on the street.

“Rent eats first,” said a Har-

vard University associate profes-
sor of social sciences, Matthew 
Desmond in a phone interview 
when describing his upcoming 
and raw book “Evicted.” Des-
mond will be reading sections 
of his recently published book 
Wednesday at Literati.

The book follows eight unique 

families: 
two 
single 
moth-

ers (Arleen, Vanetta) an 18 
year-old (Crystal), a disabled, 
single father (Lamar), a small 
family with a newborn (Doreen), 
a drug-addicted nurse (Scott), a 

grandmother (Lorraine) and a 
couple (Pam and Ned). Desmond 
discovers their struggle of fac-
ing eviction in the impoverished 
areas of Milwaukee. However, 
he dives into more than just the 
perspective of the families: he 
also peers into the viewpoints 
of the landlords, who make the 
ultimate decision whether or 
not an eviction occurs. Their 
behavior ranges from empa-
thetic to utterly ruthless. These 
juxtaposed vantage points come 
across as shocking and harsh to 
the reader.

Desmond said a desire to learn 

more about the issue was his 
main inspiration for the book. 
“America is a mess,” Desmond 
answered. “I wanted to under-
stand it more, so I felt that evic-
tion was a good frame to study. It 
allowed me to get new insights.”

“Evicted” also has an authen-

tic and rigid feel to it 
 — Desmond 

himself lived beside these fami-
lies and unraveled the cutthroat 
truth about not only poverty, but 
eviction specifically.

“The hardest part was seeing 

this level of suffering in our city,” 
he said. “[Eviction] is not just a 
condition of poverty. It’s a cause 
of it. It’s making things worse.” 
Poverty seems to go untouched, 
meanwhile eviction seems to go 
completely unnoticed.

The 
New 
York 
Times 

said it was “an exhaustively 
researched, vividly realized and 
above all, unignorable book — 
after “Evicted,” it will no lon-
ger be possible to have a serious 
discussion about poverty with-
out having a serious discussion 
about housing.”

Desmond explained that most 

of these families were choosing 
whether to stock the fridge or 
pay the rent. It’s an issue that 
hasn’t been brought to the sur-
face, but clearly needs to be, he 
said.

“There is a massive amount of 

suffering in this rich land, and 
there are hundreds and thou-
sands of questions that remain 
unanswered 
about 
poverty 

and inequality in America,” he 
added.

He finished the interview 

with some advice to wannabe 
writers, journalists, social sci-
entists, or really anybody who 
wants to make a difference: 
“They cannot be afraid to give 
a little bit of their life to it.” In 
other words, it will take extreme 
devotion and an eagerness to 
act in order to amend these 
issues in this country. “Evicted” 
vicariously exposes the reality 
of eviction and the importance 
of handling this hidden problem 
soon, before it is too late.

Shonda Rhimes and 
normalizing diversity

By DANIELLE YACOBSON

Daily Arts Writer

Shonda Rhimes has made it. 

She rules over Thursday nights 
on ABC, gets shout outs during 
Emmy acceptance speeches and 
loves to use the term “vajayjay.” 
As the creator and writer of 

“Grey’s Anatomy” and “Scandal” 
and producer of “How To Get 
Away With Murder,” Rhimes has 
the attention of over 22.5 million 
people each week. Needless to 
say, she’s influential. But in the 
glamorous, exclusive and power-
hungry world of Hollywood, 
influence is easily exploited, and 
just as easily lost. In “Year of Yes,” 
Rhimes’s self-help book detailing 
a transformative year of her life, 
she explores the intense pressure 
she felt as an African-American 
woman in a white man’s industry. 
Her experience has developed 
a unique perspective, which 
she 
showcases 
through 
her 

enthralling 
storytelling. 
She 

has a lesson to teach and a 
point to prove, so when she has 
the simultaneous attention of 
22.5 million people, Rhimes 
unapologetically 
takes 

advantage of it. Her gift of 
storytelling has changed the 
landscape of modern television 
by depicting what the real world 
looks like on screen, featuring 
diverse casts and plot lines 
that break free from overused, 
monochromatic clichés.

Rhimes calls herself, and 

others 
who 
have 
exceeded 

societal expectations set by 
their minority label, a F.O.D. 
– a First. Only. Different. The 
title comes with the weighty 
responsibility of representing an 
entire population, with the risk 
of projecting her failure onto 
others. “You can’t be raised black 
in America and not know,” she 
writes, describing the incredibly 
high stakes that accompanied 
her F.O.D.-ness when creating 
“Scandal,” the first network 
drama in 37 years to feature a 
Black leading lady. If “Scandal” 
failed, the network would have 
evidence against breaking their 
risk-free structure of a non-Black 
successful female protagonist, 
and arguably invalidate her own 
accomplishments as an African-
American 
showrunner 
with 

her previous hit series, “Grey’s 
Anatomy.” “Scandal” ’s success 
not only spurred discussion 
of 
race 
representation 
on 

television, but also gave Rhimes 
the opportunity to continue her 
mission to normalize what and 
who people see on the screen.

One of the greatest obstacles 

that stands in the way of success 
is lack of opportunity. “How To 
Get Away With Murder” star 
Viola Davis said in her 2015 
Emmy acceptance speech for 

Outstanding Lead Actress in 
a Drama Series, “You cannot 
win an Emmy for roles that are 
simply not there.” Davis, the 
first African-American woman 
in history to win best drama 
actress, demonstrates just how 
significant opportunity is in 
reshaping 
the 
demographic 

of network television. Shonda 
Rhimes has been an instrumental 
force in Hollywood, not only 
by creating deep and complex 
roles for minorities, but by 
redefining 
what 
a 
strong 

woman, of any color, is capable 
of accomplishing. Olivia Pope 
(Kerry 
Washington, 
“Django 

Unchained”) 
and 
Annalise 

Keating (Davis), her two leading 
ladies of color, prove that a Black 
actress should not be restricted 
to the role of a sassy sidekick 
when, instead, they can run 
the White House or kick ass in 
court still raw and reeling from 
a bullet to the gut.

While many shows boast their 

cast’s diversity by featuring 
a 
“token 
gay 
character,” 

Rhimes’s explore the spectrum 
of human sexuality without 
using “gayness” as a marker 
of 
progressiveness. 
Instead, 

all three of her Thank God It’s 
Thursday 
hit 
series 
feature 

regular 
cast 
members 
that 

span a wide range of gender 
and sexual identities, and bring 
pressing issues in the media 
and popular culture to the 
forefront. For example, season 11 
of “Grey’s Anatomy” chronicled 
the coming out and transition 
of 
a 
transgender 
character, 

humanizing 
the 
transgender 

awareness movement that swept 
social media platforms in 2015. 
In an interview with NPR, 
Rhimes spoke to her approach 
towards same-sex love scenes, 
saying 
even 
scenes 
created 

following an identical shot-for-
shot sequence as a heterosexual 
couple’s sex scenes were met 
with a heavy dose of censorship. 
This censorship she started 
was something she had to push 
past to show that, no matter the 
gender of the couples, a double 
standard should not exist.

Through 
the 
art 
of 

storytelling, Rhimes is able to 
separate her fictional people 
from politics, prejudices and 
stereotypes. 
Her 
television 

worlds represent what reality 
actually looks like. Simply put, 
Shonda Rhimes is normalizing 
diversity.

2016 Softball Preview

Managing the burden of expectations

The No. 2 Michigan softball 

team is no stranger to high 
expectations.

With 18 Big Ten conference 

titles, 
11 

Women’s 
College 
World 
Series 

appearances 
and 
a 
2005 

national championship to its 
name, the program has been a 
model of consistent success ever 
since head coach Carol Hutchins 
took over the reins in 1985.

However, this season is a bit 

different. Despite a 60-8 campaign 
in 2015 in which the Wolverines 
captured 
both 
the 
Big 
Ten 

regular-season and tournament 
titles, last year is remembered for 
something else.

Falling to No. 1 Florida in Game 

3 of the Women’s College World 
Series in Oklahoma City remains 
the lasting memory of a season in 
which everything else seemed to 
go right.

With the return of four All-

Americans 
— 
senior 
second 

baseman 
Sierra 
Romero, 

outfielders Kelly Christner and 
Sierra Lawrence and junior right-
handed pitcher Megan Betsa — 
and all but one starter from last 
year’s lineup, the Wolverines 
entered the season ranked No. 2 
and have remained firmly planted 
in that spot through the first 
month of this 2016 season.

The only way for Michigan to 

improve, of course, is by winning 
the national title. However, the 
Wolverines refuse to buy into the 
championship or bust mindset, 
and frankly, they shouldn’t.

“It’s a bust to everyone else,” 

Romero said. “To us, we trust 
our preparation, we trust the way 
that we’ve trained and we don’t 

change anything. We’re starting 
over. Last year doesn’t matter.”

For better or worse, what 

people love about sports is that 
anything can happen. A standout 
freshman can be trapped in a 
sophomore slump. A loaded team 
can be decimated by the injury 
bug. And a group accustomed 
to success can fall victim to 
complacency.

On the other side of the coin, 

an under-the-radar player can 
make a surprise showing. A run-
of-the-mill team can go on a tear. 
And an underdog can overtake a 
seemingly superior opponent.

None of these situations can 

be planned for in the preseason 

rankings, 
or 
even 
midway 

through the year. Yet, any one 
of these circumstances could 
change the course of an entire 
season.

Rankings seem to be awarded 

much significance, which is a bit 
puzzling given what they really 
are — attempts to combine past 
performances 
with 
personal 

predictions 
regarding 
player 

progression and future results.

A valiant but often futile effort.
For example, Michigan was 

ranked No. 8 at the start of the 
2015 
season, 
behind 
several 

SEC teams. But the Wolverines 
marched all the way to the World 
Series, beating many of them in 

the process.

By the same token, any number 

of factors could cause a regression 
from their No. 2 ranking.

No psychic, metric or keyboard 

warrior can predict the outcome 
of a season — not in February, 
March, April, May or June. 

So much is conditional, so 

much up to fate. No matter the 
expectations, nobody knows what 
will happen until it happens. 
Nothing can be taken for granted. 
Nothing is a given, nothing is 
guaranteed.

In truth, rankings are just 

numbers with someone else’s 
opinion attached.

That’s the mentality Michigan 

has adopted this season given 
its high expectations because, to 
Hutchins, the only opinions that 
matter are the ones in her locker 
room. In her mind, rankings are 
meaningless.

“This team has that burden of 

expectation that I frankly don’t 
have,” Hutchins said. “We don’t 
spend one minute on it. Nobody 
knows who was ranked second 
last year in the preseason, but 
clearly they were wrong.”

Though the Wolverines may 

have all the pieces in place to 
make a strong postseason run, in 
reality, the season has just begun. 
There’s no telling how, when or 
where their season will end.

“You don’t just go to the World 

Series, it’s not on our schedule 
card,” Hutchins said. “You have 
to earn it. Making it is a big deal. 
It’s hard to get there. ... How you 
respond to (challenges) is the key 
to success.”

Only Michigan’s play on the 

field in every game will determine 
the Wolverines’ fate this season.

For better or worse, it’s in their 

hands.

Big Ten preview: 
2016 season won’t 
be a two-horse race

By TYLER COADY 

Daily Sports Writer

The 
Michigan 
softball 

dominance over the Big Ten 
is akin to that of the Romans 
over the Mediterranean under 
Augustus: 
It 
is 
long-lasting 

and filled with triumph. For 
30 years, the Wolverines have 
dominated the Big Ten, claiming 
18 conference championships 
and racking up 556 wins.

While No. 2 Michigan (20-2) 

enters this conference season 
as the clear favorite to hoist the 
title in May, a more competitive 
season beckons as a bevy of new 
challengers aims to dethrone 
the Wolverines.

No. 22 Minnesota and No. 

23 Nebraska are the most 
formidable 
contenders 
to 

Michigan, as they both are 
coming off NCAA Tournament 
appearances 
in 
2015 
and 

successful 
non-conference 

results this spring. Ohio State 
and Illinois are off to solid starts 
and both have received votes for 
the top-25 rankings this season.

Michigan 
State, 
Indiana, 

Purdue and Wisconsin also aim 
to make some noise as they all 
enter Big Ten play with winning 
records.

If 2015 was a two-horse 

race between Michigan and 
Minnesota, 2016 promises a 
different story.

The Daily broke down all the 

teams that should factor into the 
Big Ten race.

No. 22 Minnesota (16-7)
Having 
made 
last 
year’s 

NCAA Tournament regionals, 
the Golden Gophers were on 
the cusp of a Women’s College 
World Series berth, only to see it 
ruined by perennial powerhouse 
Arizona. Fast forward a year, 
and Minnesota is once again 
poised to challenge for a Big 
Ten championship and a World 
Series appearance.

In non-conference play, the 

Golden Gophers went up against 
numerous 
top-25 
opponents, 

earning several wins over the 
likes of No. 12 Georgia, No. 13 
Oklahoma and No. 21 Arizona 
State but also falling twice to 
No. 10 Florida State and once to 
No. 8 Washington.

When it comes to personnel, 

Minnesota relies heavily on 
right-hander Sara Groenewegen 
to keep them in games, eat up 
innings and provide a boost at 
the plate. Groenewegen has not 
lost her step in the circle so far 
this season, as she enters Big 
Ten play with an 11-3 record and 
1.80 ERA.

In the batter’s box, outfielder 

Kayla Wenner, infielder Sam 
Macken and infielder Danielle 
Parlich make up an imposing 
trio. They all hit over .300, with 
Wenner hitting a staggering 
.400.

If the Golden Gophers are able 

to find a reliable second pitcher 
to back up Groenewegen and 
take advantage of a conference 
schedule that does not include 
Michigan, expect this team to 
make a run at the Big Ten title. 

No. 23 Nebraska (15-6)
Cornhusker junior infielder 

MJ Knighten is putting up 
numbers that rival those of 
Michigan’s Sierra Romero. The 
California native is second in 
the nation with 12 home runs 
and is hitting an eye-popping 
.435. Her teammates aren’t far 
behind, as Nebraska boasts six 
other hitters who average over 
.300. Senior outfielder Kiki 
Stoves is hitting .403 with 19 
runs scored and senior infielder 
Alicia Armstrong has knocked 
in 20 RBI.

Couple this prolific lineup 

with a pitching rotation that 
consists of junior right-hander 
Cassie McClure (8-2, 2.51 ERA) 
and senior right-hander Emily 
Lockman (5-2, 2.82 ERA), and 
the Cornhuskers seem ready 
to take the next step from last 
year’s conference tournament 
runner-up into the Big Ten elite.

Ohio State (11-6)
The Buckeyes played all over 

the country to start their 2016 
campaign and came away with 
moderate success. A win over 
No. 21 Arizona State is the high 
mark of the Buckeyes’ season to 
date, while losses to No. 9 James 
Madison and No. 23 Nebraska 
keep them out of the top 25.

Ohio State’s strength derives 

from the fearsome top half of 
its lineup. Alex Bayne, with her 
.364 batting average and six 
home runs, leads the way while 
Cammi Prantl is hitting .370 and 
Erika Leonard sits at .339.

For the Buckeyes, a best-case 

scenario puts them in the upper 
echelon of the Big Ten, but a 
serious challenge to Michigan, 
Minnesota, and Nebraska at 
the top is unlikely due to an 
inconsistent pitching staff.

Illinois (13-7)
The Illini surprised many 

last season when they recovered 
from a 12-18 start to go 14-9 in 
the Big Ten and 26-27 overall. 
A weak schedule left Illinois 
with few quality opponents in 
the opening stages of 2016, but 
a win over No. 10 Florida State 
signaled its improvement.

The Illini rely heavily on 

their lineup to score runs, as 
pitcher Jade Vecvanags is prone 
to walks and pitcher Breanna 
Wonderly to home runs.

Luckily for Illinois, Kylie 

Johnson is hitting .389, Allie 
Bauch has knocked in 15 runs, 
and Nicole Evans and Carly 
Thomas have combined for eight 
home runs.

Like Ohio State, the Illini 

are capable of posing a serious 
challenge to the Big Ten elite, 
but a more likely outcome places 
them fighting to be the best of 
the rest.

Michigan State (14-10)
Buoyed by the strong play 

of Lea Foerster (.451 average) 
and Celeste Wood (18 RBI), 
Michigan State seems to have 
erased the memory of last year’s 
disastrous season and looks 
primed to play a major part in 
this Big Ten campaign.

So far, the Spartans lost to 

No. 21 Arizona State and No. 12 
Georgia by slim margins and 
have yet to record a victory over 
a ranked opponent.

Indiana (14-9)
An arduous non-conference 

slate posed problems for the 
Hoosiers, who lost to No. 11 
Texas A&M, No. 3 Auburn 
and No. 15 Kentucky. Despite 
problems 
against 
SEC 

opponents, Indiana played all 
of those teams close and took 
Auburn to extra innings.

Indiana’s strength is in its 

arms, as Tara Trainer and Josie 
Wood make up a menacing duo 
and form the backbone of the 
Hoosiers’ hopes for a top-half 
Big Ten finish.

Purdue (13-10)
February and March brought 

the Boilermakers all over the 
country, with an inconsistent 
outcome to show for it. At times, 
Purdue played well, with a 
win over then-No. 25 Central 
Florida. But on other days, the 
Boilermakers were blown out, 
suffering a 11-1 loss to No. 18 
Arizona.

If Purdue aims to better its 

11th-place finish of last season, 
the continued hot hitting of 
Kristen Hoppman and Katie 
Harrison 
is 
of 
the 
utmost 

importance.

Wisconsin (12-11)
Heading into Big Ten play 

last season, Wisconsin held a 
16-14 record. But conference 
matchups proved unfruitful for 
the Badgers, who stumbled to a 
5-17 Big Ten record.

A similar start to this season 

gives the Badgers hope that 
things will be different, and 
with Kelsey Jenkins and Chloe 
Miller having combined for 
eight home runs and 42 RBI to 
date, Wisconsin’s hopes hinge 
on continued production from 
those two.

Michigan will rely on veteran lineup

By AVI SHOLKOFF 

Daily Sports Writer

Veterans anchor the No. 2 

Michigan softball team’s lineup 
from top to bottom. Eight of the 
nine players who regularly start 
for Carol Hutchins’ Michigan 
team also had prominent roles for 
last year’s Women’s College World 
Series squad.

These 
veterans 
will 
lead 

the 
Wolverines 
into 
their 

first homestand and into the 
beginnings of the first part of 
their Big Ten schedule.

The 
Daily 
looks 
at 
how 

Michigan stacks up position by 
position.

Pitchers:
Fifth-year senior right-hander 

Sara Driesenga and junior right-
hander Megan Betsa have stepped 
up to fill the void of two-time 
All-American 
Haylie 
Wagner, 

who graduated last season. Betsa, 
while erratic at times — she has 
walked 38 batters — has thrown 
a whopping 87 strikeouts in 55 
innings, good for 11.1 strikeouts 
per seven innings, the third 
highest in the nation.

After losing last season to 

injury, 
Driesenga 
leads 
the 

Wolverines in innings pitched 
this year and also has compiled 
a 10-0 record. Sophomore Tera 
Blanco gives the Wolverines a 
much-needed third starter and 
after a rough first start against 
Florida, she recovered to throw 
two complete games and now 
boasts a 2.33 ERA. Hutchins also 
may choose to utilize freshman 
right-hander Leah Crockett as 
both a starter and reliever as well. 
Her only appearance came in one 
inning against Virginia Tech.

Catcher:
Michigan starts freshman Alex 

Sobczak behind the plate, and she 
has performed well at bat thus 
far, hitting two home runs and 
driving in 13 runs, while striking 
out just four times, the second-
fewest on the team. She will look 
to improve in the field, however, 
as she has six passed balls and two 
errors through her 19 games as 
catcher. She has caught only one 
of 16 runners attempting to steal, 
an area she’ll need to focus on 
going forward.

Freshman Katie Alexander and 

sophomore utility player Aidan 
Falk will also see some time 
catching for the pitching staff. 
Falk has homered three times to 
begin the year and has added 14 
RBI. She will look to cut down on 
her strikeouts, though, as she has 
11, the second-most on the team.

First base:
Blanco starts at first base, as 

she did last year, in addition to her 
role in the circle. She has gone on a 
tear this season for the Wolverines, 
hitting .426 with 24 RBI, second-
best on the team in both categories. 
She slugs a fantastic .607 and has 
remained errorless in the field. 
Falk and freshman Faith Canfield 
have also received some playing 
time at the position.

Second base:
For the past three years, the 

Wolverines’ 
infield 
has 
been 

anchored by Sierra Romero, and 
this season is no exception. After 
spending her first two years 
at shortstop, Romero began a 
successful transition to second 
base last year and commands 
the position again. Romero is 
currently in the midst of a 14-game 
hitting streak and leads Michigan 
in every triple crown category. 

Additionally, she leads the team 
in runs, slugging percentage and 
total bases.

Shortstop:
For her third straight year, 

junior Abby Ramirez will look to 
continue to start double plays in 
the infield. Thus far, she leads the 
Wolverines with five as well as 
37 putouts. Offensively, Ramirez 
ranks third on the team in batting 
average with a solid .413 and has 
adjusted well to her new spot in 
the lineup as the number two 
hitter.

Third base:
Despite 
junior 
Lindsay 

Montemarano’s hitting struggles 
— her batting average is .153 — 
she still has a substantial hold on 
the third-base position. Early-
season 
slumps 
have 
become 

commonplace 
for 
the 
junior, 

but her defense has remained 
consistent with a .944 fielding 
percentage.

Canfield has also garnered 

time at the hot corner this 
year, and if she improves her 
hitting, she could see even more 
chances. 
Sophomore 
Amanda 

Vargas continues to impress at 
the plate, hitting two pinch-hit 
home runs, and she may see more 

opportunities in the field.

Outfield:
Michigan is led by three top 

veteran 
outfielders, 
including 

two 
All-Americans 
in 
junior 

Kelly 
Christner 
and 
senior 

Sierra Lawrence. Rounding out 
the outfield is senior Kelsey 
Susalla, who also had a breakout 
performance last season.

Along with Romero, Lawrence 

is the only other player to have 
started all four years. Lawrence 
had an on-base percentage of .625 
and stole two bases last weekend, 
in a time when many Wolverines 
struggled 
at 
the 
plate. 
She 

continues to thrive in the leadoff 
spot, leading the team in stolen 
bases — stealing nine in nine 
attempts — and ranks fourth on 
the team in batting average.

Susalla has maintained her 

previous 
season’s 
offensive 

prowess, hitting five home runs, 
good for second-best on the team. 
Christner, while still hitting a 
solid .324, has cooled off a bit 
from her superb All-American 
performance last year. She hopes 
her movement in the batting 
order from the third to the sixth 
spot will continue to improve her 
hitting.

Sophomore infielder Terra Blanco will see time both in the circle and at first base during the 2016 season.


Michigan great’s 
legacy will carry 
far beyond her 

illustrious career

By ORION SANG 

Daily Sports Writer

Sierra Romero still remembers 

the first time she saw Michigan 
coach Carol Hutchins get ejected.

Early during her recruitment 

process, Romero, a high-schooler 
at the time, was watching the 
Wolverines in action during one of 
their early-season tournaments in 
California.

Michigan, Romero recalled, was 

struggling and in need of a spark.

And Hutchins provided it, 

arguing a call with an umpire and 
subsequently getting tossed.

“I was so pumped when I saw her 

get kicked out,” Romero recalled. 
“I think she was purposely trying 
to do that because she wanted the 
team to get a little fire in them. 
Right after she got kicked out of 
the game, they scored a ton of runs 
and ended up winning.”

Romero wasn’t put off by her 

future coach’s fiery display — in 
fact, she admired it.

“I want a coach that’s going to 

fight for me,” she said.

* * *

Fast forward to a Wednesday 

afternoon 
last 
month, 
and 

sophomore catcher Aidan Falk 
is sitting in the softball team’s 
administrative building talking 
about Romero.

The 
No. 
2 
Michigan 

softball team has just finished 
conditioning, and Falk is still 
wearing her uniform.

Asked 
about 
her 
first 

impressions 
of 
Romero, 
Falk 

grins and laughs before giving her 
answer — an answer that suggests 
Romero and Hutchins possess the 
same type of on-the-field presence.

“I was intimidated — hands-

down intimidated,” Falk recalls. 
“She has a very fierce look on 
her face when she plays, and I 
was like, ‘Oh, this girl is going to 
be terrifying.’ ”

Just before Falk finishes, the 

door opens, and Romero herself 
walks in. She’s followed by a 
procession of several teammates, 
who file in and sit down next 
to Falk. Romero, though, heads 
to the side, out of view. As Falk 
talks about Romero, about her 
leadership, batting advice and the 
impromptu dance sessions the two 
occasionally hold during batting 
practice, the senior shortstop is 
within earshot.

When Falk finishes talking, the 

attention turns to Romero.

At first glance, it’s not clear 

what had Falk so intimidated. 
Romero is relatively small in 
stature, standing at 5-foot-5, and 
her facial expression is neutral.

She is asked about her mindset 

going into the fourth at-bat of a 
recent game against Florida State, 
after she had struck out three 
consecutive times, and the room 
falls silent. Intentional or not, 
the intimidation Falk recalled is 
apparent now. The calm vibe of 
the room is gone, and Romero now 

stares straight ahead.

“Swing the bat.”
The room remains silent for a 

couple seconds. Her teammates 
glance at her, and then break out 
into laughter.

Sierra Romero is here, and 

you’ve just been introduced.

* * *

It was apparent early on to 

Michael and Melissa Romero that 
their eldest daughter was mature 
for her age. Michael remembers 
being able to take Sierra as a baby 
to restaurants without worrying 
about her throwing a tantrum. He 
barely remembers her ever crying 
at all.

“She, 
out 
of 
all 
of 
my 

children, was probably the least 
maintenance,” Michael said. “She 
just did her own thing. We got 
lucky with her.”

During one of her dad’s baseball 

games, which she often attended 
growing up, Sierra was in the 
bleachers with her mom when her 
dad blasted a home run so far it 
landed on the freeway.

“I remember looking at my 

mom (and) freaking out,” Romero 
said. “I didn’t know a ball could go 
so far. (After that), I would always 
fall asleep watching baseball on 
(my dad’s) back in the living room, 
so he put me in softball because he 
saw how much I liked it.”

Though her dad’s baseball-

playing days may have influenced 
Sierra to pick up softball, he 
believes her early skill developed 
from her love of the game — she 
simply wanted to be good so badly.

“I was always at softball 

games,” Romero said. “(I was) 
always practicing and always 
wanted to play on the best travel 
ball team, so I was constantly on 
the go every weekend. Traveling 
up to Anaheim, Orange County, 
whether it was for training or 
practice, but it was pretty much 
sports all the time.”

With that conviction, it wasn’t 

long before Romero and her parents 
started fielding requests from 
travel ball coaches who wanted 
Sierra to play on their teams.

At just 8 years old, Romero 

embraced the tough competition, 
long 
drives 
and 
year-round 

schedule. She knew playing travel 
ball could eventually land her a 
college scholarship, and that was 
her next goal.

Despite an admitted desire 

to coach her, Michael stuck to 
providing 
occasional 
off-field 

advice. He let his daughter learn 
from the tutelage of her coaches 
and peers as she gradually became 
a highly touted prospect.

Then, when she was getting 

ready to enter high school, she had 
her big breakthrough.

Romero 
was 
invited 
to 
a 

selective 
recruiting 
camp 
in 

California, and shortly thereafter, 
began 
receiving 
e-mails 
and 

letters from colleges.

Throughout her recruitment, 

there was always one school that 
stood out among the rest, partly 
because of a childhood experience.

When she was 8 years old, 

Romero attended her first college 
fastpitch softball game, a contest 
between San Diego State and 
Michigan.

“I don’t remember a ton about 

it, but I definitely remember 
going and watching the team,” 
Romero said. “My dad 
said that I told him 
that I wanted 
to play for 

Michigan. And at that time I was 
so young that I didn’t even know 
I was going to be recruited, but he 
took me to all the games that we 
could go to with our schedule, and 
I remember going and watching 
Michigan play a lot.”

It’s usually the head coach 

that’s always calling the sought-
after recruit, but Romero was 
so excited about Michigan that 
she couldn’t stop herself from 
constantly phoning Hutchins.

Romero called every week on 

Friday, or every other week on 
Friday. She always wanted to talk 
to Hutchins, and it was always on 
a Friday night.

“ ‘Aren’t you going out and 

hanging out with your friends 
or something?’ ” Romero recalls 
Hutchins saying. “I’d be like, 
‘Maybe later,’ but I’d just want to 
stay at home and relax because I 
was usually tired from softball.”

They talked about everything, 

and the two were really close 
before Romero even enrolled.

She 
and 
her 
family 
then 

scheduled an unofficial visit, with 
one caveat: Sierra insisted that it 
take place during the infamous 
Michigan winter.

“It was during a camp, so I was 

going to get to 
play 
softball 

and experience 
Michigan at its 
worst, because 
I 
had 
never 

really been in 
snow,” Romero 
said. “If I liked 
it, I knew I 
could definitely 
be 
there 
for 

four to five years.”

The question of whether or not 

she could handle the weather was 
answered near the end of their 
visit: While her dad was trying to 
reach their car in a snowstorm, 
Sierra 
was 
busy 
throwing 

snowballs at him.

She loved the visit so much 

that she wanted to make 
a 
verbal 
commitment 

during the trip, but Hutchins 

insisted she wait and think 

it over. So Romero took a 

couple days to let the euphoria 
simmer down, but her feelings for 
Michigan had not subsided.

She told her parents, and 

then called Hutchins to deliver 
the news. The choice itself was 
easy; in fact, the hardest part 

of her commitment process 

was letting other coaches 

know that she had chosen 

Michigan 
and 
would 

be cancelling already-

scheduled visits to their 
schools.

Eight-year-old 

Sierra’s 
dream 
of 

playing 
for 
the 

Wolverines 
was 

coming true.

* * *

Of course, the expectations for 

Romero were sky high.

By the time her high school 

career was over, she had risen to 
a lofty ranking as the No. 3 recruit 
in the nation, according to ESPN.

After predominantly playing 

second base before coming to 
Michigan, Romero learned how 
to play shortstop at the collegiate 
level from her veteran teammates. 
She seized the starting job heading 
into spring practice before her 
freshman year.

With her confidence at a high, 

Sierra’s collegiate career started 
with a bang. In her second game, 
she hit her first home run — a 
grand slam.

It was a sign of things to come.
As a freshman, she started all 

64 games, led the team in each 
major batting statistic, set a 
Michigan single-season homerun 
record, earned Big Ten Player of 
the Year honors and was named a 
second-team All-American.

Her second year would only 

be better, as she increased most 
of her batting statistics, received 
first team All-American honors 
and was once again the Big Ten 
Player of the Year.

Defensively, she cut her errors 

to almost half 
of what they 
were 
as 
a 

freshman.

And 
her 

junior 
season 

— last year — 
saw even fewer 
errors 
and 

an 
improved 

fielding 
percentage, 

while she continued to excel at the 
plate.

The team also had the most 

success of her career, finishing 
as runner-up to Florida after a 
closely contested World Series.

Now in the final stretch of 

her career, Romero is the type 
of mentor to her teammates that 
former players once were for her.

She’s also gone from the 

intimidated to the intimidator.

* * *

Like Falk, freshman infielder 

Faith Canfield remembers being 

scared by the thought of playing 
with someone as good as Romero. 
It turned out that getting to know 
the second baseman — Romero 
switched to second base between 
her sophomore and junior years — 
was easier than 
she thought.

“She’s 
just 

like 
everyone 

else,” Canfield 
said. “She is one 
of the hardest-
working 
(players). 
She 

has come to all 
the 
freshmen 

— she’s there to 
pick us up, and is doing a good job 
teaching us the ropes. She’s just an 
amazing player to play with and 
definitely a huge role model.”

Canfield said the moral support 

provided by Romero is especially 
comforting and shows what type 
of leader she is.

“They threw me in at first (in) 

the last inning of a game, and I 
dropped the ball,” Canfield said. 
“I walked over (to second base) 
and did a frustrated sigh, and 
(Romero) goes, ‘What’s wrong?’ 
I was like, ‘Just should’ve caught 
that.’ She said, ‘We’re all going to 
mess up. Everything’s all right. 
Don’t stress yourself.’ ”

And while Romero clearly has 

a large impact on her younger 
teammates, her fellow captains 
Kelly 
Christner 
and 
Olivia 

Richvalsky are evidence that 
Romero’s 
influence 
spreads 

beyond just the underclassmen.

“You can go up to her if you 

need 
advice, 
softball-wise 
or 

anything else,” Christner said. “So 
I think just having that connection 
with her is good.

“She’s very similar to Hutch. 

They both just have that presence. 
They’re kind of intimidating, but 
once you get to know them, they’re 
completely down to earth, easy to 
talk to, easy to go to for anything, 
very honest people.”

Richvalsky, Romero’s roommate 

and close friend, feels a similar way.

“If you ever need someone to 

have your back, Sierra is who I 
go to,” Richvalsky said. “She’s 
loyal and honest. I admire her 
ability to play through any type 
of struggles. Injuries, mental 
blocks, she prevails. That’s why 
I’ve always looked up to her, even 
being a peer.”

On Feb. 26, the Romero family 

gathered in Palm Springs, Calif., 
to watch Sierra take on her little 
sister, Sydney, and the Oklahoma 
Sooners in the Mary Nutter 
Collegiate Classic.

The siblings, three years apart 

in age, briefly played together in 
recreational ball as youngsters and 
later shared Vista Murrieta High 
School’s infield for one year. But 
facing each other wasn’t difficult.

“Of course, I wanted to win, 

and she wanted to win,” Sierra 
said. “But we were more excited to 
see each other.”

In fact, part of the reason 

Sydney was wearing crimson and 
cream instead of maize and blue 
was because of Sierra’s advice. 
Sierra didn’t pressure Sydney to 
join her in Ann Arbor.

“I know I love Michigan, but that 

doesn’t mean she’s going to,” Sierra 
said. “So I just told her, ‘You have to 
go where you’re going to be happy 
for four years, because I’m only 
going to be (at Michigan) for one.’ ”

Sierra’s 
relationships 
with 

Sydney and her two other siblings 
have always been positive.

Her brother Michael plays 

baseball and idolizes his softball-
playing sisters, especially Sierra. 
He says all the time that he wants 
to play baseball at Michigan 
because she went there.

Michigan 

emerged 
with 
a 
16-9 

victory against 
Oklahoma, 
and when the 
two teams met 
for 
postgame 

handshakes, 
Sierra 
and 

Sydney 
embraced 

before continuing down the line.

As Romero’s career comes to its 

close, Hutchins contemplates what 
her star player’s legacy will be.

Though the coach mentions it 

will be hard to overlook Romero’s 
personal accomplishments, she 
believes how Romero will be 
remembered will depend on how 
she has affected those around her.

“She’s a typical kid who is 

very consumed with her game,” 
Hutchins 
said. 
“She’s 
always 

been a good teammate, but 
learning how to be consumed 
with her teammates’ game, that’s 
something that I think she’s 
learned and really embraced.”

Romero has similar thoughts to 

her coach.

“I think a great player is 

somebody who can bring everyone 
else to their level,” she said. “A 
good player is a good player, and 
they’re going to continue to do 
well, but if you’re able to do well 
and also bring everyone else 
around you to that level and make 
them better, then that just puts 
you toward the top.”

And though she has achieved 

most of her goals throughout 
life, from playing for the nation’s 
most prestigious travel ball team 
to earning a scholarship from 
Michigan, Romero thinks that 
she will never be done improving 
as a leader and influencing those 
around her.

“I don’t think I’m ever going 

to be satisfied with the way that 
I lead,” she said. “There’s always 
something you can learn or do 
better at. I don’t think I’m ever 
going to stop fully learning how to 
be the best I can be.”

She will finish as the school’s 

all-time leader in home runs, RBI, 
walks and runs, and barring an 
extended slump, as its all-time 
leader in batting and slugging 
percentage as well.

But she doesn’t want that to be 

her legacy.

She may even help complete 

the team’s run to a national 
championship, but she doesn’t 
want that to define her either.

Maybe the legacy of Sierra 

Romero won’t show in her first 
game or in her last game, but rather 
in the way her leadership is carried 
on by her teammates in the seasons 
to come. Maybe it will show in the 
influence she has on her siblings 
and in the dreams of many young 
fans who clamor for autographs 
before and after games, all wanting 
to be the next No. 32.

It seems odd that perhaps the 

greatest statistical hitter in team 
history will not be best known for 
her numbers.

But, then again, maybe that’s 

the point.

THE MICHIGAN DAILY | MARCH 16, 2016

re you familiar with the feeling of talking to 
someone you know isn’t really listening? I imag-
ine it draws strong resemblances to speaking to 

a robot: it nods, it provides answers, but it’s incapable of 
really hearing, or caring, about what you have to say. I 
find myself personally frustrated when, in the middle of 
a conversation, the person I’m talking to interrupts with 
a story about him or herself. Sadly, I’ve noticed this gen-
eral tendency in my own behavior. Afterward, I think 
to myself: “Am I talking simply to counter with my own 
experiences, or am I genuinely interested in what this 
person has to share?” 

In a 2014 article written by Harvard Business Prof. 

James Heskett, several professionals suggest the art 
of listening is gradually facing extinction. One scholar 
offers that a generation constantly scrolling through 
its own Twitter and Instagram feed has inevitably lost 
interest in engaging with those outside its realm of inter-
ests and mutual friends. Society now creates virtual net-
works based on whom and what it wants to see — so why 
bother listening to everyone else?

Others experts suggest that humans have struggled 

with the art of listening throughout history. It’s only 
more apparent now because the human population is 
significantly more interactive than it was 30 years ago.

Have you ever wondered why teachers and profes-

sors encourage you to lower your hand when another 
person speaks? The logic is two-fold: first, it’s a sign of 
respect. But there’s also the fact that when your hand is 
raised, you’re no longer listening to what your fellow stu-
dent is saying. Instead, you’re contemplating your own 
response.

Haskett’s article discusses the Harvard Business 

School discussion leadership strategy, in which leaders 
are encouraged not to call on students whose hands have 
been raised for an extended period of time under the 
assumption that they have stopped listening to the pres-
ent conversation and will therefore bring the topic back 
to what was said several minutes ago.

Whether or not the millennial “Self(ie) generation,” is 

less capable of listening than older generations, we can 
all agree that our society has a serious listening deficien-
cy. 

I’m bothered by this not only because being ignored 

and feeling invisible is incredibly frustrating, but also 
because I don’t want to subconsciously isolate myself 
from the valuable stories, experiences and ideas of those 
around me simply because I’m naturally more interested 
in my own. I don’t just want to share my experiences 
with someone I know genuinely cares; I want to be the 
person who genuinely cares.

I’ve recently begun catching myself from zoning out 

of conversations. I now hold back from liberally insert-
ing personal anecdotes wherever they apply. I do this 
because I don’t want to live in the comfortable world I 
subconsciously construct for myself; the one in which 
I choose the people and news I interact with based on 
my own background and interests. When people are 
generous enough to share their personal thoughts and 
ideas with me, I want to be the kind of person who cares 
enough to listen and engage with what they have to say.

I think that one of the positive aspects of 

online class is that you can manage your 

time and have the opportunity to take classes 

that you wouldn’t have the possibility to 

take otherwise. I wasn’t enough motivated 

enough. I’ve realised that it has been due to 

the absence of human contact: going to the 

traditional classes motivate me more. I think 

that the relationship and the confrontation 

with classmates is really important and that

“What have I in common with Jews? I have hardly 

anything in common with myself and should stand very 
quietly in a corner, content that I can breathe.”

-Franz Kafka, 1914, diary

I have noticed that Jewish people at the University of 

Michigan call Jews, collectively, “The Tribe.” It sounds 
kind of to me like one of those secret societies at an Ivy 
League where you have to destroy a Rolex to enter.

This is not the Jewish identity I am used to. I am used 

to one where I’m alone, sometimes lonely and sometimes 
not. But always by myself. It’s ninth-grade gym class, 
the first day of high school, I haven’t made any friends 
yet, and a bunch of boys behind me yell “Jew” at me as I 

walk alone. I’m a reporter on my school newspaper and 
my editor tells me to get to work and “stop playing with 
my dreidels.” Even on Birthright, I’m preparing to say 
the Shabbat prayers and I don’t know the right words or 
rhythm, and someone later tells me I’m not technically 
Jewish because my mom is not.

I’m not part of The Tribe. I don’t know how to get in, 

and I’m not really sure I want to enter.

Throughout high school, when people lobbed Holo-

caust jokes at my expense and told me to get a nose job, 
I dreamed of going to a school where I could have end-
less Jewish friends. We would bond over our unruly 
hair, love of smoked salmon and stingy fathers. A sort of 
millennia-long bonding, springing from our very shared 

DNA, would make us an unbreakable group of brunette 
girls in North Face coats.

It didn’t happen. I’ve felt disillusioned by the Jewish 

community on campus since day one. When the divest-
ment movement started late in my sophomore year, I 
felt unable to agree with people who overwhelmingly 
believed that Jews are a stigmatized minority on cam-
pus. There are three buildings on Hill Street alone dedi-
cated to Jewish students. Jews comprise 18 percent of 
the student population, according to Hillel, not to men-
tion their prosperity nationwide. Yes, anti-Semitism still 
exists. But I can’t connect with people who truly believe 
that Jews face similar barriers as Black, Muslim, Asian 
or other people of color on campus and globally.

I don’t have many Jewish friends. I can only find a 

few with the same values and interests as me. All of my 
friends have hooked up with and dated more Jewish boys 
than I have. I want to go to Hillel and be Jewish, but then 
I go, and I don’t recognize anyone, and they all recognize 
each other. My friends are Indian, Pakistani, Chinese, 
Korean, just plain white or a mix of those things. By and 
large, though, they’re not Jewish. Sometimes I entertain 
them by making fun of Jews, and they’re not sure if they 
can laugh.

I don’t know how this happened. My great-grandfa-

ther was beheaded for fighting against the Russian gov-
ernment’s policy to kill Jews. His son Leonard found his 
body. Leonard immigrated to America in his teens, and 
died in Los Angeles on Yom Kippur, the father of an Ivy 
League college professor and a newspaper editor. A long 
way from Russia.

My grandfather eloped with a girl from China. My 

father married a Catholic girl who is still in denial that 
I’m going to raise my kids to be Jewish.

Then it comes to me, in 2014. I’m walking down Hill 

Street in a crop top meeting my friends to get drunk. It’s 
Friday night. Shabbat. I see a girl about my age and her 
family walking to Chabad. She’s in a long skirt, her hair is 
as dark and unruly as mine. I’m dating a Catholic whose 
parents don’t know I’m Jewish. I barely know the Shab-
bat prayers. I eat bacon. But she’s probably the descen-
dant of Jews chased out of Eastern Europe, like me.

We have the same genes. But I’m on the other side of 

the street.

Every Monday and Wednesday at 1 p.m., room 1230 of the Undergraduate Science 

Building slowly fills with students. Around 1:05, Communication Prof. Paddy Scannell 
walks to the chalkboard at the front of the room and begins to write out his plan of attack. 
As white chalk hits green slate stone, his nearly 50 years of academic teachings present 
themselves to approximately 80 students that are still filing into room.

Usually, the format of the writing reads as an outline, but sometimes diagrams of 

interconnected ideas or key figures commandeer a large portion of the board. When the 
writing stops, the professor takes a step back, looks over his work one final time and begins 
his lecture. Throughout the lecture, he will add points or diagrams that complement what 
is already there.

In a world of hyper connection, PowerPoint presentations and iClickers, Scannell 

consciously selects only two technologies to engage with his students: his voice and the 
piece of chalk in his hand. It is the technology of talk and the technology of chalk brought 
together to educate the masses.

Although it isn’t electrically powered or connected to the Internet, Scannell’s lecture is 

technologically considered. It is technological efficiency in its purest form.

***
The nature of the average college classroom is radically different today than it was even 

five years ago. In almost every classroom on campus, professors have the ability to use a 
projector screen, a desktop computer, document cameras and sometimes even electronic 
whiteboards. Looking back at those professors are often hundreds of glowing Apple logos, 
illuminating the thousands of dollars in laptops brought to class each day by students.

With an ever-expanding wireless network supported by the University of Michigan, 

both professors and students in modern higher education quite often mix class with the 
Internet interactions. Professors might spend some of their lecture showing a YouTube 
video or a Prezi presentation. Meanwhile, students might spend some of the same lecture 
taking notes on a Google Doc while simultaneously filling out an online survey to find out 

which character from “The Walking Dead” they are most like.

Outside the classroom, learning management systems like Canvas and CTools connect 

professors and students in ways that 1950s college students could never imagine. E-mail 
systems complement such learning management platforms and allow for formal and direct 
communication between academic citizens.

Collectively, these in-classroom and online technologies have shifted the conversation 

in higher education from what a professor says to what technologies they use in the 
framework of their teaching.

Barry Fishman, a professor in the School of Information and the School of Education, 

focuses much of his teaching on how technology plays a role in the collegiate classroom. 
Having developed (among many, many other projects) a gamified class format called 
GradeCraft, which mirrors the achievements one might experience in a video game rather 
than traditional grading scales, Fishman knows all about how technology influences 
higher education.

His first experience with technology in education came when one of his undergraduate 

English classes was formatted entirely in hypertext, which is the underlying format for the 
World Wide Web.

Rather than relying on the traditional English book, Fishman’s professor used hypertext 

pages as the backbone of his classroom. In this hypertext network, Fishman’s classmates 
created content that became interconnected in ways that were not possible in a hardcover 
novel.

“It caused me to think about my own learning in a way that surprised me,” Fishman said.
Since that time, Fishman has dedicated his teaching and research to the pursuit of 

implementing technologies into learning environments that enhance the educational 
opportunities for all those involved.

His current venture, the aforementioned GradeCraft, has the ambition “to motivate 

students and allow them to feel in control of their own learning.” Rather than assigning 

CHALK TALK 
AND HYPERTEXT: 
TECHNOLOGY IN 
THE CLASSROOM

BY ELLIOTT RAINS, 
DAILY OPINION COLUMNIST

arbitrary percentages to assignments and 
allowing grade finalization to occur three 
weeks after a final exam, GradeCraft allows 
students to progressively gain points to 
reach different achievement levels.

For example, a student who reaches 7,000 

points out of the 12,000 possible points with 
10 assignments valued at 700 points each 
might earn a “C” grade if they are to not 
advance any further. Reach 10,000 points 
and that student will earn an “A” in the class. 
These scores update progressively and are 
meant to visualize academic progression, 
simultaneously encouraging students to 
take risks without fear of failure and keep 
working for greater game (read: academic) 
achievement. By turning the class structure 
into a real-world video game, Fishman’s 
GradeCraft aims to incentivize learning and 
engage students in a new way.

His work has even taken him to the 

White House, having co-authored the 
Obama administration’s 2010 U.S. National 
Educational Technology Plan.

When compared to the nature of Paddy 

Scannell’s lectures in Room 1230, one 
might assume that Fishman and Scannell 
fundamentally disagree on how to teach. 
After all, Scannell uses a blackboard, chalk 
and his voice to teach his class, which is 
underpinned by a traditional grading scale 
and structure. Fishman bases his entire 
model of instruction around a concept that 
can be played using a controller on a high-
def TV.

If there ever were polarities in the 

classroom, one would be wise to assume 
these professors were north and south. 
However, at the core of each professor’s 
ideology lies the same fundamental goal: 
to help students gain knowledge that is 
actually worth making the effort to learn.

“My philosophy of teaching is that the 

classroom experience should be some kind 
of human interaction between the teacher 
and the class,” said in discussing his class 
format.

The nature of a large lecture hall of 

80-some students necessitates a relationship 
where Scannell lectures and the students 
listen; such sacrifices must be made given 
student-teacher ratios at large universities.

As far as his use of the blackboard and 

limited visible notes, Scannell said, “It’s 
not as if I’m making (my lecture) up from 
moment to moment, but I am talking it into 
existence.”

The technology of talk facilitates this 

interaction and prevails in one of Scannell’s 
lectures. Rather than reading directly off 
a sheet of notes or a slide, Scannell’s vocal 
variance and sentence structure make each 
statement conversational, educated and, 
most importantly, humanistic.

And what goes into those limited notes 

is a conscious choice by the seasoned 
professor.

“I don’t like making (my lecture) too cut 

and dry at this point,” Scannell said.

What he hopes to achieve in his teaching 

is not for students to copy definitions off 
a PowerPoint slide and get the “cut and 
dry” experience, but rather engage in a 

conversation that sparks interest in the 
topic at hand, a sentiment Fishman, in a 
sense echoed.

“Now that most facts can be looked up, 

anything you can answer with Google 
probably isn’t worth teaching,” Fishman 
said. The “cut and dry” information one 
might get off a PowerPoint is inevitably 
something one could also find with Google.

What one cannot find on Google — and 

what might be worth taking the time to 
learn — is the conversation around topics, 
ideas, facts and history.

“The teaching situation, ideally, is an 

interaction between the teacher and the 
students,” Scannell said. It is in such an 
interaction where the technologies of chalk 
and talk facilitate what Google cannot. 
Where a computer sits, waiting for input, 
Scannell engages on his own, guiding the 
conversation in such a way that only an 
expert human in his field could do.

Furthermore, as a resident-expert on 

all types of teaching software, devices and 
inventions, Fishman insisted, “It’s not the 
technology; it’s what you do with it.”

While 
some 
might 
complain 
that 

professors like Scannell should at least use 
PowerPoint, there is nothing inherently 
possessed in a PowerPoint slide that can 
teach a student what is worth knowing. 
Likewise, while Fishman’s gameful model of 
academic progression affords students the 
ability to engage with learning in a unique 
fashion, were it to be implemented in the 
same way a traditional grading scale might, 
the technological ideology of GameCraft 
would not help at all.

Although technologies like Smart Boards, 

iClickers and tablets all generate the type 
of hype that would suggest each device is 
the singular invention that is going to “fix” 
education, Fishman says this is a myth. While 
each of these products, and the GameCraft 
program more conceptually, all allow for 
new experiences, the implementations of 
each idea is what matters.

In contrast, Fishman said, products like 

iClickers don’t bring something novel. “It’s 
a failure of imagination,” he said. “When 
people use clickers for attendance, that’s 
not new; that’s (just) a lot of infrastructure 
for attendance.”

“But 
when 
people 
do 
something 

interesting 
like 
collaborative 
problem 

solving (using clickers), that makes them 
more interesting,” he added.

For professors like Scannell, structuring 

his class to be most interesting and most 
adept at engaging students in order to 
facilitate learning might just consist of 
talking at a chalkboard for an hour and a 
half.

Of course, for all professors, it quite often 

doesn’t matter how interesting or engaging 
they might make their course if the students 
they are attempting to connect with are 
engrossed in a Buzzfeed quiz or the most 
recent Twitter updates. Laptops and laptop-
based notes facilitate more distraction 
than ever before, so maintaining focus and 
engaging with the learning process can 
become more difficult for students.

But nonetheless, all of this is to say 

that, at the aesthetic level, professors like 
Barry Fishman and Paddy Scannell seem 
to be operating in completely different 
universes when it comes to the technology 
when analyzed based on the ideology that 
underpins each professor’s views, we can 
see that technological devices or programs 
haven’t really changed the nature of 
education all that much.

Where Fishman hopes to see change 

directly 
facilitated 
in 
the 
university 

setting is in the overall structure of higher 
education. The nature of degree progression, 
based on distribution requirements, credit 
hours and measuring knowledge by the 
number of classes a person takes might soon 
see the axe if technology advances as it has 
recently.

“One of the exciting potentials in 

electronic teaching tools is they throw off a 
lot of data from the interactions,” Fishman 
said. “And, in theory, it could be used for 
very powerful means to help guide teaching 
or guide learning.”

Rather 
than 
relying 
on 
arbitrary 

measures like the credit hour, such large 
data could generate alternative credentials 
that signify actual knowledge retention and 
application.

Learning programs like ECoach at the 

University, which takes machine learning 
and applies it to artificial intelligence-based 
homework feedback, will hopefully use big 
data to enable in-classroom opportunities 
that educators dream of, as well. Of course, 
if improperly applied, even applications so 
advanced will serve little purpose beyond 
current measures.

Such is the nature of technology in the 

classroom. At the end of the day, the field 
of higher education is made up of human 
beings. And, in the eyes of human beings like 
Paddy Scannell, this human relationship 
will hopefully stick around for quite some 
time.

“So long as there are classrooms and so 

long as students assemble in a learning 
situation with faculty, there’s room for good 
old talk,” he said

***
It’s nearing 2:25 and Scannell is now 

finishing his good old talk for the day. 
As students begin to close their laptops, 
zip their book bags and pull out their 
smartphones, Scannell begins to erase the 
chalk off the green slate stone in front of 
him.

Somewhere across campus, at quite 

possibly the same moment, a group of 
students is packing their bags and checking 
their phones as Fishman is finishing his 
class for the day. As Fishman logs off his 
laptop and unplugs it from the projector, 
his metaphorical chalkboard is wiped clean 
for the day, leaving the screen on which his 
lecture notes existed barren.

At this moment, a professor who engages 

in the technology of talk and a professor 
who engages in the technology of games 
exist in symmetry. At this moment, and in 
many moments in the future, the nature of 
education will not be defined by a screen 
being on or a chalkboard being covered, 
but by the respective thought that each 
professor decided to stop on for the day and 
where they will continue with that thought 
when their class meets again.

Fear and Self-Loathing in Santiago: A Dry Heave in the Sunshine

by Adam DePollo, Daily Arts Writer

M

y journey to West Palm Beach, Fla. began 
with six hours aboard a passenger train rid-
ing out of Orlando. A sizable portion of the 

travel time was spent moving in reverse, much of the 
retrograde locomotion happening around a few miles 
of incredibly dry-looking, cow-dotted farmland out-
side of Jacksonville. When seen through my Amtrak 
car’s slightly yellowed windows, the whole place 
looked as though it could spontaneously combust with 
the slightest provocation. I was also reading Mark Z. 
Danielewski’s metatextual psychological horror novel 
“House of Leaves,” which includes sentences like this:

“My point being, what if my attacks are entirely unre-

lated, attributable in fact to something entirely else, 
perhaps for instance just warning shocks brought on 
by my own crumbling biology, tiny flakes of unknown 
chemical origin already burning holes through the fab-
ric of my mind, dismantling memories, undoing even 
the strongest powers of imagination and reason?”

My point being that all of this had me feeling as 

though I would be disembarking into a sort of semi-
tropical episode of “The Twilight Zone” as soon as the 
train rolled into the West Palm Beach station. I was a 
little nervous, I have to admit, because I wasn’t sure if 
I would be given Rod Serling’s part or William Shat-
ner’s, or if I would be the lady sitting next to William 
Shatner on the plane, or if I might even be playing the 
Sasquatch-on-the-wing for some Floridian Shatner I 
would soon be meeting for the first time.

The train pulled into the station and I dragged 

myself out of my head just long enough to shuffle over 
to the parking lot. I could hear the Manhattan Trans-
fer’s “Twilight Zone” playing out of a car stereo — my 
ride was waiting for me.

I climbed into the back of the bumblebee-colored 

Fiat 500L and was immediately assaulted by a barrage 
of excited snorts and a rather horrific chicken salad-
tinged fart. My grandfather’s French bulldogs Lionel 
and Lulu were sitting in the front seat, wiggling and 
staring back at me expectantly. They would be my 
more or less constant companions for the next 16 and 
a half days, and they were clearly looking forward to 
the idea. My grandfather was sitting in the passenger 
seat and his longtime girlfriend Lara drove the car out 
of the lot.

The bulldogs are siblings. Lionel is all black, was 

born missing his right eye and has a head which 
seems slightly too big for his surprisingly muscular 
25-pound frame. Lulu is fawn-colored, has an appro-
priately sized head for her equally muscular 23-pound 
frame and is the more restrained half of the duo. Lio-
nel seems to have internalized my retired sportscaster 
grandfather’s love of sportsball, spending most of his 
days losing and getting a collection of tennis balls 
caught under various pieces of furniture. Lulu, on the 
other hand, has taken on her adoptive mother’s more 
relaxed demeanor, spending her leisure time lounging 
in sunny patches and occasionally joining her broth-
er in a tug-of-war over fallen coconuts. Both dogs, I 
learned, have terrible gas and no regard whatsoever 
for where or when or into whose unaware face they 
unleash their odors.

Driving from the station to my grandfather’s house 

in the suburbs outside of West Palm Beach, Lulu stood 
in Lara’s lap and stuck her head out of the driver’s side 
window while Lionel sat respectfully in my grand-

father’s lap on the passenger side. They asked how I 
felt about my upcoming study abroad program in San-
tiago, Chile and I described to them a short story I’m 
working on in which Mexican drug lord El Chapo’s 
otherwise pleasant meeting with the American actor 
Sean Penn is ruined by the fact that the sky is made 
out of the same silk fabric as his button-down shirt 
and his glass of Buchanan’s scotch whiskey is laugh-
ing at him. I didn’t want to seem too engaged with the 
world around me; I was planning on spending most 
of the trip interspersing lengthy pool-side naps with 
alternating bouts of frantic fiction-writing and equally 
frantic, thoroughly ruthless self-critique. Ideally, the 
occasions during which I would be expected to inter-
face with reality would be kept to a minimum, leaving 
me free to stew in the self-effacing juices I had brought 
down from Michigan in my carry-on bag.

For a few days, at least, my plan almost worked. Lara 

(a successful New York divorce attorney) flew back 
to Manhattan to do some lawyering. Meanwhile, my 
grandfather was happy to do crosswords in the kitchen 
while I marinated in a thick broth of David Foster Wal-
lace, Jorge Luis Borges, Roberto Bolaño and Saul Bel-
low out on the patio.

The dogs, on the other hand, had no respect for 

creative genius. Lionel took a particularly sadistic 
pleasure in distracting me from distractedly flipping 
through the footnotes at the back of “Infinite Jest” by 
nudging his tennis ball into the pool and barking at 
it until I came over to fish it out for him. Lulu would 

jump into my lap whenever she noticed I had been 
staring at the same page of “Herzog” for fifteen min-
utes, snorting into my face until she was thoroughly 
convinced that my writerly mojo had irretrievably dis-
sipated. Both of them would somehow jam a coconut 
under the fence whenever I had finally managed to get 
into the groove with my doodle-making in the margins 
of a copy of “2666.”

After three days of fishing tennis balls out of the 

pool, I had had enough. There was a heavy rainstorm 
that day and I demanded that my grandfather drive me 
a few miles down the semi-flooded road to a B-grade 
Starbucks, where I sat in a corner hunched over an 
iced latte and wrote this:

The Writer smelled a Metaphor, so he took off his 

fake duckbill and picked up his notebook. He put his 
nose to the ground and crawled around on the patio, 
following the scent along the spaces between the pav-
ing stones. The gurgling of the pool focused his senses, 
and he was certain to check around the corner, just 
in case Jorge Luis Borges had followed him along the 
train tracks out of Orlando. Convinced he was alone, he 
began his search in earnest.

The Pursuit of the Metaphor took him to parts of 

the backyard that it had never occurred to him to visit 
before, like the Underside of the Massive Concrete 
Planter northeast of the Patio Set, or the Roots of the 
Bird of Paradise Tree tearing up the foundation of 
the house just south of the Air Conditioning Unit. He 
passed a little brown bird whose name he didn’t know

My Brother, Joseph

by Katie Penrod, Daily News Editor

T

he moment a baby takes its first steps is such 
a beautiful thing: the stumble, the arms reach-
ing out, mom and dad smiling across the room, 

the “you can do it” and “just one more step.”

I don’t remember my first steps, but I remember 

Joseph’s.

My brother Joseph took his first steps like any 

other child. It was probably as normal as you can 
imagine. It included all the stumbling and hope and 
excitement that first steps normally do.

Little did I know Joseph would only walk for 12 

more years.

When he was five, our world turned upside down. 

He’d been walking for four and a half.

When he was six, I Googled the words “Duchenne 

Muscular Dystrophy” and finally understood the 
gravity of what was happening. I felt hopeless.

When he was seven, the limping and slowness 

were evident when he couldn’t keep up with his 
friends.

Eight, nine and ten: He struggled more and more.
11: He was using his scooter to keep up.
12: He couldn’t stand for more than one minute. He 

held on to the bathroom counter when he brushed 
his teeth.

13: He lost his ability to walk.
Today: I’m sitting on a dining room chair pre-

tending to work on an assignment. I’m home for the 
weekend, visiting my family. While it might seem 
like I’m typing the Spanish paper due Monday, in 
reality I’m gazing out at my brother, peering through 
the foggy glass window.

I can see the visible difference between him and 

his seventh-grade friends. While they run, jump 
and shoot baskets, he sits in his scooter looking on 
longingly. The other boys have grown taller, stron-
ger and faster. They’ve reached that point where 
athletic ability really starts to show. This time in 
boys’ lives sticks with me so clearly because when 
my brother Sam was this age, he was the fastest kid 
I knew. Joseph, however, has been unable to move 
like his friends for a while now. His athletic ability is 
reduced to essentially throwing a ball from a sitting 
position while his friends play the Joe-Joe version of 
whatever the sport of the day is.

This stark difference between my brother and his 

peers breaks my heart.

His friends are so good to him, though: They 

accommodate him when they play baseball in the 
sweltering heat of our cul-de-sac or come get my 
mom when he has to come inside to the bathroom. 
But it doesn’t change one simple fact: Joseph can’t 
walk.

Joseph can’t walk. Those words really hit me 

whenever I write them or say them out loud. The 
unfairness of that statement is not even something I 
can begin to unpack.

Although Joseph can’t walk, and it pains me to 

accept that, he can hug me. I hug him every chance 
I get, because I know one day, those beautiful, per-
fect arms won’t be able to wrap tightly around me 
anymore. Hugs are luckily one of Joseph’s favorite 
things, so I get them whenever I ask.

People always ask me or my family what it’s like to 

live with this, but it’s hard to explain to people who 
haven’t experienced this situation the pain of watch-
ing the person you grew up with struggle so much. 

The bond between siblings is unexplainable and so is 
the relationship I’ve been lucky enough to have with 
my brothers. So after growing up building forts and 
sandcastles, pestering our parents and having each 
other’s backs, Joseph’s sickness feels so heavy.

I couldn’t tell you how he approaches it with such 

strength, but I know my spirit feels meek in compari-
son to the resilience he displays as he smiles up at 
me when I carry him to his wheelchair, help him off 
the couch and lift him when he lies down and can’t 
get back up.

I feel defeated when I think of his heart giving out, 

his lungs ceasing to breathe. I feel so angry when I 
think of the trivial complaints I make every day that 
can’t even begin to compare to the prognosis he’s 
been given.

I think about the cards my family has been dealt 

every day. It’s funny to look back at my 20 years of 
life now because I could tell you exactly where the 
split is between my life before Duchenne and my life 
after. A lot of things fell apart and changed between 
these two very distinct time periods. I can remember 
as a child planting vegetables in the backyard with 
my dad, or singing along to Bob Seger with my broth-
er Sam. These memories are like blurs of color and 
youth. They are joyful, but distant.

After the diagnosis, my memories are different—

clearer, sharper. These new memories include more 
pain. They include tears and more self-doubt. They 
also include happier times; just in this half of my life, 
there’s also something else hovering over the Christ-
mas mornings and the movie nights. It’s like this 
dark cloud kind of just sitting there, waiting for the 
right moment, when you’ve forgotten about it, to tell 
you that things will never be completely OK again.

But, in spite of all of this, in spite of the pain, the 

tears and the fear of the future, I know Joseph is a 
gift to me. I know what a privilege and responsibility 
I have because I was given not one, but two young-
er brothers to care for and love. I know how much 
Joseph loves me when we’re FaceTiming and he asks 
“Katie, when are you coming home?” I know how 
hard my parents work to create a life for us that is full 
of experiences and joy. And finally, I know that no 
matter how much I think the statement “everything 
happens for a reason” is absolute bullshit, Joseph — 
not his disease — is here for a purpose.

Joseph is here because he knows how to make 

my mom, my cousins and I laugh until we cry with 
his selfie-stick poses at Christmas. Joseph is here 
because he is such a good friend to the neighbors 
who knock on the door at godforsaken hours of the 
morning asking if he’s ready to play. Joseph is here 
because he shamelessly orders a full slab of ribs at 
any restaurant they’re available when we all know he 
won’t finish it. Joseph is here because he’s the fun-
niest 13-year-old you’ll ever meet and his rendition 
of “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” theme song is strik-
ingly accurate.

Joseph is here because he defines who he is as 

a person, even though Duchenne tries so hard to. 
Joseph is here because although he can’t walk or run, 
his spirit makes him seem like he can fly. And Joseph 
is here because he is a representation of strength that 
I will never comprehend.

Joseph is here because he has taught me how to be 

brave, and for that, I will always be grateful.

just behind the Second Tallest Palm Tree on the 
Lot, and he found an angry chameleon nestled in 
the mulch between two tropical shrubs. He spent 
10 minutes wondering at a strip of black burlap 
sticking inexplicably out of the middle of a man-
grove tree, and then finally tripped over a fallen 
coconut and fell face first into a pile of dog shit, 
which he now realized had been the source of the 
smell all along. He stuck his head up and looked 
around for the Metaphor, hoping against hope 
that it wasn’t the shit on his face. His eyes ulti-
mately settled on the only viable alternative in 
sight — two French bulldogs engaged in a battle 
of wills over the offending coconut lying at his 
feet.

He began writing then and there, shit-faced as 

he was, hoping that he might be able to squeeze 
a story out of the Metaphor tussling with itself in 
front of him. It came out like this:

What do I do with my Irony?, the Writer thought 

to himself. Do I give it to my Characters or do I 
keep it for myself? Should I hang it on the Scenery 
like wallpaper, or tie it around a tree in the corner 
of the yard? Do I plaster it across a locked door like 
police tape, or do I hang it on the doorknob like a 
“Do Not Disturb” sign or, better yet, a necktie that 
lets everyone know I’m having sex in there? Maybe 
I should just let it out into the yard so it can enter-
tain itself — I hate taking it for walks, and people 
always want to stop me and ask what breed it is. Is 
it Dramatic Irony?, they say. Or Situational Irony? 
Where did you get it from? Does your Irony have 
a pedigree? It won’t bite, will it? I bet you got it 
to pick up chicks, didn’t you? Doesn’t it have lots 
of health problems? I read an article the other day 
about how Irony is so inbred and disfigured it can 
hardly stand up, let alone play with other Liter-
ary Devices. Is that true? I hear it sinks if it falls 
in the pool, and you have to wipe its ass every time 
it takes a shit or else it gets infections — isn’t that 
a lot of work? It’s kind of cute I guess, but I don’t 
like the noises it makes. Don’t they keep you up at 
night?

The truth is that I do not really like my Irony, 

the Writer thought, and its noises do keep me up at 
night. They’re really quite awful. If it were up to me 
I would poison it, shoot it three times, beat it across 
the face with a shoe and then dump it in a river 
tied up in a burlap sack. Irony is one of those types 
that shows up in the middle of the Apocalypse look-
ing like a stray that might also be God. You take 
its advice on whether or not to give your son an 
aspirin, and the next thing you know it’s dictat-
ing foreign policy. The right thing to do is brutally 
murder it, drag the body out to a polytechnic uni-
versity, then melt it down in a cauldron at 4:30 in 
the morning and be done with the thing.

But I don’t have any friends at the polytechnic 

university, the Writer thought, so I’ll have to find 
something else to do with my Irony. Maybe I could 
pass it along to one of my relatives, like a fruitcake, 
or bring it to the Humane Society and let them 
euthanize it. Maybe if I threw enough money at 
it, it would leave me alone and buy itself a house 
somewhere far away — so far I wouldn’t be able 
to hear it snorting when I’m trying to fall asleep. I 
might be able to leave it at a convent, he thought, 
or convince a priest that it needs to be burned at 
the stake. But, God damn it, he thought, I just need 
to put it somewhere so I can get back to living my 
life!
