In repatriation

of Native
Americans have laid claims.
Speaking before the Senate
Advisory Committee on Univer-
sity Affairs, Vice President for
Research Stephen Forrest and
Toni Antonucci, an associate
vice president for research and
chair of the University's Cul-
turally Unidentifiable Human
Remains Committee, described
the University's current efforts
to implement a plan to repatriate
* culturally unidentifiable human
remains and associated funeral-

related objects in the University's
possession.
The two outlined recom-
mendations put forward by the
CUHR Committee and discussed
recent changes to the Universi-
ty's legal obligations, which came
as the result of a court decision
in March over provisions of the
Native American Graves Protec-
tion and Repatriation Act of 1990,
and the progress University offi-
cials have made in adjusting to
the new regulations.
The change requires institu-
tions like the University to alert
Native American tribes that
there is a possibility that "cultur-
ally identifiable" remains found
in the same region as the tribe
may be repatriated to the tribe.
In its report, released publicly
on Sept. 24, the CUHR Commit-
tee recommended that Univer-
sity officials take nine steps to
move forward with its repatria-'
tion work.
Among those recommenda-
tions, the committee said the
University should hire two dedi-
cated employees, one to deal with
requests from Native American
groups for possession of the cul-
turally unidentifiable human
remains, and the other to work
with University museum officials
to better inventory the remains
currently held at the University.

At World Stem Cell
Summit, politicians,
scientists stress
benefits of research
By STEPHANIE STEINBERG
Daily NewsEditor
DETROIT - While the fields of
science and politics often clash on
their views of stem cell research,
leaders from both groups are gath-

ering this week in hopes of bridg-
ing the gap between them.
Nearly 1,200 researchers, law-
makers, businessmen and patient
advocates from 20 countries are
attending the 2010 World Stem
Cell Summit at the Marriott Hotel
in the Detroit Renaissance Cen-
ter. The three-day event kicked
off yesterday with speeches from
University President Mary Sue
Coleman, Michigan State Univer-
sity President Lou Anna K. Simon,
Wayne State Interim President
Allan Gilmour, Democratic Gov.

Jennifer Granholin, Sen. Carl
Levin (D-Mich.) and several lead-
ing researchers at the University.
Bernard Siegel, founder of the
World Stem Cell Summit and
director of the Genetics Policy
Institute - a Florida-based orga-
nization that calls itself "the voice
of the stem cell community" - said
one of the main goals of the sum-
mit is to increase understanding
between scientists and citizens
who find it a "big challenge" to
comprehend scientific presenta-
tions.

"We know that our scientific
colleagues speak in tongues," Sie-
gel said to summit attendees. "It's
hard to understand what they're
saying for someone who might not
be wellversed in stem cell biology."
Granholm began her keynote
address by acknowledging that
not many politicians speak before
groups of scientists. However, she
informed the audience composed
of several hundred research-
ers that she identifies with their
endeavors.

FINANCING YOUR EDUCATION
Duncan: College affordability
crucial to economic recovery

Education Sec. says
Obama made strides
in streamlining
financial aid process
By BETHANYBIRON
Daily StaffReporter
in a conference call with col-
lege journalists yesterday, Unit-
ed States Secretary of Education
Arne Duncan partnered with
MTV's Vice President of Public
Affairs, Jason Rzepka, and Presi-

dent of the College Board, Gaston
Caperton, in a discussion about
the importance of college afford-
ability in increasing graduation
rates and improving the national
economy.
Duncan said that while prog-
ress has been made during the
Obama administration toward
increasing student funding and
simplifying the financial aid
process, there is still much work
to be done in order to fulfill
Obama's goal of being the lead-
ing country globally in college
graduates.
"The President's goal can only

be attained if an unprecedented
number of Americans enroll in
and then complete college, and
for millions of students, paying
for college is the biggest barrier
to completion," Duncan said. "So
one of our most important tasks
is to make college more afford-
able."
Obama increased Pell Grant
funding by $40 billion when he
signed the higher education bill
last May. The increased funding
allowed an additional 2.4 million
students to receive the grant.

to success
By JORDAN ROCHELSON
For the Daily
Getting home can be a bit of a
challenge after a night of partying,
as can getting up the next morning
to make it down to the stadium in
time for kickoff. But thanks to a
local student-run business, both

have become a little easier for stu-
dents on campus.

when Business junior Calvin Sche-

decided to take their company on
the road.
Over the past year, the business,
which offers rides in carriages
powered by peddling drivers, has
blossomed - upgrading its fleet
from two pedicabs to three. The
founders attribute the success in
large part to what Schemanski has

learned about running a business
in University classrooms, but also
what the two have gained from
experience.
While the pair continues to

key, Lycka said they plan to offer
their services exclusively in Ann
Arbor throughout the winter.
Lycka said the company will add
canopies to the pedicabs and offer

might eventually become "too
snowy to work with."

Shooting spree kills
two, wounds five
A gunman driving around
Gainesville in a red pickup truck
went on a shooting spree yesterday
afternoon, leaving two people dead
and five others wounded, police
said.
Police originally told The
Gainesville Sun that the gunman
was among those shot but later
would only tell The Associated
Press that he was no longer at large.
The gunman shot seemingly
unrelated people, starting around
4 p.m., Gainesville police Cpl.
Tscharna Senn said. Five people
were shot within city limits, while
the other two were shot in Alachua
County, Senn said.
There was no immediate motive
for the shootings.
" "We have no idea right now,
absolutely none," Senn told the
Gainesville Sun. "It appears to be
random."
Senn would not tell the AP
whether the suspect was dead,
wounded or arrested.
Gainesville Police Capt. Ed Book
told the Sun earlier that the suspect
had been pulled over and shot him-
self.
"We believe we're with the sus-
pect and the vehicle, and there is
no one out there running around,"
Book said earlier.

Obama was briefed on the situ-

"We are concerned enough to

Police seize millions
in drug money
Colombia's defense minister says
authorities have seized $29 million

The official, Rodrigo Rivera, says
the money belonged to drug traf-
fickers including Daniel "El Loco"
Barrera. Authorities are offering
a $2.7 millon reward for Barrera's
capture.
Rivera says authorities have now
seized more than $140 million in
cash in the past month in an opera-
tion involving the cooperation of
U.S. customs officials.
Officials say several billions of
dollars in bulk cash are smuggled

Officials say much of it comes

developed the Income-Based
Repayment Plan, which allows
students embarking on public
service careers to delegate 15
percent of their incomes toward
loan repayment, and have their
delt forgiven after 10 years in
the field. They have also sim-
plified the "far too long, far too.
confusing" FAFSA form to make
it "significantly shorter, simpler
and more user friendly," Duncan
said.
"We eliminated that barrier
and we think that will help mil-
lions of students go forward and
explore their heart, pursue their
passion and not be saddled in
debt that prevents them from
doing that," Duncan said.
Duncan said reform and
increased funding for higher
education is crucial to yield-.
ing more college graduates and
developing skills necessary to
improve America's economy.
"We fundamentally believe
that education has to be the great
equalizer in America," Duncan
said. "We have to educate our
way to a better economy."
Caperton - who, in addi-
tion to his role with the College
Board, is also the former gover-
nor of West Virginia - echoed
Duncan's sentiments, saying
that getting a college degree is
crucial in securing a job and in
helping to increase economic
standards.
"A college degree today is
more important than it's ever
been, particularly in this global
society," Caperton said.
According to Caperton, only
56 percent of students gradu-
ate from a four-year institution
within six years and only 27 per-
cent graduate from community
colleges during the same time
span.
"What we don't want to see at
all are people wasting their time
in high school, coming to college
and not .completing their edu-
cation," Caperton said. "That's
really a double loss. Not only is
it difficult to pay, but also not to
get their reward of a college edu-
cation."
Caperton said student finan-
cial difficulties are the result of
the larger challenges the coun-
try has faced in dealing with
finances in recent years. Because

of this, he said, America is going
through a "readjustment period"
and will take time to rebuild.
"The difficulty we have today
in this country is we have lived
way beyond our means," Caper-
ton said. "People have under-
saved, we've over-spent, we've
had more cars and bigger houses
than we can often afford and the
government has not balanced
its budget but has spent more
money than it has."
Rzepka said that his main job
is to "use MTV's superpowers
for good," adding that he aims to
do this through encouraging col-
lege graduation rates. In 2005,
MTV, the Gates Foundation and
Viacom created "Get Schooled,"
a 5-year campaign that empha-
sizes completing high school
and preparing students both
academically and mentally for
college completion.
"It's no secret that young peo-
ople today are facing significant
educational barriers," Rzepka
said, "barriers that prevent
them from getting an education,
that prevent them for success
in life, barriers that previous
generations didn't face. And at
the same time, the future of our
country and the United States'
standing in the world has never
been more dependent on the job
we do in educating young Amer-
icans."
The group recently launched a
contest called the "Get Schooled
College Affordability Chal-
lenge" which calls for students
to brainstorm how to create a
simpler financial aid process.
According to Rzepka, there
are 2 million college students
each year who fail to apply for
the close to 70 billion dollars-
worth of funding provided
through financial aid. He said he
hopes this contest will make the
funds more accessible.
"This competition calls on
young people and college stu-
dents nationwide to harness
the power of technology and
to re-imagine the financial aid
process," Rzepka said. "We're
calling on young people to use
new, innovative digital tools that
make it easier for college stu-
dents to find money for school."
The contest ends on Dec. 17,
2010 and the winning group will
receive $10,000. In addition,
MTV and the College Board will
try to bring the winning idea to
fruition.

Pakistani closure
of supply line draws
militant attacks.
ISLAMABAD (AP) - Hundreds
of U.S. and NATO trucks carrying
fuel and other supplies for troops
in Afghanistan lie idle. Dramatic
images of Taliban attacks on these
convoys are splashed across front
pages in this anti-American coun-
try with a U.S.-allied government.
Pakistan's shutting of a key
supply line for coalition troops
in Afghanistan and the appar-
ent ease with which militants are
attacking the stranded convoys are
shaking an already uncomfortable
relationship between Washington
and Islamabad.
The tension comes just as Wash-
ingtonis steppingupitsshadowwar
on militants harbored in Pakistan's
border regions. CIA missile attacks,
which have killed dozens of insur-
gents including some high-ranking
al-Qaida operatives, are running at
record levels - a sign of America's
impatience with Pakistan's inaction
in some parts of the frontier.

Antonucci explained that

Outside observers might presume
that collections of bone frag-

Today Robert Edwards' vision is a reality

- A quote from the Nobel Committee, after the 2010 Nobel Prize for Medicine was awarded to Robert
Edwards for the development of in vitro fertilization, as reported by Time Magazine on Monday.

A budget lesson
State cuts of education funding should be stopped
Last week, Michigan's public universities received an unfor-
tunate budgetary blow. The state's new budget, which was
passed Sept. 27, will slash funding for higher education. By
initial estimates, the cuts translate to a $9-million decrease in fund-
ing for the University. Enough cannot be said about the importance
of education. Primarily, the state's economywill increasingly depend
on jobs that require degrees from institutions of higher education.
And yet, Lansing continues to siphon funds away from education -
for primary, secondary and higher education. The state government
needs to reexamine its principles, stop the cut in funding and begin
to invest in the future leaders of the state.

Accountability is important in
our society. When you do a
job, you need to be prepared
to stand behind
it and defend the
results. From doc-
tors to lawyers
and engineers to ;
social workers, our
nation's profes-
sionals are held
accountable for
the jobs they do,
and face repercus- TYLER
sions if they fail to JONES
meet the mark. It's
this system that
ensures each indi-
vidual performs to a certain standard.
What, then, are we to make of
America's education system? It seems
that, though we are willing to hold
our doctors and lawyers account-
able, we have let our nation's educa-
tors slip by unnoticed. Children are
our nation's most precious resource.
The ability of the next generation to
compete with the best and brightest
throughout the world is of the utmost
importance. However, as school sys-
tems across the nation are increas-
ingly placed under the microscope,
it would appear that those charged
with preparing our youth are receiv-
ing a failing grade.
According to the new controversial
documentary on America's schools,
"Waiting for Superman," America
ranks 25th in math and 21st in science
of 30 developed nations. The top five
percent of American students rank
23rd out of 29 developed nations.
Since the 1970s, our nation has fall-
en behind in education. Before this
problem can be addressed, we must
determine where our education sys-
tem is lacking.
Let's use our University as an
example. At the end of each semes-
ter, students are sent a class evalua-
tion. As part of those evaluations, we
can rate the quality of the professor,
GSI and the class as a whole. From

these evaluations, faculty and admin-
istrators assess the effectiveness of
teachers, GSIs and overall classroom
instruction. This idea is not unique
to the University - colleges across
the nation have been using student
evaluations to assess the quality of
education since the 1920s. Yet, there
is disconnect between the effective
practices in higher education and
what occurs inAmerica's K-12 system.
I never filled out a class evaluation
in high school, and I certainly never
encountered a teacher evaluation.
This isn't to say that teacher evalu-
ations haven't been proposed and
supported. On the contrary, school
districts in New Jersey and Illi-
nois are putting increased support
behind teacher evaluations, much to
the chagrin of teachers' unions. Just
watching recent media coverage of
this uniquely American problem, it
becomes clear why teachers' unions
are so adamantly opposed to evalua-
tions: they would be held personally
accountable for the jobs they do in
the classrooms.
As members of the Statewide
Action & Grassroots Education Cam-
paign in Illinois lobby for paren-
tal access to teacher evaluations,
educators are fighting back harder
than ever. In response to the recent
uproar, an education expert preached
to Catalyst Chicago, an Illinois-based
publication focusing on education
matters, that making such informa-
tion public domain would "unfairly
hurt the reputation of some teach-
ers and potentially cause attempts to
crowd children into the classrooms
of other teachers." But it seems to me
that teachers who consistently fail
to educate children to a minimum
standard relinquish their right to an
untarnished reputation.
In addition to evaluations, K-12
teacher tenure must be abolished.
There is no single program as det-
rimental to the education system
as the one that protects inadequate
teachers simply because they've been

in the building for a few years. Ten-
ure makes it difficult to terminate a
teacher and protects ineffective edu-
cators from being held accountable
for their poor performance. Accord-
ing to the Hoover Institution, a con-
servative public policy think tank, a
Los Angeles union representative is
quoted as saying, "it's impossible to
get them out. It's impossible. Unless
they commit a lewd act." Tenure
must be eliminated in order for a real
assessment of educators to be pos-
sible. There must be a real threat of
termination for teachers who do not
perform in the classroom.
, High school
teachers need
better evaluations.
AlbertShanker,one-time president
of the United Federation of Teachers,
once said, "When school children
start paying union dues, that's when
I'll start representing the interests of
school children." It seems Shanker
didn't understand the purpose of
America's education system. Schools
are not public works programs, nor
do they exist for the advancement of
a union agenda. Schools exist to serve
America's youth.
But with no programs to assess
the effectiveness of a teacher and no
means of recourse if an educator is
deemed ineffective, teachers unions
have America's schools in a stran-
glehold. Until teachers can be held
accountable for the jobs they do, like
every other professional, and put the
interests of children ahead of petty
union agendas, our nation's youth
will pay the price.

The Daily reported last week that the
new budget will cut funding for all higher
education programs by 2.8 percent in the
upcoming year. The goal of the cut is to bal-
ance the state budget, which is currently
running a $484 million deficit. This is a
drop in almost $500 million from last year
for all public universities and a $9 million
loss for the University. University officials
anticipated such a cut and the University's
budget, which was passed back in June,
reflects this prediction. The state budget
also includes an increased amount of schol-
arship money available for students.
The cut in state funding shows that the
state legislature isn't properly prioritizing
higher education in Michigan. The deci-
sion to continue to decrease higher educa-
tion funding, which already represents less
than five percent of the total state budget,
is a poor decision on the part of the legis-
lature. Higher education is one of the most
valuable public resources the state can pro-
vide and it's crucial that these institutions
receive adequate state funding.
The state's economic crisis has shown
that Michigan can't continue to rely on
manufacturing jobs to recover from the
downturn. Education and research will
help create new jobs in the state - and cuts
show that the legislature doesn't under-
stand the significance of education. The

state government should reevaluate what
is important for Michigan's future and allo-
cate taxpayers' money appropriately. The
current and future job market makes a col-
lege degree essential, which is why Michi-
gan's public universities are so important.
The state has an obligation to support the
institutions that will give the next genera-
tion of Michigan workers an advantage.
While the legislators continue to take
money from education, it's important to
point out how the state uses other resourc-
es. According to the 2008 Annual Report
from the Department of Corrections, the
state spent over $2 billion on corrections
costs in that year - and corrections spend-
ing has steadily grown since 1998. And
Michigan is one of only four states that
spend more on corrections than higher edu-
cation in 2008. A more responsible choice
would be to allocate funds away from cor-
rections toward education. The state needs
to be sure that all funding to corrections are
vital and reevaluate their spending so that
higher education doesn't suffer.
Undoubtedly, somethingneeds to be done
to balance Michigan's budget. But taking
much-needed funding from higher educa-
tion isn't the answer. The state legislature
should recognize how important education
is to the future of our state and do every-
thing possible to financially support it.

STUDENT LEADERSI
A tolerant campus community

Mental health and 'U'

The University has long held diversity as
one its fundamental values. It prides itself on
actualizing this concept as part of the student
experience. This reputation attracts a variety of
individuals who contribute to the colorful mosa-
ic we have at the University. Students expect
a community that is accepting of all people,
regardless of "race, color, national origin, age,
marital status, sex, sexual orientation, gender
identity, gender expression, disability, religion,
height, weight, or veteran status," as stated in the
University's non-discrimination policy.
In light of recent events surrounding Michi-
gan Student Assembly President Chris Arm-
strong, we as student leaders, would like to
reaffirm our commitment to an inclusive and tol-
erant campus environment. Discriminatory and
prejudiced acts of any kind are not acceptable at
the University. Our university serves as a model
to other institutions around the world due to our
inclusive attitude and growth towards inter-cul-
tural maturity. We, as a student body, have and
will continue to stand together and uphold this
valuedsense of community.
Such an inclusive environment is seldom
found in society. Thus, we must take full
advantage of and protect the opportunities
that come with this acceptance: stand strong
to your unique identity, have pride in your
individuality and accomplishments and carry-
on in your passions with a steadfast determi-

nation. It's only when we all express our true
selves that we can reap the full benefits of a
diverse campus.
As Wolverines, we must take continual
action to preserve and defend all that is special
about our university. We ask that you join us
as we stand up and commit to continue making
the University an environment that promotes
congruency, acceptance and paths towards
self-actualization.

. At summit, Granholm says Michigan is
hungry' for potential stem cell revenue

From Page 1
"I just want you know that I'm a
scientist too - a political scientist
- and my lab is one of the laborato-
ries of democracy," said Granhom,
who received a Stem Cell Summit
Action National Leadership Award
for promoting stem cell research as
a way to create jobs in Michigan.
Granholm said she is thrilled
that the state is hosting the sixth.
annual summit - held for the first
time in Michigan - in conjunc-
tion with the University Research
Corridor, which is a research part-
nership between the University of
Michigan, MSU and Wayne State.
She said that "it takes a lot of
* chemistry" for the universities to
work together to not only sponsor
an important conference like this,
but also collaborate on research
projects.
In her speech, Granholm high-
lighted University of Michigan
researchers'recentsuccessincreat-
ing the state's first embryonic stem
cell line that will be used to study
human development. Granholm
said she hopes the achievement
will boost Michigan's economy by
attracting commercialization and
researchers to the state.
While it's estimated that the
summit itself will generate $1 mil-
lion for the state's economy, 'Gra-
nholm said the stem cell research
market is expected to grow from
about $100 million nationally in
2010 to about $8 billion in 2016.

"Business has been great," Lycka
said, adding the Ann Arbor service

passengers every Thursday, Friday
and Saturday night.
A trip from the fraternity house
to the Big House can be drasti-
cally shortened by getting into the
pedicab that can be seen roam-

lion," she said.
In an interview with The Michi-
gan Daily at the summit, Univer-
sity President Mary Sue Coleman
- who spoke about the University
Research Corridor in her speech -
said the field of stem cell research is
"extremely important" to the state
and the University will play a vital
role in making new research dis-
coveries.
"I think we have a unique contri-
bution to make ... and I'm just very
impressed with what's going on in
all areas," Coleman said. "There
are so many levels of work that are
important that are occurring now,
and I just feel privileged to be part
of it."
However, Coleman, who has a
background in biochemistry, said
the public should not expect mirac-
ulous cures any time soon.
"In all research like this, people
are anxious because the diseases
are so terrible," she said. "We have
to be patient because we have to
make sure things are safe."
Granholm, Levin and other
speakers at yesterday's session
stressed that embryonic stem cell
research would not have been pos-
sible in Michigan if voters had voted
down a 2008 ballot initiative which
or lifted restrictions on embryonic
stem cell research. While 45 states
allow this research, Michigan is
one of only three states that have
amended their constitutions to
include provisions for embryonic
stem cell research.
In his keynote address, Levin
said the voters are the people

who should be thanked for mak-
ing Michigan a "hub" for stem cell
research.
"Almost overnight Michigan
was transformed from a difficult
place to conduct the cutting-edge
research to one of the hot beds of
that research," Levin said.
In his speech before summit
attendees, Siegel said one of the
main reasons organizers chose
to hold the summit in Michi-
gan was because residents have
expressed their support for stem
cell research.
"Let me make it clear, the World
Stem Cell Summit would not be in
Michigan if it were not for Prop. 2,"
Siegel said.
Medical philanthropist A.
Alfred Taubman, founder of the
University's A. Alfred Taubman
Medical Research Institute, also
spoke yesterday about research
limitations before 2008 and the
struggle to pass the constitutional
amendment.
"Just two years ago our scien-
tists couldn't make new stem cells
lines," Taubman said. "Well, they
could, but they would be commit-
ting a crime and that would land
them in jail for 10 years and cost
them $10 million if they had it."
Taubman also said he's relieved
that both Michigan gubernato-
rial candidates - Republican Rick
Snyder and Democrat Virg Bernero
- support stem cell research when
the other five primary candidates
opposed it.
"(You) can vote confidently for
either a Republican or Democrat

and know that you're casting a vote
for medical science," Taubman said.
Today, Taubman will receive a
National Advocacy Award for his
research donations and efforts to
lift stem cell restrictions. In her
speech, Granholm said she appreci-
ates all that Taubman has done for
the state.
"I am a big fan not because
you are a great human being but
because you are a doer, and this
stem cell research effort in Michi-
gan is all following in your wake,"
said Granholm while addressing
Taubman.
About 14 University researchers
are expected to give presentations
or lead panel discussions during the
three-day event.
Yesterday's speakers included
Sean Morrison, the University's
director of the Center for Stem Cell
Biology, and Eva Feldman, director
of the A. Alfred Taubman Medical
Research Institute and professor of
neurology.
Morrison led a PowerPoint pre-
sentation about the role of cancer
stem cells in tumors, while Feld-
man informed the audience about
her groundbreaking human clinical
trial that is using stem cells to treat
patients with Amyotrophic Lateral
Sclerosis, or Lou Gerhig's disease.
Feldman said researchers are "on
the threshold of discovery" in terms
of stem cells and their potential.
"Not only will they help us
understand basic human biology,"
Feldman said. "They're clearly
going to help us understand disease
processes."

ARMSTRONG
From Pagel1
meeting of the semester - accus-
ing Armstrong of being aracist and
elitist.
Armstrong filed the personal
protection order against Shirvell
on Sept. 13. Armstrong said in his
request for the order that Shirvell
represented a threat to his mental
and physical security.
"Since April of this year he has
been following me throughout U of
M's campus and Ann Arbor unnec-
essarily, blogging about me exten-
sively using bias and bigotry and
poses a threat to my own personal
safety," Armstrong wrote in his
request, according to information
from a report posted on annarbor.
com.
According to the report, on one
occasion Shirvell followed one of
Armstrong's friends during a night
of bar-hopping, hoping to encoun-
ter Armstrong.
"She explained Mr. Shirvell had
been followingthem around sever-
al Ann Arbor establishments that
night with the intention of seeing
me with them," Armstrong wrote.
Shirvell also called Speaker of
the House Nancy Pelosi's office on
a number of occasions while Arm-
strong was interning there this
summer, Armstrong wrote in the
report.
"Shirvell asked Tom (Arm-
strong's supervisor) if he knew if I
was a racist and if I had affiliation
with Order of Angell when they
hired me," Armstrong wrote of the
calls. "I was told a few other times
throughout my internship in D.C.
that he called the office additional
times."
On Sept. 6,Armstrongaskedthe
University. Department of Public
Safety for an escort to the MSA
sponsored Gayz Craze because
Shirvell had been protesting out-
side his house.
"Mr. Shirvell showed up outside
my house and began protesting
me, with his sign that said 'Chris
Armstrong Watch' and had my

face with 'racist' and 'liar' writ-
ten across my face. It also had
the same picture with a swastika
superimposed on my face," Arm-
strong wrote.
The University Department of
Public Safetybanned Shirvellfrom
the Ann Arbor campus on Sept.14,
although Shirvell has appealed the
trespassing warning.
Additionally, the University
community has rallied behind
Armstrong as the story was gained
national attention.
The Senate Advisory Com-
mittee on University Affairs
condemned Shirvell's attacks on
Armstrong in a statement read at
the faculty governing body's meet-
ingyesterday.
The statement commended
Armstrong for his "strength as an
individual and as the student gov-
ernment leader for this year."
SACUA also noted that the com-
mittee finds the belief that sexual
orientation is a matter of choice
is unsupported by science. The
statement also encouraged victims
of bullying in a private or public
manner in the University commu-
nity to contact "appropriate law
enforcement authorities" on the
matter.
Last week, University President
Mary Sue Coleman also empha-
sized the importance of promoting
a safe campus environment for all
students to express themselves.
"In addition to its internal
action, the University also has
called upon others in positions of
authority to take all appropriate
action to address this situation,"
Coleman wrote in a statement
released to The Michigan Daily
last Thursday.
In addition, a number of events
and organizations have mobilized
on campus to support Armstrong.
A petition was circulated last week
by the Spectrum Center to col-
lect signatures for an advertise-
ment in support of Armstrong that
appeared in yesterday's Daily.

in Ann Arbor, said it isn't the money
that keeps him working. Rather, he
most enjoys interacting with his
clients.

"It's active, always moving and
meeting people. It's fun," Salinger
said last week. "Last night I had
some people who were singing."
"We are selling an experience
more so than just transportation,"
he said. "You would take a pedicab
more because you see it and it looks
fun and you've heard good things
about it."
Schemenski continued, "It's a
story to tell. You definitely tell your
friends about that crazy bike ride
you took."

"Man, Coolio sure let himself go."v
Jack's boat barely floats

Philip Seymour
Hoffman shows promise
behind the camera
By JENNIFER XU
Daily Arts Writer
Phillip Seymour Hoffman's direc-
torial debut seems a little late in the
coming. After all, a
man with three Oscar
nominations and a long
history of stellar per- Jack Goes
formances should hold
a pretty firm grasp on Boatng
the human condition. At the State
So while "Jack Goes Overture
Boating" - an allegory
of two innocent people
holding onto each other while the rest of
New York silently crumbles around them
- feels a bit anticlimactic on first reflec-
tion, maybe it's just overdue to the point
of being stale.
Really, everything about "Jack" is
a little wound down. Adapted from a
play by Robert Glaudini, the film tells
the story of Jack, a simple-minded limo
driver who just wants to find a serious
relationship. As the protagonist, Hoff-

man, who's hell-bent on making himself
look as repulsive as possible, resem-
bles nothing so much as a large, fleshy
baby. When his married friends Clyde
(John Ortiz, "Public Enemies") and
Lucy (Daphne Rubin-Vega, "Flawless")
set him up with the slightly odd, sexu-
ally paranoid Connie (Amy Ryan, "Gone
Baby Gone"), Jack's newborn demeanor
cracks a little to show his general inex-
perience.
If Jack were a girl, he'd probably get
a makeover and go shopping. Instead, he
just learns how to swim and cook a meal.
And slowly, as Jack's limited awareness
of the world increases in scope, he real-
izes that with his limo driver job and
three friends, he might not have it so bad
after all.
At its worst, "Jack Goes Boating" can
be excruciatingly dull. At best, it's relax-
ing. As a film with very little ambition in
regards to story content, "Jack" needs to
rely on characterization in order to pull
a viewer through. And though the four
actors do an admirable job of inhabiting
their respective characters, there isn't
enough fat in the screenplay to cushion
what essentially is a straightforward
parable about surviving in New York
City.
To Hoffman's credit, though, the film

never feels much like a play - there
is nary a strand of turgid, exhaus-
tive dialogue so typical in stage-based
adaptations. In fact, it might be that its
screenplay is too linear and clear-cut in
its plot progression that brings about its
unfortunate downfall.
However, the film does seem to hit its
stride somewhere in the middle third.
Jack and Connie, slightly off-kilter from
the rest of the world, do a lot of hugging
and kissing to make up for the melan-
cholic devastation leaking out of their
friends. But the best scenes happen in
the swimming pool, as Clyde patiently
teaches Jack how to hold his breath by
visualizing the little chlorine bubbles
gurgling around him. Later on, imag-
es of Jack lucidly slicing through the
water are intercut with a center shot of
him standing on a bridge practicing his
strokes while Fleet Foxes blasts in the
background.
With his debut, Hoffman has proven
his prowess behind the camera, though
his story development still needs a little
fine-tuning. But it's the little moments
in between that make the short, imper-
fect "Jack Goes Boating" a worthwhile
watch, which really speaks to the over-
lying themes of the film. As Clyde would
say, "Life is fucked up, but we get by."

"Hello. We're TV actors."
Those words, spoken by Rainn Wil-
son as he stood alongside Blake
Lively at the
2009 Golden Globes,1
were enough to incite
several seconds of
hearty laughter from
the Hollywood crowd.
And while it may seem
harmless, the remark _
and the reaction dem- CAROLYN
onstrate one important KLARECKI
stigma in the acting -
industry - some people
think TV actors are a joke.
Peter Krause? Bradley Whitford? Janu-
ary Jones? Oh, they're just TV actors. No
big deal. They're not special like Chris-
tian Bale or Natalie Portman. Those are
the real actors. They're in movies. Those
actors on the small-screen are only there
because they're not good/famous/pretty
enough for the cutthroat competition of
Hollywood movies. No, they just have to
be content wallowing in their 30-60 min-
ute time-slot, making considerably less
money and enjoying less fame.
Maybe no one states it quite so explic-
itly, but there tends to be this attitude
pervading the world of media-junkies that
TV actors are of a lesser caliber than movie
stars. TV is viewed as a stepping stone to
better gigs. And there's some truth to that.
TV actors aren't paid as much as those who
appear.in films and they generally don't
grace the "Star Watch" section of People
magazine. But that doesn't make them
inferior - just different.
Actors working on a movie usually have a
few months to film their scenes. "Pirates of
the Caribbean" was filmed in five months.
Five months spenton one project where
the actors probably weren't called to set for
half of the scheduled film days. Most TV
actors stay on for an entire season, appear-
ing in every episode, and each episode takes
a week or more to film. The first season of
"Lost" also took five months to film, but
in the end there was 1068 minutes of aired
footage. "Pirates" had a run time of 143 min-
utes. TV acting is hard. It's time-consuming
and the pay-off isn't always great.
According to TV Guide, Jon Hamm
of "Mad Men" makes $75,000 per epi-
sode, making his season's earnings about
$975,000. Forbes reports Leonardo
DiCaprio's paycheck for "Inception" was
more than $50 million. Both "Inception"
and "Mad Men" are critically acclaimed
works of art and both salaries are beyond

anything I could ever hope to earn, but
there is a huge discrepancy between them.
Hamm has filmed 49 episodes and still
hasn't reached a quarter of DiCaprio's
"Inception" money. So it's reasonable to
think that actors would only take TV gigs
if they had to.
But think of all the incredibly talented
TV actors out there. Hamm, Nathan Fil-
lion, Tina Fey and Terry O'Quinn are
all amazing actors who could make the
jump to movies any time they wanted to.
And some have. Some actors do use TV
as a stepping stone to movies, buta lot of
actors come back to it too. TV acting has
its advantages and provides challenges not
normally available in the world of film.
The beauty of the television serial is
that the characters can be much more
complex and developed than those in
movies. This gives actors a chance to get
to know a character and portray them
more dynamically than they ever would
More character
depth, less respect.
be able to in a film. There is time to under-
stand who you're playing, to explore your
character's ups and downs, to guide them
through the dark moments and to cel-
ebrate the victories.
As viewers, we have a whole season to
get to know and care about the characters
on TV. Moviegoers only spend a few hours
with the big-screen characters, and come
to forget many. We establish relationships
with the TV characters, inviting them
into our living rooms each week. We see
them regularly, and because of that, they
become a little more accessible to us. TV
actors aren't presented for us to worship
on a 30-foot screen. They don't grace us
with their talent only once each year. Peo-
ple on TV just seem much more real.
So while the stigma of TV acting may
not be totally unfounded, I beg the film
snobs to lay off. It's arguably harder to
act for the small-screen and clearly the
gig doesn't pay as well. TV actors are the
unsung heroes of the acting biz. They do it
out of love for the medium, the story and
the character, and that's something worth
admiring.

uFrench film goes lowbrow

"Not now. Still with fam. Sext u l8r."

anu's ("Train of Life") attempt at
dramedy is nothing more than a
predictable, done-before underdog
story, full of lazy character develop-
ment and tone-deaf execution.
Our underdog is Andrei Fili-
pov (Aleksei Guskov, "Ragin"), a
washed-up former conductor of
Russia's premier orchestra, the
Bolshoi. After resisting the Com-
munist Party's order to fire all
Jewish musicians, he was sacked
alongside those he tried to defend.
He has spent the decades since his
termination as a janitor, cleaning
the orchestra's building and long-
ing for the past. When he stumbles
upon an invitation for the Bolshoi to
perform at Theatre du Chatelet in
Paris, he sees a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity. By bringing his old
orchestra back together and pos-
ing as the Bolshoi, Filipov hopes to
regain his credibility and put his
life back on track.

ABC family drama
can't save evenings
from boredom
By LINDSAY HURD
Daily Arts Writer
It's a bird! It's a plane! No, wait,
it's just the Powells, the less-than-
original family of
superheroes on **
this year's token
supernatural No Ordinary
show "No Ordi-
nary Family." Fady
ABC's new spin Tuesdays
onthefamilyshow at8 p.m.
takes the idea of ABC
"The Incredibles"
and tries to make
it more realistic. Instead of trying to
save the world, the Powells use their
powers to solve "real life" issues.
Unfortunately, this mix of dread-
fully normal problems and super-
natural abilities is just downright
obnoxious.
The biggest issue with the Pow-
ell family is their lack of variation.
The family too closely resembles
the standard families of many TV
dramas, which nowadays doesn't

feel real for many viewers. Mom
(Julie Benz, "Dexter") is a success-
ful, smart and beautiful scientist
solving the all the world's prob-
lems, Dad (Michael Chiklis, "The
Shield") works for the local police
station but also loves being at home,
daughter Daphne (Kay Panabaker,
"Fame") is the semi-popular girl at
school with the cute boyfriend and
JJ (Jimmy Bennett, "Orphan") is
the lazy son who has a learning dis-
ability. Conveniently, the family has
lots of money and doesn't seem to
have a care in the world, other than
tryingto spend more time together.
"No Ordinary Family" is almost too
normaltobe real.
Though the characters aren't
inventive, "No Ordinary Family"
has a great cast of actors for the
main roles - the show's saving
graces. Chiklis plays a convinc-
ing family-man-turned-superhero,
with a teddy bear build that makes
him both threatening and love-
able. Benz once again picks up the
role of the overworked mom who
is neurotic but loving, suggesting
that this is the only character she
can play. Panabaker portrays the
perfectbratty teenage drama queen
with her cute looks, and Bennett is
equally effective. Chiklis also nar-

rates much of the show, sounding
like Danny DeVito in "Matilda" -
endearing and easy to listen to.
Despite the stellar casting, it's
just all too convenient that the pow-
ers the family gains are ones that

ALBUM REVIEW
Folds and Hornby collide

By PROMA KHOSLA
For the Daily
The William L. Clements
Library, stately neighbor to the
University president's house and
haunt for campus
history buffs, Fine Tuning
recently began a Grea
to establish new
guidelines for ColleCtion
its collections of
18th and 19th- Through Oct. 8
century media. Clements Library
The library
features a collection of primary
source materials relating to the
history of the Americas and while
a new policy for acquiring pieces
is still in the works, curators have
put together "Fine Tuning A Great
Collection: The How and Why of
Recent Acquisitions," an exhibi-
tion that exemplifies the goals of
their new collecting guidelines.
Notable pieces in this exhibi-
tion include letters from Susan
B. Anthony and Harriet Beecher
Stowe, and an original handwrit-
ten version of Daniel D. Emmett's
"Dixie" from when the writer was

84. The graphics case features
paintings of New York City ("View
of the Ruins after the Great Fire
in New York") and Philadelphia
("Philadelphia from the Jersey
Shore"), as well as a trompe l'oeil
of Abraham Lincoln, a painting-
within-a-painting that creates a
three-dimensional illusion.
"It's a very ... eclectic collec-
tion in this exhibit," said Brian
Dunnigan, associate director and
map curator. "The idea was to cut
across all our divisions and give
some sense of the different kinds
of things we collect and also try to
answer the question of how we col-
lect and why we collect, and how
they fit into the broader holdings in
the library. We're collecting with
real purpose in mind in an attempt
to be able to support scholarship
the best way we possibly can."'
Dunnigan also discussed the
organizational structures of the
collection and library, which at this
point in the process remain stable.
"We collect, for the most part,
from European discovery of Amer-
ica until about 1900. The exhibi-
tion covers a number of formats

and the organization of the exhibit
is set up like our organization here
at the library itself," Dunnigan
said. "The new policy will limit the
time period and scope of subject
matter in the library. This is part-
ly defined in the exhibit, where
the chronological cutoff point for
media is 1900, with the exception
of photographs and wartime cor-
respondence."
The library and the exhibition
are organized by four main divi-
sions: books, manuscripts, maps
and graphics. The library has also
found a decent-sized collection of
cookbooks, menus, advertisements
and information on the food ser-
vice industry, which are kept track
of by the curator of culinary his-
tory, but remain divided based on
medium. Graphics include imag-
es, prints and some photography
from the late 19th and early 20th
centuries. The map division col-
lects cartography of the Western
hemisphere and the manuscript
division deals mostly with hand-
written letters and original work,
which encompasses the library's
most famous pieces.

Michigan coach Rich Rodriguez's offense is among the best in the country. The defense is a different story.
Skewed time of possession
deepens 'M' defensive woes

r

By TIM ROHAN
Daily Sports Editor
Check out the Michigan football
team's offensive and defensive stats.
They're polar opposites. On offense,
you'll find national rankings in the
top 20 for most
categories. The NOTEBOOK
defense, on the
other hand, is the worst in the coun-
try at stoppingthe pass, allowing an
average of 307 yards per game.
During Monday's press con-
ference, Michigan coach Rich
Rodriguez addressed the contrast
between his two units. On offense,
the players have gained experi-
ence and the execution on the field
matches that. The defense can't say
the same.
"I think there's some moments
on defense where we have gotten a
little bit better but there's also some
things we have not gotten better at
and it's going to take a little more
time," Rodriguez said. "Some of it is
goingto be coming with experience,
and as they get more reps, but you
know, we are not a real deep team
over there."
Because of the brevity of the
Wolverines' drives against Indiana,
the Michigan defense was forced to
spend a lot of time on the field. The
Hoosiers held the ball for nearly 42
minutes. Part of that was the Wol-
verines' offensive efficiency, but the
other ingredient was the defense's
inability to stop the Hoosiers on
third down - they converted 11-of-
19.
Rodriguez estimated that several
defensive players were on the field
for more than 100 snaps, while the
offense was on the field for less than
half of that. And when Michigan's

starters got tired on defense, Rodri-
guez was forced to play less experi-
enced backups.
"You're leery to take them out
because the next guy in is not close
to him from a physical or experi-
ence standpoint," Rodriguez said.
"We are in a tough, tough situation,
but we have to just keep battling
through that. And the best way to
limit that is to get more three and
outs, to get more shorter posses-
sions and hopefully get a few turn-
overs."
There were some positives to take
away, even though the Wolverines
allowed 568 yards of total offense.
Rodriguez said that Michigan did
tackle better, which has been a
point of frustration this season.
As Rodriguez sees it, the Wolver-
ines are still 5-0, which is the most
important statistic.
"We have won and it's like win-
ning a prize and winning $10,000
and being all upset because you
have to pay taxes on half of it,"
Rodriguez said. "Still going to take
the money, you know, and be happy
with it and we won. May not be as
excited as taking home money but
you're still taking half."
ROBINSON GOES DEEP: Sopho-
more quarterback Denard Robinson
wasn't completely perfect last Sat-
urday against the Hoosiers.
He did win his third Big Ten
Player of the Week award of the sea-
son and posted 494 total yards and
five touchdowns, but there were a
couple of deep passes that Robinson
could have connected on in the sec-
ond half.
"He's missing three out of ten,
that's not bad," Rodriguez said. "He
missed a couple on Saturday, the
one wide open to Junior (Heming-


way) - he would love to have that
one back. But he's really been pretty
good at it for the most part. But a
lot of it is just a little bit of touch on
it and he'll get better the more we
throw with it but I've really been
pleased with his accuracy for the
most part."
Robinson still finished with
career highs in passing yards (277)
and passing touchdowns (3) and
completed 10-of-16 passes.
RIVALRY WEEK STARTS NOW:
Michigan has lost to its in-state
rivals from East Lansing each of the
past two seasons.
Now the excitement on both
sides is at its most intense in years
- both teams are 5-0 and ranked
in the top-25. The Wolverines have
always placed a great deal of impor-
tance on the matchup.
"They are all big, but this one is
bigger," Rodriguez said. "The rival-
ry games are always bigger. I'msure
they will tell you the same thing. It's
a huge thing for both teams every
year. The more you win, there's
more at stake and there's more at
stake this year because both teams
are undefeated."
INJURY REPORT: Rodriguez said
that no new names were on the
injury list after the game against
Indiana.
Rodriguez did note that junior
running back Michael Shaw and
fifth-year senior nose tackle Greg
Banks were fine. Redshirt freshman
running back Fitzgerald Toussaint
is day-to-day.
And to keep Robinson fresh for
Saturday, Rodriguez said the quar-
terback would be limited in prac-
tice, as would some of the defensive
players who had extensive playing
time.

Daily Sports
Power Rankings
Nick Spar 11 Daily Sports Editor
1 Denard Robinson, Quarterback (Football)
It's hard to imagine that, just a month ago, the early-season Heisman frontrunner wasn't even Mich-
igan's clear-cut starter. With each zigzagging run and touchdown pass, we easily forget just how lost
he looked under center at times last season, especially when he tried to pass the ball. But here's what's
easy to remember: the Wolverines wouldn't have salvaged victories over Notre Dame or Indiana (or
Massachusetts,efor that matter) if it weren't for Shoelace.While Tate Forcier led his owngame-winning
drives over the Fighting Irish and the Hoosiers ayear ago, only a quarterback who seems to dominate at
will on every snap can compensate for the miserable state of the Wolverines' defense.
Lexi Zimmerman, Setter (Women's Volleyball)
Despite a 1-1 record last weekend for the volleyball team, Zimmerman stays put at No. 2. For starters,
the loss came to No. 4 Penn State, a team akin to John Wooden's UCLA Bruins in the realm of college
athletics. (The Nittany Lions have won 115 of their last 117 matches, dating back to 2007.) In that match,
as well as the team's victory against Ohio State, Zimmerman managed to post more than 30 assists
and more than 10 kills. With each assist, she's inching her way closer to the all-time Big Ten record.
And none of the Michigan athletes who tie their shoes or cleats or skates had incredible eye-popping
performances in the last week, so Zimmerman still deserves the hype more than a week after breaking
the Michigan assists record. Besides the football team, only the volleyball team has more than one of
its players in the rankings (see No. 5). 4
3 Nkem Ezurike, Forward (Women's Soccer)
Ezurike is climbing the rankings after yet another clutch performance on Saturday. She scored a
game-tying goal in a double-overtime 1-1 draw against Northwestern. It was already the second.time
this season she scored a game-tying goal that helped the Wolverines earn a draw. The freshman has
six goals in her first 10 collegiate games.
Michigan Offensive Line (Football)
The offensive line had an entirely different role against Indiana than it did against Bowling Green.
Only two players - Denard and Vincent Smith - had carries against the Hoosiers, whereas virtually
every running back and quarterback on the Wolverines' roster had a carry against the Falcons. At
times, the line didn't open up enough holes for Smith. But as long as the offense is putting up its usual
42 points per game, the unit as a whole is doing enough to hold its spot in my book.
S Alex Hunt, Outside Hitter (Volleyball)
Hunt has been arguably the most consistent player for Michigan this season, maybe even more
consistent than Zimmerman. She has tallied 250 kills, more than double that of any other Wolverine.
Thirty of them came last weekend, but her high level of play is nothingnew, as two weeks ago she was
named BigTen Player of the Week.
Junior Hemingway, Wide Receiver (Footbqll)
Hemingway surges into the rankings after hauling in the most important pass of the day
against Indiana - a slightly underthrown ball that he went up and grabbed with less than 30
seconds left in a tie game. The 42-yard reception brought the ball to the Hoosiers' four-yard line
and all but sealed the deal for Michigan. Hemingway also had a 70-yard touchdown catch early
in the third quarter, making him the fourth Michigan receiver this season to have 90-plus yards
in a game.
7 Sam Critser (Women's Tennis)
In just her second collegiate tournament, Critser won her section of the draw at the Wolverine
Invitational after rolling through three consecutive matches. Michigan controlled the tournament
from start to finish. Junior Michelle Sulahian won the other half of the draw and the doubles teams
took seven of their nine matches.
Roy Roundtree, Wide Receiver (Football)
Hemingway may be ranked ahead of Roundtree, but Roundtree is becoming Denard's favorite
target. He has surpassed 80 yards in three of the first five games and has totaled 14 catches for
244 yards in the last two. Roundtree also gets credit for responding well against Notre Dame (8
catches for 82 yards and a touchdown) after being injured from a huge hit in the opener against
Connecticut.
Zara Saydjari, Forward (Field Hockey)
Through two weeks, the field hockey team has taken ownership over the ninth spot. Last week,
goalkeeper Haley Jones earned the spot for posting her third shutout of the season. This week, Sayd-
jari takes Jones's place after scoring both goals in a 2-1 upset win over No. 6 Michigan State. The field
hockey team also almost took down No. 1 Maryland two days after Saydjari's performance, but the
Terrapins ultimately held on for a 4-3 win.
Danielle Tauro (Women's Cross Country)
At Michigan's first scored meet of the season, Tauro finished sixth individually at the 20-team
Wisconsin Invitational last weekend. She shattered her personal-best 6000-meter time and helped
the Wolverines to a fourth-place finish.

Early on, Glendening embracing co-captainship role

By CASANDRA PAGNI
Daily Sports Writer
After the Michigan ice hockey
team's disappointing 4-4 tie with
unranked Mercyhurst to open
the season on Saturday, Michigan
coach Red Berenson decided to
switch up the team's top line head-
ing into Sunday's exhibition contest
with Western Ontario.
Berenson moved junior co-
captain Luke Glendening from
left wing on the team's third line
to right wing on the top line. With
two goals and one assist in the Wol-
verines' 4-2 victory, it's safe to say
Glendening made the move pay off.
The Grand Rapids native spent

the latter half of last season playing
on a line with senior Louie Capo-
russo and junior David Wohlberg.
The three Wolverines netted a com-
bined 38 goals on the season, with
63 assists.
But to kick off this season,.Glen-
dening played on No. 4 Michigan's
third line with sophomore A.J.
Treais and freshman Luke Mof-
fat, while Caporusso and Wohlberg
added sophomore Chris Brown to
their line. While Caporusso scored
one goal in Saturday's game, Wohl-
berg and Glendening were kept off
the stat sheet against Mercyhurst.
On Sunday, after moving Glen-
dening to the top line, the unit
exploded offensively. The chemis-

try and familiarity among Wohl-
berg, Caporusso and Glendening
was evident. They finished the
night with a combined twelve shots
on Western Ontario netminder Josh
Unice.
With Wohlberg at left wing,
Caporusso at center, and Glenden-
ing at right wing, the line scored
three of Michigan's four goals.
Caporusso finished with three
assists on the night, and Wohlberg
added a goal and assist of his own.
"(The three of us) just know
where each other are going to be on
the ice," Glendening said after prac-
tice Monday. "We're used to playing
with each other, the spacing and all
that. It really helps when we don't
