R

ebecca Blumenstein was edi-
tor in chief of The Michigan 

Daily during her last year on staff 
while at the University. Today, she 
is deputy editor in chief at The 
Wall Street Journal. She started 
her time at the Journal in Detroit 
in 1995 before becoming the Jour-
nal’s China bureau chief from 
2005 to 2009. There, she led the 
team that won the Pulitzer Prize 
in International Reporting in 
2007.

Q: What was your experience 

like working for the Daily and what 
about it do you think was unique?

When I walked into the Daily, I 

didn’t know how to write a head-
line, I didn’t know how to write 
a news story, but I was taught by 
editors who were fellow students 
and it was a remarkable training 
ground for journalism. It really 
worked ... the most amazing thing 
about the Daily — I also met my 
husband there — was how much 
you could grow and learn how to 
do things while working with your 
peers. I never took a journalism 
class and I think it’s better that 
way because you can’t rely on any-
one else; you have to do it yourself. 
The editors were pretty demand-
ing and you worked your way up 
to other possibilities as you proved 
yourself. It was a place of excite-
ment; I don’t think my parents 
understood why I was spending 

so much time at the Daily instead 
of on my academic work. I think 
in retrospect that’s one of the best 
parts of the Daily, that it is inde-
pendent of the University and you 
get out of it what you put into it.

Q: So because, as you said, the 

Daily is completely separate from 
academic work at the University, 
how did you balance those two 
aspects of your life and how has 
that balancing act benefited your 

career?

A: I didn’t sleep much. I took a 

more-than-full course load, which 
in retrospect was silly, and I also 
chose to double major in Econ and 
Political Science through the (Res-
idential College) and I took a class 
there, “Economics of Inequal-
ity,” that really changed my life. I 
didn’t make it easy on myself — I 
would meet friends at the Brown 
Jug at midnight — but something 
about being young and not need-
ing to sleep much helped. 

Q: What advice would you give 

to current Daily staffers and recent 

graduates?

A: I would say that you have 

the advantage and disadvantage 
of being kind of on your own. You 
have to get an internship and have 
the clips and the experience and 
keep building from that. It has 
changed a little as journalism has 

changed because there are fewer 
smaller publications that offer 
internships in the way that there 
were when I was doing it, but there 
are still quite a few. It’s important 
to become a bit of a news junkie. 
It’s helped that I’ve known how to 
cover news stories, talk to people 
dealing with tragedies, and just 
being comfortable reporting on 
a range of things and hopefully 
getting the reporting and writing 
skills. 

Q: You’ve had a variety of 

internships and positions at dif-
ferent publications over the years 
— in places ranging from China to 
Florida to New York City. What 
guided you as you made those 
career decisions that ultimately 

landed you your current position as 
deputy editor in chief at The Wall 

Street Journal?

A: I am from a pretty small 

town in Michigan and I always 
wanted to work in a big newsroom 
where there were people who 
really believed in the work they 
were doing, kind of like the Daily 
was for me. There were some situ-
ations where it was clear I had 
learned as much as I was going to 
and it was time to move on. So as 
far as working at the Journal, it’s 
just been a very stimulating place 
to be from the moment I walked 
in. I am always amazed by the 
level of discussion and challenge 
here, and the nice thing about 
being at a news organization is 
that I’ve had a variety of different 
jobs, but I’ve stayed at this same 
news organization for 20 years.

M

ost people spend their 
college years preparing 

for the job they’ll have after gradu-
ation.

But for Jeremy Peters, a Daily 

alum who now works as a political 
reporter for The New York Times, 
the job overtook the preparation 
while he was still in college — and 
he’s still doing it 16 years later.

During his time at The Michi-

gan Daily, Peters, a 2002 graduate 
of the University, covered the 2000 
presidential campaign as a news 
reporter and editor. Today, he is 
covering the 2016 campaign for the 
Times, with a focus on Republican 
candidates. 

Q: What’s most memorable about 

your time at the Daily?

I was fortunate enough to have 

been at Michigan during a presi-
dential election year — this was 
2000, and so it was when Bush was 
running against Gore and at the 
time Michigan was a very impor-
tant swing state, kind of more so 
than it is now because there was 

actually some hope that Repub-
licans could win it. So the Daily 
would send us out, me and a couple 
other reporters who were assigned 
to the politics beat, to cover these 
campaign events, from Flint, to 
Lansing, all over the state. And we 
would pile into a University-owned 
station wagon or something like 
that with a photographer and head 
out to these big events and it was 
really a great learning experience 
because it’s not all that often that 
college students are able to experi-
ence first-hand a presidential cam-
paign like that and surprisingly, the 
campaigns were very accommo-
dating of Daily reporters who were 
covering it.

Q: What was it like being a stu-

dent reporter, getting your first 

experiences with reporting at these 
campaign events where there are 
a lot of national, professional news 

organizations around?

I guess the thing was, is I always 

— maybe this was arrogant on my 
part, or the youthful inexperience 

of a 20 year old, but I kind of always 
just considered myself to be a pro-
fessional reporter right from the 
get-go, and I kind of expected to be 
treated as such. 

That was the thing that the 

Daily always instilled in me, was 
this sense that what we were doing 
was very important and it was a 
task to be taken very seriously.

Q: Beyond the 2000 campaign, is 

there any news story that stands out 
to you from your time at the Daily?

9/11 happened when my class 

was editors. And I happened to 
be the news editor on duty that 
day, that Tuesday, September 11th. 
And that was certainly a horrify-
ing experience, but also kind of one 
that really, I think, energizes your 
sensibilities as a reporter and really 
requires you to make decisions 
and judgment calls that you really 
never, in a way, never anticipated 
having to do.

And it was also, even more 

importantly, it was an experience 
that showed us we could all work 
together and be the best versions of 
ourselves when the paper and the 
University needed us to be.

Q&A: with Jeremy Peters

Managing photo 
editor landed on 
the presidential 
campaign trail

By LEV FACHER

Managing Editor

Fresh out of college and in 

search of a short-term gig as a 
campaign photographer, David 
Katz marched into the Chicago 
campaign office of a young, rela-
tively unknown state senator 
in 2004, armed with a portfo-
lio full of clips from his time as 
The Michigan Daily’s managing 
photo editor.

The campaign manager was 

impressed, and hired Katz on 
the spot. But the push for the 
open U.S. Senate seat was in its 
early stages and tight on cash, so 
Katz and the campaign manager 
struck a deal: He could start as a 
volunteer, and if their candidate 
prevailed in the Democratic pri-
maries on March 16, Katz would 
become a paid staffer.

“I said, ‘That sounds good,’ 

” Katz recalled. “ ‘When do I 
start?’ ”

The manager asked Katz to 

show up the next day. The candi-
date would be at a church on the 
South Side of Chicago.

So he showed up at the 

church, photographed the event 
and followed the candidate to 
his car. The candidate gave him 
a confused look.

“I said, ‘Oh, maybe they didn’t 

tell you,’ ” Katz remembered. 
“But the campaign manager told 
me to photograph you and follow 
you around. He said, ‘Great — 
jump in.’ ”

That was Katz’s first interac-

tion with Barack Obama.

The 
two 
quickly 
became 

friends, spending as many as 14 
hours per day, six days per week 
together on the campaign trail. 
In the years that followed, both 
during Obama’s time as senator 
and as president, their friendship 
prevailed, manifesting in regular 
rounds of golf.

Katz ended up moving to 

Washington, D.C. after Obama’s 
victory to work for the senator, 
before heading west to earn his 
MBA at Stanford.

His time at the White House 

was far from over, however. 
When Obama’s 2008 presiden-
tial campaign kicked into high 
gear, Katz returned as a cam-
paign photographer, chronicling 
the senator as he traveled the 
country.

But as Katz followed Obama 

to Dublin, Ohio, for a campaign 
event that August — barely two 
months away from the general 
election — there was still some-
body he hadn’t met. Katz remem-
bers Obama’s words to this day:

“Senator Biden, this is David 

Katz. He was the photo editor 
of The Michigan Daily, and as a 
Michigan grad, I’m sorry that we 
have to bring him here so close to 
Columbus.”

The 44th president has a fond-

ness for the University, it seems 
— in his seven years in office, he’s 

made three trips to Ann Arbor. 
In 2010, Katz tagged along to see 
the president deliver an address 
to the graduates at Spring Com-
mencement.

“I got to ride on Marine One 

with him and land right next to 
the Big House and point some 
things out as we were in the air, 
like, ‘That’s the Michigan golf 
course, that’s where campus is.’ 
He appreciated those things.”

At that point, Katz was work-

ing in the White House as a 
special assistant to the energy 
secretary. He later became a 
senior policy adviser for manu-
facturing before departing for 
the private sector. The move 
brought him to San Francisco, 
where he currently serves as 
the director of sales at Quid, 
a research and data analytics 
startup.

Wherever his career has taken 

him, though, Katz says the time 
he spent at the Daily has proved 
invaluable.

“Everybody’s used to working 

on deadline and working quick-
ly,” Katz said. “The pace at which 
The Michigan Daily operates is 
similar to the pace of a presiden-
tial campaign.”

All current and former Daily 

staffers know the pace at 420 
Maynard Street can indeed 
be tough to handle. However, 
knowing the prospect of hearing 
the president of the United States 
utter the phrase “The Michigan 
Daily” isn’t entirely out of the 
realm of possibility makes the 
frenetic work environment just 
a bit more manageable.

By JENNIFER CALFAS

Editor in Chief

Ann Marie Lipinski’s name 

doesn’t just grace the wall — it 
illuminates it.

Her name, sitting alongside 

seven others, hangs on the wall at 
the entrance of the Daily’s news-
room — noting her Pulitzer Prize 
from 1987 that she received for 
her work as editor of the Chicago 
Tribune — where she was the first 
female editor.

But her legacy goes beyond just 

that. As a co-editor of The Michi-
gan Daily in 1977, she led a team 
of intrepid reporters. After her 
tenure at the Tribune, she became 
the curator of Harvard Universi-
ty’s prestigious Nieman Founda-
tion for Journalism — becoming 
the first woman to do so.

Changing history is a trend for 

Lipinski, it seems. But she doesn’t 
let her game-changing tendencies 
halt her from giving back to the 
place that gave so much to her: 
The Michigan Daily.

For me, as another female edi-

tor in chief of the Daily, her legacy 
has had a powerful impact on me. 
Her story and drive are inspiring 
for not just women, but all Daily 
alumni. In honor of our 125th 
anniversary, I was lucky enough 

to talk with Lipinski about all 
things journalism, Daily and 
beyond.

LIPINSKI: The Daily has a big 

birthday coming up and you’re 
about to be overrun with a lot of 
nostalgic alumni. I’ve thought so 
often about the deep impact that 
place had on me, how virtually 
all of my journalistic values were 
shaped by something that hap-
pened to me there. What do you 
think accounts for the power of 
the experience?

CALFAS: There’s something 

powerful about the experience of 
working at the Daily that seems 
to be so difficult to describe. I’ve 
met so many alumni who have 
all told me working at the Daily 
was the best decision they ever 
made. But I think the reasoning 
behind this can be best summed 
up in the words of another editor 
I’ve worked alongside with over 
the past few years: the Daily is 
addictive. Once you walk through 
the doors of 420 Maynard, you 
become enthralled by what this 
place has to offer. You become 
a different person — one who 
chooses to spend 50 hours (or 
even more...) a week inside this 
building, instead of going to class 
or partying each weekend with 
friends. This addiction may come 

from the fact that everyone in the 
newsroom shares it; everyone 
shares the drive to produce work 
that serves an important purpose 
and informs our community in 
a way that nothing else can. But 
perhaps I can’t fully understand 
the full power and impact of the 
Daily until I leave in just a few 
months. For you, how did your 
experiences at the Daily help lead 
you to so many successes?

LIPINSKI: The Daily made 

us apprentices of the adult world. 
That responsibility is a great gift 
and had a very powerful impact 
on me. In my first weeks as co-
editor in chief, I recall a long Sat-
urday in the newsroom debating 
not whether our editorial would 
stand for or against the execution 
of the infamous Gary Gilmore, 
but whether our opposition to the 
death penalty should run on the 
editorial page or boldly plastered 
across Page 1 — as if the governor 
of Utah or a justice of the Supreme 
Court would be any more likely 
to see it there. … Two decades 
later, while editor of the Chicago 
Tribune, I oversaw a multi-year 
examination of criminal justice 
issues, including an investigation 
of every Illinois death row case. 
We uncovered so many wrongs 
and irregularities that the gover-

nor of Illinois — who did read the 
Tribune — declared a moratorium 
on executions and then a dra-
matic decision to shut down death 
row. Our editorials about this won 
a Pulitzer Prize. It’s not a stretch 
for me to look at that work and 
see the shadow of college news-
paper editors who lacked the full 
skill and influence to dismantle 
the nation’s capital punishment 
apparatus, but who were learn-
ing and honoring the promise of 
journalism, even if only in a dress 
rehearsal.

CALFAS: The amount of time 

I’ve spent examining potential 
legal issues, holding a debate over 
whether or not we should pursue a 
story, or carefully editing a 3,000-
word investigative story line by 
line for 16 hours in the newsroom 
on Tuesday is much larger than I 
ever imagined. What’s interest-
ing is that while we certainly do 
feel working at the Daily seems 
like a dress rehearsal, we’ve real-
ized that what we do can have 
the same impact on people the 
way stories from a professional 
news source can. Several Univer-
sity policies have changed due to 
investigations and stories from 
the Daily during my three years 
here so far. Perhaps because we 
can have a broader audience now 

because of the Internet and social 
media. I wonder: What would 
have been different about your 
time at the Daily if stories could 
be easily published for a global 
audience then as they can be now?

LIPINSKI: 
I’m 
guessing 

everything 
except 
our 
jour-

nalistic values and the insane 
workdays, while maintaining, I 
suspect, a predominant focus on 
University news. I envy you hav-
ing the tools you have now. I know 
the Daily faces the same business 
model challenges vexing all leg-
acy print publications, and those 
are serious. I didn’t file my stories 

on a computer until I went off to 
intern at the Miami Herald the 
summer following my junior year, 
and I returned to the Daily, where 
we still wrote on typewriters and 
were just making the transition 
from hot to cold type. (A prized 
possession: the lead Daily logo we 
used to print the last hot type edi-
tion.) But you have a core audience 
on campus that can adapt to new 
technologies and a staff of digital 
natives who are fluent in the new 
media forms. Will there be a print 
paper at the next reunion? How 
does the Daily exploit all of the

Student writers 
arrested while 

trying to interview 

Castro in Cuba

By WILL GREENBERG

Daily News Editor

A college newspaper is sup-

posed to be a place where young 
journalists take risks and learn 
through their successes and fail-
ures. At The Michigan Daily, 
plenty of writers have taken huge 
swings and had major success, 
including covering the desegre-
gation of schools in Little Rock, 
Ark. and interviewing Mahatma 
Gandhi.

But for Bart Huthwaite and 

Jim 
Elsman, 
their 
reporting 

adventure would land them in jail 
— in Cuba — for trying to inter-
view Fidel Castro.

The two were students at the 

University and reporters at the 
Daily in the late 1950s. While on 
campus, Huthwaite said they met 
a couple of Cuban students on 
campus who knew Castro, who at 
the time was hiding in the moun-
tains, on the cusp of taking power 
from Fulgencio Batista.

Huthwaite and Elsman’s trip 

was just one assignment from a 
noteworthy list of Daily off-cam-
pus reporting trips. While the 
Daily’s audience is mostly Uni-
versity students, the news section 
has often looked for opportunities 
to do first-hand reporting on his-
toric national and international 
news.

Over the years, Daily reporters 

have been on the scene for events 
across the state of Michigan, 
covering the governor, reporting 
from the Supreme Court in Wash-
ington, D.C. — wherever there’s 
an opportunity to write about 
something meaningful to stu-

dents without blowing the travel 
budget.

For Huthwaite, getting an 

interview with Castro — who was 
popular among students — would 
offer first-hand perspective for 
people back home.

“I figured well heck, it’d be 

great to interview him in the 
mountains and see what he’s all 
about,” he said in an interview 
with the Daily.

Huthwaite, 
who 
graduated 

from the University in 1960 and 
worked for the Daily’s news sec-
tion, started out as a night report-
er watching the police blotter. No 
longer in journalism, Huthwaite 
now lives on Mackinac Island.

As a student, Huthwaite said 

he usually travelled to Florida for 
spring break, and said a trip to 
Cuba by way of Florida wouldn’t 
be too difficult. So, with a con-
tact set up who would bring him 
to Castro, Huthwaite set out with 
Elsman to Cuba for his junior year 
Spring Break.

But Huthwaite and Elsman 

weren’t able to complete their 
assignment — they were arrested 
soon after arriving at their hotel 
in Santiago de Cuba.

“Unfortunately word got out 

(that we were there) and so Batis-
ta sent his boys over to pound 
on our door in the middle of the 
night, put us in a Jeep and take us 
up to (Moncada) barracks,” Huth-
waite said, adding that the prison 
they were held in also held rebels 
against the Cuban government, 
some of whom were executed 
while Huthwaite and Elsman 
were there.

“There was gunshots going off 

and such,” he said.

The pair would spend several 

days in the jail until a New York 
Times reporter, who was also in 
Cuba to interview Castro, secured 
their release through the U.S. 
Embassy.

When students returned to 

school after the break, the front 
page of the Daily read: “Two 
Daily Reporters Jailed in Strife-
Torn Cuba.”

“Finally after 12 hours in the 

90-degree heat of the cell, we 
started to sing the ‘Star Spangled 
Banner.’ A machinegun-bearing 
guard ordered us to be quiet or he 
would ‘separate us,’ ” the article 
read, giving a first-hand account 
of their experience.

“It’s one of the primary things 

in my youth because the people 
who were there, whether it was a 
guy like Tom Hayden or any other 
guy, it was always a wonderful 
place of free-thinking,” he said.

“Our job was always to find, 

cultivate your own stories.”

In more recent years, Daily 

news reporters have taken trips to 
cover political events — and have 
had much better luck staying out 
of Cuban jails.

Bethany Biron, who was the 

Daily’s managing news editor 
in 2012, said she tried to give 
as many people as possible the 
chance to cover major off-cam-
pus events. While running the 
section, Daily reporters were on 
the scene at the Iowa Caucuses, 
President Obama’s second victory 
watch party and other political 
events around Michigan.

While 
Biron 
acknowledged 

that stories written remotely are 
often still well reported, she said 
it adds to the Daily’s credibility 
and quality when reporters are 
actually on the scene.

“Being there at the event kind 

of gives these events more color 
and more of a true taste of what’s 
going on,” she said. “When you’re 
actually there, there’s just a larger 
level of detail that you can include 
that really brings the reader in in 
a different way.”

News Editor at the Daily in 2012,

mark moments of 

Daily change 

By SAM GRINGLAS

Managing News Editor

There was a joke staffers at 

The Michigan Daily told often 
in the 1980s.

How many Daily editors does 

it take to change a lightbulb?

“The answer was three,” said 

Joe Kraus, the opinion page edi-
tor in 1985. “Two to change it, 
and one to talk about how great 
the old one was.”

On the surface, the joke seems 

silly. (Kraus says lightbulb jokes 
were pretty popular back then.) 
But in many ways, the dig encap-
sulates a dynamic every genera-
tion of Daily editors consider.

The Daily not only must 

adapt in a field that’s changing 
at an incredibly rapid pace, but 
also must do it with 125 years 
of sepia-colored bound volumes 
staring down from the confer-
ence room shelves. That chal-
lenge is as relevant today as it 
was in 1985, when Daily edi-
tors voted to stop charging for 
the paper, or in the mid-1990s, 
when the Daily’s website carried 
breaking coverage for the first 
time.

Ann Marie Lipinski, a former 

Daily co-editor in chief who 
now curates Harvard Univer-
sity’s Nieman Foundation for 
Journalism, said most college 
newsrooms are too conservative 
when it comes to change, and 
that was likely true during her 
time as editor.

“I love Daily history, but 

we’ve sometimes been slaves 
to it, worrying too much about 
what predecessors will think,” 

she wrote in an e-mail.

When Lipinski and Jim Tobin 

became co-editors in chief, they 
sent a letter to recent editors. 
Cheryl Pilate, co-editor in chief 
of the paper two years before, 
responded with the following 
advice:

“You’re only editor of The 

Daily for one short year. So don’t 
waste your time shilly-shallying 
around and muttering about tra-
dition. Try any creative thing 
that pops into your head. In most 
cases, the only thing you can 
really ruin is one day’s paper.”

Neil Chase, a digital media 

consultant and chair of the 
Board of Student Publications 
who was the Daily’s editor in 
chief in 1985, said change is 
often the product of tough con-
versations.

That was the case in the win-

ter of 1985, when the Daily’s edi-
tors voted to initiate free-drop, 
or offering the paper at no cost 
from pick-up locations across 
campus. Until then, a Daily staff-
er would canvas the dorms the 
first week of classes, hawking 
subscription cards. Early every 
morning, local seventh graders 
picked up the papers and deliv-
ered them all over town with 
Michigan Daily bags slung over 

their shoulders.

The move was controversial, 

and Chase recalls that the final 
meeting on the topic elicited the 
kind of intensity characteristic 
of an all-staff election.

“You’re thinking, ‘I’m going 

to create this thing and you’re 
going to throw it in a pile, and 
somebody’s going to pick it up 
and read it and throw it back 
down, or they’re going to be 
blowing all over campus.’ It just 
felt like it’s cheapening the prod-
uct,” Chase said. “We thought 
we were creating something 
valuable, and we’re being told 
the new cover price for this 
product is now zero.”

But circulation was down, 

and free-drop would allow the 
paper to attract more advertis-
ing dollars. At this time, the 
Daily also began printing five 
days per week, instead of the 
traditional six.

“It’s exactly the situation that 

we’re in today,” Chase said. “The 
paper is doing well, it is not on the 
brink of any kind of disaster by any 
means, but revenue is way down.”

In early 2015, members of 

the Daily’s Management Desk 
adopted an innovation report, 
which detailed these shifts and

Tree Town’s stylish history

A look back at 
Ann Arbor’s 
20th-century 

fashion

By CAROLINE FILIPS

Daily Arts Writer

With locals defined by their 

trademark insouciance and a 
student 
population 
primarily 

invested in its studies, fashion has 
never been on the average Ann 
Arborite’s radar.

By simply surveying the streets 

of Ann Arbor, the correct decade 
is indeterminate, with street style 
ranging from those who just can’t 
get rid of their perms to those imi-
tating ’50s sensibility. Though a 
sizeable coterie of sartorial savants 
has sauntered through the Diag for 
nearly two centuries, truly fashion-
able ensembles remain a strikingly 
rare sight. Ultimately, University 
students past and present gravitate 
toward quintessential college garb 
that transcends the ages — some 
variation of pants, tees, sweats, 
sneakers and an endless cocoon of 
layers during the somewhat miser-
able days of winter, rendered toler-
able by the rare and precious snow 
days.

Though college permits those 

enrolled to experiment academi-
cally and socially, it also lends stu-
dents an opportunity to define their 
own style. From the most transient 
of trends to classic wardrobe main-
stays, it’s all been seen on campus. 
However, the student population of 
each decade seems to retain an over-
arching commonality in dressing. 
Without peeking at the date, photos 
of University women from the ’40s 
are evidenced by their penny loafers 
and angora sweaters, while those of 
the ’90s are easily spotted by their 
sheer stylish irreverence. Though 
University of Michigan style has 
never quite been that of the runway 
scene, it now seems a close reality 
while perusing the clothing racks 
of Bivouac’s women’s fashion sec-
tion or poring over the pages of the 
student-run SHEI Magazine.

With the obvious constraints 

of time limiting this chronicle of 
University fashion — namely late 
alumni unable to share their com-
mentary — in collaboration with a 
crop of fashionably inclined alumni, 
this piece serves as a comprehen-
sive examination of student fash-
ions as far back as the late ’30s and 
as current as the now. 

Late 1930s to Early 1940s 
Student 
Lynne 
Ford’s 
“On 

the Clothesline” column for The 
Michigan Daily chronicled the 
trends of the ’40s — with her content 
ranging from her partiality for 
cinched waists to critical apropros 
of swimsuit trends. Ads from the 
late, beloved Metro-Detroit retailer 
Jacobson’s for women’s sportswear 
were 
the 
Daily’s 
primary 

advertisements.

From 1939 to 1941, Jean Grillins 

might as well have attended the 
University — she dated and eventu-
ally married student Harvey Gril-
lins, with whom she spent nearly 
every weekend on campus, always 
making a stop at The Marilyn Shop 
during its heyday. She attended 
her then-boyfriend’s formal date 
parties, mesmerized by women’s 
elegant long gowns, full skirts and 
bobby socks along with men’s for-
mal tuxedos.

“They didn’t wear flats, I can tell 

you that,” Grillins recalled. “But, 
they did dress up.”

Penny loafers, blazers, angora 

sweaters and long skirts were fash-
ion markers of the era, as was the 
social calendar centered around 
J-hop dances complete with “dance 
cards” denoting who one was fated 
to dance with next.

1950s

Though a member of the gradu-

ating class of ’63, Carren Sandall 
had a keen eye for style long before 
and after her collegiate years. 
Immediately following her academ-
ic career, Sandall modeled in New 
York City and emerged as a syndi-
cated style columnist for The Ann 
Arbor News when she returned 
home to Ann Arbor. She continued 
to bridge the gap between the local 
community and the fashion world 
when she created her own course 
at Washtenaw Community College 
called “The Art of Fashion,” which 
accelerated her personal studies of 
fashion’s historical context.

“Prior to the ’50s, Paris and 

London dictated fashion,” she said. 
“Then during the late ’50s, the 

youth started making a difference.” 

When cities like New York 

emerged as fashion capitals, the 
styles that trickled down into most 
closets were heavily influenced by 
the glamorous cinematic styles of 
Audrey Hepburn films.

“You might take an element of 

film and put it in your wardrobe,” 
she said. “Hepburn heavily influ-
enced the rise of capri pants.”

1960s

“We dressed,” said Joan Abra-

ham, University graduate of 1966 
and current adjunct professor at 
Parsons School of Design in NYC.

Translation: there was a certain 

formality to the arrangement 

of ’60s garments. An unofficial 
uniform of immaculate polish was 
often seen on campus — skirts, 
knee socks, penny loafers and 
crewneck sweaters.

“Everything 
was 
very 

preppy,” 
Abraham 
said. 

“Everybody was very serious 
and we all looked alike.”

Abraham recalled that informal 

ensembles were seen only once 
weekly — casual Fridays were 
celebrated as a day permitting blue 
jeans, yet Abraham doesn’t recall a 
University-wide dress code in place.

Prior to the counterculture 

movements of the decade, Abraham 
spoke on behalf of her era’s 
University women, noting the stark 
contrast to today’s feminist ideals 
— she believed being a wife and a 
mother was her imminent future. 
Yet as the ’60s unfolded, Abraham 
and her counterparts realized their 
power as educated women and 
sought brighter futures than their 
suburban housewife predecessors. 
Carefree, 
bohemian-influenced 

styles reflected the sociopolitical 
turn and continued through the rise 
of the ’70s.

1970s

The ’70s dressing on campus 

was partly disco and quasi-rogue, 
as guys and girls alike were often 
sporting fringe on nearly every 
garment and accessory, along with 
bellbottoms and distressed denim.

Carren Landau, University grad-

uate of ’77, recalls rocking a primar-
ily peasant-inspired wardrobe.

“I wore a lot of Frye Boots, long 

jean skirts and pea coats that were 
almost floor length,” she said.

Length and volume, of flared 

pants, hairstyle or women’s skirts, 
were markers of the era. 

Students of the era even incor-

porated anti-war buttons into their 

ensembles, as they protested the 
prolonged Vietnam War. Photos 
found in the Bentley Historical 
Library on North Campus show-
case a University woman and her 
picket sign, sporting a sort of activ-
ist-chic hippie garb — a denim shirt 
accessorized with peace sign but-
tons, as she stands tall and proud in 
her extremely flared jeans.

Late 1980s to Early 1990s 

“The least fashionable I ever was 

was in Ann Arbor, no question,” 
said Marly Graubard, current exec-
utive director of fashion and beauty 
at W Magazine and 1990 alum.

Graubard stressed the era’s gen-

eral disregard for fashion, main-
taining the typical styles were those 
heavily influenced by the years’ 
music, art and film.

“Our hair was big, we had tons 

of makeup on and I think we 
dressed kind of like preppy meets 
grungy meets college campus 
… it was all about the Michigan 
clothes,” she said.

Scant shopping options on Main 

Street left students like Graubard 
either the option of Bivouac — 
where she recalled her first expo-
sure to Lululemon athletic gear 
— or weekend retreats to the retail 
havens like Somerset Collection in 
Troy, Mich. or downtown Birming-
ham, Mich. 

The period was marked by the 

common garb of Levi’s, namely 
those of the loose and ripped vari-
eties, plaid shirts and rugged boots.

“It was sort of like anti-fashion, 

there was that sort of hippy con-
tingence, sweaters and jeans,” 
Graubard said. “It was pretty 
Midwestern.”

Early 2000s

With the advent of the Inter-

net, immediacy and clothing 
slowly 
became 
synonymous. 

The outside realm of retail was 
becoming extremely brand-ori-
ented, which trickled down into 
the campus scene.

Ashley-Brooke Sandall, 2003 

graduate and current senior man-
ager of strategic partnerships for 
the Council of Fashion Designers 
of America, recalled the prepon-
derance of premium denim on 
campus, along with the overall 
utilitarian ways of dressing — 
jeans, sweaters and T-shirts.

“My friends’ style influenced me 

the most,” she said. “Then, it was 
the trends that were so exciting. 
We would read Vogue magazine.”

Along with the importance of 

brands, trends such as chunky, 
chain-link Tiffany & Co. necklac-
es and charm bracelets were the 
must-have accessories. Though a 
rather trend-centric time, struc-
turing one’s individual style was 
gradually becoming the norm.

 ***
Clothing 
existed 
as 
a 

primordial need of the masses 
long 
before 
the 
University’s 

founding, 
and 
continues 
to 

maintain its essentialism. Fashion 
at its best serves as a solace from 
a world of woes, a bubble outside 
of day-to-day routines, somewhat 
similar to the four-year journey of 
an undergraduate education — a 
window of time partially closed 
off from the frivolity of youth, just 
opening to the horrifying realities 
of adulthood (looking at you, 
taxes). And though Ann Arbor has 
never been regarded as a fashion 
capital, at the very least, one is 
sure to source inspiration from 
the eccentricity so essential to this 
beloved college town.

Daily Arts: 

A retrospective

By MATT BARNAUSKAS

Daily Arts Writer

Some may say that 1969 was the 

year of the Apollo 11 moon land-
ing, but at The Michigan Daily, an 
even more momentous occasion 
was about to take place: the forma-
tion of the Arts section. While the 
Daily covered the arts in the years 
prior to 1969, it wasn’t until late 
August of that year that the section 
was formally listed on the Editori-
al Board, with Leslie Wayne as the 
section’s first editor.

Arts coverage began with a 

diverse range of topics — a tradi-
tion that continues today. 

Reviews of records like B.B. 

King’s 1969 effort Live and Well, 
a recording writer Bert Stratton 
claimed “is the equal of any other 
electrical guitar recording and is 
unquestionably the best of B. B. 
King,” along with attention to clas-
sical and other popular music, like 
Pink Floyd’s show at the Hill Audi-
torium in October 1971, allowed 
the young section to cast a wide 
net.

Film commentary was pres-

ent in these early years with Arts 
as well, with some of the section’s 
earliest critics offering their opin-
ions on films that would become 
cornerstones of cinema.

Film critic Bruce Shlain assert-

ed in 1972 that “director Francis 
Ford Coppola has flipped ‘the 
gangster movie’ on its ear. To say 
‘The Godfather’ is merely better 
than the gangland-oriented mov-
ies which precede it, would hardly 
touch upon its uniqueness.”

Closing out the ’70s, Arts con-

tinued its attendance of live music 
including some of the decade’s big-
gest acts. Writer Mike Taylor went 
to three separate Bruce Spring-
steen 
performances 
over 
the 

course of a couple weeks in 1978, 
while Dennis Harvey reviewed 
Fleetwood Mac’s performance at 
Crisler Arena. In his review, Har-
vey wrote, “Admittedly, the Mac is 
neither one of the best or the most 
original of 1970s bands … But their 
finest songs capture a feel of silky 
folk-pop-rock catchiness that’s 
effortlessly appealing.”

Into the ’80s, Arts further grew 

with significant additions to the 
section’s leadership and coverage.

In 1985, the year John Hughes’s 

“The Breakfast Club” — which 
the Daily said was a “flawed but 
still strangely compelling film” 
— released in theaters, the Arts 
section began to expand with the 
introduction of associate editors 
and beats (areas focusing on a par-
ticular aspect of the arts). The ini-
tial beats — movies, music, books 
and theatre — have developed and 
shifted in the 30 years since their 
beginnings with additions like 
TV/new media in 1997 and style 
in 2014. Meanwhile certain beats, 
including books and theatre, have 
exited or merged into new beats, 
notably community culture.

Another introduction in the 

early ’80s was “The Weekend,” 
a weekly arts and culture insert 
that aimed at prepping the Uni-
versity’s students for their brief 
reprieve from the school week 
with “The List,” a collection of 
upcoming campus cinema, parties 
and shows. Also inside were fea-
tures on culture, style and inter-
views with random students over 

the phone. Amusingly, on Jan. 10, 
2002 there was not one but two 
pieces about the mullet in “The 
Weekend.” 

The rise in prominence of tele-

vision and cable TV during the 
decade led to Tony Sibler writing, 
“Throughout this entire coun-
try, our only common language 
is television. But it is much, much 
more than a common language. 
It is our pillow each night to shed 
tears into. It is our punching bag 
to strike. It is our dreamworld to 
escape to and our unattractive 
reality to come back to.”

This fascination with other 

forms of media would carry into 
the ’90s with television coverage 
beginning 
intermittently 
with 

“Turn on the Tube” and becom-
ing more consistent as the decade 
went on.

The Arts section and the media 

consuming culture as a whole 
agreed with Podoisky, as DVDs 
replaced VHS. Arts began review-
ing DVD releases, not just on the 
quality of films but the disc’s fea-
tures as well. This led to some 
eyebrow-raising antics, exempli-
fied by Bob Hunt’s January 2005 
24-hour binge of the third season 
of “24.”

These advances led to the 

2000s, where “The Lord of the 
Rings” trilogy garnered three 
perfect, five-star ratings from the 
Daily.

Where 
Hussain 
Rahim 

reviewed Kanye West’s debut 
album, The College Dropout. 
On the rapper who would later 
become notorious for his per-
cieved arrogance, Hussain wrote, 
“He’s not trying to scare you with 
his prison record or tell you he’s 
the best rapper ever. He knows 
he’s not.”

Where “Lost” premiered and 

took viewers, “On a horrifying 
thrill ride that is unlike anything 
on television today,” according to 
writer Doug Wernert.

On Sept. 15, 2005, “The Week-

end” magazine gave way to “The 
Statement.” To further fill in the 
absence, the pilot issue of “The 
B-Side” launched on April 12, 
2006, then-Managing Arts Editor 
Jeffrey Bloomer describing it as “a 
new features section that will give 
us a chance to write about things 
that don’t usually fit on our page. 
It’s a work in progress, but in the 
fall, you can expect to see it week-
ly, and maybe — if we can find the 
money, that is — even in color.”

With the title “The Sun Also 

Rises,” the premiere issue specu-
lated about the coming summer’s 
entertainment offerings, includ-
ing “Superman Returns” and 
Gnarls Barkley’s St. Elsewhere, 
and analyzed the legal quandary 
a burgeoning YouTube faced with 
copyright issues. Since then, “The 
B-Side” has turned its eyes to the 
local arts scene with extended 
pieces and profiles on various 
artists, organizations and events 
within and around Ann Arbor 
— and yes, Jeffrey, it’s printed in 
color.

Today, the Arts section, run by 

Co-Managing Arts Editors, LSA 
seniors Adam DePollo and Chloe 
Gilke, continues to embrace the 
variety of coverage and respond to 
constantly shifting entertainment 
media that have been present since 
the section first began in 1969.

One Hundred Twenty-Fifth Anniversary

An illustrious literary history at the ‘U’

Ann Arbor writing 

community 

continues to grow

By HAILEY MIDDLEBROOK

Daily Arts Writer

Last January, on one of those 

frozen nights where the coffee 
shop windows fog up too much to 
see in from the outside, I journeyed 
across campus to a cozy bookshop 
called Literati. The store, still in its 
infancy, opened by Mike and Hil-
ary Gustafson in 2013, is a beacon of 
literary light for Ann Arborites and 
college students alike: a small but 
rich collection of books, spread on 
repurposed shelves, sided by an old 
typewriter on which visitors leave 
their own words behind.

The store’s second level hous-

es The Espresso Bar, a clinking 
counter that keeps a running tab 
of guests’ coffee. The room, light 
and airy by day, becomes dim and 
smoky by night; particularly that 
night, as dozens of writers and bib-
liophiles tucked in to hear Rebecca 
Scherm, recent MFA graduate from 
the University’s Helen Zell Writ-
ers’ Program, read from her debut 
novel “Unbecoming.” The reading 
was the first of a country-wide tour; 
it was fittingly in an Ann Arbor cof-
fee shop, much like those where she 
had first typed her story. I squeezed 
into a corner and watched Scherm 
as she watched us, her eyes welling 
up in tears.

“This is just so weird,” Scherm 

said. “All of you here. Wow. Thank 
you, all of you. I wouldn’t have this 
book without you.”

Her wavering voice clarified as 

she began to read. The room grew 
silent save for Grace, living under-
cover in a Paris antique shop, run-
ning from her dark past. Professors, 
peers and I listened, enrapt, cof-
fee spitting in the corner and the 
typewriter humming below. Words 
were alive here.

Rebecca Scherm is not the first, 

nor will she be the last, brilliant 
writer to come through the Uni-
versity. In the 1920s, Betty Smith 
moved from Brooklyn, N.Y., to Ann 
Arbor for her then-husband to pur-
sue a law degree. Though she hadn’t 
finished high school, Smith enrolled 
in University classes; under the 
guidance of Prof. Kenneth Thorpe 
Rowe, she mastered her skills in 
writing and drama, winning the 
Avery Hopwood Award for Drama 
in 1931. A little over a decade later, 
in 1943, Smith published her inter-
national bestseller “A Tree Grows in 
Brooklyn,” drawing from her own 
childhood experiences.

During his tenure at the Uni-

versity, Prof. Rowe also taught two 
of the biggest names in literature: 
playwright Arthur Miller, class of 
1938 and a Michigan Daily alum; 
and poet and art critic Frank 
O’Hara, class of 1951. Like Smith, 
Miller also grew up as a poor 
Brooklynite, delivering bread in the 
mornings to pay for college tuition. 
Miller thrived as a journalism major 
at the University, but his playwrit-
ing talent prompted his switch to an 
English major. In 1936 he won the 
Hopwood Award for his play “No 
Villain,” then received the award 
again in 1937 for “Honors at Dawn.” 
Miller went on to become a Broad-
way legend — his plays “Death of a 
Salesman,” “All My Sons” and “The 
Crucible” exploding onstage — and 

a tabloid star, with his rocky mar-
riage to actress Marilyn Monroe. 
Later in life, Miller retained his 
alma mater ties, establishing the 
Arthur Miller scholarship award 
for talented young writers at the 
University.

While Miller’s plays flashed on 

Broadway, Frank O’Hara honed 
his poetry skills as a graduate stu-
dent at the University, winning 
the Hopwood Poetry Award for “A 
Byzantine Place: 50 Poems and a 
Noh Play” in 1951. After receiving 
his MFA in English, O’Hara moved 
to New York City, where he became 
a curator at the Modern Museum 
of Art and established himself as a 
poet and critic. An unconventional 
writer, O’Hara believed that poet-
ry should be written solely in the 
moment — scribbled on the subway, 
or in a room full of people — and 
his method spurred the poetry col-
lections “Oranges: 12 Pastorals,” 
“Meditations in an Emergency” and 
“Lunch Poems.”

O’Hara’s strong impact on the 

NYC art scene reverberates today. 
Season two of AMC’s “Mad Men,” 
about high-pressure advertising 
agencies in the 1960s, heavily refer-
enced O’Hara’s poetry. The show’s 
final episode, appropriately named 
“Meditations in an Emergency,” 
shows protagonist Don Draper find-
ing a copy of O’Hara’s book.

While many students meditated 

on poetry and novels, others found 
their niche in journalism. Neal 
Gabler, who graduated summa cum 
laude in 1971, has worn nearly every 
hat in the writing world: His col-
umns have been in The New York 
Times, Vogue and Esquire; he has 
published four books, winning the 
USA Today Biography of the Year 

for “Walt Disney: The Triumph of 
the American Imagination”; he has 
been broadcasted on the “Today” 
show and “Good Morning Ameri-
ca.” Today, he’s a Senior Fellow at 
University of Southern California’s 
Norman Lear Center and teaches 
graduate courses at State University 
of New York Stony Brook, covering 
a range of topics from biography to 
film criticism.

Gabler has also taught at the 

University in the past, receiving the 
Outstanding Teaching Award from 
the University in 1978. He had close 
ties to the Screen Arts and Cultures 
department as a student and teacher 
— especially with Hugh Cohen, cur-
rent SAC professor and his former 
mentor, who invited Gabler to give 
a guest lecture on film criticism this 
past April. In his speech, Gabler 
reminisced about his years as a 
film critic for The Michigan Daily, 
where he famously wrote more 
column inches than anyone in the 
paper’s history.

Outstanding 
mentors 
and 

professors are crucial in cultivating 
creativity. Prof. Rowe inspired 
Smith, 
Miller 
and 
O’Hara, 

among 
others; 
Prof. 
Cohen 

piqued Gabler’s interest in film. 
Naturally, University professors, 
many who return to teach after 
receiving University degrees, are 
accomplished writers themselves. 
Laura Kasischke, a 1987 graduate 
of the Zell Writers’ Program and a 
current professor at the University, 
has published eight collections of 
poetry and nine novels.

“Ann Arbor has really become 

an active writing community — 
the Zell reading series, and now 
Literati, and the many writers who 
live here have put us on the map,” 

Kasischke said, about what draws 
writers to the University. “But, even 
when I started school here in the 
’80s, there was an astonishing writ-
ing community.

“Ann Arbor isn’t a large place, but 

the University obviously attracts 
people from far and wide who 
write,” she continued. 

Among many awards, Kasischke 

won the National Book Critics 
Circle Award in 2012 for “Space, 
In Chains,” a poetry collection 
with an underlying theme of grief, 
presented through her raw and 
resonant imagery. Kasischke’s fic-
tion explores dark topics like global 
pandemics and school shootings, 
spun in the same startling realness 
as her poetry. “The Life Before Her 
Eyes,” about a survivor from a Col-
umbine-like school shooting, was 
adapted into a film starring Uma 
Thurman in 2007. 

When discussing dark and 

twisted themes in novels, Megan 
Abbott’s name also undoubtedly 
arises. Abbott grew up outside of 
Detroit and graduated from the 
University with an English degree 
in 1993, then went on to pursue a 
Ph.D. in English and American lit-
erature at New York University.

Inspired by the noir writings 

of Joan Didion and female crime 
fiction, Abbott edited “A Hell of a 
Woman,” an anthology of female 
crime fiction. She also wrote “The 
Street Was Mine: White Masculin-
ity in Hardboiled Fiction and Film 
Noir” and seven fiction novels. 
Her 2012 novel “Dare Me,” about 
a sinister crime covered up by a 
high school cheerleading squad, 
as well as her latest novel “The 
Fever,” about a sudden sickness 
that sweeps through a high school 

clique, are both being adapted 
into TV shows for HBO and MTV, 
respectively.

“It wasn’t until I started taking 

classes in the (University’s) English 
Department that I really learned 
how to write at all,” Abbott replied 
when asked in an e-mail interview.

She continued, “And workshops, 

especially the one I took with the 
brilliant and kind Keith Taylor (a 
current English professor), offered 
me my first true experience of cre-
ative writing, of burrowing into the 
dark corners of one’s own head.” 

Abbott also attributes her writ-

ing success to her time spent at 
The Michigan Daily. “Working on 
the (Daily) Arts staff filled my last 
12 months at Michigan,” she said. 
“I learned how to write book and 
movie reviews; how to be a rigor-
ous editor of my own work and 
that of others. It was the first time 
in my life that I was surrounded 
by people for whom words mat-
tered so much, story mattered so 
much.”

Every University alum brings a 

different story to campus. It’s here 
that those stories are shared and 
fleshed out, where interests take 
root and relationships flourish. 
Even when they leave Michigan, 
writers’ words remain, spoken in 
bookshops on winter nights and 
bound in volumes in the Avery 
Hopwood room of Angell Hall. 
They’re read in undergraduate 
English classes, by young students 
who may someday cast their own 
stories into the world. 

“Every year, I find so much talent 

in both the undergrad and gradu-
ate classrooms that it seems like it 
should run out someday,” Kasischke 
said. “But it doesn’t.”

Editor’s Note: As The Michigan 

Daily celebrates its 125th anniversary, 
take a look at another chapter of 
history — that of The Michigan 
Theater.

“To go where so many had gone 

before.” I can’t tell if that’s a roman-
tic sentiment or just how I feel about 
going into a public bathroom. After 
all, everyone’s been everywhere, or 
at least walked everywhere.

So why did I care so much when 

I stepped into the Michigan The-
ater for the thousandth time to 
see another new indie movie with 
another awesome Kristen Wiig per-
formance and buy another Coke, 
another ticket, another Screen-
ing Room seat? The theater is Ann 
Arbor’s cultural center, sure, but 
those are just words. Why care?

Here’s why. In another world, the 

Michigan Theater might’ve been a 
food court. Really. It’s a true story. 
And Henry Aldridge — author of 
“The Michigan Theater” and head 
organist at the theater — had time to 
tell us the whole thing.

“It was built as a movie palace 

and opened in January 1928 with 
a live show and a feature film,” 
Aldridge said. “It had a resident 
13-piece orchestra and, of course, 
the beautiful Barton pipe organ. 
The Michigan ran silent films until 
June 1929 when it switched to talk-
ing films.”

Talking films led to a rapid 

decline in live performances at the 
Michigan and across the country. 
Meanwhile, cinemas became the 
sole proprietor of the cultural and 
commercial 
phenomena: 
talk-

ies. According to Russ Collins, 

executive director and CEO of 
the Michigan Theater and State 
Theatre, annual attendance at cin-
emas around the country reached 
upwards of 4 billion.

In an interview with The Mich-

igan Daily, Collins likened the 
growth of film to the growth of 
the Internet: At first no one had it, 
then a few people did, then every-
one did and no one could imagine 
life without films. And then they 
added talking.

“People don’t think of movie his-

tory like that,” Collins said. “They 

think of it like, ‘Well there was the 
silent era which was like pre-history 
and who gives a shit? It was all dino-
saurs and that kind of crap, and it 
doesn’t have anything to do with 
what we do now.” 

The Michigan found similar 

success to other cinemas. Until the 
1950s, when television surpassed 
film as the principal means of 
entertainment and every theater 
hurt. To combat declining audience 
numbers, the theater’s ownership 
authorized drastic renovations to 
the theater space.

Over the next two decades 

though, the Michigan’s new “mod-
ernized” appearance wouldn’t be 
enough to solidify its place in Ann 
Arbor, and, faced with stiff com-
petition, Butterfield made plans to 
close the theater in 1979 and turn 
the space into a food court. But, 
of course, this was not to be, not if 
Henry Aldridge had anything to say 
about it. With 14 months advanced 
notice about the closing, Aldridge 
sought out colleagues and support-
ers of the Michigan.

“Beginning in June 1978, when 

we first heard of plans to repurpose 
the theater, I started calling and vis-
iting anyone and everyone I could 
think of to see if we could come up 
with a strategy to save the theater. I 
was politely rebuffed by most people 
who saw no need for a slightly worn 
out old movie theater.” 

Naturally, not everyone was 

enthusiastic. According to Collins, 
some Ann Arbor locals wondered 
why their town needed another 
“big theater,” in part because 
the Power Center, which opened 
in 1971, was still relatively new. 
Despite some support, it seemed 
that the Michigan might not be 
saved after all, that Aldridge’s 
efforts would ultimately be impas-
sioned but ineffective.

But then Aldridge’s friend put him 

in contact with Mayor Lou Belcher, 
and the two came up with the idea 
of establishing a 501(c)(3) corpora-
tion to purchase the theater, or in 
Aldridge’s words: “Mayor Belcher 
knew how to get things done.”

With 
Belcher’s 
know-how, 

Aldridge’s determination and the 
financial support of community 
members — specifically and espe-
cially philanthropist Margaret Tow-
sley — the Michigan was purchased. 
On Sept. 28, 1979, after being closed 
for only six weeks, the Michigan 
Theater reopened with a showing of 
the feature film “Gigi.” The adver-
tisement read, “The Michigan The-
ater’s Screen Glows Again.”

“Within days, groups such as 

the Ann Arbor Film Festival, folk 
singers, rock bands and others 
approached us about booking the 
theater. We operated the theater 
until May l980 with a handful of vol-
unteers until our first manager was 
hired,” Aldridge said.

Since the reopening, the Michi-

gan Theater has undergone a series 
of costly but crucial renovations. 
From the foyer, auditorium and 
ceiling to the addition of a screen-
ing room and offices, the Michigan 
Theater has left its “modernized” 
renovations in the ’50s, where they 
belong. According to Aldridge, “The 
Michigan looks very much like it did 
in 1928.”

Now, beyond architectural and 

interior grandeur, the theater has 
returned to its roots. It keeps busy. 
Collins is the executive director of 
the Michigan, yes, but also oper-
ates the State Theatre, the Cineto-
pia Film Festival and the Art House 
Convergence, a national conference 
for independent cinemas that the 
Michigan runs in association with 
Sundance.

In addition to films, the Michi-

gan Theater hosts live music, 
concerts, symphonies, children’s 
programs, silent movies, stand-
up, lectures, classes, Broadway 
shows and plays. The Michigan 
is the home of the Penny Stamps 

Lecture Series, the Ann Arbor 
Symphony Orchestra, the Michi-
gan Pops Orchestra and countless 
other events, from English depart-
ment cocktail parties to Law 
School graduations. To list every 
brilliant, famous person who’s 
ever performed or spoken at the 
Michigan would give my editor 
an aneurysm, so I’ll just mention 
a few: David Sedaris, B.B. King, 
Pussy Riot, Joe Jackson, Iggy Pop, 
Mike Birbiglia (my favorite) and 
many, many more. 

As I sat in Collins’s office, on his 

visitor chair — which is, obviously, a 
small director’s chair — he told me 
many things, but one in particular 
that I didn’t understand at the time, 
not fully anyway:

“The Michigan Theater is an 

interesting laboratory for studying 
how things are completely different 
and exactly the same.”

The pipe organ. The renovations. 

The movies. Live performances — 
just like 1928. As he led me to his 
office, Collins and I stopped by the 
auditorium, where some tech guys 
were turning nobs on the sound-
board, and a band tested their 
microphones. 

All I could think about was the 

theater, how it almost wasn’t there 
and then it was, and how much 
it matters to so many. To Henry 
Aldridge. To Russ Collins. To me. 
To freshmen who aren’t sure why 
there are two old cinemas right next 
to each other, but who eventually 
learn. To every theater employee 
who’s ever caught the end of “Bird-
man” right before clean-up. To so 
many who have gone before.

More than 80 years of history, 

conflict, struggles, buyouts, sales, 
constructions, renovations, plans, 
performances, losses, gains, films, 
Cokes, 20-somethings. More than 
80 years of students like me, car-
ing about our theater, our theater 
that now sits between an Elevation 
Burger and the Tropical Smoothie 
Café, that rubs shoulders with 
Graffiti Alley.

The Michigan Theater is still 

here. It’s not a food court. It’s an 
institution, an inseparable part of 
Ann Arbor’s wiring. In fact, the 
more I think about it, the more I 
think what Collins said about film 
could (should) really be about the 
Michigan:

“It didn’t exist, and then it existed 

and a few people had it. And then it 
existed and a whole bunch of people 
had it, but not everybody. And then, 
everybody thought it was really 
cool.”

This week, the Michigan The-

ater is showing “Grandma.” I 
hear it’s pretty good. Maybe I’ll go 
alone. Maybe I’ll sit in someone’s 
old usual seat, and I won’t even 
know it. And that, well, that’ll be 
really cool.

Inside 125 years of Michigan sports history

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

The 
history 
of 
Michigan 

athletics 
is 
told 
through 

moments.

People remember where they 

were when the Michigan football 
team outlasted Notre Dame 
under the lights at Michigan 
Stadium in 2013, one of the 
greatest games in Michigan 
Stadium’s storied history. They 
remember watching as the Fab 
Five rose to prominence in the 
early 
1990s, 
captivating 
the 

nation in the process. They even 
remember tragedy, like the day 
legendary football coach Bo 
Schembechler passed away on 
the eve of the historic matchup 
between No. 2 Michigan and No. 
1 Ohio State in 2006.

Bob Ufer’s radio call of John 

Wangler to Anthony Carter in 
1979 still rings through people’s 
minds. 
Photos 
of 
Charles 

Woodson’s No. 1 salute in the 
1998 Rose Bowl hang on walls 
throughout America. Desmond 
Howard’s Heisman pose during 
the 1991 Michigan-Ohio State 
game is a fixture on college 
football highlight reels even 
today.

These moments have filled the 

pages of The Michigan Daily for 

125 years now. Hundreds of Daily 
sports writers have been inside 
all the action in all that history.

Arguably, nowhere is that 

tradition more important than 
Michigan. This is a school that 
holds onto memories of past 
glory as a standard for the future. 
It cherishes the connections 
forged between teammates and 
coaches over the years. It even 
measures current success in 
relation to the past, most notably 
by comparing football coaches 
to Schembechler, the program’s 
patriarch.

Over the years, Michigan has 

laid a foundation of remarkable 
consistency. At present, three 
varsity coaches are in their 32nd 
year at the University: hockey’s 
Red Berenson, softball’s Carol 
Hutchins and women’s track and 
field’s James Henry. From 1921 
until 1988, Michigan had just 
three total Athletic Directors — 
Fielding H. Yost, Fritz Crisler 
and Don Canham. The Daily 
provided 
consistent 
coverage 

of their rise to the stature they 
occupy today.

* * *

The 
University’s 
athletic 

history predates even the Daily’s 
by 
a 
quarter-century. 
This 

year, Michigan Athletics will 
celebrate its 150th anniversary 
while the Daily celebrates its 
125th.

But the Daily has documented 

sports from its outset. It covered 
Yost’s famous “point-a-minute” 
teams in the early 1900s, back 
when a printing press below the 
newsroom was used to set type. 
A Nov. 12, 1905 story headlined 
“SUBSTITUTES 
SCORE 

FORTY POINTS ON OHIO 
STATE” details one of Yost’s 
teams’ victory.

“The 
most 

brilliant 
run 

ever seen on 
Ferry 
Field 

and the longest 
run ever made 
anywhere 
… 

was the one 
feature 
of 

yesterday’s 
game with Ohio State,” the Daily 
wrote about a long touchdown 
run by Al Barlow. “Two forty-
yard 
runs 
for 
touchdowns 

made by Garrels complete what 
was 
undoubtedly 
the 
most 

spectacular game ever seen in 
Ann Arbor.” 

Circumstances have changed 

immeasurably 
since 
then. 

Football is different, the Daily 
is different, the writing style 

is different, and the University 
is different. But the concept 
of recording the highs and 
lows of Michigan athletics has 
remained constant.

Many more stories since Yost’s 

teams have garnered much more 
attention as the media and the 
sports landscape have expanded. 
One of the highest-profile stories 
was the rise of the Fab Five and 
their success during a two-
year run from 1991 to 1993. In 
their second year together, they 

started 
the 

season ranked 
No. 1 in the 
country 
and 

took opponents 
by storm.

“It 
was 

one of those 
situations 
where 
their 

experience 

just whipped our behinds,” 
legendary Purdue coach Gene 
Keady said after the Wolverines 
beat 
his 
ninth-ranked 

Boilermakers on Jan. 8, 1993.

“I would not under any 

circumstances want to play 
Michigan again if they were 
playing like that,” said another 
legendary coach from the same 
state, Bob Knight, after his top-
ranked Hoosiers squeaked past 

Michigan a month later.

The Fab Five rolled into the 

NCAA Tournament and past 
Kentucky in the Final Four. 
“A-MAIZE-ING,” 
read 
the 

headline on the front of the 
SportsMonday section on April 
5, 1993, with a photo of Chris 
Webber embracing Jalen Rose 
after the game. 

The next day, the headline 

read “TIME TO LOSE,” with 
Leon Derricks consoling Webber 
after the star tried to call a 
timeout in the final seconds of 
the 
National 
Championship 

Game.

So it has gone for the 

Daily’s coverage of Michigan’s 
triumphs and struggles every 
day for 125 years.

* * *

The Fab Five era was a 

momentous 
period 
in 
the 

University’s history, but the 
moments 
extend 
to 
many 

different ages, sports and issues.

There have been moments 

of pride. In 1989, near the end 
of the men’s basketball season, 
Schembechler fired coach Bill 
Frieder for agreeing to become 
the head coach at Arizona State 
after the season. “A Michigan 
man will coach Michigan!” 

Schembechler said.

There have been moments of 

change. In 1934, Michigan had 
scheduled a football game at 
Georgia Tech, but the Yellow 
Jackets refused to compete if 
the Wolverines played Willis 
Ward, a black player on the 
team. Michigan forced Ward 
to stay home and traveled to 
Atlanta for the game, sparking 
outrage on campus.

There have been moments 

of redemption. In 1968, Ohio 
State routed Michigan, 50-14, 
when Buckeyes coach Woody 
Hayes opted for the two-point 
conversion late in a 48-14 game. 
He said he did it “because I 
couldn’t go for three!” The 
next year, Schembechler’s team 
stunned No. 1 Ohio State to win 
the Big Ten and make the Rose 
Bowl.

The rest of Schembechler’s 

tenure went down in history 
just like the beginning, as he 
went 194-48-5 in 21 seasons 
and served as an icon for the 
Michigan program.

Those icons are all around, 

both the presence of current 
ones and the memory of past 
ones. The Daily has always told 
their stories, and will continue 
to do so as long as there are 
stories to tell.

“A Michigan 

man will coach 

Michigan!”

Rosenberg reflects on lessons learned at Daily

By MAX BULTMAN

Daily Sports Editor

Last spring, on a particularly 

late night at the Daily, the Sept. 
12, 1994 sports section of The 
Michigan Daily was sitting on 
the table in the center in the 
conference room. Surrounded by 
bound volumes on the shelves, 
and a few on the table, the 
standalone issue stood out.

It was the oldest issue of 

the Daily the current editorial 
staff had ever seen that wasn’t 
contained by a bound volume 
or framed on the wall. But more 
thrillingly, it included a column 
from Michael Rosenberg — the 
1995 editor in chief of the Daily, 
now a senior writer at Sports 
Illustrated — on the front of the 
sports page.

Today, 
Rosenberg 
is 
one 

of the most prominent sports 
writers in the country. He has 
written for some of the top 
papers in the country, including 
The Washington Post, Chicago 
Tribune, Detroit Free Press, 
The 
Philadelphia 
Inquirer 

and The Sacramento Bee. His 
work was featured in the 2005 
edition of “The Best American 
Sports Writing,” and he has been 
featured in the Associated Press 
Sports Editors top 10 column-

writing awards multiple times.

It was especially exciting, 

then, that on the front of the 
sports page from that issue was 
an especially moving feature by 
Rosenberg 
on 
then-Michigan 

receiver Walter Smith.

Rosenberg has written several 

phenomenal stories throughout 
his 
career, 
but 
there 
was 

something about Smith’s that 
made it especially poignant.

Smith injured his knee before 

his senior season, and Rosenberg 
set out to tell his story — a 
gripping, emotional tale about 
the life he had moved away from 
but had irreversibly shaped him. 
The following passage captures 
its essence:

“ ‘I cried before every game 

last year,’ Smith says, ‘because I 
thought we were going to lose.’ 
He does not cry when his friends 
are killed. He cries when his 
football team loses, or might lose. 
People usually cry when a friend 
dies partly because it is a shock. 
When Smith’s friends die it is 
not a shock. It literally happens 
about as often as his football 
team loses.”

Rosenberg had to treat this 

story with immense care in order 
to be fair to Smith, just one of 
many traits that make his work 
so respected.

So when the Daily caught 

up 
with 
Rosenberg 
before 

Michigan’s 2015 season-opening 
football game at Utah, we asked 
about the story — in writing it, 
Rosenberg exemplified one of 
the most important lessons he 
learned during his time at the 
Daily.

“It’s not just getting your 

facts right,” Rosenberg said, “but 
(that) you’re taking the proper 
care.”

The Smith story had such 

sensitive subject matter — about 
Smith’s upbringing in Detroit 
and his resulting distrust of 
people — that it was especially 
important to be careful and 
courteous.

The Daily reached out to 

Smith to talk about the story. 
All these years later, he still has 
a copy of the piece, titled, “Self-
made man,” but he had no idea 
Rosenberg was now working at 
Sports Illustrated.

Asked what Rosenberg did 

to make him feel comfortable 
sharing such a vulnerable story, 
Smith talked about how relatable 
and understanding Rosenberg 
was with him. At the time of 
the piece, Smith had injured 
his ACL and was reeling from 
the realization he couldn’t play 
football. But Rosenberg still 

managed to connect with him, 
showing empathy and treating 
his life story with care.

“He made me feel like I wasn’t 

hurt,” Smith said. “That’s an art.”

The Daily strives to foster the 

growth of exemplary journalists 
like Rosenberg. And in order 
to grow, making mistakes is 
inevitable. Rosenberg learned 
that lesson at 420 Maynard St., 
too.

Back in 1992, New York 

Yankee 
legend 
Derek 
Jeter 

briefly attended the University. 
Back then, Jeter was just a draft 
pick out of Kalamazoo Central 
High School. He wasn’t playing 
for the Michigan baseball team, 
so he was, for all intents and 
purposes, a regular student. 
Rosenberg decided to write a 
story on him, setting up what 
became 
an 
embarrassing 

learning experience.

“I did a story on (Jeter), and 

for some reason, and to this day 
I have no idea why, I mentioned 
he played football, which he 
didn’t do,” Rosenberg said. “I 
must have, I don’t know, but 
I’m assuming I heard it from 
somebody in the newsroom, and 
being a freshman in college, I 
just didn’t check it. It wasn’t 
like I could Google it at the time 
because there was no Google. 

It’s my fault, it’s my story, but 
it’s not like I came up with it on 
my own.

“I just didn’t know what I was 

doing. I was literally 17.”

Jeter and Rosenberg ran into 

each other a few times upon 
Jeter’s trips back to campus. 
Jeter was always friendly, saying 
hello and not mentioning the 
error. Of course, that wasn’t the 
end of it.

“I found out years later that 

he was pissed about the story, 
cause his friends were giving 
him shit about it in Kalamazoo,” 
Rosenberg said. “And he should 
have been pissed! It was wrong!”

Fellow 
Daily 
alum 
Ken 

Davidoff, 
now 
a 
baseball 

columnist for the New York 
Post, eventually clued Rosenberg 
in to his mistake, leaving him 
mortified, but allowing him to 
make good on it.

After 
a 
couple 
years 
— 

Rosenberg 
doesn’t 
remember 

exactly when, only that Nick 
Swisher was on the Yankees at 
the time — he paid a visit to the 
Yankee captain at a Detroit Tigers 
game.

“I went into the Yankees 

dugout, before a Tigers game, 
of course he remembers me,” 
Rosenberg said. “He might have 
forgotten me if I had gotten the 

story right, but it’s years later, 
and I hadn’t talked to him since 
I’d heard that. And I said, ‘I just 
wanted to say I’m sorry.’ And he 
was entertained. He was like, 
‘This guy said I played football!’ ”

A friendly observer to the 

situation, 
Davidoff 
eventually 

asked Jeter about it.

Asked about the error, Jeter 

said, “It’s not the first time 
someone wrote something wrong 
about me,” to which Davidoff 
replied, “Actually, I think it was!”

In journalism, as in any field, 

errors shape a writer as much — if 
not more — than their successes. 
And while Rosenberg was already 
an established columnist by the 
time he found out about his Jeter 
mistake, he still counts it among 
the various ways the Daily helped 
him to grow.

“You just learn,” he said.
It was at the University and at 

the Daily that Rosenberg learned 
some of the most important 
lessons for a young journalist.

“Just because a story is accurate 

doesn’t mean it’s fair — especially 
if it’s their personal life,” he said. 
“If you catch a coach breaking a 
rule, that’s fair game. If a coach’s 
wife has cancer, and doesn’t want 
you to know it, it doesn’t matter if 
you know it. That’s their life. It’s 
just a story to you.”

Schefter’s career began 
with Daily experience

By MAX COHEN

Managing Sports Editor

Before he was one of the 

nation’s most prominent NFL 
reporters, Adam Schefter was 
a freshman at the University of 
Michigan looking for something 
to do with his time.

First, he tried to rush a 

fraternity, but that didn’t work 
out. Then he went to the football 
offices, looking to help out, but 
they didn’t have a job for him. 
He went to the basketball team’s 
office for the same reason, and 
they didn’t have anything for him 
to do, either.

It took three misses, but 

Schefter 
eventually 
found 

something to pour himself into: 
The Michigan Daily. It changed 
his life.

“I was always very curious 

about newspapers,” Schefter said 
in a phone interview. “I loved 
sports growing up, and that kind 
of combined two interests when I 
had no other opportunities. And it 
just led to, honestly, just a thought. 
I never, never, never imagined that 
it would turn into my vocation.”

Schefter, now an ESPN NFL 

Insider who appears on a variety 
of NFL shows on the network, 
in 
addition 
to 
frequently 

contributing to ESPN.com and 
ESPN Radio, arrived at the Daily 

as a timid freshman, one who 
was still finding his way. But 
eventually, he found a passion. 
By the time Schefter graduated 
from the University in 1989, 
he had served as the paper’s 
managing 
sports 
editor 
and 

covered Michigan hockey, men’s 
basketball and football for the 
Daily.

“It 
was 
something 
that 

captivated me and interested me 
and motivated me,” Schefter said. 
“I loved it. I was drawn to it.”

An airport conversation during 

what Schefter believes was his 
junior year helped solidify his 
career path.

He was waiting for a flight 

to cover a Michigan men’s 
basketball game in Minnesota 
when he approached Detroit 
Free Press sports writer Thomas 
George, who was on the same 
flight. In their conversation and 
the ones that followed, George 
helped convince Schefter that 
sports journalism was actually a 
viable career path.

“To me, that was something 

that was unattainable, something 
that somebody else did, not me,” 
Schefter said. “The more I talked 
to him, the more I thought, ‘Wow, 
maybe I can try this.’ ”

And 
Schefter 
did. 
After 

graduating from the University, 
Schefter earned a master’s degree 

at 
Northwestern 
University’s 

Medill School of Journalism 
before starting a newspaper 
career. He worked for the Seattle 
Post-Intelligencer, 
the 
Rocky 

Mountain News and the Denver 
Post before transitioning into 
television.

He considers the Daily to be the 

launching pad of his career, a place 
where he was able to learn about 
himself and his future profession.

“If I didn’t go to the Daily, 

I wouldn’t have done this,” 
Schefter said. “It set me on a path 
to doing what I am doing today.”

One of the experiences that 

stands out most to Schefter 
from 
his 
Daily 
career 
was 

the 
opportunity 
to 
cover 

legendary Michigan coach Bo 
Schembechler in his penultimate 
season, Schefter’s senior year.

Schembechler 
held 
court 

at Weber’s Inn in Ann Arbor 
every Monday, and Schefter 
never missed a single one. He 
loved listening to the coaching 
icon and learning from his 
experiences.

“I’d go and I’d have my best 

meal of the week, lunch on 
Monday, Weber’s Inn, and I’d get 
to listen to Bo Schembechler,” 
Schefter said. “What was better 
than that? Getting a free meal 
and getting to listen to Bo? It 
didn’t get better than that.”

Committing to objectivity
T

he relationship between Americans, 
newspapers and editorial freedom is 
a tangled mess of a story, with blood 

and ink dripping slowly 
down its winding pages. 
Evidence 
suggests 
this 

story began in 1690 when 
Benjamin Harris published 
the first and only edition of 
Publick Occurrences Both 
Forreign and Domestick, 
in the then-colonial town 
of Boston. The publication 
was shut down by British 
authorities a mere four days 
after its initial installment 
for failing to obtain a pub-
lishing license from the government.

The next American newspaper wasn’t print-

ed until years later when, in 1704, the governor 
approved The Boston News-Letter, which was 
heavily subsidized and censored by the Brit-
ish government. Successive colonial papers 
received the same treatment, with several edi-
tors and publishers jailed when authorities did 
not agree with their views. 

Of course, that all changed in 1765 when colo-

nial residents finally decided to act against the 
dictator-like presence of the British, starting a 
revolution that was heard around the world.

During that time, America’s founding fathers 

instituted the Bill of Rights, with the First 
Amendment reading as follows: “Congress shall 
make no law respecting an establishment of 
religion, or prohibiting the free exercise there-
of; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of 
the press; or the right of the people peaceably 
to assemble, and to petition the Government for 
a redress of grievances” (emphasis mine).

Thereafter, media in the United States was 

subject to censorship only through the lens of 
our first amendment; strict government cen-
sorship became a thing of older times or of 
other nations.

With the spirit of a free press still fresh in the 

minds of citizens, the initial staff of The Michi-
gan Daily printed its first edition on Sept. 29, 
1890. Since that day, the Daily has remained edi-
torially independent from all outside influences, 
including (and especially) the University.

But without any external influence, how do 

you decide what stories to report and how to 
frame them? And how have those people’s deci-
sions in the past affected their successors who 
make similar editorial decisions today?

The evolution of newspapers and journalism 

has come a long way. As the sensationalism that 
filled the pages of the Penny Press decreased, 
journalists began to focus more on facts and 
objectivity. During the early 19th century, so 
called “news” and “editorial commentary” were 
often mixed together within one article, giving 
readers a sense of how the writers felt about cer-
tain topics and why they felt that way. Toward 
the end of the 19th century and the beginning of 
the 20th, journalism became a prestigious career 
with a code of ethics to follow.

The first rule? Objectivity.
Today, objectivity is the goal most journal-

ists strive toward when reporting the facts to 
the public. The Society of Professional Jour-
nalists stresses objectivity and other journal-
istic ethics in its code of ethics, which is well 
known by reporters across the nation.

With the evolution of objectivity came the 

natural separation of “news” and “editorial” 
pages. News reporters were striving for objec-
tive reporting when relaying facts to the public, 
while editors from the opinion section wrote 
stories in a purposefully unobjective format. 

At the Daily, a complete separation between 

the incompatible sections didn’t happen until 
the early 1990s. In an interview with the Daily, 
David Schwartz, a former news reporter turned 
editorial page editor (February 1990-January 
1991) noted, “There was a tension during my 

first couple years of the paper between those 
of us who thought journalism should be about 
objectively reporting the news and others who 
thought there’s no such thing as being objective. 
(The idea was that) everyone has their biases, 
and we might as well own up to what our biases 
are, and have the entire paper — including the 
news section — be activist.”

During that time, all Daily staffers were 

allowed to become editorial board members, 
potentially creating a conflict of interest with 
regard to objective news reporting. Schwartz 
and several other staffers disagreed with the 
sentiment that the entire newspaper should be 
activist. Objectivity was a goal reporters around 
the globe were working toward, and the Daily 
was not about to be left behind in the world of 
journalism. Eventually, during the 1990 editor 
elections, objectivity won and activism was 
reserved solely for the Opinion section; the 
News section would stick to reporting the news 
without clear social and political biases.

With the roles of each section agreed upon, 

the Daily’s editorial page began focusing on 
issues in which they could actually create a 
lasting effect. 1995-1996 Editorial Page Edi-
tor Julie Becker said in an interview with my 
co-EPE, Derek Wolfe, “One of the things that 
we really tried to do was move away from 
talking, especially about international issues, 
but also about national and domestic, because 
not only were they not going to be solved on 
the pages of the Daily, but we were not the 
most qualified people to be writing about that 
sort of thing.”

By refocusing with a narrowed lens on 

the University community, the Opinion page 
transformed into more than just a group of 
students whining about news well beyond 
the scope of Ann Arbor. With both University 
officials and students reading our thoughts 
through a critical lens, editorials became 
wired with facts and reporting of our own. 

“It was very good for me to really have to 

defend my positions and really think about 
what my opinions were and why they were 
what they were and learn to support them 
with facts,” mentioned Becker while talking 
about what the Opinion page taught her.

I first joined the Daily’s Opinion page dur-

ing my sophomore year of college. As a newbie, 
I never quite realized how much journalistic 
skill goes into writing factually accurate and 
poignant arguments. My time as an assis-
tant editor, then senior editor, then editorial 
page editor has taught me that there’s more to 
opinion writing than just letting others know 
what you think. You have to show your audi-
ence why your ideas are the right ideas. It’s 
like writing an argumentative essay for thou-
sands of professors who are sometimes cruel 
and unjust.

And while much of the criticism toward 

the Opinion page is directed toward the Daily 
in general, the Opinion staff and editors often 
face the weight of their decisions alone.

“We don’t have a professional staff of jour-

nalists around trying to sort through that 
stuff, so we all had to do it ourselves and 
teach each other, which I think increases the 
pressure on you, the sense of consequence for 
failure, the fear that you’re doing it wrong. 
It all weighs on you really heavily,” Stephen 
Henderson, 1991-1992 editorial page editor 
and current editorial page editor of the Detroit 
Free Press, noted in an interview. 

Yet we bear the weight and continue to com-

ment on stories that our staff deem important on 
campus. The losses are remembered as lessons 
and the wins as prideful memories. It’s a constant 
struggle of reflection and analysis, but it’s a strug-
gle with which the Opinion staff will forever — 
gladly — remain entangled.

MARSH

The purpose of the Opinion page
I

n the time I’ve been on the Dai-
ly’s Opinion staff, I’ve noticed 
something: This campus has a 

lot of opinions 
and no shortage 
of people who 
want to share 
them.

It’s been that 

way for the last 
125 years, and 
that trend shows 
no sign of slow-
ing — just look at 
my e-mail inbox. 
That 
reality, 

though, has left 
the Daily’s Opinion page having to 
deal with serious questions about its 
purpose.

“Is the Daily a forum for all? Or is 

it a controlled forum?” Julie Becker, 
who was editorial page editor from 
1995-1996, asked when we spoke in 
early September. “And if it’s con-
trolled, who are we to be controlling 
it, and what are the standards by 
which we’re going to control it?”

And as Stephen Henderson, the 

editorial page editor of the Detroit 
Free Press who served as the Daily’s 
EPE from 1991-1992, told me, “It’s 
said (the Opinion page) serves two 
purposes: one is to advocate for the 
positions the institution holds and 
is trying to advance, but the other 
is to provide a place for everybody, 
and especially for opposing points of 
view, to get some air time.”

That said, I think it’s important 

to recognize what David Schwartz, 
who was EPE from 1990-1991, told 
me when I spoke with him. He men-
tioned how many issues like the 
Arab-Israeli conflict aren’t going to 
be solved on the pages of the Daily 
and effectively said the Opinion 
page, in many cases, is just a place to 
be heard.

As the current editorial page edi-

tor, I grapple with the questions and 
comments from Becker, Henderson 
and Schwartz every day. Most of the 
time, those questions are answered 
for us; we don’t have enough content 
for the day, so we run what we have. 
But other times, we have to make a 
choice. If we received two or three 
pieces on sexual assault, the BDS 
movement or wealth inequality, how 

do we reasonably pick what is fit to 
print? How do we make sure those 
opposing points of view get the page 
space they deserve? And if we have 
to pick one person’s point of view 
over another’s, does that imply the 
opinion we choose is more impor-
tant than another one?

While often times we go with the 

piece that is the most “grammati-
cally correct” or “well-written,” in 
many ways, we are ranking views, 
and that makes me uncomfortable. 
Perhaps even more uncomfortable 
than choosing individual pieces 
to publish is when we hire colum-
nists each semester. We get more 
applicants than there are spots, and 
choosing who gets to write about 
mental health or environmental 
issues or politics can be as difficult 
or more difficult than choosing 
opinions to publish from issue to 
issue.

Of course, there are also logistical 

factors that play into these decisions, 
like space on the page and the time 
we have to make these decisions. But 
the point remains the same: not all 
people and issues on campus, minus 
bigots, get the recognition they need 
or deserve.

Activism on campus comes in 

all shapes and sizes, and I’m will-
ing to bet that many, if not all, past 
EPEs desperately want the Daily to 
be a go-to space for activists to voice 
their opinions on issues they feel 
strongly about. Henderson spoke to 
this point when I talked with him in 
early September.

“That part of the job (receiving 

submissions from campus groups) 
was at least as much work and took 
as much thought as the editorial 
part of the job did, because you had 
these deeply passionate groups and 
individuals. And deeply passionate 
about very serious issues,” Hender-
son said. “The stuff that they were 
talking about … was big stuff. It 
wasn’t little things. And so there was 
a lot of pressure, I felt, to handle all 
that in a sophisticated and fair way 
at a pretty young age, when I had no 
previous experience doing it.”

I certainly feel that pressure, 

which seems to boil down to one 
question: How do you balance 
between wanting to produce a high-

quality newspaper with the best 
writers and the need to present 
diverse viewpoints? 

To me, that is a battle every opin-

ion page will fight indefinitely. I see 
it as my role as EPE to work with 
groups to meet in the middle; I want 
to get their writing to a point where 
it is acceptable for our publication. 
This takes time and effort, but it’s 
important work.

Arching over all of this, though, is 

what Schwartz said: Issues don’t get 
solved on the Opinion page. Home-
lessness in Ann Arbor was being 
written about 25 years ago, and it’s 
still an issue. Sexual assault was a 
relevant topic in the early 1990s, 
and it’s even more so now. The same 
goes for institutional racism at the 
University. The administration con-
tinuously fails to listen to students, 
and that leaves many frustrated.

As Schwartz puts it, “I think that 

the dynamic is the same between 
activist students and an adminis-
tration that is often much slower to 
adapt or to change than the students 
would like. I think that’s likely to be 
true of the U of M going back to the 
’60s and going forward from here.”

To me, what Schwartz is saying 

is all the more reason to maintain 
a vibrant, expansive opinion page. 
Though the issues themselves may 
not be solved in print, the voices 
fighting, explaining or advocating 
for these issues matter. Submitting 
a viewpoint or writing a column is 
an exclamation of the statement, “I 
am here and I matter.” Because of 
the Daily’s rather large audience, I 
feel an immense responsibility to 
give people that chance to announce 
their presence. Even though ques-
tions regarding how to do so must 
be wrestled with continuously, the 
Daily has been a place for sharing 
voices for the past 125 years, and 
will continue to serve that role in 
the future.

The Opinion page is a place to 

say that we, the students of the Uni-
versity of Michigan, care about the 
world around us and will keep fight-
ing the good fight — whatever that 
fight may be.

One Hundred Twenty-Fifth Anniversary

transformational digital opportu-
nities and stay financially viable? 
I would love to listen in on the 
conversations you all have about 
this and know how you balance 
Daily values worth preserving 
with the need to train success-
ful leaders and assure a relevant 
future for the newsroom.

CALFAS: The issue of simul-

taneously adapting to a changing 
media landscape while maintain-
ing the strong traditions and val-
ues is one of the most important 
conversations happening every 
day in our newsroom. What’s 
difficult is striking a balance 
between honoring our past and 
thinking critically about our 
future. The most memorable 
changes in the Daily’s history are 
now movements that we honor 
— so why can’t we make some 
changes ourselves and join the 
innovators of the past? Some-
thing I’ve tried to promote during 
my time as editor is the willing-
ness to try something new. As a 
college newspaper, we must take 
advantage of our unique lens we 
bring to campus and Ann Arbor 
news as students, and we have a 
responsibility to explore new and 
innovative ways to produce and 
promote our content. If someone 
has a new idea, why not try it 
out? If it doesn’t work, it doesn’t 
work, and that’s the worst thing 
that could happen. Whenever the 
topic of moving away from print 
comes up, we often look to the 
scores of bound volumes star-
ing back at us in our newsroom. 
The tradition and legacy of the 
paper is something that carries 
us to where we are now, but the 
progress and innovation that 
came before us remind us that we 
too can leave a mark within our 
own newsroom. What does the 
value of the Daily’s print publi-
cation mean for you — and, per-
haps, what’s the significance of 
its social media presence and new 
website design?

LIPINSKI: I’m unsentimen-

tal about the print Daily. A few 
years ago, the bound volume 
I had received commemorat-
ing my year as co-editor was 
destroyed in a house flood. I was 
sad at first, then calmly resigned 
when I conceded that I rarely 
looked at it and that my fierce 
attachment was to the idea of 
the Daily, the amazing people I 
learned from and the collective 
we built there. (…) But my real 
education on Maynard Street 
was so much more profound. I 
remember as a young reporter 
watching the senior editors (all 
of a year or two older than me) 
investigate an accusation of pla-
giarism, a charge that ended in 
their painful decision to dismiss 
a gifted student peer. I won’t 
forget the seriousness of their 
deliberations, and years later I 
leaned into my memory of their 
ethical stewardship when as an 
editor I was put in judgment of a 
colleague similarly charged. You 
can’t lose that in a flood and as a 
student-run teaching hospital for 
journalists, I think the Daily is 
extraordinary. (…) My own bias is 
to be more bold, though I think a 
lot of college papers are surpris-

ingly conservative about change. 
You’re right to ask, “Why not try 
it out?” and be grateful for the 
paper’s legacy but not a slave to 
it.

May I change the subject? 

Here I am, a woman who was 
Daily co-editor, talking with the 
Daily’s presiding woman editor in 
chief. That’s already two more top 
women editors than most major 
news institutions have had, and 
you and I are but two of many 
women leaders in the Daily’s 
history. We recently published a 
lengthy story in Nieman Reports 
on female leadership in journal-
ism and found the numbers dis-
mal. I love that our college paper 
defies that. Although I certainly 

encountered my first instances 
of newsroom sexism at the Daily, 
I’m proud of the amazing history 
women have made there. What do 
you think accounts for that given 
the overall industry profile?

CALFAS: When I was the 

managing news editor as a sopho-
more, I faced a host of difficulties, 
as I felt I had to prove my worth 
because I was both young for the 
position and a woman. Certainly, 
the majority of my staff did not 
consider these two characteris-
tics as weaknesses, but a few did. 
Growing from the subtle sexism 
I faced in that post, I thought of 
how important it would be to have 
another female editor in chief — 
since it hadn’t been done for five 
years at that point. I can’t count 
how many times male sources of 
mine have called me “sweetie” or 
“honey” during an interview, or 
encountered someone who was 
shocked to hear that I, indeed, 
was the editor in chief of the 
Daily. At a certain point, I would 
think that it’s not the newsrooms 
that are inhibiting the growth 
and empowerment of female lead-

ers, but rather the world around 
us. That’s a tricky issue to solve, 
and affects women in all career 
fields outside of journalism. How 
do you think women can empow-
er themselves to take on these 
challenges?

LIPINSKI: In 2004, while 

I was editor of the Chicago 
Tribune, seven of the nation’s 
25 largest papers were run by 
women. A decade later, that 
number was three. Moreover, 
most of the country’s largest 
news organizations have never 
had a woman at the helm, mak-
ing the Daily, even with the 
challenges you and others have 
regrettably faced, progressive 
by comparison. What I find more 
worrisome is that media manag-
ers of your generation are recre-
ating the same gender and racial 
imbalances atop the new digital 
start-ups. I would have hoped for 
better. Given the opportunity to 
reinvent everything about legacy 
news organizations, the old man-
agement rules persist. I agree 
with you that there are broader 
forces at play, but the problem 
is so pernicious in journalism 
since you’re not likely to repre-
sent the community you cover 
if your newsroom is of a type. 
There’s content analysis suggest-
ing an editor’s gender can have 
meaningful influence on what 
gets covered and who covers it, 
something I know we have both 
experienced.

I wish we had talked more pur-

posefully about this when I was 
at the Daily. You’ve prompted me 
to think back on some election 
assignments one year that had 
every significant candidate going 
to a male reporter, while more 
experienced women were rele-
gated to down-ticket races. I was 
angry, but kept my head down 
and covered my stories, com-
miserating only with friends. So 
my first advice is transparency 
in talking about this. Diversity 
discussions were less common 
in newsrooms then, but should 
be daily occurrences now on 
behalf of improving our cover-
age and expanding our audience, 
a path that should naturally lead 
to more diverse leadership, if 
only as a business imperative. 
Women and men need to rede-
fine success, which in news-
rooms historically favored beats 
more common to men — politics, 
business, foreign news — while 
undervaluing others. The path 
to leadership needs to be wider 
and account for the fact that the 
bruising demands of so-called 
“hard news” can be incompatible 
with family life during stretches 
of a woman’s career. We, all of 
us, need to stop self-replicating 

— favoring and promoting those 
who remind us of ourselves, a 
long game that has never favored 
any minority journalist. And 
we need to find and create role 
models at the earliest points in 
women’s careers. I feel fortunate 
that early in my Daily career we 
had an extraordinary co-editor 
in Cheryl Pilate, someone who 
took an interest in my work and 
modeled for all of us what strong 
leadership looked like. 

You have one semester left 

to your editorship, Jen, and the 
time will go so quickly. When 
others are recalling the Daily 
under your leadership, just as 
I’m recalling Cheryl, what do you 
hope they remember?

CALFAS: When I think back 

to when I joined, I can’t help 
but remember how much I’ve 
changed and progressed as a 
journalist and as a person. With 
such little time left, there’s so 
much left I hope to accomplish 
— but so much of it is within 
the ideology of the newsroom 
as a whole. With a new web-
site developed under my term, I 
hope this inspires future Daily 
editors and staffers to think 
creatively about how our con-
tent can be presented, with a 
digital-first goal in mind. But, 
more than anything, I hope 
I’ve served as an example or 
inspiration for aspiring col-
lege journalists to pursue their 
passions and think beyond just 
themselves and their individu-
al accomplishments. Over any 
other goal, I’ve always viewed 
the Daily as a place where a 
bunch of young journalists 
come together and produce an 
informative, quality product 
for our audience. Working with 
collaborative rather than indi-
vidual goals in mind is some-
thing I hope I instill in this 
staff and future ones as well. 
College journalists — including 
myself — can often get caught 
up in their own aspirations, 
internships and positions on 
the paper rather than the col-
lective goal of the publication. 
This isn’t necessarily a bad 
thing, but something that may 
inhibit the teamwork within 
our organization.

For all the work and passion 

I’ve put into this place, I hope 
others continue to sacrifice for 
the sake of strong, balanced and 
award-winning journalism.

For you, Ann Marie, your 

impact as an editor left a contin-
uous mark on every staffer who 
has entered the newsroom since 
your term. What did you imagine 
your legacy would be while you 
were the editor, and what advice 
do you have for us at the Daily 
now as we move forward in this 
publication and beyond?

LIPINSKI: You’re kind to say 

so, but I got so much more from 
the Daily than I could ever give. 
We’ve stood on the shoulders of 
generations of editors who cared 
deeply about the institution and 
did their best to leave it in bet-
ter shape than they found it. 
But there’s no denying that the 
Daily’s greatest contribution has 
been as a classroom. I made a lot 
of mistakes there and learned 
from them. The Daily’s culture of 
criticism could be harsh, as you 
know, and perhaps less forgiv-
ing than in a journalism school 
classroom since we were acutely 
aware that our efforts were made 
public. It was both thrilling and 
humbling to think of the history 
that was edited in that news-
room — coverage of Franklin 
Roosevelt’s funeral, the Freedom 
Riders, the Alger Hiss trial, news 
of the polio vaccine. The Daily 
made possible a deeper engage-
ment with the campus and the 
larger world, and provided the 
place and the people who would 
challenge us to do our best work. 
We were the lucky ones who got 
to do more than read the his-
tory being made around us, and 
that made the paper an unusual 
campus classroom. When Henry 
Butzel and Harry Jewell founded 
the paper they called the U. of 
M. Daily, they had no capital, no 
publisher and virtually no adver-
tising, but they did have the com-
mitment to more fully represent 
the University community than 
did the fraternity groups pub-
lishing the two existing journals. 
“We built better than we knew,” 
they wrote of their creation some 
50 years later. It’s not for me to 
tell future classes of journal-
ists what building better might 
look like, but I hope the paper 
remains a classroom, a safe place 
for our successors to make the 
mistakes and discoveries that 
will define them.

Happy anniversary, Jen. Take 

care of our Daily.

the 2012 Iowa Caucuses. Like 
Huthwaite, Goldsmith wanted to 
make the political figures she was 
covering relatable to University 
students.

Not only that, Goldsmith also 

said covering a story of that size 
while still a student provided an 
incredibly unique experience.

“I felt like we got a real experi-

ence as journalists in determin-
ing what was worth putting in 
the paper,” she said. “That was 
definitely one of the highlights 
not just of my experience at The 
Michigan Daily, but at Michi-
gan.”

Andrew Schulman was a gov-

ernment beat reporter when 
he was tapped to cover Barack 
Obama’s election night watch 
party in 2012. The party was in 
Chicago at McCormick Place, a 
large convention center along 
Lake Michigan. Schulman said 
he could feel the excitement in 
the room as election results were 
reported.

At the same time, Schulman 

remembers, he had no idea what 
he was going to write before the 
event started, which was over-
whelming.

Still, 
Schulman 
said 
the 

experience helped him moving 
forward when he became a pro-
fessional writer. He’s now a free-
lance reporter.

“It helped me, I guess, in the 

future kind of find a little bit more 
focus,” he said. “It was something 
that I think I learned a lot from.”

Even for Biron, who is now 

working in public relations, get-
ting to cover a speech delivered 
by Obama in Detroit and cover 
government for the Daily helped 
her realize her interest in pub-
lic policy and shaped her career 
goals after school, she said.

“I think I started as an Eng-

lish and Comm double major. 
Then I joined the gov beat and 
fell in love with it,” she said. “If I 
hadn’t, you know, done so many 
of those things on gov beat, I 
wouldn’t have been exposed to 
it — I wouldn’t have realized I’m 
passionate about it.”

which detailed these shifts and 
suggested new initiatives like 
adding a position in charge of 
developing more special issues 
(with 
a 
revenue-generating 

focus in mind) and putting 
together a team to post more 
news content during the day.

Kraus, now an English pro-

fessor at the University of 
Scranton, voted against the 
free-drop proposal. He said it 
was probably the wrong vote 
in hindsight. But at the time, he 
felt compelled to vote in oppo-
sition to take a symbolic stand 
against what he felt the change 
represented.

But Chase says that kind of 

traditionalist mindset is impor-
tant, too.

“It’s that conscience that 

makes the thing keep surviv-
ing no matter what happens to 

the market,” he said. “There are 
smart people who will figure 
out what to do and how to take 
this very rare thing and make 
sure it survives.”

Josh White, a current editor 

at The Washington Post, edited 
the paper in 1997 — a time when 
Daily staffers first started to see 
the website as something more 
than another platform to plop 
the day’s print content. 

In Dec. 1997, the Michigan 

men’s basketball team had 
beaten Duke with a game-win-
ning dunk three seconds before 
the buzzer, and, in that same 
day, Charles Woodson won 
the Heisman Trophy. Class 
had concluded for the semes-
ter, and print production had 
wrapped up, too. The Daily’s 
website — then fairly primitive 
— hosted original, breaking 
news coverage for perhaps the 
first time.

“A really good story about 

something 
really 
important 

can touch millions of people, 
can get a conversation going 
globally, and there’s a lot of 
power in that. I think once peo-
ple started to recognize that, 
the game changed,” White 
said.

“We looked at The Michigan 

Daily as a way to try things, and 
to make mistakes and to learn 
from those mistakes,” he said. 
“We cared intensely about it, 
we tried to do it very carefully 
and ethically, but it was a lab, 
it was a place where you could 
make a mistake and learn from 
it and recover from it and build 
from it.”

So often, buzzwords like 

“tradition” and “innovation” 
are brushed in opposition. But 
maybe the Daily’s history tells 
us that’s simply not true.

“The Daily has done a spec-

tacular job of changing in the 
way that it needs to change,” 
Kraus said. “And that is precisely 
its tradition.”

Student reporters 
compete with the 

professionals

By EMILIE PLESSET

Daily News Editor

When a group of University 

students published the first issue 
of The Michigan Daily in Sep-
tember 1890, it was one of seven 
newspapers servicing the city of 
Ann Arbor. As the Daily enters 
its 125th year, it now stands as 
the city’s only daily print paper. 
Throughout its long history, the 
Daily has not only covered Ann 
Arbor and University news, but 
also generated national attention 
with its reporting.

When The Ann Arbor News 

ended its 174-year daily print run 
in July 2009, the Daily became the 
only paper in the city printing five 
days a week. The Ann Arbor News 
is now run by the digital media 
platform MLive.

MLive reporter Jeremy Allen, 

who predominantly covers the 
University, said there is some 
competition over who publishes 
a story first, but MLive and the 
Daily serve readers differently. 
The Ann Arbor News is charged 
primarily with serving the people 
of Ann Arbor, whereas the Daily 
largely caters to the University 
community.

“We kind of work together to 

provide coverage across the entire 
spectrum of anyone who has an 
interest in the University of Mich-
igan,” Allen said.

University alum Gary Graca, 

who served as the Daily’s editor in 
chief when The Ann Arbor News 

announced the end of its daily 
print production, said though the 
Daily had always covered issues 
influencing the Ann Arbor com-
munity, the announcement incit-
ed the Daily’s staff to expand its 
coverage of the city.

“It’s a stretch to say the issues 

of the campus and the city are not 
intertwined, and the Daily clearly 
has a strong edge and clearly has 
the ability to cover high-level city 
issues,” Graca said. “That was 
kind of the thinking. How can we 
do the city council issues, how can 
we do the interaction between the 
city and campus better, and the 
city ordinance issues that affect 
student lives better?”

Throughout its long history as 

the University’s most prominent 
student publication, the Daily has 
found itself repeatedly making 
national headlines and, at times, 
breaking stories before its profes-
sional counterparts.

In April 1955, Daily reporter 

Hanley McGurwin packed into 
a Rackham Building auditorium 
to hear Dr. Thomas Francis Jr. 
— the University’s head epide-
miologist at the time and leader 
of the field trial testing the polio 
vaccine developed by Jonas Salk 
— describe the vaccine as “safe, 
effective and potent.”

The news, which the Daily 

reported first, was celebrated 
across the country, as parents 
finally had a scientifically-proven 
means of protecting their children 
from polio, a major cause of death 
for children in the first half of the 
20th century.

The Daily achieved national 

prominence again in September 
1957, when it sent a staff report-
er to Little Rock Central High 

School in Arkansas to pose as a 
student and cover the school’s 
integration. James Elsman Jr., 
then the Daily’s editorial direc-
tor, wrote an eyewitness-account 
of the Little Rock Nine’s first day 
of class, reporting that only a little 
more than half the school’s stu-
dents attended class that day.

The Daily has also garnered 

national attention as other news-
papers have looked to the Daily 
for its noteworthy journalism. 
In 1967, The Washington Post 
published an article about the 
Daily after the student-run paper 
printed an editorial calling for 
the legalization of marijuana. The 
Post, quoting the article by Har-
vey Wasserman, then-University 
student, noted that the editorial 
described marijuana as having no 
worse effects than alcohol.

More 
recently, 
The 
New 

York Times published a lengthy 
article about the Daily and its 
coverage of a University scandal 
involving a member of the foot-
ball team. As the Times noted, 
the Daily was the first to report 
that Brendan Gibbons, former 
football starting kicker, had per-
manently “separated” from the 
University for violating the Stu-
dent Sexual Misconduct Policy 
five years prior.

The Times wrote that while the 

news of the scandal was shocking 
for the Ann Arbor community, the 
origin of the news was almost as 
shocking.

“The story was not broken by 

the local, professional news orga-
nization, The Ann Arbor News,” 
the Times wrote. “Instead, it 
was uncovered by The Michigan 
Daily, the university’s indepen-
dently-run student newspaper.”

One Hundred Twenty-Fifth Anniversary

Hill performances 
through the years

Sports writers recall 
their favorite road trips

Traveling to cover 
games across the 
country is a sacred 

Daily tradition

By KEVIN SANTO

Daily Sports Writer

There’s only one thing that 

could connect the dots between 
an impounded car in Chicago, 
a week in Hawaii, a 1,000-
mile drive to Oklahoma City, 
a 24-hour Greyhound trip to 
Omaha and a journey to Alaska.

It’s 
a 
hypothetical 
line 

labeled, “Michigan Daily Sports 
Road Trips.”

But those trips are much more 

than just stories told around the 
newsroom from time to time. 
When former Daily writers look 
back on them, they remember 
how it felt to drive back to Ann 
Arbor on a random interstate at 
some ungodly hour, wondering 
if the road would ever end. But 
they also recall the thought 
they had immediately following 
that: how hundreds of Daily 
writers have been on that same 
interstate throughout the past 
125 years.

One of those writers, Liz 

Vukelich, covered the Michigan 
hockey 
team’s 
most 
recent 

NCAA Tournament appearance 
in 2012. The lesson she learned 
on the drive to Green Bay was 
rather unfortunate.

Vukelich and her fellow beat 

writers— Everett Cook, Zach 
Helfand and Matt Slovin — 
stopped in Chicago for dinner 
en route to the tournament. 
Due to the traffic in the city, 
the group resorted to parking 
in a Walgreens across the street 
from their restaurant of choice. 
An hour later, after dinner, the 
hockey beat returned to the 
Walgreens only to discover their 
car was missing.

“We were kind of freaking 

out, like, ‘Oh my God, did the 
car get stolen?’ ” Vukelich said. 
“Then we realized there was 
this big sign saying, ‘Parking for 
Walgreens customers only.’ We 
thought we were in the clear 
because we had gone in (the 
store) to buy a stick of gum.”

According to Vukelich, they 

were visibly distressed in the 
parking lot when a cab driver 
came to their rescue. The driver 
explained that he saw the car 
get towed, and offered them a 
free ride to the car impound, 
where they found Slovin’s car. 
Though the debacle set the four 
reporters back a few hours and 
a few hundred dollars, they 
arrived in Green Bay in time to 
cover the game.

“It’s funny, because I live 

in Chicago now, and I walk by 
that Walgreens all the time,” 
Vukelich said. “It’s weird that 
one of the most memorable road 
trip experiences I have is almost 
part of my daily life here. Every 
time I walk by it, I always have 
to Snapchat a picture of it to my 
friends that were on the beat 
with me that year.”

While 
Vukelich 
had 
an 

unpleasant experience on the 
road, Sharat Raju’s time as a 
1998 Michigan football beat 
writer was entirely different.

The Daily paid for Raju, along 

with fellow beat writers Mark 
Snyder and Jim Rose, to spend a 
week in Hawaii to cover the final 
regular-season football game 
against the Rainbow Warriors 
as well as the Maui Invitational, 

in which the men’s basketball 
team was competing. 

Given that the trip happened 

over 
Thanksgiving 
Break, 

the paper was rarely printed, 
essentially giving Raju and 
the beat writers a Hawaiian 
vacation with a side of sports 
writing.

“It was almost all down 

time,” Raju said. “It was over 
Thanksgiving, so we didn’t have 
that many stories during the 
week. I think Jim Rose wrote a 
column the day before classes 
let out. It was something to the 
effect of, ‘The light in the hotel 
bathroom in Maui isn’t working. 
And that is the only bad thing 
that has happened so far.’ ”

Raju, Snyder and Rose stayed 

at the media hotel, which 
happened to be on the beach, 
and celebrated Thanksgiving 
together at the hotel buffet.

As if that wasn’t enough, the 

trio went kayaking and took a 
scooter tour around Honolulu 
— led by a high-school friend of 
Raju’s, who was serving in the 
Army and stationed in Hawaii at 
the time.

As he recalls, the group’s free 

trip to Hawaii warranted some 
jealousy from veteran reporters.

“I remember the Free Press or 

the (Detroit) News reporter said, 
‘Oh, good. Answering the age-
old question: How many Daily 
reporters does it take to cover a 
football game in Hawaii?’ ” Raju 
said.

While Raju was part of the 

Daily’s most enjoyable warm-
weather trip, writers have faced 
a fair share of cold climates in 
order to provide sports coverage 
as well — none more notable 
than Geoffrey Gagnon’s history-
making trip to Alaska.

On October 22, 1999, Gagnon 

took part in the Daily’s first trip 
to Alaska to cover the Michigan 
hockey team’s exhibition against 
Alaska-Fairbanks in Anchorage.

“(This) represents the latest 

renewal in the Daily’s efforts 
to spare no burden and avoid 
no 
distance 
in 
providing 

comprehensive 
coverage,” 

Gagnon wrote in his column 
upon arrival. “As we settle in 
on the Kenai Peninsula near the 
Turnagain Arm we embrace a 
chance to make a bit of Daily 
history of our own.”

Yet not even a nine-hour 

flight to Anchorage can beat the 
voyages Greg Garno and Jamie 
Turner took to cover College 
World Series in Oklahoma City 
and Omaha, respectively. 

In 1978, Turner stayed in Ann 

Arbor to take summer classes, 
and three staff members were 
rotating on coverage of the 
Michigan baseball team.

When 
the 
Wolverines 

punched their ticket to the 
College World Series in Omaha, 
Turner was the only writer 
available to cover it. However, 
the Daily could only pay for a 
hotel, leaving the other expenses 
to fall on Turner’s shoulders. 

Turner’s solution for making 

the 
trip 
more 
affordable 

was to take a 24-hour-long 
Greyhound bus ride to Omaha, 
which warranted surprise and 
sympathy from some of his 
fellow passengers.

“You (would) have some 

conversations with people who 
inevitably will say, ‘I’m going 
from 
Chicago 
to 
Rockford. 

Where are you going?’ ” Turner 
said. “I’d say Omaha and they’d 
just say, ‘Oh my god.’ ”

Despite the exhausting bus 

ride, Turner did receive a small 

reward when he arrived at his 
hotel in Omaha.

While he was waiting in the 

lobby of the hotel, Turner ran 
into Tom Hemingway, the radio 
voice of Michigan athletics at 
the time. Since Turner didn’t 
have a credit card, ATMs didn’t 
exist and the hotel wouldn’t 
accept an out-of-state check, he 
struck up a conversation with 
Hemingway to ask him to cash a 
check for him.

The 
conversation 
evolved 

to the point where Turner 
told 
Hemingway 
how 
he 

occasionally broadcasted games 
for the student section, at which 
point Turner got a job offer.

If the Wolverines defeated 

Baylor on Thursday, they would 
play again Friday, the same day 
as 
Hemingway’s 
daughter’s 

high school graduation. After 
Michigan shut out the Bears, 
4-0, Turner broadcasted the 
following game against then-
No. 1 Southern California.

Though the eventual national 

champions 
walloped 
the 

Wolverines, 10-3, Turner was 
still left with a lasting memory 
and memento.

“My parents recorded (my 

broadcast) on a cassette,” Turner 
said. “It’s buried somewhere 
in my mother’s belongings. I’m 
sure she’s the only person who 
ever heard the whole thing, 
because it was terrible.”

Thirty-five years later, with 

almost no one available during 
the Daily’s summer production, 
Garno was forced to take his 
1999 GMC Jimmy, which had 
already accumulated 110,000 
miles, on a trek to the Women’s 
College 
World 
Series 
with 

photographer Nick Williams.

He was awake until midnight 

on Wednesday producing the 
Daily’s summer edition, and left 
immediately from the Stanford 
Lipsey 
Student 
Publications 

Building that night to begin 
his drive. As he traveled to 
Oklahoma, he realized there 
were rainstorms moving toward 
the same destination. Garno said 
he was pushing the speed limit 
to race by storms that would 
have become tornadoes, but 
arrived safely to cover the event 
that day.

Friday, however, his luck 

ran out. Garno recalled how at 
one moment it was extremely 
sunny, before the sky turned 
dark almost instantaneously — a 
sign that a tornado was about to 
touch down in Oklahoma City.

“Eventually, 
(while) 
I’m 

running on six hours of sleep, 
there was a tornado warning 
in a mall, where I’m (hiding) in 
an unfinished basement area,” 
Garno said. “The entire time I 
don’t really know what’s going 
on because my phone doesn’t 
have any service. Eventually, 
the tornadoes passed and we 
were okay. My car was intact, 
and we celebrated with Chick-
fil-A.”

The 
Wolverines 
were 

knocked out of the tournament 
on 
Sunday, 
and 
Garno 

immediately started the drive 
back to Ann Arbor because he 
had class Monday afternoon.

Garno’s trip — along with 

those of the writers who came 
before him — are the most 
concrete representation of the 
lengths the Daily sports staff 
has gone to in order to provide 
Michigan sports coverage for 
125 years. If there’s a story to 
be found, there are few length 
Daily sports writers won’t go in 
order to find it.

Athletics returns to a 
more traditional vibe 

one year into new 
administration

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

University 
Presi-

dent Mark Schlissel 
and his administra-
tion have spent the last 
academic year work-
ing to roll out new 

policy initiatives around several 
campus issues — most notably ath-
letics, diversity, alcohol abuse and 
Greek life. This week, The Michigan 
Daily reviews the events that got the 
ball rolling. Today, we consider a 
year of transition in the University’s 
Athletic Department.

The overview: The University 

is roughly a year removed from a 
chain of events that resulted in a 
reevaluation of the state of its Ath-
letic Department. Former Athletic 
Director Dave Brandon stepped 
down amid general backlash — 

marked by resentment of high stu-
dent ticket prices and controversy 
after former football coach Brady 
Hoke put a concussed Shane Mor-
ris, a then-sophomore quarter-
back, in during the September 2014 
matchup Minnesota.

The changes: Since University 

President Mark Schlissel’s arrival 
on campus, drastic changes have 
been made. Student season football 
ticket prices fell from $295 to $175. 
The team is 3-1, and is ranked at 
No. 22 in the AP Top 25 poll. Coach 
Jim Harbaugh has lived up to the 
hype so far, and Schlissel attri-
butes much of the Athletic Depart-
ment’s success to Interim Athletic 
Director Jim Hackett.

The context: When the Univer-

sity hired Schlissel last year, no one 
quite knew what to expect with 
regard to the Athletic Department 
going forward.

Previously the provost of Brown 

University, Schlissel came from a 
school with a far less prestigious 
athletic pedigree. While Brown 
competes in 37 varsity sports to 
Michigan’s 27, almost none are on 
the same level. The brand is lesser 

Online retailer to 
expand downtown 
office into company 

‘tech hub’

By ISOBEL FUTTER

Daily Staff Reporter

University President Mark 

Schlissel was on hand in Detroit 
Monday 
as 
online 
retailer 

Amazon announced plans to 

expand their presence in the city.

At a press conference at Cobo 

Center, Amazon officials said 
the company plans to build a 
“technology hub” in downtown 
Detroit. Their current office, 
located 
on 
West 
Jefferson 

Avenue, will be expanded to 
multiple floors early next year. 
It is not immediately clear how 
many employees will be hired 
with the expansion.

In 
remarks 
at 
the 

announcement, 
Schlissel 

said Amazon has a strong 

relationship with the University, 
providing 
recruitment 
and 

internship 
opportunities 

to students. Amazon is the 
technology 
sector’s 
top 

recruiter for business students.

“I am thrilled that Amazon’s 

investment will create more 
opportunities for U-M students 
and graduates to contribute to 
the resurgence of Michigan’s 
economy,” he said, according 
to a copy of the remarks as 
prepared for delivery.

During 
his 
comments, 

Schlissel touted the work of 
University students in Detroit 
as 
interns 
and 
volunteers, 

including the annual student-
led Detroit Partnership Day, 
which engages 1,500 student 
volunteers 
participating 
in 

projects across the city.

He said Amazon’s expansion 

will likely play a role in 
encouraging some students to 
stay in Detroit post-graduation.

retells history

“How 
does 
a 
bastard, 

orphan, son of a whore and 
a Scotsman dropped in the 
middle of a forgotten spot in 
the Caribbean by providence, 
impoverished, 
in 
squalor, 

grow up to be a hero and a

The opening line of Lin-

Manuel

most 

recent 
musical 
creation, 

“Hamilton,” 
sets 
the 

stage 
for 
a 
fast-paced,

moving 
and 

rebellious 
recounting 
of 

classic 
American 
history. 

With a cast of primarily 
Black and Hispanic actors to 
play the Founding Fathers, 

Miranda reckons that this is 
representative of America as 
it is now — a melting pot of 
cultures and diversity. This 
casting call and many other 
details 
solidify 
Miranda’s 

role as one of the greatest 
playwrights of his generation.

It seems like the entire 

world 
is 
buzzing 
about 

“Hamilton.” 
Since 
its 

recent debut on Broadway, 
the musical and its cast 
have received more praise 
than ever for exceptional 
performances, 
impressive 

vocals and unique linguistic 
characteristics. The album, 
which was released on Sept. 
25, combines history with hip 
hop and educates a modern 
population on how America 
was founded. Rap, R&B and 
ballads intertwine seamlessly 
to tug on heartstrings and 
remind us of what it means to 
strive to prove your worth.

A crime alert reporting two 

armed robberies off campus was 
issued by the University’s Division 
of Public Safety and Security 
on Monday. The incidents, as 
reported to the Ann Arbor Police, 
occurred at 11 p.m. Sunday and 12 
a.m. Monday.

The first incident reportedly 

occurred near Packard Street and

Members of 

SACUA criticize 
plans at weekly 
Monday meeting

By GENEVIEVE HUMMER

Daily Staff Reporter

Engineering 
Prof. 
James 

Holloway, the vice provost for 
Global and Engaged Education, 

said Monday the University 
could implement plans to release 
course evaluation data as early as 
this semester.

Holloway’s 
announcement 

at Monday’s Senate Assembly 
Committee on University Affairs’ 
meeting came as a surprise 
to many of the committee’s 
members.

According to Holloway, the 

University will release numerical 
data from the first four questions 
on student course evaluations via 

a website accessible only to those 
with a University uniqname 
account. 
Holloway 
said 
the 

prototype website has been 
up and running for six to eight 
months. Though the site has 
featured limited data, he said it 
provides a rough outline of what 
the actual site will look like.

In an interview with The 

Michigan 
Daily 
after 
the 

meeting, SACUA chair Silke-
Maria Weineck, a professor of

University plans release 
of course evaluation data


comparative literature, said the 
plan was formed without sufficient 
faculty input.

“It has not been debated at 

SACUA and it has not been debated 
at Senate Assembly, and so we 
feel like there hasn’t been enough 
broad consultation because this is 
something that affects everyone, 
faculty and students,” Weineck said.

Comments 
written 
on 
the 

evaluations will not be released, 
nor will the data collected from 
course evaluations of classes taught 
by graduate student instructors or 
instructors with fewer than seven 
terms of teaching experience.

Holloway said though student 

organizations have compiled course 
evaluation data in the past by 
obtaining the information through 
Freedom 
of 
Information 
Act 

requests, the process has often been 
inconsistent.

“It was sometimes done in some 

rather idiosyncratic ways,” he said. 
“And of course it’s difficult for a 
student group, with students cycling 
in and out, for them to maintain some 
consistency in quality. So the data 
was being released but not always 
presented in a meaningful way.”

Holloway said the data, which 

had been requested by Central 
Student 
Government, 
LSA 

Student 
Government 
and 
the 

Rackham Graduate School Student 
Government, is important to students.

“The primary drivers for this are 

that the students have requested it 
and have made the point that the data 
is data they give us with their own 
volition, and they have some agency 
and interest in this data,” he said.

However, 
SACUA 
members 

expressed 
concern 
with 
the 

University’s plan to release current 
course evaluation data.

Weineck said a majority of faculty 

members dislike the current course 
evaluation methods.

“In my 17 years at the University 

of Michigan, I have not heard from 
a single person that thinks this is a 
good instrument providing good 
data,” she said. “In sum, nobody 
thinks that these are good data. 
And whatever they are, they were 
not designed to assist students in 
choosing classes; it is the wrong 
instrument for that. So what we’ve 
been saying at the Senate Assembly, 
it’s not that we don’t think students 
don’t have a legitimate interest in 
having more and better information 
on how to choose classes, but we 
think at a world-class University it 
behooves us to design an instrument 
that can actually deliver the data 

needed for that purpose. “

Kinesiology 
Prof. 
Stefan 

Szymanski, a SACUA member, 
questioned the University’s decision 
to release data that could affect 
faculty’s personal and professional 
lives. 

“I’ve met people who have had 

their lives more or less ruined 
by this,” Szymanski said. “What 
happens if some day somebody 
commits suicide because this went 
public and all their students were 
talking about how bad it was. Is it a 
good idea for us to uptake a process 
that might wind up ruining people’s 
lives?”

Responding 
to 
Szymanski, 

Holloway said he “rejects the 
premise of the question.”

Engineering Prof. Bill Schultz, 

SACUA’s vice chair, questioned 
the educational implications of 
releasing course evaluation data.

“Are you at all concerned that if 

more emphasis is put on this that 
faculty will teach to the evaluations 
and will that have a negative 
learning effect?” Schultz asked. “I 
think the answer has to be yes.”

Committee 
members 
also 

debated 
the 
extent 
to 
which 

final student grades, as well as a 
professor’s gender and race can 
invoke bias in course evaluations.

Weineck said faculty governance, 

student government and experts 
in assessment at the University — 
such as the Center for Research on 
Learning and Teaching — should 
work together to form a new 
evaluation instrument, one that will 
better address student and faculty 
needs.

In response, Holloway said the 

process would take too long.

“It’ll take longer than a year,” 

he said. “We’re a long breath 
institution, but I think our students 
who are here for a shorter time 
deserve a faster response than that.”

SACUA members and Holloway 

did not reach a consensus during 
the meeting, and Weineck said it 
is hard to know how the plan to 
release course evaluation data will 
proceed from here.

“We don’t know what his long 

term reaction to this meeting will 
be,” Weineck said after the meeting. 
“But we will discuss this at the 
next Senate Assembly meeting 
in October because we think lots 
of faculty members should be 
consulted.”

The 
next 
Senate 
Assembly 

meeting will be held Oct. 26.

Print paper 

continues while
 growing online 

presence

By TANYA MADHANI

Daiily Staff Reporter

In the past 25 years, The 

Michigan Daily has cut its print 
paper down from more than 12 
pages to eight, adopted a more 
digital-focused platform, started 
a weekly news magazine and cre-
ated several smaller online blogs 
to add in extra digital content.

And all of these changes are in 

line with the shifting nature of 
the journalism industry.

Chris Baxter, one of this 

year’s Knight-Wallace Fellows 
and a statehouse reporter for NJ 
Advance Media, said the shift to 
promote online content is noth-
ing to be surprised by.

“The reality is, the Internet 

changed everything in terms of 
delivering the news and present-
ing the news and how the news 
is being consumed and who is 
consuming it,” he said. “So really, 
a wide array of the way things 
have been done have changed 
very quickly with the advent of 
the Internet and news essentially 
becoming free rather than a pub-
lic commodity.”

While physical copies of The 

Michigan Daily have been avail-
able for free for decades, major 
newspapers such as The New 
York Times, The Wall Street 
Journal and USA Today still 
charge for theirs. With the rise 
of the online content, Baxter 
said these papers have also been 
forced to offer up their content 
for free on their website — or at 
least part of it.

The question for most news-

papers trying to keep up with 
changing technology is how to 
continue making money.

Business models like online 

paywalls are an effort to increase 
physical paper circulations and 
print advertising revenues, both 
of which have, according to the 
Pew Research Center’s State of 
the News Media 2014 report, con-
tinue to fall each year. Digital ad 
revenues, on the other hand, digi-
tal advertising has grown, with 
$50.7 billion spent on digital ads 
last year alone. 

University alum Joseph Lich-

terman, who was the Daily’s 
editor in chief in 2012 and now 
writes for the Nieman Journal-
ism Lab at Harvard University, 
said print advertising continues 
to make up a larger chunk of 
advertising revnue than digital 
advertisement, even as print cir-
culation decreases. 

“That’s probably the biggest 

reason why the Daily is still 
printing every day,” Lichterman 
said. “It’s because print advertis-
ing really makes far more.”

LSA senior Rose Filipp, the 

Daily’s current business manag-
er, said print advertising is criti-
cal to the paper’s operation. 

“Many people I have talked to 

assume that print advertising is 
dead, but that just isn’t the real-
ity yet,” she said in an e-mail. 
“Advertisers still value the abil-
ity to put their information into 
their clients’ hands. Addition-
ally, the Daily has put out some 
new special guides, which we 
consider to be niche advertising 
products.”

Baxter said print papers aren’t 

going away just yet.

“Even at The New York Times, 

while digital revenue at compa-
nies that are making a go of it is 
increasing double digits every 
year, it’s still way behind what 
print advertising revenue was,” 
he said. “Print advertising rev-
enue still far eclipses digital rev-
enue and frankly, that’s why the 
age-old prediction that’s been 
being made since I was in high 
school, that newspapers are going 

to die, that’s why it hasn’t hap-
pened.”

But many newsrooms are 

increasingly embracing a digital-
first model, according to Danya 
Bacchus, another Knight-Wal-
lace fellow. Bacchus, an NBC 
anchor in San Diego, said when 
she works on a story, the first 
thing she does is post it on the 
web.

“I’m tweeting and I’m posting 

on Facebook,” she said. “They 
want us to periscope. Now they 
want us to Snapchat so the main 
focus isn’t about putting the prod-
uct on air, but it’s more so getting 
it to digital first and then trying 
to figure out how you can get the 
viewer or the person who’s look-
ing at their phone to then watch 
the newscast.”

But with the increasing use of 

social media among journalists, 
Bacchus said, they should also 
take increased precautions when 
using sources obtained through 
social media.

“There’s still room for so 

many little mistakes,” she said. 
“Though it’s all this access to 
information, you still have to do 
your due diligence in making sure 
that information is correct.”

But despite the majority of 

news moving online and mobile, 
Baxter said the core journalistic 
values remain the same. 

“There is a lot about journal-

ism that hasn’t changed and 
that really is the foundation of 
the skills of what makes a good 
journalist,” Baxter said. “Ram-
pant curiosity, ability to ask, 
sharp insightful questions, an 
ability to see through noise and 
nonsense, an ability to ascertain 
documents and work human 
sources and structure complex 
stories and write in a way that’s 
clear and concise and accurate, 
these are all skills that are just 
as relevant and important and 
necessary for high-achieving 
journalists now as they were 25 
years ago.”

TWITTER TALK: TMD BIRTHDAY EDITION

125TH ANNIVERSARY


known, the level of competition 
lower and the revenue far small-
er.

As a symbolic measure of com-

parison, Michigan Stadium’s list-
ed capacity is 107,601 spectators. 
Brown Stadium’s is 20,000.

Schlissel stepped into a world 

that was, at least in this respect, 
much different than the one he 
left. While he doesn’t have to run 
this world, he does have to over-
see it, and his first year forced 
him to be more involved than 
a number of school presidents. 
Despite this, Schlissel is quick to 
note that he’s no stranger to the 
athletic realm.

“I don’t think I was as naive as 

many people suggested I was,” 
Schlissel said in a September 
interview with the Daily. “I’ve 
been a sports fan as an individual 
my whole life. I played basketball 
and tennis growing up, played 
golf in high school, went to base-
ball games with my dad. It’s not 
as if I’m unaware of the sports 
world.”

The 
University 
Athletic 

Department was at a crossroads 
when he arrived. Ticket sales for 
the department’s flagship sport, 
football, were low, while prices 
were at an all-time high. The 
football team was struggling. 
Athletic Director Dave Brandon 
was on uneasy terms with the 
Michigan fan base.

But 
the 
department 
has 

rebuilt, stabilized and built up its 
good will with the fans. Ticket 
sales have rebounded, Jim Har-
baugh has taken the helm of the 
football program and Hackett 
has pleased the fans, by and 
large.

Before those situations got 

better, though, they got worse.

* * *

When Michigan historians 

look back on this year and all of 
the upheaval it brought, they will 
see Oct. 31, 2014 as the turning 
point. That day, Schlissel accept-
ed Brandon’s resignation and 
replaced him, for the time being, 
with Hackett. Since then, the 
Athletic Department’s person-
ality — and the public’s percep-
tion of its success — has changed 
immeasurably.

Before then, morale among 

fans was at a historic low. Schlis-
sel took office at the beginning of 
football season, and that season 
brought an average attendance 
of 105,371, the lowest since 1991, 
according to the Bentley Histori-
cal Library.

Many sports, especially the 

non-revenue sports, were thriv-
ing. Brandon had upgraded a 
number of facilities and had 
plans to upgrade more, and the 
teams had been successful, too 
— men’s gymnastics and men’s 
swimming both won national 
championships during his ten-
ure.

But ticket prices and other off-

field issues in football bothered 
fans, and as the on-field product 
worsened, so too did the image of 
the department. On Oct. 23, 2014, 
in a dual announcement with the 
Central Student Government, 
the department lowered student 
season ticket prices from $280 to 
$175. It seemed like a last-ditch 
effort to save Brandon’s job, but it 
wasn’t enough.

Schlissel said student backlash 

went “beyond having a football 
team that didn’t achieve a record 
that met people’s expectations.”

“It was part of the issue, why 

people were anxious, but it 

wasn’t the main issue,” he told 
the Daily in September. “I think, 
what people felt was, football in 
particular and perhaps the other 
sports were becoming more 
distant from the campus. That 
they were becoming more of an 
enterprise and less of an activity. 
I think our non-athlete students 
… felt estranged — they felt like 
customers.

“I think we’ve gone a long way 

in the months since … to reset 
the way the Athletic Department 
views its role on the campus,” he 
added.

When Brandon resigned on 

Oct. 31, Michigan was 3-5 and 
coming off a second straight 
blowout loss at Michigan State 
University. Students had print-
ed shirts that read “Fire Dave 
Brandon” and planned to wear 
them to the next day’s home 
game against Indiana University. 
Chants calling for Brandon’s fir-
ing had become regular at Michi-
gan Stadium.

The Athletic Department had 

been embarrassed off the field 
during Schlissel’s first months, 
too. There were, of course, the 
lighthearted incidents, such as 
the promotion to give away two 
free tickets with the purchase of 
two Coke products at the Michi-
gan Union.

But more serious, of course, 

was the incident regarding quar-
terback Shane Morris’ injury 
against the University of Min-
nesota on Sept. 27, just more than 
three weeks into Schlissel’s ten-
ure. Morris sustained a jarring 
hit to the helmet and was slow to 
get up early in the fourth quarter. 
Then-head coach Brady Hoke 
then left him in the game for one 
play, took him out and re-insert-
ed him three plays later.

That incident, and the Univer-

subjects. One of the subjects 
displayed a black handgun and 
demanded property.

The suspects were described 

as two Black males in their early 

20s. One was wearing a dark 
hooded shirt and the other was 
wearing dark clothing and a 
floppy bucket hat.

wonderful opportunity to talk 
to groups of these students,” he 
said. “Many tell me that the work 
they do here is inspiring them 
to live and work in Detroit after 
they graduate. When companies 
like Amazon make a lasting 
commitment to the city, those 
dreams become reality. We have 
a great partnership to build on.”

During his first year in office, 

Schlissel made several efforts to 
engage members of the University 
community 
with 
Detroit. 
In 

August, he hosted an event for 
University 
students 
interning 

in the city. When Schlissel first 
moved to Michigan, the first stop 
on his tour of the state was Detroit. 
The president has also emphasized 
efforts to encourage high school 

students in Detroit to apply to the 
University and in May, he visited 
with students at Detroit’s Cass 
Technical High School.

“I look forwarding to building 

on this energy as we continue 
to engage in Detroit — because 
Detroit is essential to our campus 
and its future,” he said. “And to 
the state of Michigan and our 
collective future.”

UHS now offering 
sexual assault exam

The University Health Service 

now 
provides 
an 
exam 
for 

survivors of sexual assault.

A 
Sexual 
Assault 
Nurse 

Examiner conducts the exam. 
These nurses are trained to 
identify physical trauma as a 
result of a sexual assault, give 
preventative 
measures 
for 

sexually transmitted infections 
and pregnancy, as well as collect 
evidence for survivors to use if 
they would like to press charges.

It’s 
recommended 
for 

survivors to come in for the 
examination within five days of 
the sexual asault. 

Survivors can also be examined 

at 
the 
University 
Hospital 

Emergency Department any time.

The new initiative was created 

as part of a push by Central 
Student Government to increase 
services for survivors of sexual 
assault. 

University joins

to create online resources for 
students applying to college.

The first online tool is set 

to be launched this January. It 
will include a digital portfolio, a 
place for students to collaborate 
and an application portal.

The coalition hopes these 

online tools will improve the 
application process for minority 
and low-income students.

EMU loses money 
on beer sales at 
football games

Eastern Michigan University 

lost about $3,000 when the uni-
versity tried selling beer at their 
home game against Ball State 
University two weeks ago.

The University of Michigan 

does not currently sell beer at 
the Big House.

A report in The Ann Arbor 

News indicates EMU paid $7,000 
for a beer truck and increased 
security measures, but only net-
ted $4,000 during the game. The 
16-ounce cans of beer sold for $7. 

After the loss in sales, EMU’s 

athletic director reported the 
school will no longer sell beer at 
games.

ALLISON FARRAND/Daily

Interim Athletic Director Jim Hackett holds a town hall meeting with students on April 1, 2015.

JAMES COLLER/Daily

University President Mark Schlissel takes a photo with football fans at the Alumni Association’s tailgate in Salt Lake City 
before the game against Utah.

sity’s handling of it in the coming 
days, became a national story for 
the entire week that followed. 
Brandon stood by Hoke, and vice 
versa, but it became clear at that 
point that change was inevitable.

In this atmosphere, Schlissel 

handed Hackett the keys to the 
Athletic Department and asked 
him to start picking up the pieces.

***

Little by little, Hackett has 

turned around the perception of 
Michigan athletics in the eyes of 
fans. His biggest step in doing so 
— almost as big as Schlissel hiring 
him — was bringing Harbaugh to 
Ann Arbor.

“I think hiring Coach Har-

baugh was fantastic,” Schlissel 
said. “I think he was the … best 
coach on the market, college or 
pro, at the time we were looking 
for a coach. So boy, that was for-
tunate for us that he was avail-
able. And it was a testimony to the 
recruiting skills of Jim Hackett, 
but also the allure of the Univer-
sity of Michigan to an alum who 
sort of grew up here.”

Overall, Schlissel added, Har-

baugh’s 
presence 
on 
campus 

marks a “wonderful honeymoon.”

Exactly four weeks passed 

between the day Hackett fired 
Hoke and the day Harbaugh was 
introduced as head coach. Hack-
ett had his sights set on Harbaugh 
for much of that time, and in the 
end events conspired to allow 
Harbaugh to fly on a private plane 
to Michigan on Dec. 29, 2014.

The 
coach 
has 
dominated 

headlines for most of the past 
eight months, but Hackett has 
still been busy in the shadows. He 
has had the benefit of a new sup-
porting cast as well. That includes 
Chrissi Rawak, who heads exter-
nal relations and strategic initia-
tives, and Rob Rademacher, who 
heads facilities and day-to-day 
operations. Hackett also brought 
in Bob De Carolis, the former 
Oregon State University athletic 
director, as a senior adviser.

Hackett has not set a timetable 

for his future as athletic director. 
His title still carries the “interim” 
tag, and though it hasn’t been dis-
cussed much lately. He took the 
job soon after retiring as chief 
executive of Steelcase Furni-
ture, and he hasn’t decided on his 
future between Michigan and his 
family.

When he was asked in April 

about how long he plans to have 
the job, his wife, Kathy, interject-
ed. At that time, the Hacketts had 
two sons, two grandchildren and 
a third grandchild on the way and 
had to balance family and the job.

“We’re back and forth, we don’t 

really have time,” Kathy Hackett 
said. “I will answer: There’s lots 
to be done and he will see to it 
(until) he feels it’s all good.”

Once Hackett replaced Bran-

don and public reaction to the 
Morris controversy died down, 
the rebuilding process could 
begin. In the days after Morris’ 
injury, Schlissel called for “a thor-
ough review of our in-game play-
er safety procedures, particularly 
those involving head injuries.”

Brandon called for two imme-

diate changes to the injury pro-
tocol. First, he put an “athletic 
medicine professional” in the 
press box to have a bird’s-eye 
view of the game as well as the 
benefit of replay. He also said the 
department was “examining how 
to reinforce our sideline commu-
nication processes” to communi-
cate that information.

The review Schlissel requested 

was published on the University’s 
website on April 16. It concluded 
that the University’s medical 
team, medical staff on the field, 
abilities of the medical team and 
policies regarding health were all 
comparable to other schools from 

the Big Ten, ACC, SEC, Big 12 and 
Pac-12.

The review did, however, call 

for an extra trainer in the press 
box instead of on the field to pro-
vide an overhead view. It also laid 
out a plan for communication 
between the trainers during the 
game to avoid another incident 
similar to what happened last 
September. That effort has been 
in effect this fall at Michigan Sta-
dium.

The concussion incident was 

only one roadblock in the Athletic 
Department’s way as it tried to 
overcome the problems of 2014. 
The changes appear to have 
accomplished that as Michigan 
forges on toward a new future.

***

The final effects of many of 

Hackett’s actions have yet to be 
determined, but the decisions he 
has made, he has made with con-
viction.

Earlier this year, Harbaugh 

hired 
childhood 
friend 
and 

Marine veteran Jim Minick as 
his director of operations. Minick 
was later promoted to associate 
athletic director for football, was 
arrested for drunk driving on 
May 8 and blew a blood alcohol 
concentration of 0.185. On July 
8, Hackett revealed that he had 
refused a letter of resignation 
from Minick.

“This is a man who served 

seven tours of duty (in the 
Marines),” Hackett said. “Self-
lessness is a way I would describe 
him. He got thousands of e-mails, 
most of them from people who 
served in war with him, urging 
him to soldier through this.

“He and I had deep conver-

sations about it, and I was con-
vinced this is a guy who will learn 
from this mistake.”

In the same meeting with 

reporters, he said he declined an 
offer for the Michigan football 
team to play a game at a neutral 
site in front of 160,000 fans.

“I thought about it,” Hack-

ett said. “But I don’t think that’s 
going to be the kind of game you’ll 
want to see.”

One of his biggest decisions has 

been signing a new apparel con-
tract for the Athletic Department. 
After being with Adidas for the 
past eight years, Hackett chose 
to sign with Nike for a nation-
leading $169 million over 15 years 
starting in 2016.

Moving forward: It wouldn’t 

be hyperbole to say these chang-
es have reshaped the Athletic 
Department over the past 12 
months. But the biggest differ-
ence might be Hackett’s overall 
philosophy, which he elaborated 
upon during an April fireside 
chat with students. He told the 
students he doesn’t want Michi-
gan athletic events to feel “cor-
porate.”

“I don’t want to sound sarcas-

tic,” Hackett said. “What I don’t 
want is more entertainment that’s 
not football. I think that works 
in the pros, but we’re in college. 
I believe college shouldn’t be like 
the pros. It shouldn’t cost like the 
pros.”

So that’s where the Michigan 

Athletic Department stands after 
one year of Schlissel’s tenure. 
Schlissel faced a bevy of tests out 
of the gate, but he, Hackett and 
Harbaugh appear to have stabi-
lized things heading into another 
football season.

“What I’m responsible for is 

selecting good people and mak-
ing sure that we share a common 
set of values and we agree upon a 
strategy,” Schlissel said. “But it’s 
up to folks like the Interim AD 
Jim Hackett in the same way it 
would be up to the LSA dean to be 
responsible for their unit and its 
success — and to get credit when 
it’s successful.”

I

’m weighing in on University 
President Schlissel’s address 
to Greek life a bit late, but 

how and what he 
spoke about at 
the meeting is an 
example of poor 
public 
health 

communication. 
If the University 
wants to foster 
an ongoing dis-
cussion 
with 

students 
about 

unsafe drinking 
practices, 
and 

by extension our 
rates of risky and non-consensual 
sexual activities, they need to get a 
handle on this. In my public health 
risk communication course, we dis-
cuss the best way to connect with 
a given individual and population 
about health risks. The goal may be to 
make individuals more aware of risk 
or motivate them to take meaningful 
action to change their risks. There 
are also very specific rules about 
motivating and communicating with 
individuals to change their behaviors 
and ideas around alcohol use. 

Schlissel should have placed 

greater emphasis on the fact that 
this is not solely a University of 
Michigan 
Greek 
life 
problem. 

According to the Association of 
College Unions International, the 
age of the drinkers, participation 
in intercollegiate athletics, involve-
ment 
in 
student 
organizations 

where there is socializing with 
alcohol, involvement in fraterni-
ties/sororities, sex, family attitudes 
toward alcohol, experience with 
alcohol in high school and life sat-
isfaction at school all predict the 
likelihood of binge drinking.

It just so happens that Greek life 

has a higher profile on our campus 
and an increased number of prob-
lems than the rest of the under-
graduate population. The National 
College Health Assessment for the 
University reports that 65 percent 
of Greek life students do not pace 
themselves to one drink or less per 
hour (an indicator of binge drink-
ing) in comparison to 52 percent 
of the non-Greek life undergradu-
ate population. Only 45 percent of 
Greek life members chose to not 

drink at all in comparison to 60 per-
cent of the rest of the undergradu-
ate population, and only 49 percent 
of Greek life students report alter-
nating between alcohol and non-
alcohol compared to 64 percent in 
non-Greek undergraduate popula-
tion. While Greek life might have 
an amplified set of problematic 
drinking behaviors, the Univer-
sity seems to be grabbing for low-
hanging fruit by publicly chastising 
Greek life undergraduate behav-
ior. Compared to mainstream stu-
dent organizations and the general 
undergraduate population, it’s easy 
to get an extremely well organized, 
loyalty-bound and socially savvy 
group of people together if you 
threaten them with fines and sus-
pension from social events. When 
presented with the task of winning 
people over with your argument for 
change, the last thing you want to do 
is create an atmosphere of coercion.

Along with acknowledgement 

that they’re not the only ones with 
a problem, public health theory 
states that it’s important to express 
non-judgment and empathy for 
individuals’ risky health behaviors 
— especially in the case of alcohol 
use. Administrators and faculty 
should actively express under-
standing. It’s one thing to know 
that students are in a stressful, 
high-pressure peer and academic 
environment, and it’s a whole other 
thing to connect and empathize 
with that reality. Understanding 
and empathizing with alcohol use 
in this context is essential. Con-
frontation and blame is counterpro-
ductive and is more likely to make 
the individuals who are in denial 
defensive and unwilling to enter-
tain the idea of change. This also 
makes individuals who are will-
ing to change their behavior feel 
resentful and attacked.

Ultimately, all undergraduate 

students have room for improve-
ment in their alcohol use. In the 
same 2014 survey, 41 percent of 
undergraduate 
students 
report-

ed binge drinking in the last two 
weeks, and binge drinking was 
found to be positively correlated 
to an increased number of sexual 
partners, misuse of prescription 
drugs and incidents of physical 

victimization (sexual and physical 
assault). Health professionals and 
administrators must give students 
information about how they can 
change these numbers, and if stu-
dents want to change their behav-
ior, professionals must ask students 
what actions they feel good about 
taking to change the behavior. 

Schlissel also should emphasize 

and support undergraduate and 
Greek life students’ agency. Either 
Greek life and undergraduates can 
partner with the University to create 
their own solutions and remedies for 
their problem behaviors, or they can 
continue their behavior, owning the 
consequences that come with it.

Finally, we must acknowledge 

that some students will be resistant 
to changes in their drinking behav-
iors, and that this is natural, not a 
sign of more serious problems. This 
means we can allow the respectful 
dissent of certain individuals and 
still continue the dialogue and find 
common ground for change.

That said, public health research 

has found that one of the best ways 
to make individuals understand 
and make good choices surround-
ing risk behaviors is to have some-
one they feel they can identify 
closely with presenting health risk 
information. In the case of Greek 
life binge drinking, work has begun 
on having leaders from their com-
munity discuss binge drinking and 
health, but it could be done with 
greater organization and also focus 
on combating other problem out-
comes of binge drinking that need to 
be reduced, such as injury or sexual 
assault. Within the undergraduate 
population, athletic team captains, 
student 
organization 
presidents 

and resident advisors could take a 
leadership role in speaking about 
the risk factors of binge drinking 
and work with students to create a 
game plan for changing problem-
atic drinking habits.

The University prides itself on its 

collaborative environment, as well as 
being the cutting-edge in academics 
and campus life. Let’s not fall short 
when working to improve the health 
and quality of life of our students.

Addressing drinking through public health

Making a safer campus

FROM THE DAILY

L

egislators have finally laid a foundation to fix the dire state of 
sex education in Michigan with a bill that would teach sexual 
consent — its definition and application — in classrooms 

across the state. Alarmingly, the term “consent” is nowhere to be 
found in sex education laws in Michigan, making the amendment, 
formally introduced by State Rep. Tom Cochran (D–Mason) and 
State Sen. Curtis Hertel, Jr. (D–Meridian Twp.) last Tuesday, all the 
more necessary.

Sex 
education 
in 
Michigan, 
beyond 

meeting basic guidelines set forth by the 
federal and state governments, is largely 
decided 
by 
individual 
school 
districts 

and the advisory boards appointed by the 
district. These guidelines include teaching 
important issues regarding sexual contact, 
such as how to reduce risk of contracting 
sexually transmitted infections or unplanned 
pregnancy, and details of legal codes 
surrounding sexual relations. However, only 
requiring these base standards gives districts 
and teachers the opportunity to instill 
various biases toward the subject material, 
be it for religious or political reasons, leading 
education to differ from district to district. 

Further, 
by 
only 
explaining 
the 

ramifications 
of 
unprotected 
sex 
and 

continuing to emphasize abstinence-only or 
abstinence-based relationships, sex education 
in Michigan continues to perpetuate the 
status quo of either unrealistic or unsafe 
sexual relationships. Without a definition 
of consent written in the guidelines and a 
discussion about why consent is important, 
sex education in Michigan fails to foster 
behaviors that prevent dangerous sexual 
situations. This means students are left with 
a haphazard education about cultivating safe 
and fulfilling sexual relationships. Given that 
limited understanding, among other reasons, 
the prevalence of sexual assault on college 
campuses is no surprise. 

H.B. 4903, commonly called the “Yes 

Means Yes” bill, sets forth a definition of 
sexual consent as an agreement that is 
affirmative, conscious, voluntary and made 
by both parties. Lack of any of these parts 
renders an act non-consensual — silence, 
lack of resistance or a prior history of sexual 
relations do not fulfill this agreement.

With 22.5 percent of female undergraduates 

at the University reported to have experienced 
“some form of nonconsensual touching and 
kissing or oral, vaginal or anal penetration,” 
it’s clear a culture change is sorely needed. 
Though a “yes means yes” definition of 
consent may be considered extreme or 
unrealistic by some, removing ambiguities 
in sexual encounters is absolutely essential if 
sex culture in this country is to change.

That said, the wording of the bill lacks 

precision in how consent is taught by 
stipulating that the agreement is true only 
if it is made by “conscious” individuals. The 
bill needs to specify that consciousness is not 
black or white, and acknowledge that there is 
a grey area where an individual is conscious 
but impaired due to alcohol or drug use and 
therefore unable to make safe decisions. 

While the bill only covers the way consent 

is taught in Michigan’s classrooms, the new-
and-improved definition must soon appear 
in Michigan’s penal code. In the meantime, 
it is critical that this bill passes, and that 
legislators don’t allow religion, politics or 
potential awkwardness get in the way of 
ensuring a safer future for all.

Bill would add definition of consent to curriculum

“W

hatever you do, 
don’t 
linger,” 

warned the lead-

er of one of my 
student organi-
zations. “If the 
police shut down 
the party, you 
need to leave.”

Her 
advice 

was valid. Lin-
gering 
around 

a 
party 
with 

a 
police 
pres-

ence — if under 
21 — is a great 
way to end up 
with a minor in possession citation. 
However, having to scurry off at 
the first police sighting comes with 
serious costs. Friends get lost and 
separated, and some friends get left 
behind amid the chaos. Especially 
when alcohol is a factor, it’s easy to 
see how this combination of events 
could produce dangerous, sub-opti-
mal situations.

Police shutdowns of tailgates 

have become a regular fear of foot-
ball Saturday at the University. 
Sometimes this is justified — these 
parties can get out of control. But 
when students are more fearful of 
potential legal trouble than they 
are for their own and their friends’ 
safety, we’ve got to rethink our pol-
icies toward underage drinking.

There are few things that have 

thus far characterized Mark Schlis-
sel’s short tenure as University 
president more than his very pub-
lic crusade against college “party 
culture.” At the school’s first-ever 
all-Greek meeting, he warned that 
extreme party behavior devalued the 
degrees that students work so hard 
to earn. He’s not completely wrong.

Schlissel’s call to come together 

to address the problems caused 
by alcohol overconsumption is 
justified and well-deserving of 
attention. Unfortunately, his pun-
ishment-oriented approach to our 
campus party problem is far less 

commendable, and may actually 
exacerbate the problem.

New University policies allow 

administrators to call the parents of 
certain first-year students caught in 
violation of school alcohol policies 
on a “case-by-case” basis. Tattling 
on students away at school is a thin 
strategy at best.

For one thing, it doesn’t make a 

ton of sense to encourage respon-
sible behavior by taking away stu-
dents’ responsibility for their own 
actions and handing it back to Mom 
and Dad. Added to the fact that 
roughly half of students are now 
out of state, and the vast majority of 
in-state students don’t come from 
Ann Arbor or the surrounding area, 
it’s unlikely that students’ parents 
can control their child’s behavior 
remotely anyways.

At the very best, this approach 

prompts students to change only 
the behavior that could get them 
in trouble with Mom and Dad, like 
medical transport or property dam-
age. Presumably, the goal is to help 
students develop safe and healthy 
drinking habits. It’s concerning that 
these policies are essentially equat-
ing safe with not-hospitalized.

The bigger problem with these 

policies, though, is the University’s 
continued focus on enforcement, 
not education. Underage students 
already face stiff legal consequenc-
es — specifically a minor in posses-
sion citation — if caught drinking. 
Adding the threat of parental 
involvement is unlikely to provide 
an effective deterrent for a behav-
ior that has been normalized as part 
of the college experience, despite its 
legal status as a misdemeanor crime.

One look around most college cam-

puses — and even some high school 
social circles — will tell you that nei-
ther University policy nor Michigan’s 
underage drinking laws are effective 
deterrents for most minors. Accord-
ing to a 2013 survey, more than 60 
percent of those polled had broken 
that law by the end of high school.

Maybe, as some argue, we need 

stiffer penalties to keep youngsters 
away from the jungle juice. If you 
believe that, phoning home might 
make sense. But just to put into 
perspective how harshly Michi-
gan treats underage drinking, other 
examples of misdemeanor offenses 
in Michigan include lighting up 
to $1,000 worth of someone else’s 
belongings on fire and beating your 
significant other. While most teen-
age drinkers aren’t going to receive 
the same punishment as an arsonist 
or wife beater, the current law does 
put underage drinking in the same 
legal, criminal category as arson and 
wife beating.

It’s likely that taking a harsh, 

crime-and-justice 
approach 
to 

underage drinking is pushing behav-
ior to the extremes, as minors sneak 
alcohol and drink in unsupervised 
basements instead of regulated bars, 
and drink with the explicit goal of 
getting drunk. This is supported by 
the fact that minors are much more 
likely to binge drink than legal adults.

The Michigan State Senate intro-

duced a bill in May that would 
reduce first-time underage drinking 
citations from a misdemeanor crime 
to a civil infraction. It is imperative 
that this legislation becomes law.

As the rest of the state considers 

reforming detrimental underage 
drinking laws, it’s essential that the 
University encourage this effort, 
instead of instituting more pun-
ishments for students to fear and 
hide from. Instead of attempting to 
strengthen failed deterrence poli-
cies, the University should focus on 
improving existing programs like 
Stay in the Blue, and develop new 
initiatives to help students drink 
responsibly. In addition, the Uni-
versity should aggressively support 
Senate Bill 0332, recognizing it as a 
step toward a safer campus commu-
nity and better decision-making.

New York for 24 hours to see 
“Hamilton” 
off-Broadway. 

Sitting in the second row and 
being spat on by Jonathan 
Groff 
dressed 
in 
full 

monarchial garb is still one 
of the best experiences I’ve 
ever had. Thomas Jefferson 
and Alexander Hamilton’s rap 
battle is one that awill live on in 
my heart forever. “Hamilton” 
keeps the audience’s attention 
through its subtle humor and 
quickly executed lyrics and 
presenting a figure of American 
history often overshadowed by 
his presidential counterparts.

I am currently taking an 

English class titled American 
Adolescence, which focuses on 
common themes throughout 
children’s and young adult 
literature, such as revolution, 
rebellion 
and 
friendship. 

“Hamilton” is truly a story of 
America in its adolescence, 
morphing into different ideals 
and setting the precedence of 
what is to come. It speaks to 
and incites youth with ideas of 
uprising and transformation, 
and reminds the world of the 
fragility of the era. Rather than 
staying stagnant as a play about 
the past, Miranda creates a 
story that allows people to 
become deeply nostalgic for 
not only America’s history, but 

their own.

“Hamilton” makes history 

accessible 
to 
a 
younger 

generation and inspires others 
to look into their own past. 
Despite how important we 
may think we are, millions 
have lived before us and 
millions more will live after 
us. In focusing on the life of 
one man and watching his 
impact on history, it forces 
the audience to recognize its 
relationship to others and the 
influence they have on lives 
around them.

“Hamilton” ’s story is one 

that identifies the brutality of 
war, the pain of defeat and the 
glory of success. So … what is 
your story?

“I grew up in a neighborhood 

that was mostly girls and old peo-
ple,” John Hughes once said about 
his upbringing. “There weren’t 
any boys my age, so I spent a lot of 
time by myself, imagining things.”

Hughes, one of the most pro-

lific and talented moviemakers 
of the 1980s, did what no other 
director before or since has been 
able to do, even with half the same 
heart or reality: tell the stories of 
teenagers.

Let me elaborate.
In the span of years between 

1982 and 1990, John Hughes 
wrote or directed 10 films that 
still run repeatedly on TV and are 
widely beloved today. You know 
them as: Some Kind of Wonder-
ful; Sixteen Candles; Breakfast 
Club; Weird Science; Pretty in 
Pink; Ferris Bueller’s Day Off; 
Planes, Trains and Automobiles; 
Uncle Buck; Christmas Vacation; 
and Home Alone.

Think about that for a second. 

How many of those movies have 
you seen or heard about? How 
many of them can you quote line-
for-line? How many memorable 
scenes or songs immediately come 
to mind?

If Shakespeare created the 

human being, John Hughes cre-
ated the teenager. For better 
or worse, he catalogued those 
pubescent years with a genius’s 

eye for detail and a poet’s sense of 
heart. His characters were jocks, 
nerds, troublemakers and home-
coming queens. They were cyni-
cal (Cameron Frye), irresponsible 
(Uncle Buck), resourceful (Kevin 
McCallister), dedicated (Clark 
Griswold), criminal (John Bend-
er) and larger-than-life (Ferris 
Bueller). We remember them not 
as stars or icons or archetypes, 
but as unrealized versions of our-
selves.

And it all goes back to Hughes’s 

upbringing, a time of imagination 
and introspection. He quickly 
figured out that knowing people 
— knowing what they think, how 
they feel, why they behave the 
way they do — is really an act of 
imagining them as slight varia-
tions of ourselves. 

Take Andrew, Emilio Estevez’s 

character in Breakfast Club, for 
example. As a star high school 
athlete, Andrew has a differ-
ent way of thinking about things 
than, say, Brian, the class brain. 
And Andrew and Brian each have 
different ways of thinking about 
things than Allison, the girl with 
personal issues. But in Hughes’s 
films, these differences don’t mat-
ter because, as Andrew explains, 
“We’re all pretty bizarre. Some 
of us are just better at hiding it, 
that’s all.”

It’s a cliché thing to say, but 

when John Hughes died in 
2009—at the age of 59—he left 
an enormous void in the world of 

Hollywood. The greatest docu-
menter of teenage angst left 
without having taught us how to 
approach the current generation, 
without giving us a blueprint for 
telling the millennial story. And 
that’s a problem.

Of all the generations that 

have come to pass in the world, 
the millennial generation, our 
generation, is the hardest to 
connect with, the hardest to 
pin down. We come from cities, 
small rural towns and suburbs, 
from the East Coast, West Coast, 
Third Coast, from rich and from 
poor, from private schools, pub-
lic schools, boarding schools, 
charter and trade schools, from 
countries on the North Ameri-
can continent and countries 
that aren’t. As young adults 
bombarded with information 
in just about every variety and 
from every screen, we develop 
individualized, highly personal 
opinions. We love to look at our-
selves, but we hate to talk about 
ourselves. 

All this is to say that, well, 

we’re all very different from one 
another. As it stands now, there 
exists no great record of who 
we are as a generation. We don’t 
have our Breakfast Club yet; we 
don’t have our Ferris Bueller. 
Without such stories and char-
acters, we remain faceless in the 
chronicles of history.

So I ask: will the next John 

Hughes please stand up?

‘Limitless’ can’t live 
up to its full potential

By BEN ROSENSTOCK

Daily Arts Writer

CBS’s new series “Limitless” 

is the latest story to build on the 
misconception 
that 
humans 

only use 10% 
of their brains, 
and 
if 
we 

were 
able 
to 

access 
100%, 

we’d 
become 

superhuman. 
Like 
the 

eponymous 
film, and like 
other 
movies 

that utilize this 
same myth, the show rarely 
exploits the moral quandaries 
that naturally arise from the 
premise. At least the film 
“Limitless” 
and 
last 
year’s 

“Lucy” had a lot of stylish fun 
with the wacky ideas, and the 
“Limitless” pilot occasionally 
attains that sense of absurd 
entertainment. Unfortunately, 
the show seems to promise little 
to sustain an ongoing series 
past its premiere.

Jake 
McDorman 

(“Manhattan 
Love 
Story”) 

stars as Brian Finch, the basic 
equivalent to Bradley Cooper’s 
character in the film. When his 
father (Ron Rifkin, “Brothers 
and Sisters”) becomes sick, 
Brian realizes he hasn’t done 
anything in his life to make 
his dad proud. Luckily, Brian’s 
friend Eli has access to NZT, 
a drug that allows its user to 
access the entirety of the brain. 
Now Brian can solve complex 
math 
equations, 
vividly 

remember every moment of his 
life and digest huge quantities 
of information with the quickest 
of glances.

From the beginning, there 

are signs that the show won’t be 
able to match the heights of the 
movie. McDorman works fine 
as a protagonist, but he’s not 
nearly as charismatic as Cooper, 
so when he uses his powers to 
suavely show off and flirt with 
women, he’s not as amusingly 
smug. He’s also saddled with 
the most pointless, annoying 
voiceover 
since 
the 
later 

seasons of “Dexter,” explaining 
every move he makes instead 
of just allowing the viewer to 
watch it happen.

The rest of the main cast is 

mostly uninteresting. Jennifer 
Carpenter as FBI agent Rebecca 
Harris is disappointingly tame 
after her erratic performance 
on “Dexter,” and a third-act 
reveal that her late father used 
NZT fails to make her a three-
dimensional 
character. 
The 

other two agents who round out 
the cast, played by Hill Harper 
(“CSI: NY”) and Mary Elizabeth 
Mastrantonio (“The Color of 
Money”) are stock types, two 
bland agents who serve only 
to question Harris when she 
blindly trusts Brian.

At least most of the pilot burns 

through plot at an impressive 
rate. Brian becomes addicted 
to NZT, solves the murder of a 
friend, faces off against Harris 
on multiple occasions, schemes 
to move his sick father to the 
top of the liver transplant 
waiting list and meets Eddie 
Morra, 
Bradley 
Cooper’s 

character from the film. The 
episode’s kinetic pace keeps it 
entertaining until the last act, 
when Brian and Harris enter 
into a partnership that promises 
a boring procedural structure 
for upcoming episodes. As soon 
as Harris calls Brian’s abilities 
a ‘resource’ and utters the 
world ‘consultant,’ it’s clear 
the show isn’t interested in 
maintaining the fun of its first 
episode. This was all meant 
to set up a standard boring 
formulaic cop show, with the 
‘twist’ being that the consultant 
has pharmaceutically-induced 
superhuman abilities.

TV shows based on movies 

and books often struggle to 
find a way to tell a similar 
story stretched out to the 
format of an ongoing series. 
“Limitless” tries to solve that 
problem by turning the story 
into a procedural, a reliable 
way to have a new plot each 
episode to distract from the 
sluggish main narrative arc. 
Ironically, though, “Limitless” 
would improve by sticking 
more to the plot of the movie, 
having Brian do something 
new and interesting with his 
powers instead of just helping 
out another law enforcement 
agency. 
The 
ending 
of 

“Limitless” was so compelling 
because Morra acted entirely 
in self-interest, using NZT 
to indulge his delusions of 
self-grandeur and ascend to a 
position of power in the Senate. 
“Limitless” would do well to 
have its protagonist be a little 
more selfish and a little less 
noble.

‘Reborn’ a heroic but 
unnecessary effort

By DREW MARON

Daily Arts Writer

“Heroes” returns to televi-

sion for the first time in six 
years with the 13-part mini-
series 
“Heroes: 
Reborn.” 
Instead of 
re-intro-
ducing 
viewers 
to 
the 

world 
of 

“Heroes,” 
however, 
“Reborn” 
settles for 
making the 
same mistakes as its predeces-
sor.

The story picks up sev-

eral years after the events of 
“Heroes.” In the years since 
the events of the fourth season, 
those with powers (now called 
“Evos”) have revealed them-
selves to a world that has come 
to fear them. It’s a concept 
we’ve seen thousands of times 
in comics, television, and film, 
and “Reborn” doesn’t improve 
on or reinvent what “X-Men” 
and “True Blood” already 
accomplished years ago.

That 
being 
said, 
the 

series 
opening 
did 
seem 

like an interesting place to 
start for fans: the absolute 
destruction of the Primatech 
building. The fatal incident 
occurs 
at 
the 
beginning 

when, 
during 
a 
peace 

rally held by the reformed 
Primatech, 
an 
explosion 

levels 
Odessa. 
Hundreds 

are killed, including Claire 
Bennet 
(Hayden 
Panettiere, 

“Nashville”), or so we’re told. 
Mohinder 
Suresh 
(Sendhil 

Ramamurthy, “Covert Affairs”) 
has 
claimed 
responsibility, 

and things are becoming less 
and less like we remember 
them: 
invulnerable 
Claire 

dies in explosion? Flawed but 
ultimately noble Mohinder is a 
terrorist? The surprises with 
known characters were one 
of the more welcome aspects 
of “Reborn,” however, killing 
the Haitian, one of the best 
characters of the series, seems 
like the wrong move.

Another unfortunate aspect 

of the series is that like the 

original 
“Reborn” 
lacks 
a 

cohesive storyline. Instead, 
the show gives its audience 
misappropriated, 
unwanted 

new characters that confuse 
and use unearned melodrama 
in a way that devalues its 
already questionable status as 
a serious television drama.

The end product is a show 

that 
frustrates 
fans 
and 

newcomers alike, falling apart 
long before it even comes 
together.

The attempts to combine 

superhero tropes with social 
commentary in the Carlos (Ryan 
Guzman, “Step Up”) storyline 
is admirable and at least at the 
moment, the most interesting 
of the series’ additions. Creator 
Tim 
Kring 
(“Heroes”) 
and 

his fellow writers should be 
applauded for giving us a Latino 
superhero, and Carlos, a non-
Evo, could prove a fascinating 
answer to this world’s Batman.

The other storylines are less 

fruitful, to say the least. Tommy 
(Robbie Kay, “Once Upon A 
Time”) does feel pleasantly 
old-fashioned, something like 
an homage to the teen angst 
of classic Spiderman comics. 

Unfortunately, his home and 
high school life feel much less 
fleshed out than Claire’s did 
back in 2006.

We’re also introduced to 

Luke (Zachary Levi, “Thor: The 
Dark World”) and Joanna (Judi 
Shekoni, 
“Backstrom”) 
who 

lost their son in Odessa and are 
now indiscriminately killing 
every Evo they can find. It’s an 
incredibly disturbing story and 
one that does create interesting 
and 
darkly 
understandable 

villains, but it seems like we 
needed more than just a lost 
son before having the couple go 
full-on “Natural Born Killers.”

But the single biggest sin has 

to be the Kiko story. Her power, 
the ability to transport between 
the real world and a video 
game, is a cool idea, if it had 
been done right. Unfortunately, 
here 
it 
just 
feels 
out 
of 

place, 
under-developed, 
and 

incredibly cartoonish in a show 
whose melodrama constantly 
undermines its aims at making 
quality drama.

We 
seem 
to 
have 
an 

unquenchable 
desire 
for 

superheroes. 
There 
is 

undeniable evidence in comics, 
film, and television that the 
genre can sustain a certain 
level of prestige. “Marvel’s 
Daredevil,” for instance, proved 
to have more in common with 
“The French Connection” than 
the city-destroying madness 
and pretentiousness of “Man 
of Steel.” “Reborn,” however, 
falls far below the genre’s best, 
making the return of “Heroes” 
feel 
neither 
deserved 
nor 

needed.

COMMUNITY CULTURE NOTEBOOK
Get off Instagram 
and enjoy your life

Destroying the 

ability to live in the 
moment, one Insta 

at a time

By BAILEY KADIAN

Daily Arts Writer

My sisters have been tell-

ing me to get an Instagram for 
years.

But I refuse.
This isn’t some subtle indica-

tor of being “above” the age of 
social media, or my acting com-
pletely naïve to it; I just think 
pictures have become the cen-
ter of experiences. People need 
to take pictures while going out 
and doing something exciting.

While traveling or visiting 

friends or celebrating holidays, 
it’s fun to take pictures. And 
it’s necessary. We live in age 
where documentation is valued 
and is easily accomplished. I’m 
not denying what a gift photog-
raphy is, but it has become an 
obsession.

There is an obvious differ-

ence between taking pictures 
to remember, and engaging in a 
new experience just so you can 
have a bunch of stuff to post 
and share. These pictures seem 
less about remembering events; 
they are the event itself.

If you can’t imagine a week-

end spent doing something 
exciting without an album of 
pictures, you have likely missed 
the moment entirely. It’s no 
wonder live performances have 
such an effect on people. For 
two or three hours, the theater 
asks that you put your phones 
away and just allow yourself to 
enjoy the show. You aren’t dis-
tracted by the interruption of a 
camera, nagging you to docu-
ment every little thing you see.

There’s value to an experi-

ence where you allow your mind 
to be fully engaged. Memories 
are valuable, but they can’t be 
formed through taking a thou-
sand pictures just to remember 
something. Therein lies the 
irony. You want to remember 
what an exciting thing you saw 
or did. So you take pictures, 
again and again, to the point 

where the thing you’re trying to 
remember, you’re actually for-
getting thanks to your distrac-
tion.

Let yourself be fully engaged 

in the experiences that sur-
round you. It’s become an activ-
ity for people to sit around and 
take pictures of everything in 
sight and by the time that exces-
sively long task is finished, the 
thrill and excitement of the 
event itself has likely dwindled.

I don’t want to scroll through 

all my photos and see every part 
of my life laid out. I want to be 
able to see a few snapshots of 
moments that I could talk end-
lessly about. So no, I don’t have 
countless pictures from every 
life event I’ve ever experienced. 
Nor will I be able to provide 
that for friends and family who 
want to follow me in a picture 
play-by-play.

But I’ll have my memory. And 

if someone asks about it, I’d be 
happy to talk endlessly about 
everything I saw, because I can 
guarantee you, the picture can’t 
speak for itself. You must be 
the one to do it.

FILM REVIEW
‘Intern’ ’s mature look 
at office friendship

By NOAH COHEN

Daily Arts Writer

Who knew Robert De Niro 

and Anne Hathaway still had this 
movie in them? De Niro (“Taxi 
Driver”) plays 
Ben Whittak-
er, a cute old 
man looking to 
re-engage with 
a brave new 
world; 
Anne 

Hathaway 
(“The 
Devil 

Wears Prada”) plays Jules Ostin, 
a 30-year-old corporate people-
person, beset on all sides by the 
pressures of an environment that 
calls for 30 hours in a day. The 
magnetism of these two won-
derful human beings bleeds into 
every aspect of the movie, shim-
mering over the movie’s molasses 
plot and dumbed-down dialogue 
until this otherwise forgettable 
comedy glows with peace and 
warmth. The two of them conjure 
a universe where people come 
before business.

We know De Niro as a man 

of hardness, but he plays soft-
ness so convincingly, the audi-
ence wonders if maybe De Niro 
was really a sweetheart all along. 
Through all those years of play-
ing the antagonist, no one ever 
gave him a chance to be gentle. 
This was probably his last chance, 
and he knocks it out of the park. 
From start to finish, “The Intern” 
is a conspiracy to make us fall in 
love with Robert De Niro all over 
again.

“The Intern” falls perfectly 

into the golden center of Hatha-
way movies, more serious than 
“Ella Enchanted” or her more 
forgettable rom-coms, less seri-
ous than “The Dark Knight 
Rises” or “Les Miserables.” “The 
Intern” fits snugly between “The 
Princess Diaries” and “The Devil 
Wears Prada.” Hathaway plays 
the suffer-smiling people-person 
as an island in an ocean of person-
al and bureaucratic turmoil. De 
Niro paddles his little boat up to 
her island to dock, and it’s exactly 
what both of them need.

“The Intern” features a more 

benevolent 
portrayal 
by 
De 

Niro. He draws the directionless 
to him, and the cast, fraught 
with 20-somethings, exchange 

competencies with him with 
remarkable 
ease 
in 
mutual 

learning experiences. The best 
emotional comedy flows with 
unnoticed direction – friction 
that could have been, but wasn’t. 
“The 
Intern” 
navigates 
the 

glaciers of its terrain marvelously. 
Hathaway spends a large part 
of the movie looking for a CEO, 
and the audience can’t help but 
imagine De Niro climactically 
filling this role. The movie is 
smarter than the audience here; 
it doesn’t give us what we think 
we want. It gives us De Niro as the 
unassuming emotional CEO, who 
offers guidance when prompted, 
but never does anything to take 
power away from Hathaway. In 
many ways, this is the movie our 
decade has been waiting for.

Contrary 
to 
the 
trailer, 

Hathaway is the protagonist, not 
De Niro. The dialogue isn’t perfect, 
but one major win is its fearlessness 
with the F-word. Feminism isn’t 
leveraged as a prop. Instead, we 
get a gentle reminder to take a step 
back and ask ourselves how gender 
politics are working in context, 
and what we would feel if we were 

in Hathaway’s shoes.

Though young men get the 

narrative shaft in this movie, 
it’s nice that we, the protagonist 
princes of Hollywood, can get 
the experience of being left-
of-center-stage 
without 
undue 

scolding. The trailer utterly fails 
here. Sure, there’s the one scene 
where 
Hathaway 
compares 

her 
20-something 
employees 

unfavorably to De Niro, but that’s 
the worst scene in the movie. 
Judgement 
and 
interpersonal 

criticism, thankfully, do not pierce 
to the gooey heart of this comedy.

Orbiting that gooey center 

are several fleshy minor arcs. 
Zack 
Pearlman 
(“Mulaney”), 

newcomer Christina Scherer and 
“Workaholics” stars Adam DeVine 
and Anders Holm each get time 
in the sun as the people whose 
lives revolve around Hathaway’s. 
De Niro handles each with care. 
DeVine rambunctiously lowers 
the cast’s mean IQ, but maybe the 
movie needed that.

This 
movie’s 
trailer 
was 

dreadful, 
totally 
overlooking 

the centrality of Hathaway and 
the warmth of intergenerational 
friendship. The ill-toned hype 
will punish it at the box-office and 
leave it an underrated gem in the 
annals of IMDB.

It’s true that the ending is a bit 

heavyhanded. This is a comedy 
that teaches to forgive, and some 
audience members will disagree 
with it. But if you’re the kind 
of person who can sidestep the 
political dance, you’ll come back 
to this movie more than once, and 
you’ll like it more each time.

BOOK REVIEW
Fascinating ‘Earth’ 

By SOPHIA KAUFMAN

Daily Arts Writer

There is no doubt that the 

Holocaust was one of the blood-
iest events in 
the 
history 

of the West-
ern 
world. 

But in “Black 
Earth: 
The 

Holocaust as 
History 
and 

Warning,” 
Yale 
Prof. 

Timothy Sny-
der 
argues 

that to rele-
gate the Holo-
caust to the 
context of our 
history class-
es is to do our-
selves a great disservice, and a 
potentially dangerous one. He 
argues, using sources from a 
variety of languages, that we 
need to delve deeper into the 
causes of the Holocaust, espe-
cially Hitler’s worldview and 
the role that ecological panic 
and the destruction of state-
hood played.

Snyder begins in Hitler’s 

mind. He fleshes out Hit-
ler’s beliefs in detail, going far 
beyond the idea that Hitler 
hated Jews to claim that Hitler 
didn’t consider Jewish people, 
along with Soviets and Ukrai-
nians, part of the human race. 
He explains that Hitler’s preoc-
cupation was about the survival 
of Germans and the cleansing of 
the land by the extermination 
of Jews, as he conflated poli-
tics and the natural order. This 

comes back again in his conclu-
sion — Snyder points out that 
we as a current society have 
already begun to adopt the cat-
astrophism so prevalent in Hit-
ler’s mind. He reminds us of the 
need for a separation between 
science and politics.

Snyder’s explanation of Hit-

ler’s beliefs and perspective are 
riveting, but he also tends to 
focus on details, like the roles 
of Polish politics and Palestine, 
that, while interesting, don’t 
feel immediately necessary to 
understanding the Holocaust. 
It’s at parts like these where 
Snyder gets caught up in politi-
cal theory details that aren’t 
necessary for the average read-
er; much more relevant are the 
parts in which he deconstructs 
popular Holocaust rhetoric and 
debunks myths about Nazis and 
concentration camps. In one of 
the most fascinating chapters, 
he unpacks the significance of 
Auschwitz, what it really was 
and what it has become in our 
current discourse. But while 
thorough knowledge of Euro-
pean history and the World 
Wars is presumed in most of 
this book, and though the heavy 
academic rhetoric can be dense, 
it’s almost always clear.

As with any true story, the 

personal accounts leap out from 
the page, striking the sympa-
thetic chords in our hearts. 
We’re familiar with not only 
the horror stories that have 
come from the weary mouths 
of survivors, but also stories 
of improbable, miraculous life 
in the face of almost certain 
death, and stories of those few 

who braced their backs against 
the tide and reached out their 
hands to help.

But Snyder warns we must not 

let ourselves fall into this pattern 
of those emotions we’re used to 
feeling. We can’t just bear witness 
to these stories and let ourselves 
get caught up in the pathos. We 
have to understand them in their 
complexity.

Snyder reminds us that for a 

long time, the study of history was 
dry; it was about facts and figures 
and the heroes who won the wars. 
Then there was a cultural shift, 
and we started caring more about 
the three-dimensional stories — 
about the people who had been 
relegated to the footnotes, if men-
tioned at all. But caring about the 
experiences, though important, 
can’t take the place of understand-
ing.

The idea that something like the 

Holocaust could happen again is 
terrifying and feels impossible, but 
Snyder argues it wasn’t just a phe-
nomenon. It wasn’t only a hideous 
combination of time and space and 
a madman who wielded hypnotiz-
ing rhetoric. It really could happen 
again — especially if we fail to rec-
ognize the warning signs.

Kalis realizing potential, 
appreciating every minute

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

This past summer, during the 

conditioning 
program 
before 

his 
redshirt 
junior 
season, 

Michigan offensive guard Kyle 
Kalis thought to himself. He had 
shown potential as a five-star 
recruit out of Lakewood, Ohio. 
But in the two seasons he had 
spent on Michigan’s inconsistent 
offensive line, the Wolverines 
had finished 12-13.

And then he told himself, “I’m 

going to make this year the year I 
need to have to go where I want 
to go.”

Everything has come together 

for Kalis since then.

Another moment this summer 

fed into his resurgence. Kalis was 
working out in Michigan’s weight 
room early in the morning when 
Rick Finotti, his football coach at 
St. Edward (Ohio) High School, 
walked in to say hello. Finotti 
was 
tremendously 
successful 

at St. Edward, going 62-15 over 
six seasons with two state 
championships, one in Kalis’ 
junior season.

The day Kalis saw Rick Finotti 

in Ann Arbor, Finotti interviewed 
for the director of football 
operations job under Michigan 
coach Jim Harbaugh. Later that 
day, Kalis learned Finotti got the 
job, and suddenly he had one of 
his mentors with him.

Kalis also became very close 

with Finotti’s family. He was best 
friends with Finotti’s son and 
estimated that he spent the night 
at their house three to four times 
per week.

On the field, Kalis made big 

strides under the new coaching 
staff in the offseason. He came 
out of St. Edward as a U.S. Army 
All-American, and he arrived at 

Michigan after decommitting 
from Ohio State amid NCAA 
sanctions.

He started nine games in his 

redshirt freshman season, but 
just seven last year. As part of an 
offensive line that took criticism 
as one of the worst in the Big Ten, 
Kalis struggled with consistency.

“It’s one of those things where 

the past couple years as I’ve been 
playing, we’ve been doing good 
things as an O-line, we’ve played 
well the past couple years, we just 
weren’t playing 11-man football,” 
Kalis said. “It was hard to single 
out somebody. It was hard to give 
a group credit when everyone 
wasn’t on the same page. But on 
the flip side, it does feel nice to 
start getting some recognition for 
what I’ve been doing.”

He has started all four games 

this season at right guard on a 
rejuvenated offensive line for 
the 
22nd-ranked 
Wolverines. 

Michigan has rushed for more 
than 200 yards per game so far.

And after facing his share of 

struggles, 
Kalis 
is 

enjoying 
every minute.

“I’ve 

always 
had 

fun — I would 
have quit if I 
wasn’t having 
fun 
— 
but 

having 
the 

success like we are, that’s the fun 
you’re supposed to be having,” he 
said. “The feelings and emotions 
that we’ve been having these past 
couple weeks, that’s the kind of 
fun you’re supposed to be having.

“It’s always been fun, no 

matter what anybody says. It’s 
just more fun.”

Part of Kalis’ improvement 

comes 
from 
new 
coaches, 

namely Harbaugh and offensive 
coordinator Tim Drevno, who 
have brought the best work ethic 
and talent out of him. Part of it 
comes from playing on a better 
overall 
offensive 
line, 
with 

three other fourth- or fifth-year 
players.

But a big part of it, too, comes 

from a personal 
change: 
With 

two 
years 

left, Kalis has 
simplified 
things 
and 

begun to take 
ownership of his 
success.

“Lately, 

for 
whatever 

reason, I’ve been playing football 
for the reason that I started 
playing football,” Kalis said. 
“And that’s because I like to be 
physical, I like to hit people, 
that’s fun for me. But at the same 
time, you want to do it in a way 
where you’re successful, and in 
a way where people are going to 
say, ‘Wow. We want to do it like 
that guy.’ ”

Kalis admitted that he had 

to grow up, a process that came 
with 
experience. 
He 
always 

had the physical talent and the 
intensity. His growth has been 
about harnessing it and using it 
to help the offensive line. As a 
veteran, part of the growing-up 
process was becoming a reliable 
leader in the offseason.

Kalis also admitted that he 

was a “wild dude” when he 
arrived at Michigan, and that 
showed up on the field. He still 
is, to some extent — it’s almost a 
prerequisite when you sign up to 
play football.

But this year, he’s using that 

wildness to his advantage. He’s 
using it to spring a block for junior 
running back De’Veon Smith on 
his 60-yard touchdown run, and 
then to run toward the end zone 
to celebrate with Smith.

“I’ve 
never 
dialed 
(the 

intensity) back,” Kalis said. “I’ve 
been playing more relaxed, and 
I don’t think so much. That’s the 
key — you just gotta learn how to 
control it and filter it and then use 
it when you need it.”

‘M’ enjoys strong 
outing in Illinois

By MIKE GRIFFIN

Daily Sports Writer

One week after a third-

place finish at the Inverness 
Intercollegiate, 
the 
Michigan 

men’s golf team continued its 
fall schedule with a trip to 
Glencoe, Illinois, for the Windon 
Memorial Classic.

Monday, 
the 
Wolverines 

placed second out of 14 teams, 
improving on their third-place 
finish last season. Michigan was 
carried by three outstanding 
performances: sophomore Kyle 
Mueller and freshman Nick 
Carlson tied for third and senior 
Chris O’Neill came in ninth.

Mueller sealed his third-place 

finish with an excellent second 
round in which he shot a five-
under 67. After a record-breaking 
freshman campaign that ended 
in a trip to the NCAA Regionals, 
followed 
by 
his 
exceptional 

performance 
Sunday 
and 

Monday, he has proven himself to 
be a team leader.

Only one month into his 

sophomore 
year, 
Mueller 

continued 
his 
steady 

improvement over the course 
of the fall season. After starting 
the year with an underwhelming 
round at the Gopher Invitational 
in Minnesota, he finished second 
at the Inverness Intercollegiate 
last weekend — the Wolverines’ 
best-ever finish at the event. 

“I played really well this 

week,” Mueller said. “I hit the 
ball great all week, (but) just 
struggled with putting today. 
I know what I need to work on 
for (The MacKenzie tournament 
next weekend). My ball striking 
has been great the past two 
weeks. I just need to be able to 
convert the birdie putts.”

After coming off a one-

over par performance at last 
weekend, Carlson also played a 
part in Michigan’s second-place 
finish. He finished the first day 
of competition tied for 12th, but 
rebounded 
exceptionally 
on 

the final day of the tournament. 
Monday, he posted a 69, the 
third-best final round out of 
the top 12 golfers, and tied with 
Mueller for third place overall. 
Despite his success, the true 
freshman was hesitant to praise 
his performance.

“I managed to limit my 

mistakes and miss in the right 
place when I did miss,” Carlson 
said. “My game was so-so, but I 
put the ball in the hole, and that’s 
what’s important. The team 
played solid. It could have been 
a better week for all of us, but 
we have a lot to take from this, 
confidence and things to build on 
for the rest of the season.”

Meanwhile, 
Purdue 
posed 

the greatest challenge for the 
Wolverines. 
After 
a 
fourth-

place finish at the Inverness 
Intercollegiate, the Boilermakers 
redeemed themselves with a team 
win. Despite being overpowered 
to some extent, Michigan coach 
Chris Whitten was proud of his 
team’s performance and lauded 
his three top producers.

“O’Neill and Mueller had 

good weeks again, and they are 
leading with their scoring for 
sure,” Whitten said. “It’s great 
having two anchors in the back 
of the lineup who will compete 
hard every time out. Nick Carlson 
has given us a spark too. I just 
hoped he would adjust to the 
college game and manage his 
responsibilities well for the first 
month, so for him to have a high 
finish like this is great. He should 
take a lot of confidence from this 
week.”

Training journalists in the 
newsroom, not classroom

By LEV FACHER

Managing Editor

On a recent Monday, The 

Michigan Daily, in its weekly 
sports insert, ran a cover photo 
taken by a dual-degree student 
working on one degree through 
the School of Art & Design 
and another in biopsychology, 
cognition and neuroscience. The 
game story below it was written 
by a Business student, and the 
byline below the SportsMonday 
column belonged to an editor who 
happens to also study economics.

Glance around the rest of any 

given edition of the Daily and 
you’ll see the same trend: The 
University’s aspiring journalists 
are spending their classroom time 
studying anything but journalism.

That’s the way things have 

been 
since 
the 
University 

stopped offering a journalism 
B.A. decades ago. The decision 
didn’t slow down the Daily, 
however. At a school that offers 
no formal journalism education, 
the newspaper has taken it upon 
itself to provide that education, 
informally and experientially.

Perhaps fittingly, one man who 

understands the paper’s knack for 
training successful professionals 
better than most is neither a 
University nor a Daily alumnus. 
Nonetheless, John Lowe, who 
recently retired as the Detroit 
Tigers beat writer for the Detroit 
Free Press after 29 years covering 
the team, has spent as much time 
at 420 Maynard as many current 
and former Daily staffers.

Sunday 
afternoons 
and 

evenings during the baseball 
offseason, Lowe would join the 
paper’s Sports section for its 
weekly meeting, patiently sit 
through a lengthy and often inane 
round of “icebreakers,” then 
briefly address the assembled 
staff, frequently offering pearls of 
wisdom that remain with alumni 
throughout 
their 
careers, 
in 

journalism or otherwise.

“John 
always 
asked,” 

remembered Tim Rohan, the 2011 

managing sports editor, “ ‘What’s 
the first thing you’d tell your 
college roommate when you come 
back from the game?’ ”

That concept stuck around, 

Rohan said.

Lowe’s 
presence 
and 

mentorship, however, sum up 
the Daily’s spirit better than just 
a brief advice tidbit after a staff 
meeting. Lowe would often stick 
around late into the evening, 
available for edits and advice, 
but never solicitous. If a writer 
wanted edits from Lowe, he’d be 
sitting on a couch in the back of 
the newsroom. If not, there were 
no hard feelings.

Lowe still remembers the first 

time he showed up at the Daily, at 
the invitation of former managing 
sports editor and then-Free Press 
intern Nick Cotsonika, a current 
editor at that paper and a former 
Yahoo! hockey writer.

“I was going to turn 40 in 

1999,” Lowe said. “The only 
reason I mention that is that’s 
the age when you’re qualified to 
be a mentor. As I was in my late 
30s, I was greatly enjoying my 
career, but I was also starting to 
get this urge to work with young 
writers.”

Cotsonika could never have 

envisioned 
the 
phenomenon 

Lowe’s presence would become. 
He reached a full generation of 
Daily 
up-and-comers, 
joining 

the paper on a regular basis 
beginning at the Sunday Sports 
meeting on January 24, 1999, and 
extending through October 2014.

Lowe was immediately struck 

by the newsroom atmosphere, 
the dedication and, above all else, 
the fact that the students were 
doing everything.

“I would just say that of the 

many schools I have been to, 
what I feel definitely sets the 
Daily apart is, among other 
things, the thoroughness of the 
editing process,” Lowe said. 

Cotsonika’s 
innocent 

suggestion 
worked 
out 
well 

for the man at the end of that 
editing process in 1999, Rick 

Freeman, who spent more than 
a decade at the New York offices 
of the Associated Press before 
transitioning into a gig as a copy 
editor at Al Jazeera America.

“My memory of (Lowe’s first 

visit) evades me, because it just 
seemed at the time that this guy 
I knew who was a very good beat 
writer for the ‘Freep’ was like, 
‘Hey, can I come by and talk to 
your staff?’ ” Freeman recalled. 
“It wasn’t very formal at all.”

The flexible structure, both 

in Lowe’s visits and in the 
paper’s organization, often paid 
dividends.

“Knowing that the Daily was 

our only outlet to getting into the 
field, you had to pour your entire 
self into it,” Rohan said, calling 
his experience at the Daily a 
“real education.”

The time Lowe spent at the 

Daily, immensely valuable in 
and of itself, also encapsulates 
the spirit of the paper and its 
self-reliance. 
Alumni 
teach 

older students. Older students 
teach younger students. Younger 
students teach one another.

When there are no extra 

resources to lean on, leaning on 
friends never hurts.

“I realized I can figure it out 

on my own, and that’s the most 
fun part,” Rohan said. “It became 
like a competition. You’re there 
with friends, and you’re like, ‘Oh, 
man, Mike wrote a great game 
story last week.’ You feel like you 
have to try to beat him.”

The camaraderie fosters a 

sense of territorialism, Freeman 
said — the sense that the Daily 
is the students’ responsibility, 
their domicile. That sense is alive 
and well in 2015, and isn’t going 
anywhere.

“People are always surprised 

to learn that Michigan doesn’t 
have 
a 
journalism 
school, 

because there are a ton of us who 
majored in Daily,” Freeman said. 
“It always feels good to say, ‘No, 
I was a history major.’ It’s always 
fun to see how surprised people 
are.”

For Henry Poggi, switch to 
offense was a family affair

By MAX COHEN

Managing Sports Editor

In the minutes before the 

Michigan football team began 
its rout of Brigham Young this 
weekend, an unfamiliar face 
flashed across the Michigan 
Stadium video boards as an 
offensive starter. He had been 
a defensive lineman as recently 
as last season, but now he would 
be blocking on the other side of 
the ball.

Henry Poggi never expected 

to be running out of the tunnel 
as an offensive starter for 
the Wolverines. The redshirt 
sophomore arrived on campus 
before the 2013 season as a blue-
chip defensive line prospect, 
a cornerstone of a Michigan 
recruiting class that was ranked 
sixth in the nation by ESPN.

The arc of his career did not 

go as planned. The 6-foot-4, 
273-pound 
Poggi 
redshirted 

his freshman year and played 
in just six games during his 
second season. The arrival of 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 
this past offseason offered the 
opportunity for a fresh start, 
but that, too, threw a wrench in 
Poggi’s career.

Soon after Harbaugh’s arrival, 

the new coach told Poggi that 
he wanted him to play on both 
sides of the ball as a fullback/
tight end hybrid during spring 
practice. Poggi was initially 
disappointed. He had played a 
similar position in high school, 
but did not anticipate the same 
task in college.

So Poggi did what he often 

does in times of need: He called 
his father, Biff.

Biff Poggi is different from 

most 
fathers 
of 
Michigan 

football players — he is a coach 
himself. The elder Poggi has 
led the Gilman School football 
team in Baltimore for more than 
a decade.

The Greyhounds have been 

a powerhouse throughout his 
tenure, entering this season as 
the No. 3 team in USA Today’s 
Northeast regional preseason 
football rankings. Poggi and his 
two older brothers played for 
their father.

The 
coaching 
philosophy 

of Biff Poggi and his coaching 
staff, as documented in the 
book 
“Season 
of 
Life,” 
by 

Jeffrey Marx, is one in which 
nurture 
takes 
precedence 

over screaming, and kindness 
overrules it all. Those guidelines 
were not always applicable to 
the coach’s son.

“We’d 
be 
having 
a 
bad 

practice, and instead of yelling 
at our team, he’d just kind of yell 
at me,” Henry Poggi said.

Despite the extra flak, Poggi 

said that he would not trade 
the experience of playing for 
his father for the world. It was 
natural, then, that he called Biff 
Poggi to discuss his position 
change.

Even 
before 
the 
phone 

call, both Poggis were aware 
of Harbaugh’s past success 
at 
moving 

players 
around 
the 

field. 
Seattle 

Seahawks 
cornerback 
Richard 
Sherman, 
widely 
considered 
the 
best 

cornerback 
in the NFL, had played wide 
receiver 
before 
Harbaugh 

switched 
his 
position 
at 

Stanford. And Harbaugh told 
Poggi 
about 
San 
Francisco 

49ers fullback Bruce Miller — 
a defensive lineman in college 
who became a second-team All-
Pro fullback under Harbaugh in 
San Francisco.

By the end of his conversation 

with 
his 
father 
about 
the 

possible position change, Poggi 
was sold. He realized that he 
trusted his new coach.

“Pretty much whatever he 

says, I think he knows a little bit 
more about football than me,” 
Poggi said. “So if he thinks I’ll 
do well there, I was all for it.”

Eventually, before the start of 

fall camp, Harbaugh told Poggi 
that he wanted him to play 
offense full time. He felt it was 
a disservice to Poggi to play him 
both ways, because he wasn’t 
progressing as well as he would 
if he focused on only one spot.

So far, Harbaugh’s experiment 

has been successful. Poggi has 
played consistently enough to 
see the field on a regular basis.

Describing his role is a 

different matter. Even Poggi 
himself doesn’t know exactly 
what to call his position. There 
are plays when he lines up in 
the backfield as a fullback, and 
other plays when he lines up as 
a tight end.

“Kind of like an H-back … 

fullback, tight end, I kind of 
play all three,” Poggi said. “I 

don’t 
really 

know what to 
call it. H-back 
is probably the 
best thing.”

Whatever 

position 
he 

was 
playing, 

Poggi 
made 

the 
first 

reception 
of 

his career on 

the first play from scrimmage 
in Saturday’s game. It was no 
sight to behold — he fell to the 
ground with the ball in his 
clutches when there was open 
field in front of him — but the 
two-yard gain still represented 
a milestone, one he never would 
have been able to earn as a 
defensive lineman.

There are times when Poggi 

misses his defensive lineman 
friends, with whom he spent 
the first two years of his career. 
Now, he seeks advice from fifth-
year senior Joe Kerridge — who, 
Poggi jokes, is old enough to be a 
coach (Kerridge is 23 years old).

There’s always his dad, too. 

Poggi says they talk every 
day, even when there aren’t 
pressing position changes at 
hand. Despite his high school 
coaching schedule, Biff Poggi 
has made it to two of Michigan’s 
three home games this season.

Poggi will return to his 

home state this weekend, when 
the Wolverines travel to play 
Maryland. He expects at least 
18 of his family members and 
friends to be in attendance, 
and a few of his former high 

school teammates play for the 
Terrapins.

They will see the new version 

of Poggi, the one who still gets to 
“smash skulls,” but in a different 
fashion. Poggi is under no 
illusion that his transformation 
is complete, and he said that he 
needs to work on both catching 
the ball and moving around it, 
instead of toward it.

“My biggest thing coming 

in here was I wanted to do 
whatever 
I 
could 
to 
help 

Michigan win, no matter what 
my role was,” Poggi said.

His position change, however 

little he expected it, provides 
him that opportunity. Serving 
as the latest example of a 
successful Harbaugh position 
change would be a nice bonus.

The rise of ‘M’ women’s athletics

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

In the October 16, 1973, edition 

of The Michigan Daily, a box 
no bigger than one square inch 
represented the change of the 
Michigan Athletic Department 
forever.

“Oops!” 
the 
header 
read. 

“Michigan’s women’s field hockey 
team bowed to Western Michigan 
last night in Kalamazoo, 2-0. 
Michigan’s coach was proud with 
her team’s performance due to 
the superlative competition.”

Eight days later, a Daily sports 

writer wrote a seven-paragraph 
story in the bottom-left corner 
of page six. “Michigan coach 
Phyllis Weikart said she though 
(sic) her team might have been 
a little overconfident, and when 
they fell behind, just couldn’t get 
it together.”

Throughout the past 125 years, 

both Michigan sports and the 
Daily have been overcome by 
change. And while both Michigan 
women’s sports and the Daily’s 
coverage have come a long way 
since then, those early days were 
the beginning of the movement.

In 1972, the United States 

passed Title IX of the Education 
Amendment 
Act, 
comprised 

of the 37 words that would 
irreversibly change the nature 
of college athletics: “No person 
in the United States shall, on 
the basis of sex, be excluded 
from participation in, be denied 
the benefits of, or be subjected 
to 
discrimination 
under 
any 

education program or activity 
receiving 
Federal 
financial 

assistance.”

Though schools were slow 

to enforce the law at first, those 
words 
laid 
the 
foundation. 

The 
next 
year, 
University 

President 
Robben 
Fleming 

created the Committee to Study 
Intercollegiate 
Athletics 
for 

Women. The committee wrote 
a report on women’s athletics, 
prompting Michigan to begin 
competition 
in 
the 
1973-74 

season in six varsity women’s 

sports: 
basketball, 
volleyball, 

tennis, swimming and diving, 
synchronized 
swimming 
and 

field hockey.

That year was merely a starting 

point: The field hockey team went 
1-3-1, the volleyball team 7-9 and 
the basketball team 3-8. 

The off-field appearance were 

even less promising. The women’s 
teams enjoyed far fewer resources 
than the men: no scholarships, 
no practice uniforms, no top-
notch facilities. They paid their 
way as walk-ons, wore their own 
T-shirts and shorts and played 
wherever they could find space.

With progress slow at first, one 

might have wondered how long it 
would take for Title IX to create 
real change. That was until 1978, 
when up the road in East Lansing, 
a new figure in the women’s 
sports movement began to make 
headlines: Carol Hutchins.

* * *

Hutchins, who is still the head 

coach of the Michigan softball 
team, has been a pioneer in the 
process of legitimizing women’s 
sports from the outset. She is 
now known as one of the leading 
figures in a successful movement. 
Back in 1978, she was just a player 
on the Michigan State women’s 
basketball and softball teams.

The previous season, Michigan 

State’s 
Athletic 
Department 

allocated 
$776,000 
to 
men’s 

sports but less than $85,000 to 
women’s athletics.

So Hutchins did something 

about it. She and her teammates 
sued the university before the 
federal Office of Civil Rights. The 
court ordered universities to stop 
discriminating against athletes 
and teams on the basis of gender.

In the same season when 

Hutchins’ team brought forth the 
suit, Michigan started its softball 
program, along with women’s 
golf and women’s track and 
field, bringing the total to nine 
women’s sports, compared to the 
12 it has today.

The softball team debuted on 

April 8, 1978, with a 7-2 win over 
Northwestern. Its home opener 
was two days later against Grand 
Valley State, another 1-0 win. 

Support was slow at first — as 

the Daily wrote, “There were 
no stands and only a handful of 
fans, but that didn’t bother the 
woman’s (sic) softball team, the 
newest addition to the Michigan 
sports scene.”

But the Daily still covered it. 

“Ferry Field came alive as the 
Maize and Blue fast-pitch squad 
pulled out an exciting 1-0 victory 
over Grand Valley State College,” 
sports writer Dan Perrin wrote.

Five years later, Hutchins 

was an assistant coach for the 
Michigan softball team, and two 
years after that, she took the head 
coaching job.

By that time, the team was on 

its way to becoming one of the 
Daily’s most prominent spring 
sports storylines. After almost 
two weeks on the road, the 
Wolverines opened at home on 
April 3, 1985, losing both games of 
a doubleheader to Toledo.

“We 
don’t 
execute 
with 

runners on base,” Hutchins told 
the Daily after the games. “We 
just don’t bring them in … I just 
don’t think our team came out 
there to win today.”

Today, after 38 years, the 

Michigan softball team has never 
had a losing record, a model 
of consistency not just for the 
University’s women’s sports but 
for all sports on a national level. 
Hutchins has led the team for 31 
of its 38 years of existence.

The days of only Daily coverage 

didn’t 
last. 
The 
Wolverines 

eventually went national.

* * *

The early days of women’s 

sports paved the way for a slew of 
memorable moments in Michigan 
women’s athletics. In 2001, the 
Wolverines took home their first 
women’s national championship 
in field hockey. The next day, 
Michigan made Page 1A of 
the Daily. “Field hockey team 

wins title,” the headline read, 
above a big photo of the three 
captains holding the national 
championship trophy.

The Daily sent a sports writer 

to Kent, Ohio, for the day’s top 
story.

“Years 
from 
now, 
people 

won’t remember that yesterday 
the Michigan field hockey team 
played the consensus No. 1 
team in the country,” Bob Hunt 
wrote. “They won’t remember 
that its opponent had six senior 
starters. They won’t remember 
that its opponent had beaten the 
Wolverines just two years earlier 
in the same game.

“But they will remember that 

these women were the leaders 
and best.”

Indeed, women’s sports had 

come a long way.

“I’m happy to bring another 

one home for the Wolverines,” 
Michigan field hockey coach 
Marcia Pankratz told the Daily. 
“Men’s 
programs, 
women’s 

programs, revenue, non-revenue, 
it doesn’t matter. We’re just 
really proud to be a part of the 
University.”

Four years later, the softball 

team 
joined 
the 
club 
by 

becoming the first team east 
of the Mississippi River to win 
the national championship. The 
Daily covered it with a special 
section in the summer edition, 
with sports writer Scott Bell and 
photographer 
Mike 
Hulsebus 

in Oklahoma City to cover the 
historic moment.

“This is obviously a great 

moment for Michigan and for 
Michigan softball and all the 
alums in the Big Ten Conference,” 
Hutchins told the Daily. “I’m 
mostly so proud of these kids 
because they are incredible and 
have been all week.”

Hutchins’ mantra of Michigan 

softball 
radiates 
throughout 

the program today, a sign of the 
continuity she has been able to 
establish over the years.

She has done it because she 

had the chance, starting with her 
courage in action 37 years ago.

125TH ANNIVERSARY

Barnes 
Arico 
earns 

extension

By BRAD WHIPPLE

Daily Sports Writer

It wasn’t chance that led 

last year’s Michigan women’s 
basketball team to the WNIT 
Semifinals for the second time 
in program history. Rather, it 
was the intense work ethic that 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico 
had 
instilled 
in 
the 

Wolverines.

And when the day comes for 

Michigan to hang its first banner 
in Crisler Center, there is now an 
increased likelihood that it will 
be Barnes Arico who leads the 
Wolverines there.

Monday 
morning, 
Interim 

Athletic Director Jim Hackett 
announced that Barnes Arico 
agreed to a three-year contract 
extension, which will keep her 
at Michigan through the 2020-21 
season.

The contract sets Barnes 

Arico’s base pay at $360,000 
in addition to supplemental 
monetary bonuses based on team 
performance, such as winning 
the Big Ten Tournament. 

“When I came to Michigan 

three 
years 
ago, 
I 
really 

believed it was a place my 
family and I would be at for a 
long time,” Barnes Arico said 
in a statement. “I left a top-20 
program and the region I grew 
up in because I believed in the 
vision of Michigan, everything 
it has to offer its student-
athletes and its commitment to 
excellence.”

Added Hackett: “I know what 

an outstanding coach we have 
in Kim, and I’m thrilled to get 
this extension in place. Kim has 
done a fantastic job of developing 
students both academically and 
athletically.”

In 2012, Barnes Arico left the 

Big East, ending her 10-year stint 
at St. John’s.

“H-back ... 

fullback, tight 
end, I kind of 
play all three.”
