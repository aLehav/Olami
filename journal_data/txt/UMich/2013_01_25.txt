Online ed. counsel hired

Kaul to advise
University on
digital ventures
By MATTHEW JACKONEN
Daily StaffReporter
Hopingtoexpand thebreadth
of technology use inside and
outside the classroom, the Uni-
versity has appointed Gautam
Kaul as special counsel for digi-

tal education initiatives within
the Office of the Provost.
According to a University
press release the appoint-
ment was made to ensure the
University is "thinking strate-
gically about educational tech-
nologies."
Kaul currently serves as John
C. and Sally S. Morley Profes-
sor of Finance at the Business
School and has been at the Uni-
versity for nearly three decades.
Last year, Kaul taught an

introductory finance class on
Coursera, a massive open online
course website that attracted
roughly 133,000 registered stu-
dents. Coursera is the Universi-
ty's primary MOOC vehicle, but
is just one of the avenues that
Kaul will oversee in his work on
digital education.
Kaul earned his Ph.D. from
the University of Chicago in
1985 and has served on several
technology-related committees
during his time at Michigan. He

is currently managing director
of the Social Venture Fund and
serves on the advisory board of
the Erb Institute for Global Sus-
tainable Enterprise.
There are currently seven
University faculty members
who have composed courses to
be used on Coursera, with more
planned for the future.

ORGANIZED LABOR CHOICE WORDS
GEO weighs impact of
right-to-work law '

Leaders concerned
about impact on
health insurance
By STEPHEN YAROS
Daily Staff Reporter
Although Wednesday night
was only their first meeting of
the year, the Graduate Employ-
ees' Organization was already
focused on what will define their
group for 2013: figuring out how
to function under Michigan's
new right-to-work legislation.
Right-to work legislation,
which has been passed in 23
other states, allows employees

in union represented workplaces
to not automatically have dues
deductedfromhisorher pay.The
law's moves through Michigan's
legislature at the end of the 2012
session drew headlines nation-
wide.
Although the new rules offi-
cially goes into effect in March
of this year, GEO's current con-
tract runs through March 1,
2014. While this does not affect
GEO employees as of now, future
membership is at stake, union
officials say.
Rackham student Emily How-
ard, communications co-chair
for GEO, wrote in an e-mail
interview that the fear among
union advocates is that, with

less members and money, unions
around the state risk diminished
bargaining power.
"GEO's bargaining power is
people power," Howard wrote.
"As long as members stay orga-
nized keep active, bargaining
should proceed as usual."
Non-members and the media
were prohibited from attending
Wednesday night's GEO meet-
ing, but Howard wrote that
health insurance was a major
concern expressed.
"The benefit most in danger
under this legislation is ... health
insurance," Howard wrote.

Six students using
CSG funds for
projects around
the globe
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily Staff Reporter
While Central Student Gov-
ernment announced the pro-
gram only a month before the
start of this semester, Take
U-M Abroad has already given
six University students study-,
ing abroad this semester $1,000
each for an individual project.

The program, which was
described as stamping the block
'M' across the globe, had over
40 applicants, according to LSA
freshman Nicole Mott, the CSG
intern who headed the program.
Student participants in the pro-
gram are traveling to countries
such as South Korea, Australia
and Spain.
The program had few stipu-
lations for applicants; Mott said
CSG was originally expecting
only 20 to 25 applications. She
was pleased that the original
estimation was exceeded and
added that most of the projects
were hard to pass on.
"We actually had ahard time

deciding between different
projects becausethey were all
prettygood," Mottsaid.
The program originally only
allotted money for five scholar-
ships, but Mott said a sixth was
added when CSG found one pro-
gram submitted after the dead-
line to be deserving.The money
awarded to students is not being
used to fund the trips, but is to
be used only to fund projects
that students start while abroad.
Mott said she will be check-
ing in with the participating
students during the semester
to ensure their funds are being
used appropriately. She added

Michigan drowns
A Northern Michigan Univer-
sity women's soccer player who
drowned during a team workout
in a campus pool had epilepsy
and may have had a seizure as
recently as last summer, accord-
ing to newly released investiga-
tive reports that detail the frantic
attempt to revive her.
The medical examiner's office
ruled Arianna "Anna" Alioto's
death an accidental drowning,
and didn't mention her epilepsy
or suggest that any health condi-
tion may have contributed to her
drowning.
The newly released reports,
which The Associated Press
obtained through Freedom of
Information act requests, don't
contradict the medical examiner's
findings, but they do show that the
18-year-old freshman midfielder
needed medication to keep epilep-

A rare freezing rain caused
major havoc in Salt Lake City

The Salt Lake City Internation-

of passengers. The closure came
after a Frontier Airlines plane
landing from Denver slid on a
patch of ice while on the runway.
Nobody was injured.
Morning commutes were
brought to a crawl by the icy con-

Youth activists and opposition
groups have called for large ral-
lies on the anniversary Friday
in Cairo's Tahrir Square and in
front of the president palace in
the upscale suburb, Heliopolis.
The protests, which left doz-

Rhod Islandoe approves gay
marriage bill after debate

Vote overcomes
Catholic opposition
to legislation
PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP)
- The Rhode Island House of
Representatives on Thursday
overwhelmingly passed legisla-
tion to allow gays and lesbians
to marry in the only New Eng-
land state where they can't.
The House voted 51-19 after
an often emotional debate that
touched on civil rights, reli-
gion and the nature of mar-
riage. The bill now moves to
the Senate, where both sup-
porters and opponents of gay
marriage say it is difficult to
predict the bill's fate.
"This has been a long jour-
ney," said House Speaker
Gordon Fox, who is gay and
supported same-sex legisla-
tion when it was first intro-
duced in 1997. "Today is a great
day. Today ... we stand for
equality, we stand for justice."

Thursday's vote posed the
most significant challenge
yet for gay marriage in Rhode
Island. While the five other
New England states already
allow gay couples to marry,
attempts have fallen flat in this
heavily Catholic state.
"I wanted to be here to see it,"
said 70-year-old Warwick resi-
dent Ken Fish, who is gay. Fish
showed up at the Statehouse
hours early to ensure he had a
seat in the crowded viewing gal-
lery. "Go back 10 years, even five
years, and I wasn't sure we'd
ever get here. We're not done
yet, but this is a big one."
Nine states and the District
of Columbia now allow gay and
lesbian couples to marry.
Gay marriage opponents vow
to press their case in the Sen-
ate, where Senate President
Teresa Paiva Weed, D-Newport,
remains opposed to the legisla-
tion. Chris Plante, director of
the state chapter of the National
Institute for Marriage, said he
believes state leaders who sup-

port gay marriage aren't reflect-
ing public sentiment.
"Rhode Islanders care about
marriage, and they don't want
to see it redefined," he said.
Some opponents have sug-
gested placing gay marriage on
the ballot as a referendum, but
the idea is a nonstarter with Fox
and independent Gov. Lincoln
Chafee, agaymarriage supporter.
A handful of lawmakers rose
during the debate to criticize
gay marriage as a dangerous
social experiment. Rep. Arthur
Corvese, D-North Providence,
warned lawmakers that same-
sex marriage was an "irrevo-
cable societal game-changer"
that would redefine "the fun-
damental building block of our
community" and could lead to
the legalization of polygamy or
plural marriages.
"Truth must not be sacrificed
on the altar of political correct-
ness," he said. "Is this the vision
you want for Rhode Island's
future? Is this the future you
want for America?"

Inspired by Obama, global leaders
to focus on climate change issues

World Economic
Forum attendees
discuss new
political tactics
DAVOS, Switzerland (AP)-
Hurricanes, floods, droughts
and a newly climate-conscious
Barack Obama are helping
boost efforts around the world
to fight climate change.
Top political and finan-
cial leaders at the World Eco-
nomic Forum in Davos say
recent natural disasters, along
with Obama's inauguration
announcement this week that
he's making the battle against
rising temperatures a pillar of
his second term, could rev up
the glacially slow climate pact
negotiations and revive fund-
raising for global action to cool
the planet.
"Unless we take action on
climate change, future genera-
tions will be roasted, toasted,
fried and grilled," Internation-
al Monetary Fund Managing
Director Christine Lagarde told
participants at Davos.
The U.N.'s climate chief,
Christiana Figueras, told The
Associated Press in an inter-
view- Thursday that Obama's.
emphasis on climate "definitely
is a political boost." She said
Hurricane Sandy and drought
in the Midwest last year helped
push climate change back onto
the U.S. political debate.
"We also need to see clearly,
much more engagement from
the United States, we need to
a confirmation from the new
leadership in China that they
remain on course and are will-
ing to engage further. From the
Europeans, we need to see that
they also remain on course,"
Figueras said. "And then all of
the emerging economies, in
addition to China, need to begin
to explore the opportunities
that they have."
The U.N. climate talks, now
two decades in the making,
have so far failed to reduce car-
bon dioxide and other green-

house gas emissions that most
scientists say are warming the
Earth.
Participants at the Davos
forum - which identifies
extreme weather as one of the
top three risks to the global.
economy - called for global
action.
Until now, rich and poor
countries have accused U.S.
leaders of hampering the global
fight against climate change,
which scientists say is caus-
ing a rise in temperatures and
sea levels, threatening island
nations and other low-lying
areas, and shifting weather
patterns to produce more
droughts, floods and devastat-
ing storms.
Figueras, the daughter of a
former Costa Rican president,
and Costa Rican President
Laura Chinchilla both said
their country could serve as an
example.
"Costa Rica is already pro-
ducing 90 percent of the energy
we are consuming from renew-
able sources," Chinchilla told
AP. "We are encouraging the
policies of many different com-
panies - many are already
adopting the right policies. For
example, in the agricultural
sector, we already have coffee
which is certified carbon-neu-
tral coffee."
European Union Climate
Commissioner Connie Hede-
gaard called the battle against
global warming the greatest
economic challenge of this cen-
tury.
Several CEOs of major banks
and businesses said there
have been robust discussions
at Davos on potential private
financing for "green" technolo-
gies to produce cleaner sources
of energy.
So far, nations have ponied
up about $30 billion toward the
$100 billion a year goal by 2020
set at Copenhagen's U.N. cli-
mate talks in 2009.
A U.N. climate conference in
Doha, Qatar, agreed in Decem-
ber to extend the Kyoto Pro-
tocol, a treaty that limits the
greenhouse gas output of some

rich countries, and agreed to
adopt a new global climate pact
by 2015. But hopes for stronger
U.S. leadership in the ongo-
ing U.N. climate talks were
dimmed when legislation to cap
emissions stalled in Congress.
"We're coming out of two
years of climate silence," said
Fred Krupp, president of the
U.S.-based Environmental
Defense Fund. "The impacts
of extreme weather are now
affecting everybody in the wal-
let."
Krupp said while no one is
going to invest in unprofitable
new technologies, a growing
number of clean-energy invest-
ments are highly profitable.
Nations also agreed at the
U.N. climate talks in Copen-
hagen to set a goal of limiting
global warming to 2 degrees
Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahren-
heit). But because of inaction,
Figueras said, the world is now"
on "somewhere between a 4
and 6 degree (Celsius) trajec-
tory."
"But the door is not closed,"
she .quickly added. "We have
the technology, we have the
capital. We have the possibil-
ity."
U.N. Secretary-General Ban
Ki-moon says one of his top
hopes for 2013 is to reach a new
agreement on climate change.
"Slowly but steadily, we are
coming to realize the risks
of a carbon-based economy,"
he told the forum Thursday.
"Those supposedly longer-
term issues are actually silent
crises with us today: the death
of children from preventable
diseases; the melting of the
polar ice caps because of cli-
mate change. ... Let not our
inaction today lead to harsh
judgment tomorrow."
Prince Albert II of Monaco,
whose foundation focuses on
climate change and other envi-
ronmental issues, said Obama's
inauguration speech gave a
welcome lift toward collective
action.
"That can only be positive,
because we need to have the
U.S. on board," he told the AP.

Military offensive
in former colony
continues advance
SAN, Mali (AP) - Mali's rebel
movement showed new signs of
discord on Thursday in the wake
of punishing French air strikes,
with one wing of the Ansar Dine
group now pledging to negotiate
an end to the country's crisis and
possibly even fight against its for-
mer comrades-in-arms.
France's air and land cam-
paign that began two weeks ago
to save Mali's .embattled interim
government has shaken up the
military landscape and put the
international spotlight on the
former French colony. Mali's gov-
ernment was on a new political
defensive, urging its soldiers to
respect human rights after new
allegations that they had car-
ried out summary executions in
zones of battle against the radical
Islamists.
Three al-Qaida-linked extrem-
ist groups have controlled Mali's
vast northeast for months, capi-
talizing on chaos that followed
a coup d'etat in Mali's capital,
Bamako, in March. But in a new
sign of splintering, former Ansar
Dine leader Alghabass Ag Intal-
la told the Associated Press on
Thursday that he and his men
were breaking off from Ansar
Dine "so that we can be in control
of our own fate."
"We are neither AQIM or
MUJAO," he said of the other
groups, al-Qaida in the Islamic
Maghreb and the Movement for
the Unity and Jihad in West Afri-
ca, known by its French-language
acronym. "We are a group of peo-
ple from the north of Mali who
have a set of grievances that date
back at least 50 years."
The comments suggested that

at least some of Islamist fighters
are searching for, an exit in the
wake of the French airstrikes.
French radio RFI reported ear-
lier Thursday that Intalla's new
group will be called the Islamic
Movement for the Azawad, a
Tuareg term for northern Mali,
and his men are willing to fight
their former comrades-in-arms
in Ansar Dine.
"We are not terrorists. We are
ready to negotiate," Intalla told
the AP.
A French diplomatic official
said Francewas taking seriously
the claims of a split within Ansar
Dine - but needed proof, not just
words.
AQIM and MUJAO have been
classified as terror groups by the
U.N., and Ansar Dine has been
"clearly associated" with them -
even if some of its members have
raised doubts about how close
those ties are, the official said.
"The other groups that have
formed need to show which side
they're on ... and prove it on the
ground," said the official, who
was not authorized to discuss the
matter publicly. "Are they with
the terrorists, or not?"
"They could, for example, free
up territory themselves and no
longer say that the Malian army
is not welcome in the north - and
instead work with it," the official
said.
Late last year, Ansar Dine held
talks in neighboring Burkina Faso
with Malian government repre-
sentatives, and one of the sticking
points was a disagreement over
whether Malian law or Islamic
Shariah law would be applied.
Rebels have at times applied
their interpretation of Shariah
to carry out public executions,
amputations, and whippings
- for infractions ranging from
possessing cigarettes to women
going out without headscarves.

Advanced (dis)placement
Denial of AP credit at Dartmouth will cost students
Beginning with the entering class of 2014, Advanced Placement
scores will no longer count for college credit at Dartmouth
College. While students can still place out of certain courses
with high AP scores, the scores will not count as progress toward their
degrees. Because strong AP scores in certain subjects might qualify a
student to place out of specific courses, they should be awarded college
credit as well. Not doing so disregards a key purpose of taking AP tests:
earning college credit to lessen the ever-increasing cost of undergradu-
ate education. This sets a troubling precedent for other colleges.

- Notre Dame libbacker Manti Te'o said during
Thursday
Gone (cat)fish

Developed in the 1950s by the College
Board, the AP Program offers more than 30
college-level courses that students cAn take
in high school. Students who receive high
scores on end-of-semester exams can receive
college credit for those courses and possibly
be exempt from some introductory college
classes. For many high-school students, the
purpose of taking an AP course is to gain col-
lege credit and enhance their college applica-
tions. The program even endorses this view,
advertising on its website that taking AP tests
is a way to "earn college credit and place-
ment." Refusing to accept strong AP scores
for college credit runs contraryto their origi-
nal purpose. This practice takes advantage of
students who take AP courses to gain entry
to competitive colleges but are then denied
credits for those courses.
Denying AP credits has resounding finan-
cial implications. At the University of Michi-
gan, for example, a student with AP Calculus
BC scores of 4/5 or 5/5 can be exempted from
introductory math courses and earn four
credits toward his or her degree. If the stu-
dent is part-time, this 4-credit sequence
would cost $2,432 if coming from in-state and
lower division or $6,639 if from out-of-state
and lower division. By doing well on the AP

Calculus BC exam, which costs $89, a stu-
dent can save $2,287 or $6,639, depending
on where they live. Alongside these savings,
granting AP credits also creates opportuni-
tiet for students to pursue other courses,
intellectual interests or employment - which
is increasingly relevant given the rising costs
of tuition.
While some schools like Dartmouth pro-
vide generous financial aid that aims to meet
100 percent of the students' need, the vast
majority of colleges do not have this capa-
bility. While certain schools might deny AP
credits and still cover the financial burden
of taking credits that one would'have other-
wise earned, most colleges cannot. Schools
that refuse to grant AP credits are setting a
dangerous precedent for other institutions
to follow. Should this trend be realized in
schools that are not as wealthy, our institu-
tions of higher education will become even
less accessible.
Colleges that don't grant AP credit must
realize that one key reason students take AP
exams is, in fact, to earn college credit. Dis-
regarding this not only denies the useful-
ness of enriching high-school education with
advanced classes, but also places an unfair
financial burden on students.

By now you've likely familiar-
ized yourself with the Manti
Te'o debacle. The cuckolded,
football star; the
girlfriend who
died, then didn't
die, of cancer;
the lonely Chris-
tian band singer;
the lazy sports
magazine fact
checkers. Clus-
tering around E
like bees protect- XU
ing their queen,
the media outlets
do their best to make appropriate
reparations. Sorry, they buzz. We are
so,so sorry.
"No, never," Teo said when asked
if he played any part in the ruse. Uni-
versity of Notre Dame, doing what
all athletic departments do when
backed into a corner, rallied behind
its star player with ferocious convic-
tion, releasing a statement claiming
that "this appears to be, at a mini-
mum, a sad and very cruel deception
to entertain its perpetrators."
Then, faster than you could say
"Lennay Kekua," Te'o changed his
tune. In an exclusive interview with
Katie Couric on Thursday, he admit-
ted that, whoops, he knew his girl-
friend hadn't passed away when he
received a phone call from a stranger
purporting to be her in early Decem-
ber. And yet, he still grieved for her
"death" on national television two
days later.
"You stuck to the script. And you
knew that something was amiss,
Manti," Couric said, sternly.
"Katie, put yourself in my situ-
ation," Te'o pleaded. "I, my whole
world told me that she died on Sept.
12. Everybody knew that. This girl,
who I committed myself to, died on
Sept.12."
Te'o is better on the field than
under the muted lighting of a net-
work soundstage. Watching him
gracefully sack opponents on the

20-yard line, his face shielded by his
gold helmet, there's something vul-
nerable about him - almost poetic.
You want to root for this guy; this
sweat soft-hearted hunk of a hero.
In interiews, he's fine - calm, enun-
ciates well - but is still somehow dis-
ingenuous and unreadable.
Ever since the sad, strange nar-
rative exploded on Deadspin a little
more than a week ago, ESPN has
been covering the aftermath in
careful, pointillist detail. Was Te'o
complicit in the hoax or a victim of
it? Experts dish up new theories by
the hour, reading his eyebrows, the
timestamps of his cell phone calls, a
receipt from 1-800-FLOWERS and
anything else they can grasp onto
that would indict or salvage the hap-
less football player.
What's struck me most about the
coverage of the Te'o storyline is the
witch-hunt-like, us-versus-them
mentality writers have taken on. Te'o
is either vilified as a publicity-seek-
ing faker or a sweet, spotless fool,
with in-between. The audience,
for it part, has eaten it up with the
breathless excitement of a criminal
wiretap. But, why all the fascination?
Why do we feel personally offended
that agirl we never knew didn't die of.
cancer and that a guy we've only seen
onthe Big Ten Network might have a
fetish for whisperingsweet nothings
to a wall of static?
The kicker is that Nev Schulman,
creator of the film "Catfish" and the
MTV show of the same name, has
been crowned the authority on all
things Internet hoax, oft sought-
after in interviews to arbitrate Te'o's
innocence. Never mind that Schul-
man's own "discovery" that the girl
he was so in love with who ended up
being a lonely, overweight lady from
rural Michigan had its own whiffs
of deceit. It seems suspicious that
this twenty-something Jewish boy in
skinny jeans could have been hood-
winked by a woman two times his
senior, and that the whole endeavor

zing
wasn't really just an excuse to cash
out and become famous - that the
making of "Catfish" wasn't a kind of
catfish in itself.
We all throw half-
truths of our lives
into cyberspace.
In my humble, non-evidentiary
opinion, Te'o probably had some idea
of what was going on - maybe not at
the beginning, but certainly at the
very end.:Why am I so sure?
Because we all do it: we all cat-
fish. Ever since our lives migrated
online, there's been this American
Dream-like possibility of self-con-'
structing how the world should see
us. We throw fabulist, half-true-
half-not tales of our lives into
cybersphere, carefully editing and
tagging our photos to produce the
lives we'd like to have. We're not
so different from Te'o, who cat-
fished a beautiful Stanford student
with a "warm smile and soulful
eyes," or from Sports Illustrated,
who catfished a great, Greek epic
in its fawning October profile of
Te'o, titled "The Full Manti." This
mutual exchange of fact and fiction
is part of an invisible contract we
sign when we power up our laptops
and log onto Facebook. The story
of the fallen Heisman contender
resonates because we have all been
Manti Te'o. We've been both ver-
sions of him: the cuckoldee and the
cuckolder.
But what happens when the con-
tract breaks, as Te'o's has? Then the
shimmering versions of the selves
we'd like to be dissolve like Pepto-
Bismol tablets. No, that can't be what
I really look like. Oh, but it is.

The irony of gentlemen's night'

In the United States, a marijuana user is
arrested every 42 seconds. With that many
people arrested, imagine the even greater num-
ber of people who are associated with someone
who was once incarcerated for using, possess-
ing or growing pot. It could be anyone: perhaps
it was your college friend just having some
weekend fun or your great uncle with stomach
cancer who was once locked up on possession
charges. Maybe it was you who was arrested
and suffered the consequences of the outdated
U.S. marijuana laws. What are the police really
solving by busting these users? Are they actu-
ally creating a safer and freer country as they
have been telling us for years?
Approximately half of all drug busts in the
United States are pot-related with 87 percent
of these arrests being for the non-violent pos-
session of marijuana. Because most of the drug
arrests are non-violent offenders, their time
spentincorrectionalfacilitiesisoftenmoreinju-
rious than beneficial. Instead of being "rehabili-
tated," many of the nonviolent citizens actually
become more aggressive and spiral deeper into
the criminal system. In order to survive, they
must mimic the ways of actual violent offend-
ers surrounding them. To solve'this issue, the
federal government must reclassify or totally
eliminate marijuana - and potentially other
drugs - from the Drug Enforcement Agen-
cy's controlled substance list. Drug offenders
need authentic rehabilitation, not seclusion or
repeatedexposure to violence.
Under the Controlled Substances Act of
1970, marijuana is classified as a Schedule I
drug with no use for medicinal purposes and
high potential for abuse. It occupies this cat-
egory alongside more dangerous drugs such
as heroin, LSD and crack cocaine. It's ridicu-
lous that pot is classified as a higher risk than
extremely addictive drugs like cocaine and
oxycodone.
By classifying weed as a Schedule I drug,
people who have exposure to the drug may
believe the government is implying that other
drugs have similar side effects. This, however,
is deceptive and dangerous. Compared to pot,
the other drugs in the Schedule I class are

extremely dangerous. More than one-third
of U.S. citizens have tried marijuana with no
reports of addiction or death. Furthermore, as
of the November election, 18 states and Wash-
ington D.C. now have marijuana-friendly
legislation. The majority of the American pop-
ulation recognizes the harmlessness of THC.
Why can't the federal government?
"Marijuana should be legalized for many
reasons, but the most important reason is
because it is a civil rights infraction," Miles
Gerou, president of Eastern Michigan Univer-
sity's chapter of Students for a Sensible prug
Policy, said. "There is too much fact to show
that marijuana is relatively harmless, and cer-
tainly not lethal, to keep putting good citizens
in jail for making healthier choices than the
legal recreation drugs offered in our country."
Though many Americans have come to
the same conclusion, the federal government
refuses to budge. THC is still described as
more dangerous than Xanax, morphine, oxy-
codone and many other legal substances in
the United States. So instead of rolling up a
doobie I should pop apill, right?
Wrong. It's outrageous to believe that weed
is more harmful than the subsequent drugs in
lower class schedules. The idea that marijua-
na is a "gateway" drug is also absurd. In most
instances, people.experiment with nicotine or
alcohol before trying marijuana. Therefore,
the two most commonly used legal substanc-
es in the United States are the first gateway
drugs into the illicit substance community.
For decades, marijuana has been wrong-
fully labeled amongst our society. The time
for change is now. Much of our country has
legalized pot in some way, which alludes to
the majority of American's acceptance for pot.
Our right to use marijuana in a similar way
we use tobacco and nicotine needs to be rec-
ognized. The first few steps have been taken:
marijuana prohibition is slowly ending state
by state. Now it's time to tackle the federal
government and their illogical classifications.
It's legalization time.
Aarica Marsh is an LSA sophomore.

Last week, we had a "gentle-
men's night" at my co-op.
Just wait for the irony of
that statement.
Gentlemen's -
night is essen-
tially a Thurs-
day ' night our
co-op designates!
for fancy vests,
unfortunate
fedoras and good
beer. Female KATHERINE
house members STEEN
are invited, too,
although we're
technically the gentlemen's "dates."
Basically, it brings in the weekend
with a modest gathering of well-
dressed gals and gents.Atleast, that's
the way it's supposed tobe.
This particular gentlemen's night
ended up being a bit larger in size
than I'm used to. I leaned against
a doorway, surveying my gentle-
menly kingdom, and I felt a hand on
my waist - a grab. I hardly noticed
it until I saw the hand that touched
me wasn't attached to my boyfriend.
He walked by without turning back.
It was as if it didn't even happen, and
for a little bit, I believed that it didn't.
Then I saw him, again, come up
behind a female housemate and
clamp her body like bear trap, almost
picking her up off the ground. She
didn't even respond. Not a smile, not
a playful shove, nothing. Hmm.
"Maybethey'refriends",Ithought.
"I shouldn't assume things."
So I sat at a dining room table,
watching him. But, as I sat there, a
friend sitting next to me was busy
asking me who even invited that guy.
And while she began to list off all
the women he had rubbed, groped
or left a grease mark on that night,
I watched him walk up to a house-
mate sitting across me. I watched
her pause, petrified, as she tried to
process whose thick arms were now

draped around her neck and chest.
I asked her if she wanted him to
be doing that, with the response of
a nervous smile and "No." It seemed
simple enough.
I told him that he had grabbed half
the women in this house. I received
a response implying that I wished he
would touch me. I told him to get the
fuckoj.
I f ticed a few things in the
moment after he wandered off. I
could feel the red rage glow on my
face, my heart pound and the fight-
or-flight response through every
vein. I felt tense but poised, stand-
ing a little taller than I usually do -
maybe because I was wearing heels
that night for the first time since
high-school prom. And I slowly
began to gain consciousness of the
voices surrounding me offering
their gratitude.
That night, I had five women from
my co-op thank me, citing their own
personal grievances with that oily,
oversized creep. Let me clarify: Five
women from my own house thanked
me for kicking a guy they all didn't
feel comfortable with out of their
own house. Why did it take grope
number one, two, three - whatever
- for us to finally do something about
it? In our own damn house?
Maybe for the same reason that
I almost completely forgot he had
grabbed me: It's easier to just do
nothing. It's actually kind of awk-
ward, even, to do something - or
worse, terrifying. Was this a matter
.of giving someone the benefit of the
doubt four too many times? Or were
we scared in our own house even
when surrounded by our friends
and housemates?
I'm not being completely honest
when I say I kicked him out. I told
him to get the fuck out, sure, but the
person to actually kick him out was
a male housemate. He didn't leave
when I told him to; he actually just

moved to another room. What am I
going to do about it, right? a ,
So, success - he left. But I still
feel unsatisfied with the collective
response of that night.
We shouldn't need

a guy to kick a
creep out of
the house.

First, I don't think he realized
he did anything wrong. Perhaps he
woke up the next day in a groggy,
skull-splitting, hungover fog and
then remembered some dude kicked
him out of a co-op the night before.
After which, he probably shrugged
and ate a hearty breakfast of bacon
and nice guy syndrome. I really don't
think I got through to him, which is
why I want to doit all over again..
I was more than capable of
explaining the house rules to him in
a civil, composed, cold fox manner.
In fact, I wanted to prove that I was
neither the damsel in distress nor a
frantic feminist chucking ashtrays
at his neck as he fled off our porch.
Moral of the story: I just wanted to
do it myself.
We shouldn't need a gentleman
to kick a creep out of the house. And
you know what? We didn't really
need him to. Yes, that night was
termed a "gentlemen's night", butin
reality, it should have belonged to
the ladies - fuck it, to the women.
We don't have to be polite or even
nice. Actually, we should be angry.
Maybe not ashtray-chucking angry,
but we should be angry enough to
say something.

In a March interview, Miller

"In the same way that the Uni-

While Miller served inthe posi-

begin at midnight and end Sun-
day morning.
"(On Sunday morning) we're,
going to have an expo similar to,
like, a science fair where we're
inviting the public in," Fontenot
said. "You're going to pretty
much be demoing your hacks to
anyone who's interested."
MHacks has already spent
about $50,000 on the event so
far. The majority of that money,
$23,600, will pay for transpor-
tation costs, including buses to
shuttle students from students
from other schools in the region.
The next highest expenditure is
$16,500 on food - with $3,000
allodated for Red Bull alone.

The hackathon will be financed
by donations from several spon-
sors, including Mail Chimp, ven-
ture capital firm Andreessen
Horowitz, Groupon and others.
Despite its sizeable budget,
MHacks has allocated no money
for lodging. But Fontenot said
that's deliberate.
"At a hackathon, you usually
take, like, a 3-hour nap or some-
thing in the middle, but you don't
get a full night's sleep," he said.
Nonetheless, there will be "desig-
nated nap rooms" with neck pil-
lows, Fontenot added.
At the end of the competition,
Fontenot said the best app isn't
necessarily the most profitable
app, but the most usable. Teams
cheating by teams is a possibil-
ity, but preparing an app before
the competition could do little to
help ateam's cause.
"(Cheating) has happened
before and it's somewhat hard
to detect," he said. "I honestly
think that the most innovation

comes in this kind of setting
where you're completely under
pressure."
He continued by saying the
limited time forces apps to be
fairly basic, but these form the
foundation for later development.
"A lot of the most successful
apps ... started off really, really
simple," he said.
Last weekend, programmers
from the University traveled to
the University of Pennsylvania
for PennApps, which Fontenot
said is the nation's premier col-
lege hackathon. Fontenot said
MHacks intends to overtake Pen-
nApps in terms of prestige and
student involvement.
440 students participated in
PennApps and MHacks already,
has about 450 students signed
up, Fontenot said still shy of the
500-student goal.
Students interested in sign-
ing up for MHacks can sign up at
the Hackathon's event page. The
event is free.

MOOCs are very important as a
new forum for education, they are
also limited in many ways.
"MOOCs are an incredibly
handy vehicle for packaging up
material that can be taught effec-
tively in this style," Russell said.
"Having said that, not all educa-
tional material fits into this for-
mat equally well."
Performance studies such
as music or theater complicate
the matter, but Russell said
he believes new technologies
will arise to satiate the need to
advance these disciplines.
"You will start to see the inte-

GradCare, they could not afford
to attend grad school at UM."
However, Howard argued that
this will not be a problem for
GEO. She noted that as long as
most members stay active, right-
to-work legislation will have little
to no effect.
"GEO has an advantage because

gration of different sorts of real-
time interaction technologies
in a sort of collaborative sense
and in an individual one-on-one
sense that will allow us to evolve
in ways that will allow this stuff
to happen," Russell said.
However, MOOCs also stand
as a potential threat to the Uni-
versity's revenue. Russell added
that while the fear is that MOOCs
will deteriorate the need for uni-
versities, the institutions retain
an "experience that is difficult to
reproduce" in an online platform.
Russell also noted that the use
of MOOCs is still in the experi-
mental phase, and many factors
are unknown, such as how they
will be funded and whether free
MOOCs will prove to be viable
since we have a completely demo-
cratic structure and such a high
turnover rate in our membership,
bottom-up, member-to-member
organizing is already what we're
used to," Howard wrote.
Howard worries the discon-
nected unions will suffer the
most, and GEO's member-focged
strategies are more effective than
the traditional top-down model.
GEO's membership consists of
graduate student instructors and
graduate student assistants, total-

against premium, paid versions.
At the September meet-
ing of the University's Board
of Regents, several members
expressed concerns about pro-
viding the online courses for free
in light of a perennially difficult
budget situation. University Vice
Provost for Academic and Bud-
getary Affairs Martha Pollack
told the regents that while the
University is currently offering
online courses for free of charge,
it could begin charging for pro-
fessional and continuing-educa-
tion courses.

Although the legislation is
unpopular within union ranks,
Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder and
the Republican-majority Michi-

that maintaining "cultural sensi-
tivity" was also a top priority for
the students participating in the
Take U-M Abroad program.
"You don't really want to
impose your views on any-
one else," she said. "I think it's
important to look for projects
that are not only a good idea, but

also are adaptable."
One student is going to make
a "cross-cultural cookbook" that
'draws from the foods of Michi-
gan and Cape Verde, an island
nation in the Atlantic Ocean near
Africa, where the student will be
studying. Sales of the cookbook
will go toward funding charities
in Cape Verde.
Following the participating
students' trips abroad, Mott said
CSG will be creating a book-
let and a presentation with the

results. She added that CSG is
looking to continue the program
through summer term and may
look for more ways to institution-
alize it.
In an e-mail interview, Busi-

out of major cities and towns.
Since then, the group has
carried out deadly attacks tar-

bombings that targeted military
and security compounds.

Irritating cast
holds back 'Nerds'

New TBS reality
program zooms in
on nerd culture
By EMILY BODDEN .
For the Daily
Our society ' seems to be
saturated with an obsession of
so-called "nerd culture." After
experienc-
ing great suc-
cess with its
popular sitcom, King of the
"The Big Bang Nerds
Theory," TBS
green-lighted Pilot
the creation
of its newest Thursdays at
series, "King of 10:00 p.m.
the Nerds." TBS
The show
is the station's
first unscripted competition pro-
gram in seven years. Beginning
with 11 cast members, the contes-
tants compete in weekly challeng-
es that eliminate a contestant each
episode. The ultimate goal is to be
crowned "King of the Nerds," sit
on "the Throne of Games" and
win the $100,000 grand prize. A
clever pun on "Game of Thrones,"
the physical throne represents the
fantasy show's Iron Throne com-
posed of Nerf weapons and game
pieces. In the first few episodes,
the contestants will compete on
teams before splitting into an
"every man for himself" setup.
"King of the Nerds" is the work
of the same people who produced
"The Amazing Race," "Survivor"
and "Mythbusters," so if this show
is to become as successful as these
three, it certainly has the team to
accomplish it. The producers pos-
sess an ideal mix of backgrounds
with competition and science
shows, and their previous work
has proven to be both interesting
and entertaining.
The show tries to celebrate
their intellect and geekiness, but
it seems to fall short. While some
contestants are feasibly real peo-

Powerhouse cast can't

"It's wizard's chess!"
ple, others seem to act like exag-
gerated stereotypes.
Danielle, for instance, not only
sports a head full of neon-pink
hair, but calls herself the "Queen
of WoW" ("World of Warcraft,"
a popular massively multiplayer
online role-playing game). She
also claims to have played over
6,500 games of "Halo" ... which
begs the question: Howis she get-
ting in her "WoW" time if all she
is doing is playing "Halo"?
Then there is Jon, with his styl-"
ish ombre-red hair, who claims
(somewhat unconvincingly) to
love math and theoretical phys-
ics. Hendrik, meanwhile, tries
to speak raven (yes, he wishes to
learn to speak with birds) in one
of the interviews.
The first episode has the 11
contestants split into two teams
to compete in a "Nerd War." This
results in a hilarious scene of the
nerds competitively nerd-offing.
The contestants are constantly
trying to one-up each other with
their talents. Danielle is in awe of
Celeste, who is a pro gamer who
can also solve Rubik's Cubes in
record time. Brandon, a neuro-
scientist, tries towinthe affection
of the team captains by dancing
enthusiastically (well, spastically)
to the popular video game "Just
Dance."
Picking their teams, the nerds

had to pour paint on their choic-
es. Between each pick, the cam-
era cuts to the contestants and
reveals them bragging about their
respective skills. In no way are
the interviews endearing; the
contestants actually seem less
likeable than high-school seniors
bragging about their ACT and AP
scores. When neither team choos-
es Alana, she pathetically whines
about being a nerd until she finds
that she has been granted all of the
power. The editing does not paint
flattering portraits of the contes-
tants, and it certainly doesn't cre-
ate any emotional attachments
with the viewers.
To create a successful real-
ity show, you need to either build
strong connections with the con-
testants or showcase challenges
so exciting or ridiculous that it
draws viewers back each week.
The characters in "King of the
Nerds" are not strange enough
to be entertaining and cross the
line into being irritating.
With more episodes, we will
see if TBS's plunge into this par-
ticular brand of reality-based
competition series was a wise
decision by the studio's execu-
tives. If they wish to last more
than one season, the producers
need to rethink their approach
on both how they present their
contestants and their challenges.

- a staple of this genre - are wide

It's a slow, predictable ride that

impress as awhole.
Wahlberg dons his usual attire
as the brutish, curt, irreverent
leading man who hits people
really hard, but unlike the arche-
typal "troubled" protagonist
who undergoes the maturation
process to become a "good guy,"
Wahlberg's character is as flat as
a pancake. It's almost impossible
to conjure an iota of sympathy for
Billy because he brings all of his
troubles upon himself: He loses
his girlfriend (an aspiring actress)
after punching out her co-star at a
movie premiere, he goes to prison .
for shooting a delinquent in cold
blood and, when he relapses after
seven years of sobriety, he only
has himself to blame.
Zeta-Jones's on-screen pres-
ence is severely muted and
rather nonexistent despite the
integral nature of her role. She's
a powerhouse performer, who
is idiotically and entirely unde-
rutilized - as is Chandler, who
brings a vivid, albeit brief, por-
trayal of a passionate political
motivator.
The saving grace is Crowe,
who effortlessly embodies an
arrogant, ruthless, win-at-all-
costs scoundrel on a power trip,
and it's a pleasure to loathe him
as he weaves a web of economic
corruption. His scenes are rays
of sunshine among a dim and
drab storyline that would oth-
erwise be nearly fully devoid of
any brightness.
A more experienced writer
(just one previous screenplay
under his belt would've been
encouraging), a less brood-
ing, bumbling Wahlberg and a
way more electric Zeta-Jones
and charming Chandler might
have been enough to repair
this flawed film. But, while the
trusty politicians of New York
- and the rest of the country -
will always have the chance to
make improvements to society,
it's too late now to fix "Broken
City."

CINEMATIC
Shouldn't you be in school, young man?
Breaking down the
best mixtapes of 21

By JACKSON HOWARD
DailyArts Writer
2012 was a chaotic year for.
rap music. Just as important as
ever were mixtapes, the free
semi-albums that rappers put
out online. Ultimately, the mix-
tape catalogue of 2012 provides
an eclectic mix of thought-
provoking, speaker-breaking,
strip-club-shaking free music.
Without further ado, I give you
the top eight mixtapes of 2012.
8. Gucci Mane - Trap Back
(DJ Holiday)
Gucci Mane has made so many
mixtapes that, at this point, it
seems impossible he'd have any-
thing left to say. Wrong. Comple-
mented by production and guest
spots from Southside, Lex Luger,
Waka Flocka, 2 Chainz and
more, Gucci uses his usual half-
decipherable drawl to weave
together a more-than-enjoyable
tape full of nonsensical similes,
eerie synths and obscure drug
references that should satisfy
diehard fans. Brrrr.
7. Juicy J - Blue Dream &
Lean(DJ Scream)
Let me say this: If you have
the chance, and are in decent
health, go see Juicy J live. It'll
change your life. And maybe kill
you. Since splitting from Three
6 Mafia, Juicy has re-invented
himself as a solo artist - at
the age of 38. BD&tL is a never-
ending barrage of trap beats,
pre-school-level rhyme schemes
and X-rated content and, though
horrifically long at 28 tracks,
Juicy's energy carries the tape
along. Turn up.
6. Wale - Folarin (DJ Clark
Kent)
Wale rose to fame through
his incredible Seinfeld-inspired
debut mixtape, so it only makes
sense that in preparation for

his upcoming third album he'd
release a tape to hold his fans
over. Folarin finds Wale trading
bars with Rick Ross, 2 Chainz,
Trinidad James and others,
while also displaying his usual
blend of witty and pensive lyr-
ics. Though the tape is fun, let's
hope the new album is a little
more experimental.
5. Fabolous - The Soul Tap
Vol.2(No DJ)
The first The Soul Tape was a
refreshing attempt by a rapper

For his first mixtape in two
years, Big Sean sounded hungry
again. Boasting features from J.
Cole, Kendrick Lamar and Chris
Brown, among others, Sean put
together a project that simulta-
neously was fun to listen to and
demonstrative of his tremendous
growth overthe lasttwoyears. No
longer Kanye's side-act, Sean has
staying power, andDetroitis more
than enough proof.
2. Rick Ross - RichForever(DJ

neled Golden Era hip hop for a
new generation. Flowing over
beats from MF DOOM ("World
Donination"), Lord Finesse.,
("Funky Ho'$") and J Dilla
("Snakes"), Joey and his Pro
Era crew managed to bring back
the heyday of rap with a mix of
lyrical dexterity, wit, introspec-
tiveness and swagger. It may
be the 21st century, but for 15
songs, Joey Bada$$ is happy to
take you back to '92, even if he
wasn't born yet.

A trip home to face
nation's top teams

By JEREMY SUMMITT
Daily Sports Writer
For the No. 11 Michigan water
polo team (1-3), the stakes are
raised this weekend as it heads to
California for three games against
top-10 competition. The Wolver-
ines will play No. 1 Stanford on
Friday before taking on No. 9 San
Jose State and No. 4 California on
Saturday.
But the pressure to beat the
nation's most talented teams
might be superseded by some-
thing else this weekend. There
are 15 Michigan players from
California on this season's roster,
and Michigan coach Matt Ander-
son attended San Jose State as an
undergraduate. Eight of the Cali-
fornia natives come from the Bay
Area ofNorthern California - the
same region where this weekend's
top-ranked competitors are locat-
ed. This weekend is about friends,
family andtmemories for a good
chunk of the squad, and many
players hope to use that as more
motivation against their home
state's highly touted programs.
"Having friends and family
there (watching), you want to do
well," said junior attacker Kelsey
Nolan. "You don't get to do much
of that here."
The Golden State is home to
seven of the nation's top 10 teams.
Year in and year out, California
remains a recruiting goldmine for
coaches across the nation.
"Every high 'school has water
polo in California, so they will
have a lot more athletes to draw
from," Anderson said. "The hot-
bed of water polo is an in-state
school for most of those girls."
Anderson's ties to Northern
California surely have him excit-
ed for this upcoming weekend,
but those connections are also the

reason why Michigan can consis-
tently hang with the top talent on
the West Coast.
"You establish a lot of your
recruiting with any sport in col-
lege with your contacts," Ander-
son said. "I spent so many years
at the high-school level - I have
a lot of contacts, and thus we've
always been NorthernCalifornia
top-heavy in our recruiting."
All of the Wolverines will be
challenged this weekend, to say
the least. Stanford boasts a roster
with three Olympians from this
past summer's gold-medal team
in London - Annika Drips, Melis-
sa Seidemann and Maggie Stef-
fens - as well as the 2012 NCAA
player of the year, Kiley Neushul.
"We need to execute," Ander-
son said. "We understand who
we're playing. On paper, (Stanford
is) the best water polo team ever
put together. But we need to make
the effort to do the things we
want to do, and then we should be
able to head home with a victory
over a higher-ranked team."
A good portion of the Bay Area
natives will play against for-
mer high-school teammates and
coaches this weekend, adding a
bit of extra fuel and passion to the
Michigan sideline. A 1-3 record
following last weekend's Michi-
gan Kick-Off Tournament in Ann
Arbor may have lefta sour taste in
their mouths.
For Nolan and her fellow Cali-
fornians, this weekend is certain-
ly time to cherish past memories
and reminisce with familiar faces.
But Anderson says this weekend's
goal is purely to come home with
awinningrecord.
A few wins would be some-
thing this team is used to, some-
thing comfortable and exciting
- reminiscent of a place just like
home. .

with the Spartans again. LaPlante's message.

"We all just want to beat them
so much," he said.
Saturday, the Wolverines have
a chance to make their mark on
the rivalry. The Wolverines have
dominated the Spartans histori-
cally, with a record of 27-2-1 in
past meetings - including a19-2-
1 record in true dual meets.
This will only be Michigan's
second meet of the season and
the first one that will be scored.
The team is looking forward
to the level of competition that
comes with a dual meet.
"You have to hold serve in
every event," LaPlante said. "You
don't want to get slammed in any
event so you're trying to avoid
them going one-two in anything.
Every guy on the team matters."
One phase of the meet that
Michigan will expect a big per-
formance in is shot put, an event

where the Wolverines finished
with the top three places in their
non-scored opening meet. Red-
shirt sophomore Cody Riffle was
the leader of this group, throwing
17.82 meters. Riffle is currently
ranked third in the Big Ten.
Michigan has five other ath-
letes ranked in the Big Ten's top
eight, and the team will be count-
ing on them Saturday. This group
includes junior Justin, Clarke in
the 60-meter dash, Taylor in the
200-meter dash, junior Herman
Washington in the 60-meter
hurdles, redshirt junior Bradley
James in high jump and redshirt
junior Ethan Dennis in weight
throw.
Though the hype will be
aplenty - even for spectators and
coaches - the Wolverines don't
plan on doing anything different
leading up to the meet.

Michigan easily
downs Indiana to
avenge its first loss
in 11 games
By ALEXA DETTELBACH
Daily Sports Writer
After dropping its first con-
ference game of the season
against Penn State on Monday,
the Michigan women's basket-
ball team hit the road to face
Indiana (1-5 Big Ten, 10-9 over-
all), and it didn't miss a beat.
The 23rd-ranked Wolverines
started off slowly, but never
looked back once they got their
offense going, winning 61-43.
After a season-worst 27-per-
cent shooting from the field
against
Penn State, MICHIGAN 61
Michigan INDIANA 43
(5-1, 16-3)
found more success on offense,
shooting 42.6 percent from the
field.
"I thought we came out a lit-
tle tight," said Michigan coach
Kim Barnes Arico. "I don't
necessarily think we came out
ready to play from the get-go.
But after the first few minutes, I
think we woke up a little bit and
really started to play well and
(we) ended the first half strong.
And I really like how we came
out and started the second half
as well."
The Wolverines went into
halftime with a 13-point lead
and came out fast in the second
to build their lead to as much as
24.
But with 11 minutes remain-
ing, the Hoosiers went on a 10-0
run that stopped Michigan's
momentum and cut its lead to
13. After a timeout, the Wol-
verines continued to struggle,
enduring a 6:49 stretch without
scoring, but were able to pull
away in the end.
The last time these two
teams met, on Jan. 3, senior for-
ward Nya Jordan had a dou-
ble-double with 14 points and
12 rebounds., Tonight proved
no different, and Jordan ended
the game with 10 points and
added 11 rebounds. It was
the fourth time this year that
she has grabbed double-digit
rebounds.

talent, Robinson is proving to be
the most important Wolverine
freshman.
This weekit was the dunk over
Byrd; last week it was a 360-dunk
against Minnesota.
These highlight-reel plays are
what get the attention, but that's
not necessarily where Robinson's
value lies.
The hyper-athletic freshman
is leading the team in rebounds,
averaging even more than
McGary and redshirt junior Jor-
dan Morgan, two big men whose
biggest jobs are rebounding and
defense.
On Thursday, Robinson got
most of his nine boards from the
wing, from where he was able to
crash into the post. He's 6-foot-
6, but he's quick and agile, so
he gets his rebounds from out-
maneuvering, not out-muscling.
Offensively, he has the high-
est field-goal percentage of any-
one who isn't a post player on
the team, but his range extends
from the post to the 3-point line,
where he is shooting 41 percent.
He also plays like an upper-
classman, and is the calming

for his energy, his screams and
his frantic pump-up gestures to

Stauskas guarded Byrd in the
first half, but after leaving the
Boilermakers' second-leading
scorer open on, multiple occa-
sions,' the Michigan coaching
staff decided in the locker room
to let junior guard Tim Hard-
away Jr. defend Byrd. It worked,
as Byrd was held scoreless in the
second half, and Purdue failed to
connect on a single 3-point bas-
ket after halftime.
"Nik is improving like crazy
with his defense," Beilein said.
"But when he was guarding D.J.

Byrd, he forgot that D.J. Byrd is
him - he can shoot from deep.
"Tim has really become not
only really good at guarding the
particular person, but getting
Nik and everybody else, Glenn,
where they should be. ... When
D.J. Byrd got going, we just said,
'Alright, (Nik's) still a work in
process."
Burke paced Michigan in the
first half, scoring seven points
and adding four assists, but his
3-of-lO 3-point shooting and six
turnovers allowed the visiting
Boilermakers to not just keep
pace with the high-flying Wol-
verines, but enter halftime tied,
33-32.

The explosive, put-away-its-
opponent run came later than
expected for the No. 2 Michigan
basketball team. After all, the
Wolverines entered Thursday
night's game against Purdue as
decisive,_
double-dig- PURDU E 53
it favorites. MICHIGAN 68
But at
the 14:46 mark of the second half,
with the Wolverines trailing by a
point, freshman forward Glenn
Robinson III hit a 3-pointer that
would soon turn into 10 unan-
swered points for Michigan. By
time the run, which stretched to
14-2, ended, the Wolverines had
an 11-point lead and control of the
game, winning 68-53.
With the victory, Michigan
controls its fate heading into
Champaign on Sunday, where the
Wolverines will have the chance
to play for the presumptive No.
1 ranking. After No. 1 Duke fell
to No. 25 Miami on Wednesday,
a win over Illinois would almost
certainly place Michigan atop the
rankings for the first time since
Nov. 30, 1992, which came in the
midst of the Fab 5 era.
Robinson's 3 was followed by
a tip-in from freshman guard
Nik Stauskas. After a timeout,
sophomore point guard Trey
Burke connected on a 3-pointer
and Robinson followed with a
3-pointer of his own, which came
on the heels of a game-changing

play from freshman forward
Mitch McGary.
With the ball loose near half
court, McGary made a play that
Wolverine fans used to see from
another Chesterton, Ind. native,
former guard Zack Novak.
McGary out-jumped a Boiler-
maker, tipping the ball in the air,
and beat his opponent to the ball
downcourtbefore drawing a foul,
bringingthe crowd to its feet even
before he emphatically waved his
hands in the air at the student
section.
"Whether it's diving on the
floor, or going after something or
talking to the crowd - enhancing
the crowd's spirit, he's really good
at all of them," said Michigan.
coach John Beilein.
After the run ended, Purdue
was never able to regain the com-
posure it showed in the game's
first 25 minutes. Michigan out-
scored the Boilermakers in the
second half, 36-20.
"I wasn't crazy about some of
our poise in the first half," Beilein
said. "We tried to hit some home
runs instead of some singles. In
the second half, we really played
smart, both on offense and
defense."
Part of that turnaround can be
attributed to Beilein calling out
his team's mental toughness at
halftime.
"We're playing against better
and better teams,' which you're
going to see everyday in the Big
Ten," Beilein said. "Those days of
playing a team that maybe you can
go for some home runs and still
win, it doesn't work. We learned
that when we were in Columnbus."

to finish in double figures - while

Glenn Robinson III got the
ball on the wing, felt his man on
one side then spun his body the
other way. It took the freshman
forward two dribbles to get to
the edge of the key, where Pur-
due forward DJ Byrd tried to
meet him.
But Byrd can only rise so
high. Robinson can fly - Byrd
cannot.
Robinson hung in the air,
passing the inaptly named Byrd,
before viciously dunking the
ball with his right hand.
The St. John, Ind. native took
an extra second to hold onto
the rim, then shota look over to
Purdue's bench on his.way back
down the court.
Robinson has a relationship
with Purdue. It isn't just anoth-
er Big Ten school for him.
After No. 2 Michigan's 68-53
win over the Boilermakers,
Robinson was asked whether
the game was personal for him.
He looked down at the ground,
and paused for a couple sec-
onds before answering, "No,
I wouldn't say it got personal.
Nothing against (Purdue coach
Matt) Painter or Purdue."
After all, Purdue isthe school
his father played for back in
the early 1990s, the school that*
Glenn "Big Dog" Robinson aver-
aged more than 30 points a
game for and the school where
the older Robinson played
alongside Painter for a year.
Robinson went on to be the
No. 1 overall pick in the NBA
Draft, where he had an 11-year
career. It made sense that Pur-

due was one of the interested
schools when it came time for
the recruitment of the younger
Robinson.
You'd think that an Indiana
native would wind up at the
alma mater of his father, the
former NBA All-Star, who just
so happened to play with the
current head coach. That would
make sense.
But Purdue ran out of schol-
arships, and Robinson commit-
ted to Michigan and coach John
Beilein.
So it's hard to believe the
game wasn't a little personal for
Robinson, playing his father's
team - the team that couldn't
take him on.
"He might not say this, but
it's personal for all of us guys
from Indiana," said freshman
forward Mitch McGary, anoth-
er Indiana native. "They all talk
smack if they beat us because
we're from Indiana and we
came here to Michigan. So, we
have to win."
Purdue or not, Robinson
turned in another efficient
night. He scored 12 points,
including two 3-pointers, and
missed only two 'shots to go
along with his game-high nine
rebounds.
He also played a team-high 37
minutes, often rotating from the
wing to the post depending on
the other Wolverine personnel
on the floor.
"Tonight, he just had the
urgency," McGary said. "Not
just with the dunk, but he hita
couple 3s and-was crashing the
glass all night."
On ateam loaded with young

double-double, putting up 12
points and nine rebounds and
another highlight-reel dunk.
"I like making those high-
lights, getting the crowd excited,"
Robinson said. "It feelsgood to do
that.... We all got excited, wanted
to play defense."
Uncharacteristic of past
Michigan-Purdue games, the
Wolverines outrebounded the,
Boilermakers, 35-29, while out-
scoring them inthe paint, 36-24.
But the first half was a very
different story than the latter
half. Just 1:15 into the game, after
Burke beat the Purdue defense
to the basket for an uncontested
layup, Boilermakers coach Matt
Painter called atimeout. Knowing

the explosive offensive capabil-
ity the Wolverines have displayed
time and time again this season,
Painter sensed that Burke's layup
- which gave Michigan a5-3 lead
- could springboard into an early
blowout, so he called timeout.
It proved to be a good move,
as the two teams changed leads
eight times in the first half, and
Purdue gave the Wolverines their
first halftime deficit at home this
season.
The story of the opening stan-
za was the Boilermakers' 3-point
shooting. Led by guard D.J.
Byrd's three first-half 3-pointers,
Purdue shot 7-of-13 from deep in
the half.
