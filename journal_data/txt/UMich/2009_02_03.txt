Granholm expected
to call for steady
tuition rates in
exchange for funding
By KYLE SWANSON
Daily StaffReporter
In her annual State of the State
address tonight, Michigan Gov.
Jennifer Granholm is expected to
ask state colleges not to raise stu-
dent tuition next year.
But University officials aren't
making any promises.
In an interview yesterday, Vice
Provost for Academic and Budget-
ary Affairs Philip Hanlon said he
wasn't yet aware of the specifics
of Granholm's plan. He said the
University hasn't determined if a
tuition increase will be necessary
next year.
"We don't actuallyhave thespe-
cifics of what Granholm is going
to propose, but we look forward
to learning more from her address
tomorrow evening," Hanlon said.
Granholm is expected to call
for a tuition freeze at all state
schools in exchange for increases
in state funding and additional
money from the stimulus pack-
age currently being considered by

the U.S; Senate. Granholm is also
expected to penalize schools that
raise tuition by decreasing state
aid and possibly redirecting stim-
ulus money.
Last year Granholm made a
similar call to universities, ask-
ing them to cap tuition increases
to the rate of inflation, then 2.3
percent. Granholm had planned
to give universities a 3-percent
increase in state funding last year,
but the legislature reduced that
amount to a 1-percent increase.
When asked whether the Uni-
versity would raise tuition next
year, Hanlon would not comment,
saying it was too early in the bud-
get process to speculate about pos-
sible tuition increases.
"We're in the very early stages
of developing next year's budgets
so we're still trying to understand
our costincreases,"hesaid. "We're
working really hard on expendi-
ture reduction efforts and we're
also watching next year's enroll-
ment very closely. Those are all
very crucial things to our budget
for next year."
Although it's early in the bud-
get process, Hanlon said the Uni-
versity understands the economic
difficulties families are facing and
will make financial aid a major
priority.

Owner says he
doesn't know when
or where restaurant
will reopen
By MATT AARONSON
Daily StaffReporter
Red Hot Lovers used to be cam-
pus's main destination for authentic
Chicago-style hot dogs and late-
night chili cheese waffle fries on a
drunken stumble home. But since
the beginning of this semester,

the hopes of hungry students have
been deflated by the scene at 629 E.
University Ave.: stools upside down
on tables, lights out and no one in
sight.
The closing is only temporary,
though, according to Troy Slade,
the restaurant's owner. Slade said
he closed Red Hot Lovers for winter
break, planning to open again when
classes resumed, but an unforeseen
conflictwiththe building's landlord
has putcthings on hold. Slade said he
intends to reopen but doesn't know
when or where.
"We will be somewhere in Ann
Arbor, on campus," he said. "We're

not going anywhere."
Slade said his landlord, Dick
Johnston, has offered him a one-
year extension for his lease, which
ends in about three months. With-
out a lease offer of at least five
years, though, Slade said he'll start
looking for a new home for the res-
taurant.
Johnston could not be reached
for comment.
Operations at the restaurant
were suspended because Slade
didn't want to invest in a location
that he might be vacating soon.
"The place is old, and a lot of
the equipment needs fixing up,"

he said.
Slade expects a decision from
Johnston this week about the lease
and said that although he would
prefer not to move, there's "a ton of
locations" where landlords would
be "thrilled to have a tenant like
Red Hot's."
"I'm sure if I moved it to South
University (Avenue) people would
go nuts," he said. "They'd love it."
Slade said it doesn't make sense
for any new business owner, espe-
cially one who wants to expand, to
take the risks involved with short-
term lease commitments.

Student governments hold forum

Though few turned

many questions
By DANIEL STRAUSS
Daily StaffReporter
Five student governments met in
a town hall style forum last night to
field questions and complaints from
University students.
Despite a low turnout, represen-
tatives from LSA Student Govern-
ment, the Student-Athlete Advisory
Council, Michigan Student Assem-
bly, the Residence Halls Associa-

many questions from the roughly

Tonight's fundraiser
put on by athletic
teams will benefit
two charities
By ELYANA TWIGGS
For the Daily
A decade after Mock Rock
began, the student-athlete variety
show is returning for yet another
year to raise money for C.S. Mott

Children's Hospital and a local arts
program for adolescents. The show
will feature 19 athletic teams - the
largest number in the program's
history - and is expected to raise
at least $55,000 for charity.
Michigan football legend and
Heisman trophy winner Desmond
Howard will emcee the event.
The fundraiser, which will be
held tonight at Hill Auditorium, is
an annual event put on by the Stu-
dent-Athlete Advisory Council that
features the University's varsity
athletes competing in various tal-

ent competitions. At the end of the
show, the audience will choose the
winner by sending a text message
with their votes.
Last year, the event raised
around $40,000. This year's goal
is $80,000, and SAAC has raised
about $55,000 so far, with the bulk
of funds coming from sponsorships
and personal donations. Tickets to
the event are $10.
In past years, athletic teams
would only sell tickets but now
student-athletes are more actively
participating in the fundraising

process by collecting individual
donations.
Laura Dunn, a Mock Rock co-
chair and secretary of the Student-
Athlete Advisory Council, said she
is amazed at what the athletes have
already accomplished.
"The athletes feel a certain con-
nection to the event," Dunn said.
"The event is all about athletics and
all about community."
Dunn said she was proud of the
program's efforts to support the
community.

It's always sunny in Blue Front

When you walk into Blue
Front at 701 Packard St.,
between the freezers of beer
and the shelves of wine is the
friendly face and warm smile of
Sunny Bhagat, the convenience
store's owner.
Sunny, who has been in busi-
ness in Ann Arbor for almost
three years, provides "thirsty"
University students with their
supplies of beer and wine.
Budweiser is the most popu-
lar beer he sells, "but girls like
the light (beer)," Bhagat said.
For students in the market for
wine, Bhagat said Franzia is his
top-seller.
While Sunny's disposition
is literally as nice as his name
denotes, don't think a McLovin-
style fake ID can fool him. He
said he can tell when an under-
age student is lying when they
"try to hide their eyes" and

"look down."
"If they are talking too much,
it means they are a minor," he
said.
Bhagat said he mostly turns
down underage students at the
start of the semester, when they
come into his store naive and
hopingto get lucky.
By the time the semester is in
full swing, though, Bhagat said
that he knows 95 percent of his
customers on a "face-to-face"
basis.
When Sunny forces a student
to do the walk of shame out of
his store empty handed, he does
it tastefully, with a mere, "I'm
sorry," he said.
"I like the students of Michi-
gan," Bhagat said.
In the past three years he has
been in Ann Arbor, he said he
has "never had a problem."
"All (students) are friendly,

all are smiley, there is no fight-
ing, no arguing, nothing," he
said.
Not only does Bhagat enjoy
having students as his custom-
ers, but he said he also loves
being a part of Ann Arbor.
The best part about Ann
Arbor, Bhagat said, is that he
doesn't have to worry about
crime.
"This is a nice town," he said.
On football Saturdays, once
all his pre-game customers have
purchased their kegs, cups and
ping-pong balls, Bhagat said he
walks to the stadium among the
students he loves.
"Football time," he said, is his
favorite thing about working on
a college campus.
Bhagat, who came from India
in 1995, lives in Canton, Mich.
He has two sons and a daughter.

attack on hospital
COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) - A
mother and father lay on the floor,
their two young children cradled
between them. Floral pillows and
other bedding were strewn about:
They were apparently sleeping
when an artillery shell hit their
makeshift shelter in northern Sri
Lanka, instantly killing them all.
This photo, taken Jan. 23, along
with other pictures and video foot-
age taken last week were given to
The Associated Press by indepen-
dent observers. They offer a rare
glimpse of the growing toll the
civil war has taken on the estimat-
ed 250,000 civilians trapped in the
all-but-sealed conflict zone.
The images show that despite
repeated government denials, civil-
ians are being killed and maimed in
the fighting.
Some of the victims were
attacked inside a government-
declared "safe zone" in rebel-held
territory and the wounded were
brought to the nearby Puthukkudi-
yiruppu hospital, which itself has
come under attack.

The hospital, overflowing with
wounded civilians, was shelled
Monday for the fourth time in two
days, killing two patients, said
Kandasamy Tharmakulasingham,
a government health official. A
total of 11 people have been killed
since the first attack on the hospital
Sunday afternoon, he said.
One of the last working medical
institutions in the region, the hos-
pital lies outside the "safe zone"
the government established Jan. 21
inside rebel territory as a refuge for
civilians. The government pledged
not to attack the safe area during its
offensive against the rebels, but it
has come under repeated artillery
attack, according to local health
officials and human rights groups.
Governmenttroopshavebrought
the Tamil Tiger rebels to the brink
of defeat in recent months, forcing
them out of much of the de facto
state they once controlled in the
north, capturing their administra-
tive capital and shattering their
dream of establishing a separate
homeland for minority Tamils. The
offensive has also raised growing
concerns about the fate of civilians
in the war zone.
Journalists and most aid groups
have been barred from the area
of the fighting, but independent

observers shot video footage and
photographs over the past week
and provided them to The Associ-
ated Press. The observers provided
the images on conditiontheynotbe
identified because they feared gov-
ernment reprisal.
The photograph of the slain fam-
ilywastakenintheearlymorningof
Jan. 23 in the village of Udayarkat-
tu inside the "safe zone," according
to the observer who took the pic-
ture. It showed the bloodiedbodies
of a woman, two young children
and a man lying among brightly
colored floral pillows, a green mat,
striped sheets and other bedding. A
bicycle, stacked blankets and other
household items could be seen in
the background.
An artilleryshell struck between
two makeshift shelters where peo-
ple displaced by the fighting were
staying and the family of four was
killed instantly, the observer said.
A second photo showed the body of
a woman wearing a red-and-white
checked dress lying face down
under debris in another shelter
nearby.

week, showed Puthukkudiyiruppu

severely wounded people, includ-

NEWS BRIEFS
WASHINGTON
Officials say Obama
to nominate Gregg
for commerce spot
President Barack Obama plans to
nominate Sen. Judd Gregg as com-
merce secretary on Tuesday, the
White House confirmed on the eve
of the announcement as the New
Hampshire Republican disclosed
an apparent deal that would keep
his seat out of Democratic hands.
"I have made it clear to the Sen
ate leadership on both sides of the
aisle and to the governor that I
would not leave the Senate if I felt
my departure would cause a change
inthe makeup of the Senate," Gregg
said Monday in a statement. The
White House confirmed the Gregg
choice on the condition of anonim-
ity because the announcement had
not yet been made.
New Hampshire Gov. John
Lynch confirmed the "understand-
log," stopping just short of prom-
ising to appoint a Republican or
an independent to serve out the
remaining two years of Gregg's
term.
The deal would give Obama his
top choice for a team tasked with
steering the nation out of reces-
sion. Republicans get to keep
Gregg's seat for two more years,
retaining the crucial 41 Senate
seats they need to filibuster major-
ity Democrats.
ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia
Dismay as Gadhafi
chosen to lead
African Union
Moammar Gadhafi of Libya
was elected Monday as leader of
the African Union, a position long
sought by the eccentric dictator
who wants to push his oil-rich
nation into the international main-
stream after years of isolation.
Gadhafi, once ostracized by the
West for sponsoring terrorism, has
been trying to increase both Lib-
ya's global stature and its regional
influence - mediating African
conflicts, sponsoring efforts to
spread Islam on the continent and
pushing for the creation of a single
African government.
Still, some African leaders
offered tepid praise for the choice
of the strongman who. grabbed
power in a 1969 coup. Rights
groups called him a poor model
for Africa at a time when demo-
cratic gains are being reversed in
countries such as Mauritania and
Guinea.
CHICAGO
Wisecracking
mobster Joey the
Clown gets life term
Reputed mob boss Joseph "Joey
the Clown" Lombardo was sen-
tenced Monday to life in federal
prison for serving as a leader of Chi-
cago's organized crime family and
the murder of a government witness
in a union pension fraud case.
Lombardo, 80, was among three

reputed mob bosses and two alleged
henchmen convicted in September
2007 at the landmark Operation
Family Secrets trial which lifted the
curtain of secrecy from the seamy
operations of Chicago's underworld.
"The worst things you have done
are terrible and I see no regret in
them," U.S. District Judge James
B. Zagel said in imposing sentence.
He also sentenced Lombardo sepa-
rately to 168 months for going on
Sthe lam for eight months after he
was charged.

Congressional
agency miscounts
Dingell record date
U.S. Rep. John Dingell has
received a recount, and it means
he'll set a longevity record three
days earlier than thought.
The U.S. House historian's office
says the 82-year-old Dearborn
Democrat will become the longest
serving member Feb. 11, 2009. That
will be his 19,420th day in office.
The current record-holder is ex-
Rep. Jamie Whitten, D-Miss., who
died in 1995.
The Congressional Research
Service earlier said Dingell would
break the record Feb. 14.
Dingell's office said Monday the
historian's office and the research
service found a mistake in the
count of how many days Dingell
had served.
He was first elected Dec. 13, 1955.

Mullen: Afghanistan is no Vietnam

Pentagon to deploy
additional 15,000
troops this spring
WASHINGTON (AP) - The top
U.S.military officer cautioned Mon-
day against comparing the Penta-
gon'srenewedfocusonAfghanistan
to the Vietnam War, citing terror-
ism and a non-occupation strategy
as "dramatic differences" between
the two conflicts.
"Afghanistan is much more com-
plex," said Navy Adm. Mike Mul-
len, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff.
He added: "I certainly recog-
nize - and having been in Viet-
nam myself - that there are those
who make comparisons. I would be
pretty careful about that though,
for lots of reasons."
Mullen's comments came as the

and summer in the Obama adminis-
tration's military campaign to shut
down the Taliban and al-Qaida.
Ultimately, an estimated 60,000
U.S. troops could be in Afghanistan
over the next year as Obama starts
ordering soldiers from Iraq. There
are currently about 32,000 Ameri-
can troops in Afghanistan.
Speaking to a Washington meet-
ing of the Reserve Officers Asso-
ciation, Mullen stopped short of
predicting how long U.S. troops
would remain in Afghanistan. He
said the main difference between
Afghanistan and Vietnam is that
"we are not an occupying force."
"We have no intention of that,"
Mullen said. "There isn't any of the
42-plus countries who are there
that have that intention. ... That
said, we cannot send a message to

the Afghan people that we are."
Chief among the concerns, Mul-
len said, is makingsure Afghanistan
never again becomes a safe haven
for al-Qaida leaders who moved to
lawless Pakistan tribal regions in
the post-9/11 hunt for Osama bin
Laden.
"We cannot accept that al-Qaida
leadership which continues to plan
against us every single day - and I
mean us, here in America - to have
that safe haven in Pakistan nor
could resume one in Afghanistan,"
Mullen said.
Efforts to eliminate govern-
ment corruption and develop the
poor nation also marks a con-
trast between the U.S. mission in
Afghanistan from Vietnam, Mullen
said.
Defense Secretary Robert Gates
met Monday with President Barack
Obama, but White House spokes-
man Robert Gibbs would not say

whether the two discussed troop
levels in Afghanistan..
Meanwhile, the Pentagon
released a long-awaited study Mon-
day describing crumbling security
and a peak in violence in Afghani-
stan in spring and summer of 2008.
Reacting to the study, House
Armed Services Committee Chair-
man Ike Skelton, D-Mo., said in
a statement that the situation in
Afghanistan is troubling and will
need more time and effort.
"The mission in Afghanistan
continues to be limited by short-
falls in both military and civilian
resources," Skelton said. "The prob-
lems are manifold: too few trainers
and mentors for the Afghan Nation-
al Security Forces; pervasive cor-
ruption and alack of leadership and
human capital within the Govern-
ment of Afghanistan; slow progress
in economic reconstruction and
in the counternarcotics fight; and

the ongoing existence of insurgent
safe havens along the border with
Pakistan, one of the greatest chal-
lenges to long-term security in the
region."
The quarterly status report,
required by Congress, focused
mostly on data available between
April and September 2008 but
included some year-end details,
including:
-Between January and Decem-
ber 10, 2008, 132 U.S. personnel in
Afghanistan died as the result of
hostile action, up from 82 in 2007.
-The Afghan National Army Air
Corps is beefing up its reconnais-
sance and gunship fleets and added
27 new helicopters and cargo planes
by the end of December.
-As of December, NATO had
provided only 42 Operational Men-
tor Liaison Teams out of 103 prom-
ised to train the Afghan National
Security Forces.

Senate confirms
Eric Holder as
first black AG

owned by Russell Justice yesterday at the quarry in Danville, KY.
FEMA gets decent m -arks
for ice stor-m response.

Former prosecutor,
judge confirmed
with 75-21 vote
WASHINGTON (AP) - Eric
Holder won Senate confirmation .
Monday as the nation's first Afri-
can-American attorney general,
after supporters from both parties
touted his dream resume and easily
overcameRepublicanconcernsover
his commitment to fight terrorism
and his unwillingness to back the
right to keep and bear arms.
The vote was 75-21, with all the
opposition coming from Republi-
cans.
Holder's chief supporter, Sen.
Patrick Leahy, said the confir-
mation was a fulfillment of civil
rights leader Martin Luther
King's dream that everyone
would be judged by the content of
their character.
"Come on the right side of his-
tory;" said Leahy, D-Vt., chairman
of the Judiciary Committee.
Holder becomes the only black
in the Obama administration in
what has traditionally been known*
as the president's Cabinet. Three
other African-Americans have
been chosen for top administration
positions that hold the same rank.
Holder was a federal prosecu-
tor, judge and the No. 2 Justice
Department official in the Clinton
administration. Even his critics
agreed that Holder was well-qual-
ified, but they questioned his posi-
tions and independence.

The debate turned partisan in
its first moments, when Leahy,
expressed anger that a few Repub-
licans demanded a pledge from
Holder that he wouldn't prosecute
intelligence agents who participat-
ed in harsh interrogations.
Leahy singled out Texas Repub-
lican John Cornyn as one who
wanted to "turn a blind eye to pos-
sible lawbreaking before investi-
gating whether it occurred."
"No one should be seeking to
trade a vote for such a pledge,"
Leahy said.
When Cornyn rose to announce
his vote against Holder, he did not
make such a demand. However,
he accused the nominee of chang-
ing his once-supportive position
- on the need to detain terrorism
suspects without all the rights
of the Geneva Convention - to
one of harshly criticizingBush
administration's counterterror-
ism policies.
"His contrasting positions from
2002 to 2008 make me wonder if
this is the same person," Cornyn
said. "It makes me wonder what he
truly believes."
Cornyn and Sen. Tom Coburn
said Holder was hostile to the
right of individuals to own guns,
despite a Supreme Court ruling
last June affirming the right to
have weapons for self-defense in
the home.
Holder said at his confirmation
hearings: "I understand that the
Supreme Court has spoken." But
he added that some restrictions on
guns could still be legal.

Death toll raised to
24 in Kentucky,
55 nationwide
EDDYVILLE, Ky. (AP) - In the
first real test of the Obama admin-
istration's ability to respond to a
disaster, Kentucky officials are
giving the federal government
good marks for its response to a
deadly ice storm.
Yet more than 300,000 resi-
dents remained without power
Monday and some areas had yet
to see aid workers nearly a week
after the storm, a fact not lost on
some local authorities.
"We haven't seen FEMA. They
haven't been here," said Jaime
Green, a spokeswoman for the
emergency operations center
in Lyon County, about 95 miles
northwest of Nashville, Tenn.
Federal authorities insisted
they responded as soon as the
state asked for help and promised
to keep providing whatever aid
was necessary.
FEMA has been under the
microscope since the Bush admin-

istration's botched response
to Hurricane Katrina in 2005,
which" Barack~Obama and other
Democrats made a favorite topic
on the presidential campaign
trail. FEMA was reorganized and
strengthened after that, and it has
avoided the onslaught of negative
feedback Katrina generated.
The agency hasn't been tested
the same way it was after the hur-
ricane, however.
Gov. Steve Beshear raised Ken-
tucky's death toll to 24 on Mon-
day, meaning the storm has been
blamed in at least 55 deaths nation-
wide. And while it also knocked out
power to more than a million cus-
tomers from the Southern Plains to
the East Coast, it's still considered
a medium-sized disaster, the kind
FEMA has traditionally been suc-
cessful handling.
The Kentucky disaster w.ill
be closely watched, said Rich-
ard Sylves, professor of politi-
cal science at the University of
Delaware, particularly because
Obama hasn't yet named the top
FEMA officials, many of whom
must go through Senate confir-
mation.

"If it's perceived not to be
handled very well, or if there's
a sense that there's-insensitivity
at the federal level to the plight
of people suffering, I imagine
the people President Obama has
appointed to senior positions in
FEMA will be grilled in their con-
firmation hearings," said Sylves,
who has written four books on
federal disaster policy.
Beshear asked Obama for a
disaster declaration to free up fed-
eral assistance Thursday, two days
after the storm hit, and Obama
issued it hours later. Trucks load-
ed with supplies began arriving at
a staging area at Fort Campbell,
Ky., on Friday morning, said Mary
Hudak, a spokeswoman for the
Federal Emergency Management
Agency.
On Saturday, Beshear ordered
all of the state's Army National
Guardsmen into action to distrib-
ute supplies, many of which came
from FEMA.
Beshear has consistently
praised Obama, a fellow Demo-
crat, for the attention he's devoted
to what Beshear calls the biggest
natural disaster to hit his state.

Maritime colleges to train
sailors in fight against pirates

298 piracy incidents
reported in 2008
PORTLAND, Maine (AP) -
With an alarming number of tank-
ers and cargoshipsgettinghijacked
on the high seas, the nation's mari-
time academies are offering more
training to merchant seamen in
how to fend off attacks from pirates
armed not with cutlasses and flint-
locks but automatic weapons and
grenade launchers.
Collegesareteachingstudentsto
fishtail their vessels at high speed,
drive off intruders with high-pres-
sure water hoses and illuminate
their decks with floodlights.
Anti-piracy training is not
new. Nor are the techniques. But
the lessons have taken on new
urgency - and more courses are
planned - because of the record
number of attacks worldwide in
2008 by outlaws who seize ships
and hold them for ransom.
At the California Maritime Acad-
emy in Vallejo, Calif., professor
Donna Nincic teaches two courses
on piracy. Students learn where the
piracy hotspots are and how they
have shifted over the years.

"If I've done anything, I've
shown them that this isn't a joke,
it's not about parrots and eye
patches and Blackbeard and all
that," Nincic said. "It's very real
and it's a problem without an easy
solution."
Emily Rizzo, a student at the
MassachusettsMaritimeAcademy
in Buzzards Bay, Mass., worked
aboard a 760-foot cargo ship last
year as part of her training. As the
vessel sailed the Malacca Straits
in Southeast Asia, she served on
"pirate watches," learned to use
hoses and took part in drills with
alarms indicating the ship had
been boarded.
The training "brought to light
just how serious it is," said Rizzo,
a 22-year-old senior from Milwau-
kee. "The pirates can get on board
these huge ships and they know
whatthey're doing. It's not like the
old days."
The International Maritime
Bureau reported 293 piracy inci-
dents in 2008, an increase of 11
percent from the year before. For-
ty-nine vessels were hijacked, and
889 crew members were taken
hostage. Eleven were killed and
21 reported missing and presumed

dead, according to the bureau.
Piracy hotspots have been iden-
tified offEastAfrica and in South-
east Asia, South America and the
Caribbean.
Typically, small numbers of
pirates - as few as two and up
to 15 or 16 - draw up alongside
ships in motorized skiffs and use
grappling hooks and rope ladders
to clamber aboard. Some of the
biggest ships might have no more
than two dozen crew members.
often the pirates are armed
with knives and guns. Pirates off
the coast of Somalia have taken
to firing automatic weapons and
rocket-propelled grenades.
In the old days, ships were
armed with cannons to guard
against pirates. But nowadays,
crew members for the most part
do not carry guns. And maritime
instructors say that arming crews
is not the answer.
It is illegal for crews to carry
weapons in the territorial waters
of many nations, and ship captains
are wary of armingcrew members
for fear of mutinies, Nincic said.
Also, some worry that arming
crew members would only cause
the violence to escalate.

Unstated rules
'U' must establish clear rules for judging residency status
Y ou might have a driver's license registered in this state.
You might pay taxes here. You might work here, live
here, get married here and say "pop" instead of soda. But
according to vague and inconsistent residency standards here at
the University, this doesn't mean you necessarily qualify for in-
state tuition. So what does? The truth is that, outside of the office
of the Registrar, no one really knows. The state of uncertainty
regarding residency status needs to change - the policy must be
standardized and widely publicized so that all prospective stu-
dents are aware if they qualify for in-state tuition.

Recession and depression myths

4

Last week, the Detroit News ran an arti-
cle about Keiva Shults, an Ann Arbor resi-
dent who has lived here, paid taxes here
and worked here for the past five years.
But when she applied to the University's
graduate program for nursing, she was
told that she was considered a Maryland
resident and would be charged out-of-state
tuition, regardless of the fact that she has
been living in this state for an extended
period of time. Shults fits the most basic
requirements to be qualified as a resident
of the state, yet she still was denied in-state
status. If Shults is not considered a resident
by the University, who is?
Unfortunately, situations like Shults's are
not uncommon. In fall 2007, the registrar's
office processed 1,941 residency requests
and denied 346. According to University
Regent S. Martin Taylor, who was quoted
in the Detroit News story, the University
judges these residency requests on a case-
by-case, "highly subjective basis." This is
especially concerning when taking into
account the fact that out-of-state under-
graduates pay about three times more in
tuition. And for many, residency status
could determine whether or not they can
afford to attend school at all.
Policies for determining residency at
the University need to be transparent and
available for any student with questions.

In order for this to happen, there needs to
be a standardized, fair and objective set of
guidelines in place to determine residency
status. What's more, students need to be
aware of this standard when making their
education plans.
The University might think higher
tuition is in its financial best interests, but
this campus will end up losing students
with great potential who just can't afford
the out-of-state bill. And since tuition
keeps rising while the availability of finan-
cial aid and scholarships steadily declines,
the University should be focusing as much
attention as possible on making education
affordable for everyone.
This is a problem that has existed, and
will continue to exist, until University offi-'
cials and the Board of Regents provide a
clearly defined system.
Most public universities share Michi-
gan's inability to explicitly explain what
qualifies a student's residency, but that
doesn't mean we should keep up the trend.
There is no reason for students to have to
wonder whether they will be classified
as in-state or out-of-state. It's up to the
Regents to put the question of residency
status to rest by establishing a rule that
makes sense, because making residency
decisions on a "highly subjective basis"
isn't good enough.

With the nation in the grips
of a failing economy, the
Obama administration is
prepared to step up
the government's
fight against a pos-
sible Great Depres-
sion II. The types
of solutions that
the government is
considering, how-
ever, are the exact
same mistakes that
caused and wors- VINCENT
ened the first Great PATSY
Depression, when
Herbert Hoover
and Franklin
Roosevelt turned an acute recession
into a chronic depression. The popu-
lar history of the Great Depression
goes as follows: the Roaring Twenties
were a period of unrestricted laissez-
faire capitalism, which naturally
became unbalanced, and the unwise
policies of quiescent Hoover caused
the system to fail and created a mas-
sive depression. The depression was
solved by Roosevelt's policies of gov-
ernment intervention into the econo-
my and the onset of World War II.
Thankfully, most of that tale is
completely false.
The Roaring Twenties was not a
period of unrestricted, laissez-faire
capitalism, mainly because the Fed-
eral Reserve and other central banks
around the world poured in tons of
easy credit. Much like the current cri-
sis, when any central bank expands
credit (lowers the interest rate), it
causes disturbances for investors who
then misallocate capital into unprofit-
able investments or malinvestments.
The malinvestments usually occur in
the stock and real estate market, and
would not have been undertaken if it
were not for the interest rate expan-
sion. When the central bank attempts
to slow the pace of the credit expan-
sion, like the Federal Reserve did in
1928, the bubble bursts and causes a
stock market crash, a decline in real
estate prices and a general financial
panic. Artificial credit expansion

throughout the Roaring Twenties led
to phony prosperity not as a result of
laissez-faire capitalism, but rather
because of government interference
into the market.
Electedin1928,HerbertHooverand
his policies were the most interven-
tionist in U.S. history. His program to
end the Depression included keeping
food prices and wages artificially high,
propping up weak firms, construct-
ing massive public works (ever heard
of the Hoover Dam?), implementing
monetary expansion and enforcing
protectionism as evidenced by the
Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act. These types
of policies have become standard pro-
cedure by the federal government
during recessions, so this has become
what people view as laissez-faire capi-
talism. But the free-market position
on recessions is to stop inflating the
bubble by raising interests, decreasing
the size of government and allowing
malinvestments to become liquidated.
Only by following this path will the
recession be eliminated and not just
papered over.
Comparable in size to the stock
market crash of 1929 and the result-
ing monetary contraction, the 1839-
43 Depression also saw a rise in
consumption (21 percent) and Gross
National Product (16 percent). In the
1839-43 Depression, there was no
"federal response" and the economy
healed much faster. But during the
1929-33 contraction, with Herbert
Hoover's proto-New Deal policies in
place, there was a decrease in con-
sumption (-19 percent) and GNP (-30
percent).
Franklin Roosevelt merely expand-
ed the Hoover playbook and with
similar results. FDR not only failed
to solve the Great Depression, he also
doubled the public debt. In 1932, FDR
inherited an unemployment rate of
25 percent - in 1938, it was still 19
percent. His plans never worked at
solving the crisis for a simple rea-
son: government cannot produce
new resources; they can only employ
resources that are already produced.
By taxing and spending, the govern-

ment shifts resources from private
usage to public usage. All that the
New Deal programs accomplished
was a shift of resources from one
group of taxpayers to another.
The last aspect of the Great
Depression Myth is the belief that
World War II "got us out of it." This
makes even less sense than believing
in the success of the New Deal - at
least New Deal programs did not
destroy resources. When we built
massive fleets and sent them into the
middle of the Pacific to get destroyed,
as we did in World War II, we did not
create jobs. This was an economic
Gov't intervention

waste, with labor and material being
emiployed for purposes other than
usage by the general public. We are
now worse off because that steel and
electronic equipment is at the bottom
of the ocean and not part of trains,
radios or consumer goods.
The Depression ended because of
the destruction of most of the world's
industrial base, a repeal of most New
Deal-era programs and a return to
normal production following the
war. Recessions cannot be cured or
fought, but are just the result of an
earlier phase of malinvestments that
need to be liquidated.
So now we are left with the unfor-
tunate situation where the federal
government is determined to stop the
Second Great Depression by repeat-
ing the same interventionist mistakes
that they committed in the 1930s. But
perhaps this time we can convince
them to allow the market to heal
itself, and not begin a decade long
economic slump.

Drawing complaints

This viewpoint was submitted as a rebuttal
to last week's Letter to the Editor by Alexander
Vilagosh (Daily acted irresponsibly by running
cartoon, 01/29/09).
In response to Elaine Morton's recent cartoon
(Nature Calls, 12/08/2008), it was irresponsible
and dangerous for the Daily to publish a cartoon
that anthropomorphized Christmas trees; this
gives a false representation of the issues behind
protecting the environment.
Christmas trees still lingering in the homes
of Ann Arbor's environmentally unconscious
were purchased from a tree lot or cut from the
pristine wilderness. Thus, these trees had no
potential of ever being "human" - no more so
than any tree you might stumble upon while
taking your dog or significant other for a walk
through our beloved Arboretum. By anthro-
pomorphizing the trees, the cartoon implied
that they have the feelings and emotions of
a human. After one to five years of growth
(the point at which many pine trees are cut to
become Christmas trees), this is simply not the
case.
While many would try to draw links between
this debate and the global warming debate,
they are two completely separate issues. It

is unknown whether pine trees, or any type
of tree for that matter, develop emotions to a
level at which they can be considered human
and have a right to life. But that point certain-
ly does not occur within the one to five years
before they are cut for the Christmas season.
Of course there is also the fact that a tree could
never "be human" anyway, though I do not
believe the cartoonist was going for scientific
accuracy.
Using artificial trees and turning off Christ-
mas lights after the celebration of the Epiphany
on Jan. 6 might quell the onslaught of climate
change. But research on these issues requires
the support of the general population so that
appropriate funding can be allocated to these
environmental programs. The good that can
come from this research far outweighs the bad.
Making Christmas trees have human charac-
teristics - even in a cartoon - could influence
understanding of the issue without factual
basis. While I do not believe this was the inten-
tion of Elaine Morton, the cartoon's potential
effect on public perception should have been
considered.

et's talk about the Acad-
emy Awards. Yes, the
awards show that I still
believe is a useful public service
announce- _
ment about
classic films
for mass
consumption.
The Academy
has awarded
"The Godfa-
ther," "Life BLAKE
is Beautiful," GOBLE
"The Apart-
ment," "All Quiet on the West-
ern Front" and a bevy of other
historic films that most people
would never see had the Oscar
not stepped in. Nah, popcorn art
like "Fight Club" will never win
Oscars, but did it stay with you the
way "The Departed" has?
2009's nominations came
out last month, and despite the
snubs and seriousness, I'm still
looking forward to seeing how
this year's awards are a little bit
worse than the last. I love the
Oscars.
Somebody recently asked me,
"Why care about something that
recognized 'The Reader'?" Fair
enough. Yes, we're also going to
have to look at Brad Pitt's pen-
sive face for five hours. And yes,
"Wall-E" didn't get a best picture
nod (I kinda hated it anyway).
And even with the "Dark Knight"
being looked down upon, Harvey
Weinstein playing linebacker and
"Let the Right One In" not getting
tapped for best foreign film, I'm
still stoked. Why? I love to com-
plain, and I love the Academy.
Obscene celebrities, fashion,
gossip, speeches and, above all,
the awards themselves make it
worthwhile. As screenwriting
nominee Simon Beaufoy ("Slum-
dog Millionaire") said, everyone
secretly wants to win an Oscar.
It's worth a damn. It's just that the
broadcast has been getting lousier
each year for a number of reasons.
Length, self-gratifyingstars, bad
writing and award-hog films like
"The Return of the King" all add
to the problem.
That's why the Academy is in
dire need of a tune-up. If it doesn't
want to get edged out by the Inde-
pendent Spirit Awards, People's
Choice or some other kiddy-sized
gala, things have to change. Now.
There's nothing we can do about
this year's nominations; we'll just
have to respect that "Milk" and
"The Dark Knight" pulled out
eight each, which is pretty awe-
some. ButI have demands.
First: a good host. In the last
decade, we've seen everyone
from Whoopi Goldberg to Conan
O'Brien to Jon Stewart host the
Awards, and the same thing was
said of each MC: "Good, but not
great."
No real standout could be found
amongrecenthosts. Billy Crystal?
He's too corny to be a great host.
That's why we need another John-
ny Carson - a man or woman
who could host the show enough
times to be well recognized for it.
With Hugh Jackman ("X-Men")
hosting, this could be the Oscar's
chance. With Jackman's stage
skills, leading presence and goof-
ball Aussie humor, he might be the
surprise the event is looking for.

If not, let's re-animate Carson
next year.
Next, more booze. Love 'em or
hate 'em, the 66th Annual Golden
Globes this year were prime blog
real estate. Why? Everyone was
loaded. And we all heard about it.
Now, that's not meant to condone
hard swigging to produce stream-
of-consciousness speeches (see:
Colin Farrell). But it did make the
proceedings ashell of a lot more
interesting.
Between David Duchovny
being morbid, Tracy Jordan get-
ting ripped and Darren Aranofksy
flipping the bird, it was a really
great yet weird Globes show this
year. So bring all that Cristal to
the Kodak Theater. Imagine Jack
Nicholson making out with any-
one or Mickey Rourke thanking
his dogs for five minutes. Or better
yet, think of what might happen
to the angry director who doesn't
win! Gossip gold, I tell ya!
After everyone's sufficiently
sloshed, shorten the broadcast.
I'm pretty sure last year's broad-
castwas 17 hours. Atthat rate,
they'll be on PBS offering umbrel-
las next year.
And please, get some bet-
ter writers. One more crappy
bit of innuendo about not being
nominated, how everyone's "doing
tonight" or how the presenters'
The Academy
Awards really
just need
more alcohol.
new movies are coming out, and
we'll have to tar and feather Bruce
Vilanch's typewriter just to get
the point across. Hire the cast of
"SNL." Bring back Buck Henry. Or
just get previous screenplay writ-
ers to actually bring the goods.
The biggest problem with
this year's awards is "The Dark
Knight." The whole elitist notion-
of Oscar-bait films needsoto go.
Who actually liked "Benjamin But-
ton" or the "The Reader?" Their
well-financed marketing depart-
ments sure did. The brilliant "Dirk
Knight" wasn't so lucky.
Granted, indie crowd-pleasers
like "Slumdog Millionaire" and
"Milk" deserve their nominations,
even if few people have seen them.
But put one popular piece like
"Dark Knight" up each year, and
let people think it hasa chance
of winning. Same with films like
"Superbad" or "Gran Torino."
This can help the Oscar find an
audience again. It sure as hell
worked for "Titanic."
Granted, these are just a
couple of ideas. Anyway, I look
forward to Feb. 22. Maybe
"Slumdog" will sweep. Maybe
Mickey Rourke will fix his burnt
bridges. Maybe the Oscars will
suck like every year, but at least
they could be interesting.
Goble also thinks that
"Superbad" is an homage to "The
Godfather." Tell him why he's
wrong at bgoblue@umich.edu

' Ground control to Tel Aviv

By JEFF SANFORD
Daily Arts Writer
Telefon Tel Aviv's work has
always been cinematic. The group's
previous albums
sound as if they
were the sound-
tracks to some Telefon
visually stunning
art film - the Tel Aviv
scenes and over- Immolate
all plot play out Yourself
in your head and tyitch Control
are constantly
informed by the
dense electronic soundscapes com-
ing from the headphones. In this

respect, TTV's releases have been
perfect for pure mental transport,
sweeping mind from body and giv-
ing it wings. This, however, made
casual listening difficult and may
have turned off more than a few
wary listeners unwilling to part
with their brains.
With Immolate Yourself the New
Orleans duo (Charles Cooper and
Joshua Eustis) has focused less on
crafting complex sonic backdrops
and more on building songs that
stand by themselves. These songs
actually differentiate between
verse and chorus (in their loosest
definitions), and - here's the kick-
er - they distinguish themselves

markedly from each other.
Where, in the past, tracks blend-
ed into each other and fed off their
fellows to create one encompassing
mood, the songs here establish indi-
vidual personalities. Opener "The
Birds" recalls the old Telefon: ethe-
real swells float by innocently until a
pulsing bass drum propels the song
into an explosion of ambient bliss.
Like before, the beauty is in the sub-
tleties - the endlessly complex beat
tics, the finely chopped-and-pasted
vocals and all the little undefined
noises that come together beauti-
fully to shake up the senses.
But the pair doesn't ride that
train for long. "The Birds" evapo-
rates into the shrapnel beat of
"Your Mouth," a track dominated
by a razor-sharp organ synthesizer
and vaguely robotic vocals. Unlike.
"The Birds," it's hardly subtle, and
it's the first inclination that TTV
is really mixing it up this time
around, "Your Mouth" is just one of
the songs on Immolate Yourselfthat
focuses heavily on vocals, which is
a relatively groundbreaking move
for the group.
"Helen of Troy," probably TTV's
biggest leap of faith, wouldn't
sound out of place on an '80s New
Wave mix. Its straightforward
danceability is almost as surpris-
ing as the "oooh-ahh" hook in the
chorus. Still, it's a revitalizing
shock for the group and proves
that, in addition to its mastery of
atmosphere, the duo has a solid
grasp on pop structures.
Even though Immolate Your-
self demonstrates TTV's ability

to reshape its sound from track to
track, the collective sum of the
duo's skills still pales in comparison
to other well-established electroni-
ca acts like Aphex Twin and Boards
of Canada. The transition from the
trancey and 'emotional "Made a
Tree on the Wold" to the disjointed
"Your Every Idol" is rather bumpy
and unfulfilling. It's a reminder
that TTV hasn't finished rounding
off its sound just yet.
Through the sparkling interplay
between lead and rhythm guitar on
"You Are the Worst Thing in the

An album that ARTS IN BRIEF

works on its own

I? Stoles

and oint to TV Review
n Off-color comedy at its best
a rich future.

World" and the soaring optimism of
album finale "Immolate Yourself,"
it's easy to hear Telefon Tel Aviv
sharpening its tools for the future.
Immolate Yourself is the sound of
the first stages of a metamorpho-
sis - perhaps the cocoon-building
phase - providing a foundation
for greater changes to come. But
far from being simply a stepping
stone to something bigger, the
album stands remarkably tall on its
own. It's an album that delights in
the present and anticipates a very
promising future.

"The Whitest Kids U'Know" Season Three
Tuesdays at 10 p.m.
IFC
Where's the humor in bestiality, anti-Semitism and pedophilia? It's
in "The Whitest Kids U'Know," ashow which has been satisfying man's
desire for crude and unusual comedy since its debut on FUSE in 2007.
Two years later, "Whitest Kids" is in its third season and still supplying
laughs, though this time on a new network.
"Whitest Kids" is a comedy sketch show performed by five men who
push the limits of inappropriate humor. Past skits have involved every-
thing, including people doing drugs with raptors, a homophobic doctor
examining a man for testicular cancer and Adolf Hitler starting a rap
career. It may be distasteful, but it's awfully funny.
New episodes of "Whitest Kids" are now being shown uncensored
and commercial-free on the Independent Film Channel. It's not really
clear how the uncensored programming label will affect the content of
the third season. Previous seasons often included topless women for
the sole purpose of boosting uncensored DVD sales. So it's likely that
the troupe won't hesitate to take advantage of its new home.
The most significant change to "Whitest Kids" this time around
is its new format. The third season will consist of more episodes, but
each episode will have a running time of only 15 minutes. This brief
length could perform better with online audiences than with TV
viewers. The third season of "The Whitest Kids U'Know" will have
to keep producing excellent sketches to keep viewers interested in its
unusual take on humor.

"We share (Granholm's) con-

of our state and all the citizens of
our state," he said. "I can assure
you that financial aid will be a big
focus in our budget planning and
development."
The University has raised tuition
every year for the past nine years.
Increases have ranged from a 2.8
percent-increase in 2000 and 2004
to a12.3-percentincrease in 2005.
The University raised tuition

For the recycling program to be
changed, Weinert said in his state-
ment that the city must ensure that
there is a long-term market for the
plastic product, that it generates
enough volume to be economically
beneficial and that it can be stored
on-site at recycling facilities for a
given period of time.
Weinert added that there are
facilities that recycle No. 6 plas-
tic in Michigan, but that many of
them ship the plastic materials to
processing plants overseas.
Both Teall and Weinert agreed
that the city is hesitant to give
materials to facilities that ship
abroad because of the environ-
mental, health and safety and
the michigan daily

increase.
Hanlon saidsalthough the Uni-
versity has raised tuition in the
past, financial aid increases have
often outpaced tuition increases.
Increasing financial aid
resources and containing costs
will continue to be priorities for
the University, Hanlon said.
"One thing I can assure you is
that accessibility is going to be a
really high priority," he said.

with processing plastic in devel-
oping countries.
Despite this setback, Levine was
not discouraged about the pos-
sibility of his proposal and spoke
again at last night's City Council
meeting to discuss his ideas.
Levine said he plans on doing
more research to find places that
are closer to Ann Arbor that don't
send plastics overseas.
"I would like the city to work
with one of the facilities I find
after my research to recycle No. 6
plastic," he said.
In addition, Levine wants to
garner support from the Univer-
sity to further his proposal.
"The University and Ann Arbor
are so closely related," he said. "If
the University would get behind
this idea I think the city would
take a bigger look into this."

Michigan Difference campaign
ends at more than $3.2 billion

Total sets new record
among all public
universities in the
United States
By LINDY STEVENS
Daily StaffReporter
After almost five years of fund-
raising, the final tally from the
Michigan Difference campaign was
announced yesterday. Coming in at
over $3.2 billion, the effort was the
largest fundraiser in the history of
the University and set a new record
among all public universities in the
United States.
The previous record was held

by a 10-year, $3.06 billion cam-
paign at the University of Califor-
nia at Los Angeles that ended in
2006.
The Michigan Difference,
which was made public in 2004
and officially ended on Dec. 31
of last year, surpassed the initia-
tive's original $2.5 billion goal by
28 percent.
The $3.2 billion campaign raised
$519 million for student support,
including 1,969 scholarships total-
ing about $260 million. The effort
generated $10 million for students
in fiscal year 2008 and added more
than $910 million to the Univer-
sity's endowment.
The campaign also helped fund
185 new professorships and 22
building projects, including the

Ross School of Business building,
the Gerald R. Ford School of Public
Policy's Weill Hall, the C.S. Mott
Children's Hospital and Women's
Hospital, the Wilpon Baseball and
Softball Complex and the Museum
of Art expansion.
Since its outset, more than
365,000 donors have contributed
to the campaign, which was coordi-
nated by approximately 1,400 vol-
unteer organizers.
University President Mary Sue
Coleman thanked those individu-
als involved with the campaign
during an event unveiling the
drives previous tally of $3.1 billion
in November.
During her speech at the event,
Coleman emphasized the impor-
tance of contributing to the Univer-

sity, calling it "an investment unlike
any other."
"It is an enterprise that advances
worthy ideals, creates productive
jobs and opens the doors to pos-
sibilities for the student who walk
through them," Coleman said.
"Hail to you, for being the Michi-
gan Difference."
At other universities across the
country, similar campaigns are
underway, with $4-billion fund-
raising efforts at Cornell University
and Columbia University.
As of October, Cornell had
raised $2.3 billion and Columbia
had raised $2.9 billion, according
to the Chronicle of Higher Edu-
cation. Both schools are set to
end their fundraising campaigns
in 2011.

For Wednesday, Feb. 4, 2009
ARIES
(March 21 to April 19)
For some time now, you've been feel-
ing rebellious or unhappy at work. Today
these feelings might come to a head.
Something seems to be the last straw.
TAURUS
(April 20 to May 20)
Parents need to be patient with chil-
dren today. Creative projects might be
halted, delayed or entirely changed.
Vacations might be canceled. Yikes!
GEMINI
(May 21 to June 20)
Difficulties on the home front or with
family members are likely now. You feel
something has to change because it cant
go on the way it is. (You're probably
right.)
CANCER
(June 21 to July 22)
This is an accident-prone time for you
right now. Certain restraints are testing
your independence. The result is you
want to speak your mind!
LEO
(July 23 to Aug. 22)
Sudden upsets, surprises or reversals
with financial matters are coming to a
head now. You definitely have to decide
what to do. Someone will help you.
VIRGO
(Aug. 23 to Sept. 22)
Difficulties with partners and close
friends might be very clear today. Ask
yourself what your long-term objectives
are. (Why win the battle if it means
you'll lose the war?)
LIBRA
(Sept. 23 to Oct. 22)
You're prepared to assert yourself at
work today. You're no longer willing to
do something that you just don't want to
do. And that's OK, too.

SCORPIO
(0c. 231to Nov. 21)
Difficulties with friends or groups
could become very clear today. If you
don't want to be part of something any-
more, just leave.
SAGITTARIUS
(Nov. 22 to Dec. 21)
Relations with parents, bosses and
VIPs are challenging for you now. You
want to have the freedom to do your own
thing. (Freedom has always been a sur-
vival issue for you.)
CAPRICORN
(Dec. 22 to Jan. 19)
Be careful. Slow down. Think before
you speak or act. This is an accidetnt-
prone day for you, both verbally and
physically.
AQUARIUS
(Jan. 20to Feb. 18)
Stay on top of ytrtfiancial scene.
Keep track of your money. If shopping
today, keep your receipts. It's easy for
something to get out of hand.
PISCES
(Feh. IS to March 201
You wait more freedom in your rela-
tionship with partners. You feel your
independence is threatened or smoth-
ered. Because of this, you're prepared to
make a stand about something today.
YOU BORN TODAY You're individ-
ualistic, and you're a straight shooter
who is sincere about going after what
you want. You always defend the rights
of the underdog. You have many hobbies
because you like to be stimulated and
entertained. (No bores allowed!) Get
ready for probably one of the best years
of your life. You're very powerful in
2009!

Obama's pick for
health secretary
failed to pay over
$120,000 in taxes
WASHINGTON (AP) - Fight-
ing to salvage his Cabinet nomina-
tion, Tom Daschle apologized from
morning to night yesterday for
failing to pay more than $120,000
in federal taxes. President Barack
Obama said he was "absolutely"
sticking with his choice for health
secretary, and a key senator added
an important endorsement.
The White House both under-
scoredthemagnitudeofthe problem
and tried to downplay it in the space
of seven words. "Nobody's perfect,"
said press secretary Robert Gibbs.
"It was a serious mistake...."
RED HOT
FromPage1
"If you're going to put money
into something, you need the secu-
rity," Slade said.
Toward the end ofhis 30-year own-
ership of Red Hot Lovers, the previ-
ous owner had a series of year-to-year
lease extensions from Johnston, Slade
said. He added that the former restau-
rant owner worked with the short-
term commitment in part because he
was nearingretirement.
In January 2007, the property
next to Red Hot Lovers was pur-
chased by the developers of Zara-
gon Place, an apartment complex

wonderful advancements in medi-
cation and treatment that we're
able to welcome more and more
students into our institution that
have a higher level of concern in
the sense of development and well
being in the community."
LSA-SG President Leslie Zai-
kis, said questions like those were
the kind she wanted asked at the
town hall. She said although LSA-
SG is not currently working on an
autism or mental illness project,
she hopes to start one in response
to the subject being brought up at
the forum.

Nobody was predicting defeatfor
Daschle's nomination as secretary
of health and human services, but
it was proving an unsavory pill to
swallow for senators who only last
week confirmed Timothy Geithner
as treasury secretary despite his
separate tax-payment problems. It's
an issue that strikes a nerve among
lawmakers' constituents who are
struggling with their own serious
money problems.
On the bright side for Daschle,
he got warm words of support from
the chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, the panel that will have
the first say on his fate. Daschle has
been "an invaluable and expert
partner" in efforts toward health
care reform, said Democrat Max
Baucus of Montana - an especially
important endorsement since the
two men have had tussles in the
past over Baucus' handling of GOP
that is set to open in May. Formerly
the site of the Anberay apartments,
the Zaragon's property had an ask-
ing price of $5.45 million - roughly
$354 per square foot for the land,
according to the Ann Arbor Busi-
ness Review.
With a short-term lease, John-
ston's property could remain avail-
able for similar opportunities.
Slade, a 2003 University graduate,
lives in and operates the business
from New York, where he grew up.
He works for Eli Lilly and Company,
a pharmaceutical company.
Red Hot Lovers was Slade's
favorite restaurant in Ann Arbor
when he was a student, but he often
wished it was open later than 8 p.m.
After the meeting, MSA Presi-
dent Sabrina Shingwani, an LSA
senior, said she would have liked
a bigger turnout, though she said
an effort was made to tell students
about the forum.
"We put out the viewpoint,"
Shingwani said, referring to a let-
ter to the editor published in The
Michigan Daily yesterday. "We sent
out the e-mails, we had the Face-
book group and the turnout was
less than desired.
Despite the low turnout, Shin-
gwani said she liked the questions
that were asked.
"I wish there had been more
students to voice concerns," she
said.
Public Policy senior Jeremy

tax-cut proposals, Medicare chang-
es and other issues.
A number of other Democrats
on the committee also voiced their
support. John Kerry of Massachu-
setts said that "there is a completely
understandable, absolutely accept-
able and rational explanation for
what happened here."
Republicans weren't so quick to
get in line.
Going into a private meeting
between Daschle and committee
members late Monday, Iowa Sen.
Chuck Grassley, top Republican
on the Finance panel, was asked
if he supported the nomination.
He responded, "Ask me after the
hearing a week from tomorrow," a
reference to Daschle's public con-
firmation hearing.
After the meeting, which lasted
a little more than hour, Daschle
apologized anew.
When he was back in town for his
sister's graduation, he "hit it off"
with the former owner during a
conversation that ultimately led to
Slade's acquisition of the business.
Soon, Red Hot Lovers was open
until 4 a.m. six nights per week,
joining the likes of New York Pizza
Depot, Backroom Pizza and BTB
Burrito as late-night destinations.
Slade said he's committed to pre-
serving the tradition - and improv-
ing on it.
"Red Hot's is not going any-
where," he said. "I paid too much
money. I love the business. I love
the concept. I want to do something
with it. I have tremendous plans to
do more with the business."
Borovitz, who is not a member of a
student government but attended
the event, said the town hall was
a good idea. But since student gov-
ernment elections start in March,
he said there isn't enough time to
enact what was discussed at the
forum.
"In theory, it's a good idea. It's
unfortunate that it's happening
at the end of the term for most of
these members," Borovitz said.
"I can't even tell you how many
of my friends tell me MSA is use-
less. I don't think we have to be
entrenched in this system of dis-
content."
- Sagar Deshpande
contributed to this report.

"It was completely inadvertent,
but that's no excuse," he said. "I
apologize to President Obama, to
my colleagues and to the American
people."
Daschle, the former Senate
Democratic leader, expressed his
remorse earlier in a letter to the
Finance Committee, saying he was
"deeply embarrassed and disap-
pointed" about what he said was an
unintentional failure to pay taxes
that he owed. He recently filed
amended returns for 2005-07 to
report $128,203 in back taxes and
$11,964 in interest.
Obama, asked at the White
House whether he was standing by
his nomination, answered, "Abso-
lutely." He did not elaborate.
Vice President Joe Biden, a for-
mer longtime senator, was mak-
ing calls to Capitol Hill trying to
cement support.

"In this economic time it is
especially difficult for people to
reach into their pockets and help
out," she said.
About 800 people made per-
sonal donations for the event this
year, she said.
"It shows everyone's com-
mitment to the cause and to the
Michigan community," she said.
Part of the proceeds - about
$33,000 - will help revamp the
new cancer floor at the Children's
Hospital. Another portion of the
donations will be given to the
Residential College-sponsored
"Telling It" program, which uses
the arts to promote literacy for
children in high-risk situations
in Washtenaw County.
Former University athletes
will also judge the competition.
The celebrity judges include
former University athletes
Peter Vanderkaay, an Olym-
pic gold medalist swimmer,
and former NBA player Jimmy
King, as well as two-time
field hockey Olympian Marcia
Pankratz, a former University
coach.
The show starts at 7:30 p.m.
Tickets are available at the door,
and doors open at 7 p.m. General
admission tickets are $10 and
premier seating is $15.

No need to panic, Blue s 21-game drought
future still looks promising ends for Czarnik
By CHRIS MESZAROS his best hockey, and Czarnik is de

efi-

After his team blew a
20-point lead to the
Chicago Bears in 2006,
former Arizona Cardinals coach
Dennis Green erupted during his
postgame press conference. His
tantrum was featured on every
major sports media outlet and was
later spoofed ina Coors Light com-
mercial.
Among Green's ALEX
famous words was PROSPERI
this gem, refer-
ring to the Bears: On Men's
"They are who we Basketball
thought they were."
More than two years later, those
words summarize the Michigan
men's basketball team's season.
After a 9-2 non-conference
schedule catapulted the Wolver-
ines into both Top 25 polls by the
end of December, Michigan quickly
became a Cinderella story. At the
time, few doubted the Wolverines
would make the NCAA Tourna-
ment for the first time since 1998.
Expectations rose so high that if
Michigan (4-6 Big Ten, 14-8 over-
all) didn't make the tournament, it
seemed that the season would be a
bust. But those expectations were
simply too high for this team.
"We'll have ups," Beilein said on
Oct. 14. "More ups than last year,
we hope. We'll have downs; that's a
constant."
Michigan has an outside chance
of dancing in March, but here are
three reasons why the Wolver-
ines faithful should stay positive
through the rest of the season.
The man in charge: Michigan
fans had it rough recently. In
former Michigan coach Tommy
Amaker's second year (2002-03),
the team won six more games
than the year before and won the
National Invitation Tournament
the next season. But in six seasons,
Amaker never made it over the
jump to the NCAA Tournament.

So when Michigan toppled UCLA
and Duke this season, some fans
were a bit skeptical about getting
too excited. After seeing the Wol-
verines lose five of their last six
conference games this season, they
were right.
But Beilein and Amaker aren't
the same coach.
Before coming to Ann Arbor,
Amaker coached four years at
Seton Hall and had a 68-55 record.
He was young, just 35, and seemed
to have a bright future. But six
years without dancing says other-
wise. Beilein, on the other hand,
has experience.
Michigan was just 10-22 last
season. But in Beilein's first three
seasons at West Virginia, the win
total increased each year, so there's
room for optimism.
When it comes to strategy, the
comparison isn't even close. Amak-
er rarely called an inbounds play
and often ran down the shot clock
just to have a desperation 3-pointer
clank off the rim. He developed
the reputation as a poor in-game
coach.
Beilein is highly respected
among his college basketball col-
leagues. ESPN's Dick Vitale wrote
in 2005, "Many college basketball
insiders feel that Beilein is one of
the masters on the sidelines."
Don't worry. Beilein's got it
under control.
The players: If you haven't
noticed yet, Michigan isn't that
talented right now. The Wolverines
feature two of the conference's
premier scorers and rebounders in
sophomore guard Manny Harris
and junior forward DeShawn Sims.
After that, there's a dropoff in
talent.
Sophomore point guard Kelvin
Grady has shown great improve-
ment this season, but there are
arguably eight point guards in the
Big Ten better than him.

The last time freshman Rob-
bie Czarnik scored a goal, Barack
Obama hadn't yet been elected
President.
And not only was snapping his
21-game goalless streak Saturday
against then-No. 1
Notre Dame cause NOTEBOOK
for celebration,
but his goal also couldn't have come
at a better time.
The score brought the Wolverines
within one after falling behind 3-0.
And it may have been exactly
what the freshman needed after
three months of frustrating games.
Coming into the season, Michi-
gan coach Red Berenson knew
Czarnik had the talent to play. It was
simply a matter of if that skill would
transfer to the ice.
"He's worked hard, he's played
well," Berenson said. "I'm not sur-
prised that he scored, but Ican't pre-
dict if it's going to change his game
or if it's going to elevate his produc-
tion or his line's production."
Czarnik scored his third-period
goal on a blueline pass from sopho-
more forward Aaron Palushaj, who
ended his own eight-game goal
drought Saturday.
"It felt greatto finally put one in,"
Czarnik said. "I wasn't too worried
aboutscoring, I knew it'd eventually
come."
Czarnik is part of the team's third
line that is finally starting to click.
The freshman plays with senior Tim
Miller, who scored Friday's game-
winning goal, and junior Brian Leb-
ler, who had an assist on Saturday.
Czarnik's linemates have played
well recently, particularly Miller,
who has excelled on the penalty kill.
With the rest of the line playing well,
it was just a matter of time before
Czarnik finally got on the board.
"That line has something going
for it right now," Berenson said.
"Miller's been playing his best hock-
ey, and I think Lebler's been playing

nitely playing well."
WORTHY OF NO. 1: It's rare
that a college hockey goal makes
ESPN's Top 10 Plays, let alone be
No. 1. But Friday, Miller's faceoff
goal in the second period earned
the top spot.
Miller took the draw but didn't
win it cleanly. He then reached
his stick behind his opponent's leg
and fired a quick wrist shot past
surprised Notre Dame goaltender
Jordan Pearce. The goal extended
Michigan's lead to 2-0.
"I was going to go forward with
the puck until Czarnik drove the
net," Miller said. "Then they left
a (defenseman) in the middle, so I
changed it up and tried to go back.
Their guy fell on the ice, and I just
got it out of his skates and shot it as
quick as I could."
BACK TO PRACTICE: Senior
captain Mark Mitera completed his
return to practice yesterday. Mitera
was seen last week skating with the
team before practices, but yester-
day was his first full practice since
his knee injury against St. Law-
rence the first week of the regular
season.
"He's behind," Berenson said.
"He hasn't played a game since early
October. He's going to skate hard
and we put him on forward to get
him skating more.and handling the
puck more."o
Though the senior is far from
game shape, both he and Berenson
noted that his recovery from knee
surgery is going faster than expect-
ed.
Mitera has stated he would like
to return to the ice before the end of
the regular season, four weeks from
now.
"Personally, I think I should be
able to play (by the end of the sea-
son)," Mitera said three weeks ago.
"I need to make sure everything
heals properly. I don't want to take
any risks at this point, but that's my
goal, to get back for one more game
at Yost."

Freshman Zack Novak should be one of Michigan's top performers in future seasons.

And don't forget the fact that
three freshmen have had to play
significant minutes. Those three,
guards Laval Lucas-Perry, Zack
Novak and Stu Douglass, have
had their moments and will all be
important parts to the program.
But for now they're young and
inexperienced.
With that said, Michigan still
has 14 wins with nine games left in
a better-than-advertised Big Ten
that has four teams in the AP Top
25. Smile.
Thefuture: Beilein can recruit.

In just his second season at Michi-
gan, he has commitments from a
trio of three-star recruits and one
four-star.
He's not known for bringing in
big-time recruits and instead, typi-
cally molds certain players to fit his
system. But after bringing two top-
20 players at their respective posi-
tions, expect Michigan's level of
talent to rise in the years to come.
The NCAA Tournament may not
be in Michigan's future this year,
but don't panic. There are plenty of
good times to come.


Redshirt freshman could be
Blue's 'secret weapon' on rings

Vance coming out
strong after spraining
ankle last year
By COLT ROSENSWEIG
Daily Sports Writer
Few in the University of Illinois-
Chicago P.E. Building took notice as
a small Wolverine stepped up to the
rings halfway through the Windy
City Invitational on Jan. 17. The
Michigan men's gymnastics team
and its fans, however, were riveted.
For his first time in college, redshirt
freshman Andrew Vance was about

to compete.
For rings, the fourth event, all
the non-competing Wolverines left
the bleachers to cluster by the rings
tower. Second in the lineup, his face
devoid of emotion, Vance grabbed
the rings and smoothly executed his
routine, just like in practice.
After he landed his double-layout
dismount with a small hop, emo-
tion poured out. Vance yelled and
clapped with triumph, even in the
middle of his final salute to the
judges.
"It was probably the best overall
feeling I've had in my gymnastics
career so far," Vance said. "It was
just an indescribable feeling of sat-


isfaction and accomplishment."
Vance arrived at Michigan as
a walk-on last year, and when he
sprained his ankle in the winter, he
knew he couldn't compete until his
second season. So last summer, he
attacked rings, his favorite event,
with renewed vigor:
It helped that Michigan assistant
coach Scott Vetere implemented a
tough strength program to improve
the ring men's holds and positions.
One morning, he put the gymnasts
through eight sequences in which
they had to hold each position for
six seconds. In competition, a gym-
nast must hold his position for just
two seconds to get credit for the
skill.
"I felt like a was going to die,"
senior co-captain Phil Goldberg
said. "It really helped (Vance) a
lot because he just has a ring-man
body."
Vance, who's about five feet tall,
has a comparatively large and pow-
erful upper body. His teammates
almost immediately nicknamed
him "Midge" upon his arrival, but
Vance didn't take any offense. At
his old gym, Michigan Academy in
Westland, he was known as "Frog"
because as a little boy, his favorite
shirt had a picture of a frog on it.
"I'm kind of stuck in a position
here where everyone calls him
'Midge,' and I called him 'Frog,' "
said former Michigan gymnast Dan
Rais,Vance'sroommate. "Nowl just
call him Andrew, his real name."
Vance's ticket into the lineup was
a quality vault to go with his power-
ful rings set. Even competing at the"
junior level, where everyone has to
compete in the all-around, Vance
had always focused on rings.
"He knows if he's just going to do
rings, it's going to be hard for him
to compete," Rais said. "I think he's
found a new love for (vault). Being
on the team, it's a lot more fun than
just being on a junior team that's
centered around yourself."
Goldberg, one of the team's top
ring men, is impressed with Vance's
improvement. He said he thinks the
Plytnouth native may be a secret
weapon for Michigan.
"I'm not sure other teams have
even heard about him, but he's defi-
nitely an All-American in waiting,"
Goldberg said. "He definitely has
the ability to do big things in college
gymnastics."

Sugiyama's leadership is similar
to Kuehn's. She has become one
of the best leaders on this year's
edition of the Wolverines, even
though she rarely talks while play-
ing.
Now, Sugiyama is Bernstein's
go-to player. The senior is just 10
wins away from becoming the
all-time wins leader in Wolverine
history. And with more than two
months left in the season, Sugi-
yama is on pace to reach the mile-
stone.
If she hopes to make a dive into
the NCAA Tournament this year,
the Japanese-born Sugiyama will
need to use every aspect of her

She made an early exit last year,
losing in the second round of the
NCAA Singles Championship.
But after much improvement and
another year of experience, Sugi-
yama is now looking to make a
statement.
"Chisako has been at the top of
our lineup since I've been here,"
Bernstein said. "She is definitely
one of those 'lead by example'
players."
