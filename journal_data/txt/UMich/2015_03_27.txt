CELEBRATING OUR ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FIFTH YEAR OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

 LSA juniors Jason 
Collela and Reid 
Klootwyk win 
executive seats

By CARLY NOAH

Daily Staff Reporter

Following an uncontested elec-

tion, LSA juniors Jason Colella and 
Reid Klootwyk were elected the next 
president and vice president of LSA 
student government, respectively.

Eight of the 10 vacant spots for 

LSA representatives were also filled 
in uncontested elections. The two 
remaining positions will be filled 
by write-in candidates, who had not 
been announced at press time.

At a candidate forum on Monday 

in the Michigan Union, the candi-
dates stressed student engagement, 
as well as the implementation of 
an international student mentor-
ship program and a project to allow 
transfer students to defer their 
enrollment like admitted freshmen 
currently can.

At the event, Colella and Kloot-

wyk both emphasized the impor-
tance of interacting with students.

Klootwyk works as the vice chair 

for the LSA SG Communications 
Committee. He has served on LSA 
SG for one year since transferring 
from a community college.

Colella, an East Quad resident 

advisor, also serves as chair for the 
LSA SG Budget Allocation Commit-
tee. He has served on LSA SG for 
three years.

In an interview, Colella said he 

and his running mate are hoping to 
change students’ opinions on the 
role of LSA SG.

“People are really cynical about 

student government,” he said. “It’s 
not because we don’t do anything, 
which is what a lot of people would 
say. It’s because people don’t realize 
all of the things that we have done 
to help improve the LSA experience. 
It’s a matter of working to let people 
know what we’re doing.”

Colella added that involving inter-

national students in campus affairs 
will help increase on-campus diver-
sity.

“International students is a big 

project we’ve been working on for 
the past year in student government; 
we’re creating this big internation-
al student mentorship program,” 
Colella said. “We’ve been meeting 
with administrators and trying to 
figure out what our vision is to better 

STUDENT GOVERNMENT

Commission likely 

won’t announce 
winners until 
Friday night

By LEA GIOTTO and 

TANAZ AHMED

Daily Staff Reporters

The results of this week’s Cen-

tral Student Government elec-
tions remained undecided early 

Friday morning. Voting closed 
online at midnight Friday.

According to the CSG Com-

piled Code, unofficial results 
are to be released to candidates 
24 hours after polls close. Offi-
cial results are to be released on 
the CSG website within 24 of 
confirmation by the University 
Elections Commission and after 
all pending litigation concludes. 
Election complaints can be deliv-
ered to the election director up 
until 24 hours after the polls 
close.

The UEC convened Wednes-

day and Thursday for hearings 
after Make Michigan filed a 
complaint against The Team for 
destruction of campaign materi-
als.

Make Michigan claimed that 

representatives 
or 
volunteers 

from The Team threw buckets of 
water on advertisements written 
in chalk that read “Vote for Make 
Michigan,” 
and 
subsequently 

replaced them with chalk adver-
tisements that read “The Team.”

Make Michigan members and 

volunteers said they had drawn 
these promotions near the block 
‘M’ on the Diag the night of 
March 16. The destruction alleg-
edly occurred the night of March 
18.

“It’s under (UEC) code that 

they are responsible for educat-
ing all of their members and can-
didates and ensuring they follow 
the rules that are prescribed for 
the election,” said Law School 
student 
Rachel 
Jankowski, 

counsel for Make Michigan. 

EVENT PREVIEW

MUSKET 

performs ‘Into 
the Woods’ like 

never before

Talented cast of 

student performers 
brings a fresh spin to 

modern classic

By ALEX BERNARD

Daily Community Culture Editor

Adam Quinn was excited. He 

couldn’t get the words out fast 
enough.

“I can guarantee that in seven 

months of research, there is some-
thing we are doing with this show 
that we have revealed to no one, 
that no production of Into the 
Woods has done before. And I can 
guarantee that.”

That’s what director Adam 

Quinn told me in a Starbucks on 
the corner of State St. and Lib-
erty St., where dozens of students 
tapped away at their laptops. It 
was easy to imagine what they 
were typing about: an economics 
paper, a sociology thesis, a tweet 
about how the barista got their 
name wrong on the cup – “It’s 
Alex, not ‘All Hecks!’” It was easy 
to imagine. It always is.

After 
all, 
it’s 
an 
ancient, 

respected 
practice 
– 
people-

watching. Observing that old man 
walk his Dachshund to impress 
the pretty woman on the bench 

and guessing that the wiener dog 
isn’t company enough anymore. 
Seeing that child trip over a tree 
root and distantly wondering if 
she’ll fall in the shower when she’s 
82, and will she break her hip? 
And who will help her?

It’s old. Old practice. Old stories.
“Into the Woods” – a musical 

about old tales – has become just 
that: Old. Fascinating, thought-
provoking and important, but 
familiar. Like a Lifetime Achieve-
ment Award or Robert De Niro. Or 
gravity.

And yet, MUSKET – Michigan’s 

only student-run musical theater 
group – promises a divergence, an 
unprecedented approach to one of 
our most celebrated, most widely 
performed musicals.

With music by the incompara-

ble Stephen Sondheim and a book 
by James Lapine, Into the Woods 
debuted on Broadway in 1987 
to critical acclaim and 10 Tony 
nominations. Last December, the 
Disney adaptation starring Meryl 
Streep, Anna Kendrick and Emily 
Blunt, among others, opened in 
theaters, capturing three Oscar 
nominations and a handful of 
other accolades.

The musical follows some of our 

favorite fairytale characters – Lit-
tle Red Riding Hood, Cinderella, 
Rapunzel, Jack and his Beanstalk 

Kazuo Ishiguro 
speaks as part 
of Helen Zell 
Writer’s Series

By TANYA MADHANI

Daily Staff Reporter

Students and Ann Arbor 

residents packed the Apse 
Room in the University’s 
Museum of Art on Thursday, 
awaiting the entrance of Brit-
ish author Kazuo Ishiguro.

Ishiguro was invited to 

participate in a University 
reading as part of the Helen 
Zell Visiting Writers Series, 
which has hosted writers 
such as fiction writer Sergio 
Troncoso and graphic novel-
ist Alison Bechdel.

Ishiguro read for 40 min-

utes from an excerpt of his 

most recent work, “The Bur-
ied Giant,” a fantasy-histor-
ical fiction novel set during 
the Anglo-Saxon settlement 
of Britain, and fielded ques-
tions from the audience.

When asked to name 

authors and works that have 
been most influential to him, 
Ishiguro 
noted 
Charlotte 

Brontë and Marcel Proust. 
Brontë’s narration style in 
particular, Ishiguro said, has 
influenced his own writing to 
the point when he mimicked 
a scene from her novel, “Jane 
Eyre,” in one of his works.

“I do love (her) and I 

hadn’t realized how much 
she had influenced me in my 
writing,” Ishiguro said. “I 
read ‘Jane Eyre’ a few years 
ago and there are all these 
things I’ve ripped off from it. 
There’s a particular way her 
narrator appears to con-

fide in the reader.”

Ann Arbor resident Karen 

Park said she attended the 
event after reading Ishigu-
ro’s novel, “Remains of the 
Day,” and said, while she 
loved the setting, she wished 
there was more opportunity 
for questions from the audi-
ence rather than a lengthy 
reading of his novel.

“It was still great to have 

him be here and be able to 
talk to us,” Park said. “I had 
a hard time getting into (the 
chapter) as he was reading it. 
I heard that sometimes it’s 
not best, like when you do 
a book on tape, to have the 
actual author reading the 
book. Perhaps that’s the case 
in this case, that it’d be better 
read than spoken out loud by 
the author.”

Park said, however, she 

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL

#UMICHVOTES

Michigan tops 

Missouri at Crisler 

Center, 65-55

By KELLY HALL

Daily Sports Writer

The Michigan women’s basketball 

team always records hype videos for the 
fans, but Thursday, it didn’t need them.

Wolverines coach Kim Barnes Arico 

said the home-court advantage at 
Crisler Center would make the differ-
ence, and it did. The fans exploded after 
foul calls on Michigan and became 
louder with every bucket that expanded 
its game-defining lead late in the second 
half.

“The energy is huge in a basketball 

game, especially when you’re trying to 
withstand a run that the other team is 
making, or when we’re trying to run 
and put it away,” said senior forward 
Nicole Elmblad. “To have the crowd we 
had tonight was special.”

After a rough start, the Wolverines 

(8-10 Big Ten, 19-14 overall) beat Mis-
souri 65-55 with a well balanced offense 
that included five players scoring in 
double digits, led by senior guard Shan-
non Smith, who recorded 13 points.

“A lot of times, we’ve got a couple 

people that are leading us in scoring,” 
Elmblad said. “When we’re able to dis-
tribute that scoring and we’re able to 
get everyone on the court as a threat, it 
makes teams struggle to guard you.”

Added Barnes Arico: “Nicole Elm-

blad knocked down some shots for us,

“Lyric Revolution” 
effort stems from 
entrepreneurship 

class project

By LINDSEY SCULLEN

Daily Staff Reporter

Prompted by a shared distaste 

for current popular music, a 
group of students is using a class 
project to start a “Lyric Revolu-
tion.”

Music, Theatre & Dance soph-

omore Hannah Baiardi, a co-
founder of “Lyric Revolution”, 
said she often finds the majority 
of popular music today is both 
“derogatory” and “offensive.”

“I find it, personally, really 

discouraging,” Baiardi said. “A 
lot of times it’s not sophisticated. 
It can tend to be shallow, repeti-
tive and not really very deep. As 
a musician, I find that really irk-
some.”

To 
combat 
that 
problem, 

Baiardi and a group of class-
mates from the class, “Entrepre-
neurial Creativity”, have built 
and launched a website titled 
“Lyric Revolution.” The site fea-
tures local artists and forums 
for viewers to engage with other 
musicians and music lovers.

The website was first con-

ceived in the class, which is 
taught by Education Lecturer 
Eric Fretz and is one of the 
core classes for the University‘s 
entrepreneurship minor. At the 
beginning of the class, Fretz has 
his students create a PowerPoint 
slide about themselves, their 
passions and projects they are 
interested in. It was that process 
that brought the group together 
and allowed them to realize 
their common passions.

“We all kind of came together 

on this idea that meaningful lyr-
ics and positive changes through 
music can be really powerful,” 
said LSA sophomore Jacqueline 
Shandler, a co-founder of Lyric 

Revolution. “I can see it going 
well beyond this class because 
we’re all passionate about it. 
We’re all driven. We want to see 
it go somewhere.”

Currently in its second week, 

the website is built around a 
“featured artists” page, which 
spotlights local artists and their 
original compositions posted on 
SoundCloud.

The founders said the fea-

tured artists are meant to repre-
sent a clear distinction from the 
sounds of today’s Top 40 hits.

“People can’t really control 

which music, what they’re going 
to hear,” Shandler said. “You 
could be going anywhere and 
hear music that isn’t appropri-
ate.”

It’s that lack of control that 

drives the group toward attempt-
ing a “revolution,” a transforma-
tion in the way today’s music is 
written.

Another part of the initiative 

is found in the “our parodies” tab 
on the website. Currently, a par-
ody of Robin Thicke’s “Blurred 
Lines” is displayed. In place of 
the opening line of Thicke’s cho-
rus, “And that’s why I’m gon’ 
take a good girl. I know you want 
it,” are the following lines: “And 
that’s why I stand for justice. You 
know I’ve earned it.”

A third tab on the website asks 

users to “join the conversation,” 
and provides space for users to 
post comments.

One post made by the found-

ers is titled “Be the Change.” It 
poses two scenarios; the first one 
describes a situation in which 
Pitbull’s “Time of Our Lives” 
comes on the radio while a bab-
ysitter is driving a child to an 
activity. The second scenario is 
the same, but in place of Pitbull, 
the radio plays a song that’s both 
catchy and helps raise awareness 
about social issues.

“It’s simply a platform for con-

versation, to kind of pick people’s 
brains about, you know, how 
do you feel about lyrics? What 
can we do to change that? Can

19 injured in New York fire, 
building gas blast blamed

Smoke spread for 
miles after the 

Manhattan structure 

collapsed

NEW 
YORK 
(AP) 
— 
An 

apparent gas explosion leveled 
an apartment building, largely 
destroyed another and launched 
rubble 
and 
shards 
of 
glass 

across streets in the heart of 
Manhattan’s trendy East Village 
on Thursday, injuring 19 people. 
Smoke could be seen and smelled 
for miles.

Restaurant diners ran out 

of their shoes and bystanders 
helped one another to escape 
the midafternoon blast, which 
damaged four buildings as flames 
shot into the air, witnesses said. 
Passers-by were hit by debris 
and flying glass, and bloodied 
victims were aided as they sat on 
sidewalks and lay on the ground, 
they said.

“It was terrifying — absolutely 

terrifying,” said Bruce Finley, a 
visitor from San Antonio, Texas, 
who had just taken a photo of 

his food at a restaurant known 
for its French fries when he felt 
the explosion next door. “It just 
happened out of the blue. ... We 
were shaking even an hour, hour 
and a half later.”

Mayor Bill de Blasio said 

preliminary evidence suggested a 
gas explosion amid plumbing and 
gas work inside the building that 
collapsed was to blame.

A plumber was doing work 

connected 
to 
a 
gas 
service 

upgrade, and inspectors from 
utility Con Edison had been there 
to check on a planned meter 
installation an hour before the 
fire, company President Craig 
Ivey said. But the work failed the 
inspection, partly because a space 
for the new meters wasn’t big 
enough, and the inspectors said 
gas couldn’t be introduced to that 
part of the building, Con Ed said.

The state Department of Public 

Service was monitoring Con Ed’s 
response.

The fire happened a little over 

a year after a gas explosion in a 
building in East Harlem killed 
eight people and injured about 
50. A National Transportation 

Safety Board report released last 
week said a leak reported just 
before the deadly blast may have 
come from a 3-year-old section 
of plastic pipe rather than a 
127-year-old cast-iron segment 
that came under scrutiny in the 
immediate aftermath.

De Blasio noted no one had 

reported 
a 
gas 
leak 
before 

Thursday’s blast. Con Edison said 
it had surveyed the gas mains on 
the block Wednesday and found 
no leaks.

Bystander Blake Farber, who 

lives around the corner, said he’d 
been walking by the building and 
smelled gas seconds before the big 
blast.

Firefighters continued pouring 

water 
on 
the 
buildings 
for 

hours after the explosion, in an 
area of old tenement buildings 
that are home to students and 
longtime residents near New 
York University and Washington 
Square Park.

Firefighters said at least 19 

people were hurt, four critically, 
some with burns to their airways. 
De Blasio said it didn’t appear that 
anyone was missing.

“That 
includes 
not 
causing 

major infractions like this one: 
destructing an opposing party’s 
campaign materials.”

Destruction 
of 
campaign 

materials is a violation of cam-
paign conduct as outlined by the 
UEC Election Code, which is 
part of the CSG Compiled Code. 
The code declares that, if violat-
ed, individuals or parties receive 
demerits — one or two demerits 
are given for minor infractions 
and three or four are given for 
major infractions. Destruction 
of campaign material is a major 
infraction. Individual candidates 
are disqualified if they receive 
five or more demerits, and entire 
parties are disqualified if they 
receive 10 or more.

Regardless 
of 
whether 
a 

member of The Team or a non-
candidate was responsible for 
the destruction, Make Michigan 
asked the Central Student Judi-
ciary to give The Team three or 
four demerits.

“We believe beyond a reason-

able doubt that The Team was 
responsible for this,” Jankowski 
said. “No one else would have 
the intent or the want and mal-
ice to do these kind of actions. 
There’s no reason anyone would 
come out and pour water onto 
sidewalk chalk unless it was 
an opposing party intending to 
destruct campaign materials and 
replacing them with their own.”

However, 
some 
members 

of the commission questioned 
that assertion and suggested 
other groups could have been 
responsible, including the third 
party running in CSG elections, 
the Defend Affirmative Action 
Party.

“Wouldn’t it make even more 

sense for a member of DAAP to 
remove Make Michigan’s cam-
paign materials and put some-
thing that makes it look like The 
Team might have done it over 
it?” asked Law School student 
Paige Becker, chair of the UEC.

Jankowski said in response 

that DAAP could have commit-
ted the violation, but the fact 
that The Team’s advertisements 
replaced Make Michigan’s does 
not make DAAP look guilty.

Law School student Sarah 

Brenner, legal counsel for The 
Team, said Make Michigan’s 
complaint fails to prove beyond 
a reasonable doubt that a candi-
date or volunteer of The Team 
committed the destruction.

“As we all know, this destruc-

tion occurred on the Diag,” she 
said. ”The original Make Michi-
gan chalking occurred on March 
16th, and the pictures (of the 
new “The Team” chalking) were 
taken on March 18th. That’s two 
days in between. Within two 
days, thousands of people walk 
across the Diag, any one of which 
could have destroyed Make 
Michigan’s chalking.”

For a party to be found guilty, 

the person who committed the 
act, along with the act itself, 
need to fall under CSG’s “scope 
of coordination.”

Brenner said to fall under 

that scope the person who com-
mitted the act must have been 
“a candidate or a non-candi-
date who worked with or at the 
request of the party.” An act that 
falls within the scope of coordi-
nation must be “what the can-
didate or party requested the 
non-candidate to do.”

“So if the person did not do 

what the party requested them 
to do, they would not fall under 
the 
scope 
of 
coordination,” 

Brenner added.

Overall, Brenner argued that 

there is not enough evidence for 
The Team, or anyone represent-
ing The Team, to be found guilty.

The commission also brought 

up an additional element in 
the case — the fact that Make 
Michigan’s chalk drawing was 
only partially eradicated. The 
chalking originally said, “Vote 
for Make Michigan.” After the 
destruction, while “Make Mich-
igan” had been removed , the 
“Vote for” portion remained.

“Can you think of any rea-

son why someone who is clearly 
pouring water to destroy Make 
Michigan’s chalking, why they 
wouldn’t also pour water on the 
words, ‘Vote for’?” Law school 
student Brian Koziara, member 
of the UEC, asked.

Brenner said she did not find 

this question incriminating to 
The Team.

“I mean I can think of plenty 

of reasons,” she said. “If some-
one is trying to get two parties in 
here, the two biggest parties on 
campus that are fighting for this 
election, I can see somebody put-
ting water on one place and then 
creating an issue. I mean, abso-
lutely anyone on campus can do 
that.”

The UEC also considered two 

other lawsuits Wednesday.

Multiple 
candidates 
were 

accused of missing the manda-
tory candidates’ meeting at the 
beginning of the campaign sea-
son. According to Becker, candi-
dates who were thought to have 
had legitimate reasons for miss-
ing the meeting such as time 
conflicts with classes were given 
warnings.

Candidates who did not have 

a legitimate reason were each 
given a demerit.

A lawsuit between two Uni-

versity Law students was dis-
cussed as well. One student 
alleged there was an e-mail vio-
lation where the candidate used 
a listserv which did not belong to 
the student.

An additional lawsuit was 

filed Thursday by Make Michi-
gan against The Team. Make 
Michigan claims The Team 
committed a campaign funding 
violation by not reporting all of 
the party’s campaign expendi-
tures. The date and time for the 
hearing of this lawsuit has not 
yet been decided.

Another lawsuit on e-mail 

violations was also filed Thurs-
day by Make Michigan against a 
candidate for The Team running 
for the Art & Design representa-
tive position. UEC will hear the 
lawsuit on Friday.

the experience of students in LSA.”

Klootwyk said his experience 

as a non-traditional student has 
helped him understand the needs 
of transfer students better.

“Freshman students are allowed 

to enroll in the University and take a 
gap year,” Klootwyk said. “Transfer 
students can’t do that. A gap year is 
something that enhances their out-
look on life and education as well as 
they come back to campus.”

Colella added that the most 

important part of their election 
platform is connecting with LSA 
students.

“The biggest improvement is 

to better represent the students,” 
he said. “To really hear from all 
18,000 students as best we can.”

LSA senior Natasha Dabrowski, 

the current LSA SG president, said 
she was excited to see what Colella 
and Klootwyk would do in their 
positions and added that both are 
“knowledgeable, 
qualified 
and 

compassionate individuals.”

“Jason has served on too many 

LSA SG and administrative com-
mittees to name, and Reid is a fast 
learner who already, as a transfer 
student, has shown his leadership 
potential within LSA SG,” Dab-
rowski said. “I have no doubts that 
this team will continue to grow as 
leaders within LSA SG and serve as 
diligent advocates for all LSA stu-
dents.”

Dabrowski said she has appreci-

ated her experience serving as LSA 
SG president.

“I have felt a responsibility, 

having served on LSA SG for four 
years, to continue my commitment 
to LSA students and the University 
and to push myself in everything 
that I do as president,” she said.

Along with president and vice 

president, 10 students were elected 
LSA SG representatives.

LSA sophomore Aishawarya 

Singh said she decided to run for 
reelection because she thinks the 
work of LSA SG will not only bet-
ter the college experience of cur-
rent students, but also future ones. 
Singh said she has worked with 
the Residence Hall Association to 
improve toilet paper quality in the 

dorms. She also said she plans to 
create projects that would improve 
student access to Counseling 
and Psychological Services and 
the University Health Service.

LSA freshman Anna Giacomini 

said she chose to run for a position 
because she noticed her friends 
complaining about issues with the 
campus, but they showed little 
intention of attempting to improve 
them.

“The points on my platform 

include putting more lighting near 
the CCRB as well as the streets by 
the IM building, bettering SafeR-
ide by advertising through social 
media and hiring more drivers, and 
creating an app specifically for Uni-
versity of Michigan students that 
can contact the police and inform 
them of the individual’s location on 
campus,” GIacomini said. “When 
students feel safe, they are more 
likely to thrive and accomplish 
their goals.”

LSA 
sophomore 
Charlotte 

Shreve said the encouragement of 
fellow student government mem-
bers influenced her decision to run 
for LSA representative.

“This year I hope to take on 

more projects individually, espe-
cially some ideas I’ve been thinking 
up that are in the very early stages,” 
she said. “In addition, last semester 
I had the privilege of working with 
our Diversity Affairs Committee 
more than I had in previous semes-
ters, and I am really looking for-
ward to continuing my work with 
them and growing that committee 
and their outreach.”

LSA freshman Alexandra Contis 

said she was inspired to run for LSA 
representative because of her expe-
rience living on North Campus.

“I think often times we treat 

North Campus as another satellite 
location far away when, in reality, 
it is one university,” Contis said. “I 
am also interested in more … light-
ing, especially on North Campus by 
Northwood and the NCRB because 
safety and student well-being is my 
main concern, and should be the 
University’s as well.”

The other LSA representatives 

are LSA freshman John Petrie, 
LSA junior Zelin Wang, LSA senior 
Yong-Joon Kim and LSA freshman 
Briana Karcho.

would still give the book a 
chance.

“I think I’ll borrow it from the 

library first,” she said.

LSA senior Jenny Zhang said 

she attended because of her love 
for Ishiguro’s books and her own 
desire to write in the future.

Unlike Park, Zhang said, 

while she hadn’t read the book, 
she was interested in reading 
more of it in the future.

“As he was reading it, I kind 

of started imagining it in my 
head,” Zhang said. “So it was 
pretty vivid and evocative in 
letting the audience or who-
ever was listening imagine 
these scenes unfolding in their 
heads.”

Shannon Smith played sensational 
in the second half. (She’s a) differ-
ence maker, and (senior forward 
Cyesha Goree) just had a great 
game overall.”

In the first round of the tour-

nament, the Michigan favored 
an unconventional offense that 
included starting freshman for-
ward Emoni Jackson for the first 
time.

But against the Tigers (19-14), 

the Wolverines chose to go with a 
battle-tested lineup featuring their 
four regular starters and sopho-
more guard Danielle Williams, 
which — at least at first — didn’t 
work.

When Missouri jumped out to a 

12-3 lead, instead of implementing 
a stronger defense, Barnes Arico 
decided to focus on offense, leaving 
junior guard Madison Ristovski, 
freshman guard Katelynn Flaherty 
and Smith, a senior guard, all out 
on the court.

“I think one of the strengths of 

our team is that we can put mul-
tiple scorers in at any one time, so 
when we brought in Madison and 
Katelynn and then you have them 
in with (sophomore guard Siera 
Thompson) and Shannon, we have 
four really great threats from the 
outside,” Barnes Arico said. “When 
we haven’t scored in a while, we 
always go to that lineup.”

Barnes Arico’s plan worked. 

Michigan fought back with an 8-0 
run in just over a minute, forcing 
the Tigers to call a timeout. But it 
didn’t help much. Directly after, 
the Wolverines pulled ahead for 
the first time when Smith fed a 
breakaway pass to Goree for a fast-
break layup to make it 15-14.

The first half ended with a lot to 

be desired by the Wolverines. After 
going shot for shot with Missouri 
for a majority of the first half, a 

buzzer-beating open triple left the 
Wolverines trailing, 33-28.

Michigan went back and forth 

with Missouri for the first four 
minutes of the second frame, but 
by the 16:11 mark, it regained the 
lead off of a Goree jumper. Directly 
thereafter, Goree drained another.

“I think at halftime, coach got 

on us about our assists,” Goree 
said. “We usually have 20 assists 
per game, and we only had four at 
(halftime). She told us we weren’t 
moving the ball as much as we 
should, so I think the second half, 
we came out, made extra passes, 
knocked down some shots and 
that’s what got us going.”

Goree wasn’t held back by foul 

trouble, and it made the difference 
— she recorded a double-double 
and didn’t commit any fouls.

The lead was cemented into 

place after her layups, and the Wol-
verines worked up to a 14-point 
advantage with 1:50 left in the 
game off of 59-percent shooting in 
the second half.

But Michigan is priding itself 

more on its defense that grabbed 36 
boards.

“I think our defense was the key 

to our game tonight,” Elmblad said. 
“I thought (Goree) was huge 
down low, and she did a really 
good job of helping. When 
other people were coming 
off of screens or finding open 
looks, she was there to get a 
block or steal, and she was just 
coming through huge with the 
help defense.”

Though Michigan usually 

relies heavily on its 3-point-
ers, it only made one Thursday 
and was still able to dominate 
when it needed to.

The Wolverines bought into 

Barnes Arico’s halftime speech 
about the importance of mov-
ing the ball, and as a result, they 
will travel to Southern Missis-
sippi for a WNIT quarterfinal 
matchup at 2 p.m. Sunday.

FOREST TOWNSHIP, MICH.

Body of student found 

in Genesee County 

State police say a body found 

floating in a pond in Genesee 
County is that of a Wayne State 
University student who disap-
peared from a bar in Otisville 
three months ago.

The Flint Journal and The 

Detroit News say that the body 
found Thursday morning is that 
of 27-year-old Ken Gruno. The 
pond is in Forest Township, just 
outside Otisville and about 12 
miles northeast of Flint.

State police Lt. Ryan Pennel 

says Gruno was carrying iden-
tification. He says there are no 
signs of foul play.

Pennel says a neighbor spot-

ted the body in the pond, which 
remains mostly frozen over.

Gruno left his coat behind 

when he left Otisville Hotel Bar 
in the early hours of Dec. 27. He 
was visiting with high school 
friends at the bar.

Obama commends 
payday lender rules

Embracing 
proposed 
new 

rules aimed at payday lend-
ers, President Barack Obama 
on 
Thursday 
said 
working 

families need protections from 
heavy debt burdens and warned 
Republicans that he would veto 
attempts to unravel regulations 
that govern the financial indus-
try.

Obama praised the Consumer 

Financial Protection Bureau for 
its proposal to set standards on a 
multibillion-dollar industry that 
has historically been regulated 
only at the state level.

“One of the main ways to 

make sure paychecks go farther 
is to make sure working families 
don’t get ripped off,” Obama told 
about 1,800 people at Lawson 
State Community College.

Obama’s remarks come on the 

same day the consumer agency 
was announcing the proposed 
payday lending rules in a hearing 
in Richmond, Virginia. 

NEWS BRIEFS

we really influence the music 
industry five years from now, 10 
years from now?” Baiardi said.

In addition to being one of 

the founders, Baiardi is also fea-
tured on the page as an artist. 
The first song listed on the page 
is hers.

One song, titled “We! are Stu-

dents for Clean Energy Rap,” 
mixes beats and Spanish and 
English lyrics. The song dis-
tills the mission of Students for 
Clean Energy, a campus group 
that promotes the University’s 
use of clean energy.

“Hey listen up ya’ll Wolver-

ines,” the lyrics read. “The sun 
goes down, the sun goes up, time 
to pass that heat around.”

Baiardi said the team hopes 

the 
project 
will 
eventually 

become integrated into student 
organizations on campus. They 
hope to have a cappella groups 
sing their parodies or to work 
with MUSIC Matters, for exam-
ple. They would also like to see 
other University classes engage 
with the project in some form.

While the website’s intended 

audience is students on college 
campuses, Baiardi emphasized 
that anyone can be involved.

“Maybe 
somebody 
doesn’t 

have the capacity to write lyrics, 
but they can write a song or they 
can post a song here and then 
someone else on the other end 
can write lyrics for that piece 
and then upload it and here you 
have this thing that’s produced,” 
she said.

In this way, Fretz said, “Lyric 

Revolution” embodies the idea 
of creativity that lies at the core 
of the class.

“It’s a relatively new course, 

but I would say that this is the 
most fun that I have had teach-
ing in my entire life, because you 
just sort of turn Michigan stu-
dents loose and when you refuse 
to give them a specific guideline 
and they have to come up with 
stuff, the things they come with 
are really amazing,” he said.

T

he surprising thing about 
words is that they can be 
completely ineffective. Com-

ing from a person 
who clearly adores 
words — at least 
enough to have her 
own column — this 
is a strange dec-
laration. But it’s 
exactly because I 
think about words 
more 
than 
the 

average 
person 

that I have had this 
epiphany. (Pretty 
sure I’m a word nerd; I’m even happi-
er because that rhymed, if that gives 
any insight into my thinking).

From taking a variety of history, 

literature and even philosophy class-
es (yes, I’m that kind of student, no 
regrets), I’ve learned that most issues 
in society arise because people can-
not create a universal definition for 
a majority of words. In other words, 
everyone has their own interpreta-
tion, or definition, of a word, and 
they’re unlikely to shift their views. 
When it comes to personal defini-
tions and morals, we’re a deeply stub-
born species. And these personal 
definitions create deep divides over 
some of today’s most pressing issues.

Take 
“sustainability,” 
for 

instance. To me, “sustainability” 
and “living sustainably” mean living 
in lasting harmony with the envi-
ronment. We only get one beautiful 
planet to live on, so we should exist 
with it in a way that preserves its 
complex, interconnected systems.

I think I first developed this way 

of thinking when I was a little girl 
and my parents were teaching me 
how to swim. They always told me 
to respect the water. At the time, I 
didn’t really understand it. Honest-
ly, I thought they just meant ‘don’t 
slap the water,’ because that was 

how I respected my little sister. But 
I think this mantra that reverber-
ated through my childhood stayed 
with me. I have grown up with a 
personified view of the environ-
ment which I believe is deserving 
of the same level of respect as my 
teachers and grandparents.

But everyone has their own family 

and background that shapes the way 
they understand words, especially 
hot-button words such as “sustain-
ability.” I’m sure more conservative 
people associate words like “sustain-
ability” and phrases like “environ-
mentally friendly” as loopy, hippie 
terms that just 
cut down strong 
businesses 
and 

inflate the gov-
ernment. 
And 

those conserva-
tive 
extremists 

aren’t 
com-

pletely 
wrong 

— 
supporting 

sustainable liv-
ing would mean 
keeping 
corpo-

rations like ExxonMobil and others 
with no regard for the environment 
in check. However, that doesn’t 
mean environmentalists are just 
drugged-out, lazy hippies hugging 
trees and aren’t actually doing any-
thing to make a difference.

On the flip side, conservatives are 

not all religion-crazed, big-business 
lovers who want to destroy the envi-
ronment. These negative stereotypes 
and generalizations get in the way of 
actual progress and are deeply unsus-
tainable. It’s all right to have your own 
understanding of a word, but the only 
way to move forward on any issue 
is to try and understand the opposi-
tion’s definition of that word and what 
shaped their understanding.

So, I know this is a bit of a 

paradox, but while words can be 

extremely polarizing, people talk-
ing through these words can break 
down the generalizations. To have a 
sustainable life, we also need to have 
sustainable, healthy relationships 
with others, regardless of our diver-
gent ideologies. That goes beyond 
sustainability and into many of the 
world’s current issues. If we’re able 
to see our “opposition” as people just 
like us, we could actually start creat-
ing durable solutions.

One of the benefits of sustain-

ability is that there are so many 
different ways to move toward liv-
ing a sustainable life that people 

from all differ-
ent 
religions 

and 
political 

ideologies 
can 

take part with-
out compromis-
ing their morals. 
Go 
vegetarian, 

or just cut down 
on meat. Michi-
gan Dining has 
implemented 
“Meatless Mon-

days,” because just one vegetarian 
day per week can make a difference. 
Live a zero-waste lifestyle or start 
recycling. Or next time the cashier 
asks if you want a bag, say no thank 
you. How many plastic Walgreens 
bags does one person need anyway? 
Replace your plastic water bottle 
with a metal or glass one (yes, I’m 
still not over this). Repair clothes 
instead of automatically buying 
new ones. Buy locally grown foods. 
Those are just a few examples of 
how to move to a more sustainable 
life. When I learn more, I’ll share 
them. Hopefully I can help expand 
your definition of sustainability. I’m 
sure you can help with mine.

Defining sustainability

Reevaluating race

I

t has become clear at this point: We, as a 
society, have become very adept at pun-
ishing a specific kind of racism. From the 

racist University of Okla-
homa Sigma Alpha Epsilon 
chanters to the Donald Ster-
ling disaster about a year 
ago, we have become very 
good at pointing out individ-
ual instances of racism. We 
have also, as a consequence 
of this, come to agree that 
making racial remarks of 
any kind is a bad thing. As 
long as nobody says any-
thing about race, nobody 
can be racist, right?

To be seen as racist — to be outed for mak-

ing an ignorant remark pertaining to race — 
now stands as one of the most shameful labels 
we can carry. For me, it’s a very frustrating 
situation to deal with, because the discussion 
always shifts to talking about whether or not 
certain people are actually racist. We get pub-
lic releases from the SAE chanters, Donald 
Sterling, Paula Deen, etc. 
trying to persuade the 
public that they’re not 
racist at all. And it usually 
devolves into something 
like, “Wait, look at this! 
See this photo of me and 
my friend, (insert name 
of an individual of color)? 
See how not-racist that 
makes me?” Instead of 
turning this unfortunate 
situation into an oppor-
tunity to discuss the ways in which minori-
ties continue to face institutional oppression 
(for example in regards to Greek life on school 
campuses), we instead return attention back to 
the very perpetrators of the heinous situation 
that started the whole fiasco.

For the rest of us who don’t receive this kind 

of public attention for our remarks, the behav-
ior is not all that dissimilar. “Why does every-
thing have to be about race?” we say, always in 
defense of something. We’re scared. We don’t 
want to think of ourselves as bad people, and 
what kind of person is worse than a racist? We 
don’t want to believe that, in our own small 
way, we might be contributing to a larger sys-
tem of oppression that has not been eradicated.

As I have said, we have gotten really good 

at noticing a certain brand of racism and then 
teaching others that as long as we don’t say any-
thing related to race, we can’t possibly be racist. 
The consequence of that is counterproductive. 
Dialogue needs to be happening, much more 
than it is, both on campus and in our larger soci-
ety. And to do this, I think we need to reevalu-
ate the permanence of being marked a racist.

By permanence, I mean this: When some-

one, probably unintentionally, says something 
racially problematic, we tend to see their 
whole being as problematic. They are racist 
instead of they said something racist.

Jay Smooth, the host of a popular New York 

hip-hop radio show, gave a TEDx Hampshire 
College talk about just this: the awkward con-
versations we have when we dare to point out 
someone else’s ignorant remarks. In the talk, 
Smooth said, “I think we should consider … 
how we might take a suggestion that we may 
have said or done something racist and take it in 
stride and not completely freak out and assume 
that the world thinks that I’m a bad person.”

His remedy for how we take criticism was 

a simple analogy, one that better captures the 
mentality we should have regarding racist 
comments: “When you go through your day-
to-day lives, there are all of these mass media 
and social stimuli as well as processes that 
we all have inside our brains that we’re not 
aware of that cause us to build up little pock-
ets of prejudice every day, just like plaque 
develops on our teeth.”

It’s a funny but apt anal-

ogy, because it means “rac-
ism” 
is 
something 
that 

needs to be “cleaned” on 
a daily, regular basis. It’s 
something that needs to be 
dealt with in a very direct 
and attentive way. “I have 
something stuck in my 
teeth?” Smooth goes on to 
elaborate. “But I’m a clean 
person!” He shows us how 
ridiculous it sounds to take 

dental hygiene personally the way we might 
take critiques of our comments personally.

We’re “socially hygienic” not because that’s 

who we are, but because that’s what we active-
ly practice. Of course, I should add that by 
choosing not to “maintain” our social aware-
ness regarding race, we let our biases and prej-
udices take a more permanent, damaging turn. 
If left unchecked, they can fester and rot until 
we’re left with something irreversible.

Another final point I want to make is that 

being more socially conscious of race is an 
important step we should take as a school and 
society, but it’s not the final, all-problems-
solved step, not when institutional racism 
continues to hinder people of color regardless 
of how well meaning the vast majority of us 
may be. However, our improved “hygiene” can 
allow us to be more open and willing to listen 
to others’ experiences and critiques, thereby 
opening up the opportunity to shift our insti-
tutional practices on a large scale.

Arabs who? Muslims who? They are born 

and raised here? Can they even call them-
selves Americans? You may have asked ques-
tions like this and been surprised to learn 
about Arab and Muslim American communi-
ties across the nation. Although Muslim and 
Arab are often used synonymously, the terms 
are distinct. The first identity is religious 
and the second is ethnic. The media — what 
is supposed to be our most trusted source of 
information — regularly portrays these com-
munities as one and the same. However, the 
truth is far from that. American Muslims are 
racially and ethnically diverse and can be 
Black, white, Asian, Hispanic, Arab and any 
other race represented on this planet. Also, 
Arab Americans are religiously diverse, and a 
great number are Christians.

On top of not understanding who Arab 

and Muslim Americans are, the normalized 
hate and discrimination against these com-
munities has reached new heights, becom-
ing consistently more aggressive and blatant. 
Three Muslim American college students 
were shot dead in Chapel Hill, N.C.; a Mus-
lim family was physically assaulted while 
grocery shopping in Dearborn; and a mosque 
in Houston was the target of arson — to list 
just a few instances of hate and violence in 
 

recent weeks.

We, as the University community, must 

actively engage in constructive conversa-
tions that will produce tangible results and 

challenge the hostility toward Arab and Mus-
lim Americans. The campaign to TAKE ON 
HATE is a national movement that strives 
to address our country’s growing miscon-
ceptions and discrimination toward Arab 
and Muslim American communities. The 
campaign focuses its efforts on building the 
capacity of these communities, correcting 
cultural misconceptions through public edu-
cation and working with policy makers to 
promote change.

TAKE ON HATE is holding a community 

conversation right here on the University’s 
campus. The aim of the conversation is to 
build greater understanding of and discover 
solutions for the current situation these com-
munities face. Together, we can create solu-
tions to challenge the status quo within our 
communities and build bridges across diverse 
communities. The conversation will include 
a breakout session in which participants 
can brainstorm among small groups of their 
peers, before sharing with the larger group.

Your input will be crucial in influencing 

TAKE ON HATE’s national initiatives. This 
is your chance to connect, learn and share on 
the measures we, as a connected society, can 
take to end the hate. Join us from 6 p.m. to 8 
p.m. on April 2 at the Michigan League in the 
Michigan Room. See you all there!

What can we do to TAKE ON HATE?

Women’s participation in world 

politics has come a long way since 
the post-war, civil and human rights 
movements in the 1960s.

Speaking candidly, anyone with 

the literacy and desire to read a 
newspaper can blatantly see that 
statement is false.

The nature of today’s conflict has 

created a world in which trained 
soldiers on battlefields no longer 
make up the most casualties — 
it’s women and children dying on 
the streets. Beyond the fatality of 
armed conflict, in her paper, “The 
Role of Women in Mediation and 
Conflict Resolution,” author Roohia 
S. Klein describes how “rape, sexu-
al slavery, and other forms of sexual 
violence are used as weapons of war 
in international conflicts.”

In 2000, the United Nations 

passed Resolution 1325, which aims 
to better incorporate the perspec-
tives of women in seeking resolu-
tion and prevention of conflict to 
combat sexual violence. The lan-
guage of this document suggests 
that its text is more of a legal rec-
ommendation rather than an urgent 
call for women’s justice. Resolu-
tion 1325 “urges Member States to 
ensure increased representation 
of women at all decision-making 
levels in national, regional and 
international institutions.” What 
does this piece of paper actually 
 

accomplish in its practice, though?

Women’s rights activist Jody 

Williams is looking to address 
the effectiveness of the resolution 
on world conflict. During a guest 
lecture given at the University, 
she discussed the reality of 1325’s 
implementation in the UN. Though 
the document is a good step, 
women are not represented nearly 
as equally with respect to men in 
peace committees and conven-
tions. The argument goes beyond 
political representation to include 
women in the military body of UN 
peacekeepers. If armed peacekeep-
ing operations had a proportionate 
population of females, there would 
be more emphasis placed on the 
treatment and importance of sexual 
violence in conflict zones.

Along with Jody Williams’ cri-

tique of 1325, Klein gives accurate 
downfalls of the resolution in the 
section of her paper, “SCR 1325 Ten 
Years On.” She directs attention to 
the lack of structural changes with-
in UN bodies to accommodate for 
female representatives. The author 
also points out the absence of time 
constraints or quotas and incen-
tives to implement 1325. These 
together add up to a failure to mea-
sure any real-world effects the res-
olution has truly found.

The UN was founded on the 

ideas of common peace and human 

rights across all member states, but 
its actions to achieve those ideas 
are slightly ironic. It’s a loss of the 
integrity within a system that is 
promising so much to populations 
that have already been stripped 
of human rights. While the fact of 
representation is much debated, 
women make up half of the world 
and there are plenty of them sig-
nificantly more capable than many 
male officials elected or hired to 
serve the UN in finding peaceful 
and lasting resolution to conflict.

Nick Bryant of the BBC defends 

the efforts of 1325 with the Secu-
rity Council; female representa-
tives occupy a third of the seats. 
In addition, the UN boasts 31 per-
manent 
female 
representatives. 

Even Bryant can’t argue with sta-
tistics showing the shortcomings 
of 1325, though, as “84 percent of 
the ambassadors at the UN are 
men. There may be more women at 
the table, but they are still heavily 
 

outnumbered.”

The United Nations has made 

positive strides with their resolve 
to include women in policy making. 
However, it’s not enough to bridge 
the gender participation gap in the 
UN’s infrastructure — thereby fall-
ing short of including the female 
voice in world conflicts.

INTO THE WOODS
From Page 1

STYLE COLUMN

Let’s get it trending
W

hether we admit to 
it or not, one day 
we will look back 

on 2015, with its lobs, smokey 
eyes and high-waisted every-
thing, and 
think, “Dear 
god, why?” 
This type 
of shame-
ridden regret 
has already 
perme-
ated through 
most of us 
in one form 
or another. 
When I 
think back to my childhood, 
flared, patched denim and all, 
I wonder why I ever thought 
anything I wore was cool. Then I 
remind myself that I was in fact, 
a child, and that’s reason enough 
to justify my sartorial missteps. 

What surprises me the most 

is that I can also think back 
to much more recent years, to 
trends that still hold some level 
of relevance, and roll my eyes 
and think “that looks so dated.” 
(see: long, wavy hair with a 
center part à la 2012 Kim Kar-
dashian.) People are already dis-
cussing the looming exit of the 
skinny jean, an idea that I want 
to reject now, but will probably 
succumb to within months. Lest 
I forget how I scoffed at the idea 
of skinny jeans years ago, think-
ing that pants which served 
no other purpose than to cut 
off your circulation altogether 

would never catch on. I was 
obviously a little off-base — she 
types, unable to feel her legs at 
all.

This all begs the question*, 

why bother with trends if we’re 
only going to look back on them 
in horror/embarrassment? For 
one, we could start by not look-
ing back on them in horror/
embarrassment. Would I wear a 
bubble shirt, the itchy, one-size-
fits-all top that reached its peak 
around the same time “Lizzie 
McGuire” did, in 2015? No, 
because I’m not an insane per-
son. But I do hold a lot of respect 
for eight-year-old Erika, who 
pestered her way into one after 
months of eyeing it in a Limited 
Too catalogue. It itched so good 
— until nine-year-old Erika sub-
consciously dubbed it passé.

All of us have fallen prey to 

trends. Whenever I stumble 
upon pictures from the ’90s of 
my style-ignorant father I con-
sistently find myself thinking, “It 
takes one bold color to somehow 
combine the subtlety of a pastel 
and the abrasiveness of neon.” 
There’s no way he cared about 
clothes enough to think that he 
was making some original or 
progressive statement with what 
he was wearing. I can almost 
guarantee that he saw it on a 
rack with dozens of others and 
thought, “I need a shirt and this 
seems normal enough.” And by 
the standards then, it probably 
was. We look back, and we laugh, 
and we ask ourselves how we 

possibly could have worn that, 
but that’s what life is, adjusting 
to change like some sort of vesti-
ary Stockholm syndrome. It only 
took a few months of being sur-
rounded by skinny jeans for me 
to throw up my hands and say, “I 
guess this is what’s covering my 
butt for the next 10 years.”

Whether we find ourselves 

to be fashion visionaries or 
claim to be a person who only 
buys clothes when they abso-
lutely need to, none of us can 
escape the feeling of trend 
regret, but that’s exactly why 
we should embrace our current 
options. If you want to model 
your wardrobe after fall 2015 
Givenchy, facial piercings and 
all, now’s the time. Or if you’d 
rather dig through piles of 
vintage to discover your ideal 
baby-doll dress, have at it. 
Trends are a fleeting pipeline 
to genuinely enjoying fashion 
and being able to discover and 
experiment with style. There 
will always be the potential of 
minute embarrassment years 
down the road — but if you’re 
going to regret something, 
it might as well have been 
inspired by Riccardo Tisci. 

*I’ve recently been informed 

that this is the wrong use of 
“begs the question” but I’m 22 
years old, and frankly, it’s too 
late to be telling me these things.

BOOK REVIEW

By KARL WILLIAMS

Daily Arts Writer

In a notorious essay on Joseph 

O’Neill and Tom McCarthy for 
the New York Review of Books, 
Zadie 
Smith 

outlines 
two 

divergent 
roads for the 
novel: lyrical 
realism 
and 

the 
avant-

garde. 
Most 

fiction 
falls 

under 
the 

category 
of 

lyrical realism; it is the legacy 
of Gustave Flaubert, a mimetic 
attempt to represent life with 
a focus on detail and the 
consciousness 
of 
characters. 

The avant-garde pushes against 
lyrical realism and, instead, 
tries to find new forms and 
modalities for writing fiction. 

Smith eulogizes the coming 

death of lyrical realism, in the 
mode of which O’Neill’s novel 
“Netherland” is written, and 
prophesies the renaissance of a 
new avant-garde written in the 
mode of McCarthy’s first novel 
“Remainder,” a novel that offers 
“a glimpse of an alternate road 
down which the novel might, 
with difficulty, travel forward.” 

Since 
the 
publication 
of 

Smith’s essay, McCarthy, for 
better or worse, has been seen 
as a torchbearer for the avant-
garde, blazing the way for a new 
form of novelistic expression 
after the apparent death of 
postmodernism. 
McCarthy’s 

newest novel, “Satin Island,” 
bears testament to his ability 
and place as a writer of the 
avant-garde. If you’re looking 
for a page-turner, go somewhere 
else. For McCarthy’s narrator 
sums it up: “Events! If you want 
those, you’d best stop reading 
now.”

The narrator of McCarthy’s 

novel is U, an anthropologist 
turned corporate ethnographer 
who 
idolizes 
Claude 
Levi-

Strauss and who has been 
assigned to write “The Great 
Report” 
at 
an 
enigmatic 

corporation 
known 
as 
the 

“Company.” 

At the beginning of the novel, 

he announces himself, “Call 
me U.” ironically evoking the 
opening of Herman Melville’s 
“Moby Dick,” “Call me Ishmael” 
Whereas, when Ishmael says 
this, it is an act of self-assertion, 

U uses this utterance as an act of 
self elision; U is a deliberate pun 
on “you” along with the prefix 
u- (as in Utopia), and he is, 
therefore, both everyman and 
no man. McCarthy’s narrator is 
an impressively passive figure, 
one of those corporate men 
whose sobriety and vacancy 
allows him to fit seamlessly into 
the miasma of corporate life. 

The prose McCarthy deploys 

evinces 
U’s 
inauthenticity: 

It is often blank, cold and 
expressionless, written more 
like a memo than a novel. 
However, the expressive power 
of McCarthy’s prose comes 
from its ironic formalization of 
corporate jargon. 

But 
inauthenticity 
is 
U’s 

greatest characteristic. He is 
no Huck Finn or Augie March. 
U’s interest in the murder of 
an 
English 
parachuter 
and 

similar incidents across the 
world leads him to remark that 
it is “an originally unoriginal 
event 
becoming 
even 
more 

unoriginal, and hence even 
more fascinating.” Within this 
paradox lies the brilliance of U’s 
character. He is compelling for 
how boring he is. He is like every 
man in fiction: He has memories, 
impressions, 
reflections. 
He 

walks. He thinks. He has sex. 
But McCarthy, in a beautifully 
Beckettian move, removes the 
veneer of individuation from 
these characteristics, creating 
a character remarkable for the 
absence of personality.

The Great Report sounds a lot 

like the epic modernist project 
most notable in the work of 
Joyce, Pound and Eliot: an 
attempt to capture all of culture 
within a single text. However, U 
comes to two conclusions: that 
this report is either unwritable 
or it has already been written. 
He fears that the Great Report 
has been written, not by a 
single author or even some 
Pynchonian syndicate, but “by 
a neutral and indifferent binary 
system that had given rise to 
itself, moved by itself and would 
perpetuate itself.” This is post-
digital fear of being subsumed 
into a totality wherein he 
lacks the control to act or 
interpret that motivates him 
to re-conceptualize both the 
Koob-Sassen Project and the 
company and to begin a search 
for a new kind of meaning.

At the Company, U works on 

the Koob-Sassen Project, the 

nature of which he is not legally 
allowed to disclose. However, 
he does not seem to know what 
this project constitutes or even 
his own role in it. All he does 
know is that there isn’t “a single 
area of your daily life that it 
hasn’t, in some way or another, 
touched 
on, 
penetrated, 

changed.” 

In this project McCarthy 

captures the ubiquitous and 
invisible effect of corporations: 
they are so prominent as to be 
unnoticeable. Furthermore, in a 
comic passage, he elucidates the 
ability of corporate capitalism to 
take the critiques raised against 
it and absorb them for its own 
purposes. Think of Che Guevara 
T-shirts or the Rolling Stones 
songs played on car commercials. 
Working for Levi’s, U takes the 
concepts fold and rip from the 
French 
Leftist 
philosophers 

Deleuze and Badiou and, taking 
out “all the revolutionary shit,” 
reframes them to sell jeans. As 
U notes, “The machine could 
swallow anything.”

The title of the novel comes 

from a dream U has. Satin 
Island (Staten Island without 
the first “t”) appears to him in 
a rather baroque dream of the 
detritus of civilization; it is “an 
excrescence, a protuberance, a 
lump: an island.” He imagines it 
as “the other place, the feeder, 
filterer, overflow-manager, the 
dirty, secreted-away appendix 
without which the other body-
proper couldn’t function.” The 
byproduct of civilization, its 
effluvia, is what signifies it; 
it is the very sign that gives it 
meaning.

“Satin Island” is a strange 

and exciting book. McCarthy’s 
novel is one of the rare avant-
garde novels that doesn’t fall 
into the trap of incoherence. 
A new path for the novel is 
certainly not yet visible, but the 
more McCarthy continues to 
write, the more illuminated this 
road will become.

STYLE NOTEBOOK
Men’s calves and legs 
are not to be seen

By ANDREW MCCLURE

Daily Arts Writer

Dudes, out with the shorts. 

I wish I could spin this as my 
own, but I hold too much respect 
for Fran Lebowitz, the sardonic 
author and commenter who, as 
her 1993 Paris Review interview 
put it, “disapproves of virtually 
everything.” This week ELLE 
interviewed her and, per usual, 
she said something inspired and 
funny and realized: Men in shorts 
are disgusting. It gets better when 
she says she’d rather “see some-
one coming toward me with a 
hand grenade” than sit next to 
shorted men “on the subway in 
the summer.” Even though Leb-
owitz is cooler than I ever was 
when I peaked socially back in 
the late 90’s, and her voice has 
a lower register, and her opin-
ions are sharper and leaner than 
things that are at once sharp and 
lean, I agree with every boner in 
my body: Shorts are vile.

First, the anatomical. Calves 

are, in the main, gross to look at. 
It’s the one body part that is never 
just right by any measurable func-
tion. Faces have the “golden ratio” 
and penises have rulers. Calves 
are invariably too skinny or too 
fat or too unshapely or too shape-
ly. Even when they are close to 
“nice,” you can thank some bulg-
ing purple vein or a moon-sized 
mole to fuck it all up. Rats! Try 
again! To be sure, calves are nasty 
and unflattering and exposing 
yours makes you look like a GSI 
who doesn’t know what year it is.

Second, the, er, anatomical, 

again. Legs are, in the main, on 
dudes, gross to look at. This bit 
for the the homies who thought 
they could justify shorts by skip-
ping my first point since they 
like their thighs and wear four-
inch inseams. The only thing 
more exposed leg flesh does to 
you is expose more of your veins 
and moles. So unless “veins and 
moles” falls under your mating 

market’s 
searched-for 
buzz-

words, light your shorts on fire or 
give them to someone who hasn’t 
had braces yet. He’ll rock ‘em 
better than you and wear a Pull-
Up underneath. 

Spring is here and that means 

snapbacks, sun, Sperry’s and 
style bloggers saying, “Spring is 
here and that means…” ad nau-
seam. I understand the utility of 
a tee when it’s hot AF outside, 
I really do. Nobody has ever 
proven to me that moist weather 
demands veins and moles and 
calves. Throw on some slacks 
and roll those cuffs like they 
do in Esquire. There’s a reason 
that publication remains impor-
tant: good writing, captivating 
interviews, sound advice and no 
calves.

Because syntax was never my 

thing, here are other articles 
to avoid this season: socks that 
people can see, flip-flops, tanks, 
frayed belts, unironic graphic 
tees and serial commas.

COURTESY OF MUSKET

This picture was taken moments before Ellen danced through the aisles.

– as they chase after their wish-
es until, eventually, the wishes 
are granted, we break for inter-
mission and return to find our 
heroes facing what happens 
after “happily ever after.”

“I really believe this is a fan-

tastic show with a fantastic 
book, beautiful music, glorious 
lyrics that I really think are 
some of the best lyrics in musi-
cal theater,” Quinn said. “I truly 
am of the belief that ‘Moments 
in the Woods’ is one of the best 
songs ever written for musical 
theater, one of the most specific 
and intense songs.”

Director 
(and 
choreogra-

pher) Quinn explained that, 
long before the curtain opens 
tonight, he and his cast tackled 
these songs and stories like they 
would any other musical, essen-
tially blinding themselves from 
previous performances for the 
sake of original interpretations 
and clean character develop-
ment.

“The way we’ve kind of 

approached this is not that 
there’s a specific concept that 
we’re going with, or a certain 
style or a certain time period, 
but simply that I have gotten the 
script as if it’s a new musical,” 
Quinn said. “I basically have, 
from the beginning, encouraged 
the actors, ‘Don’t watch the 
movie, don’t watch the musical, 
don’t watch that PBS documen-
tary on it ... Instead, find out 
what’s actually in the text.”

From there, the cast of 23 – 

chosen from an audition pool 
of about 300 – developed their 
characters through table reads, 
experimentation and exercis-
es. One exercise, in particular, 
focused on breaking free from 
restrictive blocking and explor-
ing new corners of their charac-
ters’ psyches.

“We took all the props and 

put them in the center of the 
room, and we said, ‘OK, now 
today, we’re gonna do the show, 
but I want you to throw away 
all the blocking you’ve known,” 
Quinn said. “And I just want 
you to do the story in the round 
now, and it will force you out of 
blocking, it will force you out of 
choreography, and it will force 
you to just tell the actual story 
that’s being told.’”

The 
result, 
according 
to 

Quinn, has been an unpredict-
able, vibrant rehearsal pro-
cess and unexpected works of 
striking originality. Over time, 
through six-a-week rehearsals, 
this originality was fostered by 
the cast’s chemistry with one 
another – both off and on the 
stage.

“It’s been really also fun to 

watch people like Sam (Yabrow), 
who’s playing Jack, work with 
the actor who’s playing Milky 
White because they literally had 
never met on the first day, and 
now when you look at them on 
stage, I mean, I at least see them 
as best friends from childhood,” 
Quinn said. “And whether or not 
Paul (Mayer) and Sam actually 
feel that way about each other, 
the relationship that they’ve 

created is really just beautiful.”

And yet, it’s not just the 

actors’ chemistry, comedy and 
approach that define MUS-
KET’s 2015 winter show. Like 
the musical he directs, Quinn is 
striving to subvert the old sto-
ries, to dig deep into the solid, 
impenetrable stone of Sond-
heim and find something new, 
something to hold in front the 
audience and say, “Look at this! 
Have you ever seen anything 
like this?!”

Quinn’s process began with 

the Narrator.

“The one big realization I 

had, and what I guess you could 
say my concept or my key for 
this show – I like to call it the 
‘Key to the Show’ – has been 
the Narrator (played by Mack-
enzie Orr),” Quinn said. “Every 
single thing that happens in this 
show is because of the Narrator 
... Everything that the charac-
ters are saying is coming as well 
from the Narrator, which then 
implied to me that everything 
that is happening on this stage 
is coming from the Narrator’s 
psyche.”

“Well, how’d you incorporate 

that realization into the show?” 
I asked (like a good journalist).

Quinn opened his mouth, but 

hesitated. A sound, the begin-
nings of an answer, escaped 
from the back of his throat 
before he stopped himself and 
said he’d rather not divulge any-
thing, that this show has a few 
“secrets” that are too good to 
give away just yet. Yet.

“The Narrator functions in a 

much more present, powerful 
and in-your-face way than the 
traditional Narrator of ‘Into the 
Woods’ would,” Quinn said.

Post-interview and off-the-

record, Quinn divulged those 
secrets. I had shivers – the kind 
that start at the base of your 
spine and work their way into 
your brain like an electric cur-

rent. It’s so simple, I thought. So 
brilliantly simple. And yet, like 
nothing you’ve ever seen.

As I packed up, Quinn told 

me how he sat in his room last 
semester, with tears in his eyes, 
asking himself again and again, 
“What the hell am I gonna do 
with the Narrator?” until, final-
ly, it hit him. He picked up the 
phone, called his producer Ryan 
and said, “Hey this may never 
work, but I wanna throw this at 
you.”

Since last May, Quinn has been 

working on this show, shaping a 
production that would eventually 
involve over 200 students, from 
creative teams to cast to crew to 
orchestra to assistants to the mar-
keting team and so on, all with a 
single, unshakeable, unwavering 
drive to reshape what has been 
sculpted over countless times.

“A million actors have played 

the Witch, a million actors have 
played the Baker’s Wife, a million 
actors have played Jack – but no 
one has done it like these actors. 
No one has given these interpre-
tations,” Quinn said.

From proposal to late night 

phone calls to production meet-
ings to tech week, Quinn, his 
crew, his entire cast, have dedi-
cated themselves to telling a 
story worth telling and offering 
something more, something real 
and significant. Where the crazi-
ness isn’t just craziness anymore.

“I would call Ryan (the pro-

ducer) almost every week being 
like, ‘I have this new crazy 
idea!’ and then the crazy ideas 
became a little less crazy in 
January when we had auditions 
and then they became a little less 
crazy when I was going through 
design concept meetings and 
they became a little less crazy as 
I was rehearsing it with the cast 
and now those ideas aren’t crazy 
anymore. Those ideas are real-
ity and those are ideas that are 
physically built and manufac-
tured and created.”

At the Power Center, this 

weekend, for only three per-
formances, audiences can see 
something crazy. A twist. A 
subversion. A real change. Like 
“Into the Woods,” MUSKET has 
taken an old story, unraveled its 
fabric and sewn something new, 
something that’s never been 
seen before, at least not out-
side of a director’s imagination. 
Until now.

“It’s so simple, 
and yet, like 

nothing you’ve 

ever seen.”

‘Monologues’ to 
tell women tales

Play returns to the 

‘U’ with diverse 
cast and female 
empowerment

By GRACE HAMILTON

Daily Arts Writer

For students touring the Uni-

versity, their starting point is 
often the Michigan Union on 
State Street. For 
the past month, 
an 
enormous 

banner has wel-
comed 
these 

students 
with 

“The 
Vagina 

Monologues” 
stretched con-
fidently across 
the arch of the 
entrance, deco-
rated with pink 
and purple. The 
bold placement 
of 
the 
sign, 

unable 
to 
be 

missed by pass-
ersby, 
echoes 

the confidence 
of 
the 
play 

it 
promotes. 

There’s no beating around the 
bush here. 

This Thursday and Friday, 

March 26 and 27, Eve Ensler’s 
triumphant 
play 
of 
female 

empowerment will be performed 
at Rackham Auditorium and the 
Trotter Multicultural Center. 
This is the 5th annual showing 

of “The Vagina Monologues,” 
sponsored 
by 
Students 
for 

Choice, a student organization 
which advocates for pro-choice 
legislation. 

The cast of 15 is a diverse 

group of women ranging in age, 
race and acting experience. 
With recent criticism of the play 
for being non-inclusive of cer-
tain identities, “our mission has 
been to prove to people that it’s 
still relevant and that we are 
being as inclusive as we possibly 
can; there is a place for everyone 
to be in and enjoy this play,” said 
year’s director Kayla Smith, an 
LSA sophomore. 

Both Smith and producer 

Rhani Franklin, an LSA sopho-
more, are new to theater at the 
University, and first time direc-
tors and producers. This fact 
seems only to have added to the 
strength of their vision and con-
nection to the play. 

“Art and performance can be 

a really powerful way to com-
municate a message and enact 
social change,” Smith said of the 
play. “‘The Vagina Monologues’ 
will make you laugh, it’ll make 
you cry, but it will also make 
you think about real issues.”

The breadth of issues that the 

play is able to address makes it a 
powerful catalyst for conversa-
tion and thought. 

“It’s fun and different and 

shocking,” 
Franklin 
said. 

“There’s so much I wouldn’t 
have thought to talk to people 
about until seeing this play.” 

Beyond 
just 
being 
a 

conversation starter, the play is 

a call for action. 

“It also encourages activism 

for ending violence against 
women and gender violence to 
college campuses,” said Kylee 
Smith, an actor in the play, said. 
Kylee, a master’s student in the 
School of Social Work, will be 
performing in the play for the 
fifth time this year. 

“The most important message 

is that violence against women 
needs to be stopped,” she said.

While responses to the play, 

both at the University and across 
the nation, have ranged from 
disgust to kneeling praise, “The 
Vagina Monologues” is intend-
ed to relate to all people — men 
included. 

“I think a lot of times when 

people try to explain to men why 
feminism should matter to them, 
they say things like, ‘Well, how 
would you feel if someone did 
this to your mother or daughter 
or sister?’ ” Smith said. “I find 
issue with that because men 
shouldn’t have to feel sympathy 
or that they are involved and 
invested in feminism because 
of someone close to them, they 
should feel this way because 
women are humans, women are 
half the population.” 

College is a time for people to 

enter into conversations they’ve 
never had before, listen to voices 
they’ve never heard and explore 
issues that are shushed in other 
settings. “The Vagina Mono-
logues” presents these challeng-
es and profound privileges, all 
in one. It is guaranteed to open 
some eyes.

A ‘Big Happy’ mess

By SOPHIA KAUFMAN

Daily Arts Writer

Executive 
producer 
Ellen 

DeGeneres and her fellow creators 
of “One Big Happy” have clearly 
realized 
that 

non-traditional 
families 
on 

TV shows are 
proof of being 
socially 
con-

scious. Unfor-
tunately 
for 

their audience, 
they 
seem 

determined 
to prove how 
with the times 
they 
are 
in 

the most grat-
ing and gratuitous ways possible. 
Even the title lends itself too easily 
to criticism — the show is nothing 
more than One Big Flop. 

The pilot opens with Lizzy 

(Elisha Cuthbert, “The Girl Next 
Door”) buying prenatal vita-
mins in a drugstore, accompa-
nied by her straight best friend 
and roommate Luke (Nick Zano, 
“What I Like About You”). The 
two are planning on raising a 
child together and are disap-
pointed when they find out that 
their latest try to get pregnant 
failed. Later, Luke meets a flirty 
and fun Manic Pixie Dream Girl, 
Prudence (Kelly Brook, “Pira-
nha 3D”), who encourages him 
to hop over the bar, fix himself a 
drink like she has done and live 
life to the fullest. She likes sci-
ence fiction and walking around 
the apartment naked for no rea-
son. Predictably, Luke has never 
met a woman like her before and 
is devastated when he finds out 
the beautiful Brit is about to be 
deported. Lizzy can’t wait to see 
Prudence go — after several quips 

about Lizzy not being a “very 
good lesbian” because she prefers 
not to hug Prudence in the nude, it 
is abundantly clear the two don’t 
get along.

Then, Luke and Prudence get 

married, Lizzy tells them she’s 
pregnant and Luke is the father 
and Prudence decides that it is 
too much for her and runs to the 
airport. Lizzy has a change of 
heart, follows her there and gets 
down on one knee to “get the girl” 
for her straight best friend — and 
thus ends the episode in true sit-
com fashion.

“One Big Happy” is full of 

strained one-liners about lesbians, 
stereotypes about straight guys 
and more off-color boob jokes than 
the 2013 Oscars. Brook does the 
best she can with the inherently 
sexist, one-dimensional character 
she has been given, which incor-
porates a lot of hair flipping, forced 
smiles and gratuitous prancing 
around with pixelated body parts. 
Zano looks confused as to wheth-
er he should be emphasizing the 
dude-bro or ready-for-parenthood 
side of his personality, although 
it doesn’t really matter as the one 
is as unbelievable as the other. 
Cuthbert seems to be perpetually 
looking around for a live studio 
audience to appreciate her lines, 
but her hopeful gaze is met only 

with the hollow emptiness of 
canned laughter. The few other 
characters in the show are there 
only to set up jokes so that these 
three can triumphantly deliver 
their punchlines.

There are a few lines that sug-

gest the writers are hesitantly try-
ing to steer the show in a better 
direction, less focused on serious 
plot in favor of pointing out pat-
terns in movies and shows that 
incorporate so many of the same 
banal plot drivers. For example, 
when Lizzy says slowly to Luke’s 
drunkenly slumped form on the 
couch, “Maybe you shouldn’t 
let her get on that plane,” and, 
when he doesn’t understand her, 
exclaims, “Oh my God, have you 
never seen any movie ever?” 

If the writers continue pok-

ing fun at themselves and give up 
pretending this is anything other 
than a low-budget sitcom, they 
might arrive at something worth 
watching. But the main take-
away from the show for people 
who know anything about the 
executive producer is a general 
feeling of disappointment. “One 
Big Happy” is the first sitcom to 
feature a lesbian lead since Ellen 
DeGeneres’s “Ellen,” and it’s 
missing, above all, her wit and her 
spark. Come on, Ellen. We know 
you can do better.

TV REVIEW

Release dates
don’t matter

By RACHEL KERR

Daily Arts Writer

Last week, Kendrick Lamar 

surprised us all by dropping 
his third studio album To Pimp 
A Butterfly. This came only 
days after he announced its 
March 23 release date. And 
while it’s being called an error 
on his label’s part, it only fur-
ther solidifies the fact that the 
release date is dead.

In the age of the Internet, 

labels have struggled to adapt to 
the way people listen to music. 
The CD died its first death 
when Napster was born in 1999, 
and the birth of iTunes in 2003 
finalized this transition into the 
digital music world. But Napster 
had changed something; people 
no longer believed they needed 
to pay for music. Though iTunes 
offered songs for only 99 cents, 
the Internet offered them for 
free. Doors had opened that 
could not be shut. 

Today we have streaming 

services such as Spotify and 
YouTube, which offer royalties 
to artists and require minimal 
payment from us. Still, album 
sales are down, so record labels 
try to combat the allure of the 
Internet. For instance, albums 
will inevitably leak. If your 
favorite artist has something 
out soon, you can probably hear 
it a couple days before some-
where in the crevices of the 
Internet. Artists know this and 
are adopting new promotional 
methods to prevent this, for 
example, by not using any pro-
motional methods.

It began with Beyoncé and 

her 2013 self-titled project; 
arguably the most influential 
artist of our generation ignored 
all album release precedent 
and dropped a full audio-visu-
al album without any prior 
promotion. 
The 
move 
was 

monumental. I mean, every-
one remembers where they 
were the first time they heard 
“Drunk in Love.” This wasn’t 
the only time an artist had dis-

regarded release conventions: 
Frank Ocean dropped CHAN-
NEL Orange on iTunes a week 
early, Radiohead barely gave 
us any notice before King of 
Limbs, Death Grips uploaded 
Government Plates to the Inter-
net with no warning. But some-
thing changed on that fateful 
December night when Beyoncé 
debuted. 

Since then, fellow artists, too, 

have abandoned the traditional 
album rollout. Most recently, 
Drake dropped If You’re Read-
ing This It’s Too Late without 
any announcement, the title 
itself a potential comment on 
the surprise release. And who 
can forget the whole U2 Songs 
of Innocence debacle, where 
everyone with an Apple account 
got the album uploaded to their 
iTunes for free, whether they 
wanted it or not? D’Angelo, 
Skrillex and Kid Cudi also 
made little to no announcement 
before releasing their 2014 proj-
ects, and both Kanye West and 
Rihanna have said that their 
2015 albums will drop when-
ever they want them to, without 
an official date. 

And while there’s an obvi-

ous difference between sur-
prise release dates and surprise 
albums – one involves promo-
tion and the other doesn’t – 
both disregard the calendar. But 
this strategy seems to work in 
an era where people want easy 
access to everything, where 
people want everything right 
now. Take Beyoncé, for instance. 
It sold over 800,000 copies in 
the first three days, despite no 
promotional 
announcements. 

What’s the point of putting a 
specific date on the release 
when the album will sell just as 
many copies, if not more, with-
out it? 

So, 
I’m 
glad 
Kendrick 

dropped his album early. After 
a year of artists forsaking tra-
ditional promotional strategies, 
I almost thought it was a little 
lame that he was even giving us 
a release date.

Big Ten preview: Wins are 

there for the taking

By ISAIAH ZEAVIN-MOSS

Daily Sports Writer

The Michigan baseball 

team, after a season of 
playing 
.500 
baseball 

and a quick postseason 
elimination, sets out on 
this year’s conference play 
with a firm belief that it can 
bring home success, pride 
and, perhaps, hardware.

Fortunately 
for 
the 

Wolverines, the Big Ten does not 
boast unusually formidable talent. If this season is to truly represent a 
turning point, Michigan will have to hold its own inside the conference. 
Here is a preview of the Big Ten’s best in 2015.

No. 11 Maryland (3-0 Big Ten, 17-5 overall)

The Terrapins, who are playing their inaugural season in the Big Ten 

after making the switch from the ACC, represent this year’s toughest 
competition. Maryland’s offense ranks first in batting average, on-base 
percentage, runs scored and home runs. Before its loss to James Madison 
on Tuesday, Maryland strung together a 10-game win streak in which it 
scored 9.9 runs per game.

Though Maryland’s pitching staff ranks in the middle of the Big Ten 

in most team statistics, sophomore fireballer Mike Shawaryn leads the 
Big Ten in strikeouts and wins. Last season, Shawaryn was a Freshman 
All-American.

Player to watch: Infielder Brandon Lowe
Lowe is the leader of Maryland’s elite offense, hitting .402. Lowe 

also leads the Big Ten in hits, runs and slugging percentage. Last 
season, Lowe was named to the Freshman All-American Team and 
led the team in batting average as a freshman.

No. 17 Illinois (17-5)

One of the biggest surprise stories in this young season has been 

the success of the Fighting Illini. After a quick exit in the Big Ten 
Tournament last season, few expected to see the elite performance 
that Illinois has put on thus far. Nevertheless, the Fighting Illimi is 
second in the Big Ten in both home runs and total bases.

Player to watch: Left-handed pitcher Kevin Duchene
Duchene leads an Illinois pitching staff that leads the Big Ten 

in team earned-run average (2.08) and opposing batting average 
(.201). Duchene has allowed just two runs all season and is third in 
the Big Ten in opposing batting average (.167).

No. 19 Indiana (1-1, 16-5)

In 2014, the Hoosiers won the Big Ten Tournament and went 

on to make it to the NCAA Regionals. Two players from last year’s 
team, Dustin DeMuth and Joey DeNato, graduated and were 
drafted professionally.

Indiana has found similar success this year. It has won 13 of its 

last 14, and the Hoosiers do it by crushing the baseball. Indiana is 
second in slugging percentage (.410) and third in home runs (14).

Player to watch: Right-handed pitcher Thomas Belcher
Belcher leads a staff that ranks third in team ERA and opposing 

batting average. Belcher has allowed just 16 hits in 22.2 innings, and is 

the only starting pitcher in the Big Ten yet to walk a batter.

Nebraska (3-0, 18-7)

With last weekend’s sweep of Michigan, the Cornhuskers 

started this year’s conference play on a perfect note. Already this 
season, Nebraska has put together an 11-game win streak and, 
although they went on to lose, the Cornhuskers brought the tying 
run to the plate against No. 1 LSU. Sophomore designated hitter 
Ben Miller is third in the conference in hits (31) and RBI (23).

Player to watch: Left-handed pitcher Kyle Kubat
The seasoned Kubat has been lights-out this season, with a 
1.60 ERA and four wins. He has been a workhorse for coach 
Darin Erstad this season, logging 39.1 innings, good for third 
in the Big Ten.

Ohio State (2-1, 15-6)

Coming into this season, the Buckeyes, similar to 

Michigan, had a vision of a team finally producing tangible 
results.

“Last year, we had a young team and dealt with a lot of 

adversity,” said Ohio State coach Greg Beals, in the days 
before opening day. “We are confident we are a much 
tougher team this season.”

So far, the young Buckeyes have shown promise. 

The pitching staff, almost entirely comprised of 

underclassmen, has posted a 2.58 team ERA, ranking 

fifth in the Big Ten.

Player to watch: Left-handed pitcher Ryan Riga
After a junior year that left many wanting more 
— his ERA ballooned to 4.33 by season’s end — 
Riga has used his seniority for extra motivation. 
Leading the team in almost all major categories, 
Riga’s 0.98 ERA is good for third in the Big Ten.

Iowa (14-5)

Though they have yet to play any ranked opponents, the Hawkeyes 

have had success, despite playing just two games within the friendly 
confines of Iowa City.

Despite the success, Iowa struggles to stand out on either side of the 

ball. The only statistic in which the Hawkeyes lead the Big Ten is hit 
batters. Ouch.

Player to watch: Right-handed pitcher Calvin Matthews
Matthews has been astounding this season. Having only let across 

one earned run in 26 innings, he leads the Big Ten in ERA (0.35).

Rutgers (2-1, 6-14)

After losing 13 of their first 16 games to start the season, things looked 

to be spiraling downward fast for the Scarlet Knights. But last weekend, 
Rutgers traveled to West Lafayette and took two of three from pesky 
Purdue is now riding a four-game win streak. Junior pitcher Howie 
Brey, who surrendered only one run in seven innings Saturday, is eighth 
in the Big Ten in strikeouts (29).

Player to watch: Outfielder Tom Marcinczyk
Marcinczyk is the third hitter in the Rutgers lineup, batting .356 with 

a .603 slugging percentage and 18 RBI.

Michigan State (1-2, 10-11)

Though they have not been able to find any consistency, the Spartans 

can at least hang their hat on being always on their toes — they lead 
the Big Ten in runners picked off (eight) and are fourth in fielding 
percentage (.974).

Player to watch: Infielder Mark Weist
Weist is the only Spartan hitting above .300, ranking 15th in the 

conference in batting average (.341).

Purdue (1-2, 9-14)

While Purdue may not win very many games this season, the 

Boilermakers will make you work to get them out. They are second in 
the Big Ten in walks (88), as well as batters hit by pitch (28). They are 
currently on a four-game losing streak, most recently in an 8-2 loss to 
Ball State.

Player to watch: Left-handed pitcher/first baseman Kyle Wood
Wood is not only the catalyst of Purdue’s offense — he is the only 

Boilermaker to be hitting above .300 (.370) — but he has also posted a 
1.69 ERA in two relief appearances.

A

round the time that Barry Larkin was playing for the Michi-
gan baseball team in the 1980s, the team was wildly success-
ful. In that 10-year span, the Wolverines went to nine NCAA 

regionals, won seven Big Ten titles and earned four trips to the Col-
lege World Series, comprising what many consider to be a decade of 
dominance unlike many others in the sport’s history. There were All-
Americans, Big Ten Players of the Year, first-round MLB draft picks 
and future Hall of Fame players throughout the roster. They came 
together to propel the program into the national spotlight.

And a similar stretch could be on the horizon.
But to get there, Michigan coach Erik Bakich will need to recapture 

the intangible elements that allowed those teams to 
be great.

When asked why he decided to come to 

Michigan, Larkin said more than anything it came 
down to the core values stressed in 
Ann 

Arbor that made him feel at 
home.

“Some of the things that 

were really stressed in my 
household were extended 
when I came up here,” he 
said. “There’s something 

about the values and what’s important 
to the people. The other thing was 
just the people surrounding 
the 
program, 
the 

people around the 
University 
of 

Michigan.”

During 

his recent 

induction to the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame, Larkin shared more of 
his experiences on being recruited to Ann Arbor. As Larkin grew to be 
a standout football player in Cincinnati, he caught the eye of legendary 
football coach Bo Schembechler, who gave him a spot on the football 
team at Michigan.

When an unexpected player returned for his fifth year on the team at 

Larkin’s position, Schembecher allowed the freshman to take a redshirt 
year and play baseball during spring season instead of working with the 
football team.

“By the end of that season I decided I just wanted to play baseball,” 

Larkin said. “I had to go tell Bo that … and the meeting didn’t go too well. 
He reminded me, ‘Larkin, this is the University of Michigan. Nobody 
comes to the University of Michigan to play baseball.’ ”

Schembechler told Larkin to go home and come back the next day 

when he had come to his senses, but nothing would change in his mind.

“I thought that was the end of it,” Larkin said. “But we were out there 

taking ground balls in spring baseball practice and this guy in a parka 
comes walking inside the stadium and stops on the third-base line. He 
says, ‘Larkin, you sissy! Come hit a man that can hit you back instead of 

that baseball.’ It was Coach Schembechler.”

Telling one of the most storied coaches in the history of college 

football something he didn’t want to 

hear was one of the best 

moves 
Larkin 

made in his life. In 
his college career, 

Larkin went on to be a 

two-time All American, 

two-time Big Ten Player of 

the Year and lead the team to 

the College World Series in back-

to-back seasons.

By recruiting the best talent the Midwest has to offer, along with 

using ties from his time in California and the East Coast, Bakich is 
putting the fruits of his first true recruiting class to work right away. 
And the results will prove impressive.

The tangible rankings are nice to look at. This year’s recruiting class 

came in at No. 20 in the nation, and for the first time in a few years the 
Wolverine coaching staff has enough veteran firepower to shelter some 
of the young players from jumping into game action too quickly. For the 
handful of freshman players who are getting playing time, the results 
are largely positive.

The standouts from this 2015 class have been second baseman Jake 

Bivens, who is hitting .304 and has started in 21 games this season, along 
with right-hander Ryan Nutof, who has proven to be a reliable starting 
pitcher for the Wolverines through six appearances in his young career. 
Another is right-hander Bryan Pall, who has a minuscule 0.63 earned-
run average through 14.1 innings of relief. Others could emerge in due 
time this season.

While those rankings can sometimes predict on-field success, they 

can’t often measure the field of character.

From a Michigan coach’s perspective, you look for a combination of 

talent on the field, in the classroom and as a leader in the players you’re 
recruiting. The types of players Bakich seems to be looking for have 
to be strong in all three phases of that evaluation to have a spot in the 
program.

Bakich has a ways to go with the current team in both on- and off-

field areas, but make no mistake about it: When firing on all cylinders, it 
has no ceiling. Some year in the near future, people around the program 
will know it’s “the year.” The right blend of baseball talent and passion 
for Michigan will come together and propel this program back to that 
decade of dominance it experienced in the 1980s.

This year might not be the one where it all comes together for the 

Wolverines, but following Bakich’s vision, “the year” won’t be far off.

Cronenworth: Two skills, one player

By NATHANIEL CLARK

Daily Sports Writer

Jacob Cronenworth stars as both a first baseman 

and closer for the Michigan baseball team. But there 
was a time when that was far from a certainty.

When Cronenworth first arrived in Ann Arbor in 

the fall of 2012, he was six feet tall and 150 pounds, a 
far cry from the prototypical baseball prospect.

“We weren’t sure about (Cronenworth),” said 

Michigan coach Erik Bakich. “We weren’t sure if he 
was just a pitcher or just an infielder, so we let him 
do both.”

But Bakich saw that Cronenworth played hockey 

at St. Clair High Schoo (Michigan) as well as for 
Team USA in the 2009 National Team Identification 

Series. The rough physical nature of hockey requires 
players to be fearless, and Cronenworth fit the bill.

“Normally where I’ve recruited before, when 

you found a kid who played high-school football, 
you found a type of toughness,” Bakich said. “In the 
Upper Midwest, that’s the hockey mindset. I like 
recruiting guys that play multiple sports.”

Cronenworth’s toughness ensured that Bakich’s 

concerns faded quickly. In the offseason, he added 
an extra 20 pounds of muscle to his frame. 

The growth paid dividends right away. At the 

plate in 2013, he hit .320 with 41 RBI — good for 10th 
in the Big Ten. In the process, he reached base in 21 
consecutive games and posted a 16-game hit streak. 
The strong play was enough to earn him a spot on the 
Big Ten All-Freshman Team and All-Big Ten second 

team honors. He was even named 
a Lousiville Slugger Freshman 
All-American.

His fearlessness paid off on 

the mound, too. Cronenworth 
finished 2013 with 23.1 innings 
pitched, seven saves and a 1.93 
ERA. He surrendered a scant five 
walks during the season.

Yet while he is certainly 

pleased that he exceeded Bakich’s 
early expectations, Cronenworth 
insists that he does not take too 
much pride in that fact. Which 
may come from his family includ-
ing two hockey players — one of 
whom was a U.S. Marine.

“I like to stay humble about 

everything,” Cronenworth said. 
“(The coaching staff) has treated 
me very well, and I’ve put in the 
time to be in the position that I 
am. I thank them for that.”

Friday, Cronenworth — the 

man who was once unsure that 
he would even have a position 
to play for the Wolverines — will 
make his first pitching start for 
Michigan against No. 20 Mary-
land. In the wake of last week-
end’s humiliating three-game 
sweep at the hands of Nebraska, 
Bakich felt the team needed a 
spark, and that Cronenworth is 
just the man to deliver it.

“I just told (Cronenworth) to 

close every inning,” Bakich said. 
“He’ll blow it out for as many 
innings as he can go.”

Cronenworth is approaching 

the challenge just as he has every 

other in his life: with the confidence and toughness 
he gained from hockey.

***

It would be a misnomer, though, to say that 

Cronenworth came out of nowhere when he joined 
the Wolverines. His characteristic fearlessness pro-
pelled him to become a four-time varsity letterwin-
ner as a two-way player for St. Clair. He also made 
the All-State first team twice, in 2011 and 2012.

But it was Cronenworth’s junior season that sticks 

out from his high-school career. At the plate he hit 
.564 with 18 doubles and 46 RBI, and on the mound 
he posted a 10-0 record and a 1.82 ERA. In the 
Saints’ 4-1 victory in the Division 2 state champion-
ship game, Cronenworth pitched a complete-game 
three-hitter.

“That whole season was one of the greatest expe-

riences of my life,” Cronenworth said. “Nearly every-
one on that team was a junior or a senior, and we grew 
up playing little-league baseball together. We always 
stay in touch since most of us play college sports.”

At Michigan, Cronenworth proved his freshman 

year was no fluke. Last year, he pitched 25.2 innings 
over 18 contests, notched 12 saves — a single-season 
record for a Michigan pitcher — and put up a 1.79 
ERA in the process.

“I just try to have a good routine every time I 

come to the park,” Cronenworth said. “I try to stay 
consistent.”

As for his time at the plate, while his 2014 bat-

ting average was a somewhat disappointing .268, he 
made up for it by doing the little things. He started 
all 60 games, drew 41 walks, placed 11 sacrifice 
bunts, hit four triples and stole 19 bases. His hockey 
discipline came in handy.

Cronenworth’s relatively low batting average 

from 2014 didn’t phase him, though. He just went 
right back to work with the same tenacity he has 
always had.

As a result, this season so far has been even more 

successful for Cronenworth. He is currently batting 
.312 with six doubles — the same number he hit in all 
of 2014 — a home run and 18 runs batted in. 

“(Cronenworth’s) plate discipline and strike-zone 

knowledge are outstanding,” Bakich said. “He’s 
really turned into a complete player. It’s rare to come 
across a two-way player like Cronenworth, because 
it’s hard to do.”

His fearless didn’t fade with time. It has only 

grown over the years.

***

Cronenworth’s dual threat has gained him both 

recognition for his play and interest from big-league 
franchises. This year, he was named a Preseason 
First-Team All American by two different organiza-
tions. He also was named the sixth-best MLB draft 
prospect in the Big Ten by Perfect Game. In short, 

people are taking notice of this fearless athlete.

“You have to be very gifted to be a great two-way 

player,” Bakich said. “You can’t focus 100 percent on 
either hitting or pitching. Jacob is naturally gifted at 
both.”

And Cronenworth has no shortage of gratitude 

for the opportunity to play two positions.

“I love playing both positions,” Cronenworth said. 

“Kudos to the coaching staff for letting me do this. It 
could go either way in the future.”

Still, he refuses to dwell too much on the future, 

preferring instead to simply focus on the Wolver-
ines’ season.

“Right now, I’m in my college season,” Cronen-

worth said. “We’re in the midst of starting Big Ten 
play which is very important for us. What happens 
in June will happen.”

***

Through it all, Cronenworth has always been able 

to count on the support of his family. He credits his 
father, Charles E. Cronenworth, for inspiring him to 
play baseball and for helping to instill the tough, dis-
ciplined attitude that he carries to this day.

“My dad had a heavy influence on my athletic 

career in general,” Cronenworth said. “I model a lot 
of what I do after what he did.”

Cronenworth’s family is also responsible for his 

love of hockey. Both his father and grandfather, 
Charles L. Cronenworth, played hockey at Michigan 
Tech.

The elder Cronenworth was even offered a try-

out with the New York Rangers in 1944, but instead 
chose to enlist in the United States Marine Corps 
where he obtained the rank of First Lieutenant.

Toughness runs in the family.
“My biggest hockey influence was my grandpa,” 

Cronenworth said. “He taught me how to skate.”

But of all of Cronenworth’s fans, none match the 

dedication of his grandmother, Lorraine. She has 
been to every one of his games. She isn’t afraid of 
weather, travel or anything else. She just wants to 
see Jacob play. In many ways, Lorraine’s fearless-
ness is just like Jacob’s.

“She’ll be sitting right in the first row,” Cronen-

worth said. “Rain, snow, wind, sun shining, cold — 
she’s here every game. I really appreciate her coming 
out to support me.”

The appreciation extends beyond just Cronen-

worth himself, though.

“My grandma always brings cookies for the team,” 

Cronenworth said. “They love it. It’s awesome.”

While Cronenwroth will fill in as Michigan’s 

starting pitcher Friday, he’ll most likely remain the 
team’s closer and first baseman.

But with Cronenworth, you never really know. 

He’s never been afraid of taking on new tasks, 
whether it’s a new position or a new sport. His atti-
tude toward being the Wolverines’ starting pitcher 
will be no different.

Inside Bakich’s deepest 
team of Michigan tenure

By DANNY VARGOVICK

Daily Sports Writer

After finishing near the middle of the pack in each 

of Michigan coach Erik Bakich’s first two seasons 
at the helm in Ann Arbor, expectations are higher 
this year for one simple reason: the roster is bet-
ter. Below, the Daily breaks down the Wolverines’ 
improved roster for the 2015 season.

Outfield

On offense, it all starts with senior centerfielder 

Jackson Glines. Coming off a second-team All-Big 
Ten performance last year, Glines’s sweet line-drive 
swing hasn’t disappointed this season. He hasn’t 
shown the doubles power that he did last year when 
he had the third-most in the conference, but he’s still 
hitting an astounding .453 — leading the Big Ten by 
50 points — and owns a 1.082 OPS.

Outside of Glines, junior left fielder Cody Bruder 

arrived in Ann Arbor this year and has immediately 
held down a corner outfield spot. He’s second on the 
team with a .330 average, but he’s closer to the mid-
dle of the pack among regulars in terms of on-base 
percentage and slugging percentage.

Senior right fielder Kevin White has been the 

main starter in the other corner outfield spot oppo-
site Bruder. He has just 51 at-bats on the season com-
pared to Bruder’s 91, even though White currently 
owns a higher on-base percentage and slugging per-
centage than Bruder.

Infield

Junior first baseman Jacob Cronenworth plays 

Robin to Glines’ Batman in the lineup. Cronenworth 
has led off every game this season, getting on base 
at a .418 OBP. He excels at drawing walks and is 
the fastest player on the team, according to Bakich. 
Cronenworth, listed at just 167 pounds, has played 
mostly first base this year despite experience in the 
middle infield. Bakich says that having a middle 
infielder play first improves the team’s defense dras-
tically and allows him to be creative with bunt cov-
erages.

Freshman second baseman Jake Bivens has 

been a revelation since being thrust into the every-
day lineup due to junior shortstop Travis Maezes’s 
injury. He doesn’t hit for much power — he has just 
four doubles and no triples or home runs on the sea-
son — but he’s hitting .304 mainly because he barely 
strikes out. His six whiffs are lowest among the reg-
ulars, and he has either been walked or hit 17 times, 
which ties him with Cronenworth for the team lead. 
This makes the slap-hitting left-hander an attractive 
option in the second spot against righties.

Senior shortstop Eric Jacobson has hit ninth all 

year, but impressed with a .298 average. The cap-
tain is the ultimate team player and quintessential 

coach’s kid and moved over to shortstop following 
Maezes’s injury. He has done everything Bakich 
could have expected from him so far, but there is 
reason to be concerned: He has walked only once 
this year and has just one double, so if his batting 
average on balls in play — currently .347, which is 
likely unsustainable — dips, his effectiveness could 
be limited.

Junior designated hitter Carmen Benedetti 

boasts the most consistent power on the team and 
hits cleanup. Benedetti is second on the team in slug-
ging and leads the team in RBI with Cronenworth 
and Glines setting the table in front of him.

Starters

The starters are talented and young for Michi-

gan. Sophomore left-handed pitcher Brett Adcock, 
sophomore right-handed pitcher Keith Lehmann 
and freshman right-handed pitcher Ryan Nutof have 
been the Wolverines’ top three starters, while fresh-
man Jayce Vancena figures to get midweek starts.

Adcock is a power pitcher who will get his fastball 

all the way up to 94 miles per hour. Bakich described 
his slider as a “swing and miss pitch.” He also throws 
a change and a curve.

The team’s Opening Day starter, Adcock sports a 

5.40 ERA on the season. His impressive 8.78 strike-
outs per nine innings is mitigated by his 7.76 walks 
per nine innings.

He has been as hot and cold as any pitcher could 

possibly be. He started the season out slowly, then 
was named the Big Ten Pitcher of the Week on 
March 2 for his two-hit, 11-strikeout, complete-
game shutout of Siena. He then went ice-cold again 
against Nebraska when he allowed six runs in 1.2 
innings.

Lehmann can get his fastball up to 91 miles per 

hour, but its effectiveness is based more off its move-
ment than its velocity. Bakich called Lehmann a 
“sinker-slider guy who’s also got a curveball, cutter 
and changeup.”

Junior left-handed pitcher Evan Hill is expected 

to return from injury soon. He led the Wolverines 
in innings pitched last year and posted a shiny 3.24 
ERA, so his return will undoubtedly be huge.

Relievers

In the bullpen, Cronenworth returns as closer. 

Despite his talent at the plate, Bakich says that 
Cronenworth’s future is on the mound. He has a 2.79 
ERA on the season and has the ability to come in at 
the end of games and get some swings and misses, 
evidenced by his 10.24 strikeouts per nine innings, 
while still limiting walks.

Top to bottom, this squad is the deepest team 

Bakich has had at Michigan, and he returns almost 
all of his top players, so it’s not hard to see why 
expectations are high in Ann Arbor.
