Daily Staff Reporter
A handful of Northwood
Community Apartments resi-

they will have to find a new place
to live come next April.
Some residents in Northwood
I, II and III received an e-mail
this week notifying them that
they will be need to vacate their
apartments by the end of April
2012 due to construction to the
buildings.After movingout, they
will have to find a new residence
in another Northwood building,
if they choose, since the other
apartments will be reserved for
freshmen.
A day after receiving the
e-mail, the residents met to
express their concerns and dis-
appointment at a public forum
organized by University Hous-
ing at the Northwood Commu-
nity Center on Tuesday.
Construction on the North-

wood buildings are expected to
occur between May and August
2012.
The updates to the North-
wood apartments are separate
from University Housing's Ser-
vices' Residence Life Initia-
tives, which includes the recent
renovations of Mosher-Jordan
Residence Hall and Stockwell
Residence Hall and the con-
struction of North Quad Resi-
dential and Academic Complex,
as well the current renovations
to Couzens Residence Hall and
next year's revamp of Alice
Lloyd Residence Hall.
University Housing spokes-
man Peter Logan said in an
interview after the meeting that
the updates to the apartments
will include boiler replacements
and the installation of new fire
safety systems. The renovations
are necessary since the apart-
ments were constructed more
thans 50 years ago, he said.
"The boilers for Northwood
I, II and III are near their life's
end," Logan said. "So in looking
at the timing of this, we thought
that we really shouldn't put off
the replacement of the boilers
any longer than we need to."

By JOSEPH LICHTERMAN

Chants of "Rick is wrong"
reverberated throughout the
Fleming Administration Build-
ing yesterday afternoon as about

30 people filed into University
President Mary Sue Coleman's
office.
The student protestors were
expressing their dissent with
the University's decision to have
Republican Gov. Rick Snyder
deliver the Spring Commence-
ment address next month.
Organized by LSA senior
Zach Goldsmith, the rally start-
ed on the Diag, growing to a
crowd of about 100, with some
protestors subsequently mov-
ing to Fleming. Goldsmith said

he hoped the protest would send
a message to the University's
Board of Regents and University
administrators that students
do not support the University's
choice to have the governor
deliver the graduation address:
The regents are expected
to approve Snyder as the com-
mencement speaker at their
meeting in Detroit today.

The Department of Pub-
lic Safety is offering $500
rewards for anyone with infor-
mation regarding a recent
sexual assault near campus
and an aggravated assault that
occurred last month.
In a crime alert update sent

to students, faculty and staff
yesterday afternoon, DPS wrote
that it will provide $500 to any-
one who has "information that
leads to an arrest" in the sexual
assault incident that occurred
early Saturday morning.
A female student was assault-
ed at about 12:45 a.m. on Sat-
urday, March 12 by four males
between the ages of 18 and 24.
The original crime alert from
March 12 states that the student
was walking by herself north of
the South Forest Parking Struc-

Ave. The assault occurred in the

corridor between the structure
and the South University Gal-
leria Shopping Center, which is
located at 1214 South University

For the price of $4 per stu-

Brought together by rare hair

The Weasley family in the
Harry Potter series and the "Gin-
ger Kids" episode in South Park
have given redheads widespread
exposure on the big and small
screens. And one student organi-
zation hopes to continue this pub-
licity of individuals who make up
roughly 2 percent of the United
States population.
The group, called The Red-
Headed League of Michigan,
was established about a year ago
with the aim to promote red-
head awareness on campus. After
spending a semester in a class that
had an unusually high number of
redheaded students, LSA seniors
Bridget Bodnar, Tom Burson and
Kelli Bosak decided to make the

group official.
Bodnar said though the club's
initial founders are all redheads,
the club isn't reserved exclusively
for students with red hair. It is
difficult to say the total number of
members right now because the
door of membership is constantly
revolving, she said.
"I hope that we can continue to
build the number of people who
are involved," Bodnar said.
Bodnar said she and the other
members of the club are looking
forward to their St. Patrick's Day
event today - a sit-in at Wendy's
in the Michigan Union, followed
by a bar crawl.
Aside from being a social
club, The Red-Headed League of

Michigan is involved in volunteer
work around campus that not
only benefits redheads, but also
blondes and brunettes, like hand-
ing out samples of sunscreen to
passing students in Angell Hall.
Bodnar said she hopes the
club continues to grow, but more
importantly, also maintains a
lighthearted and social atmo-
sphere. She said there is always
an implicit acknowledgment
when redheads see each other.
"It's different from many of the
other clubs that you might find on
campus because we want to have
fun. We're not trying to sell any-
thing or go anywhere," she said.

UNITED NATIONS (AP)
- Supporters of a no-fly zone
over Libya called for a Security
Council vote today on a U.N.
resolution aimed at prevent-
ing Moammar Gadhafi's planes
from conducting aerial attacks
on the Libyan people.
t Britain and France put a draft

yesterday. The text was sent to
capitals overnight and could still
be changed before being put to a

vote in the 15-member council.

that we may be in a position to
vote a serious resolution as early
as tomorrow. We're working

tively protect civilians and
increase the pressure on the
Gadhafi regime to halt the kill-
ing and to allow the Libyan
people to express themselves in
their aspirations for the future

"Those include discussion of a
no-fly zone, but the U.S. view is
that ... a no-fly zone has inherent
limitations in terms of protec-
tion of civilians at immediate

the United States is discussing

Rescue teams
continue to search
for missing bodies
NATORI, Japan (AP) - Line
after line, a list on the wall of city
hail reveals the dead. Some are
named. Others are identified only
by a short description.
Female. About 50. Peanuts in
left chest pocket. Large mole.
Seiko watch.
Male. 70-80 years old. Wear-
ing an apron that says "Renta-
com."
One set catches the eye of
Hideki Kano, a man who appears
to be in his 30s.
"I think that's my mom!" he
says. He rushes out into the snow,
headed for a makeshift morgue.
The list in Natori, and others
along Japan's northeast coast,
will only get longer.
Five days after the 9.0-mag-
nitude earthquake and tsunami,
the official death toll is more than
4,300. More than 8,000 people
are still missing, and hundreds of
national and international rescue
teams are looking for them.
In the industrial town of

Kamaishi, 70 British firefighters
in bright orange uniforms clam-
ber over piles of upturned cars to
search a narrow row of pulver-
ized homes. They wear personal
radiation detectors amid fears
of leaks from damaged nuclear
plantsfar to the south.
One woman's body is found
wedged beneath a refrigerator in
a two-story home pushed onto its
side.
"Today and tomorrow there
is still hope that we will find
survivors," says Pete Stevenson,
head of the British rescue crews.
"We'll just keep on carrying out
the searches."
Those seeking loved ones have
posted hopeful notes in tempo-
rary shelters and other public
places. They cover the front win-
dows of Natori City Hall, block-
ing the view inside:
"I'm looking for an old man, 75
years old, please call if you find
him."
"Kento Shibayama is in the
health center in front of the pub-
lic gym."
"To Miyuki Nakayama: Every-
one in your family is OK! We can't
use our mobile phones, so you
can't call us, but we're all here. If

you can come home, please come!
We're praying for you."
City officials have posted a list
of 5,000 people staying at shel-
ters. Yu Sato, 28, snapped photos
of the names.
I'll post them on the Inter-
net so people living far away can
check," he says.
In Otsuchi town, Reiko Miura
conducts her own search.
She's looking for a 50-year-
old nephew who couldn't flee the
tsunami because of a work injury
that had phyiscally disabled him.
His mother - Miura's sister -
asked her to look for her son.
But for the 68-year-old
woman, it is a struggle just to rec-
ognize the neighborhood, now a
sea of mud punctuated by tossed
cars and mounds of debris.
"I'm pretty sure that my family
home is here. It was a big house,"
she says upon reaching a pile
of rubble in a location that feels
familiar. But there's no sign of
her nephew, and she trudges back
across the mud, unsure what to
tell her sister.
The devastation is of such
magnitude that it is hard to imag-
ine some of the communities ever
being rebuilt.

Surveillance helps
authorities spy on

U.S. Customs and Border Pro-

flying Predator drones into Mex-

drug traffickers, The Associated
Press has learned.
The border security agency's
surveillance flights, approved
by Mexico but never announced
by either country, predate occa-
sional flights into Mexico by
the U.S. Air Force's $38 million
Global Hawk drone that began
last month.
Mexico's National Security
Council said in a statement yes-
terday that unmanned aircraft
have flown over Mexico on spe-
cific occasions, mainly along the
border with the U.S., to gather

information at the request of the
Mexican government.
The flights expand the U.S.
role in the drug war, in which
Americans already have been
training Mexican soldiers and
police as well as cooperating on
other intelligence.

But once the renovations are
completed, current residents of
Northwood I, II and III won't
be able to move back into their

paper in Angell Hall and the
Michigan Union, but he hopes
that distribution will expand to
more locations across campus
like Pierpont Commons for the
duration of the trial.
The program will continue
until the end of MSA elections,
which are scheduled to be held
on March 23 and 24.
Summers, an Engineering
sophomore, said the current
number of distributed copies
is much smaller than what the
actual distribution proposes
- about 3,000 to 4,500 copies
of the paper Monday through
Friday. To cover the cost of
the paper, students would be
charged no more than $4 each

semester.
According to Summers, MSA
is currently "cooperating with
the trial as a wayto gain student
feedback," but has not yet taken
a stance on the program.
"I thought that a ballot ques-
tion would be the best way to
evaluate student interest in gen-
eral," Summers said. "I could
have brought forth an additional
resolution to seek endorsement
from (MSA) regarding the pro-
gram, but currently, we're really
interested in just what students
think."
Kevin Cappallo, the national
director of education sales for
The New York Times, wrote
in an e-mail interview that
the newspaper has established
programs on more than 1,200
college campuses nationwide.
More than 400 schools are
involved in the College Reader-
ship Program specifically.
"The fundamental purpose
of our college program is to
support the thousands of fac-
ulty members across the broad
spectrum of curriculum that

"spending aslot of hours dealing
with other cases," Brown said.
Rewards are being offered for
information pertaining to these
cases because they were crimes
against people, which are more
dangerous than crimes like lar-
ceny, Brownsaid. She added that
the rewards are being offered
because DPS believes there are
people who have more informa-
tion about the incidents.
Brown said rewards are
typically offered based on the
"investigator's instinct that
there are people out there with
additional information" who
would respond if there is a mon-
etary incentive. DPS has offered
rewards in the past, but it isn't
a common procedure because
many cases the department
encounters already have sus-
pects or it's the type of crime
in which the perpetrator is not
typically found, she added.
The last time DPS offered a
reward for a crime was on Oct.
31, 2009, when the department
offered $250 for information
leading to an arrest after a man
was assaulted by up to 10 men
while he was driving on Elm
and V after April 2012.
Several students at Tuesday's
meeting expressed concerns
with their possible relocation to
Northwood IV orV apartments,
with most of the apprehensions
relating to the apartments
being catered to families, more
expensive and less accessible to
University buses than the other
apartment buildings.
"Northwood IV and V are
much more like family-oriented
houses, with different rooms
inside, so that might also cause
problems because ... many peo-
ple who want to live with one
bedroom won't be able to find
one because most of the facili-
ties...are townhouses," one
Northwood resident, who will
be affected by the relocation,
said during the meeting.
For 2010-2011, an unfur-
nished one-bedroom apart-
ment costs $896 in Northwood
I, between $767 and $837 in
Northwood II and $896 or $950
with air conditioning in North-
wood IV and V, according to the
University Housing website.
An unfurnished two-bedroom
apartment in Northwood I
costs $1,004 per month, $968
in Northwood II and $1,086 or
use The New York Times as a
supplement to their required or
recommended readings in their
courses," Cappallo wrote. "Tra-
ditionally, copies of The Times
have been offered to both fac-
ulty and students at special edu-
cation rates to support faculty
utilization of the newspaper in
their coursework."
Representatives from USA
Today also talked to MSA at an
assembly meeting before spring
break about establishing a simi-
lar program on campus. Accord-
ing to Summers, the assembly
ultimately decided not to work
with the publication.
"The general consensus, at
least among the representatives,
was that we weren't interested
specifically in (USA Today),"
Summers said.

Summers said he believes The
New York Times will appeal
more.to the student body. On
Monday, Summers said the
majority of the papers were off
the racks by about 4:30 p.m.
"If students support it over-
whelmingly, if there's at least
a majority of support - and
hopefully we'll see if there's
a supermajority - then we'll
move from there," he said.
LSA senior Elizabeth Hat-
field said she would appreciate
another news source on campus
and is in favor of the program.
"I think the availability of
the news is really important ... I
enjoy reading newspapers, I like
to read (them) more so than on
the Internet," Hatfield said.
Cappallo wrote that other
campuses that participate in
The New York Times College
Readership Program, such as
Pennsylvania State University
and the Ohio State University,
have seen positive results.
"Many college educators
believe a quality newspaper can
play a vital role in keeping stu-

archives.
The incident occurred dur-
ing the annual Elm Street block
party on Halloween. A man
attempting to drive down the
crowded street was dragged
from his vehicle and beaten to
the point that he needed treat-
ment from a hospital.
According to the DPS
archives, a $1,000 reward
was also offered for informa-
tion leading to the arrest of
the person involved with the
arson at West Quad Residence
Hall on March 26, 2009. The
arson was later linked to then-
LSA senior Timothy Burke,
who said his target was former
Michigan football player Justin

planned fell through.

University Housing is
addressing these concerns by
offering an individual adviser
to every student who wants to
stay, Logan said. The adviser
would help students find an
apartment similar in style and
rent to their current apart-
ments, he said.
During the meeting, some
students said they would have
been willing to stay in their
apartments and bear the distur-
bances of the three-month con-
struction updates rather than
abandon their apartments after
April 2012.
However, Logan said, let-
ting students remain in their
housing unit during a repair
period can be problematic. He
said that, in this case, it would
be especially inconvenient for
residents if they remained in
the building since work will be
done in every apartment.
"The experience was stu-
dents thought it very disruptive,
very unpleasant. It disturbs
study, it disturbs their day-to-
day routines," Logan said. " ...
There is dust, there is noise and
of course there is the intrusion
into the apartment space."
while stimulating conversation
and civic engagement," Cappal-
lo wrote. "They believe reading
a newspaper on a regular basis
contributes to the development
of critical thinking skills and
the practice of responsible citi-
zenship while helping students
connect classroom concepts to
everyday life."
The college programs aren't
just about a cost-effective
means of giving students access
to national newspapers, Cap-
pallo wrote.
"(The Times) offers these
campuses much more than just a
greatpriceonnewspapers,"Cap-
pallo wrote. "We offered several
scalable value-added benefits to
our participating campuses that
include free speaker events with
Times journalists, faculty work-

shops, student contests and
other special discounts on NY
Times services."
Engineering junior Megan
Kao said she thinks students
would respond well to having
more print newspapers on cam-
pus.
"I think it's a good idea
because there's probably a lot
of people that are not liking the
fact that newspapers are kind
of dying, and I think it's good
to have newspapers available,"
Kao said.
LSA senior Michael Powers
said he thinks the availability of
more national and global news
would complement the local
news already on campus.
"Obviously it lets you know
what's going on in the more
national and global scale, and I
think it would be a nice supple-
ment to The (Michigan) Daily,"
Powers said. "The Daily is great
for local issues, butI don't think
anybody reads the Daily for any
issue outside of campus or even
outside of the state. So I think
it would be a good initiative to
inform students."

PROTEST
From Page 1A
read "Reconsider Snyder" and
"Not in our house" on the steps
of the Harlan Hatcher Graduate
Library.
The event's speakers included
Goldsmith and LSA senior Rick
Durance, who created an online
petition against the choice of
Snyder. The petition has gar-
nered more than 4,239 signa-
tures as of 8 p.m.
Durance said in an interview
that he started the petition
because he wants the Univer-
sity to stop inviting politicians
to speak at commencement cer-
emonies.
"It's clear that having political
speakers, whether it's (President
Barack) Obama or Rick Snyder,
is dividing our graduating class,"
Durance said. "This is the time
where we should be University
of Michigan students first - not
Republicans, not Democrats, not
affiliated with any of our politi-
cal parties, but University of
Michigan students. I don't think
that Governor Snyder is facilitat-
ing that."
He added that he would have
protested Obama's commence-
ment speech last spring if the
president proposed cuts to edu-
cation like Snyder has.
Michigan's public universi-
ties face a 15-percent funding
reduction from the state if Sny-
der's 2012 fiscal year budget pro-
posal is carried through. Such
a decrease would mean $47.5
million less for the University,
which received $316 million
from the state for the 2011 fis-
cal year. Snyder's budget also
includes a provision that would
raise funding cuts to 20 percent
if state colleges increase in-state
students' tuition by more than 7.1
percent.
Durance said by inviting Sny-
der, the University is supporting
his policies "by de facto."
LSA senior Michael Caruso,
who participated in the rally
yesterday, said he was protest-
ing because Snyder's proposal to
cut funding for higher education
would undoubtedly raise tuition
and put a financial strain on stu-
dents.
"I'm working 60 hours per
week trying to pay my tuition
to attend this university, and it's
ridiculous that Mary Sue Cole-
man would think that it would
be the right thing to bring in a
man (to) speak who's trying to
bump my tuition up and make
me work harder when I'm trying
to work my ass off in class alone,"
Caruso said. "It's absurd to me
that she would think that's the
right thing to do."
University spokeswoman

Thursday, March 17, 201 - 3A
Kelly Cunningham declined to
comment on the protests, but
wrote in an e-mail that the Uni-
versity traditionally invites first-
term governors to be the Spring
Commencement speaker.
"The choice of commence-
ment speaker is very important
to the graduating class, their
family and friends attending the
ceremony, and we work to find
someone who will inspire oth-
ers through the commencement
address and by virtue of his or
her distinguished accomplish-
ments," Cunningham wrote.
"We are very pleased that Gov-
ernor Snyder, a three-time alum
of the University before age 23,
was able to accept the invitation
in his first term."
Durance said he plans to
attend the regents meeting
tomorrow to present the Board
with the petition. He said he
anticipates that "several dozen"
students will be joining him.
Goldsmith said he will also go
to the meeting, adding that he
plans to protest atthe commence-
ment ceremony on April 30.
"(University administrators)
wanta peaceful and orderly com-
mencement, and if Rick Snyder
is the commencement speaker,
it will be none of those things,"
Goldsmith said. "It is not going
to be peaceful nor is it going
to be orderly if he is the com-
mencement speaker. It's going to
be ugly, and it's not going to be
good."
LSA senior Michelle Shirk
joined the Diag protest, but said
she doesn't want any protests at
the actual commencement cer-
emony.
"I've heard about silent pro-
tests happening during gradu-
ation, where during his speech,
people want to stand up and turn
around. I don't support that,"
Shirk said. "I don't want my
graduation to turn into a politi-
cal event that. It's not about that.
It should be about me, and my
graduation and my graduating
class."
Though a majority of people
at the protest yesterday opposed
Snyder, there were a handful of
counter protesters who support
the governor.
Engineering senior Nick Clay,
who said he is a Republican,
expressed disappointment that
there was such outcry against
Snyder.
"We think that at a univer-
sity like Michigan, a public
university, there should be a
platform where we can accept a
lot of diverse views - that's what
Obana said last year," Clay said.
"... (There's) alot of uncivil rhet-
oric. Let's just tone it down, and
let's just have a nice graduation."

Practical parameters
'U' needs to implement trespass policy changes
The University took steps last Friday to alter what is a
well-intentioned - if overzealous - trespass policy. As it
stands, the policy gives campus police too much authority
and is in need of revision. Most of the changes that the University
plans to implement to modify the trespass policy would be benefi-
cial and should be considered to ensure the reasonable safety of

9

the campus community.
After the University banned former Mich-
igan assistant attorney general Andrew
Shirvell from campus, the American Civil Lib-
erties Union of Michigan brought longstand-
ing concerns with the policy to the fore by
sending a letter to University President Mary
Sue Coleman and University Department of
Public Safety Executive Director Ken Magee.
In response to the letter, Suellyn Scarnecchia,
the vice president and general counsel of the
University, proposed a plan to alter the tres-
pass policy. The plan decreases the wide scope
of the current rules and adjusts the regula-
tions to a more appropriate level. According
to a March 13 Michigan Daily article, when
individuals refuse to adhere to the University
rules, their violation provides grounds for a
trespass warning to be issued. Rather than
maintaining this sweeping clause, Scarnec-
chia wants to, and should, change the policy
so that individuals can only be issued a warn-
ing when they break rules that "protect the
health, safety and welfare of the University's
community members and property."
Scarnecchia also wants the University to
have more oversight when a trespass warn-
ing has been issued. For example, DPS officers
would inform their supervisors of trespass
warnings they have issued. It's alarming that
any DPS officer is capable of banning a person
from campus, and it would be imprudent to
implement a new policy without stripping this
power from DPS officers.
There needs to be an improved appeals
and review process, which the DPS Oversight

Committee - composed of students, faculty
and staff - could manage. Scarnecchia wants
to expedite the appeal review process so that
all appeals will be decided within 40 days of
their filing. Appeals shouldn't take this long to
review, but this is a reasonable time limit for
more complex matters.
There's currently no time limit on trespass
warnings, and 2,000 individuals have been
banned from University's campus over the
past decade. The new policy would include
the option to institute time limits on bans if
applicable to the circumstances. This is an
important change: Automatic lifelong bans are
far too drastic for minor infractions. Even if
there's no time limit on a ban, there should at
least be a set date when a review should take
place, as all orders should be reviewed from
after the incident to make sure they are still
warranted.
In addition to tightening the parameters
for trespass violations, Scarnecchia wants
to change the policy so that bans apply to all
three University campuses. While this may
be necessary in some cases, a mandatory ban
on all campuses is excessive. It's important
that the new policy allows this option, but it
shouldn't be the standard.
Most of Scarnecchia's proposals include
changes the University's trespass policy needs
to undergo. The parameters should be practi-
cal and reflective of the individual's offense.
It's important that the University continues to
acknowledge the flaws in its policy and makes
the appropriate revisions.

ichigan Daily columns
can't surpass 750 words.
Because of this require-
ment, I typically
have to over-gen-
eralize certain
aspects of my
opinion in order
to avoid detract-
ing from the
column's central
focus. There sim-
ply isn't enough JEREMY
space to include LEVY
all the back-
ground informa-
tion that informs my opinion, and
sometimes, the lack of space can
even provide a useful opportunity to
whitewash over areas in which I'm
less knowledgeable.
Such is the nature of any short
paper, television interview, public
speech or lecture, and I am telling
you this because my own need to
manage a small writing space has
made me more aware of the ways
that professional writers have to
employ the same strategies. It's a
given societal virtue that to be con-
sidered an informed person, you
have to read the news. But there
seems to be less attention given to
how people read the news, and as
college students learning to think
critically, it's important for us to
think about the ways that authors
convey information in order to make
their arguments.
-Which brings me to Paul Krug-
man. Krugman is a Nobel Prize
winning economist who teaches at
Princeton University, has written
many books and writes columns in
The New York Times twice a week.
He often seems to be the most prom-
inent advocate of liberal economics.
He's obviously a smart man, and I
find his columns very informative.

But his word is too often treated as
gospel, and I think we can all pay
more attention to what he chooses to
include and not include in his 800-
word space.
After following Krugman's col-
umns semi-regularly, I've struggled
trying to figure out why he seemed
to be one of few public voices that
didn't express concern over the fed-
eral deficit. Column after column,
he argued that current economic
recovery was slow, and the debt
wasn't nearly as worrisome as the
prospect of sinking back into reces-
sion. This is exactly what happened
prior to World War II, he argues in
his book "Deficit Economics," when
then-President Franklin Roosevelt
tried to balance the budget once the
economy showed signs of recovery.
The argument is certainly rea-
sonable. But how do you reconcile it
with sources elsewhere predicting
an iminent currency crisis analo-
gous to what happened in Greece
this past summer?
Part of the answer lies in the fact
that the most vocal trumpeters of
anti-deficit rhetoric are election-
oriented politicians. It often feels
like the majority of space in the aver-
age Krugman column tracks the
exploits of such politicians, blames
both parties with the caveat that
the Republicans are worse and the
economic analysis slips through the
crack But is that all there is to the
conersation? Is there no legitimate
fear'b ift thfiecurrent deficit?
For Krtiugman, the answer in terms
of the short-term deficit is, actually,
no. But the concrete answer as to why
is hard to pinpoint. Take for example
a recent column, "Dumbing Deficits
Down," in which the entire explana-
tion regarding short-term deficits
was a few sentences: "The nation is
not, in fact,'broke.' The federal gov-

ernment is having no trouble raising
money, and the price of that money
- the interest rate on federal bor-
rowing - is very low by historical
standards." As a non-economist, I'm
inclined to ask, what makes interest
rates the standard for determining
whether ashort-termdeficitis aprob-
lem? Unfortunately, further explana-
tion would take up too much space.
Students should
be critical of what
isn't written.
I'm not saying that Krugman isn't
a brilliant professor who passionate-
ly believes what he's arguing. I just
think it's too easy to fall into a trap
of thinking, "I don't understand the
economics, but the political analysis
is astute. He won a Nobel Prize, and
he hates Republicans. Sounds good."
Admittedly, I'm coming before
you in this piece not as a confident
columnist, but as a confused student.
I simply hope that by taking you
through my thought process, we can
start a broader conversation, not on
my economic ignorance - since I'm
sure the average reader isn't much
better - but on how we analyze
persuasive pieces. We shouldn't let
slide analysis we don't"understand,
and we need to not only be critical of
what's written, but also what's omit-
ted. There's probably no better time
than now to think about how authors
choose to use their 700 to 800-word
space. We are students, after all.

This page has been filled recently with
viewpoints and columns discussing the future
of Detroit, Ann Arbor's neighboring big city.
Detroit is no stranger to the aftermath of the
recent financial crisis. Cities across the nation
felt the impact as the economy slid further
and further into disrepair. The financial crisis
we have been in since 2007 is finally starting
to turn around, and the economy will slowly
rebuild itself. But what is the best way to
prevent something like this from happening
again? It's not more regulation on banks from
the government - financial institutions will
always find ways to get around these laws.
It's education of our citizens that will prevent
people from being taken advantage of and will
hopefully increase everyone's financial health.
Since I have been at the University, I've
become involved with a finance and invest-
ing club that focuses on just that. Michigan
Interactive Investments is the most promi-
nent student-run investment club at the Ross
School of Business. The 2010-2011 school year
marks the 13th year of MII as a student-run
investment club. The club focuses on educat-
ing its members on a variety of topics, includ-
ing stocks, bonds, derivatives and alternative
investments. Each meeting includes an edu-
cation component taught by an experienced
member as well as an investment pitch, and
additional weekend workshops are set up
for members to attend. Every year, the club
builds a portfolio of investments in order to
educate members through active real world
investing. Members are assigned to a group
of five or six students, and these groups select
and research stocks that will be held in the
club's portfolio.
In 2009, MII decided to expand its invest-
ment education goal to colleges and universi-
ties across the country. That March, they held
their first Undergraduate Investment Confer-
ence with the intention of showcasing under-
graduate students' investment skills as well

as giving them an opportunity to learn from
industry professionals. In its inaugural year,
the UIC brought in students from 17 top uni-
versities to take part in panel discussions and
investment presentations. At the core of UIC is
the Stock Pitch Competition. Each participat-
ing schoolforms a team of two to four students,
who then research and pitch a stock to a panel
of industry judges. Students gain real world
experience and get a feel for what it would be
like to do the same sort of research and work
within the financial services industry.
Participants are also given the opportunity
to hear leading industry experts talk about
their experiences. Past keynote speakers have
included Michael Gelband of Millennium
Management and David Richter, managing
director of Investments for Grosvenor Capital
Management. In past years, Forbes magazine
and Morningstar have published media cover-
age of the UIC.
Based on past success, the 2011 UIC has
expanded participation to 24 schools, includ-
ing the Wharton School at the University of
Pennsylvania, University of California Berke-
ley and Cornell University. A keynote speech
will be delivered by Marc Lasry of Avenue
Capital Group at 5 p.m. on Friday, March 18.
The final round of the competition will fea-
ture the four teams who will compete for the
$3,000 grand prize on Saturday, March 19 at 3
p.m. Both events will be held in Blau Audito-
rium of the Ross School of Business.
In a time when financial health is more
important than ever, MiI is trying to educate
not only its own members, but students from
universities across the nation. All students
from any major at the University are welcome
to attend, as well as faculty staff members and
Ann Arbor residents. For more information,

Who would have thought that agovernor elected with
such a mandate to revitalize our state and keep young
people in Michigan would become a focal point for stu-
dent anger when he was named the University's Spring
2011 Commencement speaker earlier this week? Why
would students be so upset at the idea of such a promi-
nent and successful University alum coming to address
our graduating seniors? We believe that such anger at
the simple decision to invite the governor of Michigan
to commencement is uncalled for and unbecoming of an
open-minded University where differing thoughts and
viewpoints can be expressed and exchanged freely.
Many of those who are unhappy with the pick oppose
Republican Gov. Rick Snyder's selection on the basis
that Snyder has proposed cutting state funding to our
own University. But this is truly nothing new. The Uni-
versity's website explains that higher education fund-
ing has been cut by every administration since the
1960s. Over the last nine years - Democratic Gov. len-
nifer Granholm's two terms as governor - state fund-
ing declined by 13 percent. Snyder's proposed cut of 15
percent is comparable and fair given the current fiscal
realities that our state is facing. Some hold the addition-
al misconception that the state money the University
receives sustains it and constitutes a source of funding
we couldn't survive without. But in reality, Snyder's pro-
posed cut of 15 percent in current state funding to the
University is much smaller than it sounds. Because state
support makes up only 20 percent of the University's
general fund - and the general fund makes up just 27.8
percent of the University's total budget - in reality, the
proposed cut is less than 1 percent (0.834 percent to be
exact) of the University's overall budget. Our University
has done well and can continue to flourish without rely-
ing on this state funding. This cut can be managed. And
it will have to be.
Anyone who is willing to take an honest look at our
state's budget will see that Michigan simply cannot
continue spending at the current levels. The politically
expedient path taken by Snyder's predecessor was to
back down from tough spending cuts for fear of losing
political support. Snyder inherited a real structural
deficit that cannot be repaired without far-reaching

structural changes. Luckily for us, he has risen to the
challenge of proposing long-term solutions and has the
courage to move forward, even with the knowledge that
his ideas will make him no friends. People can complain
all they want, but we have already seen that the alterna-
tive - taxing the same, shrinking tax base and driving
real jobs away from our state - hasn't worked.
What's more, invitingnewly elected governors - both
Republicans and Democrats alike - to address gradu-
ates at commencement is a longstanding University
tradition, going all the way back to Republican Gov. Wil-
liam Milliken in the 1980s. Those who wish to protest
the decision would be well served to place personal poli-
tics aside, as many conservatives on campus did last year
with President Barack Obama as the commencement
speaker. Where was all the hype and hysteria then?
In spite of some students' irresponsible and immature
protest over petty political differences with Snyder, it's
highly unlikely that the University's Board of Regents
will make any decision other than to approve Snyder
as speaker at their meeting today. He is our governor,
whether the students at the University like it or not, and
has taken on the task of making hard choices to protect
our state's financial and economic future. He should be
applauded for having the guts to make such unpopular
but necessary decisions. Snyder doesn't deserve to be
maligned or ridiculed on Facebook with crudely pho-
toshopped red X's through his face. Such petty and
degrading behavior from University students shows a
lack of class and a lack of respect for an alum holding
three degrees from the University - a loyal alum who
is seen courtside at basketball games, who is a resident
of Ann Arbor and who has sacrificed opportunities in
the private sector to serve us as governor. Whether you
agree with his policies or not, Snyder has shown true
leadership and achieved success both in politics and in
the private sector. Let's not harangue him for that suc-
cess, but instead recognize it, respect it and celebrate it
this spring at commencement.

Regional Breakdowns: Who are this year's Cinderellas?

SOUTHWEST: The top half of
this bracket is pretty cut and dry.
Even President Barack Obama
picked Kansas to win it all, and
the Jayhawks should be able to
tear through their first three
games. But Purdue or Notre
Dame could pose a problem in the
regional semifinals.
The possible matchup between
the Fighting Irish and the Boiler-
makers could prove to be one of
the most exciting of the tourna-
ment. Purdue'spost/guard combo
of E'Twaun Moore and JaJuan

Johnson, who combine for 39
points and 13 rebounds a game,
may meet its match in Notre
Dame's Ben Hansbrough and
Tim Abromaitis, who combine for
34 points and10 rebounds a game.
The most likely upset is No. 12
Richmond over No. 5 Vanderbilt.
The Spiders just finished their
regular season with a record-
setting 27 wins, including wins
over then-No.8 Purdue and Saint
Joseph's. Richmond is on a seven-
game win streak, led by seniors
Kevin Anderson and Justin Harp-

er. Last weekend, the Spiders won
their first-ever Atlantic-10 title
and are looking to make a mark
in their second-straight NCAA
Tournament appearance.
Florida State - with nine
upperclassmen - could also make
some noise.
It held Ohio State to its lowest
point total of the year and handed
Duke one of its four losses this
season when senior guard Der-

rebounds.

ated Kawhi Leonard - who was

er who didn't previously have the
Wolverines on his radar sees the
message and bumps up his inter-
est.
Additionally, the NCAA con-
siders a "direct message" at a
recruit - along with Facebook
messages - an ordinary e-mail.
Since plenty of high school kids
now check their social media
pages much more often than
es. The their e-mail, posting on Twitter
increases the likelihood that they
will take notice, and that they'll
respond more rapidly.
It's happened fast, too.
Smotrycz is just a freshman, and
he committed to Michigan late
in his junior year of high school.
But even then, Smotrycz said he
really didn't engage Twitter at all
during his recruitment process.
Now, countless potential players
e TEAM are on the application.
"Kids like to type more than
they like to talk these days,"
Jordan said. "(Twitter) allows
recruits and parents to keep
up with the program - follow
ou on updates with scores and games
- and individuals on the team as
well. It's kind of a double-edged
sword, but if you use it the way

it's meant to be used, it's a good
thing."
But the same risks current
NCAA players face are there for
recruits as well - long before
they even make it to college.
Player safety is even more of
a concern, since most recruits
on Twitter are under the age of
18. Where college athletes have
received plenty of education and
coaching in dealing with people
attacking them on the Internet, a
high school student has received
considerably less guidance, if any
at all. And, obviously, Internet
abuse can be much more harm-
ful to those in high school than
those in college, who are legally
adults and more mature than
their younger counterparts.
And the potential conse-
quences of an athlete slipping
up on Twitter are much more
significant for a recruit than a
college player. Harrellson had
his account suspended and was
forced to do extra running; ESPN.
com national recruiting analyst
Dave Telep has seen high school
players actuallylose scholarships
as a result of ill-advised Twitter
posts they've written.
"Some of what I've seen on
Twitter, it's just unacceptable,"
Telep said. "We don't have any
rules for this right now, so kids
are going to have to learn the
hard way. I know I've contacted a
couple kids who I know are really
good kids (and said) 'Everybody's
reading this, this is not the kind
of thing you want to have your
name attached to.'
"I think we have to educate
our kids about it, so they know
how to properly use it. It's a pub-
lic forum."
Telep doesn't necessarily see
Twitter as an ideal new method
for coaches to contact recruits,
though such communication
does happen often.
Instead, he sees it as an effec-
tive way for coaches to evalu-
ate recruits, based on what they
choose to post.
The process works both ways:
While recruits learn about Mich-
igan through general updates
from coaches and specific con-
tact from a staff member, the
Wolverines can assess character
- a critical part of evaluation,
especially in Beilein's philoso-
phy.
"College basketball coaches
are like spies on Twitter," Telep
said. "They figure they read
everything a kid says, and try to
gain an insight and advantage
into what he's thinking... (coach-
es) put on their CIA and FBI hats,
and that's how they use Twitter."
A dark cloud, though, could be
brewing on the recruiting hori-
zon. NCAA rules generally pro-
hibit contact between recruits
and fans, students and boost-
ers, as it essentially constitutes
illegal recruiting undertaken by
non-staff members.
But with Twitter and Face-
book, anyone has access to
recruits. Any fan of any program
- or even someone posing as a
fan of a different team - can send
messages that recruits can't nec-
essarily filter. It all constitutes
illegal contact and could mean a
boatload of vagaries and enforce-
ment problems for the NCAA as
Twitter continues to grow.
With the surge in text messag-
ing in the last decade, the NCAA

had to quickly adapt an make
new rules surrounding caches'
use of texting to talk to recruits.
The same may have to I,.:ppen
soon with new media.
"I don't know how mu Nthe
NCAA can police this stuff,"
Telep said. "This is the we ld we
live in. This is life. Twitter Face-
book, social media, it's wh at kids
do nowadays. I don't kno how
the NCAA can be responsible for
policing every single thing on
Twitter.
"At the same time, you don't
want to accept it. What's the
right answer to this? I don' think
anybody knows."
Moving Forward
It is impossible to predi t how
college basketball and new nedia
will interact in the future After
all, who could have pre licted
Facebook and Twitter would
become the cultural behi soths
they are now?
The one thing Beilein knows:
He and his program have to keep
up with it all.
"It's really important fc us to
(not) say, 'Oh, we're not ging to
go there,' or 'I'm not goin, to do
e-mail,' or 'I'm not going to' -
you have to do it," Beilein said.
"You have to delegate it wd11, and
you have to manage it very well."
Otherwise, Michigan m ay fall
behind in a rapidly changi g col-
lege basketball landscape.
Telep warns that it could
do "more harm than good" if a
coach goes out of his c:mfort
zone in trying to adapt to social
media. One would think tE the's

Twitter regularly, let alon even
know its ins and outs.
And perhaps Beilein truly
doesn't know a lot about But
he's successfully adapte: and
more importantly, just as he said,
he has delegated effectively.
He quickly realized his assis-
tants had great potentia with
the newer, ever-more-important
forms of media, and Beile n has
essentially given them free reign
to build interest in Michig .
So far, they've done s very
successfully - probably netter
than most other college basket-
ball programs - and they've
done it all within the rules.
But as innocent as they may
appear now, Twitter and other
new media forms will clay a
critical role in the future I col-
lege basketball and, inde d, all
sports. Beilein, Telep, Alexander
and others have said they re not
sure where it's all headed - and
nobody can really know fo ,ure.
"I (heard) recently or. NPR
that our body's wired to hve 150

said. "Back in the day, bacd in the
caveman day, you maybe had 50

ent villages.

It's time to own the spotlight, Coach

A the shades of gray in
the Michigan sky become
brighter tones of blue,
John Beilein walks the streets of
Ann Arbor with an extra bounce
in his step.
The Michigan coach has
defied all
expectations LUKE
this year, PASCH
leading one
of the young- On Basketball
est teams in
America to a
fourth-place finish in the mighty
Big Ten and a No. 8 seed in the
NCAA Tournament. No matter
what happens Friday against
No. 9 seed Tennessee - win or
lose - Beilein and his assistant
coaches should be proud of what
they've accomplished.
But I have four words of
advice for the fourth-year coach:
Don't screw this up.
As tempting as it may be, the
stage is too big and the spotlight

is too bright for complacency. All
eyes are on Beilein's Wolverines.
And for a coach who talks an
awful lot about building Michi-
gan into a perennial Division-I
powerhouse, winning Friday's.
contest would be a crucial step.
That's not to say that Beilein
hasn't been here with Michigan
once before.
The University's upperclass-
men fondly recall his run to
the tournament in 2009, when
Manny Harris and DeShawn
Sims led the team to a first-
round upset over Clemson
before being sent home by No.
2 seed Oklahoma (a game that's
mostly remembered for Blake
Griffin's posterizing dunk over
fun-sized forward Zack Novak).
But that was hardly Beilein's
crew - most of the players were
not his recruits.
And we all know how the fol-
lowing year panned out, practi-
cally erasing any progress the

tournament run made for the
program.
This year, Beilein has an
opportunity to show the world
what he can do with the first
Wolverine team made up entire-
ly of his recruits.
And you better believe that
up-and-coming high school and
AAU basketball stars in the state
of Michigan will be watching
closely.
On the heels of a season
sweep of Michigan State, poten-
tial top recruits are confused.
Do they go play for Spartan
coach Tom Izzo, who's proven
time 4d time again that he wins
in thepostseason? Or, do they
play for Beilein, who's coaching
a team with a decidedly bright
future?
Who knows. I'm not taking
any shots in the dark. But I do
know this - potential recruits
will be watching what happens
this weekend.

And at the very least, their
interest has been piqued by Sun-
day's airing of "The Fab Five,"
- now ESPN's highest-rated
documentary - which detailed
the glory days of Michigan bas-
ketball in the early 1990s (to
whomever decided to televise
the film a week before the NCAA
Tournament - kudos).
If Michigan can bounce a
Tennessee squad that's making
it's sixth-straight Tournament
appearance, likely earning a
Sunday showdown with top-
seeded Duke in the following
round (sorry, Hampton fans),
don't be surprised if you start
hearing whispers of maize and
blue on the recruiting landscape.
So, be happy, Beilein - you
deserve it. You've given hope to
fans who have endured one of
the worst stretches in the his-
tory of Michigan sports.

Russell eyes national title with high expectations

By DANIEL WASSERMAN
Daily Sports Writer
He just capped off his third con-
secutive Big Ten title.
He hadn't lost in 34 matches. Yet
none of that seemed to matter for
redshirt junior Kellen Russell.
"It's a good warm-up getting
ready for Nationals," Russell said
after winning his third conference
crown two weeks ago. "I'm just
kind of concentrating on winning
my first national title, and not the
three titles.
"I'm glad I was able to win
three. I know there a lot of really
good wrestlers that haven't been
able to do that, but I'm just trying
to concentrate on winning my-first
national title rather than thinking
about my three Big Ten titles right
now, because my real, long-term

goal isto win at Nationals."
And when you look at Russell's
career, you can't blame him.. The
High Bridge, New Jersey native is
one of eight wrestlers representing
11th-ranked Michigan (5-3 Big Ten,
11-5 overall) in this week's NCAA
Tournament, which begins Thurs-
day in Philadelphia. Russell, No. 1
in the 141-pound weight class, has
been in this spot before. In 2009.
- his sophomore season - Russell
was also the top-ranked grappler
entering the NCAA Tournament.
With the expectations of winning
a national title on his shoulders,
Russell crumbled - failing to even
reach the quarterfinals.
He lost again in the consolation
bracket, before capturing seventh-
place. That was 2009 - the last
time Russelllost.
"Throughout the course of the

season, he's done a good job of
staying focused week-to-week,"
Michigan coach Joe McFarland
said of his star's perfect season.
"But there's no question intheback
of his mind, this is what he wants.
This is the tournamenthe's trained
for. This is the tournament he's
been looking to get back to since
his sophomore year." But Russell
isn't the only Wolverine with high
expectations.
"We've been really intense and I
think the team looks really good,"
junior Zac Stevens said. "We're
rested and ready to go for the big
show.
"We sat down (with the coaches
at the beginning of the season) and
set what our goals for the season
are. I think everyone in our lineup
is capable of, and wantsto be, an
All-American. It's a pretty clear

thing across the board."
All-American honors are
bestowed upon those who finish in
the top eight at Nationals. Stevens
joins Russell, redshirt junior Justin
Zeerip and fifth-year senior Antho-
ny Biondo as the lone Wolverines
with NCAA Tournament experi-
ence. After struggling through a
season laced with injury, including
a diagnosis of colitis, Biondo knows
that with success in March, all can
be forgotten. After a 0-2 Big Ten
tournament put Biondo on thebub-
ble, the 15th-ranked veteran has a
chance to make a big splash in his
last go-around.
"I think he's excited to get
another opportunity," McFarland
said of his captain. "He's got expe-
rience here. I think he's in a good
spot - I like his draw. It's just a
matter of putting things together."

Four Wolverines - redshirt
sophomore Ben Apland, sopho-
more Sean Boyle and redshirt
freshmen Dan Yates and Eric Gra-
jales - will make their Nationals
debuts this week.
"Sometimes these guys come
in with big eyes because it's in a
big venue, it's sold out and they're
talking about a record attendance
here," McFarland said. "But I've
got .to keep these guys focused on
their wrestling and keeping the
distractions out of their mind.
"And we've talked about, 'It's
just another wrestling match.
You've done this hundreds and
hundreds of times throughout the
course of your life. It's just another
wrestling match."'
One thing the Wolverines have
going for them is their experience
going through the weekly grind of

the nation's toughest conference -
the Big Ten. Five of the country's
top-15 teams come from the Big
Ten - including three of the top
four.
"Wrestling in the Big Ten is kind
of like wrestling in the national
tournament all year long," Stevens '
said. "I think everybody will be
ready for the intensity and the level
of competitionbecause you're not
going to find better competition
than in the Big Ten."
But in the end, it all comes down
to representing their school and
the block 'M' on their chest.
"It means everything," Stevens
said of representing the Wolver-
ines. "That's what we're here for,
that's why we chose to come to
Michigan. We work all season for
it. This is just the culmination of
our season."

By MATT RUDNITSKY
Daily Sports Writer
The No.,5 Michigan softball
team (25-1) has already gotten
off to the best start in program
history, outscoring its oppo-
nents 191-33.
But it still NOTEBOOK
hasn't faced a
ranked opponent.
When the Wolverines travel
to Fullerton, Calif. to compete
at the Judi Garman Classic this
weekend, they'll finally get the
chance to prove whether they
belong at the top of the polls.
Michigan will face No. 6 Ari-
zona State on Friday and No. 7
Arizona on Saturday, as well as
Notre Dame and Fresno State
- two teams on the cusp of the
top 25 - on Sunday. The other
contest will come on Thursday
against Cal State Fullerton, the
Classic's host.
ARIZONA, WHO? Michi-
gan might be facing two top
opponents in Arizona and Ari-
zona State, but Michigan coach
Carol Hutchins isn't worried
about the tough competition.
"We just need to compete,"
Hutchins said. "It's not about
the other teams. We can't start
defining ourselves by who
we're playing. We haven't done
that yet, and if they start doing

it now, they can expect to have
a hard time. We just need to
play the game and enjoy com-
peting.
Still, she knows that this
weekend will be especially
tough.
"It's going to be good com-
petition, and I would think
(the players) would be excited
about it," Hutchins said.
WHO HAVE THEY BEATEN?
No. 6 Arizona State and No.
7 Arizona have each start-
ed their seasons with some
impressive wins.
The Sun Devils (24-1) are
currently riding a 20-game
winning streak and though
their competition has been
mostly pedestrian, they do
own a 4-3 win over No. 9 Okla-
homa.
They've been an offensive
juggernaut this season, scor-
ing 59 runs in five games last
weekend and reaching double-
digit runs in 14 of their last 18
games.
The Wildcats (21-4) lost two
of three games to No. 18 Bay-
lor last weekend, but No. 14
Nebraska, No. 22 Texas A&M
and No. 25 LSU.
If Michigan can survive of
this weekend unscathed, its
already-lofty ranking will con-
tinue to rise.

'M' takes on hot-streaking
Eastern Mich. in WNIT

the seniors likened it to climbing a
mile of stairs.
Though they didn't have to, most
of the team finished the hike by
sprinting back down. Maybe it was
the thin air, or maybe it was fatigue,
but Cobb said it seemed like a good
idea at the time.
The day ended with two full pool
practices.
"(We did it) at the end of the week
when they were really starting to
feel tired and worn out," Anderson
said. "I used to live there, soI knew
of (the Manitou Incline), and our
strength coach really encouraged
us to do it.
"The resounding comment from
all of them was that this was the
hardest thing they'd ever done, and
they liked it."
Three weeks later, Anderson's
plan appears to have worked. Prac-
tices seem tighter, and spirits seem
higher. Players look as if they are
playing through the end of each
practice with as much intensity as
they would a real game.
"It was a mental challenge and
a physical challenge," Cobb said.
"After the high altitude training, at
first we were a little tired, but we're
getting back to full strength.We feel
strong and confident going into the
next part of the season."
Senior Lauren Orth wants the
team to take the momentum all
the way to the NCAA Tournament,
where she and her fellow seniors
have made three consecutive
appearances. The three consecutive
first-round losses are still fresh on
her mind.
"Making it is always an accom-
plishment, but we want to do more
than just make it," Orth said. "We
want to place higher than we have
before and even try for the champi-
onship game.
"I want us to be the winningest
class that's everbeen at Michigan."

LECTURE PREVIEW
Lethem's 'utopia'

The Michigan Daily - michigandailylcom

THEATER PREVIEW

Famed author
Jonathan Lethem
speaks on campus
By TIMOTHY RABB
Daily Arts Writer

others, is no Jonathan

In Ann Arbor Helmut Stern
this week, Let- Auditorium
hem already Free
entertained
the University community with
a fiction reading on Monday, but
there's still time to take advan-
tage of a public reading today. In
a piece of narrative nonfiction
he shared with the University
community during his Monday
reading, he recounted his child-
hood exposure to nude models
in his father's art studio with
the clarity of his retrospective
intuition.
"Our house was very commu-
nal and arts-oriented," Lethem
said later in an interview with
The Michigan Daily. "It had a
nuclear family at the center, but
there was always a wide variety
of characters around."
Lethem's bohemian, late-
'60s upbringing in the Boerum
Hill neighborhood of Brooklyn
was a profound influence on his
writing career and the begin-
ning of a lifelong affinity' for
artistic communities like Ann

Arbor.
"I^haven't traveled much in
recent months, what with two
little kids and a permanent job,"
Lethem said. "But coming to a
town like Ann Arbor for a week-
long affair seemed a natural fit,
much better than the typical
one-day stop."
By "permanent job," Lethem
is referring to his prestigious
new position as Pomona's Roy
Edward Disney Professor of
Creative Writing, a post previ-
ously held by the late writer
David Foster Wallace. The pro-
fessorship is the culmination of
a 20-year writing career that
encompasses an eclectic array
of themes ranging from non-
fiction argumentative essays
to science fiction, with a Roll-
ing Stone feature on Bob Dylan
thrown in there somewhere
along the way.
"I originally planned to be an
artist like my father, but I was
talented in only the most boring
ways when it came to painting
and drawing," Lethem said. "I
saw a lot more potential in writ-
ing."
The structure and worldview
of Lethem's fiction is highly
autobiographical, informed
by the "collapsing utopia" he
observed during his counter-
cultural upbringing. But even
more relevant to his work are
his controversial views regard-
ing plagiarism.
In an argumentative essay
titled "The ecstasy of influence:
A plagiarism," Lethem argues
that every idea, no matter how
"pure" or "original" it may
seem, is derived from the work
of some predecessor.
"There are a few obvious

egregious behaviors that we can
all agree constitute plagiarism,"
Lethem said. "But those are the
far side of a very wide variety
of cultural participation that's
perfectly legitimate."
Lethem is unashamed when
it comes to walking his talk. As
a self-described "borrower" of
sorts, he finds a wealth of inspi-
ration in the writings of his
favorite science fiction author,
Philip K. Dick.
"My first two or three novels
were pretty much raw, shame-
less imitations of his style," Let-
hem said.
Even so, Lethem's writing
is a conglomeration of such a
wide variety of cultural influ-
ences that it can easily stand
by itself as unique and engag-
ing. Lethem stressed the point
that all artists - no matter
how celebtated they may be -
are human beings, limited by a
finite number of themes, words
and forms of expression. In his
mind, the key to being a good
writer is finding the proper bal-
ance with the resources avail-
able.

University playwrights will

embraces the development pro-

Like Davis's gold revelation, Myers

Sag Harbor, New York, she created

and "Hair," the audience cannot help
but notice and admire the costumes.
But for every three-person dress,
there are countless scenes in which
a T-shirt and jeans should say what-
ever a T-shirt and jeans can say, and
then move on.
For this reason, Myers stresses the

importance of costumes that look
authentic and wearable.
"I usually talk about them like
clothes, not costumes," she said.
"Regardless of period, in the world
we're creating, these are the clothes
they would wear. Even though we
never see it, there's a closet some-
where, a theoretical closet that this
was pulled from."
So when we see Amy's gold dress,
we don't just see a beautiful costume.
We see Amy's newfound wealth,
we see what success looks like for a
woman of that time period and we
see young Amy perhaps showing off
a little to her family. With one outfit,
we get an explanation of plot, his-
torical context and the character's
motive.
The process of designing "Little
Women" began last summer, when
Davis received and read the script. He
researched fashion from the 1860s,
compiling his findings in a book in
which he also drew his designs. Now,
he keeps the book at hand in the cos-
tume shop while he and his stitchers
fit costumes.
After researching, Davis spent
months gathering material and
accessories from stores in Royal Oak
and Chicago, finding suitable cos-
tumes from rental houses around the
country and organizing the items,
like petticoats and men's hats, that
the school already had in the cos-
tume shop.

"Art is less than half the job,"
Myers said, saying budget issues,
time frame limitations and the chal-
lenge of effective communication are
equally trying concerns.
In one of her first experiences
working with a cast for whom "acting
was their day job," the director cut a
dress she had "built," a first for her.
The production was a re-imagining
of "Oedipus," written and directed by
Dare Clubb, for the Blue Light The-
atre Company in New York.
"I had to leave the theater and
walk around the block," she said.
"The biggest lesson I learned was
that yes, I need to invest, but I have
to be able to let go."
It also helped that Frances McDor-
mand ("Fargo"), one of the actors
who was to wear the dress, liked the
garment so much she took it home.
Whether designing for a modern
show or a period piece like "Little
Women," costume designers use
the same principles to breathe life
into the world in the theater. In the
right hands, we can be as taken away
by a simple dress meant to fade into
the background - like the dress for
"Oedipus" - as by Amy's charmed
attire.
When asked what kind of show is
her favorite, Myers responded "the
one I'm working on."
But surely it doesn't hurt when
the audience gasps in awe when your
gold dress waltzes on stage.

Visuals and styling
are key for 'U' fashion
magazine Shei
By ARIELLE SPECINER
Daily Arts Writer
Magazines. We find them all around
us, whether in doctors' waiting rooms,
drugstore shelves and bookstores; we
can't help but browse through our favor-
ite semi-glossy pages and feel a tinge of
happiness. Though we may flip through a
magazine and enjoy looking at the photos
adorned with gorgeous models in equally
gorgeous clothing, we can't fully appre-
ciate a publication without an under-
standing of how much work and effort
goes into every detail of every page.
Magazines act as outlets to showcase
specific ideas to niche markets. And
while there are many different kinds of
magazines out there, fashion publica-
tions often seem to be on the forefront of
people's minds. This might be due to their
strong emphasis on visuals, driving and
presenting trends that we see every day
through editorial spreads and storylines.
"We are constantly surrounded by
fashion. We are constantly exposed
to inspiration," said LSA junior Grace
Grande-Cassell, fashion editor of the
University-published fashion magazine
Shei.
Though some believe fashion is highly
superficial, it's often taken for granted
that it's an art.
"It's actually very cultural," said LSA
sophomore Jess Linton, Shei's assistant
fashion editor.
According to Linton, magazines them-
selves are an accessible and relatable art
form to display and distribute the cre-
ativity of clothing.
"You can just pick one up. You don't
have to go to an art gallery or a showing,"
she said.
Though most of us don't have the avail-
ability to jet-set to major fashion capitals
like New York and Milan, magazines can,
in a way, allow us to sit front row at inter-
national Fashion Weeks alongside the
rich and famous.
What distinguishes fashion magazines
from other publications is their qual-
ity of pictorial content. More than any-
thing, the pictures in a fashion magazine
tell the story. Though written work is an
important component in any magazine,
the images are what make people want
to read it.
"Even if (an) article is really interest-
ing - it may be the best-written article
in the world, but if the graphic qual-
ity doesn't look up to par with that, then
nobody's going to want to read it," said
Architecture senior and Shei design edi-

tor Jackie Kow.
Fashion magazines have the ability to
pull together a number of diverse design-
ers and looks to create a cohesive spread
that can influence what we wear every-
day. As a visual culture, we are natu-
rally attracted to beautiful things, and
magazines, with all their perfectly posed
shots and fantasy settings, become the
aesthetically pleasing entity we strive to
emulate.
"Unlike photojournalism, you can't
shoot how it is," said Art & Design junior
Mai Truong, design director at Shei.
"With fashion, you create it yourself. It
takes time and effort."
Photography is what drives the fash-
ion business. A person flipping through
the pages of a beautiful magazine spread
who sees a dress, shirt or piece of jew-
elry that he or she likes might be more
inclined to buy that article of clothing, or
something from the same designer.
Fashion photography usually takes
into account two things: background
and design. Shei stages its photo shoots
in an assortment of places, ranging
from a white-walled studio to graffiti-
filled buildings in Detroit. But the most
important part of a fashion photo is
still the designs that it shows. Though
Shei doesn't have a huge fashion closet
available, as some of the major publica-
tions like Vogue and Elle do, it's OK - its
staffers make do with the local designers
and stores, like Bivouac, The Getup and
Poshh.
"We don't do a whole lot of avant-garde
pieces - you know, high-fashion things.
They're sort of more wearable with sort
of a couture flare," Grande-Cassell said.
According to Grande-Cassell, Shei
staff members
even use clothing
from their personal
closets for photo
shoots. This diver-
sifies the magazine
even further.
The literary edi-
tor of Shei, LSA
senior Bridget Bod- CLOSE TO U
nar, describes the NORTH CAD
magazine's look
as "do-it-yourself" AFFORDABLE
and youthful. Ann - ONSHUT'
Arbor has a good BUS ROU
mix of high and
low fashion with
stores like Poshh,
which carries
designer jeans and
dresses, to vintage
and consignment mich stuc
shops like Star Vin-
tage. The magazine housing
takes these two
types of fashion 7 .
and combines them

into a cohesive style that looks like a mil-
lion bucks - this is what we call the art of
fashion and styling.
Grande-Cassell understands that Ann
Arbor is not the conventional center for
fashion, but still feels the University is
worthy of a fashion publication.
"Obviously, we have people from all
over the world, and so they contribute to
a lot of different looks you see on cam-
pus," she said. "I think that Ann Arbor
is more artistically inclined than a lot of
places, so I think people are more accept-
ing as well."
But just a few striking photographs of
interesting looks and styling does not a
magazine make. Magazines need a back-
bone - and that's where layout comes
into play.
Accordingto most of the Sheistaff, the
layout of the magazine is just as impor-
tant as the photos it holds.
"Layout is like putting together a book
and telling a story," Kow said.
Like every shoot they contain, fashion
magazines have many different compo-
nents that have to come together to make
sense. Once all these pieces fit together,
a final product makes its way onto our
newsstands.
Though some people may believe it is
fickle and shallow, the fashion magazine
culture has large effects on our everyday
lives. The publication with pages of pho-
tos of gorgeous models clad in stunning
pieces of clothing is not just a tactile enti-
ty - it is a presentation of a lot of work,
effort and creativity.

Wen couture conflicts with context

Finding wardrobe and
accessory inspiration
from everything
By EMILY BOUDREAU
Daily Arts Writer
It all began, like so many things,
with a spring 2000 issue of Martha
Stewart Living. From that moment
on, I was hooked. The woman was a
wizard, and being about 11 years old
at the time, I was waiting on my Hog-
warts acceptance letter. Well, Mar-
tha was about as close as I was going
to get to actual magic. With only a
few household materials, a hot glue
gun and some cloth flowers, I could
whip up my own festive centerpiece,
napkin rings and personalized name
cards. Not that I had any need for
any of these things, but the impor-
tant thing (or so I thought) was that
I'd never have to go to Party Depot to
buy some cheap, horrible plastic nap-
kin rings.
Now, I'm not really artistic. I will
never be Martha, no matter what
color quilted jacket I wear or how
many paper flowers I fold. One time,
I tried to make my own candles and
ended up with burns and a pot filled
with molten brown wax. I have no
desire to spend my days making rus-
tic coat racks out of branches. How-
ever, there is something to be said for
actually making your own stuff - if
you want something done right, do it
yourself.

So much is mass-produced about
what we wear and the spaces we
spend our life in. Pretty much every-
body owns the same Michigan sweat-
shirt and that doesn't really have a
whole lot of personality. Now, I'm not
suggesting you go out and embroi-
der your own bedspread or produce
a calico dress with seed beading, but
it's always nice when there's some
kind of a personal touch to an outfit
or an apartment - some accessory or
an object that actually means some-
thing to someone, something that
was made with care and has a story
behind it.
Additionally, making your own
crap-you-don't-really-need is fun.
And cheap. And much easier than
you'd expect. The first step is prob-
ably the hardest: deciding what you
want to make and how you're going
to pull it off. There is a certain art to
figuring it out and your brain needs
to blend creativity with a certain
amount of mechanical savvy.
It's kind of like trying to change a
tire without an instruction manual.
Start looking at the way things are put
together. I make a lot of my own jew-
elry, and sometimes I will go into jew-
elry stores and just stare at necklaces.
Trust me. It's weird, but it works. It
also helps to think about what you
could do to make it better - would
you use a different color, a different
style of material, perhaps? This is
your project after all, so basically you
have the freedom to do anything.
Then, just start collecting stuff
like old ticket stubs and newspaper

clippings. I can'tguarantee you won't
end up on an episode of "Hoarders"
later in life, but you will get some
great craft projects out of it.
Craft stores are a dying breed,
so the Internet is another great
resource. Sure, there are generic
chain stores around like Michael's
and Home Depot, but I don't par-
ticularly find those stores inspiring.
Sometimes a craft project needs a
really good jumpstart, like that fan-
tastic collection of black-and-white
photographs you could find at a flea
market in Brussels and turn into your
own stationery. But since obviously
not everyone can go to Brussels, the
Internet is perfect. Everyone can
have access to weird materials. I
have a pile of typewriter keys I got off
eBay that I'm making into a bracelet.
Also, the Internet provides plenty of
crafts ideas. My personal favorite is
the blog P.S. I Made This. It has mil-
lions of ideas ranging from a DIY
Birkin-style tote bag to circle scarves
made out of the bottom half of an old
sweater and some carefully placed
double-sided tape.
Basically, there are plenty of ideas
out there and you just have to be
ready to tackle them. Occasionally,
you will have breakthrough moments
when all your hard work will finally
be worth it. Not all your projects
will turn out the way you want them
to, though. When I was 13, I walked
around in a bedazzled jean jacket.
You are goingto make mistakes - but
still, there's nothing quite like wear-
ing your own creations.

High fashion and
accessibility don't
have to be enemies
By JENNIFER XU
SeniorArts Editor
Here's a question that regularly
plagues the fashion world: Why aren't
models gracing the front covers of
Vogue anymore? Why have the edi-
torial spreads and September issues
been transplanted by the debatably less
attractive personalities of Hollywood?
How could the exalted New York Fash-
ion Week, a notoriously difficult event to
get into even with celebrity status, possi-
bly let, gasp, bloggers into its inner fold?
The chasm continues to grow between
fashion as curio and fashion as accessibil-
ity. Franca Sozzani, editor in chief of Ital-
ian Vogue, recently fired into the presses
that fashion bloggers don't have a real
foothold in the business - "they don't
offer an opinion but only talk about them-
selves, take their own pictures wearing
absurd outfits," she wrote (ironically) on
her own publication's blog. Antagonists
quickly responded that um, Franca, the
industry is changing whether you like
it or not, so get off your high horse, you
jealous hag. And so the battle wages,
blueblood against layman, Prada-wear-
ing-devil against Romy and Michele.
Some say fashion isn't art, at least not
when the clothes are hanging off our
pasty, love-handled frames. Couture
gowns by John "I love Hitler" Galliano
