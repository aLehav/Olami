When 
Rackham 
student 

Surojit Sural, Ph.D. candidate 
in molecular and integrative 
physiology, was deciding on 
leaving his home country 
of 
India 
for 
Japanese 

or 
American 
doctorate 

programs, 
he 
chose 
the 

University of Michigan for 
what he said was its prestige, 
location 
and 
financial 

support. 
His 
peers 
were 

accepted 
to 
high-ranking 

European universities, but 
also chose American schools 
due to their financial aid 
benefits.

However, 
under 
the 

Republican tax plan which 
recently passed the House, 
two of three student tax 
credits would be eliminated 
and tuition waivers Ph.D. 
candidates 
earn 
through 

teaching and research would 
become 
taxed. 
Supporters 

of the propsal argue the tax 
cuts will be beneficial for 
businesses, the middle class 
and economic growth, as tax 
cuts have been a major issue 
for the Republican party in 
recent weeks. 

While 
Sural 
plans 
to 

graduate in the summer of 
2018 and will not be affected 
if the bill goes through, he 
acknowledged 
how 
deal-

breaking this would have 
been for him had the bill 

When 
the 
parliament 

of Catalonia, a region in 
northeastern 
Spain, 
voted 

this past September to hold 
a 
region-wide 
referendum 

on whether or not Catalonia 
should become independent 
from Spanish governance, the 
question of its future became 
a 
matter 
of 
international 

importance.

Faced with such a divisive 

current 
event, 
professors 

instructing courses in the 
newly 
developed 
Catalan 

course 
sequence 
in 
the 

University 
of 
Michigan’s 

Department 
of 
Romance 

Languages and Literatures 
started to work discussion 
of the referendum into class 
time.

Susanna 
Coll-Ramirez, 

the 
assistant 
director 
to 

the 
Elementary 
Language 

Program 
in 
the 
Romance 

Languages 
Department, 

moved to the United States 
from Catalonia 18 years ago. 
She said in 2011 she was asked 
to develop a 400-level class 
in the Spanish curriculum 
on the Catalan language and 
culture.

After sufficient enrollment 

rates and positive student 
feedback, the class was given 
a permanent spot in the 
Spanish curriculum as a one-
semester course for students 

who have already taken three 
300-level 
Spanish 
courses. 

From there, another section 
was added and the sequence 
continued to grow until the 
Catalan courses became their 
own 
sequence, 
no 
longer 

strictly Spanish classes but 
instead cross-listed.

“Now 
it’s 
not 
under 

(Spanish) anymore, it’s also 
Catalan so it has its own 
name,” 
Coll-Ramirez 
said. 

“It’s Catalan but it’s cross-
listed with Spanish so it’s 
Catalan and Spanish. The 
prerequisites, because it’s a 
291 class, is that the students 
have had Spanish 277 so 
students still come with a 

very good level of Spanish.”

LSA senior Abbey Derechin 

is currently taking a Catalan 
course 
with 
Coll-Ramirez. 

She said she was interested 
in taking the course because 
her family has roots in the 
Catalonian region.

“My uncle is from Catalonia 

and I’ve always wanted to 
learn his native language, 
I guess, because I’ve been 
taking Spanish since seventh 
grade so I can speak with him 
in Spanish but I wanted to 
be able to speak with him in 
Catalan as well.”

Ryan Szpiech, an associate 

professor in the departments 
of 
Romance 
Languages 

and Literatures and Judaic 
Studies, 
said 
along 
with 

familial ties to the region 
like Derechin has, students 
have 
heard 
the 
name 

Catalonia more often after the 
referendum. Szpiech believes 
this will allow the Catalan 
program 
to 
grow 
while 

other larger languages won’t 
because there are no current 
political events happening in 
these larger countries with 
more native speakers. 

“Catalan 
is 
not 
a 
big 

language 
worldwide,” 

Szpiech said. “By comparison, 
Portuguese, another romance 
language, 
is 
far 
more 

abundant as far as native

For sixth straight year, ‘The 
Game’ ends in Buckeyes’ favor

TED JANES

Daily Sports Writer

The Michigan football team 

couldn’t have dreamed of a 
better start, but No. 9 Ohio 
State didn’t let the dream last 
very long.

Michigan 
led 
by 
two 

touchdowns 
early 
in 
the 

second quarter, but just as Ohio 
State quarterback J.T. Barrett 
began getting into rhythm, the 
Wolverines began to blow their 
own lead.

The result? A 31-20 loss — 

the sixth-straight loss to the 
Buckeyes — and an 8-4 record 
to end the regular season.

Michigan’s mistakes arrived 

early, but their implications 
didn’t appear until it was too 
late.

Fifth-year 
senior 

quarterback 
John 
O’Korn 

overthrew open receivers all 
game. He finished with 195 
passing yards on a 53-percent 
completion rate.

Sophomore 
safety 
Josh 

Metellus dropped a potential 
second-quarter interception in 
Michigan’s red zone, and Ohio 
State scored its first touchdown 
on the next play.

Ohio State blocked redshirt 

freshman 
kicker 
Quinn 

Nordin’s extra point in the 
third quarter, and when the 
Wolverines trailed by four on a 

late fourth-quarter drive, they had to play for 
a touchdown — not just a field goal.

“We got a little complacent,” O’Korn said. 

“As players, we let the foot off the gas. This 
game didn’t have to be close. We could’ve 
ran away with it.”

The game was close indeed, because 

aside from all the missed throws and 
botched opportunities, the Wolverines’ 
offense was getting contributions from 
all over at the start.

Fifth-year 
senior 
Khalid 
Hill 

hammered across the goal line 
for the Michigan’s first score, 
and sophomore tight end Sean 
McKeon caught a touchdown 
pass early in the second 
quarter.

Sophomore 
running 

back 
Chris 
Evans 

boosted 
Michigan 

with 67 rushing 
yards, 
and 

freshman 
Donovan 

Peoples-

Jones broke five tackles 

on a 42-yard punt return that gave 

the Wolverines advantageous field positioning for their second 
touchdown.

While football fans streamed 

into 
Michigan 
Stadium 
on 

Saturday morning, Brian Ellison, 
a Libertarian running for U.S. 
Senate, held up a sign that read 
“say no to oral,” written in 
permanent marker.

Along with a half dozen others 

at the corner of South Main Street 
and East Stadium Boulevard, 
Ellison, a resident of Royal Oak, 
protested the Preliminary Oral 
Fluid Analysis pilot program 
recently 
launched 
by 
the 

Michigan State Police. Similar 
to breathalyzing drunk drivers, 
officers can issue a roadside test to 
detect the presence of controlled 
substances in a person’s body by 
analyzing a mouth swab.

The one-year pilot program 

began on Nov. 8 in five counties, 

including 
Washtenaw. 
The 

counties 
were 
chosen 
based 

on the frequency of impaired 
driving crashes and the number 
of drugged drivers arrested, 
according to a press release from 
the Michigan State Police. 

“We just wanted to raise 

awareness,” Ellison said. “It’s 
unconstitutional, it’s really a 
terrible program. You’re forced 
to put something in your mouth 
on the side of the road. You don’t 
have a choice. It’s forced on you.”

Under current law, refusing to 

submit to the drug test is a civil 
infraction.

Mike 
Saliba, 
chair 
of 

Libertarians of Macomb County, 
was among the protesters. He 
called the testing “bunk science.”

“This is one of the areas 

where they’re starting to roll out 
roadside drug testing,” Saliba 
said. “It really doesn’t prove 

anything. It doesn’t help anybody. 
We just think it’s another way for 
the police to generate revenue by 
writing tickets and really ignore 
our Fourth Amendment rights.”

In addition to the initial drug 

test, Drug Recognition Experts 
— officers specially trained to 
identify and deal with impaired 
drivers — also administer a 
12-step 
evaluation, 
which 

includes checking vital signs and 
the size of the driver’s pupils, 
according to the press release. The 
oral fluid analysis is preliminary, 
and positive results are confirmed 
by blood or urine tests.

According to statistics from 

the Michigan State Police, last 
year drugs were involved in 236 
traffic deaths, up 32 percent from 
179 fatalities in 2015.

Col. 
Kriste 
Kibbey 
Etue, 

director of the Michigan State 
Police, said in statement that the 

danger posed by drugged 
driving is increasing.

“Motorists 
under 
the 

influence of drugs pose a risk 
to themselves and others on 
the road,” Etue said. “With 
drugged driving on the rise, 
law enforcement officers need 
an effective tool to assist in 
making these determinations 
during a traffic stop.”

Given the game day fanfare, 

the small but dedicated group 
would occasionally get lost 
in the throngs of people 
and 
then 
reappear 
with 

their homemade signs. One 
woman’s read “swab testing is 
rape.”

Ellison said he expected 

more residents to attend the 
rally.

“I was expecting kind of 

a bigger turnout,” Ellison 
said. “I think we didn’t plan 
on how much it was going 
to cost for people to park 
and maybe that drove some 
people away, but we’ve gotten 
some decent reception from 
that people that have showed 
up. It’s a success as far as I’m 
concerned.”

For the Daily


The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Monday, November 27, 2017 — 3A

speakers around the world. 
After Spanish, it’s the most 
spoken romance language and 
it has more speakers than all the 
others, French, Italian, Catalan, 
Romanian, all of them, except 
Spanish, 
combined. 
So 
that’s 

how big it is. It’s huge and yet … 
(Portuguese has) struggled to get (a 
program) because people don’t see 
the relevance of it. Even though the 
numbers are there, there’s nothing 
politically happening in Portugal or 
Brazil to spark interest.”

When the Parliament of Catalonia 

called for a referendum Sept. 6, the 
Spanish government met them with 
strong legal action, according to 
the Human Rights Watch, an NGO 
that compiles reports on human 
rights abuses worldwide. A few days 
later, the Spanish Constitutional 
Court deemed the referendum 
unconstitutional and illegal.

The 
referendum 
took 
place 

regardless. A 2005 amendment to 
Spain’s Penal Code decriminalized 
voting 
in 
an 
unconstitutional 

referendum and as citizens and 
proponents 
of 
the 
succession 

from Spain turned out to vote the 
day of the referendum, The New 
York Times reported Spanish and 
Catalonian police used excessive 
force 
against 
demonstrators. 

Catalonia’s 
health 
department 

estimated 893 people reported 
injuries after clashes with police.

Szpiech, 
who 
is 
currently 

teaching a Catalan class, said 
reports from the likes of the Times 
and the Human Rights Watch 
fail to mention the severity of the 
separatist movement that called 
for the referendum, claiming the 
movement does not strictly consist 
of peaceful protests and a desire for 
democratic voting practices.

“Everyone (in the department) 

is concerned,” Szpiech said. “This 
movement is very extreme, the 
Catalan independence movement. 
It’s not a centrist movement. It’s 

a pretty far-left movement, some 
people consider right because it’s 
kind of so conservative against the 
state, but it’s definitely something 
where most people are not in the 
zone of saying they’re willing to give 
up or cause injury or cause strife, 
cause war because who knows what 
this could bring? … Spanish society 
is, one way or another, suffering. 
Whether it splits or doesn’t split, 
there’s no good outcome to this, I 
don’t think.”

Coll-Ramirez said when she 

started to teach the first Catalan 
400-level class, she started to see 
a mobilization of this separatist 
movement and she said she 
wanted her students to know 
the background of the region 
and the current politics so they 
understand the reports shared in 
the media and online.

Currently, 
Coll-Ramirez’s 

Catalan class is divided into three 
units: social information, history 
and culture. After the third exam, 
she brings current events such as 
the referendum into conversation 

in order to contextualize political 
Catalanism so the conversations 
aren’t just opinions but rather 
full, informed debates.

“Usually we pull a lot of 

articles,” 
Coll-Ramirez 
said. 

“Students read some articles 
and then I use the class time to 
talk about different positions 
from the Catalan position, from 
the Spanish position and then 
I actually want students to talk 
about … their opinions but I think 
that … it is important that this 
(discussion) happens as the end of 
the semester because the students 
have had the whole semester to 
learn why some people may feel a 
certain way and why some people 
may demand certain things.”

Szpiech said he brings the 

referendum into his class to stress 
that what is taught in the classroom 
does not live solely in the classroom 
and these events are constantly 
evolving, so it’s important to stay 
informed.

“I’ve been trying to start class 

every day with the news, if there 

is some,” Szpiech said. “I put it on 
the screen and say ‘Hey, look what’s 
going on.’ This is a really big deal. 
If you’re a Spanish major, if you’re 
from a Spanish-speaking country, 
if you’re Catalan or interested in 
Catalonia, this is a big deal … It’s 
been good to just give us something 
to talk about and then to remind 
them too like ‘Okay, what are we 
studying?’”

Derechin 
said 
she 
believes 

mentioning 
global 
issues 
and 

promoting dialogue is important 
for a well-rounded education, but 
more discussions should take place 
in one-on-one discussions with the 
professor so individual views on 
the issue can be fine-tuned.

“I think (the referendum) should 

be presented in class, which it was, 
and if there’s a big issue in the 
world like this, have the professor 
say ‘I’m willing to talk to you about 
it if you want to’ and just go to office 
hours,” Derechin said. “I think the 
way (Coll-Ramirez) handled it is 
the right way to do it.”

As seen with Szpiech, many 

Spanish professors are teaching 
Catalan 
classes 
and 
pitching 

courses to appeal to students. 
While 
a 
dichotomy 
between 

Catalan and Spanish instructors 
in regards to the referendum 
may be drawn, Szpiech said the 
department 
is 
united 
against 

extremist movements and in both 
Spanish and Catalan politics.

“The conversations I’ve had 

have all been sort of in agreement 
about 
frustration, 
that 
there 

seems to be a very bold group 
of people who are leading this 
(independence movement) and it’s 
not at all clear that it’s going about 
it in a very representative way,” 
Szpiech said. “Certainly that’s not 
to say (unification) for or against 
independence but … nobody’s 
happy with the way the politicians 
are sort of imposing themselves 
on both sides. Everyone seems 
very heavy-handed so politically, 
I think I’ve been in agreement 
with all my colleagues that this 
is a very ugly thing for both 
sides.”

passed earlier.

“If I was in the fourth or 

third year of the program, I 
would have probably dropped 
out,” Sural said.

He also noted concern over 

how 
the 
bill 
would 
affect 

current 
and 
prospective 

graduate students, specifically 
with 
international 
students 

due to visa laws and work 
restrictions. He said he has 
a friend from India who only 
applied to American schools.

“She now thinks that if this 

bill becomes (a) law, it would 
become financially impossible 
for her to come or to continue 
her Ph.D. here in the U.S.,” 
Sural said.

American students also share 

anxiety over the proposed law. 
University alum Jonté Jones has 
put his Ph.D. pursuit on hold, 
partially due to the reform.

“It’s not just grad students 

it affects, it affects people who 
are lower income,” Jones said. 
“It affects people who are even 
middle income and can’t afford 
a lot of things. It only seems to 
benefit the super wealthy ... it 

just seems like an all around bad 
idea.”

University alum Alex Fox 

fears she will not be able to 
consider graduate school at all 
if the bill passes. She said she 
already has student debt from 

earning 
her 
undergraduate 

degree, and said she did not earn 
enough income doing laboratory 
work for the University and 
hosting at a restaurant to have 
the opportunity to further her 
education. She now works at 
the restaurant full time while 
finding a new job related to her 
field of study.

“I still have been considering 

my Ph.D., and if this passes, 
there’s no way I’m gonna do a 
Ph.D.,” Fox said. “It’s definitely 

not going to happen. There’s no 
way I would be able to afford 
it...it’s a bummer to know that 
that is something I would not be 
able to consider at all.”

In an interview for a previous 

article by The Daily, Public 
Policy 
professor 
Stephanie 

Leiser noted the bill would 
increase 
the 
national 
debt 

and 
would 
burden 
future 

generations.

“The biggest downside of 

(the bill) is that it’s going to 
increase the deficit,” Leiser 
said. “They’re either going to 
increase debt or cut programs. 
Increased debt is nothing more 
than future taxes on our kids 
or grandkids, etc. Or cutting 
programs is obviously going to 
impact people who benefit from 
those programs right now.”

Advocates for the proposal 

argue the decreased costs to 
businesses will promote job 
growth, but some students are 
not convinced.

Rackham 
student 
Carrie 

Johnson, Ph.D. candidate in 
chemical biology, said the tax 
plan has implications far beyond 
the graduate level.

“It’s not good for big pharm to 

have less grad students, because 
that 
means 
less 
patients,” 

Johnson said. 

TAX PLAN

According to Barbara Peitsch, 
the M2GATE’s senior lead 
program 
adviser, 
some 

primary 
ME/NA 
issues 

which teams may address 
include youth unemployment, 
women’s 
rights, 

environmental problems and 
recycling.

The initiative will consist 

of three sessions each lasting 
eight 
weeks 
and 
include 

approximately 200 students. 
The sessions will begin in 
January, 
April 
and 
May, 

respectively. 

During the sessions, teams 

of six will each address their 
social issue in the ME/NA 
region. They will create a 
three to five minute video 
to pitch their ideas. At the 
end, teams’ proposals will 
be entered in a competition. 
The winning ME/NA-based 
team members will have the 
opportunity to travel to Ann 
Arbor to meet their University-
based counterparts, meet with 
professors and pitch their 
proposal to an expert panel.

The initiative is described as 

a “virtual exchange” program, 
highlighting 
its 
intent 
to 

connect young people across 
cultures using technology.

According 
to 
the 
WDI 

website, the program will use 
“technology to empower young 

people from different cultures 
to participate in a kind of 
global classroom, where they 
regularly 
exchange 
ideas, 

work on projects together, and 
develop relationships built on 
mutual respect.’”

The program will utilize 

online 
learning 
modules, 

tutorials and assignments, as 
well online communication 
and 
collaboration 
with 

teammates, 
mentors, 

instructors 
and 
program 

managers.

Amy Gillett, vice president 

of 
Education 
Initiative 

at 
WDI, 
highlighted 
the 

necessary transition to virtual 
partnerships 
taking 
place 

across the world.

“Increasingly 
in 
today’s 

business environment, people 
are working virtually,” Gillett 
said. 
“They 
usually 
don’t 

have the luxury to meet in 
person to work on something 
together, so being able to 
collaborate virtually is a very 
neat skill and more and more 
in demand in the workplace.”

Pietsch 
explained 

M2GATE’s 
cross-cultural 

nature is integral to the 
program, 
as 
it 
aims 
to 

enhance friendly, productive 
and 
efficient 
collaboration 

among students from other 
countries.

“I think it’s very important 

in this day and age and going 
forward to learn how to work 
on 
multicultural 
change,” 

Pietsch said. “This is going 
to give students on both sides 
the 
opportunity 
to 
work 

on a concrete project while 
taking 
into 
consideration 

perspectives that they haven’t 
had to consider before.”

Applications 
for 
the 

program close Dec. 1, and 
several students have already 
submitted their applications 
— 
including 
Engineering 

senior Akihiro Ota.

“I 
hope 
to 
form 

relationships 
with 
like-

minded people to contribute 
to social uplift,” Ota said. 
“I also hope to broaden my 
world view (sic) and gain an 
understanding of how social 
issues 
in 
other 
countries 

compare to those in the U.S. 
I hope, by working with those 
from other countries, to find 
strategies that can be similarly 
be used in the U.S. to improve 
the world around me.”

Gillett is confident M2GATE 

will be valuable in various 
ways to its participants.

“I 
think 
the 
Michigan 

students 
will 
gain 

tremendously 
from 

participating in this project, 
from the skill, relationship, 
and 
resume 
building,” 

Gillett 
said. 
“We 
think 

that friendships and new 
businesses will form, but at 
the very least, people will 
gain greater cultural insight 
and experience collaborating 
virtually.”

places,” Wallander said. “You 
can really decide what matters 
most to you and support that.”

The University will offer 

$150,000 in matching fund for 
certain demographics, such as 
students and first-time donors. 
According 
to 
the 
Giving 

Blueday website, more than 
2,000 new donors contribute 
to Giving Blueday annually. 
Last year, more than 4,000 
programs and funds benefitted.

U-M 
Supermileage 
is 
a 

student 
engineering 
team 

which builds high tech, highly 
fuel efficient cars to compete 
in the Shell Eco-marathon, a 
national challenge in which 
students compete to build the 
most energy efficient vehicle. 
The money they raised through 
Giving Blueday last year went 
toward 
covering 
the 
costs 

associated with the materials 
and designs for their car.

Engineering junior Hannah 

Ferriby, 
PR 
lead 
for 
U-M 

Supermileage, said since the 
Shell Eco-Marathon recently 
relocated 
from 
Detroit 
to 

Sonoma, 
Calif., 
the 
team’s 

travel expenses have increased.

“This year we are mainly 

focusing our efforts within our 
organization since we are less-
known than other engineering 
design teams,” Ferriby said. 
“We 
are 
encouraging 
our 

members to tell their friends 
and family about the different 
opportunities 
for 
them 
to 

donate to our organization and 
we are promoting our giving 
link over our social media 
platforms.”

In 
celebration 
of 
the 

University’s 
Bicentennial, 

social media challenges offered 
throughout the day will award 
additional funds to winners.

“We want to make sure 

students can be a part of the 
day,” Wallander said. “There’s 
a lot of social media challenges 

to inspire everyone who loves 
the University to get involved, 
so students can participate in 
those as well.”

Students who visit the Diag or 

Pierpont Commons on Tuesday 
will have the opportunity to 
recommend programs to be 
randomly selected to win $50. 
Five suggestions will be chosen 
from each location and the 
Student 
Philanthropy 
team 

will make the donation in the 
student’s name.

“When we talk to them, we 

say, ‘What are the areas that 
you think really need more 
donations or more support?’” 
Wallander said. “It just gives 
them the opportunity to be 
asked that question, since that’s 
something that’s being asked 
of everyone who is going to 
participate in Giving Blueday.”

Dance 
Marathon 
at 
the 

University of Michigan has 
been part of Giving Blueday for

host events throughout the day, 
including selling coffee in the

and a fundraiser at Pizza 
House.

Recruitment and Outreach 

Chair 
Raza 
Khan 
said 

the 
money 
DMUM 
raises 

goes 
to 
support 
pediatric 

rehabilitation therapies at C.S. 
Mott Children’s Hospital.

“These 
therapies 
help 

provide children of all abilities 
with experiences that they may 
not necessarily have a chance to 
enjoy on their own,” Khan said. 
“This means that every dollar 
we raise goes toward helping a 
child climb a tree for the first 
time, ride a horse, go bowling, 
or even take a karate class. It is 
an incredibly meaningful cause 
that makes a huge impact on 
both the students in DMUM 
and the families we seek to 
help.”

Contributions 
made 
on 

Tuesday will go to Victors for 
Michigan, a fundraising effort 
launched in 2013 with the goal 
of raising $4 billion for the 
University. The campaign has 
surpassed its initial goal, and 
has made $4.33 billion as of 
October.

However, 
research 

conducted 
in 
May 
by 
the 

Indiana University Lilly Family 
School of Philanthropy found 
that proposed changes to tax 
policy proposed by Congress 
and the Trump administration 
could reduce charitable giving 
by an estimated $4.9 billion to 
$13.1 billion annually.

Wallander is still optimistic. 

The 
Student 
Philanthropy 

Team held information sessions 
prior to Giving Blueday to teach 
student organizations the “best 
practice” for raising money.

“We know that a lot of 

student 
organizations 
are 

passionate about raising funds 
for important causes at the 
University,” 
she 
said. 
“We 

want them to maximize their 
fundraising results for the day 
so that they can push forward 
their missions and have the 
impact that they really want to 
have in the upcoming year.”

GIVING BLUE
From Page 1A

The Wolverines maintained 

possession for over 10 minutes 
in the first quarter, as the 
defense shut down Barrett, 
running back J.K. Dobbins and 
the rest of the Buckeyes. They 
held the Buckeyes to three 
consecutive 
three-and-outs, 

sacked Barrett three times 
and even forced Ohio State to 
negative total yards.

In 
the 
second 
quarter, 

though, the Buckeyes amped 
up their play for 124 yards and 
two touchdowns. Barrett ran in 
the first for 21 yards and tossed 
the second touchdown 25 yards 
to tight end Marcus Bough.

While Ohio State’s offense 

was finally clicking, Michigan’s 
barely saw the field — playing 
for less than six minutes 
in that quarter and losing 
the 
opportunity 
to 
keep 

momentum going.

“After we were up 14-zip, 

we really didn’t touch the 
field 
most 
of 
the 
second 

quarter,” Hill said. “When 
you’re hot, you’re hot. You get 
your momentum going, and 
everybody’s in rhythm. That’s 
when you score points, but 
when you keep the offense off 
the field so long, it’s kind of 
hard to keep that up because 
you’re just sitting there.”

Michigan’s offense scored 

again 
soon 
after 
halftime, 

when junior Karan Higdon 
punched a two-yard run into 
the end zone, but after that, 
more 
Michigan 
mistakes 

followed, and the game quickly 
fell in Ohio State’s favor.

Nordin’s extra point was 

blocked, Dobbins ran in a 
touchdown and then Ohio State 
hit a field goal.

The Wolverines had one 

last-ditch effort, but O’Korn 
misread coverage and saw one 
of his final throws at Michigan 

Stadium land in the arms of a 
Buckeye.

One more touchdown from 

Ohio State’s Mike Weber sealed 
the deal, but the game was 
already over.

“It’s the most bitter pill 

that I’ve had to swallow, 
personally,” 
said 
redshirt 

junior defensive end Chase 
Winovich. “Coming here, four 
years, and not beating these 
guys once. It’s tough.”

The errors amounted, and 

the Wolverines couldn’t hold 
on to their 14-point lead.

O’Korn 
mentioned 

afterward that the game didn’t 
have to be close. It was never 
expected to be, either.

Ohio State was expected to 

run all over Michigan, but for 
one-and-a-half quarters, it was 
just the opposite.

But games don’t come down 

to just one-and-a-half quarters.

“We had to compete the 

whole four quarters,” Hill said. 
“But we just came up short.”

It’s not just 

grad students 

it affects, it 

affects people 
who are lower 

income

There’s a

I

n four years here, I have 
never really played the 
role of outspoken critic 

as it pertains to University 
administration. That 
is, though I may have 
strongly 
disagreed 

with any number of 
decisions made by 
University President 
Mark 
Schlissel 

and the Board of 
Regents, 
I 
never 

truly 
questioned 

the fact that they 
were 
responsible, 

thoughtful 
public 

servants who had the best 
interests 
of 
the 
University 

community at heart. I trusted 
that they were doing their best. 
Last Monday, that changed 
with an email. 

President 
Schlissel’s 

announcement of his decision 
to “begin discussions with 
(white supremacist) Richard 
Spencer’s group” about coming 
to 
campus 
was 
indicative 

not only of abject cowardice, 
but a fundamental lack of 
understanding and a consistent 
disregard for the wishes of the 
student body.

Perhaps the first question 

to be asked is why send out 
such an important email on 
the Tuesday evening before 
Thanksgiving break? Well, it’d 
be just about the same answer 
as why they tend to raise tuition 
over summer break or why 
the Federal Communications 
Commission released a plan to 
pull the rug on net neutrality 
so quickly, so quietly, on the 
same day — because winning 
an argument is a whole lot 
easier when the opposition is 
out of town, or at the very least 
not looking. Our University 
administration, comprised of 
people who at least nominally 
work day in and day out for 
our education and well-being, 
is hiding from us. People don’t 
hide when they’re proud of the 
decisions they’ve made.

Some credit, though, has 

to be given to the Board of 
Regents 
in 
this 
instance. 

They, at the very least, had 
the courage to turn a blind 
eye to the concerns of the 
student 
body 
in 
person, 

during an emergency meeting 
called that evening. Bravo. Of 
the eight, only one, Denise 
Ilitch (D), had the decency to 
challenge the decision.

That 
Richard 
Spencer’s 

filth has no place within a 
hundred miles of this campus 
is indisputable. He is a racist, 
anti-Semitic, despicable excuse 
for a human being, a troll whose 
fame is owed to failed attempts 
to speak on college campuses 
like our own, each one further 
endearing him to a fan base of 

white supremacists, neo-Nazis 
and Ku Klux Klan members. 
Still, President Schlissel has 
made three arguments to justify 

his 
decision, 
each 

more misguided than 
the last.

There’s 
the 

argument 
that 

“denying the request 
would provide even 
more 
attention 
to 

the speaker and his 
cause 
and 
allow 

him to claim a court 
victory.” Two things, 
however, need to be 

recognized here. One, not all 
attention is good attention. A 
story about his request being 
denied starts a debate, while a 
story about his request being 
accepted starts a riot. Two, 
Spencer’s suit against the Ohio 
State University, when they 
refused his request to speak 
last month, is still pending 
and is by no means a definite 
win. Even if it is, there’s merit 
in taking a stand in court on 
behalf of your student body. 
Former University President 
Lee Bollinger did so in two 
2003 cases to defend the 
University’s affirmative action 
policies and won one.

Go 
to 
court, 
President 

Schlissel. Demonstrate that 
the only way Spencer should 
ever be welcomed on this 
campus is because a court of 
law is compelling us to do so 
and not because the University 
administration 
is 
unwilling 

to stand up for our values in 
court. I’m sure the Bursar’s 
Office can find enough to 
cover the legal fees after all the 
tuition hikes carried out since 
I started here.

Then, there’s the assumption 

that “we must allow” all speech 
to 
protect 
our 
democratic 

society. 
First 
Amendment 

absolutists 
will 
point 
to 

Supreme 
Court 
cases 
that 

have affirmed the right to 
hate speech, but these cases 
have dealt with public spaces; 
on college campuses, the law 
is still in a gray area. Spencer 
isn’t organizing a march down 
Main Street or across the Diag, 
he’s submitting an application 
to the University. Therefore, 
the University has a right to 
scrutinize how its space is 
used, based on (1) whether or 
not a potential speaker could 
present a new and valuable 
perspective and (2) whether or 
not that perspective will cause 
harm, mental or otherwise, to 
its student body.

If I were to submit a request 

to use Hill Auditorium for 
a 
three-hour 
lecture 
on 

everything wrong with the 
New 
York 
Mets 
bullpen, 

would anyone question the 

University’s ability to deny that 
request without infringing on 
my rights? Of course not; I’m 
not an expert on anything and 
that doesn’t offer anything of 
real value to this campus. No 
one could stop me from giving 
the same lecture, though, in the 
middle of the Diag. Spencer’s 
case is no different. He’s not 
an expert in any field, nor is he 
an authority on anything. Calls 
for “ethnic cleansing,” chants 
of “blood and soil” and claims 
that Hispanic and Black people 
are genetically inferior are 
neither new nor valuable. 

To 
qualify 
these 
ideas 

as 
reasonable 
perspectives 

different from our own is 
to elevate them. When the 
administration makes space on 
campus for them, it is a clear 
signal to minority populations 
on campus that those ideas 
have merit. So now these two 
rights have come into conflict. 
Personally, I’d bet on the side 
with the law school ranked 
eighth in the country to put up 
a decent fight.

Finally, there’s Schlissel’s 

“foremost priority,” the safety 
and 
security 
of 
those 
on 

campus. The simple fact of the 
matter is that where Richard 
Spencer goes, violence has 
consistently followed, and his 
presence will act as a magnet 
to hate groups across the 
Midwest. Neo-Nazis and Klan 
members will be in the Diag. 
In this case, safety has to mean 
more than physical well-being; 
students of color or of Jewish 
faith cannot be expected to 
simply “ignore him” or revel 
in the “power of a room mostly 
empty,” without suffering in 
terms of mental health. If I 
need to further explain why 
it would be difficult for one of 
these students to feel welcome 
and safe while walking to class 
under 
these 
circumstances, 

you need to reexamine your 
capacity for empathy.

Schlissel’s 
arguments 
are 

insufficient. The way in which 
they 
were 
presented 
was 

cowardly. This administration 
is shrinking away from a fight 
and ignoring the students they 
purport to care about. Richard 
Spencer is on his way to campus. 
His lawyer said “Hail to the 
Victors!” to a reporter. That 
should make everyone on this 
campus sick to their stomach.

I cannot remember being 

any less proud to be a Michigan 
Wolverine. There’s more to be 
said on this, and from more 
diverse voices than my own. 
But for now, we need to call out 
Schlissel’s email for what it is: 
a disgrace.

O

n Nov. 8, the Michigan 
State 
Senate 
passed 

Senate 
Bills 
584 

through 586, which will allow 
gun owners to conceal carry 
firearms in schools, daycares, 
churches and other gun-free 
zones. The vote was split 
almost completely on party 
lines 
— 
state 
Sen. 
Marty 

Knollenburg, R-Troy, was the 
only Republican to vote “no” on 
these bills. With gun violence 
dominating the news cycle, 
this is especially frightening. 
By 
passing 
these 
bills, 

Michigan Senate Republicans 
have clearly shown that they 
don’t care about the safety of 
their constituents.

While the bills will not affect 

the University of Michigan’s 
campus, as the University is 
considered autonomous by the 
Michigan 
Constitution, 
off-

campus gun-free zones will 
be affected. Public libraries, 
churches and bars are all 
fair game. As a student, this 
terrifies me.

Becoming a victim of gun 

violence is extremely unlikely 
— only 31 out of every 1 million 
Americans will become victims 
of gun homicides. However, 
with news on gun violence 
constantly on the television 
or online, it is something I 
fear. If gun owners would be 
allowed to carry concealed 
weapons in gun-free zones, I 
would constantly be worried 
about my safety, which would 
be emotionally draining. I am 
confident that many of my peers 
feel similarly.

While I am worried for my 

own safety, I am more worried 
about the safety of my loved 
ones, who are at a greater risk 

of becoming a victim of these 
bills because they do not attend 
a public university. As students 
at this University, we should be 
doing everything in our power 
to protect our loved ones from 
these bills. The Republicans 
in the Michigan Senate need 
to recognize the frightening 
climate these bills create.

Three 
hundred 
twenty-

three 
mass 
shootings 
had 

occurred by Nov. 18, the 322nd 
day of 2017 — more than one 
every single day. The United 
States is the only country in 
the world with this type of gun 
violence. Eighty-nine out of 100 
Americans own a firearm. As a 
result, the U.S. sees more gun 
violence than other countries. 
According to a CNN report, 
though the U.S. consists of 
only 5 percent of the world’s 
population, 31 percent of the 
world’s mass shooters are in 
the U.S. Gun homicide rates 
are over 25 times higher in 
the U.S. than they are in other 
high-income countries. These 
statistics make it clear to me 
that the Michigan Legislature 
needs to pass laws that restrict 
where one can carry firearms, 
not expand where one can 
carry them. My fear is that 
this bill will further normalize 
guns, and some individuals 
will use these laws to victimize 
more people.

Often, gun advocates argue 

that a “good guy with a gun” is 
needed to stop these episodes of 
gun violence. A “good guy with 
a gun” generally refers to an 
armed civilian who could use 
his gun on an active shooter in 
an event of gun violence. State 
Senate Majority Leader Arlan 
Meekhof, R-West Olive, backed 

up his dangerous bill with this 
childish 
argument. 
Studies 

have shown that the “good guy 
with a gun” is rarely successful 
in stopping an active shooter. A 
2013 FBI study found that only 
3.1 percent of active shooter 
incidents were stopped by an 
armed individual who was not a 
member of law enforcement. 

An 
EPIC-MRA 
poll 
in 

2015 showed that 57 percent 
of 
Michiganders 
oppose 

concealed carry in schools. 
Additionally, 53 percent of 
Michiganders are supportive of 
a complete prohibition of guns 
in schools. Despite popular 
opinion, Senate Republicans 
chose to pass this dangerous 
bill, indicating to me that 
perhaps they are not fit for 
their jobs as representatives.

When the Michigan Senate 

chose to pass these bills, they 
told us they do not care about 
the over 14,000 people who 
have died due to gun violence 
this year. They told us they do 
not care that we have a mass 
shooting every day in the 
U.S. Every Republican who 
has chosen the vote for SB 
584-586 does not deserve the 
office they hold because they 
refuse to listen to the majority 
of 
Michiganders 
and 
have 

decided not to care about the 
safety of their constituents. 
These bills still need to be 
voted on by the Michigan 
House of Representatives and 
signed into law by Governor 
Snyder. I urge the Michigan 
House of Representatives and 
Governor Snyder to stop this 
bill from becoming law.

Due process under #MeToo

LUKE JACOBS | COLUMN

H

istorically, 
men 
have 

used the high burden 
of evidence as a way to 

lock out any and all 
accusations of sexual 
assault or harassment 
in the workplace. This 
barrier 
prevented 

women from making 
their claims in courts, 
human 
resources 

departments 
or 

casually 
with 
their 

male 
friends. 
From 

what I’ve observed, 
the 
power 
of 
the 

#MeToo campaign has spawned a 
larger trend of calling out specific 
men in power. This has, in large 
part, gained its strength from 
minimizing the importance of 
evidence and encouraging the 
public to believe victims’ stories 
at face value. While this system 
has undoubtedly given women 
the justice they would have been 
denied in the past, it seems our 
fervor to correct this past injustice 
has blinded us from protecting a 
vital aspect of our justice system.

Due process isn’t just practiced 

in a courtroom — it is a cultural 
legacy of our democracy which has 
penetrated all aspects of American 
life. To seemingly do away with 
this democratic tradition would 
tarnish the efficacy of the current 
social movement of accusing the 
powerful. We shouldn’t let the 
movement’s current success in 
toppling the systematic cover-
ups of harassment to begin to 
degrade the ideals of due process 
in the long run.

Sexual 
assault 
and/or 

harassment 
is 
a 
notoriously 

difficult crime to prosecute, since 
many 
victims 
feel 
extremely 

uncomfortable 
reporting 
it, 

gathering evidence is difficult and 
the worries of being stigmatized 
by society have suppressed victims’ 
ability to report the crimes. The 
recent celebrity accusations have 
unequivocally 
weakened 
these 

barriers for countless victims, 
giving them strength in numbers 
and support from a renewed spirit 
for justice in the media, college 
campuses and businesses. It used 
to take months for companies 
to discipline a man in a position 
of power, yet over the past few 
weeks we’ve seen countless being 
suspended or resigning within 
days, even hours of their accusers 
coming forward.

In many respects, this sounds 

great. The movement has been 
flushing out many men who have 
been lurking behind the cover 
of evidence and status to protect 
themselves. However, the rapidity 
at which this movement has been 

removing the accused from their 
jobs should sound some alarm 
bells in that it’s almost certainly 

giving 
leeway 
for 

some to falsely accuse 
innocent men and deny 
them sufficient time to 
launch counterclaims 
before 
having 
their 

careers destroyed by 
accusations.

It may be difficult 

to care about this 
issue in light of the 
many women who are 
getting the justice they 

deserve in today’s atmosphere, 
but it must be considered if the 
movement wishes to achieve a 
legacy of fairness. Currently, many 
figures within Hollywood and 
politics have likened it to a witch 
hunt or a new ‘terror’ similar to 
that of Robespierre’s frenzied 
attack on his political opponents in 
the French Revolution.

These critiques have a point, 

and considering their objections 
make for good evidence that the 
movement has been eroding a sense 
of fairness and justice in a general 
sense, even if it is rewarding those 
feelings for many victims. Michèle 
Burke, who has won two Oscars, 
expressed her suspicion of the 
rapidity of these accusations.

“It’s really great that people 

are speaking up. But it’s like 
medieval times, dragging people 
out and throwing rotten fruit. 
There has to be some due process 
also,” Burke said.

Kristie 
Allie, 
an 
actress, 

tweeted, “innocent until proven 
guilty is a fairly sane concept that 
I’m pretty sure each of us would 
like to be afforded.” Clearly, many 
in Hollywood are afraid of a media 
that has replaced due process with 
conviction by Twitter. 

Of the men who have been 

accused by the movement, many 
have confessed and launched a 
series of responses apologizing 
or attempting to explain their 
actions. Clearly, these men should 
be considered guilty; they are 
confessing, after all. Yet there 
is also a substantial number of 
men who have been consistently 
denying the accusations coming 
forward. Robert Herjavec, Shark 
Tank investor, claims his wife has 
fabricated a series of lies to extort 
him for millions. His lawyer’s 
statement that “Mr. Herjavec’s 
character has always been one of 
respect and it is undeniable that 
his actions have always reflected 
that” should not be immediately 
discounted by activists.

Charlie Elphicke, a member of 

the United Kingdom parliament, 
said in a highly charged speech 

to 
party 
members 
that 
the 

government’s 
immediate 
firing 

of the accused was “a mess” and 
“a denial of justice when people 
who have had allegations made 
against them, lose their job or their 
party whip without knowing what 
those allegations are.” Elphicke’s 
comments came in light of recent 
speculation about how the public 
shaming and lack of evidence 
toward another MP may have 
contributed to his suicide days 
after being accused.

It is worrisome that some 

prominent feminists have equated 
accusation with proof. A day after 
allegations broke about Roy Moore, 
the Guardian columnist Jessica 
Valenti attacked Mitch McConnell 
for waiting to condemn him until 
some evidence was presented, 
writing “(he) didn’t elaborate on 
why multiple women going on 
the record wasn’t proof enough of 
the truth.” Though it has become 
clearer in the following weeks 
that Moore’s case is a guilty one, 
Valenti’s 
rushed 
statement 
is 

exactly the strain of thought that 
is substantiating the witch hunt 
argument — yes, multiple women 
coming forward is certainly 
more believable than one, but it 
doesn’t completely eliminate the 
right of the accused to press a 
defending argument.

In an ideal world, there would 

first be accusations, followed by a 
period of silence from the media 
as legal and private investigations 
determine the facts of the case, 
and when the claims are either 
substantiated or falsified, reaction 
from businesses and the media 
should follow. This would also 
put an end to the craziness of 
Hollywood studios prematurely 
cancelling dozens of productions, 
which 
unjustly 
punishes 
the 

hundreds of staffers who have 
worked hard to create them due to 
the alleged actions of a single man 
connected to the show.

Since we don’t live in an ideal 

world, and many women would be 
denied justice by the heavy burden 
of proof during the investigative 
phase, it is hard to prescribe a 
solution. What is needed as the 
movement 
continues 
forward, 

however, is a more case-by-case 
judgment of the accused, and 
not simply defaulting to public 
shaming hours after an accusation. 
Hopefully this will bring some 
sense of justice to all sides of the 
equation — the victims and the 
falsely accused — and preserve a 
general sense of fairness that is 
afforded to all of us.

The 1986 film hits the small screen of Netflix.
Lee revamps for TV his 
hit ‘She’s Gotta Have It’

The director’s 1986 debut recieves a refreshing makeover

Love yourself, even if society 

doesn’t want you to.

That seems to be one of the 

many 
underlying 
messages 

of “She’s Gotta Have It,” the 
refreshing television adaptation 
of Spike Lee’s (“Oldboy”) 1986 
debut. For Nola Darling (DeWanda 
Wise, 
“Underground”), 
the 

show’s striking protagonist, self-
love comes at the price of being 
fetishized by her romantic suitors, 
objectified by male strangers and 
traumatized by her own demons. 
But toward the end of the first 
episode, Nola rejects the negative 
labels attached to her identity. 
She stares down the camera and 
says with fierce conviction that 
she’s “not a freak, a sex addict and 
damn sure nobody’s property.” 
Though this show may not be 
for everyone, Nola’s unrelenting 
confidence and exuberant charm 
in moments like these make “She’s 
Gotta Have It” worth watching.

While it shares the same 

premise as the original film — an 
independent Black woman from 
Brooklyn entangles herself in a 
love quadrangle — the TV version 
of “She’s Gotta Have It” explores 
much more than its tantalizing 
plot suggests. From polyamory 
to sexual fluidity, psychotherapy 
to 
self-acceptance, 
sexual 

assault to feminism, the show 
juggles an array of heavy topics, 
creating both a stimulating and 
disorienting viewing experience. 
But by focusing on one specific 
theme at a time in each episode, 
“She’s Gotta Have It” dedicates 
a healthy amount of attention to 
how these complex topics propel 
Nola’s character arc.

Particularly during the third 

episode (so far my favorite), 
Nola faces her biggest challenge 
when she buys a skimpy black 
dress to boost her self-esteem 
and subsequently draws mixed 
reactions from the three men she’s 
dating — thoughtful businessman 
Jamie Overstreet (Lyriq Bent, 
“Saw IV”), playful biker Mars 
Blackmon 
(Anthony 
Ramos, 

“White Girl”) and narcissistic 
photographer Greer Childs (Cleo 
Anthony, “Transparent”). On a 
fancy dinner date, Jamie becomes 
overprotective of Nola, telling her 

dress is too “night-clubby” for a 
nice restaurant and shielding it 
from strangers with his sports 
coat. Mars gives Nola flak for 
provoking an aggressor at a 
reggaeton concert because of how 
sexy her dress looks. But perhaps 
the most effective damage on 
Nola’s ego comes from Greer, 
when he photographs her while 
commenting her dress and looks 
in a lecherous, Terry Richardson-
type manner.

Each of these encounters leaves 

Nola deeply uncomfortable, but 
also empowered to turn her 
suffering into art. She takes 
the dress and pins it to a blank 
canvas, signifying how the dress 
doesn’t define her and that she 

has the willpower to control 
how she responds to what people 
think of her. Wise’s impeccable 
performance 
also 
perfectly 

captures the emotional intensity 
and gravity in these scenes. She 
channels 
anger, 
frustration, 

happiness and longing with such 
nuance that it’s almost hard not 
to recognize and empathize with 
her character’s pain. 

For all of its enchanting 

acting and mesmerizing social 
commentary, “She’s Gotta Have 
It” is by no means a conventional 
watch. 
The 
show 
frequently 

breaks the fourth wall without 
warning, a technique Lee has 
employed in the original film and 
in his other 1989 classic, “Do the 
Right Thing.” In some moments, 
having characters address the 
viewer directly benefits the 
dynamism and urgency of the 
show’s monologues. In one brief 
but stunning scene from episode 
five, Nola’s boss Raqueletta Moss 
(De’Adre Aziza, “The Breaks”) 
tells both Nola and the audience 
about how she conquered the 
traumas of her past to make it 
as an elite elementary school 
principal for at-risk students 
of color. It doesn’t necessarily 
propel the plot in any way, but the 

power of Moss’s words speaks 
volumes of the level of depth Lee 
and his team of writers imbue in 
each of the characters, no matter 
if they are secondary to the story.

That being said, other scenes 

that break the fourth wall 
can elicit an entirely different 
reaction, such as when Nola 
ends a speech about her defiance 
against a man who assaulted her 
in the pilot episode by saying, 
“Black 
Lives 
Matter.” 
Even 

though the statement emerges 
may seem jarring in the moment, 
Black identity is part of who 
Nola is and mentioning the 
BLM movement doesn’t negate 
that whatsoever. This is Lee’s 
attempt to emphasize how Black 
solidarity is always an intrinsic 
part of being Black in America, 
regardless of the context. And 
however the message is intended, 
Lee’s portrayal of modern-day 
Black life through Nola Darling 
is undeniably admirable and 
remains a testament to his acute 
storytelling style and inclusion of 
actors of color in primary roles.

As meticulous as the show may 

be about identity and art, “She’s 
Gotta Have It” isn’t without 
its faults. The pacing of each 
episode is slightly sluggish and 
other ongoing subplots — Nola’s 
friend Shemekka (Chyna Layne, 
“Precious”) receives butt implants 
to enhance her burlesque dancing 
— don’t hit the same emotional 
beats as the main story.

But part of what makes the 

updated version of “She’s Gotta 
Have It” so enthralling is how it 
portrays Nola’s many layers as an 
autonomous Black woman. The 
show’s selection of hip hop and 
R&B music — some include The 
Roots, Solange, The Isley Brothers 
and Prince — both shape Nola’s 
cultured aesthetic tastes and 
evoke the spectrum of emotion 
she carries throughout the show. 
Nola’s relationship to Brooklyn 
also enhances the core aesthetic 
of “She’s Gotta Have It”; the 
show itself is also a love letter to 
Brooklyn, incorporating images 
that portray the borough’s rich 
past and present in its collage-like 
opening title sequence.

For Nola Darling, the only way 

to navigate through the scary, 
intimidating 
male-dominated 

world is by finding the beauty in 
it.

Have It”

Netflix

WALT DISNEY

Pixar succeeds in the thoughtful, touching animated feature
Pixar’s new ‘Coco’ is the 
studio’s best film in years

Culturally cognizant and nuanced, Pixar’s latest makes waves

To say that Hollywood has 

struggled with representation of 
minorities would be a bit of an 
understatement. It seems that every 
few months moviegoers are treated 
to a fresh controversy concerning 
casting choices and depiction 
of cultures in film, such as the 
decision to have Scarlett Johansson 
(“Rough Night”) play the Japanese 
heroine of 2017’s “Ghost in the 
Shell.” 
Moreover, 
Hollywood’s 

most prominent directors and 
writers are overwhelmingly white 
men.

When Pixar’s latest release, 

“Coco,” was announced in 2013 
under the title “Dia de los Muertos,” 
it seemed like the film would be 
yet another example of tone-deaf 
Hollywood drivel as Disney moved 
to trademark the name of the 
Mexican holiday, stirring outrage 
from the Southern Californian 
Latino community. Learning from 
its mistakes, Pixar changed the 
name to “Coco” and recruited 
several experts on Mexican culture 
and history to consult throughout 
the creative process concerning the 
studio’s depiction of the culture.

The result is one of the most 

thoughtful, 
nuanced 
and 
all 

around gorgeous depictions of 
Mexican culture ever to come from 
mainstream Hollywood. “Coco” 
follows a young boy named Miguel 
(Anthony Gonzales, “Imagination 
of Young”), an aspiring musician 
facing his family’s generations-
old ban on music. When Miguel 
attempts to steal a guitar from the 
tomb of his favorite musician, he 
is transported to the Land of the 

Dead and must find his way home 
before sunrise lest he be trapped 
there forever.

The film’s story could perhaps 

be 
one 
place 
for 
complaint. 

Thematically, it’s color-by-numbers 
Disney; so long as characters 
follow their hearts and believe, all 
their dreams will come true. It’s a 
formula that the studio has done 
to perfection, and it follows an 
emotional arc that will feel very 
familiar to Pixar fans, from its main 
character’s hopeful optimism to 
its tear-jerking emotional climax. 
Some plot points felt predictable; 

some would-be big reveals could 
be seen coming. That said, there’s 
nothing inherently wrong with 
sticking to what works, especially 
when the film’s true strengths lie in 
its details.

The 
film 
brings 
together 

numerous details about Mexican 
culture, 
from 
the 
glowing, 

patterned alebrijes (spirit animals) 
that live in the Land of the Dead 
to an appearance from the spirit 
of Frida Kahlo. These details 
never once feel like a contrived 
token for diversity, but instead 
combine to make “Coco” one of 
the most immersive animated 
experiences of the year. While 
“Coco” does have a story to tell — 
and a heartwarming one at that 
— it feels like part of the film’s goal 

was simply to write a love letter to 
Mexican culture and heritage, a 
goal it achieves in spades. The film 
is a vibrant, beautiful portrait of a 
people and their culture.

Moreover, “Coco” may very 

well be one of the most technically 
impressive and visually stunning 
animated films ever made. This is 
visible from little details, like the 
way leaves on the ground pulse 
and glow when Miguel strums a 
guitar, to big, ambitious settings 
like The Land of the Dead, depicted 
in the film as a sprawling, glowing 
metropolis that’s built atop itself 
and is impossibly tall. The character 
design is delightfully unique, and 
each character has a liveliness and 
rhythm to their movements that 
helps to build their character, from 
the skeleton-esque limp of Héctor 
(Gael García Bernal, “If You Saw 
His Heart”) to the comedic flailing 
of Dante, a stray Mexican Hairless 
Dog and Miguel’s sidekick.

The film’s story may not be 

terribly unique, but everything else 
about the film is, and is done with 
such virtuosic attention to detail 
that it completely silences whatever 
issues one may take with the plot. 
“Coco” does more than paint a vivid 
picture, it invites audiences to step 
through the looking glass into a 
stunningly beautiful world teeming 
with creativity. What’s more, the 
film’s lovingly nuanced depiction 
of Mexican culture should be the 
benchmark for respectful depiction 
and 
minority 
representation 

in 
Hollywood 
going 
forward. 

Shattering box-office records in 
Mexico within days of opening, 
“Coco” is not only a great movie, 
it’s also a great example of what 
happens when big studios take the 
time to ask questions, learn about a 
culture and do it right.

The indomitable power 

of Anna Akhmatova

Early last year, I was on a 

quest to find poets I thought 
were like Bob Dylan. I didn’t 
want replicas of him, but I was 
inspired by the instantaneous 
ways he could access symbolism, 
and the way in which he could 
pack so much meaning into the 
span of only a few lyrics. I knew 
these were literary qualities, 
and I wanted to find a style of 
poetry that excited me as much 
as the style of his songwriting.

Naturally, 
I 
went 
first 

to 
Dylan’s 
own 
admitted 

influences: 
Dylan 
Thomas, 

Arthur Rimbaud, even Paul 
Verlaine to a certain extent. I 
definitely saw where Dylan had 
gotten a lot of what he used: 
the innovative amalgamations 
of 
language, 
the 
empathic 

attention to specific moments. 
But Thomas’s work didn’t make 
a whole lot of sense to me at 
the time, and for some reason, 
Rimbaud’s didn’t really do it for 
me, either.

I soon drifted out of the 

phase, and over the course of 
the past year, I’ve coincidentally 
run into a few poets who have 
done the trick for me — W.H. 
Auden would probably be the 
strongest example.

But recently, I found someone 

who completely hits the nail on 
the head: Anna Akhmatova.

By “hits the nail on the head,” 

let me clarify that I don’t mean 
she sounds like Bob Dylan. 
No poet should be lauded for 
convincingly 
sounding 
like 

another 
one. 
(Anyway, 
she 

came first, so it might be more 
accurate to say he sounds like 
her.) Instead, I mean that she 
captures 
moments 
with 
an 

uncanny completion; she pays 
enormous attention to detail, yet 
is careful not to let that detail 
overpower her own voice. In 
short, she is one of those poets 
whose work makes you know 
that you’ve felt it.

Akhmatova 
was 
born 
in 

1889 and spent her life in 
Russia. Much of her life was 
affected by the turbulence of 
Russian politics at the time; 
her expansive poem “Requiem” 
deals with the subject of the 
Stalinist terror, which saw the 
arrest of her son and the arrest 
and execution of her husband, 
Nikolay Gumilyov. Many of her 

friends were also killed, and at 
one point her poetry was barred 
from publication.

As someone who lived through 

two world wars and a great deal 
of 
domestic 
conflict 
within 

Russia, her work is contoured 
with politics: She describes the 
torment of wishing for her son’s 
freedom and the conflict of not 
knowing whether or not to leave 
the country, but she was also 
patriotic. She regularly read 
her work to soldiers in hospitals 
and on the front lines, even 
while the forces of the political 
climate closed in on her from all 

sides. During a period of time 
in which Stalin was constantly 
monitoring her, she, along with 
other Russian writers of the 
time period, would pass along 
poems orally, or by writing them 
down, reading them aloud and 
then immediately burning them.

One story that struck me in 

particular happened in the early 
1930s. Akhmatova’s son was 
imprisoned at the time, and she 
would go regularly to deliver 
food for him. One day, a woman 
recognized her outside a stone 
prison and asked in a whisper, 
“Can you describe this?” When 
Akhmatova replied, “I can,” she 
would later describe “something 
like a smile (passing) fleetingly 
over what had once been (the 
woman’s) face.”

These 
stories 
about 

Akhmatova’s life and approach 
to 
writing 
represent 
what 

is often the most powerful 
about literature as a whole. 
Akhmatova’s 
profession 
was 

that of a writer, and yet even that 
was power enough to change the 
lives of those around her — the 
woman, whose lips Akhmatova 
described as “blue from cold,” 
knew 
Akhmatova 
may 
not 

have been able to help her in a 
tangible sense. But by describing 
what she saw at the prison, 
she altered that story, and she 
gave that woman a voice. She 
was committed enough to her 
writing to memorize and burn 
her own work to prevent her 
ideas from being compromised, 
and committed enough to her 
country to stay and try to help 
her fellow citizens even while 
she herself was on the verge of 
being arrested.

This tension and patriotic 

conflict 
can 
be 
seen 
in 

Akhmatova’s work, along with 
her 
personal 
stubbornness 

and authoritative will. In both 
her personal relationships and 
her poetry, Akhmatova was 
constantly asserting her own 
agency. However, her poems 
also highlight beauty, intimacy 
and nature in ways that are 
touchingly genuine. Her poem 
“Snow,” for instance, is no less 
vivid or gentle than Robert 
Frost’s famous “Stopping by 
Woods on a Snowy Evening.” 
“Lot’s Wife” recounts a familiar 
legend with a voice of pure 
empathy; “Willow” is honest 
and mournful.

A good poem, in many ways, 

LAURA 
DZUBAY

has the same goal as a good song. 
It will come at you honestly. It 
will be vivid and well-spoken. 
Maybe it will tell you the story 
of a specific person or a place, in 
the hope that you will come to 
understand that person or place 
better than you had before. 
It will show you something 
emotional, and you will be 

glad to have seen it — what’s 
more, maybe now you will have 
something to show to somebody 
else.

Every 
writer 
does 
this 

differently. Anna Akhmatova 
did 
it 
with 
a 
power 
and 

determination that would be 
amazing to find anywhere, 
but are especially amazing 

given the context of her life. 
No change ever really stops 
happening, and many of the 
works that Akhmatova was 
known for throughout her life 
are still useful to us today if we 
wish to understand not only her 
and her surroundings, but also 
the importance of literary work 
to humanity in general.

Back Together.” Red represents 
all of Swift’s best qualities, 
an icon perfectly balancing 
the line between pop queen 
and charming indie singer-
songwriter; 
it’s 
an 
honest 

record filled with grounded 
human 
emotions 
— 
honest 

enough to reach through to an 
angsty, punk-fueled 16-year-
old. Swift followed up Red 
with 2014’s 1989, where she 
finally took a bigger leap into 
the realm of pop music without 
really losing the emotional 
attainability of her previous 
work, albeit being slightly less 
memorable than Red.

So what the hell happened 

with reputation?

On her latest record, “the new 

Taylor” is a canvas for her worst 
facets, seemingly exacerbated 
by the media. The new Taylor 
is unlovable, but she’s also 
promiscuous. The new Taylor is 
bad, but she can’t be blamed for 
it. reputation is quite frankly 
a jarring album, which could 
have been easily predicted from 
the first single. In 2017, Swift 
presents herself as messy and 
scattered, expertly explained 
by fellow Daily writer Danny 
Madion in his review. She damn 
near did the impossible and 
made her music hard to like on 
reputation.

Don’t 
get 
me 
wrong, 

reputation 
isn’t 
entirely 

insufferable. “Dancing With 
Our Hands Tied,” minus the 
cringe-worthy, EDM drenched 
chorus, is a pretty decent work 
of modern pop. Swift shows 
her sexual side on “Dress” in 
a more emotional way devoid 
of the inflammatory finger-
pointing seen on “Delicate” 
and “Gorgeous.” But for all its 
merited moments, reputation 
shows a side of Swift that 
serves to sever the personal 

connection many listeners had 
with her and her narratives. 
With a full move to bombastic 
pop, Swift’s musical focus shifts 
from her reflections on love 
and life to examine her portrait 
in the public eye, producing 
dismal, 
almost 
nauseating 

results.

Most troubling is trying to 

determine just how much of 
this is actually Swift’s fault. 
For almost a decade, she has 
been 
plagued 
by 
negative 

media coverage. It has hovered 

over 
and 
dissected 
her 

character ruthlessly, ripping 
her interpersonal interactions 
with other celebrities (both 
good and bad) to shreds. Can 
we reasonably expect Swift to 
ignore it all? Did we really think 
she’d write another sappy love 
record steeped with the deeply 
personal narratives the media 
so greedily analyzed? Swift 
showed a critical and clever 
self-awareness of her current 
image on “Look What You 
Made Me Do,” but beyond this, 
her lyricism on reputation holds 
little weight in its attempt at 

justification for her treatment 
by the media.

As non-celebrities, it can 

be hard for us to put ourselves 
into 
the 
shoes 
of 
massive 

stars. In Swift’s case, it can 
be 
even 
harder 
when 
the 

media 
continuously 
paints 

her 
innocent 
country 
girl 

aesthetic as a veil for a more 
insidious, heartless pop star. 
One can only assume another 
narrative-driven love record 
would be turned inside-out by 
the media, further pinning her 
under the weight of her self-
crafted persona. It’s really no 
surprise that Swift wants to be 
excluded from her own public 
narrative. reputation puts Swift 
at her most self-conscious, and 
in writing the album, as poor as 
it is, Swift excels at emptying 
the fuel the media has used 
for years to keep her on the 
front burner. What she has left 
them are lyrics accepting or 
confronting every slanderous 
headline that has already been 
written about her.

In 
hindsight, 
reputation 

was a very natural response 
to the way Swift’s image has 
been morphed and mutilated 
by the public eye. Swift had 
been backed into a corner, left 
with little else to write about. 
I don’t blame her for becoming 
defensive. I don’t blame her 
for trying to remove herself 
from the narrative. I don’t 
blame her for writing her most 
aggressive pop album yet even 
if it’s at the cost of listenability 
and likability. For now, I’ll 
continue to love the old Taylor, 
to sing along to “Red” and 
“Better Than Revenge,” and 
to hope that Swift will rise 
from the ashes of reputation 
like 
a 
pissed-off 
phoenix 

with vengeful pop of a higher 
caliber.

In hindsight, 
reputation was 
a very natural 
response to the 

way Swift’s image 
has been morphed 
and mutilated by 

the public eye


Dealt a bad hand
In Saturday’s loss, Ohio 
State did what Michigan 

has tried to do all year: win 

with its backup quarterback.

Instagram, that he will be

for the 2018 season.

It was all there for the 

taking. 

With 2:47 left in the 

fourth quarter, Michigan 
needed 77 yards. 77 yards 
to beat a team it can 
never beat. 77 yards to 
erase 13 years of bitter, 
tear-inducing history. 

The Wolverines had 

everything they wanted 
in front of them. And yet 
again, for the 13th time 
in 14 years, they were 
left stunned, able only to 
picture what might have 
been.

It 
was 
almost 
as 

predictable as watching 
Charlie Brown get the 
football yanked out from 
under him.

“We had a few mistakes 

offensively, we had a few 
mistakes 
defensively,” 

said Jim Harbaugh, “and 
we had a few more than 
they did.”

What made Saturday’s 

31-20 loss to No. 9 Ohio 
State all the more brutal 
for Michigan? Just how 
things ended.

After 
the 
Buckeyes 

missed a late fourth-
quarter 
field 
goal 

attempt that would have 
extended their lead 
to seven, the 
Wolverines 
huddled 
around their 
head 
coach. 

The 
crowd 

readied itself in 
anticipation for a 
historic drive, the 
type that can cement 
one’s legacy here.

That 
hope 

disappeared 
just 
as 

quickly as it came.

The staff called for a 

play-action pass. John 
O’Korn dropped back, 
surveying 
the 
field 

quickly, before throwing 
perhaps 
the 
worst 

interception the crowd 
at Michigan Stadium has 
seen in years. 

Three plays later, Mike 

Weber Jr. walked into the 
end zone and celebrated 
with visiting Ohio State 
fans. The majority of the 
crowd headed for the 
exits.

After the game, O’Korn 

took full responsibility. 
Harbaugh said that the 
intended receiver, Kekoa 
Crawford, had run the 
correct 
route 
against 

Ohio 
State’s 
defense. 

His 
fifth-year 
senior 

quarterback 
simply 

misread the coverage. 

Just 
another 

mistake.

“It was 
one of 
those 

ones 

that you 

just 

see 
it wrong and 
as soon as the 
ball is in the 
air, 
you 
wish 

you could have 
it back,” O’Korn 
said, “and you 
know 
what 

the 
result 

is going to 
be, 
but 

you can’t 
change 
it.”

Of 

course, 
it 

was 
a 

game 
chock-

full 
of 

those type of mistakes. 

There 
was 
an 

overthrown pass on 

4th-and-4 that saw Chris 
Evans, who had been 
wide-open, 
lying 
on 

the field in pure agony 
over the incompletion. 
Naturally, 
Michigan 

had only been in that 
situation 
because 
it 

botched 
a 
routine 

handoff 
on 

2nd-and-1. 
Before 

both 
of 

those, there 

was a dropped 

interception — as 

easy as the gift the 

Buckeyes got at the end of 
the game — that allowed 
Ohio State to score just 
seconds later.

Hell, it’s been a series 

chock-full of those type 
of mistakes. Every year 

there’s something. 

Wilton 
Speight 

fumbling 
a 
snap 

near Ohio State’s 

goal-line. 

The 
defense 

allowing 

Curtis 
Samuel 
to wriggle 
free 
out 

of 
the 

backfield, 

setting up the play 

that 
will 
forever 
be 

known as The Spot. A 
previous coaching staff 
sending out the offense 
in the same formation 
with the same 2-point 
conversion 
play 
even 

after the Buckeyes called 
a 
timeout, 
noticing 

something 
they 
didn’t 

like. 

All 
of 
those 
— 

along 
with 
O’Korn’s 

interception 
Saturday 

— are marked indelibly 
into the identity of this 
program. Those type of 
plays have left it on the 
wrong side of history 
time and time again. 

Michigan easily could 

have 
pulled 
off 
the 

upset Saturday. It easily 
could have pulled off the 
upset in previous years. 
Quite simply, it couldn’t 
execute. It hasn’t been 
able to execute for too 
long. 
And 
that’s 
just 

recipe for heartbreak.

“The hardest part for 

me is you come here to 
win this game, and our 
senior class wasn’t able to 
do it,” O’Korn said after 
the game as he broke 
down crying. “I hold 
myself responsible for a 
lot of that, and it sucks, 
and I can’t imagine a 
worse feeling right now.”

A stacked deck

T

he play was routine. 

With just over six 

minutes remaining in 

the third quarter, J.T. Barrett 
scrambled for 10 yards on 
2nd-and-11. Fifth-year senior 
linebacker 
Mike 
McCray 
brought 
Barrett 
down by his 
legs. Barrett 
stood 
up, then 
grabbed at 
his right 
knee and 
went back 
to the turf. The trainers came 
out. Barrett’s day ended with a 
hobbled walk to the tunnel.

At that point, the Wolverines 

led by six, despite surrendering 
a 14-point, first-quarter lead. 

Maybe you thought then that 

Michigan was finally going to 
change history, that a backup 
quarterback was incapable of 
leading his team on a comeback 
trail.

I wouldn’t have blamed you if 

you did. That’s all this fan base 
has known for the better part 
of three months. The Michigan 
faithful have learned time and 
time again this year that there’s 
no replacing the starting man 
under center.

But if you thought Barrett’s 

premature exit was enough, you 
were wrong.

Because the Buckeyes did 

what Michigan has failed to 
do for much of its season. They 
coped with the loss of their 
starting quarterback, and 
found success in the largest of 
moments anyway.

For Ohio State, its spot in 

the Big Ten championship 
game was already a lock. But 
a continuation of nearly two 
decades of dominance — and 
a possibility to sneak into the 
College Football Playoff that 
now has legitimate weight — 

were on the line in Ann Arbor.

The Wolverines have found 

themselves in similar situations 
for the better part of 10 years, 
albeit with far less encouraging 
results.

And in the latest iteration, 

Urban Meyer handed Dwayne 
Haskins the keys. The redshirt 
freshman pushed the accelerator 
to the floor.

He handled the ball off twice 

to open the series, then rushed 
for two yards. Two plays later, 
he completed a pass for a four-
yard gain.

Ohio State left tackle Jamarco 

Jones had to leave the game 
with an injury. Then came 
two false starts. Faced with 
3rd-and-13 near midfield, 
Haskins dropped back and 
delivered a 27-yard dime to 
Austin Mack on the sideline.

Two plays later, he escaped a 

collapsing pocket and took off 
for a gain of 22, coming only one 
yard shy of reaching the pylon.

J.K. Dobbins punched it in on 

the next play. The Wolverines 
surrendered their lead and 
wouldn’t get it back.

It was a performance that 

encapsulated all that Michigan 
has tried to do. Ohio State put 
the ball in Haskins’ hands 
with confidence and the fans 
embraced it — some even called 
for it after the Buckeyes lost to 
Iowa. And Haskins delivered, 
exuding a swagger that loomed 
large over Michigan Stadium.

After the game, sophomore 

defensive end Rashan Gary said 
Michigan knew what Haskins 
liked to do. McCray said he was 
“about the same as J.T.”

He looked better.

The Wolverines may have 

known what Haskins liked 
to do, but he did it anyway — 
completing six of his seven 
attempts for 94 yards, all while 
rushing three times for 24 
yards.

“We knew that the guy 

behind (Barrett) was pretty 
good,” McCray said. “We 
wanted to play our game, keep 
playing our game — didn’t want 
to change anything. He came in 
and did a great job.”

Just like that, for the second 

time in four years, J.T. Barrett 
left the second half injured 
against Michigan and the 
Buckeyes’ backup again did 
what he needed to. This time it 
was Haskins. Last time it was 
Cardale Jones.

Of course, Jones’ experience 

was different. Ohio State was up 

by seven, and with Ezekiel Elliot 
in the backfield, he was asked to 
throw the ball just three times. 
But we all know where Jones 
eventually took the Buckeyes.

Perhaps that says more 

than we think about the state 
of these two programs. Ohio 
State’s roster can be supported 
by backups, seemingly without 
a dropoff. The Buckeyes went 
to the College Football Playoff 
as the youngest team in the 
country, according to Phil Steele 
of ESPN.

The Wolverines entered this 

season in a similar situation. 
They finished fourth in the Big 
Ten East. 

As for the on-the-field 

rivalry, Michigan hasn’t been 
very fortunate. Since 2007, 
only two of Michigan’s starting 
quarterbacks have entered the 

Ohio State game healthy and 
left the same way. One of those 
instances came in 2011, when 
Denard Robinson amassed 337 
all-purpose yards and five total 
touchdowns to lead Michigan 
past Ohio State for the only time 
in this decade.

There was no superhero 

performance this Saturday, 
though. With Brandon Peters 
and Wilton Speight sidelined, 
Michigan’s hand was forced.

Jim Harbaugh put the keys 

in his backup’s hands too, but it 
looked like the emergency brake 
was on.

O’Korn struggled early, 

missing open receivers for 
what should have been routine 
completions. He missed a wide-
open Chris Evans on 4th-and-4. 
And with a final chance to 
change the rivalry — at least for 
a year — he misread coverage 
and sailed a pass into the arms 
of Ohio State’s Jordan Fuller.

For what it’s worth, O’Korn 

personified a leader after the 
game. He sat at a podium, and 
he fielded questions. He took 
responsibility for the loss. He 
choked up in front of a room 
of crowded people, trying to 
come to grips with the reality 
that another senior class — one 
he himself is a part of — was 
leaving Ann Arbor without a 
win over the Buckeyes.

But maturity simply wasn’t 

enough. Another year came, and 
another year went.

The dust has now settled.
Michigan has been dealt a 

tough hand for the better part of 
10 years.

Ohio State, on the other hand, 

has triumphed regardless of the 
hand it was dealt.

And therein lies the point: 

when you’re sitting at the table 
with the sharks, you still need to 
find a way to win.

Four Things We Learned: No. 8 Ohio State

The 
curtains 
closed 
on 

Michigan’s regular season this 
weekend, and the finale went 
just as planned — for Ohio State. 

The eighth-ranked Buckeyes’ 

31-20 win over the Wolverines 
(5-4 
Big 
Ten, 
8-4 
overall) 

came after a shaky start, but 
everything 
changed 
in 
the 

second quarter as quarterback 
J.T. Barrett, and later his backup 
Dwayne 
Haskins, 
led 
the 

comeback.

Here are four things the Daily 

learned about the Michigan 
football team from Saturday’s 
loss:

1. Maybe it’s time to ditch 

the pocket passer

If the offensive line can’t 

protect the quarterback, does it 
matter how good his arm is?

The Wolverines’ run game has 

carried the team all season long, 
and Saturday was the same story.

Sophomore 
running 
back 

Chris Evans rushed for 67 
yards and junior Karan Higdon 
ran for 55. The two have been 
Michigan’s 
most 
dynamic 

players throughout the season. 
The run game has been so strong 
because of Evans and Higdon, 
and it has been the Wolverines’ 

only option.

Just 
look 
at 
what 
other 

successful college football teams 
are doing.

No. 5 Alabama runs a spread 

offense with its dual-threat 
quarterback Jalen Hurts. No. 
8 
Ohio 
State’s 
quarterbacks 

have always been quick on the 
ground, too, and No. 2 Oklahoma 
and Heisman favorite Baker 
Mayfield favor the spread-style 
offense as well.

A spread system would give 

Michigan more options on the 
ground, and play to the team’s 
strengths.

Until Michigan finds a top 

passer who can thread the needle 
and hit the deep ball, it might be 
a worthwhile investment to look 
for a mobile quarterback.

2. Michigan’s getting closer 

to beating Ohio State, but not 
there yet

While the Buckeyes ended up 

with a convincing 11-point win, 
the game was closer than the 
final score indicated.

The 
Wolverines 
would’ve 

been able to play for a game-tying 
field goal on their penultimate 
drive, but a blocked extra point 
after 
Higdon’s 
third-quarter 

touchdown forced Michigan to 
rely on O’Korn to move the ball 
downfield with his arm.

Little plays like that blocked 

extra 
point 
or 
sophomore 

safety Josh Metellus’s dropped 
interception added up and put 
the team in a difficult position. 
Ohio State didn’t make nearly as 
many mistakes, and that proved 
to be the difference.

In hindsight, though, the 

Wolverines have done better than 
they did in the past. This year’s 
game and last year’s overtime 
finish were significantly closer 
than the 42-13 blowout Michigan 
faced in 2015.

3. The Harbaugh critics will 

be loud and clear

Michigan 
coach 
Jim 

Harbaugh is now 0-3 versus Ohio 
State. He’s 1-2 against Michigan 
State.

And in three seasons, the 

Wolverines haven’t beaten a 
single ranked team on the road.

While the records don’t favor 

Harbaugh, any critics claiming 
he should be on the hot seat are 
starting rumors that are unlikely 
to merit any truth.

It’s hard to imagine Harbaugh 

going anywhere else in the near 
future, because he hasn’t even 
had a chance to see his own 
recruits flesh out completely.

In 
2018, 
players 
like 

sophomore 
linebacker 
Devin 

Bush and sophomore defensive 

end Rashan Gary — two of 
Michigan’s best — will be the 
faces of the team. On offense, 
redshirt 
freshman 
Brandon 

Peters have several more games 
under his belt and likely be the 
one leading the charge.

As the seniors and fifth-years 

that stuck around from the 
Brady Hoke era fade out of the 
program, Harbaugh’s guys will 
take over.

If the team can’t perform 

better next year, though, then 
the Harbaugh haters might have 
a point worth listening to.

4. 
Bold 
prediction: 
It’ll 

happen next year.

Give Peters, or maybe even 

Dylan 
McCaffrey, 
the 
ball 

against 
the 
Buckeyes, 
and 

the Wolverines should have 
a 
chance. 
The 
quarterback 

situation cost Michigan the 
game this weekend, but if Peters 
has another year to develop and 
grow, he could be the difference-
maker the Wolverines needs.

Elsewhere on the field, not 

much is going to change.

The run game will stay strong 

with Evans and Higdon, and 
young wide receivers like Tarik 
Black and Donovan Peoples-
Jones should improve as well.

The biggest two offensive 

losses 
are 
fifth-year 
senior 

fullback 
Khalid 
Hill 
and 

senior left tackle Mason Cole. 
Michigan’s offensive line will 
have to improve without Cole, 
its best and most consistent 
player for the last few years, but 
if it can, a lot will open up for the 
Wolverines’ offense.

The defense should continue 

to excel. Michigan’s top-ranked 
pass defense likely won’t lose 
anybody, and the linebacker 
situation should be fine as well 
— even without fifth-year senior 
Mike McCray.

Losing 
fifth-year 
senior 

defensive 
tackle 
Maurice 

Hurst 
will 
hurt, 
but 
if 

defensive 
coordinator 
Don 

Brown continues to develop 
his aggressive unit, Michigan 
should be fine there as well.

So, is a road win in Columbus 

possible? It’s certainly going to 
be difficult, but it’s absolutely 
possible.

FOOTBALL
Speight announces he 
will transfer for 2018

Wilton Speight announced 

Sunday afternoon that he will 
be transferring from Michigan.

Speight, currently a redshirt 

junior, will have one year of 
eligibility remaining. He will 
also be able to play immediately 
at whichever school he chooses 
as a graduate transfer.

The move will leave the 

Wolverines 
with 
three 

scholarship 
quarterbacks 
on 

next year’s roster: redshirt 
freshman 
Brandon 
Peters, 

freshman 
Dylan 
McCaffrey 

and 
redshirt 
sophomore 

Alex 
Malzone. 
Michigan 

currently has two quarterbacks 
committed 
in 
the 
2018 

recruiting class in four-star 
Joe 
Milton 
and 
three-star 

Kevin Doyle. Both would be 
true freshmen next year if 
they follow through with their 
verbal commitments.

As for Speight, he’s currently 

unaware of where he’ll finish 
his career. 

“I don’t know where next 

will be, and I’ll use these next 
four weeks to figure that out,” 
Speight wrote on Instagram. 
“I’m excited to keep pursuing 
my dreams in a new jersey, but 
will forever root for the boys 
wearing the winged helmet.”

In 16 starts over his four-year 

career at Michigan, Speight 
tallied a 13-3 record, 3,119 
passing yards, 21 touchdowns 
and nine interceptions.

It was a career that began 

rather inconspicuously. Speight, 
recruited by former head coach 
Brady Hoke, redshirted his first 
year. After a year of anonymity, 
he featured in an HBO special 
covering a newly-hired Jim 
Harbaugh.

And in that moment, it didn’t 

seem like Speight had earned 
Harbaugh’s favor.

“I’m just telling you the right 

way to do it,” Harbaugh said in 
that episode. “If you want to 
look at me with that look, go 

(expletive) look it somewhere 
else.”

But 
Speight 
would 
stick 

things out and find his way 
back into his head coach’s good 
graces.

First he beat out John O’Korn 

and Shane Morris in a heated 
competition for the starting job. 
Then he led last year’s team to 
a 9-0 start, at one point during 
which Harbaugh said Speight 
deserved consideration for the 
Heisman Trophy.

“It’s time to throw his hat 

into the ring,” Harbaugh said 
after Speight threw for a career-
high 362 yards in a 59-3 win 
over Maryland on Nov. 5, 2016.

Things fell apart late for 

Michigan — and Speight — that 
year, though. In a 14-13 loss 
to Iowa, Speight was dealt a 
heavy blow. He missed the next 
week’s game with an injury. 
He returned for the final two 
games of the year, both of which 
the Wolverines lost late.

It was a rough ending to a 

season that began with so much 
promise.

Despite 
challenges 
from 

Brandon Peters and O’Korn, 
Speight held onto his job this 
offseason with relative ease. 
And as one of the lone holdovers 
from last year’s veteran-laden 
team, Speight was looked upon 
to help Michigan transition to 
this year’s more youthful squad.

But that transition would 

prove difficult.

In 2017, Speight struggled to 

replicate the success he had his 
first year as a starter. Through 
four games, he completed just 
54.3 percent of his passes for 7.17 
yards per attempt with a 121.9 
quarterback rating — numbers 
that were all down from his first 
season as a starter.

Then, 
against 
Purdue, 

Speight took a big hit that broke 
three of his vertebrae. That 
injury would knock him out for 
the rest of the regular season. 
And with Sunday’s news, that 
will the last time Speight puts 
on a Michigan jersey.

Reality check

T

he sobering reality was 
clear well before Ohio State 
scored just prior to the final 

horn to cap off a brutal weekend for 
the Michigan hockey team.

This reality was especially 

sobering because it was a new 
one. For 
two straight 
nights, the 
Wolverines 
had been 
dominated in 
every facet of 
the game and 
run off their 
home ice. 
They didn’t 
try to deny it, 
either.

“Overall, it just came down to 

outworking us,” said sophomore 
forward Jake Slaker. “All weekend 
they outworked us, all six periods.”

Michigan coach Mel Pearson 

employed his own analogy.

“The makeup came off and 

we saw a lot of the blemishes this 
weekend,” Pearson said. “We were 
able to cover some things up, (but) 
this weekend we saw a little bit of 
some of the issues that we’re going 
to have going forward.”

As it turns out, the Wolverines 

had been applying plenty of 
makeup. And the Buckeyes were 
well-equipped to wash it off.

Some of Michigan’s blemishes 

were more obvious than others. 
The Wolverines haven’t allowed 
less than three goals in a contest 
since Nov. 2 against Ferris State. 
After this weekend, they rank 55th 
in the country in goals-against per 
game.

Pearson believed his maligned 

defense took steps forward “for 
two and a half periods” in Friday’s 
3-2 defeat. But the unit seemed to 
take those same steps backward a 
night later. Sloppy clearances and 
giveaways deep in the defensive 
zone have hurt Michigan all 
season. They were responsible for 
Ohio State’s second goal Saturday, 
when junior defenseman Nicholas 
Boka lost the puck behind his own 
net, and nearly resulted in multiple 
goals in the first period.

Prior to this weekend, the 

Wolverines were able to, in 
Pearson’s words, “outscore our 

mistakes.” That wouldn’t be the 
case — and wasn’t — against the 
Buckeyes, who have allowed the 
second-fewest goals and seventh-
fewest shots on goal per game in 
the nation.

A 5-4 or 6-6 slugfest — scores 

that Michigan has seen plenty 
of this year — wasn’t expected 
this weekend. And it’d be 
unfair to judge the Wolverines’ 
offense entirely on its last two 
performances.

But that doesn’t mean there 

weren’t flaws — lack of depth 
key among them. Michigan had 
been relying too heavily on junior 
forward Cooper Marody and senior 
forward Tony Calderone, who had 
combined for half of the team’s 
points last weekend at Wisconsin. 
Marody saw his eight-game multi-
point streak come to an end as he 
was kept off the stat sheet Friday, 
and the pair registered just two 
assists against the Buckeyes.

“They took Cooper’s time and 

space away, made it tough on those 
guys and we just couldn’t step up,” 
Pearson said. “And that’s what 
we’re asking from some other 
guys to get opportunities to give us 
some depth, and we haven’t taken 
advantage of that. That’s going to 
continue to be an issue, so we’re 
going to have to move some things 

around.”

If there’s any silver lining to the 

Wolverines’ showing this weekend, 
it’s probably the fact that it took 
place when it did, as they don’t 
have an official game this week. 
This gives Michigan a needed 
opportunity to try to shore up its 
numerous problems — a “good 
work-week” according to Pearson. 
Pearson even mentioned the idea of 
shaking up the top line of Marody, 
Calderone and senior forward 
Dexter Dancs, a line which had 
been so potent earlier in the season.

“They’ve been going pretty 

good,” Pearson said. “But you get to 
a point — you can’t break them up 
when they’re rolling, so this might 
be a good chance to experiment 
and see where we’re at.”

Sitting in the media room at 

Yost Ice Arena after Saturday’s 
defeat, Slaker was asked if his team 
could take away anything from the 
weekend, when taking the parallels 
between last year’s Michigan 
team and this year’s outfit into 
consideration.

“I don’t know if we can really 

compare last season and this 
season,” he replied. “I think it’s 
totally different teams.”

Of course, Slaker’s correct. 

These Wolverines are vastly 
different in terms of coaching, 

playing style and identity.

They’re different in terms of 

caliber, too. Pearson stated at 
Michigan’s media day that if he 
was a forecaster, he would pick 
the Wolverines — who won just 
13 games last season — to win the 
Big Ten. That was a much bolder 
prediction before they split with 
then-No. 15 Penn State in Happy 
Valley and recorded a win and a tie 
against then-No. 4 Minnesota.

But despite all of the concrete 

progress made, a good number of 
cracks were glossed over.

Certainly, there are three 

months of hockey left to be played. 
And a team in serious contention 
for a conference title is entitled to a 
rough couple games at some point.

But if the Wolverines truly are a 

Big Ten contender, as they believe 
they are, they’ll have to prove 
that those couple games were an 
exception rather than the rule. 
All of Michigan’s deficiencies this 
season were in full form against 
Ohio State, and those deficiencies 
manifested into a harsh wake-up 
call.

Cold reality hit this weekend, 

and the Wolverines weren’t ready.

MEN’S BASKETBALL
Wagner, Matthews 
building chemistry

It’s becoming a theme for the 

Michigan men’s basketball team. 

Junior 
forward 
Moritz 

Wagner and redshirt sophomore 
forward 
Charles 
Matthews 

have mostly led the way for the 
Wolverines.

That was most evident in 

Michigan’s 87-42 drubbing of 
UC-Riverside on Sunday, and it 
started early in the game.

Wagner 
scored 
the 

Wolverines’ first three baskets, 
drilling a three, a midrange 
jumper and a layup – with the last 
two coming on Matthews assists. 
Then Matthews threw down a 
dunk, and away the Wolverines 
went. Both players finished with 
double-doubles. Matthews had 
17 points and 12 assists, while 
Wagner added 21 points and 10 
rebounds.

As Michigan’s most talented 

scorers, the duo often uses the 
pick-and-roll to get open looks 
for one another. After setting 
screens, Wagner gets his points 
by rolling to the hoop or popping 
to the three-point line, and 
Matthews gets his by pulling up 
for a jumper or turning the corner 
off and attacking the basket after 
coming off a screen.

The pick-and-roll continued 

to work on Sunday as four of 
Wagner’s first seven points came 
off the duo’s bread and butter. 
Matthews came off a screen from 
Wagner, drew a double team and 
fed the popping Wagner on the 
baseline. He hit the open jumper. 
Moments later, after setting an 
off-ball screen, Matthews drew 
another double team and found 
Wagner again. The junior spun 
and laid the ball gently into the 
hoop.

It’s a simple play, but to perfect 

it, the two needed time to learn 
each other’s games.

“We played with each other so 

much over the summer, in open 
gyms,” Matthews said. “So we 
just said we knew that we were 

going to be key components to 
this team and we wanted to get 
our chemistry down with one 
another.”

Added Wagner: “It’s still a 

work in progress, I think, … 
trying to figure out tendencies 
with each other, and there’s still 
some issues here and there. But 
I think we’re doing a really good 
job figuring it out right now, and 
now is a really good time to figure 
it out.”

For Wagner, there was an 

expectation 
of 
excellence 

entering 
this 
season. 
For 

Matthews, 
it 
would 
be 

understandable if he was rusty. 
After all, he hasn’t really played 
important minutes in two years.

But Matthews blew up in the 

Wolverines’ 
exhibition 
game 

against Grand Valley, and he has 
continued to build on that, scoring 
20 points in three of seven games. 
With that, expectations have 
risen to, and possibly exceeded, 
those of Wagner.

“(Matthews) never had to 

make decisions at Kentucky,” said 
Michigan coach John Beilein. 
“But the year that he was able to 
redshirt with us … he worked so 
hard on his game to get better. 
Now, the lights come on, and now 
he’s got to do it in real time. And 
(he’s) just learning. I mean, he’s 
a very young player with huge 
potential.”

So far, Matthews has proven 

he can produce in game action. 
His 
performance 
Sunday 
is 

an example of his burgeoning 
confidence on the court. Wagner 
has been right alongside him, 
averaging 6.9 more points per 
game and 5.3 more rebounds per 
game than he was at this point 
last season.

As 
the 
season 
progresses, 

perhaps 
Matthews 
and 

Wagner’s successes will open up 
opportunities for players around 
them. But for now, with games 
against the likes of North Carolina, 
UCLA and Texas coming up, the 
duo’s upward trend has surfaced 
at the right time. 

The good, the bad and the ugly: No. 8 Ohio State

“It would make the season, you 

know? This is what we play for — to 
beat Ohio State.”

That was what Michigan’s Noah 

Furbush said last Tuesday, just four 
days before The Game.

Everyone knows it, from the 

players and coaches. The season is 
a disappointment if the Wolverines 
don’t beat the Buckeyes. And by 
that metric, for the 13th time in 14 
years, Michigan’s season can be 
considered a disappointment after a 
31-20 loss.

And that’ll hurt Michigan even 

more given how close it was to 
making its season.

The Daily breaks down the good, 

the bad and the ugly from Saturday’s 
game.

The good
Michigan’s coaching staff pulled 

out all the tricks for this one. The 
Wolverines attacked the Buckeyes 
with multiple new formations, 
keeping Ohio State’s defense off-
balanced and confused. It was 
exactly what an underdog has to do 
to have a chance against a superior 
team, and for a while, things were 
working in Michigan’s favor.

The Wolverines fired off a 

13-play, 77-yard drive that tied for 
their longest touchdown drive of the 
season. A nifty play-action pass near 
the goal-line to Sean McKeon gave 
Michigan a 14-point lead. Later, a 
quick outside screen to Kekoa 
Crawford gained 43 yards, setting 
the Wolverines up for another 
touchdown.

Michigan got several stellar 

individual performances, as well. 
Chris Evans carried the ball 11 times 
for 67 yards, with several impressive 
runs that featured multiple broken 
tackles. Rashan Gary tallied 10 
tackles, three tackles for loss and 
two sacks, while Chase Winovich 
added nine tackles, 1.5 tackles for 
loss and one sack of his own. The 
pair anchored a defense that held 
its own for much of the game. Ohio 
State, in fact, had negative-seven 
total yards after the first quarter — 
the fewest after any quarter during 

Urban Meyer’s tenure.

Michigan was clearly ready 

to battle. But the highlights were 
outnumbered by the miscues.

The bad
The Wolverines have done a poor 

job of protecting their quarterback 
this year. As Wilton Speight and 
Brandon Peters stood on the sideline, 
both 
injured 
and 
spectating, 

Michigan struggled once again 
in pass protection. The Buckeyes 
tallied numerous pressures, racked 
up five sacks and in general, made 
life difficult for John O’Korn.

O’Korn, of course, didn’t make 

life easy for himself either.

He missed several throws in 

the first half. On the first drive, 
Michigan called a delayed route for 
Tyrone Wheatley Jr. in the middle 
of the field. Wheatley had acres of 
green turf in front of him. O’Korn 
simply missed him, and on came the 
punt team.

Then 
there 
was 
the 
late 

interception that came on the very 
first play of Michigan’s penultimate 
drive. At that point, the Wolverines 
had hope: they just had to move the 
ball 77 yards in 2:47. Difficult, but 
certainly achievable.

O’Korn, though, misread the 

coverage, Jordan Fuller recorded 
the easiest interception of his life 
and that was it.

To add further insult, Ohio 

State’s offense came on the field and 
shredded a deflated defense for one 
final touchdown.

The ugly
The coaching staff and players 

probably reviewed yesterday’s tape 
with thoughts of what could have 
been. For all the scheming that went 
into this week’s gameplan, there 
were simply too many mistakes.

The miscues began on offense, 

where the Wolverines continually 
left yards and points on the table 
thanks to simple mistakes. There 
was a fumbled snap. There was 
a botched handoff on which 
the quarterback got stepped on, 
tripped and fell down. That turned 
a 
manageable 
2nd-and-1 
into 

3rd-and-4. Two incompletions later, 
and the Wolverines had squandered 
a golden opportunity in Buckeye 

territory to win the game.

Earlier in the third quarter, 

Maurice 
Hurst 
made 
an 

uncharacteristic 
mistake. 
The 

fifth-year senior defensive tackle 
has been Michigan’s best player 
on defense all year. He’s one of the 
best players in the country. But on a 
2nd-and-7, he failed to keep contain 
while stunting — and that allowed 
Dwayne Haskins to scamper easily 
for 22 yards.

That 
entire 
drive 
was 
a 

backbreaker. After watching Ohio 
State’s J.T. Barrett exit with an 
injury, the Wolverines promptly 
gave 
up 
a 
time-consuming 

touchdown drive to his backup, 
who converted several tough third 
downs and marched his team down 
the field with ease. A J.K. Dobbins 
touchdown gave the Buckeyes their 
first lead of the game — a lead they 
would not relinquish.

Michigan 
might 
not 
have 

even been in that situation had it 
built on its quick start. Had Josh 
Metellus held onto the ball after 
Barrett threw it directly at him, the 
Wolverines might be celebrating 
their first win over Ohio State since 
2011. But the ball tumbled to the 
turf, Barrett strolled into the end 
zone just a few plays later and the 
Buckeyes’ comeback was on.

Those are all ‘what-ifs’ the 

Wolverines will be thinking about 
for the next year. And it seems that 
every year, that’s what Michigan is 
left to think about — what might, or 
could, happen in the next matchup.

That’s simply what happens 

when mistakes pile up — you lose, 
and then you’re left contemplating 
what could have been. For the 
Wolverines, that holds doubly true 
considering those mistakes came 
against Ohio State of all teams.

‘M’ tops UC Riverside

For the time being, the starting 

point guard spot is Eli Brooks’ to 
lose.

Just over four minutes into 

Sunday afternoon’s game, UC 
Riverside’s Dikymbe Martin drove 
towards the hoop and before 
the basketball could grace the 
backboard, it was met by the hand 
of Brooks.

The freshman point guard 

corralled the ball and charged to the 
other end, dishing it in the corner to 
fifth-year senior forward Duncan 
Robinson for a transition 3-pointer.

Two possessions later, Brooks 

was left alone in the corner for his 
first shot of the game. Splash.

“He makes the other four guys 

better right now. It’s that simple,” 
said Michigan coach John Beilein. 
“He just makes the other four guys 
better. … He seems to be what I 
call a ‘quick study,’ a guy that as 
we continue to go game to game to 
game that he can make really good 
changes.”

Brooks’ play was the type of 

smooth, intelligent performance 
expected from a starting point 
guard, as he finished with eight 
points and four rebounds. And the 
outing kickstarted the trajectory of 
the Michigan men’s basketball team 
87-42 drubbing of the Highlanders 
(2-3).

“Obviously we took the loss to 

LSU by two. We didn’t play the 
game we were capable of playing,” 
said freshman guard Jordan Poole. 
“Obviously we started getting on 
a stretch against Chaminade and 
VCU. Today we were getting to 
play comfortable, not thinking too 
much. … We’re just kinda out there 
just flowing.”

The first half was as clean 

of basketball as the Wolverines 
(6-1) have played all season. They 
assisted on their first 10 baskets, and 
held the advantage in nearly every 
category for a 41-17 halftime edge.

Perhaps the most promising sign 

gleaned from the first 20 minutes 
was the Matthews-Wagner pick-

and-roll 
combination. 
Wagner 

scored the contest’s first seven 
points in every way he knows how: 
a top-of-the-key trey, a mid-range 
corner jumper and a spin move to 
the basket for an easy layup.

For Matthews, it didn’t take long 

for him to set a career-high in assists. 
After dishing out a previous best of 
four assists against Chaminade last 
Tuesday, the redshirt sophomore 
forward needed just over seven 
minutes to notch five.

The second half offered much 

of the same. Wagner scored 
Michigan’s first five points — eight 
of its first 12 — and Matthews had 
three assists in the first five minutes. 
Matthews’ 12 total assists and 17 
points gave him his second career 
double-double, also his second in 
three games. Wagner also tallied a 
double-double with 21 points and 10 
boards.

“When you have a good game we 

know that there will probably be a 
bad game or worse game as well,” 
Wagner said. “… We can see it every 
day. We know that with this offense 
and the way we play and the type of 
players we have, it allows us to have 
good players every game that are 
different.”

While 
the 
all-around 

contributions were a welcome 
sign for the Wolverines, it doesn’t 
make Beilein’s job any easier. 
He 
has 
consistently 
stressed 

the importance of trimming the 
rotation down to eight or nine 
players, while all 16 players saw the 
court on Sunday.

“I’m seeing who’s gonna grow 

now. I’m seeing who’s gonna grow 
the fastest,” Beilein said. “... That’s 
up for grabs, and it’s still up for 
grabs. It will be every game. I’m 
just gonna go ‘Who practiced well? 
Alright, you practiced well. Go in.’ ”

The Wolverines can rest easy 

tonight about their lopsided win 
over UC Riverside, but they will 
have to put it in the past quickly. 
A date with No. 9 North Carolina 
awaits 
on 
Wednesday, 
and 

compared to the Highlanders, the 
two matchups are apples to oranges 
for Michigan.

4B — Monday, November 27, 2017
SportsMonday
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Chase Winovich reached out 

at the air, grabbing at something 
that wasn’t quite concrete and 
had already passed him by.

He spoke in platitudes of just 

how close the Wolverines were to 
finally beating Ohio State. Except 
this time, they weren’t really 
platitudes at all. Michigan really 
could touch victory, and actually 
could taste it.

But in the end, he was left 

standing in front of the media, 
holding back tears, forced to 
reduce a loss to the Buckeyes to 
the simplest of expressions.

“It’s tough.”
Perhaps 
it’s 
even 
tougher 

because of Winovich’s own self-
admission.

“At the end of the day, it’s on 

us,” he said. “People love to point 
fingers at the offense and say this 
or that. But we had a lead. They 
don’t score, they don’t win.”

Sometimes it’s that simple. 

Michigan didn’t have only one 
lead 
over 
the 
ninth-ranked 

Buckeyes on Saturday. It had two.

The first, of course, was larger. 

The Wolverines came out firing, 
putting 14 points on the board in 
the first quarter.

The second came later, with 

just over seven minutes left in the 
third quarter.

Sandwiched 
in 
between 

were mistakes — ones that 
are uncharacteristic for this 
Michigan defense, but ones it is 
not immune to.

Perhaps the most troubling 

part, 
though, 
is 
that 
those 

mistakes 
weren’t 
necessarily 

forced.

Rashan Gary said that Ohio 

State didn’t do anything special. 
He said Michigan didn’t see 
anything that it hadn’t already 
seen during practice. And fifth-
year senior linebacker Mike 
McCray echoed that sentiment.

“We didn’t execute,” McCray 

said. “The touchdown (that) the 
tight end caught up the middle, it 
was on us … made a mistake, and 
they took advantage of it. If we 
wouldn’t have made a mistake, he 
wouldn’t have been wide open. 
Maybe he wouldn’t have scored. 
Maybe we would’ve held them to 
a field goal.”

The 
touchdown 
McCray 

is referring to, of course, was 
Marcus Baugh’s.

With just under six minutes 

remaining 
in 
the 
second 

quarter, quarterback J.T. Barrett 
took the snap on 1st-and-10 
from Michigan’s 25-yard line. 
Sophomore 
VIPER 
Khaleke 

Hudson misread the run-pass 
option, and Baugh was the 

beneficiary — catching a pass up 
the seam to tie the game at 14.

And as for the rest of McCray’s 

comments, 
‘maybe’ 
is 
the 

operative word — because the 
game was full of opportunities to 
use it.

Maybe 
if 
Josh 
Metellus 

accepted Barrett’s gift of an 
interception 
in 
the 
second 

quarter, the Buckeyes would 
have never sparked a 14-point 
comeback.

Maybe if the Wolverines kept 

Mike Weber out of the end zone 
at the end of the fourth quarter, 
John O’Korn would have had one 
final opportunity to redeem his 
previous interception.

Maybe if Michigan didn’t allow 

Ohio State to convert eight of its 
16 third-down conversions, the 
result would have been different.

But none of those things 

happened, and no game can 
really be reduced to a single play.

Winovich, then, summed it up 

best. If the Buckeyes don’t score, 
they don’t win. Instead, they did 
both.

The result? You could see it all 

across the team.

As the fans headed for the 

exits after Weber’s proverbial 
dagger, Hudson came off the field 
and threw his helmet. Then he 
whipped a towel at the bench, 
and sat down with his head on 
his chest.

When Mike McCray was asked 

what Jim Harbaugh’s message 
was after the game, he admitted 
that he didn’t know because he 
was crying too hard.

Rashan Gary — he was in 

tears too, watching his fifth-
year senior quarterback choke 
out the admission that he feels 
responsible for a repeat of this 
rivalry’s recent history.

And 
Chase 
Winovich, 
he 

reached out at the air, grabbing 
at something that wasn’t quite 
concrete and had already passed 
him by.

Buckeyes prove too much for Michigan in ‘The Game’

‘M’ defense surrenders two leads in heartbreaking loss
Fifth-year seniors fail to top Ohio State once again

John O’Korn sat at the podium 

in the postgame press conference 
and broke down in tears.

The 
fifth-year 
senior 

quarterback tried to compose 
himself, but his voice cracked as the 
words came out.

“The hardest part for me is that 

you come here to win this game,” 
he said. “And our senior class 
wasn’t able to do it.”

Saturday, the Michigan football 

team lost to Ohio State for the sixth 
consecutive time. Even in five years 
as a Wolverine, O’Korn was unable 
to come away with arguably the 
most important victory.

He isn’t alone in that regard. 

Linebacker 
Mike 
McCray, 

defensive tackle Maurice Hurst, 
center Patrick Kugler and fullback 
Khalid Hill have also spent five 
years on the sidelines of Michigan 
Stadium and Ohio Stadium, yet 
they have never come away with 
the elusive win.

There was the five-point loss in 

2012, and then the one-point loss 
in 2013. There was the double-digit 
loss in 2014, and then the blowout 
in 2015. There was the overtime 
loss in 2016, and now, another game 
that will be written in rivalry lore.

Michigan — unranked and 

with an 8-3 overall record — once 
had a 14-point lead over the ninth-
ranked, Big Ten championship 
game-bound Buckeyes. And yet, 
when all was said and done, the 
Wolverines lost by 11.

“I wish we could have won, wish 

we could have sent the seniors 
out with a victory,” said Michigan 
coach Jim Harbaugh. “They gave 
it everything they had and played 
extremely hard. ... Great bunch of 
guys to coach, great character guys, 
so it’s disappointing.”

It started with the defense, 

which forced three straight three-
and-outs in the first quarter to yield 
negative yardage from Ohio State’s 

prolific offense. McCray dropped 
quarterback J.T. Barrett for a loss 
on the Buckeyes’ first play of the 
game, and then combined with 
Hurst to stop running back J.K. 
Dobbins for a short gain.

The offense took it from there. 

On Michigan’s opening scoring 
drive, Hill converted a crucial 
first down and then punched it 
into the end zone. On its second, 
the Wolverines were gifted field 
possession by freshman receiver 
Donovan 
Peoples-Jones, 
who 

returned a punt all the way to Ohio 
State’s 11-yard line. O’Korn finished 
it off, finding sophomore tight end 
Sean McKeon over the middle.

At that point, Michigan had the 

Buckeyes where it wanted them. 
The Wolverines held the ball for 10 
minutes, while the Buckeyes did for 
just four.

They could have kept the 

momentum swinging firmly in 
their favor. They could have run 
away with the game.

McCray said the Buckeyes were 

doing everything they expected 
them to, but, according to O’Korn, 
Michigan took its foot off the gas. It 
cost the Wolverines dearly.

In the second quarter, Ohio State 

won the possession battle, nine to 
six, and found the end zone twice 
in just four minutes. Suddenly, the 
game was tied.

“It’s kind of hard to stay hot as an 

offense when you’re not on the field 
as much,” Hill said. “Ohio State 
did a great job of keeping us off the 
field. We were hot, we would have 
scored lots of points I feel like.”

But Michigan scored just six 

points the rest of the way. After 
letting the Buckeyes back into the 
game, the Wolverines couldn’t 
keep up with them and suffered yet 
another rivalry loss.

Michigan had one more chance 

to change its fate late in the game. 
Already inside their 30-yard line, 
the 
Wolverines’ 
defense 
held 

Ohio State to a field goal, and the 
Buckeyes’ 
kicker 
subsequently 

missed wide left.

Down just four points with 2:47 

left to play, Michigan needed a 
touchdown.

But on the very first play 

of the drive, O’Korn threw an 
interception to seal the Wolverines’ 
fate: another loss to Ohio State.

“I hold myself responsible for 

a lot of that, and it sucks,” O’Korn 
continued. “I can’t imagine a worse 
feeling right now.”

Then he stood up slowly with his 

head hung low and walked out of 
the room.

It was his last game at Michigan 

Stadium and his final game against 
Ohio State, as it was for McCray, 
Hill and the rest.

The Wolverines lost ‘The Game,’ 

and there was nothing else to say.
