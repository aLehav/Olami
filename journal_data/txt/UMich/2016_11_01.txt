Detroit-based 
bakery 

Avalon International Breads is 
expanding outside the city by 
opening a brand new cafe in 
downtown Ann Arbor.

The bakery closed a deal last 

Monday to secure the location 
of 
the 
former 
Mezzevino 

Mediterranean Kitchen and 
Bar on 129 E. Liberty St.

The retail bakery will be 

named Avalon Hearth and 
Soul Café and is on track to be 
open by the end of this year.

University of Michigan alum 

Jackie Victor, co-founder and 
CEO of Avalon International 
Breads, said 60 percent of her 

wholesale market — including 
Arbor Farms Market, People’s 
Food Co-op, Plum Market and 
Whole Foods — comes from 
Ann Arbor, and her roots here 
that were an influence for 
opening a cafe.

“When I was a student at the 

University of Michigan, it was 
where I originally got the idea 
for a bakery, because I used 
to volunteer — periodically, 
not on a regular basis — at a 
co-op bakery called Wildflour 
Bakery,” Victor said. “Working 
at Wildflour was a really 
powerful way to see how a 
small space like that could 
really create a lot of warmth 
in a community, plus provide 
something that was healthy 

Students for Hillary held 

a “Why #ImWithHer” event 
on the Diag at the University 
of Michigan on Monday — 
just one of the events held 
in 
support 
of 
Democratic 

presidential nominee Hillary 
Clinton in anticipation of 
Election Day.

The group set up a table 

and asked students passing by 
to take photos with a cutout 
of Clinton and state why 
they were supporting her in 
the 
upcoming 
presidential 

election.

With the election just one 

week away, club members 
said they want to both spread 
word about the election and 
encourage students to vote 
for Clinton, as well as show 
support for the nominee on 
social media. LSA freshman 
Suraj Sorab, a member of 
the 
Students 
for 
Hillary 

leadership team, said the club 
is increasing its efforts in the 
final week leading up to the 
election.

“The election is coming 

up next week and we wanted 
to make sure that in terms of 
‘get out the vote’ that we are 
coming upon making sure that 
people are voting for Clinton,” 
Sorab said. “We chose the 
Diag because it is very public 
and we want to make sure that 
we can get Hillary Clinton 
into office.”

In 
addition 
to 
today’s 

Diag event, the University’s 
chapter of College Democrats 
canvassed 
with 
Clinton’s 

campaign in East Lansing 
during the Saturday football 
game between Michigan and 
Michigan State as part of a 
competition between the two 
schools to recruit the most 
volunteers.

Along 
with 
a 
final 

campaign push prior to the 

election, many groups were 
active in voter registration 
prior to the Oct. 11 deadline. 
Now, organizations at the 
University 
continue 
to 

raise 
awareness 
through 

demonstrations on the Diag 
and 
watch 
parties 
during 

presidential debates.

Sorab 
said 
after 
the 

registration deadline passed 
the focus switched to keeping 
voters aware of the upcoming 

election date.

“While voter registration 

was still open we were out 
trying to get people to register 
to vote so we can mobilize as 
many voters as possible for 
Clinton — even though we 
registered anyone regardless 
of 
who 
they 
supported,” 

Sorab said. “Now that the 
registration is over, our focus 
is in sending out emails and 

For the second time in two 

days, University of Michigan 
Department of Public Safety and 
Security officers were called to 
the Diag Monday night to respond 
to student concerns about a man 
seen carrying an Islamic State 
flag and dressed in a thwab, a 
traditional Arab garment.

The man was first seen and 

approached by the police Sunday 
night.

The man, an Ann Arbor resident 

who only gave his first name, 
Carlos, said he was wearing the 
clothing as a costume. He noted he 
did not have any identifiers saying 
he was a Muslim on his clothing 
so passersby should not assume 
he is of the faith, adding that 
he considers himself a theocrat 
— a person who governs as a 
representative of a religious deity.

“This is my Halloween costume; 

I thought it was provocative,” 
Carlos said. “I decided to wear 
it because I thought it would be 
provocative and I was hoping that 
it would start an honest discussion 
about ideas.”

He added that he hoped to

University President Mark Schlissel speaks at a Senate Advisory Committee on University Affairs meeting in the Fleming Building Monday.

posters

around

Advisory 
Committee 
on 

University

Tuesday, 
praising

Faculty

also 

expressed concerns about the 
recently

University 

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
plan, with some characterizing it 

as a quota system for increasing 
diversity.

In response to the poster 

incidents, Schlissel said he felt 
reassured by the number of 
faculty — including members of 
SACUA — he saw take action, 
calling 
the 
posters 
“overtly 

racist and pretty disgusting.” 

He encouraged an open dialogue 
among committee members on 
how he can increase campus 
engagement 
between 
faculty 

and students.

As Detroit city official Carol 

O’Cleireacain was wrapping up 
a lecture Monday on the fiscal 
future of the city, a University 
of Michigan student and Detroit 
resident said during a Q and A 
he felt the official’s description 
of Detroit was offensive and 
inacurate — pointing to her 
comment calling Detroit a “rich 
public policy laboratory” for 
students in Ann Arbor.

O’Cleireacain, 
Detroit’s

and

“A 
laboratory 
is 
not 

necessarily 
an 
experiment,” 

O’Cleireacain said in response 
to Public Policy junior Stephen 
Wallace.

The lecture was sponsored 

by the Ford School of Public 
Policy’s 
Center 
for

State and Urban Policy, and

With Election Day one week 

away and many University of 

Michigan students voting in 

what is most likely their first 

presidential race, many campus 

organizations are holding 

events for students to engage 

with their fellow classmates in 

conversation about their beliefs 

and what they think the most 

important issues will be in the 

next four years. 

Events slated to occur in 

the next eight days include 

Issues & Ale: Election Night 

Viewing Party, a screening of 

the documentary “Bring it to 

the Table” and a election night 

results watch party hosted by 

the Ginsberg Center.

Before the big day, the 

documentary “Bring It to the 

Table” by filmmaker Julie 

Winokur will be screened 

Thursday at the Ford School of 

Public Policy Auditorium from 

6:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. The film 

captures dialogues from citizens 

in diverse neighborhoods across 

the country who speak about 

politics and how it affects them.

Issues & Ale — hosted by 

the Ford School of Public Policy 

and Michigan Radio — is an 

election night viewing party at 

Fraser’s Pub. Attendees will be 

able to engage in political trivia 

and analyze the election results 

with the help of Michigan Radio 

Stateside podcast host Cynthia 

Canty and a panel of experts.

Additionally, several campus 

groups will host another 

election night watch party 

in the Rogel Ballroom at the 

Michigan Union Tuesday at 8:30 

p.m.

This event’s website 

encourages students to “get 

a healthy dose of democratic 

engagement” by joining fellow 

students in non-partisan debate 

and results watch parties, which 

are co-hosted by the Center for 

Campus Involvement and the 

Edward Ginsberg Center for 

Community Service Learning.

All University dining halls 

will also be making a special 

Election Day breakfast on 

Tuesday.

After resigning as county 

commissioner amid concerns 
of a conflict of interest, then 
abruptly re-entering a election 
race 
for 
the 
seat, 
Conan 

Smith (D–District 9) is facing 
widespread disaffection from 
segments of his constituency.

However, even some of his 

critics admit it will be unlikely 
for him to lose re-election 
because of the amount of 
straight-ticket 
Democratic 

voting expected on Election 
Day.

Smith 
originally 
resigned 

as commissioner in August 
followed 
Mary 
Morgan, 

former publisher of the Ann 
Arbor Chronicle and executive 
director 
of 
the 
CivCity 

Initiative, a nonprofit based 
in Ann Arbor dedicated to 

increasing civic engagement 
in the community, sent a letter 
to the Board of Commissioners 
alerting 
them 
that 
Smith’s 

pursuit of a job as director of the 
county’s Office of Community 
and 
Economic 
Development 

represented 
a 
conflict 
of 

interest. Commissioners have 
the potential to influence the 
hiring decisions of the county’s 
full-time staff.

Because Smith’s resignation 

came after the July deadline 
to withdraw from the ballot 
and followed his victory in 
his 
uncontested 
Democratic 

primary 
election, 
it 
was 

too late for others to file for 
independent 
or 
Republican 

campaigns 
against 
him 
on 

the November ballot, though 
several individuals have chosen 
to run as write-in candidates.

Citing 
the 
controversy 

surrounding his pursuit of the 
county job, Smith took himself 

out of consideration for the 
OCED position on Oct. 13 and 
stated his intention to pursue 
re-election as commissioner of 
his district instead.

He 
faces 
a 
write-in 

challenge 
from 
public 

relations 
professional 
Jen 

Eyer (D–District 9) — who was 
appointed to serve as interim 
commissioner following Smith’s 
departure — as well as several 
other candidates. Only Smith’s 
name will be on next Tuesday’s 
ballot.

In 
an 
interview, 
Smith 

pointed out that he did not 
violate any state guidelines, 
saying he sought the OCED job 
to better the living conditions of 
county residents. He compared 
his pursuit of an administrative 
position in a body he represents 
as 
an 
elected 
official 
to 

Democratic 
presidential 

nominee 
Hillary 
Clinton’s 

choice to accept a nomination 
to be Secretary of State while a 
U.S. senator.

“I took an extraordinary 

step in resigning my seat in 
order to make sure there was 
no even potential conflict of 
interest. I was doing extra 
work to ensure that the ethical 
standards that our community 
holds were adhered to,” Smith 
said. “It happens all through 
government, you see people 
leaving their elected positions 
to take on jobs inside county 
government, city government, 
township government.”

Speaking 
to 
his 
current 

campaign for the seat, Smith 
said he intends to use his 
position as commissioner to 
make county resources more 
accessible to residents and fight 
economic inequality. He cited 
his previous efforts in region-
wide coordination of services 
and 
shaping 
the 
Regional 

Transit 
Authority 
ballot 

proposal.

homophobia,” Schlissel said. “I 
think that faculty have a big role 
to play in helping our students.”

Schlissel 
also 
noted 
that 

throughout 
his 
interactions 

with various groups on campus 
about the incident, students have 
expressed disappointment that 
many professors did not bring up 
the incidents in their classrooms 
to discuss.

“It was on the forefront of the 

minds of a lot of our students, 
almost in a way that distracted 
from learning,” Schlissel said.

In the discussion that ensued, 

Schlissel and many committee 

members 
talked 
about 

increasing faculty interaction 
with the Center for Research on 
Learning and Teaching, a center 
dedicated to improving teaching 
responses to events that impact 
campus climate, by having the 
center facilitate trainings on 
having 
difficult 
discussions 

in classrooms and phasing in 
training for faculty new to 
campus.

SACUA 
member 
Robert 

Ortega, a professor of mechanical 
engineering 
and 
naval 

architecture and engineering, 
suggested extensive resources 
should be made available to 
faculty.

“I think some of the students 

have difficulty with the kind 

of language to engage in these 
conversations; some don’t even 
have the words,” Ortega said. 
“Our approach really has been 
one of humility and that is, even 
the instructors don’t have the 
answers — we certainly can aim 
the discussion, but it has to be 
done with great care.”

Though 
Schlissel 

acknowledged 
that 
making 

the use of CRLT resources 
mandatory for faculty members 
might 
receive 
an 
adverse 

response, he said he hoped 
faculty would want to use 
resources the community had 
deemed important.

“Mandatory 
scares 
people, 

but 
if 
it’s 
something 
that 

really touches our values as 

a community, I don’t think 
mandatory should be threatening 
... but something that we as a 
community agree is important 
enough 
to 
make 
mandatory 

ourselves,” Schlissel said.

In response to the concerns of 

member of SACUA regarding the 
DEI plan, Schlissel stressed that 
a quota system is not part of the 
University’s strategies.

“There is no quota system,” 

Schlissel said. “There are no 
quantitative targets as part of 
the plan.”

Specific racial quotas 
are 

illegal 
in 
college 
admission 

policies, after the Supreme Court 
ruled setting aside specific seats 
for minorities went too far in 
diversifying schools in 1978. The 

Supreme Court has since upheld 
a Michigan proposal banning 
race-based affirmative action of 
any kind in 2014.

The University stopped using 

affirmative action in 2006, when 
voters approved the statewide 
ban, 
and 
Black 
enrollment 

slipped from around 10 percent 
at the time to under 5 percent 
today.

In 
addition 
to 
discussing 

the posters and the DEI plan, 
Schlissel and members of the 
committee 
also 
discussed 

improvements in financial aid, 
an issue heavily emphasized in 
the upcoming University Board 
of Regents’ elections, especially 
as tuition prices continue to 
increase each year.

“We’ve increased our shared 

investment and financial aid 
has gone up over 10 percent 
per year,” Schlissel said. “The 
quality and the depth and the 
size of our pool is fantastic. What 
we really have to do is work hard 
on socioeconomic diversity and 
all the other points of diversity.”

Ortega 
echoed 
Schlissel’s 

remarks and stressed outreach 
as a crucial factor in changing 
the way financial aid is allocated.

“When we talk about the 

Michigan difference, that’s part 
of the difference,” Ortega said. 
“The other one is what they get 
while they’re here as part of the 
difference and what happens 
after.”

students, faculty and alumni 
were in attendance.

Wallace, who grew up in East 

English Village on Detroit’s 
east side, said in an interview 
after the event that he believed 
O’Cleireacain 
painted 
lower-

income 
citizens 
of 
Detroit 

as 
projects 
for 
research, 

something he found particularly 
demoralizing as a resident.

“I found that referring to 

Detroit as a laboratory for public 
policy experiments (was) very 
offensive because you’re dealing 
with people’s real lives,” Wallace 
said. “I am very fortunate to 
come out of my neighborhood 
and go to one of the best schools 
in the world, but I had a lot of 
opportunities that some people 
don’t have and to refer to 
their lives and their futures as 
experiments … is a very slippery 
slope. It causes you to view 
the city and the people in it as 
something less than human.”

When asked about Wallace’s 

question 
after 
the 
lecture, 

O’Cleireacain 
declined 
to 

comment.

O’Cleireacain devoted most of 

the lecture to the city of Detroit’s 
financial strategy. Detroit filed 
for Chapter 9 bankruptcy in July 
2013, making Detroit the largest 
municipality to file for said 
chapter of bankruptcy in U.S. 
history, slashing approximately 

$18 billion in debt. In October 
2014, 
Detroit 
Mayor 
Mike 

Duggan confirmed New Yorker 
O’Cleireacain as the deputy 
mayor 
for 
economic 
policy, 

planning and strategy.

At the lecture, O’Cleireacain 

assured audience members that 
Detroit’s economic operations 
will not be returning to the state 
of the city was in before the 
bankruptcy.

“There are strict recording, 

budgeting 
and 
oversight 

standards 
that 
have 
been 

written both into state law and 
into the bankruptcies … that 
are governing Detroit’s fiscal 
reality and behavior for the 
next 40 years and very strictly 
until 2024,” she said. “Virtually 
nothing 
about 
Detroit’s 

financing and budgeting will be 
the same as before and, folks, 
that’s a really good outcome.”

Along with these guidelines, 

O’Cleireacain discussed what 
Detroit 
offers 
to 
University 

students. Describing the city 
as a “hollowed field,” she said 

students at the University will 
have the chance to implement 
new public policy technology 
in 
a 
city 
without 
common 

infrastructural systems, such as 
a stable school system.

“LED street lighting, mobile 

health units, smartphone-based 
on-street parking meters, and 
Internet bus arrival times have 
been implemented in the last 
two years and that’s just the tip 
of the iceberg,” O’Cleireacain 
said.

During the Q and A, Wallace 

said the litany of infrastructural 
reforms O’Cleireacain listed in 
her speech are not reflected in 
his experiences in Detroit.

“My street had one light 

on it,” Wallace said. “There’s 
abandoned 
buildings 

everywhere, there’s tall grass 
everywhere. Streets are filled 
with 
litter. 
This 
cleanup 

isn’t happening … You don’t 
see the improvement in the 
neighborhoods and with the 
people.”

 O’Cleireacain emphasized 

that economic recovery will not 
occur without the inclusion of all 
Detroit citizens in the process.

“While 
Downtown 
and 

Midtown are well on their way 
to recovery, the recovery has to 
include the Detroiters who live 
in neighborhoods largely left 
untouched by Downtown and 
Midtown,” O’Cleireacain said.

Wallace was approached by 

several students and faculty 
members 
after 
the 
event, 

thanking him for his question 
and comments and asking to 
speak with him in the future 
about public policy projects 
in Detroit. Among those who 
sought out Wallace was Tom 
Ivacko, 
administrator 
and 

program director of CLOSUP, 
who said he believed some of 
O’Cleireacain’s 
remarks 
may 

have 
been 
misinterpreted. 

However, he said Wallace was 
correct 
in 
questioning 
how 

policies impact people.

“(In regard to her public 

policy laboratory comment), I 
interpreted Dr. O’Cleireacain’s 
statement in light of the famous 
phrase 
by 
Louis 
Brandeis: 

The states are ‘laboratories of 

democracy,’ ” Ivacko said. “It’s 
easy to think about policies on a 
theoretical level but they impact 
people’s lives directly and so 
there’s numerous roles for the 
University to be engaged at the 
policy level in neighborhoods 
dealing with people and dealing 
with 
organizations. 
Being 

engaged is the key.”

and brought people together.”

Victor said once she realized 

she was passionate about in 
political 
activism 
and 
the 

diversity and welfare of Detroit, 
she decided to open a bakery 
in 1997 in the Cass Corridor of 
Detroit, using a lot of the same 
equipment from Wildflour after 
they decided to shut down.

“It was a cool handoff,” she 

said. “We even use some of their 
recipes, like their date bars. So 
in some ways my roots are from 
Ann Arbor.”

Noting 
a 
relatively 
new 

bakehouse her company owns 
downtown, Victor said Avalon 
has increased their production 
over the last few years, enabling 
them to be able to open up shop 
so close to campus.

“So we decided to just go for 

it,” Victor said. “There’s always 
been a demand for our product 
in Ann Arbor. Space became 
available 
— 
that’s 
a 
great 

location.”

Helping to make the Ann 

Arbor space a reality is Chef 

Maggie Long, who founded 
the Jolly Pumpkin’s Detroit 
location and will make their 
menu. Victor noted in particular 
that Long works closely with 
local farmers, which she said 
is in line with Avalon’s social 
mission of using locally grown 
products.

“She’s an amazing chef and 

has a wonderful relationship 

with local farmers,” Victor said.

In addition to the breakfast, 

lunch and dinner menus, the cafe 
will sell coffee, baked goods and 
all of Avalon’s breads. Almost 
everything, except some baked 
goods, will be shipped directly 
from the Detroit warehouse. 
Additionally, will sell a full line 

of sweets and dessert goods — 
such as the vegan blueberry 
muffin, scones, brioche, granola 
bars and breakfast sandwiches.

The cafe will also serve beer 

and wine, including some from 
Jolly Pumpkin on Main Street.

Victor said the cafe will have 

an easy and simple breakfast 
menu during the weekdays, but 
a more extensive brunch menu 
on the weekends.

“Our cafe will be featuring 

more meals, some highlighting 
our 
breads 
and 
others 

highlighting the ingredients we 
will be using from local farms 
and other vendors,” Victor said. 
“The cafe will be what I call 
an 
ingredient-driven 
menu, 

so it’s going to be driven by 
what’s seasonal, local, fresh and 
delicious.”

Given this new location is the 

first outside of Detroit, Victor 
said it will be a learning process 
for the bakery, relying mostly on 
customer feedback.

“I think how we’ve always 

evolved as a company is in 
response to our customers,” 
Victor said. “That’s what we’ll 
be doing in Ann Arbor as well.”

“We even use 
some of their 
recipes, like 

their date bars.”

spark discussion of the greater 
political discourse, particularly 
amid the upcoming presidential 
election.

“I feel that liberals have 

failed standing for liberal ideas,” 
Carlos said. “They have failed to 
be as critical of communities of 
faith that have attached to them 
communities like ISIS or people 
that are radicalized — who have 
ideas — that are not compatible 
with liberal values.”

A student who wished to 

remain anonymous said he called 
the police upon seeing the man 
for the second time since Sunday 
night.

“He was walking past the Math 

building through the Diag,” the 
student said. “He was walking 
with the flag … There’s a problem 
with, I think, in particular, the 
fake firearm, because that’s not 
legal.”

Police came to the scene, spoke 

to Carlos and patted him down. 
Carlos said police asked him to 
leave both Sunday and Monday 
night.

“Apparently 
this 
guy 

is 
just 
against 
how 
liberal 

media portrays such an open 
environment 
and 
something 

about how they neglect the more 
oppressive culture of Muslims,” 
Carlos said.

DPSS 
spokeswoman 
Diane 

Brown told The Michigan Daily 
Monday night that the man is not 
committing 
any 
determinable 

crime due to his right to free 
speech.

Following his encounter with 

the police, which he filmed on his 
iPhone, Carlos spoke to a number 
of students gathered around him 
to explain his ideology. Among 
the students was one military-
affiliated male who felt especially 
offended and a female student 
who said she didn’t know how she 
felt about it.

LSA senior Nicole Khamis, 

who witnessed the event, said as 
a Palestinian she felt offended by 
the man’s actions, adding that it 
perpetuated a dominant rhetoric 
around Islam being violent.

“He’s perpetrating this by, first 

off, he’s dressing up as Muslim 
or somebody who believes in 
Islam, continuing furthering that 
stereotype that Islam is a violent 
religion,” Khamis said. “When if 
you look at ISIS and you look at 
the text they use, it’s very specific 
and 
it’s 
cherry-picking 
and 

anybody who’s actually Muslim 
and believes in the Quran you can 
see that they disagree vehemently 
with ISIS and their use and 
contextualization of this.”

Carlos said he found much of 

what students told the Daily in 
response to the Sunday incident 
untrue, though he did not mention 
any specific claims. Students 
said they felt offended by Carlos’ 
actions.

“I want to get rid of political 

correctness that keeps us afraid 
of having a real honest debate 
about this, and that’s why I did 
this,” Carlos said. “I knew that it 
would be offensive and I guess I 
feel that there’s costs and benefits. 
The cost being that it is offensive, 
but the benefit is that we get 
attention, we get a conversation 
going here about what’s going on.”

He added that he expected a 

backlash from students; however, 
he said he doesn’t oppose that 
if the people are doing it in 
opposition to radical Islam.

“I’m not here to make people 

mad,” Carlos said. “I want to have 
a clear critique of ideas, and I want 
there to be space in our public 
discourse for that critique of all 
systems of belief … I’m not saying 
that what I’m doing is ‘working’ — 
it doesn’t have to ‘work.’ ”

displays as well.”

In addition to local efforts, 

Clinton’s 
campaign 
has 

nationally been working to 
appeal to the youth vote in 
addition to encouraging people 
to participate on Election Day. 
Clinton’s 
daughter, 
Chelsea 

Clinton, hosted a conference 
call 
with 
students 
around 

the 
country 
in 
September 

reminding 
them 
of 
the 

importance 
of 
millennial 

participation in the election.

Young people historically 

have low voter turnouts and the 
current millennial generation 
is no exception. While there 
has been a gradual increase 

over the years, the numbers of 
young voters still remains low. 
Less than 20 percent of people 
under 30 voted in the 2014 
midterm elections — the lowest 

youth turnout rate in recorded 
federal election history.

During the primaries, Sen. 

Bernie Sanders’ (I–Vt.) support 
from college students helped 
him up-set Clinton and win the 
state of Michigan. Following 

Sanders’s 
strong 
presence 

on the University’s campus, 
he returned to campaign for 
Clinton for the general election 
in attempt to persuade college 
students to vote for Clinton.

Despite students’ support of 

Sanders in the primary, LSA 
junior Jay Dutcher, campus 
outreach chair of Students 
for Hillary at the University, 
said he believes Clinton is the 
best candidate not just for the 
nation, but also for college 
students.

“Hillary 
believes 
in 
the 

American Dream and believes 
that America is already great 
and believes in the future 
for kids our age and human 
rights,” Dutcher said. “She 
thinks all kids should have 
equal opportunity with their 
education and future.”

opposing Smith, said Smith’s 
conduct had been disingenuous, 
though he noted his opponent 
was likely to win.

“He 
had 
the 
luxury 
of 

turning his back on the people 
he’s supposed to represent for 
a couple months, forcing the 
rest of the board to appoint an 
interim successor, knowing that 
he’ll get re-elected in November 
because 
of 
straight-ticket 

voting,” Hayner said.

In 
an 
interview, 
Eyer 

was hesitant to discuss her 
opponent’s conduct, focusing on 
her platform to improve access 
to public services and combat 
inequality in the county.

“I can’t pretend what was 

in Conan’s head,” Eyer said. 

“I don’t know at what point 
he made decisions or what the 
timeline was. I feel like it’s not 
my place to second-guess those 
decisions. I will say the net 
result was a confusing situation 
for everybody involved but I can 
only focus on my campaign and 
what my standards and conduct 
will be.”

She 
acknowledged 
the 

difficulty write-in candidates 
face in being elected due to 
greater 
straight-ticket 
voting 

in presidential election years. 
However, 
she 
emphasized 

that she is running a “robust 
campaign,” and has raised $1,500 
for her campaign as of Oct. 24, 
according 
to 
state 
financial 

disclosure forms.

Ann 
Arbor 
resident 
Judy 

Foy, who said she has largely 
agreed with Smith’s agenda as 
commissioner, noted that his 

handling of the OCED issue 
disappointed 
her. 
Foy 
also 

expressed disappointment about 
a lack of awareness on the issue.

“I understand even when you 

have great intentions but are 
still not aware how the process 
should move, you can lose a great 
deal of credibility,” Foy said. “It’s 
kind of sad how many people 
don’t know about this situation, 
he’ll just be the name on the 
ballot.”

Vivienne Armentrout — a 

local blogger and former county 
commissioner 
who 
defeated 

Smith in the 2002 Democratic 
primary — declined to discuss 
whether she believed Smith’s 
behavior 
has 
been 
ethical. 

However, 
she 
was 
more 

optimistic that Smith’s write-in 
opponents could win, saying she 
planned to write in Eyer on the 
ballot.

e: 
*Reading 
off 
a 

30-page script in high-
pitched, infantilizing 

voice even though I’m only one 
year older than you*

“Hey everyone, welcome to 

Relationship 
Remix! 

I’m your Sexperteam 
facilitator, Clarissa!”

*10 
minutes 
and 

one obviously forced 
and uncomfortable ice 
breaker later*

“OK! 
Now 
let’s 

talk about our values 
and how we act in 
accordance with those 
values. Can anyone 
give me an example?”

Student 1: “Well I 

value timeliness, so I 
make sure I’m on time to stuff.”

Student 2: “And I value family, 

so I make sure to call my family 
once a week.”

Me: 
“Wow, 
great! 
Thanks 

so much for sharing, everyone! 
Has anyone ever not acted in 
accordance with their values? 
What about when drugs or alcohol 
are involved?”

And so on.
As you might’ve guessed, I 

was a facilitator for Relationship 
Remix. This year, though, I 
quit. When I started facilitating 
Remix three years ago I thought 
I’d be having really honest and 
exciting 
conversations 
about 

sexual health with incoming 
freshpeople. Instead, I ended up 
babying 18 and 19 year olds — I’m 
only 21 — forcing them to chat 
with me, another facilitator and 
40 others about their “values” 
and “choices” for 90 minutes.

The goal of Remix is sexual 

health education and sexual 
violence prevention, which I 
agree with a bajillion percent. 
What I disagree with is the 
way Remix is framed. Remix 
simplifies sexual and romantic 
relationships 
to 
be 
about 

identifying 
your 
values 
and 

acting 
in 
accordance 
with 

those values. It individualizes 
the sexual roles we’ve been 
socialized into and it takes the 
sexuality out of sex.

Remix is an hour-and-a-half 

program, and during the entire 
first hour you don’t talk about sex. 
There’s one part where you think 
about 
potential 
relationships 

(both romantic and not) and 
consider these potential-people-

you-might-be-in-a-relationship-
with’s traits. You then place these 
traits in their respective boxes: 
necessary, bonus, deal breaker, 
OK. The goal of this I think is 
twofold: for the activity to be 

applicable to people 
who don’t experience 
sexual or romantic 
attraction, 
and 
to 

make people who are 
uncomfortable talking 
explicitly about sex feel 
more comfortable.

Realizing that people 

come 
from 
different 

places 
and 
different 

levels of comfort is 
totally legitimate and 
necessary for this kind 
of work, but the extent 

to which Remix doesn’t talk about 
sex during a workshop about sex is 
weird. While many people may feel 
awkward talking about sex or may 
not want to talk about sex at all, a lot 
of people really do want to talk about 
sex and the workshop is literally here 
so we can talk about sex.

Given the current state of 

both sex-negative culture and 
the policies governing sex ed in 
K-12 schools, a lot of people have 
never been given space to talk 
openly about sex. Many students 
are disappointed by Remix when 
they realize the extent of the sex 
discussion is learning the 879 
steps to putting a condom on a 
wooden penis and how to use 
a dental dam (a what?). People 
have questions about sex. People 
want to learn about sex. Let’s 
encourage this conversation; let’s 
give people information. Let’s 
talk about pleasure and orgasms 
rather than timeliness.

The sex part of Remix has 

approximately 
three 
parts: 

talking about consent, a condom 
demonstration and a monologue 
about 
sexual 
violence. 
A 

conversation about consent is 
needed, given the dismal amount 
of sexual violence in the world 
and on college campuses, but we 
do ourselves a disservice when 
we frame consent as merely 
saying and receiving a “yes” or 
“no.” The consent conversation 
that happens in Remix discusses 
interpersonal 
coercion 
and 

manipulation — both of which are 
necessary to acknowledge — but 
what this conversation neglects 
is our social existence during sex.

Simply saying “yes” or “no” to 

sex can only be the qualification 
for consensual sex within a 
hyper-individualist context; it 
does nothing to acknowledge 
the sexual roles we often find 
ourselves trapped within during 
sexual 
experiences. 
Lots 
of 

people say yes to sex even when 
they don’t mean it, even when 
there’s no obvious interpersonal 
coercion or manipulation, and 
even when there are no alcohol 
or other drugs involved. This 
reality is something we have to 
acknowledge and think critically 
about if we want to eliminate it.

The way Remix tries to 

acknowledge this saying-yes-to-
sex-even-when-you-don’t-mean-
it issue is through a role-playing 
exercise. The facilitators tell the 
participants to role play with the 
person sitting next to them and 
give them a couple situations to 
act out. I’ll give you two:

Situation 1: “Someone you 

want to hook up with asks you 
to go up to their room. Practice 
having this conversation.”

Person 1: “Do you want to go 

hook up in my room?”

Person 2: “Sure, let’s go.”
Situation 2: “Someone you don’t 

want to hook up with asks you 
to go up to their room. Practice 
having this conversation.”

Person 1: “Do you want to go 

hook up in my room?”

Person 2: “No.”
No, 
the 
participants 
I’ve 

constructed 
for 
my 
example 

aren’t particularly enthusiastic 
or engaged, but I think this is the 
reality for a lot of participants in 
Remix. I remember when I was a 
participant these were my answers 
to the “role play” scenarios.

These role play “experiences” 

fail for a number of reasons, the 
first of which is they’re painfully 
fake, and the second of which 
deals with the dynamic in the 
room. Remix workshops are 
made up of dorm halls and Remix 
takes place in the fall. What this 
means is that for Remix, people 
are in rooms of 40 strangers with 
whom they’re asked to pretend 
to have conversations about 
hooking up.

Opinion
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com
4 — Tuesday, November 1, 2016

Ilitch stands out for voting 

against tuition increases six times 
during her past eight years as 
regent. She has called both on 
the state of Michigan to increase 
education funding and for the 
creation of a campus commission 
to explore alternative sources of 
revenue for the University aside 
from state funding. Her extensive 
background in business also adds 
important fiscal experience to the 
board. She wants to “get a lid on 
tuition” as the best way to address 
issues of campus diversity.

In addition to her passionate 

advocacy 
for 
an 
affordable 

college education, Ilitch has 
worked throughout her career 
to address critical social issues 
that affect students on campus. 
She has been on the Board 
of Directors of the NAACP’s 
Detroit Branch and serves as 
an advisory board member for 
the American Civil Liberties 
Union. As a regent, she has 
been an advocate for increasing 
awareness about campus sexual 
assault 
and 
was 
supportive 

of 
University 
initiatives 

strengthening the University’s 
sexual misconduct policy. This is 
especially important in context 
of the Department of Education’s 
Office of Civil Rights 2014 
investigation into the University 
violating Title IX. Furthermore, 
she has expressed an interest 
in 
growing 
regent-student 

contact, which is critical for 
regents 
to 
make 
informed 

decisions about what is best for 
the University community.

Many of the benefits of having 

Ilitch remain on the Board 
of Regents are echoed in the 
career history and past policy 
initiatives 
of 
co-incumbent, 

Laurence Deitch.

Deitch is currently the longest-

serving regent, and though we 
understand why there may be 
the assumption that he is out of 
touch with student life — as he 
has now served longer than many 
students have been alive — we 
believe he remains aware of the 
campus environment and issues 
that are important for students. 
Like Ilitch, Deitch has students’ 
financial 
interests 
in 
mind, 

having focused on increasing 
financial aid for students and 

looking for alternative funding 
options for the University. During 
his tenure, tuition increases of 
3.9 percent for in-state students 
and 4.4 percent for out-of-
state students were matched 
with a 10.8-percent increase 
in 
undergraduate 
financial 

aid, in part because of Deitch’s 
advocacy. Even though increases 
in financial aid do not completely 
counteract 
tuition 
increases, 

Deitch has continuously searched 
for alternative solutions, such as 
boosting summer- and spring-
term enrollment, to keep tuition 
as low as possible. Because of his 
past efforts, we have faith that 
he will continue work like this in 
the future.

In addition to being financially 

minded, 
Deitch 
prioritizes 

social issues on campus. A self-
claimed advocate for students’ 
right to free speech, Deitch has 
also consistently advocated for 
diversity within the University, 
first through his co-leadership 
of the 1993 effort to add sexual 
orientation to the University’s anti-
discrimination policy, and most 
recently through his support for 
the Diversity, Equity & Inclusion 
Strategic Plan, with reference to 
the postings of fliers targeting 
minority students on campus as 
evidence for the need to call the 
campus together.

Ilitch and Deitch face eight 

challengers this year. The two 
Republican 
challengers, 
Ron 

Weiser and Carl Meyers, might 
have been the only viable other 
options among the eight because 
of 
their 
finance-mindedness 

and their emphasis on increased 
interaction 
between 
regents 

and students. However, both 
candidates’ stances on improving 
the campus climate for students 
with 
marginalized 
identities 

— critical for a member of the 
governing board for the University 
— leave something to be desired.

Weiser, a generous donor 

to the University, has run on a 
platform of lowering tuition, 
increasing 
transparency 
of 

the Board of Regents, creating 
regent office hours and investing 
more in the Dearborn and Flint 
campuses. He has also voiced 
support for the creation of a 
student regent position and was 

critical of President Schlissel’s 
recent pay raise. While these 
efforts are commendable, past 
comments and parts of his 
platform are causes for concern. 
In 2012, Weiser faced criticism 
for 
using 
racist 
stereotypes 

degrading Detroit voters, which 
reflects negatively on his ability 
to represent the student body. In 
addition, he says in his platform 
he wants to run the University 
“like a business,” which reflects 
a mentality that contradicts the 
role of the University as a public 
educational institution.

Meyers 
has 
also 
focused 

his 
platform 
on 
exercising 

fiscal discipline, transparency 
and student involvement, as 
well as advocating increasing 
accessibility for students of all 
socioeconomic 
backgrounds 

— all of which are admirable 
efforts. In his platform, Meyers 
even 
promises 
to 
propose 

freezing 
tuition 
for 
in-state 

students and seeks to limit 
enrollment of out-of-state and 
international students. While 
increasing accessibility to higher 
education for Michigan residents 
of low socioeconomic status is 
vitally important, much of the 
rhetoric in Meyers’ platform 
is exclusionary to out-of-state 
and 
international 
students 

whose tuition and pursuits at 
the University play a crucial 
role in keeping the University 
financially afloat.

With 
both 
finance 
and 

community in mind, the Daily’s 
Editorial 
Board 
confidently 

endorses 
incumbent 
Regents 

Denise 
Ilitch 
and 
Laurence 

Deitch for re-election to the 
University of Michigan Board 
of Regents. Both candidates 
are aware of University and 
student needs, and have fought 
for affordability while regularly 
showing an active involvement 
in social issues pertinent to 
creating an inclusive campus 
climate. 
Their 
Republican 

challengers 
are 
formidable, 

but neither Weiser nor Meyers 
accurately represent the values 
present on our campus. Ilitch 
and Deitch should be re-elected 
to continue their dedication to 
the University as regents for the 
next eight years.

I

f you have been watching the 
news, scrolling through your 
Twitter feed, sifting through 

your 
Facebook 

timeline or simply 
not living under a 
rock over the past 
few weeks, you know 
that 
Republican 

presidential nominee 
Donald Trump has 
dug himself an even 
deeper 
hole 
this 

election, and I’m not 
sure he’ll be able to 
climb out.

The leaked video of Trump 

degrading women a few weeks 
back proved the sexist nature of the 
Republican nominee and created 
a vacuum of anti-Trump rhetoric 
from both sides of the political 
spectrum. In fact, GOP members 
began to denounce Donald Trump 
as the face of the party in this 
election, scorning the nominee’s 
very unpresidential actions. To 
that, all I can say to Republicans 
who backed Trump in the first 
place is: Are you really surprised?

This 
election 
has 
seen 

Donald Trump insult numerous 
demographics numerous times. 
The leaked video was tangible and 
vivid evidence of an already sound 
fact: Donald Trump is a sexist. 
Yet, even with this disgusting 
video circulating on the internet 
and being talked about on every 
news media outlet, the question of 
Democratic presidential nominee 
Hillary Clinton’s email controversy 
still is being talked about as an 
equivalent offense to Trump’s 
actions. The danger in this is 
that one concerns the faults of a 
politician, and the other concerns 
the faults of a human being.

As many of us know, this has 

been 
a 
media-driven, 
policy-

lacking election. Events in the 
candidates’ pasts have been talked 
about in debates more than pivotal 
policy issues. It has become an 
entertaining 
and 
provocative 

election, 
but 
for 
the 
wrong 

reasons. It’s true: The past actions 
of presidential nominees do hold 
a great amount of relevance when 

voters go to the polls 
in November. We are 
voting for the leader of 
our country, the face 
of our country and the 
person who is going to 
change our country. A 
nominee’s past speaks 
to their character: What 
they have done speaks 
to what they will do, so 
it’s rational and right to 
give sure weight to the 

past of both Donald Trump and 
Hillary Clinton.

However, 
the 
histories 
of 

Clinton and Trump have become 
too relevant in the way we are 
discussing 
them. 
They 
have 

become points of entertaining 
news cycles and political debate. 
The U.S. public is caught up in 
the intriguing “he said, she said” 
stories, weighing these tabloid-
worthy, scandal-clad events on par 
with proposed policy. Both sides of 
the political spectrum scrutinize 
the opposing candidate’s past — 
a back-and-forth that has been 
going on for the past two months. 
Regardless, we cannot weigh the 
past of Hillary Clinton against that 
of Donald Trump, especially now 
with the Access Hollywood video 
as the icing on the cake of Donald 
Trump’s failed crusade to winning 
the presidency.

Every 
politician 
makes 

mistakes. If you look back through 
history, no president has gotten 
through 
his 
term 
perfectly 

unscathed. However, these same 
presidents have owned up to their 
mistakes, to their political faults 
and to their missteps in judgment. 
They have done the right thing 
by admitting they did the wrong 
thing. Hillary Clinton’s political 
past is tainted with both scandal 
and mistakes. This is true, but that 
doesn’t mean she is somehow even 
with Donald Trump, an argument 
we seem to be making by applying 

“choosing the lesser of two evils” 
to this election. Talk from the 
Conservative right uses Clinton’s 
political mistakes to lessen the 
damage of Trump’s recent and 
past human failings.

The email controversy still 

being talked about now, while a 
mistake on Clinton’s part, does 
not match the degree of Trump’s 
long and historic slew of insults 
and disregard for human beings. 
Trump’s grotesque and sexist 
remarks are ones that target 
human 
beings 
and 
human 

rights. A woman’s right to be 
respected by the men in her life, 
and the men in the world, is a 
human right — a right Trump so 
blatantly ignored. Any woman 
— of any party, race, religion, 
background, level of education — 
has been insulted by that video.

The clear difference between 

the two is the fact that only one 
has taken true responsibility for 
her mistakes while the other has 
defensively protested them, even 
in the face of clear evidence. In 
fact, last week, Donald Trump 
threatened to sue all women who 
have accused him of sexual assault.

This defensive act and pure 

disregard for what his own words 
truly meant is the difference 
between the human being Donald 
Trump is and the human being 
Hillary Clinton is. Clinton has 
admitted to the mistakes of her 
past. She hasn’t gone on the 
defensive and argued that the 
media, the Liberals and the world 
are against her. No, she has taken 
responsibility for her wrongdoings, 
admitting to her own flaws.

Hillary Clinton and Donald 

Trump are two flawed candidates, 
possibly 
the 
most 
flawed 

candidates a U.S. election has seen, 
but measuring their flaws against 
each other isn’t fair. Those political 
mistakes of Clinton are no match 
for the human faults of Trump.

Ilitch, Deitch for Regents

N

ext week, the residents of the state of Michigan, including any 
student registered to vote in the state, will be voting on two 
open positions on the University of Michigan Board of Regents. 

According to Michigan’s State Constitution, the Board of Regents 
maintains a “general supervision” of the University and directs the funds 
and expenditures for each year. For their focus on an increasingly inclusive 
campus climate and on sensible finances for the University, which we 
believe best exemplifies the responsibility the Constitution requires of 
regents, we endorse the two incumbents, Denise Ilitch (D–Bingham 
Farms) and Laurence Deitch (D–Bloomfield Hills) for the two positions on 
the University’s Board of Regents up for election on Nov. 8.

WARNER BROS.

Maybe you could conjure up some more Tim Burton movies.

’Tis the season of Halloween, 

and besides putting on a pair 
of mouse ears or paraphernalia 
associated with Ken Bone, Hal-
loween is also the time of year 
that horror movies make their 
grand reappearance on network 
television.

Although the majority of these 

movies are available year-round, 
there’s always something spe-
cial about the tradition of Hal-
loween horror flicks. Perhaps 
it’s the ambiance of the season 
that causes our brains to crave 
the jump-scare; maybe it’s the 
gloomy weather that confines 
our entertainment to indoor 
activities. Although both of these 
options are cause enough to jus-
tify kicking back for a horror 
flick with some pals, neither one 
accomplishes more than scratch-
ing the surface of why we prefer 
Halloween with a side of horror.

In preparation for October 

31st, Freeform and Syfy provided 
viewers with channel lineups of 
popular horror movie flicks under 
the brands “13 Nights of Hallow-
een” and “31 Days of Halloween,” 
respectively. Where Freeform 
(traditionally ABC Family’s “13 
Days of Halloween”) tends to err 
on the side of the family-friendly 
scares, Syfy’s rendition of the Hal-
loween marathon series played 
fan favorites like “The Conjur-
ing” and network originals such 
as “The Night Before Halloween.”

However, devoted fans of ABC 

Family’s original lineup were 
disappointed to learn that many 
of Tim Burton’s films would be 
left out of the lineup this year, 
along with the “Halloweentown” 
series, which only aired on the 
graveyard shift for those of us still 
awake and craving that essential 
piece of our childhoods.

While the films in the Free-

from lineup are not necessarily 
scarier than a film like “Hocus 
Pocus,” we seem to miss them 
the most out of the set this year. 
In fact, one could say Freeform’s 
decision not to include the Burton 
movies as a crime against Hal-
loween itself, with the creepy and 
terrifying nature of the flicks as 
the perfect ambiance for a Hal-
loween marathon.

Even for networks that don’t 

typically run a Halloween pro-
gram like Syfy and Freeform, the 
creepy vibe was in the air. While 
FOX aired their rendition of the 
1975 fan favorite “Rocky Hor-
ror Picture Show,” MTV put on a 
Halloween special as promotional 
material for their reimagining of 
the “Scream” franchise. With all 
of these options to choose from, 
the lust for horror was palpable, 
only growing stronger as the 
date itself approached. And while 
those looking for a Halloween 
throwback often find themselves 
on the Freeform end of the spec-
trum, viewers craving spookier 
and generally scarier flicks found 
themselves on channels like Syfy 
and AMC this Halloween.

Yet, for those who fall on the 

scarier side of the spectrum, their 
choices will generally lack that 
“feel good” quality, opting instead 
for edge of the seat suspense and 
scare tactics to freak viewers out. 
This is a common aspect of the 
Burton films, which are in no way 
kid-friendly, despite its achieve-
ment in animation. So, if movies 
such as these cause us to jump in 
our seats and clutch those blan-
kets just a little bit tighter, why 
do we like them, and even prefer 
them to the softcore horror films 
such as “Halloweentown”?

Psychology and evolution has 

taught us that fear is essential 
— lifesaving, even. The sympa-
thetic nervous system initiates 
our “fight or flight” response as 
a result of environmental trig-

gers. Everything from a pop quiz 
to a bear attack induces a fear 
response, which writers and 
directors in the horror genre 
utilize to their advantage in an 
incredibly formulaic production. 
As is often the case in this genre, 
suspenseful music and camera 
angles push our fear response 
closer and closer to the edge. 
This is often utilized through the 
technique of ‘jump scares,’ which 
originated in 1976’s “Carrie” and 
became a building block for the 
horror genre. However, despite 
these fear tactics built to give 
audiences a mini heart attack, 
audiences keep coming back for 
more. But why?

The answer is that there really 

is no concrete reason for why we 
like scary or gory movies. How-
ever, that hasn’t stopped multiple 
theories from emerging either in 
favor or against horror — while 
Aristotle stood by the idea of 
catharsis, film scholar Noël Car-
roll believes horror movies are 
the product of curiosity and fas-
cination, the latter of which is a 
common and agreeable theory.

Take the “Saw” franchise for 

instance, which works up your 
sympathetic nervous system as 
the brutal game of survival plays 
out on your screen. During those 
films your subconscious may be 
playing its own game of surviv-
al, testing your brain in a secret 
“what would I do in this situation” 
and playing it all out, silently, in 
your mind. Only your body regis-
ters these physical changes by the 
hammering of your heart and the 
quickening of your breath while, 
all this time, your brain has been 
learning and absorbing informa-
tion along the way. So, if these 
scarier, jumpscare, movies are 
inducing a sort of learning, take it 
as a free pass to binge all of your 
favorite horror flicks during Hal-
loween season. You might pick up 
a thing or two along the way.

The foundation of horror and the 
tradition of Halloween flicks on TV

TV NOTEBOOK

You know that girl you see 

walking around sometimes? She 
struts like the entire world is her 
red carpet, accessorizing a know-
ing glint in her eye with a smirk. 
You either love her or hate her, 
but no one can deny that she is 
capital-C cool.

Tove Lo’s newest album, Lady 

Wood, is that girl. Through syn-
thetic background rhythms and 
electric vocals, Lady Wood pres-
ents a contradiction. The glossy 
persona that Tove Lo shaped 
through computerized harmo-
nies is repeatedly shattered by 
moments of honesty and Tove 
Lo puts her entire cool girl self 
in her vocals, which adds a extra 

dimension to the very untouch-
able electronic-pop songs. Lady 
Wood builds a story that reveals 
both the perfect and the imper-
fect aspects of Tove Lo, tying it 
all together with a steady base 
and stimulating beat. 

This 
narrative 
commences 

with “Fairy Dust 
 — Chapter I,” 

which indeed sets up the album’s 
stage. Short, devoid of vocals and

ALBUM REVIEW
intensely creepy, this song reveals 
to all that Tove Lo is not messing 
around. Armed with a fluid, shift-
ing cacophony of strange synths 
and beats, ‘Fairy Dust — Chapter 
I” is a primer for the first half of 
the album, creating an passion-
ate and unrestrained base for the 
songs of Lady Wood to layer onto.

Songs 
like 
“Lady 
Wood,” 

“True Disaster” and “Cool Girl” 
are splattered onto the composed 
foundation to add more details 
to the masterpiece 
Tove Lo is con-
structing. 
“Lady 

Wood” is sparking 
with catchy melo-
dies and buzzing 
with deeply primi-
tive 
rhythms, 

while “True Disas-
ter” is more invigorating, with 
pulsing beats that create a driv-
ing undercurrent. “Cool Girl” is 
swirling with cutting vocals and 
sharply shifting tempos. All these 
songs serve to further develop 
the plot that was set up in “Fairy 
Dust—Chapter I.” Ardent and 
demanding, they create an image 
that is ice cold, faultless and 
unblemished; the beginning half 
of this album is untouchable.

However, the cracks in Tove 

Lo’s perfect persona become 
evident in the second half of 
Lady Wood, which is introduced 
through the song “Fire Fade — 
Chapter II.” Much like “Chapter 
I,” “Fire Fade — Chapter II” is 

brief and mysterious, with murky 
rhythms swimming out through 
the gloom. But while “Chap-
ter I” was fervent and dynamic, 
this song is subdued and vul-
nerable; crisp edges are blurred 
while “where are you…? I’m lost” 
echoes over a foggy background. 
“Fire Fade — Chapter II” marks 
a shift: if the first half of Lady 
Wood was Tove Lo building 
impermeable walls up, then the 
second half of Lady Wood is Tove 

Lo breaking those 
walls down.

This 
openness 

appears in songs 
like 
“Imaginary 

Friend,” “Flashes” 
and “WTF Love 
Is.” While these 
songs are still elec-

trifying and showcase Tove Lo’s 
iconic electronic-pop sound, the 
background harmonies are more 
muted, allowing the spotlight 
to focus on Tove Lo’s impact-
ing vocals, rich in sincerity and 
depth. Lines like “reminding me 
that there’s nothing to fear in the 
things I’m afraid of” from “Imag-
inary Friend” or “people come, I 
push them away” from “Flashes” 
allow these songs to be forthcom-
ing in describing secretive fears 
and weaknesses. The second part 
of Lady Wood feels like the hid-
den uncertainties whispered in 
the dead of night, pieces of you 
that are too fragile for the light of 
day to see.

Lady Wood is expertly divided 

into two parts: the first part is 
dedicated to building a seamless 
“cool girl” façade while the sec-
ond part is dedicated to revealing 
the humane cracks and faults in 
what appeared to be so unattain-
able. Tove Lo’s intricate narra-
tion is what makes the album so 
compelling and what saves the 
album from falling into repeti-
tiveness.

While individual songs are an 

elaborate assortment of detailed 
synchronizations and tempos, 
many of them fit a template that 
Tove Lo has perfected: muted 
stanzas building up to explosive 
choruses against a fluid, almost 
psychedelic 
backdrop. 
While 

Tove Lo can fall into a habit of 
overusing this template, what 
stops the overall album from 
straying into monotonous ter-
ritory is the constant narrative 
aspect. 

Tove Lo is a storyteller in Lady 

Wood and the tale she tells is 
personable because of the way it 
divulges previously hidden flaws. 
Its power comes from the idea it 
proposes: inner imperfections 
don’t make you incomplete but 
rather do the opposite. They are 
something of which to be proud. 
Besides, “cool girl” is still a nor-
mal girl, and, as Tove Lo demon-
strates through Lady Wood, one 
that hides that same uncertain-
ties and shortcomings as every-
body else.

All it takes is one photo to 

initiate social change; that and 
years of defiant work to produce 
this 
moment. 
A 

well 
composed 

photo can encap-
sulate the pain and 
struggles of thou-
sands and tell their 
story in one frame. 
Although it seems 
like it, these photos 
aren’t anomalies or 
instances of being 
at the right place 
at the right time. 
On April 19, 1969, 
a photo of several 
black Cornell stu-
dents holding guns and wearing 
bandoleers on the steps of Wil-
lard Straight Hall surfaced the 
cover of Newsweek and other 
publications. The picture marks 
a moment in which persecuted 
black students armed them-
selves and stayed in the hall in 
fear for their lives after a series 
of threatening and damaging 
events that night. Regardless of 
its initial misunderstanding, the 
story behind this picture exposed 
racism in higher education and 
remains a crucial moment in the 
late ’60s civil rights movement.

“Agents of Change” retells 

the events leading up to this pic-
ture at both Cornell University 
and San Francisco State Univer-
sity (SFSU). It includes current 
interviews with the actual pro-
testers ¾ who all appear to look 
far younger than they likely are 
¾ that retell the events how 
they actually happened. Danny 
Glover (“Lethal Weapon”) is the 
only celebrity included, and his 
screen time is balanced with oth-
ers less famous though equally 
regarded in their respective field. 
Each interviewee is poised and 

so proud of their efforts, and it is 
inspiring to see.

The San Francisco State Uni-

versity 
and 
Cornell 
protests 

were among the most potent of 
the civil rights movement of the 

’60s. 
Black 
stu-

dents spoke out 
against 
unequal 

opportunity 
in 

higher 
education 

and 
a 
Eurocen-

tric 
curriculum 

that 
neglected 

minority 
groups. 

Unfortunately, 
equal representa-
tion in many col-
leges, 
including 

The University of 
Michigan, is still a 
critical issue today.

“Agents of Change” informs 

and inspires to replicate such tre-
mendous efforts as those seen at 
SFSU and Cornell. The connec-
tion with these movements and 
those today, however, is unclear. 
It doesn’t ever reference changes 
that could be made today, so it 
is up to the viewer to make this 
connection between the past 
and present. As clear as it is that 
these issues still exist today, some 
viewers might lack the intuition 
to make a connection. It is not 
necessarily a mistake, but not 
bluntly stating a connection to 
today’s social climate prevents 
the documentary from explor-
ing the issues more deeply. The 
goals of “Agents of Change” are 
unclear; is it simply informative, 
or a reminder of what change can 
be done today?

The documentary is extreme-

ly focused to the extent that, 
essentially, all of the content is 
about the SFSU and Cornell pro-
tests during the ’60s. Its narrow 
focus is its best and worst qual-
ity. Viewers will learn a lot about 
these protests while sacrificing 
other knowledge about its vari-

ous contemporary protests. By 
doing so, it tackles almost every 
aspect of the two protests; it is 
impossible to get a more detailed 
summation than what is provid-
ed in “Agents of Change.” Sadly, 
viewers looking for entertain-
ment along with education may 
get a little distracted at times. 
The documentary doesn’t reflect 
the zeitgeist of the late ’60s. Rath-
er, it tells a story of human will 
and the power to create change 
rather than recap the overall 
feeling of the time period. Those 
looking for a more holistic retell-
ing should seek out a less focused 
documentary.

“Agents of Change” is stylis-

tically subtle. It tells its narra-
tive through interviews and not 
flashy graphics or pseudo-artis-
tic montages. Its soundtrack is 
diverse and rich, including tracks 
like Jimi Hendrix’s version of 
“All Along the Watchtower” and 
Michael Jackson’s “They Don’t 
Care About Us.” 

In the early ’70s, efforts to 

increase black student enroll-
ment at the University of Michi-
gan were made in order to reflect 
the population of African Ameri-
cans in the state (10%). Today, 
the University fails to even graze 
such numbers. With only a 4% 
black student population at the 
school, it is far from reflecting 
the 14% population in the state. 
Certainly, the repeal of affirma-
tive action and intransigent poli-
cymakers stand in the way. The 
efforts seen within “Agents of 
Change” should act as a remind-
er that progress is always, not 
only a possibility, but a probabil-
ity when passionate, motivated 
people come together for a move-
ment greater than oneself.

“Agents of Change” is being 

screened by the Department for 
Afroamerican and African Studies 
from 4-6 at Haven Hall on Novem-
ber 3rd.

Fashion designer Iris van Her-

pen is known for pushing the 
envelope. A guest member of the 
Fédération Française de la Cou-
ture, she is notorious for creat-
ing experimental materials and 
seamlessly weaving them into her 
collection, and is even responsible 
for introducing 3D printing to the 
forefront of fashion. This past 
Thursday, viewers had the privi-
lege of hearing the Dutch inno-
vator speak alongside architect 
Philip Beesley and museum cura-
tor Sarah Schleuning as a part of 
the University’s Penny Stamps 
Distinguished 
Speaker 
Series. 

Without further ado, here are my 
favorite van Herpen-approved 
nuggets of wisdom.

Become inspired by other 

fields.

The 
designer 
repeatedly 

declared her affinity for archi-
tectural work, noting that she has 
actually collaborated with Bees-
ley on several of her collections. 
“When I saw [Beesley’s] work, 
I saw the possibility of working 
with an architect. I started see-
ing that architecture can be very 
much related to fashion. It really 
opened me up to seeing material 
differently, to seeing a different 
future for fashion,” van Herpen 
said.

Don’t get caught up in the 

deadlines.

If a woman who works around 

the fashion calendar can do that, 
so can we. She acknowledged 
the industry’s obstacles openly, 
explaining, “On one hand, I am 
working within fashion, so I usu-
ally have three months to com-
plete a collection, which does 
take certain possibilities out. But 
on the other, I try to forget about 
time when I research material and 
structure. I don’t see [research] as 
a part of a collection directly, I see 
it as an ongoing process within my 
work.”

Success requires patience.
All of van Herpen’s collabora-

tions have been remarkably grad-
ual processes.

“In the beginning, the con-

versations are much more about 
getting to know each other,” she 
said. “After so many years, all 
that is known, and it’s possible to 
go deeper and deeper into a con-
versation, into the way we both 
work.”

We are not robots, and that’s 

OK.

In fact, the designer owns her 

human touch. When describ-
ing a particular jacket, she noted 
“There is difference in detail 
— every piece is made by hand. 
They are all a little bit different in 
length, in size, in structure, and 
I think, together with the move-
ment of the body, we can create a 
magical element.”

Although we are all human, 

each of us operates differently.

Some of us are bound to stray 

from the status quo, as van Her-

pen demonstrates beautifully.

“The way I design is not by 

sketching something,” she said. 
“The mannequins in my atelier 
are my sketchbook. I drape the 
material directly onto the man-
nequins, and that’s how the pieces 
develop. That way of designing, 
the draping of the material, has 
become very important in the 
structures we develop now, and I 
really feel it has moved us forward 
a lot.”

Limitations will always exist.
It’s up to us to make the best of 

them. “A lot of the material that I 
create comes slightly also from a 
frustration toward all the materi-
als I cannot work with,” van Her-
pen said. “That inspires me to look 
at an existing material that can be 
worked with in a different way. 
It’s often very much sort of magni-
fying the movement of the body.”

However, 
these 
setbacks 

should not keep us from dream-
ing big.

When asked what material 

she does want to work with but 
cannot, van Herpen responded 
immediately: “Fire is one of them. 
There are so many, basically any-
thing I can’t work with that trig-
gers my mind to think of different 
options and possibilities towards 
the body.”

Van Herpen’s philosophies are 

mindful approaches that can be 
applied to a variety of disciplines, 
and something she hopes is ear-
nest fuel for University students’ 
own creative pursuits.

STYLE COVERAGE

October is the best month of 

the year. That is a fact. Leaves 
change, 
temperatures 
drop 

and things start to get kind of 
spooky. Similarly, Halloween is 
my favorite holiday — it’s better 
than Christmas or Hanukkah, 
even better than Christmak-
kuah (sorry, Seth). In prepara-
tion for the holiest (and most 
haunted) of days, I rewatched 
some of my old holiday favor-
ites. 

I started my binge with “Car-

rie” (the 1976 Sissy Spacek ver-
sion, of course). The film is a 
perfect specimen of absurdity 
— blood-soaked, burn-down-
the-high-school-gym 
absur-

dity.

The miracle of “Carrie,” or 

rather what should have been 
the film’s downfall, is that noth-
ing happens until the very end. 
Really nothing. Carrie flips an 
ashtray and makes some light 
bulbs burst with her mind con-
trol powers. (What are Carrie’s 
actual powers? No one seems to 
know; she’s sort of a malicious 
Matilda.) It’s not until the buck-
et of pigs’ blood come tumbling 
down that shit starts to get real. 
And it gets so real so fast.

It almost feels like “Carrie” 

is going to break free of hor-
ror movies’ rigid rules of sex 

and death. And it does and it 
doesn’t. Because Carrie is both 
the final girl — the token vir-
gin who gets to live to the final 
credits — and the primary “vil-
lain.” She’s the protagonist and 
the source of horror.

That’s not to say she isn’t 

weirdly sexualized. The film 
opens with her in the shower 
(in classic horror movie fash-
ion). The camera pans over her 
body at a length of zoom that 
does not allow her to be any-
thing more than a body. Then, 
she 
starts 
bleeding. 
Carrie 

doesn’t know it, but the source 
of her blood is menstrual. And 
even that is filmed in a sexual 
fashion.

So, the movie gets points 

for showing natural feminine 
body processes, but loses them 
for having to sexualize it. And 
the kids who do die (the not-
so-final girls, if you will) are 
separated from Carrie by their 

sexuality. They give John Tra-
volta (yeah, John Travolta is in 
this) blowjobs in the front seat 
of his car. They die.

There was an attempt at a 

remake in 2013 starring Chloe 
Grace Moretz, who sadly was 
not a very good Carrie. Even 
though she is a really nice per-
son, which I know because 
music writer, Dom Polsinelli 
made me wait in line with him 
for half an hour to meet her 
when she came to Ann Arbor to 
campaign for Hillary. Thanks, 
Dom.

The remake failed not only 

because remakes almost always 
fail, but because it is impossible 
to try to make anyone other 
than Sissy Spacek into Carrie. 
She’s just too perfect. With 
her bug-eyed stare and subtle 
Texas twang, she’s the perfect 
religious-girl-who-loses-it. And 
when she does lose it, she does 
so with one of the best depic-
tions of paralyzing rage I’ve 
ever seen.

So a second — or third or thir-

tieth — time around, “Carrie” 
holds up. It’s an underrated gem 
of my favorite decade of horror. 
It’s absurd enough to not be ter-
rifying and bloody enough to be 
entertaining. Knives fly, gyms 
burn down and Carrie remains 
one of the baddest bitches/
witches/girls who were bullied 
in high school of all time.

FROM THE VAULT

MADELEINE GAUDIN

Daily Arts Writer

After meeting and collabo-

rating during their time at the 
University of Michigan’s School 
of Music, The-
atre and Dance, 
Jack 
Stratton, 

Theo Katzman, 
Woody 
Gross 

and 
Joe 
Dart 

formed 
Vulf-

peck as more or 
less a love letter 
to the funk leg-
ends of western civilization’s 
past. One of the band’s focuses 
has always been ensuring that 
their studio cuts are recorded 
like live tracks, using actual 
instruments when possible and 
avoiding 
recording 
multiple 

takes.

This may seem like semantics, 

but the results of their approach 
are readily audible through 
their discography. Although it is 
a half-step away from this ide-
ology, Vulfpeck’s latest album, 
The Beautiful Game, remains 
true to the band’s original funk 
inspirations while incorporat-
ing a sleeker sound.

Although the album opens 

with the instrumental “Sweet 
Science,” the jubilant “Animal 
Spirits” seems a more suitable 
introduction. The former is a 
slinky, mournful clarinet solo, 
while the latter utilizes piano, a 
synthesizer, and a classic hand-
clap sample, doing more justice 
to the band’s overall sound.

“Animal Spirits” is also one 

of the most lyrically involved 
songs on the album, with vocal-
ist 
Stratton 
predicting 
the 

future relationship of two indi-
viduals who have yet to meet. 
“This is a true love story song 

/ A triumph and a 
glory song / With 
only 
one 
small 

caveat / This one 
hasn’t 
happened 

yet,” Stratton sings. 
“They’ve 
got 
16 

mutual friends.”

Approximately 

half of the album 

is comprised of instrumen-
tal tracks, which can at times 
struggle 
to 
hold 
attention. 

“Dean Town” and “El Chepe” 
are both interesting explora-
tions, but seem out of place. 
They would make more sense in 
the space between songs during 
a live set than on a true album, 
and it’s not difficult to imagine 
them as entirely improvisation-
al pieces.

Not all of the instrumental 

portions of the album fall into 
this same category, however. 
Grounded by a driving bass 
line, the bombastic pairing of 
saxophone and percussion (and 
later, piano) on “Daddy, He Got 
a Tesla” captures attention with 
ease and demonstrates how 
easily Vulfpeck can dominate a 
room, even while instruments 
share the spotlight.

While this is a band that 

rightfully prides themselves on 
their genuine nature, there are 
also moments on The Beautiful 
Game that border on kitschi-

ness. Perhaps it is an intended 
effect, but “1 for 1, DiMaggio” 
feels far too much like a sing-
along from a children’s televi-
sion show. The instrumental 
craftsmanship is undeniable, 
but the lyrical content ranges 
from uncomfortable at best to 
patronizing at worst. Similarly, 
the opening moments of “Con-
scious Club” feel notably con-
trived — partially because they 
are. Both songs utilize scripted 
spoken dialogue, but it is little 
more than a novelty.

While these two tracks seem 

to fall especially flat, the album 
closes out confidently. “Aunt 
Leslie” is the most emotional 
centerpiece of the album, on 
which Stratton and regular 
Vulfpeck guest Antwaun Stan-
ley flex their vocal abilities. 

This is immediately followed 

by the jammy “Cory Wong,” 
which evolves into what sounds 
like a live recording — the crowd 
begins cheering at about the 
two-minute mark and is closed 
out by applause and Stratton 
bidding the audience farewell.

As a funk outfit in the modern 

day, Vulfpeck have a valuable 
addition to their resume with 
The Beautiful Game, but it can 
at times feel haphazardly pieced 
together, with little cohesion 
beyond the wide domain of 
“funk.”

Regardless, Vulfpeck’s tech-

nical capabilities and sheer 
devotion to their craft over-
shadow any awkward moments 
that may result from this lack of 
cohesion.

For Poggi, Maryland game serves as a reunion

While most of the Michigan 

football team will be anticipating 
a 
meeting 
with 
its 
former 

defensive coordinator, redshirt 
junior fullback Henry Poggi 
will be looking forward to the 
Wolverines’ 
matchup 
with 

Maryland on Saturday for a 
much more personal reason.

Poggi attended the Gilman 

School 
in 
Baltimore, 
Md., 

where his father, Biff, was the 
head coach. Both Poggis are 
now in Ann Arbor after Biff 
took a job as the Wolverines’ 
“associate head coach/special 
advisor” this offseason. And 
this weekend, there will be a 
third member of the household 
in 
town, 
though 
he’s 
not 

technically a blood relative.

Melvin Keihn is a redshirt 

sophomore defensive end for the 
Terrapins who left Liberia when 
he was 8. His Maryland bio says 
his hometown is Towson, Md., 
but it does not detail his actual 
living situation there.

“I just call him my little 

brother, because he lives at our 
house,” Poggi said of Keihn. 
“Whenever we get breaks from 
college, he’ll be back there. He’s 
a really good kid.”

Poggi says the arrangement 

stemmed from simple utility. 
Keihn’s father’s job would have 
made it difficult for his son to 
attend Gilman, so he moved in 
with the Poggis. In that time, he 
became like another sibling to 
Henry, who said Keihn “goes on 
all our family vacations.”

In a 2014 profile in The 

Baltimore Sun, Katherine Dunn 
explained 
Keihn’s 
story 
in 

even greater depth. The article 
detailed how, at 8 years old, 
Keihn’s mother put him on a 
plane from Monrovia to “take 
him away from a life of labor on 
the rice farm where they both 
worked amid the threat that he 

could be forced at any time to 
become a child soldier in the 
West African nation emerging 
from a second civil war.”

And he has indeed lived a 

very different life in the United 
States. Keihn originally signed 
to play for Virginia Tech before 
transferring to Maryland and 
sitting out last season. Through 
eight games this year, Keihn has 
yet to start, but has played in 
seven games and recorded two 
tackles for loss.

Speaking to reporters Monday, 

Poggi didn’t go into great depth 
about 
his 
relationship 
with 

Keihn, or what it was like to have 
him living with his family. But 
on a weekend that will also pit 
the fullback against his former 
high school quarterback, Shane 

Cockerille (now a linebacker at 
Maryland), as well as Terrapins 
head coach D.J. Durkin against 
his former defense, it’s one of 
the many reunions fans can 
look forward to 
Saturday.

Durkin 

helped 
turn 

the Wolverines 
into one of the 
nation’s 
top 

defenses 
last 

season, a mantle 
upon 
which 

they have only 
improved under 
new coordinator 
Don Brown. Routinely, players 
and coaches praised Durkin’s 
intensity, and his future as a head 
coach was apparent early on in 

his tenure at Michigan.

That came to fruition early 

last December, when he accepted 
a job to become the head coach 
of the Terrapins, and he has 

made quick work 
of 
justifying 

the hire. After 
finishing 3-9 last 
season, Maryland 
is sitting at 5-3 
this year under 
Durkin, just one 
win away from 
bowl eligibility.

“He’s done a 

fabulous 
job,” 

said 
Michigan 

coach Jim Harbaugh. “Just 
always respected D.J. as a 
tremendous competitor at the 
highest level. Smile thinking 

about 
his 
competitiveness. 

And also always happy for a 
friend’s success. I think he’s 
doing a fabulous job (with) his 
entire staff and team. You can 
see the energy. You can see 
the strength. You can see the 
competitiveness and execution 
on the field, etc. The flip side 
of that is we know that this’ll 
be a big game, this will be a 
championship game. This will 
be a real test for our club.”

But even while the sentiments 

of reunion are in the air, Poggi 
said he has no trouble getting 
psyched up for the game. When 
he sees Cockerille and Keihn on 
the field, he’s excited to do more 
than just say hello.

“It’ll be nice to smack those 

guys,” Poggi said. “For sure.”

After stressful decision, Higdon finds place at Michigan

On Feb. 4, 2015 — National 

Signing Day — Karan Higdon felt 
sick to his stomach.

The 
running 
back 
from 

Sarasota, Fla., wasn’t even sure 
he wanted to go to his signing 
ceremony at Riverview High 
School that day, and he had still 
not made up his mind when he 
sat down at a table with two 
offer letters. One was from 
Iowa, where he had already 
verbally committed the previous 
October, and the other was from 
Michigan, a contender that had 
just offered him the week before.

Neither Higdon nor his family 

knew what would happen when 
he sat down at the table, but he 
said he ultimately went with 
his instincts and chose to sign 
with the Wolverines. And those 
instincts, 
surprisingly, 
had 

nothing to do with football.

“It was really me just looking 

at life after football,” Higdon 
said Monday. “Football is not 
a promising game — you never 
know when your last snap or 
play is gonna be, so you’ve 
gotta think about the things 
that’s gonna build you as a 
person versus building you as a 
football player.”

Because of his lifelong desire 

to help people, Higdon has 
wanted to be in the medical 
field since he was 7. He saw an 
opportunity to get a quality 
medical education at Michigan, 
where he is currently studying 
to become a Certified Registered 
Nurse Anesthetist (CRNA).

On the football side of things, 

though, the three-star recruit 
coming to Ann Arbor surprised 
many 
fans. 
When 
Higdon 

committed, 
the 
Wolverines 

already had three experienced 
backs on the roster and appeared 
to be in the mix for four-star 

Mike Weber, who ultimately 
signed with Ohio State.

Almost two years later, though, 

Higdon has found his place on the 
field as well as in the classroom. 
As a surprise member of a four-
man running back rotation, the 
sophomore has racked up 403 
yards on 53 carries for an eye-
popping 7.6 yards per touch. His 
six rushing touchdowns are the 
most of any running back on the 
roster and more than anyone 
else except the team’s goal-
line specialist, redshirt junior 
fullback Khalid Hill.

Higdon became Michigan’s 

go-to back in the fourth quarter 
of Saturday’s win over Michigan 
State, as the Wolverines tried to 
pick up first downs and run out 

the clock. He came up short on 
his last few attempts — in part 
due to what Higdon deemed 
a questionable spot on third 
down — but the coaching staff’s 
willingness to use him proved 
their trust in him.

“Karan does a good job, 

maybe the best job of hitting the 
hole,” said Michigan coach Jim 
Harbaugh. “He hits it downhill 
very fast. We felt like we needed 
that in that part of the ballgame.”

The 
running-back-by-

committee 
approach 
wasn’t 

necessarily what the Wolverines 
had planned to start the season, 
but the emergence of Higdon 
and freshman Chris Evans has 
almost forced running backs 
coach Tyrone Wheatley’s hand. 

Higdon played sparingly as a true 
freshman, managing just 19 yards 
on 11 carries, but he burst onto the 
scene in fall camp this season.

Part of Higdon’s success has 

come from his physical talents 
— he aims to be a balanced back 
like Adrian Peterson, who can 
be “quick and explosive” but also 
“lower (his) shoulder” on power 
runs — but the rest has come 
from increasing his patience.

“I can be very quick at times, 

and sometimes I can outrun my 
linemen,” Higdon said. “Knowing 
that I have that ability, me as a 
runner, I have to slow down and 
let things open up versus trying 
to make those things open up, 
and I think I’ve definitely gotten 
better at that.”

That newfound comfort has 

Higdon feeling like he’s in a 
good place, both athletically 
and academically. And in just 
two weeks, he will travel with 
Michigan to Iowa City to face 
the Hawkeyes, personifying the 
battle that went on in his head 21 
months ago.

Though 
he 
remembers 

his visits to Iowa fondly and 
thinks the trip will be “like a 
homecoming,” Higdon’s recent 
success has him feeling like that 
dilemma is far behind him.

“I’m a firm believer that I live 

with no regrets,” he said. “If I 
make a decision, I’m gonna make 
it and live with it. ... I’m extremely 
happy to be here and to be a part 
of the Go Blue Nation.”

‘M’ slumps to fifth at Big Ten meet

Before the Michigan men’s 

cross country team even left 
Minnesota 
this 
weekend, 
it 

was already planning on how 
to outperform itself at its next 
event, the Great Lakes Regionals. 

At 
this 
meet, 
though, 

the Wolverines fell short of 
expectations. Hoping to win a 
second straight Big Ten title, 
Michigan instead fell to fifth place. 

“The 
season’s 
not 
over 

yet — we’ve got more things 
that we can, and plan, on 
accomplishing,” said Michigan 
coach Kevin Sullivan. “Honestly, 
I didn’t have to say a whole lot 
(of positive encouragement to 
the team after the race). We had 
to recognize what happened. We 
had to come to the realization 
pretty quickly we have more 
opportunities to right the ship. 
We couldn’t, and can’t, wallow 
and feel the self-pity, because we 
have to get back to work.”

The team traveled to the 

Les Bolstand Golf Course in 
Minneapolis for the second 
time this year for the Big Ten 
Championships. The Wolverines 
navigated 
an 
8,000-meter 

course against 11 other Big Ten 
programs. Prior to 2015, the last 
time Michigan won a conference 
championship was in 1998. 

The 14th-ranked Wolverines, 

however, failed to achieve the 
title and instead finished with 
123 points, a large margin 
behind first-place Wisconsin. 
Adding to an already rough 
defeat, only one Wolverine 
managed to finish in the top-
10 athletes — redshirt junior 
Aaron Baumgarten who crossed 
the finish line at 24:49.0 for 
sixth place, only one second 
from breaking into the top-5 
runners. 

“(Baumgarten) 
is 
a 
great 

example of what hard work 
and fierce determination to be 

an elite athlete can really do,” 
Sullivan said. “He goes into 
these races with a chip on his 
shoulder because he wasn’t a 
highly recruited athlete coming 
out of high school. 

“For a lot of his early part of his 

career he’s looked at himself as an 
underdog. So he’s always wanted 
to prove people wrong, and he 
has. But he carries that feeling 
with him in every race situation.”

Baumgarten’s race strategy, 

much like the team’s, according 
to Sullivan, was to go on the 
defensive 
rather 
than 
the 

offensive. 
But 
opponents 

managed to start out strong and 
stay there, and Michigan was 
unable to work its way through 
the masses of runners like it 
typically does. 

“Something that we’ve prided 

on and learned is that we do 
really well with moving up 
through the field and beating 

guys in the latter half of the 
race,” Baumgarten said. “One 
thing we saw in this race in the 
results is that our places were 
stagnant and that we didn’t do 
what we usually have. We were 
sitting in the same spot instead 
of moving up through that.”

Many 
factors 
could 
have 

played into the Wolverines’ 
less-than-stellar 
performance. 

Sullivan mentioned that the Big 
Ten Championships were always 
a toss-up between Michigan, 
Michigan 
State, 
Indiana, 

Minnesota 
and 
Wisconsin. 

It just so happened that this 
weekend the Wolverines wound 
up on the bottom of the pile. 

Michigan 
also 
boasted 
a 

relatively inexperienced roster 
for the event. The lineup that 
Sullivan brought to the race 
consisted of nine athletes with 
only 
Baumgarten, 
redshirt 

junior Micah Beller and senior 

Connor 
Mora 
previously 

competing for the Big Ten 
title. The other six runners 
were redshirt freshman Jordy 
Hewitt, 
redshirt 
sophomore 

Kyle Kroon, redshirt juniors 
Austin Benoit, Billy Bund and 
graduate students Connor Herr 
and Ned Willig. 

Other top-25 performances 

included Mora in 19th (25:10.6) 
and Bund in 22nd (25.14.5). 

Despite everything, including 

the initial negative morale, the 
team is planning on overcoming 
its fall from graces. 

“Our team wasn’t pleased, but 

it’s not indicative of the talent 
on our team,” Baumgarten said. 
“I think this team is going to 
have an exceptional end to the 
season. We’re going to turn 
some heads and come back with 
some fire in our stomachs at the 
nationals course. 

“Don’t count us out.”

Late loss comes with 
promising look ahead

With hands on their heads and 

faces frozen in utter disbelief, 
the 
Michigan 
men’s 
soccer 

team’s body language told the 
whole story.

Its 2-0 lead had slipped away, 

as No. 1 Maryland scored three 
unanswered goals and handed 
the Wolverines a 3-2 loss in 
double overtime. Michigan was 
on the brink of one of college 
soccer’s biggest upsets of 2016, 
but had its opportunity firmly 
taken away.

The 
Wolverines’ 
state 
of 

shock is all too familiar. It was 
reminiscent of their recent 1-0 
defeat to Ohio State in another 
double-overtime thriller, and 
several other contests in which 
they squandered leads.

“I don’t know if anyone in 

the country has played more 
heartbreaking games than we 
have,” said Michigan coach 
Chaka Daley.

Though 
the 
game 
meant 

virtually nothing for the Big 
Ten standings, Michigan (1-6-
1 Big Ten, 3-10-4 overall) can 
take away many positives after 
its intense battle against the 
Terrapins (7-0-1, 15-0-2).

Its 
offensive 
attack 
— 

spearheaded 
by 
sophomore 

forward 
Francis 
Atuahene, 

sophomore midfielder Robbie 
Mertz and freshman forward 
Jack Hallahan — has finally 
found sparks. The Wolverines’ 
major 
scoring 
drought 
has 

subsided with seven of their 18 
goals scored over the past two 
contests. Hallahan and Mertz 
both tallied one goal each 
against Maryland and Atuahene 
added two assists to complement 
his team-leading six goals.

Evan Louro put forth a 

valiant effort as well. The junior 
goaltender logged 11 saves — just 
one short of the program record 

— while facing 14 shots on goal. 
Louro believes the Wolverines 
showed a large TV audience 
on the Big Ten Network their 
tournament potential.

Sunday’s matchup showcased 

Michigan’s many pieces slowly 
coming together, its ability to 
play competitively against the 
Maryland 
powerhouse 
and 

a possible spoiler role with 
something to prove in next 
week’s Big Ten Tournament that 
starts Saturday in a play-in game 
against Rutgers.

“I think a lot people saw what 

we can do against the number one 
team in the country,” Louro said. 
“And the Big Ten Tournament 
is a whole new season. Records 
don’t matter at that point, so I 
think we gained a little respect 
from everybody. Maybe things 
didn’t go our way, whether it was 
in our control or whether it was 
out of our control, but I think we 
got a lot of confidence from this 
and we can move on.”

Added 
redshirt 
junior 

midfielder 
Tyler 
Anderson: 

“(The game) shows that even 
given our record that we can play 
with the best. Hopefully right off 
the bat, we can get a win against 
Rutgers and go back against 
Maryland and show them that 
we can beat them. I think that’s 
going to be best for the team 
moving forward.”

Even with players lying on 

the turf, heads tucked into 
their jerseys, Daley says the 
Wolverines should possess a 
different mindset coming away 
from the heartbreaker.

“To have that type of spirit, 

fight and character in the last 
game of the season, when it’s not 
gone your way, against the best 
team in the country, is absolutely 
fantastic and absolutely superb,” 
Daley said. “I could not ask 
anything more from that locker 
room. They should not hang 
their heads.”

Goaltenders can’t save Michigan

It took 22 seconds for Vermont 

to score its game-winning goal 
against the Michigan hockey team 
Friday night. Freshman goaltender 
Hayden Lavigne, already used 
to early deficits, resorted to his 
calming exercises in an effort to 
maintain composure.

The 
freshman 
netminder 

remained 
relaxed 
and 
saved 

Vermont’s next seven shot attempts 
until Catamount forward Matt 
Alvaro scored at the 10:22 mark.

The rest of the Michigan hockey 

team, though, failed to muster any 
offense to support Lavigne’s effort 
in the crease — notching just eight 
shots on goal in the first, seven 
in the second and six in the final 
frame. It proved to be the trend of 
the weekend, as the Wolverines’ 
goaltenders notched 71 saves on 77 
shots, but still fell 3-0 to Vermont 
and 3-2 to Dartmouth.

“We just gotta be able to come 

out and play from the get-go,” said 
senior defenseman Nolan De Jong 
Friday night. “One thing I said after 
the game is that we gotta come 
in there with a little bit of pride. 
You don’t come to Michigan to be 
average, and (Friday night) was far 
below average for our standards.”

In the second period Friday 

night, sophomore forward Brendan 
Warren hit the post but it was to no 
avail. 
Michigan 

had five power-
play opportunities, 
but 
managed 

just 
five 
shots 

with 
this 
one-

man 
advantage 

and couldn’t find 
paydirt 
on 
any 

of them. Though 
Lavigne 
turned 

away 39 of 42 
shots he faced, his 
offense attempted 
just 21 shots on goal. 

Saturday night, when facing 

Dartmouth, it was more of the 
same. The Wolverines’ attack 
fared better, scoring two power-
play goals. Winborg scored his 

first career goal in the game’s third 
minute. Forward Alex Kile tied up 
the score in the third, on his second 
goal of the season. Yet these bits 
of offense were not enough, as 
a late opportunity by Big Green 
forward Troy Cema broke the 

stalemate with 49 
seconds left. Once 
again, 
another 

impressive effort 
by 
a 
Michigan 

goaltender 
went 

to 
waste. 
This 

time, 
it 
was 

freshman 
Jack 

LaFontaine who 
stopped 32 shots 
on 35 attempts.

After 
the 

departure of many 

players from Michigan top-ranked 
scoring offense last season, early 
growing pains were to be expected. 
Excellent goaltending, though, has 
kept the Wolverines in games.

But 
Michigan’s 
goaltenders 

can’t save every shot, and with a 
struggling offense, the early goals 
have proved costly.

In the two matchups over 

the weekend, Michigan allowed 
only one power play goal on 21 
shot attempts.

The Wolverines’ goaltenders 

continue to thrive while their 
offense has generated just 18 goals 
in seven games. The three players 
— Lavigne, LaFontaine and senior 
Zach Nagelvoort — rank sixth 
nationally in save percentage with 
a .934 clip. The offense though, 
continues to struggle. It sits 
second to last in the nation with a 
39.5 percent Corsi average, which 
measures the percentage of shots 
taken compared to an opponent.

In a season filled with close 

calls and heart-breakers, there has 
been one constant for Michigan: 
the success of its goaltenders. And 
this weekend was no different.

Michigan once again fell just 

short.
