SWATTED BY THE SPARTANS

'U' called on
to sever ties
with Russell

Michigan forward DeShawn Sims was a huge presence in the paint, turning in almost half of Michigan's total offensive output. But his game-high 18 points wasn't enough for
the Wolverines, who lost 54-42 to No. 9 Michigan State last night in Crisler Arena. For more coverage of the game, see Sports, Page 8.

Athletic apparel
company allegedly
fired employees who
tried to unionize
By KYLE SWANSON
Daily Staff Reporter
The University's Advisory
Committee on Labor Standards
and Human Rights is calling on
University officials to end their
licensing agreements with Rus-
sell Corporation, an athletic
apparel company that has come
under criticism for allegedly firing
employees for unionizing.
In a letter sent Monday to Kris-
ten Ablauf, director of licensing for'
the University, the committee cited
practices from two of the compa-
ny's facilities that allegedly failed to
properly communicate and respect
the right to association.
The committee is asking the
University not to renew its licens-
ing agreements with Russell Corp.
when the current license expires
on March 31.
The committee's letter to Ablauf
said it would not be advisable to
continue a relationship with the
Russell Corp. because the compa-
ny has not respected the employ-
ees' right to association.
"Even if top management at Rus-
sell firmly and strongly believes in
respect for every human being and
respects the right to association,
the committee concluded they did

a poor job of communicating those
ideals to people at the two plants and
of implementing/enforcing appro-
priate practices," the letter said.
The letter recommended the
University sever ties with Russell
Corp. and that monitoring the sit-
uation closely would not be suffi-
cient to prevent further instances.
"Because of the company's pre-
vious failure to adhere to its own
standards of conduct, we do not
feel that continuing the license,
even under strict monitoring of
any new code of conduct, is appro-
priate," the letter said.
University spokeswoman Kelly
Cunningham said the commit-
tee's letter was received and will
be reviewed by the Office of the
President and the Office of the
General Counsel.
Russell Corp. has been linked to
two separate instances of abusing
workers' freedom to association.
The original investigation by
the Worker Rights Consortium, a
University affiliate that is paid to
monitor anylabor or human rights
violations by Universitylicensees,
found that Russell Corp. dismissed
virtually all of its unionized
employees in its Jerzees de Cholo-
ma facility in Choloma, Honduras,
in March, shortly after a union
was formed there.
Russell Corp. had originally
refused to comply with WRC's
investigation and rejected remedi-
ation plans to reinstate the union-,
ized employees. But the company
ultimately relented and agreed to

these scholarships are not available

organization that prepares students

INTERDISCIPLINARY FACULTY
Hiring plan adds first 25

Despite freezes
elsewhere, 'U' forges
ahead, filling tenure-
track positions
By CAITLIN SCHNEIDER
Daily StaffReporter
While many universities are
freezing hiring because of an unsta-
ble economic climate, the Univer-
sity is pushing through the first
phase of its $30 million initiative to

hire 100 new faculty members.
In 2007, the Utiversity launched
the program to create tenure-track
positions in interdisciplinary fields.
A year into the program, 25 positions
had been approved and the search
for individual faculty is underway.
Those 25 positions will be from
six specific interdisciplinary groups
suggested by faculty members to
the Office of the Provost.
Despite the suffering economy,
University Provost Teresa Sullivan
said the initiative hasn't slowed.
"Over half of all American col-
leges and universities now have a

hiring freeze," Sullivan said. "So
people who are on the job market
this year are being funneled to an
increasingly smaller set of schools.
We're one of those schools, so it's
actually good for us - perversely."

STUDENT GOVERNMNT ECTIONS
LSA Student Government to
drop party labels from ballot

Khaled Abu Toameh presents "Another Angle: Reporting Conflict in the Middle East" in the Michigan League last night.
Israeli-Arab journalist paints bleak
picture of situation in Middle East

Officials say they
want election to be
about the issues
By DANIEL STRAUSS
Daily StaffReporter
Last night LSA Student Gov-
ernment President Leslie Zaikis
announced that in the next round
of student government elections,
members wouldn't run with any
party affiliation.
"We've decided as a govern-

ment that we are going to run on
a non-partisan election," Zaikis
announced. "That means we will
not be running with the two parties
in this election."
Zaikis's announcement came
after the recent formation of the
Michigan Vision Party and word
that the Michigan Action Party, the
most powerful Michigan Student
Assembly party, was going to dis-
solve. She said that the announce-
ment also came after a number of
discussions between the heads of
LSA-SG.
"We have talked with both par-

ties to ensure that they will respect
our wishes to run a non-partisan
campaign," Zaikis explained at
the meeting. "We don't want to get
caught up in the party politics."
Previously, candidates for stu-
dent government ran either as
independents or as part of a party
like the Michigan Action Party. In
past years, candidates who were
affiliated with a particular party
' received campaign assistance dur-
ing the election.
Though LSA-SG candidates will
no longer have a party to help them,

Abu Toameh tells
crowd that there are
no viable solutions
By ELYANA TWIGGS
For the Daily
Israeli-Arab journalist, Khaled
Abu Toameh told a packed Vanden-
berg Room at the Michigan League
that there's no simple solution to
neutralize the conflict in the Mid-
dle East, calling both a two-state
and one-state solution impractical.
The event, called "Another
Angle: Reporting Conflict in the

Middle East" was co-sponsored by
the American Movement for Israel
and Israel Initiating Dialogue,
Education and Advocacy, two pro-
Israel campus groups.
Abu Toameh said though a two-
state solution to the conflict is
ideal, it would not be viable.
"The concept of the two-state
solution is wonderful," he said.
"Although I think it's not practical
and will never work."
He added that the power strug-
gle between Hamas and Fatah in
the West Bank and Gaza is hinder-
ing the chance for peace.
"We are stuck, there's no way
to move forward." he said. "This is

not a power strugglebetween good
guys and bad guys. It is between
bad guys and bad guys who are
fighting over money or power."
Abu Toameh also said to resolve
the conflict, both Israel and the
Palestinian territories would have
to make internal changes them-
selves first.
"The change has to happen
from within, you can't send the
marines or armed soldiers to
enforce democracy," he said. "I
would focus on repairing conflict
of Arabs and Jew within Israel."
In addition to sharing his opin-
ions on the conflict, Abu Toameh

MONDAY: TUESDAY: WENSA
In Other Ivory Towers Campus Characters Explained
Why blue hasn't gone green

THURSDAY: FRIDAY:
Before You Were Here Photos of the Week

For the past 15 years,
Roaring Spring Paper Prod-
uct Company has provided
most of the blue books on
campus. Three years ago,
the company introduced
a new product: the green
book - a more environmen-
tal friendly version of the
blue book.
Despite campus's taste for
green products, Women's
Studies lecturer Michelle
McClellan said that most
students in her class still opt
for the blue option.
"It's probably about
one-third green books and
two-thirds blue books at
this point," she said. "If
anything, I prefer .green
books."
If green books, which are
made from 30 percent recy-
CRIME NOTES

cled paper, are better for the
environment then why don't
more students use them?
One reason could be
cost. The green books cost
70 cents, which is slightly
more than their blue broth-
er, which cost 65 cents at the
Michigan Union bookstore.
"I like the idea of green
books, and I'm willing to
pay the extra five cents or
whatever for it," LSA junior
David Keegan said.
LSA senior Miesha Mera-
ti said that given the choice,
and "given that green books
are more recycled - I'd
rather buy green books."
Jim Lucey, general man-
ager for Roaring Spring
Paper Product Company,
said the move towards
"greener" products came

from consumers.
"There's a pretty big
demand for recycled prod-
ucts," he said.
Some professors nowurge
their students to use green
books, but don't require it.
"My Philosophy of Global
Justice class recommend-
ed we use green books,"
LSA sophomore Mary Van
Houten said.
Lucey said there are no
current plans to phase out
production of blue books
in favor of green books. He
said such a decision would
depend on whether con-
sumers bought green books
at a greater rate than blue
books.
Right now, that's just not
the case, he said.

Local CFA firefighter David Tree shares his water with an injured Australian Koala at Mirboo North after wildfires swept
through the region on Monday, Feb. 9, 2009. The death toll stood at 181 on Monday.
Australia wildfire death
toll expected to pass 200

As a few fires still
burn, recovery
teams start work
HEALESVILLE, Australia (AP)
- The high death toll from hun-
dreds of wildfires across southeast-
ern Australia has forced authorities
to re-examine an accepted survival
strategy when blazes threaten: Get
out early or hunker down and fight.
Many people waited too long and
perished as they tried to escape the
weekend infernos.
"People need to understand that
a late departure is the most deadly,"
fire chief Paul Rees said.
Recovery teams moving into
burned out towns in Victoria state
found charred bodies on roadsides
and in wrecked cars - grim signs
of futile attempts to flee the raging
wildfires fed by 60 mph (100 kph)
winds, record heat and drought.
The number of deaths was expect-
ed to surpass 200, and a few fires
were still burning.
"The clear evidence is that the
most dangerous place to be is on
the road," Rees, Victoria's country
fire authority chief, told reporters
Tuesday.
The scale of the disaster has
shocked a nation that endures dead-
ly firestorms every few years.

Authorities defended their prep-
arations and actions during the fires
that swept southeastern Australia
on Saturday, saying the extreme
weather conditions made catastro-
phe almost inevitable.
But they agreed that the "stay
and defend" policy, under which
homeowners remain to protect
their properties from fire, needed
to be reviewed.
"It is the application of that pol-
icy and a lack of an alternative that
we need to work on," Rees said.
Evacuation is not mandatory
in high-risk areas, and Australia's
wildfire services largely comprise
volunteers who lack the resources
to protect every home.
In Victoria, there is no formal
alert system to warn of approaching
wildfires, though the Country Fire
Authority distributes advice and
updates on its Web site and through
radio broadcasts.
One expert suggested Australia's
shifting demographics could be
partly to blame for the scale of the
tragedy.
MarkAdamsoftheBushfireCoop-
erative Research Center told Austra-
lian Broadcasting Corp. Television
that many urbanites who moved to
city outskirts have no experience
with wildfires and rely wholly on the
fire service for help. But families who
have lived in the area for generations

are prepared to battle blazes them-
selves, Adams said.
Victoria state Premier John
Brumby said he asked Prime Minis-
ter Kevin Rudd to consider setting
up a national emergency fire warn-
ingsystem months ago.
But officials agree that in the
worst conditions, the direction
and intensity of fires can change
so quickly that sirens, e-mails and
other warning systems are not
effective.
The wildfires outside Melbourne,
Australia's second largest city,
destroyed more than 750 homes,
left 5,000 people homeless, and
burned 1,100 square miles (2,850
square kilometers) of land, the fire
authority said.
While the official death toll stood
at 181 Tuesday evening, Brumby
said there were an additional 50
bodies that the coroner had not
identified and were not included in
the official tally.
"This is going to be a significant
number. It will exceed 200 deaths,"
he said.
One elderly resident of Heales-
ville, who asked not to be identified
by name, said he escapedbefore the
blaze engulfed his home but he lost
two friends.
"It was too fast," said the white-
bearded man, tears streaming down
his cheek and his chin quivering.

wage concessions

Gov. Jennifer Granholm's
administration wants to discuss
possible wage concessions from
state employees to help fix budget
deficits, labor union representa-

Officials from two of the five
unions representing state employ-

Michigan's public universities

The state could face a possible

fiscal year. It also could get a cou-
ple billion dollars from a federal
stimulus package next year and
even more this fiscal year, but the
Granholm administration doesn't
know yet how much is coming or
what they'll be able to spend it on.
The governor already has said
her budget proposal will contain
deep cuts, even with the stimulus

President Nicolas Sarkozy paid

over lingering resentment about
France's opposition to the war and
positioning his country to cash in
on lucrative arms and oil deals.
The one-day visit, part of a Per-

Obama administration is preparing
to draw down the 144,000-strong
U.S. military force and signaled
France's intention to play a diplo-
matic role in a region dominated by
the United States.
"I want to underscore France's

bilitation of its infrastructures,"
Sarkozy told reporters after meet-
ing Iraqi President Jalal Talabani.
"Our collaboration has no limits."

16 people killed in

At least 16 patients being treated
at a makeshift hospital in the north-

fighters of killing 19 other civilians
fleeing the area.
The United Nations, meanwhile,
said it was outraged by the "unnec-
essary" deaths of hundreds of peo-
ple inside rebel territory and urged
both sides to avoid fighting in civil-
ian areas.

The government accuses the
Tamil Tiger rebels of holding civil-
ians hostage in the war zone to use
as human shields against the mili-
tary's offensive. The rebels deny the
accusation.

Wal-Mart to cut

Wal-Mart Stores Inc. will cut
700 to 800 jobs at its northwestern

makes other operational chang-
es, the world's largest retailer

The cuts are in Wal-Mart's real

David Tovar said. Wal-Mart would
not say how many jobs will be cut in
each segment.
Tovar said employees will be
told of the cuts in the next couple of
weeks and there was no immediate
plan to make other positions within
Wal-Mart available to them.
But he said the company also
plans to add jobs at its New York

this year - a figure that includes
hires at new stores.

Iranian president responds to Obama's call for dialogue

Ahmadijejad says
he is open to
talks on nuclear
weapons, terrorism
TEHRAN, Iran (AP) - Iran's
hard-line president told crowds
celebrating the Islamic revolu-
tion's anniversary yesterday that
the country is ready for talks with
the United States, the strongest
signal yet that Tehran welcomes
President Barack Obama's calls for
dialogue'
President Mahmoud Ahmadine-
jad made the comments ina speech
to hundreds of thousands celebrat-
ing the 30th anniversary of the
revolution, which ousted the U.S-
backed shah and installed rule
by hard-line Muslim clerics. The
event led to a collapse in relations
between the two countries and
years of enmity.
As usual at such gatherings,
there were chants of "Death to
America," along with the burning
of U.S. and Israeli flags. But the
chanting stopped as Ahmadinejad
spoke of dialogue with the United
States, and the firebrand president
refrained from the denunciations
of America that often mark his
speeches.

Since Obama's election, Irani-
an leaders have struck a cautious
tone over his campaign promises
to open a dialogue with Tehran,
signaling that the government was
undecided on how to respond. Yes-
terday, Ahmadinejad made it clear
Iran is prepared to talk, citing ter-
rorism, the elimination of nuclear
weapons, restructuring the JJ.N.
Security Council and fighting drug
trafficking as possible areas for
discussion.
"The Iranian nation is ready for
talks (with the U.S.), but in a fair
atmosphere with mutual respect,"
Ahmadinejad told the crowds in
Tehran's Freedom Square.
His comments came the day
after Obama said his administra-
tion was looking for opportuni-
ties to engage Iran and pledged to
rethink Washington's relationship
with Tehran.
But Ahmadinejad also
declared that Iran is now a
"superpower" - pointing to the
recent launch of the first locally
made satellite into space - and
made clear it expects tobe treat-
ed as an equal.
"If you really want to fight
terrorism, come and cooper-
ate with the Iranian nation,
which is the biggest victim of
terrorism so that terrorism is
eliminated. ... If you want to

confront nuclear weapons ... you
need to stand beside Iran so it can
introduce a correct path to you,"
he said.
Ahmadinejad did not elaborate,
but in the past he and other Iranian
leaders have criticized the U.S. for
its nuclear arsenal.
His speech comes as he begins
campaigning for a second term.
He faces a formidable challenge in
the June election from Iran's top
reformist politician, former Presi-
dent Mohammad Khatami, who
entered the race over the weekend.
Khatami has supported improving
ties with the West.
Asked about Ahmadinejad's
comments, Secretary of State Hil-
lary Clinton said the Iranian gov-
ernment has an opportunity "to
unclench their fist and to begin
a serious and responsible discus-

sion about a range of matters."
"We still persist in our view
that Iran should not obtain nuclear
weapons, that it would be a very
unfortunate course for them to
pursue, and we hope there will be
opportunity in the future for us to
develop a better understanding of
one another and to work out away
of talking that would produce posi-
tive results for the people of Iran,"
she said.
Tehran and Washington sev-
ered relations nearly three decades
ago after the 1979 Iranian revolu-
tion and the takeover of the U.S.
Embassy in Tehran by hard-line
Iranian students.
But relations deteriorated even
further after the Sept. 11 attacks
when former President George W.
Bush declared Iran belonged to an
"axis of evil." Ahmadinejad wid-

ened that gap after he was elected
in 2005 and defied the U.S. and its
allies by pursuing Iran's controver-
sial nuclear program.
The U.S. believes Iran is secretly
trying to pursue nuclear weapons,
but Iran has denied this accusa-
tion, saying its program is solely
for peaceful purposes such as elec-
tricity.
Years of negotiations between
Tehran and Europe over its nucle-
ar program have failed to make any
breakthroughs, with Iran repeat-
edly rejecting U.S. and European
economic incentives to suspend
parts of its program and brushing
off U.N. sanctions.
But Washington and Tehran
did cooperate closely in the 2001
ousting of Afghanistan's Tali-
ban - before Bush's axis of evil
speech.

New city policy will increase and expand recycling program
The city of Ann Arbor wants to save the world, one recycled
cardboard box at a time. Right now, one of the biggest
obstacles preventing Ann Arbor from being the environ-
mental savior it wants to be are private businesses' low recycling
rates. But a new city proposal will make recycling easier and
cheaper for private businesses in Ann Arbor by streamlining the
process. Viewed alongside other efforts to increase recycling in
the city and on campus, this proposal is just another example of
Ann Arbor's efforts to stay at the forefront of recycling and the

city should swiftly adopt it.
The city of Ann Arbor is expected to
finalize a plan later this month that will
overhaul the way that businesses in Ann
Arbor recycle and dump trash. Under the
proposal, the city government will con-
tract a single company to remove trash
for all city businesses. This would make
it cheaper for business owners to recycle
paper, cardboard and plastic, rather than
just throwing these things in the garbage.
And though the city doesn't expect to save
any money with the new program, the lack
of financial benefits are less important
than the community's commitment to pro-
tecting the environment.
It's a needed measure, especially con-
sidering the vast discrepancy between
how much Ann Arbor residents and busi-
nesses recycle. Residential recycling rates
are above 50 percent, which means 50 per-
cent of waste produced is being recycled or
composted. Commercial diversion rates,
however, are stalled at a 20 percent. With
this new plan, the city could easily reach
its 50 percent goal for businesses.
Some business owners have expressed
concerns about the decreased availability
of recycling options the new policy will
cause. But that's a weak argument. Instead
of expanding options, the city is focusing
on cost. As the city increases the ease of
recycling, the garbage output of businesses
will decrease. That means businesses won't

have to pay as much for trash removal. The
city, for its part, needs to make sure they
choose a responsible company to handle
the recycling.
But more important than the economic
benefits for businesses are the environ-
mental benefits. Recycling saves trees and
decreases the amount of waste that ends
up in landfills. In light of that, City Council
should move quickly to approve and imple-
ment the new rule.
Students are taking an active interest in
recycling, too. Last month, LSA freshman
Alex Levine introduced a proposal to City
Council to make No. 6 plastic cups - like
the red ones littering frat house lawns -
recyclable.
Unfortunately, Levine's proposal hasn't
made much headway because, though the
idea has come up before, the city hasn't
been able to find the necessary resources
to expand the list of items that can be recy-
cled. As City Council implements its new
recycling program, now is a perfect time to
step up the search for options to make Ann
Arbor more green.
Ann Arbor is known for its efforts to
help the environment, and the city should
be taking active steps to earn that reputa-
tion. No matter who's paying for it, that
cardboard box is more useful to the world
at a recycling plant than it is sitting in a
landfill.

Driven to break the law

Driving in Michigan is usually
a pretty terrible experience.
During the warmer months,
every road seems
like it's infested
with potholes or
under construction,
causing lengthy
delays. In the win-
ter, positively Arc-
tic weather brings
slippery roads and
blinding snow- ROBERT
storms thatresult in SOAVE
accidents and even
worse traffic delays.
And on top of the
road conditions themselves, Michigan
drivers have to make sure they don't
violate traffic laws, because with the
state's draconian driver responsibility
fees, you end up paying twice.
These fees came into existence
because of the Granholm-backed Driv-
er Responsibility Law of 2003. The
intention of the law was to make roads
safer while bringing in more money
for the state government. Six years
later, only one of these intentions has
become a reality: there's no evidence
that Michigan roads are safer, but the
government has certainly profited.
The Driver Responsibility Law
imposes a fee on certain offenses in
addition to the ticket itself. These
range from the understandable $1,000
fee for drunken driving to the purely
ridiculous $200 fee for not having
insurance or proof of insurance. These
fees are in addition to any other fine a
driver incurs for breaking the law.
And while such fees were never
desirable, many Michigan drivers just
can't afford to pay extra during the
economy's downturn. That's because
in the long run, driver responsibil-
ity fees disproportionately harm low-
income people who have to prioritize
their expenses and can't afford to be

hit with extra fees. Regrettably, not
everyone in the state can afford to
have car insurance, even though they
need to drive in order to have jobs and
make money. Well, the fee for not hav-
ing car insurance is $200, and if they
don't pay at least some of the fee with-
in 60 days, their license is suspended.
Getting your license reinstated is an
extra fee that some can't afford to
pay, so these motorists end up driving
without a license, which will net them
another fee.
This cycle offees puts economically-
disadvantaged drivers in a deeper and
deeper hole because to make money
at a job, they have to drive. In a Feb. 8
article by the Lansing Bureau entitled
"Michigan's fees on uninsured motor-
ists only compound problem for strug-
gling taxpayers", St. Joseph District
Judge Jeffrey Middleton said it's "not
uncommon... to see defendants who
owe $5,000 to $10,000 to the state.
Unless they win the lottery, these peo-
ple have little hope of ever regaining
their lawful driving privileges."
If these fees are especially bad for
people in light of the economy, why
exactly do we still have them? The
purpose was to deter dangerous driv-
ing and make some money for the state.
Well, there's no evidence that traf-
fic infractions are deterred because
of these fees. In a Grand Haven Tri-
bune article from Jan. 19, 2007 titled
"Michigan's driver responsibility law
faces criticism," Rockford Republican
Rep. Tom Pearce said of the law, "has it
done anything to impact safety in the
state of Michigan as far as our roads?
We're not hearing that." This was two
years ago, when the heavily-criticized
driver responsibility fees came under
closer scrutiny and some lawmakers
support eliminating them. But in the
end, nothing came of this talk, and
today driver responsibility fees are
still -a terrible burden to all drivers,

especially the poor.
If the fees aren't promoting safety
and many Michigan drivers just can't
afford to pay them, then there's only
one reason they still exist - the state is
reliant on revenue from them. Indeed,
the state government rakes in $110
million from driver responsibility fees.
And at a time when the state govern-
ment is uncomfortably looking around
for ways to afford its budget, it seems
unlikely that Granholm will actually
urge lawmakers to abolish them.
Extra traffic fines

income drivers.
Rather than making a vague appeal
to driver responsibility, it is the state
government that needs to take respon-
sibility for the consequences of this
law. Cashing in on Michigan drivers'
misfortunes is inexcusable and per-
petuates a cycle where those who are
least able to pay end up with the most
substantial debts. At a minimum, the
fees for not having insurance should
be scrapped. Drivers who can't afford
insurance will be even less likely to
buy it ifthey have to pay an outrageous
fine for not having had it in the first
place. The state needs to end its finan-
cial dependence upon revenue from
driver responsibility fees because they
prey on the least-advantaged econom-
ic level of society. Driving in Michigan
might never be perfect,but it shouldn't
come with such unfair costs.

Students learn a lot as interns, but they
also learn a great deal through the process

positions exist and which organizations
are in their field of interest. By conducting
a search, students also learn the sizes and
sectors of potential employers for which
they will be a fit.
Just as the writing and analytical
skills gained through coursework will be
tapped for a lifetime, so is the ability to
understand and navigate the job/intern-

experienced, confident and connected a
job seeker becomes.
While Veith is correct in pointing out
socioeconomic differences may play into
who may avail themselves to an internship
service, it is the investment of effort that
ultimately distinguishes those who will
have internships from those who won't.
Don't be fooled - writing a check for an

occasional correspondent at10:30 p.m.
for "The Daily Show," is the
latest in this storied tradi- Cmedy Cetral
tion of solo jaunts with his
new Comedy Central show "Important Things
With Demetri Martin."
"Important Things" builds from the stan-
dard variety-show playbook: Each episode

revolves around a specific, esoteric theme
- the first two episodes focus on "Tim-
ing" and "Power" - that Martin explores
through traditional stand-up comedy, songs
and sketches. The show's format is nothing
unique, but Martin makes the most of its nar-
row restraints.
Visually, "Important Things" borrows a
lot of its cues from Martin's stand-up, and it's
easy to see his influence in the show's mini-
malist style. To cut between scenes, the show
uses footage of Martin holding a remote made
out of paper backed by "Juno"-like musi-
cal cues. Arbitrary captions - like one that
labels Martin as "Demetri Martin: Person"
- are also common. While the show's visuals
can border on obnoxiously quaint, it manages
to moderate itself enough to avoid becoming
too grating.
Predictably, one of the show's greatest
strengths is Martin's solo comedy. His dead-
pan demeanor translates well, and his one-
liners ("I wonder if there were any Goths in
Gothic times"), drawings and songs are just
as sharp. The show's quick pace also keeps all
these segments in check. Hopping between
longer sketches, stand-up and shorter inter-
stitial bits, the show tries to avoid sitting on
any gag for longer than it needs to, keeping it
from dragging.

The show's sketches aren't anywhere as
consistent, though. Martin's skills as an
actor are limited, and having him anchor the
sketches, which make up the bulk of the show,
doesn't work nearly as well as it should. One
sketch in the first episode, in which Martin
plays an actor with bad timing who can't get
angry when he needs to, has some potential in
its premise. But, with Martin's inexperience
as an actor, the sketch never really finds its
bearings.
Still, not all of the sketches require the
most from Martin, and the ones that put the
premise ahead of the comedian himself tend
to work best. The sketches that make the most
of Martin's absurd brand of humor - like one
that features Martin as a time-traveling jani-
tor who romances various historical figures -
tend to work best.
In the post-"Daily Show" career qual-
ity barometer, "Important Things" falls more
toward Colbert's critical success than Lewis
Black's ("Lewis Black's Root of All Evil")
inconsistency. It gives viewers something
that's reflective of Martin's best qualities with-
out watering his act down for public consump-
tion. It's not always as polished as it should
and could be, but the strength of Martin and
his material makes "Important Things" a wor-
thy addition to the Comedy Central lineup.

not meant to be plausible or make
any sense. But the scene plays out
squeaky-clean, well-lit and overly
childish, and its humor is ruined
by the poor staging: It turns out
he's in Epcot, not Rome! This stag-
ing problem is what's ultimately
wrong with "The Pink Panther 2,"
the latest Martin-led pillaging of
the Peter Sellers legacy.
"Pink Panther 2," the sequel to
the 2006 Pink Panther re-start
that also featured Martin, plays
like a series of decent jokes ruined
by amateur directing. Martin is a

that Martin is stuck in another
chintzy mystery-comedy, and it's
holding him back.

of course, the clodhopping Clou-

funny, right? Clouseau proceeds to

dumbed way down.
Still, Steve Martin's legacy is
pretty much secure, like it or not.
The typical complaint about the
once wild-and-crazy guy is that
he's become a sell-out. "Bring-
ing Down the House," "Looney
Tunes: Back in Action" and the
"Cheaper by the Dozen" films
are sufficient evidence to argue
that point. But that doesn't mean
Martin was any less funny in
those flicks. Dirty old man jokes
are always funny, even in a rehash

Granted, Martin's a witty guy,

welcome. Look for the "no ogling"

Animal Planet beats a dead horse

By CAROLYN KLARECKI
DailyArts Writer
Who doesn't want to travel the
world and ride horses for a living?
Thoroughbred racing has been
the wealthy man's pastime for
the past century
and is consid-
ered by some to
be among the Jckys
classiest orga-
nized sports. So Fridays at
it's natural to 9 P.M.
assume jockeys Animal Planet
are sophisti-
cated men with
adventurous lifestyles and easy
jobs. Animal Planet's "Jockeys"
aims to debunk these myths by
offering a glimpse into the harsh
reality of the profession. Unfortu-
nately, the myths are more enter-
taining than the truth.
"Jockeys" is filmed documen-
tary-style, following seven pro-
fessional jockeys through their
successes and failures. The show
focuses mostly on Joe Talamo,
the arrogant young gun; Aus-

tralian newcomer Kayla Stra,
the undiscovered talent; Jockey
Hall of Famer Mike Smith, who
is determined to stay on top; and
his girlfriend, Chantal Suther-
land, a successful jockey in Cana-
da who is trying to break into the
tougher, male-dominated Ameri-
can circuit.
Apparently, being a jockey
doesn't just consist of sitting on
a horse, steering it every once in
awhile and hoping it's fast enough.
"Jockeys" makes sure to clarify
the fact that these professionals
are skilled athletes and racing is
an extremely dangerous sport.
The opening credits of "Jockeys"
prepares audiences for a thrill-
ing and action-packed view of a
treacherous profession, featuring
majestic shots of sprinting horses
and dramatic silhouettes of jock-
eys. To top it off, Kanye West's
"Stronger" is used as the theme
song. It quickly becomes clear,
however, that "Jockeys" consists
mostly of lengthy interviews. All
the promised action is contained
within a single race, which is over

ARTS IN BRIEF

EP Review
o From strength to boredom
Wild Years
Where'd You Go
Self-released
Where'd You Go is a new three-song EP of
folk ballads by Wild Years, a talented group of
Ann Arbor musicians. On the first track, "Fan-
tasies," frontman Alex Itkin sings about the
desire to fall in love and the sorrow brought
about by being alone. The song starts sim-
ply enough with gentle guitar picking and an

understated drum beat perfect for foot-tapping.
About halfway through, Itkin sheds the skin of
the solitary man and morphs into a small choir
thanks to multi-tracking. The addition ofbanjo,
mandolin and violin propels "Fantasies" into
its gripping chorus. It's a peaceful explosion
capable of raising goose bumps and demanding
repeat listens.
The next track, "I'm Not Coming Out," is a
slight disappointment after the pleasant con-
tagiousness of "Fantasies." Itkin's voice is a
little too echoey, overpowering the instru-
ments. Reverb effect works well in the chorus,
but during the verses it makes Itkin seem like
he's bored - his voice doesn't change in pitch
and there's no emotion to carry the lyrics. It's

not terrible, but it relies on overproduction as a
crutch to make up for the lack of variation.
"Untitled (Band-aid)" follows, bringing the
EP to an unimpressive end. The song begins
with a tame "1, 2, 3, 4" and dissonant violin,
giving it a haunted old country feel. The gui-
tar plays softly as Itkin begins to sing. The lyr-
ics are dull and cliche, staggering along with
lines like, "Snowballs melting in this hot sum-
mer weather." Itkin sounds bored again,.and it
quickly gets repetitive.
Where'd You Go is a good effort, but the last
two songs have a sense of indifference that
puts a damper on the whole affair. Fortunately,
"Fantasies" makes the EP worth a listen with
its sticky, head-nodding goodness.

Director to talk youth activism

Pollock will discuss
his film about teen
politicians tonight
By MALLORY BEBERMAN
For the Daily
If the November 2008 elec-
tion wasn't enough evidence of
America's politically active youth,
Jason Pollock's documentary "The
Youngest Candidate" is proof
American teenagers are not afraid
to take a stand and make a differ-
ence in their communities.
The feature-length, non-parti-
san film was written and directed
by the 27-year-old filmmaker, who
has worked closely with Acad-
emy Award-winning filmmaker
Michael Moore.
Pollock's film will be screened
tonight at 7 p.m. at The Michigan
Theater, and Pollock will speak
after the showing.
Pollock assisted Moore in the
creation of "Fahrenheit 9/11" and
accompanied him on "Slacker

their fundraiser because there's not
extra money sitting somewhere, so
they have to raise it," Seiler said.
"The one scholarship that Panhel
gives for graduate school is bud-
geted to be the same, so there are
no plans to increase it."
Seiler said each chapter in the
Panhellenic Association has dif-
ferent scholarships available to its
members. But these scholarships,
which come from the chapters'
national organizations, are in most
cases not available to new mem-
bers, making first-year member-
ship costs expensive.
"Theyhave emergencyaid some-
times available as well as scholar-
ships, but they're not going to offer
it to people they don't know any-
thing about yet," Seiler said. "You'll
have to have at least made a com-
mitment to the sorority of which
you've joined and completed you're
new member term, so they know
you're goingto be there."
According to the Panhellenic
Association's website, dues for
sororities in Panhel vary on an

Uprising" - a tour through 60 cit-
ies across the country to encourage
voter participation for the 2004
presidential election.
After working on "Slacker Upris-
ing," Pollock said in an interview with
The MichiganDaily that he "was real-
ly inspired to getyoung people to vote
inthe2008 November election."
That experience is what Pollock
said generated the idea for "The
Youngest Candidate," which fol-
lows the campaigns of four teen-
agers who ran for public office in
November 2008. After three years
of research, Pollock found about SO
teenage politicians who were suc-
cessfully elected to office.
He said the major reason so few
teenagers run for office is that most
people don't know they can run.
When choosing the charac-
ters for his film, Pollock said he
searched for "funny and exciting
and interesting characters ... that
were cool, successful and witty."
The four teenagers - Ytit Chau-
han, George Monger, Raul De
Jesus and Tiffany Tupper - were
all between the ages of 18 and 20.
individual chapter basis, ranging
from $900 to $2,300 in annual fees
for first-year members.
The Junior Panhellenic Council
also provides merit scholarships for
first year members of Panhel. Last
year, these Junior Panhel scholarship
funds, which are garnered through a
fundraiser, totaled $9,275.
Panhelalso provides a$500schol-
arship to a graduating Panhel mem-
ber going on to graduate school.
Seilersaidthese scholarships pro-
vided by Junior Panhel and Panhel
are based solely on merit. There are
no explicitly designated need-based
scholarships or financial aid avail-
able from the Office of Greek Life.
"We have no way of checking aid.
We don't have access to their per-
sonal financial (information)," Seiler
said. "We're not a financial aid office
so we're not equipped to collect that
information and evaluate it. We
don't ask for how muchthey need."
While Seiler said she is disap-
pointed the Office of Greek Life is
not able to offer need-based schol-
arships, she said there is just not
money available for them to pro-
vide such funds.
"That's the way it is with lots of
things in life," Seiler said. "I'd love
to have every student interested
"I have no problem working for any
newspaper that provides me with
a free platform to write whatever I
want."
Abu Toameh also discussed his
unique position as an Arab living
in Israel.
"Israeli-Arab citizens feel as
though they are being discriminat-
ed against. They are regarded as a
cancer, an enemy from within," he

Running in mayoral, city council
and school board elections, Pollock
said the young candidates were
exactly what he was looking for.
"I think my characters are all
little Obamas," Pollock said and
added he wanted to "find kids who
were doing this outside the box."
Pollock said part of what make
his characters so awe-inspiring is
that they "know what it means to
have to sacrifice in their lives."
While none of the four teenag-
ers won seats in their prospective
elections, Pollock said they have
all become public figures in their
communities and will continue to
take advantage of their growing
public influence.
He said the teenagers' cam-
paigns have encouraged their fel-
low contemporaries to run for
public office.
"This is going to be a huge move-
ment in America," Pollock said.
"It's happening on a small scale
now, but it will happen on a large
scale eventually."
Pollock added that "it's not just a
movie, it's a movement in America."
to do it, but there's not money out
there. There has to be costs associ-
ated with membership and these
are nonprofit organizations."
Seiler added that living in a
sorority house can often be cheap-
er than paying for room and board
in the residence halls. She said the
average cost for room and board in
a Panhel sorority house is $7,344,
which includes 19 meals per week.
The average cost for room and
board for a double room in a resi-
dence hall, including the 150 block
meal plan, is $8,590, according to
University Housing's website.
"Room and board in a sorority is
generally lower than it is in a resi-
dence hall, and it's an eight-month
contract," Seiler said. "Living in a
sorority house is a bargain."
While Seiler said that students
who do not have the financial
means are at a disadvantage when
it comes to joining in Greek life,
tFC President Ari Parritz said the
cost of chapter dues is usually not
something that hinders students'
ability to join the Greek commu-
nity. The cost of dues for IFC chap-
ters are not released to the public.
"Any student, from any socio-
economic background, is equally
considered during recruitment,"
said. "We are fighting for integra-
tion, not separation."
Ben Kaminsky, president of
Israel IDEA, said Abu Toameh's
realism is necessary to resolve the
conflict.
"He seems to be a pragmatist,"
Kaminsky said. "If there ever is
going to be a solution to this con-
flict, pragmatists need to come
together to find solutions."

Besides creating "The Young-
est Candidate," Pollock is also
heavily involved in his non-profit,
non-partisan organization called
The Youngest Candidate, which is
based in Ann Arbor.
"We wanted to start a Rock
the Vote kind of thing where you
see other teenagers running for
office, and you can support local
campaigns and just get involved
in civics in some way," Pollock
said.
Pollock plans to use his film as a
way to draw attention to his non-
profit organization.
Pollock andhis teamhave devel-
oped a committee to encourage
youth candidates and political
activism at Michigan State Univer-
sity. The filmmaker said he plans to
start more committees - including
one at the University of Michigan
- as he travels across the country
for screenings of his film.
He said the film "is entertaining
and has rock music ... and is more
accessible to kids who would nor-
mally be turned off by something
political."
Parritz said in an e-mail interview.
"Most individual chapters, as well
as theirnational organizations,offer
extremely generous need-based
scholarships. As such, cost is most
often not a prohibitive measure in a
student's decision to go Greek."
Most IFC chapters have need-
based scholarships available spe-
cifically for the chapters' members
at the University, which are funded
by their alumni. The IFC does not
currently offer scholarships to
men in the Greek community, but
it does have plans to do so in the
future, Parritz said.
"Earlier this year my board dis-
cussed if the current state of the
economy would affect our win-
ter recruitment numbers," Par-
ritz said. "Not entirely sure what
would happen, we were obviously
ecstatic when we saw our numbers
soar this winter."
Some IFC chapters, includ-
ing Sigma Phi Epsilon, even offer
scholarships to students before
they arrive on campus, Seiler said.
"A couple of IFC fraternities, in
an effort to get interest in Greek
life and intheir fraternity will offer
scholarships to incoming students
and there's no obligation to join,"
Seiler said.
Robbie Dembo, vice chair of
AMI, said that Abu Toameh offers a
unique perspective on the conflict.
"I think that hearing an Arab
Israeli speak about the conflict
brings fresh perspective to campus
discourse," he said. "He has been a
correspondentcoveringthe conflict
in and outside Israel, so he brings a
lot of knowledge and insight into
the conflict."

ARIES
(March 21to April 19)
Quite likely, you'll feel unusually
close toa friend today. If someone needs
your help, you'll really identify with
where he or she is coming from.
TAURUS
(April 20to May 20)
Others might not understand you
today. They might put you on a pedestal
and idolize what you represent; or by
contrast, they might think you're full of
pie-in-the-sky dreams. Hard to say
which way this goes.
GEMINI
(May 21 to June 20)
All kinds of interesting philosophies
and unusual ideas attract your attention
today. You're intrigued by paranormal
phenomena or news about magical
events. You want to know more!
CANCER
(June 21to July 22)
If you can do fundraising for others
who are needy, you will do so. You want
to use what you share with someone to
help someone else who is less fortunate.
LEO
(July 23 to Aug. 22)
Your idealism is aroused today. You
feel very sympathetic and kind toward
close friends and partners. If there's any-
thing you can do to help someone today,
you will.
VIRGO
(Aug. 23 to Sept. 22)
You might want to help a co-worker
today. Alternatively, co-workers might
want to help you. Either way, a strong
feeling of give-and-take and mutual car-
ing exists on the job today.
LIBRA
(Sept. 23 to Oct. 22)
Your sympathies go out to children in
need today. Artists can be particularly

creative today. Romance is idealistic to
the extreme.
SCORPIO
(Oct. 23 to Nov. 21)
You will do whatever you can to help
a family member today. Quite possibly,
others will do what they can to help you.
People feel extremely kind and sympa-
thetic to each other today.
SAGITTARIUS
(Nov. 22 to Dec. 21)
Don't be worried if you spend today
daydreaming or passing time in a
dreamy way. We all need to have days
like this now and then to give ourselves
a mental-health day.
CAPRICORN
(Dec. 22 to Jan. 19)
You might be tempted to go overboard
spending money on luxurious and
extravagant things today. (It might be
wise to give these matters a sober, sec-
ond thought.)
AQUARIUS
(Jan. 20to Feb. 18)
You feel kindly disposed to others
today. You're in a sympathetic frame of
mind. This is good.
PISCES
(Feb. 19to March 20)
It's easy to be selfless and put the
needs of others before your own today.
You truly care for those who are less for-
tunate. You have genuine concern for the
suffering of others.
YOU BORN TODAY You have excel-
lent mediating skills because you're
quick to see where each person is com-
log from. You understand the human
psyche. Not only that, you have a talent
for seeing all sides of a situation; plus
you're persuasive when you want to be.
Give yourself an opportunity to study or
learn something important this year.

Sims' S eroics not enough

By JASON KOHLER
Daily Sports Writer
With less than five minutes left
in last night's game, sophomore for-
ward Manny Harris put the ball in
his left hand, drove down the base-
line and dished it to junior forward
Zack Gibson. Gibson dunked the
ball and was fouled on the play.
Gibson M A
nailed the MICHIGAN STATE 54
free throw MICHIGAN 42
and the
atmosphere at Crisler Arena hit a
crescendo.
Despite all that had gone wrong,
Michigan was down by just four
points against No. 9 Michigan State
in the final minutes.
But Michigan wouldn't get any
closer and the Spartans pulled away
to win 54-42 in the only regular-
season matchup between the two
rivals. Junior forward DeShawn
Sims led Michigan with 18 points,
but he was the only Michigan player
to score in double digits.
The Wolverines had their chance
in the waning moments, but as Sims
said after the game, they were out-
hustled on many occasions.
With about three minutes left
and Michigan down by five, Harris
intercepted a pass and had just one
defender to beat on the breakaway.
As he went up to the hoop, Harris
lost control of the ball and it sailed
out ofbounds.
A minute later with the Wolver-
ines down by five, Harris grabbed a
loose ball, but Michigan State center
Goran Suton muscled it away.
"There were some 50-50 balls
thatwehavetoget," Michigan coach
John Beilein said. "It's part of a will-
ingness to bloody your nose to win,
these are the ones we got to get."
Michigan fought an uphill battle
all game and struggled to score
against Michigan State's tough 2-3
zone defense. The Wolverines' 42
points were a season low.
Michigan (5-7 Big Ten, 15-10
overall) mustered just 15 points in
the first half. The only consolation
for the Wolverines was that Michi-
gan State managed just 23.
"That hasn't happened to us
much," Beilein said. "Our timing's
off and their defense was very good
as a shock early in the game. ... We
don't really see that length and that
speed defensively when we're shoot-
ing the ball or movingthe ball."

t's finally time for the
No. 4 Michigan hockey team
to start thinking about the
playoffs.
And considering where the
Wolverines were earlier in the
season, it must CHRIS
be a relief to MESZAROS
be in that posi-
tion. On Ice Hockey
But they
still have a lot of work left to do.
Michigan is currently in third
place in the CCHA with 30
points, two behind second-place
Miami (Ohio) and six behind con-
ference-leading Notre Dame.
Ohio State and Alaska are
Michigan's biggest concerns,
with each sitting just two points
behind and tied for fourth place.
Nebraska-Omaha, the Wolver-
ines' opponent this weekend, is
within range with 26 points in
sixth.
But enough about the stand-
ings. What does Michigan have
to do?
The top eight CCHA teams
host a playoff series, and the top
four teams get a bye and host a
second-round series.
All Michigan needs is one
point - a tie - to clinch a home
series and six points to secure a
first-round bye.
"From here on out, it's playoff
hockey, every game, every period,
every shift," junior acting captain
Chris Summers said.
That puts the Wolverines in
a pretty good spot, given where
they were around Thanksgiv-
ing. At that point, Michigan was
buried in the CCHA standings in
seventh place and had won just
one of five conference series.
After that, the team awakened,
reeling off 12 wins in 14 games.
With a real shot to finish second
in the conference, the Wolverines
realize they couldn't have done
much better.
"We're starting to establish
our identity, who we are as a
team," Summers said. "We were
kind of questionable at the begin-
ning of the year and had kind of a
shaky start. But I think guys are
starting to adjust to their roles on

the team."
However, it's nearly impossible
for Michigan to win the CCHA
title outright, since the Fighting
Irish have a six-point lead and
play some of the weaker confer-
ence teams down the stretch.
Last year, four CCHA teams
made NCAA Tournament. It's
likely the conference will again
receive four berths this year at
most, making a top-four finish
in the regular-season CCHA
standings and anappearance in
at least the'conference tourna-
ment semifinals that much more
important.
The other concern for the Wol-
verines is their inconsistency.
"I still think we should be able
to win every game at home, and
we haven't done that," sophomore
Louie Caporusso said. "When you
play in an arena like Yost, there
shouldn't be any reason why you
can't run over every team."
Their recent winning streak
is impressive, but the power play
continues to struggle, the defense
gives up too many turnovers and
the offense can be spotty.
Until a few weeks ago, Michi-
gan's top line produced more
than haFf the team's offense,
though the team has been much
more balanced of late. The all-
sophomore line of Carl Hagelin,-
Aaron Palushaj and Matt Rust
scored three goals against Lake
Superior State, and the rest of the
Wolverines are also starting to
pick up their scoring.
"We're not relying on one line,"
Berenson said. "We're not rely-
ing on one player. We'll probably
have one 20-goal scorer this year.
I think we're a more balanced
team."
While the Wolverines cer-
tainly have their flaws, that can
be overcome in college hockey.
Who would have thought Notre
Dame would be in the National
Championship game last season,
or Michigan State would win it
all the year before?
All it takes is for a team to get
on a roll at the end of the season
and there's no reason why Michi-
gan isn't capable of that.

second half, it seemed like the scor-
ing struggles would continue.
The Spartans outscored Michi-
gan 7-4 in the first five minutes dff
the half. But with 14:10 left in the
half, freshman guard Zack Novak
received the ball on the right wing
and knocked down his only 3-point-
er of the night.
On three ensuing possessions,
Novak fed Sims for three dunks.
Novak had three assists, all of them
going to Sims.
Sims was the Wolverines' only
viable scoring threat, with all of his
coming in the paint.
To make things worse, sharp-
shooters Novak and freshman guard

Stu Douglass finished a 'combined
1-for-8 from the field. The team
wasn't much better, hitting just 34.8
percent of its shots.
"Give them credit, they were
ready for us," fifth-year senior C.J.
Lee said. "That's just on guys taking
their shots with confidence. I don't
thinkguys were scared. I don'tthink
guys were hesitant. I just think guys
missed. We're not going to change
nothing. Coach has been doing this
forever, and we're notthe first group
to play this offense."
Michigan hoped to use this
game against rival Michigan State
(10-2, 20-4) to bolster its tourna-
ment resume. But now the Wolver-

ines will have to scramble to pick
up some quality conference wins
before Selection Sunday.
Beilein wouldn't say last night's
game was a must-win, just an impor-
tant one.
"We just have to play," Beilein
said. "We just got to concentrate on
the next practice, next game. What
is the must for? Is it to get into the
NCAA Tournament? When it comes
to March and we're not close to 20
wins or we're not 9-9 in the league
or something like that, then we
won't be in it.
"But does one game determine it?
I don't think so, but they certainly
all add up."

More Wolverines need to speak up

uring last Sunday's film
session, Michigan men's
basketball coach John Bei-
lein told his team a fable while pre-
paring for No. 9 Michigan State.
The story goes like this: A group of
elephants stood
in a jungle amid
fewer lions.
The lions didn't
think they stood
a chance against
the more numer-
ous and mighty
elephants, but
the lions even- RUTH
tually came to LINCOLN
see the situation
differently.
They noticed the elephants never
talked to each other, so when the
elephants separated, the lions could
attack and pick them off one-by-
one.
Beilein hoped the tale would
motivate some of his quieter play-
ers to speak up on the court. In last
night's 54-42 loss at Crisler Arena,
the rivalry crowd was deafening
at times, but a startling silence fell

upon the Wolverines.
"Basically, we have to talk on
defense and talk on offense when
we're open, or we'll get eaten," said
fifth-year senior guard David Mer-
ritt, explainingBeilein's tale.
The first part of the message got
through pretty well. The Wolverines
held the Spartans, who lead the Big
Ten in offense, to a season-low 54
points. Michigan State also tied its
season-low rebound total with 31.
But something else was missing.
Besides fifth-year senior guard
C.J. Lee, the Wolverines are a quiet
group on the floor. Lee consistently
audibly encourages his team to get
back on defense and calms players
after they commit fouls.
Last night, while playing a career-
high 37 minutes, Lee said a sore
throat limited him vocally.
But the Wolverines need more
than one major voice on the court.
Who was there to fill in?
Beilein has said junior forward
DeShawn Sims and sophomore for-
ward Manny Harris have grown the
most as team leaders this season.
Last night, Harris spoke up on

defense, switching defenders in the
man-to-man schemes and chasing
for rebounds. Harris's contributions
were vital for Michigan'to stay in
the game.
But on the other end, Michi-
gan State's defense was a little too
much.
Michigan was held to a season-low
15 points on19 shots before halftime.
Five times that half, the Wolverines
were forced to take bad shots as the
shot clock wound down.
And in a low-scoring rivalry
game like this one, someone needed
to step up.
Sims responded in the second
half, calling for the ball inside and
finishingwith agame-high 18 points.
Sims didn't start the game, but still
set the tempo after the break.
"Walking the walk before I can
talk the talk," Sims said, describing
the biggest obstacle to opening up
on the court. "Got to walk it. Got
to be able to do everything I ask of
someone else. If I tell someone not
to miss a screen or talk on screens,
I have to talk on screens they see
every time."

This team is hard to figure out.
Sometimes, it's hitting eight or nine
3-pointers a night, and other times,
the ball doesn't even come near the
hoop. Butmore voices canhelp when
things aren't going well to spark the
offense and defense.
With just six games left, and just
two of those at home, Lee can't carry
the whole burden. Michigan needs
its best players like Harris and Sims
to say more on the floor-
"I always say you may have a very
quiet persona, but you can not have
that on the basketball court," Beil-
ein said at his weekly radio show on
Feb. 9. "And until we all understand
that and come out of our personality
a little bit, it holds us back. It really
does. It doesn't mean they're bad
people, but it's very important."
Michigan is a young team and its
players will find their voices with
time. But until that happens, the
Wolverines' NCAA Tournament
hopes are fading just as quickly as
their voices.

Golfers shake off rust
in Puerto Rico tourney

,

shaping the unions for you

By ROGER SAUERHAFT
Daily Sports Writer
For the Michigan women's golf
team, a three-day trip to Puerto
Rico was probably the perfect
change of scenery.
But for senior co-captain Lydia
Benitez Colln, the Lady Puerto
Rico Classic was her final chance
as a Wolverine to hit the links at
the Coco Beach Resort course, an
hour away from where she lives.
However, the Puerto Rican
native wasn't able to shake off
a winter's worth of rust during
Michigan's first tournament of
the year, firing a 241 (plus-25) in
the 54-hole tournament Saturday
through yesterday.
The rest of the Wolverines
didn't fare much better, shooting
a composite score of 933 and fin-
ishing 11th out of16 teams. Purdue
won the tournament easily (888).
Although Michigan faced some
tough odds - six of the top 10 in
attendance teams play in warm
climates and most already had
played this season - Michigan
coach Kathy Teichert said it was a
frustrating weekend.
Additionally, Kent State, the
only team that Teichert said
hadn't played yet this year, has
three international players on its
roster that she said played over
Winter Break.
"We're still working out the
kinks, it's going to take some

time," Teichert said. "I can't be
discouraged with this group. They
do work hard, and it's just time to
refocus."
Teichertsaid a major factor that
kept her team from finishing bet-
ter in the tournament was poor
performance on short approach
shots. Aside from a weekend in
Florida before the start of the
semester, Michigan players hadn't
actually played on a course since
mid-November.
The team has been practicing
indoors and at Miles of Golf prac-
tice facility in nearby Ypsilanti
throughout the offseason, but the
coach said nothing is the same as
real grass and actual competition.
"As atteam, we need to do a bet-
ter job with our scoring irons,"
Teichert said. "They weren't crisp
this weekend. We're not getting
the ball close enough to the hole
and we're even missing some
greens."
. Colon was no exception, strug-
gling all weekend with her short-
irons, according to Teichert.
"She missed a lot of shots,"
Teichert said. "But she's going to
bounce back. She's very feisty and
wants to compete at the highest
level."
Freshman Milena Savich was
the only Wolverine to finish in the
top-20, carding a 229 (plus-13) in
the tournament. Her performance
was good enough to tie for 18th
place.

My mark of destiny

o one asks to be different.
It's just something that hap-
pens, something that you
sort of get stuck with. Some choose
to accept their circumstances, and
others try to change them. I have
learned to accept the fact that I'm
different, but I still can't help but
wonder how different things would
be if I never walked into the kitchen
of my old home years ago.
The incident happened when I
was four years old, living in Port-au-
Prince, Haiti and left unsupervised.
My mother had hired a babysitter
for the day, but the girl was young
and not too careful. With a single
parent's income, my mother could
only get what help she could afford,
which wasn't much. That morning, I
started off in the care of a stranger,
and by nightfall, I was on my own.
Unaccompanied in my house, I wan-
dered aimlessly from room to room
until I found myself in the kitchen.
In Haiti, it's custom to prepare
dinner in the morning and leave it
stewing on the stove for the rest of
the day. The smells that wafted into
my nostrils all day were intoxicat-
ing, and even now, I still remember
them. That day, desperate to cure my
hunger pains, I found myself drawn
to those smells even more. Standing
on the balls of my feet, I stretched

compact and lock their dumpsters.
So, of all places, don't start there.
Although this adventure
focused on food, freeganism
applies to anything that's free. Cat
has also dived behind thrift stores
and recommends freecycle.org,
where she once procured a wash-
ing machine.
That's the story of the intrigue
behind a simple recycled 'rose.
Now that I know the economic,
environmental, and community
benefits of freeganism, I under-
stand why someone would fall
head over heels for a few bouquets
of dumpster flowers. What can I
say? My rose, in a measuring cup
of water on my desk, is now even
redder and more radiant than
when I first received it.

the tips of my fingers across warm
smooth metal.
The moment I yanked, my head
was engulfed in extreme heat. Clos-
ing my eyes and covering my face
with my hand, I felt the boiling slime
penetrate my hands and cover my
back. I stood there screaming while
the oil burned my skin. There was
no longer the aroma of spiced chick-
en and buttered rice, but instead, the
smell of burnt hair and flesh filled
the room. That's when I realized I
was burning. My hair, my scalp, my
back = all of me was burning.
After the skin grafts, after I left
the hospital and after I was "fixed,"
I returned home and looked in the
mirror. I no longer saw a happy lit-
tle girl with sparkling brown eyes.
Instead, I saw half a little girl and
half of something scary - half a
head of hair, half a face and half a
person. Although the hospital had
done what they could, the medical
care in Haiti at that time wasn't up
to par. My mom tried to bring up
my morale, but I wasn't her happy
little girl anymore. She decided that
I needed to go to the United States
so that I could have a proper opera-
tion.

person. If I had never been burned,
never been adopted and never lived

positionI am today. I would most
likely never have graduated high
school, let alone gotten to attend the
University of Michigan.
My scar is a keepsake of how I
left Haiti, of all the people that have
helped me and of all I have had to
overcome to be the person I am
today. What I see in the mirror now
is just a souvenir, a one-of-a-kind
and indestructible memory.

Business School senior Jack
Dart studied Chinese for two
semesters last year because of the
China theme semester and the Bei-
jing Olympics.
He said that the attitude of most
non-Asian students taking the
language is to better understand
China for business relations.
"They hear it's going to become a
superpower," he said. "They're try-
ing to get a leg up in terms of going
into International Relations."
The Ross School of Business
offers a study abroad program to
China, which fills up quickly each
year. It also hosts an Asia Business
Conference each year, with panel-
ists who work with companies in
Asia.
Business school junior Sarah
Horvitz said a lot' of students in
the business school are looking to
work abroad because the economy
here is not at its most stable.
"The economy isojust blowing up
over there," she said.

CMENAS in the sense that all of a
sudden itcreated anenormous pub-
lic awareness that the Mid East is a
crucial region, and there's an enor-
mous need for expertise both in the
public and political reason," Hagen
said. "Since then, for instance, fed-
eral support for the area studies
and especially language studies,
more particular for Arabic, has not
been questioned anymore."
The center was first interested in
the area stretching from Morocco
to Iran and Iraq, McCarus said. But
as areas like Pakistan became more
newsworthy the Center expanded
its area of study.
"Usually when there's a crisis
in some part of the world, those
languages increase," McCarus
said. "For example, when the U.S.
opened diplomatic relations with
China, there was a lot of Ping
'Pong."
GROWING DEBT TO CHINA
In light of China's rise to eco-

nomic prominence, the Center
for Chinese Studies has seen an
increase in student and campus
interest. Unlike some of its fel-
low area studies centers, CCS only
offers graduate degrees, leaving
the undergraduate education up to
the Asian Languages and Cultures
department.
Political Science Prof. Mary
Gallagher, Director of the Cen-
ter for Chinese Studies, said the
Center is in charge of much of the
campus outreach on China such
as weekly documentary film view-
ings, lecturer talks on campus and
support to other departments that
choose to offer classes pertaining
to China.
Gallagher said Chinese has
become more relevant as Chi-
na's economic importance has
increased.
"It used to be you went into the
Foreign Service," she said. "Nowa-
days, there are plenty of places who
will hireyou."

DON'T SMOKE DOWN PHELPS
Eight people connected to the infamous Michael Phelps bong hit photo-

graphed at a University of South Carolina party have been arrested. One
of the culprits is the alleged owner of the bong who caught the attention
of police when he tried to sell his Olympian-patronized piece on eBay
for $100,000. A dumb move, to be sure, but there are many students on
campus who must understand the need to recover something after an
encounter with Phelps in party mode. Let me guess: he smoked all your
weed, grabbed your girlfriend's butt, mumbled something unintelligible
and tried to hit your best friend. Yep, that's our Phelps.
STIMULATING PACKAGES
The Senate approved Barack Obama and Timothy Geithner's miracle
stimulus package Tuesday, and somehow, the nation's economy isn't fixed
yet. Infact, the initial response on Wall Street was anything but encourag-
ing. The Dow fell by 382 points by the time the market closed. Investors
are concerned that Geithner's plan to flood the financial system with as
much as $2.5 trillion lacks details. But the Obama team hasn't been trying
their hardest to assure us that the plan is surefire and even... sexy? At
least that's what the language of some-Obama staffers suggest. As Peter
Orszag, Obama's budget director, said last week: "This is a package that
is responsive to this massive gap." Hm, not sexy. Not assuring.

of language and culture studies.
The opportunities available today
in many foreign language programs
stem directly from the "know the
enemy" mentality of yesterday.
Whenever a threat from abroad
captured the attention of the nation
- Pearl Harbor, the Space Race,
the Sept. 11 attacks and the United
States' growing economic debt to
China - area studies programs at
the University benefited in fed-
eral funding and increased student
interest. There was a need to under-
stand the enemy and to have schol-
ars trained about the history and
culture of the area so the govern-
ment would have a pool of experts
to call upon.
"Anything that winds up on
the front page of the newspapers
receives attention," said Douglas
Northrop, director of the Center for
Russian and East European Studies.
"(Russian)wouldn'thave received
the same attention if it didn't have
political meaning"
In the last century, this trend has
resulted in increased federal funds
and student interest for the Center
of Japanese Studies, the Center for
Russian and East European Stud-
ies and the Center for Middle East-
ern and North African Studies.
These programs qualify as National
Resource Centers, which are eligible
to receive federal funding under the

pean Studies.
According to a report
released in 1991, the area
studies centers at the
University were created
because interested fac-

ulty members persuaded the Uni-
versity to ask for funding.
In the late 1950s and early 1960s
- after the launch of Sputnik -
NDEA funding for Area Studies
shot up from about $23,000,000 to
about $93,000,000.
Without Sputnik and the Cold
War, though, that funding wouldn't
have begun on such a large scale.
During the Cold War, no one
really knew what to believe about
the Soviet Union. And as soon as
Sputnik was launched, there was a
fear that it would surpass the U.S.
in technology and weaponry. At the
same time, there were still those
sympathetic with the communist
theory, despite the Red Scare and
McCarthyism.
Northrop said students studying
Russia and the surrounding areas
tended to be either sympathetic
or condemning of the communist
plight.
"Politics in the field tended to be
very polarized," he said. "Efforts to
stigmatize people on one side or the
other certainly did take place."

COMEBACK CANINE
Stump the Sussex spaniel won the 133rd Annual Westminster Kennel
Club show Tuesday at the ripe old agerof 10 - that's like 70 in dogyears.
Stump, who's officially named Ch. Clussexx Three D Grinchy Glee, made a
9 major comeback after falling seriously ill in 2005. While unlikely to rouse
any more interest in dog shows in general society, Stump's win might
attract the attention of the science community. Is this Sussex spaniel's
medical history an example of extreme inbreeding gone right?

ABOUT CAMPUS

LLUSTRAT ONS BY JOHN 00U ST

We exchanged a some-
what lengthy kiss ... it was,
again, a romantic kiss."
- BEAU BREEDLOVE, a 19-year-old former
mayoral intern from Portland, Ore., describing
one of his underage sexual encounters with
Sam Adams, the city's publicly gay mayor, in
a men's bathroom at City Hall. Adams has
admitted the affair but said they waited to
have sex until Breedlove turned 18.

"The Khomeini fatwah was
pronounced on Valentine's
Day, 20 years ago, so that
would be the worst."
- SALMAN RUSHDIE when asked by a New York
Magazine reporter if he had any bad Valentine's
stories. Rushdie went into hiding for nearly a
decade after the Ayatollah of Iran issued a fatwa
ordering his assassination in response to
his novel "The Satanic Verses".




Rent-by-the-hour
romance
Testing the waters at the
Oasis Hot Tub Gardens
I've always been a little suspi-
cious of the Oasis Hot Tub Gardens
on State Street. And to be sure, I'm
not alone.
"I used to work at a pool, and
you can only get things so clean,"
my roommate.said when I told her
of my plan to visit the Oasis.
For many, including myself, the
idea of a rent-by-the-hour hot tub
room is questionable. It has a cer-
tain Las Vegas quality: what hap-
pens in the hot tub stays in the hot
tub - perhaps at the expense of
the next person to use the hot tub.
But admittedly, my qualms
about the Oasis aren't founded
on anything concrete. What do I
know about the world of rental jets
and rainforest rooms? I've never
been squeamish of hotel mattress-
es or bowling shoes - is a well-
used Jacuzzi any different? To find
out, I put my prejudices to the test
and went with my boyfriend for a
romantic night at the Oasis.
I checked online first to fig-
ure out the best time to go. For
two people, the cheapest rate -
$29 per hour - is offered before
4 p.m. An evening hour goes for
$36 Sunday through Thursday
and $44 on weekend nights.
On the website, I scoped out all
16 of the theme rooms available:
"Japan" with its oriental pago-
da, "Vancouver" complete with
totem pole and rustic fireplace
and "Bali" featuring a painted
seascape mural.
One tab over from "garden
photos" is another labeled "water
purity," which attests in detail to
the cleanliness of the Oasis hot
tubs. But it wasn't exactly assur-
ing tobe so assured. Would a res-
taurant advertise that its kitchen
is sanitary? Or a hotel that the
sheets are washed?
Of course, those paragraphs
describing the "state-of-the-art

disinfectant and filtration sys-
tems" are exactly for the benefit of
skeptics like myself. And actually,
the water at Oasis does go through
much more than the Band-Aid-
ridden public pools of youth must
have. The water in each hot tub is
completely filtered out every eight
minutes and each tub is drained
and hand scrubbed almost daily,
Oasis manager Faith Frazine said.
"We know if people are con-
cerned about the cleanliness of
their waters, then they probably
won't be repeat customers," Fra-
zine said.
Before I talked with Frazine
and had my cleanliness concerns
entirely put to rest, I gathered my
own impression of the Oasis. I'm
happy to report that the gardens
did not seem the least bit unhy-
gienic, though it was still quite an
experience.
Oasis stays open until at least 1
a.m. every night, so my boyfriend
and I chose to try our luck with a
walk-in appointment last Sunday
at 11 p.m. After parking our car,
we passed another, grad-student
type couple who must have just

emerged from their own love tub.
The woman - her short hair still
dripping wet - seemed to shoot
me a knowing smile.
Entering the building, we were
immediately greeted by the strong
smell of chlorine and aromatic spa
packets, as well as two smiling
women in bright floral shirts.
The employee who checked us
in acquainted us with the rules -
no food, no bubble bath or oils and,
first and foremost, no alcohol.
That last one, which was posted
on several walls, caught my atten-
tion. Was it to keep customers
from profaning the gardens with
drunken debauchery? Were the
owners of Oasis enterprising pro-
hibitionists? No. As it turns out,
it's because alcohol raises body
temperature, and for a company
that deals in 100-degree water,
the liability of a customer putting
a few back and passing out face
down in the Casablanca tub is too
high.
"One beer is like 15 beers," Fra-
zine said. "It's not safe."
After declining to purchase a
bottle of St. Julien non-alcoholic

wine, my boyfriend and I were
led to the Borneo Rainforest room
- an open-ceiling space with the
gardens' largest hot tub, capable of
holding up to 10 people.
The woman guiding us men-
tioned that the room was often
used for children's birthday par-
ties, but the thought struck me
that it might be the setting of very
different, very adult kind of par-
ties.
But I pushed this thought from
my mind. The soft music flowing
from the changing room radio (set
to the "piano and guitar" station)
didn't suggest "porno" so much as
"Mom and Dad's special date".
Through a door we found our
private paradise, which consisted
of a large hot tub, a plastic palm
tree and a stone waterfall that had
been temporarily put out of com-
mission during the last few weeks
of extreme cold.
The space didn't really exude
Borneo - in the rainforest, I know,
waterfalls don't freeze over - but
with the rising steam lit by the
glow of alternating neon lights, it
was sort of like a dream sequence

in some Univision soap opera.
It was sexy in its way, not that
I'd recommend having sex. Being
mutually averse to pay-by-the-
hour sex locations, my boyfriend
and I didn't try. But if we had
wanted to get the most bang for
our buck, it might have been dif-
ficult. The eye-watering chemical
vapors and high water tempera-
ture discourage rapid movement.
Most visitors to the Borneo
room likely do what we did: stare
at the moon and enjoy the contrast
between the chilly air and steam-
ing water. Frazine said that Oasis
is busiest in the winter for just that
reason. She also said customers
corpe in droves to use the outdoor
tubs when it's raining, and that
they're even safe during a thun-
derstorm - a prospect that might
entice me to come back.
So in the end, I believe I've over-
come any reservations I had about
the Oasis Hot Tub Gardens. The
25-year-old company is what is
has always been: a sort of classy,
sort of cheesy escape just a few
miles from campus.

VIDEO OF
THE WEEK
Clammy Sosa is mad
For years, mascots have merely ran
around stadiums, flailing their arms
and attempting to pump up crowds.
They're no more than glorified cheer-
leaders with funny costumes.
Buts watchtout, sports fans, The
mascots arc taking the games into
their own hands.
Across the nation, innocent coach-
es and players have been accosted by
a group of seemingly friendly mas-
cots called the ZOOperstars.
The most dangerous of these -
Clammy Sosa - is an 8-foot-6 clam
dressed to resemble baseball slugger
Sammy Sosa. And Clammy has an
appetite for destruction.
According to the official Clammy
Sosa website, he "slurps up and swal-
lows everything in sight." The giant
clam backs up, sprints toward its
prey, pounces and swallows the per-
son whole.
This video captures Clammy at his
most lethal. After playing catch with
a baseball player, the mascot backs up
and attacks the unsuspecting man.
After a few awskward moments, the
player's head disappears and his legs
are flailing from Clammy's mouth.
The playeris thencompletelyswal-
lowed by the gianteclam. Disliking the
taste of sweaty clothes, the mascot
spits out the player's shoes and uni-
form. He then trots off the field, his
job done and the crowd stunned.

STUDY OF THE WEEK
Men who read Maxim struggle with body image
Men who look at sexy female models in provocative magazines like
Maxim experience more body-image problems than those who don't,
according to a study published in the journal Human Communication
Research by researchers at the University of Missouri - Columbia.
For the study, the researchers conducted three different experiments
with male undergraduate students. In the first, they asked 77 students
questions about body self-consciousness before and after they started
reading the magazines Maxim, FHM and Stuff. In the second experi-
ment, the researchers had some students examine layouts of female
models while others looked at pictures of fit males. Last, the researchers
divided men into two groups: one looked at female models, while the
other looked at pictures of their "average-looking" boyfriends.
In all three experiments, the researchers concluded that men who
looked at the magazineswere more self-conscious about their fitness and
body image, saying they didn't have a chance with the female models.

magine coming home to a dozen bouquets of
flowers. They are so numerous that it was nec-
essary to use cups, tomato sauce jars and beer
bottles as makeshift vases. Then your lover tells you
a dirty secret - these flowers are, in fact, dumpster
flowers. And you fall even more in love.
These are the life and times - and treasures - of
a freegan.
The title of "queen diver" would seem to belong
to some pool high-dive champion. But in the case of
one campus co-op house, the title refers to Cat, the
house's top dumpster diver. I spoke with Cat in her
kitchen while she prepared dinner for her house-
mates. Well-stocked with grains and produce, the
kitchen centered around a wooden table where her
housemates arranged bouquets of flowers from the
previous night's diving trip. Cat and her housemates
asked that their full names and the name of their
co-op not be used in this article since dumpster div-
ing is illegal.
Regular diving trips are the main source of the
co-opers' freegan lifestyle. Freeganism, a play off of
veganism, is an anti-consumerist philosophy where
practitioners seek to minimize the use of resources
by limiting their reliance on commercial markets.
When it comes to food, this means a diet based largely
on homegrown produce and dumpster loot.
"Our culture is one that wastes a lot of things ... so
we've made a commitment to reduce our consump-
tion that benefits us and our community," Cat said.
At heart, freeganism is about environmentalism
above specific political or economic views. The defin-
ing rule of freeganism is to reduce one's consumption,
especially through diet. As Cat explains it, there are
too many problems with the current agricultural sys-
tem for her to endorse it with her money. Transporta-
tion and packaging adds greatly to the use of energy
and fossil fuels, while packaging contributes equally
to the size of our landfills. On top of that, traditional
farming practices deplete soil of its natural resources
by overplanting, and the lost minerals are replaced by
ecologically damaging petrochemical fertilizers.
It's true that there is a strong economic argument
against freeganism. Grocery shopping helps to sus-
tain the faltering economy, and some studies have
shown that the positive effects of other consumption
philosophies like "eating local" are uncertain. But it's
also true that all around Ann Arbor, items like gour-
met cheese and two-day-old sourdough bread is still
good to be eaten but won't be unless someone claims
it from a dumpster.
Many freegans, including Cat, are also practicing
vegans.Althoughshesaidsheisn'tagainsteatingmeat,
she doesn't agree with the conventional practices of
raising and slaughtering meat and the overconsump-
tion of meat in the U.S. Conventionally, animals like
cows are raised on grains in confined spaces. Vegans
and vegetarians often have qualms with this because
the practice uses excessive amounts of energy in the
production of grain and raises questions about ani-
mal health and rights and food safety.
When they have to buy food, freegans choose3 to
buy from local sources that preserve the soil, reduce
transportation and promote healthy animal-rearing
practices. But even if food has been shipped across
the country, they feel it's economically and environ-
mentally all right to dive for it after it has been dis-
carded.

If attending an event with free food, most freegans
won't accept a meal unless they know it's been con-
scientiously grown or produced. If they visita friend
who's prepared a meal from Meijer, though, freegans
are likely to indulge.
As our conversation came to aclose, Cat invited me
on my first diving trip: "I'll give you some gloves and
a head lamp and you can jump in with me." The date
was set for the following evening.
Before I left after the interview, a housemate
handed me avelvet red rose plucked fromthe house's
dumpster garden. Instead of the rose's usual roman-
tic suggestion, it was clear this flower expressed a
love for the environment. I walked home in high spir-
its, imagining what kind of souvenir I would find on
my trip.
Around midnight last Sunday, Cat and I recovered
several plastic milk crates from the snow in front of
the co-op and piled into her car with two other divers.
When we arrived at a local supermarket, we noticed
another car. "We've got competition," a housemate
noted.
While waiting for the store's employees to filter.
out, Cat explained diving etiquette. Since diving is
illegal and divers don't want to contact the police in
case of a dispute, they've developed their own deco-
rum to deal with other divers.
As the other car had been waiting longer, they had
first diving dibs. This means that they willbe allowed
to jump in first and will have first dibs over the spoils.
Still, as per freegan law, there is usuallyequal sharing
among the divers.
Secondly, neither car would drive near the dump-
ster until all employees had cleared out. If either
pounced while employees were still clearing out the
store, they would surely be kicked out. But it was also
a matter of respect, Cat explained. Although some
employees may have suspected why the two cars were
there, they had no intention of creating trouble for the
divers unless the looting occurred right in their pres-
ence. Finally, divers must always return the dump-
ster to the condition in which they found it, leaving
no mess or sign of disturbance for the storeowners to
deal with the next day.
After the last car exited and the other divers
jumped in, we made our move. Usingthe hole created
for the dumpster truck's forklift, Cat vaulted herself
into a wonderland of excess. Slowly, bags were lifted
through the hole and passed to those of us waiting
below.
That Cat submerged herself in a dumpster isn't
as filthy as it would seem. The trash bags she rifled
through were filled solely with packaged food items
that had just been picked off the shelves. Packaged
potatoes, netted citrus fruits and paper-wrapped
breads each filled their owngarbage bags. There were
bags of apples, oranges, limes, lettuce, plastic-boxed
strawberries, red currants, cookies and egg cartons
tainted only by some ice cream that had spilled.
Then, two entire garbage bags were devoted to
day-old bread. Another two or three bags to apples
and oranges and two bags to baby red potatoes that
were so heavy I nearly collapsed under the weight.
In one last bag were eight shrink-wrapped blocks of
expensive blue, cheddar and French Raclette cheeses.
The problem with these cheeses wasn't age - it was
only a slight misshapenness that made them unsuit-
able for the grocery's display.

Finally, it was my turn. I donned my headlight and
rubber gloves and took the forklift step into the gro-
cery abyss. I immediately noticed that it wasn't the
eggshell and coffee-grounds-littered receptacle I
imagined. It could almost, bizarrely, be described as
clean. It still stood its ground as a dumpster, though,
as a grimy bottom layer and accompanying odor
became more apparent with the opening and empty-
ing of subsequent bags. After a few minutes of sift-
ing, I decided my efforts would be better put towards
sorting and exited the dumpster.
Rumor has it that diving virgins will find either
chocolate or wine on their first trip. While this first-
timer didn't leave with either aphrodisiac, the four
trash bags full of flowers were a fine substitute. Each
bag contained roughly a dozen plastic-wrapped bou-
quets, which Cat and her housemates plan to distrib-
ute to other co-ops for Valentine's Day.
Since Cat is a strict vegan, she did not pick up the
few packages of Italian sausages that appeared in
some trash bags. She did, however, pick out the eggs
and blocks of cheese for her non-vegan roommates
who might have otherwise contributed to the mass
consumption of these products. .
This illustrates the major difference between veg-
ans and freegans: while neither group will pay for
meat, freegans will consume it if it's been saved from
a dumpster. "If it's going into the dumpster, I will
happily take some meat," said Cat's vegan housemate
Dani. On the other hand, a third roommate, Bran-
don, said that "dumpster meat would be a line that I
wouldn't cross." Either way, all housemates are care-
ful only to take animal products in the winter when
the cold weather will prevent the meat from going
bad.
Although some produce looked past its expiration
date, the vast majority of it lacked significant signs of
decay. According to Cat, there were a few reasons for
this - when supermarkets are overstocked or have a
new shipment of food, the excess is bagged and sent
to the dumpster. Brandon added that in the case of

packaged stock, if a jar of peanut butter leaks over
eleven other jars, the entire case is thrown out. Other
products had only just passed their sell-by date but
hadn't yet shown signs of rotting.
In addition to rules of etiquette, the co-op also has
fairly rigid sanitary practices. No loose or open items
like stray bananas or opened boxes of crackers are
brought back to the co-op and everything is sorted for
decay before being stored in the kitchen. The "when
in doubt, throw it out" rule always applies.
Cat needs to uphold these practices to meet her
own safety standards and those of her few room-
mates who are finicky about dumpster food. Because
of these practices, she has helped supply the co-op
with one-third to one-fourth of its weekly food sup-
ply and has never had a case of food poisoning.
The diving queen reasoned that one of the larg-
est deterrents for others is the natural association
of trash with contamination. But she has been able
to turn skeptics onto dumpster meals because of the
quality of food retrieved and the layers of protective
plastic wrapping.
As we left the grocery store with a trunk filled to
the brim, I was content that the company's trash had
been reduced by what seemed like almost a third -
there will be a lot less trash headed to the landfill this
week. The wheel has come full circle: both the free-
gans and their community benefited and that, as my
seventh grade biology teacher taught me, is mutual-
ism.-
My diving partners asked that I don't reveal the
store we visited so it will be safe for future foraging,
but there are a few tips for novice freegans or anyone
who would like to lower their grocery costs.
Look into a supermarket's delivery cycles. One
supermarket might get new shipments of flow-
ers on Fridays and produce on Mondays - mean-
ing that they'll likely be clearing their shelves in
preparation. This varies across supermarkets, so
you'll have to familiarize yourself with your local
