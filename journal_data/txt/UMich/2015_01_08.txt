POTUS’s national 

tour aims to 

emphasize U.S. 

economic recovery

By EMMA KINERY

Daily Staff Reporter

WAYNE, Mich. — President 

Barack Obama visited a Ford 
Motor manufacturing plant 
Wednesday 
to 
speak 
with 

plant employees as part of a 
three-stop tour to promote his 
upcoming State of the Union 
address.

During his remarks, Obama 

previewed his address to the 
nation, noting that he intends 
to emphasize policies designed 
to build on his administration’s 
achievements over the last few 
years. He also used his venue 

to highlight Detroit and the 
auto industry’s improvements 
as one example of the coun-
try’s progress during his time 
in office.

In addition to a stop in 

Michigan, President Obama 
will visit Arizona on Thurs-
day to talk about housing and 
Tennessee on Friday to discuss 
education. The State of the 
Union address is Jan. 20.

On Wednesday, Obama said 

he saw the auto recovery’s 
industry resulted not only from 
his administration’s policies, 
but also the resilience of the 
state’s workers.

“That’s how things work 

best, when everybody’s in it, 
when workers and businesses 
work together,” Obama said. 
“Shared 
sacrifice 
leads 
to 

shared prosperity.”

Remarks focus on 
impact of industry 
ahead of State of the 

Union address

By WILL GREENBERG

Daily News Editor

WAYNE, Mich. — Ahead of 

his State of the Union address on 
Jan. 20, President Barack Obama 

paired Detroit Lions references 
with words of optimism for the 
future in a speech at the Ford 
Michigan Assembly Plant on 
Wednesday.

The president used the town’s 

support for the football team, 
which was eliminated from the 
NFL playoffs this past weekend, 
as a metaphor for the country’s 
support of Detroit and the auto-
mobile industry.

“If there’s one thing that you 

can take to the bank when talk-

ing about Detroit, it’s that Detroit 
always comes back,” Obama said.

The president focused his 

attention 
Wednesday 
on 
the 

auto industry and Detroit’s inte-
gral role in it. He split his time 
between revisiting the decision 
to bail out General Motors and 
Chrysler — now Fiat Chrysler 
Automobiles — and discussing the 
recent growth in U.S. automobile 
sales.

Obama spoke of the initially 

unpopular decision to provide 

bailout money to GM and Chrys-
ler, two of Detroit’s “Big Three” 
automotive companies in 2009. 
He said many feared that if those 
two went under, the third, Ford — 
which was not bailed out — could 
have suffered as well. He noted 
the importance of providing fed-
eral aid along with a strategic 
plan for recovery while trying 
to sustain the U.S. auto industry. 
He said the auto industry needed 
to “change with the times” and 

Hand-drawn logo 
leads to succesful 
business venture 
for LSA senior

By LINDSEY SCULLEN

Daily Staff Reporter

On 
campus, 
LSA 
senior 

Cyrus Tetteh is known as “the 
Cool Club guy.”

It all started in 2011 — his 

freshman year — when he was 
doing math homework in his 
West Quad Residence Hall dorm 
room. He was trying to figure 
out a way to have an impact in 
college immediately and wasn’t 
sure that merely taking classes 
was enough.

“I wanted to feel like I was 

progressing, or climbing a lad-
der in life,” Tetteh said.

The idea and subsequent 

logo he created that day in West 
Quad was for a clothing com-
pany now known as Cool Club 
Clothing, LLC. Today, the com-
pany designs and sells clothing 
items sporting the same “Cool 

Club” logo Tetteh drew on the 
back of his math homework 
three years ago.

The company’s goal this year 

is to put some of Cool Club’s 
proceeds into a startup fund, 
which the company would then 
allocate to people who want to 
“start up their dreams.”

“Cool Club Clothing is based 

on the idea that with an open 
mind you can reach limitless 
heights,” he said. “I never want 
anyone to be restricted or feel 
like they’re restricted in this 
world, because there’s great-
ness in everyone and I just want 
everyone to be able to tap into 
that.”

Tetteh said he was able to tap 

into his own ability to start Cool 
Club Clothing with the help 
of friends like Business senior 
David Carlson. The two met 
during their freshman year as 
roommates in West Quad.

Carlson helped lift Cool Club 

Clothing off the ground by con-
verting Tetteh’s hand-drawn 
logo to a digital form that could 
be sent to a printer.

Washtenaw County

The University of Michigan 

Health System is taking action 

to protect patients from the flu.

Since the start of this year’s 

flu season, UMHS has reported 
four influenza-related deaths. 
To combat the virus, hospital 
officials are enacting new pro-
tocols to keep other patients 
from falling ill.

At the center of the plan is 

a revised visitor policy, which 
asks people who exhibit flu-

like symptoms to avoid visiting 
patients at the hospital, as the 
sick patients are more suscep-
tible to illness than the general 
population.

While the policy recom-

mends anyone exhibiting flu 
symptoms — which can include 
fever, 
body 
aches, 
chills, 

coughing, headache, tiredness,

SAND SHARKS, SKIING AND TORTOISES

During this year’s winter 

break University students 
traveled all over the world, 
experiencing snow, sun and 
penguins.
LSA freshman Abigail Fisher 
traveled to Florida for Winter 
Break with her family.

Fisher’s activities ranged 

from visiting her grandmother 
in Palm Beach to exploring 
the mangroves by jet ski in the 
Keys.

While jet skiing, Fisher 

experienced some wildlife 
firsthand, when she saw sand 
sharks and other animals.

“It was awesome,” she said.
Though Fisher is from 

Michigan, where the semester 
break typically consists of a 

snowy holiday season, she said 
the lack of winter weather did 
not bother her.
Art & Design sophomore Kalli 
Kouf had a ski race with her 
brother, though it was difficult to 
move off the couch.

“I went skiing a lot,” Kouf 

said. “I also didn’t really move 
from my couch that much.”

During one of the times 

when Kalli did move from her 
couch, she and her brother 
raced down a mountain while 
skiing.

“My brother and I raced 

each other while we were ski-
ing, and he beat me by two 
miles per hour,” Kouf said. “I 
was going 47 and he was going 
49, and we were both upset 

that we didn’t hit 50.”
Though he traveled to the Gala-
pagos Islands, LSA junior Ben-
jamin Katz did not see any of its 
famous tortoises.

“They actually only live 

on a few of the islands, and 
in the Galapagos they have 
really strict conservation poli-
cies,” Katz said. “They really 
restrict what islands people 
are allowed to go to.”

And he was disappointed.
“Those are the most iconic 

animals there,” Katz said.

While on the Galapagos 

Islands, Katz did get to see 
penguins, however.

weekly newspaper Charlie Hebdo, at the French Consulate in Barcelona, Spain, Wednesday, Jan 7, 2015. 
French police search for 
Charlie Hebdo shooters

Decrease in 

consumer prices 
raise concerns

PARIS (AP) — Police hunted 

for three heavily armed men with 
possible links to al-Qaida in the 
military-style, methodical kill-
ing of 12 people Wednesday at 
the office of a satirical newspa-
per that caricatured the Prophet 
Muhammad.

President Francois Hollande, 

visiting the scene of France’s 
deadliest such attack in more 
than half a century, called the 
assault on the weekly newspaper 
Charlie Hebdo “an act of excep-
tional barbarism.”

France raised its terror alert 

system to the maximum — Attack 
Alert — and bolstered security 
with more than 800 extra sol-
diers to guard media offices, 
places of worship, transport and 

other sensitive areas. Fears had 
been running high in France and 
elsewhere in Europe that jihadis 
returning from conflicts in Syria 
and Iraq would stage attacks at 
home.

Two officials identified the 

suspects as French brothers Said 
and Cherif Kouachi, in their 
early 30s, and 18-year-old Hamyd 
Mourad, 
whose 
nationality 

wasn’t immediately clear.

Heavily armed police moved 

into the city of Reims, in France’s 
Champagne country east of Paris, 
apparently searching for the 
suspects. Video from BFM-TV 
showed police dressed in white 
apparently taking samples inside 
an apartment. It was not immedi-
ately clear who lived there.

One of the police officials said 

they were linked to a Yemeni ter-
rorist network, and Cedric Le 
Bechec, a witness who encoun-
tered 
the 
escaping 
gunmen, 

quoted the attackers as saying: 

“You can tell the media that it’s 
al-Qaida in Yemen.”

The officials spoke on condi-

tion of anonymity because they 
were not authorized to publicly 
discuss the sensitive and ongoing 
investigation.

Cherif Kouachi was sentenced 

to 18 months in prison after being 
convicted of terrorism charges 
in 2008 for helping funnel fight-
ers to Iraq’s insurgency. He said 
he was outraged at the torture of 
Iraqi inmates at the U.S. prison at 
Abu Ghraib near Baghdad.

The masked, black-clad men 

with assault rifles stormed the 
offices near Paris’ Bastille monu-
ment in the Wednesday noontime 
attack on the publication, which 
had long drawn condemnation 
and threats — it was firebombed 
in 2011 — for its depictions of 
Islam, although it also satirized 
other religions and political fig-
ures.

Shouting “Allahu akbar!” as 

they fired, the men used fluent, 
unaccented French as they called 
out the names of specific employ-
ees.

Artist Corinne Rey told the 

French newspaper L’Humanite 
that she punched in the security 
code to the Charlie Hebdo offices 
after she and her young daughter 
were “brutally threatened” by the 
gunmen.

Eight journalists, two police 

officers, a maintenance worker 
and a visitor were killed, said 
prosecutor Francois Molins. He 
said 11 people were wounded — 
four of them seriously.

After fleeing, the attackers col-

lided with another vehicle, then 
carjacked another car before 
disappearing in broad daylight, 
Molins said.

Among the dead: the paper’s 

editor, Stephane Charbonnier.

The staff was in an editorial 

meeting and the gunmen head-
ed straight for Charbonnier — 
widely known by his pen name 
Charb — killing him and his 
police bodyguard first, said 
Christophe Crepin, a police 
union spokesman.

Authorities hunt 
those responsible 

for 12 murders

LONDON (AP) — The euro-

zone has a new economic head-
ache to contend with.

Consumer 
prices 
fell 
in 

December in the currency bloc 
for the first time in over five years, 
raising concerns of a protracted 
drop that can hurt growth, and 
reinforcing 
expectations 
the 

European Central Bank will pro-
vide an aggressive stimulus.

Lower energy costs pushed 

consumer prices down 0.2 per-
cent in the month from the year 
before, according to a report 
Wednesday by the Eurostat sta-
tistics agency. That’s a big drop 
from the 0.3 percent annual rise 
in prices recorded in November 
and the 0.1 percent drop markets 
were expecting.

The huge impact of weaker oil 

prices is evident in the fact that 
the core inflation rate, which 
excludes volatile items such as 
food, tobacco and energy, rose to 
0.8 percent from 0.7 percent.

Lower prices may sound good 

in principle, especially if they are 

due to a fall in oil prices the euros 
saved filling up a car for less can 
be used elsewhere, promoting 
economic activity. For a region 
stuttering from one quarter of 
anemic growth to the next, every 
little helps.

The problem arises when the 

fall in prices endures, a situation 
that is often referred to as a defla-
tionary spiral. That can choke the 
life out of an economy if consum-
ers put off purchases in the hope 
of future bargains. It can erode 
companies’ profits and make gov-
ernments’ debts appear greater.

Deflation can also prove dif-

ficult to reverse, as evidenced 
by the case of Japan, whose 
economy has stagnated for two 
decades.

Policymakers at the ECB will 

weigh these factors when they 
meet next on Jan. 22. Many in 
the markets think they will be 
fretting about deflation as the 
eurozone, which now counts 19 
members following Lithuania’s 
adoption of the currency this 
year, has seen low inflation for 
months amid subdued growth 
and high unemployment. Sepa-
rate figures Wednesday showed 
unemployment across the euro-
zone remained at a high 11.5 per-

cent in November.

As a result, many economists 

think the ECB will this month back 
a stimulus program that involves 
government bond-buying, some-
thing other central banks such as 
the U.S. Federal Reserve and the 
Bank of England have done over 
the past few years. The ECB, after 
all, doesn’t have much left in its 
arsenal, having already cut inter-
est rates to record lows and backed 
the purchase of some private-sec-
tor bonds.

Expectation for more stimulus 

has weighed heavily on the euro, 
which hit a new 9-year low of 
$1.1802 on Wednesday. Because 
the stimulus would create new 
money, traders are selling the 
currency on the prospect of more 
euros in circulation.

“The emergence of negative 

inflation does forcefully raise the 
specter of a possible prolonged 
period of deflation,” said James 
Ashley, chief European econo-
mist at RBC Capital Markets. 
“For those policymakers who, 
hitherto, might have been unde-
cided over whether or not to take 
further action immediately, this 
may be just the clarion call that 
was required to appreciate the 
gravity of the situation.”

the importance of manufactur-
ing for the economy, and said it 
affects not only the employees 
of an individual plant, but also 
the local economy and ulti-
mately the U.S. economy.

“Plants like this one didn’t 

just build cars,” he said. “They 
built the middle class.”

Continuing to build up the 

middle class through econom-
ic stimulus was a key point 
throughout the event, which 
also 
included 
Secretary 
of 

Labor Thomas Perez and Ford 
employee Mia Dew.

“We have to make sure these 

rising tides lift all boats, and 
not just the yachts,” Perez said 
in his opening remarks.

Along with his discussion 

of the auto industry, Obama 
also highlighted his admin-
istration’s efforts to increase 
apprenticeship programs. Last 
year, Obama called on more 
businesses to create and expand 
apprenticeship programs, and 
recently, the Obama admin-
istration invested $100 mil-
lion in an apprenticeship grant 
competition. Obama said these 
efforts have contributed to the 
largest increase in apprentice-
ships in nearly a decade.

“We want young people to 

see that they have opportuni-
ties,” Obama said. “They don’t 
all have to go to a four year col-
lege; they can get an appren-
ticeship, save some money, start 
working, build a family, buy a 
house.”

He added that nationally, 

87 percent of apprentices are 
employed after they complete 
their apprenticeship program, 
with an average starting wage 
of fifty thousand dollars.

Perez 
also 
emphasized 

apprenticeships as “the other 
college, except you don’t have 

any of the debt.”

Apprenticeships 
are 
also 

an idea Republican Gov. Rick 
Snyder has focused on during 
his tenure. Last May, Snyder 
announced the creation of the 
Michigan Advanced Techni-
cian Training Program.

The program started this 

September and currently works 
with 11 companies. Snyder 
has stated he hopes to expand 
enrollment to 90 students next 
year, as well as the number of 
companies involved.

In his speech, Obama spe-

cifically praised the UAW-Ford 
Joint Apprenticeship Program. 
The program is not affiliated 
with the Michigan Advanced 
Technician Training Program, 
but both focus on encouraging 
technical training.

As he ended his speech, the 

president echoed his support 
for Detroit, as well as his faith 
in an economic recovery.

“We may not all root for the 

(Detroit) Lions, but America is 
rooting for Detroit,” he said. 
“America’s 
coming 
strong. 

America’s coming back. And 
I’m going to be on your side 
every step of the way.”

In response to Obama’s 

remarks, 
Michigan 
GOP 

Chairman 
Bobby 
Schostak 

issued a statement Wednes-
day evening criticizing what 
he 
called 
the 
president’s 

attempts to take credit for the 
auto industry’s recovery.

“It is not surprising that the 

president chose states with 
Republican governors for his 
‘three-city national tour,’ ” 
the statement read. “In the 
wake of Republicans sweep-
ing victory in Michigan and 
across the nation, President 
Obama should take note of the 
commonsense, 
responsible 

policies that are driving the 
economies in the states like 
ours.”

COLUMBUS, Ohio
Airport authorities 
shoot armed man

A man who tried to buy an air-

line ticket using a fake ID was 
fatally shot Wednesday after 
returning to his illegally parked 
car, where he lunged at an airport 
police officer with a knife during 
a confrontation, police said.

The man had multiple knives 

on him and suspicious items in 
his car that led to a bomb squad 
investigation, Columbus police 
Sgt. Rich Weiner said. The man 
was identified only as a Colum-
bus-area resident in his early 40s 
pending notification of his rela-
tives.

WHITE SPRINGS, Fla.
Abused girl shoots 
older brother

Police say a 15-year-old girl 

who killed her 16-year-old broth-
er accused her family of years of 
physical and sexual abuse.

Police 
documents 
released 

Wednesday said the girl’s uncle 
was convicted of molesting her in 
2010. They also say the children’s 
mother discovered the siblings 
having sex.

The girl told investigators after 

the shooting that her parents rou-
tinely kept her locked in a room 
with only a blanket and a bucket to 
urinate in.

The shooting happened Mon-

day. Police say the father is a truck 
driver and his wife goes on trips 
with him, leaving their children at 
home. While they were away, the 
girl broke into her parents’ bed-
room and got a handgun while her 
11-year-old sister kept watch.

SANTA ANA, Calif.
Disney tourists 
contract measles

Seven Californians and two 

people in Utah have confirmed 
cases of measles likely contract-
ed on trips last month to Disney 
theme parks in California, state 
officials said Wednesday.

Three more California residents 

are suspected of having measles. 
All patients with confirmed or sus-
pected cases of the illness visited 
Disneyland or Disney California 
Adventure between Dec. 15 and 
Dec. 20, according to the state’s 
Department of Public Health.

They likely got the airborne 

illness at one of the parks then, 
officials said, adding people with 
measles can be infectious for nine 
days.

SANAA, Yemen
Suicide bomber 
kills 37 in capital

A suicide bomber rammed his 

explosives-laden minibus into a 
gathering of recruits outside a 
police academy in the heart of 
Yemen’s capital on Wednesday, 
killing at least 37 people in the lat-
est high-profile attack to hit Sanaa.

No one immediately claimed 

responsibility for the attack, but 
Yemen’s local al-Qaida branch has 
carried out similar assaults in the 
past against the army and police in 
this impoverished Arabian Penin-
sula country, viewing them as U.S. 
proxies.

Ford spokeswoman Chris-

tin Baker said in a statement 
to the Daily that the company 
was proud both to host the 
president and to contribute to 
a growing U.S. economy. Ford 
has added 24,000 jobs since 
2011.

Obama also made sure to cel-

ebrate Ford and other Ameri-
can auto companies. Speaking 
at the Ford Michigan Assem-
bly Plant, which has added 
1,800 new employees since 
2011 to reach over 5,000 now, 
Obama rallied the crowd while 
announcing the United States 
has experienced 57 consecu-
tive months of job growth and 
11 million jobs have been added 
overall during that period. He 
said growth in manufacturing 
jobs has played a significant 
role in reducing Michigan’s 
unemployment rate, which now 
sits at 7.1 percent, an improve-
ment from 2010’s 14.6 percent.

Additionally, Obama noted 

that the auto companies have 
repaid the bailout money in full 
as of December 2014.

“America’s 
resurgence 
is 

real,” he said. “Don’t let any-
body tell you otherwise. We’ve 
got the best cars and we are 
doing better than just about 
anybody else on earth. And 
now that we’ve got some calm-
er waters, now that the worst of 
the crisis is behind us, if we all 
do our part, if we all pitch in, 
then we can make sure that this 
rising tide is actually lifting all 
the boats.”

The president also noted the 

cooperation between manage-
ment and labor, lauding each 
side’s willingness to make sac-
rifices during hard times.

“We rejected the false choice 

that either unions or businesses 
could succeed but not both,” he 
said.

Multiple reports show the 

auto industry on a steady 
incline. Fiat Chrysler Auto-
mobiles US finished the year 
with a 16-percent increase in 
sales from 2013 and General 
Motors’ sales jumped 5 per-
cent from last year. Ford Motor 
Company saw a 1-percent drop 
in growth in the year, but had 
a better December in 2014 than 
in 2013. On Monday, the Detroit 
Free Press reported that the 
auto industry closed 2014 with 
its fifth consecutive year of 
growth. The industry sold 16.52 
million vehicles, the best per-
formance since 2006.

Additionally, 
Kelley 
Blue 

Book reports show U.S. auto-
mobile prices increasing last 
month, with FCA US increas-
ing 2.3 percent from December 
2013, GM up 4 percent and Ford 
up 3.4 percent.

Don Grimes, a CLMR senior 

research area specialist for 
the University’s Institute for 
Research on Labor, Employ-
ment and the Economy, said 
automobiles are still a “prod-
uct people want.” He said he 
expects to see the industry con-
tinue to grow — though it is still 
subject to ups and downs over 
time.

“They weren’t making a 

product that was going away 
— it wasn’t like they were mak-
ing carriages after they’ve been 
replaced with the auto indus-
try,” Grimes said. “You were 

going to get a cyclical rebound 
and recovery in the auto indus-
try because they were still 
making products that people 
still wanted to buy.”

Grimes said a positive sign 

has been the Big Three stabi-
lizing their market shares, now 
controlling almost 45 percent 
of the market after a period of 
post-recession decline.

In his speech, Obama com-

mended Detroit on Wednesday 
for its handling of the munici-
pal bankruptcy as a sign of the 
city’s resilience.

Obama has made several 

trips to Southeast Michigan 
during his presidency, includ-
ing stops in Ann Arbor and 
Detroit. Obama’s most recent 
trip to Detroit in November 
aimed to rally support for Dem-
ocratic congressional-level and 
state-level candidates for the 
2014 midterm elections. He 
also emphasized the industry’s 
resurgence then.

“I don’t have to tell you the 

auto industry that was on the 
brink of collapse is back on its 
feet, making better cars than 
ever, right here in Michigan,” 
he said in November. “It’s a tes-
tament to the grit and the resil-
ience of American workers.”

Secretary of Labor Thomas 

Perez spoke briefly before the 
president 
arrived 
Wednes-

day, and echoed a similar sen-
timent. Perez said the auto 
industry wasn’t ready to die 
when Obama came into office, 
and Obama didn’t let it happen.

“The future is unquestion-

ably bright because of your guts, 
your grit, your determination, 
your stick-to-itiveness, your 
partnership, your resolve,” he 
said, speaking to the mostly 
Ford-employed audience.

Engineering junior Pavan 

Naik is the project manager 
for the Michigan Solar Car 
Team, and leads the building 
of the team’s vehicle, “Quan-
tum”. Naik said he joined the 
team early his freshman year 
because of the variety of oppor-
tunities offered within the pro-
gram.

“I was looking to do some-

thing hands-on outside of the 
classroom,” Naik said. “The 
solar car team was particularly 
interesting because of the wide 
variety of fields you can go 
into.”

Naik said members of the 

team, which draws students 
majoring in anything from 
engineering to art, spend more 
time working on their solar car 
than they do in class.

“We like to joke around that 

we go to Michigan for the solar 
car team and we’re part-time 
students on the side,” he said. 
“It really varies for the amount 
of work that people do for the 
team. An easy week can be 40 
hours a week and that can go 
up to 100.”

The team has competed in 

other 
international 
venues 

before. Since 1990, they’ve 
traveled to Australia for the 
World Solar Challenge, where 
they placed 9th in 2013.

Naik said this race differs 

from other races the team has 
done. In addition to racing stu-
dents from Abu Dhabi Univer-
sity, the participants will also 
help their Abu Dhabi counter-

parts create a solar car team.

“Normally, we’ll build a car, 

we’ll go to Australia and we’ll 
race it. But in this race, we’re 
partnering 
with 
the 
team 

from the Abu Dhabi Univer-
sity,” Naik said. “We’re going 
there to teach them how to 
start their own solar car team. 
We’re racing with them as 
well, so it’s a learning oppor-
tunity on both ends.”

And the students from Abu 

Dhabi University are looking 
forward to working with the 
Michigan Solar Car Team.

“I am looking forward to 

gaining valuable experience 
from the U-M Solar Car Team,” 
said

Mohammed Habeebuddin, a 
mechanical engineering stu-
dent at Abu Dhabi University,

it will be an unforgettable 
learning experience for me.”

sore throat and nasal conges-
tion — to avoid the hospital if 
they’re not seeking treatment, 
it also provides guidelines for 
those who choose to visit. Visi-
tors with symptoms who must 
visit the hospital are required 
to wear a mask. UMHS initiat-
ed a similar protocol last year.

The 
policy 
also 
main-

tains a year-round procedure 
designed to protect young visi-
tors. No child younger than 12 
years old is permitted to enter 
the room of a patient who is 
known or suspected to have 
the flu.

The main strain of flu cur-

rently circulating is Influenza 
A, or H3N2. UMHS epidemi-
ologist Laraine Washer said 
the number of hospitalizations 
for those who have contracted 
this strain is high.

“As of this week, we have 

almost 
500 
lab 
confirmed 

cases and about 200 patients 
are hospitalized,” Washer said.

Some experts have deemed 

the current flu season as more 
severe than in recent years. 
The Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention announced 
in December that flu vaccines 
may not be enough protection 
against the strain.

Even so, experts still con-

sider flu shots important for 
protecting against the virus. 
U.S. News reported in Decem-
ber that flu shots remain the 
“single most effective way to 
protect against flu.” In addi-
tion to flu shots, several anti-
viral 
medications 
such 
as 

Tamiflu and Relenza have 
proven effective for fighting 
the flu.

Eden Wells, associate pro-

fessor 
of 
epidemiology 
at 

the School of Public Health, 
encouraged all University stu-
dents to get vaccinated.

“If you are not vaccinated, 

start and be aware that the 
vaccine takes some time to 
build up immunity in your sys-
tem,” Wells said.

Susan 
Ringler-Cerniglia, 

public information officer at 
the Washtenaw County Pub-
lic Health Department, said 
UMHS is on the right track 
with the Healthy Visitor Policy.

“As a health department, 

we encourage anything that 
reduces the spread of illness,” 
Ringler-Cerniglia said. “When 
things are circulating, it cer-
tainly makes sense for them to 
restrict their policy and try to 
reduce the spread.”

Flu vaccines are still avail-

able and Washtenaw County 
residents can obtain $25 vac-
cinations through the county’s 
public health department.

look, the brand on a napkin 
actually one time,” Carlson 
said. “I still have the original 
file.”

After designing the ini-

tial template, Carlson taught 
Tetteh InDesign, Adobe Pho-
toshop and Adobe Illustrator 
so that they would have the 
ability to move forward with 
the company.

Tetteh sends his designs to 

a variety of printers, includ-
ing Dynasty Artistic Designs, 
Underground 
Printing 
and 

Ann Arbor T-shirt Company. 
He also assembles his own 
customized 
clothing 
using 

iron-on heat transfers at home.

The company’s most popu-

lar items are the “pom beanie” 
colored winter hats. Other 
products include sweatshirts, 
T-shirts and pins. Tetteh said 
he also meets with customers 
to make personalized custom 
designs upon request.

“I hope to be at the point 

one day where I can just walk 
down the street and see some-
one wearing Cool Club that I’d 
never met before,” Tetteh said.

Tetteh was quick to add, 

however, that the company’s 
“personal feel” is important 
to him. While a lot of his sales 
occur online, much of his 
business network comes from 
in-person connections with 
friends and friends-of-friends.

“A lot of the people that I 

sell to, I get to know them and 
I know who they are,” Tetteh 
said. “I still love the fact that I 
know people and that it’s gen-
uine support that they have for 
me.”

For a semester in 2013, 

Tetteh networked through an 
executive board he set up for 
the enterprise — a strategy he 
used to get the company up 
and running.

Though at the time he 

was unsure if there would 
be strong interest, 14 people 
applied and joined the semes-
ter-long project.

In addition to running a 

handful of “pop-up shops” on 
multiple occasions — the St. 
Patrick’s Day sale being one of 
the most notable — the team 
also held an event with Denard 
Robinson, former quarterback 
of the Michigan football team.

Tetteh said he ran into Rob-

inson one day in the Union, 
and a friend convinced him to 

go talk to Robinson about Cool 
Club.

“He was really friendly,” 

Tetteh said. “He was like, ‘I 
really like what you’re doing, I 
really support this, I like peo-
ple who are doing their thing. 
If you ever need anything, just 
let me know.’ “

Robinson gave Tetteh his 

number and the two later con-
nected to schedule an event he 
called “The Hangout” in the 
Michigan Union’s basement.

“It was just a great day; we 

sold a lot of items,” Tetteh said. 
“People came from all over. 
People were lined up at the 
event to see Denard and they 
bought clothes like Denard. 
He really helped me out.”

Though the semester-long 

executive board project ended 
two years ago, much of the 
team still remains very sup-
portive.

LSA senior Paige Blessman 

served as the vice president of 
Cool Club Clothing during the 
project. She said that the Cool 
Club team still functions as a 
group of people who support 
each other in their personal 
dreams.

“I love Cool Club Cloth-

ing,” Blessman said. “We like 
to support individuality, we 
know that everyone has their 
own separate dream — Cyrus 
started his own company and 
he likes to support other peo-
ple’s dreams. One dream that I 
know I have is I look forward 
to having my own magazine 
one day or some of the people 
want to have their own law 
firm or their own clothing line 
and whatnot.”

It’s this mutual support that 

Cool Club aims to build on as 
it strives to create the new 
startup fund that would help 
fund individuals — particular-
ly students — in their personal 
endeavors.

Tetteh said he plans to cre-

ate the startup fund soon, 
which he hopes will raise the 
profile of Cool Club Clothing. 
He plans to leave a representa-
tive of the company here at the 
University when he graduates 
to promote the company and 
manage the startup fund.

Carlson forecasted an opti-

mistic future for the com-
pany. He referenced both the 
startup fund, as well as future 
increased advertising efforts.

“If you don’t know about 

Cool Club Clothing, you will 
within the next six months,” 
he said.

T

his past week, Gina Kolata 
of The New York Times 
reported on the develop-

ment of a new 
paradigm 
in 

genetics research: 
the pursuit and 
identification 
of 

beneficial 
muta-

tions. 
Genet-

ics 
constitutes 

a major focus of 
medical research 
right now, and the 
rise of “personal-
ized 
medicine” 

research has been 
well documented 
(as having positive and negative 
effects). In personalized medicine, 
researchers use DNA sequencing 
technology to discover influential 
mutations on human health. The 
fundamental 
undercurrent 
here 

is that much of human health is 
endowed by our personal genetic 
codes (read: imperfectly correlated).

These discoveries can then be fur-

ther explored in research, as well as 
communicated to patients. 23andme 
is the prominent manifestation of 
personalized medicine in industry.

The Times piece profiles one 

Doug Whitney, who has a mutation 
that has been demonstrated in pre-
vious research studies to cause ear-
ly-onset Alzheimer’s disease. It’s a 
deadly alteration that, taken in iso-
lation, has a bleak prognosis. How-
ever, Whitney has shown none of 
the symptoms typically presented 
by the disease at his age. In medi-
cine, we would call him an outlier. 

In statistics, we would call him the 
“tail” of the curve. In religious 
circles, we might call him a mir-
acle. Kolata reports that medical 
researchers have begun to seek out 
these blips at the tail of the curves 
in the effort to identify the core 
genetic origin of their good fortune. 
In other words, they are looking for 
mutants of the good variety: living, 
breathing, medical X-Men.

Real-life mutants have long been 

an interest of comic junkies every-
where, and I was no exception as a 
kid. I often imagined what it would 
be like to have superpowers. Still 
do. This is, though, perhaps less 
dramatic and sexy than shooting 
ice out of your hands, the realiza-
tion of this fantasy in an intriguing 
way. So cool! And yet, as illustrated 
in the darker subtext of X-Men – as 
well as in comics like Watchmen — 
the exposure of mutants in society 
introduces a whole host of ethical 
issues. In the comics, these issues 
promote discrimination and social 
segregation. Similar issues have 
been demonstrated with the rise 
of personalized medicine across 
diverse 
social 
arenas, 
ranging 

from individual insurance costs to 
marriage partner selection among 
many others.

Accordingly, 
privacy 
rights 

and protection is a focal point for 
discussion when considering the 
potential proliferation of person-
alized medicine. It seems that the 
question of privacy will be the one 
of our time, with the ubiquitous 
spread of information in the Inter-
net dimension of our lives. As per-

sonalized medicine continues to 
progress and advance, we will be 
forced to think about these ethical 
issues. One such question already 
popping up is whether or not to 
sequence the genomes of newborns: 
one camp says this provides an 
opportunity for prophylactic treat-
ment and active monitoring, while 
the other worries that it introduces 
a tremendous burden of stress by 
providing a window into one’s fate.

Obviously, there is no single 

answer with regards to balanc-
ing stress and knowledge. After 
all, whether or not to eat from the 
Tree of Knowledge has always been 
the human question. A phenom-
enal, eloquent op-ed in the Times 
from last September addresses 
these questions, from the angle 
of “guilty pleasures.” The balance 
between “extension of life” and 
“delay of death,” as it applies to the 
ever-desired stretching of human 
longevity, is also prominently dis-
cussed by Zeke Emanuel.

The only clear takeaway is 

that these questions are intensely 
individual, and that they aren’t 
 

going away.

We will be forced to grapple 

with these questions in the future 
as patients and parents, citizens 
and scholars. For now, though, we 
ought to appreciate the profound 
implications of such magnificent 
advances in science. The “mutant” 
fantasy is materializing, pros and 
cons with it!

Walk the (nature) walk

L

ast semester I took Bio 101. To the 
untrained eye (and likely to the 
trained eye) this class appears to be a 

basic Intro to Biology class 
for freshmen who have 
their shit together enough 
to know they are on the pre-
med track (these are the same students who 
took Orgo first semester to “get it out of the 
way”). But Bio 101 was actually cross-listed as 
Environ 101 with the title “Food, Energy and 
the Environment” and was billed as a science 
class for non-science majors in LSA looking to 
fulfill their natural science requirement.

Except it was so much more than that. I’ve 

never taken a class before that spoke to me 
so urgently. I’ve always loved nature, but I’ve 
never before felt the call to action, the need to 
make a change and really do something to pro-
tect this amazing, intricately beautiful planet.

Some people have godly moments in church 

or a synagogue or a mosque or some other reli-
gious location, where they feel connected with 
god and the world and for one brief moment can 
see everything in life clearly and in perspec-
tive. For me, every moment I’ve had like that 
has come in nature. There’s something about 
standing waist deep in an ocean surrounded 
by mountains, or lying on the forest floor dur-
ing an epic storm that makes a person feel their 
place in the universe. And even though nature 
can make you feel small, it also makes you feel 
deeply connected to the world surrounding 
you. Other than the fact that Earth is the only 
known planet to sustain life, that is why it is 
important to protect nature.

There’s a type of quiet, simple peace that 

can be found outside. My sister, Natalie, 
explained to me why everyone feels so at 
peace in nature — it’s because we are a part of 
nature. We are a part of the wondrous cycles 
of life that cause trees to grow every sum-
mer, cause leaves to change colors and cause 
plants to use nitrogen in the ground to grow 
and take in carbon from the atmosphere. 
After all, we breathe out carbon, and trees 
and other plants breathe it in and breathe out 
oxygen. We are naturally a part of the same 
cycle. We are in an interdependent relation-
ship with the rest of nature. But somewhere 
along the line, we forgot our role in this cycle.

Prof. John Vandermeer, the professor of 

my Bio/Enviro 101 class, would probably say 
this change began with the start of agricul-
ture, but really took hold after World War I, 
when instead of being in a partnership with 
nature (where farmers were the doctors and 
crops and nature were the patients), the agri-
cultural ideology switched to a militaristic 
one, where farmers had to conquer and take 

advantage of and pillage their farms. This 
was a drastic misstep.

Bio 101 really awoke me to the issues that 

are occurring within the current agricul-
ture and food systems, and made me want to 
do something about it. But when the issues 
seem so insurmountable and simultaneously 
important to address as soon as possible, it’s 
difficult to decide what to do. Because I really 
do want to do something, even the smallest 
thing, to help the Earth. There are a million 
things wrong with the world, but none of 
those problems can be solved if we don’t have 
a planet to live on.

There’s just something about being in 

nature. I want my children (and if I don’t have 
children, then just future generations) to have 
the opportunity to go out and experience the 
wilderness, to see mountains and forests and 
rock formations and rivers and waterfalls 
and lakes and oceans. Because seeing these 
natural wonders and climbing and hiking 
through them not only makes you apprecia-
tive and deeply protective of this world, but 
it reveals and heals parts of yourself that you 
may not have even known were there or in 
need of healing. Nature puts everything into 
perspective and is a kind of deep, personal 
therapy. We cannot exist without it.

In class, Professor Vandermeer and my GSI 

Jonno said to get involved by doing something 
you love. We watched a video where a cartoon 
baker got involved in helping with climate 
change by providing food for volunteers and 
having bake sales to raise money and aware-
ness. I do not know much about what I want 
out of life, but I know that I love nature, and 
that I love to write. So I thought that if I write 
about nature, and about my struggles to live a 
sustainable life while simultaneously being a 
college freshman in a sorority, maybe I could 
inspire other people (and myself) to live in a 
way that is sustainable.

Because for me at least, it’s easy to say I 

want to live a sustainable life and help save 
the planet, while simultaneously not recy-
cling, eating food produced by big businesses, 
and not supporting local, sustainable food. 
This semester I’m going to try to actually 
be sustainable (walk the walk, so to speak), 
and I hope this column will not only keep 
me accountable (because on my own I have 
an embarrassingly low amount of willpower), 
but also inspire other environment-lovers (I 
know you’re out there), and even people who 
think recycling is just a hipster fad, to try to 
live in a way that could help save the world.

A newer resolution

E

very January brings its predictable 
wave of diet commercials for intrepid 
resolutioners. A woman stands inside 

of one leg of her “before” 
jeans, holding the waistband 
out with one arm to show 
off the other pant leg like 
a massive denim sail. It’s all thanks to frozen 
dinners! If they can do it, so can you!

I find it exhaustingly annoying.
It’s not even the gimmicky aspect of it, 

that transparent attempt to use inspirational 
weight-loss stories to sell unnecessary diet 
products. It’s that the success of the multi-bil-
lion dollar diet industry is built upon accepting 
the theory that a slimmer waistline is tanta-
mount to a better life. The theory is that losing 
weight will lead to improved beauty and health, 
which are two intangible things that are almost 
universally desired. (Who doesn’t want to be 
healthier and more attractive?) The problem is 
that the theory is held as a certain truth, when 
it’s actually a shared public delusion.

Every year, the commercials serve as a 

reminder of the American values of health and 
beauty, and I can’t help but feel that a lot of 
people’s needs are left behind by these values. I 
feel a lot more than annoyance when I see that 
woman standing in one pant leg. I feel panicky. 
I feel that knot in my stomach as I remember 
two of my friends from high school and the eat-
ing disorders they battled. I hope for an irra-
tional moment that my friends won’t see any of 
the ads this year. But the diet commercials are 
everywhere: unavoidable, ubiquitous. I know 
they’ll see the ads, and I have to know that 
they’ll be able to manage their own mental ill-
nesses despite the constant barrage of images 
depicting dieting as the cure to unhappiness.

The obsession with physical fitness as a New 

Year’s resolution is as real in practice as it is in 
advertising — just try snagging a vacant ellipti-
cal at the Central Campus Recreational Build-
ing during January. I’m not saying that making 
changes to live a healthier lifestyle is a bad 
thing. Of course, eating healthfully and get-
ting exercise can improve your health, mood 

and body image. But I do fear that too much of 
our New Year’s attention is devoted to physical 
health, often at the expense of mental health.

It isn’t only eating disorders that worry me 

in the midst of diet resolutions. While high 
hopes of fitness are on the rise, so too is mental 
illness. Seasonal affective disorder, often nick-
named “winter depression,” becomes more 
debilitating as daylight hours dwindle. A new 
year will bring new challenges that will be 
mentally and emotionally taxing, but the focus 
of the resolution industry is not on prepar-
ing our minds for these challenges. Roughly a 
quarter of Americans are estimated to suffer 
from a diagnosable mental illness, and yet the 
conversation about improving our lives every 
January never seems to speak to this popula-
tion. We see commercials for the local gym and 
not the local therapist. We read success stories 
of weight management and not about manag-
ing anxiety disorders. We are taught to strive 
for toned physiques while nothing is said about 
the brain that pilots the toned body.

After cholesterol medications, antidepres-

sants are the most prescribed drugs in Amer-
ica, but there is still a stigma associated with 
taking them. Mental illnesses are viewed 
differently than other diseases, where tak-
ing meds can seem like a personal deficiency 
rather than a way of taking control of one’s 
health. A new year offers us a new opportunity 
to rethink the definition of what it means to be 
healthy, maybe this time with room for healthy 
minds. This year, we can resolve to give our 
brains some TLC, and to foster an environment 
where our peers can, too. A visit to Counseling 
and Psychological Services in the Union might 
do as much good as a visit to the CCRB. Let’s 
talk about therapists like we talk about per-
sonal trainers. Let’s talk about antidepressants 
like we talk about antibiotics. Let’s talk about 
it, because the resolution industry won’t.

Let’s make 2015 the year we resolve to 

improve our mental health.

A

s an out-of-state student, my 
grossly inflated tuition isn’t 
the only difference between 

my home state and the one I call my 
hoMe for eight months of the year. 
I’m a native of Northern California. 
Four years ago when I stepped 
onto the University’s campus, the 
Midwest might have well been Mars 
for all I knew about it. The longer I 
live in Michigan, the more quirky 
and 
contrasting 
characteristics 

I notice between my two homes. 
And, like any college student, those 
differences are described perfectly 
by my love life.

My junior year, I fell for two guys, 

one from my home state of Califor-
nia and one from the Midwest. Both 
good guys. Both fun guys. Both 
broke my heart and both were the 
embodiment of their home regions.

I met Midwest at my job. And like 

any self-respecting Michigan Man, 
he knew exactly what he wanted 
to do with his life. Every free sec-
ond was devoted to advancing his 
career. Internships, extracurricular 
activities, summers and classes all 
fervently dedicated to giving him-
self the best opportunity to succeed 
in his chosen profession. Every sec-
ond he wasn’t watching the Tigers 
or football, that is. He seemed to 
have his whole life figured out. If he 
didn’t, he faked it pretty damn well. 
And not just school- or career-wise. 
This kid knew he wanted to marry a 
Jewish girl, live in the Midwest and 
take his kids to Michigan football 
games after Little League practice. 
He was ready to be a middle-aged 
man at 21.

At Michigan, everyone around 

me seems to know what they are 
going to be doing in 10 years. The 
ones who don’t have still memo-
rized one-liners to give to people 
who ask, “and what are you going 
to do with that major?” even if they 
don’t believe in what they are saying 
at all.

California 
was 
directionless, 

and completely up front about it. 
He took general education require-
ments at his college and that was 
the only career choice he had made. 
He didn’t have a 10-year plan — he 
didn’t have a five-month plan. He 

loved playing the field when it came 
to girls and didn’t have the word 
“marriage” in his vocabulary, let 
alone in his 10-year plan. He didn’t 
pretend he knew what the hell he 
was doing. His absence of life choic-
es was refreshing. It was like his life 
would sneak up on him. Tricking 
him into the choices he made. He 
lived in the present, because that 
was honestly all he really had.

The people in my hometown 

maybe have some idea of where 
they would like to end up, but it’s 
hazy at best and usually more like 
an abyss. But they own this fact. 
They don’t feel the pressure to fake 
a life plan, something I see often 
in Michigan. Of course they have 
moments of doubt where feelings 
of 
purposelessness 
overwhelm 

them. But they smoke a bowl and 
have friends remind them they’re 
only 21.

Midwest 
was 
obsessed 
with 

social media and it fueled my obses-
sion with him. Twitter, Facebook 
and Instagram. If I really wanted 
to, I could “accidently on purpose” 
run into him every day. His every 
movement was posted online. I have 
to admit he might have been an 
extreme example, but it does seem 
like the state of Michigan is much 
more intent on sharing their lives 
on the internet than my home town 
(ironic since my home town is Palo 
Alto where most of those networks 
were created). My friends at Michi-
gan desire to become insta-famous. 
Every holiday, birthday or anniver-
sary has a photo collage posted on 
both Facebook and Instagram. Yik 
Yak is infinitely more popular, and 
better, on campus at U of M than 
 

at Stanford.

California made fun of me for 

having a Twitter even though “I 
only use it for news, I promise.” 
He rarely posted to the one social 
network he had, Facebook, and 
had a total of 134 pictures. (Mid-
west had around 1,000). While I 
love that the Northern California 
region is less likely to live their lives 
solely online, it was frustrating 
because he took forever to answer 
 

Facebook messages.

The Michigan and the Midwest 

region had a reputation for being 
the nice and polite part of Amer-
ica — as rude as New Yorkers are 
is how nice Midwesterners are. In 
my experience, Midwesterners are 
nice, but more than that, they want 
to avoid confrontation. Midwest 
couldn’t be honest with me if he 
thought it would make me upset or 
uncomfortable. He had difficult or 
uncomfortable conversations over 
text, not in person.

California liked to sext. And text 

about “How I Met Your Mother” or 
about pretty much anything. We 
texted a lot and most of it was about 
nothing at all. But when we had to 
have those hard conversations, I 
was the one running away from 
confrontation, not him.

These guys had similarities that 

I loved just as the Midwest and 
California do. They were likeable 
people who were easy to talk to. I 
have never had a hard time making 
friends in California (once out of 
the horror of high school) or Michi-
gan. People are open and genuinely 
interested in the people around 
them in both places.

They were both chivalrous. Mid-

west wouldn’t let me walk home if 
it was past midnight, insisting on 
driving me the two blocks to my 
house. California always walked on 
the car-side of me when we were 
walking down a busy street. So 
moms of California and Michigan, 
you taught your sons well.

While different in many ways, 

neither was better than the other, 
both of the boys and both of my 
homes. Every time I go back to 
Palo Alto I think, “This is where I 
am supposed to be. This is where I 
fit in.” Then two months later I’m 
craving to go back to the Mitten. I 
arrive at DTW and I think, “Now 
I’m really where I am supposed to 
be.” And by Thanksgiving I am sick 
of my roommates and ready to see 
my high school friends. The cycle 
continues and has continued for 
four years. I have finally accepted 
that both places are exactly where 
I belong.

New year, new classes, colder weather
Why winter semester is better

By Jaclyn Nagel, Weekend Roundup Contributor | Photos by Paul Sherman and Allison Farrand

Friday, 1/9

A

ll right, I’m going to be 
honest with you. There 
are not a lot of reasons 

winter semester is better than 
fall semester. However, to 
avoid seasonal sadness, I have 
come up with ways to look on 
the bright side of this very 
cold semester.

IT’S TOO COLD TO GO 

OUT

Feeling 
antisocial? 
Not 

quite ready to leave your 
bed? Almost done with sea-
son seven of “Gilmore Girls”? 
Now you have the perfect 
excuse to stay curled up with 
your hot chocolate and laptop 
to avoid the Polar Vortex 2.0 
that is unfortunately taking 
place outside your window. 
Besides, who wants to wait in 
a 40-minute long Cantina line 
without a jacket anyways? 

Not me.

WE 
COULD 
BE 
A 

BASKETBALL 
SCHOOL...

OR A HOCKEY SCHOOL

Our football season ended 

without a coach, a permanent 
athletic director or a decent 
record, but thankfully the 
football season is something 
of the fall semester past. 

While our basketball sea-

son is off to a rough start, 
things could still turn around. 
Though on the off chance that 
we get worse instead of better 
… we could always be a hockey 
school!

CANCELED CLASSES

Fall semester classes are 

rarely cancelled. Professors 
are well rested from the 
summer and the weather is 
still tolerable. 

But winter semester holds 

the possibility of much less 
class. The arctic tundra that 
is Ann Arbor could be home to 
another cold day this semester 
(start praying). Though we’ve 
only had one in the past 38 
years. But I’m trying to look at 
the bright side, OK?

IMPRESS YOUR BAE

Whether 
it’s 
Valentine’s 

Day or just a random Satur-
day, winter semester is full 
of 
cute 
date 
possibilities. 

Head to Yost at night to watch 
hockey team or try skating on 
your own. Plus, now that it has 
finally snowed in Ann Arbor, 
take a walk (or go sledding) in 
Ann Arbor’s very own winter 
wonderland (AKA: the Arb).

THE BEST BREAK OF THE 

YEAR

You’ve been hearing about 

it since before your first kiss. 
You’ve been planning it since 
before your first homecoming. 
It only comes four times and 
only during winter semester. 
Whether you’re heading to the 
slopes or to a tropical beach 
where the legal drinking age 
is barely 18, Spring Break is 
something that makes winter 
semester totally worth it.

3 THINGS

to kick off second 
semester

By ALLANA AKHTAR
Weekend Roundup Editor

Winter semester has begun. 

For seniors, this may mean 
your final semester of being 
an undergrad. What better 
way to celebrate the closing of 
your college career than with 
10-degree 
Michigan 
wind 

chills?

For the rest of the Univer-

sity, winter semester definitely 
has its perks. Here are three 
ways to kick off four months 
of walking to class dressed like 
you’re in the North Pole:

RESTAURANT WEEK

It’s that time of year again: 

the time you can eat at some of 
your favorite downtown Ann 
Arbor restaurants without the 
guilt of emptying your wallet.

Many 
restaurants 
take 

advantage of Ann Arbor’s 
biannual Restaurant Week to 
highlight their very best lunch 
and dinner dishes. Most loca-
tions offer lunch for two for 
$15 and dinner for two for $28.

This 
year’s 
Restaurant 

Week begins Jan. 18. Get your 
friends together and make res-
ervations fast — there can be 
really long lines!

GRAB BASKETBALL 

TICKETS

Although Football Satur-

days are an integral part of fall 
semester, it doesn’t mean our 
other hard-working student-
athletes should go unnoticed.

If you didn’t already buy 

season tickets, you can always 
try Facebook groups, StubHub 
or word of mouth to get a seat 
at the Crisler Center. Upcom-
ing home games are against 
Minnesota, Northwestern and 
Wisconsin.

Other teams to support this 

semester are ice hockey, men’s 
and women’s swimming and 
diving, gymnastics and wom-
en’s basketball.

TAKE 
THE 
BUS 
TO 

DETROIT

As a native of the Metro 

Detroit suburbs, I can say 
with authority that winters in 
Detroit can be much more fun 
than the summers.

The Detroit Center Connec-

tor, the University’s public bus 
to the motor city, offers rides 
beginning Jan. 15. Apart from 
making an essential trip to the 
Detroit Institute of Arts, try 
the bean burger at Traffic Jam 
& Snug and ice skate in Cam-
pus Martius Park on Wood-
ward Avenue.

The world-renowned North 

American International Auto 
Show is another great reason 
to venture to the city later 
this month. This year, the 
gallery will feature an esti-
mated $5.5 million worth of 
exotic vehicles from 60 differ-
ent countries. The show will 
also feature its first “Tech-
nology Showcase” to explore 
the 
development 
high-tech 

advancements in motor vehi-
cles.

WJC players back to Ann Arbor

Four Wolverines 
return in time for 

big Minnesota 
series at home

By JASON RUBINSTEIN

Daily Sports Editor

The Michigan hockey team 

surprised almost everyone by 
capturing its 16th Great Lakes 
Invitational 
championship, 
considering 
it 

played without four of its best 
players.

Now, 
with 
sophomore 

forwards 
JT 
Compher 
and 

Tyler Motte, freshman forward 
Dylan Larkin and freshman 
defenseman Zach Werenski back 
in Ann Arbor after representing 
the United States at the World 
Junior 
Championships, 
the 

worries have shifted toward how 
these four dynamic players will 
fit back into the lineup.

“Obviously they are a big part 

of our team,” said Michigan 
coach Red Berenson. “Hopefully 
they can come in and pick it up 
where they left off. That’s the 
one thing you worry about with 
the tournament. Sometimes they 
come back and they are flying 
like (former Wolverine Jacob) 
Trouba was.

“But sometimes they come 

back with a tail between their 
legs, losing their confidence 
because they didn’t play well or 
they lost.”

Berenson’s 
worries 
seem 

validated 
considering 
the 

heartbreak 
the 
participants 

felt after losing to Russia in the 
quarterfinals and failing to reach 
the medal round.

“It didn’t go as planned,” 

Larkin said. “We wanted to make 
it to the medal rounds at least. 
It’s tough to work so hard and 
come up short.”

Luckily for the Wolverines, 

junior forward Andrew Copp 
can empathize with Compher, 
Larkin, Motte and Werenski. 
Copp, a participant for Team 
USA in last year’s WJC, also 
failed to medal, losing to Russia 

in the quarterfinals.

Copp said he felt dejected after 

the loss, and it was on his mind for 
a few days after. But a year wiser, 
the captain understands the 
importance of quickly moving 
past the heartbreak — especially 
considering 
the 
Wolverines 

are still looking to bolster their 
tournament résumé.

“For me, last year, it was 

pretty tough, and then the next 
few days you think about it,” 
Copp said. “But once you’re back 
here and back with this group of 
guys, you’re worried about other 
things and not too worried about 
Russia.

“I talked to the guys about it 

and we kind of talked about how 
much we hate Russia. But it’s 
over with now.”

FASCHING A FOE?: For 

Copp and Larkin, this weekend’s 
two-game series against No. 9 
Minnesota will mean bragging 
rights are up for grabs with a 
good friend.

Hudson 
Fasching, 
a 

sophomore 
forward 
for 

Minnesota, has been linemates 
with Copp and Larkin before. At 
the 2014 WJC, Fasching skated 
alongside Copp and 2012 NHL 
first-round draft pick Stefan 
Matteau. 
The 
trio 
became 

known as the “grind line” and 
was perhaps the team’s best line.

Just two weeks ago, Fasching 

became linemates with Larkin 
and, once again, helped create 
the Americans’ best line with 
a Wolverine. Larkin ended the 
WJC with five goals and two 
assists, in large part thanks to 
Fasching.

“He’s a lot like Zach Hyman,” 

Larkin said of Fasching. “He 
works really hard, going after 
every loose puck in the corner. 
He’s always going to be in the 
dirty areas and play a tough 
game.”

But come Friday night at Yost 

Ice Arena, Fasching will be a foe, 
not someone Copp or Larkin can 
look to for help. Copp loves the 
challenge of playing his longtime 
friend, though.

“It’s a little bit of fun out 

there,” Copp said. “We crack 
some jokes once in a while 
during warm-ups, shoot a puck 
at him or something. But once 
the game goes and you’re in the 
other jersey, you’re trying to win 
and that is all that matters.”

BERENSON 
SATISFIED: 

Michigan’s 16th GLI title wasn’t 
the only thing Michigan fans 
celebrated 
over 
the 
holiday 

break. Wolverine fans across 
the country were cheering the 
football program’s recent hire of 
prolific coach Jim Harbaugh.

“I 
went 
to 
the 
press 

conference,” Berenson said. “I 
thought it was terrific. It was 
great. It was a media frenzy, 
but it was positive. It was one 
of the better news items around 
Michigan here for a while.”

Despite 
his 
presence 
at 

Harbaugh’s press conference, he 
hasn’t spoken with Harbaugh.

“I didn’t want to bother him,” 

Berenson said. “It was his first 
day on campus, and it was a 
madhouse. But I’ll get to meet 
him plenty.”

Albrecht aids offense as starter
Point guard helps 
reignite offense 
as starter against 

Penn State

By DANIEL FELDMAN

Daily Sports Editor

It was clear the Michigan 

men’s basketball team needed 
a change to fix its offensive 
ineptitude against Purdue last 
Saturday.

It turned out the solution was 

simple. In came junior guard 
Spike Albrecht and out went 
freshman 
forward 
Kameron 

Chatman from the starting 
lineup, and the change helped 
lift the Wolverines to a victory 
at Penn State on Tuesday.

Simply 
put, 
the 
move 

represented a desire to go 
to a smaller starting lineup, 
something Michigan coach John 
Beilein has done frequently this 
season and in the past. Even 
though Albrecht, the team’s 
eldest statesman, has played 
the fourth-most minutes this 
season, he had yet to start a 
game.

After the Wolverines shot an 

abysmal 18.2 percent from the 
field against the Boilermakers as 
the result of poor shot choices, 
little movement on offense and 
an inability to get shots in the 
paint, a possible solution was to 
get both point guards, Albrecht 
and sophomore Derrick Walton 
Jr., on the court from the start to 
get the ball moving.

“One of the reasons we 

made the change — to put the 
two point guards out there — 
is because we needed to be a 
better passing team to get the 
guys involved and the ball when 
they’re ready to shoot the ball,” 
Beilein said. “I watch them 
every day in practice, and we’re 
a pretty good shooting team, but 
we haven’t been able to do that 
in games. … Some of that is self-
inflicted. We get a little antsy 

and shoot a shot that looks open, 
but it’s really not.”

One 
of 
the 
most 
direct 

impacts 
of 

Albrecht’s 
insertion into 
the 
starting 

lineup 
was 

the play of 
sophomore 
forward 
Zak 
Irvin 

and 
junior 

guard 
Caris 

LeVert. After 
combining 
to shoot 4-for-20 — including 
2-for-12 in the first half — 
against the Boilermakers, the 
duo shot 12-for-17 against the 
Nittany Lions.

“I think we slowed the game 

down,” LeVert said. “Derrick 
and Spike did a great job of 
controlling the game out there, 
making it a lot easier for Zak 
and I. We took a lot easier 3s. 
And when the shot clock came, I 
think we got good shots.”

Though Albrecht and Walton 

have shared the floor often, 

whether it be early or in crunch 
time, the two had never played 
together from the tip.

While 

the pair’s 35 
points made 
up the bulk 
of Michigan’s 
scoring, 
another 
caveat 
of 

Albrecht 
starting 
was 
the 

pressure put 
on the bench 

to 
produce. 
Growing 

uncomfortable 
with 
his 

starters 
playing 
nearly 
the 

entire game, Beilein finally 
depended on his freshmen, like 
guards Muhammad-Ali Abdur-
Rahkman, Aubrey Dawkins and 
the now-benched Chatman, to 
produce.

And that’s exactly what the 

bench did, tallying 18 points, 
including four 3-pointers.

“One of the big things we’re 

not talking about was our bench 
was fantastic,” Beilein said. “We 

said, the freshmen, bring them 
off the bench. Let’s just play 
roles where you can do things. 
Kam comes over and hits two 
shots. Aubrey comes in and hits 
two shots. Ricky (Doyle) did a 
great job as a freshman.

“So it was a whole idea to get 

more rest. The bench is maybe 
more ready or we’re going to find 
out. But we can’t keep pressing 
these guys 37 minutes a game.”

With Albrecht’s focus as a 

starter to distribute, rather than 
score — he had six assists to lead 
the team — Walton was more 
relaxed, helping his scoring in 
the process.

“Just knowing I can back off 

and let him make some of the 
decisions, it kind of eases me 
a little bit,” Walton said. “Just 
knowing he’s capable of making 
the same plays I am — it kind of 
helps our play.”

Whether Albrecht stays in 

the starting lineup is still up in 
the air, but given the all-around 
results from Tuesday’s win, the 
simple solution might be here to 
stay.

‘M’ trims 19-point 

deficit to three, 
but falls short vs. 
Scarlet Knights

By MINH DOAN 

Daily Sports Writer

With 
10:45 
left 
in 
the 

game, sophomore guard Siera 
Thompson made a 3-pointer to 
tie the score for the Michigan 
women’s 
basketball 
team, 

which had trailed by as much 
as 19 in the first half.

But that was as close as the 

Wolverines (2-2 Big Ten, 10-5 
overall) would get. No. 24 
Rutgers (2-2, 11-4) scored the 
next seven points and never 
looked back en route to an 
81-68 victory Wednesday night 
at the Rutgers Athletic Center.

While the result remains 

a loss, the Wolverines played 
some of their best basketball 
against 
the 

reigning 
WNIT 
champion for 
10 
minutes 

in the second 
half.

Ending 

the first half 
down by 17 
points, 
the 

Wolverines 
needed 
to change up their tactics, 
specifically on defense.

“(In the) second half, we 

went exclusively zone,” said 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico. “We just tried to put a 
couple people inside the paint 
around their bigs and make 
them really have to score from 
the outside.”

And it worked, for a little 

while anyway.

The Wolverines came out of 

the halftime break with a 17-2 
run to cut the deficit to three 
points before trading baskets 
leading 
up 
to 
Thompson’s 

emphatic 3-pointer to tie the 
game.

But 
Michigan 
couldn’t 

come any closer to victory, 
and Rutgers closed out the 
game with a 12-2 run of its 
own to shut the door on the 

Wolverines’ upset hopes.

While 
the 
second 
half 

showed promise for Michigan, 
the first half showed the exact 
opposite.

With 15 turnovers in the 

first half, the Wolverines were 
unable to find rhythm with 
their offense, scoring just 25 
points on 42-percent shooting.

Coming off a win over 

Michigan State just three days 
before 
in 
which 
Michigan 

forced 
24 
turnovers, 
the 

Wolverines 
couldn’t 
stop 

the Scarlet Knights’ offense, 
especially in the first half.

“They scored pretty much 

all of their points in the paint, a 
lot of them off of our turnovers, 
in transition or their post 
players,” Barnes Arico said. 
“Their post players killed us in 
the first half.”

Freshman guard Katelynn 

Flaherty — the Wolverines’ 
leading scorer — returned to 
her home state of New Jersey, 
but it was anything but a warm 

homecoming.

Flaherty 

was 
held 

to just four 
points 
as 

the 
Scarlet 

Knights 
keyed in on 
her 
3-point 

shooting.

“They were 

face guarding 
her in the first 

half,” Barnes Arico said. “She 
made her first three, and then it 
was kind of hard for her to get 
touches.

“She’s got to get better. She’s 

got to learn how to use screens, 
how to get open, how to take 
advantage when people are 
overplaying and how to back 
cut.”

And Flaherty, along with 

the rest of the Wolverines, will 
have just four days to bounce 
back before they take on Ohio 
State at home in a big rivalry 
matchup.

But if there’s one thing 

Barnes Arico wants improved 
by then, it’s the defense.

“Rutgers, who doesn’t score a 

ton of points, scored 81 points,” 
Barnes Arico said. “So we have 
to figure out how to slow people 
down a little bit.”

SAM MOUSIGIAN/Daily

Siera Thompson scored 17 points in defeat against Rutgers on Wednesday.

“We have to 

figure out how 
to slow people 

down a little bit.”

In October, Nadya Tolokonnikova and Masha Alyokhina, two 

members of Pussy Riot, the punk rock protest group from Russia, 
took the stage of the Michigan Theater. The women did not don 
their neon balaclavas or break out in their provocative, political per-
formance art during their Thursday evening Penny Stamps lecture 
(though videos of their discordant demonstrations preceded the talk 
giving context to the issues and methods of resistance). The lecture 
took the form of an interview aided by a translator and touched upon 
the topics of freedom of speech, LGBTQ rights, Vladimir Putin, pris-
on reform and the role of art in the political realm. Nadya and Ma-
sha’s visit to Ann Arbor set the conversation on police brutality that 
colored the end of 2014. The two Pussy Riot members also met with 
the University’s Prison Creative Arts Project (PCAP) to learn about 
the penal system in the US and share their experiences of arrest and 
imprisonment in Russia. Students and community members lined up 
to ask questions, enthralled by the way in which Nadya and Masha 
have used their punk rock aesthetic and Guerilla Theater to broad-
cast their messages and capture the world stage. 

What will we talk about when we talk about “Birdman?” We will 

talk about Michael Keaton in the performance of a lifetime, balancing 
insanity and reality, confidence and reservation. We will talk about di-
rector Alejandro González Iñárritu and his masterful story, his sharp 
eye for detail, his carefully but brilliantly executed manipulation of 
setting, character and camerawork. We will talk about the gimmick: 
that the film appears as one, continuous tracking shot. And we will 
talk about the supporting cast, each role integral to the story, each 
character possessing a trait that illuminates a theme, a moral, a ques-
tion.

Because “Birdman” isn’t just about a washed-up actor giving it one 

more go; it’s about sanity, relevance, criticism, critics, theater, Hol-
lywood, fame, insecurity, method, staging, fatherhood, growing up, 
dreams, failure, comedy, tragedy, art itself. When we talk about “Bird-
man,” we will talk about what it is: pure, unadulterated creativity, the 
best, most rewarding motion picture in years. 

“Are you ready? Because I want you to pay attention. This is the be-

ginning of something.” -Freddy Rumsen

And a superb beginning it was. The first half of “Mad Men” ’s final 

season took unprecedented risks, exposing the fear and uncertainty of 
the late 1960s and using it to color seven episodes of character study. 
The ad execs we came to love over the past seven seasons began to 
lose their sway; the voices of old, rich white dudes faded to obsoles-
cence in the wake of changing racial and technological tides. With all 
the cultural turmoil, it’s no wonder the men of SC&P started to go 
a little mad. Some took LSD, some got a California tan; some cut off 
their nipples, put them in a box and gave them to a friend.

“Mad Men” is never predictable, but surely these seven episodes 

indicated the “beginning of something” – a gorgeous and compelling 
fall to the finale. 

Taylor Swift killed it in 2014. She moved from Nashville to New 

York, performed at the VMAs, openly embraced her feminist label and 
hosted an A-list birthday party. Somehow between all of that she man-
aged to drop the best-selling album of the year: her pop debut, 1989.

Taylor’s takeover of 2014 began with “Shake It Off,” a Swiftified-

back-off-haters pop anthem. Backed by saxophone, it had everyone 
(haters included) getting down to that sick beat for about two months 
straight. It held the charts over just long enough for the rest of 1989 to 
take them over. Each track runs on a different level, leaving listeners 
with a well-rounded, and completely satisfying pop experience. “Wel-
come to New York” demands to be played in Times Square at least 
once daily. The groove behind “Style” has a Bee Gee-esque beat and 
an unbelievably catchy chorus. “I Know Places” throws the hunter/
hunted metaphor through a loop producing one of the album’s most 
unique tracks. Lastly, there is not enough praise for “Blank Space” 
that speaks to its tongue-in-cheek awesomeness. Every track has a 
new angle; every track delivers.

What is more astonishing than the tracks themselves is the over-

all style of the album. It is masterful pop music without any of the 
bullshit that floods mainstream music. There’s no profanity, no molly 
references and it doesn’t make a spectacle out of itself by striving for 
shock or controversy. Even without shock, it still leaves listeners in 
awe.

1989 is groundbreaking by being regressive instead of progres-

sive. It is pop music at its core. It is about life and love and the battles 
people face within themselves every day. It is timeless. 1989 would’ve 
rocked it back in its title year, it is rocking it today and it will be rock-
ing it in 30 years.

2. “The Grand Budapest 

Hotel”

Wes Anderson’s “Grand Buda-

pest Hotel” is based loosely on 
Stefan Zweig’s novel “Beware of 
Pity,” where Zweig writes plain-
ly, “To the person who has over 
and over again tried to trace 
human destinies, many tell their 
own story.” This quote captures 
one of the film’s most essential 
beauties: the opening and clos-
ing of doors. Pages to dramas 
left half-open, entire stories left 
unconcluded, character motives 
and plot points left completely 
unhinged. “Grand Budapest” 
in its heart of hearts is a story 
about stories.

With hand-crafted sets, on-

location shooting, a script with 
relentless 
momentum, 
char-

acters touched by neuroses, 
strong historical time frames 
and 
his 
signature 
organic 

clockwork 
effect, 
Anderson 

spins “Grand Budapest” into a 
film of remarkable wit and can-
dor, one that daftly draws audi-
ences deeper into its fantastical 
realm. Films like these make 
the “barbaric slaughter-house 
known as humanity” a little 
more tolerable and a whole lot 
more inspiring.

 -BRIAN BURLAGE

3. “Gone Girl”

Gillian Flynn’s novel was 

one of the top-selling, most-
hyped, 
most-beloved-by-peo-

ple-named-Chloe books of the 
decade so far. Everybody and 
their mother (especially moms, 
though) has read “Gone Girl,” 
or at least has some familiar-
ity with the story. So what’s 
gained by a movie adaptation 
where most of the audience has 
already treaded every twist and 
turn and cracked the skulls of 
its impossible characters? A lot, 
actually. Director David Finch-
er wrung every drop of ten-
sion from the source material, 
dressing it in bleak realism and 

naturalistic acting. Rosamund 
Pike gave a career-defining per-
formance as Amy Dunne, the 
eponymous missing wife who’s a 
lot more complex than her diary 
entries imply. Ben Affleck was 
wonderfully inscrutable as Nick 
Dunne, conveying just the right 
combination of smarminess and 
scariness. (You also get to see 
Ben Affleck’s penis. Where was 
that in your novel, Ms. Flynn?) 
Even with the excitement sur-
rounding the book, “Gone Girl” 
proved that the film could stand 
as a darkly fascinating thriller of 
its own right. 

 -CHLOE GILKE

5. “Whiplash”

On some level, “Whiplash” is an 

exposé into the higher education 
rat-race and a cautionary tale about 
encouragement and goal-setting, 
but really, its moral sermons float 
on the periphery behind the crux 
of the film: pure, unadulterated 
drive. “Whiplash” strips away all 
wider contexts and invokes the 
same tunnel vision spawned by 
first-year music student Andrew’s 
zealous dedication to becoming 
one of jazz’s greats. The camera 
zooms in on the most immedi-
ate details of ambition: rivulets 

of sweat streaming down cheeks, 
bloody calluses hastily bandaged 
and subjected to more drumming, 
more friction. It’s all about fric-
tion, this film; it’s as physical as 
it is emotional and the genius is 
that it drags the viewer into the 
fray. When the visceral imagery, 
emotional anguish, and drum-
beat’s tempo accelerates, so does 
the tension you feel, heart pump-
ing faster and faster alongside the 
screen until you, like Andrew, are 
left gasping for breath.

Best Performances of 2014

1. Cabaret

In mid-October, SMTD per-

formed “Cabaret,” an award-
winning 
musical 
from 
the 

1960s, for their fall production. 
“Cabaret” tells the story of the 
performers and patrons of the 
Kit Kat Club, a nightclub in 
Weimar Republic, Berlin just 
before the Nazi rise to power. 
Director and visiting profes-
sor Joe Locarro added sev-
eral touches to make SMTD’s 
version of the show unique. 
First, they transformed the 

Lydia Mendelssohn Theatre 
into an old-fashioned cabaret 
by building the stage over the 
orchestra pit and placing the 
band onstage. Second, Locarro 
added six new characters to 
the show to perform some his-
torically accurate songs before 
the musical began to allow the 
audience to feel as though they 
really had been transported 
back in time.

3. Sea Legs: 

A Nautical New Musical

At the end of February, Basement 

Arts, a student-run theatre organi-
zation that provides free produc-
tions to the Ann Arbor community, 
staged a new student written and 
student composed musical called 
“Sea Legs: A Nautical New Musi-
cal.” The show, which was written 
by graduate Tyler Dean and com-
posed by Wayne State University 
graduate Michael Tooman, tells 
the story of four friends who live 
in the quaint New England seaside 
village of Sweet Ann Harbor and 
dream of adventure. Their dreams 
come true in a big way when the 

quirky residents of Periscopia, an 
underwater utopia, wash up on 
their shores, determined to find 
the person responsible for sinking 
their underwater haven. The show 
was Dean’s love letter to Ann Arbor 
as his graduation approached and 
he was set to enter the real world. 
“Sea Legs” had an off-Broadway 
run in September thanks to The 
Araca Project, which helps recent 
graduates from several universities, 
including the University of Michi-
gan, get a jump start in their careers 
by putting on their work.

4. Doing White Nights

While the number of student 

productions that are conceived and 
performed in the Ann Arbor com-
munity continue to grow, it’s still 
relatively rare for a performance to 
be entirely student organized and 
executed. Many things account for 
this, school being an enormous and 
obvious factor, yet “Doing White 
Nights,” a completely student-run 
original play, was able to pull off 
three consecutive nights of fan-

tastic drama and humor while the 
participants juggled school and 
other extra-curriculars. A story 
of two best friends on a road trip 
gone sour, the play explored the 
themes of mental illness, sexual-
ity and belonging in a tasteful and 
touching way, all while utilizing 
the uniqueness of the venue, The 
Yellow Barn, to create the central 
setting of an off-road cornfield.

Ryoji Ikeda

Born in Japan and working 

primarily out of Paris, Ryoji 
Ikeda 
is 
an 
internationally 

acclaimed visual and electron-
ic musical artist whose work 
forges a bold and thoughtful 
connection between ideas and 
theories from quantum mechan-
ics, experimental modes of visu-
al representation, and principles 
of classical composition. In 
November, he brought his most 
recent project, superposition, to 
the Power Center. In a live set-

ting, his aesthetic pioneering 
translates into an austere, beau-
tiful and immersive experience 
at the limits of sight and hear-
ing. One of the great interests 
of Ikeda’s work lies in his ability 
to craft tensions and resolutions 
gleaned from the likes of Bach 
but brought into a register of 
sonic and visual harshness that 
challenges the artistic vocabu-
lary many audiences bring to 
the table.

4. “Boyhood”

Filmed over 12 consecu-

tive years, director Richard 
Linklater’s epic masterpiece 
“Boyhood” bucks tradition by 
including an aspect of life that 
Hollywood so often neglects — 
reality. The film has redefined 
the genre of coming-of-age 
through the vivid illustra-
tion of Mason and the flow-
ing authenticity of his life. 
Though the film is centered 
on Mason, the gradual aging of 
his divorced father and moth-
er, played by Ethan Hawke and 

Patricia Arquette, is a testimo-
nial to the struggles of modern 
parents. With genuine cultural 
milestones of the ‘90s and early 
2000s, 
Linklater 
gracefully 

welcomes the beautiful and 
fleeting experience of time. It 
is the simplicity of the story of 
“Boyhood” that casts a spell 
over its audience. There are no 
dramatic twists or gimmicks, 
only the loveliness of an ordi-
nary life coexisting with its 
ticking clock.

Best Singles of 2014
4. “i”

Kendrick Lamar

When 
I 
heard 
the 
Isley 

Brother’s sample at the begin-
ning of Kendrick Lamar’s “i,” it 
was immediately clear that the 
Compton rapper had created 
something special in the TDE 
laboratory. With a smooth retro 
guitar track, and a peppier beat 
than a typical Kendrick song, “i” 
stands out in the Lamar antholo-
gy. The song divided fans – mak-
ing some nostalgic for his older, 

darker material. But Kendrick 
isn’t looking to simply replicate 
his old work – “i” marks the 
beginning of a new, more socially 
meditative chapter for the writer. 
“i” delivered both in terms of 
lyrical substance and musical 
quality, while paying homage to 
Lamar’s musical forefathers. I 
can’t wait to see what Kendrick 
does next in 2015.

5. “Red Eyes”

The War on Drugs

Few lines in The War on 

Drugs’s outstanding single “Red 
Eyes” register audibly. While 
this mumbling bumbling tactic 
is, so often in the world of rock, 
aligned with a too-cool-to-care 
persona among most larger-
than-life musicians, in Adam 
Granduciel’s case it isn’t. He’s 
endured as much heartbreak 
and bitter love as any these last 
couple years, but instead of sing-
ing loudly and proudly to beat 
the bad emotions away, he seems 
to do the exact opposite: these 
emotions, experiences and senti-
ments are as much a part of him 
as the Neil Young-type reso-
nance in his voice. When he sings 
phrases like “To beat it down 

/ To get to my soul” that ring 
clear as a bell through a thick 
haze, he sings them not to dem-
onstrate strength, not to outline 
any plan for healing, but rather, 
as a self-centering mantra. “Red 
Eyes” is rock music’s latest and 
greatest testament to what the 
Japanese call jishin, which is the 
synchronizing of one’s energy 
with belief. This song describes 
one of the greatest emotions of 
all, one we’ve all felt and one we 
hope to feel again: understand-
ing. And when Granduciel belts 
a “whoo!” before returning to his 
guitar-meditation, we know his 
understanding is absolutely a cel-
ebration.

-BRIAN BURLAGE

1. “Blank Space”

Taylor Swift

2014 was undeniably the 

year of Taylor Swift. Saying 
1989 was a huge success is an 
understatement, largely due 
to the popularity of “Blank 
Space.” The song drives along 
with a ringing yet punctuated 
backbeat, while the lyrics, and 
awesome music video, per-
fectly capture and challenge 
the media perception of Swift’s 
“serial dater” persona. It is, on 
one level, entirely honest and 

real, and, on another, a per-
fect, fun pop song. After listen-
ing the first time, it is almost 
impossible to resist putting it 
on repeat. The combination of 
an infectious overall sound and 
unforgettable lyrical blurbs, 
like “Darling I’m a nightmare 
dressed 
like 
a 
daydream,” 

make “Blank Space” the jam of 
2014.

 -CARLY SNIDER

2. “Chandelier”

Sia

After all the writing invested 

in other artists, it’s only fair that 
Sia saves the cream of the crop 
for her own record. But what a 
shame it is that one of the year’s 
most hypnotic power ballads 
is also the year’s biggest lyrical 
buzzkill. In combination with 
an eerie modality and hover-
ing electronica, Sia’s seemingly 
fatigued vocals fittingly narrate 
the self-destructive repetitions 
of a broken spirit. “Party girls 

don’t get hurt, can’t feel a thing, 
when will I learn? / I push it 
down, push it down.” And while 
the track’s “1, 2, 3, drink” pre-
chorus hook is enticing on its 
surface, it’s a cry for help further 
below. Perhaps the only fault of 
“Chandelier” is that its repeti-
tion, heavy synth and rhythmic 
hip-hop production transform it 
into a jam-track worthy of over-
seeing its pointed lyrical core.

the 

blood of an Irishman? That’s 
just 
the 
brooding 
Hozier 

lamenting the self-deprecating 
power of his love all over the 
Billboard charts. Once every 
year or so, if we’re lucky, a 
really unexpected, pure and 
truly musical song sashays its 
way into the pop music atmo-
sphere. It not only is critically 
adored; it’s played on almost 
every radio station, sung in the 
shower, on “The Voice,” in a 
Beats By Dre commercial. It’s 
a marvelous feat, maximum 
exposure, an accomplishment 
for the music industry and a 
testimony to the sheer beauty 
of the song.

This 
all 
happened 
most 

charmingly in 2014 with “Take 
Me to Church,” Andrew Hozi-
er-Byrne’s eerie, metaphori-

cal, somber and passionate 
religious ballad. Not only are 
the lyrics literal poetry (“If 
I’m a pagan of the good times, 
my lover’s the sunlight / to 
keep the Goddess on my side 
/ she demands a sacrifice”), 
but Hozier’s voice is absolute-
ly irresistible. Sonorous and 
pleading, he cries out the lyrics 
with more passion than most of 
his contemporaries. The song 
is both sexy and sad, loving and 
masochistic — but above all, 
it’s surprisingly catchy. Right-
fully nominated for a Song of 
the Year Grammy, Hozier had 
an extraordinary year marked 
with a rapid ascension to fame. 
We can only hope this rookie is 
here to say, for the sake of ears, 
hearts, poets and minds every-
where. Amen.

2. Rocky Horror Shadowcast

Deep in the heart of East Quad 

on Halloween night, hundreds 
of students gathered outside the 
doors of the Keene Theater, hop-
ing to see the first Rocky Hor-
ror Shadowcast in Ann Arbor in 
years. Since its release in 1973, 
“Rocky Horror Picture Show,” 
a musical, has emerged as a 
hyper-sexualized, melodramatic, 
indescribably weird cult clas-
sic. In some circles, it’s become a 
Halloween tradition to perform 
the show via shadowcast – lip-
synching the dialogue and lyr-
ics in front of a screen projecting 

the original film, starring Tim 
Curry and Susan Sarandon. The 
RC Players, a student-run theater 
group known for their bi-annual 
Evening of Scenes and Kami-
kaze (24 hour theater), tackled 
the show, complete with Rocky 
Horror traditions like audience 
participation, low budget hilar-
ity, obscure props, and, of course, 
the “ceremonial virgin sacrifice.” 
Don’t know what I’m talking 
about? See the show next fall. Just 
get there early. This past produc-
tion was standing-room only.

For someone who seemed 

nothing more than a one-hit 
wonder plastered on a series of 
lucky hits, Sam Smith has risen 
to the ranks of the some of the 
world’s most consistent artists. 
With that, it’s hard to believe 
that In the Lonely Hour is only 
Smith’s debut.

Smith 
is 
technical, 
but 

doesn’t let that get in the way 
of raw emotion. He’s dramat-
ic, but earnest. His lyrics are 
relatable, each packaged in a 
painfully 
honest 
storybook 

form. In some ways, it’s repeti-
tive, really. In The Lonely Hour 
tells the same perplexity of 
unrequited love in 10 differ-
ent colors through each of his 
tracks.

Mustering 
three 
top 
10 

tracks in the United States and 
six whooping Grammy nomina-
tions this year alone, Smith has 
broken through the realm of 
contemporary adult pop, bring-
ing the voice of contemporary-
classics in the likes of Michael 
Bublé and Adele back into 
mainstream media. While each 
track narrates love’s down-

falls and the ultimate triumphs 
of heartbreak, Smith’s voice 
tells another story of strain 
and mental ache. Through his 
music, Smith acquiesces to 
his fate, and tells his story in 
stream-of-consciousness fash-
ion, replicating the exactness 
of every sting and stitch he felt 
through his experiences.

In some ways, it’s incredu-

lous to imagine Smith’s sound 
being anything other than mel-
ancholic. But for someone who 
knows his sound impeccably 
well — more than most other 
artists in his genre, at least — 
it’s hard to imagine him saying 
he conceived making a Rihan-
na-esque record in mid-May 
when he didn’t believe he had 
the vocal timbre to pull it off.

In The Lonely Hour is per-

fect. It conjoins single-worthy 
melodies with a voice that truly 
knows how to capture emotion. 
Yet, when perfection repeats 
itself, it no longer is per-
fect. Show us something else 
extraordinary, Smith. That’s 
how you’ll stay.

Despite 
being 
one-word 

short of being mute, Groot 
grows into the hearts of any-
one who enjoyed “Guardians 
of the Galaxy.” But it may sur-
prise some that Groot made the 
list because (1) Groot predomi-
nately plays a supporting role 
and (2) Groot (mostly) doesn’t 
make his own decisions. But 
Groot’s general lack of volition 
contributes to his childlike 
innocence, which makes him 
more easily lovable.

Groot is also super fuckin’ 

cool because (SPOILER) Groot 
totally sacrifices himself for 
the group by transforming into 
a protective cocoon and saving 
the Guardians from destruc-
tion. Kudos to Vin Diesel on 
his 
masterful 
voice 
acting 

and probably being the least 
-expected actor to voice one 
of the best characters. We are

Ralph Fiennes, best known 

to our generation for portray-
ing Lord Voldemort, turned in 
one of the finest performances 
of 2014 in “The Grand Buda-
pest Hotel.” A concierge of the 
titular hotel, Monsieur Gus-
tave H. reveals very little about 
himself, entrancing audiences 
simply by oozing charisma. He 
operates in the perpetual pres-

ent, living every moment of his 
life with more gusto than most 
do on their wedding day, which 
explains why, though he’s often 
drawl and sometimes conde-
scending, Gustave H. endears 
audiences: he appreciates the 
simple treasures life has to 
offer, like interesting company 
or a good lay.

Terence 
Fletcher 
is 
the 

teacher you think hates you, 
and you know what? Maybe he 
does. He taunts the musicians 
in his prestigious jazz band into 
submission, ruthlessly preying 
on their insecurities until tal-
ent arises out of pure, cold fear. 
Once he wrings every last fiber 
out of his students’ beings, he 
cruelly demands more, physi-
cally and emotionally draining 
them to the point where tough-

love motivation distorts into a 
deadly breed of self-inflicted 
torture. He admits to genu-
inely supporting his students, 
but where should the line be 
drawn between motivation and 
abuse? You don’t know, and you 
never will, because all you are 
is a worthless pansy ass who 
cries like a whiny nine-year old 
girl and Terence Fletcher will 
always be one step ahead of you.

ASYLUM

Since the rise of Icona Pop’s “I 

Love It,” Charlotte Aitchison has 
been hopping from track to track 
on fellow artists’ radio hits, and 
in the final chapter of 2014, Charli 
XCX brought about a glitz-and-
glam pop-punk record that seam-
lessly weaves its aggressions into 
the threads of its live-like-crazy 
preachings.

And while the heightened real-

ity of Aitchison’s “London Queen” 
lifestyle can appear out of touch 

at times, the pop singer’s Gwen-
Stefani-esque cheerleader chants 
will pull anyone along for the ride 
— even if on the “wrong side of the 
road.”

Sucker growls in the face of 

every female power-pop singer of 
2014, and has the sonic distortion 
and lyrical brutality to back up its 
third degree heat.

Don’t end up being the guy on 

the other end of a Charli XCX lyric.

-GREG HICKS

Charli XCX

In 1988, a group from Long 

Island called Public Enemy 
released It Takes a Nation 
of Millions to Hold Us Back. 
Though the album can be cat-
egorized as early hip hop, it’s 
more of a study in noise rap, 
and it synthesized various ele-
ments of rock, punk and jazz 
into a single mortar shell that 
shattered the history of street 
music and street politics.

In 2014, El-P and Killer 

Mike, one of hip hop’s new-
est and most overlooked duos, 
produced an idealized fusion of 
Public Enemy’s noise art with 
Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth’s 
symbiotic rap. The result is 
RTJ2, a work born of fire and 
brimstone, one that channels 
anger and confusion into red-
hot chrysalises, one that teems 
with vitality and bursts with 
napalm. Killer Mike and El-P 
take their burning fury and 
shape it into verse that hits 
the jugular again and again. 
In the opener “Jeopardy,” the 
duo spares no blow: “I spit 
with the diction of Malcolm or 
say a Bun B / Prevail through 
Hell, so Satan get thee behind 
me,” Mike sings at the end 
of his verse. El-P adds to the 

attack, “I live to spit on your 
grave, my existence is to dis-
grace you / The kitten became 
a lion that looks to your face 
like great food.” All 39 minutes 
run something like this. Two 
talented, middle-aged rappers 
harmonizing one perfect ver-
bal assault after the other.

Above all, these are sturdy 

songs with highly intelligent 
production beats, bars and 
brushstrokes. Take, for exam-
ple, the subtle but devastating 
internal rhyme scheme Killer 
Mike delivers in “Blockbuster 
Night Part 1”: “I Jake the Snake 
‘em, DDT ‘em in mausoleums 
/ Macabre massacres killing 
cunts in my coliseum.” Like the 
album as a whole, these two 
lines seamlessly perpetuate the 
collective momentum while 
also polishing the interior like 
clockwork. Even the structure 
of RTJ2 achieves harmony, as 
the second side injects some 
air into a first side consumed 
with gunsmoke. It’s this kind 
of precision that makes RTJ2 
an album of staggering energy, 
one that doesn’t join the ranks 
of history so much as it does 
break them to bits.

5. The Pinkprint

Nicki Minaj

In a year where most of hip 

hop’s major stars did not release 
an album, The Pinkprint stands 
practically alone as a sprawling 
classic filled with emotion, experi-
mentation and pure talent. On her 
third album, Nicki Minaj mixes 
deeply personal lyrics befitting of 
a classic break-up album with the 
more familiar unhinged hip-hop 
swagger that made her a star. She 
forms a perfect dream trio with 
Beyoncé and Hit-Boy on “Feel-
ing Myself” — a bouncy, focused 

burst of energy that was one of the 
most exciting songs of the year — 
and she brings out a surprising, 
beautiful singing voice on tracks 
like “Pills N Potions” and “Grand 
Piano.” On top of that, The Pink-
print spotlights the unpredictable, 
maniac Minaj on “Anaconda,” a 
song that was part novelty, sure, 
but also a subversive, empowering 
party-starter. How many break-up 
records proudly declare, “I got a 
big fat ass?”

In 
“Birdman,” 
Michael 

Keaton walks the fragile line of 
reality playing both washed-
up actor Riggan Thomson and 
Birdman, the haunting alter 
ego that stems from his super-
hero movie past. Thomson 
attempts to both revive his 
dying career in a Broadway 
play and deal with his broken 
family, alcoholic actors and 
his apparent nosedive into 
mental illness. The single-shot 
cinematography of the film 

exposes all of the flaws and 
anxieties of a man desperately 
trying to prove his relevance 
in a world of tweets and blogs 
that he can’t even understand. 
Keaton conveys the nuances of 
Thomson’s insecurities with 
ironic accuracy, as he himself 
has been cast off as a depleted 
source of talent. Keaton plays 
Thomson brilliantly, forcing 
the audience to accept that 
this Birdman might really fly.

Who is Amy Dunne? For the 

first half of “Gone Girl,” we’re 
really not sure. It’s kind of 
funny that our favorite char-
acter of the year is missing for 
a large portion of her movie; 
she is “Gone,” after all. That 
being said, Amy is certainly no 
damsel in distress. She’s the 
coolest, most intriguing and 
by far the scariest character of 

2014. Via a slow-burn patch-
work of flashbacks and reveals 
that only David Fincher could 
make happen onscreen, we 
begin to learn the complex 
story of who Amy is and why 
she disappeared. Uncovering 
her secrets was one of the best 
experiences film had to offer 
this year.

2. The Good Wife

CBS

“The Good Wife” continued 

to blow away audiences in 2014, 
from the tail end of season five 
to its season six mid-season 
finale. With razor-sharp writ-
ing and a newly-trained focus on 
character, Michele and Robert 
King’s legal and political drama 
proved that Will’s death was a 
springboard into new narrative 
heights. Its brilliance showed, 
sweeping up a bevy of awards at 
the Emmys and Golden Globes.

Season six saw Alicia move out 

of her grieving funk and make 

the decision to run for State 
Attorney (plus a Gloria Steinem 
cameo!). Cary’s long criminal 
trial heartbreakingly unfolded; 
and after the January premiere, 
viewers will have only a hand-
ful of episodes to savor Kalinda 
before she departs. Indeed, the 
writers’ treatment of Kalinda 
has been the weakest part of 
the show as of late, but if Will’s 
departure has shown anything, 
“The Good Wife” is a constantly 
evolving and flexible show.

3. Orange is the New Black

Netflix once again succeeds 

in dominating our lives. For 13 
straight hours of our summer, we 
became introverts, never peeling 
our eyes from the screen, captivat-
ed by “Orange is the New Black”’s 
sophomore season.

The series brings a stigma-

tized, condemned community of 
convicts to the forefront – illumi-
nating a complexity and human-
ity behind their crimes. The show 
teaches us to be empathetic, and 
gives 
insight 
into 
characters 

behind the superficial. It forces us 
to be introspective, and demands 
that we analyze the human condi-
tion as well as the despicable, yet 

neglected, failures of institution-
alization. In the second season, 
creator Jenji Kohan shifts the 
show’s narrative attention to indi-
viduality, an aspect that makes the 
show relatable despite its uncon-
ventional characters. The charac-
ter development is fluid, and the 
season focuses on portraying the 
multi-dimensionality in not only 
Piper, but in the secondary and 
tertiary characters, too.

“Orange is the New Black” is 

progressive, emotional, enlight-
ening – and certainly one of the 
best television programs of the 
past year.

-KAREN HUA

4. Game of Thrones

Consistent oversight by the 

Emmys isn’t hurting the ascen-
sion of “Game of Thrones” into a 
pop-culture phenomenon. This 
past season included some of the 
series’ strongest moments and 
maintained an average viewer-
ship of 18.6 million across all plat-
forms.

The show continues to chart 

new territory in the realm of genre 
and television. Despite living in 
a world populated by dragons, 
“Game of Thrones” ’s characters 

ditch clichés in favor of astute 
psychological realism. The visu-
als, from the effects to the cinema-
tography, rival the vast majority of 
big-budget blockbusters. In every 
frame, an inescapable feeling of 
unease and dread plays the nerves 
of the audience like a fiddle.

The multi-cultural, multi-tal-

ented cast and crew have rendered 
one of the finest screen adapta-
tions of a source material in recent 
memory.

-DREW MARON

5. True Detective

In an industry flooded with 

crime shows and bound by yel-
low caution tape, it takes a certain 
ingenuity to make a whodunit 
series stand out. First, it needs 
a brilliant storyteller to weave 
in the twisting plots that we 
crave, someone like novelist-
turned-screenwriter Nic Pizzo-
latto. Then add two Hollywood 
big-shots with a penchant for 
darker projects, like Matthew 
McConaughey and Woody Har-
relson. The result is “True Detec-
tive,” 
HBO’s 
groundbreaking 

series that follows detectives Rust 

(McConaughey) and Marty (Har-
relson) in their search for a serial 
killer with a fetish for sacrificing 
women in the willowy plains of 
Louisiana.

What 
differentiates 
“True 

Detective” from other crime 
shows is not its frontrunners’ 
edgy chemistry. It’s because it has 
an expiration date. Each season 
brings a different cast and story. 
Season two, airing this summer, 
will feature Colin Farrell, Vince 
Vaughn and Rachel McAdams, 
and will be set in California.

gather in Espresso Royale on 
State Street for free donuts, 
free coffee and free electrical 
outlets. There for a minute or 
the full 10 hours, participants 

work on their writing – often 
on manual typewriters – and 
meticulously craft their pieces: 
from formless poems to dia-
logue-heavy short stories to 
the first paragraphs of novels 
that will be deleted as soon as 
they’re finished. It’s about the 
process, after all, not the prod-
uct. The event isn’t high bud-
get, and it isn’t fast-paced; well,

ing her accomplishments down 
to earth for her audience. She 
discussed her early years in 
Paris studying architecture, 
and how her desire to be more 
involved in the final product 
of her work led her to move 
to New York and pursue print 

making. She encountered a 
comic artist, Art Spiegelman, 
whom she would later marry 
and work with. The couple 
made their first New Yorker 
cover together, which led to 
her employment and eventu-
ally to her role as Art Director.

Best Viral Videos of 2014

1. Too Many Cooks

A video created for “Adult 

Swim” titled “Too Many Cooks” 
was released in October as a par-
ody of classic sitcoms. It begins 
by recreating the opening titles 
of many familiar sitcoms from 
the ‘80s and ‘90s. However, it 
doesn’t stop after one cast of 
characters is introduced, but 
continues to introduce more, 
with each set’s introductions 
growing more ridiculous. The 
parody consists of many stock 
characters, including a puppet 
and a slasher villain, mocking 

the over-the-top acting that the 
era is notorious for. Watching 
the video derail from family-
friendly to plain bizarre was 
like watching a car crash: we 
couldn’t look away and neither 
could the rest of the world.

The video went viral and even 

received a Twitter shout out 
from Zach Braff (“Scrubs”). It 
left us with a theme song stuck 
in our heads, with more ques-
tions than answers and a strange 
feeling of nostalgia.

2. Jimmy Fallon’s lip sync 
battle with Emma Stone

The setup of a lip sync battle is 

simple: there are two competitors, 
one stage, one mic. In a “Tonight 
Show” lip sync battle, whoever 
can upstage Jimmy Fallon is the 
winner – a feat in and of itself. 
While promoting “The Amazing 
Spider Man 2,” Emma Stone was 
invited to the superhero-sized 
challenge of battling Fallon off 
the stage. Fallon stepped to the 
mic first, breaking out a gyrating 
version of “Fancy” by Iggy. Stone 
wasn’t fazed though, and as the 
determined diva that she is, she 

ripped out a deadpan rendering of 
“Hook” by Blues Traveler. In clas-
sic Fallon fashion, he retaliated 
with a hilariously theatrical “Mr. 
Roboto” by Styx.

But Stone kicked in for the 

win, syncing “All I Do Is Win” by 
DJ Khaled, with a performance 
so head-bangingly intense that 
her lyrical accuracy was unques-
tioned. Fallon was brought to his 
knees in laughter and awe under 
the power of Emma Stone, as was 
the rest of the nation.

3. The “Apparently” Kid

Give him a few years and 

English teachers will be lay-
ing into Noah Ritter (i.e. The 
“Apparently” Kid) for his repet-
itive lexicon. In 2014, though, 
18 million plus viewers became 
so enamored with the five-
year-old that he made the req-
uisite pit stops for all internet 
sensations: “The Ellen Show” 
and “The Colbert Report.” Rit-
ter gained viral status when a 
local news station interviewed 
him at a county fair – a natu-
ral logorrheic, Ritter managed 

to use the word ‘apparently’ 
many, many times (probably 
not worth counting) in a min-
ute-and-a-half clip. His act was 
equal parts neurotic crank and 
precocious tot, and it enamored 
America. Later down the fame 
road, he even got to chat with 
Sofia Vergara (“Modern Fam-
ily”), but declined a kiss from 
her, no doubt leaving the collec-
tive Internet – male and female 
– scratching its head.

4. Mile-high performance 

of “The Lion King”

A video posted to YouTube 

on April 1st captured the profes-
sional cast of “The Lion King” 
singing “The Circle of Life” on 
an airplane about to leave Bris-
bane for Sydney. The pure talent 
alone is enough to merit a spot on 
our list – “The Circle of Life” is 
one of the most difficult songs to 
pull off a capella, let alone when 
the singers are sitting squished 
between other passengers and 
scattered throughout the plane, 
making for less than optimal 
acoustics. But the act is just as 

fun to watch as it is to listen to 
– the passenger reactions, find-
ing themselves in the middle of a 
real life, “Glee”-like occurrence, 
are hilarious. Some enjoy the 
impromptu performance, taking 
their own grainy iPhone videos; 
others are simply bemused, and 
the last third of the passengers 
sit stony-faced and unamused 
throughout the whole thing – 
perhaps determined not to let 
Disney on Broadway’s cast hijack 
their April Fool’s Day.

5. Strangers 
kiss for the 
first time

Last fall, WREN and Tatia 

Pilieva produced a short film for 
a social experiment that asked 
20 strangers to kiss for the first 
time. Under the lights, before a 
white backdrop and in front of 
multiple cameras – the subjects 
introduced themselves briefly, 
then gradually moved toward a 
very intimate act of connection.

Though the couples were 

quite cognizant of the initial 
awkwardness, they soon let 

themselves go – they allowed 
their innate human vulnerabili-
ties to emerge. Once kissing, it 
was as if the cameras and pro-
duction crew disappeared – and 
the tenderness and passion of 
human attraction overpowered 
all else. This was no typical 
meet-and-greet hook-up, but it 
showcased a simple, beautiful 
bond humans may have with 
any other human.

In addition, the video show-

cased diversity, a silent com-
mentary on how connection can 
merge 
demographic 
barriers. 

The experiment included both 
homo and heterosexual couples, 
both the young and elderly and 
various cultural backgrounds. 
This opened up a fruitful discus-
