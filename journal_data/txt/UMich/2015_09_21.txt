Fiorina, Paul urge 

Republicans to 
re-examine party 

identity

By SHOHAM GEVA

Daily News Editor

Their platforms were differ-

ent, but the Saturday speeches 
of 
former 
Hewlett-Packard 

CEO Carly Fiorina and Sen. 
Rand Paul (R–Ky.), both Repub-
lican presidential candidates, 
at the Mackinac Republican 
Leadership Conference both 
urged the GOP to examine its 

identity as a party.

Fiorina, who spoke first, told 

the crowd that the GOP needs 
to reintroduce itself.

“It’s amazing to me how 

many people don’t know, for 
example, that ours is the party 
of women’s suffrage,” she said. 
“The reason I say we have to 
reintroduce ourselves to the 
American people is because this 
is a fight about many things, but 
it’s mostly about, in 2016, what 
do we really believe about the 
potential of the American peo-
ple? What do we really believe 
about each and every American 
and what they’re capable of?”

She said that idea of potential

Presidential 

contenders advocate 
culture shift in D.C.

MACKINAC ISLAND — As 

the Michigan Republican Lead-
ership Conference began this 
weekend, the platforms among 
the first half of the five GOP 
presidential candidates slated to 
speak varied, but the narrative 
stuck to similar themes.

Former 
Florida 
Gov. 
Jeb 

Bush kicked off the conference’s 
keynote 
speakers, 
delivering 

remarks Friday evening. He was 
followed Saturday afternoon by 
Ohio Gov. John Kasich and U.S. 
Sen. Ted Cruz (R–Texas).

Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker 

was scheduled to speak Satur-
day morning until his flight to 
the island was cancelled due to 
inclement weather.

All three cited the need to 

change culture — through posi-
tivity, bipartisan cooperation and 
a return to Constitutional values 
— whether on the campaign trail, 
in Washington D.C. or in both.

In introducing Bush, GOP 

activist Peter Secchia said the 
party’s focus should be on look-
ing forward.

“I know there are some people 

that say Jeb’s got a problem,” he 
said. “And we don’t have a candi-
date who doesn’t have a problem. 
But you know what? I don’t want 
to worry about our internal prob-
lems. I want to beat a Clinton.”

Speaking before Cruz on Sat-

urday, State Sen. Phil Pavlov (R–
St. Clair Township) highlighted 
Cruz’s background as someone 
who would challenge the status 
quo in Washington.

“This is not a time for politics 

as usual,” he said. “Enough is 
enough of politics as usual.”

Bush told the gathered crowd 

Friday evening that above all, he 
wants to run a campaign that’s 
different — echoing his oft-
repeated focus of changing the 

culture by running with opti-
mism.

That kind of approach, he said, 

could expand the electoral map 
for Republicans.

“The way I try to describe it is 

we run a campaign with our arms 
open, with a hopeful, optimistic 
message,” he said. “We don’t run 
a campaign looking down at peo-
ple and saying how bad things 
are, with an angry voice.”

Though Republicans current-

ly control the governor’s office 
and legislature in Michigan, the 
state has not voted for the party 
in a presidential election since 
1988.

Michigan downs 
UNLV, 28-7, in 
blowout victory

Wolverines win 

their second 
straight game

By ZACH SHAW

Daily Sports Editor

When a would-be sack by 

Michigan redshirt junior defen-
sive tackle Matt Godin turned 
into a 16-yard scramble, it looked 
like the upset-minded UNLV 
football team had brought some 
luck with it from Las Vegas.

But through its stifling defense 

and uncharacteristically explo-
sive offense, the Wolverines (2-1) 
ensured the Rebels’ luck stopped 
there, using 254 yards of rushing 
and two takeaways to power past 
UNLV en route to a 28-7 win.

It didn’t take long for Michi-

gan to rebound after Godin 
brought 
UNLV 
quarterback 

Blake Decker down, but never to 
the ground. Junior cornerback 
Channing Stribling snagged his 
first-career interception on the 
very next play, setting up a four-
yard touchdown pass from fifth-
year senior quarterback Jake 
Rudock to junior running back 

De’Veon Smith.

Though Rudock struggled for 

much of the game, completing 
just 14 of 22 passes and throw-
ing his fifth interception of the 
season, he kept drives going with 
short passes and the occasional 
scramble.

“It’s fair to say the timing is off 

(in the passing game),” Chesson 
said. “Right now, we don’t com-
plete the plays, but in practice it 
is there. It’s just a level of consis-
tency that we need to bring to the 
games.”

More importantly, though, the 

players Rudock handed the ball 
off to were ready to carry the 
load.

Smith, who set a career high 

with 126 rushing yards last week, 
struggled with just 33 yards on 
13 carries. But just a few minutes 
after his receiving touchdown, 
Chesson took an end-around 36 
yards to the house.

It was Michigan’s longest play 

of the season, but that title didn’t 
last long. With 7:30 to go in the 
first half, junior Ty Isaac broke 
the game open, hitting the jack-
pot on a 76-yard run.

The run was his first score for

University nursing students 

and faculty gathered outside 
their new $50 million facil-
ity late Friday morning for a 

ribbon-cutting ceremony to 
celebrate the accomplishments 
and

Two campus 

exhibits feature 

famous Detroit art 

installation

BY JACKIE CHARNIGA

Daily Staff Reporter

DETROIT 
— 
On 
Sunday, 

Detroit native Tyree Guyton, 
creator of the open-air Heidel-
berg Project, stood next to a sev-
ered Barbie doll limb poking out 
of the dirt from a lot on Detroit’s 
east side.

University 
students 
and 

Detroit residents gathered on 
Heidelberg Street to complete 
maintenance on a house that is 
part of the Heidelberg Project art 
installation. The volunteers were 
participating in a new initiative 
aiming to create a relationship 
between the University and the 
famous project.

Guyton said he was decon-

structing and rebranding one of 
his Heidelberg houses, and the 
Barbie limb was one of his “jew-
els.”

“You see that leg there? That’s 

magic. I’m teaching people how 
to see,” Guyton said. “That’s 
gonna go on this house.”

Guyton and his grandfather 

started the Heidelberg Project in 
1986 by gathering local materials 
for an art installation. He said his 
project goes beyond the city of 
Detroit.

“Albert Einstein said that logic 

would take you from point A to 
point B, imagination would take 
you everywhere,” Guyton said. 
“What I’m doing here is I’m cre-
ating an art in such a way that it 
goes beyond.”

LSA senior Rachel Johnston, 

the student liaison between the 
University and the Heidelberg 
Project, said her father’s involve-
ment in the project inspired her 
to participate. Johnston said her 
father started helping out at the 
project in 2013, after a few of 

the installation’s houses were 
burned down.

After her father started tak-

ing regular trips to Detroit, 
Johnston became more closely 
involved.

“I just started tagging along 

with him,” she said. “The first 
time I met Tyree he already 
knew everything about me. I 
was like, “Oh my god I have to 
keep coming back now, this is so 
cool.’”

Currently, there are two Hei-

delberg exhibits on campus 
— one at the University of Michi-
gan Museum of Art and one on 
the ground floor of Haven Hall. 
Johnston said she increased her 
excursions to Detroit to help 
Guyton prepare to bring Heidel-
berg to the University.

“I think it’s super interesting 

to take Heidelberg out of con-
text and put it in a place like Ann 
Arbor,” she said.

Johnston has been encour-

aging students to get involved 
through word of mouth, start-
ing with her friends. LSA senior 
Alicia Speak said her friendship 
with Johnston influenced her to 
visit Heidelberg.

“Rachel has been talking 

about this for three years now,” 
Speak said. “She finally got me 
down here today and it’s really 
cool.”

Originally from Grosse Pointe, 

Speak has a history with the city 
and a desire to see it prosper.

“When I was younger I would 

come down and go to soup kitch-
ens, volunteer downtown all the 
time,” she said.

Project 
Manager 
Trista 

Dymond has worked for the 
Heidelberg Project nonprofit 
for the last four years and has 
noticed an influx of volunteers 
after the string of arson attacks 
in 2013.

“We had volunteer days before 

then, a lot of site beautification, 
that kind of stuff,” Dymond said. 
“When the fires came it was 
cleaning up the fire, and we had 
tons of students.”

Drivers from across 

Mich. showcase 

vehicles at Electric 

Car Week event

BY ISOBEL FUTTER

Daily Staff Reporter

The quiet lull of electric vehi-

cles cruised down Eisenhower 
Parkway in Ann Arbor on Sun-
day morning. More than 20 elec-
tric vehicles, including the Tesla 
Model S and the Chevrolet Volt, 
parked outside Whole Foods so 
their owners could share their 
passion for driving green.

The Ann Arbor Drive Elec-

tric Week Car Show, which cor-
responded with Drive Electric 
Week, attracted electric auto-
owners from all over Michigan.

Drive Electric Week is a 

nationwide 
celebration 
to 

heighten awareness of plug-in 
vehicles and highlight the ben-
efits of all-electric and plug-in 
hybrid vehicles. The show was 

one of 195 nationwide events 
aligned with the weeklong cel-
ebration.

Bruce Westlake, president of 

Michigan Electric Auto Asso-
ciation, said the car show is ben-
eficial in educating Ann Arbor 
residents about the perks of 
owning a plug-in vehicle.

“There’s a lot of misinforma-

tion out about plug-in vehicles,” 
Westlake said. “What we’re try-
ing to do is help people under-
stand change because it is a 
considerable change in how they 
drive their cars, and sometimes 
it’s daunting.”

Westlake said the event show-

cases the availability of electric 
vehicles and helps drivers feel 
more at ease about the cars.

“We try to get people com-

fortable with how to charge 
them and get to see the different 
types that are available at differ-
ent dealerships,” Westlake said.

The event was co-sponsored 

by Michigan Electric Auto Asso-
ciation, the Ann Arbor Ecology 
Center, Whole Foods, the Drive 
Electric Ann Arbor Partner-

ship, BMW of Ann Arbor, Ann 
Arbor Automotive and the Ann 
Arbor Downtown Development 
Authority.

Charles Griffith, director of 

the Ecology Center’s Climate 
and Energy Program, said the 
event, as well as local efforts to 
make charging stations more 
available to residents, are help-
ing Ann Arbor become a more 
plug-in friendly city.

“For one thing, the city’s 

Downtown 
Development 

Authority is a really big player 
in this topic,” Griffith said. 
“They have been working to 
get electric charging stations 
in downtown parking areas and 
structures.”

Since 2012, the DDA has 

installed 23 charging locations 
across the city and internal 
studies have found them to be 
popular. 

DDA representatives attend-

ed the car show and spoke with 
visitors about the availability of 
plug-ins in the area.

Union renovations draw ire 

PE ACE OUT

A group of students con-

tested control of the Michi-
gan Union as renovations 
were underway to create a 
more student-oriented facil-
ity.

Students who were part 

of a committee called the 
Michigan Student Interim 
Advisory Council wanted 
more control over decisions 
related to both the physical 
and philosophical restruc-
turing of the building.

However, 
University 

administrators said it was 
unlikely 
students 
would 

gain more say in how the 
changes would be made. The 
Michigan Union Director 
Frank Cianciola had already 

asked many students on the 
committee for input before 
the rennovation.

The 
student 
commit-

tee itself was also divided. 
Some students felt they had 
enough say without having 
an official advisory position 
alongside the administra-
tors, but others thought such 
a role was necessary.

The committee ultimate-

ly proposed a governance 
structure for the Union 
that gave all 18 seats on the 
Union executive commit-
tee to students. The pro-
posal outlined that students 
would have authority over 
space usage in the building, 
financial planning, director 

evaluation, 
programming 

and planning and University 
relations.

The committee planned 

to propose their organiza-
tional structure in front 
of the Michigan Student 
Assembly, the precursor to 
Central 
Student 
Govern-

ment, following three open 
hearings. 

Administrators said the 

biggest issue with a student-
dominated board is that the 
issues facing the Union don’t 
solely pertain to students — 
they pertain to faculty, staff 
and alumni as well.

Electric car owners and companies offered their cars for test-drives and answered questions about driving electric at the 
Ride and Drive event as part of Drive Electric Week at Whole Foods on Eisenhower Parkway on Sunday.


should be the driving force of 
GOP efforts in 2016, citing wel-
fare programs in arguing that 
Democrats don’t believe that 
everybody is equal in capability.

“I am a Republican because I 

know that no one of us is any bet-
ter than any other one of us,” she 
said. “Progressives don’t believe 
this. They do not believe that 
everybody has god-given gifts. 
They do not believe that every-
one has potential. They actually 
believe some are smarter than 
others, some are better than oth-
ers, therefore some are going to 
take care of others.”

An hour later, Paul explored 

another question of party iden-
tity, saying Republicans could 
and should become the party 
known for passionately defend-
ing justice by guarding the Sixth 
Amendment, which guarantees 
the right to a speedy trial, with 
as much energy as the Second 
Amendment receives. 

Citing the story of Kalief 

Browder — a 22-year-old man 
who committed suicide earlier 
this year after spending three 
years 
imprisoned 
at 
Rikers 

Island without being convicted 
of a crime — he said small-gov-
ernment ideals could address 
inequities in the U.S. criminal 
justice system.

“It’s hard for us to understand 

that,” Paul said of Browder to the 
crowd. “If it was our kid, we’ve 
got the money to get him out. 
We’d go get a good lawyer and 
get him out.”

“It’s happening in our coun-

try,” he continued. “Criminal 
justice isn’t being applied. And 
you say, ‘what are you doing?’ 
You’re saying it’s racist, that 
we’re just arresting Black peo-
ple? No, but what happens is, 
because we have all these laws, 
and crime tends to be commit-
ted in the cities in close proxim-
ity, there’s more poor people and 
there’s more African Americans 
in the city.”

Paul also spoke directly to 

the GOP’s identity in Michi-
gan, where the state Republican 

party traditionally sees victories 
during the midterm elections 
— when the governor, attorney 
general and other state leader-
ship positions are elected — but 
dominance by Democrats in the 
presidential election.

To gain more votes in these 

cycles, Paul urged a more strict 
adherence to conservative values.

“The one thing we’re not get-

ting is we’re not winning the 
presidential years,” Paul said. 
“This is the big debate in the 
party. Many in the party say we 
just need to dilute what we stand 
for; we need to become Demo-
crat-light, offer the people who 
want government largess, offer 
them just a little bit less than the 
Democrats do, but offer them 
free stuff. I couldn’t disagree 
more. We need to be more boldly 
for what we are for.”

Speaking after both speeches 

of the evening had concluded, 
Mackinaw City resident Craig 
Patterson said he appreciated 
what Fiorina’s remarks, as well 
as Paul’s push for justice, said 
about the perception of the GOP.

“It’s freshness, frankly, to 

have this diversity of thought in 
the party,” he said. “I wish it all 
could get out in a way that every-
body can understand that there’s 
a diversity of thought and many 
of the thoughts are important to 
the future of Americans.”

Along with party identity, 

both Fiorina and Paul also ques-
tioned the efficacy of the current 
Republican Party.

“How long have we been talk-

ing in the Republican party about 
reducing debt and deficits?” Fio-
rina said. “How long have we 
been talking about limiting the 
size of government? How long 
have we been talking about tax 
reform? We have all the right 
ideas, folks, but we never get 
them done. Because to get those 
ideas put in place requires chal-
lenging the status quo.”

She discussed several policy 

objectives, 
including 
requir-

ing the inspector generals of 
agencies to report to Congress 
and zero-based budgeting, as 
examples of how she would ful-
fil that ideal. With zero-based 
budgeting, every expense has 

to be justified with each new 
budget, whereas traditional bud-
gets often work off the previous 
year’s base and emphasize justi-
fication for new expenditures or 
spending cuts. 

Paul took a similar tack, high-

lighting the idea of challenging 
the status quo.

Referencing a September 30 

deadline for the federal govern-
ment to pass appropriations bills 
for the 2016 fiscal year — none have 
been passed so far — he said the 
Republican majority in Congress 
wasn’t enough to disrupt the norm.

“Our government is literally 

out of control,” he said. “And 
you say, well, we elected Repub-
licans. Why is it not any better? 
I’ll tell you why it isn’t any bet-
ter: because we don’t have peo-
ple who will stand up and say 
enough’s enough. We lurch from 
deadline to deadline.”

Paul also cast himself as 

unique among GOP candidates 
due to his foreign-policy plat-
form, criticizing the practice 
of providing funds and arms to 
some countries in the Middle 
East.

“Sometimes, in war, there’s 

no good side and we might not 
want to participate,” Paul said. 
“This is an important question. 
The people that are running for 
office, almost every one of them, 
I guarantee you, will get us 
involved in Yemen. Why? They 
say, ‘Well Iran’s in Yemen and 
we have to stop them.’ Well, who 
else is in Yemen? Al-Qaeda. So 
Iranian-backed rebels are kill-
ing Al-Qaeda. Maybe we should 
buy popcorn.”

Both Paul and Fiorina had 

a strong showing on the island 
before and after their remarks, 
coming in first and second place, 
respectively, in a straw poll of 
attendees conducted by The 
Detroit News and MIRS. Paul 
came out on top with 22 percent, 
with Fiorina receiving 15 percent.

Three other Republican pres-

idential candidates also spoke 
on the island over the weekend 
— former Florida governor Jeb 
Bush, Sen. Ted Cruz (Texas) and 
Ohio Gov. John Kasich. They 
received 9.7, 13 and 13.8 percent, 
respectively, in the straw poll.

you,” Gross said. “This building 
was long overdue.”

The new facility features sever-

al common areas — previously in 
short supply for nursing students 
— as well as eco-friendly elements 
like native plantings and a water-
saving design.

High-tech 
simulation 
labs 

equipped 
with 
lifelike 
man-

nequins will simulate various 
medical ailments, allowing nurs-
ing students to acquire addi-
tional hands-on practice. One 
mannequin can be programmed 
to exhibit a variety of medical 
issues including cardiac arrest 
and strokes. The second, affec-
tionately named “Victoria,” can 
simulate birth every half-hour.

“We can set this up so that you 

can actually feel the baby inside,” 
said 
Dr. 
Michelle 
Aebersold, 

director of the Clinical Learning 
Center. “She’ll have contractions, 
and we’ll set her up to deliver that 
baby within so many contrac-
tions.”

The new building’s Clinical 

Learning Center also features a 
system to simulate the kinds of 
unexpected problems that often 
arise in an emergency.

“I can simulate a power out-

age and the students have to learn 
how to respond to that,” Aeber-
sold said.

While some nursing students 

work with the mannequin, the 
rest of the class is able to watch 
on television screens in a sepa-
rate room while their instructors 
guide them through procedures 
and provide instructions on how 
to respond in real-life situations.

Another focal point in the 

Nursing School’s new building 
is their upgraded classroom set-
tings, which are set up to accom-
date more learning opportunities 
done in teams.

Mary Beth Lewis, the school’s 

communications and marketing 
manager, said the new facility 
allows for an engaging learning 
experience, which studies have 
shown to be a particularly effec-
tive learning method.

“When they’re working on a 

group project, rather than going 
through all the examples, the pro-
fessor can give each table their 
own project,” she said, “It’s not 
just purely a lecture, it’s students 
working together.”

Nursing 
sophomore 
Alexis 

Valenciano said she and her peers 
are very excited to take classes in 
the new building.

“The new building is definitely 

going to make us better nurses.”

sometimes difficult responsibility 
required in his new role.

“Although there are going to 

be challenges, they’re good chal-
lenges,” Seto said. “I look forward 
to working with a lot of people to 
address them.”

Eddie Washington, executive 

director of DPSS, said Seto will 
bring a wealth of experience to 
University Housing Security.

“Throughout his service, he 

built a strong record of leadership, 
community engagement and col-
laboration,” Washington wrote 
in an e-mail interview. “Seto has 
been a strong supporter of DPSS 
and the University community 
and has partnered in many stu-
dent safety initiatives over the 
years.”

The University’s selection has 

drawn some criticism. Because 
Seto oversaw the AAPD when an 
officer fatally shot Ann Arbor res-
ident Aura Rosser last year, some 
students said Seto’s selection was 
a poor choice.

Following a Michigan State 

Police investigation, the Washt-
enaw County Prosecutor’s Office 
declined to press charges against 

the officer, considering the shoot-
ing an act of “lawful self-defense.” 
The shooting occurred as nation-
al conversations focused more 
closely on police brutality, partic-
ularly in light of incidents in Fer-
guson, Mo. and Baltimore, Md.

Rackham 
student 
Austin 

McCoy said Seto’s appointment is 
concerning. McCoy is also a mem-
ber of Ann Arbor to Ferguson, a 
local activist group that organizes 
against police brutality.

“I understand Seto’s history 

with U-M goes back to the start 
of his career in law enforcement, 
and that it was positive,” McCoy 
wrote in an e-mail. “However, I 
find the University’s hiring of him 
troubling considering how one of 
his officers shot and killed a black 
woman on his watch. The Univer-
sity’s decision seems tone-deaf.”

Rackham 
student 
Maryam 

Aziz, another member of Ann 
Arbor to Ferguson, said she is 
uncomfortable with the hire.

“Under Seto’s tenure, Aura 

Rosser was shot and killed almost 
a year ago, a death that brought 
the Black Lives Matter Movement 
to Ann Arbor,” Aziz wrote in an 
e-mail. “While shallow changes 
such as body cameras were more 
or less given consideration, they 
have not been enough.”

In the wake of the Rosser 

case and other incidents across 
the country, the Ann Arbor City 
Council unanimously voted to 
upgrade police in-car and body 
cameras in December 2014. The 
cameras are intended to assist 
officers in objectively reviewing 
police interactions with the pub-
lic.

In February, Seto addressed 

the Rosser shooting during an 
Ann Arbor City Council meeting.

“The community expects its 

officers to resolve a wide range of 
conflict,” Seto said. “When doing 
so, they have a duty to protect 
citizens who are in danger and 
they have a right to protect them-
selves. Both were required of Offi-
cers Ried and Raab on November 
9.”

Through 
DPSS 
spokesper-

son Diane Brown, Seto declined 
to discuss the case. However, 
Brown said the division is willing 
to engage in dialogue with stu-
dents who have concerns about 
Seto’s hiring or any other aspect 
of DPSS.

“We welcome the opportu-

nity to speak with those who are 
concerned with DPSS programs, 
procedures or hirings,” she said. 
“Our number one priority is stu-
dents.”

E

ver since I created my Face-
book profile in eighth grade, 
I became vaguely aware 

of the purported evils of social 
media. 
Teach-

ers warned that 
it would reduce 
attention spans, 
decrease 
face-

to-face interac-
tions and distort perceptions of 
reality. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the 
constant distraction of online com-
munication and therefore ignored 
the skeptics. Until I disconnected 
from technology for the better part 
of a month this past summer, I had 
no idea the extent to which I let 
social media dictate my feelings of 
happiness and self-worth. 

As part of my job as a summer 

camp counselor, I was not permit-
ted to use my phone during the day. 
This rule meant that I was free 
from the pressures of comparing 
myself to the images with which 
my peers presented themselves on 
social media. Instead of devoting 
energy toward creating a facade of 
constant happiness and achieve-
ment, I now had more time to live 
my life authentically.

Getting “likes” on social media 

can make us feel good about our-
selves, but this feeling is short-lived 
and compels us to rely on exter-
nal validation for our feelings of 
self-worth. Prior to this summer, I 
completely relied on other people’s 
decision to press a button in order to 
feel good about myself. I convinced 
myself that if no one acknowledged 
that I had an enjoyable day, my day 
might as well not have happened. I 
wasted countless brain cells won-
dering why my friends appeared 
to be so much happier and more 

popular than me on social media. 
With little recognition in the form 
of “likes” for the content I was 
posting, I began feeling as if my 
thoughts and ideas didn’t matter.

Working at a technology-free 

camp allowed me to relearn how 
to be happy on the inside. When-
ever I did something fun, I made a 
point of telling myself, “That was 
an amazing moment in my day. And 
I didn’t capture it and upload it to 
social media. But that doesn’t mean 
it didn’t happen.” I felt warm and 
fuzzy from the genuine connec-
tions I was making with the people 
and places around me, and I knew 
this was far more satisfying than 
any “like” I could possibly receive 
on social media.

Since refraining from social 

media usage at the University is 
unrealistic for me, I have instead 
chosen to limit the amount of time 
I spend online and to use that time 
in a healthier, more constructive 
manner. Whenever I feel distressed 
from seeing all my happy-looking 
friends, I step back and assess the 
situation. I remind myself that I, 
too, am happy, and that there is 
enough happiness to go around for 
everyone. No one else’s experience 
of joy can possibly negate my own 
positive feelings about my life.

I also remind myself that the 

content people upload only reveals 
a tiny sliver of their realities. After 
all, what does a post of happiness 
and achievement convey about a 
person? A profile picture of some-
one looking radiant and flawless 
tells me that this person had access 
to good lighting and a high defini-
tion camera. An Instagram post of 
someone holding a Michigan flag 
atop a mountain in a foreign coun-

try tells me that this person trav-
eled to a foreign country, ended 
up on top of a mountain and took a 
picture. A status in which someone 
shares an acceptance letter tells me 
that this person applied to a pro-
gram and was admitted.

What these posts don’t tell me 

is how my friends were actually 
feeling at the time. There have 
been numerous occasions when 
I assumed that my friends were 
happy but later found out they 
struggled with body-image issues, 
had unfulfilling summer adven-
tures or received hundreds of rejec-
tion letters before finally hearing 
good news. While not everyone 
struggles equally, we all have bur-
dens to bear that we might not 
feel comfortable sharing online. 
Those who appear happy, success-
ful and popular on social media are 
not immune to these issues; they 
often simply aren’t sharing the 
full picture.

Now that I partake in social 

media more mindfully, networks 
like Facebook and Instagram hold 
less weight in my life. I see them 
as additional ways to communicate 
with friends and acquaintances 
rather than the main determinants 
of my feelings of self-worth. Because 
I no longer try to compare my life to 
those of my peers, I am able to feel 
genuine happiness for others when 
I see my friends post about their 
achievements. And if I ever become 
overwhelmed with anxiety while 
scrolling through my feed, I know 
it’s time to exit out, put down my 
phone and go make some authentic, 
happy memories.

T

he Department of Education has finally released its new College 
Scorecard website — three years after it was first proposed by 
President Barack Obama — just in time for the current college 

application season. While organizations like U.S. News & World Report 
dominate the field of college rankings, the White House intends to 
have its newest program shine light onto factors such as student loan 
debt, financial aid packages and graduate salary, which typically are 
ignored in traditional rankings methodology. Obama envisions the 
scorecard as a tool that will “help all of us see which schools do the 
best job of preparing America for success.” It is a breath of fresh air 
in the tedious process of choosing a college, especially when schools 
are more likely to advertise their reputation and endowments and less 
likely to mention important statistics like graduation rate and average 
 

post-graduation salary.

College rankings are often pulled into 

controversies as their systems are accused of 
preconceived biases and skewed weighting 
systems. With the data coming straight 
from the federal government, students 
can rest assured, knowing that college 
evaluations are derived from an objective 
source. 
Additionally, 
through 
compiling 

thousands of schools into one source, the 
College Scorecard has the potential to save 
students time and energy that could have 
been wasted scrolling through endless 
“college information” websites. The College 
Scorecard website streamlines the college 
searching process by displaying information 
about a particular school alongside national 
averages, stepping away from arbitrary 
rankings. No first place, no 46th place — just 
a practical, straightforward report. Users 
are able to immediately view three pertinent 
statistics: average annual cost, graduation 
rate and salary after attending. The site’s clear 
navigation also allows users to easily access 
other statistics and information important to 
their specific needs.

Alumni salaries, debt and loans finally 

take center stage over average standardized 
test scores or high-school GPA. That kind of 
information is included in a given school’s 
profile, but it’s not emphasized heavily; these 
statistics are at the bottom of a school’s profile 
page and are fairly simplistic. Some critics of 
the new program may attack this relative lack 
of data concerning the “academic strength” 
of students attending a certain school, but by 
focusing more on the financial aspect of going 
to college as well as graduation and retention 
rates, the federal government has reiterated 
its position in the conversation of higher 
education: Schools need to be affordable and 
effective. Hopefully, the scorecards will work 
as a positive step in finding a solution to the 
ever-growing issues of college affordability 
and the student debt crisis. For low-income 
or first-generation students, this information 
can be necessary in cases where attending 

college is not just another step in life, but a 
step out of a life.

The College Scorecard is not without its 

caveats (which is understandable, given the 
website launched barely a week ago). For 
example, currently, the University’s own 
scorecard on the website lists the annual 
average cost as $16,287, a number that would be 
scoffed at by out-of-state students, who make 
up more than half the combined undergraduate 
and graduate student body, and, on average, 
pay more than $43,000 per academic year, not 
including housing costs. This information is 
not meant to be misleading; hovering over the 
question-mark icon above the listed average 
cost provides a small explanation that says that 
the number generated only reflects “average 
cost for in-state students” at the University. 
But instead of trying to compensate for only 
listing in-state tuition with this explanation, 
the College Scorecard should aim to include 
statistics for both in- and out-of-state students.

Additionally, 
the 
report 
lacks 
any 

information regarding the cost of room and 
board at the University, which can come close 
to matching the price of tuition for in-state 
students. In defense of the White House, 
room and board fluctuates more dynamically 
than annual tuition rates and varies based 
on housing situation. Because housing costs 
can vary widely depending on an individual 
student’s living situation on campus, the 
website’s creators may have chosen to simply 
omit respective information. If this is the case, 
the website should include a brief explanation 
acknowledging this fact.

Ultimately, while the College Scorecard 

should not be the only tool used to evaluate 
colleges, 
students 
should 
embrace 
the 

program as a new mode of evaluating schools 
and push colleges to be more transparent 
about affordability and life after graduation. 
With growing competition in the job market, 
colleges need to ensure that their students are 
not only prepared academically, but can also 
thrive financially after graduation.

A good way to keep score

College Scorecard is a better tool than college rankings

T

he French satirical maga-
zine Charlie Hebdo, which 
made international head-

lines after being 
attacked 
for 

its 
depictions 

of the Prophet 
Muhammad, has 
made the news 
again. Their latest edition features 
drawings of Aylan Kurdi, the Syrian 
child who drowned off the coast of 
Turkey, juxtaposed with images of 
Jesus and a McDonald’s billboard 
advertising “two kid’s meals for the 
price of one.”

These publications have sparked 

outrage from people across the 
world, who accuse its editors of 
mocking the child’s death, in addi-
tion to being xenophobic and insen-
sitive. This stands in stark contrast 
to the public’s reaction to the ear-
lier drawings of Muhammad, which 
was overwhelmingly supportive 
of Charlie Hebdo’s right to free 
expression and began the move-
ment, “Je suis Charlie.” What can 
explain this discrepancy?

Some people have argued that 

Charlie Hebdo’s latest drawings 
have overstepped their bounds and 
no longer constitute satire, whereas 
the drawings of Muhammad did. I 
find this distinction arbitrary, but I 
can see where it comes from. It’s a 
pervasive misconception about sat-
ire that it aims to make you laugh 
— the sort of neck-whipped-back, 
bellowing laugh that the likes of 
John Oliver solicit. And in a cul-
ture brought up on “The Colbert 
Report” and “The Daily Show with 
Jon Stewart,” it’s easy to believe 

that this is the only kind of satire 
that exists. But despite its macabre 
subject matter, these recent car-
toons are clearly satirical in nature. 
The one featuring a McDonald’s 
billboard is captioned “so close to 
his goal ... ” and attacks European 
consumerism and ridicules the 
idea that refugees are willing to 
risk their lives for simple economic 
gains. Hilarious? Not really. Satiri-
cal? Undoubtedly.

Another argument I’ve heard 

is that the latest drawings are so 
deeply offensive that freedom of 
expression should be checked. 
But who, exactly, is the victim of 
offense? Kurdi? Kurdi’s family? 
Anyone who has children Kurdi’s 
age? It also is not at all obvious that 
Kurdi is being mocked, as many 
articles have claimed. 

A level-headed interpretation 

of the cartoons would reveal that 
it is Europe’s attitude toward the 
refugee crisis that is the object 
of ridicule. The cover featuring a 
proud-looking Jesus walking on 
water proclaims: “proof that Europe 
is Christian: Christians walk on 
water, Muslim children sink/run” 
(a play on words: the French word 
“couler” can mean to sink or to 
run). This is a scathing critique of 
European hypocrisy, specifically, 
recent Slovakian legislation which 
would allow the country to accept 
only Christian refugees and not 
Muslims. To this extent, Kurdi’s 
image is simply being used to rep-
resent Muslim refugees who are 
the victims of this double standard 
— hardly mocking at all.

This position also reveals a sub-

tle hypocrisy which should not be 
ignored. Why is it that these draw-
ings have been widely interpreted 
as 
being 
excessively 
offensive, 

whereas the drawings of Muham-
mad were not? I argue that this is 
simply due to cultural upbringing. 
You may not have grown up in a 
society where this one man has 
been revered as a prophet — whose 
name is invariably followed by the 
complementary phrase “peace be 
upon him” — and who is consid-
ered a supreme example of piety 
and morality. To a person with 
this upbringing, the cartoons of 
Muhammad, which often depicted 
him in a demeaning and derogatory 
manner, may even be more offen-
sive than the cartoon of Kurdi. It’s 
all a matter of perspective.

And this brings up a vital point. 

Personal opinions about offensive-
ness can vary dramatically from 
culture to culture, and person to 
person. So when it comes to a con-
cept as important as freedom of 
expression, taste cannot be a con-
sideration. Why should we care 
about 
some 
obscure 
magazine 

across the Atlantic? Because the 
freedom to speak also means the 
freedom to listen. For some of you, 
this column may have been the first 
time you heard about Slovakia’s 
deplorable laws regarding refugees. 
If we had let public perception of 
taste dictate what is and isn’t OK to 
publish, you may have never heard 
about it. We should never trust any-
one to make that distinction for us.

Sounds of teen 

suburbia

By ADAM THEISEN

Daily Music Columnist

N

inety-nine percent of 
the time, when some-
one picks up an acoustic 

guitar at a party, you’re about 
to be serenaded with “Won-
derwall,” 
or maybe 
“Wish You 
Were Here,” 
if everyone’s 
stoned. But if 
you’re with a 
certain sub-
urban scene, 
you can be 
pleasantly 
surprised. 
This past summer I was in a 
friend’s basement in my home-
town of Livonia, Michigan 
when a couple guys I’d known 
for years started to play a song 
for the small group — one on 
acoustic guitar and one sing-
ing. I could tell it was a song 
from one of the overwrought 
emotional bands that have a 
cult following where I’m from. 
I didn’t know what it was, but 
I liked its pseudo-poetic lyrics, 
its stream-of-consciousness 
delivery and the way it seemed 
to capture the room, enthralling 
everyone because the singer is 
just spewing his gut feelings to 
everyone within earshot while 
slowly building toward a gran-
diose tidal-wave climax.

I 
listened 
extra 
intently 

during the performance and 
then 
surreptitiously 
Googled 

the lyrics that I heard — the 
chorus of “I’m sure that we 
could find something for you 
to do on stage / Maybe shake a 
tambourine, or when I sing, you 
sing harmonies.” The song they 
were playing turned out to be 
“Twin Size Mattress” by The 
Front Bottoms, this folk-rock 
dramatic set piece about the end 
of a friendship, or a relationship, 
or just the collapse of something 
you know has to end even though 
you don’t want it to.

“Twin 
Size 
Mattress” 
is 

everything I love to hate about 
young suburban indie rock. 
Where I’m from — and I’m near-
positive this is true for other 
medium-sized 
Midwestern 

cities with homogenous (i.e. 
very 
white) 
populations 
— 

there’s a huge group of kids 
that fall through the cracks of 
pop, country or rap and find 
themselves 
obsessed 
with 

“emo” or “post-hardcore” or 
whatever they want to call this 
tricky-to-label subgenre of rock 
that prides itself on emotional 
honesty and catharsis. If you’re 
the right person in the right 
frame of mind, listening to these 
bands on headphones can be just 
like hearing your own internal 
monologue. Something about 
the hormonal anxiety in the 
vocals and stories of losing and 
finding love in the most intense 
ways possible makes people 
memorize all the words and 
write them on their notebooks 
and scream them with furious 
conviction at shows.

After a boom in the ’90s 

with bands like Jawbreaker, 
American Football, Sunny Day 
Real Estate and even records 
from bands like Jimmy Eat 
World and Weezer, emo has gone 
through some ups and downs 
in the last couple decades. The 
Front Bottoms, who just released 
a new record on September 18, 
are one of the new rising stars 
of this scene, but in general, the 
genre feels like it’s experiencing 
a resurgence with other bands 
like The Menzingers, Into It 
Over It and Modern Baseball. 
But the Rosetta Stone for all 
these 
dramatic 
artists 
and 

emotional fans is a band called 
Brand New and an album called 
Déjà Entendu.

Brian Eno once said, though 

The Velvet Underground & Nico 
only sold 30,000 copies in 1967, 
“everyone who bought one of 
those 30,000 copies started 
a band.” Well, Déjà Entendu 
wasn’t 
a 
huge 
commercial 

success either, but everyone 
who bought that album started 
an artsy, serious Tumblr. After 
a debut album that expertly 
executed but slavishly followed 

all the tropes of emo, Brand New 
took their sophomore release as 
an opportunity to completely 
reinvent the genre. It’s hard to 
put into words exactly what it is 
that makes Déjà Entendu such a 
classic. Maybe you need to listen 
to it after you’ve pulled an all-
nighter and the sun is rising on 
Sunday morning or after you’ve 
made a new connection with 
someone special or after you’ve 
fallen out of love for the first 
time, but something about that 
record plunges into the depths 
of your feelings, gets you to your 
core and stings you in a way 
that’s impossible to forget.

But if you become familiar 

with enough of these bands (not 
necessarily Brand New itself, 
but definitely the many acolytes 
they spawned), you’ll hear that 
practically all of these emo indie 
bands are exclusively made up of 
straight white men, and most of 
them are singing about youthful 
crushes and heartbreak. Here’s 
where we get to that “love to 
hate” part, because while I 
absolutely love ambitious rock 
music, sometimes you just want 
to shake all these heartbroken 
narrators and yell at them about 
how stupid they are. Whether 
they’re idealizing a nameless 
pretty girl and whining about 
how she doesn’t want to sleep 
with them or complaining that 
all the jocks are dating the girls 
they themselves want to be with 
or proclaiming how they’re the 
only ones who know how to treat 
a girl right, I’m so sick of what 
feels like the exact same dude in 
every single song dramatically 

complaining about how hard his 
privileged life is. I’m not saying 
the artists aren’t allowed to have 
problems, but at its worst, emo 
is loudly ignorant white male 
entitlement set to generic guitar 
music. (Jessica Hopper’s “Where 
the Girls Aren’t” is required 
reading if you love this genre.)

So that leads to an obvious 

question: How come I’ve been 
listening to these artists so 
much? Why listen to them at 
all? First of all, you don’t have 
to listen to this genre if you’re 
not into it. With the probable 
exception 
of 
Déjà 
Entendu, 

this scene hasn’t produced any 
objective modern classics. Emo 
is a genre that’s almost entirely 
shaped by the experiences and 
worldviews 
of 
its 
listeners, 

which means that if you’re not 
feeling the emotions or if you 
can’t relate to the feelings of 
the singer, don’t worry about 
appreciating it and just find 
something else you’ll enjoy.

But there’s a quote that I love 

in an oral history of the ’90s emo 
band Jawbreaker — this indie 
record label guy who said, “If you 
didn’t make out to a Jawbreaker 
song or wallow in self-pity after 
breaking up with somebody to 
a Jawbreaker song, then I don’t 
know what you were doing.” 
To me, that’s such an amazing 
reason to make music (or any 
kind of art). We should talk 
about all the problems of emo, 
because thousands of teenagers 
form their philosophies based on 
the artists, but when something 
about a song just makes you 
feel like it’s the center of the 
universe, that you want to do 
nothing but drive around all 
night and sing along until you 
lose your voice, that everything 
about it reminds you of your 
friends and lovers and infinite 
nights in your hometown, maybe 
that’s one of the greatest things a 
song can ever hope to do.

‘Report’ offers cool 
gadgets, not much else

By SOPHIA KAUFMAN

Daily Arts Writer

“Minority Report” is the 

first series to be adapted from 
a Steven Spielberg film, and 
the premiere 
doesn’t 
live 

up 
to 
the 

reasonable 
expectations, 
despite 
a 

captivating 
beginning. 
However, 
the 
episode 

manages 
to 
stay 

interesting, 
even with the 
amateurish 
acting and obvious one-liners.

Set in the future of 2026, 

the pilot begins with an overly 
explanatory 
but 
intriguing 

flashback to three children 
who have a unique ability 
to “see” any murder in their 
vicinity before it happens. This 
not-so-pleasant life is made 
worse when the government 
finds and kidnaps the children, 
robbing them of their childhood 
years by forcing them to churn 
out prediction after prediction 
of crimes for years. When this 
“pre-crime” program is shut 
down, the three children — 
twin brothers Dash and Arthur 
and their older sister Agatha — 
are sent away to be integrated 

into mainstream society after 
their records are destroyed to 
protect their identities.

Flash 
forward 
to 
their 

present and Dash (Stark Sands, 
“Inside 
Llewyn 
Davis”) 
is 

still trying to solve crimes by 
himself— but as the weakest 
of the three “pre-cogs,” it’s not 
working out well. He teams 
up with Lara Vega, (Meagan 
Good, “Think Like a Man”) a 
sharp and emotionally invested 
homicide detective who figures 
out 
his 
identity. 
The 
two 

work quickly together, each 
compensating for the other’s 
slight professional deficiencies, 
hoping to return the pre-crime 
program to its earlier success 
without drawing attention to 
what they’re doing (especially 
because it’s illegal).

Small, 
cute 
details 
are 

occasionally slipped into the 
film to remind us that our 
present is history to them. 
One character sighs for the 
simplicity 
of 
relationships 

in the days of Tinder, while 
Iggy Azalea is playing in the 
background on an old vinyl 
record. The whole city of 
Washington, D.C. looks like 
Times Square on steroids, as 
digital advertisements swim 
across 
the 
skies 
on 
large 

billboards, and all of the new 
and flashy technology reminds 
you of the gadgets in the “Spy 
Kids” movies.

Fortunately, 
the 
cast 
is 

diverse, 
and 
so 
far 
there 

haven’t been any major gender 
stereotypes in play; Good more 
than holds her own even as she 
is surrounded by men, taking 
up just as much presence as 
they. Unfortunately, the acting 
is subpar on all sides, which 
is surprising — some of the 
main actors have impressive 
credentials. 
Each 
brings 

the same kind of wide-eyed 
overacting usually relegated 
for single episode guests on 
procedurals like “Law and 
Order.” 
The 
dialogue 
can 

flow too smoothly to read as 
authentic; no one takes the 
time to process what the other 
has said, or is saying, or even 
will 
say 
(futuristic 
shows 

can get complicated) before 
contributing a witty rejoinder.

“Minority 
Report” 
does 

make 
you 
think, 
weaving 

in themes of predestination 
versus free will throughout 
the episode. Something about 
the show holds your attention, 
and it may be these existential 
questions 
brought 
up 
by 

meeting potential murderers 
who were locked up and seeing 
what kind of life they led after 
their convictions.

Or it could just be the cool 

gadgets.

Either way, those are really 

the only two reasons to keep 
watching.

Jim Harbaugh’s
cast of characters

T

he Michigan football 
team built its lead 
against UNLV on 

Saturday on a receiving 
touchdown 
by a running 
back and 
a rushing 
touchdown 
by a receiver. 
Then, a 
backup 
running back 
broke loose 
for a 76-yard 
touchdown 
to send the Wolverines into 
halftime ahead 21-0.

Finally, to cap Michigan’s 

scoring, its graduate-transfer 
quarterback checked down 
to a backup fullback to reach 
UNLV’s half-yard line. The 
backup fullback punched it in 
from there.

That’s the way things went 

for the Wolverines on Saturday. 
Their best offensive weapon, 
junior tight end Jake Butt, didn’t 
catch a pass until the fourth 
quarter. Their starting running 
back came out of the game for 
two series in the second half 
and finished with just 33 yards 
on 13 carries. And their defense, 
which — despite the emergence 
of redshirt junior defensive 
lineman Chris Wormley and 
a handful of other names — 
lacks a true star, protected the 
lead for the duration of the 
afternoon.

And that’s the way things will 

have to be for Michigan for the 
time being. In his first season, 
without time to overhaul the 
roster to his liking, Michigan 
coach Jim Harbaugh has pieced 
together a combination of 
contributors in hopes of creating 
a successful season out of what 
he inherited.

He wants tight ends? Fine. 

He’ll rely on Butt, mix in senior 
A.J. Williams and redshirt 
sophomore Khalid Hill, groom 
redshirt freshman Ian Bunting 
and convert former defensive 
end Henry Poggi.

He wants fullbacks? No 

problem. He’ll start Joe 
Kerridge, then go to Sione 
Houma — who scored his first 
career touchdown on a one-yard 
run — when Kerridge leaves the 
game with an ankle injury.

He wants power running? OK. 

But he’ll have to do it with the 
offensive line he was given, one 
of the more maligned units in the 
country the past two years.

And with two years of 

experience 
together 
and the help 
of the new 
coaching staff, 
the offensive 
line has come 
together to 
be at least 
serviceable, 
paving the 
way for 479 
rushing yards 
in the past two games.

As for who gets those rushing 

yards, that depends on the week, 
too. Last week against Oregon 
State, it was junior De’Veon 
Smith, who broke out for 23 
carries, 126 yards and three 
touchdowns. This week, junior 
Ty Isaac was the leading rusher 
with 114 yards on eight carries, 
including a 76-yard touchdown 
in the second quarter.

After the game, Harbaugh 

denied — even mocked — 
the idea of a running-back 
controversy.

“I think we’ll play as many 

good players as we can play and 
find roles to try to put them in 
as many roles as they can be 
successful,” Harbaugh said. “It’s 

a team game.”

Eventually, maybe Harbaugh 

will want a back who carries 
the ball at least 20 times every 
game, who gains at least 100 
yards almost every game, 
who milks the clock to secure 
a victory at the end of every 
game.

But maybe that’s not what 

he has right now. He has had a 
100-yard rusher in two straight 
games. If it’s two different 
100-yard rushers, so be it. That 
might have to do for now.

“That’s part of game planning 

— putting in the player you 
want for the play,” Harbaugh 
said. “Trying to use everybody’s 

talent. Trying 
to get as 
many people 
involved as 
possible. I 
think we’re 
doing a good 
job of that 
at multiple 
positions — 
running back, 
fullback, tight 
end.”

Fullback has been a key 

position in almost all of 
Harbaugh’s offenses. Saturday, 
when Kerridge went down, 
Harbaugh turned to Houma for 
Michigan’s fourth touchdown. 
He knows what he wants his 
team to look like. If he has to 
shuffle and swap and fill in the 
gaps initially, he’ll do it.

Harbaugh acted like he 

didn’t understand a question 
about position controversies. 
He just doesn’t worry about 
them.

“It’s as clear as I can tell 

you,” Harbaugh said. “The 
more good players that we can 
have, the better for our football 
team. We’re encouraging that 
as much as we possibly can, 

and our players are responding 
to it.”

The only position he was 

prepared to answer was 
quarterback.

Ah, yes, the quarterback. The 

clear starter there is Rudock, a 
makeshift solution himself who 
transferred from Iowa after he 
lost the starting job at the end 
of last season. He had another 
mixed game Saturday, finishing 
14-for-22 for 123 yards with a 
touchdown and an interception 
— his fifth in three games, 
equaling his total from all of last 
season.

But he did his job, in 

Harbaugh’s eyes. No one 
seems to have a major role, but 
everyone has some role.

“His job is to win football 

games,” Harbaugh said. “I 
thought he did a good job. 
Managed the game well. For 
the most part, the offense was 
moving darn near every time we 
got the ball.”

That’s more than Michigan 

could say at this time last year. 
Harbaugh hasn’t magically 
turned any players into 
superstars — as some may 
have thought he would — but 
the improvement is clear. One 
of the effects of the constant 
competition he enforces is that 
one player is always ready to 
step in.

Together, they make up an 

interesting cast of characters. 
A receiving running back, a 
running receiver, a backup 
running back and a backup 
fullback might not be the ideal 
situation for Harbaugh in the 
long run. But they’re what he 
has for now, so he has to make 
it work.

Waves, wins
and worry-
free football

The tension in the Big House 

was palpable in the dwindling 
minutes of the third quarter of 
Saturday’s 
Michigan 
football 
game. The 
fans, all 
108,683 of 
them, were 
attempting 
to complete 
an entire 
cycle of the 
traditional 
Michigan 
Stadium wave.

The first time around, they 

raised their arms in normal 
wave fashion, rhythmically 
lifting themselves from their 
benches only to sit back down a 
moment later. They transitioned 
into a slow-motion wave and 
then a fast wave that flashed 
around the stadium in a blur. 
When that lap was finished, they 
reversed directions and sent the 
wave around the stadium the 
other way. It was nice and easy, 
creating a relaxed atmosphere 
that led to reverberating cheers.

But then came the tough part: 

the split wave. It was a daring 
feat, one that only the bravest 
fans could pull off. “Oohs” and 
“aahs” were audible in the crowd. 
The fans sent the wave in two 
opposite directions at the same 
time, until the two separate 
waves met in the middle and 
continued on their respective 
paths. The stadium roared. 
They’d pulled off the most 
difficult feat of them all.

Beneath them, the Wolverines 

were playing a game, and nobody 
cared.

It was a beautiful kind of 

apathy. For the first time in 
years, the reason people didn’t 
care wasn’t because the students 
were too drunk or the alumni too 
disgruntled at the prospect of 
another lost season.

It was because nobody in 

Michigan Stadium experienced 
a second of doubt Saturday that 
the Wolverines could possibly 
lose to UNLV. This might seem 
trivial to older Michigan fans, the 
ones who have lived most of their 
lives watching Michigan beat the 
slobber out of inferior opponents.

But for several years now, 

those moments of supreme 
confidence have disappeared. 
Sure, Jake Rudock might not 
have played to your liking, and 
Michigan should probably have 
converted on that pesky drive 
when it ran the ball on 3rd-and-1 
and 4th-and-1. But look at that 
scoreboard! It read, “Michigan 
21, UNLV 0.”

Cue the wave.
When was the last time 

Michigan won two games 
in a row by at least three 
touchdowns like it has the 
last two weekends? October 
2012. This year’s seniors were 
freshmen, and the Wolverines 
trounced an inept Illinois team 
on Oct. 13 for the second of those 
three-touchdown wins. Three 
years ago, it poured throughout 
the day, just like it did before 
Saturday’s game. But Saturday, 
the rain dissipated just in time 
for Jim Harbaugh to run onto 
the field to coach the Wolverines 

at home for the second time.

There are naysayers who 

claim that Harbaugh hasn’t 
done anything yet, that all of the 
hype is overblown for somebody 
who probably won’t even win 
the Big Ten for a few years. But 
if you were at the Big House 
on Saturday, you know that 
something is different. It feels 
different.

For two straight weeks, you’ve 

been able to watch Michigan 
cruise past a lesser team and 
then go home and sit on your 
couch and watch as other 
historically proud programs 
struggle against MAC teams 
and the like. Did you see that 
Ohio State game? Spoiler alert: 
The Buckeyes won, but come on. 
Those fans weren’t doing the 
wave in the third quarter.

For once, the team threatened 

by an upset wasn’t Michigan. 
There won’t be an Appalachian 
State or an Akron or a Toledo 
this year. There haven’t been 
nails gnawed to the point of 
blood or hair ripped from the 
scalp because of close games 
in the fourth quarter against a 
weak non-conference opponent.

For the first time in too long, 

things have unfolded exactly 
the way they were supposed to, 
two weeks in a row. UNLV was 
overmatched this week, and so 
was Oregon State last week.

Twice, Michigan gave you a 

Saturday free of worry. Twice, 
the other side had no hope, save 
for a few minutes in the first 
quarter when Oregon State stood 
a slight chance.

The wins were so easy, so 

automatic, that Ryan Glasgow 
was angry that Michigan had 
allowed UNLV to score at all, 
and Harbaugh ranted that he 
will never use the word satisfied 
in terms of football, that even 
blowout wins aren’t enough.

The Wolverines are still a 

rebuilding team, far from a 
finished product. Harbaugh 
didn’t recruit most of the 
athletes on the field, and even 
the most experienced Michigan 
players have barely had a taste 
of winning at the college level. 
They have almost lost to Akron 
and Connecticut in the final 
minutes of games, and they have 
been destroyed by better teams 
from the first quarter on. But 
for two games in September, 
in the year when everything is 
supposed to be changing, the 
Wolverines showed signs of 
being a competent football team.

“They did what we asked 

them to do, and that was take 
care of business,” Harbaugh said.

It might not seem like much, 

but that’s exactly what the 
Wolverines needed the last two 
weeks. Nobody knows how this 
team will deal with Big Ten play 
or even a solid BYU team next 
week. Michigan’s flaws could 
rear their ugly heads, or the 
confidence from two blowout 
wins could create momentum.

But just in case things turn 

out well, the fans will be ready. 

They’ve already had practice 

doing the wave.

The good, bad and 
ugly: ‘M’ vs. UNLV

By MAX BULTMAN

Daily Sports Editor

The Michigan football team 

cruised to its second win of the 
season Saturday, downing UNLV, 
28-7. For the most part, it was a 
boring affair.

Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 

ran his usual ground-and-pound 
offense, wearing down the Rebels 
and the clock in a game that went 
by fast but felt slow.

The 
Daily 
looks 
at 
the 

good, bad and ugly from the 
Wolverines’ win.

The good

Explosive runs worked for the 

Wolverines on Saturday.

Up 7-0 in the first, redshirt 

junior receiver Jehu Chesson 
took a jet sweep 36 yards for 
a score. Then junior running 
back Ty Isaac broke a 76-yard 
touchdown 
along 
the 
left 

sideline on a play that Harbaugh 
initially thought would result in 
a tackle for loss. Fortunately for 
Harbaugh and Isaac, fifth-year 
senior center Graham Glasgow 
got out ahead and plowed the 
way for Michigan’s longest rush 
since 2012.

Redshirt junior running back 

Drake 
Johnson 
carried 
five 

times for 28 yards on the day, an 
encouraging sight for a player 
coming off his second anterior 
cruciate 
ligimant 
tear 
last 

November.

On defense, the Wolverines 

had two interceptions, winning 
the turnover battle for just the 
second time in their last 16 games. 
Redshirt junior Jeremy Clark 
picked off his second pass of the 
season at the end of the third 
quarter, and junior cornerback 
Channing Stribling snatched the 
first pick of his career.

The bad

Fifth-year senior quarterback 

Jake 
Rudock 
looked 

underwhelming, at best, against 
the Rebels.

Rudock 
totaled 
just 
123 

yards on 14-of-22 passing to go 
with a touchdown pass and an 
interception, and neither the 
touchdown nor the interception 
was particularly consequential. 
The score was a dump off to 
De’Veon Smith, who did most of 
the work, and the interception 
came when the game was out of 
hand.

Harbaugh 
said 
after 
the 

game he was happy with the 
timing between Rudock and 
his receivers, but on multiple 
occasions, it seemed out of sync. 
In the third quarter, Rudock 
missed 
a 
wide-open 
Drake 

Johnson in the flat with an entire 
field in front of him.

The wind swirling through 

the stadium during the game 
could 
help 
explain 
it, 
but 

Rudock missed other receivers 
throughout the day, too.

Rudock was billed as a steady 

option 
at 
quarterback, 
not 

winning games on his own but 
not losing them, either. But so far, 
he hasn’t exactly been the picture 
of consistency.

Through three games, Rudock 

has as many interceptions — five 
— as he did all of last season. 
His Total QBR, a stat created by 
ESPN to measure quarterback 
performance, is 36.9, a stark 
drop-off from the 70.5 mark he 
posted last year.

The ugly

Has anyone ever called fashion 

model-turned-punter 
Blake 

O’Neill ugly?

Admittedly, 
the 
fifth-year 

senior 
who 
transferred 
to 

Michigan from Weber State 
this year has been every bit as 
good as expected. But there 
wasn’t anything truly ugly about 
yesterday’s game for Michigan, 
and O’Neill did make one bad 
play. So his 17-yard shanked punt 
has to take the fall.

The rest of the day, O’Neill 

was phenomenal, hammering 
one 59-yard punt and downing 
another at the three-yard line.

‘M’ beats Iowa, Nebraska

Haidar’s goal 
in 89th minute 

Sunday completes 

weekend sweep

By MITCH BECKMAN

Daily Sports Writer

In the 89th minute of its 

Sunday 
afternoon 
game, a 0-0 
tie looked 
inevitable 
for 
the 

Michigan’s 
women’s soccer team.

After dominating Iowa (0-2 

Big Ten, 6-3 overall) in all aspects 
of the game, a failure to convert 
on scoring chances appeared to 
have doomed the Wolverines in 
a game that should have gone in 
the win column.

But with a minute remaining, 

senior 
defender 
Christina 

Murillo launched a cross from 
the left side of the box to the 
back post. It was a routine 
play that Michigan had tried 
countless times in the previous 
89 minutes, never successfully.

This time, senior forward 

Lulu Haidar got her head on 
the ball, sending it just over the 
Iowa goalkeeper’s hands. It gave 
Michigan the lead and, a minute 
later, the win. The victory 
sealed a weekend sweep for the 
Wolverines after they defeated 
Nebraska 2-0 on Friday. 

“We 
need 
to 
finish 
our 

chances earlier in the game,” 
said sophomore forward Taylor 
Timko. “We should have had 
finished earlier. But we stayed 
composed, kept playing and 
thank God for Lulu.”

For the previous 89 minutes, 

Michigan (2-0, 7-3) controlled 
the play, racking up 27 shots 
and 12 corner kicks. By contrast, 
Iowa attempted just three shots 
and one corner.

But as much as they controlled 

the ball, the Wolverines had a 
hard time finding the back of the 
net.

In the 52nd minute, Timko 

sprung loose in the Iowa box, 
beating her defender down the 
left side. Her shot flew just wide 
of the near post. Of Michigan’s 
seven shots on goal, four were 
straight at the Iowa goalkeeper’s 
chest.

In the 87th minute, sophomore 

forward 
Ani 

Sarkisian sent 
a 
hard 
shot 

from the top 
of the box just 
over the right 
corner of the 
goal.

“I’m 

disappointed 
in 
the 
way 

we took our 
chances,” said Michigan coach 
Greg Ryan. “We won’t win much 
in the Big Ten without scoring. 
We’re lucky we finally found 
one.”

Set pieces were no different 

for the Wolverines, who failed 

to score on a corner or free kick 
all weekend, despite the high 
number of chances. Michigan 
tried a variety of different 
plays on corner kicks, but none 
provided any change in result.

“We’ll do a lot of work 

on 
finishing 
(in 
practice),” 

Ryan said. “We created the 
opportunities, and when we’re 
getting the kicks and headers, 
they’ve gotta go in.”

In 
Friday 

night’s 
game 

against 
Nebraska 
(0-1, 4-3), the 
Wolverines 
once 
again 

controlled 
possession, 
winning 
the 

shots 
battle 

24-8 
and 

attempting 12 corners to the 
Cornhuskers’ two. 

Unlike Sunday, they found 

the back of the net early. It took 
just six minutes to score, as 
Timko got behind the Nebraska 
defense, received a pass from 

Murillo on the left side of the goal 
and placed a shot to the far side of 
the net for the early lead.

One minute later, Michigan 

struck again. Murillo cleared 
the ball from the Michigan half, 
and a fortuitous bounce off a 
Nebraska defender put the ball on 
Sarkisian’s foot directly in front 
of the goal. She knocked it under 
the goalkeeper, and suddenly the 
Wolverines were up, 2-0.

The score held for the rest 

of the game, as Michigan let 
off the gas offensively and 
stifled the Cornhuskers. Strong 
team defense kept the ball in 
the Nebraska half, and when 
the Cornhuskers did get their 
chances, freshman goalie Sarah 
Jackson was up to the task.

“I thought our whole team 

defending was fantastic,” said 
Ryan. “We’re rock solid in the 
defending category and had some 
outstanding plays on that side.”

Despite the issues with putting 

the ball in the net, the Wolverines 
escaped with a weekend sweep 
and dominated in all other 
aspects of play.

Michigan’s perfect 
start comes to end

By TYLER SCOTT

Daily Sports Writer

Ending the non-conference 

season 
without 
a 

loss would 
have 
been 
an 

impressive 
feat for the No. 20 Michigan 
volleyball team, which had been 
off to its best start since 2011.

The 
Wolverines 
(10-1) 

traveled to take on Duke and 
North Carolina in the Big Ten/
ACC Challenge, where Michigan 
was defeated by the Tar Heels, 
3-0 (18-25, 7-25, 19-25), in 
Sunday’s matchup for its first 
loss of the season.

“We knew there was certain 

things that (North) Carolina 
likes to do,” said Michigan coach 
Mark Rosen. “We made really no 
adjustments to make changes to 
try and affect them. So we kind 
of let them do what they do best.”

The loss came after Michigan 

swept Duke, 3-0 (25-19, 25-20, 
25-21) Saturday to extend its 
then-perfect record.

With his team trailing early in 

the first set against Duke, Rosen 
was forced to call a timeout. The 
Wolverines responded with a 
10-1 scoring run that built up a 
strong lead. The offense seemed 
to be running out of gas again 
as the Blue Devils (5-4) tried to 
rally, but another timeout and 
set of adjustments from Rosen 
led to Michigan sealing the first-
set victory.

“Even though we defended 

really well (against Duke), I 
didn’t think the rhythm of our 
offense was very good,” Rosen 
said. “We just didn’t have the 
tempo and rhythm we normally 
have.”

Key efforts against the Blue 

Devils came from sophomore 
outside hitter Adeja Lambert, 

who had five of Michigan’s first 
10 kills and finished with a team 
high of 13. Sophomore defensive 
specialist Caroline Knop had 10 
digs to go with five kills.

Senior 
middle 
blocker 

Krystalyn Goode contributed 
with six kills and two blocks, as 
Michigan held on to win, despite 
the issues.

Sunday 
against 
North 

Carolina, more frequent lapses 
in play proved too costly, as the 
Tar Heels (3-7) were too much 
for Michigan to handle.

Despite thier losing record, the 

Tar Heels have been competitive 
in 
matches 
against 
seven 

different ranked opponents so 
far this season, and they are still 
receiving votes in the American 
Volleyball Coaches association 
poll, making their victory over 
the Wolverines less of an upset 
than their record would suggest. 

Against 
Michigan, 
North 

Carolina dominated the first two 
sets before clinching the win. 
Tied 11-11 in the third set, the 
Tar Heels eventually wore down 
the Wolverines and won the 
third set and the match, 25-19.

“We knew they were capable 

of that,” Rosen said. “They 
haven’t played that well much 
this year, and tonight they did. 
Give them all the credit, they 
played extremely well. I think 
had we played our best match 
(Sunday), it would have been a 
dogfight. The frustrating part 
for us is that we really didn’t give 
ourselves that opportunity.”

Rosen wasn’t happy with the 

weekend’s performance, but was 
optimistic about the Wolverines’ 
ability to curtail future miscues 
as Big Ten competition begins.

“I’m confident with this team,” 

Rosen said. “I think this team 
has a high ceiling. I think that 
we still have a ton of room to get 
better, which is encouraging. It’s 
exciting. But, you never know.”

Wolverines control 
Northwestern, 3-0

By AZALEA HINOJOSA 

Daily Sports Writer

Last week’s defeat against 

Detroit 
didn’t seem 
to have any 
lingering 
effect on the Michigan men’s 
soccer team when it took on 
a 
bigger 
challenge 
Sunday 

afternoon: Northwestern.

The Wildcats were expected 

to be a stronger opponent than 
the Titans, but the Wolverines 
were quick to set a dominant 
tone in their conference home 
opener. 

From the start, Michigan took 

control of the ball, dominating 
the field with its agile footwork, 
speed and aggression. Ninety 
minutes later, the Wolverines 
(1-0-1 Big Ten, 3-2-1 overall) had 
outshot Northwestern, 28-11, in 
a 3-0 victory that marked the 
program’s 150th win.

Freshman midfielder Francis 

Atuahene 
played 
a 
critical 

role in the victory. His fancy 
footwork 
stole 
the 
show, 

helping him move swiftly past 
defenders to take nine shots 
on goal. When senior forward 

William Mellors-Blair took a 
shot that was redirected by 
the Northwestern goalkeeper, 
Atuahene reacted and quickly 
made contact with the ball in 
midair, sending it straight into 
an empty net.

With the score at 1-0, the 

Wildcats’ offense fought hard 
for the ball. But the Wolverines’ 
defense bested Northwestern’s 
attack 
with 
a 
number 
of 

turnovers.

In the 35th minute, redshirt 

sophomore Michael Kapitula 
scored Michigan’s second goal 
fresh off of the bench with an 
assist by Mellors-Blair.

The second half saw an 

aggressive 
approach 
by 
the 

Wildcats (1-1-0, 2-3-1), as the 
pressure to score became more 
intense 
with 
each 
passing 

minute. Northwestern had one 
silver lining when sophomore 
defender Billy Stevens initiated 
a scuffle against the Wildcats’ 
Mike Roberge and was issued a 
yellow card.

After colliding with Michigan 

sophomore 
goalkeeper 
Evan 

Louro, Roberge was forcefully 
pushed further back into the 
goal by Stevens. The nearby 

players from both teams then 
rushed into the net in an attempt 
to separate the two.

“These guys are competitive,” 

said Michigan coach Chaka 
Daley. “They’re fighting for 
everything … protecting our 
players. 
I 
wouldn’t 
expect 

any less than for them to be 
brothers.” 

Already up 2-0, Michigan had 

no problem putting the tension 
aside and it helped fifth-year 
senior Colin McAtee focus in to 
score the team’s third and final 
goal, assisted by Atuahene.

Freshman 
midfielder 
Ivo 

Cerda also showed glimpses 
of good things to come. His 
physical dominance on the field 
allowed him to keep the ball 
under Wolverine control for the 
majority of the game. 

After the unexpected loss to 

Detroit, Michigan could have 
played in the same manner 
against 
Northwestern, 
but 

bounced right back instead.

 “I thought we had a really 

good game as a team,” Kapitula 
said. “If we can keep this energy 
and the style that we brought 
today, we’re going to be a really 
dangerous team.”

Michigan cruises to two wins

By TYLER COADY

For the Daily

With experienced forwards 

like Sina Lampe and Shannon 
Scavelli 
leading the 
way for the 
Michigan 
field 
hockey 
team, it has 
not been easy for freshman Lydia 
Sydnor to get involved in the 
early part of the season.

But on Friday, the young 

forward 
turned 
a 
match 

against No. 18 Penn State into a 
breakout performance. She was 
a constant threat to the Nittany 
Lions’ defense and even drew 
the game’s first penalty corner, 
which resulted in a goal to help 
the Wolverines (1-0 Big Ten, 6-2 
overall) to their first win of the 
weekend. Michigan maintained 
its lead for the rest of the game, 
beating Penn State, 3-1.

After scoring the game’s first 

goal, the Wolverines continued 
to ramp up the pressure, but were 
stifled on numerous occasions 
by Penn State goaltender Jenny 
Rizzo. The Nittany Lions (0-1, 
2-4) responded to the attack by 
forging some dangerous chances 
of their own. Penn State came 
close on a penalty corner, but 
sophomore 
goaltender 
Sam 

Swenson made a swift save to 
keep the Nittany Lions at bay.

With just three and a half 

minutes left in the first half, the 
Wolverines scored off of another 
corner. Ellis passed the ball to 
sophomore 
Katie 
Trombetta, 

whose shot was deflected, but 
Lampe tucked away the rebound 
to give Michigan a 2-0 lead going 
into the half.

The Wolverines pushed their 

shot count to 17 in the second 
half, making things difficult for 
the Penn State defense, but the 
Nittany Lions’ offense started to 
work hard, too. With just under 
16 minutes left, Penn State’s 
Shay Cannon rocketed one past 
Swenson to cut the Michigan lead 
in half.

Just as it seemed Penn State 

was 
going 
to 
make 
things 

interesting, 
Michigan 
senior 

defender Lauren Thomas took 
a pass from Ellis off the penalty 
corner and deposited it in the net. 
With that goal, the Wolverines 
silenced Penn State and closed 
things out for their first Big Ten 
win of the season.

“Being Penn State and the fact 

that we always play them hard 
and tough, the whole atmosphere 
before the game [motivated] us to 
play our best game,” Sydnor said.

Speaking 
after 
the 
game, 

Michigan coach Marcia Pankratz 
was quick to praise the whole 
team’s effort, especially that of 
her freshman class.

“They all came in super fit, 

fast and smart, and that is why 
they are Michigan Wolverines,” 
Pankratz said.

Michigan 
maintained 
its 

weekend dominance on Sunday, 
cruising to a 3-1 victory over Kent 
State (1-6 overall).

In a game in which the 

Wolverines outshot the Golden 
Flashes, 15-5, the defensive unit 
for Michigan shone once again, 
even with the absence of Ellis 
through injury.

“We have been training really 

hard on our one-on-one defense,” 
Thomas said. “It has just been 
something that we work on all 
the time … and it is just something 
that we really pride ourselves 
on.”

Even 
with 
the 
staunch 

defensive effort, the offense 
was not overshadowed, as the 
Wolverines scored early on. With 
just under 11 minutes played, 
junior 
forward 
Allie 
Sardo 

converted a Michigan penalty 
corner.

Then, 
with 
Michigan 

dominating and halftime nearing, 
Kent State’s Madison Thompson 
took the ball in the circle, twirled 
around two Wolverine defenders, 
and put it past Swenson to tie the 
game at one.

But that was it for the Golden 

Flashes, 
as 
the 
Wolverines 

responded with two quick goals 
to take a 3-1 lead.

It was a comfortable weekend 

for the Wolverines, but with Big 
Ten matchups coming up against 
Maryland and Rutgers, Michigan 
will look to maintain its defensive 
consistency and offensive prowess.

the Wolverines and the team’s lon-
gest run since 2012. Isaac ended up 
leading all Michigan rushers with 
114 yards on eight carries.

Meanwhile, 
led 
by 
senior 

defensive end Mario Ojemudia, 
the defense made eight tackles 
for loss and forced two intercep-
tions. It was the most tackles for 
loss for Michigan since Nov. 8 of 
last season.

“We want to play our game, 

play Michigan football,” Ojemu-
dia said. “Our game is aggressive, 
getting to the ball, hitting people 
in the mouth, all of the above.

“I don’t like to talk about last 

year too much, but I don’t remem-
ber us getting anything … just 
getting the ball back is our motto, 
and it was good to see that today.”

A different kind of highlight 

came in the beginning of the 
fourth quarter, however, when 
senior fullback Sione Houma 
leaped over the offensive line for 
his first-career touchdown. After 
an official review on the previ-
ous play took away his moment, 
Houma was delighted with the 
second chance.

“There’s no feeling like scor-

ing your first touchdown at the 
Big House on your home turf,” 
Houma said. “I just lay there 
and tried to take in the moment. 
Thank God, He’s the one that 
brought me along and built me up 

to be this fullback I am right now.”

On the subsequent drive, UNLV 

pieced together a 75-yard drive to 
put a sudden end to the shutout. 
Whether it was a gambler’s falla-
cy or sloppy play by Michigan, the 
Wolverines weren’t happy.

“We want to play up to our 

expectations, not our opponents, 
and giving up that touchdown 
late was unacceptable,” Ojemudia 
said. “I think it’s completely fair 
of how we expect to play. … They 
shouldn’t have gotten anything.”

Nonetheless, the cards fell in 

Michigan’s favor in the end, and 
the Rebels were forced to fold.

“I would never use the word 

‘satisfied’ in a football sense,” Har-
baugh said. “But yes, I’m happy. … 
It feels good to get a team win.”

Five Things We 
Learned: UNLV

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

The Michigan football team 

earned 
another 
unexciting 

victory.

For the second straight week, 

the Wolverines rolled to an 
easy win at Michigan Stadium, 
this time against UNLV, 28-7. 
Michigan plowed through the 
Rebels’ defense for 254 rushing 
yards, 6.5 per carry. Though 
two long plays provided a few 
fireworks, the ground game again 
featured mostly short runs up the 
middle, while the defense stifled 
UNLV to protect a comfortable 
lead.

While 
Saturday’s 
game 

unfolded in a similar fashion to 
last week’s, the Wolverines did 
unveil some new wrinkles in 
moving to 2-1 on the season.

Here are five things we learned 

from Michigan’s win:

1. Michigan has a running 

back 
situation, 
if 
not 
a 

controversy

After the game, Michigan 

coach Jim Harbaugh refused 
to 
acknowledge 
a 
running 

back controversy between the 
Wolverines’ ball carriers.

“It’s as clear as I can tell you,” 

Harbaugh said. “The more good 
players that we can have, the 
better for our football team. 
We’re encouraging that as much 
as we possibly can, and our 
players are responding to it.”

Still, 
Saturday’s 
game 

considered, 
Michigan 
has 
a 

decision at the very least.

Junior De’Veon Smith headed 

into the day as the clear No. 1 
running back after rushing 23 
times for 126 yards against Oregon 
State. But Smith couldn’t get 
going against UNLV, totaling just 
33 yards on 13 carries. Midway 
through the third quarter, his 
last two runs were stopped at the 
line of scrimmage on 3rd- and 
4th-and-1 from the UNLV 36-yard 
line. 
Redshirt 
junior 
Drake 

Johnson and junior Ty Isaac — 
who ran for a 76-yard touchdown 
in the second quarter — took over 
the workload from there.

Johnson 
and 
Isaac 
both 

dwarfed Smith in yards per carry, 
perhaps giving themselves an 
opportunity to see more playing 
time moving forward. Smith 
still received as many carries as 
Johnson and Isaac combined, 
though, and he’ll likely be the 
starter again next week. But 
Harbaugh and the staff proved 
they aren’t afraid to feed the hot 
hand, so Johnson or Isaac could 
see their numbers called again at 
some point.

2. The Michigan secondary 

might finally be worth fearing

The Wolverines have insisted 

they’ve seen their defense force 
loads of turnovers in practice, 
just not in games yet. Losing the 
turnover battle likely cost them 
the game at Utah in the season 

opener.

So they made it a goal to 

change that Saturday against an 
overmatched UNLV team, and 
they accomplished it.

“You’ve got to have that, or 

the (opposing) offense has no 
fear when it comes to throwing 
the ball,” Harbaugh said. “The 
more you can get your hands on 
the football, the tighter you make 
the quarterbacks throw, and the 
execution and the timing has got 
to be really good by an offense. 
Can’t just feel like they can throw 
it into your secondary with no 
consequences.”

3. Jake Rudock’s turnover 

problem is not yet solved

Michigan 
passing 
game 

coordinator Jedd Fisch said 
Wednesday that if Rudock could 
just string together a few games 
with no interceptions, he could 
bring down his average from two 
per game, where it was last week.

Rudock 
is 
now 
averaging 

fewer than two, but he did throw 
his fifth pick of the year against 
UNLV, bringing him to his 
2014 season total at Iowa. This 
one came early in the second 
quarter with Michigan ahead, 
14-0. Redshirt freshman Jabrill 
Peppers had just returned a punt 
24 yards to the Michigan 48-yard 
line, so the Wolverines had a 
short field to build on their lead.

Redshirt 
freshman 
Wilton 

Speight has come in to run out 
the clock in each of the past two 
weeks, so Michigan’s apparent 
plan is to redshirt junior Shane 
Morris and stick with Rudock. 
That said, Rudock will have to 
limit his miscues going forward 
in order for the Wolverines to 
keep winning.

4. John Baxter’s methods 

are showing progress

Harbaugh brought the highly-

respected Baxter to Ann Arbor to 

manage the special teams after a 
year off last season. Michigan’s 
unit was average at best in 2014.

Baxter’s coaching appears to 

be showing results, though they 
might be small. The Wolverines 
were within inches of blocking 
multiple punts against Oregon 
State, and the effort was more 
tangible this week. Peppers broke 
six tackles on his 24-yard punt 
return — for context, Michigan 
had 13 returns for 88 yards all of 
last season.

5. Bold Prediction: Peppers 

will score a touchdown in the 
next two weeks.

Peppers 
drew 
tremendous 

hype as a five-star defensive back 
recruit last year, most notably a 
comparison to Charles Woodson. 
To be fair, it was probably 
unrealistic to expect a player to 
make significant contributions in 
all three phases of the game as a 
freshman.

Peppers 
brought 
Michigan 

fans back down to Earth after 
he injured his ankle early in the 
season, playing in just three 
games.

But he has returned to form 

this year, proving that the 
hype was warranted. He has 
started every game at safety and 
been an asset to the Michigan 
secondary, so there’s always the 
small possibility he could run 
back an interception. He has 
been the Wolverines’ most active 
playmaker in the return game. 
Though he has been forced to 
call for several fair catches, he 
has a 36-yard kick return and 
Saturday’s electrifying 24-yard 
punt return.

And it wouldn’t be a shock to 

see him on offense when Big Ten 
play starts Oct. 3 — no one in the 
program has ruled it out.

There’s 
a 
big 
difference 

between almost running a kick 
back and actually doing it, but 
Peppers is getting closer.
