During the winter months 
many students can face the pos-
sibility of seasonal affective dis-
order, a mood disorder causing 
depression to occur at the same 
time every year. While most 
people experiencing SAD feel 
the effects from late fall to the 
end of winter, in a rarer form, 
people can experience SAD 
from late spring to early fall.
Vicki Hays, senior associate 
director of the University of 
Michigan’s Counseling and Psy-
chological Services, says CAPS 
treats SAD as a facet of depres-
sion.
“Seasonal 
affective 
disor-
der is considered a part of the 

overall umbrella of depression,” 
Hays said. “Primarily, I think 
you would notice that unlike 
your normal state of being, you’d 
feel more lethargic, less inter-
ested in things, maybe not able 
to concentrate as well, lots of 
our basic symptoms of depres-
sion. And it’s not a great com-
bination to have that and have 
all the school stuff going on this 
time of year.”
Jim Dolan, the clinical direc-
tor of CAPS, said although there 
may be an increase in students 
with SAD during the winter 
months, CAPS does not keep 
track of SAD-specific changes.
“I can tell you that about 22 
percent of our students report 
depression as their primary pre-
senting concern,” Dolan said. 

“But we really don’t differenti-
ate between types of depres-
sion.”
Hays echoed his statement, 
saying depression is the second 
largest most common reason 
students go to CAPS for help, 
with anxiety being the first. 
Hays could not confirm if there 
is an increase in students going 
to CAPS during the winter.
“I don’t think so,” Hays said. 
“I have to say we’re fortunate 
that the students find us to be 
helpful and we have tons of stu-
dents who come in. So we don’t 
necessarily track that data.”
Dolan 
also 
stressed 
the 
importance of understanding 
the difference between when 
someone may have depression 
and when the weather is just 

affecting their mood.
“It’s important for people 
to understand there’s a differ-
ence between the weather just 
kind of affecting your mood 
and the normal things we feel 
as human beings when the 
season changes, versus when 
something becomes depres-
sion, which is a more serious 
matter,” Dolan said. “It’s pretty 
normal for people to want to 
stay in bed a little more, or to 
raise carbohydrate foods and 
things like that. But it’s when it 
starts to interfere with your life 
— like you can’t get out of bed 
or you stop attending events or 
you don’t go to classes — that’s 
when depression can be a real 
problem.”

Roundtable 
discusses 
the state of 
journalism

Panelists talk experience 
with suppression and 
violence in SE Asia

Around 30 people showed up 
to the Perspectives on the State 
of Journalism panel Wednesday 
evening to hear three panel-
ists, each representing different 
Southeast Asian countries, speak 
on their experiences as journal-
ists.
The event started with each 
speaker 
talking 
about 
their 
career and works focusing on 
Southeast Asia before moving 
into a Q&A session with the audi-
ence. Documentary filmmaker 
Orlando de Guzman explained 
his work in the Philippines, 
describing his experience film-
ing police violence and civilian 
murders following the election 
of President Rodrigo Duterte in 
2016.
“Soon after he was elected, 
I went immediately back to 
the Philippines because I felt it 
would be a rather big change in 
society,” de Guzman said. “The 
usual night beat reporters who 
cover crime would go out and 
there would be at least two dozen 
killings a night we wouldn’t even 
spend time in one place before 
we’d have to run off to another.”

At 
the 
“Empowering 
Survivors: A Forum on Sexual 
Misconduct 
Policy” 
panel 
Wednesday night about 100 
students gathered at the Ford 
School to discuss the new 
sexual misconduct policy at the 
University of Michigan.
The panel was held by 
Central Student Government 
and guests from the Office 
for Institutional Equity, the 
Sexual Assault Prevention and 
Awareness Center, the Office 
of Student Conflict Resolution, 
the department of sociology 
and 
Kroll

Title IX regulation changes 
and campus issues relating to 
sexual misconduct and survivor 
empowerment.
CSG Vice President Isabel 
Baer, an LSA junior, highlighted 
the findings from the campus 
climate 
survey 
on 
sexual 
misconduct, which found 11.4 
percent of students, 22.5 percent 
of undergraduate females and 
6.8 percent of undergraduate 
males were survivors of sexual 
assault at the University.

On Wednesday night, around 
80 students gathered in the Tau-
ber Colloquium to discuss the 
history of power, privilege and 
stereotypes as a person of color. 
Spearheaded by the United Asian 
American Organization, the panel 

was a coalition of four POC orga-
nizations on campus: UAAO, Black 
Student Union, La Casa and Arab 
Student Association. The panel 
featured faculty advisors and staff 
in multicultural leadership roles 
throughout campus. 
Titled “Beyond Black and White: 
Marginalized Identities in Aca-
demia”, Business senior Chandra 

Sahu told The Daily after the event 
that she thinks it’s unique to cam-
pus.
“I haven’t seen a collaboration 
with organizations of these identities 
in all of my four years,” Sahu said. “I 
think it’s easy to feel that there is a 
divisiveness between different kinds 
of students of color so it’s nice to have 
a reminder. Because coalition build-

ing is how change happens.”
Robert Sellers, Chief Diversity 
Officer and vice provost for Equity 
and Inclusion, served as the moder-
ator and began the event by discuss-
ing the need for solidarity among 
people of color.

LSA program associate Elizabeth James speaks to the audience about discrimination and stereotypes at the Beyond Black and White panel in 
the Tauber Colloquium Wednesday evening.

On 
top 
of 
attending 
classes and fulfilling other 
typical 
college 
related 
responsibilities, Engineering 
junior Sara Bashir runs and 
operates 
her 
own 
mini-
business. Using her Ann Arbor 
apartment 
as 
a 
makeshift 
salon, Bashir provides lip and 
eyebrow threading services 
to students. Her prices range 
from approximately $2-$10, 
depending on the treatment. 
Eyebrow 
threading 
is 
the 
most expensive service she 
provides. 
Bashir’s 
interest 
in 
threading began long before 
she launched her business, 
back when she was in middle 
school.
“My mom knew of the 
concept (of threading) because 
it’s kind of cultural for Desi 
people and people from South 
Asia to thread … so I just tried 
it,” she said. “In middle school, 
I started by threading my leg or 
my arm or my mom’s arm and 
then I did their faces and then 
when I got more confident I 
started doing other people.”

GroundCover is joining street 
papers across the globe, as well as 
sister papers in Detroit and Tra-
verse City, to celebrate Interna-
tional Vendor Appreciation Week 
Feb 3 through 10. The annual 
celebration commemorates over 
9,000 street newspaper vendors 
worldwide.
GroundCover is a local news-
paper sold and written by low-
income and homeless people in 

Washtenaw County. GroundCov-
er vendors buy newspapers as in-
dependent contractors of the non-
profit to sell to pedestrians in Ann 
Arbor and neighboring locations.
Susan Beckett, publisher of 
GroundCover News, started the 
company nine years ago when 
she saw a need in the community 
after the 2008 recession. In the 
past, GroundCover has celebrated 
International Vendors Apprecia-
tion Week by inviting community 
members to open houses or selling 
newspapers with local communi-

ty and government members. This 
year, Beckett says, they decided to 
try a different approach.
“As we were planning for this 
week this year, a couple vendors 
said that they want to celebrate 
by spreading awareness about 
the city paper and showing the 
community to know that selling 
GroundCover is legitimate work,” 
Beckett said.
Lit Kurtz, who lost her teaching 
job in Detroit during a large layoff 
of approximately 4,000 teachers 
in 2012, discovered GroundCover 
after she was evicted from her 
house and left without perma-
nent housing.
Kurtz saw this vending op-
portunity as a business introduc-
tion and potential for financial 
growth. Since 2014, she has been 
writing and selling Ground-
Cover newspapers, and has been 
vocal about how this industry 
has changed her life. Kurtz says 
there are difficulties in securing 
a job when permanent housing 
is unavailable, and GroundCov-
er gives work to persons in the 
midst of housing issues.
“When you are living home-
less or without conventional 
housing, you’re living without 
access to showers, laundry, stor-
age, which means you can’t al-
ways be presentable as you’d like 
for a job interview or for holding 
down a mainstream job,” Kurtz 
said. “So GroundCover meets 
you where you’re at — on the 
street — and puts something in 
your hands that you can sell to 
the public.”
Kevin Spangler, owner and 
founder of Boober Tours, a local 

pedicab service that works with 
recovering drug addicts, was a 
vendor for GroundCover News 
before he molded their business 
model into his own local vending 
service.
Spangler believes in a second-
chance job philosophy, providing 
work for those who may not be 
able to obtain work because of 
their personal history. Spangler 
also provides programs for recov-
ering employees to enroll in, and 
says vending services give produc-
tive opportunities to people strug-
gling in the community.
“I think the vendor’s impor-
tance is that we are contributing 
something positive to the commu-
nity,” Spangler said. “We are pro-
viding a positive newspaper and 
we’re not just asking people for 
money. We’re at the level of trying 
to get back on our feet. Same thing 
with Boober Tours — I structured 
my business like GroundCover, 
creating a second-chance job for 
people in recovery.”
Hussain Ali, LSA senior and 
president of Michigan Move-
ment — a student organization 
focused on providing aid and 
relief to people experiencing 
homelessness in Ann Arbor and 
Washtenaw County — has been 
working to spread awareness 
about GroundCover.
Ali says GroundCover adds 
an important aspect to the com-
munity, and provides meaningful 
content to the community while 
simultaneously creating cohesion 
among the public.

THREADING
From Page 1

Engineering senior Anna 
Learis agreed, noting she has 
noticed some of her friends 
suffering more from actual 
clinical depression during 
the winter, while some may 
just be feeling more down. 
Learis is the co-founder and 
editor in chief of Mental-
ity Magazine, which aims 
to increase discussion about 
mental health by provid-
ing a platform for students 
to share their mental health 
experiences through writ-
ing.
“I have quite a few friends 
or acquaintances with things 
that are more along the lines 
of clinical depression, and 
obviously that gets worse,” 
Learis said. “But also with 
people who usually don’t 
have 
any 
mental 
health 
issues, when it’s this cold, 
you don’t go outside, you’re 
not socializing, you know, 
you stay in bed all day. And 
although that’s fun every 
now and then, you just get in 
such a slump, and especially 
in Michigan, I think it’s hard 
for students to get out of that 
slump.”
As a result, CAPS has 
established Wellness Zones 
on campus. Wellness Zones 
come equipped with mas-
sage chairs, yoga mats with 
meditation videos and artifi-
cial full spectrum light ther-
apy lamps, which are used to 
alleviate SAD.
However, there are cur-
rently no Wellness Zones 
available for undergraduate 
students to use. The Well-
ness Zone for Central Cam-
pus has been temporarily 
closed and put into storage 
because of construction on 
the Michigan Union, and is 
slated to return in the winter 
2020 semester. A new one is 
coming soon to North Cam-
pus in collaboration with 
the 
Engineering 
Student 
Government, but has not yet 
opened. Graduate students 
can use the Wellness Zone in 
the Munger Graduate Resi-
dences.
For those struggling with 
SAD or feeling the effects 
of the cold on their mental 
health, Learis recommend-
ed the sun lamps for light 
therapy and reaching out to 
friends to leave the house 
more often during the win-
ter.
“One of our writers tried 
(light therapy lamps) out 
for two weeks and told us it 
changed her mood complete-
ly,” Learis said. “And then I 
tried it out and was like, “Oh 
my gosh, this works.” And 
going along those lines, I 
think one thing that comes 
up a lot when I talk to peo-
ple about seasonal affective 
disorder is a lot of it kind of 
all rotates back to cutting 
yourself off socially … so 
another thing is reaching out 
to friends and making plans 
that force you to leave the 
house to still engage.”
Hays also recommended 
light therapy lamps and get-
ting natural light outside in 
her advice to students.
“Spend 
time 
outside, 
regardless of how cold it 
is,” Hays said. “Even if it’s 
cloudy, the rays seem to come 
through in a way that lifts 
the spirits. Trying to main-
tain a regular sleep habit, 
trying to get outside even if 
it’s walking outside instead 
of taking a car. Spending 
more time outside than they 
might normally think about 
doing in the winter.”
While CAPS provides a 
multitude of resources for 
students on campus, some, 
like Learis, still bring up the 
issue of long waiting times 
for appointments.
Learis said the issue of 
long waiting times can be 
detrimental for people who 
need help immediately, but 
acknowledged 
that 
this 
problem has been alleviated 
slightly within the School of 
Engineering.
“If someone’s having an 
issue, they want to talk now, 
not in two and a half weeks,” 
Learis said. “So I think until 
they get more rotating coun-
selors, that’s a major issue. 
And fortunately, the Col-
lege of Engineering has two 

embedded 
CAPS 
counsel-
ors, so a lot of my Engineer-
ing friends have said that 
they’ve seen improvements 
in scheduling times since it’s 
happened, but I think that’s 
the exception.”
According to Dolan, CAPS 
is on track to see about 2,500 
students this semester, con-
tinuing a trend of substan-
tial increases each semester 
for the past several years. 
However, the CAPS staff is 
at full capacity for their bud-
get, so he said the possibil-
ity of increasing the number 
of counselors and available 
appointments is not likely.
“We are fully staffed for 
the funding that we have,” 
Dolan said. “It is a challenge, 
and I’ll be honest as the clin-
ical director, it’s very chal-
lenging right now to meet 
the needs of all the students 
who come to CAPS.”
LSA senior Jordan Laza-
rus is the executive direc-
tor of Wolverine Support 
Network, an organization 
sponsored by CAPS offer-
ing weekly peer-facilitated 
support groups as well as bi-
weekly community events. 
Although he too has heard of 
the long waiting periods for 
CAPS appointments, Laza-
rus said they are still able to 
provide far more resources 
than other colleges he has 
worked with through WSN.
“Like 
everything 
else, 
there’s a finite amount of 
resources and I wish there 
was more,” Lazarus said. 
“I don’t run CAPS, but they 
exist to serve students. And I 
know that compared to a lot 
of campuses that I do inter-
face with, CAPS here is real-
ly 50 steps ahead. But yeah, 
there are waiting times, and 
it is a problem.”
On 
long 
waiting 
lists, 
Dolan 
emphasized 
initial 
consultations 
are 
usually 
within a few days and CAPS 
provides a counselor on duty 
every day for walk-in meet-
ings.
“Now that (walk-in meet-
ings) is a first-come, first-
served service, so sometimes 
students might have to wait 
to see the counselor on duty, 
but we have counselors on 
duty to see someone every 
day,” Dolan said. “The wait 
times might come in later 
on when people are actu-
ally engaged in counseling 
because we have so many 
students that are interested 
in 
individual 
counseling. 
Again, we do our best to 
see students right away, but 
there might be some waits in 
terms of actually engaging 
with the counselor.”
Learis 
also 
recognized 
improvements 
in 
student 
resources when it comes to 
mental health and highlight-
ed the growth in student 
organizations advocating for 
mental health.
“I think this might… be 
because I’ve gotten more 
involved with the mental 
health community over my 
time — but I see so many 
organizations 
doing 
such 
great work,” she said. “From 
CAPS in Action to CSG’s 
Mental Health Task Force 
to Mentality Magazine. So I 
feel like the conversation is 
more frequent about men-
tal health, even if we aren’t 
necessarily 
getting 
more 
resources. 
More 
people 
know they can say, ‘I’m not 
having a good mental health 
day.’”
For emergencies, Learis 
recommended 
the 
CAPS 
24-hour hotline as well as 
the University’s Psychiatric 
Emergency Service hotline. 
Finding a shared experience 
with someone else, Lazarus 
says, could make all the dif-
ference in getting better.
“Talk about it,” he said. 
“Everyone 
— 
seriously, 
everyone — is going through 
something. And I believe 
from a peer support side, 
just knowing that there’s 
someone who you can relate 
to and empathize with, you 
know like, ‘We both get SAD 
in the winter.’ Just to feel 
that sense of connection and 
shared humanity is really 
powerful, and can really, 
really help.”

According 
to 
de 
Guz-
man, 
covering 
the 
events 
in the Philippines became 
more difficult following the 
widespread attention of the 
killings. He also expressed his 
overarching concerns report-
ing the Philippines’ political 
situation.
“As the months went on as 
more and more international 
attention was put on the kill-
ings 
and 
as 
international 
criticism rained down on all 
of this, it became harder and 
harder to do our work,” de 
Guzman said. “It got to a point 
where police stopped shar-
ing information with us about 
where killings were taking 
place.”
De Guzman went on to 
stress the dangers of journal-
istic work in the Philippines.
“Looming over everything 
is that fact that the Philip-
pines is still probably the most 
dangerous place for journal-
ists working in areas outside 
of a war zone,” de Guzman 
said. “I wish I could be more 
positive by where things are 
going in the Philippines right 
now, but I feel that’s a bit pre-
mature.”
Panelist 
Arlyn 
Gajilan, 
Reuters deputy managing edi-
tor, went on to present and 
discuss a video of two Reuters 

journalists captured in Myan-
mar while covering the killing 
of 10 men. Gajilad said the sit-
uation highlights the dangers 
of journalism in violent areas.
“Despite 
our 
size 
and 
influence, we are like any 
other journalist working in 
a country where people are 
oppressed,” 
Gajilad 
said. 
“They are subject to the same 
kind of dangers, and thats 
whats happened here.”
Gajilad said many people 
fail to recognize the true 
impact of violence towards 
journalists.
“It’s easy to think of them as 
journalists, it’s kind of a nice 
safer road,” Gajilad said. “But 
then journalists are people 
too, with families and chil-
dren and ties to the local com-
munity so there is a human 
toll.”
As the final speaker, Tyrell 
Haberkorn, Southeast Asian 
studies professor at the Uni-
versity of Wisconsin, Madison, 
focused mainly on the state of 
reporting and voice suppres-
sion in Thailand. Haberkorn 
highlighted 
the 
reasoning 
behind the concern of freedom 
of expression to oppressive 
regimes in Thailand.
“Why are dictators so afraid 
of freedom of expression and 
what do they do when they’re 
afraid,” 
Haberkorn 
said. 
“They’re afraid their mis-
deeds will become uncovered, 

they’re afraid that upon seeing 
this information, citizens will 
become subjects, not objects, 
and they will rise up.”
A fourth speaker, photo-

journalist Hkun Lat, was sup-
posed to speak but could not 
attend due to issues obtain-
ing a visa, according to Allen 
Hicken, political science pro-
fessor and moderator of the 
event.
In the Q&A section, audi-
ence 
members 
asked 
sev-
eral questions regarding the 
effects social media poses 
on journalism in Southeast 
Asia. According to Haber-
korn, social media sites such 
as Facebook provide both a 
positives and negative impact 
for citizens looking to freely 
express their views.
“Facebook is both a tre-
mendous platform for disso-
nance and to call for action,” 
Haberkorn said. “But it is 
also a place of great danger 
largely because of those who 
are accused of imposing the 
monarchy have been accused 
on the basis of Facebook 
posts.”
AJ Vicens, audience mem-
ber and Knight-Wallace fel-
low, said he is happy there are 
people who bring these South-
east Asian issues to light on 
campus.
“Clearly journalism is a 
troubled institution around 
the world,” Vicens said. “To 

hear from these people their 
perspectives on what’s hap-
pening in Southeast Asia is 
just so important and I’m glad 
there are people paying atten-
tion to all that’s going on over 
there.”
De Guzman said issues are 
faced by journalists all over 
the world, and the issues may 
increase before the problem 
can be solved.
“We are seeing a kind of 
really rising populism and mix 
of nationalism in the country, 
a mix of white nationalism,” 
de Guzman said. “I feel there 
are more and more dangers 
now 
that 
journalists 
face, 
especially those who have to 
be there where things are hap-
pening, and it might get a lot 
worse before it gets better. It’s 
an exciting time to be a jour-
nalist but it’s also getting to be 
extremely dangerous.”
Vicens said he hopes view-
ers leave with respect for 
journalists who work in a dan-
gerous time.
“Reporters are putting their 
lives on the line, quite literally 
to get truth out in these coun-
tries,” Vicens said. “It’s very 
difficult work, it’s not very 
appreciated in a lot of places. 
In the face of such opposition 
from the community, the gov-
ernment and security forces 
they are doing such hard work 
and people should respect 
that.”

COMPLE X RHY THMS DANCE SHOW

ASHA LEWIS/Daily
The University of Michigan Department of Dance rehearses for their annual show opening at the Power Center this Thursday.

During high school, Bashir 
began to thread her friends’ 
facial hair, which is where 
she got the inspiration to 
continue 
her 
pastime 
in 
college.
“In high school, I started 
threading 
my 
friends 
— 
literally in the middle of 
class I would thread them,” 
she said. “One of my teachers 
said ‘You should go to college 
and be your dorm’s eyebrow 
threading girl or your hall’s 
eyebrow 
threading 
girl,’ 
but, at the time, I thought 
that it would never actually 
happen.”
Bashir 
explained 
she 
had no initial intention of 
turning this hobby into her 
own personal, student-run 
business. In fact, she simply 
continued to thread for her 
friends’ benefit.
“Originally, (at Michigan), 
I was just doing it to thread 
my friends if they ever 
needed 
to 
be 
threaded,” 
Bashir said. “I just kept 
threading my friends and it 
just kind of grew by itself. 
I didn’t have to do a whole 
lot.”
Once 
Bashir 
began 
charging 
people 
for 
her 
services, she began to amp 
up 
her 
marketing 
skills 
beyond 
word 
of 
mouth, 
she 
explained. 
She 
also 
created a digital flyer, which 
circulated various student-
related social media groups.
“At some point last year, 
I started to put up posters 
in the UGLi and around my 
dorm,” Bashir said.
LSA sophomore Annika 

Dhawan, one of Bashir’s 
current customers, said she 
discovered Bashir’s business 
through her digital flyer on 
Facebook.
“I first heard about her 
before I came to school,” 
Dhawan said. “I remember 
someone posting ‘Looking 
for 
recommendations 
for 
threading 
and 
waxing 
services, etc.,’ and then I 
remember seeing someone 
posting her flyer in one of 
the comments and a lot of 
people were paying attention 
to that. When I was actually 
looking for someone during 
the year I consulted that 
post.”
Dhawan 
explained 
she 
decided to use Bashir instead 
of a local threading business 
because of her prices and 
convenience.
“Because she is a student 
herself I feel that her prices 
are a lot more reasonable 
for students and it’s really 
accessible,” Dhawan said. 
“Last year she was running 
her services out of her room 
in Alice Lloyd, and it was 
pretty convenient to make a 
trip over there.”
Public policy junior Arwa 
Gayar 
also 
discovered 
Bashir’s threading business 
through social media.
“I found out about it 
through 
MSA 
(Muslim 
Student Association), so the 
Muslim girls on campus have 
kind of like a mass chat on 
WhatsApp and I remember 
I saw a flyer on there about 
threading services and I 
needed to get my eyebrows 
done, so I contacted her,” 
she said.
Gayar explained she chose 
to use Bashir’s services not 
explicitly for convenience or 

price, but primarily because 
she felt more confident in 
Bashir’s threading ability 
considering her heritage.
“I 
have 
pretty 
thick 
eyebrows 
and 
there’s 
a 
certain style that I like and 
a lot of times salonists will 
not know how to do my 
eyebrows how I like them,” 
Gayar said. “I trusted her 
more because it’s kind of a 
community thing that Desi 
girls and Arab girls struggle 
with their eyebrows and 
because 
she 
knows 
the 
struggle, I trusted her more 
to do my eyebrows how I like 
them.”
Many customers not only 
appreciate Bashir for her 
actual threading services, 
but also for the comfortable 
experience she provides.
“She has made a very 
comforting 
environment 
for everyone who goes to 
her and anyone who wants 
the service done,” Dhawan 
said. “She always makes 
her little set up very homey 
and 
really 
comfortable 
and familiar. People not 
only find it convenient and 
accessible but also just very 
comfortable and a nice safe 
place to go.”
Gayar echoed this opinion, 
adding Bashir has fostered a 
sense of community through 
her services as well.
“It’s comforting to know 
that I can go to this girl’s 
apartment and know that 
she is going to do a good 
job instead of going to some 
random salon,” she said. “I 
think (Bashir’s business) is 
also important just because 
eyebrows have kind of been 
like a common theme among 
Muslim girls … (they are) 
a constant struggle and so 

it’s kind of a unifying thing 
that you can provide for 
your community even when 
it’s something as simple as a 
basic service.”
Bashir donates a portion of 
her profits to local charities. 
She explained she wanted 
her business to have a larger 
impact.
“When I started charging 
people in college, I wanted 
to do something with (the 
money) 
… 
so 
I 
started 
to donate 30 percent of 
the proceeds to different 
charities,” she said.
Bashir said she wanted 
to be intentional about her 
donations.
“I usually send the money 
to charities I have personal 
ties to,” Bashir said. “In high 
school, I worked a lot with 
the Muslim Center Soup 
Kitchen in Detroit. … I also 
give it to Syrian Refugees … 
who have been relocated to 
my hometown and around 
Detroit. 
I 
actually 
also 
always ask my appointments 
for suggestions about where 
they 
would 
want 
their 
money going, but for the 
most part it’s soup kitchens 
and refugee charities.”
While 
Bashir 
said 
the 
most 
important 
part 
of 
the business for her is the 
charitable aspect, she also 
appreciates the community 
it has provided her, as well 
as her customers.
“The 
biggest 
thing 
is 
that I’m doing something 
because 
I’m 
donating 
to 
charities,” Bashir said. “But 
in terms of my daily life, it’s 
nice because I get to meet a 
lot of new people … (and with 
that), I get to know what’s 
going on around campus.”

A

fter several years of 
growing 
unrest 
and 

widespread 
protests, 

tensions in Venezuela finally 
boiled over at the start of this 
year. To begin, the immensely 
unpopular 
president 
Nicolas 

Maduro was re-elected in 2018 
through 
an 
allegedly 
rigged 

vote. In the wake of his 2019 
inauguration, 
the 
National 

Assembly 
of 
Venezuela, 

believing Maduro’s election to be 
illegitimate, invoked articles 233, 
333 and 350 of the Venezuelan 
Constitution, allowing them to 
render the presidential position 
empty and confirm Juan Guaidó 
instead, setting the stage for a 
dramatic battle over presidential 
authority. While there has been 
an outpouring of support for 
Guaidó in the weeks since his 
confirmation, not many concrete 
changes have occured, leaving 
Venezuela in a state of great 
uncertainty going forward.

In a situation with so much 

up in the air, looking at similar 
situations from recent history 
can be the best way to try and 
determine what comes next. 
Thanks to several key factors, 
including military backing, the 
role of foreign intervention, and 
how far leaders are willing to go 
to stay in power, recent uprisings 
have had three distinct outcomes: 
transitions of leadership with 
government reforms, increased 
oppression 
and 
a 
greater 

concentration of power, or civil 
war.

For 
Venezuela, 
the 
ideal 

outcome is a relatively orderly 
transition 
which 
ends 
with 

Maduro conceding power to 
Guaidó without violence. While 
this is far from guaranteed, there 
is still some historical evidence 
it is possible. In 2011, Tunisian 
citizens 
launched 
massive 

protests against President Zine 
El Abidine Ben Ali, a revolution 
which bears similarities to the 
situation in Venezuela today. 
Similar to Maduro, Ben Ali faced 
protests fueled by economic 
instability and allegations of 
corruption (Ben Ali had been in 
office for more than 20 years, 
routinely threw dissenters in 
jail, and often won elections with 
more than 90 percent of the vote).

Facing nationwide protests, 

Ben 
Ali 
was 
ultimately 

overwhelmed and fled to Saudi 
Arabia in January. In October 
2011, the country held free 
elections, and while Tunisia 
still has many issues to work 
though, the 2011 transition has 
undeniably improved Tunisian 
politics. Crucially, the military 
showed relative restraint during 
the protests, which was a crucial 
component of the revolution’s 
success. In Venezuela today, 
the military still backs Maduro, 
though one high-ranking official 
has already declared support for 
Guaidó. Additionally, as protests 
go on, there are reasons for the 
military to flip.

Maduro 
cannot 
rely 
on 

issues like racial identity to keep 

the army behind him, as some 
leaders like Syrian President 
Bashar al-Assad have been able to 
do. Maduro must also be wary of 
foreign intervention, especially 
from the United States, where 
remnants of Cold War anti-leftist 
sentiment make Venezuela a 
target.

While examples like Ben Ali’s 

overthrow in Tunisia provide 
hope, a positive outcome is 
far from assured. An uprising 
could also be quelled, allowing 
Maduro to remain in power 
without 
conceding 
anything 

to his opposition. For example, 
protests erupted in Bahrain in 
2011 as part of the Arab Spring. 
The 
country’s 
Shia 
majority 

wanted equality and greater 
political freedom. In response 
to the uprising, the Sunni king, 
Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, used 
Saudi Arabian troops to brutally 
suppress 
the 
protests, 
even 

killing 
several 
people. 
After 

declaring martial law and a state 
of emergency, Hamad remained 
in power, squashing the chance 
for a regime change.

The most prominent recent 

example of an uprising backfiring 
in this manner was in Turkey 
in 2016, when a small faction 
from 
the 
Turkish 
military, 

known as the Peace at Home 
Council, attempted to overthrow 
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. 
In response to the uprising, 
Erdogan’s regime arrested more 
than 40,000 people and labeled 
a leading critic of Erdogan, 
Fethullah Gülen, a terrorist.

While the Bahraini uprising 

is obviously not identical to 
Venezuela, Hamad and Maduro 
have one commonality which 
helps 
strengthen 
established 

regimes: They are willing to 
greatly infringe upon citizens’ 
rights to maintain their power. In 
addition to the army, Maduro is 
also backed by the Special Actions 
Force, or FAES, a group of largely 
untrained government loyalists 
who have no reservations about 
attacking or even outright killing 
dissenters. In the long term, a 
relatively small force of untrained 
radicals is not enough military 
support to sustain power, so it is 
important for Maduro to retain 
the support of the military if he 
wants to stay in power.

Looking beyond the violence, 

Maduro could also spin foreign 
support 
of 
Guiadó 
into 
an 

“us-against-them” narrative to 
try and create national unity. 
Additionally, Maduro has been 
accused of corruption several 
times, and it is important to 
consider there may be high-
ranking 
government 
officials 

involved who would actively 
benefit from Maduro retaining 
power.

Ultimately 
though, 
while 

Erdogan may have been able to 
spin his attempted overthrow 
into increased authority, there 
is no guarantee it would be 
as effective for Maduro. The 
protests in Turkey had nowhere 
near 
the 
popular 
support 

Guiadó has, and many foreign 
governments 
condemned 

the uprising, saying they felt 
it 
disrespected 
democratic 

institutions in Turkey. While 
violent repression of protests is 
often effective when support for 
the opposition is limited, using 
violence against huge masses 
of people is often an exercise in 
futile cruelty which does little 
but draw international ire.

Using 
violence 
against 

large groups of people may be 
an exercise in futile cruelty, 
but it doesn’t mean it’s never 
been done before — sadly, it 
leads to the third outcome of 
popular uprisings: civil war. On a 
simplistic level, the most notable 
contemporary civil wars, fought 
in Syria and Yemen, both began 
when massive anti-government 
movements 
were 
met 
with 

widespread violence. In Syria, 
people flooded the streets to 
show their opposition to Bashar 
al-Assad as part of the Arab 
Spring in 2011. Assad refused to 
back down and responded with 
incredible violence against his 
own citizens, leading to a civil 
war that has killed and displaced 
hundreds of thousands of people.

In 
Yemen, 
the 
Houthi 

movement, 
which 
supports 

former President Ali Abdullah 
Saleh and refuse to recognize the 
authority of current President 
Abd Mansur Hadi, violently 
took the capital city of Sana‘a in 
2015, leading to an ongoing civil 
war. Thankfully, it is extremely 
unlikely the dispute in Venezuela 
will spiral into anything as 
violent as the wars in Syria 
and Yemen. In Syria, Assad has 
violated human rights to a truly 
extreme degree.

While Maduro may use some 

violence 
against 
dissenters, 

Assad’s extreme measures are an 
outlier, and not representative 
of how most leaders handle 
uprisings. In Yemen, the rebel 
Houthi movement is comprised 
of armed attackers, not peaceful 
protesters, 
and 
the 
conflict 

has worsened by attacks from 
terrorist groups like ISIS, as 
well as the United States, Saudi 
Arabia and Iran all using it 
as a proxy war. Venezuelan 
opposition has, thankfully, been 
peaceful, so escalation into a 
military civil war is extremely 
unlikely. 

To conclude, it’s remarkable 

how profoundly the next few 
months could shape the future 
of Venezuela. There are still a 
great number of questions left to 
answer, leaving the world with 
nothing to do but speculate and 
hope for the best. Thankfully, 
it is unlikely Venezuela will 
go down the path of bloody 
civil war. However, who is 
ultimately able to retain power 
is still unknown. Hopefully, the 
situation concludes peacefully 
and Venezuela can move forward 
once again.

A butterfly’s fight

A

s a child I remember aimlessly 

running through my yard 

in constant pursuit of the 

graceful butterflies that fluttered their 

wings only a fingertip away from 

my youthful reach. My intent 

was never malevolent — quite the 

opposite. I yearned for a butterfly 

to latch onto my hand so I could 

mesmerize myself with its colors.

Though I am far removed 

from my backyard adventures, 

butterflies continue to be an 

emblem for my life and the lives 

of 
others, 
as 
they 
represent 

hope, 
display 
grace, 
denote 

beauty and symbolize freedom. 

Unfortunately, during the summer 

of 2017 in Mission, Texas, these 

dignified 
creatures 
became 

entangled 
with 
the 
Trump 

administration’s effort to move 

forward with construction of a 

wall for increased border security.

In July 2017 at the North 

American Butterfly Association’s 

National Butterfly Center, the 

director 
Marianna 
Treviño-

Wright 
confronted 
chainsaw 

wielding construction workers. 

The workers were tasked with 

demolishing the building and the 

landscape Wright and her team 

worked so diligently to create 

and preserve. This confrontation 

precipitated 
a 
legal 
battle 

between the Center and the 

Trump administration, in which 

the 
administration 
ultimately 

prevailed.

Trump eventually enforced 

eminent domain (the government’s 

power to take private property 

for public use) and waived 28 

environmental protection laws 

to take over NABA’s private 

property in order to expedite 

the construction of his infamous 

wall. Now, in the coming weeks, 

200,000 square feet of the National 

Butterfly Center is scheduled 

to be bulldozed. Four-hundred 

endemic and migratory species 

of butterflies are at risk if we do 

not rally and act in their support. 

Butterflies are too fragile to fight 

for themselves, and thus the fate 

of their beauty, grace and hope 

depends on the determination of 

engaged citizens.

The fight is especially salient 

because butterflies are ecologically 

pertinent to healthy ecosystems 

as they are an indicator species, 

meaning they provide evidence of 

a healthy environment. However, 

butterflies do not merely indicate 

health in an ecological scope, 

but their natural beauty is a 

microcosm of the health of society.

On an ecological level, the 

proposed border wall will divide 

the National Butterfly Center, 

leaving an estimated 70 percent of 

the land on the Mexican side of the 

wall. This physical partition poses 

a threat, as the butterflies will be 

challenged to navigate the wall. 

This reduction in viable land will 

lead to fewer resources for animals 

and catalyze the bottleneck effect 

which will weaken the butterflies’ 

genetic pool and decrease their 

population.

For more than 15 years, the 

National Butterfly Center has been 

a lush area of vegetation drawing 

flocks of wildlife and tourists 

alike, to witness the vibrant 

environment. 
This 
raises 
the 

question: Will people at the border 

realize that any day they may see 

their last butterfly all due to the 

construction of a border wall?

I fear this wall will slowly strip 

away the hope of a sustainable 

future, the strength to fight and 

the beauty of the world, much 

like the Holocaust did to poet 

Pavel 
Friedmann. 
Friedmann 

wrote “The Butterfly,” a poem 

which 
profoundly 
encapsulates 

hope while incorporating despair 

during his encampment in the 

Theresienstadt concentration camp 

and ghetto. His poem discusses the 

last butterfly he saw. The butterfly 

was “dazzlingly yellow,” but after a 

short stay “it went away.”

The creation of the infamous 

wall will leave a permanent scar 

on our landscape. Butterflies are 

simply a precursor to the greater 

tragedy that is unfolding due to the 

environmental follies perpetuated 

by the Trump administration and 

its unprecedented desire to fulfill 

one of its many campaign promises 

at all costs. The construction of 

this small portion (38 miles) of 

the border wall will require the 

removal of over 30 million square 

feet 
of 
vegetation, 
vegetation 

situated on public land that is 

ultimately paid for by our taxes and 

therefore owned by the people.

President Trump is neglecting 

our wildlife, our backyards and 

our 
environmental 
health 
in 

pursuit of a wall that will only 

lead to larger ladders or deeper 

tunnels. Trump, on behalf of the 

butterflies and all other animals 

subject to the ramifications of 

the proposed border wall, should 

remove and recognize the impact 

of his decisions. This wall will 

stand far beyond his term, and 

will stand as a monument to 

hate, bigotry and environmental 

destruction. 

Ultimately, 
the 
border 

wall is not constrained to just 

environmental 
ramifications. 

It also is an emblem of anti-

immigration. Immigrants hope 

for a better future and have the 

strength to risk their lives in 

pursuit of happiness and embody 

the beauty of the promise upon 

which our country was formed.

This principle was best put 

forth by the poet Emma Lazarus 

in her poem forever emblazoned 

on our Statue of Liberty, “The 

New Colossus”: “Give me your 

tired, your poor, your huddled 

masses yearning to breathe free, 

the wretched refuse of your 

teeming shore. Send these, the 

homeless, tempest-tost to me, I 

lift my lamp beside the golden 

door!”

I refuse to accept a person 

may see their last butterfly in 

response to ethnic tension and 

the fallacious misconceptions 

perpetuated 
by 
Trump 
in 

his 
pursuit 
to 
degrade 
the 

immigrants yearning to be free. 

I patiently await the day I can 

watch my kids running around 

a field chasing butterflies to 

experience their beauty first 

hand. I fear, however, that his 

wall — if constructed — leaves 

our country less vibrant, hopeful, 

beautiful and free. I fear I will 

never watch my children chase 

butterflies.

Where does Venezuela go? Look at the past to find out

A

s a little girl, I was 
something of a tomboy. I 
played jackpot in the mud 

at recess, and my Christmas wish 
lists consisted of baseball mitts and 
remote controlled cars. Skirts were 
my mortal enemy, and, much to 
my parents’ chagrin, I was always 
unbearably uncooperative at the 
mall. While I have incredibly 
fond memories of those times, my 
adolescent years were also haunted 
by a dark secret — I was a Twihard.

I distinctly remember watching the 

first “Twilight” movie and gawking 
at Bella and Edward’s forbidden love 
and Edward’s mysterious disposition. 
But to those who knew me — or so 
they thought — “Twilight” was just 
a stupid movie. Bella was boring, 
Edward’s sparkly skin was absurd 
and their romance was over-the-top 
cheesy. After the second movie came 
out and the world divided itself into 
Team Jacob or Team Edward, my guy 
friends and I judged the “obsessive” 
fans with disgust. Little did they know, 
I was a closeted Edward supporter.

As a disclaimer, I have since 

grown up to realize the many flaws 
in the “Twilight” franchise and the 
problematic power dynamic between 
the two main love interests. That 
being said, “Twilight” fans have faced 
a uniquely harsh judgment in our 
society, and a lot of it has nothing to do 
with these flaws. For whatever reason, 
the franchise has become the poster-
child of anti-intellectual, unartistic, 
cinematic garbage. Even as a little girl, 
I knew that if I wanted respect from 
my male friends, I had to join the camp 
that disdained the vampire-obsessed 
girls. I couldn’t be seen as a member 
of Team Edward because everyone 
knew that the people who bothered 
themselves with that nonsense didn’t 
know “good” film.

“Twilight” is an extreme case, but 

it is certainly not the only example of 
a franchise whose fan base receives 
frequent criticism and judgment. 
In middle school, it was “Pretty 
Little Liars,” “Gossip Girl” and “The 
Vampire Diaries.” In college, it’s 
“Grey’s Anatomy” and “The Bachelor.” 
It’s no secret that all of these shows and 

movies share a common thread: Their 
target audience is female.

Yes, the criticism these shows 

and movies face is not entirely 
unfounded. 
Was 
“Twilight” 
a 

groundbreaking, 
Oscar-deserving 

film? Obviously not, but the degree 
to which our society loathes these 
particular shows and films is 
rooted in something more than 
just their lack of originality. It is 
rooted in a sexist attitude toward 
entertainment that goes almost 
entirely unrecognized.

Society spends far too much time 

judging works that target female 
audiences. Yes, when artists release 
a piece to the public, they must be 
prepared for strong opinions, and it is 
perfectly within the rights of the public 
to share their praises and criticisms. 
But among public reception of certain 
works, particularly in the film and 
television industry, is a commonplace 
contempt for those that target female 
audiences.

The judgment towards fanbases of 

traditionally considered “girly” works 
is dehumanizing. Girls are painted as 
irrational and foolish for succumbing 
to the appeal of drama, romance and 
fantasy. They lose credibility and 
respect merely for enjoying certain 
forms of entertainment. Moreover, the 
girls who take part in the judgement of 
those who like such works earn praise 
for managing to “rise above” their sex’s 
tendency to gravitate toward such 
primitive cliches.

For some reason, when girls 

enjoy “Twilight,” their lack of taste 
is irreconcilable, but there is no 
such equivalent in entertainment 
that targets a more traditional male 

audience. In fact, when girls like these 
traditionally male-targeted films, it is 
seen as an impressive display of good 
taste. If you like “Twilight,” you’re 
irredeemable, but if you like “Star 
Wars,” you’re a game changer.

We 
all 
know 
the 
popular 

complaint against shows like “The 
Vampire 
Diaries” 
and 
“Grey’s 

Anatomy.” 
They’re 
repetitive, 

predictable and overly dramatic, and 
those that enjoy such entertainment 
simply have no taste. While these 
series receive a seemingly constant 
stream of backlash, television shows 
and films like “Criminal Minds” 
and the millionth installment of 
“Mission Impossible” that cater to 
a more general or male audience 
receive virtually no such criticism. 
Yes, sometimes we make fun of 
these works for being repetitive and 
predictable, but nobody is shouting 
that those who enjoyed them are 
intellectually inferior.

The fact of the matter is, 

franchises 
earn 
success 
with 

unoriginal work because there are 
certain tropes, that, no matter how 
overused, pique our interest. Nobody 
is watching “Mission Impossible” 
expecting a life changing viewing 
experience. We watch because it’s 
entertaining to see Tom Cruise 
save the world with some last ditch 
effort, even if it is for the seventh 
time. Similarly, girls don’t watch 
“Twilight” seeking enlightenment. 
They watch because forbidden love 
and vampires are exciting.

There is a disturbing double 

standard in public reception of film 
and television, and it is reflective 
of a greater societal perception of 
traditional femininity. Succumbing 
to conventionally “girly” norms is 
not a bad thing. There is nothing 
inherently 
worse 
about 
liking 

“Twilight” than there is about liking 
any other cliche action film, and our 
punishment as “Twilight” fans has 
lasted far too long. It’s time we let it 
go.

Meghan Beaubien, perhaps, 
knows better than anyone.
“We graduate one and bring in 
another,” the sophomore pitcher 
said Tuesday evening.
Four-year 
starting 
first 
baseman and veteran pitcher, 
Tera Blanco, has left a void in the 
No. 19 Michigan softball team’s 
rotation and batting order. While 
most softball programs are able 
to rely on a rotation of two or 
three strong pitchers, Blanco’s 
graduation has left Beaubien 
the sole pitcher 
with significant 
experience 
returning 
this 
spring.
Beaubien 
started 
her 
college 
career 
with a bang last 
year – playing in 
over 50 games 
and 
pitching 
three complete-
game 
no-hitters 
— 
earning 
both the Big Ten Freshman and 
Pitcher of the Year titles.
“Sometimes it’s really hard 
to come back from a really great 
season,” said Michigan coach 
Carol Hutchins. “I think that’s 
probably 
Meghan’s 
biggest 
challenge.”
Not only will Beaubien face 
high expectations this year, but 
she will also face off against 
opponents who know how she 
pitches.
“Everyone 
prepares 
for 
the opponent’s best pitcher,” 
Hutchins said. “There’s a lot of 
scouting out there on her and 
we asked her to come back with 
better spin. Spin the ball, break 
it more and obviously mix it up a 
little more.”
Of course, Beaubien won’t 
have Blanco alongside her in the 

rotation, either. The physical 
exhaustion of playing so many 
consecutive innings, potentially, 
took its toll on Beaubien as her 
performance began to falter in 
the last few games of the season. 
In the last five games of the 
year, Beaubien had a 3.19 ERA, 
more than two points above her 
season average of 1.16. That is one 
mistake the Wolverines do not 
want to repeat.
“If I had my wish, I’m hoping 
for a good step-up pitcher,” 
Hutchins said. “We have our 
sights set on Alex Storako, a 
freshman. We think she’s going 
to give us some 
innings, 
some 
really 
good 
innings.”
Added 
Beaubien: 
“I 
spend a lot of time 
with 
(Storako) 
as pitchers. She 
stands 
out 
to 
me, 
personally. 
I think she’s got 
a lot of passion 
and fight in her. She’s a very hard 
worker. She’s very driven. I know 
pitching that Alex will definitely 
have an impact. ”
Though both pitchers have 
been 
training 
side-by-side 
all year, they each bring very 
different skill-sets to the mound. 
While Beaubien focuses on speed, 
Storako is more of a spin pitcher.
“I like (Storako’s) moxie,” 
Hutch said. “I like her presence 
on the mound. She’s a totally 
different pitcher from Beaubien. 
I like the fact that they’re so 
different.”
The 
pitching 
rotation 
is 
rounded 
out 
by 
sophomore 
pitcher Sarah Schaefer, who 
ended 
last 
season 
with 
26 
appearances and a 1.57 ERA. How 
many innings these two will take 
off Beaubien’s hands is unclear at 
this point.

“We need some innings from 
Sarah Schaefer,” Hutchins said. 
“We definitely need her to give 
us some innings. How much 
is yet to be determined. She’ll 
determine that when she gets her 
opportunities.”
Blanco’s presence won’t just be 
missed on the mound, but also at 
the plate. The graduated senior 
led the Wolverines last year, 
both with 44 runs batted in and 
a .495 on-base percentage. The 
Wolverines will have to adapt 
their offensive strategy in the 
coming season.
“Tera was a huge bat,” Uden 
said. “I’m interested to see how 
we will adjust to it. I think there’s 
a little bit of a different dynamic. 
She had a little bit more power. I 
think our girls this year are line-
drive hitters. We’re going to get 
a lot of bases. Tera got us a lot of 
runs but we’re going to go base to 
base this year I think. 
“I’m not so sure if anyone’s 
going to fill her role, but we’re 
going to pick up in areas where it 
will fill the gap.”

Staring at your own imminent 
successor would stir conflicting 
feelings for most. For Katie 
Alexander, it’s her day job.
Now in her third season as the 
No. 19 Michigan softball team’s 
starting catcher, the senior has 
established herself as one of the 
best backstops in the conference. 
Last season, she slugged her way 
to a .314 batting average and 24 
runs batted in while picking up 
All-Big Ten Second Team honors 
as a junior.
Though this weekend’s Wilson-
DeMarini Tournament will mark 
the beginning of Alexander’s 
final chapter, Alexander is more 
focused on her role in writing 
the first chapter of freshman 
catcher Hannah Carson’s much-
anticipated career.
Perhaps 
much-anticipated 
is an understatement. Carson 
— FloSoftball’s No. 21 2018 
prospect — verbally committed to 
Michigan coach Carol Hutchins 

during December of eighth grade. 
Five years later, the Weidman, 
Michigan native tallied a .571 
batting average and 31 home runs 
as a senior in high school en route 
to her fourth consecutive All-
State First Team selection.
To Alexander, leadership is 
more important than numbers.
“I take pride in being (a mentor) 
because I want to leave the 
program better than I found it,” 
Alexander said. “That’s something 
I’ve always wanted to do. I know 
that’s something I’ve done so far 
this year (with Carson), but really 
want to help her understand how 
it all works and make sure she’ll 
be able to lead just like I’ve been. 
She’s an amazing player, and she’s 
obviously been catching for a long 
time.”
Today, Carson is the rookie 
that Alexander once was. But at 
the end of the day, mentoring the 
program’s next catcher seems 
more like glancing in the mirror 
than teaching an outsider.
“I see myself in her,” Alexander 
said. “I’ve watched videos of 

myself hitting while she’s catching 
and I think, ‘Am I catching? Is 
that me?’ She pays attention to 
detail, and I think she’s going to 
do really well because she already 
has the physical stuff. Now it’s 
about the mental game — getting 
in there, getting reps and knowing 
the speed of the college game.”
When the Wolverines take the 
field this weekend, they’ll see No. 
7 Arizona and No. 5 Florida on the 
other side of the diamond. With 
an early opportunity to capture 
two statement victories, Hutchins 
knows her newcomers will have to 
contribute immediately. Michigan 
returns seven starters from last 
year’s Big Ten championship 
team, meaning Hutchins will have 
to call upon a pair of freshmen 
or 2018 reserves for a spot in the 
starting lineup.
Though 
Alexander 
has 
established 
herself 
as 
the 
Wolverines’ starting catcher and 
a staple in the heart of the team’s 
batting order, Carson’s presence 
can spark mutual growth for both 
catchers.
“It’s my goal to give (freshmen) 
as much of an opportunity 
as 
possible,” 
Hutchins 
said. 
“Hannah Carson looks up to our 
senior catcher tremendously, and 
I think our upperclassmen have 
really been great mentors for 
these guys, really showing them 
the ropes. Katie’s totally helping 
Hannah get ready, but Hannah 
really needs some playing time so 
she can give Katie some rest and 
get ready for the future. You never 
know when the future’s going to 
show up.”
Regardless of how the playing 
time is split, 2019 has the potential 
to be a special year behind 
the plate in Ann Arbor. With 
Alexander’s career set to come 
full circle, perhaps there isn’t a 
more fitting way to leave a lasting 
legacy than by setting an example 
for her successor.

Wolverines finding footing heading into matchup against Nebraska

After 
notching 
two 
consecutive wins for the first 
time 
since 
November, 
the 
Michigan women’s basketball 
team (5-6 Big Ten, 14-9 overall) 
will host Nebraska (5-6, 10-12) 
Thursday night.
Nebraska has had an up-and-
down season, picking up big 
wins against ranked opponents 
such 
as 
Minnesota 
while 
dropping tight contests to lower-
tier squads such as Wisconsin. 
Junior guard Hannah Whitish 
leads the team with a scoring 
mark of 10.2 points per contest, 
and is efficient from beyond 
the arc, shooting the three 
ball at a 36.4 percent clip. The 
team’s best shooter from deep, 
however, is sophomore guard 
Taylor Kissinger, who shoots 
44.6 percent and converts 86.4 
percent of her free throws. 
Overall, the Huskers have eight 
players who score more than 
seven points a night and have 

plenty of weapons who can come 
up big any given night. While 
Nebraska is just 3-7 on the road, 
it could prove to be a pesky foe 
for the Wolverines, as many of 
their losses have been sealed in 
the game’s final moments.
On Jan. 27, a tough 77-73 
loss to Michigan State dropped 
the Wolverines to 3-6 in Big 
Ten play and put their NCAA 
Tournament 
hopes 
on 
life 
support. Michigan — as it has 
all season — found a way to fight 
back.
On the heels of securing 
victories over No. 17 Iowa and 
Wisconsin on the road, the 
Wolverines find themselves on 
the NCAA Tournament bubble 
(per ESPN), helping to make 
what was a pipe dream into a 
reality in just under two weeks.
A 
major 
catalyst 
for 
Michigan’s 
recent surge has come in the 
form of senior forward Nicole 
Munger. Munger, who suffered 
a 
seemingly-gruesome 
ankle 
injury in the team’s loss to 
Michigan State, returned for 

Friday’s game against Iowa. 
While she only scored eight 
and 10 points in each respective 
contest, Munger’s return has 
given the Wolverines new life 
heading into Thursday night. 
When discussing her star senior, 
Michigan 
head 
coach 
Kim 
Barnes Arico said that Munger 
has to be essential if Michigan 
is to qualify for the tournament.
“She is just everything for our 
program,” she said to WTKA 
Tuesday. “She just does all the 
little things because of her 
experience and how hard she 
plays.”
While Munger has garnered a 
significant amount of attention 
since her return, the Wolverines 
have received a nice boost 
from junior forward Akienreh 
Johnson, who scored 19 points 
in the win against Iowa and was 
a factor on defense in Sunday’s 
victory at Wisconsin.
“We knew (her breakout) was 
coming, we were just sitting on 
when,” Munger said on Friday.
Though its win against Iowa 

was big for its tournament 
resume, the Wolverines’ victory 
on the road against Wisconsin 
was important for a different 
reason. 
The 
win 
marked 
the 
team’s 
first 
victory 
in 
conference play on the road and 

helped Michigan clear one of its 
biggest hurdles.
While 
Thursday 
night’s 
contest will be played in Ann 
Arbor, Barnes Arico knows that 
the task of beating a Nebraska 
team that previously handed 

Michigan 
a 
70-56 
loss 
in 
December will still be a tough 
one.
“They’re just a really good 
team,” she said. “We gotta take 
advantage of having them at 
home.”

Despite being undrafted, Slaker seeks out NHL path in future

The path from college to the 
National Hockey League can 
take many forms.
Some 
skaters 
are 
highly-
touted prospects from their 
teenage years, become early-
round draft picks and see success 
at the collegiate and professional 
levels. Those transitions from 
one level to the next are seamless 
— 
think 
former 
Michigan 
forward Dylan Larkin.
Other 
players 
face 
more 
obstacles navigating the path 
towards living out their dreams.
For the past two summers, 
junior forward Jake Slaker has 
attended the Las Vegas Golden 
Knights’ 
development 
camp. 
 
NHL teams host development 
camps every summer as a means 
of evaluating young talent.
Slaker is tied for second on 
the Wolverines with 10 goals, 
tied for third with 10 assists 
and is third with 20 points. The 
alternate captain is currently 
undrafted, but like many players 
on the Michigan hockey team, he 
has NHL aspirations.
“(It’s) really since I picked 
up a hockey stick,” Slaker said. 
“You know you want to get to 
the highest level you can, and I 
didn’t start playing on the ice 
until I was eight years old. So, I 
think right when I changed to 
ice, it was a goal of mine that I 
wanted to fulfill. So right around 
that age when I switched to ice 
hockey from roller hockey.”
Slaker has the potential to one 
day play in the NHL. In his three 
seasons with the Wolverines, he 
has tallied at least 20 points each 
year, including leading the team 
with 21 points as a freshman. 
This season, he continues to be 
one of the main contributors on 
the offensive attack.
Having 
success 
at 
the 
collegiate 
level 
is 
not 
an 
automatic 
guarantee 
that 
a 
player will experience similar 
success 
at 
the 
next 
level. 
Conversely, putting up less than 
prodigious numbers in college 
does not mean a player cannot 

have a fruitful NHL career.
Michigan coach Mel Pearson 
knows 
this 
firsthand. 
The 
Wolverines have had their fair 
share of highly-touted draft 
picks don the maize and blue 
threads, like Max 
Pacioretty, 
Kyle 
Connor and Zach 
Werenski.
Being 
undrafted 
may 
have 
its 
perks, 
though, 
according 
to 
Pearson.
“When you’re 
drafted 
usually 
there’s just one 
team looking at you, but when 
you’re a free agent, you’ve got 31 

teams which I think is better,” 
Pearson said. “… And we’ve got 
a lot of good players and pro 
scouts here all the time. And 
that’s what happened to Johnny 
Madden. New Jersey came to 
watch 
Brendan 
Morrison 
because he was 
a second-round 
draft pick and 
they kept asking, 
‘Who’s this guy? 
Who’s this guy? 
Who’s this guy?’ 
and then ended 
up signing him 
after.”
Madden was a 
part of the 1996 team that won 
the NCAA Tournament when 

Pearson was an assistant coach. 
He went on to play on three 
Stanley 
Cup 
Championship 
teams after a two-year stint in 
the American Hockey League.
Pearson 
can 
see 
some 
similarities between Madden 
and Slaker.
“Johnny Madden was maybe 
one of the best (undrafted 
players),” Pearson said. “He 
wasn’t a big scorer when he was 
here and then obviously when 
he got to the NHL, he was put in 
more of a defensive penalty kill 
role. And that’s something like 
what Slaker could become at the 
next level. He might not be the 
big scorer but he’s someone that 
can kill penalties and add some 
offense.”

Slaker still has ways to go 
before making an NHL roster. 
And even further success at 
this level will not guarantee a 
prosperous professional career.
“I’ll give you a good example,” 
Pearson 
said. 
“Tony Calderone 
was a pretty darn 
good 
college 
hockey player. He 
had 25 goals last 
year and Dallas 
signed him. He 
played a little bit 
in their American 
League team and 
then 
gets 
sent 
down to the East 
Coast League. There’s a guy 
who put up 25 here and did (find 

success). And Cooper Marody — 
Cooper Marody lead our league 
(in scoring). He got a few games 
in the NHL but he’s down in the 
American Hockey League.”
Marody and Calderone were a 
pair of forwards 
that 
Pearson 
referred to as 
“usually the best 
players 
every 
night.” 
And 
though Pearson 
has 
confidence 
in 
his 
players 
— especially a 
player of Slaker’s 
caliber — it is 
clear 
that 
the 
junior must continue to develop.
“You’ve got to be a hard 
worker to play on that level at a 
consistent basis,” Pearson said. 
“And one of the things he’s got 
to continue to work on is his 
consistency and his play without 
the puck … I’m not saying he’s 
not going to but to me — come 
back and be an All-American, 
come back and dominate at this 
level.”
Slaker still has another year 
left of eligibility. But at the end 
of the day, he is an NHL free 
agent.
“It’s just a waiting process for 
(making it to the NHL) because 
I am a free agent,” Slaker 
said. “Teams will follow you 
throughout your college career 
and kind of give you calls or see 
you after a game and kind of 
just let you know their interest 
and talk to you at development 
camps. And when they think 
you’re ready to make the jump 
to the pros they’ll start to be 
serious about conversation and 
maybe offer you a contract and 
stuff like that. So, I think it’s just 
a waiting game and seeing what 
their interest level is.”
As Slaker and the rest of 
Michigan have their sights set on 
making an NCAA Tournament 
appearance 
for 
the 
second 
consecutive season, there is 
likely another thing that looms 
in the back of the minds many 
Wolverine skaters: their path to 
the NHL.

Many popular movie directors 
got their start in horror films: 
J.J. Abrams, Guillermo del Toro 
and James Cameron to name a 
few. In the film industry, horror 
is where many directors and 
producers begin to make a name 
for themselves. The same can be 
said for hip hop, as underground 
rappers debuted in the eerie, 
little-known subgenre that is 
horrorcore.
Marked by harsh, aggressive 
beats and over-the-top depictions 
of taboo subjects, horrorcore 
is hip hop’s foray into the 
supernatural. Often it was an 
outlet for their twisted fantasies. 
Drug abuse, slasher-style murder, 
mental derangement and satanic 
messages all found a home in 
horrorcore. Starting in the late 
’80s and early ’90s, the genre 
began to take shape, and its 
influence would run deep in hip 
hop for years to come.
Early 
horrorcore 
pioneers 
were some of hip hop’s greatest 
experimenters and influencers. 
The Geto Boys’s 1991 single “Mind 
Playing Tricks on Me,” widely 
hailed as one of the greatest hip-
hop tracks of all time, is a journey 
through paranoia that set the 
groundwork 
for 
horrorcore’s 
pervasive 
themes 
of 
mental 
illness. Three 6 Mafia were 
the first to introduce sinister, 
hardcore 
beats 
and 
satanic, 
occult-themed lyrics on their 1995 
debut album Mystic Stylez. Bone 
Thugs-N-Harmony followed suit 
on E. 1999 Eternal with ominous 
cuts like “Crept And We Came” 
and “East 1999.” All horrorcore 
needed was someone to bring all 
those elements together.

The album that started it all
The genre-defining moment 
came in 1996 with the release 
of 
Dr. 
Octagonecologyst, 
the 
otherworldly story of the alien 
gynecologist Dr. Octagon. The 
mad genius behind the record 
is Kool Keith, founder of the 
influential 
hip-hop 
group 
Ultramagnetic MCs, an artist who 
would go on to claim he invented 
horrorcore 
with 
the 
album’s 
release. He may not have invented 
horrorcore per se, but he definitely 
wrote the bible for it: Packed with 
disturbing rhymes and surreal 
messages, the tales of Dr. Octagon 
were the culmination of all prior 
experimentations in horrorcore.
I remember the first time I 
listened to Dr. Octagonecologyst, 

I 
was 
dumbstruck 
by 
its 
extraterrestrial 
imagery 
and 
deadpan non sequiturs. I knew 
I just listened to something 
brilliant, but I found it so 
unsettling that I didn’t revisit the 
record for over a year. Each time 
I went back, I left more confused 
about it than before — but I began 
to find comfort in the discomfort 
that is Dr. Octagonecologyst. I 
would not be the only Detroiter to 
feel that way.

In Detroit
The 
mantle 
of 
horrorcore 
has largely been taken on by a 
counterculture wave of Detroit 
artists associated with rap duo 
Insane Clown Posse (ICP) and 

their label, Psychopathic Records. 
ICP coined their own style of 
horrorcore in the mid ’90s focused 
on transgressive tongue-in-cheek 
lyrics. They maintain a dedicated 
base of “juggalos,” a nickname for 
ICP fans. Juggalos, a fringe group 
united by a shared love for ICP-
brand horrorcore, have developed 
their own culture: They wear 
clown makeup, share a common 
slang and find a catharsis in 
expressions of anger and violence. 
(Despite this, they are largely 
harmless and confine most of 
that expression to ICP’s elaborate 
concert theatrics and festivals).
Other Detroit artists have also 
taken influence from horrorcore. 
Legendary 
underground 
hip-
hop duo Binary Star included 
a horrorcore cut on their debut 
in 1999, “Wolf Man Jack.” More 
recently, rapper Danny Brown 

has flirted with horrorcore on his 
2016 album Atrocity Exhibition, 
which feels like the soundtrack to 
a Stephen-King-style funhouse.

In the Mainstream
Horrorcore 
has 
struggled 
to find mainstream success by 
nature of its lyrics and themes, 
but one Detroit horrorcore rapper 
launched his career as hip hop’s 
best-selling 
artist. 
The 
only 
exception who found mainstream 
success in horrorcore without 
watering down his lyrics is 
Eminem. Even at his most profane 
and terrifying on The Slim Shady 
LP and The Marshall Mathers LP, 
he shattered sales records and 
dominated the charts.
Since then, no other true 
horrorcore records have reached 
the 
mainstream, 
let 
alone 
replicating the enormous sales 
of 
Eminem. 
However, 
other 
mainstream artists have launched 
their careers with horrorcore 
and found success as their styles 
changed. Most notably, Tyler, 
the Creator built a fan base out of 
his first two albums, Bastard and 
Goblin, which were filled to the 
brim with disturbing, demonic 
depictions of rape, murder and 
mental illness.

Modern Influence
Today, artists from a range of 
genres still draw influence from 
horrorcore, usually in sonic style 
rather than lyrical themes. The 
shock factor of horrorcore has 
lost its charm to most listeners, 
but the eerie sound has inspired 
many. Grimes has cited the 
underground horrorcore group 
Jedi Mind Tricks as one of her 
influences. The blood-curdling 
screams and cackles on Kanye 
West and Kid Cudi’s 2018 album 
Kids See Ghosts are reminiscent 
of Dr. Octagonecologyst. Even 
Billie Eilish’s latest single, “bury 
a friend,” draws on the themes of 
horrorcore, though stripped of 
the gruesome lyrics central to the 
genre.
Horrorcore’s 
time 
in 
the 
limelight has faded since the days 
of The Marshall Mathers LP. The 
violent splatter-film-style lyrics 
may forever be a niche reserved 
for juggalos, but darker themes, 
hardcore beats and supernatural 
soundscapes are beginning to rear 
their head in hip hop once again 
with artists like Earl Sweatshirt 
and JPEGMAFIA. As rappers and 
producers continue to innovate 
new ways to scare listeners, 
they show just how deep their 
horrorcore influences run.

Horrorcore brings out the 
freaky side of hip hop, rap

RAP-A-LOT RECORDS

DYLAN YONO
Daily Arts Writer

Horrorcore 
is hip hop’s 
foray into the 
supernatural. 

Regardless of how seriously 
you take astrology, it’s a very 
useful tool for introspection 
and expression an effective 
means 
of 
understanding 
oneself and connecting with 
others. The same can be said 
for the clothes you throw on 
your back. Wearing your heart 
on your sleeve at any price 
point will pay off in the end 
because you allow others to 
understand who you are and 
find ways to connect with you, 
whether that means expressing 
how you’re feeling on that 
particular day or that each 
outfit you debut is a carefully 
constructed and consistently 
aligned expression of identity. 
Regardless of how much value 
you place on fashion, personal 
style is inescapable.
Astrology’s 
take-this-as-
far-as-you-want mantra lets 
you pull different elements 
of your life and relationships 
and create meaning, or just 
make a few tired jokes in 
attempt to disparage the two 
Scorpios in your life that 
crossed you (let them live, 
sweetie!). After reading your 
chart, some random sextile 
moons are going to strike a 
chord that resonates with you 
so profoundly that you’ll be 

on the floor fully gooped and 
riding through severe heart 
palpitations. Some are going 
to seem like they’re completely 
off (or are they?), and most 
people just look at their inner 
planets and end up saying that 
every sign’s overview is vague 
enough to relate to, which is 
kind of the whole point.
From 
entire 
maelstroms 
of 
online 
horoscopes 
in 
fashion magazines aiming to 
determine your personal style 
based on star signs to designers 
that build their brand around 
the energy and characteristics 
of a specific zodiac sign, 
the creative channels that 
stargazing has opened up for 
fashion are without bounds. 
The latter manifests itself best 
in Aries Arise, the brainchild 
of Sofia Prantera and Fergus 
Purcell, respectively of Silas 
and Palace Skateboards, and 
patches 
together 
elements 
from what they call “80s 
trash 
fashion” 
along 
with 
other 
high-energy 
stylistic 
movements that sought to 
burn bourgeoisie tastes to 
the ground, with refreshingly 
minimal 
and 
considered 
silhouettes.
Their self-aware engagement 
with the unsustainably fast 
paced world of streetwear, 
injecting bits and pieces of 
rave culture and grunge to a 

market that those movements 
were diametrically opposed 
to, is almost Foucauldian in 
nature and results in a sort 
of seductive, controlled pop 
of energy. The brand name is 
not just a smart-alecky play on 
words, it’s an encapsulation 
Aries is associated with a 
brash 
fearlessness 
and 
an 
unapologetic 
energy, 
their 
design ethos is to provide a 
vehicle for their customer base 
to tap into that through their 
wardrobe.
Horoscopes and natal charts 
become a powerful means of 
expressing identity in a world 
that pounds the masses with 
information, 
treating 
the 
individual as little more than 
an object of influence and 
transaction potential under 
the guise of connection and 
belonging. Entire cultures are 
blended into marketable drops 
of goo in the face of liquid 
modernity. Both bewitching 
and horrifying, it’s important 
to have something to hold 
onto when navigating through 
the 
world 
marketplace. 
If 
there is no other option than 
to operate as a consumer, we 
can at least consume in such 
a way that creates meaning 
in our everyday lives, the 
intersection between astrology 
and personal style provides a 
wonderful way of doing that.

“bury a friend”

Billie Eilish

Interscope Records

SINGLE REVIEW: ‘BURY A FRIEND’

Billie Eilish has the power 
to scare you shitless. She’s 
a 17 year old dichotomy, an 
essence of terror with a fairy-
like voice that’s softer than 
a breeze. Her new single 
“bury a friend” features her 
horrifying aspects as she steps 
into the realm of nightmares 
and the subconscious.
Eilish did in fact bury a 
friend this past year: American 
rapper XXXtentacion, who 
was shot and killed during a 
so-called robbery in June of 
2018. In an interview with 
Montreality, Billie speaks on 
XXX: “Jah was someone that 
stuck with me and got me 
through something that I felt 
like I would not have gotten 
through if it weren’t for him.” 
This interview (along with 
text messages Eilish posted 
on Instagram between her 
and 
Tentacion) 
launched 
surges of hate against Eilish, 
as fans wondered why her 
backbone came from a rapper 
imprisoned 
for 
aggravated 
battery 
of 
his 
pregnant 
girlfriend, 
amongst 
other 

charges. 
“bury a friend” immediately 
captivates with the feature 
of 
Eilish’s 
friend 
Crooks, 
whose sonorous voice calls 
out, “Billie.” However, the 
rest of the single is slightly 
disappointing, especially for 
longtime Eilish fans. The 
most egregious letdown is her 
overuse of the preoccupation: 
“All artists are so sad, sadness 

is what creates great art.” 
Although truthful in some 
ways, Eilish hits this trope 
home time and time again 
without digging deeper into 
a possibly more profound 
space. She makes it clear 
in 
every 
interview 
that 
she hates herself, a notion 
that is present in her song 
“Idontwannabeyouanymore” 
and now in “bury a friend” 

with the lyrics, “Like I wanna 
drown, like I wanna end me” 
and “Honestly I thought that I 
would be dead by now.”
The 
second 
letdown 
is 
her 
seeming 
embrace 
of 
making an abnormal creation 
because it’s cool, as opposed to 
creating something with the 
beauty of sound as a priority. 
Abnormality is dope, but I’d 
like to see the song stand for 
itself by musical standards. 
The track is choppy, cutting 
from different melodies quite 
quickly — these melodies 
bump, but they’re fleeting.
Her debut album WHEN 
WE 
ALL 
FALL 
ASLEEP, 
WHERE 
DO 
WE 
GO? 
comes out Mar. 29th. The 
expectations and fame she’s 
acquired could cause anyone 
to cave, but I have no doubt 
Eilish 
will 
harnesses 
her 
struggles and turn them into a 
crazy and creative experience. 
That is, after all, what made 
her so great in the first place.

If you look at a white grid 
over a black background, you 
will see grey splotches at the 
intersections of the grid. You’ll 
find, however, that the second 
you 
try 
to 
examine 
closer 
and focus your gaze upon a 
particular dot, it vanishes.
Those shapes never really 
existed, but you saw them, didn’t 
you? The binary concept of real 
vs. unreal fails to explain these 
dots; they can’t be simply one 
or the other. Binary concepts 
such as reality vs. unreality, 
truth vs. fiction and good vs. 
bad have long been the target 
of 
postmodern 
philosophers 
such as Jacques Derrida, who 
seek to demonstrate how these 
oppositions are nothing more 
than illusions.

Hauntology: What is it?
Hauntology is a concept that 
has its origins in postmodern 
deconstruction 
theory. 
Specifically, it began with the 
work of Derrida, who used the 
word “hauntology” to describe 
the alternate future promised by 
modernism that never came to 
be, the disjunction between the 
reality we live in and the cultural 
memory 
of 
the 
anticipated 
reality we thought we would be 
living in.
It is a term that offers freedom 
for creative interpretation, and 
while typically used to reference 
temporal disturbances and the 
ever-increasing 
interaction 
between the present and the 
past, I will use it to refer to 
a 
broader 
but 
intertwined 
dichotomy: 
Real 
experience 
vs. unreal experience. While 
perhaps abstract-sounding at 
first, it is not hard to think of 
examples of experiences you’ve 
had where the power of the 
moment comes from what didn’t 
happen as opposed to what 
did. Picture yourself passing 
through a crowded nightclub. 
You lock eyes with someone who 
passes by with a slight smile, 
but neither of you turn back, 
the flash of potential fading as 
soon as it begins to burn. Stories 
you’ve heard that you only know 
through imagination; dreams 
that slip away as you wake but 
leave 
emotional 
traces 
that 
you can’t shake throughout the 
day; missed opportunities and 
regrets that hound you even 
when their sources are long 
gone — these unrealities are 
just as impactful on our internal 
experience as the realities we 
experience, and hauntology is an 
attempt to capture the ineffable 
emotion that comes at the border 
of the two.

Burial
In the realm of music, the 
concept of “hauntology” has 
been applied almost exclusively 
to British electronic acts in 
the late ’90s and ’00s such as 
Boards of Canada and Ghost 
Box. The artist most closely 
associated with hauntology is 
the enigmatic UK electronic act 
Burial. Critical to hauntology 
is a feeling of broken time, a 
dreamlike non-linearity. In the 
music of Burial, this feeling is 
created through a few key means: 
The first, and most salient, is 
the use of ghostly R&B samples 
from decades past that echo 

coldly with distorted emotional 
resonance. 
Also 
contributing 
is his drum and bass patterns, 
skittish and inverted: Instead 
of keeping time they further 
warp it. His sampling technique 
captures and emphasizes all 
the mechanical noise, vinyl 
crackle and static of the original 
recordings, helping to create this 
sense of temporal disjunction, 
almost as though each element 
of the track has been lifted not 
just from a different place but a 
different time, a different reality 
that never came to be. Even 
the title of his most important 
album, Untrue, reaffirms this 
theme of the unreal. The cover 
art, too, depicts a unreal reality 
— it is clear that, while we see 
an angular, grey, dystopian café, 
the true experience depicted 
does not actually exist; rather, it 
is happening inside his head.

Vaporwave
Vaporwave, 
a 
subgenre 
of 
electronic 
music 
which 
emerged about half a decade 
ago, is a little more overt in its 
relationship with time through 
its supposedly-ironic embrace 
of 
the 
hyper-consumerism 
of the ’80s and ’90s. I say 
“supposedly 
ironic” 
because 
even though popular consensus 
is that the vaporwave aesthetic 
is a critique of consumerist 
society, I disagree: Vaporwave 
is hauntological through its 
nostalgia for the early days 
of the internet, an artifact of 
cultural memory from when 
the future seemed much more 
exciting and reality seemed 
much more simple. The genre 
focuses on the subsequent loss 
of this innocence (see: “Teen 

Pregnancy” by Blank Banshee). 
If you look for vaporwave videos 
on Youtube, the predominant 
style involves heavy use of 
temporal disjunctions (i.e. Greek 
statues in a grid-like cyberspace) 
that channel the feeling of a 
future that never came.

Hauntology in other art 
forms
This broader definition of 
hauntology allows for it to be 
applied more liberally to other 
forms of artistic expression, 
particularly visual media.
The 
recent 
cross-platform 
surge of a neon aesthetic (see: 
“Drive”, Kavinsky, /r/outrun) 
could also be viewed through 
a critical lens of hauntology, 
where 
the 
“retro” 
styling 
belies a deeper yearning for 
this futuristic reality that was 
anticipated in the ’80s, that 
might have been but ultimately 
wasn’t. The constant inability 
of society to break free of self-
reference (i.e. the past) is another 
component of hauntology that 
is certainly at play here. The 
re-emergence of neon aesthetics 
in the middle of the ’10s is 
almost the visual equivalent of a 
musical sample, where a cultural 
artifact from the past is altered 
to carry a different intonation 
or meaning, becoming ghostlike 
and haunting in the process.
Even the popular television 
series 
Twin 
Peaks: 
The 
Return can be interpreted as 
hauntological: Without spoiling 
anything for those who haven’t 
seen it, a major plot point 
revolves around how the past 
interacts with the present and 
how dead futures are still, in 
some sense, alive. The loss 
of innocence explored in the 
original 
series 
and 
spin-off 
movie Twin Peaks: Fire Walk 
With Me leads the town of Twin 
Peaks to a dissonant future, 
where 
something, 
somehow, 
feels missing even though it 
never ended up existing. The 
shots of Sarah Palmer alone in 
her empty home watching old 
TV programs are the visual 
equivalent of Burial’s tunes, a 
certain inescapable loneliness 
brought by the unreal.

Hauntology 
and 
the 
supernatural
An interesting theory that 
has surfaced in developmental 
psychology is the idea that 
“monsters,” as children conceive 
of them, are a mechanism 
through which their fear that 
the adults in their life, who 
are to kids inscrutable and 
all-powerful, will turn on or 
abandon them is confronted. 
Similarly, ghosts can be viewed 
as a physical projection of 
a deeper sense of temporal 
disjunction, or a fear that our past 
mistakes and traumas loom over 
our heads, making themselves 
known only long enough that we 
remember that they have been 
there all along. The specters and 
wraiths of our past hover just 
beyond our reach, equal parts 
teasing and threatening, only 
visible in those supernatural 
moments where time seems to 
fold before our eyes: A strange 
light, an alienated walk home, 
or the moment between waking 
life and sleep. Much like the dots 
in the optical illusion, if you try 
to home in on these lost futures, 
they vanish.

The magic of hauntology 
and its manifestations

JONAH MENDELSON
Daily Arts Writer

“Death and the Miser” is a 
1561 painting from Hieronymus 
Bosch that depicts a classical 
deathbed scene, with the figure of 
death creeping into a room from 
a side-door to take the life of the 
individual sitting on a bed to the 
right of the painting.
Death takes the form of a 
skeleton, clad in drab clothing 
and holding a spear of sorts. It 
appears unfriendly, cold, but great 
in stature. A grey piece of cloth 
twists around Death’s head and 
carries down to the feet, like an 
oversized toga, as if the skeleton 
didn’t deserve the garb it found 
itself in. Interestingly, Death seems 
to be moving slowly; it does not 
seem like it had planned to burst 
into the room and follow with a 
quick escape. Instead, it is almost 
as if death had knocked prior to 
entering the room.
There 
are 
three 
human-
appearing individuals in the room: 
One in a brown robe, fiddling 
with something at the foot of 
the deathbed; another without 
clothing, tucked underneath the 
sheets of the deathbed (supposedly 
the one for whom Death has 
appeared); and another clad in 
white touching the shoulder of 
the 
soon-to-be 
deceased 
and 
looking directly at Death with 
an outstretched hand — not 
welcoming it, but acknowledging 
it.
It is the relationship between 

death and this individual clad in 
white that is of most interest to me.
My mother was an internist at 
a small hospital outside of Detroit 
for some years before we moved 
to the fringes of Ann Arbor. As a 
specialist in internal medicine, 
she worked with patients who had 
been admitted to the hospital and 
placed under her care.
Working at a smaller, more rural 
hospital, her case load inevitably 
involved fewer instances of fast-
paced trauma and more instances 
of elderly patients for whom age 
was simply taking its medical toll. 
This, however, never exempted 
her from a healthy dose of 
interesting medical stories and life 
experiences: I grew up in earshot 
of an innumerable amount of 
complex medical discussions and 
consultations that my developing 
mind couldn’t comprehend.
Over the years of being filtered 
into the pre-med pool of academia 
(against the advice of my mother), I 
heard more and more tales from her 
residency and practice to attempt 
to sway me from the grueling 
track that will be medical school 
and residency. She recounted 
experiences 
of 
rude 
patients, 
changing electronic systems, the 
threat of depositions. She told 
me about her long on-call shifts, 
nightmares about her patients and 
the pitting feeling of guilt when 
something didn’t go your way.
One story that has failed to 
banish itself from my mind and 
my mother’s involves an on-call 
shift in 1996. My mother, as an 

attending internist, was tasked 
with rounding the entire admitting 
floor, patients who had been judged 
as needing more extensive and 
prolonged medical treatment than 
the emergency department could 
provide.
“I had just finished a code 
when I was called to the floor 
below me to see a patient,” said my 
mother upon my request for her to 
recount the story. A “code” refers 
to a “code blue,” which denotes a 
patient who has gone into cardiac 
arrest, resulting in immediate 
resuscitative efforts. In this case, 
my mother’s patient was unable 
to be successfully resuscitated, 
and my mother had to call out the 
patient’s death.
“This patient had called me to 
tell me that she had seen death 
walk by, and was walking around 
the halls. She was afraid that it 
was coming for her and I told her 
no, it was for someone else.” she 
continued. “She went right back to 
sleep.”
“Death and the Miser” is 
considered to be a memento mori, 
or “reminder of death.” In depicting 
the 
physical 
manifestation 
of 
death, Bosch introduces the notion 
that death is mobile; it can show up 
in unfortunate places. The story 
presented by my mother and her 
patient illustrate a similar idea. 
You might see Death roaming the 
halls. You might see Death asking 
to enter a room. Yet, Death might 
not be there for you; it might be on 
its way to a code, to an outstretched 
hand, clad in white.

Upon googling “gothic rock 
and the supernatural” I was 
utterly shocked — disgusted even 
— to find very little on the topic 
save a “The 20 Best Goth Songs 
of the Last 20 Years” listicle. I’m 
sorry, but you’ll have to excuse me 
while I rant about the intrinsic 
reliance with which goth has laid 
its roots in the fertile soil of the 
supernatural.
It’s 1979, and the founding 
fathers of goth rock, better known 
as Bauhaus, have just released 
their first single, a 10-minute 
crawler titled “Bela Lugosi’s 
Dead.” Ten minutes, only 11 lines 
of verse and a chorus repeating 
“Bela 
Lugosi’s 
dead 
/ 
Bela 
Lugosi’s dead / Undead undead 
undead.” I’m assuming at this 
point you’re either a film major or 
you’re wondering “Who the hell 
is Bela Lugosi?” Bela Lugosi is the 
Hungarian-American actor who 
portrayed Dracula in the 1931 film 
by the same name. So here we 
have what is widely considered 
the first goth rock song inspired 
by one of the first films to be based 
on one of the most widely beloved 
gothic horror novels. This is 
literally an art movement that has 
spanned hundreds of years and 
crossed mediums, maintaining 
its momentum, and not a single 
article 
has 
mentioned 
the 
importance of the supernatural 
in all things gothic. Bauhaus 
sparked a movement, one that 
brought bleak melodies into a 
union with the spooky, romantic 
imagery of gothic horror: “The 
virginal brides file past his tomb 
/ Strewn with time’s dead flowers 
/ Bereft in deathly bloom / Alone 
in a darkened room / The count.”

Goth is the marriage of the 
supernatural and the romantic, 
and 
Bauhaus 
found 
a 
way 
to reflect that sonically. The 
supernatural is critical to the 
development of gothic art and 
essential to its use as a descriptor. 
The Cure is too catchy to be 
goth you say? Oh, I’m sorry, 
apparently you haven’t listened 
to “The Figurehead” off the 
underappreciated Pornography: 
“A scream tears my clothes as the 
figurines tighten / With spiders 
inside them / And dust on the lips 
of a vision of hell / I laughed in the 

mirror for the first time in a year.” 
Oddly sensual for such harrowing 
images … kind of like goth.
The fact that rock began to 
borrow these emotions from 
literature isn’t all that surprising. 
Most lyricists with any semblance 
of fame can list off a host of 
writers who have influenced their 
own work, and fans have clung to 
the words from the likes of Ian 
Curtis, Robert Smith and Siouxsie 
Sioux for decades. But these 
artists are decades old and mostly 
defunct (albeit, we do have a new 

The Cure record to look forward 
to!). So what happens when one of 
pop’s biggest breakouts decides to 
drop a goth EP? TURN OFF THE 
LIGHT, VOL. 1 by Kim Petras sent 
everyone head-over-heels for its 
combination of pop’s glamour 
and goth’s supernatural horror.
“Goth pop” is a phrase that 
is far too often tossed around. 
Alice Glass/Crystal Castles is not 
goth — aesthetically, perhaps, but 
thematically, no. But with the 
release of her newest EP, Kim’s 
soaring, catchy vocals mix with 
moody trance beats, all layered 
with some incredibly goth lyrics. 
The first lyrical track on the 
record, “Close Your Eyes,” doesn’t 
waste time in proving the work’s 
goth nature: “Sometimes the best 
things kinda hurt / ’Cause this is 
real, it’s unrehearsed / My fatal 
touch, you’ll feel cursed.” This 
is followed by the instrumental 
dance banger “TRANSylvania,” 
whose pulsing bass parallels the 
downtrodden rhythms of some of 
goth rock’s greatest hits.
What I am getting at here is 
that goth is a genre of many forms, 
unconfined to any one medium or 
sound, but it is firmly, indelibly 
rooted in the supernatural, the 
horror of the unknown. Could 
Petras’s 
small 
collection 
be 
an indication of goth’s revival 
in the pop sphere for the 21st 
century? Only time will tell, but 
historically speaking, gothic art 
has been around for about 300 
years to date, and I’ll be shocked 
if it doesn’t continue to innovate 
the way we look at horror and 
romance for years to come. Goth 
is an artistic microcosm born 
from human fascination with 
the supernatural, and it should 
be revered as the pioneering, 
essential movement that it is.

PIXAR

When I was eight, a strange 
thing happened. I was on my way 
up the stairs of my old house, 
about ready for bed, and heard 
my mom gasp from the kitchen. 
I looked back to her to see her 
clutching her coffee cup with 
her eyes somewhat wide. “The 
basement light just turned on,” 
she said. No one was supposed 
to be downstairs. My sister was 
next to me, my dad in the living 
room. Warily, my parents headed 
to the basement armed with steak 
knives and searched every corner. 
Of course, they found nothing 
out of the ordinary. My dad even 
trudged out into our snowy 
backyard to look for footprints. 
He didn’t find any. The whole 
thing was silly, in retrospect.
Many of us have memories 
that fringe on the preternatural, 
that are somewhere between 
the almost explicable and the 
undeniably spooky. But a place 
that nearly everyone has seen 
the supernatural at work for 
themselves is in film. Film ghosts 
are everywhere — they’re not 
limited by genre or archetype. In 
fact, they span an array of abilities, 
personas, and motivations.

Casper:
At 
their 
shallowest, 
and 
arguably their most fun, ghosts in 
film are odd companions, comic 
relief and maniacal antagonists. 
Casper the Friendly Ghost, first 
created as a cartoon character 
in the 1940s, has become our 
collective 
interpretation 
of 
how the average ghost should 
look like: a cloud-like, white 
apparition hovering wherever it 
pleases. Casper is the ultimate 
“everyghost,” 
the 
spirit 
of 
the afterlife most relatable to 
the living. His relation to the 
supernatural is a giddy and purely 
benign one. He shows us that we 
don’t have to be scared of ghosts 
at all. They may be a little more 
translucent and monochromatic 
than we are, but that doesn’t 
mean they can’t be companions.

Moaning Myrtle:
J.K. Rowling brought to life 
a whole new kind of ghost with 
the “Harry Potter” series, and 
while these ghosts are largely 
underrepresented in the film 
adaptations of her novels (most 
notably Peeves the Poltergeist), 
Moaning 
Myrtle 
steals 
the 

ethereal spotlight in the second 
installment of the series, “The 
Chamber of Secrets.” Myrtle is 
not simply the wailing tormentor 
of 
a 
decrepit 
bathroom 
at 
Hogwarts; she also provides 
the key piece to the story’s 
central mystery of unlocking the 
Chamber. Behind her hilarious 
melodrama, deceptive coyness 
and ear-splitting wails, Myrtle is 
the ghost with the missing answer 
— the solution that has evaded 
Harry and his friends from the 
beginning. She’s wonderful.

“Beetlejuice”:
Tim 
Burton, 
a 
director 
known 
for 
his 
theatricality 
and 
otherworldly 
atmosphere 
decided to push the boundaries 
of the spirit world with 1988’s 
“Beetlejuice,” a film as over-
the-top as it is rewatchable. 
Michael Keaton’s full-throated, 
comical performance as the film’s 
eponymous villain is something 
of a twisted delight to witness. 
Beetlejuice is both grotesque and 
sloppily charming. Of course we 
find him repulsive, but there’s 
something 
uncannily 
inviting 
about 
Keaton’s 
exaggerated 
gestures, snarky delivery and 
clownish affectation.

“Coco”:
At their most profound, ghost 
stories provide far more than 
goofy 
characters 
and 
visual 
spectacle. Ghosts in film have the 
capacity to express our shared 
human expectations, ruminations 
and anxieties about death itself. 
Perhaps no movie captures this 
depth better than Pixar’s “Coco,” 
a poignant journey about a young 
boy lost in the land of the dead 
with only the assistance of his 
departed family members to find 
his way home.
“Coco” explores the spirit 
world in ways that few other films 
have. Not only are the ghosts 
of the film benign, but they are 
Miguel’s own ancestors, shedding 
light on his heritage and the 
lost truths that have ultimately 
torn the family apart. The film 
uses these ghosts so effectively 
because they become essential 
vehicles to tell the story at hand 
as well as unravel more complex 
quandaries of grief, detachment 
and reconciliation.

“A Ghost Story”:
The most on-the-nose title 
for a tale of the supernatural 
also managed to become one of 
the most heart-wrenching and 

philosophical examples of ghosts 
in film. “A Ghost Story” is an 
affecting story about supernatural 
forces that act through the bond 
of love. As mawkish of a premise 
as that may sound, director David 
Lowery (“The Old Man and the 
Gun”) maximizes the emotional 
impact of the movie in a way 
that feels fresh and simplistic. 
Rooney Mara’s performance as a 
mourning widow is empathic and 
legitimately haunting, enhanced 
by the invisible presence of her 
late husband outfitted plainly 
in a white sheet, played by 
Casey Affleck. Lowery’s work 
is a testament to the simplicity 
ghost stories can operate without 
losing their sweeping cosmic 
implications.

“The Others”:
Unfortunately, 
it’s 
nearly 
impossible to discuss my favorite 
ghost story without spoiling 
its whirlwind of a conclusion. 
Suffice it to say that what “The 
Others” does best is to blur the 
line between the real and the 
ghostly, investigating death as 
a process rather than an event. 
“The Others” uses a hackneyed 
haunted 
house 
premise 
to 
take advantage of a viewer’s 
expectations, but subverts them 
ruthlessly by the end of the film. 
What seems like a traditional 
horror story on first watch turns 
ultimately into a spellbinding 
tragedy that might be the single 
best example of cinematic ghosts.
It was only much later, years 
after my family’s strange incident 
with the basement light, that 
we realized what had actually 
triggered our panic. The pressure 
from my sister and I walking up 
the stairs had likely disturbed 
wiring 
above 
the 
basement, 
causing the stairway light to 
switch on.
The aspect that differentiates 
film ghosts from the supernatural 
phenomena 
that 
we 
recall 
around campfires and during 
thunderstorm blackouts is this: 
The ghosts in movies need 
no explanation. They can be 
make-believe 
because 
film 
itself is an escape from reality. 
In real life, we have a tendency 
to explain away the initially 
inexplicable to feel in control of 
our surroundings. But in film, 
there is no desire, no necessity to 
do such a thing. We can interact 
with the supernatural, become 
endeared or frightened by it. But 
most importantly, we don’t have 
to challenge it.

image of ghosts on film

“You don’t seem too haunted, 
but you haunted,” poet Terrance 
Hayes writes in the ninth sonnet of 
his collection “American Sonnets 
for My Past and Future Assassin.” 
In the context of the collection, 
this haunted thing is a black body 
in modern America (“You will not 
assassinate my ghosts,” he writes 
at the end of the 13th sonnet). But 
literature of the present moment, 
too, is a haunted thing that does 
not, perhaps, immediately present 
itself as such.
There has been a resurrection 
in American fiction of a fascination 
with the dead, undead, half-dead 
and dying. And even when these 
texts aren’t filled with literal 
ghosts, there’s a hauntedness — an 
uneasy feeling that things are not 
quite as they should be — that seeps 
out of everything I read.
It’s like walking down a dark 
hallway late at night in your own 
home, which is safe because it’s 
your home and monsters aren’t 
real. And yet, you feel for a moment 
as if something could slip out from 
the shadows are grab you. Even 
though you are an adult, you feel 
it. That’s what reading in 2019 feels 
like.
Ghosts are not new, of course. 
But this ghost, the modern, literary 
ghost is something unlike those 
that trolled the halls of Edith 
Wharton or Shirley Jackson’s 
haunted mansions and wreaked 
havoc on barefoot children in 
nightshirts. It’s not like Stephen 
Dedalus seeing his mother’s grey, 
melting face, but it’s also not not 
like that.
A ghost is an odd supernatural 
being because it doesn’t come with 
guidelines. Vampires drink blood, 
avoid the sun and (as popular 
teen media constantly reminds 
us) have sex. Zombies do not have 
sex, but they lumber and represent 
consumption and capitalism in 
their purest, most disturbing forms. 
Witches are persecuted because 
— for better or worse — they are 
women with unchecked power. 
But ghosts are a harder thing to 
define. Perhaps because they are 
(often) noncorporeal, voiceless and 
vague: existing literally without 
the definition of body or self. Or 
perhaps because the thing they 
represent—something that was, but 
isn’t any long — is more malleable 
than fears of sexual “perversion,” 
consumerism or power.
A ghost is a reminder that 
the past lives, even when we 
don’t want it to. In that way, it 
can mean trauma, memory, loss. 
It’s no wonder ghosts crop up in 
narratives of immigration (like Viet 
Thanh Nguyen’s “The Refugees”), 
sexual trauma (Karen Russell’s 
“Swamplandia!”) 
and 
racist 
violence (Jesmyn Ward’s “Sing, 
Unburied, Sing”). When people 
want to forget, ghosts resolve to 
stay. They remind and in that, they 

find their fearful power.
There’s the ghost towns (and 
supermarkets) 
of 
Alexandra 
Kleeman’s “You Too Can Have A 
Body Like Mine,” the campfire-
story-esque spin of the stories in 
Carmen Maria Machado’s “Her 
Body And Other Parts,” and the 
nosy, curious spectors of George 
Saunder “Lincoln In The Bardo,” 
all of which, in their own distinct 
ways, have fun with these dark, 
indefinite beings.
Even on the more benign, 
domestic level ghosts represent 
the things we don’t want to look 
right in the eyes. Michael Furey 
in James Joyce’s “The Dead” is a 
ghost only in that his presence is 
felt supernaturally: He represents 
the impossible and horrible truth 
that the people we love, loved other 
people before us. Snow comes down 
on the windows like tiny, tapping 
hands at the story’s close, and Joyce 
maintains narrative reality and 
casts a ghostly emotional aura.

Following in those footsteps, 
much 
of 
contemporary 
ghost 
literature straddles the line of 
belief, never letting on wholly what 
it thinks is real and not real. In 
“Swamplandia!” a teenage girl runs 
away with her ghost boyfriend on a 
ghost ship. The terms are explicit 
and because a child’s point of view 
is privileged, belief is everywhere. 
But what the characters believe 
and what the text believes are 
maintained as two seperate things. 
Maybe those things meet and 
maybe they don’t.
Ghosts need this ambiguity. 
Unlike 
their 
cousins 
in 
the 
supernatural world, ghosts rely on 
belief. You don’t believe in zombies: 
They exist or they don’t. But you 
believe in ghosts, even if you can 
never know for sure.
Surprisingly 
enough, 
ghost 
shows — yes, like the “Ghost 
Adventures” kind of ghost shows 
— operate in the same way. They 
present themselves as scientific 
investigations with video and 
audio and radio equipment. And 
regardless of whether they fake the 
results these machines produce, 
they’re very careful about what 
they don’t fake. There’s a reason 
we never see a ghost as anything 
more that a streak of light. It could 

be dust or a lens flare or a glitch, 
but we don’t know. If you know. If 
you see the transparent child in a 
nightgown in the upstairs hallway, 
it isn’t fun anymore. Because you 
don’t have to believe, you just know.
In literature, the relationship 
between knowing and believing 
opens up even further the narrative 
possibilities. Do we believe in 
ghosts? And if we do, do we believe 
the character who sees the ghost? 
And if we do believe the character 
who sees the ghosts, does the 
novel? The very convention of ghost 
stories denies closure and answers. 
Because we can never know.
And, when this endeavor into 
belief is done well, it doesn’t feel 
anything 
like 
“Contact,” 
that 
horrible movie with Matthew 
Mcconaughey and Jodie Foster 
that equates belief in aliens and 
belief in God. In the world of 
narrative fiction God is much 
more like vampires and ghosts are 
much more like aliens. God has 
canonical rules and institutions 
and customs. Aliens and ghosts are 
more indefinite things.
Every new ghost requires new 
belief, and every new ghost story 
must establish the terms of that 
belief.
Casey Affleck being a terrible 
person aside, I think “A Ghost 
Story” (David Lowrey’s 2017 white-
sheet-ghost film) handles this 
question of belief in a particularly 
interesting way. The film spends a 
long time (perhaps too much time) 
on one insufferable man’s nihilist 
monologue without ever hinting at 
whether it agrees with him or not. 
The ghost, when he rattles the light 
bulbs at the end, give an indication 
of an opinion, but the film does not.
This ambiguity is particularly 
powerful in the modern era of ghost 
stories because the physical things 
many of them represent are real. 
Real in a way that negates belief. 
But these stories don’t often deal 
with the real explicitly, but rather 
the less physical, less tangible 
effects of the real. You cannot feel 
the shape of generational trauma in 
the same way you feel the shape of 
a bed or a chair, but the characters 
of these stories live in it as if it 
were a house, carrying with them 
the ghosts of their histories and 
parents and home countries.
What stays behind is not 
something 
(sorry 
“Ghost 
Adventures”) that can be measured 
by any device or apparatus, no 
matter how strong or advanced. 
And that is precisely what makes 
America in 2019 the haunted place 
that it is. We can’t see or feel or 
know everything that is here. But 
that doesn’t make it all less here.
Ghost stories remain strongholds 
of the literary canon because, to be 
sentimental and a little reductive, 
history is itself a kind of ghost 
story. To live in the world is to walk 
through a minefield of ghosts that 
both belong to and because of you 
and your people and where you 
come from.

‘Mile High’

James Blake

Polydor Records

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW: ‘MILE HIGH’

As it begins, the music 
video for James Blake’s “Mile 
High,” starring Blake and 
Travis Scott, doesn’t make 
much sense. The lead single 
from Blake’s Assume Form 
is ethereal and dark, but the 
very beginning of the video 
provides a stark contrast. 
Blake is seated by himself 
in the “Mile High Cafe” and 
is soon joined by an overly 
enthusiastic 
Travis 
Scott, 
who 
begins 
to 
question 
his 
high-octane 
lifestyle, 
ludicrously 
declaring 
that 
he is considering not using 
a cellphone anymore. As he 
says all of this, Blake stares 
at a cup of tea and begins to 
zone out. The camera position 
changes from third person 
to first person, shot through 
the pupil of James Blake. As 
the song begins, an image of 
Blake falling through space 

is overlaid with a crooning 
Scott.
The remainder of the video 
finds the two men firmly 
planted 
in 
Blake’s 
mind 
as the camera seemingly 

floats from Blake to the 
ether and back to Scott. 
From this point onward, the 
video and the song begin to 
synchronize. By itself, the 
song details the ponderings 
of old relationships; however, 
with the music video, these 
thoughts 
seem 
so 
much 
more critical because they 

take place in the depths of 
Blake’s mind. Blake and Scott 
are essentially two parts 
of Blake’s inner voice, and 
the music video details the 
conflict within Blake. Scott 
embodies the inner voice of 
Blake that wants to hold on 
to an old relationship, but 
as Blake sings, he tries to 
convince himself that, at this 
point in his life, it will never 
last.
As the video comes to a 
close, James Blake wearily 
exits the recesses of his 
thoughts. As he returns to the 
Mile High Cafe, a concerned 
Travis Scott attempts to get 
Blake’s attention — he waves 
his arms in front of his face 
and genuinely asks, “(y)ou all 
right?”

POLYDOR

A lot of people have asked me 
to preside over their funeral. They 
usually pop the question about a 
year into our relationship, when 
I’ve been worn down to the sort 
of loyalty that compels careful 
documentation of their requests 
(a note in my phone titled “friend 
funerals”). This has happened 
frequently enough, unprompted, 
for me to identify with it in a way, 
as if making sure my friends go out 
in the manner they desire is some 
spiritual duty I was chosen for 
way, way back. I mean, how else do 
I explain such a macabre pattern 
to myself?
Don’t get me wrong, I take it 
very seriously. Derek wants the 
full 15 minutes of Maurice Ravel’s 
“Bolero” as his urn of ashes is 
slowly wheeled up to the front. My 
roommate has requested Frank 
Ocean’s “Novacane” while her 
brothers process with her soaring 
coffin, each one assigned specific 
lines to perform throughout (A.J. 
gets “cocaine for breakfast, yikes”). 
An individual whose identity I 
must protect has this vision where 
their cremated remains are served 
to their extended family in a 
lavish seven-course meal, the end 
of which features me delivering 
a speech revealing what (or, 
more specifically, who) has been 
eaten. Nicoletta simply wants 
to be mauled by a hellhound, no 
fuss about it. That one’s a little 
complicated 
because 
I’m 
not 
exactly sure how to gather the 
resources, but lord knows I would 
walk 500 miles and 500 more to 
secure some Cerberus for that 
queen.
My cousin Sarah thinks it’s 
the darndest thing, that it’s more 
complimentary than being asked 
to do something totally normal 
and fun with my friends while 
they are, say, alive.
“It’s such a testament to your 
character!” she told me, totally 
stoked, sipping Pét-Nat around an 
October fire in Northern Virginia. 
“These people are looking at you 
like, ‘Oh that chick? I can trust 
her with my death.’” Pretty metal. 
Verity Sturm: Funeral planner.
This is a long way of explaining 
why I wasn’t all that surprised 
when my editor, Clara Scott, told 
me I would be the “perfect person” 
to write about the cemetery for her 
B-side. To be honest, I had a lot 

to do that week, the temps were 
looking like a soft 50 below zero, 
but hey. It wasn’t even a question, 
because this is the line of work I’ve 
been chosen for. Duty calls.
That being said, I wasn’t about to 
die walking around the cemetery 
next to Markley in a polar vortex. 
It’s just not the end I’ve envisioned 
for myself. Instead, I dealt with 
the extreme weather by fleeing the 
state like a responsible adult. By 
the time I returned it was sunny 
and 40, yes, but this deadline was 
looming and I had squat. I sauced 
onto the cemetery’s website in a 
jiffy and started dicking around, 
looking for something, anything.
The 
Forest 
Hill 
Cemetery 
describes itself as “an unfinished 
landscape that welcomes all,” 
the private, non-profit brainchild 
of a 1857 collab between some 
University of Michigan profs and 
“a group of leading Ann Arbor 
businessmen.” Synergy, baby. She 
buries the dead. The cemetery’s 
design 
emulates 
the 
“rustic 
and rural cemetery tradition” 
popularized 
in 
19th-century 
France, notable for its rolling 
expanse of land, abundance of 
trees and displacement from town 
and churchyard.
18,000 people are buried at 
Forest Hill, but there’s room 
for 8,000 more, although prices 
range from a modest 835 dollar 
cremorial unit to that skinny 3145 
dollar 
glass-front 
middle-row 
spot in the coveted Columbarium. 
The hellhound would probably be 
cheaper, but investment in Forest 
Hill secures your remains in 
exciting proximity to those of local 
celebs like John Allen, founder 
of Ann Arbor, and the popular 
spiritual guru Bo Schembechler.
Forest Hill Cemetery boasts 
a sparse Facebook account (not 
a page — a full-on user account), 
65 gothic acres and 4.7 stars on 
Google. Most importantly, its 
website features a robust database 
of 
historical 
information 
on 
those buried there (leave it to a 
University cemetery to incorporate 
data frames into their business, 
some undergrad is totally getting 
whipped to parse that shit, RIP my 
dude). Anywho, if you scroll down 
the bottom of the “Internment” 
page, you’ll run into a regal little 
search bar, all burgundy and warm 
gray and curly serifs inviting you 
to just type in your own name 
and see what happens (excellent 
UX). I’m always looking out for 
the Sturms of this world, so before 

I even realized what I was doing, 
my surname appeared in the bar 
and I was smashing that “search” 
button.
Lo and behold, there are Sturms 
buried in Forest Hill. Two, to be 
exact: Henry and Carl. My own 
kith and kin? Next to Markley? 
Spooky. I immediately shot an 
inquiry to the unique void that is 
the parent group chat, demanding 
intel on a Carl or Henry in the 
family tree. My parents, god love 
them, were wholly unhelpful. My 
mother responded immediately 
with 
the 
robotically 
urgent 
question-statement “ARE YOU 
IN 
CEMETERY.” 
My 
father 
took a more nostalgic approach, 
reminding me that “We are from 
Pfaffenhoefen (German flag emoji) 
near Augsburg and Munich. Fun 
loving Bavarians!” Thanks guys. 
The unique void never fails to be 
uniquely voidy. It looked like this 
fun-loving Bavarian was taking 
matters into her own hands.
This is how I spent Sunday 
morning pacing about Forest Hill 
Cemetery in the sun and mud, 
hungover as hell, searching for my 
ancestors.
I can see how Forest Hill would 
be an interesting, sexy area to 
wander around for the sake of 
wandering. It’s not a particularly 
happening spot on campus, so 
the whole place is softened with a 
silence that grows thicker as you 
move through the first few rows 
of crumbling graves and into the 
acres and acres of dead beyond. 
And winter looks good on the 
dead: The contrast between stone 
and snow, light and dark, brings 
sinuous attention to the curve 
and corner of every tombstone, 
monument and oak. By Sunday, the 
melting snow had collected into 
massive pools of still water that 
snaked around entire family plots 
like moats, protecting them from 
the scrutiny of people like me. I 
was a minute visitor in a massive, 
permanent place: I felt powerless, 
alone and good.
But the thing is, I wasn’t really 
wandering. I was looking for 
Sturms. And let me tell you, Forest 
Hill is a hard place to navigate 
if you’ve got an agenda. There’s 
a map online, sure, but it kind of 
resembles a Matisse cut-out (when 
I asked my roommate what she 
thought it was, she told me “fish, 
parrot or crab”). The database 
told me that Henry and Carl were 
buried in plot 82, but the plots 
progress in an order far from

numeric and aren’t physically 
labeled on site. Forty minutes into 
my expedition, I was frustrated, 
lost and nauseous to boot. I had 
a meeting in half an hour, I had 
a hangover and I had a lot of 
doubt. 65 acres of mind-numbing 
tombstones studded out in every 
direction. I needed a sign.
As if on cue, I registered a sort 
of skidding sound in the distance, 
surprising me out of my solitary 
funk. And then a woman fell 
from the sky — one of the most 
beautiful women I’ve ever seen, 
honestly, crashing into the snow 
in a melee of curly hair and plaid. 
My jaw dropped. I was so lost in 
the sauce I thought someone had 
sent me an angel or a demon or 
something, but then the context 
arrived: A longboard, late, trailing 
in after her (the skidding noise) 
and a man on his board, also 
beautiful. He helped her up, they 
gave me an awkward, beautiful 
acknowledgement, and skated on 
by. I was too stunned and nervous 
to photograph them, so I took 
a picture of the impression her 
wipeout made in the snow. It felt 
spiritual.
While taking that arguably 
creepy shot, though, I accidentally 
paid extra-special attention to 
the family of graves she crashed 
on, “Hawkes,” and realized that I 
could orient myself in Forest Hill 
by looking up the surrounding 
graves on their database right then 
and there. My phone told me the 
Hawkeses were buried in plot 75 
and boom, I kind of had a loose 
idea of where I was. In a series 
of searches, the Kau, Buzzo and 
Loomis families all helped me 
move closer and closer to plot 82, 
and then I found them.
Carl and Henry were tucked 

side by side as expected, but 
there was a surprise to the left: 
Wilhelmina, held at an awkward 
grave’s length away, another Sturm 
that somehow didn’t make the 
database. How scandalous! While 
photographing their wonderfully 
austere, bevel-block gravestones, 
though, I realized that these were 
Sturmses, not Sturms. Indeed, 
while my surname is singular, 
theirs was plural: “Sturms.” The 
heck? How wrong could the 
database be? How much can we 
trust … data?
I left Forest Hill a little miffed 
by the inconsistencies; that is, 
determined to resolve them. A 
free ancestry.com trial later, I had 
some answers. Carl, originally 
Johann Joachim Hartwig, was 
born in Mecklenburg, Germany 
in 1823. He fell for a certain 
Wilhelmina (“Minnie”) in 1856, 
and the two came to the United 
States in 1863, where they settled 
in Ann Arbor and had five kids. 
Carl lived to a solid 71 and Minnie 
a goddamn impressive 91 (she died 
in 1918!), but their only son, Henry 
L., passed away tragically at the 
age of 31 before marrying or siring 
children of his own. All the dates 
lined up exactly — these had to be 
the people I found in Forest Hill.
Everything I read, though, 
recorded their surname as “Sturm” 
— singular, like mine. Why their 
gravestones spell “Sturms,” then, 
remains a mystery, not to mention 
Minnie’s unexplained exclusion 
from the Forest Hill database. And 
why is Minnie buried at a distance 
from her husband and son? And 
how the heck did they get “Carl” 
from “Johann Joachim Hartwig?” 
Something’s fishy here, that’s for 
sure. But I don’t have the time to 
figure out exactly what, that is 

also definitely for sure. Not now, 
at least.
One thing is for certain: I don’t 
think these people are technically 
related to me. I’ve never heard 
of a Carl/Johann or Minnie/
Wilhelmina in my Sturm ancestry, 
and Henry died before he could 
even pass it on, anyway. My dad’s 
text about Pfaffenhoefen actually 
came in handy when I pulled 
up a map to see if Mecklenburg 
was close enough to continue 
entertaining the notion. Turns 
out it’s on the literal opposite side 
of the country, those Sturms are 
absolute north while my clan hails 
from the southiest south. Unless 
the Sturms somehow spawned 
across the entire nation, it’s not 
looking likely. So it goes.
Genetics aside, I feel like I’m 
related to these Sturms. I have 
tracked them down, visited their 
grave and learned their history. 
And I’m caught up in their 
mysterious forces — the flying 
woman who eventually led me to 
them, the little mysteries in the 
details of their burial. They’re 
haunting me, taking on new 
life in my vulnerable, adjective-
laden brain: The displaced and 
introspective Carl, his fiery-fresh 
bride Minnie and the tragic story 
of their precious Henry, taken 
too soon. It’s as if these Sturms 
have come to me, like Derek and 
Nicoletta, and asked me to do the 
thing I do, to preside over their 
death.
These 
Sturms 
don’t 
want 
Frank Ocean or a seven-course 
meal, though. They’ve requested 
a Michigan Daily article, and a 
second life via imagination — 
yours and mine.
If that ain’t supernatural, I don’t 
know what is.

Walking around campus or the 
larger sloping grid of Ann Arbor, 
it’s easy to get the sense of an ever-
present history. Plaques adorn 
buildings and pop up on street 
corners, boasting black and white 
photographs of old marches and 
speeches; campus tours recount 
legends and lore long sealed into 
the school’s character.
This history takes a presumably 
darker turn if you stroll through 
Forest Hill Cemetery, where the 
mossy gravestones dotting the hills 
date centuries back. Who were 
these children and parents and 
grandparents, now sealed away 
in mausoleums or beneath grassy 
statues? It seems as if something 
unusual and distant has brought 
them there, rather than, in reality, 
the natural processes of time that 
all of us can reasonably expect.
Dwelling on it long enough 
can give you an eerie and often 
unwelcome feeling of the uncanny. 
It’s the same sensation that takes 
over if you’re talking with your 
friends late at night, or when you’re 
reading in your favorite coffee shop 
on State Street and find yourself 
relating a little too much to a ghost 
story. Or if you find yourself alone 
in an old building late at night, 
studying or working, and trying 
to convince yourself you’re just 
hearing things.

*

“For me, I like the lore of it,” said 
Megan Muma, manager at Arbor 
Brewing Company on Washington 
Street. “I like thinking about 
history. I like the idea that history 
can affect our sensory experience 
of the present. And kind of peeling 
back the layers of what it is that you 
observe in your day to day life, and 
thinking about how that might be 
related to someone else that lived a 
long time ago.”
Muma has been working at the 
Ann Arbor Brewpub since 2013, 
and says she started hearing stories 
about ghosts her first day on the 
job. The haunting of the building 
began with mist in the game 
room and the basement, which 
soon progressed to staff members 
seeing a man wearing what they 
described as a mailman’s uniform, 
walking around the game room, 
the dart area and the brewing side 
of the basement.
“At some point, they figured 
out that this was the location of a 
murder,” Muma said.
She was referring to the murder 
of Clifford Stang, an off-duty police 
officer who was shot dead on the 
property — at that time the Conlin 
and Wetherbee Clothing Store — in 
1935, after witnessing a robbery in 
progress. One of the two robbers, 
William “Shorty” Padgett, was 
arrested a year later. The other was 
never found.
Stang is perhaps the most 
famous ghost of the Brewpub, but 
according to Muma, he’s not the 
only one. Caretaker James Gertz, 
also known as Mr. Largebeat, 

started working here “right when it 
opened,” and claims to have seen a 
Victorian woman walking through 
the kitchen and the other side of 
the restaurant.
“He’s an old-timey rocker from 
way back in the day,” Muma said 
of Gertz. “He’s really into the 
paranormal and extraterrestrials 
and UFOs and all that kind of stuff. 
But he’s definitely spent the most 
time here as an employee, and 
then also spent most of the creepy 
hours here. Because he’s here in 
the morning, when it’s quiet and 
empty.”
An impression of the Victorian 
woman’s visage can be witnessed 
even during the non-creepy hours 
in one of the wooden booths at 
the Brewpub, where another staff 
member stenciled her silhouette.
“I think there are three types of 
ghost-presence here,” Muma said. 
“It’s the guy that was murdered, 
the lady and then there’s some kind 
of poltergeist activity. You know 
how poltergeists are attracted to 
negative energy?”
She went on to describe a student 
riot that took place on the grounds 
in 1908, when the building housed 
the Star Theater (prior to the 
Conlin and Wetherbee Clothing 
Store). After learning that the 
theater manager had approached 
a star University of Michigan 
football player with a financial offer 
to “throw” a game, students hurled 
bricks from a nearby construction 
site at the establishment until it 
was destroyed. Sixty-two arrests 
were made in attempts from police, 
firefighters and University officials 
to end the riot, which lasted all 
night.
“Actually I just learned about 
it last year, when the Ann Arbor 
library posted a bunch of historical 
information around town,” Muma 
said. “It was the site of the largest 
student riot in U of M history.”
This is why — short of the 
appearance 
of 
the 
uniformed 
officer or the Victorian woman — 
some of the strange goings-on at 
the Brewpub are tough to pin to a 
single entity.
“This is a very large building, 
and we have a lot of loud equipment, 
but even at night, it quiets down to 
a point. Sometimes you just hear 
really weird stuff that doesn’t 
really sound like a condenser, or a 
dishwasher, or any of the brewing 
equipment, ’cause you know it’s 
been shut off for hours. So a lot of 
staff hear sounds, or sometimes 
you hear music or talking, when 
you know everyone has left,” 
Muma said.
One 
particularly 
harrowing 
experience occurred in 2017, when 
the old general manager arrived 
to open in the morning and found 
pots and pans all over the kitchen.
“He 
was 
understandably 
upset — like, who did the worst 
close ever and just threw stuff all 
around the kitchen?” Muma said. 
“So he started looking through 
the cameras, and what he saw 
was not someone doing their job 
improperly, but just a lot of weird 
stuff flying around at four A.M., 
after everyone had left. And kind of 

flashes on the camera.”
The 
security 
footage 
isn’t 
kept for longer than five or six 
months, but Muma, who has seen 
this particular footage herself, 
described it for me: “We have two 
cameras, one that’s facing inside 
the kitchen and one that’s facing 
kind of toward the door ... On the 
door side, there were a bunch of 
flashes and weird lights. And on 
the kitchen side, there was just 
stuff flying off the shelf. Like, not 
just getting knocked, but flying. It 
was really weird and eerie to see.”
The poltergeist idea is Muma’s 
personal theory, based on strange 
happenings just like the pots and 
pans story. But the idea of negative 
energy is a compelling one, to the 
point that she has done a little 
research of her own.
“I tried to do a little bit of digging 
into what this space was before it 
was downtown Ann Arbor, and I 
probably could have invested a lot 
more time on it, but there wasn’t 
a lot of information about whose 
land it was,” Muma said. “You 
know, like what colonizers came in 
and did what to it. But I think that 
might be another interesting area 
of exploration, as to why spirits feel 
trapped here, and what horrible 
things happened on these grounds 
before they were a business.”
With stories like the pots and 
pans and the sightings of ghostly 
figures, it’s no wonder Muma and 
other staff members feel “creepy” 
or 
“watched” 
when 
they’re 
walking around the Brewpub or 
one of its three basements at night, 
after everyone else has left.
“I’ve definitely been afraid here 
after close, if I’m the only one in 
the building and I’m locking up, 
and I have to do a walk-around, 
you know, making sure everything 
is in its place, all the doors are 
locked. And it just feels like there is 
somebody here,” Muma said. “And 
they’re not going to leave.”

So what is it that makes certain 
places — a brewery, a theater, a 
whole city — feel more haunted 
than others? If you ask Lilly 
Inverse, founding member of the 
Ann Arbor Paranormal Research 
Society, it has to do with the lives 
and events that preceded the 
ghosts: The history that fascinates 
residents like Muma, before it was 
history.
“In my experience, haunted 
places have one thing in common: 
A strong energy during the life of 
those who seem to linger,” Inverse 
said in an email interview with 
The Daily, citing the Michigan 
Firehouse Museum in Ypsilanti, 
which has burned down in the past, 
as one example. “Big events like 
fires, battles, murders, etc., seem 
to give those who were involved 
the ability to return to the location 
after they pass.”
Inverse founded the Ann Arbor 
Paranormal 
Research 
Society, 
which is always accepting new 
volunteers, in an effort to offer 
residents of Ann Arbor and beyond 
objective, fact-based assessments 

of 
potentially 
paranormal 
situations.
“We just wanted to avoid 
some of the big pitfalls that some 
investigators fall into, as well as 
offer the community the best and 
most genuine service that we can,” 
Inverse said.
In the Society’s investigations 
— requests for which come in at 
least once a week — this looks 
like a very specific process. The 
process 
involves 
conducting 
an initial interview to answer 
clients’ questions and learn more 
about potential “hot spots” and 
patterns of events, setting up a 
main “base camp” area on the 
haunted property, and then setting 
up a digital video recorder system 
(DVR), computer monitor and 
video cameras.
“Once everything is set up, one 
team member will sit at the DVR 
base camp and watch the live video 
feed,” Inverse said. “If something 
pops up in the video that seems 
interesting, they will mark down 
the timestamp and camera number 
for later review. Everyone else 
will go from room to room taking 
pictures, using other specialized 
equipment such as EMF detectors 
and MEL meters, and doing EVP 
sessions.”
This process is followed by an 
in-depth evidence review by the 
team, resulting in a formal report 
for the client. All of this is free of 
charge.

In spite of, or perhaps because 
of, the depth and variety of the 
Society’s approach to investigation, 
there are some methods that they 
do not use. These include seances, 
spirit boxes, phone apps, Ouija 
boards and psychics. The reason 
is generally a lack of reliability: If 
something can be afforded a non-
paranormal explanation, such as 
wishful hearing or planchette-
pushing, it’s too easily disqualified 
as admissible.
“We want to be 100 percent 
sure that we are offering the best 
and most credible evidence to our 
clients that we can,” Inverse said. 
“We’re definitely not saying that 
some of the methods we don’t use 
can’t be used. But this field is the 
target of so much skepticism as it is, 
so if there is a natural explanation 
for a test that we use, we can never 
be sure that the result we record 
is actual evidence of something 
paranormal.”
Inverse 
has 
several 
fond 
experiences 
and 
memories 
associated with the paranormal, 
and notes that “everyone who 
enjoys this hobby has at least 
one experience that they love 
recounting.” For Inverse, standouts 
range from her first experience 
with the paranormal — a visit to a 
cemetery on Christmas Eve, where 
she captured a ghostly whisper 
(an Electronic Voice Phenomena, 
or EVP) on a camcorder — to 
her later visits to the Ohio State 
Reformatory in Mansfield, Ohio, 
and the Waverly Hills Sanatorium 
in Louisville, Kentucky.
“These places were not happy 
places,” Inverse wrote of Waverly 
and Mansfield. “Overcrowding, 
over-extended stays in solitary 
confinement and countless other 
horrors 
awaited 
inmates 
at 
(Mansfield). It’s no wonder some 
of them can’t find peace even in 
death.”
Washtenaw County specifically 
seems like a magnet for such 
unresolved histories, at least if 
you ask around. Muma pointed 
me toward the Michigan Theater 
as another spooky place where 
strange noises are said to have been 
heard late at night, and Inverse 
adds the Firehouse Museum and 
Bone Heads BBQ to the list.
“I think most cities have their 

secrets, but Ann Arbor hides hers 
better than most,” Inverse said. 
“If you talk to many of the people 
who work in the older buildings 
downtown, many have stories to 
tell about the strange things that 
make them not want to be the last 
one in the building at the end of the 
night.”

*

This past fall, Ann Arbor’s litany 
of public places, spanning from the 
Arbor Brewing Company to the 
University Bank on Washtenaw, 
found a tour guide: Sivan Jones.
Around the end of September, 
Jones decided it could be a good 
idea to set up a haunted tour of Ann 
Arbor. She did the research, going 
through local history books to 
investigating crimes and murders 
reported by the Ann Arbor Police 
Department, then figured out a 
route and set up an Airbnb page. 
The tours, which went through the 
end of November (“the Halloween 
season,” Jones called it), were an 
hour and a half long, at $22 per 
person. They were packed.
“You have the people who are 
really into the local history, but 
then you also have the people who 
really love being scared,” Jones 
said.
Her 
research 
unearthed 
a 
wide-ranging scale of creepiness. 
Some of the stories are what 
Jones deems “hearsay” accounts, 

ones she’s gleaned from personal 
conversations and word-of-mouth, 
like the little girl who is said to 
hang out in a studying cubicle 
on the lower floor of the Bentley 
Historical Library, or the woman 
who haunts the stacks of Hatcher 
Library.

“Several students have seen 
her late at night,” Jones said. “And 
multiple people have told me that. 
Again, it’s something that you can’t 
really research. I researched the 
history of the library, and nothing 
bad has ever happened there.”
The stories gleaned from Jones’s 
research range from places like 
these, personal stories that are 
tough to physically confirm, to 
well-documented 
and 
verified 
instances of unsavory history. One 
example is Randall Laboratory, 
the University’s original medical 
campus.
“They used to steal bodies,” 
Jones said. “It used to be illegal 
to use corpses for science, so they 
would have to dig up graves ... So 
they hired these shady guys, and 
they would dig up the graves and 
then bring it over to the medical 
college and sneak it into the 
building. This was for a couple 
years, until it became legal.”
This isn’t necessarily proof of 
paranormal activity, but it does 
seem to fall into place alongside the 
theories from Muma and Inverse 
about what leads to a haunted 
reputation: A twisted history.
So — aside from the education 
of local history, or the excitement 
of wanting to be scared — why 
do these twisted stories so often 
intrigue people?
Jones’s answer: “It starts with 
a character,” she said. “People 
love imagining themselves as the 
person ... I have some stories from 
the seventies, and people are much 
more scared by those than stories 
from the 1800s, because then they 
can imagine themselves as that 
person. It’s like it’s close to home. 
And then the person goes through 
something scary or something 
mysterious, and then it’s never 
quite resolved. So it gives you this 
thrill, and you don’t know if it’s 
going to happen to you.”
Often, she continued, her guests 
on tours will take this habit of 
imagining one’s own way into 

a ghost story even farther. It is 
common for tour-goers to share 
their own personal stories and 
anecdotes, whether from Ann 
Arbor or from other places they’ve 
lived.
“I really like leading the tour 
to help people connect with each 
other and share their stories, too. 
So it’s kind of like this interactive 
thing,” Jones said.
This communal exchange of 
supernatural encounters hasn’t 
only enhanced the tours; it’s 
also affected Jones personally. 
Her interest in giving tours was 
sparked by her love for Halloween 
and going to haunted houses with 
friends, but she didn’t actually 
use to believe in ghosts. Now she’s 
afraid of them.
“I started out kind of being 
skeptical, ’cause I work in a 
science-based field,” Jones said. 
“I thought it was a lot of people 
with 
overactive 
imaginations. 
But then as I went through the 
tour, I kept meeting people, and 
they just seemed like very logical, 
smart people. Like they genuinely 
had something happen to them 
that could not be explained in any 
other way. And honestly, I truly 
do believe in — I believe in the 
paranormal now, I do. Because 
these people, they weren’t pulling 
my leg or anything. They genuinely 
saw something or felt something 
or heard something, and I believe 
them.”

She even went so far as setting 
parameters: You’re welcome to tell 
your own ghost stories on the tours 
after they start back up again in 
April, just as long as you don’t make 
them too scary.

*

I was surprised, conducting 
all of these interviews, to learn 
the extent to which pockets all 
around Ann Arbor are considered 
haunted by their residents. Maybe 
this is true of every city. But even 
after living here four years, I didn’t 
know beyond a general feeling 
that dark and strange histories are 
continually existing here — many 
of them revisiting us night after 
night, repeating themselves over 
and over — around every corner.
They make themselves known 
to expert paranormal researchers, 
armed with well-tested equipment 
and years’ worth of knowledge 
and experience. They present 
themselves also to unsuspecting 
students or employees working 
late in the evening, alone and just 
trying to finish up a long night, but 
finding themselves followed by 
an unnameable other-worldliness 
that just doesn’t seem to go away. 
These are stories that are best 
told in groups, shared and bonded 
and laughed over, yet that also 
seem to prey on some of our most 
innate and instinctual senses of the 
danger that is tied to being alone.
Yet perhaps these stories, and 
the different ways they have 
found into our lives — whether 
we have witnessed them firsthand 
ourselves or still remain skeptical 
— reveal something surer about 
the sense that we fail to make of 
death. In a subjective sense, it 
seems irrational that a story or an 
experience that is unsettling by 
nature could produce some kind 
of joy or bring people together. 
But maybe the whole point is 
that there are things about living 
(and maybe about living in this 
city in particular) that we aren’t 
meant to understand, and never 
will. Sometimes all we can do is 
wade through the histories that 
inevitably surround us, sentient or 
not, invisible but thick, and listen 
honestly to the stories that we’re 
telling each other.
