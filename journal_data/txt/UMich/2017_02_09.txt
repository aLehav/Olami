Faculty and graduate students 

have recently responded with 
personal 
and 
professional 

concerns to President Donald 
Trump’s 
executive 
order 

restricting 
immigration 
from 

seven Muslim-majority countries.

The order, met with much 

opposition at the University of 
Michigan 
and 
nationallyupon 

its signing on Jan. 27, sparks 
questions as to who will and will 
not be able to travel in and out of 
the United States. It also prevents 
refugees 
from 
entering 
the 

country for at least 120 days.

Amal Fadlalla, a women’s 

studies associate professor, is 
originally from Sudan — one of 
the banned countries — but is a 
naturalized U.S. citizen. She is 
currently on sabbatical.

In an email to the Daily, 

Fadlalla noted that restrictions 
like this order “are not new.”

“After 9/11, most of these 

countries, 
mentioned 
in 
the 

new ban, were under heavy 
restrictions,” she wrote. “This ban 
made these restrictions harsher 
and more visible. For instance, 
whereas citizens from these 
specified countries entering the 
U.S. were subject to thorough 
questioning and investigation, 
now they may be denied visas or 
entry all together.”

Fadlalla said she used to 

experience questioning at the 
border because of her Sudanese 
citizenship. Once she received 

a green card and, later, U.S. 
citizenship, the questions became 
more mild. Agents would merely 
ask her where she was going, and 
what she was doing there. She said 
it helps to be affiliated with the 
University of Michigan.

Fadlalla referenced a New York 

Times article from Friday, citing 
that up to 60,000 people from 
the seven banned countries have 
had their visas revoked since the 
order’s implementation.

She also added that green-card 

holders and citizens from the 

banned countries may now be 
subject to more questioning than 
in the past.

On the national level, several 

lawsuits have been filed against 
the order. In Seattle, U.S. District 
Judge James Robart temporarily 
blocked the ban on Friday, 
deciding the ban would do more 
harm than good until a full case 
could be heard, according to NPR. 
Ann Donnelly, a federal judge 
from Brooklyn who is a University 
of Michigan alum, is among the 
judges who issued a stay on the 

ban.

With these measures in place, 

there is still uncertainty as to what 
happens next. Fadlallah wrote 
that the order should be made 
clearer so professionals from 
the banned areas who may be 
interested in coming to the United 
States, as well as those who are 
employed in the United States but 
are working in the banned areas, 
will know whether they will be 
admitted.

“Well, this (executive order) 
New legislation was introduced 

last week in the Michigan state 
Senate to remove the sales tax on 
feminine hygiene products.

Feminine 
hygiene 
products 

— which include tampons, pads 
and reusable menstrual cups — 
are classified under the tax code 
as luxury items. This means 
they are subjected to the state’s 
6-percent sales tax. However, 
Michigan’s code does exempt 
medically necessary goods, such 
as medications and catheters, 
from the sales tax. Legislators 
who proposed the bill argue that 
feminine hygiene products fall 
under this category.

An 
attempt 
was 
made 
to 

introduce similar legislation during 
last year’s session, but it did not 
get a hearing in the Senate. Sen. 
Rebekah Warren (D–Mich.), who 
was one of the four legislators to 
propose the bill, told the Daily she 
thinks this time will be different.

“This year, we’re excited because 

we had the bill (submitted) in the 
beginning of the session really 
quickly, just a few weeks after it 
started,” Warren said. “We were

A 
group 
of 
University 
of 

Michigan Engineering students 
will travel to Cuba over Spring 
Break in order to put their 
prototypes and designs to work in 
Cuban industry. The 22 students, 
led by Prof. Brian Love, are going as 
a part of the University’s innovative 
“Design in a Resource-Constrained 
Environment” course.

In a short newsletter describing 

the objectives of the course, 
students wrote that the unique 
program will allow them to 
work with Cuban resources in 
the context of an import-export 
economy.

“This 
first-of-its-kind 

engineering program is exposing 
students 
to 
the 
natural 
and 

financial resources in Cuba as they 
are linked to its import/export 
economy, as well as the current 
state of opportunities in Cuban 
industrial development,” the letter 
read.

Love wrote in an email interview 

he chose Cuba as a destination site 
for the program because of his 
experience teaching seminars at 
the University of Havana, as well

When news of the three 

racist 
emails 
from 
Tuesday 

night reached most of campus 
Wednesday morning, students, 
faculty 
and 
organizations 

immediately 
denounced 
the 

messages. Many, however, also 
criticized 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan’s response, which was 
similar to its responses to past 
racially charged acts on campus.

The emails, which were sent 

from three separate administrator 
uniqnames, claimed to address 
African-American and Jewish 
diversity in the subject lines. 
Engineering 
Prof. 
Alex 

Halderman and Ph.D. student 
Matt Bernhard were named by 
the culprit as the senders of the 
emails, however, it was later 
confirmed by Halderman he was 
not the sender. 

Two of the emails read: “Hi 

n*****s, I just wanted to say that 
I plan to kill all of you. White 
power! The KKK has returned!!! 
Heil Trump!!!!”

The other one reads: “Hi you 

fucking filthy jews, I just wanted 
to say the SS will rise again and 
kill all of your filthy souls. Die in 
a pit of eternal fire! Sincerely, Dr. 
Alex Halderman.”

The University’s Office of Public 

Affairs released a statement early 
this morning announcing the FBI 
will be working with the Division 
of Public Safety and Security in a 
joint criminal investigation.

“The university’s Information 

Assurance 
group 
also 
is 

involved in the investigation,” 
the statement reads. “The U-M 
Division of Public Safety and 
Security has increased patrols in 
the North Campus area where the 
College of Engineering is located. 
The content of the emails has been 
condemned by the university in 
general and by President Mark 
Schlissel specifically.”

In 
a 
written 
statement, 

Halderman 
denied 
being 

associated with the emails and 
said the act itself is not difficult 
to do.

“These 
messages 
were 

spoofed,” 
Halderman 
wrote.

Wednesday.

Following messages sent to school list 
servs, concerns raised over campus climate 

MATT HARMON
Daily Staff Reporter

Notable speakers included Scott Matzka, Sophia Kruz and Dr. Abdulel Sayed

Wednesday night at the Power 

Center, eight diverse speakers — 
including University of Michigan 
professors and international artists 
— discussed their unique visions 
for societal change and growth as 
a part of the annual student-run 
TEDxUofM event.

More than 1,000 students and 

residents filled the auditorium to 

hear the speakers’ ideas regarding 
the conference theme: dreamers and 
disruptors. The speakers covered a 
wide array of topics including cancer 
research, multiculturalism in a 
globalized world and educational 
reform.

One 
event 
organizer, 
LSA 

sophomore 
Hannah 
French, 

noted the theme’s aim is to cause 
introspection among the audience.

“So basically what we were 

thinking is when you’re setting out 
with an idea and you’re trying to 
make this positive change in the 
world, people are doing this usually 

in one of two ways — they’re either 
dreaming big or they’re trying to 
disrupt the status quo,” French 
said. “The theme encourages the 
audience 
to 
question 
whether 

they are a dreamer or a disruptor 
and how they can use that in their 
everyday lives.”

Among event attendees, it was 

this exposure to new ideas and 
the opportunity to engage in self-
reflection on their applicability in 
daily life that attracted many to go 
to TEDxUofM.

One such event-goer, Engineering 

senior Rachel Wallace, said events 

like TEDx bring people together 
and promote the sharing of different 
ideas, experiences and cultures. 
She further explained that the 
conference prompts people to break 
out of their social groups, and spend 
time face-to-face with new people.

“I think events like this are great 

because it gives you an opportunity 
to hear about a lot of different ideas, 
often different from your own,” 
Wallace said. “… Also the interaction 
around you and collaborating, you 
know people tend to stay within 
their own groups, and it’s a way

Jalen Rose, one of 

the members of the Fab 

Five who brought the 

University of Michigan 

men’s basketball team to 

the 1992 and 1993 NCAA 

championship games, is 

heading to prime time. 

Written and produced 

by Nahnatchka Khan of 

“Fresh Off the Boat,” 

ABC’s newest show, 

“Jalen vs. Everybody,” 

will star Rose in a semi-

autobiographical comedy.

The show centers 

around Rose after his 

career in the NBA, as well 

as his current life as a 

sports broadcaster and a 

single dad.

Since ABC already 

owns the rights to the 

NBA Finals, “Jalen vs. 

Everybody” will be a 

natural fit in the network’s 

lineup.

After bringing the 

University’s basketball 

team into the national 

spotlight along with 

Jimmy King, Chris 

Webber, Ray Jackson and 

Juwan Howard, Rose 

played for multiple teams 

in the NBA. In 2007, he 

started working as an 

analyst for ESPN, and 

in 2012 he took a job as 

one of the hosts for NBA 

Countdown.

The roles of Rose’s 

mother and grandmother 

have also been cast in the 

show.

ABC did not yet release 

information on when the 

show will premiere, but it 

will definitely be included 

in ABC’s new cycle, along 

with 10 other slated pilots.

FIRE IN THE L AB

Tuesday night, Todd Sevig, 

director of University of Michigan 
Counseling 
and 
Psychological 

Services, gave Central Student 
Government an oversight of the 
organization’s current plans to 
expand mental health services 
unique to the differing majors on 
campus.

“It’s crucial that I … as director 

of CAPS — we, as CAPS — are here, 
engaging, listening, answering 
questions,” he said. “In the last 
approximately 15 years, we’ve 
almost doubled in size. We are 
starting a national search for new 
positions. We have been newly 
funded, if you will, for six new 
positions in CAPS.”

Sevig 
emphasized 
the 

importance of faculty and students 
working 
together, 
and 
how 

CAPS is currently expanding and 
adopting new positions this year. 

“When I think of how change 

happens in the University, I’m 99 
percent convinced that sustainable 
change, lasting change, happens 
in student, faculty, staff (and) 
administrators 
all 
working 

together,” Sevig said. “We are 
your counseling center. We do not 
exist for me; we do not exist for 
the staff … We are not a private 
counseling center; we are a student 
counselling center. Whatever we 
do needs to be grounded in what 
you all think is helpful, actually 
works, actually helps you, and not 
really what we think.”

Sevig also described a new 

program being implemented at the 
University, modeled after similar 
programs at other campuses. 
The program involves assigning 
a model to each school of the 
University, in order to understand 
the unique situations in each field 

or major.

“Northwestern 
and 
the 

University 
of 
Iowa 
were 

experimenting, piloting having 
one 
of 
their 
staff 
members 

devoting part of their time to one 
school or college,” Sevig said. “The 
staff member was physically in 
that college, and would provide 
services to only those students 
and would be able to consult with 
faculty and staff. I took that idea, 
transferred it to us, and people 
liked it.”

Sevig said CAPS started 

with this process on North 
Campus 
with 
full-time 

counselors in the College of 
Engineering, the School of 
Music, Theatre & Dance and 
the School of Art & Design. It 
also implemented a step that 
involved four more specialized 
counselors in the School of 
Dentistry, the Ross School of 
Business, the Law School and 

Rackham Graduate School. 
Sevig and his team met with 
the deans of every school and 
highlighted the differences 
in experiences and sources 
of anxiety for students in 
different schools, such as 
the College of Engineering 
and Music, Theatre & Dance 
School.

There are currently plans 

in progress to expand the 
embedded model and add 
more 
counselors 
to 
the 

program, as well as increase 
the number of positions in 
Central Campus CAPS.

School of Art and Design 

Representative Abigail Zrike 
said that though she liked 
the embedded model and 
that she’s definitely seen it’s 
effect on campus, she thinks 
that 
additional 
funding 

could also go towards other 
measures, such as making it 
more convenient to schedule 
an appointment at CAPS.

“Matt and I did not send them, 
and we don’t know who did. As 
I teach in my computer security 
classes, it takes very little technical 
sophistication to forge the sender’s 
address in an email.”

In response to the emails, 

parallels are being drawn to similar 
anonymous racist acts on campus 
earlier this school year, including 
multiple 
rounds 
of 
posters 

promoting white supremacy from 
September and October.

Early 
Wednesday 
morning, 

40 protesters gathered outside 
Schlissel’s 
house 
on 
South 

University 
Avenue 
to 
demand 

action from the president. He came 
out of his home to address the 
demonstrators, affirming students’ 
protesting is crucial to combatting 
racism on campus.

“The most important thing you 

can do right now is stand together 
and call out this bullshit,” Schlissel 
said. “We’ll keep working together 
on this, because I really do need 
your help and I can’t promise 
you the world’s going to be better 
tomorrow or next week. I wish I 
could … I’m just as powerless as 
you to stop people from doing these 
things.”

The conversation has taken to 

Twitter as University sources and 
organizations post denouncements 
of the emails and, in many cases, 

criticisms 
of 
the 
University. 

Engineering senior Basel Alghanem 
tweeted his experience as a person 
of color at the University.

Alghanem wrote in an email 

interview that just because the 
route through which the hacker 
entered the email server can be 
closed doesn’t mean the problem of 
racism on campus will disappear.

“Closing an email server loophole 

doesn’t fix the real problem, 
that members of our Michigan 
community … are being attacked, 
that they don’t feel safe, and that 
this email isn’t an isolated incident,” 
he said.

On 
the 
Michigan 
Students 

Twitter account, Trevor Jones, an 
LSA sophomore, briefly took over 
the account between 8:00 and 
9:00 last night, criticizing previous 
tweets from same account. In 
multiple tweets, he wrote the 
University 
should 
meet 
these 

challenges 
head-on 
instead 
of 

tossing them to the side.

“The tweets from this account 

are unacceptable and as someone 
who has tweeted for this account 
before, 
the 
person 
currently 

tweeting did not do a very good job 
of handling the situation,” Jones 
wrote in three separate tweets. 
“This campus needs to address 
these issues. Ignoring these issues 
means being tolerant of these issues, 
and this is NOT ACCEPTABLE for 
the University of Michigan.”

Many 
professors 
addressed 

the emails in their classes on 
Wednesday. History Prof. Anne 

Berg sent a Canvas message to 
students notifying them she was 
available to talk for anyone who 
feels targeted on campus. In 
an interview, she said she sent 
the message to her students to 
make sure her classroom is a safe 
environment for students of color.

“I wanted to make sure if 

students … wanted to talk to 
someone, that I would be there 
and that they could come and talk 
to me so that they don’t feel left 
alone thinking this campus is going 
insane or something like that,” she 
said. “This is not who we are. We 
won’t let that happen. We are here 
to protect you.”

Postdoctoral 
fellow 
Austin 

McCoy studies racial justice in 
the United States, and focused his 
entire class today on unpacking the 
emails. He said the University has 
been the location of these past racist 
attacks because of the University’s 
public efforts to diversify its student 
population through its Diversity, 
Equity and Inclusion plan, a 49-part 
plan spearheaded by Schlissel 
and released last October. He also 
cited the large amount of student 
activism on campus in the past 
couple of years as a reason why trolls 
continue to target the University.

Addressing 
the 
University’s 

earlier statement, McCoy said the 
University often goes through 
a predictable pattern of digital 
response and condemnation when 
racism emerges on campus.

“From 
the 
administration, 

I anticipate them sending out 

probably an email and saying that 
they condemn the acts and then 
that they’re investigating, but other 
than that, I don’t know what else 
the administration plans to do,” he 
said.

Engineering 
senior 
Greg 

McMurtry, president of the campus 
chapter of the National Society of 
Black Engineers, echoed McCoy’s 
statements and referenced the 
posters from last semester as 
another instance of the University’s 
stunted response to acts of racism.

“(The administration is) not 

really using more than their 
statements in emails, which is 
disheartening because we had 
something similar happen in the 
fall semester so it’s upsetting and a 
little disheartening but at the same 
time, it’s expected,” he said.

In a Storify page, McCoy tweeted 

Schlissel ideas from his class 
discussion about the situation. He 
said there is a difference between 
formulating plans to combat racism 
and taking measurable action.

“(Students) see the DEI plan, 

ur 
emails, 
@umich 
diversity 

statements, but they only see that 
y’all can’t prevent hateful acts,” 
he wrote on Twitter. “Multiple 
students of color said that it’s going 
to take someone getting hurt before 
you took action.”

Elizabeth James, Afroamerican 

and 
African 
studies 
program 

associate, said she expects students 
to rise up and combat the hateful 
rhetoric displayed Tuesday night.

“Racism is based on fear of the 

other and hiding behind flyers and 
computers makes it easier in many 
ways for the perpetrators to behave 
in this heinous manner without 
being revealed for their shameless 
and reprehensible actions,” James 
wrote in an email interview. “Over 
the coming days, I believe we will 
see a rise in students mobilizing and 
speaking up about their concerns 
that this be a safe and secure 
environment.”

LSA junior Joshua Blum, chair 

of the Hillel governing board, 
said Hillel encourages the entire 
University population to speak out 
against racism toward all religions 
and races.

“We strongly condemn these 

emails and we hope that the 
University and people and all the 
students can come together and 
stand united against bigotry and 
hatred,” he said.

Hillel Executive Director Tilly 

Shames 
referenced 
an 
email 

statement she sent from Hillel 
earlier today saying actions speak 
louder than words.

“While it’s important for us to 

make this statement that we did, 
condemning this language, I think 
it’s even more important that we 
are all working to bring our campus 
community 
together,” 
Shames 

said. “In our statement, we said 
that there’s no room for this kind 
of hate on our campus. I believe as 
we fill our campus with support 
and solidarity and a strong sense of 
Michigan community, then there 
will be no space for this kind of 

hate.”

Engineering freshman Gabriel 

Shlain, 
Jewish 
Engineering 

Association president, is in his 
first semester as president of 
the association. He said that 
as of today, he has been in 
contact with other engineering 
associations across campus and 
University administrators to form 
a bridge between students and 
administration.

“I kind of feel a little bit 

responsible to make sure everyone 
who is Jewish — not only Jewish, 
but Black — that they’re represented 
and that they know that something 
is being done and we’re talking to 
other organizations and that we’re 
talking to higher up people who are 
representatives of the University to 
hopefully prevent these things,” he 
said. “Right now, our main focus is 
to have a dialogue so that we can 
then plan our actions accordingly.”

McMurtry said administrators 

should start listening to its students 
when situations like these occur.

“One 
thing 
the 
University 

really needs to start doing is when 
students come with their concerns, 
(is) follow up with those students 
and say, ‘Hey. You brought these 
concerns. We did X, Y and Z. Is this 
good? Is this what you had in mind 
or is this not what you had in mind?’ 
” he said. “Because currently, it’s 
just ‘Here’s what we’re doing. Do 
you think it’s good? Yes or no? 
Thank you for your feedback and 
we’re going to keep doing what 
we’ve been doing.’ ”

able to get a number of bipartisan 
co-sponsors, who have urged the 
chairman of the finance committee 
to have a hearing, so we’re pretty 
positive that we’ll get a hearing this 
time around.”

If 
the 
legislation 
passes, 

Michigan will join the small 
but growing list of states that 
no longer tax feminine hygiene 
products. Minnesota, Maryland, 
Massachusetts, New Jersey and 
Pennsylvania have removed the 
luxury good designation from 
tampons and pads, and several other 
states have recently introduced bills 
to do so as well. 

Though it is intended to help all 

women, supporters of the bill hope 
the legislation will especially have 
a hand in improving the lives of the 
many women of the state living in 
poverty. The average woman uses 
these products once a month for 
roughly 40 years of her life, and 
while the 6-percent sales tax may 
seem small, Warren feels it adds up.

“They’re not inexpensive, and 

they’re 
products 
that 
women 

… spend money on every single 
month, so that 6-percent tax is just 

money they aren’t spending in other 
places,” Warren said. “We have a 
pretty large percentage of women 
and children living in poverty, and 
anything that we can do to help 
those women find resources is a 
benefit.”

Joanne Bailey, a women’s studies 

lecturer specializing in women’s 
health, agrees all women should 
have easier access to menstrual 
hygiene products, considering what 
little choice women have in the 
matter.

“Of course, we shouldn’t have 

it be taxed in general,” Bailey 
said. “All women menstruate; it’s 
something all women have to pay 
for … Menstruation happens, and 
you have to manage it somehow, 
so I think that is a component of 
women’s health.”

On the other hand, as happy as 

she is about the proposed legislation, 
Bailey feels there might be more 
pressing issues for our senators to 
solve.

“In the grand scheme of things, 

this is a very small part of all our 
problems right now,” Bailey said. “If 
this were six months ago, I would’ve 
thought, ‘Woo hoo, so cool!’ … (But) 
it doesn’t solve the whole problem.

as the growing potential of STEM 
education in the country.

“After President Obama eased 

travel restrictions in December 
2014, I sought to find faculty in 
Cuba with similar backgrounds 
and experiences to me,” Love 
wrote. “My casual email/phone 
exchanges led to my being invited 
to give seminars last summer at 
the University of Havana. That 
was what led to the ‘on the ground’ 
logistics to resolve whether a 
classroom 
experience 
on 
site 

could be proposed and pulled off 
… Moreover, STEM education in 
Cuba is alive and growing.” 

Love noted that his students are 

looking to gain insight into how 
the Cuban economy functions, 
while noting new technologies and 
industry gaps. He added that many 

of his students attending speak 
fluent Spanish.

“A large fraction of engineering 

students in the program are 
bilingual in Spanish already and 
I think our Cuban counterparts 
are likely to impressed that a 
large fraction of the UM student 
ambassadors can communicate 
to them in their language,” Love 
said. “Our students are looking to 
observe the state of the art with 
regard to technology, industrial 
capacity and gaps. We also hope 
to gain insights on how the Cuban 
economy flourishes.”

Engineering junior Archit Gupta 

said the class has been preparing for 
the differences in the availability of 
resources between Cuba and the 
United States, as well as studying 
the different factors associated 
with solving engineering problems 
there. He further explained that 
the University offers numerous 
opportunities to make prototypes 

of designs, using technology not 
available in Cuba.

“We are focusing on prototyping 

and design challenges presented 
in 
a 
resource-constrained 

environment,” Gupta said. “We 
have been doing research on the 
social, economic and geographical 
factors associated with solving 
an 
engineering 
problem, 
and 

how these problems are solved 
differently in Cuba versus here in 
the states.”

Gupta described the differences 

in 
education 
styles 
between 

American and Cuban education 
systems, stating Cubans emphasize 
working on projects rather than 
focusing on creating models and 
pouring over planning. Because of 
the excess of resources, the group 
will visit science labs and medical 
centers, as well as other cultural 
centers.

“Some things we have learned 

are that there is more emphasis 

placed 
in 
learning 
theory 

compared to school here, whereas 
there is some emphasis placed in 
just doing it and getting your hands 
dirty, due to the excess in resources 
available,” Gupta said. “In Cuba, 
we are going to visit a solar farm, 
medical laboratory where there is 
some of the world’s most advanced 
lung cancer treatment, and explore 
cultural aspects of the country 
among other activities.”

Love explained that he hopes 

the trip is the first of many and that 
he can establish a collaborative link 
between research venues in Cuba 
and the University.

“Personally, I hope to establish 

UM as a viable collaborative venue 
for research, teaching and larger 
engagement with public and private 
enterprises in Cuba,” Love said. 
“Maybe there are opportunities 
to run other programs, and I hope 
to help faculty at UM and in Cuba 
build collaborative links.”

is creating so much panic and 
uncertainty for scholars, students, 
and professionals because things 
are so vague and unclear at 
the moment,” Fadlalla wrote. 
“Maybe further explanation and 
clarification will make it helpful 
for those of us who study or work 
in these regions.”

To address related concerns, the 

Middle East Studies Association, 
a national organization, issued a 
statement for faculty and students 
at higher-education institutions 
across the country.

“We condemn this Executive 

Order, which is discriminatory 
and does damage to academic 
institutions in the United States,” it 
reads.

The statement claims there have 

been conflicting guidelines as to 
the order’s impact on green-card 
holders. It also calls for continued 
support 
from 
colleges 
and 

universities.

“Academic institutions should 

prepare to make accommodations 
for students, staff and faculty 
affected by this suspension of 
entry and closely follow changes 
in the interpretation of the Order 
as legal challenges and agency 
reinterpretations 
continue 
to 

unfold,” it reads.

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel’s statement — signed 
immediately after the release of 
the executive order — affirms the 
University’s refusal to disclose the 
immigration statuses of students, 
in addition to its support of the 
international community.

In an interview with the Daily 

at the end of January, Schlissel said 
the University has been keeping up 
with related developments.

“Like the whole nation, we’re 

following very carefully — things 
that are changing quite quickly, they 
change by the hour sometimes,” he 
said. “We have staff keeping very 
close watch so we know what the 
situation is and we can best advise 

members of our community.”

In the same interview, Schlissel 

emphasized the importance of the 
contributions of immigrants at the 
University.

“The reason I really wanted 

to speak up with clarity is I don’t 
necessarily think many people 
appreciate how international — 
not just our university — but all 
the great universities are,” he 
said. “We have students from 
over 100 countries around the 
globe. The idea of excluding a 
significant fraction of the world 
as being potential members of our 
community, I think would hurt 
us.”

In response, Fadlallah wrote 

that she felt the University has 
responded to the executive order 
appropriately.

“Yes protecting our students 

and scholars who work in these 
areas is necessary,” she wrote. “I 
am very proud that the president 
and the institution stand behind 
its inclusive values of making 
connections and strengthening its 
global reach.”

Khaled Mattawa, an associate 

English professor at the University, 
is originally from Libya — another 
banned country. He immigrated to 
the United States in 1979 at the age 
of 14 and became a citizen in 1996. 
He wrote in an email interview that 
he travels to the Middle East often. 
He is currently on leave in Egypt. 

In his email, Mattawa wrote, 

as citizens, he and his family are 
not affected by the executive 
order. However, he expects to be 
interrogated upon returning to the 
United States.

He said the new regulations 

seem to point to the beginning of a 
“war against immigrants” — those 
who are naturalized and those who 
are not.

“As to my concerns, they 

run deep. I feel that these new 
regulations — I’m sure these 
are not the last word(s) on this 
matter — are part of an attempt 
to fundamentally change the 
United States, not only in its racial 
make-up but in its structure as 
a democracy,” he wrote. “Taken 

under guidance from Alt-Right 
White supremacists, this policy 
aims to bring an end to all 
immigration 
from 
Non-White 

countries.”

He noted that since 1965, 

the country has had a non-
discriminatory policy regarding 
immigration, making it the most 
diverse nation in the world — 
something that has benefited both 
the country and him personally.

However, 
he 
wrote 
that 

he believes the White House 
now supports a racist vision, 
particularly against Muslims, and 
he foresees a divide in citizenship.

“I foresee the creation (of) 

two kinds of citizenship whereby 
citizens from Muslim countries 
and other brown folks become 
second-class citizens,” he wrote. 
“The second step is perhaps to 
deny entry visas, and certainly 
citizenship, to all non-Whites ... 
You begin with Muslims because 
they’re the easiest target and you 
move down the list of undesirables. 
Yes, it’s a war against Muslims, but 
it’s racism pure and simple.”

Mattawa wrote that Egyptian 

scholars, even those whose nations 
are not affected by the executive 
order, are concerned. He said they, 
and those whose nations are on 
the list, will not come to the United 
States.

“Scholars from the current 

banned nations will seek to do 
research elsewhere,” he said. “And 
those who are already here will 
seek to leave to places that offer 
them hospitality and security.”

Mattawa feels there is no 

reason to limit immigration and 
the executive order is addressing a 
problem that is nonexistent.

“There’s no economic reason 

to limit immigration to the extent 
that the Trump administration is 
calling for,” he wrote. “And there’s 
no security reason whatsoever 
behind Trump’s executive order. 
Hardly any immigrant from the 
countries mentioned in this list 
has committed terrorism; their 
involvement in crime is almost 
nonexistent.”

Mattawa 
wrote 
that 
the 

immigrants who come to the 
United States “tend to be the best, 
most equipped and most ambitious 
individuals in the world” — echoing 
Schlissel’s claim. He said they are 
people who enter the United States 
economic system and receive no 
financial support from citizens. 

Sheira Cohen is a Rackham 

student and graduate student 
instructor from New Zealand. She 
is helping the Graduate Employees’ 
Organization negotiate a new 
contract with the University. Cohen 
specifically 
helped 
construct 

a proposal to protect graduate 
student working hours. 

Under student visas — licenses 

which most international GSIs have 
— people cannot work more than 
20 hours each week. However, by 
the University’s current contract, 
supervisors can require more than 
20 hours of work from graduate 
student instructors. The proposal 
asks to change this regulation to 
protect students from violating 
their visas.

“One of the things I think that 

makes it imperative in the current 
climate is that there are increasing 
amounts of attention being paid 
to students on visas — trying to 
find ways to take those away and 
especially scrutiny at the border 
by border officials,” she said. “If 
the University says that they want 
us and that they protect us, in 
response (to) the executive orders, 
this is a concrete way that they can 
do that.”

Cohen said she thinks the 

executive order will heighten 
the proposal’s urgency and the 
importance during its negotiations.

She said she was asked how 

many hours she worked at the 
Canadian border, and so she can’t 
imagine how much more difficult it 
would be for international students 
who are not white, or from Western 
countries.

She said the gap in the contract 

makes 
international 
students 

vulnerable at borders, and adjusting 
it would be a way for the University 
to support international students 
given the current immigration 
climate.

to break out of that shell and 
interact with people face to face 
who are different than you, meet 
new people, which I think we 
don’t do that enough, so TEDx 
really leverages all the cool ideas, 
research and experiences.”

The event led off with a talk 

by Koen Vanmechelen, a Belgian 
conceptual artist who pioneered 
the 
Cosmopolitan 
Chicken 

Research Project — an artistic and 
scientific study that works to cross-
breed different species chickens 
from around the world. According 
to Vanmechelen, the chicken is a 
metaphor for the phenomenon of 
globalization and diversity.

Vanmechelen noted that he 

believes his message will hold 
more relevance with an American 
audience than a Belgian one, 
because of the country’s current 
state of racial division.

“In the beginning, the talk is 

all chickens,” Vanmechelen said. 
“You know, it can be funny, then 
the talk is built up, and after a little 
while everyone realize how serious 
it is. What is happening with this 
country is the content of my talk, 
and I like it.”

Caitlin Holman, game designer 

and co-founder of GradeCraft, 
centered her talk around diversity 
of a different kind — the issue of 
intellectual diversity, and how 
educators can better improve their 
classrooms.

Holman said she was inspired to 

create GradeCraft because of her 
background in game design and 
her observations that people work 
longer and harder on problems 

when they are presented in a game-
like environment.

Several of the topics at the event 

dealt with issues pertaining to 
public health. Dr. Erika Newman, 
a pediatric surgical oncologist at 
the University C.S. Mott Children’s 
Hospital, spoke about the fight 
against childhood cancer — in 
particular, 
the 
neuroblastoma, 

a form of cancer that manifests 
primarily on the adrenal glands.

For Newman, cancer has always 

been a part of her life. When she 
was young, she lost her mother and 
two uncles to the disease. Newman 
said she was personally inspired 
to find a cure for neuroblastoma 
after removing a large tumor from 
the chest of a 10-year-old boy, who 
then asked why a cure did not exist 
already.

At that moment, Newman said 

she asked herself, “Why aren’t we 
aspiring for the extraordinary? 
Couldn’t we at least try?” She 
then described how these sort of 
moments in people’s experiences 
lead them to their purpose in life.

 “Our personal and professional 

experiences, 
they 
shape 
our 

dreams,” Newman said. “They lead 
us to our destiny. Our challenge is 
to be open to the clues, the quiet 
nudge that leads us to our life’s 
purpose.”

Furthering the discussion on 

public health, Dr. Abdul El-Sayed, 
the director of the Detroit Health 
Department 
and 
specialist 
in 

epidemiology, 
focused 
on 
his 

work in Detroit tackling public 
health issues such as heart disease, 
childhood asthma and accidental 
pregnancy.

L

ast 
Monday, 
United 

States Supreme Court 
Justice Sonia Sotomayor 

and Justice Susanne 
Baer of the Federal 
Constitution Court 
of Germany hosted 
a talk sponsored by 
the School of Music, 
Theatre 
& 
Dance 

about the role of 
the performing arts 
in advancing social 
justice. The event 
aimed 
to 
discuss 

the pivotal role of 
the arts in defining 
the 
human 
condition 
and 

bringing about justice, and 
featured student performances 
that aspired to demonstrate 
the powerful ability of art to 
foster understanding and make 
the world a better place. The 
justices’ discussions further 
served 
to 
emphasize 
the 

importance and necessity of the 
arts in our world. The evening 
felt like an impassioned and 
convincing plea for society 
to remember the value of 
the arts. It was particularly 
timely, 
considering 
recent 

rumors that President Trump 
will eliminate the National 
Endowment for the Arts, the 
National Endowment for the 
Humanities 
and 
privatize 

the Corporation for Public 
Broadcasting. 

During the discussion, the 

speakers raised the subject 
of the relationship between 
government and the arts. Baer, 
speaking 
about 
Germany’s 

attitude 
toward 
public 

funding for the arts, said she 
thought government support 
for the arts demonstrated 
that the arts are “part of our 
civic society.” She said that in 
Germany, arts are something 
that cities are proud to fund, 
because they provide a source 
of “who we are.” 

In contrast, Sotomayor said 

that the United States has less 
of a tradition of public support 
for the arts, and that most U.S. 
cities fund their arts through 
the generosity of the public. She 
emphasized that it is part of our 
civic responsibility to support 
art. Still, Baer raised the idea 
that a compromise between 
public and private funding might 
be preferable, since many artists 
need a steady source of income.

Regardless of where funding 

for the arts comes from, the 
justices agreed that art holds 

a 
unique 
and 

special 
power 
to 

communicate 
the 

incommunicable. 
Sotomayor said art 
can touch the soul. 
Baer said art is not 
just a product, but it 
can “reach out beyond 
what we usually reach 
out to.” They spoke 
powerfully 
about 

their 
experiences 

with art, and how those 

experiences shaped them.

Baer said she was “in awe 

seeing 
the 
multiplicity 
of 

human 
expression 
through 

music.” Further, music speaks 
to her “on another dimension 
that (she) couldn’t understand 
otherwise.” Sotomayor said her 
most deeply felt views on the 
criminal justice system came 
from a spoken word project by 
the Innocence Project. She said 
performance moved her “to 
think more broadly about how 
our criminal justice system 
affects our society than any of 
(her) readings at night.”

Sotomayor’s perspective on 

our criminal justice system 
was 
profoundly 
shaped 
by 

one 
performance, 
and 
her 

position on the issue in turn 
has been, and will continue 
to be, reflected in Supreme 
Court decisions that shape the 
criminal justice system. This 
alone should be proof enough 
of the value of the arts. But art 
doesn’t haven’t to affect the 
opinions of one of the world’s 
most important legal minds 
to have a significant, positive 
impact.

Take, for example, Carla 

Dirlikov Canales, an Ypsilanti 
native and world renowned 
opera singer. Canales spoke 
at the event about how artists 
can be teachers, educators and 
healers, not just entertainers. 
She 
would 
know, 
having 

founded the Canales Project 
to “give voice to issues of 
identity and culture through 
the arts and conversation.” 
She has been named to Foreign 
Policy’s 100 Leading Global 
Thinkers of 2015 and has 
served as a cultural envoy for 
the U.S. Department of State. 
Before she began her beautiful 

performance of “Habanera” 
from 
“Carmen,” 
Canales 

implored 
the 
audience 
to 

remember that the arts allow 
us to explore the common 
human condition, and that this 
is especially vital in currently 
divided times.

Overall, 
the 
event 
was 

compelling in its advocacy for 
the indispensable role that 
art plays in our lives and in 
society. Of course, it was a 
prime example of “preaching to 
the choir.” I would be shocked 
if anybody in the small crowd 
who bought tickets to see an 
event called “Social Justice and 
the Performing Arts” doubted 
the importance of the arts. The 
self-selection of this event, and 
many similar ones that take 
place on college campuses all 
the time, is a shame, because I 
think some skeptics might have 
been converted.

I, for one, can easily call 

to mind the powerful ways 
that art has shaped my view 
of the world. Whether it be 
rap music, foreign films or 
musicals, art has taught me a 
lot about the world and made 
me 
a 
more 
compassionate 

person. I urge everyone to 
think about how art has shaped 
their lives and consider what 
role we as a country should 
play in promoting the arts. 
Do we think that we should 
leave the arts entirely to will 
of 
the 
public’s 
generosity, 

even if this means that art 
might increasingly become the 
product of elite preferences? 
Do we think that cutting 
funding 
for 
the 
National 

Endowment for the Arts, the 
National Endowment for the 
Humanities 
and 
privatizing 

the Corporation for Public 
Broadcasting is necessary, even 
if they only compose less than 
one-tenth of 1 percent of the 
federal budget?

As 
the 
Trump 

administration’s 
radical 

changes to our country keep 
coming at lightning speed, 
don’t let these potential cuts 
go unnoticed. The arts might 
not be as critical of an issue as 
immigration or health care, but 
the role they play in our society 
is large and irreplaceable.

D

ear President Schlissel, 

This semester I am 

teaching a course titled 

“Resisting State Violence: Race, 
Policing and Social Justice in 
Twentieth 
Century 
America,” 

offered in the departments of 
History and Afroamerican and 
African Studies. As an instructor 
on race and racism, I try to 
offer all of my students space 
to talk frankly and historically 
about current events, whether 
the conversation is about the 
relationship 
between 
past 

immigration 
policies 
and 

President 
Trump’s 
executive 

order banning refugees, or the 
recent racist and anti-Semitic 
emails sent to engineering and 
computer science students.

We 
talked 
about 
those 

emails, as well as the incident 
concerning the defiled prayer rug 
in the Shapiro Undergraduate 
Library Reflection Room in class. 
Many students of color were 
upset. Many of them, along with 
their white peers, expressed the 
same concern and anger as those 
who gathered in front of your 
house shortly after the emails 
were received. Multiple students 
expressed a lack of confidence 
in the Diversity, Equity and 
Inclusion plan and the University 
of Michigan’s ability to identify 
perpetrators of violent speech. 
Some even went as far to say 
that it may take someone getting 
hurt before the University would 
take recognizable action. Those 

comments troubled me and I am 
sure they would trouble you.

I 
understand 
that 
such 

comments could sting, but they 
illustrate a persistent gap in 
trust between some students of 
color and the administration, 
despite the University’s DEI 
efforts. Many will not deny 
the University’s long-term DEI 
plans or your willingness to 
offer assurance via email and in 
person. I even recognize your 
efforts to support undocumented 
students 
in 
anticipation 
of 

changes in federal immigration 
policy. 
But 
several 
of 
my 

students also see that the 
University does not appear to 
be able to prevent the hateful 
acts targeted at marginalized 
communities on campus.

Another sentiment that some 

students of color expressed is 
one that civil rights activist 
Fannie Lou Hamer famously 
uttered in a 1964 speech, “I’m 
sick and tired of being sick and 
tired.” Some spoke of being tired 
with hearing the response, “We 
are investigating,” with little 
update or ability to locate racist, 
Islamophobic, misogynistic and 
anti-Semitic trolls. Some of the 
students in class expressed how 
they were growing tired with 
appealing to administration to 
little effect on their lives. Some 
even expressed how they were 
tired of you asking them what 
you could do. They are obviously 
seeking inspired leadership, at 
least. They also desire tangible 
changes 
and 
results, 
sooner 

rather than later.

So, 
what 
can 
you 
do? 

Unfortunately, I do not have any 
answers. I wish I did because 
we all want everyone here at the 
University to work and live in 
an environment free of racism, 
Islamophobia, 
anti-Semitism, 

misogyny and other forms of 
oppression. What I heard in class 
is a desire for clearer and more 
constant communication. The 
students I listened to effectively 
said that responses that point to 
the broader context of bigotry in 
the country are insufficient.

They are looking for you to talk 

directly about these incidents 
in a manner that illustrates 
a constant engagement with 
their daily experiences. They 
understand campus and outside 
authorities may be investigating. 
But, maybe some students of color 
would appreciate more continual 
updates 
about 
investigations 

and 
the 
University’s 
efforts 

to prevent hateful incidents. 
And I understand there may be 
legal and institutional limits 
to such a request, but the more 
communicative and transparent 
you can be, the more you can 
close the gap in trust. As you 
know, closing this gap in trust 
between students of color and 
the administration should garner 
more buy-in and goodwill for DEI 
efforts, but it will also be the key 
toward building a more inclusive 
and equitable campus climate for 
years to come.

Single on Valentine’s Day

MICHAEL SUGERMAN | COLUMN

S

uggestion: listen to Gilbert 
O’Sullivan’s “Alone Again 
(Naturally)” as you read 

for full effect.

A 
“secret 

admirer” 
recently 

left me a red teddy 
bear 
holding 

a 
plush 
heart 

inscribed with the 
word “kiss,” along 
with a note that 
says they can’t stop 
thinking about me. 
True story. I still 
have no clue who it 
is. I’m touched (and 
a bit scared). I hope one of my 
friends isn’t just screwing with 
me. I think one of my friends is 
just screwing with me.

Secret admirer aside — if 

you’re 
reading 
this, 
reveal 

yourself! — my college love 
prospects have been pretty 
dim. To be quite honest, I don’t 
think college is a very romantic 
place. I often find that there 
are two extremes: the people 
who date for four years and 
are destined for marriage and 
the sloppy drunken hookups 
we see at parties and on the 
dance floors of bars. They’re 
so 
common, 
there 
is 
an 

Instagram account dedicated 
to documenting them.

Let’s not forget Tinder. Who 

knew that romance could be 
as industrial as a rightward 
swipe and a “match?” With a 
handful of carefully curated 
pictures and a brief bio, we 
transcend 
the 
mystery 
of 

fleeting imagination and make 
contact, often with complete 
strangers. Some have told me 
they legitimately use Tinder 
for dating; others say they use 
it to feed hookup culture.

Here’s something I think 

about often: My dad’s parents 
started dating each other in 
10th grade. They were 15. 
That’s nuts! My mom’s parents 
married 
right 
before 
my 

grandmother graduated from 
college. She was the same age I 
am now! Look — I’m 21 and I’m 
not dating at the moment. I’m 
about to graduate from college 
and I’m likely going to move to 

a new city instead of returning 
home. Is this really the time to 
pursue a new relationship?

Valentine’s 
Day 

quickly 
approaches, 

and though I know 
it’s 
a 
fabricated 

Hallmark 
holiday, 

it encapsulates the 
mounting 
pressure 

I feel. How many of 
your 
parents 
have 

asked you if you’re 
dating 
anyone? 

Have any of your 
grandparents tried to 
set you up?

My grandfather called me 

last week and told me the 
granddaughter 
of 
a 
friend 

in his Torah study group is 
a 
University 
of 
Michigan 

student. He was trying to be 
helpful, which I appreciate, 
but imagine that introduction: 
“Hi there, we’ve never met, but 
our Jewish grandparents hang 
out weekly and want us to wed. 
Are you ready to start the rest 
of our lives together?” I can 
hear “Tradition” from “Fiddler 
on the Roof” playing in the 
background.

All of life, I think, is a search 

for intimacy, and from talking 
with friends, it seems clear that 
I’m not the only one struggling 
to find it. The pressure isn’t 
just a matter of age or well-
intentioned family members. 
I think we’re so used to being 
plugged in, surrounded by 
others and even hyper-aware 
of their relationships, that we 
forget the importance of being 
comfortable with ourselves.

A couple of weekends ago, I 

stayed in New York City. I have 
some high-school friends there 
whom I visited, but a great deal 
of my time was spent alone 
in the city. The pure thought 
of that was a bit terrifying to 
me. How could I enjoy myself 
without 
someone 
to 
enjoy 

myself with?

When I was a little kid, I 

loved being on my own. I’d 
come home and spend hours in 
my room, playing with Thomas 
the Tank Engine figures when 
I was really young, and later 

moved on to Legos. I loved 
that time the most; person-
to-person interactions could 
be exhausting, and sometimes 
all I needed to decompress 
were my favorite toys and my 
imagination.

I tried to channel that 

dormant part of myself while 
I was in the city, and to my 
surprise, it was a success. 
I stuck in my headphones, 
jammed to one of my favorite 
playlists, and walked. I bought 
a $2 hot dog with ketchup and 
mustard, and I enjoyed the 
hell out of it. I went to an art 
museum and worked through 
each of its exhibits over the 
course of three hours. I think 
I’d forgotten that I can be fun 
to hang out with.

All 
things 
considered, 

this column is both personal 
catharsis and reassurance for 
those of you who are in the same 
boat right now. This Valentine’s 
Day, don’t be ashamed if you’re 
not taking a significant other 
out to dinner somewhere in 
downtown Ann Arbor to show 
that you care. Don’t worry 
that your grandparents were 
already on the verge of having 
children when they were in 
this stage of life.

I conducted some minor 

research on this, and according 
to one psychologist, “The more 
obsessed and ruminative a 
person may be about obtaining 
a partner or finding new 
romantic attention, the more 
depleted and inadequate they 
may feel about themself.”

Sometimes, the person you 

should get to know better is 
 
… you. So, put in the time. 
Grab a cup of coffee. Get a 
box of chocolates. Go to an art 
museum. Listen to some new 
tunes. Some will call it denial 
(and it may be, at least a little 
bit), but I’ll call it self-care.

Relationships with others 

can be fulfilling, frustrating, 
fleeting and so much more — 
but you are your own inevitable 
constant. Embrace it.

Thursday, February 9, 2017 — 5

As far as style goes, January 

2017 is the month of the man. The 
fashion industry raked in millions 
after shows in Paris, Milan, New 
York, Florence — you name it. 
The farthest reaching fashion 
media 
feeds 
gave 
menswear 

its due, Vogue publishing its 
usual glorious photo slides of 
each collection and hundreds of 
articles were published raving 
over or criticizing this season’s 
batch. Yet as relevant as it may 
be, I simply haven’t kept up with 
men’s fashion, really at all in 
comparison to the way I keep up 
with women’s fashion. The most 
I’d seen or paid attention to it was 
in unisex collections or styles 
because simply put, androgyny is 
in. 

But before scrolling through 

the slides of the most popular, 
recent runway collections whose 
designers I’d at least heard of, I 
made a number of assumptions 
about my expectations for modern 
menswear, namely in comparison 
to womenswear. It would be more 
practical, less flashy and, above 
all, boring (sexist, I know). But 
upon finally thinking about it and 

scrolling through the collections, 
I wondered why I hadn’t at least 
viewed 
men’s 
fashion 
week. 

From a personal standpoint, I 
buy plenty of men’s clothing at a 
thrift store and would agree the 
men’s section has infinitely better 
sweaters. 
Entertainment-wise, 

the spectacle of menswear runway 
shows rival the finesse, detail and 
extravagance exhibited in any 
women’s runway collection. The 
men’s fashion industry currently 
stands valued at $440 billion and 
incredibly famous and acclaimed 
designers like Raf Simmons and 
Marcus Wainwright made their 
debut in menswear.

So here are a few thoughts of 

my favorite menswear collections 
of the season, interpreted by an 
almost completely blank slate.

Nick Graham, apparently the 

maker of some of the greatest 
suits to walk the earth, debuted a 
Mars-themed collection for New 
York Fashion Week, hosted by, 
you guessed it, actually probably 
not: Bill Nye. The patterns and 
colors were bold and inventive 
but just understated enough to 
maintain the integrity of a dressy, 
professional suit. I completely 
agree with the hype.

Raf 
Simmons: 
because 
of 

his work with Dior and Calvin 

Klein, this is biased in his favor. 
His 
recent 
immigration 
and 

succession of Calvin Klein has 
garnered plenty of attention. 
Regardless of whether or not his 
menswear collection expressed 
any of the recent uproar in regards 
to American immigration policy 
or sentiment about his new status 
as a U.S. citizen, the collection 
was unmistakably themed with 
pieces like an unforgettable “I 
heart New York” sweater and 
working class overcoats donned 
by especially thin models. His 
work was oversized, occasionally 
cinched with caution tape and 
plastic belts emboldened with 
trademark New York sayings. 
Much of it included exciting 
graphics and a remarkably unisex 
appeal.

Hugo Boss, unfortunately, was 

what I expected to dislike about 
menswear. Everything was clean-
cut but nothing remotely exciting. 
Maybe I’m simple-minded or 
misinformed for wanting some 
color, any color.

My 
brief 
encounter 
with 

menswear forces me to conclude 
that I’ve been missing out. As 
womenswear 
and 
menswear 

continue to collide and mix, 
menswear 
just 
might 
reign 

supreme one of these days.

New York Fashion Week 
2017: Men’s in review

Men’s Fashion Week in New 

York was an eventful time — with 
shows representing every designer 
from Fear of God to Vetements 
(seriously, check this one out). 
While there are many shows worth 
discussing, I want to focus on 
NYFW:M on a broader scale:

Raf Simons
Raf unveiled his Fall 2017 Men’s 

Collection in New York this past 
week. Having recently moved to 
New York for his new position at 
Calvin Klein, he seemed to draw 
from the feel of New York City, 
combining boxy and checkered 
topcoats with “I heart NY” 
sweaters. “I wanted to go back to 
how I experienced New York in the 
beginning and combine it with how 
I experience it now. So this fresh 
young direction to the city and 
everything it stands for—and what 
is happening now,” Simons said 
when asked about his inspiration for 
the show in Vogue. In reference to 
the current political climate, Vogue 
asked Simons if President Donald 
Trump’s election has influenced 
his work, and while he says it has 
not, his desire to represent the 
rich history of the city and all of its 
people is an inherent celebration 
of the immigrant narrative in this 
country. “Ask me do I think that 
you should stand up against what 
is happening in this country, then I 
say yes,” he also added. 

While Simons gave credit to 

the beauty of the city and its rich 
history, it wasn’t the NYC sweaters 
that stood out to me. The detail 
that made many of the looks was 
the cinching on the outerwear. It’s 
something that has become a staple 
of many Dries van Noten shirts, and 
it really allows some outerwear, 
that could otherwise be viewed as 
somewhat plain, to shine.

Simons’ coverage in the news 

has not been exclusive to his 
eponymous line, though. Calvin 
Klein has also been making waves 
these past few weeks, giving the 
Belgian designer a jam-packed 
schedule. Coming off of showing 
his first designs since taking over 
as Calvin Klein’s Chief Creative 
Officer, where they announced 
that customers could schedule 
appointments for made to measure 
clothing, the fashion house recently 
took to Instagram to let the world 
know that they have changed their 
logo. This is all in anticipation for 
the Fall/Winter 2017 ready-to-
wear collection which is set to show 
on February 10th in New York.

The Runway Gets Political
There has never been a more 

fitting time for fashion shows to be 
in New York than this past week. 
While President Donald Trump’s 
proposed immigration ban was 
sending 
shockwaves 
through 

the country, there were dozens 
of fashion houses with foreign 
designers, foreign employees and 
foreign models showing their 
collections for, among other people, 
Americans. To me, it perfectly 
encapsulates the point that many 

people have tried to drive home 
over the last week: Our country is 
strengthened by all of the people 
from all over the world who come 
here to have an impact. While most 
of these designers will soon return 
to their respective countries, they 
did not waste any time to voice 
their opinions (both on the runway 
and off).

Detroit-raised designer John 

Varvatos told the New York Times, 
“Half the people in my company are 
from someplace else” in response to 
Trump’s executive order, echoing 
the fears of many people in this 
country, especially as we await the 
court decision on the ban. Of the 
most on-the-nose demonstrations 
on the runway, Nick Graham 
welcomed Buzz Aldrin and Bill 
Nye to his Mars-themed show, 
where Nye addressed those who 
deny climate change. Meanwhile, 
Robert Jamesmade statements on 
the immigration ban, with models 
sporting signs with messages like 
“Made in a Sanctuary City” or 
“Bridges not Walls.” Both can be 
seen here.

Fashion, like other forms of art, 

can be a powerful way to send a 
message. There are thousands of 
people who go to the shows, write 
about them online and end up 
purchasing the items when they 
hit stockists. For many people in 
the United States and around the 
world, this is a tumultuous time, 
and it’s reassuring to see designers 
using their platforms to express 
their discontent, even at the 
potential cost of customers.

NYFW designers consider political implications of fashion

DAILY FOOD COLUMN

There are no quick & easy 
shortcuts in the kitchen 

Don’t be mislead by those Tasty videos — fast and good are 
mutually exclusive according to the Daily’s food columnist

When it comes to cooking, 

fast and good are generally 
mutually exclusive. By fast, 
I’m not talking about the 
impossible rate at which Iron 
Chef contestants chop carrots 
(At the speed of light. Don’t 
fact check that). I’m talking 
about clickbait articles like “10 
Cooking Shortcuts Everyone 
Needs to Know” or “30 Dinners 
in Under 30 minutes.”

Fast and easy are often used 

interchangeably, but lists of 
tips and tricks that boast speed 
are the ones to look out for. Yes, 
maybe some recipes are more 
easily and quickly prepared 
than others, but by nature, not 
by method. If you’re taking 
more than several minutes 
to fry an egg, you’re probably 
doing something wrong.

As food and cooking have 

becoming increasingly present 
online and on social media, 
the 
discussion 
surrounding 

them has changed. We’re a 
technologically driven society 
obsessed with what’s fast and 
easy. We don’t have time to 
dedicate to cooking — we’d 
rather have our Apple Watch 
make our dinner for us or 
watch someone make dinner in 
a Tasty video instead.

“Drunk Uncle” digression 

aside, I’m here to tell you (in 
my very professional opinion) 
that in cooking, as with life, 
there are no shortcuts. That’s 
right, call your mom to tell 
her she was right. Alert the 
press. Or just tweet about 
it. There are no shortcuts. 
Stop microwaving your eggs 
and putting frozen chicken 
straight into the pan (it has 
to thaw first, c’mon). While 
some shortcuts are kitchen 
experiments executed at the 
hands 
of 
desperate, 
time-

crunched cooks, others are 
much more nefarious. Into the 
latter category fall clickbait 
disguised 
as 
time-saving 

hacks. 
Less 
experienced 

cooks fall victim to these 

hacks, shaping their culinary 
experience with two-bit tricks 
designed 
to 
garner 
views 

rather than inform readers. 

Growing up, I frequently 

visited my grandmother for the 
sole purpose of learning how to 
make her signature rugelach. 
They were fluffy, oozing with 
a rich chocolate filling and 
sprinkled with a sugar, butter 
and flour mixture that turned 
golden brown in the oven. They 
bore little resemblance to the 
dense, dry cookies of the same 
name sold in many grocery 
stores and even traditional 
bakeries. 
They 
were 
an 

entity of their own, stealthily 
categorized 
in 
the 
same 

group of recipes defining the 
traditional Ashkenzi pastry. 

The process of making these 

rugelach-sweet 
bun 
hybrid 

was nothing short of involved 
(mostly on my grandma’s part 
as I was only seven or eight 
at the time of my interest in 
making these treats). To save 
me the anticipation of waiting 
for the dough to rise — I was, 
predictably, quite impatient 
during the whole ordeal — 
my grandma would make the 
dough the night before. To this 
day, I still don’t know how she 
made it.

It was just this magical, 

massive ball of risen yeast 
and flour that was revealed 
in its enormous bowl under a 
checkered towel every time I 
arrived for our day of baking. 

I was in awe of the bowl’s 
contents. Somehow, by some 
process of adding ingredients 
and shaping them, my grandma 
created the foundation for 
what we would spend hours 
assembling 
and 
baking. 
It 

was hard for my young mind 
to grasp the actual work that 
went into making something 
like that, and looking back now, 
I regret taking it for granted.

To assemble the rugelach, 

we’d 
carefully 
roll 
out 

the dough and cut it into 
triangles, slather each piece 
generously 
with 
chocolate 

spread (something mysterious 
that came out of a plastic tub 
with Hebrew lettering) and 
roll them up before dabbing 
them with melted butter and 
sprinkling the crumb topping 
over them.

Waiting for the rugelach 

to rise again then bake was 
agonizing. I would watch the 
oven and try to will it to turn 
the dough golden brown faster. 
It was a trying several minutes 
even waiting for them to cool 
out on the counter once the 
fragrant, 
steaming 
pastries 

were removed from the oven. 

This process took countless 

hours of preparation, but it 
was worth it. Not just for the 
final result, but for the time 
spent making them (however 
impatiently 
passed). 
The 

memory of making rugelach 
is one that I hold on to dearly. 
No shortcut could replace or 
even resemble that. In an era of 
increasing instant gratification 
and dissociation from reality, 
it’s easy to forget that cooking, 
however 
time-straining, 
is 

a grounding and nourishing 
process. Using shortcuts only 
detracts from its benefits.

Rather than following those 

“lazy cooks” guides for “quick 
and easy meals,” try making 
your meal with a different 
adjective. And please, please 
stop using the microwave to 
cook raw food.

SHIR 

AVINADAV

Can we dig a six-foot-deep 

ditch 
for 
ill-fitting, 
light-

wash, 
high-wasted 
jeans? 

Specifically, 
those 
that 

resemble 
something 
your 

grandpa would wear to senior 
breakfast with a matching 
pair of white orthopedic New 
Balances.

While mindlessly perusing 

the internet, I came across an 
image of Malia Obama on her 
first day of her new internship 
with the Weinstein Company 
in New York City. The image 
was upsetting. First, because 
it served as an unwanted 
reminder that I still do not have 
an internship for this summer 
(yes, mom, I am working on 
it). But primarily because she 
was wearing a pair of jeans so 
heinous your mother wouldn’t 
even touch them. I’ve seen 
these jeans walking around 
every day, but this particular 
pair heartily shoved me over 
the edge. Their unabashed 
ugliness served as a gamma-
ray machine, transforming me 
from a mild-mannered style 
writer into a green monster 
seething with distaste for the 
style.

If you have a pair of mom 

jeans, I implore you to burn 
them.

The appeal of mom jeans 

lies in their rebellion. To my 

knowledge, no one has ever 
purchased mom jeans under 
the impression that they are 
good looking. What makes 
them cool is their ugliness, and 
the undaunted attitude that 
accompanies wearing them. I 
think this notion of “cool” is a 
fallacy. 

You have to have a semblance 

of originality to be a non-
conformist. Mom jeans, once 
bold and unique, have firmly 
dug their gnarly toes into 
the mainstream mud. Their 
moment has passed. No one 
is applauding your sartorial 
bravery 
and 
distinction; 

unfortunately, 
because 
the 

trend has become so widely 
adopted, you’re left looking 
unoriginal.

I should clarify, my main 

issue is not that they are 
fundamentally 
unflattering. 

I 
subscribe 
wholeheartedly 

to 
man-repelling, 
wearing 

aggressive 
and 
eccentric 

styles even if — especially if 
— they are deemed ugly by the 
opposite sexW. At the core of 
man-repelling (a term coined 
by Leandra Medine) is the 
notion of dressing exclusively 
for yourself based singularly 
on your personal style.

My dispute with the pants 

is that I perceive them as a 
superficial imitation of this 
stance. When I see a girl 
wearing baggy trousers, I do 
not view it as an empowered 
statement, a declaration of 
independence from a beauty-
oriented 
style 
of 
dressing. 

When I see a girl wearing them, 
I view it as an appropriation of 
a trend in an obvious attempt 
to look alternative.

There’s nothing less cool 

than trying desperately hard 
to look cool.

However, I may be in the 

minority on this. The article in 
which I initially saw the image 
lauded 
Malia. 
Comparing 

her 
outfit 
to 
something 

that 
Rihanna 
would 
wear 

(primarily for her choice of 
coat and shoes, but still). And 
this was Vogue, no less. All 
fashion is subjective if you 
wear mom jeans and love ‘em, 
you’re in your rights to tell me 
to ‘eff off.

It’s easy to forget that music 

can be as therapeutic for the artist 
to make as it is for the listener to 
experience. Sampha Sisay proves 
this true on his debut LP, Process. 
It’s a testament to his gorgeous, 
versatile vocals; an impressive 
display of the beauty that can rise 
from pain. Sisay’s mother passed 
away from cancer in 2015, and 
that tragedy, in a way, makes this 
album. Themes of grief and heavy 
emotions run everywhere.

But Process is only heart-

wrenchingly 
powerful, 
never 

overdramatic.

The album opens with “Plastic 

100°C,” a passionate introduction 
to a similarly raw album. Like 
“Demons” from Dual, Sampha’s 
second EP, “Plastic 100°C” starts 
with a clip of a voice recording 
before cycling into the actual 
song. Plucking, harp-like notes 
lend the piece a hypnotic, ethereal 
feeling that sparks the detailed 
lyrical imagery, while escalating 
instrumentals 
intensify 
and 

advance the song. “It’s so hot I’ve 
been melting out here / I’m made 
out of plastic out here / You touched 
down in the base of my fears,” he 
sings, with feverish anxiety in his 
voice. Even more striking is the 
unhurried, vulnerable bridge of 
the piece, which contrasts sharply 
with the organized chaos of the 

first few minutes.

“Blood On Me,” the second 

track and first single on Process, 
came about because of a terrifying 
dream, and it’s audible in Sampha’s 
voice. The song begins breathlessly, 
then grows in both intensity and 
feeling. The faster pace of the piece, 
quick, drumming instrumentals 
and hypnotizing, almost cinematic 
descriptions of the beings chasing 
him combine in trepidation, yet 
create a mesmerizing dream that 
gradually swallows the listener.

Process shares some of the 

same stylistic qualities prevalent 
in 2013’s Dual, like 
a heavy reliance 
on 
electronic 

instrumentals and 
a prancing piano, 
but the difference 
between the two 
is in their tone. 
Dual is unfailingly 
melodious and bright, even at its 
moodiest, possessing barely any of 
the dark, somber earnestness that 
dominates Process.

“Take Me Inside” may be the 

shortest track in the album, but 
it’s one of the most beautiful. 
It’s slower paced than most of 
Process, a quality that emphasizes 
the 
light, 
delicate 
dance 
of 

Sampha’s higher octaves. His 
voice’s smooth transitions bring to 
mind the composed strength of a 
ballerina, filled with a calm grace 
that belies the effort required to 
perfect such skill. The latter half 

of the song sounds as if Sampha 
were accompanied by a chorus 
of starlit angels. The beauty of 
the song never detracts from its 
weight though: “And I seek / I’m 
seeking something I can’t see / I 
may be reading in too deep / And 
maybe this is all a dream,” Sampha 
croons, leaving the listener with 
an immersive, echoing melancholy 
that sticks.

Sampha’s 
range 
is 
almost 

limitless. 
“Under” 
is 
an 

intentionally tumultuous track, 
with 
an 
echoing 
beginning 

reminiscent of Dual’s “Beneath 

The Tree,” while 
“(No One Knows 
Me) 
Like 
The 

Piano” 
strips 

away 
most 
of 

the 
electronic 

instrumentals 
that are present in 
practically 
every 

other track, leaving Sampha’s 
voice to amble along at it’s own 
heartfelt pace accompanied by a 
single piano.

With a steady hand, Sampha 

takes 
listeners 
through 
a 

mesmerizing journey that gets 
down to the grit of what makes 
us human. Instead of shying 
away from pain that’s often 
hard to discuss, much less sing 
about, he embraces it. Process is a 
magnetizing reminder that music 
is inseparable from emotion and 
an affirmation that grief, at its 
rawest, is universally understood.

A session of therapy: 
Sampha’s own ‘Process’

Mesmerizing new album proves cathartic and transcendent

Much 
of 
the 
stigma 
that 

surrounds young adult novels is 
undeserved. People point to the 
tired tropes of the most laughable 
YA novels as being representative 
of the whole genre—love triangles, 
mean boys in leather jackets who 
secretly love you, bland female 
protagonists named Elektra or 
Aurora or whatever, nouns being 
unnecessarily capitalized in the 
place of actual worldbuilding, etc. 
And yes, these tropes are pervasive 
and annoying, but they’re window 
dressing. They’re never at the 
heart of what makes teenagers love 
young adult books.

Cliche is not the same thing 

as bad. If this were true, then I 
guess we all would really hate 
“Star Wars.” After all, it’s home 
to all those dumb tropes like love 
triangles, mean boys in leather 
jackets, 
and 
the 
egregiously 

capitalized Empire and Republic. 
Many of the surface-level YA 
criticisms have much more to do 
with derision of teenage girls and 
the things made for/written by 
women than they do concerns 
over actual literary quality. But I 
digress.

What I’m trying to get at here 

is that a book that features corsets 
and enchantments and not one but 
two mean boys in leather jackets 
with hidden hearts of gold is not 
inherently dumb or bad. Silly? 
Yes. Ridiculous wish-fulfillment 
fantasy? Absolutely. Fun as hell? 
But of course.

Stephanie Garber’s “Caraval” is 

400 pages of pure pulpy joy. The 
protagonist, Scarlett (spoiler: she 
wears many red dresses, because 

of course she does) is the daughter 
of a powerful, ruthless, and violent 
man who terrorizes her and her 
sister Tella (short for Donatella, 
because of course it is). Scarlett is 
engaged to be married to a man 
she has never met, but she secretly 
dreams of seeing Caraval, an 
annual performance where the 
audience participates in a Hunger 
Games minus the murder (well, 
kind of) style of competition. 
Caraval is a weeklong experience 
in which participants stay on a 
magical island where they solve 
a series of riddles, 
competing to see 
who can get to the 
end of the puzzle 
first. With the help 
of the mysterious 
sexpot 
sailor 

Julian 
(Leather 

Jacket 
Boy 
#1), 

Scarlett and Tella 
are whisked away 
to the show, where Tella is 
immediately kidnapped by the 
magical mastermind/organizer of 
the event, Legend. In this year’s 
competition, whoever finds Tella 
first is the winner of the Caraval. 
It’s up to Scarlett, with the help 
of Julian, to find Tella and return 
home in time for her wedding.

“Caraval” is so easy to poke fun 

of. In this novel, there is no such 
thing as too many adjectives or too 
many synonyms for the color red (I 
mean, “cerise?” Really?). There is—
no joke—a character named Dante 
(Leather Jacket Boy #2, duh) who 
has completely unironic tattoos of 
black roses and falcons on the backs 
of his hands and neck. There are 
many, many extended sequences 
of Scarlett and Leather Jacket 
Boys being forced into increasingly 
hilarious situations where they 

have to stand really really close 
together and make breathtaking 
eye contact. At one point, Scarlett 
says the word “scoundrel” with 
complete sincerity, and LJB#1 is 
honestly offended.

And yet, Stephanie Garber is no 

dummy. She knows exactly what 
kind of book she’s writing and never 
shies away from the ridiculousness. 
Garber works entirely within 
familiar YA story structures, but 
she clearly understands exactly 
how 
to 
maximize 
traditional 

narratives to be their very best. 

Every 
character 

is well-developed, 
interesting, 
and 

complicated (except 
for Dante, but I 
mean, the dude’s 
name is Dante. It 
would be a little 
redundant 
if 
he 

had a personality). 
The relationships, 

though 
predictable, 
develop 

organically and believably. And the 
plot twists may be numerous, but 
they make sense and work within 
the 
larger 
story. 
Structurally, 

this book is precisely written 
and airtight in its construction, 
building in momentum by the page. 

“Caraval” has its flaws, and it may 

be silly, but it works. A functional, 
entertaining and effective story is 
no easy thing to write, especially 
within traditional YA frameworks 
from which people often expect 
the worst. It’s melodramatic and 
deeply entertaining. Ridiculous 
and glorious. All hail “Caraval.” 
Here to remind us just how weird 
and wonderful YA can be.

‘Crazy Ex’ teases change 

Season finale bodes of darker things to come for the show

There’s a moment in the 

“Crazy 
Ex-Girlfriend” 
finale 

where Rebecca (Rachel Bloom, 
“Fuck 
Me 
Ray 
Bradbury”) 

looks like she’s on the verge of a 
breakthrough. She’s sitting with 
her therapist and talking about 
how her father’s absence affected 
her relationships with the men in 
her life. It seems like she’s about 
to have a realization, but then she 
gets distracted and leaves in a rush. 
It’s one of a few false starts to her 
dealing with her mental issues. 
Now, whether Rebecca is ready to 
sort out her issues or not, the show 
looks like it’s ready to deal with 
them head-on. The brilliant season 
two finale of “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” 
gave us insight into Rebecca’s past, 
while the story had enough twists 
and turns to keep me on the edge 
of my seat, setting up a darker but 
fascinating third season.

The finale focuses on what 

happens around Rebecca and 
Josh Chan’s (Vincent Rodriguez 
III, “Hostages”) wedding. After a 
haphazard proposal and a rushed 
engagement 
period, 
Rebecca’s 

life is thrown further into chaos 
when her father, who left her when 
she was a teenager, returns. She 
spends most of the episode trying 
to restart the relationship while 
preparing for her wedding, which 
brings to light how her current 
issues connect with her father first 
leaving.

More than anything else, the 

show sets up a massive change in 
tone and theme for its third season. 
The main story arc for the first two 
seasons has been that of Rebecca 
and Josh. She moves across the 
country for him, she tries to win 
his love and she gets it. But now, 
he left her, and she’s pissed. This 
sets up a third season where the 
focus will be about 
her anger and her 
seeking 
revenge 

against Josh. The 
show hasn’t been 
afraid of hinting at 
the darker aspects 
of mental illness 
(see the first season song “You 
Stupid Bitch”). However, it hasn’t 
fully embraced it up to this point.

And, I hope with the embrace of 

a darker tone, the show will delve 
further into Rebecca’s mental 
illness. There were moments 
and hints throughout the season, 
but there was always something 
that prevented her from making 
a realization (in those moments, 
the show used the exacerbation of 
her therapist to comic effect). Still, 
the finale flashes back to moments 
from Rebecca’s past involving 
her relationship with a married 
professor at Harvard Law named 
Robert (Adam Kaufman, “State of 
Affairs”). As a result of her burning 
his clothes after he breaks up with 
her, she is forced by the court to 
spend time in a mental institution. 
There’s clearly more story to mine 
in both her background and her 
efforts to get treatment, and it 

looks like the show will bring more 
of that to light last year.

One of the key strengths of 

“Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” remains 
its music, as the second season 
featured some of the show’s best 
musical moments. In the finale 
itself, “Rebecca’s Reprise” is a 
medley of four songs that perfectly 
captures her journey up to that 

point. 
It’s 
the 

emotional 
climax 

for the season, as 
she seems to have 
everything 
she’d 

ever wanted. And, 
the 
music 
helps 

to emphasize the 

emotional moments. Right before 
everything starts to unravel for 
her, the song is a moment of bliss. 
The season was filled with many 
great musical moments. From 
Greg (Santino Fontana, “Shades of 
Blue”) leaving the show with one 
last reminder of how “It Was a Shit 
Show” to the hilarious numbers 
like “We Tapped that Ass” or 
“The Math of Love Triangles,” the 
series knows how to make fun and 
engaging musical moments.

The second season of “Crazy 

Ex-Girlfriend” wasn’t perfect, as 
the show seemed to struggle in the 
immediate aftermath of Fontana 
leaving. But the finale was about as 
good an ending as it could’ve had. 
It attacked its material with depth 
and intelligence, while setting up 
a third season that, while being 
remarkably different than prior 
years, will take the show in a 
fascinating direction.

Newcomers look to fit into veteran squad

Leading up to the 2017 season, 
the Michigan baseball team has 
been stressing two recurring 
themes — culture and experience. 
The program has now won 30 or 
more games in each of the last 
three seasons under coach Erik 
Bakich, improving its winning 
percentage each year. With a 
veteran core of 12 juniors and 
seven seniors returning, that 
mark appears attainable again. 
Now in his fifth season at 
the helm, Bakich has overseen 
the development of an entire 
recruiting class. He has watched 
his players progress through 
the program, receive interest 
from MLB teams, and seen some 
eventually be drafted. To Bakich, 
the five players chosen in the MLB 
Draft last year — the most the 
Wolverines have had since 2010 
— is emblematic of the culture his 
teams create.
“That’s the nature of the beast 
in quality programs, (you) try to 
build the best program you can,” 

Bakich said. “One of the impacts 
of that is that the players are 
going to develop and get drafted 
to professional baseball.”
Three 
of 
Michigan’s 
2016 
draftees — pitchers Brett Adcock 
and Evan Hill and utility player 
Carmen Benedetti — signed pro 
contracts last summer, leaving 
glaring holes to fill. While the 
Wolverines 
already 
have 
an 
abundance of upperclassmen ready 
to fill these roles, Bakich believes 
the 12 newcomers to the team 
have an equal chance to duplicate 
the 
success 
and 
year-by-year 
progression that Adcock, Hill and 
Benedetti made in their careers.
Of the Wolverines’ incoming 
class, 
the 
biggest 
immediate 
impact will likely be made by 
those who have already played 
baseball at the collegiate level 
– the five junior college and 
Division I transfers.
Redshirt sophomore outfielder 
Miles Lewis is perhaps the most 
high-profile among them. He 
was the 2016 Western Athletic 
Conference Freshman of the Year 
and a Freshman All-American 

at North Dakota, batting .360 
and stealing 20 bases. When the 
Fighting Hawks dropped their 
baseball program after the season, 
Lewis 
had 
the 
opportunity 
to transfer anywhere and be 
immediately eligible to play. With 
only two returning outfielders 
on the roster, the Wolverines 
will likely rely heavily on Lewis’s 
speed and switch-hitting ability 
right out of the gate.
“He brings that impact ability 
to come in and solidify an outfield 
role and hit close to the top of the 
order,” Bakich said.
Another player that Bakich 
named as having an opportunity 
to contribute immediately is 
sophomore Nick Poirier, who hit 
.372 with four home runs and 
31 runs batted in last season at 
San Joaquin Delta Community 
College. Poirier brings a left-
handed presence with a chance 
to add much-needed outfield 
depth, and may also see time at 
designated hitter.
On the mound, Bakich said that 
junior Alec Rennard, a transfer 
from Santa Rosa Junior College, 

is one of the Wolverines’ four best 
pitchers. At Santa Rosa, Rennard 
was the Big 8 Conference Pitcher 
of the Year and a first-team Junior 
College All-American, going 14-1 
with a 1.40 ERA, while walking 
just 10 batters in 115.2 innings.
“He’s got a winner’s mentality,” 
Bakich said. “He’ll be in our 
rotation somewhere.”
Michigan’s recruiting class also 
includes seven freshmen, three of 
whom were highlighted by Bakich 
as players to watch. Outfielder 
Christian 
Bullock 
brings 
athleticism and solid hitting 
potential, while pitchers Tommy 
Henry and Karl Kauffman have 
the talent to eventually comprise 
the backbone of the pitching staff.
“This is obviously a very skilled 
freshman class, and we have some 
talented (junior college transfers) 
that have proven themselves,” 
said junior infielder Jake Bivens. 
“They’ve been great additions 
to this team and have fit right in 
with this culture, so we’re excited 
to see them actually get on the 
field and play against other guys.”
Even though the potential is 
clearly there for the freshmen, 
the excitement may have to wait 
a little bit. With the veteran 
makeup of the lineup, it may 
be difficult for any of them to 
earn consistent playing time 
immediately. However, Bakich 
stresses that they will still have 
opportunities to play key roles.
“They’re trying to get a feel 
for the academics and the speed 
of the game while still having a 
social life and making friends,” 
Bakich said. “It’s going to be very 
challenging for them to get on 
the field and have an impact-type 
role, but I think you’ll see them 
contribute in ways where they can 
help the team in certain spots.”
The junior college transfers 
have the experience and ability 
to step in right away and fill key 
holes vacated from last season, 
supplementing 
an 
already 
veteran team. In the meantime, 
a promising group of freshmen 
lies waiting for their opportunity. 
After 
years 
of 
consistent 
improvement, 
the 
Wolverines 
appear to have a solid foundation 
in place, both now and in the 
future.

Michigan edges Purdue

The No. 21 Michigan women’s 
basketball 
team 
traveled 
to 
Purdue on Wednesday night, 
looking to reach their 20th win 
in the shortest amount of time in 
program 
history. 
Despite a 
slow start 
to the contest, Michigan eked out a 
72-62 win over the Boilermakers. 
The Wolverines missed their 
first three shots in the first 
minute alone, and their struggles 
continued throughout the frame. 
Even though it led at 22-18 at the 
end of the first quarter, Michigan’s 
scoring 
difficulty 
was 
still 
apparent. The Wolverines missed 
more than half of their shots from 
the floor, and their leading scorer, 
junior guard Katelynn Flaherty, 
was 0-7 from the field.
Freshman 
guard 
Kysre 
Gondrezick 
though, 
was 
unfazed by the inaccuracy of her 
teammates. She put Michigan 
on the board with a 3-pointer 
and continued to carry the 
team 
offensively, 
ending 
the 
first quarter with seven points. 
Sophomore center Hallie Thome 
was right behind her with six 
points.
The 
second 
quarter 
went 
slightly 
smoother 
for 
the 
Wolverines. Flaherty tallied seven 
points while sophomore guard 
Nicole Munger — who scored 
the game-winning layup against 
Iowa — earned her first points 
of the game with a big 3-pointer, 
coming off the bench to rouse her 
sluggish teammates. By halftime, 
the game was anything but 
decided. Michigan led by eight 
points, but had committed 10 
costly turnovers that Purdue had 
capitalized on.
“I thought we got better with 
(turnovers) as the game went on,” 
said Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico. “At halftime, we were really 
concerned. We had 10 of them and 
a lot of them were touchdowns, 
they were layups. And that was 
really scary.”
Despite their mistakes, the 
Wolverines found a way to stay 
ahead, never relinquishing their 

lead. Yet, Purdue was constantly 
at Michigan’s heels, narrowing 
the Wolverines’ lead to only one 
point late in the third quarter.
Even though the Wolverines 
were not comfortably ahead, 
Flaherty — who ended the 
game with 13 points on 5-for-19 
shooting — took just four shots 
in the second half. Instead, she 
increased her passing, ending 
the matchup with five assists — 
surpassing even senior guard 
Siera Thompson, who is ranked 
third in the conference in assists.
“(Flaherty) led our team in 
assists tonight, which was was 
great to see,” Barnes Arico said. 
“Sometimes 
you’re 
going 
to 
have an off night. … If you’re not 
making shots, somebody on our 
team probably is.”
Gondrezick was that player. 
The rookie – who earned her fifth 
Big Ten Freshman of the Week 
award Monday — scored 14 points 
in the fourth quarter for a total of 
25, setting her career-high.
“She took over the game,” 
Barnes Arico said. “We got 
stagnant a little bit. We couldn’t 
figure out a way to score. And 
Kysre figured that out for us.
“She’s been the player that 
continues to improve in each and 
every contest.”
While Gondrezick led the team 
in scoring, Thome did her part 
as well, tallying 15 points, eight 
rebounds and four assists.
Junior forward Jillian Dunston 
held steady on defense, tying her 
career high for rebounds with 15. 
The Boilermakers had almost the 
exact same field-goal percentage 
as Michigan — 42.2 and 42.3, 
respectively. Without her crucial 
defense, the Wolverines’ lead 
could have easily been surpassed.
Thompson also played a large 
role on defense, never stepping off 
the court in 40 minutes of play.
“What she does for our team 
doesn’t always show up in the 
box score,” Barnes Arico said. 
“The goal that she had for today 
was to hold (senior guard Ashley 
Morissette) under 10 (points). 
She’s an awesome defender.”
Against Purdue on Wednesday, 
Michigan — ranked for the first 
time since 2013 — proved that it 
wants to stay.

taken place nearly three years 
ago, but Jack LaFontaine still 
remembers it vividly. 
During his sophomore year of 
high school, the now-freshman 
goaltender 
for 
the 
Michigan 
hockey team was in Ann Arbor to 
watch the Wolverines take on Penn 
State. LaFontaine, still a relatively 
unheralded prospect in search of 
an offer, met with the coaching 
staff for the first time after the 
game.
LaFontaine 
smiled 
while 
recalling that talk with Michigan 
coach Red Berenson. Clearly, it still 
holds weight with him — a marker 
of his past and the path he took.
“I finally introduced myself to 
coach 
(Berenson),” 
LaFontaine 
said. “I remember him saying, ‘Go 
develop, do your thing and come 
talk to me in a couple years.’ ”
Sure enough, two years later, 
LaFontaine found himself back in 
Ann Arbor, albeit under different 
circumstances. This time, he was 
a highly-coveted prospect in the 
midst of a stint with the United 
States Hockey League’s Janesville 
Jets, projected to be taken in 
the NHL Draft later that spring. 
And this time, when he met with 
Berenson, the coach offered him a 
scholarship.
After the visit, LaFontaine went 
home to Canada, discussed it with 
his family and then called both 
Berenson and assistant coach Brian 
Wiseman to let them know he was 
committing to Michigan. He didn’t 
officially commit until nearly a 
week after his visit, but LaFontaine 
had laid in bed the previous Friday 
— the night he arrived in Ann 
Arbor — with an inkling that he 
wanted to be a Wolverine.
While the natural progression 
from unofficial visit to official visit 
to commitment may have once 
been common practice, the pace 
of recruiting in college hockey has 
quickened so much that stories like 
LaFontaine’s are now unique.

***
That phenomenon has taken 
place in most collegiate sports. It 
was once standard for athletes to 
commit to a school during their 
senior year, but now top recruits 
are committing to schools earlier 
and earlier. Freshman forward 
Will Lockwood committed in the 
spring of 2014 as a sophomore 
in high school. Jacob Truscott, 
a 14-year-old defenseman in the 
2020-21 class, committed this past 
Saturday.
As Berenson says, it’s an “ever-
changing process,” and it has 
caused a shift to the types of visits 
that players take.
LaFontaine’s 
interest 
in 
Michigan was initially piqued by 
his first trip to Ann Arbor — dubbed 
an “unofficial visit” by the NCAA.
Recruits can take unofficial 
visits to schools whenever they 
want. The only caveat is that the 
athlete and his family must pay 
their own way. The school, as 
bound by NCAA rules, cannot 
pay for their travel or lodging, 
among other expenses. Most of the 
work Michigan has to do involves 
contacting the ticket office to 
let them know which games the 
recruit will be visiting for, or the 
coaches setting aside time to meet 
with the player and his family.
Schools, however, can pay for a 
recruit’s official visit, but recruits 
must wait until at least their senior 
year to take one.
This is where the acceleration 
of the recruiting process comes 
into play: with players choosing 
to commit earlier in the process, 
schools can no longer afford to 
bring them in only on official visits. 
In Michigan’s case, the assistant 
coaches — and Berenson, to a lesser 
extent — are constantly involved 
with setting up unofficial visits, 
either during the season or the 
offseason.
“The official visit is important,” 
Berenson said. “But the unofficial 
visit might be the most important, 
where they come early and realize, 
‘Oh, this is where I want to go.’ 
They might get blown away the 

first time they come here.”
Luckily for the Wolverines, 
they 
already 
have 
a 
built-in 
advantage compared to teams like 
Arizona State or Penn State: their 
geography.
Michigan is typically a hotbed 

for hockey, and the United States 
National 
Team 
Development 
Program practices just 30 minutes 
away from Ann Arbor. The city 
is also within driving distance 
of much of Canada. The more 
manageable 
the 
distance, 
the 
easier it is for recruits to take 
unofficial visits to Michigan early 
in the process, before they leave 
their hometowns to finish their 
prep careers in junior leagues like 
the USHL.
While the Wolverines have 
extended their reach nationally 
as the sport has grown in the 
past few decades, the team is still 
mostly comprised of players from 
the surrounding region. Of the 28 
players on the roster, 13 are from 
Michigan and six are from the 
Midwest or Canada.
Despite the growing importance 
of unofficial visits, official visits 
still serve a valuable purpose. 
They can solidify the status 
of a recruit wavering on his 
verbal commitment, grow the 
relationship between a player and 
his future coaches and teammates, 
or allow players to compare 
different schools.
And perhaps most importantly 
for 
Michigan, 
a 
school 
that 
deals with early or unexpected 
departures nearly every offseason, 
official visits allow the coaching 
staff to showcase the school late in 
the recruiting process to recruits 
who haven’t committed yet at 
all, like LaFontaine, or who are 
reconsidering their initial decision. 
The script for an official visit to 
Ann Arbor is usually the same 
for most recruits, according to 
Berenson. The recruits will arrive 
in the evening, eat dinner with a 
current team member assigned as 
their host and spend time with the 
host and the rest of the team. The 
recruit will also tour the campus 

and meet with academic officials 
before visiting the hockey facilities 
and spending time with the 
coaches. In most cases, the recruit 
will also attend practice and a 
game, before the trip concludes 
with a meeting in Berenson’s office.
Yet, while most official visit 
itineraries 
are 
similar, 
what 
resonates the most with each 
individual recruit is often different. 
For Slaker, it was how the coaching 
staff watched film with him.
“They videotape every practice 
and they’ll break it down and look 
at what guys need to work on,” 
Slaker said. “There’s always extra 
ice in the morning for guys to work 
on depending on classes. They 
were showing me videos of guys 
working on stuff in the mornings 
and incorporating it into games. 
After talking to the coaching staff 
and seeing everything that they do 
and how professional it is, I thought 
it was the best opportunity to give 
me a shot to play pro hockey.”
His visit to Michigan only 
confirmed what he had already 
been feeling, and he didn’t take 
much time in making his second 
commitment — telling Berenson he 
wanted to be a Wolverine.
While 
Slaker 
enjoyed 
the 
technical breakdown of his future 
at Michigan, LaFontaine was most 
enamored with the family feel he 
got from Michigan.
***
By 
now, 
Berenson 
has 
delegated most of the recruiting 
responsibilities 
to 
other 
staff 
members like associate head coach 
Billy Powers and Wiseman. It 
was Wiseman who served as the 
primary contact for both Slaker 
and LaFontaine before each took 
their official visit to Michigan.
Perhaps that is by design. 
Berenson 
has 
a 
legendary 
reputation within the sport, and 
at this point, he has been a coach 
for long before any recruit was 
born. So when a recruit steps into 
Berenson’s office, having had little 
prior contact and not knowing what 
to expect, something as simple as 
a short face-to-face conversation 

can still have the most meaningful 
impact.
“It was surreal,” Slaker said. 
“His history speaks for itself. It was 
kinda shocking just to get to shake 
his hand. I felt really honored to 
have an opportunity to play here. 
It was really cool meeting him 
and getting to talk to him a bit and 
see where he saw me in the lineup 
and where he thought I could be 
as a player. It got me really excited 
about coming here.”
Added 
LaFontaine: 
“... 
I 
remember sitting down at practice, 
and coach (Berenson) just telling 
me all these great stories. Not even 
Michigan-related, just about his 
time as a professional hockey player 
and his time as a coach. It was by far 
the most unique visit I’ve had.”
It’s in those final meetings 
where Berenson gets to state his 
final case on unofficial or official 
visits, and he has secured many a 
commitment doing so.
“We had one kid — his name was 
Luke Moffatt,” Berenson said. “I 
told him, ‘We’re not going to rush 

you. You take your time and decide 
and let us know what you want to 
do.’ And right away, he ripped off 
his overshirt and he had a Michigan 
hockey shirt underneath, and he 
said, ‘That’s my answer.’ That was 
one of the more memorable ones.”
At this point, there isn’t much 
complexity to Berenson’s pitch. As 
a visit comes to an end, the recruit 
and school have become familiar 
with each other. By the time they 
met with Berenson, Slaker and 
LaFontaine knew what type of 
opportunities a Michigan offer 
presented, and so he didn’t have to 
sell the program very hard.
“We’re 
very 
transparent,” 
Berenson said. “They can ask any 
questions. We lay it all out, and this 
is Michigan. It’s pretty hard not to 
like it. If you’re looking for a good 
school and a good program, that’s 
what we offer. I would say that goes 
for all our sports here. You get the 
best of both worlds.”

Betsa chases perfection in circle

For a steadfast endurer like 
Megan Betsa, stopping is the 
most difficult aspect of striving 
for perfection.
But that’s what the senior 
pitcher — who was described as 
the epitome of a perfectionist 
by 
Michigan 
coach 
Carol 
Hutchins — was forced to do 
this fall while healing nagging 
injuries.
Following 
a 
dominant 
season en route to a College 
World 
Series 
Championship 
appearance in 2015, the two-
time Big Ten Pitcher of the 
Year felt the lingering effects of 
repeated use in high-pressure 
situations 
the 
next 
spring, 
sitting out during parts of the 
preseason.
So instead of throwing in 
the bullpen, playing catch and 
running out to the rubber during 
fall exhibitions, she was forced 
to watch from the dugout and 
attempt to achieve perfection 
on the trainer’s table and in the 
weight room.
“… She was convinced she was 
behind (last spring),” Hutchins 
said. “And if you think you’re 
behind, you’re behind. If you 
think you’re tired, you’re tired. 
We needed her to be ready for 
this part of the year — that’s 
the only way we could almost 
guarantee it.”
During her recovery period, 
Betsa changed her approach to 
challenging hitters and focused 
on throwing strikes — something 
she struggled with in 2016, 
when she walked 113 batters. 
While Betsa’s pure ability has 
allowed her to escape numerous 
jams caused by control issues, 
the senior has concluded that 
allowing contact will allow for 
more efficient pitching.
“I definitely want to modify 
the amount of pitches that I 
throw,” Betsa said. “My goal is 
always to get ahead of the hitter, 
and I’m learning now that it’s 
okay to let my defense work for 
me. I have to attack every hitter 
from the very first pitch. I know 
that my defense has my back 
and that’s what I have to trust. 
I trust myself and I trust them.”

Still, control continues to 
be a rare weakness for the 
right-hander in the eyes of 
Hutchins, who credits offseason 
conditioning to Betsa’s pitches 
breaking sharper than before 
— even to the point that 
her 
command 
has 
become 
inconsistent.
“I think she’s pitching better 
than ever,” Hutchins said. “Her 
spin’s tighter, her fitness is very 
good, she’s strong because she 
had to work her back and core 
muscles. Her command of the 
zone is still not as good as it 
would normally be at this point, 
and partly because her ball is 
breaking more.”
Betsa’s 
presence 
will 
be 
stressed in 2017. She’s the only 
established pitcher returning 
to the rotation following the 
graduation of Sara Driesenga, 
who went 22-1 with a 2.13 
earned-run 
average 
for 
the 
Wolverines last season.
Replacing 
the 
131-plus 
innings 
of 
work 
Driesenga 
brought to the rotation has 
been a puzzle that Hutchins has 
attempted to solve all offseason 
by giving junior Tera Blanco 
and sophomore Leah Crockett 
opportunities 
in 
bullpen 
sessions and fall scrimmages.
Blanco has started just five 
games in her career despite 
being recruited to Michigan as 
a highly-touted pitcher. Instead, 
she’s been most valuable inside 
the batter’s box, hitting .404 
with 13 home runs and 66 runs 
batted in as the starting first 
baseman in 2016.
As Blanco proves to be one 
of the most offensively potent 
Wolverines returning to the 
lineup — Hutchins mentioned 
she’d most likely hit in the 
four or five spot this season — 
conventional knowledge points 
to the possible production drop-
off that could come with an 
added pitching responsibility. 
But Hutchins doesn’t believe 
Blanco is a conventional softball 
player. 
“I don’t think (pitching and 
the loss of offensive production) 
has 
to 
go 
hand-in-hand,” 
Hutchins said. “She spent most 
of the preseason pitching, but 
she was first-team All-American 

because of her bat. She actually 
makes the case for ‘Why do we 
hit so much?’ because she didn’t 
hit as much as the rest of these 
guys. Tera’s definitely a gamer.”
Crockett, meanwhile, pitched 
to just four batters in only 
one game last season — the 
final inning of a 9-1 February 
blowout against Virginia Tech. 
As expected with an untested 
player, Crockett will have to 
show that she’s deserving of 
pitching meaningful innings.
“… Leah Crockett has to earn 
a spot,” Hutchins said. “She 
has to show us when she gets 
her opportunity, that she can 
be the one. She’s going to get 
an opportunity and she’s got to 
command the zone and be able 
mix up speeds. That’s all she has 
to do.”
While Betsa is the seasoned 
ace 
that 
can 
carry 
the 
Wolverines through a pivotal 
game 
or 
postseason 
series, 
her time away from pitching 
actually gave the rest of the 
Michigan pitching staff the 
repetition it needed.
“I really think Megan Betsa 
sitting out in the fall really put 
the weight of the world on Tera 
and Leah,” Hutchins said. “It 
gave them really meaningful 
experience. Both of them grew 
a lot because you grow a lot by 
getting thrown into the fire. So, 
the fall was critical.”
And Betsa didn’t forget about 
Blanco 
and 
Crockett 
while 
working on her own health and 
strength, either.
“During 
the 
fall, 
I 
was 
watching them pitch,” Betsa 
said. “I think one of my strengths 
is being able to control my 
thoughts and the mental side of 
my game. So, if there’s anything 
that I’ve been able to help the 
other pitchers with, I think it’s 
that. Everything that I do, I’m 
doing for the girls around me. 
I’m doing it for the person to my 
left and the person to my right. 
I try to be as selfless as I can 
when it comes to that stuff.”
Perfection isn’t necessarily 
what Michigan seeks. But with 
Betsa’s 
perfectionist 
spirit 
affecting both her own and 
others’ pitching, the Wolverines 
can move closer to it this season.

Embracing “junkyard dog” mentality, Simpson emerges for Michigan

In the locker room before 
Tuesday’s contest against Michigan 
State, John Beilein posted a picture 
of a dog on the board where he does 
his pregame talks.
He wanted his team to look 
into the eyes of the image of the 
“junkyard dog” to understand 
the anger and the desperation the 
canine had.
It wasn’t meant to be a cute 
pregame talk. The Michigan coach 
had been trying to get his team to 
play with that sort of attitude for 
weeks.
Perhaps all it took was a visual 
aid.
Beilein’s team finally responded, 
bullying the Spartans all night and 
making plays that revolved around 
the toughness idealized by the dog.
“Today was perfect,” Beilein said. 
“They were there. They were angry. 
They were like junkyard dogs. That 
was the whole idea. We had to go 
out there angry and play with that 
edge we so desperately need.”
One of the more surprising 
players who took the night’s motto 
to heart was Xavier Simpson. The 
freshman guard was averaging 
just eight minutes per game and 
had scored just nine total points in 
conference play entering Tuesday.
With senior guard Derrick 
Walton Jr. carrying Michigan 
through the most recent stretch of 
games, Beilein knew he had to find 
a more effective way for Simpson to 
get involved and make an impact to 
take the load off of Walton.
Simpson’s 
struggles 
in 
Big 
Ten play have revolved heavily 
around not being comfortable with 
the increased pace. Though the 
freshman once scored 65 points in 
a high school game, he hasn’t yet 
seemed comfortable putting it all 
together at the collegiate level.
Beilein 
has 
primarily 
used 
Simpson 
in 
tight 
defensive 
situations in recent games, subbing 
him in for Walton or junior guard 

Muhammad-Ali Abdur-Rahkman 
when the Wolverines need stops on 
defense.
But 
assistant 
coach 
Saddi 
Washington, who has worked 
closely with Simpson, approached 
Beilein this week and proposed 
tweaking 
the 
freshman’s 
gameplan.
“Saddi 
Washington’s 
been 
doing a great job and he really 
suggested that he played more 
today,” Beilein said. “He also 
simplified (Simpson’s) package. He 
understands everything we do, but 
the timing of it is still just a little bit 
off.”
Washington’s 
adjustment, 
paired with Beilein’s pregame 
message, created the perfect storm 
for Simpson to have the breakout 
game he had been seeking all 
season.

In his 12 minutes of play, 
Simpson was a menace to Michigan 
State guards on both ends of the 
court.
Defensively, 
he 
built 
upon 
his recent solid 
performances 
by 
being 
more 
aggressive 
and 
taking advantage 
of the Spartans’ 
inability to protect 
the ball. Simpson 
didn’t record any 
steals, but much 
of the night, he 
was either putting 
his teammates in 
positions to make them or forcing 
Michigan State players to turn the 
ball over.
It was on the offensive end 
where Simpson really showed 

signs of growth. The freshman, 
who was shooting just 24 percent 
from the field before Tuesday’s 
contest, went 3-for-4 from the 
field while also dishing out two 
assists. The six-
foot guard showed 
a new willingness 
to drive to the 
hoop and absorb 
whatever contact 
met him near the 
basket.
“I’m a (more) 
complete 
player 
than 
I 
was 
a 
month ago and 
a 
week 
ago,” 
Simpson said. “So the coaches are 
teaching me and I’m embracing the 
challenge. Obviously, it was hard at 
first, but I just have to stick with it 
and trust the process.”

After Simpson drained his lone 
3-point attempt, Michigan State 
called a timeout and Michigan’s 
bench exploded, mobbing him 
when he reached the Wolverine 
sideline.
But no other Michigan player 
will welcome Simpson’s emergence 
as much as Walton. 
Despite playing the best stretch 
of basketball of his career, Walton 
still needs help from his fellow 
guards to help him lead the offense 
or fill in when he needs a rest.
“I knew for a fact, down the 
road (Simpson would break out),” 
Walton said. “He’s a really tough 
kid and he always sticks to it. 
Nights like this don’t surprise me. 
I’m really excited for him and I’m 
hoping he can build on it.”
Walton 
himself 
has 
been 
part of the problem as to why 

Simpson hasn’t had this type of 
performance, simply because it has 
been impossible for Beilein to sub 
out the senior during his recent 
run.
But Simpson is in no way 
deterred by staying on the bench 
and watching his mentor perform 
like he has.
“Derrick (has been) playing 
tremendous the last few games,” 
Simpson said. “I can’t be on the 
bench and wish he got more fouls 
or wish a negative impact on him. 
He’s been playing great.
“When a guy like that is doing 
his job and getting us wins, you 
have to do what you have to do.”
Walton and Simpson did spend 
some time on the court together 
Tuesday, 
with 
the 
freshman 
playing the point and the senior 
at the ‘2.’ Beilein was able to 
use that combination, and one 
in which Walton, Simpson and 
Abdur-Rahkman were all on the 
court together. Beilein will hope 
Simpson’s form carries over into 
the future so he can use these 
lineups again in order to give the 
Wolverines a different look.
“He actually surprised me with 
the three-guard lineup,” Simpson 
said. “I knew we could do it. We’re 
all pretty aggressive and at the time 
that’s what (Beilein) wanted, so 
that’s what we did. I felt like it was 
great for the team.”
Simpson’s emergence has been 
a long time coming, and it couldn’t 
have come at a better time for 
Michigan. His “junkyard dog” 
mentality and the simplified game 
can give the Wolverines the boost 
off the bench they’ve been looking 
for to power them through the 
upcoming stretch of the Big Ten 
schedule.
“It feels great,” Simpson said. 
“Not just for me, it takes pressure 
off Derrick. It takes pressure off 
other players also. For me to come 
in and give that extra boost I felt 
like I not only helped myself, but 
also, most importantly, helped the 
team.”
