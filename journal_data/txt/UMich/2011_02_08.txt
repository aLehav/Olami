an Diane
Brown said
Kelley, who KELLEY
went by Mat-

lapsed shortly after dismissing
a class of graduate students at
about 2:35 p.m. yesterday.
Medical officials attempted
to resuscitate Kelley, age 41, for
30 to 45 minutes, according to
Brown. Kelley was pronounced
dead at 3:15 p.m.
Brown said the cause of death
is currently unknown.
University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald said he did not know

anymore information asof 8 p.m.
last night.
A Business School sophomore
who wished to remain annony-
mous said he had Kelley as an
instructor in the Lloyd Hall
Scholars Program.
"Matt Kelly was a great pro-
fessor. He was always under-
standing, and if circumstances
came up, he'd never get mad at
anyone," the student said. "And
he really had a passion for the
stuff that he taught. I had him for
photo book class in LHSP, and he
would (spend) his own money;
he'd get from grants and stuff
in order to make the class more
interesting."
The student continued, "He
was truly someone that was
incredible, and definitely some-
one valuable to this University
and probably one of my favorite
teachers."
LSA junior Sarah Friedman
who was taught by Kelley her
freshman year said Kelley great-

"Everyone I knew spoke very

Ann Arbor City Council members discuss a proposed medical marijuana ordinance at last night's meeting. The ordinance was not voted on last night but willIb

marijisuana ordinance

Council votes on
amendments to pot
legislation
By SUZANNE JACOBS
Daily Staff Reporter
The Ann Arbor City Council
continued its long and complex
process of attempting to estab-
lish local medical marijuana leg-
islation at its meeting last night.

The latest version of the city's
proposed medical marijuana
ordinance went before City
Council for a second first read-
ing yesterday. If passed, the
ordinance would abolish the
city's temporary moratorium
on medical marijuana dispen-
saries that was put in place last
August.
The ordinance originally
underwent a first reading at a
City Council meeting on Jan. 3.
At its next meeting, which will

be Feb. 21, the council should
do a second reading on the ordi-
nance and vote on it.
With little or no guidance
from state law on how to regu-
late medical marijuana dispen-
saries, cultivation facilities and
home occupations, municipali-
ties in various Michigan cities
have struggled to create legis-
lation dealing with the topic,
especially since the legislation
involves federally illegal activ-
ity.

During the public commen-
tary at the beginning of the City
Council meeting, medical mari-
juana advocate Rhory Gould
talked about his frustration
with the city's current moratori-
um since it has now lasted more
than 180 days but was supposed
to last 120 days. Gould said City
Councilhas spent too much time
working on the ordinance.
Ann Arbor Mayor John Hief-
tje said it is necessary to outline

University students and fac-
ulty may have been surprised

when they didn't see the typical
University gateway website on
their computer screens last Fri-
day night.
The website, umich.edu,
underwent an aesthetic lift last
week, something that the Univer-
sity's Marketing and Design team
had been working on since last
fall, according to David Lampe,
the University's vice president for

communications.
A thorough redesign of the
website - which had remained
unchanged since 2006 - is pro-
jected to be completed by January
2012, Lampe said.
"This is not a redesign, but a
quick refresh," he said. "If you
notice, the content and the struc-
ture is largely the same."

With the large amount of snow-
fall burying Ann Arbor recently,
employees of the University Ground
Services have been busy.
Throughout the winter months,
several University departments are
involved in snow and ice removal
on campus. The Grounds & Waste
Management Services is the leading
University department that coor-
dinates efforts with the Universi-
ty's Parking & Transportation and
Building Services in removing the
snow from sidewalks, stairs, build-
ing entrances and bus stops around
campus.
According to the GWM Services
2010 manual, the department's goal
is to plow University roads and side-
walls within 24 hours after a snow-
storm. The manual also states that

ground services make the areas sur-
rounding handicap accessible build-
ings their primary concern for snow
removal.
GWM Services has decreased its
use of salt and sand in University
parking lots and on sidewalks an
average of 43 percent from last win-
ter by incorporating 17 alternative
melting applications when weather
forecasts expect a 50 percent prob-
ability of precipitation in the winter,
according to the manual.
Students may also notice roped-
off sections of outdoor steps of
University buildings in the winter.
GWM Services does this to reduce
the amount of de-icing materials
used at building entrances and to
minimize the damage to facilities
and the environment, the manual

states.
The GWM manual explains that
the department makes provisions for
anti-icing materials, rates of applica-
tion andspecific areas of application,
depending on the temperature and
the level of snow accumulation. The
protocol also states that intersec-
tions and hills are priority areas for
maintenance during snowfall.
However, snow removal on city
streets that students frequent,
including North University Avenue,
South University Avenue and State
Street, are the city of Ann Arbor's
responsibility. Any sidewalks in
front of non-University, buildings
like students' homes, are under pri-
vate jurisdiction regarding snowA HNNAH CHIN/

LEFTERIS PITARAKIS/AP
An Egyptian anti-government protester is seen in Tahrir Square, the center of anti-government demonstrations, in Cairo,
Egypt, yesterday. The writing on his forehead refers to Egypt President Hosni Mubarak.
Despite conesos gpt
r e score stands firm

Tens of thousands of
protesters continue
to call for Mubarak's
resignation
CAIRO (AP) - Egypt's
regime has offered a string of
concessions in the face of the
strongest threat yet to its rule,
but so far nothing that uproots
its entrenched monopoly on
power.
The power elite has ruled for
six decades, backed by a consti-
tution it wrote, state media it
controls and millions of Egyp-
tians who depend on its patron-
age. In the face of a popular
uprising, it has shown dogged
resilience in what opponents say
is a campaign to break anti-gov-
ernment protests and preserve
the regime's authority after
President Hosni Mubarak leaves
the stage.
In an example of the levers
it can pull, the government
announced a 15 percent raise
yesterday for some 6 million
public employees - a potent
message to almost a quarter of
Egypt's labor force about where
their loyalties should lie.
Leading the effort is Vice
President Omar Suleiman, a
canny former intelligence chief
with vast experience in inter-

national negotiations, who has
promised to carry out change.
However, after talks with
Suleiman on Sunday, many pro-
testers and their allies warned
the steps toward democratic
reform he is offering look more
like an effort to divide and con-
quer the opposition by offering
cosmetic gestures.
Zakariya Abdel-Aziz, a
judge who backs the protesters,
described the government's con-
cessions as "smoke in the air."
"The only thing the regime
does is to turn people against
each other. This is the scenar-
in, and the goal is to win more
time," he said.
The tens of thousands gath-
ering daily in Cairo's Tahrir
Square say they will settle for
nothing less than Mubarak's
ouster and a breaking of the
regime's hold. They insist
each government retreat fuels
momentum toward that goal.
But they're well aware the
regime is digging in.
"Now we are at the nail-biting
stage," said Wael Abdel-Fattah,
a pro-reform columnist. "The
regime is also pulling out the big
guns, using psychological war-
fare, terrorizing (protesters),
isolating them from society and
spreading the idea of Mubarak
as a father" figure to convince
the broader public he must stay
on to guide the transition.

The government's concessions
so far would have been unimagi-
nable only three weeks ago.
The 82-year-old Mubarak
announced he will not run for
a new term in September elec-
tions, and Suleiman promised
that Mubarak's son Gamal
would not try to succeed him.
An unpopular interior minister
in charge of police was removed,
and the top leadership ofthe rul-
ing National Democratic Party
was replaced, though Mubarak
remains its official head.
Suleiman says any proposals
for reform are open for discus-
sion and he has even agreed to
talk to the outlawed Muslim
Brotherhood, long shunned by
Mubarak's government as its
most bitter rival.
But in concrete terms, those
steps merely amount to achange
in faces.
Deeper reform would mean
tackling the pillars of the pow-
erful coalition that has ruled
Egypt for decades - the ruling
party, the military and com-
manders of the powerful inter-
nal security forces.
Their strength has multiple
foundations. Emergency laws
in place since Mubarak came to
power nearly three decades ago
give police almost unlimited
powers of arrest, and they are
accused of using torture against
opponents with impunity.

DETROIT
City to renovate
abandoned homes
for police officers
Mayor Dave Bing is offering
renovated homes in Detroit for
as little as $1,000 to city police
officers who live in the suburbs
under a plan aimed at improving
neighborhoods and safety.
The city will tap federal stim-
ulus funds to repair up to 200
abandoned houses in the Bos-
ton-Edison and Indian Village
neighborhoods, Bing said during
a news conference yesterday.
At least 53 percent of the
city's 3,000 officers live outside
the city, Bing said. Residency
requirements for city employees
were wiped away by state law-
makers in 1999.
* Bing said the police presence
will hinder crime and create bet-
ter relationships with residents.
Detroit's population has dropped
by half after peaking at near 2
million in the early 1950s.
"Detroiters want to live in
safe, stable neighborhoods and
they deserve no less," Bing said.

74-year-old guilty
of selling national

A former research scientist
has been convicted of charges
he stole trade secrets from Dow
Chemical Company and sold
them to companies in China.
A federal jury in Baton Rouge
yesterday convicted 74-year-
old Wen Chyu Liu, also known
as David Liou, of conspiracy to
commit trade secret theft and
perjury.
Liu worked at Dow's
Plaquemine facility before he
retired in 1992. Prosecutors said
he conspired with other employ-
ees to sell confidential infor-
mation about the company's
production of a polymer called
chlorinated polyethylene, which
is used in automotive hoses,
vinyl siding and other products.

Wikileaks secrets
to be revealed in
insider's book
WikiLeaks is about to be out-
leaked. The former spokesman
of the secret spilling website,
who left the group after a famous
falling out with founder Julian
Assange, is about to publish
what's billed as a tell-all book
about its inner workings.
Daniel Domscheit-Berg, a
cryptic computer scientist, was
WikiLeaks' best-known face
after Assange himself. Perhaps
in true WikiLeaks style, his
insider account is being pub-
lished later this week simultane-
ously in 16 countries.
Publishers around the world
have promised that Domscheit-
Berg's "Inside WikiLeaks: My

site" will "tell the full story" and

about the group's operations.

specific details of the ordinance
before it goes before the council
for a first read. After an hour
of discussing the ordinance,
the meeting's public attendees
began to leave.
Twenty minutes later when
the council moved to postpone
discussion on the ordinance,
a visibly frustrated Hieftje
requested that the next time the
ordinance appear before coun-
cil it be in a "more appropriate"
and finalized form than it was
last nighf.
"It would be very helpful to
have it days in advance," he said,
looking toward City Attorney
Stephen Postema.
City Council member Sabra
Briere (D-Ward 1) led a lengthy
discussion outlining the pro-
posed amendments to the ordi-
nance. She first moved to clarify
the definitions for "cultivation
facilities" and "authorized per-
son," which were approved by
the council.
She also suggested that a
combined dispensary and cul-
tivation facility only require
one license as opposed to two,
comparing it to a brewpub that
brews and sells its own beer but
only requires a single license.
The council also approved this
motion.
Additionally, the council
voted not to require physicians
affiliated with dispensaries or
cultivation facilities to be listed
on the facilities' licenses.
During the public commen-
tary portion of the meeting,

speakers expressed concerns
that were less detail oriented
and more focused on the big pic-
ture.
One speaker, Ann Arbor
lawyer and medical marijuana
activist Dennis Hayes, listed
a number of concerns he had
with the current draft of the
ordinance, including a lack of
flexibility in cultivation facility
license transferability.
Another criticism Hayes had

was that the ordinance doesn't
mention the 2004 amendment
to the city charter that allows
the growing and use of marijua-
na for medicinal purposes.
Ream also expressed concern
for the safety of patients and
caregivers. Demanding that dis-
pensaries list all caregivers who
provide medical marijuana to
their facilities is an unnecessary
regulation, he said, that will
"drive out the little guy."
It's dangerous, Ream said, to
have a list of names for "crimi-
nals and junkies" to see.
Hieftje ended the council's
discussion of the ordinance by
referring back to Ream's com-
ments about safety for people in
the medical marijuana industry.
Hieftje said he hopes the new
ordinance will make it easy to
shut down facilities that attract
criminal activity.
Offering a different perspec-
tive, Tony Keene, owner and
manager of a local store - that
he said provides everything a
medical marijuana caregiver
would need - told the council

members they should do away
with dispensaries all together.
"Yes to medical marijuana,
no to dispensaries," Keene said.
"It's time to look at these dis-
pensaries and shut them down
because they're giving a bad
name to medical marijuana."
In a passionate address to
City Council, Keene said the
patient and caregiver relation-
ship is intact without dispensa-
ries, and he personally chooses
not to opena dispensary despite
its profitability as "a million-
dollar business in this town."
Keene also criticized the
council members for only
speaking with dispensary own-
ers and others involved in the
industry instead of getting input
from the public.
Longtime Ann Arbor resident
Ethel Potts, a regular attendee
at City Council meetings, said
in an interview after last night's
meetingthat she supports medi-
cal marijuana but doesn't feel
comfortable commenting on
dispensaries because she knows
little about them.
She did say, however, that
she disagrees with the way City
Council has dealt with the ordi-
nance, criticizing the lengthy
and detailed discussions that
have taken place during meet-
ings. The intricate details, she
said, should be dealt with in
committee meetings.
"It's too important to do it
this way," she said. "I think they
could do a better job in private ...
and then explain themselves in
public."

WEBSITE
From Page 1
The website's new look com-
bines the directory and site search
functions into one, which Lampe
said is going to be made even bet-
ter in the redesign.
Also among the alterations
already made to the website are
the widening of the homepage
and larger links and photographs
on the main site, Lampe said.
University President Mary
Sue Coleman said at yesterday's
Senate Advisory Committee on
University Affairs meeting that
she thinks the new layout will be
helpful for users navigating the
website.
"This is a refresh of the gate-
way to try to make it more inter-
active and lively," Coleman said.
"And I'm sure that the folks in the
communications (office) would be
interested in feedback."
Lampe also said that student
and faculty feedback is appreci-
ated and encouraged. He and his
colleagues in the Office of the Vice
President for Communications
want to get University-affiliated
individuals involved in the rede-
sign process, he said.
"We want to encourage user
participation, community build-
ing," Lampe said.
Coleman told SACUA members
that she thinks this is a "good
project," but the redesign is going
to be a laborious process.
"(The redesign) is goingto take
a more thorough job," Coleman
told the faculty governing body._

The initial cost to revamp the
gateway website is about $30,000,
and the redesign is anticipated to
cost about $200,000, Lampe said.
"Over the course of the next
year, we plan to work with an
outside vendor to do a formal
assessment - both internal and
external - of the role, and the
effectiveness and the expected
changes that will be required to
have one of the best university
websites in the world," Lampe
said.
Feedback about the new design
has been "overwhelmingly posi-
tive" so far, Lampe said.
Some students, like LSA senior
Mercedes Harvey, who have seen
the updated website said they like
the change.
"I work for the University, so
it's lot easier to have people navi-
gate," Harvey said.
LSA senior Cimone Scott said
he's seen the website changes and
thinks it looks "more playful." But
he saidhe doesn't like the removal
of the express "directory" button.
LSA junior Alex Kaminski
said he hadn't noticed the web-
site's new appearance, but said he
thought the website's old design
was "outdated."
Though LSA junior Josh Mack
said he hasn't seen the altered
website, he said his past experi-
ence with the University gateway
site wasn't the best.
"I thought it was tough to navi-
gate at some points, but not ter-
rible," he said.

Watson plans to focus on
financial difficulties University
students face like the high costs

release issued Sunday.
Campbe -said -minan inter--
view yesterday that he and
Watson are aiming to uphold
the same values established by
the party when it was founded
one year ago.
"We really want to make
sure that we are continuing to
be an advocate for students on
campus, (and) that student gov-
ernment really is the voice of
students on campus," Campbell
said. "We want to do that by
having the most diverse slate of
representatives possible and by
having all voices represented in
the process to make sure we are
advocating for all students."
Current MSA President

Chris Armstrong and Vice
PresidentJason Raymond, who
are the founders of MForward,
endorsed Watson and Campbell
at the convention.
Campbell said he is honored
to have been chosen to carry
on their positions, specifically
after the work they've done in
the past year.
"We're very happy to have
the endorsement of Chris Arm-
strong and Jason Raymond,"
Campbell said. "Students on
campus think that they have
done a tremendous job lead-
ing our government and repre-
senting us to the (University)
administration, so we look for-
ward to continuing and build-
ing upon their legacy next
year."
Campbell said he and Wat-
son plan to campaign for the
upcoming elections by going
on "listening tours," which will
give students the opportunity
to offer comments and voice
their opinions on changes they
wish to see within MSA. Arm-
strong and Raymond did simi-
lar campaigning methods last
year.
Campbell said MForward

plans to contact hundreds of
student organizations to ensure
the party is exposed to many
different perspectives "to rein-
vigorate the executive branch."
"(We are) making sure that
the entire government is lis-
tening to students and making
sure that we're encompassing
all students' beliefs in our advo-
cacy," Campbell said. "We also
want to make sure that we are
steadfast in our commitment to
push for change on campus by,
working with, and sometimes
against, the administration on
campus to make it a better place
for students."
Campbell said his lack of
experience in student govern-
mentiat the University will
benefit MSA, as he is able to
provide a fresh perspective.
"I think it's really helpful to
have someone in the leader-
ship of the student government
who doesn't have preconceived
notions about how to operate
the government," Campbell
said. "I'm really excited about
the possibility of uniting (mine
and Watson's) different experi-
ences to be as effective advo-
cates as possible."

From Page 1
Institute, said in his opening
remarks that the purpose of the
round table discussion was to
provide a source of conversa-
tion following recent events in
Egypt and Tunisia.
"It is a ripe time to have a
conversation like this, but it is
possible that the most dramatic
events are ahead of us," Koll-
man said.
Juan Cole, the Richard P.
Mitchell Collegiate professor of
history at the University, start-
ed the discussion by speaking
about the history of the Egyp-
tian government and the revolu-
tion that has been taking place
in Cairo the past few weeks.
"(President Mosni) Mubarak
represents a complex regime in
Egypt," Cole said. "The April
6, (2008) uprising was the ker-
nel of today's uprising. For the
most part, this is a spontaneous
uprising - they are calling it
The Youth Revolution."
In 2008, a group of protes-
tors in Mahalla, Egypt were
suppressed by the Egyptian
government. The April 6 Youth

Movement, an organization
composed mainly of young peo-
ple, was created as a result and
mobilized mainly through Face-
book and other social network-
ing sites.
The current rebellion in Cai-
ro's Tahrir Square, Cole said,
is a left-wing revolution with
a variety of specific goals like
revitalizing the economy.
"What do they want?" Cole
said. "They want an opening,
they want economic opportu-
nity ... They want the factory
workers to be better paid, better
respected."
Mark Tessler, the Univer-
sity's vice provost for interna-
tional affairs, said he thinks the
uprisings in the Middle East are
due to "injustice and ... hope-
lessness." The goal of the revo-
lutions is to inspire democracy
as citizens search for increased
equality, he said.
"Resources won't go away
over time, and there is unem-
ployment," Tessler said. "Peo-
ple are finding a fundamental
unfairness about it."
Tessler described results
from a research study he has
been conducting to analyze
political sentiments of citizens

in various countries including
Algeria, Tunisia and Egypt.
Based on data he's compiled
thus far, findings show that
most of the subjects demon-
strate an overwhelming support
for democracy.
Public Policy Prof. Susan
Waltz, described the current
revolution in Tunisia as a rise
against the suppressive gov-
ernment instilled under former
Tunisian President Ben Ali.
"I think what most Tunisians
who would identify as middle
class, well educated, would say
they felt infantilized," Waltz
said. "I am passionately opti-
mistic for the rationalist reform
that is rising."
Other speakers during the
discussion included Nadine
Naber, assistant professor of
American culture and women's
studies, Philip Potter, assistant
professor of public policy and
political science, and Joshua
Cole, associate professor of
history. They addressed issues
such as women's roles in the
revolution at Tahrir Square,
media representations of the
Middle East and the impact of
religion on democracy in the
region.

Doubling up on diversity
State needs minority grads with science degrees
University President Mary Sue Coleman has kept the Uni-
versity's focus on a buzzword here on campus - diversity.
Recently, Coleman was in Lansing to celebrate the growth
of the Michigan Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation
initiative, which aims to increase the number of minority students
who graduate with bachelor's degrees in math, science, technology
and engineering. Increasing minority representation in universities
and emphasizing math and science education are important to the
future of the state. University leaders should continue to develop
and enlarge the MI-LSAMP while making tangible efforts toward
achieving its objectives.

Afresh initiative

Healthy food is expensive.
Penny for penny, a bag of
baby carrots is going to
cost you about the same as a combo
meal from Taco
Bell. When
healthy, unpro-
cessed food is up
against fast food
one-on-one -
say, an apple ver-
sus a small order
of fries from M RY
McDonald's - DEMERY
there's more in
question than
just the immediate deliciousness of
the fries. The apple probably costs as
much, if not more. Realistically, this
makes the choice of healthy food
over fast food improbable and infre-
quent for many consumers.
This speaks to a major discrepan-
cy in America. By now it's no secret
that the economy works against
most Americans. Not everyone can
afford to choose broccoli over a
burger. In our country today, the
high cost of produce is enough to
turn millions away from the farm-
er's market, sending people back to
the fast food drive-thru. In terms
of your health, this may not make a
lot of sense, but choosing fast food
certainly seems more cost efficient.
Lowering the often inhibiting
cost of produce is one of the first
steps on the road toward better
shealth-for- all. -Access- to food -
rather than processed ingredients
- shouldn't be a luxury. All citizens
should be able to afford healthy
food, regardless of their socioeco-

nomic status. Unfortunately,there's
not a whole lot consumers can do to
change this. Making produce more
affordable to the masses is some-
thing that big companies must do.
In an unexpected move, Wal-
Mart has made making healthy
foods affordable its priority. In
January, the company announced a
plan to lower the price of produce
and to cut fat, sugar and salt lev-
els in its store brand called Great
value. In addition, Wal-Mart said
it would encourage other manufac-
turers, like Kraft, to do the same.
It's not an empty public relations
promise since the company has
deadlines. Although far away, Wal-
Mart wants everything in place by
2015. Admirable and progressive,
this is a move that isn't character-
istically Wal-Mart - a company
better known for its poor treatment
of employees and displacement of
locally-owned stores.
When I first read about Wal-
Mart's initiative, I was almost
instantly dismissive. I don't shop at
Wal-Mart. Like many Americans,
I don't care for the way Wal-Mart
treats its employees. The company's
signature swoop into small towns,
displacing locally-owned stores, is
unsettling enough to keep me away
from Wal-Mart, however low its
prices may be.
But Wal-Mart's new initiative is
a start. It's hard to deny the impor-
tance of good-health-for all Wal-
Mart pridesitself on its low prices
and caters to millions of Americans,
offering the opportunity - perhaps
more than any other superstore -

to help change our eating habits.
And that's just what Wal-Mart is
addressingwiththis newplan. Even
First Lady Michelle Obama agrees.
She was involved in planning the
project and has, for the first time,
publicly supported a single compa-
ny. Such an endorsement is mean-
ingful, especially since Obama is so
invested in nutrition and fighting
the obesity epidemic.
Healthy food
needs to be
affordable for all.
Nationwide, - Wal-Mart sells
more groceries than any other
store. Not surprisingly, it's also one
of the biggest purchasers of food
in this country. These two facts
alone grant Wal-Mart a significant
amount of power. Wal-Mart has
the ability to - and does - shape
the nation's eating habits. With
this power comes responsibility.
Despite its past failures, Wal-Mart
is tackling the obesity epidemic in a
constructive way. This alone makes
me - an avid anti-Wal-Mart girl -
want to reconsider my opinion. Any
company that addresses the obesity
epidemic on such alarge and well-
considered scale deserves notice.

The Daily disregarded
the rights of embryos
TO THE DAILY:
A human being is a person regardless of
how small he or she is or how he or she is
conceived. We are deeply concerned by the
blatant disregard for the rights of the unborn
in the recent Michigan Daily editorial about
abortion (Insuring the choice, 02/03/2011).
Embryology asserts that human life begins
at conception. Furthermore, the Univer-
sity prides itself in its campaign to "Expect
Respect" from all in spite of one's physical
appearance, level of development, environ-
ment or degree of dependency. Just as we
consider a newborn infant as precious as
any adult, sotoo must we also recognize that
those in the womb deserve the same funda-
mental human rights that we possess.
According to a 2009 CNN poll, more than
60 percent of Americans don't support the
funding of abortion through taxes. The
Daily argues that a woman should have the
right to choose what she does with her body.
Shouldn't the majority of Americans who
find taxpayer-funded abortions repugnant
have the right to choose not to be involved?

The 'U'failed to help the
disabled after the storm
TO THE DAILY:
In regard to the article on snow travel for
disabled students (Snowstorms make campus
travel difficult for disabled, 2/4/2011), I'm a
freshman with a disability, and I have tried
various avenues to expedite the cleaning of
street corners and crosswalks. The sidewalks
were well cleaned, but when I got to the
crosswalks I couldn't cross.
So, I began contacting people. First, I con-
tacted my hall director, and she alerted the
snow plow company, and they told me they
would get right on it. Then by late Thursday
morning nothing had been done, so I con-
tacted disability services and spoke with the
director, Dan Measel, and he gave me the
snow plow number to call, but he didn't dial
them himself. I asked myself why he was ask-
ing me to dial when he is the director of dis-
ability services. I preceded to call the snow
plow company myself, and they told me they
would get on it as soon as possible.
On Friday, many street corners and cross-
walks were still a barrier of hardened snow
or a pool of slush that was impossible to get
through. I even got stuck twice for a few min-
utes each time, but luckily a couple of nice
pedestrians helped me. It isn't easy when my
wheelchair alone weighs approximately 500
pounds. This poses a dangerous situation,
should my chair tip over, and with low tem-
peratures I could have been frostbitten. After
all, if classes are going to be in session during
a blizzard when half the state is shut down, at
least have the crosswalks clean.

y father lives a pretty
safe life. He's an engi-
neer from a small town
with four children and a wife. He
rarely encoun-
ters serious dan-
ger, but he has a
permit to carry a
concealed weap-
on.
My older ,
sister also has
a concealed RACHEL
weapon permit. VAN GILDER
After she turned
21, she took the
class to obtain a CPL - a concealed
pistol license - with my father and
my brother. Because they took the
time to learn to use a weapon prop-
erly and followed the law, there's no
reason why they shouldn't be trust-
ed to carry it.
In Michigan, it's legal to carry
a weapon openly. Concealed weap-
ons are regulated by state law.
Currently, individuals with CPLs
aren't permitted in areas such as
school grounds, college classrooms
and dorms, sports arenas and hos-
pitals.
Legislation has recently been
introduced in the Michigan Sen-
ate to loosen restrictions on where
concealed weapons can be carried.
The proposal has some flaws, but
it's based on a solid concept. Adding
firearms to any situation isn't auto-
matically going to increase safety,
but trusting qualified individuals
with those firearms might.
In a Jan. 31 editorial, the
Michigan Daily argued that the
proposed legislation should be
thrown out (Rethink gun legislation,
01/31/2010). The editorial argued
that adding more firearms to a
dangerous situation makes things
worse, not better.
The Daily said in its editorial
that the shooting in Tucson, Ariz.
in early January was causing peo-
ple to think rashly. But as horrible

as that event was, it wasn't the true
impetus for the legislation. As the
Daily also noted, the sponsor of
the proposal, Sen. Mike Green (R-
Mayville), sponsored similar leg-
islation in 2000. People have been
debating the range of the Second
Amendment for decades. There
are legitimate debates about where
individuals' rights end and the con-
cern for public safety takes over.
It's clear that there are some
places that firearms shouldn't be
allowed. The Daily was right when
it pointed out that schools are one
such place. Allowing weapons to
be in close proximity to so many
children isn't a wise decision. And,
of course, we shouldn't hand out
firearms willy-nilly to any Tom,
Dick or Harry on the street. Some
gun restrictions can be reasonable
- like asking those seeking a CPL
to provide proof of residency and
not be a convicted felon or mentally
unstable. These restrictions don't
step on Second Amendment rights.
They simply ask people to approach
these rights responsibly.
But there are good reasons to
relax concealed carry restrictions,
some of which are unreasonable -
like the ban on firearms in stadiums
and arenas. In these settings, there
are people we trust with weapons
- police officers, for example. We
trust these individuals because
they've been trained to protect the
public and use a weapon conscien-
tiously."
People with CPLs also undergo
some education - they must com-
plete a course in gun safety to
apply for a license. Typically, the
people who choose to complete the
course are people who know how
to use a weapon. My father and
sister, for example, have military
training. And my father has been
using firearms for a few decades.
Admittedly, this doesn't compare
to the training cops get, but it
shows that these individuals are

thinking critically about the use of
a weapon and their obligations as a
citizen - that they're approaching
their rights with a sense of respon-
sibility.
I once asked my father why he
got a CPL. After all, the most dan-
gerous situation he faces is rush
hour traffic. He explained to me
that he made the decision because
it's better to have some people
who know how to use a weapon in
a potentially dangerous situation
than simply allow one dangerous
individual to hurt as many people
as he or she can.
Violence
shouldn't be
considered taboo.
The concerning weapons are the
ones that are illegally obtained -
either bought illegally or stolen -
or illegally concealed by unstable
individuals. There's only so much
that can be done to limit those
weapons, but we can trust stable,
legally-certified people to help pro-
tect public safety.
It's easy to think that maybe the
tragic shooting at Virginia Tech in
2007 would have led to less loss of
life if someone had been able todis-
able the shooter sooner. Not every-
one with a weapon can be trusted,
but it's better to know that some
people - like those who take the
concealed weapons training course
and know how to use their weapon
- are ready totake the responsibil-
ity to protect their fellow citizens.
Violence isn't always the answer,
but it shouldn't be taboo either.

Cut Copy gets in the zone

Outback-bred band
has no rules, is just
right on new release
By CHLOE STACHOWIAK
Daily Arts Writer
Let's face it: There's just some-
thing cool about Australia. Be

beaches on Zonoscope

programs, our
perspective of
the island is drenched in a sum-
mery, effortless appeal. Even the

2000 Olsen Twins movie "Our
Lips Are Sealed" - with its jet
skis, yacht parties and shirtless
blonde surfer dudes - depicts an
enticing portrayal of the country,
in a preteen kind of way.
With the release of their album
Zonoscope, the Melbourne natives
of Cut Copy have granted our
culture yet another gift from the
outback. An intoxicating blend of
disco beats, breezy guitars and
electronic melodies, the album
captures Australian coolnesswith
an '80s pop touch. It's a vibrant
fusion of modern . and retro
sounds, perfect for both loung-
ing under a beach umbrella or as
the background music of a Molly
Ringwald prom scene.
Pounding steadily with drums
and synthesizer, Zonoscope's first

track "Need You Now" opens the
album with strength and style.
The solid rhythm is layered with
clapping hands, twinkling key-
boards and airy background
vocals, creating six lively min-
utes of electronic ecstasy. Nearly
everything about the track is
alluring, leaving the listener long-
ing for more of its pulsating beats
long afterthe end.
"Take Me Over" is as catchy as
its preceding track but shakes up
the techno currents with surfer
flair. As the peppy guitar part
plays behind the animated elec-
tronic melodies, it's easy to fall
prisoner to the song's energy.
Even the vocals of lead singer Dan
Whitford are trancelike, as they
inundate the song with a rich,
steady smoothness.

While most of the tracks
bounce between '80s rock and
techno, some have a more sur-
prising presence on the album.
"Where I'm Going" is one of
these: Between its organ parts
and crooning falsetto vocals,

DEAD SPACE
From Page 5
tors, and this intensity and strat-
egy does wonders to enhance the
experience.
Isaac has a new and improved
telekinetic attachment to his
suit, which greatly increases the
potential for launching sharp
poles or the severed blade-like
appendages of felled Necro-
morphs as weapons. When ammo
is low, it's great to be able to rip off
a dead Necromorph's arm to fire it
at a living one. This improved fea-
ture, which was essentially use-
less in the original "Dead Space,"
is invaluable in the sequel, mak-
ing combat strategic and dynamic
while still maintaining a very
exciting pace. In this respect,
Visceral Games has achieved
quite an accomplishment - even
though the combat has a lot of
similarities to the first game, the
nuance and tactical variation of
each fight is something totally
new to the sequel and makes each
melde extremely rewarding.
There are a lot of ways in which

the gameplay has been expand-
ed, but there are also instances
where new features fall flat. For
instance, the zero-gravity sys-
tem has been changed, but not
for the better. The first "Dead
Space" used gravity boots and
allowed Isaac to jump from wall
to wall, inverting the world with
each leap. In the sequel, Isaac
has jet-powered boots and slowly
scoots around in the zero gravity
environments. There isn't much
combat in this mode - rightly so
because it's so awkward - but as
a result, this slows down the pace
of the game and all the tasks in
this floaty setting become pretty
tedious.
Unfortunately, the storyline
is not nearly as exciting as the
gameplay because "Dead Space 2"
reduces itself to every single sci-
fi and horror stereotype imagin-
able. Radio messages and Isaac's
hallucinations get old fast, and
they become a distraction from
the visceral gameplay. The villain
is hardly fleshed out - in fact, the
term "villain" might not even be
worth using, because there are
multiple antagonists who hardly
have any screen time. These "ene-

mies" basically serve as devices to
extend gameplay by forcing Isaac
to "reroute the power" that was
just shut off, or something equally
tedious. The final moments of the
game are an attempted plot twist
and apoor boss fight, which leave
an unfortunate aftertaste for a
game that generally pleases.
The mutiplayer is more enjoy-
able than not, but as exciting as
being a Necromorph slicing up
humans might seem, it doesn't
feel like the mechanics were fully
figured out. Whether it is from lag
or a poor graphical portrayal, the
Necromorphs seem to die for no
reason and the physical interac-
tion between the two teams looks
clunky.
Despite this, the sound and
graphics in "Dead Space 2" are
even better than in the first game
and do everything to embellish
the persistent feeling of terror
throughout the story. And though
the plot is a little weak, the excit-
ing gameplay more than makes up
for the rough areas.,But it's easy
to ignore the hiccups, because it's
undeniable that Visceral Games
has delivered a thrilling chapter
in the "Dead Space" series.

CUT COPY
From Page 5
the arrangement is heavily - and
unexpectedly - reminiscent of the
Beach Boys. Even the background
vocals are saturated with the '60s
band's style, providing harmony
with "yeah!" and other monosyl-
labic words. The track's shift away
from'80s electro-pop might come
as a curveball, but it's certainly not
an unpleasant one. Like the rest
of Zonoscope, "Where I'm Going"
is quick, fun and fully compatible
with a Frisbee and sunblock.
Alive with its peppy dance
beats, but chill with its fluid
strings and singing, Cut Copy's
Zonoscope has entered the music
world as the picture of Aus-
sie awesomeness. It's an album
appropriate for everyone's favor-
ite island activities, from surf-
ing with the locals to partying
on yachts with Mary-Kate and
Ashley. With this seamless union
of beats and bass, the band has
given the world one more reason
to envy Australia - as if we didn't
already have enough.

SOHONI
From Page 5
traditionalists have feared
the deterioration of theatrical
film-going, and in some ways,
digital distribution may make
those traditionalists fear even
more. With sites like Hulu
successfully attracting TV
viewers away from the televi-
sion itself, what's to stop film
from undergoing a similar
evolution?
The answer is that the the-
ater isn't static. The room may
be the same, but behind the
scenes, theaters are advanc-
ing quickly in their own right.
They are undergoing a digital
remodeling, shifting from
expensive film-reel projec-
tion to less bulky, ultimately
cheaper digital distribution.
Though home video is mak-
ing strides toward matching
theater technology, theaters
are running away from them
by establishing even greater
capital-intensive projection
technology that consumers

can't yet hope to duplicate.
Digital distribution may,
however, threaten our sense
of ownership over films. My
old DVD collection will be a
thing of the past, replaced by
a collection of digital titles
stored in a cloud; pulling a box
off the shelf will be replaced
with a click onto a thumbnail
of a movie poster. To "own"
a film wouldn't be a physical
state at all, but rather the sign
of a digital contract.
The technological trend
towards new distribution -
channels will be largely influ-
enced by the tendency of the
Internet as a whole, and is
only predictable to a point.
Technology will evolve every
day. But the only sure thing in
the future pf home video dis-
tribution is this: The studios
will do what they need to do
to make the most money pos-
sible. Even when faced with
a threat, they'll find a way to
make it their own.

The Mchign Daly -michgandilyco TuedayFebrary{,.201.-.

Hoke did all he could recruiting

Brady Hoke was stuck at
the starting line, waiting.
The gunshot was long
gone. The foot race started a
while ago.
And Michigan's competition
was well on its way to finishing the
race.
How frus-
trating that
must have
been.
There were
three years
of mediocre
football on the TIM
field to deal ROHAN
while rumors
and specula-
tion surroundingthe coach's status
weighed on the program off of it.
Instead of having six weeks to
hand pick his first recruiting class,
Hoke had three weeks from the
day he was hired.
Considering everything stacked
up against him, Hoke's first
recruiting class is all he could ask
for. All Michigan could ask for.
He hauled in six four-star
recruits and 13 three-star recruits,
according to Rivals.com. The Wol-
verines couldn't secure a five-star,
but, for reference, Ohio State only
nabbed one.
According to the coaching
staff, Michigan's haul included a
running back tailor-made for the
offense (Thomas Rawls), a tight
end who can step on the field
immediately (Chris Barnett) and
12 defensive players who can add
depth and maybe push for playing
time - former coach Rich Rodri-
guez was troubled throughout the
season with his defense's lack of
quality reserves.
Michigan's assistant coaches
were on the road for eight days
making recruiting visits to con-
struct this 20-person class. Michi-
gan recruiting coordinator Chris
Singletary woke up some days
wondering what city he was in and
what time of day it was.
The hard work paid off The

Wolverines reaffirmed some of
Rodriguez's commits and gener-
ated a respectable foundation for
the future Hoke is building - one
with a 4-3 defense and pro-style
offense. But that's the story before
any of them puton a winged hel-
met.
It's easyto criticize a class,
compared to those schoolswith
head starts, and one that doesn't
include a single five-star recruit.
But one thing we can point to dur-
ing the Rodriguez tenure and say
is that nothing is guaranteed; that
includes top recruits.
Five-stars can barely see
the field. And four-stars can be
the centerpiece of an explosive
offense. Hoke had to scratch and
claw to get those players to come
to Ann Arbor. Now, it's his job to
coach them up.
"They're going to have to (have
an impact), they're not really going
to have a choice," said Mike Far-
rell, a national recruiting analyst
for Rivals.com. "They're going to
be thrown in there, especially the
defensive guys, and they're going
to have to playa little bit over their
heads.
"I can tell you that a few of
these kids who are ranked three-
stars will be much better than
that. And then a few of these
three-stars, you'll never hear from
them. They'll never see the field.
They'll never crack the two-deep.
Or they'll simply be depth play-
ers that will not make an impact
at all."
The mark of a good coach is one
who can drive and teach and mold
his players into much more. It's
nice to have a solid talent pool to
work with, though.
Aren't you curious what
could've happened if Hoke had
more time to sell Michigan?
Michigan wide receivers coach
Jeff Hecklinski said it was easy to
sell the school - the academics,
the block "M."
It'llbe even easier if the win-
ning returns. Then the higher-

MARISSA MCCLAIN/Daily
Michigan coach Brady Hoke had just three weeks to form his recruiting class.

profile recruits will come too,
especially with two more years
of national exposure thanks to
Denard Robinson highlights and
big matchups on a national stage
(see: Notre Dame night game in
2011 and Alabama at Cowboys'
Stadium in 2012).
The barricade is easyto under-
stand. Michigan Athletic Director
Dave Brandon didn't fire Rodri-
guez until four days after the
Gator Bowl. Coaches like Randy
Shannon at Miami (Fla.) were
let go back in November. And his
replacement, Al Golden, had plenty
of time to salvage a recruiting
class.
We don't know how much the
Wolverines' 52-14 Gator Bowl loss
factored into Brandon's decision.
But he wasn't doing Rodriguez
any favors by keepingthe coach
around while rumors swirled. The
next guy was goingto be stuck
there atthe starting line, anxiously
waiting. Brandon said he made the
decision withthe currentplayers
in mind, so that they had the best
chance to win the team's first bowl
game in three years.
It was noble of Brandon to con-
sider the current players' needs
before the future of the program

- there are few athletic directors
who would do that. But well see if
it comes back to haunt the begin-
ning of Hoke's tenure.
Hindsight is 20-20. Michigan
was embarrassed in the Gator
Bowl and its next coach had a dis-
advantage in recruiting. Atthat
point, all you could expect from
Hoke is what we got - the No. 21
recruiting class in the country,
according to Rivals.com. Not
spectacular, notcterrible --just
okay.
The whole process is cyclical -
recruit, coach, win.
Repeat.
Michigan won't have anything
substantial holding it back next
year, unless Hoke's first season in
Ann Arbor goes as poorly as Rodri-
guez's did. Then, Hoke and the
defense-wiz, Greg Mattison, will
have a legitimate shot at re-filling
the cupboard.
The barricades will fade. And
Hoke will have his chance to be
the front-runner, leaving every-
one else in the dust.

Y9u saw the headline -
go ahead, roll your eyes.
Look at the headline,
now back at me. Now back at the
headline, now back to me.
You've
probably
never had
a negative
thought
about senior
goalie
Shawn
Hunwick. STEPHEN J.
In fact, you NESBITT
didn't even
think about
him during his first two-and-a-
half years on campus. He was
just a second or third-string
option who only had dreamed of
seeing the ice.
But last March, Hunwick
enraptured you, capturing the
collective heart of Wolverine
nation. A fan base that was dev-
astated when its starting goal-
tender went down with a groin
injury in the first period against
Notre Dame was introduced to
its most unlikely hero - a goalie
whose mask barely peeked
above the crossbar in goal.
And after Hunwick spear-
headed Michigan's drive to the
NCAA regional semifinal, you
didn't want to wake from the
fairytale story unfolding before
you. You wanted Hunwick to

take the nation by storm in his
senior season and claim the
starting goaltending position
from the get-go - in the back of
your mind, you felt indebted to
him for the special run.
Perhaps more impressive
than Hunwick's acrobatics
in goal was the way the Wol-
verine defense rallied around
him. Michigan had nothingto
lose - its top goaltender was
gone right before the CCHA
tournament, which was the only
opportunity for the fledgling
Wolverines to advance to their
20th consecutive NCAA Tour-
nament.
And while Hunwick trumped
all expectations, he was the first
to admit that it took a full-team
effort to shut down ranked
opponents like Michigan State,
Northern Michigan, Miami
(Ohio) and Bemidji State.
The consensus entering the
2010-11 season was that it was
Hunwick's job to lose.
But re-enter Bryan Hogan.
The senior groomed to be the
Wolverines' starting goaltender
back as a freshman wasnow the, *
unfamiliar goalie. With Hogan
healthy again for his senior sea-
son, Michigan coach Red Beren-
son elected to platoon the pair,
naming no starter, but rather a
1A, 1B rotation.

For these Wolverines,
look beyond the results 1

MARISSA MCCLAIN/Daily
Senior goaltender Bryan Hogan injured his groin during warmups before the Big Chill at the Big House on Dec. 11.

NESBITT
From Page 7
For most Michigan fans, the lA
was Hunwick. They showed up
in droves expecting Hunwick to
once again leave them thunder-
struck. He held up his end of the
bargain, but the team didn't show
up - in early December he was
stuck with a 2-3-4 record and
only a plus-3 goal differential,
mostly thanks to a 7-2 victory
over Lake Superior State in late
November.
Meanwhile, Hogan was 7-2-0
and receiving plenty of support
on both ends of the ice.
During the week of The Big
Chill at the Big House, Berenson
seemed to be on the cusp of mak-
ing a decision about the starting
job. He named Hogan the starter
for the Big Chill, onlyto have
Hogan reinjure his groin during
the warm-ups and concede the
spot to Hunwick.
Michigan was ina familiar
spot. It was down to a last-resort
goaltender - the only difference
was that this time, the emer-
gency starter had proven himself

before.
In front of the new starting
man, the Wolverines went into
defensive lockdown, making way
for Hunwick to charm the crowd
of more than 100,000 in a daz-
zling 5-0 victory.
While Hogan recuperated for
the next month-and-a-half, Hun-
wick won back the confidence of
any doubters, bumping his record
up to 10-5-4 as the Wolverines
entered February - dropping
just two contests along the way.
When the team traveled to
Oxford, Ohio last weekend, one
familiar face was back on the
Michigan bench: Bryan Hogan.
Bringing him along as the backup
was a signal from Berenson that
Hogan is healthy enough to be
depended on.
After being swept by the
RedHawks, the outlook isn't so
rosy for Berenson's troops. The
defense is crumbling - perhaps
a byproduct of becoming too
dependent on the strong goalten-
ding between the pipes. Hunwick
hasn't done much to disappoint
the team - making save after
save on point-blank opportuni-
ties - but the defense certainly

has.
It's been a one-man show in
the defensive zone. Berenson
hasn't said a dissenting word
about the goaltender because
Hunwick simply isn't allowing
bad goals.
But something has to change,
and it's conceivable that the
goalie situation could swing full-
circle from where it was at this
time last season.
Michigan is searching for a
kick-start to return to Berenson's
mantra of taking care of defense
first, and Hogan might be the
flame to reignite the once red-hot
Wolverines.
Considering the team's pro-
pensityto rally around a new
goaltender, especially when its
back is against the wall, don't
put it past Berenson to put No. 35
back on the ice to give the team a
wake-up call.
Hunwick or Hogan? 1A or 1B?
It's time to reopen the debate.

Fans are prone to overreac-
tions these days.
Pretty quickly after
the Michigan men's basketball
team's road upset over Penn
State on Sunday, the conversa-
tion among supporters turned
to one ques-
tion: can this BEN
team make the ESTES
NCAA Tourna
ment? On Men's
At first Basketball
glance, it seems
like a rather innocuous query
- and then you realize that
such followers are talking about
making the Big Dance this year.
I will admit, there is a win-
dow of opportunity for the
Wolverines to make the tour-
nament this season. But that
window is barely even cracked.
Michigan would probably have
to win around five of its last
seven games before picking up
another victory or two in the
Big Ten Tournament to make
that dream a reality.
Finishing on such a strong
note would be easy if the Wol-
verines were still playing teams
like Gardner-Webb and Bryant,
but they're not - they're in the
heart of their Big Ten schedule,
against arguably the best con-
ference, top-to-bottom, in the
country.
Games like this week's tilts
against Northwestern and
Indiana are being considered as
must-haves. That seems reason-
able, since a tournament-bound
team should theoretically
be expected to take care of
business at home against the
eighth- and 10-place teams in
the Big Ten standings, respec-
tively. Then, you remember that
Michigan already lost to these
two squads by a combined 33
points.
The point is, there's almost no
realistic chance that the Wol-
verines will make the NCAA
field this year. Sure, they're
playing their best basketball of
the year, but they've also been
up-and-down all season, like
most young teams. To expect
them to go on a late-season run
like the one required for a tour-
nament bid is just asking too
much.
But that's fine. It's easy to
forget what the expectations
were for this team going into
the season. Michigan was
expected to be one of the abso-
lute worst teams in the Big Ten,
what with all its youth and
inexperience. Instead, Michi-
gan coach John Beilein has the
Wolverines just a game-and-a-
half out of fourth place in the
conference.
They've played above expec-
tations, but doesn't mean that
we should suddenly readjust
those expectations. As depress-
ing as some would say this
sounds, this year has always

Michigan coach John Beilein led the Wolverines toan NCAA Tournament
berth in 2009. Michigan didn't play ina postseason tournament last season.

been about next year and the
year after - when Beilein will
have the experienced talent
necessary to make a legitimate
tourney run.
So you can't base your
evaluation of Michigan solely
off the results of each game.
Beilein certainly doesn't - he
has repeatedly said he's seeing
things in practice that show
great development among the
Wolverines, and that he's taken
solace in them even during the
stretches of losing.
Lately, some of that has car-
ried over to the real games.
Look at the Ohio State game
last Thursday. Yes, it ended
up being a disappointing loss,
considering Michigan had a
halftime lead and couldn't hold
on against the top-ranked Buck-
eyes.
But you have to look deeper
than that. Consider that Ohio
State opened the game on a 7-0
run, putting the Wolverines
behind early, with the loud-
est crowd I've heard all season
going nuts (no pun intended).
But Michigan didn't fold.
It didn't do what one would
expect such a youngteam to
do. Instead, the players stayed
composed and fought back -
something that just wouldn't
have happened if this game was
played early in the seasoi.
And, yes, everyone criticized
the Wolverine offense for play-
ing subparly, and rightfully so,
because the unit managed just
53 points.
Again, though, you have to
dig deeper than the stats. The
Buckeyes employed a strategy
rarely seen this season against
Michigan, sticking with outside

shooters and forcing the Wol-
verines into a two-man game
with sophomore point guard
Darius Morris and whoever was
in the post.
Michigan didn't execute that
well against it, but for a relative-
ly untalented offensive attack
to have a new type of defense
thrown at it - one it wasn't pre-
pared for - and still manage to
hang in the game until the end
against the nation's No. S team?
That's impressive.
And while the Penn State
game will mostly just be
remembered as a simple win,
there were a lot of positive
developments behind it: that
guard Tim Hardaway Jr. (after
a very freshman-like bout with
foul trouble in the first half)
shook off his rustiness and
spearheaded the Wolverines'
charge in the second half, and
that Michigan started the game
playing extremely poor - on the
road, against a solid team - and
still won in the end.
Those are two more achieve-
ments that this inexperienced
bunch wouldn't have pulled off
when the season began.
Michigan is growing - that
was seen against Penn State and
the loss to Ohio State, and will
continue to be seen the rest of
the season - win or lose.
The Wolverines probably
aren't going to the NCAA Tour-
nament, but they're showing
more and more that they'll
surely be there next year, which
is what really matters for this
group.
And there's always the NIT.
For a developing Michigan team
- this season - that's still a
great thing.

CLUB LACROSSE
'M' seeks fourth-straight title

By JOHN EPPLER
Daily Sports Writer
Over the past three years, the
Michigan men's lacrosse team
has been near unbeatable, earn-
ing three consecutive MCLA
National Championship titles.
In fact, the seniors on the team
have yet to have a season that did
not end in a championship.
Over that three year span,
the team has won an impres-
sive 58 games, and lost only one.
The team's success has put them
into the national spotlight, with
rumors of a future rise to Divi-
sion-I status becoming more and
more widespread.
"The bottom line is that Dave
Brandon and the athletic depart-
ment are working toward that
goal," Michigan coach John Paul
said.
While this year's team is
younger than in the past, expec-
tations for Michigan are still
high. For a team with the sort
of success that the Wolverines
have recently achieved, the only
acceptable end to a season is a
championship.
"I think when you have got-
ten to the point of success that
we have had over the past years,

winning a championship has to
be a goal," Paul said.
But the team has suffered
some major losses.
Most of these are concentrat-
ed to the midfield, with the loss
of last year's faceoff specialist
David Reinhard being among
the most notable. His near 70
percent faceoff success rate
was an advantage easy to get
accustomed to and is difficult to
replace.
"We are going to be relying
on kids who may not have had
huge impacts-in previous sea-
sons," senior captain and start-
ing defender Harry Fried said.
"We have alot of new guys in the
mix, and that makes ita little bit
exciting, but a little different at
the same time."
Some of these issues sur-
faced in the 18-11 preseason
loss against Bellamine, a NCAA
Division-I opponent. Several
holes in the Wolverine defense
were exposed and faceoffs were
inconsistent. Even with the
minor hiccups, Paul wasn't con-
cerned.
"Our scrimmage last week
exposed some things that we
still need to be working on,"
Paul said. "But, that's what these

scrimmages are for. We worked
on our defense in practice this
week."
The team continued to work
through the preseason, using it
to get better and hit stride come
the beginning of the season.
In their most recent matchup,
the team earned a better result
defeating Wittenberg by a score
of 13-9 on Friday.
Still, faceoffs and defense
have been the weak links for
Michigan after two pre-season
games.
Nonetheless, a high powered
offense lead by seasoned stars
like senior attackman Trevor
Yealy was enough to put the t
Wolverines past Wittenberg.
"We are going to have to find
a faceoff guy who will have his
own way of success," Fried said.
"I think what we are goingto
see, is that the guys filling in are
going to give this team its own
identity."
Despite key losses due to
graduation, the Michigan men's
lacrosse team believes that they
will continue to experience the
success that they have become
accustomed to.
Only a championship is
acceptable.
